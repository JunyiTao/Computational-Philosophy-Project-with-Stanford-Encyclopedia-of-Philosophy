    "main_text": "For Which Entities Does the Question of Moral Status Arise?\n1. For Which Entities Does the Question of Moral Status Arise?\n\nA variety of applied ethics debates regarding how certain beings\n\u2013 human beings, non-human animals, and even ecosystems \u2013\nshould be treated hinge on theoretical questions about their moral\nstatus and the grounds of that moral status. It is these theoretical\nquestions that are the focus of this entry, but a quick survey of the\napplied ethics debates helpfully allows us to identify which entities\nhave been thought to have moral status.\n\nIt is usually taken for granted that all adult cognitively unimpaired\nhuman beings have FMS. Of course, historically the moral status of\npeople falling into a group perceived as \u201cother,\u201d such as\nforeigners, racial minorities, women, the physically disabled, etc.\nhas been routinely denied. Either they were not seen as having any\nmoral status, or if they were granted some status, it was not FMS.\nHowever, accounting for their status does not pose much of a\ntheoretical challenge (see section 5.1) and nowadays their status is\nrarely explicitly and directly denied on principled moral grounds.\n\nBy contrast, constructing plausible theories that account for the\nmoral status of other human beings \u2013 not only the degree of\ntheir status, but in some cases also whether they have it at all\n\u2013 is more challenging (see section 5). Debates about disability\nrights and the permissibility of eugenics rest in part on theoretical\ndisagreements about the moral status of cognitively impaired humans.\nThese issues include controversies regarding the treatment of\ncognitively disabled infants, such as the past U.S. practice of\nallowing infants with Down syndrome to die. Debates concerning\nabortion, stem cell research (see the entry on the\n ethics of stem cell research),\n and the question of what to do with unused frozen embryos from in\nvitro fertilization also rest on the theoretical question of the moral\nstatus of extremely underdeveloped human beings at various stages of\ndevelopment: zygote, embryo, and fetus (see section 5.2). The moral\nstatus of both underdeveloped and cognitively impaired human beings is\noften taken to be at issue when it comes to the use of\npre-implantation genetic diagnosis and amniocentesis. In addition,\nmedical advances that prolong life, as well as debates about\neuthanasia, have led people to question the moral status of humans\nincapable of consciousness, such as those in a persistent vegetative\nstate and anencephalic babies (born without the higher brain).\n\nHumans are not the only beings about whom we might ask if they have\nmoral status, and if so, to what degree. The\n moral status of animals\n is also of concern. Debates regarding the treatment of livestock\n(e.g., raising calves for veal, burning off the beaks of chickens,\netc.), management of wild animals (e.g., killing wolves to protect\nlivestock, killing deer in response to their overpopulation, etc.),\nand the creation and design of zoos rest, in part, on the moral status\nof domesticated and wild animals. In some cases the ethical question\nof an animal\u2019s treatment arises because of the discovery of\ntheir cognitive sophistication (e.g., dolphins, elephants, and great\napes), which is taken to have a bearing on the theoretical issue of\ntheir moral status.\n\nWe have already noted that, while there are disagreements from one\nculture to another, and even within a single culture, both\nhistorically and at any given time, there is also significant\nagreement, at least among non-philosophers, that all cognitively\nunimpaired human adults have the highest degree of moral status. But,\nin addition, non-philosophers in principle, if not always in practice,\naccept the same view regarding all cognitively unimpaired human\ninfants as well as human infants and adults with mild to severe\ncognitive impairments (as we use the term, \u201csevere cognitive\nimpairment\u201d excludes those incapable of consciousness). That is,\nthey hold that infants and the cognitively impaired, whether their\nimpairment is intellectual or emotional, have not merely higher moral\nstatus than most animals, but also have FMS. We will call this the\ncommonsense view. By contrast, there is no such consensus about the\nmoral status of human fetuses, humans incapable of consciousness, and\neven sophisticated animals like great apes.\n\nNonetheless, providing an adequate theory to account for the FMS of\nunimpaired infants and cognitively impaired human beings (whether\ninfants or adults) without attributing the same status to most animals\nhas proven very difficult. In fact, our survey in section 5 suggests\nthat this challenge has not been fully met by any of the existing\naccounts of the grounds of moral status. Some philosophers have, as a\nresult, questioned or even abandoned this seemingly commonsense view,\nincluding the aspect that holds that all adult cognitively\nunimpaired human beings have FMS (see the end of section\n4).\n\nIt is important to note that questions of moral status \u2013 having\nit at all as well as the degree to which it is had \u2013 arise not\nonly for humans and non-human animals, but also for any living\nbeing/entity (such as a tree), as well as for entire species,\necosystems, and non-living entities, such as mountains or a natural\nlandscape (see the entry on\n environmental ethics).\n\nIn section 5 we will discuss how a range of humans (developed, and in\nvarious stages of underdevelopment, unimpaired and impaired),\nnon-human animals, species, and ecosystems fare with respect to\nvarious accounts of the grounds of moral status.\n",
