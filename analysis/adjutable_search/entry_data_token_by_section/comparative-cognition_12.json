    "main_text": "Methodological Challenges || Underdetermination\n3.3 Underdetermination\n\nA major challenge in comparative cognition is that claims about\ncognition are often underdetermined by behavioral evidence. As\nTomasello and Call note, \u201cthe exact same behavior may be\nunderlain by very different cognitive mechanisms\u201d (2008: 451).\nBroadly, a hypothesis is underdetermined when the available evidence\nfails to indicate what we should believe about that hypothesis (see\nentry on\n underdetermination of scientific theory).\n For example, if two hypotheses are equally supported by the available\ndata, we might not be able to choose between them (contrastive\nunderdetermination). Or if a hypothesis is found to be incompatible\nwith an empirical result, we might not know whether to reject that\nhypothesis or some other background assumption instead (holist\nunderdetermination). Problems of underdetermination are found\nthroughout the sciences. However, this problem is particularly salient\nin the cognitive sciences, given the opaque and complex nature of\ncognitive systems.\n\nWe encountered an example of contrastive underdetermination when\ndiscussing cognitive and associative accounts of behavior\n (section 2.2).\n There we saw that some competing hypotheses appear to be equally well\nsupported by the empirical data: for example, causal reasoning and\nassociative learning accounts of problem-solving behaviors in corvids\n(see Taylor, Medina, et al. 2010). If it is true that,\n\u201cassociative hypotheses can be constructed post-hoc for\nevery experimental outcome\u201d (Starzak & Gray 2021: 4), then\nsimply finding that one\u2019s causal-reasoning hypothesis fits a\nparticular experimental outcome will not be sufficient to accept it\nover the available associative hypotheses. Instead, one must appeal to\nother factors, like epistemic values\n (section 2.3)\n to determine hypothesis choice.\n\nAnother major source of underdetermination in comparative cognition is\nthat the structure and function of target cognitive phenomena are\noften uncertain and open to revision. For example, since the 1970s, a\nsignificant amount of research has been dedicated to determining\nwhether nonhuman great apes like chimpanzees have \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d (ToM) or the ability to attribute mental states to other\nagents. In their classic paper initiating this research program, David\nPremack and Guy Woodruff write:\n\n\nwe speculate about the possibility that the chimpanzee may have a\n\u201ctheory of mind\u201d, one not markedly different from our own.\n(Premack & Woodruff 1978: 515)\n\n\nHowever, they add that a chimpanzee\u2019s ToM may differ from human\nToM in important respects\u2014e.g., in the type of mental states\ninferred. Moreover, throughout work on animal ToM, researchers\u2019\nunderstanding of the target phenomenon and relevant background\nassumptions have changed in response to new findings. For example,\nrather than rejecting the hypothesis that chimpanzees attribute\nperceptual states to other agents, researchers have interpreted some\nnegative results as due to other factors (e.g., lack of ecological\nvalidity or poor experimental design) (Hare et al. 2000; Kaminski et\nal. 2004; Br\u00e4uer et al. 2007). This has then led to proposals\nregarding what additional experimental controls are needed to\nsuccessfully detect a relationship between the independent and\ndependent variables (see\n section 2.1).\n Philosophers have noted that such revised understandings of the\ntarget phenomenon play an important role in the biological and\ncognitive sciences (Bechtel 2008; Bechtel & Richardson 1993\n[2010]). Nevertheless, revising the phenomenon in this way leads to\nunderdetermination: in the face of conflicting data, it is unclear\nwhether researchers should reject the target hypothesis or revise it\n(an instance of holistic underdetermination).\n",
