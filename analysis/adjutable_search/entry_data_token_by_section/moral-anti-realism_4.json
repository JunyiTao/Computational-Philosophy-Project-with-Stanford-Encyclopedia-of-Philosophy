    "main_text": "Arguing For and Against Moral Anti-realism || Error Theory\n3.2 Error Theory\n\nThe error theorist is a cognitivist: maintaining that moral judgment\nconsists of beliefs and assertions. However, the error theorist thinks\nthat these beliefs and assertions are never true. (The error theorist\ncontrasts here with what can be called the \u201csuccess\ntheorist.\u201d) Moral judgments are never true because the\nproperties that would be necessary to render them\ntrue\u2014properties like moral wrongness, moral goodness, virtue,\nevil, etc.\u2014simply don\u2019t exist, or at least are not\ninstantiated. Defenders of moral error theory include Mackie 1977,\nHinckfuss 1987, Joyce 2001, and Olson 2014.\n\nIf I assert that my dog is a reptile, then I\u2019ve asserted\nsomething false\u2014though in this case there are other things that\nare reptiles. If I assert that my dog is a unicorn then again\nI\u2019ve asserted something false\u2014though in this case\nthere\u2019s nothing in the actual world to which I could attach the\npredicate \u201c\u2026 is a unicorn\u201d and end up with a true\nassertion. The error theorist thinks that employing moral discourse is\nrather like talking about unicorns, though in the case of unicorns\nmost people now know that they don\u2019t exist, while in the case of\nmoral properties most people are unaware of the error. To be an error\ntheorist about unicorns doesn\u2019t require that you think unicorns\nare impossible creatures; it\u2019s enough that you think\nthat they simply don\u2019t actually exist. In the same way, to be a\nmoral error theorist doesn\u2019t require that you think that moral\nproperties couldn\u2019t possibly exist; it would be enough to think\nthat they are never actually instantiated. (Note that there may be a\ndifference between saying \u201cProperty P is never actually\ninstantiated\u201d and \u201cProperty P doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d\nbut that\u2019s a problem for metaphysicians to sort out. Holding\neither view with respect to moral properties is enough to make one a\nmoral error theorist.)\n\nTo be an error theorist about unicorns does not mean that every\nassertion involving the word \u201cunicorn\u201d is false. There\nwould be no error, for example, in asserting \u201cUnicorns do not\nexist,\u201d \u201cThe ancient Greeks believed that unicorns lived\nin India,\u201d or \u201cMy dog is not a unicorn.\u201d What is\ndistinctive about these three sentences is that one would not, in\nasserting them, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\n(It would be rather troubling if this were not true of the first, in\nparticular!) Similarly, the moral error theorist may allow that the\nfollowing are true: \u201cMoral wrongness does not exist,\u201d\n\u201cAugustine believed that stealing pears was wrong,\u201d and\n\u201cStealing is not morally wrong.\u201d\n\nThe last example (\u201cStealing is not morally wrong\u201d) calls\nfor an extra comment. In ordinary conversation\u2014where,\npresumably, the possibility of moral error theory is not considered a\nlive option\u2014someone who claims that X is not wrong\nwould be taken to be implying that X is morally good or at\nleast morally permissible. And if \u201cX\u201d denotes\nsomething awful, like torturing innocent people, then this can be used\nto make the error theorist look awful. But when we are doing\nmetaethics, and the possibility of moral error theory is on the table,\nthen this ordinary implication breaks down. The error theorist\ndoesn\u2019t think that torturing innocent people is morally wrong,\nbut doesn\u2019t think that it is morally good or morally permissible\neither. It is important that criticisms of the moral error theorist do\nnot trade on equivocating between the implications that hold in\nordinary contexts and the implications that hold in metaethical\ncontexts.\n\nThe sentence \u201cUnicorns exist\u201d is false, but there are\nnevertheless various contexts where one might have reason to utter the\nsentence: telling a story, joking, acting, speaking metaphorically,\ngiving an example of a two-word sentence, etc. What is distinctive\nabout these contexts is that one would not be asserting the\nsentence, and thus (as before) one would not, in making these\nutterances, be committing oneself to the existence of unicorns.\nSimilarly, the moral error theorist might propose that we carry on\nsaying things like \u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d but in a\nmanner that deprives our utterances of ontological commitment to moral\nproperties and, thus, removes the error from our discourse.\nIf the error theorist proposes to accomplish this by modeling moral\nlanguage on a way that familiar engagement with fictions nullifies\ncommitment, then such a moral error theorist is a\nfictionalist. (See entry for\n fictionalism;\n see also Kalderon 2005; Joyce 2017.) Other moral error theorists may\nthink that we would be better off if we pretty much eliminated moral\ntalk from our thoughts and language. Such moral error theorists are\nknown as \u201cabolitionists\u201d or \u201celiminativists.\u201d\n(I say \u201cpretty much\u201d since presumably even the\nabolitionist allows that we can carry on using moral language in the\ncontext of plays, jokes, etc.) (For debate between fictionalists and\nabolitionists, see Garner & Joyce 2019.)\n\nError theory is commonly defined as the view that moral judgments are\n(i) truth-evaluable but (ii) always false. But there are various\nreasons for preferring to render (i) as a claim about speech\nacts\u2014that moral judgments aim at the truth (i.e., they\nare assertions)\u2014and (ii) as the broader claim that moral\njudgments are \u201cuntrue\u201d rather than \u201cfalse.\u201d\nOne might, for example, be drawn to error theory because one thinks\nthat there is a sufficient amount of indeterminacy, fragmentation, or\nconfusion surrounding moral concepts that the judgments that employ\nthem, while satisfying the conditions for being beliefs and\nassertions, do not satisfy the conditions for having truth value.\nPerhaps, for example, moral concepts are historically derived from a\ntheistic framework within which they made sense, yet removed from\nwhich they are mere remnants that evoke strong intuitions but, upon\nexamination, make no sense. (See Anscombe 1958; MacIntyre 1984.) If\nthis is so, then it may be argued that the concept moral\nwrongness is just so ill-defined that someone who makes the moral\njudgment \u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d fails to put forward\na proposition that could be true; but since the speaker and audience\nare presumably unaware of this fact, the judgment should still count\nas an assertion. (One needs to tread carefully here. The proposal that\nmoral judgments lack truth value is traditionally associated with\nnoncognitivism. But the noncognitivist thinks that moral judgments\nlack truth value because they are not assertions at all. The error\ntheorist, by contrast, thinks that moral judgments are\n(typically) asserted, but that they fail to be true. Failing to have a\ntruth value is one way of failing to be true. Being false is the other\nway.)\n\nMost arguments for moral error theory, however, presuppose that moral\nconcepts do have a reasonably determinate content, but that there is\nsimply nothing in the world to satisfy this content. The traditional\nform of argument for moral error theory, thus, has two steps. First,\nthe error theorist undertakes the conceptual step of\nestablishing that in participating in moral discourse we commit\nourselves to the world being a certain way (that it contains certain\ninstantiated properties, etc.). Then the error theorist undertakes the\nontological step of establishing that the world is not that\nway. The latter may be achieved (in principle, at least) either\nthrough a priori means or through a posteriori\nmethods.\n\nOne example of an argument with this structure is as follows. First it\nis noted that \u201cS morally ought to \u03c6\u201d is true\nonly if S is a moral agent. The further conceptual steps of\nthe argument then seek to establish that in order to be moral agent,\nS must have the capacity to perform actions that are morally\nblameworthy and praiseworthy, and that these capacities presuppose\nthat S has a certain kind of control over their actions. The\nontological step of the argument then seeks to establish that no such\nautonomous control exists in nature; it\u2019s an illusion. (See\nentry for\n skepticism about moral responsibility.)\n A couple of iterations of modus tollens then take us to the\nconclusion that \u201cS morally ought to \u03c6\u201d is\nnever true.\n\nThe argument just sketched would locate the moral error in a mistake\nwe make about the kind of creatures we are. The more widely discussed\narguments, however, locate the moral error in a mistake we make about\nthe kind of world we inhabit. John Mackie (who coined the term\n\u201cerror theory\u201d in 1977) argues that when we participate in\nmoral discourse we commit ourselves to the existence of objective\nvalues and objective prescriptions, but there are no such things.\nEssentially, Mackie argues that the moral realist is correct about\nmorality conceptually speaking\u2014we are moral\nrealists\u2014but the moral realist is incorrect about how the world\nactually is. Moral facts place demands upon us, but (Mackie asks) how\ncould such demands exist objectively? This would\nseem to require rules of conduct somehow written into the fabric of\nthe universe, and nothing in our understanding of the objective\nnaturalistic world (Mackie goes on) suggests that anything of the kind\nexists. Mackie famously calls such properties \u201cqueer\u201d (in\nwhat seems now an increasingly anachronistic use of the term).\n\nMackie occasionally cashes out his \u201cargument from\nqueerness\u201d in terms of practical reasons. He writes that\n\u201cto say that [objective prescriptions] are intrinsically\naction-guiding [which is one way he sometimes describes the\nnormativity whose existence he denies] is to say that the reasons that\nthey give for doing or for not doing something are independent of that\nagent\u2019s desires or purposes\u201d (Mackie 1982: 115). Surely if\nsomeone is morally required to do something (Mackie thinks), then that\nperson must have a reason to do it. (After all, if one were to deny\nthis, then what kind of \u201cnormative teeth\u201d would moral\nproperties have? \u201cYes, I know that X is morally wrong,\nbut I have no reason to avoid moral wrongness, so the wrongness of\nX is nothing to me\u201d would become, in principle, an\nacceptable thing to say.) But since morality often seems to demand\nthat we do things that we don\u2019t want to do, then morality seems\nto imply the existence of reasons to do things that we don\u2019t\nwant to do. One could, at this point, simply throw up one\u2019s\nhands and claim that such reasons would be too weird to countenance.\nBut one could also go beyond the \u201cargument from queerness\u201d\nby instead arguing methodically that a Humean (instrumentalist) theory\nof reasons for action\u2014according to which reasons ultimately\ndepend on our ends\u2014is superior to any form of practical\nnon-instrumentalism. (See entry for\n reason for action: internal and external.)\n According to such a view, the practical non-instrumentalist is\ncorrect about morality conceptually speaking\u2014in\nengaging in moral discourse, we commit ourselves to\nnon-instrumentalist reasons\u2014but the practical\nnon-instrumentalist is incorrect about how the world actually is: a\nHumean theory of reasons for action is more defensible. (It is worth\nnoting that endorsing Humean instrumentalism about reasons for action\ndoes not in any obvious way commit one to the endorsement of\ninstrumentalism about other kinds of reasons, such as epistemic\nreasons. See Joyce 2019; Cowie 2019.)\n\nIf an argument for moral error theory has two steps\u2014the\nconceptual and the ontological\u2014then there are two places to\nobject. If we consider Mackie\u2019s argument, for example, then one\nkind of opponent will agree that objective values and prescriptions\nwould be too weird to countenance, but maintain that it doesn\u2019t\nmatter because moral discourse is not committed to the existence of\nsuch strange creatures. Another kind of opponent will agree with\nMackie that morality is committed to the existence of objective values\nand prescriptions, but maintain that there is nothing particularly\nstrange about them.\n\nError theorists must be prepared to defend themselves on both fronts.\nThis job is made difficult by the fact that it may be hard to\narticulate precisely what it is that is so troubling about morality.\nThis failure need not be due to a lack of clear thinking or\nimagination on the error theorists\u2019 part, for the thing that is\ntroubling them may be that there is something deeply mysterious about\nmorality. The moral error theorist may, for example, perceive that\nmoral imperatives are imbued with a kind of mystical practical\nauthority\u2014a quality that, being mysterious, of course\ncannot be articulated in terms satisfactory to an analytic\nphilosopher. Such an error theorist is forced to fall back on vague\nmetaphors in presenting their case: Moral properties have a\n\u201cto-be-pursuedness\u201d to them (Mackie 1977: 40), moral facts\nwould require that \u201cthe universe takes sides\u201d (Burgess\n[1978] 2007), moral believers are committed to \u201cdemands as real\nas trees and as authoritative as orders from headquarters\u201d\n(Garner 1994: 61), and so on. Indeed, it may be the vague, equivocal,\nquasi-mystical, and/or ineliminably metaphorical imponderabilia of\nmoral discourse that so troubles the error theorist. (See Hussain\n2004.)\n\nEven if the error theorist can articulate a clear and determinate\nproblematic feature of morality, the dispute over whether this quality\nshould count as a \u201cnon-negotiable component\u201d of morality\nhas a tendency to lead quickly to impasse, for there is no accepted\nmethodology for deciding when a discourse is \u201ccentrally\ncommitted\u201d to a given thesis. What is evidently needed is a\nworkable model of the identity criteria for concepts (allowing us\nconfidently to either affirm or deny such claims as \u201cThe concept\nof moral obligation is the concept of an objective\nrequirement\u201d)\u2014but we have no such model, and there is no\nconsensus even on what approximate shape such a model would take.\n\nIt is also possible that the most reasonable account of conceptual\ncontent will leave many concepts with significantly indistinct\nborders. There may simply be no fact of the matter about whether moral\ndiscourse is committed to the existence of non-instrumental reasons\n(for example). Thinking along these lines, David Lewis makes use of\nthe distinction between speaking strictly and speaking loosely:\n\u201cStrictly speaking, Mackie is right: genuine values would have\nto meet an impossible condition, so it is an error to think there are\nany. Loosely speaking, the name may go to a claimant that deserves it\nimperfectly \u2026 What to make of the situation is mainly a matter\nof temperament\u201d (Lewis [1989] 2000: 93). Lewis\u2019s own\ntemperament leads him to seek to vindicate value discourse, and he\nthinks that this can be done by supporting a dispositional theory of\nvalue (of a kind to be discussed in the next section). But since there\nis no logical or methodological requirement that we should prefer\nspeaking loosely over speaking strictly, or vice versa, then this\nwould leave the dispute between moral error theorists and success\ntheorists a fundamentally undecidable matter\u2014there may simply be\nno fact of the matter about who is correct.
