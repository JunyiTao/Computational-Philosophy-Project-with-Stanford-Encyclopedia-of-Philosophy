Given that all physical substances (apart\nfrom the elements themselves) are mixtures of elements, how do the\nelements exist in them? (Maier 1952; Grant 1974, \u00a777, Eichner\n2005, 139\u2013145). Avicenna\u2019s answer is that the substantial\nforms of the elements remain unaltered when a compound is formed; only\nthe qualities of the elements are altered and unite to a mean quality\n(qualitas media), or complexion (complexio). The\ncomplexion disposes the matter to receive the substantial form of the\ncompound from the active intellect, the giver of forms (dator\nformarum) (The Healing: Physics I.10, On\ngeneration 6). The problem with this position, as many\nscholastics saw, is that several bodies are combined in one, which do\nnot form a true mixture. Averroes rejects Avicenna\u2019s theory and\nargues that the substantial forms of the elements are diminished in\nthe compound (Comm. magnum De caelo III.67). The form of the\ncompound is \u201ccomposed\u201d of the elementary forms (Comm.\nmagnum Metaph. XII.22). In order not to violate Aristotle\u2019s\nprinciple that substantial forms cannot be diminished or augmented (a\nman is not more man than another), Averroes argued that elementary\nforms are not substantial forms in the full sense.\n\nA third influential alternative was proposed by Thomas Aquinas. Thomas\nargued that the substantial forms of the elements are destroyed and\nthat only the qualities contribute to the mixture. Thomas shares\nAvicenna\u2019s conviction that every form presupposes a certain\nmaterial disposition, which is the mean quality characteristic of the\ncompound. But he deviates from Avicenna in that the forms of the\nelements are not preserved; they are only virtually present in the\ncompound, in that their powers survive (De mixtione\nelementorum, cf. Summa theol. Ia q. 76 a. 4).\nThomas\u2019 position found many adherents. Its problem is that\nphysical bodies cannot truly be called mixtures of elements.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of the permanence of substantial forms was\noften mentioned, but rarely accepted in the Latin West.\nAverroes\u2019 position, that the elementary forms can be diminished\nand augmented, found many supporters, among them Henry of Ghent,\nPetrus Johannes Olivi, Richard of Middleton, John of Jandun and\nseveral members of the Merton school of the fourteenth century (Maier\n1952, 36\u201346). Many authors accept Averroes\u2019 position with\nmodifications, especially by reinterpreting the thesis of the\nintension and remission of elementary forms. Henry Bate and Dietrich\nof Freiberg argue that the diminished forms assume the character of\npotential forms and thus join the matter of the compound; the form of\nthe compound is a form added to these diminished forms. For Averroes,\nin contrast, the combination of the diminished forms was identical\nwith the new form of the compound. In the Renaissance, the issue\ncontinued to be discussed. There was disagreement even among the\nfollowers of Averroes. Some, as Marcantonio Zimara, held that the form\nof the compound was added to the other forms, others, as Jacopo\nZabarella, argued against such addition (Maier 1952, 46\u201369).\n",
