    "main_text": "No Rights Due to Contingency of Future People Upon Our Decisions? || Derek Parfit\u2019s No-Difference View and the Disjunctive Notion of Harm\n3.2 Derek Parfit\u2019s No-Difference View and the Disjunctive Notion of Harm\n\nDerek Parfit has introduced the \u201cNo-Difference View\u201d: It\nmakes no (theoretical or practical) difference to how we should act,\nall things considered, whether the size and composition of future\ngenerations depend upon our present decision or not. The relevant\nreasons are the same or have the same strength.\n\nTo what extent we can defend that view will depend on how we\nunderstand the relation between the notions of harm as distinguished\nin\n Section 3.1.\n Here we will delineate two views of how to understand these notions\nof harm and investigate the question of the extent to which these two\nalternative views support Parfit\u2019s \u201cNo-Difference\nView\u201d. According to our first view, one must choose between the\n\u201csingle threshold\u201d and the \u201csingle\nsubjunctive-historical\u201d notion of harm: to claim that\nrights-considerations can guide us in choosing among long-term\npolicies we will have to adopt one of these notions of harm as\nspecifying necessary conditions of harm; in doing so, we have to deny\nthat the other notion specifies necessary (or sufficient) conditions\nof harm. In other words, the first view considers the \u201csingle\nthreshold\u201d and the \u201csingle subjunctive-historical\u201d\nnotion of harm as exclusive notions. According to the second view, the\nthreshold notion of harm and the subjunctive-historical notion can be\ncombined.\n\nAccording to this \u201cdisjunctive notion\u201d the necessary\ncondition for harming is the disjunction of the conditions for harming\nas set out by the notions of harm at\n (II)\n and\n (III).\n The proposal is this: instead of interpreting accounts of harm at\n(II) and (III) as providing alternative necessary conditions for\nharming, we can take these two notions to provide the disjuncts for a\nnecessary condition for harming. This disjunctive notion of harm\nsubstitutes yet a fourth necessary condition of what it means to harm\nsomeone:\n\n(IV)\n (disjunctive) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\) harms\nsomeone only if either the conditions of harming as in\n III\n or as in\n II\n are fulfilled.\n\n\nWe clearly ought to prefer the disjunctive notion to the single\nsubjunctive-historical view according to which the\nsubjunctive-historical notion of harm specifies necessary conditions\nof harm (and the threshold notion at\n (III)\n specifies neither necessary nor sufficient conditions). The\ndisjunctive notion is compatible with the thesis of this entry that\nrelies upon our employing a threshold notion of harm where the\nsubjunctive-historical and the diachronic notions do not\n apply.[11]\n Some authors also argue that being worse off than the same person was\nor would have been is not a necessary condition for harm where the\nidentity of the person is independent of the harming action (Hanser\n1990; Shiffrin 1999; Harman 2004: 98\u2013101; Woollard 2012:\n681\u2013683; but see Roberts 2009: 19\u201320). Ought we to prefer\nthe disjunctive notion to the single threshold notion according to\nwhich the threshold condition is a necessary condition of harm? The\nadvantage of the disjunctive notion is that this view of harm allows\nus to rely on the subjunctive-historical notion of harm whenever it is\napplicable, that is, when we will harm an existing person. In these\ncases the notion of harm at\n (II)\n provides us with what most consider a straightforward account of the\nharm caused (see also\n \u00a75.2).\n\nConsider the type of case where we can act in a way that diminishes\nthe well-being of a person who lives above any plausibly construed\nthreshold. However, we will diminish the person\u2019s well-being to\na level still clearly above the threshold. For example, someone breaks\ninto the garage of a mansion and steals the new convertible while the\nwealthy owner is at his penthouse in the city. This theft is not\nlikely to cause the wealthy person\u2019s well-being to fall below\nany plausibly construed threshold of harm, and thus according to\n (III)\n does not harm him. This seems implausible. Such a case is normally\nunderstood as a case in which the affected person is clearly harmed.\nMore generally, the objection is that the threshold conception is\nunder-inclusive in interpreting which acts we consider harmful.\n\nThe single threshold view by itself does not provide us with a\nresponse to this objection. For a plausible substantive specification\nof a threshold notion (see\n \u00a74.3\n below) will not include a concern for the well-being of those above\nthe threshold. Thus, in responding to the objection we would have to\nadd an additional obligation. For example, we could appeal to the\nadditional obligation of minimizing harm to other persons: The\nobligation requires that we not cause another person to fall to a\nlower level of well-being quite independently of the level of\nwell-being the person already realizes. What counts as a lower level\nof well-being can be measured by the specified threshold.\n\nOn the other hand, the disjunctive notion allows us to rely on the\nnotion of harm at\n (II).\n This provides us with a straightforward account of the harm caused.\nThus, the disjunctive notion is not open to the objection as stated.\nHowever, while the single threshold view can be shown to be fully\ncompatible with Parfit\u2019s No-Difference View, the disjunctive\nnotion of harm raises difficult questions of interpretation of its\nown.\n\nParfit illustrates the No-Difference View by considering two medical\nprograms (1984: 367). In each case a certain rare condition can be\npassed from mother to child. One involves pregnancy testing. If the\ntest comes out positive, fetuses are treated for the rare condition.\nThe other involves preconception testing. The women who test positive\nas carriers of the rare condition are told to postpone conception for\nat least two months and to undergo (harmless) treatment after which\nthe condition will have disappeared. Available funds can be spent on\none or the other program, and the other must be cancelled. Assuming\nthat both programs have equivalent effects on parents, that the\nconditions lead to the same particular handicap in children, and that\nthe two programs will achieve a similar success rate, the programs\ndiffer only in affecting actual people (pregnancy testing) or possible\npeople (preconception testing). The (practical) no-difference view\nsays: our reason to prevent harm to possible future people (those who\nmight be conceived) is as strong as our reason to prevent harm to\nactual people (those already conceived who will develop from the\nalready existing fetuses in due course). The two medical programs in\nParfit\u2019s example are equally worthy and it makes no moral\ndifference which is cancelled.\n\nIs the disjunctive notion of harm compatible with the no-difference\nview, thus understood? Here we cannot discuss the implications of the\ndisjunctive notion in any detail. We might first observe that both the\nsubjunctive-historical and threshold notions of harm can be employed\nto interpret many core cases of harm. That is to say, both sets of\nconditions as specified by the two notions of harm will arguably be\nsatisfied in many cases where most people agree that harm was\ncaused\u2014at least under plausible construals of both notions of\nharm. Second, in the cases in which not both sets of conditions\nobtain, we still find that harm was caused, namely, as long as at\nleast one set of conditions obtains. If the threshold notion of harm\napplies, we find that harm was caused. The disjunctive notion entails\nthat canceling either test causes harm.\n\nHowever, the disjunctive notion does not entail that it makes no\npractical difference which test we cancel. A plausible interpretation\nof the disjunctive notion might be the following: satisfying either\nset of the conditions provides a reason for objecting to the proposed\naction; if both sets of conditions obtain, the objection is presumably\nstronger than when only one set of conditions obtains. According to\nthis understanding of the disjunctive notion and assuming that in\nParfit\u2019s example of the two medical programs the children, if\neither they or their mothers are not treated, will suffer a severe\nhandicap, the objection to canceling pregnancy testing is stronger\nthan the objection to canceling the preconception testing program.\nBecause the handicap is severe, the children will fall below the\nthreshold and the threshold notion of harm provides the same reason\nfor objecting to canceling either program. But if pregnancy testing is\ncancelled this will be worse for the children who are not\ntreated\u2014the subjunctive-historical notion of harm applies. The\nsubjunctive-historical notion of harm does not, however, provide a\nreason for objecting to cancellation of preconception testing. The\nchildren who will be born handicapped would never have existed if\nthere had been testing prior to\n conception.[12]\n This understanding of the disjunctive notion may not, then, be\ncompatible with the no-difference view. An alternative understanding\nwould deny that where both notions of harm are applicable this\nstrengthens the objection to the harmful act. Whether this strengthens\nthe objection and, if so, how much more is a matter of future research\n(see Woollard 2012: 684\u2013689).\n\nThe single threshold interpretation of harm is also compatible with a\nsecond and stronger understanding of the no-difference view (Woodward\n1986: sects. II and III; Parfit 1986: 856\u2013859): there is no\ntheoretical difference in harming possible future people and\nharming actual people since the very same reasons hold against harming\neither group. The disjunctive notion is clearly incompatible with the\ntheoretical understanding of the no-difference view. According to the\ndisjunctive notion it would often not be true that the same reasons\nhold against harming either such group. When we object to the harming\nof actual people we will often have additional reasons that reflect\nthe fact that the subjunctive-historical notion of harm applies.\n",
