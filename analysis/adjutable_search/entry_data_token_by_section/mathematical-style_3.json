But do mathematicians\nrecognize the existence of styles in mathematics? Once again, it would\nnot be difficult to give isolated quotes where mathematicians might\ntalk about the style of the ancients or the abstract algebraic style\nor categorial style. In logical work one finds occurrences of style in\nsuch denominations as \u2018Bishop-style constructive\nmathematics\u2019. What are difficult to find are systematic\ndiscussions by mathematicians of the notion of style. The case of\nBieberbach was mentioned above but no detailed discussion of the\nexamples he adduced as evidence of differences in style was given\nthere, partly because they are so twisted by his desire to provide\nsupport for his ideological point of view that there are reasons to\ndoubt that one would gain much by way of an analysis of his case\nstudies.\n\nAn interesting contribution is an article by Claude Chevalley from\n1935 titled \u201cVariations du style\nmath\u00e9matique\u201d. Chevalley takes the existence of\nstyle for granted. He begins as follows:\n\nMathematical style, just like literary style, is subject to important\nfluctuations in passing from one historical age to another. Without\ndoubt, every author possesses an individual style; but one can also\nnotice in each historical age a general tendency that is quite well\nrecognizable. This style, under the influence of powerful mathematical\npersonalities, is subject every once in a while to revolutions that\ninflect writing, and thus thought, for the following periods.\n(Chevalley 1935, 375)\n\n\nHowever, Chevalley did not try to reflect on the notion of style here\ninvolved. Rather he was concerned to show by means of an important\nexample the features of the transition between two styles of doing\nmathematics that had characterized the passage from nineteenth century\nmathematics to twentieth century approaches. The first style described\nby Chevalley is the Weierstrassian style, \u2018the style of\n\u03b5\u2019. It finds its \u2018raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre\u2019 in the need to rigorize the calculus\nmoving away from the unclarities related to such notions as\n\u201cinfinitely small quantity\u201d etc. The development of\nanalysis in the nineteenth century (analytic functions, Fourier\nseries, Gauss\u2019 theories of surfaces, Lagrangian equations in\nmechanics etc.) led to a critical analysis\n\nof the algebraic-analytical framework in front of which they found\nthemselves; and it is from this critical examination that a completely\nnew mathematical style was to emerge. (Chevalley 1935, 377)\n\n\nChevalley went on to single out the discovery of a continuous nowhere\ndifferentiable function, due to Weierstrass, as the most important\nelement of this revolution. As Weierstrass\u2019 function can be\ngiven in terms of a Fourier expansion with a quite normal appearance,\nit became obvious that many demonstrations in mathematics assumed\nclosure condition that needed to be rigorously established. The\nconcept of limit, as defined by Weierstrass, was the powerful tool\nthat allowed such investigations. The reconstruction of analysis\npursued by Weierstrass and his followers turned out to be not only\nfoundationally successful but also mathematically fruitful. Here is\nhow close Chevalley comes to characterizing this style:\n\nThe use on the part of the mathematicians of this school of the\ndefinition of limit due to Weierstrass can be noticed in the external\nappearance of their writings. First of all, in the intensive, and at\ntimes immoderate, usage of the \u201c\u03b5\u201d equipped with\nvarious indexes (this is the reason why we have spoken above of a\nstyle of the \u201c\u03b5\u201ds). Secondly, in the progressive\nreplacement of equality for inequality in the demonstrations as well\nas in the results (approximation theorems; upper bound theorems;\ntheory of increase, etc.). This last aspect will occupy us for it will\nmake us understand the reasons that forced the overcoming of the\nWeierstrassian style of thinking. Indeed, while equality is a relation\nthat is meaningful for mathematical beings whatsoever, inequality can\nonly be applied to objects equipped with an order relation,\npractically only on the real numbers. In this way one was led, in\norder to embrace all of analysis, to reconstruct it entirely from the\nreal numbers and from functions of real numbers. (Chevalley 1935,\n378\u2013379)\n\n\nOut of this approach one could also build the system of complex\nnumbers as pair of reals and the points of spaces in n\ndimensions as n-tuples of reals. This gave the impression\nthat mathematics could be unified by means of constructive definitions\nstarting from the real numbers. However, things went differently and\nChevalley tries to account for the reasons that led one to give up\nthis \u201cconstructive\u201d approach in favor of an axiomatic\napproach. Various algebraic theories, such as group theory gave rise\nto relationships that could not be constructed starting from the real\nnumbers. Moreover, the constructive definition of complex numbers was\nequivalent to fixing an arbitrary reference system and thus endowing\nthese objects with properties that hid their real nature. On the other\nhand one was familiar with Hilbert\u2019s axiomatization of geometry\nwhich, although rigorous, did not have the character of artificiality\nof the constructive theories. In this case the entities are not\nconstructed but rather defined through the axioms. This approach\ndeveloped to influence analysis itself. Chevalley mentioned the theory\nof Lebesgue integral that was obtained by first setting down what\nproperties the integral had to satisfy and then showing that a domain\nof objects satisfying those properties existed. The same idea was used\nby Frechet by setting down the properties that were to characterize\nthe operation of limit thereby arriving at a general theory of\ntopological spaces. Another example mentioned by Chevalley is the\naxiomatization of field theory given by Steinitz in 1910. Chevalley\nconcluded that\n\nThe axiomatization of theories has modified very deeply the style of\ncontemporary mathematical writings. First of all, for every result\nobtained, one always needs to find out which ones are the strictly\nindispensable properties needed to establish it. One will seriously\naddress the problem of giving a minimal demonstration of such result\nand to that effect one will need to delimit exactly in which domain of\nmathematics one is operating in such a way as to reject methods that\nare foreign to this domain since the latter are likely to bring about\nthe introduction of useless hypotheses. (Chevalley 1935, 382)\n\n\nMoreover, the constitution of domains that are perfectly suited to\ncertain operations allows one to establish general theorems on the\nobjects under consideration. In this way one can characterize the\noperations of infinitesimal analysis algebraically but without any of\nthe na\u00efvet\u00e9 which had characterized the previous algebraic\napproaches.\n\nChevalley\u2019s article is a precious source from a contemporary\nmathematician on the topic of style. He forcefully shows the\ndifference between the late nineteenth century arithmetization of\nanalysis and the early twentieth century axiomatic-algebraic approach.\nHowever, it has its limitations. The notion of style is not thematized\nas such and it is not clear that the features adduced to explain the\nparticular historical events might provide the general tools for\nanalyzing other transitions in mathematical style. But perhaps that\nshould, if anything, be the task of a philosopher of mathematics (for\na detailed analysis of Chevalley\u2019s approach to style see Rabouin\n2017; for further developments, focused on Bourbaki style, see Marquis 2021).\n",
