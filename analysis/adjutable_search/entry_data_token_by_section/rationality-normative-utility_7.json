Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 discuss\nexamples where rationality seems to permit preferences inconsistent\nwith expected utility theory. These examples suggest that\nmaximizing expected utility is not necessary for\nrationality. Section 3.2.3 discusses examples where expected\nutility theory permits preferences that seem irrational. These\nexamples suggest that maximizing expected utility is not\nsufficient for rationality. Section 3.2.4 discusses an\nexample where expected utility theory requires preferences that seem\nrationally forbidden\u2014a challenge to both the necessity and the\nsufficiency of expected utility for rationality.\n3.2.1 Counterexamples Involving Transitivity and Completeness\n\n\nExpected utility theory implies that the structure of preferences\nmirrors the structure of the greater-than relation between real\nnumbers. Thus, according to expected utility theory, preferences\nmust be transitive: If \\(A\\) is preferred to \\(B\\)\n(so that \\(U(A) \\gt U(B)\\)), and\n\\(B\\) is preferred to \\(C\\) (so that \\(U(B)\n\\gt U(C)\\)), then \\(A\\) must be preferred to\n\\(C\\) (since it must be that \\(U(A) \\gt U(C)\\)).\nLikewise, preferences must be\ncomplete: for any two options, either one must be preferred to\nthe other, or the agent must be indifferent between them (since of\ntheir two utilities, either one must be greater or the two must be\nequal). But there are cases where rationality seems to permit (or\nperhaps even require) failures of transitivity and failures of\ncompleteness.\n\n\nAn example of preferences that are not transitive, but nonetheless\nseem rationally permissible, is Quinn\u2019s puzzle of the\nself-torturer (1990). The self-torturer is hooked up to a machine\nwith a dial with settings labeled 0 to 1,000, where setting 0 does\nnothing, and each successive setting delivers a slightly more powerful\nelectric shock. Setting 0 is painless, while setting 1,000 causes\nexcruciating agony, but the difference between any two adjacent\nsettings is so small as to be imperceptible. The dial is fitted\nwith a ratchet, so that it can be turned up but never down. \nSuppose that at each setting, the self-torturer is offered $10,000 to\nmove up to the next, so that for tolerating setting \\(n\\), he\nreceives a payoff of \\(n {\\cdot} {$10,000}\\). It is permissible for the\nself-torturer to prefer setting \\(n+1\\) to setting \\(n\\) for\neach \\(n\\) between 0 and 999 (since the difference in pain is\nimperceptible, while the difference in monetary payoffs is\nsignificant), but not to prefer setting 1,000 to setting 0\n(since the pain of setting 1,000 may be so unbearable that no amount of\nmoney will make up for it.\n\n\nIt also seems rationally permissible to have incomplete\npreferences. For some pairs of actions, an agent may have no\nconsidered view about which she prefers. Consider Jane, an\nelectrician who has never given much thought to becoming a professional\nsinger or a professional astronaut. (Perhaps both of these\noptions are infeasible, or perhaps she considers both of them much\nworse than her steady job as an electrician). It is false that\nJane prefers becoming a singer to becoming an astronaut, and it is\nfalse that she prefers becoming an astronaut to becoming a\nsinger. But it is also false that she is indifferent between\nbecoming a singer and becoming an astronaut. She prefers becoming\na singer and receiving a $100 bonus to becoming a singer, and if she\nwere indifferent between becoming a singer and becoming an astronaut,\nshe would be rationally compelled to prefer being a singer and\nreceiving a $100 bonus to becoming an astronaut.\n\n\nThere is one key difference between the two examples considered\nabove. Jane\u2019s preferences can be extended, by\nadding new preferences without removing any of the ones she has, in a\nway that lets us represent her as an expected utility maximizer. \nOn the other hand, there is no way of extended the\nself-torturer\u2019s preferences so that he can be represented as an\nexpected utility maximizer. Some of his preferences would have to\nbe altered. One popular response to incomplete preferences is to\nclaim that, while rational preferences need not satisfy the axioms of a\ngiven representation theorem (see section 2.2), it must be possible to\nextend them so that they satisfy the axioms. From this weaker\nrequirement on preferences\u2014that they be extendible to a\npreference ordering that satisfies the relevant axioms\u2014one can\nprove the existence halves of the relevant representation\ntheorems. However, one can no longer establish that each\npreference ordering has a representation which is unique up to\nallowable transformations.\n\n\nNo such response is available in the case of the self-torturer,\nwhose preferences cannot be extended to satisfy the axioms of expected\nutility theory. See the entry on\n preferences\n for a more extended discussion of the self-torturer case.\n3.2.2 Counterexamples Involving Independence\n\n\nAllais (1953) and Ellsberg (1961) propose examples of preferences that\ncannot be represented by an expected utility function, but that\nnonetheless seem rational. Both examples involve violations of\nSavage\u2019s Independence axiom:\n\n\nIndependence. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(A^*\\) are two\nacts that produce the same outcomes in the event that \\(E\\) is\nfalse. Then, for any act \\(B\\), one must have\n\n\n\n\\(A\\) is preferred\nto \\(A^*\\) if and only if \\(A_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\)\nis preferred to \\(A^*_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\)\n\n\nThe agent is\nindifferent between \\(A\\) and \\(A^*\\) if and only if she is\nindifferent between \n\\(A_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\) and \\(A^*_E \\amp B_{\\sim E}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, if two acts have the same consequences whenever\n\\(E\\) is false, then the agent\u2019s preferences between those\ntwo acts should depend only on their consequences when \\(E\\) is\ntrue. On Savage\u2019s definition of expected utility, expected\nutility theory entails Independence. And on Jeffrey\u2019s\ndefinition, expected utility theory entails Independence in the\npresence of the assumption that the states are probabilistically\nindependent of the acts.\n\n\nThe first counterexample, the Allais Paradox, involves two separate\ndecision problems in which a ticket with a number between 1 and 100 is\ndrawn at random. In the first problem, the agent must choose\nbetween these two lotteries:\n\n\nLottery \\(A\\)\n\n\u2022\n$100 million with certainty\n\n\n\n\nLottery \\(B\\)\n\n\n\u2022\n$500 million if one of tickets 1\u201310 is drawn\n\n\n\n\u2022\n$100 million if one of tickets 12\u2013100 is drawn\n\n\n\n\u2022\nNothing if ticket 11 is drawn\n\n\n\nIn the second decision problem, the agent must choose between these\ntwo lotteries:\n\n\nLottery \\(C\\)\n\n\u2022\n$100 million if one of tickets 1\u201311 is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nNothing otherwise\n\n\n\n\nLottery \\(D\\)\n\n\u2022\n$500 million if one of tickets 1\u201310 is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nNothing otherwise\n\n\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to prefer \\(A\\) (which offers a sure $100\nmillion) to \\(B\\) (where the added 10% chance at $500 million is\nmore than offset by the risk of getting nothing). It also seems\nreasonable to prefer \\(D\\) (an 10% chance at a $500 million prize)\nto \\(C\\) (a slightly larger 11% chance at a much smaller $100\nmillion prize). But together, these preferences (call them the\nAllais preferences) violate Independence. Lotteries\n\\(A\\) and \\(C\\) yield the same $100 million prize for\ntickets 12\u2013100. They can be converted into lotteries \\(B\\)\nand \\(D\\) by replacing this $100 million prize with $0.\n\n\nBecause they violate Independence, the Allais preferences are\nincompatible with expected utility theory. This incompatibility does\nnot require any assumptions about the relative utilities of the $0,\nthe $100 million, and the $500 million. Where $500 million has\nutility \\(x\\), $100 million has utility \\(y\\), and $0 has utility \\(z\\),\nthe expected utilities of the lotteries are as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n EU(A) &= 0.11y + 0.89y \\\\\n EU(B) &= 0.10x + 0.01z + 0.89y \\\\\n EU(C) &= 0.11y + 0.89z \\\\\n EU(D) &= 0.10x + 0.01z + 0.89z\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the condition under which \\(EU(A) \\gt EU(B)\\) is\nexactly the same as the condition under which \\(EU(C) \\gt EU(D)\\): both\ninequalities obtain just in case \\(0.11y \\gt 0.10x +\n0.01z\\) \n\n\nThe Ellsberg Paradox also involves two decision problems that generate\na violation of the sure-thing principle. In each of them, a ball is\ndrawn from an urn containing 30 red balls, and 60 balls that are\neither white or yellow in unknown proportions. In the first decision\nproblem, the agent must choose between the following lotteries:\n\n\nLottery \\(R\\)\n\n\u2022\nWin $100 if a red ball is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nLose $100 otherwise\n\n\n\n\nLottery \\(W\\)\n\n\u2022\nWin $100 if a white ball is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nLose $100 otherwise\n\n\n\nIn the second decision problem, the agent must choose between the\nfollowing lotteries:\n\n\nLottery \\(RY\\)\n\n\u2022\nWin $100 if a red or yellow ball is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nLose $100 otherwise\n\n\n\n\nLottery \\(WY\\)\n\n\u2022\nWin $100 if a white or yellow ball is drawn\n\n\n\u2022\nLose $100 otherwise\n\n\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to prefer \\(R\\) to \\(W\\), but at the same time prefer\n\\(WY\\) to \\(RY\\). (Call this combination of preferences the Ellsberg\npreferences.)  Like the Allais preferences, the Ellsberg\npreferences violate Independence. Lotteries\n\\(W\\) and \\(R\\) yield a $100 loss if a yellow ball is\ndrawn; they can be converted to lotteries \\(RY\\) and \\(WY\\)\nsimply by replacing this $100 loss with a sure $100 gain.\n\n\nBecause they violate independence, the Ellsberg preferences are\nincompatible with expected utility theory. Again, this incompatibility\ndoes not require any assumptions about the relative utilities of\nwinning $100 and losing $100. Nor do we need any assumptions about where\nbetween 0 and 1/3 the probability of drawing a yellow ball\nfalls. Where winning $100 has utility \\(w\\) and losing $100 has\nutility \\(l\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n EU(R) &= \\tfrac{1}{3} w + P(W)l + P(Y)l \\\\\n EU(W) &= \\tfrac{1}{3} l + P(W)w + P(Y)l \\\\\n EU(RY)&= \\tfrac{1}{3} w + P(W)l + P(Y)w \\\\\n EU(WY)&= \\tfrac{1}{3} l + P(W)w + P(Y)w\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the condition in which \n\\(EU(R) \\gt EU(W)\\) is exactly the same as the condition\nunder which \n\\(EU(RY) \\gt EU(WY)\\):\nboth inequalities obtain just in case \n\\(1/3\\,w + P(W)l \\gt 1/3\\,l + P(W)w\\).\n\n \n\nThere are three notable responses to the Allais and Ellsberg\nparadoxes. First, one might follow Savage (101 ff) and Raiffa (1968,\n80\u201386), and defend expected utility theory on the grounds that\nthe Allais and Ellsberg preferences are irrational. \n \n\nSecond, one might follow Buchak (2013) and claim that that the\nAllais and Ellsberg preferences are rationally permissible, so that\nexpected utility theory fails as a normative theory of\nrationality. Buchak develops an a more permissive theory of\nrationality, with an extra parameter representing the decision-maker\u2019s\nattitude toward risk. This risk parameter interacts with the utilities\nof outcomes and their conditional probabilities on acts to determine\nthe values of acts. One setting of the risk parameter yields expected\nutility theory as a special case, but other, \u201crisk-averse\u201d\nsettings rationalise the Allais preferences.\n\n\nThird, one might follow Loomes and Sugden (1986), Weirich (1986),\nand Pope (1995) and argue that the outcomes in the Allais and Ellsberg\nparadoxes can be re-described to accommodate the Allais and Ellsberg\npreferences. The alleged conflict between the Allais and Ellsberg\npreferences on the one hand, and expected utility theory on the other,\nwas based on the assumption that a given sum of money has the same\nutility no matter how it is obtained. Some authors challenge this\nassumption. Loomes and Sugden suggest that in addition to monetary\namounts, the outcomes of the gambles include feelings of disappointment\n(or elation) at getting less (or more) than expected. Pope\ndistinguishes \u201cpost-outcome\u201d feelings of elation or\ndisappointment from \u201cpre-outcome\u201d feelings of excitement,\nfear, boredom, or safety, and points out that both may affect outcome\nutilities. Weirich suggests that the value of a monetary sum\ndepends partly on the risks that went into obtaining it, irrespective\nof the gambler\u2019s feelings, so that (for instance) $100 million as\nthe result of a sure bet is more than $100 million from a gamble that\nmight have paid nothing. \n\n\nBroome (1991, Ch. 5) raises a worry about this re-description\nsolution. Any preferences can be justified by re-describing\nthe space of outcomes, thus rendering the axioms of expected utility\ntheory devoid of content. Broome rebuts this objection by suggesting\nan additional constraint on preference: if \\(A\\) is preferred to\n\\(B\\), then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must differ in some way that justifies\npreferring one to the other. An expected utility theorist can then\ncount the Allais and Ellsberg preferences as rational if, and only if,\nthere is a non-monetary difference that justifies placing outcomes of\nequal monetary value at different spots in one\u2019s preference\nordering.\n3.2.3 Counterexamples Involving Probability 0 Events\n\n\nAbove, we\u2019ve seen purported examples of rational preferences\nthat violate expected utility theory. There are also\npurported examples of irrational preferences that satisfy expected\nutility theory.\n\n\nOn a typical understanding of expected utility theory, when two acts\nare tied for having the highest expected utility, agents are required\nto be indifferent between them. Skyrms (1980, p. 74) points out\nthat this view lets us derive strange conclusions about events with\nprobability 0. For instance, suppose you are about to throw a\npoint-sized dart at a round dartboard. Classical probability\ntheory countenances situations in which the dart has probability 0 of\nhitting any particular point. You offer me the following lousy\ndeal: if the dart hits the board at its exact center, then you will\ncharge me $100; otherwise, no money will change hands. My\ndecision problem can be captured with the following matrix:\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\nhit center (\\(P=0\\))\nmiss center (\\(P=1\\))\n\n\nacts\naccept deal\n\\(-100\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\nrefuse deal\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\nExpected utility theory says that it is permissible for me to accept\nthe deal\u2014accepting has expected utility of 0. (This is so on\nboth the Jeffrey definition and the Savage definition, if we assume\nthat how the dart lands is probabilistically independent of how you\nbet.) But common sense says it is not permissible for me to accept the\ndeal. Refusing weakly dominates accepting: it yields a better\noutcome in some states, and a worse outcome in no state. \n\n\nSkyrms suggests augmenting the laws of classical probability with an\nextra requirement that only impossibilities are assigned probability 0.\nEaswaran (2014) argues that we should instead reject the view that\nexpected utility theory commands indifference between acts with equal\nexpected utility. Instead, expected utility theory is not a\ncomplete theory of rationality: when two acts have the same expected\nutility, it does not tell us which to prefer. We can use\nnon-expected-utility considerations like weak dominance as\ntiebreakers.\n3.2.4 Counterexamples Involving Unbounded Utility\n\n\nA utility function \\(U\\) is bounded above if there is a limit to how\ngood things can be according to \\(U\\), or more formally, if there is\nsome least natural number \\(sup\\) such that for every \\(A\\) in \\(U\\)\u2019s\ndomain, \\(U(A) \\le sup\\). Likewise, \\(U\\) is bounded below if there is a\nlimit to how bad things can be according to \\(U\\), or more formally, if\nthere is some greatest natural number \\(inf\\) such that for every\n\\(A\\) in \\(U\\)\u2019s domain, \\(U(A) \\ge inf\\). Expected utility\ntheory can run into trouble when utility functions are unbounded\nabove, below, or both.\n\n\nOne problematic example is the St. Petersburg game, originally\npublished by Bernoulli. Suppose that a coin is tossed until it lands\ntails for the first time. If it lands tails on the first toss, you win\n$2; if it lands tails on the second toss, you win $4; if it lands\ntails on the third toss, you win $8, and if it lands tails on the\n\\(n\\)th toss, you win $\\(2^n\\). Assuming each dollar is worth one\nutile, the expected value of the St Petersburg game is\n\n\\[\n(\\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot 2) + (\\tfrac{1}{4} \\cdot 4) + (\\tfrac{1}{8} \\cdot 8) + \\cdots \n  + (\\tfrac{1}{2^n} \\cdot 2^n) + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots = \\infty\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt turns out that this sum diverges; the St Petersburg game has\ninfinite expected utility. Thus, according to expected utility\ntheory, you should prefer the opportunity to play the St Petersburg\ngame to any finite sum of money, no matter how large. \nFurthermore, since an infinite expected utility multiplied by any\nnonzero chance is still infinite, anything that has a positive\nprobability of yielding the St Petersburg game has infinite expected\nutility. Thus, according to expected utility theory, you should\nprefer any chance at playing the St Petersburg game, however\nslim, to any finite sum of money, however large.\n\n\nNover and H\u00e1jek (2004) argue that in addition to the\nSt. Petersburg game, which has infinite expected utility, there are\nother infinitary games whose expected utilities are undefined, even\nthough rationality mandates certain preferences among them.\n\n\nOne response to these problematic infinitary games is to argue that\nthe decision problems themselves are ill-posed (Jeffrey (1983, 154);\nanother is to adopt a modified version of expected utility theory that\nagrees with its verdicts in the ordinary case, but yields intuitively\nreasonable verdicts about the infinitary games (Thalos and Richardson\n2013) (Fine 2008) (Colyvan 2006, 2008) (Easwaran 2008).\n",
