Schlegel\u2019s Influence in German and European Romanticism: The Athenaeum and the Lectures\n\nDespite the emphasis the \u2018Romantics\u2019 laid on the\nindividual artist, the figure of the genius, originality, and\nindividuality in general (cf. Schulte-Sasse [1985] 1988:\n136\u2013137), the conceptualization of the Romantic Movement itself\nneeds to be understood essentially as a collective process.\nAnd yet, as problematic as it may be to ascribe the original\nconception of the romantic aesthetical and philosophical precepts to\none author alone, A.W. Schlegel\u2019s influence in the\nconceptualization as well as the dissemination of some of the most\ncharacteristic and informing principles of German\nRomanticism\u2014including the term \u2018Romantic\u2019\n(romantisch) itself (cf. Ferber 2005)\u2014is by no means\ntrivial. Indeed, if the periodical Athenaeum (which A.W.\nSchlegel co-edited and co-created with his brother Friedrich) was to\nbecome the \u2018organ\u2019 of the Romantic Movement, it is\nundisputable that A.W. Schlegel\u2019s popular lectures in Jena\n(1798), Berlin (1801\u20131804), and Vienna (1808\u20131812)\n\u201cdisseminated the aesthetics of German Romanticism across\nEurope\u201d (Engel and Lehmann 2004: 84).\n\nThe Romantic Movement emerged, on the one hand, as a reaction against\nClassicist and Neoclassicist aesthetical ideals (largely based on\nmimesis and representation, Behler 1993: ix), and on the other, as a\ncritique from the somewhat blind faith in reason set up by the\nEnlightenment and which had proved to be unsatisfactory. Until the\ncreation of the Athenaeum, A.W. Schlegel had published some\nof his writings in Friedrich Schiller\u2019s periodical Die\nHoren (which was to Weimar Classicism what the Athenaeum would be\nto German Romanticism). Both he and his brother, Friedrich, however\nsoon realized that their particular aesthetic views, philosophical\ninsights, and literary criticisms (which they shared or thought to\nshare with a number of authors such as Novalis, Tieck, Fichte, and\nSchleiermacher) needed a new, adequate space to be published without\nconstraints. The Athenaeum was created with precisely this\nview in mind and was to provide an alternative space that was open to\nnew aesthetic ideas. And although it was conceived as a collective\nwork with an intended and welcomed diversity of positions, styles, and\nliterary forms (letters, aphorisms, dialogues, literary criticism,\netc.), their main idea was that they would publish only those pieces\nthat they could consider as \u201ctheir own\u201d (A: I, iv). In\neffect: there were two editors, several writers, and a diversity of\nopinions, but one unifying principle (A: I, vi). The\nAthenaeum thus became the hotbed for powerful, original and\nphilosophically revolutionary ideas and insights about poetry,\nliterature, and art in general (cf. Paulin 2016: 118). \n\nBut, in order for these ideas to have the transformative effect that\nthe German Romantic movement actually had within and beyond Germany,\nthey needed to be not only systematized and organized into a more\ntangible unit, but also disseminated to broader audiences. This is\nprecisely the role that A.W. Schlegel\u2019s lectures played (cf.\nFranzel 2014). As Jochen Schulte-Sasse, argues: Schlegel\u2019s\nBerlin Vorlesungen \u00fcber sch\u00f6hne Kunst und Literatur\n(\u2018Lectures on Fine Arts and Literature\u2019), which he gave\nbetween 1801 and 1804, \u201chave to be seen as a programmatic\nattempt to explain early Romantic theories of art in a relatively\n\u2018popular\u2019 and accessible form\u201d (Schulte-Sasse [1985]\n1988: 136). Indeed, the last series of these lectures\n(1803\u20131804) were dedicated entirely to the \u2018History of\nRomantic Literature\u2019. These Berlin lectures, however, were not\npublished until 1884 (and to my knowledge never translated into\nEnglish), but Schlegel made an effort to circulate them; for instance\nhe sent them to Schelling, who then used them for his own Jena\nlectures on art. To be sure, Schlegel\u2019s later Vienna lectures,\nwhich were translated into several languages and rapidly disseminated\nacross Europe, were largely based on his Berlin lectures.\n\nThroughout his lectures and essays, A.W. Schlegel praised the plays of\nShakespeare and Calder\u00f3n to the detriment of French\nNeoclassical theatre. This criticism was not arbitrary, but was part\nof a systematic and organic comprehension of art and art history.\nHowever, his harsh attack on classical rules considered\n\u2018sacred\u2019 by French critics predisposed the latter to react\nwith hostility (especially to the publication of the polemical\nComparaison entre la Ph\u00e8dre de Racine et celle\nd\u2019Euripide, in 1807), whilst being favored by English\nreviewers. In fact, the rediscovery of Shakespeare\u2019s greatness\nin the 19th century was due, not only to Schlegel\u2019s\ntranslations, but most importantly to his special approach to\nShakespearean theatre: instead of comparing Shakespeare to ancient\nTragedy, as if it were a bad copy, Schlegel claimed it should be\nanalyzed on the grounds of constituting a necessary and historical\ndifference. This difference\u2014the difference between the\nancients and the modern\u2014was the cornerstone of Schlegel\u2019s\ncritique and set the basis for his theoretical use of the concept\nRomantic, which became the key-concept in his comprehension\nand reevaluation of modernity.\n\nIn effect, most commentators credit A.W. Schlegel for having given the\nword \u2018romantic\u2019 a systematic significance and affirmative\ntone from the very beginning (Furst 1969: 84). In contrast with other\nliterary critics who used the term in contradictory and erratic ways\n(or avoided it altogether, such as Schelling, even if he based his\naesthetics on the difference between the Ancient and the Modern),\nSchlegel believed it was important to transmit a clear-cut\nunderstanding of the term and \u201cto elevate it again to its true\nsignification\u201d (LDA: 441). Indeed, his purpose was to foster a\nsolid movement that should become the symbol of modernity and Germany\nas well as Europe, as he clearly indicates in the introduction to his\nBerlin lectures: \n\n\nI say, I hope to fully dispel the doubt that still arises here and\nthere as to whether there really is a romantic, i.e., specifically\nmodern art: an art that does not follow the model of the Ancient and\nis nevertheless appreciated as fulfilling the highest principles\n[\u2026], a perfectly achieved art; in other words, I hope to dispel\nthe doubt that there is a poetry that is not merely nationally and\ntemporarily interesting, but universal and eternal. (VLK: III, 7)\n\n\nAlthough subject to scholarly debate (Esterhammer 2002a: 153),\nSchlegel\u2019s profound influence on English Romanticism through\nColeridge is widely accepted. Some authors even claim that Coleridge\nfound in Schlegel\u2019s lectures the lucidity and sharpness\nregarding some of the main romantic principles and criticisms that he\nhad lacked until his encounter with the Vorlesungen \u00fcber\ndramatische Kunst (Helmholtz-Phelan 1907: 361). Schlegel\u2019s\nwritings made Shakespeare one of the most universally known and\nrevered authors, not only in Germany arguably in England too. In the\nend, however, Schlegel was quite pessimistic about the actual\ninfluence he had had in his time, and lamented that his efforts had\nfallen so far short of his desire to inspire an artistic movement and\ndefine an epoch.\n",
