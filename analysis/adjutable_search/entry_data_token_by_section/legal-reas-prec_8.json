    "main_text": "The Justifications for Precedent || Replicability\n3.3 Replicability\n\n\nThe preceding arguments for precedent presuppose that decision-makers\ncan correctly ascertain the merits of the cases before them, but law\nof course operates under non-ideal conditions where decision-makers\nmake mistakes and disagree among themselves about the merits of\ncases. In practice, the outcome of a case may be uncertain not simply\nbecause the correct result is rationally indeterminate, but because\nthe decision-makers are fallible.  Given this, a practice of precedent\nin law, it can be argued, has a number of advantages due the fact that\nit may make institutional decisions replicable (see Eisenberg\n1988, 10\u201312, 23\u20134, whose coinage it is; and Schauer 1987,\n597\u20138).  That a decision is replicable refers to the fact that\nit is possible for others to make an informed judgement on the\nlikelihood of a particular outcome, in the light of the relevant legal\nmaterials, the canons of reasoning used in a system, and an\nacquaintance with the general culture from which the decision-makers\nare drawn.  Replicability means that decisions are more predictable\nthan if they were made de novo each time. This, in turn,\nallows individuals to make plans that are consistent with the law and\nto avoid falling foul of it, and hence allows them to be guided by the\nlaw.\n\n\nThis provides a rationale both for treating earlier cases as\ncontributing to the law and for the doctrine of stare\ndecisis. Other things being equal, it is better if the law is\npredictable than if it is unpredictable. It should be noted, however,\nthat such a rationale does not necessarily support as strong a\ndoctrine of precedent as that found in many Common Law\njurisdictions. The concern for predictability needs to be weighed\nagainst the moral desirability of the law in question. This would\nsuggest that (a) in some circumstances lower courts should be allowed\nto depart from the decisions of higher courts where their view is that\nthe earlier decision was (in the context of the relevant law) clearly\nmorally undesirable, (b) giving greater freedom to courts to overrule\ntheir own decisions on the basis that there was a morally preferable\ndecision (in that legal context).\n",
