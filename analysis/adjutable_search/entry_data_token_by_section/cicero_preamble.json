    "main_text": "\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) is best known to posterity as\na prominent statesman and orator in the tumultuous period of the late\nRoman republic. As well as being a leading political actor of his\ntime, he also wrote voluminously. Among his writings, around a dozen\nphilosophical works have come down to us. Philosophy was a lifelong\npassion for Cicero. In addition to what one might call his strictly\nphilosophical compositions, much else of what he wrote \u2013\nincluding his speeches, works on rhetoric, and a large collection of\nletters \u2013 show evidence of his philosophical interests. In terms\nof modern scholarship, the value of Cicero\u2019s philosophical work\nwas held, until relatively recently, to lie chiefly in the information\nit provided about the thought of the leading philosophical schools of\nhis day: Stoicism, Epicureanism and Academic scepticism among them.\nHowever, in part because of the creative way in which he engages with\nhis predecessors, he is increasingly studied today as a philosophical\nthinker of independent interest.\n\nIn this entry, it is not possible to do more than offer a brief sketch\nof some of Cicero\u2019s main philosophical works and ideas. The\nfocus will be on providing a sense of the distinctiveness of his\nphilosophical approach, with particular attention paid to how his\nphilosophical allegiance and method of composition contribute to\nforming a conception of philosophy that remains worthy of notice.\n",
