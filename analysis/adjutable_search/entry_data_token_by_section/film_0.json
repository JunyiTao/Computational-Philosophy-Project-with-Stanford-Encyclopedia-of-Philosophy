    "main_text": "The Idea of a Philosophy of Film\n1. The Idea of a Philosophy of Film\n\n\nThere are two features of the philosophy of film that need to be\ndiscussed before delving into more specific issues. The first is that\nfilm scholars who are not professional philosophers have made many\ncontributions to the field. (See, for example, Chatman (1990)\nand Smith (1995).) This differentiates this area from many other\nphilosophical disciplines. While physicists often write about the\nphilosophy of science, the academic discipline of the philosophy of\nphysics is dominated by professional philosophers.  Not so in the\nphilosophy of film. As a result, my use of the term \u201cphilosopher\nof film\u201d will be broad, intended to include all of those\ninterested in theoretical issues about the cinema.\n\n\nThe second peculiarity is that within film studies\u2014itself an\ninstitutionalized area of academic study\u2014there is a sub-field\nof film theory that has significant overlap with the\nphilosophy of film even though the majority of its practitioners\noperate on significantly different philosophical assumptions than\nAnglo-American philosophers of film. In the balance of this entry, I\nshall include both of these areas under the rubric of the philosophy\nof film, although my primary emphasis is on the contributions of\nAnglo-American theorists and I will occasionally distinguish this\nfield from film theory as practiced within the area of film\nstudies. One of the characteristics of philosophy as a discipline is\nits questioning of its own nature and basis. The philosophy of film\nshares this characteristic with the field in general. Indeed, a first\nissue that the philosophy of film must address is the grounds for its\nown existence. This involves not only the question of what the field\nshould look like, but also that of whether it has any reason to exist\nat all. \n\n\nIs there any need for a separate philosophic discipline devoted to\nfilm in addition to more empirical studies of film undertaken under\nthe aegis of film studies itself?  Although this question has not\nalways received the attention it deserves from philosophers, it is\nactually a pressing one, for it asks philosophers to justify their\nnewly found interest in film as more than an opportunistic\nincorporation of a highly popular form of popular culture into their\ndomain.\n\n\nIn one sense, however, philosophers need not justify their interest in\nfilm, for philosophical aesthetics has always had a concern not just\nwith art in general but with specific art forms. Beginning with\nAristotle's Poetics\u2014a work devoted to explaining the\nnature of Greek tragedy\u2014philosophers have sought to explain\nthe specific characteristics of each significant art form of their\nculture. From this point of view, there is no more reason to question\nthe existence of a philosophy of film than there is that of a\nphilosophy of music or a philosophy of painting, two fields that are\nwell accepted as components of aesthetics. Since film is a\nsignificant artform in our contemporary world, philosophy might even\nbe judged to have a responsibility to investigate its nature.\n\n\nStill, there are some reasons why it might seem problematic for there\nto be a separate academic field of the philosophy of film.  Because\nthe study of film is already institutionalized within academia in the\ndiscipline of film studies, and because that field includes a separate\nsub-field of film theory, it might seem that, unlike literature and\nmusic, say, film is already well-served by this institutional\nbase. From this point of view, the philosophy of film is redundant,\noccupying a space that has already been carved out by an alternative\ndiscipline.\n\n\nThe problem is that the sub-field of film theory within film studies\nhas been dominated by a range of theoretical commitments that many\nAnglo-American philosophers do not share. Many such philosophers have\ntherefore felt a need not just to make minor revisions in the field\nand its understanding of film but rather to make a new beginning in\nthe study of film that does not share the problematic assumptions of\nfilm theory itself. For this reason, as well as the earlier-cited view\nof film as a legitimate topic within aesthetics, they have felt it\nimportant to develop a philosophically informed mode of thinking about\nfilm.\n\n\nBut once the philosophy of film is granted autonomy as a separate\nsub-field of aesthetics, the question arises as to its form. That is,\nphilosophers are concerned with the issue of how the philosophy of\nfilm should be constituted as a field of study. What role is there for\nfilm interpretation in the field?  How do studies of particular films\nrelate to more theoretical studies of the medium as such?  And what\nabout philosophy in film, a popular mode of philosophic\nthinking about film?  Is there a unified model that can be employed to\ncharacterize this newly vitalized domain of philosophic inquiry?\n\n\nAn increasingly popular way of thinking about the philosophy of film\nis to model it on scientific theorizing. Although there is\ndisagreement on the precise details of such a proposal, its adherents\nurge that the study of film be treated as a scientific discipline with\nan appropriate relationship between theory and evidence. For some,\nthis means having an empirical body of film interpretations that gives\nrise to wider theoretical generalizations. For others, it means\ndeveloping a set of small scale theories that attempt to explain\ndifferent aspect of films and our experience of them. The emphasis\nhere is on developing models or theories of various\nfeatures of films.\n\n\nThis idea of modeling the discipline of the philosophy of film on the\nnatural sciences has been prominent among cognitive film\ntheorists (Bordwell and Carroll 1996; Currie 1995). This rapidly\ndeveloping approach emphasizes viewers' conscious processing of films,\nas opposed to the emphasis within traditional film theory on\nunconscious processes. In general, these theorists lean towards seeing\nthe study of film as a scientific undertaking.\n\n\nThe idea that the philosophy of film should model itself upon a\nscientific model has been contested from a variety of points of\nview. Some philosophers, relying on the writings of pragmatists like\nWilliam James, have questioned the idea that natural science provides\na useful way to think about what philosophers are doing in their\nreflections on film. Here, there is an emphasis on the particularity\nof films as works of art in contrast the to the urge to move to a\ngeneral theory of film. Others, making use of later Wittgenstein as\nwell as the tradition of hermeneutics, also question such a natural\nscientific orientation for philosophic reflections on film. This camp\nsees the study of film as a humanistic discipline that is\nmisunderstood when it is assimilated to a natural science.\n\n\nThe debates about what the philosophy of film should look like are\nreally just being joined. This is because it is only recently that a\nscientific conception of the philosophy of film has emerged as a\ncompetitor. But despite the increasing popularity of a cognitive\napproach to film, there are fundamental issues about the structure of\nthe philosophy of film that remain to be settled.\n\n\nOne fundamental issue is what mediums are to be included under the\nterm \"film.\"  Although \"film\" initially referred to the celluloid\nstock on which movies were recorded, restricting the term to just\ncelluloid-based works would be unduly restrictive.  After all, many of\nthe films we watch today are either recorded digitally or projected\ndigitally or both.  Such works are clearly part of the same art form\nas celluloid-based films, so the referent of the term \"film\" has to be\ntaken to include works made on both mediums.\n\n\nAnd then is television.  Although many film scholars and philosophers\nof film has a disparaging view of television, the emergence of such\nshows as The Sopranos and The Wire established\ntelevision as a medium for making valuable works of art.  As a result,\nit makes sense to include such shows under the rubric of films.\n\n\nThis stretching of the concept \"film\" to include both non-celluloid\nmovies and television and other related mediums has led some\nphilosophers of film to suggest replacing the term \"film\" with a\nbroader category, such as moving picture or moving image.  So far,\nsuch suggestions have not yet changed the way in which the field is\ndesignated, so I retain the term \"philosophy of film\" throughout this\nentry.\n",
