    "main_text": "\n\nDescartes is not well known for his contributions to ethics. Some have\ncharged that it is a weakness of his philosophy that it focuses\nexclusively on metaphysics and epistemology to the exclusion of moral\nand political philosophy. Such criticisms rest on a misunderstanding\nof the broader framework of Descartes\u2019 philosophy. Evidence of\nDescartes\u2019 concern for the practical import of philosophy can be\ntraced to his earliest writings. In agreement with the ancients, he\nidentifies the goal of philosophy with the attainment of a wisdom that\nis sufficient for happiness. The details of this position are\ndeveloped most fully in writings from the latter part of\nDescartes\u2019 career: his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth,\nThe Passions of the Soul, and the preface to the French\ntranslation of the Principles of Philosophy, where he\npresents his famous image of the tree of philosophy, whose uppermost\nbranch is \u201cthe highest and most perfect moral system, which\npresupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is the\nultimate level of wisdom.\u201d\n",
