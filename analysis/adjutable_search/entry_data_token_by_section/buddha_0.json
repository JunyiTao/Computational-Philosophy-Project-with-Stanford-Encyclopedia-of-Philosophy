    "main_text": "Buddha as Philosopher\n1. Buddha as Philosopher\n\nThis entry concerns the historical individual, traditionally called\nGautama, who is identified by modern scholars as the founder of\nBuddhism. According to Buddhist teachings, there have been other\nbuddhas in the past, and there will be yet more in the future. The\ntitle \u2018Buddha\u2019, which literally means\n\u2018awakened\u2019, is conferred on an individual who discovers\nthe path to nirvana, the cessation of suffering, and propagates that\ndiscovery so that others may also achieve nirvana. This entry\nwill follow modern scholarship in taking an agnostic stance on the\nquestion of whether there have been other buddhas, and likewise for\nquestions concerning the superhuman status and powers that some\nBuddhists attribute to buddhas. The concern of this entry is just\nthose aspects of the thought of the historical individual Gautama that\nbear on the development of the Buddhist philosophical tradition.\n\nThe Buddha will here be treated as a philosopher. To so treat him is\ncontroversial, but before coming to why that should be so, let us\nfirst rehearse those basic aspects of the Buddha\u2019s life and\nteachings that are relatively non-controversial. Tradition has it that\nGautama lived to age 80. Up until recently his dates were thought to\nbe approximately 560\u2013480 BCE, but many scholars now hold that he\nmust have died around 405 BCE. He was born into a family of some\nwealth and power, members of the \u015a\u0101kya clan, in the area of\nthe present border between India and Nepal. The story is that in early\nadulthood he abandoned his comfortable life as a householder (as well\nas his wife and young son) in order to seek a solution to the problem\nof existential suffering. He first took up with a number of different\nwandering ascetics (\u015bramanas) who claimed to know the\npath to liberation from suffering. Finding their teachings\nunsatisfactory, he struck out on his own, and through a combination of\ninsight and meditational practice attained the state of enlightenment\n(bodhi) which is said to represent the cessation of all\nfurther suffering. He then devoted the remaining 45 years of his life\nto teaching others the insights and techniques that had led him to\nthis achievement.\n\nGautama could himself be classified as one of the\n\u015bramanas. That there existed such a phenomenon as the\n\u015bramanas tells us that there was some degree of\ndissatisfaction with the customary religious practices then prevailing\nin the Gangetic basin of North India. These practices consisted\nlargely in the rituals and sacrifices prescribed in the Vedas. Among\nthe \u015bramanas there were many, including the Buddha, who\nrejected the authority of the Vedas as definitive pronouncements on\nthe nature of the world and our place in it (and for this reason are\ncalled \u2018heterodox\u2019). But within the Vedic canon itself\nthere is a stratum of (comparatively late) texts, the\nUpani\u1e63ads, that likewise displays disaffection with\nBrahmin ritualism. Among the new ideas that figure in these\n(\u2018orthodox\u2019) texts, as well as in the teachings of those\nheterodox \u015bramanas whose doctrines are known to us, are\nthe following: that sentient beings (including humans, non-human\nanimals, gods, and the inhabitants of various hells) undergo rebirth;\nthat rebirth is governed by the causal laws of karma (good actions\ncause pleasant fruit for the agent, evil actions cause unpleasant\nfruit, etc.); that continual rebirth is inherently unsatisfactory;\nthat there is an ideal state for sentient beings involving liberation\nfrom the cycle of rebirth; and that attaining this state requires\novercoming ignorance concerning one\u2019s true identity. Various\nviews are offered concerning this ignorance and how to overcome it.\nThe Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 (classified by some orthodox\nschools as an Upani\u1e63ad) lists four such methods, and\ndiscusses at least two separate views concerning our identity: that\nthere is a plurality of distinct selves, each being the true agent of\na person\u2019s actions and the bearer of karmic merit and demerit\nbut existing separately from the body and its associated states; and\nthat there is just one self, of the nature of pure consciousness (a\n\u2018witness\u2019) and identical with the essence of the cosmos,\nBrahman or pure undifferentiated Being.\n\nThe Buddha agreed with those of his contemporaries embarked on the\nsame soteriological project that it is ignorance about our identity\nthat is responsible for suffering. What sets his teachings apart (at\nthis level of analysis) lies in what he says that ignorance consists\nin: the conceit that there is an \u2018I\u2019 and a\n\u2018mine\u2019. This is the famous Buddhist teaching of non-self\n(an\u0101tman). And it is with this teaching that the\ncontroversy begins concerning whether Gautama may legitimately be\nrepresented as a philosopher. First there are those (e.g. Albahari\n2006) who (correctly) point out that the Buddha never categorically\ndenies the existence of a self that transcends what is empirically\ngiven, namely the five skandhas or psychophysical elements.\nWhile the Buddha does deny that any of the psychophysical elements is\na self, these interpreters claim that he at least leaves open the\npossibility that there is a self that is transcendent in the sense of\nbeing non-empirical. To this it may be objected that all of classical\nIndian philosophy\u2014Buddhist and orthodox alike\u2014understood\nthe Buddha to have denied the self tout court. To this it is\nsometimes replied that the later philosophical tradition simply got\nthe Buddha wrong, at least in part because the Buddha sought to\nindicate something that cannot be grasped through the exercise of\nphilosophical rationality. On this interpretation, the Buddha should\nbe seen not as a proponent of the philosophical methods of analysis\nand argumentation, but rather as one who sees those methods as\nobstacles to final release.\n\nAnother reason one sometimes encounters for denying that the Buddha is\na philosopher is that he rejects the characteristically philosophical\nactivity of theorizing about matters that lack evident practical\napplication. On this interpretation as well, those later Buddhist\nthinkers who did go in for the construction of theories about the\nultimate nature of everything simply failed to heed or properly\nappreciate the Buddha\u2019s advice that we avoid theorizing for its\nown sake and confine our attention to those matters that are directly\nrelevant to liberation from suffering. On this view the teaching of\nnon-self is not a bit of metaphysics, just some practical advice to\nthe effect that we should avoid identifying with things that are\ntransitory and so bound to yield dissatisfaction. What both\ninterpretations share is the assumption that it is possible to arrive\nat what the Buddha himself thought without relying on the\nunderstanding of his teachings developed in the subsequent Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition.\n\nThis assumption may be questioned. Our knowledge of the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings comes by way of texts that were not written down until\nseveral centuries after his death, are in languages (P\u0101li, and\nChinese translations of Sanskrit) other than the one he is likely to\nhave spoken, and disagree in important respects. The first difficulty\nmay not be as serious as it seems, given that the Buddha\u2019s\ndiscourses were probably rehearsed shortly after his death and\npreserved through oral transmission until the time they were committed\nto writing. And the second need not be insuperable either. (See, e.g.,\nCousins 2022.) But the third is troubling, in that it suggests\ntextual transmission involved processes of insertion and deletion in\naid of one side or another in sectarian disputes. Our ancient sources\nattest to this: one will encounter a dispute among Buddhist thinkers\nwhere one side cites some utterance of the Buddha in support of their\nposition, only to have the other side respond that the text from which\nthe quotation is taken is not universally recognized as\nauthoritatively the word of the Buddha. This suggests that our record\nof the Buddha\u2019s teaching may be colored by the philosophical\nelaboration of those teachings propounded by later thinkers in the\nBuddhist tradition.\n\nSome scholars (e.g., Gombrich 2009, Shulman 2014) are more sanguine\nthan others about the possibility of overcoming this difficulty, and\nthereby getting at what the Buddha himself had thought, as opposed to\nwhat later Buddhist philosophers thought he had thought. No position\nwill be taken on this dispute here. We will be treating the\nBuddha\u2019s thought as it was understood within the later\nphilosophical tradition that he had inspired. The resulting\ninterpretation may or may not be faithful to his intentions. It is at\nleast logically possible that he believed there to be a transcendent\nself that can only be known by mystical intuition, or that the\nexercise of philosophical rationality leads only to sterile theorizing\nand away from real emancipation. What we can say with some assurance\nis that this is not how the Buddhist philosophical tradition\nunderstood him. It is their understanding that will be the subject of\nthis essay.\n",
