    "main_text": "Epicurus and the Harm Thesis\n3. Epicurus and the Harm Thesis\n\nIs death bad for some people who die? Is it good for some of them?\n\nAccording to the harm thesis, death is, at least sometimes,\nbad for those who die, and in this sense something that\n\u2018harms\u2019 them. It is important to know what to make of this\nthesis, since our response itself can be harmful. This might happen as\nfollows: suppose that we love life, and reason that since it is good,\nmore would be better. Our thoughts then turn to death, and we decide\nit is bad: the better life is, we think, the better more life would\nbe, and the worse death is. At this point, we are in danger of\ncondemning the human condition, which embraces life and death, on the\ngrounds that it has a tragic side, namely death. It will help some if\nwe remind ourselves that our situation also has a good side. Indeed,\nour condemnation of death is here based on the assumption that more\nlife would be good. But such consolations are not for everyone. (They\nare unavailable if we crave immortality on the basis of demanding\nstandards by which the only worthwhile projects are endless in\nduration, for then we will condemn the condition of mere mortals as\ntragic through and through, and may, as Unamuno (1913) points out, end\nup suicidal, fearing that the only life available is not worth\nhaving.) And a favorable assessment of life may be a limited\nconsolation, since it leaves open the possibility that, viewing the\nhuman condition as a whole, the bad cancels much of the good. In any\ncase it is grim enough to conclude that, given the harm thesis, the\nhuman condition has a tragic side.\n\nIt is no wonder that theorists over the millennia have sought to\ndefeat the harm thesis. Let us consider some challenges to the harm\nthesis, beginning with the case against it developed by the ancient\nGreek philosopher Epicurus.\n",
