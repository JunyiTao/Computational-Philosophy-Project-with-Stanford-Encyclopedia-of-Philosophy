    "main_text": "Sources || Plato and Aristotle as Sources for Pythagoras\n2.3 Plato and Aristotle as Sources for Pythagoras\n\n\nIn reconstructing the thought of early Greek philosophers, scholars\noften turn to Aristotle\u2019s and Plato\u2019s accounts of their predecessors,\nalthough Plato\u2019s accounts are embedded in the literary structure of\nhis dialogues and thus do not pretend to historical accuracy, while\nAristotle\u2019s apparently more historical presentation masks a\nconsiderable amount of reinterpretation of his predecessors\u2019 views in\nterms of his own thought. In the case of Pythagoras, what is striking\nis the essential agreement of Plato and Aristotle in their\npresentation of his significance. Aristotle frequently discusses the\nphilosophy of Pythagoreans, whom he dates to the middle and second\nhalf of the fifth century and who posited limiters and unlimiteds as\nfirst principles. He sometimes refers to these Pythagoreans as the\n\u201cso-called Pythagoreans,\u201d suggesting that he had some\nreservations about the application of the label\n\u201cPythagorean\u201d to them. Aristotle strikingly may never\nrefer to Pythagoras himself in his extant writings\n(Metaph. 986a29 is probably an interpolation; Rh.\n1398b14 is a quotation from Alcidamas; MM 1182a11 may not be\nby Aristotle and, if it is, may well be a case where\n\u201cPythagoreans\u201d have been turned into\n\u201cPythagoras\u201d in the transmission). In the fragments of his\nnow lost two-book treatise on the Pythagoreans, Aristotle does discuss\nPythagoras himself, but the references are all to Pythagoras as a\nfounder of a way of life, who forbade the eating of beans (Fr. 195),\nand to Pythagoras as a wonder-worker, who had a golden thigh and bit a\nsnake to death (Fr. 191). Zhmud (2012a, 259\u2013260) argues that in one\nplace Aristotle also describes Pythagoras as a mathematician (Fr. 191)\nand in another as studying nature (Protrepticus Fr. 20) but in neither\ncase are the words likely to belong to Aristotle (see Huffman 2014b,\n281, n.7). If Aristotle only found evidence for Pythagoras as a\nwonder-worker and founder of a way of life, it becomes clear why he\nnever mentions Pythagoras in his account of his philosophical\npredecessors and why he uses the expression \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans\u201d to refer to the Pythagoreanism of the\nfifth-century. For Aristotle Pythagoras did not belong to the\nsuccession of thinkers starting with Thales, who were attempting to\nexplain the basic principles of the natural world, and hence he could\nnot see what sense it made to call a fifth-century thinker like\nPhilolaus, who joined that succession by positing limiters and\nunlimiteds as first principles, a Pythagorean. Plato is often thought\nto be heavily indebted to the Pythagoreans, but he is almost as\nparsimonious in his references to Pythagoras as Aristotle and mentions\nhim only once in his writings. Plato\u2019s one reference to Pythagoras\n(R. 600a) treats him as the founder of a way of life, just as\nAristotle does, and, when Plato traces the history of philosophy prior\nto his time in the Sophist, (242c-e), there is no allusion to\nPythagoras. In the Philebus, Plato does describe the\nphilosophy of limiters and unlimiteds, which Aristotle assigns to the\nso-called Pythagoreans of the fifth century and which is found in the\nfragments of Philolaus, but like Aristotle he does not ascribe this\nphilosophy to Pythagoras himself. Scholars, both ancient and modern,\nunder the influence of the later glorification of Pythagoras, have\nsupposed that the Prometheus, whom Plato describes as hurling the\nsystem down to men, was Pythagoras (e.g., Kahn 2002: 13\u201314), but\ncareful reading of the passage shows that Prometheus is just\nPrometheus and that Plato, like Aristotle, assigns the philosophical\nsystem to a group of men (Huffman 1999a, 2001). The fragments of\nPhilolaus show that he was the primary figure of this group. When\nPlato refers to Philolaus in the Phaedo (61d-e), he does not\nidentify him as a Pythagorean, so that once again Plato agrees with\nAristotle in distancing the \u201cso-called Pythagoreans\u201d of\nthe fifth century from Pythagoras himself.  For both Plato and\nAristotle, then, Pythagoras is not a part of the cosmological and\nmetaphysical tradition of Presocratic philosophy nor is he closely\nconnected to the metaphysical system presented by fifth-century\nPythagoreans like Philolaus; he is instead the founder of a way of\nlife.\n",
