    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || Conceptual Constructivism\n4.4 Conceptual Constructivism\n\n\u201cConceptual constructivism\u201d, as we could call it, is among\nthe empiricist alternatives to the argument view. The position has\nbeen taken up by Van Dyck (2003) to account especially for\nHeisenberg\u2019s \u0263-ray microscope; but also by Gendler (1998)\nto makes sense of Galileo\u2019s falling body thought experiment.\nGendler\u2019s proposal was advanced in more general terms by\nCamilleri (2014) in order to establish a firm middle ground between\nthe views of Norton and Brown. Conceptual constructivism was first\nproposed by Thomas Kuhn (1964). He employs many of the concepts (but\nnot the terminology) of his well-known Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions. On his view a well-conceived thought experiment can\nbring on a crisis or at least create an anomaly in the reigning theory\nand so contribute to paradigm change. Thought experiments can teach us\nsomething new about the world, even though we have no new empirical\ndata, by helping us to re-conceptualize the world in a new way.\nAccordingly, some have entertained the option of conceptual\nconstructivism in the form of a Neo-Kantian reading of\nEinstein\u2019s famous clock in the box thought experiment. Such an\napproach is inspired by Michael Friedman\u2019s proposal to conceive\nof scientific revolutions as times when a Kantian kind of natural\nphilosophy plays a major role in guiding scientists from one paradigm\nto another. The work of Kuhn left us with a puzzle: if scientific\nrationality is absolutely dependent on a paradigm, and if during\nscientific revolutions one paradigm replaces another, not in degrees\nbut absolutely, comparable to a \u201cGestalt\u201d switch, then\nthis transition from one paradigm to the next cannot be a matter of\nscientific rationality. Are scientific revolutions irrational periods\nin the history of science? Not necessarily; some kind of natural\nphilosophy may guide the process. Friedman has a Kantian natural\nphilosophy in mind; his proposal did not earn wide acceptance, but the\nproblem remains (see Fisch 2017). Be that as it may, it is true that\nthought experiments are a valuable currency in times of scientific\nrevolution. For example, Lennox (1991) has argued that the revolution\nbrought about by Charles Darwin in 1859 was made possible by thought\nexperiments (among other things, of course).\n",
