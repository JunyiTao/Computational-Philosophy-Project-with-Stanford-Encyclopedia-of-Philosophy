    "main_text": "The Wrongs and Harms of Rape || Rape and racism\n3.3 Rape and racism\n\nRape is a tool not only of patriarchy, but also of racism,\ncolonialism, nationalism, and other pernicious hierarchies. These and\nother power relationships in turn make women and girls even more\nvulnerable to rape. In virtually any situation where women and girls\nbelonging to especially desperate or powerless populations are at the\nmercy of men in authority\u2014from female inmates and girls in\nfoster care, to undocumented immigrants, to refugees dependent on U.N.\npeacekeepers and/or humanitarian aid workers for survival\u2014some\nof those men use their authority to force or extort sexual access.\n\nIn the United States, the racial dynamics of rape are shaped by a long\nhistory of white men raping their African-American female slaves.\nBecause the women were chattel property, the owners (and often\noverseers) could and did use them sexually at will, with complete\nlegal and social impunity. Because children born of slave mothers were\nslaves, regardless of their paternity, many slave owners benefited\nfrom rape by producing more slaves for themselves. Roberts emphasizes,\nhowever, that\n\nthe rape of slave women by their masters was primarily a weapon of\nterror that reinforced whites\u2019 domination over their human\nproperty. Rape was an act of physical violence designed to stifle\nBlack women\u2019s will to resist and to remind them of their servile\nstatus \u2026 . Whites\u2019 sexual exploitation of their slaves,\ntherefore, should not be viewed simply as either a method of\nslave-breeding or the fulfillment of slaveholders\u2019 sexual urges.\n(1997, 29-30)\n\n\nSlaves were frequently forced into undesired sexual liaisons with each\nother as well, based on the whims or the breeding plans of their\nowners. Ultimately, as Collins observes, \u201cBlack women as a class\nemerged from slavery as collective rape victims\u201d (2005, 223),\nand the rape of black women, like the lynching of black men, was a\ncenterpiece of Klan activity post-Emancipation. Collins points out,\nhowever, that unlike lynching, black women\u2019s sexual abuse by\nwhite men during and after slavery did not become a central or\nuniversally understood icon of American racism. The legacy of slavery\nand its attendant ideologies has meant that, both legally and\nsocially, \u201cfor most of American history the crime of rape of a\nBlack woman did not exist\u201d (Roberts 1997, 31).\n\nBlack women\u2019s unrapeability was not only written into law, but\nreinforced by a racial ideology that defined them as lascivious and\npromiscuous by nature. This same racial ideology stereotyped black men\nas savagely oversexed and thus sexually dangerous, especially to white\nwomen. The post-Civil War terror campaign of lynching, which continued\nthrough the 1930\u2019s, was frequently claimed to be punishment for\nblack men who had raped white women, although in fact only a minority\nof lynching victims were even accused of having done any such thing\n(Hall 1983, 334; Davis 1981, 189), and of those, many had in fact had\nconsensual relationships with white women (Hall 1983, 340). The racist\nassociation of rape with black men rendered rape by white men\ncomparatively invisible, thus making white men as a group\nunaccountable for rape (Davis 1981, 199), a dynamic that continued\nwell into the 20th century (Dorr 2008).\n\nThese destructive racial stereotypes remain powerful today, exerting\ninfluence on people\u2019s judgments of whether a rape has occurred,\nhow serious an offense it is, and who is to blame (Foley et al. 1995;\nDonovan and Williams 2002; George and Martinez 2002). Popular culture\nplays an important role in conveying and legitimizing these\nstereotypes. For instance, the image of sexually savage and\nanimalistic black masculinity is a central trope of the popular\n\u201cinterracial\u201d genre of pornography, marketed to white men,\nin which black men are often depicted as damaging white women\u2019s\nbodies with their unusually large penises (Dines 1998, 2006). As\nCollins observes, \u201cmovies, films, music videos, and other mass\nmedia spectacles that depict Black men as violent and that punish them\nfor it have replaced the historical spectacles provided by live,\npublic lynchings\u201d (2005, 242).\n\nThe stereotype of black women as sexually deviant and aggressive\n\u201cJezebels\u201d finds one contemporary reflection in the\n\u201choochie\u201d image, which is increasingly prominent in black\nas well as white cultural and media venues (Collins 2000,\n81\u201384). One study, designed in part to measure the influence of\nthe Jezebel stereotype on young black women\u2019s perceptions of\ntheir own rapes, found that the \u201cstereotype of Black women as\nsexually loose appeared to be internalized by Black participants and\nidentified as an important reason why they were raped\u201d (Neville\net al. 2004, 91). Another researcher, having found that the\nAfrican-American women in her study were less likely than white women\nto have disclosed their rapes (Wyatt 1992, 86), attributes this\ndifference in part to the fact that \u201cAfrican American women\n\u2026. do not anticipate that they will be protected by traditional\nauthorities and institutions\u201d (88). Meanwhile, both the\nstereotypes of black women and their structural vulnerabilities\ncontribute to a situation in which, for too many, sexual abuse is a\nroutine condition of life: \u201cbeing routinely disbelieved by those\nwho control the definitions of violence, encountering mass media\nrepresentations that depict Black women as \u2018bitches,\u2019\n\u2018hoes,\u2019 and other controlling images, and/or experiencing\ndaily assaults such as having their breasts and buttocks fondled by\nfriends and perfect strangers \u2026 may become so routine that\nAfrican American women cannot perceive their own pain\u201d (Collins\n2005, 229).\n\nBlack women who have been raped by black men are sometimes silenced,\neither in order to maintain their own hard-won image as\n\u201crespectable\u201d or to avoid further tarnishing the public\nimage of black manhood. They may be penalized or shunned by their\nfamilies and communities for speaking out, and thus cut off from\nimportant sources of support (Collins 2005, 226-27).\n\nRacist ideologies about rape are also prominent in the history of\ncolonialism and genocide against Native Americans. Ideas about Native\nmen as savage rapists, Native women as downtrodden and raped squaws,\nand white men as heroic saviors of both white and Native women were\nessential to the \u201ccolonial imagination\u201d that explained and\njustified the taking of Native lands (Smith 2005, 7\u201333). These\nideas were conveyed in widely read captivity narratives,\nstories\u2014usually apocryphal, and often written by white\nmen\u2014of the abduction and brutal treatment of a white woman by\nthe \u201csavages\u201d (Smith 2005, 21\u201322; Faludi 2007,\n200\u2013279). The message was that white women desperately needed\nwhite men\u2019s protection, not only in the usual form of\nrestrictions on the women\u2019s behavior and mobility, but also by\nthe men\u2019s efforts to control and kill off dangerous natives. As\nfor supposedly downtrodden Native women, white men proposed to deliver\nthem from their oppression by civilizing them, assimilating them to\nmore enlightened European values and culture. In short, the ideology\nheld that \u201cNative women can only be free while under the\ndominion of white men, and both Native and white women have to be\nprotected from Indian men, rather than from white men\u201d (Smith,\n23). In fact, the reality was quite the contrary. Smith argues that\nrape was a key method of forcibly instituting patriarchal values in\nwhat had been relatively egalitarian Native cultures:\n\nIn order to colonize a people whose society was not hierarchical,\ncolonizers must first naturalize hierarchy through instituting\npatriarchy. Patriarchal gender violence is the process by which\ncolonizers inscribe hierarchy and domination on the bodies of the\ncolonized. (23)\n\n\nHistory bears out Smith\u2019s claim, as white men routinely raped\nand brutalized Native people\u2014first as prisoners and in massacres\n(Smith 2005, 7\u201323), and later in epidemic levels of sexual abuse\nof Native children in white-run boarding schools (Smith 2006).\n",
