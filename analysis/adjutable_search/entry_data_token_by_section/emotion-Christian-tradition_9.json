Criteriological work on religious emotions\n\nIn a book that Kierkegaard didn\u2019t publish but rewrote many times\n(On Authority and Revelation), he reflected about the case of\na Hegelian pastor, a certain Adolph Peter Adler, who claimed to have\nhad a revelation from Jesus Christ. By comparison with most of his\ncontemporaries in the Danish Lutheran Church, Adler was a man of\nstrong religious passion / feeling, and Kierkegaard respected him for\nthat. But he also noted that Adler\u2019s religious emotion was entirely\ngeneric, having no just claim to be especially Christian. Adler\u2019s\nemotion was not Christian emotion because it did not show the\ndistinctive conceptual marks.\n\n\u2026it was Magister Adler\u2019s advantage that he was deeply moved,\nshaken in his inmost being\u2026. But to be thus profoundly moved is\na very indefinite expression for something so concrete as Christian\nawakening or conversion \u2026 emotion (Grebethed) which is\nChristian is checked by the definition of concepts \u2026 to express\noneself Christianly there is required, besides the more universal\nlanguage of the heart, also skill and schooling in the definition of\nChristian concepts, while at the same time\u2026the emotion is of a\nspecific, qualitative sort, the Christian emotion (pp. 163, 164).\n\n\nKierkegaard goes on to point out that using the distinctively\nChristian terms is no guarantee that the emotions themselves will\ndisplay the Christian conceptual structure, because such terms as\n\u2018sin,\u2019 \u2018redemption,\u2019\n\u2018forgiveness,\u2019 and \u2018Holy Spirit,\u2019 have\n\u201cbecome in a volatilized sense the conversational language of\nthe whole of Europe\u201d (p. 166). In other words, the terms are\nused in a different sense from the one they have in original\nChristianity, because they have been dissociated from Christian\nthought and practice.\n\nA major aim of Kierkegaard\u2019s writings as a philosopher (or\n\u201cdialectician\u201d as he usually describes himself) is to\noffer analyses of emotion concepts (which are at the same time virtue\nconcepts) that can function in a regulative or criteriological way.\nThat is, they specify the conceptual shape of these emotions when they\nare authentically Christian. The analyses are written in a richly\nliterary way (for besides being a \u201cdialectician,\u201d\nKierkegaard is, as he says, a \u201cpoet\u201d), and this is\nimportant for Kierkegaard\u2019s regulative purpose, since he aims not just\nto inform people about the logic of religious emotions, but to move\nthem to see the world in their terms and to take action in their\nterms. Examples of such emotion-regulative discourse are the\nfollowing: Works of Love about the virtue of love; \u201cThe\nExpectancy of Faith\u201d, \u201cPatience in Expectancy\u201d, and\n\u201cThe Expectancy of an Eternal Salvation\u201d, all about the\nvirtue of hope and found in Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses;\n\u201cEvery Good and Every Perfect Gift Is from Above\u201d and\n\u201cOne Who Prays Aright Struggles in Prayer and Is Victorious\n\u2014 in That God Is Victorious\u201d about the virtue of gratitude\nand also in Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses; \u201cOn the\nOccasion of a Confession: Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing\u201d\nabout contrition and found in Upbuilding Discourses in Various\nSpirits; and the discourses in Part Three of the same book, which\nare all about joy. These are just a few of many examples of religious\nemotion-regulative thought in Kierkegaard\u2019s writings.\n\nAnother well-known author whose work on religious emotions is\nregulative is Jonathan Edwards. In A Treatise Concerning Religious\nAffections, Edwards aims to correct both a passionless\nChristianity and a revivalist \u201centhusiasm\u201d that confuses\nemotional intensity with the work of the Holy Spirit. Edwards begins\nby discussing the nature and importance of emotions in the Christian\nlife, and then turns to a systematic treatment of twenty-four supposed\n\u201csigns\u201d or criteria for the genuineness of religious\nemotions. The first twelve signs turn out not to be genuine criteria:\nThey do not rule out the emotion\u2019s being a work of the Spirit, but\nneither are they specific marks of it. Thus, for example, a person\u2019s\nemotions in a revival meeting might be extremely intense (sign 1), or\nattended by great bodily perturbations (sign 2), or might dispose the\nsubject to talk volubly about religion (sign 3), but these marks show\nnothing one way or the other about the Christian character of the\naffection.\n\nEdwards then turns to the twelve signs that do indicate the gracious\nwork of the Spirit in the believer\u2019s life. Sign 5 is that one\u2019s\nemotions involve an immediate conviction that the great things of the\ngospel are true, and sign 6, \u201cevangelical humiliation,\u201d is\na strong disinclination to judge oneself better than others or to\nbelieve that one\u2019s spiritual attainments entitle one to some claim on\nGod. Sign 12 is Christian practice: affections that dissipate\nthemselves in excitement and feelings without leading to Christian\naction are bogus; genuine spiritual affections motivate characteristic\nChristian action. Sign 7 is that such action is persistent: genuine\nspiritual affections signal a lasting change of character. Edwards\nendorses the signs not as criteria by which to discern how well one\u2019s\nneighbor measures up in the kingdom of God, but as criteria to be used\nin self-examination and self-discipline.\n\nKierkegaard and Edwards agree that religious emotions are diverse,\nthat they embody religious teachings, that they are important\nepistemic and ethical indicators of character, and that in consequence\nthere are conceptual criteria for their rightness that can and should\nbe carefully clarified.\n7. Conclusion\n\nJames seems to be right in claiming that there is no\nemotion type that is distinctive of religion as such. Religious\nemotions come in the usual types \u2014 contrition, gratitude, joy,\nfear, anxiety, anger, and so forth \u2014 and what makes them\ndistinctive of one religion or another is their shaping by the\nteachings of the religion about God or the transcendent. Emotions are\nimportant to adherents of a religion because, like the actions that\nthey sometimes motivate, they are expressions of the moral and\nspiritual life enjoined by the religion. They constitute an important\npart of the substance of the religious life. For this reason, teachers\nof the religion, as guardians and regulators of the life in question,\nsometimes formulate criteria of genuineness of religious emotions.",
