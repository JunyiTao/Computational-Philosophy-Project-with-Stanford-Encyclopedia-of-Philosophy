Providing a ranking of the candidates is much more\nexpressive than simply selecting a single candidate. However,\nranking all of the candidates can be very demanding,\nespecially when there is a large number of them, since it can be\ndifficult for voters to make distinctions between all the\ncandidates. The most well-known example of a voting method that uses\nthe voters\u2019 rankings is Borda Count: \n\nBorda Count:\n\nEach voter provides a ranking of the candidates. Then, a score (the\nBorda score) is assigned to each candidate by a voter as follows: If\nthere are \\(n\\) candidates, give \\(n-1\\) points to the candidate ranked\nfirst, \\(n-2\\) points to the candidate ranked second,\u2026, 1 point to\nthe candidate ranked second to last and 0 points to candidate ranked\nlast. So, the Borda score of candidate \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\BS(A)\\), is\ncalculated as follows (where \\(\\#U\\) denotes the number elements in\nthe set \\(U)\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\BS(A) =\\ &(n-1)\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) first}\\}\\\\\n  &+ (n-2)\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) second}\\} \\\\\n  &+ \\cdots \\\\\n  &+ 1\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) second to last}\\}\\\\\n  &+ 0\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) last}\\} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\nThe candidate with the highest Borda score wins.\n\n\nRecall the example discussed in the introduction to Section 1. For\neach alternative, the Borda scores can be calculated using the above\nmethod: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\BS(A) &= 3 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 13 = 24 \\\\\n\\BS(B) &= 3 \\times 7 + 2 \\times 9 + 1 \\times 5 + 0 \\times 0 = 44  \\\\\n\\BS(C) &= 3 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 5 + 1 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 0 = 38 \\\\\n\\BS(D) &= 3 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 7 + 1 \\times 6 + 0 \\times 8 = 20 \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBorda Count is an example of a scoring rule. A scoring rule is\nany method that calculates a score based on weights assigned to\ncandidates according to where they fall in the voters\u2019 rankings. That\nis, a scoring rule for \\(n\\) candidates is defined as follows: Fix a\nsequence of numbers \\((s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n)\\) where \\(s_k\\ge\ns_{k+1}\\) for all \\(k=1,\\ldots, n-1\\). For each \\(k\\),\u00a0 \\(s_k \\)\nis the score assigned to a alternatives ranked in position \\(k\\).\nThen, the score for alternative \\(A\\), denoted \\(Score(A)\\), is\ncalculated as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\textit{Score}(A)=\\ &s_1\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) first}\\}\\\\\n &+ s_2\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) second}\\}\\\\\n &+ \\cdots \\\\\n &+ s_n\\times \\# \\{i\\ |\\ i \\text{ ranks \\(A\\) last}\\}.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBorda count for \\(n\\) alternatives uses scores \\((n-1, n-2, \\ldots,\n0)\\) (call \\(\\BS(X)\\)  the Borda score for candidate \\(X\\)).  \nNote that Plurality Rule can be viewed as a scoring rule that\nassigns 1 point to the first ranked candidate and 0 points to the\nother candidates. So, the plurality score of a candidate \\(X\\) is the number \nof voters that rank \\(X\\)  first.  Building on this idea, \\(k\\)-Approval Voting\nis a scoring method that gives 1 point to each candidate that is\nranked in position \\(k\\) or higher, and 0 points to all other\ncandidates. To illustrate \\(k\\)-Approval Voting, consider the\nfollowing election scenario: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n2\\(A\\s D\\s B\\s C\\)\n2\\(B\\s D\\s A\\s C\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\s D\\)\n\n\nThe winners according to 1-Approval Voting (which is the same as\nPlurality Rule) are \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\) \nThe winner according 2-Approval Voting is \\(D.\\) \nThe winners according to 3-Approval Voting are \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\)\n\n\n\n Note that the Condorcet winner is \\(A\\), so none of the above\nmethods guarantee that the Condorcet winner is elected\n(whether \\(A\\) is elected using 1-Approval or 3-Approval depends on\nthe tie-breaking mechanism that is used). \n\nA second way to make a voting method sensitive to more than the\nvoters\u2019 top choice is to hold \u201cmulti-stage\u201d elections. The\nidea is to successively remove candidates that perform poorly in the\nelection until there is one candidate that is ranked first by more\nthan 50% of the voters (i.e., there is a strict majority winner). The\ndifferent stages can be actual \u201crunoff\u201d elections in which\nvoters are asked to evaluate a reduced set of candidates; or they can\nbe built in to the way the winner is calculated by asking voters to\nsubmit rankings over the set of all candidates. The first example of a\nmulti-stage method is used to elect the French president. \n\nPlurality with Runoff:\n\nStart with a plurality vote to determine the top two candidates (the\ncandidates ranked first and second according to their plurality scores).\nIf a candidate is ranked first by more than 50% of the voters, then\nthat candidate is declared the winner. If there is no candidate with\na strict majority of first place votes, then there is a runoff\nbetween the top two candidates (or more if there are ties). The\ncandidate(s) with the most votes in the runoff elections is(are) declared the\nwinner(s).\n\n\nRather than focusing on the top two candidates, one can also\niteratively remove the candidate(s) with the fewest first-place votes:\n\n\nThe Hare Rule:\n\nThe ballots are rankings of the candidates. If a candidate is ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters, then that candidate is declared\nthe winner. If there is no candidate with a strict majority of first\nplace votes, repeatedly delete the candidate or candidates that\nreceive the fewest first-place votes (i.e., the candidate(s) with the lowest plurality \nscore(s)). The first candidate to be ranked\nfirst by strict majority of voters is declared the winner (if there is\nno such candidate, then the remaining candidate(s) are declared the\nwinners).\n\n\n\t\nThe Hare Rule is also called Ranked-Choice Voting, Alternative Vote, and \nInstant Runoff.  If there are only three candidates, then the above two voting methods\nare the same (removing the candidate with the lowest plurality score is\nthe same as keeping the two candidates with highest and second-highest plurality score). The following example\nshows that they can select different winners when there are more than\nthree candidates: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n7\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s D\\)\n5\\(B\\s C\\s D\\s A\\)\n4\\(D\\s B\\s C\\s A\\)\n3\\(C\\s D\\s A\\s B\\)\nCandidate \\(A\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\tCandidate \\(D\\) is the Hare Rule winner\n\n\n\nCandidate \\(A\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner: Candidates \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are the top two candidates, being ranked first by 7 and 5\nvoters, respectively. In the runoff election (using the rankings from\nthe above table), the groups voting for candidates \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\ntransfer their support to candidates \\(B\\) and \\(A,\\) respectively,\nwith \\(A\\) winning 10 \u2013 9. \n\nCandidate \\(D\\) is the Hare Rule winner: In the first round, candidate\n\\(C\\) is eliminated since she is only ranked first by 3 voters. This\ngroup\u2019s votes are transferred to \\(D\\), giving him 7 votes. This means\nthat in the second round, candidate \\(B\\) is ranked first by the\nfewest voters (5 voters rank \\(B\\) first in the profile with candidate\n\\(C\\) removed), and so is eliminated. After the elimination of\ncandidate \\(B\\), candidate \\(D\\) has a strict majority of the\nfirst-place votes: 12 voters ranking him first (note that in this\nround the group in the second column transfers all their votes to\n\\(D\\) since \\(C\\) was eliminated in an earlier round). \n\nThe core idea of multi-stage methods is to successively remove\ncandidates that perform \"poorly\" in an election. For the Hare Rule,\nperforming poorly is interpreted as receiving the fewest first place\nvotes. There are other ways to identify \"poorly performing\" candidates\nin an election scenario. For instance, the Coombs Rule successively\nremoves candidates that are ranked last by the most voters (see\nGrofman and Feld 2004 for an overview of Coombs Rule). \n\nCoombs Rule:\n\nThe ballots are rankings of the candidates. If a candidate is ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters, then that candidate is declared\nthe winner. If there is no candidate with a strict majority of first\nplace votes, repeatedly delete the candidate or candidates that\nreceive the most last-place votes. The first candidate to be ranked\nfirst by a strict majority of voters is declared the winner (if there is\nno such candidate, then the remaining candidate(s) are declared the\nwinners).\n\n\nIn the above example, candidate \\(B\\) wins the election using Coombs\nRule. In the first round, \\(A\\), with 9 last-place votes, is\neliminated. Then, candidate \\(B\\) receives 12 first-place votes, which\nis a strict majority, and so is declared the winner. \n There is  a technical issue that is important to keep in mind regarding \n\tthe above definitions of the multi-stage voting methods.  When  identifying \n\tthe poorly performing candidates in each round, there may be ties (i.e., there \nmay  be more than one candidate with the lowest plurality  score or more  than one candidate\nranked last by the most voters).  In the above definitions, I assume that all of the poorly \nperforming candidates will be removed in each round.   An alternative approach would use a tie-breaking rule to select one of the poorly performing candidates to be removed at each round.    \n\n",
