Temporality and the limits of reflective self-consciousness\n\nOne advantage of the phenomenological view is that it is capable of\naccounting for some degree of diachronic unity, without having to\nposit the self as a separate entity over and above the stream of\nconsciousness. Although we live through a number of different\nexperiences, the experiencing itself remains a constant in regard to\nwhose experience it is. This is not accounted for by a substantial\nself or a mental theater. On this point Hume was right. There is no\npure or empty field of consciousness upon which the concrete\nexperiences subsequently make their entry. The field of experiencing\nis nothing apart from the specific experiences. Yet we are naturally\ninclined to distinguish the strict singularity of an experience from\nthe continuous stream of changing experiences. What remains constant\nand consistent across these changes is the sense of for-me-ness (or\nperspectival ownership) constituted by prereflective\nself-consciousness. Only a being with this sense of ownership could go\non to form concepts about herself, consider her own aims, ideals, and\naspirations as her own, construct stories about herself, and plan and\nexecute actions for which she will take responsibility.\n\nAccording to Husserl\u2019s analysis, experience of any sort\n(perception, memory, imagination, etc.) has a common temporal\nstructure such that any moment of experience contains a retentional\nreference to past moments of experience, a current openness (primal\nimpression) to what is present, and a protentional anticipation of the\nmoments of experience that are just about to happen (Husserl 1966; see\nGallagher 1998). The retentional structure of experience, that is, the\nfact that when I am experiencing something, each passing moment of\nconsciousness does not simply disappear at the next moment but is kept\nin intentional currency, constitutes a coherency that stretches over\nan experienced temporal duration. Husserl\u2019s favorite example is\na melody. When I experience a melody, I don\u2019t simply experience\na knife-edge presentation (primal impression) of one note, which is\nthen completely washed away and replaced with the next discrete\nknife-edge presentation of the next note. Rather, consciousness\nretains the sense of the first note as just past, as I hear the second\nnote, a hearing that is also enriched by an anticipation (protention)\nof the next note (or at least, in case I do not know the melody, a\nsense that there will be a next note, or some next auditory event).\nHusserl claims that we actually do perceive melodies\u2014in\nopposition to an earlier view propounded by Brentano, viz., that with\nthe help of our imagination or recollection we construct or\nreconstruct such unities out of a synthesis of mental acts. That we\nactually perceive melodies (without first constructing them using\nmemory and imagination) is possible only because consciousness is so\nstructured to allow for this temporal presentation.\n\nImportantly, the temporal (retentional-impressional-protentional)\nstructure of consciousness not only allows for the experience of\ntemporally extended objects or intentional contents, but also entails\nthe self-manifestation of consciousness, that is, its prereflective\nself-consciousness. The retention of past notes of the melody is\naccomplished, not by a \u201creal\u201d or literal re-presentation\nof the notes (as if I were hearing them a second time and\nsimultaneously with the current note), but by an intentional retaining\nof my just past experience of the melody as just past. This\nmeans that this retentional structure gives me an immediate awareness\nof my ongoing experience in the ongoing flow of experience, a\nself-awareness that is implicit in my experience of the object. At the\nsame time that I am aware of a melody, for example, I am co-aware of\nmy ongoing experience of the melody through the retentional structure\nof that very experience\u2014and this just is the prereflective\nself-consciousness of experience (see Zahavi 1999, 2003).\n\nThe temporal structure that accounts for prereflective\nself-consciousness is also the structural feature that accounts for\nthe limitations imposed on reflective self-consciousness. Reflective\nself-consciousness yields knowledge of prereflective subjectivity that\nis always after the fact. Reflective self-consciousness, which takes\nprereflective experience as its object, is itself (like any conscious\nexperience) characterized by the same temporal structure. In\nprinciple, however, the retentional-impressional-protentional\nstructure of reflection cannot overlay the\nretentional-impressional-protentional structure of prereflective\nexperience in complete simultaneity. There is always a slight delay\nbetween reflection and the prereflective object of reflection. One\nmight say that the prereflective experience must first be there if I\nam to turn my reflective attention to it and make it an object of\nreflection. Husserl writes: \u201cWhen I say I, I grasp\nmyself in a simple reflection. But this self-experience\n[Selbsterfahrung] is like every experience\n[Erfahrung], and in particular every perception, a mere\ndirecting myself towards something that was already there for me, that\nwas already conscious, but not thematically experienced, not\nnoticed\u201d (Husserl 1973b, 492\u2013493). This delay is one of\nthe reasons why there remains a difference or distance between the\nreflecting subject and the reflected object, even though the reflected\nobject is my own experience. As a reflecting subject, I never fully\ncoincide with myself.\n\nAs Merleau-Ponty puts it, our temporal existence is both a condition\nfor and an obstacle to our self-comprehension. Temporality contains an\ninternal fracture that permits us to return to our past experiences in\norder to investigate them reflectively, but this very fracture also\nprevents us from fully coinciding with ourselves. There will always\nremain a difference between the lived and the understood\n(Merleau-Ponty 1945, 76, 397, 399, 460). Self-consciousness provides\nus with the sense that we are always already in play. This leads some\nphenomenologists to note that we are born (or \u201cthrown\u201d\ninto the world) and not self-generated. We are caught up in a life\nthat is in excess of our full comprehension (Heidegger 1986). There is\nalways something about ourselves that we cannot fully capture in the\nmoment of self-conscious reflection.\n\nPervasive prereflective self-consciousness is consequently not to be\nunderstood as complete self-comprehension. One can accept the notion\nof a pervasive self-consciousness and still accept the existence of\nthe unconscious in the sense of subjective components which remain\nambiguous, obscure, and resistant to comprehension. Thus, one should\ndistinguish between the claim that consciousness is characterized by\nan immediate first-person character and the claim that consciousness\nis characterized by total self-transparency. One can easily accept the\nfirst and reject the latter (Ricoeur 1950, 354\u2013355).\n\nIf reflective self-consciousness is limited in this way, this should\nnot prevent us from exercising it in an adequate way for attaining\nmoral self-responsibility, as Husserl points out. Reflection is a\nprecondition for self-critical deliberation. If we are to subject our\ndifferent beliefs and desires to a critical, normative evaluation, it\nis not sufficient simply to have immediate first-personal access to\nthe states in question.\n\nWe take as our point of departure the essential ability for\nself-consciousness in the full sense of personal self-inspection\n(inspectio sui), and the ability that is based on this for\ntaking up positions that are reflectively directed back on oneself and\none\u2019s own life, on personal acts of self-knowledge,\nself-evaluation, and practical acts of self-determination,\nself-willing, and self-formation. (Husserl 1988, 23).\n\n\nSelf-consciousness is, therefore, not epiphenomenal. Our ability to\nmake reflective judgments about our own beliefs and desires also\nallows us to modify them.\n\nOne might see the position of Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty as\nbeing situated between two extremes. On the one hand, we have the view\nthat reflection merely copies or mirrors prereflective experience\nfaithfully, and on the other hand we have the view that reflection\ndistorts lived experience. The middle course is to recognize that\nreflection involves a gain and a loss. For Husserl, Sartre, and\nMerleau-Ponty, reflection is constrained by what is prereflectively\nlived through. It is answerable to experiential facts and is not\nconstitutively self-fulfilling. At the same time, however, they\nrecognized that reflection qua thematic self-experience does not\nsimply reproduce the lived experiences unaltered and that this is\nprecisely what makes reflection cognitively valuable. The experiences\nreflected upon are transformed in the process, to various degrees and\nmanners depending upon the type of reflection at work. Subjectivity\nconsequently seems to be constituted in such a fashion that it can\nand, at times, must relate to itself in an \u201cothering\u201d\nmanner. This self-alteration is something inherent to reflection; it\nis not something that reflection can overcome.\n",
