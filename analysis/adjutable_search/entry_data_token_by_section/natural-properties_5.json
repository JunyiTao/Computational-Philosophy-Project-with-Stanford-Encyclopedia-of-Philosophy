For\nexample, the proposition that some things are green should count as\nmore natural than the proposition that some things are grue. While the\nuse of \u2018natural\u2019 to apply to propositions is rare, talk of\npropositions\u2014or of proposition-like entities like\nhypotheses, theories, accounts,\nproposals, etc.\u2014as being more or less simple\nis ubiquitous, in science as well as philosophy, and arguably amounts\nto the same thing.\n\nA few authors identify propositions with properties: for example,\nLewis\n (1986b,\n 53\u20134) holds that the proposition that some swans are blue is\nbeing a world containing a blue swan. Others (e.g. Bealer\n 1982)\n reject this identification, but still treat propositions as\nproperty-like: as binary relations stand to the number 2 and monadic\nproperties stand to 1, propositions stand to 0. Given either of these\nviews, the notion of a natural proposition should raise no new\n difficulties.[6]\n\nThis way of thinking of propositions is not universal, however. For\nmany authors, a central role of propositions is to play a certain role\nin the theory of mental states and/or linguistic meaning (see the\nentry on\n propositions).\n This role is often taken to motivate an account of propositions as\nmore \u201cfinely individuated\u201d than properties. For example,\nsome would distinguish the proposition that there are vixens from the\nproposition that there are female foxes, on the grounds that someone\ncould believe one but not the other, while also identifying the\nproperty of being a vixen with the property of being a female fox.\nMany who hold such views also recognise a coarser-grained\ndomain of entities\u2014sometimes called \u2018states of\naffairs\u2019 (see the entry on\n states of affairs)\u2014that\n stand to 0 as \\(n\\)-ary properties stand to \\(n\\). Some also\nrecognise fine-grained entities, sometimes called concepts,\nthat stand to positive integers as propositions stand to 0. For\nexample, they may say that the concept being a vixen is\ndistinct from the concept being a female fox, although they\ncorrespond to the same property. In this setting, it is less obvious\nhow one might understand comparisons of naturalness for propositions\nand concepts, assuming one wants to allow for differences in\nnaturalness between distinct propositions corresponding to the same\nstate of affairs, or between distinct concepts corresponding to the\nsame property. The question how such comparisons might be conceived,\nand whether they have anything to do with naturalness for properties,\nwill depend on issues in the theory of mental and linguistic content\nthat are beyond the scope of this article.\n",
