It thus belongs to proof search. Various methods of proof\nsearch have been discovered and discussed in computer science:\nresolution and tableau systems are prominent examples. However, from a\nsemantical perspective, reductive approaches are not conceptually\nsecondary to deduction but are theories in their own right. One might\neven suggest that reductive methods are primary from the semantical\npoint of view, as the search for an argument, or the possible ways of\nsearching for it, constitute the meaning of a given claim. This idea\nhas been adopted, for example, in dialogical or game-theoretical\nsemantics, but can and should be incorporated in proof-theoretic\nsemantics in general. This is a major desideratum of proof-theoretic\nsemantics, which so far is predominantly based on deduction rather\nthan reduction.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the idea of reductive logic and its semantics see the\nmonograph by David Pym and Eike Ritter (2004).\n\nFor dialogical logic see the entry on\n dialogical logic\n as well as Thomas Piecha\u2019s entry on\n dialogical logic\n the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nFor game-theoretical approaches in logic see the entry on\n logic and games.\n3.10 Substructural approaches\n\nAs soon as one treats proof-theoretic semantics in the framework of\nthe sequent calculus and thus focuses on hypothetical rather than\ncategorical claims, the area of logics with restricted structural\nrules, called \u201csubstructural logics\u201d, demands semantical\nconsideration. Here the way assumptions are introduced and kept in\none\u2019s discourse represents a much more fine-grained structure\nthan assumptions in natural deduction, where they are normally\nconsidered to be sets of statements. Due to the possibility of\nstructuring the succedent of a sequent in an analogous way,\nproof-theoretic semantics looses its intuitionistic bias without\nnecessarily becoming classical. Within the framework of substructural\nlogic, deviant logical systems such as relevant logic or\nresource-sensitive logics can easily be modelled. A particularly\ninteresting topic is the logic of bunched implications, which\ndistinguishes different, but co-existing ways of structuring\nassumptions and conclusions (see Pym, 2002). Substructural logic is\nwell-established as a general tool to describe logical\nsystems within a single emcompassing structural framework. Whether\nsubstructural logic eo ipso represents a semantical\nframework, is still an open question.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor substructural logic in general see the entry on\n substructural logics.\n4. Conclusion and outlook\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics has practically exclusively been\noccupied with logical constants. Logical constants play a central role\nin reasoning and inference, but are definitely not the exclusive, and\nperhaps not even the most typical sort of entities that can be defined\ninferentially. A framework is needed that deals with inferential\ndefinitions in a wider sense and covers both logical and extra-logical\ninferential definitions alike. The idea of definitional reflection\nwith respect to arbitrary definitional rules (see section\n 2.3.2)\n and also natural language applications (see secton\n 3.4)\n point in this direction, but farther reaching conceptions can be\nimagined. Furthermore, the concentration on harmony, inversion\nprinciples, definitional reflection and the like is somewhat\nmisleading, as it might suggest that proof-theoretic semantics\nconsists of only that. It should be emphasized that already when it\ncomes to arithmetic, stronger principles are needed in addition to\ninversion. However, in spite of these limitations, proof-theoretic\nsemantics has already gained very substantial achievements that can\ncompete with more widespread approaches to semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor contributions on a variety of aspects of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee the reader edited by Piecha and Wehmeier (2023, open access).",
