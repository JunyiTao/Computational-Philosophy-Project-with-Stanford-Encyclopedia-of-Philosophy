    "main_text": "How to Atone || Penance\n2.6 Penance\n\nThe word \u201cpenance\u201d is most familiar today from the Roman\nCatholic sacrament of penance. Used to refer to the sacrament in its\nentirety, it refers to a process involving contrition for sin,\nconfession, satisfaction, and absolution. The word is often used more\nnarrowly to describe the third step of that process, satisfaction\n(Barton 1961). However, although penance in this narrower sense may\nsometimes include the sorts of things that are described in\n section 2.5,\n those things are done with a different purpose qua\npenance.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, penance\u2014the sacrament\u2014is a sort of\nmedicine for the soul (John Paul II 1984: 31). Each part of the\nsacrament is medicinal, including satisfaction\u2014or penance,\nnarrowly construed (Aquinas ST supp 12.3). Penance, in the\nnarrow sense, in part can involve reparation since making reparation\nis part of how we make amends and atone, and thus remove guilt for our\nsin. But penance is also medicinal in another way: it is supposed to\nexpress a desire for and help bring about moral and spiritual\ntransformation. Consequently, many penances \u2013such as saying\ncertain prayers, or reading certain spiritual texts, or giving\nalms\u2014do not offer reparation to the human victim of one\u2019s\nsin (they may amount to reparation to God). Penance, in the narrower\nsense, thus denotes a certain class of acts that express a desire for\nand aid in bringing about what was discussed in\n section 2.4\u2014moral\n transformation\u2014as well as spiritual transformation.\n\nPenance, in the narrower sense, can thus also have a secular meaning\nif the notion is narrowed even further: x does penance for\nwrong R if and only if x does something to express a\ndesire for and to help produce moral transformation in response to\nhaving done R. Criminals may in this sense do penance for\ntheir crimes by, say, doing community service or by committing\nthemselves to helping other people to avoid committing similar sorts\nof crimes.\n\nRichard Swinburne proposes a different secular notion of penance:\npenance is something a wrongdoer provides to his victim that (i) is\noffered in addition to reparation or compensation, and (ii) is offered\nas a way of disowning the wrong action by indicating his appreciation\nfor the victim, his awareness of the seriousness of the wrong, and his\nsorrow at having wronged the victim (Swinburne 1989: 83\u201384).\nPenance, in this sense, is significant as a performative act of\ndisowning. Apologies can be insincere or routine, and reparation can\nbe done without a spirit of contrition and sorrow. Penance, in\nSwinburne\u2019s sense, helps the wrongdoer to adequately communicate\nto his victim contrition, sorrow, and appreciation.\n",
