    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Equality of Welfare\n3.4 Equality of Welfare\n\nThe concept of welfare equality is motivated by an intuition that when\nit comes to political ethics, what is at stake is individual\nwell-being. The central criterion for justice must consequently be\nequalizing the level of welfare. But taking welfare as what is to be\nequalized leads to difficulties resembling those of utilitarianism. If\none contentiously identifies subjective welfare with preference\nsatisfaction, it seems implausible to count all individual preferences\nas equal, some \u2013 such as the desire to do others wrong \u2013\nbeing inadmissible on grounds of justice (the offensive taste\nargument). Any welfare-centered concept of equality grants people with\nrefined and expensive taste more resources \u2013 something\ndistinctly at odds with our moral intuitions (the expensive taste\nargument) (Dworkin 1981a). However, satisfaction in the fulfillment of\ndesires cannot serve as a standard, since we wish for more than a\nsimple feeling of happiness. A more viable standard for welfare\ncomparisons would seem to be success in the fulfillment of\npreferences. A fair evaluation of such success cannot be purely\nsubjective, but requires a standard of what should or could have been\nachieved. This itself involves an assumption regarding just\ndistribution, so it cannot stand as an independent criterion for\njustice. Another serious problem with any welfare-centered concept of\nequality is that it cannot take account of either desert (Feinberg\n1970) or personal responsibility for one\u2019s own well-being, to the\nextent this is possible and reasonable.\n",
