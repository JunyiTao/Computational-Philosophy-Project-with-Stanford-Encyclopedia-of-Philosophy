    "main_text": "Other Types of Protest || Legal Protest\n2.1 Legal Protest\n\nThe obvious difference between legal protest and civil disobedience is\nthat the former lies within the bounds of the law, but the latter does\nnot. Legal ways of protesting include, among many others, making\nspeeches, signing petitions, organizing for a cause, donating money,\ntaking part in authorized demonstrations, and boycotting. Some of\nthese can become illegal, for instance when law enforcement declares\nan assembly unlawful and orders the crowd to disperse, or under\nanti-boycott legislation. Some causes may also be declared illegal,\nsuch that one cannot be associated with the cause or donate to it\n(such as the Communist Party in the U.S.). Most of the features\nexemplified in civil disobedience \u2013 other than its illegality\n\u2013 can be found in legal protest: a conscientious and\ncommunicative demonstration of protest, a desire to bring about\nthrough moral dialogue some lasting change in policy or principle, an\nattempt to educate and to raise awareness, and so on.\n",
