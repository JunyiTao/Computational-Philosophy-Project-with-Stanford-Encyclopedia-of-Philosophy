    "main_text": "Statistics and induction\n1. Statistics and induction\n\nStatistics is a mathematical and conceptual discipline that focuses on the relation\nbetween data and hypotheses. The data are recordings of\nobservations or events in a scientific study, e.g., a set of\nmeasurements of individuals from a population. The data actually\nobtained are variously called the sample, the sample\ndata, or simply the data, and all possible samples from\na study are collected in what is called a sample\nspace. The hypotheses, in turn, are general\nstatements about the target system of the scientific study, e.g.,\nexpressing some general fact about all individuals in the population.\nA statistical hypothesis is a general statement that can\nbe expressed by a probability distribution over sample space, i.e., it\ndetermines a probability for each of the possible samples. \nStatistical methods provide the mathematical and conceptual means\nto evaluate statistical hypotheses in the light of a sample. To this\nend the methods employ probability theory, and incidentally generalizations\nthereof. The evaluations may determine how believable a hypothesis is,\nwhether we may rely on the hypothesis in our decisions, how strong the\nsupport is that the sample gives to the hypothesis, and so on. Good\nintroductions to statistics abound (e.g., Barnett 1999, Mood and\nGraybill 1974, Press 2002).\nTo set the stage an example, taken from Fisher (1935), will be\nhelpful.\n\nThe tea tasting lady.  Consider a lady who\nclaims that she can, by taste, determine the order in which milk and\ntea were poured into the cup. Now imagine that we prepare five cups of\ntea for her, tossing a fair coin to determine the order of milk and\ntea in each cup. We ask her to pronounce the order, and we find that\nshe is correct in all cases! Now if she is guessing the order blindly\nthen, owing to the random way we prepare the cups, she will answer\ncorrectly 50% of the time. This is our statistical hypothesis,\nreferred to as the null hypothesis. It gives a probability of \\(1/2\\)\nto a correct guess and hence a probability of \\(1/2\\) to an incorrect\none. The sample space consists of all strings of answers the lady\nmight give, i.e., all series of correct and incorrect guesses, but our\nactual data sits in a rather special corner in this space. On the\nassumption of our statistical hypothesis, the probability of the\nrecorded events is a mere 3%, or \\(1/2^{5}\\) more precisely. On this\nground, we may decide to reject the hypothesis that the lady is\nguessing.\nAccording to the so-called null hypothesis test, such a\ndecision is warranted if the data actually obtained are included in a\nparticular region within sample space, whose total probability does\nnot exceed some specified limit, standardly set at 5%. Now consider\nwhat is achieved by the statistical test just outlined. We started\nwith a hypothesis on the actual tea tasting abilities of the lady,\nnamely, that she did not have any. On the assumption of this\nhypothesis, the sample data we obtained turned out to be surprising\nor, more precisely, highly improbable. We therefore decided that the\nhypothesis that the lady has no tea tasting abilities whatsoever can\nbe rejected. The sample points us to a negative but general conclusion\nabout what the lady can, or cannot, do.\nThe basic pattern of a statistical analysis is thus familiar from\ninductive inference: we input the data obtained thus far, and the\nstatistical procedure outputs a verdict or evaluation that transcends\nthe data, i.e, a statement that is not entailed by the data alone. If\nthe data are indeed considered to be the only input, and if the\nstatistical procedure is understood as an inference, then statistics\nis concerned with ampliative inference: roughly speaking, we\nget out more than we have put in. And since the ampliative inferences\nof statistics pertain to future or general states of affairs, they are\ninductive.  However, the association of statistics with ampliative and\ninductive inference is contested, both because statistics is\nconsidered to be non-inferential by some (see \n Section 3) and\nnon-ampliative by others (see \n Section 4).\nDespite such disagreements, it is insightful to view statistics as\na response to the problem of induction (cf. Howson 2000 and the\n entry on the\n problem of induction). \nThis problem, first discussed by Hume in his Treatise of Human\nNature (Book I, part 3, section 6) but prefigured already by\nancient sceptics like Sextus Empiricus (see the entry on\n ancient skepticism), \nis that there is no proper justification for\ninferences that run from given experience to expectations about the\nfuture. Transposed to the context of statistics, it reads that there\nis no proper justification for procedures that take data as input and\nthat return a verdict, an evaluation, or some other piece of advice\nthat pertains to the future, or to general states of affairs. Arguably,\nmuch of the philosophy of statistics is about coping with this\nchallenge, by providing a foundation of the procedures that statistics\noffers, or else by reinterpreting what statistics delivers so as to\nevade the challenge.\nIt is debatable that philosophers of statistics are ultimately\nconcerned with the delicate, even ethereal issue of the justification\nof induction. In fact, many philosophers and scientists accept the\nfallibility of statistics, and find it more important that statistical\nmethods are understood and applied correctly. As is so often the case,\nthe fundamental philosophical problem serves as a catalyst: the\nproblem of induction guides our investigations into the workings, the\ncorrectness, and the conditions of applicability of statistical\nmethods. The philosophy of statistics, understood as the general\nheader under which these investigations are carried out, is thus not\nconcerned with ephemeral issues, but presents a vital and concrete\ncontribution to the philosophy of science, and to science itself.\n",
