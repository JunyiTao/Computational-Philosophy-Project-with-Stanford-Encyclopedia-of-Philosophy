    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nAdam Wodeham [Goddam/Woodham] (c. 1295\u20131358) was born near\nSouthampton. He entered the Franciscan order at a young age.\nWodeham\u2019s earliest philosophical education was at the Franciscan\nstudium in London where he first studied under Walter Chatton\n(c. 1317\u20131321) and then William of Ockham (1320\u20131324).\nDuring this period of intense study, Wodeham collaborated with Ockham\non his massive Summa logicae, editing it and preparing it for\npublication. After Ockham departed for Avignon in the summer of 1324,\nWodeham was sent to Oxford to complete his studies. At Oxford he\nattended the sentential lectures of Richard FitzRalph\n(1328\u20131329), and subsequently qualified to read the\nSentences.\n\nWodeham lectured on the Sentences of Peter Lombard at the\nLondon convent sometime in the 1320s, although his earliest lecture\nnotes have not survived. He later lectured at the provincial school in\nNorwich sometime in the late 1320s, a work that is now referred to as\nthe Lectura secunda [LS]. Finally, Wodeham delivered the\nOxford lectures (referred to as the Ordinatio Oxoniensis\n[OO]) between 1332 and 1334 (Streveler and Tachau 1995, 22\u201323,\nn. 61). According to Thomas de Eccleston (Eccleston 1951, 57), Wodeham\nwas the 61st lector at Oxford, Greyfriars. As is the case\nwith many medieval philosophers, little is known about his latter life\nafter he completed is education. He apparently traveled to Basel in\n1339, survived the plague in 1348\u201349, and died at the Franciscan\nconvent at Babwell in 1358 (Courtenay 1978, 181).\n",
