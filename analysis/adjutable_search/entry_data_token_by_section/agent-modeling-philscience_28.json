In\norder to assess whether the results of an ABM are explanatory of a\ncertain empirical target, it is useful to check whether they are\nrobust under changes in the idealizing modeling assumptions. One way\nto do so is to construct a new model by replacing some assumptions in\nthe previous one. Moreover, using a model based on an entirely\ndifferent representational framework may additionally help in such\nrobustness studies. This is why the value of using multiple models to\nstudy the same research question has been increasingly emphasized in\nthe modeling literature.\n\nFor instance, Aydinonat, Reijula, and Ylikoski (2021) have argued for\nthe importance of the \u201cfamily-of-models perspective\u201d. The\nauthors consider models as argumentative devices, where an argument\nsupported by a given model can be strengthened by means of analyses\nbased on subsequent models. The approach according to which phenomena\nshould be studied by means of multiple models has also been endorsed\nin the broader context of modeling in social sciences (cf. Page 2018;\nKuhlmann 2021).\n\nIn sum, even though ABMs in philosophy of science tend to be highly\nidealized, they can have exploratory roles, such as identifying\npossible causal mechanisms underlying scientific inquiry, offering\nhow-possibly explanations, or providing conjectures and novel\nperspectives on historical case-studies (cf. \u0160e\u0161elja\n2022a). In addition, they can play more challenging epistemic roles\n(such as providing explanations of empirical phenomena or evidence for\nempirical hypotheses) if accompanied by validation procedures, which\nmay benefit from looking into classes of models aimed at the same\ntarget phenomenon.\n",
