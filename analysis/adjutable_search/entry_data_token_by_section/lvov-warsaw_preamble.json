    "main_text": "\n\nThe Lvov-Warsaw School (LWS) was the most important movement in the\nhistory of Polish philosophy. It was established by Kazimierz\nTwardowski at the end of the 19th century in Lvov (i.e.,\nthe Ukrainian city of Lviv, which at that time was part of the\nAustro-Hungarian Empire). The LWS flourished in the years\n1918\u20131939. Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski,\nStanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski, Jan \u0141ukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski\nare its most famous members. It was an analytical school similar to\nthe Vienna Circle in many respects. On the other hand, the attitude of\nthe LWS toward traditional philosophy was much more positive than that\nof logical empiricism. Although logic became the most important field\nin the activities of the LWS, its members were active in all spheres\nof philosophy. World War II and political changes in Poland after 1945\ncaused the end of the LWS as an organized philosophical enterprise.\nOne can consider it to have later been continued individually by its\nrepresentatives.\n",
