    "main_text": "Murdoch on Attention || Care ethics, feminism, and particularity\n10.1 Care ethics, feminism, and particularity\n Murdoch\u2019s (and through her, Weil\u2019s) view of (loving)\nattention as the core moral capacity influenced the development of\ncare ethics, especially in its early (and continuing) form as a type\nof feminist ethical outlook (Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984; Grimshaw\n1986; Ruddick 1989; Walker 1989; Bowden 1997). Care ethics emphasizes\nattentiveness and concern for the other person in her particularity,\ninformed by knowledge of the specific needs, desires, and situation of\nthat other person, in contrast to emphasizing a universal category\nsuch as \u201cperson\u201d or \u201chuman being\u201d as the\nappropriate target of attention and care. Murdoch\u2019s emphasis on\nthe reality of the particular other as the target of loving attention\nwas drawn on to develop this form of ethical theory.\n\nIn addition both care ethics and Murdoch tend to see personal\nrelationships as the primary domain of morality. Murdoch\u2019s focus\non personal fantasy as a prime obstacle to grasping the other\u2019s\nreality suggests that she is envisioning persons with whom we have a\npersonal relationship. But her language sometimes suggests a broader\nscope, perhaps to persons known to oneself but with whom one does not\nhave a personal relationship, or even the broader category of persons\none encounters in a fleeting way (e.g., fellow riders on the subway).\nShe seldom suggests that it means needy or suffering persons distant\nfrom oneself, or members of a general category (e.g., victims of\nCovid). Something like that idea surfaces only in\nMetaphysics, where Murdoch associates it with\nutilitarianism.\n\nVarieties of care ethics arose to encompass less personal forms of\nrelationship, and some also expanded this focus to take account of\ninstitutions and structures in which care relationships do, or should,\ntake place (Tronto 1993; Bowden 1997; Norlock 2019). Murdoch never goes in this\ninstitutional direction. At the same time, the centrality of the\nvisual metaphor in Murdoch\u2014attention, seeing, looking,\nvision\u2014does not sit comfortably with the emphasis in much care\nethics, especially in its feminist form, on the sustaining of ongoing\npersonal relationships involving mutuality and reciprocity, and more\ngenerally on the fundamentally relational character of the self. The\nattentive self is not portrayed by Murdoch as actively engaging with\nthe attended-to other in a reciprocal relationship. In\nMetaphysics, she actively defends the standing-apart of the\nmoral subject against the engaged relationality present in the Jewish\ntheologian Martin Buber\u2019s views (MGM 1992, ch 15: 361\u2013380.\nSee Cordner 2019 discussion). (Murdoch\u2019s overall relationship to\nfeminism is complex. For extended treatments, see Lovibond 2011;\nBolton forthcoming).\n",
