Introduction\n\nThe terms \u201cidealism\u201d and \u201cidealist\u201d are by no\nmeans used only within philosophy; they are used in many everyday\ncontexts as well. Optimists who believe that, in the long run, good\nwill prevail are often called \u201cidealists\u201d. This is not\nbecause such people are thought to be devoted to a philosophical\ndoctrine but because of their outlook on life generally; indeed, they\nmay even be pitied, or perhaps envied, for displaying a na\u00efve\nworldview and not being philosophically critical at all. Even within\nphilosophy, the terms \u201cidealism\u201d and\n\u201cidealist\u201d are used in different ways, which often makes\ntheir meaning dependent on the context. However, independently of\ncontext one can distinguish between a descriptive (or classificatory)\nuse of these terms and a polemical one, although sometimes these\ndifferent uses occur together. Their descriptive use is best\ndocumented by paying attention to the large number of different\n\u201cidealisms\u201d that appear in philosophical textbooks and\nencyclopedias, ranging from metaphysical idealism through\nepistemological and aesthetic to moral or ethical idealism. Within\nthese idealisms one can find further distinctions, such as those\nbetween subjective, objective and absolute idealism, and even more\nobscure characterizations such as speculative idealism and\ntranscendental idealism. It is also remarkable that the term\n\u201cidealism\u201d, at least within philosophy, is often used in\nsuch a way that it gets its meaning through what is taken to be its\nopposite: as the meaningful use of the term \u201coutside\u201d\ndepends on a contrast with something considered to be inside, so the\nmeaning of the term \u201cidealism\u201d is often fixed by what is\ntaken to be its opposite. Thus, an idealist is someone who is not a\nrealist, not a materialist, not a dogmatist, not an empiricist, and so\non. Given the fact that many also want to distinguish between realism,\nmaterialism, dogmatism, and empiricism, it is obvious that thinking of\nthe meaning of \u201cidealism\u201d as determined by what it is\nmeant to be opposed to leads to further complexity and gives rise to\nthe impression that underlying such characterizations lies some\npolemical intent.\n\nWithin modern philosophy there are sometimes taken to be two\nfundamental conceptions of idealism:\n\nsomething mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate\nfoundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality, and\nalthough the existence of something independent of the mind is\nconceded, everything that we can know about this\nmind-independent \u201creality\u201d is held to be so permeated by\nthe creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of\nsome kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered,\nin some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.\n\n\nIdealism in sense (1) has been called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d or\n\u201contological idealism\u201d, while idealism in sense (2) has\nbeen called \u201cformal\u201d or \u201cepistemological\nidealism\u201d. The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) might be\nconsidered to be George Berkeley\u2019s \u201cimmaterialism\u201d,\naccording to which all that exists are ideas and the minds, less than\ndivine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the\nterm \u201cidealism\u201d.) The fountainhead for idealism in sense\n(2) might be the position that Immanuel Kant asserted (if not clearly\nin the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781)\nthen in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and\nin the \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d in the second edition of\nthe Critique) according to which idealism does \u201cnot\nconcern the existence of things\u201d, but asserts only that our\n\u201cmodes of representation\u201d of them, above all space and\ntime, are not \u201cdeterminations that belong to things in\nthemselves\u201d but features of our own minds. Kant called his\nposition \u201ctranscendental\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d\nidealism, and it has also been called \u201cformal\u201d idealism.\nHowever, Kant\u2019s position does not provide a clear model of\nidealism at all. While Kant himself claimed that his position combined\n\u201cempirical realism\u201d with \u201ctranscendental\nidealism\u201d, that is, combined realism about external,\nspatio-temporal objects in ordinary life and science with the denial\nof the reality of space and time at the level of things as they are in\nthemselves, it also insisted upon the reality of things as they are in\nthemselves existing independently from our representations of them,\nthus denying their reducibility to representations or the minds that\nhave them. In this way, Kant\u2019s position actually combines the\ntranscendental ideality of space and time with a kind of realism about\nthe existence of things other than minds. \n\nSo instead of using Kant as any kind of model for epistemological\nidealism, in this entry we will distinguish between metaphysical and\nepistemological arguments for idealism understood as a metaphysical\ndoctrine, namely that everything that exists is in some way mental. We\nthus agree with A.C. Ewing, who wrote in 1934 that all forms of\nidealism \n\n\nhave in common the view that there can be no physical objects existing\napart from some experience, and this might perhaps be taken as the\ndefinition of idealism, provided that we regard thinking as part of\nexperience and do not imply by \u201cexperience\u201d passivity, and\nprovided we include under experience not only human experience but the\nso-called \u201cAbsolute Experience\u201d or the experience of a God\nsuch as Berkeley postulates. (Ewing 1934: 3) \n\n\nin other words, while reducing all reality to some kind of perception\nis one form of idealism, it is not the only form\u2014reality may be\nreduced to the mental on other conceptions of the latter. Thus Willem\ndeVries\u2019s more recent definition of idealism as the general\ntheory that reduces reality to some form or other of the mental is\njust: \n\n\nRoughly, the genus comprises theories that attribute ontological\npriority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideational, over\nthe non-mental. (deVries 2009: 211) \n\n\nWe also agree with Jeremy Dunham, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Sean Watson\nwhen they write that \n\n\nthe idealist, rather than being anti-realist, is in fact \u2026 a\nrealist concerning elements more usually dismissed from reality.\n(Dunham, Grant, & Watson 2011: 4) \n\n\nnamely mind of some kind or other: the idealist denies the\nmind-independent reality of matter, but hardly denies the reality of\nmind (or, on their account, which goes back to Plato, Ideas or Forms\nas well as minds; we will not consider pre-modern forms of idealism in\nany detail). However, following Ewing (see his chapters II,\nIV\u2013V, and VIII), we will distinguish metaphysical from\nepistemological arguments for idealism. Metaphysical arguments proceed\nby identifying some general constraints on existence and arguing that\nonly minds of some sort or other satisfy such conditions;\nepistemological arguments work by identifying some conditions for\nknowledge and arguing that only objects that are in some sense or\nother mental can satisfy the conditions for being known. In\nparticular, epistemological arguments for idealism assume that there\nis a necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object\nthat can obtain only if the object of knowledge is itself mental; we\npropose that this is the difference between\nepistemologically-motivated idealism and a more neutral position,\nwhich might be identified with philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap,\nW.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, holding that of course we always\nknow things from some point of view, but any \u201cexternal\u201d\nquestion about whether or not our point of view\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to independent reality is either meaningless\nor at least not answerable on theoretical grounds. It is in order to\npreserve the distinction between traditional idealism and positions\nsuch as the latter that we recommend retaining the claim that reality\nis in some way or other exclusively mental and thinking of\nepistemological arguments for idealism rather than epistemological\nidealism as such.\n\nOf course these strategies can be combined by a single philosopher.\nBerkeley does so, and so does Kant in arguing for the transcendental\nidealist part of his complex position. Others separate them, for\nexample F.H. Bradley and J.McT.E. McTaggart constructed metaphysical\narguments for idealism, while Josiah Royce and Brand Blanshard offered\nepistemological arguments.\n\nIn what follows, we will concentrate mainly on the discussion of\nphilosophical theories that either endorse or claim to endorse\nidealism on ontological and/or epistemological grounds. At some points\nin its complex history, however, above all in the social as well as\nphilosophical movement that dominated British and American\nuniversities in the second half of the nineteenth century and through\nthe first World War, idealism in either of its philosophical forms was\nindeed connected to idealism in the popular sense of progressive and\noptimistic social thought. This was true for figures such as Bradley\nand Royce and their predecessors and contemporaries such as Thomas\nHill Green and Bernard Bosanquet. There has recently been considerable\ninterest in British or more generally Anglophone idealism as a\nmovement in social philosophy, or even a social movement, but we will\nnot pursue that here (see Mander 2011; Boucher & Vincent 2012;\nMander [ed.] 2000; and Mander & Panagakou [eds.] 2016).\n\nOur distinctions between epistemological and ontological idealism, on\nthe one hand, and that between metaphysical and epistemological\narguments for idealism, on the other hand, has not always been clearly\nmade. However, the American philosopher Josiah Royce pointed in the\ndirection of our distinction at the end of the nineteenth century. On\nRoyce\u2019s definitions, epistemological idealism\n\n\ninvolves a theory of the nature of our human knowledge; and\nvarious decidedly different theories are called by this name in view\nof one common feature, namely, the stress that they lay upon the\n\u201csubjectivity\u201d of a larger or smaller portion of what\npretends to be our knowledge of things. (1892: xii\u2013xiii)\n\n\nMetaphysical idealism, he says, \u201cis a theory as to the\nnature of the real world, however we may come to know that\nnature\u201d (1892: xiii), namely, as he says quoting from another\nphilosopher of the time, \n\n\nthe \u201cbelief in a spiritual principle at the basis of the world,\nwithout the reduction of the physical world to a mere illusion\u201d.\n(1892: xiii; quoting Falckenberg 1886: 476). \n\n\nBut Royce then argued that epistemological idealism ultimately entails\na foundation of metaphysical idealism, in particular that \u201cthe\nquestion as to how we \u2018transcend\u2019 the\n\u2018subjective\u2019 in our knowledge\u201d, that is, the purely\nindividual, although it exists for both metaphysical realists and\nidealists, can only be answered by metaphysical idealists (1892: xiv).\nWe will argue similarly that while epistemology can entail idealism,\non the assumption that the isomorphism between knowledge and the known\nmust be in some sense necessary and that this can be so only if the\nknown as well as knowledge is in some sense mental, this should be\ndistinguished from the more general and extremely widespread view that\nour knowledge is always formed within our own point of view,\nconceptual framework, or web of belief. This view may well be the\ndefault position of much twentieth-century philosophy,\n\u201ccontinental\u201d as well as \u201canalytic\u201d, but does\nnot by itself entail that reality is essentially mental.\n\nOur distinction between epistemological and metaphysical arguments for\nidealism can also be associated with a distinction between two major\nkinds of motives for idealism: those which are grounded in\nself-conceptions, i.e., in convictions about the role that the self or\nthe human being plays in the world, and those based on what might\ncorrespondingly be called world-convictions, i.e., on conceptions\nabout the way the world is constituted objectively or at least appears\nto be constituted to a human subject. Concerning motives based on\nself-conceptions of human beings, idealism has seemed hard to avoid by\nmany who have taken freedom in one of its many guises (freedom of\nchoice, freedom of the will, freedom as autonomy) to be an integral\npart of any conception of the self worth pursuing, because the belief\nin the reality of freedom often goes together with a commitment to\nsome version of mental causation, and it is tempting to think that the\neasiest (or at least the most economical) way to account for mental\ncausation consists in \u201cmentalizing\u201d or idealizing all of\nreality, thus leading to ontological idealism, or at least to maintain\nthat the kind of causal determinism that seems to conflict with\nfreedom is only one of our ways of representing the world, thus\nleading to epistemological idealism. Motives for idealism based on\nworld-convictions can be found in many different attitudes towards\nobjectivity. If one is to believe in science as the best and only way\nto get an objective (subject-independent) conception of reality, one\nmight still turn to idealism, at least epistemological idealism,\nbecause of the conditions supposed to be necessary in order to make\nsense of the very concept of a law (of nature) or of the normativity\nof logical inferences for nature itself. If one believes in the\nnon-conventional reality of normative facts one might also be drawn to\nidealism in order to account for their non-physical\nreality\u2014Plato\u2019s idealism, which asserts the reality of\nnon-physical Ideas to explain the status of norms and then reduces all\nother reality to mere simulacra of the former might be considered a\nforerunner of ontological idealism motivated by concern for the\nreality of norms. An inclination toward idealism might even arise from\nconsiderations pertaining to the ontological status of aesthetic\nvalues (is beauty an objective attribute of objects?) or from the\ninability or the unwillingness to think of the constitution of social\nand cultural phenomena like society or religion in terms of physical\ntheory. In short: There are about as many motives and reasons for\nendorsing idealism as there are different aspects of reality to be\nknown or explained.\n\nAlthough we have just referred to Plato, the term\n\u201cidealism\u201d became the name for a whole family of positions\nin philosophy only in the course of the eighteenth century. Even then,\nthose whom critics called \u201cidealists\u201d did not identify\nthemselves as such until the time of Kant, and no sooner did the label\ncome into use than did those to whom it was applied or who used it\nthemselves attempt to escape it or refine it. As already mentioned,\nBerkeley, the paradigmatic idealist in the British tradition, did not\nuse the name for his own position, which he called rather\nimmaterialism; and Leibniz, at least some versions of whose monadology\nmight be considered idealist, also did not call his position by that\nname. Rather, in contrasting Epicurus with Plato, Leibniz called the\nlatter an idealist and the former a materialist, because according to\nhim idealists like Plato hold that \u201ceverything occurs in the\nsoul as if there were no body\u201d whereas on the materialism of\nEpicurus \u201ceverything occurs in the body as if there were no\nsoul\u201d (\u201cReply to the Thoughts on the System of\nPre-established Harmony contained in the Second Edition of Mr.\nBayle\u2019s Critical Dictionary, Article Rorarius\u201d, 1702,\nPPL: 578), although in this text Leibniz also says that his\nown view combines both of these positions. It seems to have been\nChristian Wolff who first used \u201cidealism\u201d explicitly as a\nclassificatory term. Wolff, often considered the most dedicated\nLeibnizian of his time (although in fact his position was more\neclectic than at least some versions of Leibniz\u2019s) set out to\nintegrate the terms \u201cidealism\u201d and\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d into his taxonomy of philosophical attitudes\nof those \u201cwho strive towards the knowledge and philosophy of\nthings\u201d in the Preface to the other [second] Edition of\nhis so-called German Metaphysics [Vern\u00fcnfftige\nGedancken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen\nDingen \u00fcberhaupt, den Liebhabern der Wahrheit mitgetheilet\n(Halle: Carl Hermann Hemmerde, 1747)]. Wolff distinguishes between two\nbasic attitudes, one of which he sees exemplified by the skeptic, the\nother by what he calls \u201cthe dogmatist\u201d. The skeptic doubts\nthe possibility of knowledge in general and thus refuses to defend any\npositive claim at all. By contrast, the dogmatist puts forward\npositive doctrines, and these can be divided into those which posit as\nfundamental either one single kind of entities [Art der\nDinge] or two different kinds. Wolff names the supporters of the\nfirst position \u201cmonists\u201d and the adherents of the second\n\u201cdualists\u201d. This amounts to the division of all dogmatic\ndoctrines, i.e., all knowledge-claims with respect to the ultimate\nconstitution of reality, into monistic and dualistic theories. Here is\nwhere the term \u201cidealist\u201d then makes its appearance in\nWolff\u2019s typology: he distinguishes within the monists between\nidealists and materialists. Idealists \u201cconcede only spirits or\nelse those things that do not consist of matter\u201d, whereas\nmaterialists \u201cdo not accept anything in philosophy other than\nthe corporeal and take spirits and souls to be a corporeal\nforce\u201d. Dualists, on the contrary, are happy \u201cto accept\nboth bodies and spirits as real and mutually independent\nthings\u201d. Wolff then goes on to distinguish within idealism\nbetween \u201cegoism\u201d and \u201cpluralism\u201d, depending on\nwhether an idealist thinks just of himself as a real entity or whether\nhe will allow for more than one (spiritual) entity; the first of these\npositions would also come to be called solipsism, so that solipsism\nwould be a variety of (ontological) idealism but not all idealism\nwould be solipsism.\n\nWolff\u2019s way of classifying a philosophical system was enormously\ninfluential in eighteenth-century Continental philosophy\u2014for\nexample, it was closely followed by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in\nhis 1739 Metaphysica, which was in turn used by Kant as the\ntextbook for his metaphysics (and anthropology) lectures throughout\nhis career, and whose definition of dogmatic idealism, as contrasted\nto his own \u201ctranscendental\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nidealism, would also be that it is the position according to which\nthere are only minds\u2014and so it is no surprise that almost all\ntalk about idealism was heavily influenced by Wolff\u2019s\ncharacterization. This is so because it reflects the main metaphysical\ndisputes in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century philosophy on\nthe Continent quite well. In terms of Wolff\u2019s distinctions,\nthese disputes can be framed as disputes between (a) monists and\ndualists and (b) idealists and materialists; positions in this debate\nwere often influenced by perplexities surrounding the (ontological)\nquestion of the interaction of substances, although they were also\ninfluenced by the (epistemological) debate over innatism. Although\nneither dualism, whose main representative was Descartes (who asserted\nthe existence of both res cogitans and res extensa),\nnor monism, allegedly though debatably represented by Spinoza in its\nmaterialistic version (substantia, deus, natura) and by\nLeibniz in its idealistic form (monad, entelechy, simple substance)\nsucceeded in finding satisfying answers to this and related questions,\nin the early modern era these disputes shaped the conception of what\nthe object of metaphysics (metaphysica generalis sive\nontologia) was supposed to be.\n",
