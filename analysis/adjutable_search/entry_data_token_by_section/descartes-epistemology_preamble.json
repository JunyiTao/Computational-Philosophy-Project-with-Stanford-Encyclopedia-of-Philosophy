    "main_text": "\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) is widely regarded as a key\nfigure in the founding of modern philosophy. His noteworthy\ncontributions extend to mathematics and physics. This entry focuses on\nhis philosophical contributions to the theory of\nknowledge. Specifically, the focus is on the epistemological project\nof his famous work, Meditations on First\nPhilosophy. Descartes circulated the Meditations to\nother philosophers for objections and comments, then responding with\ndetailed replies that provide a rich source of further information\nabout the original work. Indeed, six sets of objections and replies\nwere published along with the first edition of the\nMeditations (1641), and a seventh set was added with the second edition (1642).\n",
