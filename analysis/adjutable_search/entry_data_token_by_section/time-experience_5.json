    "main_text": "Time order\n6. Time order\n\nHow do we perceive precedence amongst events? A temptingly simple\nanswer is that the perception of precedence is just a sensation caused\nby instances of precedence, just as a sensation of red is caused by\ninstances of redness. Hugh Mellor (1998), who considers this line,\nrejects it for the following reason. If this were the correct\nexplanation, then we could not distinguish between x being\nearlier than y, and x being later\nthan y, for whenever there is an instance of one relation,\nthere is also an instance of the other. But plainly we are able to\ndistinguish the two cases, so it cannot simply be a matter of\nperceiving a relation, but something to do with our perception of the\nrelata. But mere perception of the relata cannot be all there is to\nperceiving precedence. Consider again Broad\u2019s point about the\nsecond hand and the hour hand. We first perceive the hour hand in one\nposition, say pointing to 3 o\u2019clock, and later we perceive it in\na different position, pointing to half-past 3. So I have two\nperceptions, one later than the other. I may also be aware of the\ntemporal relationship of the two positions of the hand. Nevertheless,\nI do not perceive that relationship, in that I do not see the hand\nmoving. In contrast, I do see the second hand move from one position\nto another: I see the successive positions as successive.\n\nMellor\u2019s proposal is that I perceive x precede\ny by virtue of the fact that my perception of x\ncausally affects my perception of y. As I see the second hand\nin one position, I have in my short-term memory an image (or\ninformation in some form) of its immediately previous position, and\nthis image affects my current perception. The result is a perception\nof movement. The perceived order of different positions need not\nnecessarily be the same as the actual temporal order of those\npositions, but it will be the same as the causal order of the\nperceptions of them. Since causes always precede their\neffects, the temporal order perceived entails a corresponding temporal\norder in the perceptions. Dainton (2001) has objected to this that, if\nthe account were right, we should not be able to remember perceiving\nprecedence, since we only remember what we can genuinely perceive. But\nthere seems no reason to deny that, just because perception of\nprecedence may involve short-term memory, it does not thereby count as\ngenuine perception.\n\nThere is a further disanalogy between perception of colour and\nperception of time order. What is perceived in the case of colour is\nsomething that has a definite spatio-temporal location. The relation\nof precedence, in contrast, is not something that has any obvious\nlocation. But causes do have locations, so the perception of\nprecedence is rather harder to reconcile with the causal theory of\nperception than the perception of colour (Le Poidevin 2004, 2007).\n\nIn effect, Mellor\u2019s idea is that the brain represents time by\nmeans of time: that temporally ordered events are represented by\nsimilarly temporally ordered experiences. This would make the\nrepresentation of time unique. (For example, the brain does not\nrepresent spatially separated objects by means of spatially separated\nperceptions, or orange things by orange perceptions.) But why should\ntime be unique in this respect? In other media, time can be\nrepresented spatially (as in cartoons, graphs, and analogue clocks) or\nnumerically (as in calendars and digital clocks). So perhaps the brain\ncan represent time by other means. One reason to suppose that it must\nhave other means at its disposal is that time needs to be represented\nin memory (I recall, both that a was earlier than\nb, and also the experience of seeing a occur before b) and\nintention (I intend to F after I G), but\nthere is no obvious way in which Mellor\u2019s \u2018representation\nof time by time\u2019 account can be extended to these.\n\nOn Mellor\u2019s model, the mechanism by which time-order is\nperceived is sensitive to the time at which perceptions\noccur, but indifferent to their content (what the perceptions\nare of). Daniel Dennett (1991) proposes a different model, on which\nthe process is time-independent, but content-sensitive. For example,\nthe brain may infer the temporal order of events by seeing which\nsequence makes sense of the causal order of those events. One of the\nadvantages of Dennett\u2019s model is that it can account for the\nrather puzzling cases of \u2018backwards time referral\u2019, where\nperceived order does not follow the order of perceptions. (See Dennett\n1991 for a discussion of these cases, and also Roache 1999 for an\nattempt to reconcile them with Mellor\u2019s account.)\n",
