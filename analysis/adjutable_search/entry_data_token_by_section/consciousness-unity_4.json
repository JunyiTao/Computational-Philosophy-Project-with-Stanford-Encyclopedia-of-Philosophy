    "main_text": "Is Consciousness Unified?\n3. Is Consciousness Unified?\n\nNow that we know what we are talking about when we talk about unified\nconsciousness, the next question to ask is: Does it exist?\nDoes consciousness have the properties that it would need to\nhave to be unified? If this division of questions looks peculiar,\nnotice that it can apply to Santa Claus, too. We can develop an\naccount of what Santa Claus would be like without committing ourselves\non the question of whether such a being exists. However, the division\nmay look peculiar in another way: How could anyone deny that\nconsciousness is unified? That it is seems just obvious. In fact,\nthere has been a good deal of skepticism on the matter.\n\nSome will urge that before we ask whether unified consciousness\nexists, we should first ask, Does consciousness exist? There\nnow seems to be a wide consensus that the answer to this question is,\nYes, there is in us something appropriately called\n\u2018consciousness\u2019. Even those who hold that the\nlong-standing idea that\n intentionality (see entry)\n is a matter of attitudes to propositions is false and ripe for\nelimination, Paul and Patricia Churchland for example, allow that\nconsciousness exists, though they urge that the concept be trimmed a\nbit (see, for example, Patricia Churchland 1983). Some writers have\ntaken Dennett (1991) to deny that consciousness exists, either\ndirectly or by implication. He himself has said repeatedly that\nconsciousness is real, however (1995: 135, 146 are two\nexamples). A few writers, Wilkes (1984) and Rey (1988) for example,\nhave espoused true eliminativist about consciousness but they are a\ntiny minority. \n",
