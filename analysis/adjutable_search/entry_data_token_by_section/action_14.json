    "main_text": "The Ontology of Actions || Events, processes, and more\n5.1 Events, processes, and more\n\nThere are several reasons to categorize actions as events. A central\none concerns their connection to causation (Davidson 1967a; Goldman\n1970). Actions are directly implicated in causal relations: modifying\nDavidson\u2019s example (pp.4\u20135), the burglar\u2019s entering my\nhouse might cause me to turn on the light, which in turn might cause\nhim to be startled. On the widespread assumption that events are the\nprimary causal relata, it would follow that actions, such as my\nturning on of the light, are events.\n\nAnother argument for the event view is that it explains common\ninference patterns. As Davidson (1967b) noted, sentences attributing\nactions to agents admit of adjectival drop. Thus, a sentence like (3)\nentails (4), which in turn entails (5):\n\n(3)\nDonald buttered the toast in the bathroom at 12am.\n(4)\nDonald buttered the toast in the bathroom.\n(5)\nDonald buttered the toast.\n\n\nDavidson suggested that the best way to account for these inferential\nrelations is to assume that at the level of logical form these\nsentences quantify over events. So understood, the logical form of\n(3)\u2013(5) would be as\n follows:[6]\n\n(3*)\n\\(\\exists x(\\textrm{Buttering}(x) \\amp \\textrm{By}(x,\n\\textrm{Donald}) \\amp \\textrm{Object}(x, \\textrm{toast})\\ \\amp \\)\n\\(\\textrm{Location}(x, \\textrm{bathroom}) \\amp \\textrm{Time}(x,\n\\textrm{12am}))\\)\n(4*)\n\\(\\exists x(\\textrm{Buttering}(x) \\amp \\textrm{By}(x,\n\\textrm{Donald}) \\amp \\textrm{Object}(x, \\textrm{toast})\\ \\amp\\)\n\\(\\textrm{Location}(x, \\textrm{bathroom}))\\)\n(5*)\n\\(\\exists x(\\textrm{Buttering}(x) \\amp \\textrm{By}(x,\n\\textrm{Donald}) \\amp \\textrm{Object}(x, \\textrm{toast}))\\)\n\n\nThe entailment relations are then easily explained through the\nclassical rules for conjunction and existential quantification. This\nanalysis, which has been highly influential in formal semantics,\nappears to entail that actions are events, entities with a\nspatiotemporal location (since they admit of spatiotemporal\nmodifiers), that possess the properties denoted by adverbial modifiers\n(such as who was engaged in them, or what the object of the action\nwas).\n\nFinally, perhaps the most straightforward reason to hold that actions\nare events, is that this fits naturally with the way we speak about\nthem. For instance, we say, \u201cThe event we observed last night\nturned out to be a theft\u201d, or \u201cThe murder of that woman\nwas a sad event\u201d.\n\nAgainst this view, a number of scholars have recently argued that\nactions (in the sense of concern for philosophy of action) are instead\nprocesses (Mourelatos 1978; Stout 1997; Hornsby 2012; Steward\n2012; Charles 2018). To understand this claim, we first need to\nexplain what the distinction amounts to. We can introduce it at an\nintuitive level in terms of the aspectual distinction between the\nfollowing two sentences:\n\n(6)\nDonald is buttering the toast.\n(7)\nDonald has buttered the toast.\n\n\n(6) refers to an ongoing occurrence in the midst of development. As\nsuch, many of its properties are still indeterminate and may change\nover time. It may be happening in the bathroom in a matter of seconds\nif Donald stays there; but he could take a break, forget about it, and\ncontinue on with it several minutes later in the kitchen. Moreover,\nthe manner in which it takes place can change as it occurs: it may\nspeed up (if Donald is suddenly in a hurry) or slow down (if Donald is\ndistracted by a noise), and he may start doing it more mindfully, or\ndistractedly. Indeed, however Donald is doing the buttering,\nit may happen that he never ends up having buttered the toast\n(a nearby scream might cause him to drop it in the toilet halfway\nthrough). This is sometimes called the \u201cimperfective\nparadox\u201d: in general, \u231cx is \u03c6-ing\u231d does\nnot entail \u231cx has \u03c6\u2019d\u231d. By contrast, the event\nitself, denoted by (7), cannot speed up or slow down, nor change the\nmanner in which it is done, since it is already complete. This is why\nit has a determinate temporal-spatial location in terms of which some\nhave sought to individuate it (Lemmon 1967; Quine 1985; Davidson\n1985). By contrast, processes do not have an essential\ntemporal-spatial location: the same process of buttering that is now\ntaking place at 12:01 could culminate in a minute or in an hour.\n\nThe most straightforward reason to think that actions are processes is\nthat actions appear to have these properties, as is indicated by the\nexamples used in the previous paragraph (Stout 1997; Steward 2012;\nCharles 2015; 2018). Thus, one\u2019s action can speed up or slow\ndown, be done in one way or another at different times in its history,\nand may culminate at different times. Indeed, an ongoing action may\nnever be completed.\n\nThe connection between imperfective aspect and processes provides\nfurther impetus for the view that actions are processes (the argument\nto follow is based on Michael Thompson\u2019s ideas (2008,\n122\u201330), though he rejects the view that actions are processes,\nunderstood as particulars (pp.134\u20137)). After all, it seems essential\nto actions that they can enter into rationalizing explanations\n(Anscombe 1957; Thompson 2008; Wiland 2013; Ford 2015; 2017), and such\nexplanations can easily be given in imperfective language. To see\nthis, consider again Anscombe\u2019s case of a man who operates a\nlever to pump poisoned water to a house, with the plan of killing the\ninhabitants (Anscombe 1957, \u00a723). We could represent his thoughts\nas follows: \u201cI am moving the lever up and down because\nI am pumping water to the house because I am poisoning its\ninhabitants.\u201d Indeed, such formulations seem to express\ncanonical answers to Anscombe\u2019s special question\n\u201cWhy?\u201d (Thompson 2008; Wiland 2013; Ford 2015). However,\nwe cannot capture the same thoughts without imperfective expressions\n(Thompson 2008). The train of thought that goes, \u201cI have moved\nthe lever up and down because I have pumped the water\nbecause I have poisoned the inhabitants of the house\u201d\nmakes it sound like the man is acting on a conditional promise to move\nthe lever if the men are killed by his hand. This suggests that\nwhereas processes can directly enter into the kinds of rationalizing\nexplanations definitive of intentional action, events cannot (except,\nperhaps, derivatively), which in turn suggests that actions are\nprocesses.\n\nFinally, it has been suggested that the process view can better\naccommodate the type of direct guidance that Frankfurt identified as\nessential to intentional action (see above, section 2.4). It seems\nattractive to explain the nature of this direct guidance in terms of\nhow substances in general cause changes by engaging in certain\nprocesses (Hornsby 2012), or in terms of the different ways in which\nan agent can manifest her agency in a process (slower, faster, more or\nless skillfully) (Charles 2018). And, as Steward (2012) suggests, this\nmight give a substantial role to the agent in the explanation of\naction. By contrast, since events have settled natures and\nspatial-temporal properties, it seems that the agent can at best\ninteract with them in the indirect way in which she interacts with\nother objects, such as a car.\n\nIt is only recently that an alternative to the event view has been\nclearly formulated and defended. As such, much work remains to be done\nin this area, and even among defenders of the process view there are\nimportant disagreements. One important disagreement is over whether\nprocesses are particulars (Galton 2006; Steward 2012; Charles 2018) or\nnot (Stout 1997; Crowther 2011; Hornsby 2012; Crowther 2018; cf.\nThompson 2008). Another disagreement is about whether a unique thing\nis a process and an event (at different times) (Steward 2012; Charles\n2018), or whether the process and the event are distinct things (Stout\n1997; Crowther 2011; Hornsby 2012; Charles 2015; Crowther 2018).\n\nRegardless of how these questions are answered, a remaining challenge\nis to explain the unity between processes and events, the\nfact that there is a non-accidental connection between the process of\nbuttering, and the event of one\u2019s having buttered the toast that\nresults if the action is successful (Haase 2022). Moreover, it is\nworth noting that although the process-view is the most important\nalternative available to the events-view, other proposals have been\nadvanced recently, including the view that actions are thoughts\n(R\u00f6dl 2007; 2011; Marcus 2012; Valaris 2020). For example, Marcus\nholds that to act intentionally just is to judge that the action is to\nbe done.\n",
