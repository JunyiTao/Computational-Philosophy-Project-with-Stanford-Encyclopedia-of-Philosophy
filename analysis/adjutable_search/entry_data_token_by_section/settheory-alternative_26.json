    "main_text": "Small Set Theories || Vopenka\u2019s alternative set theory\n9.2 Vopenka\u2019s alternative set theory\n\nPetr Vopenka has presented the following alternative set\ntheory (1979).\n\nThe theory has sets and classes. The following axioms hold of\nsets.\n\n\nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are the\nsame.\n\nEmpty set: \\(\\varnothing\\) exists.\n\nSuccessor: For any sets \\(x\\) and \\(y, x \\cup \\{y\\}\\)\nexists.\n\nInduction: Every formula \\(\\phi\\) expressed in the\nlanguage of sets only (all parameters are sets and all quantifiers are\nrestricted to sets) and true of \\(\\varnothing\\) and true of \\(x \\cup\n\\{y\\}\\) if it is true of \\(x\\) is true of all sets.\n\nRegularity: Every set has an element disjoint from\nit.\n\n\nThe theory of sets appears to be the theory of \\(V_{\\omega}\\) (the\nhereditarily finite sets) in the usual set theory!\n\nWe now pass to consideration of classes.\n\n\nExistence of classes: If \\(\\phi(x)\\) is any formula,\nthen the class \\(\\phi(x)\\) of all sets \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nexists. (The set \\(x\\) is identified with the class of elements of\n\\(x\\).) Note that Kuratowski pairs of sets are sets, and so we can\ndefine (class) relations and functions on the universe of sets much as\nusual.\n\nExtensionality for classes: Classes with the same\nelements are equal.\n\nDefinition: A semiset is a subclass of a\nset. A proper class is a class which is not a set. A\nproper semiset is a subclass of a set which is not a set.\n\nAxiom of proper semisets: There is a proper\nsemiset.\n\n\nA proper semiset is a signal that the set which contains it is\nnonstandard (recall that all sets seem to be hereditarily\nfinite!)\n\n\nDefinition: A set is finite iff all of its\nsubclasses are sets.\n\n\nA finite set has standard size (the use of \u201cfinite\u201d here\ncould be confusing: all sets are nonstandard finite here,\nafter all).\n\n\nDefinition: An ordering of type \\(\\omega\\) is a class\nwell-ordering which is infinite and all of whose initial segments are\nfinite. A class is countable if it has an ordering of type\n\\(\\omega\\).\n\n\nAn ordering of type \\(\\omega\\) has the same length as the\nstandard natural numbers. We can prove that there is such an\nordering: consider the order on the finite (i.e., standard finite) von\nNeumann ordinals. There must be infinite von Neumann ordinals because\nthere is a set theoretically definable bijection between the von\nNeumann ordinals and the whole universe of sets: any proper semiset\ncan be converted to a proper semiset of a set of von Neumann\nordinals.\n\n\nProlongation axiom: Each countable function \\(F\\) can\nbe extended to a set function.\n\n\nThe Prolongation Axiom has a role similar to that of the\nStandardization Axiom in the \u201cnonstandard\u201d set theory\nIST above.\n\nVopenka considers representations of superclasses of classes using\nrelations on sets. A class relation \\(R\\) on a class \\(A\\) is said to\ncode the superclass of inverse images of elements of \\(A\\) under\n\\(R\\). A class relation \\(R\\) on a class \\(A\\) is said to\nextensionally code this superclass if distinct elements of \\(A\\) have\ndistinct preimages. He \u201ctidies up\u201d the theory of such\ncodings by adopting the\n\n\nAxiom of extensional coding: Every collection of\nclasses which is codable is extensionally codable.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this can be phrased in a way which makes no\nreference to superclasses: for any class relation \\(R\\), there is a\nclass relation \\(R'\\) such that for any \\(x\\) there is \\(x'\\) with\npreimage under \\(R'\\) equal to the preimage of \\(x\\) under \\(R\\), and\ndistinct elements of the field of \\(R'\\) have distinct preimages.\n\nHis notion of coding is more general: we can further code collections\nof classes by taking a pair \\(\\langle K, R\\rangle\\) where \\(K\\) is a\nsubclass of the field of \\(R\\); clearly any collection of classes\ncodable in this way can be extensionally coded by using the axiom in\nthe form we give.\n\nThe final axiom is\n\n\nAxiom of cardinalities: If two classes are\nuncountable, they are the same size.\n\n\nThis implies (as in pocket set theory) that there are two infinite\ncardinalities, which can be thought of as \\(\\aleph_0\\) and \\(c\\),\nthough in this context their behavior is less familiar than it is in\npocket set theory. For example, the set of all natural numbers (as\nVopenka defines it) is of cardinality \\(c\\), while there is an initial\nsegment of the natural numbers (the finite natural numbers) which has\nthe expected cardinality \\(\\omega\\).\n\nOne gets the axiom of choice from the axioms of cardinalities and\nextensional codings; the details are technical. One might think that\nthis would go as in pocket set theory: the order type of all the\nordinals is not a set and so has the same cardinality as the universe.\nBut this doesn\u2019t work here, because the \u201cordinals\u201d\nin the obvious sense are all nonstandard finite ordinals, which, from\na class standpoint, are not well-ordered at all. However, there is a\ndevious way to code an uncountable well-ordering using the axiom of\nextensional coding, and since its domain is uncountable it must be the\nsame size as the universe.\n\nThis is a rather difficult theory. A model of the alternative set\ntheory in the usual set theory is a nonstandard model of\n\\(V_{\\omega}\\) of size \\(\\omega_1\\) in which every countable external\nfunction extends to a function in the model. It might be best to\nsuppose that this model is constructed inside \\(L\\) (the constructible\nuniverse) so that the axiom of cardinalities will be satisfied. The\naxiom of extensional coding follows from Choice in the ambient set\ntheory.\n\nThe constructions of the natural numbers and the real numbers with\nwhich we started go much as usual, except that we get two kinds of\nnatural numbers (the finite von Neumann ordinals in the set universe\n(nonstandard), and the finite von Neumann set ordinals\n(standard)). The classical reals can be defined as Dedekind cuts in\nthe standard rationals; these are not sets, but any real can then be\napproximated by a nonstandard rational. One can proceed to do analysis\nwith some (but not quite all) of the tools of the usual nonstandard\nanalysis.\n",
