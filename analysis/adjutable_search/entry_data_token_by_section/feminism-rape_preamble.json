    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough the proper definition of \u2018rape\u2019 is itself a\nmatter of some dispute, rape is generally understood to involve sexual\npenetration of a person by force and/or without that person\u2019s\nconsent. Rape is committed overwhelmingly by men and boys, usually\nagainst women and girls, and sometimes against other men and boys.\n(For the most part, this entry will assume male perpetrators and\nfemale victims.)\n\nVirtually all feminists agree that rape is a grave wrong, one too\noften ignored, mischaracterized, and legitimized. Feminists differ,\nhowever, about how the crime of rape is best understood, and about how\nrape should be combated both legally and socially.\n",
