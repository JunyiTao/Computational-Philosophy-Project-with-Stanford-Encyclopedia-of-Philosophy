Constructive logic in that sense was\na success, and (with a different meaning) it became fundamental to\nHilbert\u2019s Program as well. On the other hand, phenomena specific\nto Brouwer\u2019s full conception of logic, in particular the strong\ncounterexamples, played no role in the Foundational Debate whatsoever.\nThe main reason for this may be that, in their dependence on choice\nsequences, they use objects that are not acceptable in classical\nmathematics. (A more subtle matter is whether they are acceptable in\nHilbert\u2019s finitary mathematics. According to Bernays, Hilbert\nnever took a position on choice sequences (G\u00f6del 2003a: 279), and\nmore generally never read Brouwer\u2019s papers (van Dalen 2005:\n 637).[15])\n In addition, Brouwer did not announce the existence of strong\ncounterexamples in a loud or polemical way; and when in 1954 he\nfinally did publish (in English) a paper with a polemical\ntitle\u2014\u201cAn example of contradictority in classical theory\nof functions\u201d\u2014the Foundational Debate was, in the social\nsense, long over. Intuitionistic logic and mathematics had been widely\naccepted to the extent that they could be seen as the constructive\npart of classical mathematics, while the typically intuitionistic\ninnovations were ignored. It is not surprising, then, that the\npresentation of the strong counterexamples in the 1950s did not at all\nlead to a reopening of the debate. For further discussion of this\nmatter, see Hesseling 2003 and van Atten 2004a.\n",
