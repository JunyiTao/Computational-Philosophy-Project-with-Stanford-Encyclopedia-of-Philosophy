    "main_text": "Modified Versions of the Correspondence Theory || Relocating Correspondence\n7.3 Relocating Correspondence\n\n\nDefinitions like (1) and (2) from Section 3 assume, naturally, that\ntruthbearers are true because they, the truthbearers themselves,\ncorrespond to facts. There are however views that reject this natural\nassumption. They propose to account for the truth of truthbearers of\ncertain kinds, propositions, not by way of their\ncorrespondence to facts, but by way of the correspondence to facts of\nother items, the ones that have propositions as their\ncontents. Consider the state of believing that p (or the\nactivity of judging that p). The state (the\nactivity) is not, strictly speaking, true or false; rather, what is\ntrue or false is its content, the proposition\nthat p. Nevertheless, on the present view, it is the state of\nbelieving that p that corresponds or fails to correspond to a\nfact. So truth/falsehood for propositions can be defined in the\nfollowing manner: x is a true/false proposition iff there is\na belief state B such that x is the content\nof B and B corresponds/fails to correspond to a\nfact.\n\n\nSuch a modification of fact-based correspondence can be found in Moore\n(1927, p. 83) and Armstrong (1973, 4.iv & 9). It can be adapted to\natomistic (Armstrong) and subatomistic views, and to views on which\nsentences (of the language of thought) are the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsehood. However, by taking the content-carrying states as\nthe primary corresponders, it entails that there are no\ntruths/falsehoods that are not believed by someone. Most advocates of\npropositions as primary bearers of truth and falsehood will regard\nthis as a serious weakness, holding that there are very many true and\nfalse propositions that are not believed, or even entertained, by\nanyone. Armstrong (1973) combines the view with an instrumentalist\nattitude towards propositions, on which propositions are mere\nabstractions from mental states and should not be taken seriously,\nontologically speaking.\n",
