    "main_text": "\n\nManipulability theories of causation, according to which causes are to\nbe regarded as handles or devices for manipulating effects, have\nconsiderable intuitive appeal and are popular among many scientists\nand statisticians. This article surveys several prominent versions of\nsuch theories advocated by philosophers, and the many difficulties\nthey face. Until recently, philosophical statements of the\nmanipulationist approach have generally been reductionist in\naspiration and have assigned a central role to human action. These\ncontrast with more recent discussions employing a broadly\nmanipulationist framework for understanding causation, such as those\ndue to the computer scientist Judea Pearl and others, which are\nnon-reductionist and rely instead on the notion of an intervention.\nThis is simply an appropriately exogenous causal process; it has no\nessential connection with human action. This interventionist framework\nmanages to avoid at least some of these difficulties faced by\ntraditional philosophical versions of the manipulability theory and\nhelps to clarify the content of causal claims.\n",
