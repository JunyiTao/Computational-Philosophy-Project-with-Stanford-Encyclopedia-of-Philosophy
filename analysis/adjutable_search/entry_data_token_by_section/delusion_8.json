    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches to Delusion || Neuropsychological and psychodynamic accounts of delusion\n3.1 Neuropsychological and psychodynamic accounts of delusion\n\nAccording to psychodynamic accounts, no\nneurobiological deficits are needed in the explanation of how delusions are\nformed. Rather, delusions are caused by motivational factors. For\ninstance, delusions of persecution would be developed in order to\nprotect us from low self-esteem and depression, and would be due to\nthe attribution of negative events to some malevolent other rather\nthan to ourselves. The delusion would be part of a defense\nmechanism. Other delusions, such as Capgras, have also received a\npsychodynamic interpretation: a young woman believes that her father\nhas been replaced by a stranger looking just like him in order to make\nher sexual desire for him less socially objectionable. In this way,\nthe delusion would have the function to reduce anxiety and sense of\nguilt. Psychodynamic accounts of the Capgras delusion have been\nstrongly criticized on the basis of recent findings about the type of\nbrain damage that characterizes Capgras, affecting the\nface recognition system. For delusions that are supposed to play a\ndefensive or self-enhancing role (e.g., persecution, anosognosia, and\nerotomania), psychodynamic accounts or hybrid accounts featuring a\ncombination of neurobiological and motivational factors are very\npopular.\n\nNeuropsychological accounts of delusions offer very satisfactory\naccounts of some delusions, as one can often identify with some\nprecision the damaged region of the brain and the causal link between\nthe damage and its psychological manifestations, culminating with the\nformation of the delusion. Neuropsychological accounts of other\ndelusions \u2013 once regarded as \u2018functional\u2019 \u2013\nare also being developed and explored. For some delusions, hybrid\naccounts have been proposed, where a combination of different factors\n(including motivation) significantly contribute to the formation of\nthe delusion (e.g. McKay et al. 2007). One such case seems to\nbe the Reverse Othello Syndrome, the delusion that a romantic partner\nis still faithful to us when this is no longer the case. The belief\ncan be regarded as a defense against the suffering that the\nacknowledgement of the infidelity of our partner would cause (see\nexample in Butler 2000 as cited and discussed by McKay et al.\n2005a, p. 313). \n3.2 One-factor, two-factor, and prediction-error theories of delusion formation\n\nAccording to popular neuropsychological accounts, delusions are the\nresult of an unusual perceptual experience (Maher 1974); an unusual\nexperience accompanied by reasoning biases (Garety and Freeman 1999;\nGarety et al. 2001; McKay 2012); a breakdown of certain\naspects of perception and cognition including a deficit in hypothesis\nor belief evaluation (Langdon and Coltheart 2000, Coltheart et\nal. 2010); or a failure of predictive coding (Fletcher and Frith\n2009; Corlett et al. 2010). \n\nFor some one-factor theorists (Maher 1974), the delusion is a\nreasonable hypothesis given the strangeness of the\nexperience, or the strange experience is in a sensory modality or at a\nprocessing stage where further reality testing is not available (Hohwy\nand Rosenberg 2005). But other one-factor theorists (e.g. Gerrans\n2002a) argue that, although it may be reasonable at first to\narticulate a delusional hypothesis to explain unusual experience, it\nis not rational to maintain the delusional hypothesis in the face of\ncounterevidence. Recent defences of the one-factor theory have\nemphasised that cognitive features in people who develop delusional\nbeliefs are within the normal range and there is no need to postulate\nany reasoning deficit to explain delusion formation (Sullivan-Bissett\n2018, 2020).\n\nFor two-factor theorists (Davies et al. 2001; Stone and Young\n1997), the delusion is formed in order to explain a puzzling\nexperience or a failed prediction, but the presence of the experience\nor the failed prediction is not sufficient for the formation of the\ndelusion. The mechanism responsible for the formulation of the\ndelusional hypothesis must be affected by reasoning biases or\nreasoning deficits. Developments of this theory have been offered by\nAimola Davies and Davies 2009, by Coltheart et al. 2010, by\nMcKay 2012, and by Davies and Egan 2013.\n\nIn the two-factor theory framework, an unusual event is responsible\nfor the formation of the delusion. The young woman who thinks that her\nfather has been replaced by an impostor would form this belief because\nshe has reduced autonomic response to familiar faces (factor 1), and\nthis affects her capacity to recognize the face of the man in front of\nher as her father\u2019s face, even if she can judge that the face is\nidentical (or virtually identical) to that of her father. But this\nunusual event (due to a reduction of autonomic response) is not the\nonly factor responsible for the formation of the Capgras delusion. In\norder to explain why the thought that a dear one has been replaced by\nan impostor is adopted as a plausible explanation of the unusual\nevent, a factor 2 is required, and this can be deficit at the level of\nhypothesis evaluation (Coltheart 2007), or the presence of exaggerated\nattributional or data-gathering biases, such as the tendency to\n\u2018jump to conclusion\u2019 on the basis of limited evidence\n(Garety and Freeman 1999). In a more recent version of the two-factor\nmodel, the problem is no longer identified with the adoption of the\ndelusional belief, which is described as the best explanation for the\nunusual event. Rather, the problem lies with failing to give up the\ndelusional belief in the face of overwhelming counterevidence after\nits adoption (Coltheart et al. 2010).\n\nIn another version of the two-factor theory (McKay 2012), the young\nwoman adopts the impostor hypothesis because she suffers from a\nneuropsychological impairment responsible for the unusual event\n(factor 1) resulting in the anomalous experience. But the unusual\nevent is not the only factor responsible for the formation of the\ndelusion. The young woman also has a bias towards explanatory adequacy\n(factor 2) which leads her to accept a hypothesis that matches her\nunusual experience even when such hypothesis has a low prior\nprobability and conflicts with some of her existing beliefs. The\nCapgras delusion is adopted because the delusional hypothesis explains\n(\u2018fits\u2019) the data, that is, the absence of a feeling of\nfamiliarity towards a face that should be well-known.\n\nAccording to a delusion formation theory inspired by predictive\ncoding, we form expectations about our experience in line with a\ngeneral model of how the world is. Greater attention is paid to those\nevents which defy expectations, as they might require a revision of\nour model of the world, the one we have adopted up to that point. The\ndiscrepancy between what we expect and the information we take in is\nan important part of the way learning occurs. When our expectations\nare not met, a prediction error is coded, and our model of the world\nis updated accordingly. A prediction-error signal is disrupted when\nevents invested of special significance (in psychosis this may be due\nto dopamine dysregulation) cause us to update our current beliefs\nabout reality, which happen to be correct. The woman who sees her\nfather and does not get the usual autonomic response experiences an\nunexpected event which gives rise to a prediction error. The reaction\nto the signal is an attempt to explain the unexpected event\n(\u2018This is not my father!\u2019). This results in the formation\nof a delusion (Corlett et al. 2007) where the formation of\nthe delusion is principally an \u201cerror of learning\u201d (Fine and Corlett\n2016).\n\nSome hybrid explanations of delusion formation have been proposed (see\ne.g. Galbraith 2014), for instance combining insights from the\ntwo-factor theory and the predictive coding account (e.g., Miyazono\nand McKay 2019).\n3.3 Bottom-up versus top-down theories of delusion\n\nAnother distinction, introduced and developed in the philosophical\nliterature on delusions, is between bottom-up and\ntop-down theories, where these labels are meant to refer to\nthe direction of the causal relation between experience and belief in\nthe formation of the delusion. Bottom-up theorists argue that the\ndirection of causal explanation is from the experience to the belief.\nTop-down theorists argue that the direction of causal explanation is\nfrom the belief to the experience. Notice that not everybody finds the\ndistinction useful. For instance, Hohwy and Rosenberg (2005) and Hohwy\n(2004) argue that the distinction loses its appeal in the framework\nproposed by prediction-error theorists given that delusion formation\ninvolves both bottom-up and top-down processes. Our prior expectations\naffect the way in which the perceptual signals are processed and give\nrise to unusual experiences. Then, the unusual experiences go through\nreality testing and are subject to further interpretation, after which\nthey become a central factor in the formation of the delusional\nbelief.\n\nFor bottom-up theorists, delusions involve modifications of the belief\nsystem that are caused by \u2018strange experiences\u2019 due to\norganic malfunction (Bayne and Pacherie 2004a; Davies et al.\n2001). For instance, I experience people watching me with suspicion or\nhostility, and as a result I form the hypothesis that they intend to\ncause me harm; or something does not feel right when I see my\nsister\u2019s face, and as a result I come to believe that the person\nI am looking at is not really my sister but an impostor.\n\nThe proximal cause of the delusional belief is a certain highly\nunusual experience (Bayne and Pacherie 2004a, p. 2).\n\n\nWhat would top-down theorists say about the same examples? I believe\nthat people want to harm me, and as a result I perceive them as\nlooking at me malevolently; or I believe that someone looking almost\nidentical to my sister has replaced her, and as a result the person\nclaiming to be my sister doesn\u2019t look to me as my sister does.\nThe top-down thesis about delusion formation has been proposed\nespecially for monothematic delusions such as Capgras (Campbell 2001;\nEilan 2000) and for delusions of passivity, when people report that\nthere are external influences on their thoughts and actions (Sass\n1994; Graham and Stephens 1994; Stephens and Graham 2000).\n\n[D]elusion is a matter of top-down disturbance in some fundamental\nbeliefs of the subject, which may consequently affect experiences and\nactions (Campbell 2001, p. 89).\n\n\nBoth bottom-up and top-down theories face challenges: whereas top-down\ntheorists need to account for where the belief comes from, and why it\nis so successful in affecting perceptual experiences, bottom-up\ntheorists are pressed to explain why people tend to endorse a bizarre\nhypothesis to explain their unusual experiences, given that hypotheses\nwith higher probability should be available to them.\n\nWithin the bottom-up camp, further divisions apply. For some, it is\ncorrect to say that the delusional belief explains the\nexperience. Others claim that the delusional belief is an\nendorsement of the experience. According to the explanationist\naccount (Maher 1999; Stone and Young 1997), the content of experience\nis vaguer than the content of the delusion, and the delusion plays the\nrole of one potential explanation for the experience. For instance, in\nthe Capgras delusion, the young woman\u2019s experience would be that\nof someone looking very much like her father but not being her father.\nThe delusion would be an explanation of the fact that the man looks\nlike her father, but his face feels strange to her: the man must be an\nimpostor. In persecution, the experience would be that of people\nbehaving with hostility towards us, and the delusion would be an\nexplanation why they behave with hostility: they intend to cause us\nharm. This account leaves it open that the same experience could be\nexplained differently (i.e., without any appeal to the delusional\nhypothesis).\n\nAccording to the rival account, the endorsement account (Bayne and\nPacherie 2004a; Pacherie et al. 2006; Bongiorno 2019), the\ncontent of the experience is already as conceptually rich as the\ncontent of the delusion. The delusion is not an explanation of the\nexperience, but an endorsement of it, a way of taking the experience\nat face value: the content of the experience is taken as veridical and\nbelieved. In Capgras, the young woman\u2019s experience is that of a\nman looking very much like her father but being an impostor, and when\nthe experience is endorsed, it becomes the delusional belief that her\nfather has been replaced by an impostor. In persecution, our experience\nis that of people intending to cause us harm, and when it is endorsed,\nit becomes the delusional belief that those people intend to cause us\nharm.\n\nThere are further issues relevant to the debate between explanationism\nand endorsement theory, including whether for the person with the\ndelusion the unusual experience needs to be conscious and whether\nthere needs to be an inferential step between experience and belief\n(Bongiorno and Bortolotti 2019).\n4. Delusions and the Continuity Thesis\n\nThis section focuses on four debates that have animated the\nphilosophical literature on delusions in recent years. They can all be\nseen as attempts to examine the extent to which our delusions are\nmarkedly different from other beliefs we have and whether they can be\ndescribed as pathological in some sense.\n4.1 Are delusions irrational?\n\nThere is no doubt that the definitions of delusions in DSM-IV and\nDSM-5 characterise delusions as irrational beliefs. However, in the\nphilosophical literature on delusions, the status of delusions as\nirrational beliefs does not go unchallenged. Are delusions really\nirrational? If so, in what way?\n\nIn a number of influential papers Brendan Maher (1974, 1988, 1999,\n2003) argues that delusions are not ill-formed beliefs, and that there\nis nothing irrational in the relationship between the evidence\nsupporting the delusional hypothesis and the formation of such a\nhypothesis. According to Maher, the unusual nature of the delusion is due to the unusual nature of the experiences on the basis of\nwhich the delusion is formed. By reference to Maher\u2019s model,\nBlaney (1999) describes delusions as \u2018false but\nreasonable\u2019. Some difficulties have been identified with this\nstrategy. A first difficulty is that there seem to be people who\nsuffer from the same type of brain damage, and plausibly have the same\nexperience, as the people who develop the delusion, but do not accept\nany delusional hypotheses. How can these people avoid forming a\ndelusion? One possible answer is that those who have unusual\nexperiences and do not form the delusion have hypothesis-evaluation\nmechanisms that work efficiently, and thus end up rejecting hypotheses\nwith low probability and plausibility. But those who have unusual\nexperiences and do form the delusion are instead affected by an\nadditional problem, maybe a deficit at the level of hypothesis\nevaluation, which can be conceived as a failure of rationality.\n\nOn Maher\u2019s view, [\u2026] [i]t follows that anyone who has\nsuffered neuropsychological damage that reduces the affective response\nto faces should exhibit the Capgras delusion; anyone with a right\nhemisphere lesion that paralyzes the left limbs and leaves the subject\nwith a sense that the limbs are alien should deny ownership of the\nlimbs; anyone with a loss of the ability to interact fluently with\nmirrors should exhibit mirrored-self misidentification, and so on.\nHowever, these predictions from Maher\u2019s theory are clearly\nfalsified by examples from the neuropsychological literature (Davies\net al. 2001, p. 144).\n\n\nAnother difficulty with Maher\u2019s original account of delusions as\n\u2018false but reasonable\u2019 is that, even if the unusual nature\nof the experience were to satisfactorily explain the acceptance of the\ndelusional hypothesis and the formation of the delusion, this would\nnot be sufficient to guarantee that the behavior associated with having\ndelusions is overall rational. An explanation is needed for why\ndelusions are maintained in the face of counterevidence once the\ndelusional hypothesis has been formed and endorsed (see Gerrans\n2002a). One aspect of the notion of rationality for beliefs is that we\nare disposed to revise or abandon beliefs that seem to be in conflict\nwith the acquired evidence. The \u201cincorrigibility\u201d of\ndelusions speaks in favor of their being held\nirrationally.\n\nSo, one argument for the view that delusions are irrational comes from\nan examination of the relationship between the content of the delusion\nand the available evidence. Resistance to revising or abandoning the\ndelusion in the face of powerful counterevidence or counterargument is\na sign of irrationality: when we have delusions, we may ignore\nrelevant evidence or attempt to defend our delusional beliefs from\napparent objections with obvious confabulations. Often these attempts\nare deeply perplexing, and the reasons offered for believing the\ncontent of our delusions do not appear as be good reasons to others:\nin one of the examples of delusions offered at the start of this\nentry, a woman incorrectly believed that a man was in love with her\nand her evidence for that claim was that he was sending her secret\nlove messages hidden in the license plates on cars of a certain state.\nHowever, the notion that delusions fail to be responsive to evidence\nhas also been challenged: for instance, Flores 2021 convincingly\nargues that when we have delusions we have the capacity to respond to\nevidence that has a bearing on the content of the delusions, but other\nfactors contribute to the fact that we resist counterevidence, such as\nmotivational factors.\n\nOne reason why maintaining delusional beliefs may be seen as irrational\nis that the content of the delusions is often in tension with the\ncontent of our other beliefs, or with our behavior (Gerrans 2000, p.\n114 and Young 2000, p. 49) . That is, when a delusion is introduced\nand maintained within our belief system, it creates inconsistencies\nand does not always drive the actions we would expect given its\ncontent. Here are some examples. In the course of the same interview,\na woman may claim that her husband died four years earlier and was\ncremated and that her husband is a patient in the same hospital where\nshe is (Breen et al. 2000, p. 91). In Capgras delusion,\npeople may worry about the disappearance of their loved one, but also\nbe cooperative and even flirtatious with the alleged impostor (see\nLucchelli and Spinnler 2007). This suggests that delusions do not\nalways give rise to appropriate action (Bleuler 1950; Sass 2001),\nalthough they must be reported either spontaneously or after\nquestioning, or they could not be diagnosed as delusions. How can our\napparent strong conviction in the content of the delusion be squared\nwith our failure to act on it? One hypothesis is that the content of\nthe delusion is not genuinely believed. Another hypothesis is that we\ngenuinely believe the content of the delusion but do not convert it\ninto action, because we fail to acquire or maintain the motivation to\nact on the delusion. This would be consistent with negative symptoms\nof schizophrenia, as Bortolotti and Broome 2012 argue. \n\nOne should not be too impressed by evidence of \u2018behavioural\ninertia\u2019, however, as there are also\nmany examples in the literature of delusions driving action.\nAffected by perceptual delusional bicephaly, the delusion that one has\ntwo heads, a man who believed that the second head belonged to his\nwife\u2019s gynecologist attempted to attack it with an axe. When the\nattack failed he attempted it to shoot it down and as a result he was\nhospitalized with gunshot wounds (Ames 1984). Cases of Cotard delusion\nhave been reported where people stop eating and bathing themselves as\na consequence of believing that they are dead (Young and Leafhead\n1996).\n\nRelevant to the question whether delusions are rational, the empirical\nliterature suggests that our reasoning performance when we have\ndelusions reflects data-gathering and attribution biases. For\ninstance, it has been argued that people with delusions \u2018jump to\nconclusions\u2019; need less evidence to be convinced that a\nhypothesis is true (Garety 1991; Huq et al. 1988; Garety and\nFreeman 1999); and are more hasty in their decisions (Moritz and\nWoodward 2005; Fine et al. 2007). Other biases have also been\nnoted: people with delusions of persecution tend to attribute the\nresponsibility of negative events to other people (e.g., McKay et\nal. 2005b) whereas in the Cotard delusion there seems to be a\ntendency to attribute the responsibility of negative events to oneself\n(Young and Leafhead 1996; Gerrans 2000; McKay and Cipolotti 2007).\nPeople with delusions seem to be worse than controls at inhibiting the\nevidence of their senses when it conflicts with other things they know\n(Langdon et al. 2008b) and have an accentuated need for\nclosure which comprises a desire for clarity and structure (see\nKruglanski 1989, p. 14). These data are not by themselves sufficient\nto support the view that delusions are irrational, but show that we can \ndeviate from statistically normal reasoning performance when we have\ndelusions.\n\nA recent debate relevant to the rationality of delusions concerns the\nstep from unusual events to delusional beliefs. (This is primarily an\nissue that emerged among two-factor theorists, so the language used\nbelow is acceptable to them, but the problem can be reformulated in\nterms that are friendly to prediction-error theorists.) Coltheart\net al. 2010 argue that the step from unusual data to belief\nis an instance of abductive inference, as those who end up endorsing a\ndelusional belief need to select an explanatory hypothesis for their\nunusual data from a range of relevant hypotheses. Coltheart and\ncolleagues use the Bayesian model of abductive inference which invites\nus to ask two questions: Which hypothesis better explains the data?\nWhich hypothesis is the most plausible given what we already know? In\nthe case of delusions, they argue, it is reasonable to adopt the\ndelusional hypothesis given the data, and the good fit between\nhypothesis and data swamps general considerations about the overall\nimplausibility of the hypothesis. What may not be reasonable is the\nfact that people with delusions hang onto their delusions even when\nthey keep gathering evidence against it, that is, the delusional\nbelief is not correctly updated in the light of new information. The\nauthors argue that the information undermining the delusional\nhypothesis does not present itself as disconfirming evidence to the\nperson with the delusion. Thus, the new evidence is interpreted in the\nlight of the delusion and confabulation is used to fill the gaps. The\nbehaviour of the person with the delusion is not very different from\nthat of an obstinate scientist refusing to see that the new data\nundermines the support for the theory she is deeply committed to.\n\nMcKay 2012 offers some criticism of the account by Coltheart and\ncolleagues, and raises the following points among others: (1) it is\nnot a perfectly rational response to adopt the delusional hypothesis\nas an explanation for the unusual data, unless the probability of the\ndelusional hypothesis before the unusual data is gathered is very\nhigh, and this is implausible given the content of some delusional\nhypotheses (\u201cmy wife has been replaced by an almost identical\nimpostor\u201d); (2) factor two as described by Coltheart and\ncolleagues (i.e., a failure to update a belief in the light of\nconflicting evidence) cannot precede factor one or be acquired at the\nsame time as factor one, because such a form of conservatism would\nprevent the person from adopting the delusional hypothesis in the\nfirst place. McKay\u2019s positive account is that factor two is not\na bias towards conservatism (which causes new data conflicting with\nthe delusional hypothesis to be discounted), but a bias towards\nexplanatory adequacy (which causes the delusional hypothesis\nto be adopted and maintained because it fits the abnormal data so\nwell). McKay also argues that his account is compatible with\nprediction-error theories of delusion formation:\n\nAn excess of prediction error signal is what underpins the bias\ntowards explanatory adequacy. Prediction error signals are triggered\nby discrepancies between the data expected and the data encountered.\nSuch signals render salient the unexpected data and initiate a\nrevision of beliefs to accommodate these data. If there is an excess\nof prediction error signal, inappropriately heightened salience is\nattached to the data, and belief revision is excessively\naccommodatory \u2013 biased towards explanatory adequacy. (McKay 2012,\np. 18)\n\n\nThe debate is reviewed by Davies and Egan 2013 who helpfully focus on\nthe distinction between the adoption and the maintenance of the\ndelusional hypothesis and argue that there is no need to postulate an\nadditional reason why we hang on to our delusions (either a bias\ntowards conservatism or empirical adequacy). Once the delusional\nhypothesis is adopted as an explanation for or an endorsement of the\nunusual data, it is correct from a Bayesian point of view that it will\nnot be updated or revised due to a conflict with previous beliefs. New\nevidence would be necessary to prompt an update or a revision. That\nsaid, a critical evaluation of the maintenance of the delusional\nhypothesis can still be made because the delusional belief was formed\nas prepotent doxastic response to unusual data and thus it is likely\nto be compartmentalised. As Davies and Egan themselves acknowledge,\nthe application of idealised models of inference such as Bayesianism\nis somehow limited in the examination of actual belief systems. Even\nwhen no pathology is present, biases affecting the adoption and\nevaluation of hypotheses are going to be the (statistical) norm, which\nmakes it difficult to uniquely identify the problem with the adoption\nand the persistence of delusional beliefs.\n\nAlthough delusions can be irrational to a higher degree than normal\nbeliefs, as they may be less consistent with our other beliefs and\nbehavior and more resistant to counterevidence, they do not seem to be\nirrational in a qualitatively different way from nondelusional beliefs. This\nwould suggest that there are elements of continuity between delusions\nand irrational beliefs, although (as we shall see in the next section)\nthere exist sophisticated philosophical arguments challenging the\ncontinuity claim.\n4.2 Are delusions beliefs?\n\nAccording to the doxastic conception of delusions (dominant among\npsychologists and psychiatrists), delusions are belief states \u2013 it\nis an important diagnostic features of delusions that they can lead to\naction and that they can be reported with conviction, and thus that\nthey behave as typical beliefs. (See the entry on\n belief.)\n But there is an increasingly influential view in philosophy warning\nthat the doxastic characterization of delusions would lead to an\noversimplification of the phenomenon. Although some of the alternative\naccounts of delusions (e.g., experiential, phenomenological, and\nmetarepresentational) are critical towards standard doxastic\nconceptions, they do not necessarily deny that the phenomenon of\ndelusions involves the formation of beliefs. Rather, the central idea\nseems to be that, even if we report false or irrational beliefs when\nwe experience delusions, paying attention only to our first-order\ncognitive states and to the doxastic dimension of our mental life can\nlead to a partial and incorrect view of the phenomenon of delusions\n(see also Radden 2010).\n\nSome authors emphasize the experiential and\nphenomenological character of delusions over the doxastic one\n(e.g., Sass 1994; Gold and Hohwy 2000; Feyaerts et al. 2021), and\nothers conceive of delusions not as mere representations of our\nexperienced reality, but as attitudes towards representations (e.g.,\nCurrie 2000; Currie and Jureidini 2001; Stephens and Graham 2006).\nGallagher 2009 argues that an explanation of the delusion as a mere\ncognitive error would be inadequate, and introduces the terminology of\ndelusional realities, modes of experience which involve\nshifts in familiarity and sense of reality and encompass cognition,\nbodily changes, affect, social and environmental factors.\n\nMost of the authors who deny belief status to delusions have a\nnegative and a positive thesis. The positive thesis is an alternative\naccount of what delusions are. For instance, one might argue that\ndelusions are acts of imagination mistakenly taken by a person to have\nbelief status (Currie and Ravenscroft 2002) or empty speech acts with\nno intentional import (Berrios 1991). The negative thesis is an\naccount of why delusions are not beliefs. Beliefs have certain\ncharacteristics, that is, they are formed and revised on the basis of\nevidence, they are consistent with other beliefs, they are action\nguiding in the relevant circumstances. If delusions do not share these\ncharacteristics, then they are not beliefs.\n\nLet us list some of the arguments for the negative thesis:\n\nBeliefs are integrated with other beliefs. If delusions are not\nintegrated with our beliefs, then they are not\nbeliefs.\nBeliefs are responsive to evidence. If delusions are not\nresponsive to evidence, then they are not beliefs.\nBeliefs guide action. If delusions do not guide action, then they\nare not beliefs.\n\n\nThese arguments are central to the debate about the doxastic nature of\ndelusions (Bortolotti 2009). For instance, Currie and Jureidini 2001\n(p. 161) argue that delusions are more plausibly imaginings than\nbeliefs, because delusions \u2018fail, sometimes spectacularly, to be\nintegrated with what the subject really does believe\u2019, whereas\nthere is no requirement that imaginings are consistent with beliefs. Berrios 1991 argues that delusions cannot be beliefs for us,\nbecause we do not regard them as the most probable explanations for our unusual experience. Berrios reaches the\nextraordinary conclusions that delusions are not even intentional\nstates, but utterances without meaning, \u201cempty speech\nacts\u201d.\n\nAssessing arguments in (1) to (3) requires assessing empirical and\nconceptual claims. Let\u2019s consider (1), the \u2018bad\nintegration\u2019 objection to the belief status of delusions. In\norder to see whether the conclusion is convincing, an empirical claim\nabout delusions needs to be examined first: Do delusions really fail\nto integrate with our beliefs? Then, a conceptual claim needs\nassessing, the claim that not being integrated with our beliefs\nprevents delusions from being beliefs themselves. In many cases, the\nalleged \u2018fault\u2019 of delusions is exaggerated (e.g.,\ndelusions sometimes integrate well with our beliefs), but it would be plausible to claim that delusions exhibit that feature (bad integration)\nto a higher degree than nondelusional beliefs.\n\nThe most common versions of anti-doxastic arguments seem to rely on an\nidealization of belief states, and impose constraints on\ndelusions that not even typical beliefs would meet. The assumption\nseems to be that beliefs are essentially rational, and that delusions\nare not beliefs because they are not rational. But the abundant\npsychological evidence on familiar irrationality tells us that\nnondelusional beliefs are often irrational in exactly the same way as\ndelusions can be, although to a lesser degree. It is sufficient to\nthink about hypocrisy, about prejudiced and superstitious beliefs, and\nabout the many biases that affect belief updating in normal cognition\nto realize that the same kinds of irrationality that we find in\ndelusions are also common in many nondelusional beliefs (e.g., Nisbett\nand Ross 1980; more recently Bentall 2018). A general worry is that\nthe very notion of belief is not theoretically useful if the criteria\nfor what counts as a belief become too loose.\n\nIndependent of any given answer to the question whether delusions are\nbeliefs, two conceptions of delusions divide the philosophical scene.\nOne highlights the discontinuity between delusions and beliefs, and\nbetween neurotypical and neurodivergent cognition, with various\nconsequences for what counts as pathological, but also for the\navailability of therapeutic options, such as cognitive behavioral\ntherapy, for conditions characterised by delusions. The other view\ninsists that there is continuity between delusions and beliefs, and\nattempts to gather data both suggesting that people with delusions\nreason in much the same way as people without, and that delusion-like\nideas are widespread in the nonclinical population. Some studies have\ngathered a vast amount of empirical data about the temporal variations\nin delusions in context of psychopathologies, and the\npresence of delusion-like beliefs in the nonclinical population (e.g.,\nBentall 2003).\n4.3 Do delusions overlap with self-deception or beliefs in conspiracy theories?\n\nThere is no consensus on whether delusions overlap with instances of\nbelief that are frequent in the nonclinical population, such as self\ndeception or beliefs in conspiracy theories. Philosophers who ask\nsuch questions may be interested in supporting or challenging the\ncontinuity theory; mapping reasons why delusions should (or should\nnot) be regarded as pathological; or wanting to clarify the\ndistinctiveness of the phenomenon of clinical delusions.\n\nSelf deception has been traditionally characterized as driven by\nmotivational factors whereas delusions are now primarily accounted in\nneuropsychological terms. Although theories of delusion formation\ninvolve reference to perceptual and cognitive impairments, as we saw,\nmotivational factors play an important role in the explanation of some\ndelusions, e.g. by partially determining the specific content of the\nreported delusional state. Thus, one plausible view is that\nself-deception and delusion are distinct phenomena that may overlap in\nsome circumstances (for further analysis, see Bayne and\nFern\u00e0ndez 2008). There are three arguments for the view that\ndelusions and self-deception overlap.\n\nThe first view about the relationship between delusions and\nself-deception is that, when they overlap, they do so because they\nboth involve a motivationally biased treatment of evidence. If a\nmotivationally biased treatment of evidence is the key feature of\nself-deception (as for deflationists such as Mele 2001 and 2008), then\nwhen we have delusions we can be said to be self-deceived if we treat\nthe evidence at our disposal or search for evidence in a\nmotivationally biased way. This does not seem to be generally the case\nwith delusions, but can apply to some cases of delusions. Some\ndelusions of misidentification (at least according to\nneuropsychological accounts) do not seem to be akin to self-deception,\ngiven that there is no fundamental role for motivational biases in the\nexplanation of how we come to hold or retain the delusion. A different\nanalysis might be appropriate for delusions of jealousy or\npersecution.\n\nThe second view is that (some) delusions are extreme cases of\nself-deception and that they have a protective and adaptive function\n(see Hirstein 2005). An example is offered by Ramachandran, who\ndiscusses anosognosia, the denial of illness, and somatoparaphrenia,\nthe delusion that a part of one\u2019s body belongs to someone else.\nRamachandran 1996 reports the case of a woman (FD) who suffered from a\nright hemisphere stroke which left her with left hemiplegia. FD could\nnot move without a wheelchair and could not move her left arm. But\nwhen she was asked whether she could walk and she could engage in\nactivities which require both hands (such as clapping), she claimed\nthat she could. Ramachandran advances the hypothesis that behaviors\ngiving rise to confabulations and delusions are an exaggeration of\nnormal defense mechanisms that have an adaptive function, as they\nallow us to create a coherent system of beliefs and to behave in a\nstable manner. In the neurotypical case, the left hemisphere produces\nconfabulatory explanations aimed at preserving the status quo\n(\u2018I\u2019m not ill\u2019; \u2018My arm can move\u2019), but\nthe right hemisphere detects an anomaly between the hypotheses\ngenerated by the left hemisphere and reality. So, it forces a revision\nof the belief system. In patients such as FD, the discrepancy detector\nno longer works. It is very plausible that delusions in anosognosia\ninvolve motivational aspects. But whether these delusions are an\nexaggerated form of self-deception depends on the preferred\ntheoretical characterization of self-deception.\n\nThe third view about the potential overlap of delusions and\nself-deception is that the very existence of delusions (which shows\nthat doxastic conflict is possible) can help us vindicate the\ntraditional account of self-deception. According to this view, we have\ntwo contradictory beliefs, but we are aware of only one of them,\nbecause we are motivated to remain unaware of the other (McKay et\nal. 2005a, p. 314). This account derives from Donald\nDavidson\u2019s theory of self-deception (e.g. Davidson 1982 and\n1985b). When I deceive myself, I believe a true proposition but act in\nsuch a way as to causing myself to believe the negation of that\nproposition. Neil Levy argues that the conditions for self-deception\nset by the traditional approach are not necessary for self-deception,\nbut that the case of FD described by Ramachandran (1996) is living\nproof that a person can, at the same time, believe that her arm is\nparalyzed, and believe that she can move her arm. Moreover, it is the\nbelief that her arm is paralyzed that causes her to acquire the belief\nthat her arm is not. This is Levy\u2019s analysis of the typical\nperson with anosognosia Levy 2008 (p. 234):\n\nFD believes that her limb is healthy.\nNevertheless she also has the simultaneous belief (or strong\nsuspicion) that her limb is significantly impaired and she is\nprofoundly disturbed by this belief (suspicion).\nCondition (1) is satisfied because condition (2) is satisfied;\nthat is, FD is motivated to form the belief that her limb is healthy\nbecause she has the concurrent belief (suspicion) that it is\nsignificantly impaired and she is disturbed by this belief\n(suspicion).\n\n\nIf this analysis is correct, at least one case of delusion (e.g.,\nanosognosia) involves doxastic conflict. The most controversial aspect\nof this analysis concerns condition (2). Is the belief that her limb\nis impaired truly available to FD? One could argue that, given that FD\nprobably has a deficit in the discrepancy detector of the right\nhemisphere of the brain, she has no awareness of the impairment she\ndenies (see also Hirstein 2005). But Levy\u2019s reply is that\navailability comes in degrees. He suggests that, given that people\nwith paralysis and anosognosia often avoid tasks that would require\nmobility when costs for failure are high, and given that they can\nacknowledge some difficulties in movement (and say \u2018I have\narthritis\u2019 or \u2018My left arm has always been weaker\u2019),\nit is plausible that they have some awareness of their\nimpairment \u2013 although they may lack a fully formed and conscious\nbelief about it.\n\nThe debate about the differences between delusion and self-deception\nhas centred on whether delusions (just like ordinary instances of\nself-deception) are explicable from a folk-psychological point of view\n(Bortolotti and Mameli 2012; Murphy 2012, 2013). Murphy argues that\ndelusions are diagnosed when folk psychology runs out of resources for\nunderstanding what we seem to report as a genuine belief. By contrast,\nself-deception does not challenge our folk-psychological\ngeneralisations, because our beliefs are expected to be influenced by\nour desires at least on some occasions (e.g., when stakes are high).\nBortolotti and Mameli maintain that the gap between self-deception and\nmotivated delusions (such as anosognosia) is narrower than the gap\nbetween self-deception and apparently nonmotivated delusions, but\neven in the latter case folk psychology can account for the delusional\nbelief as an explanation (imperfect as it may be) of the delusional\nexperience.\n\nIn recent commentaries on the spread of conspiracy theories during a\ncrisis, comparisons between beliefs in conspiracy theories and\ndelusions have been ubiquitous (Bortolotti et al. 2021). For instance,\npeople have argued that what makes beliefs in flat Earth and climate\ndenial problematic is not their failing to represent reality\naccurately, but their rigidity and incorrigibility, which they see as\na typical feature of delusional beliefs. The comparison has been made\non the basis of three criteria: (a) how the beliefs manifest (e.g.,\nimplausibility and unshakeability); (b) how the beliefs are formed\n(e.g., faulty monitoring of ideas); and (c) how the beliefs affect\nwellbeing and good functioning.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the criteria in turn. With respect to surface\nfeatures, both clinical delusions and beliefs in conspiracy theories\nappear implausible to those who do not endorse them, and in some\ncircumstances quite unusual and bizarre as well. It is their alleged\nepistemic irrationality, though, that seems to play the central role\nin the comparison. It is commonly assumed that clinical delusions and\nbeliefs in conspiracy theories are neither well supported by evidence\nnor responsive to counterevidence. As we saw, there is a variation in\nthese features when they are applied to delusions, and similarly when\nthey are applied to beliefs in conspiracy theories. In the case of\ndelusions, the unusual experience we have may be considered prima\nfacie evidence for the delusional hypothesis; and in the case of\nconspiracy theories, if we belong to a group that has been\nmarginalised and excluded, then our previous experience with the\nauthorities may legitimise our mistrusting them as sources of\ninformation (Levy 2019).\n\nWith respect to how the beliefs are formed, there is no consensus.\nSome argue that the same models used to describe delusion formation\ncan be invoked in the description of how beliefs in conspiracy\ntheories emerge. For instance, for two-factor theorists, there is a\nfirst factor which is unusual experience in the case of delusion and\nepistemic mistrust in the case of beliefs in conspiracy theories.\nThen, there is a common second factor which comprises some reasoning\nbiases and motivational factors (e.g., Pierre 2020). The first factor\nwould explain the theme of the delusion or conspiracy. The second\nfactor would explain why the belief is endorsed and maintained despite\nits prima facie implausibility. For researchers working\nwithin a predictive coding account, paranoia predicts difficulty in\nupdating beliefs across the clinical-nonclinical divide, which\nsuggests that some of the same mechanisms may be responsible for how\npeople respond to uncertainties (Reed et al. 2020). Other researchers\nthough deny that there is overlap in etiology, and point to the fact\nthat no cognitive dysfunction needs to be postulated to explain the\nformation of beliefs in conspiracy theories (e.g., Oliver and Wood\n2014). \n\nFinally, with respect to the downstream effects of endorsing\ndelusional beliefs and beliefs in conspiracy theories, differences are marked. Whereas delusions are often\ncharacterised by disruption in psychological functioning and social\nwithdrawal and isolation, beliefs in conspiracy theories can be seen\nas cementing some relationships in well-defined social groups and as\nbeing protective against anxiety and stress. A closer examination may\nshed some doubt on the differences though. Some delusions can be\nadaptive in the short-term and some beliefs in conspiracy theories can\nbe harmful in the long term.\n\nIn sum, the views summarized here show that it can be very difficult\nto justify clear-cut distinctions between delusion and self-deception,\nand between delusions and beliefs in conspiracy theories. It is\ndiagnostically and scientifically useful to maintain a distinction\nbetween symptoms of clinical conditions and manifestations of everyday\nirrationality, but the elements of genuine overlap should also be\nacknowledged.",
