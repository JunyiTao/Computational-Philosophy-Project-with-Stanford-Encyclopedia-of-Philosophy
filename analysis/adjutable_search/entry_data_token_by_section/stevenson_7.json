Consequently, since the sentences of a language have\ndistinguishable kinds of dispositions, they have distinguishable kinds\nof meaning.\n\nThe emotive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the sign\nto a range of attitudes (1944, 59\u201360). From a hearer or reader\u2019s\npoint of view, feelings or attitudes are the responses, tokens of the\nsign are the stimuli; from a speaker or writer\u2019s point of view,\nattitudes are the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses. An\nattitude is itself a disposition whose stimuli and responses relate to\n\u201chindering or assisting\u201d the object of the attitude, that\nwhich one is for or against (1944, 60). As a disposition, the emotive\nmeaning of a sign remains relatively stable, though responses may vary\nacross contexts given different attendant, or contextual,\ncircumstances (1944, 60). Thus, a speaker\u2019s utterance of\n\u201cHooray!\u201d may be occasioned by excitement or, on rare\noccasion, even indifference; but the disposition of the sign to be\nused to express or to evoke these varying attitudes remains relatively\nstable, its stability a result of an \u201celaborate process of\nconditioning\u201d that gives rise to linguistic conventions (1944,\n60\u201362; for discussions of emotive meaning, more generally, and\nof Stevenson\u2019s account, in particular, see, e.g., Stroll 1954, Kerner\n1966, Urmson 1968, and Satris 1987).\n\nThe descriptive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the\nsign to a range of \u201ccognitive\u201d states, including belief,\nsupposition, presumption, etc. From a hearer or reader\u2019s point of\nview, cognitive states are the responses, tokens of the sign are the\nstimuli. From a speaker or writer\u2019s point of view, cognitive states\nare the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses. Cognitive\nstates, like attitudes, are complex dispositions. (1944,\n62\u201371)\n\nThe emotive and descriptive meanings of signs are related in a variety\nof ways. Signs may have both emotive and descriptive meaning, and\noften do. Perhaps a noncontroversial example is the sentence\n\u2018That was courageous\u2019, whose descriptive meaning relates\ntokens of the sentence to cognitive states that, in some way,\nrepresent the action referred to as one performed in spite of an\nactor\u2019s fear, and whose emotive meaning relates tokens of the sentence\nto favorable states, such as admiration towards the action or actor.\nAccording to Stevenson, almost all words in a natural language have\nboth emotive and descriptive meaning owing to their historical uses in\nemotional contexts (1944, 71). The interplay of emotive and\ndescriptive meaning is complex. For example, the word\n\u2018democracy\u2019 may have come to possess its laudatory emotive\nmeaning in certain contexts because the word refers, via its\ndescriptive meaning, to properties of government that are favored in\nthese contexts. Under suitable circumstances, the word might retain\nits descriptive meaning and acquire a less laudatory emotive meaning,\nor change its descriptive meaning due to its emotive meaning remaining\nconstant (1944, 72).\n",
