    "main_text": "Normative Power Theory || Contemporary Views\n1.3 Contemporary Views\n\nBy the twentieth century newer versions of normative power views began\nto appear. Unsurprisingly, these neo-normative power views were\ninitially most popular among theorists with a significant legal theory\nbent, e.g., H. L. A. Hart (1955) and Joseph Raz (1972, 1977, 1984,\n2012). But philosophers without any such link have also adopted them,\nsome examples being Gary Watson (2004)\u00a0and David Owens (2006,\n2008, 2012). \u00a0\n\nThe new normative power views generally ground the power the same way\nother elements of Hohfeldian (1919) systems (e.g., rights and\nprivileges) have been grounded, by appeal to our interests (see\nFeinberg 1970). Perhaps the paradigm of such a view is HLA\nHart\u2019s appeal in his seminal \u201cAre There Any Natural\nRights?\u201d (Hart 1955), where he makes promissory obligations out\nto rest on \u201cspecial rights\u201d generated by the parties, in\nthe interests of \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d:\n\n\nWhen rights arise out of special transactions between individuals or\nout of some special relationship in which they stand to each other,\nboth the persons who have the right and those who have the\ncorresponding obligation are limited to the parties to the special\ntransaction or relationship. [\u2026]\n\n(i) The most obvious cases of special rights are those that arise from\npromises. By promising to do or not to do something, we voluntarily\nincur obligations and create or confer rights on those to whom we\npromise; we alter the existing moral independence of the\nparties\u2019 freedom of choice in relation to some action and create\na new moral relationship between them, so that it becomes morally\nlegitimate for the person to whom the promise is given to determine\nhow the promisor shall act. That which corresponds very well to the\ndistinction between a right, which an individual has, and what it is\nright to do. The promisee has a temporary authority or sovereignty in\nrelation to some specific matter over the other\u2019s will which we\nexpress by saying that the promisor is under an obligation to the\npromisee to do what he has promised. To some philosophers the notion\nthat moral phenomena\u2014rights and duties or obligations\u2014can\nbe brought into existence by the voluntary action of individuals has\nappeared utterly mysterious; but this I think has been so because they\nhave not clearly seen how special the moral notions of a right and an\nobligation are, nor how peculiarly they are connected with the\ndistribution of freedom of choice [\u2026] (Hart 1955:\n183\u2013184)\n\n\nHart\u2019s proposal was the harbinger of a revival of these sorts of\ntheories, first among legal theorists and then to moral philosophers\nmore generally. One of the earliest and most influential authors to\ntake up Hart\u2019s idea is Joseph Raz. First appearing in his 1977\nessay \u201cPromises and Obligations\u201d (Raz 1977) and later in\nhis book The Morality of Freedom (1986) and elsewhere (see\nRaz 1982, 2014) Raz advances a normative power view that explicitly\ngrounds the promissory power in our interests in self-binding for\ncooperation and coordination:\n\n\nNormative powers are the abilities of people (or institutions) to\nchange normative situations or conditions (i.e., to impose or repeal\nduties, to confer or revoke rights, to change status etc.) by acts\nintended to achieve these changes, where the ability depends on\n(namely is based on, grounded on, justified by) the desirability (the\nvalue) of those people (or institutions) having them.\n\nIn the case of promises the value of the power is that it expands\npeople\u2019s ability to fashion their lives, or aspects of their\nlives, by their actions. Through their promises they commit themselves\nto others. Up to a point, promises are analogous to decisions that\nconstitute reasons for the deciders to perform the act they decided to\nperform. Both are ways of opening up options through closing other\noptions, normatively speaking. Decisions, as well as having goals,\nfacilitate undertaking complex activities (giving a ball, writing a\nsymphony, etc.) that require concerted actions. Promises, being\ncommitments to others, facilitate co-operation, the forging of\nrelations that presuppose dependence, trust and joint actions, and\nmore. For the sake of brevity I will refer to the value of having\nthese powers as the value of enhanced control (of one\u2019s life),\nthough a somewhat different explanation of their value is required\nwhen the powers are held by institutions. (Raz 2014: 61)\n\n\nDavid Owens (2006, 2008, 2011, 2012), in a recent and widely\ninfluential approach, proposes a power based in what he calls our\n\u201cauthority interest\u201d, or the interest we have in having a\ncertain practical authority over others, the authority that being the\nrecipient of a promise gives us. This power is one of a family of such\npowers, whose purpose is to serve our interest in being able to shape\nthe normative landscape by declaration, an interest that takes at\nleast two forms: the authority interest, which underwrites\npromissory obligation and the permissive interest that\nunderwrites the power of consent:\n\n\nI shall argue that promising exists because, at least when it comes to\neach other\u2019s actions, human beings often have what might be\ncalled an authority interest: I often want it to be the case that I,\nrather than you, have the authority to determine what you do. If you\npromise me a lift home, this promise gives me the right to require you\nto drive me home; in that sense, it puts me in authority over you. So\nmuch is obvious. What I claim is that human beings often want such\nauthority for its own sake (not just to facilitate prediction or\ncoordination). I often have an interest in having the right to\ndetermine whether you\u2019ll give me a lift, over and above any\ninterest I have in knowing what you (or we) will actually do. And I\nclaim that promising exists because it serves this authority interest.\n(Owens, 2006: 51)\n\n\nSeana Shiffrin (2008, 2012b) has also recently proposed a novel\nnormative power view, one that grounds the power in our interests in\nforming and maintaining relationships with others, rather than\nauthority or coordination. On Shiffrin\u2019s view promises are of a\npiece with other commitments that are integral to the structure of\nintimate relations between persons:\n\n\n[\u2026]The power to make binding promises, as well as to forge a\nvariety of other related forms of commitment, is an integral part of\nthe ability to engage in special relationships in a morally good way,\nunder conditions of equal respect. (Shiffrin 2008: 485)\n\n\nThese recent developments have spawned a burgeoning literature, with a\nfocus on the issue of normative powers themselves, e.g., Chang (2013,\n2020), Westlund (2013, 2018), Nieswandt (2017), as well as their\npropriety for explaining promissory obligation, e.g., E. Taylor\n(2013), Fruh (2014, 2019), Molina (2019), Melenovsky (2017) and\nothers.\n",
