The Range and Types of Special Obligations\n\nWhen and if we are able to defend the claim that we have fundamental\nagent-relative special obligations, we need to determine which special\nobligations we have. The political community, friendship, and\npromising/contracting have already been discussed as arenas in which\nspecial obligations may or may not arise. All of these areas of the\nmoral life have received extensive attention in the philosophical\nliterature. But there are two important contexts that have received\nless attention, but, for various reasons, are becoming more pressing\nfor moral agents in our society today. Hopefully, philosophers will\nbegin to pay these contexts the attention they urgently need.\n",
