    "main_text": "Determinism and Free Will\n3. Determinism and Free Will\n\nIt would appear that a religious person, especially one who belongs to\nthe Jewish faith, which stresses praxis, must affirm the position that\nhuman beings have free will; for if free will were denied, it would\nnecessarily follow that the commandments have no meaning. But how can\nthis religious affirmation co-exist with the fundamental religious\naffirmation of God\u2019s omniscience?\n\nAccording to the theory of radical determinism, any action we take\nonly appears to be the result of our choosing that particular action\nover others. In truth, however, our choice is the outcome of various\npredetermined factors that cause it to happen in a certain time and\nplace. Unlike radical determinists, the non-radical determinists, such\nas Polqar rejected the view according to which man\u2019s actions are\ndetermined and only appear to be the result of one\u2019s free\nchoice. The non-radical determinists admit that there is a connection\nbetween the upper-lunar world and the sublunary world, however this\nconnection is restricted merely to natural events; for example, an\noccurrence of an eclipse is determined and therefore can be known and\npredicted, unlike man\u2019s decision to act in a certain way. For\nAbner, determinism is entailed by God\u2019s omniscience, His\nabsolute knowledge of past, present, and future. Any affirmation of\none\u2019s liberty in making decisions and choosing specific actions\nis incompatible with this idea of God\u2019s perfect knowledge. In\nsum, for Abner, ascribing free will to human beings denies God\u2019s\nomniscience. In opposition to Abner, Polqar attempts to reconcile the\nidea of man\u2019s ability to choose with the concept of God\u2019s\nperfect knowledge. Polqar rejects Abner\u2019s view and contends that\nallowing man\u2019s free will alongside God\u2019s omniscience is\nthe only way to defend God\u2019s perfection.\n\nIn his Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Abner raises several arguments\nwhich support his radical determinism. One of these arguments is\ndirectly concerned with the question of man\u2019s free will. He\nwrites:\n\n\nThe third argument, particular to man, is from the aspect of the\nintellectual soul. He [Isaac] said that the intellectual soul is\nseparate and distinct from matter, and that the heavenly bodies,\ninsofar as they are material, lack the power to act upon it through\nanything. And because one could object that a separate power\ncan act upon the intellectual soul by compelling it to act or to\nreceive an action, and to will at times or not to will at times, he\nbolstered his utterances in this third argument by saying that if\nhuman accidents came about through necessitation and decree, then the\npropositions of our Holy Law would be destroyed; and all its\ncommandments and prohibitions would be in vain; and it would not be\nproper for the righteous man to receive reward for his good deeds, nor\nwould it be proper to punish the wicked, since all their actions would\nbe necessitated. Isaac took this support from the statements of Moses\nthe Egyptian and the other early theologians who spoke about this\nmatter. (Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter 2)\n\n\nMaterial objects cannot influence things that are separate from\nmatter. Since the intellectual soul is separate from matter, material\nobjects\u2014and here Abner is referring to the heavenly\nbodies\u2014cannot act upon it. However, Abner responds, while\nPolqar\u2019s argument explains why material bodies cannot act upon\nman\u2019s intellectual soul, it fails to explain why the separate\nintellects cannot act upon it. Abner stated that due to the weakness\nof his argument, Polqar needed to strengthen it from a theological\npoint of view; therefore, he supplemented his original argument with\nthe claim that the Mosaic commandments have no validity unless we\nassume that humans have free choice. Therefore, Abner concludes\nthat:\n\n\nIsaac not only wished to do away with astral decrees, but he also\nwished to do away with God\u2019s knowledge and His decrees\nconcerning all accidental and possible things. Because of this, he\nsaid in his book that we ought not to believe in any way that such\nthings can be known, or observed by any knower, before they exist.\nHence he implied that they cannot be known nor observed by God.\n(Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter 2)\n\n\nTo support his contrary conclusion, Abner quotes verses from the Old\nand New Testaments that in his view clearly show that God, with His\neternal knowledge, governs things in a particular manner. For example,\nJob 34:21\u201322 states: for His eyes are upon a man\u2019s\nways; He observes his every step. Neither darkness nor gloom offers a\nhiding-place for evildoers; and Psalms 33:13\u201315, The\nLord looks down from heaven; He sees all mankind. From His\ndwelling-pace He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth\u2014He\nwho fashions the hearts of the all, who discerns all their\ndoings. Presumably, since Polqar\u2019s last point here is in\nAbner\u2019s view purely theological, it is sufficient for Abner to\nrespond to it by citing biblical proof texts.\n\nPolqar\u2019s response to Abner leans first on Maimonides\u2019\nargument according to which God\u2019s knowledge and human knowledge\nhave nothing in common [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 136\u2013137;\nGuide of the Perplexed 3:20]. Therefore, we cannot even ask\nwhat God knows, or in what way He knows it. After establishing that\nthe knowledge of God is essentially different from that of humans,\nPolqar seems to contradict his own view that God\u2019s knowledge\ndoes not change. According to one passage, God\n\n\ndesires (\u1e25afe\u1e93) possibility as long as [the\npossible] exists, and then He produces things from this absolute\npotentiality and possibility when He so desires\n(ya\u1e25fo\u1e93). (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 137).\n\n\nHow can Polqar claim that God \u201cdesires\u201d something, when\ndesiring something implies an external need? Here it seems as if\nPolqar uses the word \u201cdesire\u201d to indicate the laws of\nnature: natural, accidental, and voluntary causes are within the\nnatural laws. Just as there are natural causes in the natural order,\nsimilarly, Polqar claims, the natural order contains possibility.\nThus, asking why possibility exists is similar to asking why a stone\nfalls down when we throw it: it falls because that is its nature.\n\nAfter establishing that God\u2019s knowledge is essentially different\nfrom human knowledge, Polqar turns to answer the following question:\nif God\u2019s knowledge is eternal, unchangeable, and complete, how\nis it possible to argue that men are free to choose their actions? In\none of his arguments, Polqar claims that men do have the liberty of\nchoosing, but that this ability is restricted to intellectuals. If a\nman does not actualize his intellect, he is no different from an\nanimal which acts on instinct alone:\n\n\nThe second argument is that it has been demonstrated that the\nexistence of something separate and distinct from matter is more\nexcellent and worthy than something material. Similarly, actions that\nare separate from matter are greater and more powerful than material\nactions. Also, the regression of the series of all agents terminates\nat a thing that is utterly separate from matter, so that we truly say\nthat [only] separate things are truly agents, and material things are\nacted upon. Now man\u2019s rational soul, from which desire and volition\nare produced, is separate from matter, and is analogous to the\nsupernal agents. Hence it is impossible for a material body to act\nupon it [man\u2019s rational soul]. This is what the rabbis meant\nwhen they said (Talmud Sab. 156a): \u201cIsrael is not subject to\nfate\u201d and \u201cThe gentiles are intimidated, but Israel is not\nintimidated\u201d, as I explained above [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat:\n124]. Hence those who maintain that the qualities of the soul proceed\nfrom, and are decreed by, the heavenly bodies simply err and are\nmistaken. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 139\u2013140)\n\n\n\u201cIsrael\u201d, Polqar\u2019s term for intellectuals, refers to\nthose people who use their intellectual faculty, the non-material part\nof their soul, in order to know God. According to Polqar, most human\nbeings are like animals, enslaved to their desires, and consequently\nlack freedom of choice; controlled by their desires, they differ from\nthe intellectuals, who live in accordance with the intellectual soul\nand who therefore are capable of choosing proper actions.\nParadoxically, however, if the intellectuals constantly follow their\nrational faculty, they, similar to the separate intellects, are\nprevented from choosing how to act because they are constantly\ndirected by the rational force. It would then follow that living\naccording to the intellect does not guarantee unconditional freedom,\nas intellectuals are still subject to reason. That said, it seems\nlikely that Polqar would agree that following the intellect\nnecessarily leads one to make rational decisions in one\u2019s life,\nwhich is the proper way to live.\n\nAbner alleged that Polqar\n\n\nnot only wished to do away with astral decrees, but also wished to do\naway with God\u2019s knowledge and His decrees concerning all\naccidental and possible things. (Min\u1e25at Qenaot, Chapter\n2)\n\n\nPolqar certainly did away with astral decrees, insofar as he\ndemonstrated that the heavenly bodies do not influence man\u2019s\nintellectual soul, because heavenly bodies are material bodies, and\nmaterial bodies cannot act upon man\u2019s non-material soul.\nAbner\u2019s additional argument, that the separate intellects can\nact upon one\u2019s soul even if we accept that the heavenly bodies\ndo not, is presented by Polqar himself as follows:\n\n\nThe activities of the rational soul are not generated from it by\nvirtue of its being rational. Therefore, I can reply to my critic that\na material agent may act upon it from the aspect of its not being\nrational, a fortiori that an immaterial agent may act upon\nit. Moreover, the human soul is not entirely separate from matter, but\nonly the acquired intellect, which is the agent intellect. Its\nactivity takes place only through the intermediary of the intellect\nthat is acted upon, which Aristotle considered to be subject to\ngeneration and destruction. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nInterestingly, the astrologer\u2019s objection, as presented by\nPolqar, includes activities (pe\u02bfulot ha-Nefesh) which\nclearly belong to the practical part of the soul in the intellectual\npart of the soul (ha-nefesh ha-hoga). In his view,\none\u2019s activities, since they do not derive from the intellectual\nsoul, are subject to being changed by a material agent, here the\nheavenly bodies. These activities are even more subject to an\nimmaterial agent: the separate intellect. The human soul, argues the\nastrologer, is not entirely separate from matter, and therefore the\nclaim that heavenly bodies can act upon it stands.\n\nPolqar, well aware of Abner\u2019s objection in Min\u1e25at\nQenaot, replies to the astrologer as follows:\n\n\nFrom what you have written in your astrology, the activity of wisdom\nin the human soul is decreed from the heavens. Now will you say of\nthis activity that it is not generated and originated in the\nsoul by virtue of the latter\u2019s being rational? As for your\nremark in your answer that \u201ca fortiori an immaterial\nagent can act upon it\u201d, you know well that our only disagreement\nconcerns the activity of the heavenly bodies, and not the activities\nof the separate entities. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nPolqar clearly considers Abner\u2019s objection to be valid, and\ntherefore he narrows his argument. Here he makes it clear that he\nrejects only the idea that the heavenly bodies, or any other\nmaterial body, act upon one\u2019s intellectual soul. In contrast,\nthe Active Intellect acts upon one\u2019s intellectual soul; indeed,\nseparate intellects are the only entities that can act upon\nman\u2019s intellectual soul. The Active Intellect acts upon\none\u2019s soul according to one\u2019s level of study of the\ntheoretical sciences: the more one occupies oneself with studying the\nsciences, the more the Active Intellect acts upon one\u2019s\nintellectual soul. Therefore, Polqar argues, his argument rejecting\nastrology is valid.\nMan\u2019s will vs. Natural will\n\nIn the last argument, the scholar clarifies to the astrologer the main\ndifferences between human will and the will of \u201cnatural\nthings\u201d:\n\n\nThe third argument: It is known that natural things behave in one\nmanner without the possibility of their being able to change their\nfunction and to act in a manner opposite to that to which they are\naccustomed. The soul\u2019s actions [mif\u02bfalei\nha-nafshyyim] are those that occasionally effect one thing and\noccasionally effect its opposite, according to their choice. If the\nacts of the soul were necessitated and compelled and decreed, then\nthey would be similar to natural acts, with absolutely no difference\nbetween them. If this were so, then how could the soul be considered\nto be the perfection of a natural body? For then the perfection of a\nbody would only be through its natural deeds, which would abolish the\nexistence of every soul. All these are sophistries, calumnies, and\nfollies. (\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 140)\n\n\nPolqar argues that depriving humans of free choice, as Abner suggests,\nwould entail that natural things and things endowed with souls would\noperate in a similar manner. This would mean that human actions would\nnot only be similar to natural actions, such as the occurrence of an\neclipse or the rising of the sun, but that human actions would also be\nessentially similar to the actions of the separate intellects. In\nother words, there would be no difference between the actions of\nperfect beings, such as the separate intellects, and the actions of\nimperfect beings, such as humans, who are comprised of material and\nnon-material parts. Moreover, if man\u2019s \u201cvoluntary\u201d\nactions were determined in the same way as the actions of natural\nthings, there would be no essential difference between man\u2019s\nperfect part, his soul, and his imperfect part, his body; for if all\nactions of man\u2019s soul, bodily and intellectual, happened\nnecessarily, such a distinction would no longer exist.\n\nIn sum, Polqar\u2019s discussion of God\u2019s foreknowledge and\nman\u2019s free will is a direct reply to the arguments raised by\nAbner in Min\u1e25at Qenaot. Polqar clearly modified his\narguments so as to make them more efficient against Abner\u2019s\nobjections. Polqar concludes the debate between the scholar,\npresumably presenting his own view, and the astrologer, presumably\nrepresenting Abner, as follows: firstly, possible and accidental\nthings are not predestined and cannot be known by any knower\n(including God) before they happen. Secondly, man\u2019s intellectual\nsoul is free from determinism. Finally, natural things are essentially\ndifferent from psychic things: the former act in a necessary way,\nwhile the latter act in a contingent manner.\n",
