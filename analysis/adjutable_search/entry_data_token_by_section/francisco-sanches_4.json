    "main_text": "Philosophical Works || Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known\n2.3 Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known\n\nSanches, the self-proclaimed follower of Carneades, begins\nQNS/TNK with the famous quote from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics: \u201c\u2018Mankind has an inborn desire to\nknow\u2019\u201d (TNK: 166, quoting Met. 1, 980a). As\nElaine Limbrick points out: \n\n\nThis quotation from the first line of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics ironically prefaces a treatise whose entire\npurpose is to destroy the Aristotelian system of knowledge by pointing\nout the inadequacies of the Aristotelian scientific methodology and\nthe failure of most ancient philosophers to formulate a theory of\nknowledge leading to absolute truth. (TNK: 166\u2013167, note 8) \n\n\nBut the irony doesn\u2019t stop there. Also ironic is the fact that\nThat Nothing is Known, marks a turning point in\nphilosophy\u2014as did Descartes\u2019 Meditations on First\nPhilosophy sixty years later\u2014from an emphasis in\nmetaphysics to one in epistemology; a philosophical turn often\nassociated with the birth of Western modern philosophy. To the person\nfamiliar with Descartes\u2019 Discourse on the Method (1637)\nthe opening paragraph of That Nothing is Known may appear\nsomewhat surprising, since the methodical doubt expressed in the first\nperson, conversational tone in the Discourse (Part II) seems\nalmost directly lifted from Sanches\u2019 QNS/TNK (more on\nSanches and Descartes in\n \u00a74).\n The French historian of philosophy, \u00c9tienne Gilson was among\nfirst to note the similarity of the language employed by both thinkers\nto give personal voice to their distinct notions of scepticism (Gilson\n1925: 267\u2013268). Sanches wrote:\n\n\nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into every-thing in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\nproffered to it; but a little later it was overtaken by indigestion,\nand began to spew it all forth again. Even at that period I was\nseeking to find some sustenance for my mind, such that my mind could\ngrasp it completely and also enjoy it without reservations; but no one\ncould appease my longing. I pored over the utterances of past\ngeneration of men, and picked the brains of my contemporaries. All of\nthem gave me the same answer, yet they brought me no satisfaction at\nall. Yes, I admit that some of them reflected a kind of shadow-image\nof the truth, but I found not one who gave an honest and full report\nof the judgments one ought to form concerning facts [res].\nSubsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to question everything,\nand to examine the facts themselves as though no one had ever said\nanything about them, which is the proper method of acquiring\nknowledge. I broke everything down into its ultimate first principles.\n(TNK: 167)\n\n\nFrom this point on, Sanches who begins by taking on Scholastic\nAristotelianism, states that his treatise will be written in simple,\nplain language. \u201cAccordingly you are not to look in me for an\nelegant, polished style\u201d (TNK: 171). He could write, if he\nwanted to, in such a style, he tells his reader, but he refuses to do\nso because \u201cTruth slips away while we substitute one word for\nanother and employ circumlocutions\u2014for this is verbal\ntrickery\u201d (TNK: 171). If that is what the reader wants then she\nshould turn to the elegant language of the rhetoricians like Cicero.\n\n\n\nAnd you should not ask me to quote many authorities, or to treat my\nauthorities with deference; deference is rather the mark of a servile,\nuntrained mind than of one that is truly investigating the Truth.\n(TNK: 171\u2013172) \n\n\nThe aim of such statements was clearly to criticize and to distinguish\nhimself from the Aristotelian emphasis on rhetoric as practiced by the\nScholastics. Rather than follow Aristotle, or any other authority, he\nwrote, \n\n\nI shall follow Nature alone. Authority bids us believe,\nwhereas Reason demonstrates; the former is more suited to\nfaith, the latter to the sciences. (TNK: 172) \n\n\nHere his notion of science is highly significant, because it is this\non which his scepticism rests. Science, as becomes clear by the end of\nThat Nothing is Known, has to do with rational demonstrations\nbased on facts or things (rerum) that come to us from the\nsenses (the eyes), albeit imperfectly. What Sanches seems to find most\ndifficult to \u201cswallow\u201d are metaphysical statements and\narguments that cannot be proven, except syllogistically by accepting\ntheir first principles on faith. Concepts that do not \u201cpossess\nan understanding of natural phenomena [\u201cres\nintelligas\u201d, QNS: 92]\u201d are \u201cinventions\u201d,\nsays Sanches; \u201cfor who could understand non-existent\nthings?\u201d (TNK: 168). The list of such abstract concepts include:\n\u201cDemocritus\u2019s Atom, Plato\u2019s Ideas,\nPythagoras\u2019s Numbers, and Aristotle\u2019s Universals, Active\nIntellect, and Intelligences\u201d (TNK: 168). He addresses himself,\nhe says, only to those who are \u201c\u2018not bound by an oath of\nfidelity to any master\u2019s words,\u2019\u201d but rather\n\u201cassess the facts for themselves, under the guidance of\nsense-perception and reason\u201d (TNK: 168). Having said this, he\nends the introduction to QNS/TNK, just as he did the Poem of\nthe Comet, with the sceptical \u201cQuid?\u201d or\nWhat?\n\n\u201cI do not know even this one thing, namely that I know\nnothing\u201d, is the opening sentence of the treatise (TNK: 172).\nSanches, next considers whether this is a paradoxical or contradictory\nprinciple of scepticism. For if you know how to establish\nthat you do not know anything, it follows that you already know\nsomething. Furthermore, he argues, if you \u201chave understood the\nambiguity of the inference, you have clearly perceived that nothing is\nknown\u201d (TNK: 173). And nothing is known, clearly because such\nambiguities only point to the fact that language does not give us\naccess to absolute knowledge. Dialectical, logical, and linguistic\nentanglements such as the one mentioned above only proves his point.\nThus in an allusion to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n(995a30), he asks his reader to help him \u201cuntie this knot\u201d\n(TNK: 173). This marks the beginning of his critique of Aristotelian\nnominalism.\n\nFor Sanches names are arbitrary, and therefore they can in no way\ndefine \u201cthe nature of things\u201d, or their essences. Now, if\nyou argue that you can use definitions to demonstrate the\nnature of a thing, \u201cthen show me one such\u201d, responds\nSanches. In a manner that recalls some twentieth century philosophers\nof language, Sanches questions whether words like Being, Substance,\nand Essence mean anything at all beyond the circularity of their\ndefinitions, and whether we even understand what we mean when we\nemploy them. For example, with respect to the notion of Being, he\nwrites: \n\n\nYou will say that you will not define this being, for it has no higher\ngenus to which it belongs. This I do not understand, nor do you. You\ndo not know what Being is; much less do I. (TNK: 175) \n\n\nTo muddy the waters even more, we often use different names to refer\nto the same thing (res), e.g., \u201cBeing, Substance, Body,\nLiving, Animal, Man, and finally Socrates\u201d to refer to humans.\nThis way a human being \u201cwho is something large, solid, and\nperceptible by the senses\u201d becomes an incomprehensible,\nconceptual abstraction.\n\nIn fact, not only do we not know anything through language, we do not\neven know what is \u201c\u2018knowledge\u2019\n[scientia]\u201d (TNK: 177). Statements such as\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cKnowledge is a mental disposition, acquired\nby demonstration\u201d only beg the question, what is \u201ca mental\ndisposition\u201d? And this, says Sanches, he does not know, so\nAristotle\u2019s definition of knowledge has failed to provide any\nkind of knowledge about what constitutes knowledge. \u201cYou are\nattempting to force me into a linear series of categorical\npropositions\u201d, writes Sanches as though he were playing some\nkind of language game with another philosopher (player); and\ncontinues, \u201cfrom these continually onwards, to Being\u2014and\nwhat that is, you do not know\u201d (TNK: 178). In this\nmanner all questions of knowledge are reduce to categorical\npropositions, and what are categorical propositions, if not \u201ca\nlong series of words\u201d (TNK: 178). Now, if such a term as a\n\u201cmental disposition\u201d is obscure, so is, to the same\ndegree, the definition of a \u201cdemonstration\u201d, says Sanches.\nFor a demonstration is defined as a \u201c\u2018syllogism\u2019\nthat gives birth to knowledge\u201d and so judges Sanches in his\nTribunal of Truth, \u201cYou have been guilty of a circular argument,\nand have deceived me just as you have deceived yourself\u201d (TNK:\n181). Not to mention, that there simply is \u201cno science\n[scientia] of syllogism\u201d. And there is no science, or\nknowledge that can be derived from the syllogism because all of\nAristotle, including the Metaphysics, is nothing but an\ninquiry about a name, as for \n\n\nexample whether substance can be predicated of a man\u2026And\ninasmuch as no one can know this for sure, there is no knowledge,\neither of things [\u201crerum\u201d, QNS: 101] or words\n[\u201cverborum\u201d, QNS: 101]. (TNK: 183)\n\n\nWe begin and end with particulars. In other words, with material\nobjects of perception: like this table before me, and not any\nsort of Platonic Form of table. \n\n\nIndividuals alone exist, and can be perceived; it is only of\nindividuals that knowledge can be possessed, and only from individuals\nthat it can be sought, \n\n\nargues Sanches. \n\n\nIf this is not so, show me where those \u2018universals\u2019 you\nspeak of occur in nature; you will admit that they occur in the\nparticulars themselves. (TNK: 213) \n\n\nSanches is clearly a nominalist. In fact, midway through\nQNS/TNK, he writes in capital letters: \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS\nPERFECT UNDERSTANDING OF A THING\u201d (TNK: 200). As Joseph Moreau\npoints out in \u201cDoute et Savoir chez Francisco Sanches\u201d\n(1960), this conception of knowledge or science as the \u201cabsolute\nand perfect\u201d understanding of a thing, is a left-over of ancient\nthought (1960: 37). But again, in any case, such \u201cperfect\nunderstanding\u201d only means apprehending all the qualities of a\nparticular object of perception. It does not mean apprehending the\nobject or the thing-in-itself, to put it in Kantian terms. Sanches\nwrites:\n\n\nThe sense perceives only the outward appearance of things, and does\nnot attain understanding (I am for the moment applying the word\n\u201csense\u201d to the eye). It is the mind that receives\nimages from the sense, and considers them. If the sense was deceived,\nso is the mind; but if not, what follows next? The mind regards only\nthe images of things, which the eye has taken in; it studies them from\nthis side and from that, and turns them about, putting the questions\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d and \u201cWhence comes its nature?\u201d\nand \u201cWhy\u201d\u2014and no more than this, for it too sees\nnothing that is certain. (TNK: 236)\n\n\nNot only does sensory perception fail to give us the answers to\nquestions of essences, natures, and origins (of noumena), it\nalso fails to give us certainty; for all we perceive are\n\u201caccidents\u2026the most commonplace of all existents\u201d\n(TNK: 237). We can only make inferences, says Sanches, from the\n\u201caccidents\u201d of \u201ccompound bodies\u201d. The\nimpediment to knowledge, he interestingly states, does not reside in\nthe object, but rather in the perceiving subject who cannot access\nthings themselves. \n\n\nExperience is in every instance deceitful and difficult. Even if it is\npossessed perfectly, it only reveals the external aspect of events; in\nno way does it reveal the natures of things. (TNK: 278) \n\n\nSanches continues:\n\n\nIn respect to the natures of things, it [judgment] reveals them only\nby speculation; and since it has not ascertained them by means of\nexperience, not only does it too fail to reach the thing itself, but\nsometimes it forms an opinion in exactly the wrong sense. (TNK:\n278)\n\n\nObviously if we do not have access to the things themselves, but only\nto the outward appearances of particulars, we cannot come to know\nthings by their causes either: \u201cWhence comes its nature?\u201d\nas he says. We are told, states Sanches, that knowledge means\nunderstanding something by its causes. But this cannot be the case and\nthe example he gives to illustrate his point, is that of the\nfather-son causal relation from Aristotle\u2019s Physics\n194b30: \u201cthe father is the cause of the child\u201d. But this,\nargues Sanches, does not lead to any kind of knowledge about the\nchild, \u201cfor what does my father contribute to an understanding\nof me?\u201d (TNK: 195). Nothing. The infinite regress\nrequired by the notion of causes applies no less to universals than it\ndoes to particulars. For even if one were to stop at God, as\n\u201cboth the first cause and the final end of all things\u201d\n(TNK: 196), and avoid the infinite, in \n\n\navoiding the infinite you fall into what is infinite and measureless,\nincomprehensible, ineffable and beyond the reach of the understanding.\n(TNK: 196) \n\n\nAnd yet, according to you, says Sanches to his reader, this Being that\nis admittedly beyond your understanding \u201cis the cause of\neverything; and therefore, according to your definition, understanding\nof Him is necessary for the understanding of His works\u201d, which\nonly proves that \u201cyou know nothing\u201d (TNK: 196). It was\nthis, Sanches\u2019 fideism that probably saved him from a fate\nsimilar to that of Giordano Bruno\u2019s. Sanches\u2019 target was\nAristotelian epistemology, never faith. He denied not only knowledge\nof efficient and first causes, but also of material and formal causes.\nAristotle\u2019s answers to sundry philosophical matters failed to\nconvince him. When Aristotle wrote in the Posterior Analytics\nthat \u201c[s]ome hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the\nprimary premises, there is no scientific knowledge\u201d (1.3\n72b5\u20136), he was addressing the very sceptical notion of\nknowledge held by someone like Sanches. \u201cOur own\ndoctrine\u201d, wrote Aristotle, \u201cis that not all knowledge is\ndemonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate\npremises is independent of demonstration\u201d (1.3\n72b18\u201320, my emphasis). But this is exactly the problem for\nSanches; for if primary and immediate premises do not require\ndemonstration, that means one has perfect knowledge of them, as one\nwould of first causes (like God), but that is not true. And if one\ndoes not have perfect knowledge of primary and immediate premises,\nthen where do they come from? What makes an indemonstrable primary\npremise the guarantor of knowledge? Nothing, answers Sanches. Primary\npremises are inventions that we need to take on faith in order to\nelude an infinite regress, and end up in the kind of scepticism that\nAristotle wanted to avoid. However, if, as Aristotle proposed,\n\u201cdemonstration must be based on premises prior to and better\nknown than the conclusion\u201d (1.3 72b25\u201326), and\ndemonstrations were based on premises that were themselves arbitrary\ninventions, then demonstrations were not to be taken as reflecting\nperfect knowledge, or as Sanches would have it, any knowledge at all.\nSanches writes:\n\n\n\u201cKnowledge is acquired by demonstration\u201d: this in turn\nassumes a definition. Now, definitions cannot be proved, but\nhave to be believed; therefore demonstration based on\nassumptions (ex suppositis) will produce knowledge of a\nsuppositious kind, not sound exact knowledge\u2026So the conclusions\nto be drawn from these first principles will be things assumed, not\nthings known. (TNK: 201)\n\n\nTherefore Aristotle\u2019s statement in the Posterior\nAnalytics that \u201csince the object of pure scientific\nknowledge cannot be other than it is, the truth obtained by\ndemonstrative knowledge will be necessary\u201d (1.3 73a2\u201323),\nwas epistemologically insufficient for Sanches. Such necessity would\nmerely be the syllogistic necessity of a conclusion following from\narbitrary premises. But beyond the logical, there was also a\npsychological dimension to Sanches\u2019 scepticism, which is\nimplicit in the rhetorical tone of QNS/TNK, and the ever\npresent other, to whom the treatise is directed. The tone vacillates\nfrom exasperation to despair at not being able to know more than what\nis derived from the language and the senses. Sanches dramatically\nstates:\n\n\nHow unhappy our situation is! We are blind in the midst of light. I\nhave often reflected about light, but always given up without thinking\nit through or understanding or comprehending it. It is the same if you\nreflect on the will and the intellect and other objects that are not\nperceived by means of the senses. (TNK: 243)\n\n\nAnd in words that anticipate Descartes\u2019 certainty regarding the\nexistence of the cogito (cf. Cottingham 1998: 9), he\ndeclares: \n\n\nOf this I am sure, that I am at this moment thinking of the words that\nI am writing, and that I wish to write them, and long for them both to\nbe true and win your approval; (TNK: 243) \n\n\nbut \n\n\nwhen I try to reflect on what this thinking is, and this wishing, and\nthis longing\u2026then my thinking quite fails me, my wishing is\nfrustrated, and my yearning grows ever greater while my concern also\nincreases. (TNK: 243) \n\n\nAll this initially reminds us of Descartes; but later in a pessimistic\ntone, he goes on to say that it is this epistemological uncertainty,\nthis wish to understand (cognitio) \u201cinward ideas\u201d\nand the impossibility of attaining such knowledge and understanding\nbeyond the senses that drives him to despair. \u201cI see nothing\nthat I could seek to lay hold on, or might possibly grasp\u201d (TNK:\n243), he writes in frustration. Then in a moment that recalls\nVives\u2019 scepticism (cf. Casini 2009), he ponders: if I am\n\u201cincapable of comprehending [even] the self\u201d perfectly,\nhow am I \u201cto comprehend the most abstruse secrets of Nature,\namong which are included spiritual things\u2026?\u201d (TNK: 239).\nClearly, argues Sanches, no one doubts that scientific knowledge\n(scientia) ought to be perfect, but there is nothing, not\neven in Nature, that is perfect (TNK: 289). And yet this does not lead\nSanches to the equanimity or ataraxia\n(\u1f00\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1) of the Stoics.\nInstead his impassioned scepticism encourages the active search for\nknowledge. To that end, he ends his treatise with the exhortation:\n\u201cTo work\u201d (TNK: 290) and asks his imaginary interlocutor\nto teach him what he knows, while he sets to do the double work of\nexamining \u201cThings\u201d while questioning everything\nthat ought to be questioned. Like the Poem of the Comet the\ntreatise\u2019s final word is the interrogative: Quid?/What?\n",
