    "main_text": "The History of the Historical Challenge || Duhem on Continuity\n1.2 Duhem on Continuity\n\nThis kind of attitude was captured by Pierre Duhem\u2019s (1906)\ndistinction between two parts of a scientific theory: the\nrepresentative part, which classifies a set of experimental laws; and\nthe explanatory part, which \u201ctakes hold of the reality\nunderlying the phenomena\u201d (1906 [1954: 32]). Duhem understood\nthe representative part of a theory as comprising the empirical laws\nand the mathematical formalism, which is used to represent,\nsystematize and correlate these laws, while he thought that the\nexplanatory part relates to the construction of physical (and in\nparticular, mechanical) models and explanatory hypotheses about the\nnature of physical processes which purport to reveal underlying\nunobservable causes of the phenomena. For him, the explanatory part is\nparasitic on the representative. To support this view, he turned to\nthe history of science, especially the history of optical theories and\nof mechanics. He argued that when a theory is abandoned because it\nfails to cover new experimental facts and laws, its representative\npart is retained, partially or fully, in its successor theory, while\nthe attempted explanations offered by the theory get abandoned. He\nspoke of the \u201cconstant breaking-out of explanations which arise\nto be quelled\u201d (1906 [1954: 33]).\n\nThough Duhem embedded this claim for continuity in theory-change in an\ninstrumentalist account of scientific theories, he also took it that\nscience aims at a natural classification of the phenomena, where a\nclassification (that is the representation of the phenomena within a\nmathematical system) is natural if the relations it\nestablishes among the phenomena gathered by experiments\n\u201ccorrespond to real relations among things\u201d (1906 [1954:\n26\u201327]). Hence, scientific knowledge does go beyond the\nphenomena but in doing so, that is, in tending to be a natural\nclassification, it can extend only up to relations among \u201chidden\nrealities whose essence cannot be grasped\u201d (1906 [1954: 297]). A\nclear mark of the naturalness of a classification is when it issues in\nnovel predictions (1906 [1954: 28]). Hence, successful novel\npredictions issued by a theory are a mark for the theory getting some\naspects of reality right, viz. real relations among unobservable\n entities.[2]\n",
