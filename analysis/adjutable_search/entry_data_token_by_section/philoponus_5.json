    "main_text": "Extant Philosophical Commentaries || Theory of Matter\n2.4 Theory of Matter\n\n\nLike place, space as a whole is the indeterminate three-dimensional extension everywhere devoid\nof body, though it is not actually infinite \u2013 so much Philoponus\nconcedes to Aristotle. Philoponus\u2019 discussion of matter builds\nupon this conception of space. In the Physics commentary\n(687f.) he argues in a similar vein to Aristotle in\nMetaphysics VII 3: In abstracting all qualities and other\ndeterminations from body Aristotle arrived at a conception of\ncharacterless, undetermined matter, an idea of matter like the \u201cprime matter\u201d that\nthe Neoplatonists later defined as formless and incorporeal (because\nit was no actual body, but only the necessary underlying condition\nfor bodies).  Philoponus, in contrast, arrives at something\nhe calls corporeal extension (s\u00f4matik\u00f3n\ndi\u00e1st\u00eama), which is a composite of Stoic-Neoplatonic prime\nmatter and indeterminate quantity and must not be confused with\nPhiloponian space. His argument here may still be regarded as an\nelaboration on or correction of Aristotle. However, in Book XI of the\npolemical treatise against Proclus (see below, 3.1) he jettisons the\nNeoplatonic conception of prime matter and posits as the\nmost fundamental level of his ontology \u2018the\nthree-dimensional\u2019, as he calls it, i.e. indeterminately extended\nmass. In this he claims to be following the Stoics (Aet.\n414), and it has been pointed out that this ontological level is\nreminiscent to us of the Cartesian res extensa, although\nDescartes would not allow Philoponus\u2019 distinction between space\nand corporeal extension.  In order to rebuff the likely objection that\n\u2019the three-dimensional\u2019 cannot be the most fundamental level of being\nbecause extension, belonging to the Aristotelian category of quantity,\nis an accident and requires the assumption of a distinct underlying\nsubject, Philoponus argues that extension is in fact not an accident,\nbut an essential and inseparable differentia of \u2018the\nthree-dimensional\u2019, just like heat in fire or whiteness in\nsnow. Thus quantity (corporeal extension) is constitutive of body as\nsuch. This amounts to a promotion of one sort of quantity to the\ncategory of substance.  There are indications that Philoponus would\naccordingly have modified Aristotle\u2019s scheme of the\nCategories if he had revised his early commentary on that\ntreatise.\n\n The incomplete commentary on the Meteorology may well be the\nlast commentary Philoponus wrote on Aristotle. It is instructive to\nnotice how the lectures are presented here with an air of aloofness and, at\ntimes, deliberate vagueness.  In several places, especially when he\nhas to comment on the nature and movement of the heavens, Philoponus\nbreaks off and refers the student to previously published work: what\nPhiloponus really has to say about the text seems no longer\nappropriate for the traditionally conceived class-room. He has shaken\noff the weight of Aristotle\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s authority,\nand far from attempting to demonstrate the harmony among philosophers\nhe puts himself forward as a philosopher who dissents from the\nrecognized philosophical authority. The commentator has turned into a\ncritic with independent philosophical ideas of his own.\n",
