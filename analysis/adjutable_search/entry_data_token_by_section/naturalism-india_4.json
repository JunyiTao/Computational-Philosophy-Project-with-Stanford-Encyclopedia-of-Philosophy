    "main_text": "Indian Concepts of Nature || An Extreme Naturalism (Svabh\u0101vav\u0101da)\n2.3 An Extreme Naturalism (Svabh\u0101vav\u0101da)\n\nSvabh\u0101vav\u0101da, which is the strongest form of ontological\nnaturalism in Indian scenario, literally means \u2018the view of\nindividual nature/essences\u2019 (Bhattacharya, R. 2002). The\nhard-core naturalists, C\u0101rv\u0101kas, admit four types of basic\nmaterial elements\u2014earth, water, fire and air. They reject\natomism, however, since they refuse to admit any imperceptible thing\nin their ontology, including God, Soul, \u0101k\u0101\u015ba and all\nkinds of non-natural forces. The material elements are said to possess\nsome qualities naturally. Multifarious objects of this world including\nliving and conscious beings are produced out of the combination of\nmaterial elements. It is generally held that the nature of any effect\nis determined by the nature of its cause.The reductionist\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas and the nihilist \u0100j\u012bvika-s, however, deny\nany causal connection between the material elements and the compounds\narising out of them. The C\u0101rv\u0101kas, however, deny any causal\nconnection between the material elements and the compounds arising out\nof them. Just as fire is naturally hot and water is naturally cold,\nsimilarly, they hold, sugarcane is naturally sweet, margosa leaves are\nnaturally bitter and thorns are naturally sharp. They think that\nfurther componential or causal analysis is completely redundant. The\ndistinguishing feature of this kind of extreme naturalism is a belief\nin a fortuitous generation of events (\u0101kasmikat\u0101v\u0101da).\nCausal relations are supposed to involve necessity, but necessity is\nnot perceptible and whatever is not perceptible cannot be inferred or\nestablished by any other means. Udayana argues, in an elaborate\ncritique of this view (Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali I,\n4\u20135), that every event must have a cause because every event\nwithout exception has \u2018conditional\u2019 (s\u0101pek\u1e63a)\nexistence, because it has \u2018occasional\u2019\n(k\u0101d\u0101citka) existence, i.e., it occurs at a certain time. An\neternal entity is always existent and a fictitious entity does not\nexist at any time: as these are not characterized by occasional\nexistence, these are not caused. The only counter-instance to this\nrule is prior absence, which has occasional existence but being\nbeginningless has no cause. C\u0101rv\u0101kas affirm, however, that\nan event need not originate from a cause; it may come into being\nfortuitously. Even the occasional origination of an event is due to\nthe nature of the event and has got nothing to do with its cause.\n\nThe thesis of fortuitous generation may be given five alternative\nformulations on the basis of the etymological analysis of the word\n\u2018akasm\u0101t\u2019 (without cause):\n\nAn effect does not originate from a cause.\nAn effect does not arise at all.\nAn effect is self-caused; it is not determined by any external\ncondition.\nAn effect is generated by an unreal cause.\nThe occurrence of an effect is not determined by its cause but by\nits own nature (svabh\u0101va).\n\n\nUdayana objects to all these formulations. If an effect were not\ndependent on its cause for its existence, then it could have occurred\nat any time, in fact at all times, and thus would lose its occasional\nnature. In fact, every effect has a temporal limit fixed by its cause,\nprior to which it cannot exist. The second formulation runs contrary\nto our perception of the occurrence of an event at a particular\nspatio-temporal location. The third formulation is unacceptable\nbecause the same thing cannot be both a cause and an effect at the\nsame time in respect of the same set of conditions, and because it is\nnot possible for anything to exist before its origination. The fourth\nformulation is rejected outright for no unreal thing can ever enter\ninto a causal process. The fifth formulation leaves us totally\nmystified because the proponents of the fortuitous generation thesis\nhave nowhere specified what this nature is by virtue of which an\neffect can occur without its cause. So we wonder, is this nature\ndifferent from or the same as the effect? On the first alternative the\nprinciple of causality is re-established while the second alternative\nis unintelligible. If the nature of an effect is the same as the\neffect and a thing can never be separated from its nature, then it\nwould follow that an existent entity would go on causing its own\nexistence over and over again. This is surely absurd. Philosophically\nthese arguments appear to be pretty convincing, but C\u0101rv\u0101ka\nnaturalists may find an ally in quantum physical talk about\nspontaneous decay of a radioactive element, quantum jumps, and so\nforth.\n",
