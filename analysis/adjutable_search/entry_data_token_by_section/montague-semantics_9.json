    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects || Pragmatics\n3.4 Pragmatics\n\nThe truth conditions of sentences sometimes vary with the context of\nuse. Thus, whether I am happy is true, depends on who the\nspeaker is; other examples include the referents of here and\nthis. Montague (1968; 1970b) addressed these factors,\nindicating that they could be treated by introducing additional\nparameters besides the time and the possible world. Despite occasional\ncritcism (Cresswell 1973, 111; Lewis 1980, 86f.), the treatment of\ncontextual dependence by way of a fixed finite list of parameters has\nbecome quite standard in formal semantics.\n\nMontague initially treated contextual parameters on a par with times\nand worlds, but in \u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 (Montague 1970c) he\nindicated that a distinction should be made between those that\ndetermine the content (which, following Frege 1892, is what is denoted\nin indirect contexts) from those that constitute it:\n\nThus meanings are functions of two arguments\u2013 a possible world\nand a context of use. The second argument is introduced in order to\npermit a treatment [\u2026] of such indexical locutions as\ndemonstratives, first- and second-person singular pronouns, and free\nvariables (which are treated [\u2026] as a kind of demonstrative).\nSenses on the other hand [\u2026] are functions of only one\nargument, regarded as a possible world. The intuitive distinction is\nthis: meanings are those entities that serve as interpretations of\nexpressions (and hence, if the interpretation of a compound is always\nto be a function of the interpretations of its components, cannot be\nidentified with functions of possible worlds alone), while senses are\nthose intensional entities that are sometimes denoted by expressions.\n(Montague 1970c, 379)\n\n\nWhile these remarks are still a far cry from double-indexing\napproaches to context dependence (Kamp 1971), they do exhibit the\nbasic idea underlying the shiftability criterion for distinguishing\ncontext and index (Lewis 1980). In particular, Montague\u2019s\nmeanings share a core feature with Kaplan\u2019s (1989) characters:\nboth map paramteterized contexts to propositions, understood as\n(characteristic functions of) sets of possible worlds.\n\nMontague (1970c, 68) followed Bar-Hillel 1954 in treating context\ndependence as part of pragmatics. It was only after his death, that\nhis framework was connected to other aspects of pragmatics. In\nparticular, in early work on Montague grammar, various proposals were\nmade to give compositional characterizations of presuppositions and\n(conventional) implicatures (Peters 1979; Karttunen and Peters 1979),\nbut later treatments were not always completely compositional, taking\nseveral contextual factors into account (Beaver 1997). In a similar\nvein, early work in the tradition was rather optimistic about directly\napplying Montague semantics to non-declarative uses of (declarative)\nsentences (Cresswell 1973), but later accounts had to invoke a lot\nmore than linguistic meaning, including models of interlocutors\u2019\nperspectives (Gunlogson 2003).\n",
