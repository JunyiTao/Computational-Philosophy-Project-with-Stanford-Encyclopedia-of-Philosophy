    "main_text": "Causality in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee || Two Different Concepts of the Modalities\n7.4 The Cum-Possibility of Occasionalism and Secondary Causality\n\nIn the Second Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\npresents two different \u201capproaches\u201d (singl.\nmaslak) in order to counter Avicenna\u2019s position that\nthe necessary connection between existing causes and effects renders\nsome miracles in the Qur\u2019an impossible. In the First Approach\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee denies the existence of \u201cnatures\u201d\n(tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019) and of causal connections and\nmaintains that God creates every event immediately. This is the part\nof the 17th discussion where he presents occasionalism as a viable\nexplanation of what we have usually come to refer as efficient\ncausality. God\u2019s eternal and unchanging knowledge already\ncontains all events that will happen in creation. By creating\ncombustion every time fire touches cotton, God follows a certain\ncustom (\u2018\u00e2da). In real terms, however, combustion\noccurs only concomitantly when fire touches cotton and is not\nconnected to this event. In the First Approach of the Second Position\nin the 17th discussion (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a,\n169.14\u2013171.11) and in some of his later works\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1962), he maintains that causal processes may\nsimply be the result of God\u2019s habit and that He creates what we\nconsider a cause and its effect individually and immediately. When God\nwishes to perform a miracle and confirm the mission of one of His\nprophets, he suspends His habit and omits to create the effect He\nusually does according to His habit.\n\nThe Second Approach (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 171.12\u2013174.8)\npresents a very different explanation of prophetical miracles. Marmura\n(1981) called it \u201cal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s second causal\ntheory.\u201d Here al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee accepts the existence of\n\u201cnatures\u201d (tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019) and of\nunchanging connections between causes and their effects. In the second\ncausal theory al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee merely points out that despite\nhuman efforts in the natural sciences, we are far away from knowing\nall causes and explaining all processes in nature. It may well be the\ncase that those miracles that the fal\u00e2sifa deny have\nimmanent natural causes that are unknown to us. When Moses, for\ninstance, threw his stick to the ground and it changed into a serpent\n(Qur\u2019an, 7.107, 20.69, 26.32) the material of the wooden stick\nmay have undergone a rapid transformation and become a living animal.\nWe know that wood disintegrates with time and becomes earth that\nfertilizes and feeds plants. These plants are, in turn, the fodder of\nherbivores, which are consumed by carnivores like snakes. The\nfal\u00e2sifa cannot exclude that some unknown cause acts as\na catalyst and may rapidly expedite the usually slow process where the\nmatter of a wooden stick is transformed into a snake. These and other\nexplanations given in the Second Approach are only examples of how the\nprophetical miracles may be the result of natural causes that are not\nfully understood by humans.\n\nMarmura (1965, 183; 1981, 97) rejected the suggestion that\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee might have held occasionalism and secondary\ncausality as two cum-possible cosmological explanations. Marmura\nconceded that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee makes use of causalist language\n\u201csometimes in the way it is used in ordinary Arabic, sometimes\nin a more specifically Avicennian / Aristotelian way\u201d and that\nthis usage of language is innovative for the Ash\u2019arite school\ndiscourse (1995, 89). Yet in all major points of Muslim theology\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee held positions that follow closely the ones\ndeveloped by earlier Ash\u2019arite scholars, namely the possibility\nof miracles, the creation of humans acts, and God\u2019s freedom\nduring the creation of the universe (1995, 91, 93\u201397,\n99\u2013100). In Marmura\u2019s view, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee never\ndeviated from occasionalism, while he sometimes expressed his opinions\nin ambiguous language that mocked philosophical parlance, probably in\norder to lure followers of fals\u00e2fa into the\nAsh\u2019arite occasionalist camp.\n\nThat al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee considered occasionalism and secondary\ncausality as cum-possible explanations of God\u2019s creative\nactivity is stated, however, in a passage in the 20th discussion of\nthe Incoherence on the subject of corporeal resurrection in\nthe afterlife. The fal\u00e2sifa argue that corporeal\nresurrection is impossible because it requires the transformation of\nsubstances like iron into a garment, which is impossible. In his\nresponse, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee refers to the Second Approach of the\nSecond Position in the 17th discussion where, he says, he had already\ndiscussed this problem. He argues that the unusually rapid recycling\nof the matter that makes up the piece of iron into a piece of garment\nis not impossible. \u201cBut this is not the point at issue\nhere,\u201d al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says. The real question is whether\nsuch a transformation \u201coccurs purely through [divine] power\nwithout an intermediary, or through one of the causes.\u201d He\ncontinues:\n\nBoth these two views are possible for us (kil\u00e2hum\u00e2\nmumkin\u00e2n \u2018indan\u00e2) (\u2026) [In the 17th\ndiscussion we stated] that the connection of connected things in\nexistence is not by way of necessity but through habitual events,\nwhich can be disrupted. Thus, these events come about through the\npower of God without the existence of their causes. The second [view]\nis that we say: This is due to causes, but it is not a condition that\nthe cause [here] would be one that is well-known\n(ma\u2019h\u00fbd). Rather, in the treasury of things that\nare enacted by [God\u2019s] power there are wondrous and strange\nthings that one hasn\u2019t come across. These are denied by someone\nwho thinks that only those things exists that he experiences similar\nto people who deny magic, sorcery, the talismanic arts, [prophetic]\nmiracles, and the wondrous deeds [done by saints].\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 222.)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee maintained this undecided position throughout\nhis lifetime. Given the fact that neither observation nor any other\nmeans of knowing (including revelation) gives a decisive proof for the\nexistence or non-existence of a connection between a cause and its\neffect, we must suspend our judgment on this matter. God may create\nthrough the mediation of causes that He employs, or directly without\nsuch mediation. This undecided position is unfortunately nowhere\nclearly explained. It can be gathered from isolated statements like\nthe one above and the fact that after the Incoherence\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wrote books where he maintained a distinctly\noccasionalist cosmology (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1962) and others like\nthe 35th book of his Revival or the Niche of Lights,\nwhere he uses language that is explicitly causalist. In none of these\nbooks, however, he commits himself to the position that the cause is\nconnected to its effect. God may create the two independently from one\nanother or He may create them through the mediation of secondary\ncauses. In his very last work, completed only days before his death,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee discusses whether God creates \u201cthrough\nthe mediation\u201d (bi-w\u00e2sita) of his creations or\nnot, and maintains that the matter cannot be settled decisively\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1985, 68\u201369).\n\nIn all this al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee accepted the unchanging character\nof this creation. Once God chose to create this world among\nalternatives, He also chose not to change the rules that govern it.\nWhile it is conceivable and therefore possible that God would break\nhis habit or intervene in the assigned function of the secondary\ncauses, He informs us in His revelation that He will not do so. In the\n31st book of his Revival, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that\nGod creates all things one after the other in an orderly manner. After\nmaking clear that this order represents God\u2019s habit\n(sunna), he quotes the Qur\u2019an (33:62 and 48:23):\n\u201cYou will not find any change in God\u2019s habit.\u201d\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 11:2084\u201385.) This verse\nis quoted several times in the Revival; in one passage\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adds that we should not think God will ever\nchange His habit (ibid, 4:12). Prophetical miracles are merely\nextraordinary occurrences that take place within the system of the\nstrictly habitual operation of God\u2019s actions or within the\n\u201cnatural laws\u201d that govern the secondary causes. Miracles\nare programmed into God\u2019s plan for His creation, so to speak,\nfrom the very beginning and do not represent a direct intervention or\na suspension of God\u2019s lawful actions (Frank 1992, 59; idem,\n1994, 20). Given that there will never be a break in God\u2019s\nhabit, an occasionalist universe will always remain indistinguishable\nfrom one governed by secondary causality.\n",
