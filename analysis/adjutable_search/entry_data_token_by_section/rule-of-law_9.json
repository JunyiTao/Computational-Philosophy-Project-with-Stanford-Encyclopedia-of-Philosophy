    "main_text": "Rule of Law and Rule by Law\n4. Rule of Law and Rule by Law\n\nSome theorists draw a distinction between the Rule of Law and what\nthey call rule by law (see e.g., Tamanaha 2004: 3). They\ncelebrate the one and disparage the other. The Rule of Law is supposed\nto lift law above politics. The idea is that the law should stand\nabove every powerful person and agency in the land. Rule by law, in\ncontrast, connotes the instrumental use of law as a tool of political\npower. It means that the state uses law to control its citizens but\ntries never to allow law to be used to control the state. Rule by law\nis associated with the debasement of legality by authoritarian\nregimes, in modern China for example.\n\nThomas Hobbes may be seen as a theorist of rule by law. In a society\nwhose members disagree about property, he thought it conducive to\npeace for the sovereign of a society \u201cto make some common Rules\nfor all men, and to declare them publiquely, by which every man may\nknow what may be called his, what anothers\u201d (Hobbes 1647: Bk.\nII, ch. 6, sect. ix).\nBut Hobbes also thought that it would undermine peace\u2014indeed it\nwould undermine the very logic of sovereignty\u2014for the ultimate\nlaw-maker to be bound by the laws he applied to his subjects (Hobbes\n1991 [1651]: 184).\n\nHowever, the distinction may not be so clear-cut. Even rule by law\nseems to imply that rulers accept something like the formal discipline\nof legality. Unless the orders issued by the state are general, clear,\nprospective, public, and relatively stable, the state is not ruling by\nlaw. So this thin version of legality does still have moral\nsignificance in the respect it pays to the human need for clarity and\npredictability. Rule by law \u201ccan be a way a government \u2026\nstabilizes and secures expectations\u201d (Goodpaster 2003: 686).\nEven if its use remains instrumental to the purposes of the state, it\ninvolves what Fuller called a bond of reciprocity with the purposes of\nthose who are governed: the latter are assured that the promulgated\nrules are the ones that will be used to evaluate their actions (see\nalso Winston 2005: 316).\n\nSome jurists who maintain the contrast between the Rule of Law and\nrule by law have a more ambitious agenda. They take seriously the\nancient idea that we might be ruled by laws and not by men. One may\nask: how is that supposed to happen? After all, all law is made by\npeople and interpreted by people and applied by people. It can no more\nrule us by itself, without human assistance, than a cannon can\ndominate us without an iron-monger to cast it and an artilleryman to\nload and fire it. The jurists who contrast the Rule of Law with rule\nby law believe they can make this work by focusing on laws whose human\norigins are in some way diffuse or immemorial. We are not necessarily\ntalking here about natural law, but perhaps about something like\ncustomary law or common law\u2014law that is not so evidently a\ntop-down product of powerful human law-makers (Epstein 2011). Common\nlaw grows and develops under its own steam, and need not be conceived\nas a device by which some identifiable humans rule over others. No\ndoubt there is a lot of mythology in this. A more realistic view of\ncommon law identifies it with the deliberate and arbitrary rule of an\nentity that Bentham (1792) called \u201cJudge & Co\u201d. But it\nremains true that the human element is diffuse in this sort of system,\nand at any given time the law that emerges is a resultant of the work\nof many people rather than the intentional product of a domineering\nmajority ruling us from the legislative center of a state.\n\nAs we saw in the discussion of Hayek (1973), the other side of this\ncoin is a disparagement of legislation, precisely because its\nenactment seems patently and undeniably to represent the rule of\npowerful officials. Legislation is a matter of will. The\nlegislative process produces law simply by virtue of a bunch of people\nin an assembly deciding that a given law is to be produced.\nAnd this is done by the very men\u2014powerful politicians\u2014to\nwhose power the Rule of Law is supposed to be an alternative. \n\nHowever, most people who value the Rule of Law do not accept this\napproach. If a statute is properly drafted (if it is clear,\nintelligible and expressed in general terms) and prospectively enacted\nand promulgated, and if it is administered impartially and with due\nprocess\u2014they will call this an entirely appropriate exercise\nunder the Rule of Law. Indeed that is what many scholars mean by the\nRule of Law: people being governed by measures laid down in advance in\ngeneral terms and enforced equally according to the terms in which\nthey have been publicly promulgated. The argument that it should be\nput aside because it does not contrast sufficiently with the rule of\nmen seems perverse.\n\nNo one doubts that legislation can sometimes undermine the Rule of\nLaw, by purporting for example to remove legal accountability from a\nrange of official actions or to preclude the possibility of judicial\nreview of executive action. But this is not a problem with legislation\nas such; this is a concern about the content of particular enactments.\nRule by judges, too, can sometimes be seen as the very sort of rule by\nmen that the Rule of Law is supposed to supersede (see Waldron 2002:\n142\u20133 and 147\u20138). \n",
