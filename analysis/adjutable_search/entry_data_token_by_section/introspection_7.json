    "main_text": "Introspective Versus Non-Introspective Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Introspective Pluralism\n2.4 Introspective Pluralism\n\nPhilosophers discussing self-knowledge often write as if approaches\nhighlighting one of these non-self-detection methods of generating\nself-ascriptions conflict with approaches that highlight other of\nthese non-self-detection methods, and also as if approaches of this\ngeneral sort conflict with self-detection approaches (Section 2.2\nabove). While conflicts will certainly exist between different\naccounts intended to serve as exhaustive approaches to\nself-knowledge, it is implausible that any one or even any few of\nthese approaches to self-knowledge is exhaustive. Plausibly, all of\nthe non-self-detection approaches described above can lead, at least\noccasionally, to accurate self-ascriptions. Enthusiasts for another of\nthe models, or for a self-detection model, needn\u2019t deny this. It\nalso seems hard to deny that we at least sometimes reach\nconclusions about our mental lives based on the kind of theoretical\ninference or self-interpretation emphasized by advocates of self/other\nparity accounts (Section 2.1 above). Finally, even philosophers\nconcerned about strong or oversimple self-scanning views might wish to\ngrant that the mind can do some sort of tracking of its own\npresent or recently past states\u2014for example, when we trace back\na stream of recently past thoughts that presumably can\u2019t\n(because past) be self-ascribed by self-fulfillment, self-shaping,\nself-expression, or transparency methods.\n\nSchwitzgebel (2012) elevates this pluralism into a kind of negative\naccount of introspection. Introspective judgments, he says, arise from\na shifting confluence of many processes, recruited opportunistically,\nnone of which can be called introspection proper. Just as there is no\nsingle, unified faculty of poster-taking-in that one employs when\ntrying to take in a poster at a psychological conference or science\nfair, there is, on Schwitzgebel\u2019s view, no single, unified\nfaculty of introspection or one underlying core process, nor even a\nfew dedicated mechanisms or processes. Instead, the introspector, like\nthe poster-viewer, brings to bear a diverse range of cognitive\nresources as suits the occasion. Although, he says, a process\nwouldn\u2019t be worth calling \u201cintrospective\u201d unless the\nintrospector aimed to reach a judgment about their current or very\nrecently past conscious experience, using at least some resources\nspecific to the first-person case and that exhibit some relatively\ndirect sensitivity to the target state, this limitation does not imply\nthe existence of any dedicated introspective processes. Defenders of\nless extreme versions of pluralism that are compatible with the\nexistence of several dedicated introspective processes include Prinz\n(2004), Hill (2009), Coliva (2016), and Samoilova (2016).\n",
