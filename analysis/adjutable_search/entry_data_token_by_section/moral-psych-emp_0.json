Introduction: What is Moral Psychology?\n\nContemporary moral psychology\u2014the study of human thought and\nbehavior in ethical contexts\u2014is resolutely interdisciplinary:\npsychologists freely draw on philosophical theories to help structure\ntheir empirical research, while philosophers freely draw on empirical\nfindings from psychology to help structure their\n theories.[1]\n\n\nWhile this extensive interdisciplinarity is a fairly recent\ndevelopment (with few exceptions, most of the relevant work dates from\nthe past quarter century), it should not be a surprising development.\nFrom antiquity to the present, philosophers have not been bashful\nabout making empirical claims, and many of these empirical claims have\nbeen claims about human psychology (Doris & Stich 2005). It is\ntherefore unremarkable that, with the emergence of scientific\npsychology over the past century and a half, some of these\nphilosophers would think to check their work against the systematic\nfindings of psychologists (hopefully, while taking special care to\navoid being misled by scientific controversy; see Doris 2015, Chapter\n3; Machery & Doris forthcoming). \n\nSimilarly, at least since the demise of behaviorism, psychologists\nhave been keenly interested in normative phenomena in general and\nethical phenomena in particular. It is therefore unremarkable that\nsome of these psychologists would seek to enrich their theoretical\nframeworks with the conceptual resources of a field intensively\nfocused on normative phenomena: philosophical ethics. As a result, the\nfield demarcated by \u201cmoral psychology\u201d, routinely involves\nan admixture of empirical and normative inquiry, pursued by both\nphilosophers and psychologists\u2014increasingly, in the form of\ncollaborative efforts involving practitioners from both fields. \n\nFor philosophers, the special interest of this interdisciplinary\ninquiry lies in the ways moral psychology may help adjudicate between\ncompeting ethical theories. The plausibility of its associated moral\npsychology is not, of course, the only dimension on which an ethical\ntheory may be evaluated; equally important are normative\nquestions having to do with how well a theory fares when compared to\nimportant convictions about such things as justice, fairness, and the\ngood life. Such questions have been, and will continue to be, of\ncentral importance for philosophical ethics. Nonetheless, it is\ncommonly supposed that an ethical theory committed to an impoverished\nor inaccurate conception of moral psychology is at a serious\ncompetitive disadvantage. As Bernard Williams (1973, 1985; cf.\nFlanagan 1991) forcefully argued, an ethical conception that commends\nrelationships, commitments, or life projects that are at odds with the\nsorts of attachments that can be reasonably expected to take root in\nand vivify actual human lives is an ethical conception with\u2014at\nbest\u2014a very tenuous claim to our assent.\n\nWith this in mind, problems in ethical theory choice making reference\nto moral psychology can be framed by two related inquiries:\n\nWhat empirical claims about human psychology do advocates of\ncompeting perspectives on ethical theory assert or presuppose?\nHow empirically well supported are these claims?\n\n\nThe first question is one of philosophical scholarship: what are the\npsychological commitments of various positions in philosophical\nethics? The second question takes us beyond the corridors of\nphilosophy departments and to the sorts of questions asked, and\nsometimes answered, by the human sciences, including psychology,\nanthropology, sociology, history, cognitive science, linguistics and\nneuroscience. Thus, contemporary moral psychology is\nmethodologically pluralistic: it aims to answer philosophical\nquestions, but in an empirically responsible way.\n\nHowever, it will sometimes be difficult to tell which claims in\nphilosophical ethics require empirical substantiation. Partly, this is\nbecause it is sometimes unclear whether, and to what extent, a\ncontention counts as empirically assessable. Consider questions\nregarding \u201cnormal functioning\u201d in mental health care: are\nthe answers to these questions statistical, or evaluative (Boorse\n1975; Fulford 1989; Murphy 2006)? For example, is \u201cnormal\u201d\nmental health simply the psychological condition of most people, or is\nit good mental health? If the former, the issue is, at least\nin principle, empirically decidable. If the latter, the issues must be\ndecided, if they can be decided, by arguments about value.\n\nAdditionally, philosophers have not always been explicit about\nwhether, and to what extent, they are making empirical claims. For\nexample, are their depictions of moral character meant to identify\npsychological features of actual persons, or to articulate ideals that\nneed not be instantiated in actual human psychologies? Such questions\nwill of course be complicated by the inevitable diversity of\nphilosophical opinion.\n\nIn every instance, therefore, the first task is to carefully document\na theory\u2019s empirically assessable claims, whether they are\nexplicit or, as may often be the case, tacit. Once claims apt for\nempirical assessment have been located, the question becomes one of\nidentifying any relevant empirical literatures. The next job is to\nassess those literatures, in an attempt to determine what conclusions\ncan be responsibly drawn from them. Science, particularly social\nscience, being what it is, many conclusions will be provisional; the\nphilosophical moral psychologist must be prepared to adjudicate\ncontroversies in other fields, or offer informed conjecture regarding\nfuture findings. Often, the empirical record will be crucially\nincomplete. In such cases, philosophers may be forced to engage in\nempirically disciplined conjecture, or even to engage in their own\nempirical work, as some philosophers are beginning to\n do.[2]\n\nWhen the philosophical positions have been isolated, and putatively\nrelevant empirical literatures assessed, we can begin to evaluate the\nplausibility of the philosophical moral psychology: Is the speculative\npicture of psychological functioning that informs some region of\nethical theory compatible with the empirical picture that emerges from\nsystematic observation? In short, is the philosophical picture\nempirically adequate? If it is determined that the\nphilosophical conception is empirically adequate, the result is\nvindicatory. Conversely, if the philosophical moral\npsychology in question is found to be empirically inadequate,\nthe result is revisionary, compelling alteration, or even\nrejection, of those elements of the philosophical theory presupposing\nthe problematic moral psychology. The process will often be\ncomparative. Theory choice in moral psychology, like other\ntheory choice, involves tradeoffs, and while an empirically\nundersupported approach may not be decisively eliminated from\ncontention on empirical grounds alone, it may come to be seen as less\nattractive than theoretical options with firmer empirical\nfoundations.\n\nThe winds driving the sort of disciplinary cross-pollination we\ndescribe do not blow in one direction. As philosophers writing for an\nencyclopedia of philosophy, we are naturally concerned with the ways\nempirical research might shape, or re-shape, philosophical ethics. But\nphilosophical reflection may likewise influence empirical research,\nsince such research is often driven by philosophical suppositions that\nmay be more or less philosophically sound. The best interdisciplinary\nconversations, then, should benefit both parties. To illustrate the\ndialectical process we have described, we will consider a variety of\ntopics in moral psychology. Our primary concerns will be\nphilosophical: What are some of the most central problems in\nphilosophical moral psychology, and how might they be resolved?\nHowever, as the hybrid nature of our topic invites us to do, we will\npursue these questions in an interdisciplinary spirit, and are hopeful\nthat our remarks will also engage interested scientists. Hopefully,\nthe result will be a broad sense of the problems and methods that will\nstructure research on moral psychology during the 21st\ncentury.\n",
