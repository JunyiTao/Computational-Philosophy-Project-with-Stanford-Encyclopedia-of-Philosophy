    "main_text": "A Moral Case for Voluntary Euthanasia\n4. Five Objections to the Moral Permissibility of Voluntary Euthanasia\n4.1 Objection 1\n\nIt is sometimes said (e.g., Emanuel 1999; Keown in Jackson and Keown\n2012) that it is not necessary nowadays for people to die while\nsuffering from intolerable or overwhelming pain because the provision\nof effective palliative care has improved steadily, and hospice care\nis more widely available. Some have urged, in consequence, that\nvoluntary euthanasia is unnecessary.\n\nThere are several flaws in this contention. First, while both good\npalliative care and hospice care make important contributions to the\ncare of the dying, neither is a panacea. To get the best palliative\ncare for an individual involves trial and error, with some consequent\nsuffering in the process; moreover, even the best care fails to\nrelieve all pain and suffering. Perhaps even more importantly, high\nquality palliative care commonly exacts a price in the form of\nside-effects such as nausea, incontinence, loss of awareness because\nof semi-permanent drowsiness, and so on. A rosy picture is often\npainted as to how palliative care can transform the plight of the\ndying. Such a picture is misleading according to those who have\nclosely observed the effect of extended courses of treatment with\ndrugs like morphine. For these reasons many skilled palliative care\nspecialists acknowledge that palliative care does not enable an\neaseful death for every patient. Second, even though the sort of care\nprovided through hospices is to be applauded, it is care that is\navailable to only a small proportion of the terminally ill and then\nusually only in the very last stages of the illness (typically a\nmatter of a few weeks). Notwithstanding that only relatively few of\nthe dying have access to hospice care it is worth drawing attention to\nthe fact that in, Oregon, to cite one example, a high proportion of\nthose who have sought physician-assisted suicide were in hospice care.\nThird, and of greatest significance for present purposes, not everyone\nwishes to avail themselves of palliative or hospice care. For those\nwho prefer to die on their own terms and in their own time, neither\noption may be attractive. As previously mentioned, a major source of\ndistress for many dying patients is the frustration that comes with\nbeing unable to satisfy their autonomous wishes. Fourth, as also\nindicated earlier, the suffering that occasions a desire to end life\nis not always traceable to pain caused by illness. For some, what is\nintolerable is their forced dependence on others or on life-supporting\nmachinery; for these patients, the availability of effective pain\ncontrol is not the primary concern. (In relation to the preceding\nmatters see Rietjens, et al., 2009 and Onwuteaka-Philipsen et al. 2012\nfor findings for The Netherlands; and, for Oregon, Ganzini, et al.\n2009.)\n4.2 Objection 2\n\nA second, related objection to the moral and legal permissibility of\nvoluntary euthanasia turns on the claim that we can never have\nsufficient evidence to be justified in believing that a dying\nperson\u2019s request to be helped to die is competent, enduring and\ngenuinely voluntary.\n\nIt is certainly true that a request to die may not reflect an enduring\ndesire to die (just as some attempts to commit suicide may reflect\nonly temporary despair). That is why advocates of the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia have argued that a cooling off period should\nnormally be required before euthanasia is permitted to ensure that the\nrequest is enduring. That having been said, to claim that we can never\nbe justified in believing that someone\u2019s request to die reflects\na settled preference for death is to go too far. If a competent person\ndiscusses the issue with others on different occasions over time, and\nremains steady in her resolve, or privately reflects on the issue for\nan extended period and does not waver in her conviction, her wish to\ndie surely must be counted as enduring.\n\nBut, it might be asked, what if a person is racked with pain, or\nmentally confused because of the measures taken to relieve her pain,\nand is, in consequence, unable to think clearly and rationally about\nthe alternatives? It has to be agreed that a person in those\ncircumstances who wants to die should not be assumed to have a truly\nvoluntary and enduring desire to die. However, there are at least two\nimportant points to make about those in such circumstances. First,\nthey do not account for all of the terminally ill, so even if it is\nacknowledged that such people are incapable of agreeing to voluntary\neuthanasia that does not show that no one can ever voluntarily request\nhelp to die. Second, it is possible in at least some jurisdictions for\na person to indicate, in advance of losing the capacity to give\ncompetent consent, how she would wish to be treated should she become\nterminally ill and suffer either intolerable pain or an unacceptable\nloss of control over her life (cf., for instance, Dworkin 1993).\n\u2018Living wills\u2019 or \u2018advance directives\u2019 are\nlegal instruments for giving voice to people\u2019s wishes while they\nare capable of giving competent, enduring and voluntary consent,\nincluding to their wanting help to die. As long as they are easily\nrevocable in the event of a change of mind (just as civil wills are),\nthey should be respected as evidence of a well thought-out conviction.\n(For more detailed consideration of these instruments see the entry on\n advance directives.)\n\nPerhaps, though, what is really at issue in this objection is whether\nanyone can ever form a competent, enduring and voluntary\njudgement about being better off dead, rather than continuing to\nsuffer from an illness, prior to suffering such an illness\n(cf., Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012). If this is what underlies the\nobjection it is surely too paternalistic to be acceptable. Why is it\nnot possible for a person to have sufficient inductive evidence (e.g.,\nbased on the experience of the deaths of friends or family) to know\nher own mind, and act accordingly, without having had direct\nexperience of such suffering?\n4.3 Objection 3\n\nAccording to the traditional interpretation of the \u2018doctrine of\ndouble effect\u2019 it is permissible to act in a way which it is\nforeseen will have a bad effect, provided only that\n\nthe bad effect occurs as a side-effect (i.e., indirectly) to the\nachievement of the act that is directly aimed at;\nthe act directly aimed at is itself morally good or, at least,\nmorally neutral;\nthe good effect is not achieved by way of the bad, that is, the\nbad must not be a means to the good; and\nthe bad effect must not be so serious as to outweigh the good\neffect.\n\n\nHence, it is permissible, according to the doctrine of double effect,\nto, for example, alleviate pain (a good effect) by administering a\ndrug such as morphine, knowing that doing so will shorten life, but\nimpermissible to administer the same drug with the direct intention of\nterminating a patient\u2019s life (a bad effect). This latter claim\nis said to apply regardless of whether the drug is given at the\nperson\u2019s request.\n\nThis is not the appropriate forum for a full consideration of the\ndoctrine, for which see the entry on the\n doctrine of double effect.\n However, there is one very important criticism to be made of the\napplication of the doctrine that has direct relevance to the issue of\nvoluntary euthanasia.\n\nOn the most plausible reading, the doctrine of double effect can be\nrelevant to the permissibility of voluntary euthanasia only when a\nperson\u2019s death is bad for her or, to put it another way, a\nharm to her. Sometimes the notion of \u2018harm\u2019 is\nunderstood simply as damage to a person\u2019s interests whether\nconsented to or not. At other times, it is understood, more strictly,\nas damage that has been wrongfully inflicted. On either understanding\nof harm, there can be instances in which death for a person does not\nconstitute a harm for her because it will either render her better\noff, or, as some would insist, no worse off, when compared with\nremaining alive. Accordingly, in those instances, the doctrine of\ndouble effect can have no relevance to the debate about the\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia. (For extended discussions of\nthe doctrine of double effect and its bearing on the moral\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia see, e.g., McIntyre 2001;\nWoodward 2001; Cavanaugh 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.)\n4.4 Objection 4\n\nAs was noted earlier in Section 3, there is a widespread belief\nconcerning the moral acceptability of so-called passive (voluntary)\neuthanasia, wherein life-sustaining or life-prolonging measures are\nwithdrawn or withheld in response to a competent patient\u2019s\nrequest. The reason why passive (voluntary) euthanasia is said to be\nmorally permissible is that the patient is simply allowed to die\nbecause steps are not taken to preserve or prolong life. This happens,\nfor example, when a dying patient requests the withdrawal or the\nwithholding of measures whose administration would be medically\nfutile, or unacceptably burdensome. By contrast, active (voluntary)\neuthanasia is said to be morally impermissible because it is claimed\nto require an unjustifiable intentional act of killing to satisfy the\npatient\u2019s request (cf., for example, Finnis, 1995; Keown in\nJackson and Keown 2012).\n\nDespite its popularity and widespread use, the distinction between\npassive and active euthanasia is neither particularly clear nor\nmorally helpful. (For a fuller discussion, see McMahan 2002.) Whether\nbehavior is described in terms of acts or omissions (a distinction\nwhich underpins the alleged difference between active and passive\nvoluntary euthanasia and that between killing a person and letting her\ndie), is often a matter of pragmatics rather than anything of deeper\nmoral importance. Consider, for instance, the practice (once common in\nhospitals) of deliberately proceeding slowly to a ward in response to\na request to provide assistance for a patient who has been assigned a\n\u2018not for resuscitation\u2019 code. Or, consider \u2018pulling\nthe plug\u2019 on a respirator keeping an otherwise dying patient\nalive, as against not replacing the oxygen supply when it runs out.\nAre these acts or omissions? If the answers turn on merely pragmatic\nconsiderations the supposed distinction between passive euthanasia and\nactive euthanasia will be hard to sustain.\n\nEven supposing that the distinction between acts and omissions, and\nthe associated distinction between killing and letting die, can be\nsatisfactorily clarified (on which see the entry\n doing v. allowing harm),\n there remains the issue of whether these distinctions have moral\nsignificance in any particular circumstance. Consider a case of a\npatient suffering from motor neurone disease who is completely\nrespirator dependent, finds her condition intolerable, and competently\nand persistently requests to be removed from the respirator so that\nshe may die. Even the Catholic Church in recent times has been\nprepared to agree that it is permissible, in a case like this, to turn\noff the respirator. No doubt this has been because the Catholic Church\nconsiders such a patient is only being allowed to die. Even were it to\nbe agreed, for the sake of argument, that such a death should be\nregarded as an instance of letting die, this concession would not show\nthat it would have been morally worse had the patient been killed at\nher request (active voluntary euthanasia) rather than being allowed to\ndie (passive voluntary euthanasia). Indeed, supporters of voluntary\nmedically assisted death maintain that since death is beneficial in\nsuch an instance (or, at the very least, leaves the dying person no\nworse off), actively bringing about the death is morally to be\npreferred to just allowing it to happen because the desired benefit is\nachieved sooner.\n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia claim, however, that the difference\nbetween active and passive euthanasia is to be found in the\nagent\u2019s intention: if someone\u2019s life is\nintentionally terminated she has been killed, whereas if she\nis just no longer being aggressively treated, her death should be\nattributed to the underlying disease. Many physicians would say that\ntheir intention in withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining medical\ntreatment in such circumstances is simply to respect the\npatient\u2019s wishes. This is plausible in those instances where the\npatient competently requests that aggressive treatment no longer be\ngiven (or, the patient\u2019s proxy makes such a request). But it\nwill often be implausible. In many cases the most plausible\ninterpretation of a physician\u2019s intention in withholding or\nwithdrawing life-sustaining measures is that it is to end the\npatient\u2019s life. Consider the palliative care practice of\n\u2018terminally sedating\u2019 a patient after a decision has been\nmade to cease aggressive treatment. Suppose (as sometimes happens)\nthat this is then followed by withholding artificially supplied\nnutrition. In these latter instances the best explanation of the\nphysician\u2019s behavior is that the physician intends thereby to\nend the life of the patient. What could be the point of the action,\nthe goal aimed at, the intended outcome, if not to end the\npatient\u2019s life? (Cf. Winkler 1995.) No sense can be made of the\naction as being intended to palliate the patient\u2019s diseased\ncondition, or to keep the patient comfortable. Nor is it appropriate\nto claim that what kills the patient is the underlying disease. What\nkills the patient is the act of depriving her of nutrition (i.e., of\nstarving her to death). The point can be generalized to cover many\nmore instances involving either the withdrawal or the withholding of\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. In short, there is no good reason\nto think that whereas so-called passive voluntary euthanasia is\nmorally acceptable active voluntary euthanasia never can be.\n\nBut we can go further. Giving titrated doses of morphine that reach\nlevels beyond those needed to control pain, or removing a respirator\nfrom a sufferer from motor neurone disease, seem to many of us to\namount to intentionally bringing about the death of the person being\ncared for. To be sure, as was acknowledged above, there are\ncircumstances in which doctors can truthfully say that the actions\nthey perform, or omissions they make, will bring about the deaths of\ntheir patients even though it was not their intention that those\npatients would die. So, for instance, if a patient refuses\nlife-prolonging medical treatment because she considers it futile, it\ncan be reasonable to say that her doctor\u2019s intention in\ncomplying with the request was simply to respect her wishes.\nNevertheless, as we have seen, there are other circumstances in which\nit is highly stilted to claim, as some doctors continue to do, that\nthey had no intention of bringing about death.\n\nThese considerations should settle matters but do not do so for those\nwho maintain that killing, in medical contexts, is always morally\nunjustified \u2013 a premise that underwrites much of the debate\nsurrounding this fourth objection. But this underlying assumption is\nopen to challenge and has been challenged by, for instance, Rachels\n1986 and McMahan 2002. One of the reasons the challengers have given\nis that there are cases in which killing a competent dying person when\nshe requests assistance with dying, is morally preferable to allowing\nher to die, namely, when taking the latter option would serve only to\nprolong her suffering against her wishes. Further, despite the\nlongstanding legal doctrine that no one can justifiably consent to be\nkilled (on which more later), it surely is relevant to the\njustification of an act of killing that the person killed has\nautonomously decided that she would be better off dead and so asks to\nbe helped to die.\n4.5 Objection 5\n\nIt is sometimes said that if society allows voluntary\neuthanasia to be legalized, we will then have set foot on a slippery\nslope that will lead us eventually to support other forms of\neuthanasia, including, in particular, non-voluntary euthanasia.\nWhereas it was once the common refrain that that was precisely what\nhappened in Hitler\u2019s Germany, in recent decades the tendency has\nbeen to claim that experience with legalized euthanasia in The\nNetherlands and Belgium, in particular, has confirmed the reality of\nthe slippery slope.\n\nSlippery slope arguments come in various versions. One (but not the\nonly) way of classifying them has been to refer to logical,\npsychological and arbitrary line versions. The common feature of the\ndifferent forms is the contention that once the first step is taken on\na slippery slope the subsequent steps follow inexorably, whether for\nlogical reasons, psychological reasons, or to avoid arbitrariness in\n\u2018drawing a line\u2019 between a person\u2019s actions. (For\nfurther discussion see, e.g., Rachels 1986; Brock 1992; Walton\n1992.)\n\nWe need first to consider whether, at the theoretical level, any of\nthese forms of argument is powerful enough to refute the case for the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia. We will then be in a position to\ncomment on the alleged empirical support from the experiences of\nHitler\u2019s Germany and, more recently, of legalized euthanasia in\nThe Netherlands and elsewhere, for the existence of a slippery slope\nthat will supposedly come into being with the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia.\n\nTo begin with, there is nothing logically inconsistent in supporting\nvoluntary euthanasia while maintaining the moral inappropriateness of\nnon-voluntary euthanasia. Undoubtedly, some advocates of voluntary\neuthanasia wish also to lend their support to some acts of\nnon-voluntary euthanasia, for example, for those in persistent\nvegetative states who have never indicated their wishes about being\nhelped to die, or for certain severely disabled infants for whom the\noutlook is hopeless. (See, e.g., Kuhse and Singer 1985; Singer 1994;\nStingl 2010; Sumner 2017.) Others believe that the consent of the\npatient is strictly required if euthanasia is appropriately to be\nlegalized. The difference is not a matter of logical acumen; it is to\nbe explained by reference to the importance placed on key values by\nthe respective supporters. Thus, for example, those who insist on the\nnecessity for a competent patient request for medical assistance with\ndying typically believe that such a request is the paramount\nconsideration in end-of-life decision making (even when it is\nharnessed to the value of individual well-being), whereas those who\nconsider a person\u2019s best interests to be the paramount\nconsideration are more likely to believe in the justifiability of\ninstances of non-voluntary euthanasia like those mentioned above.\n\nNext, it is hard to see why moving from voluntary to non-voluntary\neuthanasia is supposed to be psychologically inevitable. Why should\nthose who support the legalization of voluntary euthanasia, because\nthey value the autonomy of the individual, find it psychologically\neasier, in consequence, to endorse the killing of those who are not\nable competently to request assistance with dying? What reason is\nthere to believe that they will, as a result of their support for\nvoluntary euthanasia, be psychologically driven to endorse a practice\nof non-voluntary euthanasia?\n\nFinally, since there is nothing arbitrary about distinguishing\nvoluntary euthanasia from non-voluntary euthanasia (because the line\nbetween them is based on clear principles), there can be no substance\nto the charge that only by arbitrarily drawing a line between them\ncould non-voluntary euthanasia be avoided were voluntary euthanasia to\nbe legalized.\n\nWhat, though, of Hitler\u2019s Germany and the recent experience of\nlegalized voluntary euthanasia in The Netherlands and elsewhere? The\nformer is easily dismissed as an indication of an inevitable descent\nfrom voluntary euthanasia to non-voluntary. There never was a policy\nin favor of, or a legal practice of, voluntary euthanasia in Germany\nin the 1920s to the 1940s (see, for example, Burleigh 1994). There\nwas, prior to Hitler coming to power, a clear practice of killing some\ndisabled persons. But it was never suggested that their being killed\nwas justified by reference to their best interests; rather,\nit was said that society would be benefited. Hitler\u2019s later\nrevival of the practice and its widening to take in other groups such\nas Jews and gypsies was part of a program of eugenics, not\neuthanasia.\n\nSince the publication of the Remmelink Report in 1991 into the medical\npractice of euthanasia in The Netherlands, it has frequently been said\nthat the Dutch experience shows that legally protecting voluntary\neuthanasia is impossible without also affording shelter to the\nnon-voluntary euthanasia that will follow in its train (see, e.g.,\nKeown 2002). In the period since that report there have been a further\nfour national studies of the practice of euthanasia in The\nNetherlands. These studies were carried out in 1995, 2001, 2005 and\n2010 respectively (see, e.g., Rietjens, et al. 2009;\nOnwuteaka-Philipsen, et al. 2012). The findings from these national\nstudies have consistently shown that there is no evidence for the\nexistence of such a slippery slope. Among the specific findings the\nfollowing are worth mentioning: of those terminally ill persons who\nhave been assisted to die about sixty per cent have clearly been cases\nof voluntary euthanasia as it has been characterised in this entry; of\nthe remainder, the vast majority of cases were of patients who at the\ntime of their medically assisted deaths were no longer competent. It\nmight be thought that these deaths ought to be regarded as instances\nof non-voluntary euthanasia. But, in fact, it would be inappropriate\nto regard them as such. Here is why. For the overwhelming majority of\nthese cases, the decisions to end life were taken only after\nconsultation between the attending doctor(s) and close family members,\nand so can legitimately be thought of as involving substituted\njudgements. Moreover, according to the researchers, the overwhelming\nmajority of these cases fit within either of two common practices that\noccur in countries where voluntary euthanasia has not been legalized,\nnamely, that of terminal sedation of dying patients, and that of\ngiving large doses of opioids to relieve pain while foreseeing that\nthis will also end life. In a very few cases, there was no\nconsultation with relatives, though in those cases there were\nconsultations with other medical personnel. The researchers contend\nthat these instances are best explained by the fact that families in\nThe Netherlands strictly have no final legal authority to act as\nsurrogate decision-makers for incompetent persons. For these reasons\nthe researchers maintain that non-voluntary euthanasia is not widely\npractised in The Netherlands.\n\nThat there have only been a handful of prosecutions of Dutch doctors\nfor failing to follow agreed procedures (Griffiths, et al., 1998),\nthat none of the doctors prosecuted has had a significant penalty\nimposed, that a significant proportion of requests for medical\nassistance with dying are rejected as unjustifiable, and that the\nDutch public have regularly reaffirmed their support for the agreed\nprocedures suggests that, contrary to the claims of some critics, the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia has not increased the incidence\nof non-voluntary euthanasia. A similar picture to the one in The\nNetherlands has emerged from studies of the operation of the law\nconcerning physician-assisted suicide in Oregon. Indeed, in a recent\nwide-ranging study of attitudes and practices of voluntary euthanasia\nand physician-assisted suicide covering two continents, a prominent\ncritic of these practices has concluded (in agreement with his\nco-authors) that little evidence exists of abuse, particularly of the\nvulnerable (see Emanuel, et al., 2016). Unfortunately, insufficient\ntime has elapsed for appropriate studies to be conducted in the other\njurisdictions that have legalized either voluntary euthanasia or\nphysician-assisted suicide. Finally, some commentators have pointed\nout that there may, in reality, be more danger of the line between\nvoluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia being blurred if euthanasia is\npractised in the absence of legal recognition, since there will, in\nthose circumstances, be neither transparency nor monitoring (which\ncannot be said of The Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and so on).\n\nNone of this is to suggest that it is not necessary to ensure the\npresence of safeguards against potential abuse of legally protected\nvoluntary euthanasia. This is particularly important for the\nprotection of those who have become incompetent by the time decisions\nneed to be taken about whether to assist them to die. Furthermore, it\nis, of course, possible that the reform of any law may have unintended\neffects. However, if the arguments outlined above are sound (and the\nexperience in the The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, along with\nthe more limited experience in several states in the United States,\nis, for the present, not only the best evidence we have that they are\nsound, but the only relevant evidence), that does not seem\nvery likely.\n\nIt is now well-established in many jurisdictions that competent\npatients are entitled to make their own decisions about\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. That is why they can refuse such\ntreatment even when doing so is tantamount to deciding to end their\nlife. It is plausible to think that the fundamental basis of the right\nto decide about life-sustaining treatment \u2013 respect for a\nperson\u2019s autonomy and her assessment of what will best serve her\nwell-being \u2013 has direct relevance to the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia (see, e.g., Dworkin in Frey et al., 1998; Young\n2007, 2017; Sumner 2011). In consequence, extending the right of\nself-determination to cover cases of voluntary euthanasia does not\nrequire a dramatic shift in legal policy. Nor do any novel legal\nvalues or principles need to be invoked. Indeed, the fact that suicide\nand attempted suicide are no longer criminal offences in many\njurisdictions indicates that the central importance of individual\nself-determination in a closely analogous context has been accepted.\nThe fact that voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have\nnot been more widely decriminalized is perhaps best explained along a\nsimilar line to the one that has frequently been offered for excluding\nthe consent of the victim as a justification for an act of killing,\nnamely the difficulties thought to exist in establishing the\ngenuineness of the consent. But, the establishment of suitable\nprocedures for giving consent to voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide is surely no harder than establishing\nprocedures for competently refusing burdensome or otherwise unwanted\nmedical treatment. The latter has already been accomplished in many\njurisdictions, so the former should be achievable as well.\n\nSuppose that the moral case for legalizing voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide does come to be judged more widely as\nstronger than the case against legalization, and they are made legally\npermissible in more jurisdictions than at present. Should doctors take\npart in the practice? Should only doctors perform voluntary\neuthanasia? These questions ought to be answered in light of the best\nunderstanding of what it is to provide medical care. The proper\nadministration of medical care should promote the welfare of patients\nwhile respecting their individual self-determination. It is these twin\nvalues that should guide medical care, not the preservation of life at\nall costs, or the preservation of life without regard to whether\npatients want their lives prolonged should they judge that life is no\nlonger of benefit or value to them. Many doctors in those\njurisdictions where medically assisted death has been legalized and,\nto judge from available survey evidence, in other liberal democracies\nas well, see the practice of voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide as not only compatible with their\nprofessional commitments but also with their conception of the best\nmedical care for the dying. That being so, doctors of the same\nconviction in jurisdictions in which voluntary medically assisted\ndeath is currently illegal should no longer be prohibited by law from\nlending their professional assistance to competent terminally ill\npersons who request assistance with dying because of irremediable\nsuffering or because their lives no longer have value for them.\n",
