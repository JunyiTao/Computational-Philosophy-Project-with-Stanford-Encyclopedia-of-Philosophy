Whereas\nscholars in the Islamic East used Avicenna for studying\nfalsafa, Averroes commented the letter of Aristotle\u2019s\ntext, as the Baghdad Peripatetics had done. He wrote short and\n\u201cMiddle\u201d paraphrase commentaries on almost the entire\nAristotelian corpus, and \u201cGreat\u201d (detailed section by\nsection expositions) on some of the texts. These detailed expositions\nof Aristotle proved invaluable to the Jewish and Christian scholars\nwho read them in translation\n (\u00a71.3.3,\n \u00a71.3.4), although his interpretation of On the Soul in\nhis Great commentary would prove very controversial\n (\u00a73.3)\n (see also entry on\n Ibn Rushd\u2019s natural philosophy)\n .\n\nMoses ben Maimon\n (Maimonides\n in Latin; in Jewish scholarship \u201cRambam\u201d;\n1138\u20131204) was educated in Spain (see entry on\n the influence of Islamic thought on Maimonides)\n but was forced to flee by Almohad policy and settled in Egypt. Like\nAverroes, Maimonides looked back to Aristotle himself and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, and believed that Aristotle had achieved as\nperfect a science as possible. But how far was that science compatible\nwith Jewish teaching? In his voluminous writings on Jewish law, he\nseems to have been willing to accept Aristotelian demonstration as\nproviding the literal truth. In the Guide of the Perplexed,\nwritten late in his life, Maimonides undertakes a profound\ninvestigation of this\u00a0question of (in)compatibility, ostensibly\narguing against Aristotle\u2019s central contention that the world is\neternal\n (\u00a73.1),\n which, he says, destroys Jewish law. At the beginning of the\nGuide, however, he explains that he will sometimes disguise\nhis meaning, and some scholars believe that, correctly interpreted,\nthe Guide supports the Aristotelian view, whilst others see\nits ultimate conclusions as\n sceptical.[17]\n",
