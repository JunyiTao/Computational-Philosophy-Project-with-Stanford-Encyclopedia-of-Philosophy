    "main_text": "Epistemological Unities || Reduction\n3.1 Reduction\n\nThe project of unity, as mentioned above, has long guided models of\nscientific understanding by privileging descriptions of more\nfundamental entities and phenomena such as the powers and behaviors of\natoms, molecules and machines. Since at least the 1920s and until the\n1960s, unity was understood in terms of formal approaches to theories,\nof semantic relations between vocabularies and of logical relations\nbetween linguistic statements in those vocabularies. The ideal of\nunity was formulated, accordingly, in terms of reduction relations to\nmore fundamental terms and statements. Different accounts have since\nstood and fallen with any such commitments. Also, note that\nidentifying relations of reduction must be distinguished from\nthe ideal of reductionism. Reductionism is the adoption of\nreduction relations as the global ideal or standard of a proper\nunified structure of scientific knowledge; and distance from that\nideal was considered a measure of its unifying progress.\n\nIn general, reduction reconciles ontological and epistemological\nconsiderations of identity and difference. Claims such as\n\u201cmental states are reduceable to neurochemical states\u201d,\n\u201cchemical differences reduce to differences between atomic\nstructures\u201d and \u201coptics can be reduced to\nelectromagnetism\u201d imply the truth of identity\nstatements\u2014a strong ontological reduction. However, the\nrelations of reduction between entities or properties in such claims\nalso get additional epistemic value from the expressed semantic\ndiversity of conceptual content and the asymmetry of the relation\ndescribed in such claims between the reducing and the reduced\nclaims\u2014concepts, laws, theories, etc. (Riel 2014).\n\nElimination and eliminativism are the extreme forms of reduction and\nreductionism that commit to aligning the epistemic content with the\nontological content fixed by the identity statements: since only x\nexists and claims about x best meet scientific goals, only talk of x\nmerits scientific consideration and use.\n\nTwo formulations of unification in the logical positivist tradition of\nthe ideal logical structure of science placed the question of unity at\nthe core of philosophy of science: Carl Hempel\u2019s\ndeductive-nomological model of explanation and Ernst Nagel\u2019s\nmodel of reduction. Both are fundamentally epistemological models, and\nboth are specifically explanatory, at least in the sense that\nexplanation serves unification. The emphasis on language and logical\nstructure makes explanatory reduction a form of unity of the\nsynchronic kind. Still, Nagel\u2019s model of reduction is a model of\nscientific structure and explanation as well as of scientific\nprogress. It is based on the problem of relating different theories as\ndifferent sets of theoretical predicates (Nagel 1961).\n\nReduction requires two conditions: connectability and\nderivability. Connectability of laws of different theories\nrequires meaning invariance in the form of extensional\nequivalence between descriptions, with bridge principles between\ncoextensive but distinct terms in different theories.\n\nNagel\u2019s account distinguishes two kinds of reductions:\nhomogenous and heterogeneous. When both sets of\nterms overlap, the reduction is homogeneous. When the related terms\nare different, the reduction is heterogeneous. Derivability requires a\ndeductive relation between the laws involved. In the quantitative\nsciences, the derivation often involves taking a limit. In this sense\nthe reduced science is considered an approximation to the\nreducing new one.\n\nNeo-Nagelian accounts have attempted to solve Nagel\u2019s problem of\nreduction between putatively incompatible theories. The following\nparagraphs list a few.\n\nNagel\u2019s two-term relation account has been modified by weaker\nconditions of analogy and a role for conventions, requiring it to be\nsatisfied not necessarily by the two original theories, \\(T_1\\) and\n\\(T_2\\), which are respectively new and old and more and less general,\nbut by the modified theories \\(T'_1\\) and \\(T'_2\\). Explanatory\nreduction is strictly a four-term relation in which \\(T'_1\\) is\n\u201cstrongly analogous\u201d to \\(T_1\\) and corrects, with the\ninsight that the more fundamental theory can offer, the older theory,\n\\(T_2\\), changing it to \\(T'_2\\). Nagel\u2019s account also requires\nthat bridge laws be synthetic identities, in the sense that they be\nfactual, empirically discoverable and testable; in weaker accounts,\nadmissible bridge laws may include elements of convention (Schaffner\n1967; Sarkar 1998). The difficulty lay especially with the task of\nspecifying or giving a non-contextual, transitive account of the\nrelations between \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) (Wimsatt 1976).\n\nAn alternative set of semantic and syntactic conditions of reduction\nbears counterfactual interpretations. For instance, syntactic\nconditions may take the form of limit relations (e.g., classical\nmechanics reduces to relativistic mechanics for the value of the speed\nof light c\uf0e0 0 and to quantum mechanics for the value of the\nPlanck constant h\uf0e0 0) and ceteris paribus assumptions\n(e.g., when optical laws can be identified with results of the theory\nof electromagnetism); then, each condition helps explain why the\nreduced theory works where it does and fails where it does not\n(Glymour 1969).\n\nA different approach to reductionism acknowledges a commitment to\nproviding explanation but rejects the value of a focus on the role of\nlaws. This approach typically draws a distinction between hard\nsciences such as physics and chemistry and special sciences such as\nbiology and the social sciences. It claims that laws that are in a\nsense operative in the hard sciences are not available in the special\nones, or play a more limited and weaker role, and this on account of\nhistorical character, complexity or reduced scope. The rejection of\nempirical laws in biology, for instance, has been argued on grounds of\nhistorical dependence on contingent initial conditions (Beatty 1995),\nand as matter of supervenience (see the entry on\n supervenience)\n of spatio-temporally restricted functional claims on lower-level\nmolecular ones, and the multiple realization (see the entry on\n multiple realizability)\n of the former by the latter (Rosenberg 1994; Rosenberg\u2019s\nargument from supervenience to reduction without laws must be\ncontrasted with Fodor\u2019s physicalism about the special sciences\nabout laws without reduction (see below and the entry on\n physicalism);\n for a criticism of these views see Sober 1996). This non-Nagelian\napproach assumes further that explanation rests on identities between\npredicates and deductive derivations (reduction and explanation might\nbe said to be justified by derivations, but not constituted by them;\nsee Spector 1978). Explanation is provided by lower-level mechanisms;\ntheir explanatory role is to replace final why-necessarily questions\n(functional) with proximate how-possibly questions (molecular).\n\n\n\nOne suggestion to make sense of the possibility of the supervening\nfunctional explanations without Nagelian reduction may rely on an\nontological type of relation of reduction such as the composition of\npowers in explanatory mechanisms (Gillette 2010, 2016). The reductive\ncommitment to the lower level is based on relations of composition, at\nplay in epistemological analysis and metaphysical synthesis, but is\nmerely formal and derivational. We may be able to infer what composes\nthe higher level, but we cannot simply get all the relevant knowledge\nof the higher level from our knowledge of the lower level (see also\nAuyang 1998). This kind of proposal points to epistemic\nanti-reductionism.\n\nNote that significant proposals of reductive unity rely on ontological\nassumptions about some hierarchy of levels organizing reality and\nscientific theories of it (more below).\n\nA more general characterization views reductionism as a research\nstrategy. On this methodological view reductionism can be\ncharacterized by a set of so-called heuristics (non-algorithmic,\nefficient, error-based, purpose-oriented, problem-solving tasks)\n(Wimsatt 2006): heuristics of conceptualization (e.g., descriptive\nlocalization of properties, system-environment interface determinism,\nlevel and entity-dependence), heuristics of model-building and theory\nconstruction (e.g., model intra-systemic localization with emphasis of\nstructural properties over functional ones, contextual simplification\nand external generalization) and heuristics of observation and\nexperimental design (e.g., focused observation, environmental control,\nlocal scope of testing, abstract shared properties, behavioral\nregularity and context-independence of results).\n",
