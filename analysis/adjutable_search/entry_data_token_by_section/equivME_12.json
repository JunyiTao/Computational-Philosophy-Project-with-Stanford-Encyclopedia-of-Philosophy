    "main_text": "Philosophical interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) || Ontological interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n2.5 Ontological interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n\nEinstein and Infeld (1938) and Zahar (1989) have both argued that\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) has ontological consequences. Both of the\nEinstein-Infeld and Zahar interpretations begin by adopting the\nsame-property interpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). Thus,\naccording to both interpretations, mass and energy are the same\nproperties of physical systems. Furthermore, both the Einstein-Infeld\nand Zahar interpretations use a rudimentary distinction between\n\u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cfields.\u201d According to this\nsomewhat dated distinction, classical physics includes two fundamental\nsubstances: matter, by which one means ponderable material stuff, and\nfields, by which one means physical fields such as the electromagnetic\nfield. For both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar, matter and fields in\nclassical physics are distinguished by the properties they bear.\nMatter has both mass and energy, whereas fields only have energy.\nHowever, since the equivalence of mass and energy entails that mass\nand energy are really the same physical property after all, say\nEinstein and Infeld and Zahar, one can no longer distinguish between\nmatter and fields, as both now have both mass and energy.\n\nAlthough both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar use the same basic\nargument, they reach slightly different conclusions. Zahar argues that\nmass-energy equivalence entails that the fundamental stuff of physics\nis a sort of \u201cI-know-not-what\u201d that can manifest itself as\neither matter or field. Einstein and Infeld, on the other hand, in\nplaces seem to argue that we can infer that the fundamental stuff of\nphysics is fields. In other places, however, Einstein and Infeld seem\na bit more cautious and suggest only that one can construct a physics\nwith only fields in its ontology.\n\nThe demerits of either ontological interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence are that it rests upon the same-property\ninterpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). As we have discussed above (see\n Section 2.4),\n while one can adopt the same-property\ninterpretation, to do so one must make additional assumptions\nconcerning the nature of matter. Furthermore, the ontological\ninterpretation rests on what nowadays seems like a rather crude\ndistinction between \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cfields.\u201d To\nbe sure, mass-energy equivalence has figured prominently in\nphysicists\u2019 conception of matter in no small part because it\ndoes open up the door to a description of what we ordinarily regard as\nponderable matter in terms of fields, since the energy of the field at\none level can manifest itself as mass one level up. However, the\ninference from mass-energy equivalence to the fundamental ontology of\nmodern physics seems far more subtle than either Enstein and Infeld or\nZahar suggest.\n",
