    "main_text": "Naturalism || Forms of Naturalism\n4.1 Forms of Naturalism\n\nWhen we have decided that someone\u2019s biological systems do not function\nproperly, we still face the question, how should we think about that\nperson\u2019s condition? Naturalists usually admit that there is more to\nthe concept of disease than biological malfunction even if they think\nthat biological malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. This\ninvolves a two-stage picture (Murphy 2006, ch 2) which inverts the\nconstructivist portrayal of our practice. Naturalists who buy the two\nstage picture think that, first, we agree on the biological facts\nabout malfunction. At the second stage we make the normative judgment\nthat the person with the malfunction is suffering in some way. (This\nis the order of conceptual priority, not the chronological sequence in\nwhich judgments are made.) Spitzer and Endicott (1978, 18) for\nexample, say that disease categories are \u201ccalls to\naction\u201d; assertions that something has gone wrong within a\nperson\u2019s body in a way that produces consequences we think we need to\nremedy (see also Papineau 1994).\n\nNormative considerations, on this account, inform our judgments about\ndisease but do not have the conceptual priority accorded them by\nconstructivists. We make judgments that someone is suffering in ways\nwe associate with inner malfunction. We also see people who are\nsuffering but who we don\u2019t think are ill or injured, because we do not\nregard their bodily dysfunction as symptoms of disease: vaccination,\nsurgical incisions, ear-piercing or childbirth are examples. Or\nimagine a skin condition that in some cultures causes the sufferer to\nbe worshiped as a god, or become a sought-after sexual partner. The\ntwo-stage picture is designed to distinguish between the physical\nabnormality and the difference it makes to the life of the person who\nhas it. The idea is that whether someone\u2019s body is not functioning\ncorrectly is a separate question from whether it is bad to be like\nthat. Stegenga (2018, p.23) calls such a theory a hybrid account, as\nit argues both that \"there is a constitutive causal basis of disease\nand a normative basis of disease.\" He also adds a fourth alternative,\nwhich he calls eliminativist, arguing for replacing the notion of\ndisease with successor notions tied more closely to the science. This\ngoes beyond what has here been called revisionist naturalism, in that\nit advocates getting rid of the disease concept altogether, rather\nthan just liberating it from commonsense constraints. Hybrid accounts\nhave been very popular among naturalists since at least the\ndissemination of Wakefield\u2019s (1992) influential discussion of mental\ndisorder \n\nThe second stage, the question about whether life is worsened by a\nmalfunction, is omitted by simple naturalism. Simple naturalists say\nthat all there is to disease is the failure of someone\u2019s physiology\n(or psychology) to work normally. The view has fewer adherents, but as\nnoted above, Szasz (1987) uses simple objectivism about disease to\njustify his claims that mental disorder is a myth, and Boorse has long\nadvocated such a view, as does Williams (2007). The popularity of\nhybrid accounts, though, is a problem for scholars like Glackin (2019,\np. 258), who argues that the debate exists between\n\u201cnormativists, who think the concept is inherently evaluative,\nand naturalists who think it is purely empirical\u201d. But it is\npossible to think that there is an empirical question about the causal\nbasis of disease and a further normative question about the judgments\nmade on that basis, which hybrid theorists also think are necessary\nfor disease. \n",
