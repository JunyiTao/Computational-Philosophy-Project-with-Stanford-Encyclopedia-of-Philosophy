    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric || Can Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric Be Misused?\n4.3 Can Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric Be Misused?\n\nPossessing the art of rhetoric is useful then even for those whose\nsole intent is to defend what they take to be true and just. Still,\ncan\u2019t the same art of rhetoric be misused, e.g. when practised\nby people with malicious intentions? The short answer is: Yes, of\ncourse. Rhetoric in general and even Aristotle\u2019s dialectic-based\nrhetoric can be misused depending on what people use it for what\npurposes. (And Aristotle himself is actually aware of the fact that\ndemagogues of his time use a certain style of rhetoric for\noverthrowing the democratic order: Politics V.5,\n1304b21\u20131305a15). The more elaborate answer that he gives is\nthis. The art of rhetoric (if based on dialectic: see above\n \u00a7 3)\n is useful partly because it facilitates persuasive argument for the\nopposites, i.e. on either side of a question. This is first of all\nseen as an advantage in competence, for people who have full command\nof this art won\u2019t miss any persuasive aspect of a given\nquestion, and this is also seen as a practical advantage, for it helps\nto detect what goes wrong in the opponent\u2019s arguments\n(1355a29\u201338), especially if those opponents use it for\nobjectionable purposes. That this peculiar feature of dialectic-based\nrhetoric opens the door for misuse is true, but this cannot be held\nagainst the art of rhetoric, since the same ambivalence (that\nsomething can be used for the better or for the worse) applies to most\ngoods (e.g. wealth, beauty \u2014 the only non-ambivalent good is, on\nAristotle\u2019s view, virtue). Also, Aristotle downplays the risk of\nmisuse by stressing that it is easier to convince someone of the just\nand good than of their opposites (especially when using the\nAristotelian style of rhetoric).\n\nStill, for many interpreters of Aristotle, from the times of the great\nRoman rhetoricians on, it is hard to embrace the thought that\nAristotle \u2014 the famous author of the Nicomachean Ethics\nand the Politics \u2014 who in his ethical work praises the\nlife in accordance with human virtue, could ever endorse a rhetorical\nproject that is not meant to promote virtue and happiness in the\ncity-state (polis). Is it, in other words, possible or likely\nthat Aristotle, whose name in the history of moral philosophy stands\nfor an ethics based on the sustainable development of moral virtues,\nendorses a technique of rhetoric that does not serve the purpose of\npromoting virtuous goals? This is a legitimate worry. It can be\naddressed by distinguishing internal from external ends of rhetoric\n(which is, to be sure, not Aristotle\u2019s distinction; however, he\nuses a similar distinction between a thing\u2019s proper function,\ncorresponding to the internal end, and the question what something is\nuseful for, corresponding to the external end). The internal end, i.e.\nthe function that defines the art of rhetoric, is to consider what is\npersuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1),\n and since there might be persuasive aspects on both sides of a\nquestion, the art of rhetoric as such \u2014 i.e. according to its\ninternal end \u2014 is neutral with regard to true and false, just\nand unjust, noble and wicked points of view. It can be equally used\nfor promoting good or bad positions (even though, as Aristotle says,\nit is easier to promote the good ones). All this follows from the\ndialectical character of Aristotle\u2019s art of rhetoric (see above\n \u00a7 3).\n If we are interested, by contrast, in the external ends of rhetoric,\ni.e. the question of what it is useful for (see above\n \u00a7 4.2)\n or the question of how Aristotle himself wants this art to be used,\nthen it is easy to contrive a plausible story either based on\nAristotle\u2019s ethico-political writings or on hints given in the\nRhetoric itself (see e.g. Dow 2015, 64\u201375, for such an\nattempt) about the morally desirable uses of a style of rhetoric that\nis based on arguments (sanctioning convicted offenders, defending\ninnocent culprits, averting political decisions that are likely to do\nharm to the city-state, voicing the point of view of the decent\ncitizens, defending the rule of law, standing up to insurrectionists\nand demagogues, etc.).\n",
