    "preamble": "\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg (1871\u20131919), described by one of\nher colleagues as the \u201cmost brilliant intellect of all the\nscientific heirs of Marx and Engels\u201d (Fr\u00f6hlich 1940/2010:\n153 citing Franz Mehring in Neue Zeit) is one of the most\noriginal and influential thinkers in the history of Marxism. Her life\nand works stand out for the unique combination of intellectual rigour\nand political integrity, a rare ability to merge deep theoretical\ninsight with sharp political vision, the development of knowledge which\nis at the same time militant activism.\n\n\nLuxemburg is best known for her contributions to\nsome of the most important economic and political debates that have\nshaped the development of socialist thought: the critique of capitalism\nand the dynamics of capital accumulation, the development of\nglobalisation and its relation to colonialism and imperialism, the\nlimits of national self-determination, the relationship of revolution\nto democracy, the challenges of parliamentary reform, the role of\nstrikes and trade unions in political organisation, political parties,\nthe critique of liberal feminism, the analysis of racism in connection\nto capitalist exploitation. She defended freedom, understood as a form\nof individual and collective self-rule, which could only be fully\nrealised in a democratic socialist society, and gave her life for the\ncause. She was uncompromising in both her critique of capitalism and of\nbureaucratic authoritarian socialism. For this reason, and in part also\ndue to her tragic death, her legacy has been appropriated (and\ndistorted) by both Western Marxists keen to chart an alternative path\nto state socialism, and socialist states attracted to her theory of\ncapitalist crisis and her radical critique of social-democracy. In the\ncontext of an ongoing electoral decline of traditional\nsocial-democratic parties, and with the rise of far-right challenges to\ncrisis-ridden liberal political institutions, Luxemburg\u2019s work\nhas enjoyed a significant revival. It remains an important source of\ncritique of the global political economy, one of the most sophisticated\nattempts to think about democracy and revolution, and an ongoing source\nof inspiration to reflect on the meaning of socialist emancipation\nbeyond national boundaries.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg was born on March 5 1871 in Zamo\u015b\u0107, a\npredominantly Jewish centre in south-eastern Poland, then occupied by\nTzarist Russia. She was the youngest of five children in a progressive\nfamily of assimilated Jews who were timber merchants. Her father,\nEliasz (Eduard) Luxemburg, like her elder brothers, was educated in\nGermany. Her mother, Line, nee L\u00f6wenstein, was a well-read and\nhighly articulate woman with a passion for classical literature,\nespecially German and Polish, which she tried to inculcate on her\nchildren. Two years after Luxemburg\u2019s birth, in 1873, the family\nmoved to Warsaw. At the age of three, Luxemburg contracted a hip\ndisease which was wrongly treated as tuberculosis, and caused her to\nwalk with a limp for the rest of her life. She was bedbound for a\nyear, a period during which she taught herself to read and write.\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Luxemburg joined the\ngirls\u2019 Second High School in Warsaw, one of the country\u2019s\nelite schools, dominated by the children of Russian officials, where\nthe use of Polish even among students was forbidden and the places for\nchildren of Jewish families were extremely limited. Luxemburg rebelled\nto the oppressive atmosphere in the school, and developed an interest\nin the activities of the various illegal revolutionary groups agitating\nagainst both capitalist oppression and the despotic character of\nRussian rule. By the time she finished secondary school in 1887, her\n\u201crebellious attitude towards authorities\u201d was already\nmentioned in official school reports and deprived her of the gold medal\nawarded to the highest performing students (Nettl 1966 [2019: 17]). It is\nalso likely that during this time, she joined what was left of\nProletariat, the first Polish socialist party, at that point\nin disarray after the imprisonment and execution of many of its\nleaders as a result of the repressive measures taken by Russian\nauthorities following the assassination of Tzar Alexander II in\n1881. Faced with imminent arrest herself, she was smuggled out of the\ncountry in 1889 and migrated to Zurich. There she enrolled in the\nfaculty of philosophy, switched to law and wrote a doctoral\ndissertation on \u201cThe Industrial Development of Poland\u201d,\nwhere she argued that the integration of the Polish economy into the\nRussian empire meant that the interests of the Polish working class\nwould be held back by championing the cause of national\nself-determination \u2013 a position to which she would remain\ncommitted her entire life. In Zurich, Luxemburg also met several other\nMarxists from Russian and Polish emigres circles, including Leo\nJogisches, her partner for many years and co-founder of the Social\nDemocracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP), a Marxist party\ncharacterised by its opposition to the call for Polish independence\nand its staunch commitment to proletarian internationalism.\n\n\nThe Swiss years were characterised by a mix of\nacademic and political work. Luxemburg, just over twenty, was\nentangled in a fight against the main Polish Socialist Party (PSP) by\nthen fully committed to a mixture of progressive nationalism and\nMarxism, and for the recognition of the SDKP by the Socialist\nInternational. She conducted the struggle both on the political stage\nand in the main organs of international social democracy such as\nVorw\u00e4rts and Neue Zeit, as well as in the\npolitical magazine she and Jogisches edited, Sprawa Robotnica\n(Workers\u2019 Cause). All this meant that when she moved to Germany\nin 1898 with the help of a fictitious marriage to the son of one of her\nfriends, a German national, she was already well known to the\nleadership of the largest social democratic party in the world, the\nSozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD). She rose quickly through\nthe ranks of the SPD, in no small part due to her sharply critical\ninterventions in the \u201crevisionist\u201d controversy which shook\nthe party to its core in the years of transition from the\n19th to the 20th century.\n\n\nIn 1905, the first Russian revolution broke up, the \u201cdress\nrehearsal\u201d for the subsequent Bolshevik revolution of 1917, in\nLenin\u2019s famous sentence. It found the socialist movement deeply\ndivided. In the West, socialist parties made steady electoral gains,\nand united superficially in recognition of the moral authority of the\nSecond International but were deeply divided in matters of both\nprinciple and tactics. In Russia, there was no direct equivalent to\nthe debate on reform versus revolution: socialists worked underground\nand were divided mainly on questions of membership and party\norganisation. The 1905 revolution which broke out after decades of\nimpoverishment, a series of defeats by Russia in the Russo-Japanese\nwar, and subjection to authoritarian violence was not so much a single\nevent as the cumulative result of several years of mass strikes,\nborder unrest, and demonstrations which forced Marxists to put the\nquestion of party organisation at the centre of their\ndebates. Luxemburg, recently released from a few months in prison in\nZwickau on a charge of undermining the authority of the German\nemperor, followed the events closely. She published several\ninterventions in which she debated with Lenin on the role of the\nmasses and the party in revolutionary circumstances, and tried to\npersuade her colleagues in the SPD to adopt the mass strike as a\npolitical weapon to advance the cause of workers also in Germany. In\nDecember 1905 she smuggled herself on a military train to the Russian\npart of Poland, and tried to reach Warsaw, where martial law coexisted\nwith a general strike, to resume her work of agitation with the Polish\nworking classes. Within a year she was arrested again, first confined\nto a police prison in the Warsaw town hall then transferred on grounds\nof ill-health to the Warsaw Citadel.  There she spent a few months\nuntil her release following both her family\u2019s intercessions and\npayment of the bail, and her reputation as one of the leading\nactivists of the German SPD.  Immediately after her release from\nprison she went to St Petersburg then Finland, where she met Lenin and\nwrote one of her most famous pamphlets: \u201cThe Mass Strike, the\nParty and the Trade Unions\u201d, reflecting on the lessons of the\n1905 revolution.  The story goes that when she proposed these ideas to\nthe SPD Party Congress of Jena in 1905, August Bebel, one of the party\nfounders, joked that \u2013 as he listened to a debate with so much\nblood and revolution \u2013 he kept \u201cglancing occasionally at\nmy boots to see if these weren\u2019t in fact already wading in\nblood\u201d (Nettl 1966 [2019: 310]).\n\n\nUpon her return to Germany, in 1907, \u201cbloody\nRosa\u201d as she became known to the liberal press was engaged as a\nteacher in the Party School, where she taught \u201cIntroduction to\nEconomics\u201d and \u201cMarx\u2019s Capital\u201d to rank and\nfile members of the SPD. Her \u201cIntroduction to Economics\u201d\nbased on lecture notes survives only in fragments but \u201cThe\nAccumulation of Capital\u201d, published in 1913, is one of the most\nimportant works of theory to have emerged from the Second\nInternational. At the same time, her political stance continued to\nevolve in a direction opposite to the SPD leadership, whose growing\nreluctance to condemn the imperialist ventures of Kaiser Wilhelm II in\nMorocco made her vividly aware both of the dangers of stirring\nnationalist sentiments to increase support for a possible war, and of\nthe evasive attitudes of her colleagues toward rising militarism. She\nfelt increasingly isolated. While the parliamentary party became\nentangled in debates around taxation and suffrage reform, she wrote to\nadvocate the importance of mass struggles, the agitation for a\ndemocratic republic and the conquest of political power by the\nproletariat. Her proposals were met with hostility even from erstwhile\nallies like Karl Kautsky, and the main party publications refused to\npublish her work.\n\n\nThe break came in 1914 when WW1 erupted and the\nSPD voted in favour of war credits, de facto embracing crude\nnationalism at the expense of the internationalist promise of concern\nfor the whole working class regardless of national boundaries. Workers\nonce united against capitalists would now kill each other at the border\nunder different flags. Together with Franz Mehring, Klara Zetkin, and\nKarl Liebknecht, the only SPD deputy in the Reichstag to have opposed\nwar credits until the end, Luxemburg founded the Spartakus\ngroup \u2013 initially part of the USPD (Unabh\u00e4ngige\nSozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) the anti-war splinter\nfaction from the SPD \u2013 and which was also known as the International\ngroup after Die Internationale, the joint publication which\nagitated for an end to the war and developing working class struggle\nagainst capitalism on an international basis. Soon after, Luxemburg was\nimprisoned, released, and then imprisoned again. Behind bars, she wrote\n\u201cThe Crisis of Social Democracy\u201d better known as the Junius\npamphlet or Juniusbroch\u00fcre because of the pseudonym\nJunius under which it appeared. It was the synthesis of a life\u2019s\ncritique of the limits of liberal parliamentarism, the pursuit of\ncompromise for compromise\u2019s sake, and the consequences of a\nfailure to commit to principled internationalism on the side of social\ndemocratic parties which were organised on a national basis.\n\n\nWhen Luxemburg was released from prison in November 1918, Germany\nlooked very different. The success of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917\nwhich led to the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and\nRussia sparked mutiny at the border and a series of strikes and\ninsurrections among the German workers who demanded a democratic\nrepublic. From prison, Luxemburg had greeted the Russian revolution as\n\u201can act of world-historical significance whose traces will be\nnot be extinguished for aeons\u201d (cited in Fr\u00f6hlich 1940\n[2010: 239]). But as her verdict makes clear, she was not hopeful that\nthe victory would last, in no small part because she lacked confidence\nthat German social democrats would support their Russian\ncounterparts. While the Spartakus group continued to demand\nthe creation of a socialist republic based on workers\u2019 councils,\nthe SPD greeted the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II by installing its\nleader, Friedrich Ebert as chancellor of the new liberal\nparliamentarian republic. From Berlin, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl\nLiebknecht published the first issue of Rote Fahne, the organ\nof the Spartakusbund, followed in December by the\nannouncement of the programme. The contrast between alternatives could\nnot have been starker: either the \u201ctraditional organs of\nbourgeois class rule, the federal councils, the parliaments, municipal\ncouncils etc.\u201d or the proletariat\u2019s own \u201cclass\norgans: Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Councils\u201d in which\nthey \u201coccupy all public posts, superintend all public activity,\nand measure all the needs of the state by their own class interests\nand socialists tasks\u201d (cited in Fr\u00f6hlich 1940 [2010: 273]). A\ncouple of weeks later the same programme was presented in the\ninaugural Congress of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) where\nLuxemburg argued in favour of participating in the upcoming January\nelections to the National Assembly. She was outvoted. In the first\ndays of January 1919, another wave of protests saw hundreds of\nthousands of workers descend into the streets and occupy train\nstations and newspapers. The Spartakists urged caution. Despite the\nanarchy in Berlin, Luxemburg, especially, did not think the German\npeople were ready for a socialist revolution. The Spartakist uprising\nmobilised the far right, while, Gustav Noske, the social-democratic\nInterior minister ordered the police to crush the protests. With the\nhelp of the Freikorps, the far-right, anti-republican, proto-nazi\nparamilitary groups, many activists were arrested and murdered. The\nsame fate would soon fall on Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. On\nthe 15th January 1919, they were discovered in their hiding\nplace, arrested, knocked unconscious with rifle buts then\nshot. Luxemburg\u2019s body was thrown into Berlin\u2019s Landwehr\nCanal, from where it washed ashore a few months after.\n2. Social reform or revolution\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg established herself as a major\nintellectual figure in Marxist circles with her intervention in the\nrevisionist controversy, the theoretical and political debate around\nthe principles and aims of social-democracy that divided the Second\nInternational at the turn of the 19th century. The debate\nwas sparked by Eduard Bernstein, Friedrich Engels\u2019s close friend,\ncollaborator and literary executor, as well as a senior figure in the\nGerman Social Democratic Party. It unfolded first in a series of\narticles published between 1896 and 1898 in Die Neue Zeit,\nthen subsequently consolidated in a volume entitled The\nPreconditions of Socialism (1899). As the Prussian government\nprogressively relaxed the Anti-Socialist laws promoted by the then\nchancellor Otto von Bismarck, and social democratic ranks continued to\nswell, Bernstein tried to revisit some of the core theoretical and\npolitical commitments of Marxism by offering a new analysis of the\ntransformation of capitalism in the fifty years following the\npublication of Marx and Engels\u2019s Communist Manifesto. He\ncriticised one of the fundamental pillars of Marxian economics: that\nthe historical tendency of the rate of profit to fall under the twin\npressure of technological modernisation and an increasingly exploited\nlabour force rendered inevitable the crisis of the system. This,\nBernstein argued, required social-democrats to abandon their\nrevolutionary aims in favour of enacting progressive legislation which\nsought to represent workers through parliamentary struggle. He insisted\nthat this was no subversion of the teachings of the founding fathers,\nbut rather an effort to liberate Marxism from the dialectical\nstraightjacket in which many socialists of the Second International had\nsubsequently placed it.\n\n\nThe debate centred around the question of whether\ndemocracy and capitalism were compatible. The starting point for\nBernstein\u2019s critique was the Marxist claim that capitalism was a\nsocial system with a tendency to collapse under the pressure of its own\ncontradictions. In the pages of Capital, Marx had written\neloquently about how capitalist economies faced the prospect of ever\nmore destructive crises due to the twin pressures of technological\nmodernisation and the tendency of the rate of profits to fall. At the\ntime of Bernstein\u2019s contribution, this methodological commitment\nto understanding capital as a system with an inherent propensity\ntowards crisis was widely shared among the main theorists of the Second\nInternational. To suggest that the argument was false was to strike at\nthe core of Marxist political economy. But what made the attack\nparticularly uncomfortable, and difficult to dismiss, was that\nBernstein presented his argument not as a break with Marxist\nmethodological assumptions but as an internal development of its\nnormative and empirical requirements. He began by insisting that\ndialectics was nothing other than the methodological commitment to\nmatch one\u2019s theory to new developments in practice. The history\nof capitalist development in the 19th century showed not a\ncumulative series of ever sharper failures but a resilient system with\na surprising capacity for adaptation. From an economic perspective\nthere were a number of new developments with which the Marxist analysis\nhad to reckon: the intensification of foreign trade, the expansion of\nthe banking and financial sector, the development of the credit system,\nand the emergence of cartels and trusts. From a political perspective,\nthe consolidation of middle classes, the rise of property owners, and\nthe expansion of the franchise meant that liberal representation could\nno longer be identified with the perpetuation of oppression by ruling\nelites. There was now reasonable hope that the gap between the private\nand the public sphere, between the ethos of the bourgeois and\nthat of the citoyen could be bridged. On the one hand, the\nextension of the right to vote to previously disenfranchised categories\nof people; on the other hand the strengthening of workers\u2019 unions\nand cooperatives as well as the prospects of electoral successes for\nmass social-democratic parties across Western Europe made it hard to\nequate representative democracy with the consolidation of class rule.\n Citizenship emerged as the new concept through which capital\ncould be put to the service of the democratic state. Representative\ndemocracy and political emancipation were part of the same project, a\nproject that social-democrats could develop regardless of\n\u201cthe final goal.\u201d\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg was not the only one to protest against\nBernstein\u2019s reinterpretation of Marxism. His position was\ndiscussed (and rejected) at the Stuttgart Conference of the German\nSocial Democratic party (1898) where more established members of the\nSPD, including Karl Kautsky and August Bebel, also spoke against his\nthesis. Luxemburg\u2019s intervention, which appeared partially in\narticle form in Leipziger Volkszeitung, and was subsequently\npublished in 1900 under the title Social Reform or Revolution\n(second edition 1908) was, however, a point-by-point response. Her\ncritique targeted Bernstein\u2019s arguments as synthesised in the\nfamous (or infamous) dictum: \u201cthe final goal is nothing to me,\nthe movement is everything.\u201d\n\n\nThis, Luxemburg explained, was a false dilemma.  \u201cCan\nSocial-Democracy be against reforms? Can we contrapose the social\nrevolution, the transformation of the existing order, our final goal,\nto social reforms? Certainly not.\u201d At the heart of\nBernstein\u2019s dilemma, she suggested, was not a tactical choice, a\nsimple discussion about this or that method of struggle; it was the\n\u201cvery existence of the Social Democratic movement\u201d as a\ndistinctive force in the struggle against capitalism (Luxemburg\n1900 [RLR: 129]).\n\n\nBut just like Bernstein\u2019s arguments were\ngrounded in apparently Marxist theory so was Luxemburg\u2019s\nresponse. She was committed to the idea that socialism is a\n\u201chistoric necessity\u201d, a theory whose desirability is\ndictated by the correct interpretation of empirical circumstances.\n\u201cEither revisionism is correct concerning the course of\ncapitalist development, and therefore socialism becomes a\nutopia\u201d, she wrote, or \u201csocialism is not a utopia; and\ntherefore the theory of the means of adaptation is false\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 134]).\n\n\nTo illustrate the latter, her analysis combined\neconomic and political arguments and focused on the structure of\nglobalization and the role of nation-states in a financialized economic\nsystem. The conclusions reached however were opposite to those of\nBernstein. While Bernstein had interpreted the development of the\ncredit and debit system as stabilising mechanisms within a capitalist\norder, for Luxemburg the concentration of economic power by monopoly\nholders, corporations, banks and other financial institutions were\nsymptoms of vulnerability rather than an asset. In response to\nBernstein\u2019s remarks on the role of credit in avoiding capitalist\ncollapse, she emphasized that financial capitalism and the availability\nof loans aggravates crisis rather than providing a solution to it.\nCredit, Luxemburg argued, encourages speculation and widens the gap\nbetween what might be called the real and the fictitious economy.\nIndeed, while credit initially stimulates the development of productive\nforces, it can also lead to errors of calculation and overproduction,\ntherefore ceasing to be helpful in the exchange process at the first\nsymptom of stagnation. Likewise, cartels and trusts, and the other\nregulatory mechanisms designed to increase coordination among the\nholders of capital can only succeed by eliminating internal competition\nin isolated industries, something that cannot be extended to all\nsectors of production. Moreover, cartels succeed at increasing the rate\nof profit in internal markets only in virtue of expansion outwards, by\nselling abroad the products that cannot be absorbed by domestic demand.\nIn other words, Luxemburg explained, these companies are only able to\nsell abroad, at lower rates of profit, the product that cannot be\nabsorbed by domestic markets. The other face of apparent market\nstability in Europe is sharpened competition abroad and anarchy on the\nworld market \u2013 the opposite of what cartels intended to achieve. When\nthe global market begins to shrink because it has been exhausted by\ncompetition between capitalist countries, the capital that has been\nsocialised through organisation reverts to private capital and\nemployers organisations \u201cburst like soap bubbles and give way to\nfree competition in aggravated form\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR:\n137]). \n\n\nFrom a political perspective, Luxemburg maintained, work for reforms\nshould not be understood as \u201ca drawn-out revolution,\u201d and\nrevolution should not be understood as \u201ca condensed series of\nreforms.\u201d Historically, legal reform, she explaned, has served\nthe purpose of consolidating an emerging social class until the\nbalance of political forces is such that the existing juridical\nrelations can be eventually dismantled in favor of new ones. Every\nlegal order, she maintained, emerges out of a social and political\nrevolution: \u201crevolution is the act of political creation while\nlegislation is the political expression of a society that has already\ncome into being\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 156]). This is precisely\nwhat the terms \u201creform\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d mean:\nthey suggest a radical change in the content of fundamental legal\ndispositions rather than in the manner of their realization. Legal\nreform and revolution are not different methods of historical progress\nthat \u201ccan be picked out from the counter of history as one picks\nout hot or cold sausages\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 156]). Those who\noppose the method of legal reform to the goal of conquering political\npower by the workers do not oppose \u201ca more tranquil, calmer and\nslower method to the same goal\u201d; they choose \u201ca different\ngoal\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 157]). They choose to operate within\nthe legal framework dictated by the old order instead of committing to\nestablish a new one. The political analysis of revisionism produces a\nsimilar outcome to its economic analysis: it abandons the commitment\nto socialism in favour of the preservation of capitalism, and tries to\nreduce abuses in the system rather than eliminating the system itself.\nTo achieve the more radical outcome, it is essential for the\nproletariat to have access to political power. The fate of democracy,\nLuxemburg insisted, is \u201cbound up with the fate of the labour\nmovement\u201d. While the advocacy of reforms via parliamentary and\ntrade union mechanisms would prepare the working classes for the\nexercise of political power, the fact that these demands were\ninscribed in a liberal institutional framework made it impossible to\novercome capitalism from within. The reformist method ended up pitting\nsocialism against democracy without understanding the nature of legal\nrevolutions. In turning the dispute from one of content of legal\ndispositions to one of style of execution, it ended up losing sight of\nboth.\n3. Critique of political economy\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s political stance is grounded in\nher analysis of capital as a set of economic, political and social\nrelations with global scope. She developed her contribution to Marxist\npolitical economy in The Accumulation of Capital: A\nContribution to the Economic Explanation of\nImperialism (1913) and in her Introduction to Political\nEconomy published posthumously in 1925 and based on her lectures\non the same subject at the SPD party school. Her starting position is\nthat the core of a capitalist economy is the extraction of surplus\nvalue and the exploitation of workers as a source of accumulation of\nprofits. As Luxemburg puts it, the distinctive feature of a capitalist\nsystem of production consists in the fact that \u201conly those goods\nare produced which can with certainty be expected to sell, and not\nmerely to sell, but to sell at the customary profit\u201d (Luxemburg\n1913 [AK: 35]). To understand how this is possible, she argues, we need\nto focus on total capital and its continuous transformation\nfrom commodity to money and back to commodity again, in a new cycle of\nspiralling profits (Bellofiore 2009). What is required to maintain the\ncapitalist system, Luxemburg shows, is firstly the ability of\ncapitalists to make profit guaranteed by the reproduction of capitalism\nas a system; secondly, enough demand to meet the offer of new\ncapitalist commodities brought into the market; and thirdly an\nincentive to accumulate based on the prospect of new markets to absorb\nincreasing production.\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s study of the dynamic structure of capital\naccumulation begins with a critique of Volume II of Capital.  More\nspecifically, it starts with Marx\u2019s analysis of capitalism as a\n\u201cclosed system\u201d based on a simplified model of relations\nof production between capitalists and workers, which abstracts from\nthe existence of non-capitalist economies. As Marx had put it in\nchapter 24 of Capital, \u201cwe must treat the whole world\nof trade as one nation, and assume that capitalist production is\nestablished everywhere and has taken possession of every branch of\nindustry\u201d (Marx 1887 [1990: 727]). The problem with this\nanalysis, Luxemburg pointed out, consists in a mistaken understanding\nof capital accumulation as a mere question of \u201cthe sources of\nmoney when the real issue is the effective demand, the use made of\ngoods, not the source of money which is paid for them\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1913 [AK: 128]). The closed-system analysis, she\nsuggested, made it difficult to explain how capital could be\nreproduced and valorized in a capitalist society based only on the\nexploitation of workers, and related extraction of surplus value.\n\n\nTo better explain this point it is important to emphasise that one of\nthe core ideas in Marx\u2019s analysis of accumulation was the\nexplanation of the reproduction of capital with reference to the\ndevelopment of technology, competition among capitalists, and their\nthirst for maximizing profit. Luxemburg found that this analysis did\nnot do justice to the distinctive structural constraints of capital\nreproduction. In particular, it did not take account of the necessity\nto access new markets in order to sell consumption goods that\nimpoverished domestic workers could no longer afford. Without the\nguarantee of an ever-expanding market, in a depressed economy with low\ndemand for consumption goods there would be no possibility of capital\nreinvestment and no outlet for accumulated capital stocks. More\nspecifically, under conditions of pauperisation, inequality, and\nongoing exploitation of workers by capitalists, the workers would not\nbe able to generate the demand necessary to absorb the commodities\nproduced by capitalists. The capitalists\u2019 own patterns of\nconsumption would not help to solve the problem of underconsumption\nsince the capitalist class is driven by the imperative to accumulate\ncapital and reinvest in order to keep up with the pressures of market\ncompetition, production, technological modernisation and so on. Given\nthe tension between \u201cthe unlimited expansive capacity of the\nproductive forces\u201d and \u201cthe limited expansive capacity of\nsocial consumption\u201d highlighted in volume 3 of Capital,\nMarx\u2019s own analysis could not explain how the consumption\nnecessary to increase profits could give rise to an\n\u201cenlarged\u201d rather than \u201csimple\u201d reproduction\nof capital. The decisive fact, Luxemburg argued, is that surplus value\n\u201ccannot be realised by sale either to workers or to capitalists,\nbut only if it is sold to such social organisations or strata whose\nown mode of production is not capitalistic\u201d.\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s core insight is that the expansion of capital in\nnoncapitalist areas of the world by way of conquest, trade, violence\nor deception provides the kind of outlet that capital needs in order\nto be reproduced as a system. Cheap mass-produced goods that struggle\nto be sold in the markets of developed capitalist states because of\nlow patterns of consumption become available in other areas of the\nworld. They create investment opportunities that displace traditional\nways of organizing economic life, and destroy predominantly\nagricultural forms of production. They also bring in technological\ninnovations and modernizing projects that modify existing relations of\nauthority and reshape forms of class conflict different from the\ncapitalist one. Moreover, thanks to its expansion to non-capitalist\nareas and the disruption of traditional ways of life, there is also\nincreased migration and the possibility of recruiting cheap labour\nforce caused by the disintegration of primitive forms of production\nand non-capitalist ways of life. As Luxemburg pointed out,\n\u201csince capitalist production can develop fully only with\ncomplete access to all territories and climes, it can no more confine\nitself to the natural resources and productive forces of the temperate\nzone than it can manage with white labour alone.  Capital needs other\nraces to exploit territories where the white man cannot work. It must\nbe able to mobilise world labour power without restriction in order to\nutilise all productive forces of the globe\u201d (Luxemburg 1913\n[AK: 343]).\n\n\nSuch an analysis of racism as an integral component of capitalist\nexploitation helped her see the oppression of non-white peoples as an\nongoing feature of the structural replication of the capitalist\nsystem. While Marx had examined colonialism, migration and the\ndisruption of non-capitalist economies with reference only to the\ngenesis of capital (the problem of so-called primitive accumulation),\nLuxemburg criticised him for failing to see how capitalism, also in\nits \u201cfull maturity\u201d depends on non-capitalist strata and\nsocial organisations existing side by side.  Capital, Luxemburg,\nargues, constantly \u201cneeds the means of production and the labour\npower of the whole globe for untrammelled accumulation\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1913 [AK: 346]).\n\n\nThis analysis leads to an understanding of imperialism as the\npolitical expression of competition among capitalists for \u201cwhat\nremains still open of the non-capitalist environment\u201d (Luxemburg\n1913 [AK: 465]). Differently from the expectation of classical\neconomists that the development of commercial relations would bring\npeace among nations, Luxemburg showed how \u201cthe harmony of\ninterests between commercial nations in the East were proclaimed to\nthe sound of gunfire in the Opium Wars\u201d (Luxemburg 1913 [AK:\n427]). And while imperial conquest, displacement and war guarantee the\ndirect subjection of whole parts of the world to the political control\nof more developed capitalist countries, other subtle ways of control\n\u2013 for example, in the form of international loans \u2013 create\npolitical and economic dependency that places the foreign and economic\npolicy of young capitalist states directly under the influence of\ntheir neocolonial masters.  International loans, as she explained,\nhelp dependent territories acquire the resources needed to modernise\nand develop their infrastructure while also financing the export of\ncapital from advanced capitalist countries. However, in a\nfinancialized economy, with investment comes speculation, and when\nhopes of increasing rates of profit are disappointed, debt comes to\nhaunt these vulnerable national economies and losses need to be\nsocialized. This triggers a new, even deeper, crisis and the beginning\nof a new cycle of accumulation accompanied by militarism as a weapon\nin the competitive struggle among nations (Toporowski 2015).\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s reading of Marx as well as her analysis of the\naccumulation of capital has attracted several criticisms. It became a\nmatter of controversy already during the Second International when\nauthors such as Bukharin and Lenin, inspired by the Austrian social\ndemocratic economist Rudolph Hilferding\u2019s analysis of finance\ncapital, pointed out the flaws in Luxemburg\u2019s reading of Marx,\nand criticised her for holding a \u201cteleological\u201d view of\ncapitalism in which the whole system is acsribed a purpose much like\nthe component parts of it. This, they further argued, leads to a\nmistaken view of the accumulation of capital (see for a discussion\nBrewer 1990: 62\u201364 and Callinicos 2001: 36\u201342).  As a matter of\nMarxist exegesis, several scholars have also emphasised, that if one\nintegrates the analysis of Capital with Marx\u2019s other\nwritings on colonialism, it is possible to show how\nCapital volume 1 already anticipated a number of critiques\nmade by theorists of the Second International and could be productively\ndeployed to generate a critique of imperalism not too dissimilar from\nLuxemburg\u2019s (Pradella 2013). Moreover, so defenders of Marx point\nout, Luxemburg\u2019s critique is methodologically flawed. While Marx\nintended his scheme of reproduction to be an abstract analysis which\nbrackets away from historical constraints to illustrate the inner\ncontraddictions in the continuous search for profit, Luxemburg\nconflates this philosophical abstraction with a description of\nhistorical reality. Finally , several prominent Marxist economists\n(e.g., Sweezy 1967) criticised her for focusing on the seemingly\nunorthodox premise that \u201cconsumption\u201d rather than the\nrealisation of surplus value is the main concern of a capitalist sytem\nthus conflating the question of \u201cwhere does demand come from to\nto realise surplus value\u201d with the question \u201cwhere does the\nmoney come from to monetise profits\u201d (see Bellofiore 2009 for a\ndiscussion and response).\n\n\nNotwithstanding these criticisms, the originality of Luxemburg\u2019s\ncontribution to an analysis of the role of finance in the accumulation\nof capital, and her emphasis on the monetary character of the\ncapitalist economy cannot be denied. She was one of the first authors\nto contribute to what some have called the \u201ccritical school of\nfinance\u201d which pioneered an analysis of financial crisis as\nrelatively independent from industrial crisis, anticipating later\ndebates on the relation between the rate of savings and the motivation\nto invest as discussed in the works of John Maynard Keynes, Michal\nKalecki and Hyman Minsky (Robinson 2013). Her remarks on the role of\nthe credit and debit system are crucial to understand the\nunderdevelopment and ongoing reproduction of relations of dependency\nbetween core and peripheral capitalist countries. Luxemburg\u2019s\nanalysis of the constant expansion of capital into non-capitalist\neconomies is still crucial to understand contemporary globalisation\npractices, the interconnectedness between global financial crisis and\nthe pressures of international migration, and to explain how global\ndispossession and exploitation work together to advance the interests\nof a global capitalist class.\n4. Anti-imperialism and national self-determination\n\n\nThe focus on the development of noncapitalist areas of the world gave\nLuxemburg a sensitivity to questions of race, ethnicity, and\nindigenous rights that was uncharacteristic for the Marxism of her\ntime. Up to that point, several Marxists had more or less shared the\nteleological scheme defended by many Enlightenment philosophers that\ncharacterised the process of societal evolution as a transition\nthrough different stages of development. Starting with nomadic\n(hunter-gathering) forms of life, who were then supplanted by pastoral\nthen agricultural relations, these conjectural histories usually\nculminated with commercial societies, often considered to be a\nsuperior form of social organisation. Luxemburg was one of the\npioneers of a study of racism and cultural appropriation as\ndistinctive yet integrated components of an analysis of capitalism\nwhere exploitation and racial subordination are mutually\nreinforcing. \u201cThe progress of the humanistic era of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, she remarked sarcastically while commenting on\nGerman colonialism at the end of the 18th century, could be seen in\nhow the captain of a ship transporting slaves from Guinea to Guyana in\nSouth America, \u201cto alleviate their [the slaves] melancholy and\nto keep them from dying off, allowed them to dance on the ship\u2019s\ndeck with music and whip cracks every evening, something to which the\nmore brutal Spanish traders had not resorted\u201d (Luxemburg 1910\n[CW: 209]).\n\n\nIn the manuscript on the Introduction to the Critique of Political\nEconomy based on her lectures at the SPD school and published\npostuhumously, Luxemburg examined at length primitive communism in\nsocieties as diverse as Germanic tribes, the Inca empire, British\nIndia, French Algeria, and Russia. She illustrated how collective\nforms of land ownership had an extraordinary capacity for tenacity and\nadaptation to changing historical circumstances, showing enduring\nresilience towards despotism, foreign rule, outside conquest and\nexploitation. There was only one contact, Luxemburg pointed out, that\nthose societies could not withstand: \u201cthe contact with European\ncivilisation, i.e. with capitalism\u201d. This encounter, she wrote,\nis \u201cdeadly, universally and without exception and it\naccomplishes what centuries of the most savage Oriental conquerors\ncould not: the dissolution of the whole social structure from the\ninside, tearing apart all traditional bonds and transforming the\nsociety in a short period of time into a shapeless pile of\nrubble\u201d (Luxemburg 1910 [CW: 227]).\n\n\nIn The Accumulation of Capital, the examples \u2013 of\nBritish colonialism in India, the Opium Wars, French colonialism in\nAlgeria, the struggle between Black African peoples and Dutch Boers,\nthe exploitation of Native Americans \u2013 serve as a reminder of\nhow capitalism develops against a background of coercion and racial\nabuse. At a time in which the German Social Democratic party\ncelebrated its electoral expansion while hesitating to condemn the\ncontribution of Germany to the scramble for Africa, Luxemburg wrote\nseveral articles and pamphlets in which she called attention to the\ngenocide of the Nama and Herero people of Namibia, and criticised the\ncomplicity of Kautsky and the SPD leadership in failing to condemn the\nexpansion of the Kaiser\u2019s imperial projects in Morocco for fear\nof losing parliamentary seats. While remaining committed to the fight\nagainst racism in Europe, as her public pronouncements on the Dreyfus\naffair demonstrate, she continued to see the struggle against\nexclusion within her own state as inextricably linked to the\ncondemnation of the racial abuse perpetuated by imperialist powers\naround the world. Black people in Africa \u201cwith whose bodies the\nEuropeans play a game of catch, are just as near to me\u201d as the\n\u201csuffering of the Jews\u201d, she emphasised (Luxemburg 1917\n[RLR: 390]).\n\n\nThis attention to the global dynamic of capitalist expansion and the\nanalysis of imperialism as an integral part of the development of\ncapital are important to explain Luxemburg\u2019s distinctive stance\non one of the most important questions that concerned the Marxist\nmovement: the desirability of national self-determination. The mutual\ndependence between economic and political power in the presence of\nglobalization and the continous drive to exploit remote areas of the\nworld made Luxemburg a skeptic of theories of political emancipation\nthrough national self-determination.  Here she differed from the\nmainstream Marxist position on national self-determination (including\nVladimir Lenin\u2019s) who had argued in favour of national\nliberation movements when these helped advance socialist goals. For\nLuxemburg, national liberation movements ended up playing into the\nhands of domestic liberal ruling elites and weakening the\ninternational workers\u2019 movement. Taking as an example a question\ncloser to home \u2013 whether Poland ought to gain independence from\nimperial Russia \u2013 she drew on her knowledge and experience to\ndefend strict international proletarianism and suggested that it was\nagainst the interests of the Polish working classes to become a\nself-determining nation. Her argument was that national\nself-determination cannot serve an emancipatory purpose if it is\ndivorced from the international labour movement.  That labour movement\nhowever ought to take a transnational form and not limit itself to a\nformal request for national self-determination since, on the face of\ncapitalist development, the formal defence of sovereignty would simply\nlimit the struggle.\n\n\nAuthors who study Luxemburg\u2019s stance on national\nself-determination believe that her hostility to it stems from\naversion to nationalism. Her argument however was more sophisticated\n(see Brie and Sch\u00fctrumpf 2021). Luxemburg was enthusiastic about\nthe unique contribution of national culture through art or literary\nproducts to the understanding of the historical and social\nspecificities of different nations, as her commentaries on the work of\nPolish poet Adam Mickiewicz make clear (see for a discussion Scott\n2021). However, her appreciation of such distinctive linguistic and\ncultural contributions was always distinguished from the issue of\nnation-state sovereignty \u2013 a positiion which put her at odds\nwith mainstream progressive movements in Congress Poland. While the\ncharge of being a \u201cnational nihilist\u201d may be exaggerated,\nit is fair to say that Luxemburg\u2019s prominence in the Polish\nsocialist movement, imprinted on the SDKP a sectarian tendency which\nmany historians have subsequently criticised for undermining the\nPolish workers\u2019 movement with its distinctive nationalist\ncommitments (Blanc 2017). Luxemburg always maintained that if the\npolitical and economic power of the Polish proletariat were so weighty\nas to make national self-determination a viable alternative, then\nsurely the workers would also have enough power to rebel against\ncapital beyond national boundaries. Given the empirical circumstances\nof Poland, Luxemburg believed that national self-determination was a\ndangerous distraction from the imperative to work with the labour\nmovement to fight the Russian empire and turn it into a socialist\nstate. Without socialist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia,\nshe argued, independence would deepen the exploitation of Polish\nworkers. The demand for national self-determination ran the risk of\nplaying in the hands of liberal ruling elites, distracting Polish\nworkers and turning them from an entity dominated by Russian capital\nto one dominated by Polish capital. This attitude towards nationalism\nis also central to understand her stance against the war, leading to\nher definitive break with German social democracy whom she accused of\njoining forces with nationalist conservatives to support the war\nagainst Russia. As she explained in the 1915 Junius Pamphlet:\n\u201cSo long as capitalist states exist, i.e., so long as\nimperialistic world policies determine and regulate the inner and\nouter life of a nation, there can be no \u2018national\nself-determination\u2019 either in war or in peace\u201d (Luxemburg\n1915 [RLR: 325]).\n5. Political organisation\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s analysis on questions of strategy and political\norganisation was shaped by her reflections on the development of\ncapitalism, her emphasis on the global character of that development\nand her conviction that any discussion of the issue of political\norganisation had to be historically informed and sensitive to the\ninternal dynamic of the political movements of different countries.\nWhile historical materialism provided the methodological foundation,\nLuxemburg\u2019s more specific interventions on the questions of the\nday (reform vs. revolution, economic vs. political struggle,\nspontaneous vs. centralised forms of political organisation) were\nshaped by her analysis of two very different experiences of working\nclass organisation. In Western Europe, the demands of workers were\nincreasingly driven (and constrained) by representation in the\ninstitutions of liberal parliamentary democracy, their demands\npresented in the language of civic rights, their appeals taking the\nform of a call to collective democratic responsibilty. In Eastern\nEurope, where the struggle for worker\u2019s rights took place mostly\nunderground, political debate was constantly threatened by censorship,\nand mass actions were organised in secret and at great risk to\nactivists\u2019 lives. The debate was therefore very different.\nLuxemburg\u2019s essay on the The Mass Strike, the Political\nParty and the Trade Union, synthesises the lessons learned from\nthe Russian revolution of 1905 and reflects on them to better\nunderstand working class organisation as a whole.\n\n\nThe focus of the discussion were political and economic strikes as\nmethods in the struggle against capitalism. Such strikes, confined to\nparticular sectors of production or to particular towns, should not be\nunderstood in isolation from each other, Luxemburg argued. The mass\nstrike, she suggests, should not be seen as \u201ca crafty method\ndiscovered by subtle reasoning for the purpose of making the\nproletarian struggle more effective but, the method of\nmotion of the proletarian mass, the phenomenal form of the\nproletarian struggle in the revolution\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR:\n192]). While a strike may begin as a series of demands for, say,\nreduced working hours or improved pay, those demands for a fairer\ndistribution are inseparable from the question of workers\u2019\naccess to political power. As Luxemburg puts it, \u201cthe economic\nstruggle is the transmitter from one political centre to another; the\npolitical struggle is the periodic fertilization of the soil for the\neconomic struggle\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR: 195]). This\ninterdependence between economic and political struggle also meant\nthat the question of mass strike could not be separated from that of\nrevolution, observed not from the point of view of public order as\n\u201cstreet disturbances\u201d, \u201crioting\u201d and\n\u201cbloodshed\u201d but as a \u201cthoroughgoing internal\nreversal of existing class relations\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR:\n195\u2013196]). And yet precisely because the mass strike should not be\nunderstood as an isolated measure to be called at will but was\ninextricably linked to the fate of revolution, the decision to bring\nit about could not come even from \u201cthe highest committee of the\nstrongest Social Democratic party\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR:\n197]). Of course, Luxemburg conceded that initiative, direction, mass\neducation and party discipline had a crucial role to play in\nrevolutionary organisation. But she was convinced that\n\u201crevolutions do not allow anyone to play schoolmaster with\nthem\u201d because, as she argued, \u201cin every individual act of\nthe struggle so very many important economic, political and social,\ngeneral and local, material and psychical, factors react upon one\nanother in such a way that no single act can be arranged and resolved\nas if it were a mathematical problem\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR:\n198]).\n\n\nThis then, is the essence of what has been labelled her theory of the\nrole of \u201cspontaneity\u201d in political organisation, which is\nnot so much a theory as an effort to understand the dynamic of\npolitical action grounded in the belief that, in the course of\npolitical mobilisation and activity, oppressed groups are themselves\nable to develop the epistemic insight, political tools and collective\nmotivation required to change the course of history. The lesson for\npolitical parties, Luxemburg argued, was not to focus on the\n\u201ctechnical side\u201d, with the \u201cmechanisms of the mass\nstrike\u201d but to ensure that \u201cthey never fall below the\nlevel demanded by the actual relations of forces, but rather rise\nabove it\u201d (Luxemburg 1905 [RLR: 199]). Reforms, she explained,\nprovided crucial learning platforms through which the mass of\noppressed people would develop a capacity for autonomous\ndecision-making, and prepare for the conquest of political power. Yet\nsuch reforms were trials of freedom, they were not freedom itself.\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s analysis of political organisation has received\nseveral critiques from contrasting perspectives. On the one hand, it\nhas been pointed out that while Luxemburg was able to navigate\ncarefully the choice between national parliamentary representation and\na revolutionary analysis of class conflict that transcended state\nboundaries, she opposed the Second International\u2019s na\u00efve\nfaith on national social democracy with a no less na\u00efve belief on\nthe democratising effects of a continuously expanding wave of strikes\n(Eley 1980: 147). On the other hand, her faith in the spontanous power\nof the masses has often been interpreted as the unavoidable\nconsequence of a certain degree of \u201cdeterminism\u201d or\n\u201cfatalism\u201d embedded in her analysis of the limits of\ncapital accumulation and its emphasis on an inherent tendency towards\ncrisis (see for a discussion of this literature Geras 1976 [2015, ch\n1]). However, as Norman Geras has pointed out, while some of the\nphrasing in her texts resembles standard formulations of the\nSecond International to the extent that the collapse of\ncapitalism was perceived as inherently unavoidable, and while this\nrhetoric could occasionally serve a psychological motivating role,\nLuxemburg was far from considering the emergence of socialism a matter\nof fatal destiny (Geras 1976 [2015]). On the contrary, she made it\nclear that socialism was not going to fall as \u201cmanna from\nheaven\u201d and that while \u201cwe can no more skip a period in\nour historical development than a man can jump over his shadow, it\nlies within our power to accelerate or to retard it\u201d (Luxemburg\n1915 [RLR: 320\u2013321]).  The meaning of Engels\u2019s famous slogan\n\u201csocialism or barbarism\u201d, on which Luxemburg commented in\nthe Junius Pamphlet was quite the opposite of determinism:\nthe vindication of the conscious agency of the oppressed, the\ntransformation, she argued, of the proletariat from \u201ca powerless\nvictim of history\u201d to \u201cits conscious guide\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1915 [RLR: 321]).\n\n\nThis belief in the power of the oppressed masses, and the role of\nspontaneous action in developing revolutionary organisation informed\nLuxemburg\u2019s response to her colleagues in the German social\ndemocratic party and her call to combine parliamentary initiatives\nwith the defence of the mass strike as the focal point of\nrevolutionary organisation. The extent to which these views were\nreflected in her attitude to the Polish workers movement, with regard\nto which Luxemburg is sometimes criticised for her rigidity and\nsectarian stance, is a contested question (Blanc 2017). However, there\nis no doubt that her political experience with both Polish and German\norganisations, played an important role in the analysis of the\npolitical developments in Russia, from the revolution of 1905 to the\nBolshevik conquest of power after October 1917. Initially sceptical of\nthe possibility that a workers\u2019 government in Russia could last\nfor a long time, Luxemburg nevertheless praised the Bolsheviks for the\nsymbolic importance of showing to the world that a revolutionary\nprogramme led by the proletariat was worth fighting for despite the\nconstraints imposed by circumstances. She also urged her colleagues in\nthe SPD to abandon their caution and support the Bolsheviks with\ngreater conviction that the oppressed people of Russia would\neventually be able to find their orientation despite what many\nconsidered to be \u201cunripe circumstances\u201d. As she put it in\nher essay on the Russian revolution, writen while in prison during\nWorld War I but published after her death in 1922, \u201cwhen the\nproletariat seizes power, it can never again follow Kautsky\u2019s\ngood advice to dispense with a socialist transformation of a country\non the grounds that\u2018the country is unripe\u2019\u201d. What it\nneeds, she argues, is to \u201cimmediately embark on socialist\nmeasures in the most energetic, the most unyielding and the most\nruthless way; in other words, it must exercise a dictatorship, but a\ndictatorship of the class, not of a party or of a clique \u2013 and\ndictatorship of the class means: in full view of the broadest public,\nwith the most active, uninhibited participation of the popular masses\nin an unlimited democracy\u201d (Luxemburg 1922 [RLR: 25, see also\n307\u2013308]).\n\n\nLuxemburg interpreted the demand for a dictatorship of the proletariat\nin the same way Marx and Engels had done, as a transitional emergency\ninstitution required to realise democracy in a society rigged by class\nstruggle (see for a broader discussion of the concept Ypi 2020). She\nstrongly believed that the dictatorship of the proletariat should be\nbrought about by the masses of the oppressed in their effort to\nliberate themselves, and that it should not be inflicted on them by a\nsmall circle of revolutionary elites. This commitment to freedom as\nreflected in the practical activity of the working class movement\nrather than a static goal to be approximated with the right tools was\nalso reflected in her criticism of centralized models of political\norganization, motivating her scepticism towards the idea of a vanguard\nparty championed by Vladimir Lenin. For Lenin, the political vanguard\nconsisted of a selection of the most disciplined, intellectually\nsophisticated, and motivated revolutionaries whose role was to\ncultivate \u201cagitation\u201d with the aim of transforming\nworkers\u2019 mobilisation to achieve short-term goals into a wide\nranging struggle aiming to secure their access to political\npower. Only a party guided by a small elite of revolutionaries aware\nof the twin dangers of both opportunism (too much compromise) and\nsectarianism (too little compromise), Lenin argued, was capable of\ngiving the working class movement a compass with which to orient\nitself in the long-term (Lenin 1929 [1987: 95]). As Lenin puts it, the\nprofessional revolutionary is not merely a trade union secretary but a\n\u201ctribune of the people\u201d, able to react to injustice\nregardless of where it takes place or which group of people it affects\nso as to \u201cgroup all these manifestations into a single picture\nof political violence [\u2026] in order to explain to everyone the\nworld-historical significance of the struggle\u201d (Lenin 1929\n[1987: 113]).\n\n\nLuxemburg was one of the first to draw attention to the risks of\nprogressive isolation from the wider movement that this conception of\npartisanship entailed. Although she applauded the October Revolution\nof 1917 for showing that the idea of a working class state was no\nhopeless utopia, she insisted that without connection to and guidance\nfrom the masses, the party would soon reach a state of bureaucratic\nstalemate, separate from the concerns of the rest of society which\nwould endanger the very freedoms that socialists promised to\nrealise. As she memorably put it: \u201cFreedom for supporters of the\ngovernment only, for members of one part only \u2013 no matter how\nnumerous they might be is no freedom at all. Freedom is always freedom\nfor those who think differently\u201d (Luxemburg 1922 [RLR:\n305]). This freedom to think differently, she believed could only\nflourish if it remained connected to democracy understood as rule by\nthe oppressed people, maturing the skills, epistemic insight and views\nnecessary to guide them in circumstances of revolutionary\ntransitions. She believed that political education of the mass of the\noppressed, and the ability to develop their views through practice was\nessential to working class rule. While a liberal democratic order\ncould maintain its stability thanks to the cooperation of an already\neducated elite, the challenge for a movement of the oppressed was to\ndevelop the knowledge necessary to develop a new political order in\nthe course of transforming the old one. This is why, democratic\npractice and the idea of historical experimentation as a learning\nprocess was crucial. Not, as Luxemburg put it, because of any\nfanaticism about the \u201cconcept of \u2018justice\u2019 but\nbecause all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political\nfreedom depends on this essential characteristic\u201d, and\n\u201cfreedom\u201d effectively loses its meaning once it becomes a\nprivilege (Luxemburg 1922 [RLR: 305]). Active participation in public\nlife required guaranteeing general elections, freedom of the press and\nassembly, and an uncensored exchange of opinions without which public\nlife \u201cgradually falls asleep\u201d and only buraucracy is kept\nalive.\n\nWhile remaining sensitive to the historical circumstances that\nconstrained the Bolsheviks (war, the pressure from the outside, the\ndifficulties in the development of the working class movement in\nRussia, and the infancy of its democratic institutions), Luxemburg was\none of the first Marxist theorists to highlight the importance of\ncombining the struggle for socialism with that for democracy, and to\nwarn against the dangers of divorcing the two. The history of\nsocialist states in the 20th century has proved her\nright. The concentration of power in the hands of a narrow elite of\nparty officials, the lack of transparency and accountability of\ninstitutions, their progressive isolation from the demands of the\npeople, ultimately led to their demise. The ongoing importance of\nLuxemburg\u2019s writings on the Bolshevik revolution lies not so\nmuch in her commentary on a historical experiment of which she always\ndoubted the capacity to survive historical constraints. It consists in\nwhat they tell us about the ethics of revolution and the difficulties\nof constructing a movement of the oppressed which must realise freedom\nin circumstances in which it may lack the historical maturity,\nmaterial and epistemic means that the maintenance of the status quo\nmakes available.\n6. Women\u2019s emancipation\n\n\nHistorically interpreted as a Marxist theorist at best indifferent to\nthe question of women\u2019s emancipation, recent scholarship has\nbeen more nuanced in their assessments of Luxemburg\u2019s\ncontribution to feminism (Dunayevskaya 1981; Ettinger 1987; Haug\n2007). As with the case of national self-determination, her position\non gender issues is more sophisticated than a simplified reading of\nher texts affords. It is well known that Luxemburg often rejected\ncalls from her colleagues in the Second International to be\nexclusively involved with what they called the \u201cwomen\nquestion\u201d. However, as many of her articles, political\ninterventions and letters make clear, Luxemburg was a fierce champion\nof women\u2019s rights and of the contribution that advocacy for\nwomen representation made to socialist emancipation more\ngenerally. What she did reject is the kind of tokenistic feminism\nwhich limited itself to the suffrage campaign and isolated the\nquestion of female emancipation from the critique of capitalism. As\nshe put it, bourgeois women \u201cwho act like lionessess in the\nstruggle against \u2018male prerogatives\u2019 \u2026 are nothing\nbut co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the\nproletariat\u201d. These \u201cparasites of the parasites of the\nsocial body\u201d, she wrote \u201care usually even more rabid and\ncruel in defending their \u2018right\u2019 to a parasite\u2019s\nlife than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1902 [RLR: 240]).\n\n\nLike her colleagues Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai who were\nactively contributing to the development of socialist feminism,\nLuxemburg also believed that under capitalism women were doubly\noppressed: in the family and in the workplace. Like them, she did not\nthink that conflicts over gender could be reduced to the antagonism\nbetween men and women but argued that they have deeper roots in in a\ncapitalist system where only paid labour is considered productive. In\nthis she could be seen as an early pioneer of social reproduction\ntheory, offering an analysis of capital accumulation in which the\ncommodification of domestic labour is a crucial step in the\nprogressive expansion of capitalist relations to non-capitalist realms\nsuch as the household (Cakardic 2017).\n\n\nWhile Luxemburg did not make this argument directly, her defence of\nwomen\u2019s rights was coupled with a harsh critique of the\ncapitalist system which viewed domestic labour, i.e.  the labour\ntraditionally performed by working women as unproductive, and in which\nproletarian women lacked even the basic political rights to support\ntheir calls to end economic exploitation. This is why, when Belgian\nsocial democrats agreed to an alliance with the liberal party which\nled them to abandon the demand to give votes to women, Luxemburg\ncondemned the agreement in the harshest terms. She insisted that women\nsuffrage would not only improve democratic representation in general\nbut also \u201cclear out the suffocating air of the current,\nphilistine, family life that rubs itself off so unmistakably, even on\nour Party members, workers and leaders alike\u201d (Luxemburg 1902\n[RLR: 236]). \n\n\nYet Luxemburg\u2019s arguments in support of women representation\nwere never confined to a demand for abstract legal recognition in\nliberal parliamentary democracies. She was vividly aware that the few\nprivileges extended to Western feminist campaigners might come at the\nprice of the ongoing exploitation of women in other parts of the\nworld. In an article entitled \u201cProletarian Women\u201d, she\nwrote movingly about the struggles of women in German Africa where\n\u201cthe bones of defenseless Herero women are bleaching in the\nsun\u201d and about \u201cthe high cliffs of Putumayo\u201d where\n\u201cthe death cries of martyred Indian women, ignored by the world,\nfade away in the rubber plantations of the international\ncapitalists\u201d (Luxemburg 1914 [RLR: 245]). In this sense,\nLuxemburg\u2019s calls to advance women\u2019s struggle, were part\nof her more general argument that the demand for social rights\nobtained through parliamentary representation ought to be part of a\nmore radical critique of capitalism where the key is access to\npolitical power and a profound transformation of both the economic and\nthe political structures of society. Within existing capitalist\ninstitutions, she insisted, there could be no true gender and racial\nemancipation. The only secure foundation for the rights of women, she\nargued, was for them to join the social democratic movement where they\ncould affirm their equality through mass orgnisation and protest\nalongside men, and where they could shake the pillars of the existing\nlegal order before it grants them \u201cthe illusion of \u2026\nrights\u201d (Luxemburg 1914 [RLR: 244]).\n7. Influence and legacy\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg\u2019s ideas are still relevant today because they\nbelong to a tradition of socialist thinking whose main concern is with\nfreedom, its development in the course of global history, the\nobstacles to its realisation, and the different types of oppression\nthat capitalist society entrenches, enables or fails to\nabolish. Luxemburg\u2019s analysis of freedom as a philosophical\nconcept is never explicitly brought out in her writings, but often\nappears embedded in a notion of historical agency \u2013 both\nindividual and collective \u2013 which shares the humanism of\nclassical Marxism. Socialism, Luxemburg argued, \u201cis the first\npopular movement in the world that has set itself a goal and has\nestablished in the social life of a human being a conscious thought, a\ndefinite plan, the free will of mankind\u201d (Luxemburg 1915 [RLR:\n320]).\n\n\nFor her, as for Marx and others before him, human beings have a unique\nmoral authority grounded on freedom which provides the basis for a\nradical critique of existing capitalist institutions as well as the\nimpetus to struggle for a genuinly free society. Capitalism hinders\nfreedom because it establishes global patterns of domination and\noppression which sacrifice the freedom of many to the wellbeing of a\nfew. Crucially for Luxemburg though, freedom is not simply an\nend-state, a condition to aspire to at the end of a journey of\npolitical emancipation; it is also actively practiced when those who\nsuffer from injustice express their will through forms of political\nactivism that play an educating role. In this sense, the process of\npolitical emancipation must be self-guided rather than directed by\nothers because the experience accumulated through political practice\nserves as a learning platform in which collective freedom, before\nbeing instutionalised externally through political and legal\nmechanisms, is appropriated internally and exercised through social\nactivism.\n\n\nWhile Luxemburg\u2019s writings are scattered\nand sometimes difficult to read, this commitment to freedom provides\nthe moral and political compass with the help of which we can\nunderstand her contribution to a range of questions: from the limits of\nliberal parliamentarism to the value of self determination, from the\ndynamics of global capital accumulation to the persistence of\nimperialism, from the problem of political organisation to the issue of\nrevolutionary transition. Although like many Marxists of her\ngeneration, Luxemburg was less interested in abstract theoretical\nanalysis and more in how to deploy that analysis as a tool for\npolitical change, her reflections remain a crucial starting point to\ndevelop critical thinking in at least three domains. Firstly, there is\nthe question of how to think about political power in the context of a\nglobal capitalist structure facing continuous crisis, and where the\nburdens of that crisis are distributed disproportionally on oppressed\ngroups of people whose different identities do not neatly overlap with\nthe boundaries between nation states. Luxemburg\u2019s remarks on\nimperialism and capitalist accumulation offer a productive starting\npoint to think about social justice in a way that is historically\nnuanced, sensitive to the development of global capitalism and\nthat escapes the methodological nationalist straightjacket that often\ncharacterises liberal thinking on unequal development. The second is\nthe question of political organisation, the relevance of education, and\nthe costs of transition from one system of laws to another. Here\nLuxemburg\u2019s analysis is useful to think about the ethics of\nrevolution and to orient the debate about how to learn from the trials\nand failures of progressive movements of the past in a way that\ncombines radical commitments with awareness of the necessity of\ncompromise. Finally, her writings are crucial to alert us to different\nforms of oppression that still afflict our world, and to think about\nthem in an intersectional way that brings together the concerns of\ngender, race and class. They enable us to articulate a richer analysis\nof the capitalist system which is genuinely inclusive of the history,\ntheory and practice of oppressed groups of people in different parts of\nthe globe and that tries to unify these concerns instead of isolating\nthem from each other. For all these reasons, and despite the unique,\ntragic, circumstances in which she lived and died, Rosa Luxemburg is a\ncontemporary rather than a martyr.\n",
