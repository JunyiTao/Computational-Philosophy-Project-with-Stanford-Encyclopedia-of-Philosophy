General Outline of the Doctrine of the Transcendentals\n\n\nSome modern scholars define transcendentality in an extensional\nsense. Take for instance:\n\nDef: \u201cA transcendental predicate runs through all the\ncategories and extends beyond to their first cause.\u201d (Owens 1963,\n111)\n\nDef: \u201cX is a transcendental iff the extension of the term that\nnames X is greater than and includes the combined extensions of the\nterms that name each and every one of the categories into which being\nmay be divided.\u201d (Gracia 1992, 115)\n\n\n\nOther scholars stress the necessity of an intensional account, which\nleaves more room for the diversity of medieval views on the meaning of\nthe transcendental. A purely extensional definition of\ntranscendentality can perhaps account for Aquinas\u2019 understanding\nof the transcendental as that which runs through the categories because\nof its commonness, but it explains neither Scotus\u2019 understanding\nof the transcendental as that which is not determined to a genus, nor\nthe early Scotists\u2019 conception of degrees of transcendentality.\nMoreover, it fails to explain why Aristotle and Ibn\n Sina[1]\nmust not be considered to have\nformulated a doctrine of transcendentals even though they indeed\nacknowledged the co-extensionality of transgeneric notions like\n\u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019. What characterized the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals as it was developed in the Latin\ntradition from 1225 onwards was precisely the systematic account of the\ndifferences between transgeneric notions as the inner explications of\nthe concept of \u2018being\u2019.\n\n\nAlthough the Latin term \u2018transcendens\u2019 (i.e.\n\u2018that what surpasses [something]\u2019, pl.\n\u2018transcendentia\u2019) has older roots, indicating the\nnobility of being which is free from matter, its interpretation as\n\u2018transcategorical\u2019 appears first in logical treatises of\nthe 12th century. In the 15th\u201316th century, the term\n\u2018transcendentalis\u2019 (pl.\n\u2018transcendentalia\u2019) was framed as a synonym of\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 in the\n\u2018transgeneric\u2019 sense, probably to distinguish it from the\nearlier sense. If the word \u2018transcendental\u2019 was introduced\nin the 15th\u201316th century, therefore, to extricate the meaning of the\nword \u2018transcendent\u2019 from the confusion with a different and\nolder meaning of the word indicating the nobility of being, then the\nuse of the term \u2018transcendental\u2019 by modern scholars to\nindicate a metaphysical doctrine formulated in the 13th century entails\nan anachronism, innocent perhaps, but manifest.\n\n\nOnce the distinction of \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the sense of\npredicative commonness and \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the sense of\nthe nobility of being is made, a further distinction arises,\narticulating different aspects of the \u2018surpassing\u2019\n(transcensus) expressed by the term \u2018transcendens\u2019\nin the new meaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019: \u201cScholastic\ntranscendental philosophy intends a threefold\n\u2018transcensus\u2019: ontological, logical and\nepistemological. The \u2018transcensus\u2019 is\nprimarily ontological in nature, insofar as it is directed to the\ntranscendentia, which are so called, because these terms\ntranscend the categories of being. But the\n\u2018transcensus\u2019 also possesses a\nlogical-semantical aspect, insofar as it is directed to the\ncommunissima, and an epistemological aspect, insofar as it is\ndirected to the prima, the first conceptions of the intellect.\nBetween these three aspects there exists an inner connection:\ntranscendentals are the \u2018firsts\u2019, since they are most\ncommon; and because of their commonness they transcend the\ncategories.\u201d (Aertsen 2012, 657) In the following, these three\naspects of \u2018surpassing\u2019 will guide the historico-systematic\nelaboration of the new meaning of \u2018transcendens\u2019 as\n\u2018transcendental\u2019.\n\n\nFinally, it has to be noted that this new meaning of\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 as transcendental was itself\nsubject to evolution. The Latin term\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 is translated: \u2018that which\nsurpasses [something]\u2019. The term clearly requires a complement,\ni.e. an indication of what is surpassed in the\n\u2018transcensus\u2019. The history of the\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 can be described in terms of the variety\nof its complements: \u201cThe scholastic concept of\n\u2018transcendental\u2019, which since Albert the Great is the\nproper subject of metaphysics, is opposed to the concept of the\ncategorical. The transcendental is therefore the\ntranscategorical. From the 15th century onwards the transcendental\ndetermination appears frequently in opposition to the so-called\n\u2018super-transcendental\u2019, i.e. the most universal\ndeterminations like \u2018opinabile\u2019 or\n\u2018intelligibile\u2019 that are common to real beings\nand beings of reason. With a view to this opposite concept of the\n\u2018super-transcendental\u2019, the transcendental is to be\nconceived as a most common determination that applies to all real\nbeings, including God (\u2026). This constellation of concepts\nchanges with Kant. The concept of transcendental as the common\npredicate of a certain type of cognition is opposed to the concept of\nthe empirical.\u201d (See the entry \u2018Transzendental\u2019, in\nHistorisches W\u00f6rterbuch der Philosophie, Volume 10,\npp. 1358\u20139.)  Since especially the Kantian understanding of the\ntranscendental has been influential for modern minds, it must be\nemphasized at the outset that the medieval understanding of\ntranscendental is not opposed to the empirical, but to the\ncategorical; in fact, all medieval authors acknowledge an empirical\norigin of the transcendental notions. They articulate this connection\nbetween transcendental and empirical in a realist program of\nmetaphysics.\n",
