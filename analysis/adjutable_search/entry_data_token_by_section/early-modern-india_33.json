    "main_text": "The Ontology of Nonexistence (abh\u0101va) and the Semantics of Negative Statements || Motivations\n11.1 Motivations\n\nThe later Naiy\u0101yikas develop a remarkable theory of nonexistence.\nAccording to them, the absence of an object or feature at a\nparticular spatial or temporal location is a state of affairs just as\nobjective as the presence of the object or feature there. To\nKan\u0101\u1e0da\u2019s original list of six categories\n(pad\u0101rtha) or types of existent, they therefore add a\nseventh, \u2018absence\u2019 (abh\u0101va). This\nontological doctrine is underpinned by (i) phenomenological and (ii)\nsemantic considerations.\n\n(i) The phenomenological point was that a negative awareness, say that\na certain person is not in the room, is a kind of awareness\nphenomenally distinct from any awareness about what is in the room.\nCognition of what is not has an autonomous phenomenology (this idea is\nnotably articulated by Sartre). The principle appealed to is thus:\n\nP1\nExperiences of nonexistence are phenomenally distinct from, and\n  irreducible to, experiences of existents.\n\n\nThe idea emerges in the Ny\u0101ya epistemology with their claim that\nabsence is perceived, and that this perception is a sui\ngeneris type of perceptual experience, not reducible to a\ncombination of ordinary perception and inference (cf. the sixth type\nof sensory connection in Uddyotakara\u2019s list).\n\n(ii) The semantic point is that the Ny\u0101ya espouse a version of\nthe correspondence theory of truth, according to which true sentences\ncorrespond to facts. It is alleged that true negative sentences (e.g.\n\u201cThe pot is not on the ground\u201d) correspond to\n\u2018negative facts\u2019. Facts, however, are all, for the\nNy\u0101ya, of the same basic relational form, \u2018bRa\u2019 (they\nare said to have a qualificand-relation-qualifier structure; i.e. they\nare complexes of existing entities). This restriction on what\nconstitutes a fact is expressible via the following semantical\nprinciple:\n\nP2\nSentences correspond to facts constructed out of simple or\ncomplex entities (i.e. entities like \u2018a\u2019, \u2018absence\nof a\u2019, \u2018a-&-b\u2019, \u2018a-or-b\u2019).\n\n\nThe principle entails that one cannot use the truth-functional\nconnectives to construct facts, except where they are equivalent to\nterm-logical connectives. (For example, the sentence \u201cRama and\nSita are righteous\u201d is equivalent to \u201cRama is righteous\nand Sita is righteous\u201d, but the term-connective in \u201cRama\nand Sita are married\u201d is not similarly eliminable in favour of\nthe truth-functional conjunction \u201cRama is married and Sita is\nmarried\u201d.) The point is that a sentence like \u201cThe pot is\nnot on the ground\u201d cannot correspond to a fact of the form\n\u2018\u00acbRa\u2019 (as there are no such facts according to\nP2), but must rather correspond to a fact of the form\n\u2018bR\u0101\u2019. Hence the introduction into one\u2019s\nontology of negative entities.\n",
