    "main_text": "The Hierarchy of Being\n5. The Hierarchy of Being\n\n\nThe Khazar king is soon reminded that while he may have been\nthe beneficiary of the Indian king's largesse in the parable, the\nsage's point was to show that the children of Israel were the\nactual beneficiaries of divine largesse in reality. What is more, he\nhimself senses that their legacy seems to be confined to themselves.\nEven though the sage explains that all who join them will share in\ntheir good fortune, he also qualifies this by noting that they will\nnevertheless not be equal to lineal descendants of Israel, since the\nlatter are \u201cthe choicest of the descendants of Adam.\u201d (K\n1:26\u201327) Despite the king's obvious dismay, he is nonetheless\nsufficiently curious about what lies behind this puzzling claim that he\nagrees to the sage's request to be allowed to broaden his\nexplanation of it.\n\n\nHalevi's task at this juncture is not only to explain\nhow God could have entered into contact with mere flesh and blood to\nprovide instruction about what is pleasing and displeasing to him, but\nalso to explain how only Israel could have\nreceived this instruction. His strategy for explaining both\nsuccessfully is to build upon the king's skepticism regarding\nclaims of direct divine-human contact in order to strengthen his case\nby raising such contacts to a higher level. Accordingly, the sage calls\nthe king's attention to the familiar hierarchical structure of\nthe empirical world, namely, the ascending orders of living beings that\ncan be perceived by the senses\u2014plants, animals, and human beings\nendowed with intellect. He also wins the king's basic assent to\nhis classification of each order\n(amr) or level\n(rutbah) by reference to the\nvarious abilities and/or activities that distinguish the creatures that\nbelong to it. When the king is then asked what level might be above the\nintellectual order, which distinguishes human beings as rational\nanimals from all other animals by virtue of their concern with\nimproving character traits, the household, and the city through\nman-made laws and political institutions, he maintains that there is\nnone higher than that of great savants. To this, the sage counters that\nthey, too, belong to the intellectual order, since they differ from\nother human beings only in degree, not in kind. So he asks about what\nappears to be yet another hypothetical case: If he were to find someone\nwith an utterly extraordinary capacity for surviving amidst\nlife-threatening circumstances as well as amazing self-mastery and\nknowledge of hidden things pertaining to both the past and the future,\nwould this not represent an essentially different level? The king\nresponds that it amounts to even more than that; it would be the divine\nlevel characteristic of God's own kingdom,\nif it exists. In addition, the person\ndescribed would come under the dominion of the divine order\n(al-amr al-ilahi). After the\nking's qualified revision of the hierarchy's true extent,\nit remains only for the sage to explain that what he described were, in\nfact, the attributes of the undisputed prophet through whom multitudes\nof Israelites became aware of God's attachment to them and also\nof the fact that God governs them in accordance with both his will and\ntheir own obedience and disobedience, as recorded in the Bible's\nhistorical and genealogical narratives. (K 1: 31\u201343)\n\n\nIn effect, then, the sage makes use of the king's\ndoubts about God's communicating with ordinary\nhuman beings to persuade him that God might plausibly do so\nwith super-human beings. It\nis not that the prophets, who exemplify the latter category, are not\nflesh and blood, but rather that the qualities which distinguish their\nsouls (recalling the Khazar's concluding remarks to the\nphilosopher in K 1:4) raise them far above that level so as to belong,\nquite literally, to one that is essentially different from and higher\nthan all the others, namely, \u201cthe divine order.\u201d Once this\nis granted, there is no longer any insurmountable barrier between God,\nangels, and human beings of a certain\nkind that would preclude, in principle, contact\nor communication between them, even though their respective powers and\nranks within the same order differ greatly. In this sense, prophets\nbelong to the divine order and speak on its behalf, just as the\nmessenger in the sage's parable comes from India with the\nking's letter and appropriate gifts because he belongs to that\nkingdom and was duly commissioned by its ruler. By the same token,\nhowever, the king's appointed messengers might also be dispatched\nto other members of the kingdom with announcements, instructions,\nreproaches, or other communications for their benefit. Indeed, all of\nthese would be evidence of the king's attachment to them. They,\nin turn, as subjects of the king, could be expected to have access to\nhim, and if they also had all of the requisite qualifications, they\nmight also become messengers, i.e., prophets, themselves. By\nextrapolating thus from the sage's parable, it becomes clear why\nIsrael alone is designated as the choicest of Adam's descendents\nand the recipient of God's instructions. Israel, too, belongs to\nthe divine order or kingdom and comes under God's own\ndominion.\n\n\nIt should be noted, however, that interpretations of exactly\nwhat Halevi meant by the very significant term al-amr\nal-ilahi vary greatly. While there is a general\nconsensus that it signifies experienced aspects of divinity in nature\nand especially in history, explanations and descriptions range from the\nvery abstract (e.g., \u201cthe divine matter,\u201d \u201cthe divine\nthing,\u201d \u201cthe divine,\u201d \u201can aura enveloping the\npeople and land of Israel\u201d) to a wide array of specific instances\nor manifestations (e.g., \u201cGod as such,\u201d \u201cGod's\nwill,\u201d \u201ca super-rational faculty in man for\nprophecy,\u201d \u201cdivine light\u201d). In order to clarify and\norganize the basic connotations of the term in a way that enables us to\nmake sense of all of Halevi's specific usages, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between three distinct yet related connotations originally\nsuggested by Shlomo Pines. He based them on his study of Shiite and\nIsmaili terminology used in the\nKuzari, but they are introduced here\nbecause of their direct correlation with Halevi's clearest uses\nof the term in the first parts of the dialogue.\n\n\nThe first and most basic connotation of al-amr\nal-ilahi signifies an arrangement, dispensation\nor ordering of things which governs the affairs of all who belong to\nand participate in it, such as angels, prophets, and pious friends of\nGod, among others. (K 1: 4, 41\u201343; 3: 5) Thus, \u201cthe divine\norder,\u201d one of several literal renderings of the Arabic term,\ncorresponds to the supreme level in the hierarchy of things, which God,\nits supreme member, has willed to be as it is. The second connotation\nof \u201cthe divine order,\u201d which is derived from the first,\nsignifies the gift or influx of prophecy, both as an experience of the\ndivine and as the power, capacity, or faculty within the soul that\nenables one to apprehend it. (K 1: 4, 25, 43, 95, 97, 109) It is\ntypically bestowed on those belonging to the divine dispensation as a\nsign of favor or recognition of noble rank in a special audience with\nGod or a divine appointee that typically confers recondite information,\nspecific instructions, and special powers to speak or act on his\nbehalf, along with the possibility of future access. In this sense,\nbestowal of the divine order\nquaprophetic gift is comparable to\nwhat a patron does in awarding an order of merit or a commission to his\nclient or what a monarch does when conferring the Order of the Empire\nupon a worthy subject. The third and final connotation of \u201cthe\ndivine order\u201d signifies orders or commands in the conventional\nsense of directives that mandate what pleases God and prohibit what\ndispleases him. However, even this very specific sense of the term\nsometimes allows for a broader usage that signifies the power or\nauthority that lies behind such commands. (K 1: 87,\n98; 2: 4, 6, 50; 3:23, 53)\nReferences to the divine order in this third sense clearly presuppose\nthe prior reception of prophecy itself and whatever knowledge or\ninstruction it provides, plus the transmission of such knowledge over\ntime through reliable tradition from parent to child and teacher to\nstudent. Without these, one can only speculate about divine things in\ngeneral terms and largely out of ignorance.\n",
