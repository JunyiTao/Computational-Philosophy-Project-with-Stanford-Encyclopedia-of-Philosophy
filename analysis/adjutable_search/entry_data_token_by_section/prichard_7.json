    "main_text": "Significant Issues on Which Prichard Changed His Mind || The nature of action\n6.2 The nature of action\n\nAt the beginning of his career Prichard writes \u2018In action we\nconsciously originate a change\u2019 (1). On p.10 he speaks\napparently without strain both of our action as being the origination\nof a change and as originating that change, and of ourselves as\noriginating that change. In the Manuscript on Morals (of uncertain\ndate, perhaps c. 1928), we read that the phrase \u2018an\naction\u2019 is ambiguous, but \u2018ordinarily it stands for the\norigination or bringing something about \u2026 such as the action of\npoking a fire or annoying a neighbour\u2019.\n\nBy 1932 he has moved on, but only a little. \u2018It is, no doubt,\nnot easy to say what we mean by \u2018an action\u2019 or by\n\u2018doing something\u2019. Yet we have in the end to allow that we\nmean by it originating, causing, or bringing about the existence of\nsomething, viz. some new state of an existing thing or substance, or,\nmore shortly, causing a change of state of some existing thing.\n\u2026 We may be tempted to go farther, and say that we mean by\n\u2018an action\u2019 the conscious origination of something, i.e.\nthe originating something knowing that we are doing so. But this will\nnot do; for no one, for instance, thinks himself to be denying that he\nhas hurt a person\u2019s feelings when he says that he did not know\nthat he was hurting them, and, indeed, thought he was not\u2019\n(85).\n\nBut at this point Prichard introduces a distinction between what we\ncause directly and what we cause indirectly. He says that when we\ncause something indirectly, by causing something else to cause it,\n\u2018the result is not wholly due to us\u2019. When we cause\nsomething directly, by contrast, it is wholly due to us. And Prichard\ngives us an example of such a thing, namely \u2018transferring\ncertain ink to certain places on a piece of paper\u2019. But he\nmaintains that if such a thing were an obligation, it would be the\nsort of obligation we would never be able to know that we have,\nbecause we can never know what will in fact result. If we are to be\ncapable of knowing our obligations, they cannot be obligations which\nwe cannot know that we have met when we have met them. If so, our\nobligations cannot be to achieve this or that outcome, but only to\n\u2018set ourselves to achieve them\u2019. All actions that are\nobligatory are of this sort. And Prichard evidently concludes that\nwhen we cause a change directly, in each case there is such a thing as\n\u2018setting oneself to cause that change\u2019, which may be\nsuccessful and may not be. An action that is a failure is still an\naction. So though we may describe an action in terms of its further\neffects, say lighting the fire, a necessary part of that action will\nhave been a \u2018setting oneself to \u2026\u2019.\n\nAt the end of his life, in 1945, he writes that the view he has\ninherited from Cook Wilson, namely that to act is to originate a\nchange, has to be wrong. In fact, to act is to will a change, and the\nchange willed is not an action; most often it is a bodily movement,\nthat is to say, a change in the location of one\u2019s body or of\nparts of it. He says that the characterization of willing as\n\u2018setting oneself to cause a change\u2019 has to be wrong.\n\u201cI now think I was mistaken in suggesting that the phrase in use\nfor it is \u2018setting oneself to cause\u2019\u201d (274).\n\nThe reason he gives for abandoning the Cook Wilson picture is that an\naction is an activity, and there is no such activity as that of\noriginating or causing a change in oneself or anything else (273).\nEven if causing a change may require an activity, it is not that\nactivity. Now often we do not know what activity is involved when one\nbody causes a change in another. But when it comes to human actions,\nwe do know. First, we know that we are looking for something mental,\nand second, we know that the word for that special kind of mental\nactivity is \u2018willing\u2019.\n\nVery little can be said about this mental activity of willing, though\nwe are all, of course, perfectly familiar with it. But we can ask\nabout its proper object. What is it that we will? Two possible answers\npresent themselves: we will actions, and we will changes. The first of\nthese must be wrong because it generates an infinite regress. So the\nsecond must be right. An action is the willing of a change.\n",
