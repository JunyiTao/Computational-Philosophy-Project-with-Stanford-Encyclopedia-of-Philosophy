    "main_text": "Objections to Mathematical Platonism || A metaphysical objection\n3.2 A metaphysical objection\n\nAnother famous article by Benacerraf develops a metaphysical objection\nto mathematical platonism (Benacerraf 1965, cf. also Kitcher 1978).\nAlthough Benacerraf focuses on arithmetic, the objection naturally\ngeneralizes to most pure mathematical objects.\n\nBenacerraf opens by defending what is now known as a structuralist\nview of the natural numbers, according to which the natural numbers\nhave no properties other than those they have in virtue of being\npositions in an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence. For instance, there is nothing\nmore to being the number 3 than having certain intrastructurally\ndefined relational properties, such as succeeding 2, being half of 6,\nand being prime. No matter how hard we study arithmetic and set\ntheory, we will never know whether 3 is identical with the fourth von\nNeumann ordinal, or with the corresponding Zermelo ordinal, or\nperhaps, as Frege suggested, with the class of all three-membered\nclasses (in some system that allows such classes to exist).\n\nBenacerraf now draws the following conclusion:\n\nTherefore, numbers are not objects at all, because in giving the\nproperties \u2026of numbers you merely characterize an abstract\nstructure\u2014and the distinction lies in the fact that the\n\u201celements\u201d of the structure have no properties other than\nthose relating them to other \u201celements\u201d of the same\nstructure. (Benacerraf 1965, p. 291)\n\n\nIn other words, Benacerraf claims that there can be no objects which\nhave nothing but structural properties. All objects must have some\nnon-structural properties as well. (See Benacerraf 1996 for some later\nreflections on this argument.)\n\nBoth of the steps of Benacerraf\u2019s argument are controversial.\nThe first step\u2014that natural numbers have only structural\nproperties\u2014has been defended by a variety of mathematical\nstructuralists (Parsons 1990, Resnik 1997, and Shapiro 1997, as well\nas Schiemer & Wigglesworth 2019 for the notion of a structural\nproperty). But this step is denied by logicists and neo-logicists, who\nclaim that the natural numbers are intrinsically tied to the\ncardinalities of the collections that they number (Wright 2000). And\nthe second step\u2014that there can be no objects with only\nstructural properties\u2014is explicitly rejected by all of the\nstructuralists who defend the first step. (For some voices sympathetic\nto the second step, see Hellman 2001 and MacBride 2005. See also\nLinnebo 2008 for discussion.)\n",
