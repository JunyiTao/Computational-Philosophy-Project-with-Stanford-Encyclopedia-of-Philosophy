    "main_text": "Riemannian geometry || Riemann and Beltrami and rigorous non-Euclidean geometry\n5.2 Riemann and Beltrami and rigorous non-Euclidean geometry\n\nRiemann\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber die Hypothesen \u2026\u201d\n(given as a lecture in 1854, published posthumously in 1868) and\nBeltrami\u2019s \u201cSaggio di interpretazione\u201d\n(1868) gave different but equivalent accounts of 2-dimensional\nnon-Euclidean geometry. Beltrami employed differential geometry to\njustify the hyperbolic geometry of Lobachevskii-Bolyai. By studying\nthe pseudosphere and how it can be mapped onto the plane (in such a\nway that its geodesics went to straight lines), Beltrami realized that\nthe unit disk can be viewed as an \u2018infinite plane\u2019. It had\nbeen impossible to find a surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) that behaved\nlike the hyperbolic plane (the closest, but partial, being the\npseudosphere); now it was possible to realize non-Euclidean geometry\nas the geometry of the interior of a disk with a novel metric. The\ndisk is the whole \u2018plane\u2019, its circumference a line at\ninfinity, line segments in the disk are \u2018lines\u2019, and one\ncan define a distance function\n\\(d(P,Q)\\) that makes sense and validates Lobachevskii\u2019s\nresults. From the logical point of view, this was an enormous step\nforward, as the consistency of non-Euclidean geometry was now\nproven.\n\nRiemann\u2019s account, which was stated in \\(n\\) dimensions, agrees\nwith the one that Poincar\u00e9 was to use in many short\npublications in 1880 and 1881 but only describe explicitly in his\nmajor paper (Poincar\u00e9 1882). In this so-called\nconformal model, the plane is again a disk, geodesics are\narcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary of the disk and angles\nare true (Euclidean). The Riemann and Beltrami disks swiftly persuaded\nmathematicians that the non-Euclidean geometry of Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did, after all, make rigorous mathematical sense.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s contribution a decade later was to make\nnon-Euclidean geometry the natural geometry for certain topics\nelsewhere in mathematics, chiefly the developing and important subject\nof Riemann surfaces.\n\nThe importance of a rigorous account of any part of mathematics should\nnot be ignored, but the acceptance of non-Euclidean and Riemannian\ngeometries went beyond the presentation of a consistent formalism. It\nmarks the acceptance of the abstract view that geometry is whatever\ncan be described in the Riemannian formalism: one has a very general\nframework, allowing for a dizzying number of concrete specifications.\nThus the door was opened to the view that there are many geometries,\neach of which must be consistent, and none of which need to refer to\nEuclidean space, however intuitive this may be. (A parallel\ndevelopment with similar outcome happened in the context of projective\ngeometry with Klein's work.) The number of dimensions of the\n\u2018space\u2019 under discussion, and the precise metric can be\nmodified at will (in due course, the topological character of that\n\u2018space\u2019 would be treated similarly). There is a\n2-dimensional geometry of such-and-such a kind because a suitable\nmetric can be found; because there is, as it were, a map of it, not\nbecause a surface has been found in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) with the right\nproperties. Indeed, it was later shown (Hilbert 1901) that there is no\nsurface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) corresponding precisely to non-Euclidean\n2-dimensional space.\n\nRiemann was clear that the epistemological implications of this way of\ndoing geometry were immense. His lecture was a happy combination of\nmathematics, philosophy and physics (Ferreir\u00f3s 2006). Mathematicians\nshould no longer need to abstract some fundamental intuitions from\nwhat they believe about physical space, such as the nature and\nproperties of straight lines or circles, and seek to build a true\ngeometry on the basis of some axiomatic expression of those\nintuitions. Rather, the direction of thought should go in the opposite\ndirection: mathematicians were free to consider infinitely many\ngeometries. Riemann speculated about the validity of the hypotheses of\ngeometry \"in the infinitely small\" being possibly bound up with the\nphysical forces. Scientists could now freely investigate which\ngeometry is best for the mathematical explanation of empirical facts.\nHe envisioned the abandonment of the Newtonian conception of\nphenomena, \"by making in this conception the successive changes\nrequired by facts which it cannot explain.\" His purely conceptual\n(mathematical) research would be useful \"in preventing this work from\nbeing hampered by too narrow views, and progress in knowledge of the\ninterdependence of things from being checked by traditional\nprejudices.\" In this connection, it was soon shown that it is possible\nto do theoretical mechanics in the setting of non-Euclidean\ngeometry.\n",
