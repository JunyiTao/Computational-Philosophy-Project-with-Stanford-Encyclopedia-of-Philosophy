    "main_text": "Applications || Collaborative problem solvers and intelligent tutors\n10.8 Collaborative problem solvers and intelligent tutors\n\nWe discuss collaborative problem solving systems (also referred to as\n\u201cmixed-initiative\u201d or \u201ctask-oriented\u201d dialogue\nsystems) and tutorial dialogue systems (i.e., tutorial systems in\nwhich dialogue plays a pivotal role) under a common heading because\nboth depend on rather deep representations or models of the domains\nthey are aimed at as well as the mental state of the users they\ninteract with.\n\nHowever, we should immediately note that collaborative problem solving\nsystems typically deal with much less predictable domain situations\nand user inputs than tutorial systems, and accordingly the former\nplace much greater emphasis on flexible dialogue handling than the\nlatter. For example, collaborators in emergency evacuation (Ferguson\nand Allen 1998, 2007) need to deal with a dynamically changing domain,\nat the same time handling the many dialogue states that may occur,\ndepending on the participants' shared and private beliefs, goals,\nplans and intentions at any given point. By contrast, in a domain such\nas physics tutoring (e.g., Jordan et al. 2006; Litman and\nSilliman 2004), the learner can be guided through a network of\nlearning goals with authored instructions, and corresponding to those\ngoals, finite-state dialogue models can be designed that classify\nstudent inputs at each point in a dialogue and generate a prepared\nresponse likely to be appropriate for that input.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that tutorial dialogue systems are\ncloser to commercial practicality, with demonstrated learning benefits\nrelative to conventional instruction in various evaluations, than\ncollaborative problem solving systems for realistic applications.\nTutorial dialogue systems have been built for numerous domains and\npotential clienteles, ranging from K-12 subjects to computer literacy\nand novice programming, qualitative and quantitative physics, circuit\nanalysis, operation of machinery, cardiovascular physiology, fire\ndamage control on ships, negotiation skills, and more (e.g., see Boyer\net al. 2009; Pon-Barry et al. 2006). Among the most successful\ntutorial systems are reading tutors (e.g., Mostow and Beck 2007; Cole\net al. 2007), since the materials presented to the learner (in a\n\u201cscaffolded\u201d manner) are relatively straightforward to\ndesign in this case, and the responses of the learner, especially when\nthey consist primarily of reading presented text aloud, are relatively\neasy to evaluate. For the more ambitious goal of fostering reading\ncomprehension, the central problem is to design dialogues so as to\nmake the learner's contributions predictable, while also making the\ninteraction educationally effective (e.g., Aist and Mostow 2009).\nSome tutoring systems, especially ones aimed at children, use\nanimated characters to heighten the learner's sense of\nengagement. Such enhancements are in fact essential for systems\naimed at learners with disabilities like deafness (where mouth and\ntongue movements of the virtual agent observed by the learner can help\nwith articulation), autism, or aphasia (Massaro et al. 2012; Cole et\nal. 2007). As well, if tutoring is aimed specifically at\ntraining\ninterpersonal skills, implementation of life-like characters (virtual\nhumans) becomes an indispensable part of system development (e.g., Core\net al. 2006; Campbell et al. 2011).\nModeling the user's state of mind in tutoring systems is primarily a\nmatter of determining which of the targeted concepts and skills have,\nor have not yet, been acquired by the user, and diagnosing\nmisunderstandings that are likely to have occurred, given the session\ntranscript so far. Some recent experimental systems can also adapt\ntheir strategies to the user's apparent mood, such as frustration or\nboredom, as might be revealed by the user's inputs, tone of voice, or\neven facial expressions or gestures analyzed via computer vision. \nOther prototype systems can be viewed as striving towards more general\nmental modeling, by incorporating ideas and techniques from\ntask-oriented dialogue systems concerning dialogue states, dialogue\nacts, and deeper language understanding (e.g., Callaway et al. 2007).\nIn task-oriented dialogue systems, as already noted, dialogue\nmodeling is much more challenging, since such systems are expected not\nonly to contribute to solving the domain problem at hand, but to\nunderstand the user's utterances, beliefs, and intentions, and to hold\ntheir own in a human-like, mixed-initiative dialogue. This requires\ndomain models, general incremental collaborative planning methods,\ndialogue management that models rational communicative interaction, and\nthorough language understanding (especially intention recognition) in\nthe chosen domain. Prototype systems have been successfully built\nfor domains such as route planning, air travel planning, driver and\npedestrian guidance, control and operation of external devices,\nemergency evacuation, and medication advising (e.g., Allen et al. 2006;\nRich and Sidner 1998; B\u00fchler and Minker 2011; Ferguson and Allen\n1998, 2007), and these hold very significant practical promise.\nHowever, systems that can deal with a variety of reasonably complex\nproblems, especially ones requiring broad commonsense knowledge about\nhuman cognition and behavior, still seem out of reach at this time.\n",
