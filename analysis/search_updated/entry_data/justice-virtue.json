    "preamble": "\n\nThe notion of justice as a virtue began in reference to a trait of\nindividuals, and to some extent remains so, even if today we often\nconceive the justice of individuals as having some (grounding)\nreference to social justice. But from the start, the focus on justice\nas a virtue faced pressures to diffuse, in two different ways.\n\nFirst, \u201cjustice as a virtue\u201d is ambiguous as between\nindividual and social applications. Rawls and others regard justice as\n\u201cthe first virtue of social institutions\u201d (1971, p. 3),\nbut Rawls is not the first to think of justice as a virtue of social\ninstitutions or societies \u2014 Plato was there long before him.\nHowever, justice as a virtue of societies, polities, and their\ninstitutions is addressed\n elsewhere,\n so the focus in this essay will be on justice as a virtue in\nindividuals. That said, individuals typically live as members of\npolitical communities, so the societal dimension of justice as a\nvirtue will never be long out of view (Woodruff 2018).\n\nSecond, from the start the effort to analyze the virtue of\njustice has led to attempts to formalize the requirements (or\nnorms) of justice, and at times the latter project has threatened to\nswallow the first in ways that make thinking of a virtue of\njustice gratuitous or otiose. We might be tempted to think that the\nvirtue of justice consists simply in compliance with the norms of\njustice our theory specifies: a just person will be one who complies\nwith the norms of justice, whether those are narrowly interpersonal or\nmore broadly social or political in scope. In this way the virtue\nbecomes subsidiary to norms of justice independently specified\n(Anderson 2010, p. 2; LeBar 2014). Doing so threatens to lose the\nforce that the notion of virtue had in the earliest thinking about\njustice. \n\nA further complication is that even the idea of justice as a virtue of\nindividuals seems ambiguous in regard to scope. Plato in the\nRepublic treats justice as an overarching virtue of both\nindividuals and societies, so that almost every issue he (or we) would\nregard as ethical comes in under the notion of justice. But in later\nusages justice covers only part of individual morality, and we\ndon\u2019t readily think of someone as unjust if they lie or\nneglect their children \u2014 other epithets more readily spring to\nmind. Individual justice first and most readily regards moral issues\nhaving to do with distributions of goods or property. It is, we say,\nunjust for someone to steal from people or not to give them what he\nowes them, and it is also unjust if someone called upon to distribute\nsomething good (or bad or both) among members of a group uses an\narbitrary or unjustified basis for making the distribution. Discussion\nof justice as an individual virtue often centers on questions,\ntherefore, about property and other distributable goods, though the\nbroader sense broached by Plato never entirely disappears. Still there\nis disagreement over whether the broader distributive questions\nassociated with political morality have subordinated or obscured the\nearlier Greek concerns with justice as a virtue of individual\ncharacter (Hursthouse 1999, pp. 5\u20136; Coope 2007; Lu 2017).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n1.1 Ancient\n\nPhilosophical discussion of justice begins with Plato, who treats the\ntopic in a variety of dialogues, most substantially in\nRepublic. There Plato offers the first sustained discussion\nof the nature of justice (dikaiosune) and its relation to\nhappiness, as a departure from three alternatives receiving varying\ndegrees of attention. First, there is a traditionalist conception of\njustice (speaking the truth and paying your debts). Second, Plato has\nSocrates rebut the Sophist conception of justice which built on a\ndistinction between nature (phusis) and convention\n(nomos) As Plato has this conception articulated by\nThrasymachus in Book I, justice is simply the \u201cadvantage of the\nstronger,\u201d not tracking anything like the sort of value\nattributed to it by traditionalists. Finally, Plato has Socrates\nconfront a conventionalist conception of justice that anticipates\nmodern contractarian views, in which justice \u2014 forbearing\npreying on others in exchange for not being preyed on by them \u2014\nis a \u201csecond-best alternative,\u201d not as good as being able\nto prey at will upon others, but better than being the prey of others.\nThese last two challenges give rise to the central question of the\nbook: to whose advantage is justice? Would we really be better off\nbeing unjust if we could get away with it? Plato\u2019s negative\nanswer to that question is the project of the balance of the work.\n\nPlato\u2019s method involves the provocative idea that justice in the\ncity (polis) is the same thing as justice in the individual,\njust \u201cwrit large.\u201d There are good reasons to worry about\nthat assumption (Williams 1973; Keyt 2006). But in Plato\u2019s\nsociology of the city, there are three classes engaged in a kind of\ndivision of labor. There is a guardian class which rules, a class of\n\u201cauxiliaries\u201d that provide the force behind the ruling,\nand the class of merchants that produce to satisfy the needs and\ndesires of the city. Similarly, the psyche of the individual has three\nparts: a reasoning part to rule, a \u201cspirited\u201d part to\nsupport the rule of reason, and an appetitive part. Plato finds\njustice in the city to consist in each part \u201chaving and doing\nits own,\u201d and since the smaller is just like the larger, justice\nin the individual consists in each part of the psyche doing its own\nwork. (This grounds the idea, later enshrined by Justinian, that\njustice is \u201cgiving every man his due;\u201d Justinian I.i).\nFurther, Plato argues, justice is a master virtue in a sense, because\nin both the city and the psyche, if each part is doing its own job,\nboth city and psyche will also have wisdom, courage, and moderation or\nself-discipline. This conception of justice sustains the contrast with\nthe conventionalist view advocated by the Sophists. On the other hand,\nat least initially it leaves it an open question whether the just\nindividual refrains from such socially proscribed actions as lying,\nkilling, and stealing. Plato eventually seeks to show that someone\nwith a healthy, harmonious soul wouldn\u2019t lie, kill, or steal,\nbut it is not clear that argument succeeds, nor, if it does, that that\nis the right understanding of why we ought not to lie, kill, or steal\n(Sachs 1963; LeBar 2013, ch. XII).\n\nPlato gives a somewhat different treatment of justice in\nCrito, in which Socrates\u2019 eponymous friend attempts to\npersuade Socrates to accept his (Crito\u2019s) offer to bribe a way\nout of the death sentence Socrates is waiting to have executed. Here\nPlato\u2019s arguments first associate the just life with the good\nlife, thus the life Socrates has most reason to live. And justice, he\nthen argues, requires not only not inflicting wrong or injury on\nothers, even in response to wrongs from them, but fulfilling\none\u2019s agreements, and \u2014 in particular \u2014 abiding by\none\u2019s (tacit or explicit) agreement to abide by the laws of the\ncity unless one can persuade it to change them. Of course, justice\ncannot require one to abide by laws that require one to act unjustly,\nas Socrates\u2019 own case (as characterized in Apology)\nshows (Kraut 1984).\n\nIt is worth noting (as Johnston 2011 observes) that even if Plato\u2019s\nis the first philosophical discussion of justice, a concern\nwith what an individual is due as a matter of justice is a driving\nissue in Homer\u2019s Iliad, though there is no counterpart\nconcern there with justice as a property of a society or tribe. So\neven Plato\u2019s philosophical concerns are building on well-established\nquestions about what justice requires of us in our treatment of one\nanother.\n\nAristotle does not see the virtue of justice in quite the\ncomprehensive sense Plato does; he treats it as a virtue of character\n(in the entirety of one of the ten books of the Nicomachean\nEthics, also common to the Eudemian Ethics), and as a\nvirtue of constitutions and political arrangements (in\nPolitics). The question naturally arises as to the relation\nbetween these forms of justice. Aristotle seems to think they are\nclosely related, without being synonymous applications of the same\nconcept. As the latter is a conception of political justice, we will\nfocus here on the former. Justice as a personal virtue follows\nAristotle\u2019s model for virtues of character, in which the virtue\nlies as an intermediate or mean between vices of excess and defect\n(Nicomachean Ethics V). While he grants that there is a\n\u201cgeneral\u201d sense of justice in which justice is coincident\nwith complete virtue, there is a \u201cparticular\u201d sense in\nwhich it is concerned with not overreaching (pleonexia). It\nis not clear, however, exactly how Aristotle understands this\narrangement, or the nature of the vices of excess and defect which\nthis \u201cparticular\u201d justice is to counteract. One very\nplausible reading has it that justice is opposed to a desire for\nmaldistribution of \u201cgoods of fortune\u201d such as money, fame,\nor honor (Williams 1980; Curzer 1995). On another it is opposed to an\ninsufficient attention to others\u2019 rights (Foot 1988, p. 9). On\nstill another it focuses on the goods of others, or common goods\n(O\u2019Connor 1988; Miller 1995).\n\nThese issues remain open in part because Aristotle seems most\ninterested in establishing a conception of the formal\nstructure of \u201cparticular\u201d justice, which seems to\nreflect a conception of desert. He distinguishes between justice in\ndistribution and justice in rectification. The former, he claims,\nadheres to a kind of proportionality, in which what each deserves is\nproportional to the relationship between the contributions. If A\ncontributes twice as much as B (of whatever the metric of merit is\nrelevant in some particular case), then A\u2019s return ought also to\nbe twice B\u2019s. This conception of distributive justice obviously\nlends itself to \u201cgoods of fortune\u201d \u2014 and to some\ngoods, like wealth, more obviously than others \u2014 but it need not\nin principle be confined to such goods, although the examples\nAristotle provides suggest such applications. Similarly, justice in\nrectification involves a sort of \u201carithmetical\nproportion.\u201d If C defrauds D by amount X, then justice requires\ndepriving C of X and restoring X to D, as a matter of reestablishing a\nkind of equality between them. These structural devices are elegant\nand attractive, but they leave open a number of questions (LeBar,\nforthcoming). First, as indicated, to what are we to suppose they\napply? Second, in what way do they figure into the nature of the\nperson who is just in the particular sense? (That is, how are they\nrelated to justice as a virtue?) Does a model of particular justice as\na virtue fit the general model of virtue as a mean, and if so, what\nsort of mean is it? Aristotle seems torn between a conception of\njustice as a virtue in his distinctive understanding of what a virtue\nis \u2014 with a requirement that one have all the virtues to have\nany (Nicomachean EthicsVI.13), and rooted in the doctrine of\nthe mean \u2014 and justice as having the form of a formal normative\nstructure, to which the virtue threatens to become subsidiary. All\nthis is to leave aside questions of the relation between this\n\u201cparticular\u201d sense of justice and political justice, and\nthe role of the virtue of justice in the individual as it contributes\nto justice in the polis.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 conception of the role of justice was more central to\nhis eudaimonism perhaps than its counterpart in Plato and Aristotle,\nbut that reflects in part his distinctive understanding of\neudaimonia, or happiness. For Epicurus this consisted in\nataraxia \u2014 tranquility, or freedom from disturbance.\nGiven that the good life is the life without disturbance, justice\nplays a key instrumental role. One might, Epicurus thinks, withdraw\nentirely from human society to avoid disturbance, but the alternative\nis to live socially under terms which secure the avoidance of\ndisturbance. This is the structure of the ideal Epicurean community,\nin which each forbears aggression (Armstrong 1997, Thrasher 2013).\nJustice is a matter of keeping agreements generally, and in particular\nthe agreement not to harm or transgress social norms.\n\nIn this way Epicurus offers a conception of the virtue of justice that\nharmonizes both its personal and its political dimensions. The\npersonal virtue consists in the motivation to abide by a contract not\nto aggress or harm others. The political virtue inheres in a polity in\nwhich such norms regulate the conduct of its citizens, and these two\ndimensions of justice as a virtue reinforce each other.\n\nThe other great ethical tradition of antiquity (Stoicism) had\nremarkably little to say about justice (Annas 1993, p. 311), so we\npass on to the medieval and modern periods.\n1.2 Medieval and Modern\n\nThe legacy of the ancients \u2014 Aristotle in particular \u2014\ncontinued into the medieval period, notably in the work of Thomas\nAquinas, who appropriated much of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy while\nsetting it into a Christian theological framework. As in Aristotle,\nvirtue and virtues are prominent parts of his ethical theory. And,\nlike Aristotle justice is an important virtue, though for Aquinas it\nless important than the virtue of charity, a Christian virtue that did\nnot appear among the virtues recognized by Aristotle. There are other\nelements of his account that situate it in an interesting way in the\ntransition from ancient eudaimonist accounts of virtue, to virtue as\nit appears in the modern era, before it recedes from prominence in\nethical theory.\n\nBut to the extent Christian writers allied themselves with Plato and\nAristotle, they were downplaying another central element in Christian\nthought and morality, the emphasis on agapic love. Such love seems to\nbe a matter of motivationally active feeling rather than of being\nrational, and some writers on morality (eventually) allowed this side\nof Christianity to have a major influence on what they had to say\nabout virtue.\n\nSignificant elements of the Aristotelian account of justice reappear\nin Aquinas\u2019. First, justice is first and foremost a virtue of\ncharacter rather than institutions, although Aquinas draws a\ndistinction among such virtues not found in Aristotle. For Aquinas,\njustice as a virtue is a matter of perfection of the will, rather than\nthe passions (ST II-II 58.4). Aquinas offers no account of justice as\na virtue of societies or institutions, though he interprets the\n\u201cgeneral\u201d sense of justice he borrows from Aristotle as being a\nmatter of individual willing and action for the common good.\n\u201cParticular\u201d justice, which as in Aristotle\u2019s account is most of\nhis focus, has to do with relationships -- in particular but not\nlimited to exchange -- between individuals as individuals (ST II-II\n58.8). \n\nSecond, Aquinas grounds the norms for these exchanges in the ancient\nformula of Justinian, which hearkens back to Plato: justice is giving\neach his own. But his interpretation of this formula situates him\nastride a deep but subtle divide between ancient and modern thought.\nTo some extent this effect is an upshot of his inheriting not only the\nGreek eudaimonist tradition, but also a Roman jurisprudential\ntradition in which notions like standing and right as claim (rather\nthan, say, fairness) had begun to emerge (Porter 2016, p. 143). As a\nresult, Aquinas\u2019 synergistic account has some novel\ncomplications.\n\nOne major complication, relative to the ancient accounts, is that what\nis ours by right is a recognition of a kind of status, as an effect of\nthe order among people ordained by God (ST I-II 100.8). As\nJean Porter points out, this establishes a normative standard for\njustice that does not grow out of the agent\u2019s own perfection or\neudaimonia (Porter 2016, p. 157). There are two significant follow-on\nimplications.\n\nFirst, the fabric of the eudaimonist approach to practical reasoning\nand life \u2014 inherited from the Greeks \u2014 begins to fray. For\nbetter or worse, on the Greek eudaimonist views (including here Plato,\nAristotle, the Stoics, and Epicurus) our reasons for action arise from\nour interest in a happy life. If the reason-giving nature of others\narises from a different source, as this reading of Aquinas suggests,\nthen practical reason seems to have a duality of ultimate sources,\nwith the complications that kind of duality brings.\n\nSecond, this is the first step in the diminution of the theoretical\nsignificance of the virtues \u2014 a process that will not begin to\nbe reversed until the middle of the 20th century. On Aristotle\u2019s\nview, for example, the virtuous person sees reasons for acting that\nthe non-virtuous do not (and that arguably are not there to be seen\nabsent the effects of virtue \u2014 LeBar 2013; Berryman 2019).\nVirtue is no longer the normative epicenter of the theory, as it was\nfor the Greeks. To the extent that this aspect of Aquinas\u2019s view has\nvirtue responsive to value or reasons that is accounted for in some\nway other than the work of virtue, it is the leading edge of process\nthat will result in a much-reduced role for virtue in later ethical\naccounts\n\nHume is an excellent exemplar of this point, in both the\nTreatise and the Enquiries. Virtue, Hume maintains,\nis a matter of \u201csome quality or character,\u201d produced in one by\n\u201cdurable principles of the mind\u201d (T III.iii.I, p. 575).\nWe deem such qualities virtues not, as on the ancient Greek view,\nbecause they conduce to the happiness of the person who has them, but\nbecause they have a \u201ctendency to the good of mankind\u201d or society.\n(T III.iii.I). This service renders them pleasing to our\n\u201cmoral tastes:\u201d our approbation, Hume tells us, has its source in\n\u201cview of a character, which is naturally fitted to be useful to\nothers, or to the person himself, or which is agreeable to others, or\nto the person himself\u201d (T III.iii.I, 591). We can think of\nthat as the criterion some quality of character must have to be deemed\na virtue. In consequence, what counts as virtuous is an upshot of, and\nnot the source of, the normative foundations of this view.\n\nBy Hume\u2019s time the content of justice as a virtue has\nshifted as well. In Hume\u2019s treatment, the focus of justice is\nproperty \u2014 relations of \u201cmine and thine.\u201d It is a\n\u201ccautious, jealous\u201d virtue in the sense that it is focused on the\nsorts of exclusionary powers that are characteristic of property rules\nand relations. We may always be aspiring for more but justice aims at\nthe preservation and security of what one has already (E\nIII.1, p. 184). So the virtue of justice, as Hume thinks of it, will\nin the main consist of a quality in one which disposes one to observe\nand uphold these rules. \n\nWhat Hume wants to show is, first, that we can have such a disposition\nor quality (that is, that it is possible for us to have a quality or\ncharacter to observe the rules of justice), and, second, that such a\nquality would count as a virtue, given his criteria. His approach to\nthese questions in the Treatise is framed by a problem he has\nset up himself. To appreciate that problem, we have to step back to\nHume\u2019s broader view about moral motivation. Hume had argued that\nmoral principles \u201care not conclusions of our reason\u201d (T\nIII.i.I); instead, they are \u201cmore properly felt than judg\u2019d of\u201d\n(T III.i.II). Morality, and virtue, is a matter of sentiments\nor passions. Why? Hume marshals a number of arguments to this effect\nwhich are not relevant to our purposes. The basic reason is that the\nfunctional roles of reason and the passions are markedly different, in\nHume\u2019s view. The task of reason is to discover truth or falsehood,\nin \u201crelations of ideas\u201d or \u201cmatters of facts\u201d (T\nIII.i.I); as such, it utterly lacks the capacity to move us to action.\nOnly the passions can do that (T II.iii.III). The passions,\non the other hand, have no representational content whatsoever; they\nare \u201coriginal existences\u201d (T II.iii.III; III.i.I). Virtue\nis paradigmatically a practical matter: it is a property of what we\ndo, and to act we must be motivated. That means any successful account\nof virtue must find it in our passions, not in any aspect of our\nreason (T III.i.I). So far so good.\n\nHowever, when we come to justice, we look in vain for a passion that\ncan supply motive power for us to act justly. If anything, our natural\nmotives move us away from justice (T III.ii.II). Self-love\nrequires \u201ccorrecting and restraining\u201d (T III.ii.I). And\nonly a passion can do that. But which? Hume himself dismisses the\npossibilities of public or private beneficence or universal love. In\nthe end he concludes that there is no natural passion to explain it.\nInstead, it is in a certain crucial sense artificial (T\nIII.ii.VI). Under certain conditions, given that we are sensible of\nthe advantages of living in human society, our self-love or\nself-interest may be given an \u201calteration of its direction,\u201d and\ninduce us to respect the rules of justice. These Hume thinks of\nprimarily as involving honesty and \u201cparticular\u201d property\nrules (T III.ii.II). That \u201calteration\u201d needs\nexplanation.\n\nTwo facts about the conditions in which we act \u2014 one about us,\none about our environment \u2014 set this alteration in motion.\nFirst, Hume maintains, we are limited in our generosity or\nbenevolence. And second, we live in conditions of scarcity (T\nIII.ii.II). We have to work to make a go of it, and we cannot count on\nothers to do so for us. We need control of our world to meet our\nneeds, but we are vulnerable to the selfishness and predation of\nothers.\n\nThe solution, Hume argues, is that we naturally fall into a\n\u201cconvention\u201d by which we observe that rules of property \u2014\nthe observance of which is key to the virtue of justice \u2014 is\ngood for all of us. This convention is no formal agreement; Hume\nargues that it cannot be something like the product of promise or\ncompact (T III.ii.II). Instead, \u201cit arises gradually, and\nacquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience\nof the inconveniences of transgressing it\u201d (T III.ii.II, p.\n490). Much as two men pulling the oars in a boat together need no\nexplicit agreement to find they prosper by such an arrangement, so do\nwe generally. (Wilson 2018 explores support for Hume\u2019s\nhypothesis through work in experimental economics.) So in the end it\nis self-interest that drives us to comply with the requirements of\njustice, though Hume adds that sympathy with the public interest\ninduces our endorsement of it once justice has become established.\nThis endorsement, however, is reserved for a scheme of property rules\ntaken generally; as Hume observes, individual instances of compliance\nmay frequently be \u201ccontrary to public interest,\u201d though such\ncompliance is still required of us. Hume believes the benefit of the\nsystem overall, both to society and to individual, requires that rules\nnot admit of exceptions (T III.ii.II, E Appendix\nIII, \u00a7256). Self-interest accounts for the possibility of our being\nmotivated to act as the virtue of justice requires, and both the\nutility and the agreeableness, both to ourselves and others, of a\nresulting social order with respected property rules, leads to our\napprobation of that motivation as a virtue. \n\nIn fact, this point \u2014 that \u201cpublic utility is the sole origin\nof justice\u201d \u2014 is the point of Hume\u2019s discussion of justice\nin the Enquiries (III.I, \u00b6145). Scarcity imposes a need for\nus to distinguish mine from thine, and we have not sufficient\ngenerosity in our natures to do without property rules (as we might,\nsay, in our families). And once again Hume argues that our recognition\nof the utility and necessity of justice provides \u201centire command\nover our sentiments\u201d (E III.II, \u00b6163).As David Johnston\nobserves (Johnston 2011, p. 138), Hume\u2019s understanding of the\nvalue of justice as instrumental in the promotion of utility marks a\nsharp shift from earlier understandings which invoked various forms of\nreciprocity in understanding that value.\n\nSuch a sentimentalist account of justice is also found in Adam Smith;\nin fact, a focus on the sentiments almost completely swamps concern\nfor virtue. Our judgments of virtue and vice, he says, are compounded\nby consideration of two different \u201crelations\u201d in a sentiment:\n\u201cthe cause or object which excites or causes it, and \u2026 the end\nwhich it proposes\u201d (TMS II.i.introduction). His focus on those two\n\u201crelations\u201d obviates any independent discussion of virtue per se.\nHe does however explicitly countenance a virtue of justice, developed\nin contrast with the virtue of beneficence. In Smith, even more\nclearly than in Hume, one can see that this virtue consists in\nconformity to \u201crules\u201d or \u201claws\u201d of justice that appear to\nexist antecedently to the realization of the virtue itself, unlike\nancient accounts. Smith indicates that justice merits resentment when\nabsent, that it may be \u201cextorted by force,\u201d and that in the main\nit requires forbearing from harming others.. Smith calls justice a\n\u201cnegative virtue\u201d in this respect: often all it requires is that\nwe sit still and do nothing (Smith 1759, II.ii.I.5, 9). It is\nessential to the subsistence of society, Smith tells us (Smith 1759,\nII.ii.3.3-4), but \u2014 in contrast to Hume \u2014 is not reducible\nin its motivational basis to regard for society. Instead, our just\nconcern for \u201cmultitudes\u201d is compounded of our concern for\nindividuals, which arises from \u201cfellow-feeling,\u201d which is yet\nshort of \u201clove, esteem, and affection\u201d (Smith 1759, II.ii.3.7).\n\n\nIn Kant, finally, along with a movement away from sentimentalism we\nsee the completion of the distinction between justice as a virtue and\njustice as a norm to which a virtue may or may not correspond. While\nKant has a theory (or \u201cdoctrine\u201d) of virtue, he distinguishes that\ntheory precisely against a counterpoised theory of justice. The two\nare complementary elements in the \u201cmetaphysics of morals.\u201d\nMoreover, the doctrine of justice itself has two parts, roughly\ncorresponding to the distinction present since Plato\u2019s work, between\nthe role of justice in the individual and the role of justice in the\nstate. Kant calls these \u201cprivate right\u201d and \u201cpublic right,\u201d\nrespectively. But right in either case is not how Kant at least\nconceives of virtue; instead, right is a \u201ccondition\u201d that can\nobtain between the moral agents comprising a moral or legal community,\nin virtue of their principles of choice in acting (Kant 1797). Little\nremains here of the notion of justice as a virtue of individuals as it\nbegan with the ancient Greeks.\n2. Social Psychology and Justice\n\n20th-century developmental psychology drew deeply on the Kantian\nlegacy. Piaget (1932/1948) treated moral development as principally\ninvolving increasing cognitive sophistication. More particularly,\nPiaget saw that sophistication as a matter of taking more and more\ngeneral or universal views of moral issues, and endorsed the Kantian\nand rationalist idea that morality rests on and can be justified in\nterms of considerations of justice. Piaget saw a \u201claw of\nevolution\u201d in moral development, from an understanding of rules\n(including moral rules) as being \u201cheteronomous\u201d\nimpositions of authority, to which one is objectively responsible, to\na grounding in mutual respect, accompanied by subjective\nresponsibility to others (Piaget 1932/1948, p. 225). This transition\nis fostered through social interaction, and attention to norms of\nequality and reciprocity replace those of mere obedience.\n\nEducational psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg was inspired by Piaget to\npropose a conception of moral development that postulated six stages\nof human moral development. In his earliest work, Kohlberg identified\nthe highest stage of such development with a concern for justice and\nhuman rights based on universal principles. Concern for relationships\nand for individual human well-being was embedded in a framework of\nconformity to social norms, at lower stages of the process. Moreover,\nhe saw the ordering of the different stages in Piagetian fashion as\nbasically reflecting differences in rational understanding: those\nwhose moral thinking involved the invoking of universal principles of\njustice and rights were thought to show a more advanced cognitive\ndevelopment than those whose moral thought appeals primarily to the\nimportance of relationships and of human well-being or suffering. The\nparadigm of moral development involves judgments that are\n\u201creversible,\u201d in the sense that each party to the issue\ncan accept the correct judgment by reversing his or her perspective\nand taking up the viewpoint of the other (Kohlberg 1981). The\nsophisticated moral reasoner will engage in a process of \u201cmoral\nmusical chairs,\u201d taking up the positions of the parties to the\nconflict successively. It is, on this version of Kohlberg\u2019s\nthought, that formal feature of the deliberative process that is\ncharacteristic of greatest moral development. As his research and\nthought progressed, however, Kohlberg increasingly acknowledged that\nthese formal features were less characteristic of overall moral\ndevelopment and thought than of the deployment of specifically\njustice-based concepts. In fact, Kohlberg was impressed by the work of\nRawls, and thought that the nature of Rawls\u2019 \u201coriginal\nposition of equality\u201d exemplified the kind of reversibility that\nis paradigmatic of the highest form of moral thought (Kohlberg 1981,\np. 204). However, his approach treats utilitarianism as less\ncognitively advanced (more primitive) than rationalist views like\nKant\u2019s, and utilitarians (like R.M. Hare) naturally called into\nquestion the objectivity and intellectual fairness of Kohlberg\u2019s\naccount. \n\nMore significantly, perhaps, the evidence for Kohlberg\u2019s stage\nsequence was drawn from studies of boys, and when one applies the\nsequence to the study of young girls, it turns out that girls on\naverage end up at a less advanced stage of moral development than boys\ndo. In her 1982 book In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory\nand Women\u2019s Development, Carol Gilligan responded to\nKohlberg\u2019s views by questioning whether a theory of moral\ndevelopment based solely on a sample of males could reasonably be used\nto draw conclusions about the inferior moral development of women.\nGilligan argued that her own studies of women\u2019s development\nindicated that the moral development of girls and women proceeds and\nends in a different fashion from that of boys and men, but that that\nproves nothing about inferiority or superiority: it is merely a fact\nof difference. In particular, Gilligan claimed that women tend to\nthink morally in terms of connection to others (relationships) and in\nterms of caring about (responsibility for) those with whom they are\nconnected; men, by contrast and in line with Kohlberg\u2019s studies,\ntend to think more in terms of general principles of justice and of\nindividual rights against (or individual autonomy from) other people.\nBut Jean Hampton, among others, responded that Gilligan\u2019s\ncritique was itself a distortion, and that concerns for justice and\nindividual rights are as significant for and in the moral lives of\nwomen as for men (Hampton 1993).\n\nIn recent years, a variety of social sciences have intensified\ninvestigation into aspects of our natures that are plausibly important\nfor a virtue of justice. For example, Widlok 2018 surveys\ncross-cultural anthropological work examining the development of\n\u201cethical skill\u201d in rightful and just sharing practices.\n3. Justice as a Virtue of Societies\n\nFor a variety of reasons, many ethical thinkers have thought that\njustice cannot be based in sentiment but requires a more\nintellectually constructive rational(ist) basis, and in recent times\nthis view of the matter seems to have been held, most influentially,\nby John Rawls in A Theory of Justice. Rawls makes clear his\nbelief in the inadequacy of benevolence or sympathetic human sentiment\nin formulating an adequate conception of social justice. He says in\nparticular that sentiment leaves unanswered or indeterminate various\nimportant issues of justice that a good theory of justice ought to be\nable to resolve.\n\nRawls\u2019s positive view of justice is concerned primarily with the\njustice of institutions or (what he calls) the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society: justice as an individual virtue is\nderivative from justice as a social virtue defined via certain\nprinciples of justice. The principles, famously, are derived from an\n\u201coriginal position\u201d in which (very roughly) rational\ncontractors under a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d decide how they\nwish to commit themselves to being governed in their actual lives.\nRawls deliberately invokes Kantian rationalism (or\nanti-sentimentalism) in explaining the intellectual or theoretical\nmotivation behind his construction, and the two principles of justice\nthat he argues would be agreed upon under the contractual conditions\nhe specifies represent a kind of egalitarian political liberalism.\nRoughly, those principles stress (equality of) basic liberties and\nopportunities for self-advancement over considerations of social\nwelfare, and the distribution of opportunities and goods in society is\nthen supposed to work to the advantage of all (especially the\nworst-off members of society). He also says that the idea of what\npeople distributively deserve or merit is derivative from social\njustice rather than (as with Aristotle and/or much common-sense\nthinking) providing the basis for thinking about social justice.\n\nAccording to Rawls, individual justice is theoretically derivative\nfrom social justice because the just individual is to be understood as\nsomeone with an effective or \u201cregulative\u201d desire to comply\nwith the principles of justice. However, it is not merely social\njustice that Rawls understands in (predominantly) rationalist fashion.\nWhen he explains how individuals (within a just society) develop a\nsense and/or the virtue of justice, he invokes the work of Piaget.\nRawls lays more stress than Piaget does on the role our affective\nnature (sympathy and the desire for self-mastery) plays in the\nacquisition of moral virtue. But, like Piaget, he stresses the need\nfor a sufficiently general appreciation and rational\nunderstanding of social relations as the grounding basis of a\nsense of duty or of justice and he explicitly classifies his account\nof moral development as falling within the \u201crationalist\ntradition.\u201d \n4. Justice and Other Virtues\n\nFew would doubt that justice is a virtue of character. But there are\nother moral virtues. How is justice related to them? Is it more\nimportant? Even in Republic, in which Plato makes justice a\n\u201cmaster virtue\u201d of sorts, there are other virtues (wisdom,\ncourage, and self-discipline), and elsewhere (notably\nGorgias) Plato makes self-discipline (sophrosune)\nthe \u201cmaster virtue,\u201d so it is not clear that justice has any sort\nof priority over these other virtues. Likewise, though the texts we\nhave show Aristotle devoting more space to justice, it is not clear\nthat the particular form of the virtue of justice has any sort of\npre-eminence. On the other hand, Cicero claims that justice is the\n\u201ccrowning glory\u201d of the virtues (De Officiis I.7). If we\ntake virtue of character to have the moral centrality the ancients\n(perhaps in contrast to the moderns), how much importance should we\naccord to justice among the virtues?\n\nAquinas cites Cicero as a target in developing a sophisticated view of\nthe relationships among the virtues (ST II-II 58.12). On\nAquinas\u2019 view, Cicero is half right, for Aquinas distinguishes\nbetween virtues as responsive to appetites of our animal nature (moral\nvirtues) and as responsive to appetites of our intellect (virtues of\nthe will). He takes it that justice is preeminent over the moral\nvirtues because it inheres in the rational part of the soul, and\nbecause its object is more noble (the good of others, or the common\ngood, rather than the individual good). On that point he can agree\nwith Cicero. However, these virtues themselves are not as excellent as\nthe theological virtues, of which the greatest is love (or charity --\ncaritas; ST II-II 23.6). There are several arguments for this\nclaim but it is grounded in Paul\u2019s admonition to the Corinthians,\nthat love is the greatest among the virtues of faith and hope (1\nCorinthians 13:13).\n\nIn recent decades there have been secular challenges to the primacy of\njustice among virtues. Recall that Carol Gilligan had argued for a\n\u201cdifferent voice\u201d for women in coming to grips with moral\nproblems. Instead of a rights-based understanding of morality that\ngave special consideration to the individual, women saw relationships\nbetween people as primary (Gilligan 1983, pp. 19, 29). Kohlberg had\noffered a thought experiment about a man (\u201cHeinz\u201d) tempted to\nsteal a life-saving drug to save his sick wife (Kohlberg 1981, p. 12).\nWhereas boys are more likely to think of Heinz\u2019 dilemma in terms of\nwhat is the right thing to do, girls, Gilligan argues, see the world\nas \u201ca world of relationships and psychological truths where an\nawareness of the connection between people gives rise to a recognition\nof responsibility for one another\u201d (Gillian 1983, p. 30). Gilligan\ncarefully frames this contrast as one between voices, not a matter of\nranking of dispositions or virtues, but her work can and did provide a\nbasis for making that sort of assessment between virtues, one on which\n(as in Aquinas\u2019 case) love and care for others turns out to be more\nimportant than considerations of justice.\n\nIn some ways, Nel Nodding\u2019s pioneering work in laying out an\n\u201cethic of care\u201d takes such a step. Following Gilligan, she sees\nmuch ethical theory as missing a feminine voice, one which grounds\nmoral concern for the concrete other in caring for them and their\nneeds, and thus as relational rather than individualistic (Noddings\n1983, 1999). Yet some caution is required before seeing her as taking\nup something like a Thomistic stance on the priority of love over\njustice. For one thing, to a significant degree she wants to emphasize\nthe importance of the concrete and particular as opposed to the\nabstract and general (or the reliance on universal principles) in\nthinking and acting morally. But that is an emphasis which animates\nsome particularistic forms of virtue ethics, and does not distinguish\njustice from love or other virtues. Moreover, where she explicitly\nargues that care \u201c\u2018picks up\u2019 where justice leaves off\u201d\n(Noddings 1999, p. 12), she is thinking of justice as a property of\ninstitutions (e.g. Rawls\u2019 theory of justice as fairness), and\ninstitutional implementations of those theories, not a virtue of\ncharacter. She is clearly concerned about the limits of\n\u201crights-talk,\u201d but that at least historically has not been a\nprominent part in thinking about justice as a virtue of character.\nThus she does not clearly take a side in this matter.\n\nLike Noddings, Virginia Held frames much of the point of the ethics of\ncare against a historical theoretical backdrop of attention to justice\n(Held 1995, 2004, 2006). To some extent, like Noddings, for Held the\nrelevant notion of justice is not a virtue of character but a concern\nwith fairness, equality, and individual rights, or perhaps more\ngenerally impartial universal principles (Held 2004, p. 144; 2006, p.\n14). In fact, Held more clearly poses an ethics of care as an\nalternative to virtue ethics (Held 2004, 143; 2006, 14). This is for\ntwo reasons. First, virtue ethical theories focus on dispositions and\ntraits of individuals, whereas an ethics of care focuses on relations\nbetween individuals. Second, an ethics of care sees people as\npartially constituted by their relations with others, as opposed to\nthe individualism characteristic of virtue ethics. Held does not think\nan ethics of care can do without a concern for justice as a value,\nhowever (Held 1995, 129). More generally, she believes, caring\nprovides a \u201cwider network\u201d within which concerns for justice and\nvirtue (as well as utility) should be fitted (2004, 147; 2006, 72).\nMargaret McLaren (2001), on the other hand, responds on the basis of\ncommonalities between care ethics and virtue ethics that care ethics\nactually is most attractive when situated as an ethics of virtue.\nMarilyn Friedman (1987) similarly seems accepting of the general\nframework of virtue ethics, and of crucial places for virtues of both\ncaring and justice within such a framework, responsive to different\ndegrees and in different ways to gender differences she believes\nactually do hold, though not falling along a caring/justice fault\nline.\n\nMichael Slote also accepts care ethics as well-situated as a virtue\nethical theory, but argues for the necessity of conceiving such a\ntheory as \u201cagent-based\u201d -- holding that motivation or motives are\n\u201cthe ultimate bases for evaluation of action, institutions, laws,\nand societies\u201d (Slote 1998, p. 173). As he has developed his view,\nempathic motivation has come to take an increasing role (Slote 2010,\np. 124). As with Noddings and Held, for Slote the relevant questions\nabout justice are about forms of social organization, the allocation\nof rights, and so on. If there is a vestige of the Platonic/Justinian\nmodel of justice as a virtue, it would appear to figure in only as a\nrationale for the shape of some social policies reflecting e.g. social\n(or perhaps global) distributive justice. But empathy is the focal\nnormative concern throughout. The justice of a society constitutively\ndepends on the motives of the individuals who make it up (Slote 1998,\np. 187; 2010, p. 128). If the relevant motives are caring or empathic\nones, then Slote\u2019s analysis would seem to collapse the distinction\nbetween caring and justice as virtues of individual character (or\nmotivation). That is, individuals would count as just exactly to the\ndegree that their motivations are empathic, and they thus contribute\nto the laws, policies, institutions, and so on in ways that are\nreflective of similar motivations across society. But that is just to\nsay that they are caring motivations as well.\n\nA somewhat different feminist critique of a focus on a virtue of\njustice comes from Robin Dillon. Like Slote, her concern is more with\nsocial institutions, structures, and hierarchies than with traits of\ncharacter, and in fact these priorities lead her to be critical of\nvirtue ethical theories which, she believes, cannot ask the right\nquestions about virtues and vices (Dillon 2012, p. 86). However, she\ndoes accept the point that character traits matter, though she\nbelieves attending to the vices that allow and support social\nstructures that allow for oppression and domination is more pertinent\nto feminist moral philosophy.\n\nLisa Tessman, on the other hand, accepts the basic framework of\nAristotelian thinking about virtues of character, and with it the\nvirtue of justice (Tessman 2005). However, she argues that oppressive\nsocial conditions can interfere in ways Aristotle did not anticipate\nwith the formation of virtues of character and consequently (given\nAristotle\u2019s framework) with prospects for happiness (eudaimonia).\nOne point of amendment, then, to Aristotelian thought is to recognize\nthat oppressive social conditions may make other traits \u2014 traits\nthat are important for liberatory struggle \u2014 into virtues.\nAnother, congruent with other lines of feminist critique, is that\nAristotle is insufficiently appreciative of the need for sensitivity\nto and response to suffering, so that something like the kind of\nsupplementation recommended by care ethics is appropriate. A different\nmodel of response to the development of the virtue of justice\nspecifically under non-ideal or unjust social conditions, one modeled\non Kohlberg\u2019s original architectonic understanding of the virtue, is\ndefended by Jon Garthoff (Garthoff 2018). \n\nFinally, in recent work Talbot Brewer has argued that a\n\u201crevisionist\u201d version of Aristotelian virtue ethics does a better\njob than competitors (including Kantian and contractualist theories)\nat recognizing the \u201cirreplaceable value\u201d of each human being\n(Brewer 2018). Brewer believes that a robust conception of the virtue\nof justice does important work for such a theory, not just focusing on\ndistribution and allocation, but more generally establishing the space\nfor virtuous recognition of ways that others can demand that we treat\nthem (Brewer 2018, p. 25). Still, Brewer invokes Aquinas to argue that\nsuch justice is not enough, that that what is required is a\nrecognition of a virtue of love to unify and perfect the other virtues\nof character.\n5. Recent Developments\n\nWhile Rawls\u2019 work has sparked an explosion of work in\ndistributive justice and social justice more generally, in recent\nyears a variety of strategies to return to a focus on justice as a\npersonal virtue has emerged. These strategies vary across both\ndimensions we have considered, taking with various degrees of\nseriousness the connection between institutional and personal forms of\njustice, and focusing on the latter as a virtue, among (and like)\nother virtues.\n\nOne such strategy is that of Jon Drydyk, who builds on the\n\u201ccapability approach\u201d to human welfare to make a case for\na capabilities-based account of the justice of individual agents, in\nparticular as against an \u201cAristotelian\u201d approach that\nstresses justice as a matter of response to merit. Acting justly\ninvolves \u201cstriving to reduce and remove inequalities in\npeople\u2019s capabilities to function in ways that are\nelemental\u201d to a truly human life (Drydyk 2012, pp. 31, 33). This\nis a \u201csubsidiary\u201d virtue account, in that we begin with a\nprior conception of the content of the requirements of justice, and\nconform the virtue to this conception. However, Drydyk emphasizes\njustice as a virtue of individuals, rather than institutions or\nsocieties. Drydyk\u2019s strategy offers a counterpoint both to the\nRawlsian way of thinking about just societies and to the ancient Greek\nway of thinking about justice as a virtue of individuals.\n\nJohn Hacker-Wright argues that what is needed to replace a\n\u201clegalistic\u201d concern with moral status (as on modern\nliberal conceptions of justice) is instead an ethic of virtue with a\ndifferent conception of the virtue of justice. Instead of a concern\nfor the resolution of claims in something like reciprocal, contractual\nrelations, Hacker-Wright\u2019s conception of the virtue of justice\nis a matter of sensitivity to \u201cvulnerability of value\u201d in\nthings, animate and otherwise. Thus, the threat of unjust \u2014\nvicious -- wronging hangs not only over people who are sufficiently\ncognitively impaired so as not to perceive insults, but also corpses,\nanimals, and even rare and valuable rock formations (p. 463). This\ncounts as a sense of justice in that, on Hacker-Wright\u2019s view it\nis not merely that we can act wrongly or viciously toward such\nentities, but (following Midgley 1983) that they can be wronged by us\nby our doing so. However, while Hacker-Wright claims that on a virtue\nethic \u201cThe character of the agent is recognized as ineliminable\nin picking out facts as they figure in our moral deliberation,\u201d\nthis does not strictly speaking seem to be true, as prior to virtue\nthere is value which it is up to the just or virtuous person\nto respond with sensitivity (Hacker-Wright 2007, pp. 461, 463,\n464).\n\nDavid Schmidtz and John Thrasher suggest rethinking the relationship\nbetween social justice and individual justice (Schmidtz and Thrasher\n2014). Turning Plato\u2019s account of justice in Republic\non its head, they depict justice as a bridge between a virtue of the\nsoul and of the polis: because we are essentially social, we\nneed community, and justice is a matter of harmony with the community.\nOn their view this is (largely) a matter of compliance with rules and\ninstitutions that enable people to live in harmony and flourish\ntogether.\n\nAn alternative proposal for thinking of the justice as a personal\nvirtue ties it intimately to the experiences we have as emotional\ncreatures. On this approach, instead of justice standing as distinct\nfrom \u201cnatural virtues\u201d motivated by passions (as on\nHume\u2019s account), or needing to be replaced by\nsentimentally-driven attitudes such as care or compassion, justice is\nto be seen as a virtue largely constituted by emotion\n(Solomon 1994, Roberts 2010). The virtue amounts to a stable\ndisposition of character to respond in the relevant ways to instances\nof injustice, perhaps consisting in those occasions in which one does\nnot receive his or her due, and on the other hand to be disposed to a\n\u201cwill to give each his due\u201d (Roberts 2010, p. 38). For\nRoberts, this is a will to realize \u201cobjective justice,\u201d\nand as on other recent accounts, the virtue (and the passion) are\ntheoretically subsidiary to this primary notion of \u201cobjective\njustice.\u201d\n\nThere are also recent ventures in the spirit of the ancient Greek\nthinking about the individual virtue of justice. Rasmussen and Den Uyl\n(2005) argue for two interpersonal senses of justice (pp. 160-63). One\nis the familiar Aristotelian virtue. The second is a\n\u201cmetanormative\u201d principle governing the institutions and\nlegal frameworks in which individual agents (just and otherwise) live\ntheir lives and exercise their practical agency. The second of these\nsenses of interpersonal justice does not draw its content from the\nexercise of virtue, but rather makes a place for it. The former does\ndepend on virtue overall (including the exercise of practical wisdom)\nfor its demands, but these are construed broadly in the traditional\nway of rendering to each his due. Bloomfield (2011) similarly suggests\nextending the Aristotelian virtue of justice, but in an inward\ndirection, arguing that self-respect is necessary for happiness, and\ntreating oneself fairly requires treating oneself fairly, as one\ntreats others fairly, as a property of justice as individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolterstorff (2008) argues that the eudaimonism of\nGreek thought prevents a proper appreciation for the nature and\nsignificance of justice and rights. Whether there is theoretical space\nremaining for a virtue of justice is not a question Wolterstorff\nconsiders, but he does believe there is no hope for an adequate grip\non justice in an Aristotelian or Stoic framework. \n\nRecent thinkers have grappled with the question of priority between\nformal principle and virtue that vexed Aristotle, and offered\nsolutions that for the most part subordinate the virtue of justice to\nthe prior notion of the justice of distributions, as Aristotle himself\nseems to have suggested. Bernard Williams claims explicitly that this\nis so (Williams 1980, p. 197), as does David Wiggins, in an attempt to\nbring a \u201cpre-liberal,\u201d Aristotelian conception of justice\nto bear on modern liberal conceptions, a la Kant and Rawls (Wiggins\n2004). To do so, Wiggins distinguishes three senses of justice: (A) a\nmatter of outcomes or states of affairs in which each gets what is\ndue; (B) a disposition to promote justice (A); (C) a condition of the\npolis in virtue of which (A) is realized. Wiggins claims that the\nproper outcome of this collision of conceptions is one that recognizes\na form of logical priority of justice (A) over justice (B)\n(p. 489). At the same time, against Williams he insists that the\nnormative demands of justice (A) are \u201ccomprehensible\u201d only\nwithin the perspective of a person with justice (B). And in fact he\nclaims that a necessary condition on acts and outcomes satisfying the\nnorms of justice (A) is that they be recognized to be so by those with\nthe virtue of justice (B). Wiggins\u2019 thinking here is not\ntransparent, but perhaps the thought is that the logical point is\npurely formal: someone with justice (B) must, in act or judging\njustly, be responding to some norm which counts as justice (A). But,\nas merely formal, that tells us nothing about the substantive\ncontent of that norm. To get that, we have ineliminable need to refer\nto the judgment of the person with justice (B). That marks a way\nperhaps of restoring Aristotle\u2019s focus on virtue in coming to\nunderstand the virtue of justice. \n\nLeBar (2013, 2014) takes a similar tack in attempting to incorporate\nKantian and post-Kantian insights into just demands on the treatment\nof others into an Aristotelian virtue framework. On his view, there is\nno way to specify the contents of the demands of justice, or to spell\nout its norms, independently of the wider possession and exercise of\nthe virtues, including the virtue of practical wisdom. At the same\ntime, what the virtuous and just person sees, in inhabiting a social\nworld with equals in moral standing, are the norms which have become\nassociated with the liberal conception: the standing to obligate\nothers and hold them accountable, for example.\n\nFinally, all of these are Western treatments of an individual virtue\nof justice. May Sim (Sim 2007, 2018) makes the case that there are\ninformative parallels between the Confucian treatment of the virtues\n(in particular, yi) and the virtue of justice as adumbrated in Plato\nand Aristotle. \n6. Conclusion\n\nThere are many different conceptions of the virtue of justice, and\nonly some of them are distinctively virtue ethical. Many non-virtual\nethical approaches put forward theories of virtue, and what\ndistinguishes them from virtue ethics is that the given theory of\nvirtue comes later in the order of explanation, rather than itself\nserving as the basis for understanding (all of) morality. This is\nespecially the case with justice, where (as we have seen) it is\nnaturally tempting to account for the norms of justice first\nand derive an account of the virtue in light of those norms.\nThe question of the priority of norms of justice or the virtue of\njustice is likely to continue to generate exploration and debate, as\nis the question of how our lives as social and political animals\ncontributes to understanding the virtue of justice. These vexed\nquestions have inspired a profusion of views and no doubt will\ncontinue to do so. \n",
