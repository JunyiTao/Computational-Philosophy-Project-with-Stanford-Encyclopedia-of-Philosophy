Philosophy of Religion, Philosophical Theology, Christian Theology: Is There A Difference and Does it Matter?\n\nIt might seem odd that analytic philosophy of religion (APR) includes\nexplicitly Christian philosophical theology of the sort discussed in\n Section 2.\n Yet most philosophers of religion working in the analytic tradition\nare Christian theists (Bourget & Chalmers 2014; De Cruz 2017).\nThey avowedly want to explore their faith using analytic philosophical\ntools, and see no problem in calling their work Christian philosophy,\nphilosophical theology, or more recently, \u201canalytic\ntheology\u201d. Of course, philosophy of religion as such is broader\nthan APR, and APR is broader than Christian APR. There are\nphilosophers of religion whose work is analytic but not Christian\n(e.g., Lebens 2020; Mizrahi 2020; Steinhart 2020; Oppy 2018;\nSchellenberg 2018; Draper 2019), Christian but not analytic (e.g.,\nWestphal 2001; Pattison 2011), and neither analytic nor Christian\n(e.g., Hammerschlag 2016; Burley 2016). Even so, the predominance of\nChristian philosophical theology\u2014or \u201cPlantinga-style\nChristian philosophy\u201d (Schellenberg 2018)\u2014within APR has\nrecently reopened some contentious debates about the proper\nrelationship between philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nThese debates can be grouped around two different\u2014and\nopposing\u2014lines of criticism. According to the first line, much\nAPR is too Christian and too theological: not really philosophy at\nall, but a thinly-disguised form of Christian theology\u2014perhaps\neven a form of apologetics (Levine 2000; Knepper 2013: 9; Draper 2019:\n2). Conversely, according to the second line, advanced by prominent\ntheologians, APR is neither fully Christian nor fully theological. On\nthis line of criticism, APR does not really wrestle with the\ntranscendent God of Christian faith, but tends to construct and\nexamine its own false \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d (Milbank\n2009; Hart 2013; Oliver 2010; see also Harris & Insole 2005, 17).\nAlthough mutually opposing, both lines of criticism raise an important\nmethodological question: how\u2014if at all\u2014should we\ndistinguish philosophy about Christian topics from Christian theology?\n Section 1\n (above) surveyed important responses to this question in the history\nof Christian thought. This section addresses the question in the\ncontext of contemporary challenges to analytic philosophy of\nreligion.\n",
