This approach to\nmeaning, known widely as \u201ctruth-conditional semantics\u201d, is\nhistorically associated with\n Donald Davidson\u2019s\n (1967) thesis that the \u201c(T)-sentences\u201d (i.e., the\ninstances of the (T)-schema) generated by a Tarski-truth-definition\nfor a language give the meanings of the sentences they mention, by\nspecifying their truth conditions. In contemporary linguistics, a\nprominent approach to sentence meaning explains it in terms of\npropositions, understood (following Lewis 1970 and Stalnaker 1970) as\nsets of possible worlds, which amount to encapsulations of truth\nconditions (Elbourne 2011, 50\u201351).\n\nThis has led a number of philosophers to argue that, on pain of\ncircularity, deflationism cannot be combined with theories of meaning\nthat make use of the notion of truth to explain meaning \u2013 in\nother words, that deflationism is incompatible with truth-conditional\ntheories of meaning. This assessment of deflationism stems from\nDummett\u2019s (1959 [1978, 7]) claim that the (T)-sentences (or the\ninstances of any other version of (ES)) cannot both tell us what the\nsentences they nominalize mean and give us an account of\n\u2018true\u2019. As Horwich (1998a, 68) puts it, \u201cwe would be\nfaced with something like a single equation and two unknowns\u201d\n(cf. Davidson 1990, 1996; Horwich 1998b, Kalderon 1999, Collins\n2002).\n\nThe first thing to say regarding this objection is that, even if\ndeflationism were inconsistent with truth-conditional theories of\nmeaning, this would not automatically constitute an objection\nto deflationism. After all, there are alternative theories of meaning\navailable, and most deflationists reject truth-conditional semantics\nin favor of some \u201ctruth-free\u201d alternative. The main\nalternatives available include Brandom\u2019s (1994) inferentialism,\ndeveloped following\n Wilfrid Sellars\n (1974, 1979); Horwich\u2019s (1998b) use-theory of meaning, inspired\nby Wittgenstein 1953; and Field\u2019s (1994a, 2001b)\ncomputational-role + indication-relations account. There is, however,\na lot of work to be done before any of these theories can be regarded\nas adequate. Devitt 2001 makes this point in rejecting all of these\nalternative approaches to meaning, claiming that the only viable\napproach is (referential/)truth-conditional semantics.\n\nWhile the orthodoxy of truth-conditional accounts of meaning adds\nweight to this challenge to deflationism, it is still, contra Devitt,\nan open question whether any non-truth-conditional account of meaning\nwill turn out to be adequate. Moreover, even if there is no viable\n\u201ctruth-free\u201d account, several philosophers (e.g., Bar-on,\net al. 2005) have argued that deflationism has no more\nproblem with a truth-conditional theory of meaning than any other\napproach to truth does. Others have gone further, arguing positively\nthat there is no incompatibility between deflationism and\ntruth-conditional theories. Alexis Burgess (2011, 407\u2013410)\nargues that at least some versions of deflationism are compatible with\nmainstream model-theoretic semantics in linguistics (understood as\nproviding explanations of truth conditions) and the recognition of\n\u201cthe manifest power and progress of truth-conditional\nsemantics\u201d. Claire Horisk (2008) argues that\n\u201ccircularity\u201d arguments for incompatibility (or, as she\nprefers, \u201cimmiscibility\u201d) fail. The only circularity\ninvolved here, she claims, is a harmless kind, so long as one is (like\nsome proponents of truth-conditional semantics) offering a reciprocal,\nrather than a reductive, analysis of meaning. Mark Lance (1997,\n186\u20137) claims that any version of deflationism based on an\nanaphoric reading of \u2018is true\u2019 (as in Brandom 1988, 1994)\nis independent of, and thus compatible with, any underlying account of\nmeaning, including a truth-conditional one. Williams 1999 likewise\nclaims that the role of truth in meaning theories for particular\nlanguages is just the expressive role that deflationists claim\nexhausts the notion of truth\u2019s function. Of course, all of these\nclaims have been contested, but they seem to show that the thesis that\ndeflationism is inconsistent with a truth-conditional theory of\nmeaning is neither a forgone conclusion nor necessarily an objection\nto deflationism, even if the thesis is correct. (For further\ndiscussion of this issue, see Gupta 1993b, Field 2005, Gupta and\nMartinez-Fernandez 2005, Patterson 2005, and Horisk 2007.) That said,\none outstanding question that remains regarding the viability of any\ndeflationary approach to truth is whether that approach can be squared\nwith an adequate account of meaning.\n",
