    "main_text": "The Paradox and the Broader Phenomenon || Liar cycles\n1.3 Liar cycles\n\nConsider a very concise (viz., one-sentence-each) dialog between\nsiblings Max and Agnes.\n\n\nMax: \nAgnes\u2019 claim is true. \nAgnes: \nMax\u2019s claim is not true. \n\n\n\nWhat Max said is true if and only if what Agnes said is true. But what\nAgnes said (viz., \u2018Max\u2019s claim is not true\u2019) is true\nif and only if what Max said is not true. Hence, what Max said is true\nif and only if what Max said is not true. But, now, if what Max said\nis true or not true, then it is both true and not true. And this, as\nin the FLiar and ULiar cases, is a contradiction, implying, according\nto many logical theories, absurdity.\n\nLiar paradoxes can also be formed using more complex sentence\nstructures, rather than complex modes of reference. One that has been\nimportant involves Boolean compounds.\n",
