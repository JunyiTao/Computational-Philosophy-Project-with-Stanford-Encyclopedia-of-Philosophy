    "main_text": "Normative issues\n2. Normative issues\n\nPatriotism has had a fair number of critics. The harshest among them\nhave judged it deeply flawed in every important respect. In the\n19th century, Russian novelist and thinker Leo Tolstoy\nfound patriotism both stupid and immoral. It is stupid because every\npatriot holds his own country to be the best of all whereas,\nobviously, only one country can qualify. It is immoral because it\nenjoins us to promote our country\u2019s interests at the expense of\nall other countries and by any means, including war, and is thus at\nodds with the most basic rule of morality, which tells us not to do to\nothers what we would not want them to do to us (Tolstoy 1987, 97).\nRecently, Tolstoy\u2019s critique has been seconded by American\npolitical theorist George Kateb, who argues that patriotism is\n\u201ca mistake twice over: it is typically a grave moral error and\nits source is typically a state of mental confusion\u201d (Kateb\n2000, 901). Patriotism is most importantly expressed in a readiness to\ndie and to kill for one\u2019s country. But a country \u201cis not a\ndiscernible collection of discernible individuals\u201d; it is rather\n\u201can abstraction \u2026 a compound of a few actual and many\nimaginary ingredients.\u201d Specifically, in addition to being a\ndelimited territory, \u201cit is also constructed out of transmitted\nmemories true and false; a history usually mostly falsely sanitized or\nfalsely heroized; a sense of kinship of a largely invented purity; and\nsocial ties that are largely invisible or impersonal, indeed abstract\n\u2026\u201d Therefore patriotism is \u201ca readiness to die and\nto kill for an abstraction \u2026 for what is largely a figment of\nthe imagination\u201d (907).\n\nSome of these objections can easily be countered. Even if full-fledged\npatriotism does involve a belief in one\u2019s country\u2019s\nmerits, it need not involve the belief that one\u2019s country is\nbetter than all others. And the fact that a country is not a\ncollection of \u201cdiscernible individuals\u201d and that the\nsocial ties among compatriots are \u201clargely invisible or\nimpersonal,\u201d rather than palpable and face-to-face, does not\nshow that it is unreal or imaginary. As Benedict Anderson, who coined\nthe term \u201cimagined community,\u201d points out, \u201call\ncommunities larger than primordial villages of face-to-face contact\n\u2026 are imagined.\u201d \u201cImagined community\u201d is not\nthe opposite of \u201creal community,\u201d but rather of community\nwhose members have face-to-face relations (Anderson 1991, 6).\n\nHowever, there is another, more plausible line of criticism of\npatriotism focusing on its intellectual, rather than moral\ncredentials. Moreover, Tolstoy\u2019s and Kateb\u2019s arguments\nquestioning the moral legitimacy of patriotic partiality and those\nhighlighting the connection of patriotism with international tensions\nand war cannot be so easily refuted.\n",
