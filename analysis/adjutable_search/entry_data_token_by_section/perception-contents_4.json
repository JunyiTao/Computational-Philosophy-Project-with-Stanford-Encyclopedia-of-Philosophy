    "main_text": "Contents as Accuracy Conditions || Content and Attitude\n2.3 Content and Attitude\n\nInstead of holding that the perceptual content derives from the\ncontent of belief, one might instead hold that the contents of\nperception and the contents of belief are in some sense analogous, and\nmore generally that experiences and beliefs are similarly structured\nby contents on the one hand, and a relation to those contents, on the\nother.\n\nBeliefs are often thought to be relations to contents, and contents of\nbeliefs are often thought to be contents that one can stand in other\nrelations toward, besides belief. Such relations are sometimes called\n\u2018attitudes\u2019, where examples of these are supposed to be\nnotions from folk-psychology such as hoping, wanting, or supposing.\nHowever, it is useful to construe the notion of \u2018attitude\u2019\nmore broadly, so that it is more generally a way of having content.\nSubpersonal states of visual processing, if they are informational\nstates with accuracy conditions (and so with contents in our sense),\nwill instantiate ways of having content; so would the propositional\nattitudes as they are traditionally conceived. From now on\n\u2018attitudes\u2019 will be relations in which one can stand to\ncontents, when one has a contentful mental state. Both philosophers\nand psychologists have found it useful to mark such a\n distinction.[1]\n More recently, Crane (2003) calls attitudes in this broader sense\n\u2018intentional modes\u2019. (See also Searle 1983, Chapter 1.)\nThese are all distinctions between aspects of mental states, where one\nfeature (akin to content) characterizes the subject-matter of the\nmental state, and the other (akin to attitude) characterizes a mode of\nentertaining it.\n\nIf experiences have contents, then they will be structured by attitude\nand content: the experiences will have content in an experiential way.\nSeveral substantive questions arise about what experiential attitudes\nare.\n\nFirst, it is an open question how finely grained the experiential\nattitudes may be. A natural proposal is that there are different\nexperiential ways of having content corresponding to the different\nsense modalities. But it is far from given that the modalities mark\nout natural kinds of sensory experience, let alone the only natural\nkinds of such experience, since it is a complicated question how to\ndistinguish the different kinds of sensory experience from one\nanother. Furthermore, there are multi-sensory phenomena, such as\nsynesthesia, which defy straightforward categorization as a single\nkind of sensory experience. Another problem case may be the experience\nof bodily actions, in which (say) visual, kinesthetic and tactile\nexperiences are intertwined. (See Press et al. 2004, Kennett\net al. 2001 and Fotopoulou et al. 2009 for\ndiscussion of cases in which visual experience enhances tactile acuity\nand kinesthetic experience generally).\n\nSecond, it is a substantive question what constitutes an\nexperiential way of having content. Tye (1995, 2000) has\nproposed that what makes a state have a content in the experiential\nway is that it has a certain functional role: it is\n\u2018poised\u2019 for a certain kind of use in the cognitive\nsystem; and in addition it has non-conceptual content (see\n Section 6.2)\n and is not individuated by any objects that it may represent. Another\noption is that what makes a state have content in an experiential way\nis that it has the appropriate sort of phenomenology (see Chalmers\n2004). A third option is that the experiential way of entertaining\ncontent overlaps with the belief way of entertaining it\u2014whatever\nexactly that is. This last option seems to underlie a very influential\nidea developed in Armstrong and Pitcher\u2019s proposals, that\nexperiences are belief-like in an important way. (Cf.\nPendelbury\u2019s discussion of sensuous belief in his 1986;\nHeck\u2019s discussion of \u2018assertoric force\u2019 in his 2000;\nMartin\u2019s discussion of \u2018coerciveness\u2019 in his 2002).\nThese options are not exclusive.\n\nThird, it is a substantive question to what extent attitude and\ncontent are independent from one another. Once we fix on an\nexperiential way of entertaining content, what if anything limits the\nrange of contents that can be entertained in that way? Going in the\nother direction, once we fix on a content, are there limits on what\nattitudes may be taken toward it? How this question is answered bears\non several neighboring issues. If any content that can be entertained\nexperientially can also be entertained unconsciously, then it will not\nbe contents alone that give an experience its phenomenality. The\nquestion also bears on the question of whether there is\nnon-conceptual content (see\n Section 6.2\n and the entry on\n non-conceptual content).\n\nFourth, it is sometimes assumed that if experiences are structured by\nattitude and content, then experience types will be individuated by\ntheir specific attitude plus their contents, so that if an experience\nE1 with content C is type-identical to an\nexperience E2, then E2 will\nalso have content C, and E1 and\nE2 will instantiate the same experiential\nattitude. The source of this idea may be an analogous claim about\nbeliefs: namely, the claim that if belief B1 with\ncontent C is the same belief-type as B2,\nthen B2 will also have content C.\nHowever, it should not be taken as a consequence of the claim that\nexperiences have content that their contents individuate\nexperience-types. Rather, this is a substantive claim that needs both\nrefinement and defense. Even if beliefs were individuated by their\ncontents, that would not suffice to show that experiences are as well.\nSome additional reason would be needed to think that experiences and\nbeliefs are alike in this respect.\n\nIf one holds that experiences are not constitutively linked to beliefs\nbut are similarly structured by attitude and content, then this is one\nmotivation for thinking there are experiential attitudes distinct from\nbelief. However, one could hold that experiences are so structured (by\nattitude and content), while also holding that experiences have their\ncontents in virtue of their connections to beliefs.\n",
