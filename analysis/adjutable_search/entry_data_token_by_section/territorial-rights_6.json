    "main_text": "Theories of Territory in Historical Perspective || Justice theories: Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804)\n2.3 Justice theories: Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804)\n\nIn some respects, Kantian arguments for territorial rights are the\nexact reverse of Locke\u2019s. Kant offers a general justification of\nthe state as necessary to the pursuit of justice, but then, having\nshown that the state is necessary to justice, this argument has\ndifficulty in explaining which bits of territory each state ought to\nhave.\n\nKant first defends the right to occupy and appropriate objects as\nimplicit in, and justified by, the exercise of individual freedom. He\nthen points out that removing things from common use prevents other\npeople from enjoying the object in question, and this unilateral\nexercise of one\u2019s freedom is therefore incompatible with the\nexercise of other people\u2019s freedom. The only way out of this\ndilemma is through the multilateral recognition of \u2018rights of\nproperty\u2019 (by which he means agreement on the obligation to\nrespect the acquisition, transfer and use of objects in the external\nworld) and institutions of justice to set and enforce these\nmultilateral rights. This provides an argument for why people who live\nin close proximity to one another, and therefore cannot avoid\ninteracting, are morally obliged to enter the civil condition and\nacknowledge a political authority whose coercive law can guarantee\ntheir property rights. On Kant\u2019s account, everyone in the state\nof nature has an obligation to leave a \u2018a state devoid of\njustice\u2019 and replace it with \u2018a rightful\ncondition\u2019.\n\nThis theory successfully justifies the exercise of jurisdictional\nauthority\u2014indeed, the argument that we are subject to authority\nbecause it is required by justice is probably the most compelling\njustification of state power on offer. However, there are difficulties\nfor this theory in explaining and justifying why that authority is\nheld over particular areas of the earth. It is a short step from this\ntype of argument to appeal to a principle of proximity to mark out a\ndomain in which people are unavoidably interacting with one another,\nand then explain why people who are proximate must be under the same\nauthority, because likely to fall into disputes (Waldron 2009).\nHowever, since there are many possible domains of possible\ninteraction, the argument does not tell us which territorial unit we\nshould join in cases where we stand midway between one group of\nproximate people who are in the process of creating state A,\nand a second group who are creating state B; and some members\nof our group seek to create state C (Miller 2011). It\u2019s\nclear that we should join a political community, so that we are not in\na lawless condition, and indeed it appears that all the contenders\nmight be justified in compelling us to join their political community,\nbut it is indeterminate about which political community ought to\nexercise rightful authority over us. Kant\u2019s argument avoids\ndiscussing this dilemma only by appealing to considerations which fall\noutside of the Kantian theory itself: he points out that people tend,\nas an empirical fact, to be naturally grouped along linguistic or\nreligious lines, and that membership in these cultural groups helps to\ndefine particular jurisdictional domains (Kant PP: I, first\nsupp., para. 2). This empirical assumption helps Kant to escape what\nmight appear to be the cosmopolitan logic of his account: without\nappeal to that purely contingent fact of people\u2019s preference to\nassociate politically with others who are religiously or culturally\nsimilar, it seems that the logic of his account is universal. Although\nKant himself offered various reasons for opposing a world state (Kant\nMM: II; 53\u201361) it is not clear that these reasons are\nconsistent with the logic of his theory. \n\nOne could, of course, accept a universalist, Kantian account of state\nauthority, but supplement that account with subsidiary principles,\nwhich help to define the boundaries of particular authorities. But if\nthose subsidiary principles are more than principles of convenience or\naffirmations of the status quo, both of which are problematic, then it\nmeans that Kant\u2019s theory can\u2019t be a stand-alone successful\naccount, but has to be hybridized with another account. This is\nbecause Kant\u2019s theory provides a successful justification for\nstate authority but needs another account to justify each\nstate\u2019s particular territory.\n",
