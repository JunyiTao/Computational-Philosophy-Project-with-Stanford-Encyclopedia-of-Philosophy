Wabi: Simple, Austere Beauty\n\nIn aforementioned Essays in Idleness Kenk\u014d asks,\n\u201cAre we to look at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, at the\nmoon only when it is cloudless?\u201d (Keene, 115). If for the\nBuddhists the basic condition is impermanence, to privilege as\nconsummate only certain moments in the eternal flux may signify a\nrefusal to accept that basic condition. Kenk\u014d continues:\n\u201cTo long for the moon while looking on the rain, to lower the\nblinds and be unaware of the passing of the spring\u2014these are\neven more deeply moving. Branches about to blossom or gardens strewn\nwith faded flowers are worthier of our admiration.\u201d This is an\nexample of the idea of wabi, understated beauty, which was\nfirst distinguished and praised when expressed in poetry. But it is in\nthe art of tea, and the context of Zen, that the notion of\nwabi is most fully developed.\n\nIn the Namp\u014droku (1690), a record of sayings by the tea\nmaster Sen no Riky\u016b, we read: \u201cIn the small [tea] room, it\nis desirable for every utensil to be less than adequate. There are\nthose who dislike a piece when it is even slightly damaged; such an\nattitude shows a complete lack of comprehension\u201d (Hirota, 226).\nImplements with minor imperfections are often valued more highly, on\nthe wabi aesthetic, than ones that are ostensibly perfect;\nand broken or cracked utensils, as long as they have been well\nrepaired, more highly than the intact. The wabi aesthetic\ndoes not imply asceticism but rather moderation, as this passage from\nthe Namp\u014droku demonstrates: \u201cThe meal for a\ngathering in a small room should be but a single soup and two or three\ndishes; sak\u00e8 should also be served in moderation. Elaborate\npreparation of food for the wabi gathering is\ninappropriate\u201d (Hirota, 227).\n\nThe Zencharoku (Zen Tea Record, 1828) contains a well known\nsection on the topic of wabi, which begins by saying that it\nis simply a matter of \u201cupholding the [Buddhist] precepts\u201d\n(Hirota, 274). The author continues:\n\nWabi means that even in straitened circumstances no thought\nof hardship arises. Even amid insufficiency, one is moved by no\nfeeling of want. Even when faced with failure, one does not brood over\ninjustice. If you find being in straitened circumstances to be\nconfining, if you lament insufficiency as privation, if you complain\nthat things have been ill-disposed\u2014this is not wabi.\n(Hirota, 275)\n\n\nThe way of tea exemplifies this attitude toward life in the elegant\nsimplicity of the tea house and the utensils, which contradicts any\nnotion that beauty must entail magnificence and opulence.\n\nWabi reaches its peak of austerity in emptiness\u2014which\nis a central and pervasive idea in Buddhism. In an essay \u201cIn\nPraise of Shadows\u201d (1933) the great novelist Tanizaki\nJun\u2019ichir\u014d (1886\u20131965) has this to say about the\nbeauty of the alcove (tokonoma) in the traditional Japanese\nteahouse:\n\nAn empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that\nthe light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is\nnothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers\nbehind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves,\nthough we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with\nthe feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns\ncomplete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable\ntranquility holds sway. (Tanizaki, 20)\n\n\nA simple structure, but a special and evocative one, a place of deeply\nphilosophical depths. A space cut out of the room, which cuts off\ndirect light and thereby opens up a new world: these techniques\ndeveloped distinctively in the Japanese tradition of architecture.\n(See section 7, below, on cutting.)\n\nThis was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light\nfrom this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that\nformed there a quality of mystery or depth superior to that of any\nwall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no\nmeans so simply achieved.\n\n\nInstead of adding something artistic to the wall one subtracts the\nwall itself and sets it back into an alcove. Then let the emptiness\nthat\u2019s opened up fill with a play of light and shades.\n\nOne place with a claim to be where the Japanese tea ceremony\noriginated is Ginkakuji, The Temple of the Silver Pavilion, in Kyoto.\nWhereas the pavilion (late 15th century) is a modest monument to the\njoys of sabi, the Moon-Viewing Platform and Sea of Silver\nSand beside it (from some 200 years later) are paradigms of\nWabi. These latter two constitute an unusual version of the\ndistinctively Japanese \u201cdry landscape\u201d style of garden\n(see section 7, below). These strikingly abstract formations (for the\n17th century!) are optimally viewed from the second floor of the\npavilion on a night of the full moon, when the sand glistens silver in\nthe moonlight and the stripes appear as waves on the surface of a\nmotionless ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger Photographs of the Sea of Silver Sand and Moon-Viewing Platform at Ginkakuji\n\n\n",
