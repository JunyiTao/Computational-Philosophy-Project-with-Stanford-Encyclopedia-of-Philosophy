    "main_text": "The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature\n4. The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature\n\nIn the late 1930s, Horkheimer described all of his efforts as working\ntoward a project on dialectical logic (Wiggershaus 1994, 177). This\n\u201cdialectics project\u201d would, through many twists and turns,\ndevelop into ideas presented primarily in two books published in 1947.\nHorkheimer was the sole author of Eclipse of Reason, which\nappeared originally in English. The book incorporates and expands on a\nseries of lectures delivered at Columbia University in 1944, and, as\nHorkheimer writes in its preface, presents \u201cin epitome some\naspects\u201d of his work with Adorno from that time (p. vi). That\nwork with Adorno would also produce Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, a collaborative text that was first published in\n1947, after having been distributed as a limited edition typescript in\n1944. It would become the most famous work of the \u201cfirst\ngeneration\u201d of the Frankfurt School, and is surely the work most\ncommonly associated with Horkheimer\u2019s\n name.[4]\n The rest of this section will review the major themes of\nHorkheimer\u2019s work from the 1940s, considering both Dialectic\nof Enlightenment and Eclipse of Reason together.\n",
