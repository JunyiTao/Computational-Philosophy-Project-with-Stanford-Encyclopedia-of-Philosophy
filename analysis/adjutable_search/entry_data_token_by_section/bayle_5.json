    "main_text": "Problem of Evil\n6. Problem of Evil\n\nIf a perfectly good and all-powerful God alone created everything in\nthe universe, then why do pain, moral wickedness, and so many\nvarieties of imperfection exist? Philosophers today refer to the\nfamily of issues raised by this question as \u201cthe problem of\nevil\u201d. There is perhaps no thesis for which Bayle is more\nwell-known than the skeptical claim that there is no rational solution\nto the problem of evil. The centerpiece of any discussion of Bayle and\nthe problem of evil must be the Dictionary, particularly the\narticles \u201cManicheans\u201d and \u201cPaulicians\u201d of the\nfirst edition, and the \u201cClarification on the Manicheans\u201d\nof the second. It is in these texts that Bayle attempts to refute\nevery theodicy he had yet encountered, thereby demonstrating the\nincapacity of reason, especially within the confines of Christian\ndogma, to explain the origin of evil in a way that does not make God\nits sole author. The suggestion that reason leads us ineluctably to\nthe conclusion that God is morally responsible for all evil was found\nso scandalous that Bayle was forced to spend the last decade of his\nlife defending himself against charges of atheism and even sedition on\naccount of it. The Rationalist theologians Jean Le Clerc and Isaac\nJaquelot were Bayle\u2019s principal adversaries, and their\nobjections to Bayle, as well as their attempts at theodicy, prompted\nhim to expand his skeptical reflections on evil in subsequent books,\nincluding the Responses to a Provincial\u2019s Questions,\nand the posthumous Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius. These\nfinal works were the occasional cause of Leibniz\u2019s\nTheodicy (1710), as well as the inspiration for (and source\nfor many of the arguments of) Voltaire\u2019s satirical novella,\nCandide (1759), several chapters of Hume\u2019s\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779), and possibly\nKant\u2019s late essay, On the Miscarriage of All Philosophical\nTrials in Theodicy (1791).\n\nBayle\u2019s controversial \u201cdoctrine\u201d on the problem of\nevil that caused so much commotion was carefully summarized by Bayle\nhimself in three points:\n\nThe natural light and revelation teach us clearly that there is\nonly one principle of all things, and that this principle is\ninfinitely perfect;\nThe way of reconciling the moral and physical evil of humanity\nwith all the attributes of this single, infinitely perfect principle\nof all things surpasses our philosophical lights, such that the\nManichean objections leave us with difficulties that human reason\ncannot resolve;\nNevertheless, it is necessary to believe firmly what the natural\nlight and revelation teach us about the unity and infinite perfection\nof God, just as it is necessary to believe by faith and submission to\ndivine authority the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation. (OD\nIII: 992b\u2013993a)\n\n\nThe first principle was a common supposition in Bayle\u2019s day, and\nso obviously caused no controversy. Nevertheless, Bayle argued on\nbehalf of the principle in \u201cManicheans\u201d, remark D, in\npassages that render more precise the nature of Bayle\u2019s\nskepticism about theodicy. Bayle imagines a monotheist philosopher,\nMelissus, arguing with a dualist philosopher, Zoroaster, over the\norigin of evil. The dispute begins with a contest over a\npriori arguments. In other words, the first question raised is\nwhether one principle of creation or two is most in accord with ideas\nof pure reason. Melissus wins this particular debate, in Bayle\u2019s\nview, because it is more agreeable to a priori reason to\nsuppose that there is just one necessary and infinitely perfect being\nresponsible for the creation of the universe than to suppose that\nthere are two warring gods, one good and the other evil (which is the\nview of Bayle\u2019s fictionalized Zoroaster). Melissus\u2019\nmonotheism is, in short, simpler and more elegant than\nZoroaster\u2019s dualism.\n\nThe contentious elements of Bayle\u2019s doctrine begin to surface\nwhen the debate then turns to a posteriori reasons; that is,\nonce the question shifts away from the beauty of the theory to its\nability to account for the observable phenomena. In this debate\nMelissus fares worse than his interlocutor, since human reason\nfinds\n\n\nthe manner in which evil was introduced under the empire of a\nsovereign being, infinitely good, infinitely holy, and infinitely\npowerful \u2026 not only inexplicable, but even incomprehensible;\nand everything that is opposed to the reasons why this being permitted\nevil is more agreeable to the natural light and to the ideas of order\nthan these reasons are. (Dictionary,\n\u201cPaulicians\u201d, remark E)\n\n\nSimplicity and elegance are now on the side of Zoroaster (and the\nManichean tradition that followed him, if Bayle\u2019s history is\ncorrect), for whom all the good in the world is traceable to a\nperfectly benevolent deity, while all the evil is the effect of his\nmalevolent enemy. Therefore, whereas a priori reason and\nChristian Scripture point toward monotheism (Bayle\u2019s first\nprinciple), a posteriori reason raises perpetual difficulties\nfor this picture in light of the way the world actually is\n(Bayle\u2019s second principle).\n\nSome of the most notorious remarks in the Dictionary are\nthose in which Bayle details how a dualist could refute the\ntraditional Christian accounts of the origin of evil, most of which\nbegin from the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden. Bayle begins his critique by asking how such a Fall was even\nmetaphysically possible. If Adam and Eve were created wholly good,\nthen they should not have had the capacity to sin, since such a\ncapacity is hardly a good quality. But supposing an answer to this\nworry could be given, Bayle moves on to demand why God would permit\nthe possibility of sin to reduce to an actual sin, considering the\nterrible consequences that befell humanity as a result of it. The most\ncommon response to this question was that God had given human beings\nfree will, the most generous divine gift of all, and the autonomy of\nwhich God willed to respect in order to make true worship and love of\nhim possible. Bayle\u2019s response again focuses on the metaphysical\npossibility of the explanation: can a creature that derives all its\nbeing from God ever act in a manner that is truly free? Even supposing\nan account of freedom could be offered to answer this question, Bayle\nstill finds the free-will defence unsatisfying on account of\nGod\u2019s alleged omniscience. Surely God foresaw the first sin of\nhumankind from all eternity, yet he created humans with freedom\nanyway. Is this not comparable, Bayle asks, to supplying a criminal\nwith a knife knowing full-well that he will commit murder with it? If\nso, the responsibility for the murder falls at least partially on the\nsupplier of the weapon. But perhaps God allowed humans to fall so that\nhe could send his Son to redeem them. To this last resort of the\nChristians\u2014the felix culpa theodicy\u2014Bayle\nobserves that God in this case would resemble a father who allowed his\nson to break his arm (though he could have prevented it) just so that\nhe could display his skill at cast-making to the neighbors. Or God\nwould be like a king who permitted a deadly uprising just so he could\ndemonstrate his ability to quell it. God would not appear\ninfinitely perfect on any of these hypotheses.\n\nSuch reflections demonstrate the need for Bayle\u2019s third\nprinciple (assuming that one is interested in upholding Christian\nmonotheism). The origin of evil, like the Trinity, is a mystery\nfraught with endless difficulties. On Bayle\u2019s view of religious\nmysteries, which he lays out at the beginning of his Clarification\non the Manicheans, philosophical objections to mysteries are\nnothing troubling, but merely serve to confirm that God\u2019s mind\ninfinitely surpasses human minds. If there were no insoluble\nphilosophical objections to mysteries, then there would be nothing\nmysterious about the doctrines in question-reason could answer every\ndifficulty, and could claim equality with God\u2019s own mind. For\nthese reasons Bayle conflated the traditional categories of\n\u201cabove reason\u201d and \u201cagainst reason\u201d, claiming\nthat mysteries were necessarily both. Reason is consequently useless,\neven pernicious, as a basis for belief in the mysteries, and so must\nbe replaced by simple faith (Bayle\u2019s third principle).\n\nBayle\u2019s most able philosophical critic on these issues during\nhis lifetime was Le Clerc, who argued that Bayle\u2019s doctrine on\nthe problem of evil was intentionally subversive of religion. The\nbasis of Le Clerc\u2019s accusation of atheism against Bayle was his\nclaim that it is not psychologically possible to continue to believe\nsome doctrine after one has conceded that it is met with insoluble\ndifficulties. If this psychology of belief were true, then the second\nprinciple of Bayle\u2019s doctrine would destroy belief in monotheism\nbecause, by supposition, it would be impossible to believe in the\nunity of God after acknowledging the irresistible force of the\nManicheans\u2019 objections. In response to Le Clerc, Bayle argued in\nhis posthumous Dialogues of Maximus and Themistius that it is\nnot only psychologically possible to believe in a proposition that has\nbeen defeated in argument, but also very common. Bayle points to the\ndebate over the continuum to illustrate his thesis. Those engaged in\nthe debate over whether lines are infinitely divisible or ultimately\nreducible to points of finite size recognize that there are insoluble\nparadoxes opposed to each point of view. Yet there are adherents of\nboth views all the same, which demonstrates, by historical fact, that\nit is possible to believe in a proposition (e.g., \u201clines are\ninfinitely divisible\u201d) despite recognizing unanswerable\ndifficulties (e.g., Zeno\u2019s paradoxes). Far from a recommendation\nof adopting irrational fideism in response to the problem of evil,\nBayle therefore believed he was urging the same rational retreat from\ncertain debates that philosophers are commonly forced into when they\nargue about labyrinthine philosophical topics like the continuum.\n",
