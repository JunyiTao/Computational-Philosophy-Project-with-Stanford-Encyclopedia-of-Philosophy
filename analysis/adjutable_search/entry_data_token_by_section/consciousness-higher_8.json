    "main_text": "Objections to a Higher-Order Approach || Local objections\n7.2 Generic objections\n\nOne generic objection, which can probably be recast in such a way as\nto apply to any higher-order theory (although it is most easily\nexpressed against inner sense theory or actualist HOT theory), is the\nso-called \u2018rock\u2019 objection (Goldman 1993; Stubenberg\n1998). We don\u2019t think that when we become aware of a rock\n(either perceiving it, or entertaining a thought about it) that the\nrock thereby becomes conscious. So why should our higher-order\nawareness of a mental state render that mental state conscious?\nThinking about a rock doesn\u2019t make the rock \u2018light\nup\u2019 and become phenomenally conscious. So why should thinking\nabout my perception of the rock make the latter phenomenally\nconscious, either?\n\nAn initial reply to this objection involves pointing out that my\nperception of the rock is a mental state, whereas the rock\nitself isn\u2019t (Lycan 1996). Since phenomenal consciousness is a\nproperty that (some) mental states possess, we can then say that the\nreason why the rock isn\u2019t rendered phenomenally conscious by my\nawareness of it is that it isn\u2019t the right sort of\nthing to\nbe phenomenally conscious, whereas my perception of the rock\nis. This reply may be apt to strike the objector as trite. But perhaps\nmore can be said from the perspective of inner sense theory, at least.\nNotice that my perception of the rock does, in one sense, confer on the\nlatter a subjective aspect. For example, the rock is represented from\none particular spatial perspective, and only some of its properties\n(e.g. color) and not others (e.g. mass) are represented. Likewise,\nthen, with my perception of the rock. \n\nSimilar replies to the rock objection are given by Van Gulick (2001)\nand Gennaro (2005). Both point out that a rock isn\u2019t the kind of\nthing that can be incorporated into a complex mental state\nthat involves higher-order representations, in the sort of way\nrequired by a self-representational or HOT theory. In contrast,\nwhether actualist HOT theory can reply adequately to the rock\nobjection will depend on whether or not there is an adequate reply to\nthe problem considered in section 4, which challenges the actualist\nHOT theorist to say why targeting a mental state with a HOT about that\nstate should cause the latter to \u2018light up\u2019 and acquire a\nsubjective dimension or\nfeel.\n\nAnother generic objection is that higher-order theories, when combined\nwith plausible empirical claims about the mental abilities of\nnon-human animals, will conflict with our common-sense intuition that\nsuch animals enjoy phenomenally conscious experience (Jamieson and\nBekoff 1992; Dretske 1995; Tye 1995; Seager 2004). This objection can\nbe pressed most forcefully against higher-order thought\ntheories, of either variety, and against self-representational\ntheories; but it is also faced by inner-sense theory (depending on\nwhat account can be offered of the evolutionary function of organs of\ninner sense). Are cats and dogs really capable of having such\napparently complex HOTs which presumably contain mental state\nconcepts? Since there has been onsiderable dispute as to whether even\nchimpanzees (and other primates) have the kind of sophisticated\n\u2018theory of mind\u2019 to enable them to entertain thoughts\nabout experiential states as such (Byrne and Whiten 1988, 1998;\nPovinelli 2000), it seems implausible that many other species of\nmammal (let alone reptiles, birds, and fish) would qualify as\nphenomenally conscious, on these accounts (Carruthers 2000, 2005). Yet\nthe intuition that such creatures enjoy phenomenally conscious\nexperiences is a powerful one, for many people. (Witness Nagel\u2019s\nclassic 1974 paper, which argues that there must be something that it\nis like to be a bat.)\n\nMany higher-order theorists have attempted to resist the claim that\ntheir theory has any such entailment (e.g.  Gennaro 1996, 2004; Van\nGulick 2006). In each case, a common strategy is to claim that the\nrelevant higher-order representations are somehow\nsimpler than those tested for by those who do comparative\n\u2018theory of mind\u2019 research, hence leaving it open that\nthese simpler representations might be widespread in the animal\nkingdom. Gennaro (1996), for example, suggests that although animals\nmight lack the concept experience, they can nevertheless be\ncapable of higher-order indexical thoughts of the form\n\u2018this is different from that\u2019 (where\n\u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 might refer to experiences\nof red and of green, respectively). The trouble here, however, is to\nexplain what makes these indexicals higher-order in content without\nattributing concepts like experience of green to the animal.\n\n\nGennaro (2004) takes a somewhat different tack. While allowing that\nanimals lack the concept experience of green, he thinks that\nthey might nevertheless possess the (simpler) concept seeing\ngreen. But here he faces a dilemma. There is, indeed, a simpler\nconcept of seeing, grounded in the capacity to track eye-direction and\nline of sight. But this isn\u2019t necessarily a higher-order\nconcept. To say, in this sense, that someone sees green in just to say\nthat there is some green in the line in which their eyes are\npointed\u2014no mental state needs to be attributed. In contrast, it\nappears that any concept of seeing that is genuinely higher-order will\nbe one that it would be less plausible to attribute to most species of\nanimal (given the comparative evidence). Perhaps a first-order\nexplanation of experimental observations of animals is virtually\nalways possible (see, for example, Carruthers 2008). But Gennaro\n(2012, chapter eight) ultimately argues that there is plenty of\nevidence that many animals are capable of metacognition (thinking\nabout their own mental states) as well as mindreading (thinking about\nother minds).  For example, in the case of mindreading, rhesus monkeys\nseem to attribute visual and auditory perceptions to others in more\ncompetitive paradigms (Flombaum and Santos 2005) and crows and scrub\njays return alone to caches seen by other animals and recache them in\nnew places (Emery and Clayton 2001). Any evidence of deception or\nempathy in animals would also seem to indicate some kind of\nmindreading ability. In addition, many animals seem capable of\nmetacognition (including possessing self-concepts) as evidenced by the\npresence of episodic memory, for example (Dere et al. 2006; see also\nthe essays in Terrace and Metcalf 2005; Hurley and Nudds 2006).  A\nrelated debate takes place with respect to infant consciousness and\nthe capacity of infants to have metacognitive and mindreading\nabilities (see Gennaro 2012, chapter seven, for some\ndiscussion).  \n\nVan Gulick (2006), in contrast, suggests that all of the higher-order\nrepresenting sufficient to render an experience phenomenally conscious\ncan be left merely implicit in the way that the experience\nenters into relationships with other mental states and the control of\nbehavior. So animals that lack the sorts of explicit higher-order\nconcepts tested for in comparative \u2018theory of mind\u2019\nresearch can nevertheless be phenomenally conscious. The difficulty\nhere, however, is to flesh out the relevant notion of implicitness in\nsuch a way that not every mental state, possessed by every creature\n(no matter how simple), will count as phenomenally conscious. For\nsince mental states can\u2019t occur singly, but are always part of a\nnetwork of other related states, mental states will always carry\ninformation about others, thus implicitly representing them. It is\nimplicit in the behavior of any creature that drinks, for example,\nthat it is thirsty; so the drinking behavior implicitly represents the\noccurrence of the mental state of thirst. \n\nOf course, the basis for the common-sense intuition that animals\npossess phenomenally conscious states can even be challenged. (How,\nafter all, are we supposed to know whether it is like\nsomething to be a bat?) And that intuition can perhaps be explained\naway as a mere by-product of imaginative identification with the\nanimal. (Since our\nimages of their experiences are phenomenally conscious, we\nmay naturally assume that the experiences imaged are\nsimilarly conscious (Carruthers 1999, 2000). But there is no doubt\nthat one major source of resistance to higher-order theories will lie\nhere, for many people, especially given various moral considerations\nabout animal pain and suffering. (For one set of attempts to defuse\nthis resistance, arguing that a higher-order account need have few if\nany implications for our moral practices or for comparative\npsychology, see Carruthers 2005, chapter nine; 2019, chapter eight.)\nOf course, some will point out that there are also\nenough neurophysiological similarities between (at least some\nparts of) human and animal brains to justify attributions of, say,\npains, desires, and basic perceptual states. It is worth emphasizing\nhere that HOT theory does not say that having conscious\nstates requires having introspective states, that is, having\nconscious HOTs. Conflating introspection with having mere unconscious\nHOTs (and therefore simply having first-order conscious states) may\nlead some to put forth a misguided straw man argument against HOT\ntheory.\n\nA third generic objection is that higher-order approaches cannot\nreally explain the distinctive properties of phenomenal\nconsciousness (Chalmers 1996; Siewert 1998; Levine 2006). Whereas the\nargument from animals is that higher-order representations\naren\u2019t\nnecessary for phenomenal consciousness, the argument here is\nthat such representations aren\u2019t sufficient. It is claimed,\nfor example, that we can easily conceive of creatures who enjoy the\npostulated kinds of higher-order representation, related in the right\nsort of way to their first-order perceptual states, but where those\ncreatures are wholly lacking in phenomenal consciousness.\n\nIn response to this objection, higher-order theorists will join forces\nwith first-order theorists and others in claiming that these objectors\npitch the standards for explaining phenomenal consciousness too high\n(Block and Stalnaker 1999; Tye 1999; Carruthers 2000, 2005; Lycan\n2001). They will insist that a reductive explanation of\nsomething\u2014and of phenomenal consciousness in\nparticular\u2014doesn\u2019t have to be such that we cannot conceive\nof the explanandum (that which is being explained) in the\nabsence of the explanans (that which does the explaining).\n(Indeed, we can also explain why no such explanation can be\nforthcoming, in terms of our possession of purely recognitional\nconcepts of experience.) Rather, we just need to have good reason to\nthink that the explained properties are constituted\nby the explaining ones, in such a way that nothing\nelse needed to be added to the world once the explaining\nproperties were present, in order for the world to contain the target\nphenomenon. But this is hotly contested territory. And it is on this\nground that the battle for phenomenal consciousness may ultimately be\nwon or lost.\n\nBefore we close, it is worth considering a variant of the third\ngeneric objection that we have just been discussing, which need\ninvolve no commitment to the latter\u2019s demanding standards of\nexplanation. For it might be said that self-representing mental states\n(or indeed any of the theoretically-relevant kinds of pairing of\nfirst-order with higher-order representations) might occur within the\nunconscious mind, without (of course) thereby becoming conscious (Rey,\n2008). Suppose that some version of Freudian theory is true, for\nexample. Might there not be higher-order thoughts about the\nsubject\u2019s experiences occurring within the unconscious mind,\nformed while the latter tries to figure out how to get its messages\npast the \u2018censor\u2019 and expressed in speech? So here again,\njust as with the third generic objection, the claim is that the\noccurrence of the sorts of representations postulated by higher-order\ntheories isn\u2019t\nsufficient for phenomenal consciousness.\n\nOne sort of response to this objection would be to deny that such\npurely unconscious higher-order cognition ever actually\noccurs. Indeed, one might deny that it is even possible, given the\nconstraints provided by the evolution of cognitively demanding mental\nfunctions (Carruthers 2000). But note that this reply will be\nunavailable to any higher-order theorist who has opted to downplay the\ncognitive demands of the capacity for higher-order representation in\nresponse to the problem of animal consciousness. For if higher-order\nrepresentation is easily evolved, and is rife within the animal\nkingdom, then there doesn\u2019t appear to be any reason why it\nshouldn\u2019t evolve within unconscious sub-systems of the mind as\nwell. And in any case it is doubtful whether the mere natural\nimpossibility of higher-order representing within the unconscious mind\nwould be enough to rebut the objection. Since higher-order theories\nclaim that phenomenal consciousness is to be identified with,\nor is\nconstituted by, the relevant sorts of higher-order\nrepresenting, we would need to show that the imagined occurrence of\nthe latter within the unconscious mind is metaphysically\nimpossible, not just that it is naturally so.\n\nOther responses to the objection remain (Carruthers 2000, 2005). One\nwould be to allow that unconscious phenomenal consciousness is\npossible, and to appeal to the distinction between phenomenal\nconsciousness and access consciousness to explain away the\nseeming contradiction involved. Remember, phenomenally conscious\nstates are those that it is like something to be in, and that\npossess a subjective feel; whereas access-conscious states\nare those that are available to interact with some specified cognitive\nprocesses (for example, they might be those that are reportable in\nspeech). So all we would be saying is that states with feel\ncan occur in ways that aren\u2019t (for example) reportable by the\nsubject.  There is no contradiction here. An alternative possible\nresponse would be to extend the higher-order theory in question to\ninclude the relevant sort of access-consciousness as a further\ncomponent. A dispositional HOT theorist, for example, might say that a\nphenomenally conscious state is one that both possesses the\nright sort of dual content and that is reportable by the\nsubject. I shall not attempt to adjudicate between these possibilities\nhere.\n\n(Objections have also been raised as to how (or if) HOT theory and\nself-representational theories can account for various pathologies of\nself-awareness or \u2018depersonalization disorders,\u2019 such as\nsomatoparaphrenia and thought insertion in schizophrenia. See the\nessays in Gennaro 2015 for some discussion.)\n",
