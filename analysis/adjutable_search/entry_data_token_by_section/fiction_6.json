    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Fiction, Pretense, and Cognitive Psychology\n1.6 Fiction, Pretense, and Cognitive Psychology\n\nIn the previous subsection we considered views, beginning with\nCurrie\u2019s, that take awareness that certain sentences are true to\ncount against their status as fiction, or that look to more holistic\nfeatures of the text to show why this awareness does not compromise\ntheir status as fiction. These views\nall hold that merely appealing to the imagination does not capture\nwhat is essential to fiction; they attempt in different ways to\nidentify what else is necessary. In the next section we look at some\ninfluential new challenges to these views, but in the present section\nwe adopt a different orientation. In order to narrow down the sense in\nwhich fiction on the ordinary, intuitive understanding prompts\nimaginings we describe some work on make-believe or pretense in the\ncognitive sciences. As we will see, there are some clear points of\ncontact between this work and some of the views considered above. \n\nConsider in particular the popular \u201cmultiple models\u201d\ntheory according to which an agent engaging in make-believe entertains\na representational model\u2014the pretend (or, more\nbroadly, imaginary) model\u2014that is different\nfrom the representational model she normally\nuses\u2014the reality model. The reality model in this\nset-up represents how the agent believes things actually unfold, while\nthe pretend model represents how things unfold in an imaginary world,\na world of make-believe (Perner 1991). Nothing, however, prevents the\npretend model from also storing actual beliefs, as may happen with\nfictions that import representations of the real world.  The point is\nsimply that once they are stored in the pretend model, those beliefs\nhave to be evaluated with respect to the imaginary rather than the\nreal world. The pretend model thus becomes part of an offline\nreasoning mechanism in which beliefs are disconnected from actions\noccurring in the real world. In particular, such beliefs don\u2019t\nlead to the sort of actions that would result if they were part of an\nonline reasoning mechanism, which is what the reality model is\n(Nichols & Stich 2003).\n\nBut there is a problem with seeing the availability of a two-model\naccount as a sufficient condition for the relevant kind of\nmake-believe. There are people suffering from various clinical\nsyndromes who also activate distinct models of this kind, prompting\nthem to exhibit incoherent patterns of behavior. Thus, consider people\naffected by the Capgras syndrome. While saying that a close relative\nhas been replaced by an impostor, they also behave in a friendly\nmanner towards this \u201cimpostor\u201d. Such people are perhaps\nbest interpreted as people whose odd beliefs are not integrated into a\nsingle belief system (Young 2000).\n\nA friend of the two-model account may say that people affected in this\nway are to be classified differently from those engaging with fiction:\ntheir \u201cimaginary\u201d beliefs are not quarantined from their\n\u201creal\u201d ones. But note that the simultaneous yet distinct\nactivation of the imaginary and reality models also accounts for the\ncognitive situation of agents who are somehow\ndissociated\u2014subjects who experience a world of their own and\nstill do not lose their grip on the real world. Sleepwalkers are a\nclear case. A sleepwalker may mobilize both the reality model,\nallowing her to avoid obstacles while walking, and an imaginary model,\nin which she represents the world she is dreaming about. Despite this,\nshe is not engaged in make-believe (Meini & Voltolini 2010).\n\nOne way of answering this challenge is to invoke Leslie\u2019s\nidentification of fiction with metarepresentation (Leslie 1987). On\nthis view, the required quarantining of imaginary beliefs involves a\nmetarepresentational level. The difference between a subject who\nengages in make-believe and a dissociated subject lies in the fact\nthat the former acknowledges that the representations\nentertained in the pretend model are not to be lumped together with\nthe representations that she entertains in the reality model.\nFollowing a line of thought that can already be found in Vaihinger,\nwho originally drew a connection between fiction and awareness (1911\n[1924]: 80, 98\u20139), Lillard writes: \n\n\na pretender must be aware of the actual situation and the nonactual,\nrepresented one, or else (s)he is mistaken, not pretending. (2001:\n497) \n\n\nProponents of such a view construe this kind of awareness as a\nsecond-order representation that operates on first-order\nrepresentations; it involves a recognition that, insofar as the\nimaginary representations are stored in the pretend model, it\ncan\u2019t be inferred that they represent the real world. Note that\nCurrie himself moves in this direction when arguing that\nmetarepresenting is required for pretending, as a way of combining his\nintentionalist account of fiction with simulationist accounts (Currie\n1998).\n\nSome critics, however, think this idea is too demanding, that it\npresupposes too intellectualist a view of pretending and hence of\nfiction (see Perner 1991: 19\u201320, 35). For in order to have a\nmetarepresentation of a representation, one surely needs to represent\nit to oneself as a representation, and young children in\nparticular do not possess a notion of representation (1991:\n19\u201320, 35). Others think this criticism presupposes a disputable\nconceptualist account of representing, and hence also of\nmetarepresenting (Meini & Voltolini 2010). Perner himself\nrecognizes that merely simultaneously entertaining distinct\nrepresentations in different models is not sufficient for\nmake-believe, and suggests that the two models have to be integrated\ninto a single all-encompassing model which nests both the pretend and\nthe reality models. It is far from clear, however, that this account\nis any less intellectualist than the metarepresentational one that\nPerner criticizes, given the way it appeals to the idea of\nnesting. Leslie had already pointed out that we invoke a nesting of\nthis kind when, from outside of a fiction F and typically from\nthe perspective of reality, we speak of F itself when we say\n\u201cIn fiction F,\np\u201d (Leslie 1987). Doing so, however, requires possession\nof a notion that is even more conceptually demanding than the notion\nof representation, namely the notion of fiction itself, so this appeal\nto nesting should not be seen as unproblematic (Meini & Voltolini\n2010: 50). \n",
