Introduction\n\nIn the introduction to his recently completed translation of Wars\nof the Lord, Feldman suggests that the significance of Gersonides\nlies in his emphasis upon \u201creligious rationalism in\nJudaism.\u201d According to Feldman, we see a man who \u201chas\ntaken seriously the fact that he has reason, who believes that this\nfaculty is God-given, and who attempts to understand God with this\ninstrument\u201d (Wars, p. 52). Gersonides is the\nphilosopher who attempted to show that philosophy and Torah, that\nreason and revelation are co-extensive; he is a philosophical optimist\nwho believes that reason was fully competent to attain all the\nimportant and essential truths. Thus, according to Feldman, Gersonides\nis \u201ca most vigorous and consistent defender of human reason in\nreligion\u201d(Wars, p. 53).\n\nThis trust is reflected in Gersonides\u2019 introductory remarks to\nWars. There, Gersonides upholds the primacy of reason,\nattributing to Maimonides the position that \u201cwe must believe\nwhat reason has determined to be true. If the literal sense of the\nTorah differs from reason, it is necessary to interpret those passages\nin accordance with the demands of reason\u201d (Wars, p.\n98). Gersonides believes that reason and Torah cannot be in\nopposition: \u201cif reason causes to affirm doctrines that are\nincompatible with the literal sense of Scripture, we are not\nprohibited by the Torah to pronounce the truth on these matters, for\nreason is not incompatible with the true understanding of the\nTorah\u201d (ibid.). Thus reason is upheld as a criterion\nfor achieving truth.\n2. Biography\n\nGersonides left few letters and does not talk about himself in his\nwritings; nor is his life discussed at great length by his\ncontemporaries. Hence, what is known of his biography is sketchy at\nbest. Levi ben Gerson was born in 1288 in Provence and may have lived\nfor a time in Bagnol sur-Ceze. It is probable that his father was\nGershom ben Salomon de Beziers, a notable mentioned in medieval\nhistories. With the decline of Spanish Judaism in the thirteenth\ncentury, Provence quickly became the cultural center for Jewish\nintellectual activity. The popes in Avignon had a lenient policy\ntoward the Jews, whose creative life flourished, particularly in\nphilosophy and theology. Jewish philosophers did not have direct\naccess to the works of Aristotle, but Proven\u00e7al Jews learned of\nAristotle through the commentaries of Averroes, the twelfth-century\nSpanish Muslim philosopher. By the end of the thirteenth century these\ncommentaries had been translated from Arabic into Hebrew, and\nAverroes\u2019 thought, as well as that of Aristotle, was being\nintegrated into the mainstream of Jewish philosophy.\n\nGersonides may have married a distant cousin; it is not known whether\nhe had any offspring. Although Gersonides spoke Proven\u00e7al, his\nworks are all written in Hebrew, and all of his quotations from\nAverroes, Aristotle, and Moses Maimonides are in Hebrew as well. He\nmay have had a reading knowledge of Latin; he appears to manifest an\nawareness of contemporary Scholastic discussions. He might, however,\nhave learned of such discussions in oral conversations with his\nChristian contemporaries. Apart from several trips to Avignon,\nGersonides most likely resided his entire life in Orange. There is\nsome evidence that he may have followed the traditional occupation of\nhis family, moneylending. He died on 20 April 1344.\n\nIn addition to Averroes and Aristotle, Gersonides was influenced by\nMoses Maimonides, his greatest Jewish philosophical predecessor.\nGersonides\u2019 works can be seen as an attempt to integrate the\nteachings of Aristotle, as mediated through Averroes and Maimonides,\nwith those of Judaism. In Milhamot Ha-Shem he laid down the\ngeneral rule that \u201cthe Law cannot prevent us from considering to\nbe true that which our reason urges us to believe.\u201d His\nadherence to this principle is reflected throughout his work.\n3. Major Works\n\nIn her recent study of Gersonides\u2019 science, Glasner notes that\nGersonides \u201cstands out as one of the more creative and daring\nfigures in the medieval west\u201d (Glasner 2015, p. 13). What\ndistinguished Gersonides from his predecessors was his reliance upon\nand consummate knowledge of mathematics, coupled with his belief in\nthe accuracy of observations achieved by the use of good instruments.\nBecause of this rootedness in empirical observation bolstered by\nmathematics, Gersonides believed that he had the tools to succeed\nwhere others had failed. Only when he has resolved the problems in\nastronomy does Gersonides apply their findings to theological\ncosmology. As we shall see, Gersonides\u2019 theology and astronomy\nare deeply involved with each other.\n\nThis realist stance is stated in the context of examining\nal-Bitruji\u2019s astronomical proposals. Gersonides\u2019\ncontention is that \u201cno argument can nullify the reality that is\nperceived by the senses, for true opinion must follow reality but\nreality need not conform to opinion\u201d (Goldstein 1974, p. 24).\nThat Gersonides clearly considered his own observations to be the\nultimate test of his system is explicit from his attitude towards\nPtolemy. The importance of empirical observation cannot be\nunderestimated, he claims, and he values his own observations over\nthose of others. \u201cWe did not find among our predecessors from\nPtolemy to the present day observations that are helpful for this\ninvestigation except our own\u201d (Wars, V.1.3, p. 27), he\nsays in describing his method of collecting astronomical data. Often\nhis observations do not agree with those of Ptolemy, and in those\ncases he tells us explicitly that he prefers his own. Gersonides lists\nthe many inaccuracies he has found trying to follow Ptolemy\u2019s\ncalculations. Having investigated the positions of the planets, for\nexample, Gersonides encountered \u201cconfusion and disorder\u201d\nwhich led him to deny several of Ptolemy\u2019s planetary principles\n(Goldstein 1988, p. 386). He does warn his colleagues, however, to\ndissent from Ptolemy only after great diligence and scrutiny. Both\nJohn Buridan and Gersonides took the first steps in the 14th century\ntoward a principle of inertia; in the words of Touati, Gersonides was\nthe first to \u201chave a presentiment of the principle of\ninertia\u201d (see Touati 1973, pp. 103, 311). Glasner supports\nTouati\u2019s contention, claiming that \u201cGersonides had a\nrudimentary, not yet correct, but insightful understanding of the\nconcept of inertial motion.\u201d Gersonides was aware of its\nsignificance and used it in order to lay the basis for a new physics,\nan alternative to that of Aristotle. (see Glasner 2015, p 36) He did\nnot rely on a theory of impetus [as did Buridan], which turned out to\nbe an advantage.\n\nGersonides\u2019 scientific works comprise mathematics and astronomy.\nHis Sefer Ma\u2019aseh Hoshev (The Work of a\nCounter, 1321) is concerned with arithmetical operations and uses\nof a symbolic notation for numerical variables. Gersonides\u2019\nmajor scientific contributions were in astronomy; his works were known\nby his contemporaries and influenced later astronomers. His\nastronomical writings are contained primarily in book 5, part 1 of\nMilhamot Ha-Shem. In 136 chapters Gersonides reviews and\ncriticizes astronomical theories of the day, compiles astronomical\ntables, and describes one of his astronomical inventions. This\ninstrument, which he called Megalle \u2018amuqqot\n(Revealer of Profundities) and which was called Bacullus\nJacobi (Jacob\u2019s staff) by his Christian\ncontemporaries, was used to measure the heights of stars above the\nhorizon. The astronomical parts of Milhamot Ha-Shem were\ntranslated into Latin during Gersonides\u2019 lifetime. One of the\ncraters of the moon, Rabbi Levi, is named after him.\n\nGersonides was well known as a Halakhist, one who deals with the\nintricacies of Jewish law. From this respect, his greatest\ncontribution to Judaica was in the area of biblical commentary. His\ncommentary on the Book of Job, completed in 1325, proved to be one of\nhis most popular works and was one of the earliest Hebrew books to be\npublished (in Ferrara, 1477). The commentary, which complements book 4\nof Milhamot Ha-Shem, is concerned with the problem of divine\nprovidence. Each of the characters in the Book of Job represents a\ndifferent theory of divine providence; Gersonides\u2019 own position\nis a restatement of Elihu\u2019s theory that providence is not\ndirected to particulars but rather to groups of individuals, or\nuniversals.\n\nGersonides also wrote a logical treatise, Sefer Ha-heqesh\nHa-yashar (On Valid Syllogisms, 1319), in which he\nexamines problems associated with Aristotle\u2019s modal logic as\ndeveloped in the Prior Analytics. This treatise was translated into\nLatin at an early date, although Gersonides\u2019 name was not\nattached to it.\n\nGersonides\u2019 major philosophical work, Milhamot Ha-Shem,\nwas completed in 1329; it had been twelve years in the making. In 1317\nGersonides began an essay on the problem of creation. This problem,\nwhich has vexed Jewish philosophers since Philo Judaeus, had recently\nreceived elaborate treatment by Maimonides. Gersonides was\ndissatisfied with Maimonides\u2019 discussion and proposed to reopen\nthe issue. This project was soon laid aside, however, for he felt that\nit could not be adequately discussed without proper grounding in the\nissues of time, motion, and the infinite. By 1325 his manuscript had\ndeveloped to include discussion not only of creation but also of\nimmortality, divination, and prophecy. By 1328 it included a chapter\non providence as well. Books 5 and 6 were completed, by\nGersonides\u2019 own dating, by 1329.\n\nAs Isaac Husik has pointed out, Gersonides \u201chas no use for\nrhetorical flourishes and figures of speech \u2026 the effect upon\nthe reader is monotonous and wearisome.\u201d His style has been\ncompared to that of Thomas Aquinas and even of Aristotle in its use of\na precise, technical vocabulary which eschews examples. In\ncontradistinction to Maimonides, who introduced allegory, metaphor,\nand imprecise language into his work to convey the ambiguity of the\nsubject matter, Gersonides saw it as his function to elucidate the\nissues as clearly as possible. Gersonides is the first Jewish\nphilosopher to use this analytic, scholastic method.\n4. Major Themes in Milhamot Ha-shem\n\nIn the introduction to Milhamot, Gersonides specifies six\nquestions which he hopes to examine: Is the rational soul immortal?\nWhat is the nature of prophecy? Does God know particulars? Does divine\nprovidence extend to individuals? What is the nature of astronomical\nbodies? Is the universe eternal or created? Each question occupies a\nseparate book. Gersonides attempts to reconcile traditional Jewish\nbeliefs with what he feels are the strongest points in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. Although a synthesis of these systems is\nhis ultimate goal, philosophy often wins out at the expense of\ntheology.\n\nGersonides\u2019 attitude toward previous astronomers, coupled with\nhis faith in human reason, are reflected in his discussion of\ncreation. Maimonides went to great lengths to maintain that the topic\nof creation is beyond rational demonstration. Gersonides, on the other\nhand, devotes many chapters in Milhamot VI to proving that\nthe Platonic theory of creation out of an eternal formless matter is\nrationally demonstrable. The question of whether the universe was\ncreated or had existed from eternity had been treated by Maimonides in\nan ambiguous manner; scholars still disagree over whether Maimonides\nultimately upheld an Aristotelian, Platonic, or scriptural doctrine of\ncreation. Gersonides\u2019 position is unambiguously Platonic.\nGersonides argues that the world was created outside of time by a\nfreely willing agent. He must then decide whether the world was\nengendered ex nihilo or out of a preexistent matter. Arguing\nthat ex nihilo creation is incompatible with physical\nreality, he adopts a model drawn from Plato\u2019s Timaeus.\nGersonides interprets the opening of Genesis to refer to two types of\nmatter. Geshem is the primordial matter out of which the\nuniverse was created; not capable of motion or rest, it was\ncharacterized by negation and was inert and chaotic. This matter is\nidentified with the primeval waters described in Genesis.\nHomer is prime matter, in the Aristotelian sense of a\nsubstratum always aligned with form. It contains within itself the\npotentiality to receive forms but is not an ontologically independent\nentity. Gersonides compares this matter to darkness: just as darkness\nis the absence of light, this matter represents the absence of form or\nshape. As noted by Glasner (2015) and Freudenthal (1987), this notion\nof a body that does not preserve its shape offered several important\nadvantages. First, the space between the spheres, which is subject to\ncontinuous change, is filled by the body that does not preserve its\nshape, and so transmission can be explained by contact. Second, in the\ncontext of his theory of creation, this amorphous body is a remnant of\nthe pre-existent entity (thou va-vohu) from which God shaped the\nworld. On this basis Gersonides argues that the world was created out\nof an eternally preexistent matter.\n\nGersonides\u2019 cosmology forms the backdrop of the other books of\nMilhamot. His predecessor Maimonides had claimed that no\nvalid inference can be drawn from the nature of the sublunar sphere to\nthat of the superlunar sphere. Gersonides, however, rejects the\nmetaphysical bite to the distinction, and argues that inasmuch as both\nspheres contain material elements, what we know about creation is\nbased on astronomy, and astronomy is fundamentally no different a\nhuman science than physics. Astronomy can only be pursued as a science\nby \u201cone who is both a mathematician and a natural philosopher,\nfor he can be aided by both of these sciences and take from them\nwhatever is needed to perfect his work\u201d (Wars, V.1.1,\np. 23). Gersonides sees the ultimate function of astronomy to\nunderstand God. Astronomy, he tells us, is instructive not only by\nvirtue of its exalted subject matter, but also because of its utility\nin the other sciences. By studying the orbs and stars, we are led\nineluctably to a fuller knowledge and appreciation of God. Astronomy\nthus functions as the underpinning of the rest of the work.\n\nGersonides\u2019 discussion of immortality of the soul in book 1 must\nbe understood against the backdrop of a notoriously difficult passage\nin Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul, book 3, chapter 5\n(430a22\u201325). In this passage Aristotle seems to postulate the\nexistence of an active intellect which is separable from the passive\nintellect and which is primarily responsible for the intellectual\nactivities of the human soul. But what is the relation between the\nactive and passive intellects, and which, if either, is immortal?\nGersonides states and rejects three positions that elucidate a version\nof the unity of intellect. The import of Gersonides\u2019 critique of\nhis predecessors can be reduced to three main issues. From a\ntheological perspective, it is clear that the doctrine of unity of\nintellect threatens the notion of personal immortality. For if all\nhumans share the same intellect, then upon physical death, all that\nremains of the person is an unindividualized intellect.\nEpistemologically, the doctrine is unable to account for how it is\nthat two (or more) knowers can entertain contrary items of knowledge;\nor, more stringently, how one person can be mistaken about something\nanother person knows. And from a metaphysical perspective, the main\nproblem is how to individuate this separate intellect when it is\nmanifested in many individuals: for if it is individuated materially\non the basis that individual bodies differ, then the substance is no\nlonger incorporeal or separate. As Feldman has pointed out, on this\ntheory an incorporeal substance is either a unique member of a species\nor is not a member of a species at all (Wars, I.4, p.\n79).\n\nGersonides avoids these untoward consequences by adopting the position\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias. Gersonides agrees with Alexander of\nAphrodisias that immortality consists in the intellectual perfection\nof the material intellect. He disagrees with Alexander, however, over\nthe precise nature of this intellectual attainment. For Alexander\n(according to Gersonides) had claimed that immortality is achieved\nwhen the intellect acquires knowledge of the Agent Intellect (hence\nthe term \u201cacquired intellect\u201d is introduced). Immortality\nis thus understood by Alexander to be a form of conjunction between\nthe Agent and acquired intellects. \u201cThey [the followers of\nAlexander] maintain that the material intellect is capable of\nimmortality and subsistence when it reaches that level of perfection\nwhere the objects of knowledge that it apprehends are themselves\nintellects, in particular the Agent Intellect\u2026[material\nintellect] is immortal when it is united with the Agent\nIntellect\u201d (Wars, I.8, p. 170).\n\nGersonides rejects this notion of conjunction, however, and replaces\nit with a model of immortality according to which it is the content of\nknowledge of the acquired intellect that matters. When the content of\nthe acquired intellect mirrors the rational ordering of the Agent\nIntellect, immortality is achieved. What is the content of this\nknowledge? The Agent Intellect must possess complete knowledge of the\nsublunary world; that is, it \u201ccontains a conception of the\nrational order obtaining in all individuals\u201d (Wars,\nI.4, p. 136). The anti-Platonic tenor of this position is emphasized\nwhen Gersonides describes in more detail what it is that the Agent\nIntellect knows. For according to Gersonides, the knowledge of the\nAgent Intellect must be grounded in the domain of particulars. Thus\nGersonides\u2019 position avoids the epistemological difficulties\napparent in a realist ontology. Inasmuch as the material intellect\nreflects the knowledge inherent in the Agent Intellect, and inasmuch\nas this knowledge is grounded in particulars, it follows that humans\ncan have knowledge of particulars; in this acquisition of knowledge\nlies immortality.\n\nBooks 2 to 4 focus on the relation between God and the world. The\ngeneral problem is whether God\u2019s knowledge is limited to\nnecessary states of affairs or extends to the domain of contingency as\nwell. If the former, then God could not be said to have knowledge of\nhumans, and so divine providence would not be efficacious. But if God\ndoes know contingents\u2014in particular, future contingent\nevents\u2014then it would appear that human freedom is curtailed by\nGod\u2019s prior knowledge of human actions. The problem of the\napparent conflict between divine omniscience and human freedom was\ndiscussed by many medieval philosophers. Gersonides does not follow\nthe majority opinion on this issue: rather than claim that God does\nknow particulars and that this knowledge somehow does not affect human\nfreedom, Gersonides argues that God knows particulars only in a\ncertain sense. In an apparent attempt to mediate between the view of\nAristotle, who said that God does not know particulars, and that of\nMaimonides, who said that he does, Gersonides holds that God knows\nparticulars only insofar as they are ordered. That is, God knows that\ncertain states of affairs are particular, but he does not know in what\ntheir particularity consists. God knows individual persons, for\nexample, only through knowing the species humanity.\n\nWhereas Maimonides claimed that God\u2019s knowledge does not render\nthe objects of his knowledge necessary, Gersonides maintains that\ndivine knowledge precludes contingency. To retain the domain of\ncontingency, he adopts the one option open to him: namely, that God\ndoes not have prior knowledge of future contingents. According to\nGersonides, God knows that certain states of affairs may or may not be\nactualized. But insofar as they are contingent states, he does not\nknow which of the alternatives will be the case. For if God did know\nfuture contingents prior to their actualization, there could be no\ncontingency in the world.\n\nIn book 2, in an attempt to explain how prophecies are possible in a\nsystem which denies the possibility of knowledge of future\ncontingents, Gersonides claims that the prophet does not receive\nknowledge of particular future events; rather his knowledge is of a\ngeneral form, and he must instantiate this knowledge with particular\nfacts. What distinguishes prophets from ordinary persons is that the\nformer are more attuned to receive these universal messages and are in\na position to apply them to particular circumstances.\n\nA further dilemma surrounds the doctrine of divine providence. If God\ndoes not have knowledge of future contingents, how can he be said to\nbestow providence on his creatures? This problem is discussed by\nGersonides both in his commentary on Job and in book 4 of\nMilhamot. In both texts he argues that providence is general\nin nature; it primarily appertains to species and only incidentally to\nparticulars of the species. God, for example, does not know the\nparticular individual Levi ben Gerson and does not bestow particular\nprovidence on him. Rather, inasmuch as Levi ben Gerson is a member of\nthe species humanity and the species philosopher, he is in a position\nto receive the providential care accorded to those groups.\n\nFor Gersonides, the issues of prophecy, omniscience and providence are\ndeveloped against the backdrop of astrological determinism. Like many\nthinkers of the late Middle Ages, Gersonides had to confront two\nopposing sets of traditions: on the one hand, attacks by religious\nauthorities (e.g. Augustine\u2019s attack in City of God;\nMaimonides\u2019 letters) on the grounds that astrology compromised\nhuman free will; on the other hand, the wide scale acceptance of\nastrology from the 12th century on. In the 12th and\n13th centuries, most Jewish and Christian philosophers\nsupported natural astrology, the view that the celestial bodies affect\nsublunar life and existence to some extent at least. That the sun and\nmoon both affect natural cycles and events on earth is unequivocal and\nrepresents a classic paradigm of natural astrology. The calculations\nof natural astrology overlapped those of astronomy, and could be\nutilized for practical purposes such as fixing the calendar. According\nto astrologers, each planet and sign of the zodiac has its own\ncharacter, power and attributes. Inasmuch as the characters of the\nplanets and the signs of the zodiac are opposed to each other, they\nare engaged in a perpetual power struggle. Thus the position of the\nplanets and their interrelation with the signs of the zodiac, regulate\nthe fate of both individuals and nations. Astrological predictions\ncould apply, then to both individuals as well as to the history of\nIsrael and its place in universal history.\n\nAn attack upon astrology as a whole belonged to a much larger\nconflict, that between the roles of reason and faith. Thus, astrology\nshould not be situated within the context of magic or the occult, but\nrather should be construed as a robust contender to science. Based on\na precise scientific astronomy, astrology was a science accepted from\nthe second to the seventeenth centuries. On the scientific level it\nprevailed almost uncontested until and including Newton.\n5. Gersonides\u2019 Astrological Determinism\n\nEven a summary reading of Gersonides\u2019 major philosophical work\nevinces an explicit \u201cbelief in\u201d astrology. Gersonides\ndevelops his astral determinism in two contexts: in book II of\nWars he interweaves astrological motifs into his discussion\nof divine providence and prophecy, while in Book V astrology occupies\na central role in the context of his cosmological speculations. His\nmajor concern is the extent to which the stars and planets exerted an\ninfluence over human events in general, or more particularly, over\nthose actions that entail human choice. Judicial astrology was based\non the assumption that the entire world of nature was governed and\ndirected by the movement of the heavens and the celestial bodies, and\nthat man, as an animal naturally generated and living in the world of\nnature, was also naturally under their rule.\n\nLangermann emphasizes the teleological nature of astrology for\nGersonides, its chief merit being its ability to provide\n\u201cteleological explanations for the wide variety of stellar\nmotions that are observed to take place\u201d (Wars, Vol\nIII, p. 506). This teleology is reflected in V.2 ch 7\u20139 where,\nafter listing 27 problems raised by the heavenly bodies, Gersonides\nsuggests that only astrological considerations can furnish\nsatisfactory replies; it is astrology alone that can explain the\nconnection between the two realms. It is worth noting that on this\npoint, Gersonides disagrees with Maimonides over the ultimate purpose\nof the celestial bodies. For Maimonides it is not possible that a\ngreater entity, the heavens, would exist for the sake of the sublunar\nuniverse. Gersonides disagrees, maintaining that it is not\ninappropriate that the more noble exist for the less noble. The stars,\nhe argues, exist for the sake of things in the sublunar world\n(Wars, V.2.3, p. 194). More explicitly, the heavenly bodies\nare designed for the benefit of sublunar existence, and they guarantee\nthe perpetuation of life on earth.\n\nThis teleology is spelled out in Milhamot II, in which\nGersonides is concerned to explain how divine knowledge operates, and\nto what extent divine foreknowledge of future contingents affects\nhuman choice. His major thesis is that divine knowledge is predicated\nto a great extent upon knowledge of the heavenly bodies, which bodies\nare in turn \u201csystematically directed toward his [man\u2019s]\npreservation and guidance so that all his activities and thoughts are\nordered by them\u201d (Wars, II.2, p. 33). In support of\nthis teleological cosmology, Gersonides presents an extensive argument\nto the effect that the celestial bodies have a purpose. On the basis\nof this argument Gersonides concludes that from the perspective of the\nteleological structure of the universe, we can understand why the\nheavenly bodies behave the way they do. This teleology is reflected by\na \u201claw, order and rightness\u201d in the universe, implying the\nexistence of an intellect that orders the nature of things: \u201cyou\nsee that the domain of the spheres provides, in the best way possible,\nfor the sub-lunar world\u201d (Wars, V.2.5, p. 137).\n\nAs we have seen, the existence of a connection between celestial and\nterrestrial events was admitted by most everybody, but not everybody\nagreed on the nature of this connection. Gersonides as well must\naccount for the type of relation obtaining between celestial and\nterrestrial events. Having articulated the ordering power of the\nastral bodies, Gersonides describes in Milhamot V.3 the\nseparate intellects and the spheres that they move. The main\ncharacteristic of the astral bodies is their luminosity\n(nitzutz). This luminosity affects their actions and effects\n(Wars, V.2.3, p. 137). Gersonides is very much aware of the\nproblem of accounting for how the astral bodies can affect actions at\na distance. The sun, for example, functions as a paradigm for action\nat a distance. Once we understand, Gersonides claims, how the activity\nof heating reaches earth from the sun, we can understand how the\nparticular activities of the other stars reach the sublunar realm as\nwell. By explaining the efficient cause as the light or radiation of\nthe stars, Gersonides can account for weak or strong effects. As\nLangermann has pointed out, Gersonides\u2019 account furnishes the\nbasis for the introduction of astrological causation into natural\nphilosophy.\n\nIn Milhamot V.2.8 Gersonides lays out six astrological\nprinciples that affect his general cosmological scheme. These can be\nsummarized as follows. First, each astral body exercises a different\ninfluence specific to it. Second, astral influence depends upon its\nposition in the zodiac (galgal hamazalot). Third, the longer\na star stays in one place in the zodiac, the greater its effect\nbecause of the strength of its luminosity. Fourth, astral influence is\ndependent upon its inclination to the north or to the south; its\neffect will be strongest when it is in the middle, as evidenced by the\nsun, whose heat is strongest when it is at the Tropic of Cancer as\nopposed to being at the Tropic of Capricorn. Fifth, the greater the\nradiation or luminosity of a star, the stronger its influence. And\nfinally, the closer to earth a star is, the stronger will be its\ninfluence (Wars, V.2.8, p. 207\u20138). These principles\nfunction as the underpinnings of his general astronomy as well.\n\nIn light of the original problems posed by astrology above, let me\npropose that the most important piece of Levi\u2019s astrology is\nwhat Langermann calls the variety of the heavens (ribbui\nhayahasim). Gersonides must be able to account for individual\nvariety in the sublunar realm. Inasmuch as stellar radiation is the\nmeans by which stellar influences are conveyed, the wide variety of\nmixtures of stellar radiation guarantees a sufficient variety of\n\u201cinfluences\u201d on terrestrial processes. The movers emanate\nfrom God who is construed as the \u201cFirst Separate\nIntellect\u201d (Wars, V.3.8, p. 272). They are ordered in a\nrational system that governs the sublunar domain. If there were no one\nfirst intellect, Gersonides argues, the rational order we see in the\nheavens would be the result of chance, which is unacceptable. The\nagent intellect thus functions as the link between these celestial\nbodies and human affairs. The kinds of information it transmits are of\nan astronomical type, as evidenced in the following example: \u201cit\n[the agent intellect] knows how many revolutions of the sun, or of the\ndiurnal sphere, or of any other sphere [have transpired] from the time\nat which someone, who falls under a particular pattern, had a\nparticular level of good or ill fortune\u2026\u201d (Wars,\nII.6, p. 64). The agent intellect serves as the repository of\ninformation communicated by the heavenly bodies. The patterns revealed\nin this communication between agent intellect and diviner (astrologer,\nprophet) are from the heavenly bodies which themselves are endowed\nwith intellects and so \u201capprehend the pattern that derives from\nthem.\u201d Each mover apprehends the order deriving from the\nheavenly body it moves, and not patterns that emanate from other\nheavenly bodies. As a result, the imaginative faculty receives the\n\u201cpattern inherent in the intellects of the heavenly bodies from\nthe influence deriving from them.\u201d This influence derives from\nthe position of the heavenly bodies \u201cby the ascendent degree or\nthe dominant planet [in a particular zodiacal position]\u201d\n(Wars, II.6, p. 64). However, inasmuch as the heavenly bodies\ndo not jointly cooperate with one another (lo yishtatfu) in\nthis process, it is possible for the communication to be\nmisconstrued.\n\nOf course, as we all know, astrologers often err in their predictions.\nAstrological errors can be due to several factors. In general,\nGersonides claims, we know very little of the order of the heavenly\nbodies. \u201cIn general, it is impossible for man to know the\n[complete] truth of the order of the sublunar world. This is nicely\nillustrated in astrology, where frequently false predictions are made.\nAll the more so is it impossible for man to know the general order of\nthe sublunar world by means of its causes so that his knowledge would\nbe perfect\u201d (Wars, I.12, p. 219). In some cases, the\ninformation is not transmitted clearly. Why is it that certain\ncommunications are received more clearly than others? A\nconstitutionally perfect imaginative faculty receives information from\nboth dominant and weak heavenly bodies. By \u2018weak\u2019,\nGersonides means that certain celestial bodies are too weak both to\nbring about events on earth as well as to transmit information about\nthese events. Hence he concludes that information about the future\nemanates \u201cfrom the dominant body in the particular proper face\n(panim) in which it has dominance but not from any of the\nattending planets (ha-meshartim)\u201d (Wars, II.7,\npp. 69\u201370). But to constitutionally imperfect imaginative\nfaculties, the information received is only from the dominant heavenly\nbodies. Hence the overall quality of the information received will\ndiffer in the two cases. More specifically, because of the difficulty\nof obtaining the necessary positions of these bodies by observation,\nastrologers are often unable to verify their data. Furthermore, since\nthe zodiacal position of a heavenly body at any given time is only\nrepeated once in many thousands of years, astrologers have no access\nto the repeatability of those events that would be required to verify\ntheir knowledge. Furthermore, humans simply do not have sufficient\nknowledge about the heavenly bodies.\n\nThe final cause for error has to do with human free will: as we have\nseen above, our intellect and choice \u201chave the power to move us\ncontrary to that which is determined by the heavenly bodies\u201d\n(Wars, II.2, p. 34). Although he admits that on occasion\nhuman choice is able to contravene the celestial bodies, nevertheless\nthis intervention is rare, and true contingency is a rare state of\naffairs indeed in Gersonides\u2019 ontology. Gersonides presents an\nargument to show that human choice guided by reason can subvert the\ncelestial bodies despite their general ordering of our lives. The\nheavenly bodies can order human affairs either by virtue of their\ndifference of position in the heavens, or from the difference of the\nbodies among themselves. Astral bodies, however, will affect different\nindividuals in different ways; they can also affect an individual\ndifferently at different times; and finally, two or more bodies can\naffect a single individual, resulting in multiple influences that can\nhave contrary effects, echoing the scholastic phrase,\n\u201csapiens dominabitur astris [the wise man will be ruled\nby the stars]\u201d. Gersonides notes that humans can contravene\nthese effects: God has provided humans with \u201cthe intellectual\ncapacity (sekhel ba\u2019al takhlit) that enables us both to\nact contrary to what has been ordered by the heavenly bodies and to\ncorrect, as far as possible, the [astrally ordained] misfortunes that\nbefall us\u201d (Wars, II.2, p. 35). Nevertheless, he\nassures us that whatever happens by chance is \u201cdetermined and\nordered according to this type of determinateness and order\u201d\n(Wars, II.2, p. 34). Outdoing even Plato\u2019s hierarchical\nstructuring in Republic IV, Gersonides argues that the\nultimate perfection and ordering of society is due to astrological\ninfluence.\n\nThe commensurability of the motion of heavenly bodies raises an\nadditional concern, having to do with the uniqueness of individual\nbeings and the doctrine of eternal return. Gersonides\u2019 immediate\n13th century predecessors Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera and Judah\nben Solomon ha-Cohen discussed this issue against the backdrop of\nAristotle\u2019s Gen. Animalia. In Gen. Animalia,\nAristotle had established a connection between the life spans and\ngestations periods of animals and the revolutions of the sun and moon\n(Gen. Anim., IV.10, 777b17\u2013778a10). Thus the\nrevolutions of the sun measure not only time but also produce the\nalternating periods of growth and decay. Eschatological predictions\nare thus tied to the cyclicity of the heavenly bodies. Gersonides did\nnot [to our knowledge] indulge in eschatological and millennial\npredictions. In fact, Gersonides wrote only one astrological text that\nhas survived, a prognostication based on the conjunction of Saturn and\nJupiter to take place in March 1345. Gersonides himself died in 1344,\na year before the event in question. As Goldstein has demonstrated,\nthis conjunction was predicted already by Ibn Ezra, and repeated by\nAbraham Bar Hiyya in his Megillat ha-Megalleh where the\nconjunction was associated with a date of messianic significance that\nwould supposedly take effect in 1358 (Goldstein 1990, p. 3). The\nconjunction was codified by Levi ben Abraham ben Hayyim in his\nencyclopedia Livyat Hen, indicating an awareness in the\nJewish community of the messianic significance of this conjunction.\nAccording to North, Ibn Ezra was the earliest scholar to record one of\nthe seven methods for the setting up of the astrological houses;\nGersonides then computed the astrological houses for the\nprognostication of 1345 according to Ibn Ezra\u2019s method. (See\nNorth 1986, p. 25.) Goldstein suggests that as the date 1345\napproached, the Papal court might have become interested as well in\nthe conjunction. We do know that Gersonides\u2019 text was translated\ninto Latin with the aid of his brother shortly after Gersonides\u2019\ndeath in 1344.\n\nIn his prognostication, Gersonides predicts that there will be\n\u201cextraordinary evil with many wars, visions and miraculous\nsigns;\u201d \u201cDiseases and death, and the evil will endure for\na long time;\u201d \u201cthe absence of good, pleasure and happiness\nfor most of the inhabited world;\u201d \u201cthe spilling of much\nblood and increasing enmity, jealousy, strife, famine, various\ndiseases, drought and dearth\u201d (Goldstein 1990). The Black\nDeath, which arrived in Europe in 1347, was thus provided with\nnumerous astrological credentials. The official statement of the\nmedical faculty of the University of Paris, presented to the king in\n1348, reported on the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the house\nof Aquarius on 20 March 1345, which was seen to spread \u201cdeath\nand disaster\u201d. It is not hard to see how the conjunction of 1345\ncame to be associated with the Black Death.\n6. Ethical Views\n\nGersonides is not known for his ethical views; as we have seen, most\nof his philosophical writings engage matters in the natural sciences.\nIn his biblical commentaries, however, Gersonides focuses on a number\nof ethical issues. To take one example, Gersonides\u2019 commentary\non Songs of Songs is imbued with an extended discussion of\nhuman felicity. In this work, he claims that because of their inherent\nweakness and epistemological imperfections, most human beings are\nincapable of achieving felicity: \u201conly very few individuals can\nacquire even a large measure of it.\u201d (Gersonides, Songs of\nSongs, 6) For these masses, the Torah and its commandments\nfunction as the best guide to moral perfection. But if immortality is\npredicated on intellectual knowledge, and if philosophers such as\nMaimonides and Gersonides have argued that many individuals are\npsycho-physically incapable of embarking on such a rigorous and\nphilosophical course of study, does it follow that not all humans can\nachieve intellectual perfection: is the road the same, and open, to\nall? And is there only one road to ultimate felicity, or are there\nmany routes?\n\nHorwitz claims that this theme is apparent in Gersonides\u2019\nbiblical commentaries: \u201ca central role of Ralbag\u2019s biblical\ncommentaries is the desire to help his readers attain eternal\nintellectual felicity through knowledge of the truth.\u201d (Horwitz 2006,\np. 124) Nowhere is this emphasis seen more clearly than in\nGersonides\u2019 commentary to Song of Songs. Ostensibly the\nSong of Songs describes the love affair and desires of a\nshepherd for a maiden. Generations of commentators saw in the work an\nallegory of the relation between God and the people Israel.\nGersonides, however, provides a philosophical reading of the work that\nincorporates two sets of subsidiary dialogues, first between the human\nmaterial intellect and the Active Intellect, and second between the\nfaculties of the soul and the material intellect. Gersonides spells\nout the import of these discussions in his introduction to the work.\nHe first lays down the premise that \u201cman\u2019s ultimate felicity\nresides in cognizing and knowing God to the extent that is possible\nfor him.\u201d (Song of Songs, 5) Such knowledge is achieved\nthrough observation of the state of existing things in the natural\nuniverse, that is, through the beings that God has created and caused.\nKnowledge of God, therefore, is predicated on knowledge of the natural\norder.\n\nGersonides then unpacks the various levels of enlightenment that he\nfinds in Song of Songs, moving from mathematics, to physics,\nastronomy and finally metaphysics. In this way, Gersonides emphasizes\nthe natural sciences, in particular physics, as a propadeutic to\nmetaphysics. Gersonides is clear that the science of physics builds\nupon moral knowledge derived from Scripture: \u201cthis science is\nimpossible for one who is not strongly settled on the true views from\nthe perspective of Torah and speculation.\u201d (Gersonides Song of\nSongs, 11). Gersonides then unpacks the various allegories and\nsymbolic representations in the work, all of which point to the goal\nof ultimate felicity as the union with God via the Active\nIntellect.\n7. Conclusion\n\nGersonides\u2019 philosophical ideas went against the grain of\ntraditional Jewish thought; he also challenged scholastic thought.\nGlasner suggests that unlike his Christian peers who studied and\ntaught at a university, Gersonides\u2019 academic profile as rooted\nin applied mathematics and astronomy allowed him to leave metaphysics\nbehind. He offered a serious critique of Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nmotion, thus freeing himself as well from \u201cthe grip of\nAristotelian physics, and even laid down a basis for an alternative\nunderstanding of motion\u201d (Glasner 2015, p. 106). Gersonides\nreflects the following characteristics: first, his writings\ndemonstrate a fundamental interplay and harmony between astrological\nand theological beliefs. It is clear that the appeal of astrology lay\nin the fact that it offered useful information, while it looked and\noperated like a science. Even the critics of astrology had to agree\nthat the heavens exerted a real influence upon terrestrial events. The\ncomplexity of the rules of astrology and internal disagreement among\nits followers served to increase the respect accorded to the science.\nFailures did not cause the astrologer to lose faith, just as failures\namong modern physicists do not lead to loss of faith in science.\nGersonides believed that life on earth had a meaning, and that\nterrestrial events had an order. Astrology was a means of ascertaining\nthat meaning. Gersonides\u2019 views on prophecy, providence,\nfree-will and evil reflected ingredients of this philosophical\ndeterminism. Whereas his commentaries occupied a central place in\nJewish theology, his philosophical work was rejected. Jewish\nphilosophers such as Hasdai Crescas and Isaac Abrabanel felt obliged\nto subject his works to lengthy criticism. Only in recent years has\nGersonides received his rightful place in the history of philosophy.\nAs scholars have rediscovered his thought and have made his corpus\navailable to a modern audience, Gersonides is once again appreciated\nas an insightful, ruthlessly consistent philosopher.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriWor\">Principal Works</a>", "<a name=\"EdiEng\">Editions in English</a>", "<a name=\"SelSecLit\">Selected Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriWor\">Principal Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Sefer Ha-heqesh Ha-yashar</em> (On Valid Syllogisms, written\n1319); translated into Latin as <em>Liber Syllogismi</em>\n<em>Recti</em>.", "<em>Sefer Ma\u2019aseh Hoshev</em> (<em>The Work of a\nCounter</em>, written 1321; edited and translated into German by\nGerson Lange (Frankfurt am Main: Golde, 1909).", "<em>Perush \u2018al Sefer lyob</em> (<em>Commentary on Job</em>,\nwritten 1325; Ferrara, 1477).", "<em>Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem</em> (<em>The Wars of the Lord</em>,\nwritten 1329; Riva di Trento, 1560; Leipzig, 1866; Berlin, 1923).", "<em>Perush \u2018al Sefer Ha-Torah</em> (<em>Commentary on the\nPentateuch</em>, written 1329\u20131338; Venice, 1547; Jerusalem,\n1967).\n</ul>\n<h3>"], "<a name=\"EdiEng\">Editions in English</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>The Commentary of Levi ben Gerson on the Book of Job</em>,\ntranslated by Abraham L.
