    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n3. Metaphysics\n\nFor Ramon Llull, God necessarily exists, and he is the beginning of\nall existing things. However, under the influence of the negative\ntheology proposed by Dionysius the Areopagite, Llull considers God to\nbe incomprehensible due to the limitations of human nature to\nunderstand Him. This inability establishes an initial difficulty with\ngeneral knowledge, for there would be no means to access the ultimate\nsource of existence, truth, and knowledge, according to Llull\u2019s\nideas.\n\nThe means by which this difficulty is solved, according to Llull, is\nto recognize the cognitive value of the predicates that describe the\npositive qualities of the things created by God as a reflection of the\ndivine qualities, thus serving as a way to know God by his\nattributes.\n\nWhen we talk about the goodness or the greatness of something, we\nexpress a quality in things that, for Llull, corresponds to a divine\nattribute as well. These attributes are called Dignities, although\nthey are sometimes referred to as \u201creasons\u201d or\n\u201cvirtues\u201d. Llull defines \u201cDignity\u201d in\nGay\u00e1\u2019s (2008: 466) words as \u201cGod\u2019s\nperfection, or attributes that in God, and only in God, reach their\nmost perfect realization\u201d.\n\nDignities are varied in number throughout Llull\u2019s work. Among\nthem we find infinity (infinitas), eternity\n(aeternitas), unity (unitas), wisdom\n(sapientia), which are common to the Christian tradition, as\nwell as others such as magnitude (magnitudo), virtue\n(virtus), mercy (misericordia), or simplicity\n(simplicitas), which correspond to attributes that we\nrecognize in ourselves (quoad nos) or in relation to other\ncreatures. These attributes are, according to Mayer (2016), the means\nthrough which men can perceive the work of God in creation so that\nthey can then project it onto divinity.\n\nThese \u201cDignities\u201d designate divine properties and are,\nthus, the starting point for Llull\u2019s thought, and at the same\ntime, his ultimate object of reflection. We find them enunciated in\nthe different versions of the Ars in\n \u201cFigure A\u201d.\n",
