    "main_text": "\n\nThe first centuries after \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha\u2019s death saw\nthe rise of multiple schools of thought and teacher lineages within\nthe Buddhist community as it spread throughout the Indian\nsubcontinent. These new forms of scholarly monastic communities had\ndistinct theoretical and practical interests and, in their efforts to\norganize, interpret, and reexamine the Buddha\u2019s scattered\nteachings, they developed a particular system of thought and method of\nexposition called Abhidharma (Pali, Abhidhamma). The Sanskrit term\nabhidharma seems to derive from the expression\n\u201cconcerning (abhi) the teaching(s) (Skt.,\ndharma, Pali, dhamma).\u201d For the Buddhist\nexegetical tradition, however, the term means approximately\n\u201chigher\u201d or \u201cfurther\u201d teaching, and it refers\nboth to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement\nand to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of\nBuddhist thought. This body of literature includes the third of the\n\u201cthree baskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the\nAbhidharma-pi\u1e6daka (Pali,\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka), its commentaries, and later\nexegetical texts.\n\nBoth as an independent literary genre and a branch of thought and\ninquiry, Abhidharma is to be contrasted with S\u016btr\u0101nta, the\nsystem of the Buddha\u2019s discourses (Skt., s\u016btras,\nPali, suttas). Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that\nare colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined\nto ensure analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive\nin its efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist\npractice of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of\nsentient experience. It does so by analyzing conscious\nexperience\u2014and in this sense one\u2019s\n\u201cworld\u201d\u2014into its constituent mental and physical\nevents (Skt., dharm\u0101, Pali, dhamm\u0101,\nhereafter dharmas/dhammas respectively). The overarching\ninquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple\ncategories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of\ntheir manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as\nthe \u201cdharma theory.\u201d The exhaustive\ninvestigations into the nature and interaction of dharmas\nextended into the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology,\nand generated doctrinal controversies among different Buddhist\nschools. The Abhidharma analysis of and methods of argumentation about\nthese controversies provided the framework of reference and defined\nthe agenda for the Mah\u0101y\u0101na schools of Madhyamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. As a distinct doctrinal movement, then, Abhidharma\nhad a remarkable impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and gave rise\nto Buddhist systematic philosophy and hermeneutics.\n",
