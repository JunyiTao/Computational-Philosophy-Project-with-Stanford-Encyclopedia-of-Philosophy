Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence\n\nIn earlier sections, we reviewed some problems that arise from\ntreating classical (non-evolutionary) game theory as a normative\ntheory that tells people what they ought to do if they wish to be\nrational in strategic situations. The difficulty, as we saw, is that\nthere seems to be no one solution concept we can unequivocally\nrecommend for all situations, particularly where agents have private\ninformation. However, in the previous section we showed how appeal to\nevolutionary foundations sheds light on conditions under which utility\nfunctions that have been explicitly formulated by theorists can\nplausibly be applied to groups of people, leading to game-theoretic\nmodels with plausible and stable solutions. So far, however, we have\nnot reviewed any actual empirical evidence from behavioral\nobservations or experiments. Has game theory indeed helped empirical\nresearchers make new discoveries about behavior (human or otherwise)?\nIf so, what in general has the content of these discoveries been?\n\nIn addressing these questions, an immediate epistemological issue\nconfronts us. There is no way of applying game theory \u2018all by\nitself\u2019, independently of other modelling technologies. Using\nterminology standard in the philosophy of science, one can test a\ngame-theoretic model of a phenomenon only in tandem with\n\u2018auxiliary assumptions\u2019 about the phenomenon in question.\nAt least, this follows if one is strict about treating game theory\npurely as mathematics, with no empirical content of its own. In one\nsense, a theory with no empirical content is never open to testing at\nall; one can only worry about whether the axioms on which the theory\nis based are mutually consistent. A mathematical theory can\nnevertheless be evaluated with respect to empirical\nusefulness. One kind of philosophical criticism that has\nsometimes been made of game theory, interpreted as a mathematical tool\nfor modelling behavioral phenomena, is that its application always or\nusually requires resort to false, misleading or badly simplistic\nassumptions about those phenomena. We would expect this criticism to\nhave different degrees of force in different contexts of application,\nas the auxiliary assumptions vary.\n\nSo matters turn out. There is no interesting domain in which\napplications of game theory have been completely uncontroversial.\nHowever, there has been generally easier consensus on how to use game\ntheory (both classical and evolutionary) to understand non-human\nanimal behavior than on how to deploy it for explanation and\nprediction of the strategic activities of people. Let us first briefly\nconsider philosophical and methodological issues that have arisen\naround application of game theory in non-human biology, before\ndevoting fuller attention to game-theoretic social science.\n\nThe least controversial game-theoretic modelling has applied the\nclassical form of the theory to consideration of strategies by which\nnon-human animals seek to acquire the basic resource relevant to their\nevolutionary tournament: opportunities to produce offspring that are\nthemselves likely to reproduce. In order to thereby maximize their\nexpected fitness, animals must find optimal trade-offs among various\nintermediate goods, such as nutrition, security from predation and\nability to out-compete rivals for mates. Efficient trade-off points\namong these goods can often be estimated for particular species in\nparticular environmental circumstances, and, on the basis of these\nestimations, both parametric and non-parametric equilibria can be\nderived. Models of this sort have an impressive track record in\npredicting and explaining independent empirical data on such strategic\nphenomena as competitive foraging, mate selection, nepotism, sibling\nrivalry, herding, collective anti-predator vigilance and signaling,\nreciprocal grooming, and interspecific mutuality (symbiosis). (For\nexamples see\n Krebs and Davies 1984,\n Bell 1991,\n Dugatkin and Reeve 1998,\n Dukas 1998, and\n Noe, van Hoof and Hammerstein 2001.)\n On the other hand, as\n Hammerstein (2003)\n observes, reciprocity, and its exploitation and metaexploitation, are\nmuch more rarely seen in social non-human animals than game-theoretic\nmodeling would lead us to anticipate. One explanation for this\nsuggested by Hammerstein is that non-human animals typically have less\nability to restrict their interaction partners than do people. Our\ndiscussion in the previous section of the importance of correlation\nfor stabilizing game solutions lends theoretical support to this\nsuggestion.\n\nWhy has classical game theory helped to predict non-human animal\nbehavior more straightforwardly than it has done most human behavior?\nThe answer is presumed to lie in different levels of complication\namongst the relationships between auxiliary assumptions and phenomena.\n Ross (2005a)\n offers the following account. Utility optimization problems are the\ndomain of economics. Economic theory identifies the optimizing\nunits\u2014economic agents\u2014with unchanging preference fields.\nIdentification of whole biological individuals with such agents is\nmore plausible the less cognitively sophisticated the organism. Thus\ninsects (for example) are tailor-made for easy application of Revealed\nPreference Theory (see\n Section 2.1).\n As nervous systems become more complex, however, we encounter animals\nthat learn. Learning can cause a sufficient degree of permanent\nmodification in an animal\u2019s behavioral patterns that we can\npreserve the identification of the biological individual with a single\nagent across the modification only at the cost of explanatory\nemptiness (because assignments of utility functions become\nincreasingly ad hoc). Furthermore, increasing complexity confounds\nsimple modeling on a second dimension: cognitively sophisticated\nanimals not only change their preferences over time, but are governed\nby distributed control processes that make them sites of competition\namong internal agents\n (Schelling 1980;\n Ainslie 1992,\n Ainslie 2001).\n Thus they are not straightforward economic agents even at a\ntime. In setting out to model the behavior of people using any part of\neconomic theory, including game theory, we must recognize that the\nrelationship between any given person and an economic agent we\nconstruct for modeling purposes will always be more complicated than\nsimple identity.\n\nThere is no sharp crossing point at which an animal becomes too\ncognitively sophisticated to be modeled as a single economic agent,\nand for all animals (including humans) there are contexts in which we\ncan usefully ignore the synchronic dimension of complexity. However,\nwe encounter a phase shift in modeling dynamics when we turn from\nasocial animals to non-eusocial social ones. (This refers to animals\nthat are social but that don\u2019t, like ants, bees, wasps, termites\nand naked mole rats, achieve cooperation thanks to fundamental changes\nin their population genetics that make individuals within groups into\nnear clones. Some known instances are parrots, corvids, bats, rats,\ncanines, hyenas, pigs, raccoons, otters, elephants, hyraxes,\ncetaceans, and primates.) In their cases stabilization of internal\ncontrol dynamics is partly located outside the individuals,\nat the level of group dynamics. With these creatures, modeling an\nindividual as an economic agent, with a single comprehensive utility\nfunction, is a drastic idealization, which can only be done with the\ngreatest methodological caution and attention to specific contextual\nfactors relevant to the particular modeling exercise. Applications of\ngame theory here can only be empirically adequate to the extent that\nthe economic modeling is empirically adequate.\n\nH. sapiens is the extreme case in this respect. Individual\nhumans are socially controlled to an extreme degree by comparison with\nmost other non-eusocial species. At the same time, their great\ncognitive plasticity allows them to vary significantly between\ncultures. People are thus the least straightforward economic agents\namong all organisms. (It might thus be thought ironic that they were\ntaken, originally and for many years, to be the exemplary instances of\neconomic agency, on account of their allegedly superior\n\u2018rationality\u2019.) We will consider the implications of this\nfor applications of game theory below.\n\nFirst, however, comments are in order concerning the empirical\nadequacy of evolutionary game theory to explain and predict\ndistributions of strategic dispositions in populations of agents. Such\nmodeling is applied both to animals as products of natural selection\n (Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998),\n and to non-eusocial social animals (but especially humans) as\nproducts of cultural selection\n (Boyd and Richerson 1985;\n Young 1998). There are two main kinds of auxiliary assumptions one\nmust justify, relative to a particular instance at hand, in\nconstructing such applications. First, one must have grounds for\nconfidence that the dispositions one seeks to explain are (either\nbiological or cultural, as the case may be)\nadaptations\u2014that is, dispositions that were selected\nand are maintained because of the way in which they promote their own\nfitness or the fitness of the wider system, rather than being\naccidents or structurally inevitable byproducts of other adaptations.\n(See\n Dennett 1995\n for a general discussion of this issue.) Second, one must be able to\nset the modeling enterprise in the context of a justified set of\nassumptions about interrelationships among nested evolutionary\nprocesses on different time scales. (For example, in the case of a\nspecies with cultural dynamics, how does slow genetic evolution\nconstrain fast cultural evolution? How does cultural evolution feed\nback into genetic evolution, if it feeds back at all? For a masterful\ndiscussion of these issues, see\n Sterelny 2003.)\n Conflicting views over which such assumptions should be made about\nhuman evolution are the basis for lively current disputes in the\nevolutionary game-theoretic modeling of human behavioral dispositions\nand institutions. This is where issues in evolutionary game theory\nmeet issues in the booming field of behavioral-experimental\ngame theory. We will therefore first consider the second field before\ngiving a sense of the controversies just alluded to, which now\nconstitute the liveliest domain of philosophical argument in the\nfoundations of game theory and its applications.\n",
