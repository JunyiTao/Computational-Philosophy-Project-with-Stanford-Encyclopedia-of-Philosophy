    "main_text": "Constitution || Constitution Through Parity and Wide Computationalism\n5.2 Constitution Through Parity and Wide Computationalism\n\n\nApart from coupling arguments, some philosophers, e.g., Clark and\nChalmers (1998) and Clark (2008), have defended the idea that\ncognitive systems include constituents outside the brain by appeal to\na\nparity principle, whereas Wilson (2004) invokes the idea of\nwide computationalism. The arguments are similar, both seeking\nto reveal how a functionalist commitment to mental states or processes\nlicenses the possibility of cognitive processes that extend beyond the\nbrain.\n\n\nThe parity principle says \u201c[i]f, as we confront some task, a\npart of the world functions as a process which, were it done in the\nhead, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the\ncognitive process, then that part of the world is\u2026part of the\ncognitive process\u201d (Clark 2008, 222). As illustration, Clark and\nChalmers (1998) compare the occurrent beliefs of Otto, who is\nafflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to those of Inga, who has a\nnormal biological brain. Otto keeps a notebook containing information\nof the sort that would be stored in the hippocampus of a normally\nfunctioning brain. When Inga wants to visit MoMA, she pulls from her\nbiological memory the information that MoMA is on 53rd\nSt. which prompts her to take a subway to the destination. When Otto\nhas the same desire, he consults his notebook in which is written\n\u201cMoMA is on 53rd St.\u201d, which in turn induces\nhis trip to that location. By stipulation, the representation of\nMoMA\u2019s location in Otto\u2019s notebook plays an identical\nfunctional role to the representation in Inga\u2019s brain. Hence, by\nthe parity principle, the notebook entry is a memory\u2014an\noccurrent belief about the location of MoMA. The notebook is thus home\nto constituents of many of Otto\u2019s cognitive processes.\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Wilson (2004) discusses a person who wishes to\nsolve a multiplication problem involving two large\nnumbers. Calculating the product \u201cin the head\u201d is a\npossibility, but solving the problem with the aid of pencil and paper\nwould be much easier. In the latter case, Wilson claims that the brain\n\u201coffloads\u201d onto the paper some of the work that it would\notherwise have to do on its own. Crucial to Wilson\u2019s argument is\nthe idea that solving the multiplication problem is a computational\nprocess and that computational processes are not confined to\nparticular spatial regions. When the multiplication problem is solved\n\u201cin the head\u201d the computational processes occur within the\nbrain alone. But some of the steps in the computation could as well\ntake place outside the head, on a piece of paper, in which case a\ncomputational process might partly occur outside the head. There is,\nthen, a parity in the two processes, whether the particular\ncomputations are internal or external to the agent. To the extent that\nthis is plausible, one can find additional support for\nConstitution.\n\n\nMost criticism of extended cognition has been aimed at Clark and\nChalmers\u2019s original proposal, although because Wilson\u2019s\nposition is similar, it is as much victim to these criticisms insofar\nas they succeed. Among the most vocal critics are Adams and Aizawa\n(2001; 2008; 2009; 2010), who argue that extended cognitive systems\nlike those involving Otto and his notebook or a person doing\nmultiplication with a paper and pencil, cannot actually be cognitive\nbecause they fail to satisfy two \u201cmarks\u201d of the cognitive.\nThe first mark is that \u201ccognitive states must involve intrinsic,\nnon-derived content\u201d (Adams and Aizawa 2001, 48). The second is\nthat cognitive systems must display processes of sufficient uniformity\nto fall within the domain of a single science (Adams and Aizawa\n2010).\n\n\nThe intrinsic content criterion assumes a distinction between content\nthat is derived from human thought, as the content of the word\n\u2018martini\u2019 is derived from thoughts about martinis, and\ncontent that arises \u201con its own\u201d without having to depend\non some other contentful state for its origin. The thought\nmartini, for instance, presumably does not (or need not)\nderive from other contentful states but arises from some naturalistic\nprocess involving relationships between brain states and martinis\n(relationships that it is the business of a naturalistic theory of\ncontent to specify). Words, maps, signs, and so on possess derived,\nnon-intrinsic content whereas thoughts have intrinsic, non-derived,\noriginal content. Granting this distinction and its importance\nfor identifying genuinely cognitive states and processes, Adams and\nAizawa dismiss the plausibility of extended cognition on the grounds\nthat things like notebook entries and numerals written on paper do not\nhave intrinsic content.\n\n\nClark (2010) responds to this objection, in part pressing Adams and\nAizawa to clarify how much intrinsic content must be present in a\nsystem for the system to qualify as cognitive. After all, brains, if\nanything, are cognitive systems but not all activity occurring in a\nbrain involves states or processes with intrinsic\ncontent. Accordingly, Clark wonders, why should the fact that some\nelements of the Otto+ notebook system, because they lack\nintrinsic content, preclude the system from counting as cognitive?\n\n\nAdams and Adams propose in response that \u201cif you have a process\nthat involves no intrinsic content, then the condition rules that the\nprocess is non-cognitive (2010, 70). However, this response leaves\nopen whether Otto+ notebook constitutes a cognitive system. Because\nOtto\u2019s brain does indeed contain states and processes that\n\u201cinvolve\u201d intrinsic content\u2014states and processes by\nwhich the notebook entries are read and understood and used to guide\nbehavior\u2014Clark can readily accept Adams and Aizawa\u2019s\nstipulation. Some of the Otto+ notebook system involves intrinsic\ncontent, some does not, and the cognitive system as a whole\nincorporates both these elements.\n\n\nThe second mark of the mental that Adams and Aizawa take to preclude\nsystems like Otto+ notebook from counting as cognitive raises issues\nconcerning the identification of scientific domains. If one supposes,\nreasonably enough, that the objects, processes, properties, etc. that\nfall into the domain of a particular science do so in virtue of sharing\nparticular features, then one should expect the same for the domain of\ncognitive science. The parts, properties, and activities taking place\nin brains do seem to share important features, features that explain\nhow it is possible to identify brains in newly discovered species, how\nthey differ from igneous rocks, and so on. But now suppose that\ncognitive systems can be extended in ways that Clark, Chalmers and\nWilson have argued. Such systems would now contain constituents that\ncould not possibly fit into the domain of a single science. Extended\nsystems might include notebooks, or pencil and paper, or tools of just\nabout any sort. \u201c[F]or this reason,\u201d Adams and Aizawa\nargue, \u201ca would-be brain-tool science would have to cover more\nthan just a multiplicity of causal processes. It would have to cover a\ngenuine motley\u201d (2010, 76).\n\n\nRupert (2004) shares a similar concern, noting that the processes by\nwhich Otto and Inga locate MoMA differ so considerably that it makes\nno sense to treat them as of a kind\u2014as within the domain of a\nsingle science. Additionally, Rupert argues, there is no good reason\nto regard the various implements that combine with brain activity to\nbe constituents of a cognitive system rather than simply tools that\ncognitive systems use to ease the processing they require to complete\nsome task. Instead of insisting that cognitive systems extend, Rupert\nasks, why not regard them as seeking ways to embed themselves among\ntools that make their jobs easier? An axe does not become part of a\nperson when she uses it to chop down a tree, why does a notebook\nbecome part of cognitive system when a brain uses it to locate MoMA? A\nsensible conservatism, Rupert thinks, speaks in favor of seeing\ncognitive systems as embedded in environments that allow ready use of\ntools to reduce their workloads, rather than as constituted, in part,\nby such tools. The hypothesis that cognitive systems use tools\n\u201cis significantly less radical\u201d (2004, 7) than the\nhypothesis that tools are constituents of cognitive systems and would\nseem to provide adequate explanations for all the phenomena that\ninitially motivated the idea of extended cognition.\n\n\nFrom Clark\u2019s perspective, however, there is nothing motley, as\nAdams and Aizawa claim, about the brain+ tool systems that he\nbelieves constitute a legitimate kind for scientific\ninvestigation. Moreover, the processes by which Otto and Inga locate\nMoMA are not, as Rupert insists, vastly different. Once one steps back\nform the physical particularities of the constituents of extended\ncognitive systems and focuses just on the functional, computational,\nroles they play, such systems are identical, or very similar, to\nwholly brain-bound cognitive systems.\n\n\nSimilarly, Clark would deny Rupert\u2019s claim that the hypothesis\nof embedded cognition can equally well save the phenomena that the\nhypothesis of extended cognition was intended to capture and do so\nwhile requiring less revision of existing ideas about how cognitive\nsystems operate. A brain, Clark claims, is \u201c\u2019cognitively\nimpartial\u2019: It does not care how and where key operations are\nperformed\u201d (2008, 136). Rupert\u2019s conservatism in fact\nreflects a misunderstanding\u2014it conceives of brains as having the\nfunction of cognizing, which is true in a sense, but more accurate\nwould be a description of the brain\u2019s function as directing the\nconstruction of cognizing systems\u2014some (many?) of which include\nconstituents outside the brain proper (see also Wilson and Clark\n2009).\n\n\nFinally, Shapiro (2019b; 2019c) has suggested that the parity and\nwide-computationalist defenses of Constitution do not sit well with\nother commitments of embodied cognition. As mentioned, such defenses\nrest on a functionalist theory of cognition (for more on\n functionalism, see the entry on\n functionalism).\n Functionalism may well justify the claim that states and processes\noutside the brain can be identical to states and processes internal to\na brain (can stand in a relation of parity towards them), which in\nturn grounds the possibility that cognitive systems can contain\nnon-neural constituents. But, Shapiro argues, this strategy for\ndefending extended cognition seems contrary to the central theme of\nembodied cognition. Motivating the embodied turn in cognitive science\nis the idea that bodies are somehow essential to cognition. But the\nparity and wide-computational arguments for extended cognition entail\njust the opposite\u2014important for cognition are computational\nprocesses, and because computational processes are \u201chardware\nneutral\u201d, one need not consider the specifics of bodies in order\nto describe them. Thus, it appears, arguments in favor of extended\ncognition succeed to the extent that bodies, qua bodies, do\nnot matter to cognition.\n",
