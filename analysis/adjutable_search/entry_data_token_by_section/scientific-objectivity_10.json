    "main_text": "Objectivity as Freedom from Personal Biases || Measurement and Quantification\n4.1 Measurement and Quantification\n\nMeasurement is often thought to epitomize scientific objectivity, most\nfamously captured in Lord Kelvin\u2019s dictum\n\n\nwhen you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre\nand unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you\nhave scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of\nscience, whatever the matter may be. (Kelvin 1883, 73)\n\n\nMeasurement can certainly achieve some independence of perspective.\nYesterday\u2019s weather in Durham UK may have been \u201creally\nhot\u201d to the average North Eastern Brit and \u201cvery\ncold\u201d to the average Mexican, but they\u2019ll both accept that\nit was 21\u00b0C. Clearly, however, measurement does not result in a\n\u201cview from nowhere\u201d, nor are typical measurement results\nfree from presuppositions. Measurement instruments interact with the\nenvironment, and so results will always be a product of both the\nproperties of the environment we aim to measure as well as the\nproperties of the instrument. Instruments, thus, provide a\nperspectival view on the world (cf. Giere 2006).\n\nMoreover, making sense of measurement results requires interpretation.\nConsider temperature measurement. Thermometers function by relating an\nunobservable quantity, temperature, to an observable quantity,\nexpansion (or length) of a fluid or gas in a glass tube; that is,\nthermometers measure temperature by assuming that length is a function\nof temperature: length = \\(f\\)(temperature). The function \\(f\\) is not\nknown a priori, and it cannot be tested either (because it\ncould in principle only be tested using a veridical\nthermometer, and the veridicality of the thermometer is just what is\nat stake here). Making a specific assumption, for instance that \\(f\\)\nis linear, solves that problem by fiat. But this\n\u201csolution\u201d does not take us very far because different\nthermometric substances (e.g., mercury, air or water) yield different\nresults for the points intermediate between the two fixed points\n0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C, and so they can\u2019t all expand\nlinearly.\n\nAccording to Hasok Chang\u2019s account of early thermometry (Chang\n2004), the problem was eventually solved by using a \u201cprinciple\nof minimalist overdetermination\u201d, the goal of which was to find\na reliable thermometer while making as few substantial assumptions\n(e.g., about the form for \\(f\\)) as possible. It was argued that if a\nthermometer was to be reliable, different tokens of the same\nthermometer type should agree with each other, and the results of air\nthermometers agreed the most. \u201cMinimal\u201d doesn\u2019t mean\nzero, however, and indeed this procedure makes an important\npresupposition (in this case a metaphysical assumption about the\none-valuedness of a physical quantity). Moreover, the procedure\nyielded at best a reliable instrument, not necessarily one that was\nbest at tracking the uniquely real temperature (if there is such a\nthing).\n\nWhat Chang argues about early thermometry is true of measurements more\ngenerally: they are always made against a backdrop of metaphysical\npresuppositions, theoretical expectations and other kinds of belief.\nWhether or not any given procedure is regarded as adequate depends to\na large extent on the purposes pursued by the individual scientist or\ngroup of scientists making the measurements. Especially in the social\nsciences, this often means that measurement procedures are laden with\nnormative assumptions, i.e., values.\n\nJulian Reiss (2008, 2013) has argued that economic indicators such as\nconsumer price inflation, gross domestic product and the unemployment\nrate are value-laden in this sense. Consumer-price indices, for\ninstance, assume that if a consumer prefers a bundle \\(x\\) over an\nalternative \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) is better for her than \\(y\\), which is\nas ethically charged as it is controversial. National income measures\nassume that nations that exchange a larger share of goods and services\non markets are richer than nations where the same goods and services\nare provided by the government or within households, which too is\nethically charged and controversial.\n\nWhile not free of assumptions and values, the goal of many measurement\nprocedures remains to reduce the influence of personal biases and\nidiosyncrasies. The Nixon administration, famously, indexed social\nsecurity payments to the consumer-price index in order to eliminate\nthe dependence of security recipients on the flimsiest of party\npolitics: to make increases automatic instead of a result of political\nnegotiations (Nixon 1969). Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison refer to\nthis as mechanical objectivity. They write:\n\n\nFinally, we come to the full-fledged establishment of mechanical\nobjectivity as the ideal of scientific representation. What we find is\nthat the image, as standard bearer of is objectivity is tied to a\nrelentless search to replace individual volition and discretion in\ndepiction by the invariable routines of mechanical reproduction.\n(Daston and Galison 1992: 98)\n\n\nMechanical objectivity reduces the importance of human contributions\nto scientific results to a minimum, and therefore enables science to\nproceed on a large scale where bonds of trust between individuals can\nno longer hold (Daston 1992). Trust in mechanical procedures thus\nreplaces trust in individual scientists.\n\nIn his book Trust in Numbers, Theodore Porter pursues this\nline of thought in great detail. In particular, on the basis of case\nstudies involving British actuaries in the mid-nineteenth century, of\nFrench state engineers throughout the century, and of the US Army\nCorps of Engineers from 1920 to 1960, he argues for two causal claims.\nFirst, measurement instruments and quantitative procedures originate\nin commercial and administrative needs and affect the ways in which\nthe natural and social sciences are practiced, not the other way\naround. The mushrooming of instruments such as chemical balances,\nbarometers, chronometers was largely a result of social pressures and\nthe demands of democratic societies. Administering large territories\nor controlling diverse people and processes is not always possible on\nthe basis of personal trust and thus \u201cobjective\nprocedures\u201d (which do not require trust in persons) took the\nplace of \u201csubjective judgments\u201d (which do). Second, he\nargues that quantification is a technology of distrust and weakness,\nand not of strength. It is weak administrators who do not have the\nsocial status, political support or professional solidarity to defend\ntheir experts\u2019 judgments. They therefore subject decisions to\npublic scrutiny, which means that they must be made in a publicly\naccessible form.\n\nThis is the situation in which scientists who work in areas where the\nscience/policy boundary is fluid find themselves:\n\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences has accepted the principle that\nscientists should declare their conflicts of interest and financial\nholdings before offering policy advice, or even information to the\ngovernment. And while police inspections of notebooks remain\nexceptional, the personal and financial interests of scientists and\nengineers are often considered material, especially in legal and\nregulatory contexts.\n\nStrategies of impersonality must be understood partly as defenses\nagainst such suspicions [\u2026]. Objectivity means knowledge that\ndoes not depend too much on the particular individuals who author it.\n(Porter 1995: 229)\n\n\nMeasurement and quantification help to reduce the influence of\npersonal biases and idiosyncrasies and they reduce the need to trust\nthe scientist or government official, but often at a cost.\nStandardizing scientific procedures becomes difficult when their\nsubject matters are not homogeneous, and few domains outside\nfundamental physics are. Attempts to quantify procedures for treatment\nand policy decisions that we find in evidence-based practices are\ncurrently transferred to a variety of sciences such as medicine,\nnursing, psychology, education and social policy. However, they often\nlack a certain degree of responsiveness to the peculiarities of their\nsubjects and the local conditions to which they are applied (see also\n section 5.3).\n\nMoreover, the measurement and quantification of characteristics of\nscientific interest is only half of the story. We also want to\ndescribe relations between the quantities and make inferences using\nstatistical analysis. Statistics thus helps to quantify further\naspects of scientific work. We will now examine whether or not\nstatistical analysis can proceed in a way free from personal biases\nand idiosyncrasies\u2014for more detail, see the entry on\n philosophy of statistics.\n",
