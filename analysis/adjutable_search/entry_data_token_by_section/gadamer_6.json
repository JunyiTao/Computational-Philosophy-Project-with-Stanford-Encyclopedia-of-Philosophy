    "main_text": "Philosophical Hermeneutics || The Linguisticality of Understanding\n3.3 The Linguisticality of Understanding\n\nThe basic model of understanding that Gadamer finally arrives at in\nTruth and Method is that of dialogue or\nconversation. A conversation involves an exchange between\nconversational partners that seeks agreement about some matter at\nissue; consequently, such an exchange is never completely under the\ncontrol of either conversational partner, but is rather determined by\nthe matter at issue. Conversation always takes place in language and\nsimilarly Gadamer views understanding as always linguistically\nmediated. Since both conversation and understanding involve coming to\nan agreement, so Gadamer argues that all understanding involves\nsomething like a common language, albeit a common language that is\nitself formed in the process of understanding itself (and that, one\nmight argue, is also constantly formed and reformed in that very\nprocess). In this sense, all understanding is, according to Gadamer,\ninterpretative, and, insofar as all interpretation involves the\nexchange between the familiar and the alien, so all interpretation is\nalso translative. Gadamer\u2019s commitment to the linguisticality of\nunderstanding also commits him to a view of understanding as\nessentially a matter of conceptual articulation. This does not rule\nout the possibility of other modes of understanding, but it does give\nprimacy to language and conceptuality in hermeneutic experience.\nIndeed, Gadamer takes language to be, not merely some instrument by\nmeans of which we are able to engage with the world, but as instead\nthe very medium for such engagement. We are \u2018in\u2019 the world\nthrough being \u2018in\u2019 language. This emphasis on the\nlinguisticality of understanding does not, however, lead Gadamer into\nany form of linguistic relativism. Just as we are not held inescapably\ncaptive within the circle of our prejudices, or within the effects of\nour history, neither are we held captive within language. Language is\nthat within which anything that is intelligible can be comprehended,\nit is also that within which we encounter ourselves and others. In\nthis respect, language is itself understood as essentially dialogue or\nconversation. Like Wittgenstein, as well as Davidson, Gadamer thus\nrejects the idea of such a thing as a \u2018private\nlanguage\u2019\u2014language always involves others, just as it\nalways involves the world.\n\nGadamer claims that language is the universal horizon of hermeneutic\nexperience; he also claims that the hermeneutic experience is itself\nuniversal. This is not merely in the sense that the experience of\nunderstanding is familiar or ubiquitous. The universality of\nhermeneutics derives from the existential claim for hermeneutics that\nHeidegger advanced in the 1920s and that Gadamer made into a central\nidea in his own thinking. Hermeneutics concerns our fundamental mode\nof being in the world and understanding is thus the basic phenomenon\nin our existence. We cannot go back \u2018behind\u2019\nunderstanding, since to do so would be to suppose that there was a\nmode of intelligibility that was prior to understanding. Hermeneutics\nthus turns out to be universal, not merely in regard to knowledge,\nwhether in the \u2018human sciences\u2019 or elsewhere, but to all\nunderstanding and, indeed, to philosophy itself. Philosophy is, in its\nessence, hermeneutics. Gadamer\u2019s claim for the universality of\nhermeneutics was one of the explicit points at issue in the debate\nbetween Gadamer and Habermas (see Ormiston & Schrift [eds.] 1990);\nit can also be seen as, in a certain sense, underlying the engagement\nbetween Gadamer and Derrida (see Michelfelder & Palmer [eds.]\n1989), although in Derrida\u2019s case this consisted in a denial of\nthe primacy of understanding, and the possibility of agreement, on\nwhich hermeneutics itself rests.\n",
