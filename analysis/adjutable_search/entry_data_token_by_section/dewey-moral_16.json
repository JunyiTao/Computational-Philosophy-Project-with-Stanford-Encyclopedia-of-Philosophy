    "main_text": "Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous || Theories of the Good (Teleological Theories)\n4.1 Theories of the Good (Teleological Theories)\n\nWe have already seen that Dewey casts the distinction between the\napparent and the real good in terms of what is valued immediately in\nimpulse and unreflective habit, and what is valued reflectively as an\nobject of intelligent desire. Dewey insisted on the primacy of the\nreflective method of inquiry over settling on fixed answers to\nquestions about the good. This can be seen in his critiques and\nmethodological reinterpretations of the three types of theory of\ngoodness dominant today: hedonism, ideal (objective list) theories,\nand informed desire theory.\n\nHedonism supposes that the value of acts can be reduced to the\nquantity of pleasure and pain they produce. Estimating such values\nrequires that we be able to break down the pleasures and pains of\ndifferent activities and experiences into simple identical units, and\nthen sum them up again. This theoretical demand outruns the holistic\nand complex character of our experiences of pleasure and pain (LJP\n40\u20131). Pleasures and pains in reflective individuals are\ninextricably bound up with what Dewey called \u201cideational\u201d\nfactors \u2014 that is, with articulate conceptions of what they are\ntaking pleasure in. They are therefore not pure sensory units but\nalready contain elements of judgment or appraisal. Critical among\nthese are considerations of the consequences of prizing certain things\nfor one\u2019s own moral character. Since we form our character by\ncultivating habits of valuing some things over others, and we prize\nand appraise character itself, we cannot simply take current pleasures\nas given (E 193\u20134; LJP 41\u20132). Good and bad people take\npleasure in different things. Such facts can give us reason to\ncultivate different tastes from those we currently have.\n\nAlthough hedonism fails as a theory that gives us a fixed end, it does\ncontain a methodological insight. Nothing is good that cannot be\ndesired. All desire contains an element of enjoyment or liking. Hence,\npleasure can be seen as a sign of the good, as evidence of what is\nvaluable. Nevertheless, what makes desire a sound guide to the good is\nthe fact that it incorporates foresight and reflection on the wider\nconsequences of acting on it, not just that it incorporates a liking\nof its object (E 195\u20136).\n\nIdeal or objective list theories attempt to harmonize conflicting\ndesires not, as hedonism does, by reducing them all to a common\ndenominator, but by systematically fitting them together into an ideal\nor plan of life. Dewey argued that people construct ideals that make\nsense in view of their particular social circumstances. For example,\nideals of material or political advancement make sense of the\nstrivings of business people and politicians. Such ideals have, at\nbest, only contextual validity and cannot be prescribed as fixed ends\nfor all people. There can no more be a single best way of life than\nthere can be an ideal house for all times and places. To suppose that\nthere is forecloses the possibility of imagination inventing something\neven better. Yet, ideals serve a highly important function for\nindividuals, if they are considered as hypotheses about how one should\nlive that one can test in experiences of living in accordance with\nthem. So understood, ideals are tools for discovering evidence about\nthe good (LE 59\u201368, 229\u201330; E 185, 189\u201391,\n202\u2013210).\n\nInformed desire theories of the good, which define the good in terms\nof what an individual would desire if fully informed, come closest to\nDewey\u2019s own account. Dewey spoke of the good as the object of\ndesires of which we approve in calm, informed reflection (E 208, 212).\nYet Dewey\u2019s aims differ from that of most of today\u2019s\ninformed desire theorists. The latter tend to accept as fixed the\ncharacter of the individual whose good is being judged, and alter only\nthe individual\u2019s cognitive capacities and beliefs so as to read\noff the good for the individual from what his cognitively enhanced\nself wants. This commits the same error that Dewey charged against\nhedonism, of omitting critical appraisal of one\u2019s own character\nas an important factor in determining what one ought to desire. In\nidentifying the good with the objects of approved desires, Dewey\nhighlighted the importance of character to identifying the good.\nBefore we can endorse a desire, we need to ask whether we, or an\nimpartial observer, could approve of someone who had it (E\n239\u201347). The good is what good people \u2014 those possessing\nforesight and wide sympathies \u2014 desire. Dewey also resisted the\nconversion of a method of inquiry into a fixed criterion of value.\nThere is never an end to inquiry \u2014 no such thing as complete\ninformation \u2014 because circumstances are always changing and\nimagination constructs new possibilities for living (E 213). Nor does\nthe projection of desires we would have if we reached an end to\ninquiry offer a recognizable vision of human life. Fully informed\npeople do not desire more information. But education, inquiry, and\nindividual development in light of new discoveries are constitutive\ngoods of human life. The desire to skip to the end to see what is\nultimately valuable is a desire to skip human life, as if the process\nof learning through living were merely a means and not prized in\nitself (HNC 194\u2013202). What, in light of inquiry, we reflectively\ndesire, and approve of desiring, is evidence of what is good. But it\nis always defeasible in light of further inquiry.\n",
