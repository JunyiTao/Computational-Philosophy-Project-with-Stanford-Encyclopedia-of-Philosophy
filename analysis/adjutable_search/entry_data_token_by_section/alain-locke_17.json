    "main_text": "Philosophy of Race || Social or Cultural Conceptions of Race\n6.3 Social or Cultural Conceptions of Race\n\nLocke\u2019s social conception of race is a proto-social\nconstructionist account of race. Race, for him, is a\ncultural-historical phenomenon and not a natural kind distinction.\nRace, for Locke, is culture; or conversely, culture is race. The\ncultural conception views race as a learned socially inherited\nphenomenon. Culturally conceived, a race is a transactionally\nconstituted, and inherently transformational, subcultural variant, not\nfixed by biological determinants. Race for Locke is the characteristic\ndifferentiation of culture-type perpetuated through social heredity.\nLocke states that \u201c[r]ace in the vital and basic sense is simply\nand primarily the culture-heredity, and that in its blendings and\ndifferentiations is properly analyzed on the basis of conformity to or\nvariance from culture-type.\u201d (Locke, 1989, 192) Locke\u2019s\nview of social race implies that there are further distinctions to\nmake within current racial categories. Many groups commonly regarded\nas one race constitute several different races.\n\nLocke held that race was in point of fact a social and cultural\ncategory rather than a biological one. For this reason he developed\nthe notion of ethnic race or culture group. By ethnic race, I take\nLocke to mean a peculiar set of psychological and affective responsive\ndispositions, expressed or manifested as cultural traits, socially\ninherited and able to be attributed through historical\ncontextualization to a specifiable group of people. The concept of\nethnic race is a way of preserving the demonstrated distinctiveness of\nvarious groupings of human beings in terms of characteristic traits,\nlifestyles, forms of expression; without resulting to the\nscientifically invalidated notion of biological race.\n\u201cRace,\u201d Locke argues \u201cwould have been regarded as\nprimarily a matter of social [as opposed to biological]\nheredity,\u201d if only the science of his day had reached a more\ntenable understanding of the relationship of race to culture which\nwould likely have resulted from focusing more on the ethnic; rather\nthan, anthropological factors. The distinctiveness of a given race\nwould be understood as the result of \u201cthe selective\npsychological \u201cset\u201d of established cultural\nreactions\u201d (CRASC 191).\n\nThe notion of ethnic race is better able to capture the myriad\ndifferences between culture groups in terms of the actual social,\ncultural and historical conditions that give rise to such variation,\nand without the scientifically indefensible reliance on biological\nfactors. On this view, race is no longer thought to be the progenitor\nof culture; instead race is understood to be a cultural product. Locke\nheld that the more objective analysis of culture he advocated would\nlikely result in the development over time of distinctive\nculture-types for which it may prove possible to work out some\nprinciple of development or evolution. This he thought might\neventually make it possible to develop \u201ca standard of value for\nrelative culture grading\u201d (CRASC 194).\n\nNearly every culture is highly composite; consisting as most due in\nthe union of various social and historical influences; moreover, every\nethnic group in the unique outcome of a specific social history. A\nmore scientific understanding of man replaces the abstract artifice of\nbiological race, and requires that we deal with concrete culture-types\nwhich are frequently complex amalgamations of supposed races united\nprincipally by entrenchment of customary reactions, standardized\npractices, traditional forms of expression and interaction, in sum,\nthe specific history of a given people in a particular place. It is\nnoteworthy and perhaps illuminating of Locke's conception of ethnic or\nsocial race that the groupings of human persons formerly thought to\nconstitute \u201craces\u201d in the biological sense such as\n\u201cNegro,\u201d \u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d\nare in fact each composed of several different social or ethnic races.\nOn Locke's view there are many so-called \u201cNegro,\u201d\n\u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d races. This revised\nunderstanding of culture constitutes in Locke's estimation a\nfundamental paradigm shift in the study of human cultures \u201d[s]o\nconsiderable\u2026[in] emphasis and meaning that at times it does\nseem that the best procedure would be to substitute the term\nrace the term culture group\u201c (CRASC 194).\n\nLocke quickly notes while the notion of race has been invalidated as\nan explanation of culture groups understood as totalities, race does\nhelp to explain various cultural components within a given culture.\n\u201cRace operates as tradition,\u201d Locke noted, \u201cas\npreferred traits and values,\u201d changes in these aspects of\nculture in a distinctive way by a subset of a culture group\nconstitutes \u201cethnic remoulding\u201d (CRASC 195). Race becomes\na term that designates the specific outcome of the \u201cpeculiar\nselective preferences\u201d in favor of some, and against other,\nculture-traits of a given group. \u201cSuch facts\u201d Locke\nobserved\n\nnullify two of the most prevalent popular and scientific fallacies,\nthe ascription of a total culture to any one ethnic strain, and the\ninterpretation of culture in terms of the intrinsic rather than the\nfusion of its various constituent elements. (CRASC 195)\n\n\nTo illustrate Locke\u2019s view consider African Americans, they\nshare a common culture with white Americans in terms of language,\nreligion, aesthetic sense, and many other cultural elements. Even with\nthese cultural elements in common there are characteristic,\nqualitatively distinct, and phenomenologically unique forms that\ncommon language, religion, and aesthetic sense have among African\nAmericans that are not characteristic of white Americans.\nCharacteristic differences such as have produced the musical styles,\nliterary techniques, humor, oratorical idioms, mannerisms, forms of\nworship and religious expression, hair styles etc. and many other\nelements of culture that are the frequent objects of\nappropriation.\n\nA sense of kinship among members of a subcultural group which yields\nan understanding that \u201cdifferent practices [operate in] their\nsociety from those which [operate in other societies and therefore]\ndetermine their treatment of other groups,\u201d Locke argues is a\nkey element in racial differentiation. (Locke, 1992, 20) Racial\nconsciousness is not itself pernicious, but a group\u2019s sense of\nitself and its difference from other social races can be based on the\ndomination and oppression of other groups. (Locke, 1992, 20)\n\nA social group\u2019s sense of itself as a distinctive subculture\nyields the formation of peculiar values and beliefs, alongside\nspecific practices and forms of living. These produce over time\ndistinguishing qualities of the subculture in terms of elements that\nare noticeably present in one, or lacking from other groups. (Locke,\n1989, 194\u201396) Culture-traits\u2014ways of acting, speaking,\ninterrelating, worshipping, eating, expressing etc.\u2014establishes\na dominant and characteristic pattern in a population. This pattern\nconsists of social norms toward which members of the group conform.\nWith sufficient conformity around those norms a culture-type is\neventually established. (Locke, 1989, 194\u201395) Some people\nself-identify in racial terms, but the core elements with which they\nidentify may be illusory. Such identification can benefit a racialized\ngroup. Observing that some racial conceptions are ethnic fictions does\nnot lead Locke to deny the practical utility of racial\nidentification.\n",
