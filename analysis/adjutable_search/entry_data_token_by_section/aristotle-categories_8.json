    "main_text": "Whence the Categories?\n3. Whence the Categories?\n\nThe issue concerning the origin of the categories can be raised by\nasking the most difficult question there is about any philosophical\nposition: why think that it is correct? Why, in other words, should we\nthink that Aristotle\u2019s list of highest kinds contains all and\nonly the highest kinds there are?\n\nOne might, of course, reject the idea that there are some\nmetaphysically privileged kinds in the world. But here it is important\nto distinguish between internal and external questions concerning a\nsystem of categories. We can approach category theory externally in\nwhich case we would ask questions about the status of any system of\ncategories. So, for instance, we could ask whether any system of\ncategories must exhibit some kind of dependency on the mind, language,\nconceptual schemes, or whatever. Realists will answer this question in\nthe negative, and idealists of one stripe or another in the\naffirmative. In addition, we can ask about our epistemic access to the\nultimate categories in the world. And we can adopt positions ranging\nfrom a radical skepticism about our access to categories to a kind of\ninfallibilism about such access.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we approach category theory from an internal\nperspective, we will assume some answer to the external questions and\nthen go on to ask about the correctness of the system of categories\nunder those assumptions. So, for instance, we might adopt a realist\nperspective and hence assume that there is some correct metaphysically\nprivileged list of mind and language independent highest kinds as well\nas a correct account of the relations between them. And we can then\ntry to determine what that list is. Now, Aristotle certainly belongs\nto this latter tradition of speculation about categories: he assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures in the world. It is thus appropriate to assume\nrealism along with him and then inquire into the question of which\ncategories there might be.\n\nOne way of approaching this question is to ask whether there is some\nprincipled procedure by which Aristotle generated his list of\ncategories. For, if there is, then one could presumably assess his\nlist of highest kinds by assessing the procedure by which he generated\nit. Unfortunately, with the exception of some suggestive remarks in\nthe Topics, Aristotle does not indicate how he generated his\nscheme. Without some procedure by which one can generate his list,\nhowever, Aristotle\u2019s categories arguably lack any justification.\nThe issue is, of course, complicated by the fact that his list might\nbe justified without some procedure to generate it \u2014 perhaps we\ncan use a combination of metaphysical intuition and philosophical\nargumentation to convince ourselves that Aristotle\u2019s list is\ncomplete. Nonetheless, without some procedure of generation\nAristotle\u2019s categories at least appear in an uneasy light. And\nas a matter of historical fact, the lack of any justification for his\nlist of highest kinds has been the source of some famous criticisms.\nKant, for instance, just prior to the articulation of his own\ncategorial scheme, says:\n\nIt was an enterprise worthy of an acute thinker like Aristotle to make\nsearch for these fundamental concepts. But as he did so on no\nprinciple, he merely picked them up as they came his way, and at first\nprocured ten of them, which he called categories\n(predicaments). (Kant, Critique of Pure Reason,\nTranscendental Doctrine of Elements, Second Part, First Division, Book\nI, Chapter 1, Section 3, 10)\n\n\nAccording to Kant, Aristotle\u2019s list of categories was the result\nof an unsystematic, albeit a brilliant, bit of philosophical\nbrainstorming. Hence, it cannot stand firm as a correct set of\ncategories.\n\nAs it turns out, although Kant did not know of any procedure by which\nAristotle might have generated his list of categories, scholars have\ngiven a number of proposals. The proposals can be classified into four\ntypes, which I shall call: (1) The Question Approach; (2)\nThe Grammatical Approach; (3) The Modal Approach;\n(4) The Medieval Derivational Approach.\n\nJ.L. Ackrill (1963) is the most prominent defender of the Question\nApproach. He takes as evidence for his interpretation\nAristotle\u2019s remarks in Topics I 9. Ackrill claims that\nthere are two different ways to generate the categories, each of which\ninvolves asking questions. According to the first method, we are to\nask a single question \u2014 what is it? \u2014 of as many things as\nwe can. So, for instance, we can ask of Socrates, what is Socrates?\nAnd we can answer \u2014 Socrates is a human. We can then direct the\nsame question to the answer we have given: what is a human? And we can\nanswer: a human is an animal. Eventually, this process of question\nasking will lead us to some highest kind, in this case, Substance. If,\non the other hand, we had begun asking that same question of\nSocrates\u2019 color, say his whiteness, we would eventually have\nended at the highest kind quality. When carried out completely,\nAckrill claims, this procedure will yield the ten distinct and\nirreducible kinds that are Aristotle\u2019s categories. According to\nthe second method of questioning, we are to ask as many different\nquestions as we can about a single primary substance. So, for\ninstance, we might ask \u2014 how tall is Socrates? Where is\nSocrates? What is Socrates? And in answering these questions, we will\nrespond five feet, in the Agora, Human. We will then realize that our\nanswers to our various questions group into ten irreducible kinds.\n\nOf all the proposals that scholars have given, Ackrill\u2019s is the\nmost supported by Aristotle\u2019s texts, though the evidence he\ncites is far from conclusive. But from a philosophical point of view,\nthe question method suffers from some serious problems. First, it is\nfar from clear that either method actually produces Aristotle\u2019s\nlist. Suppose, for instance, I employ the second method and ask: does\nSocrates like Plato? The answer, let us grant, is \u2018yes\u2019.\nBut where does that answer belong in the categorical scheme? Ackrill\nmight respond by forcing the question to be one that is not answered\nwith \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. But we can still ask the\nquestion: is Socrates present-in or not present-in something else? The\nanswer, of course, is: not present-in; but where in Aristotle\u2019s\nlist of categories does not present-in belong? It is indeed hard to\nsee. Similar problems face the first method. Suppose I were to ask:\nwhat is Socrates\u2019 whiteness? I might respond by saying \u2018a\nparticular\u2019. Again, where does being a particular belong in\nAristotle\u2019s list of categories. Of course, particulars are part\nof the four-fold system of classification that Aristotle articulates.\nBut we are not at the moment concerned with that scheme. Indeed, to\nadvert to that scheme in the present context is simply to re-open the\nquestion of the relations between the two main systems of\nclassification in the Categories.\n\nEven if Ackrill can find some plausible route from questions to\nAristotle\u2019s categories, the methods he proposes still seem\nunsatisfactory for the simple reason that they depend far too much on\nour question-asking inclinations. It may be that the questions that we\nin fact ask will yield Aristotle\u2019s categories, but what we\nshould want to know is whether we are asking the right questions.\nUnless we can be confident that our questions are tracking the\nmetaphysical structures of the world, we should be unimpressed by the\nfact that they yield any set of categories. But to know whether our\nquestions are tracking the metaphysical structures of the world\nrequires us to have some way of establishing the correctness of the\ncategorial scheme. Clearly, at this point, we are in a circle that is\ntoo small to be of much help. Maybe all metaphysical theorizing is at\nsome level laden with circularity, but circles this small are\ngenerally unacceptable to a metaphysician.\n\nAccording to the grammatical approach, which traces to Trendelenburg\n(1846) and has most recently been defended by Michael Baumer (1993),\nAristotle generated his list by paying attention to the structures\ninherent in language. On the assumption that the metaphysical\nstructure of the world mirrors the structures in language, we should\nbe able to find the basic metaphysical structures by examining our\nlanguage. This approach is quite involved but for our purposes can be\nillustrated with a few examples. The distinction between substance and\nthe rest of the categories, for instance, is built into the\nsubject-predicate structure of our language. Consider, for instance,\nthe two sentences: (1) Socrates is a human; and (2) Socrates is white.\nFirst, we see that each sentence has a subject, namely\n\u2018Socrates\u2019. Corresponding to that subject, one might\nthink, is an entity of some kind, namely a primary substance.\nMoreover, the first sentence contains what might be called an\nindividuating predicate \u2014 it is a predicate of the form,\na such and such, rather than of the form, such and such. So,\none might think, there are predicates that attribute to primary\nsubstances properties the having of which suffices for that substance\nto be an individual of some kind. On the other hand, the second\nsentence contains a non-individuating predicate. So by examining the\ndetails of the predicates in our language, we have some grounds for\ndistinguishing between the category of substance and the accidental\ncategories.\n\nThe grammatical approach certainly does have some virtues. First, we\nhave ample evidence that Aristotle was sensitive to language and the\nstructures inherent in it. So it would not be all that surprising were\nhe led by his sensitivity to linguistic structures to his list of\ncategories. Moreover, some of the peculiarities of his list are nicely\nexplained in this way. Two of the highest kinds are action and\npassion. In Physics III 3, however, Aristotle argues that in\nthe world there is only motion and that the distinction between action\nand passion lies in the way in which one is considering the motion. So\nwhy should there be two distinct categories, namely action, and\npassion, rather than just one, namely motion? Well, the grammatical\napproach offers an explanation: in language, we differentiate between\nactive and passive verbs. Hence, there are two distinct categories,\nnot just one.\n\nDespite these virtues, the grammatical approach faces a difficult\nquestion: why think that the structures we find in language reflect\nthe metaphysical structures of the world? For instance, it may simply\nbe a historical accident that our language contains individuating and\nnon-individuating predicates. Likewise, it may be a historical\naccident that there are active and passive verbs in our language. Of\ncourse, this type of objection, when pushed to its limits, leads to\none of the more difficult philosophical questions, namely how can we\nbe sure that the structures of our representations are in any way\nrelated to what some might call the basic metaphysical structures and\nto what others might call the things in themselves? But one might hold\nout hope that some justification for a categorial scheme could be\ngiven that did not rest entirely on the unjustified assertion of some\ndeep correspondence between linguistic and metaphysical\nstructures.\n\nThe Modal Approach, which traces to Bonitz (1853) and has most\nrecently been defended by Julius Moravscik (1967), avoids the defects\nof both the previous two approaches. As Moravscik formulates this\nview, the categories are those types of entities to which any sensible\nparticular must be related. He says:\n\nAccording to this interpretation the constitutive principle of the\nlist of categories is that they constitute those classes of items to\neach of which any sensible particular \u2014 substantial or otherwise\n\u2014 must be related. Any sensible particular, substance, event,\nsound, etc. must be related to some substance; it must have some\nquality and quantity; it must have relational properties, it must be\nrelated to times and places; and it is placed within a network of\ncausal chains and laws, thus being related to the categories of\naffecting and being affected.\n\n\nIn virtue of its explicitly modal nature, the Modal Approach avoids\nthe defects of the previous two approaches. Whereas the first two\napproaches ultimately rely on some connection between metaphysical\nstructures and what appear to be merely contingent features of either\nour question asking proclivities or the structures inherent in our\nlanguage, the Modal Approach eliminates contingency altogether.\n\nDespite its explicitly modal character, the Modal Approach does face a\ndifficulty similar to the one faced by the Question Approach. It might\nturn out that employing the approach yields exactly the list of\nAristotle\u2019s categories, but then again it might not. So, for\ninstance, every material particular must be related to a particular.\nBut there is no category of particulars. There are, of course, beings\nthat are not said-of other beings. But not being said-of is not one of\nAristotle\u2019s categories. Moreover, must not every material\nparticular be related to matter? But matter is not a highest kind.\nIndeed, it is far from clear where matter belongs in the categories.\nSo, even if the Modal Approach is a good one for generating some list\nof kinds, it is not obvious that it is a good approach for generating\nAristotle\u2019s list of kinds. This problem could of course be\nalleviated somewhat if instead of merely appealing to modal structures\nas such, one could appeal to modal structures that arguably Aristotle\nwould have thought are part of the very fabric of the world. Then one\nwould at least have an explanation as to why Aristotle derived the\nlist he in fact derived, even if one is inclined to reject\nAristotle\u2019s list.\n\nThe last approach to the categories, namely the Medieval derivational\napproach, goes some way in the direction suggested but not taken by\nMoravscik\u2019s Modal Approach. There is a rich tradition of\ncommentators including Radulphus Brito, Albert the Great, Thomas\nAquinas, and most recently their modern heir Franz Brentano, who\nprovide precisely the kind of derivation for Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorial scheme found wanting by Kant. According to the commentators\nin this tradition, Aristotle\u2019s highest kinds are capable of a\nsystematic and arguably entirely a priori derivation. The\nfollowing quotation from Brentano captures nicely the philosophical\nimport of such derivations.\n\nOn the contrary, it seems to me that there is no doubt that Aristotle\ncould have arrived at a certain a priori proof, a deductive\nargument for the completeness of the distinction of categories\n\u2026 (On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle, Ch.5,\nsection 12)\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s enthusiasm about the possibility of deriving\nAristotle\u2019s categories is perhaps unjustified, but the idea that\nan a priori proof of the completeness of Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories is certainly an intriguing one.\n\nPerhaps the best representative of this type of interpretation occurs\nin Aquinas\u2019s commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. All of Aquinas\u2019s derivation deserves\nconsiderable attention, but for our purposes, it will suffice to quote\njust a portion of it so as to bring out its general character as well\nas one of its more interesting aspects.\n\nA predicate is referred to a subject in a second way when the\npredicate is taken as being in the subject, and this predicate is in\nthe subject either essentially and absolutely and as something flowing\nfrom its matter, and then it is quantity; or as something flowing from\nits form, and then it is quality; or it is not present in the subject\nabsolutely but with reference to something else, and then it is\nrelation. (Commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\nBook V, Lesson 9, Section 890)\n\n\nThis passage illustrates the tenor of the Medieval derivational\napproach. Aquinas articulates what appear to be principled\nmetaphysical principles concerning the way in which a predicate can\nbe, in his words, \u2018taken as being in a subject\u2019. There are\ntwo such ways: (1) essentially and absolutely; or (2) essentially and\nnot absolutely but with reference to something else. The latter way\ncorresponds to the category of relatives; the former, to the\ncategories of quality and quantity. Aquinas then divides the former\nway of being in a subject in terms of form and matter. He claims,\nstrikingly, that the category of quality flows from form and\nthat the category of quantity flows from matter.\n\nInspecting all of Aquinas\u2019s derivation to determine its cogency\nis far too large a project to undertake here. I have quoted the\nportion above to show the way in which the Medieval derivational\napproach augments in an interesting way Moravscik\u2019s Modal\nApproach. The Modal Approach, I argued, would gain some plausibility\nif there were some way of seeing Aristotle\u2019s own attitudes about\nthe modal structures in the material world somehow determining the\ngeneration of the categories. By invoking a combination of a\npriori sounding semantic principles and theses about the\nrelationship between form and quality and matter and quantity, Aquinas\nhas gone some way toward doing this. Aristotle is certainly committed\nto the claim that form and matter are two of the absolutely\nfundamental aspects of the material world. Indeed, he argues in the\nPhysics that form and matter are necessary for the existence\nof motion, which, he thinks, essentially characterizes bodies.\n\nIf the Medieval Derivational Approach is correct, Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories ultimately trace to the ways in which form, matter, and\nperhaps motion relate to substances and the predicates that apply to\nthem. Whether the derivations can withstand philosophical scrutiny is\nof course an important question, one that I will not pursue here,\nthough I will say that Brentano was probably a bit too enthusiastic\nabout the prospects for an entirely satisfactory a priori\nproof of the completeness of Aristotle\u2019s categories. Moreover,\nthe Medieval interpretations face the charge that they are an\nover-interpretation of Aristotle. Aristotle simply does not provide in\nhis surviving writings the sort of conceptual connections that\nunderlie the Medieval derivations. So perhaps the Medievals have\nsuccumbed to the temptation to read into Aristotle\u2019s system\nconnections that Aristotle did not accept. Indeed, from a\ntwentieth-century perspective, the Medieval derivations look very\nstrange. It is commonplace in contemporary Aristotle scholarship to\nview the Categories as an early work and to think that\nAristotle had not developed his theory of form and matter until later\nin his career. If this general approach is correct, the claim that the\ncategorial scheme can somehow be derived at least in part from form\nand matter appears implausible.\n\nAs should be clear from this brief discussion, providing a complete\nderivation of Aristotle\u2019s categorical scheme would be a\ndifficult, indeed perhaps impossible, task. After all, someone might\nconclude that Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme was either in part\nor in whole mistaken. Minimally, the task is a daunting one. But of\ncourse, the difficulty in establishing its ultimate correctness is not\npeculiar to Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme. Indeed, it should not\nbe at all surprising that the difficulties that have beset\nmetaphysical speculation in the Western tradition can be seen in such\na stark and provocative fashion in one of the great founding works of\nthat very tradition. In fact, it is in part due to such difficulties\nthat external questions about categorial and other metaphysical\nstructures arise. Such difficulties understandably lead to questions\nabout the legitimacy of category theory and metaphysical speculation\nin general. Unfortunately, the history of metaphysical speculation has\nshown that it is no less difficult to establish answers to external\nthan to internal questions about category theory. That acknowledged it\nis noteworthy that questions of both sorts owe their first\nformulations, ultimately, to the categorialism of Aristotle\u2019s\nseminal work, the Categories.\n",
