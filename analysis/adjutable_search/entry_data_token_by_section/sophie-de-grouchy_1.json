    "main_text": "Enlightenment and Revolution\n2. Enlightenment and Revolution\n\nGrouchy was very much a product of the Enlightenment ideas that\ninfluenced the French Revolution. As a teenager, she gave up religion\nand embraced Voltaire, Rousseau, and social justice. Her salon was the\nheart of the revolutionary faction that had the most contact with\nforeigners such as Thomas Paine. She was also, through Brissot,\nclosely connected to the Girondins, and through him and her husband,\nCondorcet, to the French abolitionist movement. Although she did not\nherself write about women\u2019s rights, it is not unlikely that she\nhad some influence over her husband\u2019s short piece on this\nsubject written in 1790: \u201cOn the Right of Women to the\nCity\u201d.\n",
