    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Sustaining the Economy\n1.2 Sustaining the Economy\n\n\nAnother popular argument against open borders is that the influx of\nnewcomers will hurt the economy. In its most straightforward\nversion, this argument simply assumes that the domestic economy can\nsupport only a certain number of workers, but more nuanced renditions\nallege more specifically that at least some types of foreigners should\nbe excluded because, given the cultural differences between insiders\nand these particular outsiders, the inclusion of the latter would not\nbe conducive to economic growth (perhaps because these outsiders lack\nthe requisite work ethic, for instance).\n\n\nThe most common response to this argument is simply to contest that\nallowing immigrants will have negative economic consequences. It\nseems clear that some in the domestic economy may be harmed (typically\nthe less skilled workers disproportionately bear the brunt of the\ncosts, since they must now compete with immigrants whose presence\ndrives down wages), but the economy as a whole often benefits as (1)\nfirms are able to hire cheaper labor (and pass along correspondingly\nlower prices to consumers), and (2) there is an increased demand for\nvarious goods and services. More generally, even if a given\ndomestic economy might suffer if it did not restrict immigration,\neconomists tend to agree that the global economy as a whole would\nprofit from fewer restrictions on who can work where. (From an\npurely economic perspective, the inefficiencies of barring Africans\nfrom competing for work in European countries are costly, just as those\nwhich resulted from prohibiting women from working in a\n\u2018man\u2019s\u2019 job were.) This recognition that there\nwill inevitably be net winners and losers whenever a market restriction\nis lifted points toward the important moral question as to whether\nanyone has a moral right to the economic benefits of the status\nquo. For example, let us suppose that less skilled American\nlaborers would be harmed, whereas American firms and consumers along\nwith Mexican immigrants would benefit if the current restriction on\nMexican immigration were lifted. If so, then immigration would be\nimpermissible in this case only if the potentially displaced American\nworkers have a right not to face the increased competition for their\njobs (Macedo 2007).\n\n\nWe cannot presume that these domestic workers necessarily lack such\na right, but neither should we assume that they have it. What is\nmore, even if these workers have a right not to be harmed, it does not\nfollow that opening the economy to foreign workers must be\nimpermissible, at least if there were some way the workers could be\nadequately compensated for the costs that they disproportionately\nbear. (Think, for instance, of how the US government routinely\nprovides special unemployment and educational benefits to displaced\nworkers, like those in the textile industry, who lose their jobs as a\nconsequence of new legislation liberalizing trade with foreign\ncountries.) To be successful, then, the economic argument must be\nmuch more sophisticated than it might initially appear; in addition to\nestablishing that at least some people will incur economic losses,\nproponents of this approach must demonstrate that these victims have a\nmoral right to be spared these costs, a right for which they cannot be\nadequately compensated in other ways.\n",
