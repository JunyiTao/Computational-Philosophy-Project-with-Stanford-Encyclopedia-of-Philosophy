    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || Soul and body\n4.6 Soul and body\n\nIn a huge catalogue of philosophical opinions, which is of\nconsiderable interest, Philo begins by demonstrating how little we\nknow about heaven, then arrives at the human being about whom he says\nthat he/she has four parts: body, sensibility, speech, intellect\n(nous) (Somn. 1.25). He exposes all that we know\nabout the first three, for example, that body has three dimensions and\nsix ways of moving. But about the intellect, he says that it is\nabsolutely unintelligible. Nothing is known about its nature, its way\nof arriving in the body, or its place. As with the place of heaven in\nthe world, we are unable to say anything about it. But in contrast\nwith this scientific and philosophical ignorance, the Bible gives its\nreader true information. The intellect is a divine emanation\n(Somn. 1.34, Genesis 2:7), and the human being is the one who\nreceived the privilege of worshipping God, the One Being. There are\ngrounding elements of the problem: what must the human being do in the\nface of such problems? Philo\u2019s answer is both philosophical and\ntheological. She must, like Socrates or like Terah (father of Abraham)\nin the Torah, make a constant effort to have better self-knowledge.\nSocrates is the man who had no other philosophy than to know himself,\nwhile Terah is the very idea of knowing oneself. What does it mean to\nknow oneself? Essentially, to have a clearer idea of one\u2019s\nposition with respect to God and His powers in order to have the means\nof becoming wiser, and therefore better. The human being has no other\npersonal good than reason. The paradoxical aim of reason is to\nperceive the distance between God and His creation (Somn.\n1.66) and so to understand how far He is from human comprehension.\n\nTo know oneself does not mean to have a perfect science of what a soul\nis. Philo knows all the suppositions elaborated by philosophers and he\nuses many of them, but without ever saying that he is in possession of\nknowledge of the soul. It has been rightly said that his purpose was\nnot to build a scientific but a \u201creligious psychology\u201d. In\nthis kind of psychology, it was not essential to know if a soul has\nseven components besides reason, as it is said by the Stoics, or\nthree, like in the Platonic division, or if it contains, besides\nreason, nutritive and sensitive parts like in Aristotelianism. Here\nI\u2019ll give a few examples of his varieties of uses. In\nOpif. 117, soul is compared to a puppet show, the seven\npuppets being manipulated by the h\u00e8gemonikon, the\ncentral rational element. This metaphor strongly reminds us of the\nStoic comparison with the octopus, but is also very different from\nthis image. The octopus is a living unity, while the puppet master is\nessentially different from his puppets. The Stoic metaphor of the\noctopus is a monist one, but the Philonian image, inspired from Plato\n(Laws 644d), is strongly dualistic. The puppets are not even\nirrational beings as they are mere objects. But it is true that in\nLeg. 1.28, the image of the source and the stream could have\nbeen used by the most orthodox of the Stoics if separated from its\ncontext. In 1.29, Philo says that the intellect (nous, note\nthat he does not use the Stoic word logos) is like a source\ngoing to the senses. There is, however, no contradiction in all this.\nIn 1.30, Philo uses a strictly Stoic definition: the living being is\ncharacterized by representation and impulse. But when he arrives to\nthe human being at 1.31, Stoicism is completed by a Biblical quotation\n(Genesis 2:7). A Stoic image is a good way to speak about living\nbeings, but it is not enough when the narrative is about humans. That\nis why Philo often uses the distinction between rational and\nirrational beings with an opposition between the\nh\u00e8gemonikon, unique and rational, and the other parts\nof soul, divided in seven and irrational. However, it must be added\nthat in Philo, dualistic images do not imply the division of the soul.\nIn Leg. 2.8, he asserts that sensation and passions are like\nparts and products of a unified soul. Such are the multi-layered\nlevels of language Philo is capable of using at every page. For him,\nit is impossible to know what a human soul is, but it is not necessary\nto have this kind of knowledge in order to try to understand what the\nmeaning of the word of the Lord is. To be conscious of her ignorance\nin the field of psychology, far from being an obstacle, actually helps\nto have a better perception of the limitations inherent to human\nnature. But this consciousness itself necessarily rises from the\nconfrontation of the philosophical doctrines.\n\nIt would be an error to affirm that Philo despises and hates the body.\nEven if he is often very harsh towards it, he never forgets that when\nGod created the first human being, He made him not only spiritually\nperfect, but also physically beautiful. He does not see any\ninconvenience in emphasizing the perfection of sensation or sexuality.\nIt is said in Opif. 136 that the first human being was truly\nand really kalos kagathos, beautiful and good. It is strange\nto find in a Jewish biblical commentator the explicit expression of\nthis Greek ideal of humanity. At the same time, it could mean that for\nPhilo the Greek conception of this expression was an erroneous one,\nsince it did not imply an immediate link with divine transcendence.\nGod, Philo says, was a good technit\u00e8s, both of the\nbody and the soul. The beauty of the body is in Opif. 138\nexplained in specific Greek terms, symmetry, beauty of the flesh, and\ncolor. All these concepts can be found in Plato, Aristotle, and the\nStoics, but it does not mean that Philo uses them in the same way. In\nPhilo, the body is not a principle of evil, though it can be used as\nan instrument of perversion when the human being focuses more on\nhimself than on the powers of God. We find in Leg. 3.71,\nhowever, the assertion that the body is bad by nature,\npon\u00e8ron fusei. The meaning of the expression is\nperfectly clear, but it is also necessary to remember the context.\nPhilo is commenting on Genesis 38:7, where it is said that God killed\nEr without any justified reason. According to Philo, \u201cER\u201d\nmeans in Hebrew the flesh, the body which is a threat for the soul.\nBut at the same time Philo specifies that to create the best things,\nGod had to create less good things. This can lead to the conclusion\nthat the pon\u00e8ron fusei means not absolute but relative\nperversion since the body is necessary to demonstrate, by contrast,\nthe beauty of soul. Creation is good by nature (fusei) and\nthe body is an element of the Creation. The example of Issachar in\nLeg. 1.83 shows how necessary the body is for ethical\nprogress. But at the same time, the knowledge of the body can be only\nphenomenological, while real research is ontological. This can explain\nPhilo\u2019s violent attacks on the body: it is a tomb (following the\nPlatonic play on words comparing the body to a tomb), a\nnos\u00e8ma (disease), a vase unable to contain its desire,\nand most frequently a burden of flesh. But all this verbal violence is\naddressed more to human error on the value of the body than to the\nbody itself created by God.\n",
