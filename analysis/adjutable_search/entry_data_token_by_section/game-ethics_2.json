    "main_text": "Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality\n3. Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality\n\nKavka (1984) dubs the body of attempts to establish that compliance\nwith moral requirements is demanded by, or at least compatible with,\nprudential rationality the Reconciliation Project. At least\nsince Plato philosophers have been grappling with this project, and\ngame theory can help us to distinguish between three approaches they\nhave taken.\n\nThe challenge presented by Hobbes\u2019 Foole in Leviathan\n(Hobbes 1651: chapter 15) nicely characterizes the core issue at stake\nin the Reconciliation Project. The Foole maintains that under certain\ncircumstances one\u2019s \u201cmost reasonable\u201d course of\naction is to commit an injustice. Specifically, the Foole claims one\nshould sometimes break a promise she has made as part of a covenant if\nthe other parties to the covenant have already kept (or will be\ncompelled to keep) their promises (Hobbes 1651: 15:5). This is because\nperforming as a covenant requires can be costly and rationality\nplausibly requires that such costs should be avoided if one\ndoesn\u2019t stand to gain anything further by incurring them. This\nchallenge is illustrated in the decision tree in\n Figure 2\n below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Foole\u2019s Opportunity Game\n[An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere Claudia and Laura have created a bilateral covenant by exchanging\npromises. But because Claudia has already performed her part of the\ncovenant, and Laura knows this, Laura stands in the position of the\nFoole and can either perform (P) as the covenant\nrequires of her or aggress (A) by breaking her\npromise and exploiting Claudia\u2019s earlier performance. As the\nFoole contends, given this payoff structure, A is\nLaura\u2019s unique Bayesian rational choice.\n\nImportantly, though, the Foole does not just present a challenge to\nthose who endorse her reasoning. This is because in order to avoid\nbeing taken advantage of by individuals who reason like the Foole,\nindividuals who might otherwise be inclined to keep their promises can\nsometimes find themselves with reason to break their promises. We see\nthis in\n Figure 3\n below which depicts the sequential prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nthat results from extending the decision tree from\n Figure 2\n to include Claudia\u2019s initial move.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Sequential Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn this extensive form game, which makes explicit the\nsequential order of the agents\u2019 actions, the\nith component of each payoff vector is the payoff\nof the ith agent who moves in the game (so\nClaudia\u2019s payoff is depicted first, since she acts first). Here\nwe can suppose that Claudia does not agree with the Foole that one\nshould break her promise if one\u2019s partner in a covenant has kept\nher promise, but a dilemma nevertheless arises if Claudia suspects\nthat Laura might agree with the Foole. This is because Claudia might\nreason that if she performs, then Laura, having already benefited and\nnot standing to gain anything further, will not reciprocate.\nConsequently, Claudia, anticipating (A)\nLaura\u2019s aggression, decides not to perform, leading Laura, now\nunderstandably, not to perform either, so that each ultimately does\nworse than if they had both performed.\n\nTo take up the Reconciliation Project is to argue alongside Hobbes\nthat the Foole is not right, and that we need not worry that for some\namong us rationality might counsel against acting as morality\nrequires. And, as we indicated above, there are three main strategies\nfor doing so.\n",
