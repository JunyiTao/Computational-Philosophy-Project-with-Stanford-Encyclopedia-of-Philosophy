    "main_text": "Possibility and Human Freedom\n7. The System and its Pillars\n\nIt is presumably an adequacy condition on the interpretation of the\nwork of any systematic philosopher that the work be interpreted in\nlight of the central tenets of that philosopher\u2019s system. The\ninterpretive problem of course is that for almost any such philosopher\nthere are controversies about what these central tenets are. It is\nuncontroversial that Descartes sometimes speaks of possibility and\nnecessity. What is not so uncontroversial is what he is talking about\nwhen he talks about these. In particular, if Descartes is committed to\nthe view that there is unactualized possible being, then either (1)\nthe alleged parts of his system that seem to disallow such being are\nnot parts of his system, (2) the parts of his system that seem to\ndisallow such being do not really disallow it, or (3) he is not a\nwholly systematic philosopher. There is no chance that (3) is right,\nbut much work remains to be done in debates over (1) and (2).\n",
