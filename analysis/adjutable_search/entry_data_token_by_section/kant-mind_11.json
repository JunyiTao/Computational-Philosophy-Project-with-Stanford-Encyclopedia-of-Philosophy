    "main_text": "Consciousness of Self and Knowledge of Self || Thesis 1: Two Kinds of Consciousness of Self\n4.1 Thesis 1: Two Kinds of Consciousness of Self\n\n\nThe first thesis:\n\nThere are two kinds of consciousness of self: consciousness of\noneself and one\u2019s psychological states in inner sense and\nconsciousness of oneself and one\u2019s states via performing acts of\napperception. \n\n\nKant\u2019s term for the former was \u2018empirical\nself-consciousness\u2019. A leading term for the latter was\n\u2018transcendental apperception\u2019 (TA). (Kant used the term\n\u2018TA\u2019 in two very different ways, as the name for a faculty\nof synthesis and as the name for what he also referred to as the\n\u2018I think\u2019, namely, one\u2019s consciousness of oneself as\nsubject.) Here is a passage from the Anthropology in which\nKant distinguishes the two kinds of consciousness of self very\nclearly:\n\u2026 the \u201cI\u201d of reflection\ncontains no manifold and is always the same in every judgment \u2026\nInner experience, on the other hand, contains the matter of\nconsciousness and a manifold of empirical inner intuition: \u2026\n[1798, Ak. VII:141\u20132, emphases in the original].\n\n\nThe two kinds of consciousness of self have very different\nsources.\n\n\nThe source of empirical self-consciousness is what Kant called inner\nsense. He did not work out his notion of inner sense at all well. Here\nare just a few of the problems. Kant insists that all representational\nstates are in inner sense, including those representing the objects of\nouter sense (i.e., spatially located objects):\nWhatever the origins of our representations, whether they\nare due to the influence of outer things, or are produced through inner\ncauses, whether they arise a priori, or being appearances have\nan empirical origin, they must all, as modifications of the mind,\nbelong to inner sense. [A98\u20139]\n\n\nHowever, he also says that the object of inner sense is the soul,\nthe object of outer sense the body (including one\u2019s own). He comes\nclose to denying that we can be conscious of the denizens of inner\nsense\u2014they do not represent inner objects and have no manifold\nof their own. Yet he also says that we can be conscious of them \u2014\nrepresentations can themselves be objects of representations, indeed,\nrepresentations can make us conscious of themselves. In its role as a\nform of or means to consciousness of self, apperception ought to be\npart of inner sense. Yet Kant regularly contrasted apperception, a\nmeans to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s acts of thinking, with\ninner sense as a means to consciousness of\u2014what? Presumably,\nparticular representations: perceptions, imaginings, memories, etc.\nHere is another passage from the Anthropology:\n\u00a724. Inner sense is not pure apperception,\nconsciousness of what we are doing; for this belongs to the power of\nthinking. It is, rather, consciousness of what we undergo as we are\naffected by the play of our own thoughts. This consciousness rests on\ninner intuition, and so on the relation of ideas (as they are either\nsimultaneous or successive). [1798, Ak. VII:161]\n\n\nKant makes the same distinction in CPR:\n\u2026 the I that I think is distinct from the I that it,\nitself, intuits \u2026; I am given to myself beyond that which is\ngiven in intuition, and yet know myself, like other phenomena, only as\nI appear to myself, not as I am \u2026 [B155].\n\n\nSince most of Kant\u2019s most interesting remarks about consciousness of\nand knowledge of self concern consciousness of oneself, the \u2018I of\nreflection\u2019 via acts of apperception, we will focus on it, though empirical consciousness\nof self will appear again briefly from time to time.\n4.2 Thesis 2: Representational Base of Consciousness of Oneself and One\u2019s States\n\n\nHow does apperception give rise to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates? In the passage just quoted from the Anthropology,\nnotice the phrase \u201cconsciousness of what we are doing\u201d\n\u2014 doing. The way in which one becomes conscious of an\nact of representing is not by receiving intuitions but by\ndoing it: \u201csynthesis \u2026, as an act, \u2026 is conscious\nto itself, even without sensibility\u201d (B153); \u201c\u2026\nthis representation is an act of spontaneity, that is, it\ncannot be regarded as belonging to sensibility\u201d (B132).\n\n\nEqually, we can be conscious of ourselves as subject merely by doing\nacts of representing. No further representation is needed.\nMan, \u2026 who knows the rest of nature solely through\nthe senses, knows himself also through pure apperception; and this,\nindeed, in acts and inner determinations which he cannot regard as\nimpressions of the senses [A546=B574].\n\n\nHow does one\u2019s consciousness of oneself in one\u2019s acts of\nrepresenting work? Consider the sentence:\nI am looking at the words on the screen in front of\nme.\n\n\nKant\u2019s claim seems to be that the representation of the words on the\nscreen is all the experience I need to be conscious not just of the\nwords and the screen but also of the act of seeing them and of\nwho is seeing them, namely, me. A single representation can do\nall three jobs. Let us call an act of representing that can make one\nconscious of its object, itself and oneself as its subject the\nrepresentational base of consciousness of these three\n items.[7]\n Kant\u2019s second major thesis is,\n\nMost ordinary representations generated by most ordinary acts of\nsynthesis provide the representational base of consciousness of\noneself and one\u2019s states.\n\n\n\nNote that this representational base is the base not only of\nconsciousness of one\u2019s representational states. It is also the base of\nconsciousness of oneself as the subject of those states\u2014as the\nthing that has and does them. Though it is hard to know for sure,\nKant would probably have denied that consciousness of oneself in inner\nsense can make one conscious of oneself as subject, of oneself as\noneself, in this way. \n\n\nFor Kant, this distinction between consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates by doing acts of synthesis and consciousness of oneself and\none\u2019s states as the objects of particular representations is of\nfundamental importance. When one is conscious of oneself and one\u2019s\nstates by doing cognitive and perceptual acts, one is conscious of\noneself as spontaneous, rational, self-legislating, free\u2014as\nthe doer of deeds, not just as a passive receptacle for\nrepresentations: \u201cI exist as an intelligence which is conscious\nsolely of its power of combination\u201d (B158\u2013159), of \u201cthe\nactivity of the self\u201d (B68) (Sellars, 1970\u20131; Pippin, 1987).\n\n\nSo far we have focussed on individual representations. For Kant,\nhowever, the representations that serve as the representational base of\nconsciousness of oneself as subject are usually much\n\u2018bigger\u2019 than that, i.e., contain multiple objects and\noften multiple representations of them tied together into what Kant\ncalled \u2018general experience\u2019.\nWhen we speak of different experiences, we can refer only\nto the various perceptions, all of which belong to one and the same\ngeneral experience. This thoroughgoing synthetic unity of perceptions\nis the form of experience; it is nothing less than the synthetic unity\nof appearances in accordance with concepts [A110].\n\n\nThis general experience is the global representation introduced\nearlier. When I am conscious of many objects and/or representations of\nthem as the single object of a single global representation, the latter\nrepresentation is all the representation I need to be conscious not\njust of the global object but also of myself as the common subject of\nall the constituent representations.\nThe mind could never think its identity in the manifoldness\nof its representations\u2026 if it did not have before its eyes the\nidentity of its act, whereby it subordinates all [the manifold]\n\u2026 to a transcendental unity\u2026 [A108].\n\n\nI am conscious of myself as the single common subject of a certain\ngroup of experiences by being conscious of \u201cthe identity of the\nconsciousness in \u2026 conjoined \u2026 representations\u201d\n(B133).\n4.3 Thesis 3: Consciousness in Inner Sense is Only of How One Appears to Oneself\n\n\nNeither consciousness of self by doing apperceptive acts nor empirical\nconsciousness of self as the object of particular representations\nyields knowledge of oneself as one is. On pain of putting his right to\nbelieve in immortality as an article of faith at risk, Kant absolutely\nhad to claim this. As he put it,\nit would be a great stumbling block, or rather would be the\none unanswerable objection, to our whole critique if it were possible\nto prove a priori that all thinking beings are in themselves\nsimple substances. [B409]\n\n\nThe same would hold for all other properties of thinking beings.\nSince Kant also sometimes viewed immortality, i.e., personal\ncontinuity beyond death, as a foundation of morality, morality could\nalso be at risk. So Kant had powerful motives to maintain that one\ndoes not know oneself as one is. Yet, according to him, we seem to\nknow at least some things about ourselves, namely, how we must\nfunction, and it would be implausible to maintain that one never\nconscious of one\u2019s real self at all. Kant\u2019s response to these pressures\nis ingenious.\n\n\nFirst, he treats inner sense: When we know ourselves as the object of\na representation in inner sense, we \u201cknow even ourselves only\n.. as appearance \u2026\u201d (A278).\nInner \u2026 sense \u2026 represents to consciousness even our\nown selves only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in ourselves.\nFor we intuit ourselves only as we are inwardly affected [by\nourselves] (B153).\n\n\nThis is the third thesis:\n\nIn inner sense, one is conscious of oneself only as one appears to\noneself, not as one is.\n\n\n\nSo when we seem to be directly conscious of features of ourselves,\nwe in fact have the same kind of consciousness of them as we have of features\nof things in general\u2014we appear to ourselves to be like this,\nthat or the other, in just the way that we know of any object only as\nit appears to us.\n\n\nThen he turns to consciousness of oneself and one\u2019s states by doing\napperceptive acts. This is a knottier problem. Here we will consider\nonly consciousness of oneself as subject. Certainly by the second\nedition, Kant had come to see how implausible it would be to maintain\nthat one has no consciousness of oneself, one\u2019s real self, at all when\none is conscious of oneself as the subject of one\u2019s experience, agent\nof one\u2019s acts, by having these experiences and doing those acts. In\nthe 2nd edition, he reflects this sensitivity as early as\nB68; at B153, he goes so far as to say that an apparent contradiction\nis involved. \n\n\nFurthermore, when we are conscious of ourselves as subject and agent\nby doing acts of apperceiving, we do appear to ourselves to\nbe substantial, simple and continuing. He had to explain these\nappearances away; doing so was one of his aims, indeed, in his attacks on\nthe second and third Paralogisms. Thus, Kant had strong motives to\ngive consciousness of self as subject special treatment. The view that proposes is puzzling. I am not consciousness of myself as I appear to myself, nor as I am in myself but only \u201cthat I am\u201d (B157). To understand what he might mean here, we need a couple of intermediate theses. They contain the remarkable insights into reference to and consciousness of self mentioned earlier.\n4.4 Thesis 4: Referential Machinery of Consciousness of Self\n\n\nKant generated the special treatment he needed by focussing first on\nreference to self. Here are some of the things that he said about\nreference to oneself as subject. It is a consciousness of self in\nwhich \u201cnothing manifold is given.\u201d (B135). In the kind of\nreference in which we gain this consciousness of self, we\n\u201cdenote\u201d but do not \u201crepresent\u201d ourselves\n(A382). We designate ourselves without noting \u201cany quality\nwhatsoever\u201d in ourselves (A355). This yields his fourth thesis\nabout consciousness of and knowledge of self.\n\nThe referential machinery used to obtain consciousness of self as\nsubject requires no identifying (or other) ascription of properties to\noneself.\n\n\n\nThis is a remarkably penetrating claim; remember, the study of\nreference and semantics generally is usually thought to have begun only\nwith Frege. Kant is anticipating two important theses about reference\nto self that next saw the light of day only 200 years later.\n\nIn certain kinds of consciousness of self, one can be conscious of\nsomething as oneself without identifying it (or anything) as oneself\nvia properties that one has ascribed to the thing (self-reference\nwithout identification) (Shoemaker\n 1968),[8]\n\n\nand,\n\n\nIn such cases, first-person\n indexicals\n (I, me, my, mine) cannot be analysed out in favour of anything else,\nin particular anything descriptionlike (the essential indexical)\n(Perry 1979). \n\n\nWas Kant actually aware of (1) and/or (2) or had he just stumbled\nacross something that later philosophers recognized as significant?\n\n\nOne standard argument for (1) goes as follows:\nMy use of the word \u2018I\u2019 as the subject of\n[statements such as \u2018I feel pain\u2019 or \u2018I see a\ncanary\u2019] is not due to my having identified as myself something\n[otherwise recognized] of which I know, or believe, or wish to say,\nthat the predicate of my statement applies to it [Shoemaker 1968,\npp.558].\n\n\nA standard argument for (2), that certain indexicals are essential,\ngoes as follows. To know that I wrote a certain book a few\nyears ago, it is not enough to know that someone over six feet tall\nwrote that book, or that someone who teaches philosophy at a particular\nuniversity wrote that book, or \u2026 or \u2026 or \u2026 , for I\ncould know all these things without knowing that it was me who\nhas these properties (and I could know that it was me who\nwrote that book and not know that any of these things are properties of\nme). As Shoemaker puts it,\n\u2026 no matter how detailed a token-reflexive-free\ndescription of a person is, \u2026 it cannot possibly entail that I\nam that person [1968, pp. 560].\n\n\nKant unquestionably articulated the argument for (1):\nIn attaching \u2018I\u2019 to our thoughts, we designate\nthe subject only transcendentally \u2026 without noting in it any\nquality whatsoever\u2014in fact, without knowing anything of it\neither directly or by inference [A355].\n\n\nThis transcendental designation, i.e., referring to oneself\nusing \u2018I\u2019 without \u2018noting any quality\u2019 in\noneself, has some unusual features. One can refer to oneself in a\nvariety of ways, of course: as the person in the mirror, as the person\nborn on such and such a date in such and such a place, as the first\nperson to do X, and so on, but one way of referring to oneself\nis special: it does not require identifying or indeed any ascription to\noneself. So Kant tells\n us.[9]\n\n\nThe question is more complicated with respect to (2). We cannot go\ninto the complexities here (see Brook 2001). Here we will just note\nthree passages in which Kant may be referring to the essential\nindexical or something like it.\nThe subject of the categories cannot by thinking the\ncategories [i.e. applying them to objects] acquire a concept of itself\nas an object of the categories. For in order to think them, its pure\nself-consciousness, which is what was to be explained, must itself be\npresupposed. [B422]\n\n\nThe phrase \u2018its pure self-consciousness\u2019 seems to refer\nto consciousness of oneself as subject. If so, the passage may be\nsaying that judgments about oneself, i.e., ascriptions of properties to\noneself, \u2018presuppose \u2026 pure self-consciousness\u2019,\ni.e., consciousness of oneself via an act of ascription-free\ntranscendental designation.\n\n\nNow compare this, \u201cit is \u2026 very evident that I cannot\nknow as an object that which I must presuppose to know any object\n\u2026 .\u201d (A402), and this,\nThrough this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks,\nnothing further is represented than a transcendental subject of the\nthoughts = X. It is known only through the thoughts which are\nits predicates, and of it, apart from them, we cannot have any concept\nwhatsoever, but can only revolve in a perpetual circle, since any\njudgment upon it has always already made use of its representation.\n[A346=B404]\n\n\nThe last clause is the key one: \u201cany judgment upon it has\nalways already made use of its representation\u201d. Kant seems to be\nsaying that to know that anything is true of me, I must first know that\nit is me of whom it is true. This is something very like the essential\nindexical claim.\n\n\nIf reference to self takes place without \u2018noting any\nproperties\u2019 of oneself, the consciousness that results will also\nhave some special features.\n4.5 Thesis 5: No Manifold in Consciousness of Self\n\n\nThe most important special feature is that, in this kind of\nconsciousness of self, one is not, or need not be, conscious of any\nproperties of oneself, certainly not any particular properties. One has\nthe same consciousness of self no matter what else one is conscious of\n\u2014 thinking, perceiving, laughing, being miserable, or whatever.\nKant expressed the thought this way,\nthrough the \u2018I\u2019, as simple representation,\nnothing manifold is given. [B135]\n\n\nAnd this,\nthe I that I think is distinct from the I that it \u2026\nintuits \u2026; I am given to myself beyond that which is given in\nintuition. [B155]\n\n\nWe now have the fifth thesis to be found in Kant:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one has a bare\nconsciousness of self in which \u201cnothing manifold is\ngiven.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince, on Kant\u2019s view, one can refer to oneself as oneself without knowing any properties of oneself, not just identifying properties, \u2018non-ascriptive reference to self\u2019 might capture what is special about this form of consciousness of self better than Shoemaker\u2019s \u2018self-reference\nwithout identification\u2019.\n4.6 Thesis 6: Consciousness of Self is not Knowledge of Self\n\n\nTranscendental designation immediately yields the distinction that\nKant needs to allow that one is conscious of oneself as one is, not\njust of an appearance of self, and yet deny knowledge of oneself as one\nis. If consciousness of self ascribes nothing to the self, it can be a\n\u201cbare \u2026 consciousness of self [as one is]\u201d and yet\nyield no knowledge of self\u2014it is \u201cvery far from being a\nknowledge of the self\u201d (B158). This thesis returns us to\nconsciousness of self as subject:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one\u2019s bare\nconsciousness of self yields no knowledge of self.\n\n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s own work, he then put the idea of transcendental\ndesignation to work to explain how one can appear to oneself to be\nsubstantial, simple and persisting without these appearances reflecting\nhow one actually is. The reason that one appears in these ways is not\nthat the self is some strange, indefinable being. It is because of the\nkind of referring that we do to become conscious of oneself as subject.\nGiven how long ago he worked, Kant\u2019s insights into this kind of\nreferring are nothing short of amazing.\n4.7 Thesis 7: Conscious of Self as Single, Common Subject of Experience\n\n\nThe last of Kant\u2019s seven theses about consciousness of self is an\nidea that we already met when we discussed the unity of\nconsciousness:\n\nWhen we are conscious of ourselves as subject, we are conscious of\nourselves as the \u201csingle common subject\u201d [CPR,\nA350] of a number of representations.\n\n\n\nWhat Kant likely had in mind is nicely captured in a remark of\nBennett\u2019s (1974, p. 83): to think of myself as a plurality of things is\nto think of my being conscious of this plurality, \u201cand\nthat pre-requires an undivided me.\u201d Unlike one of anything else, it is not optional that I think of myself as one subject across a\nvariety of experiences (A107).\n5. Knowledge of the Mind\n\n\nThe remarks just noted about \u2018bare consciousness\u2019 and so\non by no means exhaust the concerns that can be raised about Kant and\nwhat we can know about the mind. His official view has to be: nothing\n\u2014 about the mind\u2019s structure and what it is composed of, at any\nrate, we can know nothing. As we have seen, Kant not only maintained\nthis but did some ingenious wiggling to account for the apparent\ncounter-evidence. But that is not the end of the story, for two\nreasons.\n\n\nFirst, whatever the commitments of his philosophy, Kant the person\nbelieved that the soul is simple and persists beyond death; he found\nmaterialism utterly repugnant (1783, Ak. IV, end of \u00a746). This is\nan interesting psychological fact about Kant but needs no further\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSecond and more importantly, Kant in fact held that we do\nhave knowledge of the mind as it is. In particular, we know that it has\nforms of intuition in which it must locate things spatially and\ntemporally, that it must synthesize the raw manifold of intuition in\nthree ways, that its consciousness must be unified, and so on \u2014\nall the aspects of the model examined above.\n\n\nTo square his beliefs about what we cannot know and what we do know\nabout the mind, Kant could have made at least two moves. He could have\nsaid that we know these things only \u2018transcendentally\u2019,\nthat is to say, by inference to the necessary conditions of experience.\nWe do not know them directly, in some sense of \u2018directly\u2019,\nso we don\u2019t have intuitive, i.e., sense-derived knowledge of them. Or\nhe could have said that ontological neutrality about structure and\ncomposition is compatible with knowledge of function. As we saw, Kant\u2019s\nconception of the mind is functionalist\u2014to understand the mind,\nwe must study what it does and can do, its functions\u2014and the\ndoctrine that function does not dictate form is at the heart of\ncontemporary functionalism. According to functionalism, we can gain\nknowledge of the mind\u2019s functions while knowing little or nothing about\nhow the mind is built. Approached this way, Kant\u2019s view that we know\nnothing of the structure and composition of the mind would\njust be a radical version of this functionalist idea. Either move would\nrestore consistency among his various claims about knowledge of the\nmind.\n6. Where Kant Has and Has Not Influenced Contemporary Cognitive Research\n\n\nWe will close by returning to the question of Kant\u2019s relationship to\ncontemporary cognitive research. As we saw, some of Kant\u2019s most\ncharacteristic doctrines about the mind are now built into the very\nfoundations of cognitive science. We laid out what they were.\nInterestingly, some of the others have played little or no role.\n\n\nConsider the two forms of Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept. In\nthe form of binding, the phenomenon that he had in mind in the first\nkind of synthesis is now widely studied. Indeed, one model, Anne\nTreisman\u2019s (1980) three-stage model, is very similar to all three\nstages of synthesis in Kant. According to Treisman and her colleagues,\nobject recognition proceeds in three stages: first feature detection,\nthen location of features on a map of locations, and then integration\nand identification of objects under concepts. This compares directly to\nKant\u2019s three-stage model of apprehension of features, association of\nfeatures (reproduction), and recognition of integrated groups of under\nconcepts (A98-A106). However, Kant\u2019s second kind of recognition under\nconcepts, the activity of tying multiple representations together into\na global representation (A107\u201314), has received little attention.\n\n\nThe same was true until recently of the\n unity of consciousness\n and Kant\u2019s work on it. However, this is changing. In the past twenty\nyears, the unity of consciousness has come back onto the research\nagenda and there are now hundreds of papers and a number of books on\nthe topic. However, claims such as Kant\u2019s that a certain form of\nsynthesis and certain links among the contents of experience are\nrequired for unity continue to be ignored in cognitive science, though\na few philosophers have done some work on them (Brook 2004). The same\nis true of Kant\u2019s views on consciousness of self; cognitive science\nhas paid no attention to non-ascriptive identification of self and the\nidea of the essential indexical. Here, too, a few philosophers have\nworked on these issues, apparently without knowing of Kant\u2019s\ncontribution (Brook & DeVidi, 2001), but not cognitive\nscientists.\n\n\nIn short, the dominant model of the mind in contemporary cognitive\nscience is Kantian, but some of his most distinctive contributions have\nnot been taken into it (Brook, 2004).",
