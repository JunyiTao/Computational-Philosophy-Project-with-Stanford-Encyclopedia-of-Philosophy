    "main_text": "Brouwer\u2019s Later Refinements and Applications, 1921\u20131955 || The Implicit Proof Interpretation\n3.1 The Implicit Proof Interpretation\n\nThree examples can be given that show that by the mid-1920s, Brouwer\nin practice worked with the hypothetical judgement and with the clause\nfor implication in the Proof Interpretation (which was published\nlater): an equivalence in propositional logic, the proof of the bar\ntheorem, and his reading of ordering axioms.\n3.1.1 An equivalence in propositional logic\n\nIn a lecture in 1923, Brouwer presented a proof of \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1925E: 253 [Mancosu 1998:\n 291]).[8]\n This equivalence is the one theorem in propositional logic that\nBrouwer ever published. The argument begins by pointing out that \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) implies that \\(\\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A\\) (because\n\\(\\neg B\\) is \\(B \\rightarrow \\bot\\) and the two implications can be\ncomposed because the consequent of the one is the antecedent of the\nother). It would not have been possible for Brouwer to make this\ninference if at the time it would have been among his proof conditions\nof an implication to have a proof of the antecedent, as then a proof\nof \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) would lead to a proof of \\(B\\)\nand thereby make it impossible to begin establishing the second\nimplication by proving its antecedent \\(\\neg B\\).\n\nLater, Brouwer pointed out the following consequence of the validity\nof \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A \\leftrightarrow \\neg A\\): the proof method of\nreductio ad absurdum can be used to establish negative\npropositions \\(\\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1929A: 163 [Mancosu 1998: 52]). For\nif the assumption of \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) leads to a contradiction, that\nis, to \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A\\), the equivalence allows one to simplify\nthat to \\(\\neg A\\). On the other hand, reductio ad absurdum\nin general cannot be used to establish positive propositions \\(A\\);\nthe derivation of a contradiction from the\nassumption \\(\\neg A\\) only leads to \\(\\neg \\neg A\\), which\nintuitionistically is weaker than \\(A.\\)\n3.1.2 The proof of the bar theorem\n\nBrouwer\u2019s bar theorem is crucial to intuitionistic analysis; for\na detailed explanation of the notions involved and of Brouwer\u2019s\nproof, see Heyting 1956 (Ch. 3), Parsons 1967, and van Atten 2004b\n(Ch. 4). Here we will rather be concerned with the logical\naspects.\n\nBrouwer\u2019s proof of the bar theorem from 1924 (later versions of\nthe proof appeared in 1927 and in 1954) proves a statement of the form\n\u201cIf \\(A\\) has been demonstrated, then \\(B\\)\nis demonstrable\u201d (Brouwer 1924D1, 1927B,\n1954A). This would evidently not be an implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nif the latter were understood as a transformation of the proof\nconditions of \\(A\\) into those of \\(B\\),\nbecause in the former case there is the additional\ninformation that, by hypothesis, \\(A\\) has been\ndemonstrated. In other words, we have, by hypothesis, a concrete proof\nof \\(A\\) at hand. (However, both are hypothetical\njudgements in the sense that neither requires that we actually have\ndemonstrated \\(A\\).) It may be possible to exploit this\nextra information, and below it will be indicated how Brouwer did\nthis. (Heyting in 1956 also chose to understand implication in this\nstronger sense, that is, in terms of assertion conditions;\nsee\n section 5.4\n below.)\n\nA simple but relevant version of the bar theorem (for the universal\ntree over the natural numbers, T) would be:\n\n\nIf it has been demonstrated that every path through \\(T\\)\nintersects a given set of nodes \\(B\\),\nthen it can be demonstrated that every path through \\(T\\)\nhas a node in common with a set of nodes \\(B\u2032\\)\nthat can be\n well-ordered.[9]\n\n\nSets like \\(B\\) and \\(B\u2032\\) are\ncalled bars. Brouwer first formulates a condition for any\ndemonstration that may be found of the proposition \u201cTree \\(T\\)\ncontains a bar\u201d. This condition is that any\ndemonstration of that proposition must be analyzable into a certain\ncanonical form. Brouwer then gives a method to transform any such\ndemonstration, when analyzed into that canonical form, into a\nmathematical construction that makes the proposition \u201c\\(T\\)\ncontains a well-ordered bar\u201d, true, thereby\nestablishing the consequent. This strategy clearly shows that\nBrouwer\u2019s operative explanation of the meaning of \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) was a version of clause (H3) of the Proof\nInterpretation as formulated in the Introduction, if we understand\n\u201cproof\u201d in that clause as \u201cdemonstration\u201d.\n\nA demonstration or concrete proof of the antecedent, be it an actual\nor a hypothetical one, is required to obtain a canonical form. The\nreason is that the existence of a canonical proof of a proposition \\(A\\)\ncannot be logically derived from the mere proof\nconditions of \\(A\\), as the form such a canonical proof\ntakes may well depend on specific non-logical details of mathematical\nconstructions for \\(A\\).\n\nIn Brouwer\u2019s proof of the bar theorem, the applicability of the\ntransformation method to any demonstration of the antecedent is\nguaranteed by the fact that the condition on such demonstrations that\nhe formulates is a necessary condition. Brouwer obtained this\nnecessary condition by exploiting the fact that on his conception,\nmathematical objects, so in particular trees and bars, are mental\nobjects; this opens the possibility that reflection on the way these\nobjects and their properties are constructed in mental acts provides\ninformation on them that can be put to mathematical use, in particular\nif this information consists in constraints on these acts of\nconstruction. This is how Brouwer arrived at his canonical form. In\neffect, Brouwer\u2019s argument for the bar theorem is a\ntranscendental argument. On other conceptions of mathematics such\nconsiderations need not be acceptable, and indeed no proofs of the\n(classically valid) bar theorem are known in other varieties of\nconstructive mathematics (where bar induction is either accepted as an\naxiom, a possibility that Brouwer had also suggested (Brouwer 1927B:\n63n.7 [van Heijenoort 1967: 460n.7]), or not accepted, as in the\nMarkov School).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of this matter, see Sundholm and van\nAtten 2008.\n3.1.3 Ordering axioms\n\nAround 1925, Brouwer introduced the notion of \u201cvirtual\nordering\u201d. A (partial) ordering \\(\\lt\\) is virtual if it\nsatisfies the following axioms (Brouwer 1926A: 453):\n\nThe relations \\(r = s, r \\lt s\\) and \\(r \\gt s\\) are mutually\nexclusive.\nFrom \\(r = u, s = v\\) and \\(r \\lt s\\) follows \\(u \\lt v\\).\nFrom the simultaneous failure of the relations \\(r \\gt s\\) and \\(r\n= s\\) follows \\(r \\lt s\\).\nFrom the simultaneous failure of the relations \\(r \\gt s\\) and \\(r\n\\lt s\\) follows \\(r = s\\).\nFrom \\(r \\lt s\\) and \\(s \\lt t\\) follows \\(r \\lt t\\).\n\n\nIn a lecture course on Order Types in 1925, of which David van\nDantzig\u2019s notes are preserved in the Brouwer Archive, Brouwer\ncommented:\n\n\nThe axioms II through V are to be understood in the constructive\nsense: if the premisses of the axiom are satisfied, the virtually\nordered set should provide a construction for the order condition in\nthe conclusion. (van Dalen 2008: 19)\n\n\nThis is a clear instance of the clause for implication in the Proof\nInterpretation. Note that Brouwer did not include this elucidation in\nthe published paper (1926A), nor in later presentations.\n3.2 Widening the Scope of the Weak Counterexamples\n\nAs we saw above, in the paper from 1908 Brouwer had given weak\ncounterexamples to PEM. In the 1920s Brouwer developed a general\ntechnique for constructing weak counterexamples which also made it\npossible to widen their scope and include principles of analysis. The\ndevelopment began in 1921, when Brouwer gave a weak counterexample to\nthe proposition that every real number has a decimal expansion\n(Brouwer 1921A). The argument proceeded by defining real numbers whose\ndecimal developments are dependent on specific open problems\nconcerning the decimal development of \\(\\pi\\). Brouwer closed by\nobserving that, should these open problems be solved, then other real\nnumbers without decimal expansion can be defined (Brouwer 1921A: 210\n[Mancosu 1998: 34]). The general technique was made explicit in a\nlecture from 1923 (Brouwer 1924N: 3 and footnote 4 [van Heijenoort\n1967: 337 and footnote 5]) and reached its perfection with the\n\u201coscillatory number\u201d method in the first Vienna lecture in\n1928 (Brouwer 1929A: 161 [Mancosu 1998: 51]). The method involves the\nreduction of the validity of a mathematical principle to the\nsolvability of an open problem of the following type: we have a\ndecidable property \\(P\\) (defined on the natural\nnumbers) for which we have as yet shown neither \\(\\exists xP(x)\\) nor\n\\(\\forall x\\neg P(x)\\). This reduction is carried out in such a way\nthat it only uses the fact that \\(P\\) induces an open\nproblem of this type, and does not depend on the exact definition of\n\\(P\\); that is, if the open problem is solved, one can\nsimply replace it by another one of the same type, and exactly the\nsame reduction still works. This uniformity means that, as long as\nthere are open problems of this type at all (and this is practically\ncertain at any time), there is no intuitionistic proof of the general\nmathematical principle in question. In the 1920s, Brouwer constructed\nweak counterexamples to the following general mathematical\npropositions, among others (where \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) stands for the set of\nintuitionistic real numbers, and \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) for the set of\nrationals):\n\nThe continuum is totally ordered (Brouwer 1924N)\nEvery set is either finite or infinite (Brouwer 1924N)\nThe Heine-Borel theorem (Brouwer 1924N)\n\\(\\forall x \\in \\mathbf{R}(x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\vee x \\not\\in\n\\mathbf{Q})\\) (Brouwer 1925E)\nAny two straight lines in the Euclidean plane are either parallel,\nor coincide, or intersect (Brouwer 1929A)\nEvery infinite sequence of positive numbers either converges or\ndiverges (Brouwer 1929A)\n\n3.3 Strong Counterexamples and the Creating Subject\n\nA weak counterexample shows that we cannot at present prove some\nproposition, but it does not actually refute it; in that sense, it is\nnot a counterexample proper. From 1928 on, Brouwer devised a number of\nstrong counterexamples to classically valid propositions, that is, he\nshowed that these propositions were contradictory. This should be\nunderstood as follows: if one keeps to the letter of the classical\nprinciple but in its interpretation substitutes intuitionistic notions\nfor their classical counterparts, one arrives intuitionistically at a\ncontradiction. So Brouwer\u2019s strong counterexamples are no more\ncounterexamples in the strict sense of the word than his weak\ncounterexamples are (but for a different reason). One way of looking\nat strong counterexamples is that they are non-interpretability\nresults.\n\nThat strong counterexamples to classical principles are possible at\nall is explained as follows. As mentioned, on the intuitionistic\nunderstanding, logic is subordinate to mathematics, whereas\nclassically it is the other way around. Hence, if intuitionistic\nmathematics contains objects and principles that do not figure in\nclassical mathematics, it may come about that intuitionistic logic,\nwhich then depends also on these non-classical elements, is no proper\npart of classical logic.\n\nBrouwer\u2019s first strong counterexample was published in Brouwer\n1928A2, where he showed: \n\n\\[ \\neg \\forall x\\in \\mathbf{R}(x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\vee x \\not\\in \\mathbf{Q}) \\]\n\n\nThis is a strengthening of the corresponding weak counterexample from\n1923, but the argument is entirely different. The strong\ncounterexample depends on the theorem in intuitionistic analysis,\nobtained in 1924 and improved in 1927, that all total functions\n\\([0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\) are uniformly continuous. The\nnon-classical elements in that theorem are the conception of the\ncontinuum as a spread of choice sequences, and the bar theorem based\non it (for further explanations of this conception, see Heyting 1956\n(Ch.3) and van Atten 2004b (Chs.3 and\n 4)).[10]\n\nFrom 1948 on, Brouwer also published counterexamples that are based on\nso-called \u201ccreating subject methods\u201d. (He mentions in\nBrouwer 1948A that he has been using this method in lectures since\n1927.) Their characteristic property is that they make explicit\nreference to the subject who carries out the mathematical\nconstructions, to the temporal structure of its activities, and the\nrelation of this structure to the intuitionistic notion of truth.\nThese methods can be used to generate weak as well as strong\ncounterexamples. (In the earlier \u201coscillatory number\u201d\nmethod for generating weak counterexamples, the creating subject is\nnot explicitly referred to.)\n\nUsing creating subject methods, Brouwer showed, for instance,\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\neg \\forall x & \\in \\mathbf{R}(\\neg \\neg x \\gt 0 \\rightarrow x \\gt 0) & \\textrm{(Brouwer 1949A)}\\\\ \\neg \\forall x & \\in \\mathbf{R}(x \\ne 0 \\rightarrow x \\lt 0 \\vee x \\gt 0) & \\textrm{(Brouwer 1949B)} \\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nThe actual arguments using these methods introduce no new logical\nphenomena as such\u2014weak and strong counterexamples can also be\ngiven by other means. For the moment, we refer to the literature for\nfurther details: Brouwer 1949A, 1949B, 1954F; Heyting 1956:\n117\u2013120; Myhill 1966; Dummett 2000: 244\u2013245; van Atten\n2018. But we do note here one particular aspect of this method. It\nseems to introduce a further notion of negation, by accepting that, if\nit is known that the creating subject will never prove \\(A\\),\nthen \\(A\\) is false. But this is\nactually no different from the notion of negation as impossibility.\nHeuristically, this can be seen as follows: given the freedom the\ncreating subject has to construct whatever it can, the only way to\nshow that there can be no moment at which the subject demonstrates \\(A\\)\nis to show that a demonstration of \\(A\\)\nitself is impossible. An actual justification of the\nprinciple is this: If the creating subject demonstrates a proposition\n\\(A\\), it does so at a particular moment \\(n\\);\nso, by contraposition, if it is contradictory that\nthere exists a moment \\(n\\) at which the subject\ndemonstrates \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is\n contradictory.[11]\n3.4 The Classification of Propositions\n\nIn Brouwer 1955, the four possible cases a proposition \\(\\alpha\\) may\nbe in at any particular moment are made explicit:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) has been proved to be true;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has been proved to be false, i.e., absurd;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has neither been proved to be true nor to be absurd,\nbut an algorithm is known leading to a decision either that \\(\\alpha\\)\nis true or that \\(\\alpha\\) is absurd;\n\\(\\alpha\\) has neither been proved to be true nor to be absurd,\nnor do we know an algorithm leading to the statement either that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is true or that \\(\\alpha\\) is absurd.\n\n\nIn a lecture from 1951, Brouwer lists only cases 1, 2, and 4 from the\nabove list, adding that case 3 \u201cobviously is reducible to the\nfirst and second cases\u201d (Brouwer 1981A: 92). That remark\nemphasizes an important idealization permitted in intuitionistic\nmathematics: we may make the idealization that, once we have obtained\na decision method for a specific proposition, we also know its\noutcome.\n\nBrouwer also adds that a proposition for which case 4 holds may at\nsome point pass to another case, either because we have in the\nmeantime found a decision method, or because the objects involved in\nproposition \\(\\alpha\\) in the meantime have acquired further\nproperties that permit to make the decision (as may happen for\npropositions about choice sequences).\n3.5 Brouwer\u2019s View on the Formalist Program and G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems\n\nIn 1908, Brouwer had shown that \\(\\neg \\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\); in 1923,\nwhen Hilbert\u2019s program was in full swing, this result inspired\nBrouwer to say that \u201cWe need by no means despair of reaching\nthis goal [of a consistency proof for formalized mathematics]\u201d;\nsee section 2.1 above for the\n full quotation.\n (At the time, Brouwer suspected that \\(\\neg \\neg A \\rightarrow A\\)\nwas weaker than PEM; Bernays quickly corrected this impression in a\nletter to Brouwer (Brouwer 1925E: 252n.4 [Mancosu 1998: 292n.4]).)\n\nIn 1928, he added to this the consistency of finite conjunctions of\ninstances of PEM, and considered these results to \u201coffer some\nencouragement\u201d for the formalist project of a consistency proof\n(Brouwer 1928A2: 377 [Mancosu 1998:\n 43]).[12]\n The strongest statement based on these results he made at the end of\nthe first Vienna lecture from 1928:\n\n\nAn appropriate mechanization of the language of this\nintuitionistically non-contradictory mathematics should therefore\ndeliver precisely what the formalist school has set as its goal.\n(Brouwer 1929A: 164; translation mine)\n\n\nBut, for reasons explained above, such a consistency proof would have\nno mathematical value for Brouwer; and the best a classical\nmathematician can be said to be doing, according to the view Brouwer\nsketches, is to be giving relative consistency proofs.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems showed that Hilbert\u2019s\nProgram, in its most ambitious form, cannot succeed. Brouwer\u2019s\nassistant Hurewicz discussed the incompleteness theorem in a seminar\n(van Dalen 2005: 674n.7). There is no comment from Brouwer on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s first theorem in print; on the other hand, he\nclearly had the second theorem in mind when he wrote, in 1952,\nthat\n\n\nThe hope originally fostered by the Old Formalists that mathematical\nscience erected according to their principles would be crowned one day\nwith a proof of non-contradictority, was never fulfilled, and,\nnowadays, in view of the results of certain investigations of the last\nfew decades, has, I think, been relinquished. (Brouwer 1952B: 508)\n\n\nHao Wang reports:\n\n\nIn the spring of 1961 I visited Brouwer at his home. He discoursed\nwidely on many subjects. Among other things he said that he did not\nthink G\u2019s incompleteness results are as important as\nHeyting\u2019s formalization of intuitionistic reasoning, because to\nhim G\u2019s results are obvious (obviously true). (Wang 1987:\n 88)[13]\n\n\nWith respect to the first incompleteness theorem, Brouwer\u2019s\nreaction is readily understandable. Already in his dissertation, he\nhad noted that the totality of all possible mathematical constructions\nis \u201cdenumerably unfinished\u201d; by this he meant that\n\n\nwe can never construct in a well-defined way more than a denumerable\nsubset of it, but when we have constructed such a subset, we can\nimmediately deduce from it, following some previously defined\nmathematical process, new elements which are counted to the original\nset. (Brouwer 1907: 148 [1975: 82])\n\n\nAnd in one of the notebooks leading up to his dissertation, he stated\nthat \u201cThe totality of mathematical theorems is, among other\nthings, also a set which is denumerable but never\n finished\u201d.[14]\n\nIndeed, according to Carnap, it had been an argument of\nBrouwer\u2019s that had stimulated G\u00f6del in finding the first\ntheorem. In a diary note for December 12, 1929, Carnap states that\nG\u00f6del talked to him that day\n\n\nabout the inexhaustibility of mathematics (see separate sheet). He was\nstimulated to this idea by Brouwer\u2019s Vienna lecture. Mathematics\nis not completely formalizable. He appears to be right. (Wang 1987:\n84)\n\n\nOn the \u201cseparate sheet\u201d, Carnap wrote down what G\u00f6del\nhad told him:\n\n\nWe admit as legitimate mathematics certain reflections on the grammar\nof a language that concerns the empirical. If one seeks to formalize\nsuch a mathematics, then with each formalization there are problems,\nwhich one can understand and express in ordinary language, but cannot\nexpress in the given formalized language. It follows (Brouwer) that\nmathematics is inexhaustible: one must always again draw afresh from\nthe \u201cfountain of intuition\u201d. There is, therefore, no\ncharacteristica universalis for the whole mathematics, and no\ndecision procedure for the whole mathematics. In each and every\nclosed language there are only countably many expressions.\nThe continuum appears only in \u201cthe whole of\nmathematics\u201d \u2026 If we have only one language, and\ncan only make \u201celucidations\u201d about it, then these\nelucidations are inexhaustible, they always require some new intuition\nagain. (As quoted, in translation, in Wang 1987: 50)\n\n\nThis record contains in particular elements from the second of\nBrouwer\u2019s two lectures in Vienna, in which one finds the\nargument that G\u00f6del refers to: on the one hand, the full\ncontinuum is given in a priori intuition, while on the other hand, it\ncannot be exhausted by a language with countably many expressions\n(Brouwer 1930A: 3, 6 [Mancosu 1998: 56, 58]).\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem, on the other hand, must have\nsurprised Brouwer, given his optimism in the 1920s about the formalist\nschool achieving its aim of proving the consistency of formalized\nclassical mathematics (see the quotation at the beginning of this\nsubsection).\n\nIn his final original published paper (1955), Brouwer was, in his own\nway, quite positive about the study of classical logic. After showing\nthat various principles from the algebraic tradition in logic (e.g.,\nBoole, Schr\u00f6der) are intuitionistically contradictory, he\ncontinues:\n\n\nFortunately classical algebra of logic has its merits quite apart from\nthe question of its applicability to mathematics. Not only as a formal\nimage of the technique of common-sensical thinking has it reached a\nhigh degree of perfection, but also in itself, as an edifice of\nthought, it is a thing of exceptional harmony and beauty. Indeed, its\nsuccessor, the sumptuous symbolic logic of the twentieth century which\nat present is continually raising the most captivating problems and\nmaking the most surprising and penetrating discoveries, likewise is\nfor a great part cultivated for its own sake. (Brouwer 1955: 116)\n\n3.6 Brouwer\u2019s Logic and the Grundlagenstreit\n\nBrouwer\u2019s logic has played a role in the Grundlagenstreit (the\nFoundational Debate) only to the extent that this logic could be seen\nas a fragment of classical logic. Constructive logic in that sense was\na success, and (with a different meaning) it became fundamental to\nHilbert\u2019s Program as well. On the other hand, phenomena specific\nto Brouwer\u2019s full conception of logic, in particular the strong\ncounterexamples, played no role in the Foundational Debate whatsoever.\nThe main reason for this may be that, in their dependence on choice\nsequences, they use objects that are not acceptable in classical\nmathematics. (A more subtle matter is whether they are acceptable in\nHilbert\u2019s finitary mathematics. According to Bernays, Hilbert\nnever took a position on choice sequences (G\u00f6del 2003a: 279), and\nmore generally never read Brouwer\u2019s papers (van Dalen 2005:\n 637).[15])\n In addition, Brouwer did not announce the existence of strong\ncounterexamples in a loud or polemical way; and when in 1954 he\nfinally did publish (in English) a paper with a polemical\ntitle\u2014\u201cAn example of contradictority in classical theory\nof functions\u201d\u2014the Foundational Debate was, in the social\nsense, long over. Intuitionistic logic and mathematics had been widely\naccepted to the extent that they could be seen as the constructive\npart of classical mathematics, while the typically intuitionistic\ninnovations were ignored. It is not surprising, then, that the\npresentation of the strong counterexamples in the 1950s did not at all\nlead to a reopening of the debate. For further discussion of this\nmatter, see Hesseling 2003 and van Atten 2004a.\n4. Early Partial Formalizations and Metamathematics\n\nAs Brouwer was more interested in developing pure mathematics than in\ndeveloping logic, which for him was a form of applied mathematics, he\nnever made an extensive study of the latter. In particular, he never\nmade a systematic comparison of intuitionistic logic and classical\nlogic as formalized, for example, in Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead & Russell 1910) or by the Hilbert school (Hilbert 1923;\nHilbert & Ackermann 1928). What motivated others to make such\ncomparisons was the publication by Brouwer in international journals\nof weak counterexamples that showed how these also affected very\ngeneral mathematical principles such as trichotomy for real numbers\n(see above,\n section 3.2).\n\nClearly, to make a systematic comparison possible, one needs a\ncodification of intuitionistic logic in a formal system. On the\nintuitionistic view that cannot exist, as logic is as open-ended as\nthe mathematics it depends on. But one may formalize fragments of\nintuitionistic logic. The relevant papers here are Kolmogorov 1925,\nHeyting 1928 (unpublished), Glivenko 1928, Glivenko 1929, and Heyting\n 1930.[16]\n But perhaps the first to give systematic thought to the matter was\nPaul Bernays. In a letter to Heyting of November 5, 1930, he\nwrote:\n\n\nThe lectures that Prof. Brouwer at the time held in G\u00f6ttingen\n(for the first time) [1924 (van Dalen 2001: 305)], led me to the\nquestion how a Brouwerian propositional logic could be separated out,\nand I arrived at the result that this can be done by leaving out the\nsingle formula \\(\\neg \\neg a \\supset a\\) (in your symbolism). I then\nalso wrote to Prof. Brouwer [correcting Brouwer\u2019s impression at\nthe time that this formula is weaker than PEM]. (Troelstra 1990:\n 8)[17]\n\n\n(Bernays\u2019 correction was included, at the proof stage, in\nBrouwer\u2019s paper (1925E: 252n.4 [Mancosu 1998: 292n.4]).)\nHowever, Bernays did not publish his idea for a Brouwerian logic.\n(Kolmogorov would publish the same idea in 1925; see below.)\n\nIn setting up a formal system to capture, albeit necessarily only in\npart, logic as it figures in Brouwer\u2019s foundations, naturally\nsome priorly obtained meaning explanation is needed to serve as the\ncriterion for intuitionistic validity. Yet none of the papers by\nKolmogorov, Heyting, and Glivenko just mentioned made an explicit\ncontribution to the meaning explanation of intuitionistic logic. As we\nwill see, the explanations as given in the papers (which is not\nnecessarily all their respective authors had in mind) were too vague\nfor that. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the systems were\nnot equivalent; notably, Kolmogorov rejected Ex Falso, while\nHeyting and Glivenko accepted it. We will now discuss these papers in\nturn.\n4.1 Kolmogorov 1925\n\nIn 1925, Andrei Kolmogorov, at the age of 22, published the first\n(partial) formalization of intuitionistic logic, and also made an\nextensive comparison with formalized classical logic, in a paper\ncalled \u201cOn the principle of the excluded middle\u201d. As van\nDalen has suggested (Hesseling 2003: 237), Kolmogorov probably had\ncome into contact with intuitionism through Alexandrov or Urysohn, who\nwere close friends of Brouwer\u2019s. Kolmogorov was in any case\nremarkably well-informed, citing even papers that had only appeared in\nthe Dutch-language \u201cVerhandelingen\u201d of the Dutch Academy\nof Sciences (Brouwer 1918B, 1919A, 1921A).\n\nThe task Kolmogorov set himself in the paper is to explain why\n\u201cthe illegitimate use of the principle of the excluded\nmiddle\u201d as revealed in Brouwer\u2019s writings \u201chas not\nyet led to contradictions and also why the very illegitimacy has often\ngone unnoticed\u201d (van Heijenoort 1967: 416). In effect, as other\npassages make clear (van Heijenoort 1967: 429\u2013430), the\n(unachieved) aim is to show that classical mathematics is translatable\ninto intuitionistic mathematics, and thereby give a consistency proof\nof classical mathematics relative to intuitionistic mathematics.\n\nThe technical result established in the paper is: Classical\npropositional logic is interpretable in an intuitionistically\nacceptable fragment of it. The intuitionistic fragment, called\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (presumably for \u201cBrouwer\u201d) is:\n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\tag{1} A & \\rightarrow(B \\rightarrow A)\\\\ \\tag{2} (A \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow B)) & \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow B)\\\\ \\tag{3} (A \\rightarrow(B \\rightarrow C)) & \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow C))\\\\ \\tag{4} (B \\rightarrow C) & \\rightarrow((A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow C))\\\\ \\tag{5} (A \\rightarrow B) & \\rightarrow((A \\rightarrow \\neg B) \\rightarrow \\neg A)\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nThe system \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) (presumably for \u201cHilbert\u201d)\nconsists of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and the additional axiom \n\n\\[\\tag{6} \\neg \\neg A \\rightarrow A \\]\n\n\nIn both systems, the rules are modus ponens and substitution.\n\nKolmogorov then indicates and partially carries out a proof that\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is equivalent to the system for classical propositional\nlogic presented by Hilbert in Hilbert 1923. Then Kolmogorov devises\nthe following translation \\(^*\\): \n\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A^* & = \\neg \\neg A & \\textrm{for atomic } A\\\\ F(\\phi_1, \\phi_2 ,\\ldots ,\\phi_k)^* & = \\neg \\neg F(\\phi_{1}^*, \\phi_{2}^*,\\ldots ,\\phi_{k}^*) & \\textrm{ for composed formulas} \\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nand proves this interpretability result: \n\n\\[ \\textrm{If } U \\vdash_{\\mathbf{H}} \\phi \\textrm{ then } U^* \\vdash_{\\mathbf{B}} \\phi^* \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(U\\) is a set of axioms of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), and\n\\(U^*\\) the set of its translations (which Kolmogorov shows to be\nderivable in \\(\\mathbf{B})\\).\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s technical result anticipated G\u00f6del\u2019s and\nGentzen\u2019s \u201cdouble negation translations\u201d for\narithmetic (see below), all the more so since he also made quite\nconcrete suggestions how to treat predicate logic. As Hesseling (2003:\n239) points out, however, to see Kolmogorov\u2019s result as a\ntranslation into intuitionistic mathematics is slightly different from\nhis own way of seeing it. Kolmogorov saw it as a translation into a\ndomain of \u201cpseudomathematics\u201d; but although he did not\nexplicitly identify that as part of intuitionistic mathematics, he\ncould have done so.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s strategy to obtain a (fragment) of formalized\nintuitionistic logic was to start with a classical system and isolate\nan intuitionistically acceptable system from it. (Note that, although\nKolmogorov refers to Principia Mathematica, he did not take\nit as his point of departure.) This might (roughly) be described as\nthe method of crossing out, which is also what Heyting would do in\n1928 (see below). Given the task Kolmogorov set himself, it is a\nnatural approach. Kolmogorov\u2019s criterion whether to keep an\naxiom was whether a proposition has an \u201cintuitive\nfoundation\u201d or \u201cpossesses intuitive obviousness\u201d\n(van Heijenoort 1967: 421, 422); on implication he said,\n\n\nThe meaning of the symbol \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is exhausted by the fact\nthat, once convinced of the truth of \\(A\\), we have to\naccept the truth of \\(B\\) too. (van Heijenoort 1967:\n420)\n\n\nNo more precise indications are given, so in that sense the paper did\nlittle to explain the meaning of intuitionistic logic.\n\nEx Falso was excluded from this fragment: Kolmogorov said\nthat, just like PEM, Ex Falso \u201chas no intuitive\nfoundation\u201d (van Heijenoort 1967: 419). In particular, he says\nthat Ex Falso is unacceptable for the reason that it asserts\nsomething about the consequences of something impossible (van\nHeijenoort 1967: 421). Note that that is a very strong rejection: it\nnot only rules out Ex Falso in its full generality, but also\nspecific instances such as \u201cIf 3.15 is an initial segment of\n\\(\\pi\\), then 3.1 is an initial segment of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d. It also\nindicates an incoherence in Kolmogorov\u2019s position: one cannot at\nthe same time accept \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow A)\\) as an axiom\nand deny that anything can be asserted about the consequences of an\nimpossible \\(B\\).\n\nAs van Dalen notes, it is not known whether Kolmogorov sent his paper\nto Brouwer (van Dalen 2005: 555). The contents of the paper seem to\nhave remained largely unknown outside the Soviet Union for years.\nGlivenko mentioned the paper in a letter to Heyting of October 13,\n1928, as did Kolmogorov in an undated letter to Heyting of 1933 or\nlater (Troelstra 1990: 16); but in Heyting 1934 it is, unlike\nKolmogorov\u2019s later paper from 1932, neither discussed nor\nincluded in the bibliography. The volume of the Jahrbuch \u00fcber\ndie Fortschritte der Mathematik covering 1925, which included a\nvery short notice on Kolmogorov 1925 by V. Smirnov (Leningrad),\nwasn\u2019t actually published until 1932 (Smirnov 1925).\n4.2 Heyting 1928\n\nWhile Kolmogorov\u2019s work remained unknown in the West, an\nindependent initiative towards the formalization of intuitionistic\nlogic and mathematics was taken in 1927, when the Dutch Mathematical\nSociety chose to pose the following problem for its annual\ncontest:\n\n\nBy its very nature, Brouwer\u2019s set theory cannot be identified\nwith the conclusions formally derivable in a certain pasigraphic\nsystem [i.e., universal notation system]. Nevertheless certain\nregularities may be observed in the language which Brouwer uses to\ngive expression to his mathematical intuition; these regularities may\nbe codified in a formal mathematical system. It is asked to\n\nconstruct such a system and to indicate its deviations from\nBrouwer\u2019s theories;\nto investigate whether from the system to be constructed a dual\nsystem may be obtained by (formally) interchanging the principium\ntertii exclusi and the principium contradictionis.\n(Troelstra 1990: 4)\n\n\n\nThe question had been formulated by Brouwer\u2019s friend, colleague,\nand former teacher Gerrit Mannoury, who asked Brouwer\u2019s opinion\non it beforehand in a letter (Brouwer was in\n Berlin);[18]\n unfortunately, no reply from Brouwer has been found, but the final\nformulation was the same as in Mannoury\u2019s letter.\n\nBrouwer\u2019s former student Arend Heyting, who had graduated (cum\nlaude) in 1925 with a dissertation on intuitionistic projective\ngeometry, wrote what turned out to be the one submission (Hesseling\n2003: 274). The original manuscript seems no longer to exist, but it\nis known that its telling motto was \u201cStones for\n bread\u201d.[19]\n In 1928, the jury crowned Heyting\u2019s\n work,[20]\n stating that it was \u201ca formalization carried out in a most\nknowledgeable way and with admirable perseverance\u201d (Hesseling\n2003: 274; translation modified).\n\nHeyting\u2019s essay covered propositional logic, predicate logic,\narithmetic, and Brouwerian set theory or analysis. One would think\nthat, to be able to achieve this, Heyting must have had quite precise\nideas on how to explain the logical connectives intuitionistically.\nHowever, Heyting\u2019s correspondence with Freudenthal in 1930 shows\nthat before 1930, Heyting had not yet arrived at the explicit\nrequirement of a transformation procedure in the explanation of\nimplication (see the\n quotation\n in\n section 5.1\n below).\n\nSince the original manuscript seems not to have survived, a discussion\nof Heyting\u2019s work must take the revised and published version\nfrom 1930 as its point of departure; see below.\n\nHeyting sent his manuscript to Brouwer, who replied in a letter of\nJuly 17, 1928, that he had found it \u201cextraordinarily\ninteresting\u201d, and continued:\n\n\nBy now I have already begun to appreciate your work so much, that I\nshould like to request that you revise it in German for the\nMathematische Annalen (preferably somewhat extended rather than\n shortened).[21]\n\n\nInterestingly, Brouwer also suggested (with an eye on the\nformalization of the theory of choice sequences)\n\n\nAnd, with an eye on \u00a713, perhaps also the notion of\n\u201claw\u201d can be formalized.\n\n\nIt seems, however, that Heyting made no effort in that direction.\n\nHeyting\u2019s paper would indeed be published soon after, in 1930;\nnot in the Mathematische Annalen, as Brouwer by then was no\nlonger on its editorial board, but in the proceedings of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences. However, Heyting\u2019s work became known\nalready before its publication. Heyting mentioned it in correspondence\nwith Glivenko in 1928 (see below), Tarski and \u0141ukasiewicz talked\nabout it to Bernays at the Bologna conference in 1928, and Church\nmentioned it in a letter to Errera in 1929 (Hesseling 2003: 274).\n4.3 Glivenko 1928 and 1929\n\nIn reaction to Barzin and Errera, who had argued that Brouwer\u2019s\nlogic was three-valued and moreover that this led to it being\ninconsistent, Valerii\n Glivenko[22]\n in 1928 set out to prove them wrong by formal means. He gave the\nfollowing list of axioms for intuitionistic propositional logic:\n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\tag{1} p &\\rightarrow p\\\\ \\tag{2} (p \\rightarrow q) &\\rightarrow((q \\rightarrow r) \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow r))\\\\ \\tag{3} (p \\wedge q) &\\rightarrow p\\\\ \\tag{4} (p \\wedge q) &\\rightarrow q\\\\ \\tag{5} (r \\rightarrow p) &\\rightarrow((r \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow(r \\rightarrow(p \\wedge q)))\\\\ \\tag{6} p &\\rightarrow(p \\vee q)\\\\ \\tag{7} q &\\rightarrow(p \\vee q)\\\\ \\tag{8} \\label{GlivAxiom8} (p \\rightarrow r) &\\rightarrow ((q \\rightarrow r) \\rightarrow((p \\vee q) \\rightarrow r))\\\\ \\tag{9} (p \\rightarrow q) &\\rightarrow((p \\rightarrow \\neg q) \\rightarrow \\neg p)\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nFrom these axioms, he then proved \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\tag{1} \\neg \\neg(p \\vee \\neg p)\\\\ \\tag{2} \\neg \\neg \\neg p & \\rightarrow \\neg p\\\\ \\tag{3} ((\\neg p \\vee p) \\rightarrow \\neg q) & \\rightarrow \\neg q\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nThe first two had already informally been argued for by Brouwer\n(1908C, 1925E); the third was new. Now suppose that in intuitionistic\nlogic, a proposition may be true \\((p\\) holds), false \\((\\neg p\\)\nholds), or have a third truth value \\((p'\\) holds). Clearly, \\(p\n\\rightarrow \\neg p'\\) and \\(\\neg p \\rightarrow \\neg p'\\), and\ntherefore \\((\\neg p \\vee p) \\rightarrow \\neg p'\\); but then, by the\nthird of the lemmata above and axiom \\ref{GlivAxiom8} in the list,\n\\(\\neg p'\\). As \\(p\\) is arbitrary, this means no\nproposition has the third truth value. (In 1932, G\u00f6del would show\nthat, more generally, intuitionistic propositional logic is no \\(n\\)-valued\nlogic for any natural number \\(n\\);\nsee Section 1 of the supplementary document\n The Turn to Heyting\u2019s Formalized Logic and Arithmetic.)\n\nLike Kolmogorov in 1925 and, as we will see, Heyting in 1930, Glivenko\nprovided no detailed explanation of the intuitionistic validity of\nthese axioms.\n\nGlivenko immediately continued this line of work with a second short\npaper, Glivenko 1929, in which he showed, for a richer system of\nintuitionistic propositional logic:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is provable in classical propositional\nlogic, then \\(\\neg \\neg p\\) is provable in intuitionistic\npropositional logic;\nIf \\(\\neg p\\) is provable in classical propositional logic, then\nit is also provable in intuitionistic propositional logic.\n\n\nThe first theorem is not a translation in the usual sense (as\nKolmogorov\u2019s is), as it does not translate subformulas of \\(p\\);\nbut it is strong enough to show that the classical\nand intuitionistic systems in question are equiconsistent.\n\nThe system of intuitionistic propositional logic is richer than in\nGlivenko\u2019s previous paper, because to its axioms have now been\nadded the following four: \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\tag{A} (p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow r)) & \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow r))\\\\ \\tag{B} (p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow r)) & \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r)\\\\ \\tag{C} p & \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p)\\\\ \\tag{D} \\neg q & \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p)\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nInterestingly, Glivenko mentions in his paper that \u201cIt is Mr. A.\nHeyting who first made me see the appropriateness of the two axioms C\nand D in the Brouwerian logic\u201d (Mancosu 1998: 304\u2013305n.3).\nThe two had come into correspondence when, upon the publication of\nGlivenko 1928, Heyting sent Glivenko a letter (Troelstra 1990: 11).\nKolmogorov in 1925 had explicitly rejected Ex Falso for\nhaving no \u201cintuitive foundation\u201d. From Glivenko\u2019s\nletter to Heyting of October 13, 1928, we know that Glivenko was aware\nof this (Troelstra 1990: 12). In his paper, however, which he finished\nlater, he does not mention Kolmogorov at all. Instead, he makes the\nremark on Heyting just quoted and then justifies D by saying that it\nis a consequence of the principle \\((p \\vee \\neg q) \\rightarrow (q\n\\rightarrow p)\\), the admissibility of which he considers \u201cquite\n evident\u201d.[23]\n From a Brouwerian point of view, however, the principle is as\nobjectionable as Ex\n Falso.[24]\n It is worth noting that, when Heyting gave his justification for\nEx Falso in Heyting 1956: 102, he did not appeal to the\nprinciple Glivenko had used (nor did Kolmogorov in 1932). From\nGlivenko\u2019s letter of October 18, 1928, one gets the impression\nthat this principle had not been the argument Heyting had actually\ngiven to convince him:\n\n\nI am now convinced by your reasons that intuitionistic mathematics\nneed not reject that axiom, so that all considerations against that\naxiom might lead beyond the limits of our present subject matter.\n(Troelstra 1990: 12; translation mine)\n\n\nHeyting had informed Glivenko of the planned publication of his\n(revised and translated) prize essay from 1928 in the\nMathematische Annalen. On October 30, 1928, Glivenko asked\nHeyting if he also was going to include the result that if \\(p\\)\nis provable in classical propositional logic, then\n\\(\\neg\\neg p\\) is provable in intuitionistic propositional logic; for\nif he would, then there would be no point for Glivenko in publishing\nhis own manuscript. Two weeks later, Glivenko had changed his mind,\nwriting to Heyting on November 13 that, even though this result\n\u201cis but an almost trivial remark\u201d, \u201cits rigorous\ndemonstration is a bit long\u201d and he wants to publish it\nindependently of Heyting\u2019s paper. Indeed, Glivenko\u2019s paper\nwas published first, and in it the publication of Heyting\u2019s\nformalization was announced; and when Heyting published his paper in\n1930, he included a reference to Glivenko 1929, stating its two\ntheorems, and he also acknowledged the use of results from Glivenko\n1928. Heyting\u2019s note \u201cOn intuitionistic logic\u201d, also\nfrom 1930, begins with a reference to Glivenko\u2019s \u201ctwo\nexcellent articles\u201d from 1928 and 1929.\n4.4 Heyting 1930\n\nHeyting\u2019s (partial) formalization of intuitionistic logic and\nmathematics in Heyting 1930, Heyting 1930A, and Heyting 1930B, is\nperhaps, as far as the parts on logic are concerned, the most\ninfluential intuitionistic publication ever, together with his book\nIntuitionism: An Introduction from 1956.\n\nHeyting\u2019s formalization comprised intuitionistic propositional\nand predicate logic, arithmetic, and analysis, all together in one big\nsystem (with only variables for arbitrary objects). The part concerned\nwith analysis was, not only in its intended interpretation (involving\nchoice sequences) but also formally, no subsystem of its classical\ncounterpart; this explains why it sparked no general interest at the\ntime. (A consequence we noted above is that Brouwer\u2019s strong\ncounterexamples never affected the debate.) Therefore this part of\nHeyting\u2019s formalization was left out of consideration by the\nother participants in the Foundational\n Debate.[25]\n This was different for the parts concerned with logic and arithmetic.\nFormally speaking and disregarding their intended interpretations,\nfrom these one could distill subsystems of their classical\ncounterparts, from which only PEM (or double negation elimination) is\nmissing. No doubt this encouraged many to accord to these systems a\ndefinitive character, which, as Heyting had remarked at the beginning\nof his paper, on the intuitionistic conception of logic they cannot\nhave:\n\n\nIntuitionistic mathematics is a mental activity\n[\u201cDenkt\u00e4tigkeit\u201d], and for it every\nlanguage, including the formalistic one, is only a tool for\ncommunication. It is in principle impossible to set up a system of\nformulas that would be equivalent to intuitionistic mathematics, for\nthe possibilities of thought cannot be reduced to a finite number of\nrules set up in advance. Because of this, the attempt to reproduce the\nmost important parts of formal language is justified exclusively by\nthe greater conciseness and determinateness of the latter\nvis-\u00e0-vis ordinary language; and these are properties that\nfacilitate the penetration into the intuitionistic concepts and the\nuse of these concepts in research. (Heyting 1930: 42 [Mancosu 1998:\n311])\n\n\nHowever, Heyting himself, however, wrote some five decades later,\n\n\nI regret that my name is known to-day mainly in connection with these\npapers [Heyting 1930, 1930A, 1930B], which were very imperfect and\ncontained many mistakes. They were of little help in the struggle to\nwhich I devoted my life, namely a better understanding and\nappreciation of Brouwer\u2019s ideas. They diverted the attention\nfrom the underlying ideas to the formal system itself. (Heyting 1978:\n15)\n\n\nThe fear that the attention might be thus diverted had indeed been\nexpressed in the first of the three papers themselves:\n\n\nSection 4 [on negation] departs substantially from classical logic.\nHere I could not avoid giving the impression that the differences that\ncome to the fore in this section constitute the most important point\nof conflict between intuitionists and formalists (a claim that is\nalready refuted by the remark made at the beginning [quoted above]);\nthis impression arises because the formalism is unfit to express the\nmore fundamental points of conflict. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998:\n313])\n\n\nFor the full system, including predicate logic and analysis, the\nreader is referred to Heyting\u2019s original papers. Heyting\u2019s\naxioms for intuitionistic propositional logic were: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \n \\tag{1} a &\\rightarrow(a \\wedge a)\\\\\n \\tag{2} (a \\wedge b) &\\rightarrow(b \\wedge a)\\\\\n \\tag{3} (a \\rightarrow b) &\\rightarrow((a \\wedge c)\\rightarrow(b \\wedge c))\\\\\n \\tag{4} ((a \\rightarrow b) \\wedge(b \\rightarrow c)) &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow c)\\\\\n \\tag{5} \\label{HeytingAxiom5} b &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\\\\n \\tag{6} (a \\wedge(a \\rightarrow b)) &\\rightarrow b\\\\\n \\tag{7} a &\\rightarrow(a \\vee b)\\\\\n \\tag{8} (a \\vee b) &\\rightarrow(b \\vee a)\\\\\n \\tag{9} ((a \\rightarrow c) \\wedge(b \\rightarrow c)) &\\rightarrow((a \\vee b) \\rightarrow c)\\\\\n \\tag{10} \\label{HeytingAxiom10} \\neg a &\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\\\\n \\tag{11} ((a \\rightarrow b) \\wedge(a \\rightarrow \\neg b)) &\\rightarrow \\neg a\\\\\n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nIn a letter to Oskar Becker, Heyting described the approach used to\nobtain these axioms, as well as those for predicate logic, as\nfollows:\n\n\nI sifted the axioms and theorems of Principia Mathematica\nand, on the basis of those that were found to be admissible, looked\nfor a system of independent axioms. Given the relative completeness of\nPrincipia, this to my mind ensures the completeness of my system in\nthe best possible way. Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is\nimpossible to be certain that one has captured all admissible\nmodes of inference in one formal system. (Heyting to Becker, September\n23, 1933 (draft) [van Atten 2005: 129], original italics, translation\nmine)\n\n\nAs Heyting emphasizes here, the theorems of Principia\nMathematica also had to be looked at, for a theorem might be\nintuitionistically acceptable even when a classical proof given for it\nis\n not.[26]\n It is worth noting that Heyting used this method of crossing out, as\nalso Kolmogorov had, instead of determining the logic directly from\ngeneral considerations on mathematical constructions in\nBrouwer\u2019s sense. (To some extent, Kreisel tried to do that\nsystematically in the 1960s.) \nIn his dissertation on intuitionistic\naxiomatization of projective geometry, Heyting had already gained\nexperience with developing an intuitionistic system by taking a\nclassical axiomatic system as guideline and then adjusting\n it.[27]\n\nIn Mints 2006 (section 2) it has been observed that Russell 1903\n(section 18) anticipated intuitionistic propositional logic by\nidentifying Peirce\u2019s law and using it to separate out the\nprinciples that imply PEM. It seems that Heyting did not realize this\nat the time; among the references given in Heyting 1930,\nRussell\u2019s book does not appear.\n\nHeyting shows the independence of his axioms using a method given by\nBernays (1926); this use of a non-intended interpretation for\nmetamathematical purposes Heyting accepted without hesitation, but he\nremarked that such metamathematics is \u201cless important for us\n[intuitionists]\u201d than the approach where all formulas are\nconsidered to be meaningful propositions (Heyting 1930: 43 [Mancosu\n1998: 312]).\n\nHeyting states Glivenko\u2019s two theorems from 1929, without giving\nproofs.\n\nUnlike Kolmogorov, but like Glivenko (who had been convinced by\nHeyting), Heyting accepted Ex Falso (axiom\n\\ref{HeytingAxiom10} above). He was somewhat more elaborate on this\npoint than they had been:\n\n\nThe formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) generally means: \u201cIf \\(a\\)\nis correct, then \\(b\\) is correct\ntoo\u201d. This proposition is meaningful if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are constant propositions about whose correctness\nnothing need be known \u2026 The case if conceivable that after the\nstatement \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved in the sense specified,\nit turns out that \\(b\\) is always correct. Once\naccepted, the formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) then has to remain correct;\nthat is, we must attribute a meaning to the sign \\(\\rightarrow\\) such\nthat \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) still holds. The same can be remarked in the\ncase where it later turns out that \\(a\\) is always\nfalse. For these reasons, the formulas [\\ref{HeytingAxiom5}] and\n[\\ref{HeytingAxiom10}] are accepted. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998:\n313])\n\n\nThe argument is, however, incomplete. It is uncontroversial that, once\n\\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved, it should remain so when\nafterward \\(\\neg a\\) is proved. But why should \\(a \\rightarrow b\\), if\nit has not yet been proved, become provable just by establishing\n\\(\\neg a\\)? (Johansson asked this in a letter to Heyting in\n 1935;[28]\n see Section 1 of the supplementary document\n Objections to the Proof Interpretation). Clearly, then, further work needed to be done on the\nexplanation of intuitionistic logic.\n\nAfter the publication of Heyting\u2019s series of papers, three roads\ncould be taken, and indeed were (cf. Posy 1992):\n\nto explicate and develop the meaning explanation that had given\nrise to Heyting\u2019s system;\nto engage in metamathematical study of the formal systems\ndistilled from Heyting\u2019s system;\nto find alternative motivations for (parts of) Heyting\u2019s\nsystem that are independent from the intuitionists\u2019, yet also in\nsome sense constructive (e.g., Lorenzen\u2019s dialogue\nsemantics)\n\n\nBy and large, these three roads lead to very different areas, with\ncorrespondingly divergent histories, of which no unified account can\nbe expected. (However, in the Dialectica Interpretation, as proposed\nand understood by G\u00f6del [1958, 1970, 1972], they came close to\none another.) \nFollowing the main theme of the present account, our topic\nwill remain the intuitionistic meaning explanation of logic. But a\nnumber of early highlights of the formal turn are presented in this\nsupplementary document:\n\nThe Turn to Heyting\u2019s Formalized Logic and Arithmetic\n\n5. The Proof Interpretation Made Explicit\n5.1 Heyting 1930, 1931\n\nHeyting told van Dalen that he had the notion of (intuitionistic)\nconstruction in mind to guide him in devising his formalization of\nintuitionistic logic and mathematics in 1927. In the published version\nof his formalization, he did not elaborate much on the meaning of the\nconnectives; all he explained there about the general meaning of \\(a\n\\rightarrow b\\) was that \u201cIf \\(a\\) is correct,\nthen \\(b\\) is correct too\u201d (Heyting 1930: 44\n[Mancosu 1998: 313]). Correspondence between Heyting and Freudenthal\nin 1930 shows that Heyting up till then did not have a more refined\nexplanation at hand; we will come back to this later in this\nsection.\n\nHeyting began to expound on the meaning of the connectives in print in\ntwo papers written in 1930. The first, Heyting 1930C, was published\nthat same year, the second, the text of his lecture at K\u00f6nigsberg\nin September 1930, was published the next year (Heyting 1931).\n\nThe first paper was a reaction to Barzin and Errera\u2019s claim that\nBrouwer\u2019s logic is three-valued (Barzin & Errera 1927). The\nrelevant points for the explanation of the meaning of the connectives\nin Heyting\u2019s paper are the following. First, an explanation is\ngiven of assertion:\n\n\nHere, then, is the Brouwerian assertion of \\(p\\):\nIt is known how to prove p. We will denote\nthis by \\(\\vdash p\\). The words \u201cto prove\u201d must be taken\nin the sense of \u201cto prove by construction\u201d. [original\nitalics] (Heyting 1930C: 959 [Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nAnd then of intuitionistic negation:\n\n\n\\(\\vdash \\neg p\\) will mean: \u201cIt is known how to reduce \\(p\\)\nto a contradiction\u201d. (Heyting 1930C: 960\n[Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nHeyting goes on to explain that, although on these explanations there\nis a third case beside \\(\\vdash p\\) and \\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), namely the\ncase where one knows neither how to prove \\(p\\) nor how\nto refute it, this does not mean there is a third truth value:\n\n\nThis case could be denoted by \\(p'\\), but it must be realized that\n\\(p'\\) will hardly ever be a definitive statement, since it is\nnecessary to take into account the possibility that the proof of\neither \\(p\\) or \\(\\neg p\\) might one day succeed. If\none does not wish to risk having to retract what one has said, in the\ncase \\(p'\\) one should not state anything at all. (Heyting 1930C: 960\n[Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nThis refutes the contention of Barzin and Errera. Note that these\npoints are all in Brouwer\u2019s writings, too. Indeed, Heyting\n(1932: 121) objects to Barzin and Errera\u2019s term\n\u201cHeyting\u2019s logic\u201d, saying that \u201call the\nfundamental ideas of that logic come from Brouwer\u201d (translation\nmine). But Heyting\u2019s papers will have found a wider audience\nthan Brouwer\u2019s. Brouwer, in turn, was very positive about the\npaper Heyting 1930C, and wrote to the editor of the journal in which\nit appeared (Brouwer to de Donder, October 9, 1930):\n\n\nWhile preparing a note on intuitionism for the Bulletin de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale de\n Belgique,[29]\n I was pleasantly surprised to see the publication of a note by my\nstudent Mr. Heyting, which elucidates in a magisterial manner the\npoints that I wanted to shed light upon myself. I believe that after\nHeyting\u2019s note little remains to be said. (van Dalen 2005:\n676)\n\n\nHeyting also proposes a provability operator +, where \\(+p\\) means\n\u201c\\(p\\) is provable\u201d. The distinction\nbetween \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\) is relevant if one believes\nthat (at least some) propositions are true or false independently of\nour mathematical activity. In that case one can go on and develop a\nprovability logic, as for example G\u00f6del did (see\n Section 1 of the supplementary document\n The Turn to Heyting\u2019s Formalized Logic and Arithmetic.) That is not the intuitionistic conception, and Heyting\nremarks that, if the fulfillment of \\(p\\) requires a\nconstruction, then there is no difference between \\(p\\)\nand \\(+p\\). He adds that, on the intuitionistic explanation of\nnegation, there is indeed no difference between \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(+\\neg\np\\), as a proof of \\(\\neg p\\) is defined as a construction that\nreduces \\(p\\) to a contradiction. But Heyting does not\ngeneralize this remark to all of intuitionistic logic. The final\nsection of the paper is a further discussion of the logic of the\nprovability operator, in particular its interaction with negation\n(e.g., \\(\\vdash \\neg +p\\) is the assertion that \\(p\\)\nis unprovable). But Heyting ends by saying that, as the\nintuitionists\u2019 task is the reconstruction of all mathematics,\nwhile at the same time no examples of propositions have been found so\nfar for which this provability operator would be necessary to express\ntheir status (e.g., to express absolute undecidability), it cannot be\nasked of intuitionists that they develop this logic (Heyting 1930C:\n963 [Mancosu 1998: 309\u2013310])\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg lecture, given in 1930 and published in 1931,\nspecifies the meanings of \\(p, \\neg p\\), and \\(p \\vee q\\). This time\nHeyting makes an explicit connection to phenomenology:\n\n\nWe here distinguish between propositions [Aussagen] and\nassertions [S\u00e4tze]. An assertion is the affirmation of a\nproposition. A mathematical proposition expresses a certain\nexpectation. For example, the proposition, \u201cEuler\u2019s\nconstant \\(C\\) is rational\u201d, expresses the\nexpectation that we could find two integers \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) such that \\(C = a / b\\). Perhaps the word\n\u201cintention\u201d, coined by the phenomenologists, expresses\neven better what is meant here \u2026 The affirmation of a\nproposition means the fulfillment of an intention. (Heyting 1931: 113\n[Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 58\u201359])\n\n\nCompared to the earlier paper written in 1930, the point about the\nprovability operator is amplified:\n\n\nThe distinction between \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\) vanishes as\nsoon a construction is intended in \\(p\\) itself, for\nthe possibility of a construction can be proved only by its actual\nexecution. If we limit ourselves to those propositions which require a\nconstruction, the logical function of provability does not arise at\nall. We can impose this restriction by treating only propositions of\nthe form \u201c\\(p\\) is provable\u201d, or, to put it\nanother way, by regarding every intention as having the intention of a\nconstruction for its fulfillment added to it. It is in this sense that\nintuitionistic logic, insofar as it has been developed up to now\nwithout using the function +, must be understood. (Heyting 1931: 115\n[Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 60; translation modified])\n\n\nThe explanation of disjunction in the K\u00f6nigsberg lecture is:\n\n\n\u201c\\(p \\vee q\\)\u201d signifies that intention which is fulfilled\nif and only if at least one of the intentions \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\) is fulfilled. (Heyting 1931: 114 [Benacerraf\n& Putnam 1983: 59])\n\n\nAnd of negation:\n\n\nBecker, following Husserl, has described its meaning very clearly. For\nhim negation is something thoroughly positive, viz., the intention of\na contradiction contained in the original intention. The proposition\n\u201c\\(C\\) is not rational\u201d, therefore,\nsignifies the expectation that one can derive a contradiction from the\nassumption [Annahme] that \\(C\\) is rational.\nIt is important to note that the negation of a proposition always\nrefers to a proof procedure which leads to the contradiction, even if\nthe original proposition mentions no proof procedure. (Heyting 1931:\n113 [Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 59])\n\n\nHeyting pointed out that these explanations for disjunction and\nnegation, taken together, are an immediate argument against the\nacceptability of PEM, for which a general method would be needed that,\napplied to any given proposition \\(p\\), produces either\na proof of \\(p\\) or a proof of \\(\\neg p\\). What Heyting\ndid not do here was to generalize this explanation of negation to one\nfor implication. Also, note that the procedure does not operate on\nproofs of \\(p\\), but starts from merely the assumption\nthat \\(p\\), which in general gives less information.\nBoth points were taken care of shortly afterward. In a letter to\nFreudenthal dated October 25, 1930, shortly after the K\u00f6nigsberg\nlecture, Heyting wrote:\n\n\nFrom your remarks it has become clear to me that the simple\nexplanation of \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) by \u201cWhen I think \\(a\\),\nI must think \\(b\\)\u201d is\nuntenable; this idea is in any case too indeterminate to be able to\nserve as the foundation for a logic. But also your formulation:\n\u201cWhen \\(a\\) has been proved, so has \\(b\\)\u201d,\nis not wholly satisfactory to me; when I ask\nmyself what you may mean by that, I believe that also \\(a \\rightarrow\nb\\), like the negation, should refer to a proof procedure: \u201cI\npossess a construction that derives from every proof of \\(a\\)\na proof of \\(b\\)\u201d. In the\nfollowing, I will keep to this interpretation. There is therefore no\ndifference between \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) and \\(+a \\rightarrow +b\\).\n(Troelstra 1983: 206\u2013207; translation mine)\n\n\nThis explanation of implication, which is the one that became\nstandard, would be introduced in print only in Heyting 1934: 14; in\nhis paper 1932C, Heyting used the explanation given in Kolmogorov 1932\ninstead (see below).\n\nNeither of these two papers by Heyting contained an argument for the\nvalidity of Ex Falso.\n5.2 Influences on Heyting\n\nA number of influences (or possible influences) on Heyting\u2019s\narriving at the Proof Interpretation can be suggested. The following\nare publications Heyting had all seen by 1927, for he refers to them\nin his dissertation (1925: 93\u201394):\n\nBrouwer 1907 (Ch. 3) and Brouwer 1908C, which forcefully made the\npoint that intuitionistic logic is concerned with the preservation of\nconstructibility. (See\n section 2.1\n above.)\nBrouwer\u2019s proof of the bar theorem from 1924, handed in on\nMarch 29, 1924 (Brouwer 1924D1: 189 [Mancosu 1998: 36]), and perhaps\nalso the later version from 1927, of which the manuscript was handed\nin on April 28, 1926 (Brouwer 1927B: 75 [van Heijenoort 1967: 446]);\nboth show how to operate mathematically on demonstrations as objects.\n(See section\n 3.1.2\n above.)\nWeyl 1921, where universal and existential theorems are considered\nto be not genuine judgements at all, but\n\u201cUrteilsanweisungen\u201d (judgement instructions) and\n\u201cUrteilsabstrakte\u201d (judgement abstracts), thus\nemphasizing that such theorems for their justification need to be\nbacked up by a construction method. Brouwer, in a note on Weyl\u2019s\npaper, agreed, saying \u201cThis is only a matter of name and\ncertainly does not reflect any lacking insight on my part\u201d\n(Mancosu 1998: 122).\n\n\nA further likely influence is Brouwer\u2019s unpublished elucidation\nof the virtual ordering axioms (see\n section 3.1.3\n above). Dirk van Dalen (personal communication) suspects that,\nalthough Heyting was probably not present at this lecture course, he\nheard Brouwer make a similar comment on another occasion (for example\nduring the years 1922\u20131925, when Heyting was working on his\ndissertation under Brouwer, for that work also considers\nintuitionistic orderings).\n5.3 Kolmogorov 1932 and Heyting 1934\n\nIn 1932, Kolmogorov presented a logic of problems and their solutions,\nand pointed out that the logic this explanation validates is formally\nequivalent to the intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic\npresented by Heyting in 1930. Moreover, he suggests that this provides\na better interpretation than Heyting\u2019s.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s idea is this:\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two problems,\nthen \\(a \\wedge b\\) designates the problem \u201cto solve both\nproblems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\u201d, while\n\\(a \\vee b\\) designates the problem \u201cto solve at least one of\nthe problems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\u201d.\nFurthermore, \\(a \\supset b\\) is the problem \u201cto solve \\(b\\)\nprovided that the solution for \\(a\\)\nis given\u201d or, equivalently, \u201cto reduce the solution of \\(b\\)\nto the solution of \\(a\\)\u201d\n\\(\\ldots \\neg a\\) designates the problem \u201cto obtain a\ncontradiction provided that the solution of \\(a\\) is\ngiven\u201d \\(\\ldots(x)a(x)\\) stands in general for the problem\n\u201cto give a general method for the solution of \\(a(x)\\) for every\nsingle value of \\(x\\)\u201d. (Kolmogorov 1932: 59\n[Mancosu 1998: 329])\n\n\nHe then lists Heyting\u2019s axioms for propositional logic (with\nHeyting\u2019s numbering) and, by discussing an example, makes it\nclear that these all hold when interpreted as statements about\nproblems and their solutions. He also points out that \\(a \\vee \\neg\na\\) is the problem\n\n\nto give a general method that allows, for every problem \\(a\\),\neither to find a solution for \\(a\\),\nor to infer a contradiction from the existence of a solution for \\(a\\)!\n\nIn particular, if the problem \\(a\\) consists in the\nproof of a proposition, then one must possess a general method either\nto prove or to reduce to a contradiction any proposition. (Kolmogorov\n1932: 63 [Mancosu 1998: 332]).\n\n\nIn the second part of his paper, Kolmogorov argues that, given the\nepistemological tenets of intuitionism,\n\n\nintuitionistic logic should be replaced by the calculus of problems,\nfor its objects are in reality not theoretical propositions but rather\nproblems. (Kolmogorov 1932: 58 [Mancosu 1998: 328])\n\n\nThat he considers his interpretation an alternative to\nHeyting\u2019s, and a preferable one, is again emphasized in a note\nadded in proof:\n\n\nThis interpretation of intuitionistic logic is closely connected with\nthe ideas Mr. Heyting has developed in the last volume of\nErkenntnis 2, 1931: 106 [Heyting 1931]; yet in Heyting a\nclear distinction between propositions and problems is missing.\n(Kolmogorov 1932: 65 [Mancosu 1998: 334])\n\n\nBut it is not at all clear that Heyting would want to make that\ndistinction. If the notion of proposition is understood in such a way\nthat a proposition is true or false independently of our knowledge of\nthis fact, then Heyting would readily agree with Kolmogorov that a\nproposition is different from a problem; but as soon as one adopts the\nview that propositions express intentions that are fulfilled (and the\nproposition made true) or disappointed (and the proposition made\nfalse) by our mathematical constructions, which is the view that\nHeyting actually held, then there would seem to be no essential\ndifference between propositions and problems. Kolmogorov himself had\nalready indicated that a problem may consist in finding the proof of a\nproposition; exploiting this, one can argue that the following two\nnotions of proposition coincide:\n\npropositions express intentions towards constructions\npropositions pose problems which are solved by carrying out\nconstructions\n\n\nThe basic idea is that a proposition in sense 1 gives rise to the\nproblem of finding a construction that fulfills the expressed\nintention, and that a solution to a problem posed in a proposition in\nsense 2 also serves to fulfill the intention towards constructions\nthat solve that problem; this is made fully explicit in a little\nargument due to Martin-L\u00f6f, given in detail in Sundholm 1983:\n158\u2013159.\n\nIn a letter to Heyting of October 12, 1931, Kolmogorov in effect\nagrees that the difference between Heyting and him is mainly a\nterminological matter (Troelstra 1990: 15).\n\nHeyting later claimed that Kolmogorov\u2019s meaning explanation and\nhis own amounted to the same (Heyting 1958C: 107). By 1937, Kolmogorov\nseems to have come to believe the same, as in a review in the\nZentralblatt of an exchange between Freudenthal and Heyting\n(discussed in Section 1 of the supplementary document\n Objections to the Proof Interpretation), he consistently speaks of \u201cintention or problem\u201d\n(Kolmogorov 1937). In that exchange itself, Freudenthal (1937: 114)\nhad said that between Heyting\u2019s and Kolmogorov\u2019s\nexplanations there was \u201cno essential difference\u201d. Finally,\nOskar Becker, in a letter to Heyting of September 1934, had remarked\nthat Heyting\u2019s interpretation is a generalization of\nKolmogorov\u2019s, as a \u201cproblem\u201d and its\n\u201csolution\u201d are special cases of an intention and its\nfulfillment. \u201cIntuitionistic logic is therefore a\n\u2018calculus of\n intentions\u2019\u201d.[30]\n\nHowever, a complication for the identification of Heyting\u2019s and\nKolmogorov\u2019s explanations of logic is introduced by\nKolmogorov\u2019s also accepting, in a particular case, solutions\nthat do not consist in a carrying out a concrete construction.\nKolmogorov said that \u201cAs soon as \\(\\neg a\\) is solved, then the\nsolution of \\(a\\) is impossible and the problem \\(a\n\\rightarrow b\\) is without content\u201d (Kolmogorov 1932: 62\n[Mancosu 1998: 331]), and proposed that \u201cThe proof that a\nproblem is without content [owing to an impossible assumption] will\nalways be considered as its solution\u201d (Kolmogorov 1932: 59:\n[Mancosu 1998: 329]). Taken together, this yields a justification of\nEx Falso, \\(\\neg a \\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\).\n\nIt seems not altogether unreasonable to extend the meaning of the term\n\u201csolution\u201d this way, for, just like a concrete solution,\nan impossibility proof also provides what might be called\n\u201cepistemic closure\u201d: like a concrete solution, it provides\na completely convincing reason to stop working on a certain problem.\n(This kind of \u201chigher-order\u201d solution is also familiar\nfrom Hilbert\u2019s Program, e.g., Hilbert 1900: 51.) Note that this\njustification of Ex Falso makes no attempt to describe a\ncounterfactual mathematical construction process; thus,\nKolmogorov\u2019s justification in 1932 is not really incompatible\nwith the ground for his rejection of Ex Falso in 1925,\nnamely, that one cannot constructively assert consequences of\nsomething impossible. Rather, the solution from 1932 introduces a\nstipulation to achieve completion of the logical theory for its own\nsake.\n\nOn the other hand, although Kolmogorov\u2019s stipulation is neither\nunreasonable nor unmotivated, on Brouwer\u2019s descriptive\nconception of logic there is of course no place for stipulation. For\nthis reason, \u201cProof Interpretation\u201d seems to be a more\nappropriate name for an explanation of Brouwerian logic than\n\u201cBHK Interpretation\u201d.\n\nOn Heyting\u2019s explanation, however, a justification of Ex\nFalso parallel to Kolmogorov\u2019s would seem to be impossible:\nwhile a problem may find a \u201chigher-order\u201d solution when it\nis shown that a solution is impossible, it makes no sense to say that\nan intention finds \u201chigher-order\u201d fulfillment when it is\nshown that it cannot be fulfilled. The notion of a solution seems to\npermit a reasonable extension that the notion of fulfillment does not.\nIn his book from 1934, Heyting explains Ex Falso in\nKolmogorov\u2019s terms, not his own. After stating the axiom \\(\\neg\na \\supset (a \\supset b)\\), he says:\n\n\nIt is appropriate to interpret the notion of \u201creducing\u201d in\nsuch a way, that the proof of the impossibility of solving \\(a\\)\nat the same time reduces the solution of any problem\nwhatsoever to that of \\(a\\). (Heyting 1934: 15;\ntranslation mine)\n\n\nClearly there is a difference between Kolmogorov\u2019s own\nexplanation and Heyting\u2019s explanation in Kolmogorov\u2019s\nterms. Where Heyting says that a proof of \\(\\neg a\\) establishes a\nreduction of the solution of any problem to that of \\(a\\),\nKolmogorov had said that it established that the\nproblem of reducing the solution of any problem to that of \\(a\\)\nhas become without content. One has the impression\nthat Heyting in his explanation of Ex Falso tries to\napproximate as closely as possible the explanation for ordinary\nimplications in terms of a concrete constructive connection between\nantecedent and consequent; this is even clearer in the explanation he\nwould give of Ex Falso in 1956 (see\n section 5.4\n below). (Note that neither Heyting nor Kolmogorov ever justified\nEx Falso by giving the traditional argument (based on the\ndisjunctive syllogism) also stated in Glivenko\u2019s paper from\n1929; see\n section 4.3\n above.)\n\nMore generally, the explanation of logic in Heyting 1934 is for the\nmost part given Kolmogorov style, and not Heyting\u2019s own in terms\nof intentions and their fulfillment. (The latter is only mentioned for\nits explanation of the implication (Heyting 1934: 14).) Perhaps the\nreason for this is that Heyting (1934: 14) agrees with Kolmogorov\n(1932: 58) that the interpretation in terms of problems and solutions\nprovides a useful interpretation Heyting\u2019s formal system also\nfor non-intuitionists (while for intuitionists they come to the same\nthing). In his short note 1932C, titled \u201cThe application of\nintuitionistic logic to the definition of completeness of a logical\ncalculus\u201d, Heyting uses Kolmogorov\u2019s interpretation\ninstead of his own. Given the subject matter, that is what one might\nexpect.\n5.4 Heyting 1956\n\nIn his influential book Intuitionism. An introduction from\n1956, Heyting explains the logical connectives as follows\n(97\u201398, 102):\n\n\u201cA mathematical proposition \\(p\\) always\ndemands a mathematical construction with certain given properties; it\ncan be asserted as soon as such a construction has been carried\nout\u201d.\n\u201c\\(p \\wedge q\\) can be asserted if and only if both \\(p\\)\nand \\(q\\) can be asserted\u201d.\n\u201c\\(p \\vee q\\) can be asserted if and only if at least one of\nthe propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can be\nasserted\u201d.\n\u201c\\(\\neg p\\) can be asserted if and only if we possess a\nconstruction which from the supposition that a construction \\(p\\)\nwere carried out, leads to a\ncontradiction\u201d.\n\u201cThe implication \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) can be asserted, if and\nonly if we possess a construction \\(r\\), which, joined\nto any construction proving \\(p\\) (supposing that the\nlatter be effected), would automatically effect a construction proving\n\\(q\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\(\\vdash(\\forall x)p(x)\\) means that \\(p(x)\\) is true for\nevery \\(x\\) in \\(Q\\) [over which \\(x\\)\nranges]; in other words, we possess a general method\nof construction which, if any element \\(a\\) of \\(Q\\)\nis chosen, yields by specialization the construction\n\\(p(a)\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\((\\exists x)p(x)\\) will be true if and only if an element\n\\(a\\) of \\(Q\\) for which \\(p(a)\\) is\ntrue has actually been constructed\u201d.\n\n\nNote that these explanations are not in terms of proof\nconditions, but of assertion conditions. This may make a\ndifference in particular for the explanation of implication, where,\ninstead of only the information under what condition something counts\nas a proof of \\(p\\), we now can also take into\nconsideration that, by hypothesis, a concrete construction for \\(p\\)\nhas been effected. As we saw in\n section 3.1.2,\n the possibility to do so is crucial for Brouwer\u2019s proof of the\nBar Theorem.\n\nIn the same pages, Heyting also gave the following justification of\nEx Falso:\n\n\nAxiom X [\\(\\neg p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow q)\\)] may not seem\nintuitively clear. As a matter of fact, it adds to the precision of\nthe definition of implication. You remember that \\(p \\rightarrow q\\)\ncan be asserted if and only if we possess a construction which, joined\nto the construction \\(p\\), would prove \\(q\\).\nNow suppose that \\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), that is, we have\ndeduced a contradiction from the supposition that \\(p\\)\nwere carried out. Then, in a sense, this can be considered as a\nconstruction, which, joined to a proof of \\(p\\) (which\ncannot exist) leads to a proof of \\(q\\). (Heyting 1956:\n102)\n\n\nOne easily recognizes Heyting\u2019s effort to explain Ex\nFalso as much as possible along the same lines as other\nimplications, namely, by providing a concrete construction that leads\nfrom the antecedent to the consequent. In its attempt to provide,\n\u201cin a sense\u201d, a construction, the explanation is clearly\nnot of the same kind as Kolmogorov\u2019s stipulation from 1932. But\nit does not fit into Heyting\u2019s original interpretation of logic\nin terms of intentions directed at constructions and the fulfillment\nof such intentions either. For to fulfill an intention directed toward\na particular construction we will have to exhibit that construction;\nwe will have to exhibit a construction that transforms any proof of\n\\(p\\) into one of \\(q\\). But how can a\nconstruction that from the assumption \\(p\\) arrives at\na contradiction, and therefore generally speaking not at \\(q\\),\nlead to \\(q\\)? It will not do to say\nthat such a construction exists \u201cin a sense\u201d. A\nconstruction that is a construction \u201cin a sense\u201d, which\nHeyting helps himself to here, is no construction.\n\nEven within the intuitionistic movement, not everyone agreed with\nHeyting\u2019s explanation of logic.
