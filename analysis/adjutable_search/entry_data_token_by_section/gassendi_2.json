    "main_text": "Refutations of Aristotelians and Descartes\n3. Refutations of Aristotelians and Descartes\n\n\nFor many commentators, Gassendi's empiricist theory of knowledge and\nobjections to Descartes's Meditations count as his paramount\nphilosophical contributions. In his core epistemology, he offers the\nfirst modern model of knowledge from the senses to be integrated with\na physiological account of perception. In his objections to Descartes,\nhe rejects the clarity and distinctness criterion, seeks to undermine\nthe reasoning behind the cogito, and assails the ontological\nargument. Each of these views represents a battle Gassendi has taken\nup against the Aristotelian tradition or the Cartesian stance; his\nthoroughgoing empiricism poses an alternative to both of these\ncompeting perspectives.\n\n\nOne cornerstone of Gassendi's anti-Aristotelianism is the suggestion\nthat there is nothing necessary about the way the world is.  God, he\nproposes, could have made the world work in any number of ways, and\nthe contingent history and character of Creation means that there is\nnothing immutable about the essence of a material thing. (That a\n\u2018substance\u2019, in either the Aristotelian or Cartesian\nsense, might have an immutable essence, is a different matter, and\ninsofar as Gassendi has such a notion (for example, with respect to\nspace, time, matter, and void) he agrees that such things feature\nunchangeable sine qua non characteristics.) Moreover,\nGassendi maintains, regardless of whether there are any essences and\nwhether they might be mutable, there are none to which we have any\nepistemic access. The sole originating source of our knowledge is the\ninformation the senses provide, such that what we know is closely\nlinked to what we can perceive. However, as Descartes notes, we can\nperceive only appearances. Gassendi draws from this point the very\nuncartesian lesson that appearances are all we can know about,\ntoo\u2014thereby ruling out knowledge of unperceivable essences. One\nline of this reasoning can be found in his discussion of classical\nskeptical tropes concerning the relativity of evidence from the senses\nto individual experience\u2014that honey tastes sweet to me, though\nbitter to you; and that fire seems hot to us, though not so to insects\nthat live near fire (O III (DM) 388b; R 535). Since different\npeople have distinct experiences, our knowledge of honey's taste or\nfire's heat differs from person to person and thus is not a reliable\nguide to invariable characteristics of, for example, the honey or\nfire. In cases like these we know a thing's qualities only as we\nrecord them on a subjective basis. Such sensory information, based on\nexperiences which vary intersubjectively, cannot yield judgments about\na thing's qualities which do not vary in that (or any other)\nway. Hence we lack knowledge of the thing's essence, if indeed there\nis one. More broadly, from our principal source of ideas\u2014the\nsenses\u2014we know only how things appear to us (O III (DM)\n311b-312a; R 184). (If we are to have knowledge of an object's\nessence, Gassendi proposes, such requires a \u201cperfect interior\nexamination\u201d of that object, which is apparently not something\nwe may gain from empirical study.)\n\n\nGassendi also contests the Aristotelian view that we can know\nuniversals, on the grounds that we cannot perceive anything more than\nparticulars in the world (O III (Exercitationes) 159a; EP\n280-281). It follows, he suggests, that neither can there be any\nuniversals we know about, at least with anything like certainty. Some\ncommentators (including Bloch, Rochot, and Osler) propose that\nnominalism is a central Gassendist view, on the basis of this\nrejection of essences and universals, as well as his epistemic\nreliance on the apparent, and interest in signs and their conventional\ncharacter. But Gassendi's nominalism\u2014if it be such, in the\northodox sense\u2014is intended less as an ontological assessment,\nthan as a statement of the limits of human mental capacity, whether\nepistemic or linguistic.\n\n\nFurther building on the insistence that all knowledge comes from the\nsenses, Gassendi discusses the view (shared as well by Descartes and\nthe Aristotelians) that there are propositions we can know with\ncertainty. Since all propositions are judged as true or false on an\nempirical basis, none can be deemed indubitable, save those of\ntheology and theologically-derived cosmology. This lack of certainty\nextends as well to logical demonstration, whether of inductive or\ndeductive character. Nothing is certain about such demonstration,\nGassendi suggests, save the limits imposed upon it by the frailty of\nhuman intellectual capacities. The natural bounds of our epistemic\ngrasp in the physical sciences, astronomy, or most any other field of\nstudy is just what the senses tell us, plus any correctives reason\nsupplies on the basis of sensory-based knowledge we have already\naccrued.\n\n\nThat Gassendi thinks there is a need for correctives on sensory\ninformation makes clear the depths of his rejection of epistemic\nfoundationalism in Aristotelian or Cartesian thought: we cannot trust\neven information from the senses to give us a failsafe picture of the\nworld. In this he embraces the Skeptical judgment that no source of\nbelief can provide for certain knowledge. Yet he cannot accept their\nwholesale dismissal of sensory-derived evidence for belief. Knowledge\nfrom the senses is possible just in case we have warrant for judgments\nabout appearances, though we may lack warrant for certainty about\nthose judgments. To the limited extent that we have the second sort of\nwarrant, he suggests, we find this in the reliability of our sensory\napparatuses (as he describes in his Epicurean-inspired account of\nperception). We see here a \u2018constructive skepticist\u2019\nresponse to the Skeptics who say no knowledge is possible and to those\nancient and latter-day \u2018dogmatic\u2019 thinkers (including, in\nhis view, the Aristotelians and Descartes) who say knowledge involves\nthe attainment of certain belief\u2014and is readily\nattainable. While it may not be possible to have certain beliefs, it\nis quite possible to have knowledge given that we construe it as\njustified but less-than-certain belief. (Naturally, it must have a\nveridical character as well, and Gassendi thinks it sufficient that\nsuch beliefs are at least truth-resembling.)\n\n\nGassendi articulates such disagreements with Descartes in the\nObjections, where he also rejects the Cartesian criterion of clarity\nand distinctness, as either a standard for judging ideas or source of\nepistemic warrant. As regards the former, Gassendi points out that\nreason, which comprises our intellectual judgments and interpretations\nof sensory information, is itself prone to error:\n\n\n\u2026although deception, or falsity, is not to be found in the\nsenses themselves, which merely behave passively and only report\nthings as they appear and as they must appear given their causes, it\nis to be found in the judgment, or mind, when it does not act with\nenough circumspection and does not perceive that things which are\ndistant\u2026appear more indistinct and smaller than they do close\nup\u2026.  (O III (DM) 388a; R 532; B 266-267)\n\n\n\n\nIf, for all their faults, claims based on sensory information are more\nreliable than those based on reasoning (about sensory information or\nanything else), then we ought not appeal to the latter as a basis for\njudging among claims of the former. One reason he thinks sensory-based\nclaims are the more reliable of the two is that he takes the senses to\npassively (hence steadily) collect information, in contrast to our\nmental judgment actively (hence irregularly) organizing or relating\ninformation. This is not to say that we will have no problems gauging\nthe warrant for claims based on sensory information as we collect\nit. Rather, we will have even more problems in gauging claims based on\nideas about sensory information after such ideas are that much more\nremoved from a direct and perspicuous relationship to the world as\nexperienced, in our organizing and relating them to other ideas.\n\n\nMoreover, the Cartesian criterion is irrelevant to judging cases of\nempirical knowledge, Gassendi suggests\u2014and even if this\ncriterion were not irrelevant, Descartes's own claims to knowledge\nshould fail all the same. First, in the case of empirical knowledge,\nGassendi proposes that the Cartesian criterion fails on classical\nSkeptical grounds: it is possible for us to have ideas from the senses\nwe take to be clear and distinct which are nevertheless not the basis\nfor warranted claims to empirical knowledge of a general\nnature. Though we may have clear and distinct ideas about the\nappearances of, for example, the color of the sky we perceive, we\ncannot infer from this clarity and distinctness that we know what\ncolor the sky is. As the Skeptics warn, the sky could appear to\ndifferent persons in different colors, and as Gassendi adds, our ideas\nof such an appearance could each be clear and distinct (O III\n(DM) 314b; R 198-199). Second, knowledge claims Descartes\ntakes to be demonstrated by reason alone Gassendi dismisses as anyway\nfailing the proposed criterion; they are partial and confused, he\nsuggests, because they lack the immediacy characteristic of judgments\nwe attain by strictly empirical means.  Whereas ideas we gain from the\nsenses directly represent worldly objects and events, ideas we attain\nby deductive proof are but hypothetical analogues to such\nsensory-derived ideas:\n\n\n\u2026it is not the same thing for us to conceive something by a\nveritable idea or a true image, and to conceive that thing by a\nconclusion that follows necessarily from an anterior hypothesis. In\nthe first case in effect we conceive of the thing as absolutely so; in\nthe second, that it should be some such thing; and also in the first\ncase we know the thing distinctly and as it is in itself, and in the\nsecond case we know it only in a confused manner and by analogy, that\nis, in referring to it as something that must be known by way of some\nidea (O III DM) 322b; R 234).\n\n\n\n\nIn brief, our reasoned claims are less than fully clear or distinct\nbecause we arrive at them through the mediation of ideas about our\nempirical knowledge. Hence Descartes's most cherished claims about\nessential properties of mind, God, and matter fail his own criterion\nfor lack of direct foundation in our ideas from the senses.\n\n\nNot all of Gassendi's criticisms of the Cartesian criterion are rooted\nin his advocacy of knowledge from the senses. Thus, he suggests, one\nother problem with that criterion is its failure to make good on its\nfoundationalist promise. Just in case some of our clear and distinct\nideas turn out to be wrong, we will require some further criterion to\ndistinguish them from the correct ideas. And if the new criterion is\nsimply something like \u2018more clear and more distinct\u2019, then\nwe are on the road to infinitely many higher-order criteria, which\ndefeats the aims of the foundationalist project altogether. Finally,\nGassendi offers what Descartes himself came to call \u201cthe\nobjection of objections.\u201d Our ideas being clear and distinct\nideas is perfectly consonant with a solipsistic perspective, but then\nthe only thing we can know with certainty is our own thoughts. Yet a\nviable criterion should (a) also distinguish our knowledge claims\nabout the external world, and (b) mark solipsistic claims as dubitable\nto begin with. On top of these objections, Gassendi proposes that\nDescartes has put the cart before the horse by suggesting we can\nreadily recognize what is clear and distinct and use this as a guide\nto what is indubitable when what we need in the first place is some\nguide as to what is clear and distinct:\n\n\n\u2026the difficulty is not, as it seems, to know if one must\nconceive things clearly and distinctly so as not to be mistaken at\nall, but to know by what way or method it is possible to recognize\nthat one has a conception so clear and so distinct that it is true and\nimpossible that we are mistaken. (O III (DM) 372b; R 458)\n\n\n\n\nAnother well-known set of Gassendi's objections target Descartes'\nviews of mind and body. One such objection is a prelude to the\nwell-known puzzle over how mind and body could be thought to interact,\nposed by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia. Gassendi wonders how Descartes\ncould take the mind to be thinking substance lacking extension yet\nclaim that it is somehow attached to the body, given that anything\njoined to a body must itself be extended (O III (DM)\n399b-401a; R 584-590). Descartes's answer is that he does not take\nmind and body to be attached, which response immediately invites\nPrincess Elisabeth's puzzle.\n\n\nIn a related vein, Descartes's cogito reasoning also\nundergoes close scrutiny. Gassendi understands this reasoning as one\nperson's inference from his or her indubitable recognition of\ncognitive activity, to the claim that he or she exists as the selfsame\nseat of such activity. Against such an inference he points out that\nrecognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is\na particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation\nthat there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking\nto a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to\nprove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the\ncapacity for thought (O III (DM) 289a-290a; R\n82-86). Descartes is in dangerous waters at this point, for if indeed\nthe only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim\nthat there is cognitive activity present, then he can be fairly\nassociated with Averroist panpsychism, and its considerable taint. At\na minimum, the argument requires a significant leap of reasoning, and\nfor Gassendi, this is further evidence that Descartes places\naltogether too much faith in his criterion and the work he thinks it\ncan do.\n\n\nThat Gassendi is primarily concerned here with the character of\nDescartes's reasoning is plain enough: in the end and broadly\nspeaking, the two are actually close in their views about mind and\nbody. They are both dualists of one stripe or another, and the\nparticulars of Gassendi's physically-rooted psychology are reasonably\nsimilar to those of Descartes's model.  Gassendi's model of the mind\nis often taken to be wholly materialist in design, particularly as\nseen through the prism of his critique of Descartes. Yet only one\nfacet of the Gassendist soul is the material anima, the locus of\nphysically-determined pleasure and pain.  He also posits an immaterial\nanimus, the seat of the intellect or rational understanding. This\ncognitive faculty is the locus of spiritually-determined pleasures and\npains we associate with, for example, love of God or fear of\nevil. Here we have an echo of the Thomist interpretation of De Anima,\naccording to which vegetative and motive facets of the soul perish\nwith the body though an intellective facet lives on forever.\n\n\nElsewhere on a theological plane, Gassendi shares other core views\nwith Descartes, though some commentators have tried to paint Gassendi\nas concealing atheist tendencies, owing to his suspected materialist\nand libertine allegiances. Such a charge is inaccurate.  Yet it is\nalso so that Gassendi does not accept the Cartesian route to belief in\nthe Divine, notably rejecting Descartes' version of the ontological\nargument.\n\n\nThe Cartesian version of Anselm's traditional argument suggests that\nGod has the intrinsic property of existence as part of a divine\nessence, in the same way a triangle has intrinsic properties such as\nhaving three internal angles summing to 180 degrees. Further, as with\nall divinely-held properties, God has that existence property as a\nperfection\u2014that is, God exists in a perfect way, such that God\ncannot not exist. Gassendi rejects this reasoning on two grounds.\nFirst, we have no irrefutable intuitions of essences, whether such are\nsupposed to be represented by properties of triangles or of God.\nDescartes' particular misstep here is to suggest that we may move from\nthe definition of God (which we intuit as a clear and distinct notion)\nas essentially entailing the property of existence, to the view that\nthere is such a thing as God with said property. A definition of a\nthing as having such and such properties does not commit us to the\nthing existing with those properties, even if one of those properties\nis said to be existence. This much was noted in Gaunilo's early\ncriticism of Anselm's version. Yet the more general point Gassendi\nmakes is that no intuitions untested by sensory experience will yield\nknowledge of God's essence or anything else, as the primary mode of\nattaining knowledge (and that by which any intuitions must be tested)\nis empirical demonstration. Second, presaging the Kantian criticism,\nexistence is neither a perfection nor any sort of property or\npredicate of things that exist. Rather, existence is simply an aspect\nof things that exist, the mode or state of being that describes its\nexisting. Existence is accordingly a precondition for bearing\nperfections (and for perfections being borne by the thing), rather\nthan something which itself can be a perfection. If we refer to a\nthing's existence, we are only referring to a fact about the thing,\nthat it exists. Rejecting the ontological argument, then, eliminates a\nsort of conceptual confusion: although we might think of perfections\nexisting (in a thing), it is hard to conceive of what it would mean\nfor existence to exist (in a thing), or for that matter, to not\nexist. Along similar lines, there is no reason to accept the\nunderlying claim of the ontological argument that things which do not\nexist are either imperfect or lacking in any way (O III (DM)\n379b-380b; R 490-6).\n",
