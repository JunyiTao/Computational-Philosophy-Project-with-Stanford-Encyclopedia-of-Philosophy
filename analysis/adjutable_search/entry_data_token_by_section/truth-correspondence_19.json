    "main_text": "More Objections to the Correspondence Theory || The Big Fact\n9.1 The Big Fact\n\n\nInspired by an allegedly similar argument of Frege\u2019s, Davidson\n(1969) argues that the correspondence theory is bankrupt because it\ncannot avoid the consequence that all true sentences correspond to the\nsame fact: the Big Fact. The argument is based on two crucial\nassumptions: (i) Logically equivalent sentences can be\nsubstituted salva veritate in the context \u2018the fact\nthat...\u2019; and (ii) If two singular terms denoting the same thing\ncan be substituted for each other in a given sentence salva\nveritate, they can still be so substituted if that sentence is\nembedded within the context \u2018the fact that...\u2019. In the\nversion below, the relevant singular terms will be the following:\n\u2018(the x such that x = Diogenes\n& p)\u2019 and \u2018(the x such\nthat x = Diogenes & q)\u2019. Now, assume that\na given sentence, s, corresponds to the fact that p;\nand assume that \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019\nare sentences with the same truth-value. We have:\n\ns corresponds to the fact that\np\n\n\n which, by (i), implies\n\ns corresponds to the fact that [(the x such that\nx = Diogenes & p) = (the x such that\nx = Diogenes)],\n\n which, by (ii), implies\n\ns corresponds to the fact that [(the x such that\nx = Diogenes & q) = (the x such that\nx = Diogenes)], \n\n\n which, by (i), implies\n\ns corresponds to the fact that q.\n\n\n\nSince the only restriction on \u2018q\u2019 was that it\nhave the same truth-value as \u2018p\u2019, it would follow\nthat any sentence s that corresponds to any fact corresponds\nto every fact; so that all true sentences correspond to the same\nfacts, thereby proving the emptiness of the correspondence\ntheory\u2014the conclusion of the argument is taken as tantamount to\nthe conclusion that every true sentence corresponds to the totality of\nall the facts, i.e, the Big Fact, i.e., the world as a whole.\n\n\nThis argument belongs to a type now called \u201cslingshot\narguments\u201d (because a giant opponent is brought down by a single\nsmall weapon, allegedly). The first versions of this type of argument\nwere given by Church (1943) and G\u00f6del (1944); it was later\nadapted by Quine (1953, 1960) in his crusade against quantified modal\nlogic. Davidson is offering yet another adaption, this time involving\nthe expression \u201ccorresponds to the fact that\u201d. The\nargument has been criticized repeatedly. Critics point to the two\nquestionable assumptions on which it relies, (i) and (ii). It is far\nfrom obvious why a correspondence theorist should be tempted by either\none of them. Opposition to assumption (i) rests on the view that\nexpressibility by logically equivalent sentences may be a necessary,\nbut is not a sufficient condition for fact identity. Opposition to\nassumption (ii) rests on the observation that the (alleged) singular\nterms used in the argument are definite descriptions: their\nstatus as genuine singular terms is in doubt, and it is well-known\nthat they behave rather differently than proper names for which\nassumption (ii) is probably valid (cf. Follesdal 1966/2004; Olson\n1987; K\u00fcnne 2003; and especially the extended discussion and\ncriticism in Neale 2001.)\n",
