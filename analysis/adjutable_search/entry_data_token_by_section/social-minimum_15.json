    "main_text": "What can be said against the enactment of a social minimum? || The legitimacy objection\n4. Conclusion\n\nInstead of summarizing the arguments of the previous sections here, we\nclose by noting three further points which put our discussion into\nperspective.\n\nFirstly, we should note that as we move to enact the social minimum\nthere are a number of important policy design questions that arise\nthat our discussion thus far leaves unresolved. We have considered one\ndesign issue: the issue of how far access to the social minimum should\nbe work-conditional. But there is a huge range of other design issues\nthat we have not directly considered. For example, if we accept that\nthe government has a responsibility to its citizens to secure access\nto certain basic goods and services, to what extent should the\ngovernment itself directly produce these goods and services, e.g.,\nhealth-care? If we accept that the government must introduce\ntax-transfer schemes to enact the social minimum, what form should\nthese take? Should the government use \u201cmeans-testing\u201d to\ntarget transfers exclusively to the most needy, or should it seek to\nenact the social minimum through so-called \u201csocial\ninsurance\u201d programs to which all (or virtually all) citizens\ncontribute, and from which all receive\n benefits?[10]\n If the government provides citizens with assistance in meeting a\nspecific need, should it provide assistance in the form of\n\u201cin-kind\u201d benefits or in the form of\n cash?[11]\n These are all major design questions that arise in thinking about how\nto enact the social minimum. One cannot settle them merely by appeal\nto the basic idea of the social minimum. Although many of the ideas\nand considerations discussed here will be relevant in addressing these\nquestions, settling them requires further philosophical reflection\nand, indeed, a lot of empirical research.\n\nSecondly, it is important to emphasise again that much of our\ndiscussion has taken the scope of the social minimum to be that of a\nnation state, but we can and should also consider obligations to enact\na social minimum at transnational and global levels. A full discussion\nof this would need to draw on the growing body of literature on global\n justice.[12]\n\nThirdly, even when considering economic and social arrangements within\na given nation, we need to keep distinct the specific question of\nwhether and why a social minimum is justified from the broader\nquestion of what social justice consists in and demands of us.\nEnacting a social minimum may well be a demand of social justice.\nIndeed, it may well be one of the most urgent demands of social\njustice. But, challenging as this demand is, social justice might\nrequire much more of us than this.\n",
