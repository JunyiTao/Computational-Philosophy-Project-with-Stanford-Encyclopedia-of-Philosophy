    "main_text": "Life, works, and influence || The Brahmanical tradition of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\n1.2 The Brahmanical tradition of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\n\n\nIt is sometimes surmised from his evident knowledge of Dravidian\nlanguages (his Tantrav\u0101rttika includes some discussion of\nTamil word forms) that Kum\u0101rila may have been south Indian; as\nis typically the case for the figures of classical Indian philosophy, though,\nhe is really known to us only in the stylized terms of traditional\nhagiographies. What is certain is that Kum\u0101rila was one of the two\nmost significant commentators on the foundational texts of the\ntradition of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101; indeed, this\northodox Brahmanical tradition of thought divides chiefly along two\nlines of seventh- and eighth-century commentary, with those\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas who take their bearings from Kum\u0101rila\nhaving been styled Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das (\u201cfollowers of\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u201d), while those who defer instead to\nPrabh\u0101kara\u2014who flourished around 700, and who is sometimes\nsaid to have been Kum\u0101rila\u2019s student\u2014are\ncomparably called \u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101karas.\u201d\n\n\nInsofar as this central divergence between Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara involves reference to a shared foundation of texts, it\nis important to appreciate the traditional Brahmanical context for\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s thought. \u201cM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u201d literally means something like \u201cinvestigation\u201d or \u201cinquiry,\u201d but here refers particularly to hermeneutical inquiry. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s tradition of\nP\u016brva (\u201cprior\u201d) M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nthen, is typically so denominated in contrast to\n\u201cUttara,\u201d or \u201csubsequent,\u201d\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. \n\nBoth strands of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 have as their guiding concern the\ninterpretation and right application of Vedic texts, which these two\nschools agree in thinking to be uniquely authoritative for matters of\nultimate concern. These schools differ chiefly over which portion of\nthis vast corpus of texts should be thought definitive; for\n\u201cVeda\u201d\u2014a scriptural category that is arguably\ndefinitive of \u201cHinduism\u201d\u2014represents a status\ntraditionally claimed for a huge range of texts, composed over a large\nperiod of time (from c. 1200 bce to early in the first millennium\nand even later), and comprising a wide spectrum of literary genres and\ncharacteristic doctrines. Advocacy of the \u201cP\u016brva\u201d\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 position is defined by commitment to the\nauthority particularly of the earlier portion of the Vedic corpus\n(culminating with texts called Br\u0101hma\u1e47as), which\nchiefly concerns the performance of ritual sacrifice; hence, the school\nof thought advanced by Kum\u0101rila was also well known as Karma\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201chermeneutics of ritual action\u201d) or Adhvara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201chermeneutics of sacrifice\u201d). In contrast, Uttara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 takes its bearings from that portion\nof the Vedic corpus that comprises the Upani\u1e63ads, which were\ntraditionally styled \u201cVed\u0101nta\u201d (\u201cculmination of\nthe Veda\u201d); indeed, the same word is more familiar to many modern readers as denoting Uttara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 itself. \n\n(On relations between these two\ntraditions of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, see the essays in Bronkhorst 2007.)\n\n\nJust as texts in the many strata of the Vedic corpus mostly represent\nthemselves as in some sense interpreting the texts that precede them,\nso, too, the philosophical tradition of P\u016brva\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (henceforth, simply\n\u201cM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u201d), in this regard typifying the generally scholastic character of first-millennium Indian philosophy, developed in the form of commentaries on the foundational texts of the tradition (and\ncommentaries on the commentaries, etc.). M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, as\nadherents of this school are called, thus take their bearings from the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras attributed to a\ncertain Jaimini, who is thought to have flourished near the beginning\nof the first millennium ce. The first of Jaimini\u2019s\ns\u016btras (\u201caphorisms\u201d) names \u201cthe desire\nto know dharma\u201d\n(dharmajij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101) as the constitutive concern\nof M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, where dharma is represented\nin early commentary simply as what \u201cconnects a person with the\nhighest good.\u201d Among the salient points about the goal thus\ncommended by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s foundational text is\nthat dharma, as here imagined, denotes a constitutively future\nstate of affairs; dharma, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas typically\nsay, is always \u201cyet to be\u201d (bhavi\u1e63yat).\n\n\nThis characterization of dharma can be taken to suggest that\nit has something to do with post-mortem existence states of affairs, which\nwere indeed among the expected results of certain Vedic rites.\n(Early proponents of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 differed from most other\nIndian philosophical schools in not taking liberation from\nsa\u1e43s\u0101ra to be the ultimate desideratum.) The\nperennially subjunctive character of talk of dharma perhaps\nmore significantly reflects, however, the view that Vedic injunctions\nessentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into being\n(bh\u0101van\u0101) of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed; it is insofar as no one ever finishes bringing this\nworld into being that its realization is always still to come. (See, on\nthis idea, Clooney 1990, 129\u2013161.) Philosophically, the significant\npoint is that, as always yet to be realized, the summum\nbonum for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas is essentially inaccessible\nto perception, and only language can be thought to represent a way of\nknowing it. This is surely the paramount intuition informing the entire\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project, which centers on confidence in the\nepistemic status of Vedic injunctions and the mind-independent reality\nof language.\n",
