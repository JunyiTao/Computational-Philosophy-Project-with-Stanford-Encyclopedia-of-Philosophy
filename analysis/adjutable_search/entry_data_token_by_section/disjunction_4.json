    "main_text": "Disjunction in conversation\n4. Disjunction in conversation\n\nThere are various conclusions one normally draws from the assertion of\na disjunctive sentence like\n (25):\n\n(25) Mary is\npatriotic or quixotic. \n  a.\nat least one of the two\nis true \n  b.\nat most one of the two\nis true [exclusive inference] \n  c.\nspeaker doesn\u2019t\nknow which is true [ignorance inference] \n\n\nSince only (25a) follows from the classical truth-functional account\nof disjunction, there seem to be a divergence in meaning between\n\\(\\vee\\) from classical logic and its natural language counterpart.\nGrice influentially argued that the assumption that such divergence\ndoes in fact exist is a mistake originating \u201cfrom inadequate\nattention to the nature and importance of the conditions governing\nconversation\u201d (Grice 1989: 24).\n\nExpanding on parts of Grice\u2019s celebrated argument (Grice 1989:\n44\u201346), suppose one would propose to analyze or in such\na way that not only (25a) would logically follow from\n (25)\n but also (25b) and/or (25c). A major problem for such a strong\nanalysis of or is that it would fail to account for the fact\nthat both the exclusive and the ignorance inferences are easily\ncancellable. One can say Mary invited John or Bill or both\n(cancellation of exclusive inference), or The prize is either in\nthe attic or in the garden. I know that because I know where I put it,\nbut I am not going to tell you (cancellation of ignorance-modal\ninference, from Grice 1989: 45). A strong theorist could then respond\nthat there are two senses of or, a strong one and a weak\n(truth-functional) one, with the latter employed in the previous cases\nof cancelation. But as Grice replied, \n\n\nif or is supposed to possess a strong sense, then it should\nbe possible for it (or) to bear this sense in a reasonably\nwide range of linguistic settings, for example it should be possible\nto say It is not the case that A or B where we are denying\nthat \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) (in the strong sense of or). (Grice\n1989: 45)\n\n\nThat this is not possible is illustrated by the oddity of the\nfollowing two cases: It is not the case that Mary invited John or\nBill, because she invited both or It is not the case that the\nprize is either in the attic or in the garden, because I know that it\nis in the garden. Since strong senses of or seem to be\nrestricted to \u201cunenclosed\u201d uses for which an alternative\nexplanation is available, Grice\u2019s conclusion is that only\n (25a)\n should be taken as part of the semantic contribution of the sentence\n(what is said). The exclusive and ignorance inferences in\n (25b)\n and\n (25c)\n are merely pragmatic effects (conversational implicatures) which\nderive from interactions between a weak (truth-functional)\ninterpretation of or with general principles of\nconversation.\n\nOn Grice\u2019s account, conversation is a purposeful and cooperative\nenterprise governed by what he calls the Cooperative Principle:\n\n(CP)  Make your\nconversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which\nit occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange\nin which you are engaged.\n\n\nSubsumed under this general principle, Grice distinguishes four\ncategories of more specific maxims, including the maxim of Quantity\n(here simplified).\n\n Quantity\n  (i)\n Make your contribution\nas informative as is required (for the current purposes of the\nexchange); \n  (ii)\n Do not make your\ncontribution more informative than is required. \n\n\nConversational implicatures are pragmatic inferences arising from the\ninterplay between basic (weak) semantic content and these principles\nof social interaction. A speaker conversationally implicates what she\nmust be assumed to believe in order to preserve the assumption that\nshe is adhering to the CP and maxims.\n\nGricean reasonings leading from the assertion of a disjunction to the\nignorance and exclusive inference can be summarized as follows:\n\n(26) Mary is\npatriotic or quixotic \\(\\Rightarrow\\) speaker doesn\u2019t know\nwhich \n  If the speaker had\nknown that Mary is patriotic, she should have said so (by Quantity).\nAssuming that the speaker made the most\ninformative relevant statement she could, the hearer can infer that\nthe speaker doesn\u2019t know that Mary is patriotic. Similar\nreasoning for the second disjunct. \n(27) Mary is\npatriotic or quixotic \\(\\Rightarrow\\) not both \n  If the speaker had\nknown that Mary is patriotic and quixotic, she should not have used\nor, but and (by Quantity).\nAssuming that the speaker made the most informative relevant statement\nshe could, the hearer can infer that the speaker doesn\u2019t know\nthat Mary is patriotic and quixotic. Assuming that the\nspeaker is opinionated (either believes (A and B) or believes not (A\nand B)) one can conclude that Mary is not patriotic and\nquixotic. \n\n\nThe assumption in\n (27)\n that the speaker must be opinionated about the conjunctive statement\nis however problematic. Given that the use of or implicates\nthat the speaker doesn\u2019t know which, why should there be any\npressure to think that the speaker would know both if it were true? A\nnumber of authors have indeed argued that Gricean implicatures are\nalways epistemically modalized: so in\n (27)\n only the proposition that the speaker doesn\u2019t know\nthat Mary is patriotic and quixotic is derivable by Gricean means\ncontra the predictions of the classical formalisation of\nGricean implicatures of Gazdar (1979) (see Soames 1982: 521 and Horn\n1989: 543). Many other attempts to formalization of (variations) of\nGricean reasonings have been proposed in the literature, including\nHorn (1984) but also the more recent Sauerland (2004), van Rooij and\nSchulz (2004) and Franke (2011). All these formalizations assume a\ntruth-functional analysis of disjunction and other connectives, as the\nbaseline for the pragmatic reasoning. In what follows we will discuss\nrecent developments in linguistic analysis of disjunction, including\nalso challenges to a Gricean pragmatic view.\n",
