    "main_text": "Importance and Applicability of the Distinction || Science and Everyday Discourse\n2.3 Science and Everyday Discourse\n\n\nOutside of philosophy and linguistics, scientists often quantify\nover types in their theories and refer to them by means of singular\nterms. When, for example, we read that the \u201cSpirit Bear\u201d is\na rare white bear that lives in rain forests along the British Columbia\ncoast, we know that no particular bear is rare, but rather a\ntype of bear. When we are told that these Kermode bears \u201chave a\nmutation in the gene for the melanocortin 1 receptor\u201d (The\nWashington Post 9/24/01 A16) we know that it is not a token\nmutation, token gene and token receptor being referred to, but a type.\nIt is even more evident that a type is being referred to when it is\nclaimed that \u201call men carry the same Y chromosome\u2026. This\none and only Y has the same sequence of DNA units in every man alive\nexcept for the occasional mutation that has cropped up every thousand\nyears\u201d (The New York Times, Nicholas Wade 5/27/03).\nSimilarly, to say the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct is to be\nreferring to a type, a species. (The status of species will be\ndiscussed in greater detail in \u00a74 below.)\n\n\nThe preceding paragraph contains singular terms that (apparently)\nrefer to types. An even more telling commitment to types are the\nfrequent quantifications over them. Mayr (1970, p. 233), for example,\ntells us that \u201cthere are about 28,500 subspecies of birds in a\ntotal of 8,600 species, an average of 3.3 subspecies per\nspecies\u202679 species of swallows have an average of 2.6\nsubspecies, while 70 species of cuckoo shrikes average 4.6\nsubspecies\u201d. Although these examples come from biology, physics\n(or any other science) would provide many examples too. It was claimed\n(in the sixties), for example, that \u201cthere are thirty particles,\nyet all but the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are\nunstable.\u201d Artifactual types (the Volvo 850 GLT, the Dell\nLatitude D610 laptop) easily lend themselves to reference also. In\nchess we are told that accepting the Queen's Gambit with 2\u2026dc\nhas been known since 1512, but Black must be careful in this\nopening\u2014the pawn snatch is too risky. Type-talk is ubiquitous.\n",
