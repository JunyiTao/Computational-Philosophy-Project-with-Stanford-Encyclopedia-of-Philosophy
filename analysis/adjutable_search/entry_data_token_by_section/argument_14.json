    "main_text": "Argumentation Across Fields of Inquiry and Social Practices || Argumentation theory\n4.1 Argumentation theory\n\nTo understand the emergence of argumentation theory as a specific\nfield of research in the twentieth century, a brief discussion of\npreceding events is necessary. In the nineteenth century, a number of\ntextbooks aiming to improve everyday reasoning via public education\nemphasized logical and rhetorical concerns, such as those by Richard\nWhately (see entry on\n fallacies).\n As noted in\n section 3.2,\n John Stuart Mill also had a keen interest in argumentation and its\nrole in public discourse (Mill 1859), as well as an interest in logic\nand reasoning (see entries on\n Mill\n and on\n fallacies).\n But with the advent of mathematical logic in the final decades of the nineteenth century,\nlogic and the study of ordinary, everyday argumentation came apart, as\nlogicians such as Frege, Hilbert, Russell etc. were primarily\ninterested in mathematical reasoning and argumentation. As a\nresult, their logical systems are not particularly suitable to study\neveryday argumentation, as this is simply not what they were designed\nto\n do.[6]\n\nNevertheless, in the twentieth century a number of authors took\ninspiration from developments in formal logic and expanded the use of\nlogical tools to the analysis of ordinary argumentation. A pioneer in\nthis tradition is Susan Stebbing, who wrote what can be seen as the\nfirst textbook in analytic philosophy, and then went on to write a\nnumber of books aimed at a general audience addressing everyday and\npublic discourse from a philosophical/logical perspective (see entry\non\n Susan Stebbing).\n Her 1939 book Thinking to Some Purpose, which can be\nconsidered as one of the first textbooks in critical thinking, was\nwidely read at the time, but did not become particularly influential\nfor the development of argumentation theory in the decades to\nfollow.\n\nBy contrast, Stephen Toulmin\u2019s 1958 book The Uses of\nArgument has been tremendously influential in a wide range of\nfields, including critical thinking education, rhetoric, speech\ncommunication, and computer science (perhaps even more so than in\nToulmin\u2019s own original field, philosophy). Toulmin\u2019s aim\nwas to criticize the assumption (widely held by Anglo-American\nphilosophers at the time) that any significant argument can be\nformulated in purely formal, deductive terms, using the formal logical\nsystems that had emerged in the preceding decades (see (Eemeren,\nGarssen, et al. 2014: ch. 4). While this critique was met with much\nhostility among fellow philosophers, it eventually gave rise to an\nalternative way of approaching argumentation, which is often described\nas \u201cinformal logic\u201d (see entry on\n informal logic).\n This approach seeks to engage and analyze instances of argumentation\nin everyday life; it recognizes that, while useful, the tools of\ndeductive logic alone do not suffice to investigate argumentation in\nall its complexity and pragmatic import. In a similar vein, Charles\nHamblin\u2019s 1970 book Fallacies reinvigorated the study\nof fallacies in the context of argumentation by re-emphasizing\n(following Aristotle) the importance of a dialectical-dialogical\nbackground when reflecting on fallacies in argumentation (see entry on\n fallacies).\n\nAround the same time as Toulmin, Cha\u00efm Perelman and Lucie\nOlbrechts-Tyteca were developing an approach to argumentation that\nemphasized its persuasive component. To this end, they turned to\nclassical theories of rhetoric, and adapted them to give rise to what\nthey described as the \u201cNew Rhetoric\u201d. Their book\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019argumentation: La nouvelle\nrh\u00e9torique was published in 1958 in French, and translated\ninto English in 1969. Its key idea: \n\n\nsince argumentation aims at securing the adherence of those to whom it\nis addressed, it is, in its entirety, relative to the audience to be\ninfluenced. (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca 1958 [1969: 19]) \n\n\nThey introduced the influential distinction between universal\nand particular audiences: while every argument is directed at\na specific individual or group, the concept of a universal audience\nserves as a normative ideal encapsulating shared standards of\nagreement on what counts as legitimate argumentation (see Eemeren,\nGarssen, et al. 2014: ch. 5).\n\nThe work of these pioneers provided the foundations for subsequent\nresearch in argumentation theory. One approach that became influential\nin the following decades is the pragma-dialectics tradition developed\nby Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (Eemeren & Grootendorst\n1984, 2004). They also founded the journal Argumentation, one\nof the flagship journals in argumentation theory. Pragma-dialectics\nwas developed to study argumentation as a discourse activity, a\ncomplex speech act that occurs as part of interactional linguistic\nactivities with specific communicative goals (\u201cpragma\u201d\nrefers to the functional perspective of goals, and\n\u201cdialectic\u201d to the interactive component). For these\nauthors, argumentative discourse is primarily directed at the\nreasonable resolution of a difference of opinion. Pragma-dialectics\nhas a descriptive as well as a normative component, thus offering\ntools both for the analysis of concrete instances of argumentation and\nfor the evaluation of argumentation correctness and success (see\nEemeren, Garssen, et al. 2014: ch. 10).\n\nAnother leading author in argumentation theory is Douglas Walton, who\npioneered the argument schemes approach to argumentation that borrows\ntools from formal logic but expands them so as to treat a wider range\nof arguments than those covered by traditional logical systems\n(Walton, Reed, & Macagno 2008). Walton also formulated an\ninfluential account of argumentation in dialogue in collaboration with\nErik Krabbe (Walton & Krabbe 1995). Ralph Johnson and Anthony\nBlair further helped to consolidate the field of argumentation theory\nand informal logic by founding the Centre for Research in Reasoning,\nArgumentation, and Rhetoric in Windsor (Ontario, Canada), and by\ninitiating the journal Informal Logic. Their textbook\nLogical Self-Defense (Johnson & Blair 1977) has also been\nparticularly influential.\n",
