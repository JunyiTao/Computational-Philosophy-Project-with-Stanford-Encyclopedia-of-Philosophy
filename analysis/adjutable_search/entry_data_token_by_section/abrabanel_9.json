    "main_text": "Philosophy of Love || Judah\u2019s Recasting of Love as a Philosophical Principle\n5.1 Judah\u2019s Recasting of Love as a Philosophical Principle\n\n\nThe traditional philosophical notion of love, going back at least to\nthe time of Plato, is that love results from the imperfection and\nprivation of that which loves. One loves, in other words, what\none does not possess (see, e.g., Plato, Symposium\n 200a-201e).[44] Accordingly,\n that which is imperfect loves that\nwhich is perfect, and, that which is perfect (i.e., God) neither loves\nnor desires. Aristotle likewise claimed that that which is less\nperfect (e.g., slaves, children, wives and ruled) should have more love\nfor that which is more perfect (e.g., freeborn, parents, husbands, and\nrulers) than vice versa. The First Cause, then, is loved\nbut does not love. This discussion would predominate from Late\nAntiquity to the Middle Ages.\n\n\nJudah\u2019s theory of love, by contrast, was intimately connected\nto the literary interests of humanism and the aesthetic sensibilities\nof Renaissance\n artists.[45]  \n As a consequence, Judah faults previous\nthinkers for (1) not ascribing love to God and (2) confining their\ndiscussion of love primarily to that between humans, thereby ignoring\nthe dynamic role of God in relationships based on this principle. \nUsing the name of Plato as a metonym for other philosophers, he is\ncritical of this approach:\n\n\n\nPlato in his Symposium discusses only the kind of love that\nis found in men, which has its final cause in the lover but not in the\nbeloved (terminato ne l\u2019amante ma non ne l\u2019amato),\nfor this kind mainly is called love, since that which ends in the loved\none is called friendship and benevolence (ch\u00e9 quel che si\ntermina ne l\u2019amato si chiama amicizia e\nbenivolenzia). He rightly defines this love as a desire of\nbeauty (desiderio di bellezza). He says that such love\nis not found in God, because that which desires beauty and\ndoesn\u2019t have it is not beautiful, and God, who is the highest\nbeauty, does not lack beauty nor can he desire it, whence he cannot\nhave love, that is, of such a kind (Tale amore dice che non si\ntruova in Dio, per\u00f2 che quel che desia bellezza non\nl\u2019ha n\u00e9 \u00e8 bello, e a Dio, che \u00e8 sommo\nbello, non gli manca bellezza n\u00e9 la pu\u00f2 desiare,\nonde non pu\u00f2 avere amore, cio\u00e8 di tal\n sorte).[46]\n\n\n\nJudah seeks to provide a corrective to this and, in the process,\noffer what he considers to be a more comprehensive theory of\nlove. In particular, he intertwines love and beauty such that the\nlover of beauty seeks to unite with the source of beauty, something\nthat the lover subsequently seeks to reproduce himself (the lover is\nalways male, according to Judah because it is responsible for\nimpregnating the passive and receptive female principle). This\ncan take the form of God\u2019s creation of the universe, the\nartist\u2019s creation of a work of art, and the philosopher\u2019s\ncomposition of a pleasing work of philosophy. In his discussion\nof love, Judah also departs from other Renaissance thinkers. Whereas\nFicino had equated human love with sensual love between humans, Judah,\ndrawing upon Maimonidean precedents, resignifies human love as, on one\nlevel, that which the intellect has for\n God.[47]\n\n\nPerhaps, Judah\u2019s biggest departure from earlier thinkers is\nhis ascription of love to God. Here, however, his discussion is\nnot entirely new; rather, he picks up on a number of issues discussed\nin the work of Hasdai Crescas (ca. 1340\u2013ca. 1410), the important critic\nof Aristotelianism and Maimonideanism. For Crescas, breaking from\nboth the Platonic and Aristotelian positions, love need not be\nassociated with privation or imperfection:\n\n\n\nInasmuch as it is known that God, may He be blessed, is the sources\nand fountain of all perfection, and in virtue of his perfection, which\nis His essence, He loves the good, as may be seen from His actions in\nbringing into existence the entire universe, sustaining it perpetually,\nand continuously creating it anew, and all be means of His simple will,\nit must necessarily be that the love of the good is an essential\nproperty of perfection. It follows from this that the greater\nperfection [of the lover] the greater will be the love and the pleasure\nin the\n desire.[48]\n\n\n\nLove, for Crescas, is tantamount to God\u2019s creative\nactivity. In the third book of the Dialoghi Judah picks\nup this theme:\n\n\n\nDivine Love (L\u2019amor divino) is the inclination\n(tendenzia) of God\u2019s most beautiful wisdom toward the\nlikeness of His own beauty, to wit, the universe created by Him,\ntogether with its return to union with His supreme wisdom; and His\npleasure is the perfect union of His image with Himself (la\nperfetta unione di sua immagine in se stesso), and of His\ncreated universe with Himself as\n Creator.[49]\n\n\n\nJudah\u2019s subsequent discussion of love, however, departs\nsignificantly from either Crescas or other Renaissance thinkers. \nThis is especially the case when it comes to Judah\u2019s refusal to\nabnegate sensual love. Rather, he celebrates such love as the\ngateway to cosmic or spiritual love.   Sensual love, for him,\nbecomes that which orientates the individual towards the Divine. \nUnlike Crescas, however, Judah does not reject the Maimonidean concept\nof God as divine intellect. Furthermore, Judah\u2019s discussion\nfinds no homolog in the thought of Crescas or even Maimonides when it\ncomes to the concept of God\u2019s beauty.\n",
