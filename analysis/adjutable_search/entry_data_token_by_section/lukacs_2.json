    "main_text": "Early Writings || Life and Form\n2.1 Life and Form\n\nExcept for the History of the Modern Drama (1909),\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s earliest work is self-consciously essayistic in\nform. As Luk\u00e1cs explains in \u201cOn the Nature and Form of\nthe Essay\u201d (1911a), this is because the essay addresses life\nthrough the medium of form (1911a: 8) and takes form (in particular,\nthe form of a work of art) seriously as a subject. Essayistic writing\nis not only writing about form, however; it must always\nexamine the conditions under which life can be given form in the first\nplace. Modernity has made this problem more virulent insofar as the\nexisting means by which life can give itself form have become\nproblematic, such that we now experience them as abstractions.\n\nFollowing Weber, Luk\u00e1cs characterizes the bourgeois form of\nlife in terms of the primacy of an ethics of work and inner strength.\nCorresponding to this form of life, Luk\u00e1cs claims, there was\nonce a form of art that was capable of expressing an unproblematic\nrelationship between life and form (for example, in Theodor Storm\u2019s\ncase, the insight that the bourgeois citizen must concentrate on work\nand entrust the formation of life to fate; see 1910a: 60). However,\nwhen that bourgeois life-form disappeared, the remaining bourgeois\n\u201cway of life\u201d was transformed into a kind of asceticism\nthat grew hostile to life itself. The same holds for the corresponding\nmovement, within art, of rejecting life in favor of \u201cart for its\nown sake,\u201d that is, a form of artistic production that\nself-consciously (and with justification) refuses to express life\nbecause it has no foundation in a corresponding life form.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs thus argues that modern art is caught in the dilemma of\nhaving to achieve harmony between life and form, either at the expense\nof life\u2019s intensity or at a purely symbolic and imaginary\nlevel\u2014by effectively withdrawing from life (an idea he discusses\nin reference to Novalis; see 1908: 50; see also Butler 2010: 9). In\nboth cases, art turns against life. By contrast, a genuine attempt to\ngive \u201creal\u201d or \u201cabsolute life\u201d (that is,\ngenuinely meaningful life as opposed to the chaos of \u201cempirical\nlife\u201d; see Kavoulakos 2014: 22\u201326; M\u00e1rkus 1983: 11;\nL\u00f6wy 1979: 104) a distinct form necessarily involves the\nrejection of the meaningless necessities of ordinary life. In\n\u201cThe Metaphysics of Tragedy\u201d (1910b), Luk\u00e1cs\nascribes this task to modern tragedy. When nature and fate have become\n\u201cterrifyingly soulless\u201d (1910b: 154) and any hope for a\n\u201cfriendly order\u201d (ibid.) has disappeared, the tragic\nbecomes a task\u2014that of rejecting ordinary life in favor of the\nopportunity to \u201clive within the periphery of tragedy\u201d\n(1910b: 173).\n\nThe ethical dimension of the relation between life and form is made\nmost explicit in Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s essay on Kierkegaard and in\n\u201cOn Poverty of Spirit.\u201d Kierkegaard\u2019s rejection of\nRegine Olsen\u2019s love is lauded for its expression of the need to give\none\u2019s own empirical life a definite, unambiguous form, thereby\ntransforming it into absolute life\u2014in Kierkegaard\u2019s case, by\nattempting to perform an authentic gesture (1910c: 28). Yet\nKierkegaard\u2019s ethical position suffered from a defect: he attempted\nto reconcile ordinary life with a form that was only appropriate for\ngenuine, \u201cabsolute\u201d life. Due to its inherent ambiguity\nand foreignness to form, ordinary life cannot ever be successfully\nlived in such a way (1910c: 40). Thus, Kierkegaard\u2019s attempt to live\na genuine life was doomed from the start.\n\nThe conclusion of this line of thought seems to point towards an\ninsoluble dilemma. But the 1911 essay \u201cOn Poverty of\nSpirit\u201d\u2014a fusion of an autobiographical reflection on\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s role in Irma Seidler\u2019s suicide and an examination\nof theoretical issues\u2014points to a different conclusion: the\nrejection of an \u201cethics of duty.\u201d Luk\u00e1cs argues\nthat our adherence to a formal, rule-based ethics is to be blamed for\nour alienation from life. Even though the submission to\n\u201cform\u201d that is implicit in adopting a formalist ethics is\nthe basis from which social life becomes possible in the first place,\nit prevents people from forming \u201chuman relationships.\u201d As\nLuk\u00e1cs writes, \u201c[f]orm [\u2026] is like a bridge that\nseparates\u201d (1911b: 44). Luk\u00e1cs contrasts such an ethics\nwith the ideal of \u201cgoodness,\u201d which represents \u201creal\nlife.\u201d \u201cGoodness\u201d involves a rejection of rules and\nduties towards others in favor of pure actions that may be sinful,\nchaotic, and futile. The soul of the good person, Luk\u00e1cs\nclaims, \u201cis a pure white slate, upon which fate writes its\nabsurd command\u201d (1911b: 48). This anti-consequentialist and\nanti-deontological ethics of pure action ultimately culminates in a\nconception of \u201cworks.\u201d Only by sacrificing themselves for\nthe sake of works can people (or, as Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s narrator\nclaims, \u201cmen\u201d) empty themselves of the psychological\ncontent of everyday life and prepare themselves for the grace of\ngoodness. This final line of thought points towards a social utopia:\nby overcoming the alienated world of \u201cmechanical forces\u201d\n(1911b: 45) through works that transform life, we may recover a\ngenuine community with and a direct knowledge of others wherein\n\u201csubject and object collapse into each other\u201d (1911b: 46).\nThis vision of a final overcoming of alienation seems to offer a way\nout of the theoretical impasse of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s earlier position,\nbut at the cost of endorsing ethical decisionism.\n",
