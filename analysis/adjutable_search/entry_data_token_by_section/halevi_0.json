    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nJudah Halevi (c. 1075\u20131141) was one of the most gifted Hebrew\npoets and talented philosophical theologians of medieval Spain. He was\nborn to an enlightened family of means living in Tudela, a town in\nnortheastern Spain under Muslim rule. He received a comprehensive\neducation in both Hebrew and Arabic sources, encompassing the Bible,\nrabbinic literature, grammar, Arabic and Hebrew poetry, philosophy,\ntheology, and medicine.  As a youth, he traveled to southern Spain\n(al-Andalus) and was quickly recognized for his poetic ability after\nwinning a contest in Cordova in which entrants were asked to write a\npoem matching the complex style of a composition by the famed Moses\nibn Ezra. The renowned poet befriended the young man and brought him\nto Granada where he was welcomed into courtier circles, enjoyed ibn\nEzra's patronage, and composed numerous poems on mainly secular themes\nover several years.\n\n\nThis period of stability, discovery, and high culture was disrupted by\nthe invasion of the Almoravids, a fanatical Islamic sect from North\nAfrica, in 1090. After taking control of the petty kingdoms of\nal-Andalus, in response to the fall of Toledo to the Christian armies\nof Alphonso VI, Jewish life in Granada and beyond began to deteriorate\nrapidly. Halevi left Granada in search of a more secure situation and\neventually settled in Toledo, where his reputation as both a poet and\nphysician preceded him. He was again received with honor and admiration\nby the courtier Jews of the city, but he now supported himself as a\ncourt physician. Nevertheless, clashes been Muslims and Christians, and\ndistrust of Jews on both sides of the divide, caused Halevi increasing\ndismay over how fragile Jewish life in Spain had become. His secular\npoetry reflects these developments in its numerous references to loss,\ngrief, and dislocation. As he puts it in one of his poems,\n\n\nBetween the armies of Seir [the Christians] and Kedar [the Muslims]\nMy army perishes and is lost \u2026\nWhen they fight their wars\nWe fall with their fall \u2026\n\n\nNot long after 1108, the year his patron in Toledo, Solomon ibn\nFerruziel, was murdered, Halevi began to move from city to city. He\ntraveled in the company of his close friend and younger colleague,\nAbraham ibn Ezra, the grammarian, biblical exegete, and Neo-Platonic\nphilosopher. As his fame spread, Halevi enlarged his circle of\nfriendships and contacts as far as North Africa and Egypt. One of\nthese, Abu Said Halfon Ha-Levi of Damietta, a distinguished Jewish\nmerchant with whom Halevi corresponded and finally met in person in\n1127, became an especially trusted friend and partner in efforts to\nransom Jewish captives. He would later become Halevi's host in\nEgypt.\n\n\nBy this time, Halevi was at the height of his career in Spain. He had\nby then married and had a daughter, who would be married to Isaac ibn\nEzra, the son of his friend Abraham. His secular and religious poetry\nmade him a celebrated figure throughout Spain and beyond. He had also\nwritten the first drafts of what he called the \u201cKhazari\nbook,\u201d which was undertaken in response to questions raised by\nan unnamed heretical thinker, possibly a Karaite. It would eventually\nbe reworked to become his most famous religio-philosophical work, the\nKuzari or Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf of the\nDespised Religion.  However, he had gradually become convinced\nthat a secure Jewish life in Spain was no longer viable and certainly\nnot for him. His religious poetry increasingly attested to an intense\nlonging for communion with God and also for a return to Zion. As the\nChristian policy of reconquering territories lost to the Muslims\nproceeded apace, and in the wake of the First Crusade, messianic\nexpectations grew. He even records in one of his poems a prophetic\ndream that forecast the downfall of the oppressive Islamic regimes in\nthe year 1130.\n\n\nIt is likely that the failure of the redemption to come as predicted\nonly strengthened his resolve to perform a redeeming act of his own,\nnamely, to emigrate to the Land of Israel and devote himself entirely\nto the religious life he describes in his writings. In the late summer\nof 1140, he departed for Egypt, accompanied by his son-in-law, Isaac.\nHis correspondence and poetry attest that he remained there until\nmid-May of 1141, despite attempts to set sail for the Holy Land\nearlier. It is possible that he arrived in Ashkalon by the end of May,\nand many scholars support this view. However, no documentary evidence\nconfirms this. A letter from his friend Halfon confirms only that Judah\nHalevi died in July of 1141.\n",
