Values and their\nassociated imperatives are absolute when they are thought to apply to\nall human beings, at all times irrespective of social or historical\nconditions. This is because absolutist conceptions of values are\nderived from, and ultimately justified by something other than the\nlived-experiences of human beings, be it God, or human rationality.\nWhereas pluralism is intended to accommodate a wide array of\ncontending values, absolutism countenances one, and only one set of\nvalues universally applicable to all human beings. Locke claims that\n\u201cabsolutism has come forward again in new and formidable\nguise,\u201d and he warns us to be on guard for \u201csocial and\npolitical forms of it, with their associated intellectual tyrannies of\nauthoritarian dogmatism and uniformitarian universality\u201d (PID\n53). These newer forms of absolutism, Locke claimed, are the products\nof older ones. When values are held to be absolute there often results\na tendency to discount the legitimacy of rival values. Pluralism\navoids conceiving of values in absolutist terms. Setting various value\nconceptions on equal footing is the aim of Locke's pluralism.\n\nUniformitarianism, the second obstacle to pluralism, is the view that\nvalues ought to be uniform within a given community or group. The\nexperiences of members of a given group are filtered through the same\nforms of mediation to produce value uniformity. Values are ascribed a\nsingle form for all members of a group; rather than allowing for a\nmultiplicity of mediated experiences. Value uniformity can be achieved\nviolently, coercively or peacefully, but in all instances it is an\nattempt to replace diversity with homogeneity. Locke suspects that it\nis the desire to defend one's own culture and to create consensus\namong competing value claims that is at the root of the quest for\nuniformity. Unfortunately, that motivation can easily lapse into an\nattempt to force one's own value system onto others without\njustification. Uniformitarianism is a refusal to accommodate the\nmyriad value forms that are essential to pluralism.\n\nFinally, Locke warns us to avoid the pitfalls of arbitrariness and\ndogmatism. Value commitments are arbitrary when one forms\nthem\u2014thereby rejecting viable alternatives\u2014in the absence\nof any justification for choosing them over other available options.\nOne holds her values dogmatically when she takes them to be\nindisputable and is closed-off to the possibility of taking a critical\nview of her value commitments that could possibly result in her\naltering or rejecting them.\n",
