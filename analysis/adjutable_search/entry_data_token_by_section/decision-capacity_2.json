    "main_text": "Moral Origins\n2. Moral Origins\n\nThe origins of our contemporary concept of decisional capacity lie in\na varied configuration of historical developments in health care law\nand ethics that accompany the rise of the doctrine of informed\nconsent. According to the most well developed and widely accepted\naccount of this doctrine, the moral purpose of requiring informed\nconsent in certain contexts is to promote and protect the autonomy of\npatients and research subjects (Faden & Beauchamp 1986). It is\ncommonly observed that respect for autonomy \n\n\nflows from the recognition that all persons have unconditional worth,\neach having the capacity to determine his or her own moral destiny.\n(Beauchamp & Childress 2001: 63\u20134). \n\n\nTo respect autonomy means that, \n\n\nwe have a fundamental obligation to ensure that patients have the\nright to choose, as well as the right to accept or decline\ninformation. (Beauchamp & Childress 2001: 63) \n\n\nOf course, the obligation to allow people to choose is only an\nobligation where the individuals in question can meaningfully be said\nto choose for themselves. Thus the need to define decisional capacity\nenters as soon as we try to define the scope of this obligation.\n\nTypically, in order to be deemed legally and ethically valid an\nindividual\u2019s consent must be properly informed and free of\nexternal coercion (Faden & Beauchamp 1986). Given that in most\nmedical contexts there is a huge asymmetry in possession of knowledge,\ndisclosure is usually required to ensure that the subject is informed,\nand is often listed as a requirement. Against this backdrop decisional\ncapacity is often thought of as a fourth requirement of validity. Thus\nmany health care professionals think of informed consent in terms of a\nfour-part checklist:\n\nSubject must have decisional-capacity.\nAll relevant information must be disclosed to the subject.\nThe subject must understand what has been conveyed.\nThe subject makes a voluntary choice either accepting or refusing\nwhat has been offered or proposed. \n\n\nPhilosophers might naturally suppose that moral theorizing about\ninformed consent would lead to and shape a theory of decisional\ncapacity. After all, if the point of informed consent is to enable and\npromote autonomous decision-making, one might naturally suppose that\nthe task is to distinguish those who can actually make autonomous\ndecisions from those who cannot. This, in turn, would require a more\ndetailed account of what goes into an autonomous decision. However,\nthis is not what one finds in the literature, and for good reason. To\nbegin with, to take such ideas seriously one would have to have an\nindependent theory of autonomous decision-making that was concrete\nenough to guide practice, i.e., the development of tests and\ninstruments. But philosophical theories of autonomy are, at least\ncurrently, far too abstract for this purpose. Moreover they are\ntypically far too demanding (i.e., they appear to count far too many\ndecisions as\n non-autonomous).[1]\n So, interestingly, although many philosophers and bioethicists\ncontinue to equate decisional capacity and the capacity for autonomous\ndecision-making, it is really not true that our current notion of\ndecisional capacity has been derived from the notion of\nautonomous decision-making. Instead, the current notion of decisional\ncapacity has been built from the ground up, largely (though not\nentirely) independently of philosophical theory. And this means that\nit is an open question whether a competent decision is an autonomous\ndecision.\n",
