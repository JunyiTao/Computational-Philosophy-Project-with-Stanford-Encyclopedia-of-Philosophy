    "main_text": "The Structure of Knowledge and Justification || Coherentism\n4.2 Coherentism\n\nFoundationalism says that knowledge and justification are structured\nlike a building, consisting of a superstructure that rests upon a\nfoundation. According to coherentism, this metaphor gets things wrong.\nKnowledge and justification are structured like a web where\nthe strength of any given area depends on the strength of the\nsurrounding areas. Coherentists, then, deny that there are any basic\nbeliefs. As we saw in the previous section, there are two different\nways of conceiving of basicality. Consequently, there are two\ncorresponding ways of construing coherentism: as the denial of\ndoxastic basicality or as the denial of epistemic basicality. Consider\nfirst coherentism as the denial of doxastic basicality:\n\n\nDoxastic Coherentism\n\nEvery justified belief receives its justification from other beliefs\nin its epistemic neighborhood.\n\n\nLet us apply this thought to the hat example we considered in\n Section 3.1.\n Suppose again you notice someone\u2019s hat and believe\n\n(H) That hat is\nblue.\n\n\nLet\u2019s agree that (H) is justified. According to coherentism, (H)\nreceives its justification from other beliefs in the epistemic\nvicinity of (H). They constitute your evidence or your reasons for\ntaking (H) to be true. Which beliefs might make up this set of\njustification-conferring neighborhood beliefs?\n\nWe will consider two approaches to answering this question. The first\nis known as inference to the best explanation. Such\ninferences generate what is called explanatory coherence (see\nchapter 7 in Harman 1986). According to this approach, we must suppose\nyou form a belief about the way the hat appears to you in your\nperceptual experiences, and a second belief to the effect that your\nperceptual experience, the hat\u2019s looking blue to you, is best\nexplained by the hypothesis that (H) is true. So the relevant set of\nbeliefs is the following:\n\n(1) I am\nhaving a visual experience (E): the hat looks blue to me.\n(2) My having\n(E) is best explained by assuming that (H) is true.\n\n\nThere are of course alternative explanations of why you have (E).\nPerhaps you are hallucinating that the hat is blue. Perhaps an evil\ndemon makes the hat look blue to you when in fact it is red. Perhaps\nyou are the sort of person to whom hats always look blue. An\nexplanatory coherentist would say that, compared with these, the\nhat\u2019s actual blueness is a superior explanation. That\u2019s\nwhy you are justified in believing (H). Note that an explanatory\ncoherentist can also explain the lack of justification.\nSuppose you remember that you just took a hallucinatory drug that\nmakes things look blue to you. That would prevent you from being\njustified in believing (H). The explanatory coherentist can account\nfor this by pointing out that, in the case we are considering now, the\ntruth of (H) would not be the best explanation of why you are\nhaving experience (E). Rather, your having taken the hallucinatory\ndrug would explain your having (E) at least as well as the hypothesis\n(H) would explain it. That\u2019s why, according to the explanatory\ncoherentist, in this variation of our original case you are not\njustified in believing (H).\n\nOne challenge for explanatory coherentists is to explain what makes\none explanation better than another. Let\u2019s use the evil demon\nhypothesis to illustrate this challenge. What we need is an\nexplanation of why you are having (E). According to the evil demon\nhypothesis, you are having (E) because the evil demon is causing you\nto have (E), in order to trick you. The explanatory coherentist would\nsay that, if the bulk of our beliefs about the mind-independent world\nare justified, then this \u201cevil demon\u201d hypothesis is a bad\nexplanation of why you are having (E). But why is it bad? What we need\nto answer this question is a general and principled account of what\nmakes one explanation better than another. Suppose we appeal to the\nfact that you are not justified in believing in the existence\nof evil demons. The general idea would be this: If there are two\ncompeting explanations, E1 and E2, and E1 consists of or includes a\nproposition that you are not justified in believing whereas E2 does\nnot, then E2 is better than E1. The problem with this idea is that it\nputs the cart before the horse. Explanatory coherentism is supposed to\nhelp us understand what it is for beliefs to be justified. It\ndoesn\u2019t do that if it accounts for the difference between better\nand worse explanations by making use of the difference between\njustified and unjustified belief. If explanatory coherentism were to\nproceed in this way, it would be a circular, and thus uninformative,\naccount of justification. So the challenge that explanatory\ncoherentism must meet is to give an account, without using the concept\nof justification, of what makes one explanation better than\nanother.\n\nLet us move on to the second way in which the coherentist approach\nmight be carried out. Recall what a subject\u2019s justification for\nbelieving p is all about: possessing a link between the belief\nthat p and p\u2019s truth. Suppose the subject knows\nthat the origin of her belief that p is reliable. So she knows\nthat beliefs coming from this source tend to be true. Such knowledge\nwould give her an excellent link between the belief and its truth. So\nwe might say that the neighborhood beliefs which confer justification\non (H) are the following:\n\n(1) I am having a\nvisual experience (E): the hat looks blue to me. \n(3)Experiences\nlike (E) are reliable.\n\n\nCall coherentism of this kind reliability coherentism. If you\nbelieve (1) and (3), you are in possession of a good reason for\nthinking that the hat is indeed blue. So you are in possession of a\ngood reason for thinking that the belief in question, (H), is true.\nThat\u2019s why, according to reliability coherentism, you are\njustified in believing (H).\n\nLike explanatory coherentism, this view faces a circularity problem.\nIf (H) receives its justification in part because you also believe\n(3), (3) itself must be justified. But where would your justification\nfor (3) come from? One answer would be: from your memory of perceptual\nsuccess in the past. You remember that your visual experiences have\nhad a good track record. They have rarely led you astray. The problem\nis that you can\u2019t justifiably attribute a good track record to\nyour perceptual faculties without using your perceptual faculties. So\nif reliability coherentism is going to work, it would have to be\nlegitimate to use a faculty for the very purpose of establishing the\nreliability of that faculty itself. But it is not clear that this is\n legitimate.[47]\n\nWe have seen that explanatory coherentism and reliability coherentism\neach face its own distinctive circularity problem. Since both are\nversions of doxastic coherentism, they both face a further\ndifficulty: Do people, under normal circumstances, really form beliefs\nlike (1), (2), and (3)? It would seem they do not. It could be\nobjected, therefore, that these two versions of coherentism make\nexcessive intellectual demands of ordinary subjects who are unlikely\nto have the background beliefs that, according to these versions of\ncoherentism, are needed for justification. This objection could be\navoided by stripping coherentism of its doxastic element. The result\nwould be the following version of coherentism, which results from\nrejecting EB (the epistemic conception of basicality):\n\n\nDependence Coherentism\n\nWhenever one is justified in believing a proposition\np1, one\u2019s justification for believing\np1 depends on justification one has for believing\nsome further propositions, p1, p2,\n\u2026 pn.\n\n\nAn explanatory coherentist might say that, for you to be justified in\nbelieving (H), it\u2019s not necessary that you actually\nbelieve\n(1)\n and\n (2).\n However, it is necessary that you have justification for\nbelieving (1) and (2). It is your having justification for (1) and (2)\nthat gives you justification for believing (H). A reliability\ncoherentist might make an analogous point. She might say that, to be\njustified in believing (H), you need not believe anything about the\nreliability of your belief\u2019s origin. You must, however, have\njustification for believing that your belief\u2019s origin is\nreliable; that is, you must have justification for (1) and\n (3).\n Both versions of dependence coherentism, then, rest on the\nsupposition that it is possible to have justification for a\nproposition without actually believing that proposition.\n\nDependence coherentism is a significant departure from the way\ncoherentism has typically been construed by its advocates. According\nto the typical construal of coherentism, a belief is justified, only\nif the subject has certain further beliefs that constitute\nreasons for the given belief. Dependence coherentism rejects this.\nAccording to it, justification need not come in the form of beliefs.\nIt can come in the form of introspective and memorial experience, so\nlong as such experience gives a subject justification for beliefs\nabout either reliability or explanatory coherence. In fact, dependence\ncoherentism allows for the possibility that a belief is justified, not\nby receiving any of its justification from other beliefs, but\nsolely by suitable perceptual experiences and memory\n experience.[48]\n\nNext, let us examine some of the reasons provided in the debate over\nfoundationalism and coherentism.\n",
