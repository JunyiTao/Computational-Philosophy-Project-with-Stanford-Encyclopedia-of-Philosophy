    "main_text": "Regress and Theoretical Vices || Regress and Failure of Analysis\n1.3 Regress and Failure of Analysis\n\nIn the previous section we saw two theories generating similar\nregresses, but where one is found unobjectionable whereas the other is\nfound objectionable due to the different things we think we know,\nindependently of encountering these regress arguments, about the\nsubject matter of the theories. We could also have cases where a\nsingle theory yields a regress that is objectionable by the lights of\none theorist and not another, as a result of their differing\ntheoretical commitments leading one but not the other to think that a\nfeature revealed by the regress is a vice. (See Cameron 2022, section\n1.3.)\n\nConsider Bradley\u2019s regress. (Bradley 1893 [1968], (21\u201329).\nNote, however, that Bradley is very hard to interpret, and there is\nmuch debate concerning how to reconstruct his argument. See the entry\non\n Bradley\u2019s regress\n for discussion.) We start with the demand to give an account of\npredication: what is it for \\(A\\) to be \\(F\\)? One answer is that it\nis for the particular \\(A\\) to be bound to the property of \\(F\\)-ness.\nBut this answer yields a new predication: \\(A\\) is bound to\n\\(F\\)-ness. If the original monadic predication of \\(A\\) demands an\naccount, this relational predication of \\(A\\) and \\(F\\)-ness also\ndemands an account. Since before we posited a property corresponding\nto the monadic predicate and said that the property was bound to the\nobject that was the subject of predication, we should follow suit here\nand posit a relation corresponding to the dyadic predicate and say\nthat it is bound to the two things that are the subjects of that\npredication. So we should posit a relation\u2014let\u2019s call it\ninstantiation\u2014that binds together \\(A\\) and \\(F\\)-ness.\nBut this yields another new predication: Instantiation binds \\(A\\) to\n\\(F\\)-ness. Now this triadic predication needs to be accounted for,\nand so we need a relation corresponding to the triadic\npredicate\u2014let\u2019s call it the instantiation\\(_2\\)\nrelation\u2014that binds together the instantiation relation, \\(A\\),\nand \\(F\\)-ness. But this yields yet another predication, this time a\ntetradic one: Instantiation\\(_2\\) binds Instantiation to \\(A\\) and\n\\(F\\)-ness\u2026 And so on. Each predicational fact tells us that\nsome particulars, properties, and relations are bound together, which\nforces us to posit a relation corresponding to that binding, which\ngenerates the next predicational fact, and so on ad\ninfinitum.\n\nIs this regress objectionable? Arguably it depends on what we want\nfrom an account of predication. If what you want is an\nanalysis of predication, then arguably this regress\nis objectionable. If you start off not understanding\npredication\u2014if you find it just utterly mysterious what\n\u2018\\(A\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019 is meant to mean, given that this\n\u2018is\u2019 is not identity\u2014then this regress means that\nthis account is not going to help you, for each answer simply invokes\nanother predication, which is exactly what you don\u2019t understand.\nIf you don\u2019t understand \u2018\\(A\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019,\nyou\u2019re not going to understand \u2018\\(A\\) is bound to\n\\(F\\)-ness\u2019, or \u2018Instantiation is bound to \\(A\\) and\n\\(F\\)-ness\u2019, or etc., since the \u2018is\u2019 in those claims\nis also not the \u2018is\u2019 of identity but the \u2018is\u2019\nof predication, which you find a mystery. However, if you\nunderstand predication perfectly fine and want simply an\nontological account of it\u2014an account of what in the\nworld makes true the true predications\u2014then arguably\nthe regress is not objectionable, because while there are\ninfinitely many true predications, these can all be made true by the\none underlying state of the world: the state of affairs of the\nparticular \\(A\\) being bound to the property \\(F\\)-ness. Just as this\nstate of affairs makes it true that \\(A\\) is \\(F\\), so does it make it\ntrue that \\(A\\) is bound to \\(F\\)-ness, and that this binding holds\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(F\\)-ness, and etc. We would have one ontological\nunderpinning for the infinitely many true predications. As Nolan\n(2008a, 182) puts it, we have \u201cOntology for each truth, and no\ninfinite regress of [states of affairs], but only of descriptions of\n[states of affairs]: and it should never be thought that an infinite\nregress of descriptions is something to worry about per se\u201d.\n(Cf. Armstrong 1974 and 1997 (157\u20138).) So whether or not we will\nfind this regress objectionable depends on what we demand of an\naccount of predication. We can all agree that the regress shows that\nthe account does not yield an analysis of predication. Is this a\ntheoretical vice? It depends on whether or not predication requires an\nanalysis, and that depends on our theoretical goals.\n\nAnother regress that arguably fits this pattern is McTaggart\u2019s\n(1908) regress argument against the reality of the A-series of time.\nThe A-series of time is the sequence of times one of which is present,\nothers past, and others future. (As opposed to the B-series, which\nmerely says that some times are before others, some after others,\netc., without singling out any as being past, present, or future.)\nBut, says McTaggart, the times that are past, were present;\nthe time that is present was future and will be\npast; the times that are future will be present and will\nbe past. McTaggart concludes that we end up attributing each\nA-property (is present, is past, and is future) to\nevery time (and therefore to every event in time). But this is absurd,\nbecause the A-properties are incompatible: to have one is to have\nneither of the others. So we end up in contradiction: each time both\nhas only one such property, and all such properties. McTaggart\nconcludes that the A-series cannot be real.\n\nAn obvious response to McTaggart\u2019s argument is this: it\u2019s\nnot that some future time is present and past as well,\nit\u2019s merely that it will be present and will\nbe (later still) past. That is: no time and event has\nmore than one of the A-properties, it is merely the case that they\nhave one A-property and did and will have another.\nBut McTaggart thinks this response does not solve the problem, because\nit leads to regress. He says (ibid., 469):\n\n\nIf we avoid the incompatibility of the three characteristics by\nasserting that M is present, has been future, and will be past, we are\nconstructing a second A series, within which the first falls, in the\nsame way in which events fall within the first\u2026 the second A\nseries will suffer from the same difficulty as the first, which can\nonly be removed by placing it inside a third A series. The same\nprinciple will place the third inside a fourth, and so on without end.\nYou can never get rid of the contradiction, for, by the act of\nremoving it from what is to be explained, you produce it over again in\nthe explanation. And so the explanation is invalid.\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument is difficult and philosophers disagree on\nhow to interpret it, but here is one interpretation. (See Dummett 1960\nand Mellor 1998 (72\u201374) for two among many presentations of the\nargument along similar lines. See Cameron 2015 (Ch. 2) and Skow 2015\n(Ch. 6) for recent discussion.)\n\nThe way things were and the way things will be seems to be part of\nreality in a way that, for example, Bilbo\u2019s finding the One Ring\nis not, it\u2019s merely part of a fiction. History is not a\nfiction, it\u2019s part of our world, so historical truths and future\ntruths should, seemingly, be part of the overall account of how the\nworld is. But that is puzzling, given that things change and,\nhence, the way things were is incompatible with the way things are\nnow. How can they both contribute to the way reality is if\nthey are incompatible? McTaggart\u2019s argument focuses on a\nparticular instance of this concerning the A-properties.\nCaesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon is past. But it was\npresent, and so its presentness is a feature of our world\u2019s\nhistory. But our world\u2019s history, as we just said, is part of\nthe complete account of how our world is, and so the complete\naccount of how our world is includes both Caesar\u2019s crossing the\nRubicon being past and it being present, and yet those are\nincompatible features. The defender of the A-series replies by\ninsisting that in giving the complete account of how reality is we\nhave to take seriously the fact that reality changes and that\nit is, therefore, different ways successively, and there is\nno inconsistency in things being one way and then another,\nincompatible, way. So it\u2019s not that reality is such that\nCaesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon is both past and present,\nit\u2019s that reality is such that Caesar\u2019s crossing the\nRubicon was future, and was present, and is\nnow past.\n\nMcTaggart responds by restating this response in terms of second-order\nA-properties. To say that Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon\nwas future, and was present, and is now\npast is to say that it has the properties of being past\nfuture (i.e. having been future), past present (i.e.\nhaving been present) and present past (i.e. now being past).\nAnd similar reasoning to the above suggests that every time and event\nhas each of the nine possible second-order A-properties; and while\nit\u2019s not the case that any two of them are incompatible, certain\npairs of them are. Nothing can be both past past and\nfuture future, for example: if \\(E\\) has been a mere past\nevent, it can\u2019t be true that \\(E\\) will be something that is yet\nto happen. And yet the complete account of reality seems to include\nboth Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon being past past and its being\nfuture future. After all, in 2000 BCE Caesar\u2019s crossing the\nRubicon was future future, since 1000 BCE was the future and\nCaesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon would still be the future then.\nAnd Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon is past past just now, since\n1000 CE is past, and Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon was past\nthen. But both 2000 BCE and the present are part of the overall\nhistory of the world, so the goings on at each time are part of what\nthe world as a whole is like, and so Caesar\u2019s crossing the\nRubicon is both past past and future future, and yet those are\nincompatible. And again, the defender of the A-series will respond\nthat it\u2019s not that Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon\nis both past past and future future, it\u2019s that it is\nnow past past and was future future. And McTaggart\nwill respond that this is to invoke third-order\nA-properties\u2014being present past past, being past\nfuture future, etc. And the same problem will arise, and invite\nthe same response, which will lead to the same problem concerning\nfourth-order A-properties, which will invite the same response again\n\u2026 and so on, ad infinitum.\n\nWhether McTaggart\u2019s regress is vicious has proven a subject of\nmuch debate. Some philosophers see the regress as demonstrating that\nany attempt to describe the world in A-theoretic terms is ultimately\ninconsistent, and see the A-theorist as merely invoking another\ninconsistent account of reality every time they attempt to explain\naway this inconsistency. Mellor, for example, says (1998, 75)\n\u201c[McTaggart\u2019s] critics react by denying the viciousness of\nthe regress. At every stage, they say, we can remove the apparent\ncontradiction by distinguishing the times at which the events have\nincompatible [A-properties]. They ignore the fact that the way they\ndistinguish these times \u2026 only generates more\ncontradictions.\u201d Others see McTaggart as simply making a\nconfused challenge at each stage\u2014as mistakenly concluding from\nthe fact that things were one way and are now\nanother incompatible way that they are both ways at\nonce\u2014and continuing to make the same mistake in response to each\nof the A-theorist\u2019s correct explanations that in fact the\nincompatible properties are only ever had one after another, never at\nthe same time. Skow (2015, 87), e.g., says \u201cAt each stage\n[McTaggart] accuses objective becoming [i.e. things changing their\nA-properties] of being inconsistent, and [the A-theorist] shows that\nallegation to be false. And even an infinite sequence of false\nallegations does not add up to a good argument.\u201d\n\nThis is arguably another case where whether or not the regress is\nvicious by a philosopher\u2019s lights will depend on their\nbackground theoretical commitments. If one starts out happy with the\nnotion of succession\u2014i.e. of one thing being the case\nand then ceasing to be the case as something else comes\nto be the case\u2014then one may be inclined to see\nMcTaggart\u2019s regress as entirely benign. We start out with a set\nof incompatible properties that are never had by anything\nsimultaneously but are held by things successively; in stating that\nthose properties are had successively we make salient a new set of\nincompatible properties, but these are also never had by anything\nsimultaneously, only successively; this makes salient yet another set\nof incompatible properties, and so on ad infinitum. There is\nnever, at any stage, a contradiction, if the notion of succession is\nindeed in good standing, for we are never forced to say that a thing\nhas incompatible properties, only that a thing successively has\nproperties that cannot be had simultaneously. If, by contrast, one is\nsuspicious of the very notion of succession\u2014if one sees\nin it simply an attempt to paper over what is ultimately a\ncontradiction inherent in the commitment to reality being each of two\nincompatible ways, the way it supposedly is now and the way it\nsupposedly was or will be\u2014then one will see in McTaggart\u2019s\nregress an infinite sequence of contradictory accounts of how reality\nis, with each attempt at explaining away the contradiction simply\nresulting in another such contradictory account. The regress, then,\nlooks vicious or benign depending on whether one is content to grant\nthe legitimacy of the notion of temporal succession.\n",
