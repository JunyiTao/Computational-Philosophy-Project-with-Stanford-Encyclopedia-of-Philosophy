    "main_text": "Three Primary Eschatological Views || Restricting the Scope of God\u2019s Love\n1.2 Restricting the Scope of God\u2019s Love\n\nWe have seen so far that the Augustinians in effect reason as follows:\nGod\u2019s saving grace is irresistible in the end, and yet\neverlasting torment in hell will nonetheless be the terrible fate for\nsome; therefore, God does not love all created persons equally and his\n(electing) love is thus limited in its scope. Augustine\u2019s own\ninterpretation of 1 Timothy 2:4 provides a nice illustration. He\nwrote: \u201cthe word concerning God, \u2018who will have all men to\nbe saved,\u2019 does not mean that there is no one whose salvation he\n[God] doth not will \u2026 but by \u2018all men\u2019 we are to\nunderstand the whole of mankind, in every single group into which it\ncan be divided \u2026 For from which of these groups doth not God\nwill that some men from every nation should be saved through\nhis only-begotten Son our Lord?\u201d (Enchiridion,\n103\u2014italics added).\n\nSo it is not God\u2019s will, Augustine claimed, to save every\nindividual from every group and every nation; it is merely God\u2019s\nwill to save all kinds of people, that is, some individuals\nfrom every group and every nation. Augustine\u2019s exegetical\narguments for such an interpretation, however fantastic they may\nappear to non-Augustinians, need not concern us here. More important\nfor our purposes is his pattern of argument, as illustrated in the\nfollowing comment: \u201cWe could interpret it [1 Tim. 2:4] in any\nother fashion, as long as we are not compelled to believe that the\nOmnipotent hath willed something to be done which was not\ndone\u201d\u2014and as long as we are not compelled to believe, he\nno doubt took for granted, that no one will be eternally damned. For\nif propositions (2) and (3) are both true, then proposition\n(1) is false and the scope of God\u2019s love is restricted to a\nlimited elect. It is as simple as that.\n\nNor should one suppose that this Augustinian understanding of limited\nelection is totally bereft of contemporary defenders. One such\ncontemporary defender, the Christian philosopher Paul Helm, has argued\nthat God\u2019s loving nature no more necessitates that God extend a\nredemptive love equally to all humans than it necessitates that God\ncreate them all with the same human characteristics. For why is it,\nHelm asks, \u201cthat some are strong, some weak, some male, some\nfemale, some healthy, some diseased, and so forth?\u201d He then\nmakes the following claim: \u201cif it is possible for there to be\ndifferentiations in the created universe that are consistent with the\nattributes of God then it is presumably possible for there to be\ndifferentiations with regard to God\u2019s redemptive purposes which\nare entirely consistent with the divine attributes\u201d (Helm 1985,\n53). How one evaluates such a claim will no doubt depend, at least in\npart, upon how one answers such questions as these: Would God\u2019s\nwilling that one person have black hair and another brown hair be\ncompatible with loving both of them equally and with acting justly\ntoward both of them? Would God\u2019s willing that one person should\ncome to a glorious end and another to a horrific end be compatible\nwith loving both of them equally and with acting justly toward both of\nthem?\n\nIn response to similar questions, Jeff Jordan has challenged the whole\nidea, which he acknowledges to be widely accepted among theistic\nphilosophers, that \u201cGod\u2019s love must be maximally extended\nand equally intense\u201d (Jordan 2012, 53). According to Jordan,\nsuch maximally extended love would be a deficiency in any human who\nmanifested it; hence, it should not be numbered among God\u2019s\nperfections or great-making properties. Neither is it possible, he\nappears to argue, that God should love equally each and every created\nperson. For \u201cif God has deep attachments [with some of them], it\nfollows that he does not love all [of them] equally. And being a\nperfect being, God would have loves of the deepest kind\u201d (Jordan\n2012, 67). Jordan thus asks in a later article, \u201cWhat if ... it\nis not possible in-principle [even for God] to love every person\nuniformly to the same degree?\u201d And in support of his contention\nthat this is indeed impossible, Jordan argues, first, that people in\nfact have incompatible interests, second, that two \u201cinterests\nare incompatible just in case attempts to bring about one of them\nrequire that the other be impeded,\u201d and third, that love of the\ndeepest kind \u201chas as a necessary constituent identifying with\nthe interests of one\u2019s beloved\u201d (Jordan 2015, 184). \n\nTwo critical problems arise at this point. First, why suppose that the\ndeepest love for others (in the sense of willing the very best for\nthem) always requires identifying with their own interests? According\nto Jordan, a person\u2019s interest is merely \u201ca desire or goal\nhad by that person\u2014something that a person cares about\u201d\n(Jordan 2012, 62, n. 26; see also Jordan 2020, 83). But in that sense\nof \u201cinterest,\u201d God\u2019s deepest love for a person\nsurely requires that God actually oppose or impede some of that\nperson\u2019s interests. Why else would Christians believe, as the\nauthor of Hebrews put it, that God often \u201cdisciplines those whom\nhe loves and chastises every child whom he accepts\u201d? (Heb.\n12:6). And second, why suppose that God cannot identify with\nincompatible interests anyway? Indeed, why cannot a single individual\nidentify with incompatible interests (or conflicting desires) of his\nor her own? Jordan himself offers the following explanation of what it\nmeans to identify with an interest: \u201cIdentifying with an\ninterest we might understand as, roughly, caring about what\none\u2019s beloved cares about because one\u2019s beloved cares\nabout it\u201d (Jordan 2015, 184). But why, then, cannot a loving\nmother, for example, care deeply about the incompatible interests (or\nimmediate desires) of her two small children as they squabble over a\ntoy and care about these incompatible interests, however trivial they\nmight otherwise have seemed to her, precisely because her beloved\nchildren care about them? The impossibility of her satisfying\nsuch incompatible interests hardly entails the impossibility of her\nidentifying with them in the sense of caring deeply about\n them.[2]\n Accordingly, what a proponent of limited election needs at this point\nis to specify a clear sense of \u201cto identify with\u201d such\nthat (a) it is impossible for God to identify with incompatible\ninterests and (b) an equally deep love for all created persons would\nnonetheless require that God be able to identify with at least some of\ntheir incompatible interests. \n\nIn any case, the vast majority of Christian philosophers who have\naddressed the topic of hell in recent decades and have\npublished at least some of their work in the standard philosophical\njournals do accept proposition (1) and also reject, therefore, any\nhint of Augustinian limited election. However ephemeral and changeable\nsuch a consensus may be, the contemporary consensus does seem to be\nthat God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all humans equally (see,\nfor example, Buckareff and Plug 2005, Knight 1997, Kronen and Reitan\n2011, Kvanvig 1993, Murray 1998, Seymour 2000b, Stump 1983, Swinburne\n1983, and Walls 1998). For a more thorough examination and critique of\nJordan\u2019s specific arguments, see Parker 2013, and Talbott 2020;\nand for Jordan\u2019s reply to some of this criticism, see Jordan\n2015 and Jordan 2020, Ch. 5.\n",
