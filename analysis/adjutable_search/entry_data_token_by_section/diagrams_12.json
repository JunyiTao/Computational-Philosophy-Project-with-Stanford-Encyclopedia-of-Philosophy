The\nco-exact conditions realized by a diagram \u2018are those\nconditions which are unaffected by some range of every continuous\nvariation of a specified diagram.\u2019 Exact conditions, in\ncontrast, are affected once the diagram is subject to the smallest\nvariation. Roughly, a diagram\u2019s co-exact properties comprise the\nways its parts define a finite set of planar regions, and the\ncontainment relations between these regions. A prominent exact\nrelation is the equality of two magnitudes within a diagram. For\nexample, only the slightest change to the position of CF in the\ndiagram for proposition 16 is required to make the angles BAE and ECF\nunequal.\n\nManders\u2019 key observation is that Euclid\u2019s diagrams\ncontribute to proofs only through their co-exact properties.\nEuclid never infers an exact property from a diagram unless it follows\ndirectly from a co-exact property. Relations between magnitudes which\nare not exhibited as a containment are either assumed from the outset\nor are proved via a chain of inferences in the text. This can easily\nbe confirmed with the proof of proposition 16. The one inference that\nrelies on the diagram is the second to last inference of the proof.\nThe inference, specifically, is that angle ACD is greater than angle\nACF. This, crucially, is based on seeing from the diagram that angle\nACD contains angle ACF. There are many other relations\nasserted to hold in the proof. Though the diagram instantiates them,\nthey are explicitly justified in the text. And with these relations,\nthe relata are spatially separated magnitudes. \n\nIt is not difficult to hypothesize why Euclid would have restricted\nhimself in such a way. It is only in their capacity to represent\nco-exact properties and relations that diagrams seem capable of\nfunctioning effectively as symbols of proof. The exact properties of\ndiagrams are too refined to be easily reproducible and to support\ndeterminate judgments. As Manders puts it\n\n\nThe practice has resources to limit the risk of disagreement on\n(explicit) co-exact attributions from a diagram; but it lacks such\nresources for exact attributions, and therefore could not allow them\nwithout dissolving into a disarray of irresolvably conflicting\njudgements. (Manders\n 2008 [1995]:\n 91\u201392)\n\n\nManders\u2019 insights lead naturally to the idea that Euclid\u2019s\narguments could be formalized in a manner similar to the way Venn\ndiagrams have been formalized in Shin\n 1994.\n The co-exact information carried by Euclid\u2019s diagrams is\ndiscrete. When a diagram is consulted for this information, what\nmatters about it is how its lines and circles partition a bounded\nplanar region into a finite set of sub-regions. This opens the door to\nconceptualizing Euclid\u2019s diagrams as part of the syntax\nof Euclid\u2019s proof method. \n4.2.2 The generality problem with Euclid\u2019s constructions\n\nRealizing this conception in a formal system of proof amounts, as in\nShin\n 1994,\n to specifying the syntax and semantics of diagrams. On the syntactic\nside, this means defining Euclid\u2019s diagrams as formal objects\nprecisely, and giving rules whereby diagrams as formal object figure\nin derivations of Euclid\u2019s propositions. On the semantic side,\nthis means specifying how derivable expressions are to be interpreted\ngeometrically, or in other words how exactly are they to be understood\nas representing Euclid\u2019s propositions.\n\nThe semantic situation with Euclid\u2019s diagrams is thus different\nfrom that with Venn\u2019s. Venn diagrams are used to prove\nlogical results. The inferences made with them are topic\nneutral. Euclid\u2019s diagrams on the other hand are used to prove\ngeometrical results. The inferences made with them are topic\nspecific. In particular, though the objects of plane Euclidean\ngeometry are abstract (e.g., geometric lines are breadthless), they\nare still spatial. Consequently, issues surrounding the spatiality of\ndiagrams and representational scope do not arise with Euclid\u2019s\ndiagrams as they do, for instance, with Euler diagrams. In the case of\ngeometry, in fact, the spatiality of diagrams counts in their favor.\nSpatial constraints on what is possible with geometric configurations\nare also operative with spatial Euclidean diagrams.\n\nNevertheless, as recognized in the philosophical commentary on\nEuclid\u2019s geometry from antiquity onward, there are with\nEuclidean diagrams issues of representational scope to contend with.\nWhat is the justification for treating properties of a single\ngeometric diagram as representative of all the configurations in the\nrange of a proof? How can a single diagram prove a general result?\nManders\u2019 exact/co-exact distinction provides the basis for a\npartial answer. The co-exact properties of a diagram can be shared by\nall geometric configurations in the range of a proof, and so in such\ncases one is justified in reading off co-exact properties from the\ndiagram. In a proof about triangles for instance, variation among the\nconfigurations in the range of the proof is variation of exact\nproperties\u2014e.g., the measure of the triangles\u2019 angles, the\nratios between their sides. They all share the same co-exact\nproperties\u2014i.e., they all consists of three bounded linear\nregions which together define an area.\n\nThis is not a full answer because Euclid\u2019s proofs typically\ninvolve constructions on an initial configuration type. With the proof\nof proposition 16, for example, a construction on a triangle with one\nside extended is specified. In such cases, a diagram may adequately\nrepresent the co-exact properties of an initial configuration. But the\nresult of applying a proof\u2019s construction to the diagram cannot\nbe assumed to represent the co-exact properties of all configurations\nresulting from the construction. One does not need to consider complex\ngeometric situations to see this. Suppose for instance the initial\nconfiguration type of a proof is triangle. Then the\ndiagram\n\n\n\n\nserves to represent the co-exact properties of this type. Suppose\nfurther that the first step of a proof\u2019s construction is to drop\nthe perpendicular from a vertex of the triangle to the line containing\nthe side opposite the vertex. Then the result of carrying this step\nout on the diagram\n\n\n\n\nceases to be representative. That the perpendicular falls within the\ntriangle in the diagram is a co-exact feature of it. But there are\ntriangles with exact properties different from the initial diagram\nwhere applying the construction step results in a perpendicular lying\noutside the triangle. For example, with the triangle\n\n\n\n\nthe result of applying the construction step is\n\n\n\n\n4.3 The formal systems FG and Eu\n\nAnd so, carrying out a Euclidean construction on a representative\ndiagram can result in an unrepresentative diagram. A central task of\nformalizing Euclid\u2019s diagrammatic proofs is accounting for\nthis\u2014i.e., providing with its rules a method for distinguishing\ngeneral co-exact features from non-general ones in diagrammatic\nrepresentations of constructions. The systems FG and\nEu take two different approaches to this task. \n\nEmploying the method of FG, one must produce with a\ndiagram every case that could result from the construction. A\ngeneral co-exact relation of the construction is then one that appears\nin every case. FG\u2019s demand that every case be\nproduced would, of course, be of a little interest if it did not also\nprovide a method for producing them all. The method\nFG provides depends on the fact that lines and\ncircles in the system\u2019s diagrams are defined in purely\ntopological terms. Their resulting flexibility makes it possible to\nformulate and implement in a computer program a general method for\ngenerating\n cases.[9]\n\n\nThe lines and circles of Eu diagrams are not\nsimilarly flexible. Accordingly, it cannot resolve the generality\nproblem via case-analysis as FG does. The central\nidea of its approach is to allow diagrams to hold partial information\nfrom the outset. Within an Eu derivation, the diagram\nproduced by a proof\u2019s construction has an initial content\nconsisting in all the qualitative relations of the proof\u2019s\ninitial diagram. The qualitative relations concerning objects added by\nthe construction cannot be read off the diagram immediately. Those\nthat can be read off the diagram must be derived by the system\u2019s\n rules.[10]\n\nThe differences between the FG and\nEu approaches to formalizing Euclid\u2019s\nconstructions can be understood as representing different general\nconceptions of the role of diagrams in mathematics.\nFG embodies a conception where diagrams concretely\nrealize a range of mathematical possibilities. They support\nmathematical inference by furnishing direct access to these\npossibilities. Eu in contrast embodies a conception\nwhere diagrams serve to represent in a single symbol the various\ncomponents of a complex mathematical situation. They support\nmathematical inference by allowing the mathematical reasoner to\nconsider all these components in one place, and to focus on those\ncomponents relevant to a proof.\n5. Diagrams and Cognition, Applications\n\nDespite the formal limitations of some diagrammatic systems noted\nabove, many different systems are currently used in a wide variety of\ncontexts; logic teaching, automated reasoning, specifying computer\nprograms, reasoning about situations in physics, graphical user\ninterfaces to computer programs, and so on. In general, it is not yet\nknown how effective (in the above sense) many of these diagrammatic\nsystems are. We now give a brief survey of other diagrammatic systems\nand their uses, as well as the more philosophical issues raised by the\ndebate over the status of diagrammatic reasoning. \n5.1 Some other Diagrammatic Systems\n\nIt is worth noting that many mathematicians and philosophers proposed\ndiagrammatic systems, often with a didactic motivation. Some systems,\nlike Lewis Carroll\u2019s in \u201cThe Game of Logic\u201d\n (1896)\n are variants on the proposals of Euler and Venn. Others, like Frege\n (1879),\n used lines rather than plane regions. (For a description of\nFrege\u2019s notation, see the section on Complex Statements and\nGenerality in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.\n See also Englebretsen\n 1992.)\n Carroll\u2019s system supersedes Venn\u2019s in that the\ncomplements of sets are explicitly represented as regions of the\ndiagram, rather than being left as the background region against which\nthe circles appear. This means that Carroll\u2019s system is able to\ndraw inferences about relations between complements of properties, at\nthe expense of representing some properties as disjoint (i.e.,\nnon-connected) regions. This shift closely mirrors the shift in logic\nfrom subject-predicate argumentation to a function-argument\nrepresentation (Stenning\n 1999).\n\nPeirce, a founder of modern quantified logic, also invented a\ngraphical system, called Existential Graphs, which is logically\nequivalent to predicate logic. Along with Don Robert\u2019s\npioneering work on Existential Graphs and John Sowa\u2019s creative\napplication of Peirce\u2019s graphs, recently a group of diagrammatic\nresearchers provided more diverse approaches to Existential Graphs in\na broader theoretical context (Shin\n 2003).\n \n\nOn a more practical theme, AI researchers, one of whose main concerns\nis the heuristic power of representation systems in addition to their\nexpressive power, have been debating about different forms of\nrepresentation for decades (Sloman\n 1971,\n 1985,\n 1995).\n Hence, they have welcomed discussions of the distinct role of visual\nreasoning and have recently hosted interdisciplinary symposiums on\ndiagrammatic reasoning at AI\n conferences.[11]\n At the same time, realizing that human beings adopt different\nrepresentation forms depending on the kinds of problems they face,\nsome AI researchers and design theorists have practiced\ndomain-specific approaches to bringing in problem-tailored\nrepresentation\n forms.[12]\n\nFor instance, Harel\n (1988)\n invented higraphs to represent system specifications in computer\nscience. This idea has been taken up in industrial applications (e.g.,\nUML, in Booch et al.\n 1998).\n Barker-Plummer & Bailin\n (1997)\n present a case study in developing computers which can carry out the\nkind of analogical reasoning that humans perform when proving certain\nmathematical theorems. More recently, an interesting result has been\npresented by Mateja Jamnik of Alan Bundy\u2019s Mathematical\nReasoning Group at Edinburgh (Jamnik\n 2001).\n Jamnik shows how a semi-automatic formal proof system can perform\nsome of the perceptual inferences which humans find so natural. For\ninstance, that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is\nn squared is easily seen by decomposing an n\n\u00d7 n grid into\n\u201cells\u201d (Jamnik et al.\n 1999).\n\nScholars at the University of Brighton has been carrying out\ninteresting projects both in developing diagrammatic systems and in\napplying visual tools in software development, see the link in the\n Other Internet Resources section.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that scientists such as chemists and\nphysicists also use diagrams in order to perform certain computations.\nFeynman diagrams, for example, are used to perform calculations in\nsub-atomic physics. More recently, formal diagrammatic reasoning has\nbeen developed for quantum theory (Coecke & Kissinger\n 2017).\n In Knot Theory (which has applications in physics, Kauffman\n 1991)\n the three Reidemeister Moves are diagrammatic operations which make\nup a complete calculus for proving knots equivalent. Not surprisingly,\nKnot diagrams have attracted interest from researchers (De Toffoli\n& Giardino\n 2014).\n The crucial role of diagrams and diagrammatic reasoning in the\nabstract mathematics of category theory has also been investigated\n(Halimi\n 2012;\n De Toffoli\n 2017).\n \n5.2 Diagrams as Mental Representations\n\nDo our mental representations have diagram-like or picture-like\nentities as components? This question has a long history both in\nphilosophy and in psychology, independently of each other. More\nrecently, however, some philosophers have participated in this\n\u201cimagery debate\u201d, one of the most time-honored\ncontroversies in psychology, and some cognitive psychologists find\ncertain epistemological theories in philosophy useful to support their\nviews on the issue.\n\nThe nature of mental representation has been one of the perennial\ntopics in philosophy, and we can easily trace back philosophical\ndiscussions on images and mental representation to ancient\n times.[13]\n The writings of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume concern themselves\nin large part with mental discourse, the meaning of words, mental\nimages, particular ideas, abstract ideas, impressions, and so on.\nDescartes\u2019 well-known distinction between imagining and\nconceiving something has generated much discussion about the unique\nrole of visual images in mental representations. The development of\ncognitive science in the 20th century naturally has brought certain\ngroup of philosophers and psychologists closer and we find a number of\nauthors whose works easily belong to both disciplines (Block\n 1983;\n Dennett\n 1981;\n Fodor\n 1981).\n\nImagery based on introspection was the main focus in the early\ndevelopment of psychology until the behavioristic approach became\npredominant in the discipline. During the era of behaviorism, anything\nrelated to mental inspection, including images, was excluded from any\nserious research agenda. Finally when the topic of mental images made\na comeback in psychology in 1960s, researchers adopted a more humble\nagenda for mental imagery than before: Not all mental representations\ninvolve imagery, and imagery is one of many ways of manipulating\ninformation in the mind. Also, thanks to the influence of behaviorism,\nit is acknowledged that introspection is not enough to explore\nimagery, but a claim about mental imagery needs to be confirmable by\nexperiments in order to show that we successfully externalize mental\nevents. That is, if what a certain mental introspection tells us is\ngenuine, then there would be observable external consequences of that\nmental state.\n\nThus the contemporary imagery debate among cognitive scientists is\nabout the claim that picture-like images exist as mental\nrepresentations and about how we interpret certain\n experiments.[14]\n\nKosslyn\n (1980,\n 1994) and other pictorialists (Shepard & Metzler\n 1971)\n present experimental data to support their position that some of our\nmental images are more like pictures than a linear form of language\n(for example, natural languages or artificial symbolic languages) in\nsome important aspects, even though not all visual mental images and\npictures are of exactly the same kind. By contrast, Pylyshyn\n (1981)\n and other descriptionalists (Dennett\n 1981)\n raise questions about the picture-like status of mental images and\nargue that mental images are formed out of structured descriptions. To\nthem, mental images represent in the manner of language rather than\npictures and, hence, there are no picture-like visual mental\nimages.\n\nBoth sides of the debate sometimes used a philosophical theory as a\nsupporting factor. For example, pictorialists in the imagery debate\nfound the modern sense-datum theory in philosophy quite close to their\npoint of view. By the same token, the critics of the sense-datum\ntheory argued that the mistaken pictorial view of mental images arises\nmainly from our confusion about ordinary language and claimed that\nmental images are epiphenomena.\n5.3 The Cognitive Role of Diagrams\n\nWithout being heavily involved in the imagery debate, some researchers\nhave focused on a distinct role that diagrams or pictures\u2014as\nopposed to traditional sentential forms\u2014play in our cognitive\nactivities. (Shin\n 2015;\n Hamami & J. Mumma\n 2013)\n Based on the conjectures that humans adopt diagrammatic or spatial\ninternal mental representations in their reasoning about concrete or\nabstract situations (see Howell\n 1976;\n Sober\n 1976),\n some cognitive scientists have concentrated on the functions of\nimages or diagrams in our various cognitive activities, for example,\nmemory, imagination, perception, navigation, inference,\nproblem-solving, and so on. Here, the distinct nature of \u201cvisual\ninformation,\u201d which is obtained either through internal mental\nimages or through externally drawn diagrams, has become a major topic\nof research. Even though most of these works assume that there are\nmental images (that is, they accept the pictorialists\u2019 claim),\nstrictly speaking they do not have to commit themselves to the view\nthat these images exist as basic units in our cognition.\nDescriptionalists do not have to discard discussions of the functions\nof images, but only need to add that these images are not primitive\nunits stored in our memory, but formed out of structured descriptions\nmore like the sentences of a language (see Pylyshyn\n 1981).\n\nA search for the distinct role of diagrams has led researchers to\nexplore the differences among different forms of external or internal\nrepresentations, and mainly between diagrammatic and sentential\nrepresentations. Many important results have been produced in\ncognitive science. Starting from Larkin and Simon\u2019s classic case\nstudy\n (1987)\n to illustrate a difference between informational and computational\nequivalence among representation systems, Lindsay\u2019s work locates\nwhere this computational difference lies, which he calls a\n\u2018non-deductive\u2019 method. As briefly pointed out above, this\ninference process is called \u2018free ride\u2019 by Barwise and\nShimojiima\n (1995),\n i.e., the kind of an inference in which the conclusion seems to be\nread off automatically from the representation of premises. In Gurr,\nLee, and Stenning\n (1998)\n and Stenning and Lemon\n (2001),\n there is an explanation of the uniqueness of diagrammatic inference\nin terms of a degree of \u2018directness\u2019 of interpretation,\nand it is argued that this property is relative, and hence that\n\u201csome rides are cheaper than others\u201d. Having the role of\ngraphs in mind, Wang and Lee\n (1993)\n present a formal framework as a guideline for correct visual\nlanguages. At this point, we are very close to applied aspects of\nresearch in multi-modal reasoning\u2014design theory and AI\nresearch\u2014by providing these disciplines with computational\nsupport for visual reasoning.\n\nRelated to the issue of imagistic mental representation is the\nexamination of the semantics of various diagrammatic systems and what\nthey can teach us about the nature of languages in general (e.g.,\nGoodman\n 1968).\n For instance, Robert Cummins\n (1996),\n amongst others, argues that too little attention has been given to\ndiagrammatic representations and that focus on a notion of\n\u201cstructural representation\u201d more akin to diagrammatic\nrepresentation can help to explicate the nature of representation\nitself. We believe that the considerations presented above give us\nsome empirical handle on this type of claim at least\u2014depending\non the imagistic objects and relations used, patterns of incorrect\ninference should be predictable and detectable. An important, if\nlittle-known, article on this theme is Malinas\n 1991.\n Here Malinas explores the concepts of pictorial representation and\n\u201ctruth in\u201d a picture via the notion of resemblance, and\nconsiders various semantic puzzles about pictorial representation. He\ndevelops Peacocke\u2019s \u201cCentral Thesis\u201d of depiction\n(Peacocke\n 1987),\n where experienced similarities between properties of pictorial\nobjects and their referents in the visual field give rise to the\nrelation of depiction. He goes on to provide a formal semantics for\npictures which is \u201canalogous to a semantics for an ideal\nlanguage\u201d.\nSummary\n\nWe began by motivating the philosophical interest of diagrams, by way\nof their role in human reasoning and their relation to the study of\nlanguage in general, and multi-modal information processing. We then\nexplained the trade-off between expressive power and visual clarity of\ndiagrammatic systems, by examining the historical development of\ndiagram systems from Euler and Venn, through Peirce\u2019s work, to\nrecent work by Shin and Hammer. It was argued that diagrammatic\nsystems can be afforded the same logical status as traditional linear\nproof calculi. We then explained some of the potential pitfalls of\ndiagrammatic representation and reasoning, by examining spatial\nconstraints on diagrammatic systems and how they can affect\ncorrectness and expressive power. We closed by surveying other\ndiagrams systems, the interest in diagrams generated in computer\nscience and cognitive science, and gave an introduction to the imagery\ndebate in the philosophy of mind.
