    "main_text": "The Innate Knowledge Thesis\n3. The Innate Knowledge Thesis\n\nThe Innate Knowledge thesis asserts that we have a priori\nknowledge, that is knowledge independent, for its justification, of\nsense experience, as part of our rational nature. Experience may\ntrigger our awareness of this knowledge, but it does not provide us\nwith it. The knowledge is already there.\n\nPlato presents an early version of the Innate Knowledge thesis in the\nMeno as the doctrine of knowledge by recollection. The\ndoctrine is motivated in part by a paradox that arises when we attempt\nto explain the nature of inquiry. How do we gain knowledge of a\ntheorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by\ninquiry seems impossible (Meno, 80d-e). We either already\nknow the theorem at the start of our investigation or we do not. If we\nalready have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack\nthe knowledge, we don\u2019t know what we are seeking and cannot\nrecognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of\nthe theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems.\n\nThe doctrine of knowledge by recollection offers a solution. When we\ninquire into the truth of a theorem, we both do and do not already\nknow it. We have knowledge in the form of a memory gained from our\nsoul\u2019s knowledge of the theorem prior to its union with our\nbody. We also lack some knowledge because, in our soul\u2019s\nunification with the body, it has forgotten the knowledge and now\nneeds to recollect it. Thus, learning the theorem allows us, in\neffect, to recall what we already know.\n\nPlato famously illustrates the doctrine with an exchange between\nSocrates and a young slave, in which Socrates guides the slave from\nignorance to mathematical knowledge. The slave\u2019s experiences, in\nthe form of Socrates\u2019 questions and illustrations, are the\noccasion for his recollection of what he learned previously.\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics provides additional support for the Innate\nKnowledge Thesis. Since our knowledge is of abstract, eternal Forms,\nwhich clearly lie beyond our sensory experience, it is independent,\nfor its justification, of experience.\n\nContemporary supporters of Plato\u2019s position are scarce. The\ninitial paradox, which Plato describes as a \u201ctrick\nargument\u201d (Meno, 80e), rings sophistical. The\nmetaphysical assumptions in the solution need justification. The\nsolution does not answer the basic question: Just how did the\nslave\u2019s soul learn the theorem? The Intuition/Deduction thesis\noffers an equally, if not more, plausible account of how the slave\ngains this type of knowledge that is independent of experience.\nNonetheless, Plato\u2019s position illustrates the kind of reasoning\nthat has caused many philosophers to adopt some form of the Innate\nKnowledge thesis. We are confident that we know certain propositions\nabout the external world, but there seems to be no adequate\nexplanation of how we gained this knowledge short of saying that it is\ninnate. Its content is beyond what we directly gain in experience, as\nwell as what we can gain by performing mental operations on what\nexperience provides. It does not seem to be based on an intuition or\ndeduction. That it is innate in us appears to be the best\nexplanation.\n\nNoam Chomsky argues along similar lines in presenting what he\ndescribes as a \u201crationalist conception of the nature of\nlanguage\u201d (1975, p. 129). Chomsky argues that the experiences\navailable to language learners are far too sparse to account for their\nknowledge of their language. To explain language acquisition, we must\nassume that learners have an innate knowledge of a universal grammar\ncapturing the common deep structure of natural languages. It is\nimportant to note that Chomsky\u2019s language learners do not know\nparticular propositions describing a universal grammar. They have a\nset of innate capacities or dispositions which enable and determine\ntheir language development. Chomsky gives us a theory of innate\nlearning capacities or structures rather than a theory of innate\nknowledge. His view does not support the Innate Knowledge thesis as\nrationalists have traditionally understood it. As one commentator puts\nit, \u201cChomsky\u2019s principles \u2026 are innate neither in\nthe sense that we are explicitly aware of them, nor in the sense that\nwe have a disposition to recognize their truth as obvious under\nappropriate circumstances. And hence it is by no means clear that\nChomsky is correct in seeing his theory as following the traditional\nrationalist account of the acquisition of knowledge\u201d (Cottingham\n1984, p. 124). Indeed, such a theory, which places nativism at the\nlevel of mental capacities or structures enabling us to acquire\ncertain types of knowledge rather than at the level of knowledge we\nalready posses, is akin to an empiricist take on the issue. Locke and\nReid, for instance, believe that the human mind is endowed with\ncertain abilities that, when developed in the usual course of nature,\nwill lead us to acquire useful knowledge of the external world. The\nmain idea is that it is part of our biology to have a digestive system\nthat, when fed the right kind of food, allows us to process the\nrequired nutrients to enable us to continue to live for a while.\nSimilarly, it is part of our biology to have a mental architecture\nthat, when fed the right kind of information and experiences, allows\nus to process that information and transform it into knowledge. The\nknowledge itself is no more innate than the processed nutrients are.\nOn a view like this, no knowledge is innate; however, we are born with\ncertain capabilities and disposition that enable us to acquire\nknowledge, just as we are equipped with certain organs that allow our\nbodies to function well while we\u2019re alive.\n\nPeter Carruthers (1992) argues that we have innate knowledge of the\nprinciples of folk-psychology. Folk-psychology is a network of\ncommon-sense generalizations that hold independently of context or\nculture and concern the relationships of mental states to one another,\nto the environment and states of the body and to behavior (1992, p.\n115). It includes such beliefs as that pains tend to be caused by\ninjury, that pains tend to prevent us from concentrating on tasks, and\nthat perceptions are generally caused by the appropriate state of the\nenvironment. Carruthers notes the complexity of folk-psychology, along\nwith its success in explaining our behavior and the fact that its\nexplanations appeal to such unobservables as beliefs, desires,\nfeelings, and thoughts. He argues that the complexity, universality,\nand depth of folk-psychological principles outstrips what experience\ncan provide, especially to young children who by their fifth year\nalready know a great many of them. This knowledge is also not the\nresult of intuition or deduction; folk-psychological generalizations\nare not seen to be true in an act of intellectual insight. Carruthers\nconcludes, \u201c[The problem] concerning the child\u2019s\nacquisition of psychological generalizations cannot be solved, unless\nwe suppose that much of folk-psychology is already innate, triggered\nlocally by the child\u2019s experience of itself and others, rather\nthan learned\u201d (1992, p. 121).\n\nEmpiricists, and some rationalists, attack the Innate Knowledge thesis\nin two main ways. First, they offer accounts of how sense experience\nor intuition and deduction provide the knowledge that is claimed to be\ninnate. Second, they directly criticize the Innate Knowledge thesis\nitself. The classic statement of this second line of attack is\npresented in Locke\u2019s Essay. Locke raises the issue of\njust what innate knowledge is. Particular instances of knowledge are\nsupposed to be in our minds as part of our rational make-up, but how\nare they \u201cin our minds\u201d? If the implication is that we all\nconsciously have this knowledge, it is plainly false. Propositions\noften given as examples of innate knowledge, even such plausible\ncandidates as the principle that the same thing cannot both be and not\nbe, are not consciously accepted by children and those with severe\ncognitive limitations. If the point of calling such principles\n\u201cinnate\u201d is not to imply that they are or have been\nconsciously accepted by all rational beings, then it is hard to see\nwhat the point is. \u201cNo proposition can be said to be in the\nmind, which it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious\nof\u201d (Essay, 1.2.5). Proponents of innate knowledge\nmight respond that some knowledge is innate in that we have the\ncapacity to have it. That claim, while true, is of little interest,\nhowever. \u201cIf the capacity of knowing, be the natural impression\ncontended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know, will, by this\naccount, be every one of them, innate; and this great point will\namount to no more, but only an improper way of speaking; which whilst\nit pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing different from those,\nwho deny innate principles. For nobody, I think, ever denied, that the\nmind was capable of knowing several truths\u201d (Essay,\n1.2.5). Locke thus challenges defenders of the Innate Knowledge thesis\nto present an account of innate knowledge that allows their position\nto be both true and interesting. A narrow interpretation of innateness\nfaces counterexamples of rational individuals who do not meet its\nconditions. A generous interpretation implies that all our knowledge,\neven that clearly provided by experience, is innate.\n\nDefenders of innate knowledge take up Locke\u2019s challenge. Leibniz\nresponds in New Essays by appealing to an account of\ninnateness in terms of natural potential to avoid Locke\u2019s\ndilemma. Consider Peter Carruthers\u2019 similar reply.\n\nWe have noted that while one form of nativism claims (somewhat\nimplausibly) that knowledge is innate in the sense of being present as\nsuch (or at least in propositional form) from birth, it might also be\nmaintained that knowledge is innate in the sense of being innately\ndetermined to make its appearance at some stage in childhood. This\nlatter thesis is surely the most plausible version of nativism. (1992,\np. 51)\n\n\nCarruthers claims that our innate knowledge is determined through\nevolutionary selection (p. 111). Evolution has resulted in our being\ndetermined to know certain things (e.g. principles of folk-psychology)\nat particular stages of our life, as part of our natural development.\nExperiences provide the occasion for our consciously believing the\nknown propositions but not the basis for our knowledge of them (p.\n52). Carruthers thus has a ready reply to Locke\u2019s\ncounterexamples of children and cognitively limited persons who do not\nbelieve propositions claimed to be instances of innate knowledge. The\nformer have not yet reached the proper stage of development; the\nlatter are persons in whom natural development has broken down (pp.\n49\u201350).\n\nA serious problem for the Innate Knowledge thesis remains, however. We\nknow a proposition only if it is true, we believe it and our belief is\nwarranted. Rationalists who assert the existence of innate knowledge\nare not just claiming that, as a matter of human evolution,\nGod\u2019s design or some other factor, at a particular point in our\ndevelopment, certain sorts of experiences trigger our belief in\nparticular propositions in a way that does not involve our learning\nthem from the experiences. Their claim is even bolder: In at least\nsome of these cases, our empirically triggered, but not empirically\nwarranted, belief is nonetheless warranted and so known. How can these\nbeliefs be warranted if they do not gain their warrant from the\nexperiences that cause us to have them or from intuition and\ndeduction?\n\nSome rationalists think that a reliabilist account of warrant provides\nthe answer. According to Reliabilism, beliefs are warranted if they\nare formed by a process that generally produces true beliefs rather\nthan false ones. The true beliefs that constitute our innate knowledge\nare warranted, then, because they are formed as the result of a\nreliable belief-forming process. Carruthers maintains that\n\u201cInnate beliefs will count as known provided that the process\nthrough which they come to be innate is a reliable one (provided, that\nis, that the process tends to generate beliefs that are true)\u201d\n(1992, p. 77). He argues that natural selection results in the\nformation of some beliefs and is a truth-reliable process.\n\nAn appeal to Reliabilism, or a similar causal theory of warrant, may\nwell be the best way to develop the Innate Knowledge thesis. Even so,\nsome difficulties remain. First, reliabilist accounts of warrant are\nthemselves quite controversial. Second, rationalists must give an\naccount of innate knowledge that maintains and explains the\ndistinction between innate knowledge and non-innate knowledge, and it\nis not clear that they will be able to do so within such an account of\nwarrant. Suppose for the sake of argument that we have innate\nknowledge of some proposition, P. What makes our knowledge\nthat P innate? To sharpen the question, what difference\nbetween our knowledge that P and a clear case of non-innate\nknowledge, say our knowledge that something is red based on our\ncurrent visual experience of a red table, makes the former innate and\nthe latter not innate? In each case, we have a true, warranted belief.\nIn each case, presumably, our belief gains its warrant from the fact\nthat it meets a particular causal condition, e.g., it is produced by a\nreliable process. In each case, the causal process is one in which an\nexperience causes us to believe the proposition at hand (that\nP; that something is red), for, as defenders of innate\nknowledge admit, our belief that P is \u201ctriggered\u201d\nby an experience, as is our belief that something is red. The insight\nbehind the Innate Knowledge thesis seems to be that the difference\nbetween our innate and non-innate knowledge lies in the relation\nbetween our experience and our belief in each case. The experience\nthat causes our belief that P does not \u201ccontain\u201d\nthe information that P, while our visual experience of a red\ntable does \u201ccontain\u201d the information that something is\nred. Yet, exactly what is the nature of this containment relation\nbetween our experiences, on the one hand, and what we believe, on the\nother, that is missing in the one case but present in the other? The\nnature of the experience-belief relation seems quite similar in each.\nThe causal relation between the experience that triggers our belief\nthat P and our belief that P is contingent, as is\nthe fact that the belief-forming process is reliable. The same is true\nof our experience of a red table and our belief that something is red.\nThe causal relation between the experience and our belief is again\ncontingent. We might have been so constructed that the experience we\ndescribe as \u201cbeing appeared to redly\u201d caused us to\nbelieve, not that something is red, but that something is hot. The\nprocess that takes us from the experience to our belief is also only\ncontingently reliable. Moreover, if our experience of a red table\n\u201ccontains\u201d the information that something is red, then\nthat fact, not the existence of a reliable belief-forming process\nbetween the two, should be the reason why the experience warrants our\nbelief. By appealing to Reliabilism, or some other causal theory of\nwarrant, rationalists may obtain a way to explain how innate knowledge\ncan be warranted. They still need to show how their explanation\nsupports an account of the difference between innate knowledge and\nnon-innate knowledge. So, Locke's criticism -- that there is no true\ndistinction between innate versus non-innate knowledge that\nrationalists may draw -- still stands, in the face of the best\nrationalist defense of the Innate Knowledge thesis.\n",
