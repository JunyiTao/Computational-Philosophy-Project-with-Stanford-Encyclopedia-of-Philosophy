    "main_text": "Criticism || Statistical analysis\n6.1 Statistical analysis\n\n\nConsider the following example of a social-scientific debate: During\nthe 1990s, there was a precipitous decline in violent crime in the\nUnited States. Many social scientists naturally began to apply\nthemselves to the question of why this had occurred, i.e., they set\nout to explain the phenomenon. A number of different hypotheses were\nadvanced: the hiring of more police, changes in community policing\npractices, more severe sentencing guidelines for offenders, decreased\ntolerance for minor infractions, an increase in religiosity, a decline\nin the popularity of crack, changes in the demographic profile of the\npopulation, etc. Since the decline in crime occurred in many different\njurisdictions, each using some different combination of strategies\nunder different circumstances, it is possible to build support for\ndifferent hypotheses through purely statistical analysis. For example,\nthe idea that policing strategies play an important role is\ncontradicted by the fact that New York City and San Francisco adopted\nvery different approaches to policing, and yet experienced a similar\ndecline in the crime rate. Thus a very sophisticated debate broke out,\nwith different social scientists producing different data sets, and\ncrunching the numbers in different ways, in support of their rival\nhypotheses.\n\n\nThis debate, like almost every debate in criminology, lacks\nmicrofoundations. It would certainly be nice to know what is going\nthrough people\u2019s mind when they commit crimes, and thus how likely\nvarious measures are to change their behavior, but the fact is we do\nnot know. Indeed, there is considerable skepticism among\ncriminologists that a \u201cgeneral theory\u201d of crime is\npossible. Nevertheless, we can easily imagine criminologists deciding\nthat one particular factor, such as a demographic shift in the\npopulation (i.e., fewer young men), is the explanation for\nthe late-20th century decline in violent crime in the\nUnited States, and ruling out the other hypotheses. And even though\nthis may be a \u201chalf-way\u201d explanation, there is no question\nthat it would represent a genuine discovery, one that we could learn\nsomething important from.\n\n\nFurthermore, it is not obvious that the \u201crock-bottom\u201d\nexplanation \u2013 the one that satisfies the precepts of\nmethodological individualism \u2013 is going to add anything very\ninteresting to the \u201chalf-way\u201d explanation provided by the\nstatistical analysis. In many cases it will even be derived from\nit. Suppose that we discovered, through statistical analysis, that the\ncrime rate varied as a function of the severity of punishment\nmultiplied by the probability of apprehension. We would then infer\nfrom this that criminals were rational utility-maximizers. On the\nother hand, if studies showed that crime rates were completely\nunaffected by changes in the severity of punishments or the\nprobability of apprehension, we would infer that something else must\nbe going on at the action-theoretic level.\n\n\nResults at the action-theoretic level might also prove to be random or\nuninteresting, from the standpoint of the explanatory\nvariables. Suppose it turns out that the decline in crime can be\nexplained entirely by demographic change. Then it doesn\u2019t really\nmatter what the criminals were thinking \u2013 what matters is simply\nthat a certain percentage of any given demographic group has the\nthoughts that lead to criminal behavior, so fewer of those people\ntranslates into less crime. The motives remain inside the \u201cblack\nbox\u201d \u2013 and while it might to nice to know what those\nmotives are, they may not contribute anything to this particular\nexplanation. In the end, it may turn out that each crime is as unique\nas the criminal. So while there is a concrete explanation in terms of\nactual people\u2019s intentional states, there is nothing that can be said\nat the level of a general \u201cmodel\u201d of rational action.  (In\nthis context, it is important to remember that methodological\nindividualism in the Weberian sense explains actions in terms of a\nmodel of the agent, not the actual motivations of the real\npeople.)\n",
