    "main_text": "Political Liberty as Non-Domination || Liberty as Non-Domination\n1.2 Liberty as Non-Domination\n\nBy way of illustration, consider the following scenarios (both are\nstandard examples in the republican tradition). In the first, imagine\na group of slaves with a generally well-meaning master. While the\nlatter has an institutionally-protected right to treat his slaves more\nor less as he pleases (he might start whipping them just for the heck\nof it, say), let us suppose that this master in particular leaves his\nslaves for the most part alone. Now to the extent that he does not in\nfact interfere with his slaves on a day-to-day basis, we are committed\nto saying\u2014on the non-interference view of liberty\u2014that\nthey enjoy some measure of freedom. Some find this conclusion deeply\ncounterintuitive: if there is anything to the idea of political\nliberty, one might think, surely it cannot be found in the condition\nof slavery!\n\nEven if we are willing to accept this conclusion, the non-interference\nview of liberty commits us to others that are perhaps even more\nparadoxical. For one thing, notice that we are committed to saying\nthat the slaves of our well-meaning master enjoy greater\nfreedom than the slaves of an abusive master down the road. Of course,\nthe former slaves are better off in some respect than the latter, but\ndo we really want to say that they are more free? For\nanother, consider the slave who, over time, comes to understand his\nmaster\u2019s psychological dispositions better and better. Taking\nadvantage of this improved insight, he manages to keep on his\nmaster\u2019s good side, and is consequently interfered with less and\nless. Thus, on the non-interference view of liberty, we are committed\nto saying that his freedom is increasing over time. Again, while it is\nclear that the slave\u2019s greater psychological insight improves\nhis well-being in some respect, do we really want to say that it\nincreases his freedom specifically?\n\nNow consider a second scenario. Imagine the colony of a great imperial\npower. Suppose that the colonial subjects have no political rights,\nand thus that the imperial power governs them unilaterally. But\nfurther suppose that the imperial power, for one reason or another,\nchooses not to exercise the full measure of its authority\u2014that\nits policy towards the colony is one of more or less benign neglect.\nFrom the point of view of liberty as non-interference, we must\nconclude that the colonial subjects enjoy considerable freedom with\nrespect to their government for, on a day-to-day basis, their\ngovernment hardly ever interferes with them. Next suppose that the\ncolonial subjects revolt with success, and achieve political\nindependence. The former colony is now self-governing. We may imagine,\nhowever, that the new government is somewhat more active than its\nimperial predecessor, passing laws and instituting policies that\ninterfere with people\u2019s lives to a greater extent than formerly\nwas the case. On the view of liberty as non-interference, we must\ntherefore say that there has been a decline in freedom with\nindependence. As in the first scenario, many find this\ncounterintuitive. Surely, a nation that has secured its independence\nfrom colonial rule must have increased its political\nliberty.\n\nWhat these examples are driving at is that political liberty might\nbest be understood as a sort of structural relationship that exists\nbetween persons or groups, rather than as a contingent pattern on\noutcomes. Whether a master chooses to whip his slave on any given day,\nwe might say, is a contingent outcome: it all depends on the\nmaster\u2019s mood, the slave\u2019s behavior, and so forth. What is\nnot contingent (or at least not in the same way) is the broader\nconfiguration of laws, institutions, and norms that effectively permit\nmasters to treat their slaves however they please. As the ex-slave\nFrederick Douglass said of his former condition, \u201cit was\nslavery\u2014not its mere incidents\u2014that I hated\u201d (1855,\n161).\n\nThe republican conception of political liberty aims to capture this\ninsight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of\nstructural independence\u2014as the condition of not being subject to\nthe arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master. Pettit, who has done\nmore than anyone else to develop this republican conception of freedom\nphilosophically, puts it thus: a person or group enjoys freedom to the\nextent that no other person or group has \u201cthe capacity to\ninterfere in their affairs on an arbitrary basis\u201d (1999, 165;\ncf. Pettit\u00a01997, 2001, 2012, 2014). On a plausible rendering of\nthe term \u2018domination\u2019 as, roughly speaking, arbitrary or\nuncontrolled power (see Wartenberg 1990; Pettit\u00a01997, 2012;\nLovett\u00a02010, 2018), we might equivalently say that freedom in the\nrepublican sense consists in the secure enjoyment of non-domination.\nThis view has since been widely embraced by republican-minded authors\nsuch as Skinner (1998, 2002, 2008), Viroli (2002), Maynor (2003,\n2015), Laborde (2008, 2010), Costa (2009, 2013, 2016), Honohan (2013,\n2014), Taylor (2017), and O\u2019Shea (2019).\n",
