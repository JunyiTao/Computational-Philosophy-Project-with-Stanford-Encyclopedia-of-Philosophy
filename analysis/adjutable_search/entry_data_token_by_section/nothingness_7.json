    "main_text": "Ontological neutrality\n8. Ontological neutrality\n\nAristotle assumes that universal generalizations have existential\nimport; \u2018All gods are immortal\u2019 implies that there are\ngods. Contemporary logicians agree that universal quantifiers have\nexistential import: pantheism, \u2018All is god\u2019, entails\ntheism, \u2018There is a god\u2019 . However, contemporary logicians\ndiffer from Aristotle in analyzing universal generalizations as\nconditionals. They think \u2018All gods are immortal\u2019 has the\nform \u2018For each thing, if it is a god, then it is\nimmortal\u2019. So if there are no gods, the conditional is vacuously\ntrue. This explains why the atheist can consistently argue: All gods\nare immortal. Immortality is impossible. Therefore, there are no\ngods.\n\nContemporary logicians are also impressed by the intuitive equivalence\nbetween \u2018All men are mortal\u2019 and its contrapositive\n\u2018All immortals are non-men\u2019. This equivalence is predicted\nby the hypothesis that universal generalizations are conditionals.\n\nTolerance of vacuously true generalizations does not stop contemporary\nclassical logic from precluding an empty world. Since its universal\nquantifier has existential import, each of its logical laws imply that\nsomething exists. For instance, the principle of identity,\nEverything is identical to itself entails There exists\nsomething that is identical to itself. Many attractive inferences\nare jeopardized by the empty world.\n\nLogicians do not treat their intolerance of the empty world as a\nresource for metaphysicians. They do not want to get involved in\nmetaphysical disputes. They feel that logic should be neutral with\nrespect to the existence of anything. They yearn to rectify this\n\u201cdefect in logical purity\u201d (Russell 1919, 203).\n\nThe ideal of ontological neutrality has led some philosophers to\nreject classical logic. A direct response would be to challenge the\nexistential import of the classical quantifiers.\n\nProponents of \u201cfree logic\u201d prefer to challenge the\nexistential presupposition of singular terms (Lambert 2003, 124). In\nclassical logic, names must have bearers. Free logic lacks this\nrestriction and so countenances empty names as in \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes is a detective\u2019 and negative existentials such as\n\u2018Pegasus does not exist\u2019. Proponents of free logic suggest\nthat these departures are a necessary condition for not trivially\nimplying an existential proposition. Jan Heylen (2017) agrees but\ncontends that free logic trivially implies other existential\nsentences. He concludes that any deductive answer to the question will\nbeg the question. The background logic will always intrude.\n\nIn any case, the changes recommended by free logicians would certainly\nundermine W. V. O. Quine\u2019s (1953a) popular criterion for\nontological commitment. Quine says that we can read off our ontology\nfrom the existentially quantified statements constituting our\nwell-accepted theories. For instance, if evolutionary theory says that\nthere are some species that evolved from other species, and if we have\nno way to paraphrase away this claim, then biologists are committed to\nthe existence of species. Since philosophers cannot improve on the\ncredentials of a scientific commitment, metaphysicians would also be\nobliged to accept species.\n\nSo how does Quine defend his criterion of ontological commitment from\nthe menace looming from the empty domain? By compromise. Normally one\nthinks of a logical theorem as a proposition that holds in all\ndomains. Quine (1953b, 162) suggests that we weaken the requirement to\nthat of holding in all non-empty domains. In the rare circumstances in\nwhich the empty universe must be considered, there is an easy way of\ntesting which theorems will apply: count all the universal\nquantifications as true, and all the existential quantifications as\nfalse, and then compute for the remaining theorems.\n\nIs Quine being ad hoc? Maybe. But exceptions are common for\nnotions in the same family as the empty domain. For instance,\ninstructors halt their students\u2019 natural pattern of thinking\nabout division to forestall the disaster that accrues from permitting\ndivision by zero. If numbers were words, zero would be an irregular\nverb.\n",
