    "main_text": "Underlying Ideas\n1. Underlying Ideas\n\nReflection on the concept of an object has its first theoretical\narticulation in Aristotle\u2019s Categories, where he\ndistinguishes between individual objects and the various kinds of\nproperties they can possess. He illustrates the various\ncategories:\n\neach [individual term] signifies either substance or quantity or\nqualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or\nhaving or doing or being affected. To give a rough idea, ideas of\nsubstance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of\nqualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half,\nlarger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when:\nyesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of\nhaving: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of\nbeing-affected: being-cut, being-burnt. (1b25\u20132a4)\n\n\nThe individual substances are the subjects of properties in the\nvarious other categories, and they can gain and lose such properties\nwhilst themselves enduring. There is an important distinction pointed\nout by Aristotle between individual objects and\nkinds of individual objects. Thus, for some purposes,\ndiscussion of substance is a discussion about individuals, and for\nother purposes it is a discussion about universal concepts that\ndesignate specific kinds of such individuals. In the\nCategories, this distinction is marked by the terms\n\u2018primary substance\u2019 and \u2018secondary substance\u2019.\nThus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but\ndog or doghood is the secondary substance or\nsubstantial kind. Each arm of this distinction raises\ndifferent issues. If one is concerned with kinds of\nsubstance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what\nmakes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in\nbeing a dog)?\u2019 This is the question of the essence of\nsubstantial kinds. But if one is concerned with individuals, the\nparallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular\nindividual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a\ndog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?\u2019 This is the question of\nindividual essences and of identity over time. Aristotle was mainly,\nif not exclusively, concerned with questions of the first kind, but,\nas we shall see in\n section 2.5.2\n and\n section 3,\n the latter question assumed a prominence later.\n\nThis association of substance with kinds carries\nover into a use of the term, which is perhaps more scientific,\nespecially chemical, than philosophical. This is the conception\naccording to which substances are kinds of stuff. They are\nnot individual objects nor kinds of individual\nobject. Examples of this usage are water,\nhydrogen, copper, granite or\nectoplasm.\n\nThere is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected\nin the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or\neven permanence. Events, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are\nnever substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting. Atoms,\nfundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as\nPlatonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to\nthe point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as\nlong as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or\nabstract entities, perhaps longer.\n\nIt seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas\nthat contribute to the philosophical concept of substance. Substances\nare typified as:\n\nbeing ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from\nwhich everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically\nsustained;\nbeing, at least compared to other things, relatively independent\nand durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so;\nbeing the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of\nproperties;\nbeing, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the\nsubjects of change;\nbeing typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or\nkinds of objects;\nbeing typified by kinds of stuff.\n\n\nWe shall see later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of\nsubstance:\n\nsubstances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our\nspatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification\nof which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework. (It should\nbe remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle\n(Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar\nintention to Aristotle himself.)\n\n\nIn\n section 3.5\n we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account,\nbut which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion,\nnamely the connection between substance and teleology. This can be\nexpressed as:\n\nThe substances in a given system are those entities crucial from\nthe teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucial\u2019 means that other things exist either to\nconstitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\n\n\nDifferent philosophers emphasise different criteria from amongst this\nlist, for reasons connected with their system as a whole. One could\nplausibly say that an account is intuitively more appealing, the more\nof the criteria it can find a place for. Probably, the Aristotelian\ntradition comes nearest to doing this.\n",
