    "main_text": "What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies || Barrier Between Traits and What is Transmitted to the Next Generation\n6.1 Barrier Between Traits and What is Transmitted to the Next Generation\n\nTo the extent that the DNA transmitted to the next generation has been\nshielded from most of the interactions that occur during the\norganism\u2019s lifetime (both within the organism and with the\nenvironment), there is a barrier to \u201cpeculiar\u201d traits\n(Johannsen\u2019s label for traits acquired during the specific\ndevelopment of the parents) being passed on to their offspring. (A key\npart of this shielding is the one-way transcription of DNA to RNA\n[which then codes for the amino acids that make up proteins], not, in\ngeneral, transcription in the other direction.) While the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction can be seen to signify the\nexistence of this barrier, there is a long history of researchers\nclaiming to show ways around it. Most notably, the modern science of\nepigenetics, building on ever-increasing information about DNA\nsequences and how genes function, shows how chemicals from outside the\ncell can modify the activity of genes for the rest of an\norganism\u2019s life and sometimes even into subsequent generations\n(Stotz 2006). \n\nDevelopmental Systems Theory (Oyama, Griffiths, & Gray 2001),\nEvolutionary developmental biology (\u201cevo-devo\u201d) (Moczek et\nal. 2015), and a Post-genomic Synthesis in Behavior and Cognition\nResearch (Stotz 2008) also argue for attention to extended\ninheritance, which includes transmission not only of epigenetic\nmodifications, but also of resources outside the organism, such as\nwhen reptiles lay their eggs in places that ensure the right\ntemperature for incubation. This last example also fits under the\nambit of Niche Construction theory (Odling-Smee et al. 2003). This\nfield investigates the significance of organisms shaping the\necological context in which they develop their traits, survive, and\nreproduce, as epitomized by beavers living in the ecosystem of ponds\nformed by the dams that they build and maintain. (Whether or not\nepigenetic and extra-organismal resources have the same causal status\nas genes is a matter of philosophical debate beyond the scope of this\nentry; see Waters 2007; Stotz 2006; Griffiths & Stotz 2013; entry\non\n inheritance systems,\n and\n section 7\n below.)\n",
