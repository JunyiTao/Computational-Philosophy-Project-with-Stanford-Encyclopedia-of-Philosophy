It is maintained in the earliest\nknown treatise on insolubles (De Rijk 1966) and in one other early\nanonymous text (Spade 1975: 43\u201344), but seems to have died out\nafter about 1225, although it continued to be mentioned in later\nauthors\u2019 surveys of previous views, no doubt because of its\ninclusion in Bradwardine\u2019s own survey. It was briefly revived by\nJohn Dumbleton in the 1340s: see\n  Section 3.6\n and Spade 1975 item XXXVI, pp. 63\u20135). His essential idea was\nthat signification requires uptake, so any utterance which cannot be\nunderstood cannot constitute a proposition\u2014and the insolubles\ndefy understanding, for self-reference generates a regress of deferred\nintelligibility.\n\n\u2018Cassation\u2019 is now an archaic word (though it survives in\nlegal documents and other languages), but merely means \u201cmaking\nnull and void, canceling\u201d. In effect, this theory holds that one\nwho utters an insoluble proposition \u201cisn\u2019t saying\nanything\u201d. The second of the texts just cited even gives a\ncurious \u201cordinary language\u201d argument, appealing to the\nrusticus (the man-in-the-street), who, if you were to say to\nhim \u201cWhat I am saying is false\u201d, would reply\n\u201cNil dicis\u201d (\u201cYou are saying\nnothing\u201d).\n\nThe treatise in De Rijk 1966 presents more of a theory. Much of it is\nobscure to modern scholars, but it seems to appeal to a distinction\nbetween a mental act of asserting and a vocal act of uttering a\nproposition. \u201cSaying\u201d requires both acts; it is \u201can\nassertion with utterance\u201d. In the case of the liar who says\n\u201cWhat I am saying is false\u201d, the mental act of asserting\nis present, and for that matter so is the physical act of uttering the\nwords. But somehow (this is the obscure part) there is no\n\u201csaying\u201d.\n\nIt is tempting to interpret this view as an appeal to a kind of\nfallacy of composition; just as someone who is both good and an author\nis not necessarily a good author, so too something that is both\nmentally asserted and vocally uttered is not necessarily\n\u201csaid\u201d (asserted with utterance). It is tempting, yes, but\nhighly speculative. Nevertheless, whatever the correct interpretation,\nit appears that the distinction between asserting and uttering drawn\nby this theory escapes the facile \u201crefutation\u201d of it used\nas early as the mid-thirteenth century, that it \u201cplainly\ncontradicts sensation that is not\n deceived\u201d.[18]\n",
