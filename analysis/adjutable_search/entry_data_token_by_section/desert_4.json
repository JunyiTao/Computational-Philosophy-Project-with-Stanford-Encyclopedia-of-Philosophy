    "main_text": "Desert and Intrinsic Value\n5. Desertist Theories of Justice\n\nThere is a long tradition according to which justice is fundamentally\na matter of receipt in accord with desert. There are passages in the\nwritings of Aristotle, Leibniz, Mill, Sidgwick, Ross and others in\nwhich this idea seems to be\n present.[4]\n The abstract desertist idea can be combined with different views\nabout what people deserve and the bases upon which they deserve these\nthings; for each combination of these views about deserts and desert\nbases, there is a different version of the desertist theory of\njustice. One of the broadest of these may be called \u201cUniversal\nDesertism about Justice.\u201d It is the idea that justice obtains\nwhen people receive everything they deserve on any basis. Although\nMill did not accept this conception of justice, he claimed that\nsomething quite like it is very widely accepted by \u201cthe general\nmind.\u201d Mill said: \n\nIt is universally considered just that each person should obtain that\n(whether good or evil) which he deserves; and unjust that he\nshould obtain a good, or be made to undergo an evil, which he does not\ndeserve. This is, perhaps, the clearest and most emphatic form in\nwhich the idea of justice is conceived by the general mind\n(Utilitarianism, ch 5, para\n 7).[5]\n\n\nWhen combined with natural and popular assumptions about what people\ndeserve, Universal Desertism gives an account of a form of justice\nthat probably would not be of much interest to social and political\nphilosophers. For given these assumptions about what people deserve,\nthe view implies that in order for there to be perfect justice in a\nsociety, every student would have to get every grade that he or she\ndeserves, and every athlete would have to win every competition that\nhe or she deserves to win, every neighbor would have to receive every\napology and thank-you note that he or she deserves, and everyone would\nhave to receive the amount of respect, and admiration, and love, and\ncontempt, and good luck that he or she deserves. The society would be\na veritable wonderland of requited desert in which no one would have\nany grounds for complaint about being short-changed about anything.\nSurely, however, when political philosophers are drawn to the idea\nthat justice is a matter of receipt in accord with desert, they do not\nhave anything quite so fantastic in mind. \n\nLeibniz maintained a desertist theory of justice that makes use of\nconsiderably restricted views about the relevant desert and desert\nbases. He described what he called \u2018the law of justice\u2019 in\nthese words: \n\n\u2026 everyone is to participate in the perfection of the universe,\nand to have personal happiness, in proportion to his own virtue and to\nthe extent that his will has contributed to the common good. (Leibniz\n1697)\n\n\nLeibniz evidently was imagining a view according to which there is\nonly one main currency of justice (\u2018happiness and participation\nin the perfection of the universe\u2019), and only one main desert\nbase (\u2018virtue and the extent to which his will has contributed\nto the common good\u2019) whose magnitude determines the amount of\nthe desert he deserves. Leibniz suggested that it falls to God to\nensure that people receive these deserts in the afterlife. \n\nWe can say that \u201cDivine Moral Desertism\u201d is the view that\njustice obtains when everyone receives from God in the afterlife\nprecisely the level of happiness or unhappiness that he or she\ndeserves on the basis of his or her level of moral virtue or vice\nduring life.\n\nClearly it is possible for there to be a situation in which the level\nof justice as measured by Universal Desertism is very low, but the\nlevel of justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism is very high.\nThis would happen if people rarely received the prizes and awards and\nincome and other things that they deserve here on earth, but if in\naddition they always received their heavenly rewards from God in the\nafterlife. \n\nIt is also possible for there to be a situation in which the level of\njustice as measured by Universal Desertism is very high, but the level\nof justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism is very low. This\nwould happen if people often received the apologies, thank-you notes,\nwages, grades, honorific jobs, etc. that they deserve on earth, but if\nin addition they never received any heavenly or infernal rewards in an\nafterlife for the virtue or vice that they manifested while they\nlived. \n\nWhile Divine Moral Desertism might be of interest to some theologians\nor philosophers of religion, it is doubtful that any social or\npolitical philosopher would have any professional interest in it.\nSocial and political philosophers are more interested in\nearthly justice \u2013 the kind of justice that obtains in\nvirtue of things that governments are called upon to do for their\ncitizens here on earth. But Divine Moral Desertism concerns things\nthat God does; and benefits or burdens to be received in the\nafterlife, rather than on earth. \n\nA historically important form of desertism emerges if we continue to\nmaintain that the relevant desert bases are all manifestations of\nmoral virtue and vice, but we introduce different assumptions about\ndeserts and distributors. Instead of saying (with Leibniz) that the\nrelevant deserts are levels of happiness and unhappiness to be\nexperienced in heaven or hell, we can say that the relevant deserts\nare levels of happiness and unhappiness to be experienced here on\nearth, during our lives. Furthermore, instead of saying that the\ndistributor from whom we deserve to receive these rewards is God, we\ncan say that we deserve them from our country. The result is a form of\ndesertism according to which there is perfect justice in a country if\nand only if in every case in which a citizen of that country deserves\nto be at a certain level of happiness or unhappiness in virtue of\nhaving lived at a certain level of moral virtue or vice, the\ngovernment of his or her country sees to it that the person comes to\nbe at that level of happiness during his or her lifetime. We can call\nthis \u201cEarthly Moral Desertism about Justice.\u201d \n\nIt should be obvious that justice as measured by Earthly Moral\nDesertism is not equivalent to justice as measured by Divine Moral\nDesertism. \n\nIn several passages in A Theory of Justice John Rawls attacks\nwhat he takes to be the desertist conception of justice. In these\npassages, Rawls seems to have in mind something quite like Earthly\nMoral Desertism. He mentions what he takes to be the motto of\ndesertism: \u2018justice is happiness according to virtue\u2019\n(1971, 310). Some of his objections to desertism turn on difficulties\nthat governments would face if they were to try to ensure a proper fit\nbetween citizens\u2019 levels of virtue and happiness. This indicates\nthat Rawls was imagining (and trying to refute) a form of desertism\nthat would saddle the government with the task of matching happiness\nlevels to virtue levels. \n\nA more plausible form of earthly desertism might attempt to assess\nstates or communities for the way in which economic items such as\nmoney, jobs, and taxes, and political items such as political rights\nand opportunities and obligations are distributed. The imagined form\nof desertism could purport to give an account of the circumstances\nunder which these things have been distributed justly even though it\nis silent on the distribution of other very important things such as\nhappiness, or victories in sporting events, or warm loving\nrelationships or apologies. \n\nInstead of focusing on all the things that anyone could deserve, or\nupon just one thing \u2013 happiness \u2013 such a theory could\nfocus on what we may call \u2018political economic deserts.\u2019\nThese might include such things as political rights and obligations,\nother benefits and burdens we get from our countries, security of\ncertain sorts, access to publicly owned or regulated infrastructure\nsuch as transportation systems, educational systems, judicial systems,\ncommunication systems, etc. \n\nInstead of focusing on all the desert bases in virtue of which anyone\ncould deserve anything, or simply upon the single desert base of moral\nvirtue, a theory of political economic justice could focus on what we\nmay call \u2018political economic desert bases.\u2019 These might\ninclude such things as being a citizen; having been unjustifiably\nharmed by a government agency; having earned a lot of money; being\nkeen on getting into business; being vulnerable to robbers and muggers\nwho might attack. The theory could thus focus on desert bases such\nthat it is the business of a government to take note of the fact that\nits citizens manifest these bases, and it is the business of that\ngovernment to try to see to it that its citizens receive the things\nthat they deserve on these bases. \n\nFurthermore, the imagined theory could focus on what we may call our\n\u2018political economic distributors.\u2019 In the typical case,\nthe political economic distributor for a certain person is the\ngovernment of that person\u2019s country, or suitable representatives\nof that government. The resulting theory, which we may dub\n\u2018Political Economic Desertism about Justice,\u2019 then could\nmaintain that there is perfect political economic distributive justice\nin a country if and only if in every case in which a citizen of that\ncountry deserves a political economic desert in virtue of having a\npolitical economic desert base, the government of his or her country\nensures that he or she receives that desert. \n\nIt should be clear that there might be perfect justice as measured by\nPolitical Economic Desertism in some country even though some citizens\nof that country fail to get some of the things they deserve. Maybe the\ncitizens are getting everything they deserve from their country, but\nsome fail to receive the apologies that they deserve from their\nspouses and children, and others fail to receive the good luck in\nsports or romance that they deserve. Indeed, there could be perfect\njustice as measured by Political Economic Desertism in every country\nin some possible world even though many residents of that world fail\nto receive lots of things that they deserve. \n\nIt should also be clear that there is no interesting connection\nbetween justice as measured by Divine Moral Desertism and justice as\nmeasured by this Political Economic Desertism. We can easily imagine a\nsituation in which people receive all the political economic deserts\nthat they deserve from their governments, but never receive any of the\nheavenly rewards they deserve in the afterlife. \n\nSuppose the government in some country steadfastly keeps out of the\nbusiness of tracking the levels of virtue in its citizens. Suppose\nthis government also steadfastly keeps out of the business of worrying\nabout how happy its citizens are. But suppose in addition that the\ngovernment scrupulously distributes income tax refunds, in-state\ntuition waivers, voting rights, police protection, and other such\nthings to citizens who deserve to have them. Then the level of justice\nas measured by Earthly Moral Desertism in that country could be very\nlow, but the level of justice as measured by Political Economic\nDesertism would be very high. So these are clearly distinct concepts\nof justice. \n\nIn recent work, after explicating his concept of desert, T. M. Scanlon\npresents an extended argument designed to show \u201cnot just that\nthe particular conception of desert that [he has] examined \u2026\nplays no role in distributive justice. It is rather that initially\nplausible claims that individuals deserve certain economic benefits\nturn out, on closer examination, either to be invalid or to reduce to\nclaims of justice of some other identifiable sort\u201d (see Scanlon\n2013, 2018). Scanlon\u2019s claim seems to be that no fundamentally\ndesertist theory of distributive justice is correct. \n\nIn an effort to explicate the notion of desert that he has in mind,\nScanlon points out some principles concerning it that he means to\nendorse. First he distinguishes between desert and entitlement and\nreminds the reader that the mere fact that someone is entitled to a\ncertain form of treatment by the rules of some institution is not\nsufficient by itself to show that he or she deserves that treatment.\nThis would be evident in cases in which the entitlement-generating\ninstitution is itself seriously unjust. Next, Scanlon reminds the\nreader that the fact that some treatment would have good consequences\nis not, in itself, a basis for saying that the person deserves that\ntreatment. Scanlon also accepts the notion that there is a distinction\nbetween basic and derived desert. If a person deserves a form of\ntreatment, then this desert must be related to a more fundamental form\nof desert involving reactive attitudes. The deserved treatment must be\na standard way of expressing the deeper fact that the person deserves\nthe attitude. In general, Scanlon accepts the idea that if a person\ndeserves some treatment, the basis on which he or she deserves it must\ninvolve his or her own behavior or character. In virtue of the fact\nthat Scanlon endorses all these familiar doctrines about desert, it\nseems fair to say that his concept of desert is entirely within the\nmainstream.\n\nScanlon sketches several proposed desert bases by appeal to which a\ndesertist might attempt to explain why justice requires that citizens\nreceive economic benefits from their countries. These include (a)\nbeing morally meritorious, (b) having expended effort in productive\nlabor, (c) having made some other socially valuable contribution, and\n(d) being in possession of some special talent. In each case, Scanlon\nclaims either that the alleged factor is not a desert base at all, or\nelse that appeal to it cannot explain why certain people deserve\ngreater economic benefits from their countries. \n\nThe central problem that Scanlon emphasizes is that, as he sees it,\ndesertist theories of justice cannot explain how it can be just for\ndifferent citizens to receive different-sized benefits from their\ncountries. In this context, he hints at a two-level view according to\nwhich citizens may be entitled to different-sized benefits by the\nrules and regulations of some distributive institution that has been\nestablished in their country. Scanlon seems to acknowledge that if the\ninstitution itself is just, the citizens will deserve the\ndifferent-sized benefits to which they are entitled. But he emphasizes\nthat this desert of differential benefits will arise only if the\ninstitution that authorizes them is itself somehow justified. Scanlon\nsuggests that such institutions may be justified, and so the scheme as\na whole may be on the right track, but he seems to claim that the\njustification of the institution would then have to appeal to some\njustifying feature other than desert. And so, as he sees it, the\nscheme as a whole would not be a desertist theory of distributive\njustice.\n\nHowever, a defender of a desertist theory of political economic\ndistributive justice like the one sketched earlier might claim, in\nreply, that the distributional system itself might be justified in\nvirtue of the fact that citizens deserve to live in a country where\nsuch a system is in place. Perhaps it could be argued that citizens\ndeserve this because they need it in order to flourish as human\nbeings, and no individual human being is capable of establishing such\na distributional system on his or her own. If this is right, it would\napparently follow that the theory as a whole is a desertist theory of\ndistributive justice. It remains to be seen whether Scanlon\u2019s\nobjections to desertist theories of justice ultimately succeed, or\nwhether a desertist theory of the sort sketched may in the end prove\nto be acceptable.\n",
