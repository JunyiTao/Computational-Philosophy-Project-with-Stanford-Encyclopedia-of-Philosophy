    "main_text": "\n\nPrincipia Mathematica [PM] by A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand\nRussell, published 1910\u20131913 in three volumes by Cambridge\nUniversity Press, contains a derivation of large portions of\nmathematics using notions and principles of symbolic logic. The\nnotation in that work has been superseded by the subsequent\ndevelopment of logic during the 20th century, to the extent\nthat the beginner has trouble reading PM at all. This article provides\nan introduction to the symbolism of PM, showing how that symbolism can\nbe translated into a more contemporary notation using concepts which\nshould be familiar to anyone who has had a first course in symbolic\nlogic or set theory. This translation is offered as an aid to learning\nthe original notation, which itself is a subject of scholarly dispute,\nand embodies substantive logical doctrines so that it cannot simply be\nreplaced by contemporary symbolism. Learning the notation, then, is a\nfirst step to learning the distinctive logical doctrines of\nPrincipia Mathematica. \n",
