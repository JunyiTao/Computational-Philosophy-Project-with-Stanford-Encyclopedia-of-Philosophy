    "main_text": "The Epiphenomenalism Objections || Mental Properties and Explanatory Relevance\n6.1 Mental Properties and Explanatory Relevance\n\nCritics of this extensionalist line of defense insisted that related\nquestions remained about Anomalous Monism even taking into account the\ndistinction between causation and explanation. In particular, they\nquestioned whether mental properties could play any genuine\nexplanatory role\u2014whether they had explanatory\nrelevance\u2014given the priority assigned to physical\nproperties in Davidson\u2019s framework. Why think that mental\nproperties explain anything given that the events which instantiate\nthem always also instantiate physical properties that figure in causal\nlaws? One thought here is that genuine explanations require laws, and\nmental anomalism, in ruling out psychological and psychophysical laws,\ncannot account for any explanatory role for mental properties vis a\nvis physical or mental events.\n\nIn response, Davidson notes that while Anomalous Monism rejects the\npossibility of strict laws in which mental predicates can figure, it\nallows for ceteris paribus psychological and psychophysical\nlaws (Davidson 1993, 9\u201312). His point appears to be that if\nbacking by law is sufficient for explanatory relevance, then mental\nproperties are explanatorily relevant. (Davidson and his critics often\nslide between the issues of causal and explanatory relevance, but the\nlatter issue is clearly what is at stake given Davidson\u2019s views\nabout causal efficacy and properties.) Second, Davidson appeals to the\nsupervenience of mental properties on physical properties in order to\nground the explanatory role of mental properties. Davidson says\nthat\n\n\nproperties are causally efficacious if they make a difference to what\nindividual events cause, and supervenience ensures that\nmental properties do make a difference to what mental events cause.\n(Davidson 1993, 15)\n\n\nThe first point does not get developed by Davidson in any systematic\nway, though it has been explored by others interested in defending\nnonreductive monism from epiphenomenalist concerns. Some have focused\non exploiting ceteris paribus covering laws for\npsychophysical causal relations, claiming that this allows mental\nproperties to be sufficient for their effects, thus providing the\nneeded type of explanatory role (McLaughlin 1989; Fodor 1989, 1991).\nOthers have attempted to sidestep the issue of covering laws entirely\nby appealing directly to the truth of psychological and psychophysical\ncounterfactuals in grounding the explanatory role of mental properties\n(LePore and Loewer 1987, 1989; Horgan 1989). Davidson himself instead\nfocused on supervenience (although as we are about to see, the\npossibility of ceteris paribus laws enters into his\naccount).\n\nSupervenience implies that\n\n\nif two events differ in their psychological properties, they differ in\ntheir physical properties (which we assume to be causally\nefficacious). If supervenience holds, psychological properties make a\ndifference to the causal relations of an event, for they matter to the\nphysical properties, and the physical properties matter to causal\nrelations. (Davidson 1993, 14) \n\n\nThe point here is not simply that mental properties inherit or\npiggyback on the causal powers of the physical properties on which\nthey supervene. Rather, Davidson appears to be claiming that mental\nproperties influence the causal powers of their subvenient\nphysical properties.\n\nOne problem with Davidson\u2019s response here is its reversal of the\ndependency relationship between mental and physical properties\ntypically claimed in supervenience relationships. A central rationale\nfor positing supervenience is to mark a kind of explanatory primacy to\nthe subvenient properties (see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n And this is reflected in the first part of Davidson\u2019s\nformulation above\u2014surely a difference in psychological\nproperties entails (requires) a difference in physical properties\nbecause the difference in physical properties is needed in\norder to explain the difference in psychological properties.\nSo the sense in which psychological properties \u2018matter\u2019 to\nphysical properties is that changing the former amounts to a change in\nthe latter because a change in the latter explains a change\nin the former. This does not appear to be helpful in establishing the\nexplanatory relevance of mental properties. Another problem, discussed\nabove\n (5.3),\n is that it is difficult to see how a supervenience relation of\nsufficient power to make mental properties explanatory of an\nevent\u2019s physical properties in the way Davidson seems to suggest\ndoes not issue in strict laws. So it is unclear how supervenience is\nconsistent with the anomalism principle, and thus how it can help\nblock epiphenomenalist concerns, although we did previously note one\npotentially worthwhile but unexplored possibility\u2014a ceteris\nparibus supervenience relation\u2014which Davidson endorses.\n",
