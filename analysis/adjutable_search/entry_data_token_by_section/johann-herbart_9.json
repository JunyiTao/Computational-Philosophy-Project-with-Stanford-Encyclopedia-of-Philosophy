    "main_text": "Psychology || Apperception\n3.8 Apperception\n3.8.1 Background\nHerbart is perhaps most famous for his theory of apperception and\nits application to the problems of the ego and self-consciousness\n(Boring 1950: 256\u20137; Stout 1888b: 498). He considers these\nnotions and their metaphysical elaboration as faculties or powers to\nbe nonsense, giving rise to paradoxes of self-consciousness; for\nexample, \u201ca faculty of self-observation [introspection]\u201d\nraises the specter of an infinite regress of\n\u201cself\u201d-observing powers (SW VI: 140). This is not to deny\nthat ego, self-consciousness, or self-perception answer to genuine\npsychological phenomena. Rather, it is to set a task for psychology,\nnamely how to account for these psychological facts solely in terms of\nrepresentations and without recourse to faculties, since\n\nin the soul there are only representations; and\nout of these everything must be composed that is to appear in\nconsciousness. (SW VI: 141)\n\n Because Herbart\u2019s theory of apperception is\nultimately about the formation (Bildung) or structuring of\nthe ego, it also provides the cornerstone of his theory of education\n(Bildung) (Hayward 1907: 15; Boring 1950: 257; Weiss 1928:\n98).\nAs we have seen, representations never appear singly, but\ncontinuously interact, complicating and fusing with or inhibiting\neach other. They form sequences and series, which, in turn, get\ninterwoven with each other, forming stable groupings called\nrepresentational masses. Simply put, \u201capperception\u201d is\nHerbart\u2019s term for the assimilation of one representation or\nrepresentational mass into another. In this section I will explain\nnot only the mechanism of this process, but also why Herbart calls it\n\u201capperception\u201d.[65]\n3.8.2 Mechanics of apperception\nWe earlier dealt with the fusion and complication of\nrepresentations, i.e., with the laws governing the formation of\nrepresentational series and masses. We are therefore already familiar\nwith the laws of the assimilative process called\n\u201capperception\u201d, but only from the \u201coutside\u201d,\nobserving the representational masses objectively. To understand the\nassimilative process as \u201capperception\u201d proper, we must\nnow recall that representations are not (merely) represented\n\u201cobjects\u201d of consciousness (repraesent\u0101ta),\nbut (also)\u2014as perturbations of the\nsoul\u2014representing \u201csubjects\u201d of\nconsciousness (repraesentantia). In other words,\nrepresentations, as bewu\u00dft or\nconscious,[66]\n must be (also) conceived as\n\u201cobserving\u201d, of \u201cbeing-aware\u201d\n(beobachtend). Always keeping this peculiar characteristic\nof Herbartian representations in mind, let us consider his\ninterpretation of the phenomenon that has been (in his view)\nmistakenly called \u201cinner sense\u201d or a \u201cfaculty of\nself-observation [Selbst-Beobachtung, i.e.,\nintrospection]\u201d. He writes:\n\nOne representation (or representation-mass) is\nobserved; another representation (or representation-mass) is\nthe observer. (SW VI: 141; emphasis added)\nIn order to support this claim, Herbart considers two cases: (a)\nthe assimilation of a sense-representation (a \u201csensum\u201d),\ncalled \u201couter apperception\u201d; and (b) the assimilation of a\nreproduced (i.e., recollected) representation from below\nthe limen, called \u201cinner apperception\u201d (Stout\n1888b: 448). The latter is treated as analogous to the former (Stout\n1889: 448).\n3.8.2.1 Outer apperception\nA new sense perception or perceptual series, \\(W, w, \\mathfrak{w},\n\\omega\\) (\u201c\\(W\\)\u201d for Wahrnehmung, sense\nperception), always appears in an arena of consciousness already\noccupied by some older representation or representational group, \\(R,\nr, \\mathfrak{r}, \\rho\\) (SW VI: 143). At first, the \u201cunarrested\nintensity\u201d of \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) gives it as it were the drop on\nthe pre-existing representations, initially forcing them down against\nthe threshold (Stout 1888b: 484; SW VI: 143). At the same time, in\naccordance with the psycho-mechanical laws of reproduction, elements\nof the new series (e.g., \\(w, \\mathfrak{w}\\)) reawaken the\nsubliminal similars amongst the older representations (e.g.,\n\\(r,\\mathfrak{r}\\)), and fuse with these, while simultaneously\ninhibiting the dissimilars (e.g., \\(R, \\rho\\)). But the\nsimilars (\\(r, \\mathfrak{r}\\)), being themselves more strongly bound to\nthe dissimilars (\\(R, \\rho\\)) (as members of the same mass), gradually\ndraw up the latter, and so the whole mass \\((R, r, \\mathfrak{r}, \\rho)\\)\nreturns more strongly to inhibit \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) (cf. esp. Stout\n1888b: 484). As Stout points out, the returning pre-formation \\((R, r,\n\\ldots)\\) would seem likely to suppress \\(W, w, \\ldots\\) except for\ntheir \u201cpoints of affinity\u201d:\n\nSo far as they are homogeneous they fuse. The\nappercipient group retains in consciousness what is kindred to itself,\nand at the same time represses what is antagonistic. (Stout 1888b:\n485)\n\n Hence\n\nthe sense-given group \\([W, w, \\ldots]\\) becomes\n[after considerable modification] incorporated with the pre-existing\nsystem of presentations \\([R, r, \\ldots]\\). (Stout 1888b:\n485)\n3.8.2.2 Inner apperception\nThe process of outer apperception provides the model for inner\napperception (SW VI: 141). Simply replace the sensa \\(W,\nw,\\ldots\\) with a relatively weak representational series \\(m, n, o,\n\\boldsymbol{p}, q, \\ldots\\) already present in (as opposed to newly\nentering) the soul. If now there is in consciousness at the same time\na second \u201cstable and powerful mass\u201d, \\(P, \\mathrm{P},\n\\boldsymbol{p}, \\pi, \\ldots\\), the two series will complicate with or\n\u201cfold into\u201d each other, generating some new complex (such\nas \\(Pm\\) or \\(Pn\\)) that has elements from each series (Stout 1888b:\n485). Now from each member of the new complex, two chains of\nreproduction will evolve, e.g., in the case of \\(Pm\\), one from \\(P\\),\nand another from \\(m\\). Each of these two chains strives to unfold\nitself according to its own law. But because both series contain the\ncommon member \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\), the evolving chains must fuse at\nthis node and so reinforce each other. As in the case of outer\napperception, the m-series is initially more vivacious and\ndepresses the P-series. As they interact, the greater\nstrength and coherence of the P-series reacts,\n\u201c[re-]form[ing] the [weaker m-series] in its own\nimage\u201d: the stronger mass preserves the similar elements in the\nweaker by fusing with it, while driving it back at other, dissimilar\npoints (SW VI: 144). From the point at which the two chains are fused\nat \\(\\boldsymbol{p}\\), their respective reproductions cannot continue,\nas they would have separately. Instead, they now become interwoven\ninto a new representational mass with \u201ca new total-force\u201d\n(SW VI: 141).\nIn both inner and outer apperception, we find a stronger and more\nstable structure into which a relatively unsettled and hence weaker\nelement is integrated. They are drawn together at nodes of\nsimilarity, while dissimilarity blocks a complete fusion. As a result\nof this contest of forces, the weaker element gets stuck or\n\u201cfixed\u201d by the stronger. Now recall that both stronger\nand weaker elements on this account are representings;\ntherefore the stronger one will be the observ-ing\n(\u201cawar-ing\u201d) consciousness, while the weaker one, while\nnot un-conscious (for it is stuck above\nthe limen), is the observ-ed. In the above example,\nthe m-series will be \u201cobserved\u201d \u201clike an\nobject\u201d by the P-series (SW VI:\n144).[67] It\nis just this unbalanced relation between representations (or\nrepresentational structures and elements) that constitutes the\nphenomenon of self-perception, i.e., apperception.\n3.8.3 Apperception and perception\nHerbart\u2019s account of apperception is closely linked to the\nphenomenon of attention, for, as Stout puts it, \u201cto be in\nconsciousness is not the same thing as to be an [explicit] object of\nconsciousness\u201d:\n\n[t]here is always a dim margin of\n[re]presentations, which, though not distinctly attended to, are none\nthe less components of the total conscious state. (Stout 1888b: 485)\n\n Consider the following situation: one is\nengrossed in an activity like reading or a game, and so fails to\nnotice a background noise, like a refrigerator\u2019s hum. Only when\nthe hum \u201csuddenly\u201d stops do we realize that it had been\n\u201cin our consciousness\u201d all along, yet without being an\n\u201cobject of consciousness\u201d.  Hence, if to perceive is to\nattend, then sense perception depends on an apperceiving mass (Stout\n1888b: 486). It is only when the dimmed representation begins to fuse\nwith the vivacious grouping at the center of awareness that the\nformer\n\nacquire[s] that peculiar distinctness, which we\nexpress by saying that we notice it, observe it, or attend to it, or\nthat it is an object of notice, observation or attention.  (Stout\n1888b: 485)\n\n Thus, in one respect, sensation always precedes\napperception, namely insofar as all representations and their\ngroupings originate in sensory disturbances (SW VI: 143). Yet\ngenuine perception, even of sensa, depends in turn\non apperception, for only apperception allows us to attend\nto the sensed \u201cas\u201d or \u201cin terms of\u201d the\napperceiving mass to which it is being assimilated (Stout 1888b: 485,\nf., \u00a729). As we saw in Section 3.7.2, this is just to\nsay that we need a representational mass called a\n\u201cconcept\u201d in order to recognize a new representation as\nan instance of it, and thus in the full sense to perceive it at\nall.\n3.8.4 Apperception, self-control, and education\nApperception is closely connected to morality, as we will see in\nmore detail in the section on Herbart\u2019s ethics. It is\ninteresting to note, however, that even in his discussion of inner\nperception (or as we might call it, \u201cself-awareness\u201d), his\nexamples all have a normative dimension. Thus, as in the case of an\nunattended external humming noise, which we suddenly realize\nhas been going on in the margin of consciousness, so too we most\neasily recognize inner perception when it lapses, e.g., when\none lets slip a secret, or inappropriately laughs or yawns (SW VI:\n145). One ought to have noticed and resisted the incipient\nimpulses towards these actions (SW VI: 145). In\nshort, self-control is a case of inner perception. Hence, in\nthe case of \u201cweak or uneducated people, children, and esp. of\nanimals\u201d, one does not \u201cexpect them to mark their inner\nconditions\u201d (SW VI: 145).\nOn Herbart\u2019s theory, such cases of failing to arrest or\n\u201cfix\u201d a representational evolution may be explained by the\nabsence of representational masses sufficiently articulated and\nstrengthened, not just into \u201cconcepts\u201d, but into clear\njudgments formed out of these concepts, which are called\n\u201cmaxims\u201d (SW VI: 146). It is the educated person\nwho \u201cshould know better\u201d, who is expected to have maxims\nthat arise to ward off foolish, inappropriate, or unethical impulses.\nThese \u201cmaxim\u201d-masses are called \u201cinner\nperceptions\u201d (self-consciousness or self-control) just when they\nsuccessfully \u201coutstrip, fix, and govern\n[beherrschen]\u201d rough and precipitate excitations (SW\nVI: 146).\nThe German word for \u201ceducation\u201d is\n\u201cBildung\u201d, literally: \u201cformation\u201d.\nNow, apperception depends on the action of dominant representational\nmasses, and self-control and self-awareness are functions of\napperception. Thus the educator has a keen interest in forming or\nshaping the incipient concept- and maxim-masses in the young. Unless\nraw masses are strengthened and clarified, they will remain\n\u201cmere heaps [of representations] lacking inner formation and\norder [Ausbildung und Anordnung], as in the case of rough\npersons\u201d (SW VI: 147). The more reticulated representational\nchains become, the more defined, stable, and effective are the\nresulting concept-masses. These in turn allow for the most acute\nperception, as a\n\nskilled musician \u2026 will pick out of a\nlarge choir of voices the one which is at fault \u2026 [or the]\nphysician perceives in an instant symptoms which have escaped the long\nand anxious scrutiny\n\n of the inexpert (Stout 1888b: 486).  Similarly,\nthe development of moral concepts will produce the morally perceptive\nperson, as we will discuss in Section 5.\n3.8.5 Apperception and ego-consciousness\nApperception or \u201cself-consciousness\u201d seems naturally to\ninvolve the notion of the ego or \u201cI\u201d: for what could\nself-consciousness be other than a self or ego that has somehow turned\nits thought back upon itself, so as to be simultaneously subject and\nobject of awareness? (SW VI: 169) Now Herbart believes that his\naccount of apperception will reveal the substantial \u201cI\u201d to\nbe but an illusion generated by the interplay among differential\nrepresentational masses (SW VI: 141). Nevertheless, although there is\nno such thing as the \u201cego\u201d, yet this does not\nmean that there is no phenomenon answering to the word,\n\u201cI\u201d. We constantly make use of the first-person singular\npronoun, which somehow expresses a first-person awareness,\nan ego-consciousness, and this psychological state is clearly\nof central importance. Herbart tries to explain the ego (correctly\nconceived) in naturalistic terms, viz. as the evolution of\nrepresentational masses from childhood to adulthood.\nHe analyzes the genesis of self-consciousness as the evolution\nof apperception. From a complex of bodily sensations, desires, and\naversions, the child becomes aware of representations\nin other beings, which it conceives as pictures carried\naround in their bodies.  As that conception joins with observed\nintentional activities in animals and people\u2014i.e., actions they\ncarry out for their own satisfaction\u2014the \u201citself\u201d\narises, though in the third person. Only when such recursive phenomena\nare apperceived within my own body does the representation\nof my self arise (SW VI: 177). This bodily self, then,\nappears as the \u201cgathering place\u201d not just of my\nrepresentations, but also as the \u201corigin of all\nmovements connected physiologically with bodily feelings\u201d,\nthe pole of all attraction and repulsion.\n3.8.5.1 The growth of ego-consciousness\nThis nexus persists through time, and constantly receiving\nadditions, forming and reforming itself. Hence, Bildung, in\nthe most literal sense, is the constant accumulation\nof Bilder (pictures) around this node (SW VI: 177). As the\nhuman being begins to reflect upon its \u201cself\u201d, it becomes\naware of its overriding determination as a representing,\nknowing, cognizing entity; and the further\nits Bildung advances, the more this conviction grows (SW VI:\n178; 180). Hence, \u201cI\u201d, the being that exists in this way,\nbecome aware of myself as not a thing, but an act-ing.\nEspecially important for the Ausbildung or development of\nself-consciousness is the reminiscence of the past. For in this way\none comes to see a difference between that center of past\n(psychic) conditions and current ones; hence all psychic conditions\nare recognized as accidental: the individual itself cannot be\nreduced to any one of them, and hence appears, in apperception, to\nstand forth as distinct from them (SW VI: 179). Thus, we come\nincreasingly to see our selves as distinct from our external\nenvironment, and from the here and now, and a (representational)\ncomplex emerges \u201cof which all the component parts may be\nnegated, so that none of them seems essential to it\u201d\u2014and\nthis is the ego (SW VI: 180).\nAlthough the ego comes into focus through reflection on its own\npast, yet it is always in the present, projecting itself into the\nfuture. This leads to the conception of the ego as a\n\u201cdrive\u201d (SW VI: 182). But a drive to sense,\nexperience, or act always implies a goal. Hence \u201cthe ego appears\nmost clearly in its outer activity\u201d (SW VI: 182):\nit represents its action to itself, and assumes a cognitive\ndistance from its actions. \u201cIt knows what it is about to do, and\nit also knows what it did\u201d (SW VI: 182). In this way, the ego\nprogressively abstracts itself from its activity, and eventually\nappears to itself as a \u201cmere knowing that now has no\nobject\u201d (SW VI: 182). Further, by being with others in public,\nwe come to notice an inner private sphere; for while other people and\nthings may appear opaque, \u201cthe ego is always present to\nitself\u201d (SW VI: 183). Thus the educated (gebildet)\nperson comes to ascribe\n\na soul to himself, indeed a character,\n[which he respects] as higher than the body. The inner perception is\n[now] seen as the source of knowledge of the true self. (SW VI:\n186)\n3.8.5.2 Dispelling the illusion of the ego\nHerbart continues:\n\n\nBut now comes philosophical reflection, which denies true\nself-knowledge to inner perception. It does not care about\nthe temporal being, the individual, but wants to\nknow about its [sc. the individual\u2019s] enduring and\nfixed foundation. It now discovers itself gradually, viz. that\nperception utterly lacks the actual soul-essence, the substance of the\nsoul; and that such a substance has to be attached to it in\nthought\u2026. Nevertheless, the ego remains the genuine, ever\nselfsame identity of the representing with the represented [thing].\nThis ego appears as a given, as the most secure and indisputable fact\nof consciousness. \u2026 A peculiar kind of cognition is invented\nfor this: a pure, intellectual power. But if one\nasks what this [thing] is, which intellectual intuition\nintuits, there appears the absurd concept of an ego severed from the individual. (SW VI: 186; cf. Beiser 2014:\n133)\nThus, the ego reaches the complete illusion of itself as a\nperduring substance.\n3.8.5.3 The method of relations, again\nHerbart corrects this metaphysical illusion of the ego-soul through\nhis method of relations.\n\nAs with all concepts that lack an essential\ncomponent [yet] to which they stand in relation,\nwithout containing it or immediately indicating it: so here,\ntoo, in the case of the ego, the illusion lies in this, that one\nimagines this concept to be thinkable [even] after separating out\neverything particular and individual. (SW VI: 187)\n\n In other words, abstracted from its\n\u201ccontents\u201d, the ego does not exist: it\n\n\nis a point, that is and can be represented only insofar as innumerable [representational] sequences point back to it, viz. as their common presupposition\n\n or anchor (SW VI: 168).  It is merely a notional\npoint of reference, a common node of all representational series (SW\nVI: 168).\nThis analysis brings into focus the relation of soul to ego. Recall\nthe metaphysical axiom, that the soul is a simple\nwhole\u2014originally not representing\u2014whose\nself-preservations against various disturbances result in\n\u201crepresentings\u201d. The soul in itself, in its\nsimple and thus unknowable quality as not representing soul,\ncannot become either subject or object of consciousness. But the\nsoul with respect to all of its representations is the true\nsubject: the one, undivided, yet most variously active subject of all\nconsciousness.  Now as we consider psychic activity to\nbe generally a representing over against a\nrepresented, there arises the peculiar case where the\nrepresented entity is identical with itself (SW VI: 190\u20131). The\nsoul \u201cunfold[s] the represented world; and, in the middle of the\nworld, the represented, own self\u201d (SW VI: 191).\nThis represented self, then, is the ego, the apperceptive\nsystem of the soul\u2019s perturbations. As we will see in the final\nsection on Herbart\u2019s pedagogy, education just amounts to the\nbest development of this ego, i.e., its virtuous character. This\neducation (Ausbildung) culminates in science, by which\nHerbart means the soul\u2019s self-knowledge in terms of his\npsychology. For this \u201cscience speaks of the soul\nas the ground of the represented world and of its own\nSelf\u201d. Thus, while Herbart\u2019s language of a culminating,\nreflective science of the self may remind one of an Idealistic\nabsolute science, he takes great pains to distance his notion of\nscience from speculative or intuitionistic\nmetaphysics. Yes, in \u201cscience\u201d, the knower is the\nsoul, and \u201cknowing and known are one and the same, viz. the soul\nin the system of its self-preservations\u201d; however, he adds,\n\u201cI know of myself, not with innate, but with a\npermanently acquired knowledge\u201d (SW VI: 191).\n4. Aesthetics & ethics\n4.1 Aesthetics\nWhereas metaphysics and psychology deal with the real, aesthetics\nconcerns just those concepts \u201cthat solely indicate a value or\ndisvalue\u201d (Weiss 1928: 108; cf. SW XI: 24; 26). Aesthetics is\nthus a science of values. In particular, aesthetics inquires\ninto the beautiful, which is not a cognitive concept, i.e., no\npredicate of beings insofar as they exist. Rather the beautiful\n\u201cdenotes the way \u2026 an object is apprehended by an\nobserver\u2026\u201d (SW IV: 500; cf. Weiss 1928: 109).\nBeauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and is\nan experience of the subject. At the same time, the beautiful\nis not something merely subjective like a feeling of pleasantness, for\nit arises and subsists in the observer only with respect to an\nobject (cf. SW IV: 602). What the aesthetic conception articulates\nabout the object does not \u201cdepend on any individuality, but\nrather solely on the quality of the represented [object]\u201d (SW\nVI: 273). Suppose I declare: \u201cRembrandt\u2019s Aristotle\nwith a Bust of Homer is beautiful\u201d. On the one hand, the\nbeauty of the painting is something that lies not in the\npainting, but in my, the beholder\u2019s experience of it. But the\npredicate, \u201cis beautiful\u201d, does not attach to my\nexperience, but to its object, the painting. I do not claim that my\nexperience is beautiful, but that the painting is. Nor am I merely\nsaying that it seems beautiful to me; rather, the\nclaim pertains to the painting itself, viz. that it is\nbeautiful.\n4.1.1 Aesthetic judgment\nFor Herbart, an aesthetic judgment is marked by the immediacy\nand involuntariness with which it is made. Such judgments are, in\nother words, independent of the personal preference of the subject,\nand are, in a sense, forced upon her. They are warranted by a\npeculiar, originary kind of evidence springing from the observation of\nthe object (SW X: 318). They are clear, without having been learned or\nproved, and stand forth as absolute and non-negotiable claims (SW IV:\n105; 47).  This absolute and self-evident character lets aesthetic\njudgments function as the principles of a science of\naesthetics.\n\nThey let aesthetic feeling be brought into the\nform of a judgment, let the beautiful be treated scientifically, and\nlet aesthetics become a science of principles. (Weiss 1928:\n109)\nSuch immediate, involuntary judgments arise upon the\n\u201ccomplete [or perfect] representation of the object [of the\njudgment]\u201d: \u201cthe beautiful is the effect of complete [or\nperfect] representation\u201d (Weiss 1928: 110). By \u201ccomplete\nrepresentation\u201d, Herbart means the kind that arises of itself in\nthe utterly non-partisan observer, moved by the object alone. A\nbeautiful object will necessarily find favor, an ugly object distaste,\nfor it appears clearly to one free \u201cof the disturbing pressures\nand demands of the will\u201d (SW III: 526). In short, aesthetic\njudgment depends on a contemplative state of ataraxic indifference or\nwill-less-ness (Willenlosigkeit) (cf. SW II: 335; Beiser\n2014: 126).\n4.1.2 Aesthetic validity and \u201cconscience\u201d\nThe aesthetic judgment is synthetic, connecting the theoretical\ncognition of the object with its evaluation. The former is the subject\nof the judgment, the latter its predicate (SW IX: 80; 329, n.*).\nHerbart does not, of course, regard such judgments as functions of\na power of judgment. Rather, judgments of taste are the\ninvoluntary effect of any perfect representation, \u201cprovided the\nlatter does not immediately disappear in the flux\u201d of psychic\nchange (SW II: 45). The aesthetic judgment seems to possess an\nabsolute validity. This might seem strange, given the subjectivity of\ntaste, but as we saw above, the neutral judge\u2019s judgment makes a\nclaim about the object (cf. Kant, Critique of Judgment,\n\u00a7\u00a72, 4).  But there is a further problem: if each aesthetic\njudgment pertains to a single and particular representation, how can\nit have universal validity? (Cf. esp. Beiser 2014: 129) On\nHerbart\u2019s view, it gains the \u201cappearance of an enduring,\nindeed eternal authority\u201d, thanks to a kind of \u201csubjective\nnecessity\u201d (SW II: 350). That is, although each new perfected\nrepresentation inevitably draws after it a new judgment, yet it is\nalso true that the same representation will always provoke the same\njudgment (SW II: 350). In other words, under identical subjective and\nobjective conditions, the same aesthetic judgment must recur,\nand this produces the appearance of eternal validity.\nNow, as one repeatedly passes aesthetic judgments and becomes aware\nof their peculiar validity, they come to exert \u201ca slow pressure\nupon the [individual], who calls it his\n\u2018conscience\u2019\u201d (SW I: 265). Only he who repeatedly\ngenerates aesthetic judgments in fact acquires such a\n\u201cconscience\u201d. We may take Herbart to be speaking here of a\nsense of artistic propriety characteristic of the connoisseur or the\ntrained musician. In musical practice, for example, one makes myriad\njudgments regarding the tempo, articulation, or dynamics. Over time,\nthese fuse into stable appercipient masses\u2014the musical\n\u201cconscience\u201d\u2014and music conflicting with them seems\n\u201cwrong\u201d and must be criticized. Such a Herbartian\nconscience is no kind of faculty of taste or judgment, but a facility\nacquired in accordance with the laws of concept formation.\n4.1.3 The beautiful\nMuch as Aristotle rejects Plato\u2019s unitary conception of the\nGood, Herbart emphasizes the particularity of the\nbeautiful. Aesthetics cannot and ought not try to abstract from\nindividual judgments of taste in order to discover \u201cthe\u201d\ncommon essence of the beautiful (or the ugly). This is because Herbart\nholds the original aesthetic judgments, in their\nabsoluteness, to be the principles of\naesthetics. \n\n[Their] evidence, \u2026 absoluteness, and \u2026 perfect\nrepresentation of the object as the indispensable preconditions of the\npossibility [of such judgments] exclude the possibility of any highest\naesthetic propositions [Grunds\u00e4tze] \u2026 to which a\nnumber of aesthetic judgments \u2026 should be subordinated. (SW IV:\n47)\nAlthough it is universally true of the aesthetic that the\nobject involuntarily pleases or repels, yet the objects of aesthetic\njudgment themselves cannot be reduced to a formula. If one abstracts\nfrom their particularity, one is left with \u201cno object containing\nsomething that an aesthetic judgment could determine\u201d.\nWhat is it in the object that elicits approval or\ndisapproval\u2014what lets an object be judged\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d? Beauty is a function of relations\n(Verh\u00e4ltnisse) or form, as in the \u201crelations in\nthe outline of a statue, in the characters of a drama, of tones in\nmusical chords\u201d (SW IX: 329; cf. SW IX: 313, SW II: 344). For\nthis reason, Herbart holds that only an object exhibiting internal\nstructure or a relation to other objects can have aesthetic\ninterest. An object without relations is \u201caesthetically\ninsignificant\u201d (Weiss 1928: 115). In music, no single tone can\nbe considered, in itself, beautiful or ugly, although single tones\nconstitute the intervals and chords that, as relations, elicit\naesthetic judgment (cf. SW II: 344).  Hence the axiom of all\naesthetics is this:\n\nAll simple aesthetic elements must themselves be\nrelations, viz., relations whose relata, considered in\nthemselves, have no aesthetic value. (SW III: 331)\n\n We now see better what it is that aesthetic\njudgments express approval or disapproval of, viz. relations that can\nbe grasped in a single representing act (Weiss 1928: 116).\n4.1.4 The task of aesthetics as a discipline\nThus aesthetics starts with the simplest formal determinations\nunderlying approbation or disapproval (Weiss 1928: 117). Its\ndisciplinary task is\n\n\nneither to define, nor demonstrate, nor deduce, nor even to\ndistinguish amongst types of art or argue about a given work of art.\nRather, it should reveal the simple relations that generate\napprobation or deprecation in case of a perfect representing. It\nshould make us conscious \u2026 of the specific approbation\nand of the specific disapproval that is originally proper to any\nparticular relationship whatsoever. (SW II: 345)\nThe concepts we use to think these elemental relations Herbart\ncalls \u201cparadigms or Ideas\u201d (Weiss 1928: 118). The\nexhaustive presentation of these elementary relations grounds\naesthetics as a science. Once they are in hand, it can survey all\npossible aesthetic relations, as in figured bass. Indeed, Herbart\nconsiders figured bass to be the only existing model of an aesthetic\nscience, for it \u201cdemands and receives an absolute judgment for\nits simple intervals, chords, and progressions, without proving or\nexplaining anything\u201d (SW II: 345).\nShould these universal aesthetic Ideas be organized in a general\naesthetics, they could then be applied in different material spheres,\ne.g., of color, tone, figure, but also, crucially, of relations of\nthe will. Such specific ramifications of the paradigms are called\n\u201ctechniques\u201d (Kunstlehren) or \u201cpractical\nsciences\u201d (SW IV: 47). The discipline dealing with the\nparadigmatic elements of approbation or disapprobation of relations of\nwill is practical philosophy, i.e., ethics, to which we now\nturn.\n4.2 Ethics\nAll evaluative judgments are aesthetic; they evaluate the\nrepresented relations in their object. Practical philosophy\nor ethics evaluates relations of the will. Therefore, ethical\njudgments are a kind of aesthetic judgment (cf. SW VII: 10; SW X: 309;\nBeiser 2014: 108; 125, ff.). Because such judgments often conflict,\nthe task of practical philosophy is not to pass judgment itself, but\nto cause us to judge correctly. Hence, all practical philosophy can\nand should do is to \u201ccorrectly present the object, [in such a\nway] as to be perfectly grasped\u201d, that object being relations of\nthe will (SW II: 334); thus, as figured bass presents a theory of\nbeautiful tonal relations, practical philosophy seeks the \u201cwhole\nset of relations by which the will becomes the object of\npraise or blame\u201d (SW IX: 329: n.*). Like Kant, Herbart holds\nthat the determining grounds of moral action must be found in a\npriori norms, and rejects eudemonism or any \u201cmaterial\nmotives\u201d as grounds for practical laws (cf. Beiser 2014: 94,\n125, ff.). For Herbart as for Kant, morally evaluative judgments are\nto be made solely with an eye to the \u201cform of the will\u201d,\nwhich ethics determines.\n4.2.1 The object of practical judgment\nPractical judgment judges the \u201cwill\u201d, a species of\ndesire marked by determinate cognition and fixing of its object, and\nby conviction that the object is attainable. While I might desire to\nleap tall buildings in a bound, I cannot will it (SW II: 99). Now the\nvalue of the will\u2019s object cannot determine its evaluation,\nsince Herbart like Kant excludes all material grounds as determinative\nof moral action. Hence the will itself is the object of\nevaluation\u2014but how? Because every instance of willing is\nnonetheless bound to its object, individual acts of willing\ncannot be the object of moral evaluation. Further, an act of willing\nisolated from its object also cannot be the object of moral\nevaluation, since\n\notherwise, the difference between a good and evil\nwill would disappear: willing and willing-well would be one and the\nsame. (Weiss 1928: 122)\nHerbart\u2019s solution to the dilemma is to say that practical\nphilosophy considers the will not in itself, but only insofar as it\nenters into relation with another\nwill.[68] It\nis these various possible relations among wills\nthat constitute the possible forms of the will, and that are judged\nfine or shameful by practical judgment (SW X: 348). In this way, the\naesthetic elements and paradigmatic Ideas of general aesthetics\ngovern practical philosophy, as well.\n4.2.2 The paradigms or Ideas of practical philosophy\nHerbart identifies five such elementary relations of will that\ndemand aesthetic approval, viz., the Ideas of inner freedom;\nperfection; benevolence; right; fairness/justice (SW II: 356). The\nfirst Idea is the Idea of Ideas, i.e., the general decision\nor determination of the will always \u201cto act in accordance with\nthe patterns as patterns, in accordance with taste in\ngeneral\u201d (SW II: 357). Unlike the other Ideas, inner freedom is\na paradigm that is unconditionally pleasing, and which therefore does\nnot need to be commanded. On the other hand, the will can easily come\ninto conflict with the other four paradigms, and such conflict\nis displeasing. The insight of practical judgment into the\nparadigmatic pleasing-ness of the Ideas therefore makes itself felt as\na demand to neutralize that conflict:\n\n[t]he ethical commandment springs solely out of\njudgments of displeasure, and appears when, and for as long as, a\nwilling conflicts with the practical Idea.\n4.2.3 The virtuous human being\nHerbart\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas naturally leads to the notion of\nvirtue or human excellence, for \u201cthe ideal, complete realization\nof inner freedom [just] is the virtue of the\nindividual\u201d (Weiss 1928: 145; cf. SW II: 409, ff.,\nesp. 411\u201312). Here we advance from aesthetic pleasure in the\nparadigms of the will to their actual realization: \u201cVirtue does\nnot forever stay home but strides forth into an alien world\u201d (SW\nII: 414). Thus the individual who sees and approves of the practical\nIdeas also feels compelled to enact them in a coherent way of\nlife. This unity is the Ideal of virtue, according to which\n\u201cno part of [practical] insight may lack the corresponding\nwill[,] and there should be no lack of connection among its\nparts\u201d (SW II: 412). The virtuous life must exclude vice and\nlack of virtue, and react to the situations that at every turn demand\nvirtue\u2019s activity (SW II: 412\u201313).\nInstead of an indefinitely ramifying list of duties to achieve this\nideal, Herbart proposes that the sense of art or Kunstsinn\ncan help us gain an overview of virtue (SW II: 415). That is,\nlife\u2019s circumstances appear as a matter to be formed, and the\nvirtuous person is able to judge the finest way in which a\nsituation should be handled (SW II: 416). But because the artistic\nsense is in constant conflict with external forces and internal\nfeelings, it must be continually rekindled (SW II: 417). Hence, the\nIdeal of virtue can be at best asymptotically approached and it is\nthis approach that Herbart calls \u201cmorality\u201d. Since an\napproach implies a temporal sequence, human life may be understood as\na chain of ethical actions and passions (SW II: 417, f.).\nHerbart analyzes this chain into three main parts. First, there is\nvirtue as \u201cthe picture of a beautiful reality\u201d, belonging\nto imagination, dream, and fantasy, in which the need for intervening\nin reality is lacking: the Ideas are simply assumed as universally\neffective (SW II: 417\u201318). Second, the need to act arises, and\nthe striving will encounters obstacles even within the sphere of\nthought.  Finally, we really act, and try to realize the beautiful\nworld of thought (SW II: 418). While social reality hampers the\nachievement of virtue, the individual, conscious of his inner freedom,\nmust try to find all possible avenues towards moral fulfillment (Weiss\n1928: 156).  It is in preparing the individual for a life of moral\naction that education is required.\n5. Pedagogy\nHerbart writes:\nThe sole and entire task of education\n[Erziehung] is encompassed by the concept,\n\u201cmorality\u201d [Moralit\u00e4t]. (SW I: 259)\n\n If virtue is the realization of human freedom,\nthen the goal of Herbartian education is to make the\nchild capable of living virtuously, viz., by forming the\npupil\u2019s character. For reasons that will become clearer below,\nHerbart identifies moral character with a \u201cmany-sided\u201d\ncharacter. Many-sidedness is a regulative ideal guiding one\u2019s\nstriving towards full individuality: the teacher helps the pupil\ndevelop all his[69]\n unique talents and interests as far and as\ncoherently as possible. That is, the teacher helps the pupil\nsystematically connect his interests around the central principle\nthat is his\n self.[70]\n5.1 Many-sidedness and \u201cinterest\u201d\nInstruction aiming at many-sidedness has two main phases,\n\u201cengrossment\u201d (Vertiefung) and\n\u201creflection\u201d (Besinnung), each of which in turn\nhas a \u201cresting\u201d and a \u201cprogressive\u201d moment:\nresting engrossment is \u201cclarity\u201d; progressive engrossment\nis \u201cassociation\u201d; resting reflection is\n\u201csystem\u201d; progressive reflection is \u201cmethod\u201d\n(SW II: 38, ff.; cf. esp. Gl\u00f6ckner 1892; Beiser 2014:\n106\u20137). It is important to note that these phases of learning\nrecapitulate the process of apperception. That is, clarity occurs\nwhen a representation or representational series comes into full\nconsciousness, where it hovers in the full light of attention. One is\nengrossed in it, which is simply to say, one is not aware\nof anything else. But of course the child\u2019s mind rarely stays\noccupied with a single representation for long; its imagination\n(Phantasie) rapidly leads it, usually by association, to\nother, similar representations (SW II: 40).  This spontaneity of\nabsorption in environing objects is the source of a natural\nmany-sidedness, and thus the seed of the fully formed personality. While the phases of engrossment are natural to all human\nbeings, it is obvious that in themselves they have no direction or\norganizing \n principle.[71]\nThe teacher does not simply give the principle to the\nchild. Rather, his instruction aims to bring the child by stages to\nrecognize the principle on and as its own, by reflecting on\nits immediate experience. The child\u2019s maturity determines the\nscope of reflection, but she will always fall short of the full\nself-reflection characteristic of the adult. Since many-sidedness\ndepends on reflection for its full solidity, the child can also only\never approximate adult versatility and virtue (PS I: 149). For\nHerbart, the teacher promotes reflection by promoting what he calls\nthe child\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d (Interesse). Now,\nthe child\u2019s natural engrossment in its activities must be\nrespected as symbols of its individuality. At the same time,\nengrossment is a kind of seclusion, whereas interest is an opening up\nof the person in and to the \nworld.[72]\n Step by step, the teacher must lead the\npupil to become an interested, active learner, who desires not to\npossess knowledge, but to hover \u201cbetween merely\nspectating [on the one hand] and grasping [on the other]\u201d\n(cf. SW II: 42).\nThe first phase of interest is noticing objects:\n\nthe noticed object not only stands forth for a\ncertain duration from the flow of psychic activity, but also aids the\nreproduction of suppressed representations. (Weiss 1928: 194; cf. SW\nII: 42; 53)\n\n As other representations rise, new, imagined\nrepresentations are anticipated (as we saw frequently happens in\napperception). Should an imagined representation be perfectly\nrepresented, it will naturally provoke an aesthetic judgment of\napproval. This leads to a \u201cdemand\u201d for the imagined\nobject, i.e., an overpowering sense for its realization; and this\ndemand finally expresses itself in action in the world (SW II:\n42\u20133). It is thus clear that by \u201ccultivating\ninterest\u201d, Herbart does not mean simply getting the pupil\n\u201cto be interested in something\u201d. Rather, as these four\nphases of interest map onto the phases of engrossment and reflection,\ninterest is an expression of many-sidedness, namely its activity in\nthe world. For \u201cdemand\u201d here is not simply a strong\ndesire, but an apperceptive \u201cmental anticipation\u201d of the\nobject\u2019s realization. As such it is necessary for the pupil to\nadvance to a more perfect state of systematic and aesthetic\ncompleteness.[73]\n Thus by promoting interest and\nmany-sidedness, education primes the pupil for action (PS:\n181).[74]\nThus far, \u201cinterest\u201d has remained quite abstract: it\nis, in nuce, a questing openness towards certain objects,\nleading to action. Now the kind of action Herbart has in mind is not\nan instinctive reaction, but is integrated into a systematic plan. For\nthe totality of \u201cthe interesting\u201d is prescribed by\nculture,[75]\nand its divisions into the cultural and natural sciences (SW II: 44,\nf.).  Education must accordingly pursue in parallel the formation of\nthe pupil\u2019s imagination and understanding (PS I: 59; cf. 181).\nBecause all knowledge is rooted in experience, organized through\nspeculation, and grasped as a whole aesthetically, Bildung\nmust develop these three dimensions equally (SW II: 53). Equally\nimportant, however, is the pupil\u2019s constant, active\nparticipation in his surroundings, in order to develop an empathic\nunderstanding of her fellow human beings (PS I: 156; SW II: 51,\nff.). In all these cases, a teacher is needed to modify experience and\nhuman interaction in order to maximize the yield of knowledge. For\nexperience merely accumulates random representations;\ninstruction helps the person to analyze, organize and combine\nthese \u201cformless fragments\u201d (Weiss 1928:\n 200).[76]\n By the same token,\nmere everyday contact with others does not produce empathy.\nHence, the teacher must not be narrowly committed to his scientific\nexpertise, but demonstrate interest in the world and human beings (SW\nII: 50). While native taste and thoughtfulness cannot be taught, the\nteacher must be alert to these and fan such sparks in order\nto complete what nature has prepared (SW II: 46). Further, he\nmust respect the \u201cpersonal unity\u201d of the child:\nHerbart\u2019s rule:\n\nto give equal right to engrossment and reflection\nin every in area of inquiry, no matter how small; i.e., to tend in\norder to: clarity of the particular; association of\nthe many; coordination of what has been associated, as well\nas practice in progressing through this organization.\n\n In all this, the elements of\ninstruction\u2014\u201cfacts, information, ideas,\nknowledge\u201d\u2014are not negligible, but rather\n\nvitally important, for \u2026 they become built\nup into \u201capperception masses\u201d, which, in the process of\ntaking in more facts, information, ideas, knowledge, give\nrise to \u201capperceptive interest\u201d, this latter being itself\nof first importance in the character-forming process. (Hayward 1907:\n70)\n5.2 Character\nWe have so far been discussing the ideal of the many-sidedness; the\nmany-sided person and the person of character is one and the same,\nthough regarded from different perspectives (PS I: 199; SW II: 89; cf.\nSW IV, esp. \u201cP\u00e4dagogisches Gutachten usw.\u201d:\n519, ff). Herbart is particularly concerned with moral\ncharacter, and its virtues of stability, hardness\n(H\u00e4rte), and invulnerability. He wants to show that a\nmany-sided interest serves moral character, and how pedagogy devoted\nto the former contributes to moral education (Weiss 1928: 211). For\nHerbart, (moral) character, like all spiritual (geistig)\naspects of human life, is not a natural given, but a gradual\nacquisition. Psychologically speaking, it is the will that in the\nyoung child is stamped through repeated interaction with the outer\nworld, settling into \u201cuniform and stable [ways] in which [it\npursues] certain goals while excluding others\u201d; thus, the will\nbecomes character (Weiss 1928: 211; cf. SW II: 90).\nCharacter has distinct objective and subjective sides (SW II:\n90\u20131).  Objectively, character depends on the child\u2019s\nsusceptibility to formation and its individuality. Although the child\nis not born with \u201ca\u201d character (which term is reserved for\nsettled traits), yet he is born with certain dispositions, including a\n\u201cdisposition to stability of character\u201d (SW II: 91). This\nmanifests itself in what Herbart calls the will\u2019s\n\u201cmemory\u201d, i.e., the fact that under like stimuli, the will\nwill will like actions (SW II: 91\u20132). In this respect, there\nseems to be something predictable, hence \u201cobjective\u201d in\nhuman character. Although this stability is but relative, and one\nspontaneously finds himself choosing or forsaking, avoiding this or\npursuing that, yet\n\n\nwhere there is a memory of the will, the choice [in a given situation]\nwill be made of itself. The preponderance of wishes will involuntarily\norganize itself [and manifests itself in] choice. (SW II: 92; SW\nV: 203)\nIn different individuals, their inclinations and naturally\ndiffering intensity will cause the stability of simple willing to\nvary: \u201cevery individuality is and remains a chameleon\u201d (SW\nII: 93). Nonetheless, they originate in a \u201cunified source and\npoint of reference\u201d that constitutes the \u201cessential core\nof individuality\u201d (Weiss 1928: 213). Hence while choice only\noccurs in accordance with an individual, particular standard, it\nremains the precondition for the consolidation of character itself. It\nis out of simple willing and the psychological character to which it\ngradually gives rise that the \u201cmatter\u201d is gathered, as it\nwere, with which one has to work, and from which he ultimately\n\u201cmust secure the demands that he makes of himself\u201d:\n\u201cBeing is what gets a person started; demands follow\nafter\u201d (PS I: 198).\nOn the other hand, these demands typify the higher, subjective\naspect of character, \u201chigher\u201d because marked by reflective\nintelligence, an apperceptive distinction between willing and the\nobjects of will, between I and not-I. Thus the ego now identifies the\nnatural or simple will as its \u201cown\u201d will: the natural\nstability of the simple will becomes a willed or conscious stability.\nIn addition, the reflective effort to grasp oneself leads to\na demand regarding the objects towards\nwhich conscious willing is directed. That is, the will must\nadapt itself to changes in the object: it perceives a demand\nthat one must \u201cprecisely orient oneself in view of\ncircumstances\u201d, and to do so differently as circumstances\nshift. Hence the stability of character must be tempered with\nflexibility (Motivit\u00e4t); in the \u201cprecision of this\nflexibility lies the art of characterful living\u201d (PS I:\n201; 351, f.; cf. esp. 198).  Individual willing settles into\ncharacter through the struggle that arises in the individual\u2019s\nattempt to defend the ego and the will\u2019s stability. Because the\nstability of character is only relative, and shifts over the years,\nits true principle can only consist in being oriented towards\na realm of purposes (Zwecke) or ultimate values\n(Werte) (Weiss 1928: 216).\n5.3 Ethical aspect of character\n\nTo bring it about that the pupil finds himself, as\nchoosing the good, as rejecting the evil: this\u2014or\nnothing\u2014is character-formation! (SW I: 261)\n\n Character has an ineluctably ethical aspect: we\nwant (our) character not to be of just any sort, but good. Like\nAristotle, Herbart holds that we always stand in some relation to virtue\nand vice. While not by nature good or bad, our actions and character\nnecessarily fall somewhere on the spectrum of virtue and vice. Virtue\nis thus not something attached from the outside to an ethically\nneutral self; rather, it is a natural quality of man that will develop\nwell or poorly. So Herbart, like Aristotle and Plato, does not think\nthat education should aim to inculcate moral truths or commandments,\nso much as lead the \u201cmoral[ly constituted human being]\nto recognize his own value and dignity, and [then] to elevate\nit\u201d (PS I: 199). Here again we see the transition from the\nobjective facticity of one\u2019s constitution as a being\nwith some moral charge, to the subjective endorsement of it,\nof accepting responsibility for the excellence of one\u2019s moral\nconstitution as the source of one\u2019s value and dignity. It is a\nmovement of \u201cawakening self-reflection\u201d, in which the\nform-law governing our involuntary (aesthetic) approval or disapproval\nof human actions or situations is elevated to norm-law, i.e., is\naccepted as binding on me, and to which I have a responsibility that I\naccept (cf. Weiss 1928: 216).\nAs with character generally, moral character displays a kind of\nnatural memory, a \u201cperduring in simple willing [,] the natural\nbeginning of unity and consistency of moral willing\u201d, already\nevident in the small child\u2019s incipient moral feeling (PS I: 199;\ncf. SW II: 120\u20131). All this points to the fact that in the\nobjective or natural constitution of character, we already find\n\u201cconceptions of the good and right\u201d. This natural moral\nmemory shows itself in the fact that\n\nmoral judgment as the pure natural appearance of\nthe essence of humanity is not \u201cobscure\u201d and\n\u201cmutable\u201d, but [always] \u201cdecisive\u201d, that it\nalways appears as the same willing whenever the same stimulus is\nrenewed and nothing hinders or neutralizes a pure conception of the\nobject, [i.e.,] whenever the mind is in a state of pure\ncontemplation. (Weiss 1928: 217; cf. esp. PS I: 131)\nThis consistent, disinterested willing just is the phenomenon of\nconscience, which thus reveals itself as a form of willing, namely the\nnatural desire for the good as neutrally judged. As will, conscience,\ntoo, has an object, namely the moral ideal, i.e., its own relation to\nother wills. As we saw in our discussion of Herbart\u2019s ethics,\n\n[t]he judged [thing, sc. judged by\n\u201cconscience\u201d] is also [the] will, [only in this case] the\nwill in its relation to other wills (PS I: 202)\n\n Conscience as \u201cnatural\u201d or\n\u201cobjective\u201d will thus articulates the (moral) demands\nthat the human being makes of himself, the pursuit of which\ndetermines his moral character, now properly so\ncalled. Self-reflection at first notices objective as well as\nsubjective willing, but when the object has been completely\nrepresented, viz., the individual will as a member\nor relatum of a will-relation, then this complete\nrepresentation of the object also provokes approval or disapproval as an immediate\n\u201caesthetic\u201d effect . In other\nwords, the individual goes beyond merely registering how he feels or\nfinds himself, to positively approving or censuring that same inner\nstate.\nWe see here a special case of apperception as an interaction among\nconflicting representational masses, in which one representational\ngroup is not only \u201cnoticed\u201d but evaluated by another, held\nto what (from its perspective) is perceived as an alien claim. Now, on\nthe one hand, since the soul is postulated as a unity, the difference\nbetween how one is, and how one judges that one ought to\nbe, indicates an inner conflict. On the other hand, the moral\npersonality, as a manifestation of the integral soul, must or ought\nalso to be integrated. In short, the conflict must be resolved so that\nthe judged will is brought into agreement with the aesthetic\n(apperceiving, evaluating) will, and so \u201cmerge into a single\nperson\u201d: \u201c[T]his person represents the ideal of an\nethically self-determining will\u201d (PS I: 202; cf. 131). But since\nthis ideal is rarely if ever achieved, we constantly feel compelled to\n\u201cinterrupt our activity and alter our mental disposition from\nwithin\u201d. Thus, for the sake of the unity of the moral\npersonality, the human takes as a categorical imperative what\npreviously was but an aesthetic judgment.\nNow it is a presupposition of pedagogy that all human beings are\ncapable of living up to the ideal of an integrated, unified,\nautonomous personality (PS I: 202; 93). But how does the will become\ndecisive? In other words, how do we gain a moral character\nthat acts for the good? We may approach this problem by\nasking how those natures that successfully form themselves do so, and\nthrough what stages they must pass in \u201cgaining a\ncharacter\u201d (Weiss 1928: 221\u20132). This can help the\npedagogue develop a plan for optimizing what is otherwise a haphazard\nprocess. The resolute character depends, first, upon a\nmoral eros, and striving towards a representation. The will\ngenerates the act out of a desire (PS I: 360). But active deeds in\nturn depend on natural disposition\u2014including bodily health; the\nwill\u2019s memory; and the spirit\u2019s mobility or\n\u201cflexibility\u201d (PS I: 365). The less motile the spirit,\nthe firmer the will (PS I: 365;\n198).[77] Now\nnatural disposition develops very slowly and only fully matures in\nadults when they enter the world. Hence character-education has\nlittle latitude, since children rarely are placed in situations of\ntrue responsibility. At just the moment when the young adult takes up\nresponsibilities, his receptivity for education is exhausted (SW II:\n88, f.; PS I: 364).\nHerbart draws two conclusions: First, that character-formation must\nfocus on the young person\u2019s \u201csphere of desire\n[Begehrungskreis]\u201d, as the one aspect of character\napparently susceptible to \u201ca lasting influence\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 224). And since desires aim at goals, and goals are\nrepresentations, the educator can set to work upon the \u201csphere\nof representations\u201d, and thus shape the ultimate targets for the\nmature individual\u2019s future desire (SW II: 118, f.). Second,\nHerbart concludes that character-development gains stability and\nsecurity by being accelerated and integrated into the actual period\nand process of education. The teacher must keep in mind that character\n\u201cis solely formed through action out of one\u2019s own\nwill\u201d (PS I: 251). Therefore, Herbart\u2019s pedagogy\nemphasizes the importance of offering the child\u2019s will ample\nopportunity to express itself: \u201cBoys and youths must\nbe dared to become men\u201d (\u201cMa\u00dfregeln der\nKinderregierung\u201d; Herbart 1887b: 17). It is the work itself\nthat fixes the bounds of thought and action, not the teacher; within\nthose bounds the student is to be given maximal freedom (PS I:\n308). By frequently exercising the freedom of the will in purposeful\nactivity, the pedagogue is able to \u201charden\u201d the\npupil\u2019s will (PS I: 368\u20139).\nWe began by asking how moral character is to be formed. This\nquestion finally calls for consideration of the \u201cinfluences\nthat specially affect the moral features of character\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 225). Chief among these is aesthetic judgment, which must\ntherefore be constantly exercised, so as to become the power\nmastering desires. The pedagogue must therefore carefully attend to\nthe contents of the child\u2019s or sphere of thoughts. First, the\npupil should gain a clear and particularized familiarity with a\n\u201cwhole series of moral elements and their most common causes in\nlife\u201d, e.g., the main relationships of daily life, family,\ncountry, and their various conflicts and contradictions. Further,\nsince character ultimately depends on the integration of the person,\nall domains of human interest must be brought into relation with the\nideal: thus, for Herbart as for\nMontaigne,[78]\n history in the broadest sense provides an\nindispensable space in which to exercise the young person\u2019s\naesthetic and practical judgment. Since passive presentation of\nhistorical, literary, or philosophical pictures must be\navoided, the instructor must strive to bring peoples and persons of\nthe past to the fore as living people: practice in\nrecognizing many human types sharpens the pupil\u2019s\n\u201cethical eye\u201d, securing the child from dangerous\nsurprises in life (SW II: 50). Again, because historical figures\nappear at a distance, the pupil can contemplate them in a\ndisinterested fashion, letting \u201cpure taste\u201d rule action\nin his imagination. Such training is the best one can do in preparing\nthe person for adulthood.",
