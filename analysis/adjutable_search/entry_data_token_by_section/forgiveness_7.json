    "main_text": "Standing to Forgive\n4. Standing to Forgive\n\nIt is standard to assume that not just anyone can forgive a wrongdoer\nfor a certain wrong. One must have \u201cstanding\u201d. If I\nlack standing, then forgiving is not on the table for me; I\nam not a candidate for forgiving. And so to doubt whether someone has\nstanding to forgive is not to doubt whether someone succeeded in\nforgiving. Nor is it to doubt whether someone\u2019s forgiveness was\nmorally good, right or permissible. Rather, it is to doubt whether\nthat person can forgive in the first place.\n\nWho has standing to forgive? It might be thought that one has standing\nonly if one is the victim of wrongdoing (in some sense of\n\u2018victim\u2019). Jeffrie Murphy expresses such a view when he\nsays that \n\n\nI do not have standing to resent or forgive you unless I have\nmyself been the victim of your wrongdoing. I may forgive you for\nembezzling my funds; but it would be ludicrous for me, for example, to\nclaim that I had decided to forgive Hitler for what he did to the\nJews. I lack the proper standing for this. Thus, I may legitimately\nresent (and hence consider forgiving) only wrong done to me.\n(Murphy & Hampton 1988: 21, emphasis original) \n\n\nOn this view, only those who have been directly wronged have standing\nto forgive. Suppose Alfred lies to Betty. Betty is thereby directly\nwronged by Alfred. Though we will not attempt a full account of what\nit means to be directly wronged by someone, the general idea is that\nfor Betty to be directly wronged by Alfred means that Alfred\u2019s\nconduct itself constituted a wrong against Betty; he failed Betty,\nmorally speaking. Betty therefore has direct standing to forgive.\n\nSuppose, however, that Alfred lies to Betty and this results in Betty\nbeing very late in picking up her brother Todd. Alfred did not lie to\nTodd, but by lying to Betty, there is a straightforward sense\nin which this resulted in a wrong being done to Todd. Here, while we\ncan say that Betty was directly wronged and so has direct standing to\nforgive, it is not true that Todd was directly wronged by Alfred.\nRather, it was something Alfred did to Betty that led to Todd\u2019s\nbeing wronged indirectly. And because it would be fitting for\nTodd to blame Alfred, and for Alfred to apologize to Todd, it is\nplausible to think that Todd also has standing to forgive Alfred. Call\nthis indirect standing.\n\nThough controversial, it may be possible to have standing to forgive\nwhile lacking either direct or indirect standing. Such standing is\nimplicated in cases where one person forgives on behalf of\nsomeone else who has or would have had direct or indirect standing.\nSuppose Ted\u2019s adult daughter Maria is assaulted and left unable\nto communicate for the rest of her life. Supposing that Maria has\ndirect standing to forgive her assailant, if it is possible for Ted to\nforgive the assailant on behalf of Maria, he is able to do so in\nvirtue of possessing what we may call proxy standing.\n\nFinally, consider third-party standing. What is labeled\n\u201cthird-party\u201d forgiveness in the forgiveness literature is\noften a source of confusion. Charles Griswold rightly points out that\nsome kinds of cases of standing are misleadingly called\n\u201cthird-party\u201d. For example, he asks us to imagine a case\nin which the murder of a loved one injures us, and the matter of\nwhether to forgive presents itself to us in light of the loss\nwe\u2019ve sustained. \u201cThis sort of case\u201d, he says,\n\u201cis not a matter of third-party forgiveness\u201d (2007: 117).\nThe standing to forgive that would accrue to such a person, Griswold\nsays, would be (to put it in our above terminology) of the direct or\nindirect variety, depending on how the case is fleshed out.\nGriswold\u2019s own view of the matter is that third-party\nforgiveness involves \n\n\na situation in which the question of forgiveness arises in light of\nyour indignation at the loss suffered by another person, thanks to\nsomeone else\u2019s actions: here the matter concerns your forgiving\ntheir offender on their behalf for the harm done to them (not to you).\n(2007: 117) \n\n\nYet because Griswold has in mind an activity that involves forgiving\n\u201con behalf\u201d of the victim, this kind of standing to\nforgive might be best thought of as proxy standing. Indeed, he argues\nthat in order to engage in what he calls third-party\nforgiveness, the forgiver can only do so if she has\n\u201cstanding\u201d, and one receives such standing only if one has\nan \u201cidentification with the victim\u201d (119).\n\nWe identify as third-party standing what both Glen Pettigrove (2009)\nand Margaret Urban Walker (2013) have in mind in their recent\ndiscussions of third-party forgiveness. Such cases, Walker writes,\ninvolve \n\n\nthe scenario in which A forgives the offender B for\nsomething B did to the victim C, where A is not\nplausibly seen as a fellow victim, and where A forgives\nB on A\u2019s own behalf, not on behalf of C or\nanyone else who might be a victim of the wrong. (2013: 495) \n\n\nSuch a putative forgiver, she says, is one who \u201csuffered no\nwrong\u201d by the offender\u2019s actions (2013: 496). This\nputative standing to forgive, therefore, is not reducible to any of\nthe aforementioned varieties: the forgiver was not wronged by the\noffender (directly or indirectly), she does not forgive herself, and\nshe does not forgive on behalf of anyone else.\n",
