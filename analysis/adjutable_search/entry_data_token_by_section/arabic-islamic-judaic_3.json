    "main_text": "al-Farabi\n4. al-Farabi\n\nThe \u2018influence\u2019 of the Arabic \u201csecond Master\u201d\n(i.e. the second Aristotle), Abu Nasr al-Farabi (870-950), is evident\nin many fields of Medieval Jewish philosophy: epistemology, logic,\nmetaphysics and theology, ethics, and even physics.\n\nAs for epistemology, al-Farabi\u2019s major work on it, the\nEnumeration of Sciences (Ihsa\u2019\nal-\u2018ulum), about the general contents of linguistics,\nlogic, mathematical sciences, physics and metaphysics, ethics and even\nIslamic jurisprudence and religion, exerted an important influence\nover a number of Jewish scholars in the period 1200\u20131400. Joseph\nben Judah Ibn \u2018Aqnin (d. 1226), a Moroccan Jewish follower of\nMaimonides, inserted long sections of the original Arabic text in\nchapter 27 of his main ethical work, The Medicine of Souls\n(Tibb al-nufus); in his commentary on the Song of\nSongs, The Revealing of Secrets (Inkishaf\nal-asrar), he quoted a number of other Farabian works on\nepistemology, logic, metaphysics, and even music. Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera inserted a number of its passages (in Hebrew) into his own\n\u201cenumeration of sciences\u201d, part two of the Beginning\nof Science (Reshit hokhmah), probably written around\n1250 (Efros 1935; Strauss 1936; about Falaquera\u2019s knowledge of\nal-Farabi\u2019s works, see Harvey 2002). Qalonymos ben Qalonymos\ntranslated the whole work into Hebrew in 1314, together with another\nshort \u201cintroduction to Aristotle\u201d by al-Farabi himself;\nrather significantly, he himself inserted into it his own treatment of\nsome subjects which were lacking in the original Arabic text, very\nprobably since al-Farabi rejected them as real sciences: medicine,\nalchemy, magic. Qalonymos\u2019 version was later quoted by some\nJewish scholars, mainly during the 14th and 15th\ncenturies. As far as philosophy in general is concerned, it should be\nnoted that Falaquera made a sort of complete Hebrew abridgement of\nthree main works by al-Farabi, and inserted them into part three of\nthe Beginning of Science: the Attainment of\nHappiness (Tahsil al-sa\u2018ada), the Philosophy\nof Plato (Falsafa Aflatun) and the Philosophy of\nAristotle (Falsafa Aristu), so spreading among Jews the\nknowledge of the general contents of all works by Plato and Aristotle\n(Strauss 1936; see also Mahdi 1962). Falaquera also quoted a short\nintroductory passage of al-Farabi\u2019s Epistle On the Knowledge\nof Philosophy in his Book of Degrees (as pointed out in\nChiesa and Rigo 1993).\n\nAs for logic, al-Farabi even exerted a stronger influence over\nMedieval Jewish philosophy, which was apparently almost like that\nexerted by the most highly reputed, \u201cofficial\u201d commentator\nof Aristotelian logic: Averroes. According to Maimonides, there was no\nneed to study logical texts, apart from those by al-Farabi, since\n\u201call that he wrote\u2026 is full of wisdom, and\u2026 he was\na very valid author\u201d (Marx 1934\u20131935, 379). Surely,\nal-Farabi\u2019s logical (and also non-logical) works influenced the\nTreatise On the Art of Logic (Maqala fi sina\u2018a\nal-mantiq) usually ascribed to Maimonides, and probably written\naround 1160 (see Brague 1996; Maimonides\u2019 authorship has been\nrecently challenged by Davidson 2005, 313\u2013322): this text was\nthrice translated into Hebrew in the 13th and\n14th centuries and was obviously widespread among Jewish\nreaders in the Late Middle Ages. As a matter of fact, almost all his\nlogical works were either translated into Hebrew, or at least widely\nemployed by a number of Medieval Jewish philosophers in the\n13th-15th centuries (among the others, by Samuel\nIbn Tibbon in his Commentary on the Difficult Terms\n[Perush ha-millot ha-zarot]: Robinson 2009), although the\nreal extent of his influence on Jewish logic has not yet been examined\nin all its aspects. As for the many Hebrew translations of his\nsummaries or \u201cshort commentaries\u201d on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and Aristotle\u2019s Organon, probably five\ngroups of these translations (not covering the whole series of the\nsummaries) can be identified: some translations were made very early,\npossibly before 1200; some others should be ascribed to a Spanish Jew,\nMoses Ibn Lagis; some others were made by members of the family of the\nIbn Tibbons, during the 13th century, and were often\nemployed as sources by some 14th- and\n15th-centuries Jewish philosophers (Judah ben Isaac Cohen,\nAbraham Avigdor); other translations consisted in revisions of the\nTibbonian ones, were made before 1320 and were surely known to\nHezekiah bar Halafta (see below, 7); finally, two translations (the\nonly ones of al-Farabi\u2019s summaries of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric and Poetics) were probably made by Todros\nTodrosi, a philosophical translator working in Arles, around 1330\n(about all these translations, see Zonta 1996, 189\u2013193). In\nparticular, al-Farabi\u2019s summary of the Categories was\nquoted and commented on by an otherwise unknown Jewish philosopher,\nSar Shalom, possibly active in Provence around 1300 (Zonta 1997b,\n523). Also some of al-Farabi\u2019s \u201clong commentaries\u201d\n(tafasir) on Aristotle\u2019s logic, even those now lost in\ntheir Arabic original text, can be shown to have influenced Jewish\nphilosophers: the Long Commentary on Categories is preserved\nalmost only due to the many quotations made by a Late Medieval Jewish\nauthor, Judah ben Isaac Cohen, and has very recently been published\n(Zonta 2006a); the Long Commentary on De interpretatione,\nfound in Arabic, was translated into Hebrew before 1334 (the text of\nits introduction in Hebrew is still extant) and appears to have\ninfluenced Gersonides too (Glasner 2002, 252\u2013254); many passages\nfrom the Long Commentary on Book Eight of Topics, lost in\nArabic, were translated into Hebrew by Todros Todrosi in 1334. As\nproved by Georges Vajda (Vajda 1965), Maimonides knew and implicitely\nemployed al-Farabi\u2019s summary of Topics, book one,\nchapter 11, as a source of a passage of his Guide of the\nPerplexed, part two, chapter 25, concerning a discussion between\nthe two different doctrines of the eternity of the world according to\nAristotle and Plato; he also knew and paraphrased some passages from\nother logical works by al-Farabi (the summary of De\ninterpretatione, the Long Commentary on Prior Analytics:\nsee Davidson 2005, 113\u2013114).\n\nAs for al-Farabi\u2019s most famous work, the Book of the\nOpinions of the People of the Virtuous City (Kitab ara\u2019\nahl al-madina al-fadila), apart from some short quotations found\nin Moses Ibn Ezra\u2019s Treatise of the Garden (Fenton\n1976, 297) and in Isaac Ibn Latif\u2019s above mentioned work (Chiesa\n1986, 80), the most relevant employment of this text as a source for\nmetaphysics and theology is found in Falaquera\u2019s Book of\nDegrees and in particular in book ten of his encyclopedia The\nOpinions of the Philosophers, where his general treatment of the\nnature of God mixed up al-Farabi\u2019s and Averroes\u2019 opinions\nabout it (Chiesa 1986, 81\u201384). Al-Farabi\u2019s Virtuous\nCity appears to have been ignored by most of Medieval Jewish\nphilosophers: as a matter of fact, Moses Ibn Tibbon did not translate\nit into Hebrew, but preferred to translate al-Farabi\u2019s The\nPolitical Regimen (al-Siyasa al-madaniyya) instead\n(Steinschneider 1893, 290\u2013292) \u2013 another Farabian text\nknown and quoted by Falaquera (Plessner 1956, 189\u2013193).\nAccording to Pines, although al-Farabi\u2019s former work is not\nexplicitely quoted in the Guide of the Perplexed, it was\nsurely among the main sources of Maimonides\u2019 doctrine about the\ndifferent roles played by the philosopher and by the prophet (see\nMoses Maimonides 1962, 1:lxxxvii-xcii). Al-Farabi\u2019s idea about\nthe relationship between philosophy and religion, according to which\nthe former is in a substantially higher position with respect to the\nlatter, as found in his Book on Letters (Kitab\nal-huruf) and Book on Religion (Kitab\nal-milla), strongly influenced Maimonides\u2019 ideas about this\n(see Berman 1974); moreover, the Book on Letters was later\nemployed as a source for Falaquera\u2019s treatment of linguistics in\nhis Beginning of Science. According to Davidson, Maimonides\nexplicitly quoted and employed al-Farabi\u2019s Political\nRegime under the title The Changing Beings\n(al-Mawjudat al-mutaghayyira) for discussing the question of\nthe world\u2019s eternity in part two, chapter 74, of the\nGuide (Davidson 2005, 113). It should be noted that European\nJewish philosophers active in the 13th and 14th\ncenturies show even more interest in another work by al-Farabi: his\ntreatise On the Intellect (Risala fi l-\u2018aql).\nThis interest was apparently raised by Maimonides, who quoted and\ncommented on some passages of this book about the theologians\u2019\nidea of the human intellect and the role of the active intellect in\nhis Guide (see what has been written by Pines in Moses\nMaimonides 1962, 1:lxxxii-lxxxiii). As recently shown by Gad\nFreudenthal, at least three Arabic-into-Hebrew versions of the work\n(one by Qalonymos ben Qalonymos, and two anonymous) were written, read\nand in one case at least commented on in Western Europe between about\n1150 and 1320 (Freudenthal 2003). Moreover, Farabian doctrines (if not\ndirect references to al-Farabi\u2019s works) about some key concepts\nof metaphysics and theology (the First Cause, the prophecy, etc.) were\nstill circulating in Spain around 1350 (see Vajda 1962, 216\u2013217,\nwhere these doctrines are found in Joseph Ibn Waqqar\u2019s work).\n\n\nAs for ethics, the first traces of al-Farabi\u2019s doctrine about\nthe difference between the philosophers and inferior classes of men\nare found in Abraham bar Hiyya (Vajda 1938). However,\nal-Farabi\u2019s affirmation, as found in his lost commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, about human moral\nperfection and its connection to an intellectual perfection apparently\nlimited to man\u2019s life in this world seems to have influenced\nMaimonides\u2019 idea of perfection as found in part three, chapter\n18, of the Guide of the Perplexed (Moses Maimonides 1962,\n1:lxxix-lxxxii; Davidson 2005, 113). Other ethical works by al-Farabi,\nthe Epistle of the Guide to the Way of Happiness (Risala\nfi l-tanbih \u2018ala sabil al-sa\u2018ada) and the\nSelected Aphorisms (Fusul muntaza\u2018a), were\nalso both translated into Hebrew, probably around 1300, and quoted by\nsome Jewish philosophers: Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (Plessner 1956,\n179\u2013183), Qalonymos ben Qalonymos, Josef Ibn \u2018Aqnin\n(Steinschneider 1893, 290\u2013292).\n\nAccording to Yair Shiffman, a lost work by al-Farabi on physics, his\nLong Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics, was also\nimplicitly quoted by Falaquera in his Guide to the Guide\n(Moreh ha-Moreh), a philosophical commentary on\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide written in 1280 (Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera 2001, 234); as a matter of fact, a passage of it about the\nformal and material differences between the heavens and the stars is\nexplicitly quoted and commented on by Maimonides himself in chapter 19\nof part two of the Guide of the Perplexed (see Moses\nMaimonides 1962, 2:239).\n",
