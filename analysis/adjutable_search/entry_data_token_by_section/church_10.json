    "main_text": "Applications of the Logistic Method || Against Logical Empiricism\n3.1 Against Logical Empiricism\n\nChurch was never a member of the Vienna Circle and neither were Kleene\nnor Rosser (an ocean separated them from Vienna); nor did they show\nparticular sympathy for the Circle and its aims. Church was, however,\nappreciative of the work of Carnap in particular (cf. Church\u2019s\n[1939a] review of Carnap\u2019s Foundations of Logic and\nMathematics [1939]). But commenting on Carnap\u2019s\nCircle-inspired view that the sole task of philosophy is semantical\nanalysis, Church remarked that this \u201crepresents an extreme\nview\u201d (1943a). Church adds that, nonetheless, the importance of\nsemantical investigations to philosophy should not be\nunderestimated.\n\nThus, Church was among those logicians and philosophers who did\nnot subscribe to the Circle\u2019s approach to the question\nof meaning. This, of course, is not to deny that the Circle was a\npowerful force in the development of analytic philosophy (see the\nentry on\n logical empiricism).\n But Church and many of his students did not participate in the\nCircle.\n\nThe logical empiricists tried to explicate the notion of empirical\nverification in terms of logical entailment. We begin with their\nsecond attempt, an explication known as \u201cweak\nverifiability\u201d, which (like its predecessor, \u201cstrong\nverifiability\u201d) was framed in terms of logical entailment or\nlogical deducibility:\n\n\nS is empirically verifiable iff S logically entails\nA1, A2\u2026,\n\n\n(perhaps with the help of additional premises). More specifically, the\nform A. J. Ayer initially gave to this idea was as follows:\n\n\nIt is the mark of a genuine factual proposition\u2026that some\nexperiential [observation] propositions can be deduced from it in\nconjunction with certain other premises without being deducible from\nthese other premises alone (1936 [1952: 38\u201339]).\n\n\nFor example, from \u201cThis is a swan\u201d together with\n\u201cAll swans are white\u201d we can deduce \u201cThis is\nwhite\u201d although the latter cannot be deduced from \u201cAll\nswans are white\u201d alone. Thus, \u201cAll swans are white\u201d\ncounts as meaningful.\n\nBut this is obviously unacceptable and (as with its predecessor) it is\nproperties of logical entailment that cause the problem. To borrow\nAyer\u2019s own example (given in the second edition of his 1936\n[1952]), from \u201cThe Absolute is lazy\u201d together with\n\u201cIf the Absolute is lazy, then this is white\u201d, it follows\nthat \u201cThis is white\u201d, and this does not follow from the\nconditional premise alone. Hence, contrary to every bone in the\nlogical empiricist\u2019s body, \u201cThe Absolute is lazy\u201d is\nmeaningful. The argument can be redeployed to show that any sentence\nwhatsoever is meaningful.\n\nIn the second edition of Language, Truth, and Logic, Ayer\nattempted to remedy this problem. In a review, Church (1949a) roundly\nrefuted Ayer\u2019s proposal. This rebuttal sent verificationism and\nlogical empiricism itself into a tailspin. Carnap tried to rescue\nthese doctrines by adopting an approach not based directly on logical\nentailment but this effort was refuted by Kaplan (1975a). Despite\nthese difficulties, there is currently an intense revival of interest\nin the question of the empirical structure and content of scientific\ntheories and in Carnap\u2019s work in particular (see the entry on\n Rudolph Carnap).\n\nAyer\u2019s revised criterion of empirical verification is as\nfollows:\n\n\nS is directly verifiable iff either S is an\nobservation sentence or else S, perhaps in conjunction with\nother observation sentences A, B,\nC,\u2026, logically implies an observation sentence that is\nnot implied by A, B, C\u2026.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n\nS is indirectly verifiable if and only if\nS, perhaps in conjunction with other sentences P,\nQ, R,\u2026 logically implies a directly\nverifiable sentence D that is not implied by P,\nQ, R,\u2026. Furthermore, these sentences\nP, Q, R are each either analytic or\ndirectly verifiable.\n\n\nIn sum:\n\n\nA sentence is meaningful if and only if it is directly or indirectly\nverifiable, or else analytic.\n\n\nChurch argues as follows: Let \\(O1,\\) \\(O2,\\) and \\(O3\\) be\nindependent observation sentences (no one of them entails any other),\nand suppose \\(S\\) is any sentence whatsoever\u2014it might be\n\u201cThe Nothing Nots\u201d. Church shows that Ayer\u2019s\ndefinition entails that either \\(S\\) or its negation \u201cIt is not\nthe case that the Nothing Nots\u201d, is meaningful. For consider the\ndisjunctive sentence\n\n\n\\[ R: (\\nsim O1 \\cdot O2) \\lor (O3 \\cdot \\nsim S) \\]\n\n\n\\(R\\) together with \\(O1\\) entails the observation sentence \\(O3\\) and\nhence \\(R\\) is directly verifiable. Also, \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) entail\n\\(O2\\). This means that \\(S\\) is indirectly verifiable,\nunless \\(R\\) alone entails \\(O2\\). But if \\(R\\) alone entails\n\\(O2,\\) then its right hand disjunct alone entails \\(O2,\\) and hence\n\\(\\nsim S\\) is directly verifiable. So either \\(S\\) or \\(\\nsim S\\) is\nmeaningful and therefore many sentences that Ayer would reject as\nmeaningless are meaningful according to his definitions.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the foregoing argument may seem\nto depend crucially on a somewhat contested feature of classical\npropositional logic. The argument appeals to the principle that if \\(A\n\\lor B\\) logically entails \\(C\\), then \\(B\\) alone logically entails\n\\(C\\). But this in turn rests on the principle that \\(B\\) alone\nlogically entails \\(A \\lor B\\), for any \\(A\\), and this principle is\nrejected by so-called containment logics (for which see\n \u00a73.1 of the entry on connexive logic).\n However, it is possible to revise Church\u2019s argument so that it\nis compatible with containment-logical principles. So in fact\nChurch\u2019s argument is not in this way beholden to classical\nlogic.\n",
