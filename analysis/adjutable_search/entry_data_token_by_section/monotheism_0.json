Monotheism\u2019s Origins\n\n\nMost mainstream Old Testament scholars believe that the religion of\nthe early Israelites was neither monotheistic nor polytheistic but\n\u201cmonolatrous.\u201d While the existence of other gods was not\ndenied, Israel was to worship no god but Yahweh. In virtue of the\nMosaic covenant, Yahweh became the \u201cconfederate god\u201d of\nIsrael, and they become his people (Meek, 215). In part, this is\ncharacteristic of any \u201cnational religion: in practice only the\ngods of one\u2019s own nation are significant.\u201d Yet it was also\nunique, for \u201cone of the distinguishing characteristics of the\nIsraelite religion is the belief that there are not several gods of\nIsrael but only one, Yahweh, who claims exclusive devotion.\u201d\n(Ringgren, 67) There are no unambiguous assertions of monotheism from\nthe pre-exilic period, however. Even so, biblical scholars agree that\nthe religion of Israel was at least \u201cincipiently\u201d\nmonotheistic from its Mosaic beginnings. Why? Three things were\narguably decisive.\n\n\nIn the first place, \u201cwe encounter very early the idea that\nYahweh is the creator of heaven and earth.\u201d (Ringgren, 67).\nAlthough it is true that polytheistic religions frequently include a\ncreator in their pantheons, and these creators are often comparatively\nunimportant, there is a natural transition from the claim that a god\nhas created heaven and earth to the belief that he or she is\nlord of heaven and earth, and from there to monotheism. In the\nsecond place, there are \u201crepeated affirmations \u2026 that\nYahweh is the greatest and mightiest of the gods.\u201d (Ringgren, 99)\nFinally, the religion of Israel is unique in demanding exclusive\nworship; only Yahweh is to be worshiped by Israel. The extension of\nthis notion to the idea that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped by\neveryone is natural (although perhaps not inevitable). If\nthese considerations are correct, then the characteristics of Yahweh\nthat eventually led Israel to assert that Yahweh is the only God were\nhis creation of heaven and earth, his power and greatness, and his\nright to exclusive worship.\n\n\nParallel developments occurred elsewhere. Especially noteworthy is a\nphenomenon that sometimes occurs in polytheism, namely, that during\nworship the god is treated as if he or she were unlimited and supreme,\nand given epithets that properly belong to other members of the\npantheon. (This occurred at certain stages of Vedic polytheism, for\nexample.) More generally, the religious attitudes bound up with\ntheistic worship (whether monotheistic or polytheistic) appear\nto have a certain inner logic, tending to lead the devotee to magnify\nthe object of her devotion by denying limitations and adding\nperfections. The logical limit of this tendency is the ascription of\nsuch properties as universal sovereignty and unlimited power. The very\nsame attitudes also tend to lead her to unreservedly commit herself to,\nand center her life on, the god to whom she is devoted. It is therefore\nno accident that polytheistic systems often end up elevating one god or\nprinciple to the supreme position, and reinterpreting the others as its\nagents or manifestations; they become, in other words, essentially\nmonotheistic. This occurred, for example, both in late Paganism and in\nHinduism.\n\n\nA striking feature of these developments is that the ideas about the\nobject of worship which seem to have most directly led its devotees to\nexplicit affirmations of monotheism\u2014universal sovereignty,\nomnipotence, and a demand for total devotion\u2014are precisely\nthose underlying the three most powerful philosophical arguments for\nGod\u2019s unicity. We will discuss these shortly. But before doing so let\nus examine two historically important attempts to show that there can\u2019t\nbe two gods because nothing could distinguish them\u2014an argument\nfrom God\u2019s simplicity and another from his perfection.\n",
