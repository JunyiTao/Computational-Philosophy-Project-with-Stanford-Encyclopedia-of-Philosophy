As noted above, he\ntook Kant but not Hegel very seriously. He was largely self-taught in\nphilosophy of science. Among his contemporaries, he was familiar with\nPopper but not in any detail with the various strains of logical\npositivism and logical empiricism, in particular the positions of\nCarnap and Reichenbach. Apparently, he was only slightly acquainted\nwith the work of Bachelard while writing Structure, and they\nnever engaged in a fruitful interchange (Baltas et al. 2000, 284f).\nKuhn did acknowledge, in print and in his classes, the crucial\ninfluence on his historical and philosophical thinking of the two\nRussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, \u00c9mile Meyerson, author of\nIdentit\u00e9 et Realit\u00e9 (1908) and Alexandre\nKoyr\u00e9, especially his \u00c9tudes Galil\u00e9enes\n(1939), and that of Annaliese Maier, the German historian of medieval\nand early modern science. He had read Ludwik Fleck\u2019s Genesis\nand Development of a Scientific Fact (originally published in\nGerman in 1935) and Michael Polanyi\u2019s Personal\nKnowledge (1958) and had had some discussion with Polanyi (Baltas\net al. 2000, 296). Kuhn was also indebted to Wittgenstein, early\n(\u201cThe limits of my language are the limits of my world,\u201d\n1922, 148) and late (on language games and forms of life). (See\nSharrock and Read 2002, the introduction to Harris 2005, and Kindi\n2010 for Kuhn\u2019s relation to Wittgenstein and others.) He knew\nsomething of Toulmin\u2019s work.\n\nKuhn more than anyone in the Anglo-American world pointed out the need\nfor larger-sized units than individual theories in making sense of\nmodern science. Nonetheless, as we have seen, others in the Teutonic\nand Francophone worlds had previously postulated even larger\nsocio-intellectual units and correspondingly deeper changes than\nKuhn\u2019s, on somewhat different scales of intellectual space and\ntime. If we think of authors such as the Annales historian\nFernand Braudel, with his distinct time-scales, we recognize that the\nattribution of transformative change clearly depends heavily on the\nchoice of time-scale and on how fine- or course-grained is our\napproach. Hacking (2002, 76) makes this point with reference to the\nFrench context:\n\nThere are two extremes in French historiography. The Annales\nschool went in for long-term continuities or slow\ntransitions\u2014\u201cthe great silent motionless bases that\ntraditional history has covered with a thick layer of events\u201d\n(to quote from the first page of Foucault\u2019s 1969 Archeology\nof Knowledge). Foucault takes the opposite tack, inherited from\nGaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, and Louis Althusser. He posits\nsharp discontinuities in the history of knowledge.\n\n\nAlthough Kuhn emphasized the importance of skilled scientific\npractice, his paradigms remained closer to the articulate surface of\nscientific culture than Foucault\u2019s discursive formations, which\nare better located in the unconscious than in the Kuhnian\nsubconscious. Foucault does not speak of revolution.\n",
