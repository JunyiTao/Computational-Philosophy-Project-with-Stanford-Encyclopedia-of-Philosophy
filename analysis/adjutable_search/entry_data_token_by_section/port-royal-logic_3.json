    "main_text": "Ideas\n4. Ideas\n\nIn the Logic, ideas are the basic terms, or elements, of the\nart of thinking,\n\n\n\u2026the reflections we can make on our ideas are perhaps the most\nimportant part of logic, since they are the foundation for everything\nelse. (I.1, 25)\n\n\nAll operations of the mind involve ideas. The Logic\ncharacterizes ideas in the Cartesian way. They are, in the first\nplace, individuated by their objects. Ideas are \u201cas it were the\nimages of things\u201d as Descartes wrote (Meditations,\nThird meditation [CSM II, 25]). The notion of an image is taken\ngenerally; some very important ideas, the idea of God for example, are\nnot acquired by sensory perception. The Logic takes pains to\nemphasize this aspect of rationalist philosophy Thinking about a thing\nrequires an idea that represents the thing. Because ideas are in this\nsense objective, i.e., of objects, they can be classified according to\nthe metaphysical classification of their objects. In the Cartesian\nmetaphysics of the Logic, there are three fundamental kinds\nof objects, substances, unchanging aspects of substances called\n\u201cattributes\u201d, and features that change over time called\n\u201cmodes\u201d. Although Arnauld elsewhere takes up metaphysical\nquestions about the relation between ideas and their objects, then are\nnot taken up here (see Nadler 1989).\n\nDescartes\u2019 contrast between ideas that are clear and distinct as\nopposed to ideas that are obscure and confused is central to the\nLogic. It is primarily concerned with the ways in which\nthought arrives at the truth; the epistemic status of the ideas with\nwhich one thinks is more basic than rules for proceeding from one\nthought to another (Gaukroger 1989, Nelson 2017). Although Descartes\nis usually read as considering the clarity and distinctness of an idea\nto be a psychological criterion external to the idea itself (but see\nLennon 2008: 137\u201348), the Logic agrees with Spinoza\nthat perceptions of unconfused, true ideas are known as such without\nrecourse to a criterion of the sort sought by ancient sceptics. A good\nexample of the employment of clarity and distinctness is provided by\nthe characterization of the attributes and modes of\nsubstances. Again following Descartes, according to the Logic\nan attribute is recognized by one\u2019s inability to distinctly\nperceive a substance if one of its attributes is excluded from it.\nExtension, for example, is an attribute of bodies. Bodies cannot be\ndistinctly perceived except as extended. A mode cannot be distinctly\nperceived except in relation to the substance of which it is a mode,\nbut substances can be distinctly perceived while some particular modes\nare excluded from them. A mind can be distinctly perceived without the\nthought of a particular pain, but that particular thought is only\nconfusedly perceived unless it is perceived as that mind\u2019s\nthought.\n\nCommunication with others requires that ideas be expressed with words.\nComplex thought and the accumulation of personal knowledge are also\nhardly possible without recourse to words. Thinking and expressing\nthought with words with insufficient care, however, are the main\nsources of error. Much thinking takes place with exclusive attention\nto words without regard for the ideas signified by those words. It is\nalso common for the association between words and ideas to drift in\nways that damage the coherence of thought. The priority of thought to\nlinguistic expressions is put in extreme terms.\n\n\nIf reflection on our thoughts never concerned anyone but ourselves, it\nwould be enough to examine them in themselves, unclothed in words or\nother signs. (Logic, 23)\n\n\nThis has the practical result that most disputes are verbal.\nDisagreement about clearly and distinctly ideas themselves is\nvirtually impossible. Careful assignment of words to ideas making use\nof explicit definitions when necessary minimizes disputes. This\nstresses the importance of precisely tracking how words are associated\nwith ideas (I.12, 62).\n\nNevertheless, it is practically impossible to do all one\u2019s\nthinking without words and other symbolic representations. And it\nwould also be tiresome in a philosophical treatise to repeatedly\nexplain whether the author is referring to words, or to the ideas for\nwhich they stand, or to both at once. The Logic depends on\nthe reader to use context to make the appropriate disambiguations.\n\nIdeas fall into classes that parallel the Cartesian ontology. Ideas of\nsubstances are conventionally associated with ideas of nouns and thus\nfurther associated with written and spoken words, which are themselves\nobjects of the word-ideas. Ideas of attributes and modes are\nassociated with abstract nouns such as \u201chardness\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d, as well as by adjectives such as\n\u201chard\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d (I.2, 30\u201331). Words\nthemselves signify objects only transitively, as it were, via ideas of\nwords and then ideas of objects. The Logic often takes the\nshortcut of writing as though words directly signify things. It\ndepends on the reader to keep the full chain of associations in mind.\nThe logical distinction between general terms and particular or\nsingular ones emerges from ideas of attributes and modes. As noted\nabove, these ideas are most distinct when conceived along with the\nidea of the substance on which they depend. When they are conceived\nwithout attention to their substance idea, they can represent\nadditional objects. This is illustrated with a geometrical\nexample.\n\nGeneral or abstract ideas are an important class of ideas are derived\nfrom ideas of particular things. Although everything that exists is\nsingular, ideas can represent more than one thing. The general idea of\na triangle represents all particular triangles. Next, proper nouns\nwhich indicate single individuals, such as \u201cSocrates\u201d,\n\u201cRome\u201d, \u201cBucephalus\u201d, are distinguished from\ncommon or appellative nouns such as \u201cman\u201d,\n\u201ccity\u201d, \u201chorse\u201d, which can indicate more than\none thing. Throughout the text, the authors call both universal ideas\nand common nouns \u201cgeneral terms.\u201d The mental process\nyielding the ideas associated with general terms is explained with a\ngeometrical example.\n\n\n\u2026 if I draw an equilateral triangle on a piece of paper, and if\nI concentrate on examining it on this paper along with all the\naccidental circumstances surrounding it, I shall have an idea of only\na single triangle. But if I ignore all the particular circumstances\nand focus on the thought that the triangle is a figure bounded by\nthree equal lines, the idea I form will, on the one hand, represent\nmore clearly the equality of the lines and, on the other, be able to\nrepresent all equilateral triangles. (I.5, 38)\n\n\nSimilarly, one can ignore the equality of the lines and have a more\nabstract idea representing all triangles. Ignoring the number of lines\nenables one to represent all plane figures, and so on. It is easy to\nsee how this works for ideas of modes such as red, loud, painful, etc.\nIt is noteworthy that the authors affirm that all existences are\nparticular. Their construal of abstract ideas and the words associated\nwith them constitutes a thoroughgoing nominalism about the\nsignification of abstract ideas and the words associated with\nthem.\n\nMedieval philosophers explained the significance of general terms by a\ncomplex theory of supposition (see Spade 1982). The Logic\ncondenses this framework so that the significance of general ideas has\ntwo aspects: the comprehension and the extension.\nThe comprehension consists in the set of attributes essential to the\nidea. For example, the comprehension of the idea\n\u201ctriangle\u201d includes the attributes extension, shape, three\nlines, three angles, etc. The extension of the idea consists in the\nparticular objects to which it applies, which includes \u201call the\ndifferent species of triangles\u201d (I.6, 39\u201340). Here the\nauthors confuse matters by trying to incorporate the traditional terms\n\u201cinferiors\u201d and \u201cspecies\u201d, taking the latter\nfor individual objects. Usually, however, they straightforwardly take\nthe extension of a general idea to be the individuals possessing the\nattributes in its comprehension. There are three key features of this\ntheory of signification. First, the comprehension rather than the\nextension is essential to the function of a general idea: one cannot\nremove an attribute without destroying it\u2014making it into a\ndifferent idea, whereas one can restrict its extension by applying it\nto only some of the objects that fall under it. Second, the\ncomprehension governs the extension: the set of attributes determines\nthe individuals in its extension. Finally, comprehensions and\nextensions are inversely related. In adding attributes to the\ncomprehension of an idea one restricts its extension. For example, the\ncomprehension of the idea \u201cmammal\u201d includes that of the\nidea \u201canimal\u201d so the extension of \u201canimal\u201d\nincludes that of \u201cmammal.\u201d The Logic implicitly\nassumes this principle throughout the text. In recognizing these two\nmodes of the signification of words\u2014both the comprehension of\nthe associated idea and the objects in the extension\u2014it replaces\nthe traditional distinction between incomplete and complete entities\nin the treatment of the signification of general terms.\n\nIt is tempting to interpret the Logic as providing a\nprecursor of contemporary semantic theories in which comprehension is\nlike meaning or Fregean sense and extension is like reference. The\ncomprehension of a term does usually determine the objects in its\nextension. It must be remembered, however that it is psychological\nideas and not words that have comprehensions. No ideas are identically\nshared among minds, so only in the case of innate ideas or complexes\nstrictly defined in terms of innate ideas can communication result in\nsomething like transmission of meanings in the modern sense. Hacking\n(1975) argues that seventeenth-century texts, including the\nLogic, are primarily concerned with mental discourse and do\nnot include a philosophy of language at all.\n\nMoving to linguistic terms and their association with ideas, the\nauthors first take up the noun system. This is mostly drawn from Part\nII of the Port-Royal Grammar. As explained in Part II of the\nLogic, nouns are names of objects, that is, substances and\nattributes. Substantive nouns such as \u201cearth\u201d and\n\u201csun\u201d signify substances, and adjectival nouns such as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d signify attributes,\n\u201cindicating at the same time the subject to which they\napply\u2026\u201d. Just as substances are ontologically prior to\ntheir manners or modes, nouns are prior to adjectives in the structure\nof language. From the adjective one then creates a secondary\nsubstantive, an abstract noun:\n\n\nafter having formed the adjective human from the substantive\nword man, we form the substantive humanity from the\nadjective human. (II.1, 74)\n\n\nThus there are three kinds of nouns: concrete substantives,\nadjectives, and abstract substantives. The Logic says that\nadjectives have two significations: a distinct signification of the\nmode or manner, and a confused signification of the subject. Although\nthe signification of the mode is more distinct, it is indirect; by\ncontrast the confused signification of the subject is direct (II.1,\n74\u201375). This is because the idea of a mode is distinctly\nperceived only when its substance is perceived along with it. So every\nnoun picks out or distinctly signifies one thing, either an\nindividual, a collection of individuals, or an attribute. Concrete\nsubstantives distinctly signify complete objects, that is, individual\nsubstances: \u201cman\u201d distinctly signifies human beings. The\nadjective \u201chuman\u201d distinctly signifies the attribute of\nbeing human. And abstract substantives such as \u201chumanity\u201d\nalso pick out this attribute distinctly. But the adjective\n\u201chuman\u201d, unlike the concrete substantive\n\u201cman\u201d, is linguistically incomplete, since it means\n\u201ca human [being]\u201d. Linguistically, adjectives are gappy\nand require completion by a substantive to signify. The Logic\nidentifies this incomplete signification as the connotation\nor confused (but direct) signification of an adjective. So adjectives\nsignify ideas of substances directly and confusedly, and\nideas of attributes indirectly and distinctly. Because\nsubstantive nouns of both kinds are linguistically complete, they lack\nconnotation and have only distinct and direct signification to the\nindividual substances or attributes they name.\n\nThe production of general ideas from less general ones is, as we have\nseen, effected by the mind separating or deleting some components of\nthe less general idea. The general idea of triangle could be produced\nby deleting equilaterality from the idea of an equilateral triangle.\nSimilarly, ideas of greater complexity can be formed by combining less\ncomplex ideas. If, for example, one imagines a pink elephant, that\nidea is formed by combining an idea of an elephant with an idea of\npink. The mental act of affirming or denying one idea of another is\ncalled judging. Mental operations of special importance to logic are\nthose that result in propositions. This is the focus of the next part\nof the Logic.\n",
