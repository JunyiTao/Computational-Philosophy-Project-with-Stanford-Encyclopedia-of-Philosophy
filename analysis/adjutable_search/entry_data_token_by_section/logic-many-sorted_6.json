    "main_text": "Calculus || Completeness Notions\n2.2 Completeness Notions\n\nProof and truth are defined by independent methods and it is not\ntrivial, but necessary, to prove that they are extensionally the same.\nThis is the content of the completeness theorem when this\nproperty is predicated of a sound calculus. There is another\nmeaning of completeness, when it is predicate of a theory: A\ntheory \\(\\Gamma\\) is complete when for each sentence, either\n\\(\\varphi\\) or \\(\\lnot \\varphi\\) is a consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\)\n(Manzano 1989 [1999: 118]). Strong completeness of a calculus\nestablishes its sufficiency for capturing the logical consequence;\nnamely, whenever a sentence follows logically from a set of\nhypotheses, there is a proof of this sentence in the calculus,\npossibly using some of these hypotheses. In contrast, weak\ncompleteness says that we have proofs for all validities. In a\n complete[8]\n logic, the expressive power of the language and its computational\nstrength are well balanced. Thus the question about completeness is\nthe question about the equilibrium of the basic components of a logic:\nits semantics and its logical calculus.\n\nSometimes, we merely say that a logic is complete and qualify\nthis property as abstract completeness. In this case, we are\nonly concerned with the computational characteristics of the set of\nlogical truths (validities), all we need to know is that they are\nrecursively enumerable.\n\nSection 3\n presents many-sorted logic as a unifier logic and we describe the\nthree levels process of embedding into MSL as a path to completeness\nof the logic being studied: abstract completeness at the first level,\nstrong completeness at the third.\n",
