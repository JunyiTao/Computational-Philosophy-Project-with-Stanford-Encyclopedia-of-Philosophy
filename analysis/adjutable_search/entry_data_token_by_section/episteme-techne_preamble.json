    "main_text": "\n\nEpist\u00eam\u00ea is the Greek word most often translated\nas knowledge, while techn\u00ea is translated as either\ncraft or art. These translations, however, may inappropriately harbor\nsome of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory\n(the domain of \u2018knowledge\u2019) and practice (the concern of\n\u2018craft\u2019 or \u2018art\u2019). In our era, the paradigm of\ntheory is pure mathematics, that has no obvious application to\npractical problems of, e.g., engineering. As well, theoretical physics\nsometimes has a tenuous relation to confirming/disconfirming\nexperimentation. At the other end of the spectrum is craft, for\nexample, carpentry, which is so enmeshed in material application that\nit resists any general explanation but must be learned by practice. As\na consequence, theory and practice even seem irreconcilable. Outside\nof modern science, there is sometimes skepticism about the relevance\nof theory to practice because it is thought that theory is conducted\nat so great a remove from the facts, the province of practice, that it\ncan lose touch with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concrete\nexperience might be all we need. Finally, if the practical is widened\nto include more than the way we manipulate the physical world but also\nthe way we lead our lives, the relation between theory and practice\nhas another problematic aspect. Within science, theory strives for a\nvalue-free view of reality. As a consequence, scientific theory cannot\ntell us how things should be or how to lead our lives. This contrast\npresents another aspect of the difference between theory and practice;\npure theory is removed from ethical investigation and the practice of\nliving requires it.\n However, in what follows we will see that some of\nthe features of this contemporary distinction between theory and\npractice are not found in the relation between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea. Others are\nfound in a somewhat refracted fashion. As we move chronologically from\nXenophon to Plotinus, we go from an author who does not distinguish\nbetween the two terms, to an author who has little use for\ntechn\u00ea because it is so far from what he considers to\nbe real. It is in Aristotle that we find the basis for something like\nthe modern opposition between epist\u00eam\u00ea as pure\ntheory and techn\u00ea as practice. Yet even Aristotle\nrefers to techn\u00ea or craft as itself also\nepist\u00eam\u00ea or knowledge because it is a practice\ngrounded in an \u2018account\u2019 \u2014 something involving\ntheoretical understanding. Plato \u2014 whose theory of forms seems\nan arch example of pure theoretical knowledge \u2014 nevertheless is\nfascinated by the idea of a kind of techn\u00ea that is\ninformed by knowledge of forms. In the Republic this\nknowledge is the indispensable basis for the philosophers\u2019 craft\nof ruling in the city. Picking up another theme in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, the Stoics develop the idea that virtue is a kind of\ntechn\u00ea or craft of life, one that is based on an\nunderstanding of the universe. The relation, then, between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea in ancient\nphilosophy offers an interesting contrast with our own notions about\ntheory (pure knowledge) and (experience-based) practice. There is an\nintimate positive relationship between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea, as well as a fundamental contrast.\n",
