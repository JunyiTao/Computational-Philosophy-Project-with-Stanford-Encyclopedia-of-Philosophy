    "main_text": "Four Arguments for the Faithfulness of Pure Wave Mechanics || Pure wave mechanics predicts that one would not ordinarily notice that there are alternative relative records\n5.2 Pure wave mechanics predicts that one would not ordinarily notice that there are alternative relative records\n\nEverett believed that he could also explain why the surplus empirical\nstructure of pure wave mechanics would go unnoticed. In his reply to\nDeWitt, he claimed that pure wave mechanics \u201cis in full accord\nwith our experience (at least insofar as ordinary quantum mechanics\nis) \u2026 just because it is possible to show that no\nobserver would ever be aware of any \u2018branching,\u2019 which is\nalien to our experience as you point out\u201d Barrett and Byrne\n(2012, 254).\n\nThere are two arguments that Everett may have had in mind.\n\nThe first is not one that Everett highlighted, but he clearly\nrecognized the point. One would only notice macroscopic splitting if\none had access to records of macroscopic splitting events.\nSpecifically, one would need to show that there are branches where\none\u2019s macroscopic measurement devices have different macroscopic\nmeasurement records for the same measurement. This would require one\nto perform something akin to a Wigner\u2019s Friend interference\nmeasurement on a macroscopic system in an entangled superposition of\nrecord states that shows that it is. But as Everett indicated in his\ncharacterization of his Wigner Friend drama as \u201cextremely\nhypothetical,\u201d such an experiment would be extraordinarily\ndifficult. The upshot is that, while not impossible, one should not\nexpect to find reliable interference records indicating that there are\nbranches corresponding to alternative macroscopic measurement\nrecords.\n\nThe second is a point to which Everett repeatedly returned in his\ndeductions of the subjective experience of modeled observers in both\nthe long and short thesis. Namely, it follows directly from the linear\ndynamics that it would appear to an ideal agent that she had\nfully determinate measurement results. Albert and Loewer (1988)\npresented a dispositional version of this line of argument in their\npresentation of the bare theory, a version of pure wave mechanics, as\na way of understanding Everett\u2019s formulation of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nThe idea is that if there is no collapse of the quantum-mechanical\nstate, an ideal modeled observer like \\(J\\) would have the sure-fire\ndisposition falsely to report and hence to believe that she\nhad a perfectly ordinary, fully sharp and determinate measurement\nrecord. The trick is to consider not what result the observer got, but\nrather whether she believes that she got some specific\ndeterminate result. If the post-measurement state was:\n\n\\[\n|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S\n\\]\n\n\nthen \\(J\\) would report \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin\nup or spin down\u201d and presumably so believe. And she would make\nprecisely the same report and believe that she got a determinate\nresult if she ended up in the post-measurement state: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nSo, by the linearity of the dynamics, \\(J\\) would falsely\nreport \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin up or spin\ndown\u201d and believe that she got a determinate result when in\npost-measurement state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\): \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\n\\]\n\n\nThus, insofar as her beliefs agree with her sure-fire dispositions to\nreport that she got a fully determinate result, it would seem to \\(J\\)\nthat she got a perfectly determinate ordinary measurement result even\nwhen she did not. That is, she does not determinately believe that she\ngot \u201cspin up\u201d, and she does not determinately believe that\nshe got \u201cspin down\u201d, but she does determinately believe\nthat she got \u201ceither spin up or spin down.\u201d\n\nSo, while which result \\(J\\) got in state \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\)\nis a relative fact, that it would appear to \\(J\\) that she got\nsome determinate result is an absolute fact. See Everett\n(1956, 129\u201330), (1955, 67), (1956, 121\u20133 and 130\u20133),\nand (1957, 186\u20138 and 194\u20135), Albert and Loewer (1988),\nAlbert (1992), and Barrett (1999) and (2020) for further details. We\nwill return to a discussion of the bare theory later in this article\nand consider that theory on its own terms. For present purposes, the\ndeterminate result property illustrates why an observer would not\nreport or notice that she had branched.\n",
