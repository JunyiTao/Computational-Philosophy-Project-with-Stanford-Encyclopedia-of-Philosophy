    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Mozi\n5.2 The Mozi\n\nMozi\u2019s (480\u2013390 BCE) vision for the peaceful and\nprosperous world lies in his philosophy of jian ai (\u517c\u611b),\nimpartial caring or impartial concern for all. He believes that all\nthe major problems of the world such as war, violence, and poverty are\ncaused by the unregulated psychological tendency of partiality and the\nrelentless pursuit of self-interest. According to him, subjective\nfeelings or emotions for others, although they can promote love for\nothers and care for their wellbeing, can become partial and biased\nbecause emotions are typically aroused, expressed, and shared in small\ncommunities of personal relations and social networks. He believes\nthat spontaneously aroused emotions, because of their tendencies of\npartiality, inconsistency, and bias, do not help people to deal with\ntheir hardships and fix the calamities of the world. He states\nthat\n\n\nIt is things such as great states attacking small states, great\nfamilies wreaking havoc with lesser families, the strong robbing the\nweak, the many doing violence to the few, the clever deceiving the\nignorant, and the noble acting arrogantly toward the humble. These are\nsome of the great harms being done in the world. In addition, there\nare rulers who are not kind, ministers who are not loyal, fathers who\nare not loving, and children who are not filial. These too are some of\nthe great harms being done in the world\u2026. If we try to discover\nthe origin of these different harms, where do we find they come\nfrom?\u2026it is those who are partial in their dealings with others\nwho are the real cause of all the great harms in the world.\n(Mozi, 16.1; Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2001: 68)\n\n\nMozi proposes, therefore, jian ai, impartial caring i.e., a\nsense of broad, fair, and consistent moral interest for others\u2019\nwellbeing beyond one\u2019s narrow confinement of personal relations\nand local networks. Generally, ai (\u611b) means love or care.\nIn the context of Mozi\u2019s philosophy, however, it means universal\nlove, i.e., one\u2019s unbiased and impartial interest for\nothers\u2019 wellbeing. It is love, concern, or care without\naffective partiality such as one\u2019s strong feeling for\none\u2019s parents but lack of concern for strangers. For this\nreason, ai does not seem to be a typical emotion of care and\nconcern. Graham (1989: 31\u201332) states that it is\n\u201cunemotional will to benefit and avoid harming people\u201d.\nHowever, ai does not necessarily exclude the affective\nelements of caring or concern. As Shun explains (1997: 31), it can\ninclude \u201creacting affectively in response to negative conditions\nof the objects of concern\u201d. Vir\u00e1g (2017: 59) also points\nout that \n\n\nJian ai possesses a spectrum of meanings in the text [the\nMozi], from strong affection to a more detached concern for\nthe well-being of others. \n\n\nThe unique aspect of Mozi\u2019s jian ai is that it seems to\nbe an affective duty constructed out of his argument to overcome\npartiality and bias. If jian ai is an emotion, it is not a\nspontaneous feeling but a cultivated emotion, i.e., one\u2019s\ncarefully developed, unbiased, impartial, and affective interest for\nthe benefit of others and the world.\n\nMozi presents his famous argument for impartial love in the following\npassage.\n\n\nIf people were to regard others\u2019 states as they regard their own\nstate, then who would still mobilise their own state to attack the\nstates of others? They would regard others\u2019 [states] as they\nregard their own. If people were to regard the capital cities of\nothers as they regard their own capital city, then who would still\nraise their own capital city to strike at the capital cities of\nothers? They would regard others\u2019 [capital cities] as they\nregard their own. If people were to regard the houses of others as\nthey regard their own house, who would still stir their own house to\nbring disorder to the houses of others? They would regard\nothers\u2019 [houses] as they regard their own. Now if states and\ncities did not attack and strike at each other, and if people\u2019s\nhouses did not bring disorder to and damage each other, would this be\nharmful to the world? Or would it be beneficial to the world? This\nmust be beneficial to the world. For the moment let us think about the\norigin of these many benefits, what it is they arise from\u2026.We\nmust say that it is from loving people and benefiting people that they\narise. And, if we were to distinguish and name those in the world who\nlove people and benefit people, would it be as\n\u201cdiscriminating\u201d or as \u201cuniversal\u201d? We must\nsay it would be as \u201cuniversal\u201d. In this case, then, it is\n\u201cmutual and universal\u201d which gives rise to the\nworld\u2019s great benefits. (Mozi, 16.2; Johnston 2010:\n147\u2013149)\n\n\nMozi\u2019s argument, in this passage, does not seem to prove the\nexistence of an emotion of universal love and mutual caring. Instead,\nthe argument attempts to prove the importance of impartiality and the\nnecessity of an emotional dedication for the universal love. It is a\nrational justification that calls for a reciprocal and universal\nviewpoint where one should take equal interest for oneself and others.\nIn this context, one can suspect the psychological reality and\npractical effectiveness of Mozi\u2019s universal love. The main\ntheoretical challenge is to explain the motivation of impartial caring\non the basis of a reasoning that impartial caring is morally justified\nand a rationally right thing to do (Graham 1989: 31\u201332; Nivison\n1996: 84; Vir\u00e1g 2017: 61\u201362). Can the affective\nmotivation of jian ai come out of a rational argument or\ndoxastic moral justification? Although one does not need to\ndistinguish rationality and emotionality of jian ai and can\naccept the diverse forms of moral motivation (Fraser 2011; Robins\n2012), Mozi\u2019s approach to emotion is clearly different from that\nof Confucians, such as Confucius and Mencius. The Confucians believe\nthat natural or genuine emotional states can align themselves with\nmoral will and ideal virtues through the process of self-cultivation,\nlearning or other mental practices. Mozi seems to focus primarily on\nreasoning and rational justification for jian ai, although he\ndoes not completely reject or devalue the affective elements of\njian ai and the various means of its cultivation. According\nto him, jian ai makes rulers kind, ministers loyal, and\nfathers compassionate, and the gentleman carefully examining it and\ndiligently practicing it (Mozi, 16.2; Johnston 2010:\n165).\n\nQing appears 26 times in the Mozi but it does not\nrefer to inner affective states of the mind. Instead, it is used in at\nleast three different ways. Mozi states that\n\n\nEvery creature living between Heaven and earth and within the four\nseas partakes of the nature [qing \u60c5] of Heaven and\nearth and the harmony of the Yin and the Yang. Even the greatest sages\ncannot alter this. How do we know? When they taught about Heaven and\nearth, they dwelt on the upper and the lower spheres and the four\nseasons, the principles of Yin and Yang and human nature [ren\nqing \u4eba\u60c5], the phenomena of men and women, birds and\nanimals, and that of the sexes. Even the early kings could not escape\nfrom the fundamentals of nature. (Mozi, 6.8; Mei 1929:\n26).\n\n\nIn this passage, Mozi describes qing (\u60c5) as the firm\nand objective nature of the world (\u5929\u58e4\u4e4b\u60c5)\nincluding human nature (ren qing \u4eba\u60c5), that is\nunalterable and unmodifiable even by the sage kings. The whole passage\nexplains the natural order of the universe (time, space, living and\nnon-living things) and the natures of human beings and\nanimals. Here, qing has no relation to emotions or\nfeelings.\n\nIn another passage, Mozi uses qing to explain the\nsociopolitical environment of a state. He states that those rulers who\nunderstand the qing of common people will be successful\nleaders but those who do not understand the qing will bring\nchaos (Mozi, 13.1; Mei 1929: 70). Here qing means a\nbroad sociopolitical environment, specifically the living (economic,\ncultural, social and political) conditions of people. Mozi states that\nunderstanding people\u2019s qing is a critical element of\nsuccessful leadership. Rulers should carefully observe the\nsocio-political reality of their states and the living conditions and\nopinions of their people. This type of qing falls in the\nsemantic category of situations, circumstances, or reality. Cai (2020:\n403) interprets it as existential conditions of people and\nVir\u00e1g (2017: 56) takes it as sentiment or affective\ndispositions of people.\n\nQing also means truth or truthful in the Mozi\n(36.1). When Mozi explains the (epistemological) standard of\njudgments, he states that \n\n\nNow that the truth and error [qing wei \u60c5\u507d] (of a\ndoctrine) in the world is hard to tell, there must be three tests.\n(Mozi, 36.1; Mei 1929: 189) \n\n\nMei (1929) translates qing wei as truth and error but it can\nbe understood as genuine (truthful) and artifice (deceiving), i.e., a\ncontrastive pair of epistemological properties. Qing is also\nused adverbially. It means sincerely, earnestly, seriously, or really.\nMozi states that if \n\n\nthe rulers now really [qing \u60c5] desire gain and avert loss,\ndesire security and avert danger, they cannot but condemn offensive\nwars (Mozi, 18.4; Mei 1929: 104) \n\n\nAlthough, the adverbial meaning is related to qing\u2019s\nnounal meaning, i.e., genuineness, it reveals a unique way emotions\nrelate to their objects. Emotions, like beliefs and perceptions, have\ntheir own intentionality, i.e., their own way of referring to their\ntarget objects. For example, people are not just angry. They are angry\nabout certain things or events (someone stole their cars, for example)\nin certain ways (highly stressful and frustrating ways). Regarding\nthis unique form of affective intentionality, Bockover (1995: 174) states that \n\n\nthe difference between beliefs and emotions\u2026is that emotions\nentail distinctively affective ways of being conscious about things.\n\n\n\nIn its adverbial use in the Mozi, qing shows this\nunique aspect of affective intentionality. Emotions do not simply\nrelate to their targets: they can relate to their targets with diverse\nadverbial modes (i.e., strongly, weakly, sincerely, or superficially\netc.).\n",
