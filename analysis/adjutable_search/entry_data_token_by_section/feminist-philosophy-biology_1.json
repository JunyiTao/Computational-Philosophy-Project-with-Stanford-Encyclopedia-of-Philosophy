    "main_text": "Motivations, Epistemic Perspectives and Methods || Motivations\n2.1 Motivations\n\n\nWork in feminist philosophy of biology can be motivated by a number\nof, often interrelated, goals including countering biological arguments\nsupporting women's oppression, revealing and analyzing the role\nof gender values in the production of biological knowledge, and\nfacilitating the production of maximally accurate accounts of female\nbiology and gendered topics of study in the biological\nsciences.\n\n\nThe science of biology is of importance to many feminists because\nwomen's biology has been used to rationalize women's oppression. There\nis a wide range of biological arguments supporting the oppression of\nwomen. Take for example Edward H.  Clarke's nineteenth century\nargument that intensive study would physically harm women by diverting\nenergy from their uterus to their brain. He claimed that higher\neducation would result in women with \u201cmonstrous brains and puny\nbodies \u2026 [and] abnormally weak digestion\u201d (Clarke 1874,\n41). This argument regarding women's inferiority has been a focus of\nfeminist philosophy of biology (see for example Hubbard\n1990). Similarly, evolutionary arguments that can provide foundational\nsupport for sexist or oppressive practices, for example, arguments for\nthe adaptive nature of violence against women (see Palmer and\nThornhill (2000) for a readable account of this research program),\nhave drawn intensive feminist scrutiny (for example see papers in\nTravis 2003a). Harvard past-president Lawrence Summers was not the\nfirst or only person to use biological arguments about the different\ndistributions of intelligence among men and women to justify the\nabsence of women from positions of social power and from higher\npowered careers (Wilson 1978, Summers 2005\u2014see the Other\nInternet Resources). Here also, there is a significant feminist\nresponse (Bleier 1984, Fausto-Sterling 1992, Fehr 2008).\n\n\nFeminists have pointed out that much of the political power of these\nsorts of biological arguments arises from problematic assumptions of\ndeterminism (see section 4.1), or in other words, assumptions of a\nclose connection between women's biology, in terms of genes,\nhormones, and physiology, and women's psychological attributes\nand social positions. The general notion is that\nbiology, as opposed to culture, is static and fixed. As a result\nsome contend that any political activity designed to change or improve\nwomen's condition is trying to create an \u2018unnatural\u2019\nsystem that is doomed to fail. This position, while common\nin nineteenth and early twentieth century biology, can still be found\nin the work of some contemporary biologists, including some early and\ninfluential work in sociobiology (Wilson 1978). As a result\nfeminists have been strongly motivated to analyze particular claims\nabout female biology, to interrogate the assumption that genetic or\nbiological nature implies fixity, and to reveal the wide range of\ninteracting biological and social causes of women's phenotypes,\nincluding their psychological attributes and social positions. In\nsection four I will discuss biological determinism in more detail.\n\n\nFeminist philosophy of biology is also driven by epistemic\nmotivations. For example, feminists such as Ruth Bleier (1984)\nand Anne Fausto-Sterling (1985/1992) reveal that sexist and\nandrocentric biases can be found in the biological knowledge produced\naccording to biological science's contemporary best practices or\naccepted epistemic standards. This can drive more general\nquestions about the role that values in general, and gender values in\nparticular, play in the production of scientific or biological\nknowledge (Longino 1990, 2002; Richardson 2008).\n\n\nFinally, much feminist philosophy of biology is also very concerned\nwith getting the biology right. Many feminist philosophers of\nbiology were initially trained as scientists and are interested not\njust in critiquing, but also in improving the practice of science as it\nrelates to sex and gender. Along similar lines, feminist\nphilosophers have also documented the impact of feminism on improving\nthe practices of the biological sciences themselves. For example,\nDonna Haraway's book Primate Visions (1989) documents\nthe influence that the incorporation of feminist women in primatology\nhad on the study of primate behavior and animal behavior more\ngenerally. Haraway shows that feminist primatologist Jeanne\nAltmann, instigated a quiet but powerful methodological revolution. In\none of the most cited papers in the study of animal behavior,\n\u201cObservational study of behavior: Sampling methods\u201d (1974),\nAltmann evaluated a range of sampling methods and in doing so developed\na method, focal-animal sampling, that undermined previous research\ngenerating sexist accounts of leadership and control, and enabled\nresearch on female primates and on novel topics such as mothering.\nAltmann, troubled by the androcentric focus in primatology and\nless than rigorous methodologies, brought her perspectives as a woman,\na feminist, a mother, and a mathematically trained scientist to bear on\nimproving research methods. Focal animal sampling provides an\neffective method for studying the social behavior of female primates\nand has become an important approach in animal behavior research in\ngeneral. Haraway's description of Altmann's\ncontributions to primatology and animal behavior provides an example of\nthe positive impact of feminism and feminist scientists on the\npractices and products of scientific research.\n\n\nMotivations to conduct research in feminist philosophy of biology\ninclude the drive to challenge biological justifications for\nwomen's oppression, interrogate the epistemic function of gender\nvalues in scientific practice, and improve the practices and products\nof biological research on sex and gender.\n",
