    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Passionate Love\n6.4 Passionate Love\n\n\nIt might be additionally noted that Maimonides reflects mystical\nIslamic Sufi language once again when, in his description of the\nculminating moment of intellectual perfection, he employs the Arabic\nlanguage of \u201c\u2018ishq\u201d (passionate love, love,\ndesire).[20]\nThis terminology is also expressly used by Maimonides\u2019 Islamic\nphilosophical predecessor Avicenna in his own \u201cRis\u0101lah\nf\u012b\u2019l-\u2018ishq\u201d (\u201cTreatise on\nLove\u201d) where he explores God\u2019s reality as the pure object of\nlove (a point seen already in Aristotle\u2019s idea of God as the final\nobject of all desire), as well as the pure subject of\nlove.[21]\n\nReflecting on the related Hebrew term\n\u1e25\u014dsh\u0113q (one who loves passionately) as it relates\nto his reading of Psalms 91:14, Maimonides explains,\n\n\n\u2026you know the difference between the terms one who\nloves (here Maimonides uses the Hebrew word\n\u201c\u014dh\u0113v\u201d) and one who loves\npassionately (here Maimonides uses the Hebrew word\n\u201c\u1e25\u014dsh\u0113q\u201d); an excess of love, so\nthat no thought remains that is directed toward a thing other than the\nBeloved, is passionate love (\u2018ishq) (G 3.51, P 627).\n\n\n\n\nIt is certainly not evident that Maimonides literally has a mystical\nunion in mind in this passage, even with his use of what might seem to\nbe charged mystical language. The possibility of a mystical meaning\nfor this and surrounding passages at Guide 3.51 remains subject to\ndebate, although the most straightforward account of what Maimonides\nis up to here remains entirely non-mystical: purely in line with an\nIslamic Neoplatonized Aristotelian epistemological tradition of\noverflow/conjunction, Maimonides understands \u201cpassionate\nlove\u201d of God (and related Biblical claims about God's kissing\nthe prophet Moses) as that moment in which the human intellect comes\ninto full alignment with the active intellect, thus reaching the\nheight of human perfection.\n",
