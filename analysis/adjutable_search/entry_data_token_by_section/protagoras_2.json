The \u201cMan Measure\u201d Thesis\n\nIn Plato\u2019s Protagoras Protagoras claims that he teaches\neuboulia, good deliberation: \n\n\nThe object of my instruction is good deliberation about household\nmatters, to know how to manage one\u2019s own household in the best\nway possible, and about those of the city, so as to be most capable of\nacting and speaking in the city\u2019s interest. (318e\u2013319a = 80A5\nDK) \n\n\nProtagoras\u2019 teaching had a practical and concrete goal, and many\nof the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it was mainly\ndevoted to the development of argumentative techniques (which were\nprobably investigated in texts such as the already mentioned\nAntilogiai and The Art of Eristics). Unfortunately,\nwe have little evidence of what these actually were. In all\nprobability, assertions such as that on every matter there are two\nlogoi opposed to one another (80A1, B6a DK) or that it is\nimpossible to contradict (80A19 DK), along with the claim to make the\nweaker logos (the) stronger (80B6b DK), belong to this\ncontext. Part of his teaching was also devoted to grammatical or\nlinguistic issues and poetry analysis. More in general, it is also\nunclear the relation between his teachings and the apparent relativism\nof his famous thesis that the man is the measure of all things.\nAncient sources report that this sentence opened Truth, a\npublic declamation (epideixis) with which he presented\nhimself to the public to potential pupils.\n",
