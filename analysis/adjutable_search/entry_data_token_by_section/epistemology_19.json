Among them, we\nmust list psychological factors such as desires, emotional needs,\nprejudice, and biases of various kinds. Obviously, when beliefs\noriginate in sources like these, they don\u2019t qualify as knowledge\neven if true. For true beliefs to count as knowledge, it is necessary\nthat they originate in sources we have good reason to consider\nreliable. These are perception, introspection, memory, reason, and\ntestimony. Let us briefly consider each of these.\n",
