    "main_text": "Traditional Questions || Incommensurability/Incomparability\n2.3 Incommensurability/Incomparability\n\nWe have just seen that one of the issues at stake in the debate\nbetween monists and pluralists about value turns on the question\n(vaguely put) of whether values can be incomparable or\nincommensurable. This is consequently an area of active dispute in its\nown right. There are, in fact, many distinct issues in this debate,\nand sometimes several of them are run together.\n2.3.1 Is there Weak Incomparability?\n\nOne of the most important questions at stake is whether it must always\nbe true, for two states of affairs, that things would be better if the\nfirst obtained than if the second did, that things would be better if\nthe second obtained than if the first did, or that things would be\nequally good if either obtained. The claim that it can sometimes\nhappen that none of these is true is sometimes referred to as the\nclaim of incomparability, in this case as applied to good\nsimpliciter. Ruth Chang [2002] has argued that in addition to\n\u201cbetter than\u201d, \u201cworse than\u201d, and\n\u201cequally good\u201d, there is a fourth \u201cpositive value\nrelation\u201d, which she calls parity. Chang reserves the use\nof \u201cincomparable\u201d to apply more narrowly, to the\npossibility that in addition to none of the other three relations\nholding between them, it is possible that two states of affairs may\nfail even to be \u201con a par\u201d. However, we can distinguish\nbetween weak incomparability, defined as above, and\nstrong incomparability, further requiring the lack of parity,\nwhatever that turns out to be. Since the notion of parity is\nitself a theoretical idea about how to account for what happens when\nthe other three relations fail to obtain, a question which I\nwon\u2019t pursue here, it will be weak incomparability that will\ninterest us here.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the question of whether good\nsimpliciter admits of incomparability from the question of\nwhether good for and attributive good admit of incomparability.\nMany discussions of the incomparability of values proceed at a very\nabstract level, and interchange examples of each of these kinds of\nvalue claims. For example, a typical example of a purported\nincomparability might compare, say, Mozart to Rodin. Is Mozart a\nbetter artist than Rodin? Is Rodin a better artist than Mozart? Are\nthey equally good? If none of these is the case, then we have an\nexample of incomparability in attributive good, but not an example of\nincomparability in good simpliciter. These questions may be\nparallel or closely related, and investigation of each may be\ninstructive in consideration of the other, but they still need to be\nkept separate.\n\nFor example, one important argument against the incomparability of\nvalue was mentioned in the previous section. It is that\nincomparability would rule out the possibility of practical wisdom,\nbecause practical wisdom requires the ability to make correct choices\neven in complicated choice situations. Choices are presumably between\nactions, or between possible consequences of those actions. So it\ncould be that attributive good is sometimes incomparable, because\nneither Mozart nor Rodin is a better artist than the other and they\nare not equally good, but that good simpliciter is always\ncomparable, so that there is always an answer as to which of two\nactions would lead to an outcome that is better.\n2.3.2 What Happens when there is Weak Incomparability?\n\nEven once it is agreed that good simpliciter is incomparable in\nthis sense, many theories have been offered as to what that\nincomparability involves and why it exists. One important constraint\non such theories is that they not predict more incomparabilities than\nwe really observe. For example, though Rodin may not be a better or\nworse artist than Mozart, nor equally good, he is certainly a better\nartist than Salieri \u2014 even though Salieri, like Mozart, is a\nbetter composer than Rodin. This is a problem for the idea that\nincomparability can be explained by value pluralism. The argument from\nvalue pluralism to incomparability suggested that it would be\nimpossible to compare any two states of affairs where one contained\nmore of one basic value and the other contained more of another. But\ncases like that of Rodin and Salieri show that the explanation of what\nis incomparable between Rodin and Mozart can\u2019t simply be that\nsince Rodin is a better sculptor and Mozart is a better composer,\nthere is no way of settling who is the better artist. If that were the\ncorrect explanation, then Rodin and Salieri would also be\nincomparable, but intuitively, they are not. Constraints like these\ncan narrow down the viable theories about what is going on in cases of\nincomparability, and are evidence that incomparability is probably not\ngoing to be straightforwardly explained by value pluralism.\n\nThere are many other kinds of theses that go under the title of the\nincomparability or incommensurability of values. For example, some\ntheories which posit lexical orderings are said to commit to\n\u201cincomparabilities\u201d. Kant\u2019s thesis that rational\nagents have a dignity and not a price is often taken to be a thesis\nabout a kind of incommensurability, as well. Some have interpreted\nKant to be holding simply that respect for rational agents is of\ninfinite value, or that it is to be lexically ordered over the value\nof anything else. Another thesis in the neighborhood, however, would\nbe somewhat weaker. It might be that a human life is \u201cabove\nprice\u201d in the sense that killing one to save one is not an\nacceptable exchange, but that for some positive value of \\(n\\),\nkilling one to save \\(n\\) would be an acceptable exchange. On this\nview, there is no single \u201cexchange value\u201d for a life,\nbecause the value of a human life depends on whether you are\n\u201cbuying\u201d or \u201cselling\u201d \u2014 it is higher\nwhen you are going to take it away, but lower when you are going to\npreserve it. Such a view would intelligibly count as a kind of\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d, because it sets no single value on\nhuman lives.\n\nA more detailed discussion of the commensurability of values can be\nfound in the entry on\n incommensurable values.\n",
