    "main_text": "History of Logic || Stoic Propositional Logic\n6.1 Stoic Propositional Logic\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s third signal achievement, along with his\ninvestigations of many-valued and propositional logics, is his work in\nthe history of logic. Indeed he can reasonably be considered the\nfather of the modern way of doing the history of logic, which is\npursued, to quote the subtitle of his book on Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic, \u201cfrom the standpoint of modern formal logic.\u201d\nWe saw that his early book on the principle of contradiction in\nAristotle was relatively unsuccessful in its own terms, though it\ndemonstrated his ability to go to the heart of the ancient Greek\ntexts.\n\nA decisive event in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s development as an\nhistorian of logic was his discovery of ancient Stoic logic. It seems\nhe was examining a dissertation on the Stoics and to prepare for it he\nread original texts. He thereupon discovered that Stoic logic,\ncontrary to the then standard opinion, voiced by Prantl, Zeller and\nothers, was not a bowdlerized and defective Aristotelian syllogistic,\nbut an early propositional logic, so that for example the first Stoic\nindemonstrable, \u201cif the first, then the second; but the first,\ntherefore the second\u201d is simply modus ponens or detachment for\nthe conditional \u2018if\u2019, and the variables, represented not\nby letters but by ordinal numerals, are propositional variables, not\nterm variables. He first voiced this view, which is now of course\nstandard, at a meeting in Lw\u00f3w in 1923. A more systematic\ntreatment of 1934, \u201cOn the History of the Logic of\nPropositions\u201d, is a delightful vignette taking in the broad\nsweep from the Stoics, ancient disputes about the meaning of the\nconditional, Petrus Hispanus and Ockham on the De Morgan laws, the\nmedieval theory of consequences, and culminating with Frege and modern\npropositional calculi. Modern appreciation of the achievements of\nStoic logic dates from \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s clarification and his\nunstinting praise of the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.\n\u0141ukasiewicz appreciated that Prantl did not have the benefit of\nknowing post-Fregean logic, and despite Prantl\u2019s erroneous\ndismissal of the \u201cstupidity\u201d of much Stoic logic did at\nleast provide helpful sources. Nevertheless, \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\njudgement on past historians of logic is scathing:\n\nThe history of logic must be written anew, and by an\nhistorian who has a thorough command of modern mathematical logic.\nValuable as Prantl\u2019s work is as a compilation of sources and\nmaterials, from a logical point of view it is practically worthless\n[\u2026] Nowadays it does not suffice to be merely a philosopher in\norder to voice one\u2019s opinion on logic.
