    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics\n3. Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics\n\nWhile metaethics addresses second-order questions about morality,\nnormative ethics addresses first-order ethical questions about what to\ndo and how to be and divides into applied ethics and ethical (or\nmoral) theory. The former, also referred to as \u201cpractical\nethics\u201d, addresses questions about specific ethical issues\n(e.g., abortion, capital punishment) and ethical issues that arise in\nthe professions (e.g., medical ethics, business ethics). Normative\nethical theory (ethical theory henceforth), by contrast, addresses\ngeneral questions about which types of actions are morally\nright or wrong and what kind of person is morally good and\nwhy. In this section, we focus primarily on the bearing of moral\nphenomenology on ethical theory, in particular theories of right\nconduct (obligation), organized around three \u201cformal\u201d\nissues: (1) deontology vs. consequentialism about the structure of\nethical theory, (2) monism vs. pluralism about the number of\nfundamental morally relevant factors that determine, e.g., whether an\naction is right or wrong (an action\u2019s deontic status), and (3)\natomism vs. holism about the significance of morally relevant\ndescriptive features in explaining the instantiation of normative or\nevaluative properties. We take these up in order, after which we\nconclude with some remarks about other normative ethical issues that\nhave received attention from moral phenomenologists.\n",
