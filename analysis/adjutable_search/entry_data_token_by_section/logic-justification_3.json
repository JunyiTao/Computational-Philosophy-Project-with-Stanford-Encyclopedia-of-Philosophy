    "main_text": "Why Justification Logic? || Hyperintensionality\n1.3 Hyperintensionality\nThe hyperintensional paradox was formulated by Cresswell in 1975.\n\nIt is well known that it seems possible to have a situation in\nwhich there are two propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) which are logically\nequivalent and yet are such that a person may believe the one but not\nthe other. If we regard a proposition as a set of possible worlds then\ntwo logically equivalent propositions will be identical, and so if\n\u2018\\(x\\) believes that\u2019 is a genuine sentential functor, the\nsituation described in the opening sentence could not arise. I call\nthis the paradox of hyperintensional contexts. Hyperintensional\ncontexts are simply contexts which do not respect logical\nequivalence.\n\nStarting with Cresswell himself, several ways of dealing with this\nhave been proposed. Generally these involve adding more layers to\nfamiliar possible world approaches so that some way of distinguishing\nbetween logically equivalent sentences is available. Cresswell\nsuggested that the syntactic form of sentences be taken into\naccount. Justification Logic, in effect, takes sentence form into\naccount through its mechanism for handling justifications for\nsentences. Thus Justification Logic addresses some of the central\nissues of hyperintensionality and, as a bonus, we automatically have\nan appropriate proof theory, model theory, complexity estimates and a\nbroad variety of applications.\nA good example of a hyperintensional context is the informal\nlanguage used by mathematicians conversing with each other. Typically\nwhen a mathematician says he or she knows something, the understanding\nis that a proof is at hand. But as the following illustrates, this\nkind of knowledge is essentially hyperintensional.\n\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem, FLT, is logically equivalent to\n\\(0=0\\) since both are provable, and hence denote the same\nproposition. However, the context of proofs distinguishes them\nimmediately: a proof \\(t\\) of \\(0=0\\) is not necessarily a proof of\nFLT, and vice versa.\n\nTo formalize mathematical speech the justification logic\n\\({\\textsf{LP}}\\) is a natural choice since \\(t{:}X\\) was designed to\nhave characteristics of \u201c\\(t\\) is a proof of\n\\(X\\).\u201d\nThe fact that propositions \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are equivalent in\n\\({\\textsf{LP}}\\), \\(X\\leftrightarrow Y\\), does not warrant the\nequivalence of the corresponding justification assertions and\ntypically \\(t{:}X\\) and \\(t{:}Y\\) are not equivalent,\n\\(t{:}X\\not\\leftrightarrow t{:}Y\\).\nGoing further \\({\\textsf{LP}}\\), and Justification Logic in\ngeneral, is not only sufficiently refined to distinguish justification\nassertions for logically equivalent sentences, it provides a flexible\nmachinery to connect justifications of equivalent sentences and hence\nto maintain constructive closure properties necessary for a quality\nlogic system. For example, let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be provably equivalent,\ni.e., there is a proof \\(u\\) of \\(X\\leftrightarrow Y\\), and so\n\\(u{:}(X\\leftrightarrow Y)\\) is provable in \\({\\textsf{LP}}\\). Suppose\nalso that \\(v\\) is a proof of \\(X\\), and so \\(v{:}X\\). It has already\nbeen mentioned that this does not mean \\(v\\) is a proof of\n\\(Y\\)\u2014this is a hyperintensional context. However within the\nframework of Justification Logic, building on the proofs of \\(X\\) and\nof \\(X\\leftrightarrow Y\\), we can construct a proof term\n\\(f(u,v)\\) which represents the proof of \\(Y\\) and so \\(f(u,v){:}Y\\)\nis provable. In this respect, Justification Logic goes beyond\nCresswell\u2019s expectations: logically equivalent sentences display\ndifferent but constructively controlled epistemic behavior.\n",
