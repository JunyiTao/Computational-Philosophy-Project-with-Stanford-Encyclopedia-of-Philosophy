Modality and Clear and Distinct Perception\n\nThere are a number of claims about possibilities and necessities that\nseem to be intuitive \u2013 for example that it is possible that\nthings be other than they are \u2013 but Descartes will not make his\naccount of modality sensitive to all of these. Famously he subscribes\nto the view that when doing metaphysics we ought not affirm what we do\nnot clearly and distinctly perceive. Descartes reveals his commitment\nto this view in a number of passages:\n\nI should like you to remember here that, in matters which may be\nembraced by the will, I made a very careful distinction between the\nconduct of life and the contemplation of the truth. As far as the\nconduct of life is concerned, I am very far from thinking that we\nshould assent only to what is clearly perceived. \u2026But when we\nare dealing solely with the contemplation of the truth, surely no one\nhas ever denied that we should refrain from giving assent to matters\nwhich we do not perceive with sufficient\n distinctness.[1]\n\n\nIf Descartes holds that when doing metaphysics we ought not speak of\nwhat we do not clearly and distinctly perceive, a general Cartesian\ntheory of modality should not be sensitive to claims about\npossibilities or necessities that Descartes himself would identify as\nconfused. There are modal claims that only seem intuitive and obvious,\nDescartes might say, and modal claims that actually are intuitive and\nobvious, and he would want his account of modality to accommodate only\nthe latter.\n\nIndeed, one reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that there are many modal claims that we might want to give a\nrigorous analysis but that Descartes would not. That is to say, the\naccount that he offers will not necessarily square with all of the\nmodal claims that we would advance pre-reflectively. For example, we\nmight observe a blue table in front of us and put forward the claim\nthat it is possible that the table not be blue and that it could have\nbeen black. Descartes himself is going to be careful about accepting\nsuch a claim at face-value. He subscribes to the view that strictly\nspeaking our senses \u201cprovide only very obscure\ninformation\u201d (The Sixth Meditation, AT 7:84, CSM 2:58) about the\nbodies located outside of us. Our \u201cknowledge of the truth of\nsuch things [located outside of us] seems to belong to the mind alone,\nnot to the combination of mind and body\u201d (ibid., AT\n7:82\u201383, CSM 2:57), and what the mind perceives clearly about\nbodies are non-sensory qualities like extendedness and flexibility\n(The Second Meditation, AT 7:30\u201331, CSM 2:20). Or as he says\nelsewhere, the certainty that we seek in metaphysical inquiry\n\u201coccurs in the clear perceptions of the intellect and nowhere\nelse\u201d (Second Replies, AT 7:145, CSM 2:104). He adds:\n\u201ccertainty does not lie in the senses but solely in the\nunderstanding, when it possesses evident perceptions\u201d (Preface\nto the French edition of Principles of Philosophy, AT 8A:7, CSM\n1:182); \u201cIntuition is the indubitable conception of a clear and\nattentive mind which proceeds solely from the light of reason\u201d\n(Rules for the Direction of the Mind, AT 10:368, CSM 1:14). Returning\nnow to the claim that it is possible that a given table not be blue\nand that it could have been black, we need to keep in mind that on\nDescartes\u2019 view colors are not in objects in the way that we\nnormally imagine them to be (Principles of Philosophy I.68,\nAT 8A:33, CSM 1:217). We might also advance the claim that it is\npossible that our blue table could occupy a different position in\nempty space, or the claim that it could begin to move without being\npushed into motion by a cause. The first claim supposes what Descartes\ndenies \u2013 that there is empty space (Principles\nII.10\u201312, AT 8A:45\u201347, CSM 1:226\u201328) \u2013 and the\nsecond contradicts a Cartesian law of motion that falls immediately\nout of our idea of God (Principles II.36\u201337, AT\n8A:61\u201363, CSM 1:240\u201341; Nadler 1987). No matter how the\ndebate is resolved on these important systematic issues, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that Descartes\u2019 theory of modality\nwill be somewhat\n circumscribed.[2]\n His theory of modality will do justice to truths about possibility\nand truths about necessity, but much of what he takes to be possible\nor necessary is not what we would take to be possible or necessary at\nfirst glance. If we suppose that we are being charitable by allowing\nhis theory of modality to accommodate a modal claim that we are\ncertain is true, we might be foisting upon him an interpretation that\nhe would prefer to resist. No doubt he might be mistaken in what he\ntakes to be the set of true modal claims, but his account would end up\nbeing mindful of those and not any others.\n\nA related reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that in what is perhaps his most important and influential\nphilosophical work \u2013 Meditations on First Philosophy\n\u2013 Descartes often advances a claim that in the final analysis he\nrejects. He advances modal claims that he takes to be false, and many\nother claims that he advances he takes to be false as well. For\nexample, he says that what we know best we know either from or through\nthe senses (First Meditation, AT 7:18, CSM 2:17); that it is possible\nthat God is an extreme deceiver (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that\nGod does not exist (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that God, the\nsupreme being on whom all entities depend for their existence, has\nallowed the existence of an evil demon that is constantly deceiving us\n(CSM 2:20); that we should use imagination to get to know our selves\nbetter (Second Meditation, AT 7:27, CSM 2:18); that general\nperceptions are apt to be more confused than particular ones\n(ibid., AT 7:30, CSM 2:20); that bodies literally possess\nqualities like color and taste and sound (ibid.) and heat\n(The Third Meditation, AT 7:41, 43\u201344, CSM 2:28, 30\u201331);\nand that the appropriate way to inquire into whether or not the works\nof God are perfect is to examine the universe in its entirety (The\nFourth Meditation, AT 7:55\u201356, CSM 2:38\u201339). Descartes\ndoes not subscribe to a single one of these views. He thinks that upon\nfurther reflection we recognize that God is a necessary existent and\nthat it is impossible for Him to be a radical deceiver or to allow the\nexistence of a radical deceiver; that what is known best is known by\npurely mental scrutiny (Second Meditation, AT 7:31, CSM 2:21); that\ngeneral perceptions are more clear than perceptions of particulars\n(ibid.); that color and taste and sound and heat are not in\nbodies in anything like the way that we imagine (Sixth Meditation, AT\n7:81\u201383, CSM 2:56\u201358; Principles IV.198, AT\n8A:322\u201323, CSM 1:285); and that things are good by virtue of the\nfact that God wills them (Sixth Replies, AT 7:431\u201336,\nCSM 2:291\u201394).\n\nDescartes advances a number of claims that are false in the\nMeditations, but he does this for good reason. He is writing\nin the voice of a meditator who at the start of inquiry is not yet a\nCartesian and who in the course of inquiry is expressing views that\nseem to him to be true from his first-person and non-Cartesian\npoint-of-view. The meditator will express and evaluate these views and\nsee for himself how they collapse on their own weight.\n\nIt might seem surprising that as a philosopher Descartes ever flirts\nwith confusions at all. When he does so he is just employing his\nanalytic method \u2013 what he calls the \u201cbest and\ntruest method of instruction\u2026\u201d (Second Replies,\nAT 7:156, CSM 2:111). Descartes does not hide that he sometimes makes\nclaims early in the Meditations that from a later and more\nsophisticated point of view he will retract. He says,\n\nThe analytic style of writing that I adopted there [in the\nMeditations] allows us from time to time to make certain\nassumptions that have not yet been thoroughly examined; and this comes\nout in the First Meditation where I made many assumptions which I\nproceeded to refute in subsequent\n Meditations.[3]\n\n\nDescartes advances such claims because he is trying to teach his\nmetaphysics and because he thinks that his readers will not be in a\nposition to grasp that metaphysics if he only makes claims that are\n true.[4]\n Reflecting the epistemic individualism that is common in 17th-Century\nPhilosophy, Descartes insists that we should not accept a view until\nwe see its truth for ourselves (Appendix to Fifth Replies, AT\n9A:208, CSM 2:272\u201373). But he also holds that at the start of\ninquiry our conceptions and commitments are way off. Most of us are\ninclined to affirm that what we know best we know through the senses,\nalong with the other falsities already mentioned, but in addition: our\nconceptions of mind and God represent mind and God as sensible when\nthey are not; we think and speak by way of terms that we do not\nunderstand or that may have no corresponding idea; and what we take to\nbe the paradigm of a distinct perception is hardly distinct at\n all.[5]\n We take in information against the background of our current\ncommitments and conceptions, and so are primed to reject what\nconflicts with\n them.[6]\n When we work through the Meditations from the first-person\npoint-of-view, we accept or reject things when we see for ourselves\nthat they are to be accepted or rejected, but until our intellects are\nemended we do not have the best perspective from which to see the\ntruth.\n\nDescartes sees little alternative to proceeding as he does. If he just\nasserts the claims that he is certain are true, other individuals who\nare in a position to see those claims as obvious will recognize their\ntruth, but these are not necessarily the individuals whom Descartes is\ntrying to reach. He is also trying to reach a much larger set of\nindividuals: those who disagree with him, and who disagree with him\ndeeply. He must say something to these people, but if they are not in\na position to see the true, he will have to meet them where they are\nor else they will not be prepared to engage. Accordingly, he writes\nthat in the Meditations \u201cI had confined myself to what\nI originally believed quite spontaneously and with nature as my guide,\nand to the commonly held views of others, irrespective of truth or\nfalsity; for my purpose in making the survey was not to adopt these\nbeliefs, but merely to examine them\u201d (Seventh Replies,\nAT 7:482, CSM 2:325). In the Meditations Descartes is working\nto \u201cappeal to a variety of different minds\u201d (First\nReplies, AT 7:120, CSM 2:85). About the many false claims that he\nputs forward therein, he writes\n\nA philosopher would be no more surprised at such suppositions of\nfalsity than he would be if, in order to straighten out a curved\nstick, we bent it round in the opposite direction. The philosopher\nknows that it is often useful to assume falsehoods instead of truths\nin this way in order to shed light on the truth, e.g. when astronomers\nimagine the equator, the zodiac, or other circles in the sky, or when\ngeometers add new lines to given figures. Philosophers frequently do\nthe same. If someone calls this \u2018having recourse to artifice,\nsleight of hand, or circumlocution\u2019 and says it is\n\u2018unworthy of philosophical honesty and the love of truth\u2019\nthen he certainly shows that he himself, so far from being\nphilosophically honest or being prepared to employ any argument at\nall, simply wants to indulge in rhetorical display. (Fifth\nReplies, CSM 2:242)\n\n\nIn Second Replies Descartes makes a distinction between the\nsimple and primary notions of metaphysics \u2013 which are not\nderivable from anything \u2013 and other truths that can be generated\nfrom these (CSM 2:104, 111). A dilemma that he highlights is that if a\nperson is so confused that they do not recognize the truth of primary\nnotions, it is not clear what to say to them. The primary notions are\nnot derived from other notions \u2013 that is what makes\nthem simple and fundamental \u2013 and so they cannot be demonstrated\nor argued for, but if the philosopher just repeats them, that\nwon\u2019t do much good either. A further dilemma, according to\nDescartes, is that primary notions often contradict the everyday\nworldview to which most of us subscribe uncritically (CSM\n2:111\u2013112). If so, we are primed to reject the primary notions\nof metaphysics and the further disorienting conclusions that they\nentail. A philosopher like Descartes needs to say something\nto his audience \u2013 to get them to see the force of his view\n\u2013 but ironically enough, the truth will not cut it, at least not\nat first. What Descartes does, then, is to employ a version of the\nanalytic method of ancient geometry, in which claims are made that\nstrictly speaking are false but that help a student to see\n(eventually) what is true. He will emulate the practice of geometers\nlike Archimedes \u2013 who articulates the nature of a sphere on\nanalogy with a rectilinear figure that is inscribed in a circle, even\nthough the notion of a rectilinear sphere is incoherent (Fourth\nReplies, AT 7:245, CSM 2:170\u2013171). In the First Meditation\nespecially, Descartes will advance claims that are false but that he\nanticipates his readers will find plausible: we will think through the\nimplications of these claims in a way that puts us on course to arrive\nat a clear and distinct grasp of the primary notions of metaphysics.\nOn the way Descartes will make claims \u2013 including modal claims\n\u2013 that range from false to incoherent, but later on we will be\nin a position to juxtapose these against the obvious truths at which\nwe have arrived, and our earlier claims will be seen for the\nconfusions that they are.\n",
