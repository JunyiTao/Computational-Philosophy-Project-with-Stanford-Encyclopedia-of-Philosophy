    "main_text": "On Nature || Perception/Cognition\n2.4 Perception/Cognition\n\nIt is not clear that Empedocles makes a distinction between perception\nand cognition. Certainly the tradition in antiquity, exemplified by\nAristotle, attributes to him only an account of perception, which is\nbased on the following:\n\n\n\nFor it is by earth that we see earth, by water water, \n\nBy aether divine aether, and by fire destructive fire, \n\nAnd fondness by fondness, and strife by baleful strife. (B 109 = D\n207) \n\n\nIf we take \u201csee\u201d (op\u00f4pamen) to mean sense\nperception, then this characterization suggests that such perception\nis by the likeness of external elements to internal elements. Then,\nsince roots and principles in the perceiver are related to the roots\nand principles in the perceived object, the passage suggests that\nelements in one correspond to elements in the other. This passage, of\ncourse, does not make clear how this correspondence results in the\nperception of color and shape. Still, Empedocles is able to explain,\nby way of \u201ceffluences\u201d how the elements in the perceived\nobject affect the elements in the perceiver. Everything gives off\neffluences (B 89 = D 208). These are tiny particles that flow out from\nobjects continually. One can then grasp one half of the\ncorrespondence; effluences from the perceived object flow to the\nperceiver, in particular to the perceptual organ. Then, effluences of\nfire would make contact with the fire in the eye. On this basis, since\nfire, e.g., is white, one can construct an account of the way that\nfire, and the other roots, are responsible for color perception.\nHowever, these sorts of explanation do not encompass the perception of\nLove and Strife, which seems to depend on deduction (B 17.21 = D\n73.252). \n\nIn view of such difficulties, some have argued that B 109 (= D 207)\nimplies a more general notion than sense perception. If\nop\u00f4pamen includes understanding and knowledge (as it\nseems to in the case of Love and Strife), then Empedocles is not\ntalking about the meeting of external and internal elements. Rather,\nhe implies a more abstract operation in which we acquire an\nintellectual grasp of the roots and the forces and do not just\nperceive them (see Kamtekar 2009). However, two recent studies that\nfocus on the perception of color imply that B 109 (= D207) describes\nsense perception (Ierodiakonou 2005 and Kalderon 2015:\n1\u201316).\n\nWhether B 109 is about sense perception or not, in another passage (B\n84 = D 215) Empedocles focuses on the senses when he talks about the\nway the eye functions (trans. Rashed 2007):\n\n\nJust as when someone, before taking to the road, constructs a lamp for\nhimself, \nA flame of gleaming fire in a stormy night, \nFitting, as protection against all winds, lantern casings \nThat scatter the breath of the buffeting winds, \nWhile the light, finer as it is, leaping through to the\noutside, \nShines on the threshold with its unimpaired beams, \nThus, after Aphrodite had fitted the ogygian fire enclosed in\nmembranes with pegs of love, \nShe poured round-eyed Kor\u00ea in filmy veils \nThese kept off the depth of water flowing round about them, \nBut allowed the fire to pass through to the outside, in that it is\nfiner, where they had been bored through with marvellous funnels.\n\n\n\nIn the lantern, the flame is shielded by a linen screen, but the light\nstill goes through the linen. So the eye has a membrane through which\nthe flame within the eye goes out. This account of the eye refers to\nanother important Empedoclean idea: the surface of the eye has\npassages through which the effluent fire goes out. Still, effluences\ngo in the other direction, as well, from the objects. This possibility\nsuggests another important Empedoclean idea. In a well-known passage\nof Plato\u2019s Meno where Socrates is supposed to be giving\nEmpedocles\u2019 theory of perception, effluences come from the\nobject of perception to the organ of perception. In this account there\nis also a way to distinguish the different kinds of perception.\nDifferent sized effluences from the object fit similarly shaped\nopenings or pores in the different organs. Then colors are effluences\nfrom objects fitted to the pores of the eye (A 92 = D 209). So,\nperception of color is based on a correspondence between the shape of\nthe pores in the eye and the shape of the particles that flow from the\nperceived object.\n\nEmpedocles\u2019 portrayal of the functions of the mind also seems\nbased on the philosophy of affinity. Its materialist basis is clear\nfrom Empedocles\u2019 contention that the blood around the heart is\nuniquely suited to cognition:\n\n\n\nNourished in the seas of back-springing blood, \n\nWhere above all is located what humans call thought: \n\nFor the blood around the heart is for humans their thought. (B 105 = D\n240). \n\n\nAs in Parmenides\u2019 account of thought as a \u201cmixture of\nmuch-wandering limbs\u201d (B 16 = D 51), so too in Empedocles\nthinking appears to result from the blended ratio (Palmer\n2019)\u2014in this case, of the mixture of earth, water, air, and\nfire (A 86 = D 237). It has been suggested that the roughly even\ndistribution of the four elements in blood is what makes it so suited\nto cognition (Long 1966). Though both cognition and sense perception\noperate on the basis of affinity, their relationship to one another is\nless clear. According to the traditional interpretation, cognition\ndoes not seem to rely upon the senses. Nor is there a single\n\u201ccommand center\u201d in the blood around the heart, where\neffluences from the sensory organs are relayed to. Instead, cognition\noperates as a sense in its own right. This materialist account of\ncognition has lately been called into question (Curd 2016). As\nEmpedocles is committed to the idea that all things have a share of\nthought (B 110 = D 257), then this must include things that have no\nblood. For humans, pericardial blood might then serve as a command\ncenter for sensory data, for evaluation and judgment.\n\nHowever we interpret the process of cognition, it is clear that\nthought has the potential to dramatically alter an individual\u2019s\nconstitution:\n\n\n\nFor if, leaning upon your firm organs of thought (prapides),\n\n\nWith pure efforts you gaze upon them benevolently, \n\nThey [i.e., the elements] will all be present to you throughout your\nlifetime \n\nAnd many other good things will come to you from them. For these\nthings themselves \n\nAre what makes each thing grow in one\u2019s character, according to\neach person\u2019s nature. \n\nBut if you covet different things, such as those that among men are \n\nCountless miseries that blunt their thoughts, \n\nCertainly they will abandon you quickly, as the time revolves, \n\nIn their desire to rejoin the race that is theirs. \n\nFor know that all things feel (phronesis) and have their\nshare of thought (noema). (B 110 = D 257)\n\n\nAcceptance of Empedocles\u2019 philosophical program is envisioned as\nbeing dependent upon his physicalist doctrine of the mixture of\nelements. Its adoption by the addressee relies on a constitution that\nis receptive to truth. Still, one remains capable of growing in wisdom\n(Sassi 2016). Alternatively, the disciple will increasingly become\ncognitively corrupted, \u201cblunted\u201d. The philosopher\nTheophrastus reports that Empedocles attributed individual\ntemperaments to the more or less favorable mixture of the elements\nwithin blood, which was responsible for intelligent, slothful, and\nimpetuous individuals (B 86 = D 237).\n\nIt is likely not coincidental that the balance of elements in blood\nthat is productive of thought approximates the elemental balance also\nfound within the Sphere under the influence of Love. This would\nsuggest that cognition is to be associated with Love. But the failure\nof perfect cognition should be linked to the imperfections of the\nmixture of the elements in blood, and this must be due to the\nco-presence of Strife (Long 1966).\n",
