    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nThe son of an Anglican clergyman, Whitehead graduated from Cambridge\nin 1884 and was elected a Fellow of Trinity College that same year.\nHis marriage to Evelyn Wade six years later was largely a happy one\nand together they had a daughter (Jessie) and two sons (North and\nEric). After moving to London, Whitehead served as president of the\nAristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923. After moving to Harvard, he\nwas elected to the British Academy in 1931. His moves to both London\nand Harvard were prompted in part by institutional regulations\nrequiring mandatory retirement, although his resignation from\nCambridge was also done partly in protest over how the University had\nchosen to discipline Andrew Forsyth, a friend and colleague whose\naffair with a married woman had become something of a local\nscandal.\n\nIn addition to Russell, Whitehead influenced many other students who\nbecame equally or more famous than their teacher, examiner or\nsupervisor himself. For example: mathematicians G. H. Hardy and J. E.\nLittlewood; mathematical physicists Edmund Whittaker, Arthur\nEddington, and James Jeans; economist J. M. Keynes; and philosophers\nSusanne Langer, Nelson Goodman, and Willard van Orman Quine. Whitehead\ndid not, however, inspire any school of thought during his lifetime,\nand most of his students distanced themselves from parts of his\nteachings that they considered anachronistic. For example:\nWhitehead\u2019s conviction that pure mathematics and applied\nmathematics should not be separated, but cross-fertilize each other,\nwas not shared by Hardy, but seen as a remnant of the fading mixed\nmathematics tradition; after the birth of the theories of relativity\nand quantum physics, Whitehead\u2019s method of abstracting some of\nthe basic concepts of mathematical physics from common experiences\nseemed antiquated compared to Eddington\u2019s method of world\nbuilding, which aimed at constructing an experiment matching world\nfrom mathematical building blocks; when, due to Whitehead\u2019s\njudgment as one of the examiners, Keynes had to rewrite his fellowship\ndissertation, Keynes raged against Whitehead, claiming that Whitehead\nhad not bothered to try to understand Keynes\u2019 novel approach to\nprobability; and Whitehead\u2019s main philosophical\ndoctrine\u2014that the world is composed of deeply interdependent\nprocesses and events, rather than mostly independent material things\nor objects\u2014turned out to be largely the opposite of\nRussell\u2019s doctrine of logical atomism, and his metaphysics was\ndispelled by the logical positivists from their dream land of pure\nscientific philosophy.\n\nDespite the fact that he did not inspire any school of thought during\nhis life, his influence on contemporaries was significant. The\nlate Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Felix\nFrankfurter, wrote:\n\n\nFrom knowledge gained through the years of the personalities who in\nour day have affected American university life, I have for some time\nbeen convinced that no single figure has had such a pervasive\ninfluence as the late Professor Alfred North Whitehead. (New York\nTimes, January 8, 1948)\n\n\nMoreover, Whitehead\u2019s philosophical views posthumously inspired\nthe movement of process philosophy and theology, and today\nWhitehead\u2019s ideas continue to be felt and are revalued in\nvarying degrees in all of the main areas in which he worked. One of\nthe most important factors in recent Whitehead scholarship is the\ngradual publishing of volumes of The Edinburgh Critical Edition of\nthe Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead. Two volumes of\nThe Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead, mainly\ncontaining student notes of lectures and seminars given by\nWhitehead at Harvard from September 1924 until May 1927,\nhave already been published by Edinburgh University Press in\n2017 and 2021 respectively (see the Primary Literature section of the\nBibliography below), and four more volumes are on their\nway. Their publication is a stimulus for Whitehead\nresearchers all over the world, as is clear from the 2020 book edited\nby Brian Henning and Joseph Petek, Whitehead at Harvard,\n1924\u20131925.\n\nA short chronology of the major events in Whitehead\u2019s life is\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n1861\nBorn February 15 in Ramsgate, Isle of Thanet, Kent,\nEngland. \n\n1880\nEnters Trinity College, Cambridge, with a scholarship in\nmathematics. \n\n1884\nElected to the Apostles, the elite discussion club founded by\nTennyson in the 1820s; graduates with a B.A. in Mathematics; elected a\nFellow in Mathematics at Trinity. \n\n1890\nMeets Russell; marries Evelyn Wade. \n\n1903\nElected a Fellow of the Royal Society as a result of his work on\nuniversal algebra, symbolic logic, and the foundations of\nmathematics. \n\n1910\nResigns from Cambridge and moves to London. \n\n1911\nAppointed Lecturer at University College London. \n\n1912\nElected President of both the South-Eastern Mathematical\nAssociation and the London branch of the Mathematical Association for\nthe year 1913. \n\n1914\nAppointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology. \n\n1915\nElected President of the Mathematical Association for the\ntwo-year period 1915\u20131917. \n\n1921\nMeets Albert Einstein. \n\n1922\nElected President of the Aristotelian Society for the one-year\nperiod 1922\u20131923. \n\n1924\nAppointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University.\n\n\n1931\nElected a Fellow of the British Academy. \n\n1937\nRetires from Harvard. \n\n1945\nAwarded Order of Merit. \n\n1947\nDies December 30 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. \n\n\n\n\nMore detailed information about Whitehead\u2019s life can be found in\nthe comprehensive two-volume biography A.N. Whitehead: The Man and\nHis Work (1985, 1990) by Victor Lowe and J.B. Schneewind. Paul\nSchilpp\u2019s The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead\n(1941) also includes a short autobiographical essay, in addition to\nproviding a comprehensive critical overview of Whitehead\u2019s\nthought and a detailed bibliography of his writings.\n\nOther helpful introductions to Whitehead\u2019s work include Victor\nLowe\u2019s Understanding Whitehead (1962), Stephen\nFranklin\u2019s Speaking from the Depths (1990), Thomas\nHosinski\u2019s Stubborn Fact and Creative Advance (1993),\nElizabeth Kraus\u2019 The Metaphysics of Experience (1998),\nRobert Mesle\u2019s Process-Relational Philosophy\n(2008), John Cobb\u2019s Whitehead Word Book (2015) and\nJay McDaniel\u2019s What is Process Thought? (2021).

For a chronology of Whitehead\u2019s major\npublications, readers are encouraged to consult the Primary Literature\nsection of the Bibliography below.\n2. Mathematics and Logic\n\nWhitehead began his academic career at Trinity College, Cambridge\nwhere, starting in 1884, he taught for a quarter of a century. In\n1890, Russell arrived as a student and during the 1890s the two men\ncame into regular contact with one another. According to Russell,\n\n\nWhitehead was extraordinarily perfect as a teacher. He took a personal\ninterest in those with whom he had to deal and knew both their strong\nand their weak points. He would elicit from a pupil the best of which\na pupil was capable. He was never repressive, or sarcastic, or\nsuperior, or any of the things that inferior teachers like to be. I\nthink that in all the abler young men with whom he came in contact he\ninspired, as he did in me, a very real and lasting affection. (1956:\n104)\n\n\nBy the early 1900s, both Whitehead and Russell had completed books on\nthe foundations of mathematics. Whitehead\u2019s 1898 A Treatise\non Universal Algebra had resulted in his election to the Royal\nSociety. Russell\u2019s 1903 The Principles of Mathematics\nhad expanded on several themes initially developed by Whitehead.\nRussell\u2019s book also represented a decisive break from the\nneo-Kantian approach to mathematics Russell had developed six years\nearlier in his Essay on the Foundations of Geometry. Since\nthe research for a proposed second volume of Russell\u2019s\nPrinciples overlapped considerably with Whitehead\u2019s own\nresearch for a planned second volume of his Universal\nAlgebra, the two men began collaboration on what eventually would\nbecome Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). According to\nWhitehead, they initially expected the research to take about a year\nto complete. In the end, they worked together on the project for a\ndecade.\n\nAccording to Whitehead\u2014inspired by Hermann\nGrassmann\u2014mathematics is the study of pattern:\n\n\nmathematics is concerned with the investigation of patterns of\nconnectedness, in abstraction from the particular relata and the\nparticular modes of connection. (1933 [1967: 153])\n\n\nIn his Treatise on Universal Algebra, Whitehead took a\ngeneralized algebra\u2014called \u2018universal\nalgebra\u2019\u2014to be the most appropriate tool for this study or\ninvestigation, but after meeting Giuseppe Peano during the section\ndevoted to logic at the First International Congress of Philosophy in\n1900, Whitehead and Russell became aware of the potential of symbolic\nlogic to become the most appropriate tool to rigorously study\nmathematical patterns.\n\nWith the help of Whitehead, Russell extended Peano\u2019s symbolic\nlogic in order to be able to deal with all types of relations and,\nconsequently, with all the patterns of relatedness that mathematicians\nstudy. In his Principles of Mathematics, Russell gave an\naccount of the resulting new symbolic logic of classes and\nrelations\u2014called \u2018mathematical logic\u2019\u2014as well\nas an outline of how to reconstruct all existing mathematics by means\nof this logic. After that, instead of only being a driving force\nbehind the scenes, Whitehead became the public co-author of Russell of\nthe actual and rigorous reconstruction of mathematics from logic.\nRussell often presented this reconstruction\u2014giving rise to the\npublication of the three Principia Mathematica\nvolumes\u2014as the reduction of mathematics to logic, both\nqua definitions and qua proofs. And since the 1920s,\nfollowing Rudolf Carnap, Whitehead and Russell\u2019s project as well\nas similar reduction-to-logic projects, including the earlier project\nof Gottlob Frege, are classified under the header of\n\u2018logicism\u2019.\n\nHowever, S\u00e9bastian Gandon has highlighted in his 2012 study\nRussell\u2019s Unknown Logicism that Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s logicism project differed in at least one important\nrespect from Frege\u2019s logicism project. Frege adhered to a\nradical universalism, and wanted the mathematical content to be\nentirely determined from within the logical system. Russell and\nWhitehead, however, took into account the consensus, or took a stance\nin the ongoing discussions among mathematicians, with respect to the\nconstitutive features of the already existing,\n\u2018pre-logicized\u2019 branches of mathematics, and then\nevaluated for each branch which of several possible types of relations\nwere best suited to logically reconstruct it, while safeguarding its\ntopic-specific features. Contrary to Frege, Whitehead and Russell\ntempered their urge for universalism to take into account the\ntopic-specificity of the various mathematical branches, and as a\nworking mathematician, Whitehead was well positioned to compare the\npre-logicized mathematics with its reconstruction in the logical\nsystem.\n\nFor Russell, the logicism project originated from the dream of a\nrock-solid mathematics, no longer governed by Kantian intuition, but\nby logical rigor. Hence, the discovery of a devastating\nparadox\u2014later called \u2018Russell\u2019s\nparadox\u2019\u2014at the heart of mathematical logic was a serious\nblow for Russell, and kicked off his search for a theory to prevent\nparadox. He actually came up with several theories, but retained the\nramified theory of types in Principia Mathematica. Moreover,\nthe \u2018logicizing\u2019 of arithmetic required extra-logical\npatchwork: the axioms of reducibility, infinity, and choice. None of\nthis patchwork could ultimately satisfy Russell. His original dream\nevaporated and, looking back later in life, he wrote: \u201cThe\nsplendid certainty which I had always hoped to find in mathematics was\nlost in a bewildering maze\u201d (1959: 157).\n\nWhitehead originally conceived of the logicism project as an\nimprovement upon his algebraic project. Indeed, Whitehead\u2019s\ntransition from the solitary Universal Algebra project to the\njoint Principia Mathematica project was a transition from\nuniversal algebra to mathematical logic as the most appropriate\nsymbolic language to embody mathematical patterns. It entailed a\ngeneralization from the embodiment of absolutely abstract patterns by\nmeans of algebraic forms of variables to their embodiment by means of\npropositional functions of real variables. Hardy was quite right in\nhis review of the first volume of Principia Mathematica when\nhe wrote: \u201cmathematics, one may say, is the science of\npropositional functions\u201d (quoted by Grattan-Guinness 1991:\n173).\n\nWhitehead saw mathematical logic as a tool to guide the\nmathematician\u2019s essential activities of intuiting, articulating,\nand applying patterns, and he did not aim at replacing mathematical\nintuition (pattern recognition) with logical rigor. In the latter\nrespect, Whitehead, from the start, was more like Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 than Russell (cf. Desmet 2016a). Consequently, the\ndiscovery of paradox at the heart of mathematical logic was less of a\nblow to Whitehead than to Russell and, later in life, now and again,\nWhitehead simply reversed the Russellian order of generality and\nimportance, writing that \u201csymbolic logic\u201d only represents\n\u201ca minute fragment\u201d of the possibilities of \u201cthe\nalgebraic method\u201d (1947 [1968: 129]).\n\nFor a more detailed account of the genesis of Principia\nMathematica and Whitehead\u2019s place in the philosophy of\nmathematics, cf. Smith 1953, Code 1985, Grattan-Guinness 2000 and\n2002, Irvine 2009, Bostock 2010, Desmet 2010, N. Griffin et al. 2011,\nN. Griffin & Linsky 2013.\n\nFollowing the completion of Principia, Whitehead and Russell\nbegan to go their separate ways (cf. Ramsden Eames 1989, Desmet &\nWeber 2010, Desmet & Rusu 2012). Perhaps inevitably,\nRussell\u2019s anti-war activities and Whitehead\u2019s loss of his\nyoungest son during World War I led to something of a split between\nthe two men. Nevertheless, the two remained on relatively good terms\nfor the rest of their lives. To his credit, Russell comments in his\nAutobiography that when it came to their political\ndifferences, Whitehead\n\n\nwas more tolerant than I was, and it was much more my fault than his\nthat these differences caused a diminution in the closeness of our\nfriendship. (1956: 100)\n\n3. Physics\n\nEven with the publication of its three volumes, Principia\nMathematica was incomplete. For example, the logical\nreconstruction of the various branches of geometry still needed to be\ncompleted and published. In fact, it was Whitehead\u2019s task to do\nso by producing a fourth Principia Mathematica volume.\nHowever, this volume never saw the light of day. What Whitehead did\npublish were his repeated attempts to logically reconstruct the\ngeometry of space and time, hence extending the logicism project from\npure mathematics to applied mathematics or, put differently, from\nmathematics to physics\u2014an extension which Russell greeted with\nenthusiasm and saw as an important step in the deployment of his new\nphilosophical method of logical analysis.\n\nAt first, Whitehead focused on the geometry of space.\n\nWhen Whitehead and Russell logicized the concept of number, their\nstarting point was our intuition of equinumerous classes of\nindividuals\u2014for example, our recognition that the class of\ndwarfs in the fairy tale of Snow White (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy,\nBashful, Sneezy, Dopey) and the class of days in a week (from Monday\nto Sunday) have \u2018something\u2019 in common, namely, the\nsomething we call \u2018seven.\u2019 Then they logically defined (i)\nclasses C and C\u2032 to be equinumerous when there is a one-to-one\nrelation that correlates each of the members of C with one member of\nC\u2032, and (ii) the number of a class C as the class of all the\nclasses that are equinumerous with C.\n\nWhen Whitehead logicized the space of physics, his starting point was\nour intuition of spatial volumes and of how one volume may contain (or\nextend over) another, giving rise to the (mereo)logical relation of\ncontainment (or extension) in the class of volumes, and to the concept\nof converging series of volumes\u2014think, for example, of a series\nof Russian dolls, one contained in the other, but idealized to ever\nsmaller dolls. Whitehead made all this rigorous and then, crudely put,\ndefined the points from which to further construct the geometry of\nspace.\n\nThere is a striking resemblance between Whitehead\u2019s construction\nof points and the construction of real numbers by Georg Cantor, who\nhad been one of Whitehead and Russell\u2019s main sources of\ninspiration next to Peano. Indeed, Whitehead defined points as\nequivalence classes of converging series of volumes, and Cantor\ndefined real numbers as equivalence classes of converging series of\nrational numbers. Moreover, because Whitehead\u2019s basic\ngeometrical entities of geometry are not (as in Euclid) extensionless\npoints but volumes, Whitehead can be seen as one of the fathers of\npoint-free geometry; and because Whitehead\u2019s basic geometrical\nrelation is the mereological (or part-whole) relation of extension, he\ncan also be seen as one of the founders of mereology (and even, when\nwe take into account his later work on this topic in part IV of\nProcess and Reality, of mereotopology).\n\n\u201cLast night\u201d, Whitehead wrote to Russell on 3 September\n1911,\n\n\nthe idea suddenly flashed on me that time could be treated in exactly\nthe same way as I have now got space (which is a picture of beauty, by\nthe bye). (Unpublished letter kept in The Bertrand Russell Archives at\nMcMaster University)\n\n\nShortly after, Whitehead must have learned about Einstein\u2019s\nSpecial Theory of Relativity (STR) because in a letter to Wildon Carr\non 10 July 1912, Russell suggested to the Honorary Secretary of the\nAristotelian Society that Whitehead possibly might deliver a paper on\nthe principle of relativity, and added: \u201cI know he has been\ngoing into the subject\u201d. Anyhow, in the early years of the\nsecond decade of the twentieth century, Whitehead\u2019s interest\nshifted from the logical reconstruction of the Euclidean space of\nclassical physics to the logical reconstruction of the Minkowskian\nspace-time of the STR.\n\nA first step to go from space to space-time was the replacement of\n(our intuition of) spatial volumes with (our intuition of)\nspatio-temporal regions (or events) as the basis of the construction\n(so that, for example, a point of space-time could be defined as an\nequivalence class of converging spatio-temporal regions). However,\nwhereas Whitehead had constructed the Euclidean distance based on our\nintuition of cases of spatial congruence (for example, of two parallel\nstraight line segments being equally long), he now struggled to\nconstruct the Minkowskian metric in terms of a concept of\nspatio-temporal congruence, based on a kind of merger of our intuition\nof cases of spatial congruence and our intuition of cases of temporal\ncongruence (for example, of two candles taking equally long to burn\nout).\n\nSo, as a second step, Whitehead introduced a second relation in the\nclass of spatio-temporal regions next to the relation of extension,\nnamely, the relation of cogredience, based on our intuition of rest or\nmotion. Whitehead\u2019s use of this relation gave rise to a constant\nk, which allowed him to merge spatial and temporal\ncongruence, and which appeared in his formula for the metric of\nspace-time. When Whitehead equated k with\nc2 (the square of the speed of light) his metric\nbecame equal to the Minkowskian metric.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s most detailed account of this reconstruction of the\nMinkowskian space-time of the STR was given in his 1919 book, An\nEnquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge, but he\nalso offered a less technical account in his 1920 book, The\nConcept of Nature.\n\nWhitehead first learned about Einstein\u2019s General Theory of\nRelativity (GTR) in 1916. He admired Einstein\u2019s new mathematical\ntheory of gravitation, but rejected Einstein\u2019s explanation of\ngravitation for not being coherent with some of our basic intuitions.\nEinstein explained the gravitational motion of a free mass-particle in\nthe neighborhood of a heavy mass as due to the curvature of space-time\ncaused by this mass. According to Whitehead, the theoretical concept\nof a contingently curved space-time does not cohere with our\nmeasurement practices; they are based on the essential uniformity of\nthe texture of our spatial and temporal intuition.\n\nIn general, Whitehead opposed the modern scientist\u2019s attitude of\ndropping the requirement of coherence with our basic intuitions, and\nhe revolted against the issuing bifurcation of nature into the world\nof science and that of intuition. In particular, as Einstein\u2019s\ncritic, he set out to give an alternative rendering of the\nGTR\u2014an alternative that passed not only what Whitehead called\n\u201cthe narrow gauge\u201d, which tests a theory\u2019s empirical\nadequacy, but also what he called \u201cthe broad gauge\u201d, which\ntests its coherence with our basic intuitions.\n\nIn 1920, first in a newspaper article (reprinted in Essays in\nScience and Philosophy), and then in a lecture (published as\nChapter VIII of Concept of Nature), Whitehead made public an\noutline of his alternative to Einstein\u2019s GTR. In 1921, Whitehead\nhad the opportunity to discuss matters with Einstein himself. And\nfinally, in 1922, Whitehead published a book with a more detailed\naccount of his alternative theory of gravitation (ATG)\u2014The\nPrinciple of Relativity.\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electrodynamics\n(unlike Einstein\u2019s GTR) could be conceived as coherent with our\nbasic intuitions\u2014even in its four-dimensional format, namely, by\nelaborating Minkowski\u2019s electromagnetic worldview. Hence,\nWhitehead developed his ATG in close analogy with the theory of\nelectrodynamics. He replaced Einstein\u2019s geometric explanation\nwith an electrodynamics-like explanation. Whitehead explained the\ngravitational motion of a free mass-particle as due to a field action\ndetermined by retarded wave-potentials propagating in a uniform\nspace-time from the source masses to the free mass-particle.\n\nIt is important to stress that Whitehead had no intention of improving\nthe predictive content of Einstein\u2019s GTR, only the explanatory\ncontent. However, Whitehead\u2019s replacement of Einstein\u2019s\nexplanation with an alternative explanation entailed a replacement of\nEinstein\u2019s formulae with alternative formulae; and these\ndifferent formulae implied different predictions. So it would be\nincorrect to say that Whitehead\u2019s ATG is empirically equivalent\nto Einstein\u2019s GTR. What can be claimed, however, is that for a\nlong time Whitehead\u2019s theory was experimentally\nindistinguishable from Einstein\u2019s theory.\n\nIn fact, like Einstein\u2019s GTR, Whitehead\u2019s ATG leads to\nNewton\u2019s theory of gravitation as a first approximation. Also\n(as shown by Eddington in 1924 and J. L. Synge in 1952)\nEinstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s theories of gravitation lead to\nan identical solution for the problem of determining the gravitational\nfield of a single, static, and spherically symmetric body\u2014the\nSchwarzschild solution. This implies, for example, that\nEinstein\u2019s GTR and Whitehead\u2019s ATG lead to the exact same\npredictions not only with respect to the precession of the perihelion\nof Mercury and the bending of starlight in the gravitational field of\nthe sun (as already shown by Whitehead in 1922 and William Temple in\n1924) but also with respect to the red-shift of the spectral lines of\nlight emitted by atoms in the gravitational field of the sun (contrary\nto Whitehead\u2019s own conclusion in 1922, which was based on a\nhighly schematized and soon outdated model of the molecule). Moreover\n(as shown by R. J. Russell and Christoph Wassermann in 1986 and\npublished in 2004) Einstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s theories of\ngravitation also lead to an identical solution for the problem of\ndetermining the gravitational field of a single, rotating, and axially\nsymmetric body\u2014the Kerr solution.\n\nEinstein\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s predictions become different,\nhowever, when considering more than one body. Indeed, Einstein\u2019s\nequation of gravitation is non-linear while Whitehead\u2019s is\nlinear; and this divergence qua mathematics implies a\ndivergence qua predictions in the case of two or more bodies.\nFor example (as shown by G. L. Clark in 1954) the two theories lead to\ndifferent predictions with respect to the motion of double stars. The\npredictive divergence in the case of two bodies, however, is quite\nsmall, and until recently experimental techniques were not\nsufficiently refined to confirm either Einstein\u2019s predictions or\nWhitehead\u2019s, for example, with respect to double stars. In 2008,\nbased on a precise timing of the pulsar B1913+16 in the Hulse-Taylor\nbinary system, Einstein\u2019s predictions with respect to the motion\nof double stars were confirmed, and Whitehead\u2019s refuted (by Gary\nGibbons and Clifford Will). The important fact from the viewpoint of\nthe philosophy of science is not that, since the 1970s, now and again,\na physicist rose to claim the experimental refutation of\nWhitehead\u2019s ATG, but that for decades it was experimentally\nindistinguishable from Einstein\u2019s GTR, hence refuting two modern\ndogmas. First, that theory choice is solely based on empirical facts.\nClearly, next to facts, values\u2014especially aesthetic\nvalues\u2014are at play as well. Second, that the history of science\nis a succession of victories over the army of our misleading\nintuitions, each success of science must be interpreted as a defeat of\nintuition, and a truth cannot be scientific unless it hurts human\nintuition. Surely, we can be scientific without taming the authority\nof our intuition and without engaging in the disastrous race to\ndisenchant nature and humankind.\n\nFor a more detailed account of Whitehead\u2019s involvement with\nEinstein\u2019s STR and GTR, cf. Palter 1960, Von Ranke 1997,\nHerstein 2006 and Desmet 2011, 2016b, and 2016c.\n\nIn 1925, in one of his Lowell lectures (published as Chapter VIII of\nScience and the Modern World), Whitehead made public a\npopular outline of his alternative to Bohr\u2019s solar system view of\nmaterial atoms, but he never published a more detailed\nand technical account of this alternative quantum theory (AQT).\nWhitehead called his AQT, \u2018the theory of primates.\u2019 In it,\nprimates are not apes, of course, but standing\n(or stationary) electromagnetic waves (or vibrations).\nThese waves are different from the\ntraveling electromagnetic waves outside atoms. They\nare not light waves, but standing waves of charge density\ninside atoms, in fact, constituting atoms.\n\nWhitehead was up to date with respect to the old quantum\nmechanics of Planck, Einstein and Bohr. He was as familiar with\nJeans\u2019 Report on Radiation and the Quantum-Theory\n(1914) as with Eddington\u2019s Report on the Relativity Theory\nof Gravitation (1918). And prior to his departure to\nHarvard, on 12 July 1924, Whitehead chaired a\nsymposium\u2014\u201cThe Quantum Theory: How far does it modify the\nmathematical, the physical, and the psychological concepts of\ncontinuity?\u201d\u2014which was part of a joint session of the\nAristotelian Society and the Mind Society. Unfortunately, he did not\nhimself deliver a lecture at that symposium, and the most technical\naccount of his AQT can be found in the student notes of lectures\nWhitehead gave at Harvard, especially in the fall semester of the\nacademic year 1924\u20131925. Whitehead\u2019s lectures, however, were not\nclear-cut presentations, but instances of philosophy in the making.\nMoreover, his philosophy students lacked the necessary knowledge\nof mathematical physics to fully comprehend Whitehead when he\ntalked physics. Consequently, the student notes of Whitehead\u2019s Harvard\nlectures dealing with quantum theory are low quality notes. Ronny\nDesmet, however, has made a first attempt to correct some of the\nmistakes and to reconstruct Whitehead\u2019s AQT in his 2020 paper,\n\u201cWhitehead\u2019s Highly Speculative Lectures on Quantum Theory\u201d\n(Henning & Petek 2020: 154\u2013181), and in his 2022 paper,\n\u201cWhitehead\u2019s 1925 View of Function and Time\u201d (to be published).\n\nIn his AQT, Whitehead conceived of all electrons\nand protons as compositions of standing electromagnetic\nwaves of charge density, which he called \u2018primates\u2019 or \u2018primordial\nelements.\u2019 In Science and the Modern World, Whitehead wrote:\n\u201cWe shall conceive each primordial element as a vibratory ebb and flow\nof an underlying energy, or activity\u201d (1925 [1967: 35]).\nWhen a material atom emits energy, one of\nits composing standing electromagnetic waves\nis transformed into a travelling electromagnetic wave, that is,\ninto light. The energy emitted by an atom is the energy of the\nemitted light, and the action of the emitted light is the product\nof its energy and its period (which is the inverse of its frequency).\nExperiment had revealed that the amounts of energy\nand action of atomic light emission do not form\na continuous, but a discrete spectrum; they are quantized\nphysical variables. In fact, a smallest amount of action\nexists, the quantum of action, given by Planck\u2019s\nconstant, and all measured amounts of action\nof atomic light emission are integer multiples of\nthis quantum of action. Whitehead conceived of electrons and\nprotons as composed of standing electromagnetic waves of\nwhich the action is also always a multiple of the\nquantum of action. And as he conceived of the atomic energy\nemission as a transformation of these standing into traveling\nelectromagnetic waves, it became clear to him that\nthis emission actually involves the decay of\na primate, and that the loss of the\nprimate\u2019s quantized energy and action explains why the\nemitted light has similarly quantized energy and\naction.\n\nContrary to his ATG, Whitehead\u2019s AQT soon became obsolete.\nExperiments revealed that there are more elementary\nparticles than electrons and protons. And, of course, the\nnew quantum mechanics (of Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli,\nand many others) emerged. As Whitehead focused on philosophy\nwhen at Harvard, his knowledge of physics began to be out of\ndate. His own theory, however, showed some similarities with the new\nquantum mechanics. Whitehead\u2019s standing electromagnetic waves, in a\nsense, foreshadowed Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave mechanics. And\nwhereas the discovery of the quantum of action was the\n\u201cphysicist\u2019s nightmare\u201d (Whitehead 2021:93), Whitehead was happy with\nthe increasing importance of the notion of \u2018action\u2019 in\nphysics. Action is an activity through time, and hence\nconfirms Whitehead\u2019s idea that processes, and\nnot instantaneous configurations of inactive masses, are\nfundamental in nature. Moreover, since there is a minimum quantum\nof action, Whitehead interpreted the equation, action\nequals the product of energy and period (which is a duration), by\nsaying: \u201cconcentration of time increases energy\u201d (2021: 93). This\nstatement of Whitehead, in a sense, foreshadowed Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle with respect to energy and time, which was\nformulated two years later. As his AQT thus foreshadowed the new\nquantum mechanics in two respects, one wonders what he thought of this\nnew theory when it emerged. Charles Hartshorne wrote that\nWhitehead definitely saw \u201cHeisenberg\u2019s famous article of 1927 on the\nUncertainty Principle\u201d (2010: 28). Hartshorne was sure about this,\nbecause it was he himself who showed it to Whitehead. But\nthere is (as yet) no evidence that Whitehead seriously studied\nthis paper in particular, or the new quantum mechanics in general.\n\nWhitehead said to his students: \u201cA definite creative act is looked on\nas handing over to physics the ultimate unit\u201d (2021: 41), where the\nultimate unit is Planck\u2019s constant, or, in other words, the quantum of\naction. Clearly, Whitehead thought of the quantum of action\nas an abstract aspect of his ultimate metaphysical building\nblocks, his elementary creative acts or \u2018actual\noccasions,\u2019 and his AQT, like the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of\nelectrodynamics and Whitehead\u2019s ATG, were still at the back of\nhis mind when he developed his metaphysics at Harvard. This may\nwell be the reason why his metaphysics\u2014his process philosophy\u2014has\nbeen conceived by many authors as an interesting framework to\nontologically interpret the mathematical formalism of quantum\nmechanics. And even authors who are not directly inspired by\nWhitehead, often come up with interpretations of quantum\nmechanics that are strikingly Whiteheadian. A good and recent example\nis Carlo Rovelli\u2019s relational interpretation. Rovelli writes:\n\n\nIn the world described by quantum mechanics there is no reality except\nin the relations between physical systems. It isn\u2019t things that\nenter into relations but, rather, relations that ground the notion of\n\u201cthing\u201d. The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of\nobjects: it is a world of events. Things are built by the happenings\nof elementary events: as the philosopher Nelson Goodman wrote in the\n1950s, in a beautiful phrase, \u201cAn object is a monotonous\nprocess.\u201d A stone is a vibration of quanta that maintains its\nstructure for a while, just as a marine wave maintains its identity\nfor a while before melting again into the sea. \u2026 We, like waves\nand like all objects, are a flux of events; we are processes, for a\nbrief time monotonous \u2026 (2017: 115\u2013116)\n\n\nAnd Rovelli adds that in the speculative world of quantum gravity:\n\n\nThere is no longer space which contains the world, and no\nlonger time during the course of which events occur. There\nare elementary processes \u2026 continuously interact[ing] with each\nother. Just as a calm and clear Alpine lake is made up of a rapid\ndance of a myriad of minuscule water molecules, the illusion of being\nsurrounded by continuous space and time is the product of a\nlong-sighted vision of a dense swarming of elementary processes.\n(2017: 158)\n\n4. Philosophy of Science\n\nWhitehead\u2019s reconstruction of the space-time of the STR and his\nATG make clear (i) that his main methodological requirement in the\nphilosophy of science is that physical theories should cohere with our\nintuitions of the relatedness of nature (of the relations of\nextension, congruence, cogredience, causality, etc.), and (ii) that\nhis paradigm of what a theory of physics should be like is the\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory of electrodynamics. And indeed, in his\nphilosophy of science, Whitehead rejects David Hume\u2019s\n\u201csensationalist empiricism\u201d (1929c [1985: 57]) and Isaac\nNewton\u2019s \u201cscientific materialism\u201d (1925 [1967:\n17]). Instead Whitehead promotes (i) a radical empiricist methodology,\nwhich relies on our perception, not only of sense data (colors,\nsounds, smells, etc.) but also of a manifold of natural relations, and\n(ii) an electrodynamics-like worldview, in which the fundamental\nconcepts are no longer simply located substances or bits of matter,\nbut internally related processes and events.\n\n\u201cModern physical science\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\n\n\nis the issue of a coordinated effort, sustained for more than three\ncenturies, to understand those activities of Nature by reason of which\nthe transitions of sense-perception occur. (1934 [2011: 65])\n\n\nBut according to Whitehead, Hume\u2019s sensationalist empiricism has\nundermined the idea that our perception can reveal those activities,\nand Newton\u2019s scientific materialism has failed to render his\nformulae of motion and gravitation intelligible.\n\nWhitehead was dissatisfied with Hume\u2019s reduction of perception\nto sense perception because, as Hume discovered, pure sense perception\nreveals a succession of spatial patterns of impressions of color,\nsound, smell, etc. (a procession of forms of sense data), but it does\nnot reveal any causal relatedness to interpret it (any form of process\nto render it intelligible). In fact, all \u201crelatedness of\nnature\u201d, and not only its causal relatedness, was\n\u201cdemolished by Hume\u2019s youthful skepticism\u201d (1922\n[2004: 13]) and conceived as the outcome of mere psychological\nassociation. Whitehead wrote:\n\n\nSense-perception, for all its practical importance, is very\nsuperficial in its disclosure of the nature of things. \u2026 My\nquarrel with [Hume] concerns [his] exclusive stress upon\nsense-perception for the provision of data respecting Nature.\nSense-perception does not provide the data in terms of which we\ninterpret it. (1934 [2011: 21])\n\n\nWhitehead was also dissatisfied with Newton\u2019s scientific\nmaterialism,\n\n\nwhich presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter, or\nmaterial, spread through space in a flux of configurations. In itself\nsuch a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless. It just does\nwhat it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external\nrelations which do not spring from the nature of its being.\n(1925 [1967: 17])\n\n\nWhitehead rejected Newton\u2019s conception of nature as the\nsuccession of instants of spatial distribution of bits of matter for\ntwo reasons. First: the concept of a \u201cdurationless\u201d\ninstant, \u201cwithout reference to any other instant\u201d, renders\nunintelligible the concepts of \u201cvelocity at an instant\u201d\nand \u201cmomentum at an instant\u201d as well as the equations of\nmotion involving these concepts (1934 [2011: 47]). Second: the concept\nof self-sufficient and isolated bits of matter, having \u201cthe\nproperty of simple location in space and time\u201d (1925 [1967:\n49]), cannot \u201cgive the slightest warrant for the law of\ngravitation\u201d that Newton postulated (1934 [2011: 34]). Whitehead\nwrote:\n\n\nNewton\u2019s methodology for physics was an overwhelming success.\nBut the forces which he introduced left Nature still without meaning\nor value. In the essence of a material body\u2014in its mass, motion,\nand shape\u2014there was no reason for the law of gravitation. (1934\n[2011: 23])\n\nThere is merely a formula for succession. But there is an absence of\nunderstandable causation for that formula for that succession. (1934\n[2011: 53\u201354])\n\n\n\u201cCombining Newton and Hume\u201d, Whitehead summarized,\n\n\nwe obtain a barren concept, namely, a field of perception devoid of\nany data for its own interpretation, and a system of interpretation\ndevoid of any reason for the concurrence of its factors. (1934 [2011:\n25])\n\n\n\u201cTwo conclusions\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\n\n\nare now abundantly clear. One is that sense-perception omits any\ndiscrimination of the fundamental activities within Nature. \u2026\nThe second conclusion is the failure of science to endow its formulae\nfor activity with any meaning. (1934 [2011: 65])\n\n\nThe views of Newton and Hume, Whitehead continued, are \u201cgravely\ndefective. They are right as far as they go. But they omit \u2026\nour intuitive modes of understanding\u201d (1934 [2011: 26]).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s eyes, however, the development of Maxwell\u2019s\ntheory of electromagnetism constituted an antidote to Newton\u2019s\nscientific materialism, for it led him to conceive the whole universe\nas \u201ca field of force\u2014or, in other words, a field of\nincessant activity\u201d (1934 [2011: 27]). The theory of\nelectromagnetism served Whitehead to overcome Newton\u2019s\n\u201cfallacy of simple location\u201d (1925 [1967: 49]), that\nis, the conception of nature as a universe of self-sufficient isolated\nbits of matter. Indeed, we cannot say of an electromagnetic event that\nit is\n\n\nhere in space, and here in time, or here in space-time, in a perfectly\ndefinite sense which does not require for its explanation any\nreference to other regions of space-time. (1925 [1967: 49])\n\n\nThe theory of electromagnetism \u201cinvolves the entire abandonment\nof the notion that simple location is the primary way in which things\nare involved in space-time\u201d because it reveals that, \u201cin a\ncertain sense, everything is everywhere at all times\u201d\n(1925 [1967: 91]). \u201cLong ago\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\nFaraday already remarked \u201cthat in a sense an electric charge is\neverywhere\u201d, and:\n\n\nthe modification of the electromagnetic field at every point of space\nat each instant owing to the past history of each electron is another\nway of stating the same fact. (1920 [1986: 148])\n\n\nThe lesson that Whitehead learned from the theory of electromagnetism\nis unambiguous:\n\n\nThe fundamental concepts are activity and process. \u2026 The notion\nof self-sufficient isolation is not exemplified in modern physics.\nThere are no essentially self-contained activities within limited\nregions. \u2026 Nature is a theatre for the interrelations of\nactivities. All things change, the activities and their\ninterrelations. \u2026 In the place of the procession of [spatial]\nforms (of externally related bits of matter, modern physics) has\nsubstituted the notion of the forms of process. It has thus swept away\nspace and matter, and has substituted the study of the internal\nrelations within a complex state of activity. (1934 [2011:\n35\u201336])\n\n\nBut overcoming Newton was insufficient for Whitehead because Hume\n\u201chas even robbed us of reason for believing that the past gives\nany ground for expectation of the future\u201d (1934 [2011: 65]).\nAccording to Whitehead,\n\n\nscience conceived as resting on mere sense-perception, with no other\nsources of observation, is bankrupt, so far as concerns its claims to\nself-sufficiency. (1934 [2011: 66])\n\n\nIn fact, science conceived as restricting itself to the sensationalist\nmethodology can find neither efficient nor final causality. It\n\u201ccan find no creativity in Nature; it finds mere rules of\nsuccession\u201d (1934 [2011: 66]). \u201cThe reason for this\nblindness\u201d, according to Whitehead, \u201clies in the fact that\nsuch science only deals with half of the evidence provided by human\nexperience\u201d (1934 [2011: 66]).\n\nContrary to Hume, Whitehead held that it is untrue to state that our\nperception, in which sense perception is only one factor, discloses no\ncausal relatedness. Inspired by the radical empiricism of William\nJames and Henri Bergson, Whitehead gave a new analysis of perception.\nAccording to Whitehead, our perception is a symbolic interplay of two\npure modes of perception, pure sense perception (which Whitehead\nultimately called \u201cperception in the mode of presentational\nimmediacy\u201d), and a more basic perception of causal relatedness\n(which he called \u201cperception in the mode of causal\nefficacy\u201d). According to Whitehead, taking into account the\nwhole of our perception instead of only pure sense perception, that\nis, all perceptual data instead of only Hume\u2019s sense data,\nimplies also taking into account the other half of the evidence,\nnamely, our intuitions of the relatedness of nature, of \u201cthe\ntogetherness of things\u201d. He added:\n\n\nthe togetherness of things involves some doctrine of mutual immanence.\nIn some sense or other \u2026 each happening is a factor in the\nnature of every other happening. (1934 [2011: 87])\n\n\nHume demolished the relatedness of nature; Whitehead restored it,\nfounded the \u201cdoctrine of causation \u2026 on the doctrine of\nimmanence\u201d, and wrote: \u201cEach occasion presupposes the\nantecedent world as active in its own nature. \u2026 This is the\ndoctrine of causation\u201d (1934 [2011: 88\u201389]).\n\nWhitehead also noticed that, in a sense, physicists are even more\nreductionist than Hume. In practice they rely on sense data, but in\ntheory they abstract from most of the data of our five senses (sight,\nhearing, smell, taste, and touch) to focus on the colorless,\nsoundless, odorless, and tasteless mathematical aspects of nature.\nConsequently, in a worldview inspired not by the actual practices of\nphysicists, but by their theoretical speculations,\nnature\u2014methodologically stripped from its \u2018tertiary\u2019\nqualities (esthetical, ethical, and religious values)\u2014is further\nreduced to the scientific world of \u2018primary\u2019 qualities\n(mathematical quantities and interconnections such as the amplitude,\nlength, and frequency of mathematical waves), and this scientific\nworld is bifurcated from the world of \u2018secondary\u2019\nqualities (colors, sounds, smells, etc.). Moreover, the former world\nis supposed, ultimately, to fully explain the latter world (so that,\nfor example, colors end up as being nothing more than electromagnetic\nwave-frequencies).\n\nWhitehead spoke of the \u201cbifurcation of nature into two systems\nof reality\u201d (1920 [1986: 30]) to denote the\nstrategy\u2014originating with Galileo, Descartes, Boyle and\nLocke\u2014of bifurcating nature into the essential reality of\nprimary qualities and the non-essential reality of \u201cpsychic\nadditions\u201d or secondary qualities, ultimately to be explained\naway in terms of primary qualities. Whitehead sided with Berkeley in\narguing that the primary/secondary distinction is not tenable (1920\n[1986: 43\u201344]), that all qualities are \u201cin the same boat,\nto sink or swim together\u201d (1920 [1986: 148]), and that, for\nexample,\n\n\nthe red glow of the sunset should be as much part of nature as are the\nmolecules and electric waves by which men of science would explain the\nphenomenon. (1920 [1986: 29])\n\n\nWhitehead described the philosophical outcome of the bifurcation of\nnature as follows:\n\n\nThe primary qualities are the essential qualities of substances whose\nspatio-temporal relationships constitute nature. \u2026 The\noccurrences of nature are in some way apprehended by minds \u2026\nBut the mind in apprehending also experiences sensations which,\nproperly speaking, are qualities of the mind alone. These sensations\nare projected by the mind so as to clothe appropriate bodies in\nexternal nature. Thus the bodies are perceived as with qualities which\nin reality do not belong to them, qualities which in fact are purely\nthe offspring of the mind. Thus nature gets credit which should in\ntruth be reserved for ourselves: the rose for its scent: the\nnightingale for his song: and the sun for his radiance. The poets are\nentirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves, and\nshould turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of\nthe human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless,\ncolourless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly.\n(1925 [1967: 54])\n\n\n\u201cThe enormous success of the scientific abstractions\u201d,\nWhitehead wrote, \u201chas foisted onto philosophy the task of\naccepting them as the most concrete rendering of fact\u201d and, he\nadded:\n\n\nThereby, modern philosophy has been ruined. It has oscillated in a\ncomplex manner between three extremes. There are the dualists, who\naccept matter and mind as on an equal basis, and the two varieties of\nmonists, those who put mind inside matter, and those who put matter\ninside mind. But this juggling with abstractions can never overcome\nthe inherent confusion introduced by the ascription of misplaced\nconcreteness to the scientific scheme. (1925 [1967: 55])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s alternative is fighting \u201cthe Fallacy of\nMisplaced Concreteness\u201d\u2014the \u201cerror of mistaking the\nabstract for the concrete\u201d\u2014because \u201cthis fallacy is\nthe occasion of great confusion in philosophy\u201d (1925 [1967:\n51]). The fallacy of misplaced concreteness is committed each time\nabstractions are taken as concrete facts, and \u201cmore concrete\nfacts\u201d are expressed \u201cunder the guise of very abstract\nlogical constructions\u201d (1925 [1967: 50\u201351]). This\nfallacy lies at the root of the modern philosophical confusions of\nscientific materialism and progressive bifurcation of nature. Indeed,\nthe notion of simple location in Newton\u2019s scientific materialism\nis an instance of the fallacy of misplaced concreteness\u2014it\nmistakes the abstraction of in essence unrelated bits of matter as the\nmost concrete reality from which to explain the relatedness of nature.\nAnd the bifurcating idea that secondary qualities should be explained\nin terms of primary qualities is also an instance of this\nfallacy\u2014it mistakes the mathematical abstractions of physics as\nthe most concrete and so-called primary reality from which to explain\nthe so-called secondary reality of colors, sounds, etc.\n\nIn light of the rise of electrodynamics, relativity, and quantum\nmechanics, Whitehead challenged scientific materialism and the\nbifurcation of nature \u201cas being entirely unsuited to the\nscientific situation at which we have now arrived\u201d, and he\nclearly outlined the mission of philosophy as he saw it:\n\n\nI hold that philosophy is the critic of abstractions. Its function is\nthe double one, first of harmonising them by assigning to them their\nright relative status as abstractions, and secondly of completing them\nby direct comparison with more concrete intuitions of the universe,\nand thereby promoting the formation of more complete schemes of\nthought. It is in respect to this comparison that the testimony of\ngreat poets is of such importance. Their survival is evidence that\nthey express deep intuitions of mankind penetrating into what is\nuniversal in concrete fact. Philosophy is not one among the sciences\nwith its own little scheme of abstractions which it works away at\nperfecting and improving. It is the survey of the sciences, with the\nspecial object of their harmony, and of their completion. It brings to\nthis task, not only the evidence of the separate sciences, but also\nits own appeal to concrete experience.

Philosophy of Education\n\nWhile in London, Whitehead became involved in many practical aspects\nof tertiary education, serving as President of the Mathematical\nAssociation, Dean of the Faculty of Science and Chairman of the\nAcademic Council of the Senate at the University of London, Chairman\nof the Delegacy for Goldsmiths\u2019 College, and several other\nadministrative posts. Many of his essays about education date from\nthis time and appear in his book, The Aims of Education and Other\nEssays (1929a).\n\nAt its core, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy of education emphasizes the\nidea that a good life is most profitably thought of as an educated or\ncivilized life, two terms which Whitehead often uses interchangeably.\nAs we think, we live. Thus it is only as we improve our thoughts that\nwe improve our lives. The result, says Whitehead, is that \u201cThere\nis only one subject matter for education, and that is Life in all its\nmanifestations\u201d (1929a: 10). This view in turn has corollaries\nfor both the content of education and its method of delivery.\n\n(a) With regard to delivery, Whitehead emphasizes the importance of\nremembering that a \u201cpupil\u2019s mind is a growing organism\n\u2026 it is not a box to be ruthlessly packed with alien\nideas\u201d (1929a: 47). Instead, it is the purpose of education to\nstimulate and guide each student\u2019s self-development. It is not\nthe job of the educator simply to insert into his students\u2019\nminds little chunks of knowledge.\n\nWhitehead conceives of the student\u2019s educational process of\nself-development as an organic and cyclic process in which each cycle\nconsists of three stages: first the stage of romance, then the stage\nof precision, and finally, the stage of generalization. The first\nstage is all about \u201cfree exploration, initiated by\nwonder\u201d, the second about the disciplined \u201cacquirement of\ntechnique and detailed knowledge\u201d, and the third about\n\u201cthe free application of what has been learned\u201d (Lowe\n1990: 61). These stages, continually recurring in cycles, determine\nwhat Whitehead calls \u201cThe Rhythm of Education\u201d (cf. 1929a:\n24\u201344). In the context of mathematics, Whitehead\u2019s three\nstages can be conceived of as the stage of undisciplined intuition,\nthe stage of logical reasoning, and the stage of logically guided\nintuition. By skipping stage one, and never arriving at stage three,\nbad math teachers deny students the major motivation to love\nmathematics: the joy of pattern recognition.\n\nThat education does not involve inserting into the student\u2019s\nmind little chunks of knowledge is clear from the description of\nculture that Whitehead offers as the opening of the first and title\nessay of The Aims of Education:\n\n\nCulture is activity of thought, and receptiveness of beauty and humane\nfeeling. Scraps of information have nothing to do with it. (1929a:\n1)\n\n\nOn the contrary, Whitehead writes,\n\n\nwe must beware of what I call \u2018inert ideas\u2019\u2014that is\nto say, ideas that are merely received into the mind without being\nutilized, or tested, or thrown into fresh combinations, (1929a:\n1\u20132)\n\n\nand he holds that \u201ceducation is the acquisition of the art of\nthe [interconnection and] utilization of knowledge\u201d (1929a: 6),\nand that ideas remain disconnected and non-utilized unless they are\nrelated\n\n\nto that stream, compounded of sense perceptions, feelings, hopes,\ndesires, and of mental activities adjusting thought to thought, which\nforms our life. (1929a: 4)\n\n\nThis point\u2014the point where Whitehead links the art of education\nto the stream of experience that forms our life\u2014is the meeting\npoint of Whitehead\u2019s philosophy of education with his philosophy\nof experience, which is also called: \u2018process\nphilosophy.\u2019\n\nAccording to Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy, the stream of\nexperience that forms our life consists of occasions of experience,\neach of which is a synthesis of many feelings having objective content\n(what is felt) and subjective form (how it is felt); also, the\nsynthesis of feelings is not primarily controlled by their objective\ncontent, but by their subjective form. According to Whitehead\u2019s\nphilosophy of education, the attempt to educate a person by merely\nfocusing on objective content\u2014on inert ideas, scraps of\ninformation, bare knowledge\u2014while disregarding the subjective\nform or emotional pattern of that person\u2019s experience can never\nbe successful. The art of education has to take into account the\nsubjective receptiveness and appreciation of beauty and human\ngreatness, the subjective emotions of interest, joy and adventure, and\n\u201cthe ultimate motive power\u201d (1929a: 62), that is, the\nsense of importance, values and possibilities (cf.1929a:\n45\u201365).\n\n(b) With regard to content, Whitehead holds that any adequate\neducation must include a literary component, a scientific component,\nand a technical component.\n\nAccording to Whitehead:\n\n\nAny serious fundamental change in the intellectual outlook of human\nsociety must necessarily be followed by an educational revolution.\n(1929a: 116)\n\n\nIn particular, the scientific revolution and the fundamental changes\nit entailed in the seventeenth and subsequent centuries have been\nfollowed by an educational revolution that was still ongoing in the\ntwentieth century. In 1912, Whitehead wrote:\n\n\nWe are, in fact, in the midst of an educational revolution caused by\nthe dying away of the classical impulse which has dominated European\nthought since the time of the Renaissance. \u2026 What I mean is the\nloss of that sustained reference to classical literature for the sake\nof finding in it the expression of our best thoughts on all subjects.\n\u2026 There are three fundamental changes \u2026 Science now\nenters into the very texture of our thoughts \u2026 Again,\nmechanical inventions, which are the product of science, by altering\nthe material possibilities of life, have transformed our industrial\nsystem, and thus have changed the very structure of Society. Finally,\nthe idea of the World now means to us the whole round world of human\naffairs, from the revolutions of China to those of Peru. \u2026 The\ntotal result of these changes is that the supreme merit of immediate\nrelevance to the full compass of modern life has been lost to\nclassical literature. (1947 [1968: 175\u2013176])\n\n\nWhitehead listed the scientific and industrial revolutions as well as\nglobalization as the major causes for the educational reforms of the\nnineteenth and twentieth century. These fundamental changes indeed\nimplied new standards for what counts as genuine knowledge. However,\ntogether with these new standards emerged a romantic anxiety\u2014the\nanxiety that the new standards of genuine knowledge, education, and\nliving might impoverish human experience and damage both individual\nand social wellbeing. Hence arose the bifurcation of culture into the\nculture of \u201cnatural scientists\u201d and the culture of\n\u201cliterary intellectuals\u201d (cf. Snow 1959), and the many\nassociated debates in the context of various educational\nreforms\u2014for example, the 1880s debate in Victorian England, when\nWhitehead was a Cambridge student, between T. H. Huxley, an outspoken\nchampion of science, defending the claims of modern scientific\neducation, and Matthew Arnold, a leading man of letters, defending the\nclaims of classical literary education.\n\nAs for Whitehead, in whom the scientific and the romantic spirit\nmerged, one cannot say that he sided with either Huxley or Arnold. He\ntook his distance from those who, motivated by the idea that the\nsciences embody the ultimate modes of thought, sided with Huxley, but\nalso from those who, motivated by conservatism, that is, by an\nanachronistic longing for a highly educated upper class and an elitist\nhorror of educational democratization, sided with Arnold (cf. 1947\n[1968: 23\u201324]). Next to not taking a stance in the debate on\nwhich is the ultimate mode of thought, the scientific or the literary,\nhence rejecting the antithesis between scientific and literary\neducation, Whitehead also rejected the antithesis between thought and\naction (cf. 1947 [1968: 172]) and hence, between a liberal, that is,\nmainly intellectual and theoretical, education, and a technical, that\nis, mainly manual and practical, education (cf. 1929a: 66\u201392).\nIn other words, according to Whitehead, we can identify three instead\nof two cultures but, moreover, we must refrain from promoting any one\nof these three at the expense of the other two. He writes:\n\n\nMy point is, that no course of study can claim any position of ideal\ncompleteness. Nor are the omitted factors of subordinate importance.\nThe insistence in the Platonic culture on disinterested intellectual\nappreciation is a psychological error. Action and our implication in\nthe transition of events amid the inevitable bond of cause to effect\nare fundamental. An education which strives to divorce intellectual or\naesthetic life from these fundamental facts carries with it the\ndecadence of civilisation. (1929a: 73)\n\nDisinterested scientific curiosity is a passion for an ordered\nintellectual vision of the connection of events. But the \u2026\nintervention of action even in abstract science is often overlooked.\nNo man of science wants merely to know. He acquires knowledge to\nappease his passion for discovery. He does not discover in order to\nknow, he knows in order to discover. The pleasure which art and\nsciences can give to toil is the enjoyment which arises from\nsuccessfully directed intention. (1929a: 74)\n\nThe antithesis between a technical and a liberal education is\nfallacious. There can be no technical education which is not liberal,\nand no liberal education which is not technical: that is, no education\nwhich does not import both technique and intellectual vision. (1929a:\n74)\n\nThere are three main methods which are required in a national system\nof education, namely, the literary curriculum, the scientific\ncurriculum, the technical curriculum. But each of these curricula\nshould include the other two \u2026 each of these sides \u2026\nshould be illuminated by the others. (1929a: 75)\n\n\nFor more details and an extensive bibliography on Whitehead\u2019s\nphilosophy of education, cf. Part VI of Volume 1 of the Handbook\nof Whiteheadian Process Thought (Weber & Desmond 2008:\n185\u2013214). For some recent Whiteheadian contributions to\nEducating for an Ecological Civilization, see Ford &\nRowe (eds.) 2017.\n6. Metaphysics\n\nFacing mandatory retirement in London, and upon being offered an\nappointment at Harvard, Whitehead moved to the United States in 1924.\nGiven his prior training in mathematics, it was sometimes joked that\nthe first philosophy lectures he ever attended were those he himself\ndelivered in his new role as Professor of Philosophy. As Russell\ncomments, \u201cIn England, Whitehead was regarded only as a\nmathematician, and it was left to America to discover him as a\nphilosopher\u201d (1956: 100).\n\nA year after his arrival, he delivered Harvard\u2019s prestigious\nLowell Lectures. The lectures formed the basis for Science and the\nModern World (1926). The 1927/28 Gifford Lectures at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh followed shortly afterwards and resulted in\nthe publication of Whitehead\u2019s most comprehensive (but difficult\nto penetrate) metaphysical work, Process and Reality (1929c).\nAnd in the Preface of the third major work composing his mature\nmetaphysical system, Adventures of Ideas (1933), Whitehead\nstated:\n\n\nThe three books\u2014Science and The Modern World, Process and\nReality, Adventures of Ideas\u2014are an endeavor to express a\nway of understanding the nature of things, and to point out how that\nway of understanding is illustrated by \u2026 human experience. Each\nbook can be read separately; but they supplement each other\u2019s\nomissions or compressions. (1933 [1967: vii])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy of science \u201chas nothing to do with\nethics or theology or the theory of aesthetics\u201d (1922 [2004:\n4]). Whitehead in his London writings was \u201cexcluding any\nreference to moral or aesthetic values\u201d, even though he was\nalready aware that \u201cthe values of nature are perhaps the key to\nthe metaphysical synthesis of existence\u201d (1920 [1986: 5]).\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics, on the contrary, not only take into\naccount science, but also art, morals and religion. Whitehead in his\nHarvard writings did not exclude anything, but aimed at a\n\u201csynoptic vision\u201d (1929c [1985: 5]) to which values are\nindeed the key.\n\nIn his earlier philosophy of science, Whitehead revolted against the\nbifurcation of nature into the worlds of primary and secondary\nqualities, and he promoted the harmonization of the abstractions of\nmathematical physics with those of Hume\u2019s sensationalist\nempiricism, as well as the inclusion of more concrete intuitions\noffered by our perception\u2014our intuitions of causality,\nextension, cogredience, congruence, color, sound, smell, etc. Closely\nlinked to this completion of the scientific scheme of thought,\nWhitehead developed a new scientific ontology and a new theory of\nperception. His scientific ontology is one of internally related\nevents (instead of merely externally related bits of matter). His\ntheory of perception (cf. Symbolism: its Meaning and Effect)\nholds that our perception is always perception in the mixed mode of\nsymbolic reference, which usually involves a symbolic reference of\nwhat is given in the pure mode of presentational immediacy to what is\ngiven in the pure mode of causal efficacy:\n\n\nsymbolic reference, though in complex human experience it works both\nways, is chiefly to be thought of as the elucidation of percepta in\nthe mode of causal efficacy by \u2026 percepta in the mode of\npresentational immediacy. (1929c [1985: 178])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the failure to lay due emphasis on the\nperceptual mode of causal efficacy implies the danger of reducing the\nscientific method to Hume\u2019s sensationalist empiricism, and\nultimately lies at the basis of the Humean failure to acknowledge the\nrelatedness of nature, especially the causal relatedness of nature.\nIndeed, \u201cthe notion of causation arose because mankind lives\namid experiences in the mode of causal efficacy\u201d (1929c [1985:\n175]). According to Whitehead, \u201csymbolic reference is the\ninterpretative element in human experience\u201d (1929c [1985: 173]),\nand \u201cthe failure to lay due emphasis on symbolic reference\n\u2026 has reduced the notion of \u2018meaning\u2019 to a\nmystery\u201d (1929c [1985: 168]), and ultimately lies at the basis\nof Newton\u2019s failure to give meaning to his formulae of motion\nand gravitation.\n\nIn his later metaphysics, Whitehead revolted against the bifurcation\nof the world into the objective world of facts (as studied by science,\neven a completed science, and one not limited to physics, but\nstretching from physics to biology to psychology) and the subjective\nworld of values (aesthetic, ethic, and religious), and he promoted the\nharmonization of the abstractions of science with those of art,\nmorals, and religion, as well as the inclusion of more concrete\nintuitions offered by our experience\u2014stretching from our\nmathematical and physical intuitions to our poetic and mystic\nintuitions. Closely linked to this completion of the metaphysical\nscheme of thought (cf. Part I of Process and Reality),\nWhitehead refined his earlier ontology, and generalized his earlier\ntheory of perception into a theory of feelings. Whitehead\u2019s\nultimate ontology\u2014the ontology of \u2018the philosophy of\norganism\u2019 or \u2018process philosophy\u2019\u2014is one of\ninternally related organism-like elementary processes (called\n\u2018actual occasions\u2019 or \u2018actual entities\u2019) in\nterms of which he could understand both lifeless nature and nature\nalive, both matter and mind, both science and\nreligion\u2014\u201cPhilosophy\u201d, Whitehead even writes,\n\u201cattains its chief importance by fusing the two, namely,\nreligion and science, into one rational scheme of thought\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 15]). His theory of feelings (cf. part III of\nProcess and Reality) claims that not only our perception, but\nour experience in general is a stream of elementary processes of\nconcrescence (growing together) of many feelings into\none\u2014\u201cthe many become one, and are increased with\none\u201d (1929c [1985: 21])\u2014and that the process of\nconcrescence is not primarily driven by the objective content of the\nfeelings involved (their factuality), but by their subjective form\n(their valuation, cf. 1929c [1985: 240]).\n\nWhitehead\u2019s ontology cannot be disjoined from his theory of\nfeelings. The actual occasions ontologically constituting our\nexperience are the elementary processes of concrescence of\nfeelings constituting the stream of our experience, and they throw\nlight on the what and the how of all actual\noccasions, including those that constitute lifeless material things.\nThis amounts to the panexperientialist claim that the intrinsically\nrelated elementary constituents of all things in the universe, from\nstones to human beings, are experiential. Whitehead writes:\n\u201ceach actual entity is a throb of experience\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 190]) and \u201capart from the experiences of subjects there\nis nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness\u201d (1929c [1985:\n167])\u2014an outrageous claim according to some, even when it is\nmade clear that panexperientialism is not the same as panpsychism,\nbecause \u201cconsciousness presupposes experience, and not\nexperience consciousness\u201d (1929c [1985: 53]).\n\nThe relational event ontology that Whitehead developed in his London\nperiod might serve to develop a relational interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, such as Rovelli\u2019s (cf. supra) or one of the many\nproposed by Whitehead scholars (cf. Stapp 1993 and 2007, Malin 2001,\nH\u00e4ttich 2004, Epperson 2004, Epperson & Zafiris 2013). But\nthen this ontology has to take into account the fact that quantum\nmechanics suggests that reality is not only relational, but also\ngranular (the results of measuring its changes do not form continuous\nspectra, but spectra of discrete quanta) and indeterminist (physicists\ncannot predetermine the result of a measurement; they can only\ncalculate for each of the relevant discrete quanta, that is, for each\nof the possible results of the measurement, the probability that it\nbecomes the actual result).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s London writings, there is no \u201catomic structure\u201d\nof events (1920 [1986: 59]). The events constituting the passage\nof nature, and underlying the abstraction of a continuous\nspace-time, were continuous events. In his first academic year at\nHarvard, however, Whitehead changed his mind. Henceforth he\nconceived of the passage of nature as atomic, as constituted by atomic\nevents. In The Emergence of Whitehead\u2019s Metaphysics:\n1925\u20131929, Lewis Ford had already given an account of\nthe change in Whitehead\u2019s thought from continuous to atomic\nbecoming in the spring of 1925 (1984: 51\u201365). In \u201cFrom Physics to\nPhilosophy, and from Continuity to Atomicity\u201d (Henning &\nPetek 2020: 132\u2013153), Ronny Desmet confirmed Ford\u2019s account\nby means of a close reading of The Harvard Lectures\nof Alfred North Whitehead 1924\u20131925. Moreover, Desmet made\nclear that the main reason for Whitehead\u2019s change of mind was not\nthe rise of quantum mechanics, nor the fact that the atomicity of\nbecoming provided a solution to Zeno\u2019s paradox of becoming, nor\neven that it was needed to include contingency and freedom in his\nphilosophy. The main raison was that\nthis atomicity prevented his philosophy to\ncontradict our immediate experience of the irreversibility\nof time. But no matter its reason, the introduction of the\natomicity of becoming in Whitehead\u2019s philosophy implied the\ngranularity and indeterminism of reality that are needed, next to its\nrelationality, to develop a feasible interpretation of\nquantum mechanics within the frame of this philosophy.\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s Process and Reality, \u201cthe\nmysterious quanta of energy have made their appearance\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 78]), \u201cthe ultimate metaphysical truth is atomism\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 35]), and events are seen as networks (or\n\u2018societies\u2019) of elementary and atomic events, called\n\u2018actual occasions\u2019 or \u2018actual entities.\u2019\nWhitehead writes:\n\n\nI shall use the term \u2018event\u2019 in the more general sense of\na nexus of actual occasions \u2026 An actual occasion is the\nlimiting type of an event with only one member. (1929c [1985: 73])\n\n\nEach actual occasion determines a quantum of\nextension\u2014\u201cthe atomized quantum of extension correlative\nto the actual entity\u201d (1929c [1985: 73])\u2014and it is by\nmeans of the relation of extensive connection in the class of the\nregions constituted by these quanta that Whitehead attempted to\nimprove upon his earlier construction of space-time (cf. Part IV of\nProcess and Reality).\n\nThe atomicity of events in quantum mechanics dovetails with the\natomicity of the stream of experience as conceived by William James,\nhence reinforcing Whitehead\u2019s claim that each actual entity is\nan elementary process of experience. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nThe authority of William James can be quoted in support of this\nconclusion. He writes: \u201cEither your experience is of no content,\nof no change, or it is of a perceptible amount of content or change.\nYour acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of\nperception. Intellectually and on reflection you can divide these into\ncomponents, but as immediately given, they come totally or not at\nall\u201d. (1929c [1985: 68])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s conclusion reads: \u201cactual entities are drops\nof experience, complex and interdependent\u201d (1929c [1985: 18]),\nand he expresses that reality grows by drops, which together form the\nextensive continuum, by writing: \u201cextensiveness becomes, but\n\u2018becoming is not itself extensive\u201d, and \u201cthere is a\nbecoming of continuity, but no continuity of becoming\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 35]).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s London writings, he aims at logically\nreconstructing Einstein\u2019s STR and GTR, which are both\ndeterministic theories of physics, and his notion of causality (that\neach occasion presupposes the antecedent world as active in its own\nnature) does not seem to leave much room for any creative\nself-determination. In his Harvard writings, however, Whitehead\nconsiders deterministic interaction as an abstract limit in\nsome circumstances of the creative interaction that governs\nthe becoming of actual entities in all circumstances, and he\nmakes clear that his notion of causality includes both determination\nby the antecedent world (efficient causation of past actual occasions)\nand self-determination (final causation by the actual occasion in the\nprocess of becoming). Whitehead writes:\n\n\nAn actual entity is at once the product of the efficient past, and is\nalso, in Spinoza\u2019s phrase, causa sui. Every philosophy\nrecognizes, in some form or other, this factor of self-causation.\n(1929a: 150)\n\n\nAgain: \u201cSelf-realization is the ultimate fact of facts. An\nactuality is self-realizing, and whatever is self-realizing is an\nactuality\u201d (1929a: 222).\n\nIntroducing indeterminism also means introducing potentiality next to\nactuality, and indeed, Whitehead introduces pure potentials, also\ncalled \u2018eternal objects,\u2019 next to actual occasions:\n\n\nThe eternal objects are the pure potentials of the universe, and the\nactual entities differ from each other in their realization of\npotentials. (1929c [1985: 149])\n\n\nEternal objects can qualify (characterize) the objective content and\nthe subjective form of the feelings that constitute actual entities.\nEternal objects of the objective species are pure\nmathematical patterns: \u201cEternal objects of the objective species\nare the mathematical Platonic forms\u201d (1929c [1985: 291]). An\neternal object of the objective species can only qualify the objective\ncontent of a feeling, and \u201cnever be an element in the\ndefiniteness of a subjective form\u201d (idem). Eternal objects of\nthe subjective species, on the other hand, include sense data\nand values.\n\n\nA member of the subjective species is, in its primary character, an\nelement in the definiteness of the subjective form of a feeling. It is\na determinate way in which a feeling can feel. (idem)\n\n\nBut it can also become an eternal object contributing to the\ndefiniteness of the objective content of a feeling, for example, when\na smelly feeling gives rise to a feeling of that smell, or when an\nemotionally red feeling is felt by another feeling, and red, an\nelement of the subjective form of the first feeling, becomes an\nelement of the objective content of the second feeling.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s concept of self-determination cannot be disjoined\nfrom his idea that each actual entity is an elementary process of\nexperience, and hence, according to Whitehead, it is relevant both at\nthe lower level of indeterminist physical interactions and at the\nhigher level of free human interactions. Indeed, each actual entity is\na concrescence of feelings of the antecedent world, which do not only\nhave objective content, but also subjective form, and as this\nconcrescence is not only determined by the objective content (by\nwhat is felt), but also by the subjective form (by\nhow it is felt), it is not only determined by the antecedent\nworld that is felt, but also by how it is felt. In other\nwords, each actual entity has to take into account its past, but that\npast only conditions and does not completely determine how\nthe actual entity will take it into account, and \u201chow\nan actual entity becomes constitutes what that\nactual entity is\u201d (1929c [1985: 23]).\n\nHow does this relate to eternal objects? How an actual entity\ntakes into account its antecedent world involves \u201cthe\nrealization of eternal objects [or pure potentials] in the\nconstitution of the actual entity in question\u201d (1929c [1985:\n149]), and this is partly decided by the actual entity itself. In\nfact, \u201cactuality is the decision amid\npotentiality\u201d (1929c [1985: 43]). Another way of\nstating the same is that \u201cthe subjective form \u2026 has the\ncharacter of a valuation\u201d and\n\n\naccording as the valuation is a \u2018valuation up\u2019 or \u2018a\nvaluation down,\u2019 the importance of the eternal object [or pure\npotentials] is enhanced, or attenuated. (1929c [1985:\n240\u2013241])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, self-determination gives rise to the\nprobabilistic laws of science as well as human freedom. We cannot\ndecide what the causes are of our present moment of experience,\nbut\u2014to a certain extent\u2014we can decide how we take them\ninto account. In other words, we cannot change what happens to us, but\nwe can choose how we take it. Because our inner life is constituted\nnot only by what we feel, but also by how we feel what we feel, not\nonly by objective content, but also by subjective form, Whitehead\nargues that outer compulsion and efficient causation do not have the\nlast word in our becoming; inner self-determination and final\ncausation do.\n\nWhitehead completes his metaphysics by introducing God (cf. Part V of\nProcess and Reality) as one of the elements to further\nunderstand self-determination (and that it does not result in chaos or\nmere repetition, but promotes order and novelty) and final causation\n(and that it ultimately aims at \u201cintensity of feeling\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 27]) or \u201cdepth of satisfaction\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 105])). According to Whitehead: \u201cGod is the organ of\nnovelty\u201d and order (1929c [1985: 67]);\n\n\nApart from the intervention of God, there could be nothing new in the\nworld, and no order in the world. The course of creation would be a\ndead level of ineffectiveness, with all balance and intensity\nprogressively excluded by the cross currents of incompatibility;\n(1929c [1985: 247])\n\n\nand \u201cGod\u2019s purpose in the creative advance is the\nevocation of intensities\u201d (1929c [1985: 105]). Actually, this\nlast quote from Process and Reality is the equivalent of an\nearlier quote from Religion in the Making\u2014\u201cThe\npurpose of God is the attainment of value in the world\u201d (1926b\n[1996: 100])\u2014and a later quote from Adventures of\nIdeas\u2014\u201cThe teleology of the Universe is directed to\nthe production of Beauty\u201d (1933 [1967: 265]). Each actual\noccasion does not only feel its antecedent world (its past), but God\nas well, and it is the feeling of God which constitutes the initial\naim for the actual occasion\u2019s becoming\u2014\u201cHis\n[God\u2019s] tenderness is directed towards each actual occasion, as\nit arises\u201d (1929c [1985: 105]). Again, however, the actual\noccasion is \u201cfinally responsible for the decision by which any\nlure for feeling is admitted to efficiency\u201d (1929c [1985: 88]),\neven if that lure is divine. In other words, each actual occasion is\n\u201cconditioned, though not determined, by an initial subjective\naim supplied by the ground of all order and originality\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 108]).\n\nFor more details on Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics, cf. the books\nlisted in section 1 as well as Emmet 1932, Johnson 1952, Eisendrath\n1971, Lango 1972, Connelly 1981, Ross 1983, Ford 1984, Nobo 1986,\nMcHenry 1992, Jones 1998, Basile 2009, Nordsieck 2015,\nDebaise 2017b, Dombrowski 2017, Stengers 2020, and Raud 2021.\n7. Religion\n\nAs Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy gave rise to the movement of\nprocess theology, most philosophers think that his take on religion\nwas merely positive. This commonplace is wrong. Whitehead wrote:\n\n\nReligion is by no means necessarily good. It may be very evil.\n(1926 [1996: 17])\n\nIn considering religion, we should not be obsessed by the idea of its\nnecessary goodness. This is a dangerous delusion. (1926 [1996:\n18])\n\nIndeed history, down to the present day, is a melancholy record of the\nhorrors which can attend religion: human sacrifice, and in particular,\nthe slaughter of children, cannibalism, sensual orgies, abject\nsuperstition, hatred as between races, the maintenance of degrading\ncustoms, hysteria, bigotry, can all be laid at its charge. Religion is\nthe last refuge of human savagery. The uncritical association of\nreligion with goodness is directly negatived by plain facts.\n(1926 [1996: 37])\n\n\nThis being said, Whitehead didn\u2019t hold that religion is\nmerely negative. To him, religion can be \u201cpositive or\nnegative, good or bad\u201d (1926 [1996: 17]). So after\nhighlighting that the necessary goodness of religion is a dangerous\ndelusion in Religion in the Making, Whitehead abruptly adds:\n\u201cThe point to notice is its transcendent importance\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 18]). In Science and the Modern World,\nWhitehead expresses this transcendent importance of religion as\nfollows:\n\n\nReligion is the vision of something which stands beyond, behind, and\nwithin, the passing flux of immediate things; something which is real,\nand yet waiting to be realized; something which is a remote\npossibility, and yet the greatest of present facts; something that\ngives meaning to all that passes, and yet eludes all apprehension;\nsomething whose possession is the final good, and yet is beyond all\nreach; something which is the ultimate ideal, and the hopeless quest.\n(1925 [1967: 191\u2013192])\n\n\nAnd after pointing out that religion is the last refuge of human\nsavagery in Religion in the Making, Whitehead abruptly adds:\n\u201cReligion can be, and has been, the main instrument for\nprogress\u201d (1926 [1996: 37\u201338]). In Science and\nthe Modern World this message reads:\n\n\nReligion has emerged into human experience mixed with the crudest\nfantasies of barbaric imagination. Gradually, slowly, steadily the\nvision recurs in history under nobler form and with clearer\nexpression. It is the one element in human experience which\npersistently shows an upward trend. It fades and then recurs. But when\nit renews its force, it recurs with an added richness and purity of\ncontent. The fact of the religious vision, and its history of\npersistent expansion, is our one ground for optimism.\n(1925 [1967: 192])\n\n\nWith respect to the relationship between science and religion,\nWhitehead\u2019s view clearly differs from Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s\nview that religion and science do not overlap. Gould wrote:\n\n\nThe lack of conflict between science and religion arises from a lack\nof overlap between their respective domains of professional\nexpertise\u2014science in the empirical constitution of the universe,\nand religion in the search for proper ethical values and the spiritual\nmeaning of our lives. (1997)\n\n\nWhitehead, on the contrary, wrote: \u201cYou cannot shelter theology\nfrom science, or science from theology\u201d (1926 [1996: 79]).\nAnd: \u201cThe conflict between science and religion is what\nnaturally occurs in our minds when we think of this subject\u201d\n(1926 [1967: 181]).\n\nHowever, Whitehead did not agree with those who hold that the ideal\nsolution of the science-religion conflict is the complete annihilation\nof religion. Whitehead, on the contrary, held that we should aim at\nthe integration of science and religion, and turn the impoverishing\nopposition between the two into an enriching contrast. According to\nWhitehead, both religion and science are important, and he wrote:\n\n\nWhen we consider what religion is for mankind, and what science is, it\nis no exaggeration to say that the future course of history depends\nupon the decision of this generation as to the relation between them.\n(1925 [1967: 181])\n\n\nWhitehead never sided with those who, in the name of science, oppose\nreligion with a misplaced and dehumanizing rhetoric of disenchantment,\nnor with those who, in the name of religion, oppose science with a\nmisplaced and dehumanizing exaltation of existent religious dogmas,\ncodes of behavior, institutions, rituals, etc. As Whitehead wrote:\n\u201cThere is the hysteria of depreciation, and there is the\nopposite hysteria which dehumanizes in order to exalt\u201d (1927\n[1985: 91]). Whitehead, on the contrary, urged both scientific and\nreligious leaders to observe \u201cthe utmost toleration of variety\nof opinion\u201d (1925 [1967: 187]) as well as the following\nadvice:\n\n\nEvery age produces people with clear logical intellects, and with the\nmost praiseworthy grip of the importance of some sphere of human\nexperience, who have elaborated, or inherited, a scheme of thought\nwhich exactly fits those experiences which claim their interest. Such\npeople are apt resolutely to ignore, or to explain away, all evidence\nwhich confuses their scheme with contradictory instances. What they\ncannot fit in is for them nonsense. An unflinching determination to\ntake the whole evidence into account is the only method of\npreservation against the fluctuating extremes of fashionable opinion.\nThis advice seems so easy, and is in fact so difficult to follow\n(1925 [1967: 187]).\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s advice of taking the whole evidence into account\nimplies taking the inner life of religion into account and not only\nits external life:\n\n\nLife is an internal fact for its own sake, before it is an external\nfact relating itself to others. The conduct of external life is\nconditioned by environment, but it receives its final quality, on\nwhich its worth depends, from the internal life which is the\nself-realization of existence. Religion is the art and the theory of\nthe internal life of man, so far as it depends on the man himself and\non what is permanent in the nature of things.\n\nThis doctrine is the direct negation of the theory that religion is\nprimarily a social fact. Social facts are of great importance to\nreligion, because there is no such thing as absolutely independent\nexistence. You cannot abstract society from man; most psychology is\nherd-psychology. But all collective emotions leave untouched the awful\nultimate fact, which is the human being, consciously alone with\nitself, for its own sake.\n\nReligion is what the individual does with his own solitariness.\n(1926 [1996: 15\u201316])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s advice also implies the challenge to continually\nreshape the outer life of religion in accord with the scientific\ndevelopments, while remaining faithful to its inner life. When taking\ninto account science, religion runs the risk of collapsing. Indeed,\nwhile reshaping its outer life, religion can only avoid implosion by\nremaining faithful to its inner life. \u201cReligions commit\nsuicide\u201d, according to Whitehead, when do they not find\n\u201ctheir inspirations \u2026 in the primary expressions of the\nintuitions of the finest types of religious lives\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 144]). And he writes:\n\n\nReligion, therefore, while in the framing of dogmas it must admit\nmodifications from the complete circle of our knowledge, still brings\nits own contribution of immediate experience. (1926 [1996:\n79\u201380])\n\n\nOn the other hand, when religion shelters itself from the complete\ncircle of knowledge, it also faces \u201cdecay\u201d and, Whitehead\nadds, \u201cthe Church will perish unless it opens its window\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 146]). So there really is no alternative. But that\ndoes not render the task at hand any easier.\n\nWhitehead lists two necessary, but not sufficient, requirements for\nreligious leaders to reshape, again and again, the outer expressions\nof their inner experiences: First, they should stop exaggerating the\nimportance of the outer life of religion. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nCollective enthusiasms, revivals, institutions, churches, rituals,\nbibles, codes of behavior, are the trappings of religion, its passing\nforms. They may be useful, or harmful; they may be authoritatively\nordained, or merely temporary expedients. But the end of religion is\nbeyond all this. (1926 [1996: 17])\n\n\nSecondly, they should learn from scientists how to deal with continual\nrevision. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nWhen Darwin or Einstein proclaim theories which modify our ideas, it\nis a triumph for science. We do not go about saying that there is\nanother defeat for science, because its old ideas have been abandoned.\nWe know that another step of scientific insight has been gained.\n\nReligion will not regain its old power until it can face change in the\nsame spirit as does science. Its principles may be eternal, but the\nexpression of those principles requires continual development. This\nevolution of religion is in the main a disengagement of its own proper\nideas in terms of the imaginative picture of the world entertained in\nprevious ages. Such a release from the bonds of imperfect science is\nall to the good. (1925 [1967: 188\u2013189])\n\n\nIn this respect, Whitehead offers the following example:\n\n\nThe clash between religion and science, which has relegated the earth\nto the position of a second-rate planet attached to a second-rate sun,\nhas been greatly to the benefit of the spirituality of religion by\ndispersing [a number of] medieval fancies. (1925 [1967: 190])\n\n\nOn the other hand, Whitehead is well aware that religion more often\nfails than succeeds in this respect, and he writes, for example, that\nboth\n\n\nChristianity and Buddhism \u2026 have suffered from the rise of\n\u2026 science, because neither of them had \u2026 the requisite\nflexibility of adaptation. (1926 [1996: 146])\n\n\nIf the condition of mutual tolerance is satisfied, then, according to\nWhitehead: \u201cA clash of doctrines is not a disaster\u2014it is\nan opportunity\u201d (1925 [1967: 186]). In other words, if this\ncondition is satisfied, then the clash between religion and science is\nan opportunity on the path toward their integration or, as Whitehead\nputs it:\n\n\nThe clash is a sign that there are wider truths and finer perspectives\nwithin which a reconciliation of a deeper religion and a more subtle\nscience will be found. (1925 [1967: 185])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the task of philosophy is \u201cto absorb\ninto one system all sources of experience\u201d (1926 [1996:\n149]), including the intuitions at the basis of both science and\nreligion, and in Religion in the Making, he expresses the\nbasic religious intuition as follows:\n\n\nThere is a quality of life which lies always beyond the mere fact of\nlife; and when we include the quality in the fact, there is still\nomitted the quality of the quality. It is not true that the finer\nquality is the direct associate of obvious happiness or obvious\npleasure. Religion is the direct apprehension that, beyond such\nhappiness and such pleasure remains the function of what is actual and\npassing, that it contributes its quality as an immortal fact to the\norder which informs the world. (1926 [1996: 80])\n\n\nThe first aspect of this dual intuition that \u201cour existence is\nmore than a succession of bare facts\u201d (idem) is that the quality\nor value of each of the successive occasions of life derives from a\nfiner quality or value, which lies beyond the mere facts of life, and\neven beyond obvious happiness and pleasure, namely, the finer quality\nor value of which life is informed by God. The second aspect is that\neach of the successive occasions of life contributes its quality or\nvalue as an immortal fact to God.\n\nIn Process and Reality, Whitehead absorbed this dual\nreligious intuition in terms of the bipolar\u2014primordial and\nconsequent\u2014nature of God.\n\nGod viewed as primordial does not determine the becoming of each\nactual occasion, but conditions it (cf. supra\u2014the initial\nsubjective aim). He does not force, but tenderly persuades each actual\noccasion to actualize\u2014from \u201cthe absolute wealth of\npotentiality\u201d (1929c [1985: 343)\u2014value-potentials relevant\nfor that particular becoming. \u201cGod\u201d, according to\nWhitehead, \u201cis the poet of the world, with tender patience\nleading it by his vision of truth, beauty, and goodness\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 346]).\n\n\u201cThe ultimate evil in the temporal world\u201d, Whitehead\nwrites,\n\n\nlies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a \u201cperpetual\nperishing.\u201d \u2026 In the temporal world, it is the empirical\nfact that process entails loss. (1929c [1985: 340])\n\n\nIn other words, from a merely factual point of view, \u201chuman life\nis a flash of occasional enjoyments lighting up a mass of pain and\nmisery, a bagatelle of transient experience\u201d (1925 [1967:\n192]). According to Whitehead, however, this is not the whole story.\nOn 8 April 1928, while preparing the Gifford Lectures that became\nProcess and Reality, Whitehead wrote to Rosalind Greene:\n\n\nI am working at my Giffords. The problem of problems which bothers me,\nis the real transitoriness of things\u2014and yet!!\u2014I am\nequally convinced that the great side of things is weaving something\nageless and immortal: something in which personalities retain the\nwonder of their radiance\u2014and the fluff sinks into utter\ntriviality. But I cannot express it at all\u2014no system of words\nseems up to the job. (Unpublished letter archived by the Whitehead\nResearch Project)\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s attempt to express it in Process and\nReality reads:\n\n\nThere is another side to the nature of God which cannot be omitted.\n\u2026 God, as well as being primordial, is also consequent \u2026\nGod is dipolar. (1929c [1985: 345])\n\nThe consequent nature of God is his judgment on the world. He saves\nthe world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life. It is the\njudgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved. (1929c\n[1985: 346])\n\nThe consequent nature of God is the fluent world become\n\u2018everlasting\u2019 \u2026 in God. (1929c [1985: 347])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s dual description of God as tender persuader\nand tender savior reveals his affinity with \u201cthe\nGalilean origin of Christianity\u201d (1929c [1985: 343]). Indeed,\nhis\n\n\ntheistic philosophy \u2026 does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or\nthe ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender\nelements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operate by love.\n(idem)\n\n\nOne of the major reasons why Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy is\npopular among theologians, and gave rise to process theology, is the\nfact that it helps to overcome the doctrine of an omnipotent God\ncreating everything out of nothing. This creatio ex nihilo\ndoctrine implies God\u2019s responsibility for everything that is\nevil, and also that God is the only ultimate reality. In other words,\nit prevents the reconciliation of divine love and human suffering as\nwell as the reconciliation of the various religious traditions, for\nexample, theistic Christianity and nontheistic Buddhism. In yet other\nwords, the creatio ex nihilo doctrine is a stumbling block\nfor theologians involved in theodicy or interreligious dialogue.\nContrary to it, Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy holds that there\nare three ultimate (but inseparable) aspects of total reality: God\n(the divine actual entity), the world (the universe of all finite\nactual occasions), and the creativity (the twofold power to exert\nefficient and final causation) that God and all finite actual\noccasions embody. The distinction between God and creativity (that God\nis not the only instance of creativity) implies that there is no God\nwith the power completely to determine the becoming of all actual\noccasions in the world\u2014they are instances of creativity too. In\nthis sense, God is not omnipotent, but can be conceived as \u201cthe\nfellow-sufferer who understands\u201d (1929c [1985: 351]). Moreover,\nthe Whiteheadian doctrine of three ultimates\u2014the one supreme\nbeing or God, the many finite beings or the cosmos, and being itself\nor creativity\u2014also implies a religious pluralism that holds that\nthe different kinds of religious experience are (not experiences of\nthe same ultimate reality, but) diverse modes of experiencing diverse\nultimate aspects of the totality of reality. For example:\n\n\nOne of these [three ultimates], corresponding with what Whitehead\ncalls \u201ccreativity\u201d, has been called\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d (\u201cSunyata\u201d) or\n\u201cDharmakaya\u201d by Buddhists, \u201cNirguna Brahman\u201d\nby Advaita Vedantists, \u201cthe Godhead\u201d by Meister Eckhart,\nand \u201cBeing Itself\u201d by Heidegger and Tillich (among\nothers). It is the formless ultimate reality. The other\nultimate, corresponding with what Whitehead calls \u201cGod\u201d,\nis not Being Itself but the Supreme Being. It is in-formed\nand the source of forms (such as truth, beauty, and justice). It has\nbeen called \u201cAmida Buddha\u201d, \u201cSambhogakaya\u201d,\n\u201cSaguna Brahman\u201d, \u201cIshvara\u201d,\n\u201cYaweh\u201d, \u201cChrist\u201d, and \u201cAllah\u201d.\n(D. Griffin 2005: 47)\n\n[Some] forms of Taoism and many primal religions, including Native\nAmerican religions [\u2026] regard the cosmos as sacred. By\nrecognizing the cosmos as a third ultimate, we are able to see that\nthese cosmic religions are also oriented toward something truly\nultimate in the nature of things. (D. Griffin 2005: 49)\n\n\nThe religious pluralism implication of Whitehead\u2019s doctrine of\nthree ultimates has been drawn most clearly by John Cobb. In\n\u201cJohn Cobb\u2019s Whiteheadian Complementary Pluralism\u201d,\nDavid Griffin writes:\n\n\nCobb\u2019s view that the totality of reality contains three\nultimates, along with the recognition that a particular tradition\ncould concentrate on one, two, or even all three of them, gives us a\nbasis for understanding a wide variety of religious experiences as\ngenuine responses to something that is really there to be experienced.\n\u201cWhen we understand global religious experience and thought in\nthis way\u201d, Cobb emphasizes, \u201cit is easier to view the\ncontributions of diverse traditions as complementary\u201d. (D.\nGriffin 2005: 51)\n\n8. Whitehead\u2019s Influence\n\nWhitehead\u2019s key philosophical concept\u2014the internal\nrelatedness of occasions of experience\u2014distanced him from the\nidols of logical positivism. Indeed, his reliance on our intuition of\nthe extensive relatedness of events (and hence, of the space-time\nmetric) was at variance with both Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nconventionalism and Einstein\u2019s interpretation of relativity: his\nreliance on our intuition of the causal relatedness of events, and of\nboth the efficient and the final aspects of causation, was an insult\nto the anti-metaphysical dogmas of Hume and Russell; his method of\ncausal explanation was also an antipode of Ernst Mach\u2019s method\nof economic description; his philosophical affinity with James and\nBergson as well as his endeavor to harmonize science and religion made\nhim liable to the Russellian charge of anti-intellectualism; and his\ngenuine modesty and aversion to public controversy made him invisible\nat the philosophical firmament dominated by the brilliance of Ludwig\nWittgenstein.\n\nAt first\u2014because of Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica collaboration with Russell as well as his application\nof mathematical logic to abstract the basic concepts of\nphysics\u2014logical positivists and analytic philosophers admired\nWhitehead. But when Whitehead published Science and the Modern\nWorld, the difference between Whitehead\u2019s thought and\ntheirs became obvious, and they grew progressively more dissatisfied\nover the direction in which Whitehead was moving. Susan Stebbing of\nthe Cambridge school of analysis is only one of many examples that\ncould be evoked here (cf. Chapman 2013: 43\u201349), and in order to\nfind a more positive reception of Whitehead\u2019s philosophical\nwork, one has to turn to opponents of analytic philosophy such as\nRobin George Collingwood (for example, Collingwood 1945). The\ndifferences with logical positivism and analytic philosophy, however,\nshould not lead philosophers to neglect the affinities of\nWhitehead\u2019s thought with these philosophical currents (cf.\nShields 2003, Desmet & Weber 2010, Desmet & Rusu 2012, Riffert\n2012).\n\nDespite signs of interest in Whitehead by a number of famous\nphilosophers\u2014for example, Hannah Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty\nand Gilles Deleuze\u2014it is fair to say that Whitehead\u2019s\nprocess philosophy would most likely have entered oblivion if the\nChicago Divinity School and the Claremont School of Theology had not\nshown a major interest in it. In other words, not philosophers but\ntheologians saved Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy from oblivion.\nFor example, Charles Hartshorne, who taught at the University of\nChicago from 1928 to 1955, where he was a dominant intellectual force\nin the Divinity School, has been instrumental in highlighting the\nimportance of Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy, which dovetailed\nwith his own, largely independently developed thought. Hartshorne\nwrote:\n\n\nThe century which produced some terrible things produced a scientist\nscarcely second in genius and character to any that ever lived,\nEinstein, and a philosopher who, I incline to say, is similarly second\nto none, unless it be Plato. To make no use of genius of this order is\nhardly wise; for it is indeed a rarity. A mathematician sensitive to\nso many of the values in our culture, so imaginative and inventive in\nhis thinking, so eager to learn from the great minds of the past and\nthe present, so free from any narrow partisanship, religious or\nirreligious, is one person in hundreds of millions. He can be\nmistaken, but even his mistakes may be more instructive than most\nother writers\u2019 truth. (2010: 30)\n\n\nAfter mentioning a number of other theologians next to Hartshorne as\npart of \u201cthe first wave of \u2026 impressive\nWhitehead-inspired scholars\u201d, Michel Weber\u2014in his\nIntroduction to the two-volume Handbook of Whiteheadian Process\nThought\u2014writes:\n\n\nIn the sixties emerged John B. Cobb, Jr. and Shubert M. Ogden.\nCobb\u2019s Christian Natural Theology remains a landmark in\nthe field. The journal Process Studies was created in 1971 by\nCobb and Lewis S. Ford; the Center for Process Studies was\nestablished in 1973 by Cobb and David Ray Griffin in Claremont. The\nresult of these developments was that Whiteheadian process scholarship\nhas acquired, and kept, a fair visibility \u2026 (Weber &\nDesmond 2008: 25)\n\n\nIndeed, inspired mainly by Cobb and Griffin, many other centers,\nsocieties, associations, projects and conferences of Whiteheadian\nprocess scholarship have seen the light of day all over the world. An\nimportant society is the European Society for Process\nThought with its annual summer schools and its book series,\nEuropean Studies in Process Thought (nine titles).\nAnother active society is the Deutsche Whitehead\nGesellschaft. Thirty six of today\u2019s most active\nprocess centers, however, are located in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. They were founded between 2002 and\n2018 by The Institute for Postmodern Development of\nChina, which also founded the Cobb\nEco-Academy in 2018, in Zhejiang. The Beijing\nWhitehead International Kindergarten is just\none example of Chinese involvement with Whitehead.\n\nOut of Belgium, Michel Weber has created in 2001 the\nWhitehead Psychology Nexus and the Chromatiques\nwhiteheadiennes scholarly societies, and he has been the driving\nforce behind several book series, including the\nseries published by Weber\u2019s own publishing company, Les\n\u00e9ditions Chromatika (forty four titles at\npresent), and the Process Thought Series published by\nOntos Verlag / De Gruyter (twenty seven\ntitles). The already mentioned Handbook of Whiteheadian\nProcess Thought is part of the latter book series. In\nit, 101 internationally renowned Whitehead scholars give an\nimpressive overview of the 2008 status of their research findings in\nan enormous variety of domains (cf. Armour 2010). Missing in the\nHandbook, however, are most Whitehead scholars reading\nWhitehead through Deleuzian glasses\u2014especially Isabelle\nStengers, whose 2011 book, Thinking with Whitehead, cannot be\nignored. The Lure of Whitehead, edited by Nicholas Gaskill\nand A. J. Nocek in 2014, can largely remedy that shortcoming.\nImportant for Whitehead scholarship, is the fact that the\nHandbook is in the process of being transformed into an\nonline Whitehead encyclopedia, which will contain additional entries,\nand of which the entries will be kept up to date. This is being\ndone by the Whitehead Research Project, that is, by the\npeople responsible for editing and publishing the book\nseries, Contemporary Whitehead Studies (fifteen\ntitles), and The Edinburgh Critical Edition of the\nComplete Works of Alfred North Whitehead, of which two volumes of\nThe Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead have already\nseen the light of day. The Whitehead Research Project website\nalso refers to a Whitehead Reading Group, contains\na Research Blog, and provides access to the Whitehead\nResearch Library, which holds a wealth of\nmostly unpublished materials, such as letters from and to\nWhitehead (cf. Whitehead Research Project\n [OIR]).\n\nThe oldest Whiteheadian book series is the SUNY Series\nin Constructive Postmodern Thought (thirty two titles), and\nthe two most recent series are published by the Process Century\nPress (cf. Process Century Press\n [OIR]).\n The most recent title in its Theological Exploration\nSeries (nine titles) is James & Whitehead on\nLife after Death by David Griffin (2022), and in the Series\nPreface of its successful Toward Ecological Civilization\nSeries (twenty two titles), John Cobb writes:\n\n\nWe live in the ending of an age. But the ending of the modern period\ndiffers from the ending of previous periods, such as the classical or\nthe medieval. The amazing achievements of modernity make it possible,\neven likely, that its end will also be the end of civilization, of\nmany species, or even of the human species. At the same time, we are\nliving in an age of new beginnings that give promise of an ecological\ncivilization. Its emergence is marked by a growing sense of urgency\nand deepening awareness that the changes must go to the roots of what\nhas led to the current threat of catastrophe.\n\nIn June 2015, the 10th Whitehead International Conference was held in\nClaremont, CA. Called \u201cSeizing an Alternative: Toward an\nEcological Civilization\u201d, it claimed an organic, relational,\nintegrated, nondual, and processive conceptuality is needed, and that\nAlfred North Whitehead provides this in a remarkably comprehensive and\nrigorous way. We proposed that he could be \u201cthe philosopher of\necological civilization\u201d. With the help of those who have come\nto an ecological vision in other ways, the conference explored this\nWhiteheadian alternative, showing how it can provide the shared vision\nso urgently needed.\n\n\nCobb refers to the tenth International Whitehead\nConference (IWC). The IWCs are sponsored by\nthe International Process Network. The IWC has\nbeen held at locations around the globe since 1981\u2014the 12th one\nwas in 2019, in Brasilia, Brazil, and the 13th one,\n\u201cWhitehead and the History of Philosophy,\u201d will be in July\n2023, in Munich, Germany. The IWC is an\nimportant venture in global Whiteheadian thought, as key Whiteheadian\nscholars from a variety of disciplines and countries come together for\nthe continued pursuit of critically engaging a process worldview.\nFinally, in 2019, the Cobb Institute\u2014A Community for\nProcess & Practice was formed, which has, among other\ninteresting initiatives, weekly John Cobb &\nFriends online gatherings to hear presentations from\nprominent scholars across the world. Recently, for\nexample, Jeremy Lent gave a presentation on his award\nwinning bestseller, The Web of Meaning\u2014Integrating science and\ntraditional wisdom to find our place in the universe (2021). The\nCobb & Friends Gatherings YouTube Channel contains a\nsample of recordings of these presentations, among which the Lent\npresentation.\n",
