    "main_text": "Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test\n4. Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test\n\nGiven the initial distinction that we made between different ways in\nwhich the expression The Turing Test gets interpreted in the\nliterature, it is probably best to approach the question of the\nassessment of the current standing of The Turing Test by dividing\ncases. True enough, we think that there is a correct interpretation of\nexactly what test it is that is proposed by Turing (1950); but a\ncomplete discussion of the current standing of The Turing Test should\npay at least some attention to the current standing of other tests\nthat have been mistakenly supposed to be proposed by Turing\n(1950).\n\nThere are a number of main ideas to be investigated. First, there is\nthe suggestion that The Turing Test provides logically necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the attribution of intelligence. Second,\nthere is the suggestion that The Turing Test provides logically\nsufficient\u2014but not logically necessary\u2014conditions for the\nattribution of intelligence. Third, there is the suggestion that The\nTuring Test provides \u201ccriteria\u201d\u2014defeasible\nsufficient conditions\u2014for the attribution of intelligence.\nFourth\u2014and perhaps not importantly distinct from the previous\nclaim\u2014there is the suggestion that The Turing Test provides\n(more or less strong) probabilistic support for the attribution of\nintelligence. We shall consider each of these suggestions in turn.\n",
