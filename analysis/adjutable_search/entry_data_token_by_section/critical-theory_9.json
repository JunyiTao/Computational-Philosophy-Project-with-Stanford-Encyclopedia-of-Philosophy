That break concerns\nnot only their \u201cpessimism,\u201d but the basic methodological\nand substantial premises of their theories. In Habermas\u2019s view,\nthe first generation had navigated themselves into a dead end with\ntheir totalizing diagnosis of an all-encompassing state of delusion\ndominated by instrumental rationality. In response, and in order to\nprovide firm normative foundations for critical theory, Habermas\nadvocates a \u201ccommunicative turn,\u201d reformulating social\ncritique in terms of a critique of the conditions of communication and\ngrounding it in the normative content presupposed within the practice\nof linguistically mediated social interaction and argumentation.\n\nThis element of normative validity \u2013 as opposed to merely\nfactual social validity that is forced, imposed, or presupposed\n\u2013 is elaborated in Habermas\u2019s discourse theory, originally\nreferred to as \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d (Habermas 1983a, Ch. 4)\nbut later evolving into a differentiated approach that distinguishes\nbetween ethical and moral norms (Habermas 1991) and a discourse theory\nof law and democracy (Habermas 1992). At the heart of discourse theory\nis a principle of discursive justification that Habermas refers to as\nthe \u201cdiscourse principle\u201d or \u201cD,\u201d which\nstates: \u201cjust those norms of action are valid if all persons\naffected could agree as participants in rational discourse\u201d\n(Habermas 1992 [1996, 107]). He further specifies discourse theory\nwith a universalization principle (\u201cU\u201d) that is operative\nwhen arguing about moral norms, and a democratic principle that is\noperative when attempting to justify legal norms within a democratic\nsociety. Habermas does not naively suggest that actually existing\ndiscourses correspond to these ideals, but maintains that in those\ndiscourses participants necessarily make idealizing presuppositions\nthat can then be used to identify and criticize the shortcomings of\nactual discourse as distorted by interests, power relations, and\nideologies.\n\nAs a response to the challenges of immanent critique outlined above,\nHabermas\u2019s work can be understood in terms of a\n\u201cdialectics of immanence and transcendence\u201d (Cooke 2006,\nCh. 3). Habermas maintains the need to situate reason historically and\nwithin social reality \u2013 the largely Hegelian, pragmatist, or\nreconstructive element of his thought. But the idealizations that are\nimmanent in our linguistic practices point toward context-transcending\nvalidity claims that must be defended in a discursive procedure\n\u2013 the Kantian or constructivist element in his thought. Habermas\nnow refers to his attempt to \u201cde-transcendentalize Kant\u201d\nas a form of \u201cKantian pragmatism\u201d (Habermas 1999; see also\nBernstein 2010, Ch. 8; Baynes 2016, Ch. 4; Flynn 2014b).\n\nSome interpretations of Habermas stress that his theory of\ncommunicative action is still a form of immanent critique (Finlayson\n2007, Stahl 2013b) while others object to his increasingly Kantian\nfocus on moral norms (Heath 2014). To provide empirical confirmation\nof his rational reconstruction of the \u201cmoral point of\nview,\u201d further situating it within social reality, Habermas drew\non Kohlberg\u2019s developmental moral psychology, itself decidedly\nKantian in its defining the highest stage of moral development in\nterms of the ability to make universalizable moral judgements\n(Habermas 1983a, Ch. 4; for a critique, see Benhabib 1992, Chs.\n5\u20136, which, drawing on Carol Gilligan\u2019s critique of\nKohlberg, distinguishes a \u201cgeneralized other\u201d from a\n\u201cconcrete other\u201d whose experience cannot be accounted for\nby abstract conceptions of the moral standpoint).\n\nHabermas\u2019s shift toward a Kantian position is particularly\nevident in the Rawls-Habermas debate (Habermas 1995a, Rawls 1995,\nHabermas 1996), widely viewed as a \u201cfamily quarrel\u201d among\ntwo Kantian political philosophers. In his early work on discourse\nethics, Habermas compared his own principle (U) to Rawls\u2019s\n\u201coriginal position,\u201d arguing that his approach was the\nbetter way to \u201coperationalize\u201d the moral point of view as\na form of moral constructivism that tests moral norms in a discursive\nprocedure posited as a dialogical alternative to Kant\u2019s\ncategorical imperative (Habermas 1991). The debate shifted in the\n1990s with their contributions to legal-political constructivism:\nRawls\u2019s Political Liberalism (1993) and\nHabermas\u2019s Between Facts and Norms (1992), in which he\nprovides a rational reconstruction of the institutions of\nconstitutional democracy. In that context, Habermas argues that\nRawls\u2019s approach is not transcendent enough, since in\nHabermas\u2019s view Rawls reduces normative validity to the notion\nof reasonableness immanent within liberal democratic societies (for\nthe implications of their debate for multiple issues in moral and\npolitical philosophy, see Hedrick 2010, Baynes 2016, Chs. 6\u20137,\nand Finlayson 2019).\n\nHabermas\u2019s Kantian turn also came to the fore when extending his\nwork in a cosmopolitan or \u201cpost-national\u201d direction\n(beginning with Habermas 1995b), even if he has continued to combine a\nKantian approach to justifying universal norms with a wide-ranging\nanalysis of the empirical phenomena of globalization (1998). This\ncombination of normative and empirical theorizing, a hallmark of the\nFrankfurt School, is present in a range of work by other critical\ntheorists addressing global issues (Ingram 2019, Ibsen 2023), from the\nchallenge of disaggregating citizenship from the nation-state\n(Benhabib 2004) to transnationalizing the public sphere (Fraser et al.\n2014), and theorizing new forms of transnational democracy (Bohman\n2007). Rather than simply defending abstract cosmopolitan norms, such\napproaches typically aim at some form of critical cosmopolitanism\n(Milstein 2015), with some stressing the crucial role of political\ncontestation of allegedly universal norms \u201cfrom below\u201d (J.\nIngram 2013) or of concrete struggles for rights as part of a broadly\nconstrued intercultural dialogue on human rights (Flynn 2014a).\n\nIn light of Habermas\u2019s turn to Kant, a significant focus of\ndebate among Habermasians and interpreters of Habermas has been the\nstatus of idealizing presuppositions and the ultimate status of the\nprinciples of justification within discourse theory. Defenders of\ndiscourse theory can be divided up into those who focus more on\nimmanence \u2013 pointing in a Hegelian, pragmatist, contextualist,\nor reconstructive direction \u2013 and those who focus more on\ntranscendence \u2013 pointing in a Kantian or constructivist\ndirection. Among the former, some argue, echoing Hegel\u2019s\ncritique of Kant, that Habermas should situate reason more thoroughly\nwithin its social and historical context in order to avoid an overly\nrationalistic, abstract, or gendered approach (Benhabib 1986, 1992),\nwhile others have argued for Habermas to embrace a more pragmatist\n(McCarthy 1991, Bernstein 2010) or contextualist approach (Rorty 1985,\nAllen 2008, Ch. 6). Habermas\u2019s most recent work (2019) attempts\na kind of middle path, going in a decidedly historical direction by\ntracing the provincial, European origins of his\n\u201cpost-metaphysical\u201d mode of theorizing as a preparatory\nstage to a fully inclusive, global intercultural dialogue as the way\nto establish its universal validity in a world characterized by\n\u201cmultiple modernities\u201d (see Forst 2021b, Chambers 2022,\nand Flynn 2022 for critical assessments).\n\nThose who have taken discourse theory in a more Kantian or\ntranscendental direction include Habermas\u2019s long-time\ninterlocutor Karl Otto-Apel, who argued that the dynamic of universal\nvalidity claims in practices of argumentation transcendentally\npresupposes an ideal communication community from which universal\nnormative foundations for the assessment of discourses can be derived\n(Apel 1985). Apel maintained that grounding reason, and thereby\ncritique, requires a more transcendental justification (or\n\u201cultimate grounding\u201d) than Habermas has provided (Apel\n1989; see Habermas\u2019s most recent reply to Apel in 2005, Ch.\n3).\n\nMore recently, Rainer Forst has embraced Kantian constructivism in\npositing that every human being has a \u201cright to\njustification,\u201d a right to demand reciprocal and general reasons\nfor the practices, institutions, and structures that affect them\n(Forst 2007). Forst views moral and political constructivism as\ndistinct, but integrated stages. While the task of moral\nconstructivism is to construct a list of basic moral rights that\ncannot be reasonably rejected, those abstract rights must be given\nconcrete content by citizens in a process of political constructivism.\nHe maintains that his approach is immanent insofar as the right to\njustification is \u201crecursively grounded\u201d by reconstructing\nthe validity claims implicit in all morally justified claims, while\nmaintaining a moment of transcendence since the right to justification\ncan be justifiably claimed in any context. Forst views this as the\nnormative core of a critical theory that understands society as an\nensemble of practices of justification. In that sense, the concept of\njustification is both descriptive (referring to actual arguments given\nwithin a particular social order) and normative (referring to reasons\nthat could or should be accepted), and Forst maintains both\nperspectives are needed for a critique of existing justification\nnarratives and relations of justification (see the Introductions to\nForst 2011 and 2021a).\n\nVarious critics of Habermas have argued that his normative turn and\nshift to Kant risks transforming critical theory into something that\nlooks increasingly like a liberal theory of justice. They posit\nalternative approaches such as reconstructive, disclosive, and\ngenealogical critique that also return to questions and arguments\ndeveloped by the first generation.\n",
