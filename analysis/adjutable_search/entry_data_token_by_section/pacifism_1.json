    "main_text": "Defining Peace || Peace as Slavery or Submission\n1.1 Peace as Slavery or Submission\n\nPeace can result from submission to power; and war can end with\nunconditional surrender. Rousseau maligned this sort of peace by\ncalling it the \u201cpeace of Ulysses and his comrades, imprisoned in\nthe cave of the Cyclops and waiting their turn to be devoured\u201d\n(Rousseau 1917, 125). We might claim that absolute rule and absolute\nsubmission produce a sort of peace. But this is peace conjoined with\ninjustice. So it is clear that the sort of peace that is worth\npursuing is peace that is also linked to justice. The idea of justice\nis at the heart of the just war tradition, which claims that we are\nentitled to fight back against injustice. As Patrick Henry asked in\nhis famous \u201cGive me Liberty or Give me Death Speech\u201d:\n\u201cIs life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the\nprice of chains and slavery?\u201d One might claim that the peace of\nthe Cyclops\u2019 cave is not peace at all but a state of war.\n\nMost pacifists will claim that the false peace of slavery is not what\nthey have in mind. Rather, for the majority of pacifists, pacifism is\nnot simply acquiescing passively to evil\u2014pacifism is not\npassive-ism. Rather, pacifism involves actively but nonviolently\nresisting evil. Nonetheless, some pacifists, such as Tolstoy, do\nappear to advocate nonresistance. Tolstoy said, for example,\n\u201cthe only means of deliverance from violence is the submissive\nand peaceful endurance of it\u201d (Tolstoy 1906, 36; see\nChristoyannopoulos 2020). Nonresistant pacifists in the Christian\ntradition often base the idea of submitting to evil on Jesus\u2019\nideas as expressed in the Sermon on the Mount. \u201cDo not resist\none who is evil\u201d and \u201clove your enemies and pray for those\nwho persecute you\u201d (Matthew 5.39 and 5.44; Luke 6.27\u201330).\nSome Christian martyrs take this ideal seriously and look to\nJesus\u2019 life and execution as a model of pacific virtue.\n",
