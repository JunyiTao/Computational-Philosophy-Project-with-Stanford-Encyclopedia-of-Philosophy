    "main_text": "Arguments for and against the Principle\n3. Arguments for and against the Principle\n\n\n(i) The Principle appeals to empiricists. For how could we ever have\nempirical evidence for two indiscernible items? If we did, empiricists\nmight say, then they would have to be differently related to us.\nUnless we ourselves have exact replicas, which is implausible, we are\nthe unique beings with pure\nproperties X, Y, Z etc. Hence the\nempirically distinguishable objects have different pure properties,\nnamely, being related in different ways to the unique things\nwith X, Y, Z, etc. From this and the\nempiricist premiss that there are no things which are not empirically\ndistinguishable, we would conclude that the Weak Principle\nholds. Presumably the premiss would not be proposed as anything more\nthan contingently true. For there are possible situations in which\nthere would be theoretical reasons for believing in indiscernible\nitems as a consequence of a theory which best explains the empirical\ndata. Thus we might come to hold a theory of the origins of the\nphysical universe which had large amounts of empirical support, and\nwhich implied that, in addition to our enormously complicated\nuniverse, various simpler ones had been generated. For some of the\nsimplest universes this theory might imply that there were exact\nreplicas. In that case the Weak Principle would fail. \n\n\n(ii) If we ignore quantum mechanics, we might well conclude that not\nmerely the Weak Principle is contingently correct but even the Strong\nPrinciple. For unless we take space to be discrete, the classical\nmechanical situation would seem to be summed up by the Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrence theorem which tells us that typically we get arbitrarily\nclose to an exact repetition, but never get to one. (See Earman 1986,\np. 130.)\n\n\n(iii) Concerning the Weak Principle there has been an interesting\ndevelopment of a line of argument due to Black (1952) and Ayer (1954)\nin which it is proposed that there could be exact symmetry in the\nuniverse. In Black\u2019s example it is suggested that there could be a\nuniverse containing nothing but two exactly resembling spheres. In\nsuch a completely symmetrical universe the two spheres would be\nindiscernible. Against this has been noted, e.g., Hacking (1975), that\nsuch a completely symmetrical situation of two spheres could be\nre-interpreted as one sphere in a non-Euclidean space. So what might\nbe described as a journey from one sphere to a qualitatively identical\none 2 units apart could be redescribed as a journey around space back\nto the very same sphere. Quite generally it might be said that we may\nalways redescribe apparent counter-examples to the Weak Principle so\nthat qualitatively identical objects symmetrically situated are\ninterpreted as the very same object. This Identity Defence, as Hawley\n(2009) calls it, is vulnerable to a version Adam\u2019s continuity\nargument. (1979)\n\n\nA rejoinder to this is the continuity argument, essentially due to\nAdams (1979). It is granted that almost perfect symmetry is possible.\nFor there could be a space with nothing in it but a sequence of\nspheres arranged in a line at equal distance without any intrinsic\ndifference except that one of them is scratched. The identity defence\nis then committed to the counter-intuitive counterfactual \u201cIf\nthere had been no scratch on a sphere the shape of space would have\nbeen different\u201d. \n\n\nIn addition to this rejoinder, it should be noted that in only\nslightly more complicated examples the identification strategy is\nrather less persuasive than in the two sphere case. Consider the\nexample of three qualitatively identical spheres arranged in a line,\nwith the two outside ones the same distance from the middle one. The\nidentification strategy would first require the two outer ones to be\nidentified. But in that case there remain two qualitatively identical\nspheres, so these must in turn be identified. The upshot is that it is\nnot merely the two spheres we took to be indistinguishable that are\nsaid to be identical but all three, including the middle one which\nseemed clearly distinguished from the other two by means of a pure\nrelational property.\nAdams may be interpreted as providing two arguments, the first\nbeing the continuity argument used above. The second is a modal\nargument relying on the Necessity of Identity and a suitably strong\nmodal logic. Suppose there are two objects that are distinguished by\naccidental features, as it might be one of the spheres, A has\na scratch, while the other B does not. Then it is possible\nthat A has no scratch and hence possible that the spheres be\nindiscernible. If the Principle holds of necessity then that entails\nthat it is possible that A = B. But by the Necessity\nof Identity that in turn entails that it is possibly necessary\nthat A = B, so in S5 modal logic (or the\nweaker system B), it follows that A = B,\nwhich is absurd given that one has a scratch and the other does\nnot. In this argument any accidental difference would suffice in place\nof the scratch.\nIgnoring quantum mechanics we have, then, arguments that many find\npersuasive to show that both the Weak and the Strong Principle are\ncontingently true but neither are necessarily so. For the relevance of\nquantum mechanics, see French 2019.\n3.1 Recent Developments\nO\u2019Leary Hawthorne (1995) redescribes Black\u2019s example as\na single sphere with two locations. If we accept either of\nAdams\u2019 argument it follows that discernible spheres can be\nredescribed as a single sphere with two locations but with\nincompatible properties in the locations, which is seriously\ncounter-intuitive if not absurd (Hawley 2009 \u2014 see also her\nfurther criticisms.)\nAnother ingenious idea, suggested by Hawley, is that the two\nspheres be redescribed as a simple extended object, contrary to the\nintuition that a simple extended object must have a connected location\n(Markosian 1998). Once again, Adam\u2019s argument then implies that this\nredescription holds even of discernible objects of the same kind,\nthreatening us with the somewhat counter-intuitive monist thesis that\nthe universe is just one simple object. (For discussions of this\nlatter thesis, see Potrc and Horgan 2008 and Schaffer 2008,\n\u00a72.1.)\n3.2 Identical Collocated Spheres?\nDella Rocca invites us to consider the hypothesis that where we\nordinarily think there is a single sphere in fact there are many\nidentical collocated spheres, made up of precisely the same parts. (If\nthey were not made up of the same parts then the mass of the twenty\nspheres would be twenty times that of one sphere, resulting in an\nempirical difference between the twenty sphere hypothesis and the one\nsphere hypothesis.)  Intuitively this is absurd, and it is contrary to\nthe Principle, but he challenges those who reject the Principle to\nexplain why they reject the hypothesis. If they cannot, then this\nprovides a case for the Principle. He considers the response that the\nPrinciple should be accepted only in the following qualified form:\n There cannot be two or more indiscernible things with all\nthe same parts in precisely the same place at the same time (2005, 488)\n\nHe argues that this concedes the need to explain non-identity, in\nwhich case the Principle itself is required in the case of simple\nthings. Against Della Rocca, it may then be argued that for simples\n(things without parts) non-identity is a brute fact.  This is in\naccord with the plausible weakening of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason that restricts brute facts, even necessary ones, to the basic\nthings that depend on nothing further. \n3.3 The Third Grade Principle\nSuppose we grant the possibility of otherwise indiscernible objects\nthat are asymmetrically related. Then we have not just a\ncounterexample to the weak Principle, but an interesting further\nweakening to the Third Grade Principle, namely that in cases where the\nWeak Principle fails the otherwise indiscernible objects stand in a\nsymmetric but irreflexive relation \u2014 \u201cThird Grade\u201d\nbecause based on Quine\u2019s third grade of discrimination (1976). Recently\nSaunders has investigated this, noting that fermions but not bosons\nare third grade discriminable (2006).\nBlack\u2019s spheres are third grade discriminable because they stand in\nthe symmetric relation of being at least two miles apart, but this\nexample illustrates the objection that third grade discriminability\npresupposes non-identity (see French 2006).  For suppose we identify\nthe two spheres, treating space as cylindrical, then the geodesic\njoining the sphere would still be a geodesic and remain the same\nlength. So we could quite naturally say the sphere was at least two\nmiles from itself, unless we analyse that relation negatively as there\nbeing no path joining the spheres of less than two miles. But that\nnegative relation only holds in the Black case because the spheres are\nnot identified.\n",
