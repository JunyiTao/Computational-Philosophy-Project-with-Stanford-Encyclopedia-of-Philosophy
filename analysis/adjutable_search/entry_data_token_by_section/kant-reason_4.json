    "main_text": "Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations || Reason\u2019s self-knowledge\n1.4 Reason\u2019s self-knowledge\n\nThe first Critique argues that there has, so far, been no\nreal progress in metaphysics. In the second edition Preface, Kant\nproudly proclaims that his book has finally put metaphysics on\n\u201cthe sure path of a science\u201d (Bvii; cf. Axiii). So we\nmight ask: what is the relation of metaphysics\u2014or philosophical\nreasoning more generally\u2014to areas of human enquiry that generate\ncertainty (geometry and mathematics) and expand knowledge (science in\ngeneral)?\n\nKant insists that mathematics cannot provide a model for philosophy.\n\u201cMathematics gives the most resplendent example of pure reason\nhappily expanding itself without assistance from experience\u201d\n(A712/B740). But metaphysics cannot follow this\n course.[15]\n This is not simply a rhetorical point, since many of Kant\u2019s\npredecessors had tried to do exactly this\u2014Spinoza\u2019s\nEthics is one example, Christian Wolff\u2019s philosophy\nanother (see Gava 2018). Kant\u2019s basic argument is that\nmathematicians are justified in constructing objects or\naxioms a priori, because they can work with pure intuitions\u2014like\na line or the form of a triangle, for example\u2014rather than being\nrestricted only to the analysis of concepts. (See the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics.)\n Philosophers cannot follow this sort of procedure because they have\nno right to assume any a priori intuitions or axioms about\nmetaphysical entities. Attempts that rely on such claims have only\nproduced \u201cso many houses of cards\u201d (A727/B755).\n\nThe empirical sciences also offer an unpromising model for\nmetaphysics. In the first place, Kant has argued that experience\ncannot reveal metaphysical entities. We could never know, for\ninstance, that we are free: like everything else we can know, human\nconduct is open to causal explanation. Second, experience cannot\ngenerate the sort of necessity Kant associates with metaphysical\nconclusions. Experience reveals contingent facts: it cannot\nshow that such-and-such must be the case. (Kant\u2019s\nposition here is complicated, since he also holds that scientific laws\nhave the metaphysical quality of necessity. Genuine laws are\nuniversal, and not mere generalizations or rules of thumb.\nBut this metaphysical claim requires philosophical\njustification\u2014thus Kant\u2019s short book, Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786). It is not discovered by\ninvestigating the world.)\n\nNone\u00a0of these points, however, deters Kant from using the imagery\nof science and experiment to describe his own philosophical efforts.\nThese metaphors are especially prominent in the Preface to the second\nedition of the Critique, where he writes:\n\nReason, in order to be taught by nature, must approach nature with its\nprinciples in one hand, according to which the agreement among\nappearances can count as laws, and, in the other hand, the experiment\nthought out in accord with these principles\u2014in order to be\ninstructed by nature not like a pupil, who has recited to him whatever\nthe teacher wants to say, but like an appointed judge who compels\nwitnesses to answer the questions he puts to them. (Bxiii)\n\n\nIn other words, reason, as \u201c[self-]appointed judge,\u201d does\nnot sit by and merely observe whatever comes along. It actively\nproposes principled accounts of the phenomenon it\ninvestigates\u2014that is, law-like hypotheses. Then it\ndevises experiments to confirm or disprove these.\n\nKant sees grounds for optimism in this picture. The natural sciences\ninvestigate the infinite scope of the empirical world. In contrast,\nphilosophy only considers \u201cwhat reason brings forth entirely out\nof itself\u2026 as soon as [its] common principle has been\ndiscovered\u201d (Axx). The Transcendental Dialectic of the first\nCritique offers one application of this idea. Kant insists\nthat there are only three transcendental ideas\u2014the thinking\nsubject (or soul), the world as a whole (the universe, or the entirety\nof time and space), and a being of all beings (that is, God)\n(A334/B391). As such, metaphysics is prone to three fundamental\nmistakes, which spring \u201cfrom the nature of reason\u201d itself\n(A339/B397; for more detail, see\n Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics).\n Philosophers have made many efforts to reach these ultimate or\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d objects. But these efforts always fail and\nthey always involve the same basic mistakes.\n\nWhether or not Kant is correct in this, his own picture of\nphilosophical reasoning may seem puzzling. He suggests that reason\nmust conduct an experiment upon itself\u2014an idea that is\nhard to make sense of. In addition, although he talks about\nreason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle,\u201d he does not explain\nwhat this may be.\n\nKant\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d may be less puzzling if we\nconsider his hypothesis about everyday knowledge. He makes an analogy\nwith Copernicus\u2019s suggestion that the earth orbits the sun (Bxvi\nf). Only if we take account of the earth\u2019s motion can we\nunderstand what we see in the heavens: we need to appreciate how our\nown (relative, moving) standpoint affects our observations.\nKant\u2019s parallel hypothesis is that our experience depends on the\nstandpoint and capacities of the observer. Our knowledge is not like\nGod\u2019s (albeit more confused and limited), as rationalist\nphilosophers sometimes suggested. Human knowledge has a structure of\nits own, and its own limits too.\n\nThe first main sections of the Critique explain and defend\nKant\u2019s philosophical hypothesis. We must take account of our\nhuman standpoint in order to explain the \u201ca priori\nstructure\u201d of our experience\u2014for example, how it is\nunified in a single order of space and time. The hypothesis is\nsupported partly because the main alternative fails. The\nnon-Copernican or non-Kantian view assumes a \u201csingle\nstandpoint.\u201d It does not distinguish between everyday knowledge\nand metaphysical speculation \u201cbeyond the bounds of\nexperience\u201d (Bxix). This leads to all sorts of problems. For\nexample, we might suppose that immortal souls could interact with\nmaterial objects and mortal human beings. Kant satirized this view in\nhis earlier book, Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of\nMetaphysics (1766). His stated target was a religious visionary\ncalled Emanuel Swedenborg. But the subtitle reveals Kant\u2019s\nphilosophical point: metaphysicians have been dreaming, too. They have\nnot appreciated the structure and limitations of the human standpoint.\nSo their arguments have created \u201can unavoidable conflict of\nreason with itself\u201d (Bxviii n). The \u201cAntinomies\u201d\nmentioned above\n (\u00a71.3)\n explain the basic contradictions that result.\n\nEven if Kant\u2019s arguments succeed, this still leaves awkward\nquestions about philosophical reasoning. Kant is not just concerned\nwith our capacities for everyday knowledge. As the book\u2019s title\nsays, he means to \u201ccritique\u201d or examine reason. But\nreasoning is the only means we have to do this. Does it make sense to\nthink of reason as criticizing or justifying itself? Might it even\npoint to something distinctive about our capacity to reason, that it\ncan examine itself in this way?\n\n\u00a73\n below discusses the most thorough reply to these question in the\nliterature, by Onora O\u2019Neill. To anticipate briefly:\nKant\u2019s metaphors\u2014of reason\u2019s experiment upon itself,\nas well as legal metaphors about testimony and\n examination[16]\u2014point\n to a general problem: reason\u2019s self-knowledge (cf. Axi\nf).\n\nKant assumes that we have a capacity to reason and that \u201cto\nphilosophize [is] to exercise the talent of reason\u2026\u201d\n(A838/B866). But since metaphysical reasoning has often gone wrong, he\ncannot merely assert the supremacy of reason. As he exclaims in the\nsecond edition Preface:\n\nhow little cause have we to place trust in our reason if in one of the\nmost important parts of our desire for knowledge it does not merely\nforsake us but even entices us with delusions and in the end betrays\nus! (Bxv)\n\n\nKant\u2019s question, then, is how we might defend reason\nfrom various\n doubts[17]\n and how we might discipline reason without begging\nquestions\u2014for instance, by invoking claims that are themselves\nopen to doubt (cf. O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 1, 1992, 2004 & 2015).\nThis is the central task of critique (cf. Bxxxv):\nreason\u2019s examination of itself. This should establish\nreason\u2019s powers and limits. It should give an account of\nreason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle\u201d and its authority.\n",
