    "main_text": "Carmichael on Natural Law\n2. Carmichael on Natural Law\n\nGershom Carmichael (1672\u20131729) studied at Edinburgh University\n(1687\u20131691), taught at St Andrews University (1693\u20131694),\nand spent the rest of his life at Glasgow, first as a regent in arts\nand then as professor of moral philosophy. He was a main conduit into\nScotland of the European natural law tradition, a tradition of\nscientific investigation of human nature with a view to constructing\nan account of the principles that are morally binding on us. Among the\ngreat figures of that tradition were Hugo Grotius (1583\u20131645)\nand Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131694), thinkers whose writings played\na major role in moral philosophical activity in Scotland during the\nAge of Enlightenment.\n\nIn 1718, during the first stirrings of the Scottish Enlightenment,\nCarmichael published Supplements and Observations upon the two\nbooks of the distinguished Samuel Pufendorf\u2019s On the Duty of Man\nand Citizen. In 1724 he published a second edition containing\nextensive additional material. Carmichael affirms: \u201cwhen God\nprescribes something to us, He is simply signifying that he requires\nus to do such and such an action, and regards it, when offered with\nthat intention, as a sign of love and veneration towards him, while\nfailure to perform such actions, and, still worse, commission of the\ncontrary acts, he interprets as an indication of contempt or\nhatred\u201d (Carmichael, [NR], p. 46). Hence we owe God love and\nveneration, and on this basis Carmichael distinguishes between\nimmediate and mediate duties. Our immediate duty is formulated in the\nfirst precept of natural law, that God is to be worshipped. He seeks a\nsign of our love and veneration for him, and worship is the clearest\nmanifestation of these feelings.\n\nThe second precept, which identifies our mediate duties, is:\n\u201cEach man should promote, so far as it is in his power, the\ncommon good of the whole human race, and, so far as this allows, the\nprivate good of individuals\u201d ([NR], p. 48). This relates to our\n\u2018mediate\u2019 duties since we indirectly signify our love and\nveneration of God by treating his creatures well. On this basis,\nCarmichael deploys the distinction between self and others in two\nsubordinate precepts: \u201cEach man should take care to promote his\nown interest without harming others\u201d and \u201cSociability is\nto be cultivated and preserved by every man so far as in him\nlies.\u201d These precepts, concerning duties to God, to self and to\nothers, are the fundamental precepts of natural law, and though the\nprecept that God is to be worshipped is prior to and more evident than\nthe precept that one should live sociably with men, the requirement\nthat we cultivate sociability is a foundation of the well-lived\nlife.\n\nCarmichael therefore rejects an important aspect of Pufendorf\u2019s\ndoctrine on the cultivation of sociability, for the latter argues that\nthe demand \u201cthat every man must cultivate and preserve\nsociability so far as he can\u201d is that to which all our duties\nare subordinate. Yet for Carmichael the precept that we worship God is\nnot traceable back to the duty to cultivate sociability, and therefore\nthe requirement that we cultivate and preserve sociability cannot\nprecede the laws binding us to behave appropriately towards God.\n\nFor instance, God is central to the narrative concerning the duty to\ncultivate our mind, for performance of this duty requires that we\ncultivate in ourselves the conviction that God is creator and governor\nof the universe and of us. Carmichael criticises Pufendorf for paying\ntoo little attention to the subject of cultivation of the mind, and\nindicates some features that might profitably have been considered by\nPufendorf, for example the following.\n\nDue cultivation of the mind involves filling it with sound opinion\nregarding our duty, learning to judge well the objects which commonly\nstimulate our desires, and acquiring rational control of our passions.\nIt also involves our learning to act on the knowledge that, as regards\nour humanity, we are neither superior nor inferior to other people.\nFinally, a person with a well cultivated mind is aware of how little\nhe knows of what the future holds, and consequently is neither\narrogant at his present happy circumstances nor excessively anxious\nabout ills that might yet assail him.\n\nThe Stoic character of this text is evident, as is Carmichael\u2019s\ninjunction that we not be disturbed on account of evils which have\nbefallen us, or which might befall us, due to no fault of ours. The\ndeliberate infringement of the moral law is said however to be another\nmatter; it prompts a discomfort peculiarly hard to bear. In full\nconcord with the Stoic tendency here observed, we find him supporting,\nunder the heading \u2018duty to oneself\u2019, a Stoic view of\nanger. Though not expressing unconditional disapproval of anger, he\ndoes point out that it is difficult to keep an outburst of anger\nwithin just limits, and that such an outburst is problematic in\nrelation to natural law, for: \u201cit must be regarded as one of the\nthings which most of all makes human life unsocial, and has pernicious\neffects for the human race. Thus we can scarcely be too diligent in\nrestraining our anger\u201d ([NR], p. 65). Anger conflicts with\nsociability and it is only by due cultivation of the mind that our\nsociability can be fortified and enhanced.\n",
