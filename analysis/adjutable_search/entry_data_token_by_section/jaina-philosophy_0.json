    "main_text": "Ethics of renunciation: from self-sacrifice to non-violence and omniscience || Escaping rebirths through self-sacrifice\n1.1 Escaping rebirths through self-sacrifice\n\nJaina teaching firstly aims to promote a type of behavior, a method to\nconcretely modify an unsatisfying situation, not by modifying\none\u2019s environment, but by modifying oneself. More precisely,\nindividuals aim at freeing themselves from the infinite cycle of\npainful rebirths. In order to achieve this, they are meant to progress\nwithin a spiritual path thanks to an internal sacrifice based on\nascetic practices of renunciation. The Jain who aspires to final\nemancipation abandons worldly life, notably all her possession. This\ncorrect behavior (samyak carita) consists in an extreme\nself-control. Jainism is an arduous path, in which the disciple needs\nmethods to assist her, as described in length notably in the Later\nChapters (Uttar\u0101dhyayana, 2nd century\nBCE\u20131st century CE [Utt.]). One such method is an\nincitement to cultivate a pessimistic attitude towards the world. For\nexample, the twelve contemplations (anuprek\u1e63\u0101),\nwhich are pre-meditative states, are incitements towards the\ncontemplation of human beings and of their relation to the surrounding\nworld, which prompt the awareness that:\n\neverything in the world is not enduring;\nall beings are helpless;\nwhen an individual is spiritually free, only she has been able to\nachieve it, and only she can enjoy it, no other individual can assist\nand share, each individual is isolated;\nall the relationships of an embodied self are temporary, not\nreal;\nempirical reality from life to death to life is endless and full\nof calamities;\nthe empirical universe is an abode for selves that do not know\ntheir real nature;\nembodied selves are bound in impure, rotten and stinking\nbodies;\nthe influx of karmic matter is the main cause of miseries;\nthe stoppage of the influx of karmic matter is possible by means\nof penances;\nthe purification of karmic matter that is already bound is\npossible by means of penances;\nthe doctrine (dharma) preached by the Jinas leads to\nspiritual freedom;\nhuman enlightenment is rare and difficult to obtain, it is an\nessential duty of all humans to get it prior to their death\n(Treatise on What There Is, TS 9.7).\n\n",
