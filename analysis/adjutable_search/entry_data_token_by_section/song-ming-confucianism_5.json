    "main_text": "Notable Figures || The Taizhou School (16th Century)\n2.4 The Taizhou School (16th Century)\n\nA group of thinkers that was frequently disparaged by many mainstream\nNeo-Confucians was the \u201cTaizhou school\u201d of Confucianism,\nnamed after the place in which its purported founder, Wang Gen\n(1483\u20131541), lived and taught. Although the philosophers most\noften identified with this school were an eclectic bunch, pedagogical\nconnections to Wang Gen and some similarities in ideology and\nscholarly temperament make it convenient to group these thinkers\ntogether. Wang Gen and many of his disciples were distinguished by\ntheir commitment to the popularization of Confucianism. Wang Gen\nhimself had studied with Wang Yangming and took seriously the idea\nthat all people have innate capacities for moral knowledge and\nsagehood, capacities which, on his interpretation, do not depend on\nformal education and book learning to be accessed. Sagehood could be\nrealized through the \u201ceveryday practices of the common\npeople\u201d (baixing riyong\n\u767e\u59d3\u65e5\u7528) and it was the mission of many\nTaizhou thinkers to bring this about. Taizhou Confucians also brooked\nmore dramatic departures from Confucian orthodoxy and tended to see\ngreater consonance between Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism\n(Peterson 1998: 723\u2013732, 745\u2013754; de Bary 1970:\n157\u2013171; MRXA 32.1a\u20137b).\n\nIn addition to Wang Gen, other notable philosophers associated with\nthis school were Luo Rufang (1515\u20131588) and Li Zhi\n(1527\u20131602). Both thought the most authentic and reliably good\nexpressions of our innate moral capacities were to be found in\npre-socialized expressions of the heartmind, which Luo termed the\n\u201cinfant heartmind\u201d and Li called the \u201cchild\nheartmind\u201d. Li also maintained that the expressions of the child\nheartmind could be idiosyncratic, so that moral expectations and the\nshape of moral virtues would resist generalization to a much greater\nextent than most Confucians usually allowed (P. Lee 2012, 58\u201364;\nMRXA 34.3a\u2013b, 34.16b\u201317a; Tiwald & Van Norden\n2014: 304\u2013307). Luo and Li are now admired for defending\nwomen\u2019s education, in part on the grounds of having equal\ncapacity for virtue and wisdom. Luo proposed that women were more\nreliably virtuous than men and played the more fundamental and\nconsequential role in the cultivation of virtue (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 172\u2013179; Cheng 2001: 103\u2013117; Tiwald & Van\nNorden 2014: 297\u2013304).\n",
