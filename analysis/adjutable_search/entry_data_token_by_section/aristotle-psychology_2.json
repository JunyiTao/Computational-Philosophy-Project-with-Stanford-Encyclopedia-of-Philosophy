Hylomorphic Soul-Body Relations: Materialism, Dualism, Sui Generis?\n\n\nIn applying his general hylomorphism to soul-body relations,\nAristotle contends that the following general analogy obtains:\n\n\n\nsoul\u00a0:\u00a0body\u00a0:\u00a0:\u00a0form\u00a0:\u00a0matter\u00a0:\u00a0:\u00a0Hermes-shape\u00a0:\u00a0bronze\n\n\n\n\nIf the soul bears the same relation to the body which the shape of a\nstatue bears to its material basis, then we should expect some general\nfeatures to be common to both; and we should be able to draw some\nimmediate consequences regarding the relationship between soul and\nbody. To begin, some questions about the unity of soul and body, an\nissue of concern to substance dualists and materialists alike, receive\na ready response. Materialists hold that all mental states are also\nphysical states; substance dualists deny this, because they hold that\nthe soul is a subject of mental states which can exist alone, when\nseparated from the body. In a certain way, the questions which give\nrise to this dispute simply fall by the wayside. If we do not think\nthere is an interesting or important question concerning whether the\nHermes-shape and its material basis are one, we should not suppose\nthere is a special or pressing question about whether the soul and body\nare one. So Aristotle contends: \u201cIt is not necessary to ask\nwhether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask\nwhether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter\nof each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if\none and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken\nof is the actuality\u201d (De Anima ii 1, 412b6\u20139). Aristotle\ndoes not here eschew questions concerning the unity of soul and body as\nmeaningless; rather, he seems, in a deflationary vein, to suggest that\nthey are readily answered or somehow unimportant. If we do not spend\ntime worrying about whether the wax of a candle and its shape are one,\nthen we should not exercise ourselves over the question of whether the\nsoul and body are one. The effect, then, is to fit soul-body relations\ninto a larger hylomorphic pattern of explanation in terms of which\nquestions of unity do not normally arise.\n\n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that Aristotle does not here\ndecide the question by insisting that the soul and body are identical,\nor even that they are one in some weaker sense; indeed, this is\nsomething he evidently denies (De Anima ii 1, 412a17; ii 2,\n414a1\u201320). Instead, just as one might well insist that the wax of a\ncandle and its shape are distinct, on the grounds that the wax could\neasily exist when the particular shape is no more, or, less obviously,\nthat the particular shape could survive the replenishment of its\nmaterial basis, so one might equally deny that the soul and body are\nidentical. In a fairly direct way, though, the question of whether soul\nand body are one loses its force when it is allowed that it contains no\nimplications beyond those we establish for any other hylomorphic\ncompound, including houses and other ordinary artifacts.\n\n\nOne way of appreciating this is to consider a second general moral\nAristotle derives from hylomorphism. This concerns the question of the\nseparability of the soul from the body, a possibility embraced by\nsubstance dualists from the time of Plato onward. Aristotle\u2019s\nhylomorphism commends the following attitude: if we do not think that\nthe Hermes-shape persists after the bronze is melted and recast, we\nshould not think that the soul survives the demise of the body. So,\nAristotle claims, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the soul is not separable\nfrom the body \u2013 or that certain parts of it, if it naturally has\nparts, are not separable from the body\u201d (De Anima ii 1,\n413a3\u20135). So, unless we are prepared to treat forms in general\nas capable of existing without their material bases, we should not be\ninclined to treat souls as exceptional cases. Hylomorphism, by itself,\ngives us no reason to treat souls as separable from bodies, even if we\nthink of them as distinct from their material bases. At the same time,\nAristotle does not appear to think that his hylomorphism somehow\nrefutes all possible forms of dualism.  For he appends to his denial\nof the soul\u2019s separability the observation that some parts of\nthe soul may in the end be separable after all, since they are not the\nactualities of any part of the body (De Anima ii 1,\n413a6\u20137). Aristotle here prefigures his complex attitude toward\nmind (nous), a faculty he repeatedly describes as exceptional\namong capacities of the soul.\n\n\nStill, in general, the soul is the form of the body in much the same\nway the form of a house structures the bricks and mortar from which it\nis built. When the bricks and mortar realize a certain shape, they\nmanifest the function definitive of houses, namely that of providing\nshelter. Thus, the presence of the form makes those bricks and that\nmortar a house, as opposed, e.g., to a wall or an oven. As we have\nseen, Aristotle will say that the bricks and mortar, as matter, are\npotentially a house, until they realize the form appropriate to houses,\nin which case the form and matter together make an actual house. So, in\nAristotle\u2019s terms, the form is the actuality of the house, since its\npresence explains why this particular quantity of matter comes to be a\nhouse as opposed to some other kind of artifact.\n\n\nIn the same way, then, the presence of the soul explains why this\nmatter is the matter of a human being, as opposed to some other kind of\nthing. Now, this way of looking at soul-body relations as a special\ncase of form-matter relations treats reference to the soul as an\nintegral part of any complete explanation of a living being, of any\nkind. To this degree, Aristotle thinks that Plato and other dualists\nare right to stress the importance of the soul in explanations of\nliving beings. At the same time, he sees their commitment to the\nseparability of the soul from the body as unjustified merely by appeal\nto formal causation: he will allow that the soul is distinct from the\nbody, and is indeed the actuality of the body, but he sees that these\nconcessions by themselves provide no grounds for supposing that the\nsoul can exist without the body. His hylomorphism, then, embraces\nneither reductive materialism nor Platonic dualism. Instead, it seeks\nto steer a middle course between these alternatives by pointing out,\nimplicitly, and rightly, that these are not exhaustive options.\n\nFurther Discussion of Hylomorphism:\nSupplement: A Fundamental Problem about Hylomorphism\n\nSupplement: A Question about the Metaphysics of Souls\n\n",
