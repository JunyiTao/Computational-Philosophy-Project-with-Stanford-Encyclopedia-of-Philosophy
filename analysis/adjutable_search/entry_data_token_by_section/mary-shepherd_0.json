    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nThe main source of information about Shepherd\u2019s life is a family\nmemoir written by her daughter and published for private use\n(Brandreath 1886). Shepherd was born on an estate near Edinburgh where\nshe lived until she married in 1808. We know she was taught Latin,\ngeography, mathematics, and history by a private tutor who also\ndiscussed some philosophy (Brandreath 1886: 26). As a student, she\nchoose to write essays on metaphysics often faulting the logic of\nHume\u2019s atheistic writings and Priestly\u2019s Unitarianism\n(Brandreath 1881: 28\u20139). Her published works were written after\nher marriage. But in 1802, a controversy in Edinburgh made a lasting\nimpression on her. The incident prompted Thomas Brown to publish the\nfirst of several tracts defending Hume against the charge of atheism\nand advocating a universal constant conjunction account of cause and\neffect. Shepherd mentions this in her first book as a sign of the\npublic\u2019s susceptibility to the pernicious influence of Hume and\na motive for her literary project. ERCE devotes a chapter to\nobjections to Brown\u2019s regularity theory of causes and another to\ndetailed critique of the empirical results regarding the cause of\nsentience announced by William Lawrence, a physiologist who adopted\nHume\u2019s account of causation (on the latter, see Boyle 2021,\nPaoletti 2011, LoLordo forthcoming).\n\nIn the early 1820s, Shepherd accompanied her husband to Cambridge\nwhile he studied for a master\u2019s degree awarded in 1823. Although\nthere seems to be no record of the people she conversed with there, it\nmight well be that William Whewell, who held a university fellowship\nat that time, was among them. The family history records that he used\none of her books as a text book. He was deeply interested in devising\na workable and productive method of empirical inquiry but it was not\nuntil 1860 that he achieved his theory of induction (see the entry on\n William Whewell;\n on Shepherd\u2019s interest in shoring up scientific practice, see\nMcRobert 2002). Her daughter reports that he was a frequent guest of\nthe couple who resided in London. The Shepherds corresponded with\nCharles Babbage, who wrote a treatise on computational mathematical\ninduction (Babbage, 1989). The couple\u2019s social circle included\nmen and women of science, literary figures, and others of intellectual\naccomplishment. She was known for her unanswerable logic and passion\nfor abstract metaphysical reasoning.\n\nIn addition to works mentioned above, Shepherd published three\narticles: critical remarks on the metaphysics of John Fearn, a retired\nnaval officer (Shepherd 1828a), a very effective reply to\nFearn\u2019s counter-critique of her metaphysics (Shepherd 1832), and\nan article on the single and erect object of vision (Shepherd 1827b).\nIn the present article, we focus on her two main philosophical\n works.[1]\n\nThe merits of her work were publicly acknowledged in several ways.\nThere is good evidence that one of her monographs was used as a\ntextbook at Cambridge. Her part of a sharp philosophical dispute was\npublished in a monthly magazine. Her theory of mind and self are the\nsubject of an entry in Robert Blakey\u2019s multi-volume History\nof the Philosophy of Mind (1850). After her death and before its\nrecent recovery, her philosophy dropped from view for reasons that are\nnot entirely clear (Atherton 2005; Paoletti 2011).\n",
