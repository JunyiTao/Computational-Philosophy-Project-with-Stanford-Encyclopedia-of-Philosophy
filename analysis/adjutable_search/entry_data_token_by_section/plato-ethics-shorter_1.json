    "main_text": "Elenchus\n2. Elenchus\n\nThe general rules of elenchus are these: Socrates\u2019\npartner (often called his interlocutor) must answer every question\naccording to his own beliefs, and the partner (not the audience if\nthere is one) judges the outcome. Socrates\u2019 questions start from\nhis partner\u2019s initial statement, which usually implies a claim\nto wisdom or to knowledge of a subject related to virtue. Sometimes\nSocrates seeks clarification of the claim; at other times he proceeds\ndirectly to elicit his partner\u2019s agreement to premises that will\nturn out to be inconsistent with the initial claim. In some cases, the\npremises have no authority aside from the partner\u2019s agreement;\nin others, Socrates provides an argument for a premise, usually in the\nform of an epagoge, a general inference from a set of\nexamples. An elenchus usually concludes in the discomfiture of the\npartner, who now appears unable to support his initial statement. Some\nform of elenchus is probably responsible for Socrates\u2019\nclaim in the Apology that he has demonstrated that every\nclaimant to wisdom whom he has examined has failed the test\n(21b\u201323b). In the dialogues of this group, the elenchus\nis a negative instrument, but in the Gorgias Socrates seems\nto use it in support of his\n bedrock principle\n that one should never commit injustice, the principle he uses in his\nargument in Crito. In some cases, an elenchus seems\nonly to discredit a person; in others it refutes a position that is\nunder discussion. In those cases, it points the overall dialogue\ntoward aporia\u2014an impasse. Socrates applies the method\nto challenge views he probably held himself (as we shall see in the\nLaches), and he implies in the Hippias Major that he\nhas used elenchus to prevent his being complacent with his\nown ignorance (304c\u2013e).\n\nThe philosophical puzzle of the elenchus is to see how it\ncould lead to any firm result, if its premises have no authority\nbeyond the partner\u2019s agreement. Perhaps the method can do no\nmore than convict a partner of confusion (as Hugh Benson has\ncontended), but Vlastos has argued persuasively that elenchus in fact\nsupports Socrates\u2019 ethical doctrine: Socrates believes he has\ngrounds for clinging to beliefs of his that have been well tested and\nnot refuted.\n\nOn the elenchus, see especially Vlastos 1983, Kraut 1983, Brickhouse\nand Smith 1984, Benson 1987, and Tarrant 2005.\n3. Socratic definition\n\nWhen Socrates asks a question such as \u201cWhat is reverence?\u201d\nhe has in mind a question that can be answered only in certain ways.\nTo begin with, he will not be satisfied with an answer that points\nonly to a certain kind of reverence, or only to an example of\nreverence. The answer must identify a feature that (1) belongs to\nevery kind of reverence (generality requirement), and (2) belongs to\nnothing that is not reverent (exclusion requirement), and (3) has\nexplanatory power\u2014that is, explains why reverent people or\nactions are reverent.\n\nThe first two requirements appear in many texts, but the third emerges\nmost clearly in the\n Euthyphro.\n The Euthyphro seems to require that a definition state the\nessence (ousia) of the thing being defined, by contrast with\na statement of that thing\u2019s non-essential attributes\n(pathe). A statement of non-essential attributes could be\ntrue without qualifying as a definition. The statement\n\u201creverence is what all the gods love\u201d states only a\npathos, because it does not explain what makes something\nreverent. We are left to speculate about what would count as stating\nthe essence of reverence; probably it would state what makes things\nreverent in the way that having three straight sides and three angles\nmakes a plane figure a triangle, whereas giving delight to geometers\ndoes not. Clarification for the explanation requirement comes from a\nfurther requirement, that the explanatory cause of Xness must\nbe always X (the synonymy requirement). Hence Socrates\nrejects answers to \u201cWhat is the fine?\u201d that identify\nentities that are not reliably fine (e.g. Hippias Major\n289b;cf. Phaedo 105d).\n\nEuthyphro seems to hold that his knowledge of reverence guarantees\nthat his judgments on this score are accurate, so that he is confident\nthat he is doing no wrong, but he is unable to substantiate this.\n\nScholarly opinion is divided as to whether Socrates is satisfied with\nany of the definitions of virtues that he considers. Mastery of\ndefinitions would be sufficient for the expert knowledge of virtue\nthat Socrates disclaims, so either he lacks that mastery, or his\ndisclaimer is (as some scholars believe) ironic.\n\nOn Socratic definition, see Vlastos 1976, Nehamas 1975, Benson 1990,\nFutter 2011, and Woodruff 2019.\n4. Priority of definition\n\nSocrates seems to assume in these works that knowledge of definitions\nhas priority in two ways: (1) One must know what reverence is before\none could know of any particular action that it is reverent (whether,\nfor example, it is reverent to prosecute one\u2019s father), and so\nfor the other virtues and other cases. (2) One must know what\nreverence is before one could know what properties reverence has (for\nexample, whether it is teachable). The first of these has been\nattacked as the Socratic fallacy by Peter Geach (on which see Prior\n1998); Socrates himself seems to think he knows things which he\nappears to be unable to support through giving definitions. Luckily,\nno text unequivocally assigns either claim to Socrates, and the matter\nis under debate. A charitable view would assign to Socrates in place\nof (1) the view that only expert knowledge on the model of\n techne\n requires the ability to give definitions, and in place of (2) the\nview that we cannot know what the essential features of something are\nuntil we know its essence.\n\nSocrates nevertheless has strong opinions about virtues, opinions that\nguide his search for definitions\u2014for example, that courage is\nnoble or fine (Laches 193d) and that we should pursue virtue\nabove all else. It is one thing to aim at virtue and still another to\nbe able to determine what actions virtue requires, as Vasiliou\ncontends. But if Socrates thinks he lacks mastery of definitions of\nvirtues, then we must ask how he thinks he can be right enough about\nthe virtues even to look for their definitions. This puzzle is taken\nup to some extent in the\n Meno.\n\nOn priority of definition, see Benson 2000 and 2013, Wolfsdorf 2004,\nand Vasiliou 2008. For the view that it is wisdom that is prior, see\nPangle 2014.\n5. Virtue and its Ontology\n\n\u201cVirtue\u201d translates arete, which Socrates\u2019\ncontemporaries used of any sort of excellence that leads to success. A\nnumber of writers before Socrates had used the word and its associated\nvocabulary primarily in ethical contexts. But Socrates was probably\nthe first to identify ethical virtue with what is analogous in the\nsoul to health in the body.\n\nIn Socrates\u2019 usage, virtue is the ability to do what is right\nand resist doing what is wrong. As we learn especially from the\nCrito, Socrates holds that wrong actions harm a part of\none\u2019s self, which he identifies in other dialogues as the soul.\nBecause the soul is more important to us than the body, we should care\nabout nothing so much as virtue, and Socrates understands his role in\nAthens as that of shaming Athenians into taking this most important\nconcern seriously through the care of the soul (29e\u201330a).\n\nIn inquiring after the virtues, Socrates assumes that they have some\nstatus as entities, especially in Euthyphro and Hippies\nMajor. Some scholars have thought this assumption represented an\nearly theory of Platonic forms (Allen 1970; see also Prior 2013 and\nWoodruff 2019.\n\nThe principal virtues of interest to Socrates in this group of\ndialogues are courage (andreia), reverence or piety\n(eusebeia, to hosion), wisdom (sophia),\ntemperance or integrity (sophrosune), and justice\n(dikaiosune), all of which seem to be dependent on, and\nperhaps identical to, wisdom (sophia).\n\nThese dialogues raise two general questions about virtues that are\nimportant to ethical theory, one concerning instrumentality and\nanother concerning unity. They also raise a question about the analogy\nbetween virtue and expert knowledge (techne).\n6. The Instrumentality of Virtue\n\nAre virtues instrumental for other goods, or are they good in\nthemselves? Are they good in themselves or because they promote our\nhappiness? If they are instrumental, are they instrumental in respect\nof themselves, by causing virtue to grow in the holders of virtue and\nin those on whom they have influence? Or are they instrumental in\nhelping us procure external goods for ourselves such as power or\nhappiness? On the instrumentality of virtue there was an important\ndispute between Vlastos and Irwin.\n\nIn a famous passage in Republic 1, which has many affinities\nwith dialogues of our group, a sophist named Thrasymachus challenges\nSocrates to define justice without saying (as he was apparently known\nfor doing) that justice is the beneficial or the advantageous (336d).\nInstead, Thrasymachus insists on the precision that specifies who\nreceives the benefit or advantage of justice; in Thrasymachus\u2019\nview it is the rulers who reap the benefits, while those who are ruled\npay a heavy price. Socrates defends the use of terms such as\n\u201cbeneficial\u201d in defining justice, implying that he would\naccept some sort of instrumental view, but he plainly holds that\njustice is beneficial to everyone who is touched by it. This is the\nmain theme of the Republic, but it also resonates with the\nshorter ethical dialogues, as we shall see. The ending of the\n Hippias Major\n bears on the problem of instrumentality through a discussion of the\nbeneficial as replicating its own goodness (as virtue engenders\nvirtue). Socrates appears to be the first to make eudaimonia\n(happiness, the good life) a goal in ethics. On the relation between\nvirtue and happiness in Socrates\u2019 thought, see Reshotko 2013 and\nWoodruff 2023.\n7. The Unity of Virtue\n\nSocrates argues in the Protagoras for the unity of virtues, a\nthesis that has been variously interpreted and may be supported by\nother dialogues in this group. Vlastos famously explained the thesis\nas bi-conditional: that whoever has one virtue has them all. Others\n(Penner, Woodruff) have argued for a stronger thesis, such that the\ndefinitions of all the virtues would have a common essence. Dialogues\nof definition, such as the Laches, seem to presuppose that\neach virtue has its own definition, but, at the same time, such\ndialogues seem to be moving towards the view that the essence of each\nvirtue is wisdom or knowledge. The Protagoras defines courage\nas the knowledge of what is and is not to be feared (360d), but the\nLaches rejects a similar definition on the grounds that it\ndoes not differentiate courage adequately from other virtues (199e).\nAnd the Euthyphro ends in aporia (at an impasse)\nbecause Socrates is unable to differentiate reverence adequately from\njustice. Efforts to define sophrosune (integrity or\ntemperance) in the Charmides end in an impasse partly owing\nto the difficulty of specifying the subject of the knowledge that is\nthe essence of this virtue. If (as seems the case) Socrates is never\nsatisfied with a definition of a virtue, this may be because the\nvirtues cannot be differentiated.\n\nOn the unity of virtue, see especially Vlastos 1972 and 1994, Penner\n1973, Woodruff 1977, and Rudebusch 2017.\n8. Techne Analogy, Intellectualism, and Moral Injury\n\nTechne is, at the most basic level, what can be learned and\ntaught. The word is usually used for a body of professional knowledge,\nmastered by experts on whom laypeople may safely rely. It is often\ntranslated \u201cart\u201d or \u201ccraft\u201d or\n\u201cskill,\u201d but in these pages it will be rendered\n\u201cexpert knowledge.\u201d Navigation and medicine are frequent\nexamples of expert knowledge. To establish your credentials in expert\nknowledge, you should be able to identify your teachers and students\n(Laches 185b), as well as the specific field of your\nexpertise, which you must have mastered as a whole (e.g., Ion\n532b, ff.). You should also, ideally, be able to give an account of\nthe aim of your profession (e.g. physical health for medicine,\nLaches 190a, moral health for legislation, Gorgias\n465a). Expert knowledge must be rational in its ability to account for\nwhat it does, and rationality in this context seems to consist in\nbasing your decisions on definitions (logoi) that can\nwithstand Socratic questioning. .\n\nSocrates seems to inquire after virtue as if it were, or at least\nresembled, techne, the expert knowledge of living well, or\nthe expert knowledge of care for the soul. If so, this knowledge could\nbe taught and learned. Yet Socrates has grave doubts as to whether\nvirtue can be taught (Protagoras 319a, ff.), and he may be\nusing this analogy of virtue to techne strategically in\nrefuting those who claim to teach virtue.\n\nIf Socrates takes virtue to be a kind of knowledge, then he holds a\nview known as intellectualism. Does Socrates, or does he not, believe\nthat virtue is to be understood on the analogy with expert knowledge?\nIf he believes that virtue is instrumental to happiness (as some\nscholars hold), then he might well believe that virtue is a kind of\npractical knowledge, and the analogy would be helpful. If he believes\n(as other scholars hold) that virtue is at least partly constitutive\nof happiness, and therefore good in itself, then the analogy seems\nmisleading, since bodies of expert knowledge are generally valued as\nmerely instrumental for their goals. If Socrates does not subscribe to\nthe analogy, however, why does he use it in argument? He mostly uses\nit in argument in the context of the larger question whether virtue\ncan be taught, probably on the assumption that, if it can be taught,\nit can be taught as expert knowledge is taught. But Socrates questions\nwhether it can be taught at all. The\n Meno\n will explore a process of learning without teaching; this process is\nknown as recollection. Many scholars are moving to the view that\nSocrates uses the techne analogy dialectically to refute those who\nclaim to teach virtue.\n\nThe word sophia bridges a gap; usually translated\n\u201cwisdom,\u201d it may be used as a rough synonym for\ntechne, but it may also be used for less specific forms of\nwisdom that are not obviously taught or learned and may lack the\nrational features of expert knowledge. When supposed experts fail at\ntasks related to their expertise, Socrates naturally attributes the\nfailure to a lack of expert knowledge; if he does so in the case of\nvirtue, he commits himself to the view that no one can do wrong in\nfull knowledge; on this see the next section.\n\nThere are at least three different positions scholars have taken on\nSocratic intellectualism, best illustrated by their explanations of\ninjury to the soul. For full-scale intellectualists, the only possible\ninjuries to the soul are ignorance and false judgment. For those who\ndeny that Socrates was an intellectualist, injury to the soul is a\nrupture in its order or unity. For those in the middle, it is a\nrupture accompanied by ignorance or false belief. Since the Socratic\nsoul is a unity, anything that theatens to divide it is injurious. The\nhealthy soul is sophron, which cannot in this context mean\n\u201cself-controlled,\u201d as that presupposes a division in which\none part controls another. The associated virtue, sophrosune,\nis more like integrity or undividedness. See Gorgias 482b and\n506e-507a, cf. 475e-476a with Republic 1.352a.\n\nOn techne and the techne analogy, see Irwin 1995.\nFor a skeptical view of Socrates\u2019 commitment to the techne\nanalogy, see Roochnik 1996 and 2002 and Weiss 2006. On the issue of\nSocrates\u2019 intellectualism, see Reshotko 2013, Brickhouse and\nSmith 2013, and Smith 2021.\n\nOn moral injury: Penner and Rowe 1994 and Reshotko 2013 take the\nintellectualist position; Brickhouse and Smith 2010 take a moderate\nposition; Gerson 1997 Weiss 2006 and Woodruff 2023 argue for the\nnon-intellectualist interpretation. \n9. The Impossibility of Acrasia\n\nSocrates\u2019 doctrine on this, apparently, is that knowledge of\nwhat is right cannot be overcome by pleasure or passion. After\nAristotle, philosophers have termed this the issue of\nacrasia. Acrasia, weakness of will, would occur when\nsomeone who knows what is right does what is wrong under the influence\nof passion or in order to secure pleasure.\n\nHolders of expert knowledge are supposed to be reliable in the\nexercise of that knowledge; they are professionals, and part of their\nprofessionalism is to ply their trade competently regardless of the\nweight of passion or the blandishments of pleasure. So the\ntechne analogy might be construed to imply the impossibility\nof acrasia. Socrates\u2019 argument for this in the\n Protagoras,\n however, is based on his demonstration that the popular explanation\nfor weak-willed behavior (that knowledge is overcome by pleasure) is\nincoherent. Socrates is not denying that people do wrong under the\ninfluence of passion or desire for pleasure; he is rejecting the usual\nexplanation for this, and denying that it occurs in the case of those\nwho have the relevant knowledge. Plainly, the doctrine presupposes a\nstringent criterion for knowledge, at least as demanding as the test\nfor techne.\n\nScholars dispute the question whether Socrates is committed to the\nconclusion he draws for Protagoras. The point may be dialectically\ndirected at Protagoras: if virtue is teachable, as Protagoras says it\nis, then this unlikely result would follow. \n\nA related doctrine is that no one errs voluntarily, a doctrine Plato\nholds consistently from the Apology to the Laws. If\nacrasia is impossible, then every moral error involves a\ncognitive failure about the action or the principle that it violates,\nand cognitive errors negative (or at least weaken) responsibility for\nactions caused by those errors. Socrates generally assumes that\nactions taken in ignorance are involuntary, and that therefore the\nproper response to wrongdoing is not retribution, but education, as he\nsays in the Apology (25e\u201326a).\n\nIn the\n Hippias Minor,\n by contrast, Socrates argues that it is better to do wrong\nvoluntarily than in ignorance. Although he is unhappy with this\nconclusion, he gives no direct hints as to how to avoid it.\n\nOn acrasia see Segvic 2005, Weiss 2006, and Devereaux\n2008.\n10. Background: Sophists and Scientists\n\nAristophanes depicted Socrates in the Clouds (421 BCE) as a\nparticipant in the two revolutions that constituted the new learning\nof the period, which were both exciting and disturbing to ordinary\nAthenians: one introduced by the new science, and the other by the\ntravelling teachers known as sophists. \n\nNatural scientists. Thinkers of the period were developing\nexplanations for natural phenomena that displaced the gods from their\ntraditional roles as causes. Socrates is depicted in the\nClouds as involved in this sort of explanation. But Plato\ntakes pains in the Apology and later works to show that the\nmature Socrates is not interested in this project (Phaedo\n96a\u2013d, Phaedrus 229c\u2013e).\n\nSophists.\n \n The Fifth Century saw an explosion of interest in traveling teachers,\nlater known as sophists, who taught a number of subjects, including\nthe art of words, later known as rhetoric. Although the art of words\nwas widely used for entertainment, it also had applications in\ndeliberative and forensic contexts, and the sophists were accused of\nteaching their pupils how to win on behalf of a bad cause\u2014by\nmaking the worse argument into the stronger. Socrates is accused of\nthis in the Clouds: a student emerges from his instruction\nwith an argument that purports to justify a son\u2019s whipping his\nfather.\n\nClever techniques of argument were taught by some sophists, as were\nserious devices for the effective staging of adversary debate, on\nwhich the city-states of those periods depended, both for decisions\nabout policy and for verdicts in criminal cases. Some people felt that\nthese techniques corrupted political and legal processes. Plato took\npains to depict Socrates not only as different from the sophists, but\nas opposed to them on many points. This is a theme in several\ndialogues in our group: Euthydemus, Hippias Minor,\nHippias Major, and Protagoras.\n11. Apology\n\nUnique among Plato\u2019s works, this is a formal speech. The aim of\nforensic rhetoric by a defendant is normally acquittal, but\nSocrates\u2019 aim here seems to be to bring out the truth of his\nlife, regardless of how it affects the jury. Still, although he begins\nwith the orator\u2019s usual disclaimer of speech-craft, Socrates\nspeaks artfully enough that the result could be used to illustrate a\ntextbook of rhetorical technique.\n\nThe official charge is that he corrupted the young men of Athens, and\nthat he introduced new gods; this implies the old charge from\nAristophanes Clouds, that Socrates replaced the gods with\nnaturalistic explanations, and that he corrupted the youth by teaching\nrhetoric, \u201cto make the worse argument win.\u201d Socrates\ndenies having taught anything, and disclaims any interest in natural\nscience or the teaching of rhetoric.\n\nHow, then, did he come under such suspicion? Socrates claims it is\nbecause he led a life that seemed strange to his compatriots, in\nfulfillment of his mission. Socrates claims to have been given this\nmission by the god, evidently Apollo, and he identifies this mission\nwith his gadfly role of shaming people into sharing his quest for\nvirtue. He may have developed elenchus (which derives from a word for\nshame) for this purpose, but he has another purpose for elenchus as\nwell. Once the oracle declared that no one was wiser than he, Socrates\nhad set out to test the oracle\u2019s meaning by examining all those\nwho claimed to be wise. Finding none who could pass the test, he\nconcluded that the meaning of the oracle was probably this: that true\nwisdom belongs to the god, and no human being can be wiser than a\nperson who is aware, as Socrates says he is, of his own inadequacy in\nwisdom. In keeping with this result, Socrates is cautious in his\nphilosophical claims in the Apology. On the subject of life\nafter death, he presents himself as agnostic, although other texts\nshow him to have been committed to the immortality of the soul.\n\nSome scholars have argued that Socrates\u2019 defense is ironic. On\nthis see Leibowitz 2014.\n12. Crito\n\nIn the Crito Socrates states the doctrines most important to\nhis conception of the ethical life. He will give up his life rather\nthan compromise his ethics. His peers would all agree that life is not\nworth living with a badly deformed body; they should agree that life\nis even less worth living with the deformation of something more\nimportant than the body\u2014in other dialogues identified as the\nsoul. Acting wrongly causes serious injury to the soul. That is why\nSocrates believes we must strive to avoid wrongdoing at all costs.\n\nCrito, a wealthy Athenian friend of Socrates, has bribed the jailers\nand prepared means for Socrates to escape from Athens, but Socrates\nrefuses on the grounds that to do so would be to damage the laws\nwrongfully, and this violates his\n bedrock principle\n that one must never do wrong, even in return for a wrong. When Crito\nappeals to popular opinion on the matter, Socrates replies that the\nonly authority he would accept on the matter would be that of someone\nwho is expert on the matter at hand, which is how doing right and\ndoing wrong affect the most important part of a person. This is\nanalogous to how health and disease affect the body. Socrates is\nlooking for an expert who is analogous to a doctor, whose specialty is\nmoral health and corruption. In the absence of such an expert,\nhowever, he must make up his own mind.\n\nHis first conclusion is that nothing matters other than whether their\nactions would be just or unjust, right or wrong.\n(\u201cJustice\u201d and \u201cinjustice\u201d (dike and\nadikia) in this context cover all other-regarding ethical\nmatters, and may be translated \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cwrong.\u201d) Socrates then goes on to argue that they would\ndo wrong if they followed Crito\u2019s plan. His argument uses his\nold method of accepting the reasoning (logos) that seems best\nto him as he reasons about it (46b). The bedrock principle has guided\nhis life so far, and it would be absurd to give it up now merely\nbecause his circumstances have changed (46b, 49ab).\n\nHis second conclusion is that they would do wrong if they followed\nCrito\u2019s plan. The argument leads to a question Crito cannot\nanswer: One should abide by one\u2019s agreements provided they are\njust; would I be abiding by my agreement if I escaped without\npersuading the city (49e\u201350a)?\n\nBecause Crito cannot answer, Socrates personifies the laws and\nimagines their response, on behalf of his obligation to them. (Here as\nelsewhere, with the exception of the Apology, Socrates avoids\ngiving an extensive speech in his own persona.) The argument the laws\ngive is elaborate, and appeals mainly to two points: an agreement they\nallege Socrates made to obey them by choosing to live in Athens, and\nthe benefits they claim Socrates has received from them, which place\nSocrates under a stronger obligation to the laws than he has to his\nparents. Neither Crito nor Socrates can reply to the arguments given\nby the laws, and conclusion of the laws is allowed to stand.\n\nThe conclusion of these personified laws\u2014that one must obey the\ncity in all things (51bc)\u2014seems to conflict with a memorable\ntext in the Apology, as Grote first pointed out; there\nSocrates promises to disobey the court if it should let him off on the\ncondition that he give up his mission in Athens (29d). Scholarly\nopinions differ over how to reconcile these texts.\n13. Euthyphro\n\nA dialogue of definition, the Euthyphro takes up the subject\nof reverence or piety, a virtue that traditionally bears on the\nkeeping of oaths, the treatment of the weak (such as prisoners and\nsuppliants), family relationships, and respect toward the gods. The\ndiscussion here lifts reverence out of its traditional context, while\nmarking sharply the difference between reasoning about ethics and\naccepting authority. The argument as a whole may imply support for the\n unity of virtue.\n\nSocrates is on his way to answer the indictment against him; Euthyphro\nis apparently a well-known crank on religious matters; his name\nironically means \u201cstraight-thinker.\u201d He has just lodged a\ncharge against his father for the accidental death of a servant\naccused of murder. Most Athenians would probably have been shocked by\nthe irreverence of Euthyphro\u2019s prosecution of his father, but\nEuthyphro is confident he is doing the right thing. His confidence\nrests on the special knowledge he claims on the subject of\nreverence.\n\nSocrates presupposes that such special knowledge implies knowledge of\nthe definition of reverence. If Euthyphro knows what reverence is, he\nshould teach that to Socrates, so that Socrates may use the knowledge\nin defense during his own trial. Euthyphro\u2019s first two answers\nfail the first two conditions of\n Socratic definition;\n the first is not general (\u201cwhat I am doing\nnow\u201d\u20146d), and the second (being loved by a god) would make\nthe same things both reverent and irreverent; one god\u2019s love\nwould make an action reverent, while another god\u2019s hate would\nmake the same action irreverent (8ab). Socrates helps Euthyphro to a\nbetter answer (reverence is what is loved by all the gods), but this\nsuccumbs to the requirement that a definition state the essence of its\nsubject (11ab). The essence of reverence cannot be conferred on\nreverent actions by the gods\u2019 approval of them; their approval,\nrather, must follow on the actions\u2019 partaking of the essential\nnature of reverence. So actions are made reverent not by pleasing a\ngod, but by satisfying the definition of reverence\u2014or so most\nmodern readers have inferred.\n\nSocrates then explores the idea that reverence is a proper part of\njustice, without finding a way to specify what part it is. Attempts to\ndifferentiate reverence from justice by appeal to the gods lead back\nto the better answer that was refuted earlier. The conclusion is\naporia (impasse); many scholars believe that it points to a\ntheoretical conclusion, a component of Socrates\u2019 doctrine of the\nunity of virtue. There is no way to differentiate reverence from\njustice in a definition, because there is no essential difference\nbetween them; reverence is simply justice described with reference to\nthe love that the gods bear for justice. Other scholars have held that\nSocratic reverence is the specific duty we have to the gods that we\ncultivate all of virtue in our souls, as suggested by Socrates\u2019\nclaim in the Apology that his mission was given him by the\ngod (Woodruff 2019).\n14. Charmides\n\nThe main theme of this dialogue is the role of knowledge in the virtue\nunder discussion. A dialogue of definition, the Charmides\ntakes up the subject of sophrosune, a word that does not have\na clear equivalent in English. It is the virtue of having a morally\nhealthy soul, undamaged by wrongdoing, and nourished by knowledge or\nwisdom. Sophrosune produces the ability to resist the\ntemptation to act violently in satisfaction of desires, the temptation\nthat, in Plato\u2019s scheme of things, characteristically leads\ntyrants to disaster. But sophrosune is not the same as\nself-control (enkrateia), which presupposes a division in the\nsoul into a part that controls and a part that is controlled. \n\nTranslation. Sophrosune has been rendered as temperance,\nself-control, sound-mindedness, and discipline. Integrity is preferred\nby the author of this article, since the Socrates of these dialogues\nemphasizes the wholeness or undivideness of the healthy soul\n(Gorgias 482b and 506e-507a, cf. 475e-476a with\nRepublic 1.352a).\n\nDates and historical background. The dramatic date appears to be\nbefore the birth of Plato. The main characters aside from Socrates are\nCharmides (a teenager at the time) and Plato\u2019s relative Critias.\nBy the time Plato wrote the dialogue, both men had been killed in the\nbattle of the Piraeus, in 403BCE. Critias had been the leader of the\ngroup known to their enemies as the Thirty Tyrants, and Charmides had\nbeen among the extended leadership established by the Thirty. The\nexcesses of the Thirty, who had conducted a violent and rapacious\nreign of terror in 404\u201303, provide an historical counterpoint to\nthe declared interest of these men in sophrosune almost\nthirty years earlier.\n\nThe topic arises when Charmides is praised for both external and\ninternal good qualities, including sophrosune.\nSocrates assumes that Charmides must have some sense of what this\nvirtue is, if he has it within him (158e). Charmides answers first\nthat sophrosune is a kind of quietness and order\n(159b); indeed, he has a reputation for sophrosune\nbecause of his quiet and orderly good manners. This fails because\nsophrosune is among those things that are always\nkalon (fine), and quietness is fine only in certain contexts.\nThe relevant condition on definition in this case is that of\nexclusion; the proposed explanation does not exclude things that are\nnot sophron. Charmides\u2019 second attempt fails by the\nsame criterion: a sense of shame looks like\nsophrosune in some contexts, but it appears not\nalways to be a good thing (160e\u2013161b). His third attempt is\nplagiarized, probably from Critias, who may have heard it from\nSocrates: sophrosune is doing one\u2019s own things\n(a phrase identical to that used in the Republic to define\njustice). Charmides is unable to explain what this means. Critias\ntakes over, in order to defend his definition, and is led to gloss it\nas doing good things (163e).\n\nSocrates then introduces the issue of knowledge, which Critias agrees\nis necessary to the exercise of sophrosune. But\nknowledge of what? Critias suggests that it is self-knowledge that is\nsophrosune (164d). Critias has in mind the kind of\nself-knowledge that consists in knowing what one knows and what one\ndoes not know. From this it is a short step to defining the virtue as\nthe knowledge of itself and the other kinds of knowledge\u2014i.e.,\nthe knowledge that enables one to evaluate all sorts of knowledge\nclaims (166e). Socrates raises two questions about this kind of\nknowledge: whether it is possible, and whether it is beneficial\n(relevant because the virtue was assumed to be beneficial). It would\nseem impossible for there to be such a kind of knowledge, since all\nother examples of kinds of knowledge have subject matter specific to\neach, and this would be an exception. To know whether a candidate has\nknowledge of medicine, for example, one would need to know medicine.\nAs for the question of benefit, it would appear that such knowledge is\nbeneficial (173a, ff.), because it would allow us to submit all\ndecisions to knowledge. But the appearance is deceptive, because the\nknowledge of knowledge does not add anything to the various kinds of\nknowledge (such as medicine) on which we depend.\n\nThe kind of knowledge that would be most beneficial would be knowledge\nof good and evil (174b, ff.), but this is not the same thing as\nsophrosune. So this line of inquiry has led to the\ncontrary results that the virtue in question is and is not beneficial.\nThe speakers confess aporia (an impasse) and pledge to\ncontinue. Critias and Charmides threaten to use force to wrest\ncontinuing education from Socrates. This is a joke, but it comes with\na disturbing historical irony, because Charmides will follow Critias\ninto a leadership position in the regime of the Thirty Tyrants. Their\nuse of force will terrorize the people, but not achieve what Critias\nwants in the long run.\n\nAs with other aporetic dialogues, we are left without a clear answer.\nAs with Laches and Euthyphro, however, the inquiry\nhas led to a suggestion that goes beyond defining one among a number\nof independent virtues to investigating something of unbounded ethical\nimportance, the knowledge of good and evil. For a recent thorough\ncommentary on the Charmides, see Moore and Raymond 2019.\n15. Laches\n\nA dialogue of definition, the Laches takes up the subject of\ncourage, broadly construed. Unique among ancient writings about\ncourage, the Laches takes courage far beyond the battlefield,\nseeking a definition for courage not only in war but also in\nseafaring, in illness, in poverty, and in politics (191d). The\nprincipal interlocutors are men of military experience, Laches and\nNicias. Nicias is known to us for his prominence in the Sicilian\nexpedition, which has been narrated in melancholy detail by Thucydides\n(Books 6 and 7). He was enormously brave in battle, but a coward in\npolitics, afraid to tell the Athenian people how dangerously situated\ntheir army was. His life in itself illustrates the importance,\nrecognized by Socrates, of cultivating courage in every arena of\naction or suffering\n\nThe dialogue begins with a specific query about military training for\nthe young. A teacher is in town, displaying a new technique for\nfighting in armor, and two elderly fathers (Lysimachus and Melesias)\nare trying to determine whether they should send their young sons to\nthis teacher. Lacking accomplishments, the fathers have no confidence\nin their ability to choose how their sons should be educated, and they\nhave asked the two generals, Laches and Nicias, to observe the display\nand advise them. Nicias advises them to accept advice from Socrates as\nwell, because Socrates has referred him to an excellent teacher of\nmusic (180d); Laches supports Socrates\u2019 reputation, citing his\nactions at the battle of Delium, a disastrous defeat for Athens in\nwhich, as we know from other sources, Socrates showed extraordinary\ncourage (181b). This example will cast a long shadow over the\nsubsequent discussion, for Socrates\u2019 courage in this case was\nshown not merely in defeat, but during a rout.\n\nSocrates makes a move that will become familiar in other dialogues.\nThe anxious fathers have consulted generals, and Socrates thinks the\nfathers are on the right track; they should consult an expert (185a),\nbut for some time Socrates leaves it unclear what subject the expert\nshould be expert about. The anxious fathers had not expressed concern\nabout ethics, but Socrates takes their question as ethical. He assumes\nthat the purpose of any form of military training is to instill\ncourage in the soul (185e, with 190d), and he infers they are seeking\nan expert in that. He then introduces this basic premise: an expert in\ninstilling X must know what X is (190a).\n\nIf there is an expert on military training, then, that expert will be\nable to say what courage is. Laches tries first, with an answer that\nis inconsistent with his praise for Socrates: Courage is staying at\nyour post and not running away (190e). Socrates had shown courage\nduring a retreat, the military maneuver that most calls for courage.\nLaches\u2019 proposal plainly fails by the generality requirement,\nand Socrates shows this with examples of courage that do not satisfy\nthe proposed definition (191a\u2013d).\n\nLaches\u2019 second try is that courage is a kind of endurance of the\nsoul (192c), But what kind of endurance, foolish or wise? Here Laches\nenters a tangle; he does not want to say that courage is ever foolish,\nbecause then courage would not be reliably kalon, as all\nthose present believe that it is, and the definition would fail the\nexclusion requirement. Nor does Laches want to say that courage is\nsophos (wise), since that would entail mastery of the matter\nat hand, and such mastery seems to render actions less courageous\n(192c\u2013193e). Unable to see a way out of this tangle, Laches\nagrees with Socrates that he does not have a good answer.\n\nLaches\u2019 tangle requires someone to specify the kind of wisdom\nthat courage requires, and Nicias is prepared to do that. Courage, he\nproposes, is knowledge of what should inspire terror or confidence in\nwar or any other circumstance (195a). Socrates then understands this\nto be knowledge of future goods and evils. This, as we shall see, is\nvery similar to the definition that Socrates will give to Protagoras\nin the Protagoras (360d). Even so, the proposal will go down\nto defeat. Knowledge of good and evil is not carved up by temporal\nwords such as \u201cfuture,\u201dand knowledge of good and evil\nplainly embraces far more than courage; indeed, it would be the whole\nof virtue (199e). But Nicias has been clear that courage is only a\npart of virtue (198a, from 190cd). So he too has failed to establish\nthat he knows what courage is.\n\nHow should readers take this outcome? Has Socrates refuted the\nposition he takes in the Protagoras to his own satisfaction?\nThe matter is debated by scholars. Perhaps we can apply here a tool\ngiven us in the Euthyphro, where a statement about reverence\n(that it is loved by all the gods) was taken to be true, but not to be\nthe definition of reverence. In a similar way, \u201cknowledge of\nfuture goods and evils\u201d could be true of courage without\nsatisfying the conditions of definition. In this case, that would be\nbecause (it seems) courage cannot be differentiated by definition from\nvirtue as a whole, just as reverence apparently could not be\ndifferentiated from justice. If so, then these virtues cannot be\ndefined independently, but must be recognized in practice as\nparticular aspects or applications of wisdom. Like the\nEuthyphro, then, the Laches could be read as\nsupporting the unity of virtue. But this reading is not obvious; taken\nby itself, the dialogue seems to end on ground that is hostile to the\nunity of virtue.\n16. Hippias Major\n\nThe authenticity of this dialogue has been questioned (see\n Section 17).\n A dialogue of definition, the Hippias Major takes up the\nsubject of the fine or beautiful (to kalon), one of the two\nmost general terms of commendation in ancient Greek, the other being\nagathon, good, nearly a synonym. Being kalon is the\nprimary feature of each of the virtues, and, by implication, the\ndialogue points to an important Socratic idea about ethics: That in\nbeing kalon a virtue is beneficial.\n\nHippias is a sophist from Elis, in the northwest corner of the\nPeloponnesus; he takes pride in being a polymath, an expert on many\nsubjects including rhetoric, history, and mathematics. The question of\ndefining to kalon arises because Hippias boasts about the\nhigh quality of a speech he will soon make, and he invites Socrates to\nattend, along with others capable of judging a speech. Socrates by\nimplication invokes the\n priority of definition:\n How can anyone judge what is fine or foul in a speech, without\nknowing what it is to be fine (286c)? \u201cFine\u201d translates\nthe Greek kalon, a general term of commendation that is often\nrendered as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201camiable,\u201d or\n\u201cnoble,\u201d but often simply means \u201cgood.\u201d Its\nopposite, aischron means \u201cugly,\u201d\n\u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d or\n\u201cfoul.\u201d\n\nAt this point Socrates introduces a strikingly unique feature of the\ndialogue, the Questioner\u2014someone who, Socrates says, will not\nallow him to get away with claims that imply knowledge, but persists\nin asking him shame-inducing questions such as this one about defining\nto kalon. Since the Questioner meets Socrates in the privacy\nof his home, we must imagine that he is Socrates\u2019 alter ego, and\nthat the process referred to is the self-elenchus by which Socrates is\ndriven to his famous disclaimer of knowledge.\n\nThe dialogue reviews seven possible definitions, three proposed by\nHippias, and four more sophisticated ones proposed by Socrates. All\nare refuted, and the dialogue ends at an impasse (aporia), as\nis usual for works in this group.The final arguments do, nevertheless,\npoint to the idea that a good (such as a virtue, probably) can be\nbeneficial by replicating itself.\n\nHippias makes three category mistakes, one in each of his answers to\nthe question, \u201cWhat is the Fine?\u201d (287e\u2013293c) He\nidentifies three kinds of entity that can be fine\u2014a particular\n(a fine girl), a mass substance (gold), and a universal (living the\ntraditional good life). Socrates\u2019 double strategy is the same in\neach case: (1) To show that the answer fails the generality\nrequirement; it does not explain all the cases of being fine. (2) To\nshow that the fine entity to which Hippias refers is not fine in every\ncontext. This violates the exclusion requirement, for it does not\nexclude non-fine things. It also implies that the answer fails to\nsatisfy the explanation requirement; generally, to explain\nXness, something must be X no matter what (synonymy\nrequirement). If fire explains heat, that is because it is always hot;\nbut gold cannot explain fineness, because gold is not always fine; it\nis foul as material for cookware. All of these answers fail for two\nkinds of reasons: because they are merely examples of fine things, and\nbecause they identify things that are fine only in certain contexts,\nleaving unanswered the question of what makes them fine in those\ncontexts but not in others.\n\nHippias\u2019 three answers have much in common, but they range over\nthree different metaphysical types, particulars, mass substances, and\nuniversals. Hippias has attempted greater degrees of generality in his\nsecond and third answers (gold and living the good life), but the more\ngeneral answers still fail. What Socrates seeks is not so much\ngenerality as it is explanatory power.\n\nThe remaining four answers are better candidates and come (as in the\nEuthyphro) from Socrates, though in this case he attributes\nthem to the Questioner, his alter ego. They are that the fine is (1)\nthe appropriate, (2) the able, (3) the beneficial, and (4) pleasure\nthrough sight and hearing. These represent a single strategy, which\ntries to tease out the deeper meaning in the intuition that fine and\ngood things are beneficial. The appropriate and the able are\nattractive answers, but only when they are taken to imply that the\nfine is beneficial. This answer, however, leads to an odd result: if\nto be fine is to be beneficial, then the fine will be productive of\nthe good, and if it is productive of the good, then (apparently) the\nfine cannot be good, because cause and effect cannot be the same. But\nthat is unacceptable; the fine must be good. The conclusion invites us\nto ask whether a good can be beneficial in being able to replicate\nitself. (See Section 6 on\n instrumentality.)\n The last answer (pleasure through sight and hearing) attempts an\naesthetic construction of the fine, and founders on the problem of\ndisjunctive definition. \u201cWhat\u2019s fine is hard,\u201d\nSocrates concludes, resigned to being unable to judge what is fine or\nfoul in a speech until he learns what the fine is.\n17. The Authenticity of the Hippias Major\n\nThe authenticity of the Hippias Major has been in doubt since\nthe middle of the nineteenth century; although many scholars accept it\nas genuine, there are notable exceptions such as Charles Kahn and\nHolger Thesleff. The argument against authenticity is based partly on\nthe silence of classical sources about it, and partly on the style.\nAristotle\u2019s reference to a dialogue called simply the\nHippias is plainly to the Hippias Minor\n(Metaphysics 1025a6\u201313). The style is most likely from\nthe fourth century BCE (Plato\u2019s century), but some scholars have\nargued that its vocabulary places the dialogue too late in the fourth\ncentury for Platonic authorship. The argument in favor of authenticity\nfollows the presumption in favor of the ancient canon of Thrasyllus\n(which is right in most cases) and appeals to the unique and inventive\nfeatures of the dialogue, which betray more artistry than could be\nexpected from a forger. As with a number of dialogues from the canon,\nhowever, the case must be left not proven.\n18. Hippias Minor\n\nThe Hippias Minor shows Socrates defeating a sophist on an\nethical matter: whether it is better to do wrong voluntarily or in\nignorance. Socrates concludes, somewhat unhappily, that it is better\nto do wrong voluntarily. The issue arises in the context of\nHippias\u2019 multiple claims to expertise; he can win speaking\ncontests on any topic, and he has excelled in many different arts,\nfrom shoemaking to the art of memory (363cd, 368be). Socrates asks a\nquestion that at first appears to be about Homer\u2014which is the\nbetter man, Achilles or Odysseus? The tradition has been to regard\nAchilles as honest, and Odysseus as given to lying, but it is this\ntradition that Socrates intends to bring into question. He argues, by\nexample, that an expert in any given field is best able to speak false\nin that field, since an amateur liar might stumble on the truth. It\nfollows that a good liar will be an expert in the subject of his lies,\nand he will also be a good truth teller in that field, and vice\nversa. So if Achilles is a good truth teller, he will be a good\nliar as well, and if Odysseus is a good liar, he will be a good truth\nteller also.\n\nHippias rejects this conclusion. He argues that Homer shows Achilles\nto be honest and Odysseus to be a liar through the speech at\nIliad 9.308, ff., which Achilles addresses to Odysseus:\n\u201cI hate like the gates of hell that man who says one thing and\nhas another in his mind.\u201d Hippias is doubly mistaken in using\nthis passage as evidence for his view. At most this would show that\nAchilles (not Homer) takes Odysseus to be a liar, but in fact the text\nclearly refers to Agamemnon. Achilles takes Odysseus\u2019 word for\nwhat Agamemnon has promised him, but he believes that Agamemnon is a\nliar and that his promise is not truthful.\n\nSocrates cannot interrogate Homer on the matter, so he will\ninvestigate only the opinion of Hippias (365cd), although he will cite\nHomeric texts in support of his position. Socrates argues that\nAchilles is more deceptive than Odysseus, because on several occasions\nhe does not stay true to what he has said. Hippias rightly points out\nthat Achilles had no intention to deceive; he merely said what was in\nhis heart at each moment. Because his falsehood is involuntary, argues\nHippias, Achilles is the better man. Socrates disagrees: the voluntary\nliar knows his subject better and has the better mind. He is therefore\nthe better man of the two.\n\nThis leads Socrates to his main theme: whether one who does wrong\nvoluntarily is better or worse than someone who does wrong\ninvoluntarily (373c). Arguing by example, Socrates shows that any\nfailure, ethical or otherwise, would be better if it came as the\nresult of a deliberate choice, because that would imply that the\nperson who erred had the knowledge to do the thing right if he or she\nwanted to. He concludes: \u201cThen he who voluntarily goes wrong\n(hekon hamartanon), doing shameful and unjust\nthings, if indeed he exists, would be no other than the good\nman\u201d (376b). Hippias cannot accept this line of reasoning, and\nSocrates admits he is uncomfortable with it (\u201cNo more can I\nconcede the point to myself\u201d).\n\nThe argument for this conclusion assumed from the outset that it is\npossible to go wrong voluntarily; this was Hippias\u2019 proposal in\nthe case of Odysseus. But Socrates has assumed or stated the contrary\nelsewhere: no one goes wrong voluntarily (Apology 26a,\nProtagoras 345e). The argument also assumes that people do\ngood and bad actions on the basis of techne; it is reasonable\nto suppose that a\n techne\n that could lead to good actions could also lead to bad ones. But\ntechne can be taught, so that if good and bad action are due\nto a techne, then people could be taught to act well or\npoorly. But Socrates does not believe that virtue can be taught\n(Protagoras 319a\u2013320c). In sum, the awkward conclusion\n(that it is better to do wrong voluntarily) would follow from premises\nthat Hippias supports, but not from the views Socrates elsewhere\naffirms.\n19. Euthydemus\n\nThe Euthydemus is more complex in structure than the other\ndialogues in this group. A substantial framing dialogue between\nSocrates and Crito surrounds and intrudes upon a reported discussion\ninvolving Socrates and two brothers, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,\ntravelling teachers who have much in common with the sophists, and who\nclaim to teach virtue, rather than the forensic rhetoric expected of\nsuch experts (274d). The discussion takes place at the Lyceum, for the\nbenefit of the boy Clinias and his admirer Ctesippus. The main\nquestion in both the frame and the embedded dialogue concerns\neducation: To what sort of teaching should the young be entrusted?\n\nSocrates challenges the brothers to show that, in addition to teaching\nvirtue, they can convince a pupil that he should learn virtue from\nthem. Instead of rising to this challenge directly, the brothers\nentangle Clinias in two verbal traps and are preparing a third when\nSocrates interrupts with the diagnosis (obviously correct) that these\ntraps depend on ignoring the careful use of verbal distinctions\n(277d\u2013278a).\n\nSocrates then demonstrates his method of attracting a young person to\nthe pursuit of virtue and wisdom, which, by the end of the passage,\nhave been conflated into wisdom. With Clinias, he lists various good\nthings: Wealth, health, good looks, and honor comprise one list, while\ncourage, sound-mindedness, justice, and wisdom comprise another. Then\nSocrates surprises the boy by claiming that good fortune simply is\nwisdom; he defends the claim by arguing that no good thing is\nbeneficial unless its use is guided by wisdom. It follows that the\nitems on the first list are neither good nor bad in themselves (281d),\nand that the principal good to pursue is wisdom. We are probably left\nto suppose that the virtues on the second list are identical to\nwisdom. In any event, Clinias now expresses his wish to acquire\nwisdom.\n\nThe brothers intervene with new and more disturbing arguments: it is\nnot possible to speak false or to hold a false view or to contradict,\nthey say, possibly echoing theses of the sophist Protagoras.\n\nThe second conversation between Socrates and Clinias treats wisdom as\na\n techne \n and explores the subordination of one techne to another, as the art\nof the general (winning battles) is subordinate to the art of politics\n(making use of victories). The supreme techne he calls kingly\nor royal, and this is the techne that guides the use of all\nothers (291c), but this line of inquiry founders on a question that\nappears unanswerable: What is the specific knowledge that is given by\nthe kingly techne? A techne is supposed to have a\nwell-defined subject matter, but the kingly techne, which\nrequires general wisdom, would oversee all subject matter and\ntherefore would seem to have no subject matter proper to itself.\nPerhaps Socrates thinks the subject of this techne is good\nand evil, or perhaps virtue, but he does not say either, nor does he\nexplain how these could be the subjects of a\n techne.\n Because a techne is, by definition, teachable, Socrates\nwould have to establish that such knowledge can be taught, but as we\nsee from the\n Protagoras\n Socrates has grave doubts on this score.\n\nA few more traps are set by the brothers, who exploit the similarity\nbetween complete (or absolute) and incomplete (or relative)\npredication: the dog is a dog in any semantic context, but he is a\nfather in relation to his puppies only, and not to his master.\n\nSocrates returns to his framing discussion with Crito on the\noverarching theme of the dialogue, the question of what sort of study\nshould be pursued as philosophy, and this is left as a challenge for\nCrito. The dialogue ends, as do most in this group,\ninconclusively.\n20. Protagoras\n\nThe Protagoras is the most substantial dialogue in this\ngroup. Its general theme is the question whether virtue can be taught,\nand this leads to the question whether virtue is wisdom or knowledge.\nOther topics treated in the dialogue are the\n unity of virtue,\n the\n instrumentality of virtue\n for pleasure, and the denial of\n acrasia.\n\nThe two main speakers divide on these questions in an unexpected way:\nSocrates, who believes that virtue cannot be taught, and that he does\nnot teach it, defends the unity of all virtues with wisdom, even\ncourage; Protagoras, who believes that virtue can be taught, and that\nhe teaches it, denies that courage is wisdom or any sort of knowledge.\nMoreover, Socrates, who elsewhere rejects hedonism, seems to identify\nvirtue with a hedonic calculus in this dialogue, through an argument\nthat leads to his famous claim that of\n acrasia\n (weakness of will) is impossible.\n\nThe setting of the Protagoras is striking: the cast of\ncharacters is the same as that in the Symposium, but here\nthey are gathered for exhibitions of the skill of the sophists,\nespecially of Protagoras. Socrates, speaking on behalf of a\nprospective student, prompts Protagoras to say what it is that he\nteaches. It is, says Protagoras, good judgment, so that one may act\nand speak most effectively both in private and in public matters\n(318e).\n\nIn a substantial comment (319a\u2013320c), Socrates understands this\nto mean that Protagoras teaches the techne of good\ncitizenship, which he takes to be the virtue of citizens, and to\ninclude political wisdom. Socrates argues that such virtue cannot be\ntaught; if it could, Pericles would have imparted it to his sons, but\nhe failed to do so. This argument might convince Socrates\u2019\naudience, but it cannot have convinced Socrates, who was no great\nadmirer of Pericles.\n\nProtagoras responds with an enormous speech, often called the\n\u201cgreat speech,\u201d (320c\u2013328d), which is divided into a\nmyth and an account (logos). Many scholars accept the content\nof the speech as Protagorean, although the setting surely belongs to\nhistorical fiction. In sum, Protagoras thinks that the political\nvirtues of justice and reverence or sound-mindedness are necessary to\nhuman communities, and that all normal human beings therefore have the\ncapacity to acquire those virtues to some extent (although not all to\nthe same extent), just as all human beings have the capacity to learn\na language. As in the case of language, the community teaches the\npolitical virtues to its citizens from early childhood on, and\nProtagoras discusses in some detail the traditional stages in\neducation which he believes lead to this result. He also provides a\ntheory of punishment as educational of virtue.\n\nSocrates does not take on Protagoras\u2019 claims directly. Instead,\nhe takes another tack and engages Protagoras in three rounds. In the\nfirst round, he asks about the\n unity of virtues,\n arguing for the unity of justice and piety, of wisdom and\nself-control, and of self-control and justice (328d\u2013334c). The\nseries of arguments is inconclusive; Protagoras\u2019 consent to them\nis grudging, and scholarly opinion is divided as to their soundness.\nThe series breaks down over the issue of sound-mindedness and\ninjustice. It would appear that one could apply a sound mind to unjust\nactions (say, by not letting sensual pleasures distract one from a\nlife of theft). But Socrates seems about to say that both justice and\nsound-mindedness aim at what is beneficial to human beings, and this\nprovokes Protagoras to affirm the incompleteness of the word\n\u201cadvantageous\u201d: different things are advantageous to\ndifferent species, and in different applications.\n\nThere follows a discussion on how to discuss such issues, and\nProtagoras starts a new line of conversation, this one dealing with\nthe interpretation of a poem by Simonides that seems to deal with the\nacquisition and retention of virtue (338e\u201348a). Protagoras finds\nwhat looks like an inconsistency in the poem, but Socrates introduces\ndistinctions (foreign to the text of the poem) that allow him to read\nSimonides as supporting the Socratic views that (1) it is difficult to\nacquire perfect virtue and (2) no one does wrong voluntarily. Socrates\ndoes not believe, however, that it is wise to discourse upon poets who\nare not present to explain themselves. It is far better for them to\npresent their own opinions (347c\u2013348a).\n\nSocrates brings the discussion back to the unity of virtue, here\narguing for the unity of courage and wisdom (348b\u2013351b).\nSocrates argues that knowledge leads to confidence, but Protagoras\ninsists that this is irrelevant, because not all confident people are\ncourageous.\n\nSocrates then approaches the wisdom-virtue question from another\nangle, that of\n acrasia\n (weakness of will, 351b\u2013358d), seeking to show that there is a\nkind of wisdom that is sufficient for virtue. This turns out to be a\nhedonic calculus that gives full value to temporally distant pleasures\nand pains. Socrates\u2019 argument is targeted on those who think\nthat wisdom can be overpowered by pleasure, as is the case with\nsomeone whose knowledge of the ill-effects of certain foods eats them\nanyway because of the pleasure they afford. If the scale of pleasures\nis the only scale of good, however, and if the agents in this case\nhave the wisdom to calculate correctly the pleasure the agents may\nreasonably expect from each choice, then they cannot be led by\npleasure to choose the worse, or less pleasurable course. The popular\nexplanation for eating what we know is bad for us turns out, on this\nshowing, to be incoherent. Some philosophers have thought Socrates\nsimply overlooked the psychological facts of such cases, but Aristotle\nmakes distinctions that allow him to retain the Socratic view that\nethical failure implies cognitive failure without sacrificing common\nideas about human motivation (Nicomachean Ethics 7). The\nmatter was and still is controversial among philosophers.\n\nDoes the passage imply that Socrates is a hedonist? Protagoras does\nnot accept the narrow hedonism of Socrates\u2019 premise, so it\nappears that the hedonism is Socrates\u2019 own. It is not anyone\nelse\u2019s. And yet we know that Socrates is elsewhere opposed to\nhedonism; his solution to the ethical problem of the Crito is\nbased not on pleasure but on what, after serious consideration, he\nbelieves justice to require. There is no consensus on how to solve the\npuzzle. Could Socrates defend his doctrine on knowledge and\nacrasia here without the hedonist premise? In the\nRepublic he will maintain at least part of that doctrine by\nintroducing a division of the soul into three parts. But if the soul\nis undivided, hedonism may be Socrates\u2019 best defense (Moss\n2014). In view of other dialogues, however, it is likely that Socrates\nis using hedonism to build a trap for Protagoras. Absent hedonism,\nwhat could a Protagoras teach that would amount to virtue?\n\nSocrates now renews the discussion on wisdom and courage\n(358d\u2013360e). Socrates presses upon a reluctant Protagoras his\nidea that courage is the knowledge of that which is and is not to be\nfeared (360d), a doctrine that, in effect, he has refuted as a\ndefinition for courage in the\n Laches.\n The Protagoras ends inconclusively with agreement that the\nmatters at issue require more discussion.",
