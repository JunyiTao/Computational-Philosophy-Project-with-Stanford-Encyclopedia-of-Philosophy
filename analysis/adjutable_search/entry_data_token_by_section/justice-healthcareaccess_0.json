What Societies Do About Access to Care\n\nWe might seek guidance from how some societies assure access to care,\nkeeping in mind that what societies actually do may not coincide with\nwhat they should do as a matter of justice. If, however, there is\nwidespread belief that people owe each other access to certain kinds\nof care, and this belief is embodied in institutions that attempt to\ndo that, it may give us some evidence about what people think they owe\neach other. Of course, we find different institutional provisions of\naccess in different settings, and the differences may not reflect\ndifferences in belief as much as differences in resources or social\nhistory.\n\nNearly all developed countries provide all their residents with access\nto a broad set of public health and individual medical interventions.\nIn these countries access to care is assured despite income and wealth\ninequalities through universal coverage health systems. The method of\nfinancing these universal access systems, as well as their\norganizational structure, varies considerably. Some systems are funded\nthrough general tax revenues as in Canada; others through payroll\ntaxes, as in several European countries; and others through a mix of\npublic and private insurance schemes, as in Germany. Thus some systems\nare more progressively financed than others, since general tax\nrevenues are more progressive than social security or payroll taxes,\nand these in turn are more progressive than insurance premiums. (In a\nprogressive tax scheme, the rate increases as the amount that is\ntaxable increases.) Some systems have public ownership of hospitals,\nwith physicians and nurses as salaried employees of the public system,\nas in the United Kingdom or Norway. Others contain a mix of public and\nprivate institutions, though with extensive public regulation of the\nbenefit packages available to people, as in Germany. Some systems\nallow no insurance schemes except the universal coverage scheme, as in\nCanada and until recently Norway; others allow supplementary\ninsurance, as in the United Kingdom.\n\nThough all of these health care systems assure universal access to all\ncitizens, their benefit packages vary. Sometimes, the variations occur\nat the level of specific treatments. For example, one system might\ndecide a particular drug for Alzheimer\u2019s is not cost-worthy,\nwhereas other systems might provide it. Sometimes the differences\ninvolve whole categories of service. For example, the Canadian\nnational law requires coverage only for inpatient drugs, not\noutpatient ones; different provinces provide different levels of\ncoverage for what is omitted from the national schemes. Similarly,\nlong-term care is not part of the national Canadian system, though\nsome Canadian provinces, but not all, provide long-term care. The U.S.\nMedicare system provides nearly universal coverage to the American\nelderly, but until 2006, when the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act\nbecame effective, it excluded drugs from its benefit package (Medicare\n2003). All universal coverage systems exclude certain categories of\nservice, such as cosmetic surgery (as opposed to reconstructive\nplastic surgery). In general, then, where systems provide universal\naccess, it is access for all to a specific set of benefits that varies\nfrom country to country, not to every service people may need or\nwant.\n\nIt is not only the wealthy, industrialized countries that assure\nuniversal access to a broad range of personal medical services.\nRecently, middle-income countries such as South Korea and Taiwan have\nadopted universal coverage insurance schemes. Thailand and Mexico have\nalso added insurance schemes aimed at covering the nearly half of\ntheir populations that had not been covered in the social security\nschemes and other insurance schemes that are used by civil servants or\nlarge employers. The benefit package in these different schemes is\noften not equal across these components of the health system, but the\navowed goal is to close gaps in access and incrementally to approach\nequality of access.\n\nThe WHO advocates universal coverage in low- and middle-income\ncountries as well as in richer countries (WHO 2010). A key issue in\nthese efforts is the comprehensiveness of the benefit package, which\nin some reforms is a \u201cthin\u201d benefit package that may not\ncover many needed services and that requires significant out-of-pocket\npayments even for covered services. An ongoing policy debate will have\nto address efforts to \u201cthicken\u201d the benefit package along\nthe three dimensions that define it: the number of people covered, the\ntypes of services covered, and the amount of co-pays or deductibles\nfor covered services. Disagreements with the ethical guidance WHO\n(Ottersen, Norheim, et al. 2014) has provided about how to\n\u201cthicken\u201d the benefit package will no doubt be part of\nthat policy debate. Reasonable people will disagree how to trade\nimprovements on each dimension against the others, and a process will\nbe needed to resolve these disagreements. A related issue is whether\nthe health system can sustainably deliver the benefit package the\ninsurance scheme is committed to deliver.\n\nFor many years, the United States stood alone among wealthy developed\ncountries in not providing universal coverage through some form of\nhealth-care insurance. Nearly 50 million people, mostly the employed\npoor and near poor (Selden and Sing 2008), were uninsured as of 2010\n(we note that he number is greater than the population of S. Korea,\nwhich has universal health care coverage). The uninsured are not shut\nout of health care altogether, since they obtain some care at public\nhospitals (EMTALA 1986) and neighborhood clinics, but, according to\nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM 2002), the medical care they receive is\n\u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d Being sicker when care is\nobtained, or getting inadequate continuity of care has a significant\nimpact on their health outcomes, leading to higher morbidity and\nmortality rates, to say nothing of the greater cost of care.\n\nIn 2010, however, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)\npassed into law through a reconciliation act. It contains an\nindividual mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health care\ninsurance on penalty of a having to pay a special tax, expands\nMedicaid (which is a means-tested health insurance program for the\npoor jointly funded by states and the Federal government) coverage to\nan intended 16 million people, establishes insurance exchanges to sell\ninsurance, much of it subsidized, to another intended 16 million\npeople, prohibits insurers from denying coverage because of prior\nmedical conditions, and allows children to be on their parents\u2019\ninsurance until age 26. A U.S. Supreme Court decision (National\nFederation of Independent Business vs Sebelius, Secretary of Health\nand Human Services, 2012) upheld the individual mandate, but ruled\nthat states had the prerogative to expand Medicaid and that such\nexpansion could not be a requirement of the ACA. The failure to expand\nMedicaid in some states and their ongoing opposition to the ACA meant\nthat the expansion of coverage did not reach the 32 million estimated.\nThe increased coverage of the ACA never included the estimated 12\nmillion unauthorized immigrants (Daniels and Ladin 2014), who are also\nexcluded from universal coverage plans in most countries). Given that\nmany of the estimated 12 million long-term unauthorized immigrants in\nthe U.S. count as members of the society, even if they are not\ncitizens, coverage in the U.S., even if the PPACA is fully\nimplemented, will not be truly universal. Nevertheless, unauthorized\nimmigrants still have access to emergency care at all U.S. hospitals\nbecause of EMTALA.\n\nOne of the largest groups of people excluded from access to insurance\ncoverage under the ACA is the group comprised of unauthorized\nimmigrants (who are also excluded from universal coverage plans in\nmost countries). Given that many of the estimated 12 million long-term\nunauthorized immigrants in the U.S. count as members of the society,\neven if they are not citizens, coverage in the U.S., even if the ACA\nis fully implemented, will not be truly universal. To be sure,\nunauthorized immigrants still have access to emergency care at all\nU.S. hospitals because of EMTALA.\n\nAfter the Trump Administration took office in 2017, there was an\neffort by it and the Republican Congress to repeal and replace the\nACA. The House, with a significant Republican majority, narrowly\npassed the American Health Care Act of 2017. The Senate version of it\nfailed to receive a majority of votes, and the efforts to repeal the\nACA and replace it later with a plan to be worked out also failed to\npass. Because President Trump has continued to threaten the ACA and\nthe Republican leadership in both houses put replacing the ACA high on\ntheir list of goals, arguably the victory of the ACA and its goal of\nreducing significantly the number of uninsured is not secure as of the\nsummer of 2017. (We return in Section 2 to discuss further the\nRepublican model of universal access, resting as it does on the\n\u201cchoice\u201d to be uninsured.) \n\nAside from financial barriers to access, there are several important\nkinds of non-financial barriers to access. These include forms of\ndiscrimination and exclusion, such as racism and gender-bias;\ngeographical barriers; and language and cultural barriers, including\ncultural attitudes toward disease and medical care. In the United\nState, for example, we know that the prevalence of certain health\nconditions is much higher among African Americans than whites.\nControlling for insurance coverage, income, and educational\ndifferences, African-Americans are still less likely to receive\nimportant treatments for a range of serious illnesses, including heart\ndisease and certain kinds of organ failure (IOM 2002). Just how to\nexplain these utilization disparities is a matter of ongoing research,\nsome of which focuses on conscious and unconscious attitudes and\nracial stereotypes. Until advocacy groups for women, such as the\nNational Breast Cancer Coalition, lobbied successfully to alter\nresearch funding policy, some women\u2019s diseases were\nsystematically under funded in the U.S. Similarly, there are\nsignificant differences in access to care that derive from the\ngeographical maldistribution of providers, including physicians, and\nservices. Thus physicians concentrate their practices in wealthier\nurban and suburban areas, leaving poor urban and rural areas\nunderserved. Many hospitals face the problem of overcoming language\nbarriers because of the large and diverse immigrant populations that\nthey serve, and striking examples abound of failures to meet health\nneeds because of cultural views about disease and medical care\n(Fadiman 1997).\n\nAll of these kinds of barriers to access act as obstacles to providing\nadequate health care both in the U.S and in many developing countries.\nIf justice requires providing universal access to health care, then\nthese barriers must be addressed as a matter of justice. Some of these\nbarriers to care, such as geographical and cultural barriers, remain\nas such even in systems that aim to provide universal access. All of\nthem would have to be specifically addressed by any effort to move the\nU.S. system toward the provision of universal access.\n\nIt might be thought that the provision of universal access to a range\nof public health and personal medical services would go a long way\ntoward reducing health inequalities among different social groups,\nwhether ethnic or divided by socio-economic status. But, careful\nstudies in many countries, most dramatically in the United Kingdom,\nhave shown that health inequalities by class have not been reduced by\nthe presence of universal coverage through the British National Health\nService (Marmot 2004). Two longitudinal studies of British civil\nservants, known as the Whitehall Studies, have shown a pronounced\nsocio-economic gradient of health across different categories of\nworkers: the higher a worker\u2019s occupational status, the longer\nand healthier her life. In addition, this difference is not explained\nby risk factors associated with occupational status, such as smoking\nrates or lipid levels or other \u201clifestyle choices.\u201d Nor is\nthe gradient simply a result of \u201cdeprivation\u201d\u2014for\nnone of the civil servants are poor, lack basic education, or medical\ncare\u2014and the gradient is present across all occupational\nlevels.\n\nThe Whitehall results are very robust and reveal a strong gradient of\nhealth across a wide range of morbidity and mortality measures. They\nare also consistent with findings found in many countries, both with\nand without universal coverage. All these findings show a strong\nimpact of non-health care determinants of health: income and wealth,\neducation, inclusion and exclusion, including discrimination against\nwomen and L.G. B. T. groups, social cohesiveness, and others. An\nimportant focus of research is to explain the mechanisms that might be\nat work in creating these health inequalities. The WHO Commission on\nthe Social Determinants of Health issued a final report in 2008 that\ncalled for various policy measures that improve daily living\nconditions and distribute more equitably money, power, and resources,\nas well as research aimed at better measuring the influence of these\nfactors and evaluating the impact of measures to redistribute these\ndeterminants of health more fairly (CSDH 2008).\n\nFor our purposes, however, the lesson to be drawn from the literature\non the social determinants of population health is that we cannot\nexpect health inequalities to disappear solely as a result of\nproviding universal access to care. Health care is not the only\nsocially controllable factor affecting population health and its\ndistribution. This leaves us with a question we shall have to address:\nif other factors besides health care are important determinants of\nhealth, then is the focus on providing universal access to health care\nmisplaced? Even if justice requires us to promote or protect health,\ndoes it require us to do so through the provision of access to health\ncare, or should we now modify our view of the importance of health\ncare in light of what we have learned from social epidemiology? We\nreturn to address this issue in Sections 3 and 4.\n\nIt will help to summarize the key points that emerge from this sketch\nof what different societies do to provide access to care.\n\nIf we focus on developed countries, we find a nearly universal\ncommitment to assuring universal access to care in the form of\nuniversal coverage. The methods of financing and organization may\ndiffer, and the actual kinds of care provided may vary somewhat, but\nthere are avowals that universal access is a social obligation, even a\nright, and there are institutions that approximate such coverage. To\nbe sure, some barriers to access remain even in these countries,\nespecially geographical maldistribution of services and inequalities\nin access for some indigenous or minority groups.\nSerious limitations on access remain in developed and developing\ncountries alike. In some, there remain financial barriers, for example\nthe 12 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. and elsewhere who\ncannot buy insurance assured to others; in all countries, there are\nnon-financial barriers to care, often geographical, but also in many\nthere are racial barriers as well.\nThe commitment to universal access is hardly limited to developed\ncountries, for various middle income countries have recently provided\nuniversal access (such as Taiwan and Mexico) or attempted to do so\nincrementally, and there is a recent effort to include low-income\ncountries in the effort to secure universal coverage.\nNevertheless, the actual explanations of why institutions have\nbeen developed that provide approximations to universal access may be\nas varied as the local social histories of these countries, and there\nis no simple way to infer from the presence of these institutions to\nthe conclusion that these are all efforts to promote conceptions of\nsocial justice.\nDespite the belief that probably accompanied the introduction of\nuniversal access, namely that it would reduce health inequalities in\nthe population, we know from the social epidemiology literature that\nhealth inequalities persist, that they are correlated with the\ndistribution of a wide set of non-health care goods, and that they are\npresent across a broad spectrum of the population.\n\n",
