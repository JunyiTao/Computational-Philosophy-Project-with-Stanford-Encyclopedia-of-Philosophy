    "main_text": "Being and Time || The Text and its Pre-History\n2.1 The Text and its Pre-History\n\nBeing and Time is a long and complex book. The reader is\nimmediately struck by what Mulhall (2005, viii) calls the\n\u201ctortured intensity of [Heidegger's] prose\u201d, although if\nthe text is read in its original German it is possible to hear the\nvast number of what appear to be neologisms as attempts to reanimate\nthe German language. According to this latter gloss, the linguistic\nconstructions concerned\u2014which involve hyphenations, unusual\nprefixes and uncommon suffixes\u2014reveal the hidden meanings and\nresonances of ordinary talk. In any case, for many readers, the\ninitially strange and difficult language of\nBeing and Time is fully vindicated by the realization that\nHeidegger is struggling to say things for which our conventional terms\nand linguistic constructions are ultimately inadequate. Indeed, for\nsome thinkers who have toiled in its wake, Heidegger's language\nbecomes the language of philosophy (although for an\nalternative and critical view of the language of Being and\nTime, see Adorno 1964/2002). Viewed from the perspective of\nHeidegger's own intentions, the work is incomplete. It was meant\nto have two parts, each of which was supposed to be divided into three\ndivisions. What we have published under the title of Being and\nTime are the first two divisions of (the intended) part one. The\nreasons for this incompleteness will be explored later in this\narticle. \n\n\nOne might reasonably depict the earliest period of Heidegger's\nphilosophical work, in Freiburg (1915\u201323) and Marburg (1923\u20136), before\nhe commenced the writing of Being and Time itself, as the\npre-history of that seminal text (although for an alternative analysis\nthat stresses not only a back-and-forth movement in Heidegger's\nearliest thought between theology and philosophy, but also the\ncontinuity between that earliest thought and the later philosophy, see\nvan Buren 1994, 2005). Viewed in relation to Being and Time,\nthe central philosophical theme in these early years is\nHeidegger's complex critical relationship with Husserl's\ntranscendental phenomenology\u2014what Crowell (2005, p.49) calls\n\u201ca dynamic of attraction and repulsion\u201d\u2014as driven\nby Heidegger's transformative reading of Aristotle. As early as a\n1919 lecture course, for example, we find Heidegger arguing that\nHusserl's view (developed in the Logical Investigations,\nHusserl 1900/1973), that philosophy should renounce theory and\nconcentrate on the things given directly in consciousness, is flawed\nbecause such givenness is itself a theoretical construct. For the young\nHeidegger, then, it is already the case that phenomenological analysis\nstarts not with Husserlian intentionality (the consciousness of\nobjects), but rather with an interpretation of the pre-theoretical\nconditions for there to be such intentionality. This idea will later be\ncentral to, and elaborated within, Being and Time, by which\npoint a number of important developments (explained in more detail\nlater in this article) will have occurred in Heidegger's\nthinking: the Husserlian notion of formal ontology (the study of the a\npriori categories that describe objects of any sort, by means of our\njudgments and perceptions) will have been transformed into\nfundamental ontology (a neo-Aristotelian search for what it is\nthat unites and makes possible our varied and diverse senses of what it\nis to be); Husserl's transcendental consciousness (the\nirreducible thinking ego or subject that makes possible objective\ninquiry) will have been transfigured into Dasein (the\ninherently social being who already operates with a pre-theoretical\ngrasp of the a priori structures that make possible particular modes of\nBeing); and Husserlian intentionality (a consciousness of objects) will\nhave been replaced by the concept of care or\nBeing-in-the-world (a non-intentional, or perhaps\npre-intentional, openness to a world). \n\n\nEach of these aspects of Heidegger's framework in Being\nand Time emerges out of his radical rethinking of Aristotle, a\nrethinking that finds its fullest and most explicit expression in a\n1925\u20136 lecture course entitled Logik (later renamed Logik\n(Aristoteles) by Heidegger's student Helene Wei\u00df, in\norder to distinguish this lecture course from a later one he gave also\nentitled Logik; see Kisiel 1993, 559, note 23). On\nHeidegger's interpretation (see Sheehan 1975), Aristotle holds\nthat since every meaningful appearance of beings involves an event in\nwhich a human being takes a being as\u2014as, say,\na ship in which one can sail or as a god that one should\nrespect\u2014what unites all the different modes of Being is that\nthey realize some form of presence (present-ness) to human beings. This\npresence-to is expressed in the \u2018as\u2019 of\n\u2018taking-as\u2019. Thus the unity of the different modes of Being\nis grounded in a capacity for taking-as (making-present-to) that\nAristotle argues is the essence of human existence. Heidegger's\nresponse, in effect, is to suggest that although Aristotle is on the\nright track, he has misconceived the deep structure of taking-as. For\nHeidegger, taking-as is grounded not in multiple modes of presence, but\nrather in a more fundamental temporal unity (remember, it's Being\nand time, more on this later) that characterizes\nBeing-in-the-world (care). This engagement with Aristotle\u2014the\nAristotle, that is, that Heidegger unearths during his early years in\nFreiburg and Marburg\u2014explains why, as Sheehan (1975, 87)\nputs it, \u201cAristotle appears directly or indirectly on virtually\nevery page\u201d of Being and Time. (For more on\nHeidegger's pre-Being-and-Time period, see e.g., Kisiel\n1993, Kisiel and van Buren 1994, and Heidegger's early occasional\nwritings as reproduced in the collection Becoming Heidegger.\nFor more on the philosophical relationship between Husserl and\nHeidegger, see e.g., Crowell 2001 and the review of Crowell's\nbook by Carman 2002; Dahlstrom 1994; Dostal 1993; Overgaard 2003.)\n",
