    "main_text": "\n\nSidney Hook was a leading interpreter and proponent of Deweyan\npragmatic naturalism from his years as Dewey\u2019s graduate student\nat Columbia in the 1920s through the six decades of his philosophical\nteaching and writing until his death in 1989. A notoriously scrappy\npolemicist, Hook identified with the attribution given to him as\n\u201cDewey\u2019s bulldog.\u201d\n\nHook worked primarily in the areas of the pragmatic theory of\nknowledge, ethical naturalism, and social and political theory. In\nregard to theory of knowledge, Hook believed that only the pragmatic\naccount of knowledge, with its instrumentalist emphasis, provided an\nadequate explanation of the value ascribed to knowledge in human\nexperience and a satisfactory answer to the question of why knowledge\nwas important for human life. In regard to ethical naturalism, Hook\nargued that a naturalistic account of the origin and justification of\nethical statements offered a critical yet justified and objective\nbasis for moral decisions. In his defense of ethical naturalism, Hook\ncarried out a sustained criticism of opposing theses. These theses\nincluded all forms of moral absolutism that were derived from\ninherited religious traditions or metaphysical systems of Idealism or\nIntuitionism. They also included the variants of what he considered to\nbe moral relativism or moral nihilism, whether these were derived from\narbitrary commitments as in Existentialist philosophy, or were\nsupported as expressions of emotive attitudes as in Logical\nPositivism.\n\nHook sought to apply the pragmatic interpretation of ethics to diverse\nareas of social action including issues of educational policy,\ncultural freedom and societal change. Hook\u2019s application of\nnormative ethical judgments to contemporary social and political\nissues led to an apparent shift in his political allegiances. In his\nearliest writing through the 1930s, Hook overtly embraced Marxism\nunderstood as an application of scientific method for the resolution\nof the problematic situation of capitalist societies. Hook\u2019s\ninterpretation Marxism, however, eventually led him to his becoming a\nleading advocate of anti-communist policy, both in foreign affairs and\ndomestic institutions. In the later phase of his career, after his\nreaction to the programs of the \u201cNew Left\u201d in the 1960s,\nHook\u2019s approach could be understood as a form of conservative\nliberalism. Hook\u2019s initial stress upon freedom of inquiry in\neducation practice was augmented by his emphasis upon the continuity\nin the curriculum of Western humanistic cultural traditions.\nSimilarly, Hook\u2019s initial support for social democracy was\naugmented by his opposition to the totalitarian potential that had\nemerged within socialist and radical movements in contemporary\nhistory. Accordingly, in Hook\u2019s final phase as a public\nphilosopher, his writings were identified with the neoconservative\nmovement.\n",
