    "main_text": "Arguments and Examples || Arguments from ignorance\n2.2 Arguments from ignorance\n\nWe return to Perry\u2019s example of the messy shopper.\n\nPerry explains his change in behavior by saying \u201cI came to\nbelieve that I was making a mess\u201d. As Perry frames the problem,\nno substitution for \u201cI\u201d in the reported belief\n(\u201cthat I was making a mess\u201d) will preserve the explanatory\npower of the belief attribution. Descriptive substitutions won\u2019t\nwork, nor will \u201cI came to believe John Perry was making a\nmess\u201d. What\u2019s reported isn\u2019t a belief in any of the\nfamiliar, tractable, Simple-Picture-friendly categories: it\u2019s\nnot a descriptive belief about the F, and it\u2019s not a\nde re belief about a particular individual. So we need\nsomething additional to capture the doxastic state Perry reports\nhimself as coming to be in when he says \u201cI came to believe that\nI was making a mess\u201d.\n\nThere are two central argumentative threads at work here:\n\nAn argument from ignorance: In the early parts of the\nstory, Perry manifests a sort of ignorance, which drives his behavior.\nBut it\u2019s not (Perry argues) ignorance of any ordinary\ndescriptive or de re proposition. It\u2019s a kind of\nignorance that could survive coming to have all the relevant\ndescriptive beliefs, and all the relevant de re beliefs.\nPerry\u2019s ignorance is a distinctively first-personal,\nself-locating kind of ignorance. That is: The doxastic state that\nPerry\u2019s missing\u2014the one whose absence constitutes his\nignorance\u2014isn\u2019t of the kind that appears in the Simple\nPicture. It\u2019s not a state of believing P for\nany traditional proposition P. So in order to characterize\nPerry\u2019s ignorance, we need more resources than the Simple\nPicture gives us.\nAn argument from difference: When Perry has his\na-ha moment, he undergoes an important doxastic\nchange\u2014one that disposes him to very different sorts of\nbehavior. So there\u2019s an important doxastic difference between\npre-a-ha and post-a-ha Perry. But it\u2019s not\n(Perry argues) a difference in which states of ordinary descriptive or\nde re belief Perry was in at the two times. It\u2019s a\ndifference in belief states of a distinctively first-personal,\nself-locating kind. That is: the change that Perry undergoes\nisn\u2019t one that we can characterize in the Simple Picture.\nThere\u2019s no (relevant) difference in which traditional\npropositions Perry believed before and after his a-ha moment.\nSo in order to characterize the doxastic difference between pre- and\npost-a-ha Perry, we need more resources than the Simple\nPicture gives us.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll pick up these threads in turn, and look at other prominent\nexamples pushing similar lines of argument. In this section, we take\nup arguments from ignorance. Arguments from difference will be\ndiscussed in\n section 2.3.\n\nArguments from ignorance get a lot of attention in debates about\nself-locating belief. They have the same general form as the knowledge\nargument against materialism in the philosophy of mind (Jackson 1982,\n1986): we build a case in which a subject is stipulated to have all of\nthe K-type knowledge there is to have, elicit the intuition\nthat they still display a particular sort of ignorance, and conclude\nthat not all knowledge is of type K. It\u2019s easy to see\nthe messy shopper case contributing to this sort of argument: We build\na version of the messy shopper case in which Perry, before his\nepiphany, is already in all the relevant states of de re\nbelief, and all the relevant states of descriptive belief, but still\nhas something to learn. We conclude that there are some states of\nbelief of a distinctively self-locating (\u201cessentially\nindexical\u201d) kind, that aren\u2019t states of de re or\ndescriptive belief. Perry already believes all of the relevant\ntraditional propositions, so there must be states of belief that\naren\u2019t states of believing P for some\ntraditional proposition P.\n\nWhile the messy shopper example contains both of the argumentative\nthreads we identified above, another famous example offers a\nrelatively pure argument from ignorance. This is Lewis\u2019 (1979)\nexample of the two gods. (Note that in what follows, Lewis uses\n\u201cpropositional attitude\u201d to mean an attitude toward a\npossible-worlds proposition, and \u201cproposition\u201d so that it\napplies only to possible-worlds propositions.)\n\n\nLewis\u2019s two gods\n\nConsider the case of the two gods. They inhabit a certain possible\nworld, and they know exactly which world it is. Therefore they know\nevery proposition that is true at their world. Insofar as knowledge is\na propositional attitude, they are omniscient. Still I can imagine\nthem to suffer ignorance: neither one knows which of the two he is.\nThey are not exactly alike. One lives on top of the tallest mountain\nand throws down manna; the other lives on top of the coldest mountain\nand throws down thunderbolts. Neither one knows whether he lives on\nthe tallest mountain or on the coldest mountain; nor whether he throws\nmanna or thunderbolts. Surely their predicament is possible. (The\ntrouble might perhaps be that they have an equally perfect view of\nevery part of their world, and hence cannot identify the perspectives\nfrom which they view it.) But if it is possible to lack knowledge and\nnot lack any propositional knowledge, then the lacked knowledge must\nnot be propositional. If the gods came to know which was which, they\nwould know more than they do. But they wouldn\u2019t know more\npropositions. There are no more to know. (Lewis 1979:\n520\u2013521)\n\n\nThe load-bearing phenomenon here is a kind of ignorance that survives\nknowledge of all true traditional propositions. By stipulation, the\ngods know all the true traditional propositions, and thus are in the\nstate of believing P for all traditional\npropositions P. Yet each is still ignorant of something. Thus\nthere must be some kind of knowledge whose doxastic component is not\nbeing in a state of believing a traditional proposition.\n\nHere is the general form of the argument, expressed abstractly enough\nthat Lewis and Perry could both endorse it:\n\nAn adequate account of belief will include, for each of the two\ngods, a state that they are not in, such that their failure to be in\nit is a kind of ignorance.\nThere aren\u2019t any states of believing P,\nfor traditional propositions P, that the two gods\naren\u2019t in, such that their not being in them is a kind of\nignorance. (They believe all the ones that are true in their world,\nand not believing the false ones isn\u2019t a kind of\nignorance.)\nSo, the Simple Picture of belief isn\u2019t adequate. To\ncharacterize the gods\u2019 ignorance, we\u2019ll need to refer to\nsome doxastic states that aren\u2019t just states of believing\nP for traditional propositions P.\n\n\nLewis and Perry offer different diagnoses of what\u2019s gone wrong\nwith the Simple Picture, and recommend different remedies. But they\nagree on the Simple Picture\u2019s inability to account for these\nsorts of cases.\n\nThere are a number of other arguments from ignorance in the\nliterature\u2014for example, the case of Rudolph Lingens in the\nStanford library (Perry 1977), which we discussed briefly in\n section 1,\n and the case of the lost hiker in the Desolation Wilderness (Perry\n1979). They are worth noting because they are in some respects less\nodd and science-fictional than the case of the two gods, but we will\nnot take them up in detail because their load-bearing structural\nfeatures are the same.\n",
