    "main_text": "Theories of Legal Interpretation\n4. Theories of Legal Interpretation\nIn recent years, textualism has taken center stage in discussions of legal interpretation. (As the term is used here, it includes both textualism in statutory interpretation and \u201cpublic meaning\u201d originalism in constitutional interpretation. (See section 4.2.) There is a lively debate between textualism on the one hand and intentionalism and purposivism on the other, including a debate about how and whether the opposing positions differ (see, e.g., Molot 2006; Manning 2006; 2011; Nelson 2005). This section examines intentionalism (including purposivism) and textualism more closely. It introduces several distinctions necessary to get clear about what the positions involve and raises important problems for the positions.\n4.1. Intentionalism and Purposivism\nIntentionalists give primacy to the intentions of lawmakers (the legislature in the case of statutory law or framers or ratifiers in the case of constitutional law).\nAccording to these theorists, interpreters should effectuate the lawmakers\u2019 intentions even when they conflict with the meaning of the text. Accordingly, the interpreter should consult evidence of the relevant intentions other than the text.\nLegislative intent is probably the most common factor cited by courts in statutory interpretation, and the original intent approach to constitutional interpretation flourished for a time in the second half of the 20th century (fading in the 1980s). The importance of legislative intent in statutory interpretation and of original intent in constitutional interpretation is often thought to follow from the demands of democracy. A familiar democratic idea, for example, is that courts should faithfully carry out the intentions of the people\u2019s chosen representatives. Though initially appealing, intentionalism has been subjected to a battery of important criticisms.\n4.1.1 Types of Legislative Intentions\nIn the literature on legal interpretation, an important three-way distinction is made between 1) actual, or subjective, intention; 2) conventional, or presumed, intention; and 3) objectified intention.\nAn actual intention is a real psychological state of the relevant body. A conventional intention, by contrast, is a rationale treated as if it were the intention of the relevant body regardless of psychological reality. For example, a court might treat as the legislature\u2019s intention a rationale explicitly offered for a statute by its sponsors or other legislative leaders in reports of legislative committees, floor debates, or the like. Finally, an objectified intention is the intention that a reasonable person would attribute to the legislature under specified conditions. Since intentions are mental items, and conventional and objectified intentions are not \u2013 a body can have such \u201cintentions\u201d despite the absence of any corresponding mental state \u2013 conventional and objectified intentions are not genuine intentions at all.\nThis actual/conventional/objectified distinction concerns the metaphysical status of the intention. A second distinction, not generally recognized in the literature, involves the content of the intention. A lawmaking body may have many intentions with different contents with respect to one provision. A minimal legislative intention is an intention to enact legislation by voting for a particular bill. A semantic intention is an intention that concerns semantic matters, such as an intention to use particular words with particular meanings in a given combination. A communicative intention is an intention, by uttering specific words, to communicate a particular message at a relatively granular level such as that of individual sentences. A legal intention is an intention to create a particular legal norm. An application intention is an intention that a particular type of entity or situation be covered by or excluded by a legal standard. A policy intention is an intention to achieve some policy goal, for example to stimulate the economy. An interpretive intention is an intention concerning what method of interpretation should be used (see Bassham 1992, 29).\nDiscussions of legislative intentions often fail to distinguish between these different kinds of intentions. It is especially common to conflate legal, application, and communicative intentions. A legislature might intend a legal rule that requires (all and only) persons with contagious diseases to be quarantined for two weeks (a legal intention). The legislature might also intend that a particular disease that is in fact not contagious, e.g., psoriasis, be included within the quarantine (an application intention). These two intentions are in conflict with each other, so it is important for an intentionalist to be clear about which one is the relevant one. Similarly, a lawmaker may intend to use a particular sentence to communicate a particular content in the service of creating a complex legal norm, not recognizing that the intended communication is ill-suited to accomplish the legal intention (Greenberg 2011a, 241\u201350). One might think that it would require carelessness to make a mistake about whether a particular communicative content is well-chosen to effectuate a given legal intention, but in complex statutes, the way in which information conveyed sentence by sentence relates to the creation of an intended legal norm is not straightforward (see citations to recent empirical work below).\nThe metaphysical-status and content distinctions cut across each other. In order to specify the relevant intention, we therefore need to specify both dimensions. For example, we might be interested in actual communicative intentions, conventional legal intentions, or objectified legal intentions. Unfortunately, theorists tend to write simply of \u201clegislative intent.\u201d Traditional intentionalists are probably best understood as concerned with actual intentions, but it is less clear where they stand with respect to the second distinction.\n4.1.2 Problems with Legislative Intentions\nAppeals to actual legislative intentions in statutory and constitutional interpretation have been powerfully criticized on several fronts \u2013 metaphysical, existential, and epistemic.[17]\nThe metaphysical problem concerns what would constitute a collective intention of the framers or ratifiers in the case of a constitution or of a multimember and bipartite or tripartite legislature under the complex, competitive, and disunified conditions typical of contemporary legislatures.\nEven if we understood what would constitute the intention of a legislature (or of a constitution\u2019s framers or ratifiers), we face the existential problem: do the relevant bodies in fact typically have collective intentions \u2013 and ones that are precise and detailed enough to be helpful in resolving difficult questions of legal interpretation?\nFinally, the epistemic problem is how such intentions could be reliably identified if they existed. Space does not permit a thorough discussion of these problems with actual legislative intentions. Instead, the flavor of the difficulties will be briefly sketched.\nIt is plausible that groups, such as families, can have genuine intentions, at least when the groups are relatively small, cohesive, and cooperative. In the circumstances of contemporary multi-member bicameral legislatures, however, there are many problems. To begin with, it is unclear what constitutes the relevant group. In the case of the U.S. Constitution, is it a group composed of the members of the state conventions that ratified the Constitution? Or, more plausibly, the group composed of the state conventions, each of which may have its own collective intention? What about the delegates to the Constitutional Convention?\nIn the case of Congress or state legislatures, is the relevant collective intention that of both houses and the president or governor who signs the legislation? Or is the relevant group comprised only of those in the majority who voted for (or signed) the bill? Or is the collective intention constituted by the intentions of pivotal political actors who occupy veto gates in the legislative process? (see McNollgast 1992; 1994). What about statutes that are enacted piecemeal by different legislatures over time? Suppose, for example, that a later legislature amends a small part of a complex statute. In such a case, in interpreting the complex statute, including the amendment, is the relevant intention that of a collective comprising both the original legislature that enacted most of the existing statute and the later legislature that passed the amendment? (See, e.g., Texas v. United States.)\nEven more pressing, when, as is often the case, the relevant members of a legislature have extremely different and often competing attitudes, what makes it the case that a particular intention is the collective intention of the group? Even among members who vote for the bill, there will typically be a great deal of disagreement about, for example, the intended legal effect. (For simplicity, let\u2019s suppose that what matters is only the legislature\u2019s legal intentions, not its communicative or application intentions.)\nTo take a concrete example, in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, the Supreme Court faced the question whether employers could voluntarily adopt affirmative action programs under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which specified that employers may not \u201cdiscriminate \u2026 because of \u2026 race\u201d in hiring. Some of the legislators who voted for the Civil Rights Act may have intended to establish a legal rule banning only invidious discrimination; others may have intended to establish a legal rule banning any use of race. Many members may have had little or no intention with respect to legal effect \u2013 they may have voted for the bill for irrelevant motives without giving much thought to what legal effect it would produce. Granting that groups can have collective intentions in some circumstances, how plausible is it that the Congress and President in fact had a collective intention on the crucial issue in this case?\nIn criticizing intentionalism, contemporary textualists have emphasized the messiness and opacity of the legislative process, and the importance of compromise in that process (see Manning 2001, 71\u201378; 2003, 2408\u201319; Easterbrook 1983, 540\u201341; 1988, 63\u201364; 1990, 444\u201348; 1994, 68; 2010, 916, 922; 2012, xxii; Scalia and Garner 2012, 392\u201393). Individual legislators who originally propose legislation may have a specific legal intention \u2013 to enact a particular legal rule. But, in order to secure passage of the legislation, compromises have to be made. Legislative bargains are often verbal rather than substantive \u2013 that is, they often take the form of adding particular words to the legislation without reaching agreement on the net effect of the change in wording. Indeed, compromises are often successful precisely because controversial issues are left opaque and unresolved. In the case of complex and controversial legislation, there may be no reason to think that there is a coherent and discoverable legal intention. (That\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t a semantic intention \u2013 to use these words \u2013 or a minimal intention \u2013 to modify the law by passing this bill.) Even setting aside the metaphysical question of what would constitute a collective intention in the relevant circumstances, it is often extremely implausible that a collective legal intention exists and that, if it did, courts could reliably identify it.\nIt is even less likely that the legislature has communicative intentions with respect to most provisions that generate interpretive controversies. Recall that a communicative intention is an intention to communicate a particular message by uttering specific words. Most members of the legislature will not have read a typical provision and, in statutes of any complexity, lack the technical skill to understand what message would need to be communicated in order to create a particular legal norm or achieve a specific policy goal. (For recent empirical work suggesting that members of the legislature rarely engage with the details of the statutory text and, even if they did, would not be capable of working out whether the text is well calculated to effect their legal or policy intentions, see Bressman and Gluck 2013; 2014.) Thus, even if members of the legislature had relevant legal intentions with respect to provisions that are at the center of interpretive disputes, it is far-fetched to take them to have corresponding communicative intentions.\nIn response to skeptics who make these kinds of points \u2013 for example, that many individual legislators do not have the relevant intentions, and that, even when they do, the intentions of individual legislators conflict with each other \u2013 it is sometimes objected that individual legislators\u2019 intentions are not the issue. Despite difficulties regarding individual intentions, the legislature as an institution may still have a collective intention.\nIt is plausible that collective intentions are not mere aggregations of individual intentions. But pointing out the mere possibility that a collective intention exists, despite deep conflict between \u2013 and in many cases an absence of \u2013 individual intentions, does not take us very far.\nAccording to the most developed proposal, because the legislature has a standing secondary intention \u201cto stand ready to change the law when there is good reason to do so,\u201d which all legislators share, when the legislature enacts a bill, the legislature has a primary legal intention whose content is the content of the bill, regardless of the intentions of individual legislators (Ekins and Goldsworthy 2014, 65; Ekins 2012, 56\u201358, 224). The proposal faces an uphill battle to establish the psychological reality of its central claim. The proposal runs into further difficulty by explicating the \u201ccontent of the bill\u201d as what the speaker intended to communicate (which may go well beyond the literal meaning of the text) (Ekins 2012, chap. 7; Ekins and Goldsworthy 2014, 66\u201367).[18] The proposal therefore seems to address worries about the existence of collective legislative intentions by appealing to a collective legislative intention. In addition, in the case of contemporary legislation, it is typical that a form of words is chosen as a compromise in order to enable a bill to pass without agreement on what that form of words is to communicate (or what legal norm it is to create). See section 4.2. So it is question begging to assume the existence of the crucial communicative intention that is supposed to constitute the content of the text and, in turn, the legislature\u2019s primary intention. When the verbal formulation constitutes the compromise, it is of no help to say that \u201cthe nature of [legislators\u2019] compromise may be discernible from the text and publicly available contextual and purposive evidence\u201d (Ekins and Goldsworthy 2014, 66).\n4.1.3 The Relevance of Different Kinds of Legislative Intentions\nThere is another type of problem with the suggestion about collective intention. Suppose that a philosopher develops an account of what constitutes the collective intention of a large, diverse group whose members\u2019 attitudes conflict with each other. According to this account, let\u2019s further suppose, the collective intention of such a group depends in a complex way on how the group would behave in various counterfactual circumstances. (One complication is that it might be that what constitutes the collective intention of a group is relative to the purposes for which the question is asked. But let\u2019s set this complication aside for the sake of argument.) Even if the philosopher\u2019s account is a correct account of the nature of group minds, it is a further question whether and to what extent legal interpretation should care about the intentions specified by such an account. That question cannot be resolved by the philosophy of mind, for the answer depends on distinctively legal concerns, and the details of the putative account of collective intentions would obviously matter.\nThe issue concerns not the nature, existence, or ascertainment of the intentions, but to what extent they should make a difference in legal interpretation. Suppose that, according to the hypothetical philosophical account of group minds, the legislature that enacted a particular provision had a collective intention that supports an interpretation not discernible from the words of the provision. Allowing such a legislative intention to control the provision\u2019s interpretation raises serious questions of democracy, rule of law, and fairness. For example, rule of law values require that legal rules be readily publicly available. Democratic values militate against the relevance of legislative intentions that were not expressed in the bills voted on by the legislature. (This kind of point is closely related to familiar textualist arguments against the use of legislative history (see section 4.2).\nThis issue is really an aspect of a larger issue about the relevance of different kinds of legislative intentions in light of what legal interpretation seeks. For example, if legal interpretation seeks the linguistic meaning of the relevant legal texts, then legal, as opposed to semantic and communicative, intentions will have little or no relevance. The linguistic meaning of a text does not depend on what legal rules people intend to create by adopting the text.[19] Similarly, application intentions are only weak evidence of linguistic meaning. By contrast, for example, communicative intentions are highly relevant to pragmatically conveyed content such as speaker meaning (see section 4.2 and entries on Pragmatics; Implicature; Paul Grice).\nOn the other hand, if legal interpretation seeks a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law, then the relevance of different legislative intentions depends on the bearing of those intentions on the content of the law. Does the content of the law depend on what legal rule the legislature actually intended? Or on what legal rule a reasonable person under specified circumstances would have taken a hypothetical coherent lawmaker to have intended to create by uttering the words of the provision? Or, perhaps, on what the legislature asserted or said? Normative arguments might be relevant at this juncture. For example, there may be reasons of democracy why legal intentions have an important bearing on the content of the law only if they are publicly available in certain authoritative sources.\nOne variation on actual legislative intention is counterfactual intention (see Posner 1986). To say that the legislature had a particular counterfactual intention is to say that, if the legislature had considered the relevant issue, it would have had the intention in question. The metaphysical, existential, and epistemic problems are especially severe for counterfactual intentions. Moreover, because the focus is on what the legislature would have intended with respect to the specific issue before the court, counterfactual intentions tend to be understood as counterfactual application intentions rather than as counterfactual legal or communicative intentions. And the relevance of application intentions to legal interpretation is especially problematic. (see Greenberg and Litman 1998; Berman 2007, 385; 2009, 28; McConnell 1997, 1284; Whittington 2013, 382\u201383).\nConventional intentions exist and can be identified when the relevant sources, such as committee reports, floor debates, and the like, identify rationales for the relevant legislation. Of course, when the sources identify conflicting rationales, the existence of conventional intentions becomes problematic. More fundamentally, however, there are well-known objections to treating conventional intentions as consequential. As critics of the use of legislative history have emphasized, it is relatively easy for legislators to insert ostensible purposes for legislation into the legislative history (see Scalia 1997, 29\u201337; Scalia and Garner 2012, 376\u201378; Easterbrook 1990, 448\u201349; 1994, 65). Such rationales are often offered with extraneous motives, such as to defeat the legislation by making its purposes seem unacceptably broad or to increase the chances of passage by making the purposes seem unexceptionable. There is no reason in general to take such proffered rationales as representative of the attitudes of members of the legislature, and they are not part of what is voted on by the legislature. Probably for this kind of reason, conventional intentions are assigned a relatively minor role by most contemporary theorists of legal interpretation. For a critique of reliance on conventional intentions, see Eskridge 1994, 18\u201321.\n4.1.4 Objectified Intentions and Purposivism\nObjectified intentions are imputed to the legislature by making various, typically counterfactual, assumptions about the audience and the author of the legislation. For example, we might ask what legal norm a reasonable person would have taken a coherent and reasonable lawmaker to have intended to create by enacting the words of a statutory provision.\nBecause there are many possible objectified intentions of the legislature depending on what idealizing assumptions are made, any specific set of assumptions needs defense. Talk of objectified intentions is, in fact, misleading; the methodology of asking what a reasonable member of the audience would attribute, given certain stipulations, is really just a way of constructing a content \u2013 whether that content is taken to be an intention, a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law, a linguistic content, or something else.\nPurposivism is best understood as a form of intentionalism that is concerned with objectified intentions. Given the closeness in meaning of the terms intentions and purposes, it is confusing that intentionalism and purposivism are frequently distinguished in the legal interpretation literature. The term intentionalism tends to be used for positions that focus on relatively specific communicative, application, or legal intentions of the legislature that enacted the statute, while purposivism is reserved for positions that give central place to more general legal or policy purposes that might reasonably be attributed to the statute.\nAccording to the seminal account of purposivism, interpreters should \u201cdecide what purpose ought to be attributed to the statute and to any subordinate provision of it which may be involved\u201d on the assumption that the statute consisted of \u201creasonable persons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably\u201d (Hart and Sacks 1994, 1374, 1378). This formulation makes clear that the relevant purpose is not that of any actual person or body, but a purpose that is imputed based on an idealization. In addition, the meaning of the words is to be subordinated to the objectified purpose: purposivists \u201c[i]nterpret the words of the statute immediately in question so as to carry out the purpose\u201d as well as possible (Hart and Sacks 1994, 1374). Barak (2005, chaps. 6\u20138) develops a more complex position that gives a role to both actual and objectified purpose.\nAs noted, the relevant type of purpose seems to be legal or even policy, certainly not semantic or communicative (see Eskridge 1993, 1744\u201345; 1994, 29; Hart and Sacks 1994, 148; Barak 2005; Dickerson 1975, 88\u201390; Manning 2006; Scalia and Garner 2012, 35\u201339). The famous purposivist case of Church of the Holy Trinity illustrates this point. The case concerned whether a statute that made it unlawful to facilitate the immigration of a foreigner under a pre-existing contract to perform \u201clabor or service of any kind\u201d applied to a church\u2019s attempt to hire an English minister. The Supreme Court relied on evidence outside of the text of the statute to find that the purpose of the statute was limited to regulating the immigration of manual laborers, though the Court conceded that the meaning of the words covered the work of a clergyman.\nWriters have criticized purposivism on the ground that the assumption that the legislature consists of reasonable people with reasonable purposes is false (Posner 1985, 288\u201389). The assumption is best understood not as an empirical one, however, but as an idealizing stipulation used to construct a content. As noted, objectified intentions are not genuine intentions at all. Purposivism, like any theory of legal interpretation that appeals to constructed contents based on counterfactual assumptions, faces challenges both to specify the relevant assumptions in a way that yields a unique content and, more fundamentally, to explain why the content thus constructed should be given primacy in legal interpretation (see further discussion in section 4.2). For example, the simple democratic rationale that may seem to support an appeal to actual intentions \u2013 that courts should carry out the intentions of the elected representatives of the people \u2013 does not apply to objectified intentions, as they are not in fact the intentions of the legislature.\n4.1.5 Linguistically Motivated Intentionalism\nTraditional forms of intentionalism were motivated by democratic ideas, including especially the idea that the courts should be faithful agents of the legislature. A relatively recent development is the emergence of a strong form of intentionalism driven by linguistic arguments.\nOne popular argument starts from the premise that sounds or marks produced without intentions are meaningless. Proponents of this argument take this premise to imply that a text means whatever the author intends it to mean. From this proposition, they conclude that legal interpretation must seek the intention of the legislature. In light of the claim that a text means whatever the author intends, the relevant intention is best understood as a communicative intention, and some of the theorists in this camp are explicit on this point. Also, given the nature of the argument, the relevant intentions must be actual intentions. Proponents of this kind of intentionalism often tend to be surprisingly unconcerned about whether the relevant communicative intentions exist and, if so, how they could be ascertained.[20]\nEven if we grant for the sake of argument the not-at-all-obvious premise that marks without intentions are meaningless, the proposition that a text means whatever the author intends does not follow (see Sinnott-Armstrong 2005; Berman 2009, 47-49) \u2013 and it is false. Given the premise, the marks \u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d would have no meaning unless their maker produced them intentionally. So, let\u2019s assume that an author produces those marks intentionally \u2013 specifically, with the intention of using those words in English \u2013 and, in addition, intends the words to mean that dogs are carnivorous. Regardless of the latter intention, the sentence \u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d does not mean that dogs are carnivorous, though (by hypothesis) the speaker, in uttering it, means that dogs are carnivorous.\nThe argument runs roughshod over the distinction between word meaning and speaker meaning. The proponents of the argument deny the existence of word meaning, claiming, in effect, that the only meaning is speaker meaning. But their argument does not support the denial, and much of what speakers mean (and successfully communicate) would not be possible if it were not for word meaning.[21] You could not use the words, \u201cchildren under 11 may enter free\u201d to mean that children 11 and over must pay for admission if the words did not have a stable conventional meaning in English.\nThere is a more fundamental and more interesting problem with the position \u2013 one that is endemic to much literature on legal interpretation. The position moves without argument from a claim about linguistic meaning to a conclusion about the correct method of legal interpretation. Even if it were true that a text meant whatever the speaker meant or intended to communicate, it would not follow that legal interpretation should seek the speaker\u2019s communicative intention. Substantive argument is needed to derive claims about legal interpretation from claims about language and communication. As set out above, there are powerful reasons for thinking that legal interpretation seeks at least a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law. (Even if it seeks the overall best resolution of disputes, it must still ascertain a provision\u2019s contribution, given the importance of the law to the resolution of disputes.) A provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law may be something other than its linguistic meaning, such as the objectified legal intention, the best justification for the enactment of the provision, or a complex function of multiple factors.[22] And there are strong reasons for rejecting the general proposition that the legal impact of an action is constituted by the actor\u2019s communicative intention (see Greenberg 2011a).\n4.2 Textualism\nIn recent decades, in part in reaction to skepticism about actual legislative intentions, theorists of both statutory and constitutional interpretation have moved away from accounts that focus on intentions. One important trend has been toward textualism in statutory interpretation and \u201cpublic meaning\u201d originalism in constitutional interpretation. (Textualism here will be used to encompass public meaning originalism, including the position of the so-called new originalists.[23])\nThe core idea of textualism is that the text prevails over other factors. Traditional textualism focused on \u201cplain meaning\u201d and held that, if the plain meaning is clear, a court should not consult other indications of legislative intent. This older textualism saw itself as seeking legislative intent, but took the position that a clear text is the best evidence of that intent.\nThe focus here will be on a more recently influential form of textualism, sometimes called new textualism. New textualists are skeptical about the existence of coherent and discoverable legislative intentions. For reasons for such skepticism, see section 4.1. They emphasize, not plain meaning, but a reasonable reading of the text in context.\nTextualism\u2019s emphasis on the text has to be understood as an emphasis on the linguistic meaning of the text, rather than the text understood as marks on a page. Within linguistic meaning, there are two basic types: semantic content and pragmatically conveyed content (or pragmatic content, for short). See entry on Pragmatics. There is a lively debate in philosophy of language and linguistics over how exactly to draw the line between semantics and pragmatics. Roughly speaking, however, semantic content is what is conventionally encoded in the words, and pragmatic content is what a speaker or author, by an utterance of words on a particular occasion in a particular context, manages to convey beyond, or different from, the semantic content of the words.[24] Central to pragmatic content are the communicative intentions of the speaker. To take a well-known type of example, when one says to a new acquaintance at a dinner party, \u201cI have three children,\u201d one likely intends to communicate that one has exactly three children and the hearer will likely recognize that intention, though the literal meaning of the words is that one has at least three children. This chapter uses \u201clinguistic content\u201d to encompass both semantic content and pragmatic content.\nOn the face of it, pragmatic content seems a poor candidate for what textualists are after, given their skepticism about legislative intentions (though we will see that much of what they say points toward pragmatic content nevertheless).\nGiven textualism\u2019s emphasis on text and objective meaning, it would be natural to understand it as seeking semantic content.[25] This cannot be the right understanding of contemporary textualism, however. Leading textualists explicitly reject literal meaning (a rough synonym for semantic content), which they associate with the more traditional \u201cplain meaning\u201d textualism. They insist that textualism seeks a reasonable reading in context, not a literal one (Scalia 1997, 23\u201324; Easterbrook 1994, 64, 67; Manning 2001, 108\u201315; 2003, 2457\u201358; 2006, 79\u201381; see also Whittington 1999a, 176\u201377). As Justice Scalia puts it: \u201cA text should not be construed strictly\u2026; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means\u201d (Scalia 1997, 23).\nAt first blush, the idea of a reasonable reading seems hard to quarrel with. On closer examination, however, it raises a host of problems largely unrecognized by textualists. To begin with, what is reasonable depends on what one seeks and what one knows or believes.\nIn ordinary communication, in interpreting a note from one\u2019s spouse or an instruction manual, say, the goal is normally to identify what the speaker or author meant or intended to communicate, as opposed, for example, to what the words literally mean or what a reasonable person with certain assumptions would take the speaker to have intended to communicate. In other words, one is successful in interpreting in ordinary communication just to the extent that one accurately recovers what the speaker intended to communicate.[26] A reasonable interpretation in a conversational setting is therefore one that is reasonably calculated to recover the speaker\u2019s communicative intentions given the audience\u2019s beliefs about the speaker and the situation. On the other hand, if one is engaged in a different enterprise \u2013 playing a word game, trying to decide whether a witness committed perjury (see Bronston v. United States), interpreting a poem, or working out the impact on the law of the enactment of a provision \u2013 what is reasonable might be quite different. Textualists do not clearly address what a reasonable reader is supposed to be seeking in part because they have not recognized the issue, saying things that point in different directions.\nSome examples that textualists offer suggest that they are assuming the model of ordinary communication. In the well-known case of Smith v. United States, Smith had offered to trade a gun for cocaine. The Supreme Court divided over the question whether he was properly sentenced under a statute that provides for increased penalties if the defendant \u201cuses \u2026 a firearm\u201d in a drug-trafficking or violent crime. In a much-quoted dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia pointed out that \u201cWhen someone asks \u2018Do you use a cane?\u2019 he is not inquiring whether you have your grandfather\u2019s silver handled walking stick on display in the hall; he wants to know whether you walk with a cane\u201d (508 U.S. 223, 242; see Manning 2003, 2460). Properly understood, the example illustrates that, in ordinary conversation, in the imagined situation, the speaker would likely intend to ask whether you walk with a cane. The communication would therefore be successful if the audience correctly identified that intention.[27] Textualists also endorse the use of linguistic canons of interpretation that, properly understood, are rules of thumb for inferring what a speaker likely intended to communicate, as opposed to the literal meaning of the words (e.g., Scalia 1997, 25\u201326).[28]\nThus, the examples that textualists give involving the interpretation of ordinary communications and their use of certain canons of interpretation suggest that the relevant inquiry is what it would be reasonable to take the speaker to intend to communicate. Indeed, textualists often assert that what words mean is what a reasonable person would take the speaker to mean or to intend to convey \u2013 thus confusing word meaning with reasonable inferences about communicative intent (e.g., Scalia and Garner 2012, 16, 56). Similarly, textualists often say that the relevant inquiry is \u201cobjectified legal intention,\u201d understood as what a reasonable person, given the context, would take the legislature to have intended.[29]\nThe notion of what a reasonable person would take the speaker to have intended to communicate is coherent (though what a reasonable person would take the speaker to have intended to communicate is not the meaning of a text or utterance). In the case of legislation, however, by the textualists\u2019 own lights, it is not reasonable to take the legislature to have intended to communicate anything. (For skepticism about legislative intentions, see section 4.1)\nA textualist could respond by suggesting that we stipulate fictional assumptions about the speaker or the situation. In this way, we could construct counterfactual-based contents. Plainly, we would get diverse such contents depending on which stipulations we make (see Alexander 2011, 91\u201393). For example, one might ask what a reasonable person would have taken the speaker\u2019s communicative intention to be if the text of a provision had been uttered by one rational speaker in ordinary conversation with the goal of communicating a message. It is important to note that, as stated, the answer to this question will likely be indeterminate \u2013 that is, without more specification of, for example, the reasonable person\u2019s beliefs about the speaker and the conversational context, there will be no fact of the matter as to what the reasonable person would have taken the speaker\u2019s intention to be. Moreover, fleshing out the counterfactual situation in a specific way, rather than indefinitely many others, needs to be justified. Why should legal interpretation be concerned with what a reasonable person would take a speaker to intend under this particular set of fictional assumptions? (See Greenberg 2020, 116\u2013124, for extended discussion of the options available to textualism and difficulties with those options.)\n5. How to Argue for and Evaluate Theories of Legal Interpretation\n5.1 Theories of Legal Interpretation and Theories of Law\nIn the literature on legal interpretation, theorists offer various arguments in favor of their preferred theories of legal interpretation. As noted, normative arguments, appealing to moral values such as democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, are the most common. For example, both textualists and intentionalists offer arguments based on democracy (see Eskridge 1994, 13; Eskridge and Frickey 1990, 326; Barak 2005, 248; Alexander 2013, 540; Easterbrook 1994, 63). According to Justice Scalia, \u201cit is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawgiver promulgated.\u201d (Scalia 1997, 17.)\nTypical linguistic arguments defend a particular approach to legal interpretation by appealing to claims about how language or communication works. For example, in section 3, we saw that a recent form of intentionalism is defended on the ground that any linguistic text must mean whatever its author intends it to mean. And theorists influenced by philosophy of language have argued that the proper approach to legal interpretation is to find the total pragmatically conveyed content of the legal texts, on the ground that that is what linguistic interpretation normally seeks.[30]\nConceptual arguments claim that a particular approach to legal interpretation follows from the concept of interpretation, the concept of law, the concept of authority, or some other relevant concept (e.g., Neale 2012 [Other Internet Resources]; see Berman 2009, 37\u201368). For example, as noted in section 2, some writers have argued that any approach to a text that does not seek the intentions of the author does not count as interpretation (Fish 2005; Graglia 1992).[31]\nSuch arguments for particular theories of legal interpretation are typically offered without any account of why these arguments are the relevant ones and often without consideration of other kinds of arguments. What is the appropriate way to choose between competing theories of legal interpretation? What kinds of arguments are relevant? How do we adjudicate between competing arguments if they conflict? It is unusual for theorists to explicitly address the question of how to choose between competing theories of interpretation. For exceptions, see, e.g., Shapiro 2009 chaps. 1, 12\u201313; Greenberg 2017a; Fallon 1999.\nSection 2 made the point that which method of legal interpretation is correct \u2013 and which reasons or arguments count in favor of a method \u2013 depends on what legal interpretation seeks. To a first approximation, whether a method of legal interpretation is correct depends on whether it reliably yields what legal interpretation seeks. For example, if legal interpretation seeks the best resolution of disputes, then a method of legal interpretation is correct if, and only if, it yields the best resolution of disputes.[32]\nWe saw that the strongest candidate for what legal interpretation seeks is provisions\u2019 contribution to the content of the law. (As noted, even if legal interpretation seeks the best resolution of disputes, legal interpretation must begin by seeking provisions\u2019 contributions, given plausible assumptions. See section 2.) If that is what legal interpretation seeks, then a method cannot be a good one unless it reliably yields the content of the law.\nLet\u2019s use the term legal facts for facts about the content of the law, for example, the fact that, in California, contracts for the sale of land are not valid unless in writing.[33] Legal facts are not among the most basic facts of the universe. They are determined by metaphysically more basic facts, such as facts about what various people and institutions have said and done and decided and, on some views, moral or other normative facts. A theory of law is an account of how the more basic, determining facts determine the legal facts.[34] Different theories of law make different claims about what the determining facts are and how they combine to determine the legal facts.\nThe most widely held theory of law, at least in law schools, is HLA Hart\u2019s (1994) inclusive positivist theory, and many theorists of legal interpretation profess to accept Hartian positivism (Alexander 2015; Baude and Sachs 2018; Baude 2015, 2364\u201365; Sachs 2014, 2261; 2015, 825\u201326; Fallon 2018, 90\u201391; Goldsworthy 2019). What are its implications for legal interpretation? On Hart\u2019s account, the content of the law is determined at the most fundamental level by the convergent practices of judges and other officials.[35] In Hart\u2019s well-known terminology, judges\u2019 convergent practices and attitudes constitute a rule of recognition that specifies how the content of the law is determined (Hart 1994, 100\u201310).[36] (For simplicity, I restrict attention to judges.) To illustrate with respect to statutes, if judges (in a particular jurisdiction): (1) regularly treat statutes as contributing to the law in a particular way; (2) are disposed to criticize other judges who fail to do so (or threaten to fail to do so); and (3) regard such criticisms as justified, then the rule of recognition in the jurisdiction is that statutes contribute to the content of the law in that way. (See entry on Legal Positivism.)\nIn addition to the rule of recognition\u2019s specification of how sources of law contribute to the content of the law at the most fundamental level, legal norms that are themselves validated by the rule of recognition could further specify how sources of law are to contribute to the content of the law.\nThus, if Hart\u2019s theory is true, in order to defend a preferred theory of legal interpretation, a theorist must argue either: 1) that the way in which the theory takes a provision to contribute to the content of the law is incorporated in the rule of recognition because it is treated as correct by a large majority of judges; or 2) that the way in which the theory takes a provision to contribute to the content of the law is validated by a criterion that, in turn, is treated as correct by a large majority of judges.[37] This would be a challenging task. (As these are the only two possibilities that Hart\u2019s account allows, to the extent that there is no consensus on a theory of legal interpretation and no criterion grounded in consensus that validates a particular theory of interpretation, it is indeterminate which theory of interpretation is correct.)[38]\nTake the first possibility. There seems to be no consensus among judges about the proper method of legal interpretation. Instead, there is widespread controversy (Hart and Sacks 1994, 1169; Eskridge 1994, 13\u201347; Eskridge, Frickey & Garret 2007, 689\u2013846; for a few haphazardly chosen examples, see the various methods employed and advocated in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Smith, Bond, Yates, Weber, and King v. Burwell). A theorist could try to argue that, at a high level of generality, there is a consensus among judges on the theorist\u2019s preferred method of interpretation, and that the disagreement is in the application of that consensus.\nThe only kind of consensus among judges, however, is on bland platitudes such as that original meaning matters or legislative intention is important. Such platitudes are too underspecified to yield a uniquely correct application. Which kind of original meaning? Semantic content? Communicative content? \u201cPublic meaning\u201d? Exactly how does original meaning matter, and what other factors matter and in what way? Which kind of legislative intention?\nThe second possibility is a little more promising. It is possible for judges to agree on a criterion (or chain of criteria) that validates a particular method of legal interpretation, yet be unaware that the criterion does so because the application of the criterion is controversial. Thus, for example, a theorist could try to argue that the judges agree on a normative criterion, but they disagree about what that criterion, properly understood, entails. Or a theorist could argue that judges converge on a descriptive criterion, but they have a factual disagreement about what that descriptive criterion entails. Perhaps there is a forgotten custom, validated by the rule of recognition, that specifies (when understood as the rule of recognition requires) that statutes contribute to the law according to their literal meaning, and there are no conflicting norms validated by the rule of recognition. Such possibilities can\u2019t be ruled out a priori, but it is clear that it would be a tall order to show that there is consensus on a criterion that, properly understood, yields a controversial method of interpretation.\nIn sum, on Hart\u2019s theory of law, it is difficult to defend any controversial theory of legal interpretation.[39] (But see Baude and Sachs 2017; 2018.)\nDworkin\u2019s well-known \u201claw as integrity\u201d theory of law, sketched above, is the most influential alternative to Hart\u2019s account. See section 3. (Dworkin 1986, 225, Ch. 7.) As discussed, Dworkin does not consider the distinction between theory of law and theory of legal interpretation \u2013 i.e., between an account of how the content of the law is determined and an account of how to ascertain the content of the law. He assumes that, if his theory of law is true, the proper method of legal interpretation is simply to seek the set of principles that best justify the legal practices.\nIn principle, however, a proponent of a different theory of legal interpretation, textualism, say, could argue that Dworkin\u2019s theory of law in fact supports textualism. The theorist would have to argue that textualism is the best method of ascertaining the set of principles that best justify the legal practices.\nIn light of these implications of well-known theories of law for how to defend theories of legal interpretation, it\u2019s worth returning to the kinds of arguments that theorists of legal interpretation in fact offer to support their preferred accounts. As already noted, normative arguments are probably the most common. The typical argument is that a method is supported by a certain value \u2013 democracy or fairness, for example \u2013 because the method treats sources of law as contributing to the law in the way that that value requires.\nIt may be that theorists give such arguments simply because they have not carefully considered what legal interpretation seeks. But are such arguments apt \u2013 that is, are they an appropriate way of defending a theory of legal interpretation given the assumption that legal interpretation seeks a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law?\nThe fact that a method of legal interpretation treats a provision as contributing to the law in the way that is supported by fairness (say) is an argument in favor of the correctness of that method only if fairness is relevant to the method\u2019s ability to identify a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law. But whether fairness is relevant in this way depends on how the content of the law is determined. Thus, whether typical normative arguments are apt depends on how the content of the law is determined. For example, if normative factors play no role in determining the content of the law, then it\u2019s hard to see how the fact that a method of interpretation treats a source as contributing to the law in a way that is fair bears on whether it accurately identifies a provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law.\nReturning to Hartian positivism, normative factors can play a role if, and only if, there is a consensus among judges that does the necessary work (or a consensus on another criterion that picks out those normative factors). If, as seems likely, there is no consensus among judges that does the necessary work, Hart\u2019s theory implies that normative factors do not play a role in determining the content of the law. In that case, the fact that a method of legal interpretation is supported by democracy, fairness, or other values has no bearing on whether it accurately ascertains the content of the law.\nExclusive positivist theories of law, by contrast with inclusive accounts like Hart\u2019s, maintain that normative factors can play no role in determining the content of the law at any level (Raz 1979; 1994; Shapiro 2011, 271\u201381; Leiter 1998, 535\u201336; see entry on Legal Positivism). On such accounts, it is clear that normative arguments have no bearing on whether a theory of interpretation is true.\nAs we saw above, Dworkin\u2019s theory makes normative arguments relevant. But the type of normative argument that it makes relevant is very different from the normative arguments typically offered in favor of theories of legal interpretation. On Dworkin\u2019s theory, the way to show that a method of interpretation accurately identifies how sources, such as statutory and constitutional provisions, contribute to the law is to show that the method yields the principles that best justify the enactment of those provisions. An argument that a method yields the best justification of enactments is, however, very different from the kind of normative argument typically offered in favor of theories of legal interpretation.\nOne theory of law \u2013 really a family of theories \u2013 offers a natural explanation of the relevance of the typical normative arguments. Theories in this family hold that legal obligations are constituted by certain genuine normative (or moral) obligations.[40] For example, according to the moral impact theory, the relevant obligations are, roughly speaking, those that obtain in virtue of the actions of legal institutions (Greenberg 2014). At the fundamental level, therefore, what the determinants of the content of the law are \u2013 and how they contribute to the content of the law \u2013 is determined by all relevant values. Thus, for example, a statute\u2019s contribution to the content of the law is the impact of its enactment, in light of fairness, democracy, and any other relevant values, on our obligations (and rights, permissions, powers, and so on). Consequently, on the moral impact theory, a natural way to argue for a method of interpretation is to argue that the way in which the method of interpretation takes sources to contribute to the content of the law is supported, on balance, by the relevant values.\nThe moral impact theory thus seems to fit nicely the way in which theorists of legal interpretation employ normative arguments to defend their theories (see Greenberg 2020, 133\u201334). And, perhaps surprisingly, on many competing theories of law, it may be difficult to defend the aptness of such normative arguments. Of course, the moral impact theory implies that it is not enough to argue, as theorists often do, that a particular democratic or fairness consideration supports a preferred theory of interpretation. What is needed is an argument that the way in which a theory takes sources to contribute to the content of the law is supported, on balance, by all relevant values.\n5.2 The Potential for Divergence between Theories of Law and Theories of Legal Interpretation\nIn the preceding subsection, I relied on the simplifying assumption that, if legal interpretation seeks the content of the law, then whether a method of legal interpretation is correct depends only on whether it treats the determinants of the content of the law as contributing to the content of the law in the way that they in fact do so. On this assumption, there is no gap between a theory of law and a theory of legal interpretation. If the correct theory of law is that the content of the law is determined by, say, the semantic content of the authoritative legal texts, then the best method of legal interpretation is to ascertain the semantic content of the authoritative legal texts.\nDepending on how we understand the province of a theory of legal interpretation, it may be important to qualify this straightforward approach in several ways. (See Greenberg 2020, 136\u2013141 for fuller discussion.) To begin with, legal interpretation is sensitive to evidentiary considerations in a way that the theory of law is not. Thus, a theory of legal interpretation may provide guidance as to what kinds of evidence are most reliable. Differently, there may be legal or moral reasons \u2013 as opposed to reasons of accuracy \u2013 not to permit consulting certain kinds of evidence. For example, it is plausible that, for reasons of democracy and fairness, private diaries of legislators are not appropriate kinds of evidence, even if consulting them would yield more accurate conclusions about the content of the law.\nMore generally, the theory of legal interpretation may take into account goals other than accurately identifying a provision\u2019s contribution. For example, it is often suggested that courts should adhere to the plain meaning of a provision in order to provide an incentive for good drafting. Improving the drafting of statutory and other provisions may in the long run help legal interpreters to identify provisions\u2019 contributions accurately as well as providing other benefits. In the short run, however, the goal of improving the drafting of legal texts may conflict with the goal of accurately identifying a provision\u2019s contribution. There is an important question to what extent it is appropriate for legal interpretation to pursue the former goal at the expense of the latter. To take a very different kind of example, there may be moral reasons why some kinds of mistakes are worse than others (or why mistakes by certain decision-makers are worse than mistakes by others). Such reasons may support following methods that would minimize the more problematic kinds of mistakes at the expense of overall accuracy.\nAnother important departure from the straightforward assumption that the correct theory of legal interpretation simply tracks the true theory of law would take into account the abilities and limitations of legal interpreters. Consideration of bounded rationality raises important issues for a theory of legal interpretation. Judges, to take an especially important group, operate with limited time and information and they are subject to human cognitive limitations and biases much discussed in recent literature. See entry on Bounded Rationality. Given these facts, it might be counterproductive for judges to directly aim to treat legal sources as contributing to the law in the way that they in fact contribute. They might do better overall at accurately identifying the way in which sources contribute to the content of the law if they instead followed some kind of relatively simple rule of thumb.[41] Similarly, we might also have special accounts for other participants in the legal system, for example, for legislators, executive officials, and police officers.\nIt could be debated whether taking into account agents\u2019 abilities and limitations properly belongs in the theory of legal interpretation. It might be, for example, that the proper place to take into account judges\u2019 biases and limitations is the theory of adjudication. Let\u2019s set aside this largely terminological question. Instead, we can distinguish between different degrees and kinds of idealization in the theory of legal interpretation. For example, one type of highly idealized theory asks how a legal interpreter without cognitive or time limitations best ascertains what the law is given the legally and morally permissible evidence (without taking into account values other than accuracy, except for the restriction to permissible evidence). A somewhat less idealized kind of theory asks how agents with specific abilities and limitations would, under real-world conditions, including limited time, do best at accurately identifying provisions\u2019 contributions. Finally, we could ask how a legal interpreter should proceed taking into account not just accuracy, but also the kinds of values illustrated above, such as promoting good drafting.\n6. Conclusion\nSeveral competing approaches to legal interpretation, such as intentionalism and textualism, are familiar to lawyers and legal theorists. Despite a large literature, there is a great deal of unclarity about what these approaches amount to \u2013 that is, about precisely which methods they recommend. Understanding can be greatly improved by attention to how language and meaning work and by explication of important distinctions, such as those between different types of intentions.\nBut there is a more fundamental question that has to be addressed in order to make progress on the question of which method of legal interpretation is correct. The question is what legal interpretation, by its nature, seeks. Although this question is not often explicitly addressed, several different candidates can be found in the literature. We assessed these candidates and saw that there is a powerful case that legal interpretation seeks provisions\u2019 contribution to the law.\nGiven this conclusion, which method of interpretation is correct will depend on how the content of the law is determined. On Hart\u2019s theory of law and other influential accounts, many familiar arguments deployed to defend methods of interpretation are not even of the appropriate sort.\nAlthough attention to the theory of law is critical to progress in the field of legal interpretation, there is space between the theory of legal interpretation and the theory of law. The theory of legal interpretation may take into account values other than accurately identifying the content of the law. And there is also the possibility that legal interpreters will more accurately identify the content of the law by following relatively simple rules of thumb than by trying to identify the content of the law directly.",
