    "main_text": "Generics and Logical Form || Characterizing Generics and Direct Kind Predications\n1.4 Characterizing Generics and Direct Kind Predications\n\nIt is helpful to separate out two categories of generic statements.\nOur first category includes statements such as \u201ctigers are\nstriped\u201d, \u201cravens are black\u201d, \u201ca lion has a\nmane\u201d, and \u201cthe leopard has spots\u201d. These statements\nare naturally thought of as expressing generalizations about\nindividual members of the kind. For example, we might suppose that\n\u201ctigers are striped\u201d is made true by enough individual\ntigers possessing stripes. The exact nature of these generalizations\nis highly controversial.\n\nIn our second category, we have statements like \u201cdinosaurs are\nextinct\u201d, \u201cthe dodo is extinct\u201d, \u201ctigers are\nwidespread\u201d, and \u201cthe domestic cat is common\u201d, which\nare often thought to predicate a property directly of the kind in\nquestion, rather than expressing generalizations concerning its\nmembers. For example, in saying \u201cdinosaurs are extinct\u201d,\none says something about the kind dinosaur, namely that that\nkind of thing is extinct. We may notice that it is not possible to say\nof an individual dinosaur, Dino, that Dino is extinct, since only a\nkind can be extinct. Thus, for these generics, Carlson\u2019s\noriginal idea\u2014that bare plurals can refer directly to kinds, and\nthus that (at least some) generics involve predicating properties\ndirectly of kinds\u2014remains widely accepted.\n\nExamples of this second category are often referred to as\n\u201cdirect kind predications\u201d while examples of the first are\nknown as \u201ccharacterizing generics\u201d. (Direct kind\npredications are also known as D-generics (\u201cD\u201d for\n\u201cdefinite\u201d); characterizing generics are also known as\nI-generics (\u201cI\u201d for \u201cindefinite\u201d) (Krifka\n1987).) It should be noted that the indefinite singular form on its\nstandard interpretation cannot be used to express a direct kind\npredication: statements such as \u201ca dinosaur is extinct\u201d\nand \u201ca tiger is widespread\u201d are not felicitous. (They can\nof course be heard as felicitous if they are given a very different\ninterpretation, so that their domain ranges over particular\nkinds\u2014e.g., \u201ca dinosaur, namely the T. rex, is\nextinct\u201d\u2014but this is not the relevant interpretation. To\nsee the difference, consider statements involving kinds that do not\nthemselves have salient subkinds, e.g., perhaps \u201ca T.\nrex is extinct\u201d.)\n\nMuch of the work on the semantics of generics has been focused on\ncharacterizing generics, since they have proved the most elusive. It\nis widely accepted that sentences like \u201cdinosaurs are\nextinct\u201d, \u201cthe dodo is extinct\u201d, and \u201ctigers\nare widespread\u201d are singular statements that predicate\nproperties directly of kinds. For example, \u201ctigers are\nextinct\u201d predicates the property of being extinct\ndirectly of the kind Panthera tigris, and would be true just\nin case Panthera tigris had the property of being extinct\n(Krifka et al. 1995). The semantics of characterizing generics have\nproved much less tractable.\n",
