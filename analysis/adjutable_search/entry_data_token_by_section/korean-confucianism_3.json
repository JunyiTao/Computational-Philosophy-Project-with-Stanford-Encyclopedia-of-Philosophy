    "main_text": "Korea\u2019s Neo-Confucian Confrontation with Buddhism || Early Criticisms of Buddhism\n3.1 Early Criticisms of Buddhism\n\nOne of the first Confucian texts critical of the Buddhists was that of\nPaek Munbo (1303\u20131374), Ch\u2019\u014fkpulso\n(\u65a5\u4f5b\u758f) [In Rejection of Buddhism], which\nused Shao Yong\u2019s Daoist-inspired cyclical cosmological\nphilosophy to ratiocinate that it was again time for restoration of\nthe \u201cway\u201d of the sage Confucian rulers Yao and Shun\n(Deuchler 1992: 23). Kang (2003 [2006: 158\u2013164]) outlines the\nopposition to Buddhism towards the end of the Kory\u014f period,\nespecially among Confucian scholars such as Ch\u014fng Mongju\n(1337\u20131392) and Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn. Ch\u014fng Mongju\nemphasised the practical \u201ceveryday life\u201d of the Confucians\nwho fulfilled social and sexual relations unlike the Buddhists who\n\n\npart with relatives, denounce the relationship between man and woman\n[\u2026] and revere the search for emptiness and Nirvana. (Kang 2003\n[2006: 160\u2013161])\n\n\nHe also was noted for his loyalty to last king of the Kory\u014f,\nwhich would cost him his life: this was how seriously Confucian\nphilosophers were dedicated to the moral principles they wrote\nabout\u2014ideas they were expected to practice in their lives. It\nwas Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn, the \u201cgodfather\u201d of early\nChos\u014fn Neo-Confucianism, who had helped General Yi S\u014fnggye\n(1335\u20131408) to form a military alliance with other powerful\nNeo-Confucian scholars following Yi\u2019s decision to oust the last\nKory\u014f king from power in 1388, soon establishing the Chos\u014fn\ndynasty. Neo-Confucianism became the guiding socio-political ideology\nof Chos\u014fn with Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn at the helm as its chief\narchitect, benefiting from military support and royal authority to\ncarry out his grand scheme (E. Chung 1995: 59). From the point of view\nof intellectual history, Ch\u014fng played a major role in the attempt\nto discredit and marginalise Buddhism, and Kw\u014fn K\u016dn (quoted\nin Deuchler 1992: 101 [Sambong-jib: 286]), commented on how\nCh\u014fng aspired to make\n\n\nthe elucidation of the Learning of the Way [Neo-Confucianism] and the\nrepulsion of heterodox teachings [i.e., Buddhism] his own\nresponsibility.\n\n\nConfucian philosophy was then used to undermine Buddhism during this\nearly stage of its development in Korea.\n",
