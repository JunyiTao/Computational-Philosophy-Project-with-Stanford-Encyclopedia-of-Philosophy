    "main_text": "Speculative Physics || Three Categories of Change\n3.3 Three Categories of Change\n\nChapter VI (De tribus praedicamentis) of the Regulae\ndeals with motion in three categories: place, quantity, and quality.\nThe first part (de motu locali) deals with the speed or\nslowness of uniformly or difformly accelerated and decelerated motion\nconsidered in its kinematical aspect. The second part (de\nvelocitate motus augmentationis) deals with augmentation\nunderstood as pure increase in size, and more specifically with the\nspeed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced, i.e., by\nspace traversed in time. The third part (de velocitate motus\nalterationis) is concentrated on mathematical description of\nvariation of intensity in space and time. The prime purpose to be\nachieved in this chapter is to establish definitions of speed in the\nthree categories of motion. All debated cases are posed secundum\nimaginationem.\n3.3.1 Local Motion\n\nAccording to Heytesbury\u2019s own words: \u201clocal motion by\nnature precedes other kinds [of change] just as the first\u201d\n(De motu locali [DML] 2020: \u00a7 2, 270). He focuses on the\npossible measure of the speed of these changes by the effect produced\n(i.e., the space traversed) during an equal length of time.\nConsequently, he is interested in the kinematic aspect of motion (DML\n2020: \u00a7 63,\n 296).[42]\n Local motions are grouped into two classes: uniform and difform. A\nuniform motion is motion in which equal spaces are traversed\ncontinually in equal parts of time . Difform motions can vary in\ninfinite ways, both with respect to the magnitude or the subject\nmoved, and with respect to time (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 3\u20135,\n270). Difform motion with respect to the subject moved is motion in\nwhich different points of the body move with unequal speeds; for\ninstance, a rolling wheel moves with difform motion since different\npoints on the wheel vary in regard to distance from the axis of\nrotation (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 9\u201316, 271\u2013273). Difform\nmotion with respect to time is motion in which unequal spaces are\ntraversed in equal times. Motion can also be difform with respect to\nboth time and the subject moved (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 17\u201320,\n273\u2013274). Difform motions are subdivided into two classes: the\nuniformly difform (uniformiter difformis) motion and the\ndifformly difform (difformiter difformis) motion (DML 2020:\n\u00a7 21, 275). Uniformly difform motion is motion in which the speed\neither increases or decreases uniformly, that is, a motion in which in\nany equal parts of time, equal latitudes of speed are either acquired\nor lost (DML 2020: \u00a7 22, 275). A difformly difform motion is\nmotion in which a greater latitude of velocity is gained or lost in\none part of time than in another equal to it (DML 2020: \u00a7 40,\n284).\n\nThe most gripping example of uniformly difform motion is accelerated\nmotion, like a motion of a body moving towards the Earth. Heytesbury\ngives a general rule, called the Middle Degree Theorem, by which we\nmay calculate the distance traversed from the latitude of speed\nuniformly acquired. He makes use of this theorem with respect to both\naccelerated and decelerated motions. In his own formulation it reads\nas follows:\n\n\nCertainly, every latitude [of speed] that is acquired or lost\nuniformly, whether commencing at a non-degree or at any degree, as\nlong as it is limited to some finite degree, corresponds precisely to\nits own middle degree in such a way that a moving body that uniformly\nacquires or loses its speed in any given time traverses the distance\nperfectly equal to the one it would traverse during the same time when\nmoving with [a speed corresponding to] this middle\n degree.[43]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 26, 276; see also Wilson 1960: 122\u201323)\n\n\nAccording to this rule, the distance traversed by a uniformly\naccelerated body in a given time is equal to the distance which would\nbe traversed in the same time in a uniform motion with its middle\ndegree of speed (half of the sum of the initial and final speed). A\nnumber of conclusions follow from this theorem:\n\nSince the medium degree of\u00a0uniformly acquired latitude of\nspeed\u00a0[in uniformly difform motion] which commences at no-degree\nand ends at some finite degree is precisely half the degree of that\nterminating the motion, it follows that a body which moves with a\nuniformly difform motion commencing at no-degree and terminating at\nsome finite degree [of speed] traverses less than half [the distance]\nwhich would be traversed by a body moving uniformly during the same\ntime with a speed equal to a given degree terminating the\n motion.[44]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 27, 272; see also Wilson 1960: 123)\n[Given that] the medium degree of uniformly difform latitude of\nspeed which commences at some degree and ends at another is greater\nthan half the degree terminating the latitude of its more intense\nextreme, it follows that a body which moves with uniformly difform\nmotion commencing at some degree of speed and terminating at another\ntraverses more than half the distance which would be traversed by a\nbody moving uniformly during the same time with a speed equal to the\nmost intense speed in the uniformly difform\n motion.[45]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 28, 272; see also Wilson 1960: 123)\nIn a uniformly difform motion commencing with no-degree speed and\nending with some finite degree, the distance traversed in the first\nhalf of the time is one third of that traversed in the second half.\nAnd conversely, in a motion in which the speed decreases uniformly\nfrom some degree to no-degree the distance traversed in the first half\nof the time is three times that traversed in the second\n half.[46]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 35, 276; see Wilson 1960: 124).\n\n\nBy the end of the chapter, Heytesbury states that an infinite number\nof sophisms can be made concerning speed in local motion, as well as\nthe intension and remission of such speed (DML 2020: \u00a7 61,\n 294).[47]\n3.3.2 Alteration\n\nIn the subsequent chapter dealing with qualitative changes, Heytesbury\nexpresses the same concerns. He takes part in the debate over one of\nthe most widely discussed problems in the fourteenth-century\nphilosophy of nature focused on the possible \u201cmeasure\u201d of\nthe intension and remission of forms. Like most of the Oxford\nCalculators, Heytesbury accepts Scotus\u2019s and Ockham\u2019s\naddition theory and assumes that the intension of form is the result\nof adding qualitative parts. As an Ockhamist, Heytesbury emphasizes\nthat the term \u201cmotion\u201d in alteration connotes nothing else\nthan the degrees or latitude of quality that are successively\nacquired. A basic assumption is that qualitative intensity is a\ncertain kind of linearly ordered and additive quantity. Thus, as in\nthe case of local motion, Heytesbury divides the latitudes of motion\nof alteration into the latitude of motion of intension and the\nlatitude of motion of remission; and the latitude of the latitude of\nmotion into the latitude of the acquisition of the latitude of motion\nand the latitude of the loss of latitude of motion. In modern\nterminology, these latitudes correspond to latitudes of speed and of\nacceleration and deceleration, respectively. Since there is no limit\nto speeds of alteration nor to rates of acceleration or deceleration\nof that speed, those latitudes are all infinite.\n\nHeytesbury presents three different ways of \u201cmeasuring\u201d\nthe speed of alteration in which the intensity of a quality varies\nform one point to another, or from instant to instant of time, or from\npoint to point of the moving body: (1) by the degree (gradus)\ninduced (a subject is considered to be altered faster when a higher\ndegree is induced); (2) by the latitude of form acquired in comparison\nto the size of the subject (the speed of alteration is proportionally\ngreater in a larger body); and (3) by the latitude acquired in a given\ntime, regardless of the size of the subject undergoing alteration.\nHeytesbury holds the third position and claims that as in the case of\nlocal motion, the speed of alteration is to be measured at the point\nof the body where the rate of change is most rapid, that is, where the\nmaximum latitude of form is acquired ([RSS] 1494: fol. 51ra).\n3.3.3 Augmentation\n\nHeytesbury deals with augmentation as with pure increase in size,\nwhich is the same process as rarefaction; more precisely, he deals\nwith the speed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced.\nThere are three ways of \u201cmeasuring\u201d the speed of\naugmentation acquired in time: (1) by the maximum quantity acquired;\n(2) by the latitude of rarity or rareness; and (3) by the ratio of new\nsize to previous size ([RSS] 1494: fol. 60rb). He holds the third\nposition, according to which the ratios correspond to different\ndegrees of augmentation. Augmentation, like the two other motions, can\nbe uniform or difform. An augmentation is uniform if in equal\nintervals of time, the body undergoing augmentation increases in size\nby the same ratio. While discussing the above mentioned positions,\nHeytesbury makes broad use of the new calculus of ratios invented by\nKilvington and Bradwardine.\n4. Influence\n\nAs a logician, Heytesbury strongly influenced logic in fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century Britain, and there is a notable fifteenth and early\nsixteenth-century reception in Italy where multiple editions of his\ncommentaries on [RSS] and [SCD] were printed (Ashworth & Spade\n1992; de Rijk 1975, 1977). Despite his dismissive attitude toward this\ngenre, Heytesbury\u2019s treatise is one of the most influential late\nmedieval texts. These influences include the British logical tradition\n(see Pironet 2008), the Italian logical\n tradition,[48]\n and John Mair\u2019s\n circle,[49]\n and the treatise is referred to even as late as 1688 (De Benedictis\n1688: 580\u2013590; for other influence, see Spade 1989: 273).\nHeytesbury\u2019s catalogue of solutions to the paradoxes, where the\npositions are (correctly or not) attributed to fourteenth-century\nBritish logicians, is further developed and sometimes defended against\nHeytesbury\u2019s harsh and sarcastic dismissal. (R2.2) is developed\nby extending the proof and supplemented by saying that paradoxical\nsentences (or all sentences, for that matter) signify their own truth.\nFurthermore, Heytesbury\u2019s contribution to epistemic logic in the\nsecond chapter of [RSS] appears to have sparked further debate in the\nupcoming centuries, as documented by the fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century development of the British and Italian treatises\nde scire et dubitare which typically revolved around the\nsophisms formulated by Heytesbury and where Heytesbury\u2019s\nposition was among those which were discussed, sometimes with an\nexplicit attribution to Heytesbury (Boh 1993 and Hanke 2018a and\n2018b). As a philosopher, Heytesbury significantly influenced later\nOxford Calculators: John Dumbleton, anonymous author of the\nTractatus de sex inconvenientibus, Richard Swineshead, author\nof one of the most famous treatises Liber Calculationum, and\ncontinental fourteenth and fifteenth-century philosophers, e.g., John\nCasali, John of Holland, Petrus of Mantua, Cajetan of Thiene, Giovanni\nMarliani, and Paul of Venice (see Wilson 1956: 25\u201328, Rommevaux\n2017: 154\u2013160, Jung, Podko\u0144ski 2020: 130\u201331,\n148\u2013149, 151). The Middle Degree Theorem was widely discussed\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and later played an\nimportant role in the formulation of the law of free fall (see Damerow\net al. 1992: 161\u2013200, esp. 232\u2013236).",
