    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cOld\u201d Metaphysics || Being As Such, First Causes, Unchanging Things\n2.1 Being As Such, First Causes, Unchanging Things\n\nIf metaphysics now considers a wider range of problems than those\nstudied in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, those original\nproblems continue to belong to its subject-matter. For instance, the\ntopic of \u201cbeing as such\u201d (and \u201cexistence as\nsuch\u201d, if existence is something other than being) is one of the\nmatters that belong to metaphysics on any conception of metaphysics.\nThe following theses are all paradigmatically metaphysical:\n\n\u201cBeing is; not-being is not\u201d [Parmenides];\n\u201cEssence precedes existence\u201d [Avicenna,\nparaphrased];\n\u201cExistence in reality is greater than existence in the\nunderstanding alone\u201d [St Anselm, paraphrased];\n\u201cExistence is a perfection\u201d [Descartes,\nparaphrased];\n\u201cBeing is a logical, not a real predicate\u201d [Kant,\nparaphrased];\n\u201cBeing is the most barren and abstract of all\ncategories\u201d [Hegel, paraphrased];\n\u201cAffirmation of existence is in fact nothing but denial of\nthe number zero\u201d [Frege];\n\u201cUniversals do not exist but rather subsist or have\nbeing\u201d [Russell, paraphrased];\n\u201cTo be is to be the value of a bound variable\u201d\n[Quine].\n\u201cAn object\u2019s degree of being is proportionate to the\nnaturalness of its mode of existence\u201d [McDaniel].\n\n\nIt seems reasonable, moreover, to say that investigations into\nnon-being belong to the topic \u201cbeing as such\u201d and thus\nbelong to metaphysics. (This did not seem reasonable to Meinong, who\nwished to confine the subject-matter of metaphysics to \u201cthe\nactual\u201d and who therefore did not regard his Theory of Objects\nas a metaphysical theory. According to the conception of metaphysics\nadopted in this article, however, his thesis [paraphrased]\n\u201cPredication is independent of being\u201d is paradigmatically\nmetaphysical.)\n\nThe topics \u201cthe first causes of things\u201d and\n\u201cunchanging things\u201d\u2014have continued to interest\nmetaphysicians, though they are not now seen as having any important\nconnection with the topic \u201cbeing as such\u201d. The first three\nof Aquinas\u2019s Five Ways are metaphysical arguments on any\nconception of metaphysics. Additionally the thesis that there are no\nfirst causes and the thesis that there are no things that do not\nchange count as metaphysical theses, for in the current conception of\nmetaphysics, the denial of a metaphysical thesis is a metaphysical\nthesis. No post-Medieval philosopher would say anything like this:\n\n\nI study the first causes of things, and am therefore a metaphysician.\nMy colleague Dr McZed denies that there are any first causes and is\ntherefore not a metaphysician; she is rather, an anti-metaphysician.\nIn her view, metaphysics is a science with a non-existent\nsubject-matter, like astrology.\n\n\nThis feature of the contemporary conception of metaphysics is nicely\nillustrated by a statement of Sartre\u2019s:\n\n\nI do not think myself any less a metaphysician in denying the\nexistence of God than Leibniz was in affirming it. (1949: 139)\n\n\nAn anti-metaphysician in the contemporary sense is not a philosopher\nwho denies that there are objects of the sorts that an earlier\nphilosopher might have said formed the subject-matter of metaphysics\n(first causes, things that do not change, universals, substances,\n\u2026), but rather a philosopher who denies the legitimacy of the\nquestion whether there are objects of those sorts.\n\nThe three original topics\u2014the nature of being; the first causes\nof things; things that do not change\u2014remained topics of\ninvestigation by metaphysicians after Aristotle. Another topic,\ndiscussed in the following subsection, occupies an intermediate\nposition between Aristotle and his successors.\n",
