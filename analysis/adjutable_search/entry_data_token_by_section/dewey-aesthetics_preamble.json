    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Dewey is, with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, one of\nthe leading early figures of the school of American Pragmatists. He\nhas also had a great deal of influence in aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of art. His work Art as Experience (1934) is\nregarded by many as one of the most important contributions to this\narea in the twentieth century. The work is especially well-known for\nits full-blown treatment of aesthetic experience.\n\nCritical of attempts to limit aesthetic experience solely to the\ndomain of fine art, Art as Experience has had a high\ninfluence on trends in aesthetic research, which have sought to\nbroaden the scope of the field from the traditional arts to popular\nculture (Shusterman 1992, 2nd edition 2000), the natural\nenvironment (Berleant 1997), and the everyday (Kupfer 1983, Saito\n2007, Stroud 2011, Leddy 2012). The work is also often seen as a key\npart of Dewey\u2019s general late philosophical project, most\nsystematically developed in Experience and Nature (1925), of\nrethinking experience along naturalist lines as an interaction between\nthe organism and its environment as opposed to a discrete sensory unit\nsuch as stimulus, impression, idea, or sense-datum. Instead of\ninvestigating how our senses are in touch with reality and whether\nthey represent it correctly\u2014which Dewey takes to be the frame of\nmodern epistemology\u2014Dewey\u2019s starting point, building on\nhis reading of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, is to look at the\nways in which experience is formed as a part of natural processes to\nwhich the human being is fundamentally tied. For Dewey, aesthetic\nexperience is the highest form of this interaction. It is the phase\nwhen, in Dewey\u2019s often used words, the interaction between the\norganism and the environment reaches a stage of fulfillment. Already\nExperience and Nature includes a chapter on aesthetics the\nthemes of which Dewey went on to develop in much greater depth and\ndetail in Art as Experience some ten years later. Due to the\nhigh value that Dewey places on aesthetic experience, Art as\nExperience has even been regarded as the culminating work of\nDewey\u2019s late philosophical thinking (Alexander 2013).\n",
