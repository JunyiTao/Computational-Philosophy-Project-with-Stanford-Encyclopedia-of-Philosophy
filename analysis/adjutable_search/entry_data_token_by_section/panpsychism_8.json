    "main_text": "Arguments for Panpsychism || Other Arguments for Panpsychism\n3.3 Other Arguments for Panpsychism\nWhereas the anti-emergence argument discussed above tries to show that panpsychism offers the best account of the synchronic dependence of biological consciousness on more fundamental features of reality, genetic arguments try to show that panpsychism offers the best account of the development of biological consciousness in evolutionary history.[22] Such arguments turn on the assumption that evolution is a continuous process that molds pre-existing properties into more complex forms, but that cannot produce \u201centirely novel\u201d properties. William Clifford puts the argument thus:\n\n\u2026 we cannot suppose that so enormous a jump from one creature to another should have occurred at any point in the process of evolution as the introduction of a fact entirely different and absolutely separate from the physical fact. It is impossible for anybody to point out the particular place in the line of descent where that event can be supposed to have taken place. The only thing that we can come to, if we accept the doctrine of evolution at all, is that even in the very lowest organism, even in the Amoeba which swims about in our own blood, there is something or other, inconceivably simple to us, which is of the same nature with our own consciousness\u2026. (Clifford [1874] 1886: 266)\n\nA similar argument is due to James:\n\nwe ought \u2026 to try every possible mode of conceiving of consciousness so that it may not appear equivalent to the irruption into the universe of a new nature non-existent to then. ([1890] 1950: 148)\n\nMore recently, Goff (2013) has argued that consciousness is not vague, and that this leads to a sorites-style argument for panpsychism. Very roughly if consciousness does not admit of borderline cases, then we will have to suppose that some utterly precise micro-level change\u2014down to an exact arrangement of particles\u2014marked the first appearance of consciousness (or the change from non-conscious to conscious embryo/foetus), and it is going to seem arbitrary that it was that utterly precise change that was responsible for this significant change in nature. Influential materialist Michael Tye (2021) converted to a form of panprotopsychism on similar grounds, arguing that \u2018a key element of consciousness itself was always here, as a fundamental feature of micro-reality.\u2019\nAnother recent motivation for panpsychism comes from the need to account for mental causation in a way that is consistent with alleged causal closure of the physical: the thesis that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause (Chalmers 2015; Goff 2017: ch. 6). If, as the dualist believes, consciousness exists outside the physical world, it is hard to see how it could impact on a causally closed physical system. But if, as the panpsychist believes, consciousness infuses the intrinsic nature of the material world, then consciousness and its effects are part of the causally closed system. As discussed above, this is an important motivation for the contemporary position Russellian monism.\nFinally, Hedda Hassel M\u00f8rch (2020a,b) has identified and reformulated an argument for panpsychism from the experience of causation. Hume famously argued that we do not experience the necessary connection between cause and effect. M\u00f8rch argues, contra Hume, that attention to experience does reveal a necessary connection between mental events of feeling pain and of trying to avoid, and uses this as the basis for an argument to panpsychism. William James (1911: 218) gives the gist of the argument as follows \u2018\u2026 the concrete perceptual flux, taken just as it comes, offers in our own activity-situations perfectly comprehensible instances of causal agency \u2026 If we took these experiences as the type of what actual causation is, we should have to ascribe to cases of causation outside of our life, to physical cases also, an inwardly experiential nature. In other words, we should have to espouse a so-called \u201cpan-psychic\u201d philosophy.\u2019 More generally M\u00f8rch (2020a,b,c) is a leading advocate of the \u2018phenomenal powers view\u2019, according to which conscious states necessitate their effects in virtue of how they feel.\n",
