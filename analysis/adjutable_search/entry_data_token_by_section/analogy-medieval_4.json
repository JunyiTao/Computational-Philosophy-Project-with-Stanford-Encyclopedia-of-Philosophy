    "main_text": "Divisions of Analogy\n5. Divisions of Analogy\n\nBoethius\u2019s subdivisions had one major failure: they did not seem\nto accommodate the different uses of the word \u2018being\u2019\n(ens). As a result, many authors used a new threefold\ndivision which included Boethius\u2019s last two subdivisions and one\nmore. They presented the division as a division of deliberate\nequivocals, and they identified deliberate equivocals with analogical\nterms. This threefold division of analogy was established in the\nthirteenth century, in response to a remark by Averroes in his\ncommentary on the Metaphysics to the effect that Aristotle\nhad classified \u2018healthy\u2019 as a case of relationship to one\nthing as an end, \u2018medical\u2019 as a case of relationship to\none thing as an agent, and \u2018being\u2019 (ens) as a\ncase of relationship to one subject. It is found in Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s own commentary on the Metaphysics, as well as\nin his fifteenth-century follower Capreolus. An analogical term is now\nseen as one which is said of two things in a prior and a posterior\nsense, and it is grounded in various kinds of attribution or\nrelationship to the primary object: food is healthy as a cause of a\nhealthy animal, a procedure is medical when applied by a medical\nagent, a quality has being by virtue of the existent substance that it\ncharacterizes.\n\nA second threefold division of analogy arose from reflection on the\nrelationship between equivocal and analogical terms. Analogical terms\nwere said to be intermediaries between equivocal and univocal terms,\nand the standard view was that analogical terms were intermediary\nbetween chance equivocals and univocals, and hence that they were to\nbe identified with deliberate equivocals. The notion of an\nintermediary term, however, is open to more than one interpretation,\nand some authors went further in suggesting that at least some\nanalogical terms were intermediary between univocals and deliberate\nequivocals, so that they were not equivocal in any of the normal\nsenses at all. Towards the end of the thirteenth century, an anonymous\ncommentator on the Sophistical Refutations gives the\nfollowing classification. First, there are analogical terms which are\nunivocal in a broad sense of \u2018univocal\u2019. Here reference\nwas made to genus terms such as \u2018animal\u2019. Human beings and\ndonkeys participate equally in the common nature animal, but are not\nthemselves equal, since human beings are more perfect than donkeys.\nThis type of analogy was routinely discussed in response to a remark\nAristotle had made in Physics VII (249a22\u201325) which, in\nLatin translation, asserted that many equivocations are hidden in a\ngenus. Medieval logicians felt obliged to fit this claim into the\nframework of equivocation and analogy, even if the consensus was that\nin the end the use of genus terms was univocal. Second, there are\nthose analogical terms such as \u2018being\u2019 (ens)\nwhich are not equivocal, because only one concept or nature\n(ratio) seems to be involved, and which are not univocal\neither, because things participate this one ratio unequally,\nin a prior and a posterior way. It is these terms which are the\ngenuine intermediaries. Third, there are those analogical terms which\nare deliberate equivocals, because there are two concepts or natures\n(rationes) which are participated in a prior and a posterior\nway. The example here was \u2018healthy\u2019. This second threefold\ndivision was much discussed. Duns Scotus bitterly criticized it in his\nearlier logical writings. Walter Burley claimed that both the first\nand the second kinds of analogical term could properly be regarded as\nunivocal in a wide sense. The division was popular in the fifteenth\ncentury with such Thomists as Capreolus, who realized its closeness to\nthe account given by Aquinas in his Sentences commentary.\n",
