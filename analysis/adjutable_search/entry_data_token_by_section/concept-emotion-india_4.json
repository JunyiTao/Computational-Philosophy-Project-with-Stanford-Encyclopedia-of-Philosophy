    "main_text": "The Buddhist account of the emotions || Buddhist cognition\n4.1 Buddhist cognition\n\nAs with other Indian accounts of the emotions, the Buddhist conception\nof emotion appears in the context of the discussion about the role of\ncognition (vij\u00f1\u0101na). Buddhist philosophers argue\nagainst the existence of a self (\u0101tman). At the same\ntime, they acknowledge the existence of a non-physical momentary\nconsciousness or chain of cognitions (sant\u0101na\nvij\u00f1\u0101na) which carries over from former births into\nthe present and future rebirths. Thus, Buddhists try to find a middle\nground between a permanent non-physical self and the materialism of\nthe Lok\u0101yata school (materialist school of philosophy) which\nargues that the self is purely the result of bodily processes.\nAccording to the materialists, the self comes into existence with the\nbody and ceases to exist when the body ceases to exist.\n\nIn the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-siddhi-chapter of the\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika, Dharmak\u012brti argues\nthat past lives exist. We can know this because of the authority of\nthe Buddha and we have reason to accept his authority because of his\ninfinite compassion. This compassion can only be the result of\npractice over many life times [PV 36]. The Lok\u0101yata philosophers\nargue that cognitions require the support of a body and therefore\ncease to exist when the body ceases to exist. Dharmak\u012brti objects\nto this by arguing that mental cognitions do not derive from any\nphysical support [PV 49]. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla state that the relationship between the support\nand what is supported can be analyzed either as a causal relationship\nor as the relationship between an object and its capacity [TS and TSP\n1858\u20131859]. In this respect they do not deviate from\nDharmak\u012brti who rejects this position of the Lok\u0101yata\nphilosophers by arguing that the body could be neither the cause of\ncognition nor could it have the capacity of cognition. Franco explains\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s argument in the following way:\n\nIf the body were one lasting and changeless entity from birth to\ndeath, it could not produce cognitions gradually, and thus all the\ncognitions one has throughout one\u2019s life would be produced at\nonce. If the body were the material cause of the cognition, the\ncognition would last as long as the body, and thus there could be no\ndead body (v. 51). If the breaths are considered the cause of\ncognition, the same inadmissible consequence applies: Because the body\nis the material cause of the breaths, the breaths would last as long\nas the body and the cognition as long as the breaths (v. 53). All\nthese inadmissible consequences do not apply if one admits that\ncognition is the cause of cognition. (Franco 1997, pp. 134\u2013135)\n\n\nOf course, there is no reason why the Lok\u0101yata philosophers\nshould say that the body is changeless. It might precisely be the\nchanges that appear in the body, for example in the brain, which are\nresponsible for cognition. Dharmak\u012brti argues that if cognition\nrequired the support of the body, there is no reason why it should not\narise everywhere where there exists a body or matter [PV 37\u201338].\nThe obvious objection to this argument is that not any form of matter\nsupports cognition. It has to be a particular kind of matter, ordered\nin a particular way, as is the case in human beings and many\nanimals.\n\nAccording to Buddhist \u201cpsychology\u201d, love and hatred are\ntwo of the afflictions (kle\u015bas) that befall human beings\nand that need to be removed in order to attain liberation. There are a\nnumber of sections in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi,\npossibly written by either Asa\u1e45ga or Maitreya, that discuss\nthese kle\u015bas. The text provides several lists, most of\nwhich include love (r\u0101ga) and hatred or enmity\n(pratigha). Other kle\u015bas are:\nsatk\u0101ya-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di (false view with regard\nto the satk\u0101ya (five skandhas)), attachment to\nextreme views, attachment to unwholesome views, attachment to\npractices and observances, pride, ignorance and doubt. These\nkle\u015bas could be associated with one or more of the five\npossible feelings: pleasant feeling (sukha), unpleasant\nfeeling (du\u1e25kha), neutral feeling\n(upek\u1e63\u0101), happy mood (sau-manasya) or\nunhappy mood (daur-manasya). A translation of the\npsychological categories of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi\ninto the categories of Western philosophy of mind would render the\nfollowing distinctions: a kle\u015ba is a mental phenomenon\nthat consists of a representation of an object plus a certain feeling,\nsensation or affect. For example, in the case of love, the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi states that we have the object\nof love plus either a pleasant sensation or a happy mood or\nindifference (neutral feeling). It is interesting to note that the\nmental phenomenon of love can be connected with indifference. In\ngeneral, this suggests that a sensation is comparable to a\npsychological attitude and that we always have to have one attitude or\nanother towards a mental object. This means that our thinking is never\nwithout a feeling, even if it is a \u201cneutral\u201d feeling. It\nis unclear, however, in what way we could experience the emotion of\nlove with the sensation of indifference. It seems that love always\nrequires a positive feeling. The\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi allows for a mental phenomenon\nto count as the experience of love, as long as it does not involve a\n\u201cnegative\u201d, i.e., unhappy or unpleasant, feeling.\n\nIn addition, the text acknowledges that a representation can be about\na real object or an imagined object. In the latter case, the question\narises in what way we can distinguish between an object and its\nrepresentation. This suggests that at least some Buddhist traditions\ndistinguish between a cognition, the object of a cognition and the\nfeeling accompanying a cognition. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nmentions kle\u015bas in TS 1955 and it is obvious that he\noperates within the context of this psychological distinction which\nbecomes clear in his discussion of love (r\u0101ga) and\nhatred (dve\u1e63a).\n",
