    "main_text": "Work in the foundations and philosophy of mathematics || Weyl and Hilbert\n3.3 Weyl and Hilbert\n\n\nWeyl\u2019s espousal of the intuitionistic standpoint in the foundations \nof mathematics in 1920\u201321 inevitably led to friction with his \nold mentor Hilbert. Hilbert\u2019s conviction had long been that there \nwere in principle no limitations on the possibility of a full \nscientific understanding of the natural world, and, analogously, in \nthe case of mathematics, that once a problem was posed with the \nrequired precision, it was, at least in principle, soluble. In 1904 \nhe was moved to respond to Emil du Bois-Reymond\u2019s famous declaration \nconcerning the limits of science, ignoramus et ignorabimus (\u201cwe\nare ignorant and we shall remain ignorant\u201d):\n\nWe hear within us the perpetual call. There is the problem. Seek the\nsolution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is\nno\n ignorabimus.[24]\n\n\n\nHilbert was unalterably opposed to any restriction of mathematics \n\u201cby decree\u201d, an obstacle he had come up against in the \nearly stages of his career in the form of Leopold Kronecker\u2019s (the \ninfluential 19th century German mathematician) \nanathematization of all mathematics venturing beyond the finite. In \nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionistic program\u2014with its draconian \nrestrictions on what was admissible in mathematical argument, in \nparticular, its rejection of the law of excluded middle, \n\u201cpure\u201d existence proofs, and virtually the whole of \nCantorian set theory\u2014Hilbert saw the return of Kroneckerian \nconstaints on mathematics (and also, perhaps, a trace of du \nBois-Reymond\u2019s \u201cignorabimus\u201d) against which he had \nstruggled for so long. Small wonder, then, that Hilbert was upset \nwhen Weyl joined the Brouwerian \n camp.[25]\n\n\n\nHilbert\u2019s response was to develop an entirely new approach to the \nfoundations of mathematics with the ultimate goal of establishing \nbeyond doubt the consistency of the whole of classical mathematics, \nincluding arithmetic, analysis, and Cantorian set theory. With the \nattainment of that goal, classical mathematics would be placed \nsecurely beyond the destructive reach of the intuitionists. The core \nof Hilbert\u2019s program was the translation of the whole apparatus of \nclassical mathematical demonstration into a simple, finitistic \nframework (which he called \u201cmetamathematics\u201d) involving \nnothing more, in principle, than the straightforward manipulation of \nsymbols, taken in a purely formal sense, and devoid of further \n meaning.[26]\n Within metamathematics itself, Hilbert imposed a standard of \ndemonstrative evidence stricter even than that demanded by the \nintuitionists, a form of finitism rivalling (ironically) that of \nKronecker. The demonstration of the consistency of classical \nmathematics was then to be achieved by showing, within the \nconstraints of strict finitistic evidence insisted on by Hilbert, \nthat the formal metamathematical counterpart of a classical proof in \nthat system can never lead to an assertion evidently false, such as \n\\(0 = 1\\).\n\n\nHilbert\u2019s program rested on the insight that, au fond, the \nonly part of mathematics whose reliability is entirely beyond \nquestion is the finitistic, or concrete part: in \nparticular, finite manipulation of surveyable domains of distinct \nobjects including mathematical symbols presented as marks on paper. \nMathematical propositions referring only to concrete objects in this \nsense Hilbert called real, concrete, or \ncontentual propositions, and all other mathematical \npropositions he distinguished as possessing an ideal, or \nabstract character. (Thus, for example, \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) would \ncount as a real proposition, while there exists an odd perfect \nnumber would count as an ideal one.) Hilbert viewed ideal \npropositions as akin to the ideal lines and points \u201cat \ninfinity\u201d of projective geometry. Just as the use of these does\nnot violate any truths of the \u201cconcrete\u201d geometry of the \nusual Cartesian plane, so he hoped to show that the use of ideal \npropositions\u2014even those of Cantorian set theory\u2014would \nnever lead to falsehoods among the real propositions, that, in other \nwords, such use would never contradict any self-evident fact \nabout concrete objects. Establishing this by strictly concrete, \nand so unimpeachable means was thus the central aim of Hilbert\u2019s \nprogram. Hilbert may be seen to have followed Kant in attempting to \nground mathematics on the apprehension of spatiotemporal \nconfigurations; but Hilbert restricted these configurations to \nconcrete signs (such as inscriptions on paper). Hilbert regarded \nconsistency as the touchstone of existence, and so for him the \nimportant thing was the fact that no inconsistencies can arise within\nthe realm of concrete signs, since correct descriptions of concrete \nobjects are always mutually compatible. In particular, within the \nrealm of concrete signs, actual infinity cannot generate \ninconsistencies since, again along with Kant, he held that this \nconcept cannot correspond to any concrete object. Hilbert\u2019s view \nseems accordingly to have been that the formal soundness of \nmathematics issues ultimately, not from a logical source, \nbut from a concrete \n one[27],\n in much the same way as the consistency of truly reported empirical \nstatements is guaranteed by the concreteness of the external \n world[28].\n \n\n\nWeyl soon grasped the significance of Hilbert\u2019s program, and came to \nacknowledge its \u201cimmense significance and \n scope\u201d[29].\n Whether that program could be successfully carried out was, of \ncourse, still an open question. But independently of this issue Weyl \nwas concerned about what he saw as the loss of content resulting from\nHilbert\u2019s thoroughgoing formalization of mathematics. \u201cWithout \ndoubt,\u201d Weyl warns, \u201cif mathematics is to remain a \nserious cultural concern, then some sense must be attached \nto Hilbert\u2019s game of formulae.\u201d Weyl thought that this sense \ncould only be supplied by \u201cfusing\u201d mathematics and \nphysics so that \u201cthe mathematical concepts of number, function,\netc. (or Hilbert\u2019s symbols) generally partake in the theoretical \nconstruction of reality in the same way as the concepts of energy, \ngravitation, electron, \n etc.\u201d[30]\n Indeed, in Weyl\u2019s view, \u201cit is the function of mathematics to \nbe at the service of the natural sciences\u201d. But still:\n\nThe propositions of theoretical physics\u2026 lack that feature\nwhich Brouwer demands of the propositions of mathematics, namely, that\neach should carry within itself its own intuitively comprehensible\nmeaning\u2026. Rather, what is tested by confronting theoretical\nphysics with experience is the system as a whole. It seems that we\nhave to differentiate between phenomenal knowledge or\ninsight\u2014such as is expressed in the statement: \u201cThis leaf\n(given to me in a present act of perception) has this green color\n(given to me in this same perception)\u201d\u2014and theoretical\nconstruction. Knowledge furnishes truth, its organ is\n\u201cseeing\u201d in the widest sense. Though subject to error, it\nis essentially definitive and unalterable. Theoretical construction\nseems to be bound only to one strictly formulable rational principle,\nconcordance, which in mathematics, where the domain of sense data\nremains untouched, reduces to consistency; its organ is creative\nimagination. (Weyl 1949, 61\u201362)\n\n\nWeyl points out that, just as in theoretical physics, Hilbert\u2019s \naccount of mathematics \u201calready\u2026 goes beyond the bounds \nof intuitively ascertainable states of affairs through\u2026 ideal \nassumptions.\u201d (Weyl 1927, 484.) If Hilbert\u2019s realm of \ncontentual or \u201creal\u201d propositions\u2014the domain of \nmetamathematics\u2014corresponds to that part of the world directly \naccessible to what Weyl terms \u201cinsight\u201d or \n\u201cphenomenal knowledge\u201d, then \u201cserious\u201d \nmathematics\u2014the mathematics that practicing mathematicians are \nactually engaged in doing\u2014corresponds to Hilbert\u2019s realm of \n\u201cideal\u201d propositions. Weyl regarded this realm as the \ncounterpart of the domain generated by \u201csymbolic \nconstruction\u201d, the transcendent world focussed on by \ntheoretical physics. Hence his memorable characterization:\n\nThe set-theoretical approach is the stage of naive realism which is\nunaware of the transition from the given to the transcendent. Brouwer\nrepresents idealism, by demanding the reduction of all truth to the\nintuitively given. In [Hilbert\u2019s] formalism, finally, consciousness\nmakes the attempt to \u201cjump over its own shadow\u201d, to leave\nbehind the stuff of the given, to represent the\ntranscendent\u2014but, how could it be otherwise?, only through the\nsymbol. (Weyl 1949, 65\u201366)\n\n\nIn Weyl\u2019s eyes, Hilbert\u2019s approach embodied the \u201csymbolic \nrepresentation of the transcendent, which demands to be \nsatisfied\u201d, and so he regarded its emergence as a natural \ndevelopment. But by 1927 Weyl saw Hilbert\u2019s doctrine as beginning to \nprevail over intuitionism, and in this an adumbration of \u201ca\ndecisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure \nphenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the \nunderstanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that \nis most primal and most readily open to \n evidence\u2014mathematics.\u201d[31]\n Since by this time Weyl had become convinced that \u201ccreative \nscience\u201d must necessarily transcend what is \nphenomenologically given, he had presumably already accepted that \npure phenomenology is incapable of accounting for theoretical \nphysics, let alone the whole of existence. But it must have been \npainful for him to concede the analogous claim in the case of \nmathematics. In 1932, he asserts: \u201cIf mathematics is \ntaken by itself, one should restrict oneself with Brouwer to the \nintuitively cognizable truths \u2026 nothing compels us to go \nfarther.\u201d If mathematics could be \u201ctaken by \nitself\u201d, then there would be no need for it to justify its \npractices by resorting to \u201csymbolic construction\u201d, to \nemploy symbols which in themselves \u201csignify \nnothing\u201d\u2014nothing, at least, accessible to intuition. But,\nunlike Brouwer, Weyl seems finally to have come to terms with the \nidea that mathematics could not simply be \u201ctaken by \nitself\u201d, that it has a larger role to play in the world beyond \nits service as a paradigm, however pure, of subjective certainty.\n\n\nThe later impact of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems on Hilbert\u2019s\nprogram led Weyl to remark in \n 1949:[32]\n\n\nThe ultimate foundations and the ultimate meaning of mathematics\nremain an open problem; we do not know in what direction it will find\nits solution, nor even whether a final objective answer can be\nexpected at all. \u201cMathematizing\u201d may well be a creative\nactivity of man, like music, the products of which not only in form\nbut also in substance defy complete objective rationalization. The\nundecisive outcome of Hilbert\u2019s bold enterprise cannot fail to affect\nthe philosophical interpretation. (Weyl 1949, 219)\n\n\nThe fact that \u201cG\u00f6del has left us little hope that a \nformalism wide enough to encompass classical mathematics will be \nsupported by a proof of consistency\u201d seems to have led Weyl to \ntake a renewed interest in \u201caxiomatic systems developed before \nHilbert without such ambitious dreams\u201d, for example Zermelo\u2019s \nset theory, Russell\u2019s and Whitehead\u2019s ramified type theory and \nHilbert\u2019s own axiom systems for geometry (as well, possibly, as \nWeyl\u2019s own system in Das Kontinuum, which he modestly fails \nto mention). In one of his last papers, Axiomatic Versus \nConstructive Procedures in Mathematics, written sometime after \n1953, he saw the battle between Hilbertian formalism and Brouwerian \nintuitionism in which he had participated in the 1920s as having \ngiven way to a \u201cdextrous blending\u201d of the axiomatic \napproach to mathematics championed by Bourbaki and the algebraists \n(themselves mathematical descendants of Hilbert) with constructive \nprocedures associated with geometry and topology.\n\n\nIt seems appropriate to conclude this account of Weyl\u2019s work in the \nfoundations and philosophy of mathematics by allowing the man himself\nto have the last word:\n\nThis history should make one thing clear: we are less certain than\never about the ultimate foundations of (logic and) mathematics; like\neverybody and everything in the world today, we have our\n\u201ccrisis\u201d. We have had it for nearly fifty years. Outwardly\nit does not seem to hamper our daily work, and yet I for one confess\nthat it has had a considerable practical influence on my mathematical\nlife: it directed my interests to fields I considered relatively\n\u201csafe\u201d, and it has been a constant drain on my enthusiasm\nand determination with which I pursued my research work. The\nexperience is probably shared by other mathematicians who are not\nindifferent to what their scientific endeavours mean in the contexts\nof man\u2019s whole caring and knowing, suffering and creative existence in\nthe world.
