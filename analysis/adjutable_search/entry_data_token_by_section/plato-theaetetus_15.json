But\nthere can be no beliefs about nothing; and there are false beliefs; so\nfalse belief isn\u2019t the same thing as believing what is not.\n\n\nSome think the Second Puzzle a mere sophistry. Bostock 1988: 165\ndistinguishes two versions of the sophistry: \u201cOn one version, to\nbelieve falsely is\u2026 to believe what is not \u2018just by\nitself\u2019; on the other version, it is to believe what is not\n\u2018about one of the things which are\u2019\u201d. The argument\nof the first version, according to Bostock, \u201cis just that there\nis no such thing as what is not (the case); it is a mere\nnonentity. But just as you cannot perceive a nonentity, so equally you\ncannot believe one either.\u201d Bostock proposes the following\nsolution to this problem: \u201cWe may find it natural to reply to\nthis argument by distinguishing\u2026 propositions [from] facts,\nsituations, states of affairs, and so on. Then we shall say that the\nthings that are believed are propositions, not facts\u2026 so a\nfalse belief is not directed at a non-existent.\u201d\n\n\nThis raises the question whether a consistent empiricist can admit the\nexistence of propositions. At least one great modern empiricist, Quine\n1953: 156\u20137, thinks not. Plato agrees: he regards a commitment to the\nexistence of propositions as evidence of Platonism,\nacceptance of the claim that abstract objects (and plenty of them)\ngenuinely exist. So an explanation of false judgement that invoked\nentities called propositions would be unavailable to the sort of\nempiricist that Plato has in his sights.\n\n\nBostock\u2019s second version of the puzzle makes it an even more\ntransparent sophistry, turning on a simple confusion between the\n\u201cis\u201d of predication and the \u201cis\u201d of\nexistence. As pointed out above, we can reasonably ask whether Plato\nmade this distinction, or made it as we make it.\n\n\nIf the structure of the Second Puzzle is really as Bostock suggests,\nthen the Second Puzzle is just the old sophistry about believing what\nis not (cp. Parmenides DK 29B8, Euthydemus 283e ff.,\nCratylus 429d, Republic 477a, Sophist 263e\nff.). Moreover, on this interpretation of the Second Puzzle, Plato is\ncommitted, in his own person and with full generality, to accepting\n(at least provisionally) a very bad argument for the conclusion that\nthere can be no false belief. It would be nice if an interpretation of\nthe Second Puzzle were available that saw it differently: e.g., as\naccepted by him only in a context where special reasons make the\nSecond Puzzle very plausible in that context.\n\n\nOne such interpretation is defended e.g., by Burnyeat 1990: 78, who\nsuggests that the Second Puzzle can only work if we accept the\n\u201cscandalous analogy between judging what is not and seeing or\ntouching what is not there to be seen or touched\u201d: \u201cA\nmodel on which judgements relate to the world in the same sort of\nunstructured way as perceiving or (we may add) naming, will tie anyone\nin knots when it comes to the question \u2018What is a false\njudgement the judgement/ name of?\u2019. The only available answer,\nwhen the judgement is taken as an unstructured whole, appears to be:\nNothing.\u201d\n\n\nNotice that it is the empiricist who will most naturally tend to rely\non this analogy. It is the empiricist who finds it natural to\nassimilate judgement and knowledge to perception, so far as he can. So\nwe may suggest that the Second Puzzle is a mere sophistry for any\ndecent account of false judgement, but a good argument against the\nempiricist account of false judgement that Plato is attacking. The\nmoral of the Second Puzzle is that empiricism validates the old\nsophistry because it treats believing or judging as too\nclosely analogous to seeing: 188e4\u20137. For empiricism judgement, and\nthought in general, consists in awareness of the ideas that are\npresent to our minds, exactly as they are present to our\nminds. It cannot consist in awareness of those ideas as they are\nnot; because (according to empiricism) we are immediately and\nincorrigibly aware of our own ideas, it can only consist in awareness\nof those ideas as they are. Nor can judgement consist in\nawareness of ideas that are not present to our minds, for\n(according to empiricism) what is not present to our minds cannot be a\npart of our thoughts. Still less can judgement consist in awareness of\nideas that do not exist at all.\n\n\nThe old sophists took false belief as \u201cjudging what is\nnot\u201d; they then fallaciously slid from \u201cjudging what is\nnot,\u201d to \u201cjudging nothing,\u201d to \u201cnot judging at\nall,\u201d and hence concluded that no judgement that was ever\nactually made was a false judgement. The empiricism that Plato attacks\nnot only repeats this logical slide; it makes it look almost\nreasonable. The point of the Second Puzzle is to draw out this\nscandalous consequence.\n",
