Content-Based Theories of Inner Speech\n\nWe have seen that there are a variety of views taken on whether inner\nspeech is indeed a kind of speech, or a kind of thought, or both. A\npopular way to gain added leverage on those questions is to advance an\naccount of the contents of inner speech. Focusing on questions\nconcerning the contents of inner speech also helps to clarify the\ndepth of some of the puzzles and controversies already introduced.\n\nMost generally, the content of a representation is what the\nrepresentation is of or about\u2014it is what the\nrepresentation represents. The content of the word \u201ccat\u201d\nis a certain type of animal (namely, a cat). And, the content of the\nsentence \u201ccats are animals\u201d is the proposition that cats\nare animals. Two distinct representations can have the same content.\nFor instance, the French word \u201cchat\u201d has the same content\nas the English word \u201ccat\u201d; and the French sentence\n\u201cles chats sont des animaux\u201d has the same content as the\nEnglish sentence \u201ccats are animals\u201d. Thus\u2014to borrow\nanalogies from Siegel (2005 [2021])\u2014the contents of a mental\nstate, in the present sense, are akin to the contents of a newspaper\narticle and not akin to the contents of a bucket. Mental contents are\nnot things that are contained within mental states themselves (just as\ncats are not contained within the word \u201ccat\u201d) but are,\ninstead, what the mental states are of or about.\n\nWe will distinguish three broad classes of views about the contents of\ninner speech and several sub-views within them, noting their main\nmotivations and relationships to questions concerning inner\nspeech\u2019s proposed cognitive roles. According to what we will\ncall the \u201cphonological content view\u201d, inner speech\nepisodes always and only have phonological contents. The\ncompeting content-based theories to be discussed hold either that\ninner speech only has semantic contents (the \u201csemantic content\nview\u201d, as we will call it) or that inner speech has phonological\ncontents and semantic and/or other kinds of contents (the\n\u201cmixed contents view\u201d).\n\nAs we will see, the phonological content view is a natural fit with\nthe view, discussed at the beginning of\n Section 1,\n that inner speech is merely a representation of speech and not\nactually a kind of speech. This is because the phonological content\nview sees inner speech as consisting in imagistic representations of\nspeech and as lacking the kinds of contents (or meanings) associated\nwith word tokens themselves. Likewise, those who hold that inner\nspeech is actually speech will typically hold either a mixed contents\nview or a semantic content view, as these views allow inner speech\nepisodes to have the kinds of semantic contents that are typically\nviewed as essential to being a linguistic token.\n",
