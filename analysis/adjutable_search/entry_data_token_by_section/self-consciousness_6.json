    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Thought || The Essential Indexical\n2.1 The Essential Indexical\n\nFirst-personal language and thought is commonly taken to be sui\ngeneris, irreducible to language or thought not containing the\nfirst-person pronoun or corresponding concept (Casta\u00f1eda 1966,\n1967; Perry 1977, 1979, 2001). Arguments for this view have typically\nappealed to the essential role seemingly played by the first-person in\nexplanations of action. This point is supported by a number of\nwell-known examples. Consider Perry\u2019s case of the messy\nshopper,\n\n\nI once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my\ncart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle\non the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he\nwas making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became\nthicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I\nwas the shopper I was trying to catch. (Perry 1979: 33)\n\n\nAs Perry points out, he knew all along that the shopper with the torn\nsack was making a mess. He may also have believed that the oldest\nphilosopher in the shop (in fact himself) was making a mess, yet\nfailed to check his own cart since he falsely believed that Quine was\nat the Deli Counter. Indeed, it seems that for any non-indexical term\na that denotes Perry, it is possible for Perry to fail to\nbelieve anything naturally expressed by the sentence \u201cI am\na\u201d. If so, it is possible for Perry to rationally believe\nthat a is making a mess without believing anything that he\nwould express as \u201cI am making a mess\u201d. It was only when\nPerry came to believe that he himself was making a mess that\nhe stopped the chase. Indeed, it would seem that only the\nfirst-personal content can provide an adequate explanation of\nPerry\u2019s behaviour when he stops. If Perry had come to believe\nthat John Perry is making a mess then, unless he also believed that he\nhimself was John Perry, he would not have stopped. The first-personal\ncontent is \u201cself-locating\u201d, thereby enabling action,\nwhereas the non-first-personal content is not. To use Kaplan\u2019s\n(1977) example, if I believe that my pants are on fire, pure\nself-interest will surely motivate me do something about it. If,\nhowever, I believe that Smith\u2019s pants are on fire, pure\nself-interest will only so motivate me if I also believe that I am\nSmith.\n\nOn this widely accepted picture, then, first-personal thought and\nlanguage is irreducible to non-first-personal thought and language,\nand is essential to the explanation of action (Kaplan 1977: 533; D.\nLewis 1979; McGinn 1983: ch. 6; Recanati 2007: ch. 34; Musholt 2015:\nch. 1; Prosser 2015; Garc\u00eda-Carpintero & Torre 2016).\nImportantly, on Perry\u2019s view, what is irreducible is the\nfirst-personal way of thinking about ourselves, not the facts or\nstates of affairs that make such thoughts true. So, whilst my belief\n\u201cI am F\u201d is not equivalent to any\nnon-first-personal belief, it is true if and only if Smith is\nF, this being the same fact that makes true the\nnon-first-personal \u201cSmith is F\u201d. Thus, whilst\nfirst-person representations are special, a special class of\nfirst-person facts are nowhere to be found (for views that do accept\nthe existence of first-personal facts, see McGinn 1983; Baker 2013;\nalso see Nagel 1986).\n\nPerry (1977, 1979) argues that terms such as \u201cI\u201d which\nare, as he puts it, \u201cessentially indexical\u201d, pose a\nproblem for the traditional Fregean view of belief as a two-place\nrelation between a subject and a proposition (cf. Spencer 2007).\nFregean senses are, according to Perry, descriptive and as Perry has\nargued no description is equivalent to an essential indexical.\nConsequently, no Fregean proposition can be the thing believed when\none believes first-personally. Essential indexicality, if somehow\nforced into the Fregean mould, means that we must implausibly accept\nthat there are incommunicable senses that only the speaker (or\nthinker) is in a position to grasp (see Garc\u00eda-Carpintero &\nTorre 2016); cf.Evans 1981; Longworth 2013). D. Lewis goes further\nthan this, arguing, partly on the basis of his much discussed Two Gods\nexample (1979), in which each God knows all the propositions true at\ntheir world yet fails to know which of the two Gods he\nhimself is, that the objects of belief are not propositions at\nall but rather properties (or centred worlds). That is, since they\nalready know all the true propositions, there is no true proposition\nthe Gods would come to believe when they come to realise which God\nthey are. Essential indexicality forces us away from the model of\npropositions as the objects of belief. Further, Lewis claims that not\njust the explicitly indexical cases, but all belief is in\nthis way self-locating or, in his terminology, de se. On this\naccount, every belief involves the self-ascription of a property and\nso, arguably, is an instance of self-consciousness (for discussion,\nGennaro 1996: ch. 8; Stalnaker 2008: ch. 3; Feit 2008; Cappelen &\nDever 2013: ch. 5; Magidor 2015).\n\nArguments such as Perry\u2019s might be challenged on the grounds\nthat it is not possible to rationally doubt that one is the\nsubject of these conscious states, where that formulation\ninvolves an \u201cintrospective demonstrative\u201d picking out\none\u2019s current conscious states. This, it might be claimed,\nconstitutes a reduction of first-person content (cf. Peacocke 1983:\nch. 5, although his goal is not reductive). Even if it is true,\nhowever, that one cannot doubt that one is the subject of\nthese conscious states, it is not clear that this poses a\nsignificant challenge to Perry\u2019s argument for the essential\nindexicality of the first-person. For one thing, the content itself\ncontains a demonstrative, so indexical, element. Second, it has been\nargued that our capacity to refer to our own experiences itself\ndepends on our capacity to refer to ourselves as ourselves (P.F.\nStrawson 1959: 97; Evans 1982: 253). That is, to think of these\nconscious states is to think of them as these conscious\nstates of mine. If to demonstratively think of one\u2019s\nconscious state is, necessarily, to think of it as\none\u2019s own conscious state, then the purported reduction of\nfirst-person thought to thought not containing the first-person will\nfail.\n\nCappelen and Dever (2013) present a sustained attack on the\nconstellation of philosophical claims surrounding the \u201cessential\nindexical\u201d, including its purported relation to action, and both\nPerry\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s arguments for it (for an alternative\nobjections to Perry and Lewis, see Millikan 1990; Magidor 2015). A\ncentral element in their critique is the claim that cases, such as\nPerry\u2019s shopper, that are often thought to show the special\nconnection between self-consciousness (I-thoughts) and the capacity\nfor action really only show that action explanation contexts do not\nallow for substitution salva veritate, but rather are opaque\n(Cappelen & Dever 2013: ch. 3). Just as, if I am at the airport\nwaiting for Jones, I will only signal that man if I believe\nhim to be Jones, so if I am looking for the shopper with the torn sack\nI will only stop when I believe that I am that shopper. On\ntheir view, despite the popularity of the view to the contrary, the\ncapacity for self-consciousness does not possess any philosophically\ndeep relation to the capacity for action.
