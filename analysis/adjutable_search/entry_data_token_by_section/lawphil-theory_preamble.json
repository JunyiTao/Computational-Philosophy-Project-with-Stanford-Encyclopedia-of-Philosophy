    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe idea of a Pure Theory of Law was propounded by the formidable\nAustrian jurist and philosopher Hans Kelsen (1881\u20131973) (see the\nbibliographical note). Kelsen began his long career as a legal\ntheorist at the beginning of the 20th century. The traditional legal\nphilosophies at the time, were, Kelsen claimed, hopelessly\ncontaminated with political ideology and moralizing on the one hand,\nor with attempts to reduce the law to natural or social sciences, on\nthe other hand. He found both of these reductionist endeavors\nseriously flawed.  Instead, Kelsen suggested a \u2018pure\u2019\ntheory of law which would avoid reductionism of any kind. The\njurisprudence Kelsen propounded \u201ccharacterizes itself as a\n\u2018pure\u2019 theory of law because it aims at cognition focused\non the law alone\u201d and this purity serves as its \u201cbasic\nmethodological principle\u201d (PT1, 7).\n",
