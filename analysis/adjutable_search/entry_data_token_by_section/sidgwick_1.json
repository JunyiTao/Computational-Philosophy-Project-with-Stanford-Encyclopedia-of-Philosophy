    "main_text": "The Methods Of Ethics And Philosophy || Preliminaries\n2.1 Preliminaries\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods was long in the making. His\ncorrespondence with his close friend H. G. Dakyns, a Clifton master\nwho had been a private tutor for the Tennyson family, reveals how long\nand volatile the development of his ethical views was, particularly\nduring the 1860s when he was working himself free of Anglican\northodoxy. As early as 1862, he wrote to Dakyns that he was\n\u201crevolving a Theory of Ethics\u201d and working on \u201ca\nreconciliation between the moral sense and utilitarian theories\u201d\n(Memoir: 75). He started telling people that he was\n\u201cengaged on a Great Work\u201d, which would indeed turn out to\nbe the case. By 1867, much of the basic intellectual structure of the\nMethods was clearly in place; according to Marshall, at the\nfaculty discussion group known as the \u201cGrote Club\u201d,\nSidgwick \n\n\nread a long & general sketch of the various systems of morality:\nI. Absolute right II. Make yourself noble III. Make yourself happy IV\nIncrease the general happiness. In the course of it he committed\nhimself to the statement that without appreciating the effect of our\naction on the happiness of ourselves or of others we could have no\nidea of right & wrong. (quoted in Schultz 2004: 142)\n\n\nIt was also in 1867 that Sidgwick sent a draft of his pamphlet on\n\u201cThe Ethics of Conformity and Subscription\u201d to J. S. Mill,\ninviting comments. This work, part of his efforts with the Free\nChristian Union (an organization for promoting free and open religious\ninquiry), reflected his casuistical struggles over whether he had a\nright to keep his Fellowship, given his increasingly Theistic views.\nHe had been increasingly drawn to Theism, which then, as now, stressed\nthat \u201cGod\u2019s will and purpose, and God\u2019s assurance of\nan ultimate fulfilment, are behind all that is happening\u201d\n(Polkinghorne 1998: 114), but without the orthodox commitments to\nbelief in the Trinity, miracles, eternal punishment, etc.. As Sidgwick\nexplained to his sister: \n\n\nI have written a pamphlet \u2026 on the text \u201cLet every man be\nfully persuaded in his own mind\u201d. That is really the gist of the\npamphlet\u2014that if the preachers of religion wish to retain their\nhold over educated men they must show in their utterances on sacred\noccasions the same sincerity, exactness, unreserve, that men of\nscience show in expounding the laws of nature. I do not think that\nmuch good is to be done by saying this, but I want to liberate my\nsoul, and then ever after hold my peace. (Memoir: 226) \n\n\nAs he put it in the pamphlet, which appeared in 1870:\n\n\nWhat theology has to learn from the predominant studies of the age is\nsomething very different from advice as to its method or estimates of\nits utility; it is the imperative necessity of accepting unreservedly\nthe conditions of life under which these studies live and flourish. It\nis sometimes said that we live in an age that rejects authority. The\nstatement, thus qualified, seems misleading; probably there never was\na time when the number of beliefs held by each individual,\nundemonstrated and unverified by himself, was greater. But it is true\nthat we only accept authority of a particular sort; the authority,\nnamely, that is formed and maintained by the unconstrained agreement\nof individual thinkers, each of whom we believe to be seeking truth\nwith single-mindedness and sincerity, and declaring what he has found\nwith scrupulous veracity, and the greatest attainable exactness and\nprecision. (Sidgwick 1870: 14\u201315)\n\n\nThis was a vision of inquiry and even culture that Sidgwick would\npromote throughout his life, though after this point he no longer\nopenly directed his criticisms at the church. Mill had replied to his\neffort to address the question of subscription on\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cutilitarian\u201d grounds: \n\n\nWhat ought to be the exceptions \u2026 to the general duty of truth?\nThis large question has never yet been treated in a way at once\nrational and comprehensive, partly because people have been afraid to\nmeddle with it, and partly because mankind have never yet generally\nadmitted that the effect which actions tend to produce on human\nhappiness is what constitutes them right or wrong. (Mill 1867)\n\n\nMill urged Sidgwick to turn his \u201cthoughts to this more\ncomprehensive subject\u201d, and apparently when the latter did, he\nconcluded that it would not be conducive to the general happiness to\ncontinue his open attacks on organized religion. The reasons for this\nlarger conclusion are only partly evident from the Methods\nitself.\n\nSidgwick did always explicitly claim, however, that his struggles with\nthe ethics of subscription shaped the views set forth in the\nMethods. These struggles had led him \u201cback to\nphilosophy\u201d from his more theological and philological\ninvestigations\u2014for which he had learned German and Hebrew and\nstruggled with biblical hermeneutics. He found the problem of whether\nhe ought to resign his Fellowship very \n\n\ndifficult, and I may say that it was while struggling with the\ndifficulty thence arising that I went through a good deal of the\nthought that was ultimately systematised in the The Methods of\nEthics. (Memoir: 38) \n\n\nOne of the ways in which this is evident has been highlighted in the\nwork of J. B. Schneewind, whose Sidgwick\u2019s Ethics and\nVictorian Moral Philosophy (1977) was the most comprehensive and\nsophisticated commentary on Sidgwick\u2019s ethics produced in the\ntwentieth century. As part of an extensive account of the historical\ncontext of the Methods, underscoring how Sidgwick\u2019s\nwork was shaped by both the utilitarian tradition and its intuitionist\nand religious opposition (represented in part by the \u201cCambridge\nMoralists\u201d William Whewell, Julius Hare, F. D. Maurice, and John\nGrote), Schneewind argued that\n\n\nit is a mistake to view the book as primarily a defence of\nutilitarianism. It is true, of course, that a way of supporting\nutilitarianism is worked out in detail in the Methods, and\nthat there are places in it where Sidgwick seems to be saying quite\nplainly that utilitarianism is the best available ethical theory. From\nhis other writings we know also that he thinks of himself as committed\nto utilitarianism, and that he assumes it in analysing specific moral\nand political issues. Yet it does not follow that the Methods\nitself should be taken simply as an argument for that position. We\nmust try to understand it in a way that makes sense of its\nauthor\u2019s own explicit account of it. (Schneewind 1977: 192)\n\n\nThat account, as both Schneewind and Rawls have stressed, repeatedly\naffirms that the aim of the book is less practice than knowledge, \n\n\nto expound as clearly and as fully as my limits will allow the\ndifferent methods of Ethics that I find implicit in our common moral\nreasoning; to point out their mutual relations; and where they seem to\nconflict, to define the issue as much as possible. \n\n\nThat is, echoing his views on theological inquiry, he confesses\nthat:\n\n\nI have thought that the predominance in the minds of moralists of a\ndesire to edify has impeded the real progress of ethical science: and\nthat this would be benefited by an application to it of the same\ndisinterested curiosity to which we chiefly owe the great discoveries\nof physics. It is in this spirit that I have endeavoured to compose\nthe present work: and with this view I have desired to concentrate the\nreader\u2019s attention, from first to last, not on the practical\nresults to which our methods lead, but on the methods themselves. I\nhave wished to put aside temporarily the urgent need which we all feel\nof finding and adopting the true method of determining what we ought\nto do; and to consider simply what conclusions will be rationally\nreached if we start with certain ethical premises, and with what\ndegree of certainty and precision. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: vi])\n\n\nThe model for such an approach is not Bentham or even J. S. Mill, but\nAristotle, whose Ethics gave us \n\n\nthe Common Sense Morality of Greece, reduced to consistency by careful\ncomparison: given not as something external to him but as what\n\u201cwe\u201d\u2014he and others\u2014think, ascertained by\nreflection. \n\n\nThis was really, in effect, \u201cthe Socratic induction, elicited by\ninterrogation\u201d (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: xix]).\n\nAs Marcus Singer and others have observed (M. Singer 1974; Phillips\n2022), Sidgwick\u2019s notion of a \u201cmethod\u201d of ethics is\nnot the same as that of an ethical principle, ethical theory, or\nethical decision-procedure. A \u201cmethod\u201d is a way of\n\u201cobtaining reasoned convictions as to what ought to be\ndone\u201d and thus it might reflect a commitment to one or more\nethical principles as the ultimate ground of one\u2019s determination\nof what one has most reason to do, here and now, while allowing that\none might ordinarily be reasoning from such principles either directly\nor indirectly. Thus, one might, on theological grounds, hold that the\nmoral order of the universe is utilitarian, with God willing the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number, while also holding that the\nappropriate guide for practical reason is enlightened self-interest,\nsince utilitarian calculations are God\u2019s business and God has\nordered the cosmos to insure that enlightened self-interest conduces\nto the greatest happiness. In this case, one\u2019s \u201cmethod of\nethics\u201d would be rational egoism, but the ultimate philosophical\njustification for this method would appeal to utilitarian principles.\nStill, despite this emphasis on the reasoning process between\nprinciples and practical conclusions\u2014another reflection of his\nstruggles with subscription\u2014Sidgwick obviously had quite a bit\nto say in the Methods about the defense of the ultimate\nprinciples of practical reason (Crisp 2014, 2015; de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014; Phillips 2022).\n\nMany have felt that, in setting up the systematic comparison between\nthe main methods of ethics, Sidgwick was not nearly as neutral and\nimpartial as he thought, and in various ways slanted the discussion\nagainst a wide range of alternatives, including Aristotelian and other\nforms of perfectionism, Whewellian rationalism, Idealism, and more\n(Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin 1992, 2007, 2011; Hurka 2014a, 2014b). He\nsimply dismisses the traditional philosophical concern with the\n\u201cmoral faculty\u201d, explaining that he is going to leave that\nmatter to psychologists. For Sidgwick, in any given situation, there\nis something that it is right or that one ought to do, and this is the\nproper sphere of ethics. The basic concept of morality is this unique,\nhighly general notion of \u201cought\u201d or \u201cright\u201d\nthat is irreducible to naturalistic terms, sui generis,\nthough moral approbation is \n\n\ninseparably bound up with the conviction, implicit or explicit, that\nthe conduct approved is \u201creally\u201d right\u2014that is, that\nit cannot without error, be disapproved by any other mind. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 27]) \n\n\nOn this count, at least, his student G. E. Moore was willing to\ndeclare the Methods untainted by the \u201cnaturalistic\nfallacy\u201d\u2014that is, the confusion of the \u201cis\u201d of\nattribution and the \u201cis\u201d of identity that supposedly\ninfected much previous ethical theory, including that of Bentham and\nthe Mills. And indeed, it is plain that Sidgwick parted company from\nclassical utilitarianism in many ways, rejecting the empiricism,\npsychological egoism, and associationism (supposedly) characteristic\nof the earlier tradition. F.H. Hayward, who wrote one of the first\nbooks on Sidgwick\u2019s ethics, famously complained that E. E.\nConstance Jones had missed just how original Sidgwick was: \n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s identification of \u201cRight\u201d with\n\u201cReasonable\u201d and \u201cObjective\u201d; his view of\nRightness as an \u201cultimate and unanalysable notion\u201d\n(however connected subsequently with Hedonism); and his admission that\nReason is, in a sense, a motive to the will, are due to the more or\nless \u201cunconscious\u201d influence of Kant. Miss Jones appears\nto think that these are the common-places of every ethical system, and\nthat real divergences only arise when we make the next step in\nadvance. I should rather regard this Rationalistic terminology as\nsomewhat foreign to Hedonism. I do not think that Miss Jones will\nfind, in Sidgwick\u2019s Hedonistic predecessors, any such emphasis\non Reason (however interpreted). (Hayward 1901b: 361) \n\n\nSidgwick himself allowed that Kant was one of his\n\u201cmasters\u201d, and he was also quite familiar with the works\nof Hegel. Schneewind\u2019s reading (1977) has stressed this\ninfluence, along with the influence of Joseph Butler, whose works\npersuaded Sidgwick of the falsity of psychological egoism and of the\nreality of other than self-interested actions (Frankena 1992). Indeed,\nthe comparison between Sidgwick and Kant has proved to be a fertile\nand ongoing source of academic work on Sidgwick, and one of increasing\nsignificance (Parfit 2011\u20132017; Paytas 2018; Paytas &\nHenning [eds] 2020; Phillips 2022)\n\nHowever, despite the considerable influence Kant and\nKantianism\u2014and the Cambridge Moralists\u2014exercised on\nSidgwick, the Methods also deviated from some stock features\nof such views, among other things rejecting the issue of free will as\nlargely irrelevant to ethical theory and failing to appreciate the\nKantian arguments about expressing one\u2019s autonomy and the\nincompatibility of the categorical imperative and rational egoism. As\nSchneewind allows, Sidgwick\u2019s\n\n\nbasic aim is similar to Kant\u2019s, but, as his many points of\ndisagreement with Kant suggest, the Kantian aspect of his thinking\nneeds to be defined with some care. He detaches the issue of how\nreason can be practical from the most distinctive aspects of\nKantianism. He rejects the methodological apparatus of the\n\u201ccritical philosophy\u201d, the Kantian distinction of noumenal\nand phenomenal standpoints, and the association of the issue with the\nproblem of free will. He treats the question of the possibility of\nrationally motivated action as answerable largely in terms of\ncommonplace facts; he does not attribute any special synthesizing\npowers to reason beyond those assumed in ordinary logic; and he does\nnot take morality to provide us with support for religious beliefs..\nIn refusing to base morality on pure reason alone, moreover, he moves\ndecisively away from Kant, as is shown by his very un-Kantian\nhedonistic and teleological conclusions.. These points make it clear\nthat the Kantian strain in Sidgwick\u2019s thought is most marked in\nhis central idea about the rationality of first principles.\n(Schneewind 1977: 419\u201320)\n\n\nNaturally, a Sidgwickian position on the venerable free will issue is\nbound to be controversial, and recent work on the Sidgwick/Kant\ncomparison has brought out just how divided commentators continue to\nbe on this matter (Crisp 2015; Skelton 2016; Paytas 2018, Paytas &\nHenning [eds] 2020; Phillips 2022). Moreover, there has also been\nsignificant controversy over just how internalist Sidgwick\u2019s\naccount of moral motivation actually was. On balance, he held that the\ndictates or imperatives of reason were \u201caccompanied by a certain\nimpulse to do the acts recognized as right\u201d, while admitting\nthat other impulses may conflict (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 34]). Brink\n(1988, 1992) has urged that some of Sidgwick\u2019s chief arguments\nmake better sense if he is construed, in externalist fashion, as\nallowing the possibility that one may have good reasons not to be\nmoral. But Sidgwick\u2019s moderate, qualified internalism seems\nplain and plausible enough to most commentators (Schultz 2004; de\nLazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Crisp 2015).\n\nThere has been perhaps even more controversy surrounding\nSidgwick\u2019s account of the \u201cgood\u201d. The\nMethods is at least fairly clear in arguing that the\ndifference between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d in part\nconcerns the way in which judgments of ultimate good do not\nnecessarily involve definite precepts to act or even the assumption\nthat the good in question is attainable or the best attainable good\nunder the circumstances. Rightness and goodness thus \u201crepresent\ndifferentiations of the demands of our own rationality as it applies\nto our sentient and our active powers\u201d (Schneewind 1977: 493).\nBut Sidgwick offers an intricate account of ultimate good that has\nstruck some as highly naturalistic. In A Theory of Justice,\nRawls famously explained that Sidgwick \n\n\ncharacterizes a person\u2019s future good on the whole as what he\nwould now desire and seek if the consequences of all the various\ncourses of conduct open to him were, at the present point of time,\naccurately foreseen by him and adequately realized in imagination. An\nindividual\u2019s good is the hypothetical composition of impulsive\nforces that results from deliberative reflection meeting certain\nconditions. (Rawls 1971 [1999: 366]) \n\n\nSome have followed the Rawlsian line in casting Sidgwick as a defender\nof a naturalistic \u201cfull-information\u201d account of the\n\u201cgood\u201d (for example, Sobel 1994; Rosati 1995), but the\nbalance of scholarly opinion has it that Sidgwick\u2019s account\nadumbrates an \u201cobjective\u201d view that allows that some\ndesires, however informed, may be rejected as irrational or\nunreasonable (see especially Phillips 2022: 74\u201376; Schneewind\n1977; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Parfit 1984, 2011a,b).\nCrisp (2007, 2015) and Shaver (1997) provide helpful reviews of the\ndebates; although the former offers perhaps the best possible defense\nof the interpretation of Sidgwick\u2019s view as a naturalistic\nfull-information account (with an experience requirement), it also\nadmits that the objective list reading is a more charitable one.\n\nSome commentators have made much of the difference between Sidgwick\nand Moore on the notion of ultimate good, urging that whereas Sidgwick\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of \u201cright\u201d, Moore\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of \u201cgood\u201d, while adding\na suspect ontological claim about \u201cgoodness\u201d involving a\nnon-natural property (Moore 1903; Shaver 2000). However, Hurka (2003)\nhas offered some forceful arguments against most such accounts:\n\n\nAfter defining the good as what we ought to desire, he [Sidgwick]\nadded that \u201csince irrational desires cannot always be dismissed\nat once by voluntary effort\u201d, the definition cannot use\n\u201cought\u201d in \u201cthe strictly ethical sense\u201d, but\nonly in \u201cthe wider sense in which it merely connotes an ideal or\nstandard\u201d. But this raises the question of what this\n\u201cwider sense\u201d is, and in particular whether it is at all\ndistinct from Moore\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d. If the claim that we\n\u201cought\u201d to have a desire is only the claim that the desire\nis \u201can ideal\u201d, how does it differ from the claim that the\ndesire is good? When \u201cought\u201d is stripped of its connection\nwith choice, its distinctive meaning seems to slip away. (Hurka 2003:\n603\u20134)\n\n\nMoreover, as Hurka has developed the point, the \n\n\ninitial reviewers of Principia did not see it as altering\nSidgwick\u2019s ontology but emphasized its continuity with Sidgwick,\nwhile Moore himself said little about his non-natural property and\neven tried to limit his metaphysical claims, saying that though\ngoodness is an object and therefore \u201cis somehow\u201d,\nit does not \u201cexist\u201d, and in particular does not exist in a\n\u201csupersensible reality\u201d. (Hurka 2014a: 90)\n\n\nAt any rate, for his part (and unlike Moore), Sidgwick goes on to\nargue that, despite the serious problems with the views of previous\nutilitarians (for example, the Millian account of the\n\u201chigher\u201d pleasures), the best going account of ultimate\ngoodness is a hedonistic one, and that this is an informative,\nnon-tautological claim, though also a more controversial one than many\nof the others that he defends. That was putting it mildly, and\ncommentators past and present have struggled to try to determine\nwhether Sidgwick regarded the hedonistic account of good as grounded\non another cognitive intuition, but one of a lower degree of certainty\nthan the others he endorses (Phillips 2022: 86\u201389). As Skelton\naptly observes, \n\n\nSidgwick is a hedonist: pain is the only non-instrumental evil;\npleasure is the only non-instrumental good. His argument for hedonism\nin ME [Methods of Ethics] Book III, chapter xiv is a mess. (Skelton\n2022)\n\n\nFor one thing, as Irwin and Richardson have cogently argued,\nSidgwick\u2019s hedonistic commitments, and his criticisms of such\nviews as T. H. Green\u2019s, often reflected the (problematic)\nconviction that practical reason simply must be fully clear and\ndeterminate in its conclusions (Irwin 1992: 288\u201390; Richardson\n1994). For Sidgwick, without some such metric as the hedonistic one,\nit was hopelessly unclear how to weigh one virtue against another. But\nwhether or not that is actually the case, he advanced other arguments\nas well, such as whether one can really recommend making people more\nvirtuous at the expense of their hedonistic happiness. What if the\nvirtuous life were conjoined to extreme pain, with no compensating\ngood to anyone? At many points, as Shaver observes, \n\n\nSidgwick works out what it is reasonable to desire, and so attaches\nmoral to natural properties, by the ordinary gamut of\nphilosopher\u2019s strategies\u2014appeals to logical coherence,\nplausibility, and judgment after reflection. (Shaver 1997: 270) \n\n\nBut many problems remain, since Sidgwick\u2019s arguments about the\nfundamental nature of pleasure and pain are far from perspicuous.\nAccording to Rawls, \n\n\nSidgwick denies that pleasure is a measurable quality of feeling\nindependent of its relation from volition. This is the view of some\nwriters, he says, but one he cannot accept. He defines pleasure\n\u201cas a feeling which, when experienced by intelligent beings, is\nat least apprehended as desirable or\u2014in cases of\ncomparison\u2014preferable\u201d. It would seem that the view he\nhere rejects is the one he relies upon later as the final criterion to\nintroduce coherence among ends. (Rawls 1971 [1999: 488]) \n\n\nAnd Sumner, in an important treatment related to what is called the\n\u201cheterogeneity\u201d of pleasures problem, has also urged that\nSidgwick and Mill, by contrast with Bentham,\n\n\nseemed to recognize that the mental states we call pleasures are a\nmixed bag as far as their phenomenal properties are concerned. On\ntheir view what pleasures have in common is not something internal to\nthem\u2014their peculiar feeling tone, or whatever\u2014but\nsomething about us\u2014the fact that we like them, enjoy them, value\nthem, find them satisfying, seek them, wish to prolong them, and so\non. (Sumner 1996: 86)\n\n\nAccepting the heterogeneity of pleasures objection to the feeling tone\naccount, along with a \u201cresonance constraint\u201d to the effect\nthat what is good for someone must somehow resonate with what they\ncare about, and the view that \u201cwhat is ultimately good is\npleasure, understood as desirable consciousness\u201d, de\nLazari-Radek and Singer urge that Sidgwick takes a position that is\n\u201cintermediate between internalism and externalism\u201d (de\nLazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 254). In their vigorous defense of\nSidgwickian hedonism against all rival accounts of ultimate good,\nincluding the desire satisfaction view that Singer had previously\nadopted, they explain that \n\n\nthe hedonist will not say that it is good for a person to be in a\nconscious state that she does not take to be desirable, and to this\nextent hedonism satisfies the resonance constraint and is internalist.\nOn the other hand, hedonism does insist that what is good or bad for\nyou is your states of consciousness, and nothing else, irrespective of\nwhether what you desire is to have certain states of consciousness.\n(de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 253) \n\n\nThus, satisfying a desire for posthumous fame, which if satisfied\nwould not resonate with any of conscious states one could possibly\nhave, would not be good for the person in question. Shaver (2016) has\nalso offered a subtle account and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s notion\nof pleasure as feeling apprehended, perhaps wrongly, as desirable qua\nfeeling, rather than as feeling manifesting a special tone of\npleasantness. However, as Skelton warns, with accounts like these, the\nwording is a very delicate matter: \n\n\nAt one point, Sidgwick says that if we accept his definition of\npleasure, it is a tautology that pleasure is good ... But this would\nfollow for him only if pleasure is defined as desirable feeling,\nsince, for Sidgwick, desirable means good. But this would not be true\nif, for him, pleasure is defined as feelings apprehended to be\ndesirable. It is not a tautology to say feelings apprehended to be\ndesirable are in fact desirable. (Skelton 2022: 9) \n\n\nAnd whether or how this apprehension is something only\n\u201cexperienced by intelligent beings\u201d also calls for\ncritical attention, since that stipulation would seem to implausibly\nnarrow the scope of sentience. \n\nBut in contrast to the above accounts, Crisp, who defends an\ninternalist, feeling tone account of pleasure, argues persuasively\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s writings did not express his better inclinations\non the subject \n\n\nSidgwick is at heart an internalist about pleasure who was mislead by\nthe heterogeneity argument into offering an externalist view which is\nopen to serious objections. (Crisp 2007: 134; 2015 70) \n\n\nFor Crisp, \n\n\nthe heterogeneity objection moves in an unjustified way from the\nobviously true claim that the kinds of experience that are enjoyed are\nvery various to the claim that the feeling of enjoyment is not some\nphenomenologically internal property common to all such experiences.\nOn the face of it, it might appear that there is such a property: We\ncan ask of any enjoyable experience whether it felt enjoyable, or\nwhether it was more or less enjoyable than some other experience, and\nit is quite plausible to suggest that answers to these questions do\nnot involve our attending to any attitude or other state external to\nthe enjoyment or lack of it in question. (Crisp 2015: 67) \n\n\nEnjoyment is a determinable, like color vision, with particular\nenjoyments being determinates, like seeing particular colors. Crisp\nconcludes that some such account of enjoyment, or pleasure, would have\nbetter served Sidgwick, as Sidgwick himself half realized.\n\nClearly, recent years have witnessed some remarkable rehabilitations\nof Sidgwick\u2019s ethical hedonism, particularly in the works of\nCrisp (2007, 2015), Feldman (2004, 2010), and de Lazari-Radek and\nSinger (2014, 2016). And clearly, the forms of hedonism being defended\nusually reconfigure or qualify the Sidgwickian approach in important\nways, in part out of necessity, because of the obscurity of\nSidgwick\u2019s position on the fundamental issues. These\nrehabilitations of Sidgwickian hedonism have also involved, for some,\na recognition of the importance of the hedonimetrics of F. Y.\nEdgeworth, the brilliant economist who was a slightly junior\ncontemporary of Sidgwick\u2019s and one of his most enthusiastic\nphilosophical disciples, though one whose work has until recently been\nlargely ignored in philosophical commentary on Sidgwick (Edgeworth\n1877, 1881 [2003]). Edgeworth\u2019s approach has been revived in\neconomics by such figures as Kahneman (2011), and the convergence of\neconomic and philosophical, and neurobiological, interests on this\npoint suggests that hedonism remains a live option in ethics, though\nin key respects Sidgwick\u2019s account, obscure as it is, remains\nsuperior to these more recent developments, which rely on a rather too\ncrude claim about pleasurable consciousness as a state that a subject\nwishes to prolong. Indeed, despite philosophical hedonism being a core\ncommitment of classical utilitarianism past and present, no account of\nit, whether Sidgwick\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s, is problem free\nand uncertainty abounds. For example, de Lazari-Radek and Singer,\nwhile initially impressed by the heterogenity objection, are now no\nlonger sure that it is decisive: \n\n\nAs Crisp notes, in our book we approve of this \u201cheterogeneity\nobjection\u201d, and cite the work of the neuroscientists Kent\nBerridge and Morten Kringelbach in support of the view that pleasure\nis not a sensation, but rather is a kind of \u201chedonic\ngloss\u201d that our hedonic brain systems paint on certain\nsensations. Crisp thinks that it is better to interpret Berridge and\nKringelbach as saying that pleasure is not merely a sensation, but\nallowing that the hedonic gloss may itself be a sensation, or a single\ntype of feeling. We are now willing to concede that Crisp may be right\non this If so, the heterogeneity objection can be met, to the extent\nthat we can say that the hedonic systems of the brain put the same\nkind of hedonic gloss on various different sensations. (Singer &\nde Lazari-Radek 2016: 205\u20136)\n\n\nBut as de Lazari-Radek and Singer admit, this might not prove to be\nmuch of a victory:\n\n\nThe question is, however, whether this does not simply transfer the\nproblem of saying what pleasure is to the problem of saying what the\nhedonic gloss is. How is it to be distinguished from other feelings?\nIf we answer this question by saying that it is just a particular kind\nof feeling, in the way that sweetness is a particular kind of taste,\nthen anyone who thinks that pleasure is intrinsically good needs to\nexplain why just this kind of feeling has intrinsic value. If some\npeople do not desire this kind of feeling, even qua feeling, then\nhedonistic theories of the good will fail to satisfy what, following\nPeter Railton, we have called \u201cthe resonance\nrequirement\u201d\u2014we will be telling such people that pleasure\nis good for them, but this will not resonate with anything they desire\nor value. Obviously, the same problem recurs if we describe the\nhedonic gloss in terms of certain brain states. If, on the other hand,\nwe say that the hedonic gloss is to be distinguished from other\nfeelings by the fact that we do desire it, qua feeling, we are back to\nwhere we started, with pleasure being whatever mental state we desire,\nqua mental state. These problems remain in need of more work. (Singer\n& de Lazari-Radek 2016: 206)\n\n\nWithout getting into the problematic conflation here of\n\u201cdesired\u201d and \u201cdesirable\u201d, or\n\u201capprehended as desirable\u201d, it should be plain enough that\nthe controversies Sidgwick sparked are ongoing. To make matters worse,\nNozick\u2019s venerable \u201cExperience Machine\u201d objection to\nhedonism\u2014to the effect that for hedonism a virtual, or Matrix\nlike programmed world is as good as the real one\u2014has received\nnew life with the growth of concerns over developments with AI and the\nmetaverse, which seem to exert a disturbing pressure on people,\nespecially young people, to assume that their good or well-being just\nis what goes on in their heads, however undesirable that may be\n(Mulgan 2020: 26\u201328).\n\n",
