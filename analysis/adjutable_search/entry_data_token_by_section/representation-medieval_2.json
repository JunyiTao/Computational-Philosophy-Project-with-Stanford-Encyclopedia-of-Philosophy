    "main_text": "Peter Olivi and the Rejection of Formal Sameness\n3. Peter Olivi and the Rejection of Formal Sameness\n\nOne of the first to criticize the species theory of cognition, in the\nlate thirteenth century, was Peter Olivi. He argued, contrary to\nAristotle and Aquinas, that the mind is active in its cognition of the\nworld; it attends to the object, and it is this move on his part that\nputs the species theory of cognition in a completely different light.\nIn fact, there seems little point in postulating a species through\nwhich the object is cognized. He argues:\n\nThird, because the attention will tend toward the species either in\nsuch a way that it would not pass beyond so as to attend to the\nobject, or in such a way that it would pass beyond. If in the first\nway, then the thing will not be seen in itself but only its image will\nbe seen as if it were the thing itself. That is the role of a memory\nspecies, not a visual one. If in the second way, then after the\ninspection of the species it will inspect the object in itself. In\nthis way it will cognize the object in two ways, first through the\nspecies and second in itself. It will indeed be like when someone sees\nan intervening space and then beyond that sees the fixed object.\n(Peter John Olivi, Quaestiones in secundum librum\nSententiarum, III, q. 74, 123.)\n\n\nIn this passage, it seems clear that for Olivi the species is a thing\nin itself and that there really are three things involved in the\ncognition of an object: the object, the species, and the cognizer. The\nspecies is on his view a representation, namely a thing that stands in\nfor the object in the mind. The main problem he sees with the theory\nis hence epistemological. How can we be sure we are cognizing the\nobject and not the species (see Toivanen 2009, Chap. 4 and Adriaenssen\n2011). Olivi hence argues that this third representing thing is not\nneeded and that the mind can attend to the object directly. Ockham is\nlater on in the early fourteenth century to repeat a similar argument\nagainst the species theory.\n\nBoth Olivi and Ockham seem to take it for granted that species are\nrepresentations and hence a thing added to the object and the\ncognizer. There were, however, two versions of the species theory of\ncognition in the thirteenth century. The most influential one was\nforemost associated with Roger Bacon. According to him, species are\nrepresentations, that is, real extended images like objects\nrepresenting the thing cognized to the cognizer. The other version of\nthe theory was defended by Aquinas. According to him, species were not\nrepresentations but the forms themselves of the objects cognized under\na different mode of being. The species were not real but spiritual and\nas such there are no physical change of for example the eye in a\nvisual perception; only a spiritual one.\n\nOlivi\u2019s objection mentioned above does not apply to\nAquinas\u2019 theory since species are not real representations on\nthat view. Olivi himself seems aware of this, however, and says that\nif the species has spiritual being, then they cannot: \u201ctruly and\nnaturally flow from a natural, corporeal form, [and] not really and\ntruly inform a natural body, e.g. the air or the eye.\u201d\n(Sententiarum II, q. 73, 87.) On Aquinas\u2019 theory the\nspecies cannot affect the sense organ and cause a cognition, he seems\nto think. The species cannot hence fulfill the role they are supposed\nto play in a theory of cognition or a theory of vision.\n\nOlivi does not straight our reject all species, however, since he\nthinks memory utilizes species. These species are representations and\nthey are constructed by us. He explains it in the following\npassage:\n\nCognitive acts are effected by the [cognitive] power \u2014 not,\nhowever, through its nude essence. Rather, in all [cognitive acts] an\nactual attention, actually terminated upon the object, is\nrequired\u2026. And therefore, when the exterior thing\nin-and-of-itself (per se) is not placed before the attention, there\nmust be a memorative species placed before it in lieu of the object,\nwhich [the species] is not the origin of the cognitive act, except\ninsofar as it serves as a term for or representative of the object.\n(Sententiarum II, q. 74, 113.)\n\n\nThis is the most common usage of species after Olivi, that is, that\nspecies are representative (see Adriaenssen 2017).\n",
