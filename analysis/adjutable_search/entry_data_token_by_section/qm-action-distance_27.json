Recall also that one\nof the lines of argument for the impossibility of relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories is that such theories would give rise to\ncausal paradoxes. In our discussion, we focused on EPR/B experiments\nin which the measurements are distant (spacelike separated). In a\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theory, the setting of the nearby\nmeasurement apparatus in the EPR/B experiment would influence the\nprobability of the distant (spacelike separated) measurement\noutcome. Sutherland (1985, 1989) argues that it is plausible to\nsuppose that the realization of parameter dependence would be the same\nin EPR/B experiments in which the measurements are not distant from\neach other (i.e., when the measurements are timelike separated). If so,\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories would involve backward\ncausal influences. But, he argues, in deterministic, relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories these influences would give rise to\ncausal paradoxes, i.e., inconsistent closed causal loops.\n \n\nFurthermore, Arntzenius (1994) argues that all relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories are impossible on pain of causal\nparadoxes. In his argument, he considers the probabilities of\nmeasurement outcomes in a setup in which two EPR/B experiments are\ncausally connected to each other, so that the L-measurement outcome of\nthe first EPR/B experiment determines the setting of the L-apparatus\nof the second EPR/B experiment and the R-measurement outcome of the\nsecond EPR/B experiment determines the setting of the R-apparatus of\nthe first EPR/B experiment. And he argues that in this experiment,\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories (deterministic or\nindeterministic) would give rise to closed causal loops in which\nparameter dependence would be impossible. Thus, he concludes that\nrelativistic, parameter-dependent theories are impossible. (Stairs\n(1989) anticipates the argument that the above experimental setup may\ngive rise to causal paradoxes in relativistic, parameter-dependent\ntheories, but he stops short of arguing that such theories are\nimpossible.)\n\n\nBerkovitz (1998b, section 3.2, 2002, section 4) argues that\nArntzenius's line of reasoning fails because it is based on untenable\nassumptions about the nature of probabilities in closed causal\nloops\u2014assumptions that are very natural in linear causal\nsituations (where effects do not cause their causes), but untenable in\ncausal loops. (For an analysis of the nature of probabilities in\ncausal loops, see Berkovitz 2001 and 2002, section 2.) Thus, he\nconcludes that the consistency of relativistic parameter-dependent\ntheories cannot be excluded on the grounds of causal paradoxes. He\nalso argues that the real challenge for relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories is concerned with their predictive\npower. In the causal loops predicted by relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories in Arntzenius's suggested experiment,\nthere is no known way to compute the frequency of events from the\nprobabilities that the theories prescribe. Accordingly, such theories\nwould fail to predict any definite statistics of measurement outcomes\nfor that experiment. This lack of predictability may also present some\nnew opportunities. Due to this unpredictability, there may be an\nempirical way for arbitrating between these theories and quantum\ntheories that do not predicate the existence such causal loops in\nArntzenius's experiment. \n\n\nAnother attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of certain\nrelativistic quantum theories on the grounds of causal paradoxes is\nadvanced by Maudlin (1994, pp. 195-201). (Maudlin does not present his\nargument in these terms, but the argument is in effect based on such\ngrounds.) Recall (sections 2 and 9) that a way to try to reconcile\nquantum mechanics with relativity is to account for the curious\ncorrelations between distant systems by local backward influences\nrather than non-local influences. In particular, one may postulate\nthat the correlations between the distant measurement outcomes in the\nEPR/B experiment are due to local influences from the measurement\nevents backward to the state of the particle pair at the source. In\nsuch models of the EPR/B experiment, influences on events are always\nconfined to events that occur in their past or future light cones, and\nno non-locality is postulated. Maudlin argues that theories that\npostulate such backward causation will be inconsistent. More\nparticularly, he argues that a plausible reading of Cramer's (1980,\n1986) transactional interpretation, and any other theory that\nsimilarly attempts to account for the EPR/B correlations by\npostulating causation from the measurement events backward to the\nsource, will be inconsistent. \n\n\nBerkovitz (2002, section 5) argues that Maudlin's argument is, in\neffect, that if such retro-causal theories were true, they would\ninvolve closed causal loops in which the probabilities of outcomes\nthat these theories assign will certainly deviate from the statistics\nof these outcomes. And, similarly to Arntzenius's argument, Maudlin's\nargument also rests on untenable assumptions about the nature of\nprobabilities in causal loops (for a further discussion of Maudlin's\nand Berkovitz's arguments and, more generally, the prospects of\nCramer's theory, see Kastner 2004). Furthermore, Berkovitz (2002,\nsections 2 and 5.4) argues that, similarly to relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories, the main challenge for theories that\npostulate retro-causality is not causal paradoxes, but rather the fact\nthat their predictive power may be undermined. That is, the\nprobabilities assigned by such theories may fail to predict the\nfrequency of events in the loops they predicate. In particular, the\nlocal retro-causal theories that Maudlin considers fail to assign any\ndefinite predictions for the frequency of measurement outcomes in\ncertain experiments. Yet, some other theories that predicate the\nexistence of causal loops, such as Sutherland's (2006) local\ntime-symmetric Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics, seem not\nto suffer from this problem.\n",
