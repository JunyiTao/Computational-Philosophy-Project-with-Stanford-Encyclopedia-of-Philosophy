    "main_text": "Life and Thought after The Star || Translation\n4.5 Davos: Cohen, Cassirer, Heidegger\n\n\nRosenzweig died on December 10, 1929. Seven months before his death,\nin May of 1929, Rosenzweig had written a short essay, \u201cTransposed\nFronts,\u201d occasioned by the coincidence of two events: the recent\nsecond issuing of Hermann Cohen\u2019s Religion of Reason out of\nthe Sources of Judaism, and the celebrated disputation held at\nDavos, in March-April of that year, between Ernst Cassirer and Martin\nHeidegger. Rosenzweig\u2019s essay claims that a consideration of the\nDavos exchange in the light of Cohen\u2019s late work suggests,\nsurprisingly, that it is not Cassirer, Cohen\u2019s disciple, but\nrather Heidegger, the heir to Cohen\u2019s position of prominence at\nMarburg, who carries on in the direction of Cohen\u2019s most\nsignificant contribution to the thought of the time. Rosenzweig\u2019s\nlate essay is important, moreover, for the way it shows Rosenzweig,\nshortly before his death, reflecting on contemporary philosophical\ndevelopments and trying to situate such developments within the context\nof, or in relation to, his own \u201cnew thinking\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cTransposed Fronts\u201d repeats the controversial claim\nRosenzweig had made in his 1924 \u201cIntroduction\u201d to Hermann\nCohen\u2019s Jewish Writings: the notion of\n\u201ccorrelation\u201d which Cohen develops in his late work amounts\nto a break from the critical Idealism which had made him the center of\nMarburg neo-Kantianism, and an advance into the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d espoused by Rosenzweig\u2019s circle. Cohen\u2019s\ncritical idealism, Rosenzweig had asserted in his\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d took \u201cnature\u201d and\n\u201chumanity\u201d to be products of reason in its\ntheoretical and practical domains, and it thus remained exemplary of\nthe tendency of the \u201cold thinking\u201d to root all that is in a\nsingle Absolute ground. But the notion of \u201ccorrelation\u201d\nwhich Cohen develops, in his Religion of Reason in particular,\nportrays reason not as generative of its objects, but rather as the\nmedium through which God and human being, posited as irreducibly\nfactual beings, step into reciprocal relation.\n\n\nThe irony of the Davos disputation, Rosenzweig suggests, is that\nCohen\u2019s actual disciple, Cassirer, proves himself still mired in\nthe \u201cold thinking\u201d of Cohen\u2019s early work, while\nHeidegger, the apparent usurper of the Marburg stage upon which Cohen\nmade his name, turns out to be more true to Cohen\u2019s decisive\nphilosophical contribution. Indeed, Rosenzweig suggests that\nCohen\u2019s notion of \u201ccorrelation\u201d leads the way to\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201cleap into Dasein.\u201d Heidegger\u2019s\nsense that the task of philosophy is to uncover for the\n\u201cfinite\u201d human being the \u201cnothingness\u201d wrapped\nup in her freedom, rather than to posit an Absolute being as her\nground, makes him the proper heir indeed to Cohen\u2019s late\ndiscovery of the irreducibility of the individual being standing in\ncorrelation with the divine. It thereby stamps Heidegger\u2019s\nthought as kin to the very \u201cnew thinking\u201d whose crowning\nrepresentative Rosenzweig himself was. \n",
