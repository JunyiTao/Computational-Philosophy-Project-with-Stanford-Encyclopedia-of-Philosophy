Life\n\nBernard Bosanquet was born on July 14, 1848 in Rock Hall (near\nAlnwick), Northumberland, England. He was the youngest of five sons of\nthe Reverend Robert William Bosanquet by the latter\u2019s second\nwife, Caroline (MacDowall). Bernard\u2019s eldest brother, Charles,\nwas one of the founders of the Charity Organization Society and its\nfirst Secretary. Another brother, Day, was an Admiral in the Royal\nNavy and served as Governor of South Australia. Yet another, Holford,\nwas elected to the Royal Society and was a fellow of St John\u2019s\nCollege, Oxford.\n\nBosanquet studied at Harrow (1862\u20131867) and at Balliol College,\nOxford (1867\u20131870), where he came under the influence of German\nidealist philosophy, principally through his teacher T.H. Green and\nthe work of Benjamin Jowett. (Green reputedly described Bosanquet as\n\u201cthe best equipped man of his generation\u201d [Muirhead 1935,\np. 21; McBriar 1987, p. 3].) Bosanquet received first class honors in\nclassical moderations (1868) and literae humaniores (1870)\nand, upon graduation, was elected to a Fellowship of University\nCollege, Oxford, over F.H. Bradley. While at University College,\nBosanquet taught the history of logic and the history of moral\nphilosophy; his only published work during this time was a translation\nof G.F. Schoemann\u2019s Athenian Constitutional\nHistory.\n\nUpon the death of his father in 1880 and the receipt of a small\ninheritance in 1881, Bosanquet left Oxford for London, where he became\nactive in adult education and social work through such organizations\nas the London Ethical Society (founded 1886), the Charity Organisation\nSociety, and the short-lived London School of Ethics and Social\nPhilosophy (1897\u20131900). During this time he met and married (in\n1895) Helen Dendy, an activist in social work and social reform, who\nwas to be a leading figure in the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws\n(1905\u20131909).\n\nWhile in London, Bosanquet was also able to engage in philosophical\nwork, and many of his major publications date from this time. Some of\nthem\u2014such as The Philosophical Theory of the State and\nPsychology of the Moral Self\u2014were developed from\nlectures that he gave to adult education groups. He was an early\nmember of the Aristotelian Society, and served as its Vice President\n(1888) and President (1894\u20131898).\n\nIn 1903, at the age of 55, Bosanquet briefly returned to university\nlife, as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of St Andrews\nin Scotland. His health, however, was not good and soon he wished to\ndevote more time to philosophical writing. He retired in 1908 to\nOxshott, Surrey, where he nevertheless remained active in social work\nand philosophical circles. In 1910, Bosanquet was appointed Gifford\nLecturer in the University of Edinburgh for 1911 and 1912. The text of\nthese lectures\u2014The Principle of Individuality and Value\nand The Value and Destiny of the Individual\u2014serve as\nthe most developed statement of his metaphysical views. Understanding\nBosanquet\u2019s metaphysics, however, requires recognizing that it\nreflects his earlier work in logic, ethics, social work, and political\nphilosophy.\n\nThe publication of the Gifford lectures incited a good deal of\ncritical reaction to Bosanquet\u2019s views, particularly in\nmetaphysics (e.g., on the idealism/materialism controversy and on the\nnature of finite individuality), logic (e.g., concerning the status of\npropositions and the nature of inference), and ethics. Despite his\nvigorous participation in such exchanges, present throughout\nBosanquet\u2019s work is his desire to find common ground among\nphilosophers of various traditions and to show relationships among\ndifferent schools of thought, rather than to dwell on what separates\nthem.\n\nIn spite of the challenges to idealism from both within and outside of\nthe academic world, discussion of Bosanquet\u2019s work continued\nthrough the early decades of the 20th century. He died in\nhis 75th year in London on February 8, 1923.\n\nAt the time of his death, Bosanquet was arguably \u201cthe most\npopular and influential of the English idealists\u201d (Randall 1966,\np. 488). He was the author or editor of more than 20 books and some\n150 articles. The breadth of his philosophical interests is obvious\nfrom the range of topics treated in his books and essays\u2014logic,\naesthetics, epistemology, social and public policy, psychology,\nmetaphysics, ethics and political philosophy. For his contributions to\nphilosophy and to social work, he had been made a Fellow of the\nBritish Academy in 1907, and had received honorary degrees from\nGlasgow (1892), Durham (1903), Birmingham (1909), and St Andrews\n(1911).\n\nBosanquet was one of the earliest philosophers in the Anglo-American\nworld to appreciate the work of Edmund Husserl, Benedetto Croce,\nGiovanni Gentile and Emile Durkheim, and the relation of his thought\nto that of Ludwig Wittgenstein, G.E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell is\nsignificant, though still largely unexplored. Although F.H. Bradley is\ntoday far better known in philosophical circles, in his obituary in\nthe Times, Bosanquet was said to have been \u201cthe central\nfigure of British philosophy for an entire generation.\u201d\n2. General Background\n\nBosanquet\u2019s philosophical views were in many ways a reaction to\n19th century Anglo-American empiricism and materialism\n(e.g., that of Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Alexander Bain),\nbut also to that of contemporary personalistic idealism (e.g., that of\nAndrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, James Ward, Hastings Rashdall, W.R.\nSorley, and J.M.E. McTaggart) and organicism (e.g., Herbert Spencer).\nBosanquet held that the inspiration of many of his ideas could be\nfound in Hegel, Kant, and Rousseau and, ultimately, in classical Greek\nthought. Indeed, while at the beginning of his philosophical career\nBosanquet described Kant and Hegel as \u201cthe great masters who\n\u2018sketched the plan\u2019\u201d (Muirhead 1935, p. 21; see\nBosanquet, Knowledge and Reality, p. vii), he said that the\nmost important influence on him was that of Plato. The result was a\nbrand of idealist philosophical thought that combined the Anglo-Saxon\npenchant for empirical study with a vocabulary and conceptual\napparatus borrowed from the continent. Bosanquet is generally\nconsidered to be one of the most Hegelian of the British Idealists,\nthough the extent to which the term \u2018Hegelian\u2019 is\nappropriate or illuminating in describing his work has been a matter\nof some debate (Sweet 1995).\n\nMore directly, Bosanquet\u2019s thought shows a number of\nsimilarities to that of T.H. Green, his teacher, and to Bradley, his\ncontemporary. Bosanquet himself acknowledges that these similarities\nare far from coincidental. He frequently admits his debt to\nGreen\u2019s works and, as late as 1920, he wrote that \n\n\nsince the appearance of Ethical Studies\u2026 I have recognized\n[Bradley] as my master; and there is never, I think, any more than a\nverbal difference or difference of emphasis, between us.(Letter to\nLello Vivante, 27 March 1920, cited in Muirhead 1935, p. 262)\n\n\nThere is, however, at least some hyperbole in such comments. Bosanquet\ndid not follow either Green or Bradley blindly (see Sweet 1996), and\nthere are important differences in his work. While he defended\nGreen\u2019s ethical theory and many of Green\u2019s conclusions, he\naddressed a number of issues never dealt with in Green\u2019s corpus.\nMoreover, while it is clear that Bosanquet considered Bradley\u2019s\nwork in metaphysics and ethics to have been momentous, this admiration\nwas no doubt influenced by the fact that Bradley\u2019s philosophy\nand method reflected interests and an approach that Bosanquet had\narrived at quite independently.\n3. Principal Contributions\n3.1 Logic and Epistemology\n\nBosanquet\u2019s earliest philosophical writing was in logic; his\ninterest in the area continued throughout his career, and it was\ninitially considered to be the area in which he made his most\nsignificant contributions to philosophy. \n\nThe first published statement of Bosanquet\u2019s views on logic\nappears in his 1883 essay, \u201cLogic as the Science of\nKnowledge.\u201d Here, one finds an explicit debt to Hegel and to\nLotze (whose System of Philosophy he was encouraged by T.H.\nGreen to translate and edit). Developed expositions of\nBosanquet\u2019s logic appear in his Knowledge and Reality: A\nCriticism of Mr F.H. Bradley\u2019s \u2018Principles of\nLogic\u2019 (1885) and in Logic, or the Morphology of\nKnowledge (1888). (The main themes of this latter work were\nrecast in a short volume, The Essentials of Logic [1895].)\nBosanquet produced a second edition of his Logic in 1911,\nadding a number of notes and three chapters dealing specifically with\npragmatist and realist criticisms of idealist coherence theory. During\nthe last decade of his life he engaged in a number of exchanges on\nquestions in logic, culminating in the publication of Implication\nand Linear Inference (1920), which C.D. Broad described as\ncontaining \u201cthe clearest and most plausible account\u201d of\nBosanquet\u2019s views (Broad 1920, p. 323). \n\nFor Bosanquet, logic is central to philosophy, but it is\n\u2018logic\u2019 in a broad sense. He writes: \n\n\nBy Logic we understand, with Plato and Hegel, the supreme law or\nnature of experience, the impulse towards unity and coherence\n[\u2026] by which every fragment yearns towards the whole to which\nit belongs\u2026 (Principle of Individuality and Value, p.\n340). \n\n\nThe \u201cinherent nature of reason,\u201d Bosanquet adds, is\n\u201cthe absolute demand for totality and consistency\u201d\n(Value and Destiny of the Individual, p. 9). Moreover,\nlogic\u2014 which Bosanquet calls \u201cthe spirit of\ntotality\u201d\u2014is \u201cthe clue to reality, value and\nfreedom\u201d (Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 23).\nNot surprisingly, then, Bosanquet argues that\nmetaphysics\u2014\u201cthe general science of\nreality\u201d\u2014cannot be distinguished from logic\u2014the\nscience of knowledge\u2014any more than one can separate a result\nfrom the process which produces it. \n\nDespite the connection between logic and knowledge, however, Bosanquet\ndenied that he was doing epistemology\u2014in the sense of a theory\nof cognition in which truth and reality are treated as independent of\none another. \n\nIn general, there are three key elements to Bosanquet\u2019s logic.\n\n\nFirst, logic is concerned with \n\n\nthe properties which are possessed by objects or ideas in so far as\nthey are members of the world of knowledge. (Essentials of\nLogic, p. 44) \n\n\nEverything that can be studied must be \u201casserted\u201d in\nconsciousness and, thus, is ultimately the concern of logic. \n\nSecond, Bosanquet writes that reality is \n\n\ncomposed of contents determined by systematic combination in a single\ncoherent structure. (Logic, p. 5) \n\n\nTo have a complete description of some thing, then, it must be\nunderstood in its context and in its relations to other things.\nSimilarly, to say that a judgement is \u2018true\u2019, we must take\nthe system in which the judgement is bound up and then note \n\n\nhow unintelligible that part of our world\u2026 would become if we\ndenied that judgement. (\u201cLogic as the Science of\nKnowledge\u201d, Works, vol. 1, p. 302) \n\n\nBosanquet\u2019s view is best described, then, as a coherence\ntheory\u2014though it is one that is concerned with more than the\nformal consistency of the set of true propositions. \n\nThird, according to Bosanquet, \n\n\nthe true meaning of propositions lies always ahead of fully conscious\nusage, as the real reality lies ahead of actual experience\n(Logic, 2nd ed., p. x). \n\n\nOur understanding of the world, then, is always incomplete.\nNevertheless, \n\n\nexperience forces thought along certain lines from partial to more\ncomplete notions. (\u201cLogic as the Science of Knowledge\u201d,\nWorks, vol. 1, p. 311) \n\n\nCoherence, therefore, is attained by a dialectical, evolutionary\nprocess. But this does not mean that humanity will some day arrive at\nultimate truth. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s logic has been the subject of significant\ndiscussion; the focus of this was, and still is, is the nature of\ninference and the theory of induction. \n\nIn Implication and Linear Inference, for example, Bosanquet\ndefends his long-standing view that inference is \u201cevery process\nby which knowledge extends itself\u201d (op. cit., p. 2). It\nis made possible by implication\u2014i.e., the property of each\nsystem whereby one can go from one part to all other parts. Standard\nformal logic (e.g., linear inference or syllogistic) is only a limited\nform of inference for, as Bosanquet reminded his readers, logical\nprinciples are not part of some abstract real but are the expression\nof the movement and life of the mind. \n\nBosanquet considered induction as importantly related to deduction; in\nthis respect, his views are similar to those of Christoph Sigwart and\nW.S. Jevons. To see specifically how induction and deduction are\nrelated, one must start with Bosanquet\u2019s distinction between the\nverification of a hypothesis and its establishment. In induction, a\nhypothesis is \u201cverified by the agreement of its deduced\nconclusion with observed facts\u201d; it is established only\n\u201cin proportion as we are convinced that the verified results\ncould not be deduced from any other principle\u201d (\u201cLogic as\nthe Science of Knowledge\u201d, Works, vol. 1, p. 329). But\nthen Bosanquet adds that \u201cevery verified result is pro tanto a\nconfirmation of any principles from which it is deducible\u201d\n(ibid.). Inference, then, is neither deductive (i.e., from\ngeneral principles) nor inductive (e.g., from instances or sense\ndata), but \u201csystematic\u201d\u2014it proceeds from within a\nwhole or a system. Thus, knowledge does not exist as a set of isolated\nformal propositions; all that we know is within a system. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s view of inference and of induction had significant\nconsequences, not only for the then-contemporary understanding of\nlogic\u2014by challenging the view that deductive inference is\n\u201cuseless\u201d (because those who know the premises already\nknow the content of the conclusion)\u2014but also for the\n\u2018new\u2019 logic of Frege, as developed by Russell and\nWhitehead, where judgement was separated from inference and\n\u2018linear implication\u2019 was the norm. It is perhaps for this\nreason that Bosanquet\u2019s arguments incited not only a\nwide-ranging critical response\u2014particularly from the\n\u2018neo-realists\u2019 at Cambridge and in the United\nStates\u2014but also the tantalizing remark by Wittgenstein to Moore\nin 1914 (cited in McGuinness 1988: 199\u2013200) that some of\nWittgenstein\u2019s (unsuccessful) Cambridge B.A. dissertation was\n\u201ccribbed\u201d from Bosanquet\u2019s logic.\n\nAlthough Bosanquet\u2019s logic follows, in many respects, that of\nHegel, it arguably avoids Bertrand Russell\u2019s criticism of\nHegel\u2019s logic\u2014i.e., that it unconsciously assumes and\nincorporates the faults of traditional logic. Indeed,\nBosanquet\u2019s defense of elements of classical deductive logic\nagainst J.S. Mill\u2019s criticisms \u201cmade philosophy safe for\nlogic\u201d and was, in large part, responsible for\n\u201crehabilitating\u201d logic in British philosophy, particularly\nafter the critiques of Locke and his successors (see Allard 2007). It\nhas also been argued (by Fred Wilson 2007) that Bosanquet\u2019s\nviews on logic and scientific method are close to those of some\ncontemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural laws, such as\nFred Dretske and David Armstrong.\n3.2 Metaphysics and the Theory of the Absolute\n\nBosanquet\u2019s publications on metaphysics date from the late\n1880s, but it was not until the early 1910s, when he was in his 60s,\nthat he published his comprehensive statement on the topic\u2014his\nGifford lectures, The Principle of Individuality and Value\nand The Value and Destiny of the Individual. It is important\nto realise that it was only after he had developed his views in\nethics, social work, philosophical psychology, and political\nphilosophy, that his metaphysics took its final form. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s first essays on metaphysics\u2014\u201cIs Mind\nSynonymous with Consciousness?\u201d and \u201cWhat Takes Place in\nVoluntary Action?\u201d\u2014focused on the nature of mind, and in\n1893\u201394 he offered a course of lectures that became the basis of\nhis book, Psychology of the Moral Self (1897). Opposed to the\ncrude associationist and the \u2018push and pull\u2019 psychology of\nempiricists (such as David Hume, J.S. Mill, and Alexander Bain) who\nheld that thought consists of disconnected, discrete data of the\nsenses, and the \u2018psychological habits\u2019 that arise out of\nthe contiguous relations of these data, Bosanquet argued that one\ncannot separate the human individual from everything makes up its\nworld. It does not follow, however, that reality is not autonomous of\nindividual consciousness. Bosanquet writes that \u201ceverything is\nreal so long as you do not take it for more than it is\u201d\n(Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 240, see\nLogic, Vol. 1, p. 273) (see Hamilton Grant 2015).\n\nA key interest of Bosanquet was the articulation of a theory of mind\nand will. In Psychology of the Moral Self, in a lecture on\n\u201cThe Organisation of Intelligence\u201d, Bosanquet argues that\n\u201c[t]he psychical elements of the mind are so grouped and\ninterconnected as to constitute what are technically known as\nAppercipient masses or systems\u201d (op. cit., p. 42). The\nmind or self, then, is a multiplicity of such systems. Bosanquet\ndescribes the mind, then, as \u201ca growth of material, more like a\nprocess of crystallization, the material moulding itself according to\nits own affinities and cohesions\u201d (op. cit., p.\n9)\u2014a view which, he says, is implicit in Plato and\nAristotle.\n\nIn his Gifford lectures, Bosanquet moves beyond the discussion of mind\nin order to focus on a principle underlying much of his philosophical\nthought and rooted in his studies in logic\u2014individuality. \n\nIn the first series of Gifford lectures, The Principle of\nIndividuality and Value, Bosanquet holds that when we speak of\n\u2018the real\u2019 or \u2018truth\u2019, we have in mind a\n\u2018whole\u2019 (i.e., a system of connected members), and it is\nby seeing a thing in its relation to others that we can say not only\nthat we have a better knowledge of that thing, but that it is, as\nBosanquet writes, \u201cmore complete\u201d, more true, and more\nreal. Since this whole is self-contained and self-sufficient,\nBosanquet calls it (following Aristotle) an \u2018individual\u2019.\nBut because of its \u2018independence\u2019 and self explanatory\ncharacter or necessity, it is also a universal. The\n\u2018whole\u2019 is, then, what Bosanquet calls a \u201cconcrete\nuniversal\u201d. This \u201clogical universal as a living\nworld\u201d he calls \u201cindividuality\u201d or \u201cthe\nAbsolute\u201d (op. cit., p. xx), and the metaphysical\nposition he adopts is often referred to \u2018absolute\nidealism\u2019.\n\nAccording to Bosanquet, the \u201cmainspring of movement and effort\nin [the finite] world\u201d is \u201ccontradiction\u201d (op.\ncit., p. xxviii). Nevertheless, as principles come into conflict,\na process of harmonisation also occurs. Terms are readjusted or new\ndistinctions are introduced, so that conflicting elements find a place\nin the result. This process or method of meeting and removing\ncontradiction, characteristic of the growth of any thing, is what\nBosanquet calls the argument a contingentia mundi, and it is\nthrough this process that we come to the Absolute. \n\nIndividuality is the principle of value. Since individuality is\n\u201clogical self-completeness [and] freedom from incoherence\u201d\n(op. cit., p. xxxi), Bosanquet holds that, in as far as\nthings are completely organised and have parts which confirm and\nsustain one another, they have value; it is not a matter of whether\nthey are, as in utilitarian accounts, desired. \n\nIn Bosanquet\u2019s metaphysics, there is no rigid line between\n\u2018nature\u2019 or the physical, and \u2018mind,\u2019 and it\nmakes no sense to talk of a \u2018transcendent,\u2019 as some kind\nof \u2018supernatural\u2019 world (see \u201cThe True Conception of\nAnother World\u201d; see also Mander 2017: 242). Bosanquet is clearly\nopposed to dualism; he sees the mind as \u201ca perfection and\ncooperation of the adaptations and acquisitions stored in the\nbody\u201d (op. cit., p. xxv) and not a separate thing,\nindependent of the body. Bosanquet\u2019s anti-dualism does not,\nhowever, lead to panpsychism\u2014the view that all nature has\nconsciousness. (In this respect he appears to differ from F.H.\nBradley.) Still, he argues that nature is complete only through human\nconsciousness. Human consciousness serves, Bosanquet holds, as a\n\u201ccopula\u201d between nature and the Absolute. \n\nIn the second series of Gifford lectures, The Value and Destiny of\nthe Individual, Bosanquet focuses on how his theory of the\nAbsolute bears on the nature and value of the finite (i.e., human)\nindividual. He does so, first, by saying something of the evolution or\ndevelopment of the human person, as both a natural being and a being\npossessing a self-determining will; then, by looking at finite beings\nin relation to one another; and, finally, by showing how finite\nselfhood can have stability and security. Progress in the development\nof the human individual, Bosanquet suggests, is not serial nor should\nit be seen as approximation towards a defined telos. The destiny of\nthe finite self is that it comes to recognise itself as an element of\nthe Absolute; it is in relation to this, Bosanquet says, that one sees\nits value.\n\nSome critics responded that Bosanquet\u2019s arguments radically\nreduced or eliminated the value of the human person because, they\nclaimed, the \u201cperfection of human personality\u201d that he\nadvocated was not the development of a finite individual as a finite\nindividual. This issue was the focus of an important exchange among\nBosanquet, Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, G.F. Stout, and R.B. Haldane\non \u201cDo Individuals Possess a Substantive or Adjectival Mode of\nBeing?\u201d (Bosanquet et al. 1918). Here, Bosanquet asserts that\nindividuals characterise the world \u201cas permanent\nqualifications\u201d\u2014but, at the same time, he reiterates his\nview that finite selves are not \u201cnecessarily eternal or\neverlasting units\u201d (op. cit., pp. 86\u201387). Still,\none may say that while Bosanquet\u2019s absolute idealism leads him\nto reject certain conceptions of the self, he does not reject its\nexistence or its value. He simply denies that finite individuals are\nwholly independent centres or ultimate principles of value. Extensive\nscholarship by Mander (2005) and Sweet (1997a) suggest that\nBosanquet\u2019s case was stronger than Pringle-Pattison\u2019s.\n\nAlthough Bosanquet described his approach as \u2018idealist\u2019,\nhe was aware that the term was broad and potentially misleading. In\nwork published after the Gifford lectures, Bosanquet took pains to try\nto explain how his view was entirely unlike the subjective idealism\nchallenged by G.E. Moore\u2019s \u201cThe Refutation of\nIdealism\u201d (1903) and, in \u201cRealism and Metaphysic\u201d\n(1917), Bosanquet suggested that his philosophy could be more\naccurately described as \u201cspeculative\u201d.\n\nBosanquet pursued this issue of the character of his philosophy in\nThe Distinction between Mind and its Objects (1913) and in\nthe last book to be published during his lifetime, The Meeting of\nExtremes in Contemporary Philosophy (1921).\n\nIn The Distinction between Mind and its Objects\u2014which\ndealt with common characteristics of American neo-realism and Italian\nneo-idealism (specifically, that of Benedetto Croce and Giovanni\nGentile), and the relation of his own account to that of philosophical\nrealism and the neo-realists\u2014Bosanquet argued that the terms\n\u2018idealism\u2019 and \u2018realism\u2019 are both vague and\nmisleading. There are, as he notes, different kinds of realism and\ndifferent kinds of idealism as well. Moreover, the terms are not\nantithetical; in fact, Bosanquet saw some affinity between his\nposition and that of the realist Samuel Alexander. Nevertheless,\nBosanquet thoroughly rejected the views of such authors as R.B. Perry,\nW.P. Montague, and E.B. Holt. He argued that, while aiming at\nproviding a comprehensive view of reality, this \u2018new\nrealism\u2019 restricts the place of mind and cuts it off from\nphysical reality. (For a recent mention, see Hamilton Grant, in\nFerraris 2014: 10). \n\nThe very title of The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary\nPhilosophy (1921) reveals Bosanquet\u2019s conviction that,\ndespite the apparently radical differences separating them, there is a\nconvergence both in aim and in result of the investigations of the\ndifferent dominant philosophical schools \u2014for example, on such\nmatters as the reality of time, positive development in ethics, and\nhuman progress. Bosanquet notes that, although there is a clear\ndisagreement among critical realists and absolutists concerning the\nnature of \u2018the real\u2019, as each seeks a complete account, it\nis led to positions that are characteristic of its\n\u2018opponent\u2019. Bosanquet\u2019s own \u201cspeculative\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014based, he maintains, on careful analysis of\nexperience\u2014complements both of the preceding approaches.\nBosanquet argued that, with a more reasoned understanding of progress\nand a correct account of the nature of \u2018individuality\u2019 and\nthe \u2018unity\u2019 of reality (where mind and its objects are\nseen together in a single context), the absurdities of the extremes of\nidealism and realism can be avoided, and the opposition between them\ncan be overcome. \n3.3 Religion\n\nBosanquet\u2019s philosophical views on religion were in large part\ninfluenced by early nineteenth century biblical\nstudies\u2014initially, mediated through the writings of Green,\nEdward Caird, and Benjamin Jowett.\n\nThe work of David Strauss, Ferdinand Baur, and others, at the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, marked a turn in the scholarly\napproach to religion and scripture, towards what is now called\n\u2018the scientific study of religion\u2019. Religious experience,\nsacred texts, and religious practice were now to be seen as phenomena\nopen to critical investigation and which could\u2014and\nshould\u2014be examined independently of one\u2019s religious\ncommitment, and according to the principles of literary and historical\nanalysis. Strauss and his followers challenged the tendency to equate\nreligious dogmas and creeds with original religious experience, and\nthey were particularly doubtful whether one could recover much\nknowledge of such experience from \u2018events\u2019 recorded in\nscripture.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, this approach to the study of religion\nhad established itself in Britain, particularly in Oxford. Figures\nsuch as Jowett and Caird, and others in the Church of England\n\u2018Broad Church movement\u2019 (such as Frederick Temple, Bishop\nJ.W. Colenso, and Thomas Arnold) argued for a more analytical and\nrational approach to understanding religious belief\u2014though they\nwere frequently criticised for this by Church authorities.\n\nThe distinction of practice from dogma and experience from creeds was,\nhowever, also a feature of the evangelical movement within the Church\nof England. Bosanquet, like many of his fellow idealists, was raised\nin an Evangelical household; his later philosophical views, then, can\nbe seen as an evolution, rather than an interruption or contradiction,\nof his early religious convictions.\n\nDespite his conventional religious upbringing, Bosanquet was not an\northodox Christian. While he did claim that religion was not only\ncentral to one\u2019s life, but was that which made life worth\nliving, he held that, taken literally or at face value, many\nparticular religious beliefs are either incoherent or false. Bosanquet\nnotes that, in religion, \u201crationalism, curiosity, metaphor, and\ndeduction from metaphor, operate by way of distortion\u201d (What\nReligion Is, p. 68), and that, to help one read biblical texts,\none must engage in a hermeneutical enterprise, and \u201clearn to\ninterpret\u201d them\u2014though, even here, he doubted whether\n\u201cthe sacred books of a Church\u201d can ever be\n\u201cunderstood in their actual meaning\u201d (Essays and\nAddresses, p. 132). Moreover, some religious beliefs do not mean\nwhat many take them to mean. Bosanquet argues, for example, that, if\nwe examine the idea of God\u2014who is often described as an\n\u2018infinite individual\u2019\u2014we will find that to attribute\n\u2018infinity\u2019 to a being would be inconsistent with\n\u201cevery predicate which we attach to personality\u201d. Finally,\nBosanquet held that religious belief in general is not about some\nsupernatural being or transcendent realm, entering into our daily\nlives. It focuses, rather, on what takes place in the world. His\nanalysis of religion and religious belief is, then,\n\u2018immanentist\u2019.\n\nBosanquet distinguished religious beliefs about particular persons or\nevents from \u2018religion\u2019 (or, what was the same thing for\nhim, \u2018faith\u2019 or \u2018religious consciousness\u2019).\nStill, he did not see himself as either an agnostic or atheist, or as\nreducing \u2018religion\u2019 to the \u2018ethical\u2019. While he\nstates that there is much in Christianity that is no longer\nintelligible, he insists that religion\u2014in the sense of religious\nconsciousness\u2014is needed for morality, and that an ethics cut off\nfrom religion is \u201cwithout sap or life\u201d. Similarly,\nBosanquet\u2019s opposition to seeing religion or religious belief as\na faith in something supernatural does not mean that he denied the\nexistence of the spiritual or held a reductionist view of reality.\nWhen it comes to human consciousness, he argued, the\nspiritual\u2014the \u2018inward\u2019 transfiguration of the\n\u2018outward\u2019 aspects of life\u2014is at least as much a part\nof what exists as the visible and material. This\n\u2018infinite\u2019 here is what Bosanquet called the\n\u2018Absolute\u2019.\n\nHuman beings are, Bosanquet noted, aware of something infinite that\nbears directly on their lives, and in his entry on Philosophy of\nReligion, for J.M. Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary of Philosophy and\nPsychology (1902), he writes that it is this awareness, and\none\u2019s commitment to \n\n\nthat set of objects, habits, and convictions, whatever it might prove\nto be, which [one] would rather die for than abandon, or at least\nwould feel himself excommunicated from humanity if he did abandon \n\n\nthat constitutes what religion is (Collected Works, vol. 1,\np. 33). (While some idealists, such as Pringle-Pattison, seem to have\nheld that such an Absolute is God, Bosanquet did not\u2014though\nneither does he explicitly reject the existence of God.) Still,\nreligious belief is neither the same as, nor tied essentially to,\nrituals and practices. Neither does it require adherence or assent to\na set of propositions or dogmas\u2014and certainly not to a set of\npropositions focusing on beings or events in the history of a\ncommunity of believers. Religious belief is, in short, quite distinct\nfrom theism. In this, Bosanquet brings to completion views\ncharacteristic of many of the nineteenth-century British idealist\nphilosophers (see Sweet 2014).\n\nWhile one finds religious belief and religious consciousness\nthroughout history and throughout the world, Bosanquet rejects the\nview that all religions are on a par. Religious consciousness has\nevolved, and higher forms of religion\u2014i.e., those which show a\nunity of the Divine and human nature\u2014are the more\n\u2018true\u2019. What Bosanquet is ultimately interested in, then,\nis religion in its highest or most developed form\u2014what Caird\ncalled \u201cAbsolute Religion\u201d. Though Bosanquet does not\ndevelop what, specifically, this means, his Gifford lectures give some\nhint as to the direction of his thought.\n\nDespite his criticisms of, and challenges to, Christianity, Bosanquet\nbelieved that the world had benefitted from Christian civilisation and\nculture, and that Christianity was a progress over earlier stages of\nreligion. Moreover, he not only frequently employed allusions to\nChristian religious belief and practice to illustrate his general\nviews, but retained elements from Christian doctrine, such as the\nideas of the atonement and of justification by faith\u2014though in a\nhighly modified form. The doctrines of the atonement (to which\nBosanquet often referred, using the words of Goethe, as \u2018dying\nin order to live\u2019) and of \u2018justification by faith\u2019\n(which emphasised the presence of religious consciousness in\n\u2018works\u2019) have a practical rather than a doctrinal\nsignificance. The former reflected the notion of\n\u2018self-sacrifice\u2019, involved in the achievement of\nself-realisation\u2014where one had to \u2018die\u2019 to the\ndesires of one\u2019s \u2018private will\u2019 in order to\n\u2018live\u2019 as a more complete moral agent. And the latter was\na reminder that one\u2019s actions could have a moral and spiritual\ncharacter only so far as they were carried out, out of a set of\n\u201cdominant ideas\u201d to which one was committed.\n\nGiven his explanation of what religion is, Bosanquet holds that\nreligion is entirely consistent with reason. He insists that religious\nbelief as a whole is not superstition, and that it is true so far as\nit is an expression of a \u201cnisus towards the whole\u201d\n(Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 98). Again, since\nparticular religious beliefs purport to be cognitive, they must, at\nleast in principle, be able to be known by believers and non-believers\nalike. (He is, however, sceptical about the relevance of traditional\napologetics.) In both cases, the standard that Bosanquet employs in\norder to assess truth in religion is the same as that which he uses to\nassess the truth in general\u2014namely, coherence.\n\nIn his 2006 The God of Metaphysics, T.L.S. Sprigge endorses a\nbroadly Bosanquetian account of religion, but raises a number of\ncriticisms of Bosanquet\u2019s account\u2014particularly concerning\nits implications for ethics. Sprigge argues, for example, that by his\nassimilation of evil into the Absolute, Bosanquet not only fails to\ntake evil seriously, but encourages passivity, assuming that evil is\neither inevitable or will eventually disappear on its own. The claim\nthat Bosanquet\u2019s absolute idealism entails such an attitude\ntowards evil seems difficult, however, to square with\nBosanquet\u2019s concern for public welfare and interest in social\nreform (see Sweet 2007). \n\nThough Bosanquet\u2019s analysis of religious belief reflects an\nunderstanding that, broadly speaking, was shared by a number of his\nfellow idealists, it is significantly different from other late\n19th century and early 20th century\nperspectives, such as those of William Clifford, John Henry Newman,\nand William James, and can be seen as an alternative to them. Given\nits immanentist character and insistence on separating religion or\nfaith from dogma and theology, it is close to the view of religion\nthat one finds in twentieth-century authors, such as R.B. Braithwaite,\nR.M. Hare, and W. Cantwell Smith. Bosanquet\u2019s views, like those\nof these authors, have been challenged (for example, by C.C.J. Webb,\nFran\u00e7ois Houang, and Alan P.F. Sell) for not only being\ninconsistent with any orthodox theism, but as presenting in its stead\na non-realist, generic religion (which, some critics hold, is not\nreligion at all). It is, however, important to recognise that\nBosanquet is not advancing a non-cognitivist or fideist view of\nreligion, and that he maintains that both religious belief as a whole\nand particular religious beliefs must meet appropriate rational\nstandards (see Sweet 2000).\n3.4 Aesthetics\n\nBosanquet\u2019s writings on art and aesthetics are not as well known\nas those of the third generation idealist, R.G. Collingwood\n(1889\u20131943) or of his Italian late contemporary Benedetto Croce\n(1866\u20131952). Yet Bosanquet was the author of the first history\nof aesthetics in English\u2014described by Monroe C. Beardsley as a\n\u201cpioneering work\u201d (1966: 14) that was the only\ncomprehensive study of aesthetics in English for half a\ncentury\u2014and he was referred to by the literary scholar and\nOxford Professor of Poetry, A.C. Bradley as \u201cthe only British\nphilosopher of the first rank who had dealt fully with this branch of\nphilosophy [i.e., aesthetics]\u201d (A.C. Bradley, p. 570).\n\nBosanquet had a life-long interest in the arts, and his writings are\nreplete with examples and illustrations taken from them. He read\nwidely, particularly poetry, from the classics to the moderns, and for\nseveral years served on the (London) Council of the Home Arts and\nIndustries Association. Among his early works was a translation of The\nIntroduction to Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Fine Art\n(1886)\u2014to which he wrote an important introduction\u2014and he\nwas the author of several articles on aesthetics, A History of\nAesthetic (1892), a series of lectures on aesthetics given to the\nLondon Ethical Society (1895\u201396), and Three Lectures on\nAesthetic (1915). \n\nBosanquet\u2019s aesthetics shows a debt to Hegel, to the Romantic\npoets, to the Arts and Crafts movement, and to the philosophy of\nHermann Lotze (1817\u20131881). Bosanquet was particularly inspired\nby Hegel\u2019s views on the function and the development of art, but\nhe was also influenced by the Romantic movement and its disciples\n(e.g., J.W. Goethe, F.W.J. Schelling, and William Wordsworth\u2014but\nalso S.T. Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Blake), a movement\nthat, interestingly, Hegel had disparaged. The Romantics\u2019\nemphasis on unity, the importance of art as a form of self-expression\nessential to the development of the self, and the organic conception\nof nature all have an important place in Bosanquet\u2019s work. But\nother Romantic themes were not adopted so readily. Bosanquet rejected\nany emphasis of emotion over reason, and he acknowledged the\nimportance of limits to art and to artistic activity in general. \n\nFor Bosanquet, art is revelatory of the \u2018spiritual\u2019\ncharacter of the world, and aesthetics is important because it is a\ndisciplined attempt to understand how artists and artworks contribute\nto this. Bosanquet\u2019s work in aesthetics focused on four\nprincipal issues: i) the nature and evolution of aesthetic\nconsciousness, ii) artistic production, iii) aesthetic\nappreciation\u2014particularly, the experience of beauty, ugliness,\nand the sublime in art, and iv) the role of art in the development of\ncharacter. Throughout, Bosanquet writes that he is simply following\nHegel\u2019s lead\u2014though his work is clearly a development\nrather than a repetition of Hegel\u2019s views. \n\nThe first issue, aesthetic consciousness, is discussed at length in\nBosanquet\u2019s A History of Aesthetic (and, to an extent,\nin his introductory essay to The Introduction to Hegel\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Fine Art). In A History of Aesthetic, for\nexample, Bosanquet describes the gradual recognition, over the course\nof European history, of art as a synthesis of content and expression.\nHe traces the continuity and \u2018interruption\u2019 in the\nunderstanding of art and the beautiful, from the classical Greek model\n(with its idea that \u201cart... is symbolic\u201d), through the\nmiddle ages, to the beginnings of a concrete synthesis in Schiller and\nGoethe, and then towards a \u201csynthesis of content and expression\nin that \u2018characteristic\u2019 which overmasters the mind and\nfeeling\u201d (History of Aesthetic, p. 458) which he finds\nin Ruskin\u2019s analysis of \u201cthe penetrative\nimagination\u201d. While Hegel had earlier held that there was a\ndevelopment in consciousness over time\u2014that at one point\nincludes aesthetic consciousness\u2014Bosanquet was not committed to\nthe Hegelian claim that aesthetic consciousness developed\ndialectically. \n\nFor Bosanquet, aesthetics is importantly connected to metaphysics;\nunderstanding art and the work of the artist requires a broader\nmetaphysical and logical theory. (It is this relation between the\nmetaphysical and the aesthetic, developed in Bosanquet\u2019s later\nwritings, that led Dorothy Emmet to write that Bosanquet\u2019s\nThree Lectures on Aesthetic was his \u201cmost successful\nbook\u201d [Emmet 1998: 28].) For Bosanquet, aesthetic experience was\ncharacteristic of the higher experiences we have that give us insight\ninto the full nature of reality, and features of such experiences were\nfeatures that one also finds in logic and metaphysics. Art, then, can\nhelp not only in understanding other aspects of the world, but by\nrevealing something of the \u201cspiritual\u201d character of the\nworld. \n\nThe second major issue that Bosanquet focused on was what is\u2014and\nwhat is involved in the production of\u2014a work of art. Here, too,\nBosanquet\u2019s treatment of this topic goes beyond Hegel\u2019s;\nit also anticipates elements later found in Collingwood and Croce.\n\n\nThe creation of a work of art, according to Bosanquet, is an\nexpression of spirit or feeling; some see Bosanquet as articulating a\nnascent expression theory of art. Yet Bosanquet held that there is\nalso a content communicated in a work of art, and so it is\n\u201crepresentative\u201d (Three Lectures, p.\n57)\u2014not in the sense of copying a natural object, but as\nembodying the \u2018soul\u2019 or essence of an object or a feeling\nin a new medium. (Here, Bosanquet is clearly influenced by\nHegel\u2019s view that beauty exists when the Idea is embodied in\nsensuous form.) While artists have some preconception of the effect\nthey wish to produce in the work of art, they also learn as they\nengage in the activity itself. A work of art, then, is a product of a\nprocess of expression, but this expression must normally be completed\nin an object in the \u2018physical\u2019 world. Thus, Bosanquet\ninsists, while a work of art originates in the subjective, it is also\nsomething objective. He writes: \n\n\nFeeling, [\u2026] in order to be capable of utterance in determinate\nform, must take on an objective character. (Value and Destiny of\nthe Individual, p. 43) \n\n\nWhile some have suggested that Bosanquet\u2019s account of the\nembodiment of a feeling in a work of art is unclear (Kobayashi 2009:\n166), Bosanquet would likely reply that such a concern is addressed by\nhis view that a work of art is a \u201cconcrete\nuniversal\u201d\u2014that it possesses an organisation and a unity\nthat shows a relation of interdependence among its parts, and it\npresents certain general principles in a concrete form. \n\nThe third principal issue that concerned Bosanquet is what happens\nwhen a person encounters a work of art, i.e., aesthetic appreciation.\nIn his Three Lectures on Aesthetic, Bosanquet analyses the\n\u201caesthetic attitude\u201d which, he says, is an activity not of\nthe mind alone, but of the whole\nperson\u2014\u201cbody-and-mind\u201d. (This issue of the connexion\nof body and mind is discussed at length in Lecture V of The\nPrinciple of Individuality and Value.) Although Bosanquet is an\nidealist, he is an objective idealist, and holds that, like\nperception, aesthetic experience involves the whole person. \n\nOn Bosanquet\u2019s view, the aesthetic attitude is\n\u201ccontemplative\u201d\u2014it is a \u201cpreoccupation with a\npleasant feeling, embodied in an object which can be\ncontemplated\u201d (Three Lectures, p. 10). But the work of\nart is also something in which the spectator finds his or her feelings\n\u201cexpressed\u201d. Bosanquet writes that when we\n\u201cimaginatively contemplate\u201d an art object, we are\n\u201cable [\u2026] to live in it as an embodiment of our\nfeeling\u201d (Three Lectures, p. 30); there is no ultimate\ndistinction between art and the feelings it evokes in us. Moreover,\nthe appreciation of a work of art requires understanding it as a whole\nor as a unity\u2014and so it must be organisational. This\norganisational character refers not only to elements or features\nwithin the art object itself, but to the environment in which the work\ncomes to be. Further, Bosanquet argued that art (and aesthetic\nconsciousness) have their basis only in a community. Art, then, is\nsocial and public\u2014so far as both the artist and the spectator\nare epistemically dependent on the communities in which they live.\n\n\nBosanquet\u2019s discussion of aesthetic appreciation in the\nThree Lectures also addressed such questions as the forms of\naesthetic satisfaction and the different \u201ckinds\u201d of\nbeauty\u2014beauty being understood as more than what is\naesthetically pleasing. It is here that most of the critical attention\nto his work (e.g., by John Dewey 1893) has been focussed. Bosanquet\nargues that while beauty is sometimes\n\u201ceasy\u201d\u2014accessible to and recognisable by\nall\u2014the excellence of certain beautiful items may be evident\nonly to those possessing \u201caesthetic insight\u201d. Because of\nthe \u201cintricacy\u201d or complexity of the components of a work\nof art, some might consider an aesthetically excellent object to be an\nugly one. This, Bosanquet writes, is a mistake. Ugliness is, Bosanquet\nargues, strictly speaking a failure in expression. Ugliness in art\nmust not be confused with \u201cdifficult art\u201d\u2014i.e., art\nthat is beautiful, though many may fail to appreciate it. (For a\nrecent discussion of \u2018difficulty\u2019 in art, see Perricone\n2018.) \n\nBosanquet\u2019s fourth principal concern in aesthetics was with the\nrole of art in the development of character. In several early essays\n(from 1886 to 1890), he emphasised how art leads to an expansion of\nthe self\u2014of the artist, in creating the work of art, but also of\nthe spectator, in appreciating the work. (Bosanquet followed William\nMorris and John Ruskin in holding that this result follows as much\nfrom \u201cartistic handiwork\u201d as from \u201cfine art\u201d.)\nIn the short term, aesthetic appreciation leads to a greater ability\nto appreciate not only art but life. But, as indicated earlier,\nBosanquet also maintains that in the long term\u2014here, agreeing\nwith Hegel\u2014art is a vehicle for the recognition of insights\nconcerning the unity of reality, and for an experience of something\ngreater than ourselves. \n\nWhile Bosanquet\u2019s aesthetics is close to the expression theory\nassociated with Collingwood and Croce, and while there is a continuity\nbetween Bosanquet\u2019s work and Collingwood\u2019s early studies\nin aesthetics, Bosanquet was a sharp critic of Croce. Bosanquet holds\nthat any adequate aesthetic theory must leave room for externality in\nart, and so he thinks that any theory that calls into question\n\u201cthe reality of the external world\u201d\u2014which he\nbelieves Croce\u2019s does\u2014cannot provide an accurate portrayal\nof the unity of the world. Bosanquet also challenges, for example, the\nclaim that art is prior to the conceptual and the philosophical. He\nargues that Croce ignores that \u201cthe aesthetic attitude is\nlearnt\u201d (\u201cCroce\u2019s \u00e6sthetic\u201d, in\nCollected Works, Vol. 1, p. 113), and that if language is just\nexpression, not only are logic and conceptual meaning are excluded\nfrom it, but we get a metaphysical \u201csingleness\u201d without\nsubstance, content, or \u201cdefinite meaning\u201d. Finally,\nBosanquet writes that Croce fails to provide an adequate statement of\nthe relation between the aesthetic, nature, and the metaphysical. By\nrestricting the aesthetic to the realm of art, Croce ignores the role\nthat the beauty of nature has in calling us \u201cout of\nourselves\u201d and to the recognition of what is real. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s account of the production of the work of art and the\nnature of aesthetic appreciation is arguably an advance on Hegel, not\nonly in the understanding of art and aesthetic experience as something\nmore than a prelude to Religion, but in re-situating them within the\nhistory of the development of consciousness. (Consequently, he denied\nwhat he saw to be the Crocean interpretation of Hegel: that, at some\npoint, art\u2014as uniquely expressing certain truths\u2014would\ncease to have a function, and be superseded by another form of\nconsciousness.) Moreover, Bosanquet\u2019s view that art is an\nexpression of emotion\u2014later articulated and developed by Croce\nand Collingwood\u2014may nevertheless be able to avoid some of the\ncriticisms raised against these later formulations. While Kobayashi\nhas argued that this account fails to explain how the aesthetic\nsentiment or feeling can be shared by the artist and spectators (2009:\n166), Bosanquet would likely respond that an explanation is to be\nfound in his account of the work of art as a concrete universal. Some\nstudies (e.g., by Morigi 2001) have suggested that there are insights\nwithin Bosanquet\u2019s work that warrant further investigation of\nidealist aesthetics, and others argue that Bosanquet\u2019s analyses\nof aesthetic judgement and aesthetic consciousness may plausibly bear\non other fields (e.g., politics) concerning matters related to self\nconsciousness and our relations to other persons. \n3.5 Social, Political, and Legal Philosophy\n\nBosanquet\u2019s social and political philosophy is called\n\u2018idealist\u2019 because of his view that social relations and\ninstitutions were not ultimately material phenomena, but best\nunderstood as existing in human consciousness. Writing largely in\nreaction to the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill and to the\nnatural-rights based theory of Herbert Spencer, Bosanquet\u2019s\nviews show both a strong influence of Hegel and an important debt to\nKant and to the classical Greek thought of Plato and Aristotle.\nIndeed, Bosanquet often spoke of his political theory as reflecting\nprinciples found in classical philosophy, and one of his early works\nwas a commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic. Nevertheless, his\npolitical thought lies clearly within the tradition of liberalism.\n\nThe main source for Bosanquet\u2019s social and political philosophy\nis The Philosophical Theory of the State (1899 [1923; Sweet\nand Gaus (ed.) 2001]; See Sweet 1997b), though many of his ideas are\ndeveloped in dozens of articles and essays which he wrote for\nprofessional academic journals, for publications of the Charity\nOrganisation Society and for the popular press. Like many of his\nfellow idealists (notably T.H. Green, D.G. Ritchie, William Wallace,\nJohn Watson, and, to a lesser degree, F.H. Bradley). Bosanquet\u2019s\nprincipal concern was to explain the basis of political authority and\nthe state, the place of the citizen in society, and the nature, source\nand limits of human rights. The political theory that he developed is\nimportantly related to his metaphysics and logic\u2014particularly to\nsuch notions as the individual, the general will, \u201cthe best\nlife\u201d, society, and the state. In order to provide a coherent\naccount of such issues, Bosanquet argued, one must abandon some of the\nassumptions of the liberal tradition\u2014particularly those that\nreveal a commitment to \u2018individualism\u2019.\n\nBosanquet saw authority and the state neither as based on individual\nconsent or a social contract, nor as mere products of a sovereign, but\nas part of the natural development of humanity, and as expressions of\nwhat he called the \u201creal\u201d or general will. On\nBosanquet\u2019s view, the will of the individual is \u201ca mental\nsystem\u201d whose parts\u2014\u201cideas or groups of\nideas\u201d\u2014are \n\n\nconnected in various degrees, and more or less subordinated to some\ndominant ideas which, as a rule, dictate the place and importance of\nthe others [i.e., of the other ideas that one has] (Bosanquet 1893\u201394,\np. 311). \n\n\nThus, Bosanquet writes that, \n\n\n[i]n order to obtain a full statement of what we will, what we want at\nany moment must at least be corrected and amended by what we want at\nall other moments. \n\n\nBut the process does not stop there. He continues: \n\n\nthis cannot be done without also correcting and amending it so as to\nharmonise it with what others want, which involves an application of\nthe same process to them. (1899 [1923; Sweet and Gaus (ed.) 2001]:\n133) \n\n\nIn other words, if we wish to arrive at an accurate statement of what\nour will is, we must be concerned not only with what we wish at some\nparticular moment, but also with all of the other wants, purposes,\nassociations and feelings that we and others have (or might have)\ngiven all of the knowledge available. The result is one\u2019s\n\u201creal\u201d or the \u201cgeneral will\u201d. Moreover, the\ndominant ideas characteristic of this real will provide a basis for\nshared understanding within the community and the state (see Sweet\n2019). Some have argued that the possibility of such an understanding\nprovides a basis not only for how language is a fundamental element in\npolitical community (see Grygienc 2018), but how it could be the\n\u201cmedium through which reality is given concrete shape\u201d\n(Lejeune 2018).\n\nBosanquet sees a relation between the \u201creal\u201d or\n\u2018general will\u2019 and the \u201ccommon good\u201d. He\nwrites that \u201cThe General Will seems to be, in the last resort,\nthe ineradicable impulse of an intelligent being to a good extending\nbeyond itself\u201d (op. cit., p. 127). This\n\u2018good\u2019 is nothing other than \u201cthe existence and the\nperfection of human personality\u201d which Bosanquet identified with\n\u201cthe excellence of souls\u201d and the complete realisation of\nthe individual. It is so far as the state reflects the general will\nand this common good that its authority is legitimate and its action\nmorally justifiable. Bosanquet describes the function of the state,\nthen, as \u201cthe hindrance of hindrances\u201d to human\ndevelopment. (op. cit., p. 189)\n\nThe influence of Rousseau and Hegel is clearly evident here (Sweet\n1991). Bosanquet saw in Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right a\nplausible account of the modern state as an \u201corganism\u201d or\nwhole united around a shared understanding of the good. Moreover, like\nHegel, he argued that the state, like all other social\n\u201cinstitutions\u201d, was best understood as an ethical idea and\nas existing at the level of consciousness rather than just material\nreality. Within nation states, Bosanquet held that the authority of\nthe state is absolute, because social life requires a consistent\nco-ordination of the activities of individuals and institutions.\n\nStill, although Bosanquet believed that the state was absolute, he did\nnot exclude the possibility of an organized system of international\nlaw (see Nicholson 1976). The conditions for an effective recognition\nand enforcement of such a system were, he thought, absent at that\nmoment\u2014though he held out hope that the League of Nations\nreflected the beginnings of the consciousness of a genuine human\ncommunity and that it might provide a mechanism by which multinational\naction could be accomplished.\n\nBecause the state can be said to reflect the general will that\nBosanquet claimed is also each individual\u2019s real will, Bosanquet\nheld (following Rousseau) that sometimes individuals can be required\nto engage in certain activities for their own good\u2014that is they\ncan be \u201cforced to be free\u201d. Moreover, he maintained that\nit is in terms of the \u2018common good\u2019 that one\u2019s\n\u201cstation\u201d or \u201cfunction\u201d in society is defined,\nand it is the conscientious carrying out of the duties that are\nattached to one\u2019s \u2018station\u2019 that constitutes ethical\nbehaviour. In fact, on Bosanquet\u2019s account, it is primarily in\nlight of one\u2019s service in the state that a person has the basis\nfor speaking of his or her personal identity. Not surprisingly, then,\nas Tyler (2006) points out, Bosanquet was frequently challenged by\nthose who claimed that he was anti-democratic and that his\nphilosophical views led to a devaluation of the individual. Such\nattacks ignore, however, Bosanquet\u2019s insistence on liberty as\nthe essence and quality of the human person and his emphases on the\nmoral development of the human individual and on limiting the state\nfrom directly promoting morality (which reflects both his own reading\nof Kant and the influence of Green\u2019s Kantianism.) Moreover,\nwhile Bosanquet did not hold that there were any a priori\nrestrictions on state action, he held that there were a number of\npractical conditions that did limit it. For example, while law was\nseen as necessary to the promotion of the common good, it could not\nmake a person good, and social progress could often be better achieved\nby volunteer action. (It is just this emphasis that Bosanquet found\nand defended in the approach to social work of the Charity\nOrganisation Society.)\n\nAlthough the state and law employ compulsion and restraint, they are\nconsidered to be \u2018positive\u2019 in that they provide the\nmaterial conditions for liberty, the functioning of social\ninstitutions, and the development of individual moral character. For\nBosanquet, then, there was no incompatibility between liberty and the\nlaw. Moreover, since individuals are necessarily social beings, their\nrights were neither absolute and inalienable, but reflected the\n\u201cfunction\u201d or \u201cpositions\u201d they held in the\ncommunity. For such rights to have not only moral but legal weight,\nBosanquet insisted that they had to be recognized by the state in law.\nStrictly speaking, then, there could be no rights against the state.\nNevertheless, Bosanquet acknowledged that, where social institutions\nwere fundamentally corrupt, even though there was no right to\nrebellion, there could be a duty to resist.\n\nIt is in his discussion of the nature, source, and limits of state\naction and of the nature of rights that Bosanquet introduces the topic\nof punishment. Bosanquet considers the three dominant theories of\npunishment\u2014retribution, reformation, and prevention\u2014and\nseems to find all defective; some have argued that, like Green, in the\nend Bosanquet does not offer a clear, consistent theory of punishment.\nYet Bosanquet writes that \u201c[t]he three main aspects of\npunishment [...] are really inseparable\u201d (1899 [1923; Sweet and\nGaus (ed.) 2001]: 215). Punishment is the response to an act of a bad\nwill\u2014and so it can be regarded as retributivist\u2014but it\nalso has a properly preventive element, as well as a reformatory\ncharacter (since \u201cthe aim of punishment is to make the offender\ngood\u201d (p. 206). The tension among these three theories has also\nled to the question of whether Bosanquet offers a \u201cunified\ntheory of punishment\u201d, and more recent scholarship, such as that\nof Brooks (2010), Crossley (2004), and Sweet (2000), all argue that\nthere is a way of reconciling the different theories, though they\ndisagree on the specifics of how that can occur. \n\nAlthough Bosanquet is sometimes regarded as a conservative, recent\nstudies have pointed out that he was an active Liberal and, in the\n1910s, supported the Labour Party. He insisted on the positive role\nthat the state can have in the promotion of social well being, he was\nin favour of worker ownership, he supported Irish Home Rule, and,\nduring the Second Boer War, was initially sympathetic to Boer\nindependence (see Sweet [1997]: 233\u2013234; for a nuanced recent account,\nsee Boucher [2020]: 325). It is also worth noting that\nBosanquet\u2019s audience was as much the professional social worker\nor the politician, as the philosopher. He was well-informed of the\npolitical situation in Britain, on the continent, and in the United\nStates. His interests extended to economics and social welfare, and\nhis work in adult education and social work provided a strong\nempirical dimension to his work. This background supplied him with a\nbroad base from which to reply to challenges from many of his\ncritics\u2014e.g., from philosophers, like Mill and Spencer, and from\nsocial reformers, such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb and the founder of\nthe Salvation Army, General William Booth. Despite charges that\nBosanquet\u2019s political philosophy is simplistic, inconsistent, or\nnaive, Adam Ulam notes that The Philosophical Theory of the\nState \n\n\nhas a comprehensiveness and an awareness of conflicting political and\nphilosophical opinions which give it a supreme importance in modern\npolitical thought. Bosanquet is both a political theorist and a\npolitical analyst. (Ulam 1951: 50) \n\n\nColin Tyler (2002) argues that Bosanquet\u2019s political thought can\nalso provide a basis for the recognition of cultural diversity suited\nto a liberal, multicultural society.\n\nIt has sometimes been suggested that the influences of Kant and Hegel\nlead to a tension in Bosanquet\u2019s political thought (see Vincent\n1982). Bosanquet\u2019s emphasis on the moral development of the\nhuman individual and on limiting the state from directly promoting\nmorality clearly reflects a Kantian influence. Moreover, Bosanquet\nbelieved that \u201cthe best life\u201d that he describes as the\n\u201cend\u201d of the individual and of the state alike,\napproximates what Kant referred to as \u201cthe kingdom of\nends\u201d. Even Bosanquet\u2019s justification of the authority of\nthe state can be seen as a reflection of a Kantian imperative that one\nwills the state as a necessary means to the moral end.\n3.6 Social Work and Adult Education\n\nSoon after his move to London, in 1881, Bosanquet joined his\nhalf-brother Charles, and his friend and former classmate C.S. Loch,\nin their work with the Charity Organisation Society (COS). This led to\na lifelong association with the COS\u2014one with which Bosanquet was\nindelibly connected. He was a Member of Council of the COS from 1898\nuntil his death, serving as Vice Chairman (1901\u20131915) and as\nChairman (1916\u20131917). He also served on Administration and\nDistrict Committees of the COS and was involved in the operation (and,\nfrom 1908\u20131912, served as Chairman of the Executive Council) of\nthe COS-sponsored School of Sociology and Social Economics from 1903\nuntil its incorporation into the London School of Economics in 1912.\n\n\nFor Bosanquet, social work needed to be connected with education and,\nby extension, educational reform. Through his cousin Mary C. McCallum,\nBosanquet learned about the Home Arts and Industries Association and\nits role in practical education and, starting in 1891, he frequently\nlectured and taught university extension courses for the London\nEthical Society (LES)\u2014initially under auspices of the University\nExtension Scheme at Essex Hall\u2014and its successor, the\nshort-lived London School of Ethics and Social Philosophy\n(1897\u20131900). Many of his publications, including The\nEssentials of Logic, A Companion to Plato\u2019s Republic\nfor English Readers, Psychology of the Moral Self, and\nThe Philosophical Theory of the State, were based on or were\nprepared as texts for these courses.\n\nBosanquet\u2019s lectures and essays on social topics deal not only\nwith general concerns on the role of social institutions and the state\nin promoting the good life, but on specific questions dealing with\nsocial reform. Many of these essays were published in the Charity\nOrganisation Review, but several were of a broad interest and\nappeared in leading philosophical and sociological journals and books.\nIn Essays and Addresses (1889), Bosanquet advances an\n\u201cideal of modern life\u201d which he calls \u201cChristian\nHellenism\u201d. There, in an essay entitled \u201cThe Kingdom of\nGod on Earth\u201d, he gives an analysis of the relation between the\nhuman individual and the community that was taken up later in his\npolitical philosophy. \n\nParticularly because of his COS work, Bosanquet was familiar with the\nempirical data on what was called \u201cthe social problem\u201d,\nand he made extensive concrete proposals for social reform; one finds\nexamples of this in \u201cIn Darkest England\u201d On the Wrong\nTrack (1891), his discussion and critique of Salvation Army\nGeneral William Booth\u2019s programme for the alleviation of\npauperism, and in Aspects of the Social Problem (1895), a\ncollection of essays which he edited and to which he contributed six\nof the 18 chapters. Bosanquet believed, however, that the key to\nsocial progress was the development of individual character. It was\nthis focus on character rather than social conditions that brought his\nviews into conflict with a number of reformers, including the Fabian\nsocial radicals, Sidney and Beatrice Webb. In particular, it led to\nthe accusation that Bosanquet\u2019s views were too individualistic\nand out of touch with the root of the problem of poverty (see Hobhouse\n1918: 78\u201379). This disagreement came to a head during the\nsessions of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws on which both Helen\nBosanquet and Beatrice Webb served. Some commentators have noted that,\nwhen one examines their specific suggestions on practical policy, the\ndifferences between the Bosanquets and their opponents are more often\nover strategy than principle.\n\nFor Bosanquet, education was not simply the acquisition of knowledge,\nbut of values; his involvement in adult education was inspired both by\nhis interest in bringing advanced formal education to a larger\npopulation that had a more extensive life experience than the typical\nundergraduate, but also by his views on art in the development of\ncharacter. While an adequate education requires having some\nunderstanding of general principles, it also involves moral and\naesthetic values. In his early writings, but also in his later work,\nBosanquet is particularly concerned with how such values can be\ninculcated.\n\nIn his two early essays on \u201cArtistic Handiwork in\nEducation\u201d (1887), Bosanquet argued for some form of handicraft\nwork being introduced into elementary and secondary education. This,\nBosanquet wrote, can contribute to the awakening, the enjoyment, and\nthe appreciation of beauty in nature and in art. Handicraft that has a\ndistinctively artistic character requires not only exertion through\nthe exercise of active apprehension, but also \u201cseeing\ndeeply\u201d into nature. Moreover, the study of works of art\nprovides a key to understanding both the culture and character of\nother nations but also universal human values.\n\nSimilar views on education can be discerned in Bosanquet\u2019s\nThe Education of the Young in \u2018The Republic\u2019 of\nPlato (1900), in his remarks on \u201cHow Could the Ethical\nEfficiency of Education be Increased?\u201d (1908), and in essays in\nSome Suggestions in Ethics (1918). In Some Suggestions in\nEthics, for example, Bosanquet distinguishes between\n\u201cignorance\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d. Ignorance is the\nintellectual state of not knowing facts. But, more problematic for\nBosanquet, is stupidity\u2014the \u201cinability to see\u201d or\nthe blindness to values\u2014for it either distorts, or reflects a\ndistortion of, one\u2019s \u201cideas concerning facts, objects and\ntruths\u201d (op. cit., p. 236). For Bosanquet, then,\neducation should be primarily directed at improving character; it is\nthe remedy for \u201cawakening interests and proportioning them to\nvalues\u201d (op. cit., p. 237). This, however, requires\neducational reform in schools\u2014concerning the atmosphere or tone\nof the school, the personality of the teachers, and the organisation\nof work and play. Through the social activities involved in\nparticipation\u2014particularly of the young\u2014in the arts or in\nartistic training, Bosanquet believed that society can facilitate both\nthe appreciation of beauty and moral excellence. \n4. General Assessment\n\nInterest in Bosanquet\u2019s work\u2014as with idealism as a\nwhole\u2014waned during the middle decades of the 20th\ncentury. Of the idealists, the writings of Bradley and, in political\ntheory, Green, are now much better known. There is no simple\nexplanation of this; many factors seem relevant.\n\nFirst, some of the work that made Bosanquet\u2019s reputation in his\ntime\u2014his popular essays, the books and articles that came out of\nhis university extension courses, and his involvement in social\npolicy\u2014now seems largely dated. Bosanquet\u2019s association\nwith the majority report of the Poor Law Reform Commission and his\nalleged championing of the nation state, led many to see him as a\nconservative if not reactionary thinker whose contributions to social\nand public policy, and to political philosophy, were outdated almost\nas soon as they had been published.\n\nIt has been suggested, as well, that some of the concepts central to\nBosanquet\u2019s work are problematic or not clearly defined, and\nthat several of his essays lack the logical rigor that one finds in\nmaterial destined for the more specialized audience of academic\nphilosophers. While insightful and wide ranging\u2014and while\naccessible to a much wider audience than the work of other idealists,\nsuch as Bradley and J.M.E. McTaggart\u2014Bosanquet\u2019s writings\nlack the sharpness, the density, and, at times, the outrageousness of\nthose of some of his contemporaries.\n\nIt is also fair to say that Bosanquet himself was an indifferent\nliterary stylist. His work often betrays a looseness that one tends to\nfind in texts based on lectures prepared for general audiences or for\nclasses, and he wrote that \u201cI usually rush my books, I get so\ntired of them\u201d (Muirhead 1935: 131). His early work on logic was\nalso remarked upon for its \u201cstiffness\u201d (ibid., p.\n58). But these primarily stylistic issues may also be a consequence of\nBosanquet\u2019s refusal to sever philosophical analysis from the\nexperience which Bosanquet was trying to investigate.\n\nThere are other reasons that no doubt contributed to the decline of\ninterest in Bosanquet\u2019s work. By the early part of the\n20th century, philosophical idealism as a whole was seen by\nmany as a philosophical dead-end, with figures such as G.E. Moore,\nBertrand Russell, and A.J. Ayer challenging what they saw as its\nirredeemably obscure vocabulary, as well as its questionable\nunderlying speculative metaphysics.\n\nNevertheless, the influence and legacy of Bosanquet, and of British\nidealism in general, should not be underestimated. \n\nOne area in which today one sees a resonance or legacy is in political\nand social thought; Bosanquet\u2019s arguments have been seen as at\nleast close\u2014or even a preferred alternative\u2014to the work of\nsome contemporary communitarians. Bosanquet\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance of a common good, on the social character of the\nindividual, and on the fundamental place of substantive social ends\nwithin a community, are echoed in the more recent writings of Charles\nTaylor (1992) and Alasdair MacIntyre (1990). Other authors (such as\nGerald Gaus [1983, 1994, 2001]) see in Bosanquet\u2019s work a model\nof a substantive liberalism.\n\nA second area that is beginning to be explored is that of\nBosanquet\u2019s relation to philosophers of succeeding generations\nin Britain, such as R.G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott.\nCollingwood, for example, discusses Bosanquet\u2019s political\nphilosophy in his unpublished \u201cNotes Towards a Theory of\nPolitics as a Philosophical Science\u201d (see Connelly 2002), and\nOakeshott regarded The Philosophical Theory of the State as\n\u201cthe only theory which has paid thoroughgoing attention to all\nthe problems which must be considered by a theory of the State\u201d\n(Oakeshott 1936).\n\nOther areas that have been the subject of some recent study are\nBosanquet\u2019s views on religion and on logic. Bosanquet is known\nto have had an influence on the \u2018social gospel\u2019 of the\nEnglish theologian and future Archbishop of Canterbury, William\nTemple. More broadly, Bosanquet\u2019s emphasis on the moral, and not\ndoctrinal, character of religious belief is, as noted earlier,\nreflected in recent work in the study of religion. While many accept\nthe standard view that idealist logic was problematic and no rival for\nthe later logic of Russell and Wittgenstein, it bears noting that,\ngiven Bosanquet\u2019s view of the centrality of logic to philosophy,\nhe engaged and debated then-current developments in logic, such as\nthat of Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, and Russell. For example, in\nthe posthumously published Three Chapters on the Nature of\nMind (1923), Bosanquet closely examines Russell\u2019s account\nin The Analysis of Mind, claiming that there were many points\non which both were in agreement, and that Russell\u2019s view was not\nso much wrong as \u201ctoo narrow\u201d. It has also been argued\nthat Bosanquet\u2019s views on logic and scientific method are close\nto those of some contemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural\nlaws. \n\nJust as the recent exploration of the origins of analytic philosophy\nhave led some authors to look more closely at its relations with\nBritish idealism, the intellectual roots of Bosanquet\u2019s idealism\nalso need to be more thoroughly explored. Though Bosanquet\u2019s\ndebt to the writings of Hegel and Kant is relatively well-known, there\nwere a number of other important influences on his work (see Sweet\n1995). Perhaps the most significant is that of classical Greek\nthought, and it is only recently recognised that Bosanquet\u2019s\nphilosophy cannot be fully appreciated without am appreciation of his\ndebt to Greek philosophy.\n\nFinally, even as Bosanquet\u2019s influence, and that of British\nidealism as a whole, diminished at home, they continued for some time\nafterward in other countries of the English-speaking world. Thus,\naside from the \u2018third generation\u2019 of idealists or\nidealist-influenced philosophers in Britain (such as Collingwood,\nMichael Oakeshott, and Dorothy Emmet), Bosanquet\u2019s thought also\nhad an impact in English-language philosophy in Canada (with John\nWatson), in South Africa (with R.F.A. Hoernl\u00e9 (see Sweet 2010),\nA.R. Lord (see Sweet 2005), and Andrew Murray), and in India (with\nHiralal Haldar, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and Benoy Ray) (see Sweet\n2011). \n\nIn recent years, then, there has been a renewed interest in\nBosanquet\u2019s work\u2014particularly concerning his philosophical\nand social thought. Given the number of studies published during the\npast forty years on Hegel, Green and, more recently, Bradley, and\ngiven the reevaluation of the significance of the work of British\nidealism and its place in the history of philosophy, there has been a\nsteady reconsideration of the contribution of Bosanquet\u2019s\nphilosophy as well.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a id=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\nThe most comprehensive list to date of Bosanquet\u2019s work is found\nin Vol. 1 of <em>Essays in Philosophy and Social Policy,\n1883\u20131922</em>, (ed.
