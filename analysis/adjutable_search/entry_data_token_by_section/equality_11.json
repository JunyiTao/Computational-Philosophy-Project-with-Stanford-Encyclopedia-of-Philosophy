    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Equality of Resources\n3.5 Equality of Resources\n\nRepresented above all by both Rawls and Dworkin, resource equality\navoids such problems (Rawls 1971; Dworkin 1981b). It holds individuals\nresponsible for their decisions and actions, but not for circumstances\nbeyond their control, such as race, sex, skin-color, intelligence, and\nsocial position, thus excluding these as distributive criteria. Equal\nopportunity is insufficient because it does not compensate for unequal\ninnate gifts. What applies for social circumstances should also apply\nfor such gifts, as both are purely arbitrary from a moral point of\nview.\n\nAccording to Rawls, human beings should have the same initial\nexpectations of \u201cbasic goods,\u201d i.e., all-purpose goods;\nthis in no way precludes ending up with different quantities of such\ngoods or resources, as a result of personal economic decisions and\nactions. When prime importance is accorded an assurance of equal basic\nfreedoms and rights, inequalities are just when they fulfill two\nprovisos: on the one hand, they have to be linked to offices and\npositions open to everyone under conditions of fair equality of\nopportunity; on the other hand, they have to reflect the famous\n\u2018difference principle\u2019 in offering the greatest possible\nadvantage to the least advantaged members of society (Rawls 1993, p. 5\nf.; 1971, \u00a7 13). Otherwise, the economic order requires revision.\nDue to the argument of the moral arbitrariness of talents, the\ncommonly accepted criteria for merit (like productivity, working\nhours, effort) are clearly relativized. The difference principle only\nallows the talented to earn more to the extent this raises the lowest\nincomes. According to Rawls, with regard to the basic structure of\nsociety, the difference principle should be opted for under a\nself-chosen \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d regarding personal and\nhistorical circumstances and similar factors: the principle offers a\ngeneral assurance of not totally succumbing to the hazards of a free\nmarket situation; and everyone does better than with inevitably\ninefficient total equal distribution, whose level of well-being is\nbelow that of those worst off under the difference principle.\n\nSince Rawls\u2019 Theory of Justice is the classical focal point\nof present-day political philosophy, it is worth noting the different\nways his theory claims to be egalitarian. First, Rawls upholds a\nnatural basis for equal human worth: a minimal capacity for having a\nconception of the good and a sense of justice. Second, through the\ndevice of the \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d people are conceived as\nequals in the \u201coriginal position.\u201d Third, the idea of\nsharing this \u201coriginal position\u201d presupposes the parties\nhaving political equality, as equal participants in the process of\nchoosing the principles by which they would be governed. Fourth, Rawls\nproposes fair equality of opportunity. Fifth, he maintains that all\ndesert must be institutionally defined, depending on the goals of the\nsociety. No one deserves his or her talents or circumstances, which\nare products of the natural lottery. Finally, the difference principle\ntends toward equalizing holdings. However, it is important to keep in\nmind, as Scheffler (2003) has pointed out, that the main focus of\nRawls\u2019 theory is justice as such; it is only secondarily about an\negalitarian conception of justice. In addition, since the primary\nsubject is the basic structure, pure procedural justice has priority\nover distributive or allocative justice Equality is not the only or\nsingle value for Rawls.\n\nDworkin\u2019s equality of resources (1981b), on the other hand, is\nconcerned with equality as such. His theory stakes a claim to being\neven more \u2018ambition- and endowment-insensitive\u2019 than\nRawls\u2019 theory. Unequal distribution of resources is considered fair\nonly when it results from the decisions and intentional actions of\nthose concerned. Dworkin proposes a hypothetical auction in which\neveryone can accumulate bundles of resources through equal means of\npayment, so that in the end no one is jealous of another\u2019s bundle (the\nenvy test). The auction-procedure also offers a way to precisely\nmeasure equality of resources: the measure of resources devoted to a\nperson\u2019s life is defined by the importance of the resources to others\n(Dworkin 1981b, p. 290). In the free market, how the distribution then\ndevelops depends on an individual\u2019s ambitions. The inequalities that\nthus emerge are justified, since one has to take responsibility for\nhow one\u2019s choices turn out (i.e., one\u2019s \u201coption luck\u201d) in\nthe realm of personal responsibility. In contrast, unjustified\ninequalities based on different innate provisions and gifts, as well\nas on brute luck, should be compensated for through a fictive\ndifferentiated insurance system: its premiums are established behind\nDworkin\u2019s own \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d in order to then be\ndistributed in real life to everyone and collected in taxes. For\nDworkin, this is the key to the natural lottery being balanced fairly,\npreventing a \u201cslavery of the talented\u201d through excessive\nredistribution.\n",
