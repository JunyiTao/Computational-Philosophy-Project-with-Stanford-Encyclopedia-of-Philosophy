    "main_text": "Action Theory\n4. Action Theory\n\nAnscombe\u2019s Intention is one of the classics of 20th\ncentury philosophy. Indeed, it continues to be a standard point of\nreference for those working in action theory and philosophical\npsychology, so much so that contemporary theories of action are often\ncategorized as either Anscombean or Davidsonian.\n\nOn its back cover, David Velleman aptly quips that Intention\nis \u201coften quoted, sometimes read, rarely understood\u201d. Many\nreaders are indeed puzzled by the significance and the lessons of what\nshe writes. Intention is a work on the nature of agency\nthrough an understanding of the concept of intention. As we saw above,\nAnscombe wrote Intention after opposing supporters of\nTruman:\n\nPerplexed by defenders of Truman she came to the conclusion that they\nhad failed to understand the nature of his actions, and it was this\nthat led her to write Intention, in which she pointed out\nthat in doing one thing (moving one\u2019s hand) one may\nintentionally be doing another (directing the death of human beings).\n(Haldane 2000, 1020)\n\n\nIndeed we have seen many points in her work in moral philosophy where\nshe calls us to understand the concepts of action and of intention\nbetter.\n\nThe best way to understand the argument of the book might be to\nconsider its claims in a different order than the way the book lays\nthem out. For the actual narrative of the books deliberately leads the\nreader into a bunch of dead ends and incomplete solutions before\nforwarding specific positive claims.\n\nIn what might reasonably be considered to be the conclusion of the\nbook\u2019s argument, she writes that \u201cthe term\n\u2018intentional\u2019 has reference to a form of\ndescription of events\u201d (INT, 84). To unpack this cryptic\nthought, note first that the events she has in mind are some of those\nthat we human beings are the subject of. It does not pick out things\nthat merely happen to us.\n\nSecond, note that a single action can be described in various ways. Is\nhe moving his arm up and down? Pumping water? Doing his job? Clicking\nout a steady rhythm? Making a funny shadow on the rock behind him?\nWell, it could be that all of these descriptions are\ntrue.\n\nThird, note that even if the same action can be described in multiple\nways, it usually won\u2019t be intentional in every one of those ways\ndescribed. For example, even though a man is pumping water\nintentionally, he might not be making a funny shadow on the rock\nbehind him intentionally. But what determines which of the\ndescriptions of his action are indeed intentional?\n\nAt first, Anscombe answers this disjunctively: she identifies several\ncases which are not intentional, and several other cases that\nare. If you ask someone \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d, and\nthey give one of a few types of answers, this establishes that the\naction is not intentional. Such ways of answering can include 1)\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was doing that.\u201d, 2) \u201cI\n(merely) observed/inferred that I was doing that\u201d, 3) \u201cI\n(merely) observed/inferred how my physical movement was caused.\u201d\nBy contrast, the following answers show that the action so described\nis indeed intentional: 1) an answer that mentions something future\n(\u201cTo end the war\u201d), 2) an answer that interprets it\n(\u201cOut of curiosity\u201d) , 3) an answer that mentions\nsomething past that\u2019s given as the ground for something good or\nbad for the person at whom it is aimed (\u201cThey attacked us\nfirst\u201d), or, finally, 4) \u201cNo reason\u201d (INT, 24).\n\nSuch a hodgepodge of answers sheds little light upon the concept of\nintention, her quarry. Thus, she shifts methods. She emphasizes that\nin every case of doing something intentionally, you don\u2019t need\nto observe yourself in order to know that that\u2019s what you are up\nto. For example, you know that you are reading this encyclopedia\nentry, and you know this not because somebody told you, nor did you\nmerely infer it, nor did you see yourself in a mirror reading it.\nRather, you know it in some distinctive way, what later writers will\ncall a \u2018first-personal\u2019 way. Anscombe calls this knowledge\nof one\u2019s own intentional actions \u201cpractical\nknowledge\u201d, which is likewise obscure. But she concludes that\n\u201cthe notion of \u2018practical knowledge\u2019 can only be\nunderstood if we first understand \u2018practical\nreasoning\u2019\u201d (INT, 57). Thus it is only by grasping what it\nis to reason practically that we will understand what practical\nknowledge and the concept of intention are.\n\nWhat, then, is practical reasoning? There are two ways to think about\nit. One familiar way is via deliberation: we have some end, and we\nreason to some sufficient means to that end. Aristotle sketched things\nthis way. Anscombe focuses on another way (although it winds up being\nequivalent to the first). She notes that the various ways to describe\nwhat someone does can bear a particular order to one another.\nA man might be moving his arm up and down because (and not\njust, and) he is operating the pump, which he\u2019s doing because\n(and not just, and) he\u2019s pumping water to the house, and so on.\nThis is an order that really exists among events; it\u2019s not\nmerely the sum of merely physically described events going on in the\nworld and, also somehow, what\u2019s going on in his head.\nThis order is the order of intention.\n\nOf course, the man himself is in a special position to grasp this\nactually-existing order among the ways of describing what he\u2019s\ndoing. Anscombe compared this knowledge to the knowledge had by a man\nwho directs a project like the erection of a building simply by giving\norders for every little thing that anyone does, a project which he\ncan\u2019t see and gets no reports on. If all goes well, the director\nknows what\u2019s done, and his knowledge is practical knowledge. His\npractical knowledge is his grasping the order of the events that\nunfold. Practical knowledge, then, isn\u2019t fundamentally knowledge\nof certain atomic actions, e.g. thinking of a number, blinking.\nIt\u2019s knowledge of the entire means-end order among the things\none does, an order which of course includes the actions\nconstituting it. The man in the earlier example can say\n\u201cI\u2019m moving my arm up and down\u201d because he\ncan say \u201cI\u2019m moving my arm up and down because I\u2019m\npumping water\u201d.\n\nIndeed, many of the very concepts we use to describe movements\ninvolving human beings \u2013 e.g. \u2018greeting\u2019,\n\u2018hiring\u2019, \u2018sending for\u2019, even\n\u2018offending\u2019, \u2018dropping\u2019, \u2018placing\u2019\n\u2013 are concepts we\u2019d lack were we to lack the concept of\nintention. So the term \u2018intentional\u2019 refers not only to\nthe aforementioned \u2018because\u2019 and what it structures, but\nto the very terms by which we conceptualize most human and animal\nmovement. Intention is thus not something \u2018added\u2019 on to\nmere behavior we somehow first separately conceptualize. Rather, the\norder of intention is baked into the ways we represent our lives from\nthe very start.\n\nThere are a wealth of other sections from Intention that have\nbeen \u201coften quoted\u201d and yet \u201crarely\nunderstood\u201d. Consider, for example, this famous passage:\n\nLet us consider a man going round a town with a shopping list in his\nhand. Now it is clear that the relation of this list to the things he\nactually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him the list\nor it is his own list; and that there is a different relation where a\nlist is made by a detective following him about. If he made the list\nitself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it to him,\nit has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation to\nwhat happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by\nthe record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the\nman actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes\na mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man\u2019s\nperformance (if his wife were to say: \u201cLook, it says butter and\nyou have bought margarine\u201d, he would hardly reply: \u201cWhat a\nmistake! we must put that right\u201d and alter the word on the list\nto \u201cmargarine\u201d); whereas if the detective\u2019s record\nand what the man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in\nthe record. (INT, 56).\n\n\nAnscombe draws attention to the fact that when there is a discrepancy\nbetween a piece of paper and what happens, the source of the error\ndepends upon the \u201crole\u201d of the paper. If the paper has the\nrole of a record, the error is in the paper. But if the paper has the\nrole of an order or intention, the error is in what happens. Thus\nthere can be two ways to fail to know what happens: by\nmisrecording, and by misperforming. And one who practically knows\ndoesn\u2019t misperform.\n\nBeginning with Searle (1975), a different thesis gets very widely\nattributed to Anscombe in the literature: one about \u2018mental\nstates\u2019 like beliefs and desires, each of which supposedly has a\ndifferent \u201cdirection of fit\u201d. Anscombe, however, says\nnothing here about believing or desiring or other kinds of mental\nstates; the example instead displays two ways of knowing. Her\npoint is that you can know something either by believing something\nthat is (already) true, or by intentionally doing something. Both are\nforms of knowledge, and indeed there can be two ways to know one and\nthe same thing. (See Frost 2014.)\n\nAnscombe applied her views on intention to clarify her own positions\non controversial claims, such as the condemnation of contraception.\nOne puzzle in the Catholic doctrine condemning contraception, and yet\nallowing for the \u2018rhythm method\u2019 of avoiding pregnancy, is\nto reconcile the rationales in a consistent way. Many charged the\nChurch with inconsistency, since the intention to not get pregnant\nduring intercourse is present in both cases. Anscombe claims there is\nan important difference:\n\nThe reason why people are confused about intention, and why they\nsometimes think there is no difference between contraceptive\nintercourse and the use of infertile times to avoid conception, is\nthis: They don\u2019t notice the difference between\n\u201cintention\u201d when it means the intentionalness of the thing\nyou\u2019re doing \u2013 that you\u2019re doing this on\npurpose \u2013 and when it means a further or\naccompanying intention with which you do the thing.\n(CAC, 182)\n\n\nHer claim is that the further intentions that accompany these actions\nmay be the same, but there is a significant difference between the\nacts themselves. Her claim is that contraceptive intercourse, unlike\ntiming intercourse to coincide with infertile periods, is a bad sort\nof action because in the case of contraceptive intercourse\n\u201c\u2026to intend such an act is not to intend a marriage act\nat all, whether or not we\u2019re married\u201d (CAC, 183). Having\nintercourse that has purposely been rendered infertile is itself a\ndifferent act from having intercourse at an infertile time. Even\nthough both types of action may have the further aim of, for example,\nlimiting family size, the acts themselves differ. The\n\u201cperversion of the sex act in marriage is, in this one way, like\nwriting a forged check for a good cause\u201d, she claims. The\nfurther intention of, let\u2019s say, helping the needy is a worthy\none but does not vindicate the action of forging the check.\n\nNeedless to say, this view was controversial. Bernard Williams and\nMichael Tanner criticized her argument for failing to consider one of\nher own theses \u2013 that actions, including sorts of actions, can\nfall under a variety of descriptions. On their view, she is picking\nand choosing descriptions of actions in order to get the outcome she\nwants \u2013 a distinction between the rhythm method and\ncontraception that isn\u2019t just a trivial distinction. But, they\nargue, she cannot do this convincingly. They argue that couples who\nemploy the rhythm method are taking steps to achieve infertility just\nas those who take contraception are. Those steps are central to\nunderstanding the acts themselves, not simply the further purpose of\nthe acts. (Williams and Tanner 1972)\n",
