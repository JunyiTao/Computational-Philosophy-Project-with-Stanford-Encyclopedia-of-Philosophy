Others deny\nthis. Many opponents of pervasive context-sensitivity rely heavily on\npragmatics and speech act theory to explain away the phenomena that\nothers take to be evidence for pervasive context-sensitivity. For\nexample, Bach (2001) and Soames (2009) argue that quantifier phrases\nare context-insensitive. The content of \u2018every\nstudent\u2019, in all contexts, quantifies over absolutely all\nstudents. So, the content \u2018Every student has a pencil\u2019, in\nall contexts, is equivalent to the content of \u2018Every student\nin the entire universe has a pencil\u2019. But Bach and\nSoames say that speakers who utter that sentence almost always\nmean, convey, or assert a proposition other\nthan the content of the sentence. When Smith utters \u2018Every\nstudent has a pencil\u2019 he asserts or means that every student\nin Smith\u2019s first-grade class has a pencil (or some\nsimilar proposition), though this is not the content of the sentence in\nhis context. Cappelen and Lepore (2005) similarly hold that\n\u2018tall\u2019 is context-insensitive. The content of \u2018Mary\nis tall\u2019, in every context, is simply the proposition that Mary\nis tall, with no relativization to a property (or scale or comparison\nclass). However, a speaker who utters that sentence usually asserts or\nmeans a richer proposition, such as that Mary is tall for a\nphilosopher. For discussions of related views, see Bach 1994,\nCarston 2002, Borg 2007, Recanati 2004, Gauker 2012, Braun 2012.\n\n\nOther theorists resist pervasive context-sensitivity by appealing to\nshiftiness in extension without shiftiness in content. To obtain\nshiftiness in extension without shiftiness in content, these theorists\nrelativize extensions of expressions to non-traditional\nparameters. Such views are often called relativist. For\nexample, Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane (2011)\nargue for relativist theories of epistemic uses of \u2018might\u2019.\nOn their views, \u2018Susan might be in Boston\u2019, when used\nepistemically, has the same content in all contexts, but the\ntruth-value of this content varies not only from one possible world to\nanother, but also from one body of knowledge to another within a single\npossible world. Lasersohn (2005) similarly argues that predicates of\npersonal taste, such as \u2018tasty\u2019 and \u2018fun\u2019, do\nnot vary in content from context to context, but do vary in extension\nwith respect to judges, or standards of taste, within\na single world.
