    "main_text": "The First Incompleteness Theorem || Representability\n2.2 Representability\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof also requires the notion of representability\nof sets and relations in a formal system \\(F\\). More precisely, two\nrelated notion are needed.\n\nA set \\(S\\) of natural numbers is strongly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\) if there is a formula\n\\(A(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) with one free variable\n\\(x\\) such that for every natural number\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{n} \\in S &\\Rightarrow F \\vdash A(\\underline{n}); \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{n} \\not\\in S &\\Rightarrow F \\vdash \\neg A(\\underline{n}),\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nA set \\(S\\) of natural numbers is weakly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\) if there is a formula\n\\(A(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) such that for every\nnatural number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{n} \\in S \\Leftrightarrow F \\vdash A(\\underline{n}).\n\\]\n\n\nIt is obvious how all these notions are generalized to many-place\nrelations. There are also related notions of representability for\nfunctions. As the incompleteness results in particular teach us, there\nare sets which are only weakly but not strongly representable (the key\nexample being the set of statements provable in the system).\n\n[Warning: Here the terminology in the literature\nvaries a lot: \u201cstrongly represent\u201d is sometimes called,\ne.g., \u201crepresent\u201d, \u201cnumeralwise express\u201d,\n\u201cbi-numerate\u201d, \u201cdefine\u201d or \u201cstrongly\ndefine\u201d; \u201cweakly represent\u201d is in turn also\nexpressed, e.g., by \u201crepresent\u201d, \u201cdefine\u201d,\n\u201cweakly define\u201d, or \u201cnumerate\u201d. One should be\ncareful here and focus on the relevant definitions, and not let the\nwords mislead.]\n\nIn the case of both kinds of representability (weak and strong), there\nis always a simple existential \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula,\nwhich (weakly or strongly) represents the set in question, and usually\nsuch a formula is used to represent \\(S\\).\n\nThough these notions are relative to the formal system, it has turned\nout that strong and weak representability are extremely stable. Quite\nindependently of the particular formal system chosen, exactly the\ndecidable, or recursive, sets (relations) are strongly representable,\nand exactly the semi-decidable, or recursively enumerable sets\n(relations) are weakly representable. This holds for all formalized\nsystems which contain Robinson arithmetic Q, from\nRobinson arithmetic itself to the strongest axioms systems of set\ntheory like ZFC and beyond (as long as they are\n(recursively) axiomatizable). Instead of using the notion of\n\u201crepresentability\u201d, G\u00f6del took a different approach\nby speaking of sets being \u201cdecidable in a formal system\n\\(F\\)\u201d (\u201centscheidungsdefinit\u201d). If the\nproofs of \\(F\\) are systematically generated, it will be eventually\ndetermined, for any given number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\), whether it\nbelongs to \\(S\\) or not\u2014given that \\(S\\) is strongly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\). \n\nIn sum, we have:\n\nThe Representability Theorem\n\nIn any consistent formal system which contains Q:\n\n\nA set (or relation) is strongly representable if and only if it is\nrecursive;\nA set (or relation) is weakly representable if and only if it is\nrecursively enumerable.\n\n\n\nBoth notions of representability\u2014strong and weak\u2014must be\nclearly distinguished from mere definability (in the standard\nsense of the word). A set \\(S\\) is definable in the language\nof arithmetic if there is a formula \\(A(x)\\) in the language\nsuch that \\(A(\\underline{n})\\) is true in the standard structure\nof natural numbers (the intended interpretation) if and only if\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n} \\in S.\\) There are many sets which\ncan be defined in the language of arithmetic but not (even weakly)\nrepresented in any \\(F\\), such as the set of consistent formulas,\nthe set of sentences unprovable in the system \\(F\\), or the set of\nDiophantine equations with no solutions (see below).\n",
