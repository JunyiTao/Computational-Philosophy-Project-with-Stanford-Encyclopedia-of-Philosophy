    "main_text": "The Justifications for Precedent\n3. The Justifications for Precedent\n\n\nMost discussions of precedent focus on the justifications for having a\ndoctrine of stare decisis by which later courts are bound to\nfollow earlier decisions. There is, of course, a prior question of why\nthe decisions of courts should be regarded as making law at\nall. In some Civilian legal systems, such as the French, the official\nview is that court decisions do not make law, they merely involve the\napplication of the law. This follows from a straightforward\nunderstanding of the separation of powers: the responsibility of the\nlegislator is to make law, the responsibility of the judiciary is to\nfaithfully apply the law made by the legislator. For the courts to\nmake law would be to usurp the legislative function, and to usurp a\nfunction to which the courts have no legitimate claim. One distinctive\nfeature of Common Law systems is the existence of central areas of law\nthat have no legislative foundations\u2014such as contract, tort,\ntrusts, and personal property. All of these areas have seen\nlegislative intervention, but most Common Law jurisdictions still\nleave them on a non-statutory footing. Here the decisions of the\ncourts are the basis of the law.\n\n\nIn practice no modern legal system has functioned without the\ndecisions of the courts playing at least an auxiliary role in settling\nthe content of the law. To take one well-known example, in France the\nlaw of civil wrongs (torts, delicts) is based upon five relatively\nshort articles of the Code Civil (\u00a7\u00a7\n1382\u20131386). Formally, the law is found in those five articles,\nand a court decision is legally flawed if it does not cite at least\none of them as the basis for its ruling. But there is a vast body of\ncases interpreting and applying those articles, and these cases are\nregularly cited before the courts to assist them in reaching their\ndecisions, even though judgments themselves do not mention earlier\ncases. In substance, then, if not in form, this area is partly\nconstituted by judge-made law.\n\n\nSo one question that can be raised about precedent is why it is\njustifiable for the decisions of courts to be treated in this way at\nall, i.e., for them to help constitute the law. There is a more\nspecialised question, however. In the Common Law at least, the\ndoctrine of stare decisis requires later courts to follow\nearlier decisions even if they were wrongly decided. To say that a\ncase was \u2018wrongly decided\u2019 is to say that the legally\npermissible reasons relevant to the case did not, all things\nconsidered, support the conclusion reached by the court. It should be\nemphasised that such a conclusion depends upon and is relative to the\ncontext provided by existing legal doctrine. Take the question of\nwhether parents should be able to recover for the cost of raising a\nhealthy child when it has been born as a result of a negligently\nperformed sterilisation operation on one of the parents. In some legal\nsystems such costs are recoverable, whereas in others they are\nnot. Here it is quite possible that these conflicting decisions are\nboth correct, in the sense that each is correct within its own\ndoctrinal context. So whether a decision is wrong is not a question of\nhow the case ought to be decided without any reference to the law, but\nwhether it goes against the merits of the legally relevant\nreasons.\n\n\nThe doctrine of precedent thus raises two justificatory issues: (a)\nwhy treat court decisions as partly constituting the law, and (b) why\nrequire later courts to follow erroneous decisions of earlier\n courts?[14]\n The most influential arguments responding to these issues are based\nupon considerations of:\n\nconsistency\nexpectations\nreplicability\nthe need for law-making\n\n\n\n(For general discussions of the justification for precedent, see:\nSchauer 1987, 595\u2013602, Golding 1984, 98\u2013100, Benditt 1987,\n89\u201393.)\n",
