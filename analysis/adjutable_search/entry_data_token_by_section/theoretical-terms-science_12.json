    "main_text": "Formal Accounts || Defining Theoretical Terms\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe idea that there are scientific terms whose meaning is determined\nby a scientific theory goes back to Duhem and Poincar\u00e9. Such\nterms came to be referred to as theoretical terms in\ntwentieth century philosophy of science. Properties and entities that\nare observable in the sense of direct, unaided perception did not seem\nto depend on scientific theories as forces, electrons and nucleotides\ndid. Hence, philosophers of science and logicians set out to\ninvestigate the semantics of theoretical terms. Various formal\naccounts resulted from these investigations, among which the Ramsey\nsentence by Ramsey ([1929] 1931), Carnap\u2019s notion of indirect\ninterpretation (1939; 1958) and Lewis\u2019s (1970) proposal of\ndefining theoretical terms are the most prominent ones. Though not all\nphilosophers of science understand the notion of a theoretical term in\nsuch way that semantic dependence upon a scientific theory is\nessential, this view prevails in the literature.\n\nThe theory-observation distinction has been attacked heavily and is\npresumably discredited by a large number of philosophers of science.\nStill, this distinction continues to permeate a number of important\nstrands in the philosophy of science, such as scientific realism and\nits alternatives and the logical analysis of scientific theories. A\ncase in point is the recent interest in the Ramsey account of\nscientific theories which emerged in the wake of Worral\u2019s\nstructural realism (cf. Ladyman 2009). We have seen, moreover, that\nthe formal accounts of theoretical terms work well with a\ntheory-observation distinction that is relativized to a particular\ntheory. Critics of that distinction, by contrast, have commonly\nattacked a global and static division into theoretical and\nobservational terms (Maxwell 1962; Achinstein 1965). Note finally that\nCarnap assigned no ontological significance to the theory-observation\ndistinction in the sense that entities of the one type would be\nexistent in a more genuine way than ones of the other.\n",
