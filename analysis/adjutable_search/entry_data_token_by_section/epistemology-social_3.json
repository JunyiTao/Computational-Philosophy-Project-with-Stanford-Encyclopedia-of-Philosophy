    "main_text": "Central Topics in Social Epistemology || Testimony\n3.1 Testimony\n\nWhen it comes to the various ways we rely on others as we engage in\nthe pursuit of truth, testimony is paradigmatic. For our purposes\nhere, we can think of testimony as the act in which one agent (the\nspeaker or writer) reports something to an audience. An audience who\naccepts the report on the speaker\u2019s authority acquires a\n\u201ctestimony-based\u201d belief. Social epistemologists have\nraised several questions regarding testimonial transactions.\n\nThe central topic in the \u201cepistemology of testimony\u201d\nconcerns how testimony-based beliefs are to be evaluated. The core\nquestion here is whether testimony is to be regarded as a basic source\nof justification. We can think of a basic source of justification as a\nsource whose reliability can be taken for granted and relied upon,\nexcept in cases in which one has reasons for doubt. As illustration,\nconsider perception. A perceptual belief of yours can be justified\neven without your having reasons to assume that perception is\nreliable. (It suffices that you lack reasons for doubt in the case at\nhand.). The question is whether testimony can be treated\nsimilarly.\n\nThose who deny that testimony is a basic source of justification hold\nthat testimony-based beliefs are justified only if the audience has\nadequate independent reasons to regard the speaker\u2019s testimony\nas trustworthy. Such a view, known as \u201creductionism\u201d since\nit proposes that the justification of these beliefs can be\n\u201creduced to\u201d justifications provided by other sources\n(perception, memory, induction), was defended by David Hume.\nContemporary defenders argue that the denial of reductionism is a\n\u201crecipe for gullibility,\u201d (Fricker 1994), or that it\nsanctions irresponsibility (Faulkner 2000; see also Malmgren 2006 and\nKenyon 2013). By contrast, those who hold that testimony is a\nbasic source of justification hold that testimony-based beliefs are\njustified so long as the audience has no reasons for doubt. Such a\nview, known as \u201canti-reductionism,\u201d was defended by Thomas\nReid (1764/1983), who argued that honesty (in speakers) and credulity\n(in audiences) are as much a part of our natural psychological\nendowment, and so are as worthy of being relied upon in\nbelief-formation, as is the faculty of perception. Contemporary\ntheorists have offered additional arguments for anti-reductionism.\nCoady (1990) argues that audiences typically lack the evidence needed\nto confirm the reliability of the speakers they encounter, so that\ndenying anti-reductionism is a recipe for skepticism; Burge (1993)\nargues that intelligible speech itself is an indication of having been\nproduced by a rational source, one which by nature aims at truth (and\nso is worthy of being believed); and various others have offered\nvariations on Reid\u2019s own argument.\n\nIn addition to the question of whether testimony is a basic source of\njustification, a second question concerns whether we can specify the\nconditions on justified testimony-based belief in individualistic\nterms, that is, terms that are restricted to materials from the\naudience alone (the evidence in her possession, the reliability of her\nfaculties, etc.). While individualism remains the dominant view on\nthis score, a number of social epistemologists have rejected this in\nfavor of one or another version of anti-individualism about\ntestimonial justification. According to these views, the justification\nof an audience\u2019s testimony-based belief can be affected by\nfactors including the speaker\u2019s epistemic condition\n(Welbourne 1981, Hardwig 1991, Schmitt 2006, Lackey 2008, Goldberg\n2010) or the general reliability of testimony in the\naudience\u2019s local environment (Kallestrup and Pritchard\n2012, Gerken 2013, 2022). Still, anti-individualistic views remain\ncontroversial (see Gerken 2012, Leonard 2016, 2018).\n\nA third question social epistemologists have raised regarding\ntestimonial exchanges concerns the interpersonal nature of the act of\ntestifying itself. According to the assurance view of testimony\n(Hinchman 2005, Moran 2006, McMyler 2011), testifying is an act of\nassurance, and beliefs formed on the basis of another\u2019s\nassurance should not be understood in ordinary evidentialist terms.\n(See also Lawlor (2013).) According to trust views (Faulkner 2011,\nKeren 2014), the act of testifying takes place in a context rich with\nnorms of trust whose presence serves to make testimonies more\nreliable, and hence more worthy of trust (see also Graham 2020 for\nrelated discussion). Both views remain controversial (see Lackey\n2008).\n\nA question that has recently begun to attract more attention from\nsocial epistemologists concerns the role of technology in testimony.\nWikipedia entries may be testimony, but they have multiple\nauthors; how does this affect the epistemology of\nWikipedia-based belief? (See Tollefsen 2009, Fallis 2011,\nFricker 2012). ChatGPT and other forms of AI produce reports (or\napparent reports) that incorporate results from fully automated\nsearch; is this testimony? Some, thinking of testimony as a speech act\nfor which a speaker bears responsibility, deny that AI-produced\nsentences constitute testimony (see e.g. Goldberg 2020 for a defense\nof this view regarding instrument-based belief); others embrace the\nidea of AI-testimony and argue that we ought to extend the\nepistemology of testimony accordingly (Freiman and Miller 2020,\nFreiman 2023).\n",
