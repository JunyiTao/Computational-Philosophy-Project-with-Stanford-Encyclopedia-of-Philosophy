    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nHistorically, the use of coercion by powerful actors has been of great\nconcern to philosophers and legal theorists. Detailed attention to\nunderstanding the concept coercion, however, is a relatively\nrecent phenomenon. One effect of this discrepant attention is that it\nis sometimes difficult to determine what precise meaning earlier\nwriters intended in their discussions of \u201ccoercion,\u201d as\nwell as to decide whether \u201ccoercion\u201d captures something\ndifferent from or related to other frequently used terms, such as\nviolence, compulsion, punishment,\nforce, or interference. A brief survey of a few\nnotable thinkers suggests that coercion has commonly been understood\nas a use of a certain kind of power for the purpose of gaining\nadvantages over others (including self-protection), punishing\nnon-compliance with demands, and imposing one\u2019s will on the will\nof other agents. The kind of power needed for these functions is the\nsort that states and other forceful or violent agents possess. One of\nthe clearest, most important uses of coercion has been understood to\nbe the state\u2019s enforcement of law, either through direct uses of\nforce or through punishments meted out to lawbreakers. The\nstate\u2019s use of coercion is thought to be licensed in particular\nfor the sake of preventing private acts of violence or coercion, as\nwell as for punishing the failure to keep agreements. These public\nuses of coercion are thought justified because they make possible\nprivate cooperation and peaceable coexistence among people not linked\nby ties of affection or blood.\n",
