    "main_text": "The Too-Many-Thinkers Objection\n6. The Too-Many-Thinkers Objection\n\nAnother objection to psychological-continuity views is that they rule\nout our being biological organisms (Carter 1989, Ayers 1990:\n278\u2013292, Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997: 80f., 100\u2013109). This is\nbecause no sort of psychological continuity appears to be either\nnecessary or sufficient for a human organism to persist.\n\nWe can see that it\u2019s not necessary by noting that each human\norganism persists as an embryo without psychological continuity. And\nwe can see that it\u2019s not sufficient by imagining that your brain\nis transplanted. In that case the recipient would be uniquely\npsychologically continuous with you, and this continuity would be\ncontinuously physically realized. Any psychological-continuity view\nimplies that she would be you. More generally, any person would go\nwith her transplanted brain. But it does not appear as if any organism\nwould go with its transplanted brain. It looks as if the operation\nwould simply move an organ from one organism to another, like\ntransplanting a liver. It follows that if you were an organism, you\nwould stay behind with an empty head, contrary to\npsychological-continuity views.\n\nPsychological-continuity views do not merely rule out our being\nessentially or \u201cfundamentally\u201d organisms, but our being\norganisms at all. They say that each person has the property of\npersisting by virtue of psychological continuity: of being such that\npsychological continuity (perhaps with a non-branching restriction) is\nboth necessary and sufficient for it to continue existing. But no\norganism has this property. (Or at least no human organism does, and\nwe are clearly not non-human organisms.) Or again: every person would\ngo with her transplanted brain, but no organism would do so. And if\nevery person has a property that no organism has, then no person is an\norganism.\n\nThat is said to be a problem for psychological-continuity views\nbecause healthy, adult human organisms appear to be conscious and\nintelligent. Suppose they are. And suppose, as\npsychological-continuity views appear to imply, that we ourselves are\nnot organisms. Three awkward consequences follow.\n\nFirst, you are one of two intelligent beings sitting there and reading\nthis entry: there is, in addition to you, an organism reading it. More\ngenerally, there are two thinking beings wherever we thought there was\njust one, a person and an organism distinct from it.\n\nSecond, we would expect the organism not just to be intelligent, but\nto be psychologically indistinguishable from you. That would make it a\nperson, if being a person amounts to having mental special properties\n(as on Locke\u2019s definition)\u2014a second person in addition to\nyou. In that case it cannot be true that all people (or even\nall human people) persist by virtue of psychological continuity,\ncontrary to psychological-continuity views. Some\u2014those who are\norganisms\u2014would have brute-physical persistence conditions.\n\nThird, it\u2019s hard to see how you could know whether you yourself\nwere the nonanimal person with psychological persistence conditions or\nthe animal person with brute-physical ones. If you thought you were\nthe nonanimal, the organism would use the same reasoning to conclude\nthat it was too. For all you could ever know, it seems, you\nmight be the one making this mistake.\n\nWe can illustrate the nature of this epistemic problem by imagining a\nthree-dimensional duplicating machine. When you step into the\n\u201cin\u201d box, it reads off your complete physical (and mental)\ncondition and uses this information to assemble a perfect duplicate of\nyou in the \u201cout\u201d box. The process causes momentary\nunconsciousness but is otherwise harmless. Two beings wake up, one in\neach box. The boxes are indistinguishable. Because each being will\nhave the same apparent memories and perceive identical surroundings,\neach will think, for the same reasons, that he or she is you\u2014but\nonly one will be right. If this happened to you, it\u2019s hard to\nsee how you could know, afterwards, whether you were the original or\nthe duplicate. (Suppose the technicians who work the machine are sworn\nto secrecy and immune to bribes.) You would think, \u201cWho am I?\nDid I do the things I seem to remember doing, or did I come into being\nonly a moment ago, complete with false memories of someone\nelse\u2019s life?\u201d And you would have no way of answering these\nquestions. In the same way, psychological-continuity views raise the\nquestions, \u201cWhat am I? Am I a nonanimal that would go with its\nbrain if that organ were transplanted, or an animal that would stay\nbehind with an empty head?\u201d And here too there seem to be no\ngrounds on which to answer them.\n\nThis is the \u201ctoo-many-thinkers\u201d or\n\u201cthinking-animal\u201d objection to psychological-continuity\nviews. The most popular defense against it is to say that, despite\nsharing our brains and showing all the outward signs of consciousness\nand intelligence, human organisms do not think and are not conscious.\nThere simply are no thinking animals to create problems for\npsychological-continuity views (Shoemaker 1984: 92\u201397, Lowe\n1996: 1, Johnston 2007: 55; Baker 2000 offers a more complex\nvariant).\n\nBut although this is easy to say, it\u2019s hard to defend. If human\norganisms cannot be conscious and intelligent, it would seem to follow\nthat no biological organism could have any mental properties at all.\nThis threatens to imply that human organisms are \u201czombies\u201d\nin the philosophical sense: beings physically identical to conscious\nbeings, with the same behavior, but lacking consciousness (Olson\n2018). And it leaves us wondering why organisms cannot be\nconscious. The best proposed answer is given by Shoemaker (1999, 2008,\n2011), who argues that it is because organisms have the wrong\npersistence conditions, but it\u2019s highly controversial.\n\nA second option is to concede that human organisms are psychologically\nindistinguishable from us, but try to explain how we can still know\nthat we are not those organisms. The best-known proposal of this sort\nfocuses on personhood and first-person reference. It says that not\njust any being with mental properties of the sort that you and I\nhave\u2014rationality and self-consciousness, for\ninstance\u2014counts as a person (contrary to anything like\nLocke\u2019s definition). A person must also persist by virtue of\npsychological continuity. It follows that human animals are not people\n(thus avoiding the second awkward consequence, about personhood).\n\nFurther, personal pronouns such as \u2018I\u2019, and the thoughts\nthey express, refer only to people in this sense. So when your animal\nbody says or thinks \u2018I\u2019, it refers not to itself but to\nyou, the person. The organism\u2019s statement \u2018I am a\nperson\u2019 does not express the false belief that it is a\nperson, but the true belief that you are. So the organism is not\nmistaken about which thing it is: it has no first-person beliefs about\nitself at all. And you\u2019re not mistaken either. You can infer\nthat you are a person from the linguistic facts that you are whatever\nyou refer to when you say \u2018I\u2019, and that \u2018I\u2019\nnever refers to anything but a person. You can know that you are not\nthe animal thinking your thoughts because it is not a person and\npersonal pronouns never refer to nonpeople (thus avoiding the third,\nepistemic consequence; see Noonan 1998, 2010, Olson 2002; for a\ndifferent approach see Brueckner and Buford 2009).\n\nThe too-many-thinkers problem arises on the assumption that we are not\norganisms, which appears to follow from psychological-continuity views\nbecause organisms don\u2019t seem to persist by virtue of\npsychological continuity. But some say that human organisms do persist\nby virtue of psychological continuity. Although you are an organism,\nthe transplant operation would not move your brain from one organism\nto another, but would cut an organism down to the size of a brain,\nmove it across the room, and then give it new parts to replace the\nones it lost. The view is sometimes called \u201cnew animalism\u201d\n(Madden 2016, Noonan 2021; see also Langford 2014, Olson 2015:\n102\u2013106).\n",
