    "main_text": "Interventions That Do Not Involve Human Action\n8. Interventions That Do Not Involve Human Action\n\nWe noted above that a free action need not meet the conditions for an\nintervention, on any of the conceptions of intervention described in\n \u00a75.\n It is also true that a process or event can qualify as an\nintervention even if it does not involve human action or intention at\nany point. This should be apparent from the way in which the notion of\nan intervention has been characterized, for this is entirely in terms\nof causal and correlational concepts and makes no reference to human\nbeings or their activities. In other words, a purely\n\u201cnatural\u201d process involving no animate beings at all can\nqualify as an intervention as long as it has the right sort of causal\nhistory\u2014indeed, this sort of possibility is often described by\nscientists as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d. Moreover, even when\nmanipulations are carried out by human beings, it is the causal\nfeatures of those manipulations and not the fact that they are carried\nout by human beings or are free or are attended by a special\nexperience of agency that matters for recognizing and characterizing\ncausal relationships. Thus, by giving up any attempt at reduction and\ncharacterizing the notion of an intervention in causal terms, an\n\u201cinterventionist\u201d approach of the sort described under\n \u00a7\u00a74\u20135\n and\n 7\n avoids the second classical problem besetting manipulability\ntheories\u2014that of anthropocentrism and commitment to a privileged\nstatus for human action. For example, under this approach \\(X\\) will\nqualify as a (total) cause of \\(Y\\) as long as it is true that for\nsome value of \\(X\\) that if \\(X\\) were to be changed to that value by\na process having the right sort of causal characteristics, the value\nof \\(Y\\) would change. Obviously, this claim can be true even if human\nbeings lack the power to manipulate \\(X\\) or even in a world in which\nhuman beings do not or could not exist. There is nothing in the\ninterventionist version of a manipulability theory that commits us to\nthe view that all causal claims are in some way dependent for their\ntruth on the existence of human beings or involve a\n\u201cprojection\u201d on to the world of our experience of\nagency.\n",
