    "main_text": "Possibilism || Possibilism (and Actualism) Defined\n2.3 Possibilism (and Actualism) Defined\n\n\nIn its simplest form, possibilism is the view that an agent is\nobligated to perform an act just in case it is part of the best series\nof acts she can perform over the course of her life. It may be defined\nmore formally as follows.\n\n Possibilism: At t an agent S is\nobligated to \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\) iff S can \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\)\nand \\(\\phi\\)-ing at \\(t'\\) is part of the best act-set that S\ncan perform from \\(t'\\) until the last time she can perform an act.\n\n\n\nAccording to possibilism, the act-sets that have their deontic status\ndirectly (i.e., they do not have their deontic status in virtue of the\ndeontic status of any other act-set) are the act-sets that agents can\nperform over the course of their entire lives, which we will refer to\nas maximal act-sets (\u00c5qvist 1969). Moreover, any non-maximal\nact-set has its deontic status indirectly (i.e., its deontic status is\ndetermined by the deontic status of a maximal act-set of which it is a\npart). In Professor Procrastinate, assuming that\nProcrastinate cannot perform any acts after doing either \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle Z\\rangle\\),\npossibilists hold that Procrastinate is obligated to \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\) because the best maximal act-set she can perform over the\ncourse of her life includes \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), and \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle \\)-ing requires \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)-ing.\n\n\nPossibilism has been given slightly different definitions in the\nliterature. However, unlike the different definitions of actualism\ndiscussed in the next section, typical definitions of possibilism are\nessentially synonymous. Patricia Greenspan (1978) does not offer a\nformal definition of possibilism, but defends the view by way of\nrejecting Holly Goldman\u2019s actualist principle, referred to as\n(G*1). Greenspan does so in the process of defending her (1975) view\nin a related debate concerning whether ought-statements should be\ndated differently from their objects and about whether they hold from\ndifferent temporal standpoints. Fred Feldman defines possibilism in\nterms of possible worlds. Feldman refers to his theory as (MO). As he\ncharacterizes (MO), what S is morally obligated to do,\n\u201cas of a time, t\u201d, is \n\n\nto see to the occurrence of a state of affairs, p, iff p\noccurs in some world accessible to S at t, and it is not\nthe case that \\({\\sim}p\\) occurs in any accessible world as good as\n(or better than) that one. (Feldman 1986: 38)\n\n\n\nMichael Zimmerman defines possibilism in the simpler, standard sense\ngiven above (2006: 153; 2017: 119). However, he also develops and\ndefends (MO)-inspired formulations of possibilism. In his (1996) book,\nhe provides a formulation of what he refers to as \u201cworld\npossibilism\u201d (WP) that invokes the notion of \u201cdeontic\nvalue\u201d instead of \u201cintrinsic value\u201d, so as to\nprevent the formulation of possibilism from assuming impartial\nconsequentialism. In his (2006: 166) essay, he defends a prospective\nversion of (WP), where the value in question is the expected value of\nall the acts an agent can intentionally perform, which he refers to as\n\u201cadjusted core prospective value\u201d.\n\n\nThere are other views that deviate from the above standard definitions\nof possibilism. Carlson (1995: 99\u2013109; 1999) defends a view that\nbears resemblance to possibilism in which the sole obligatory act-set\nis a unique minimally specific invariably optimal act-set. At t\nan act-set is optimal for an agent S just in case its outcome\nis at least as good as any other act-set that is performable for\nS at t. An invariably optimal act-set is one which is\noptimal no matter what S does at t. An invariably\noptimal act-set is minimally specific just in case it is not a proper\npart of some other invariably optimal act-set available to S. A\nminimally specific invariably optimal act-set is unique just in case\nthere is no other minimally specific invariably optimal act-set\navailable to S. Thus, in contrast to standard formulations of\npossibilism, no act-set that is a proper part of a unique minimally\nspecific invariably optimal act-set has a deontic status. Vorobej\n(2000) defends a view he refers to as \u201cprosaic\npossibilism\u201d, which may be considered an intermediary between\npossibilism and actualism. In his (2009) article, which contains an\nargument against possibilism, Woodard defines the view in terms of\nnormative reasons for action rather than moral obligations. As a final\nexample, in his (2016) article, Vessel proposes what he takes to be a\n\u201cpossibilist variant\u201d of a view known as moral securitism,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 4.\n The first possibilist definition given in this section, however,\ncaptures the standard understanding of possibilism and the commitments\nof its proponents, including Greenspan (1978), Thomason (1981),\nHumberstone (1983), Feldman (1986: 38), and Zimmerman (1990; 1996:\n190; 2006; 2008: ch. 3; 2017). On this definition, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper since it is part of the best\nseries of acts that she can perform over the course of her life.\n\n\nIn contrast to possibilism, standard forms of actualism hold that\nProcrastinate is obligated to decline to review the paper because what\nwould actually happen if Procrastinate were to do this is better than\nwhat would actually happen if she were to agree to review the paper.\nFor, what would happen if Procrastinate were to decline the invitation\nis that the student would receive a second-rate job offer. However, if\nshe were to agree to review the paper then she would not review it and\nthe student would receive no job offer. A simple, but not\nunproblematic, version of actualism holds the following:\n\n Actualism: At t an agent S is\nobligated to \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\) iff S can \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\)\nand what would happen if S were to \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t'\\) is better\nthan what would happen if S were to perform any alternative act\nat \\(t'\\).\n\n\nOne problem with this definition is that it blurs together the\nintrinsic value of the consequences of an act and the deontic value of\nthat act. An actualist\u2019s stance with respect to the relationship\nbetween these different types of value depends upon her preferred\nnormative ethical theory. We will discuss more precise and informative\ndefinitions of actualism in\n section 3.\n However, the above definition suffices to illustrate the primary\ndifference between actualism and possibilism.\n",
