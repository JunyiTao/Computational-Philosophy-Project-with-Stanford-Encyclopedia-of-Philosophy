    "main_text": "\n\nSuppose that you have been invited to attend an ex-partner\u2019s\nwedding and that the best thing you can do is accept the invitation\nand be pleasant at the wedding. But, suppose furthermore that if you\ndo accept the invitation, you\u2019ll freely decide to get inebriated\nat the wedding and ruin it for everyone, which would be the worst\noutcome. The second best thing to do would be to simply decline the\ninvitation. In light of these facts, should you accept or decline the\ninvitation? (Zimmerman 2006: 153). The answer to this question hinges\non the actualism/possibilism debate in ethics, which concerns the\nrelationship between an agent\u2019s free actions and her moral\nobligations. In particular, it focuses on whether facts about how an\nagent would freely act in certain contexts play any role in\ndetermining the agent\u2019s moral obligations. Historically, the\ndebate has primarily arisen in the work of impartial consequentialists\nwith an interest in deontic logic. However, its relevance is not\nlimited to such versions of consequentialism. The debate concerns the\nscope of acts that are relevant options for the agent, which is an\nissue that cuts across, and has substantive implications for, a wide\nrange of normative ethical views. As such, the debate brings into\nfocus issues of central importance for any normative ethical\ntheory.\n",
