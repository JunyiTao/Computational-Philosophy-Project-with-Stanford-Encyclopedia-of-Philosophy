Unwaivable obligations to oneself\n\nThe most popular response to the paradox is to insist that duties to\noneself exist while denying that they imply waivable rights against\noneself. This means rejecting either the first or second premise of\nSinger\u2019s argument:\n\nIf A has a duty to B, then B has a\nright against A.\nIf B has a right against A, he [or she] can give\nit up and release A from the obligation.\nNo one can release himself [or herself] from an obligation.\n\n\nEither duties don\u2019t entail rights, or rights don\u2019t always\ngrant the power of release.\n\nOne of Singer\u2019s first critics, Daniel Kading (1959), defends\nrights without release. Kading says we only have rights against people\nwith whom we have struck some kind of agreement \u2013 like a promise\nor contract \u2013 and sometimes, these people aren\u2019t around to\nrelease us. They might, for example, be dead. There is no hope of\nrelease in such a scenario, and yet the right remains. But even if\nthis correct, it won\u2019t do anything to establish duties to\noneself (as Kading seems to admit). There is something fishy about the\nidea of \u201cagreements\u201d with oneself, and, as Mu\u00f1oz\n(2020, 694) points out, the deathbed promise has no one-person\nanalogue. (See Singer 1963, 133\u201335, for further objections.)\n\nKading next tries a different maneuver, which has become a classic. He\ndistinguishes two kinds of \u201cobligations-to.\u201d One typically\nsprings from promises and contracts (the\n\u201cagreement-sense\u201d), and the other has to do with affecting\npeople\u2019s interests (the \u201cbenefits-sense\u201d). Kading\nagrees with Singer that we can\u2019t have obligations to ourselves\nin the first way, but insists that we can in the second. We are\n\u201cmorally obligated\u201d to \u201cmaximize goodness\u201d\neven when that just means making ourselves happy (Kading 1959,\n156).\n\nThis same move shows up all over, particularly in the work of Kantian\nethicists, who draw not on Kading but on Kant\u2019s distinction\nbetween \u201cjuridical\u201d and \u201cnon-juridical\u201d duties\n(see MM 6:383, LE 29:117, 632). Juridical duties are\nexternal, concerning acts rather than motives, and\nenforceable by coercion and demands. For example, if you\nthreaten not to pay me the money you contractually owe me, I can\ndemand that you fork over the cash, and I can sue you if you\ndon\u2019t. But I can\u2019t demand that you pay me out of the love\nof your heart. I can demand only the external act \u2013 the\nforking-over. A non-juridical duty, by contrast, requires the right\nmindset as well as the right action. Non-juridical duty is, basically,\na matter of caring about important things for the right reasons\n\u2013 for example, loving and respecting your neighbors because they\nmatter. Now the key point. For Kant, only juridical duties\ninvolve powers of release. If I offer to void the contract, you can\nget out of your duty to pay me. But there is no way to get release\nfrom your duty to love your neighbors because they matter \u2013 it\nis not as if your neighbors can stop mattering at will! (See\nMM 6:219.)\n\nSo here is the Kantian move. We say Singer is right about\njuridical duties, which really do come with rights and powers\nof release. There is no such thing as a juridical duty to oneself. But\nwe insist there can still be non-juridical duties to oneself,\nsince these do not imply rights and powers of release.\n\nThis move is extremely popular, though not everyone uses the term\n\u201cjuridical.\u201d Wick (1960, 1961) and Knight (1961)\ndistinguish legal from non-legal duties (see also Mothersill\u2019s\n1960 reply to Wick, which emphasizes that Wick doesn\u2019t defend\n\u201cduties\u201d to self in the ordinary sense). Eisenberg (1968)\ndiscusses \u201csocial contractual\u201d duties. Paton (1990,\n225\u201326) defends \u201cnon-contractual\u201d duties to oneself.\nHills (2005) rejects the \u201c\u2018juridical\u2019 model\u201d\nof duties and defends an unwaivable, non-juridical duty to promote\none\u2019s own well-being. Kahn, in 2018, argues that Kant himself\nshould have endorsed a duty to promote one\u2019s own\nhappiness, despite his arguments to the contrary. For a bit more\ndiscussion on what Kant thinks we owe to ourselves, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nKant on What We Owe to Ourselves\n\n\nThe result is a certain humanistic, rather than legalistic, picture of\nduties to oneself: they do not have to do with rights and agreements,\nbut instead with caring and valuing; they are not under voluntary\ncontrol, but instead spring from unchangeable features of our\npersonality, like our capacity to make free choices (in Kant\u2019s\ncase) or our susceptibility to pain (in Hills\u2019 and Kahn\u2019s)\n\u2013 basic things about our psychology that make us human. We can\nwaive our rights at will and go on with our day; we cannot so easily\ntake a break from our humanity.\n\nOn this view, there is something called a \u201cduty to\noneself\u201d that slips through the jaws of Paradox \u2013\ndefinitely a victory. But some object that the victory is hollow: the\nKantians have carved out a space for \u201cnon-juridical\u201d\nduties to oneself while totally surrendering to Singer when it comes\nto the juridical. This objection may have bite if\n\u201cduties,\u201d as ordinarily conceived, are juridical at heart.\nIt is worth asking: what kind of \u201cduty\u201d doesn\u2019t come\nwith any rights, waivers, or enforcement? Aren\u2019t these the very\nthings that make a duty distinct from a mere value or virtue? Many\nwriters \u2013 following the legal theorist Wesley Hohfeld (1913,\n1917) \u2013 would even say that A\u2019s duty to B just is\nthe flipside of B\u2019s right against A (this sort of right is also\ncalled a claim; see e.g., Gilbert 2018; Johnson 2010; Mu\u00f1oz\n2021; Thomson 1990, chap. 1). We might hesitate to go as far as\nHohfeld in equating duties with rights. Still, some might wonder what\nis left after we subtract from a duty its rights-related upshots\n(Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 693). Are non-juridical duties really duties at\nall?\n\nPaul Schofield (2015) defends something closer to an unwaivable\njuridical duty to oneself. Schofield argues that you owe it to\nyourself not to cause yourself harm in the future \u2013 as you might\nby smoking heavily in your youth and giving yourself lung cancer. You\nalso owe it to yourself not to hamstring your future choices, as in\nDerek Parfit\u2019s (1984, 327\u201328) example of the Russian\nnobleman, who arranges as a young socialist to prevent his future self\nfrom funding conservative causes. Schofield\u2019s picture is this.\nYou owe a certain action to someone when they can legitimately demand\nthat you do it. But you can also imagine demands made by yourself of\nyourself, from different perspectives within your life. When you\nsmoke, causing yourself to suffer in the future, you can look upon\nthis either from the perspective of the future sufferer or the present\nsmoker. The future smoker \u2013 that is, you from your future\nperspective \u2013 could justifiably demand less smoking from you in\nthe present, generating a duty not to smoke. Moreover, you cannot\npresently waive this duty, since you do not now occupy the right\nperspective (Schofield 2015, 17; see also Schofield 2019).\n\nThis proposal is enormously creative \u2013 a leap forward in\nphilosophical thinking about obligations to oneself. No doubt the link\nbetween duties, demands, and perspectives will play an important role\nin future work on the subject. That said, there have been some\nobjections to this form of Schofield\u2019s view. In particular, some\nworry that it makes our relation to our future selves too chilly and\nantagonistic, like our relation to a non-consenting other (Kanygina\nforthcoming; Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 694\u201395). If we cannot\nnow waive our duties not to harm ourselves in the future, it\nseems to follow that we may not impose costs on our future selves,\neven for our own greater good. This seems too stringent; there is\nnothing wrong with taking a medication that cures a severe ailment\ntoday while causing moderately bad side-effects in the future. Harming\noneself can be justified when it makes one\u2019s life better on the\nwhole. In this respect, self-harm is much like doing harm to a\nconsenting\n other.[4]\n",
