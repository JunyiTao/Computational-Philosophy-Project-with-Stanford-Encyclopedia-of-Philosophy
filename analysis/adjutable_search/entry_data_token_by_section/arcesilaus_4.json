    "main_text": "Inapprehensibility and universal suspension of assent || The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n4.2 The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe RNB view of Arcesilaus denies that his acceptance of\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension is\nexplained in terms of belief in the premises and hence in the\nconclusions of his arguments. Rather, on this account Arcesilaus\nguides his rational activity by something like a supposition or\nhypothesis\u2014a set of notions deployed variously in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, Theophrastus\u2019 dialectic, and geometrical theory (see\nSchofield 1999 and Thorsrud 2018; cf. B\u00e9natou\u00efl & El\nMurr 2010). Even the Stoics distinguished hypotheticals from\nassertions and arguments, such that one can accept hypotheses and what\nfollows from them without asserting them (see Barnes 1997). Arcesilaus\ncould have adapted this kind of theory to account for the rational\nactivities of the skeptic. Accounts of impression and assent also\nafford a distinction between beliefs and belief-like imaginings such\nas suppositions, which may then take the place of beliefs in chains of\ninference. This distinction allows for a reasoned commitment\nthat falls short of assent (see Striker 1980, Bett 1990, and\nReinhardt 2018). Arcesilaus, on this view, supposes that we ought to\nlive without realist commitments that fix our view of the world. His supposition may have been based on\npremises\u2014some of which he shared with Zeno\u2014as well as on a\ngeneralization from his philosophical experience, after repeatedly\nfinding that rational inquiry does not justify assent.\n\n\nHowever, this proposal must address several problems. For instance,\nit seems doubtful that a rational life can be based on hypotheticals\nwithout a large web of background beliefs (see Frede 1979 and Bett\n1989). Without them, the skeptic seems unable to decide which\nhypotheses to suppose and when to suppose them. And even if such a life\nis possible, it is not clear how it would be practically\ndistinguishable from, and so preferable to, a life based wholly on\nbelief. If the skeptic regards as hypothetical the very same things we\nordinarily believe, then skepticism seems unmotivated. (See Thorsrud\n2010 and Perin 2013 for other objections.) Perhaps one could defend\nthe possibility of a radically skeptical life of this kind by saying\nthat, while its development requires starting with beliefs, over time\nan increasing number of background beliefs may be substituted with\nhypotheses, and that the benefits of the skeptical life are of a\nsecond-order, affecting the ease with which the skeptic can change the\nguiding assumptions of her life.\n",
