    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism? || The philosophical significance of mathematical platonism\n1.2 The philosophical significance of mathematical platonism\n\nMathematical platonism has considerable philosophical significance. If\nthe view is true, it will put great pressure on the physicalist idea\nthat reality is exhausted by the physical. For platonism entails that\nreality extends far beyond the physical world and includes objects\nthat aren\u2019t part of the causal and spatiotemporal order studied\nby the physical\n sciences.[1]\n Mathematical platonism, if true, will also put great pressure on many\nnaturalistic theories of knowledge. For there is little doubt that we\npossess mathematical knowledge. The truth of mathematical platonism\nwould therefore establish that we have knowledge of abstract (and thus\ncausally inefficacious) objects. This would be an important discovery,\nwhich many naturalistic theories of knowledge would struggle to\naccommodate.\n\nAlthough these philosophical consequences are not unique to\nmathematical platonism, this particular form of platonism is\nunusually well suited to support such consequences. For mathematics is\na remarkably successful discipline, both in its own right and as a\ntool for other\n sciences.[2]\n Few contemporary analytic philosophers are willing to contradict any\nof the core claims of a discipline whose scientific credentials are as\nstrong as those of mathematics (Lewis 1991, pp. 57\u20139). So if\nphilosophical analysis revealed mathematics to have some strange and\nsurprising consequences, it would be unattractive simply to reject\n mathematics.[3]\n A form of platonism based on a discipline whose scientific\ncredentials are less impressive than those of mathematics would not be\nin this fortunate situation. For instance, when theology turns out to\nhave some strange and surprising philosophical consequences, many\nphilosophers do not hesitate to reject the relevant parts of\ntheology.\n",
