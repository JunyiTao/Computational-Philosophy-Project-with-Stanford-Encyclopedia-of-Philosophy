    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || The Consent Theory: The Options Argument\n4.3 The Consent Theory: The Options Argument\n\n\nSome have proposed what this entry will call the options\nargument against the kind of considerations the instrumentalist\nadduces. The instrumentalist argues that I have natural duties of\njustice to promote just institutions and that these duties are best\nsatisfied by complying with the authority of a reasonably just\nstate. But the philosophical anarchist could argue that though I may\nhave a duty of justice, it does not entail that I must obey any\nparticular institution for promoting justice. The idea here is that\njust as Amnesty International may not require me to pay dues to it\nregardless of my membership even though these dues would clearly\nadvance the protection of human rights throughout the world, so the\nstate may not require me to comply with its commands even though such\ncompliance would advance the purposes of justice in the world. Let us\nsuppose that the reasons clearly favor my support of Amnesty\nInternational. Intuitively, it still may not require me to lend it\nsupport. Only if I have voluntarily joined and voluntarily remain in\nAmnesty do I have a duty to do what the conditions of membership\nrequire. And I am under no obligation to join Amnesty; I may join\nother organizations to fulfill whatever duties of aid that I have. So\nwhether I ought to join Amnesty and be subject to membership dues is\nup to me. The consent theorist seems to think that, in the same way,\nonly if I voluntarily transact to obligate myself to comply with the\nstate's commands can I be said to have a duty to comply with the\nstate. I must somehow enlist myself in the project of promoting the\ngood causes that the state promotes (Simmons 2001).\n",
