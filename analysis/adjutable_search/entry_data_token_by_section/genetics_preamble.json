    "main_text": "\n\nEvelyn Fox Keller dubbed the 1900s the \u201ccentury of the\ngene\u201d, and for good reason (Fox Keller 2002). During a 100-year\nspan that opened with excitement about the research Mendel conducted\ndecades earlier and closed with the Human Genome Project, disciplines\nranging from comparative anatomy to oncology were infused with genetic\nconcepts, genetic principles, and genetic methodologies. The first two\ndecades of the twenty-first century have seen this trend only\nexpand.\n\nSo it should not be surprising that philosophers have gravitated to\ngenetics in an attempt to understand how that science works, what it\nsays about the world, and what impact it has on people living in a\nsociety where there is so much focus on genes. This encyclopedia\nrepresents well this significant philosophical interest. Over 100\nentries discuss some aspect of genetics, and those entries engage a\nwide range of philosophical questions\u2014questions about scientific\nexplanation, questions about the process of evolution, questions about\ndisability, questions about race. With such diverse philosophical\ninterest in genetics, no single encyclopedia entry could do justice to\nthe full scope of that science and the rich philosophical attention it\nhas received. Instead, this entry serves as a door into that\nphilosophical world. After a historically-guided introduction to the\nscience of genetics and its transformative impact, the piece reviews a\nsample of the philosophical questions that genetics has generated,\nwith direction to entries where those topics are discussed in greater\ndetail. The hope is that the entry will serve as an orientation to the\ndiversity of philosophical thought concerning genetics that is\ndistributed throughout the encyclopedia. (The entry on\n evolution\n provides a similar guide to the trove of entries that review\nphilosophical discussions around that topic.)\n",
