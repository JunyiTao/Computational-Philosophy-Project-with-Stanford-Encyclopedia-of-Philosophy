    "main_text": "The Calm Between the Storms || Milne\u2019s Ultimate Success\n7.3 Milne\u2019s Ultimate Success\n\nThree years later, Milne was awarded the James Scott prize, the most\nprestigious award for \u2018natural philosophy\u2019 in the\nAnglophone world. Milne\u2019s lecture title is telling:\n\u201cFundamental Concepts of Natural Philosophy\u201d (Milne 1943).\nAlthough Milne does concede to Dingle that he no longer believes that\nit is possible to deduce physics completely in the absence of\nreference to phenomena, for the most part his award lecture is a long\nreiteration of his previous twelve years\u2019 work in cosmology.\n\nOne year later, Milne received his ultimate accolade, election as\npresident of the Royal Astronomical Society. In his inaugural lecture,\nMilne again reviews his work, but adds two remarks of interest. First,\nhe modifies his earlier view that theories are acceptable solely on\nthe basis of their successful predictive power; to this, he now adds\nthat a theory cannot be accepted as satisfactory unless it is\nphilosophically satisfying (Milne 1943, p. 120). Secondly, on a\npersonal note, he admits that he is still amazed at the outcry that\nhis theory and its philosophy caused. Milne here is being a bit\ndisingenuous. In many places in his letters he not only recognizes the\noutcry, he delights in it, and seeks to provoke it even more (Milne\n1932\u201337, 12 May 35; 28 Jul 36).\n\nFrom this point onward, cosmology\u2019s philosophy is no longer\ndirectly influenced by Milne himself. Moreover, kinematic relativity\nbegan to stagnate as a research programme; except for Whitrow, Milne\nhad no new students, and failed to attract any new converts to the\ntheory (Whitrow, 1996). His personal philosophical work was done.\n\nBut although his personal philosophical work was done, and kinematic\nrelativity seemed moribund as a research program, in the late 1990s it\nwas rediscovered, and Milne\u2019s model, as it was\nchristened, came into renewed interest as a source of predictions for\ncosmological behaviour such as rates of cosmic expansion, and\nproduction of cosmological strings. (Moncy, 2016; Russo, 2003).\n\nBut even though Milne himself retreated into the background, his\nphilosophical influence didn\u2019t end, in fact it wasn\u2019t to\ncrest until the end of the 40s in the work of another man, Hermann\nBondi. Again, however, a storm was generated by Milne\u2019s methods,\neven though they were now in the hands of another.\n",
