    "main_text": "Republican Liberty and The History of England || Macaulay\u2019s History as a response to Hume\n2.3 Macaulay\u2019s History as a response to Hume\n\nIt has often been noticed that Macaulay\u2019s history was read as a\nresponse to the popular history of the period published by David Hume,\nand certainly, Macaulay\u2019s understanding of the significance of the\nEnglish Civil War, the virtues of the republicans, and the grounds of\nmorality, challenge Hume. Their ideas belong to two diametrically\nopposed strands of Enlightenment thought. Her religious and ethical\nviews belong to the \u201cmoderate enlightenment\u201d, as\ncharacterised by Jonathan Israel, while her politics are radical. By\ncontrast, Hume is a naturalist and sceptic whose religious views are\nin line with those that Israel associates with the \u201cradical\nenlightenment\u201d, yet he is a political conservative (Israel 2010,\n2011; Green 2011; Green 2020). As mentioned above, a tension exists in Locke\u2019s\nphilosophy between his political ideals, which propose the existence\nof a natural law, which can be known by reason, and his general\ncommitment to an empiricist epistemology. Hume develops Locke\u2019s\nempiricism in the direction of its sceptical implications, resulting\nin rejection of the existence of God, immutable moral truth and causal\nnecessity. By contrast, Macaulay follows Locke the political\nphilosopher, and accepts the existence of God, and immutable moral\ntruth, without concerning herself too deeply with regard to the\nquestion of how it is that an \u201cabstract fitness of things\u201d\ncan \u201cenable us to compare and perceive the agreement and\ndisagreement of our sensitive and reflex ideas\u201d.\n\nFamously, Hume had criticised those moral theorists whose doctrines\nMacaulay continued to assert,\n\n\n\u2026 who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to reason;\nthat there are eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, which are\nthe same to every rational being that considers them; that the\nimmutable measure of right and wrong impose an obligation, not only on\nhuman creatures, but also on the Deity himself: (Hume 1964,\n2.234\u20135)\n\n\nHe goes on to argue that moral injunctions motivate, and that since\nonly the passions can motivate, moral injunctions must be grounded in\nthe passions. Ultimately, for Hume, what is good is what is useful, a\nmodern version of the Epicureanism, which Burnet had argued, follows\nfrom empiricism. For Hume, political constitutions are not grounded in\nimmutable truths, but are based in convention. Since the functioning\nof a set of conventions depends on people agreeing to abide by certain\nrules, which are in themselves arbitrary, it is important that people\nrevere authority. For him, the execution of Charles I was a tragedy,\nbrought about by deluded enthusiasts. And he comments in relation to\nthis act:\n\n\nGovernment is instituted, in order to restrain the fury and injustice\nof the people; and being always founded on opinion, not on force, it\nis dangerous, by these speculations, to weaken the reverence, which\nthe multitude owe to authority, and to instruct them before-hand, that\nthe case can ever happen, when they may be free\u2019d from their duty of\nallegiance. (Hume 1754, 1.470)\n\n\nMacaulay\u2019s fundamental attitude to Hume\u2019s history is evident in a\nshort correspondence, which took place in 1764, after a copy of the\nfirst volume of her history had been sent to him. Here Macaulay\nsuccinctly argues that Hume\u2019s conventionalism implies an obligation to\nconservatism. Hume suggests that he and Macaulay do not differ as to\nthe facts, but rather on the interpretation that they place on them\nand he continues: \n\n\nI look upon all kinds of subdivision of power, from the monarchy of\nFrance to the freest democracy of some Swiss cantons, to be equally\nlegal, if established by custom and authority. (\u201cAccount of the\nLife\u201d 1783, 331; Macaulay 2019, 38)\n\n\nMacaulay\u2019s response is: \n\n\nYour position, that all governments established by custom and\nauthority carry with them obligations to submission and allegiance,\ndoes, I am afraid, involve all reformers in unavoidable guilt, since\nopposition to established error must needs be opposition to authority.\n\n\n\nAs a serious reformer, she believed in objective universal standards\nof justice, which were not being upheld in the Great Britain of her\nday, just as they had not been during the period that led up to the\nCivil War.\n",
