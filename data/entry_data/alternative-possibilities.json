    "preamble": "\n\nSuppose you harm, offend, or otherwise wrong another person.\nConfronted with the possibility of sanction, you might say any of the\nfollowing in an attempt avoid blame: \u201cI couldn\u2019t help\nit.\u201d \u201cSomeone made me do it.\u201d \u201cI had no\nchoice.\u201d \u201cIt was unavoidable.\u201d \u201cThere was no\nother option.\u201d There\u2019s a natural reading of such defenses\non which they appeal to the principle at the center of this entry, the\n\u201cPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities\u201d (cp. Frankfurt\n1969):\n\n\nPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): a\nperson is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could\nhave done otherwise.\n\n\nAlthough its precise form and interpretation have varied, this\nprinciple has enjoyed broad support in the history of philosophy. PAP\nwas a standard\u2014even if not universal\u2014presupposition of\nGreek, medieval, and early modern thought (Irwin 1999: 225; Pasnau\n2003: 226; Rowe 1987: 43). And until about fifty years ago, it was\nusually taken for granted by both sides in debates on whether moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism.\n\nNo doubt the principle\u2019s appeal can in part be traced to\nordinary moral practice. One day at the cafeteria, Kurt steals\nJohn\u2019s lunch. Under normal circumstances, we hold Kurt\nresponsible for his act. But now add that he had to act as he did.\nSuppose, for example, that Kurt was coerced by a bully to steal\nJohn\u2019s lunch; or he is suffering from a neurological disorder\ncompelling him to act; or he was brainwashed. These are some of the\nmany ways in which his alternatives can be closed off. But however\nthis happens, once the alternatives are gone\u2014once Kurt must act\nas he does\u2014blaming him no longer seems appropriate.\n\nPAP presents one requirement for moral responsibility. There are\nothers. For example, we often excuse those who act out of ignorance.\nSuppose it turns out that, contrary to initial reports, Kurt\nreasonably mistook John\u2019s lunch for his own; it was this\ninnocent mistake that resulted in the \u201ctheft\u201d. Here too we\nshould be much less inclined to blame Kurt, for in the relevant sense,\nhe didn\u2019t know what he was doing. Such examples suggest that in\naddition to PAP, there is an epistemic condition for responsibility.\nAnd there are still other candidate requirements. But while some of\nthem are closely related to the ability to do otherwise, for the most\npart they will, like the epistemic condition, be set to one side in\nthis entry: the focus will be on PAP.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Background\n\nLike most important philosophical claims, PAP is more complex than it\nfirst appears. It\u2019s useful for now to suppress many of these\ncomplexities. But a few of them should be mentioned at the outset, if\nonly to make some simplifying assumptions and bracket certain\ncontroversies. We begin, however, with some reasons to think this\ntopic is worth the effort.\n1.1 The Importance of PAP\n\nWe are both moral and embodied agents, persons and organisms. We move\nin the space of reasons, answerable to rules of morality and\nrationality, as well as a space of causes, governed by the laws of\nnature. How are these two aspects of our lives linked? This question\nis too big to answer here. But PAP, if true, is one piece of the\npuzzle. Our status as persons is enabled by a kind of power we\nexercise in the world of causes, namely, the power to choose among\nalternative courses of action. In this way, our principle links a\nnormative feature of our lives to a causal feature.\n\nBut with this abstract promise comes a concrete threat. The principle\ntells us that when alternatives are blocked, when only one course of\naction is available, you are not responsible for what you do. As noted\nearlier, there are some extreme conditions, such as coercion, that can\npreclude responsibility by blocking alternatives. But suppose it turns\nout that even under standard conditions, no one has alternatives.\nGiven PAP, no one is morally responsible for anything. Universal\nalternative-blockers have frequently appeared in the philosophical\nliterature. They include bivalence, divine foreknowledge, divine\nsovereignty, mechanism, psychological determinism, and causal\ndeterminism. If, due to any of these, none of us can act otherwise\nthan we actually act, then PAP will join in to produce a disturbing\nconclusion: we are never responsible for what we do. A less global but\nequally worrisome threat is that our principle will combine with some\nthesis entailing the widespread reduction of abilities, even if not\ntheir elimination. For example, situational, genetic, or\nsocio-economic influences, while not universally blocking\nalternatives, could so severely limit them in particular cases that,\nwith PAP in the background, moral praise and blame are no longer\nappropriate. (On the threat of \u201csituationism\u201d, see Nelkin\n2005; McKenna & Warmke 2017.)\n\nAnother reason PAP is important is that it intersects with the\nphilosophy and practice of law. Even if moral and legal responsibility\ndo not coincide, there is a region of overlap (Duff 2009; Brink &\nNelkin 2013) where PAP and its attendant literature can inform legal\nreasoning, especially when it aims at the just punishment of\nwrongdoers. A necessary condition of criminal responsibility is that\nthe conduct included a voluntary act (Sinnott-Armstrong 2012), one\nthat the accused had a \u201creasonable opportunity to avoid\u201d\n(Kelly 2017). If Mark was sleepwalking or hypnotized when he broke\ninto Ken\u2019s house, this could be excused, both morally and\nlegally, on the grounds that in his condition, Mark could not have\ndone otherwise. If, due to delusion, an accused murderer could not\navoid forming the intention to kill his victim\u2014and acting\naccordingly\u2014this also could be exculpating.\n\nThat said, standards applied by the law may not match what in moral\ncontexts we think of as avoidable action. Imagine that a mild\nprovocation, one that a reasonable person could ignore, compels an\nemotionally disturbed man to murder. Criminal law evaluates his\nabilities according to the reasonable person standard\u2014thereby\nconvicting him of murder rather than manslaughter\u2014even if moral\nreasoning would take into account the emotional state severely\nrestricting his alternatives (Kelly 2017). The relation between PAP\nand the law is further complicated by the fact that criminal law does\nnot seem especially concerned with causal determinism (Morse 2013), a\nthesis widely thought to limit us to exactly one future. That said, if\nthe irrelevance of determinism in the law reflects some degree of\nindifference toward alternatives in assigning responsibility, this\ncould be part of a case against PAP in moral matters as well (see also\n \u00a73.1).\n1.2 What is Moral Responsibility?\n\nStart with what a person is morally responsible for. As\nformulated above, PAP is about responsibility for what a person\n\u201chas done\u201d. For most of this entry this will be\ninterpreted to mean her actions (see entry on\n action),\n here construed broadly to include both overt actions, such as walking\nto the store or shooting a gun, and mental actions, such as choosing\nto go to law school or calculating a move in chess. In addition to\nbeing responsible for actions, a person can be responsible for the\nconsequences of her actions. By putting salt in Sean\u2019s tea,\nMeghan is responsible, not just for ruining Sean\u2019s tea (what she\ndid), but for his tea\u2019s being ruined (the consequence of what\nshe did). A politician\u2019s opponents may claim she is responsible\nfor an economic downturn, a result of her decisions and policies.\nFinally, a person can be responsible for failures to act, sometimes\nknown as refrainings or omissions, and the consequences of such. Luke\nthe indifferent lifeguard is accountable for not saving the drowning\nswimmer, and thus for the death as well. PAP has a different cast\ndepending on whether responsibility for actions, consequences, or\nomissions is at issue. The focus for most of this entry is on actions,\nbut responsibility for consequences and omissions will appear again in\n \u00a75.3.\n\nWhat is it to be morally responsible? This entry adopts a broadly\n\u201cStrawsonian\u201d view in the tradition of P.F.\nStrawson\u2019s \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d (P. F. Strawson\n1962; cp. Fischer & Ravizza 1998, 6\u20138). To be morally\nresponsible is to be the proper object of the \u201creactive\nattitudes,\u201d such as respect, praise, forgiveness, blame,\nindignation, and the like. If Marija is responsible for adopting a\nstray cat, it\u2019s proper to praise her for this act. If it turns\nout Meghan is not responsible for ruining Sean\u2019s tea, then this\nmeans it\u2019s not appropriate, for Sean or anyone else, to blame or\nresent her for what she did. There are other theories of moral\nresponsibility (see entry on\n moral responsibility).\n What our principle looks like under these alternative accounts will\nremain open, though one can expect that problems similar to those\nconsidered below will arise on any but the most radically revisionary\nways of thinking of responsibility.\n\nOne final note on responsibility: In the literature one sometimes\nfinds the notion of true or ultimate moral\nresponsibility (Klein 1990; G. Strawson 1994; Kane 1996). It\u2019s\nnot always clear how this is related to what PAP calls, simply, moral\nresponsibility (M. Bernstein 2005; Boxer 2013). On one reading,\nultimacy is an additional condition on ordinary responsibility to be\nlisted alongside epistemic and other requirements alluded to earlier.\nOn the other hand, if talk of ultimacy is intended to signal a higher\ngrade of responsibility, there will be a corresponding version of our\nprinciple to be evaluated on its own terms:\n\n\nPAP-ultimate: a person is ultimately morally\nresponsible for what she has done only if she could have done\notherwise.\n\n\nThis enhanced version, if it\u2019s distinct from PAP, will not\nappear in what follows. But the discussion below could be relevant to\nPAP-ultimate. In particular, it\u2019s likely that PAP entails\nPAP-ultimate, so that arguments considered below for the former\n (\u00a72)\n could be brought in favor of the latter. What\u2019s less clear is\nwhether PAP-ultimate entails PAP. If it doesn\u2019t, then objections\nto the latter\n (\u00a73)\n needn\u2019t damage the former.\n1.3 What is the Ability to Do Otherwise?\n\nWhen a person, S, does something, what is it for her to have\nthe ability to do otherwise? For help we might look to alternative\nlocutions: S can do otherwise; S has the\npower to do otherwise; this is possible for\nS; the world in which S does otherwise is accessible\nto S; doing so is up to S; this is\nopen to S. But without further elaboration, these\naren\u2019t much more than synonyms for what\u2019s to be explained.\nNo theory of ability is adopted here, and for the most part we will\nrely on judgments about ability in particular cases. But a few general\nissues are worth flagging. (See also\n \u00a74.2.1\n and the entry on\n abilities.)\n\nS\u2019s being able to do otherwise is distinct from its\nmerely being possible that S do otherwise. Once Lisa the\nskydiver jumps out her plane, it is (logically) possible that she\nfloat in midair rather than fall. But it\u2019s not in her power to\ndo so: the world in which Lisa floats is not accessible to her. And if\nKurt is brainwashed to steal John\u2019s lunch, then while it\u2019s\npossible that he refrain, he nevertheless can\u2019t. Something must\nbe added to S\u2019s possibly doing something else to ensure\nit\u2019s within S\u2019s power to do so.\n\nAs Hume (1748 [1999: 158]) and others have argued, adding that it\nseems to S as if there are alternatives doesn\u2019t\nseem to help here (Chisholm 1967; Ginet 1990, 90\u20131). While the\nphenomenology of having alternatives\u2014and more generally, of\nagency\u2014is an important topic in its own right (Nagel 1986: ch.\n7; Horgan, Tienson, & Graham 2003), it does not secure the ability\nin question. Fred feels he can overcome the temptation to smoke, then\ndecides to smoke anyway. But it turns out that he could not have\nresisted his craving. Nor is seeming to have alternatives necessary\nfor having them. Fred\u2019s sister Fanny feels she is too weak to\novercome the temptation at noon to smoke, and in fact she does smoke\nat that time. But she was wrong about her own capacities: with just a\nbit of effort, she would have been able to resist.\n\nWhat these agents can or cannot do is relative to a set of facts, not\nall of which need be conscious. In the cases of Fred and Fanny, the\nfacts concern, among other things, the strengths of their cravings and\ntheir respective degrees of will-power. These are held fixed to\nevaluate their abilities. But what other facts are salient? There is\nno consensus on this issue, though it does seem that which facts are\nheld fixed can vary depending on context (Lewis 1976; Horgan 1979;\nUnger 1984). Such context-sensitivity is relevant to the proper\napplication of PAP. Keyne is confronted by a \u201cyour money or your\nlife\u201d mugger, and hands over his wallet. According to PAP,\nwhether Keyne is responsible for doing so turns, in part, on whether\nhe could have refused. So could he have? Considering the example in\none sort of context, we will say Yes: his arm was under his control\nand he was fully aware of what noncompliance involved and how to\nachieve it. But in another sort of context we might say No: Keyne was\nrational and valued his life far more than the money in his wallet, as\nwould any reasonable person such circumstances; fix this cognitive\nbackground, and the mugger\u2019s demand left him no other option. So\nin handing over his wallet, has Keyne met PAP\u2019s requirement on\nresponsibility or not? There seems to be no clear answer to this\nquestion. Complicating matters still further is that ability\u2014and\nin particular, the ability to do otherwise\u2014varies along a\ncontinuum. The motive power of a threat, mental disorder, or hypnotic\nsuggestion varies from mild to overwhelming. Where along this\ncontinuum does its influence becomes so strong as to preclude\nalternatives? There is no non-arbitrary line to draw here\u2014nor,\napparently, has science settled on one (Graham 2013: 186, citing Morse\n2011).\n\nThese points can make it difficult to test or apply PAP in particular\ncases. However, they do not by themselves entail that PAP is false, so\nlong as judgments of moral responsibility show a similar\ncontext-sensitivity and gradation. (On degrees of responsibility, see\nZimmerman 1988: ch. 3; Coates & Swenson 2013; Nelkin 2016.)\n1.4 A Note on Freedom\n\nA final preliminary point concerns acting freely. A principle\nclosely related to PAP is the following (Audi 1974; van Inwagen 1983:\n161; Widerker & McKenna 2003: 2):\n\n\nFreedom Condition: a person is morally responsible\nfor what she has done only if she did it freely.\n\n\nThis principle raises many of the issues that will come up below. But\nit\u2019s stronger than PAP if, as is plausible, freedom requires\nmore than alternatives (see entry on\n free will).\n Being the source of one\u2019s action may be one such requirement;\nhaving properly functioning faculties could be another; agent-causing\none\u2019s action may be yet another. Investigating the Freedom\nCondition would thus bring in additional topics that cannot be\nexplored here. So the discussion to follow will skirt the problems of\nfree action (and free will) and instead focus on PAP\u2019s weaker\nrequirement. But at least this much is worth noting: if PAP is false,\nthen so is the Freedom Condition, assuming that one must have\nalternatives to act freely (see also Warfield 2007; McKenna 2008:\n353).\n2. Arguments for PAP\n\nMuch of the literature on PAP consists of arguments against it,\nfollowed by replies to those arguments, and so on. Perhaps this\npattern is due to the strong prima facie plausibility the\nprinciple enjoys: it should be accepted unless there are good reasons\nnot to. That said, there are a few positive arguments to advance in\nfavor of PAP; it\u2019s best to begin with those before turning to\nobjections in\n \u00a73.\n2.1 Is the Principle Self-Evident?\n\nOne quick argument is that PAP is self-evident; alternatively, it is\nimmediately known a priori, intuitively obvious, or analytic.\nThose who deny it are thereby convicted of confusion about moral\nresponsibility, the ability to do otherwise, or both. If PAP does\nenjoy such a high epistemic status, this explains its wide acceptance\nin the major historical periods of philosophy, a discipline not\nusually known for producing even approximate consensus. But in spite\nof this agreement, the principle has turned out not to be so obvious,\nand in fact appears to make a substantive, controversial claim about\nresponsibility. Witness some notable dissenters, including the Stoics,\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Hobbes (see, respectively,\n \u00a73.2;\n Hunt 1999; Stump 1997; Martinich 2005). Moreover, PAP has come under\nsustained attack in recent decades due in large part to the early\nefforts of Frankfurt (1969), Fischer (1982), and Dennett (1984a,b).\nThis is enough to show that, however plausible PAP might first appear,\nit requires more than this quick defense.\n2.2 Ordinary Judgments about Responsibility\n\nPAP is supported by a wide range of cases in which we judge that\nwithout alternatives, we are not responsible for acting\u2014not\nresponsible, it seems, because we lack alternatives.\n\nConsider persons with mental disorders such as kleptomania or\nagoraphobia. When these disorders are considered severe enough to\ncompel behavior, blame and resentment no longer seem warranted. (It is\nthe reasoning employed in ordinary judgment that\u2019s relevant\nhere, but for scientific evidence against the compulsion of some\nmental disorders, see Schroeder 2005; Vranas 2007; Pickard 2015.)\nSimilarly, we may be less inclined to condemn a criminal when we\ndiscover that his illegal acts were the result of a brain tumor\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 2012), or to praise the generosity of person who is\ncompelled to give things away (Bennett 2008). Those who, whether\npathologically or not, act from overwhelming stress, fear, or guilt\nare not praised or blamed for what they do. And while young children\nmay have a limited capacity for self-control (Duckworth, Gendler,\n& Gross 2014), among the many reasons we don\u2019t hold them\nmorally responsible is that we think they are often powerless to\nresist their impulses.\n\nSimilar lessons can be drawn from cases of manipulation, in which\nagents are influenced through physical or psychological means.\nExamples of the latter include brainwashing, hypnosis, and duress. One\nmight also include more high-tech examples in which the manipulation\noccurs via direct control of the victim\u2019s brain. (Such examples\nare usually science-fiction, but see Krug, Salzman, & Waddell\n2015.) The extent to which manipulation involves removing, rather than\nmerely reducing, alternatives depends on the mechanism at work. But\ninsofar as we take such examples to involve the blocking of\nalternatives, we take them to rule out responsibility as well.\n\nIn reply, an opponent of PAP may concede that in all such cases, both\nresponsibility and alternatives are diminished or absent, yet still\ndeny that we can generalize from these to PAP, for in addition to\nlacking alternatives, these agents are missing other important moral\nor psychological capacities. It could be the absence of these, not the\nlack of alternatives, that explains why these agents aren\u2019t\nresponsible (cp. Wallace 1994: ch. 5). Put another way: perhaps having\nalternatives is merely correlated in ordinary circumstances with the\ntrue requirements for responsibility, whatever those might be. A more\nrefined test of PAP needs to look at more exotic scenarios in which\nthese other conditions are present while alternatives are not\n (\u00a73.4;\n see\n \u00a74.1\n for more on \u201cordinary circumstances\u201d).\n2.3 The Nature of Agency\n\nAmong the goals of action theory is to distinguish what we do from\nwhat merely happens to us (see, e.g., Davidson 1980: ch. 3). Suppose\nthat on the best way to draw this distinction, action (agency)\nrequires alternatives. Some event in your life, that is, doesn\u2019t\ncount as something you did unless an alternative was within\nyour power. For example, when you\u2019re awakened by a noise, this\nis not an event you could have avoided, and so it was not an action,\nnot an exercise of your agency. Similarly, events such as stumbling,\nsweating, and blushing aren\u2019t things you (strictly) do: they\nhappen to you. To this list we could add mental events such as\nobsessive thoughts: when such thoughts are, in the relevant sense,\nunavoidable, they belong to the sufferer only in the sense that the\nperson is their subject, the arena in which they occur, not their\nagent. Given this view of action, PAP follows immediately: if action\nrequires alternatives, then a fortiori, action for which one\nis morally responsible requires them.\n\nThis line of defense finds a home in some versions of agent-causalism,\non which, not just free action, but action simpliciter\nrequires agent causation (Taylor 1966; Steward 2012b; Brent 2017). On\nthis picture, the difference between what I do and what merely happens\nto me is that I am the (or a) cause of the former, not the latter. Now\nadd a second, logically independent premise that agent causation\nrequires alternatives. If someone is necessitated, either internally\nor externally, it is the compelling factor, not the agent, that causes\nthe resulting event, which thus is not an action. Not all agent\ncausalists endorse both premises (Clarke 1993 and O\u2019Connor 2000\ndeny that action simpliciter requires agent causation; Taylor 1966 and\nMarkosian 2012 deny that agent causation requires alternatives). But\njoining the premises entails that action\u2014and thus morally\nresponsible action\u2014requires alternatives.\n\nThis approach to defending PAP will have to say something about\napparent actions that do not involve alternatives. When an addict\ntakes a drug due to an irresistible urge to do so, it seems this is\nsomething the addict does, even if the addict can\u2019t resist. (For\na reply to such examples, see Alvarez 2013.) Similarly, the view\nentails that if causal determinism or some other universal block of\nalternatives is in place, no one ever acts; whether this is an\nacceptable consequence is disputed (Shabo 2011; Steward 2012a).\n2.4 Moral Arguments\n\nA broader concern about the previous defense is that it grounds our\nprinciple in the metaphysics of agency rather than in the nature of\nmoral responsibility. Morality, the thought goes, should be more\ndirectly engaged in defense of PAP, a principle that explicitly\nconstrains our practices of praise and blame. It\u2019s not\nsurprising, then, that a number of arguments supporting PAP start from\nmoral premises.\n\nA straightforward moral argument says it\u2019s not fair to praise or\nblame a person for doing something that was, for her, unavoidable (for\ndiscussion see, e.g., Glover 1970: 70\u20133; Watson 1996; Nelkin\n2011: ch. 2). A responsible agent is a proper target of the\nreactive attitudes, and unfairly or unjustly blaming someone, however\nexpedient, would not be morally proper. One challenge for this defense\nof PAP is that fairness is itself entangled with the reactive\nattitudes (P. F. Strawson 1962; cp. Wallace 1994: 4.3). Thus, those\nwho wonder whether praise and blame require alternatives are unlikely\nto be persuaded by the claim that fair targeting by the\nreactive attitudes requires alternatives\u2014at least not without\nfurther argument. Someone questioning PAP, that is, is unlikely to be\nswayed by a moral appeal that seems only to reassert the\nprinciple.\n\nAnother line appeals to the principle, often associated with Kant\n(1785), that \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan\u201d (OIC). You\ncannot be morally obligated to do something that\u2019s impossible\nfor you. While it would be good for you to eradicate world hunger, you\nare under no obligation to do so for the simple reason that you\ncan\u2019t. (You may, however, be obligated to relieve hunger to the\nextent you can.) Perhaps OIC is not, as Reid thought, \u201cas\nself-evident as the axioms of mathematics\u201d (Reid 1788: IV.v),\nbut it is nevertheless very plausible.\n\nNow return to PAP. Suppose Kristin robs a bank. A first try at the\nargument runs as follows (here we take refraining from doing\nsomething to be a way doing something else; for a bit more on this,\nsee\n \u00a74.2.2):\n\nP1.\n If Kristin is blameworthy for robbing the bank, then she ought\nnot to have done so.\nP2. \n If Kristin ought not to have robbed the bank, then she could have\nrefrained from doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if Kristin is blameworthy for robbing the bank, then\nshe could have refrained from doing so.\n\n\nP1 looks safe, assuming that the moral sense of blame is in play (but\nsee Capes 2012; Haji 2019). P2 is an instance of OIC. However, the\nconclusion, even when generalized, stops short of PAP, as it claims\nmerely that alternatives are necessary for actions for which one is\nmorally blameworthy; it is silent on actions for which one is morally\npraiseworthy, and it\u2019s harder to see how OIC could be leveraged\nto cover such actions (Frankfurt 1983). After all, when you do\nsomething praiseworthy, you act as you should, so OIC can\u2019t get\na grip on alternative courses of action. That said, if some version of\nthe above argument were sound, this would be a major victory for\nproponents of PAP. (Compare C. A. Campbell 1951: 451; van Inwagen\n1983: 161; Widerker 1991; Copp 1997; critics include Yaffe 1999, 2005;\nsee also Widerker 2003; Speak 2005.)\n\nA third moral argument for PAP is closely related to the first two. It\nis the \u201cWhat-should-he-have-done defense,\u201d or\n\u201cW-defense\u201d for short (Widerker 2003). Like the argument\nin the previous paragraph, the W-defense is designed to apply to\nactions for which an agent is morally blameworthy. If Trent is to be\nblamed for loudly coughing during Maggie\u2019s lecture, it\u2019s\nmorally reasonable to expect him to have refrained from coughing. But\nthe central thought is that this expectation is not morally\nreasonable if he couldn\u2019t help himself due to, say, a\nbug\u2019s flying into his mouth. \u201cWhat would you have had me\ndo?,\u201d he might ask a peeved Maggie. Without any satisfactory\nanswer to such a question, blame seems inappropriate.\n3. Arguments against PAP\n\nLike most of the important conceptual claims of philosophy, PAP has\nproved to be a tempting target, especially to philosophers wanting to\navoid its potential threat to responsibility\n (\u00a71.1).\n3.1 The Irrelevance of Determinism\n\nAs noted earlier\n (\u00a72.2),\n it looks as if PAP is supported by our ordinary practices of praise\nand blame. In particular, those who could not avoid what they\u2019ve\ndone are excused. But despite these initial appearances, ordinary\npractices might end up undermining the principle.\n\nConsider again causal determinism, a thesis often thought to rule out\nalternatives. Determinism is a substantive empirical claim, and no\none, certainly no ordinary person, knows whether it\u2019s true (see\nentry on\n causal determinism).\n It appears, then, that if we presuppose PAP in ordinary life, we\nshould for the time being withhold judgment on whether any person is\nresponsible for her actions, cautiously awaiting a verdict from\nscientists on the question of determinism. But, the argument goes, it\nwould be absurd to think we have to wait for scientific progress to\ndecide whether, say, Kevin should be grateful to Denise for picking up\nhis mail when he was on vacation, or a victim of fraud should blame\nthe con artist. These and similar reactions are justified however\nthings turn out in the recherch\u00e9 domain of\nmicro-physics. Determinism\u2019s threatened block of alternatives is\nirrelevant to whether someone should be praised or blamed (P. F.\nStrawson 1962; Dennett 1984b: ch. 6; Fischer 2006: 5).\n\nIn reply, PAP\u2019s defenders might take a cue from contextualists\nand say that in ordinary contexts, determinism is routinely (and\nproperly) ignored. This would explain why micro-physics never appears\nin ordinary thinking about responsibility, but in a way compatible\nwith our recognizing PAP\u2019s truth: if determinism were to become\nsalient\u2014as it is in philosophical and scientific\ncontexts\u2014its block of alternatives would cause us to\nretract our ordinary judgments (cp. Hawthorne 2001). Another option is\nto say that we ordinarily assume\u2014even if we don\u2019t yet\nknow\u2014that determinism is false (Wiggins 1973: \u00a78), and with\nthis we normally take ourselves to have alternatives. Perhaps if we\nbecame determinists, we would stop our practices of praise and blame,\nor at least stop thinking they were justified, precisely because we\nendorse PAP or some closely related principle. There is a growing\nexperimental literature on whether we would attribute moral\nresponsibility under the explicit assumption of determinism, but the\nresults so far seem to be mixed (Sommers 2010; Nichols 2015: ch.\n4).\n3.2 Compelled but Willing Action\n\nThe previous section tried to undermine PAP by arguing that our\npractices of praise and blame are neutral on whether we have\nalternatives. A more direct line of attack\u2014to explored in this\nand following sections\u2014tries to produce cases in which we\nproperly praise or blame agents even while knowing they lack\nalternatives.\n\nOne sort of example is from the Stoics (Inwood & Gerson 1988:\n134). Imagine a dog happily running behind a cart to which he is\nchained. The cart makes the dog\u2019s running inevitable\u2014he\ncannot do otherwise\u2014yet he nevertheless runs willingly. Whatever\nexactly the Stoics meant by this example (Sauv\u00e9 Meyer 1999;\nHankinson 2014), an opponent of PAP may be inspired to argue by\nanalogy that necessity or \u201cfate\u201d doesn\u2019t preclude\nresponsibility. Even if Kurt is fated to steal John\u2019s lunch,\nhe\u2019s still responsible for doing so if he acts willingly: even\nif fate \u201cpulls\u201d him along like the cart, he could be a\nhappy and contributing participant. Similarly, imagine a drug user\nwhose addiction compels him to take a drug, but who doesn\u2019t mind\nbeing addicted, and thus indulges willingly. The addict is responsible\nfor taking the drug, even if he couldn\u2019t do otherwise (Frankfurt\n1971; cf. Wallace 1994: 172\u20135; the irresistible addiction, while\nperhaps useful for making such conceptual points, appears not to match\nactual cases of addiction: see Levy 2006; Pickard 2015.)\n\nThat said, the power of such examples against PAP is limited, as they\ninvolve the sorts of compulsion usually thought to preclude\nresponsibility (cp. Lamb 1993). At best these are examples of\noverdetermination: responsibility-undermining factors are at work,\neven if the agent\u2019s own character and values play a (redundant)\nrole in producing the action. A kind of case to be considered next,\nhowever, may be more effective.\n3.3 Volitional Necessity\n\nBrought before Charles V and ordered to recant, Luther refused, saying\n(according to tradition), \u201cHere I stand. I can do no\nother\u201d. If we can take his word for it, Luther was compelled by\nhis conscience. Yet we still praise him for refusing, in spite of his\ninability to do otherwise. Indeed, his being compelled by conscience\nmay enhance our moral admiration. Such cases of \u201cvolitional\nnecessity\u201d (Frankfurt 1982) are prima facie\ncounterexamples to PAP. Sometimes when we act, alternatives are\n\u201cunthinkable\u201d: if a normal person is offered money to\ntorture someone, that person will have no option but to refuse\n(Dennett 1984a). Again, this lack of alternatives is compatible with,\nand even enhances, moral praise. (See also Wolf 1980; Nelkin 2011, in\nwhich the goodness of the determined act plays an important role.)\nSuch cases are similar to the compelled actions considered in the\nprevious section, but there\u2019s at least this difference: in those\nearlier cases, what compels is something \u201calien\u201d to the\nagent: a cart, fate, an irresistible desire for a drug. But here,\ncompulsion comes only from the agent\u2019s own internalized system\nof values. This might explain why praise is more forthcoming.\n\nNevertheless, a defender of PAP could question whether such agents are\nresponsible in the sense we\u2019re concerned with here. Reid notes\nthat Cato was said to be \u201cgood because he could not be\notherwise\u201d. Reid replies: \n\n\nthis saying, if understood literally and strictly, is not the praise\nof Cato, but of his constitution, which was no more the work of Cato,\nthan his existence. (Reid 1788, IV.1; quoted in Chisholm 1966) \n\n\nPraising Cato\u2019s character, we conflate this with moral credit\nand thereby hold him responsible. Carefully avoid this mistake, and\ncases of volitional necessity no longer appear to be counterexamples\nto PAP.\n\nBut a more common reply to such examples is to clarify our principle\nby allowing the relevant alternatives to occur before the time of\nacting. Insofar as Luther should be praised for his refusal,\nit\u2019s because the character compelling the action was itself the\nresult of Luther\u2019s past choices in which he could have done\notherwise. This important qualification to PAP, sometimes called\n\u201ctracing\u201d, has been standard since Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics iii.v; cp. John Locke 1689: II.xxi.56; C.\nA. Campbell 1957; Lamb 1993; Kane 1996: 39\u201340). Only by moral\nstruggle, choosing a certain path among the many available, did Luther\nfinally arrive at a point in which his character and conscience\nnecessitated his actions. In light of this, let us formulate PAP with\nan additional clause (closely following Mele 1999: 282):\n\n\nPAP-historical: a person is morally responsible for\nwhat she has done at time t only if (i) she could have done\notherwise at t, or (ii) even though she could not have done\notherwise at t, the psychological character on the basis of\nwhich she acted at t is itself partially a product of an\nearlier action (or actions) of hers which was performed at a time when\nshe could have done otherwise.\n\n\nThis less demanding version of PAP was needed all along, even for more\nordinary cases. Tom, who becomes violent when drunk, couldn\u2019t\nhelp himself when he punched someone: Tom\u2019s intoxication put him\nat the mercy of his anger. Yet, assuming other conditions on\nresponsibility are met, we should blame him, especially when learning\nthat he willingly drank beforehand. It\u2019s the prior act of\ndrinking for which Tom had alternatives, and it\u2019s these\nalternatives, not those at the time of action, that satisfy our new\ncondition.\n\nHenceforth let PAP and similar principles have such a historical\nrider, at least implicitly (so \u201cPAP\u201d below can be read as\nshort for \u201cPAP-historical\u201d). The principle\u2019s\ndefenders can then allow a wide range of cases\u2014willing\nincapacitation, moral saintliness, confrontation with the\n\u201cunthinkable\u201d\u2014in which a person is responsible for\nacting without, at the time, having alternatives. To test PAP, then,\none must go to \u201cthe source\u201d and look at cases in which the\nhistorical clause is not relevant to the agent\u2019s moral\nresponsibility. Stipulate that the actions to be considered below,\nunless otherwise stated, are those for which, if the agent is\nresponsible at all, she is \u201cdirectly\u201d responsible\n(Zimmerman 1988: ch. 3). Perhaps such actions are what Kane (1996)\ncalls \u201cself-forming willings\u201d, foundational choices that\nshape the characters that later constrain, or even fix, future action\n(cp. Klein 1990: 58).\n3.4 Inevitability without Causation\n\nAccording to Frankfurt (1983: 322), \n\n\n[c]onstructing counterexamples to PAP is not difficult. It is\nnecessary only to conceive circumstances which make it inevitable that\na person will perform some action but which do not bring it about that\nhe performs it. \n\n\nFrankfurt himself proposed examples of this sort, and they have\ninspired a massive literature, a portion of which is discussed below.\nBut before we get to Frankfurt\u2019s own examples, others in the\nsame neighborhood are worth looking at.\n3.4.1 Divine Foreknowledge\n\nAs noted earlier\n (\u00a71.1),\n PAP threatens to join with divine foreknowledge to rule out moral\nresponsibility. The reasoning starts like this:\n\nP1.\n If God knew a billion years ago that Kurt would steal\nJohn\u2019s lunch, then Kurt could not have done otherwise.\nP2. \n If Kurt could not have done otherwise than steal John\u2019s\nlunch, then he was not morally responsible for doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if God knew a billion years ago that Kurt would steal\nJohn\u2019s lunch, then Kurt was not morally responsible for doing\nso.\n\n\nAdding the thesis of divine foreknowledge as a premise would let us\ncomplete the argument, but this initial stage is what matters here.\nThe conclusion looks false. After all, God\u2019s foreknowledge\ndidn\u2019t cause Kurt to act as he does. God merely saw ahead of\ntime that Kurt would do this on his own, for his own reasons. By\nanalogy, my covertly observing Kurt as he steals John\u2019s lunch\ndoes not affect his responsibility for the theft. Why then should\nGod\u2019s being aware of that same act (albeit ahead of time) make\nany difference to whether he should be blamed?\n\nSuppose this case against C is convincing. The above argument is\nvalid, so either P1 or P2 must be rejected. P1, however, is supported\nby a venerable line of reasoning, which goes roughly as follows:\nSupposing that God foreknew Kurt\u2019s action, if Kurt had the power\nto refrain from stealing John\u2019s lunch, he would thereby have the\npower to change what God knew a billion years ago. But Kurt has no\nsuch power, as the past is fixed. If this argument for P1 is sound,\nthen P2 is the culprit. But P2 is entailed by PAP, so PAP is false as\nwell.\n\nThis case against PAP follows Frankfurt\u2019s recipe for\nconstructing counterexamples (Hunt 1996, 1999; but cf. Zagzebski 1991:\nch. 6; Widerker 2000: 187\u20138). God\u2019s foreknowledge makes it\n\u201cinevitable\u201d that Kurt will steal John\u2019s lunch, but\ndoes not \u201cbring it about\u201d that he does so: Kurt steals on\nhis own, without divine interference. Evaluating this proposed\ncounterexample would lead us beyond this scope of this entry into the\ntopic of divine foreknowledge (see entry on\n divine foreknowledge and free will).\n But some of the moves one might make here will come up later when\nreplies to Frankfurt\u2019s own proposed counterexamples are\nconsidered.\n3.4.2 Locke\u2019s Content Prisoner\n\nIn the Essay Locke asks us to imagine that\n\n\na man be carried, whilst fast asleep, into a room, where is a person\nhe longs to see and speak with; and be there locked fast in, beyond\nhis power to get out: he awakes, and is glad to find himself in so\ndesirable company, which he stays willingly in, i.e., prefers his stay\nto going away. (J. Locke 1689: II.xxi.10)\n\n\nLocke says the man remains in the room voluntarily, even if he is not\nfree to leave. If the man is responsible for staying, this is a\ncounterexample to PAP. Like the previous example, this one also\nappears to follow Frankfurt\u2019s recipe. What makes the man\u2019s\nstaying in the room unavoidable\u2014namely, the room\u2019s being\nlocked\u2014plays no role in his staying: he remains willingly, for\nhis own reasons (see Zimmerman 1988: 120\u20136 for a similar\nexample).\n\nWhile Locke\u2019s example shaped later discussions of moral\nresponsibility, it appears that\u2014whatever Locke\nintended\u2014it\u2019s not decisive against PAP. Distinguish two of\nthe man\u2019s actions: (A1) staying in the room, and (A2) deciding\n(agreeing, willing) to stay in the room (Lowe 1995: 131). It\u2019s\nnot at all clear that he should be blamed for A1; the room is, after\nall, locked. On the other hand, it seems he can be blamed for A2. But\nhe could have done otherwise than A2: he could have protested or tried\nto get out. Whatever apparent pressure the example puts on PAP derives\nfrom conflating A1 and A2. There is no action of the man that\u2019s\nboth unavoidable (for him) and one for which we should hold him\nmorally responsible.\n3.4.3 Frankfurt-Style Cases\n\nSo far we\u2019ve looked at two sorts of proposed counterexample to\nPAP that follow Frankfurt\u2019s recipe. Frankfurt\u2019s own\nexamples, and those they inspired, have come to be known as\n\u201cFrankfurt-Style Cases\u201d (FSCs). Here is one:\n\n\n\u2026let us say that a person decides to take and does take a\ncertain drug, just in order to enjoy the euphoria he expects it to\ninduce. Now suppose further that his taking the drug would have been\nmade to happen in any case, by forces which were in fact inactive but\nwhich would have come into play if he had not on his own decided and\nacted as he did. Let us say that, unknown to himself, the person is\naddicted to the drug and would therefore have been driven irresistibly\nto take it if he had not freely gone about doing so. His dormant\naddiction guarantees that he could have avoided neither deciding to\ntake nor taking the drug, but it plays no role in bringing about his\ndecision or his act. As the actual sequence of events develops,\neverything happens as if he were not addicted at all. The addiction is\nclearly irrelevant in this case to the question of whether the person\nis morally responsible for taking the drug. (Frankfurt 1983:\n322\u20133)\n\n\nThis person resembles the willing addict considered earlier\n (\u00a73.2),\n except in this case the addiction remains dormant. He takes the drug\non his own, for his own reasons. He thus seems morally responsible for\ndeciding to take the drug and for taking it. Yet both decision and\naction were inevitable, for the addiction would have forced him had he\nnot chosen on his own to do so.\n\nA more well-known FSC comes in an earlier paper (Frankfurt 1969;\nFrankfurt credits Robert Nozick\u2019s unpublished lectures for\nsimilar examples). In what follows, it will be useful to consider a\nversion of Frankfurt\u2019s example from Fischer:\n\n\nBlack is a nefarious neurosurgeon. In performing an operation on Jones\nto remove a brain tumor, Black inserts a mechanism into Jones\u2019s\nbrain which enables Black to monitor and control Jones\u2019s\nactivities. Jones, meanwhile, knows nothing of this. Black exercises\nthis control through a computer which he has programmed so that, among\nother things, it monitors Jones\u2019s voting behavior. If Jones\nshows an inclination to decide to vote for [the Democrat], then the\ncomputer, through the mechanism in Jones\u2019s brain, intervenes to\nassure that he actually decides to vote for [the Republican], and does\nso vote. But if Jones decides on his own to vote for [the Republican],\nthe computer does nothing but continue to monitor\u2014without\naffecting\u2014the goings-on in Jones\u2019s head.\n\nSuppose Jones decides to vote for [the Republican] on his own, just as\nhe would have if Black had not inserted the mechanism into\nhis head. Then Frankfurt claims that Jones is responsible for voting\nfor [the Republican], regardless of the fact that he could not have\ndone otherwise. (Fischer 1982: 26; cp. Frankfurt 1969:\n835\u2013836)\n\n\nComplicating details will come in later sections, but for now\nit\u2019s worth noting two advantages of this kind of example. First,\nunlike some of the earlier attempts to undermine PAP, there is no\nfactor, internal to the agent or otherwise, compelling the action.\nWhat makes an action inevitable\u2014the dormant addiction in one\ncase, Black and his computer in another\u2014in no way brings about\nthe action, which the agent does for his own reasons. This makes\npraise or blame more natural. Second, unlike the case of Locke\u2019s\nprisoner, FSCs do not invite us to conflate decision and overt action,\nfor it is the decision itself (as well as the action) that is both\ninevitable and that for which the agent is morally responsible.\n4. Objections to Frankfurt-Style Cases\n\nNot everyone is impressed by Frankfurt\u2019s proposed\ncounterexamples and the FSCs he inspired. Some critics concede that\nPAP is false, but insist that some neighboring principle\u2014one\nthat will serve many of the same purposes as PAP\u2014is immune to\nFrankfurt\u2019s examples. Others attack FSCs directly, arguing that\nthe examples fail to show even that PAP is false. The critical\nliterature is too large to cover in detail here, but this section\noutlines a few broad themes. (Among the many useful surveys are\nFischer 1999, 2011; Sartorio 2017; and the pertinent chapters of\nBeebee 2013; Griffith 2013; Timpe 2013.)\n4.1 The Cases are Too Unusual\n\nFSCs are philosophical thought-experiments, often involving science\nfiction and covert figures with mysterious powers and unlikely\nobsessions. The growing literature on FSCs continues this pattern (for\na sampling, see Widerker & McKenna 2003). As the cases get\nincreasingly \u201cstrange and esoteric\u201d (Kane 2007: 168),\nachieving \u201cdizzying degrees of development\u201d (Speak 2002:\n98), we might start to wonder whether we\u2019ve lost sight of the\ngoal, which is to understand concepts originating, not in\nphilosophical fantasy, but in everyday life and ordinary\ncircumstances. However things look in the distant possible worlds of\nFSCs, our natural practices and judgments of moral responsibility\nrequire alternatives.\n\nThis suggestion could play out in a few ways. One is to concede that\nFSCs have refuted PAP, but to insist that the principle\u2014much\nlike Newtonian theory in the domain of physics\u2014is still good\nenough for our ordinary practices of assigning praise and blame (Stump\n1990). Or one might just abandon PAP as formulated but replace it with\na principle explicitly restricted to ordinary, non-Frankfurt\ncases:\n\n\nPAP-ordinary: in ordinary circumstances, a person is\nmorally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done\notherwise.\n\n\nSuch a principle appears Frankfurt-proof, yet is designed to be just\nas useful to assigning praise and blame as the original\n(O\u2019Connor 2005; Glatz 2008; Perry 2010; Whittle 2016). Finally,\none could say that this sort of restriction was part of PAP all along,\nas the principle gets its content from\u2014and is restricted\nto\u2014our ordinary practices. In that case, PAP-ordinary just is\nthe original PAP, so FSCs were never a threat to begin with.\n\nIn reply, a defender of FSCs could note that not all such cases are so\nfar removed from everyday life. There is nothing especially bizarre\nabout Locke\u2019s content prisoner (an early kind of FSC) or\nFrankfurt\u2019s own example of the dormant addiction. And there is\nno fantastic technology or malevolent being in another FSC, the\n\u201cdriver instruction vehicle\u201d with dual controls: Sally\nsteers her car to the right, which the instructor is happy to allow.\nBut \n\n\nif Sally had shown any inclination to cause the car to go in some\nother direction, the instructor would have intervened and caused the\ncar to go to the right (just as it actually goes). (Fischer &\nRavizza 1998: 32; cp. Naylor 1984) \n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting as well that if traditional theism is true,\nand if divine foreknowledge is an FSC (Hunt 2003), then FSCs, far from\nbeing unusual, are commonplace. That said, all of these more\n\u201cordinary\u201d FSCs still violate background assumptions\nusually in place when persons are praised or blamed. Those favoring\nPAP-ordinary could claim that these examples do not fall within the\nprinciple\u2019s scope.\n\nIn any case, there is a more fundamental reply to the general strategy\nof this section: if FSCs, strange as some of them are, are at least\ncoherent, they do point to a conceptual divide between moral\nresponsibility and alternatives. Even if alternatives are needed for\nresponsibility in ordinary circumstances, FSCs, if successful, show\nthat this is a contingent fact. Fallback principles such as\nPAP-ordinary reveal, at best, that alternatives are usually correlated\nwith responsibility, and tell us little about what it is to\nbe responsible. FSCs could thereby serve an important\ntheoretical role in directing attention away from alternatives to what\nmakes someone responsible for their actions (Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 30; Ekstrom 2000: 184\u20135).\n4.2 Frankfurt Agents Could Have Done Otherwise\n\nA central feature of all FSCs is that the agent could not have done\notherwise. Due to the presence of the (counterfactual) intervener, all\noptions but one are closed. But some have objected that the agent in\nfact can do otherwise, and that it\u2019s this ability that, in\naccordance with PAP, explains why the agent is responsible (assuming\nthat other conditions of responsibility are met). Below are two ways\nFrankfurt agents could turn out to have alternatives after all.\n4.2.1 General Abilities\n\nWilderness Tim finds himself stranded in the middle of nowhere, miles\nfrom any automobile. Can Tim drive a car? Yes and No\n (\u00a71.3).\n He is (for now) healthy, and has not lost any of the skills needed to\ndrive. So in that sense he can. But there are no cars available, so in\nthat sense he cannot. Say then that Tim has the general\nability (capacity, skill, competence) to drive, but he\ncan\u2019t drive in a more inclusive all-in sense, that is,\nwhen his particular circumstances are also taken into account. This\ndistinction between kinds of ability is a staple of action theory\n(e.g., Austin 1956; Goldman 1970: ch. 7; D. Locke 1974; Mele 2003).\nHere we look briefly at its relevance to FSCs.\n\nAs the interveners in FSCs are merely counterfactual, they leave the\ngeneral abilities of their agents intact. Black\u2019s device, for\nexample, merely monitors Jones\u2019 brain: as things turn out,\nbecause matters proceed as Black wishes, he does nothing to affect how\nJones deliberates, decides, or acts. Jones thus retains all of the\ngeneral abilities he would have had if Black had never been present.\n(Stipulate that the device Black places in Jones does not interfere\nwith any relevant processes in Jones\u2019 brain: Black is a\nsupremely talented neurosurgeon.) Assuming Jones is otherwise normal,\nwe can suppose that among his general abilities is that he can vote\nfor the Democrat. So while Jones cannot in a more inclusive sense\nchoose otherwise than to vote for the Republican (that is, when the\npresence of Black and his device are held fixed), Jones can\nchoose to vote for the Democrat in the general sense, and this is\nability enough for responsibility, thus rescuing PAP from such\nexamples. (Variations on this theme include J. K. Campbell 1997, 2005;\nSmith 2003; Vihvelin 2004; Fara 2008.)\n\nIn light of this defense, let us for now formulate our principle\nexplicitly in terms of general abilities, allowing that this might\nhave been what PAP was saying all along:\n\n\nPAP-general: a person is morally responsible for what\nshe has done only if she had the general ability to do otherwise.\n\n\nThis version appears to be immune to FSCs. And it has the added virtue\nof explaining standard cases in which agents are blameless\n (\u00a72.2),\n so long as these can plausibly be construed as involving absent or\ndiminished general abilities. Moreover, compatibilists will note that\ncausal determinism is no longer the threat to moral responsibility it\nfirst appeared to be\n (\u00a71.1;\n but see also\n \u00a75.2).\n After all, determinism does not rob us of our unexercised general\nabilities. For example, even in a deterministic world, during periods\nof silence one typically still has the competence to speak.\nWhy, then, should determinism deprive anyone of the ability\u2014that\nis, the general ability\u2014to do otherwise? The point is ancient\n(Sorabji 1980: 78), but it has received new life and sophisticated\ndefense in the hands of the \u201cnew dispositionalists\u201d or\n\u201cdispositional compatibilists,\u201d so-called because general\nabilities can be equated with dispositions (see entry on\n compatibilism \u00a74.1.5).\n\nOne question this defense raises is whether PAP, now construed as\nPAP-general, is subject to counterexamples similar to FSCs (Cohen\n& Handfield 2007; Whittle 2010). Another is whether this revised\nprinciple reflects the kind of alternatives traditionally thought\nneeded to explain responsibility (McKenna 1998; Kane 2002; Clarke\n2009; Whittle 2010; Fischer 2018; cp. entry on\n abilities \u00a75.2).\n There\u2019s a set of moral practices, and with it a version of PAP,\non which responsibility requires more than just the general ability to\ndo otherwise. It\u2019s apparently this reading of PAP that FSCs are\ntargeting. Even if Frankfurt agents have the relevant general\nabilities, they seem to lack the ability to do otherwise in the sense\ntraditionally\u2014but wrongly, according to Frankfurt and his\nallies\u2014required for responsibility.\n4.2.2 Flickers of Freedom\n\nThe previous section assumed that agents in FSCs cannot do otherwise\nin the more inclusive all-in sense. But a more ambitious line of\nresponse rejects this, insisting that Frankfurt agents can do\notherwise even when their peculiar circumstances are taken into\naccount. Or rather, they have an all-in alternative, one\nthat, however minor, is enough satisfy PAP\u2019s requirement on\nmoral responsibility. These are \u201clittle alternatives\u201d\n(Rowe 2006) or \u201cflickers of freedom\u201d (Fischer 1994).\n\nThere are several versions of this strategy. Here\u2019s one: Black\nremains inactive only because his device detects in Jones no\ninclination to vote for the Democrat. But then it looks as if Jones\nhad an alternative after all: he could have been inclined to vote for\nthe Democrat. This alternative would not have issued in a choice, but\nit is an alternative for all that. But this sort of flicker is not\nespecially useful in defense of PAP. For one thing, it seems to locate\nthe alternative at the wrong time, and regarding the wrong action (if\nindeed an inclination can be considered an action at all). For\nanother, there may be FSCs in which Black does not rely on any such\nprior sign before the moment of choice\n (\u00a74.3.2).\n\nThere are, however, more promising versions of the flicker strategy:\nearly attempts include van Inwagen 1978; Naylor 1984; Rowe 1987. Take\nNaylor\u2019s version to be representative. Black remains inactive\nbecause he sees that Jones will decide on his own to do what Black\nwishes, namely, vote for the Republican. Black would have intervened\notherwise. But doesn\u2019t this mean there\u2019s something Jones\ncould have refrained from doing, namely voting for the Republican\non his own, i.e., without Black\u2019s intervention? This is\nan all-in ability, and it\u2019s because Jones had this alternative\nopen to him that he is rightly held responsible.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s allies may concede there are such flickers of\nfreedom, but deny that they are sufficiently \u201crobust\u201d to\nground our judgments of moral responsibility (Fischer 1994:\n140\u20137; 1999). Grant that Jones could do otherwise than choose to\nvote for the Republican on his own. But this alleged alternative is\none in which Jones doesn\u2019t choose at all: rather, in this\ncounterfactual scenario, it is Black who, by activating the neural\nimplant, causes a \u201cchoice\u201d to vote for the Republican.\nHow, then, could an alternative in which Jones doesn\u2019t\nact\u2014one in which he is merely Black\u2019s puppet\u2014be\nrelevant to Jones\u2019s responsibility in the actual scenario? Put\nanother way: the alternative in question is merely one in which\nsomething else happens to Jones; it is not one in which he\ndoes anything. This cannot be the kind of alternative PAP\nrequires for responsibility. The existence of flickers, it seems,\ncannot save PAP from FSCs.\n\nIn reply, some of PAP\u2019s defenders have asked whether\nalternatives need to be robust in this sense. Perhaps Jones\u2019\nalternative, however small, can ground his responsibility, not by\nbeing an alternative action, but by indicating that Jones was not\ndetermined to act as he did (Mele 1996; Della Rocca 1998; Ekstrom\n2000: 190). A more ambitious response notes that even if Black\nintervenes in the alternative scenario, Jones has there\nrefrained from choosing\u2014at least he\u2019s refrained\nfrom the particular choosing we see in the actual scenario. If we can\nconsider such refrainings as \u201cdoings\u201d in some broad sense\nof the term, then this is a sense in which Jones does otherwise in the\nalternative scenario. \u201cRobust\u201d or not, this may be the\nonly kind of alternative that flicker theorists need (cp. Alvarez\n2009; Steward 2009; 2012a;\n \u00a75.3.1;\n see also Speak 2002; Capes & Swenson 2017).\n4.3 A Dilemma for Frankfurt-Style Cases\n\nAn influential criticism of FSCs is in the form of a dilemma, one that\nbecomes clear when we look more closely at how FSCs are supposed to\nwork. Below is one version of this dilemma, followed by two broad\ncategories of response.\n4.3.1 The Dilemma Stated\n\nAlthough it is not always explicit in FSCs, the counterfactual\nintervener appears to reply on some prior sign of what the agent is\nabout to do (Blumenfeld 1971). Black\u2019s device, for example, is\nsensitive to Jones\u2019 inclination: if it detects an inclination\n(call it \u201cPro-D\u201d) to choose the Democrat, Black will\nintervene; if it detects an inclination (\u201cPro-R\u201d) to\nchoose the Republican, Black will remain idle. As matters turn out,\nPro-R appears, Black does nothing, and Jones votes for the Republican\non his own. The dilemma is this: either Pro-R determines (or is\nassociated with something that determines\u2014a qualification to be\nleft out for simplicity) that Jones will vote for the Republican, or\nit doesn\u2019t. Either way, the FSC fails as a counterexample to\nPAP.\n\nSuppose first that Pro-R determines Jones\u2019 choice. In that case,\nit\u2019s no longer clear that Jones is responsible, for he\u2019s\nbeen locked into his choice by a prior cause. Certainly PAPs\ndefenders\u2014who tend to be libertarians about free will and moral\nresponsibility\u2014will balk at attributing responsibility to an\nagent whose actions are causally determined. Lost, then, is the\ninitially powerful appearance that Jones is morally responsible. On\nthe other hand, suppose Pro-R does not determine Jones\u2019 later\nchoice. In that case, Jones could have chosen otherwise, for the\nsign\u2014the only thing that stays Black\u2019s\nhand\u2014leaves open that Jones will vote for the Democrat. Jones\nthus has an alternative, and a robust one at that: this is no mere\nflicker.\n\nThe upshot is that there is no way of spelling out the details of this\nFSC in a way that preserves both the responsibility of the agent and\nthe lack of alternatives. Yet both are need for it to be a successful\ncounterexample. If all FSCs are structurally similar to this one, they\nare powerless against PAP. (Versions of this \u201cdilemma\ndefense\u201d include Kane 1985: 51; 1996: 142\u20133, 191\u20132;\nWiderker 1995; Ginet 1996; Wyma 1997; cp. Ekstrom 2000: 197 for a\nsimilar dilemma; and see Haji & McKenna 2004 for a critical\noverview. Vihvelin 2000 presents a different dilemma for FSCs, one\nthat nevertheless engages some of issues that will come up below; for\nan exchange on that alternative dilemma, see Fischer 2008; Vihvelin\n2008.)\n4.3.2 Responses to the Dilemma\n\nStart with the first horn and stipulate that Pro-R is a deterministic\ncause of Jones\u2019 subsequent choice. But to prevent the\nlibertarian from objecting immediately, let us suppose that\nJones\u2019 responsibility for his choice is not clear; indeed, we\ncan suppose\u2014even if initially shocking to Frankfurt\u2019s\nallies\u2014that he\u2019s not responsible for it.\nNevertheless, his being blameless is not due to something, namely\nBlack and his device, that rules out alternatives. In the actual\nscenario, Black remains passive, merely monitoring Jones\u2019 brain\nwithout interfering. The central idea here is that any factor causally\nisolated from an agent cannot be relevant to that person\u2019s moral\nresponsibility. So even if Jones isn\u2019t responsible,\nthis isn\u2019t entailed by his lacking alternatives; this\nwould be enough to refute PAP. (Fischer 1999: 113; cp. Frankfurt 2003.\nThis is just a first pass at what turns out to be a much more complex\nargument. For further refinement and criticism, see Goetz 2005;\nFischer 2010; Widerker & Goetz 2013; Fischer 2013; Palmer\n2014.)\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s defenders more often take on the second horn, on\nwhich Pro-R is not causally sufficient for Jones\u2019 choice. This\nmakes his responsibility clearer, especially for libertarians. But now\nit seems as if he could choose otherwise.\n\nPereboom (2001: ch. 1; see also Hunt 2005) replies that even with an\nindeterministic sign, we can construct a successful FSC in which Jones\nlacks alternatives. For variety, switch for a moment to\nPereboom\u2019s \u201cTax Evasion,\u201d though one could construct\nthe Black-Jones case to make similar points. Joe is an agent with\nlibertarian freedom who is considering whether to claim an illegal tax\ndeduction. He\u2019s inclined to do so, and as he deliberates, the\nonly factor that could potentially change his mind is a strong moral\nreason. Whether such a reason occurs to Joe is not determined (cp.\nMele 1995: ch. 12), and even if it does occur to him, it may not\nchange his mind. But at least a necessary condition of his\nchoosing not to evade taxes is the occurrence of such a reason\n(thereby entering a \u201cmental buffer zone\u201d\u2014these are\nthus called \u201cbuffer cases\u201d). Now add the counterfactual\nintervener, who wants Joe to break the law:\n\n\n\u2026 to ensure that [Joe] chooses to evade taxes, a neuroscientist\nnow implants a device which, were it to sense a moral reason occurring\nwith the specified force, would electronically stimulate his brain so\nthat he would choose to evade taxes. In actual fact, no moral reason\noccurs to him with such force, and he chooses to evade takes while the\ndevice remains idle (Pereboom 2001: 19).\n\n\nJoe seems responsible for his choice\u2014even by the\nlibertarian\u2019s lights\u2014but he could not have chosen\notherwise, for that would have required a moral reason, one that would\nhave triggered the intervention. In this FSC, the only overt sign is\nin the counterfactual sequence, but one might nevertheless worry that\nthe absence of this sign in the actual sequence is, contrary\nto the constraints of the second horn, causally sufficient for\nJoe\u2019s deciding to take the illegal deduction. So add that at any\nmoment leading up to the decision, a moral reason could occur to Joe.\nAs Jones deliberates, then, there\u2019s no point at which the\nabsence (up to that time) of a moral reason determines his deciding to\nevade taxes. (Critics of this buffer case include Ginet 2002; Goetz\n2002; Widerker 2006.)\n\nAnother way to avoid a causally sufficient sign of Jones\u2019 choice\nis simply to excise the sign itself, a feature, by the way, not always\nexplicit in Frankfurt\u2019s own FSCs. Suppose there is no sign or\nanything else causally sufficient for Jones\u2019 choice, and\nstipulate that the causal processes leading up to it are as the\nlibertarian sees fit. The question then is how to make Jones\u2019\nchoice inevitable, as a successful FSC requires. Filling in the\ndetails, Hunt (2000; 2003) imagines that the neural processes leading\nup to Jones\u2019 choice proceed without any outside interference.\nBut while these processes are indeterministic, it turns out that all\nof the alternative neural pathways\u2014those that might have\nrealized a decision to vote for the Democrat\u2014have been blocked.\nSuch \u201cblockage\u201d (Fischer 1999) gives Jones no alternative\nbut to vote for the Republican, yet he still makes the decision on his\nown\u2014the blockage never plays a role in his\ndeliberations\u2014and is thus morally responsible for it. In a\nrelated FSC (Mele & Robb 1998), Black has set up in Jones\u2019\nbrain a process that will, at the time of the decision, cause Jones to\nvote for the Republican, unless Jones decides at that time to\ndo so on his own. The process set up by Black does not interfere with\nJones\u2019 own deliberations which are assumed, as before, to\nsatisfy the libertarian. Nor does Black\u2019s process look for a\nsign of what Jones will decide. When, at the relevant time, Jones\ndecides on his own to vote for the Republican, it seems he is\nresponsible for the decision, even though the process Black has set up\nensures that Jones could not have decided otherwise. (It turns out\nthat this example too involves blockage, as the process set up by\nBlack has also \u201cneutralized\u201d the neural realization of any\nalternative decision.)\n\nAmong the reasons to worry about blockage cases is that they may,\ncontrary to what\u2019s intended, render Jones\u2019 choice causally\ndetermined, again putting his responsibility into question. After all,\nthe objection goes, there seems little if any difference between\nsaying (i) that structures and processes set up in Jones\u2019 brain\nblock off all alternatives other than choosing to vote for the\nRepublican, and (ii) that Jones\u2019 choice is causally determined\nby those same structures and processes. (For further critical\ndiscussion of such cases, see, e.g., O\u2019Connor 2000: 83\u201384;\nEkstrom 2002; Ginet 1996 [2001 addendum]; 2003; Kane 2003; Timpe 2013:\nch. 6. An important response to the dilemma defense not considered\nhere is Stump 1996; see also Goetz 1999; Stump 1999.)\n5. Beyond PAP\n\nSo far not much consensus has emerged from the literature on PAP.\nOptimists will still see progress of a sort: a principle taken for\ngranted through much of philosophy\u2019s history is now considered\nmore complex than it initially appeared, worth discussing, and\npossibly false. In any case, in this this final section, assume for a\nmoment that for some reason or other PAP should be rejected. What\nthen?\n5.1 Compatibilism Re-energized?\n\n\u00a71.1\n noted that combining PAP with some universal block of\nalternatives\u2014such as causal determinism\u2014rules out moral\nresponsibility. Here is a sketch of this kind of argument:\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt could not have done otherwise\nthan steal John\u2019s lunch.\nP2. \n If Kurt could not have done otherwise than steal John\u2019s\nlunch, then Kurt was not morally responsible for doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt was not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise is supported by the Consequence Argument (see entry\non\n arguments for incompatibilism \u00a75):\n Given determinism, Kurt\u2019s theft was a necessary consequence of\nthe distant past plus the laws of nature. Kurt has no power over\neither of these, so he couldn\u2019t avoid stealing John\u2019s\nlunch. The second premise is an instance of PAP. And the conclusion\ncan be generalized to apply to any action: if determinism is true, no\none is responsible for anything they do.\n\nCompatibilists about determinism and moral responsibility reject this\nconclusion, so they must reject at least one of the premises. One\ntraditional sort of compatibilist accepts PAP (and P2), and targets P1\nand with it the Consequence Argument. This entangles the compatibilist\nin questions about the ability to do otherwise\n (\u00a71.3\n and\n \u00a74.2.1).\n However, if PAP is false, the compatibilist can avoid these\ndifficulties and reject P2 as unsupported. Without PAP in the way,\ncompatibilism receives new energy (see entry on\n compatibilism \u00a74).\n\nBut this route to compatibilism isn\u2019t straightforward. Even\nwithout the help of PAP, determinism may still preclude responsibility\ndue to the way it blocks alternatives (Frankfurt 1969;\nBlumenfeld 1971; Fischer 1982; Speak 2007). In FSCs, what makes the\naction inevitable doesn\u2019t interfere with the agent\u2019s own\ndeliberative processes or actions: the \u201cintervention\u201d in\nthese examples is merely counterfactual. By contrast, if determinism\nis true, its intervention is actual. After all, determinism entails\nthat every detail of how we choose and act is fixed by factors in the\ndistant past. As one might put it: in a deterministic world, we act as\nwe do because determinism has put us on the single track,\nbecause we could not do otherwise. So even if FSCs show that the mere\nblocking of alternatives does not preclude moral responsibility,\ndeterminism\u2019s distinctive way of blocking alternatives is still\na threat. (In light of this point, one could reformulate the above\nincompatibilist argument explicitly in terms of the particular way\ndeterminism blocks alternatives. The modified P2 would not require\nPAP, though it would need a weaker principle.)\n\nThis move shifts the burden back to compatibilists, who need to\nexplain why determinism, in spite of the way it blocks alternatives,\ndoesn\u2019t undermine responsibility. A traditional compatibilist\nreply points out that determinism\u2014unlike compulsion and other\nthreats to responsibility\u2014does not disrupt the normal operation\nof our faculties; in that sense, its \u201cinvasiveness\u201d is\nbenign (cp.\n \u00a73.1).\n A more ambitious line defends this point by developing an\nindependently plausible compatibilist account of moral responsibility.\nHere, briefly, are two such attempts (see entry on\n compatibilism\n for a detailed treatment of these and other compatibilist\noptions).\n\nOne is from Frankfurt (1971) and others, who say the morally\nresponsible agent is one who identifies with the motives that cause\nhim to act. Consider volitional necessity\n (\u00a73.3):\n While Luther is compelled by his conscience, he identifies with these\nmoral motives. Similarly, even if the willing addict can\u2019t help\nbut take the drug, he endorses the addiction. Such cases appeared\nearlier as attempted counterexamples to PAP. Now they are treated as\ncases of benign necessitation, ways of blocking alternatives, that,\nwhile operating through an agent\u2019s own deliberative processes,\nare compatible with moral responsibility. As long as the agent\nendorses (or at least does not reject) these processes, they\nneedn\u2019t preclude responsibility. If an account along these lines\ncan be independently defended, a compatibilist can claim to have met\nthe above demand, as identification, and thus responsibility, is\ncompatible with determinism.\n\nAnother influential account is from Fischer and Ravizza (1998; see\nalso Fischer 1994). One lesson of FSCs is that the explanation of\nmoral responsibility should be found in the actual sequence leading up\nto an agent\u2019s choice and action. In the Black-Jones case, what\nhappens in the alternative sequence, in which Black intervenes, is not\nrelevant to Jones\u2019 responsibility. It\u2019s not even clear\nthat Jones does anything in the alternative sequence\n (\u00a74.2.2).\n His moral responsibility, then, must be grounded in what actually\nhappens when Jones chooses on his own to vote for the Republican.\nFischer and Ravizza argue that the relevant portion of the actual\nsequence includes a \u201creasons-responsive mechanism\u201d\nproducing Jones\u2019 choice. As Jones deliberates, his deliberative\nfaculties are sensitive to reasons to vote for the Democrat as well as\nreasons to vote for the Republican. As it turns out, the latter\noutweigh the former, but there is still a scenario in which the\nreasons to vote for the Democrat to outweigh those to vote for the\nRepublican, Jones\u2019 deliberative faculties are sensitive to this\nfact, and he votes accordingly. In this sense, his deliberative\nfaculties can respond to competing reasons. (This Democratic-friendly\nscenario needn\u2019t be accessible to Jones; we can thus preserve\nFrankfurt\u2019s constraints.) Supposing that, given the appropriate\nbackground conditions, reasons-responsiveness secures moral\nresponsibility, the compatibilist has met the earlier demand, for\nhaving a reasons-responsive mechanism looks compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s account allows that control of a sort is\nrequired for moral responsibility. One kind of control over\none\u2019s choices and actions is a matter of having alternatives: in\nthis sense, the control condition is equivalent to the rejected PAP;\nFischer and Ravizza call this \u201cregulative control\u201d. But\nthere\u2019s another kind, \u201cguidance control,\u201d that\ndoesn\u2019t require that the agent has alternatives available, and\nit\u2019s this that the reasons-responsiveness account attempts to\ncapture. Jones guides his action in the relevant sense, and for this\nreason can be responsible for what he does, even if, due to Black and\nhis computer, Jones lacks regulative control.\n5.2 Incompatibilism without PAP\n\nIn spite of compatibilist theories developed in the wake of FSCs, some\nphilosophers have remained convinced that even if PAP is false,\ndeterminism precludes responsibility. A compatibilist will challenge\nsuch philosophers to explain why this is so, if not because\ndeterminism blocks all alternatives.\n\nOne response to this challenge was in the previous section. Another\nmodifies the Consequence Argument so that it doesn\u2019t rely on\nPAP. This is the \u201cDirect Argument\u201d, direct\nbecause it doesn\u2019t go through PAP. It can be reconstructed along\nthe following lines (a formal version is in van Inwagen 1980):\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt\u2019s stealing John\u2019s\nlunch is an inevitable consequence of factors (namely, the distant\npast and laws) for which Kurt is not morally responsible.\nP2. \n If a person is not morally responsible for X, and Y\nis an inevitable consequence of X, then that person is not\nmorally responsible for Y.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt is not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise P1 follows from the definition of determinism as\nwell as some auxiliary claims about moral responsibility. P2 is the\n\u201ctransfer of blamelessness\u201d; whatever else might be said\nabout this premise, it does not require PAP. And the conclusion, which\ncan be generalized, follows from P1 and P2. But while this argument\ndoes not appeal to PAP, it appears that FSCs can be used against P2,\nthe transfer of blamelessness. The presence of Black, for which we can\nhardly blame Jones, makes the choice to vote Republican inevitable,\nbut Jones is for all that morally responsible for so-choosing (see\nFischer\u2019s introduction to his 1986; Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\nch. 6; and for more discussion, Stump 2000; McKenna 2008).\n\nA related answer to the compatibilist challenge is from the\n\u201csource incompatibilist\u201d or \u201ccausal history\nincompatibilist\u201d (Stump 1990; Klein 1990; Pereboom 1995, 2001;\nZagzebski 2000). Under determinism, you are not the source\u2014at\nleast not the ultimate source\u00ad\u2014of your actions.\nRather, the sources of your actions are found in the distant past.\nThis point seems to undermine your responsibility, at least one\ndesirable form of it (Mele 1996). Whatever the merits of source\nincompatibilism, it addresses the compatibilist challenge, for it says\nwhy determinism threatens moral responsibility\u2014namely, by ruling\nout sourcehood\u2014but without appealing to its blocking of\nalternatives, and thus without PAP. In this way, FSCs shift the\ndispute away from alternatives to the nature and importance of\nsourcehood. (Some source incompatibilists accept PAP or a closely\nrelated principle\u2014see, e.g., Kane 1996; Timpe 2013: ch.\n9\u2014but we are for now assuming PAP is false.)\n5.3 Replacement Principles\n\nOne of the results of FSCs has been a long list of principles similar\nto PAP, but intended to improve on it. Some of these keep PAP\u2019s\nfocus on action, while others switch to responsibility for\nconsequences or omissions\n (\u00a71.2).\n This final section samples a few of these replacement principles.\n5.3.1 Responsibility for Actions\n\nThis entry assumes that PAP\u2019s proposed condition is intended to\nbe explanatory, not merely necessary for responsibility. (Not all\nnecessary conditions are explanatory, as any Euthyphro-style problem\nwill show.) That is, the intent of the principle is that when a person\nlacks alternatives, it is at least in part in virtue of this\nthat she is not morally responsible (Fischer 1994: 140; Pereboom 2001:\n25). As formulated, however, PAP seems too weak for this purpose, as\nit appears to allow any alternative action to meet its requirement.\nSuppose that when Kurt stole John\u2019s lunch, he had an\nalternative, but it was so remote from his mind, so irrelevant to his\ncircumstances, that he never considered it: Kurt could have sat down\nand whistled a tune. Although this is an alternative to stealing\nJohn\u2019s lunch, it is not the sort that could potentially explain\nhis responsibility. Thus finding PAP too weak, McKenna strengthens its\nrequirements:\n\n\nPAP-significant: a person is morally responsible for\nA-ing only if she could have performed some alternative action\nB such that (i) B-ing was in her control; (ii)\nB-ing is less morally bad than A-ing; and (iii) it would\nhave been reasonable by her lights for her to consider B-ing as\nan alternative to A-ing. (simplified from McKenna 2003:\n209)\n\n\nCondition (i) brings to mind the earlier discussion of robustness\n (\u00a74.2.2),\n but (iii) is the focus at the moment, as it shows why Kurt\u2019s\nsit-and-whistle alternative is not enough to ground his\nresponsibility: it was not reasonable for him to consider this as an\noption. McKenna rejects PAP as \u201ctoo inclusive\u201d, favoring\ninstead a principle with these more significant constraints. Having\nsaid that, he argues that even this improved principle falls to an\nFSC, one that, however, leaves open plenty of insignificant\nalternatives to assuage libertarian concerns (see Robinson 2014 for\ncritical discussion).\n\nOne apparent lesson from PAP-significant is that, contrary to the\nsimplifying assumption adopted at the outset of this entry, one cannot\ncleanly separate PAP\u2019s condition on moral responsibility from\nepistemic requirements (cp. Mele 2010). In particular, in order for\nalternatives to count as explanatory in the relevant sense, they must\nbe reasonable from the point of view of the agent. Similar\nentanglements arise when one considers PAP\u2019s historical clause\n (\u00a73.3;\n see, e.g., Ginet 1996; Ekstrom 2000: 211). Luther is responsible for\nhis defiant act even if he could not have at the time done otherwise.\nHis responsibility can be \u201ctraced\u201d to past self-forming\nchoices in which he could have done otherwise. If these are to help\nexplain his responsibility when brought before Charles V, it seems as\nif Luther must in the past have known, at least in broad outline, how\nthose choices would shape his future actions. But if there are such\nepistemic conditions in PAP\u2019s historical rider, there may be\nproblems looming, ordinary cases (not FSCs) in which a person is\nresponsible for her action at t, cannot at t do\notherwise, and yet whose responsibility cannot be traced to choices in\nthe past with the appropriate epistemic credentials. (See Vargas 2005,\nand for discussion, Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Shabo 2015.)\n\nThere are other action-focused replacements for PAP worth considering.\nBut because action has been in play for most of this entry, the\nconcluding sub-sections look at responsibility for something other\nthan action: consequences and omissions.\n5.3.2 Responsibility for Consequences\n\nIt seems clear that sometimes we are responsible for the consequences\nof our actions (for dissent, see Frankfurt 1983). Recall that Meghan\nis responsible, not just for ruining Sean\u2019s tea by putting salt\nin it (an action), but for Sean\u2019s tea being ruined (a\nconsequence). Call this consequence a \u201cstate of affairs\u201d.\nPerhaps one can also be responsible for states of affairs that\naren\u2019t the consequences of action. A homeowner is responsible\nfor the dangerous sink hole developing in her back yard, not because\nof anything she did, but due simply to negligence. However one is to\ntreat such cases, they are here set aside to focus on states of\naffairs that are more clearly the consequences of actions. And not\nsurprisingly, there is a replacement for PAP explicitly about these\n(this principle and much of what follows is adapted from van Inwagen\n1978; cp. Ginet 1996: 403):\n\n\nPAP-consequences: a person is morally responsible for\na consequence of what she has done only if she could have prevented\nit.\n\n\nThis has as much initial appeal as PAP. If the result of what Meghan\ndid would have happened anyway\u2014if it was, for her,\ninevitable\u2014then it\u2019s hard to see how she could be praised\nor blamed for it. Indeed, the examples that support PAP\n (\u00a72.2)\n could also be adapted to support this new principle. If it\u2019s\ninappropriate to praise a person\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d\ndonation to a charity when it\u2019s caused by a compulsion to give\nthings away, it is also inappropriate to praise that person for the\nconsequence of this act, namely the charity\u2019s windfall. And the\nreason is that the donor could not have prevented this state of\naffairs from obtaining.\n\nMore relevant to present concerns, however, is that this replacement\nmay not be vulnerable to the examples that plague PAP. Return to our\ncentral FSC: It seems as if Jones is responsible for voting Republican\n(an action) because he does so on his own, for his own reasons. But\nnow consider a resulting state of affairs, say, the Republican\u2019s\nhaving one more vote. This would have obtained no matter what Jones\ndid, or failed to do, on his own. Due to Black, the obtaining of the\nstate of affairs is not (as Jones\u2019 action is) sensitive to how\nthings proceed with Jones\u2019 own deliberative processes. One thus\nloses any sense in which Jones is the author of the consequence, and\nwith it any sense in which he is responsible. This creates some space\nbetween PAP-Consequences and PAP, permitting the former to stand when\nthe latter falls.\n\nHere a state of affairs is a universal: whether Jones votes for a\nRepublican on his own or because of Black\u2019s intervention, one\nand the same consequence obtains. In this way, the object of moral\nappraisal (the state of affairs) doesn\u2019t turn on how things\nactually go for Jones. But matters look different if the consequence\nis instead construed as a concrete particular, something produced by\nJones in the actual scenario. In that case, PAP-consequences looks\nvulnerable to FSCs in just the same way PAP is. When Jones votes for\nthe Republican, the particular consequence\u2014that event\nof one vote\u2019s being cast for a Republican\u2014seems to be\nsomething Jones produced on his own, and is thus responsible for.\n(Whether numerically the same event would have obtained in the\ncounterfactual scenario is a controversial issue, one whose resolution\ncould yield a version of the \u201cflicker\u201d strategy considered\nin\n \u00a74.2.2.)\n Let us in any case continue to assume that a consequence is a\n(universal) state of affairs.\n\nEven under this assumption, might this replacement fall to FSCs? The\nabove defense suggests not, but this has not prevented philosophers\nfrom trying, and with a variety of examples (e.g., Heinaman 1986; Rowe\n1989; Klein 1990: ch. 2; Fischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 4). Here is\none thought to motivate such a project: Even if a consequence of an\nagent\u2019s action was inevitable, we can still make sense of her\ncausing that state of affairs to obtain, which thus looks like the\nresult of something she did, even if it would have obtained anyway.\nPerhaps this is enough to make the state of affairs sensitive to the\nactual sequence by which it was produced, grounding the agent\u2019s\nmoral responsibility, as an FSC requires. Rowe (1989), for example,\nimagines you are on a train headed down Track 2, a track that leads to\na safe stopping point. If you throw a switch, the train will go onto\nanother track, Track 1, on which a dog is tied. Unbeknownst to you,\nthere is someone (Peter) who is poised to throw that switch if you\ndon\u2019t. As it turns out, you throw the switch on your\nown\u2014Peter doesn\u2019t act at all\u2014and the train goes down\nTrack 1, killing the dog. Rowe says you caused the dog\u2019s death\nand are in fact morally responsible for it. (As usual, assume other\nstandard requirements are met.) Yet that consequence, the dog\u2019s\ndeath, was inevitable: there was nothing you could have done to\nprevent it. (For a successor to PAP-consequences, one that may handle\npotential counterexamples more easily, see Sartorio 2012.)\n5.3.3 Responsibility for Omissions\n\nSometimes a person is responsible for not acting: Blame Luke\nthe indifferent lifeguard for failing to save the drowning swimmer.\nCredit Emily for not cheating on a test. Let us formulate one more\nreplacement for PAP, using \u201comission,\u201d broadly, for any\nfailure to act:\n\n\nPAP-omissions: a person is morally responsible for\nwhat she didn\u2019t do only if she could have done it.\n\n\nAccording to this new principle, if the waters were too treacherous\nfor a rescue, Luke is blameless for his failure. (He may still be\nresponsible for failing to try, or for failing to call for help.)\nSimilarly, Emily is responsible for not cheating only if she could\nhave done so. If, due to a fear of being caught, she was unable to\ncheat, or if the means to cheat were simply unavailable to her, she\ncould not be credited for her omission, at least not on that occasion.\nPAP-omissions is here treated as its own stand-alone principle, though\nthere is some metaphysics behind such an assumption (Clarke 2012; S.\nBernstein 2015). The present question is whether it can survive the\ndemise of PAP.\n\nIt appears not, for this replacement looks vulnerable to many of the\nsame arguments\n (\u00a73).\n But to test this alleged symmetry, focus in particular on whether an\nFSC can be constructed as a counterexample to PAP-omissions (van\nInwagen 1978, 204\u20135): Bob sees a man being robbed and beaten\noutside of his house. After considering whether to call the police,\nBob decides not to get involved, calculating that it wouldn\u2019t be\nworth the trouble. For his own reasons, then, Bob refrains from\ncalling the police. What Bob didn\u2019t know, however, is that the\ndue to a technology disaster, all of the phones in the city are out of\norder and will be for hours. It seems then that Bob isn\u2019t\nresponsible for failing to call the police. And plausibly,\nPAP-omissions explains why he\u2019s off the hook: due to the\ntelephone disaster, he could not have called the police. (He might\nstill be responsible for failing to try to call the police, but trying\nis something he could have done.) Given the present assumption that\nPAP is false, what emerges from such examples is, contrary to initial\nappearances, an important asymmetry: \n\n\nmoral responsibility for an action does not require the freedom to\nrefrain from performing the action, whereas moral responsibility for\nfailure to perform an action requires the freedom to perform the\naction. (Fischer & Ravizza 1991: 262, with similar examples; they\nlater retract the asymmetry claim)\n\n\nHere\u2019s one try at explaining this asymmetry (Fischer\n1985\u201386: 267\u2013268): moral responsibility for\nanything\u2014action, consequence, omission\u2014requires a certain\nkind of control, though what kind of control is needed may vary\ndepending on the case. Now grant that FSCs show, contra PAP, that\nregulative control\n (\u00a75.1)\n isn\u2019t required for responsibility for actions: guidance control\nis enough (assuming other conditions on moral responsibility are met).\nWhen omissions are in play, however, there is no potential object of\nguidance control, for there is nothing to guide. For omissions, the\nonly kind of control available to satisfy the control requirement is\nregulative control. No wonder then that FSCs fail to refute\nPAP-omissions, as these cases remove the only sort of control one\ncould have over an omission.\n\nThat said, not everyone grants the claimed asymmetry. Both PAP and\nPAP-omissions should fall together (Frankfurt 1994; Glannon 1995;\nFischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 5; or stand together: Swenson 2016).\nConsider one final FSC, this time bringing the omission inside to the\n\u201clocus of responsibility\u201d: a choice (or in this case, the\nlack of one). Luke the indifferent lifeguard fails to save the\nswimmer, and indeed fails even to try, for reasons entirely his own:\nhe\u2019s lazy and indifferent. But now add that unbeknownst to Luke,\nhad he even considered saving the swimmer, he would have been\nparalyzed by an overwhelming fear, compelling him to remain inactive,\nnot even choosing or trying to save the swimmer. Here there is no\noverdetermination, for the fear and the underlying pathology remain\ndormant in the actual scenario: the only causal factors relevant to\nthe omission are Luke\u2019s own cognitive states and values, which\nappear to exert a kind of responsibility-relevant control over his\nfailure. This looks like a genuine FSC, and, if so, a counterexample\nto PAP-omissions. (For more on the considerable complexities involved\nwith PAP-omissions, see McIntyre 1994; Sartorio 2005; Clarke 2014;\nFischer 2017.)\n",
