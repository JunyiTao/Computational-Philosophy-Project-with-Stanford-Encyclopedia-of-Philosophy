    "main_text": "Main Philosophical Works || On Critique\u2019s Attempt to Reduce Reason to the Understanding (1802)\n3.6 On Critique\u2019s Attempt to Reduce Reason to the Understanding (1802)\n\nThe German title of the \u2018On Critique\u2018s Attempt\u2019\nreads as \u2018Ueber das Unternehmen des Kriticismus, die Vernunft zu\nVerstande zu bringen, und der Philosophie \u00fcberhaupt eine neue\nAbsicht zu geben\u2019. Motivated by the challenge to provide\nphilosophy a new objective, Jacobi asserts that Kant does not push\nopen the limits of transcendental philosophy to launch the quest for a\nself\u2013sufficient speculative thinking; rather, he holds that an\nindependent object should continue to be a necessity for\nepistemology.\n\nHowever, Jacobi remarks that the same independence of the object\ncannot find a proper place in Kant\u2019s system of reason, as it\ncannot really connect with the subject. In a sense, summarizes Jacobi,\nthe subject and the object are in mystical connection (mystische\nVerbindung) (JWA 2, 1: 269) This is made more explicit here than\nin the previous publications, although the idea had already been\nclarified; see, for instance the Supplement 7 of the second edition of\nthe \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019 or the Supplement 2 of the\n\u2018Jacobi an Fichte\u2019, published in the Collected Works\n(1812\u20131825) as an independent essay with the title \u2018On the\nInseparability of the Concept of Freedom and Providence from the\nConcept of Reason\u2019. Jacobi indicates that problems arise where\nreason is deprived of the proper power that it must be accountable\nfor. On one side, reason (Vernunft) seeks the unconditioned,\nwhile on the other, the understanding (Verstand) limits the\nrange of knowledge to the conditioned. This produces a conflict. This\nconflict between reason and understanding appears to be resolved by\nKant, so Jacobi contends, as the understanding positively limits\nreason, and reason negatively limits the understanding (JWA 2, 1:\n272). Nevertheless, the calamitous outcome is clear: true\nauthority (Jacobi, 1994(2): 542 and JWA 2, 1: 380) is given\nto the understanding, which uses the ideas of reason for its own\npurposes and never gives jurisdiction over the definition of objective\nreality to reason.\n\nAnd yet, Kant\u2019s transcendental philosophy is neither decidedly\nrejected nor unequivocally accepted. On the one hand, Jacobi\nacknowledges that, beyond the conflict between reason and\nunderstanding, Kant\u2019s system allows sense\u2013perception\n(Sinnlichkeit) to exercise power over understanding, de\nfacto limiting understanding to merely being the faculty that\nelaborates upon content that it does not own or provide (JWA 2, 1:\n272\u2013273). On the other hand, Jacobi observes that the\nimagination (Einbildungskraft) plays a crucial\nepistemological role, mediating between the a priori and\na posteriori of sense\u2013perception. As a result of this\ninvestigation of the \u2018Critique of Pure Reason\u2019, which is\nthe most analytical of his publications (JWA 2, 1: 278ff), Jacobi\ndemonstrates how the imagination discloses what Kant\u2019s idealism\ncould lead to.\n",
