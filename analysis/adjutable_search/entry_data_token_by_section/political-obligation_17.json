    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation || Natural Duty\n4.4 Natural Duty\n\nThe final contenders in the political obligation debates are natural\nduty accounts. In this context, natural duties are understood to be\nones people have simply in virtue of their status as moral agents;\nthey need do nothing to acquire them, nor does their bearing such\nduties depend on their occupying some role in a socially salient\nrelationship. Natural duties are also universal in scope; they are\nowed to all members of a class defined in terms of possession of some\nfeature, such as sentience or rationality. John Rawls first broached\nsuch an argument for political obligation when he asserted in A\nTheory of Justice that everyone is subject to a natural duty of\njustice that \u201crequires us to support and to comply with just\ninstitutions that exist and apply to us\u201d (1999, p. 99). More\nrecently, political philosophers and theorists including Jeremy\nWaldron (1999), Thomas Christiano (2008), Christopher Heath Wellman\n(2005), Anna Stilz (2009) and, arguably, David Estlund (2008; see\nsection 4.1 above) have refined and expanded upon Rawls\u2019s\nsomewhat vague contention, some of them in ways reminiscent of or even\nexplicitly modeled on Kant\u2019s defense of political obligation\n(see section 1.5 above).\n\nContemporary natural duty theorists differ over the natural duty that\nprovides the basis for political obligation. Christiano grounds his\naccount in a fundamental principle of justice requiring the equal\nadvancement of people\u2019s interests, Wellman in a Samaritan duty\nof easy rescue, and Stilz in a Kantian duty of respect for\nothers\u2019 freedom-as-independence, understood as a secure sphere\nof self-determination defined by a person\u2019s rights. These\ntheorists agree, however, that moral agents can discharge their\nnatural duty to others only through submission to the authority of a\ncommon legal order. This is so for several reasons: the demands of\njustice are sometimes underdetermined; its achievement requires the\nresolution of coordination problems; and most importantly, people\nreasonably disagree over the demands of justice. Christiano traces\nthis disagreement to what he calls the facts of judgment: diversity in\npeople\u2019s natural talents and cultural surroundings, cognitive\nbiases in their interpretation of people\u2019s interests and the\nvalue assigned to their own interests relative to the value assigned\nto the interests of others, and fallibility in both moral and\nnon-moral judgment. In light of these facts, even those who make a\ngood faith effort to discern what justice requires of them in their\ninteraction with others will fail to reach a consensus. Agents who act\non their own, private, judgment of justice will be perceived by others\nto be acting unjustly. If some are able to unilaterally impose their\nconception of justice on others, the latter will not enjoy\nfreedom-as-independence (Stilz 2009), or will suffer the violation of\ntheir fundamental interests in being at home in the world, in\ncorrecting for others\u2019 cognitive biases, and in being treated by\none\u2019s fellows as a person with equal moral standing (Christiano\n2008). Only submission to a common legal order can provide a solution\nto this problem of domination and conflict, argue natural duty\nproponents of political obligation. \u201cThere is no way other than\ngeneral compliance with a single authoritative set of rules to secure\npeace and protect basic moral rights\u201d (Wellman 2005, p. 45); law\n\u201csettle[s] for practical purposes what justice consists in by\npromulgating public rules for the guidance of individual\nbehavior\u201d (Christiano, p. 53); or in Stilz\u2019s Kantian\nterms, law replaces the unilateral imposition of obligations on others\nwith the omnilateral imposition of obligations on all.\n\nNot just any legal order will do, though. Rather, many natural duty\ntheorists of political obligation argue either that the law must be\ncrafted according to democratic procedures or that it must not violate\ncertain individual rights, or both, if those it addresses are to have\na duty to obey it. Christiano, for instance, argues that against a\nbackground constituted by diversity, cognitive bias, and fallibility,\nagents can be sure that their fundamental interest in judgment will\nnot be unjustifiably set back only if political power is exercised\nwithin institutions that publicly realize equality, i.e. democratic\nones. Likewise, Waldron defends the authority of a majority-rule\ndecision procedure on the basis of its \u201ccommitment to equality\n\u2013 a determination that when we, who need to settle on a single\ncourse of action, disagree about what to do, there is no reasonable\nbasis for us in designing our decision-procedures to accord greater\nweight to one side than to the other in the disagreement\u201d\n(Waldron 1999, p. 117; see also Lefkowitz 2004). Even if a person does\nnot believe that the particular scheme of distributive justice\nrealized in the law treats her justly, she can recognize that the\nprocess whereby that scheme was created, and can be modified or\neliminated, does treat her as an equal. Daniel Viehoff also appeals to\nthe egalitarian character of democratic procedures to justify a moral\nduty to obey the law, arguing that they best realize an ideal of\nrelational equality in which agents forbear from using any power\nadvantages they may enjoy to determine the terms of their morally\nnecessary coordination (Viehoff 2014; see also Kolodny 2014; Viehoff\n2019). Finally, Stilz argues that law omnilaterally imposes\nobligations on all only if it expresses a general will. It does the\nlatter if and only if it \u201cfirst, defines rights (protected\ninterests) that apply equally to all; second, it defines these rights\nvia a procedure that considers everyone\u2019s interests equally; and\nthird, everyone who is coerced to obey the law has a voice in the\nprocedure\u201d (Stilz 2009, p. 78). The latter two conditions, she\nmaintains, can only be met by a democratic procedure. Unsurprisingly,\nsome theorists remain unconvinced by the forgoing arguments for\ndemocracy\u2019s essential contribution to the justification of\npolitical obligation (see, e.g., Huemer 2013; Frye and Klosko\n2017).\n\nWhatever its details, many natural duty theorists also argue that the\nconception of the person that grounds their accounts of political\nobligation also limits the scope of legitimate law. Reasonable\ndisagreement over freedom-as-independence does not extend to torture,\nfor example, and at some perhaps indeterminate point the denial of\nfreedom of conscience clearly conflicts with a person\u2019s\nfundamental interests in correcting for cognitive bias and being at\nhome in the world. Most natural duty theorists conclude that subjects\nof a legal order that recognizes no rights on the part of some or all\nof its subjects against such treatment lacks legitimate authority,\neven if it is democratic.\n\nRecall that natural duty accounts of political obligation begin with\nduties that all moral agents owe to all other moral persons as such.\nSimmons argues that this commitment renders natural duty accounts\nunable to justify the particularity of political obligations; that is,\nthe fact that people have political obligations in virtue of their\ncitizenship or residence in particular states, and that they owe those\nobligations to that particular state (or to their fellow citizens)\n(1979, pp. 31\u20135; 2005, pp. 166\u201379). Even if we have a\nnatural duty \u201cto support and comply with just\ninstitutions,\u201d as Rawls maintains, why must we discharge that\nduty by supporting and complying with the just institutions that\ncomprise the state in which we are citizens or residents? True, those\nare the institutions that \u201capply to us,\u201d in the sense that\nthey claim jurisdiction over us. But why think this social fact\nhas any moral import, particularly if we think the political\ninstitutions of other states more worthy of our support because they\nbetter promote justice, or are in greater need of support?\n\nSome natural duty theorists point to the intensity and frequency of\ninteraction among those who live in close proximity to one another as\na justification for the duty to obey the laws of the particular\njurisdiction in which one resides (Waldron 1993; 1996). Others\nemphasize that a person who free-rides on his fellow citizens\u2019\nsupport for and compliance with the law to act on his own judgment of\nhow he can best discharge his natural duty of justice unfairly takes\nadvantage of them. Absent their good-faith sacrifice of the liberty to\nact on their private judgments regarding what justice requires, the\nfree-rider would likely be unable to act as he does (Wellman 2005, pp.\n44\u20135). Finally, some natural duty theorists argue that Simmons\nmisconstrues the natural duty of justice. Justice is not an outcome or\nstate of affairs that agents have a duty to promote via whatever means\nthey judge to be most effective or efficient, be it the political\ninstitutions of their state or those of another. Rather, justice\ncharacterizes a particular manner of interacting with others, such as\nwith respect for their freedom-as-independence or their fundamental\ninterests, including but not limited to their interests in judgment.\nAt least for a citizen of a liberal democratic state, the latter\nconstrual of justice entails that she can only treat her fellow\ncitizens justly if she guides her conduct according to its law (Stilz\n2012).\n\nSimmons has recently offered a rebuttal to this second line of\nargument (Simmons 2013). It entails, he argues, that citizens of one\nliberal-democratic state who are forcibly subjected to the rule of\nanother liberal-democratic state immediately acquire political\nobligations to the second state as long as they are accorded full\ncitizenship rights. Simmons treats this implication as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of the democratic Kantian justification for political\nobligation, a demonstration that it cannot properly account for the\nparticularity of such obligations. In part, this latest rejoinder by\nSimmons evidences and gives further impetus to a shift in the debate\nover political obligation from the question of what gives states a\nright to rule particular people, to which correlates their duty to\nobey the law, to the question of what gives states a right to rule\nover a particular territory [see the entry on territorial rights and\nterritorial justice]. But it also points to the need for natural duty\ntheorists to elaborate upon their so far brief discussions of the\ncontribution that a legitimate international legal order makes to the\nlegitimacy of domestic legal orders.\n",
