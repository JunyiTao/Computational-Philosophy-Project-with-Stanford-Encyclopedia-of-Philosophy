    "main_text": "\n\nIn our ordinary discourse, we distinguish between physical systems\nthat perform computations, such as computers and calculators, and\nphysical systems that don\u2019t, such as rocks and raindrops. Among\ncomputing devices, we distinguish between more and less powerful ones.\nThese distinctions are of both practical and theoretical importance: a\nsupercomputer can compute in minutes what would take decades on a\nlaptop, while a calculator cannot do certain things that a laptop can\ndo, even in principle. What grounds these distinctions? What is the\nprincipled difference, if there is one, between a rock and a\ncalculator, or between a calculator and a computer? Answering these\nquestions is more difficult than it may seem.\n\nIn addition to our ordinary discourse, computation is central to many\nsciences. Computer scientists design, build, and program computers.\nBut again, what counts as a computer? If a salesperson sold you an\nordinary rock as a computer, you should probably get your money back.\nAgain, what does the rock lack that a genuine computer has?\n\nHow powerful a computer can you build? Can you build a machine that\ncomputes anything you wish? Although it is often said that modern\ncomputers can compute anything (i.e., any function of natural numbers,\nor equivalently, any function of strings of letters from a finite\nalphabet), this is incorrect. Ordinary computers can compute only a\ntiny subset of these functions. Is it physically possible to do\nbetter? Which functions are physically computable? These questions are\nbound up with the foundations of physics.\n\nComputation is also central to psychology and neuroscience, and\nperhaps other areas of biology. According to the computational theory\nof cognition, cognition is a kind of computation: the behavior of\ncognitive systems is causally explained by the computations they\nperform. In order to test a computational theory of something, we need\nto know what counts as a computation in a physical system. Once again,\nthe nature of computation lies at the foundation of empirical\nscience.\n",
