Plato\u2019s Socrates: the \u201cbest philosopher\u201d\n\nOf all philosophers More gave pride of place to \u201cPlato\nalone\u201d (1520 letter to Brixius [EW 468.38, CW\n3.2: 643]), describing him as \u201cthe great philosopher\u201d and\n\u201cwise\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 681.12, 29, CW 6: 334.23, 335.2]). Plato\u2019s\nSocrates, whom More called \u201cthe best philosopher\u201d, defined\nphilosophy as (in More\u2019s paraphrasing) \u201cthe meditation or\nexercise of [i.e., the preparation for] death\u201d since \u201cthe\nstudy of philosophy labor[s] to sever the soul from the love and\naffections of the body while they be together\u201d (1522 Four\nLast Things [EW 482.41\u201352]). As More expressed it\nin one of his early works, Socrates achieved \u201cmerry\ncheer\u201d, \u201cwisdom\u201d, and \u201cliberty\u201d by\nescaping the \u201cbondage\u201d of Fortune and by understanding the\n\u201csecret draughts [i.e., designs] of nature\u201d (c. 1504\n\u201cFortune Verses\u201d [EW 14\u201315]).\n\nMore\u2019s Socrates was primarily concerned with ethics. In\npresenting Socrates\u2019 definition of philosophy as a preparation\nfor death, More was alluding to Plato\u2019s Phaedo, in\nwhich Socrates argues that the true philosopher must be freed from\nbodily appetites and pleasures that hinder the soul from reaching\ntruth, virtue, and wisdom (963e\u201367e). In the Phaedo,\nSocrates also provocatively calls the body a prison of the soul (82e)\nand says he is looking forward to the liberty that death will provide\nhis soul (1522, Four Last Things [EW\n482.42\u201343]). Throughout his writings, More also frequently drew\nattention to the distortions in perception caused by the senses and\nthe undisciplined passions, but his incarnational view consistently\ncaused him to acknowledge that the body and soul are \u201cso knit\nand joined together\u201d as to \u201cmake between them one\nperson\u201d, able to act harmoniously with proper education,\ndiligent training, and recourse to grace (1534 Dialogue of\nComfort [EW 1176.59\u201360]; also c. 1510 Life of\nPico [EW 85.30, 61\u201362; 90.15\u201393.210;\n94.82]).\n\nMore, following Augustine (Augustine, The Trinity, Books\n9\u201310), saw the soul as created in the image of God by reason, at\nleast in part, of being endowed \u201cwith the three great gifts,\nmemory, understanding, and will, in a certain manner of resemblance of\nthe \u2026 Trinity\u201d (c. 1510 Life of Pico\n[EW 74.62\u201365, 89.61\u201362]; 1534 Treatise on the\nPassion [EW 1031.32\u201335]). He saw as well that\n\u201cbrutish appetites\u201d can \u201cmake the soul leave the\nnoble use of his reason\u201d\u2014thus \u201cturn[ing] the image\nof God into a beast\u201d (EW 74). One of More\u2019s most\nfrequent themes, from his first published work to his last, was the\ncharacter of that \u201cspiritual battle\u201d needed to allow\n\u201creason to rule as a king\u201d\u2014and therefore\nfacilitating liberty through law, i.e., through law as reason embodied\nover time for the good of all.\n\nMore addressed the question of how one frees the soul \u201cfor truth\nand right reason in all things\u201d (1506 Lucian Dialogues\n[EW 44.17]) in a series of rhyme royal poems (i.e., in\nseven-line iambic pentameter stanzas rhyming ababbcc) about the\nspiritual life in his most extensive addition to the first of his\npublications in English, The Life of John Pico, Earl of\nMirandola. There More developed \u201cTwelve Rules\u201d and\n\u201cTwelve Weapons\u201d of \u201cSpiritual Battle\u201d needed\nto achieve joy through virtue and conscience, since \u201cOf virtue\nmore joy the conscience hath within / Than outward the body of all his\nfilthy sin\u201d (EW 87.139\u201340) and so \u201cThou\nshalt no pleasure comparable find / To th\u2019inward gladness of a\nvirtuous mind\u201d (EW 89.74\u201375.) To distinguish this\napproach from that of the Stoics, he also developed in rhyme royal\nverse what he called \u201cThe Twelve Properties \u2026 of a\nLover\u201d. This love ballad makes clear that a \u201cperfect\nlover\u201d will gladly \u201csuffer trouble, pain, and woe\u201d\nfor his human beloved, and all the more so for God (EW\n90\u201393).\n\nThis early set of poems on the \u201cspiritual battle\u201d was\nfollowed by prose writings such as The Four Last Things and\nportions of his Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight. These\nwritings concerned the \u201cspiritual exercise by which the soul\nwillingly worketh with the body\u201d to cultivate \u201cinward\nspiritual pleasure\u201d based on neither \u201cfalse\nimagination\u201d nor \u201cvain pleasures of the flesh\u201d but\non a very true contemplation\u201d and \u201cthe very pleasures of\nthe soul\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 480, 488]). Regarding this \u201cspiritual\nbusiness\u201d of cultivating the soul \u201cto rule and bridle\nsensuality\u201d and to be \u201csubject and obedient to\nreason\u201d (EW 584.67\u201371), More alludes regularly to\nthe Phaedrus, where Socrates says that the reasoning\ncharioteer must bridle and govern his passionate horses (EW\n15.271, 26.15\u201336, 577.1\u20132, 580.83, 581.54,\n584.69\u201371, 1101.56, 1232.71\u201372, 1350.46\u201347). More\nalso urges his readers to cultivate the \u201cgarden of our\nsoul\u201d by engendering, planting, and watering in it the\n\u201cspiritual affections\u201d that God \u201cby sundry means\ninstructeth our reason to lean unto\u201d (1534 Dialogue of\nComfort [EW 1232.52\u201366]; also 1522 Four Last\nThings [EW 477.49\u201350]; 1529 Dialogue of Sir\nThomas More, Knight [EW 584.34\u201335]).\n",
