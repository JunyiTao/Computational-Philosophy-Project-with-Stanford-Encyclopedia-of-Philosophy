    "main_text": "Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls? || \u201cThe Souls of White Folks\u201d in Darkwater (1920)\n4.1 \u201cThe Souls of White Folks\u201d in Darkwater (1920)\n\nWhile Du Bois does not present the \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d\nconcept in so many words in Darkwater, published in 1920, the\nsecond chapter of that text, \u201cThe Souls of White Folks\u201d,\nseems to invoke it. There, Du Bois characterizes the development of\nwhat he calls \u201cthe religion of whiteness\u201d and discusses\nits impact on social relations in the nineteenth and the early\ntwentieth centuries. Du Bois makes a claim for a special kind of\nknowledge of the psychology of white people. He writes of himself\nthat, about them, \u201cI am singularly clairvoyant\u201d. After\nspecifying that his knowledge is not that of the foreigner, nor of the\nservant or the worker, he writes:\n\nI see these souls undressed and from the back and sides. I see the\nworking of their entrails. I know their thoughts and they know that I\nknow. (Du Bois 1920: 17)\n\n\nDu Bois here claims an insight into the psyches of whites that depends\nin part on an awareness of their beliefs and attitudes concerning\nrace, of their falseness. This insight is of the kind that\ndouble-consciousness makes possible. But what Du Bois claims here also\nseems to go beyond the 1903 conception, since that conception did not\nspecifically and explicitly refer to knowledge of the souls\nof white folks. Several pages into the \u201cSouls of White\nFolks\u201d chapter, after identifying the \u201cdiscovery of\npersonal whiteness\u201d as an historically recent phenomenon\nassociated with \u201cthis new religion of whiteness\u201d, Du Bois\nindicates that it is black folk generally \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d\n\u2013 who have such powers of \u201cclairvoyance\u201d:\n\nWe whose shame, humiliation and deep insult [the white man\u2019s]\naggrandizement so often involved were never deceived. We looked at him\nclearly, with world-old eyes, and saw simply a human being, weak and\npitiable and cruel, even as we are and were. (1920: 20)\n\n\nHere is a condition of consciousness that allows \u201cthe\nhumiliated\u201d to see more clearly the reality of the lives of\nthose who humiliate than the humiliators themselves do. While such\nknowledge does not involve \u201cknow[ing] the thoughts\u201d of the\nhumiliators in detail, it does require that one know some\npatterns of what and how they think and feel. Du Bois is here\nconsidering the ideology of white supremacy, tracing out the\nhistorical conditions of its development and some of the psychological\nconsequences it has for whites who accept it and live in and on the\nbasis of it. To the extent that whites accept the premises of white\nsupremacy, and live and act upon them, they are deceived about\nthemselves and act out a deception that the blacks who are\nsubject to the consequences of those premises are in a position to see\nthrough. This is not the core of double-consciousness, though it seems\nto be the sort of thing Du Bois had in mind when he referred in 1903\nto \u201csecond sight\u201d, a key adjunct to double-consciousness,\nin the \u201cStrivings\u201d passage. This matches the reading found\nin Henry, Gordon, and Kirkland as well.\n\nBut there is a bit more here, and other than, \u201csecond\nsight\u201d. For what Du Bois presents in this chapter is a critical\nanalysis of the American ideology of white supremacy that is informed\nby sociological analysis and backed up by historical and\nsocial-scientific understanding. Du Bois both begins and ends the\nchapter by noting his own position \u201chigh in the tower\u201d.\nThis presumably refers both to his distanced, observer status, and,\nrelatedly, to his own achieved position as an academically trained\nsocial scientist \u2013 indeed, one of the most highly trained minds\nin America at the time \u2013 bringing his powers of analysis to bear\non the \u201csouls of white folk\u201d. Du Bois gives a\nscientifically-informed, nuanced historical analysis built on a\n\u201cclairvoyant\u201d insight into the psyche of the white person\n\u201cunder the influence\u201d of white supremacist ideology, one\npredicated on both the second sight and a kind of\nideology-critique.\n",
