    "main_text": "The Issue of Weak Order || Completeness\n4.2 Completeness\n\nAlthough the issue comes last in this catalogue of empirical\nchallenges to SEU, early doubts regarding the empirical adequacy of\nthe completeness assumption were aired by the very architects of the\nframework, including von Neumann & Morgenstern (1947: 630) and\nSavage (1954: 21). For instance, von Neumann & Morgenstern write:\n\n\n\nIt is very dubious, whether the idealization of reality which treats\nthis postulate as a valid one, is appropriate or even convenient. \n\n\nFailure of completeness has been claimed to stem both from either (i)\nincompleteness in judgments of comparative probability or (ii)\nincompleteness in preferences between outcomes. Both sources of\nincompleteness can be handled in \u201cmulti-prior expected multi\nutility\u201d models, which offer what one might call a\n\u201csupervaluationist\u201d representation of preferences over\nacts, as follows:  \n\n\\[ f\\succeq g \\text{ iff, for all } \\langle P, u\\rangle\\in \\Phi,\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n P(E_i^f)u(x_i)\\geq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\nP(E_i^g)u(x_i)\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is a set of pairs of probability and utility functions.\nDue to space considerations, axiomatic details are left out here. The\ninterested reader is referred to the recent general treatment given by\nGalaabaatar & Karni (2013), who relate their results to important\nearlier work by the likes of Bewley (1986), Seidenfeld et al.\n(1995), Ok et al. (2012), and Nau (2006), among others.\n",
