    "main_text": "The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Mass and Energy in Relativity: Preliminaries and Notation\n1.2 Mass and Energy in Relativity: Preliminaries and Notation\n\nAs Hecht has emphasized, Einstein never wrote down his famous result\nusing the symbols \u201c\\(E\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(m\\)\u201d as they\nappear in the famous equation attributed to him (Hecht 2012). Although\npart of the reason is merely that Einstein used different letters for\nenergy, mass, and the speed of light in his early papers discussing\nmass-energy equivalence (in 1905 and 1906), deeper reasons related to\nhow we should understand the result quickly emerged. \n\nIn his review article on special relativity from 1907, Einstein shows\nthat a body of mass \\(\\mu\\) that has absorbed an amount of energy\n\\(E_o\\) as measured in its rest frame executes motion, in an inertial\nframe relative to which it moves with some velocity, as if its mass\n\\(M\\) was given by the expression (Einstein 1907b, p. 286): \n\n\\[\nM = \\mu + E_o /c^2\n\\]\n\n\nIn a footnote, Einstein explains the convention, which he had already\nadopted in an earlier paper (Einstein 1907a, p. 250), of using\n\u201cthe subscript \u2018\\(o\\)\u2019 to indicate that the quantity in\nquestion refers to a reference system that is at rest relative to the\nphysical system considered\u201d (Einstein 1907b, p. 286). \n\nAfter 1907, Einstein\u2019s notation crystalizes so that by 1921, in\nhis Princeton Lectures, Einstein expresses his famous result by\nwriting (Einstein 1922, p. 46): \n\n\\[\\tag{Einstein's Equation}\nE_o = mc^2\n\\]\n\n\nOur main task in the next section is to explain the physical\nsignificance of the equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\), which we will henceforth\ncall \u201cEinstein\u2019s equation\u201d, and its relationship to\nits iconic variant without the subscript \u201c\\(o\\)\u201d appearing\nbeside the letter \u201c\\(E\\)\u201d. \n\nHowever, it is important before going much further to note that in\nEinstein\u2019s equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\), the symbol \\(m\\) is the mass\nof an object as measured in the inertial frame in which that\nobject is at rest. Physicists also call this mass \\(m\\) the\n\u201crest-mass\u201d of the object. The rest-mass of an object is\nnumerically equal to its Newtonian inertial mass, though arguably the\nsymbol \\(m\\) (or the corresponding term \u201cmass\u201d) has\ndifferent meanings in Newtonian and relativistic physics (see, e.g.,\nKuhn 1962, p. 101 ff. and Torretti 1990, p. 65 ff.). \n\nFurthermore, there are conceptual reasons why both Einstein and many\ncontemporary physicists do not add a subscript \u201c\\(o\\)\u201d to\n\\(m\\) when denoting rest-mass. For example, Taylor and Wheeler argue\nthat the phrase \u201crest-mass\u201d engenders potential confusion\nas it might lead the reader to ask: What happens to the rest-mass when\nthe object is moving? Answer: nothing (Taylor and Wheeler 1992, p.\n251). The rest-mass of an object is an invariant quantity in special\nrelativity; it has the same value for all inertial observers. Taylor\nand Wheeler quip: \u201cIn reality mass is mass is mass\u201d\n(Taylor and Wheeler 1992, p. 251). From their perspective, which is\nquite standard now in physics textbooks and articles, there is no need\nto prefix the term \u201cmass\u201d with \u201crest,\u201d because\nthere is no other kind of mass worth speaking about in special\nrelativity (see\n Section 1.6).\n \n\nHenceforth, we will adopt the accepted convention, though it is\nadmittedly not universally followed especially in older sources, of\nusing the following symbols with their stated meanings (see Table 1): \n\n\nSymbol Meaning\n\\(E\\)\nThe total energy of a physical system, unless otherwise\nindicated \n\\(E_o\\)\nThe rest energy of a physical system or an amount of energy\nas measured in the rest frame of an object (typically energy that is\nemitted or absorbed by an object)\n\\(m\\)\nThe mass (i.e., rest-mass) of a physical system \n\nTable 1. Notation used in this entry\n\n\nWe will first focus on the mechanics of idealized point particles in\nspecial relativity. Regardless of the macroscopic objects they\nrepresent, we shall treat such particles, and by extension the\ncorresponding physical objects, as un-analyzable wholes. We will then\nseparately discuss \u201ccomposite systems\u201d or systems composed\nof such particles. Physicists use composite systems to approximate\nphysical objects when they are interested in examining the\n\u201cinner workings\u201d of such objects, such as when they treat\na gas as a collection of idealized particles. \n",
