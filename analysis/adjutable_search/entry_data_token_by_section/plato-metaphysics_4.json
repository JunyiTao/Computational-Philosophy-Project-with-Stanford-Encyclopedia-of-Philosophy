    "main_text": "The Separation of Forms\n5. The Separation of Forms\n\n\nThe best guide to the separation of Forms is the claim that each\nForm is what it is in its own right, each is an auto kath auto\nbeing. In asking \u2018What is (the Form) F?\u2019, Plato\nseeks what F is in a particular and special way: He\nseeks what F is independent from any of its material\ninstances, and in some sense independent of anything else, whether\nanother Form or the soul. What each Form is, what each Form is in its\nown right, it is in virtue of its essence, ousia. The\nconnection between the Form and the essence being predicated of it is\nexhibited in the Republic's formula that a given on\n(being) is completely or perfectly (477ff), as well as the so-called\nself-predication statements. According to the predicationalist reading,\nthe relation connecting an essence with that Form of which it is the\nessence is\n Being (see Code 1986, esp. 425\u20139).\n (I capitalize the \u2018is\u2019 used to\nrepresent the predication relation of Being, e.g., Justice Is just.)\nThe predicate in such self-predication statements stands for the (real)\ndefinition of the Form, conveniently captured by Nehamas' \u2018what\nit is to be\n F\u2019.[9]\n Each Form, then Is\nits essence.\n\n\nThe special relationship between a Form and its essence is captured\nin two principles\n\nEach essence is the essence of exactly one\nForm.\nEach Form has (or is) exactly one\n essence;[10]\n\n\n\nII captures the ontological force of the expression that each Form\nis monoeides: of one essence. In light of these\nprinciples, and in keeping with the account of the ontological relation\nof Being, it follows that each Form self-predicates, in so far\nas each Form Is its essence. Self-predication statements are thus\nrequired of Forms, since every Form must Be its respective essence.\nSelf-predication, then, is a constitutional principle of the very\ntheory of Forms. A Form, then, is what it is in its own right in\nthat it Is its essence, and since the only thing it Is is its essence,\neach Form is monoeides, \u2018of one essence\u2019. In\nvirtue of Being its essence, each Form Is something regardless of\nwhether any particular does or even may participate in it. Thus each\nForm is separate from every particular instance of it.\nMoreover, since its essence is predicated of the Form independently\nfrom our knowledge of the Form or from its relation to another Form, a\nForm is not dependent on anything else. On this definitional\ninterpretation of separation, an item is separate just in case the\ndefinition (essence) is predicable of it and not of what it is alleged\nto be separate from. So, a Form is separate from particulars that\npartake of it, or any particular, if the essence is predicable of the\nForm and not predicable of the particular/s. Whether or not a Form is\nexistentially separate, i.e., whether it exists\nseparate from everything else, turns on whether one thinks that being\nan essence qualifies the Form as existing. To the extent that Plato\nrecognizes the notion of existence, since being an essence seems, by\nPlato's lights, to be the superlative way to be, it is likely that\nForms are both definitionally and existentially separate.\n",
