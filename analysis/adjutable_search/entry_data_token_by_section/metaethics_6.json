    "main_text": "Freedom and Responsibility\n7. Freedom and Responsibility\n\nMaking sense of how moral considerations might figure in practical\ndeliberation is especially important when it comes to explaining when\nand why people are responsible for what they do or fail to do. Some of\nthat explanatory job is a matter of moral theory, not metaethics, and\ninvolves figuring out what counts as good excuses, legitimate\njustifications, and appropriate burdens. A theory of moral\nresponsibility inevitably relies on substantive moral theory.\n\nYet there are important metaethical issues bound up in giving an\naccount of moral responsibility. They emerge most sharply as one\nconsiders the nature and significance of free will. Does\nresponsibility presuppose free will? If so, when does someone count as\nhaving a free will? It cannot merely be a matter of her will being\nuncaused. After all, a person whose will was utterly random,\nresponsive neither to her nor to the reasons she had for doing things,\nwould be a person no freer (in the relevant sense) than a person whose\nwill was fully and directly controlled by someone else as a puppeteer\nmight control a puppet. What would it take for her will to count as\nappropriately responsive, either to her or to her reasons? Is this\nappropriate responsiveness a matter of being undetermined or of being\ndetermined by the right things or in the right way? In any case, if\none has the sort of free will that moral responsibility requires\n(whatever that turns out to be) how are we to understand the\nconnection between the will, and what influences it, on the one hand,\nand the various psychological and physical causes that apparently\ndetermine the behavior that is identified as the action one performs\nwillingly, on the other? How do agents with a free will fit within a\nnatural world?\n\nNot surprisingly, the range of answers that have been offered to these\nquestions covers an exceedingly broad spectrum. Some hold that moral\nresponsibility requires a certain kind of freedom and then argue that\nwe lack that sort of freedom or, alternatively, that we at least\nsometimes have it. Others, though, maintain that freedom is irrelevant\nand that holding people morally responsible makes sense only if we see\ntheir wills as determined. And others identify a truly free will not\nwith a will that is undetermined, but with one that is determined by\nreason. And still others argue that the right understanding of moral\nresponsibility will show that metaphysical questions concerning the\nnature of the will are irrelevant. (See the entries on\n free will\n and\n moral responsibility.)\n",
