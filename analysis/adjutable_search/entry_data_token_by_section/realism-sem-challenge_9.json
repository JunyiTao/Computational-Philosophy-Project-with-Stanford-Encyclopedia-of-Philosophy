    "main_text": "Realist Responses || Radical Skepticism\n4.3 Radical Skepticism\n\nThe Brains-in-a-Vat argument purports to show that, given semantic\nexternalism, realism is incoherent on the grounds that it is both\ncommitted to the genuine possibility of our being brains in a vat and\nyet entails something that anti-realists judge to be inconsistent with\nthis: namely, that were we to be so envatted we could not possibly\nhave the thought that we were.\n\nRealists have three obvious responses.\n\n Deny realism entails that we could be brains in a vat.\n Deny semantic externalism.\n Deny there is any inconsistency between our being brains in a vat\nand our inability to think that we were brains in a vat were we to be\nso.\n\n\nAs for (i), one might question the coherence of the idea of our being\nbrains in a vat on the grounds that the skeptical hypothesis uses\nterms which derive their meaning from successful theory to pose a\nproblem which, if intelligible, would rob those very terms of meaning.\n\n\nWhat of option (ii)\u2014denying semantic externalism? Is this really\na live prospect for realists? Semantic externalism no longer commands\nthe consensus amongst realists that it did when Putnam formulated his\nBrains-in-a-Vat argument. David Lewis, a prominent realist, rejected\nexternalism in favour of a sophisticated semantic internalism based on\na \u2018Two-Dimensional\u2019 analysis of modality proposed by\nStalnaker [Lewis 1994]. Frank Jackson [Jackson 2000] contributed to\nthe development of internalist 2D semantics and used it to formulate a\nversion of materialism grounded on conceptual analysis that provides a\nuseful model of a physicalistic realist\u2019s metaphysics.\n\nOther realists reject externalism because they think that the\nRepresentation Problem is just a pseudo-problem. When we say things\nlike \u201c\u2018cat\u2019 refers to cats\u201d or\n\u201c\u2018quark\u2019 refers to quarks\u201d we are simply\nregistering our dispositions to call everything we consider\nsufficiently cat-like/quark-like,\n\u2018cat\u2019/\u2019quark\u2019 [Horwich, 1990; Resnick,\n1990].\n\nAccording to these semantic deflationists, it is just a confusion to\nask how the link was set up between our use of the term \u2018the Big\nBang\u2019 and the event of that name which occurred some fourteen\nbillion years ago. Yet, if all there is to the story are our\nlinguistic dispositions and the conditions to which they are presently\nattuned, the case has effectively been ceded to the anti-realist who\ndenies it is possible to set up a correlation between our utterances\nor thoughts and mind-independent states of affairs. \n\nPerhaps the most effective realist rejoinder is (iii). We shall return\nto this response after we have reviewed Putnam\u2019s Brains-in-a-Vat\nArgument, BIVA.\n\nHow does Putnam prove we can know we are not brains in a vat? To\nunderstand Putnam\u2019s argument, we need to first recall the\n\u2018Twin-Earth\u2019 considerations used to support Semantic\nExternalism: on Twin-Earth things are exactly as they are here on\nEarth except for one difference\u2014whereas for Earthly humans water\nhas the chemical composition H2O, for our\nd\u00f6ppelgangers on Twin-Earth, twumans, water is instead composed\nof some substance unknown to us on Earth, XYZ. Now when you and your\ntwuman counterpart say (or think) \u201c\u2018Water\u2019 refers to\nwater\u201d both of you utter (or think) truths. But which truth you\nboth think or utter differs. For humans \u201c\u2018Water\u2019\nrefers to water\u201d expresses the truth that the term\n\u2018water\u2019 in English refers to that substance whose chemical\ncomposition is H2O. For our twuman Twin-Earth counterparts,\nhowever, their sentence \u201c\u2018Water\u2019 refers to\nwater\u201d expresses the truth that their term \u2018water\u2019\nin Twenglish refers to that substance whose chemical composition is\nXYZ.\n\nWith these points about Externalism in mind, consider Putnam\u2019s\nBIVA [we follow the formulation section 7 of the entry\n skepticism and content externalism].\n Let us call whatever it is that an envatted brain\u2019s symbol\n\u2018tree\u2019 refers to, if it refers at all,\n\\(v\\)-trees. Then the BIVA is: \n\n(1)  If I\u2019m a BIV\nthen it is not the case that if my word \u2018tree\u2019 refers it\nrefers to trees. \n(2)  If my word\n\u2018tree\u2019 refers it refers to trees. \n(3)  So, I am\nnot a BIV. \n\n\nNow (1) seems correct: if I am a brain-in-a-vat then, given\nexternalism, my symbol \u2018tree\u2019 cannot refer to trees since\nthere aren\u2019t any trees in the vat-world\u2014a BIV\u2019s\n\u2018tree\u2019 symbol refers to \\(v\\)-trees, not\ntrees. But what reason do we have to believe (2)? If we are BIVs\nwon\u2019t our \u2018tree\u2019 symbols refer to v-trees rather\nthan trees? Crispin Wright [1992b] argues that all language-users,\nwhether humans or brains-in-a-vat, can be certain of (2) since they\ncan know they use language meaningfully and thus can know that their\nlanguage disquotes. Graeme Forbes [1995] questions Wright\u2019s\nargument. \n\nDiscussion of the brains-in-a-vat hypothesis has been extensive. Early\ncontributions by Brueckner 1986, 1992; David 1991; Ebbs 1992; Forbes\n1995 reconstruct Putnam\u2019s argument and assess it from a realist\nperspective. Important defences of the BIVA are provided by Wright\n1992b; Tymoczko 1989; Button 2013, 2015. Some recent discussions bring\nBayesian [Huemer 2016] or psychological [Jackson 2015] considerations\nto bear on Putnam\u2019s BIV hypothesis. A valuable collection of\nessays is Goldberg 2015.\n\nEven if it were to turn out that the BIVA is not sound, Putnam\u2019s\nchallenge to the realist remains unanswered. This was to show how\nrealism could be coherent if it is committed both to:\n\n(I)  The real\npossibility that we are brains-in-a-vat \n\n\nand to the consequence that:\n\n(II)  Were we to be\nBIVs we could not have the thought that we were. \n\n\nWhile it is usually not remarked upon, there is no logical\nincoherence in accepting both (I) and (II)\u2014as the figure below\nillustrates. There is thus no logical incoherence in believing both\nthat it is possible that one is a BIV and that if one is a BIV one\ncould never come to know this. \n\n\n\nFigure. Consider a universe of 4 worlds.\nIf we are not in fact brains-in-a-vat (so that the hypothesis\n\\(v\\) that we are brains in a vat is false, \\(\\neg v\\) is true at\n\\(w^*\\), the actual world) we can nonetheless entertain \\((E)\\), the\nhypothesis that we are (so that \\(Ev\\) is true at \\(w^*\\)),\nrecognizing as we do so that were we to inhabit a world such as \\(w'\\)\nin which we are brains-in-a-vat (\\(v\\) holds at \\(w'\\)), we would lack\nthe semantic resources to articulate thoughts reflecting our own\nenvatted state so that we could not so much as entertain the\nthought that we were brains-in-a-vat (\\(\\neg Ev\\) holds not only at\n\\(w'\\) but at all those worlds ( \\(w''\\), \\(w'''\\)) accessible from\n\\(w'\\)).\n\n\nNick Bostrom has recently argued it is quite likely that we humans are\nactually virtual humans: computer simulations of flesh and\nblood creatures. Bostrom reasons that if our mental lives can be\nsimulated then it is highly probable that our distant descendants\n(more intelligent or at least more technologically advanced\n\u2018post-human\u2019 successors) will eventually create such a\nsimulation in which case it is more likely that we are the unwitting\ndenizens of a simulated world than the flesh and blood inhabitants of\nthe real world we take ourselves to be. At least this will be so\nunless the chances that creatures of our intelligence are doomed to\nbecome extinct before reaching the technological sophistication to\ncreate simulations are overwhelmingly large or else almost no such\ntechnologically capable civilizations have any interest in simulating\nminds like ours in the first place [Bostrom, N., 2003]. \n\nBostrom\u2019s position owes nothing to skepticism, he is concerned\nsolely with the question of whether virtual humans are empirically\npossible and, if so, how likely it is that we might be such beings.\nHis argument, if sound, makes it look very doubtful that we can know\na priori that we are not brains-in-a-vat,\nwhen BIVs are understood to be virtual humans in a\n simulation.[6]\n If Bostrom is correct, Putnam\u2019s attempt to prove we cannot\nbe BIVs must be flawed. However, the Simulation Argument is\nnothing if not controversial: it has provoked interest from\ncosmologists as well as philosophers [For discussion of the Simulation\nHypothesis see Bostrom, 2005; Brueckner 2008; Chalmers 2010;\nWeatherson 2003]. \n",
