Locke\u2019s Major Works on Education\n\nLocke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning Education and his\nConduct of the Understanding form a nice bridge between\nAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his political\nworks. Ruth Grant and Nathan Tarcov write in the introduction to their\nedition of these works:\n\n\nThe idea of liberty, so crucial to all of Locke\u2019s writings on\npolitics and education, is traced in the Essay to reflection on the\npower of the mind over one\u2019s own actions, especially the power\nto suspend actions in the pursuit of the satisfaction of one\u2019s\nown desires until after a full consideration of their objects\n(II.21.47, N: 51\u201352). The Essay thus shows how the independence\nof mind pursued in the Conduct is possible. (G&T 1996:\nxvi)\n\n\nSome Thoughts Concerning Education was first published in\n1693. This book collected together advice that Locke had been giving\nhis friend Edward Clarke about the education of Clarke\u2019s son\n(and also his daughters) since 1684. In preparing the revision for the\nfourth edition of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke began writing a chapter called \u201cThe Conduct of the\nUnderstanding\u201d. This became quite long and was never added to\nthe Essay or even finished. It was left to Locke\u2019s\nliterary executors to decide what to do with it. The Conduct\nwas published by Peter King in his posthumous edition of some of\nLocke\u2019s works in 1706. As Locke was composing these works, some\nof the material from the Conduct eventually made its way into\nthe Thoughts. Grant and Tarcov write that the\nThoughts and the Conduct \u201ccomplement each\nother well: the Thoughts focuses on the education of children\nby their parents, whereas the Conduct addresses the\nself-education of adults\u201d (G&T 1996: vii). Though they also\nnote tensions between the two that illustrate paradoxes in liberal\nsociety. The Thoughts is addressed to the education of the\nsons and daughters of the English gentry in the late seventeenth\ncentury. It is in some ways thus significantly more limited to its\ntime and place than the Conduct. Yet, its insistence on the\ninculcating such virtues as\n\n\njustice as respect for the rights of others, civility, liberality,\nhumanity, self-denial, industry, thrift, courage, truthfulness, and a\nwillingness to question prejudice, authority and the biases of\none\u2019s own self-interest\n\n\nvery likely represents the qualities needed for citizens in a liberal\nsociety (G&T 1996: xiii).\n\nLocke\u2019s Thoughts represents the culmination of a\ncentury of what has been called \u201cthe discovery of the\nchild\u201d. In the Middle Ages the child was regarded as\n\n\nonly a simple plaything, as a simple animal, or a miniature adult who\ndressed, played and was supposed to act like his elders\u2026Their\nages were unimportant and therefore seldom known. Their education was\nundifferentiated, either by age, ability or intended occupation.\n(Axtell 1968: 63\u20134)\n\n\nLocke treated children as human beings in whom the gradual development\nof rationality needed to be fostered by parents. Locke urged parents\nto spend time with their children and tailor their education to their\ncharacter and idiosyncrasies, to develop both a sound body and\ncharacter, and to make play the chief strategy for learning rather\nthan rote learning or punishment. Thus, he urged learning languages by\nlearning to converse in them before learning rules of grammar. Locke\nalso suggests that the child learn at least one manual trade.\n\nIn advocating a kind of education that made people who think for\nthemselves, Locke was preparing people to effectively make decisions\nin their own lives\u2014to engage in individual\nself-government\u2014and to participate in the government of their\ncountry. The Conduct reveals the connections Locke sees\nbetween reason, freedom and morality. Reason is required for good\nself-government because reason insofar as it is free from partiality,\nintolerance and passion and able to question authority leads to fair\njudgment and action. We thus have a responsibility to cultivate reason\nin order to avoid the moral failings of passion, partiality and so\nforth (G&T 1996: xii). This is, in Tarcov\u2019s phrase,\nLocke\u2019s education for liberty.\n\nWe turn now to Locke\u2019s political writings. (See the entry on\n Locke\u2019s political philosophy,\n which focuses on five topics (the state of nature, natural law,\nproperty, consent and toleration) and goes into these topics in more\ndepth than is possible in a general account and provides much useful\ninformation on the debates about them.)\n",
