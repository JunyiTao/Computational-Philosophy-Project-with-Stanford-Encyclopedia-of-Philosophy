Philosophical Character of Political Disposition\n\n\nBurke\u2019s thinking about America also suggests a political disposition\nthat owed something to his philosophical conceptions. Burke\u2019s complaint\nin American Taxation against ministers was that \u2018they\nhave taken things\u2026without any regard to their relations or\ndependencies\u2019, and had \u2018no one connected view.\u2019 This\nwas in part a straightforwardly cognitive position on which Burke laid an emphasis with prudential point: the world with which politicians dealt was complex, and to use\nideas which were insufficiently complex to capture its contents and\ntheir relations was a short way to meet the rough side of\nreality. It was also, implicitly an ethical position: governments\nought not to apply force to existing relations, at least those that\nwere legitimate. This is, in one way, an obvious point from natural\njurisprudence, and one that Burke had made transparently with respect\nto inroads by the government of Ireland against Catholic property. In\nanother, and more interesting way, it reflected his view that abstract\ncompound nouns and complex ideas evoke specific past experiences. To\ninterfere forcibly with someone\u2019s experientially-based expectations\nwould be to break their mental association between experience and idea\nor word: and so the idea or the word would become meaningless and\ncease to influence action. If, therefore, \u2018my hold of the\nColonies, is in the close affection which grows from common\nnames\u2019, amongst other sources that were \u2018though light as\nair\u2026as strong as links of iron\u2019, then \u2018let the\nColonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with\nyour Government;\u2014they will cling and grapple to you\u2026But\nlet it be once understood, that your Government may be one thing, and\ntheir Privileges another; that these two things may exist without any\nmutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and\nevery thing hastens to decay and dissolution.\u2019 (CWA, W & S\n1981\u20132015, iii. 164). To break such mental associations was to\nbreak communities.\n\n\nThis point suggested that a genuinely prudent conduct of affairs\nwould proceed without assaulting the mental associations of the\ngoverned, and, as change was omnipresent, would conduct its share under\naccepted names\u2014in other words, by gradual and by moderate\nreform of institutions and practices rather than by immediate and total\nreplacement, which Burke stigmatised as \u2018innovation\u2019. This,\nindeed, was what Burke claimed to be doing in his contributions of\n1780\u201382 to the recasting of the royal household. The intellectual\ncounterpart of this prudent conduct, namely the refinement of our\nexisting ideas, rather than replacing them, is what he had done in his\nrevisions of the idea of sovereignty.\n\n\nThis style of thinking gave Burke a very lively sense of the corrosive\npower of new ideas. Even new questions could have unpleasant\nresults. When the innovations of the British government unsettled the\ncolonists, \u2018then\u2026they questioned all the parts of your\nlegislative power; and by the battery of such questions have shaken\nthe solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations.\u2019\nThe proper way to avoid such shakes to civil society was to\n\u2018consult and follow your experience\u2019 (ATX, W & S\n1981\u20132015, ii.411, 457), for \u2018experience\u2019 according\nto Burke\u2019s philosophy of language was a condition of continuity of\nmind, and, on the basis of mind, of a sustainable practice. His was\ntherefore a philosophically conditioned attitude to practice, and one\nthat was very sensitive to the hiatus that speculation could cause in\nthe latter. Burke\u2019s sensitivity can produce apodictic language in\norder to persuade people to make use of the ideas they have inherited,\nby urging \u2018a total renunciation of every speculation of my own;\nand\u2026 [by recommending] a profound reverence for the wisdom of\nour ancestors\u2019 (CWA, W & S 1981\u20132015,\niii.139). Indeed, Burke can be found, sometimes, on such rational\ngrounds, deprecating all explicit appeal to speculation of whatever\nhue, if it had a disturbing effect: \u2018reason not at\nall\u2014oppose the ancient policy and practice of the empire, as a\nrampart against the speculations of innovators on\nboth sides of the question\u2019 (italics added) (ATX,\nW & S 1981\u20132015, ii.166). His deprecation of speculation was logically\nanterior to taking sides in politics.\n\n\nIt was also, in effect, an appeal for ideas adequate to governing.\nThis is evident in Burke\u2019s criticism of \u2018vulgar and mechanical\npoliticians\u2019,\na sort of people who think that nothing exists but what is\ngross and material; and who therefore, far from being qualified to be\ndirectors of the great movement of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel\nin the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly\ntaught,\u2026ruling and master principles, which, in the opinion of\nsuch men as I have mentioned, have no substantial existence, are in\ntruth every thing, and all in all,\n\n\nso that \u2018little minds\u2019 could not govern \u2018a great\nempire\u2019 (CWA, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii.139), or,\nevidently, any empire at all, whereas better results might be expected\nfrom \u2018men truly initiated and rightly taught.\u2019\n\n\nBurke himself, however much he might try to set the logic of his\nthought in a rich foliage of words generated by his literary skill\nwith words\u2014he is perhaps the only classic of political thought\nin the English language who is also a literary classic\u2014was a\nphilosophical thinker. As such, his practical conclusions could\nchange, and did, as we have seen. Practical conclusions changed\nbecause they were meant to be serviceable in a world that itself was\nchanging.  Burke\u2019s philosophical equipment, however, served him in the\nface of all external changes. The most dramatic of such changes came\nduring the last eight years of his life with the French\nRevolution. \n",
