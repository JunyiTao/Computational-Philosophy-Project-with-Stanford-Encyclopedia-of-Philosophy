    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Metaphysics and the Theory of the Absolute\n3.2 Metaphysics and the Theory of the Absolute\n\nBosanquet\u2019s publications on metaphysics date from the late\n1880s, but it was not until the early 1910s, when he was in his 60s,\nthat he published his comprehensive statement on the topic\u2014his\nGifford lectures, The Principle of Individuality and Value\nand The Value and Destiny of the Individual. It is important\nto realise that it was only after he had developed his views in\nethics, social work, philosophical psychology, and political\nphilosophy, that his metaphysics took its final form. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s first essays on metaphysics\u2014\u201cIs Mind\nSynonymous with Consciousness?\u201d and \u201cWhat Takes Place in\nVoluntary Action?\u201d\u2014focused on the nature of mind, and in\n1893\u201394 he offered a course of lectures that became the basis of\nhis book, Psychology of the Moral Self (1897). Opposed to the\ncrude associationist and the \u2018push and pull\u2019 psychology of\nempiricists (such as David Hume, J.S. Mill, and Alexander Bain) who\nheld that thought consists of disconnected, discrete data of the\nsenses, and the \u2018psychological habits\u2019 that arise out of\nthe contiguous relations of these data, Bosanquet argued that one\ncannot separate the human individual from everything makes up its\nworld. It does not follow, however, that reality is not autonomous of\nindividual consciousness. Bosanquet writes that \u201ceverything is\nreal so long as you do not take it for more than it is\u201d\n(Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 240, see\nLogic, Vol. 1, p. 273) (see Hamilton Grant 2015).\n\nA key interest of Bosanquet was the articulation of a theory of mind\nand will. In Psychology of the Moral Self, in a lecture on\n\u201cThe Organisation of Intelligence\u201d, Bosanquet argues that\n\u201c[t]he psychical elements of the mind are so grouped and\ninterconnected as to constitute what are technically known as\nAppercipient masses or systems\u201d (op. cit., p. 42). The\nmind or self, then, is a multiplicity of such systems. Bosanquet\ndescribes the mind, then, as \u201ca growth of material, more like a\nprocess of crystallization, the material moulding itself according to\nits own affinities and cohesions\u201d (op. cit., p.\n9)\u2014a view which, he says, is implicit in Plato and\nAristotle.\n\nIn his Gifford lectures, Bosanquet moves beyond the discussion of mind\nin order to focus on a principle underlying much of his philosophical\nthought and rooted in his studies in logic\u2014individuality. \n\nIn the first series of Gifford lectures, The Principle of\nIndividuality and Value, Bosanquet holds that when we speak of\n\u2018the real\u2019 or \u2018truth\u2019, we have in mind a\n\u2018whole\u2019 (i.e., a system of connected members), and it is\nby seeing a thing in its relation to others that we can say not only\nthat we have a better knowledge of that thing, but that it is, as\nBosanquet writes, \u201cmore complete\u201d, more true, and more\nreal. Since this whole is self-contained and self-sufficient,\nBosanquet calls it (following Aristotle) an \u2018individual\u2019.\nBut because of its \u2018independence\u2019 and self explanatory\ncharacter or necessity, it is also a universal. The\n\u2018whole\u2019 is, then, what Bosanquet calls a \u201cconcrete\nuniversal\u201d. This \u201clogical universal as a living\nworld\u201d he calls \u201cindividuality\u201d or \u201cthe\nAbsolute\u201d (op. cit., p. xx), and the metaphysical\nposition he adopts is often referred to \u2018absolute\nidealism\u2019.\n\nAccording to Bosanquet, the \u201cmainspring of movement and effort\nin [the finite] world\u201d is \u201ccontradiction\u201d (op.\ncit., p. xxviii). Nevertheless, as principles come into conflict,\na process of harmonisation also occurs. Terms are readjusted or new\ndistinctions are introduced, so that conflicting elements find a place\nin the result. This process or method of meeting and removing\ncontradiction, characteristic of the growth of any thing, is what\nBosanquet calls the argument a contingentia mundi, and it is\nthrough this process that we come to the Absolute. \n\nIndividuality is the principle of value. Since individuality is\n\u201clogical self-completeness [and] freedom from incoherence\u201d\n(op. cit., p. xxxi), Bosanquet holds that, in as far as\nthings are completely organised and have parts which confirm and\nsustain one another, they have value; it is not a matter of whether\nthey are, as in utilitarian accounts, desired. \n\nIn Bosanquet\u2019s metaphysics, there is no rigid line between\n\u2018nature\u2019 or the physical, and \u2018mind,\u2019 and it\nmakes no sense to talk of a \u2018transcendent,\u2019 as some kind\nof \u2018supernatural\u2019 world (see \u201cThe True Conception of\nAnother World\u201d; see also Mander 2017: 242). Bosanquet is clearly\nopposed to dualism; he sees the mind as \u201ca perfection and\ncooperation of the adaptations and acquisitions stored in the\nbody\u201d (op. cit., p. xxv) and not a separate thing,\nindependent of the body. Bosanquet\u2019s anti-dualism does not,\nhowever, lead to panpsychism\u2014the view that all nature has\nconsciousness. (In this respect he appears to differ from F.H.\nBradley.) Still, he argues that nature is complete only through human\nconsciousness. Human consciousness serves, Bosanquet holds, as a\n\u201ccopula\u201d between nature and the Absolute. \n\nIn the second series of Gifford lectures, The Value and Destiny of\nthe Individual, Bosanquet focuses on how his theory of the\nAbsolute bears on the nature and value of the finite (i.e., human)\nindividual. He does so, first, by saying something of the evolution or\ndevelopment of the human person, as both a natural being and a being\npossessing a self-determining will; then, by looking at finite beings\nin relation to one another; and, finally, by showing how finite\nselfhood can have stability and security. Progress in the development\nof the human individual, Bosanquet suggests, is not serial nor should\nit be seen as approximation towards a defined telos. The destiny of\nthe finite self is that it comes to recognise itself as an element of\nthe Absolute; it is in relation to this, Bosanquet says, that one sees\nits value.\n\nSome critics responded that Bosanquet\u2019s arguments radically\nreduced or eliminated the value of the human person because, they\nclaimed, the \u201cperfection of human personality\u201d that he\nadvocated was not the development of a finite individual as a finite\nindividual. This issue was the focus of an important exchange among\nBosanquet, Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, G.F. Stout, and R.B. Haldane\non \u201cDo Individuals Possess a Substantive or Adjectival Mode of\nBeing?\u201d (Bosanquet et al. 1918). Here, Bosanquet asserts that\nindividuals characterise the world \u201cas permanent\nqualifications\u201d\u2014but, at the same time, he reiterates his\nview that finite selves are not \u201cnecessarily eternal or\neverlasting units\u201d (op. cit., pp. 86\u201387). Still,\none may say that while Bosanquet\u2019s absolute idealism leads him\nto reject certain conceptions of the self, he does not reject its\nexistence or its value. He simply denies that finite individuals are\nwholly independent centres or ultimate principles of value. Extensive\nscholarship by Mander (2005) and Sweet (1997a) suggest that\nBosanquet\u2019s case was stronger than Pringle-Pattison\u2019s.\n\nAlthough Bosanquet described his approach as \u2018idealist\u2019,\nhe was aware that the term was broad and potentially misleading. In\nwork published after the Gifford lectures, Bosanquet took pains to try\nto explain how his view was entirely unlike the subjective idealism\nchallenged by G.E. Moore\u2019s \u201cThe Refutation of\nIdealism\u201d (1903) and, in \u201cRealism and Metaphysic\u201d\n(1917), Bosanquet suggested that his philosophy could be more\naccurately described as \u201cspeculative\u201d.\n\nBosanquet pursued this issue of the character of his philosophy in\nThe Distinction between Mind and its Objects (1913) and in\nthe last book to be published during his lifetime, The Meeting of\nExtremes in Contemporary Philosophy (1921).\n\nIn The Distinction between Mind and its Objects\u2014which\ndealt with common characteristics of American neo-realism and Italian\nneo-idealism (specifically, that of Benedetto Croce and Giovanni\nGentile), and the relation of his own account to that of philosophical\nrealism and the neo-realists\u2014Bosanquet argued that the terms\n\u2018idealism\u2019 and \u2018realism\u2019 are both vague and\nmisleading. There are, as he notes, different kinds of realism and\ndifferent kinds of idealism as well. Moreover, the terms are not\nantithetical; in fact, Bosanquet saw some affinity between his\nposition and that of the realist Samuel Alexander. Nevertheless,\nBosanquet thoroughly rejected the views of such authors as R.B. Perry,\nW.P. Montague, and E.B. Holt. He argued that, while aiming at\nproviding a comprehensive view of reality, this \u2018new\nrealism\u2019 restricts the place of mind and cuts it off from\nphysical reality. (For a recent mention, see Hamilton Grant, in\nFerraris 2014: 10). \n\nThe very title of The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary\nPhilosophy (1921) reveals Bosanquet\u2019s conviction that,\ndespite the apparently radical differences separating them, there is a\nconvergence both in aim and in result of the investigations of the\ndifferent dominant philosophical schools \u2014for example, on such\nmatters as the reality of time, positive development in ethics, and\nhuman progress. Bosanquet notes that, although there is a clear\ndisagreement among critical realists and absolutists concerning the\nnature of \u2018the real\u2019, as each seeks a complete account, it\nis led to positions that are characteristic of its\n\u2018opponent\u2019. Bosanquet\u2019s own \u201cspeculative\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014based, he maintains, on careful analysis of\nexperience\u2014complements both of the preceding approaches.\nBosanquet argued that, with a more reasoned understanding of progress\nand a correct account of the nature of \u2018individuality\u2019 and\nthe \u2018unity\u2019 of reality (where mind and its objects are\nseen together in a single context), the absurdities of the extremes of\nidealism and realism can be avoided, and the opposition between them\ncan be overcome. \n",
