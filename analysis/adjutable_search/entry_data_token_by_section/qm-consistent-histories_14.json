    "main_text": "Classical Physics\n6. Classical Physics\nThe histories approach assumes that the same fundamental quantum\nmechanical laws apply to systems of any size, from quarks to jaguars\nto quasars. Classical mechanics is a very good approximation to the\nmore exact quantum laws in appropriate circumstances. The following\nremarks \nprovide only a broad outline of how the classical world\nemerges from quantum theory; see the \n Further Reading supplement for additional\nmaterial.\n\n\nThe first task is to identify suitable quasiclassical\nframeworks, appropriate choices of projective decompositions of the\nidentity at a single time corresponding to macroscopic properties,\ntogether with suitable quantum histories that involve such properties,\nwith results which correspond closely to the time development of\nclassical physics. The desired decompositions will be coarse grained,\nwith individual projectors corresponding to subspaces of enormous\ndimension (e.g., 10 raised to the power \\(10^{16}\\)). In such a\nsituation it is plausible that there are families containing quantum\nhistories having a probability very close to 1, and which exhibit a\ntime development that closely approximates that of classical\nmechanics.\nTo be sure, the task of showing that classical laws emerge to a\ngood approximation in this manner is a nontrivial one, and it cannot\nbe claimed that it has been completed. However, the effort expended\nthus far has not revealed any fundamental difficulty which would\nundermine this approach. One also expects to find cases in which the\nrelevant quantum probabilities are not close to 0 or 1; in particular\nin a regime where classical analysis predicts chaos (positive Lyapunov\nexponents) quantum \u201cfluctuations\u201d are likely to be\namplified. But this is also a situation in which the deterministic\naspect of classical time development is not to be taken too seriously,\ndue to the sensitive dependence upon initial conditions, so there is\nno reason to suppose that an appropriate quantum description cannot be\nconstructed, at least in principle.\nUnderstanding the emergence of classical physics from the quantum\nworld does not require a unique quasiclassical framework; there are\nundoubtedly a large number of different possibilities, any one of\nwhich could for the circumstances of interest provide\n\u201cclassical\u201d results within a suitable approximation\n(further comments on nonuniqueness will be found\nin subsection 11.3 below). In constructing a\nquasiclassical description decoherence plays a useful role in\nthe sense that it removes the effects of quantum interference which\nmight otherwise render a quasiclassical family inconsistent,\npreventing the application of the Born rule and its\ngeneralizations. Once again, this statement can be supported by model\ncalculations of an appropriate sort which make it plausible, but work\nstill remains to be done in coming to a full understanding of\ndecoherence in quantum terms. Invoking decoherence by itself outside\nthe framework provided by the histories approach does not solve the\nconceptual difficulties of quantum theory; see,\ne.g., Adler (2003).\n",
