A bronze sphere is a\nperceptible magnitude. For solving the plurality problem, Aristotle\nneeds to have many triangles with the same form. Since perceptible\nmatter is not part of the object considered (in abstraction or\nremoval), he needs to have a notion of matter which is the matter of\nthe object: bronze sphere MINUS bronze (perceptible matter). Since this\nobject must be a composite individual to distinguish it from other\nindividuals with the same form, it will have matter. He calls such\nmatter intelligible or mathematical matter. Aristotle has at least four\ndifferent conceptions of intelligible matter in the middle books of the\nMetaphysics, Physics iv, and De anima i: \n\nThe form of a magnitude is its limit (Metaphysics v.17);\nhence, the matter is what is between the limits of the magnitude, its\nextension (Physics iv 2).\nMatter is the genus, e.g., in the sense that magnitude (and not\nperceptible-magnitude) is the kind for triangles (e.g.,\nMetaphysics v.28, viii.6).\nThe \u2018non-perceptible\u2019 matter of a perceptible\nmagnitude, which is in the perceptible matter (Metaphysics\nvii.10, cf. De anima i.1).\nThe parts of a mathematical object which do not occur in the\ndefinition of the object, e.g., acute angle is not in the definition of\nright angle, but is a part of it and so is a non-perceptible material\npart of the angle (Metaphysics vii.10, 11).\n\n\n\n(1) and (3) are compatible; (2) may be a separate notion having more\nto do with the unity of definition and seems incompatible with (4);\nAristotle treats (3) and (4) as the same notion. Since Aristotle's\nconcern in discussing (4) is with the nature of the parts of\ndefinitions and not with questions of extended matter, it is unclear\nwhether the non-definitional parts are potential extended parts or\nmerely forms of extended parts, although the former seems more\nplausible.\n",
