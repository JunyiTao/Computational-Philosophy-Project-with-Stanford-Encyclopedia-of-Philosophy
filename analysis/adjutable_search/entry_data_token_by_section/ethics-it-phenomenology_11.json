They would rather be concerned\nwith the world (or mood as already suggested) that made these\nartifacts or technologies seem necessary or obvious in the first\nplace. They would also be concerned with the ways in which particular\ntechnologies \u2018frame\u2019 and reveal us, or our world, as we\ndraw on them. They would claim that it is this ongoing co-constitution\nthat we should focus on if we are to understand the social and ethical\nimplications of ICT and new media (Verbeek 2008). This does not\npreclude the possibility that we could also consider the impact of\nparticular technologies as well as unpack particular technologies to\nunderstand the values and interests they imply. However, the\nphenomenologists would argue that the impact analysis\n (section 3.1)\n and the disclosive analysis\n (section 3.2)\n could be enhanced if these were situated in a broader\nphenomenological analysis. Such an additional analysis might add\nanother level of critical reflection that could be important in\nunderstanding and justifying different possible futures. One might\ndescribe the phenomenological approach as an iterative process of\nontological disclosure in which a world (relevant social\npractices or involvement whole) and technology (nexus of relevant\ntechnologies) are taken as mutually constitutive interpretive contexts\nin which the one renders the other intelligible\u2014i.e., grounds it\nas a \u2018seemingly\u2019 meaningful way to be. In this iterative\nprocess there is a progressive uncovering of the constitutive\nconditions that are necessary for particular ways of seeing or doing\nin the world\u2014or in particular social practices\u2014to make\nsense and be meaningful in the way they are taken to be. For example,\nin Heidegger\u2019s analysis of modern technology, as outlined above\nin\n section 2.2,\n he identifies the emergence of calculative thinking as a necessary\ncondition to see the world as resources available for our purposes.\nHowever, this calculative orientation is itself conditioned by a\nparticular way of approaching the world, which he traces back to Greek\nthought. Let us consider this approach in more detail through an\nexample of virtuality. \n",
