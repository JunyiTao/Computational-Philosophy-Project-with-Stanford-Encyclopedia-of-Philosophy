    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n4. Philosophy of Mind\n\nIn \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d (1994b), David Lewis separates his\ncontributions to philosophy of mind into two broad categories. The\nfirst category is his reductionist metaphysics. From his first\npublished philosophy paper, \u201cAn Argument for the Identity\nTheory\u201d (1966a), Lewis defended a version of the mind-brain\nidentity theory (see the entry on the\n identity theory of mind).\n As he makes clear in \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d, this became an\nimportant part of his global reductionism. We\u2019ll look at his\nmetaphysics of mind in sections 4.1\u20134.3.\n\nThe second category is his theory of mental content. Following Donald\nDavidson in broad outlines, Lewis held that the contents of a\nperson\u2019s mental states are those contents that \u2019fit\u2019\nthe typical causal profile of the state. For example, a state\nisn\u2019t constituted by the combination of a\ndesire for some end plus a belief that waving will bring about that\nend, unless it typically causes waving. In this\nrespect Lewis\u2019s views resembled\n interpretationist\n theories of beliefs. But he differed from other interpretationists in\nseveral ways. We will focus here on two of them. Lewis held that\nmental contents are typically properties, not\npropositions. And he held that a theory of mental content\nrequires an inegalitarian theory of properties. We\u2019ll\nlook at his theory of content in sections 4.4\u20134.6.\n",
