    "main_text": "Transworld identity and the transitivity of identity || Responses to the transitivity problem\n5.2 Responses to the transitivity problem\n\nOne reaction to the transitivity puzzle is to abandon transworld\nidentity in favour of counterpart theory. But how\u2014given the\nstructure of the puzzle\u2014can the theorist who wishes to resist\nthat move, and retain transworld identity, respond?\n\nOne response would be to give up any non-trivial version of the\nrestriction principle, and hold that an artefact such as a bicycle\ncould have come into existence with an entirely different material\ncomposition from its actual original composition. Although this\ncounterintuitive view has been defended (for example, Mackie (2006)\nargues for it on grounds independent of the transitivity problem), it\nhas few adherents.\n\nA second response would be to give up the tolerance principle, and\nadopt what Roca-Royes (2016) calls an \u2018inflexible\u2019 version\nof the principle that the material origin of an artefact is essential\nto it, holding that an artefact such as a bicycle could not have come\ninto existence with a material composition in any way different from\nits actual original composition. Although this view is admittedly\ncounterintuitive, Roca-Royes argues that it provides the best solution\nto the \u2018Four Worlds Paradox\u2019 to be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\nA third solution to the transitivity problem has been proposed (by\nChandler, followed by Salmon) which apparently allows us to reconcile\nall three of the transitivity of identity, the tolerance principle,\nand the restriction principle. This is to say that although there\nare possible worlds (such as w3) in which\nthe bicycle is originally composed of only a small proportion of its\nactual original parts, such worlds are not possible relative to (not\n\u2018accessible to\u2019) the initial world w1.\nFrom the standpoint of w1, such an original\ncomposition for the bicycle is only possibly possible: something that\nwould have been possible, had things been different in some possible\nway, but is not, as things are, possible (Chandler 1976; Salmon 1979;\nSalmon 1982, 238\u2013240). Whether this solution is satisfactory is\ndisputed. (See, for example, Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri 2021,\nChs 7\u20138.) Admittedly, there are some contexts in which we talk of\npossibility in a way that may suggest that the \u2018accessibility\nrelation\u2019 between possible worlds is non-transitive: that not\neverything that would have been possible, had things been different in\nsome possible way, is possible simpliciter. (If Ann had\nstarted writing her paper earlier, it would have been possible for her\nto finish it today. And she could have started writing her\npaper earlier. But, as things are, it is not possible for her to\nfinish it today.) Nevertheless, the idea that, as regards the type of\nmetaphysical possibility that is involved in puzzles such as that of\nthe bicycle, there might be states of affairs that are possibly\npossible and yet not possible (and hence that de re\nmetaphysical possibility and necessity do not obey the system of modal\nlogic known as S4) is regarded with suspicion by many\nphilosophers.\n\nIt should be noted that the \u2018non-transitivity of\naccessibility\u2019 response is distinct from an even more radical\nresponse, which rejects the principle of the transitivity of\nidentity\u2014a principle definitive of the classical notion of\nidentity. For example, Priest (2010) denies the transitivity of\nidentity in the context of his dialetheism about truth and a\nparaconsistent logic in which the material conditional does not obey\nthe principle of modus ponens. Discussion of this extreme\nposition is, however, beyond the scope of this article. (On\ndialetheism and paraconsistent logic, see the separate entry on\nDialetheism. On the logic of identity, see the entry on Identity.)\n\nFinally, Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri 2021 propose that, in some\ncases, the combination of (classical) transworld identity, tolerance,\nand the restriction principle can all be retained, yet without denying\n(as do Chandler and Salmon) the transitivity of accessibility between\npossible worlds. They appeal to two principles: a metaphysical\nprinciple of \u2018plenitude\u2019 and a metasemantic principle of \u2018semantic\nplasticity\u2019 (for the relevant terms). This solution is defended by\nDorr et al partly by considering difficulties for rival\nsolutions (including that of Chandler and Salmon). The details are\ncomplex, however: interested readers should consult Dorr et\nal 2021. As with other proposed solutions to the puzzle, the\nprinciples to which Dorr et al appeal (plenitude and semantic\nplasticity for the relevant terms) are controversial.\n\nIt is fair to say that there is no consensus about how the proponent\nof transworld identity should respond to the transitivity problem\nposed by Chandler\u2019s example.\n",
