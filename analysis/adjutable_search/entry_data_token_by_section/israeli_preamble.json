    "main_text": "\n\nIsaac ben Solomon Israeli (ca. 855\u2013955 CE), not to be confused\nwith Isaac Israeli the Younger (an astronomer of Spain, d. 1322 CE),\nserved as physician to the founder of the Fatimid Dynasty in North\nAfrica and wrote several philosophical and medical treatises in Arabic\nwhich were subsequently translated and widely read in Latin and\nHebrew. Israeli was one of the earliest medieval Jewish Neoplatonist\nwriters, though not as original in his thinking as later Jewish\nphilosophers such as Solomon Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Moses Maimonides\nand Gersonides. His work reflected and encapsulated the prevailing\nphilosophical paradigm, namely, Aristotelian thought read through a\nNeoplatonist lens. Israeli\u2019s thought was largely influenced by\nthe Arab philosopher al-Kindi (d. ca. 870 CE) and by available\nNeoplatonist sources, either The Theology of Aristotle or (by\nS. M. Stern\u2019s hypothesis) a pseudepigraphic Neoplatonist\ntreatise (no longer extant in the Arabic original) which was later\ntranslated into Hebrew by Abraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240) and appended to\nthe belles-lettrist work The Prince and the Ascetic. Although\nmuch of his work is paraphrase and commentary on these two sources,\nIsraeli\u2019s thought did include a few divergences from al-Kindi,\nsuch as the idea of the emanation of shadow, and a reversal of the\nprocess of intellection described in al-Kindi\u2019s model.\nIsraeli\u2019s philosophical works were read by several later Jewish\nand Christian authors who occasionally quoted him, sometimes without\nattribution. His medical treatises were widely read and respected by\nphysicians for centuries in Muslim and Christian domains.\n",
