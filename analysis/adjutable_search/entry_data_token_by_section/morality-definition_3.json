Normative Definitions of \u201cMorality\u201d\n\nThose who use \u201cmorality\u201d normatively hold that morality is\n(or would be) the behavioral code that meets the following condition:\nall rational persons, under certain specified conditions, would\nendorse it. Indeed, this is a plausible basic schema for definitions\nof \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense. Although some hold\nthat no code could meet the condition, many theorists hold that there\nis one that does; we can call the former \u201cmoral skeptics\u201d\nand the latter \u201cmoral realists\u201d (see entries on LINK:\nmoral skepticism and moral realism).\n\nMany moral skeptics would reject the claim that there are any\nuniversal ethical truths, where the ethical is a broader category than\nthe moral. But another interesting class of moral skeptics includes\nthose who think that we should only abandon the narrower category of\nthe moral\u2014partly because of the notion of a code that\nis central to that category. These moral skeptics hold that we should\ndo our ethical theorizing in terms of the good life, or the virtues.\nElizabeth Anscombe (1958) gave expression to this kind of view, which\nalso finds echoes in the work of Bernard Williams (1985). On the other\nhand, some virtue theorists might take perfect rationality to entail\nvirtue, and might understand morality to be something like the code\nthat such a person would implicitly endorse by acting in virtuous\nways. In that case, even a virtue theorist might count as a moral\nrealist in the sense above.\n\nConsequentialist views might not seem to fit the basic schema for\ndefinitions of \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense, since\nthey do not appear to make reference to the notions of endorsement or\nrationality. But this appearance is deceptive. Mill himself explicitly\ndefines morality as\n\n\nthe rules and precepts for human conduct, by the observance of which\n[a happy existence] might be, to the greatest extent possible,\nsecured. (1861 [2002: 12])\n\n\nAnd he thinks that the mind is not in a \u201cright state\u201d\nunless it is in \u201cthe state most conducive to the general\nhappiness\u201d\u2014in which case it would certainly favor morality\nas just characterized. And the act-consequentialist J.J.C. Smart\n(1956) is also explicit that he is thinking of ethics as the study of\nhow it is most rational to behave. His embrace of utilitarianism is\nthe result of his belief that maximizing utility is always the\nrational thing to do. On reflection it is not surprising that many\nmoral theorists implicitly hold that the codes they offer would be\nendorsed by all rational people, at least under certain conditions.\nUnless one holds this, one will have to admit that, having been shown\nthat a certain behavior is morally required, a rational person might\nsimply shrug and ask \u201cSo what? What is that to me?\u201d And,\nthough some exceptions are mentioned below, very few moral realists\nthink that their arguments leave this option open. Even fewer think\nthis option remains open if we are allowed to add some additional\nconditions beyond mere rationality: a restriction on beliefs, for\nexample (similar to Rawls\u2019 (1971: 118) veil of ignorance), or\nimpartiality.\n\nDefinitions of morality in the normative sense\u2014and,\nconsequently, moral theories\u2014differ in their accounts of\nrationality, and in their specifications of the conditions under which\nall rational persons would necessarily endorse the code of conduct\nthat therefore would count as morality. These definitions and theories\nalso differ in how they understand what it is to endorse a code in the\nrelevant way. Related to these differences, definitions of\n\u201cmorality\u201d\u2014and moral theories\u2014differ with\nregard to those to whom morality applies: that is, those whose\nbehavior is subject to moral judgment. Some hold that morality applies\nonly to those rational beings that have certain specific features of\nhuman beings: features that make it rational for them to endorse\nmorality. These features might, for example, include fallibility and\nvulnerability. Other moral theories claim to put forward an account of\nmorality that provides a guide to all rational beings, even if these\nbeings do not have these human characteristics, e.g., God.\n\nAmong those who use \u201cmorality\u201d normatively, virtually all\nhold that \u201cmorality\u201d refers to a code of conduct that\napplies to all who can understand it and can govern their\nbehavior by it, though many hold that it protects a larger\ngroup. Among such theorists it is also common to hold that morality\nshould never be overridden. That is, it is common to hold that no one\nshould ever violate a moral prohibition or requirement for non-moral\nreasons. This claim is trivial if \u201cshould\u201d is taken to\nmean \u201cmorally should\u201d. So the claim about moral\noverridingness is typically understood with \u201cshould\u201d\nmeaning \u201crationally should\u201d, with the result that moral\nrequirements are asserted to be rational requirements. Though common,\nthis view is by no means always taken as definitional. Sidgwick (1874)\ndespaired of showing that rationality required us to choose\nmorality over egoism, though he certainly did not think rationality\nrequired egoism either. More explicitly, Gert (2005) held that though\nmoral behavior is always rationally permissible, it is not\nalways rationally required. Foot (1972) seems to have held\nthat any reason\u2014and therefore any rational requirement\u2014to\nact morally would have to stem from a contingent commitment or an\nobjective interest. And she also seems to have held that sometimes\nneither of these sorts of reasons might be available, so that moral\nbehavior might not be rationally required for some agents. Finally,\nmoral realists who hold desire-based theories of reasons and formal,\nmeans/end theories of rationality sometimes explicitly deny that moral\nbehavior is always even rationally permissible (Goldman\n2009), and in fact this seems to be a consequence of Foot\u2019s view\nas well, though she does not emphasize it.\n\nDespite the fact that theorists such as Sidgwick, Gert, Foot, and\nGoldman do not hold that moral behavior is rationally required, they\nare by no means precluded from using \u201cmorality\u201d in the\nnormative sense. Using \u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense,\nand holding that there is such a thing, only entails holding that\nrational people would put a certain system forward; it does not entail\nholding that rational people would always be motivated to follow that\nsystem themselves. But to the degree that a theorist would deny even\nthe claim about endorsement, and hold instead that rational people\nmight not only fail to act morally, but might even reject it as a\npublic system, that theorist is either not using\n\u201cmorality\u201d in a normative sense, or is denying the\nexistence of morality in that sense. Such a theorist may also be using\n\u201cmorality\u201d in a descriptive sense, or may not have any\nparticular sense in mind.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used in its normative sense, it need\nnot have either of the two formal features that are essential to\nmoralities referred to by the descriptive sense: that it be a code of\nconduct that is put forward by a society, group, or individual, or\nthat it be accepted as a guide to behavior by the members of that\nsociety or group, or by that individual. Indeed, it is possible that\nmorality, in the normative sense, has never been put forward by any\nparticular society, by any group at all, or even by any individual.\nThis is partly a consequence of the fact that \u201cmorality\u201d\nin the normative sense is understood in terms of a conditional that is\nlikely to be counterfactual: it is the code that would be endorsed by\nany fully rational person under certain conditions.\n\nIf one is a moral realist, and one also acknowledges the descriptive\nsense of \u201cmorality\u201d, one may require that descriptive\nmoralities at least approximate, in some ways, morality in the\nnormative sense. That is, one might claim that the guides to behavior\nof some societies lack so many of the essential features of morality\nin the normative sense, that it is incorrect to say that these\nsocieties even have a morality in a descriptive sense. This is an\nextreme view, however. A more moderate position would hold that all\nsocieties have something that can be regarded as their morality, but\nthat many of these moralities\u2014perhaps, indeed, all of\nthem\u2014are defective. That is, a moral realist might hold that\nalthough these actual guides to behavior have enough of the features\nof normative morality to be classified as descriptive moralities, they\nwould not be endorsed in their entirety by all moral agents.\n\nWhile moral realists do not claim that any actual society has or has\never had morality as its actual guide to conduct, \u201cnatural\nlaw\u201d theories of morality claim that any rational person in any\nsociety, even one that has a defective morality, is capable of knowing\nwhat general kinds of actions morality prohibits, requires,\ndiscourages, encourages, and allows. In the theological version of\nnatural law theories, such as that put forward by Aquinas, this is\nbecause God implanted this knowledge in the reason of all persons. In\nthe secular version of natural law theories, such as that put forward\nby Hobbes (1660), natural reason is sufficient to allow all rational\npersons to know what morality prohibits, requires, etc. Natural law\ntheorists also claim that morality applies to all rational persons,\nnot only those now living, but also those who lived in the past.\n\nIn contrast to natural law theories, other moral theories do not hold\nquite so strong a view about the universality of knowledge of\nmorality. Still, many hold that morality is known to all who can\nlegitimately be judged by it. Baier (1958), Rawls (1971) and\ncontractarians deny that there can be an esoteric morality:\none that judges people even though they cannot know what it prohibits,\nrequires, etc. For all of the above theorists, morality is what we can\ncall a public system: a system of norms (1) that is knowable\nby all those to whom it applies and (2) that is not irrational for any\nof those to whom it applies to follow (Gert 2005: 10). Moral judgments\nof blame thus differ from legal or religious judgments of blame in\nthat they cannot be made about persons who are legitimately ignorant\nof what they are required to do. Act consequentialists seem to hold\nthat everyone should know that they are morally required to act so as\nto bring about the best consequences, but even they do not seem to\nthink judgments of moral blame are appropriate if a person is\nlegitimately ignorant of what action would bring about the best\nconsequences (Singer 1993: 228). Parallel views seem to be held by\nrule consequentialists (Hooker 2001: 72).\n\nThe ideal situation for a legal system would be that it be a public\nsystem. But in any large society this is not possible. Games are\ncloser to being public systems and most adults playing a game know its\nrules, or they know that there are judges whose interpretation\ndetermines what behavior the game prohibits, requires, etc. Although a\ngame is often a public system, its rules apply only to those playing\nthe game. If a person does not care enough about the game to abide by\nthe rules, she can usually quit. Morality is the one public system\nthat no rational person can quit. The fact that one cannot quit\nmorality means that one can do nothing to escape being legitimately\nliable to sanction for violating its norms, except by ceasing to be a\nmoral agent. Morality applies to people simply by virtue of their\nbeing rational persons who know what morality prohibits, requires,\netc., and being able to guide their behavior accordingly.\n\nPublic systems can be formal or informal. To say a\npublic system is informal is to say that it has no authoritative\njudges and no decision procedure that provides a unique guide to\naction in all situations, or that resolves all disagreements. To say\nthat a public system is formal is to say that it has one or both of\nthese things (Gert 2005: 9). Professional basketball is a formal\npublic system; all the players know that what the referees call a foul\ndetermines what is a foul. Pickup basketball is an informal public\nsystem. The existence of persistent moral disagreements shows that\nmorality is most plausibly regarded as an informal public system. This\nis true even for such moral theories as the Divine Command theory and\nact utilitarianism, inasmuch as there are no authoritative judges of\nGod\u2019s will, or of which act will maximize utility, and there are\nno decision procedures for determining these things (Scanlon 2011:\n261\u20132). When persistent moral disagreement is recognized, those\nwho understand that morality is an informal public system admit that\nhow one should act is morally unresolvable, and if some resolution is\nrequired, the political or legal system can be used to resolve it.\nThese formal systems have the means to provide unique guides, but they\ndo not provide the uniquely correct moral guide to the action that\nshould be performed.\n\nAn important example of a moral problem left unsettled by the informal\npublic system of morality is whether fetuses are impartially protected\nby morality and so whether or under what conditions abortions are\nallowed. There is continuing disagreement among fully informed moral\nagents about this moral question, even though the legal and political\nsystem in the United States has provided fairly clear guidelines about\nthe conditions under which abortion is legally allowed. Despite this\nimportant and controversial issue, morality, like all informal public\nsystems, presupposes agreement on how to act in most moral situations,\ne.g., all agree that killing or seriously harming any moral agent\nrequires strong justification in order to be morally allowed. No one\nthinks it is morally justified to cheat, deceive, injure, or kill a\nmoral agent simply in order to gain sufficient money to take a\nfantastic vacation. Moral matters are often thought to be\ncontroversial because everyday decisions, about which there is no\ncontroversy, are rarely discussed. The amount of agreement concerning\nwhat rules are moral rules, and on when it is justified to violate one\nof these rules, explains why morality can be a public system even\nthough it is an informal system.\n\nBy using the notion of an informal public system, we can improve the\nbasic schema for definitions of \u201cmorality\u201d in the\nnormative sense. The old schema was that morality is the code\nthat all rational persons, under certain specified conditions, would\nendorse. The improved schema is that morality is the informal\npublic system that all rational persons, under certain specified\nconditions, would endorse. Some theorists might not regard the\ninformal nature of the moral system as definitional, holding that\nmorality might give knowable precise answers to every question. This\nwould have the result that conscientious moral agents often cannot\nknow what morality permits, requires, or allows. Some philosophers\ndeny that this is a genuine possibility.\n\nOn any definition of \u201cmorality\u201d, whether descriptive or\nnormative, it is a code of conduct. However, on ethical- or\ngroup-relativist accounts or on individualistic accounts\u2014all of\nwhich are best regarded as accounts of morality in the descriptive\nsense\u2014morality often has no special content that distinguishes\nit from nonmoral codes of conduct, such as law or religion. Just as a\nlegal code of conduct can have almost any content, as long as it is\ncapable of guiding behavior, and a religious code of conduct has no\nlimits on content, most relativist and individualist accounts of\nmorality place few limits on the content of a moral code. Of course,\nactual codes do have certain minimal limits\u2014otherwise the\nsocieties they characterize would lack the minimum required degree of\nsocial cooperation required to sustain their existence over time. On\nthe other hand, for moral realists who explicitly hold that morality\nis an informal public system that all rational persons would put\nforward for governing the behavior of all moral agents, it has a\nfairly definite content. Hobbes (1660), Mill (1861), and most other\nnon-religiously influenced philosophers in the Anglo-American\ntradition limit morality to behavior that, directly or indirectly,\naffects others.\n\nThe claim that morality only governs behavior that affects others is\nsomewhat controversial, and so probably should not be counted as\ndefinitional of morality, even if it turns out to be entailed by the\ncorrect moral theory. Some have claimed that morality also governs\nbehavior that affects only the agent herself, such as taking\nrecreational drugs, masturbation, and not developing one\u2019s\ntalents. Kant (1785) may provide an account of this wide concept of\nmorality. Interpreted this way, Kant\u2019s theory still fits the\nbasic schema, but includes these self-regarding moral requirements\nbecause of the particular account of rationality he employs. However,\npace Kant, it is doubtful that all moral agents would put\nforward a universal guide to behavior that governs behavior that does\nnot affect them at all. Indeed, when the concept of morality is\ncompletely distinguished from religion, moral rules do seem to limit\ntheir content to behavior that directly or indirectly causes or risks\nharm to others. Some behavior that seems to affect only oneself, e.g.,\ntaking recreational drugs, may have a significant indirect harmful\neffect on others by supporting the illegal and harmful activity of\nthose who benefit from the sale of those drugs.\n\nConfusion about the content of morality sometimes arises because\nmorality is not distinguished sufficiently from religion. Regarding\nself-affecting behavior as governed by morality is supported by the\nidea that we are created by God and are obliged to obey God\u2019s\ncommands, and so may be a holdover from the time when morality was not\nclearly distinguished from religion. This religious holdover might\nalso affect the claim that some sexual practices such as homosexuality\nare immoral. Those who clearly distinguish morality from religion\ntypically do not regard sexual orientation as a moral matter.\n\nIt is possible to hold that having a certain sort of social goal is\ndefinitional of morality (Frankena 1963). Stephen Toulmin (1950) took\nit to be the harmony of society. Baier (1958) took it to be \u201cthe\ngood of everyone alike\u201d. Utilitarians sometimes claim it is the\nproduction of the greatest good. Gert (2005) took it to be the\nlessening of evil or harm. This latter goal may seem to be a\nsignificant narrowing of the utilitarian claim, but utilitarians\nalways include the lessening of harm as essential to producing the\ngreatest good and almost all of their examples involve the avoiding or\npreventing of harm. It is notable that the paradigm cases of moral\nrules are those that prohibit causing harm directly or indirectly,\nsuch as rules prohibiting killing, causing pain, deceiving, and\nbreaking promises. Even those precepts that require or encourage\npositive action, such as helping the needy, are almost always related\nto preventing or relieving harms, rather than promoting goods such as\npleasure.\n\nAmong the views of moral realists, differences in content are less\nsignificant than similarities. For all such philosophers, morality\nprohibits actions such as killing, causing pain, deceiving, and\nbreaking promises. For some, morality also requires charitable\nactions, but failure to act charitably on every possible occasion does\nnot require justification in the same way that any act of killing,\ncausing pain, deceiving, and breaking promises requires justification.\nBoth Kant (1785) and Mill (1861) distinguish between duties of perfect\nobligation and duties of imperfect obligation and regard not harming\nas the former kind of duty and helping as the latter kind of duty. For\nGert (2005), morality encourages charitable action, but does not\nrequire it; it is always morally good to be charitable, but it is not\nimmoral not to be charitable.\n\nEven if the plausible basic schema for definitions of\n\u201cmorality\u201d in the normative sense is accepted, one\u2019s\nunderstanding of what morality is, in this sense, will still depend\nvery significantly on how one understands rationality. As has already\nbeen mentioned, morality, in the normative sense, is sometimes taken\nto prohibit certain forms of consensual sexual activity, or the use of\nrecreational drugs. But including such prohibitions in an account of\nmorality as a universal guide that all rational persons would put\nforward requires a very particular view of rationality. After all,\nmany will deny that it is irrational to favor harmless consensual\nsexual activities, or to favor the use of certain drugs for purely\nrecreational purposes.\n\nOne concept of rationality that supports the exclusion of sexual\nmatters, at least at the basic level, from the norms of morality, is\nthat for an action to count as irrational it must be an act that harms\noneself without producing a compensating benefit for\nsomeone\u2014perhaps oneself, perhaps someone else. Such an account\nof rationality might be called \u201chybrid\u201d, since it gives\ndifferent roles to self-interest and to altruism. An account of\nmorality based on the hybrid concept of rationality could agree with\nHobbes (1660) that morality is concerned with promoting people living\ntogether in peace and harmony, which includes obeying the rules\nprohibiting causing harm to others. Although moral prohibitions\nagainst actions that cause harm or significantly increase the risk of\nharm are not absolute, in order to avoid acting immorally,\njustification is always needed when violating these prohibitions. Kant\n(1797) seems to hold that it is never justified to violate some of\nthese prohibitions, e.g., the prohibition against lying. This is\nlargely a result of the fact that Kant\u2019s (1785) concept of\nrationality is purely formal, in contrast with the hybrid concept of\nrationality described above.\n\nMost moral realists who offer moral theories do not bother to offer\nanything like a definition of morality. Instead, what these\nphilosophers offer is a theory of the nature and justification of a\nset of norms with which they take their audience already to be\nacquainted. In effect, they tacitly pick morality out by reference to\ncertain salient and relative uncontroversial bits of its content: that\nit prohibits killing, stealing, deceiving, cheating, and so on. In\nfact, this would not be a bad way of defining morality, if the point\nof such a definition were only to be relatively theory-neutral, and to\nallow theorizing to begin. We could call it \u201cthe\nreference-fixing definition\u201d or \u201cthe substantive\ndefinition\u201d (see Prinz and Nichols 2010: 122).\n\nSome, including Hare (1952, 1963), have been tempted to argue against\nthe possibility of a substantive definition of morality, on the basis\nof the claim that moral disapproval is an attitude that can be\ndirected at anything whatsoever. Foot (1958a, 1958b), argued against\nthis idea, but the substantive definition still has the drawback is\nthat it does not, somehow, seem to get at the essence of morality. One\nmight suggest that the substantive definition has the advantage of\nincluding Divine Command theories of morality, while such theories\nmight seem to make trouble for definitions based on the plausible\nschema given above. But it is plausible to hold that Divine Command\ntheories rest on Natural Law theories, which do in fact fit the\nschema. Divine Command theories that do not rest on Natural Law might\nmake trouble for the schema, but one might also think that such\ntheories rest instead on a confusion, since they seem to entail that\nGod might have made it immoral to act beneficently.\n",
