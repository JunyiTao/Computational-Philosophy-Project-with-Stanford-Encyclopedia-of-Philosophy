Views Opposing the Existence Dimension (III): Expressivism about Morals\n\nWe saw above that for the subject-matter in question the\nerror-theorist agrees with the realist that the truth of the\natomic, declarative sentences of that area requires the existence of\nthe relevant type of objects, or the instantiation of the relevant\nsorts of properties. Although the realist and the error-theorist agree\non this much, they of course disagree on the question of whether the\nrelevant type of objects exist, or on whether the relevant sorts of\nproperties are instantiated: the error-theorist claims that they\ndon\u2019t, so that the atomic, declarative sentences of the area are\nsystematically and uniformly false, the realist claims that at least\nin some instances the relevant objects exist or the relevant\nproperties are instantiated, so that the atomic, declarative sentences\nof the area are at least in some instances true. We also saw that an\nerror-theory about a particular area could be motivated by\nepistemological worries (Field) or by a combination of epistemological\nand metaphysical worries (Mackie).\n\nAnother way in which the existence dimension of realism can be\nresisted is via expressivism. Whereas the realist and the\nerror-theorist agree that the sentences of the relevant area are\ntruth-apt, apt to be assessed in terms of truth and falsity,\nthe realist and the expressivist (alternatively non-cognitivist,\nprojectivist) disagree about the truth-aptness of those sentences. It\nis a fact about English that sentences in the declarative mood\n(\u2018The beer is in the fridge\u2019) are conventionally used for\nmaking assertions, and assertions are true or false depending on\nwhether or not the fact that is asserted to obtain actually obtains.\nBut there are other grammatical moods that are conventionally\nassociated with different types of speech-act. For example, sentences\nin the imperatival mood (\u2018Put the beer in the fridge\u2019) are\nconventionally used for giving orders, and sentences in the\ninterrogative mood (\u2018Is the beer in the fridge?\u2019) are\nconventionally used for asking questions. Note that we would not\nordinarily think of orders or questions as even apt for assessment in\nterms of truth and falsity: they are not truth-apt. Now the\nconventions mentioned here are not exceptionless: for example, one can\nuse sentences in the declarative mood (\u2018My favourite drink is\nBelhaven 60 shilling\u2019) to give an order (for some Belhaven 60\nshilling), one can use sentences in the interrogative mood (\u2018Is\nthe Pope a Catholic?\u2019) to make an assertion (of whatever fact\nwas the subject of the discussion), and so on. The expressivist about\na particular area will claim that the realist is misled by the syntax\nof the sentences of that area into thinking that they are truth-apt:\nshe will say that this is a case where the conventional association of\nthe declarative mood with assertoric force breaks down. In the moral\ncase the expressivist can claim that \u2018Stealing is wrong\u2019\nis no more truth-apt than \u2018Put the beer in the fridge\u2019: it\nis just that the lack of truth-aptness of the latter is worn on its\nsleeve, while the lack of truth-aptness of the former is veiled by its\nsurface syntax.(There are some very important issues concerning the\nrelationship between minimalism about truth-aptitude and expressivism\nthat we cannot go into here. See Divers and Miller (1995)and Miller\n(2013b) for some pointers. There are also some important differences\nbetween e.g. Ayer\u2019s emotivism and more modern forms of\nexpressivism (such as those developed by Blackburn and Gibbard) that\nwe gloss over here. For a useful account, see Schroeder 2009). \n\nSo, if moral sentences are not conventionally used for the making of\nassertions, what are they conventionally used for? According to one\nclassical form of expressivism, emotivism, they are\nconventionally used for the expression of emotion, feeling, or\nsentiment. Thus, A.J. Ayer writes:\n\nIf I say to someone, \u2018You acted wrongly in stealing that\nmoney\u2019, I am not stating anything more than if I had simply\nsaid, \u2018You stole that money\u2019. In adding that this action\nis wrong, I am not making any further statement about it. I am\nsimply evincing my moral disapproval about it. It is as if I had\nsaid, \u2018You stole that money\u2019, in a peculiar tone of\nhorror, or written with the addition of some special exclamation\nmarks. The tone, or the exclamation marks, adds nothing to the literal\nmeaning of the sentence. It merely serves to show that the\nexpression of it is attended by certain feelings in the speaker\n(Ayer 1946: 107, emphases added).\n\n\nIt follows from this that:\n\nIf I now generalise my previous statement and say, \u2018Stealing\nmoney is wrong,\u2019 I produce a sentence which has no factual\nmeaning\u2014that is, expresses no proposition that can be either\ntrue or false (1946: 107).\n\n\nEmotivism faces many problems, discussion of which is not possible\nhere (for a survey, see Miller 2003a Ch.3). One problem that has been\nthe bugbear of all expressivist versions of non-realism, the\n\u2018Frege-Geach Problem\u2019, is so-called because the classic\nmodern formulation is by Peter Geach (1965), who attributes the\noriginal point to Frege.\n\nAccording to emotivism, when I sincerely utter the sentence\n\u2018Murder is wrong\u2019 I am not expressing a belief or making\nan assertion, but rather expressing some non-cognitive sentiment or\nfeeling, incapable of being true or false. Thus, the emotivist claims\nthat in contexts where \u2018is wrong\u2019 is being applied to an\naction-type it is being used to express a sentiment or feeling of\ndisapproval towards actions of that type. But what about contexts in\nwhich it is not being applied to an action type? An example of such a\nsentence would be \u2018If murder is wrong, then getting little\nbrother to murder people is wrong\u2019. In the antecedent of this\n\u2018is wrong\u2019 is clearly not being applied to anything\n(compare: in uttering \u2018If snow is black then it is not\nwhite\u2019 I am not applying \u2018is black\u2019 to snow). So\nwhat account can the emotivist give of the use of \u2018Murder is\nwrong\u2019 within \u2018unasserted contexts\u2019, such as the\nantecedent of the conditional above? Since it is not there used to\nexpress disapproval of murder, the account of its semantic function\nmust be different from that given for the apparently straightforward\nassertion expressed by \u2018Murder is wrong\u2019. But now there is\na problem in accounting for the following valid inference:\n\nMurder is wrong.\nIf Murder is wrong, then getting your little brother to murder\npeople is wrong.\n\nTherefore:\n\nGetting your little brother to murder people is wrong.\n\nIf the semantic function of \u2018is wrong\u2019 as it occurs within\nan asserted context in (1) is different from its semantic function as\nit occurs within an unasserted context in (2), isn\u2019t someone\narguing in this way simply guilty of equivocation? In order for the\nargument to be valid, the occurrence of \u2018Murder is wrong\u2019\nin (1) has to mean the same thing as the occurrence of\n\u2018Murder is wrong\u2019 in (2). But if \u2018is wrong\u2019\nhas a different semantic function in (1) and (2), then it certainly\ndoesn\u2019t mean the same thing in (1) and (2), and so neither do\nthe sentences in which it appears. So the above argument is apparently\nno more valid than:\n\nMy beer has a head on it.\n\nIf my beer has a head on it, then it must have eyes and ears.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nMy beer must have eyes and ears.\n\nThis argument is obviously invalid, because it relies on an\nequivocation on two senses of \u2018head\u2019, in (4) and (5)\nrespectively.\n\nIt is perhaps worth stressing why the Frege-Geach problem\ndoesn\u2019t afflict ethical theories which see \u2018Murder is\nwrong\u2019 as truth-apt, and sincere utterances of \u2018Murder is\nwrong\u2019 as capable of expressing straightforwardly\ntruth-assessable beliefs. According to theories like these, moral\nmodus ponens arguments such as the argument above from (1)\nand (2) to (3) are just like non-moral cases of modus ponens\nsuch as\n\nSmith is in Glasgow;\nIf Smith is in Glasgow then Smith is in Scotland;\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nSmith is in Scotland.\n\nWhy is this non-moral case of modus ponens not similarly\ninvalid in virtue of the fact that \u2018Smith is in Glasgow\u2019\nis asserted in (7), but not in (8)? The answer is of course that the\nstate of affairs asserted to obtain by \u2018Smith is in\nGlasgow\u2019 in (7) is the same as that whose obtaining is merely\nentertained in the antecedent of (8). In (7) \u2018Smith is in\nGlasgow\u2019 is used to assert that a state of affairs obtains\n(Smith\u2019s being in Glasgow), and in (8) it is asserted that if\nthat state of affairs obtains, so does another (Smith\u2019s being in\nScotland). Throughout, the semantic function of the sentences\nconcerned is given in terms of the states of affairs asserted to\nobtain in simple assertoric contexts. And it is difficult to see how\nan emotivist can say anything analogous to this with respect to the\nargument from (1) and (2) to (3): it is difficult to see how the\nsemantic function of \u2018Murder is wrong\u2019 in the antecedent\nof (2) could be given in terms of the sentiment it allegedly expresses\nin (1).\n\nThe Frege-Geach challenge to the emotivist is thus to answer the\nfollowing question: how can you give an emotivist account of the\noccurrence of moral sentences in \u2018unasserted\ncontexts\u2019\u2014such as the antecedents of\nconditionals\u2014without jeopardising the intuitively valid patterns\nof inference in which those sentences figure? Philosophers wishing to\ndevelop an expressivistic alternative to moral realism have expended a\ngreat deal of energy and ingenuity in devising responses to this\nchallenge. See in particular Blackburn\u2019s development of\n\u2018quasi-realism\u2019, in his (1984) Chs 5 and 6, (1993) Ch.10,\n(1998) Ch.3 and Gibbard\u2019s \u2018norm-expressivism\u2019, in\nhis (1990) Ch.5, and further refined in his (2003). For criticism see\nHale (1993) and (2002), and K\u00f6lbel (2002) Ch.4. For an overview,\nsee Schroeder (2008) and Miller (2013a), Chs 4 and 5.
