    "main_text": "Reinterpretations || Multi-Criterial Decision\n6.3 Overall Similarity\nThings are more similar to each other in one respect, less similar\nin another. Much philosophy relies on notions of aggregate or\n\u201coverall\u201d similarity and Arrow\u2019s framework has also been used\nto study these.\nOverall similarity lies at the foundation of David Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics (Lewis 1968, 1973a, 1973b). He wrote little about how\nsimilarities and differences in various respects might go together to\nyield overall similarities, though (Lewis 1979) gives some idea of\nwhat he had in mind. The Arrow-Sen framework lends itself to studying\nthis aggregation problem as well; and an impossibility theorem, if it\napplies, limits the possibilities for arriving at overall similarities\nof the sort that Lewis presupposes. Morreau (2010) presents the case\nthat a variant of Arrow\u2019s theorem does apply. Kroedel and Huber (2013)\ntake a more optimistic view of overall similarity.\nAccording to Popper (1963), some scientific theories, though false,\nare closer to the truth than others. Work on his notion\nof verisimilitude has distinguished \u201clikeness\u201d\nand \u201ccontent\u201d dimensions, and the question arises whether\nthese can be combined into a single ordering of theories by their\noverall verisimilitude. Zwart and Franssen (2007) argue that Arrow\u2019s\ntheorem does not apply to this problem but, using a theorem inspired\nby it, they argue that there is no good way to combine the different\ndimensions even so. See Schurz and Weingartner (2010) and Oddie (2013)\nfor constructive criticism of their views.\n",
