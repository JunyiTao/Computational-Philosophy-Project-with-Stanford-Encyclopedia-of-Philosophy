    "main_text": "\n\nHigher-order evidence is evidence which bears on a believer\u2019s\nrational capacities, epistemic performance, or evidential situation.\nMany epistemologists hold that this kind of evidence can rationally\naffect our \u201cfirst-order\u201d beliefs as well: that is, those\nbeliefs about the world that we form using the relevant rational\ncapacities, or in the relevant evidential situation. It is easiest to\nget a grip on this phenomenon by looking at examples. Here is a\nparadigmatic case (paraphrased from Schoenfield 2018: 690, based on\nsimilar cases put forth by Adam Elga [2013 and 2008\u2014see Other\nInternet Resources], Lasonen-Aarnio [2014], Christensen [2010a], and\nothers):\n\n\nHypoxia: Aisha is out flying her small, unpressurized\nairplane, wondering whether she has enough fuel to make it to Hawaii.\nShe looks at the gauges, dials, and maps, and obtains some evidence,\nE, which she knows strongly supports (say to degree .99)\neither the proposition that she has enough gas (G) or that\nshe does not (~G). Thinking it over and performing the\nnecessary calculations, Aisha concludes G; in fact, this is\nwhat E supports. But then she checks her altitude and notices\nthat she\u2019s at great risk for hypoxia, a condition which impairs\none\u2019s reasoning while leaving the reasoner feeling perfectly\ncogent and clear-headed. Aisha knows that at this altitude, pilots\nperforming the kinds of calculations she just did only reach the\ncorrect conclusion 50% of the time.\n\n\nAisha\u2019s \u201cfirst-order\u201d evidence is her evidence\nbearing directly on her beliefs about G: that is, the\nevidence she receives by consulting her dials, gauges, and maps. Her\n\u201chigher-order\u201d evidence is her evidence suggesting that\nshe\u2019s at risk for hypoxia. Higher-order evidence bears directly\non Aisha\u2019s epistemic situation in various ways, but does not\nbear directly on G. The primary question that this case\nraises, for the higher-order evidence literature, is: does\nAisha\u2019s higher-order evidence also rationally affect\nher beliefs about G? (That is, does it bear on G in\nsome indirect way?)\n\nSome say yes. It would be reckless for Aisha to head out over the\nPacific after realizing that there is such a serious chance that\nshe\u2019s rationally impaired, which surely shows (some argue) that\nshe should not be very confident of G. Others say no. As the\ncase stipulates, Aisha\u2019s first-order evidence strongly supports\nG; whether Aisha is hypoxic has absolutely nothing to do with\nwhether she has enough gas to make it to Hawaii. (Why would her\ntotal evidence prompt her to revise confidence in G,\nwhen the new evidence she has gained is irrelevant to\nG?) Answering \u201cyes\u201d raises questions about\nexactly how and why this level-interaction works. Answering\n\u201cno\u201d raises questions about how to explain the intuitive\nunreasonableness of Aisha\u2019s maintaining high confidence in\nG.\n\nHigher-order evidence thus raises a puzzle. Two apparent features of\nHypoxia are in tension with one another: it seems that Aisha is\nrequired to reduce her confidence in G, and yet it also seems\nthat her evidence still strongly supports G. Some see this as\na conflict between the belief state that seems intuitively rational\n(reduced confidence or suspension of judgment about G) and\nthe belief state that seems strongly supported by her evidence (high\nconfidence in G). Others see it as a conflict within her\nbeliefs. If Aisha maintains high confidence in G, but also\ntakes seriously the possibility that she could be hypoxic, she will be\nin a state of epistemic akrasia: she will have a belief state\n(her high confidence in G) which she also judges likely to be\nirrational, or unsupported by her evidence.\n\nIn what follows we will see these issues crop up in several different\nforms. This article will be organized around a few core questions\nabout higher-order evidence, which will give us different ways to\napproach these central puzzles.\n\nIs higher-order evidence different from ordinary evidence? If so,\nhow?\nWhy might we deny that higher-order evidence has a\nrational effect on first-order beliefs? And if we take that approach,\nwhich problems and questions remain?\nIf higher-order evidence rationally affects first-order beliefs,\nhow does this work? What sort of principle might govern that\ninteraction?\nIs there a way to split the difference, embracing both sides of\nthe puzzle? For example, might there be different, incompatible\nepistemic norms at work in cases like Hypoxia, one telling Aisha to\nbelieve G and another telling her to suspend judgment?\n\n\nA few quick notes before moving on. Following most of the literature,\nthe term \u201chigher-order evidence\u201d is used here, although it\nwould be more accurate to speak of higher-order evidential\neffects or higher-order evidential import (since one\npiece of evidence may be relevant to a person\u2019s beliefs about\nmany different subject matters, in a number of different ways). And\nlike most of the literature, the focus is on higher-order\ndefeat, rather than higher-order confirmation, even\nthough these possibilities go hand in hand. Some of the issues\ndiscussed in this article are discussed in more detail in the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt.\n Finally, although the higher-order evidence debate has its roots in\nthe literature on disagreement, this entry focuses on the simpler,\nsingle-person case introduced above and mostly omits disagreement.\n",
