    "main_text": "Empirical Findings || Comparative Psychology\n3.1 Comparative Psychology\n\nAn important topic that has been hotly investigated is whether FP is\nan exclusively human ability or one shared with other non-human animal\nspecies. Empirical studies investigating ToM capacities have been\nconducted with many species, including bottlenose dolphins,\ncorvids\u2014ravens, scrub jays\u2014and dogs (Dally, Emery &\nClayton 2006; Tomonaga et al. 2010, Bugnyar & Heinrich 2006;\nBugnyar, Reber, & Buckner 2016; Whiten 2013; Maginnity & Grace\n2014; see Lurz (2011) for a book-length overview of mindreading in\nanimals). The most sustained experimental work on animal FP capacities\nhas centered on the social intelligence of non-human primates. In\n1978, when the debate was just kicking off, Premack and Woodruff\nlaunched a small industry by asking in their seminal paper,\n\u201cDoes the Chimpanzee have a theory of mind?\u201d.\n\nEarly assessments gleaned from anecdotes of the behaviors of\nindividual animals seemed to return a positive answer to the titular\nquestion (Byrne & Whiten 1991). Subsequent, more controlled,\nexperiments raised questions about that verdict. In naturalistic\nsettings, non-human great apes exhibit impressive social intelligence\n(Byrne & Whiten 1997, Suddendorf & Whiten 2003). Despite this,\nexperimental findings are equivocal about whether, to what extent, and\nin what ways they are aware of other minds. Initially, there was only\nnegative evidence that chimpanzees and orangutans understand the\nconcept of belief, even when tested by simplified non-verbal versions\nof the \u201clocation change\u201d false belief tasks (Povinelli\n& Eddy 1996; Povinelli 1996, 2003; Call & Tomasello 1999; Penn\n& Povinelli 2007).\n\nSwitching from a cooperative to a competitive design in their task\nprotocols marked a turning point in the field (Hare, Call, &\nTomasello 2001). This change of testing regime yielded evidence that\napes may be aware of simpler mental states other than beliefs, such as\nseeing. Even so, that evidence is equivocal: the results are\n\u201cdecidedly mixed\u201d (Call & Tomasello 2005: 61). A safer\nconclusion at this stage of inquiry is that simian capacities for\nengaging with other minds exhibit signature profiles that differ in\nimportant respects from that of adult human beings, and even that of\nhuman infants.\n\nThe dismal performance of chimpanzees on the standard human variants\nof non-verbal false belief tasks\u2014which test the subject\u2019s\ncapacity to understand that beliefs can be false\u2014galvanized a\nwidespread agreement that the social cognition of great apes does not\ndepend on a sophisticated capacity for FP, certainly not one based on\ntheir having an understanding of belief and inter-relations between\nthat concept and other canonical mental states.\n\nCall and Tomasello (2008) highlight this fact when revisiting Premack\nand Woodruff\u2019s big question 30 years later. Concluding their\nreview of the field, these authors tell us that while the evidence\nsuggests that, in many respects, chimpanzees do have some grip on\nother minds in many other respects, it also tells us that they do not.\nComparing the test results for apes with those of human children has\nall but secured the conviction that if apes do have any FP abilities\nthen they are not of the same form or in the same degree as that of\nhumans.\n\nThe live issue today is not whether chimpanzees or other non-human\nanimals make use of a fully developed FP, but whether they have any\ndegree of mindreading ability at all. Ethologists and primatologists\nhave shifted their focus in this new direction. The main questions now\noccupying the field are: How do apes and other non-human animals\nmanage their sophisticated social interactions without the capacity\nfor full-blown human-style FP understanding? And, if so, what form\ndoes their everyday grip on other minds take?\n\nThe gap between evidence and theory generates a logical problem in the\ninterpretation of empirical data which poses, some argue, an\ninsurmountable challenge for anyone hoping to establish the truth of\nTT based on empirical findings (Whiten 1996; Povinelli & Vonk\n2003; Lurz 2009, 2011; Buckner 2014). This problem arises because\nthere is always logical room for characterizing and explaining\nevidence concerning FP capacities in deflationary non-TT terms. The\nlogical problem reminds us that positing ToMs\u2014of whatever number\nand type\u2014is not the only live theoretical option for\ncharacterizing or explaining the relevant empirical data.\n\nNot everyone is pessimistic about overcoming the logical problem by\npurely empirical means. Heyes (1998) suggested this might be done by\nfinding evidence of subjects projecting first-person experiences onto\nothers. Some researchers find this protocol promising and seek to\ndevelop it (see Southgate 2013, Kano et al. 2019; Lurz & Krachun\n2019).\n\nThere is now a range of proposals about how best to characterize the\napparently FP abilities of non-human apes and other animals. Within\nthe TT camp\u2014the axiomatic assumption is that an everyday\nunderstanding of minds essentially involves attributing mental states\nby employing some kind of ToM. It is accepted, however, that the ToMs\nin question need not be identical to the fully-fledged version of FP\nused by adult humans. Under the TT umbrella, it has been proposed that\nnon-human animals may be using a na\u00efve, weak, or minimal theory\nof mind (Bogdan 2009; Apperly & Butterfill 2009); perceptual\nmindreading (Berm\u00fadez 2011); or an early mindreading system\n(Nichols & Stich 2003). Others favor the idea that animals only\nsimulate the effects of mindreading. It has been proposed that certain\nfeats of social cognition might be variously carried off by a\nsophisticated theory of, or special sensitivities to, behavior\n(Povinelli & Vonk 2004, Gallagher & Povinelli 2012);\nsub-mentalizing that utilizes domain-general non-ToM processes (Heyes\n2018, though see Kano et al. 2017 for a challenge); mind-minding\nabilities that target but do not attribute mental states or contents\n(Fenici 2013, 2015, 2017; Hutto 2017; see Hutto, Herschbach, &\nSouthgate 2011 for a discussion of non-mindreading proposals). Another\ninteresting possibility is that non-human animals, like human children\nand adults, could be using a much more diverse mix of strategies and\ntactics to enable their everyday understanding of minds than imagined\nby FP traditionalists (see\n section 4.4).\n",
