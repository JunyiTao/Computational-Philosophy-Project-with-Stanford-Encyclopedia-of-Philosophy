    "main_text": "Descartes || The Nature of Motion\n3.1 The Nature of Motion\n\nThe identification of space and matter poses a puzzle about motion: if\nthe space that a body occupies literally is the matter of the body,\nthen when the body \u2013 i.e., the matter \u2013 moves, so does the\nspace that it occupies. Thus it doesn\u2019t change place, which is\nto say that it doesn\u2019t move after all! Descartes resolved this\ndifficulty by taking all motion to be the motion of bodies relative to\none another, not a literal change of space.\n\nNow, a body has as many relative motions as there are bodies, but it\ndoes not follow that all are equally significant. Indeed, Descartes\nuses several different concepts of relational motion. First there is\n\u2018change of place\u2019, which is nothing but motion relative to\nthis or that arbitrary reference body (II.13). In this sense no motion\nof a body is privileged, since the speed, direction, and even curve of\na trajectory depends on the reference body, and none is singled out.\nNext, he discusses motion in \u2018the ordinary sense\u2019 (II.24).\nThis is often conflated with mere change of arbitrary place, but\nstrictly it differs because according to the rules of ordinary speech\none correctly attributes motion only to bodies whose motion is caused\nby some action, not to arbitrary relative motion. (For\ninstance, a person sitting on a speeding boat is ordinarily said to be\nat rest, since \u2018he feels no action in himself\u2019.) This\ndistinction is important in some passages, but arguably not in those\nthat we discuss. Finally, he defined motion \u2018properly\nspeaking\u2019 (II.25) to be \u2018the transference of one part of\nmatter or of one body, from the vicinity of those bodies immediately\ncontiguous to it and considered as at rest, into the vicinity of\n[some]\n others.\u2019[2]\n Since a body can only be touching one set of surroundings, Descartes\nargued (questionably) that this standard of motion was unique.\n\nWhat we see here is that Descartes, despite holding motion to be the\nmotion of bodies relative to one another, also held there to be a\nprivileged sense of motion; in a terminology sometimes employed by\nwriters of the period (see Rynasiewicz 2019, \u00a73), he held there\nto be a sense of \u2018true motion\u2019, over and above the merely\nrelative motions. In logical terms we can make the point this way:\nwhile moves-relative-to is a two-place predicate,\nmoves-properly-speaking is a one-place predicate. (And this,\neven though it is defined in terms of relative motion: let\ncontiguous-surroundings be a function from bodies to their\ncontiguous surroundings, then x\nmoves-properly-speaking is defined as x\nmoves-relative-to-contiguous-surroundings(x).)\n\nThis example illustrates why it is crucial to keep two questions\ndistinct: on the one hand, is motion to be understood in terms of\nrelations between bodies or by invoking something additional,\nsomething absolute; on the other hand, are all relative motions\nequally significant, or is there some \u2018true\u2019, privileged\nnotion of motion? Descartes\u2019 views show that eschewing absolute\nmotion is logically compatible with accepting true motion; which is of\ncourse not to say that his definitions of motion are themselves\ntenable.\n",
