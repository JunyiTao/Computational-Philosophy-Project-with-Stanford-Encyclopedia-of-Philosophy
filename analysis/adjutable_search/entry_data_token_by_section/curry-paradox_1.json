    "main_text": "Introduction: Two Guises of the Paradox || A Constraint on Theories\n1.2 A Constraint on Theories\n\nOne challenge posed by Curry\u2019s paradox is to pinpoint what goes\nwrong in the foregoing informal argument for\n (P),\n (Q) or the like. But starting with Curry\u2019s initial\npresentation in Curry 1942b (see the supplementary document on \n Curry on Curry\u2019s Paradox), discussion\nof Curry\u2019s paradox has usually had a different focus. It has\nconcerned various formal systems \u2014most often set theories or\ntheories of truth. In this setting what poses the paradox is a proof\nthat the system has a particular feature. Typically, the feature at\nissue is triviality. A theory is said to be trivial, or\nabsolutely inconsistent, when it affirms every claim that is\nexpressible in the language of the\n theory.[2]\n\n\nAn argument establishing that a particular formal theory is trivial\nwill pose a problem if either of the following is the case: (i) we\nwish to use the formal theory in our inquiries, as we use set theory\nwhen doing mathematics, or (ii) we wish to use the formal theory in\norder to model features of language or thought, in particular the\nclaims to which some speakers or thinkers are committed. Either way,\nthe target theory\u2019s triviality would show that it is inadequate\nfor its intended purpose. So this is a second challenge posed by\nCurry\u2019s paradox.\n\nTo spell out the sense in which Curry\u2019s paradox constrains\ntheories we need to say what a Curry sentence is. Informally,\na Curry sentence is a sentence that is equivalent, by the lights of\nsome theory, to a conditional with itself as antecedent. For\nexample, one might think of the argument of\n section 1.1\n as appealing to an informal theory of truth. Then the sentence\n\u201c\\(k\\) is true\u201d serves as a Curry sentence for that\ntheory. That is because, given what our informal theory tells us about\nwhat \\(k\\)\u2019s truth involves, \u201c\\(k\\) is true\u201d should\nbe equivalent to \u201cIf \\(k\\) is true, then time is infinite\u201d\n(since this conditional is \\(k\\) itself).\n\nIn what follows, the notation \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used\nto say that theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) contains sentence \\(\\alpha\\), and\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used to say that \\(\\alpha\\)\nfollows from the premises collected in \\(\\Gamma\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) (i.e., according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)\u2019s\nconsequence relation\n \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\\)).[3]\n Except in\n section 4.2.1,\n however, we will be concerned only with claims about what follows\naccording to the theory from a single premise, i.e., claims expressed by \nsentences of form\n\\(\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\). (We rely on context to make clear \nwhere such a sentence is being used and where it is only being mentioned.)\n\nTwo sentences (in the language\nof theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) will be called intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided the truth of any claim of the\nform \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is unaffected by\nsubstitutions of one for the other within \\(\\alpha\\) or within any of\nthe sentences in \\(\\Gamma\\). Finally, we assume that the language\ncontains a connective \\({\\rightarrow}\\) that serves, in some suitable\nsense, as a conditional. For purposes of the following definition, we\ndon\u2019t place any specific requirements on the behavior of this\nconditional. We can now define the notion of a Curry sentence for\na sentence-theory pair.\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Curry sentence) Let \\(\\pi\\) be a\nsentence of the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). A Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is any sentence \\(\\kappa\\) such that\n\\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\kappa {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[4]\n\n\nThe various versions of Curry\u2019s paradox arise from the existence\nof arguments in favor of the following very general claim. (These\narguments, which rest on assumptions about the conditional\n\\({\\rightarrow}\\), will be discussed in detail in\n section 3.)\n\n\nTroubling Claim For every theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), and\nany sentence \\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), if there is a\nCurry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\).\n\n\nAn argument that appears to establish the Troubling Claim will count\nas paradoxical provided there is also compelling reason to believe\nthat this claim is false. A counterexample to the Troubling Claim\nwould be any theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and sentence \\(\\pi\\) such that\nthere is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) but it is\nnot the case that \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\).\n\nAs noted above, Curry\u2019s paradox is often understood as a\nchallenge to the existence of nontrivial theories. Given the Troubling\nClaim, a theory will be trivial whenever a Curry sentence can be\nformulated for any sentence in the language of the theory.\nIndeed, triviality follows from a weaker condition, which the\nfollowing definition makes explicit.\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Curry-complete theory) A theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is Curry-complete provided that for every sentence\n\\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), there is some \\(\\pi'\\)\nsuch that (i) there is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi'\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) if \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi'\\) then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\).\n\n\nWhile one instance of \\(\\pi'\\) satisfying the condition (ii) would be\n\\(\\pi\\) itself, another instance would be an \u201cexplosive\u201d\nsentence \\(\\bot\\) that is contained in a theory only if every\nsentence is contained in the\n theory.[5]\n\n\nThe Troubling Claim now has an immediate consequence: a Curry-complete\ntheory must contain every sentence in its language.\n\n\nTroubling Corollary Every Curry-complete theory is\ntrivial.\n\n\nAgain, any argument that appears to establish the Troubling Corollary\nwill count as paradoxical provided that there is compelling reason to\nbelieve that there are nontrivial theories (indeed true theories) that are\nCurry-complete.\n",
