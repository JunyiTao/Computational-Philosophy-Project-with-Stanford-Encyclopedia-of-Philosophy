The question\nof pornography and censorship has divided feminists, just as it has\nbegun to divide liberals. Some feminists argue that pornography is an\nimportant form of sexual expression that does not harm women and may\neven benefit them by liberating women and women\u2019s sexuality from the\noppressive shackles of tradition and sexual conservatism. Pornography,\non this view, is an important tool for exploring and expressing new or\nminority forms of female sexuality. Far from making downtrodden victims\nof women, pornography may have a vital role to play in challenging\ntraditional views about femininity and female sexuality and in\nempowering women, both homosexual and heterosexual, to shape their own\nidentities as sexual beings. (Note that material that benefits women\nought to count as erotica, rather than pornography, on MacKinnon\u2019s\ndefinition. So, as noted in section 1, if there is substantive\ndisagreement between \u201cpro-pornography\u201d feminists and\nMacKinnon here, it will be about whether there really is any sexually\nexplicit material that is beneficial).\n\nThere are also a significant number of feminists who object to\npornography, or to certain forms of it, on the grounds that it harms\nwomen, but who do not think that regulating or banning it is the most\ndesirable or effective way to remedy the harms that pornography causes.\nThese feminists, though not always liberals, nonetheless share some\ngeneral liberal concerns about using the \u201cblunt and\ntreacherous\u201d instrument of the law in the quest to redress harms,\nespecially in light of the way in which the law has frequently been\nused to oppress women, or where laws enacted with the best of\nintentions have nonetheless had this unintended effect. Censorship,\nthey think, may well cause more harm to women than it removes. They\nrecommend more speech \u2013 education, protest, picketing, satire\nand public debate \u2013 rather than censorship or other forms of legal\nregulation as less dangerous and more effective tools for raising\npublic consciousness and effecting the desired attitudinal and cultural\nchange. These feminists are anti-pornography (in the sense that they\nthink material that degrades women is objectionable), but they are also\nanti-censorship.\n\nIndeed, eighty individual feminists, along with the Feminist\nAnti-Censorship Taskforce (F.A.C.T.) and the Women\u2019s Legal Defense\nFund, presented an Amici Brief to the Hudnut court\noutlining a range of feminist concerns about the anti-pornography\nlegislation proposed by MacKinnon and Dworkin (Hunter and Law 1985).\nThese included concerns about the political dangers of feminists\naligning themselves with the conservative, evangelical right; the\npossibility of the legislation discriminating against minority forms of\nsexuality (e.g., lesbianism); interference with women\u2019s freedom to\nchoose to produce and perform in pornography; perpetuating traditional\nideas that sex is bad for women; and diverting attention and resources\naway from more important immediate efforts to bring an end to violence\nagainst women.\n",
