    "main_text": "Gongsun Long || \u201cWhite Horse is Not Horse\u201d\n6.1 \u201cWhite Horse is Not Horse\u201d\n\nThe \u201cWhite Horse Discourse\u201d has spawned nearly as many\ninterpretations as there are interpreters. One early, influential\ninterpretation took its theme to be denying the identity of the\nuniversals \u2018horse\u2019 and \u2018white horse\u2019 (Fung\n1958, Cheng 1983). There is now a fairly broad consensus, at least\namong European and American scholars, that the text is unlikely to\nconcern universals, since no ancient Chinese philosopher held a\nrealist doctrine of universals. Other interpretations have taken it to\ndeal with kind and identity relations (Cikoski 1975, Harbsmeier 1998),\npart-whole relations (Hansen 1983, Graham 1989), how the extensions of\nphrases vary from those of their constituent terms (Hansen 1992), and\neven the use/mention distinction (Thompson 1995). For examples of\nother recent approaches, see Indraccolo (2017), Fung (2020b), Jiang\n(2020), and Zhou (2020).\n\nA satisfactory interpretation must fit into the discursive context\nestablished by the Mohists, Xunzi, and The Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei, cohere with the concerns we identified in discussing the\nbackground\n (Section 1)\n and main themes\n (Section 2)\n of the disputers\u2019 inquiries, and take into account what other\nearly texts tell us about Gongsun Long. Since we know he was an\nintellectual prankster, we cannot assume the texts will present cogent\narguments for a well-reasoned philosophical position. If we find them\npresenting plainly intelligible but specious arguments, we should take\nthese at face value, rather than seek esoteric explanations. Given the\ncontext of pre-Han thought, we should expect the text to toy with the\nproblem of distinguishing \u201csame\u201d from\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d potentially touching on identity, part-whole,\nand kind relations. And given the disputers\u2019 association with\nthe theme of \u201chard and white,\u201d we should expect that the\ntext might attempt to treat inseparable features of things as if they\nwere separable parts. A number of interpretations have the potential\nto meet these requirements, including interpretations involving\npart-whole relations, scope ambiguity, kind relations, and identity\nrelations. To decide between them, then, we need to look at the\ndetails of the text. \u201cWhite Horse\u201d contains five arguments\nfor its thesis that \u201cWhite horse is not horse.\u201d We may\nfind that some interpretive approaches work better for some of the\nfive, some for others. \n\nOne further anecdote about Gongsun Long\u2014found in two texts from\nlater eras, the introductory chapter of the Gongsun Longzi\nand the Kong Congzi\u2014provides useful context for the\ndialogue. In response to a request from Kong Chuan that he abandon his\nthesis that a white horse is not a horse, Gongsun Long defends it by\nclaiming that Confucius himself accepted the same thesis. He cites a\nversion of a story also found in the The Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei (1.4), in which the King of Chu loses his bow.\n\nThe King\u2019s attendants asked to look for it, but the King said,\n\u201cStop. The King of Chu lost a bow. A Chu person will find it.\nWhy bother to look for it?\u201d Confucius heard about it and said:\n\u201cThe King of Chu is benevolent and righteous but hasn\u2019t\nyet reached the ultimate. He should simply have said, \u2018A person\nlost a bow, a person will find it,\u2019 that\u2019s all. Why must\nit be \u2018Chu\u2019?\u201d In this way, Confucius took Chu people\nto be different from what\u2019s called \u201cpeople.\u201d Now to\napprove of Confucius\u2019s taking Chu people to be different from\nwhat\u2019s called \u201cpeople\u201d but disapprove of my taking\nwhite horse to be different from what\u2019s called\n\u201chorse\u201d is contradictory. (Gongsun Longzi, Book\n 1)[18]\n\n\nIn one version of the story, Kong Chuan replies that when Confucius\nomits the \u2018Chu\u2019, he is broadening the scope of the\nreferent, not claiming that Chu people are not people. \n\nWhenever we say \u201cperson,\u201d we refer to persons in general,\njust as whenever we say \u201chorse,\u201d we refer to horses in\ngeneral. \u2018Chu\u2019 by itself is the state; \u2018white\u2019\nby itself is the color. Wishing to broaden the referent of\n\u2018person\u2019, it\u2019s appropriate to omit the\n\u2018Chu\u2019; wishing to fix the name of the color, it\u2019s\nnot appropriate to omit the \u2018white\u2019. (Kong\nCongzi, Book 11; cf. Graham 1989: 84)\n\n\nAs Harbsmeier points out (302), since this story appears in the\nintroduction to the Gongsun Longzi, it suggests that the\nbook\u2019s ancient editors themselves took the theme to be how the\nscope of the extension of a noun such as \u2018person\u2019 or\n\u2018horse\u2019 varies when modified by an adjective such as\n\u2018Chu\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019. The main theme is unlikely\nto be part-whole relations, since it is unlikely that the noun phrase\n\u2018Chu person\u2019 was construed as referring to a whole\ncomprising two parts, the state of Chu and a person. \n\nThis preparatory discussion in hand, let\u2019s look at the arguments\nin the \u201cWhite Horse Discourse.\u201d The text consists of a\nseries of exchanges between a sophist and an objector, who defends the\ncommonsense view that white horses are horses. For brevity, we will\ntranslate and discuss only the sophist\u2019s arguments, not the\nobjector\u2019s. To capture the flavor of the Chinese, we will render\ncertain phrases in pidgin English, omitting articles and plurals. So\nwe will translate the main thesis as \u201cWhite horse is not\nhorse,\u201d variously interpretable as \u201ca white horse is not a\nhorse,\u201d \u201cwhite horses are not horses,\u201d \u201ca\nwhite horse is not an exemplar of the kind horse,\u201d or\n\u201cthe kind white horse is not identical with the kind\n horse.\u201d[19]\n\n\nArgument 1.\n\n\u2018Horse\u2019 is that by which we name the shape.\n\u2018White\u2019 is that by which we name the color. Naming the\ncolor is not naming the shape. So white horse is not horse.\n\n\nAt first glance, it is not at all clear how the premises are expected\nto support the conclusion. Here we should recall that the argument is\nprobably intended to be perplexing and open to various\ninterpretations, the better to confuse and mystify the audience. With\nthis caveat in mind, one plausible reading is that \u2018white\nhorse\u2019 names both the color and the shape of white horses, not\nonly the shape. So \u2018white horse\u2019 names something different\nfrom what \u2018horse\u2019 names. Hence white horse, the extension\nof \u2018white horse\u2019, is not the same as (identical to) horse,\nthe extension of \u2018horse\u2019.\n\nThis argument can also be understood as \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite,\u201d in that the shape and color of white horses, which are\nin fact inseparable, are treated as two separate things. If we grant\nthe sophist that naming the color isn\u2019t naming the shape, we\nhave already allowed him to separate shape from color. Referring to\nthe color is of course different from referring to the shape. But\nnaming the object with the color is just naming the object with the\nshape. Hence we should reject the third premise and insist that naming\nthe color is naming the\n shape.[20]\n\nArgument 2.\n\nIf someone seeks a horse, then it\u2019s admissible to deliver a\nbrown or a black horse. If someone seeks a white horse, then\nit\u2019s inadmissible to deliver a brown or a black horse. Suppose\nwhite horse were indeed horse. In that case, what the person seeks in\nthose two cases would be one and the same. What he seeks being one and\nthe same is the white one not being different from horse. If what he\nseeks is not different, then how is it that the brown or black horse\nare in the one case admissible and in the other inadmissible?\nAdmissible and inadmissible, that they contradict each other is clear.\nSo brown and black horses are one and the same in being able to answer\nto \u201chaving horse\u201d but not to \u201chaving white\nhorse.\u201d This confirms that white horse is not horse.\n\n\nThis argument is fairly clearly not about part-whole relations, nor\nabout separating hard from white. The sophist plainly construes\n\u201cwhite horse is horse\u201d as \u201cwhite horse is identical\nto horse.\u201d In Chinese as in English, the sentence \u2018White\nhorses are horses\u2019 can be interpreted as predicating\n\u2018horse\u2019 of white horses, making the true claim that the\nthings picked out by \u2018white horse\u2019 are all among those\npicked out by \u2018horse\u2019, or it can be interpreted as\nexpressing an identity, making the false claim that exactly the same\nthings are picked out by \u2018white horse\u2019 as by\n\u2018horse\u2019. The argument trades on this ambiguity. Because we\nknow that modifying a noun narrows the scope of its extension, when we\nhear \u201cwhite horses are horses,\u201d we naturally apply the\nprinciple of charity, assume the speaker is not saying something\nobviously false, and take the relation in question to be predication,\nnot identity. But the sophist insists on interpreting the sentence as\nan identity. Notice that the sophist implicitly applies a principle\nroughly like Leibniz\u2019s law of indiscernibility of identicals. He\nassumes that if two things are identical, they will share all their\nfeatures, and one can be substituted for the other in any context.\nSince what can be \u201cdelivered\u201d in answer to a request for\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d is different from what can be\n\u201cdelivered\u201d for \u201chorse,\u201d white horse is not\n horse.[21]\n\nArgument 3.\n\nHorses indeed have color; thus there are white horses. Supposing\nhorses had no color, and there were simply horses and that\u2019s\nall, how could we pick out the white horses? So white is not horse.\nWhite horse is horse combined with white. Is horse combined with white\nthe same as\n horse?[22]\n So I say: White horse is not horse.\n\n\n\u201cWhite\u201d is not \u201chorse\u201d because\n\u2018horse\u2019 alone doesn\u2019t pick out the white ones; only\n\u2018white\u2019 does. The sophist takes it as obvious that\n\u201chorse\u201d combined with \u201cwhite\u201d is not simply\n\u201chorse.\u201d Here he is \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite,\u201d in that he explicitly treats \u201cwhite\u201d and\n\u201chorse\u201d (that is, the shape of the animal) as two things\nthat are combined to form something more than, and different from, a\nhorse. The argument again turns on construing \u201cWhite horse is\nhorse\u201d as the claim that the kind white horse is\nidentical to the kind horse.\n\nArgument 4.\n\n\u201cSince you take having white horse to be having horse, we can\nsay having horse is having brown horse, is that admissible?\u201d\n\u201cNot admissible.\u201d \u201cTaking having horse to be\ndifferent from having brown horse, this is taking brown horse to be\ndifferent from horse. Taking brown horse to be different from horse,\nthis is taking brown horse to be not horse. Taking brown horse to be\nnot horse while taking white horse to be having horse, this is flying\nthings entering a pond, inner and outer coffins in different places.\nThese are the most contradictory sayings and confused expressions in\nthe world.\u201d\n\n\nHere again the argument is based on construing \u201cWhite/brown\nhorse is horse\u201d as an identity claim. Recall that in early\nChinese thought the same/different relation may refer to either\nidentity or kind relations. Moreover, in classical Chinese, both types\nof relations are expressed in the same syntactic form, the Chinese\nanalogue of \u2018A is (not) B\u2019. So when the\ncontext is unambiguous, it is perfectly legitimate to express the fact\nthat A is different from B by saying\n\u201cA is not B.\u201d Taking advantage of this\ngrammatical feature, the sophist can move legitimately from the\nuncontroversial claim that having a horse is different from (that is,\nnot identical to) having a brown horse to the intermediate claim that\nbrown horse is different from (not identical to) horse and then not so\nlegitimately to the conclusion that brown horse is not horse. The\nconclusion indeed follows, but only if we allow the sophist to\nconstrue \u201cis not\u201d as \u201cis not identical to.\u201d\nNotice that this argument seems to involve neither part-whole\nrelations nor separating hard from white (that is, shape from color).\nAnalogy plays a central role, however, as the argument is based on the\nanalogy between brown and white horses. \n\nThe rhetorical flourish at the end of the argument is typical of\nWarring States disputation. To emphasize that a claim is inconsistent\nor contradictory, disputers would habitually cite contradictory or\nimpossible things as analogies (Leslie 1964). \n\nArgument 5.\n\n\u201cWhite\u201d does not fix what is white.\u2026 As to\n\u201cwhite horse,\u201d saying it fixes what is white. What fixes\nwhat is white is not white. \u201cHorse\u201d selects or excludes\nnone of the colors, so brown or black horses can all answer.\n\u201cWhite horse\u201d selects some color and excludes others;\nbrown and black horses are all excluded on the basis of color, and so\nonly white horse alone can answer. Excluding none is not excluding\nsome. Therefore white horse is not horse.\n\n\nThe sophist first \u201cseparates hard and white,\u201d establishing\nthat the shape \u201chorse\u201d is not the same thing as the color\n\u201cwhite.\u201d The color alone does not specify the location\nthat is white; saying \u201cwhite horse\u201d does. Therefore horse,\nthe shape, is not white, the color. Indeed, horse specifies no color\nat all. White horse, on the other hand, does specify a color. So again\nthe sophist has shown that white horse and horse have distinct\nfeatures. Thus white horse is not (identical to) horse. \n\nTo sum up, the most natural way to read the text is as repeatedly\nequivocating between a statement of identity and one that predicates a\nmore general term of the objects denoted by a less general term. The\nsophist refuses to distinguish the true statement that \u201c[the\nkind] white horse is not [identical to the kind] horse\u201d from the\nfalse \u201cwhite horse is not [of the kind] horse.\u201d The\nnatural way to interpret \u201cWhite horse is horse\u201d is as the\nlatter, but the sophist insists on interpreting it as the former. In a\nfew places, the sophist distinguishes the shape of the horse from the\ncolor in a way that probably corresponds to \u201cseparating hard and\nwhite.\u201d \n\nA related explanation of the sophist\u2019s view is that he confuses\nterms that refer at different levels of generality, or, equivalently,\nsimply refuses to recognize that terms can refer at different levels\nof generality. Xunzi, whose career largely overlapped with Gongsun\nLong\u2019s, introduced the concept of a \u201ccommon name\u201d\n(gong ming), or general term, which may refer to things at\ndifferent levels of generality (22.2f). Xunzi pointed out that\nsometimes we refer to things by a single name, such as\n\u2018horse\u2019, and sometimes, to communicate more precisely, we\nuse a \u201ccompound\u201d name (what we would think of as a noun\nphrase), such as \u2018white horse\u2019. Provided one of these two\nkinds of names is more general, we can use both without their\ninterfering with each other. This is roughly the same point Kong Chuan\nmade in insisting that \u2018horse\u2019 always refers to all horses\nand that adding \u2018white\u2019 to it merely narrows its reference\nby specifying the horses\u2019 color. In each case, the animals\ndenoted by \u2018horse\u2019 are still horses. \u201cWhite\nHorse\u201d deliberately ignores this point. \n\nHansen (1983, 1992) has proposed an interesting account of the\nphilosophical significance of the \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue.\nThe simplest early Chinese model of the language-world relation was\n\u201cone name, one thing,\u201d according to which all names refer\nat the same level of generality. Given the Chinese concern with\n\u201ccorrecting names,\u201d so that communication can proceed\neffectively and language can guide action reliably, a natural view\nwould be that ideally each name or phrase should consistently denote\none and only one sort of thing. But as the Mohists noticed, when names\nare joined to form phrases, their reference may shift in unexpected\nways. In Chinese, the phrases \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (niu\nma) and \u2018white horse\u2019 (bai ma) appear to\nhave the same syntax. But in compounds of the first type, the\nextension of the component nouns remains exactly the same as when the\nnouns are used singly: the extension of \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019\nis simply the sum of the extensions of \u2018oxen\u2019 and\n\u2018horses\u2019. In compounds of the second type\u2014the\n\u201cas hard to white\u201d type\u2014on the other hand, the\nextension of the component words changes. The extension of\n\u2018white horse\u2019 is the intersection, not the sum, of white\nthings and horses. The extension of the words \u2018white\u2019 and\n\u2018horse\u2019 as used in the compound is thus different from\nwhat it is when they are used alone. This raises a serious problem for\nthe one-name-one-thing view. The Mohists discovered the problem and\ntook steps toward a solution. Xunzi finally solved it by explicitly\nrejecting the one-name-one-thing principle and recognizing that terms\nrefer at different levels of generality. The approach implied by\n\u201cWhite Horse,\u201d Hansen suggests, would address the problem\nby retaining the one-name-one-thing principle and reforming our\nlanguage use, so that all names pick out exactly the same portion of\nreality in all contexts, whether used singly or compounded into\nphrases. Since the extension of names changes when they are combined\nto form compounds of the \u201cas hard to white\u201d type, a\nproponent of this view must insist that the objects denoted by such\ncompounds be treated as distinct from the objects denoted by either of\ntheir constituent names: white horses are neither white nor horse, but\na distinct sort of thing. This \u201csolution\u201d is absurd, of\ncourse. But moving beyond the one-name-one-thing model and explaining\nexactly why this is absurd was a legitimate philosophical\npuzzle at the\n time.[23]\n\nThe other complete, genuine essay attributed to Gongsun Long is the\nnear-impenetrable \u201cDiscourse on Indicating Things.\u201d For a\ndiscussion of this text, see the supplementary document:\n\nIndicating and Things\n\n",
