    "main_text": "Chance Without Randomness || The Reference Class Problem\n4.2 The Reference Class Problem\n\n\nAny given token event is an instance of many different types of\ntrial:\n\n\nIt is obvious that every individual thing or event has an indefinite\nnumber of properties or attributes observable in it, and might\ntherefore be considered as belonging to an indefinite number of\ndifferent classes of things\u2026 (Venn 1876: 194)\n\n\nSuppose Lizzie tosses a coin on Tuesday; this particular coin toss\nmay be considered as a coin toss; a coin toss on a Tuesday; a coin toss\nby Lizzie; an event caused by Lizzie; etc. Each of these ways of typing\nthe outcome give rise to different outcome sequences, some of which may\nbe random, while others are not. Each of these outcome sequences is\nunified by a homogenous kind of trial; as such, they may all be\nsuitable sequences to play a role in RCT.\n\n\nThis is not a problem if chance too is relative to a type of trial,\nfor we may simply make the dependence on choice of reference class\nexplicit in both sides of RCT. If chances were relative frequencies, it\nwould be easy enough to see why chance is relative to a type of trial.\nBut chances aren\u2019t frequencies, and single-case chance is almost\nuniversally taken to be not only well-defined for a specific event, but\nunique for that event. We naturally speak of the chance that\nthis coin will lands heads on its next toss, with the chance taken to\nbe a property of the possible outcome directly, and not mediated by\nsome particular description of that outcome as an instance of this or\nthat kind of trial. Moreover, for chance to play its role in the\n Principal Principle\n (\u00a71\n and Supplement\n A.1),\n there must be a unique chance for a\ngiven event that is to guide our rational credence, as we have only one\ncredence in a particular proposition stating the occurrence of that\nevent. (Indeed, the inability of frequentists to single out a unique\nreference class, the frequency in which is the chance, was taken to be\na decisive objection to frequentism.) On the standard understanding of\nchance, then, there is a mismatch between the left and right sides of\nthe RCT. And this gives rise to a counterexample to RCT, if we take an\nevent with a unique non-trivial single-case chance, but such that at\nleast one way of classifying the trial which produced it is such that\nthe sequence of outcomes of all trials of that kind is not random. The\ntrivial case might be this: a coin is tossed and lands heads. That\nevent happened by chance, yet it is of the type \u2018coin toss which\nlands heads\u2019, and the sequence consisting of all outcomes of that\ntype is not random.\n\n\nThe natural response\u2014and the response most frequentists\n offered, with the possible exception of von\n Mises[14]\u2014was\n to narrow\n the available reference classes. (As noted in Supplement\n A.3,\n many frequentists were explicit that\nchances were frequencies in repetitions of natural kinds of processes.)\nSalmon (1977) appeals to objectively homogenous reference classes\n(those which cannot be partitioned by any relevant property into\nsubclasses which differ in attribute frequency to the original\nreference class). Salmon\u2019s proposal, in effect, is that homogeneous\nreference classes are random sequences, the evident circularity of\nwhich will hardly constitute a reply to the present objection.\nReichenbach (1949: 374) proposed to \u2018proceed by considering the\nnarrowest class for which reliable statistics can be compiled\u2019,\nwhich isn\u2019t circular, but which fails to respond to the objection since\nit provides no guarantee that there will be only one such class. There\nmay well be multiple classes which are equally \u2018narrow\u2019 and\nfor which reliable statistics can be collected (Gillies, 2000: 816). In\nthe present context, this will amount to a number of sequences long\nenough to make for reliable judgements of their randomness or lack\nthereof.\n\n\nThis objection requires the chance of an event to be insensitive to\nreference class. Recently, H\u00e1jek (2007) has argued that\nno adequate conception of probability is immune to a reference\nclass problem, so that this requirement cannot be met. (For a related\nview of relativised chance, though motivated by quite different\nconsiderations, see Glynn 2010.) However, as H\u00e1jek notes, this\nconclusion makes it difficult to see how chance could guide credence,\nand it remains an open question whether a relativised theory of chance\nthat meets the platitudes concerning chance can be developed.\n",
