    "main_text": "Major Arguments from the Treasury of the Abhidharma || Disproof of the Self\n2.1 Disproof of the Self\n\nThe Buddhist approach to the question of personal continuity attracts\nperhaps more attention from contemporary philosophy than any other\naspect of the\n tradition.[16]\n Vasubandhu\u2019s Commentary on the Treasury of the\nAbhidharma includes, as its final chapter, an extended defense of\nthe Buddhist doctrine of no-self, entitled, \u201cThe Refutation of\nthe Person.\u201d The majority of the argument assumes a Buddhist\ninterlocutor, and is intended to prove that no Buddhist ought to\naccept the reality of a so-called \u201cself\u201d\n(\u0101tman) or \u201cperson\u201d (pudgala) over\nand above the five aggregates (skandhas) in which, the Buddha\nsaid, the person consists. (The aggregates, as their name suggests,\nare themselves constantly-changing collections of entities of five\ncategories: the physical, feelings, ideas, dispositions, and\nconsciousness.) Vasubandhu apparently believed that the\nV\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas, also called Pudgalav\u0101dins or\n\u201cPersonalists,\u201d represented a significant, Buddhist rival.\nLate in the chapter, Vasubandhu also provides some arguments that are\ntargeted at a Vai\u015be\u1e63ika (Hindu) view of the self.\n\nThe chapter begins with a brief statement of the soteriological\npurpose of the treatise, and something of a definition of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings. Vasubandhu says that for outsiders (meaning\noutsiders to Buddhism), there is no possibility of liberation, because\nall other systems impose a false construct of a self upon what is\nreally only the continuum of aggregates (skandha). Since\ngrasping the self generates the mental afflictions\n(kle\u015ba), liberation from suffering is impossible for one\nwho holds onto the false, non-Buddhist view that the self has\nindependent reality.\n\nVasubandhu does not attempt, here, to prove the karmic causality that\njustifies his soteriological exclusivism. Instead, he moves directly\nto prove the non-existence of the self. What is real, he says, is\nknown by one of two means: perception or\n inference.[17]\n Seven things are known directly, by perception. They include the five\nobjects of the senses (visual forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and\ntouchables), mental objects (mental images or ideas), and the mind\n itself.[18]\n What is not known directly can only be known indirectly, by\ninference. As an example, Vasubandhu provides an argument that the\nfive sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin) can each be\ninferred from the awareness of their respective sensory objects. But,\nhe says, there is no such inference for the self. Since Vasubandhu\nbelieves in universal momentariness (see the section on Momentariness\nand Continuity), he would reject Descartes\u2019 deduction of\n\u201cI am,\u201d as an enduring self, from the perception of the\nmomentary mental event, \u201cI think.\u201d\n\nVasubandhu does not list the five aggregates here, but his discussion\nof perception and inference stands in for having done so. Any Buddhist\nscholastic would be able to see that he has claimed to have proven the\nreality of the twelve sense bases (\u0101yatana), and these\ntwelve are easy to correlate with the five aggregates. The first\naggregate, the physical (r\u016bpa), includes the five\nsensory organs and their five objects. The second, third, and fourth\naggregates\u2014feelings (vedan\u0101), thoughts\n(sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), and dispositions\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra)\u2014are kinds of mental objects. The\nfifth aggregate, consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na), is\nequivalent to the twelfth sense base, the\n mind.[19]\n Earlier in the Treasury Vasubandhu had included other\nelements within the five aggregates (including, for instance,\navij\u00f1apti-r\u016bpa, which is imperceptible, within\nthe physical), but since he had also provided arguments\ndisproving those elements (see the section on Disproof of\nInvisible Physicality), perhaps he felt no compulsion to include them\nhere. Focusing on the twelve sense bases may be Vasubandhu\u2019s way\nof providing as clean and parsimonious a Buddhist ontology as he\ncan.\n\n\n\n\u00a012 Sense Bases\u00a0\n5 Aggregates \n\nEye\nPhysical \n\nVisual Form \n\nEar \n\nSound \n\nNose \n\nSmell \n\nTongue \n\nTaste \n\nSkin/Body \n\nTouchable \n\nMind\n\u00a0Consciousness\u00a0 \n\nMental Object\nFeelings \n\nThoughts \n\nDispositions  \n\n\nIn any event, Vasubandhu is affirming the mainstream Buddhist view\nthat the constantly-changing elements, which seem to be the\npossessions of, or the components of, the so-called\n\u201cself,\u201d are real, while the self is unreal. Buddhists\nreadily admit that this view is counterintuitive (if it were intuitive\nwe would all be liberated), and many doubts may arise when it is\nposited: If there is no self, then what is the same about me as a\nchild and as an adult? What is named by my name? What perceives\nperceptions, or experiences experiences, or enacts actions, if not the\nself? What is memory, without a self? And crucially, from a Buddhist\nperspective, what transmigrates from one body to the next, and reaps\nthe karmic fruit of good and evil deeds, if not a self? These are all\nquestions of great importance in Buddhist philosophical treatments of\nthe doctrine of no-self, and Vasubandhu will address them each in due\ncourse. Vasubandhu begins, however, by focusing on certain commonsense\nadvantages to the no-self view, and exposing the difficulties in\nholding to the reality of the self. His first target, then, is\nBuddhist \u201cPersonalists.\u201d\n\nFor Vasubandhu, everything that is real or substantial\n(dravya) is causally efficient, having specifiable\ncause-and-effect relations with other entities. Everything that does\nnot have such a causal basis is unreal, and if anything, it is merely\na conceptual construct, a mere convention (praj\u00f1apti).\nThe so-called \u201cperson,\u201d like everything else, must be one\nor the other\u2014real or unreal, causally conditioned or\nconceptually constructed. Vasubandhu places it in the latter category.\nNotice that, to call something a \u201cconceptual construction\u201d\n(parikalpita) is, for Vasubandhu, to remove it from the flow\nof causality. Abstract entities have no causal impetus and are unreal.\nThis is Vasubandhu\u2019s formalization, and expansion, of the\nBuddhist doctrine that all conditioned things are impermanent. Some\nBuddhists accept (for instance) that space and nirvana are real,\nthough unconditioned. Vasubandhu says, instead, that all things that\nare engaged with the causal world must be, themselves, conditioned\n(this is a corollary of his proof of momentariness), so he rejects the\ncausal capacity of eternal, unchanging entities. But even setting\naside Vasubandhu\u2019s expanded view, it is clearly out of the\nquestion for Buddhists to say that the self is unconditioned\nand eternal. That is a non-Buddhist view, which Vasubandhu treats\nlater on.\n\nVasubandhu thus begins his argument by posing a dilemma for the\nPersonalists, between saying that the \u201cperson\u201d is\nuncaused\u2014which would be to adopt a non-Buddhist view\u2014and\nspecifying the cause. Since the Buddha explained the aggregates to be\nthe psychophysical elements that make up the person, any posited\n\u201cself\u201d must be in some way related to those entities. But\nthe Personalists will not wish to say simply that the\n\u201cperson\u201d is caused by the aggregates. For, the aggregates\nare temporary and impermanent in the extreme. The whole issue at hand\nis how to account for the continuity of the person as the aggregates\nchange. If the aggregates are the cause(s) of the person, then the\nperson, too, must change as they change. As Vasubandhu explains in\ncriticizing a parallel context, \u201cNo unchanging quality is seen\nto inhere in changing substances.\u201d (AKBh\n 159.20)[20]\n If the causal basis is accepted as changing, the \u201cperson\u201d\nis no longer continuous across the aggregates and through time. So a\n\u201cperson\u201d caused by the aggregates provides no answer to\nthe doubts about personal identity raised above.\n\nYet for Vasubandhu, if the cause cannot be specified, then the person\nmust be conceptually constructed. He adduces the following as an\nexample of conceptual construction: When we see, smell, and taste\nmilk, we have distinct sensory impressions, which are combined in our\nawareness. The \u201cmilk,\u201d then, is a mental construct\u2014a\nconcept built out of discrete sensory impressions. The sensory\nimpressions are real, but the milk is not. In the same way, the\n\u201cself\u201d is made up of constantly-changing sensory organs,\nsensory impressions, ideas, and mental events. These separate,\nmomentary elements are real, but their imagined unity\u2014as an\nenduring \u201cI\u201d\u2014is a false projection.\n\nThe Personalists are willing to accept that the person is a conceptual\nconstruction, but they do not accept that this makes it unreal, or\ncausally inert. They believe in a perceptible \u201cperson,\u201d\nwho is ineffably neither the same as nor distinct from the aggregates,\nbut who comes into existence in a particular lifetime \u201cdepending\nupon\u201d the aggregates. Vasubandhu considers this a muddled\nattempt to have one\u2019s cake and eat it too. He focuses in on this\nterm, \u201cdepending upon.\u201d If, by this, the Personalists mean\n\u201cdependent as a conceptual object,\u201d he says, then really\nthey are conceding that the term \u201cperson\u201d actually just\nrefers to the aggregates. It is to admit that the aggregates are\nunderstood as unified through a mere conceptual construction,\n\u201cperson,\u201d just as the taste, touch, and smell of milk\ngenerate the conceptual construction, \u201cmilk.\u201d If, on the\nother hand, they are saying the \u201cperson\u201d is\ncausally dependent upon the aggregates, then they are saying\nthat the \u201cperson\u201d is caused by the aggregates, which is to\nspecify its causes among impermanent entities.\n\nThere is, for Vasubandhu, no acceptable explanation of conceptual\nconstructs as real entities. His exclusive dichotomy (real &\ncausal vs. unreal & conceptual) serves not only as a tool for\nrefusing a separate self, but also as a method of denying apparent\nsubject/object relations or apparent substance/quality relations, and\ntranslating them into linear, causal series. For instance, he says\nthat objects of awareness do not exist as causally significant\nentities distinct from consciousness; rather, consciousness is\ncaused by its apparent objects, from which it takes on a\nparticular shape (\u0101k\u0101ra). This is how Vasubandhu\nresolves some of the standard challenges to the no-self view, such as\nthe question of how experience can exist without an experiencer. The\nanswer is that any given awareness only appears to be made up\nof two parts, subject and object, a \u201ccognizer\u201d acting upon\na cognitive object. In reality, any given moment of awareness consists\nin a full, constructed appearance of subject/object duality without\nthere actually being any separate subject. The object is an aspect or\nshape of the consciousness itself. Similarly, when asked with regard\nto memory \u201cwho\u201d remembers if not the self, Vasubandhu\nrejects the subject/object structure. What is really occurring is only\na series of discrete elements in the continuum of aggregates, which\narise successively, causally linked to one another. The reason I\nremember my past is because my aggregates now are the causal result of\nthe past aggregates whose actions I remember. My consciousness today\narises with the shape of my past aggregates imprinted upon it.\n\nMoving on, the \u201cdependence\u201d relation that the Personalists\nare attempting to defend resists none of Vasubandhu\u2019s arguments\n(a casualty, perchance, of its appearing as a counterargument within\nhis text), but the Personalists persist by stating that the relation\nbetween the person and the aggregates is \u201cineffable.\u201d To\nthis, Vasubandhu argues, interestingly, that ineffability in regard to\nan entity that is ostensibly perceived undermines the functionality of\nperception as a source of knowledge. Without any way of\ndistinguishing, clearly, what is perceived directly and what is\nperceived \u201cineffably,\u201d all of perception becomes\npotentially ineffable. And, perhaps more importantly, not everything\nis said by the Buddha to be ineffable, or at least not equally so. For\ninstance, when the Buddha denies the reality of the self, he does so\nin contradistinction to the sense bases. If the\n\u201cperson\u201d also exists as an object of sensory perception,\nhow can this distinction be upheld?\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s dialogue with the Personalists takes some rather\ntechnical twists and turns, which I will not attempt to cover here.\nSee the section on scripture for a summary of Vasubandhu\u2019s\nmethods of scriptural interpretation, which he employs decisively to\ndefend against the Personalist adducement of the Buddha\u2019s\nsilence on the nature of the person. I will here mention only one\nfurther argument against the Personalists, before treating\nVasubandhu\u2019s arguments with non-Buddhists.\n\nThe Personalist challenges Vasubandhu to explain how it can be, if\neverything is only a constantly-changing fluctuation of\ncausally-connected separate entities, that things do not arise in\npredictable patterns. Why is there so much unpredictable change, the\nPersonalists are asking, if there is no independent person who enacts\nthose changes? This is a question that seems to be affirming a greater\ndegree of freedom of the will than would appear possible were there\nnot some outside, uncaused intervener in the causal flow. If I am\nreading it correctly, it is something like an incredulous denial that\nwe could be \u201cmere automatons,\u201d given our capacities for\ninnovation and creativity. Vasubandhu\u2019s answer is to emphasize\nthe possibility of change in a self-regulating\n system.[21]\n\nVasubandhu points out that in fact, there are predictable\npatterns to the causal fluctuations of thoughts, so it is a mistake to\ncall them unpredictable. Seeing a woman, he says, causes you to think\nthoughts that you tend to think when you look at women. (If we needed\nit, here\u2019s confirmation that the implied reader is a\nheterosexual male\u2014though probably a celibate one.) If you\npractice leaving a woman alone in your thoughts (for instance, by\npracticing thinking of the woman\u2019s overprotective father, as\nmonks are taught to do), then when you see a woman you\u2019ll reject\nher in your thoughts. If you do not practice this, other thoughts\narise: \u201c\u2026then those [thoughts] which are most frequent\n[or clearest], or most proximate arise, because they have been most\nforcefully cultivated, except when there are simultaneous special\nconditions external to the body.\u201d (Kapstein 2001a: 370) This is\nan argument that undermines a na\u00efve trust in the independence of\nthe will. But of course, Vasubandhu adds, just because the mind is\nsubject to conditions does not mean that it will always be the same.\nOn the contrary, it is fundamental to the definition of conditioned\nthings that they are always changing.\n\nIt is with this setup that Vasubandhu turns to address the\nnon-Buddhist sectarians, asking them to account as elegantly as his\ncausal, no-self view does, for the changing flux of mental events.\nFor, the non-Buddhist opponent believes in an independent self who is\nthe agent and controller of mental actions. If that is so, Vasubandhu\nchallenges them, why do mental events arise in such disorder? Just\nwhat kind of a controller is the \u201cself\u201d? This is an\nimportant point, because it implies that Buddhists might use as\nevidence what is introspectively obvious to any\nmeditator\u2014namely, the difficulty of controlling the mind. If the\n\u201cself\u201d is an uncaused agent, why can\u2019t I, for\ninstance, focus my concentration indefinitely? Non-Buddhist\n(orthodox/Hindu) traditions generally affirm that the mind must be\ncontrolled, and harnessed, by the self; this is one of the central\nmeanings of the term yoga (lit. \u201cyoking\u201d) in\nclassical Hinduism. And, of course, the reason that such\n\u201cyoking\u201d is necessary is that the mind has its own causal\nimpetus, which overwhelms the self unless and until the self attains\nliberation. Vasubandhu asks why, if changes in experience must be\nadmitted to originate in the fluctuations of the mind, it should be\nbelieved that the \u201cyoking\u201d and other willful, agent-driven\nevents originate outside of the mind in an unchanging\n\u201cself.\u201d The need for such an explanation is evidence that\nthe \u201cself\u201d requires a more burdensome (less simple)\ntheoretical structure than might appear at first blush.\n\nThe Buddhist view has an in-built explanation for the difficulty of\nchanging the mind\u2019s dispositions. Each temporary collection of\npsychophysical entities generates, through causal regularities,\nanother collection in the next moment. The mind\u2019s present\ndispositions are conditioned by its past, and its every experience is\nonly an expression of its internal transformations, triggered of\ncourse by influences coming from outside the individual. It is widely\nconsidered a difficulty for the Buddhist no-self view that it has\ntrouble accounting for our intuitive senses of continuity and control.\nBut here we see Vasubandhu turning a disadvantage into an advantage.\nThe intuitive sense of control is a mistake. This is introspectively\nobvious and is implicit in the non-Buddhist\u2019s admission that a\nmental series, distinct from the \u201cself,\u201d is dependent upon\nits own causal impetus. Of course, the non-Buddhists have a panoply of\ntheories explaining the relation between the self and the mental\nevents with which it is complexly entwined. This is territory over\nwhich Indian thought contemplates free will and determinism.\nVasubandhu does not enter into these debates in any detail. His\ninterest is only to indicate the Buddhist position\u2019s comparative\nsimplicity and causal parsimony.\n\nIn the last stages of the chapter, Vasubandhu\u2019s non-Buddhist\nbeliever in a permanent self proposes several potential\ncounter-arguments. Here Vasubandhu addresses a number of common\nworries about the no-self view, including the questions of experience\nand agency without a self. With regard to experience, Vasubandhu\nsimply makes reference to the argument above in which the\nsubject/object relation was described in a causal line, with the\nobject causing a consciousness to take on the \u201cshape\u201d or\nappearance of an object. An individual, momentary consciousness does\nnot need to be possessed by a self in order to have a certain\nappearance. With regard to agency, Vasubandhu again redescribes the\nstructure under consideration\u2014in this case, the act/agent\nstructure\u2014as a unitary, causal line: \u201cFrom recollection\nthere is interest; from interest consideration; from consideration\nwillful effort; from willful effort vital energy; and from that,\naction. So what does the self do\n here?\u201d[22]\n (Kapstein 2001a: 373) The point, again, is not that there is no\naction, but that action takes place as one event in a causal series,\nno element of which requires an independent agent.\n\nThe last argument in the work addresses the crucial, Buddhist concern\nabout karmic fruits. If there is no self, how can there be karmic\nresults accruing to the agent of karmic acts? What can it mean to say\nthat, if I kill someone, I go to hell, when there is no\n\u201cI\u201d? The way the question is phrased is in terms of a\ntechnical question about the nature of karmic retribution. The way\nthat karma works in the non-Buddhist schools is, naturally, via the\nself. In one way or another, karmic residue adheres to the soul/self.\nIf there is no soul that is affected by the karmic residue, how can\nyou be affected at a later time by a previous cause? How can something\nI do now affect me at the time of my death, if at that time the deed\nwill be in the past?\n\nVasubandhu gives a clear, if quick reply. A complete answer to this\nquestion would require a fuller discussion of the question of\n continuity.[23]\n (See the sections Momentariness and Continuity and Disproof of\nInvisible Physicality below.) The short answer is simply that the past\naction inaugurates a causal series, which eventuates in the result at\na later time via a number of intermediate steps. When I act now, it\ndoes not alter some eternal soul, but it does alter the future of my\naggregates by sparking a causal series. As he does many times\nthroughout his disproof of the person, Vasubandhu encourages his\nopponents to recognize the term \u201cI\u201d as simply referring to\nthe continuum of aggregates. The conceptual construction\n\u201cI\u201d is then understood to be only a manner of speaking, a\nuseful shorthand. He mentions that when I say \u201cI am pale,\u201d\nI know that it is only my body, not my eternal self, that is pale. Why\nnot apply such figurative use to the term overall? Then, when I say\nthat \u201cI\u201d experience the result of \u201cmy\u201d\nactions, it can be seen to be both clear and accurate. Granted, it\nseems like there is a real \u201cself.\u201d But it only\nlooks that way, just as a line of ants looks like a brown stripe on\nthe ground. Close philosophical and introspective attention reveals\nthat what seemed like a solid, coherent whole is in fact a false\nmental construction based upon a failure to notice its countless,\nfluctuating parts.\n",
