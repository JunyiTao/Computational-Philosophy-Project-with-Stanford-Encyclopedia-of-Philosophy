    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of language since Frege has emphasized propositions and\ndeclarative sentences, but it is clear that questions and\ninterrogative sentences are just as important. Scientific\ninvestigation and explanation proceed in part through the posing and\nanswering of questions, and human dialogues as well as human-computer\ninteractions are often structured in terms of questions and\nanswers.\n\nAfter going over some preliminaries we will focus on three lines of\nwork on questions: one located at the intersection of philosophy of\nlanguage and formal semantics, focusing on the semantics of what\nBelnap and Steel (1976) call elementary questions; a second\nlocated at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy\nof science, focusing on why-questions and the notion of explanation;\nand a third located at the intersection of philosophy of language and\nepistemology, focusing on embedded questions.\n",
