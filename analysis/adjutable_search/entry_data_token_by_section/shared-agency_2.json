How is the structure of interrelated intentions established?\n\nSo shared activity is distinguished from a mere aggregation of\nindividual acts by a structure of appropriately related participatory\nintentions across different individuals. It is a structure that has a\ndistinctive normative significance for those individuals, with an\nimpact most immediately on each individual\u2019s intention-based\npractical\n reasoning.[23]\n\nIt is natural to think that this structure of intentions is brought\nabout by individuals involved in shared activity, presumably when each\nforms the participatory intention that is his or her contribution to\nthe structure. But recall that participatory intentions are meant to\ncapture the sense in which each individual is committed to what\neveryone is doing together, and not merely to what he or she is doing.\nThus, Searle says of an instance of shared activity that\n\u201cI\u2019m pushing only as a part of our pushing.\u201d This\nsuggests that what is intended is the entirety of the\nactivity, something reflected in Bratman\u2019s intentions of the\nform I intend that we\n J.[24]\n\nBut as Velleman has shown, given the standard understanding of\nintentions, it\u2019s not clear that one can intend the entire\nactivity; or if one can, it would seem incompatible with the activity\nbeing\n shared.[25]\n Intending is something I do to settle a deliberative issue: weighing\nseveral options, I decide on A-ing, and thereby intend to A. This\nsuggests the Settling\n Condition[26]\n that I can only intend what I take to be up to me to decide or\nsettle. It is a violation of a rational requirement to intend\nsomething I don\u2019t think I can settle, and thus regard my ensuing\nplans and actions as likely coming to grief. Applying the point to\ncollective action, to say that I intend for us to be dining together\npresumes that whether we\u2019re dining together is something for\nme to settle. But the idea behind shared activity\nand intention is precisely that it\u2019s not entirely up to\nme what we do. You have a say in the matter; at the very least what\nyou do should be up to you (see also Schmid 2008). Our\nproblem, then, is that shared activity would seem both to demand and\nto disallow one and the same intention on the part of each\n participant.[27]\n\nSeveral responses have emerged to this problem. Velleman develops a\nsolution that invokes interdependent conditional\n intentions.[28]\n Each individual conditionally settles what the group will do, where\nthe condition is that each of the others has a similar commitment and\nintends likewise. Thus, I intend to J, on condition that you\nintend likewise. Some have worried that when intentions are\ninterdependent in this way it\u2019s not entirely clear that they\nsettle anything at all, and hence, whether anyone is appropriately\ncommitted to our J-ing. If each intention is conditioned on\nthe other, it\u2019s just as reasonable to refrain from acting as it\nis to engage in it. For discussion, see Roth 2004, 373\u201380;\nBacharach 2006, 137ff. Gilbert 2002, while addressing Robins 2002 and\na precursor of Roth 2004 disavows the interdependent conditional view\nattributed to her by Velleman, Roth, and Robins. See also Gilbert\n2003, 2009. Velleman himself is sensitive to something like this worry\n(1997a, 39) and it shapes how he formulates the content of the\nconditional\n intention.[29]\n\nBratman (1997) has suggested that what an individual intends can\nextend beyond what he can settle himself, so long as he can reasonably\npredict that the relevant other parties will act appropriately.\nFlagrantly disregarding sound medical advice, I can have the\ncategorical intention to work on my tan at the beach this afternoon,\nso long as I can reasonably predict that it\u2019ll be sunny.\nLikewise, when I reasonably believe that you have or will have the\nappropriate intentions, I can then intend that we J. One might wonder\nwhether taking this sort of predictive attitude with respect to the\nintentions and actions of fellow participants is consistent with\nsharing an intention and acting with them. On the other hand,\nit\u2019s not obvious that the prediction of an action entails that\nit is or must be regarded as involuntary or otherwise problematic. If\nso, the predictive attitude toward others very well may be compatible\nwith acting with them, and might account for how our\nJ-ing might be the object of my\n intention.[30]\n\nAnother suggestion is that a participant intends not the entirety of\nthe activity, but only his or her part in it. Such an intention is\nmore modest in that it does not purport to settle what other people\ndo. An account of shared activity in terms of such intentions (e.g.\nTuomela & Miller 1998, Kutz 2000) does not entail the authority or\ncontrol over others that would be difficult to reconcile with the\nactivity being shared. But this modest intention involves a commitment\nonly to one\u2019s part in our J-ing and doesn\u2019t seem to\naccount for a participatory commitment to our J-ing as a whole. To see\nwhy not, consider the case of walking together from Gilbert 1990. We\nmight describe my part as walking at a certain pace. But intending to\ndo that is entirely compatible with undermining my partner\u2019s\ncontribution, for example by tripping him. Suppose instead that we\navail ourselves of some robust conception of part, so that\neach participant intends to do his part in shared activity, as\nsuch. This would appear to rule out attempts to undermine a\npartner\u2019s contribution. But what exactly is this intention? It\nseems to presuppose an understanding of the concept of shared\nactivity, which is the notion we\u2019re trying to\n elucidate.[31]\n\nMaybe this criticism is too quick. Perhaps there remains a way to\ncharacterize the intention to do one\u2019s part that doesn\u2019t\npresuppose the notion of shared activity. One approach appeals to\n\u201cteam reasoning\u201d, a distinctive form of strategic\npractical reasoning. This view of reasoning was developed to address\ncertain difficulties standard game theory has in accounting for the\nrationality of selecting more cooperative options in strategic\nscenarios such as the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and Hi-Lo. The idea is\nthat we get intuitively more rational outcomes with individuals each\napproaching the situation asking him- or herself not what\u2019s\nbest for me given what others do?, but what\nis best for us or the group as a\n whole?[32]\n The participatory intention is characterized in terms of the\ndistinctive reasoning that leads to its formation, rather than in\nterms of some more intrinsic feature of the intention or its content.\nIt remains to be seen whether intending one\u2019s part, so\nunderstood, can account for the participatory commitment distinctive\nof shared\n activity.[33]\n\nThe issue of how to establish the interpersonal structure of\nparticipatory intention is a central problem for the theory of shared\nagency, and remains an area of active research interest. For further\nviews, see Gilbert 2009 (some discussion of which is below),\nKorsgaard\u2019s interpretation of Kant in her 2009, 189ff, and Roth\n2004, whose conception of intentions allows him to appeal to an\ninterpersonal mechanism similar in some respects to that of\ncommands.\n",
