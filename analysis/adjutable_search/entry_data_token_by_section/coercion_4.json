In the period prior to 1969, there were of\ncourse some differences among theorists, but there seems to be a\nmainstream view of coercion that is more or less continuous with the\nview found in Aquinas and Hobbes/Locke/Kant (and some of the views of\nBentham and Mill). This view identifies coercion with the use of force\nor violence, as well as to threats of the same. For instance, Hans\nKelsen explains the nature of law by saying,\n\nAs a coercive order, the law is distinguished from other social\norders. The decisive criterion is the element of force \u2014 that\nmeans that the act prescribed by the order as a consequence of\nsocially detrimental facts ought to be executed even against the will\nof the individual and, if he resists, by physical force (Kelsen 1967\n[1934], 34).\n\n\nKelsen goes on to count as coercive acts such things as detaining\nthose suspected of crimes, detaining for protective custody, detaining\nof the insane, detaining in internment camps potential enemies of the\nstate, and the confiscation or destruction of property (Kelsen 1967\n[1934], 40\u201341).\n\nJ. R. Lucas puts a slightly different cast on a similar thought,\nemphasizing the importance of a technique by which one agent (e.g.,\nthe state) can assure that its decisions are implemented.\n\n[W]e are concerned with the enforcement of decisions: we are\nconsidering the conditions under which decisions will be carried out\nregardless of the recalcitrance of the bloody minded. We therefore\ndefine force in terms of bloody-mindedness, of what happens\nirrespective of how recalcitrant a man is, of what happens to him\nwilly-nilly. Force, then, we say, is being used against a man, if in\nhis private experience or in his environment either something is being\ndone which he does not want to be done but which he is unable to\nprevent in spite of all his efforts, or he is being prevented, in\nspite of all his efforts, from doing something which he wants to do,\nand which he otherwise could have done by himself alone. A man is\nbeing coerced when either force is being used against him or\nhis behaviour is being determined by the threat of force (Lucas 1966,\n57; emphasis in the original).\n\n\n[I]mprisonment is the paradigm form of coercion.\u2026 Even if it\nwere not regarded as a penalty, it would still be effective in\nfrustrating the efforts of the recalcitrant to prevent a judicial\ndecision being implemented (Lucas 1966, 60).\n\n\nIf there is a single, continuous thread that runs through the various\nthoughts about coercion surveyed above, I believe it could be\nidentified as Lucas suggests with a concern for the ability of some\nagents to implement and enforce decisions about the activities of\nothers. With the possible exception of Mill, who allows for a greater\nrange of coercive methods than the others surveyed, this general idea\nseems to capture what one might have said was essential in the concept\nof coercion as pre-modern and modern political theorists employed it,\nby name or (in the case of Locke) by function.\n\n",
