    "main_text": "Disjunctivist Accounts of Hallucination and Illusion || Hallucination\n5.1 Hallucination\n\n\nSome disjunctivists say relatively little about the nature of\nhallucination (e.g., McDowell, Campbell and Brewer). For example,\nMcDowell characterises hallucinatory experience as a \u201cmere\nappearance\u201d that such and such is the case, which seems to leave\nopen whether a more positive account can potentially be given. Dancy\n(1995) suggests that the disjunctivist should offer a more direct\ncharacterization of the kind of experience that occurs when one\nhallucinates, rather than simply characterising it solely by saying\nthat it is like what it is not. He suggests that in a fully explicit\nversion of the disjunctive theory hallucination would be characterised\nin a direct, positive way.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist who allows that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations can have the same phenomenal character may take up this\nsuggestion. (See Logue 2012a and 2013.) This disjunctivist may be able\nto provide some positive account of the phenomenal character that\nveridical perception and hallucination can share, while allowing that\nthere are certain mental properties distinctive of veridical\nperception (e.g., its possessing an object-dependent intentional\ncontent.) However, for reasons explained in the previous section,\nMartin argues that the disjunctivist who is a na\u00efve realist about\nthe phenomenal character of veridical perception (and so who holds\nthat veridical perceptions have phenomenal properties that\nhallucinations cannot possess) should reject Dancy\u2019s\nproposal. Martin commits to the claim that in the case of certain\nhallucinations (i.e., those which have the same kind of proximate\ncause as veridical perceptions), there is no more to their phenomenal\ncharacter than that of being introspectively indiscriminible from a\nveridical perception.\n\n\nThis particular claim has drawn a great deal of criticism. Siegel\n(2004) argues that Martin\u2019s account fails to accommodate the\ndifferent kinds of hallucinations that can be experienced by a creature\nwho lacks the conceptual capacities to make introspective judgements\nabout its experience. E.g., suppose a dog is having a hallucination. Due\nto conceptual incapacities the dog is not in position to know that he\nis not perceiving a tomato, so for the dog this experience is\nintrospectively indiscriminible from a perception of a tomato. However,\nfrom this fact alone it does not follow that the dog is having a\nhallucination of a tomato.\n\n\nSiegel (2004) also argues that Martin\u2019s account fails to capture the\nfact that our hallucinations are phenomenally conscious, for a state\nthat is not phenomenally conscious can satisfy the description of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a genuine\nperception. Furthermore, she argues (in Siegel 2008) that Martin\u2019s\naccount cannot adequately explain certain effects of\nhallucinations\u2014i.e., what grounds one\u2019s positive knowledge of\nthe kind of experience one is and isn\u2019t having. Along related lines,\nSturgeon (1998) suggests that the disjunctivist who denies that it is\npossible to provide a positive account of the phenomenal character of\na hallucination does not have the resources to explain adequately how\nit is that having a hallucination of an F can provide one\nwith positive knowledge concerning what it is like to veridically\nperceive an F. (See also Pautz 2010 and 2011.) Johnston\n(2004) argues that the disjunctivist offers no satisfactory\nexplanation of the fact that hallucination can provide us with\noriginal de re knowledge of quality (e.g., the fact that a\nhallucination as of a red object can provide its subject with de re\nknowledge of the quality of redness).\n\n\nMartin (2006) attempts to defend his account of hallucination\nagainst his critics, by (a) focusing on the issue of how we should\nunderstand the notion of indiscriminability in play in his talk of\n\u2018introspective indiscriminability\u2019, and (b) focusing on the\nquestion of the model of introspection we should adopt when our concern\nis with the way in which we introspect our phenomenally conscious\nmental states. Both aspects of Martin\u2019s defence of his view have\nbeen contested.\n\n\nMartin suggests that the notion of indiscriminability that the\ndisjunctivist should appeal to is an \u2018impersonal\u2019,\n\u2018objective\u2019 one. He compares the way in which we can talk\nof objects being visible or invisible. He suggests that in certain\ncontexts, when we say that something is invisible, we may not be\ntalking about the way a given individual, or group of individuals, is\nsuch that they cannot succeed in seeing the object. We may rather be\ntalking about what vision can and cannot discern. Furthermore,\nin asking what vision can reveal to us, we can ask in terms of how\nvision actually is, or ways in which vision could be. The most\nextreme claim of invisibility would be concerned with the latter\nnotion. The suggestion seems to be that we should not think that such\n\u2018impersonal\u2019, \u2018objective\u2019 talk of invisibility\nneed be reducible to claims about what a given subject, group of\nsubjects, or ideal subject would or would not see. So similarly, we\nshould not take the impersonal, objective talk of introspective\nindiscriminability as reducible to claims about what a given subject,\ngroup of subjects, or ideal subject would or would not come to know\nthrough introspection.\n\n\nMartin notes an objection that this comparison with sight might give\nrise to. When two objects are impersonally indiscriminible through\nsight, we tend to think that the objects in question must share a\nproperty\u2014an appearance\u2014that is detectible through\nvision. The fact that two visible objects cannot be told apart by sight\nsuggests that there is something in common between them that sight does\ndetect. So we might also think that if two experiences are\nintrospectively indiscriminible, these experiences must share a\nproperty\u2014a phenomenal property\u2014that introspection is\ntracking. Martin\u2019s response to this objection is to reject a\nmodel of introspection that he thinks lies behind it. Martin suggests\nthat in a case in which two objects are impersonally visually\nindiscriminible, we are led to posit a common appearance the objects\nshare that vision can discern, because we think of sight as a mode of\ncoming to be aware of a realm independent of it. So, according to\nMartin, the same story will apply to the case of introspection only if\nwe suppose that when one introspects the phenomenal character of\none\u2019s experience one is detecting features of some realm that is\nindependent of one\u2019s introspective access to it. Martin argues\nthat if one adopts this model of introspection then one will either\nhave to allow that it is possible for one\u2019s experience to have a\nreal phenomenal nature rather different from the one it introspectively\nseems to have, which remains inaccessible to introspection, or one will\nhave to accept that introspection involves the use of a\n\u201csuper-mechanism\u201d, which tracks the phenomenal character of\none\u2019s experience in a such a way that it cannot fail, or can only\nfail when it is knowable that it has.\n\n\nOn Martin\u2019s recommended alternative, a subject\u2019s introspective perspective on her\nexperience coincides with, and is not independent of, her\nexperiential perspective on the world. There is no way of specifying a\nmechanism of introspection such that there could be a way in which it\ngoes wrong, not because the faculty of introspection is a\n\u201csuper-mechanism\u201d, but rather because there is no mechanism\nof introspection.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, if we think of introspective awareness of\nexperience in the wrong way, the negative epistemic condition (that of\nbeing introspectively indiscriminible from a veridical perception) is\nread only as a condition on one\u2019s cognitive awareness, and not\nas a condition on experience itself. And Martin thinks that this lies\nbehind many of the objections to his account. In response, Martin\ntries to argue that read in the right way introspective\nindiscriminability guarantees that phenomenal consciousness is\npresent. For according to Martin, the disjunctivist should stress the\nconnection between phenomenal consciousness and having a point of\nview, or perspective on the world, a connection central to\nNagel\u2019s (1974) discussion of consciousness. So the negative\nepistemological condition when correctly interpreted will specify not\njust a subject\u2019s cognitive response to their circumstances, but\nrather their perspective on the world (which the introspective\nperspective coincides with), and this will be sufficient for there to\nbe something it is like for them to be so. It is worth noting that the\nreasons that Martin gives for recommending this account of\nhallucination appear to apply just in the case of a causally matching\nhallucination (i.e. a hallucination that is subjectively\nindistinguishable from a veridical perception and which involves the\nsame kind of proximate cause and brain state as that involved in the\ncorresponding veridical perception). Moreover, it is not obvious that\na disjunctivist needs to give the same account of all\nhallucinations. So if a disjunctivist were to agree to Martin\u2019s\nreasoning about causally matching hallucinations, it may be open to\nher to provide a positive account of other hallucinations.\n\n\nFish (2008 and 2009) proposes a rather different disjunctivist account\nof hallucination, which applies to all hallucinations, including\ncausally matching hallucinations. Fish offers what he calls a minimal,\nbut positive, story about hallucination. According to Fish, a\nmental state that may be intrinsically quite different from a veridical\nperception might come to be mistaken for a veridical perception and\ntherein acquire the status of hallucination. Fish thinks that\nthe demand for a more substantial intrinsic characterisation of\nhallucination is misguided, but that the following positive story can\nbe told. The indistinguishability of hallucination from veridical\nperception is grounded in the similarity of their effects. A\nhallucination of an x is a mental state that, whilst not\nbeing a veridical perception of an x, nevertheless comes to\nhave effects that are sufficiently similar to those a veridical\nperception would have had. If the subject is conceptually\nsophisticated these effects will include higher-order beliefs about\nseeing an x, or seeming to see an x.  If the subject\nis not sophisticated enough to have such beliefs at all, the effects\nwill be solely behavioural.\n\n\nThis account allows that hallucinations may have no phenomenal\ncharacter, and even in those cases in which the mental state does have\nphenomenal character, the phenomenal character it has may well not\naccount for the particular content of the hallucination. (For the\nsuggestion that the disjunctivist should accept this consequence, see\nSturgeon 2006 and 2008. For criticism of Fish\u2019s account, see\nSiegel 2008).\n",
