    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Evaluation\n5.4 Evaluation\n\nA moment of \u201cinsight\u201d can be misleading, as what initially\nstrikes you as a promising idea may ultimately turn out to be a dead\nend. You may have countless ideas in the course of undertaking a\ncomplex creative project, while only a few of them will make the final\ncut. A crucial part of your creative work therefore consists in\nevaluating your ideas. For any idea that occurs to you, you might have\nto ask: Will this work? Is it new? How does it fit in with other parts\nof your project? Do you have the resources and abilities to bring it\nto fruition? Is it worth the time and effort?\n\nMuch of the research on this phase of the creative process is\nconcerned to identify and categorize the range of factors that people\ntake into consider as they evaluate their ideas (Blair & Mumford\n2007; Dailey & Mumford, 2006). Unsurprisingly, those factors vary\nfrom one domain to another. New culinary dishes are judged by factors\nlike aroma, taste, texture, color, presentation (Horng & Lin\n2009), whereas improved musical performances are judged according to\ntheir complexity, originality, and technical virtuosity (Eisenberg\n& Thompson 2003), and so on. Your understanding of the relevant\nfactors is part of your internalized model of the domain (Bink &\nMarsh, 2000; Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer 1995). And since you\nacquired and refined that model through years of preparation, your\ncapacity for evaluation is largely a consequence of your efforts from\nthat initial stage.\n\nSomewhat more surprisingly, there is some evidence that people who are\ngood at evaluating ideas are also good at generating them (Runco 1991;\nRunco & Dow 2004; Runco & Chand 1994; Runco & Vega\n1990).\n\nOther studies support what Sawyer calls Sawyer (2012: 131) calls the\nproductivity theory, which says that the best way to get good\nideas is to have lots of ideas and just throw away the bad ones. In\nhistoriometric studies, Simonton found that creators who yielded the\ngreatest number of works over their lifetimes were mostly likely to\nproduce works that were significant and stood the test of time. Even\nmore striking, he discovered that, from year to year, the periods when\ncreators were most productive were also the ones in which they were\nmost likely to do exceptional work (Simonton 1988a, 1988b). Linus\nPauling, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 as well as the\nNobel Peace Prize in 1962, summed up the productivity theory in a\nfamous remark:\n\n\nIf you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them\nwill be wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away.\n(quoted by Crick 1995 [time 34:57])\n\n",
