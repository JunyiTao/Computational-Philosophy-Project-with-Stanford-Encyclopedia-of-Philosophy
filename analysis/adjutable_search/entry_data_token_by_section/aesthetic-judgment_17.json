    "main_text": "The Notion of the Aesthetic || Beauty and Sublimity\n4.4 Beauty and Sublimity\n\nOne notion that is hard to place among other aesthetic notions is that\nof sublimity. There is a long and venerable tradition of thinking that\nbeauty and sublimity share equal status as fundamental aesthetic\ncategories. Sublimity comes in different varieties. Kant distinguishes\n\u201cmathematically\u201d and \u201cdynamically\u201d sublime,\nroughly, corresponding to our sense of the enormity and power of\nthings. The fundamental question about beauty and sublimity is whether\nthey exclude each other. According to the long and venerable\ntradition, if something is sublime then it is not beautiful and vice\nversa. Many have conceived of sublimity such that it excludes beauty.\nBut this is questionable.\n\nIf we conceive of beauty narrowly, where it merely means a certain\nelegance and prettiness (as Levinson does in Levinson 2012), then that\nnarrow concept of beauty would be a substantive aesthetic property.\nThat notion of beauty may exclude sublimity. However, it is\nnot clear that there is reason to restrict beauty in this way. If, on\nthe contrary, beauty (or at least a concept of beauty) is a\ngeneric over-arching aesthetic value, then one suggestion would be\nthat sublimity should be understood as a kind of beauty. In\nthat case, it would turn out that it is sublimity that is a\nsubstantive aesthetic concept, not beauty. On that view, beauty and\nsublimity are not opposed to each other. Instead sublimity is a kind\nof magnificent beauty or a spectacular or extraordinary way of being\nbeautiful.\n\nEdmund Burke links sublimity with pain as well as pleasure, perhaps\ndrawing on Aristotle\u2019s idea of \u201ccatharsis\u201d (Burke\n1757). The idea seems to be that judgments of sublimity are grounded\non both pleasure and pain, whereas judgments of beauty are grounded\nonly on pleasure. While this may fit the aesthetic experience of wind\nand rain in a storm at sea or up a mountain, it does not fit the\nsublimity of the stars in the sky and sublime delicacy of a\nspider\u2019s web, where there is no exciting terror. So the pain\naccount is not generally true of the sublime.\n\nRichard Wagner claimed that there was musical sublimity in\nBeethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, and that was its great innovation,\nto take us beyond the merely musically-beautiful to the sublime\n(Wagner 1870, contrast Hanslick 1950, 1986). Many musicologists follow\nWagner, (such as Richard Taruskin [1989, 2019]). But on that view, if\nsublimity is associated with danger and extremity, it is not clear\nthat we have a plausible story of why people seek out the sublime in\nmusic. Is it a kind of thrill-seeking, like fairground rides or rock\nclimbing, where people believe themselves to be in danger or at least\ncannot help imagining that they are? Is their experience of\nBeethoven\u2019s Ninth mixed with pain in this way? This seems\nunlikely. Pain and fear have natural expressions on the human face,\nbut the human faces of audiences listening to Beethoven\u2019s Ninth\nare not noticeably different from the human faces listening to Mozart,\nChopin or Tchaikovsky. Their faces are unlike those of those on\nfairground rides or rock climbers who have to make difficult moves.\nFurthermore, the audience of the Ninth are not motivated to flee from\nthe concert hall. Do they have to be strapped into their seats to\nprevent escape as on a fairground ride (contra McClary 1991)? By\ncontrast, on the substantive view of the sublime as a kind of beauty,\nthere is a distinctive kind of pleasure that characterizes the\nexperience of the sublime, on which judgments of the sublime are\nbased. It is an intense pleasure, to be sure. But intensity does not\nentail a mixture with pain.\n\nSublimity in a representational art, such as painting, is a different\nmatter. John Martin\u2019s wonderful painting Apocalypse,\nfor example, does evoke a kind of terror, at least imagined terror. We\nmight plausibly say that this sublimity is not a kind of beauty, even\nthough it is certainly a kind of artistic excellence. What\nthis suggests is that we should avoid a unitary theory of the\nsublime. Some sublimity is a way of being beautiful, and some is\nnot.\n\nThe main downside of this view is that it breaks with one major strand\nof the intellectual tradition in thinking about the sublime in\nopposition to beauty. But it is hard to know much to weigh that\nif we are seeking a useful concept for organizing our experiences of\nart and nature.\n",
