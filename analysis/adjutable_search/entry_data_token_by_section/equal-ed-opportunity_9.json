    "main_text": "The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity || Debates about Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n3.5 Debates about Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nDebates about FEO have focused on the relative importance of the goods\nit regulates (i.e., access to offices and positions) and the fact that\nit regards inequalities in inborn potential as relevant obstacles\ngenerally, and in the education arena.\n\nIn A Theory of Justice, Rawls accords the fair equality of\nopportunity principle priority over access to other types of\nadvantages such as income and wealth. Disputing this priority, some\nhave argued that the opportunities that FEO regulates are not more\nimportant than these other goods and that we should prefer a principle\n(known, for example, in Rawls\u2019 work as the difference principle)\nthat ensures that the least advantaged are as well-off as possible in\nterms of income (or according to some critics, well-being) (Alexander\n1985; Arneson 1999; Clayton 2001; Miklosi 2010). Richard Arneson\npresses this complaint forcefully in his paper \u201cAgainst Rawlsian\nEquality of Opportunity\u201d. Rawls\u2019 argument for FEO over the\ndifference principle comes from a commitment to individuals\u2019\nself-respect and the contribution that the ability to compete for\noffices and social positions on fair terms make to that self-respect.\nBut Arneson argues that those among us with lesser capacities might\nreasonably reject according such weight to the self-respect of the\ntalented. After all, the self-respect derived from the results of a\n\u201cnatural lottery\u201d is unequally distributed. The untalented\namong us, Arneson argues, would prefer increases in well-being to a\nprinciple of self-respect that confers no benefit to them.\n\nIn terms of education, rather than ensuring that those with the same\ninborn talent potential and ambition have the same level of\neducational achievement, Arneson would emphasize that educational\nopportunities should aim at promoting the welfare of the least\nadvantaged. This is more important, as he sees it, than ensuring that\nfuture competitions for jobs are fairly structured. But Rawls and his\ndefenders have argued that wealth and welfare are different in kind\nfrom the goods that FEO regulates, and that FEO pertains to more\nimportant goods that are closely connected to autonomy, the social\nbases of self-respect, and what he calls the two moral powers. This\nexplains their priority and irreducibility (Taylor 2004; Shields 2015;\nShiffrin 2004). Further, if everyone had a decent minimum, then the\nadditional contribution of wealth to well-being is less significant.\nIn subsequent work however, Rawls does acknowledge that the priority\nof FEO over his difference principle may be less stringent than he\nthought.\n\nSome philosophers criticize FEO as insufficiently egalitarian. This\ncriticism has taken two forms. First, some claim that by making fair\nopportunities relative to motivation, FEO has insufficient bite in a\nnon-ideal world in which inequality frequently produces diminished\naspirations in the oppressed. If women have been socialized for\ncenturies to think that certain positions in society are beyond their\ncapacities, and accordingly they are not motivated to pursue such\npositions, does FEO have the resources to criticize this?\n\nA second objection points out that inequalities in social luck (e.g.,\nbeing born into a poor family, which FEO requires institutions to\ncorrect for) and inequalities in natural luck (e.g., being born with\nless talent potential, which FEO does not require institutions to\ncorrect for) should be treated the same. It is easy to think that both\ntypes of luck are equally arbitrary from a moral point of view, and\nthat this arbitrariness is a source of injustice. Indeed, some of\nRawls\u2019 own remarks seem to suggest this. Why, we might ask,\nshould educational institutions help close the gap between the\ntalented rich and talented poor but do nothing to close the gap\nbetween talented and untalented students, when being untalented is,\njust like social class, totally unavoidable. Matthew Clayton and\nRichard Arneson press this complaint against Rawls. Clayton claims\nthat Rawls\u2019 own reasoning appears to privilege consistency about\nboth types of luck. So Rawls should either accept a different\nprinciple applying to both natural and social luck, or else he must\ncondone a type of natural aristocracy for both talent and wealth.\n\nPart of a response to these objections would have to defend the\nresources that Rawlsian theory has for dealing with race and gender as\nobstacles to fair equality of opportunity as well as the importance of\nthe specific goods that FEO protects. Rawls himself singled out\ncertain goods as having a higher priority than the goods of income and\nwealth alone. In defense of Rawls on the first objection, Seana\nShiffrin (2004) has argued that FEO is a \u201crobust\nanti-discrimination principle\u201d, which should not be read out of\nits context within Rawls\u2019 two principles as a whole. Moreover,\nit\n\n\nwould be difficult to provide the sort of educational training\nnecessary to fulfill the principle\u2019s commands without thereby\nengaging in teaching that also combatted the stereotypes that produce\nsignificant differentiation of ambitions. (2004: 1650, fn31)\n\n\nOn her view, the social bases of self-respect require the robust\nanti-discrimination principle that FEO provides. In defense of Rawls\non the second objection, Robert Taylor (2004) has attempted to show\nthat self-realization has a crucial place in the hierarchy of goods on\nthe Kantian interpretation of Rawls\u2019 principles. He claims that\nFEO therefore has priority over the difference principle because it\nregulates goods that are more central to the exercise of our moral\npowers and our highest order interests. However, his defense of Rawls\nhas been criticized for being overly perfectionist and therefore not\npolitically liberal. If this criticism is sound, then it may seem to\nimply that while perfectionist Rawlsians can justify FEO, political\nliberal Rawlsians cannot. Liam Shields (2015) argues that there is a\nnon-perfectionist account of self-realization and that this leads us\nto supplement the principle of FEO with a principle of sufficient\nself-realization. This may be one way to defend FEO against those who\nfavor a strict focus on welfare.\n\nHowever, these responses would not satisfy those who believe that we\nshould adopt prioritarianism with respect to especially important\ngoods, distributing them in a way that gives priority to those who\nhave the least (Schouten 2012). Prioritarianism is a controversial\nview, and has some controversial implications for the distribution of\nK\u201312 education. For example, a prioritarian view might endorse\nproviding no state supported educational resources at all for those\nwho are extremely talented, unless it could be shown that doing so\nimproves the lot of the least well off. But many people will reject\nthis implication, believing that the state does have educational\nobligations to the talented in their own right. Prioritarianism is\nalso inattentive to inequalities that obtain elsewhere in the\ndistributional scheme, for example, between those at the median and\nthose at the very top. Many egalitarians will be disturbed by\ndisproportionate opportunities going to the top 1%, even if the very\nbottom of the distribution is improved. Rawls\u2019 view is not a\nsimple prioritarian one, but instead endorses a complex set of\nprinciples\u2014some of which are egalitarian such as FEO, and some\nof which give special attention to the least well off, such as the\ndifference principle.\n\nA final issue with FEO concerns our understanding of, and ability to\ndetermine, natural levels of talent. It can be very hard to know who\nhas the most potential even when children are well into their\nschooling. This suggests that it is not an appropriate or feasible\nbenchmark for the regulation of social institutions since we could\nnever know whether it was satisfied (Gomberg 1975). In addition, the\nfocus on natural talents has led some to consider the interaction\nbetween epigenetic traits and social environmental factors, calling\ninto question the integrity of this distinction. This expands our\nsense of the arbitrariness of natural inequalities and may provide\nimportant insights on how to redress these inequalities (Loi, Del\nSavio and Stupka 2013).\n",
