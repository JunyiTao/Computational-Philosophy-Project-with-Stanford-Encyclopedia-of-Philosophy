    "main_text": "al-Kindi\n1. al-Kindi\n\nThe traces of the \u2018influence\u2019 of al-Kindi (796-866) on\nMedieval Judaic thought appear to have been rather scanty, apart from\nsome quotations and passages surely taken from his works, and from one\nof them in particular; in any case they appeared to have been\nsubstantially limited to the first period of it, when the influence of\nNeoplatonism (or, better, of the first Arab-Islamic Aristotelianism,\nwhere a key role was played by Plotinus and Proclus as interpreters of\nmetaphysics) shows to have been stronger. As a matter of fact, rather\nthan speaking of al-Kindi\u2019s influence on Judaic thought, one\nshould speak of a sort of Jewish \u201cKindism\u201d through the\ninfluence of some of al-Kindi\u2019s Arabic (in particular Christian\nArabic) followers (see below, 11).\n\nThe first traces of al-Kindi\u2019s influence have been found in\nJacob al-Qirqisani, a Karaite Jewish author living in Mesopotamia\n(where al-Kindi himself was living one century before) in the first\nhalf of the 10th century. In al-Qirqisani\u2019s main\npublished non-philosophical work, the Book On the Lights and\nOn the Guard Towers (Kitab al-anwar wa-l-maraqib), a\nstudy of the legal parts of the Pentateuch, Georges Vajda identified\nsome passages of al-Kindi\u2019s Epistle On the Quiddity of the\nSleep and the Vision (Risala fi mahiyya al-nawm\nwa-l-ru\u2019ya), who al-Qirqisani would have employed for his\ndescription of the concept of \u201csleep\u201d (Vajda\n1941\u20131945, 115\u2013122). Other traces of a philosophical work\nby al-Kindi, his Epistle On the Cause Producing Ebb and Flow\n(Risala fi l-\u2018illa al-fa\u2018ila li-l-madd\nwa-l-jazr), have been found by Bruno Chiesa in a passage about\nthe world\u2019s creation in al-Qirqisani\u2019s most important (and\nstill unpublished) theological-philosophical work, the Book of\nGardens (Kitab al-riyad), a study of the non-legal parts\nof the Pentateuch (Chiesa 1989, 95). Of course, a complete analysis of\nal-Qirqisani\u2019s own \u201cphilosophy\u201d, as found in the\nlatter work, is still needed, so that the real force of\nal-Kindi\u2019s influence on his thought can be evaluated.\n\nAfter al-Qirqisani, other traces of al-Kindi\u2019s philosophical\ninfluence can be found in later Jewish thinkers. The most important of\nthem appears in Isaac Israeli, living in Egypt and Tunisia between ca.\n850 and 950 (according to other scholars, between ca. 830 and 932).\nOne of Israeli\u2019s main philosophical works, his Book of\nDefinitions (Kitab al-hudud), is substantially a Jewish\nadaptation of al-Kindi\u2019s work on the same subject, the\nEpistle On Definitions and Descriptions of Things (Risala\nfi hudud al-ashya\u2019 wa-rusumiha): Israeli adapted to the\nJewish readers and sometimes commented on a number of al-Kindi\u2019s\nown definitions of philosophical and theological terms \u2013 as it\nhas been shown by Samuel Miklos Stern (Altmann and Stern 1958,\n3\u201378). Israeli\u2019s employment of al-Kindi\u2019s philosophy\nfor building his own philosophical work appears to be the most\nrelevant case of al-Kindi\u2019s influence on Medieval Jewish\nphilosophy. A second case is that of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera\n(1225\u20131295 circa), a Spanish Jewish philosopher who wrote a\nnumber of works by fitting quotations (translated into Hebrew and\noccasionally adapted by him to his own use) from many Arabic sources:\nin his Balm for Sorrow (Seri ha-yagon), he was\nstrongly influenced by, and inserted a number of quotations from,\nal-Kindi\u2019s On the Way of Dispelling Worry (Fi hila\nli-daf\u2018 al-ahzan), as proved by a number of scholars\n(Ritter and Walzer 1938 [1943], Klugman-Barkan 1971). Apart from these\ntwo cases, only very scanty traces of the knowledge of\nal-Kindi\u2019s work have been found in Medieval Jewish philosophy:\none can mention a reference to al-Kindi\u2019s zoology found in Moses\nIbn Ezra\u2019s still unpublished philosophic-philological work, the\nTreatise of the Garden On the Metaphorical and the True Meanings\n(of the Bible) (Maqala al-hadiqa fi ma\u2018na l-majaz\nwa-l-haqiqa), written in Christian Spain around 1130 (see ms. of\nJerusalem, Jewish National and University Library, 8\u00b0 570, pages\n206, line 8 \u2013 207, line 7).\n",
