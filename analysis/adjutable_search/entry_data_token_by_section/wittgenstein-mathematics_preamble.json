    "main_text": "\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics is undoubtedly\nthe most unknown and under-appreciated part of his philosophical opus.\nIndeed, more than half of Wittgenstein\u2019s writings from 1929\nthrough 1944 are devoted to mathematics, a fact that Wittgenstein\nhimself emphasized in 1944 by writing that his \u201cchief\ncontribution has been in the philosophy of mathematics\u201d (Monk\n1990: 466).\n\nThe core of Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of mathematics is very\nmuch set by the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922;\nhereafter Tractatus), where his main aim is to work out the\nlanguage-reality connection by determining what is required for\nlanguage, or language usage, to be about the world.\nWittgenstein answers this question, in part, by asserting that the\nonly genuine propositions that we can use to make assertions about\nreality are contingent (\u2018empirical\u2019) propositions, which\nare true if they agree with reality and false otherwise (4.022, 4.25,\n4.062, 2.222). From this it follows that all other apparent\npropositions are pseudo-propositions of various types and that all\nother uses of \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 deviate\nmarkedly from the truth-by-correspondence (or agreement) that\ncontingent propositions have in relation to reality. Thus, from the\nTractatus to at least 1944, Wittgenstein maintains that\n\u201cmathematical propositions\u201d are not real propositions and\nthat \u201cmathematical truth\u201d is essentially non-referential\nand purely syntactical in nature. On Wittgenstein\u2019s view, we\ninvent mathematical calculi and we expand mathematics by calculation\nand proof, and though we learn from a proof that a theorem\ncan be derived from axioms by means of certain rules in a\nparticular way, it is not the case that this proof-path\npre-exists our construction of it.\n\nAs we shall see, Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics begins\nin a rudimentary way in the Tractatus, develops into a\nfinitistic constructivism in the middle period (Philosophical\nRemarks (1929\u201330) and Philosophical Grammar\n(1931\u201333), respectively; hereafter PR and PG,\nrespectively), and is further developed in new and old directions in\nthe manuscripts used for\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (1937\u201344;\nhereafter RFM). As Wittgenstein\u2019s substantive views on\nmathematics evolve from 1918 through 1944, his writing and\nphilosophical styles evolve from the assertoric, aphoristic\nstyle of the Tractatus to a clearer, argumentative style in\nthe middle period, to a dialectical, interlocutory style in\nRFM and the Philosophical Investigations (hereafter\nPI).\n",
