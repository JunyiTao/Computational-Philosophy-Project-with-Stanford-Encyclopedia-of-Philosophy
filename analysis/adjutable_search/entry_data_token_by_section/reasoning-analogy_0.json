They have been\nemployed, in a wide variety of settings and with considerable success,\nto generate insight and to formulate possible solutions to problems.\nAccording to Joseph Priestley, a pioneer in chemistry and\nelectricity,\n\n\nanalogy is our best guide in all philosophical investigations; and all\ndiscoveries, which were not made by mere accident, have been made by\nthe help of it. (1769/1966: 14)\n\n\nPriestley may be over-stating the case, but there is no doubt that\nanalogies have suggested fruitful lines of inquiry in many fields.\nBecause of their heuristic value, analogies and analogical reasoning\nhave been a particular focus of AI research. H\u00e1jek (2018)\nexamines analogy as a heuristic tool in philosophy.\n\nAnalogies have a related (and not entirely separable)\njustificatory role. This role is most obvious where an\nanalogical argument is explicitly offered in support of some\nconclusion. The intended degree of support for the conclusion can vary\nconsiderably. At one extreme, these arguments can be strongly\npredictive. For example:\n\n\nExample 1.\nHydrodynamic analogies exploit mathematical similarities\nbetween the equations governing ideal fluid flow and torsional\nproblems. To predict stresses in a planned structure, one can\nconstruct a fluid model, i.e., a system of pipes through which water\npasses (Timoshenko and Goodier 1970). Within the limits of\nidealization, such analogies allow us to make demonstrative\ninferences, for example, from a measured quantity in the fluid model\nto the analogous value in the torsional problem. In practice, there\nare numerous complications (Sterrett 2006).\n\nAt the other extreme, an analogical argument may provide very weak\nsupport for its conclusion, establishing no more than minimal\nplausibility. Consider:\n\nExample 2.\n Thomas Reid\u2019s (1785) argument for the existence of life on\nother planets (Stebbing 1933; Mill 1843/1930; Robinson 1930; Copi\n1961). Reid notes a number of similarities between Earth and the other\nplanets in our solar system: all orbit and are illuminated by the sun;\nseveral have moons; all revolve on an axis. In consequence, he\nconcludes, it is \u201cnot unreasonable to think, that those planets\nmay, like our earth, be the habitation of various orders of living\ncreatures\u201d (1785: 24).\n\nSuch modesty is not uncommon. Often the point of an analogical\nargument is just to persuade people to take an idea seriously. For\ninstance:\n\n\nExample 3.\n Darwin takes himself to be using an analogy between artificial and\nnatural selection to argue for the plausibility of the latter:\n\n\nWhy may I not invent the hypothesis of Natural Selection (which from\nthe analogy of domestic productions, and from what we know of the\nstruggle of existence and of the variability of organic beings, is, in\nsome very slight degree, in itself probable) and try whether this\nhypothesis of Natural Selection does not explain (as I think it does)\na large number of facts\u2026. (Letter to Henslow, May 1860\nin Darwin 1903)\n\n\nHere it appears, by Darwin\u2019s own admission, that his analogy is\nemployed to show that the hypothesis is probable to some \u201cslight\ndegree\u201d and thus merits further investigation. Some, however,\nreject this characterization of Darwin\u2019s reasoning (Richards\n1997; Gildenhuys 2004).\n\n\nSometimes analogical reasoning is the only available form of\njustification for a hypothesis. The method of ethnographic\nanalogy is used to interpret\n\n\nthe nonobservable behaviour of the ancient inhabitants of an\narchaeological site (or ancient culture) based on the similarity of\ntheir artifacts to those used by living peoples. (Hunter and Whitten\n1976: 147)\n\n\nFor example:\n\nExample 4.\n Shelley (1999, 2003) describes how ethnographic analogy was used to\ndetermine the probable significance of odd markings on the necks of\nMoche clay pots found in the Peruvian Andes. Contemporary potters in\nPeru use these marks (called s\u00edgnales) to indicate\nownership; the marks enable them to reclaim their work when several\npotters share a kiln or storage facility. Analogical reasoning may be\nthe only avenue of inference to the past in such cases, though this\npoint is subject to dispute (Gould and Watson 1982; Wylie 1982, 1985).\nAnalogical reasoning may have similar significance for cosmological\nphenomena that are inaccessible due to limits on observation\n(Dardashti et al. 2017). See\n \u00a75.1\n for further discussion.\n\nAs philosophers and historians such as Kuhn (1996) have repeatedly\npointed out, there is not always a clear separation between the two\nroles that we have identified, discovery and justification. Indeed,\nthe two functions are blended in what we might call the\nprogrammatic (or paradigmatic) role of analogy: over\na period of time, an analogy can shape the development of a program of\nresearch. For example:\n\n\nExample 5.\n An \u2018acoustical analogy\u2019 was employed for many years by\ncertain nineteenth-century physicists investigating spectral lines.\nDiscrete spectra were thought to be\n\n\ncompletely analogous to the acoustical situation, with atoms (and/or\nmolecules) serving as oscillators originating or absorbing the\nvibrations in the manner of resonant tuning forks. (Maier 1981:\n51)\n\n\nGuided by this analogy, physicists looked for groups of spectral lines\nthat exhibited frequency patterns characteristic of a harmonic\noscillator. This analogy served not only to underwrite the\nplausibility of conjectures, but also to guide and limit\ndiscovery by pointing scientists in certain directions.\n\n\nMore generally, analogies can play an important programmatic role by\nguiding conceptual development (see\n \u00a75.2).\n In some cases, a programmatic analogy culminates in the theoretical\nunification of two different areas of inquiry.\n\nExample 6.\n Descartes\u2019s (1637/1954) correlation between geometry and\nalgebra provided methods for systematically handling geometrical\nproblems that had long been recognized as analogous. A very different\nrelationship between analogy and discovery exists when a programmatic\nanalogy breaks down, as was the ultimate fate of the acoustical\nanalogy. That atomic spectra have an entirely different explanation\nbecame clear with the advent of quantum theory. In this case, novel\ndiscoveries emerged against background expectations shaped by\nthe guiding analogy. There is a third possibility: an unproductive or\nmisleading programmatic analogy may simply become entrenched and\nself-perpetuating as it leads us to \u201cconstruct\u2026 data that\nconform to it\u201d (Stepan 1996: 133). Arguably, the danger of this\nthird possibility provides strong motivation for developing a critical\naccount of analogical reasoning and analogical arguments.\n\nAnalogical cognition, which embraces all cognitive processes\ninvolved in discovering, constructing and using analogies, is broader\nthan analogical reasoning (Hofstadter 2001; Hofstadter and Sander\n2013). Understanding these processes is an important objective of\ncurrent cognitive science research, and an objective that generates\nmany questions. How do humans identify analogies? Do nonhuman animals\nuse analogies in ways similar to humans? How do analogies and\nmetaphors influence concept formation?\n\nThis entry, however, concentrates specifically on analogical\narguments. Specifically, it focuses on three central epistemological\nquestions:\n\nWhat criteria should we use to evaluate analogical arguments?\nWhat philosophical justification can be provided for analogical\ninferences?\nHow do analogical arguments fit into a broader inferential context\n(i.e., how do we combine them with other forms of inference),\nespecially theoretical confirmation?\n\n\nFollowing a preliminary discussion of the basic structure of\nanalogical arguments, the entry reviews selected attempts to provide\nanswers to these three questions. To find such answers would\nconstitute an important first step towards understanding the nature of\nanalogical reasoning. To isolate these questions, however, is to make\nthe non-trivial assumption that there can be a theory of\nanalogical arguments\u2014an assumption which, as we shall\nsee, is attacked in different ways by both philosophers and cognitive\nscientists.\n",
