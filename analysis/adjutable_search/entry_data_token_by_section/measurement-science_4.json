    "main_text": "Mathematical Theories of Measurement (\u201cMeasurement Theory\u201d) || The classification of scales\n3.2 The classification of scales\n\nThe previous subsection discussed the axiomatization of empirical\nstructures, a line of inquiry that dates back to the early days of\nmeasurement theory. A complementary line of inquiry within measurement\ntheory concerns the classification of measurement scales. The\npsychophysicist S.S. Stevens (1946, 1951) distinguished among four\ntypes of scales: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. Nominal scales\nrepresent objects as belonging to classes that have no particular\norder, e.g., male and female. Ordinal scales represent order but no\nfurther algebraic structure. For example, the Mohs scale of mineral\nhardness represents minerals with numbers ranging from 1 (softest) to\n10 (hardest), but there is no empirical significance to equality among\nintervals or ratios of those\n numbers.[5]\n Celsius and Fahrenheit are examples of interval scales: they\nrepresent equality or inequality among intervals of temperature, but\nnot ratios of temperature, because their zero points are arbitrary.\nThe Kelvin scale, by contrast, is a ratio scale, as are the familiar\nscales representing mass in kilograms, length in meters and duration\nin seconds. Stevens later refined this classification and\ndistinguished between linear and logarithmic interval scales (1959:\n31\u201334) and between ratio scales with and without a natural unit\n(1959: 34). Ratio scales with a natural unit, such as those used for\ncounting discrete objects and for representing probabilities, were\nnamed \u201cabsolute\u201d scales.\n\nAs Stevens notes, scale types are individuated by the families of\ntransformations they can undergo without loss of empirical\ninformation. Empirical relations represented on ratio scales, for\nexample, are invariant under multiplication by a positive number,\ne.g., multiplication by 2.54 converts from inches to centimeters.\nLinear interval scales allow both multiplication by a positive number\nand a constant shift, e.g., the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit\nin accordance with the formula \u00b0C \u00d7 9/5 + 32 = \u00b0F.\nOrdinal scales admit of any transformation function as long as it is\nmonotonic and increasing, and nominal scales admit of any one-to-one\nsubstitution. Absolute scales admit of no transformation other than\nidentity. Stevens\u2019 classification of scales was later\ngeneralized by Louis Narens (1981, 1985: Ch. 2) and Luce et al. (1990:\nCh. 20) in terms of the homogeneity and uniqueness of the relevant\ntransformation groups.\n\nWhile Stevens\u2019 classification of scales met with general\napproval in scientific and philosophical circles, its wider\nimplications for measurement theory became the topic of considerable\ndebate. Two issues were especially contested. The first was whether\nclassification and ordering operations deserve to be called\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d operations, and accordingly whether the\nrepresentation of magnitudes on nominal and ordinal scales should\ncount as measurement. Several physicists, including Campbell, argued\nthat classification and ordering operations did not provide a\nsufficiently rich structure to warrant the use of numbers, and hence\nshould not count as measurement operations. The second contested issue\nwas whether a concatenation operation had to be found for a magnitude\nbefore it could be fundamentally measured on a ratio scale. The debate\nbecame especially heated when it re-ignited a longer controversy\nsurrounding the measurability of intensities of sensation. It is to\nthis debate we now turn.\n",
