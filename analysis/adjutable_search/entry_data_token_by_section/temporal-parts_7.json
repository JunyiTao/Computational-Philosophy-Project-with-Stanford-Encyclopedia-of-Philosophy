    "main_text": "Time and Temporal Parts\n6. Time and Temporal Parts\n\nAs well as disagreeing about whether persisting things have temporal\nparts, philosophers disagree about the nature of time itself. Does\ntime flow? Are the past and the future as real as the present?\nPhilosophers also disagree about the connection between these\ndisagreements: does taking a certain view about the nature of time\ncommit you to any particular view about the existence of temporal\nparts? What about vice versa?\n\nYou can find a more detailed discussion of the nature of time\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the separate entry on\n time).\n The most relevant debate for our purposes turns on whether distant\ntimes are like distant places. For example, people, objects and places\nin Antarctica exist, even though they are far away (if you are reading\nthis in Antarctica, please adjust the example). It can be difficult to\ncommunicate with distant places, and they may be less important to us\nthan our immediate surroundings, but they exist nevertheless. What\nabout eighteenth-century people, objects and times? Does David Hume\nexist, despite being far away in time? Or is it more reasonable to say\nthat Hume used to exist, but now does not exist?\u00a0 Eternalists\nbelieve that past and future things exist, just like present things.\nPresentists, in contrast, believe that distant times are not like\ndistant places: things in distant places exist, but things at distant\ntimes do not. According to the intermediate \u2018growing\nuniverse\u2019 theory, past and present things exist, but future\nthings do not.\n\nWhat connection is there between the eternalism-presentism debate, and\nthe debate about temporal parts? It\u2019s natural to suppose that\npresentists should be endurantists, claiming that things are wholly\npresent whenever they exist. If you don\u2019t believe in either the\npast or the future, there\u2019s nowhere and nowhen for any\n\u2018missing\u2019 parts to be. This argument from presentism to\nendurantism needs some work, however. Presentists think that only the\npresent exists, but they\u2019re happy for us to talk about the\ncauses of the First World War, about next week\u2019s seminar, or\nabout David Hume. Although Hume does not exist, it\u2019s right to\nsay that David Hume wrote An Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, and wrong to say that David Hume wrote The\nFeminine Mystique. Presentists worth their salt provide a story\nabout what makes certain statements about the past and the future\nright, and others wrong. Can presentists claim that, although past and\nfuture temporal parts of the banana do not exist, the banana did have\ntemporal parts in the past, and will have other temporal parts in the\nfuture? This takes us back to the question of how to define\n\u2018temporal part\u2019 (see\n section 2),\n and it raises a methodological issue: should \u2018temporal\npart\u2019 be defined in such a way that presentists can believe in\ntemporal parts, or not?\n\nWell, perhaps presentists should reject temporal parts and so be\nendurantists. Must eternalists, who believe in the past and the\nfuture, accept temporal parts and so be perdurantists? Or are\neternalists free to choose between endurantism and perdurantism?\u00a0\nOne reason to think that eternalists should believe in temporal parts\nis that without them they may have difficulty explaining how things\nchange. How can you both know about theories of persistence (tomorrow)\nand fail to know about theories of persistence (yesterday)?\nPresentists don\u2019t seem to have a problem here: your failure\nyesterday to know about theories of persistence just doesn\u2019t\nexist. But eternalists are committed to the existence of your two\napparently-conflicting states. If eternalists accept temporal parts,\nthey have a neat explanation at hand: your yesterday temporal part\ndoesn\u2019t know about theories of persistence, but your tomorrow\npart does know about theories of persistence. But if eternalists\nreject temporal parts, then the two apparently-conflicting states are\nstates of one and the same thing (you), and it\u2019s not obvious how\nto resolve the conflict. So perhaps eternalists should believe in\ntemporal parts, and, conversely, those who reject temporal parts\nshould be presentists. This argument succeeds only if eternalists\nreally can\u2019t explain change without believing in temporal parts\n(see\n section 3).\n\nIf we could establish that things have temporal parts if and only if\nthe past and the future exist, this would raise a number of issues.\nFirst, should we attempt to establish a theory of persistence, and\nthen let this dictate our theory of time? Or should we start with the\ntheory of time? (See\n section 7\n for an argument from physics against presentism and thus, perhaps,\nagainst endurantism.) Or can we somehow establish both at once?\nSecond, tying the dispute about persistence to the dispute about time\nmakes trouble for anyone who thinks that one of the disputes is\ngenuine but the other is merely a verbal disagreement. And, third,\nsince presentism and eternalism seem clearly to be incompatible, if\neach compels a different account of persistence, then there\ncan\u2019t be \u2018mixed\u2019 worlds in which some things perdure\nand others endure (a peculiar consequence, since most endurantists\nthink that processes perdure).\n\nAttempts to connect debates about time with debates about persistence\nhave focused on the disagreement between eternalists and presentists.\nBut there is another dispute about time which may have some bearing on\nwhether things have temporal parts. Eternalists agree that past,\npresent and future times all exist, but they disagree amongst\nthemselves as to whether there are important ontological differences\nbetween the three categories. Advocates of the \u2018A-theory\u2019\nof time argue that the flow of time pushes events from one ontological\nstatus to another (presentists are usually taken to be A-theorists\ntoo). But advocates of the \u2018B-theory\u2019 of time think that\nthere is no important ontological difference between past, present and\nfuture, and that there is no such thing as \u2018the flow of\ntime\u2019. There is some tendency to think that the A-theory is more\nhospitable to endurantism, and the B-theory more hospitable to\nperdurantism, but there is no consensus on this matter.\n\nFinally, considerations about the possibility of time-travel have been\nused to argue both for and against the existence of temporal parts;\nthese arguments connect with debate about whether we should approach\npersistence as an issue about parthood and/or as an issue about\nlocation. For more on this debate, see section 4.2 of the separate\nentry on\n Time Travel,\n and section 6.3.5 of the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology.\n\nSuggested Reading: Earlier discussions of temporal\nparts paid close attention to analogies and disanalogies between space\nand time: e.g. Taylor (1955), Meiland (1966); Butterfield (1985)\nreflects on these. Lombard (1999) and Brogaard (2000) argue that\npresentism is compatible with perdurantism, while Merricks (1995) and\nHestevold and Carter (2002) argue that presentism compels endurantism.\nBenovsky (2009) takes an even-handed approach. Merricks (1995) and\nHinchliff (1996) argue that eternalism rules out endurantism, because\nof the problem of change; see the suggested reading at the end of\n section 3\n for endurance-friendly eternalist accounts of change. Lowe (1998a)\nargues for a connection between theories of time and theories of\npersistence. Markosian (1994) attempts to formulate the\nendurance-perdurance debate in a way which is independent of the\neternalism/presentism debate. Mellor (1981; 1998) and Johnston (1987)\ncombine eternalism and endurantism, whilst Ingthorsson (2009) opposes\nthis combination, and Pezet (2019) favours endurance with presentism.\nTallant (2018) argues that presentism is incompatible with each of\nperdurantism, endurantism, and stage theory; responses include Baron\n(2019), Noonan (2019), Iaquinto (2019), and Hochstetter and Hess\n(2020). For discussion of the relationship between the A/B-theory\ndebate and the debate about persistence, see Butterfield (1985),\nOaklander (1992), Wilson (1955), and Carter and Hestevold (1994).\nParsons (2005) highlights a semantic problem for B-theory\nperdurantists. Barker and Dowe (2003) criticise endurantism by drawing\non rival theories of time; McDaniel (2003) and Beebee and Rush (2003)\nrespond, provoking Barker and Dowe (2005); see also Benovsky (2009a).\nFollowing Sider (2001), Effingham and Robson (2007) argue that\nendurantism cannot account for the possibility of time travel, as does\nSimon (2005), whilst Miller (2006a) defends endurantism; Gilmore\n(2007) and Effingham (2011a) argue that time travel is a problem for\nperdurantism. See also Effingham (2010) and Daniels (2014). Wasserman\n(2017: chapter 6) sets this discussion in the context of wider debates\nabout time travel; Proetti and Smid (2019) are sceptical about time\ntravel arguments here. See also Mooney (2019a, 2019b), Valaris and\nMichael (2015). Gilmore et al (2016) consider other connections\nbetween the metaphysics of time and debates about persistence.\n",
