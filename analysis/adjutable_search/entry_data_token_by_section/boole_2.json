The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)\n\nIn New Light on George Boole (2018) by MacHale and Cohen one\nfinds, published for the first time, (an edited version of) the\nbiography by MaryAnn Boole (1818\u20131887) of her famous brother,\nand on p. 41 there is the following passage:\n \nHe told me that from boyhood he had had the conviction that Logic\ncould be reduced to a mathematical science, and that he had often made\nhimself ill on the attempt to prove it, but it was not until 1847 that\nthe true method flashed upon him.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s final path to logic fame occurred in a curious way. In\nearly 1847 he was stimulated to renew his investigations into logic by\na trivial but very public dispute between De Morgan and the Scottish\nphilosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788\u20131856)\u2014not to be\nconfused with his contemporary the Irish mathematician Sir William\nRowan Hamilton (1805\u20131865). This dispute revolved around who\ndeserved credit for the idea of quantifying the predicate (e.g.,\nAll \\(A\\) is all \\(B\\), All \\(A\\) is some \\(B\\),\netc.). MaryAnn wrote that when the true method flashed upon him in\n1847, \u201che was literally like a man dazzled with excess of\nlight\u201d.  Within a few months Boole had written his 82 page\nmonograph, Mathematical Analysis of Logic, first presenting\nan algebraic approach to Aristotelian logic, then looking briefly at\nthe general theory. (Some say that this monograph and De\nMorgan\u2019s book Formal Logic appeared on the same day in\nNovember 1847.)\n\nWe are not told what the true method was that flashed upon Boole. One\npossibility is the discovery of the Expansion Theorem and the\nproperties of constituents.\n",
