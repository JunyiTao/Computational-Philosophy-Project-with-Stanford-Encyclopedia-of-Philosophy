    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Paternalism\n3.7 Paternalism\n\nInsofar as Mill insists that preventing harm to others is the only\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberty, he is committed\nto a blanket prohibition on paternalism. Why? Mill offers two explicit\nreasons.\n\nFirst, state power is liable to abuse. Politicians are self-interested\nand corruptible and will use a paternalistic license to limit the\nfreedom of citizens in ways that promote their own interests and not\nthose of the citizens whose liberty they restrict (V 20\u20133).\n\nSecond, even well intentioned rulers will misidentify the good of\ncitizens. Because an agent is a more reliable judge of his own good,\neven well intentioned rulers will promote the good of the citizens\nless well than would the citizens themselves (IV 4, 12).\n\nThese are reasonably strong consequentialist arguments against giving\nthe state a broad discretionary power to engage in paternalistic\nlegislation whenever it sees fit. However, they do not support a\ncategorical ban on paternalism. In particular, these arguments provide\nno principled objection to paternalism\u2014no objection to\nsuccessful paternalistic restrictions on B\u2019s\nliberty that do in fact benefit B. This weakness in\nMill\u2019s explicit argument against paternalism is like the\nweakness in his truth-tracking defense of freedom of expression. Just\nas that argument provided no objection to successful censorship\n(censorship of all and only false belief), so too this argument\nprovides no objection to successful paternalism (A\u2019s\nrestrictions on B\u2019s liberty that do benefit\nB). Perhaps some who object to paternalism are only concerned\nwith unsuccessful paternalism. But many would have doubts about\nsuccessful paternalism. For it is common to think that individuals\nhave a right to make choices in their own personal affairs and that\nthis includes a right to make choices that are imprudent.\n\nHowever, Mill\u2019s perfectionist conception of happiness provides a\nmore robust rationale against paternalism. For if a person\u2019s\nhappiness depends on her exercise of the capacities that make her a\nresponsible agent, then a principal ingredient of her own good must\ninclude opportunities for responsible choice and self-determination.\nBut then it becomes clear how autonomy is an important part of a\nperson\u2019s good and how paternalism undercuts her good in\nimportant and predictable ways. Mill may still not have an argument\nagainst successful paternalism, but his perfectionism gives him an\nargument that successful paternalism is much harder to achieve than\none might have thought, because it is very hard to benefit an\nautonomous agent in ways that bypass her agency.\n\nDespite Mill\u2019s blanket prohibitions on paternalism, he does not\n(consistently) reject paternalism per se. For instance, he is\nforced to qualify his blanket prohibition on paternalism in order to\nmaintain his claim that no one should be free to sell himself into\nslavery.\n\n\nThe ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his\nown lot is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case.\n\u2026 [B]y selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty;\nhe foregoes any future use of it beyond that single act. He,\ntherefore, defeats in his own case, the very purpose which is the\njustification of allowing him to dispose of himself. (V 11)\n\n\nBecause it is the importance of exercising one\u2019s deliberative\ncapacities that explains the importance of certain liberties, the\nusual reason for recognizing liberties provides an argument against\nextending liberties to do things that will permanently undermine\none\u2019s future exercise of those same capacities. In this case, an\nexception to the usual prohibition on paternalism is motivated by\nappeal to the very same deliberative values that explain the usual\nprohibition. So this seems to be a principled exception to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism. We might call these autonomy-enhancing\nforms of paternalism.\n\nMill claims that the reasons for allowing paternalism in \u201cthis\nextreme case\u201d are \u201cevidently of far wider\napplication\u201d (V 11). That raises the question of what other\nforms of paternalism might be justified as principled exceptions to\nthe usual prohibition on paternalism. Unfortunately, Mill does not\ndirectly address this question. However, in a nearby passage Mill does\nrefer to the \u201calmost despotic power of husbands over\nwives\u201d (V 12). We might see Mill likening a wife\u2019s consent\nto marriage, in which she must surrender various rights of control\nover herself and her children, to someone contracting herself into\nslavery. This, of course, is a theme that he develops in The\nSubjection of Women (discussed below).\n",
