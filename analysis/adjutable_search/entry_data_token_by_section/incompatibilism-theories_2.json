    "main_text": "Noncausal Theories || Reason-Explanation\n1.2 Reason-Explanation\n\nThe second challenge facing non-causal theories of free will concerns\nacting for a reason. Free actions can be (and commonly are) done for\nreasons. An action performed for a reason is something for which there\nis a true reason-explanation. It is often objected that noncausal\ntheories of free will cannot provide an adequate account of this\nphenomenon.\n\nAccounts of acting for a reason and of reason-explanation often appeal\nto causation. An agent acts for a certain reason, it is said, only if\nthe agent\u2019s recognizing that reason causes, in an appropriate\nway, the agent\u2019s behavior; and citing a reason contributes to a\n(true) reason-explanation of an action only if the agent\u2019s\nrecognizing that reason caused the action in an appropriate way.\nProponents of noncausal theories generally go for one or another of\ntwo alternative accounts, appealing either to the content of an\nintention that the agent is said to have concurrently with performing\nthe action, or to the intentional content of the action itself.\n\nTo examine the first of these strategies, suppose that S wants her\nglasses, which she has left in her friend T\u2019s room, where he is\nnow sleeping. S also wants to wake T, because she desires his company,\nbut she knows that T needs some sleep, and hence she desires, too, not\nto wake him. S decides to enter T\u2019s room and does so, believing\nas she does that her action will contribute to the satisfaction of\nboth the desire to get her glasses and the desire to wake T. (The\nexample is adapted from Ginet 1990: 145.) What further facts about the\nsituation could make it the case that, in entering the room, S acts on\nher desire to get her glasses, and that citing that desire provides a\ntrue reason-explanation of her action, while she does not act on her\ndesire to wake T, and citing this latter desire does not give us a\ntrue reason-explanation of what she is doing?\n\nGinet\u2019s account of reason-explanations that cite antecedent\ndesires (1990: 143) implies that the following conditions suffice for\nthe truth of the explanation that cites S\u2019s desire to get her\nglasses:\n\n(a) prior to entering the room, S had a desire to get her\nglasses, and\n\n\n(b) concurrently with entering the room, S remembers that\nprior desire and intends of her entering the room that it satisfy (or\ncontribute to satisfying) that desire.\n\n\nGiven the indicated circumstances, citing S\u2019s desire to wake T\nwill fail to give us a true reason-explanation, Ginet holds, just in\ncase S does not intend of her action that it satisfy (or contribute to\nsatisfying) that desire.\n\nSeveral objections can be raised against this account. Suppose that,\nalthough conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled as S enters the room,\nher desire to get her glasses plays no role at all in bringing about\n(causing) her entry, while her desire to wake T, of which she is fully\naware when she acts, does play such a role. Causalists (e.g., Mele\n1992: ch. 13) will then deny that S really acts on her desire to get\nher glasses and that citing it truly explains her action. Indeed, even\nsome noncausalists deny that having a concurrent intention of the sort\nrequired by Ginet (together with awareness of the antecedent desire)\nsuffices for acting for the reason in question. As McCann (1998: 163)\nsuggests, one might have such an intention but fail to carry it out.\nAn account that requires a concurrent intention of this sort, then,\nwill need to provide for its implementation.\n\nTwo further problems attend the concurrent intention that is required.\nFirst, the required intention is a second-order attitude, an attitude\nabout (among other things) another of the agent\u2019s own attitudes\n(a certain desire of hers). But it seems that S might act on her\ndesire to get her glasses even if her only intention when she enters\nthe room is to retrieve her glasses. Second, intention-acquisitions\nthemselves can be explained by citing reasons. Since Ginet\u2019s\naccount of the reason-explanation of an action appeals to an\nintention, the question arises what can be said about the\nreason-explanation of the acquisition of that intention. Repeating the\nsame sort of account here would generate a regress.\n\nMcCann (1998: ch. 8 and 2012) takes a different approach. On his view,\nan agent decides for a certain reason, and citing that reason explains\nthe decision, just in case, in cognizance of that reason, and in an\nintrinsically intentional act of intention formation, the agent forms\nan intention the content of which reflects the very goals presented in\nthat reason. When S decides to enter T\u2019s room, for example, she\ndecides for the reason of getting her glasses only if the intention\nthat she forms in making that decision is an intention to enter for\nthe sake of getting her glasses. (Ginet [2008] offers a similar\naccount of reasons-explanations of decisions.)\n\nOne question about this account is whether what it proposes suffices\nfor acting for a reason. Here again there will be a clash of\nintuitions between causalists and noncausalists, with the former\nmaintaining that if S\u2019s desire to get her glasses plays no role\nat all in bringing about her decision, then even if the content of her\ndecision is to enter for the sake of getting her glasses, she does not\nreally decide for that reason and citing it does not truly explain her\ndecision.\n\nAnother question about the account concerns whether the required\ncorrespondence between the reasons for which one decides and the\ncontent of one\u2019s decision is really necessary. Sometimes prior\nto making a decision, an agent considers a large number and variety of\nfactors. Her decision might then be made for many different reasons.\nIt is implausible that each and every one of the reasons for which she\nmakes her decision must enter into the content of the intention that\nshe forms in making that decision. (For the same objection to a\nsimilar account of reason-explanation, see Mele 2003:\n42\u201343.)\n",
