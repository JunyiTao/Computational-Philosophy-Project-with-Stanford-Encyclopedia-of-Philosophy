    "main_text": "Shape Dynamics\n3. Shape Dynamics\n\nWe turn now to a modern-day attempt to implement Mach-heavy known as\n\u2018shape dynamics\u2019. (In fact, shape dynamics is just one\ntheory within this tradition, as we will see below.) This approach was\ninitiated \u2013 albeit not under that name \u2013 by Barbour and\nBertotti (1977, 1982). In tackling the problem of implementing\nMach-heavy, rather than formulating a revised law of gravity/inertia\nusing relative quantities, Barbour and Bertotti used the framework of\nLagrangian mechanics, replacing elements of the mathematics referring\nto absolute quantities of motion with new terms invoking only relative\ndistances, velocities, etc. In this section, we presuppose a basic\nfamiliarity with the Lagrangian framework. For a non-technical\nintroduction to shape dynamics, see Barbour (1999); for an up-to-date\nreview of recent work in the field, see Mercati (2018).\n\nIn this section, we survey the results and motivations of the shape\ndynamics research program, focussing first on the above-mentioned\ntheory of Barbour and Bertotti (which recovers a subsection of the\nsolution space of Newtonian particle theory), before turning to the\nMachian alternative to general relativity developed by Barbour and\ncollaborators: it is this latter theory which is shape dynamics\n\u2018proper\u2019. Readers uninterested in the technical details of\nthis work can skip to section 3.5, in which its conceptual upshots are\ndiscussed.\n3.1. Configuration Space\n\nFor a given physical system, define its \u2018configuration\nspace\u2019 to be the space of possible instantaneous states of that\nsystem. (For example, the space of possible distributions of N\nparticles in Euclidean space, according to a Cartesian coordinate\nsystem laid down on that space.) As the system evolves, the point in\nconfiguration space representing the system\u2019s instantaneous\nstate traces out a continuous curve. On this picture, metaphysically\npossible worlds are represented by (rising) curves in the product\nspace formed from configuration space and a one-dimensional space\nrepresenting time. Nomologically possible worlds are represented by\nthose curves that are allowed by the dynamics. For example, in the\nLagrangian formalism, the nomologically possible worlds are\nrepresented by those curves which extremize the action: a particular\nfunctional of such curves.\n\nConsider now, for the sake of concreteness, two Newtonian worlds which\ndiffer by either a static or a kinematic Leibniz shift: that is,\nconstant translations or velocity boosts of the material content of\nthe universe (see the companion entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n for further discussion of such shifts). These two worlds will be\nrepresented by distinct curves in configuration space. However, given\na configuration space, one can construct a \u2018reduced\u2019\nconfiguration space, in which certain such histories are\nmathematically identified, or \u2018quotiented\u2019, such that they\nare mapped to the same unique history in reduced configuration space.\nSpecifically, proponents of this approach define two such reduced\nconfiguration spaces:\n\n\u2018Relative configuration space\u2019, which is configuration\nspace quotiented by rigid translations and rotations. (I.e., curves in\nconfiguration space which represent worlds which differ by rigid\ntranslations or rotations are mathematically identified.)\n\u2018Shape space\u2019, which its configuration space\nquotiented by rigid translations, rotations, and dilatations. (I.e.,\ncurves in configuration space which represent worlds which differ by\nrigid translations, rotations, or dilatations are mathematically\nidentified.)\n\n\n(Two points here. First, recall that a \u2018dilatation\u2019 is a\nscale transformation. Second, in what follows we will refer to the\ngroup which consists of the union of translations, rotations and\ndilatations as the \u2018similarity group\u2019.) If these Machian\ntheorists are able to formulate a dynamics on shape space (i.e., a\ndynamics which identifies the curves in shape space which represent\nnomologically possible worlds), then that dynamics will, in light of\nthe above reduction, not bring with it a meaningful notion of absolute\nposition, or absolute velocity, or absolute scales. Barbour and\ncollaborators take such a dynamics to realize Mach-heavy: the\nundetectable spacetime structure associated with such quantities has\nbeen expunged. Below, we will see how this can be done in the concrete\ncontexts of Newtonian particle dynamics and general relativity.\n3.2. Emergent Temporality\n\nThe Machian ambitions of Barbour and collaborators do not end there,\nfor these authors also seek to excise primitive temporal structure.\nInitially, one might distinguish histories that correspond to a single\ncurve in configuration space being traced out at different rates with\nrespect to the primitive temporal parameter. Those working in this\ntradition, however, view each curve in configuration space as\ncorresponding to exactly one possible history. They therefore elect to\ndispose of the auxiliary one-dimensional space representing a\nprimitive absolute time which was introduced above. Instead, they seek\nto construct an \u2018emergent\u2019 notion of temporality from\ndynamics defined on configuration space alone. By way of a procedure\nknown as \u2018Jacobi\u2019s principle\u2019, the Machian\nrelationist selects a unique temporal parameter which maximally\nsimplifies this dynamics defined on configuration space. For the\ndetails of Jacobi\u2019s principle, see Pooley (2013).\n3.3. Best Matching\n\nIt is all well and good speaking of a dynamics defined on relative\nconfiguration space, or shape space. However, it remains incumbent on\nour Machian theorists to construct explicit dynamics appropriate for\nthese spaces: i.e., dynamics which do not recognise solutions related\nby the action of the similarity group (viz., translations, rotations,\nand dilatations) as being distinct. Given a dynamics on configuration\nspace, one can indeed achieve this task. The procedure which\nimplements this is known as \u2018best matching\u2019, and was\ndeveloped in the seminal work of Barbour and Bertotti (1982), in which\na version of Newtonian particle mechanics with dynamics formulated on\nrelative configuration space was first constructed. The extension to\nshape space was undertaken in (Barbour 2003).\n\nInformally, the goal of best matching is to use the similarity group\nto minimize the intrinsic difference between successive points along a\nhistory in configuration space. To take a simple example drawn from\nBarbour (1999), consider the history of a particular triangle: the\ntriangle may, along that history, rotate, dilate, alter its internal\nangles, and so on. However, at each point best matching allows one to\nact on the triangle with similarity transformations; thereby,\ntriangles which at successive points along a history differ merely by\na translation, rotation or dilatation will be regarded as being\nidentical after best matching. In this way, a \u2018best\nmatched\u2019 history is selected, in which the intrinsic differences\nbetween successive states of the system under consideration (in the\nabove example, the triangle) are minimised. While a metric on\nconfiguration space will in general assign a different length to\nhistories differing by the action of the similarity group, the length\nof the best matched history, constructed via the above procedure, will\ninduce a unique length of paths, and therefore metric, on shape\nspace.\n\nA little more formally, the best matching procedure works as follows.\nConsider a class of paths in configuration space, all corresponding to\nthe same path in shape space (i.e., consider a class of paths in\nconfiguration space related by the action of the similarity group). As\nmentioned above, a given metric on configuration space will in general\nassign to each path in that space a different length; as a result, the\nlength of the associated path in shape space will be underdetermined.\nHowever, starting from any given point p in configuration space, one\ncan use the action of the similarity group on configuration space to\ndefine a unique curve, by shifting the points of any curve through p\nalong the corresponding orbits of the similarity group (think of these\n\u2018orbits\u2019 as contour lines in configuration space, relating\npoints which differ only by the action of the similarity group) so as\nto extremize the length assigned to the curve (relative to the metric\nunder consideration). It is this extremized length which is assigned\nto the unique curve in shape space. With each curve in shape space\nassigned a unique length, one can then, as usual, specify a principle\nwhich selects some such curves as representing nomologically possible\nworlds, based upon their lengths. (Recall again, for example, that in\nLagrangian mechanics it is those curves which extremize an action\nwhich are regarded as being dynamically possible.)\n3.4. Relativistic Best Matching\n\nThe best matching prescription can be applied not only to Newtonian\nparticle theories, but also to other spacetime theories, including\nGTR. (There is no reason why best matching cannot be applied to\nNewtonian field theories, or to special relativistic particle\ndynamics, but these steps are usually skipped by Machian relationists\nfollowing in the tradition of Barbour and Bertotti, who proceed at\nthis stage straight to GTR.)\n\nTo see how best matching works in the case of GTR, first note that a\ncertain subclass of solutions of that theory (namely, those which are\nglobally hyperbolic) can be formulated in terms of the \u20183+1\nformalism\u2019, according to which the state of the universe at a\nparticular time is represented by a determinate 3-manifold with\nassociated Riemannian metric; dynamical equations then determine how\nsuch 3-geometries evolve in time. (For a summary of the 3+1 formalism,\nsee e.g. Gourgoulhon (2012).) The Machian relationists working in the\nshape dynamics research program take this 3+1 approach to GTR as their\nstarting point. They thus assume that instantaneous spaces which are\nthe points in configuration space have the determinate topology of\nsome closed 3-manifold without boundary. Configuration space is the\nspace of Riemannian 3-metrics on that 3-manifold. The natural analogue\nof relative configuration space is, then, this space of Riemannian\n3-metrics quotiented by diffeomorphisms, which are the generalisations\nof Leibniz shifts appropriate to GTR (see the entry on\n the hole argument).\n The analogue of shape space in this case is the space of Riemannian\n3-metrics, but quotiented in addition by local dilatations (by\n\u2018local\u2019, we mean here a transformation which can vary from\npoint to point).\n\nHaving constructed shape space in the relativistic case, one may then\nbest match in order to construct one\u2019s relational theory\nimplementing Mach-heavy (the metric on configuration space is defined\nfrom the 3+1 dynamics of GTR): conceptually, the approach here is the\nsame as that presented in the previous section. Moreover, one can\nagain apply Jacobi\u2019s principle, in order to eliminate a\ncommitment to primitive temporal structure. In this case, the\nresulting theory is known as \u2018shape dynamics\u2019, which\ninvolves a commitment only to primitive conformal structure (i.e.,\nfacts about angles between objects) on the 3-geometries: all other\nabsolute quantities, the claim goes, have been excised. One way to\nunderstand the relationship between GTR and shape dynamics is that one\ntrades the relativity of simultaneity but absoluteness of scales in\nthe former theory, for absolute simultaneity but the relativity of\nscales in the latter.\n3.5. Conceptual Matters\n\nThere are important differences between the relationship between\n\u2018standard\u2019 Newtonian particle mechanics and its\nbest-matched alternative on the one hand, and the relationship between\nGTR and shape dynamics on the other. In the former case, the class of\nsolutions of the best-matched theory is a proper subset of the\nsolutions of Newtonian mechanics: for example, it includes only the\nsector of the solution space of Newtonian mechanics which ascribes\nzero angular momentum to the entire universe. Sometimes, this is\nmarketed as an advantage of the latter theory: the best-matched theory\npredicts what was, in the Newtonian case, an unexplained coincidence.\n(For discussion, see Pooley & Brown 2002.) In the latter case, by\ncontrast, it has been discovered that one can \u2018glue\u2019\nsolutions of shape dynamics to construct new solutions, which are not\nassociated with any particular solution of GTR (in the sense that they\nare not the best matched equivalents of any solution of GTR): see\n(Mercati 2018). Thus, the solution spaces of GTR and shape dynamics\noverlap, but the latter is not a proper subset of the former. Given\nthis, it is no longer clear that shape dynamics can be presented as a\n\u2018more predictive\u2019 alternative to GTR.\n\nA second conceptual point to make regarding the Machian relationism of\nBarbour and collaborators pertains to its motivations. Barbour claims,\nas we have already seen above, that only spatial angles \u2013 and\nnot spatial scales, or a temporal timescale, or absolute velocities or\npositions \u2013 are directly empirically observable. Thus, the\nthought goes that an empiricist of good standing should favour (say)\nshape dynamics over GTR, for the former theory, unlike the latter,\nrenders only such \u2018directly observable\u2019 quantities\nmeaningful; it does not commit to any absolute quantities which are\nnot \u2018directly observable\u2019. There are, however, two central\npoints at which this reasoning could be questioned. First: one could\nrepudiate Barbour\u2019s empiricist motivations. Second: one could\ndeny that only angles are directly observable, or, indeed, that this\nstructure is directly observable at all (see Pooley 2013, p. 47). As\nPooley points out, these are not the strongest grounds on which to\nmotivate Barbour\u2019s project. Rather, a better motivation is this:\nbest-matched theories have the merit of ontological parsimony, as\ncompared with the theories such as Newtonian particle mechanics or\ngeneral relativity, to which the best-matching procedure is applied. A\nsecond motivation has to do with the potential of this research\nprogramme to present new avenues for exploration in the quest for a\nquantum theory of gravity.\n\nOur third and final point is this. Although it is possible to couple\nshape dynamics to matter (see e.g. (Gomes 2012)), in this theory, just\nas in GTR as discussed in the previous section, one also has vacuum\nsolutions, with primitive conformal structure on the 3-geometries.\nGiven the existence of these vacuum solutions, as with GTR, it is far\nfrom clear that the theory makes good on the ambitions of Mach and the\nearly Einstein to construct a theory in which all spatiotemporal\nnotions are reduced to facts about matter. That said, it is worth\nnoting that, unlike in GTR, in shape dynamics one cannot have\na solution consisting of a single rotating body: the overall angular\nmomentum of the universe must vanish.\n4. The Dynamical Approach\n\nSince 2000, a new \u2018dynamical\u2019 approach to spacetime\nstructure has emerged in the works of Robert DiSalle (2006) and\nespecially Oliver Pooley and Harvey Brown (2001, 2006). This approach\nis to be situated against an opposing, supposedly orthodox\n\u2018geometrical\u2019 approach to spacetime structure, as\nencapsulated in the works of e.g. Janssen (2009) and Maudlin (2012).\n(This is not to say that either the dynamical view or the opposing\ngeometrical view is a unified edifice, as we will see below.) The\ndynamical-geometrical debate has many facets, but one can take the\ncentral bone of contention to pertain to the arrow of explanation: is\nit the case that the geometrical structures of spacetime explain why\nmaterial bodies behave as they do (as the geometrical view would have\nit), or is it rather the case that the geometrical structure of\nspacetime is explained by facts about the behaviour of material bodies\n(as the dynamical view would have it)? Although this debate connects\nwith historical debates between substantivalists and relationists, it\nshould be regarded as a distinct dispute, for reasons to which we will\ncome.\n\nWhile it is important to keep in mind the above disagreement regarding\nthe arrow of explanation when one is considering the\ndynamical-geometrical debate, it will be helpful in this article to\nhone in on two more specific claims of the dynamical approach, as\npresented by Brown (2005), consistent with the above claim that it is\nfacts about the dynamics of material bodies which explain facts about\nspatiotemporal structure, rather than vice versa. These two claims are\nthe following (Read 2020a):\n\nFixed background space-time structures, such as the Minkowski\nspace-time of STR, or Newton\u2019s absolute space, are to be\nontologically reduced to the symmetries of the dynamical equations\ngoverning matter fields.\nNo piece of space-time structure, whether fixed or dynamical (in\nthe latter case, as in GTR) is necessarily surveyed by physical\nbodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether this is so, one must\nattend carefully to the details of the dynamics governing the\nparticular matter fields which constitute physical bodies.\n\n\nOn the first of these two points: proponents of the dynamical approach\nmaintain that the spacetime structure of our world is what it is\nbecause of the dynamical laws of nature and their symmetries.\nThat is, the dynamical laws are (at least, relative to spacetime)\nfundamental, and spacetime structure is derivative; in this sense, the\nview is (at least in some cases) a modern-day form of relationism\n(Pooley 2013, \u00a76.3.2) \u2013 albeit of a very different kind\nfrom the relationist approaches considered up to this point. (Note,\nthough, that this relationism is a corollary of the above\nexplanatory contention of the dynamical approach; moreover, it is one\nwhich is applicable only to theories which fixed spacetime structure\nsuch as Newtonian mechanics or STR \u2013 and therefore not\nto theories with dynamical spacetime structure, such as GTR. For this\nreason, as already indicated above, proponents of the dynamical view\nare not to be identified na\u00efvely with relationists.)\n\nOn the second of these two points: the idea \u2013 what Butterfield\n(2007) calls \u2018Brown\u2019s moral\u2019 \u2013 is that one\ncannot simply posit a piece of geometrical structure in one\u2019s\ntheory, e.g. a Minkowski metric field in STR, and know ab\ninitio that material bodies (in particular rods and clocks) will\nread off intervals of that structure; rather, whether this is the case\nor not will depend upon the constitution of, and dynamics governing,\nthose material bodies. We will see below specific theories in which\nany such assumption seems to fail. Note that this second point is\nagain consistent with the explanatory contention taken above to be\ncharacteristic of the dynamical approach: a given piece of structure\ninherits its operational significance as spacetime by dint of the\nbehaviour of material bodies.\n\nBefore addressing the second of these two points, we should consider\nthe first in greater detail. The claim that fixed spatiotemporal\nstructure is to be ontologically reduced to facts about material\nbodies invites many questions, chief among which is perhaps the\nfollowing: to what could this ontological reduction possibly amount?\nIn the following section, we will see one particular metaphysical\nprogramme which promises to make good on this claim.\n4.1 The Dynamical Approach and Regularity Relationism\n\nThere is arguably a tight relationship between the geometrical\nsymmetries of a spacetime and the symmetries of a theory that\ndescribes the physics of matter (in a broad sense, including fields)\nin it. (Theories such as GTR, in which space-time has its own dynamics\nare more complicated, and will be discussed later; for further\ndiscussion of symmetries in physics, see the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking.)\n Each symmetry is a set of transformations, with a rule of\ncomposition: formally a \u2018group\u2019. For instance, the group\nof rotations in the plane has a distinct element for every angle in\nthe range 0\u2013360 degrees; the composition of two rotations is the\nsingle rotation through the sum of their angles. Spacetime symmetries\nare those transformations which leave invariant a piece of spacetime\nstructure (e.g., the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime are\ntranslations, spatial rotations and Lorentz boosts: together, the\nso-called Poincar\u00e9 transformations); dynamical symmetries are\nthose transformations which leave invariant a set of dynamical\nequations (e.g., the symmetries of Maxwell\u2019s equations of\nelectromagnetism are again the Poincar\u00e9 transformations). There\nare good reasons to hold that the symmetry groups of theory and\nspacetime must agree. First, since the theory describes matter, and\nhence (arguably) what is measurable, any theoretical symmetries not\nreflected in the postulated spacetime structure indicate unmeasurable\ngeometry: for instance, if an absolute present were postulated in\nrelativistic physics. While in the other direction, if there were\nextra spacetime symmetries beyond those found in the dynamics, then\nper impossible one could measure nonexistent geometric\nquantities: for instance, a theory that depends on absolute velocities\ncannot be formulated in Galilean spacetime (see the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories\n for further discussion of these Newtonian spacetime structures).\nFamously, Earman (1989, ch. 3) declares that the matching of\nspace-time and dynamical symmetries is, thus, an \u2018adequacy\ncondition\u2019 on a physical theory.\n\nGiven this \u2018adequacy condition\u2019, a given geometry for\nspacetime formally constrains the allowable theories to those with the\njust the right symmetries: not too many, and not too few. It was an\nassumption of many substantivalists (the views of whom are discussed\nbelow) that this constraint was not merely formal, but ontological:\nthat the geometry is more fundamental than the laws, or that geometry\noffers a \u2018real\u2019 explanation of the form of the laws\n\u2013 such authors would, by the above categorization, qualify as\nproponents of a geometrical view. However, that the symmetries should\nagree does not specify any direction of dependence, and it could be\nreversed, so that the geometric symmetries are ontologically\ndetermined by those of the laws of the theory: hence the geometry\nitself is an expression of the (symmetry properties of the) dynamics\nof matter \u2013 transparently, this is consistent with the first of\nthe two specific commitments of the dynamical view discussed above. In\nthe words of Brown and Pooley (2006) (making these points about STR):\n\u201c\u2026 space-time\u2019s Minkowskian structure cannot be\ntaken to explain the Lorentz covariance of the dynamical laws. From\nour perspective \u2026 the direction of explanation goes the other\nway around. It is the Lorentz covariance of the laws that underwrites\nthe fact that the geometry of space-time is Minkowskian.\u201d\n\nOf the opposing geometrical approach to spacetime, Brown and Pooley\n(2006, p. 84) question the mechanism by which autonomous\nspacetime structure is supposed to explain or constrain the behaviour\nof material bodies. Although we will keep our attention focussed on\nthe dynamical view in this subsection, rather than upon its opponents\n(see the following subsection for more on the explanatory capacities\nof spacetime), one might, however, ask at this point: does the\ndynamical view really do better in this regard? How is it that\ndynamical symmetries are supposed to explain, or account for,\nspacetime structure? In the context of theories with fixed spacetime\nstructure, this question is answered by proponents of the dynamical\nview via an ontological reduction of spatiotemporal structure\nto symmetries of dynamical equations governing matter fields, as\nindicated in (1) above. (In fact, this \u2018reduction\u2019 is\nbetter described as a form of elimination, as we will see.)\nBut this, in turn, invites yet more questions: how, metaphysically, is\nthis ontological reduction operating? Can one in fact state dynamical\nlaws, or understand them as \u201cholding\u201d or\n\u201cgoverning\u201d, without presupposing facts about\nspacetime structure?\n\nTake, for example, Newton\u2019s laws of motion. The 1st law asserts\nthat bodies not acted upon by an external force will move with\nconstant velocity; similarly for the 2nd law and acceleration. These\nlaws seem to presuppose that these are meaningful terms, but in\nspacetime terms their meaning is given by geometric structures: for\ninstance, constant velocity in Galilean spacetime means having a\nstraight spacetime trajectory. And the problem is not restricted to\nNewtonian physics; the same point can be made regarding theories that\npresuppose the Minkowski background spacetime structure, e.g., the\nquantum field theories of the Standard Model.\n\nIt is increasingly well-appreciated that one suitable metaphysical\nprogram to which the dynamical approach can appeal here is\nHuggett\u2019s (2006) regularity relationism: see (Huggett 2009;\nPooley 2013; Stevens 2020). The idea is to consider the dynamical laws\nas regularities that systematize and describe the patterns of events\nconcerning an underlying ontology/ideology that involves or\npresupposes only very limited spatiotemporal features. To illustrate\nhow this approach might go, consider Pooley\u2019s (2013, \u00a76.3)\nproposal that the dynamical approach to STR might postulate only\nR4 topological spatiotemporal structure, which could be\n(for example) attributed to a massive scalar field. Suppose we are\ngiven a full 4D field description of such a field, in terms of some\narbitrary coordinate system. This would describe a simple\n\u2018Humean mosaic\u2019, to use David Lewis\u2019 term for\none\u2019s basic spatiotemporal and material commitments (see article\n David Lewis\n for further discussion). Now, smooth coordinate changes applied to\nsuch a description will generate distinct mathematical representations\nof that Humean mosaic, given using distinct coordinatizations of the\nfield-stuff. It might happen that, among all such representations,\nthere is a subclass of coordinate systems which are such that (i) when\nthe scalar field is described using a member of the class, it turns\nout that its values at spacetime points satisfy some simple/elegant\nmathematical equation; and moreover, (ii) the members of the class are\nrelated by a nicely-specifiable symmetry group. If this is so, then\nthe simple/elegant equation can be taken as expressing a dynamical law\nfor the world of this mosaic (understood as a statement: \u201cThere\nare frames in which \u2026\u201d), and the symmetry group of the\nlaw can be seen as capturing the derivative, not intrinsic,\nspacetime structure of the world. If the symmetry group is the\nPoincar\u00e9 group, for example, then the field behaves \u2018as\nif\u2019 it were embedded in a spacetime with Minkowski geometry. But\nall this means is that the dynamics is representationally equivalent\nto a theory with an autonomous Minkowski geometry. From the point of\nview of the dynamical approach, such a theory is merely an\ninteresting, and perhaps useful, representation of the real facts: and\nit\u2019s a mistake to take every feature of a representation to\ncorrespond to something in reality (Brown & Read 2020,\n\u00a75).\n\nEven granting that this regularity relationist understanding of the\ndynamical approach goes through, three outstanding issues for the\ndynamical approach deserve to be mentioned. First: given that the\nproponent of the view seeks to excise metrical (more generally:\ngeometrical) spacetime structure, one might ask: why stop there? Is\nthere not something unnatural about excising fixed metric structure,\nwhile taking topological structure to be primitive? Such a concern was\nraised by Norton (2008), to which two responses have been offered in\nthe literature: (I) In direct response to Norton, Pooley points out\nthat \u201cthe project was to reduce chronogeometric facts to\nsymmetries, not to recover the entire spatiotemporal nature of the\nworld from no spatiotemporal assumptions whatsoever\u201d (2013, p.\n57). (II) Menon (2019) has argued that the machinery of\n\u2018algebraic fields\u2019 can be deployed in order to reduce\ntopological structure to facts about matter, thereby, if successful,\nmeeting Norton\u2019s challenge head-on. Second: how is one to extend\nthe dynamical approach, understood as a form of Huggett\u2019s\nregularity relationism, to theories of dynamical space-time such as\nGTR? Here, the lack of spacetime symmetries in the theory has posed\nproblems for the successful implementation of any such account\n(Stevens 2014), although arguably initial progress in this regard has\nbeen made by Vassallo and Esfeld (2016). Third: to which symmetries of\nthe laws is the dynamical approach supposed to be sensitive? In the\nphilosophy of physics, it is common to draw a distinction between\n\u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019 symmetries: examples\nof the former include U(1) gauge transformations in electromagnetism;\nexamples of the latter are coordinate transformations, such as\nGalilean boosts in Newtonian mechanics. But there are many questions\nhere, such as: (i) how, precisely, is the distinction between internal\nand external symmetries to be drawn? (ii) why should the proponent of\nthe dynamical approach stop at external symmetries? For discussion of\nthese questions, see (Dewar 2020).\n4.2 Space-time and Explanation on the Dynamical Approach\n\nWe have already seen how the dynamical approach, qua\nprogramme of ontological reduction, is supposed to play out in the\ncontext of theories with fixed spacetime structure, including both\nNewtonian theories and STR. We have also witnessed Brown and\nPooley\u2019s concerns about the ability of a substantival spacetime\nto explain facts about the behavior of matter. These concerns are\nmotivated by apparent problem cases, in which the symmetries of a\nsubstantival spacetime seem to come apart from those of the dynamical\nlaws governing matter. Such cases include: (i) Newtonian mechanics set\nin Newtonian spacetime (Read 2020a); (ii) the Jacobson-Mattingly\ntheory (Jacobson & Mattingly 2001), in which dynamical symmetries\nare a subset of spacetime symmetries, as a result of the presence of\nan additional (dynamical) symmetry-breaking vector field (Read, Brown\n& Lehmkuhl 2018).\n\nIt is not obvious that these critiques are fair to proponents of a\ngeometrical view. One might take their position not to be that a\ncertain piece of geometrical structure (e.g., the Minkowski metric of\nSTR) invariably constrains matter, whenever it is present in a theory,\nto manifest its symmetries (a claim which seems to be false, in light\nof the above cases). Instead, one might take their claim to be\nconditional: if one has matter which couples to this piece of\ngeometrical structure in such-and-such a way, then that\ngeometrical structure can explain why the laws have the such-and-such\nsymmetries. In (Read, 2020a), the (arguably) straw man version of a\ngeometrical view critiqued by Brown and Pooley is dubbed the\n\u2018unqualified geometrical approach\u2019, in contrast with this\nmore nuanced and defensible version of the view, which is dubbed the\n\u2018qualified geometrical approach\u2019. (Brown might still\nreject the qualified geometrical approach on the grounds that it makes\nexplanatory appeal to objects which violate the \u2018action-reaction\nprinciple\u2019, which states that every entity physical should both\nact on, and react to, other physical entities (Brown 2005, p. 140). If\nso, that this is the real reason for the rejection deserves to be\nflagged; moreover, it remains open whether the objection succeeds\nagainst the non-substantivalist versions of the geometrical view which\nare discussed below.)\n\nFocussing on the qualified geometrical approach, there are also\nquestions regarding the particular sense in which spacetime structure\ncan be said to be explanatory of dynamical symmetries. One notion of\nexplanation discussed in this literature is that of a\n\u2018constructive explanation\u2019.This is derivative on\nEinstein\u2019s distinction between \u2018principle theories\u2019\nand \u2018constructive theories\u2019 (Einstein 1919): for detailed\ndiscussion, see (Brown 2005, \u00a75.2). In brief, a constructive\nexplanation is one in which phenomenological effects are explained by\nreference to real (but possibly unobservable) physical bodies. (For\nfurther discussion of how to understand constructive theories and\nexplanations, see (Frisch 2011).) With the idea of a constructive\nexplanation in mind, one can say this: if a proponent of a geometrical\nview hypostatizes spacetime, then they can give constructive\nexplanations of certain physical effects by appeal to that spacetime\nstructure; otherwise, they cannot. That said, even if one does not\nhypostatise spacetime, and so concedes that spacetime cannot offer\nconstructive explanations of the behaviour of matter, it is not\nobvious that spacetime cannot still facilitate other kinds of\nexplanation. For discussions of these issues, see (Acu\u00f1a 2016;\nDorato & Felline 2010; Frisch 2011; Read 2020b).\n4.3 The Dynamical Approach and General Relativity\n\nAs we have already seen in section 2, spacetime in GTR is dynamical.\nThis leads Brown to maintain that there is no substantial conceptual\ndistinction between the metric field of GTR and matter fields:\n\u201cGravity is different from the other interactions, but this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that it is categorically distinct from,\nsay, the electromagnetic field\u201d (Brown 2005, p. 159). In this\nsense, Brown is a relationist about GTR, and counts authors such as\n(Rovelli, 1997) as allies. However, much caution is needed concerning\nthis use of the term \u2018relationism\u2019. In particular, in the\ncontext of GTR \u2013 and in significant contrast with his approach\nto theories such as STR \u2013 Brown makes no claim that the metric\nfield should be ontologically reduced to properties of (the laws\ngoverning) matter fields; rather, in light of its dynamical status,\nthe metric field of GTR \u201ccries out for reification\u201d\n(Brown, personal communication). Indeed, even if Brown did not\nmaintain this, we have already registered above that there are\ntechnical problems with attempting to apply the dynamical approach,\nunderstood as a version of regularity relationism, to theories such as\nGTR.\n\nIn light of these issues, when considering GTR, Brown (2005, ch. 9)\nfocuses entirely on thesis (2), presented in the introduction to this\nsection: no piece of geometrical structure has its\n\u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of necessity \u2013 that\nis, no piece of geometrical structure is necessarily surveyed by\nphysical bodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether such is the\ncase, one must pay detailed attention to the dynamics of the matter\nfields constituting those physical bodies. This, indeed, should\nalready be evident in light of the examples discussed in the previous\nsubsection, such as the Jacobson-Mattingly theory, in which matter\ndoes not \u2018advert\u2019 to the designated piece of spacetime\nstructure.\n\nThis thesis (2) should be uncontroversial. There are, however,\nconcerns that the thesis is so uncontroversial that any\ndistinction between the dynamical approach and its opponents in the\ncontext of theories such as GTR (and, in particular, without the\nregularity relationist approach to ontological reduction applied in\nthe case of theories with fixed spacetime structure) has been effaced\n(Pooley 2013; Read 2020a). Even setting this aside, there are also\ndisagreements regarding how exactly a piece of structure in a given\ntheory is to acquire its \u2018chronogeometric\nsignificance\u2019 \u2013 that is, for the intervals which it\ndetermines to be accessible operationally to physical bodies and\nmeasuring devices. Brown\u2019s preferred answer to this question\n(Brown 2005, ch. 9) makes appeal to the \u2018strong equivalence\nprinciple\u2019. There are a great many subtleties and technical\ndifficulties which need to be overcome in order to attain a clear\nunderstanding of this principle (Read, Brown & Lehmkuhl 2018;\nWeatherall 2020), but, roughly speaking, it states that, in local\nregions in GTR, matter fields can be understood to obey Lorentz\ncovariant dynamical equations, just as in STR (we have already seen\nsomething of this in section 2 above). Absent further details,\npace Brown, it is not clear why this is sufficient to secure\nthe \u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of the metric field in\nGTR. Even setting this aside, there are questions regarding whether\nthe strong equivalence principle is necessary for\nchronogeometric significance. For example, an alternative approach\nmight make appeal to the results of (Ehlers, Pirani & Schild,\n1972), in which the authors demonstrate that the trajectories of\nmassive and massless bodies are sufficient to reconstruct the metric\nfield in GTR (cf. (Malament 2012, \u00a72.1)). These issues are raised\nin (Read 2020a), but much work remains to be done in uncovering the\nfull range of ways in which a given piece of structure might come to\nhave chronogeometric significance.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry, and its companion on\n classical theories,\n have been concerned with tracing the history and philosophy of\n\u2018absolute\u2019 and \u2018relative\u2019 theories of space\nand motion. Along the way we have been at pains to introduce some\nclear terminology for various different concepts (e.g.,\n\u2018true\u2019 motion, \u2018substantivalism\u2019,\n\u2018absolute space\u2019), but what we have not really done is say\nwhat the difference between absolute and relative space and\nmotion is: just what is at stake? Rynasiewicz (2000) argued that there\nsimply are no constant issues running through the history from\nantiquity through general relativity theory; that there is no stable\nmeaning for either \u2018absolute motion\u2019 or \u2018relative\nmotion\u2019 (or \u2018substantival space\u2019 vs\n\u2018relational space\u2019). While we agree to a certain extent,\nwe think that nevertheless there are a series of issues that have\nmotivated thinkers again and again. Rynasiewicz is probably right that\nthe issues cannot be expressed in formally precise terms, but that\ndoes not mean that there are no looser philosophical affinities that\nshed useful light on the history and on current theorizing.\n\nOur discussion has revealed several different issues, of which we will\nhighlight three as components of the \u2018absolute-relative\ndebate\u2019. (i) There is the question of whether all motions and\nall possible descriptions of motions are equal, or whether some are\n\u2018real\u2019 \u2013 what we have called, in Seventeenth Century\nparlance, \u2018true\u2019. There is a natural temptation for those\nwho hold that there is \u2018nothing but the relative positions and\nmotions between bodies\u2019 to add \u2018and all such motions are\nequal\u2019, thus denying the existence of true motion. However,\narguably \u2013 perhaps surprisingly \u2013 no one we have discussed\nhas unreservedly held this view (at least not consistently): Descartes\nconsidered motion \u2018properly speaking\u2019 to be privileged,\nLeibniz introduced \u2018active force\u2019 to ground motion\n(arguably in his mechanics as well as metaphysically), and\nMach\u2019s view seems to be that the distribution of matter in the\nuniverse determines a preferred standard of inertial motion. In\ngeneral relativity there is a well-defined distinction between\ninertial and accelerated motion, given by the spacetime metric, but\nEinstein initially hoped that the metric itself would be determined in\nturn by relative locations and motions of the matter distribution in\nspacetime.\n\nThat is, relationists can allow \u2018true\u2019 motions if they\noffer an analysis of them in terms of the relations between bodies.\nGiven this logical point, we are led to the second question: (ii) is\ntrue motion definable in terms of relations or not? (And if one hopes\nto give an affirmative answer, what kinds of relations are acceptable\nto use in the reductive definition?) It seems reasonable to call this\nthe issue of whether motion is absolute or relative.\nDescartes and Mach were relationists about motion in this sense, while\nNewton was an absolutist. In the case of Einstein and GTR we linked\nrelational motion to the satisfaction of Mach\u2019s Principle, just\nas Einstein did in the early years of the theory. Despite some\npromising features displayed by GTR, and certain of its models, we saw\nthat Mach\u2019s Principle is certainly not fully satisfied in GTR as\na whole. We also noted that in the absence of absolute simultaneity,\nit becomes an open question what relations are to be permitted in the\ndefinition (or supervience base) \u2013 spacetime interval relations?\nInstantaneous spatial distances and velocities on a 3-d hypersurface?\nThe shape dynamics program comes at this question from a new\nperspective, starting with momentary slices of space (with or without\nmatter contents) which are given a strongly relational \u2013 as\nopposed to absolute \u2013 interpretation. However, we argued that it\nultimately remains unclear whether this approach vindicates\nMach\u2019s Principle.\n\nThe final issue we have discussed in this article is that of (iii)\nwhether spacetime structures are substantial entities in their own\nright, metaphysically speaking not grounded on facts about dynamical\nlaws, or whether instead it is best to think of the reality of\nspacetime structures as dependent upon, and explained by, facts about\nthe world\u2019s dynamical laws, as advocates of the dynamical\napproach maintain. The debate here is not the same as that between\nclassical relationism and substantivalism, although there are clear\naffinities between the dynamical approach and classical relationism.\nWe explored how this issue takes quite different forms in the context\nof special relativistic (Lorentz covariant) physical theories and in\nthe context of general relativistic theories.",
