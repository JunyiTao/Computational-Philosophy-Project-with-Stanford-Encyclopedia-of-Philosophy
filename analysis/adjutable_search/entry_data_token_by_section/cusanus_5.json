    "main_text": "A Neoplatonism of His Own\n3. A Neoplatonism of His Own\n\nHow does Nicholas\u2019 Neoplatonism aid his thinking about God? One\nadvantage is that Nicholas can take the basic asymmetry between\nparadigmatic Platonic Forms and the perceptible realm of particular\nthings that are images of the Forms and apply that asymmetry to the\nway the First Principle, God, is related to all other created\nrealities. In working out this relationship, Plato proposed that what\nresults for individual Forms is that all particulars\n\u201cparticipate\u201d in the relevant Form just the way an image\nreflects and depends on its original. That is to say, the Form does\nnot require the particulars but is prior ontologically. The relation\nbetween Form and particulars is not one of reciprocal dependence.\nApplied to the first ontological principle, or to the Christian God,\nthe result is to let all the multiple, complex creatures participate\nin their ultimate Source while the divine Creator remains simple,\nunparticipated and unchanged. As Christian medieval thinkers (even the\nAristotelians agreed on this point) were accustomed to express it,\ncreatures depend on God while God is not at all dependent on\ncreatures. All the dependence is one-way.\n\nAnd that dependence is interpreted in Platonic and Biblical terms, as\nthe dependence of creaturely images on a divine Original. While the\ntotal reality of an image requires the influence of the original,\nthere is nothing about the latter that is ontologically in need of the\nimage. In Platonism this effectively means there is\n\u201cseparation\u201d of the intelligible and perceptible realms,\nfor in fact the perceptible cannot exist without the very intelligible\nthat abides unaffected by the realm of multiplicity and change. While\nnot being themselves Forms, perceptible things are not really separate\nfrom the intelligible Forms on which they depend. No less than Form\nand perceptible thing in Platonism and Neoplatonism, in Christian\nNeoplatonism Creator and creature are bound together in a parallel\nasymmetry.\n\nIf this asymmetry is rethought in terms of the presence required for\nthe creatures to be all that they are by nature, it will turn out that\nGod (or the One in non-Christian Neoplatonisms), the greater and prior\nreality, must always be there if creaturely reality is to be\nforthcoming and to continue. Now creatures as created images can stand\nfor manifestation and reflection of (and for Christian thinkers,\nlikeness to) as well as for dependence on God, for the divine presence\npenetrates and encompasses each and all creatures without ever being\nlimited or captured by any of them. While Plato\u2019s Forms play a\ndefinitive role in the perceptible realm as responsible for the\ndeterminate characteristics of things, they count as a kind of present\nabsence. No less determinative is the ongoing presence of the\nChristian God and that, too, has become a kind of absence. How should\nwe attempt to understand this?\n\nOur conceptions of the absence or presence of one thing to another are\ntaken originally from and remain most at home in the realm of limited\nphysical beings. Here presence to or absence from another involves the\nsame sort of mutuality or reciprocity that the same corporeal realm of\nlimited things must always manifest. If body A is present to or absent\nfrom body B, B is present to or absent from A and vice versa. The\nother sorts of important presence or absence we are familiar\nwith\u2014presence in thought, in memory and imagination and\naffection, for instance\u2014are metaphorical to some degree and are\nextensions from and find their source in our experience of some prior\nphysical presence, whether merely perceived and understood, or hoped\nfor, or feared. So too with the kinds of metaphorical absence we\nrecognize when some present person is, as we say, \u201cjust not\nthere.\u201d And absence, whether indifferent, bad or good,\npresupposes presence. Such metaphorical presences and absences of\nlimited things to one another might thus be understood as absent\npresences or present absences.\n\nAnd so we are able to speculate about the case of a non-finite\npresence-in-absence by starting with but moving beyond the limits of\nthe presence and absence we are familiar with in the realm of limited\nthings. Now we turn to the presence of the unfamiliar infinite One as\nwhat is finally required, even if not obviously experienced, to keep\nthe creaturely image present and real. In this case, we may think that\nabsence becomes what is metaphorical and the presence of the First is\nin truth ineluctably and literally necessary to explain the reality of\nanything and everything. But God\u2019s presence is hardly like that\nof one physical thing to another.\n\nThis means that the presence of God and God\u2019s identity with\nthings is not to be thought as the kind of reciprocity, say, that two\ncreated physical things have that are present to one another, let\nalone similar or identical to each other. What is distinctive about\nChristian Neoplatonism is its ability to hold together dialectically\nin thought the insight it provides about this asymmetrical,\nnon-reciprocal ontological connection between God and creatures. God\npenetrates and surpasses or exceeds each thing God creates and\nencompasses. Creatures are thus themselves real with the limited sort\nof independence they manifest, yet they are at once in God and indeed\none with God without being themselves divine.\n\nBut what has all this to do with Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s having a\nNeoplatonism of his own? What is characteristic of his thought, I want\nto propose, is that in key passages of major works he proposes this\nsame kind of dialectical thinking to enable our grasping the general\nrelationship between God and creatures. But the thinking is supposed\nto reflect an ontological dialectic, that is to say, a relationship\nthat is real whether we acknowledge it or not. The dialectical\nrelation between God and creatures is something towards which we\nmostly gesture in our efforts to do it justice in thought and speech.\nBut is this not merely Proclus or Dionysius or Eriugena or Eckhart\nrevisited in the fifteenth century? The answer is both yes and no.\n\nYes, the dialectical reality envisioned by Nicholas should be little\ndifferent than that pointed to by earlier Christian Neoplatonists.\nNeither Plato\u2019s Forms nor the Christian God did or could change\nover the centuries nor did the need of particulars and creatures for\ntheir intelligible and divine originals. But also, no, for Cusanus\ngives the dialectical relation his own expression in a series of novel\nmetaphors for the connection between God and creatures. Some of his\noriginal metaphors, such as the coincidence of opposites,\nenfolding/unfolding, God as the Not Other, and as the Oppositeness of\nopposites, are controlled by and witness to that same asymmetrical\nrelationship, yet lead our speculative imaginations in some new\ndirections that would otherwise remain unexplored.\n\nIf only God can bespeak Godself in literal terms, then we humans are\ngraced with metaphors. What Cusanus provides in his metaphorical\nforays is not simply imaginative originality, but a series of\nmetaphors designed to remind us that there is no proportion between\ncreatures and creator; that indeed there is an asymmetry between them.\nMoreover, our best ways of conceiving and asserting this necessary\nlack of reciprocal dependence should be built into the metaphors we\nchoose. This is why one may not need a theory of metaphor to do\njustice to the Cusan project of philosophical theology. Rather, the\nCusan project is Neoplatonic and has its own traditional strictures on\nany metaphors he chooses: the ontology determines the metaphors, the\nmetaphors do not determine the ontology. What makes Nicholas\u2019\nthought a Neoplatonism of his own is precisely the grasp his metaphors\ndemonstrate of those ontological strictures, as well as the\nspeculative imagination he evinces in the range, originality and\nvariety of metaphors for what we can and cannot understand about\nGod\u2019s connection with creatures.\n",
