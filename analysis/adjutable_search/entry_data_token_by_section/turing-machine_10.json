    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues Related to Turing Machines || Human and Machine Computations\n3.1 Human and Machine Computations\n\nIn its original context, Turing\u2019s identification between the\ncomputable numbers and Turing machines was aimed at proving that the\nEntscheidungsproblem is not a computable problem and so not a\nso-called \u201cgeneral process\u201d problem (Turing 1936\u20137:\n248). The basic assumption to be made for this result is that our\n\u201cintuitive\u201d notion of computability can be formally\ndefined as Turing computability and so that there are no\n\u201ccomputable\u201d problems that are not Turing computable. But\nwhat was Turing\u2019s \u201cintuitive\u201d notion of\ncomputability and how can we be sure that it really covers all\ncomputable problems, and, more generally, all kinds of computations?\nThis is a very basic question in the\n philosophy of computer science.\n\nAt the time Turing was writing his paper, the modern computer was not\ndeveloped yet and so rephrasings of Turing\u2019s thesis which\nidentify Turing computability with computability by a modern computer\nare interpretations rather than historically correct statements of\nTuring\u2019s thesis. The existing computing machines at the time\nTuring wrote his paper, such as the differential analyzer or desk\ncalculators, were quite restricted in what they could compute and were\nused in a context of human computational practices (Grier 2007). It is\nthus not surprising that Turing did not attempt to formalize machine\ncomputation but rather human computation and so computable problems in\nTuring\u2019s paper become computable by human means. This is very\nexplicit in Section 9 of Turing 1936\u20137 where he shows that\nTuring machines are a \u2018natural\u2019 model of (human)\ncomputation by analyzing the process of human computation. The\nanalysis results in a kind of abstract human \u2018computor\u2019\nwho fulfills a set of different conditions that are rooted in\nTuring\u2019s recognition of a set of human limitations which\nrestrict what we can compute (of our sensory apparatus but also of our\nmental apparatus). This \u2018computor\u2019 computes (real) numbers\non an infinite one-dimensional tape divided into squares [Note: Turing\nassumed that the reduction of the 2-dimensional character of the paper\na human mathematician usually works on \u201cis not essential of\ncomputation\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137: 249)]. It has the following\nrestrictions (Gandy 1988; Sieg 1994):\n\nDeterminacy condition D \u201cThe behaviour of\nthe computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is\nobserving and his \u2018state of mind\u2019 at that moment.\u201d\n(Turing 1936\u20137: 250)\nBoundedness condition B1 \u201cthere is a bound\nB to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe\nat one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive\nobservations.\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137: 250)\nBoundedness condition B2 \u201cthe number of\nstates of mind which need be taken into account is finite\u201d\n(Turing 1936\u20137: 250)\nLocality condition L1 \u201cWe may [\u2026]\nassume that the squares whose symbols are changed are always\n\u2018observed\u2019 squares.\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137: 250)\nLocality condition L2 \u201ceach of the new\nobserved squares is within L squares of an immediately\npreviously observed square.\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137: 250)\n\n\nIt is this so-called \u201cdirect appeal to intuition\u201d\n(1936\u20137: 249) of Turing\u2019s analysis and resulting model\nthat explain why the Turing machine is today considered by many as the\nbest standard model of computability (for a strong statement of this\npoint of view, see Soare 1996). Indeed, from the above set of\nconditions one can quite easily derive Turing\u2019s machines. This\nis achieved basically by analyzing the restrictive conditions into\n\u201c\u2018simple operations\u2019 which are so elementary that it\nis not easy to imagine them further divided\u201d (Turing\n1936\u20137: 250).\n\nNote that while Turing\u2019s analysis focuses on human computation,\nthe application of his identification between (human) computation and\nTuring machine computation to the Entscheidungsproblem suggests that\nhe did not consider the possibility of a model of computation\nthat somehow goes \u201cbeyond\u201d human computation and is\ncapable of providing an effective and general procedure which solves\nthe Entscheidungsproblem. If that would have been the case, he would\nnot have considered the Entscheidungsproblem to be uncomputable.\n\nThe focus on human computation in Turing\u2019s analysis of\ncomputation, has led researchers to extend Turing\u2019s analysis to\ncomputation by physical devices. This results in (versions of) the\nphysical Church-Turing thesis. Robin Gandy focused on extending\nTuring\u2019s analysis to discrete mechanical devices (note that he\ndid not consider analog machines). More particularly, like Turing,\nGandy starts from a basic set of restrictions of computation by\ndiscrete mechanical devices and, on that basis, develops a new model\nwhich he proved to be reducible to the Turing machine model. This work\nis continued by Wilfried Sieg who proposed the framework of Computable\nDynamical Systems (Sieg 2008). Others have considered the possibility\nof \u201creasonable\u201d models from physics which\n\u201ccompute\u201d something that is not Turing computable. See for\ninstance Aaronson, Bavarian, & Gueltrini 2016 (Other Internet\nResources) in which it is shown that if closed timelike curves\nwould exist, the halting problem would become solvable with finite\nresources. Others have proposed alternative models for computation\nwhich are inspired by the Turing machine model but capture specific\naspects of current computing practices for which the Turing machine\nmodel is considered less suited. One example here are the persistent\nTuring machines intended to capture interactive processes. Note\nhowever that these results do not show that there are\n\u201ccomputable\u201d problems that are not Turing\ncomputable. These and other related proposals have been considered by\nsome authors as reasonable models of computation that somehow compute\nmore than Turing machines. It is the latter kind of statements that\nbecame affiliated with research on so-called hypercomputation\nresulting in the early 2000s in a rather fierce debate in the computer\nscience community, see, e.g., Teuscher 2004 for various positions.\n",
