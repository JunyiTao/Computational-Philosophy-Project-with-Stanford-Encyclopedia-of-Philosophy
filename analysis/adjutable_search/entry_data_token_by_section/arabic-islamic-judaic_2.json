    "main_text": "The Brethren of Purity (Ikhwan al-Safa) and Their Followers\n3. The Brethren of Purity (Ikhwan al-Safa) and Their Followers\n\nThe scientific-philosophical Arabo-Islamic encyclopedia bearing the\ntitle Epistles of the Brethren of Purity and of the Lovers of\nFaith (Rasa\u2019il ikhwan al-safa\u2019 wa-khullan\nal-wafa\u2019), which includes 52 treatises about\nmathematical sciences, logic, physical sciences, metaphysics,\nanthropology, and theology, had a relevant, although unexpected and\nnot usually studied influence on Medieval Judaic thought in the\n11th-15th centuries in Spain and Provence, and\nin Yemen as well.\n\nAccording to a tradition, the encyclopedia, possibly written in the\nNear East in the first half of the 9th century by a still\nunknown author (maybe Abu-l Qasim Maslama al-Majriti, d. 964: see\nCarusi 2000, 500\u2013502), was known in Spain around 1050; as a\nmatter of fact, there might be some traces of its influence on Solomon\nIbn Gabirol (Avicebron, 1021\u20131058 or 1070), one of the most\nwell-known Medieval Jewish philosophers, living and working in\nAndalusia in the first half of the 11th century. According\nto Jacques Schlanger (see Schlanger 1968, 94\u201397), Ibn Gabirol\nmight have taken from the Brethren of Purity the correspondence\nbetween the hierarchy of the beings and the series of the first ten\nnumbers, as well as the reference to the doctrine of some sages about\nthe necessity to \u201ccultivate\u201d our souls through the study\nof celestial things. According to Georges Vajda (see Vajda 1947,\n24\u201333), more relevant traces might be found in chapter two of\nthe Introduction to the Duties of the Hearth (Hidaya ila\nfara\u2019id al-qulub), written by the Spanish Jewish author\nBahya Ibn Paquda in the period 1050\u20131080, where there might be\nsome agreements with the Brethren\u2019s cosmological doctrines, as\nwell as a very similar style in defending them. As a matter of fact,\nboth these cases do not prove a direct use of the Brethren\u2019s\nwork by these two Jewish philosophers. The first sure traces of a\ndirect influence of the doctrines of the Brethren of Purity are found\nin two works written in two different Spanish areas in Judaeo-Arabic\n(the language of Jews living in Arabic countries) around 1130, and\npossibly influencing each other: the Book of Microcosm\n(Kitab al-\u2018alam al-sagir) by Joseph Ibn Zaddiq (d.\n1149), and the Treatise of the Garden by Moses Ibn Ezra. The\noriginal text of the work by Joseph Ibn Zaddiq, a rabbinical judge\nliving in Cordoba, is lost, but an anonymous Medieval Hebrew\ntranslation is still preserved in some manuscripts, and has been\npublished twice. It includes a number of evident but not literal\nreferences to the doctrines of the Brethren of Purity (see Vajda\n1949), and its relationship to them was implicitly admitted by the\nauthor himself at the very beginning of his work, as follows:\n\u201cIt seems to me that the way for arriving to this great and\nterrible knowledge (i.e. that of theological truths) consists in\nunderstanding the books written by the pure philosophers and the\ndivine sages\u201d (Horovitz 1903, 3). Moreover, in his letter to\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon Maimonides explicitely affirmed: \u201cI have not\nread Joseph Ibn Zaddiq\u2019s Microcosm, but I know the\nauthor, his value and the value of his book: surely he follows the\nideas of the Brethren of Purity\u201d (Marx 1934\u20131935, 379)\n\u2013 an affirmation which, according to Sarah Stroumsa, should be\ninterpreted as a substantial critique to Ibn Zaddiq\u2019s\nphilosophical views (Stroumsa 1990). As for Moses Ibn Ezra, his\nTreatise of the Garden is clearly full of references to\npassages and doctrines indirectly inspired by, and in some cases\nliterally taken from the Brethren of Purity. As recently shown by Paul\nFenton in his book about the contents of Ibn Ezra\u2019s work (Fenton\n1997; see also Fenton 1976, 297), the Treatise of the Garden\nincludes at least thirty-six passages of the Epistles of the\nBrethren of Purity, as well as a number of\ncases where their influence appears to be rather evident. For example,\nthe Brethren of Purity clearly influenced Ibn Ezra\u2019s doctrines\nabout the creation of the world from the First Intellect and the\nprocession of the beings from God to matter, about nature as a power\nof the Universal Soul, as well as about man as a microcosm. In the\nsame period, even Abraham Ibn Ezra, the well-known Spanish Jewish\nauthor and scientist active in Italy, France and England in the period\n1140\u20131160, knew and employed the Brethren of Purity (see Jospe\n1994, 46\u201348).\n\nPossibly as a consequence of the diffusion of the above works, the\ninfluence of the Brethren of Purity seems to have spread among a\nnumber of Jewish philosophers working in Spain during the\n13th century. In some cases, this influence passed through\nother minor Arab-Islamic authors, whose work was well-known among\nSpanish Jewish readers. The Spanish Islamic philosopher Ibn al-Sid\nal-Batalyawsi (from Badajoz, d. 1127) wrote a sort of compendium of\nthe Brethren\u2019s doctrines, the Book of the Gardens\n(Kitab al-hada\u2019iq), which was widespread among Jewish\nauthors (Kaufmann 1880, 32\u201363) either in its original Arabic\ntext, or in its three Medieval Hebrew translations (written between\n1200 and 1370: see Steinschneider 1893, 286\u2013288; Richler 1977),\noften under the title Book of Intellectual Circles (Sefer\nha-\u2018agullot ha-re\u2018yoniyyot); it was one of the direct\nsources of a Spanish philosopher and kabbalist, Isaac Ibn Latif, who\nspoke about the Brethren\u2019s doctrine of the five degrees of soul\n(vegetal, animal, human, sapiential, prophetical) in his Hebrew book\nThe Gate of Heavens (Sha\u2018ar ha-shamayim),\nwritten in the period 1230\u20131250 (see Heller-Wilensky 1967, 199).\nAnother anonymous work, The Balance of\nSpeculations (Me\u2019ozney ha-\u2018iyyunim),\nwritten in Hebrew (or in a Judaeo-Arabic lost original version) in\n13th-century Spain, is full of passages about numerology,\ncosmology, theology and natural sciences: some of them might have been\ninspired by al-Batalyawsi\u2019s compendium, but some others were\nevidently taken from the Epistle of the Brethren of Purity,\nin particular those concerning the essence of faith, mineralogy and\nbotany (Abrahamov 1995). Finally, it should be noted that the Brethren\nof Purity were employed as a direct philosophical source by Shem Tov\nIbn Falaquera in a number of occasions. In his Neoplatonic\nphilosophical anthology, The Book of\nDegrees (Sefer ha-ma\u2018alot), a Hebrew quotation\nascribed to a \u201csage\u201d (did Falaquera know that the work was\nmade by al-Majriti?) is in reality a literal passage of the\nEpistle of the Brethren of Purity dealing with the\nrelationship between the Universal Soul and the particular souls.\nFalaquera\u2019s The Book of the\nSeeker (Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh), a sort of short popular\nencyclopedia written in 1263, is full of quotations from most of the\nBrethren\u2019s treatises: these quotations deal with several themes,\nlike the difference between science and faith, some mathematical\nquestions, the principles of astronomy and music, the meaning of the\nterm \u201cnature\u201d, the doctrine of anima mundi, the\nclimates, as well as some doctrines about logic, meteorology, music\n(about this point, see Shiloah 1968), astrology and natural sciences,\nand even some moral tales. Also the Brethren\u2019s scientific\ndoctrines exerted a considerable influence over\n13th-century Jewish authors. In books three and four of his\nbulky scientific-philosophical encyclopedia, The\nOpinions of the Philosophers\n(De\u2018ot ha-filosofim), written around 1270 and still\nunpublished, Falaquera quotes a number of passages of the Brethren\nconcerning mineralogy and botany, where a sort of mixture of\nAristotelian doctrines and alchemy can be found. Falaquera\u2019s\nmineralogical doctrines should have directly influenced the treatment\nof mineralogy in other Hebrew texts, written around 1300, in\nparticular in Gershom ben Solomon of Arles\u2019 The Gate of\nHeavens and in an alchemical treatise falsely ascribed to an\nArabic author. Finally, the zoology and the mathematics of the\nBrethren of Purity were employed by Qalonymos ben Qalonymos for\nwriting down his own Hebrew books on morals (Epistle On\nAnimals, Iggeret ba\u2018aley hayyim) and on\nmathematics (Book of Kings, Sefer ha-melakim: see\nL\u00e9vy 1996, 69).\n\nThe supposed connection between the Epistle of the Brethren of\nPurity and the Ismailism should have suggested the adoption of\nthis work as one of the main sources of the so-called \u201cJewish\nIsmailism\u201d as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism. This\n\u201cJewish Ismailism\u201d consisted in adapting to Judaism some\nIsmaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics (Kiener\n1984). There are a number of cases showing that the Brethren of Purity\ninfluenced some Yemenite Jewish philosophers and authors in the period\n1150\u20131550 (Langermann 1996). For example, chapter two of the\nJudaeo-Arabic theologic-philosophical work by Natanael Ibn al-Fayyumi,\nthe Garden of Intellects (Bustan al-\u2018uqul),\nwritten in Yemen in 1165, includes a correspondence between numbers\n1\u201310 and ten scientific and philosophical concepts (soul\u2019s\nfaculties, senses, directions, bodily substances and parts, etc.) most\nof which are identical to those listed by the Brethren of Purity. Some\ntraces of the Brethren\u2019s doctrine of the procession of beings\nfrom the First Intellect, as well as of their numerology, are found in\ntwo Yemenite philosophical midrashim, i.e. Judaeo-Arabic\ninterpretations of Biblical texts, written in 1420\u20131430: the\nGlad Learning (Midrash ha-hefez) by Zerahyah\nha-Rof\u00e9 (Yahya al-Tabib) and the Lamp of Intellects\n(Siraj al-\u2018uqul) by Hoter ben Solomon (Mansur ibn\nSulayman al-Dhamari) (see Blumenthal 2007).\n",
