Thus,\nconstitutions are to be replaced, altered, or renewed pursuant to\nhumans\u2019 intellectual, political, and moral progress.\n\nTo James Madison (6 Sept. 1789), Jefferson writes:\n\n\nThe question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind another\n\u2026 is a question of such consequences as not only to merit\ndecision, but place also, among the fundamental principles of every\n government.[25]\n\n\nBeginning with the evident proposition\u2014\u201cthe earth belongs\nin usufruct to the living\u201d\u2014Jefferson aims to prove that\nthe deeds of each generation, defined by a nineteen-year\n period,[26]\n ought to be independent (or relatively so) of each other. Moreover,\n\u201cusufruct\u201d implies that each generation has an obligation\nto leave behind their property to the subsequent generation at least\nin the same condition in which it was received. For instance, any\ndebts one incurs while owning some land are not to be inherited by\nanother who obtains possession of that land after the former passes.\nWhat applies to individuals applies to any collection of\nindividuals.\n\nTo instantiate the principle, there must be a period of adjustment.\nPresent debts will be a matter of honor and expediency; future debts\nwill be constrained by the principle. To constrain future debts, a\nconstitution ought to stipulate that a nation can borrow no more than\nit can repay in the span of a generation. Temperate borrowing would\n\u201cbridle the spirit of war,\u201d inflamed much by the neglect\nof repayment of debts.\n\nUsufruct theoretically fits neatly with Jefferson\u2019s notions of\npolitical progress and of periodic constitutional renewal. Concerning\nthe latter, he writes to C.F.W. Dumas (10 Sept. 1787):\n\n\nNo society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law.\n\u2026 Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at\nthe end of 19. years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force\nand not of right.\n\n\nAt the end of nineteen years, there will be a constitutional\nconvention, at which defects in laws can be addressed and changes can\nbe\n made.[27]\n Should the principle of usufruct be adopted, republican government\nwould have a built-in mechanism for obviating\n revolutions.[28]\n Without the debts and wars of one generation passed on to the next in\na Jeffersonian republic and with that republic\u2019s constitution\nbeing renewed each generation to accommodate the needs and advances of\nthe next generation, Jefferson thinks, the stage is set for political\nprogress.\n\nJames Madison wrote a lengthy letter several months later (4 Feb.\n1790) in reply to Jefferson\u2019s usufruct letter, and politely\nproffered \u201csome very powerful objections.\u201d Jefferson never\nanswered that letter, though he never renounced generational\nsovereignty.\n",
