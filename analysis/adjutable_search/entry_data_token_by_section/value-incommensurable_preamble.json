    "main_text": "\n\nValues, such as liberty and equality, are sometimes said to be\nincommensurable in the sense that their value cannot be reduced to a\ncommon measure. And options, such as studying to become a lawyer or\nstudying to become a philosopher, are sometimes said to be\nincomparable in the sense that neither option seems to be at least as\ngood as the other. These possibilities are thought to raise deep\nquestions about practical reason and rational choice as well as\nrelated questions concerning topics as diverse as akrasia,\nmoral dilemmas, the plausibility of utilitarianism, and the\nfoundations of liberalism. This entry outlines answers in the\ncontemporary literature to these questions, starting with questions\nabout the nature and possibility of these phenomena.\n",
