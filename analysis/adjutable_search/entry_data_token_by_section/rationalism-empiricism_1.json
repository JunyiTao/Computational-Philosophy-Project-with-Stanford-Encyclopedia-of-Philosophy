    "main_text": "Introduction || Rationalism\n1.1 Rationalism\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis, and the\nInnate Concept thesis are essential to rationalism. Since the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis is equally important to empiricism, the\nfocus in what follows will be on the other two theses. To be a\nrationalist is to adopt at least one of them: either the Innate\nKnowledge thesis, regarding our presumed propositional innate\nknowledge, or the Innate Concept thesis, regarding our supposed innate\nknowledge of concepts.\n\nRationalists vary the strength of their view by adjusting their\nunderstanding of warrant. Some take warranted beliefs to be beyond\neven the slightest doubt and claim that intuition provide beliefs of\nthis high epistemic status. Others interpret warrant more\nconservatively, say as belief beyond a reasonable doubt, and claim\nthat intuition provide beliefs of that caliber. Still another\ndimension of rationalism depends on how its proponents understand the\nconnection between intuition, on the one hand, and truth, on the\nother. Some take intuition to be infallible, claiming that whatever we\nintuit must be true. Others allow for the possibility of false\nintuited propositions.\n\nTwo other closely related theses are generally adopted by\nrationalists, although one can certainly be a rationalist without\nadopting either of them. The first is that sense experience cannot\nprovide what we gain from reason.\n\nThe Indispensability of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain\nin subject area, S, by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas\nand instances of knowledge in S that are innate to us, could not have\nbeen gained by us through sense experience.\n\n\nThe second is that reason is superior to sense experience as a source\nof knowledge.\n\nThe Superiority of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain in\nsubject area S by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior\nto any knowledge gained by sense experience.\n\n\nHow reason is superior needs explanation, and rationalists have\noffered different accounts. One view, generally associated with\nDescartes (Rules, Rule II and Rule III, pp. 1\u20134), is\nthat what we know by intuition is certain, beyond even the\nslightest doubt, while what we believe, or even know, on the basis of\nsense experience is at least somewhat uncertain. Another view,\ngenerally associated with Plato (Republic 479e-484c), locates\nthe superiority of a priori knowledge in the objects known.\nWhat we know by reason alone, a Platonic form, say, is superior in an\nimportant metaphysical way, e.g. unchanging, eternal, perfect, a\nhigher degree of being, to what we are aware of through sense\nexperience.\n\nMost forms of rationalism involve notable commitments to other\nphilosophical positions. One is a commitment to the denial of\nscepticism for at least some area of knowledge. If we claim to know\nsome truths by intuition or deduction or to have some innate\nknowledge, we obviously reject scepticism with regard to those truths.\nRationalism in the form of the Intuition/Deduction thesis is also\ncommitted to epistemic foundationalism, the view that we know some\ntruths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we\nthen use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.\n",
