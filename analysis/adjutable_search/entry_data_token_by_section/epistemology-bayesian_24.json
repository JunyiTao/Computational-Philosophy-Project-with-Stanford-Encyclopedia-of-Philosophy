    "main_text": "Issues about Diachronic Norms || Old Evidence\n5.1 Old Evidence\n\nLet\u2019s start with the problem of old evidence, which was\npresented above (in the tutorial\n section 1.8)\n but is reproduced below for ease of reference:\n\n\nExample (Mercury). It is 1915. Einstein has\njust developed a new theory, General Relativity. He assesses the new\ntheory with respect to some old data that have been known for at least\nfifty years: the anomalous rate of the advance of Mercury\u2019s\nperihelion (which is the point on Mercury\u2019s orbit that is\nclosest to the Sun). After some derivations and calculations, Einstein\nsoon recognizes that his new theory entails the old data about the\nadvance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion, while the Newtonian theory does\nnot. Now, Einstein increases his credence in his new theory, and\nrightly so.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be no change in the body of Einstein\u2019s evidence\nwhen he is simply doing some derivations and calculations. But the\nlimiting case of no new evidence seems to be just the case in\nwhich the new evidence E is trivial, being a logical truth,\nruling out no possibilities. Now, conditionalization on new evidence\nE as a logical truth changes no credence; but Einstein changes\nhis credences nonetheless\u2014and rightly so. This is called the\nproblem of old evidence, formulated as a counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization.\n\nTo save the Principle of Conditionalization, a standard reply is to\nnote that Einstein seems to discover something new, a logical\nfact:\n\n\n\\((E_\\textrm{logical})\\) The new theory, together with such and\nsuch auxiliary hypotheses, logically implies such and such old\nevidence.\n\n\n\nThe hope is that, once this proposition has a less-than-certain\ncredence, Einstein\u2019s credence change can then be explained and\njustified as a result of conditionalization on this proposition\n(Garber 1983, Jeffrey 1983, and Niiniluoto 1983). There are four\nworries about this approach.\n\nAn initial worry is that the discovery of the logical fact\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\) does not sound like adding anything to the body\nof Einstein\u2019s evidence but seems only to make clear the\nevidential relation between the new theory and the existing,\nunaugmented body of evidence. If so, there is no new evidence after\nall. This worry might be addressed by providing a modified version of\nthe Conditionalization Principle, according to which the thing to be\nconditionalized on is not exactly what one acquires as new evidence\nbut, rather, what one learns. Indeed, it seems to sound\nnatural to say that Einstein learns something nontrivial from his\nderivations. For more on the difference between learning and acquiring\nevidence, see Maher (1992: secs 2.1 and 2.3). So this approach to the\nproblem of old evidence is often called logical learning.\n\nA second worry for the logical learning approach points to an internal\ntension: On the one hand, this approach has to work by permitting a\nless-than-certain credence in a logical fact such as\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), and that amounts to permitting one to make a\ncertain kind of logical error. On the other hand, this approach has\nbeen developed on the assumption of Probabilism, which seems to\nrequire that one be logically omniscient and make no logical error (as\nmentioned in the tutorial\n section 1.9).\n van Fraassen (1988) argues that these two aspects of the logical\nlearning approach contradict each other under some weak\nassumptions.\n\nA third worry is that the logical learning approach depends for its\nsuccess on certain questionable assumptions about prior credences. For\ncriticisms of those assumptions as well as possible improvements, see\nSprenger (2015), Hartmann & Fitelson (2015), and Eva &\nHartmann (2020).\n\nThere is a fourth worry, which deserves a subsection of its own.\n\n",
