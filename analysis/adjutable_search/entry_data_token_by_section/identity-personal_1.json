    "main_text": "Understanding the Persistence Question\n2. Understanding the Persistence Question\n\nTurn now to the persistence question. Few concepts have led to more\nmisunderstanding than identity over time. The persistence question is\noften confused with others or stated in a tendentious way.\n\nIt asks roughly what is necessary and sufficient for a past or future\nbeing to be someone existing now. If we point to you now, then\ndescribe someone or something existing at another time, we can ask\nwhether we are referring twice to one thing or once to each of two\nthings. The persistence question is what determines the answer to such\nqueries. (And there are precisely analogous questions about the\npersistence of other things, such as dogs or stones.)\n\nHere are three common misunderstandings of this question. Some take it\nto ask what it means to say that a past or future being is\nyou. This would imply that we can answer it simply by reflecting on\nour linguistic knowledge\u2014on what we mean by the word\n\u2018person\u2019, for example. The answer would be knowable a\npriori. It would also imply that necessarily all people have the same\npersistence conditions\u2014that the answer to the question is the\nsame no matter what sort of people we considered. Though some endorse\nthese claims (Noonan 2019b: 84\u201393), they are disputed. What it takes\nfor us to persist might depend on whether we are biological organisms,\nwhich we cannot know a priori. And if there could be immaterial\npeople\u2014gods or angels, say\u2014what it takes for them to\npersist might differ from what it takes for a human person to persist.\nIn that case our persistence conditions could not be established by\nlinguistic or conceptual analysis.\n\nSecond, the persistence question is often confused with the question\nof what it takes for someone to remain the same person (as in\nthis passage by Bertrand Russell (1957: 70): \u201cBefore we can\nprofitably discuss whether we shall continue to exist after death, it\nis well to be clear as to the sense in which a man is the same person\nas he was yesterday.\u201d) If Baffles were to change in certain\nways\u2014if she lost much of her memory, say, or changed\ndramatically in character, or became severely disabled\u2014we might\nask whether she would still be the person she was before, or instead\nbecome a different person. This is not a question about\npersistence\u2014about numerical identity over time. To ask whether\nBaffles is the same person that she was before, or to say\nthat she is a different person from the one she used to be,\npresupposes that she herself existed at the earlier time. The question\narises only when numerical identity is assumed. To ask about\nBaffles\u2019 persistence, by contrast, is to ask not whether she has\ncontinued to be the same person, but whether she has continued to\nexist at all.\n\nWhen we speak of someone\u2019s remaining the same person or becoming\na different one, we mean remaining or ceasing to be a certain\nsort of person. For someone no longer to be the same person\nis for her still to exist, but to have changed in some important way.\nThis typically has to do with her individual identity in the sense of\nthe characterization question\u2014with changes in respect of those\nproperties that \u201cdefine someone as a person.\u201d\n\nThird, the persistence question is often taken to ask what it takes\nfor the same person to exist at two different times. The most common\nformulation is something like this:\n\nIf a person x exists at one time and a person y\nexists at another time, under what possible circumstances is it the\ncase that x is y?\n\n\nThis asks, in effect, what it takes for a past or future person to be\nyou, or for you to continue existing as a person. We have a\nperson existing at one time and a person existing at another, and the\nquestion is what is necessary and sufficient for them to be one person\nrather than two.\n\nThis is narrower than the persistence question. We may want to know\nwhether each of us was ever an embryo, or whether we could survive in\nan irreversible vegetative state (where the resulting being is\nbiologically alive but has no mental properties). These are clearly\nquestions about what it takes for us to persist. But as personhood is\nmost commonly defined (recall Locke\u2019s definition quoted\nearlier), something is a person at a given time only if it has certain\nspecial mental properties at that time. Embryos and human beings in a\nvegetative state, having no mental properties at all, are thus not\npeople when they\u2019re in that condition. And in that case we\ncannot infer anything about whether you were once an embryo or could\nexist in a vegetative state from a principle about what it takes for a\npast or future person to be you.\n\nWe can illustrate the point by considering this answer to question\n1:\n\nNecessarily, a person x existing at one time is a person\ny existing at another time if and only if x can, at\nthe first time, remember an experience y has at the second\ntime, or vice versa.\n\n\nThat is, a past or future person is you just if you (who are now a\nperson) can now remember an experience she had then, or she can then\nremember an experience you\u2019re having now. Call this the\nmemory criterion. (It too is often attributed to Locke,\nthough it\u2019s uncertain whether he actually held it: see Behan\n1979.)\n\nThe memory criterion may seem to imply that if you were to lapse into\nan irreversible vegetative state, you would cease to exist (or perhaps\npass to the next world): the resulting being could not be you because\nit would not remember anything. But no such conclusion follows.\nAssuming that an organism in a vegetative state is not a person, this\nis not a case involving a person existing at one time and a person\nexisting at another time. The memory criterion can only tell us which\npast or future person you are, not which past or future being\ngenerally. It says what it takes for someone to persist as a\nperson, but not what it takes for someone to persist without\nqualification. So it implies nothing about whether you could exist in\na vegetative state or even as a corpse, or whether you were once an\nembryo. As stated, it\u2019s compatible with your surviving with no\nmemory continuity at all, as long as this happens when you are not a\nperson (Olson 1997: 22\u201326, Mackie 1999: 224\u2013228).\n\nNo advocate of the memory criterion would accept this. The view is\nintended to imply that if a person x exists now and a being\ny exists at another time\u2014whether or not it\u2019s a\nperson then\u2014they are one just if x can now remember an\nexperience y has at the other time or vice versa. But this\nnot an answer to Question 1: what it takes for a person existing at\none time and a person existing at another time to be one rather than\ntwo. It\u2019s an answer to a more general question: what it takes\nfor something that is a person at one time to exist at another time as\nwell, whether or not it\u2019s a person then:\n\nIf a person x exists at one time and something y\nexists at another time, under what possible circumstances is it the\ncase that x is y?\n\n\nThose who ask Question 1 are commonly assuming that every person is a\nperson essentially: nothing that is in fact a person could\npossibly exist without being a person. (By contrast, no student is a\nstudent essentially: something that is in fact a student can exist\nwithout being a student.) This claim, \u201cperson\nessentialism,\u201d implies that whatever is a person at one time\nmust be a person at every time when she exists, making Questions 1 and\n2 equivalent.\n\nBut person essentialism is controversial (Olson and Witt 2020).\nCombined with a Lockean account of personhood, it implies that you\nwere never an embryo: at best you may have come into being when the\nembryo that gave rise to you developed certain mental capacities. Nor\ncould you exist in a vegetative state. It rules out the brute-physical\nview described in the next section. Whether we were once embryos or\ncould exist in a vegetative state, or whether we are people\nessentially, would seem to be substantive questions that an account of\nour persistence should answer, not matters to be presupposed in the\nway we frame the debate.\n",
