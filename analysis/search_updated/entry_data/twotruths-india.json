    "preamble": "\n\nThe theory of the two truths has a twenty-five century long history\nbehind it. It has its origin in the sixth century\n BCE[1]\n India with the emergence of the Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama. It is said,\naccording to the Pit\u0101p\u016btrasam\u0101gama-s\u016btra,\nSiddh\u0101rtha became a buddha \u201cawakened one\u201d because he\nfully understood the meaning of the two truths\u2014conventional\ntruth (sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti-satya) and ultimate truth\n(param\u0101rtha-satya)\u2014and that the reality of all the objects\nof knowledge, the text says, is exhaustively comprised of the two\ntruths (Sde Dge, dkon brtsegs nga, 60b). The theory of the\ntwo truths, according to the\nSam\u0101dhir\u0101ja-s\u016btra, is a unique contribution\nmade by the Buddha towards Indian philosophy. This text states:\n\u201cthe knower of the world, without hearing it from others, taught\nthat there are the two truths\u201d (Sde dge, mdo-sde da\n174b\u2013210b). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, in his\nM\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 [MMK], attributes the two\ntruths to the Buddha as follows: \u201cthe Dharma taught by the\nbuddhas is precisely based on the two truths: a truth of mundane\nconventions and a truth of the ultimate\u201d ([MMK] 24:8).\n\nThe Madhyamaka philosophers claim the theory of the two truths is the\nheart of the Buddha\u2019s philosophy. According to them, it serves as the\nmirror reflecting the core message of the Buddha\u2019s teachings and the\nmassive philosophical literature it inspired. At the heart of the\ntheory of the two truths is the Buddha\u2019s ever poignant existential and\nsoteriological concerns about the reality of things and of life.\nNirv\u0101\u1e47 ultimate freedom from the suffering conditioned by\ndesires, is only ever achieved, according to the theory of the two\ntruths, from a correct understanding of two truths. Knowledge of the\nconventional truth informs us how things are conventional, from the\nordinary commonsense perspective and thus grounds our epistemic\npractice in its proper linguistic and conceptual conventional\nframework. Knowledge of the ultimate truth informs us of how things\nreally are ultimate, from the ultimate analytical perspective and so\ntakes our minds beyond the bounds of conceptual and linguistic\nconventions.\n\nIn the theory of the two truths, as we know it today, maybe unknown to\nthe earliest start of Buddhist thought in India. Contemporary\nscholarship suggests that the Buddha himself may not have made any\nexplicit reference to the two truths. The early textual materials such\nas Pali Nik\u0101yas and \u0101gamas ascribe to the Buddha does not\nmake explicit mention of the distinction of the two truths. Recent\nstudies also suggest that the two truths distinction is an innovation\non the part of the Abhidhamma which came into prominence originally as\na heuristic device, useful for later interpreters to reconcile\napparent inconsistent statements in the Buddha\u2019s teachings\n(Karunadasa, 2006: 1; 1996: 25\u20136 and n.139, The Cowherds, 2011; 5).\nThis distinction is however not entirely disconnected from the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings. The antecedent hermeneutic distinctions drawn in\nthe A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya (AN II.60) between two linguistic\nconcepts (pa\u00f1\u00f1atti) \u2013 nitattha (Skt.\nnit\u0101rtha) and neyyatta (Skt. ney\u0101rtha)\n\u2013 provides us with a useful insight into the rationale basis\nfrom which later develops the formulation of the two truths\ndistinction. This latter pair of terms deals with the hermeneutic\nstrategies explaining the purported meaning of the Buddhist scriptural\nstatements. Nitattha is a statement the meaning of which is\n\u201cdrawn out\u201d (nita-attha), definitive and explicit,\ntaken as its stands, and neyyattha is a statement the meaning of which\nis \u201cto be drawn out\u201d (neyya-attha) and interpretive\n(Karunadasa, 1996: 25). The commentary (A\u1e45guttaranik\u0101ya\nA\u1e6d\u1e6dhakatah II.118) on the A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya\nII.60 explores nitattha/neyyattha distinction\u2019s connection with the\nsammuti/paramattha distinction. This simple heuristic device however\nstimulated rich philosophical exchanges amongst the Buddhist\nphilosophers and practitioners, not to mention the exchanges with\ntraditional Hindu thinkers. The exchange of different ideas and views\nof the two truths between the early Buddhists, among other factors,\ngave birth to Buddhism as the philosophy we know today. The\ntransformation of the two truths theory from a simple hermeneutic\nstrategy to a complex system of thought with highly sophisticated\nontological, epistemological and semantic theories blurring a clear\nmethodological distinction between \u201creality\u201d and\n\u201ctruth\u201d. As always two terms \u2013 reality and truth\n\u2013 are expressed with one Sanskrit term satya; often\nreality/truth is seen as having an interchangeable usage and meaning.\nThis philosophical development is perhaps the most significant\ncontribution resulting from the schisms the Buddhism experienced after\nthe Buddha passed away (ca. 380 BCE). Various schools with varying\ninterpretations of the Buddha\u2019s words soon appeared in Buddhism, which\nresulted in a rich and vibrant philosophical and hermeneutic\natmosphere.\n\nIn later years, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika) and\nSautr\u0101ntika, Madhyamaka (from the first century CE onwards) and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra (ca. sixth century CE onwards) became the dominant\nschools. Our investigation of the theory of the two truths will\nbriefly focus on how these schools have received, interpreted and\nunderstood it. Although all these schools regard the theory of two\ntruths as the centrepiece of the Buddha\u2019s philosophy, all have\nnevertheless adopted very different approaches to the theory. As we\nshall see each understood and interpreted the two truths in different\nways, and are often fundamentally and radically opposed to each\nother.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. \u0100bhidharmikas / Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika)\n\nIn the fourth century, Vasubandhu undertook a comprehensive survey of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da School\u2019s thought, and wrote a compendium,\nTreasury of Knowledge,\n(Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101 [AK]; Mngon pa\nku 1b\u201325a) with his own Commentary on the Treasury of\nKnowledge (Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya [AKB],\nMngon pa ku 26b\u2013258a). This commentary not only offers\nan excellent account of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din views, including\nthe theory of the two truths, but also offers a sharp critique of many\nviews held by the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins. Vasubandhu based his\ncommentary on the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (The\nGreat Commentary), as the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins held their\nphilosophical positions according to the teachings of the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. Consequently,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins are often known as\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\u2019s\n ontology[2]\n or the theory of the two truths makes two fundamental claims.\n\nthe claim that the ultimate reality consists of irreducible\nspatial units (e.g., atoms of the material category) and irreducible\ntemporal units (e.g., point-instant consciousnesses) of the five basic\ncategories, and\nthe claim that the conventional reality consists of reducible\nspatial wholes or temporal continua.\n\n\nTo put the matter straightforwardly, for the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins,\nwholes and continua are only conventionally real, whereas the atoms\nand point-instant consciousness are only ultimately real.\n1.1 Conventional truth\n\nTo see how the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins defend these two claims, we\nshall have a close look at their definitions of the two truths. We\nwill examine conventional truth first. This will provide the argument\nin support of the second claim. In the Abhidharmako\u015ba\nVasubandu defines conventional truth/reality as follows: \u201cAn\nentity, the cognition of which does not arise when it is destroyed\nand, mentally divided, is conventionally existent like a pot and\nwater. Ultimate existence is otherwise.\u201d ([AK] 6.4, Mngon\npa khu 7ab) Whatever is, on this definition, designated as\n\u201cconventionally existent\u201d is taken to be\n\u201cconventionally real\u201d or conventional truth when the idea\nor concept of which ceases to arise when it is physically destroyed,\nby means of a hammer for instance. Or its properties such as shape are\nstripped away from it by means of subjecting it under analysis,\nthereby conceptually excluding them. A pot and water are designated as\nconventionally existent therefore conventionally real for the concept\n\u201cpot\u201d ceases to exist when it is destroyed physically, and\nthe concept \u201cwater\u201d no longer arises when we conceptually\nexclude from it its shape, colour etc.\n\nOn the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din definition, for an entity to be real,\nit does not need to be ultimately real, exclusively. For a thing to be\nultimately real is for that thing to be \u201cfoundationally\nexistent\u201d (dravya-sat / rdzas\n yod)[3]\n in contrast with being \u201ccompositely existent\u201d\n(avayavidravya / rdzas grub). By \u201cfoundationally existent\u201d\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din refer to the entity which is fundamentally\nreal, the concept or the cognition of which is not dependent on\nconceptual construction, hence not conceptually existent\n(praj\u00f1aptisat) nor a composition of the aggregative phenomena.\nIn the case of foundational existent there always remains something\nirreducible to which the concept of the thing applies, hence it is\nultimately real. A simple entity is not reducible to conceptual forms,\nor conventional designations, nor is it compositely existent entity.\nWe will have lot more to say on this point shortly.\n\nPot and water are not the foundational entities. They are rather\ncomposite entities (avayavi-dravya / rdzas grub). By composite entity,\nwe mean an entity or existent which is not fundamental, primary or\nsimple, but is rather a conceptually constructed\n(praj\u00f1aptisat), composition of various properties, and is thus\nreducible both physically and logically.\n\nHence for the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din, conventional reality\n(samv\u1e5btisatya), composite-existence (avayavi-dravya / rdzas\ngrub), and the lack of intrinsic reality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va) are\nall equivalents. A conventional reality is therefore characterised as\na reducible conventional entity on three grounds: (i) conventional\nreality is both physically and logically reducible, as it\ndisintegrates when it is subjected to physical destruction and\ndisappears from our minds when its parts are separated from it by\nlogical analysis; (ii) conventional reality borrows its identity from\nother things including its parts, concepts etc., it does not exist\nindependently in virtue of its intrinsic reality\n(ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va), the exclusion of its parts and concepts thus\naffects and reduces its inherent nature; and (iii) conventional\nreality is a product of mental constructions, like that of\nconventionally real wholes, causation, continuum etc, and it does not\nexists intrinsically.\n1.2 Ultimate truth\n\nThe definition of the ultimate reality, as we shall see, offers the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din response to the claim that ultimate reality\nconsists of irreducible atoms and point-instant moments. In glossing\nthe [AK] 6.4 verse his commentary explains that ultimate reality is\nregarded as ultimately existent, one that is both physically and\nlogically irreducible. Vasubandhu supplies three arguments to support\nthis: (i) ultimate reality is both physically and logically\nirreducible, as it does not disintegrate when it is subjected to\nphysical destruction and that its identity does not disappear when its\nparts are separated from it under logical analysis; and (ii) ultimate\nreality does not borrow its nature from other things including its\nparts. Rather it exists independently in virtue of its intrinsic\nreality (svabh\u0101va), the exclusion of its parts thus does\nnot affect its inherent nature; and (iii) it is not a product of\nmental constructions, like that of conventionally real wholes,\ncausation, continuum etc. It exists intrinsically ([AKB] 6.4,\nMngon pa khu 214a).\n\nUltimate reality is of two types: the compounded\n(sa\u1e41sk\u1e5bta) ultimate, and the uncompounded\n(asa\u1e41sk\u1e5bta) ultimate. The uncompounded ultimate consists\nof (a) space (ak\u0101\u015ba), and (b)\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014analytical cessation\n(pratisa\u1e41ky\u0101-nirodha) and non-analytical cessation\n(apratisa\u1e41khy\u0101-nirodha). These three ultimates are\nuncompounded as each is seen as being causally unconditioned. They are\nnonspatial concepts. These concepts do not have any physical referent\nwhatsoever. Space is a mere absence of entity. Analytical and\nnonanalytical cessations are the two forms of nirv\u0101\u1e47a,\nwhich is simply freedom from afflictive suffering, or the elimination\nof afflictive suffering. These concepts are not associated in positing\nany thing that can be described as remotely physical. They are thus\nthe concepts that are irreducible physically and logically.\n\nThe compounded ultimate consists of the five aggregates\u2014material\naggregate (r\u016bpa), feeling aggregate (vedan\u0101),\nperception-aggregate (sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101), dispositional\naggregate (sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra), and consciousness-aggregate\n(vij\u00f1\u0101na)\u2014since they are causally produced, and the\nideas of each aggregate are conceived individually rather than\ncollectively. If the aggregates, the ideas of which are conceived\ncollectively as a whole(s) or a continuum/continua, they could not be\nultimately real. The collective concepts of the aggregate as a\n\u201cwhole\u201d or as a \u201ccontinuum\u201d subject to\ncessation as they cease to appear to the mind, get excluded from the\nconceptual framework of the reality of the five aggregates when they\nare logically analysed.\n2. Sautr\u0101ntika\n\nThe\n philosophers[4]\n who championed this view are some of the best-known Indian logicians\nand epistemologists. Other great names who propogated the tradition\ninclude Devendrabuddhi (?), \u015a\u0101khyabuddhi (?), Vinitadeva\n(630\u2013700), Dharmottara (750\u2013810), Mok\u1e63akaragupt (ca.\n1100\u20131200). Dign\u0101ga (480\u2013540) and Dharmak\u012brti\n(600\u2013660) are credited to have founded this school. For the\ntheory of the two truths in the Sautr\u0101ntika we will need to rely\non the following texts:\n\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s Compendium of Epistemology\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya, Tshad ma ce\n1b\u201313a),\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s Auto-commentary on the Compendium of\nEpistemology (Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccayav\u1e5btti, Tshad\nma ce 14b\u201385b),\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Verses on Epistemology\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikak\u0101rik\u0101 [PVK];\ntshad ma ce 94b\u2013151a),\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Commentary on the Verses of\nEpistemology (Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikav\u1e5btti\n[PVT]; tshad ma ce 261b\u2013365a),\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Ascertainment of Epistemology\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya, tshad ma ce\n152b\u2013230a),\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Dose of Logical Reasoning\n(Ny\u0101yabindu, tshad ma ce 231b\u2013238a).\n\n\nBroadly, all objects of knowledge are classified into two realities\nbased on the ways in which right-cognition (pram\u0101\u1e47a)\nengages with its object. They are either directly accessible\n(pratyak\u1e63a), which constitutes objects that are obvious\nto cognition, or they are directly inaccessible\n(parok\u1e63a), which constitutes objects that are occulted,\nor obscured from cognition. A directly accessible object is\nprincipally known by a direct perceptual right-cognition\n(pratya\u1e63a-pram\u0101\u1e47a), whereas a directly inaccessible\nobject is principally known by an inferential right-cognition\n(anum\u0101na-pram\u0101\u1e47a).\n2.1 Ultimate truth\n\nOf the two types of objects, some are ultimately real while others are\nonly conventionally real, and some are not even conventionally real,\nthey are just unreal, or fictions. In defining ultimate truth in the\nSautr\u0101ntika tradition, we read in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Verses on\nEpistemology: \u201cThat which is ultimately causally efficient is\nhere an ultimately existent (param\u0101rthasat). Conventionally\nexistent (sa\u1e41v\u1e5btisat) is otherwise. They are declared as\nthe definitions of the unique particular (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) and\nthe universal (s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a)\u201d\n(Dharmak\u012brti [PVK] Tshad ma ce 118b).\n\nUltimate truth is, on this definition, a phenomenon (dharma) that is\nultimately existent, and ultimately existent are ultimately causally\nefficient. Phenomenon that is ultimately causally efficient is\nintrinsically or objectively real, existing in and of itself as a\n\u201cunique particular\u201d\n (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a).[5]\n By \u201cunique particular\u201d Dharmak\u012brti means ultimately\nreal phenomenon\u2014dharma that is self-defined, uniquely\nindividual, objectively real, existing independent of any conceptual\nfabrication, ultimately causally efficient (artha), a dharma which\nserves as an objects of direct perception, dharma that presents itself\nto the cognitions as distinctive/unique individuals.\n\nIn the Commentary on the Verses of Epistemology, Dharmak\u012brti\ncharacterises (Tshad ma ce 274b\u2013279b) all ultimately\nreal unique particulars exist as distinct individuals with their own\nintrinsic natures. And they satisfy three criteria:\n\nThey have determinate spatial locations (de\u015baniyata / yul\nnges pa) of their own, as real things do not have a shared property\namongst themselves. The real fire we see is either near or far, or at\nthe left or the right, or at the back or in the front. By contrast,\nthe universal\n fireness[6],\n that is, the concept of being a fire, does not occupy a determinate\nposition.\nUnique particulars are temporally determinate (k\u0101laniyata /\ndus nges pa or dus ma \u2018dres pa). They are only momentary\ninstants. They spontaneously go out of existence the moment they have\ncome into existence. This is not the case with the universals. Being\npurely conceptually constructed, they remain uninfluenced by the\ndynamism of causal conditions and hence are not affected by time.\nUnique particulars are ontologically determinate\n(\u0101k\u0101raniyata / ngo bo nges pa / ngo bo ma \u2018dres pa) as\nthey are causally conditioned; the effects of the aggregation of the\ncausal conditions that have the ability to produce them. When those\ncausal conditions come together at certain points in time, unique\nparticulars come into existence. When those conditions disintegrate\nand are not replaced by new conditions, unique particulars go out of\nexistence. When the conditions have not yet come together, unique\nparticulars are yet to obtain their ontological status.\n\n\nSo \u201cdeterminate intrinsic natures of the unique\nparticulars,\u201d Dharmak\u012brti argues in Commentary on the\nVerses of Epistemology, \u201care not accidental or fortuitous since\nwhat is not determinate cannot be spatially, temporally and\nontologically determinate\u201d (Tshad ma ce 179a).\n\nThe unique particulars are, Sautr\u0101ntika claims, ultimately real,\nand they supply us four arguments to support the claim:\n\n(1) Unique particulars are causally efficient phenomena\n(arthakriy\u0101samartha) ([PVT] Tshad ma ce 179a) because:\n(a) they have ability to serve pragmatic purpose of life\u2014fulfil\nthe objectives in our life, and (b) ability to produce a variety of\ncognitive images due to their remoteness or proximity. (Dharmottara\u2019s\nNy\u0101bindu\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 Tshad ma we 36b\u201392a)\nBoth of these abilities must be associated exclusively with objects of\ndirect perception (Tshad ma we 45a).\n\n(2) Unique particulars present themselves only to a direct perceptual\ncognition as distinct and uniquely defined individuals because unique\nparticulars are, as Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Ny\u0101yabindu points\nout \u201cthe objects whose nearness or remoteness presents the\ndifference of cognitive image\u201d (Tshad ma ce 231a) and\nthat object alone which produces the impression of vividness according\nto its remoteness or proximity, exists ultimately\n(DharmottaraTshad ma we 44b\u201345a).\n\n(3) Unique particulars are not denotable by language since they are\nbeyond the full grasp of any conceptual mind\n(\u015babdasy\u0101vi\u015baya). Although unique particulars are\nobjective references of language and thought, and we may have firm\nbeliefs about them, conceptual mind does not fully grasp their real\nnature. They are ultimately real, directly cognisable by means of\ncertain perceptions without reliance on other factors (nimitta) such\nas language and thought. Therefore they must exist. They are the sorts\nof phenomena whose cognition would not occur if they are not\nobjectively real.\n\nIn the Sautr\u0101ntika ontology ultimately real/existent (synonymous)\nunique particulars are classified into three kinds:\n\nmomentary instants of matter (r\u016bpa),\nmomentary instants of consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na) and\nmomentary instants of the non-associated composite phenomena,\nwhich are neither matter nor minds or mental factors\n(citta-caitta-viprayukta-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra).\n\n\nThe Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s theory of ultimate truth mirrors its ontology\nof flux in which unique particulars are viewed as spatially\ninfinitesimal atoms constituting temporally momentary events\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ika) or as successive flashes of consciousnesses,\ncognitive events, all devoid of any real continuity as substratum.\nUnique particulars are ultimately real, although they are not enduring\nsubstances (dravyas) inhering in it\u2019s qualities (gu\u1e47as) and\nactions (karmas) as the Naiy\u0101yika-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika claims.\nThey are rather bundles of events arising and disappearing instantly.\nEven continuity of things and motion are only successive events\nclosely resembling each other. On this theory ultimate realities are\nmomentary point instants, and Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti both\nargue that no conditioned phenomenon, therefore, no ultimately real\nunique particulars, endure more than a single moment\u2014hence they\nare momentary instants (k\u1e63a\u1e47ika).\n\nFour closely interrelated arguments provide the defence of the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s claim that ultimately real unique particulars are\nmomentary instants. Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti both employ the\nfirst two arguments. The third argument is one Dharmak\u012brti\nspecialises in his works.\n\n(1) Ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants because\ntheir perishing or destruction is spontaneous to their becoming. This\nfollows because (i) unique particulars are inherently self-destructive\n(Vasubandhu [AKB], Mngon pa khu 166b\u2013167a), and (ii)\ntheir perishing or cessation is intrinsic and does not depend\non any other extrinsic causal factors (Dharmak\u012brti,\n[PVK] Tshad ma ce 102a; [PVT], Tshad ma ce\n178ab).\n\n(2) The ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants\nbecause they are motionless, and do not move from one temporal or\nspatial location to another. They perish just where they were born\nsince nothing exists later than its acquisition of existence\n(Vasubandhu [AKB] Mngon pa khu 166b).\n\n(3) The third argument proves momentary instants of unique particulars\nfrom the inference of existence (sattv\u0101num\u0101na). This is a\ncase of the argument from identity of existence and production\n(svabh\u0101vahetu). All unique particulars which are ultimately\nexistent, are necessarily produced, since only those that are\nultimately existent, insofar as Dharmak\u012briti is concerned, are\nable to a perform causal function\u2014i.e., to produce effects. And\ncausally efficient unique particulars imply constant change for the\nrenewal and the perishing of their antecedent identities, therefore,\nthey are momentary.\n\nFinally (4), unique particulars are ultimately real not only on the\nground that they constitute the final ontological status, but also\nbecause it forms the basis of the Sautr\u0101ntika soteriology. The\nattainment of nirv\u0101\u1e47a \u2014 the ultimate freedom from the\nafflictions of life\u2014for the Sautr\u0101ntika, according to\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya, has an immediate\nperception of the unique particulars as its necessary condition\n(Tshad ma che 108b\u2013109a).\n2.2 Conventional truth\n\nDharmak\u012brti defines conventional truth, in his [PVK], as dharma\nwhich is \u201cconventionally existent\u201d and he identifies\nconventional truth with the \u201cuniversal\u201d\n (s\u0101m\u0101nya-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a)[7]\n just as he identifies ultimate truth with unique particular\n(Tshad ma ce 118b). When a Sautr\u0101ntika philosopher\ndescribes a certain entity as a universal, he means a conceptual\nentity not apprehended by virtue of its own being. He means a general\nproperty that is conceptually constructed, appearing to be something\ncommon amongst all items in a certain class of objects. Unlike\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view where universals are regarded as\nobjectively real and eternal entities inhering in substances,\nqualities and particulars, universals, for the Sautr\u0101ntika are\npure conceptual constructs. Sautr\u0101ntika holds the view known as\nnominalism or conceptualism\u2014the view that denies universals any\nindependent extramental objective reality existing on their own apart\nfrom being mentally constructed.\n\nWhile unique particulars exist independently of linguistic convention,\nuniversals have no reality in isolation from linguistic and conceptual\nconventions. Thus, universals and ultimate reality are mutually\nexclusive. Universals are therefore only conventionally real, lacking\nany intrinsic nature, whereas unique particulars are ultimately real,\nand exist intrinsically.\n\nThe Sautr\u0101ntika defends the claim that universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) are only conventional reality\nfor the following reasons (tshad ma ce 118b):\n\nUniversals are domains of inferential cognition since they are\nexhaustively grasped by conceptual mind by means of language and\nthought (Dharmak\u012brti, Ny\u0101yabindu, tshad ma\nce 231a).\nUniversals are objects of the apprehending cognition which arises\nsimply out of having beliefs about the objects without the need to see\nany real object.\nUniversals are causally inefficient. By \u201ccausal\ninefficiency,\u201d the Sautr\u0101ntika, according to Dharmottara\u2019s\nNy\u0101yabindu\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, (Tshad ma we\n45ab) means three things: (a) universals are purely conceptually\nconstructed, hence unreal; (b) universals are unable to serve a\npragmatic purpose as they do not fulfil life\u2019s objectives; and (c)\ncognitive images produced by universals are independent of the\nproximity between objects and their cognitions since production of\nimage does not require seeing the object as it is in the case of\nperception and unique particulars.\nUniversals are products of unifying or mixing of language and\ntheir referential objects (unique particulars), and thus appearing\nthem to conceptual minds as generalities, unified wholes, unity,\ncontinuity, as phenomena that appear to conceptual mind to having\nshared properties linking with all items in the same class of\nobjects.\nUniversals, consequently, obscure the individualities of unique\nparticulars from being directly apprehended. This is because, as we\nhave already seen, universals, according to Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s [PVK]\n(Tshad ma ce 97ab) and [PVT] (Tshad ma ce 282ab),\nare only conventionally real since they are conceptual constructs\nfounded on unifying and putting together the distinct individualities\nof unique particulars as having one common property being shared by\nall items in the same class.\n\n\nAccording to the Sautr\u0101ntika philosophy, language does not\ndescribe reality or unique particulars positively through real\nuniversals as suggested by the Naiy\u0101yikas. The Sautr\u0101ntika\ndeveloped an alternative nominalist theory of universal called the\napoha-theory in which language is seen to engage with reality\nnegatively by means of elimination or exclusion of the other\n(any\u0101poha / gzhan sel). On this theory, the function of language,\nspecifically naming, is to eliminate object from the class of\nthose objects to which language does not apply.\n\nIn brief the Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s theory of the two truths rests on\ndichotomising objects between unique particulars, which are understood\nas ultimately reals, dynamic, momentary, causally effective, the\nobjective domain of the direct perception; and universals, which are\nunderstood as only conventionally reals, conceptually constructed,\nstatic, causally ineffective and the objective domain of the\ninferential cognition.\n3. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\u2019s realistic theory of the two truths and the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory of the two truths both\naffirm the ultimate reality of physical objects constituted by atoms.\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra rejects physical realism of both the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and the Sautr\u0101ntika, although it agrees\nwith the Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory as far as they\nboth affirm representation as the intentional objects in perception\nand deny in perception a direct access to any external object. Where\nthey part their company is in their response to the questions: what\ncauses representations? Is the contact of senses with physical objects\nnecessary to give rise to representations in perception? The\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s reply is that external objects cause\nrepresentations, given that these representations are intentional\nobjects there is indeed a contact between senses and external objects.\nThis affirmative response allows the Sautr\u0101ntika to affirm\nreality of external objects. The Yog\u0101c\u0101rin however replies\nthat \u201csubliminal impressions\u201d (v\u0101san\u0101s) from\nfoundational consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) are the\ncauses of the mental representations, and given that these impressions\nare only internal phenomena acting as intentional objects, the contact\nbetween senses and external objects is therefore rejected even\nconventionally. This allows the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin to deny even\nconventional reality of all physical objects, and argue that all\nconventional realities are our mental representations, mental\ncreations, cognitions etc.\n\nThe central thesis in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy, the theory of\nthe two truths echoes is the assertion that all that is conventionally\nreal is only ideas, representations, images, creations of the mind,\nand that there is no conventionally real object that exists outside\nthe mind to which it corresponds. These ideas are only objects of any\ncognition. The whole universe is a mental universe. All physical\nobjects are only fiction, they are unreal even by the conventional\nstandard, similar to a dream, a mirage, a magical illusion, where what\nwe perceive are only products of our mind, without a real external\nexistence.\n\nInspired by the idealistic tendencies of various s\u016btras\nconsisting of important elements of the idealistic doctrines, in the\nthird and the fourth centuries many Indian philosophers developed and\nsystematised a coherent Idealist School. In the beginning of the\nVi\u1e43\u015batik\u0101 Vasubandhu treats citta,\nmanas, vij\u00f1\u0101na, vij\u00f1\u0101pti as\nsynonymous and uses these terms as the names of the idealistic school.\nThe chief founders were Maitreyan\u0101th (ca. 300) and\nAsa\u1e45ga (315\u2013390), propagated by Vasubandhu\n(320\u2013380), Dign\u0101ga (480\u2013540) Sthiramati (ca.\n500), Dharmap\u0101la (530\u2013561), Hiuan-tsang (602\u2013664),\nDharmak\u012brti (600\u2013660), \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n(ca.725\u2013788) and Kamala\u015b\u012bla (ca.740\u2013795). The\nlast two are Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-M\u0101dhyamikas in contrast with the\nearlier figures who are identified as Yog\u0101c\u0101rins.\n\nLike other Buddhist schools, the theory of the two truths captures the\ncentral Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrines. Maitreyan\u0101th asserts in his\nVerses on the Distinction Between Phenomena and Reality\n(Dharmadharmat\u0101vibha\u1e45ga-k\u0101rik\u0101,\nDDVK; Sems tsam phi 50b\u201353b)\u2014\u201cAll this is\nunderstood to be condensed in two categories: phenomena (dharma) and\nreality (dharmat\u0101) because they encompass all.\u201d\n(DDVK 2, Sems tsam phi) By \u201cAll\u201d\nYog\u0101c\u0101rin means every possible object of knowledge, and they\nare said to be contained in the two truths since objects are either\nconventional truth or ultimate truth. Things are either objects of\nconventional knowledge or objects of ultimate knowledge, and a third\ncategory is not admitted.\n3.1 Conventional Truth\n\nEtymologically the term conventional truth covers the sense of what we\nordinarily take as commonsensical truths. However, in contrast with\nna\u00efve realism associated with common sense notions of truths, for\nthe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra the term \u201cconventional truth\u201d has\nsomewhat a negative connotation. It exclusively refers to objects of\nknowledge like forms, sound etc., the mode of existence or mode of\nbeing which radically contradicts with the mode of its appearance, and\nthus they are false, unreal, and deceptive. Forms, sounds, etc., are\ndefined as conventional entities in that they are realities from the\nperspective of, or by the force of, three forms of convention:\n\nfabrication (asatkalpita),\nconsciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na), or\nlanguage, signifier, a convenient designator (\u015babda).\n\n\nA conventional truth is therefore a truth by virtue of being\nfabricated by the conceptual mind; or it is truth erroneously\napprehended by means of the dualistic consciousness; or it is true\nconcept, meaning, signified and designated by a convenient\ndesignator/signifier.\n\nBecause the Yog\u0101c\u0101rins admit three conventions, it also\nadmits three categories of conventional truths:\n\nfabricated phenomena;\nmind/consciousness; and\nlanguage since conventional truths exist due to the force of these\nthree conventions.\n\n\nThe first and the last are categories of imaginary phenomena\n(parikalpita) and the second is dependent phenomena (paratantra).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s claim that external objects are not even\nconventionally real, what is conventionally real are only our\nimpressions, and mental representations is one Vasubandhu closely\ndefends by means of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theory of the three\nnatures (trisvabh\u0101va). In his Discernment of the\nThree Natures (Trisvabh\u0101vak\u0101rik\u0101, or\nTrisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba [TSN]; Sems tsam shi\n10a\u201311b), Vasubandhu explains that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nontology and phenomenology as consisting of the unity of three natures\n(svabh\u0101va):\n\nthe dependent or other (paratantra);\nthe imaginary / conceptual (parikalpita); and\nthe perfect / ultimate (parini\u1e63panna) ([TSN] 1,\nSems tsam shi 10a)\n\n\nThe first two account for conventional truth and the latter ultimate\ntruth. We shall consider the import of the three in turn.\n\nFirst, Vasubandhu defines the dependent nature as: (a) one that exists\ndue to being causally conditioned\n(pratyay\u0101dh\u012bnav\u1e5bttitv\u0101t), and (b) it is the basis\nof \u201cwhat appears\u201d (yat khy\u0101ti) mistakenly in our\ncognition as conventionally real, it is the basis for the\n\u201cunreal conceptual fabrication\u201d (asatkalpa) which is the\nphenomenological basis of the appearance of reified subjects and\nobjects ([TSN] 2 Sems tsam shi 10a). The implications of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101rin expression \u201cwhat appears\u201d to describe\nthe dependent nature are therefore twofold: (a) that the things that\nappear in our cognitions are exclusively the representations, which\nare the manifest forms of the subliminal impressions, and (b) that the\nentire web of conventional reality, which presents itself to our\ncognitions phenomenologically in various ways, is exclusively the\nappearance of those representations. Apart from those representations,\nconsciousnesses, which appear to be external objects, there is no\nconventionally real external content which corresponds to what\nappears.\n\nSecond, in contrast with the dependent nature which is the basis of\n\u201cwhat appears\u201d (yat khy\u0101ti), the imaginary nature\n(parikalpita), as Vasubandu defines it, is the mode of\nappearance \u201cas it appears\u201d (sau yath\u0101 khy\u0101ti) on\nthe ground that its existence is only an \u201cunreal conceptual\nfabrication\u201d (asatakalpo) ([TSN] 2, Sems tsam chi 10a).\nThe imaginary nature is only an \u201cunreal conceptual\nconstruction\u201d because of two reasons: (i) it is the dependent\nnature\u2014representations\u2014merely dually reified by the mind\nas an ultimately real subject, or self, or eg, and (ii) the imaginary\nnature is dualistic reification of beings and objects as existing\nreally and externally, there is no such reality.\n\nThird, given the fact that the dependent nature is devoid, or free\nfrom this duality, the imaginary nature is a mere superimposition on\nit. Hence nonduality, the perfect nature (parini\u1e63panna) is\nultimate reality of the dependent nature.\n3.2 Ultimate truth\n\nIn the Commentary on the S\u016btra of Intent\n(\u0100rya-sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra, Mdo sde\nca 1b\u201355b) it is stated that \u201cReality as it is, which is\nthe intentional object of a pure consciousness, is the definition of\nthe perfect nature. This must be so because it is with respect to this\nthat the Victorious Buddha attributed all phenomena as natureless,\nultimately.\u201d (Mdo sde ca 35b) Vasubandhu\u2019s [TSN]\ndefines \u201cthe perfect nature (parini\u1e63panna) as the\neternal nonexistence of \u2018as it appears\u2019 of \u2018what\nappears\u2019 because it is unalterable.\u201d ([TSN] 3, Sems\ntsam chi 10a) \u201cWhat appears\u201d is the dependent\nnature\u2014a series of cognitive events, the representations.\n\u201cAs it appears\u201d is the imaginary nature\u2014the unreal\nconceptual fabrication of the subject-object duality. The\nrepresentations, (i.e., the dependent nature) appear in the cognition\nas if they have in them the subject-object duality, even though the\ndependent nature is wholly devoid of such subject-object duality. The\nperfect nature is therefore this eternal nonexistence of the imaginary\nnature\u2014the duality\u2014in the dependent nature.\n\nVasubandhu defines the perfect nature as the ultimate truth and\nidentifies it with mere-consciousness. \u201cThis is the ultimate\n(param\u0101rtha) of the dharmas, and so it is the reality\n(tathat\u0101) too. Because its reality is like this all the time, it\nis mere consciousness.\u201d (Tri\u1e43 25, Sems\ntsam shi 3b) Accordingly Sthiramati\u2019s Commentary on the\nThirty Verses (Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\n[Tri\u1e43B], Sems tsam shi 146b\u2013171b), explains\n\u201cultimate\u201d (param\u0101rtha) here as referring to\n\u201c\u2019 world-transcending knowledge\u2019\n(lokottara-nirvikalpa-j\u00f1\u0101na) in that there is\nnothing that surpasses it. Since it is the object of [the transcendent\nknowledge], it is the ultimate. It is even like the space in having\nthe same taste everywhere. It is the perfect nature, which is\nstainless and unchangable. Therefore, it is known as the\n\u2018ultimate.\u2019\u201d ([Tri\u1e43B], Sems tsam shi\n169ab)\n\nSo, as we can see the dependent and the imaginary natures together\nexplain the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s conventional reality and the perfect\nnature explains its conception of the ultimate reality. The first two\nnatures provide an argument for the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s empirical and\npractical standpoints (vyavah\u0101ra), conventional truth and the\nthird nature an argument for its ultimate truth. Even then the\ndependent nature alone is conventionally real and the perfect nature\nalone is ultimately real. By contrast, the imaginary nature is unreal\nand false even by the empirical and practical standards. This is true\nin spite of the fact the imaginary nature is constitutive of the\nconventional truth.\n\nSo, the perfect nature\u2014nondual mind, i.e., emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) of the subject-object duality\u2014is the\nultimate reality of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra conception. Ultimate truth\ntakes various forms as it is understood within the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin\ntradition. As Maitreyan\u0101tha states, ultimate truth takes three\nprimary forms\u2014as emptiness it is the ultimate object, as\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a it is the ultimate attainment, and as nonconceptual\nknowledge it is the ultimate realization ([MVK], Sems tsam\nphi 42B).\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Arguments\n\nThe core argument in support of the only mind thesis is the\nimpossibility of the existence of external objects. Vasubandhu\ndevelops this argument in his Vi\u1e43 1\u201327 as does\nDign\u0101ga in his Examination of the Intentional Object\n(\u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101v\u1e5btti,\n\u0100PV 1\u20138, Tshad ma ce 86a\u201387b)\nagainst the atomists (Naiy\u0101yikas-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and\n \u0100bhidharmikas[8]).\n Against the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealist thesis the realist opponents,\nas Vasubandhu observes, raise three objections:\u2014\u201cIf\nconsciousness (does) not (arise) out from an object (i) neither the\ndetermination or certainty (niyama) in regard to place (de\u015ba) and\ntime (k\u0101la), (ii) nor the indetermination or unexclusiveness\n(aniyama) in regard to the series of (consciousness) (iii) nor the\nperformance of the (specific) function (k\u1e5btyakriya) are\nlogically possible (yukt\u0101)\u201d (Vi\u1e41 2, Sems\ntsam shi 3a).\n\nVasubandhu offers his Yog\u0101c\u0101ra reply in the\nVi\u1e43 to these realist objections and insists that the\nidealist position does not face these three problems. The first\nproblem is not an issue for the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra since dreams\n(svapna) account for the spatio-temporal determination. In dreams, in\nthe absence of an external object, one still has the cognition of a\nwoman, or a man in only determinate / specific time and place, and not\narbitrarily and not everywhere and not in any moment. Neither is the\nsecond problem of the lack of an intersubjective agreement an issue\nfor the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra. The case of the pretas (hungry-ghosts)\naccount for intersubjective agreement as they look at water they\nalone, not other beings, see rivers of pus, urine, excrement, and\ncollectively hallucinates demons as the hell guardians. Although pus,\nurine, excrement and hell guardians are nonexistent externally, due to\nthe maturation of their collective karma, pretas exclusively\nexperience the series of cognitions (vij\u00f1apti), other beings do\nnot encounter such experience (Vi\u1e43 3, Sems\ntsam shi). Nor is the lack of causal efficacy of the impressions\nor representations in the consciousness a problem for the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. As in the case of wet dreams, even without a union\nof the couple, the emission of semen can occur, and so the\nrepresentations in the consciousness are causally efficient even\nwithout the externally real object.\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s defensive arguments against the realist\nchallenges are quite strong. However unless Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is able\nto undermine the core realist thesis\u2014i.e., reality of the\nexternal objects\u2014and its key supporting argument\u2014the\nexistence of atoms\u2014then the debate could go either way.\nTherefore Yog\u0101c\u0101ra shows the nonexistence, or unreality of\nthe atoms as the basis of the external object to reject the realist\nposition.\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s impressions-only theory and the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory both explain our sensory\nexperience (the spatio-temporal determinacy, intersubjective\nagreement, and causal efficacy). They agree on what the observables\nare: mental entities, including mental images but also emotions such\nas desires. They also agree that karma plays vital role in explaining\nour experience. The realist theory, though, according to\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s Investigation About the Support of the\nCognition (\u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101v\u1e5b\ntti [\u0100lamPV]) has to posit the reality of additional\nphysical objects, things that are in principle unobservable, given\nthat all we experience in the cognition are our impressions\n([\u0100lamPV], Tshad ma ce 86a).\n\nIf the realist thesis were correct, then there would be three\nalternatives for the atoms to act as the intentional objects of\ncognition.\n\nAtoms of the things would be either one in the way the\nNyya-Vaieika conceives the whole as something constituted by\nparts but being single, one, different from the parts that\ncompose it, and having a real existence apart from the existence of\nthe parts. Or\nthings would have to be constituted by multiple atoms\ni.e., a number or a group of atoms coexisting one besides the other\nwithout forming a composite whole as a result of mutual\ncohesion between the atoms. Or\nthings would have to be atoms grouped together,\nmassed together as a unity among themselves with a tight cohesion.\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra contends that these are the only three alternatives\nin which the reality of the external objects can functioning as the\nobjects of cognition.\n\n\nOf the three alternatives: (1) points to the unity of a thing\nconceived as a whole; and (2) and (3) point to the\nmultiplicity looking at the things as loose atoms, i.e.,\ncomposite atoms. Not one of the three possibilities is, on\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s account, admissible as the object of cognition\nhowever. The first is inadmissible because nowhere an external object\nis grasped as a unity, whole, one apart\nfrom its parts ([\u0100lamPV] Tshad ma ce 86b). The second is\ninadmissible because when we see things we find that the atoms are not\nperceived individually as one by one ([Vi\u1e43] 13, Sems\ntsam shi 3b). The third alternative is also rejected because the\natoms in this case cannot be proved to exist as an indivisible\n([Vi\u1e43] 14, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nFurther, if there were a simultaneous conjunction of an atom with\nother six atoms coming from the six directions, the atom would have\nsix parts because that which is the locus of one atom cannot be the\nlocus of another atom. If the locus of one atom were the locus of the\nsix atoms, which were in conjunction with it, then since all the seven\natoms would have the same common locus, the whole mass constituted by\nthe seven atoms would be of the size of a single atom, because of the\nmutual exclusion of the occupants of a locus. Consequently, there\nwould be no visible mass (Vi\u1e4312, Sems tsam shi\n3b).\n\nSince unity is an essential characteristic of being the whole, or\ncomposite whereas indivisibility an essential characteristic of being\nan atom when both the unity and individuality of the atoms are\nrejected, then the whole and indivisible atoms are no longer\nadmissible. Therefore, Vasubandhu sums up the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nobjections against the reality of the external sense-objects\n(\u0101yatanas) as: \u201cAn external sense-object is unreal because\nit cannot be the intentional object of cognition either as (1) a\nsingle thing or (2) as a multiple in [isolated] atoms; or (3) as a\naggregate because the atom is not proven to exist\u201d\n(Vi\u1e4311, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nThe realist insists that the external sense objects are real and that\ntheir reality is ascertained by the various means of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47as) of which perception (pratyak\u1e63a) is the\nmost important. If the external sense objects are nonexistents, there\ncan be no intentional objects, then cognition would not arise. Since\ncognitions do arise, there must be external objects as their\nintentional objects.\n\nTo this objection, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra employs two arguments to refute\nthe realist claim and to establish the mechanism of cognition, which\ntakes place without the atoms of an external object. The first\nargument shows that atoms do not satisfy the criterion of being the\nintentional object, therefore they do not cause the perception.\n\u201cPerceptual cognition [takes place] just like in dreams and the\nlike [even without an external object]; moreover, when that\n[cognition] occurs, the external object is not seen; how can it be\nthought that this is a case of perception?\u201d\n(Vi\u1e4316, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nThe second is the time-lag argument, according to which, there is a\ntime-gap between the perceptual judgement we make and the actual\nperceptual process. When we make a perceptual judgement, at that time\nwe do not perceive the external object as it is in our mental\nconsciousness (manovij\u00f1\u0101na) that carries out the judgement\nand since the visual consciousness that perceives the object has\nalready ceased. Hence at the time when the mental consciousness\ndelivers it judgment, the perceptual cognition no longer exists since\nall things are momentary. Therefore the atoms of an external object is\nnot the intentional object of perceptual cognition, since it has\nalready ceased and does not now exist therefore it is not responsible\nfor the cognition\u2019s having the content it has, like the unseen events\noccurring on the other side of the wall (Vasubandhu\u2019s\nVi\u1e43\u015batik\u0101-k\u0101rik\u0101v\u1e5btti\n[Vi\u1e43KV] 16\u201317).\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra therefore concludes that we cannot postulate the\nreality of an external object through direct perception. However since\nin perceptual cognition we are directly aware of something, there must\nbe an intentional object of the perceptual cognition. That intentional\nobject of perceptual cognition is, according to the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, none other than the subliminal impressions\n(v\u0101san\u0101s) passing from their latent state contained in the\nstorehouse consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) to their\nconscious level. Therefore the impressions are the only things that\nare conventionally real.\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s [TSN] 35\u201336 inspired by the Buddhist traditional\nreligious beliefs also offers others arguments to defend the idealism\nof Yog\u0101c\u0101ra:\n\none and the same thing appears differently to beings that are in\ndifferent states of existence (pretas, men, and gods);\nthe ability of the bodhisattvas and\ndhy\u0101yins (practitioners of meditation) who have attained\nthe power of thinking (cetova\u015bit\u0101) to visualise\nobjects at will;\nthe capacity of the yogins who have attained serenity of\nmind (\u015bamatha) and a direct vision of dharmas as they\nreally are (dharma-vipa\u015byan\u0101) to perceive things at\nthe very moment of the concentration of mind\n(manasik\u0101ra) with their essential characteristics of\nflux, suffering, nonself, empty; and\nthe power of those who have attained intuitive knowledge\n(nirvikalpakaj\u00f1\u0101na) which enables them not to\nblock the perception of things.\n\n\nAll these arguments based on the facts of experience show that objects\ndo not exist really outside the mind, that they are products of mental\ncreation and that their appearance is entirely mind dependent.\nTherefore the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theory of the two truths concludes\nthat the whole world is a product of mind\u2014it is the collective\nmental actions (karma) of all beings. All living beings see the same\nworld because of the identical maturation of their karmic\nconsequences. Since the karmic histories of beings are same, there is\nhomogeneity in the way in which the world is experienced and\nperceived. This is the reason there is an orderly world instead of\nchaotic and arbitrariness. This is also the reason behind the\nimpressions of the objectivity of the world.\n4. Madhyamaka\n\nAfter the Buddha the philosopher who broke new ground on the theory of\nthe two truths in the Madhyamaka system is a South Indian monk,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca. 100 BCE\u2013100 CE). Amongst his seminal\nphilosophical works delineating the theory are\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\n\nFundamental Verses on the Middle Way\n(M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 [MMK],\nSeventy Verses on Emptiness\n(\u015aunyat\u0101saptati),\nRebutting the Disputes\n (Vigrahvy\u0101vartan\u012b[9]\n and\nSixty Verses on Logical Reasoning\n(Yukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dik\u0101).\n\n\n\u0100ryadeva\u2019s work\nCatu\u1e25\u015bataka\u1e63\u0101strak\u0101rik\u0101\n(Four Hundred Verses) is also considered as one of the\nfoundational texts delineating Madhyamaka\u2019s theory of the two\ntruths.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna saw himself as propagating the dharma taught by\nthe Buddha, which he says is precisely based on the theory of the two\ntruths: a truth of mundane conventions and a truth of the ultimate.\n([MMK] 24.8, Dbu ma tsa 14b\u201315a) He saw the theory of\nthe two truths as constituting the Buddha\u2019s core teaching and his\nphilosophy. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna maintains therefore that those who do\nnot understand the distinction between these two truths would fail to\nunderstand the Buddha\u2019s teaching ([MMK] 24.9, Dbu ma tsa\n15a). This is so, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, because (1) without relying\non the conventional truth, the meaning of the ultimate cannot be\nexplained, and (2) without understanding the meaning of the ultimate,\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a is not achieved ([MMK] 24.10, Dbu ma tsa\n15a).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of the two truths is fundamentally\ndifferent from all theories of truth in other Indian philosophies.\nHindu philosophers of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\nS\u0101\u1e43kya-Yoga, and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-Ved\u0101nta\u2014all advocate a\nfoundationalism of some kind according to which ultimate reality is\ntaken to be \u201csubstantive reality\u201d (drayva) or foundation\nupon which stands the entire edifice of the conventional ontological\nstructures where the ultimate reality is posited as immutable, fixed,\nirreducible and independent of any interpretative conventions. That is\nso, even though the conventional structure that stands upon it\nconstantly changes and transforms.\n\nAs we saw the Buddhist realism of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and the\nrepresentationalism of the Sautr\u0101ntika both advocate ultimate\ntruth as ultimately real, logically irreducible. The idealism of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra holds nondual mind as the only ultimate reality and\nthe external world as merely conventional truths. On\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka all things including ultimate truth\nare ultimately unreal, empty (\u015b\u016bnya) of any intrinsic nature\n(svabh\u0101va) including the emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\nitself, therefore all are groundless. In this sense a M\u0101dhyamika\n(a proponent of the Madhyamaka thought) is a an advocate of the\nemptiness (\u015b\u016bnyav\u0101din), advocate of the intrinsic\nunreality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vav\u0101din), groundlessness,\nessencelessness, or carelessness. Nevertheless to assert that all\nthings are empty of any intrinsic reality, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, is\nnot to undermine the existential status of things as simply\nnothing. On the contrary, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, to\nassert that the things are empty of any intrinsic reality is to\nexplain the way things really are as causally conditioned phenomena\n(prat\u012btyasamputpa\u1e45h\u0101).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s central argument to support his radical\nnon-foundationalist theory of the two truths draws upon an\nunderstanding of conventional truth as tied to dependently arisen\nphenomena, and ultimate truth as tied to emptiness of the intrinsic\nnature. Since the former and the latter are co-constitutive of each\nother, in that each entials the other, ultimate reality is tied to\nbeing that which is conventionally real. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna advances\nimportant arguments justifying the correlation between conventional\ntruth vis-\u00e0-vis dependent arising, and emptiness\nvis-\u00e0-vis ultimate truth. These arguments bring home their\nepistemological and ontological correlations ([MMK] 24.14; Dbu\nma tsa 15a). He argues that wherever applies emptiness as the\nultimate reality, there applies the causal efficacy of conventional\nreality and wherever emptiness does not apply as the ultimate reality,\nthere does not apply the causal efficacy of conventional reality\n(Vig.71) (Dbu ma tsa 29a). According to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, ultimate reality\u2019s being empty of any intrinsic\nreality affords conventional reality its causal efficacy since being\nultimately empty is identical to being causally produced,\nconventionally. This must be so since, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna,\n\u201cthere is no thing that is not dependently arisen; therefore,\nthere is no such thing that is not empty\u201d ([MMK] 24.19, Dbu\nma tsa 15a).\n\nSv\u0101tantrika / Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the two\ntruths\n\nThe theory of the two truths in the Madhyamaka in India took a great\nresurgence from the fifth century onwards soon after Buddhap\u0101lita\n(ca. 470\u2013540) wrote A Commentary on [N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s]\nFundamental Verses of the Middle Way\n\n(Buddhap\u0101litam\u016blamadhyamakav\u1e5btti,[10]Dbu\n ma tsa 158b\u2013281a). Set forth in this text is a\nthoroughgoing non-foundationalist philosophic reasoning and\nmethod\u2014pr\u0101sa\u1e45ga arguments or reductio ad\nabsurdum style without relying upon the svatantra,\nformal probative argument\u2014to elucidate the Madhyamaka\nmetaphysics and epistemology ingrained in theory of the two truths.\nFor this reason, Buddhap\u0101lita is often identified later as the\nfounder of the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka, although elucidation\nof the theory itself is set out in the works of Candrak\u012brti.\nThree decades later\n Bh\u0101vaviveka[11]\n (ca. 500\u2013570) challenged Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s interpretation of\nthe two truths, and developed a Madhyamaka account of the two truths\nthat reflects a significant ontological and epistemological shift from\nBuddhapalit\u0101\u2019s position, which was later defended in the works of\nCandrak\u012brti to whom we shall return shortly.\n\nMany later commentators ignore the philosophical contents of the\ndebate between the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the Sv\u0101tantrika and\nclaim that their controversy is confined only to pedagogical or\nmethodological issues. There is another view according to which the\ncontents of the debate between the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the\nSv\u0101tantrika\u2014Buddhap\u0101lita versus Bh\u0101vavevika\nfollowed by Bh\u0101vavevika versus Candrak\u012brti\u2014is\nessentially philosophic in nature. Underpinning the dialectical or\nmethodological controversy between the two Madhyamaka camps lies a\ndeeper ontological and epistemological divide implied within their\ntheories of the two truths, and this in turn is reflected in the\ndifferent methodological considerations they each deploy. So on this\nsecond view, the variation in the methods used by the two schools of\nthe Madhyamaka are not simple differences in their rhetorical devices\nor pedagogical tools, they are underlain by more serious philosophical\ndisagreements between the two.\n\nAccording to this view the philosophical differentiations between the\nSv\u0101tantrika and the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika is best contained\nwithin the discourse of the two truths. Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory\nof the two truths we leave aside for the time being. First we shall\ntake up the Sv\u0101tantrika\u2019s account.\n4.1 Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka wrote some of the major Madhyamaka treatises\nincluding\n\nLamp of Wisdom\n(Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpam\u016blamadhyamakav\u1e5btti\n[PPMV], Dbu ma tsha 45b\u2013259b),\nVerses on the Heart of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamakah\u1e5bdayak\u0101rik\u0101 [MadhHK],\nBlazes of Reasoning: A Commentary on Verses of the Heart of\nthe Middle Way (Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101).\n\n\nIn these texts Bh\u0101vavevika rejects the Brahmanical systems of\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-Ved\u0101nta on both metaphysical and\nepistemological grounds. All the theories of truth and knowledge\nadvanced in these systems from his Madhyamaka point of view are too\nrigid to be of any significant use. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s critiques of\n\u0100bhidharmikas\u2014Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra predominantly target the\nontological foundationalism which underpins their theories of the\nultimate truth. He rejects them on the ground that from an analytic\ncognitive perspective, which scrutinises the nature of reality,\nnothing\u2014subject and object\u2014is found to be ultimately real\nsince all things are rationally reduced to spatial parts or temporal\nmoments. Thus he proposes the view that both the subject and the\nobject are conventionally intrinsically real as both are\nconventional truths, where as both are ultimately\nintrinsically unreal as both are empty of ultimate reality, hence\nemptiness alone is the ultimate reality.\n\nAlthough Bh\u0101vavevika is said to have founded the Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka, it is important to note that there exists two different\nsubschools of the Sv\u0101tantrika tradition:\n\nSautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\n\nThe two schools of the Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka take\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s intepretation of the two truths, on the whole, to\nbe more cogent than the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s. Particularly both\nschools reject ultimate intrinsic reality while positing\nconventional intrinsic reality. As far as the presentation of\nultimate truth is concerned both schools are in\nagreement\u2014nonself or emptiness alone is the ultimate reality,\nand the rest\u2014the entire range of dharmas\u2014are ultimately\nempty of any intrinsic reality. Nevertheless, the two schools differ\nslightly on the matter related to the theory of conventional truth,\nspecifically concerning reality or unreality of the external or\nphysical objects on the conventional level. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nSv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka view held by Bh\u0101vavevika himself, and\nhis student J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, affirms intrinsic reality of the\nconventional truths of both the outer domains and the inner domains\nand mental faculty along with their six respective\nconsciousnesses.\n\nThe arguments that affirm the conventional reality of the external\nobjects are the same arguments that Bh\u0101vavevika employed to\ncriticise the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra arguments rejecting the reality of\nexternal objects. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s [MadhHK] 5.15 points out\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s arguments are contradicted by perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), tradition (\u0101gama) and commonse sense\n(lokaprasiddha), since they all prove the correctness of the cogniton\nof material form ([MadhHK] 5.15 Dbu ma dza 20b and\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 5.15 Dbu ma dza 204ab).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s dream argument is also rejected because,\naccording to Bh\u0101vavevika, dream-consciousness and so forth have\ndharmas as their objects (\u0101lambana / dmigs pa) ([MadhHK]\n5.19 Dbu ma dza 20b). And dharmas are based on intrinsically real\nconventional objects, because they are the repeated impression of the\nobjects that have been experienced previously, like memory\n(Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101 5.19 Dbu ma dza 205a).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka view held by\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and his student Kamala\u015b\u012bla\naffirms conventionally intrinsic reality of the inner domains and\nrejects the intrinsic reality of the outer domains and it claims the\nexternal objects are mere conceptual fictions.\n4.1.1 Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\nOf the two schools of Sv\u0101tantraka we shall first take up the\ntheory of the two truths presented in the Sautr\u0101ntika\nSv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s position represents\nthe theory of the two truths held by this school which was later\npromoted by his disciple J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha. The cornerstones of\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka theory of the two\ntruths are the following theses:\n\nThat at the level of conventional truth all phenomena are\nintrinsically real (svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), because they are\nestablished as intrinsic realities from the perspective of the\nnon-analytical cognitions of the na\u00efve ordinary beings. Allied to\nthis thesis is Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s claim that the Madhyamaka accepts,\nconventionally, the intrinsic reality of things, for it is the\nintrinsic reality that defines what is to be conventionally real.\nThat at the level of ultimate truth, all phenomena, with the\nexception of the emptiness which is ultimately real, are intrinsically\nunreal (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), or ultimately unreal,\nbecause they are established as empty of any intrinsic reality from\nthe perspective of analytical exalted cognition (i.e., ultimate\ncognition of \u0101rya-beings). Allied to this thesis is\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s claim that Madhyamaka rejects intrinsic reality at\nthe ultimate level since ultimate reality constitutes that which is\nintrinsically unreal, therefore empty.\n\nConventional truth\n\nWe shall consider Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\u2019s\ndefence of the two claims in turn. We will begin first with\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s definition of the conventional truth. In the\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101, he defines conventional truths as an\n\u201cincontrovertible (phyin ci ma log pa) linguistic\nconvention.\u201d (Dbu ma dza 56a) Such conventional truth\non Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s Sv\u0101tantrika takes two forms\u2014unique\nparticulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / rang mtshan) and universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / spyi mtshan) as the\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 III.8, explains:\n\nPhenomena have dual characteristics (lak\u1e63ana / mtshan nyid),\ndifferentiated as being universal or unique. Unique particular\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / rang mtshan) is a thing\u2019s intrinsic reality\n(svabh\u0101vat\u0101 / rang gi ngo bo), the domain of engagement\nwhich is definitively ascertained by a non-conceptual cognition\n(nirvikalpena j\u00f1\u0101nena / rnam par rtog pa med pa\u2019i shes\npa). Universal (s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is a\ncognitive domain to be apprehended by an inferential cognition\n(anumanavij\u00f1\u0101nena / rjes su dpog pa\u2019i shes pa) which is\nconceptual (Dbu ma dza 55b).\n\nIn this passage Bh\u0101vavevika essentially summarises some of the\nkey features of conventional truths which are also critical to\nunderstanding the differences between the Sv\u0101tantrika and\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika accepts, based on this passage, unique particular\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) as an integral part of the ontological\nstructure of the conventional truth. The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika, by\ncontrast, rejects the concept of unique particular even at the level\nof conventional truth.\nBh\u0101vavevika ascribes unique particular an ontological\nqualification of being \u201cintrinsically real\u201d\n(svabh\u0101vat\u0101), or \u201cinherently real\u201d as its given\nstatus, explicitly affirming a form of foundationalism of unique\nparticulars at the level of conventional truth, which the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika totally rejects.\nBh\u0101vavevika endorses the Pram\u0101\u1e47ika\u2019s epistemology\nin which unique particular, which is intrinsically real,\nconventionally, is considered as the domain of engagement ascertained\nby a non-conceptual cognition. The universal\n(s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is considered as the\ndomain to be apprehended by a conceptual inferential cognition.\n\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s defence of the thesis that conventionally things\nare intrinsically real can be summed up in two arguments. First, as\nfar as things are conventional realities they are also intrinsic or\ninherent realities, for being intrinsically real is the reason why\nthings are designated as \u201cconventional reality,\u201d since\nfrom a conventional standpoint\u2014i.e., non-analytical cognitive\nengagements of the ordinary beings\u2014things do appear to be\ninherently real. This means that being \u201cintrinsic\u201d is, for\nBh\u0101vavevika, what makes conventional reality a\nreality.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s second argument states that as long as a\nM\u0101dhyamika accepts conventional reality it must also accept\nthings as intrinsic in order to avoid the nihilism charge, for\nconventional reality is defined in terms of its being intrinsically\nand uniquely real (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). Denying intrinsic reality\nof things at the conventional level, would therefore entail the denial\nof their conventional existence, since it would entail the denial of\nthe defining characteristics of the conventional reality. This follows\nsays Bh\u0101vavevika because \u201cThe Lord (bh\u0101gvan / bcom\nldan ldas) has taught the two truths. Based on this [explanatory\nschema] conventionally things are posited in terms of their intrinsic\nnatures and [unique] particulars ([sva]lak\u1e63a\u1e47a / mtshan\nnyid). It is only ultimately that [things are] posited as having no\nintrinsic reality\u201d ((Dbu ma dza 60a).\nUltimate truth\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s second thesis is that at the level of ultimate\ntruth, all phenomena are intrinsically unreal\n(ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), therefore Madhyamaka rejects\nintrinsic reality ultimately. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 3.26 offers three ways to interpret the\ncompound param\u0101rtha \u201cultimate domain\u201d or\n\u201cultimate object\u201d literally. In the first, both the terms\n\u201cultimate\u201d (param) and \u201cdomain\u201d (artha) stands\nfor the object\u2014emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\u2014because\nit is both the \u201cultimate\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d as well\nas an \u201cobject to be known,\u201d \u201canalysed\u201d\n(par\u012bk\u1e63a\u1e47\u012bya / brtag par bya ba) and\n\u201cunderstood\u201d (pratip\u0101dya / go bar bya ba). In the\nsecond compound, param\u0101rtha stands for \u201cobject of the\nultimate\u201d (paramasya artha / dam pa\u2019i don) where\n\u201cobject\u201d refers to emptiness and \u201cultimate\u201d\nrefers to a non-conceptual exalted cognition\n(nirvikalpaj\u00f1\u0101na / rnam par mi rtog pa\u2019i ye shes) of the\nmeditative equipoise (sam\u0101hita / mnyam bzhag). In the third\ncompound param\u0101rth stands for a concordant ultimate (rjes su\nmthun pa\u2019i shes rab), a cognition that accords with the knowledge of\nthe ultimate since it has the ultimate as its domain.\n\nThe first two etymological senses of the term param\u0101rthas have in\nthem the sense of emptiness as an objective domain since it is both\nthe final ontic status of things and it is the ultimate object of a\nnon-conceptual exalted cognition. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s third\netymological sense of the term param\u0101rtha has it identified with\ncognition that accords with the knowledge of the ultimate truth on the\nground that such cognition has emptiness as its object and such\nknowledge is a means through which one develops a non-conceptual\nknowledge of ultimate reality. This third sense of param\u0101rtha\nallows Bh\u0101vavevika to argue that a cognition of the subsequent\nattainment (p\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dhalabdhaj\u00f1\u0101na / rjes\nthob ye shes) which directly follows from the non-conceptual\nmeditative equipoise, while it is conceptual in character, is\nnevertheless a concordant ultimate ([PPMV] Dbu ma tsa\n228a).\n\nSo for Bh\u0101vavevika then, \u201cthe ultimate is of two kinds: one\nis transcendent (lokuttara / \u2018jig rten las \u2018das pa),\nundefiled (zag pa med pa), free from elaboration (aprapa\u00f1ca /\nspros med) which needs to be engaged without a deliberative effort.\nThe second one\u201d as he explains in Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101\n3.26 \u201cis elaborative (pr\u0101pa\u00f1ca / spros pa), hence it\ncan be engaged with a deliberative effort by means of a correct\nmundane cognitive process (dag pa\u2019i \u2018jig rten pa\u2019i ye shes) that\nis sustained by the collective force of virtues (bsod nams) and\ninsights (ye shes)\u201d (Dbu ma dza 60b).\n\nBh\u0101vavevika advances several arguments to defend the thesis that\nultimately all are intrinsically unreal. The first is the\nconditionality argument pertaining to the four elements, according to\nwhich, all the four elements are ultimately empty of any intrinsic\nreality, for they all are conditioned by the causal factors\nappropriated for their becoming and their existence.\n\nThe second is Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s non-foundationalist ontological\nargument which demonstrates all phenomena, including the atoms, are\nultimately non-foundational, for ultimately there is nothing that can\nbe taken as the foundational entity (dravya) or intrinsically real\nsince the ultimate analysis reveals that all phenomena are composed of\nthe atomic particles that are themselves composites.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s third non-foundationalist epistemological argument\nshows that ultimately the objects are not the domain of cognitions.\nThe argument says that \u201cA visible form is not ultimately\napprehended by the visual faculty because it is a composite (bsags)\nlike a sound and because it is a product of the elements like the\nsound.\u201d ([MadhHK] 3.33 Dbu ma dza 5a) The reasons\nprovided to justify the thesis are twofold: (i) being composite and\n(ii) being a product of the elements. Given that being\ncomposites and products equally apply to visible\nform and sound, these two reasons cannot warrant the validity of the\nargument justifying the thesis that a visible form is ultimately\napprehended by the visual faculty. If they did, they would equally\nwarrant the validity of the argument justifying the thesis that a\nsound is ultimately apprehended by the visual faculty (Dbu ma\ndza 65ab).\n\nIn conclusion: mirroring these two critically important philosophical\npositions Bh\u0101vavevika introduces a type of method or pedagogical\ndevice that is unique to the Sv\u0101tantrika contra to his\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika counterpart.\n4.1.2 Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\nIn the early eighth century Bh\u0101vavevika and\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s theory of the two truths was adopted and\nelucidated in the works of the latter\u2019s\n student[12]\n \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (705\u2013762) and his student\nKamala\u015b\u012bla (ca. 725\u2013788). \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nwrote:\n\nVerses on the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rak\u0101rik\u0101 [MAK], Dbu\nma sa 53a\u201356b),\nCommentary on the Verses of the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rav\u1e5btti,  [MAV], Dbu\nma sa 56b\u201384a).\n\n\nIn these works he argues for the synthesis of Madhyamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theories of the two truths which resulted in the\nformation of the Yogac\u0101r\u0101-Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka\u2014a subschool within the Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka.\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, who is a student of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, held the same conception of the two\ntruths in his works:\n\nSubcommentary on the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rapa\u00f1jik\u0101, Dbu ma\nsa 84a\u2013133b),\nLight of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101loka\u1e25 [MA], Dbu ma sa\n133b\u2013244a),\nDiscussion on the Light of Reality\n(Tattv\u0101loka-nama-prakara\u1e47a, Dbu ma sa\n244b\u2013273a),\nEstablishing the Non-intrinsic Reality of All Phenomena\n(Sarvadharm\u0101svabh\u0101vasiddhi, Dbu ma sa\n273a\u2013291a),\nStages of Meditation (Bh\u0101van\u0101krama,\nDbu ma ki 22a\u201368b).\n\n\nUnlike J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha and Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s realistic\nSautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka which presents\nconventional truth in agreement with the epistemological realism of\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika and ultimate truth in agreement with\nnon-foundationalist ontology of the Madhyamaka,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla advocate the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka. They each maintain a\nbasic presentation of conventional truth in agreement with the\nepistemological idealism of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and the presentation of\nultimate truth in agreement with the ontological non-foundationalism\nof the Madhyamaka. Therefore \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita concludes:\n\u201cBy relying on the Mind Only (cittamatra / sems tsam) one\nunderstands that external phenomena do not exist. And by relying on\nthis [i.e., Madhyamaka] one understands that even [the mind] is\nthoroughly nonself.\u201d ([MAK] 23 Dbu ma sa 56a) \u201cTherefore,\none attains a Mah\u0101y\u0101na [path] when one is able to ride the\nchariots of the two systems by holding to the reigns of logic.\u201d\n([MAK] 24 Dbu ma sa 56a) By \u201cthe two systems\u201d\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita meant, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s account of\nthe conventional truth with Madhyamaka\u2019s account of the ultimate\n truth.[13]\n\nUnderlying this syncretistic view of the two truths lay two\nfundamental theses that Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nare committed\u2014namely:\n\nthat there is no real external object, mind is the only thing that\nis conventionally real, hence Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is right about its\npresentation of the conventional truth; and\nthat even mind is unreal and empty of any intrinsic nature under\nultimate analysis, therefore nothing is ultimately real, hence\nMadhyamaka is right about its presentation of the ultimate truth.\n\n\nAnd it is precisely the synthesis of these two theses that defines the\ncharacteristic of the theory of the two truths in the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka.\n\u015a\u0101ntara\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla attempt to\nachieve this distinctive syncretistic characteristic in their works to\nwhich we turn our discussion.\nUltimate truth\n\nWe will follow \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\nand first take up the second major thesis\u2014ultimately everything,\nincluding the mind, is unreal and empty. Therefore, ultimate truth is\nthe emptiness of any intrinsic reality. According to\nKamala\u015b\u012bla ultimate truth has three senses: ([MA], Dbu\nma sa 233b)\n\nreality, the nature of which is characterised as \u201cnonself of\nperson\u201d and \u201cnonself of phenomena,\u201d is etymologically\nboth ultimate (param / dam pa) and object (artha / don).\ntranscendent knowledge (lokottara\u1e41\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e43), reliable cognition of the ultimate since it\nis directly engaged with ultimate reality.\nmundane knowledge, while not in itself ultimate knowledge, but\nbecause it is a complementary means of transcendent knowledge, it is\nalso identified as the ultimate.\n\n\nBoth \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla maintains\nthat the emptiness of intrinsic reality is the ultimate truth, and in\norder to demonstrate that this is so, Kamala\u015b\u012bla deploys\nfive forms of arguments\u2014namely:\n\nThe diamond-sliver argument (vajraka\u1e45\u0101diyukti / irdo\nrje gzegs ma\u2019i gtan tshigs) which shows that all things are empty of\nintrinsic reality because things are analytically not found to\narise\u2014neither from themselves, nor from another nor both nor\ncauselessly ([MA], Dbu ma sa 190a\u2013202b).\nThe argument refuting the arising of existent and non-existent\nentities (sadasadutp\u0101daprati\u1e63edhahetu / yod med skye\n\u2018gog gi gtan tshigs) which shows that all things are empty\nof intrinsic reality because their intrinsic reality is not found to\narise either from things that exist or from things that do not exist\n([MA], Dbu ma sa 202b).\nThe arguments refuting the four modes of arising\n(catu\u1e63ko\u1e6diyutp\u0101daprati\u1e63edhahetu / mu bzhi\nskye \u2018gog gi gtan tshigs) which shows that things are empty\nof intrinsic reality for the reason that such reality is neither found\nanaytically in existence (or being) nor in nonexistence (or nonbeing)\nnor both existence-nonexistence (being-nonbeing) nor neither existence\nnor nonexistence (neither being nor nonbeing) ([MA], Dbu ma\nsa 210b).\nThe neither-one-nor many argument (ek\u0101nekaviyogahetu /\ngcig du bral gyi gtan tshigs) which shows all phenomena are empty\nof intrinsic reality because they all lack the characteristics of\nbeing intrinsically one or intrinsically many ([MA], Dbu ma\nsa 218b).\nThe argument from dependent arising\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101dahetu / rten \u2018brel gyi gtan\ntshigs) which shows that things are produced from the association\nof multiple causes and condition, and therefore showing that things do\nnot have any intrinsic reality of their own ([MA], Dbu ma sa\n205b).\n\n\nThe most well-known of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u015bita\u2019s arguments is the\nneither-one-nor many\n argument,[14]\n which seeks to examine the final (or ultimate) identity (ngo bo\nla dpyod pa) of all phenomena. In his [MAK] and [MAV]\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita develops this argument in a great detail.\nThe essential feature of the argument is as follows: \u201cThe\nentities that are proclaimed by our own [Buddhist] schools and the\nother [non-Buddhist] schools, lack intrinsic identity because in\nreality their identity is neither a (1) singular nor a (2)\nplural\u2014like a reflection.\u201d ([MAK] 1, Dbu ma sa\n53a) In this argument:\n\nThe subject (rtsod gzhi cos can): the entities that are\nproclaimed by our own Buddhist schools and the other non-Buddhist\nschools (from here on \u2018all entities.)\nThe property to be proved (s\u0101dhyadharma / sgrub\nbya\u2019i chos) : the lack of intrinsic identity.\nWhat is being proved (s\u0101dhya / sgrub bya) :\nall entities lack the intrinsic identity.\nThe reason (hetu / rtags) or means of proof (s\u0101dhana\n/ sgrub byed) : in reality their identity is neither a\nsingular nor a plural.\nExample: like a reflection.\n\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the validity of the\nneither-one-nor many argument depends on whether or not it satisfies\nthe triple criteria (trir\u016bpali\u1e45ga / tshul gsum) of\nformal probative reasoning. The first criterion\n(pak\u1e63adharmat\u0101 / phyogs chos) shows that the\nreason qualifies the subject (phyogs / pak\u1e63a or chos can /\ndharmin), i.e., that the subject must be proven to have the\nproperty of the reason. That is, all entities must be shown, in\nreality, as neither singular nor plural. And therefore this argument\nconsists of two premises:\n\nthe premise that shows the lack of singularity\n(\u201cunity\u201d) and\nthe premise that shows the lack of plurality (or\n\u201cmany-ness\u201d)\n\n\nIn [MAK] and [MAV] \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita develops the argument\nshowing the lack of singularity in two parts: (i) the argument that\nshows the lack of the non-pervasive singularity in (a)\npermanent phenomena, and (b) in impermanent entities; and (ii) the\nargument that shows the lack of pervasive singularity by (a)\nrefuting the indivisible atomic particles which are said to have\ncomposed the objects, and (b) by refuting the unified consciousness\nposited by Yog\u0101c\u0101ra.\n\nThe premise that shows the lack of plurality is based upon the\nconclusion of the argument that shows the lack of singularity. This is\nso, argues \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, because \u201cWhen we\nanalyse any entity, none is [found] to be a singular. For that for\nwhich nothing is singular, there must also be nothing which is\nplural\u201d ([MAK] 61, Dbu ma sa 55a). This argument of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds from understanding that being\nsingular and being plural (manifold) are essentially\ninterdependent\u2014if there are no singular entity, one must accept\nthat there are no plural entity either since the latter is the former\nassembled.\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the argument from\nneither-one-nor many satisfies the triple criteria of valid reasoning.\nIt satisfies the first criterion because all instances of the subject,\nnamely the intrinsic identities of those entities asserted by the\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist opponents, are instances of entities which\nare neither singular nor plural. The second criterion of a valid\nreason\u2014the proof of the forward entailment\n(anvayavy\u0101pti / rjes khyab), i.e., the proof that the\nreason occurs in only \u201csimilar instances\u201d\n(sapak\u1e63a / mthun phyogs) where all instances of the\nreason are the instances of the predicates\u2014is also satisfied\nbecause the reason\u2014all phenomena are neither singular nor\nplural\u2014is an instance of the predicate\u2014phenomena which\nlack identity. The third criterion of a valid reason\u2014the proof\nof the counter entailment (vyatirekavy\u0101pti / ldog khyab /\nldog khyab), or the proof that the reason is completely absent\nfrom the dissimilar instances of the predicate (vipak\u1e63a / mi\nmthun phyogs)\u2014hold because there are no instances of the\npredicate which are not instances of the reason.\n\nThere are no instances of phenomena, which lacked intrinsic identity,\nwhich are not also instances of phenomena, that are neither singular\nnor plural. Therefore \u201cthe counter entailment holds since there\nare no entities that could be posited as existing in other possible\nalternatives\u201d ([MAV] 62 Dbu ma sa 69b).\n\nThus the second and the third criteria which are mutually entailing\nprove the entailment of the neither one-nor many argument. Once the\n entailment[15]\n of the argument is accomplished, in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nview, all potential loopholes in this argument are addressed. And\ntherefore the argument successfully proves that all phenomena are\nempty of any intrinsic reality, since they all lack any singular or\nplural identity.\n\nIt is clear, then, that the arguments of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Kamala\u015b\u012bla have the final thrust of demonstrating the\nreasons why all phenomena ultimately lack any intrinsic\nreality, and are therefore geared towards proving the emptiness of\nintrinsic reality as the ultimate truth, in each argument a specific\ndomain of analysis is used to prove the final ontological\nposition.\nConventional Truth\n\nLet us now turn to the first thesis and look at the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Sv\u0101tantratika Madhyamaka defence of the theory\nof conventional truth. As we have seen from the arguments such as\nneither-one-nor many, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla draw the conclusion that entities are ultimately\nempty of reality, for ultimately they do not exist either as a\nsingular or as a plural. They then move on to explain the way things\ndo exist, and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does this with an explicit\nadmission that things do exist conventionally\u2014\u201cTherefore\nthese entities are only conventionally defined. If [someone] accepts\nthem as ultimate, what can I do for that?\u201d ([MAK] 63 Dbu\nma sa 55a). Why is it that all entities are defined as only\nconventionally real? To understand the answer to this question, we\nneed to look at \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s definition of\nconventional reality, which consists of three criteria:\n\nit strictly appeals to its face-value and cannot be subjected to\nreasoned analysis (avic\u0101ra\u1e41a\u1e47\u012bya);\nit is causally efficient; and\nit is subjected to arising and disintegration ([MAK] 64, Dbu\nma sa 55a).\n\n\nElsewhere in [MAV] \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita also provides a\nbroader definition of conventionality (sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti / kun\nrdzob), and argues that conventionality is not simply a linguistic\nconvention (\u015babda-vyvah\u0101ra / sgra\u2019i tha snyad), it also\nincludes what is conventionally real, those that are seen and accepted\nby the M\u0101dhaymikas as dependently coarisen\n(prat\u012btyasamutpanna / rten cing \u2018brel \u2018byung), and\nthose which cannot be rationally analysed ([MAV] 65, Dbu ma\nsa 70a).\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s definition of conventional truth stresses\nepistemic error (br\u0101nta j\u00f1\u0101na / rnam shes khrul ba)\nin as much as he does stress on non-erroneous epistemic perspective\n(abr\u0101nta j\u00f1\u0101na / rnam shes ma khrul ba) in his\ndefinition of the ultimate truth. So on his definition, the nature of\nall entities, illusory persons and the like, is classified into two\ntruths by virtue of erroneous (br\u0101nta / khrula ba) and\nnon-erroneous cognition through which they are each represented.\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s definition of conventional truth makes\nexplicitly clear the synthesis between Madhayamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. The Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nclaims that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is right about the presentation of\nthe conventional truth as mere mental impressions, and that this can\nbe seen from the way in which \u015a\u0101ntara\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla defend this synthesis textually and rationally\nthrough relying heavily on the\ns\u016btras\u2014Sa\u1e43dhinirmocannas\u016btra,\nLa\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra,\nSaddharmapu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bkas\u016btra and so\nforth\u2014traditionally supporting Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism. The\nclaim is made here, and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does this\nexplicity, that the Madhyamaka and the idealistic doctrines taught in\nthese scriptures are all \u201cconsistent.\u201d ([MAV] 91 Dbu\nma sa 79a) The works of these two philosophers produce abundant\ncitations from these s\u016btra literatures stressing the\nsignificance of the passages like this from the\nLa\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra: \u201cMaterial forms\ndo not exist, one\u2019s mind appears to be external.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the argument, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues\n\u201cthat which is cause and effect is mere consciousness only. And\nwhatever is causally established abides in consciousness.\u201d\n([MAK] 91, Dbu ma sa 56a) Therefore phenomena that appear to\nbe real external objects like a blue-patch are not something that is\ndistinct from the nature of the phenomenological experience of\nblue-patch, even so, as the material form experienced in dreams is not\ndistinct from the dreaming experience ([MAV] 91 Dbu ma sa\n79a).\n\nBriefly, then, it is clear the two Sv\u0101tantriak\nschools\u2014Sautr\u0101ntika-Sv\u0101tantrika-Madhyamak and the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\u2014both uphold the\nstandard Madhyamaka position in terms of treating emptiness as the\nultimate truth, although, they vary somewhat in their presentation of\nconventional truth since the former is realistic and the latter\nidealistic about the nature of the conventional truth.\n4.2 Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka theory of the two\ntruths soon came under attack from Candrak\u012brti (ca.\n600\u2013650) who, among other works, wrote the following:\n\nClear-word Commentary on the Fundamental Verses of the Middle\nWay (M\u016blamadhyamakav\u1e5bttiprasannapad\u0101\n[PP], known simply as Prasannapad\u0101, Dbu ma\n\u2018a 1b\u2013200a),\nAn Introduction on Madhyamaka\n(Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra [M], Dbu ma \u2018a\n201b\u2013219a),\nCommentary on Introduction on Madhyamaka\n(Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101rabh\u0101\u015bya [MBh], Dbu\nma \u2018a 220b\u2013348a),\nCommentary on Four Hundred Verses\n(Catu\u00fa\u1e63ataka\u1e6dika, Dbu ma ya\n30b\u2013239a),\nCommentary on Seventy Verses on Emptiness\n(\u015a\u016bnayat\u0101saptativ\u1e5btti, Dbu ma\ntsa 110a\u2013121a),\nCommentary on Sixty Verses on Reasoning\n(Yukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dhikav\u1e5btii, Dbu ma\nya 1b\u201330b), and\nDiscussion on the Five Aggregates\n(Pa\u00f1caskandhaprakara\u1e47a, Dbu ma ya\n239b\u2013266b)\n\n\nIn these philosophical works, Candrak\u012brti rejects the theories of\nthe two truths in both Brahmanical and the Buddhist schools of\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Sautr\u0101ntika, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and\nSv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka. His chief reason for doing this is his\ndeep mistrust of the varying degrees of metaphysical and\nepistemological foundationalism that these theories are committed to.\nFor example Candrak\u012brti rejects Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s reading of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of the two truths and explicitly\nvindicates Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika approach to\nunderstanding N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka. He does this by\ndemonstrating the groundlessness of the fallacies Bh\u0101vavevika\nattributed to Buddhap\u0101lita, and thereby rejecting\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s admission and imposition upon N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nnon-foundationalist ontology of a kind of independent formal\nsv\u0101tantra argument, which Candrak\u012brti saw as one encumbered\nby foundationalist metaphysics, and is incompatible with\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s ontology. Instead of relying on the two truths\ntheories of other schools, Candrak\u012brti proposes a distinctive\nnon-foundationalist theory of the two truths in the Madhyamaka, and he\ndefends it against his foundationalist opponents. This school later\ncame to be known as the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka.\n\nAt the core of the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of the two truths\nare these two fundamental theses:\n\nOnly what is conventionally non-intrinsic is causally\neffective, for only those phenomena, the conventional nature of which\nis non-intrinsically real, are subject to conditioned or dependent\narising. Conventional reality (or dependently arisen phenomenon),\ngiven it is causally effective, is therefore always\nintrinsically unreal. Hence that which is conventionally (or\ndependently) coarisen is always conventionally (or dependently)\narisen.\nOnly what is ultimately non-intrinsic is causally\neffective, for only those phenomena, the ultimate nature of which is\nnon-intrinsically real, are subject to conditioned arising. Ultimate\ntruth (or emptiness), given it is causally effective, is therefore\nintrinsically unreal. Hence ultimate truth is ultimately unreal (or\nemptiness is always empty).\n\n\nAlthough these two theses are advanced separately, they are mutually\ncoextensive. There is a compatible relationship between conventional\ntruth and ultimate truth, hence between dependent arising\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da / rten \u2018brel) and emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 / stong pa nyid), and there is no tension\nbetween the two. We shall examine the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika arguments\nin defence of these theses.\n4.2.1 Conventional Truth\n\nLet us turn to the first thesis. Earlier we saw that both the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and Sautr\u0101ntika argue that only\nultimately intrinsic reality (svabh\u0101va) enables things\nto perform a causal function (arthakriya). The Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka rejects this, and it instead argues that things are\ncausally efficient because of their conventionally intrinsic\nreality (svabh\u0101va) or unique particularity\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka,\nhowever, rejects both these positions, and argues only what is\nconventionally non-intrinsic reality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va)\nis causally effective, for only those phenomena, the conventional\nnature of which is non-intrinsic, are subject to conditioned or\ndependent arising. Conventional reality (here treated as dependently\narisen phenomenon), given it is causally effective, is therefore\nalways intrinsically unreal, and hence lacks any intrinsic\nreality even conventionally. Hence that which is conventionally (or\ndependently) coarisen is always conventionally (or dependently) arisen\nand strictly does not arise ultimately.\n\nIn his etymological analysis of the term \u201cconvention\u201d\n(sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti / kun rdzob) in [PP] Candrak\u012brti attributes\nthree senses to the term convention:\n\nconfusion (avidy\u0101 / mi shes pa) for it obstructs the mundane\ncognitive processes of the ordinary beings from seeing the reality as\nit is by way of concealing (sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti / kun\nrdzob) its nature;\ncodependent (paraparasa\u1e43bhavana / phan tshun brtan\npa) for it is an interdependent phenomenon; and\nSignifier (sa\u1e41ket / rda) or worldly convention\n(lokavyavah\u0101ra / \u2018jig rten tha snyad) in the sense of\ndependently designated by means of expression and expressed,\nconsciousness and object of consciousness, etc ([PP] 24.8 Dbu\nma \u2018a 163a).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s claims that in the case of mundane cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings, the first sense of convention\neclipses the force of the second and the third senses. As a result,\nfar from understanding things as dependently arisen (the second sense)\nand dependently designated (the third sense), ordinary beings reify\nthem to be non-dependently arisen, and non-designated. Due to the\nforce of this cognitive confusion, from the perspective of mundane\ncognitive processes of the ordinary beings, things appear real, and\neach phenomenon appears intrinsically real in spite of their\nnon-intrinsic nature. Consequently this confusion, according to\nCandrak\u012brti, defines epistemic practices of the ordinary beings.\nFor this reason, the epistemic norms or the standard set by\nmundane convention of the ordinary beings, is poles apart\nfrom the epistemic norms set by mundane convention of the noble beings\n(\u0101ryas / \u2018phags pa) whose mundane cognitive processes are\nnot under the sway of afflictive confusion.\n\nIn order to illustrate this distinction, in his commentary [MBh] 6.28\nCandrak\u012brti introduces the concept: mere convention (kun\nrdzob tsam) of the noble beings to contrast with conventionally\nreal or conventional true (kun rdzob bden pa) of the\nordinary beings. Ordinary beings erroneously grasp all conditioned\nphenomena as intrinsically real, therefore things are\nconventionally real and thus are categories of conventional\ntruth. For noble beings, however, because they no longer reify them as\nreal, things are perceived as having the nature of being\ncreated (bcos ma) and unreal (bden pa ma yin pa)\nlike the reflected image ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n255a).\n\nAccording to Candrak\u0131rti\u2019s definition of the two truths, all\nthings embody dual nature, for each is constituted by its conventional\nnature and its ultimate nature. Consequently, all entities, according\nto this definition, satisfy the criterion of the two truths, for the\ndefinition of the two truths is one based on the two natures. The two\ntruths are, therefore, not merely one specific nature\nmirrored in two different perspectives ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 253a). Conventional nature entails conventional truth and\nultimate nature entails ultimate truth, and given each entity is\nconstituted by the two natures, the two truths define what each entity\nis in its ontological and epistemological terms.\n\nConventional nature is defined as conventional truth because it is the\ndomain of mundane cognitive process, and is readily accessible for\nordinary beings, including mundane cognitive process of noble beings.\nIt is a sort of truth, while unreal and illusory in\nreality, it is yet erroneously and non-analytically taken for granted\nby mundane cognitive processes of the ordinary beings. Ultimate\nnature, on the other hand, is defined as ultimate truth because it is\ndomain of the exalted cognitive process which engages with its object\nanalytically, one that is directly accessible for noble beings\n(\u0101ryas) and only inferentially accessible for ordinary beings. It\nis this sort of truth, both real and non-illusory, that is\ncorrectly and directly found out by exalted cognitive processes of\nnoble beings, and by analytic cognitive processes of ordinary\nbeings.\n\nMundane cognitive process that is associated with the definition of\nconventional truth and therefore allied to the perception of\nunreal entities is of two kinds ([M] 6.24 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 205a):\n\ncorrect cognitive process, and\nfallacious cognitive process.\n\n\nCorrect cognitive process is associated with an acute sense faculty,\nwhich is not impaired by any occasional extraneous causes of\nmisperception (see below). Fallacious cognitive process is associated\nwith a defective sense faculty impaired by occasional extraneous\ncauses of misperception. In [PP] Candrak\u012brti introduces us to a\nsimilar epistemic distinction:\n\nmundane convention (lokasa\u1e43v\u1e5bti /\n\u2018jig rten gyi kun rdzob) and\nnon-mundane convention (alokasa\u1e43v\u1e5bti /\u2018jig\nrten ma yin pa\u2019i kun rdzo).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s key argument behind to support the distinction\nbetween two mundane epistemic practices\u2014one mundane\nconvention and the other non-mundane convention\u2014is that\nthe former is, for mundane standard, epistemically reliable whereas\nthe latter is epistemically unreliable. Consequently correct cognitive\nprocesses of both ordinary and awakened beings satisfy the epistemic\nstandard of mundane convention, being non-deceptive by\nmundane standard, thus they set the standard of mundane convention;\nwhereas fallacious cognitive processes of defective sense faculties,\nof both ordinary and awakened beings, do not satisfy the epistemic\nstandard of mundane convention, and therefore, they are\ndeceptive even by mundane standard. They are thus\n\u201cnon-mundane convention\u201d as Candrak\u012brti characterises\nthem in [PP] 24.8 (Dbu ma \u2018a 163ab).\n\nJust as they are two kinds of sensory faculty\u2014nonerroneous and\nerroneous\u2014their objects are, according to Candrak\u012brti, of\ntwo corresponding kinds:\n\nconventionally real and\nconventionally unreal.\n\n\nFirst, cognitive processes associated with sense faculties that are\nunimpaired by extraneous causes of misperception grasp the former\nobjects, and because this kind of object fulfils realistic mundane\nontological standard, it is thus real for ordinary beings,\n(not so for the noble beings the issue to which we turn later). Hence\nit is only conventionally real.\n\nSecond, cognitive processes associated with sense faculties that are\nimpaired by extraneous causes of misperception grasp conventionally\nunreal objects, and because this kind of object does not meet\nrealistic mundane ontological standard, they are thus\nconventionally unreal.\n\nAlthough Candrak\u012brti recognises that conventional reality\nsatisfies the ontological standard of ordinary beings, he,\nimportantly, argues that it does not satisfy the ontological criterion\nof the Madhyamaka (here synonymous for noble beings). Just as illusion\nis partly real although partly unreal, all objects\nthat are considered commonsensically as conventionally real, are\nunreal. The major difference between the two is that a\nknowledge of illusion being unreal is available to mundane cognitive\nprocesses of ordinary beings where as a knowledge of unreality of\nconventionally real entities is not available to mundane cognitive\nprocesses of ordinary beings.\n\nHowever, for Candrak\u012brti illusory objects are\nconventionally real and causally efficient, and that the\nconventionally real entities themselves are illusion-like.\nCandrak\u012brti develops this argument using the two tier theory of\nillusion.\n\nThe argument from the first tier of the theory of illusion\ndemonstrates a causal efficiency of conventionally illusory objects.\nThis, Candrak\u012brti does by identifying conventionally\nillusory entities with the so-called conventionally real\nentities.\nThe argument from the second tier of the theory of illusion\ndemonstrates an illusory nature of conventionally\nreal entities. This, Candrak\u012brti does by means of showing\nthat entities that are conventionally real are conventionally\nempty of intrinsic reality, and by denying conventional\nreality the ontological status of the so-called intrinsic\nreality.\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti support his argument from the theory of illusion by\nmeans of applying four categories of the conventional entities:\n\nPartly unreal entities\u2014illusory objects (e.g. mirage,\nreflection, echoe etc.);\nPartly real entities\u2014non-illusory objects (e.g. water, face,\nsound etc.);\nIntrinsic reality (e.g. substance, essence, intrinsic nature\netc.,) and\nConventionally unreal entities (e.g. the rabbit\u2019s horn, the\nsky-flower etc). ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n254b\u2013255a).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti accepts conventional reality of both\nentities\u2014partly unreal (i) and partly real (ii)\u2014on the\nground that they both appear in mundane cognitive processes who are\nconfused about their ultimate ontological status. Candrak\u012brti\nrejects conventional reality status of those entities that are\nsupposedly intrinsically real (iii) and conventionally unreal (iv),\nalthough for different reasons. Conventional reality of intrinsically\nreal entity is rejected in [MBh] 6.28 on the ground that its existence\ndoes not, forever, appear to a mundane cognitive processes.\n\nCandrak\u012brti argues that there is a critical epistemic\ndifferentiation to be made between the two\nentities\u2014conventionally real and conventionally illusory.\nDeceptive, unreal, and dependently arisen nature of conventionally\nreal entities is beyond the grasp of mundane cognitive processes. By\ncontrast, deceptive, unreal and dependently arisen nature of\nconventionally illusory, partly unreal, entities is grasped by mundane\ncognitive processes. Therefore illusory objects are regarded as\ndeceptive, and unreal by the standard of mundane knowledge, whereas,\nconventionally real things are regarded as nondeceptive and real by\nthe standard of mundane knowledge.\n\nSo the argument from the first tier of the illusory theory shows that\nmundane cognitive processes of ordinary beings fail to know\nillusory and unreal nature of conventionally real entities, they\ninstead grasp them to be intrinsically real. The argument from the\nsecond tier of the illusory theory offers Candrak\u012brti\u2019s reason\nwhy this is so. Here, he argues, the presence of the underlying\nconfusion operating beneath mundane cognitive processes of the\nordinary beings is the force by which ordinary beings intuitively and\nerroneously reify the nature of conventional entities. Hence they grasp\nconventional entities as intrinsically real, although they are in\nactual fact on a closer analysis, only non-intrinsic, unreal or\nillusory.\n\nTherefore intrinsic reality is not a conventional reality and grasping\nthings to be intrinsically real is only a confused belief, not a\nknowledge. Hence Candrak\u012brti clearly excludes it from the\nontological categories of conventional reality, for the reason that\nintrinsic reality is a conceptual fiction fabricated by confused minds\nof the ordinary beings and that it is a conceptual construct thrust\nupon non-intrinsic entities ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n255a). In addition Candrak\u012brti argues that if things were\nintrinsically real, even conventionally, as the Sv\u0101tantrikas take\nthem to be, in Candrak\u012brti\u2019s view, things would exist by virtue\nof their intrinsic reality, at least conventionally. If this\nwere the case then intrinsic reality would become the ultimate nature\nof things. That would be absurd.\n\nFor M\u0101dhyamikas, things cannot have more than one final mode of\nexistence\u2014if they exist, they must exist qua only\nconventionally. Consequently, given the mutually exclusive relation of\nintrinsic reality and emptiness, if intrinsic reality is granted even\na conventional reality status, Candrak\u012brti contends, one has to\nreject emptiness as the ultimate reality ([M] 6.34, DBu ma\n\u2018a 205b). But since the M\u0101dhyamika asserts emptiness to be\nthe ultimate reality, and given that emptiness and intrinsic reality\nare mutually exclusive, M\u0101dhyamika must reject intrinsic reality\nin all its forms\u2014conventionally as well as ultimately ([MBh]\n6.36, 1994: 118).\n4.2.2 Ultimate truth\n\nWe now turn to Candrak\u012brti\u2019s second thesis\u2014namely, only\nwhat is ultimately non-intrinsic is causally effective, for\nonly those phenomena, an ultimate nature of which is non-intrinsic,\nare subject to conditioned arising. Ultimate reality (or emptiness),\ngiven it is causally effective, is therefore intrinsically unreal.\nTherefore ultimate reality is ultimately unreal (or put it\ndifferently, emptiness is ultimately empty).\n\nCandrak\u012brti defines ultimate reality as the nature of things\nfound by the perception of reality ([M] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a\n205a). In the commentary Candrak\u012brti expands this definition.\n\u201cUltimate is the object, the nature of which is found by\nparticular exalted cognitive processes (yishes) of those who\nperceive reality. But it does not exist by virtue of its intrinsic\nobjective reality (svar\u016bpat\u0101 / bdag gi ngo bo\nnyid).\u201d ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a 253a) Of the two\nnatures, the object of the perception of reality is the way things\nreally are, and this is, Candrak\u012brti explains, what it means to\nbe ultimate reality ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a 253ab).\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s definition raises a couple of important points\nhere. First, by defining ultimate reality as \u201cthe nature of\nthings found by particular exalted cognitive processes (yeshes) of\nthose who perceive reality,\u201d he means ultimate reality is not\nfound by any exalted cognitive processes, it must be found by\na particular exalted cognitive processes\u2014analytic\u2014that\nknows things just as they are. Second, by stating that \u201cit does\nnot exist by virtue of its intrinsic objective reality\u201d\n(svar\u016bpat\u0101 / bdag gi ngo bo nyid), he means ultimate reality\nis not intrinsically real just as much as conventional reality is not\nintrinsically real. Third, he says that ultimate reality is the first\nnature of the two natures of things found by perception of reality.\nThis means ultimate reality is ultimate nature of all conventionally\nreal things. For they all have an ultimate nature representing\nultimate status, just as they have conventional nature representing\nconventional status.\n\nUltimate truth, according to Candrak\u012brti, for the purpose of\nliberating all sentient beings ([M] 6.179 Dbu ma \u2018a\n213a). \u2018a 213a) is differentiated by the Buddha into two\naspects:\n\nnonself of person (pudgalanair\u0101tmya) and\nnonself of phenomena (dharmanair\u0101tmya)\n\n\nAs we shall see Candrak\u012brti\u2019s arguments come from two domains of\nanalysis which he employs to account for his theory of ultimate truth:\nanalysis of personal self (pudgala-\u0101tmya / gang zag gi bdag) and\nanalysis of phenomenal self (dharma-\u0101tmya / chos kyi bdag). The\nanalysis will demonstrate whether or not conventionally real phenomena\nand persons are more than what they are conventionally. So we shall\nconsider Candrak\u012brti\u2019s arguments under this rubrics:\n\nThe not-self argumnent: unreality of conventionally real\nperson;\nThe emptiness argument: unreality of conventionally real\nphenomena;\nThe emptiness is emptiness argument: unreality of ultimate\nreality.\n\n\nLet us begin with the first. The not-self argumnent demonstrates, as\nwe shall see, unreality of conventionally real person. We shall\ndevelop this argument of Candrak\u012brti progressively in three\nsteps:\n\ncorrelation between personal self and the five aggregates;\narguments against personal self; and\nreasons for positing personal self as merely dependently\ndesignated.\n\n\nIn order to appreciate Candrak\u012brti\u2019s not-self argument, or the\nargument that shows unreality of conventionally real person, we need\nto understand Candrak\u012brti\u2019s purpose of refuting personal self.\nAccording to Candrak\u012brti it is important that we look into the\nquestion: from where does the assumption of self arise before we go\nany further. He argues, like all the Buddhist philosophers do, the\nnotion of self or the assumption of self arises in relation to\npersonhood. After all it is a personal identity issue. To analyse the\nself therefore requires us to look closely among the parts that\nconstitute a person, and given that the conception of self is embedded\nin personhood which is constituted by the five aggregates, we need to\nexamine its relation to our conception of self.\n\nSuffice it here to highlight the important relation that exists\nbetween the aggregates and the notion of self. According to\nCandrak\u012brti, the five aggregates are primary categories upon\nwhich we will draw to examine the phenomenal structure of sentient\nbeings, because of the following reasons: because (1) it serves as a\nphenomenological scheme for examining the nature of human experience,\n(2) the way in which human beings construct conceptions of the self is\nbased upon different existential experiences within the framework of\nthe five aggregates, (3) they are the basis upon which we develop the\nsense of self through the view that objectifies the five aggregates\nwhich are transient and composites\n(satk\u0101ya\u1e0d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di / \u2018jig tshogs la lta\nba), either through an appropriation or falsely identifying the\naggregates to be self ([MBh] 6.120, Dbu ma \u2018a 292ab),\n(4) they are the objective domain of the arising of defilements that\ncause us suffering since the false view objectifying the aggregates\n(satk\u0101ya\u1e0d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di / \u2018jig tshogs la lta\nba) to be real self lead to the arising of all \u201cafflictive\ndefilements\u201d, and finally (5) the five aggregates are the\nobjective domain of the knowledge of unreality of personal self. For\nthe simple reason that confusion and misconceptions of self arise in\nrelation to the aggregates, thus it is within the same framework that\nthe realisation of nonself must emerge.\n\nTherefore, for Candrak\u012brti, it is clear that within the range of\nthe five aggregates exhaust \u201call\u201d or\n\u201ceverything\u201d that could be considered as the basis for\ndeveloping the misconception of a reified self and also the\nbasis for correct knowledge of non-self\u2014i.e., reality of person\nor self.\n\nCandrak\u012brti develops his arguments against personal self in a\ngreat detail in [M]/[Mbh] chapter six. Suffice it here to consider one\nsuch argument called \u201cthe argument from the sevenfold analysis\nof a chariot\u201d (shing rta rnams bdun gyi rigs pa). This argument\nhowever is more or less a way of putting all his arguments together.\nIn it, Candrak\u012brti concludes: \u201cthe basis of the conception\nof self, when analysed, is not plausible to be an entity. It is not\nplausible to be different from the aggregates, nor identity of the\naggregates, nor dependent (skandhadh\u0101ra) on the aggregates. The\n\u2018basis\u2019 (skandhadh\u0101ra) at issue is a compound that\nexposes the implausibility of self as both the container\n(\u0101dh\u0101ra / rten) and the contained (adheya / brten pa). The\nself does not own the aggregates. This is established in codependence\non the aggregates\u201d ([M] 6.150, Dbu ma \u2018a 221b).\nPutting this argument analogically, Candrak\u012brti asserts that the\nself is, in terms of not being intrinsically real, analogous to a\nchariot. \u201cWe do not accept a chariot to be different from its\nown parts, nor to be identical [to its parts], nor to be in possession\nof them, nor is it in the parts, nor are the parts in it, nor\nis it the mere composite [of its parts], nor is it the shape [or size\nof the those parts]\u201d ([M] 6.151 Dbu ma \u2018a\n221b).\n\nSo the structure of the nonself \u201cchariot\u201d argument that\ndemonstrates unreality of a conventionally real person can be briefly\nstated as follows:\n\nP1\u00a0 Self is not distinct from the aggregates.\n P2\u00a0 Self is not identical to the aggregates.\n P3\u00a0 Self and the aggregates are not codependent upon each\nother.\n P4\u00a0 Self and the aggregates do not own each other.\n P5\u00a0 Self is not the shape of the aggregates.\n P6\u00a0 Self is not the collection of the aggregates.\n P7\u00a0 There is nothing more to a person than the five\naggregates.\n C\u00a0 Therefore a real personal self does not exist.\n\n\nThere is no ultimately real self that can be logically proven to\nexist. If it did exist it has to be found when it is subjected to\nthese sevenfold analyses. But the self is not found either to be\ndifferent from the aggregates, nor identical to the aggregates, nor to\nbe in possession of them, nor is the self in the aggregates,\nnor are the aggregates in the self, nor is the self the mere\ncomposite of the aggregates; nor is the self the shape or sizes of the\naggregates. Since there is no more to a person any more than\ndependently designated self upon basis of the five aggregates, they\nexhaust all that there is in a person, Candrak\u012brti therefore\nconcludes that there is no real self anywhere whatsoever to be found\nin the five aggregates.\n\nFrom this argument, Candrak\u012brti concludes that both ultimately\nand conventionally, any intrinsic reality of a personal self must\nremain unproven. Therefore according to any of the sevenfold analysis\na personal self is unreal, and empty of any intrinsic reality. What\nCandrak\u012brti does not conclude from this argument, though, is the\nimplausibility of a conventionally real self for everyday purpose. As\nmatter of fact, Candrak\u012brti argues, the argument from the\nsevenfold analysis reinforces the idea that only conventionally real\nself makes sense. For such a self constitutes being dependently\ndesignated on the aggregates in as much as a chariot is dependently\ndesignated on its parts (M / MBh 6.158). Just as the chariot\nis conveniently designated in dependence on its parts, and it is\nreferred to in the world as \u201cagent,\u201d even so, a\nconventionally self which is established through dependent designation\nserves as a conventionally real moral agent. Therefore, although the\nargument from the sevenfold analyses denies the existence of\nintrinsically real self or ultimately real self, the argument does not\nentail a denial of conventionally real self. (M / MBh\n6.159).\n\nIt turns out therefore that a self is merely a convenient designation,\nor a meaningful label given to the five aggregates, and taken for\ngranted in the everyday purpose as a agent. And it is this nominal\nself that serves the purpose of moral agent. This nominal or\nconventional self is comparable to anything that exists\nconventionally. Candrak\u012brti compares it to a chariot.\n\nSecond, Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument from emptiness demonstrates the\nunreality of the conventionally real phenomena by means of appealing\nto causal processes at work in producing these entities. The\nunderstanding here is that the way in which things arise and come into\nexistence definitively informs us about how things actually are. This\nargument is an extension of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s famous tetralemma\nargument which states: \u201cneither from itself nor from another nor\nfrom both, nor without cause does anything anywhere, ever\narise.\u201d ([MMK] 1.1) Candrak\u012brti develops this argument in\ngreat detail in chapter 6 of [M]/[MBh], we shall only have a quick look\nat its overall strategy without delving into its details.\n\nIf entities are intrinsically real there are only two alternative ways\nfor them to arise: either they arise (a) causally or (b) causelessly.\nIf one holds that intrinsically real things arise causally, then there\nare only three possible ways for them to arise: either they should\narise from (1) themselves, or from (2) another or from (3) both.\n\n\nP1 If intrinsic entity arise from itself it would absurdly follow that\ncause and effect would be identical and they would exist\nsimultaneously. In which case, the production of an effect would be\npointless for it would be already in existence. It is thus\nunreasonable to assume that something already arisen might arise all\nover again. ([M] 6.8) If an entity in existence still requires arising\nthen an infinite regress would follow ([M] 6. 9\u201313).\n\nP2 If an intrinsically real entity arises from another, anything could\narise from anything (like a fire from pitch-darkness), given that\ncause and effect would be distinct, all causes would be equally\n\u2018another\u2019 ([M] 6. 14\u201321).\n\nP3 If an intrinsic entity arises from both itself and another then\nboth reductio ad absurdums in P1 and P2 would apply ([M] 6.\n98).\n\nP4 If an intrinsic entity arises causelessly, then anything could\narise from everything ([M] 6. 99\u2013103).\n\nThus it is not possible for any intrinsic entity to exist because no\nsuch entity could be causally produce either from itself or from\nanother or both or causelessly. It follows therefore that any entity\nthat arises causally is not intrinsically real, hence it is\ndependently originated entity ([M] 6. 104).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti therefore insists that entities that are\nintrinsically unreal are not nonexistent unlike intrinsically real\nentities which are nonexistent analogous to the rabbit\u2019s horn. Even\nthough they are not intrinsically real, hence remain unproduced\naccording to the four analyses, unlike the rabbit\u2019s horn,\nintrinsically unreal entities are objects of mundane cognitive\nprocesses, and they arise codependently ([M] 110\u2013114). Hence, in\nsummarising the argument, Candrak\u012brti states: \u201cEntities do\nnot arise causelessly, and they do not arise through causes like God,\nfor example. Nor do they arise out of themselves, nor from another,\nnor from both. They arise codependently.\u201d ([M] 6.114, Dbu ma\n\u2018a 209b) So because entities arise codependently, according to\nCandrak\u012brti, reified concepts such as intrinsic entities cannot\nstand up under logical analysis. The argument from dependent arising\ntherefore eliminates the web of erroneous views presupposing intrinsic\nreality. If entities are intrinsically real, then their arising could\nbe through themselves, from another or from both, causelessly. However\nupon critical analysis the entity as such proves to be nonexistent\n([M]/[MBh] 6. 115\u2013116).\n\nThird, Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument from the emptiness of emptiness\ndemonstrates the unreality of ultimate reality. The\n\u201cemptiness-argument\u201d and the\n\u201cnonself-argument\u201d show that all conventionally real\nphenomena and persons are empty of intrinsic reality. As we have seen\nfrom a critical rational point of view, it is demonstrated that there\nis no ultimately real or ultimately existent entities or real self of\nperson to be found. The two arguments do not however show that\nemptiness per se is empty, nor do they show that the\nselflessness is itself selfless. This raises an important question:\ndoes this mean that emptiness is the intrinsic reality of\nconventionally real entities and selflessness is the intrinsic reality\nof conventionally real persons? Putting the question differently:\ncould a M\u0101dhyamika claim that emptiness and selflessness are\nultimately real or are intrinsically real? This question is\nreasonable. We tend to posit ultimate reality to be something that is\ntimeless, independent, transcendent, nondual etc. So if emptiness is\nthe ultimate reality of all phenomena and if selflessness is the\nultimate reality of all persons,could we say that emptiness and\nselflessness are nonempty, ultimately real or\nintrinsically real?\n\nIn order to answer this question Candrak\u012brti maintains that the\nBuddha reclassifies emptiness and nonself under various\naspects\u2014\u201cHe elaborated sixteen emptinesses and\nsubsequently he condensed these into four explanations which are\nadopted by the Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\u201d ([M] 6.180 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 213a) We shall consider one example here: Candrak\u012brti\nargues \u201cThe eye is empty of eye[ness] because that is its\nreality. The ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are also to be explained\nin this way.\u201d ([M] 6.181 Dbu ma \u2018a 213ab)\n\u201cBecause each of them are non-eternal (ther zugs tu\ngnas pa ma yin) not subject to disintegration\n(\u2018jig pa ma yin pa) and their reality is\nnon-intrinsic [the emptiness of] the eye and the other six\nfaculties is accepted as \u2018internal emptiness\u2019\n(adhy\u0101tma\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\u201d([M] 6.181\nDbu ma \u2018a 2213b).\n\nOn Candrak\u012brit\u2019s view just as the chariot, self and other\nconventionally real phenomena are intrinsically unreal, so too is the\nemptiness and the nonself. Emptiness is also empty of intrinsic\nreality. Candrak\u012brti explains the emptiness of emptiness as:\n\nThe emptiness of intrinsic reality of things is itself called by the\nwise as \u2018emptiness,\u2019 and this emptiness also is considered\nto be empty of any intrinsic reality. ([M] 6.185 Dbu\nma \u2018a 213b) \nThe emptiness of that which is called\n\u2018emptiness\u2019 is accepted as \u2018the emptiness of\nemptiness\u2019 (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). It is\nexplained in this way for the purpose of controverting objectification\nof the emptiness as intrinsically real (bh\u0101va). ([M] 6.186\nDbu ma \u2018a 213b)\n\n\nAlso consider Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument against positing emptiness\nas ultimately real that he develops in his commentary on [MMK] 13.7.\nIf emptiness is ultimately real, emptiness would not be empty of the\nintrinsic reality\u2014the essence of conventionally real objects. In\nthat case we will have to grant emptiness as existing independently of\nconventionally real entities, as their underlying substratum. If this\nis granted the emptiness of a chariot and the empty entity, the\nchariot itself, would be quite distinct and unrelated. Moreover if the\nemptiness of the chariot is nonempty, i.e., if it is ultimately real,\nwhereas the chariot itself is empty i.e., ultimately unreal, then, one\nhas to posit two distinct and contradictory verifiable realities even\nfor one conventionally real chariot. But since there is not even the\nslightest nonempty phenomenon verified in the chariot\u2014not even\nthe slightest bit of entity withstanding critical\nanalysis\u2014emptiness of the chariot, like the chariot itself, is\nimplausible to be ultimately real. Like the chariot itself, the\nemptiness of the chariot is also ultimately empty.\n\nTherefore, while emptiness is the ultimate truth of the conventionally\nreal entities, it is not plausible to posit emptiness to be ultimately\nreal. Similarly, while nonself is the ultimate truth of the personal\nself, nonself is implausible to be ultimately real. Therefore nonself\nis not considered as the essence of persons or self.\n\nSo, to wind up the discussion on the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of\nthe two truths, just as conventional truth is empty of intrinsic\nreality, hence ultimately unreal, even so, is ultimate truth empty of\nintrinsic reality, hence ultimately unreal. It is, therefore,\ndemonstrated that nothing is ultimately real for Candrak\u012brti,\nhence everything is empty of intrinsic reality. The heart of\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s two truths theory is the argument that only because\nthey are empty of intrinsic reality can conventionally real entities\nbe causally efficient. Only in the context of a categorical rejection\nof any foundationalism of intrinsic reality\u2014both conventionally\nand ultimate, Candrak\u012brti insists, can there be mundane practices\nrooted in the mutually interdependent character of cognitive\nprocesses and objects cognised. For this reason\nCandrak\u012brti concludes that whomsoever emptiness makes sense,\neverything makes sense. For whomsoever emptiness makes no sense,\ndependent arising would not make sense. Hence nothing would make sense\n([PP] 24.14, Dbu ma \u2018a 166b).\n5. Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, though this entry provides just an overview of the theory\nof the two truths in Indian Buddhism discussed overview, it\nnevertheless offers us enough reasons to believe that there is no\nsingle theory of the two truths in Indian Buddhism. As we\nhave seen there are many such competing theories, some of which are\nhighly complex and sophisticated. The essay clearly shows, however,\nthat except for the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of the two truths,\nwhich unconditionally rejects all forms of foundationalism\nboth conventionally and ultimately, all other theories of the two\ntruths, while rejecting some forms of foundationalism, embrace another\nform of foundationalism. The S\u0101rvastiv\u0101din (or\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika) theory rejects the substance-metaphysics of the\nBrahmanical schools, yet it claims the irreducible spatial units\n(e.g., atoms of the material category) and irreducible temporal units\n(e.g., point-instant consciousnesses) of the five basic categories as\nultimate truths, which ground conventional truth, which is comprised\nof only reducible spatial wholes or temporal continua. Based on the\nsame metaphysical assumption and although with modified definitions,\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika argues that the unique particulars\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which, they say, are ultimately causally\nefficient, are ultimately real; whereas the universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which are only\nconceptually constructed, are only conventionally real. Rejecting the\n\u0100bhidharmika realism, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra proposes a form of\nidealism in which which it is argued that only mental impressions are\nconventionally real and nondual perfect nature is the ultimately real.\nThe Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka, however, rejects both the\n\u0100bhidharmika realism and the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism as\nphilosophically incoherent. It argues that things are only\nintrinsically real, conventionally, for this ensures their\ncausal efficiency, things do not need to be ultimately intrinsically\nreal. Therefore it proposes the theory which states that\nconventionally all phenomena are intrinsically real\n(svabh\u0101vata\u1e25) whereas ultimately all phenomena are\nintrinsically unreal (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25). Finally, the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka rejects all the theories of the two\ntruths including the one advanced by its Madhyamaka counterpart,\nnamely, Sv\u0101tantrika, on the ground that all the theories are\nmetaphysically too stringent, and they do not provide the ontological\nmalleability necessary for the ontological identity of conventional\ntruth (dependent arising) and ultimate truth (emptiness). It therefore\nproposes the theory of the two truths in which the notion of intrinsic\nreality is categorically denied. It argues that only when conventional\ntruth and ultimate truth are both conventionally and\nultimately non-intrinsic, can they be causally effective.\n",
