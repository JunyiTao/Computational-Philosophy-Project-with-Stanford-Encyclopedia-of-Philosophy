    "main_text": "Applications || Philosophy of Biology and Natural Selection\n5.4 Philosophy of Biology and Natural Selection\n\nWithin the philosophy of biology, the units of\nselection debate (Sober 2000 [2018: ch. 4], 2014; Williams\n1966) concerns whether natural selection operates only at the level of\nthe individual or also on groups (where the individual is typically\nconceived either as the organism or the gene). This debate is\nespecially important for understanding the evolution of altruism\n(Sober & Wilson 1999). Since altruistic individuals harm their own\nchances of survival and reproduction, they are less fit, and it is\nthus unclear how altruism could evolve as a result of natural\nselection. If, however, groups with more altruists are fitter than\ngroups with fewer, and selection can act on groups, this could\npotentially explain how altruism could still evolve. Within the units\nof selection debate, Simpson reversals have played an\nimportant role in explaining the possibility of group-level\nselection.\n\nConsider the following naive argument against the conceptual\npossibility of group-level\n selection.[12]\n Suppose that we define the fitness of a group as the average fitness\nof its individuals. In this context, altruistic individuals are, by\ndefinition, those with traits that reduce their individual fitness\nwhile improving the fitness of other group members. For instance,\ncrows that issue warning cries when a predator approaches benefit the\ngroup while increasing the chances of being harmed themselves. Natural\nselection explains the evolution of traits on the basis that\nindividuals with the trait are fitter than those without it (all else\nbeing equal). Since selfish individuals are by definition fitter than\naltruistic ones, it follows that groups with more altruistic\nindividuals cannot be fitter. Or so one might argue.\n\nBy now it should be clear what is wrong with this type of\nargument\u2014it does not follow from the fact that altruistic\nindividuals are less fit than selfish ones in every population that\npopulations which average over selfish and altruistic individuals\ncannot be fitter than populations with just selfish individuals. It\ncould be that being an altruist is correlated with being in a\npopulation with more altruists, and that populations with more\naltruists are fitter. This dispenses with the naive argument. Note,\nhowever, that within every single group selfish individuals are\nfitter, so if the groups change membership only through reproduction\n(as opposed to migration and mutation) then over enough generations\nevery group will end up consisting only of selfish individuals. So\nwhether groups selection can occur depends on additional facts about\npopulation structure and dynamics. Hamilton\u2019s (1964) Kin\nSelection theory explains how altruism can evolve in cases where\naltruists are more likely to associate with other altruists (possibly\nbecause it runs in the family).\n\nThe group selection hypothesis remains controversial among biologists.\nThe present discussion reveals how the phenomenon of Simpson\u2019s\nParadox is relevant to theorizing how it might be possible, and more\nbroadly reveals how philosophical work on causation and probability\ncan aid in clarifying scientific debates.\n\nRecently, Simpson\u2019s Paradox has been invoked in an ongoing\ndebate regarding whether natural selection should be understood as\ncausal or statistical. Walsh (2010), a prominent defender of the\nstatistical view, points to cases of Simpson\u2019s Paradox as\nshowing that selection cannot be understood causally, and Otsuka,\nTurner, Allen, & Lloyd (2011) rebut this claim. An important point\nthat emerges from this debate is that the term\n\u201cpopulation\u201d is used differently in discussions of\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox than it is in biology (cf. Weinberger 2018).\nWalsh presents an example in which a correlation in a population\ndisappears when one splits the population into two parts. As Otsuka et\nal. point out, within population genetics, population size can be\ncausally relevant to the fitness of its individuals. Note that\nWalsh\u2019s example of dividing a population in half is not what we\nhave been talking about in the context of Simpson\u2019s Paradox. In\nthe prior discussion, dividing the population was not a matter of\nchanging its size, but rather of partitioning its probability\ndistribution based on a variable.\n",
