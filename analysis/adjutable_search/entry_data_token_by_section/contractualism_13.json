If\nall moral obligations are between parties to the social contract, then\nwe have no obligations regarding animals who cannot be parties to the\ncontract. So (for instance) torturing non-rational animals cannot be\nwrong. By contrast, utilitarians have no difficulty explaining why it\nis wrong to torture animals. This seems to place contractualism at a\ncomparative disadvantage. Can contractualism provide an adequate\naccount of our moral obligations to animals? Does it need to?\n\nScanlon offers two solutions. The first is to limit the scope of his\naccount. Contractualism is not an account of the whole of morality,\nbut only an account of the morality of what we owe to other persons.\nThis leaves open the possibility that our obligations to animals fall\noutside this part of morality. Scanlon also explicitly puts aside any\nmoral obligations we might have in regard to the natural environment\n(Scanlon 1998, p. 179). \n\nScanlon also suggests a possible way that obligations to animals could\nbe accommodated within contractualism. This is via the notion of\ntrustees, to whom justifications of proposed principles can be\noffered, on behalf of the animals they represent (Scanlon 1998, p.\n183).\n\nUtilitarians will object that this second solution provides too\nindirect an account of what ultimately grounds our obligations to\nanimals. The fact that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary pain on\nanimals is not most plausibly explained via the notion of whether this\nbehaviour could be justified to a trustee of the animals. Rather, it\nis wrong simply because of the suffering the animal feels. A\nutilitarian will add that, once we realise that this is what is wrong\nin the case of animal suffering, we should draw the same conclusion\nabout human suffering. It is their capacity for suffering rather than\ntheir capacity for rational agency that plays the most salient role in\nexplaining the wrongness of torturing humans.\n\nA contractualist can reply as follows. Contractualism captures the\ncentral sense of wrongness, one that plays a role in how individuals\nunderstand what they are accountable to one another for. The case of\nanimals shows that this is not the only notion of wrongness. But, once\nwe reflect on the differences between the two cases, we see why our\nobligations to one another are so different from any obligations we\nmight have to animals\u2014precisely because we cannot meaningfully\njustify ourselves to them. Animals are not a special problem\nfor the contractualist, but rather an opportunity to explore what is\ndistinctive about the contractualist approach.\n",
