    "main_text": "Moral impartiality II: Deontological moral theories || Impartiality and universalizability\n4.2 Impartiality and universalizability\n\nOn many deontological views, particularly Kantian ones, the\nsignificance of moral impartiality is seen as arising from the fact\nthat a core role is given to the concept of universalizability (Gert\n1998; Hare 1981; Kant 1964 [1785]; Kohlberg 1979). The requirement\nthat moral judgments be universalizable is, roughly, the requirement\nthat such judgments be independent of any particular point of view.\nThus, an agent who judges that A ought morally to do\nX in situation S ought to be willing to endorse the\nsame judgment whether she herself happens to be A, or some\nother individual involved in the situation (someone who, perhaps, will\nbe directly affected by A\u2019s actions), or an entirely\nneutral observer. Her particular identity is completely irrelevant in\nthe determination of the correctness or appropriateness of the\njudgment.\n\nUniversalizability, thus formulated, does imply at least one sort of\nimpartiality: an agent whose judgments are universalizable will be\nmorally consistent, in the sense that she will judge her own actions\nby the same standards she applies to others. Such an agent will not\nmake an exception of herself by allowing herself to break a rule she\nregards as binding for others, or to perform any other action which\nshe would not accept if performed by another agent. Impartiality of\nthis sort, however, does not necessarily imply any sort of\nimpartiality with respect to other individuals\u2019 interests,\nrights, or claims. On a minimally demanding interpretation of the\nuniversalizability requirement, the judgments made by a person whose\nconception of the good was intrinsically racist \u2013 that is, a\nperson who held that the well-being of members of some one particular\nrace mattered more (or less), objectively speaking, than the\nwell-being of members of other races \u2013 could very well turn out\nto be universalizable, so long as the racist held that his judgments\nwere objectively correct, and so ought to be assented to by all\nindividuals \u2013 including those individuals who would be\ndisadvantaged by the general adoption of those views (cf. Gewirth\n1978, 164; Gert 1998, Chapter 6; Wiggins 1978; Williams 1985,\n115).\n\nHowever, the conclusion that the racist\u2019s judgments are\nuniversalizable presupposes a very minimal account of what\nuniversalizability requires. On this account, it requires only that an\nagent be sincerely committed to the objectivity of his judgments, in\nthe sense that he views them (from his current perspective) as correct\nfrom all perspectives, and thus as calling for everyone\u2019s assent\n(whether or not that assent is actually given.) (Cf. Parfit 2011, I,\n323\u201324) There are two ways of making the universalizability\nrequirement more demanding. The first is to appeal to certain\ncounterfactual claims about what the agent would endorse if\nhe actually did occupy various perspectives. On this view, a\nparticular judgment by A is universalizable if and only if\nA endorses that judgment from his current perspective,\nand would endorse the same judgment from any other\nperspective. Given this understanding of universalizability, it\nis much less likely \u2013 indeed, extraordinarily unlikely \u2013\nthat racist views will turn out to be universalizable; for it is not\ngenerally true of individuals that they would endorse the view\n\u201cThe well-being of members of race R matters less than\nthe well-being of members of other races\u201d if they themselves\nwere members of race R. However, such a view may well require\ntoo much, for there are few if any moral judgments or principles that\nwould be endorsed from every perspective any given agent\nmight occupy.\n\nA different approach to universalizability eschews the appeal to\npsychological facts altogether, and holds that whether or not a\nparticular judgment is universalizable is a logical fact rather than a\npsychological one. Kant\u2019s categorical imperative test, for\nexample, holds that universalizability is the distinguishing feature\nof correct moral judgments, and that a judgment is universalizable if\nand only if it can, without contradiction, be willed as a universal\npractical law (Kant 1964 [1785]). Since the test hinges on whether the\nwilling of a judgment as a universal law results in a\ncontradiction, it follows that whether or not a judgment\nis universalizable in this way is a matter of practical\nreason, and does not depend on which particular individual\u2019s\nwill happens to be involved.\n\nThe types of impartiality implied by both of these more demanding\nversions of the universalizability requirement are likely to be\nconsiderably more substantial than the formal consistency required by\nthe minimal version. Kant, for instance, seems to hold that\nuniversalizability implies a certain level of altruism or charity, in\nthe form of the imperfect duties we owe towards other individuals.\nThere are problems, however, with Kant\u2019s argument for this. In\nparticular, it is not clear just how the universal willing of a maxim\nsuch as \u201cWhen others are in need of help, I always ignore their\nneeds\u201d give rise to any sort of contradiction. It is\ntrue, of course, that, were we actually in a position to choose the\nuniversal maxims on which all rational persons would act, this would\nbe a poor choice, for we might someday be in need of assistance from\nanother. But to say that the willing of this maxim as a universal law\nwould be imprudent is not to say that doing so is\ncontradictory. Moreover, as David Wiggins (1978) points out,\ncertain other actions that seem as if they ought to be morally\npermissible \u2013 the act, for instance, of releasing a debtor from\nhis debt out of generosity \u2013 have maxims that seem to fail the\nuniversalizability test so conceived. These examples may point to a\ngeneral problem with the attempt to derive impartiality from\nuniversalizability: whereas the latter, at least on a Kantian\ninterpretation, is a formal property of moral judgments, moral\nimpartiality, as we have seen, is a substantive rather than a formal\nconcept. (See Herman 1993 and Korsgaard 1996 for attempts to respond\nto these problems.)\n\nIt should be mentioned that some moral theorists have attempted to\nderive various versions of consequentialist impartiality more or less\ndirectly from the universalizability requirement (Hare 1981, Cummiskey\n1996, Pettit 2000; see also Harsanyi 1982). However, the claim that a\nconception of impartiality that is not only substantive but also\nextraordinarily demanding can be derived from a requirement which, as\njust pointed out, is essentially a formal one, continues to strike a\nmajority of moral philosophers as dubious.\n",
