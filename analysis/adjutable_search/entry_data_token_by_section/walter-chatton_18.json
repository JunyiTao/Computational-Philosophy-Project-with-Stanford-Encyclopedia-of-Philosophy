Virtues and Intentions\n\nThroughout the late 1320s and into the 1330s Chatton became\nincreasingly interested in questions of virtue and vice, the objects\nof moral acts, and the role of intentions in\n ethics.[12]\n Much of what he says follows or agrees with Scotus and opposes\nOckham.\n\nMediaeval philosophers often made much of the distinction between\nwilling or intending to do a thing and actually doing it. Let \\(A\\) be\nany action that a human being might contemplate, choose, and want to\nexecute. Then person \\(P\\)\u2019s willing \\(A\\) is\nconsidered an interior act with respect to \\(A\\), because the\nwilling is internal to the human soul. This is meant to contrast with\nthe corresponding exterior act, that is, the event that \\(P\\)\nactually executes \\(A\\). Note that \\(A\\) itself may be in\nsome sense \u2018interior\u2019, e.g., let \\(A =\\) thinking well of\nmy enemy. Then, although \\(A\\) is itself internal inasmuch as thinking\ntakes place in my mind, nevertheless we can distinguish the interior\nact of willing to think well of my enemy from the exterior\nact thinking well of my enemy. Thus \u2018interior\u2019\nand \u2018exterior\u2019 here signify primarily the distinction\nbetween choosing to do \\(A\\) and doing \\(A\\), not so much the internal\nand external activities per se.\n\nIt was Ockham\u2019s considered view, evidenced in many of his\nwritings, that only the interior act was properly regarded as\nmeritorious or sinful; the corresponding exterior act makes no moral\ndifference. Ockham is unwilling to allow external factors to play any\nsignificant role in moral evaluation. Chatton argues against this in\nmany ways, the most effective being theological: for example, Christ\nalways willed to redeem humanity, so if willing were sufficient, then\nhis exterior act of being executed on the cross was unnecessary.\nSimilarly, intending to confess would be as meritorious as actually\nconfessing. However, Chatton also points out several philosophical\ndisadvantages to Ockham\u2019s overall position.\n\nOckham\u2019s insistence that the interior act alone is subject to\nmoral appraisal leads him to pack as much as he can into the act of\nwill to be evaluated, and Chatton often criticized this strategy as\ndisingenuous. For example, Ockham seemed to think of the objects of\nmoral acts as anything the intellect needs to consider in advising the\nwill to act, including even the circumstances under which the act is\ndone; acts are finely distinguished with circumstances as a part of\ntheir identity conditions. For example, we cannot evaluate the\ninternal act \u2018willing to tell a lie\u2019, since it is too\ngeneral; to properly identify and evaluate this interior act we must\nspecify it with all its morally relevant circumstances. So, strictly\nspeaking, we should rather evaluate whether it is right to will to\ntell a lie to cover up a certain fact, to a certain person, to whom we\nare related in a certain way, etc.\n\nChatton opposed this view. The objects of moral acts can (and often\nshould) be thought of in a far more reduced sense, including only the\nexterior action of the actor himself, which the intellect approves and\nwhich the will then wills (that is, the case of virtuous\nacts). Circumstances are, properly speaking, variables existing on the\nperimeter of a moral act, while the objects and goals of acts are,\nproperly speaking, more intimate to the act itself. Chatton admits\nthat sometimes, when the will has a complex object that includes\ntemporal, causal, or locative qualifiers, these\n\u2018circumstances\u2019 can be said in a certain way to be an\nobject of the act. But such conditions, insofar as they are objects of\nthe act, are therefore not in the same way the environment\nsurrounding the act, and so are no longer really\ncircumstances in those cases. There are two practical\nimplications of this point. (1) Ockham writes and argues as though in\nhis ethics he considers only internal factors in moral evaluation, and\nexcludes the external completely, but this result is obtained only by\nsneaking in external factors through the back door, and building them\ninto the objects of the will, making them internal only by ad\nhoc stipulation. (2) If, with Chatton and against Ockham, we\nreject the idea that every act of will must include all its\ncircumstances as a partial object, we thereby make it possible to say\nthat some acts of will are intrinsically good (or bad) no matter what\ncircumstances they are done in. This possibility is important for\nOckhamist ethics, because Ockham insists that there is (and indeed\nthat there must be) at least one intrinsically good act of will, which\nhe identifies with loving God for his own sake. But if we always roll\nthe circumstances of an act up with the intended object of the act,\nthen it is possible to make any seemingly virtuous act wicked by\n\u2018in-building\u2019 bad intent, and so no act can be\nintrinsically virtuous. Chatton constructs this example against\nOckham:\n\nFor example, when I love my neighbor for the sake of God, it is\nrequired that love of God move me toward a love of neighbor. But this\nfact can be understood in two ways. (1) It can be understood that the\nobject taken as a whole is loved, that is, the entire object\nneighbor for the sake of God. In this case the act that has\nthis as an object can be done malevolently, say for the sake of\ndesirability, or more for the sake of desirability than for the glory\nof God. (2) Alternatively, my friend could be loved by me for the sake\nof God in the sense that love of God itself is the very thing that\nmoves me and causes my love of him. In this second case the love is\nvirtuous. (Quodlibet question 12, paragraph 14.)\n\n\nSimilarly, a person could love God for his own sake for the sake of\nsomething unworthy:\n\nI say that the act of \u2018loving God for his own sake\u2019 can,\nas a whole, be done malevolently; therefore, in order that it be done\nbenevolently, some additional necessary factor must be present. It is\nclear that this act can be done malevolently, since a person can have\nas his total object loving God for his own sake for the sake of\nmoney. (Quodlibet question 12, paragraph 13)\n\n\nIt might be objected that loving God for his own sake for the sake\nof money is an impossible object for the will, since good and\nevil objects or motives cancel each other out. But it is not clear how\nthis affects Chatton\u2019s point, since the human will really can\n(and sometimes does) have impossible objects and motives associated\nwith it.\n",
