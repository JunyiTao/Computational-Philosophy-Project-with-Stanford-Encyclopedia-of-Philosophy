    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysical arguments defend\nUpani\u1e63adic propositions claiming that existence is \u201cone\nonly, without a second\u201d (ChU 6.2.1). He follows the general\nUpani\u1e63adic model that all known objects are compounded\npermutations of a set of primary elements. This is modeled as\nthreefold, consisting of fire, water, and earth (ChU 6.2.3); or as\nfive-fold, consisting of space, air, fire, water, and earth (TaiU\n2.1.1; see BrS\u016bBh 2.3.1\u201312 for reconciling these two\ndifferent models). The elements emerge successively from\nundifferentiated existence, at first in subtle (i.e., non-perceptible)\nform. They then undergo a process of division and recombination, so\nthat each element includes portions of the others, to evolve into the\ncoarse (i.e., perceptible) \u201cgreat elements\u201d\n(mah\u0101bh\u016btas). Perceptual objects are in fact\nderivative products that lack existence independent of these primary\nelements. These elements, however, do not constitute an elemental\nfoundationalism, nor do they bottom out in an atomic foundationalism,\nbecause they are ultimately ontologically dependent on something else,\nnamely pure existence (brahman) (BrS\u016bBh\n2.2.15\u201317). Brahman is the nondual ground underlying\nall objects, the single foundation (adhi\u1e63\u1e6dhana)\non which the entire universe depends. All objects point back to this\nindependent ground and possess no existence apart from it.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara argues that this foundational existence has no\ndependence on a second thing. It is self-established, irreducible,\nimmutable, and free of space, time, and causation.\n\nAccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, a corollary of his position on\nnondual existence is that the world we perceive is less-than-real or\nillusory in some way in comparison to its ground. Though objects exist\nwithin existence, their forms are merely concepts that we represent\nwith names (see BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14 and ChUBh 6.1.4). They are\ncognitive constructions; however, in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s view\nthis construction is an epistemic error of attributing independent\nreality to objects, not an ontological subjective idealism of\nindividuals mentally projecting the world. His commentary on BrS\u016b\n2.2.28\u201331, for example, affirms that we must assume perceptual\nrealism and rejects Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism. By knowing\nnondual existence, one knows the reality of all things in the\nuniverse, and recognizes their forms as merely names. The immediate\nepistemic recognition of one\u2019s consciousness as numerically\nidentical with this ground of nondual existence is\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophical goal. This recognition is\nsynonymous with liberation (mok\u1e63a), and entails an\nabsolute metaphysical wholeness by which the individual\u2019s mind\nis freed from psychological suffering.\n",
