    "main_text": "Classic Work (1961\u20131966) || Hermeneutic Theory\n3.1 Hermeneutic Theory\n\nThe label that Althusser gave to the method by which he approached\nMarx\u2019s texts was that of a \u201csymptomatic reading.\u201d\nInstead of looking back at Marx\u2019s early work in order to find\nthe \u201cessence\u201d of his philosophy, one of whose expressions\nwas Capital, and also instead of trying to build a true or\nconsistent theory out of Marx\u2019s oeuvre by explaining away\ncontradictions within it and noting certain passages as key, Althusser\nargued that Marx\u2019s true philosophy was largely absent from his\nwork prior to 1845. Even in mature texts such as Capital,\nAlthusser maintained that Marx\u2019s philosophy remained largely\nimplicit, as the background system of concepts which allowed the\nscientific work Marx was involved in generating to take place. The\nsymptomatic method of reading was designed to make these concepts\nexplicit and \u201cto establish the indispensable minimum for the\nconsistent existence of Marxist philosophy\u201d\n(1965a [2005], 35).\n\nThe three inspirations Althusser gave for this interpretive method\nwere those provided by Spinoza, Freud by way of Lacan, and that\nprovided by Marx himself. In addition, he added to these examples\ninsights from the French tradition of historical epistemology about\nthe way in which sciences come to be constituted. One of the ideas\nborrowed from Spinoza was the contention that texts and authors are\nthe products of their times and that the thoughts authors set down on\nthe page cannot help but be a part of, and be affected by, the\nideological currents that accompany and allow for the satisfaction of\nneeds in a specific era. So then, similar to the way in which Spinoza\nargued in the Theological Political-Treatise that by engaging\nin a materialist historical study of the Bible one could disentangle\nthose prophetic laws and commands which were merely the result of\ntemporal exigencies and the prophet\u2019s imagination from those\nwhich represented the true word of God, so Althusser argued that one\ncould disentangle those concepts which were merely ideological in\nMarx\u2019s texts from those which comprised his true philosophy.\n\nThough this theory was later to be complicated and revised, during\nthis period, Althusser consistently argued that Marx\u2019s work\nprior to 1845 was ideological and that it was saturated with\nnon-Marxian concepts borrowed from Hegel\u2019s and Feuerbach\u2019s\nphilosophical anthropologies. Althusser did recognize that some of\nMarx\u2019s early work is marked by its rejection of idealist\npremises and concepts. However, inasmuch as this early work was seen\nto espouse a telic view of humanity in which the individual and\nsociety was said to undergo a necessary historico-dialectical\ndevelopment, Althusser identified it as fundamentally Hegelian. That\nthere was a materialist correction to this basic narrative with\nMarx\u2019s embrace of Feuerbach, Althusser also granted. However,\nthe replacement by Marx of a speculative anthropology which saw the\nhistorical development of society as the self-fulfillment of human\nfreedom with a materialist anthropology that cited the same logic of\ndevelopment but which specified that the motor of this development was\nhuman beings in their \u201csensuous life activity,\u201d was seen\nby Althusser to represent little conceptual and no logical advance\nfrom Hegel.\n\nThis \u201ctheory of the break,\u201d which held that Marx\u2019s\nearly work was Hegelian and ideological and that, after a decisive\nrupture in 1845 and then a long period of transition between\n1845\u20131857, his work became recognizably Marxist and scientific,\nwould seem to indicate that all one has to do to understand\nMarx\u2019s philosophy is to read this mature work. However, the\nactual case is not so simple. While reading Capital and other\nlate works is necessary for understanding Marx\u2019s philosophy, it\nis not sufficient. It is not sufficient, Althusser argued, because,\neven in his post-1857 writings, Marx provides no systematic exposition\nof his epistemology or his ideas about social structure, history, and\nhuman nature, all of which were necessary for Marxist\nphilosophy\u2019s consistent and continuing existence.\n\nMany interpreters of Marx, and not just those Althusser directly\nengaged with during the early 1960s, have maintained that such texts\nas the 1859 Preface and the 1844 Manuscripts provide\nkeys to understanding Marx\u2019s philosophy. However, Althusser made\nthe case that these texts were contradictory and insufficient for this\npurpose. It is with this contention that the models provided by\npsychoanalysis and by Marx\u2019s own critique of classical political\neconomy come to inform Althusser\u2019s overall hermeneutic strategy.\nPart of this strategy, Althusser maintains, is directly taken from\nMarx\u2019s own method. Thus, in a way parallel to Marx pointing out\nin Capital V.II (1885) that Adam Smith needed the concept of\nthe \u201cvalue of labor\u201d for his explanations of capitalist\neconomic activity but could not fully generate it out of the systems\nof ideas available to him, Althusser argued that, though Marx was\nrecognizably engaged in the work of Historical Materialism in\nCapital, the philosophical theory or background conceptual\nframework that allowed this investigation to proceed was not fully\narticulated.\n\nThe explicit project of Reading Capital and of many of the\nessays included in For Marx was to make these fundamental\nconcepts explicit. It was to do so by paying attention to the\ntheoretical \u201cproblematic,\u201d or background ideological\nframework in which the work was generated, by analyzing those passages\nwhere a philosophical concept had to have been in use but was not made\nexplicit, and by noting and explaining where and why one theoretical\npronouncement is in contradiction with itself or with another passage.\nFor Althusser, such areas of Marx\u2019s text are\n\u201csymptoms,\u201d in the psychoanalytic sense of the word, of\nthe necessary but unarticulated philosophical framework that\nunderwrites and allows his scientific investigations. Of these\nframeworks, Marx was not fully conscious. However, they were what\nallowed him to investigate and describe such socio-economic events as\nthe transformation of money into capital without recourse to Hegelian\nlogic and concepts. Althusser argues that by paying attention to these\npassages in Marx\u2019s text as well as by seeking out Marxist\nconcepts as these were developed during the course of practical\nMarxist activity by theorists such as Lenin and Mao, an attentive\nreader can render explicit Marx\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThat the concepts Althusser derived from his symptomatic reading of\nMarx, Lenin, and Mao were Marxist concepts was avowed. Nevertheless,\nAlthusser also acknowledged that some of the concepts found latent in\nthese texts were derived from and consistent with his philosophical\nand social scientific contemporaries as well as with those of Spinoza.\nOf course, this is not inconsistent with the theory of reading and\nauthorship that underwrites a symptomatic reading of a text. Inasmuch\nas authors and readers are always said to think with concepts borrowed\nfrom or supplied by the problematic that they inhabit, there is no\nsuch thing as an innocent or objective reading: we understand things\nwith and through the concepts available to us. Perhaps nowhere is this\nborrowing more evident than in Althusser\u2019s ideas about how\nscientific and philosophic knowledge is generated. Though Althusser is\nvery careful to back up his arguments about Marx\u2019s epistemology\nwith close analyses of Marx\u2019s work, it is apparent that the\nmodel for knowledge acquisition that is developed in Reading\nCapital owes much to Spinoza and to the French tradition of\nhistorical epistemology.\n",
