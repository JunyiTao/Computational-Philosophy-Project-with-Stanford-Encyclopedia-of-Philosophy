    "main_text": "Logic || The philosophy of logic and mathematics\n3.6 The philosophy of logic and mathematics\n\nThere was no official philosophy of logic and mathematics in the LWS.\nMost Polish logicians treated logical studies as independent of\nphilosophical commitments. Only Le\u015bniewski had explicit\nphilosophical views which influenced the form of his systems. This\ndoes not mean that concrete works were not influenced by philosophical\nideas. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s many-valued logic and Tarski\u2019s\ntheory of truth are perhaps model cases. The former had the problem of\ndeterminism as its background and the second was strongly inspired by\nthe Aristotelian tradition in thinking about truth. It was also the\ncase that Polish logicians had inclinations to empiricism as a general\nepistemological attitude and this philosophy often resulted in\nsympathies to nominalism (Tarski), constructivism (Mostowski) and\nscepticism concerning the sharp distinction between logical and\nextralogical truth (Tarski). However, the technical side of logical\nproblems decided about investigations and sometimes forced changes in\nphilosophical standpoints. The example of \u0141ukasiewicz is\ninstructive once again. Although he at first thought of logic as a\ntrue or false description of reality, he later adopted a more\nconventionalist and instrumentalistic standpoint. This attitude\nallowed him to accommodate various ideas coming from rival\nfoundational directions, that is, logicism, formalism and\nintuitionism. In fact, Le\u015bniewski and Tarski contributed to the\ntheory of logical types and combined it with the theory of syntactic\ncategories; Tarski\u2019s version in his work on truth is\nparticularly important. Tarski also showed new perspectives for\nlogicism by defining logical concepts as invariants under one-to-one\ntransformations. He also contributed to general metamathematics (the\ntheory of consequence operation) and intuitionistic logic. However, a\nvery special feature of logical investigations performed in the LWS\nconsisted in the free admission of all fruitful mathematical methods,\nincluding non-constructive ones. This was the main point of the set\ntheoretical approach to the foundations of mathematics which replaced\nlogicism.\n",
