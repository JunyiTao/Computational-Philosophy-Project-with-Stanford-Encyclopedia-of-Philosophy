    "main_text": "Motivations || Ellsberg decisions\n2.1 Ellsberg decisions\nThere are a number of examples of decision problems where we are\nintuitively drawn to go against the prescriptions of precise\nprobabilism. And indeed, many experimental subjects do seem to express\npreferences that violate the axioms. IP offers a way of representing\nthese intuitively plausible and experimentally observed choices as\nrational. One classic example of this is the Ellsberg\nproblem (Ellsberg 1961).\n\nI have an urn that contains ninety marbles. Thirty marbles are\nred. The remainder are blue or yellow in some unknown proportion.\n\nConsider the indicator gambles for various events in this\nscenario. Consider a choice between a bet that wins if the marble\ndrawn is red (I), versus a bet that wins if the marble drawn is blue\n(II). You might prefer I to II since I involves risk while II\ninvolves ambiguity. A prospect is risky if its outcome is\nuncertain but its outcomes occur with known probability. A prospect is\nambiguous if the outcomes occur with unknown or only partially known\nprobabilities. Now consider a choice between a bet that wins if the\nmarble drawn is not blue (III) versus a bet that wins if the marble\ndrawn is not red (IV). Now it is III that is ambiguous, while IV is\nunambiguous but risky, and thus IV might seem better to you if you\npreferred risky to ambiguous prospects. Such a pattern of preferences\n(I preferred to II but IV preferred to III) cannot be rationalised as\nthe choices of a precise expected utility maximiser. The gambles are\nsummarised in the table.\n\n\n\n\nR\nB\nY\n\n\nI\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nII\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nIII\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nIV\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nTable 1: The Ellsberg bets. The urn\ncontains 30 red marbles and 60 blue/yellow marbles\n\nLet the probabilities for red, blue and yellow marbles\nbe \\(r\\), \\(b\\)\nand \\(y\\) respectively. If you were an\nexpected utility maximiser and preferred I to II,\nthen \\(r > b\\) and a preference for IV over\nIII entails that \\(r+y < y +b\\). No numbers\ncan jointly satisfy these two constraints. Therefore, no probability\nfunction is such that an expected utility maximiser with that\nprobability would choose in the way described above. While by no means\nuniversal, these preferences are a robust feature of many experimental\nsubjects\u2019 response to this sort of\nexample (Camerer and Weber 1992; Fox and\nTversky 1995). Some experiments suggest that Ellsberg-type patterns of preference are rarer than normally recognised (Binmore et al. 2012; Voorhoeve et al. 2016). For more on ambiguity attitudes, see Trautmann and van der Kuilen (2016).\nThe imprecise probabilist can model the situation as\nfollows: \\(P(R)=1/3, P(B)=P(Y)=[0,2/3]\\). Note\nthat this expression of the belief state misses out some important\ndetails. For example, for all \\(p\\in P\\), we\nhave \\(p(B)=2/3-p(Y)\\). For the point being made\nhere, this detail is not important. Modelling the ambiguity\nallows us to rationalise real agents\u2019 preferences for bets on red. To\nflesh this story out would require a lot more to be said about\ndecision making, (see section 3.3) but the\nintuition is that aversion to ambiguity explains the preference for I\nover II and IV over III.\nAs Steele (2007) points out, the\nabove analysis rationalises the Ellsberg choices only if we are\ndealing with genuinely indeterminate or unspecific beliefs. If we were\ndealing with a case of imperfectly introspected belief then there\nwould exist some \\(p\\) in the representor such\nthat rational choices maximise \\(E_{p}\\). For\nthe Ellsberg choices, there is no\nsuch \\(p\\).\nThis view on the lessons of the Ellsberg game is not\nuncontroversial. Al-Najjar and Weinstein\n(2009) offer an alternative view on the interpretation of the\nEllsberg preferences. Their view is that the distinctive pattern of\nEllsberg choices is due to agents applying certain heuristics to solve\nthe decisions that assume that the odds are manipulable. In real-life\nsituations, if someone offers you a bet, you might think that they\nmust have some advantage over you in order for it to be worth their\nwhile offering you the bet. Such scepticism, appropriately modelled,\ncan yield the Ellsberg choices within a simple game theoretic precise\nprobabilistic model.\n",
