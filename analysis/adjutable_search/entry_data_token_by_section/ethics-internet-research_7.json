    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Big Data Considerations\n4.5 Big Data Considerations\n\nAlgorithmic processing is a corollary of big data research, and\nnewfound ethical considerations have emerged. From \u201calgorithmic\nharms\u201d to \u201cpredictive analytics\u201d, the power of\ntoday\u2019s algorithms exceeds long-standing privacy beliefs and\nnorms. Specifically, the National Science and Technology Council\nnote:\n\n\u201cAnalytical algorithms\u201d as algorithms for prioritizing,\nclassifying, filtering, and predicting. Their use can create privacy\nissues when the information used by algorithms is inappropriate or\ninaccurate, when incorrect decisions occur, when there is no\nreasonable means of redress, when an individual\u2019s autonomy is\ndirectly related to algorithmic scoring, or when the use of predictive\nalgorithms chills desirable behavior or encourages other privacy\nharms. (NSTC 2016: 18).\n\n\nWhile the concept of big data is not new, and the term has been in\ntechnical discourses since the 1990s, public awareness and response to\nbig data research is much more recent. Following the rise of social\nmedia-based research, Buchanan (2016) has delineated the emergence of\n\u201cbig data\u201d-based research from 2012 to the present, with\nno signs of an endpoint.\n\nBig data research is challenging for research ethics boards, often\npresenting what the computer ethicist James Moor would call\n\u201cconceptual muddles\u201d: the inability to properly\nconceptualize the ethical values and dilemmas at play in a new\ntechnological context. Subject privacy, for example, is typically\nprotected within the context of research ethics through a combination\nof various tactics and practices, including engaging in data\ncollection under controlled or anonymous environments, limiting the\npersonal information gathered, scrubbing data to remove or obscure\npersonally identifiable information, and using access restrictions and\nrelated data security methods to prevent unauthorized access and use\nof the research data itself. The nature and understanding of privacy\nbecome muddled, however, in the context of big data research, and as a\nresult, ensuring it is respected and protected in this new domain\nbecomes challenging.\n\nFor example, the determination of what constitutes \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d\u2014and thus triggering particular privacy\nconcerns\u2014becomes difficult within the context of big data\nresearch. Distinctions within the regulatory definition of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d\u2014namely, that it only applies\nto information which subjects reasonably expect is not normally\nmonitored or collected and not normally publicly\navailable\u2014become less clearly applicable when considering the\ndata environments and collection practices that typify big data\nresearch, such as the wholesale scraping of Facebook news feed content\nor public OKCupid accounts.\n\nWhen considered through the lens of the regulatory definition of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d, social media postings are often\nconsidered public, especially when users take no visible, affirmative\nsteps to restrict access. As a result, big data researchers might\nconclude subjects are not deserving of particular privacy\nconsideration. Yet, the social media platforms frequently used for big\ndata research purposes represent a complex environment of\nsocio-technical interactions, where users often fail to understand\nfully how their social activities might be regularly monitored,\nharvested, and shared with third parties, where privacy policies and\nterms of service are not fully understood and change frequently, and\nwhere the technical infrastructures and interfaces are designed to\nmake restricting information flows and protecting one\u2019s privacy\ndifficult.\n\nAs noted\n in \u00a74.1 above\n it becomes difficult to confirm a user\u2019s intention when sharing\ninformation on a social media platform, and whether users recognize\nthat providing information in a social environment also opens it up\nfor widespread harvesting and use by researchers. This uncertainty in\nthe intent and expectations of users of social media and\ninternet-based platforms\u2014often fueled by the design of the\nplatforms themselves\u2014create numerous conceptual muddles in our\nability to properly alleviate potential privacy concerns in big data\nresearch.\n\nThe conceptual gaps that exist regarding privacy and the definition of\npersonally identifiable information in the context of big data\nresearch inevitably lead to similar gaps regarding when informed\nconsent is necessary. Researchers mining Facebook profile information\nor public Twitter streams, for example, typically argue that no\nspecific consent is necessary due to the fact the information was\npublicly available. It remains unknown whether users truly understood\nthe technical conditions under which they made information visible on\nthese social media platforms or if they foresaw their data being\nharvested for research purposes, rather than just appearing onscreen\nfor fleeting glimpses by their friends and followers (Fiesler &\nProferes, 2018). In the case of the Facebook emotional contagion\nexperiment (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock 2014), the lack of\nobtaining consent was initially rationalized through the notion that\nthe research appeared to have been carried out under Facebook\u2019s\nextensive terms of service, whose data use policy, while more than\n9,000 words long, does make passing mention to \u201cresearch\u201d.\nIt was later revealed, however, that the data use policy in effect\nwhen the experiment was conducted never mentioned\n\u201cresearch\u201d at all (Hill 2014).\n\nAdditional ethical concerns have arisen surrounding the large scale\ndata collection practices connected to machine learning and the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence. For example, negative public\nattention have surrounded algorithms designed to infer sexual\norientation from photographs and facial recognition algorithms trained\non videos of transgender people. In both cases, ethical concerns have\nbeen raised about both the purpose of these algorithms and the fact\nthat the data that trained them (dating profile photos and YouTube\nvideos, respectively) was \u201cpublic\u201d but collected from\npotentially vulnerable populations without consent (Metcalf 2017;\nKeyes 2019). While those building AI systems cannot always control the\nconditions under which the data they utilize is collected, their\nincreased use of big datasets captured from social media or related\nsources raises a number of concerns beyond what typically is\nconsidered part of the growing focus on AI ethics: fairness,\naccountability and transparency in AI can only be fully possible when\ndata collection is achieved in a fair, ethical, and just manner (Stahl\n& Wright 2018; Kerry 2020).\n",
