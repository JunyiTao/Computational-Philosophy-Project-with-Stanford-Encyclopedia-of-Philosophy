    "preamble": "\n\nRobert Nozick (1938\u20132002) was a renowned American philosopher\nwho first came to be widely known through his 1974 book, Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia\n (1974),[1]\n which won the National Book Award for Philosophy and Religion in\n1975. Pressing further the anti-consequentialist aspects of John\nRawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice, Nozick argued that respect\nfor individual rights is the key standard for assessing state action\nand, hence, that the only legitimate state is a minimal state that\nrestricts its activities to the protection of the rights of life,\nliberty, property, and contract. Despite his highly acclaimed work in\nmany other fields of philosophy, Nozick remained best known for the\nlibertarian doctrine advanced in Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Nozick\u2019s Life and Times\n\nRobert Nozick was born in Brooklyn in 1938 to a Russian Jewish\nimmigrant family. He earned an undergraduate Philosophy degree from\nColumbia University in 1959 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton\nUniversity in 1963. He taught for a couple of years at Princeton,\nHarvard, and Rockefeller Universities before moving permanently to\nHarvard in 1969. He became widely known through his 1974 book,\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia, which shocked the philosophical\nworld with its robust and sophisticated defense of the minimal\nstate\u2014the state that restricts its activities to the protection\nof individual rights of life, liberty, property, and contract and\neschews the use of state power to redistribute income, to make people\nmoral, or to protect people from harming themselves. Nozick went on to\npublish important works that ranged over metaphysics, epistemology,\nthe philosophy of science, and axiology\u2014Philosophical\nExplanations (1981), The Examined Life (1989), The\nNature of Rationality (1993), Socratic Puzzles (1997),\nand Invariances (2001). Nozick\u2019s always lively,\nengaging, audacious, and philosophically ambitious writings revealed\nan amazing knowledge of advanced work in many disciplines including\ndecision theory, economics, mathematics, physics, psychology, and\nreligion. Robert Nozick died in 2002 from stomach cancer for which he\nwas first treated in 1994.\n\nAs an undergraduate student at Columbia and at least in his early days\nas a graduate student at Princeton, Nozick endorsed socialism. At\nColumbia, he was a founder of what was to become the local chapter of\nStudents for a Democratic Society. The major force in his conversion\nto libertarian views was his conversations at Princeton with his\nfellow philosophy graduate student, Bruce Goldberg. It was through\nGoldberg that Nozick met the economist Murray Rothbard who was the\nmajor champion of \u201cindividualist anarchism\u201d in the later\ndecades of the twentieth century (Raico 2002, Other Internet\nResources). Nozick\u2019s encounter with Rothbard and\nRothbard\u2019s rights-based critique of the state (Rothbard 1973 and\n1978)\u2014including the minimal state\u2014lead Nozick to the\nproject of formulating a rights-based libertarianism that would\nvindicate the minimal state. There is, however, an intriguing lacuna\nin this story. Goldberg himself and the economists whose writings are\noften said to have influenced Nozick\u2019s conversion to\nlibertarianism\u2014F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman\u2014were not at\nall friends of natural rights theory. So, we have no account of why\nthe libertarianism that Nozick himself adopted came in the form of\nnatural rights theory (and an associated doctrine of acquired property\nrights).\n\nThis account of the political philosophy of Robert Nozick is\nfundamentally an account of the rights-oriented libertarian doctrine\nthat Nozick presents in Anarchy, State, and Utopia. That\ndoctrine is the Nozickean\n doctrine.[2]\n Nozick never attempted to further develop the views that he expressed\nin\n ASU,[3]\n and he never responded to the extensive critical reaction to those\nviews. Nozick did seem to repudiate at least some aspects of the\nASU doctrine in The Examined Life and The Nature\nof Rationality (Nozick 1989: 286\u2013296). Nozick\u2019s real\nor apparent repudiation in these works turned on his doctrine of\nsymbolic utility which cannot be examined\n here.[4]\n At later yet points in his life Nozick downplayed his apparent\nrepudiation of political\n libertarianism.[5]\n In a 2001 interview, he said:\n\n\n\u2026 the rumors of my deviation (or apostasy!) from libertarianism\nwere much exaggerated. I think [Invariances] makes clear the\nextent to which I still am within the general framework of\nlibertarianism, especially the ethics chapter and its section on the\n\u201cCore Principle of Ethics\u201d. (Sanchez 2001, Other Internet\nResources)\n\n\nAccording to that chapter, there are a number of layers of ethics. The\nfirst of these is the ethics of respect which consists of a set of\nnegative rights. This layer and only this layer may be made mandatory\nin any society. \u201cAll that any society should (coercively) demand\nis adherence to the ethics of respect\u201d (Nozick 2001: 282).\n\nThere are four main topics that most deserve discussion with respect\nto Anarchy, State, and Utopia. They are: (1) the underpinning\n(if any) and the character and robustness of the moral rights that\nconstitute the basic normative framework for most of Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia; (2) the character and degree of success of\nNozick\u2019s defense of the minimal state against the charge by the\nindividualist anarchist that \u201cthe state itself is intrinsically\nimmoral\u201d (ASU 51); (3) Nozick\u2019s articulation and\ndefense of his historical entitlement doctrine of justice in holdings\nand his associated critique of end-state and patterned doctrines of\ndistributive justice, especially John Rawls\u2019 difference\nprinciple (as defended in A Theory of Justice); and (4)\nNozick\u2019s argument that utopian aspirations provide a\ncomplementary route to the vindication of the minimal state. Our\ndiscussion of the first two topics focuses on Part I of ASU,\nentitled \u201cState-of-Nature Theory or How to Back into a State\nwithout Really Trying\u201d. Our investigation of the third topic,\nthe historical entitlement doctrine of just holdings and competing\nconceptions of distributive justice, focuses on chapter 7,\n\u201cDistributive Justice\u201d of Part II of ASU,\n\u201cBeyond the Minimal State?\u201d Our discussion of the fourth\ntopic, the utopian route to the minimal state, focuses on chapter 10,\n\u201cA Framework for Utopia\u201d, which is the whole of Part III\nof ASU, \u201cUtopia\u201d. Focusing on these four core\ntopics leaves aside many of Nozick\u2019s rich and intriguing side\ndiscussions.\n2. Moral Rights and Side-Constraints\n\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia opens with the famously bold claim\nthat \u201cIndividuals have rights, and there are things no person or\ngroup may do to them (without violating their rights)\u201d (ix).\n2.1 State of Nature Rights\n\nThese moral rights are understood as state of nature rights. That is,\nthey are rights that precede and provide a basis for assessing and\nconstraining not only the actions of individuals and groups but also\nthe conduct of political and legal institutions. These rights also\nprecede any social contract; they morally constrain the conduct of\nindividuals, groups, and institutions even in the absence of any\nsocial contract. In Locke\u2019s language, these rights constitute a\nlaw of nature\u2014or an especially important part of a law of\nnature\u2014that governs the pre-political and pre-contractual state\nof nature (Locke 1690: Second Treatise \u00a76).\n\nMoreover, to possess such a right is not merely to be in some\ncondition the promotion or maintenance of which is socially expedient.\nPart of the message of that opening proclamation is that there are\ncertain things that may not be done to individuals even if, by some\nstandard, they are socially optimizing. The rights that individuals\nhave are moral bulwarks against behavior that promotes even the most\nradiant\u2014or apparently radiant\u2014social end. In addition,\nthese state of nature moral rights are taken to be negative. They\nspecify types of conduct that may not be done to individuals rather\nthan types of conduct that must be done for people.\n\nFinally, since these rights are not granted by institutions, created\nby any contractual process, or accorded to individuals for the sake of\nadvancing some optimal social outcome, if they have any foundation,\nthat foundation must consist in some morally impressive fact about the\nnature of individuals qua individuals. Some morally\nimpressive fact about the nature of individuals\u2014e.g., that they\neach have ends or projects of their own to which they rationally\ndevote themselves\u2014must provide others with reason to not treat\nthem certain ways, e.g., as beings who ought to serve the ends of\nothers. We shall see that Nozick advances a claim of this sort in his\naccount of why agents should abide by moral side-constraints in their\nconduct toward others.\n\nRecourse to the familiar distinction between claim-rights and\nliberty-rights will enable us to be somewhat more precise about the\nstate of nature rights that Nozick ascribes to each individual.\nLiberty-rights are absences of obligations. You have a liberty-right\nto scratch your nose as long as you have no obligation not to.\nClaim-rights are moral (and enforceable) claims against others to\ntheir acting or not acting in certain ways. You have a claim-right\nagainst others not to be interfered with in the scratching of your\nnose if and only if others have an (enforceable) obligation\nnot to interfere with you in this way. Standardly, when we speak of\nrights we are speaking of composites of liberty-rights and\nclaim-rights. For instance, standardly, your right to scratch your\nnose consists in your having no obligation not to do so and others\nhaving (enforceable) obligations not to interfere with your doing so.\nYour moral liberty to scratch your nose is morally protected by your\n(enforceable) claim against others that they not interfere with your\ndoing so.\n\nWhen Nozick asserts that individuals possess pre-political,\npre-contractual moral rights against certain things being done to\nthem\u2014even for the sake of ends that are or purport to be\nsocially optimal\u2014he is most obviously ascribing claim-rights to\nindividuals correlative to which are pre-political and pre-contractual\nmoral obligations of each agent not to do certain\nthings to other individuals. Since, all state of nature obligations\n(that are rights-correlative and, hence, enforceable) are negative, in\nthe state of nature individuals are morally at liberty to engage in\nany conduct that does not transgress others\u2019 state of\nnature claim-rights. Thus, Nozick\u2019s opening proclamation of\nrights affirms for each individual extensive\nliberty-rights\u2014extensive freedom from obligations, especially\npositive obligations\u2014that are systematically protected against\ninterference by moral claim-rights. It needs to be mentioned that\nthese moral rights are taken to be people\u2019s baseline rights;\nthey are rights that are subject to contraction or expansion through\nan individual\u2019s actions and interactions. So, e.g., although\neach individual has a natural right against all others not to be\nstruck in her nose, each may waive that right by agreeing to take\nplace in a boxing match, and each may acquire a liberty-right to\nstrike the other party to the boxing contract.\n2.2 The Foundation of Rights\n\nIt is a commonplace to say that in ASU Nozick provides no\nfoundation for his affirmation of such Lockean natural rights (Nagel\n1975). And, not many pages after Nozick proclaims these rights, he\nhimself points out that his book provides no \u201cprecise theory of\nthe moral basis of individual rights\u201d (xiv). Nevertheless,\nNozick does have important things to say about the underpinning of\nthese rights and about their deontic character and their stringency.\nIndeed, it is striking that, when Nozick seeks to motivate his opening\naffirmation of rights, he starts with the same understanding and\ncritique of utilitarianism that Rawls offers in A Theory of\nJustice when Rawls begins to motivate his contractarian doctrine.\nWhat separates Nozick from Rawls at this very basic level is a\ndifference in their construal of the implications of this common\ncritique. Nozick may, in this way, offer as much of a foundation for\nadopting his natural rights stance as Rawls offers in A Theory of\nJustice for adopting his contractarian stance.\n\nAs is well known, Rawls starts by ascribing to the utilitarian the\nclaim that the rationality of a certain principle of social choice can\nbe inferred from the rationality of a certain principle of individual\nchoice. The principle of individual choice is that, at least if no\nother party is affected, it is rational for an individual to incur\ncosts for herself (or to forego benefits for herself) if doing so will\nspare her greater costs (or provide her with greater benefits).\nAccording to Rawls, the utilitarian holds that by parity of reasoning\nit is rational for a member of society to incur costs for herself (or\nto forego benefits for herself) if doing so will spare any\nmember of society greater costs (or provide any member of\nsociety with greater benefits). This is the purported rational\nprinciple of social choice. Thus, we get to the utilitarian conclusion\nthat each agent as a member of society has reason to maximize the\naggregate social good even at the expense of the individual good of\nherself (or others).\n\nAs is also well-known, Rawls rejects this reasoning on the grounds\nthat it does not take seriously the separateness and distinctness of\npersons. Persons are markedly more separate and distinct from one\nanother than are the different phases or time-slices of a given\nperson\u2019s life. Because of this, one cannot proceed from its\nbeing worthwhile for a given person to incur costs for herself in\norder to spare herself greater costs to its being worthwhile for a\ngiven person as a member of society to incur costs for herself in\norder to spare any member of society greater costs. According to\nRawls, only if we conflate individuals\u2014only if we mistakenly\nconceive of them as parts of a single person-like being, will the\nutilitarian principle of social choice be on a par with the principle\nof individual choice (Rawls 1971: 26\u20137).\n\nRawls summarizes his primary case against utilitarianism by\nsaying,\n\n\n\u2026 if we assume that the correct regulative principle for\nanything depends on the nature of that thing, and the plurality of\ndistinct persons with separate systems of ends is an essential feature\nof human societies, we should not expect the principles of social\nchoice to be utilitarian. (Rawls 1971: 29)\n\n\nThis summation goes well beyond the dismissal of the utilitarian\nregulative principle. For it strongly suggests a criterion for\nidentifying the correct regulative principle (or set of principles)\nfor the governance of social interaction. Such regulative principles\nmust differ significantly from the utilitarian principle by being\nresponsive to or reflective of the plurality of distinct persons with\nseparate systems of ends. We should note here that what is crucial is\nnot the bare normatively neutral fact that individuals have separate\nsystems of ends but, rather that individuals rationally seek to\npromote their own ends. It is the rational propriety of each\nperson\u2019s pursuit her own good that basic regulative principles\nneed to be responsive to or reflect. Rawls then offers his crucial\ncontractarian construal of how regulative principles qualify as being\nresponsive to or reflective of the plurality of persons. According to\nRawls, they so qualify by being principles that all individuals\nconcerned with the promotion of their own systems of ends would agree\nto under circumstances suitable for such agreement.\n\nIt is striking that Nozick proceeds through a highly similar critical\ntreatment of utilitarianism when he asks why persons may not be\nviolated for the greater social good.\n\n\nIndividually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or\nsacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm\u2026 In\neach case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall\ngood. Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some\ncosts that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall\nsocial good? (ASU 32)\n\n\nNozick\u2019s response to this question is,\n\n\nBut there is no social entity with a good that undergoes some\nsacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people,\ndifferent individual people, with their own individual lives. Using\none of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits\nthe others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to\nhim for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this\nup. (32\u20133)\n\n\nHere Nozick makes things too easy for himself by ascribing to the\nutilitarian a belief in a social entity\u2014as Rawls makes things\ntoo easy for himself by saying that the utilitarian argument depends\non fusing or conflating persons. For the utilitarian may simply hold\nthat the best explanation for the rationality of a given person\nincurring some cost for herself in order to avoid some greater cost\nfor herself is the unrestricted rationality of minimizing net costs\n(or maximizing net benefits). According to this utilitarian, we do not\nhave to move from the principle of individual choice to the principle\nof social choice. For, we start with the unrestricted rationality of\nminimizing costs (or maximizing benefits); and the principle of\nindividual choice is simply the application of that principle of\nsocial choice to the special case in which there is only one agent who\nis also the one subject of benefits and costs.\n\nTo counter the contention that, at the outset, practical rationality\ncalls for the minimization of net costs (or the maximization of net\nbenefits), Rawls and Nozick need to hold that what makes it\npractically rational for a given individual to incur some cost to\nherself (or forego some benefit for herself) is the\navoidance of some greater cost to herself (or the attainment\nof some greater benefit for herself). They need to hold that\n(at least absent further argument) the rational balancing of costs\nincurred (or benefits foregone) and costs avoided (or benefits\nattained) must take place within lives and not\nacross lives. And this does seem to be part of the intended force\nof Rawls\u2019 invocation of a \u201cplurality of distinct persons\nwith separate systems of\n ends\u201d[6]\n and of Nozick\u2019s insistence that there are \u201conly\nindividual people, different individual people, with their own\nindividual lives\u201d (33). In Nozick this stance is most explicit\nwhen he parses \u201cthe fact of our separate existences\u201d\nas,\n\n\n\u2026 the fact that no moral balancing act can take place among us;\nthere is no moral outweighing of one of our lives by others so as to\nlead to a great overall social good. There is no justified sacrifice\nof some of us for others. (33)\n\n\nNote, however, that this last sentence is ambiguous. It may mean\nsimply that there is no moral balancing across individuals that\nrequires individuals to sacrifice for others or that justifies others\nin imposing such sacrifices. However, that sentence may also mean that\n\u201cno one may be sacrificed for others\u201d (33) in the sense\nthat those who impose such sacrifices wrong the individuals\nwho are subjected to those losses. That is, it may also mean that\nthere is (in Rawls\u2019 terminology) a \u201ccorrect regulative\nprinciple\u201d that forbids and condemns the imposition of such\nsacrifices. It is clear that Nozick intends to assert this further\nclaim even though he does not explicitly recognize that it is a\nfurther and distinct proposition. For, according to Nozick, one will\nnot \u201csufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he\n[i.e., any given individual] is a separate person, that his is the\nonly life he has\u201d (33) unless one morally condemns and eschews\nuses of that person\u2014in particular, impositions of losses on that\nperson for the sake of (what purports to be) the social good.\n\nThe \u201cfact of our separate existences\u201d is \u201cthe fact\nthat that no moral balancing act can take place among us\u201d\n(because costs and benefits add up within persons\u2019 lives and not\nacross them). In contrast, the further fact that there are moral\nside-constraints against imposing sacrifices on some to serve the\ninterests of others is a reflection of the \u201cfact of our\nseparate existences\u201d. We come to the affirmation of those\nside-constraints when we sufficiently respect and take account of the\nseparateness of\n persons.[7]\n This is what Nozick must mean when he says that \u201cThe moral side\nconstraints upon what we may do\u2026 reflect the fact of our\nseparate existences\u201d (33). The fact of our separate\nexistences\u2014as Nozick parses that fact\u2014is the morally\nimpressive fact about the nature of individuals that provides us with\nreason to be circumspect in our conduct toward one another. We respect\nor honor others as agents with rational ends of their own not by\npromoting their ends as we do our own but, rather, by not sacrificing\nthem to our ends.\n\nIf correct regulative principles for social interaction must\nsufficiently respect and take account of the plurality of distinct\npersons with separate systems of ends, those regulative principles\nmust not treat persons as means for the attainment of any (putatively)\nchoice-worthy social outcome. Regulative principles that endorse the\nuse of persons for the sake of (purportedly) choice-worthy social\noutcomes\u2014e.g., the social outcome of there being a choice-worthy\ndistribution of goods among individuals\u2014too much resemble the\nutilitarian regulative principle. They share the failure of the\nutilitarian principle to sufficiently respect and take account of the\nplurality of distinct persons with separate systems of ends. Thus,\nNozick contends, correct regulative principles must take the form of\nmoral side constraints upon what may be done to individuals even for\nthe sake of really valuable, choice-worthy social outcomes. Rawls\nreads the willingness of utilitarianism to impose losses on\nindividuals for the sake of the aggregate good as a mark of\nutilitarianism\u2019s failure to recognize the status of individuals\nas ends-in-themselves and not merely means to the ends of others.\nNozick follows suit in appropriating this Kantian language (see Cohen\n1995: 238\u2013243). But, contrary to Rawls, Nozick maintains that\nthe endorsement of the imposition of sacrifices on individuals for the\nsake of any (non-trivial) conception of the social\ngood\u2014even, e.g., distribution-sensitive conceptions of the\nsocial good\u2014fails to recognize the status of individuals as\n ends-in-themselves.[8]\n\nSo, Nozick offers very much the same type of argument for the\nexistence of some correct regulative principle for social\ninteraction as Rawls does in A Theory of Justice. The\ndifference is that Nozick does not hold that the mark of principles\nbeing responsive to or reflective of the fact of our separate\nexistences is that they would be agreed to by everyone under suitable\nagreement circumstances. Rather, he supposes that we can identify\ntypes of treatment of persons as not sufficiently respecting and\ntaking account of the rationality of individuals pursuing of their own\ngood without having to appeal to any actual or hypothetical agreement.\nIn particular, the imposition of sacrifices upon individuals does not\nsufficiently take account of their being agents who rationally pursue\ntheir own systems of ends. The key \u201cmoral content gotten by this\nargument which focuses upon the fact that there are distinct\nindividuals each with his own life to lead\u201d is that\n\u201csacrificing one person to benefit another\u201d is morally\nprohibited (34).\n2.3 Rights as Side Constraints\n\nFor Nozick, a paradigmatic natural moral right is the right not to be\nsubjected to (unprovoked) killing. Correlative to this right is the\nmoral side constraint to which all individuals are naturally subject\nnot to engage in the (unprovoked) killing of others. As Nozick\nunderstands this right, it forbids A\u2019s (unprovoked)\nkilling of B even if A can prevent W from\nkilling X, Y, and Z only by killing\nB. Although it may in some sense be less\nbad for B to be killed than for X, Y,\nand Z to be killed, A remains bound not to kill\nB. A may not prevent the wrong that W will\ndo in killing X, Y, and Z by killing\nB. For Nozick, rights express the moral inviolability of\nindividuals; and B would not be morally inviolable\u2014nor\nwould any of us be\u2014were B open to use by A\neven for the purpose of preventing the violation of the rights of\nX, Y, and Z. Not even the minimization of\nthe violation of the right against being killed can justify the\nviolation of that right.\n\nAccording to Nozick, our core reason for abstaining from murder is not\nthat abstention advances the goal of minimizing murders. Indeed, if\nthat were our reason to eschew murder, A should not eschew\nmurdering B if that is the only way that he can prevent\nW from murdering X, Y, and Z.\nRather, Nozick\u2019s deontological claim is that the status that\neach individual has as an end-in-himself morally constrains each other\nagent\u2019s conduct toward those individuals. Both A and\nW are morally precluded from the (unprovoked) killing of\nB, X, Y, and Z (and of each\nother). W triply violates this side constraint when he kills\nX, Y, and Z; but A abides\nby this constraint only if he abstains from killing\nB\u2014even if A\u2019s killing of B\nwould (somehow) prevent W\u2019s killing of X,\nY, and Z.\n\nIt is often thought that there is something paradoxical about\ndeontological propositions like the assertion that everyone is bound\nto abstain from the (unprovoked) killing of\n others.[9]\n This thought rests on two standard consequentialist ideas. The first\nis that the wrongness of a given sort of action\u2014e.g.,\n(unprovoked) killing\u2014must derive from the badness of the\n(typical) consequences of actions of that sort. The second is that the\nbadness of the consequences of multiple actions of a given sort can be\naggregated so that (typically) the total badness of the results of a\nbunch of wrongful actions of that sort will be greater than the\nbadness of the results of one action of that sort. For example, the\ntotal badness associated with W\u2019s (unprovoked) killings\nof X, Y, and Z will (typically) be greater\nthan the badness associated with A\u2019s (unprovoked)\nkilling of B. It follows that it will (typically) be wrong\nfor A to abstain from killing B if that is the only\nway to prevent W\u2019s (unprovoked) killings of X,\nY, and Z. The supposed paradox is that the\nwrongfulness of (unprovoked) killing must rest on the badness of the\n(typical) results of such killings; but recourse to the badness of\nresults in the assessment of actions (typically) leads to the\nendorsement of (unprovoked) killings in precisely those cases in which\nthe advocate of deontic constraints wants to insist upon their\nwrongfulness. However, the construction of this paradox of deontology\nrests firmly upon ideas that, as we have seen, Nozick has rejected on\nhis way to asserting deontic side constraints.\n\nNozick also provides a further and seemingly more conventional\ndiscussion of the bases for moral constraints in which various lofty\ncapacities that human beings (usually) possess or are thought to\npossess are cited. He mentions being\n\n\n[S]entient and self-conscious; rational (capable of using abstract\nconcepts, not tied to responses to immediate stimuli); possessing free\nwill; being a moral agent capable of guiding its behavior by moral\nprinciples and capable of engaging in mutual limitation of conduct;\nhaving a soul. (48)\n\n\nTo these he adds \u201cthe ability to regulate and guide its life in\naccordance with some overall conception it chooses to accept\u201d\n(49). But, does the presence of these non-moral features underwrite\nmoral constraints against preventing individuals from exercising these\ncapacities in their own chosen ways? Nozick seeks to bolster the\nsignificance of these features by contending that a person can give\nmeaning to his life only by exercising these capacities in accordance\nwith some overall plan of his own (50). The suggestion is that it is\nnot meaningfulness at large that is crucial for each individual but,\nrather the meaningfulness for him of the life that arises through his\nexercise of an overall plan for his\n life.[10]\n However, Nozick then asks\n\n\nwhy not replace \u2018happiness\u2019 with\n\u2018meaningfulness\u2019 within utilitarian theory, and maximize\nthe total \u2018meaningfulness\u2019 score of the persons in the\nworld? (50)\n\n\nThis is surprising. For one would expect that, in accord with his\nseparateness of persons argument, Nozick would say that the import of\neach individual having a meaningful life as his end is not a\nutilitarianism of meaningful lives but, rather, side constraints on\ninterference with each individual\u2019s pursuit of a meaningful life\nof his own. As Bader points out, for Nozick,\n\nIt is not the case that living a meaningful life is the goal that is\nto be achieved and that rights are the means that permit us to attain\nthis goal. Rather, it is in virtue of the fact that human beings are\nagents whose lives can have meaning that we need to respect their\nchoices, that we have to let them decide how to live their lives.\n(Bader 79\u201380)\n\n2.4 The Attenuation of Rights\n\nNozick\u2019s account of rights takes a surprising turn in his very\ncomplex chapter 4 on \u201cProhibition, Compensation, and Risk\u201d\n(Mack 1981). Employing the language of rights as moral boundaries,\nNozick asks whether all actions that cross boundaries may be\nprohibited, i.e., may permissibly be\n punished.[11]\n His unexpected answer is that not all boundary crossings may be\nprohibited. Some boundary crossings are to be allowed\u2014without\nthe consent of those subject to them\u2014as long as due compensation\nis paid to those subjects. Nozick\u2019s presumption within this\nchapter is that it does not follow from\nB\u2019s having a right against A to\nA\u2019s not inflicting treatment T on B\nthat A\u2019s inflicting T on A may be\nprohibited (59). All that follows from B\u2019s\nhaving that right is that A may not inflict T on\nB unless A also duly compensates\n B.[12]\n All that follows is that B has a claim against\nA that A\u2019s infliction of T on\nB not leave B\u2019s utility or welfare on net\ndiminished.\n\nWe can describe Nozick\u2019s position here by utilizing the now\ncommon distinction between claims that are protected by property rules\nand claims that are protected by liability rules (338n6). One\u2019s\nclaim with respect to some object O is protected by a\nproperty rule if one must be allowed to do as one sees fit with\nO\u2014as long as one abides by the applicable side\nconstraints. Others may not deprive one of one\u2019s choice with\nrespect to O\u2014even if they also compensate one for the\nutility or welfare loss of being precluded from doing as one sees fit\nwith O. In contrast, one\u2019s claim with respect to\nO is merely protected by a liability rule if others may\ndetermine (without one\u2019s consent) what is done with O\nas long as they duly compensate one for the associated utility or\nwelfare loss. In chapter 4, Nozick\u2019s presumption seems to be\nthat all that follows from one\u2019s having a right is that\none has a claim that is protected by a liability rule.\n\nOf course, it may be impossible or severely difficult for A\nto duly compensate B for inflicting treatment\nT\u2014as when T consists in killing B.\nMoreover, if it is impossible or severely difficult for A to\nduly compensate B for a given boundary crossing, A\nmust not cross that boundary without B\u2019s consent. The\nconjunction of the liability rule claim and the impossibility\nor difficulty of due compensation yields (the equivalent of) a\nproperty rule claim for B against A\u2019s imposing\nT on B. The further conditions that render due\ncompensation impossible or difficult boost what would otherwise merely\nbe a liability rule claim against being subject to T into\n(the equivalent of) a property rule claim against being subject to\nT. As we see in the next section, Nozick thinks that such\nboosting conditions are pervasive. So, one of the things that Nozick\nis suggesting in his intricate chapter 4 is that, even the\nseparateness of persons in itself only underwrites claims protected by\nliability rules, those claims need to be treated as though they are\nprotected by property rules whenever due compensation for infringing\nupon them would be impossible or not feasible.\n\nPerhaps, we ought not to be too surprised by Nozick\u2019s chapter 4\npresumption that in themselves rights are merely claims that are\nprotected by liability rules. For recall the crucial role ascribed to\nnatural rights within Nozick\u2019s separateness of persons argument.\nThat role is to provide individuals with moral protection against\nhaving sacrifices (i.e., net losses) imposed upon them. All that\nrights must do in order to play this role is to require that\nall boundary-crossings be accompanied by due compensation (and that\nthey not be done if the provision of due accompanying compensation is\nnot feasible).\n\nHowever, Nozick\u2019s focus on rights having the role of protecting\nindividuals from net losses being imposed upon them raised concerns\nfor him about whether invocations of rights would deliver the strong\nanti-paternalism that he\n favored.[13]\n If rights are in themselves merely claims against having one\u2019s\nutility or welfare on net lowered by certain interferences, then one\nwill have no right against interferences that on net raise one\u2019s\nutility or welfare. Arguments that \u201cwill prohibit sacrificing\none person to benefit another\u201d will not themselves deliver\n\u201ca prohibition on paternalist aggression\u201d (34). Rights\nagainst paternalist interventions that really do serve interests of\nthe paternalized party must protect the choices of that\nparty\u2014even choices that will lower her utility or welfare.\n\nMoreover, the view that rights in themselves are claims protected by\nliability rules does not comport well with the overall tone of\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia. Nozick does not begin this work\nby declaring that there are things that may not be done to individuals\nunless, of course, they are duly compensated. Nor does the\nliability rule construal of rights fit well with Nozick\u2019s\naffirmation of the inviolability of individuals, the Kantian claim\nthat individuals \u201cmay not be sacrificed or used for the\nachieving of other ends without their consent\u201d (31,\nemphasis added), or the moral sovereignty of individuals (34). Indeed,\nat one point Nozick himself says that \u201ca system permitting\nboundary crossing, provided compensation is paid, embodies the use\nof persons as means\u2026\u201d (71, emphasis added). It\nembodies the use of persons as means because it allows such use as\nlong as the utility or welfare of the used party is not on net\ndiminished. The provision of due compensation may counteract the\nimposed loss of utility or welfare; but it does not counteract the\nwrong of the use.\n\nIn the next section, we shall focus on Nozick\u2019s use of this\nliability rule attenuation of rights in his response to the anarchist.\nWe should note, however, that after disposing of the anarchist Nozick\nreverts to the more robust property rule understanding of rights.\nThus, in chapter 7, on \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d, Nozick says\nthat,\n\n\nThe central core of the notion of a property rights in X\n\u2026 is the right to determine what shall be done with X,\nthe right to choose which of the constrained set of options concerning\nX shall be realized or attempted. (171)\n\n\nTo have a right in X is to have a claim protected by a\nproperty rule. Others\u2019 interference with one\u2019s doing as\none sees fit with X is impermissible\u2014even if one is\nduly compensated for imposed utility or welfare losses. And Nozick\ngoes on to extend this property rule construal to people\u2019s\nrights in themselves and their labor.\n\n\nThis notion of property helps us understand why earlier theorists\nspoke of people as having property in themselves and their labor. They\nviewed each person as having a right to decide what would become of\nhimself and what he would do\u2026 (171)\n\n\nIndeed, in chapter 7, Nozick argues that seizing the fruits of a\nperson\u2019s labor is impermissible because this involves taking the\ntime that this person devoted to this labor without that\nperson\u2019s consent. There is no hint that the taking of that time\nwithout that party\u2019s consent would be permissible if only that\nparty were duly compensated. There is no hint that the requirement\nthat this individual consent to any taking depends upon due\ncompensation for such a taking being impossible or severely\ndifficult.\n\nWe should also note that this passage about earlier theorists speaking\nof people as having property in themselves is the closest Nozick ever\ncomes to formulating his own position in terms of a doctrine of\nself-ownership. Contrary to common presentations of\nNozick\u2019s doctrine, there is no mention of self-ownership within\nhis Part I discussion of state of nature\n theory.[14]\n Throughout Part I, Nozick is content to have his readers fill in the\ncontent of moral side constraints by drawing on their intuitions that,\nif there are any moral side constraints, they must include constraints\nagainst (unprovoked) killing, assaulting, maiming, enslaving. There\nis, at most, a hint that all of these constraints can be subsumed\nunder a general constraint against aggression (34). (It seems,\nhowever, that aggression itself requires explication on the basis of a\nprior and independent specification of persons\u2019 rights.)\n\nOverall, Nozick maintains that there is something about the\nseparateness of persons\u2014something about the propriety of each\nseeking his own good in his own chosen way\u2014that does not merely\nundermine the view that individuals should sacrifice themselves (and\nothers) for the social good. Beyond that undermining, the separateness\nof persons positively supports each individual\u2019s possession of\nfundamental, broad, natural, and negative moral claims that hold\nagainst all other agents. What Nozick needs is a more clearly\narticulated and persuasive transition from each individual having ends\nof his own that he is rational to pursue (and, hence, there being no\nproper moral balancing across persons) to each individual having a\nmoral status vis-\u00e1-vis others that provides others\nwith reason not to interfere with his chosen pursuits even in ways\nthat would be on net beneficial to that individual. Nozick provides\nmaterial that is suggestive of this transition but certainly not a\ncompelling case for it. Nozick also fails to address the hard question\nof why\u2014except perhaps to avoid \u201ccatastrophic moral\nhorror\u201d (29 footnote*)\u2014rights always trump considerations\nof personal or social well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, it would certainly be unfair to Nozick to insist\nthat there be one or a few core foundationalist arguments on which all\nof the rest of his doctrine firmly rests. It is clear that Nozick\nthinks that the coherence that obtains among the stances he develops\nwithin ASU enhances the plausibility of each of those\nstances. For instance, while his historical entitlement theory of\njustice in holdings is largely grounded in his critique of alternative\nconceptions of economic justice, Nozick takes the coherence between\nthis theory with his affirmation of basic moral side constraints to\nincrease the plausibility of his doctrine as a whole. Similarly,\nNozick takes the coherence of his rights based defense of the minimal\nstate in Part I of ASU with his less moralistic defense of\nthe minimal state as a framework for utopia in Part III to enhance the\noverall case for the minimal\n state.[15]\n3. The Minimal State versus Individualist Anarchism\n\nThe official purpose of Part I of ASU is to rebut the\nindividualist anarchist\u2019s claim that no state, not even the\nminimal, nightwatchman, state can be\n justified.[16]\n In this way, Part I is devoted to what Nozick takes to be the\nfundamental question of political philosophy, viz., \u201cwhether\nthere should be any state at all\u201d (4). Nozick seeks to counter\nthe anarchist\u2019s claim by showing how a minimal\nstate\u2014essentially a state that is limited to the protection of\nthe rights of person, property, and contract\u2014could arise without\nviolating rights. At a later point within this section, we shall have\nto consider why Nozick focuses upon whether a minimal state could\narise without violating rights rather than whether a minimal\nstate could function without violating rights.\n3.1 The Challenge of Individualist Anarchism\n\nNozick expects that it will take a considerable effort to answer the\nindividualist anarchist precisely because this form of anti-statism is\nitself rooted in the moral rights that Nozick proclaims. Indeed,\nimmediately following his ascription to individuals of pre-political,\npre-contractual, negative moral rights Nozick tells us that these\nrights may so extensively limit the permissible use of force that no\nroom is left for a morally acceptable state.\n\n\nSo strong and far-reaching are these rights that they raise the\nquestion of what, if anything the state and its officials may do. How\nmuch room do individual rights leave for the state? (ix)\n\n\nTo be clear about Nozick\u2019s response, we first need to be clear\nabout what alternative structure for the protection of rights is\nenvisioned by the individualist anarchist. Second, we need to clearly\nidentify the precise challenge that Nozick needs to overcome.\n\nFirst, then, Nozick and the individualist anarchist agree that it is\none thing for individuals to have rights and another thing for them to\nhave rights to the protection of their rights. It is one thing to have\na right against others that they not aggress against one; it is\nanother thing to have rights against others that they protect one\nagainst aggression. Being a positive right, the right to protection\nagainst violations of one\u2019s rights must arise through some\nspecial interaction between the agent who acquires the right and the\nagent who acquires the correlative obligation. The most common kind of\nspecial interaction that gives rise to one agent having a positive\nright against another is contract. However, the individualist\nanarchist and Nozick agree that there has never been any general\nsocial contract whereby individuals at large acquire from one another\npositive rights to the protection of their pre-contractual rights.\nAnd, \u201c\u2026 tacit consent isn\u2019t worth the paper\nit\u2019s not written on\u201d (287). Hence, if people are to\nacquire rights to have their rights protected, they must (at least for\nthe most part) go shopping for them.\n\nMoreover, the individualist anarchist asserts\u2014and Nozick is\nstrongly disposed to agree\u2014that shoppers for any sort of service\nwill do best when there is a competitive market in the supply of that\nsort of service. Competition among good-willed providers of the\nservice of rights protection will induce lower prices and/or higher\nquality rights protection\u2014including protection against\n\u201coutlaw\u201d agencies that seek to assist or protect rights\nviolators. The interest of good-willed purchasers of rights protection\nin non-violent dispute resolution will press competing suppliers of\nrights protection to join in agreements that more sharply define the\nboundaries of their clients and establish procedures for resolving\ndisputes among them. Any protective agency that is not part of a\nnetwork of established conflict diminishing agreements and resolution\nprocedures will be at a huge competitive disadvantage. Nozick refers\nto the resulting network as the dominant protective association; and\nhe treats the question of whether the minimal state can arise without\nviolating rights as a matter of whether such a dominant protective\nassociation can develop into a minimal state without violating\nrights.\n\nSecond, anarchists like Rothbard assert that the creation and\nmaintenance of even the minimal state will violate rights in two\nfundamental ways. First, even the minimal state will arise through and\nsustain itself through imposed taxation. Second, even the minimal\nstate will arise through and sustain itself through the coercive\nsuppression or control of competing protective agencies. However, the\nminimal state that Nozick seeks to defend is simply not subject to the\nfirst of these challenges. For, despite some ill-chosen language that\nsuggests the contrary (26\u20137), Nozick\u2019s minimal state does\nnot impose taxation\u2014even to fund its rights protective\n activities.[17]\n Nozick\u2019s minimal state does prohibit individuals who interact\nwith its clients from becoming clients of competing agencies (that are\nnot subject to supervision and constraint by the minimal state).\nHowever, it does not require anyone to subscribe to its services.\nPrincipled anarchists and even individuals who hope to free-ride on\nthe minimal state\u2019s overall suppression of rights\n violations[18]\n are morally at liberty to take their chances.\n\nHowever, to be a state\u2014even a minimal state\u2014an\ninstitution has to have some sort of monopoly on the use of coercive\nforce over a sufficiently large territory or set of people. To rise to\nstatehood within a given territory or with respect to a set of people,\na protective agency must fairly successfully fulfill its aspiration to\nbe the suppressor of other actors who seek to engage in rights\nviolating force and (at least) to be the controller of other actors\nwho seek to engage in rights protecting force. Hence, to rise to\nstatehood, a protective agency must either shut down or exercise\nsubstantial control over other non-outlaw agencies. In short,\nit seems that it must act toward its non-outlaw competitors in ways\nthat Nozick would declare to be impermissible among competitors in the\ndelivery of any other sort of service. Nozick must attempt to meet the\nanarchist\u2019s second challenge by arguing that the dominant\nprotective agency\u2019s establishment of a monopoly in protective\nservices differs markedly from the standard suppression or control of\ncompetitors.\n3.2 Response to the Anarchist Challenge\n\nBefore considering how and how successfully Nozick meets this\nchallenge, we need to take note of a questionable preliminary move on\nhis part. When Nozick mentions the agreements that competing agencies\nwould enter into in order to assure their prospective clients smooth\nand non-violent dispute resolution, he speaks of the emergence of\n\u201ca system of appeals courts and agreed upon rules of\njurisdiction and the conflict of laws\u201d. He acknowledges that the\nemergence of this system allows for the continued operation of\n\u201cdifferent agencies\u201d. Yet he then says that the result is\n\u201cone unified federal judicial system of which they [presumably\nthe various agencies] all are components\u201d (16). On the basis of\nthis description of the outcome of the networking process Nozick\nallows himself to speak of the rise of a dominant protective\nassociation that is united and federal.\n\nThis language seems to paper over the continued existence of\n\u201cdifferent agencies\u201d which may well compete with one\nanother not merely in terms of prices but also in terms of the\npackages of protective services they offer in response to diverse\nconsumer demand for such services. So Nozick faces a problem even if\nhe succeeds in showing that the confederation of agencies\nthat emerges from such networking may permissibly eliminate its\nnon-outlaw competitors. For, there may still be too much competition\namong the confederates that make up the dominant association\nfor it to qualify as a state (Childs 1977 and Mack 1978).\n\nPutting that initial problem aside, one possible way for Nozick to\nmeet the anarchist\u2019s challenge is to maintain that the dominant\nprotective association will eliminate its competitors without\nusing coercive force. Perhaps something about the production and\ndelivery of rights protection makes that enterprise a natural\nmonopoly. Nozick seems to be pursuing this route when he asks and\nanswers the question, \u201cWhy would a virtual monopoly arise in\nthis market without the government intervention that elsewhere creates\nand maintains it?\u201d (17). His answer is that the value of the\nprotective services offered by any agency will increase with the size\nof its clientele\u2014presumably because disputes among clients of\nthe same agency will be more cheaply or readily resolved than disputes\namong clients of competing agencies. So, clients of competing agencies\nwill migrate to the dominant association and that migration will\nincrease the incentive for yet others to follow the same\n path.[19]\n\nHowever, this claim about the propensity for \u201cvirtual\u201d\nmonopoly to arise within the rights protection business is only\nintended by Nozick to explain the emergence of a dominant protective\nassociation; it is not intended to explain that association\u2019s\npermissible suppression or control of its remaining non-outlaw\ncompetitors. Nozick accepts the anarchist contention that, for an\nagency to rise to or sustain itself as a state, it must suppress or\ncontrol actual (or potential) non-outlaw competitors. To meet the\nanarchist\u2019s challenge, Nozick sets out to show how the dominant\nassociation\u2019s suppression or control of non-outlaw competitors\nis not a violation of the rights of those competitors\u2014even\nthough they are non-outlaws.\n\nNozick\u2019s case relies upon the surprising attenuation of rights\nthat we noted in the previous section, viz., the idea that in\nthemselves rights are claims that are protected by liability rules.\nAbsent further conditions that make due compensation for infringements\nimpossible or severely difficult, rights are merely claims to be duly\ncompensated for losses imposed by certain interferences. Given this\nconstrual of rights, the basic structure of Nozick\u2019s response to\nthe anarchist is quite simple. The rights of non-outlaw protective\nagencies (and non-outlaw independent self-protectors) to engage in\ntheir chosen procedures are merely claims that are protected by\nliability rules. Hence, those procedures may be interfered with as\nlong as those subject to this interference are duly compensated. The\nanarchist is correct in saying that these non-outlaw agencies and\nindividuals have rights against being interfered with; but he is\nmistaken in thinking that these rights forbid that interference.\n\nOf course, a further premise is needed for this argument. This is that\nit will not be impossible or severely difficult to duly compensate\nthose non-outlaw agencies and individuals for interference with their\nown protective activities and, hence, their claims against such\ninterference do not acquire the force of claims protected by property\nrules. (If the claims do acquire that force, the anarchist correctly\ncondemns the dominant association\u2019s interference with those\nagencies or individuals.) To support this further premise, Nozick\nneeds to survey the conditions that do made it impossible or severely\ndifficult to supply due compensation for boundary crossings. A\nboundary will have the force of a claim protected by a property rule\nif and only if such a condition is present. Much of the intricacy (and\nopacity) of ASU\u2019s chapter 4 resides within this\nsurvey.\n\nThere are some boundary crossings\u2014like killings, maiming, or and\nlifetime enslaving\u2014for which due compensation is simply\nimpossible.\n\n\nIf some injuries are not compensable, they would not fall\nunder a policy of being allowed as long as compensation is paid.\n(Rather, they would be allowed provided compensation was paid, but\nsince the compensation could not be paid by anyone, in effect they\nwould be unallowed.) (65\u20136)\n\n\nHowever, Nozick focuses on two factors that severely complicate the\ntask of identifying due compensation for boundary crossings. The first\nis fear (65\u201371). Here is one way that fear complicates the\nidentification of due compensation. Suppose we treat the right that\neach individual has not to have her forearm broken as a claim\nprotected by a liability rule. And suppose further that we know what\nthe due compensation is for having one\u2019s forearm broken. On this\nbasis we decide to allow unconsented to forearm breaking as long as\nthe forearm breaker duly compensates the subject of his ministrations.\nThe effect of this will be to make many people fearful of having their\narms broken who will never receive compensation for that fear because\ntheir arms will not in fact be\n broken.[20]\n Or if people are to be compensated simply for their fear, individuals\nwhose conduct induces fear may be required to make compensation\npayments even though they never in fact break forearms. These sorts of\nproblems are mitigated if the right not to have one\u2019s forearm\nbroken is treated as a claim protected by a property right.\n\nThe second factor that complicates recourse to due compensation for\nunconsented to boundary crossings is the fact that the best procedure\nfor identifying the due compensation for a crossing is to require\nantecedent negotiation with and consent by the party who will be\nsubject to the crossing (63\u201365). The best way to identify the\ndue compensation for A for having her forearm broken by\nB is to see what payment A will accept to allow\nB to break her arm. However, this requires the\nprohibition of the boundary crossing under discussion unless\nthe subject of the action agrees to it. When antecedent negotiation\nbetween subject A and actor B is feasible, the best\nroute to due compensation for A (which is required under the\nliability rule construal of A\u2019s right) consists in\ntreating A\u2019s right against B\u2019s proposed\naction as a claim that is protected by a property rule. Especially\nsince antecedent negotiation between subjects and actors is usually\nfeasible, even rights that are in themselves only protected by\nliability rules are usually to be treated as boundaries that may not\nwithout consent be crossed.\n\nNozick describes the task of identifying the compensation due to\nA for undergoing B\u2019s chosen action as the task\nof identifying the just division of the benefits generated by\nB\u2019s action. B gains through his action; but\njustice requires that he share those gains with\nA\u2014especially since the immediate effect of\nB\u2019s action is a loss for A. The just division\nof the benefits is the division that A and B would\nsettle upon in conjunction with A\u2019s agreement to be\nsubject to the action in question. And the best procedure for\nidentifying what terms would be settled upon is to require antecedent\nnegotiation and consent\u2014when antecedent negotiation and consent\nis feasible.\n\nWe can now return to Nozick\u2019s core argument against the\nanarchist\u2019s challenge. Nozick calls for a three-fold distinction\namong agencies and individuals who operate outside of the dominant\nprotective association. At one end of the spectrum are outlaw agencies\nor rogue individuals who either aim to perform actions that cross\nboundaries or pose substantial risks of crossing boundaries through\ntheir recklessness or negligence. The actions of such agencies or\nindividuals may simply be suppressed to protect the rights that they\n threaten.[21]\n At the other end of the spectrum are agencies or individuals who are\nknown to the dominant association to pursue rights protection in ways\nthat are not markedly more likely to violate the rights of the\nassociation\u2019s clients than the procedures of the association is\nlikely to violate rights. Given its own procedures, the association\ncannot honestly proclaim that its clients have rights against the\nactivities of these well-behaved agencies and individuals. (But the\nassociation may know that they are well-behaved precisely through its\nmonitoring of those agencies and individuals.) In the middle of the\nspectrum are agencies and individuals whose procedures are not so\nrisky as to justify straight-forward prohibition but are risky enough\nso that those whose rights are threatened seem to have some\nrights-based justification for suppressing those procedures.\n\nAccording to Nozick, there would be no good answer to the question of\nhow the dominant association should act toward agents in the middle of\nthe spectrum if the association had to choose between straight-forward\nsuppression and securing the voluntary consent of those agents to\ncease or modify their procedures. But, fortunately, an intermediate\nmode of action is available to the dominant association, viz.,\ncrossing the boundaries that protect those unacceptably risky\nprocedures while duly compensating the subjects of those\ncrossings.\n\n\nIt might be objected that either you have the right to forbid these\npeople\u2019s risky activities or you don\u2019t. If you do, you\nneedn\u2019t compensate the people for doing to them what you have a\nright to do; and if you don\u2019t \u2026 you ought simply to stop\n[the forbidding]\u2026 . But the dilemma, \u201ceither you have a\nright to forbid it so that you needn\u2019t compensate, or you\ndon\u2019t have a right to forbid it so you should stop,\u201d is\ntoo short. It may be that you do have a right to forbid an action but\nonly provided you compensate those to whom it is forbidden. (83)\n\n\nNozick\u2019s crucial move against the anarchist depends, then, on\nconstruing the claims to non-interference of agents who engage in\nactions that pose moderate risk to others\u2019 rights as claims that\nare merely protected by liability rules. Since, they are merely\nprotected by liability rules, those actions may be interfered with as\nlong as those subject to that interference are duly compensated.\n\nWhy, though, do the rights of those who pose moderate risk to\nothers\u2019 rights not acquire the force of claims protected by\nproperty rules? With respect to the fear factor, Nozick seems simply\nto assume that the dominant association\u2019s measures to suppress\nor control the activities of those moderately dangerous (but\nnon-outlaw) agencies and individuals generate no complicating fear.\nWith respect to the division of benefits factor, Nozick seems to hold\nthat those who suppress (or mitigate) risky conduct by others should\nnot be thought of as thereby benefiting. They are essentially\nmerely diminishing the likelihood of harm being\n done.[22]\n Thus, there is no need for antecedent negotiation to determine the\njust division of the benefits generated by the dominant\nassociation\u2019s suppression or mitigation of the moderately risky\nprocedures of independent agencies or individuals. Everything else\nbeing equal, it seems to follow that moderately risky procedures by\nthose independents may be suppressed or mitigated without any\ncompensation. (Rather, it seems that they can be suppressed or\nmitigated with due compensation; but the due compensation is no\ncompensation.)\n\nHowever, according to Nozick, everything else is not quite equal. Some\nof these independent individuals or agencies may have adopted\nmoderately risky procedures because they (or their clients) cannot\nafford more fastidious procedures. According to Nozick, if we\nhad \u201ca theory of disadvantage\u201d (82), it would tell us that\nthese independents (or these clients) will be disadvantaged by the\ndominant association\u2019s interference with those moderately risky\nprocedures. They will be disadvantaged even though they are only\nengaged in (or subscribing to) procedures that might infringe\non others\u2019 rights. So, Nozick concludes, the suppression or\nmitigation of the procedures engaged in (or subscribed to) by these\nindependents must be accompanied by compensation for disadvantages\nimposed upon them. Thus, we arrive at Nozick\u2019s principle of\ncompensation:\n\n\nthose who are disadvantaged by being forbidden to do actions\nthat only might harm others must be compensated for these\ndisadvantages foisted upon them in order to provide security for the\nothers. (82\u20133)\n\n\nThis principle of compensation explains (or expresses) the\njustification for the dominant association stepping in to suppress or\nexercise mitigating control over the procedures of moderately risky\n(but non-outlaw) agencies and individuals.\n\nHow does the principle of compensation get us to the minimal state?\nAccording to Nozick, through its enforced oversight over others\u2019\nprovision of protective services the association exercises enough of a\nmonopoly over the provision of those services to become an\nultra-minimal state. However, under the principle of\ncompensation, the dominant association\u2019s interference with\nmoderately risky independents who are disadvantaged by this\ninterference will be permissible only if the association compensates\nthose independents for those disadvantages. Nozick envisions that\ncompensation naturally taking the form of the ultra-minimal state\nproviding free or subsidized protective services to those who will\n(otherwise) be disadvantaged by its interferences. When the\nultra-minimal state secures the permissibility of its monopoly\noversight by providing free or subsidized protection to those who are\n(otherwise) disadvantaged by its oversight it becomes a (legitimate)\nminimal state.\n\nIn asserting the permissibility of its enforced oversight, the\ndominant association does not maintain that it has some unique claim\nto suppress or control moderately risky agencies or individuals.\nNevertheless, by being the dominant association, it alone is in\nposition to act under the aegis of the principle of compensation\n(108\u2013110). Nozick\u2019s minimal state provides free or\nsubsidized protective services to some parties. To pay for those free\nor subsidized services, the minimal state charges its paying customers\nmore than it otherwise would. This may appear to be enforced\nredistribution; but it is not. For, the additional charges incurred by\nthe minimal state\u2019s paying clients simply are payments that are\nneeded to fund compensation that must be paid if the oversight that is\nimposed on behalf of the clients\u2019 security is to be\npermissible.\n\nNozick provides an important second argument on behalf of the dominant\nassociation\u2019s monopolistic oversight and constraint of other\nprotective agencies. This argument focuses on procedural\nrights. Do the clients of the dominant association have (natural)\nprocedural rights against having moderately risky protective measures\ndirected against them? Nozick recognizes that it seems implausible to\naffirm procedural rights in the state of nature. Yet he seeks to back\ninto such rights by starting with the proposition that even in the\nstate of nature C acts wrongly and impermissibly\ntoward D if C extracts restitution payments from\nD or punishes D without knowing (or having a\nwell-justified belief) that D has violated C\u2019s\nrights; C acts wrongly and impermissibly even if D\nhas in fact violated those rights and the restitution or punishment\nimposed by C is appropriate for that violation (106). Nozick\ntakes the wrongness and impermissibility of C\u2019s\nepistemically ill-grounded reaction to justify the prohibition of\nC\u2019s action against the guilty D. So D\nhas at least the equivalent of a procedural right against\nC\u2019s epistemically ill-grounded conduct (107). The\ndominant association can permissibly rise to statehood by enforcing\nits clients\u2019 (equivalent of) procedural rights against those\nmoderately risky\n competitors.[23]\n The problem here seems to be that, if saying that C\u2019s\nill-grounded reaction is \u201cimpermissible\u201d is merely another\nway of saying that it is morally defective, one cannot infer from its\nimpermissibility that it may be prohibited. It seems that one can only\ninfer that C\u2019s reaction may be prohibited if that\nreaction is impermissible in the much stronger sense of being\n(equivalent to) rights-violating. But one cannot assert that the\nreaction is impermissible in this stronger sense unless one already\nassumes what Nozick is purporting to show, viz., that there is a\nprocedural right (or something equivalent to such a right) that the\nill-grounded reaction violates.\n3.3 Further Observations about the Minimal State\n\nWe have already noted that Nozick\u2019s minimal state differs from\ncommon depictions of the minimal state because it does not impose\ntaxation to finance its services. In many other ways as well, it is\nmore like a business enterprise than a state. There are no rulers, no\nlegislative body, no political elections, no contending parties and\ncitizens. There is no sovereignty and no state territory. There are,\ninstead, executives, a board of directors, shareholders, clients, and\nthe assets of the enterprise. But the fly in the enterprise ointment\nis the absence of competitive market constraints on the price or the\nquality of the services offered by this monopoly. (If there is enough\nmarket competition to keep prices of protective services down and\ntheir quality up, there will be too much competition for this\nenterprise to count as a state.) It appears that the only other way to\nkeep this monopoly in check would be through some sort of\npolitical-constitutional constraints. However, Nozick makes no mention\nof these. Of course, a protective association in pursuit of customers\nmight commit itself to constitution-like constraints on its\ndecisions and conduct as a way of reassuring potential clients. (Mack\n2018 110\u2013124)\n\nIt is striking that a more direct route to a more conventional minimal\nstate\u2014i.e., one that would fund the production of rights\nprotection through taxes\u2014is available to Nozick. (Mack\n2011) That route is opened by his shift to the liability rule\nconstrual of rights. On that construal each individual\u2019s right\nto her financial assets is at base merely a right to receive due\ncompensation for the seizure of those assets. So, if the dominant\nassociation taxes individuals\u2014seizes some of their financial\nassets without their consent\u2014but provides compensating benefits\nfor each of those individuals in the form of protective services, the\nassociation\u2019s conduct will be perfectly permissible. On\nNozick\u2019s view, such non-negotiated accompanying compensation\nwill be inferior to antecedently negotiated terms of exchange if\nsuch prior negotiation would have been feasible. However, Nozick\ncould have advanced the common argument that such prior negotiation of\npayment for protective services would not be feasible.\n\nThat argument turns on the special public good feature of a system of\nrights protection, viz., that, if such a good is produced, if will be\ndifficult to exclude individuals who do not voluntarily pay for that\nsystem from enjoying (many of) the benefits generated by the system.\nPerhaps the police whom I have not voluntarily paid won\u2019t\nrespond to my calls for assistance. But they will respond to\nthe calls of my paying neighbors and, as a result, I will enjoy a\nlower level of neighborhood crime. Accordingly, antecedent\nnegotiations about payment for protection will not be feasible because\na significant number of individuals would decline to offer payment in\nthe hope that they would to get (most of) the benefits of the\nproduction of those services even if they do not contract for\n them.[24]\n Hence, assuming that the taxation to fund the public good of rights\nprotection is not itself feared, the rights to the financial assets\nthat are seized in that taxation remain claims that are merely\nprotected by liability rules. According to his argument, since the\nprovision of that protection duly compensates for the seizures, the\nimposition of those taxes is\n permissible.[25]\n\nOne strand that runs throughout ASU is Nozick\u2019s\ninterest in invisible-hand explanations\u2014explanations of complex\norders like the adjustment of supply and demand in market economies\nthat do not appeal to anyone\u2019s intention to bring about the\nexplained order (18\u201322). For Nozick, part of the charm of his\nstory about the emergence of the minimal state is that it is an\ninvisible hand story. The dominant association backs into being a\nstate without really trying (to be a state) (118\u2013119). This\ncontrasts with the visible hand quality of social contract\nexplanations or justifications of the state. Of course, no\nactual minimal state is explained or justified by\nNozick\u2019s invisible hand explanation. This is no philosophical\nproblem because there is no actual minimal state that Nozick sets out\nto justify.\n\nHowever, Nozick does seem to be committed to the view that the\nlegitimacy of any actual minimal state that might arise will depend\nupon its having arisen through permissible, rights respecting\nactivities; and this seems to be a problem. Consider a minimal state\nthat comes into existence when some aggressive individuals seize\ncontrol of a powerful coercive apparatus that has been built up\nthrough many years of murder and plunder but then immediately undergo\nconversion into conscientious libertarians. As quickly as they can\nthose individuals redirect the coercive power at their disposal from\naggressions against life, liberty, and property to the suppression of\nrights violations by non-violating means. It seems that our judgment\nabout the legitimacy of this minimal state should turn at least\nprimarily on how it now conducts itself and not on the\nimpermissibility of the actions through which this state was founded\n(Paul 1979).\n\nA new angle on this topic is presented in Ralf Bader\u2019s ingenious\nexplanation of how Nozick\u2019s account of the way in which minimal\nstates would arise without violating rights supports a demand\nin justice that actual more-than-minimal states be transformed into\nminimal states. (Bader 2017) The key is Bader\u2019s idea that the\nrectification of economic injustice and the rectification of (what\nmight be called) political justice are isomorphic. Economic\nrectification requires the transition from an array of holdings that\nis at least in part the product of rights violations to the array of\nholdings that would have arisen had holdings arisen justly.\nIn parallel fashion, political rectification requires the transition\nfrom political institutions that are at least in part the product of\nrights violations to the political institutions that would\nhave arisen had political institutions arisen justly. Nozick\u2019s\ncounterfactual account of the minimal state reveals that this is sort\nof political institution into which actual more-than-minimal states\nmust, as a matter of justice, be transformed.\n4. Justice in Holdings\n\nWhile the core official purpose of Part I of ASU is the\ndefense of the minimal state against the anarchist critique, the core\nofficial purpose of Part II of ASU, is to argue that\n\u201cno more extensive state can be justified\u201d (xi). In\nchapter 8 of Part II, \u201cEquality, Envy, Exploitation,\nEtc.\u201d, Nozick seeks to counter the force of a series of\nconsiderations that are invoked on behalf of a more extensive state.\nThese include equality, equal opportunity, meaningful work,\nworkers\u2019 control, and exploitation. In chapter 9 of part II,\n\u201cDemoktesis\u201d, he constructs an invisible hand account of\nthe rise of an unconstrained democratic state. The intention seems to\nbe to undercut the appeal of such a state by showing what sorts of\nunattractive, albeit permissible, actions individuals would have to\nengage in to arrive at such a state. Nozick needs, then, to explain\nwhy a hypothetical invisible hand explanation of the minimal state\nmuch more legitimates it than a hypothetical invisible hand\nexplanation of the unconstrained democratic state legitimates it\n(292\u2013294).\n\nStill, by far the most philosophically important chapter of Part II is\nchapter 7, \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d in which Nozick seeks to\ncounter the view that a more extensive state is justified as an\ninstrument of distributive justice. This chapter has been the subject\nof the bulk of the philosophical commentary on ASU. In this\nchapter, Nozick sketches his \u201chistorical entitlement\u201d\nconception of justice in holdings, provides a number of quite general\narguments against all alternative conceptions of justice in holdings,\nendorses a Lockean Proviso that adds a bit of complexity to the\nentitlement doctrine, and provides a powerful critique of Rawls\u2019\ncase in A Theory of Justice for his strongly redistributive\n\u201cdifference principle\u201d. This section focuses on the first\nthree of these topics.\n4.1 The Historical Entitlement Doctrine about Justice in Holdings\n\nNozick\u2019s approach to justice in holdings has to be seen as\nemerging from his broad construal of the implications of the\nRawlsian-Nozickean critique of utilitarianism. Whereas Rawls concludes\nthat a due respect for the separateness of persons precludes imposing\nlosses on individuals for the sake of the general welfare, Nozick\nconcludes that it precludes imposing losses upon individuals for the\nsake of any conception of the overall social\ngood\u2014including deeply distribution-sensitive conceptions. The\njustice of a given individual\u2019s possession of and discretionary\ncontrol over certain economic goods cannot be a function of that\npossession and control contributing to the general welfare or\nto any other overall social end-state or pattern. All such\nconsequentialist assessments of holdings are ruled out of court. So,\nif there is any acceptable account of the justice of individual\nholdings, it must be a backward-looking account. The justification\nmust depend upon how the holdings in question have arisen.\n\nIf the holding came about by permissible and title-conferring modes of\naction, the possessor will be entitled to it. If the holding came\nabout by modes of action that are not permissible (or are permissible\nbut not title-conferring) the possessor will not be entitled to it.\nThus, entitlements are historical. Individual A will have an\nentitlement to holding H if and only if A\u2019s\npossession of H has the right sort of history. This stance\naccords with the common-sense intuition that an agent\u2019s\nacquiring economically valuable objects in certain ways\u2014e.g.,\ncreating those objects out of unowned natural\nmaterials\u2014generates entitlements for that agent over those\nobjects while an agent\u2019s acquiring objects in other\nways\u2014e.g., seizing those objects from another who has created\nthem out of unowned natural materials\u2014does not generate\nentitlements for that agent over those objects. A distribution of\nholdings across individuals will be just insofar as the particular\nholdings that constitute that distribution are just\u2014rather than\nthe justice of any particular individual\u2019s holding depending on\nthe holistic justice of the distribution of which it is a part.\n\nJust acquisition takes the form of just initial acquisition, just\ntransfer, or just rectification of an unjust taking. An existing\nholding will be just if it arises from an act of just initial\nacquisition or an act of just initial acquisition followed by one or\nmore acts of just transfer, or an act of just rectification that\ncounteracts an unjust taking of a just holding. An adequate theory of\njustice in holdings will specify the processes that constitute just\ninitial acquisitions, just transfers, and just acts of rectification.\nNozick tells us that each of these principles is a \u201ccomplicated\ntruth\u201d (150) that he will not attempt to formulate. Thus, we\nnever get statements from Nozick of what specific initial acquisition\nor transfer or rectification processes that result in agent\nC\u2019s possession of H generate or convey to\nC an entitlement over H. Nozick never directly seeks\nto explain why certain specific processes\u2014certain specific means\nof acquisition\u2014have the power to generate or convey\nentitlements. He never addresses the ways in which historical\ncontingency and convention may select (from among morally eligible\nprocedures) the specific procedures that count as entitlement\nconferring within a given society. (Mack 2010 and Bryan 2017)\n\nNozick\u2019s lack of specification and explanation has mislead\ncommentators such as Cohen into thinking that, for Nozick, any not\nunjust process that results in C\u2019s possession of\nH generates or conveys an entitlement for C over\nH. \u201c\u2019[J]ust steps, for Nozick, are human actions\nthat are free of injustice\u2026\u201d (Cohen 1995: 39). Consider\nCohen\u2019s example of D\u2019s rolling pin accidentally\nrolling downhill from D\u2019s kitchen into\nC\u2019s kitchen where C innocently mistakes it for\nhis long-lost rolling pin. Cohen thinks that, since nothing within\nthis transfer process is unjust, Nozick is committed to the transfer\nbeing just and entitlement conveying and, hence, is committed to the\nimplausible conclusion that C would acquire a just claim to\nthe rolling pin. Although this sort of criticism rests on the mistaken\nidea that, for Nozick, just processes are simply not unjust processes,\nit does highlight how little Nozick does offer in the way of a\npositive account of the nature and power of entitlement generating or\nconveying processes.\n\nNozick thinks we are pushed to adopt some set of historical\nentitlement principles by the dethronement of consequentialist\ndoctrines of justice in holdings; and he then implicitly relies on his\nreaders\u2019 intuitions about what the content of those principles\nwill be. Such intuitions will, e.g., count against the thought that\none can engage in the initial just acquisition of H by\nwanting H or by intensely focusing one\u2019s attention on\nH and will support the thought that some sort of physical\nengagement with unowned materials is necessary for acquiring an\nentitlement to them. Similarly, such intuitions will count against the\nthought that an accidental transfer of a rolling pin from\nD\u2019s kitchen to C\u2019s kitchen will convey\nthe right to the pin from D to C and will support\nthe thought that such a conveyance requires some sort of informed and\nvoluntary interaction between D and C.\n4.2 The Critique of End-State and Patterned Principles\n\nNozick discerns two types of principles concerning justice in holdings\nother than the historical entitlement type. These are end-state\nprinciples and patterned principles. To a considerable extent,\nNozick\u2019s argument on behalf of his historical entitlement\napproach consists in his critiques of end-state and patterned\ndoctrines. End-state principles hold that justice in the distribution\nof income (or economically valuable goods) is a matter of some\narithmetical feature of one of the available distributions. Consider\nthree available distributions of income among three individuals (or\namong three positions to be occupied by individuals):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA\nB\nC \n\nDistribution D1\n12\n10\n9 \n\nDistribution D2\n4\n22\n13 \n\nDistribution D3\n20\n8\n8  \n\n\nA utilitarian (or income maximization) theory will select\nD2 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nhas the greatest total income. An egalitarian theory will select\nD1 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nis the most equal distribution. Rawls\u2019 difference principle will\nselect D1 on the distinct ground that within it\nthe lowest payoff is greater than the lowest payoff within any other\navailable distribution. What makes each of these doctrines an\nend-state view is their shared conviction that the information\nprovided by this sort of matrix is sufficient for determining which of\nthe available distributions is the just one.\n\nAccording to Nozick, a major problem for all end-state doctrines is\nprecisely the falsity of this shared conviction. For surely\ninformation that cannot appear within such a matrix is essential to a\nsensible judgment about which of these available distributions is\njust. Consider, e.g., the following information.\nD2 is the distribution of income that obtains when\nA is enslaved to B who employs C as his\neffective overseer. D1 is the distribution that\nobtains when A is partially emancipated and is only subject\nto slavery-like exploitation by B and C one week per\nmonth. And D3 is the distribution that obtains\nwhen A is entirely emancipated. Given the obvious relevance\nof this sort of information for any responsible selection of one of\nthese distributions as the just one, any doctrine that asserts or\npresumes that the information available in the matrix suffices has to\nbe deeply flawed.\n\nPatterned theories of distributive justice escape this problem because\nthey hold that the just distribution is the available distribution in\nwhich the income accorded to individuals most tracks some feature of\nthose individuals\u2014e.g., their moral desert or their economic\neffort\u2014and the incidence of that feature is not reported in that\nincome matrix. Hence, one cannot say which of the distributions\npresented in the above table is to be selected until one also knows\nwhat the distribution of the to-be-tracked feature is among\nA, B, and C. In addition, plausible\npatterned doctrines will focus on features of individuals that are\nhistorical\u2014e.g., how much moral desert particular individuals\nhave amassed or how much economic effort they have evinced. So,\nplausible patterned doctrines will be historical. However, unlike\nhistorical entitlement doctrines, historical patterned theories will\nnot determine the justice of the particular holdings of individuals on\nthe basis of whether those individuals acquired those holdings through\nentitlement generating or conveying processes.\n\nNozick offers a series of arguments each of which is supposed to\ndiscredit all (non-trivial) end-state and patterned principles. (At\nthis point, Nozick employs the term \u201cpatterned\u201d to refer\nboth to end-state principles and track-the-feature principles.) We\nmust focus here on two of those arguments. The first, most famous, and\nmost misunderstood of these arguments appears in the section of\nASU that is entitled \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d (160\u2013164). The second appears in the section\nentitled \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d\n(167\u2013174).\n\nIn \u201cHow Liberty Upsets Patterns\u201d, Nozick asks each of his\nreaders to envision an income distribution that accords with her\nfavorite patterning principle. Then Nozick points out that more or\nless as soon as that pattern P1 is instituted,\nindividuals will engage in highly innocuous dispositions of what has\nbeen assigned to them in the name of justice that will engender a\ndifferent pattern P2. For instance, a million fans\nwill each pay Wilt Chamberlain 25 cents to see him play basketball.\nHowever, this new pattern P2 will almost certainly\nbe convertible through fine-tuned social engineering into another\npattern P3 that better realizes the favored\npatterning principle. Imagine, e.g., that the $250,000 that is\nconcentrated in Wilt\u2019s hands within P2 can\nbe effectively redistributed downward whereas it could not be\neffectively redistributed downward when it was still spread out among\nWilt\u2019s moderately prosperous fans. Thus, if we continue to\nassess distributions on the basis of the selected patterning\nprinciple, we will have to declare P2 to be unjust\nand maintain that justice requires its conversion into\nP3. And, more or less as soon as\nP3 is instituted, individuals will engage in\nhighly innocuous dispositions of what has just been assigned to them\nin the name of renewed justice that will engender a different pattern\nP4 \u2026 and so on. Nozick then identified two\nproblems with this continued application of the favored patterned\nrule.\n\nThis first problem is that, if (as stipulated) the holdings of\nindividuals under P1 were just and if (as\nstipulated) interactions that converted P1 into\nP2 were all just, it is difficult to see how\nP2 can become infected with injustice. Of course,\nP2 (almost certainly) must be judged to\nbe unjust if one continues to assess the justice of distributions on\nthe basis of the adopted patterned principle. But it seems reasonable\nto demand an explanation of how that asserted injustice could\nhave entered P2 given the justice of\nP1 and of the processes through which\nP2 emerges from P1.\n\n\nBy what process could such a transfer among two persons give rise to a\nlegitimate claim of distributive justice on a portion of what was\ntransferred, by a third party who has no claim of justice on any\nholding of the others before the transfer? (161\u20132)\n\n\nIt does not seem to be a sufficient answer to say that injustice must\nhave entered in P2 because, after all, when we\napply the operative distributive principle to P2\nwe reach the conclusion that P2 is unjust.\n\nThe second problem is that the endorsement of redistributive\ninterference with the outcomes of persons\u2019 innocuous deployments\nof their assigned holdings seems to be inconsistent with the justice\nof that assignment of holdings. For surely one may dispose as one\nchooses of one\u2019s just holdings as long as one does not unjustly\nimpinge upon others and their just holdings.\n\n\nIf the people were entitled to dispose of the resources to which they\nwere entitled (under D1), didn\u2019t this\ninclude their being entitled to give it to, or exchange it with Wilt\nChamberlain? (161)\n\n\nTo endorse redistributive interference with the outcomes of\npersons\u2019 non-impinging dispositions of the holdings that have\nbeen assigned to them seems to rescind the justice of that assignment\nof holdings.\n\n\nPatterned distributional principles do not give people what\nentitlement principles do, only better distributed. They do not give\nthe right to choose what to do with what one has\u2026 (167)\n\n\nThis aspect of Nozick\u2019s critique is nicely summed up in Hillel\nSteiner\u2019s quip that patterned theories of justice \u201ccreate\nrights to interfere with the rights that they have created\u201d\n(Steiner 1977:\n 43).[26]\n\nIt is important to note that the problems that Nozick\u2019s\nidentifies are problems internal to the ongoing application\nof any patterned principle. Nozick should not be read as making the\nquestion-begging external argument that, since conforming to liberty\nis the standard by which theories of justice in holdings should be\nassessed and patterned theories often call for interferences with\nliberty, patterned theories must be dismissed. Nevertheless, Nozick\nbears considerable responsibility for this reading when he says,\n\n\nThe general point\u2026 is that no end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continually\nrealized without continuous interference with people\u2019s lives.\n(163)\n\n\nNor should Nozick be pictured as holding that the problem with\npatterned theories is that they would forbid any departure from a\nP1 that is instituted because, at the time it is\ninstituted, it is the available distribution that best realizes some\nfavored pattern. Nozick is not charging patterning theorists with\nforbidding the exchange between Wilt and his fans.\n\nAn important response to Nozick\u2019s \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d arguments is that they rely upon a mistaken picture of\nthe patterned theorist\u2019s program. According to this response,\nNozick represents the patterned theorist as aiming at the daily (or\nweekly or monthly) fullest available realization of her favorite\npattern. On this representation, at the end of each day (or week or\nmonth) the advocate of, e.g., the Rawlsian difference principle will\ndetermine whether the existing distribution can be transformed into\none that provides a higher income for those in the lowest income\npositions for the next day (or week or month); if such a\ntransformation is available then (on this representation) the\ndifference principle advocate will require it as a matter of justice.\nHence, the continuous interference in the name of justice with the\nresults of people acting as they choose with their purported just\nholdings. However, the advocate of the difference principle will\nmaintain that this principle guides the design of the basic\ninstitutional structure of society; it provides the basic structure\nwith the aim of raising the lifetime income of the representative\nlowest income individual as much as possible. What is assigned to\nindividuals as a matter of distributive justice is a lifetime stream\nof income that arises through some combination of permitted and\nprotected modes of income acquisition, tax and regulatory structures,\nand tax-funded assistance. Wilt does not have a claim in justice to\nhis holdings on the day before the fans transfer $250,000 to him or to\nhis holdings on the following day. He has a claim in justice to the\nlifetime income that will accrue to him when a basic structure is in\nplace which, through enabling income acquisition, taxing, regulating,\nand subsidizing income yields (something like) the highest possible\nlifetime income for the least advantaged. That claim in justice is not\nviolated when the IRS seizes, say, 70% of his $250,000 windfall.\n\nHence, in his most direct response to Nozick\u2019s challenge, Rawls\ndeclares,\n\n\nThere are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences with\ncitizens\u2019 expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are\nearned, and honored as the public system declares. Taxes and\nrestrictions are all in principle foreseeable, and holdings\nare acquired on the known condition that certain transfers\nand redistributions will be made. (Rawls 1993: 283, emphasis\nadded)\n\n\nIt would seem, however, that Nozick can insist that any ongoing\nattempt to maximize lifetime incomes for the worst off (or to sustain\nany other non-trivial pattern) will require unannounced and\nunpredictable interferences with citizens\u2019 expectations and\nacquisitions. For, as economic preferences, needs, opportunities,\nbeliefs, insights, and capacities change in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways, the public system will similarly have to change if\nit is going to continue to aim at maximizing lifetime incomes for the\nworst off. And as further unannounced and unpredictable changes occur,\nthe basic structure will again have to be changed in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways. As Rawls himself says, \u201c\u2026 even in a\nwell-ordered society, adjustments in the basic structure are always\nnecessary\u201d (Rawls 1993: 284, Mack 2018: 124\u2013129). The\ninstitution of those adjustments will almost certainly have to\ndishonor some of the entitlements proclaimed under the previous public\nsystem and treat some of people\u2019s previously earned holdings to\npreviously unannounced and unpredictable transfers and redistributions\n(Mack 2002a, 85\u201391).\n\nIn \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d Nozick offers a\nmore external argument against all patterned theories of justice. The\nargument is that the institutional operation of any (non-trivial)\npatterned doctrine amounts to the institution of partial ownership of\nsome people by other people.\n\n\nWhether it is done through taxation on wages or on wages over a\ncertain amount, or through seizure of profits, or through there being\na big social pot so that it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s coming from\nwhere and what\u2019s going where, patterned principles of\ndistributive justice involve appropriating the actions of other\npersons. Seizing the results of someone\u2019s labor is equivalent to\nseizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various\nactivities\u2026 . This process \u2026 makes [those who carry it\nout] a part-owner of you; it gives them a property right in you. Just\nas having such partial control and power of decision, by right, over\nan animal or inanimate object would be to have a property right in it.\n(172)\n\n\nNozick distances himself from a Lockean labor-mixing account of just\ninitial holdings by jokingly asking whether one comes to own the ocean\nby pouring one\u2019s can of tomato juice into it (175). And, in the\npassage above, he carefully avoids saying that the operation of any\npatterned doctrine infringes upon one\u2019s self-ownership by way of\nappropriating one\u2019s labor.\n\nNevertheless, the argument in this passage seems to be quite Lockean\nin its basic structure. Rather than focusing on particular\nexpropriations of this or that labor infused object, the argument\nattends to the configuration of control over individuals\u2019\nactions, time, and decisions that the institution of any (non-trivial)\ndistributive pattern will require. According to Nozick, such a\nconfiguration of control wrongly treats the individuals who are\nsubject to it without their consent as though they are in part the\nproperty of those who establish and exercise that control. Note that\neven here Nozick does not seem to be proposing specific content for\nthe principles of just initial acquisition and just transfer. Rather,\nthe goal is to provide a general vindication of the historical\nentitlement approach by undercutting the end-state and patterned\napproaches.\n4.3 Nozick\u2019s Lockean Proviso\n\nNozick follows Locke in adopting a version of the claim that an\nindividual will have a complaint in justice against otherwise\nperfectly just acquisitions by others if those acquisitions do not\nleave that individual with \u201cenough, and as good\u201d\n(174\u2013182). Although Nozick\u2019s discussion of his Lockean\nproviso is somewhat murky, we can identify three important features of\nthat proviso doctrine.\n\nFirst, whether an individual has a complaint under Nozick\u2019s\nLockean proviso will not be a matter of whether too little natural\nmaterial has been left in common by others or too little material has\nbeen left for that individual to initially acquire. Rather, that\nindividual will have a just complaint against others\u2019\nacquisitions if and only if those acquisitions leave her on net worse\noff in terms of utility or welfare. The individual will have no just\ncomplaint even if her utility or welfare is diminished by a decrease\nin what remains in common or a decrease in what remains available for\nher initial acquisition as long as she is duly compensated in terms of\nutility or welfare by other effects of the acquisitive\nactions of others. The claim at the core of Nozick\u2019s\n\u201cenough, and as good\u201d proviso is only protected by a\nliability rule.\n\nSecond, in his main discussion of it, Nozick maintains that this\nproviso is readily satisfied in free market\n economies.[27]\n This is in part due to the strong tendency of the rising tide of such\neconomies to raise up all those who are willing to swim with it (177).\nIt is also in part due to the low baseline set by the proviso. Nozick\nnever carefully spells out that baseline. But it must be something\nlike how well off the individual under consideration would have been\nhad all natural stuff remained in the common or, perhaps, how well off\nthat individual would be (over his lifetime) were all natural stuff\n(or even all owned stuff) now returned to the common.\n\nThird, the proviso adds \u201can additional bit of complexity into\nthe structure of the entitlement theory\u201d (174). It specifies a\nway in which things could go especially badly for an individual even\nif the acquisitions of others are entirely in accord with the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and it asserts that individuals\nwould have a complaint in justice should things go that badly for them\nin that way. For Nozick, the primary case for the justice of any\nholding continues to turn on its having arisen through processes that\naccord with the principles of just initial acquisition, just transfer,\nand (if relevant) just rectification. (This is why it is such a\nserious problem that Nozick never spells out those principles and\nnever explains why acquisition in accordance with them has the power\nto engender or convey entitlements.) For Nozick, even if the proviso\nis violated, those who have acquired justly do not have to surrender\ntheir holdings\u2014albeit they need to provide compensation to those\nwhose situations are on net worsened by the existing system of\n holdings.[28]\n4.4 The Rectification of Historical Injustices\n\nNozick recognizes that even in relatively free societies the\nhistorical processes that have yielded existing holdings have been\nshot through with injustices. The history of almost all existing\nholdings includes lots of appropriation by way of murder, plunder,\nenslavement, fraudulent dealings, and other illicit coercive transfers\n(usually on behalf of the rich and powerful). We do not need a\ndelicately worked out theory of rectification in order to say that, if\nA has grabbed B\u2019s goat yesterday, he can be\nrequired to return it to B today. But we do need a highly\nelaborate theory to inform us about what rectification payments (if\nany) should now be required of whom on behalf of who else because of\ninjustices performed 20 or 50 or 200 years ago. Presumably any\nacceptable doctrine will require that only current victims of past\ninjustices have just claims to rectification payments and that they\nonly have just claims against current beneficiaries of those past\ninjustices. Perhaps, then, bygones should be treated as bygones when\nwe lack the information that a well-developed doctrine of\nrectification would require us to have to justly rectify long past\n injustices.[29]\n\nNozick closes chapter 7 with two thoughts concerning rectification.\nThe first is that proper rectification may have to take the form of\nrough and ready payments to classes of people whose members are likely\nto be worse off than they otherwise would be because of historical\ninjustices\u2014payments that would be funded by taxes upon classes\nof people whose members are likely to be better off than they\notherwise would be because of those historical injustices. The second\nis that some end-state principle might come into play as a guide for\nthese required payments\u2014albeit \u201cit may well be\nimplausible\u201d (231) to select the difference principle as this\nguide.\n5. Utopia\n\nThe official purpose of Part III of ASU,\n\u201cUtopia\u201d, is to show that the minimal state is not merely\nlegitimate and just; it is also inspiring. This purpose is advanced by\nsketching a framework for utopia that is inspiring and noting that\nthis framework is highly akin to\u2014Nozick actually says\n\u201cequivalent to\u201d (333)\u2014the minimal state. Yet Nozick\nalso says that the framework might not have any \u201ccentral\nauthority\u201d (329). Still, the framework is akin to the minimal\nstate because it is an institutional structure that enforces peaceful\nco-existence among voluntarily formed communities. It protects the\nindependence of such communities and their freedom to recruit members\nand also protects the liberty of individuals to enter and exit\ncommunities as they respectively choose. Although Nozick is not\nexplicit about this, we have to presume that the framework enforces\nthe same norms of personal freedom, property, and contractual\ncompliance that the minimal state enforces except insofar as\nindividuals voluntarily relinquish such rights within the communities\nthey enter.\n\nThe framework is inspiring because of the way it contributes to\npersons\u2019 identification of and participation in communities (and\nother networks of relationships) through which they will find meaning\nand well-being. It is inspiring to anyone who appreciates how little\neach of us knows about what sorts of communities best suit human\nbeings in all their depth and diversity and how much the operation of\nthe framework assists individuals in their discovery of and engagement\nin communities that enhance their respective well-being. Moreover,\nmany persons may value the framework not merely for the way it\nenhances their own good but, also, for the ways in which it allows\nthem to participate vicariously in others\u2019 achievement of their\ndifferent modes of flourishing (Lomasky 2002).\n5.1 The Framework as Discovery Procedure\n\nThe framework is\u2014or, more precisely, sustains\u2014a discovery\nprocedure. Under the protective umbrella of the framework, individuals\nare presented with and can try out diverse communities while\ncommunities themselves arise and modify themselves in their\ncompetitive search to sustain, improve, or increase their membership.\nA wide range of communities will continually arise out of and in\nresponse to the evolving perceptions that diverse individuals will\nhave about what modes of sociality will best suit them and will best\nattract welcome partners. Communities will survive and perhaps expand\nor be imitated insofar as they actually embody modes of relationship\nthat serve well their actual or prospective membership or insofar as\nthey successfully refine their offerings in the market place of\ncommunities. The framework also insures that those who are already\nconfident that they know what sort of community is best for them will\nbe free to form those communities by voluntary subscription and,\nthereby, to manifest their actual value (or disvalue) to themselves\nand to other seekers of well-being.\n\nPart of Nozick\u2019s sub-text here is a message to socialist\nutopians that nothing in the framework (or the minimal state)\nprecludes their non-coercive pursuit of their ideal communities. How,\ntherefore, can socialists object to the framework (or the minimal\nstate)? This generalizes Nozick\u2019s earlier claims in ASU\nthat that advocates of meaningful work and workers\u2019 control of\nproductive enterprises ought not to be hostile to the minimal state\nsince the minimal state is fully tolerant of non-coercive endeavors to\nestablish such conditions (246\u2013253).\n\nIn a short essay in Reason magazine published four years\nafter ASU, Nozick asked, \u201cWho Would Choose\nSocialism?\u201d (Nozick 1978). More precisely, his question was:\nWhat percent of the adult population would choose \u201cto\nparticipate in socialist interpersonal relations of equality and\ncommunity\u201d were they in position to choose between \u201ca\nreasonably attractive socialist option and also a reasonably\nattractive non-socialist one?\u201d (Nozick 1978: 277). Nozick takes\nthe choice available to Israelis between membership and non-membership\nin kibbutzim to be a good instance of a choice between such options\nand notes that around six percent of the adult population of Israel in\nthe 1970s had chosen the socialist option. He speculates that\nsocialists are at least \u201ctempted\u201d to be imperialists,\ni.e., to impose on everyone one their own vision of utopia, precisely\nbecause they sense that there will be too few volunteers (Nozick 1978:\n279).\n\nThe discovery procedure that the framework sustains is a version of\nMillian experiments in living\u2014albeit it is a version that places\nmuch more emphasis on the role of a marketplace of communities in\nproviding individuals with experimental options. This discovery\nprocedure (like Millian experiments in living) is, of course, a\nHayekian invisible hand process. Given the enormous diversity among\nindividuals, we do not know what one form of community would be\nbest.\n\n\nThe idea that there is one best composite answer to all of these\nquestions [about what features utopia has], one best society for\neveryone to live in, seems to me to be an incredible one. (And the\nidea that, if there is one, we now know enough to describe it is even\nmore incredible.) (311)\n\n\nNor do we know what distinct modes of community would be best for\ndistinct types of persons. Thus, we cannot design an inclusive utopia;\nnor can we design an array of mini-utopia such that some significantly\nfulfilling community will be available to everyone\u2014or even to\nmost.\n\n\nIt is helpful to imagine cavemen sitting together to think up what,\nfor all time, will be the best possible society and then setting out\nto institute it. Do none of the reasons that make you smile at this\napply to us? (313\u2013314)\n\n\nGiven our ignorance, the best way to realize utopia\u2014almost\ncertainly many distinct utopia\u2014is through the discovery\nprocedure that the framework sustains. (We should note, however, an\nimplicit, somewhat puzzling, and wholly unnecessary presupposition of\nNozick\u2019s discussion, viz, that individuals with utopian\naspirations will generally seek out communities that are made up of\nother individuals like themselves. The suggestion is that chosen\ncommunities will be internally homogeneous with heterogeneity existing\nonly across these communities.)\n5.2. An Independent Route to the Minimal State\n\nThe role of the framework in sustaining a discovery procedure brings\nus to the second main purpose of \u201cUtopia\u201d. This is the\nprovision of an independent vindication of the minimal state\u2014one\nthat specifically does not depend on \u201cthe moral arguments for\nindividual liberty\u201d (309 footnote*) offered in Parts I and II of\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia. Although the activities of the\nframework are described in terms of protecting the rights that are\naffirmed in early parts of the book, the utopian advocacy of the\nframework does not rely upon the validity of those rights. Rather,\nthat advocacy turns on a general endorsement of utopian aspiration\ncombined with the core epistemic claim that, given our ignorance, the\nonly sensible route to utopia is the discovery procedure that the\nframework sustains.\n\nThere is, however, an apparent problem with Nozick\u2019s\nindependence claim. Nozick distinguishes among three sorts of\nutopians. There are \u201cexistential utopians\u201d who have a\nparticular utopia in mind for themselves and others who will be drawn\nto it but have no problem with yet others being drawn to different\nutopia. There are \u201cmissionary utopians\u201d who hope \u201cto\npersuade or convince everyone to live in one particular kind of\ncommunity, but will not force them to do so\u201d. And there are\n\u201cimperialistic utopians\u201d who countenance \u201cthe\nforcing of everyone into one pattern of community\u201d\n(319\u2013320). While existential utopians will embrace the framework\nand missionary utopians will (less heartily) support it, imperialistic\n\u201cwill oppose the framework as long as some others do not agree\nwith them\u201d (320). Nozick\u2019s response to the imperialist is\nto say \u201cWell you can\u2019t satisfy everyone, especially if\nthere are those who will be dissatisfied unless not everybody is\nsatisfied\u201d (320). The suggestion\u2014never explicitly stated\nby Nozick\u2014is that the imperialist pursuit of utopia is to be\nsuppressed by the framework precisely because it is\nimpermissibly coercive. But, if so, the justification for\nthis crucial operation of the framework must appeal to some of\n\u201cthe moral arguments for individual liberty\u201d from which\nNozick wants his utopia argument to be independent.\n\nHowever, Nozick may be able to escape from this problem by emphasizing\nthat imperialists are being excluded on epistemic rather than moral\ngrounds. The question is, on what procedures will epistemically\nsensible utopians\u2014utopians with a due appreciation for the\ndifficulties involved in identifying and instituting\nutopia\u2014converge? And the answer is, on the processes of\nvoluntary association and dissociation and adjustment that the\nframework aims to sustain. Imperialist utopian coercion is simply not\npart of the process that all utopians have reason to favor because of\nits epistemic fecundity. Moreover, the operation of the framework does\nnot preclude the establishment\u2014for some people or for\nall\u2014of the mode of community favored by any\nutopian.\n\n\nSince any particular community may be established within the\nframework, it is compatible with all particular utopian visions, while\nguaranteeing none. (320)\n\n\nAny utopian who wants her (current) vision to be guaranteed by being\nforced upon others has good epistemic reasons to shed that desire.\n\nStill, it might be maintained that the most informative discovery\nprocedure is one that embodies no-holds-barred competition among\ncommunities. For surely we want to know which communities or\nassociations of communities, if any, will be capable of defending\nthemselves against the imperialists. Since it seems that the most\ninformative discovery procedure would not exclude imperialist\nutopians, it seems that the real basis for the exclusion of\nimperialists must be moral. Hence, it appears that their exclusion\ndoes undercut Nozick\u2019s goal of providing an independent\nvindication of the minimal state.\n\nHowever, this problem also may be just a matter of appearance. After\nall, the framework proposed by Nozick does not exclude imperialists in\nthe sense of stipulating their non-existence. Rather, one of the core\nroles of the framework is precisely to protect non-imperialists and\ntheir voluntary modes of association and dissociation from those\nepistemically short-sighted, albeit still existing, imperialists. The\noperation of the framework should, therefore, be seen as a two-level\ndiscovery procedure. On one level it operates as Nozick explicitly\ndescribes\u2014as a competitive market place of communities serving\nindividuals who are becoming more informed about their taste for\ncommunity. However, on another level, the operation of the framework\nis a procedure through which non-imperialist communities and\nnon-imperialist individuals who do not enter any utopian community\ndiscover how, if at all, they can cooperate in maintaining and\noperating the framework so as to protect themselves and their\nepistemic quest from the imperialists.\n",
