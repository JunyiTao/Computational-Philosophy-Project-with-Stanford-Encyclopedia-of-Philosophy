Federations tend to drift\ntoward disintegration in the form of secession, or toward\ncentralization in the direction of a unitary state.\n\nSuch instability should come as no surprise given the tensions\ntypically giving rise to federal political orders in the first place,\nsuch as tensions between majority and minority national communities in\nmultinational federations. Federal political orders are therefore\noften marked by a high level of \u2018constitutional\ncontestation\u2019. The details of their constitutions and other\ninstitutions may affect these conflicts and their outcomes in drastic\nways. Political parties often disagree on constitutional issues\nregarding the appropriate areas of member unit autonomy, the forms of\ncooperation and how to prevent fragmentation. Such sampling bias among\nstates that federalize to hold together makes it difficult to assess\noften heard claims that federal responses such as granting some local\nautonomy perpetuate cleavages and fuel rather than quell secessionist\nmovements. Some nevertheless argue that democratic, interlocking\nfederations alleviate such tendencies (Simeon 1998, Simeon and Conway\n2001, Linz 1997; cf. McKay 2001, Filippov, Ordeshook and Shvetsova\n2004).\n\nMany authors note that the challenges of stability must be addressed\nnot only by institutional design, but also by ensuring that citizens\nhave an \u2018overarching loyalty\u2019 or \u2018federal\nspirit\u2019 to the federation as whole in addition to loyalty toward\ntheir own member unit (Franck 1968, Linz 1997, Burgess 2012). The\nlegitimate bases, content and division of such a public dual\nallegiance are central topics of political philosophies of federalism\n(Norman 1995a, Choudhry 2001). Some accept (limited) appeals to\nconsiderations such as shared history, practices, culture, or\nethnicity for delineating member units and placing certain powers with\nthem, even if such \u2018communitarian\u2019 features are regarded\nas more problematic bases for (unitary) political orders (Kymlicka\n1995, Habermas 1996, 500). Debates about the existence of a\n\u2018European demos\u2019 and the need for a common \u2018European\nidentity\u2019 merit more careful scrutiny (Habermas 1992). The\nappropriate consideration that voters and their member unit\npoliticians should give to the interests of others in the federation\nin interlocking arrangements must be clarified if the notion of\ncitizen of two commonwealths is to be coherent and durable. Several of\nthese challenges are especially acute for \u2018ethnic\nfederalism\u2019 when the member units are delineated along ethnic\nlines: Any \u2018internal minorities\u2019 of other ethnicity risk\npersecution, the prospects of an overarching loyalty are dimmer, and\nethnic nationalism may fuel secessionist movements (Selassie 2003)\n",
