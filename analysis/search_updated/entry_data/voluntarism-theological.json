    "preamble": "\n\nThere is a class of metaethical and normative views that commonly goes\nby the name \u2018divine command theory.\u2019 What all members of\nthis class have in common is that they hold that what God wills is\nrelevant to determining the moral status of some set of entities\n(acts, states of affairs, character traits, etc., or some combination\nof these). But the name \u2018divine command theory\u2019 is a bit\nmisleading: what these views have in common is their appeal to the\ndivine will; while many of these views hold that the relevant act of\ndivine will is that of commanding, some deny it. So we would do well\nto have a label for this class of views that does not prejudge the\nissue of the relevant act of divine will. The label that I will use,\nfollowing Quinn 1990, is \u2018theological voluntarism.\u2019\n\nI have three aims in this article. I want first to distinguish\nmetaethical versions of theological voluntarism from normative\nversions of that view, putting to the side normative versions. Second,\nI will say something about the main lines of defense of theological\nvoluntarism, the various theoretical options that confront defenders\nof theological voluntarism, and some of the reasons for affirming or\nrejecting these different possible formulations. And finally I will\nsay a bit about the sort of difficulties that seem to confront any\nsuch views. (I do not, however, give an account of the history of\ntheological voluntarism in moral philosophy; for an anthology of\nreadings covering a broad swath of this history, see Idziak 1979.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Metaethical and normative theological voluntarism\n\nTo be a theological voluntarist with respect to some moral status is\nto hold that entities have that status in virtue of some act of divine\nwill. But some instances of this view are metaethical theses; some\ninstances of it are normative theses.\n\nConsider, for example, theological voluntarism about the status of\nacts as obligatory or non-obligatory. One might hold that there is a\nsingle supreme obligation, the obligation to obey God. Every\nparticular type of act that one might perform thus has its moral\nstatus as obligatory or non-obligatory in virtue of God\u2019s having\ncommanded the performance of acts of that type or God\u2019s not\nhaving commanded acts of that type. This is a common version of divine\ncommand theory, according to which all of the more workaday\nobligations that we are under (not to steal from each other, not to\nmurder each other, to help each other out when it would not be\ninconvenient, etc.) bind us as a result of the exercise of God\u2019s\nsupreme practical authority.\n\nThe view just described is a version of normative theological\nvoluntarism. It is a normative view because it asserts that some\nnormative state of affairs obtains\u2014namely, the normative state\nof affairs its being obligatory to obey God. And it is a\nversion of theological voluntarism because it holds that all other\nnormative states of affairs, at least those involving obligation,\nobtain in virtue of God\u2019s commanding activity.\n\nMetaethical theological voluntarism, by contrast, does not assert the\nobtaining of any normative state of affairs. (For a contrary view, see\nHeathwood 2012, p. 7.) It is possible for one to be a metaethical\ntheological voluntarist and to hold that no normative states of\naffairs obtain. Rather, metaethical theological voluntarists aim to\nsay something interesting and informative about moral concepts,\nproperties, or states of affairs; and they want to say something\ninteresting and informative about them by connecting them to acts of\nthe divine will. Metaethical theological voluntarists might claim that\n(e.g.) obligation is a theological concept, or that the property of\nbeing obligatory is a theological property, or that obligations are\ncaused immediately by the divine will. But note that none of these\nviews asserts that there are any obligations.\n1.1 Theological voluntarism and theism\n\nOne does not have to be a theist in order to be a theological\nvoluntarist. One can affirm normative theological voluntarism or\nmetaethical theological voluntarism while failing to affirm theism;\natheists and agnostics can be theological voluntarists of either\nstripe. With respect to normative theological voluntarism: one might\nclaim that while it is true that any being that merits the title of\n\u2018God\u2019 merits obedience, we should not believe that there\nis such a being. (Compare: if, through some glitch in promotions,\nthere happened to be no lieutenants in the army at some time, it would\nnot cease to be true that privates ought to obey lieutenants. One\ncould believe that that there are no lieutenants while believing that\nprivates ought to obey their lieutenants.) With respect to metaethical\ntheological voluntarism: one might claim that, for example, the\nconcept of obligation is ineliminably theistic, though there is no\nGod; that God does not exist counts not against metaethical\ntheological voluntarism but rather against the claim that the concept\nof obligation has application. (Compare: one might believe that\n\u2018sin\u2019 is properly defined as \u2018offense against\nGod.\u2019 One can clearly affirm this definition while rejecting\nGod\u2019s existence; all that one is committed to thereby is that\nthere really are no sins.)\n1.2 Theological voluntarism and moral skepticism\n\nCall a \u2018moral skeptic\u2019 one who disbelieves or withholds\njudgment on the claim that any normative state of affairs obtains. One\ncan affirm metaethical theological voluntarism while being a moral\nskeptic; one cannot affirm normative theological voluntarism while\nbeing a moral skeptic. A metaethical theological voluntarist might\nclaim that no normative state of affairs could be made to obtain\nwithout certain acts of divine will, but because there is no God, or\nbecause there is a God that has not performed the requisite acts of\nwill, no normative states of affairs obtain. A normative theological\nvoluntarist cannot, however, be a moral skeptic. Because the normative\ntheological voluntarist is committed to the obtaining of at least one\nnormative state of affairs\u2014for example, its being obligatory\nto obey God\u2014the conjunction of moral skepticism and\nnormative theological voluntarism is not a coherent combination of\nviews.\n\nMy concern in the rest of this article will be with the metaethical\nversion of theological voluntarism; any further references to\ntheological voluntarism are, unless otherwise noted, to the\nmetaethical version of the position. Theological voluntarism thus\nunderstood is consistent either with the affirmation or with the\ndenial of theism and moral skepticism. Taking a negative stand on\ntheism or a positive stand on moral skepticism should not prevent one\nfrom taking seriously theological voluntarism as a philosophical\nposition. This is an important point, because it is often thought that\ntheological voluntarism is only for theists, or only for moral\nnonskeptics. While it is true that some of the arguments for\ntheological voluntarism take theism, or the existence of moral\nobligations, as premises, not all of them do. \n2. Metaethical theological voluntarism\n\nMetaethics is concerned with the formulation of interesting and\ninformative accounts of normative concepts, properties, and states of\naffairs; and a metaethics that is a version of theological voluntarism\nwill formulate such accounts in terms of some acts of divine will.\nThis statement of the position is highly abstract, but it cannot be\nmade less abstract without making difficult choices among rival\nformulations of the view.\n2.1 Considerations in Favor\n\nThe considerations to be offered in favor of theological voluntarism\nare, at this level, similarly abstract. I will discuss three types of\nconsideration: historical, theological, and\nmetaethical.\nHistorical considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nSome of the considerations in favor of metaethical theological\nvoluntarism are historical. Both theists and nontheists have been\nimpressed by the extent to which at least some moral concepts\ndeveloped in tandem with theological concepts, and it may therefore be\nthe case that there could be no adequate explication of some moral\nconcepts without appeal to theological ones. On this view, it is not\nmerely historical accident that at least some moral concepts had their\norigin in contexts of theistic belief and practice; rather, these\nconcepts have their origin essentially in such contexts, and become\ndistorted and unintelligible when exported from those contexts (see,\nfor example, Anscombe 1958).\nTheological considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nSome of the considerations in favor of theological voluntarism have\ntheir source in matters regarding the divine nature. Several such\narguments are summarized in Idziak 1979 (pp. 8\u201310). Some appeal\nto omnipotence: since God is both omnipotent and impeccable,\ntheological voluntarism must be true: for if God cannot act in a way\nthat is morally wrong, then God\u2019s power would be limited by\nother normative states of affairs were theological voluntarism not the\ncase. Some appeal to God\u2019s freedom: since God is free\nand impeccable, theological voluntarism must be true: for if moral\nrequirements existed prior to God\u2019s willing them, requirements\nthat an impeccable God could not violate, God\u2019s liberty would be\ncompromised. Some appeal to God\u2019s status as supremely\nlovable and deserving of allegiance: if theism is\ntrue, then the world of value must be a theocentric one, and so any\nmoral view that does not place God at its center is bound to be\ninadequate. Even if individually insufficient as justifications for\nadopting theological voluntarism, collectively they may suggest some\ndesiderata for a moral view: that God must be at the center of a moral\ntheory, and, in particular, that the realm of the moral must be\ndependent on God\u2019s free choices. It seems that any moral theory\nthat met these desiderata would count as a version of theological\nvoluntarism.\nMetaethical considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nA third set of considerations in favor of theological voluntarism has\nits source in metaethics proper, in the attempt to provide adequate\nphilosophical accounts of the various formal features exhibited by\nmoral concepts, properties, and states of affairs. One might claim,\nthat is, that theological voluntarism makes the best sense of the\nformal features of morality that both theists and nontheists\nacknowledge.\n\nConsider first the normativity of morals. Both theists and\nnontheists have been impressed by the weirdness of normativity, with\nits very otherness, and have thought that whatever we say about\nnormativity, it will have to be a story not about natural properties\nbut nonnatural ones (cf. Moore 1903, section 13). John Mackie, an\natheist, and George Mavrodes, a theist, have both drawn from this the\nsame moral: if there is a God, then the normativity of morality can be\nunderstood in theistic terms; otherwise, the normativity of morality\nis unintelligible (Mavrodes 1986; Mackie 1977, p. 48). As Robert Adams\nhas suggested, given the serious difficulties present in understanding\nmoral properties as natural properties, it is worthwhile taking\nseriously the hypothesis that morality is not just a nonnatural matter\nbut a supernatural one (Adams 1973, p. 105). For the standard\nobjections against understanding normativity as a nonnatural property\nconcern our inability to say anything further about that nonnatural\nproperty itself and about our ability to grasp that property (see,\ne.g., M. Smith 1994, pp. 21\u201325). But if morality is to be\nunderstood in terms of God\u2019s commands, we can give an\ninformative account of what these unusual properties are; and if it is\nunderstood in terms of God\u2019s commands, then we can give an\ninformative account of how God, being the creator and sustainer of us\nrational beings, can ensure that we can have an adequate epistemic\ngrasp of the moral domain (Adams 1979a, pp. 137\u2013138).\n\nConsider next the impartiality of morals. The domain of the\nmoral, unlike the domain of value generally, is governed by the\nrequirements of impartiality. To use Sidgwick\u2019s phrase, the\npoint of view of morality is not one\u2019s personal point of view\nbut rather \u201cthe point of view \u2026 of the Universe\u201d\n(Sidgwick 1907, p. 382). But, to remark on the perfectly obvious, the\nUniverse does not have a point of view. Various writers have employed\nfictions to try to provide some sense to this idea: Adam Smith\u2019s\nimpartial and benevolent spectator, Firth\u2019s ideal observer, and\nRawls\u2019 contractors who see the world sub specie\naeternitatis come to mind most immediately (Smith 1759, Pt III,\nCh 8; Firth 1958; and Rawls 1971, p. 587). But theological voluntarism\ncan provide a straightforward understanding of the impartiality of\nmorals by appealing to the claim that the demands of morality arise\nfrom the demands of someone who in fact has an impartial and supremely\ndeep love for all of the beings that are morality\u2019s proper\nobjects.\n\nConsider next the overridingness of morals. The domain of the\nmoral, it is commonly thought, consists in a range of values that can\ndemand absolute allegiance, in the sense that it is never reasonable\nto act contrary to what those values finally require. One deep\ndifficulty with this view, formulated in a number of ways but perhaps\nmost memorably by Sidgwick (1907, pp. 497\u2013509), is that it is\nhard to see how moral value automatically trumps other kinds of value\n(e.g. prudential value) when they conflict. But if the domain of the\nmoral is to be understood in terms of the will of a being who can make\nit possible that, or even ensure that, the balance of reasons is\nalways in favor of acting in accordance with the moral demand, then\nthe overridingness of morals becomes far easier to explain (Layman\n2006; Evans 2013, pp. 29\u201330).\n\nConsider next the content of morals. There is a strong case\nto be made that moral judgments cannot have just any content: they\nmust be concerned, somehow, with what exhibits respect for certain\nbeings, or with what promotes their interests (cf. Foot 1958, pp.\n510\u2013512; M. Smith 1994, p. 40; Cuneo & Shafer-Landau 2014,\npp. 404\u2013407). Theological voluntarism has a ready explanation\nfor the content of morals being what it is: it is that moral demands\narise from a being that loves that being\u2019s creation.\n\nSo there are some general reasons to think theological voluntarism\npromising. The reasons are stronger yet when one is proceeding from\ntheistic starting points. (This is not trivial, since a number of\ntheistic philosophers reject theological voluntarism.) But these\nreasons, while suggestive, are rather generic: they point to the\npromise possessed by theological voluntarism, though they do not fix\nfor us on a particular formulation of the view. The general schema for\na particular theological voluntarist position is \u2018evaluative\nstatus M stands in dependence relation D to divine\nact A\u2019 (cf. Quinn 1999, p. 53, which I follow here\nexcept to substitute the more general \u2018evaluative\u2019 for\nQuinn\u2019s more specific \u2018moral\u2019). So there are at\nleast three choices that have to be made. We need to say something\nabout\n what sorts of evaluative statuses\n depend on God\u2019s will. We need to say something about what are\nthe\n relevant acts of divine will.\n And we need to say something about what the\n dependence relation\n is supposed to be. (These are not independent questions, of\ncourse.)\n2.2 Which evaluative statuses?\n\nA metaethical view can be more or less comprehensive, aiming to cover\nmore or fewer evaluative statuses. A metaethical view might claim to\nprovide an account of all evaluative notions, or of all normative\nnotions, or of all moral notions, or or some set of moral notions.\n(Roughly, and taking the notion of an evaluative property as\nfundamental: for a notion to be normative is for it to be a certain\nsort of evaluative notion, one that is essentially action-guiding; for\na notion to be moral is for it to be a certain sort of normative\nnotion, one that exhibits impartiality.) No one claims that\ntheological voluntarism provides an account of all evaluative notions.\nThe real contenders are the latter three.\n\nThere are good reasons to reject the claim that all normative notions\nare to be understood in relation to God\u2019s will. The main reason\nis that, as we will see below, it is important that there be items\nwith normative statuses independent of God\u2019s will in order to\nexplain how God\u2019s will, even if free, is not arbitrary. And it\nis not as if the view that some normative statuses are not to be\nexplained in terms of God\u2019s will must be repugnant to a\ntheocentric metaethics: for, after all, one might understand such\nstatuses in theological, even if not voluntaristic, terms. Adams, for\nexample, understands some notions of goodness in terms of likeness to\nGod, an understanding that is unquestionably theocentric though not\nvoluntaristic (Adams 1999, pp. 28\u201338; also Murphy 2011, pp.\n148\u2013160).\n\nMost of the current debate over the evaluative statuses to be\nexplained by theological voluntarism, then, concerns whether the\nentire set or only some proper subset of moral statuses is to be\nunderstood in both theological and voluntaristic terms. Quinn\u2019s\n1978 work offers a theological voluntarist view on which all moral\nstatuses are to be understood in terms of God\u2019s will. But Adams\nrejects this view, and Quinn, following Adams and Alston (1990),\neventually rejected it as well. These writers hold that only moral\nproperties in the \u201cobligation family,\u201d properties like\nthose of being obligatory, being permissible,\nbeing required, and being right (where being\nright involves a constraint on conduct, rather than being merely\nfitting), are to be understood in theological voluntarist terms. Call\ntheir view the restricted moral view; call the view that all\nmoral statuses are to be understood in voluntarist terms the\nunrestricted moral view.\n\nThe restricted moral view has been defended with more and less\nimpressive arguments. (See Murphy 2012.) The less impressive arguments\nare those that appeal to the idea that there must be moral properties\nthat are not explained in terms of God\u2019s will in order to deal\nwith some of the classic objections to theological voluntarism. To\npreserve the notion that God is good, one might say, we need to\nrestrict the aspirations of theological voluntarism to those of\nexplaining a proper subset of moral notions, leaving the remainder for\nan account of God\u2019s goodness; or, to make intelligible the\ncommands that God chooses to give, we need to set aside some group of\nmoral notions to be explained in other than theological voluntarist\nterms and that can therefore enter into our account of the\nintelligibility of God\u2019s choices to give certain commands rather\nthan others. But these considerations are not, after all, entirely\npersuasive. For one might well explain the notion that God is good and\naccount for the intelligibility of divine commands by appeal to\nnormative notions that are nonmoral. (See Section 3\n below\n for further discussion of these arguments.)\n\nMore plausible are arguments that suggest that there is something in\nparticular about obligation that makes it fit for a theological\nvoluntarist explanation, some feature that is not shared with notions\nlike moral virtue and moral good. Adams suggests, with some\nplausibility, that the notion of obligation is ineliminably social,\nthat it must involve a relationship between persons, a relationship in\nwhich a demand is made (Adams 1987b, p. 264; also Adams 1999, pp.\n245\u2013246; for a nontheistic view defending a similar position,\nsee Darwall 2006). This feature of obligation makes it different from\nnotions of goodness and virtue, which do not seem to have this\nessentially social element. That obligation is special in this way\ndoes not, of course, show that notions of moral virtue and moral\ngoodness do not also need to be treated in a theological voluntarist\nway. It could be that even if obligation most obviously requires this\ntreatment, the points made earlier about the promise of theological\nvoluntarism also extend to other moral notions, even if in a less\npressing way. (See\n Section 3.3\n for further discussion, and evaluation, of this point.)\n\nThere are no obviously decisive reasons for the theological\nvoluntarist to adhere to either the restricted or the unrestricted\nmoral view. (For a set of arguments that the restricted theological\nvoluntarists have failed to avoid objections to theological\nvoluntarism while leaving the positive arguments for the view intact,\nsee Murphy 2012.) But theological voluntarists have wanted to say at\nleast that the properties in the obligation family are to be accounted\nfor in terms of this view. In the remainder of this article, it will\nbe assumed that theological voluntarism is about properties in the\nobligation family, though we will occasionally consider how the view\ncould be extended to other moral properties as well. \n2.3 Which act of divine will?\n\nAssume, then, that theological voluntarism is an account of\nobligation-type properties. A second issue concerning the proper\nformulation of the view concerns the relevant act of divine will. Is\nthe requisite act of divine will to be understood as an act of\ncommanding, or instead as some mental act like choosing, intending,\npreferring, or wishing? And if one holds that the act of the divine\nwill is a mental act, should the mental act to which the theological\nvoluntarist appeals in order to account for obligation be one whose\nobject is the action that is made obligatory, or one whose object is\nthe state of affairs that the action is obligatory? We have, to\nsimplify matters, three options:\n\n(1)\n\nThat it is obligatory for A to \u03c6 depends on God\u2019s\ncommanding A to \u03c6.\n(2)\n\nThat it is obligatory for A to \u03c6 depends on God\u2019s\nwilling that A \u03c6.\n(3)\n\nThat it is obligatory for A to \u03c6 depends on God\u2019s\nwilling that it be obligatory for A to \u03c6.\n\n\nOne might think that the central issue here would be to decide between\nthe speech-act view (1) and the mental acts views (2) and (3); it\nmight be thought to be less important, an issue of intramural interest\nonly, to decide between (2) and (3). But this is not right. The\nimportant debate is between (1) and (2). For (3) is, understood in one\nway, no competitor with either (1) or (2); and understood differently,\nit has little argumentative support.\nThe dispute between (1) and (2)\n\nThere is an ongoing debate whether (1) or (2) is the better\nformulation of theological voluntarism about obligation. There are\ninitially plausible points on both sides of the issue. In favor of\n(1), one might appeal to the centrality of the image of God as\ncommander in the Abrahamic faiths. In favor of (2), one might appeal to\nthe centrality to theistic belief and practice of the idea that doing\nGod\u2019s will is the standard for the moral life.\n\nWith only these initial points, there can be no resolution, and so\ndefenders of these two formulations of theological voluntarism have\nsought other argumentative routes. One might try to reduce (2) to\nabsurdity. One who is rational does not intend what one knows will not\nhappen; and, on the orthodox conception of God, God is both rational\nand omniscient. This entails that God will never intend something that\nwill not happen. If obligation arises from divine intentions, though,\nthen no obligations will ever be violated. Since this is absurd, one\nshould prefer (1) over (2). But defenders of (2) have a plausible\nresponse. First, defenders of (1) are in no better a position than\ndefenders of (2). For it is a sincerity condition on the giving of\ncommands that the commander intend that the commanded perform the\naction; and so if this objection reduces (2) to absurdity, the only\nway that the defender of (1) can avoid having his or her position\nreduced to absurdity is by holding that God is not necessarily\nsincere. Second, the notion of intention admits of various readings,\nand there is a reading of intention suitable for theological\nvoluntarism that does not have the untoward result that no created\nrational beings could ever act contrary to a divine intention. It is\nstandard to distinguish between God\u2019s antecedent and\nGod\u2019s consequent will: God\u2019s consequent will is\nGod\u2019s will absolutely considered, as bearing on all actual\ncircumstances; God\u2019s antecedent will is God\u2019s will\nconsidered with respect to some proper subset of actual circumstances.\n(To use an example of Aquinas\u2019s, one drawn from the discussion\nin which the distinction between antecedent and consequent will is\nmade [Summa Theologiae, Ia, Q. 19, A. 6]: while in one way\nGod wills that all persons be saved, in another way God does not will\nthat all be saved; indeed, God wills that some persons be damned. What\nmakes this coherent is that the sense of willing in which God wills\nthat all be saved is antecedent: prior to a consideration of all of\nthe particulars of persons\u2019 situations, God wills their\nsalvation; but in light of all of the particulars of persons\u2019\nsituations\u2014including the circumstance that some persons have\nwillingly rejected friendship with God\u2014God wills their\ndamnation.) So while there is a sense in which it is true that all\nthat God intends must come to pass, this sense is that of consequent\nintending rather than antecedent intending. On (2), then, one can say\nthat the theological voluntarist holds that obligation depends on\ncertain of God\u2019s antecedent intentions. (See also\nMurphy 1998, pp. 17\u201321.)\n\nWe might ask, in order to bring the differences between these views\nbetter out into the light, what our considered opinion is in cases in\nwhich a divine antecedent intention that A \u03c6 and a divine\ncommand that A \u03c6 pull apart. It is far from clear that it\nis a real option for God to command that A \u03c6 while not\nintending that A \u03c6. Though this possibility is endorsed\nby Wierenga 1983 (p. 390) and is at least entertained in Murphy 1998\n(p. 9), for God to issue such a command would be for God to command\ninsincerely\u2014something that many would be loath to allow. (See\nalso Adams 1999, p. 260 and Murphy 2002, 2.5). But the other option\nappears unproblematic enough. God might intend for humans to act a\ncertain way while not commanding them to do so. In such a scenario,\none might ask, is obligation engendered? If yes, then it seems to\ncount in favor of the divine will view (2); if no, then it seems to\ncount in favor of the divine command view (1).\n\nAdams claims that obligations are not engendered in such cases;\nactually made demands are necessary. He offers three reasons for\npreferring the command conception in these cases. The first is that\nholding that obligation is a matter of divine command rather than\ndivine will makes possible a distinction between the obligatory and\nthe supererogatory: we can say that while God\u2019s commands somehow\nmakes certain acts obligatory, if God does will that we perform some\nact but does not command it, performing that act is supererogatory.\nThe second is an appeal to the idea that theological voluntarism is a\nsocial conception of obligation: obligation arises in the context of\nthe social relationship between God and created rational beings. (Not\nall versions of theological voluntarism affirm this; see the\ndiscussion of (3) below.) But, Adams says, in social relationships\nobligations arise only when demands are actually made. And the third\nreason is that there is something unsavory about obligations allegedly\nresulting from an act of divine will that is not expressed as a\ncommand: \u201cGames in which one party incurs guilt for failing to\nguess the unexpressed wishes of the other party are not nice games.\nThey are no nicer if God is thought of as a party to them\u201d\n(Adams 1999, p. 261).\n\nBut the defender of the divine will view (2) has some responses\navailable. The defender of this view can say, with respect to the\nfirst point, that a divine will view can capture the difference\nbetween the obligatory and the supererogatory not by appeal to the\ndifference between acts of divine will that are expressed as commands\nand those that are not but rather as a difference between distinct\ntypes of act of divine will: the difference, say, between what God\nintends that we do and what God merely prefers that we do (cf. Quinn\n1999, p. 56). Or, in the alternative, the distinction can be made\nwithin the divine will: one might characterize as obligatory those\nactions that God wills that one perform, and as supererogatory those\nactions that God wills that one perform if one is willing to do\nso, so that if one performs the action, one is doing what God\nwills, but if one does not, one is not doing what God wills that one\nnot do. With respect to the second and third points, the defender of\nthe divine will view can directly challenge Adams\u2019 view that\nobligations generated within social relationships must always be\nexpressed as demands. Spouses, for example, often take themselves to\nbe obligated by what their spouses intend with respect to their\nbehavior; indeed, it would be unseemly to hold oneself to be bound by\none\u2019s spouse\u2019s will only if the spouse has actually made a\ndemand on one. (\u201cHow can you blame me for not helping you empty\nthe dishwasher? You didn\u2019t tell me to!\u201d does not often go\nover well.) One often wants another to perform some action without\nbeing told to; many actions have their value only through being\nperformed without being prompted by a command. But, on (1), no act of\nthe form \u2018\u03c6-ing, though God has not told me to\n\u03c6\u2019 could ever be obligatory.\n\nHere is a thought experiment that may help to decide the dispute\nbetween these two camps. For it to be possible for one to give another\na command to \u03c6, there must be a linguistic practice available to\nthe addressee in terms of which the speaker can formulate a command.\nThis is not just for the sake of having the means to communicate a\ncommand: rather, commands are essentially linguistic items, and cannot\nbe defined except in such terms. Imagine, though, that a certain\ncreated rational being, Mary, inhabits a linguistic community in which\nthere is no practice of commanding. One can successfully make\nassertions to Mary, and among these assertions can be assertions about\none\u2019s own psychological states, but one cannot successfully\ncommand Mary to do anything. Here is the question: so long as\nMary\u2019s linguistic resources are confined to those afforded by\nthis practice, can God impose obligations on her? The defender of (1)\nwill have to say No: for Mary cannot be commanded to do anything. The\ndefender of (2) will have to say Yes: God could have an antecedent\nintention that Mary perform some action and (to sidestep worries about\nbeing under an obligation that one cannot know about) could inform\nMary that God has that intention with respect to her conduct.\n\nThe debate between defenders of (1) and defenders of (2) is ongoing,\nand at present far from conclusive. (For some recent interventions\ninto this debate, see Mann 2005b, Miller 2009a, and Jordan 2012.)\nOption (3)\n\nThe other formulation of theological voluntarism that we noted is that\nin which the act of divine will is that of willing that the state of\naffairs that it is obligatory for A to \u03c6 obtain. Unlike\nthe formulations (1) and (2), which admit of various sorts of\ndependence relationship between the act of divine will and the\nobligation, (3) is limited to something like a causal picture. (It\nobviously could not be that its being obligatory for A to\n\u03c6 is identical to God\u2019s willing that it be\nobligatory for A to \u03c6, on pain of a vicious regress.) The\nidea expressed here is that ultimately all obligations are present\nbecause of efficacious acts of the divine will, in particular, acts of\nwilling that those obligations be in force.\n\nThis account is compatible with (1) and (2), because it could be that\nthe way that God makes it the case that an act is obligatory is\nnecessarily through the giving of commands (as in (1)) or through\nantecedently intending (as in (2)) the performance of that action. So\nit is not really, in its most general form, a competitor to\n(1) and (2). It could be made a competitor by adding claims about the\nway that the divine will brings it about that these obligations\nobtain. A defender of (3) might add that on his or her view the divine\nintention that A be obligated to \u03c6 is the immediate,\ntotal, and exclusive cause of its being obligatory for A to\n\u03c6 (cf. Quinn 1999, p. 55). If so, then a divine command that\nA \u03c6 or a divine antecedent intention that A\n\u03c6 could not be partial or mediate causes of its being obligatory\nfor A to \u03c6. But note that even thus strengthened (3) is\ncompatible with (1) or (2) understood as an identity claim: if the\nclaim is that obligations just are divine commands or divine\nintentions, then the compatibility with (1) and (2) is\nreestablished.\n\nEven if it turns out that (3) is not an obvious competitor with (1)\nand (2), it is still worth asking whether it is true. Though Quinn\neventually rejected (3), at one point he argued for it by appeal to\ndivine sovereignty: because every state of affairs that obtains\nthat does not involve God\u2019s existing depends on God\u2019s\nwill, a fortiori every normative state of affairs that does not\ninvolve God\u2019s existing depends on God\u2019s will. (Quinn\nthought that its being obligatory to obey God is a state of\naffairs that involves God\u2019s existing [Quinn 1990, pp.\n298\u2013299], but for a reason to reject that claim see Murphy 1998,\npp. 12\u201313.) It does not seem, though, that this argument would\nsupport (3) in the strengthened version that holds that the dependence\nmust be immediate, total, and exclusive. After all, very few folks\nwant to say that every state of affairs that is brought about by\nGod\u2019s will is brought about by God\u2019s will exclusively,\ntotally, and immediately. While it is plausibly part of theism that\nevery state of affairs that obtains, apart from those that involve\nGod, is somehow dependent on God\u2019s will, this does not show that\ndeontic states of affairs are more interestingly connected to the\ndivine will than states of affairs involving mathematics, or physics,\nor accounting (Murphy 1998, pp. 14\u201316).\n\nWe may put (3) to the side, then. While some formulations of it may\nvery well be true, those formulations for which there is argumentative\nsupport do not establish much in the way of interesting metaethical\nconclusions. The debate concerning whether (1) and (2) is the more\nadequate formulation of theological voluntarism is ongoing, and we\nshould thus proceed in a way that is as far as possible neutral\nbetween the two (though admittedly unwieldy) by saying that\nAs moral obligations to \u03c6 depend on God\u2019s\ncommands/intentions that A \u03c6. (By\n\u2018intentions\u2019 I will mean antecedent intentions.) Allowing\nfor both of these possibilities, what can be said about the\nrelationship of dependence holding between divine commands/intentions\nand moral obligations?\n2.4 What sort of dependence?\n\nThe third issue that must be dealt with in providing a formulation of\ntheological voluntarism is that of the specification of the dependence\nrelationship that holds between divine commands/intentions that A\n\u03c6 and the moral obligation of A to \u03c6. There have been\nseveral options considered whose nature and merits are worth\ndiscussing here. On an analysis view, it is part of the\nmeaning of \u2018it is morally obligatory for A to\n\u03c6\u2019 that God commands/intends that A \u03c6. On a\nreduction view, the state of affairs its being obligatory\nfor A to \u03c6 is the state of affairs God\u2019s\ncommanding/intending that A \u03c6. On a supervenience\nview, its being obligatory for A to \u03c6 supervenes on\nGod\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6. On a causal\nview, necessarily, its being obligatory for A to \u03c6 is\ncaused by God\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6, and\nnecessarily, God\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6\ncauses it to be obligatory for A to \u03c6.\nCausation\n\nThe causal view is defended by Quinn (1979, 1990, 1999), and in a\nparticularly strong form: on Quinn\u2019s view, the causal connection\nbetween God\u2019s antecedently intending that A \u03c6 and\nits being obligatory for A to \u03c6 exhibits totality,\nexclusivity, activity, immediacy, and necessity.\n\nThere are at least three serious difficulties for the causation\nformulation. The first we may call the \u2018Humean worry\u2019.\nOnce we allow that its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\ndistinct from God\u2019s commanding/intending\n\u03c6-ing, there is the question of what reason we would have\nfor thinking that its being morally obligatory to \u03c6\nnecessarily obtains if God\u2019s commanding/intending\n\u03c6-ing obtains. And whatever answer the defender of this\nview offers, it must be consistent with the causation formulation of\ntheological voluntarism. But it is unclear what would do the trick.\nOne way to try to make this necessary connection is by holding that\nthere is a prior moral obligation to obey God; and so, whenever God\ngives a command/has an intention that one perform some action, it\nfollows that one is morally obligated to perform the action\ncommanded/intended. But we cannot take this route, because if the\ncausation formulation is correct, then all moral obligations\nare caused entirely by God\u2019s commanding/intending activity;\nthere cannot be, then, this prior moral obligation to obey\nGod that would serve as part of the explanans for the\nnecessary connection between divine commands/intentions and moral\nobligations.\n\nThe causal view that is a version of (2) (that is, that its being\nobligatory for A to \u03c6 depends causally on God\u2019s\nwilling that A \u03c6) should be distinguished carefully from the\ncausal view that is a version of (3) (that is, that its being\nobligatory for A to \u03c6 depends causally on\nGod\u2019s willing that it be obligatory for A to\n\u03c6). The causal formulation of (3) has at least some\nplausibility as a result of God\u2019s sovereignty and\nomnipotence\u2014though it is in the end unclear why we should move\nfrom the claim that God is the ultimate source of all being to the\nclaim that, for all deontic states of affairs, God\u2019s willing\nthat that deontic state of affairs obtain is the immediate,\ntotal, and exclusive cause of its obtaining. Most of\nus would not, after all, find intuitively compelling a move from the\nclaim that God is ultimate source of all being to the claim that, for\nall physical states of affairs, God\u2019s willing that that\nphysical state of affairs obtain is the immediate, total, and\nexclusive cause of its obtaining. (That view is\n\u2018occasionalism\u2019, and occasionalism is a distinctly\nminority view even among theists; see Murphy 2011 (pp. 140\u2013142)\nfor a comparison between theological voluntarism and occasionalism.)\nThe causal view as an instance of (2), though, seems to have even less\nin the way of argumentative support. Why would one think that\nGod\u2019s intending that A \u03c6 is an immediate, total,\nand exclusive cause of a deontic state of affairs\u2019 obtaining? In\nthe absence of some evidence for such a connection, it is hard to see\nwhy one would be attracted to this formulation of theological\nvoluntarism.\n\nThe second worry about the causal formulation I will call the\n\u2018lack of precedent worry\u2019. Moral properties and states of\naffairs supervene on nonmoral properties and states of affairs. The\nintuitive idea is that there can be no differences in moral status\nwithout some difference in nonmoral status. The causal formulation\nsatisfies the supervenience constraint\u2014the differences in\nnonmoral status concern God\u2019s commands/intentions\u2014but it\ndoes so in a way that is unprecedented and mysterious. When we look at\nthe specific ways in which changes in nonmoral facts can make a\ndifference to the moral facts that hold, there is a pretty limited\nnumber of intelligible relationships that can hold between these\nnonmoral facts and the moral facts that supervene on them. A nonmoral\nfact can be part of what constitutes a reason to perform an action.\n(That you promised to \u03c6 can be cited in explaining why you have a\nreason to \u03c6 your promising to \u03c6 constitutes, at least in part,\nthe reason that you have to \u03c6.) It can be part of an enabling\ncondition for that reason. (The existence of a social practice of\npromising can be cited in explaining why you have a reason to \u03c6;\nthe existence of that practice might explain why your promise has the\nreason-giving force that it has.) It can be cited as a\ndefeater-defeater for a reason. (While the fact the promisee told you\nthat you need not fulfill your promise to \u03c6 typically releases you\nfrom your promise to \u03c6, the fact that you threatened to beat up\nthe promisee if he or she did not tell you that you need not fulfill\nyour promise invalidates that release, and can be cited in explaining\nwhy you have a reason to \u03c6.) But while theological voluntarism\nholds that a fact\u2014the fact that God commands/intends that one\n\u03c6\u2014explains why one has a reason (in this case, an\nobligation) to \u03c6, the causal view holds that this fact falls into\nnone of the familiar explanatory categories: it is not constitutive of\nthe reason, it is not an enabling condition for the reason, it is not\na defeater-defeater for the reason. The way that the fact is supposed\nto explain the reason is merely causal: it just brings the\nreason about, exclusively, totally, immediately. This is an entirely\nunfamiliar phenomenon: nowhere else do we encounter a merely causal\nconnection between a nonmoral fact and a moral one. (The appeal to the\nvery strangeness of divine causation itself is not sufficient to\nanswer the objection. For there is an extra strangeness here: that the\nrelationship between nonmoral and moral facts is in every case with\nwhich we are familiar a rational relationship, whereas on the causal\nformulation of theological voluntarism the relationship is merely\ncausal. Creation ex nihilo does not constitute carte blanche\nto multiply strangenesses. Interestingly, though, Wielenberg 2018 (p.\n18), which rejects the project of theistic ethics, appeals to just\nthis sort of causation to explain the supervenience of the moral on\nthe non-moral.)\n\nThe third worry is the \u2018no authority worry\u2019. Theological\nvoluntarism can be defended on the basis of considerations proper to\nmetaethics\u2014that, for example, theological voluntarism provides\nthe best explanation for the impartiality of morals, or for its\noverridingness, or for its normativity, or for its content. But\ntheological voluntarists have tended to argue that theological\nvoluntarism has something specific to offer to theists. One of these\nbenefits on offer is that theological voluntarism fits well with the\ncentrality of the virtue of obedience in theistic thought and practice\n(Quinn 1992, p. 510; Adams 1973, pp. 99\u2013103). God is a being who\nis to be obeyed, is someone who is a practical\nauthority over us.\n\nFor one to be a practical authority over another is, at least, for one\nto have some sort of control over others\u2019 reasons for action.\nWhatever else practical authority is, it is the ability to make a\ndifference with respect to someone\u2019s reasons to act. The control\ninvolved in practical authority is, however, of a specific sort: it is\nconstitutive control. When a party is an authority over\nanother, his or her dictates constitute, at least in part, reasons for\naction for that other. (One piece of evidence for this is that when we\ntake A to be an authority over us, we will cite\n\u2018A told us to\u2019 as a reason for action.) But if\nGod\u2019s commands to \u03c6 have merely causal power to bring about\nobligations to \u03c6, then the resultant state of affairs that is the\nreason for action is its being obligatory to \u03c6\u2014a\nstate of affairs that need not be in any way constituted by\nGod\u2019s issuing any commands. No version of theological\nvoluntarism that is built simply around God\u2019s causal role in\nactualizing moral obligations implies that God is a practical\nauthority. (See Murphy 2002, 4.3.)\nSupervenience\n\nThe supervenience account is defended by Hare (2001). Suppose that we\ncontinue to interpret supervenience intuitively as the\nno-difference-in-moral-properties-without-some-difference-in-nonmoral-properties\nthesis. We can see very quickly that the theological voluntarist has\nto say something more about the sort of supervenience he or she has in\nmind in order to present what is genuinely a theological voluntarist\naccount of moral obligation. For suppose that one puts forward a view\non which both of the following claims are true: the moral law does not\ndepend on, nor is it identical with, God\u2019s commands; but God\nnecessarily commands us to follow the moral law. While it is obvious\nis that this not a version of theological voluntarism at\nall\u2014moral obligation in no way depends on divine\ncommand\u2014it satisfies the intuitive description of what is\ninvolved in the supervenience of the moral on the nonmoral: for there\ncould be, on this view, no differences in moral status without some\ndifference in divine commands. So if one is to put forward a\nsupervenience formulation of theological voluntarism, then one will\nhave to either be a little bit more doctrinaire about the\nsupervenience relationship, so that it will exclude the nonvoluntarist\nview just described, or one will have to say more than that moral\nobligations supervene on divine commands. For our purposes here, they\ncome to the same thing: that there is something more to the\nsupervenience formulation of theological voluntarism than the claim\nthat there are no differences in agents\u2019 moral obligations\nwithout some differences in the divine commands that have been imposed\non that agent.\n\nWhat is called for here is, pretty obviously, just some particular\nrelationship of ontological dependence. It will not be that of\ncausation, for reasons we have already examined. But neither does the\ndefender of the supervenience view want it to be the extreme\ndependence of moral obligations on divine commands affirmed by the\nreduction formulation, on which moral obligations just are\ndivine commands. To avoid collapse into the reduction formulation, it\nhas to hold that moral obligations are distinct from divine commands.\nIt can make this distinction in one of two ways. It could say that\nmoral obligation is wholly distinct from divine command\u2014that is,\nthat the state of affairs its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 is not constituted even in part by God\u2019s\ncommanding \u03c6-ing. Or it could say that moral\nobligation is only partially constituted by divine command\u2014that\nis, that the state of affairs its being obligatory to \u03c6,\nwhile not identical with God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, includes the state of affairs God\u2019s\ncommanding \u03c6-ing (and some other state of affairs\nbesides). Let us consider each of these possibilities in turn.\n\nSuppose first that the defender of the supervenience view affirms that\nmoral obligation is wholly distinct from divine command. If so, then\nall of the arguments that were raised against the causation\nformulation can be leveled against the supervenience view. The no\nauthority issue will arise. Because the states of affairs its\nbeing obligatory to \u03c6 and God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing will be distinct, the supervenience account lacks\nthe resources to underwrite divine authority. For God is authoritative\nonly if God\u2019s commands are themselves reasons for action, but if\nthe states of affairs its being obligatory to \u03c6 and\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing are distinct, then\nGod\u2019s commands will not be themselves reasons for action on the\nadequately strengthened supervenience view. And if these commands are\nnot themselves reasons for action, then God does not constitutively\nactualize reasons for action by His commands; and if God does not\nconstitutively actualize reasons for action by His commands, then God\nis not authoritative. The lack of precedent issue will arise. For the\nadequately strengthened supervenience view cannot view obligations as\nconstituted by divine commands, and no theological voluntarist worthy\nof the name will see God\u2019s commands as merely enablers or\ndefeater-defeaters for obligations; and so the relationship between\ndivine commands and moral obligations is bound to be unprecedented and\nmysterious. And the Humean issue will arise. For the causation view\nis, after all, just the adequately strengthened supervenience view\nplus the claim that the dependence relationship involved in a\nparticular sort of causal dependence. So, understood as affirming a\ndependence relationship between wholly distinct moral obligations and\ndivine commands, the supervenience view has all of the problems of the\ncausation view.\n\nSo the only hope for the supervenience formulation is to hold that\nGod\u2019s commands are proper parts of moral obligations: for if\nthose commands are identical with moral obligations, then the\nsupervenience view collapses into the reduction view, and if moral\nobligations are wholly distinct from divine commands, then the\nsupervenience view fails for the reasons that the causation view\nfails. There are, however, serious difficulties for this partial\nconstitution version: in particular, if one is committed to saying\nthat God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing partly\nconstitutes its being morally obligatory to \u03c6, it is hard\nto see what state of affairs the theological voluntarist would be\ntempted to say is also necessary for moral obligation to be fully\nconstituted. Obviously this other state of affairs cannot be one that\ninvolves moral obligation, on pain of circularity. (So, the\ntheological voluntarist cannot say that its being morally\nobligatory to \u03c6 just is the complex state of affairs\nconsisting both of God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing\nand its being morally obligatory to do what God commands.)\nFurther, in order to remain faithful to the basic idea of the\nsupervenience version, we would have to say that any state of affairs\nthat is held to constitute its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 along with God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing\nmust be a state of affairs that is certain to obtain if\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains. Otherwise,\nit might be the case that its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 does not supervene on God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, for there would be two possible worlds, in both of\nwhich God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains, but\nin only one of which does its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 obtain. This runs contrary to even the basic idea of the\nsupervenience view, on which there are no differences in moral\nobligations without a difference in divine commands. \n\nThese limitations make it hard to imagine what a motivated version of\nthis form of the supervenience view would look like. We have to\nimagine a view of the following form. It is nonnegotiable that the\nstate of affairs its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\npartially constituted by God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing. It is nonnegotiable that there is, apart from\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing, at least one state\nof affairs S that partially constituted its being morally\nobligatory to \u03c6. It is nonnegotiable that S either obtains\nnecessarily or at the very least necessarily obtains if\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains (otherwise\nmoral obligation would not supervene on divine command). And it is\nnonnegotiable that S not involve moral obligation. The only remotely\nplausible candidates for S that come to mind are normative states of\naffairs that fall short of the obligatory, for example,\n\u03c6-ing\u2019s being good (or virtuous, or\npraiseworthy). One might say, for example, that its being\nmorally obligatory to \u03c6 is constituted jointly by\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing and\n\u03c6-ing\u2019s being virtuous. But it is unclear what\nmotivation one would have for affirming such a position. It cannot be\nfor the sake of making sure that God cannot impose a moral obligation\nto do something that is not virtuous: for, ex hypothesi, we know\nalready that \u03c6-ing\u2019s being virtuous obtains\nwhenever God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains,\nfor otherwise its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 would not\nsupervene on God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing.\n\nThe difficulty that faces the defender of the supervenience view can\nbe framed as a dilemma. If the defender of that view holds that the\nstate of affairs its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\nwholly distinct from God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, then he or she is refuted by the considerations\nthat refute the causation view. If, on the other hand, the defender of\nthe supervenience view holds that the state of affairs its being\nmorally obligatory to \u03c6 is partially but not wholly\nconstituted by God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing,\nthen there is pressure to explain why he or she does not simply affirm\nthe reduction view, on which its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 just is God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing.\nUnless the defender of the supervenience view identifies the state of\naffairs that, in addition to God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, makes for a moral obligation to \u03c6, then his or\nher unwillingness to adopt the reduction view will look unmotivated\nand arbitrary.\nAnalysis\n\nAccording to the analysis view, defended in Adams 1973, the concept of\nthe morally obligatory is to be analyzed as that of being commanded by\na loving God. Adams did not put this view forward as an account of the\nmeaning of \u2018obligation\u2019 generally, but only of its meaning\nas employed in Judeo-Christian moral discourse. As evidence for this\nanalysis, Adams appealed to the freedom with which users of that\ndiscourse moved between claims of the form \u2018x is\nobligatory\u2019 and \u2018x is God\u2019s will\u2019 or\n\u2018x is God\u2019s command.\u2019\n\nThere are a couple of central difficulties for this position. The\nfirst is that it seems to imply that those inside and those outside\nthe Judeo-Christian practice of moral discourse have never disagreed\nwhen one has affirmed a claim of the form \u2018 \u03c6-ing is\nobligatory\u2019 and the other denied a claim of that form. For they\ndo not, on Adams\u2019 account, mean the same thing when they use\nthese terms. In atheistic moral discourse, a masterful user of the\nlanguage can say \u2018it is not true that God has commanded\n\u03c6-ing, but \u03c6-ing is nonetheless obligatory\u2019; in\nJudeo-Christian moral discourse, on Adams\u2019 view, one shows\noneself to be either unintelligible or not a masterful user of moral\nlanguage if one were to speak thus. Adams was aware of this\ndifficulty, and attempted to mitigate it: he argued that the agreement\nover which items the term \u2018obligatory\u2019 applied to, and the\nappropriate attitudinal and volitional responses to those things\ncorrectly described as \u2018obligatory,\u2019 made possible\nsubstantive moral discourse (Adams 1973, pp. 116\u2013120). But all\nthis seems to do is to explain how a simulacrum of genuine moral\ndiscourse is preserved; it does not show that what we get is the real\nthing.\n\nThe second difficulty is that of dealing with those within the\nJudeo-Christian tradition of moral discourse who employed or continue\nto employ moral language in a way that is out of step with\nAdams\u2019 analysis. Now, it is not sufficient to refute a suggested\nanalysis of some term that users of that term have questioned or even\nrejected that analysis. But if we take the task of analyzing terms to\nbe that of making explicit and systematizing the platitudes employing\nthat term affirmed by masterful users of that term (Smith 1994, pp.\n29\u201332), and we note that many thoughtful Jews and Christians who\notherwise appear to be masterful users of the language of moral\nobligation have rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, the notion\nthat an act is obligatory if and only if it has been commanded by God,\nthen we would have some reason to doubt whether the analysis\nformulation of theological voluntarism is defensible.\nReduction\n\nAdams\u2019 maneuver in the face of these difficulties was to move\nfrom the analysis to the reduction version of theological voluntarism.\nHe decided that the meaning of the term \u2018morally\nobligatory\u2019 was common to theists and nontheists. There is a\ncommon concept of the morally obligatory, a common concept that makes\npossible substantive agreement and disagreement between theists and\nnontheists. This common concept is neutral between theism and\nnontheism. But, following the now standard Kripke-Putnam line, Adams\naffirms that there are necessary a posteriori truths, among which are\nincluded property identifications. He argued that the property\nbeing wrong is identical to the property being contrary\nto the commands of (a loving) God because the property being\ncontrary to the commands of (a loving) God best fills the role\nassigned by the concept of wrongness (Adams 1979a, pp. 133\u2013142;\nsee also Adams 1999, pp. 252\u2013258). By conceptual analysis alone\nwe can know only that wrongness is a property of actions (and perhaps\nintentions and attitudes); that people are generally opposed to what\nthey regard as wrong; that wrongness is a reason, perhaps a conclusive\nreason, for opposing an act; and that there are certain acts (e.g.\ntorture for fun) that are wrong. But given traditional theistic\nbeliefs, the best candidate property to fill the role set by the\nconcept of wrongness is that of being contrary to (a loving)\nGod\u2019s commands. For that property is an objective property of\nactions. Further, given Christian views about the content of\nGod\u2019s commands, this identification fits well with widespread\npre-theoretical intuitions about wrongness; and given Christian views\nabout human receptivity to divine communication and God\u2019s\nwillingness to communicate both naturally and supernaturally,\nGod\u2019s commands have a causal role in our acquisition of moral\nknowledge (Adams 1979, p. 139; see also Adams 1999, pp. 257).\n\nThe reduction formulation avoids the most troublesome implications of\nthe analysis formulation, for it allows that there is a common concept\nof obligation, so that those within the Judeo-Christian tradition and\nthose outside it can engage in moral debate and can have substantive\nagreements and disagreements with each other, and so that those within\nthe Judeo-Christian tradition can raise substantive questions about\nthe relationship between God and obligation without ipso facto\nexcluding themselves from the class of masterful users of the moral\nconcepts of that community. The reduction formulation allows that the\nconcept of obligation may be nontheistic while the property that best\nfills the role assigned to it by that concept is a theistic one.\nAnalysis vs. reduction\n\nNevertheless, it remains an open question whether the reduction view\nis superior to the analysis view. One might argue that Adams\u2019\nanalogy to \u2018H2O is water\u2019 is inappropriate, as\nthe identification with water with H2O is clearly a\nposteriori, whereas the identification of the morally obligatory with\nthe commanded by God is a priori. For if Adams is right in his\ncharacterization of the concept of obligation, it is not as if those\nwho do not have the ability to infer from \u2018this is morally\nobligatory\u2019 to \u2018this is commanded by a loving God\u2019\n(and vice versa) are just missing out on an interesting extra fact,\nthe way that those without rudimentary chemistry are missing out on an\ninteresting extra fact if they do not know that water is\nH2O. The term \u2018water\u2019 can play its role in our\npractical lives perfectly well without our knowing that it is\nH2O. The term \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 cannot play\nits role in our practical lives without our knowing that the morally\nobligatory is the commanded by God. No unintelligibility creeps into\nthe life of agents that do not grasp that water is H2O;\nunintelligibility creeps into the life of agents that do not grasp\nthat the morally obligatory is what is commanded by God.\n\nWhy might one think that the masterful use of \u2018morally\nobligatory\u2019 requires recognition that the morally obligatory is\nwhat is commanded by God? If Adams is right, it is part of the meaning\nof obligation that obligations are social in character (Adams 1999, p.\n233) and involve actually made demands by one party in the social\nrelationship on another (Adams 1999, pp. 245\u2013246). It is the\nfact that a demand is actually made that gives sense to the notion\nthat one has to perform an action, rather than merely that it would be\ngood, even the best, to do it (Adams 1999, p. 246). But if it is part\nof the meaning of \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 that one is part of\na certain social relationship in which demands are actually made, then\nit is no longer just an interesting further fact that the property\nthat best answers to the concept \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 is\nthe property being commanded by God. Rather, one who denies\nthat there is a God or that God actually makes demands on human beings\nmust fail to use the term \u2018morally obligatory\u2019\nmasterfully. For think of the other marks of the moral, especially\nthose of impartiality and overridingness. For one to think of an act\nas obligatory is for one to think of it as being actually imposed on\none as a demand; for every obligation, on Adams\u2019 view, there is\nsomeone who imposes that obligation by commanding. It is clear a\npriori that the only being that could impose the sort of obligation\nthat could plausibly be classified as moral would be God. How, then,\ncould one be a masterful user of \u2018moral obligation\u2019\nwithout grasping that moral obligations are demands imposed by\nGod?\n\nThis analysis view would not, unlike Adams\u2019 earlier formulation,\nrequire the subdivision of linguistic communities. One could say that\nthe meaning of \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 includes \u2018being\ncommanded by God,\u2019 for both theists and nontheists.\nThose who do not grasp that it is of the essence of obligations to be\ndivinely commanded\u2014whether theists or nontheists\u2014fail to\nbe masterful users of the language of moral obligation. To embrace\nthis view is to return to the position of Anscombe 1958, according to\nwhich we should hold that the concept of obligation is inherently\ntheological. On this view, we should not allow that Judeo-Christian\nmoral practice has a different concept of obligation. Rather, the\ntheological understanding of obligation is the authentic one, and\nnontheological concepts of obligation are unintelligible truncations.\n\n3. Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism\n\nApart from the difficulties that must be handled by particular\nformulations of theological voluntarism, there are a number of\nobjections that have been levelled against theological voluntarist\nviews as such. A wide variety of these objections are helpfully\ndiscussed in Quinn 1999 (pp. 65\u201371) and Evans 2013 (pp.\n88\u2013117). Here I will consider only two objections, but they are\nthe two that are characteristically taken to be the most powerful\nperennial objections to theological voluntarism: first, that\ntheological voluntarism is incompatible with any substantive sense in\nwhich God is good; second, that theological voluntarism entails the\narbitrariness of morality. While these objections have been answered\nplausibly in recent formulations of theological voluntarism, the way\nthat these objections have been answered leave theological\nvoluntarists open to a different objection: that theological\nvoluntarism is not adequately motivated as a philosophical position,\neven for theists. I conclude with a brief discussion of this\nworry.\n3.1 Theological voluntarism and God\u2019s goodness\n\nGod is, by definition, good. This is both a fixed point concerning\nGod\u2019s nature and a plausibility-making feature of theological\nvoluntarism. If one were to deny that God is good (understood de\ndicto\u2014that is, \u2018if there is a being that qualifies as\nGod, then that being is good\u2019), one would call one\u2019s own\ncompetence in use of the term \u2018God\u2019 into question. And\neven if it were allowed that one can employ the term \u2018God\u2019\nmasterfully while denying that God is good, if one were to deny that\nGod is good, then one would undercut one\u2019s capacity to defend\ntheological voluntarism. For theological voluntarism is plausible only\nif God is an exalted being; but a being that is not good is not an\nexalted being.\n\nThat God is good is a fixed point for theistic discourse in general\nand for theological voluntarism in particular provides the basis for a\ncommon objection to theological voluntarism: that theological\nvoluntarism makes it impossible to say that, in any substantive sense,\nGod is good. The most straightforward formulation of the objection is\nas follows. For God to be good is for God to be morally good. But if\nmoral goodness is to be understood in theological voluntarist terms,\nthen God\u2019s goodness consists only in God\u2019s measuring up to\na standard that God has set for Godself. While this is perhaps an\nadmirable resoluteness\u2014it is, other things being equal, a good\nthing to live up to your own standards\u2014it is hardly the sort of\nthing that provokes in us the admiration that God\u2019s goodness is\nsupposed to provoke.\n\nNow, one might dispute the claim that if God\u2019s goodness consists\nsimply in God\u2019s living up to a standard that God has set for\nHimself, then that goodness is far less admirable than we would have\nsupposed. (See, for a nice discussion of this issue, Clark 1982, esp.\npp. 341\u2013343.) Suppose, though, that we grant this part of the\nargument. How powerful is the objection from God\u2019s goodness\nagainst theological voluntarism?\n\nAs we noted earlier, theological voluntarism comes in a variety of\nstrengths. One dimension along which a theological voluntarist view\nmight be assessed as stronger or weaker is in terms of the range of\nnormative properties that it attempts to account for in theological\nvoluntarist terms. The strength of the objection from God\u2019s\ngoodness is directly proportional to the size of the range of\nnormative properties that one wishes to explain in theological\nvoluntarist terms (see also Alston 1990). If one wishes only to\naccount for a proper subset of moral notions, such as obligation, with\none\u2019s theological voluntarism, then the objection from\nGod\u2019s goodness is very weak; if one wishes to provide a sweeping\naccount of normativity in theological voluntarist terms, then the\nobjection is much stronger.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one defends a version of theological\nvoluntarism that accounts only for obligation. If moral obligation\nonly is dependent on acts of the divine will, one can appeal to moral\nnotions other than deontic ones in order to provide a substantive\nsense in which God is good. Granting to some extent the force of the\nobjection, we can say, on this view, that God\u2019s moral goodness\ncannot consist in God\u2019s adhering to what is morally obligatory.\nBut there are other ways to assess God morally other than in terms of\nthe morally obligatory. Adams, for example, holds that God should be\nunderstood as benevolent and as just, and indeed concedes that his\ntheological voluntarist account of obligation as the divinely\ncommanded is implausible unless God is thus understood (Adams 1999,\npp. 253\u2013255). The ascription to God of these moral virtues is\nentirely consistent with his theological voluntarism, for his\ntheological voluntarism is not meant to provide any account of the\nmoral virtues. One can hold that God\u2019s moral goodness involves\nsupereminent possession of the virtues, at least insofar as those\nvirtues do not presuppose weakness and vulnerability. God is good\nbecause God is supremely just, loyal, faithful, benevolent, and so\nforth. It seems that ascribing to God supereminent possession of these\nvirtues would be enough to account for God\u2019s supreme moral\ngoodness: it is, after all, in such terms that God is praised in the\nPsalms.\n\nIt has been argued that this appeal to God\u2019s justice is\nillegitimate within a theological voluntarist account, because what is\njust is a matter of moral requirement, and so to suppose that\nGod\u2019s acting justly is metaphysically prior to God\u2019s\nimposing all moral requirements by way of commanding is incoherent\n(Hooker 2001, p. 334). But the theological voluntarist may deny that\nacting justly is morally required prior to God\u2019s commanding it,\nany more than acting courageously, temperately, or prudently are\nmorally required prior to God\u2019s commanding us to act\ncourageously, temperately, or prudently. Just as one can coherently\nacknowledge the excellence of temperance while wondering whether one\nis morally obligated to act temperately, one can coherently\nacknowledge the excellence of justice while wondering whether one is\nmorally obligated to act justly. It thus seems an available strategy\nfor the theological voluntarist who holds a restricted view of the\nrange of moral properties explained by God\u2019s commands/intentions\nto appeal to justice in accounting for God\u2019s goodness. \n\nMatters become more difficult for theological voluntarist views that\naim to provide accounts of all moral notions in terms of God\u2019s\nwill. If one held to such an ambitious version of theological\nvoluntarism\u2014if one were to hold, say, that a state of affairs is\nmorally good because it is a state of affairs that God wishes to\nobtain for its own sake, and that a character trait is a moral virtue\nbecause it is a property that God wants one to have for its own sake,\nand that an action is morally obligatory because it is antecedently\nintended by God, and so forth\u2014then obviously the gambit employed\nby the less ambitious theological voluntarist is unavailable. The more\nambitious theological voluntarist should hold, instead, that\nGod\u2019s goodness is not to be understood in moral terms.\nGod\u2019s being good might be understood in terms of God\u2019s\nbeing good to us, where us includes all created rational\nbeings, or all created sentient beings, or whatever class of created\nbeings to which one thinks that God has a special relationship. What\nit is for God to be good to us would be for God to be loving\u2014to\nwill each of our goods, and to do so in a way that plays no favorites.\nThis understanding of \u2018loving\u2019 does not run afoul of\ntheological voluntarism construed as an account of all moral goods,\nbecause \u2018our goods\u2019 is to be interpreted in terms of\nprudential goodness, what makes each of us well-off (but see Chandler\n1985).\n\nSuppose, though, that one were to go all the way, holding that\ntheological voluntarism is the correct account of all normative\nnotions: on this extremely ambitious view, anything that is\nintrinsically action-guiding depends on God\u2019s will. I think that\nthe \u2018God is good to us\u2019 understanding of God\u2019s\ngoodness is ruled out on this approach: for the notion of \u2018good\nto us\u2019 is a normative notion. Perhaps one could hold, on this\nview, that \u2018God is good\u2019 affirms of God some sort of\nmetaphysical goodness, fullness of being. This surely makes God\nexalted, but it is not clear whether the will of such a being is\nplausibly understood as the source of all normative statuses. It is\nalso less than clear that \u2018God is good,\u2019 on this reading,\nis the claim that God possesses a particular perfection, rather than\nis merely a reminder that God has a variety of perfections.\n\nTo sum up, then: for each of the various formulations of theological\nvoluntarism, there seems to be some way of answering the charge that\nthe view undercuts the notion that God is good. But the strain needed\nto answer the charge becomes greater the wider the range of normative\nproperties that the formulation of theological voluntarism aims to\nexplain.\n3.2 Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness\n\nIt is also an extraordinarily popular charge against theological\nvoluntarism that it entails, objectionably, that morality is\narbitrary. There is, however, more than one objection here, and the\ndifferent objections need to be distinguished and answered\nindividually. One claim is that theological voluntarism implies that\nGod\u2019s commands/intentions, on which moral statuses depend, must\nbe arbitrary. A distinct claim is that theological voluntarism implies\nthat the content of morality is itself arbitrary, that it is of the\nessence of morality to exhibit a certain rational structure, and that\ntheological voluntarism precludes its having that structure. I will\nconsider each of these objections in turn.\n\nOne arbitrariness objection against theological voluntarism is that if\ntheological voluntarism is true, then God\u2019s commands/intentions\nmust be arbitrary; and it cannot be that morality could wholly depend\non something arbitrary; and so theological voluntarism must be false.\nIn favor of the claim that if theological voluntarism were true, then\nmorality would be arbitrary: morality would be arbitrary, on\ntheological voluntarism, if God lacks reasons for the\ncommands/intentions that God gives/has; but because theological\nvoluntarism holds that reasons depend on God\u2019s\ncommands/intentions, it is clear that there could ultimately be no\nreason for God\u2019s commanding/intending one thing rather than\nanother. In favor of the claim that morality could not wholly depend\non something arbitrary: when we say that some moral state of affairs\nobtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of\naffairs obtaining rather than another. Moral states of affairs do not\njust happen to obtain.\n\nJust as in the case of the objection from God\u2019s goodness, the\nstrength of this version of the objection from arbitrariness depends\non the formulation of theological voluntarism that is being attacked.\nThe arbitrariness objection becomes more difficult to answer the\nstronger the relationship between God\u2019s intentions/commands and\nmoral properties is held to be; and it becomes more difficult to\nanswer the more normative properties one attempts to account for by\nappeal to God\u2019s intentions/commands.\n\nThe arbitrariness objection has less force if one holds that, say,\nonly moral obligations are to be accounted for by theological\nvoluntarism. The claim made by the objector is that morality is\narbitrary on theological voluntarism, because God has no reason for\nhaving one set of commands/intentions rather than another. But this is\nso only if one appeals to the very strong form of theological\nvoluntarism on which all normative states of affairs depend on\nGod\u2019s will. If one holds that only moral obligations are\ndetermined by God\u2019s will, then God might have moral reasons for\nselecting one set of commands/intentions rather than another: that,\nfor example, one set of commands/intentions is more benevolent, or\njust, or loyal, than another. If one holds that all moral properties\nare determined by God\u2019s will, then God might have nonmoral\nreasons for selecting one set of commands/intentions rather than\nanother: that one set of commands/intentions is more loving than\nanother. The fewer normative properties that a version of theological\nvoluntarism attempts to account for, the less susceptible it is to the\nclaim that theological voluntarism implies the arbitrariness of\nGod\u2019s commands/intentions. (For further discussion of the role\nthat restriction of theological voluntarism to a proper subset of\nnormative statuses has had in answering these perennial objections,\nsee Murphy 2012.)\n\nNow, one might respond on behalf of this version of the arbitrariness\nobjection that even if it is true that there can be reasons for God to\nchoose the commands/intentions that God chooses, it is unlikely that\nthese reasons would wholly determine God\u2019s choice of\ncommands/intentions, and so there would be some latitude for\narbitrariness in God\u2019s choices/intentions. But of itself this is\nnot much of a worry. The initial claim pressed against theological\nvoluntarism was that it made all of God\u2019s commands/intentions\nultimately arbitrary, and morality could not depend on something so\nthoroughly arbitrary. But the chastened claim\u2014that there is some\narbitrariness in God\u2019s commands\u2014is far less troubling on\nits own. We are already familiar with morality depending to some\nextent on arbitrary facts about the world: if one thinks about the\nparticular requirements that he or she is under, one will note\nstraightaway the extent to which these requirements have resulted from\ncontingent and indeed fluky facts about oneself, one\u2019s\nrelationships, and one\u2019s circumstances. It does not seem that\nallowing that God has some choices to make concerning what to\ncommand/intend with respect to the conduct of created rational beings\nthat are undetermined by reasons must introduce an intolerable\narbitrariness into the total set of divine commands/intentions. (See\nalso Carson 2012.)\n\nAllowing for such pockets of divine discretion does not provide\nbacking for this version of the objection from arbitrariness, but\nrather offers a premise for the other version of the objection from\narbitrariness. This other version of the objection from arbitrariness\nholds that moral states of affairs exhibit a certain rational\nstructure that they would not have if theological voluntarism were\ntrue. Here is the idea, roughly formulated. Suppose that some moral\nstate of affairs obtains\u2014that it is the case that murder is\nwrong, or that lying is objectionable, or that courage is a virtue, or\nthat Sharon\u2019s snubbing me in that way was unforgivable. The idea\nis that for any such moral state of affairs, the following is true:\neither we can provide a justification for the obtaining of\nthat moral state of affairs, or that moral state of affairs is\nnecessary. A justification of an obtaining moral state of\naffairs A is some obtaining moral state of affairs B\n(where A is not identical with B), which in\nconjunction with the other non-moral facts entails that A\nobtains. So, for example: it may be the justification for\nmurder\u2019s being prima facie wrong that murder is an\nintentional harm (non-moral fact) and intentionally harming is prima\nfacie wrong (obtaining moral state of affairs). Now, presumably not\nall moral states of affairs can be justified: eventually there will be\nbasic moral states of affairs, for which no justification can be\ngiven. But it would be very unsatisfactory to say that these basic\nmoral states of affairs just happen to obtain. So any basic moral\nstates of affairs must obtain necessarily. Perhaps unrelieved\nsuffering\u2019s being bad is a state of affairs of this sort,\nor perhaps rational beings\u2019 being worthy of\nrespect.\n\nThe claim that the structure of morality is not arbitrary is, put\npositively, the claim that every obtaining moral state of affairs\neither has a justification or is necessary. And, thus, what those who\nclaim that theological voluntarism entails that morality is\nobjectionably arbitrary mean is that if theological voluntarism is\ntrue, then there are some moral states of affairs that both lack a\njustification and are not necessary. The view that God\u2019s\ncommands/intentions are not wholly determined by reasons offer our\nbasis for holding that there are some moral states of affairs that\nboth lack a justification and are not necessary. For consider some act\nof \u03c6-ing that is not subsumed under any other issued divine\ncommand and which is such that God lacks decisive reasons to command\nor not to command its performance. In the possible world in which God\nissues a command to \u03c6, there is a moral state of\naffairs\u2014its being obligatory to \u03c6\u2014which lacks\na justification (for the action is subsumed under no other divine\ncommand) and is not necessary (for God might have failed to command\nthe action).\n\nOne might respond to this sort of worry by proposing that what God\ncommands/intends with respect to human action, God commands/intends\nnecessarily. But this seems either to understate the divine freedom or\nto overstate the determination of God\u2019s commands by reasons\n(Murphy 2002, pp. 83\u201385). More plausible is the denial of the\nclaim that morality must exhibit the particular structure presupposed\nin the objection. While I think that in general the subsumption model\nof justification is innocuous enough\u2014even particularists can\naffirm it, if they affirm even the most minimal doctrine of moral\nsupervenience\u2014its appeal to necessary moral states of affairs as\nthe only proper starting point is dubious. It is not clear why the\nstarting points for justification have to be necessary moral states of\naffairs, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, if these moral states of affairs are basic, then of course\ntheir moral status must not be explained by appeal to other moral\nstates of affairs, but that does not mean they must be necessary; they\nmight be contingent, and have their moral status explained in some way\nother than an appeal to another moral state of affairs. It could be,\nfor example, that the explanation of them appeals to a contingent\nnonmoral state of affairs plus some necessary state of affairs\nconcerning a connection between that contingent nonmoral state of\naffairs and the moral state of affairs. Theological voluntarism would\nbe an instance of this latter model. (For a discussion of a similar\nobjection raised against theological voluntarism by Ralph Cudworth\n(1731), and a similar response on behalf of theological voluntarism,\nsee Schroeder 2005.) \n\nSecond, the appeal to necessary moral states of affairs as the\nstopping point for explanation seems to assume that necessary moral\nstates of affairs somehow are not in need of explanation. But the very\nfact that some state of affairs obtains necessarily does not entail\nthat its obtaining does not require explanation, and there is no\nreason why moral states of affairs would be special on this score. So\none might think that not only is it possible for justifications to\nbottom out in contingent moral states of affairs, there is no reason\nto think that such justifications are as such any less adequate than\njustifications that bottom out in necessary moral states of affairs.\n(See Murphy 2011, pp. 47\u201349.)\n3.3 Is theological voluntarism adequately motivated?\n\nBoth with respect to the objection from God\u2019s goodness and with\nrespect to the objection from arbitrariness, the now-standard\ntheological voluntarist response is not to bite the bullet but rather\nto restrict the range of normative properties of which theological\nvoluntarism is supposed to provide an account. So Adams, Quinn, and\nAlston all recommend theological voluntarism only as a theory about\nproperties like being morally obligatory, and not about any\nother normative properties. The worry is that allowing that there is\nadequate motivation to refuse to understand these other normative\nproperties in theological voluntarist terms might commit one to\nholding that there is adequate motivation to refuse to understand\nobligation-type properties in theological voluntarist terms. Look, one\nmight say: if you are willing to hold that all moral properties other\nthan those in the obligation family are to be understood in\nnon-theological voluntarist terms, what is to stop us from holding\nthat obligation is to be understood in non-theological voluntarist\nterms as well? If we are willing to give up theological voluntarism in\nsome moral domains, why not in all of them?\n\nThe most well-developed account of why we should treat obligation as\nspecial is Adams\u2019, on which obligation is apt for theological\nvoluntarist treatment because of its intrinsic link to demands made\nwithin social relationships (Adams 1987b, and Adams 1999, pp.\n231\u2013258; see also Evans 2014, p. 27). But it is also unclear\nwhether this is persuasive. We may grant that obligations result from\ndemands, but only if we emphasize (as Adams does) that it is demands\nfrom authorities that result in obligations. But what makes\nsomeone an authority is that by his or her dictates he or she can give\nreasons for action of a certain kind. There is some dispute over what\nkind of reasons they must be, but for our purposes we can just follow\nJoseph Raz, who holds that genuine authorities give \u201cprotected\nreasons\u201d by their dictates, where a protected reason to \u03c6 is\na reason to \u03c6 and a reason to disregard some reasons against\n\u03c6-ing. If one is an authority over another with respect to\n\u03c6-ing, then one\u2019s dictate that the other \u03c6 is a\nprotected reason for the other to \u03c6 (Raz 1979, p. 18).\n\nBut now here is the question. We agree that obligations arise from\nauthoritative dictates. And we agree that for a dictate to be\nauthoritative is for it to constitute a certain sort of reason, let us\nsay a protected one. But why, then, would we identify obligations with\nprotected reasons that result from demands, rather than (as Raz does)\nwith protected reasons themselves, whatever their source? If, after\nall, there were other ways of producing protected reasons other than\nthrough the giving of commands, what would be the point of saying\n\u2018oh, but though there is a protected reason to \u03c6, it\nisn\u2019t really obligatory to \u03c6.\u2019 Surely if\nthere were any point to this remark it would be purely verbal, and of\nno philosophical / normative interest.\n\nIt turns out, then, that whether Adams\u2019 move is enough to\nmotivate theological voluntarism about obligation is dependent on\nwhether there are in fact any protected reasons (or reasons of\nwhatever structure that one thinks that authoritative dictates must\ngive) that are not dependent on demands being made. If there are such\nreasons\u2014which natural law theorists, for example, would\nhold\u2014then Adams\u2019 gambit will not work, and the theological\nvoluntarist will have to look elsewhere for motivation to understand\nobligation in those terms.\n\nNow, one might say that by appealing to the idea that obligations\narise from demands made within social relationships as the basis for\nthe theological voluntarist\u2019s account of moral obligation, we\nare misconstruing the key claim that they make about the social nature\nof obligation. The social nature of obligation, voluntarists might\nretort, first and foremost concerns the fact that when one is under an\nobligation, there is someone else who is entitled to hold one\naccountable for failures to adhere to the content of that obligation\n(Adams 1999, p. 233; Evans 2013, p 14). In the case of the moral law,\nthe party who has standing to hold us accountable is God.\n\nEven if one accepts this claim about the nature of obligation \u2014\nit has some plausibility, as there is some basis for holding that not\neverything that one has protected reason to do counts as obligatory\n\u2014 and the claim that only God has adequate standing to hold us\naccountable for adhering to morality, it is still not at all clear how\nto provide a satisfactory rationale for a theological voluntarist view\nof moral obligation. For theological voluntarism with respect to moral\nobligations holds that the existence of moral obligations depends on\nGod\u2019s bringing them about via God\u2019s command or some other\nact of divine will; but there is no obvious argument for the view that\nGod\u2019s being essential to holding us accountable for following\nthe norms of morality entails God\u2019s commanding or willing those\nmoral norms into existence. Even if we grant, then, to the theological\nvoluntarists their desired premises regarding the social character of\nobligation and God\u2019s ideal status as someone to hold us\naccountable for adhering to the norms of morality, theological\nvoluntarists still have a worrisome gap to overcome in offering\npositive reasons to affirm that view.\n",
