    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAristotle\u2019s logical works contain the earliest formal study of\nlogic that we have. It is therefore all the more remarkable that\ntogether they comprise a highly developed logical theory, one that was\nable to command immense respect for many centuries: Kant, who was ten\ntimes more distant from Aristotle than we are from him, even held that\nnothing significant had been added to Aristotle\u2019s views in the\nintervening two millennia.\n\nIn the last century, Aristotle\u2019s reputation as a logician has\nundergone two remarkable reversals. The rise of modern formal logic\nfollowing the work of Frege and Russell brought with it a recognition\nof the many serious limitations of Aristotle\u2019s logic; today,\nvery few would try to maintain that it is adequate as a basis for\nunderstanding science, mathematics, or even everyday reasoning. At the\nsame time, scholars trained in modern formal techniques have come to\nview Aristotle with new respect, not so much for the correctness of\nhis results as for the remarkable similarity in spirit between much of\nhis work and modern logic. As Jonathan Lear has put it,\n\u201cAristotle shares with modern logicians a fundamental interest\nin metatheory\u201d: his primary goal is not to offer a practical\nguide to argumentation but to study the properties of inferential\nsystems themselves.\n",
