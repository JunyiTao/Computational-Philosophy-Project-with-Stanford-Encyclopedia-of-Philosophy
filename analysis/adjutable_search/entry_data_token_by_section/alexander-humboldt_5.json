    "main_text": "Life and Works || Siberian Expedition\n1.6 Siberian Expedition\n\nIn 1829 Humboldt undertook a six-month journey through Siberia,\nsupported by Emperor Nicholas I. The trip, which began in St.\nPetersburg, took Humboldt through the Ural Mountains, the West Siberian\nPlains, and across to the Central Asian Altai Mountains. On the way\nback, the party passed through the Caspian Sea. In total, Humboldt and\nhis travel companions covered some 9,000 miles. As with his trip to\nSouth America, so here, Humboldt took with him the most advanced\ninstruments for measurement. He surveyed the geography, climate, and\ngeomagnetic features of the regions through which he travelled. Later\neditions of his writings\u2014in particular Ansichten der\nNatur\u2014reflect observations and measurements made during\nthis time, and include comparisons between these regions and the ones\nhe had observed in Europe and South America. \n",
