    "main_text": "The Late Period || Paul of Venice\n4.5 Paul of Venice\n\nThe authenticity of the Logica Magna is a matter of some\ncontention. Assuming that Paul was the author, we can find discussions\nby him of the insolubles in at least four works, his Logica\nParva (translated in Paul of Venice 1984 and edited in Paul of\nVenice 2002), his Logica Magna (in the treatise on\n\u2018Insolubles\u2019, in a forthcoming edition and English\ntranslation by Barbara Bartocci and Stephen Read from Paul of Venice\n1499 and the one extant manuscript), in the Quadratura (in at\nleast four of its 200 chapters, Paul of Venice 1493), and in the final\nsophism, no.50, in his Sophismata Aurea (Paul of Venice\n1483). Paul follows two of the leading solutions to the insolubles in\nthe fourteenth century, the modified Heytesbury solution and Roger\nSwyneshed\u2019s, in different works: the modified Heytesbury\nsolution in the Logica Parva and the Quadratura, and\nthat of Swyneshed in the Logica Magna and the Sophismata\n Aurea.[31a]\n\n\nIn the Logica Parva, an elementary pedagogical text, Paul\nclearly follows Heytesbury in accepting an insoluble scenario only if\nit is left open that the insoluble proposition has a secondary or\nadditional signification, but (unlike Heytesbury) specifies that\nadditional signification as asserting its own truth. He spells it out\ntowards the end of ch.6: \n\nIt should be noted that an insoluble has two significates, one exact\n(adequatum) and one principal. The exact significate is a\nsubject-predicate significate similar to the insoluble utterance.\nE.g., the exact significate of \u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019\nis Socrates saying a falsehood or that Socrates says a falsehood. But\nthe principal significate is a compound significate, e.g., that\nSocrates says a falsehood and that the proposition is true.\n However, that the solution Paul presents here is not his\nown, that is, not his preferred solution, is made clear at the end of\nthe chapter, where Paul writes:\n\n\nNotice that not everything I have said here, or in other treatises,\nhave I said according to my own view, but partly according to the view\nof others, in order to enable young beginners to progress more easily.\n Paul\u2019s own view, then, is more likely that which\nhe presents in his major treatment of the insolubles, in his\nLogica Magna.\n\n\nPaul devotes the whole of the first chapter of his treatise on\ninsolubles in the Logica Magna to the rejection of fifteen\nother proposed solutions. The treatment can be seen as falling into\nfour groups, the first three groups corresponding to three sources on\nwhich Paul draws: first, he runs rapidly through seven of the eight\nalternative solutions considered by Bradwardine in his treatise, for\nthe most part summarising almost verbatim Bradwardine\u2019s\nown criticism. He then turns to Heytesbury\u2019s criticism of\nalternative solutions, starting with the second of the four solutions\nconsidered by Heytesbury, that of John Dumbleton. (The first one\nHeytesbury rejects is Swyneshed\u2019s, which Paul will himself\naccept.) The next (third on Heytesbury\u2019s list) is\nKilvington\u2019s, and then Paul comes to Bradwardine\u2019s own\nsolution. Thus the first ten solutions considered are all from Oxford,\nor at least, those discussed at Oxford in the two decades from the\nearly 1320s to the early 1340s. With the eleventh solution, Paul turns\nto his third source, namely, Peter of Mantua, the eleventh being\nAlbert of Saxony\u2019s solution, presented at Paris in the early\n1350s, and possibly the same as John Buridan\u2019s own early\nsolution. (However, Marsilius of Inghen, whose solution is not\ndiscussed by Peter or Paul, appears to have distinguished\nAlbert\u2019s solution from Buridan\u2019s early view: see Spade\n1975, 79.) Albert\u2019s is the first view discussed by Mantua. Next\ncomes Heytesbury\u2019s (Mantua\u2019s second) solution. Before\nproceeding to the third solution discussed by Mantua, Paul considers\nPeter of Ailly\u2019s solution at some length, seemingly drawing\ndirectly on Ailly\u2019s own treatise, to the discussion of which\nPaul appends (without distinguishing it by number) a criticism of\nMantua\u2019s solution. Finally, Paul turns to a rejection of\nrestrictivism, the first solution rejected by Bradwardine and the\nthird by Mantua. But Paul deals with the specific form given to it by\nWalter Segrave (see\n Section 3.2).\n \n\nAfter this extended discussion of alternatives (occupying a quarter of\nhis treatise), Paul sets out to develop his own solution, based firmly\non Roger Swyneshed\u2019s proposals from the 1330s. In his second\nchapter, he systematically lays out his distinctions\n(divisiones) and assumptions (suppositiones), then\ndraws seven Conclusions and seven Corollaries. The basic idea is\nSwyneshed\u2019s, namely, to provide a solution which does not depend\non postulating tacit or hidden or consequential significates for\ninsoluble propositions beyond what is clearly shown---what they\nstandardly suggest or indicate by the straightforward combination of\ntheir parts (in Heytesbury\u2019s phrase, \u201c sicut termini\ncommuniter pretendunt\u201d). Instead, as Swyneshed had\nproposed, Paul tightens the criterion for truth, to exclude those that\nfalsify themselves, weakening the criterion for falsehood to admit\nthose examples that do falsify themselves even if otherwise\nimpeccable. Roger\u2019s second and third notorious Conclusions\nreappear as Paul\u2019s fifth and second respectively. Paul will\nlater describe the second Conclusion as a fundamental principle:\n\nI deny the inference: \u2018The contradictory of A is false,\ntherefore A is true,\u2019 since in the case of insolubles I uphold\nas a fundamental principle that two mutually contradictory\npropositions may both be false.\n Consequently, Paul defines an insoluble as a\nself-falsifying proposition:\n\n\nAn insoluble proposition is a proposition having reflection on itself\nwholly or partially implying its own falsity or that it is not itself\ntrue, such as \u2018This is false,\u2019 \u2018This is not\ntrue,\u2019 referring to themselves, and \u2018This is true,\u2019\nreferring to its contradictory. And so on for many other examples\nwhich can be identified on the basis of what has been said. Therefore\ninsolubles are self-falsifying propositions.\n\n\nIn the rest of the treatise, Paul considers, in ch.3, the objections\nwhich Heytesbury had directed at Swyneshed\u2019s solution, many of\nwhich had already been addressed in discussing the Conclusions and\nCorollaries in ch.2; shows at some length, in ch.4, how his solution\ndeals with the much-discussed example where Socrates only says\n\u2018Socrates says a falsehood\u2019; extends the account, in ch.5,\nto deal with other examples, such as that where Socrates says that his\nsole business is to be hung on the gallows, which are not obviously\ninsolubles until the background scenario is added; in ch.6 to examples\nlike \u2018A falsehood exists\u2019 which become insoluble in a\nsuitable scenario; and in ch.7 to examples involving exclusive and\nexceptive propositions, such as \u2018Only a false proposition is\nexclusive\u2019 (assuming it is the only exclusive proposition) and\n\u2018No proposition except A is false\u2019 (where this is A and is\nthe only exceptive proposition). \n",
