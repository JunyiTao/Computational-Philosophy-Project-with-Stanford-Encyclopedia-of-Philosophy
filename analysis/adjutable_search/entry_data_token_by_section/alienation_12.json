    "main_text": "Alienation and Value || Negative Element\n5.1 Negative Element\n\nThe third of these interesting complexities concerns the ethical\ndimension of alienation. The connections between alienation and ethics\nare many and diverse, and there is no attempt here to sketch that\nwider landscape in its entirety. Instead, attention is drawn to two\ntopographical features: the claim that alienation is necessarily a\nnegative, but not a wholly negative, phenomenon, is elaborated and\ndefended; and the suggestion that some forms of moral theory or even\nmorality itself might encourage or embody alienation is briefly\noutlined.\n\nThe claim that alienation is necessarily a negative, but not a wholly\nnegative, phenomenon can be addressed in two parts. Defending the\nfirst part of that claim looks straightforward enough. Alienation, on\nthe present account, consists in the separation of certain entities\n\u2013 a subject and some object\u2014that properly belong together.\nAs a result, alienation always involves a loss or lack of something of\nvalue, namely, the \u2018proper\u2019\u2014rational, natural, or\ngood\u2014harmony or connectedness between the relevant subject and\nobject. \n",
