    "main_text": "\n\nThe Greek-Arabic sciences penetrated in the Islamic world during the\n8th-10th centuries AD due to the massive\nactivity of the translators and al-Kindi\u2019s vision of knowledge\nand also through the exegetical activity of the Aristotelian circle of\nBaghdad. From the end of the 10th, throughout the\n11th, and up to the beginning of the 12th\ncenturies, the production of original philosophical literature into\nArabic and Persian became the main stream of the Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy, which was by then increasingly distant from the Greek\nsources in Arabic translation. Avicenna\u2019s works fully attest\nthis phenomenon, which prompted a 12th century purist trend\nwell exemplified in the Muslim West by Averroes\u2019 program of\ngoing back to Aristotle: a similar but not identical phenomenon\noccurred also in the Muslim East, with Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad\n\u2018Abd al-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif was a philosopher and polymath who lived between\nthe Second Crusade (1147\u20131149 AD) and the end of the Fifth\nCrusade (1217\u20131231 AD) (Jackson 2017). He was born in Baghdad in\n1162 and died there on 9 November 1231 after a pilgrimage of more than\nforty years during which he travelled throughout Iraq, Syria and Egypt\nlooking for a good teacher in philosophy. He grew up in a\nShafi\u2018i family with excellent links with the Nizamiyya madrasa\nand he received a solid education in Islamic sciences. Then he turned\nto natural sciences, medicine, philosophy and, critically, to alchemy.\nHis spasmodic search for knowledge brought him to meet through their\nwritings Avicenna, al-Ghazali and al-Suhrawardi. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nhad many generous patrons and was in touch with the most important men\nof his era including the Saladin and, in Cairo, Maimonides. Cairo\nrepresented for \u2018Abd al-Latif the much-desired goal of his\npilgrimage, the place where he finally met Aristotle and his\nphilosophy as well as that of his commentators Themistius and\nAlexander, and where he finally encountered the work of the greatest\nArabic Aristotelian commentator of the East, al-Farabi. For \u2018Abd\nal-Latif, Cairo also meant the progressive abandonment of\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy, which he had held to be the only one\npossible during the earlier years of his education. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif was a sharp critic, an independent thinker, and a prodigious\nwriter on philosophy and medicine. His stated intellectual program was\nthat to go back to the original Greek works in Arabic translation, and\nin particular to return to Aristotle in philosophy and to Hippocrates,\nvia Galen, in medicine, but he was able to go back to these sources\nonly through the lens of their reworkings by the philosophers before\nAvicenna, al-Kindi and al-Farabi.\n",
