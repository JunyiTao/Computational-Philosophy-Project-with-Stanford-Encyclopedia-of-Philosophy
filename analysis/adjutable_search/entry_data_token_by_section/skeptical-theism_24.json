    "main_text": "Scope of Skeptical Theism || Divine Hiddenness\n7.3 Divine Hiddenness\n\nDivine hiddenness arguments use facts about the apparent\n\u201chiddenness\u201d or \u201cabsence\u201d or\n\u201csilence\u201d of God to argue against the existence of God\n(cf. Schellenberg 1993, 2007, 2015). A simple argument from divine\nhiddenness is:\n\nHiddenness\n\nH1\nIf God exists, there is no non-resistant, non-belief.\nH2\nThere is non-resistant, non-belief.\nH3\nTherefore, God does not exist.\n\n\n\nNon-resistant, non-belief refers to people who meet two conditions.\nFirst, they do not believe in God. Second, they are not resistant to\nbelief in God, where not being resistant may include both having the\nconceptual and emotional abilities to have a relationship with God as\nwell not having intentionally and culpably resisted such a\nrelationship. H1 can be defended in\nvarious ways, including: according to theism, being in a personal\nrelationship with God is the greatest good for people. However, the\nargument goes, such a personal relationship requires belief. Thus, if\nGod exists, and a person is not resistant to such a\nrelationship\u2014the person\u2019s greatest good\u2014then God\nwould \u201cmake his presence known\u201d to the person so they\nmight reasonably believe that God exists and enter into such a\nrelationship. In other words, God would not remain hidden from those\nwho are receptive to a relationship with God. But\nH2 claims there are such\npeople\u2014who are not resistant yet do not believe. Thus, there is\nno God.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some authors claim this argument for\nH1 is vulnerable to skeptical theistic\ncritique (see Bergmann 2009: 382, McBrayer and Swenson 2012). So far\nas we can tell, there is no reason that would justify God in remaining\nhidden to people who are receptive to a relationship with God. But\nfrom the mere fact that we cannot identify such a reason, it does not\nfollow that there is no such reason. Thus, attempts to\nestablish H1 by appealing to our knowledge\nof how God might plan to bring about certain goods\u2014like a loving\npersonal relation\u2014may be vulnerable to skeptical theistic\ncritique.\n",
