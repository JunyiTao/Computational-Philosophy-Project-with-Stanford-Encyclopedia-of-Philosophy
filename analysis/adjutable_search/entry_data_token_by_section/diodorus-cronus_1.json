Minima and motion\n\n\nDiodorus is credited with four paradoxes of motion, which inevitably\ncall to mind the celebrated four motion paradoxes of Zeno of Elea.\n\n\n Of Diodorus\u2019s four paradoxes (Sextus Empiricus,\nAgainst the professors 10.85\u2013118), two rested on the\nhypothesis that matter and space are only finitely divisible, namely\ninto vanishingly small quanta, termed by him \u2018smallest and\npartless\u2019 (elachista kai amer\u0113) bodies and places.\nHe may have postulated similar minima for time as well. Sextus calls\nthe postulation of minima Diodorus\u2019s \u2018hypothesis\u2019, but\nthe denial of motion his \u2018own doctrine\u2019 (10.85\u201386), and we\nmight do well to accept this distinction of status. Although there is\nplentiful evidence that Diodorus did himself endorse the thesis of\nminima as a correct account of the world\u2019s constitution, it was a\ncontroversial view, to which a dialectician could not count on his\ninterlocutors\u2019 agreement. Hence in arguing against motion he may\nhave treated it as a hypothesis, and designed some of his arguments to\nbe independent of it.\n\n\nCertainly some of those puzzled by Zeno\u2019s dichotomy argument\nagainst motion (see Zeno of Elea 2.2.1) had sought to resolve the\npuzzlement by postulating a smallest magnitude. That solution, although\nrejected by Aristotle, was defended by his contemporary Xenocrates, a\nleading Platonist. Diodorus, a generation later, can be seen taking up\nthis supposed solution to the Zenonian paradox and showing that it\nitself in fact generates a new motion paradox, the first of his four.\n(1) A minimal and partless body could never be moving, he argues,\nbecause it always exactly fills the minimal space that it occupies. It\nmay next appear in a precisely adjacent space, but in the intervening\ntime it could never be in transition from the one space to the\nother: that would have required its being partly in and partly not in\nthe original space, whereas what has no parts cannot be\n\u2018partly\u2019 in anything. (The basic argument goes back to\nPlato, Parmenides 138d\u2013e and Aristotle, Physics\n6.10.)\n\n\nAlthough he here denies that things move, Diodorus is not rejecting\nordinary experience, as Zeno of Elea is generally held to have done. He\nconcedes the empirical fact that things are in different places at\ndifferent times, and therefore that an item can be said to \u2018have\nmoved\u2019. What he denies is that motion could ever be taking place\nin the present. It may nevertheless be true that something has moved.\nThe result, a staccato analysis of motion comparable to a series of\nfilm frames, is quite sufficient to account for our experience.\n\n\nBut can it be true that something, in this case motion, has\nhappened, when it was never true to say of it \u2018It is\nhappening\u2019? Yes, replies Diodorus (Sextus, 10.97\u2013100): for\nexample, \u2018These men have married\u2019 may be true despite the\nfact that there was never a time when it was true to say of them\n\u2018These men are marrying,\u2019 since they each married at a\ndifferent time. This supporting argument, drawn from Diodorus\u2019s\nlogical arsenal, sits comfortably with the assumption that the staccato\ntheory of motion really was his own doctrine. Although unmistakably in\nthe tradition of Zeno of Elea, it is an attempt to make us re-analyse,\nrather than reject, phenomenal change.\n\n\nDiodorus also sought to defend his motion doctrine with his second\nand third motion paradoxes, both of them independent of the hypothesis\nof minima.\n\n\n(Paradox 2) \u2018If something is moving, it is moving either in the place\nit is in, or in the place it is not in. But it is moving neither in the\nplace it is in (for it is at rest in it [subsequently further explained\nas: \u201cfor it completely fills it\u201d]) nor in the place it is\nnot in (for it is not in it). Therefore it is not the case that\nsomething is moving\u2019 (Sextus, 10.87). This is sometimes\nattributed to Zeno of Elea, and it certainly owes some of its\ninspiration to him, but the dilemmatic form, at least, seems more\ncharacteristic of Diodorus.\n\n\n(Paradox 3) \u2018What is moving is immediately in a place. But what is in\na place is not moving. Therefore what is moving is not moving\u2019\n(Sextus, 10.112). Too brief to admit of close analysis, this looks like\na descendant of Zeno\u2019s Arrow paradox (see Zeno of Elea 2.2.3).\nHow far it can be deemed to differ, other than in form, from the first\nhorn of Diodorus\u2019s preceding dilemma is unclear.\n\n\nDiodorus\u2019s fourth motion paradox appeals to the theory of\nminima once again. It assumes that a moving body, if there were one,\nwould consist of a set of minima, and that the whole body would be\nmoving if and only if a preponderance of its constituent minima were\nmoving. The point of choosing minima as the relevant constituents is\npresumably (cf. Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism 3.76)\nto avoid the vicious regress that would threaten if everything moved by\ncourtesy of the movement of a preponderance of its parts, which\nthemselves moved by courtesy of the movement of their parts,\nand so on: minima, being defined precisely by their partlessness,\nprovide the starting point from which composite motion\u2014if there\nis such a thing\u2014would be built up. The paradox asks us to\nimagine a body consisting of three minima, two moving plus one\nstationary. Thanks to this simple majority, the whole body is in\nmotion. Hence if a further stationary minimum were now added to it,\nthat could not be enough to halt its motion, being in a minority of 1\nto the original 3, which, taken as a whole, have been assumed to be\nmoving, and therefore preponderate. And stationary minima can go on\nbeing added to the body, one at a time, until it consists of 10,000\nminima, only two of which are individually moving, and yet the whole\nbody will, absurdly, nonetheless be moving, because of the\never-increasing preponderance of its moving parts.\n\n\nSextus (10.113\u201318), who reports this paradox, thinks the fallacy\nobvious, as it no doubt is, since on the original assumption, if it is\nto be acceptable, whether a whole body is moving or not should be a\nfunction of what the majority of its minimal parts, each taken on its\nown, are doing. What is most interesting about the paradox is that it\nis a variant of the Sorites or little-by-little argument (see next\nsection), and thus clear evidence that Diodorus used to employ this\nform of argument, whose invention is in fact attributed to his\nforerunner Eubulides (see Dialectical School).\n",
