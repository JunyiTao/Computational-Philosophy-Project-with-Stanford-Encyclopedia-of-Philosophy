    "main_text": "Proper Names\n4. Proper Names\n\n\nThe Stoics had made a clear distinction between proper names and\ncommon nouns, listing them as different parts of speech, but while\nthis possibility was recognized by Priscian and the influential\ntwelfth century grammarian, Peter Helias, it was not adopted.\nAccording to Priscian, the nomen, the noun or name, is the\nfirst of the principal parts of speech, and it signifies substance\nwith quality, that is, it signifies a thing of a certain sort, or an\nindividual established in a certain nature. The nomen is\ndivided into the common or appellative name and the proper name. \nBecause the proper name is a subdivision of the name, and hence a\nfully-fledged part of the language, it is taken to have the same\nsemantic properties as the common name, and it can, indeed must, be\ntaken to have a sense. According to Priscian, the proper name\nsignifies a particular substance and its quality, and it may also\ninclude the apprehension of something common. Thus if I say\n\u2018Virgil\u2019, the common notions \u2018man\u2019 and\n\u2018poet\u2019 will be understood. Hence there are two kinds of\nsenses attached to proper names, a particular sense which cannot be\nexpressed by common notions, and an associated sense, a\ndescription.\n\n\nThere are four types of proper name according to Priscian, the\nEncyclopedist Isidore of Seville, and medieval grammarians, namely\npraenomen, nomen, cognomen, and\nagnomen. For Isidore of Seville, the nomen was the\nname of the gens or clan, a group of people with a common\nancestor, but for Priscian, Peter Helias and the modistic grammarians,\nsuch as Thomas of Erfurt, the nomen was the most properly\nproper name, that which signified an individual \u201cin an absolute\nway under the properties which gave him his individuality\u201d as\nThomas put it. The praenomen distinguished between people of\nthe same family. The cognomen was the family name, and the\nagnomen was a name, such as \u2018Africanus\u2019, given in\nhonour of some achievement, especially military. Peter Helias asked\nwhether the four types of name had the same signification, and whether\nthe cognomen was a common noun. In his reply, he made an\nexplicit distinction between a principal signification which is unique\nand a secondary signification. The cognomen principally\nsignifies an individual quality, but secondarily signifies the common\nquality of belonging to a certain family group. He added that this\ndistinction applied to all four types of proper name, and so they all\nhave the same principal signification when used of one person. This\nreinforces the claim that proper names are not equivalent to a set of\ncommon characteristics, and cannot be defined. \n",
