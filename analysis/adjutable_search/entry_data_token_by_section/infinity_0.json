Infinity in philosophy: some historical remarks\n\nIn Greek, \u2018to apeiron\u2019 means \u2018the infinite\u2019:\n\u2018a\u2019 denotes privation and \u2018peras\u2019 the notion\nof \u2018limit\u2019 or \u2018bound\u2019. Etymologically, the\nEnglish word \u2018infinite\u2019 comes from the Latin word\n\u2018infinitas\u2019: \u2018in\u2019 = \u2018not\u2019 and\n\u2018finis\u2019 = \u2018end\u2019, \u2018boundary\u2019,\n\u2018limit\u2019, \u2018termination\u2019, or \u2018determining\nfactor\u2019. In contemporary English, there is a range of uses of\nthe word \u2018infinite\u2019:\n\nIn a loose or hyperbolic sense, \u2018infinite\u2019 means\n\u2018indefinitely or exceedingly great\u2019, \u2018exceeding\nmeasurement or calculation\u2019, \u2018immense\u2019, or\n\u2018vast\u2019.\nIn a strict but non-mathematical sense that reflects its\netymological history, \u2018infinite\u2019 means \u2018having no\nlimit or end\u2019, \u2018boundless\u2019, \u2018unlimited\u2019,\n\u2018endless\u2019, \u2018immeasurably great in extent (or\nduration, or some other respect)\u2019. This strict, non-mathematical\nsense is often applied to God and divine attributes, and to space,\ntime and the universe.\nThere is also a strict, mathematical sense, according to which\n\u2018infinite\u2019 quantities or magnitudes are those that are\nmeasurable but that have no finite measure; and \u2018infinite\u2019\nlines or surfaces or volumes are measurable lines or surfaces or\nvolumes that have no finite measure.\n\n\nRelated to the distinction between meanings (2) and (3) is a\ndistinction between metaphysical and mathematical meanings of\ninfinity. This has been usefully employed in some of the most\nencompassing accounts of infinity, such as Moore (1990/2019; for\nanother recent treatment that includes extensive discussion of the\nhistory of infinity see Zellini (2005)). Moore sees the metaphysical\nnotion as bound up with the notions of \u2018totality\u2019,\n\u2018absoluteness\u2019 and \u2018perfection\u2019. While our\nentry is focused on the strict mathematical sense of\n\u2018infinity\u2019, one cannot cleanly separate the various\nmeanings in the historical development of the subject, especially in\nthe first stages. In addition, treating infinity as a\n\u2018perfection\u2019 in theology from the outset does not mirror\nthe complexity of the historical development; for instance, we find\ntraces in the 13th century of thinkers who attributed finiteness to\nGod or in any case denied God\u2019s infinity even when not\nexplicitly stating the finiteness of God (see Cot\u00e9 2002,\n127\u2013144).\n\nThe infinite has been of central concern to Western thought since the\nvery first pre-Socratic fragment. It concerned the philosopher\nAnaximander (who flourished in the 6th century BCE), who identified\nthe principle and origin of existing things as to apeiron. In\nAnaximander, the principle has both an ontological and an ethical\nsignificance. The Pythagoreans (6th century BCE) saw the infinite\nnegatively and emphasized the lack of definiteness associated with it;\nthey also gave it spatial connotations. Indeed, in the 5th century BCE\nthe Pythagorean Archytas of Tarentum (see Huffman 2005, 540\u2013550)\ngave the following argument for the spatial infinitude of the cosmos\nbased on the contradiction that postulating a boundary to it would\nseem to entail. If the cosmos is bounded, then one could extend\none\u2019s hand or a stick beyond its boundary to find either empty\nspace or matter. And this would be part of the world, which thus\ncannot be bounded on pain of contradiction. So the world is\nunbounded. Archytas identified this with the world being\ninfinite. Kant similarly identified the unbounded and the\ninfinite in his cosmological antinomy. In Section\n 8\n we will see that these notions should be distinguished, but a\nmathematically precise articulation of the distinction had to wait\nuntil the development of new conceptions of space in the 19th\ncentury.\n\nThe Eleatics (Parmenides and Melissus, 5th century BCE) held a monist\nconception of reality, the One, and Melissus declared it to be\ninfinite. Such a monistic conception of reality sees change (or\nbecoming) as appearance, and Zeno\u2019s famous paradoxes of infinity\n(see the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes)\n emerge in this context. Suffice here to say that Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes (the Achilles, the arrow, and others) involved the\ninfinitely small and were aimed at buttressing Parmenides\u2019\nmonism. Working across the 5th and the 4th century BCE, Democritus\ndefended an atomistic theory with an infinite void and infinitely many\natoms. The infinite by this time had shown some of its major aspects,\ntaken as substance by some and as plurality (of atoms, times,\ngeometrical points, etc.) by others.\n\nIf the urgency of problems related to the infinite reached Greek\nconsciousness with Zeno\u2019s paradoxes, the most influential\ndiscussion was due to Aristotle. In order to put Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion in perspective, we need to list a number of ways in which\nmathematical infinity had emerged not only in philosophy, as we have\ndescribed, but also in mathematics. We have already seen with Archytas\nthe notion of spatial infinitude of the cosmos. But in number theory,\nthe natural numbers were considered infinite, at least in the sense\nthat given any natural number a greater one could be found. In\ngeometry, we find both the infinite by addition (any segment can be\nextended) and by division (any segment can be halved). Thus,\nmathematics presented processes of iteration without limit. The most\nsophisticated technique for dealing with iterated processes in the\nmeasurements of plane and solid figures was developed by Eudoxus (4th\ncentury BCE), and we discuss it in Section\n 2.1.\n\nBy the time Aristotle (4th century BCE) developed his discussion of\nthe infinite, this concept had thus made its presence felt in\nphilosophy, mathematics, and natural philosophy (including cosmology,\nastronomy, and physics). It would be hard to exaggerate the role\nplayed by Aristotle in the history of infinity. He articulated some\nessential conceptual distinctions that were to influence all\nsubsequent discussions. He was a finitist in the sense that in his\nuniverse, everything is finite. The cosmos is finite, bodies are\nfinite, geometrical segments are finite, each number is finite, etc.\nHowever, there are processes that can be iterated indefinitely, giving\nrise to what he called \u2018potential infinity\u2019. He claimed in\nfact that \u201cin a sense [the infinite] is and in a sense it is\nnot.\u201d (Phys. 3.6, 206a13\u201314).\n\nAny arbitrary segment can be extended in length (subject to\ncosmological restrictions mentioned below) or halved without limit,\nbut at each stage we remain within the finite. Time is also\npotentially infinite in both directions and can be divided without\nlimit.\n\nThis conception stands in opposition to that of \u2018actual\ninfinity\u2019, which would result if some infinite processes could\nbe completed, carried out \u2018all at once\u2019, as it were. If\nactual infinity were real, then one could have infinitely long bodies,\ninfinitely long or infinitely small segments, the totality of natural\nnumbers, an infinite number, infinitely many instants of time, etc.\nAristotle rejected the notion of the infinite as a primordial\nsubstance, as we have encountered in Anaximander, and most of his\ndiscussion of the infinite takes place within a physical context,\nnamely one relating to spatio-temporal features of reality. As a\nconsequence, Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the infinite fell\nsquarely in what we have characterized as the\n\u2018mathematical\u2019 notion of infinity, where infinity applies\nfirst of all to magnitudes (continuous or discrete) and what is\nquantifiable (time, extension, numbers etc.). His Physics\ndiscusses the infinitely large, excluded because the world is finite;\nand the infinitely small, excluded because the division of matter can\nonly be potentially infinite and thus finite at each stage, never\nreaching an infinitesimal quantity\u2014one that is less than any\nfinite quantity, while being something. The exclusion of the\ninfinitely large also has as a consequence that Aristotle cannot allow\na potential infinity by addition in an unqualified manner (for\notherwise any finite extension could be added to itself sufficiently\nmany times to become larger than the size of the world). Infinity by\naddition, then, is to be conceptualized as a sort of inverse operation\nto infinity by division which gives us the primary evidence for the\nexistence of the potential infinite. This is the implicit force of the\ncontrastive \u201cbut\u201d in the following quote. Aristotle writes\n(our emphasis):\n\n\u2018To be\u2019, then, may mean \u2018to be\npotentially\u2019 or \u2018to be\nactually\u2019; and the infinite is either in\naddition or in division. It has been\nstated that magnitude is not in actual operation infinite; but it is\ninfinite in division \u2013 it is not hard to refute indivisible\nlines \u2013 so that it remains for the infinite to be potentially.\n(Physics 3.6, 206a14\u201324)\n\n\nThe Aristotelian distinction between potential and actual infinity has\nhad a major influence up to contemporary times. (For further\ndiscussion of Aristotle on infinity see Hintikka (1966), Lear (1980),\nKouremenos (1995), Coope (2012), Nawar (2015), Cooper (2016), Ugaglia\n(2018), and Hussey\u2019s commentary to Aristotle (1983).)\n\nAristotle\u2019s conception had, in addition to issues related to the\nconstitution of the physical continuum, important consequences in\ncosmology. While he considered the cosmos to be finite, he thought\nthat the movement of the celestial spheres had no beginning and no end\n(thus time for him, as we have noted, is potentially infinite in both\ndirections). The issue of the \u201ceternity of the world\u201d was\nto exercise some of the best theological and philosophical minds after\nAristotle, especially in connection to theological issues. For\ninstance, Johannes Philoponus (6th century CE; see Philoponus 2004)\nargued in favor of a beginning of the world by claiming that the\ncontrary thesis would lead to a paradox of infinity (we discuss this\nin Section\n 2.4).\n\nPhiloponus presented another paradox of infinity concerning infinite\ntime that we will discuss in the version formulated by\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (11th century CE)\u2014see the\n\nSupplement on al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s objection\n\n\nOf even more pressing significance was the abandonment of\nAristotle\u2019s view on the finiteness of the cosmos and the\nRenaissance move from the finite to the infinite universe described in\nthe classic text by Koyr\u00e9 (1957; see also Jammer 1993). While\nCopernicus (1473\u20131543) put the sun at the center of the\nuniverse, he still worked with a finite model of the universe.\nForeshadowed by Epicurus (341\u2013270), Hasdai Crescas\n(1340\u20131412), and Nicolaus Cusanus (1401\u20131464), Giordano\nBruno (1548\u20131600) defended the idea of infinitely many worlds,\neach of infinite size, existing simultaneously. Bruno is a good\nexample of how mathematical and theological notions of infinity were\nused simultaneously in the history of the concept. For instance, in\nOn the Infinite, the Universe, and Worlds (1584) he argued\nfrom God\u2019s infinite power to the infinitude of the universe.\n\nBy contrast, Kepler and Galileo did not think that the issue of\nwhether the world was infinite in size could be settled either way.\nKepler thought that the notion of an infinite universe was a\nmetaphysical one and not founded on empirical evidence. Galileo\nclaimed, in a famous letter to Francesco Ingoli written in 1624, that\nmankind would never be able to know whether the universe is finite or\ninfinite. The progressive geometrization of space (see De Risi 2015)\nled to Newton\u2019s gravitational theory in which the universe is\ninfinitely extended spatially and temporally. Physical space became\nidentified with the space of Euclid\u2019s geometry and in this way\nphysical space was geometrized.\n\nTheological elements were still present when Newton identified space\nwith the \u201csensorium Dei\u201d (\u201cGod\u2019s\nsensorium\u201d). For the next two centuries cosmology was developed\naccording to Newtonian theory: an infinite Euclidean space, flat and\nabsolute, which provides the receptacle for all physical objects whose\nrelations are structured by universal gravitation.\n\nWith Riemann in the mid-19th Century, and then with relativistic\ncosmology, one went back to a finite universe, but cosmologists are\nnow fully aware that the issue of the finitude of the world is very\nmuch an open question that depends crucially on the curvature and the\ntopology of space (see Section\n 8.2).\n\nOur discussion above indicates a few essential aspects of the concept\nof infinity that will be useful in the later discussion. There are\nobviously many areas of contact and/or intersection between the more\nmathematical notion of infinity and the qualitative notion of\ninfinity. Qualitative notions of infinity cannot be easily\ncharacterized directly but in general they appeal to features that do\nnot seem to have a clear quantitative aspect. For instance, God might\nbe defined as infinite because it has none of the limitations of\nfinite creatures; this property was accounted for in some Scholastic\nphilosophy by claiming that God, unlike finite creatures, is that\nunique entity in which essence and existence coincide. Often coupled\nwith this was the claim that God\u2019s infinity is incomprehensible,\nand this might be a good indicator that we cannot achieve a positive\naccount of qualitative infinity. At the same time, claims concerning\ninfinite divine power or goodness offer a possible connection to\nquantitative conceptions, and this explains why the boundary line\nbetween quantitative and qualitative conceptions is not so sharp.\n\nIndeed, according to some authors the qualitative and mathematical\nconceptions are inextricably tied. Consider for instance\nPascal\u2019s use of infinite distance both in projective geometry\nand in his Pens\u00e9es where he muses on the infinite\ndistance (and disproportion) between finite human beings and the\ninfinite God (see Cortese 2015). The following passage is\nrepresentative of the powerful and suggestive role that appeal to\nfiniteness and infinity plays in Pascal\u2019s apologetics:\n\nFor in the end what is humanity [l\u2019homme] in nature? A\nnothingness compared to the infinite, everything [un tout] compared to\na nothingness, a mid-point between nothing and everything, infinitely\nfar from understanding the extremes; the end of things and their\nbeginning [principe] are insuperably hidden for him in an impenetrable\nsecret. \\(\\langle\\)What can he therefore imagine? He is\\(\\rangle\\)\nequally incapable of seeing the nothingness from where he came, and\nthe infinite in which he is covered [englouti]. [\u2026] (Pascal\n2008: 70; we have added the French original where the translation\nseems less than faithful).\n\n\nMoreover, Pascal\u2019s pari (wager) is also intimately tied\nto the notion of infinity in the form of an infinite reward. (See\nSection\n 7.3\n on Pascal\u2019s wager) These topics are of great importance for\nphilosophy of religion, decision theory, and philosophical\nanthropology.\n\nHowever, this entry does not concern those conceptions of infinity\nthat are connected to infinite divine power, infinite modes, and in\ngeneral about those conceptions of infinity that are not of a\nmathematical kind. We do not intend to downplay the importance of\nthose aspects of the history of infinity to which giants such as\nPlotinus, Cusanus, Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Fichte, Hegel, and\nKierkegaard contributed, among others. Leibniz and Kant also belong to\nthat list, but we will say more about them later on. But our entry\nwould lose focus if we were to try to pursue all these developments\neven at a superficial level, and the treatment of qualitative infinity\nis worthy of an article in its own right. Thus, we content ourselves\nwith a list of bibliographical references through which the reader can\nreconstruct the contributions to the topic.\n\nFor overviews of the history of infinity which include both\nmathematical and metaphysical aspects, see Moore (1990/2019) and\nZellini (2005). For further discussion of Aristotle\u2019s views on\ninfinity see the entries on:\n Aristotle;\n Aristotle and mathematics; and\n Aristotle and metaphysics.\n For ancient and medieval conceptions of infinity see Sweeney (1972),\nSweeney (1992), Kretzmann (1982), Cot\u00e9 (2002), Biard and\nCeleyrette (2005), Duhem (1987), Dewender (2002), Davenport (1999),\nMurdoch (1982), Uckelman (2015); for the early modern period see\nNachtomy and Winegar (2018); for infinity in Kant and the idealist\nperiod see Kreis (2015); Monnoyeur (1992) spans all periods.\n\nFor more on infinity in philosophy of religion, see the following\nreferences.\n\non divine infinity: Koetsier and Bergmans (2005), G\u00f6cke and\nTapp (2018), the papers in the final section of Heller and Woodin\n(2011), and various entries including\n God and other ultimates,\n ontological arguments,\n Nicolaus Cusanus,\n Robert Grosseteste,\n John Duns Scotus,\n and\n Ibn Arabi;\non infinity in God\u2019s creation, apart from our subsequent\ndiscussion of whether space and time are infinite: the entries\n cosmology and theology,\n cosmological argument,\n fine-tuning,\n infinite regress arguments,\n principle of sufficient reason,\n and\n being and becoming in modern physics;\n and\non \u2018heavenly infinity\u2019, apart from our subsequent\ndiscussion of Pascal\u2019s Wager: the entries on\n Pascal\u2019s wager,\n the meaning of life, and\n religion and morality.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Cantor\u2019s development of set theory was\ninfluenced by theological considerations: see, for example, Dauben\n(1990) and Tapp (2005).\n\nAs we have said, we are mostly excluding the topic of infinity in\nscience and the social sciences from our purview, although see the\n\nSupplement on Infinite Idealizations.\n\nTo the extent that we discuss infinity in science (notably in Section\n 8),\n our focus is primarily on the mathematical machinery involved, which\nhas a venerable history. This brings us to the topic of the next\nsection.\n",
