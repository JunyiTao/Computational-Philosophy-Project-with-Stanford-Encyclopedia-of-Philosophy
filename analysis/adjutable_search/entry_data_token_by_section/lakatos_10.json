Sadly, it caused a\nmajor falling out with Popper despite the generous praise in its\nopening sections:\n\n\nPopper\u2019s ideas represent the most important development in the\nphilosophy of the twentieth century; an achievement in the\ntradition\u2014and on the level\u2014of Hume, Kant, or Whewell.\n\u2026 More than anyone else, he changed my life. I was nearly forty\nwhen I got into the magnetic field of his intellect. His philosophy\nhelped me to make a final break with the Hegelian outlook which I had\nheld for nearly twenty years. (PDI: 139.)\n\n\nMuch of the paper is devoted to criticizing Popper\u2019s demarcation\ncriterion and arguing for his own. Most of these criticisms have been\ncanvased already. Lakatos argues, for instance, that Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism can be falsified\n\n\nby showing that the best scientific achievements were unscientific [by\nPopper\u2019s standards] and that the best scientists, in their\ngreatest moments, broke the rules of Popper\u2019s game of science\n(PDI: 146).\n\n\nBut Lakatos also develops a criticism that has nothing much to do with\nthe differences between his demarcation criterion and Popper\u2019s,\nindeed a criticism that seems equally telling against Popper\u2019s\nphilosophy and his own.\n\nLakatos points out that when Popper first wrote his classic Logik\nder Forschung (LSD) in the early 1930s, the correspondence theory\nof truth was regarded with deep suspicion by the empiricist\nphilosophers that he was trying to convince. Accordingly Popper was\ncareful to state that\n\n\nin the logic of science here outlined it is possible to avoid using\nthe concepts \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d \u2026 We\nneed not say that the theory is \u201cfalse\u201d [or\n\u201cfalsified\u201d], but we may say instead that it is\ncontradicted by a certain set of accepted basic statements. Nor need\nwe say of basic statements that they are \u201ctrue\u201d or\n\u201cfalse\u201d, for we may interpret their acceptance as the\nresult of a conventional decision, and the accepted statements as\nresults of this decision. (LSD: 273\u2013274.)\n\n\nBut shortly thereafter Popper met Tarski who convinced him that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth was philosophically respectable, and\nthis liberated him to declare that truth, or truth-likeness was the\nobject of the scientific enterprise (LSD: 273n). Lakatos apparently\nendorses this development.\n\n\nTarski\u2019s rehabilitation of the correspondence theory of\ntruth\u2026stimulated Popper to complement his logic of discovery\nwith his own theory of verisimilitude and of approximation to the\nTruth, an achievement marvellous both in its simplicity and in its\nproblem-solving power. (PDI: 154.)\n\n\nBut Lakatos points out a problem. There is now a disconnect between\nthe game of science and the aim of science. The\ngame of science consists in putting forward falsifiable,\nrisky and problem-solving conjectures and sticking with the unrefuted\nand the well-corroborated ones. But the aim of science\nconsists in developing true or truth-like theories about a largely\nmind-independent world. And Popper has given us no reason to suppose\nthat by playing the game we are likely to achieve the aim. After all,\na theory can be falsifiable, unfalsified, problem-solving and\nwell-corroborated without being true.\n\nTo restore the connection between the game and its aim Lakatos makes a\nplea with Popper for a \u201cwhiff of\n\u2018inductivism\u2019\u201d (PDI: 159). What is this whiff?\n\n\nAn inductive principle which connects realist metaphysics with\nmethodological appraisals, verisimilitude with corroboration, which\nreinterprets the rules of the \u201cscientific game\u201d as\na\u2014conjectural\u2014theory about the signs of the\ngrowth of knowledge, that is, about the signs of growing\nverisimilitude of our scientific theories (PDI: 156).\n\n\nIn other words, it is a metaphysical principle which states that\nhighly falsifiable but well-corroborated theories are (in some sense)\nmore likely to be true (or truth-like) than their low-risk\ncounterparts. Corroborations tend to confirm. Thus by playing the game\nwe approximate the aim. Lakatos goes on to urge that this whiff of\ninductivism is not much of an ask, since Popper sometimes seems to\npresuppose it without fully realizing that he is doing so.\n\nThere are three points to note.\n\n(1) If this criticism holds good against Popper it is equally good\nagainst Lakatos himself. He too has a disconnect between the\ngame of science\u2014which, when it is played well, consists\nin developing progressive research programmes\u2014and the\naim of science\u2014which, like Popper, he takes to be truth\n(FMSRP: 58). To solve this problem, we need a metaphysical principle\nwhich states that highly progressive research programmes are (in some\nsense) more likely to be true (or truth-like) than their degenerating\nrivals. Thus if Popper could do with a whiff of inductivism, the same\ngoes for Lakatos.\n\n(2) The inductivism that Lakatos recommends to Popper looks remarkably\nlike the inductivism that he condemned in Russell. (\u201cI do not\nsee any way out of a dogmatic assertion that we know the\ninductive principle, or some equivalent; the only alternative is to\nthrow over almost everything that is regarded as knowledge by science\nand common sense.\u201d Russell 1944: 683, quoted disdainfully by\nLakatos at Regress: 18.) But if inductivism is\npermissible (or even de rigueur) in the Philosophy of\nScience, perhaps it is permissible (or even de rigueur) in\nthe Philosophy of Mathematics! In which case, the Renaissance of\nEmpiricism in the Philosophy of Mathematics may count as a genuine\nrenaissance after all, since the logical or set-theoretic axioms may\n(as Russell supposed) be confirmed (and hence rationally believed)\nbecause of their mathematical consequences. If epistemic support can\nflow upwards from evidence to theory (where the evidence consists of a\nsequence of novel and successful predictions), perhaps it can flow\nupwards from consequences to axioms.\n\n(3) This episode undermines an influential \u201cHegelian\u201d\nreading of Lakatos due to Ian Hacking. According to Hacking,\n\n\nLakatos, educated in Hungary in an Hegelian and Marxist tradition,\ntook for granted the post-Kantian, Hegelian, demolition of\ncorrespondence theories (Hacking 1983: 118).\n\n\nThis is an odd assertion as Lakatos explicitly endorses the\ncorrespondence theory on a number of occasions and even declares truth\nto be the aim of science, which is why contradictions are intolerable\nin the long term (FMSRP: 58). But in Hacking\u2019s view, Lakatos\nwas\n\n\ndown on truth, not just a particular theory of truth. He [did] not\nwant a replacement for the correspondence theory, but a replacement\nfor truth itself (Hacking 1983: 119).\n\n\nHe found his replacement in the concept of progress.\n\n\nLakatos then defines objectivity and rationality in terms of\nprogressive research programmes, and allows an incident in the history\nof science to be objective and rational if its internal history can be\nwritten as a sequence of progressive problem shifts (Hacking 1983:\n126).\n\n\nProgress becomes a surrogate for truth. We don\u2019t ask whether a\ntheory is true or not but only whether it is part of a progressive\nprogramme. To paraphrase the young Karl Popper,\n\n\nin the logic of science [that Lakatos has] outlined it is possible to\navoid using the concepts \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d\n[which, in Lakatos\u2019s opinion, is a jolly good thing!] (LSD:\n273).\n\n\nBut if Lakatos had really been such an anti-truth-freak, he would not\nhave congratulated Popper on his Tarskian turn. Rather he would have\ncondemned him for taking the vacuous concept of truth to be the aim of\nscience. As for the disconnect between the aim of science and\nthe game of science, he would have recommended that Popper\nresolve it by dropping the aim and substituting the game (which,\naccording to Hacking, was what Lakatos himself was trying to do). If\ntruth were not the object of the exercise, there would be no need for\na whiff of inductivism to connect Popper\u2019s method with\nscience\u2019s ultimate objective. But Lakatos did think\nthat a whiff of inductivism was needed to connect Popper\u2019s\nmethod with science\u2019s objective. Hence Lakatos believed that\ntruth was the object of the scientific enterprise. Whatever the\nremnants of Hegelianism that Lakatos retained in later life, an\naversion to truth (or to the correspondence theory of truth ) was not\none of them.\n",
