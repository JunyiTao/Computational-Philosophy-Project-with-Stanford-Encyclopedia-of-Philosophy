    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nWork in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has produced computer programs\nthat can beat the world chess champion, control autonomous vehicles,\ncomplete our email sentences, and defeat the best human players on the\ntelevision quiz show Jeopardy. AI has also produced programs\nwith which one can converse in natural language, including customer\nservice \u201cvirtual agents\u201d, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa and\nApple\u2019s Siri. Our experience shows that playing chess or\nJeopardy, and carrying on a conversation, are activities that\nrequire understanding and intelligence. Does computer prowess at\nconversation and challenging games then show that computers can\nunderstand language and be intelligent? Will further development\nresult in digital computers that fully match or even exceed human\nintelligence?\n Alan Turing\n (1950), one of the pioneer theoreticians of computing, believed the\nanswer to these questions was \u201cyes\u201d. Turing proposed what\nis now known as\n \u2018The Turing Test\u2019:\n if a computer can pass for human in online chat, we should grant that\nit is intelligent. By the late 1970s some AI researchers claimed that\ncomputers already understood at least some natural language. In 1980\nU.C. Berkeley philosopher John Searle introduced a short and\nwidely-discussed argument intended to show conclusively that it is\nimpossible for digital computers to understand language or think.\n\nSearle argues that a good way to test a theory of mind, say a theory\nthat holds that understanding can be created by doing such and such,\nis to imagine what it would be like to actually do what the theory\nsays will create understanding. Searle (1999) summarized his Chinese\nRoom Argument (herinafter, CRA) concisely:\n\nImagine a native English speaker who knows no Chinese locked in a room\nfull of boxes of Chinese symbols (a data base) together with a book of\ninstructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that\npeople outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown\nto the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And\nimagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in\nthe room is able to pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers\nto the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the\nroom to pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese but he does not\nunderstand a word of Chinese.\n\n\nSearle goes on to say, \u201cThe point of the argument is this: if\nthe man in the room does not understand Chinese on the basis of\nimplementing the appropriate program for understanding Chinese then\nneither does any other digital computer solely on that basis because\nno computer, qua computer, has anything the man does not\nhave.\u201d\n\nThirty years after introducing the CRA Searle 2010 describes the\nconclusion in terms of consciousness and\n intentionality:\n\nI demonstrated years ago with the so-called Chinese Room Argument that\nthe implementation of the computer program is not by itself sufficient\nfor consciousness or intentionality (Searle 1980). Computation is\ndefined purely formally or syntactically, whereas minds have actual\nmental or semantic contents, and we cannot get from syntactical to the\nsemantic just by having the syntactical operations and nothing else.\nTo put this point slightly more technically, the notion \u201csame\nimplemented program\u201d defines an equivalence class that is\nspecified independently of any specific physical realization. But such\na specification necessarily leaves out the biologically specific\npowers of the brain to cause cognitive processes. A system, me, for\nexample, would not acquire an understanding of Chinese just by going\nthrough the steps of a computer program that simulated the behavior of\na Chinese speaker (p.17).\n\n\n\u201cIntentionality\u201d is a technical term for a feature of\nmental and certain other things, namely being about something. Thus a\ndesire for a piece of chocolate and thoughts about real Manhattan or\nfictional Harry Potter all display intentionality, as will be\ndiscussed in more detail in section 5.2 below.\n\nSearle\u2019s shift from machine understanding to consciousness and\nintentionality is not directly supported by the original 1980\nargument. However the re-description of the conclusion indicates the\nclose connection between understanding and consciousness in\nSearle\u2019s later accounts of meaning and intentionality. Those who\ndon\u2019t accept Searle\u2019s linking account might hold that\nrunning a program can create understanding without necessarily\ncreating consciousness, and conversely a fancy robot might have dog\nlevel consciousness, desires, and beliefs, without necessarily\nunderstanding natural language.\n\nIn moving to discussion of intentionality Searle seeks to develop the\nbroader implications of his argument. It aims to refute the\n functionalist\n approach to understanding minds, that is, the approach that holds\nthat mental states are defined by their causal roles, not by the stuff\n(neurons, transistors) that plays those roles. The argument counts\nespecially against that form of functionalism known as\n  the Computational Theory of Mind\n that treats minds as information processing systems. As a result of\nits scope, as well as Searle\u2019s clear and forceful writing style,\nthe Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed\nphilosophical argument in cognitive science to appear since the Turing\nTest. By 1991 computer scientist Pat Hayes had defined Cognitive\nScience as the ongoing research project of refuting Searle\u2019s\nargument. Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker (1997) pointed out that\nby the mid-1990s well over 100 articles had been published on\nSearle\u2019s thought experiment \u2013 and that discussion of it\nwas so pervasive on the Internet that Pinker found it a compelling\nreason to remove his name from all Internet discussion lists. \n\nThis interest has not subsided, and the range of connections with the\nargument has broadened. A search on Google Scholar for \u201cSearle\nChinese Room\u201d limited to the period from 2010 through 2019\nproduced over 2000 results, including papers making connections\nbetween the argument and topics ranging from embodied cognition to\ntheater to talk psychotherapy to postmodern views of truth and\n\u201cour post-human future\u201d \u2013 as well as discussions of\ngroup or collective minds and discussions of the role of intuitions in\nphilosophy. In 2007 a game company took the name \u201cThe Chinese\nRoom\u201d in joking honor of \u201c...Searle\u2019s critique of AI\n\u2013 that you could create a system that gave the impression of\nintelligence without any actual internal smarts.\u201d This\nwide-range of discussion and implications is a tribute to the\nargument\u2019s simple clarity and centrality. \n",
