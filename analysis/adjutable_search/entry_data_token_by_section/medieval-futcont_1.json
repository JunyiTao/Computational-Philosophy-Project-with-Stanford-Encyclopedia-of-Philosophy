Medieval Developments from Abelard to Aquinas\n\nIn discussing statements such as \u201cWhat is known by God\nnecessarily takes place\u201d, Anselm of Canterbury (1033\u20131109)\ndistinguished between the antecedent and consequent necessity of\nthings which are known. The latter is the necessity of a thing\u2019s\nactuality which is caused by the actuality of the thing itself. The\nformer is the necessity by which a thing exists because of an external\ncause (Cur Deus homo 2.17, 125.6\u2013126.2). Neither\nantecedent knowledge nor antecedent truth has a compelling effect on\nthings. In explaining Mary\u2019s believing the truth of a prophetic\nstatement concerning the death of Christ, Anselm writes:\n\n\nTherefore, since her faith was true faith, it was necessary that things\nwould be as she believed. But if you are once again disturbed by my\nsaying \u201cIt was necessary\u2026\u201d, remember that the\ntruth of the virgin\u2019s faith was not the cause of his dying\nfreely but that her faith was true faith because this was going to\nhappen. (Cur Deus homo 2.17, 124.27\u2013125.3)\n\n\nAnselm thought that future contingent statements based on divine\nrevelation were true without deterministic implications. A similar\nview was held by most medieval theologians when they addressed divine\nomniscience and prophesy. For Anselm\u2019s view, see Knuuttila\n2004.\n\nWilliam of Champeaux (c. 1070\u20131122) dealt with an argument\nagainst the compatibility between contingency and divine omniscience\nwhich was discussed in Augustine\u2019s City of God (V.9).\nIn response to Cicero\u2019s De fato and De\ndivinatione, Augustine refuted the claim that if events can\nhappen in any way other than God has foreseen, then God can be in\nerror. William stated that the antecedent of the argument is true but\nthe consequent is false and therefore the consequence is not valid\n(Lottin 1959: 195; Marenbon 1997: 226\u2013227). Peter Abelard\n(1079\u20131142/4), in discussing the same example, applied the\nsystematic division between modal statements de sensu or in\nthe compounded sense and modal statements de re or in the\ndivided sense. (For Abelard\u2019s modal terminology, see Glossae\nsuper Peri hermeneias XII.3\u201346. Later authors used the\nexpression de dicto instead of de sensu.)\nAbelard\u2019s analysis of Cicero\u2019s argument was often repeated\nin medieval theology, since it was put forward in slightly modified\nform in Peter Lombard\u2019s Sententiae (c. 1157), which\nbecame the standard medieval introduction to theology. Abelard states\nthat when the proposition \u201cA thing can be otherwise than God\nknows it to be\u201d is read as a modal proposition de sensu\n(It is possible that a thing is otherwise than God knows it to\nbe), the antecedent is false and the possibility of God\u2019s\nerror as a consequent would not be justified even if the consequence\nwere valid. When the antecedent is read de re (A thing\nthat is now somehow could be otherwise than God knows it to\nbe), the proposition is true, but the consequent about\nGod\u2019s error is false, for if things were otherwise, God would\nknow as they would be. This shows that the consequence is not well\nformulated. Following Abelard, Peter Lombard formulated the same view\nin stating that \u201cThings cannot be other than as God foreknows\nthem\u201d is true in the compounded sense and false in the divided\nsense. The truth of the compounded sense saves God\u2019s\ninfallibility and the falsity of the divided sense expresses\nGod\u2019s freedom and the metaphysical contingency of the future\n(Peter Lombard, Sententiae I.38.2; Peter Abelard, Glossae\nsuper Peri hermeneias IX.86\u201399; Dialectica,\n217.27\u2013219.24). It is assumed here that when a temporally\ndefinite statement is true, its denial may be possibly true. \n\nEarly medieval logicians could deal with singular future statements as\nstatement types with truth-values changing in accordance with the time\nof assertion, as in Aristotle and Hellenistic philosophy. (For the\nprevalence of temporally indefinite sentences in ancient philosophy,\nsee Hintikka 1973: Ch. 4; Bobzien 1998: 66\u201367, 100\u2013101,\n109\u2013111.) In the theological context of timeless divine\nomniscience, it was more natural to regard these statements as\ntemporally definite. Abelard calls statements propositions\n(propositio) and what is asserted by a statement its\ndictum. He considered that a statement is true or false when\nits dictum is true or false. In dealing with prophesy,\nAbelard suggested that the dictum about a singular event is\nfirst expressed by a future tense proposition and then by present and\npast tense propositions. (For the nature of the dictum,\ncontrasted with the \u2018facts\u2019 and \u2018propositions\u2019\nof twentieth-century philosophical jargon, see Marenbon 1997:\n202\u2013209). The view of a fixed propositional content was\ndeveloped further by twelfth-century authors who were later called\nnominales. One of the theses of this group was \u201cWhat is\nonce true is always true\u201d. (See Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 196,\n199\u2013201, 205\u2013206 for the relevant texts. For the history\nof the principle, see also Marenbon 1992: 58\u201361 and Ebbesen\n1992: 73\u201374.) This thesis was employed in the discussions of how\nthe beliefs of Abraham and others who lived before the coming of\nChrist and believed various things about him were the same as the\nbeliefs of those who live after His coming. The reason for asking this\nwas that the previous beliefs were formulated in future tense\nstatements and the latter in present or past tense statements.\nAccording to the nominales, one could regard as basic a\ntemporally definite propositional content the meaning of which is\nexpressed by various tensed expressions depending on when they are\nuttered. While tensed statements about temporally definite singular\nevents have a changing truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed\ndicta are unchangingly true or false (Nuchelmans 1973:\n177\u2013189; for some later examples, see also Nuchelmans 1980;\nLewis 1995; Goris 2001). Peter of Poitiers (c. 1130\u20131205), one\nof the authors taking this approach, argued that while the singular\nstatements about contingent things are immutably true or false because\nof God\u2019s eternal choice, their unchanging truth-value could be\notherwise. God does not know contingent things through tensed\nstatements, since their truth-value is changeable. If God\u2019s\nknowledge is described by using tensed statements, analogously to the\narticles of faith before and after the coming of Christ, one should\nread them so that they signify the same (Peter of Poitiers,\nSententiae I.7, 133\u2013143; I.12.199\u2013223;\nI.14.328\u2013253). This became a well-known position since it was\nalso employed in Peter Lombard\u2019s Sententiae (I.39.1;\nI.41.3).\n\nThe theological formulations by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard and Peter\nof Poitiers discussed above exemplify twelfth-century deviations from\nthe Aristotelian thesis \u201cWhat is necessarily is when it\nis\u201d. This was traditionally understood as implying the principle\nof the necessity of the present, which was not questioned in ancient\nmodal theories (Knuuttila 1993: Ch. 1). Since God\u2019s knowledge\nabout contingent things was regarded as unchangeable, the contingency\nof this knowledge (in the sense that it could be different) also\nimplied the denial of the Aristotelian equation of immutability with\nnecessity, a denial regarded as an explicit doctrine of the\nnominales (Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 194). The new modal\nparadigm, which is more or less consciously applied in these\ndiscussions of God\u2019s will, power, and knowledge, could be\ncharacterized as the model of simultaneous or synchronic alternatives.\nThere are three main examples of it in early medieval philosophy. \n\nAbelard assumes that at a given instant of time, what is actual is\nnecessary as no longer avoidable, but he argues that unrealized\nalternatives are possible at the same time in the sense that they\ncould have happened at that time. Some of the alternatives of a\nsingular being are real counterfactual alternatives. These are\nunrealizable because of some previous change in the conditions of the\nsubject, and some are merely imaginable alternatives, such as\nSocrates\u2019s being a bishop, which never had a real basis in\nthings. While often employing traditional ideas about necessity and\npossibility, Abelard also developed ideas pertaining to simultaneous\nalternatives. (See Martin 2003; Knuuttila 2008: 537\u2013538.)\n\nGilbert of Poitiers (1085/90\u20131154) stressed the idea that\nnatural regularities which are called natural necessities are not\nabsolute, since they are chosen by God and can be overridden by divine\npower. This had become a widespread theological view in\nGilbert\u2019s time. Gilbert explained it in the light of the\nAugustinian view of God\u2019s acting by choice between alternative\nprovidential options and omnipotence as an executive power. There is\nan interesting formulation of Plato\u2019s \u2018Platonitas\u2019\nin Gilbert. This is said to include all of what Plato was, is and will\nbe as well as what he could be but never is. Even though Gilbert does\nnot explain why there is a modal element in the individual concept, it\nwas probably needed in order to speak about Plato in alternative\npossible histories or, as in Abelard, about Socrates as a bishop.\nGilbert seems to have been the first to formulate an individual\nconcept in this way (Knuuttila 1993, 75\u201382; Marenbon 2007: 158\u2013159).\n\nA third context of the systematic interest in simultaneous\nalternatives was the new twelfth-century theory that declarative\nsingular statements or their contents should be primarily treated as\ntemporally definite and as having an unchanging truth-value. All\npropositional contents pertaining to contingent things have a\ntruth-value on the basis of God\u2019s eternal choice. These\ntruth-values would be otherwise if the providential design of the\nworld were different in relevant respects. Robert Grosseteste\n(1168/75\u20131253) taught that the opposites of actualized\ncontingent things are no longer realizable possibilities, though they\nare possible alternatives in the sense that they could have been\nincluded in God\u2019s eternal providential choice. Actual history is\nan explication of one of the divine alternatives with respect to which\nthings are primarily called necessary, possible or impossible.\nNecessities and possibilities at this basic level are called\nmodalities \u2018from eternity and without beginning\u2019.\nMathematical truths exemplify these \u2018simple\u2019 necessities.\nIn addition, there are necessities and impossibilities which have a\nbeginning and which are eternal contingencies in the sense that they\ndepend on God\u2019s free choice (De libero arbitrio\n168.26\u2013170.33; 178.28\u201329). The contingency of the divine\nacts of knowledge and will is associated with an atemporal causal\npriority between the powers and their acts (178.24\u201326).\nGrosseteste\u2019s views are compared with those of Duns Scotus in\nLewis (1996).\n\nThis was an innovative theory for dealing with future contingent\nstatements as omnitemporally true or omnitemporally false or, if these\nwere tensed, as antecedently true or antecedently false. The\ntruth-values of statements about contingent things, though temporally\nimmutable from the beginning of the world and also immutably known by\nGod, were metaphysically contingent. The consequence from knowledge or\ntruth to necessity, whether causal or semantic, was denied. The\ncontingency of the created order was based on God\u2019s eternal and and\nfree providential choice that involved the acts of the created will as free.\nAnselm formulated this traditional view, following Augustine, as\nfollows: \u201cIt is both necessary that God foreknows what will come\nto be and that God foreknows that something will freely come to\nbe\u201d (De concordia praescientiae et praedestinationis et\ngratiae Dei cum libero arbitrio, 1.1; cf. Augustine, On Free\nChoice of the Will, 3.3.8). Anselm argued that that predictions\nare true or false and their truth can be understood as the\ncorrespondence to what will happen, although what will contingently\nhappen is not known to human beings without supernatural help. This\nwas the standard view of the possibility of prophesy. (See the above\nquotation from Anselm\u2019s Cur Deus homo; Peter Abelard,\nGlossae super Peri hermeneias, IX.69\u201385; Anonymous,\nSumma Duacensis, 129\u2013130.)\n\nEarly medieval authors were well acquainted with the conception of\nGod\u2019s eternal and timeless knowledge in Augustine and Boethius.\nThis aspect of the question of the divine knowledge and future\ncontingents became a central issue in Thomas Aquinas, who discussed\nthe philosophical theory of future contingents by following Aristotle\nand Boethius rather than twelfth-century innovators. According to\nAquinas, God atemporally grasps all combinations of things in\nparticular times by one eternal vision. Temporal things are timelessly\npresent to God, who has direct knowledge of them and their temporal\norder, though none of them is past or future with respect to His\ncognition (Scriptum super libros Sententiarum I.38.1.4\u20135; Summa contra\ngentiles I.66; Summa theologiae I.14.9, 14). Things seen\nas actual are necessary by supposition (i. e., with respect to\nGod\u2019s knowledge and providence), but many of them are contingent\nwith respect to their proximate causes (Scriptum super libros Sententiarum I.38.1.5,\nSumma contra gentiles I.67, Summa theologiae I,\n14.13, De veritate 2.12). The ultimate source of the\nactuality of the created order is the divine free will (In libros \nPerihermeneias I.14, 197). Aquinas assumes that a metaphysical view of\nthe truth or falsity of all temporally definite propositions implies\nthat everything happens of necessity (In libros Perihermeneias I.13,\n173). In order to avoid this wrong idea, one should deal with future\ncontingent propositions like Boethius as disjunctively true or false.\nTheir definite truth-values known by supernatural omniscience are\nbeyond human cognitive capacities, except the various degrees of\nprobabilities corresponding to certain types of causes (In\nlibros Perihermeneias I.13, 172, 174). However, in the doctrine of divine\nprovidence, all historical propositions are definitely true. This is\ncalled Aquinas\u2019s providential determinism (Porro 2013:\n121\u2013127; Posti 2017: 82). While there are prophetic predictions\nof future contingents through a revelatory participation in divine\nknowledge, their truth remains a supernatural matter (Summa\ntheologiae II\u20132, 171.3, 6). Speaking about God\u2019s atemporal\nknowledge as divine prescience is a temporal projection of the divine\nmode of knowing. For various interpretations of Aquinas\u2019s view,\nsee Wippel 1985; Craig 1988: 99\u2013126; Goris 1996; Marenbon 2005;\nKnuuttila 2010.\n\nMedieval critics found the allegedly Thomist idea of the presence of\neach instant of time to God\u2019s non-temporal eternal vision\nproblematic because of the transitivity and symmetry of the relation\nof simulaneity. (See John Duns Scotus, Lectura\nI.39.1\u20135, 23, 28, 87, and further references in Hoenen 1993:\n169\u201370.) One could also ask how Aquinas\u2019s view of\nGod\u2019s essential simplicity and immutability is compatible with\nthe view that God\u2019s eternal choice could be otherwise and the\nvoluntary acts of created beings could be other than what is known by\nGod (see Stump 2003: 100\u2013127).\n",
