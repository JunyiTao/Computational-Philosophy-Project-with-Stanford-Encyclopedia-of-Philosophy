    "main_text": "Varieties of Functionalism || Psychofunctionalism\n3.4 Psychofunctionalism\n\nIn contrast to the scientific behaviorists\u2019 insistence that the\nlaws of psychology appeal only to behavioral dispositions, cognitive\npsychologists argue that the best empirical theories of behavior take\nit to be the result of a complex of mental states and processes,\nintroduced and individuated in terms of the roles they play in\nproducing the behavior to be explained. For example (Fodor\u2019s, in\nhis 1968, Ch. 3), a psychologist may begin to construct a theory of\nmemory by postulating the existence of \u201cmemory trace\u201d\ndecay, a process whose occurrence or absence is responsible for\neffects such as memory loss and retention, and which is affected by\nstress or emotion in certain distinctive ways.\n\nOn a theory of this sort, what makes some neural process an instance\nof memory trace decay is a matter of how it functions, or the role it\nplays, in a cognitive system; its neural or chemical properties are\nrelevant only insofar as they enable that process to do what trace\ndecay is hypothesized to do. And similarly for all mental states and\nprocesses invoked by cognitive psychological theories. Cognitive\npsychology, that is, is intended by its proponents to be a\n\u201chigher-level\u201d science like biology, and thus to have\nautonomy from lower-level sciences such as neurophysiology: just as,\nin biology, physically disparate entities can all be hearts as long as\nthey function to circulate blood in a living organism, and physically\ndisparate entities can all be eyes as long as they enable an organism\nto see, disparate physical structures or processes can be instances of\nmemory trace decay \u2013 or more familiar phenomena such as\nthoughts, sensations, and desires \u2013 as long as they play the\nroles described by the relevant cognitive theory.\n\nPsychofunctionalism, therefore, can be seen as straightforwardly\nadopting the methodology of cognitive psychology in its\ncharacterization of mental states and processes as entities defined by\ntheir role in a cognitive psychological theory. What distinguishes it\nfrom analytic functionalism is that the information used in the\nfunctional characterization of mental states and processes\nneedn\u2019t be restricted to what is considered common knowledge or\ncommon sense, but can include information available only by careful\nempirical observation and experimentation. For example, a\npsychofunctional theory might be able to distinguish phenomena such as\ndepression from sadness or listlessness even though the distinctive\ncauses and effects of these syndromes are difficult to untangle solely\nby consulting intuitions or appealing to common sense. And\npsychofunctional theories will not include characterizations of mental\nstates for which there is no scientific evidence, such as\nbuyer\u2019s regret or hysteria, even if the existence and efficacy\nof such states is something that common sense affirms.\n\nThis may seem to be an unmitigated advantage, since psychofunctional\ntheories can avail themselves of all the tools of inquiry available to\nscientific psychology, and will presumably make all, and only, the\ndistinctions that are scientifically sound. This methodology, however,\nleaves psychofunctionalism open to the charge that it, like the\nPsycho-Physical Identity Thesis, may be overly\n\u201cchauvinistic\u201d (Block 1980b), since creatures whose\ninternal states share the rough, but not fine-grained, causal patterns\nof ours wouldn\u2019t count as sharing our mental states. Many\npsychofunctionalists, however, may not regard this as an unhappy\nconsequence, and argue that it\u2019s appropriate to treat only those\nwho are psychologically similar as having the same mental states.\n\nBut there is another serious worry about the thesis, namely, that if\nthe laws of the best empirical psychological theories diverge from\neven the broad contours of our \u201cfolk psychology\u201d \u2013\nthat is, our common sense beliefs about the causal roles of our\nthoughts, sensations, and perceptions \u2013 it will be hard to take\npsychofunctional theories as providing an account of our mental\nstates, rather than merely changing the subject (Loar 1981, Stich\n1983, Greenwood 1991, Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996/2007). Many\ntheorists, however (Horgan and Woodward 1985), argue that it\u2019s\nlikely that future psychological theories will be recognizably close\nto \u201cfolk psychology\u201d, though this question has been the\nsubject of debate (Churchland 1981).\n\nYet another reason that some prefer analytic functionalism derives\nfrom a debate that occurred in the early days of the Psycho-Physical\nIdentity Theory, the thesis that each type of mental state can be\nidentified with some type of brain state or neural activity. For\nexample, early identity theorists (e.g. Smart 1959) argued that it\nmakes perfect sense (and may well be true) to identify pain\nwith C-fiber stimulation. The terms \u2018pain\u2019 and\n\u2018C-fiber stimulation\u2019, they acknowledged, do not have the\nsame meaning, but nonetheless they can denote the same state;\nthe fact that an identity statement is not a priori, they argued, does\nnot mean that it is not true. And just because I need not consult some\nsort of brain scanner when reporting that I\u2019m in pain\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the pain I report is not a neural state that a\nbrain scanner could (in principle) detect.\n\nAn important \u2013 and enduring \u2013 objection to this argument,\nhowever, was raised early on by Max Black (reported in Smart 1959).\nBlack argued, following Frege (1892), that the only way that terms\nwith different meanings can denote the same state is to express (or\nconnote) different properties, or \u201cmodes of presentation\u201d,\nof that state. But this implies, he argued, that if terms like\n\u2018pain\u2019, \u2018thought\u2019 and \u2018desire\u2019 are\nnot equivalent in meaning to any physicalistic descriptions, they can\ndenote physical states only by expressing irreducibly mental\nproperties of them. This argument has come to be known as the\n\u201cDistinct Property Argument\u201d, and was taken by its\nproponents to undermine a thorough-going materialistic theory of the\nmind. \n\nIn response, Smart (1959) and later, Armstrong (1968) countered that\nthere could be relational, \u201ctopic-neutral\u201d terms that are\nequivalent in meaning to terms such as \u2018pain\u2019,\n\u2018thought\u2019, and \u2018desire\u2019, and if so, then there\nare properties distinct from physical properties by virtue of which\nmental state terms can denote brain states, yet are not irreducibly\nmental. However, Smart\u2019s and Armstrong\u2019s suggestions were\nwidely regarded as inadequate. The appeal of meaning-preserving\nfunctional characterizations, therefore, derives from their promise to\nprovide more plausible topic-neutral equivalents of our mental state\nterms and concepts and thereby blunt the anti-materialistic force of\nthe Distinct Property Argument. (See Lewis 1966).\n\nStill, though many regard functional characterizations as an\nimprovement on the earlier attempts by Smart and Armstrong, there is a\ndispute about whether any relational characterizations of our mental\nstates, especially sensations, could fully preserve the meanings of\nour mental state terms. On the other hand, there is a dispute about\nhow seriously to take the Distinct Property objection. (See White 1986\nand 2007, for more recent versions of this objection, and Block 2007,\nand Levin, 2020, for a response; these questions will be addressed\nmore fully in Section 5.5.)\n\nThere is yet another distinction between kinds of functional theory\n\u2013 one that crosscuts the distinctions described so far \u2013\nthat is important to note. This is the distinction between what has\ncome to be known as \u201crole\u201d functionalism and\n\u201crealizer\u201d (or \u201cfiller\u201d) functionalism\n(McLaughlin 2006).\n",
