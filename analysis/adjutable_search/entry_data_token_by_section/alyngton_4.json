    "main_text": "The Absolute Accidents\n5. The Absolute Accidents\n\nSince Alyngton thinks of primary substances as the ultimate substrates\nof existence in relation to anything else, the only way to safeguard\nthe reality of accidents as well as their distinction from substance\nand from each other, while at the same time, to affirm their\ndependence on substance in existence, was to conceive of them as forms\nof the substance itself, and therefore as something existentially\nincomplete. Accordingly, like Wyclif, he insists that quantity,\nquality, and relations, considered as abstract accidents, are forms\ninherent in primary substances, whereas, if considered from the point\nof view of their actual existence as concrete items, they are not\nreally distinct from the substance in which they are present, but only\nformally, as they are modes of substances. So, the chief features of\nAlyngton\u2019s treatment of accidents are his twofold consideration\nof them as abstract forms and as concrete properties as well as his\ncommitment to their objective reality, since, in his opinion, they are\nmind-independent items of the world in both cases. Hence, the main\ngoals of his reading of the chapters 6\u20138 of the Aristotelian\ntreatise are showing the ordered internal structure of the chief\ncategories of accidents, and reasserting their reality and real\ndistinction from the category of substance, against those thinkers,\nlike Ockham and his followers, who had attempted to reduce quantity\nand relations to mere aspects of material substances.\n\n1. (Quantity) According to the standard realist\ninterpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine of the categories,\nfollowed also by Alyngton among the nine genera of accidents, quantity\nis the most important one, as it is the basis of all further\naccidents, since quantity orders material substances for receiving\nquality and the other accidental forms (In Cat., cap. de\nquantitate, fol. 106r). On the contrary, Ockham had claimed that\nit was superfluous to posit quantitative forms really distinct from\nsubstance and quality, since quantity presupposes what it is intended\nto explain, that is, the extension of material substances and their\nhaving parts outside parts. As an accident, quantity needs substance\nas its substrate of inherence (cf. Ockham, Expositio in librum\nPraedicamentorum Aristotelis, cap. 10.4, in Opera\nphilosophica, vol. 2, pp. 205\u201324). Like Burley and Wyclif,\nAlyngton denies that material substance can be actually extended\nwithout the presence of the general form of quantity in it, thereby\naffirming its necessity. Hence, he tries to confute Ockham\u2019s\nargumentation. He thinks that the existence of quantity always implies\nthat of substance, but he also believes that the actual existence of\nparts in a substance necessarily implies the presence of a general\nform of quantity in it, really distinct from the substance (say\nSocrates) in which it inheres, and formally distinct from the fact,\ngrounded on the substance at issue, that this same substance is a\nquantified thing. For Alyngton, what characterizes quantity and\ndifferentiates it from the other accidental forms, and in particular\nfrom quality, are the following features: (1) being the appropriate\nmeasure of anything, and (2) being an absolute entity which makes it\npossible that material substances actually have parts outside parts\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fols. 106v, 107r,\n114v).\n\nIf the highest genus of the category of quantity is a form, the seven\nspecies Aristotle enumerates (line, surface, solid, time, place,\nnumber, and speech) clearly are not. Alyngton tries to meet this\ndifficulty by reformulating the notion of quantified-thing\n(quantum), and by proposing a method for deducing the seven\nspecies of quantity from the highest genus (a sort of sufficientia\nquantitatum). He considers the seven species Aristotle lists not\nas quantitative forms, but as the most proper and primary bearers of\nthe quantitative nature, revealed by the highest genus of the\ncategory. In fact, encouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between\nstrict and derivative quantities (Categories 6,\n5a38\u2013b10), like Burley, he distinguishes two different ways of\nbeing quantified: by itself and accidentally (per accidens).\nOnly the seven species of quantity would be quanta by\nthemselves, while any other quantum would be such per\naccidens, and so indirectly, because of its connection to one (or\nmore) of the seven quanta per se (In Cat., cap.\nde quantitate, fol. 116r).\n\nIn Alyngton\u2019s view, the seven species of quantity correspond to\nthe seven possible ways of measuring the being (esse) of the\nmaterial substance. In fact, substance has two main kinds of being:\npermanent and in succession. And both of them can be either discrete\nor continuous. In turn, the being permanent and continuous of material\nsubstance can be measured either from inside or from outside. If from\ninside, then in three different modes: according to one, two or all\nthe three dimensions proper to material substances. In the first case,\nthe measure is line, in the second surface, and in the third solid. If\nit is measured from outside, then it is place. The being of material\nsubstance which is permanent and discrete is measured by numbers. The\nbeing which is in succession and continuous is measured by time. And\nfinally, the being of substance which is in succession and discrete is\nmeasured by the quantity called \u2018speech\u2019 (oratio)\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fol.\n107r\u2013v).\n\nAlyngton\u2019s derivation of the seven species of quantity from a\nunique principle common to them is unconvincing, but extremely\ninteresting, nonetheless, as it clearly shows that he wants to stress\nthe unity of the category of quantity, which at first appears\nheterogeneous, and to trace the problem of reality and real\ndistinction of quantities back to that of the nature and status of its\ndistinctive mark.\n\n2. (Quality) The chapter on quality is the least complex and\ninteresting part of the whole commentary, since Alyngton is faithful\nto Aristotle\u2019s text and doctrine, and sometimes even offers\nrather unproblematic analyses and elucidations. The main general topic\nhe deals with is the internal structure of the category.\n\nIn the first lines of the eighth chapter of the Categories\n(8a25\u201326) Aristotle observes that quality is among those things\nthat are spoken of in a number of ways\u2014an affirmation which\nseems to imply that quality is not a highest genus, as, according to\nAristotle himself, what is spoken of in a number of ways always\ngathers in several different natures. Furthermore, the Stagirite\nspeaks of four species of quality (habits and dispositions, natural\ncapacities and incapacities, affective qualities and affections,\nfigures and shapes), without explaining how they are related to one\nanother and to the highest genus of the category. No Aristotelian\ncommentator had ever thought that quality was spoken of in many ways\npurely equivocally. Therefore no Aristotelian commentator had ever\npresumed that the term \u2018quality\u2019 could have several\ndifferent (but connected) meanings. On the contrary, they unanimously\ntook for granted that it had a unique ratio, common to all\nthe items belonging to the category. They disagreed, however, about\nthe status and hierarchical order of the four species mentioned by\nAristotle. For example, Albert the Great held that quality at once and\ndirectly splits up into the four species, which would all be equally\nfar from the highest genus. Duns Scotus, Ockham, and Walter Burley\nmaintained that the so called \u2018species\u2019 of the quality\nwere not properly species (or intermediate genera), but modes of\nquality, since many singular qualities would belong to the first three\nspecies at the same time, as, unlike species, modes are not\nconstituted by opposite properties. Alyngton rejected both opinions.\nThe latter because it compromises the actual goal of a correct\ncategorial theory, and the former because it does not fit in with the\nstandard infracatagorial structure described by Porphyry in his\nIsagoge. Consequently, he inserts an intermediate level between the\nhighest genus of the category and the four species by claiming that\nquality is first of all divided into perceptible (sensibilis)\nand non-perceptible (insensibilis) qualities. Affective\nqualities and affections, figures and shapes stem from the former kind\nof quality, while habits and dispositions, natural capacities and\nincapacities derive from the latter. In fact, (1) figures and shapes\nare those perceptible qualities which inhere in substances because of\nthe mutual position of its quantitative parts, while affective\nqualities and affections inhere in substances because of the form\nitself of the substantial composite. (2) Natural capacities and\nincapacities are inborn non-perceptible qualities, while habits and\ndispositions are due to the activity, both physical and, if it is the\ncase, intellectual, of the substance in which they inhere (In\nCat., cap. de qualitate, fol. 130r).\n",
