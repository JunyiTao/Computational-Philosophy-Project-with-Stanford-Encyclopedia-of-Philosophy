Hobbes on the Value of Using Scientia in Natural Philosophy\n\nThe preceding sections have outlined Hobbes\u2019s views concerning\nwhy principles from geometry can be used within explanations\nin natural philosophy and his claim that before engaging in\nexperimentation one must have principles from geometry ready for use.\nStill one might wonder why Hobbes thought that this approach, inspired\nby \u201cmixed mathematics\u201d, would be more successful than the\nmethods of Boyle and his colleagues in the Royal Society. Indeed, what\nwas the aim of engaging in natural philosophy according to Hobbes?\nThis section describes Hobbes\u2019 view that the aim of natural\nphilosophy is to bring positive benefits to humans\u2019 quality of\nlife and then contrasts Hobbes\u2019s view on the usefulness and\nlimitations of \u201cprudence\u201d with the usefulness of natural\nphilosophy that employs scientia. \n\nAs mentioned already, Hobbes is well known for holding that all ideas\nin the mind are either from sense or derived from those that are\n(Leviathan I; LEV 22). Hobbes also linked\n\u201ctrains\u201d of ideas in the mind to sense by asserting that\njust as \u201cwe have no Imagination, whereof we have not formerly\nhad Sense, in whole, or in parts; so we have no Transition from one\nImagination to another, whereof we never had the like before in our\nSense\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 38). Hobbes divided these\ntrains of ideas into those that are guided and those that are\nunguided. Unguided trains explain what happens when the human mind\nwanders from idea to idea, such as when daydreaming. Hobbes described\nthese unguided trains as the \u201cwild ranging of the mind\u201d,\nand he noted that some might think that the connecting points in such\ntrains are by chance even if they are not. He compared such unguided\ntrains to a dialogue between conversants that began on one topic (the\npresent civil war) but over time seemed to drift to other topics by\nchance (concluding with a question about the price of a Roman penny).\nAlthough the connecting points between these topics of conversation\n(and the trains of ideas they signify in each conversant\u2019s mind)\nmay not be immediately obvious, Hobbes suggested that there was a\ncoherence to each transition. Hobbes traced this coherence in the\nexample he provided as follows:\n\n\u2026 the Thought of the warre, introduced the Thought of the\ndelivering up the King to his Enemies; The Thought of that, brought in\nthe Thought of the delivering up of Christ; and that again the Thought\nof the 30 pence, which was the price of that treason: and thence\neasily followed that malicious question; and all this in a moment of\ntime; for Thought is quick. (Leviathan III; LEV 40).\n\n\nHobbes intended the comparison between this example of a conversation\nand the way that unguided trains of ideas move from idea to idea to\nhave a general output: no matter how seemingly disconnected the links\nof any train of ideas may seem, there is always a coherent\nexplanation, whether it is obvious or not, that would explain them.\n\n\nIn contrast to the seemingly disconnected wanderings of the mind that\noccur with unguided trains, Hobbes saw guided trains of ideas as\ntransitions from idea to idea that were investigated by the mind with\nsome end or goal in view. Say that someone desired to eat a delicious\ndish that incorporated a particular type of meat and certain spices\nand herbs. If they desired to bring about that result, they would\nsearch through the trains of ideas in their mind, received from past\nsense experiences, until they found trains that terminated in that\ngoal. When they found a train that had the end result that they were\nseeking, they would trace back, idea by idea, until they found a\n\u201cbeginning\u201d that was within their current ability to\nproduce (Leviathan III; LEV 40). Continuing the example of a\ndesired dish, say that the individual found that a prior train of\nideas that termined with the desired end began with harvesting a\nparticular herb at a particular time of year. They would attempt to\nbring that \u201cbeginning\u201d about and, if successful, would\nmove on to the next idea in the train. There are no guarantees that\nthis would work, since the links in the train may be merely\nprobablistically connected to one another. Hobbes held that humans and\nnon-human animals shared this form of reasoning, which he identified\nas a type of causal inquiry: \u201c\u2026when of an effect\nimagined, wee seek the causes, or means to produce it\u201d\n(Leviathan III; LEV 40). Given the limitations mentioned\nalready related to knowing the causes of natural phenomena, Hobbes\ncould only have meant that possible causes can be identified\nby this process.\n\nHobbes connects prudence with an ability to engage in this type of\nreasoning on a broader scale. Individuals who have acquired much\nexperience, and thus have a large stock of trains of ideas at their\ndisposal, can make predictions about future events that may occur. For\nexample, on the basis of cooking hundreds of dishes with hundreds of\ningredients, a prudent individual could look at a given list of\ningredients and predict whether the outcome will likely be delicious\nor not. Hobbes thought that the more experience such an individual\nhad, the better the prediction would be: \u201c\u2026by how much\none man has more experiences of things past, than another; by so much\nalso he is more Prudent\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 42).\nPrudence is valuable for the human knower, but no matter how useful\nprudence may be, Hobbes thought that it could never arise above being\nbased upon mere associational connections between ideas. Instances of\nA have always been followed by B, so the prudent\nperson would reason, thus the A that has presently occurred\nwill likely be followed by B. Hobbes thought that this type\nof prediction by means of associations amounted to a mere presumption\nof what the future would look like (Leviathan III; LEV 44).\nIn other words, this inference required \u201csupposing like events\nwill follow like actions\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 42), but\nthat supposition might prove false and the inference would fail.\nFurthermore, any difference between prior antecedents and a current\ninitial condition could result in a failure on the part of the prudent\nindividual to predict successfully, as Hobbes noted:\n\u201c\u2026the omission of every little circumstance altering the\neffect, frustrateth the expectation of the most Prudent\u201d\n(Leviathan XLVI; LEV 1052). While useful in many everyday\nsituations, Hobbes thought that prudence showed its limitations when a\nknower encountered a novel situation.\n\nIf predictions made upon the basis of associations among ideas were\nthe extent of human knowledge of natural phenomena, it would seem that\nHobbes should have wholeheartedly endorsed the approach of the\nexperimental philosophy championed by Boyle and others. What are\nBoylean experiments if not repeated experiences in which one tries to\ncontrol for potential confounding variables, at least according to how\nHobbes saw them (Boyle would not agree with this\ncharacterization; see the section on\n Philosophy of Experiment in the entry on Boyle)?\n Hobbes saw experienced-based prudence as useful, but he denied that\nit counted as true knowledge of the future, which he held was\navailable only to the one by whose \u201cwill\u201d an event happens\n(Leviathan III; LEV 44). Hobbes\u2019s solution for moving\nbeyond mere associations required knowers to play an active role by\ncreating artificial objects (like the objects of geometry). Such\nknowledge (scientia) was more useful for predictions because\nit provided power to its holders, as he noted in De Corpore\n1.6: \u201cknowledge is the for the sake of power [Scientia\npropter potentiam]\u201d (OL I.6).\n\nUnlike association-based predictions, which are limited by the extent\nto which the prior antecedents resemble a current scenario and rest on\na presumption that the future will resemble the past, knowing the\ncauses of some event because one brought it about by one\u2019s will\nallowed one to understand its true nature. Hobbes thought that this\n\u201cpower\u201d provided direct benefits that improved the quality\nof human living, such as the marking of \u201cmoments in time\u201d\nand \u201cmapping the face of the earth\u201d (OL I.6\u20137). Similarly,\nthe science of civil philosophy (discussed more in the next section)\ncould help prevent civil war and other calamities (OL I.8). Hobbes\nrecognized that many citizens may not see the value of\nscientia because they fail to understand it: \u201cFor\nScience is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such\nas in good measure have attayned it\u201d (Leviathan X; LEV\n134). Furthermore, he admitted that many citizens would confuse the\ncause of success in the \u201carts of publique use\u201d; although\nthe reason why such arts produce effective fortifications and other\n\u201cInstruments of War\u201d lies in their use of principles from\nthe science of geometry, many will think that the inventor of such\ninstruments is responsible and because of this \u201cthe Midwife [the\nartificer] pass[es] with the vulgar for the Mother\u201d when the\n\u201cmother\u201d is really mathematics (Leviathan X; LEV\n134).\n\nIf the solution to moving beyond association-based prudence was to use\ngeometrical principles within natural philosophy, why did Hobbes think\nthis? As mentioned already, in Six Lessons (1656) Hobbes\nclaimed that because \u201cof natural bodies we know not the\nconstruction but seek it from the effects\u201d we can know\n\u201conly of what [the causes] may be\u201d (EW VII.184). A claim\nlike this might make it seem like the natural philosopher simply\nguesses cause might be responsible for a given phenomenon,\nbut Hobbes held that not all possible causes are on equal epistemic\nfooting. Hobbes\u2019s method of natural philosophy that mixes\nmathematical principles (the \u2018why\u2019) with observations from\nexperience (the \u2018that\u2019) rejected what Hobbes thought of as\na merely passive approach to understanding nature. In contrast, in the\nLetter to the Reader of De Corpore Hobbes compares\nphilosophizing to God\u2019s act of the creation of the world:\n\n\nIf you are going to pay serious attention to philosophy, let your\nreason hover over the confused abyss of your thoughts and experiences.\nThe confused things must be shaken violently, distinguished, and\nordered, having been marked with their own names, that is, in method\n[Methodo] it must be according to the creation of things\nthemselves. (OL I. Letter to Reader)\n\n\nUnlike what Hobbes saw as the passive approach of conducting and\nobserving experiments, which would provide associations in the form of\ntrains of ideas and eventually prudence, Hobbes thought natural\nphilosophy should imitate God\u2019s activity. The only way for\nnatural philosophy to provide the benefits that Hobbes saw following\nfrom it was for it to combine observations with certain knowledge from\nscientia. The result was that explanations in natural\nphilosophy were epistemically between mere associational prudence and\nthe certainty of scientia. We could thus characterize\nexplanations in Hobbes\u2019 natural philosophy as having\nhypothetical certainty. The natural philosopher cannot know with\ncertainty that nature behaves as an explanation claims. However, given\nthat they borrow causal principles from geometry, they can know that\nif nature behaved as they suppose, then certain\nconsequences would follow of necessity.\n",
