Who is Harmed by It?\n\nEugenics had many things wrong with it (see\n section 1.2 above).\n In part it was based on a poor understanding of human genetics.\nBeyond that, though, it was also morally abhorrent. Eugenics was\ngrounded on biased ideas about what made lives worth living. And it\nput decision-making power over what lives were worth living into the\nhands of government bodies and institutions. Dozens of states in\nAmerica passed some form of sterilization law that targeted people\ndeemed undesirable, so that society wouldn\u2019t be burdened by\npeople with physical and intellectual disabilities (Largent 2011).\nStates also enacted anti-miscegenation laws to prevent interracial\nmarriages that could contribute to \u201crace suicide\u201d (Pascoe\n2009; entry:\n eugenics).\n\nArchitects of the pivot to medical genetics and genetic counseling\nprograms in the mid-twentieth century tried to curtail some of the\nabhorrent features of this history by shifting control over\nreproductive decisions from governments/institutions to\nindividuals/families (see\n section 1.4 above).\n A technology like amniocentesis allowed a woman to decide whether or\nnot she wanted to carry a fetus that was likely to have Down syndrome\nto term or alternatively terminate the pregnancy. Carrier screening\nfor cystic fibrosis let prospective parents know what the chances were\nthat they could conceive a child with that condition. For families\nwith Huntington\u2019s disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis\nafter in vitro fertilization opened the door to only implanting\nembryos that did not carry the Huntington\u2019s disease allele.\nGenetic counselors saw their role as facilitating these\npatients\u2019 reproductive decision-making in a non-biased way.\nMedical geneticists hailed these genetic technologies, claiming they\nempowered families (and women in particular) with greater autonomous\ncontrol over their reproductive decisions (entry:\n pregnancy, birth, and medicine).\n\nCritics from disability studies, however, argued that medical\ngenetics\u2019 break from eugenics was not so clean-cut (Barnes 2016;\nParens and Asch 1999; Silvers 2016). When hospitals offered pregnant\nwomen the opportunity to screen for traits like Down syndrome and\ncystic fibrosis but not other traits like sex or eye-color, it sent a\nmessage to prospective parents that some traits\u2014like Down\nsyndrome and cystic fibrosis\u2014should be considered for\ntermination while other traits\u2014like sex and\neye-color\u2014should not (Parens and Asch 2000). Genetic counselors\naspired to offer genetic information in a non-directive fashion, but\ndisability-oriented critics argued that information shared with\nprospective parents about living with a disability was often skewed\nagainst disability (Asch 1989). The general message disability studies\nscholars highlighted was that medical genetics reinforced the idea\nthat disability was something to be avoided, not accommodated (Scully\n2008). This was seen as just the modern instantiation of the\nstraightforwardly eugenic idea that some lives are not worth living\n(Saxton 1997; Wendell 1996). What\u2019s more, the critics pointed\nout that standardizing these genetic technologies in the healthcare\nsystem actually put pressure on prospective parents to use them, which\nmeant the reproductive decisions were not as autonomous as genetic\ndefenders proclaimed (entries:\n disability: health, well-being, and personal relationships;\n feminist perspectives on disability).\n\nMedical genetics faced other criticisms as well. The standardization\nof genetic technologies contributed to the medicalization of\nconception, pregnancy, and birth; this altered the relationship\nbetween expecting parents and fetuses because a pregnancy became\nthought of as \u201ctentative\u201d until screening was complete,\nand it also impacted the way expecting parents prepared for and\ncommunicated about a pregnancy (Duden 1993). Racial health disparity\nscholars also criticized biomedical research investment in medical\ngenetics because it pulled resources away from known causes of health\ndisparities in the environment that had a bigger impact on the problem\n(Roberts 2011). In some cases, the concerns about medicalization and\nthe concerns about racial health disparities converged; for example,\nDorothy Roberts warned that it takes social and economic resources to\naccess the sorts of genetic technologies that hospitals offer (at\nleast in the United States), and so medical genetics only exacerbated\nhealth disparities (Roberts 2009; entries:\n feminist bioethics;\n the human genome project). Concerns about privacy have also expanded rapidly as\ngenomic information about people is increasingly in the hands of\nhospitals and private companies\n (entries: privacy and medicine;\n privacy and information technology).\n",
