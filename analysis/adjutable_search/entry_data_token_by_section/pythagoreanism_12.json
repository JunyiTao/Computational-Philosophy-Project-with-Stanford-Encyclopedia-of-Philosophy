    "main_text": "Other Pythagoreans of the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth Centuries || Plato and Pythagoreanism\n3.7 Plato and Pythagoreanism\n\nThere is currently a very wide range of opinions about the\nrelationship of Plato to Pythagoreanism. Many scholars both ancient\nand modern have thought that Plato was very closely tied to\nPythagoreanism. In the biography of Pythagoras read by Photius in the\n9th century CE (Bibl. 249) Plato is presented as a member of\nthe Pythagorean school. He is the pupil of Archytas and the ninth\nsuccessor to Pythagoras himself. If this were true then Plato would\ncertainly be the most illustrious early Pythagorean after Pythagoras\nhimself. Some modern scholars, while not going this far, have seen the\nconnections between Plato and the Pythagoreans to be very close\nindeed. Thus, A. E. Taylor in his great commentary on the\nTimaeus says that his main thesis is that \u201cthe teaching\nof Timaeus [in Plato\u2019s Timaeus] can be shown to be in\ndetail exactly what we should expect from an fifth-century Italian\nPythagorean\u201d (1928, 11). Guthrie in his famous history of\nancient philosophy commented that Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy\nwere so close that it is difficult to separate them (1975, 35).\nRecently it has been argued that Plato was so steeped in\nPythagoreanism that he structured his dialogues by counting numbers of\nlines and placing important passages at points in the dialogue that\ncorrespond to important ratios in Pythagorean harmonic theory\n(Kennedy, 2010 and 2011). Thus, the vision of the form of beauty\nappears 3/4 of the way through the Symposium by line count\nand the ratio 3 : 4 corresponds to the central musical interval of the\nfourth. There are, however, serious questions about the methodology\nused (Gregory 2012) and it is a serious problem both that no one in\nthe ancient world reports that Plato used such a practice and that the\nmiddle of the dialogue, which corresponds to the most concordant\nmusical interval, the octave (2:1), does not usually contain the most\nphilosophically important content. Another approach sees Plato as\nengaged with and heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideas in passages\nwhere the Pythagoreans are not specifically mentioned in dialogues\nsuch as the Cratylus (401b11-d7) and Phaedo\n(101b10\u2013104c9) (Horky 2013). The problem is that in contrast to\nthe Philebus, where the connection to Philolaus is clear (see\nbelow), the connections to the Pythagoreans in these passages are too\nindirect or general (e.g., the concepts odd and even and the number 3\nin the Phaedo passage are not unique to the Pythagoreans) to\nbe very convincing and partly depend on the doubtful assumption that\nEpicharmus was a Pythagorean (see section 3.4 above). The central text\nfor many of those who see Plato as closely tied to Pythagoreanism is\nAristotle\u2019s comment in Metaphysics 1.6 that Plato\n\u201cfollowed these men (i.e. the Pythagoreans according to these\nscholars) in most respects\u201d (987a29\u201331). In contrast to\nthese attempts to connect Plato closely to Pythagoreanism, most recent\nPlatonic scholars seem to think Pythagoreanism of little importance\nfor Plato. Thus two prominent handbooks to Plato\u2019s thought\n(Kraut 1992; Benson 2006) and another book of essays devoted\nspecifically to the Timaeus, (Mohr and Sattler 2010) hardly\nmention the Pythagoreans at all. \n\nIn recent studies of the topic that lie somewhere between these\nextremes, one approach is to argue that there is clear Pythagorean\ninfluence on Plato but that its scope is much more limited than often\nassumed (Huffman 2013). Plato explicitly mentions Pythagoras and the\nPythagoreans only one time each in the dialogues and this provides\nprima facie evidence that Pythagorean influence was not\nextensive. Moreover, at Metaphysics 987a29\u201331 the\n\u201cthese men\u201d that Aristole says Plato follows in most\nrespects may not be the Pythagoreans but the Presocratics in general.\nAristotle\u2019s presentation as a whole mainly attests to\nPythagorean influence only on Plato\u2019s late theory of principles.\nIt is often assumed that Plato owes his mathematical conception of the\ncosmos and his belief in the immortality and transmigration of the\nsoul to Pythagoreanism (Kahn 2001, 3\u20134). However, the role of\nPythagoreanism in Greek mathematics has been overstated and while\nPlato had contacts with mathematicians who were Pythagoreans like\nArchytas, the most prominent mathematicians in the dialogues,\nTheodorus and Theaetetus, are not Pythagoreans. It is thus a serious\nmistake to assume that any mention of mathematics in Plato suggests\nPythagorean influence. The same is true of the immortality and\ntransmigration of the soul in Plato, which are often assumed to be\nderived from Pythagoreanism. Some have also thought that Platonic\nmyths and especially the myth at the end of the Phaedo draw\nheavily on Pythagoreanism (Kingsley 1995, 79\u2013171). However, most\nof the contexts in which Plato mentions the immortality of the soul\nincluding the Platonic myths, suggest that he is thinking of mystery\ncults and the Orphics rather than the Pythagoreans (Huffman 2013,\n243\u2013254). On the other hand, in the Philebus (16c-17a)\nPlato gives clear acknowledgement of the debt he owes to men before\nhis time who posit limit and unlimited as basic principles. The\nfragments of Philolaus and Aristotle\u2019s reports on Pythagoreanism\nmake clear that this is a reference to Philolaus and the Pythagoreans.\nThe principles of limit and unlimited are clearly connected to\nPlato\u2019s one and indefinite dyad and it is precisely these\nprinciples of Plato that Aristotle connects most closely to\nPythagoreanism (Metaph. 987b25\u201332). Thus Plato\u2019s\nevidence coheres with Aristotle\u2019s to suggest that Pythagoreanism\nexerted considerable influence on Plato\u2019s late theory of\nprinciples. It is also true that specific aspects of Plato\u2019s\nmathematical view of the world are owed to the Pythagoreans, e.g., the\nworld soul in the Timaeus is constructed according to the\ndiatonic scale that is prominent in Philolaus (Fr. 6a). However, most\nof the Timaeus is not derived from Pythagoreanism and some of\nit in fact conflicits with Pythagoreanism (e.g., Archytas famously\nargued that the universe was unlimited while Plato\u2019s in\nlimited). The same is true for Plato as a whole. Isolated ideas such\nas the one and the dyad and the structure of the world soul show heavy\nPythagorean influence, but there is no evidence that Pythagoreanism\nplayed a central role in the development of the core of Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy (e.g., the theory of forms).\n\nA second approach is to argue that, while it is true that not all\nmentions of mathematics or all mentions of the transmigration of the\nsoul derive from Pythagoreanism, nonetheless a central system of value\nthat appears early in Plato\u2019s work and persists to the end is\nderived from Pythagoreanism (Palmer 2014). Already in the\nGorgias Plato argues that principles of order and correctness\nwhich are found in the cosmos and explain its goodness also govern\nhuman relations. Socrates here puts forth a much more definite\nconception of the good than in earlier dialogues. His complaint that\nCallicles pays no attention to the role played by orderliness and\nself-control and neglects geometrical equality (507e6\u2013508a8)\nmirrors the emphasis on organization and calculation in contemporary\nPythagorean texts such as Archytas Fr. 3 and Aristoxenus\u2019\nPythagorean Precepts Fr. 35. It thus appears that\n\u201cSocrates\u2019\u201d new insight into the good in\nGorgias derives from Plato\u2019s contact with the\nPythagoreans after the death of the historical Socrates. Plato never\nabandons this Pythagorean conception of value and it can be traced\nthrough the Phaedo and Republic to late dialogues\nsuch as the Timaeus, where the cosmos is embued with\nprinciples of mathematical order, and Philebus, where the\nhighest value is assigned to measure (66a). The question is whether\nthis emphasis on measure and order is uniquely Pythagorean in\norigin.\n",
