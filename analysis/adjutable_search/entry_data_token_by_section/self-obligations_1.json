    "main_text": "The Paradox of Self-Release\n2. The Paradox of Self-Release\n\nWhat\u2019s so weird about obligations to oneself?\n\nOne thing to note \u2013 not quite our topic, but important to clear\nup \u2013 is that many moral wrongs can be done only to other people.\nYou cannot steal your own lunch money, deceive yourself with lying\npromises, or bop yourself on the head against your own will. Who could\nbe duped by a promise they know to be false? (See Hill, Jr. 1991,\n144.) How can one \u201csteal\u201d what one already owns? (See\nHaase 2014, 365.) How can one will things against one\u2019s own\nwill?\n\nThis familiar fact \u2013 that some wrongs can be done to others but\nnot to ourselves \u2013 is called the asymmetry of possibilities\n(Mu\u00f1oz and Baron-Schmitt 2022 [Other Internet Resources]).\nThis asymmetry constrains the scope of self-wronging; some naughty\ninteractions are impossible in the one-person case. But this does not\nrule out all possible obligations to oneself. There are still\nplenty of problematic things one can do to oneself: bodily harm,\nproperty damage, and so on. Could we wrong ourselves by doing such\nthings, or is there something fishy about the very idea of an\nobligation to oneself?\n\nNow the real paradox. The tension arises from the dual nature of\nobligations: they are supposed to be both binding and waivable. Your\nobligations \u201cbind\u201d you in the sense that you have to\ncomply, other things equal, or else you wrong the person to whom you\nare obliged. But this person can, if they like, waive the obligation,\nreleasing you from your duty. This duality is perfectly intelligible\nin the two-person case. If you owe your friend $5 for a fancy coffee,\nyou are bound to pay \u2013 you cannot simply opt out, as you might\nopt out of a mailing list or a volunteer trip. And if your friend\nwants to unbind you, they can do so unmysteriously, simply by saying\n\u201cMy treat.\u201d\n\nWhat if you owe something to yourself? Then the \u201cbinding\u201d\nseems to vanish. Since you can willy-nilly waive any obligation owed\nto you, you can willy-nilly waive any obligation to yourself. Any such\nobligation is therefore purely optional \u2013 which sounds\nincoherent, like an obligatory hobby or a mercenary passion\nproject.\n\nThe modern version of the paradox is due to Marcus Singer (1959, 203),\nwho frames it as an argument with three premises:\n\nIf A has a duty to B, then B has a\nright against A.\nIf B has a right against A, he [or she] can give\nit up and release A from the obligation.\nNo one can release himself [or herself] from an obligation.\n\n\nTogether, these ensure that one cannot have duties to oneself.\n(\u201cDuties\u201d are just \u201cobligations\u201d with fewer\nsyllables.) It\u2019s a punchy argument. Duties entail rights; rights\nentail powers of release; but one cannot release oneself from a duty.\nThe conclusion, for Singer, is that one cannot have a duty to oneself;\nthe very idea of such a duty is \u201cself-contradictory\u201d\n(1958, 203).\n\nSinger\u2019s spin on the paradox is clear and forceful. It also\ncrucially involves the concept of a right, which is used to link\nduties to the power of release. But otherwise, the puzzle merely\nechoes several historical sources, which Singer does not cite or\nengage with (see Cholbi 2015). For example, here is Immanuel Kant.\n\nIf the I that imposes obligation is taken in the same sense\nas the I that is put under obligation, a duty to oneself is a\nself-contradictory concept. \u2026 [O]ne imposing obligation\n(auctor obligationis) could always release the one put under\nobligation (subjectum obligationis) from the obligation\n(terminus obligationis), so that (if both are one and the\nsame subject) he would not be bound at all to a duty he lays upon\nhimself. This involves a contradiction. (Metaphysics of\nMorals [MM]\n 6:417)[2]\n\n\nNotice the same emphasis on \u201cself-contradiction.\u201d And here\nis Thomas Hobbes, discussing legal rather than moral obligations:\n\nThe sovereign of a commonwealth, be it an assembly, or one man, is not\nsubject to the civil laws. For having power to make, and repeal laws,\nhe may, when he pleaseth, free himself from that subjection by\nrepealing those laws that trouble him and making of new; and\nconsequently he was free before. For he is free, that can be free when\nhe will; nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself,\nbecause he that can bind can release; and therefore, he that is bound\nto himself only is not bound. (1651 [1994, 174])\n\n\n\u201cHe is free, that can be free when he will\u201d is just\nanother way of saying that one cannot release oneself from a genuine\nobligation. When self-release is an option, one is never really\n bound.[3]\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\nWe have three options. The first is to follow the argument where it\nleads \u2013 namely, to Singer\u2019s nihilism, on which there is no\nsuch thing as a duty to self. The next option, which is the most\npopular among ethicists, is to defend unwaivable duties to oneself.\nFinally, some argue that self-release is not as incoherent as it\nsounds, and that we really do have waivable duties to, and maybe even\nrights against, ourselves.\n\nThe choice between these three options is a crossroads in moral\nphilosophy; in effect, we are choosing the place of the self within\nmoral theory. Singer says there is no place for the self in morality.\nThe Kantians \u2013 the chief defenders of unwaivable duties to self\n\u2013 are more likely to place the self at the privileged center.\nAnd those who believe in self-release see the self as just one moral\nperson among others, denying or downplay the specialness of\none\u2019s relation to oneself.\n\nOn what grounds have philosophers chosen one road over the others?\nWhere have their choices led them?\n",
