    "main_text": "\n\nElisabeth, Princess Palatine of Bohemia (1618\u20131680) is most\nwell-known for her extended correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes,\nand indeed these letters constitute what we currently know of her\nextant philosophical writings. In that correspondence, Elisabeth\npresses Descartes on the relation between the two really distinct\nsubstances of mind and body, and in particular the possibility of\ntheir causal interaction and the nature of their union. They also\ncorrespond on Descartes\u2019s physics, on the passions and their\nregulation, on the nature of virtue and the greatest good, on the\nnature of human freedom of the will and its compatibility with divine\ncausal determination, and on political philosophy. Descartes dedicated\nhis Principles of Philosophy to Elisabeth, and wrote his\nPassions of the Soul at her request. While there is much to\nbe learned about Descartes\u2019s philosophical views by reading this\nexchange, this entry is not focused on its relevance\nfor understanding Descartes, but rather to summarize Elisabeth\u2019s\nown philosophical views. We are now also aware of additional\ncorrespondence with scientists of the period, as well as extensive\nfamily correspondence. Elisabeth seems to have been involved in\nnegotiations around the Treaty of Westphalia and in efforts to restore\nthe English monarchy after the English civil war. As Abbess of Herford\n(Germany) convent, she managed the rebuilding of that war-impacted\ncommunity and also provided refuge to marginalized Protestant\nreligious sects, including Labadists and Quakers.\n",
