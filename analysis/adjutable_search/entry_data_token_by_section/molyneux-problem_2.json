    "main_text": "The First Experimental Data\n3. The First Experimental Data\n\nDiscussion concerning Molyneux\u2019s problem took a new turn once\nthe English surgeon and anatomist William Cheselden (1688\u20131752)\npublished an account of what a congenitally blind person had seen\nafter his cataracts had been removed (1728). The publication led\nphilosophers to regard the Molyneux problem no longer as a simple\nthought-experiment, but as a question which could be answered by\nexperimentation.\n\nIn his account, Cheselden noted that when the boy\u2014who recently\nhas been identified as Daniel Dolins\u2014was first able to see, he\ndid not know the shape of a thing and could not recognize one thing\nfrom another, regardless of how different in shape or magnitude they\n were.[2]\n Some philosophers thought that Cheselden\u2019s observations were\nunequivocal and that they confirmed the hypothesis that a blind man\nrestored to sight would not be able to distinguish objects and would\nhave to learn to see. Most of these philosophers, we might mention\nVoltaire, Camper and the elder Condillac as examples, were adherents\nof Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision, which had predicted a similar\noutcome.\n\nOthers, however, such as La Mettrie and Diderot, regarded\nCheselden\u2019s account as wholly ambiguous in its implications.\nThey pointed out that it was possible that the boy had been unable to\nmake valid perceptual judgments because his eyes had not been\nfunctioning properly. They suggested that this could have been due to\nthe fact that his eyes had not been used for a long time, or to their\nnot having had enough time to recover from the operation. They pointed\nout that Cheselden had, perhaps, asked the boy leading questions. Some\nphilosophers also believed that the results of the inquiry depended on\nthe intelligence of the patient.\n\nThose who criticised the significance of Cheselden\u2019s account in\nthis way (most of them were French philosophes) made\nproposals as to how to avoid the problems mentioned. They suggested\nthat one should prepare the patient carefully for the operation and\nfor the interrogation, that one should allow his eyes time to recover\nfrom the operation and that one should give him the opportunity to\nexercise his eyes in darkness. What is more, one should avoid asking\nleading questions.\n\nSome philosophers were even more radically critical of operations like\nthat performed by Cheselden. M\u00e9rian, for example, noticed that\nCheselden\u2019s observations, like all observations of blind people\nwhose cataracts have been extracted, present difficulties because\ncataracts do not cause complete blindness and complete blindness\ncannot be cured. It could not be concluded from this that\nMolyneux\u2019s problem could not be solved experimentally, however,\nfor it could be maintained that patients operated upon for cataracts\nare directly relevant to the solution of it. They are unable to\nperceive form before they are operated upon, and the essential issue\nat stake when posing Molyneux\u2019s problem is the ability to\ndistinguish and name forms. This is a point of view which was taken by\nmany philosophers.\n\n",
