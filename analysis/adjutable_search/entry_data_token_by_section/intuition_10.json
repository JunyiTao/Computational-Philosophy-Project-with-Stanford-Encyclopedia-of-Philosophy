    "main_text": "Challenges and Defenses || The Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n3.2 The Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n\nSome skeptics regarding intuition argue that intuition is\nepistemically illegitimate because it cannot be independently\ncalibrated. In Cummins\u2019 forceful presentation of the argument,\nthis independent calibration requirement is used to justify the\nconclusion that we should \u201cdismiss philosophical intuition as\nepistemologically valueless\u201d (1998: 125).\n\nLet us state the argument as follows:\n\n\nThe Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n\n[P1] One is justified\nin believing the contents of a putative source of evidence only if one\nhas independent justification for the belief that the putative source\nis reliable.\n[P2] We lack\nindependent justification for the belief that intuitions are\nreliable.\n[C]  We are not\njustified in believing the contents of intuitions.\n\n\n\nThough it has substantial plausibility in connection with various\nderived epistemic sources such as scientific instruments, it is clear\nthat [P1] runs afoul of the local skepticism constraint. It amounts to\na demand which is in principle unsatisfiable. If, as [P1]\nimplies, intuition must be calibrated by some other source, X,\nthen, by [P1], X must itself be calibrated by yet another\nsource of evidence, Y, which must itself be calibrated and so\non. Some hold, in virtue of this fact, that it is impossible to arrive\nat justified belief and others that it is, in suitable circumstances,\npossible to do so. If the former is true, then [P1] runs afoul of the\nlocal skepticism constraint. If, instead, the latter is true, then\n[P1] is false. Additionally, it seems clear that an argument for [P1]\nwill require evidential reliance on epistemic intuitions and so\ncontravene the non-self-undermining requirement.\n\nWhat of [P2]? Setting aside non-reductive accounts of testimony,\nindependent calibrations look unlikely to succeed for the full range\nof philosophically relevant intuitions, at least given the more\nconstrained accounts of intuition above. The primary reason is the\nlack of overlap between the contents of intuitions and those beliefs\njustified by suitably independent sources. One doesn\u2019t, it\nseems, use one\u2019s senses to discern if some hypothetical case is\na case of knowledge or right action or a case in which the\nhypothetical entity is conscious or in which two temporally distinct\npersons are the same person. As well, while perception may indicate\nthe truth of some proposition and hence its possibility, it seems\nincapable of itself demonstrating the possibility of non-actual truths\nor the necessity of any proposition.\n",
