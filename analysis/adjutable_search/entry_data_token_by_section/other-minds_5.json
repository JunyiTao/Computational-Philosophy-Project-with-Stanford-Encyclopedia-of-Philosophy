    "main_text": "The Conceptual Problem of Other Minds\n2. The Conceptual Problem of Other Minds\n\nThomas Nagel once wrote:\n\n\nThe interesting problem of other minds is not the epistemological\nproblem\u2026. It is the conceptual problem, how I can\nunderstand the attribution of mental states to others. (1986:\n19\u201320)\n\n\nBilgrami agrees (1992). Some philosophers go further than Nagel and\ninsist that the conceptual is the fundamental problem; others see\nlittle in it (Hyslop 1995). How one understands this problem is a\nmatter of some contention (Gomes 2011). What all agree is that the\nproblem is associated with the work of Wittgenstein, and in particular\nsection 302 from the Philosophical Investigations:\n\n\nIf one has to imagine someone else\u2019s pain on the model of\none\u2019s own, this is none too easy a thing to do: for I have to\nimagine pain which I do not feel on the model of pain which I\ndo feel. That is, what I have to do is not simply to make a\ntransition in imagination from one place of pain to another. As, from\nthe pain in the hand to pain in the arm. For I am not to imagine that\nI feel pain in some region of his body\u2026.\n\n\nMalcolm understands 302 as providing an \u201cexternal attack\u201d\non the possibility of a private language (contrast the argument of\n \u00a71.1).\n That is to say, 302 is designed to show the difficulty that one runs\ninto if one begins with the idea that one knows from one\u2019s own\ncase what it is to feel pain: one risks conceptual solipsism.\n [12]\n Colin McGinn has suggested that the problem raised in 302 can be\nthought of in the following way: if I learn through introspection what\nit is, say, to be in pain, then there is a \u201ca way of thinking\nabout my experiences which (a) only I have and (b) enters into my\nunderstanding of the concept in question\u201d (1984: 127). The way I\nlearn about the object of my thought here is as something that has a\n\u201cdistinctively first-person element\u201d from which it seems\nimpossible to prescind (ibid). This explains why I can make a\ntransition from the pain in my hand to the pain in my arm, but it is\n\u201cnone too easy a thing\u201d to make a transition from a pain\nthat I feel in my hand to a pain that you feel somewhere in your body\n(for a very different interpretation of the 302, see Kripke 1982,\nPostscript).\n\nSome associate the conceptual problem here with the problem of coming\nto have mental concepts that are completely general. Gareth Evans has\nproposed that to have a thought about an object to the effect that it\nis F (consider: Tom is angry) requires the exercise of the\nfollowing two capacities:\n\n\nOne being the capacity to think of x, which could be equally\nexercised in thoughts about x to the effect that it is\nG or H; and the other being a conception of what it\nis to be F, which could be equally exercised in thoughts\nabout other individuals, to the effect that they are F.\n(1982: 75)\n\n\nEvans labels this the \u201cgenerality constraint\u201d\n(Ibid, ftnt. 15), and it has been thought to raise a problem\nfor thoughts about mental states if one takes it that one comes to\nknow what a mental state is by inward reflection alone. The problem,\nreflected in 302, is how to understand the extension to others of a\nconcept acquired in this way.\n\nP.F. Strawson in effect acknowledges the generality constraint when he\nwrites:\n\n\nIt is a necessary condition of one\u2019s ascribing states of\nconsciousness, experiences, to oneself, in the way that one does, that\none should also ascribe them, or be prepared to ascribe them, to\nothers who are not oneself. (1959: 99)\n\n\nStrawson considers how it is that one ascribes mental states to others\nand concludes that one cannot do this if we insist on divorcing mental\nstates from the behaving body. Strawson claims that we must\nacknowledge what he calls the \u201cprimitiveness of the concept of a\nperson\u201d, the concept of\n\n\na type of entity such that both predicates ascribing states\nof consciousness and predicates ascribing corporeal\ncharacteristics \u2026 are equally applicable\u2026. (1959:\n101\u20132)\n\n\nWhile many will accept that the conceptual problem is the\nfirst problem we encounter in connection with others, others\ngo further and claim that once one addresses the conceptual problem\nthere is no room for the epistemological one. This is because our way\nof thinking and talking about mind will have application to others\nbuilt into it from the start. It has been pointed out that to say what\nis required for grasp of a concept is not yet to show that that\nconcept is\n instantiated.[13]\n It can be said in reply that it is a particular proposed solution to\nthis conceptual problem that may be thought to make the\nepistemological question otiose. As we can see with Strawson\u2019s\nproposal, the idea is that we break down the gap between mind and\nbehavior and understand what one experiences when one sees\nanother\u2019s behavior as itself requiring mental state attributions\nto the other. Some can only see in this proposal a retreat into\nbehaviorism. Others, however, insist that this is not the\ncase\u2014at least if behaviorism is understood as a reductionist\nthesis. It is not reductionist to hold that behavior is expressive of\nanother\u2019s mental life; genuinely expressive behavior is held to\nbe distinguishable from \u2018mere behavior\u2019 (cf. Austin\n1946).\n\nMcDowell claims to echo Strawson\u2019s work when he writes in this\nconnection that we must regain the concept of a human being\nfrom what he takes to be a \u201cphilosophically generated\u201d\nconcept of a human body (McDowell 1982: 469; cf. Cook 1969).\nSome take issue with McDowell over whether the latter is only a\nphilosophically generated concept (Wright 1998), but it is hard to\ndeny that the move from the former concept to the latter is deeply\nsignificant.\n",
