Atomist Natural Philosophy\n\n\nFor Gassendi, the great promise of the atomist hypothesis is the\nexplanatory power across diverse domains of material phenomena (and\nthe great test, where feasible, is the gathering of empirical evidence\non behalf of that hypothesis). Gassendi's advance here is to develop\natomist accounts that are mechanically viable, where none previously\nexisted\u2014whether because prior mechanical approaches were thought\ninapplicable or because no solutions as such approaches yielded were\nactually successful.\n\n\nIn what we today think of as chemistry and physics, Gassendi develops\na great range of applications for his atomist hypothesis. In his\noptics, the atomist theory of light provides a counter to Descartes's\nview of light as pressure. For Gassendi, light is a property carried\nby particular atoms (atomi lucificae) that are identical with\nheat atoms. These tend to travel at greater than average velocity\nbecause they generally have fewer obstacles in their paths than most\natoms (O I 422a-432b). Sound, too, is particulate, and travels as such\nparticles travel. In contrast to a typical sound-wave view, the\nsurrounding medium does not play an important role: Gassendi takes the\nvelocity of sound particles, like that of light particles, to be\ninvariant with respect to the air or wind in which they travel. In an\nexperiment he models after a similar one of Mersenne's, he judges the\nvelocity of sound to be 1,473 ft/sec [478 meters/sec] (his\ncalculations are off by 435 ft/sec [146.7 meters/sec]) and invariant\nto the pitch of the sound (O I 418a-419a).  Even planetary motion has\nan ultimately atomist explanation, as the underlying forces driving\nthe planets are magnetic forces borne by dedicated atoms (this is an\natomist modification of a view developed, though later abandoned, by\nKepler).\n\n\nGassendi's atomist accounts of chemical phenomena are equally\nambitious, suggesting among other things how vapors are created and\nmetals are soluble. Vapors are brought about by increases in the\ndistance between atoms in a liquid volume. Heat atoms remove some of\nthe atoms present in the volume, resulting in a greater percentage of\nvoid and the matter taking the form of vapors (O I 398b-399a). As\nconcerns solubility, we account for aqua regia dissolving\ngold, and aqua fortis dissolving silver, as a result of their\ncomplementary atomic structures: gold atoms fit the pores of aqua\nregia and silver atoms fit the pores of aqua fortis (O\nII 33b ff, 39a-b).\n\n\nIn the realm of biological phenomena, Gassendi offers greatly diverse\naccounts drawing on an atomist framework. His most significant\nproposal in this regard is an account of generation and inheritance in\nterms of a material \u2018soul\u2019 or animula bearing\nontogenetic information. In sexual reproduction, two sets of seminal\nmatter and corresponding animulae meet and jointly determine the\ndivision, differentiation, and development of matter in the new\norganism. The determination of inherited traits requires combining or\nchoosing among each parent's contributions, entailing competition and\ndominance among the animulae (O II 284b-285a). The animula is defined\nin terms of its constituent atoms, which must be uniform in order that\nanimulae may operate equivalently across different modes of\ngeneration, whether \u2018pre-organized\u2019 or\nspontaneous. Further, Gassendi offers his molecular model as a\nmaterial means of storing ontogenetic information received from the\nsouls of parent organisms (O II 170b-171a, 280b).\n\n\nRather more curious stories are found in his accounts of development,\nphysiology, and behavioral psychology. Thus, the root cause of\nincreased shellfish growth and marrow production during full moons is\nincreased humidity, stemming from the excitement of lunar moisture\ncorpuscles by sunlight. These corpuscles are then transported to the\nEarth by rays from the sun reflected off the moon (O I 450a-451a). He\naccounts for toxicological phenomena, such as the stunning capacity of\nelectric rays (torpedine), as emission of corpuscles with a\ndulling power (O I 454b-455a). Other poisons provoke strange behavior,\nsuch as those of the tarantula. These may work by producing activity\nin the victim sympathetic to the attacker's activity, a result of\nchemical alterations the poisons bring about in the victim's sensory\ncapacities and attunements (O I 456a). As concerns animal psychology,\nGassendi endorses Lucretius's suggestion (RN IV) that lions avoid\nroosters at dawn because the latter can inject harmful corpuscles into\nthe former's eyes (O I 453b-454a). Sheep avoid unfamiliar wolves\nbecause wolves emit corpuscles of an odor offensive to sheep (O I\n456a).\n\n\nAs concerns human psychology, Gassendi offers a materialist (hence\nultimately atomist) account of the passions as a function of the\nvegetative soul, including desire and fear, and motivating pleasure\nand pain (O II 474f, 495f); these are ultimately governed, however, by\nthe rational and immaterial soul. There are, broadly, any number of\ncognitive faculties and attributes that may be built out of or be\nproduced by atoms, Gassendi suggests, countering Lactantius's\ncomplaint that the \u2018senses, thought, memory, the mind, genius,\n[or] reason\u2019 cannot so be constructed. As with the passions,\nthough, there are limits.  A viable atomist story can be told of\nsensory phenomena and idea-formation though not reason and its allied\nphenomena (O I 282b).  Yet there is clearly some grey area, as memory\nin particular seems open to a purely materialist account. Memory loss\nresults from a physical change in the brain resulting from\nundernourishment; folds in brain matter preserve the physical\nembodiment of memory, but a deficiency in nutrition leads to the\ndeterioration of those folds (O II 406b-407b; a similar Cartesian view\nappears in the Treatise on Man (AT XI 177-178)).\n",
