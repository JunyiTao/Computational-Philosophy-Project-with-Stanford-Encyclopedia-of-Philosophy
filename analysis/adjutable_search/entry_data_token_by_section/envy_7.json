One of these is the propensity to\nenvy. One justification Rawls offers for this stipulation is that what\nprinciples of justice are chosen should not be affected by individual\ninclinations, which are mere accidents. This rationale is less\npersuasive if envious concerns are universal in human nature. Another\njustification is that parties in the original position should be\nconcerned with their absolute level of primary social goods, not with\ntheir standing relative to others as\n such.[26]\n He then proceeds in the second part of the argument for the\nprinciples of justice to consider whether, in fact, human propensities\nbeing what they are, the tendency to envy will undermine the\narrangements of a well-ordered society (in which case the principles\nof justice would have to be reconsidered). The \u2018Problem of\nEnvy\u2019 is the possibility that widespread envy might do just\nthis. The reason that Rawls takes this to be a live possibility is\nthat \u201cthe inequalities sanctioned by the difference principle\nmay be so great as to arouse envy to a socially dangerous\n extent.\u201d[27]\n\nThe primary way in which Rawls thinks envy could pose such a threat is\nif it comes to undermine the self-respect of those who are less well\noff. It might do this, he thinks, if the differences between the haves\nand the have-nots are so great that, under existing social conditions,\nthe differences cannot help but cause loss of self-esteem. \u201cFor\nthose suffering this hurt,\u201d he continues, \u201cenvious\nfeelings are not irrational; the satisfaction of their rancor would\nmake them better off.\u201d (534) He calls this \u201cexcusable\ngeneral envy,\u201d and offers two reasons for doubting that it will\nbe prevalent in a well-ordered society. First, he argues that the\nliberties and political status of equal citizens encourage\nself-respect even when one is less well off than others. Second, he\nsuggests that background institutions (including a competitive\neconomy) make it likely that excessive inequalities will not be the\nrule.\n\nRawls\u2019 discussion is in some tension with the received view of envy.\nHe supposes that \u201cthe main psychological root of our liability\nto envy is a lack of self-confidence in our own worth combined with a\nsense of impotence.\u201d This leads him to expect that envy will be\nmore severe the greater the differences between subjects and those\nthey\n envy.[28]\n However most observers of envy, from Aristotle on, have urged that it\nis most often felt toward those with whom the subject perceives\nhimself as in competition, so that typically very great disparities in\nwell-being are not envied. And there is some empirical evidence to\nsupport this\n claim.[29]\n This is usually explained by the hypothesis that the benchmarks\nagainst which people measure their comparative well-being are, in some\n(possibly metaphorical) sense, local. If true, this calls into\nquestion whether preventing excessive inequalities is likely to reduce\nthe frequency or intensity of envy. But it also suggests that the\nphenomenon of general, or class, envy toward which Rawls\u2019 discussion\nis directed may not pose a substantial threat to the well-ordered\nsociety.\n",
