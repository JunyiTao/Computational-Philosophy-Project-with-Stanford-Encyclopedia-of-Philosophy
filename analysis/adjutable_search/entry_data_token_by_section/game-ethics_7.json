    "main_text": "Game Theory and Contractarianism\n4. Game Theory and Contractarianism\n\nArguably the most systematic use of game theory in moral and political\nphilosophy has been in contractarian approaches to justifying moral or\npolitical orders. Philosophers have typically characterized the\nsocial contract as a set of rules for regulating the\ninteractions of members of a community. By providing a formal model of\ninteractive decision-making, game theory is clearly relevant to the\nanalysis of such contracts. What has been particularly distinctive of\ngame theoretic analysis of the social contract, though, is an emphasis\non bargaining problems. As we will discuss below, the Nash bargaining\nproblem provides a simple, yet flexible and conceptually powerful\nframework for identifying which of the rules that might comprise a\ncontract can be said to be mutually beneficial (or acceptable) to each\nmember of a community. In the main text of the two subsections that\nfollow we try to present a relatively non-technical overview of this\nframework. Where formal characterizations of concepts are important,\nor where discussion of technical issues is likely to be illuminating\nfor some readers, we\u2019ve included such discussion in notes that\nappear at the end of the respective subsections. For a more thorough\nanalysis of contractarian approaches to justifying moral and political\norders, including further discussion of some of these technical\nissues, see the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract.\n",
