    "main_text": "Disability as a systematic rationing consideration: ethical concerns || Resolving the dilemma: moving beyond CEA\n3.3 Resolving the dilemma: moving beyond CEA\n\nThe dilemma created by the cost-effectiveness strategy, or more\ngenerally a utilitarian approach, may be argued to reflect the\nperennial conflict in distributive justice between \u201cfair\nchances\u201d and \u201cbest outcomes\u201d. Although there are\ndiehard utilitarians like Stein, most philosophers are drawn to the\nview that we must in light of these problems find compromise positions\nin which cost efficiency is moderated by some countervailing principle\nof fairness. Although the debate is about how to construct a social\npolicy of health care allocation\u2014which potentially affects\neveryone, so that everyone\u2019s interests need to be taken into\naccount\u2014this does not mean that the three presumptions mentioned\nabove are rejected. No participant in this debate would argue that\ncosts do not matter, that effective use of resources is irrelevant, or\nthat health care outcomes are wholly subjective and incommensurable.\nInstead, we need to make allocation decision-making more complex by\ntaking account of egalitarian \u201cside constraints\u201d that\nmight modify our CEA results.\n\nThus some philosophers have argued that the debate needs to be infused\nwith the basic egalitarian principle of equal concern and respect, a\nprinciple that may from time to time trump CEA considerations.\nSometimes, that is, \u201cbest outcomes\u201d needs to be moderated\nby \u201cfair chances\u201d. Dan Brock, who was the first to raise\nthe question of how disability impacts on health care allocation,\nargued that the best way forward is to structure health resource\nallocation to secure, to the greatest extent, equality of opportunity\nfor all (Brock 1995). Relocating the center of gravity of health care\nallocation to equality of opportunity was extremely appealing since it\naccorded with the a prominent view about the nature of health, and the\nvalue of health care, most clearly articulated by Norman Daniels\n(1985, and further developed in Daniels 2008). Health, Daniels argued,\nhas a special moral significance for us because it facilitates and\nenhances our full range of opportunities in life, so ensuring that equality\nof health care is one of society\u2019s most effective means of\nensuring equality of opportunity across the board.\n\nYet it was not clear how a renewed emphasis on \u201cfair\nchances\u201d helps to resolve the dilemma that CEA purportedly\ncreates. Even if a purely \u201cbest outcome\u201d approach\ndisadvantages people with disabilities, focusing on \u201cfair\noutcomes\u201d would not mean that we ignored differences in costs\nand capacity to benefit created by disability. One might argue that,\nas abstracted individuals, everyone should have an equal opportunity\nto benefit from health care resources, ceteris paribus. Yet,\nas it is irrational to ignore issues of cost and benefit, it is clear\nthat disability is just the paradigm example of a consideration that\ndisrupts the ceteris paribus assumption. People with\ndisabilities cannot fairly be denied the opportunity to benefit from\nhealth care, but on rational and relevant grounds of cost and prospect\nof benefit, they can fairly be denied health care, at least on a case\nby case basis. Brock came to realize that the move to egalitarian\nequality of opportunity could not resolve the dilemma posed by the\nrelevance of disability in health care rationing. After nearly three\ndecades of work he acknowledged that the problem of seemingly\njustifiable disability discrimination \u201crepresents a deep and\nunresolved problem for resource prioritization\u201d (Brock 2002) and\n\u201cthere is much work still to be done\u201d (Brock 2009). \n\nFor his part, Daniels has argued that when it comes to health resource\ndecisions our fundamental intuitions are permanently at odds and\negalitarian theory cannot help. Our only solution is to ensure that\nour health resource allocation policy is formalized so that all\ndecisions are firmly grounded on fair deliberative processes, in which\nevery voice and argument is heard and decisions are made by a fair and\nneutral arbiter (Daniels, et al. 2000; Daniels 2008).\n\nSearching for an egalitarian allocation principle that might avoid the\ndilemma, some philosophers have gone back to the priority problem\nmentioned above and noted that, depending on the severity of the\ndisability, a person with disabilities may have a greater need for\nhealth resources than a non-disabled individual, or that the health\nresource may have a more profound impact on securing equality of\nopportunity for the disabled person. Making the case for allocation in\nterms of who is \u201cworst off\u201d reflects the version of\negalitarianism called prioritarianism (see Parfit 1997; Arneson 2000)\nin which the distribution of a resource is guided by the intuition\nthat the worst off have more to gain and should be given priority,\nnot, like in the utilitarian approach in terms of great welfare\nbenefit, but because of greater need.\n\nThe prioritarian, however, has two impressive hurdles to overcome: how\nto determine, in health terms, who is \u201cworse off\u201d, and\nsecondly a version of the indirect benefits problem: why should we\nrestrict our focus on health when health resources have knock-on\nbenefits that go far beyond the sphere of health, including becoming a\nproductive member of society. Both issues turn in part on whether\nhealth is an intrinsic or an instrumental good (or both). If purely\ninstrumental, then the value of a health improvement\u2014and so an\nestimate of how worse off a person would be without that\nimprovement\u2014can only be determined by looking at the resulting\nconsequences for the individual and society. Moving in this direction\na wide range of considerations\u2014social position, income level,\ninnate talents and good luck\u2014would be determinative, even though\nthey have very little to do with the health benefit itself. If health\nis only intrinsically valuable, then we would need a direct,\nunidimensional and comparative metric of health-related disadvantage.\nThis is a formidable challenge since, once again, it would require\nanswers to imponderable questions such as \u201cIs a person who is\nblind \u2018worse off\u201d than a person who is deaf?\u2019\n\nRecently, Greg Bognar, recalling a version of \u201cluck\negalitarianism\u201d (see Arneson 2000) has suggested another tactic\nthat might avoid this tangle (Bognar 2010, 2011). Trading on the\ndistinction between the value of a life and its moral worth, he has\nargued that we are uncomfortable with the quality of life measure, not\nbecause it is irrelevant to the capacity to benefit from a health\nresource, but because it tells us nothing about whether the individual\ndeserves or merits the scarce resource. He suggests that in general we\nshould ignore disability in the allocation of health resources.\nDisability is only relevant, he claims, when it diminishes the\ncapacity to benefit from the health resource and the individual is\nresponsible for the disability. Thus, while it would be unjust to deny\na person a hip and knee replacement just because he or she is blind\nbecause of bad luck, it would not seem to be unjust if the person was\nvoluntarily obese: being overweight contributed to the need for the\nreplacement surgery in the first place, and would in any event reduce\nthe benefit that the person would receive from the surgery. \n\nAlthough an intriguing theoretical take on the problem, Bognar\u2019s\nsolution, like all forms of luck egalitarianism, is fraught with a\nvery practical problem of distinguishing causal responsibility from\nmoral responsibility. We may feel confident blaming the excessive\ndrinker for the medical need of a liver transplant, but only if we are\nequally confident that drinking was a choice, rather than a\ngenetically predisposed behavior. And how far back in the causal\nhistory do we need to go to determine innocence or guilt? Most\ntraumatic spinal cord injuries are the result of risky behaviors, and\nthe soldier who voluntarily enlists surely understands the risks. Even\nassuming that these investigations into blameworthiness could\nconceivably be resolved, and resolved in a timely and inexpensive\nmanner, Bognar is not offering a feasible solution to healthcare\nallocation in practice since ignoring blameworthy disability when\nallocating resources is not only unfair, but impractical since\ndisabilities need to be taken into account in order to ensure that\ntreatments and other medical interventions are as appropriate and\nbeneficial for people with disabilities as for those without.\n",
