    "main_text": "Species Pluralism\n3. Species Pluralism\n\nBiologists offer various definitions of the term \u2018species\u2019\n(Claridge, Dawah, and Wilson 1997). Biologists call these different\ndefinitions \u2018species concepts.\u2019 Consider three of these\nconcepts. The Biological Species Concept defines a species as a group\nof organisms that can successfully interbreed and produce fertile\noffspring. The Phylogenetic Species Concept (which has multiple\nversions) defines a species as a group of organisms bound by a unique\nancestry. The Ecological Species Concept defines a species as a group\nof organisms that share a distinct ecological niche. These species\nconcepts are just three among over a dozen prominent species concepts\nin the biological literature.\n\nWhat are we to make of this variety of species concepts? Monists\nbelieve that an aim of biological taxonomy is to identify the single\ncorrect species concept. Perhaps that concept is among the species\nconcepts currently proposed and we need to determine which concept is\nthe right one. Or perhaps we have not yet found the correct species\nconcept and we need to wait for further progress in biology.\nPluralists take a different stance. They do not believe that there is\na single correct species concept. Biology, they argue, contains a\nnumber of legitimate species concepts. Pluralists believe that the\nmonist\u2019s goal of a single correct species concept should be\nabandoned.\n",
