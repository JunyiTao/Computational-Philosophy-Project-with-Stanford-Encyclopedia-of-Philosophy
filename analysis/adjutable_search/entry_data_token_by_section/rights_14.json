    "main_text": "Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights || Contractual and Justificatory Rights\n6.3 Contractual and Justificatory Rights\n\nA third approach to the justification of rights might be called\n\u201ccontractual.\u201d Here rights are characterized neither as\nnaturally fitting for independent beings nor as tools to promote the\nbest state of affairs. Rather, rights define principles that would be\nchosen by properly situated and motivated agents agreeing to the basic\nterms of their relations (e.g., principles chosen in Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position, or principles within Scanlon\u2019s contractualism\nthat no one could reasonably reject). The fact that these principles\nwould be agreed to under the specified conditions is their\njustification.\n\nThe rights that define fundamental principles within these theories\nare phrased in terms of what the theories\u2019 agents have strong\nreason to want. So, for example, Rawls states that the role of a\ncitizen\u2019s right of personal property \u201cis to allow a\nsufficient material basis for a sense of personal independence and\nself-respect, both of which are essential for the development and\nexercise of the two moral powers\u201d (Rawls 1993, 298). And Scanlon\nsays that reasonable individuals \u201chave reason to insist \u2026 on\nbasic rights, which give them important forms of protection and\ncontrol over their own lives\u201d (Scanlon 2003, 4).\n\nForst (2012, 2014, 2016) combines critical and contractualist theory\ninto a sophisticated account of rights. Beginning with a status-based\nfundamental right to justification, he shows how suitably idealized\ndemands for justification from individuals subordinated within real\nrelations of power can ground specific rights to relief from and\nredress for actual injustices. Forst\u2019s framework shows the\nenduring theoretical appeal and practical potential of the Kantian\ntradition of understanding rights.\n",
