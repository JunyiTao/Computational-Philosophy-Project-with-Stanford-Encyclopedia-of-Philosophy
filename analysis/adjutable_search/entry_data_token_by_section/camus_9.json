    "main_text": "Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel || Absurdity, Rebellion, and Murder\n4.1 Absurdity, Rebellion, and Murder\n\nAt the beginning of The Rebel, Camus picks up where he left\noff in The Myth of Sisyphus. Writing as a philosopher again,\nhe returns to the terrain of argument by explaining what absurdist\nreasoning entails. Its \u201cfinal conclusion\u201d is \u201cthe\nrepudiation of suicide and the acceptance of the desperate encounter\nbetween human inquiry and the silence of the universe\u201d\n(R, 6). Since to conclude otherwise would negate its very\npremise, namely the existence of the questioner, absurdism must\nlogically accept life as the one necessary good. \u201cTo say that\nlife is absurd, consciousness must be alive\u201d (R, 6, tr.\nchanged). Living and eating \u201care themselves value\njudgments\u201d (LCE, 160). \u201cTo breathe is to\njudge\u201d (R, 8). As in his criticism of the\nexistentialists, Camus advocates a single standpoint from which to\nargue for objective validity, that of consistency.\n\nAt first blush, however, the book\u2019s subject seems to have more\nof a historical theme than a philosophical one. \u201cThe purpose of\nthis essay is \u2026 to face the reality of the present, which is\nlogical crime, and to examine meticulously the arguments by which it\nis justified; it is an attempt to understand the times in which we\nlive. One might think that a period which, in a space of fifty years,\nuproots, enslaves, or kills seventy million human beings should be\ncondemned out of hand. But its culpability must still be\nunderstood\u201d (R, 3).\n\nDo such questions represent an entirely new philosophy or are they\ncontinuous with The Myth of Sisyphus? The issue is not\nresolved by the explanations that Camus gives for his shift in the\nfirst pages of The Rebel\u2014by referring to the mass\nmurders of the middle third of the twentieth century. \u201cThe age\nof negation,\u201d he says, once fostered a concern for suicide, but\nnow in \u201cthe age of ideologies, we must examine our position in\nrelation to murder\u201d (R, 4). Have the \u201cages\u201d\nchanged in the less than ten years between the two books? He may be\nright to say that whether murder has rational foundations is\n\u201cthe question implicit in the blood and strife of this\ncentury,\u201d but in changing his focus from suicide to murder, it\nis also clear that Camus is shifting his philosophical optic from the\nindividual to our social belonging.\n\nIn so doing Camus applies the philosophy of the absurd in new, social\ndirections, and seeks to answer new, historical questions. But as we\nsee him setting this up at the beginning of The Rebel the\ncontinuity with a philosophical reading of The Stranger is\nalso strikingly clear. Novelist Kamel Daoud, retelling The\nStranger from the point of view of the victim, correctly\ncalls the murder of his Arab \u201ckinsman\u201d a\n\u201cphilosophical crime\u201d (Daoud 19). At the beginning of\nThe Rebel Camus explains:\n\nAwareness of the absurd, when we first claim to deduce a rule of\nbehavior from it, makes murder seem a matter of indifference, to say\nthe least, and hence possible. \u2026 There is no pro or con: the\nmurderer is neither right nor wrong. We are free to stoke the\ncrematory fires or to devote ourselves to the care of lepers. Evil and\nvirtue are mere chance or caprice. (R, 5)\n\n\nIf historically \u201cmurder is the problem today\u201d (R,\n5), the encounter with absurdity tells us that the same is true\nphilosophically. Having ruled out suicide, what is there to say about\nmurder?\n\nStarting from the absence of God, the key theme of Nuptials,\nand the inevitability of absurdity, the key theme of The Myth of\nSisyphus, Camus incorporates both of these into The\nRebel, but alongside them he now stresses revolt. The act of\nrebellion assumes the status of a primary datum of human experience,\nlike the Cartesian cogito taken by Sartre as his point of departure.\nCamus first expressed this directly under the inspiration of his\nencounter with Being and Nothingness. But in calling it\n\u201crevolt\u201d he takes it in a direction sharply different from\nSartre, who built from the cogito an \u201cessay in phenomenological\nontology.\u201d Ignoring completely the ontological dimension, Camus\nis now concerned with immediate issues of human social experience.\nRevolt, to be sure, still includes the rebellion against absurdity\nthat Camus described in The Myth of Sisyphus, and once again\nhe will speak of rebelling against our own mortality and the\nuniverse\u2019s meaninglessness and incoherence. But The\nRebel begins with the kind of revolt that rejects oppression and\nslavery, and protests against the world\u2019s injustice.\n\nIt is at first, like The Myth of Sisyphus, a single\nindividual\u2019s rebellion, but now Camus stresses that revolt\ncreates values, dignity, and solidarity. \u201cI revolt, therefore we\nare\u201d (R, 22) is his paradoxical statement. But how can\nan I lead to a we? How does \u201cwe are\u201d\nfollow from \u201cI revolt\u201d? How can the individual\u2019s\nexperience of absurdity, and the rebellion against it, stem from,\nproduce, imply, or entail the wider social sense of injustice and\nsolidarity? The we in fact is the subject of The\nRebel, although the title L\u2019Homme\nrevolt\u00e9 suggests that one\u2019s original\nmotivation may be individual. Acting against oppression entails having\nrecourse to social values, and at the same time joining with others in\nstruggle. On both levels solidarity is our common condition.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes the further step, which occupies\nmost of the book, of developing his notion of metaphysical and\nhistorical rebellion in opposition to the concept of revolution.\nApplying his philosophical themes directly to politics in the years\nimmediately after the Liberation of France in 1944, Camus had already\nconcluded that Marxists, and especially the Communists, were guilty of\nevading life\u2019s absurdity by aiming at a wholesale transformation\nof society, which must necessarily be violent. And now, in The\nRebel, he describes this as a major trend of modern history,\nusing similar terms to those he had used in The Myth of\nSisyphus to describe the religious and philosophical\nevasions.\n\nWhat sort of work is this? In a book so charged with political\nmeaning, Camus makes no explicitly political arguments or revelations,\nand presents little in the way of actual social analysis or concrete\nhistorical study. The Rebel is, rather, a historically framed\nphilosophical essay about underlying ideas and attitudes of\ncivilization. David Sprintzen suggests these taken-for-granted\nattitudes operate implicitly and in the background of human projects\nand very rarely become conscious (Sprintzen 1988, 123).\n\nCamus felt that it was urgent to critically examine these attitudes in\na world in which calculated murder had become common. Applying his\nabsurdist ideas and insights to politics, in The Rebel Camus\nexplains what he regards as the modern world\u2019s increasingly\norganized and catastrophic refusal to face, accept, and live with\nabsurdity. The book provides a unique perspective\u2014presenting a\ncoherent and original structure of premise, mood, description,\nphilosophy, history, and even prejudice.\n",
