    "main_text": "Public Goods\n2. Public Goods\n\n\nOlson based his analysis on Paul Samuelson\u2019s theory of public goods.\nSamuelson (1954) noted that some goods, once they are made available to\none person, can be consumed by others at no additional marginal cost;\nthis condition is commonly called jointness of supply or nonrivalness\nof consumption, because your consumption of the good does not affect\nmine, as your eating a lovely dinner would block my eating it.\nTherefore, in standard price theory, in which price tends to equate to\nmarginal cost, such goods should have a zero price. But if they are\npriced at zero, they will generally not be provided. In essence, price\ntheory commends free riding on the provision of such goods. This might\nsound like merely a cute logical problem; but standard examples include\nradio broadcasts, national defense, and clean air. If any of these is\nprovided for anyone, they are de facto provided for everyone in the\nrelevant area or group.\n\n\nThere is a second feature of Samuelson\u2019s public goods that would\nmake them problematic in practice: the impossibility of exclusion. Once\nsupplied at all, it is supposedly impossible to exclude anyone from the\nconsumption of a public good. It is often noted that this feature is\nanalytically interesting but empirically often beside the point. States\noften forcibly exclude people from enjoying such public goods as radio\nbroadcasts. Others can be provided through the use of various devices\nthat enable providers to charge the beneficiaries and to exclude those\nwho do not pay, as for example, by advertising that imposes a cost on\ntelevision viewers or the use of cable rather than broadcasting over\nthe air to provide television programming at a substantial price.\nExclusion is merely a problem of technology, not of logic. With present\ntechnology, however, it may be too expensive to exclude many people and\nwe may therefore want the state to provide many goods so that we can\navoid the costs of exclusion.\n\n\nThere are some compelling cases of goods that are both joint in\nsupply and nonexcludable. National defense that protects cities against\nattack from abroad, for example, is for all practical purposes a good\nwith both these features. But the full logic of public goods is of\nlittle practical interest for many important contexts. Indeed, what are\noften practically and politically interesting are goods that are in\nfact provided collectively, independently of whether they have either\nof the defining features of public goods. We can even provide purely\nprivate consumptions through collective choice. For example, most\nwelfare programs transfer ordinary private consumption goods or\nresources for obtaining these. Although technically these are not\npublic goods in Samuelson\u2019s sense, we can refer to them as collective\ngoods and we can treat provision of them as essentially problems of\ncollective action.\n\n\nOlson notes that very many politically provided goods, such as\nhighways and public safety, roughly have the qualities of Samuelson\u2019s\npublic goods and therefore face the problem of free riding that\nundercuts supply of the goods. Note that the supply of such goods by\nthe state overcomes the free rider problem because voters can vote on\nwhether everyone is required to pay toward the provision, as in the\ncase of national defense. If I am voting whether the good is to be\nprovided, I cannot free ride and I need not worry that anyone else can\neither. We can all vote our overall preferences between supply at the\nrelevant individual cost versus no supply and no cost of provision, so\nthat democratic choice turns our problem into a simple\ncoordination\u2014if we are all in agreement that a relevant good\nshould be collectively provided.\n\n\nFrom the analysis of the de facto logic of collective action that\nwould block the spontaneous provision of many fundamentally important\nclasses of collective goods we can go on to argue for what is now often\ncalled the public-goods theory of the state (Baumol 1952, 90\u201393; more\ngenerally see Hardin 1997). The public-goods account gives us a clear\nnormative justification of the state in welfarist terms: The state\nresolves many centrally important and potentially pervasive free rider\nproblems. It does not give us an explanatory account of the origins of\nthe state, although it could arguably contribute to the explanation of\nthe maintenance of a state once it exists. It might do so through\nsupport for the state\u2019s collective provisions and, therefore, support\nfor the state. Unfortunately, as libertarians are quick to note, giving\nthe state power to resolve certain free rider problems also gives it the\npower to do many other things that could not be justified with similar\nnormative arguments.\n",
