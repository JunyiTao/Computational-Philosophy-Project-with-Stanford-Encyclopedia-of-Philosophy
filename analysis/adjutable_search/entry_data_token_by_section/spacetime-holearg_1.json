    "main_text": "The Freedom of General Covariance\n2. The Freedom of General Covariance\n\nNewton\u2019s first law states that force-free bodies move on\nstraight-line trajectories through spacetime. Clearly, this law as\nstated cannot be true in all coordinate systems, for imagine such a\nsystem accelerating with respect to one in which the law holds true:\nin the accelerating coordinate system, the force-free bodies will also\nappear to accelerate! So Newton\u2019s first law is not\u2014to use\na piece of terminology introduced by Einstein in his quest for the\ngeneral theory of relativity in the 1910s\u2014\u2018generally\ncovariant\u2019. When Einstein finally arrived at his completed\ntheory of general relativity in 1915, one of its novel features was\nits general covariance: unlike Newton\u2019s first law in its\nformulation above, if the Einstein field equations of general\nrelativity hold in one coordinate system, then they hold true in all\ncoordinate systems related to that original system by smooth but\notherwise arbitrary transformations. General relativity was, indeed,\nthe first spacetime theory in which one was free to use arbitrary\nspacetime coordinate systems in this way. This feature is now shared\nby virtually all modern formulations of spacetime theories, including\nmodern versions of special relativity and (perhaps surprisingly!)\nNewtonian spacetime theory (on the latter, see e.g. Friedman\n(1983)).\n\nIn its original form, general covariance was understood\n\u201cpassively\u201d; that is, as a freedom to describe structures\nin spacetime by means of arbitrarily chosen coordinate systems. That\nfreedom is closely related to another freedom, known as\n\u201cactive\u201d general covariance. According to active general\ncovariance, we are licensed to spread structures like metric fields\nover the manifold in as many different ways as there are coordinate\ntransformations, and the resulting redistributions of said fields on\nthe manifold will preserve solutionhood of the theory under\nconsideration. Passive general covariance is not equivalent to active\ngeneral covariance defined in this way, for a theory can be passively\ngenerally covariant and yet arbitrary smooth redistributions of the\nfields on the manifold will in general fail to preserve solutionhood:\nthe details are not important here, but see Pooley (2017) for further\ndiscussion. (For a more extensive account of the relationship between\nactive and passive covariance, see also the supplementary document:\n Active and Passive Covariance.)[2]\n What is important is that every \u2018local\u2019 spacetime theory\n(to use terminology of Earman & Norton (1987)) is actively\ngenerally covariant, and so will be subject to a version of the hole\nargument\u2014this includes both special relativity and certain\nformulations of Newtonian mechanics. (One view is that this goes too\nfar, and that general relativity is distinct from many other spacetime\ntheories in that its spacetime geometry has become dynamical and it is\nonly in such theories that the hole argument should be mounted: for\nfurther discussion, see Earman (1989, Ch.9, Section 5), Stachel\n(1993), and Iftime and Stachel (2006).)\n\nIn what follows, we\u2019ll focus on active general covariance, which\nis indeed a property possessed by general relativity (as well as other\nlocal spacetime theories). The essential manipulation of the hole\nargument involves exercising this freedom. Figure 4 illustrates one\nway that we might spread the metrical structure and matter fields over\nthe manifold of spacetime events:\n\n\n\nFigure 4. One way to spread metric and\nmatter over the manifold.\n\n\nFigure 5 illustrates a second way:\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Another way to spread metric\nand matter over the manifold.\n\n\nWe shall call the transformation between the two spreadings a\n\u201chole transformation.\u201d The dotted region is The Hole. The\nfirst distribution of metric and matter fields is transformed into the\nsecond in a way that\n\nleaves the fields unchanged outside the hole;\nwithin the hole they are spread differently;\nand the spreadings inside and outside the hole join\n smoothly.[3]\n\n\nImportantly, both the pre- and post-transformed states in Figure 5 are\nsolutions of Einstein\u2019s field equations of general\nrelativity\u2014meaning that they both represent possible ways for\nthe world to be, according to the theory.\n",
