    "main_text": "Conclusion || The Varieties of Mathematical Structuralism\n4.1 The Varieties of Mathematical Structuralism\n\nThere were two main goals for this entry. The first was to introduce\nreaders to the general discussion of structuralism in contemporary\nphilosophy of mathematics.  The second was to provide a richer, more\ninclusive taxonomy for that discussion, including making evident that\na much larger variety of structuralist positions has played a role in\nit than is usually acknowledged.  To be sure, a certain amount of\nvariety has been recognized before, as reflected in the distinction\nbetween eliminative and non-eliminative positions, with\nShapiro\u2019s ante rem structuralism and Hellman\u2019s\nmodal structuralism as paradigms; and categorical structuralism has\nbeen acknowledged as a third main alternative. But the range of\npositions at play is much greater than that, especially in the recent\nliterature.  \u201cMathematical structuralism\u201d is not the name\nof a single position, but of a multifaceted family of them.\n\nThere are two main reasons for a more inclusive taxonomy.  The first\nis that, while numerous versions of structuralism for mathematics have\nbeen proposed, several of them have not received much attention yet,\npartly because their relationships to Shapiro\u2019s,\nHellman\u2019s, and category-theoretic positions have remained\nunclear.  The taxonomy provides some corresponding bridges. The second\nreason is that several important variants played a role already before\nthe 1960s, i.e., before the publications by Benacerraf and Putnam that\nare often seen as the starting point for debates about structuralism\nin philosophy. This concerns both methodological and metaphysical\nstructuralism, a basic distinction we highlighted; but we only hinted\nat the relevant \u201cpre-history\u201d of our topic in the present\nsurvey (We refer the reader to Reck & Schiemer forthcoming for\nmore on it.)\n",
