    "main_text": "\n\nHenry More (1614\u20131687), theologian, and philosopher, is usually\nregarded as characteristic of a group of broadly like-minded thinkers,\ndiscerned by historians and designated by them as the Cambridge\nPlatonists (Tulloch 1874, Cassirer 1953). Certainly, More\u2019s\ndualistic theology of body and soul was heavily indebted to\nNeoplatonic thought, but the philosophical theology which he developed\nthrough the 1650s and 1660s should be recognised as almost entirely\nidiosyncratic, even though, in some respects it was closely paralleled\nin the philosophy and theology of his friend and colleague, Ralph\nCudworth (1617\u20131688), and to a lesser extent in the works of his\nfollowers, George Rust (c.1628\u20131670) and Joseph\nGlanvill (1636\u20131680). More is notable as a rationalist\ntheologian who tried to use the details of the mechanical philosophy,\nas developed by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Robert Boyle and others, to\nestablish the existence of immaterial substance, or spirit and,\ntherefore, God. In particular he is known for developing a concept of\na Spirit of Nature, an intermediary between God and the world which\nwas supposedly required to account for those physical phenomena which\ncould not be explained by the mechanical philosophy, and a concept of\nan infinite absolute space which was also made to represent immaterial\nreality, and even to share a number of the attributes of God.\n",
