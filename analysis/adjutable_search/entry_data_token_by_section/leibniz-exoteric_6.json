    "main_text": "Additional Exoteric Strategies\n7. Summary\n\nThroughout his career Leibniz distinguished between esoteric and\nexoteric modes of presentation in philosophy. He endorsed the esoteric\nmode, which was modeled closely on the Geometrical model of\ndemonstration, as the ideal mode of presentation. Leibniz did some\nimportant preparatory work for an esoteric presentation of his\nmetaphysics in the 1670s and 1680s, but he never completed a work that\nwas in strict accordance with the esoteric ideal. Although he\ncontinued to regard the geometrical model of demonstration as the\nideal, he thought it would be a mistake to introduce his\nphilosophy to people in the form of an esoteric treatise. This is\nbecause the content of his philosophy was highly esoteric; it\ninvolved a range of abstract principles and theses, many of which were\nfar removed from received opinions. He thought that if he were to\npresent his philosophy in a strictly esoteric manner people would\nmisunderstand it and summarily reject it. This is why exoteric texts\nwere so important for Leibniz. They were designed to serve as\nintellectual stepping-stones that could help readers move from\nreceived opinions to esoteric truth. In letters to trusted\ncorrespondents Leibniz explicitly describes his journal articles and\nthe Essais de th\u00e9odic\u00e9e as exoteric works. But\neven Leibniz\u2019s letters to trusted correspondents such as De\nVolder and Des Bosses fall short of the esoteric ideal. All of\nLeibniz\u2019s texts are exoteric to a certain degree, but some are\nmore so than others. They can be categorized as more or less exoteric\ndepending on the degree to which they approximate the esoteric ideal\nin form and content. It is difficult to provide this categorization\ngiven that Leibniz never completed a strictly esoteric treatise.\nHowever, Leibniz\u2019s general comments about the exoteric mode of\npresentation can help us form reasonable hypotheses about the\nimplicitly exoteric features of his texts. We have seen that Leibniz\nutilized a variety of complimentary exoteric techniques,\nincluding:\n\n\n\nSelective omission: he omits the features of his philosophy that are\nfurthest removed from received opinions. In some cases it is possible\nto infer the omitted views from a careful reading of the exoteric\ntext; in other cases a supplementary work is required. \n\n\nSurface reading vs. deep reading: the text admits of an intuitive\nsurface reading that can make his views seem closer to received\nopinions than they actually are. The texts are also compatible with a\nmore rigorous but less straightforward reading; it may or may not be\npossible to grasp the deeper meaning on the basis of the exoteric text\nalone. \n\n\nFamiliar language: he tailors his language to his audience so that it\nwill appear more familiar to them. For example, he uses Cartesian\nlanguage when he writes in the journals of Paris and the language of\nthe schools when he writes in the journals of Leipzig. \n\n\nEclectic references: he appeals to the claims of well-regarded\nhistorical and contemporary figures to illustrate and motivate his own\ntheses. \n\n\nHypothesis: he presents a thesis as a hypothesis rather than providing\na strict demonstration of the thesis, even if he is capable of\nproviding the demonstration. He thinks that in some cases a reader\nwill be less hostile to a novel thesis if it is presented as a\nhypothesis. \n\n\nSensible analogies, metaphors, imaginative thought experiments,\nstories, and anecdotes: he utilizes these devices because they allow\nreaders that are accustomed to conceiving of things by means of the\nsenses and the imagination to attain an introductory understanding of\ntheses and principles that are abstract and distinctly conceivable\nonly through the intellect (not the senses or the imagination).\n\n\n\nSome work identifying particular exoteric strategies has been done in\nthe secondary literature on Leibniz. However, much work remains to be\ndone. More detailed examinations of the exoteric features of\nLeibniz\u2019s works will help us more adequately determine which\ntexts (if any) present his considered views and the extent to which\nhis philosophy is systematic.\n",
