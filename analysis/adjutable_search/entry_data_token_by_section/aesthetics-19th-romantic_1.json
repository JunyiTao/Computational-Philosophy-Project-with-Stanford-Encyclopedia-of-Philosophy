    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Reason || Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang\n2.1 Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang\n\nFor over a century, romanticism has standardly been regarded as a\nreaction against the Enlightenment (e.g., Haym 1870). The primacy of\naesthetics may seem to speak in favor of this story because, on this\ninterpretation, the romantics replaced the Enlightenment\u2019s faith\nin the sovereignty of reason with a belief in the sovereignty of art\nand the affective and imaginative capacities that are involved in\naesthetic experience. On this traditional interpretation, romanticism\nis antirationalist or irrationalist. But, while the romantic pursuit\nof the primacy of aesthetics marks a break with the Enlightenment,\nregarding romantic aesthetics as antirational or irrational and as\nantagonistic to the core Enlightenment values is unjustified for a\nhost of reasons (cf. Beiser 2003, Engell 1981, Gregory 2005).\n\nFirst, the romantics\u2019 focus on and praise for rational and\nautonomous criticism is continuous with the Enlightenment\u2019s\ncommitment to the value of rational criticism. Admiring Goetthold\nEphraim Lessing\u2019s ideal of criticism and his devotion to\nindependent thinking, Friedrich Schlegel writes, \u201ccritique is\nthe common pillar on which the entire edifice of knowledge and\nlanguage rests\u201d (Critique: 271). Rather than discontinuing the\nEnlightenment\u2019s call to submit every belief and every action to\nthe authority of rational criticism, the romantics are responsible for\ncontinuing \u201cthe age of criticism\u201d\u2014which is usually\ntaken to characterize the eighteenth century\u2014well into the\nnineteenth century. In that sense, they are the \u201cchildren\u201d\nof the Enlightenment.\n\nSecond, many of the core features of romantic aesthetics in addition\nto criticism\u2014like the relation between beauty, truth and\ngoodness, the pursuit of unity among variety and the significance of\nthe imagination and the sublime\u2014would have been impossible\nindependently of key Enlightenment thinkers.\n\nThird, the romantic elevation of aesthetic feeling and the creative\nimagination did not come at the price of their faith in and respect\nfor reason. Even Friedrich Schlegel, who is often considered to be the\nmost enthusiastically inclined romantic, opened his Lectures on\nTranscendental Philosophy by arguing that philosophy is \u201ca\nstriving towards a knowledge\u2026of the whole person\u201d (ITP:\n241). In one of his fragments, he commanded: \u201cNever tire of\ncultivating the intellect until you will have finally found what is\noriginal and essential\u201d (Ideas: #124). And yet in\nanother fragment, he claimed that one of the two centers of genuine\nphilosophy is \u201cthe rule of reason\u201d (Ideas:\n#117).\n\nSuch proclamations challenge the alleged break between the\nEnlightenment and romanticism as much as they challenge another\nstandard interpretation of romanticism, one that takes it to be a\ndirect outgrowth of Sturm und Drang, a counter-Enlightenment\nmovement that flourished in the 1760s and 1770s. Briefly, this\nresponse to the Enlightenment, expressed in works of literature,\ntheatre, music and the plastic arts, heralded individual subjectivity\nand the free expression of unconstrained feelings as the proper\nreplacements for the values of the Enlightenment.\n\nNo doubt, the romantics shared with this movement the belief in a call\n\u201cback to feeling\u201d. But regarding romanticism as simply a\ncontinuation of Sturm und Drang finds no grounding in\nromantic texts. In his review of Friedrich Jacobi, one of the main\nsources of influence on Sturm und Drang, Schlegel declared,\n\u201cOnly when striving toward truth and knowledge\ncan a spirit be called a philosophical spirit\u201d (Review of\nJacobi\u2019s Woldamer, KA II: 71\u20132). In the same review,\nSchlegel harshly criticized what is known as Jacobi\u2019s salto\nmortale or \u201cleap of faith\u201d: this is Jacobi\u2019s\nview that the only way to salvage our ethical and religious beliefs,\nin the face of the limitations of the Enlightenment, is to renounce\nreason in favor of mere sensation and faith. In contrast to\nJacobi, the German romantics never attempted to replace\nreason with faith, sensation, unconstrained feeling or intuition.\nInstead, they wished to bring out the rationality of the passions and\nthe passionate nature of reason as part of a unified and balanced\npicture of human life. Rather than a straight development of Sturm\nund Drang, then, romanticism is better understood as an attempt\nto synthesize the grain of truth in the movement with the grain of\ntruth in the philosophy of Enlightenment, or simply put, to synthesize\nreason and sensibility.\n\nSimilarly, the British and French romantics did not mean to dismiss\nreason and replace it with passion and imagination, but strived after\n\u201ca conjunction of reason and passion\u201d (Wordsworth,\n\u201cEssays on Epitaphs 1810\u201d in PWWW). Accordingly, what\nColeridge, for example, admired in Wordsworth was not imagination and\nfeeling alone, but \n\n\nthe union of deep feeling with profound thought; the fine balance of\ntruth in observing with the imaginative faculty in modifying the\nobjects observed. (Coleridge, BL: Ch. 4)\n\n\nThe romantics, then, sought to supplement but not to supplant\nreason with the receptive capacities of the mind, primarily with the\ncapacities involved in aesthetic apprehension and artistic production.\nThey extended Kant\u2019s renowned view of concepts and intuitions,\nsuggesting that reason without feeling is empty and feeling\nwithout reason is blind. Without the former, human beings would\nbe reduced to mere animality; without the latter they would lose their\nhumanity:\n\n\nWe cannot deny the drive to free ourselves, to ennoble ourselves, to\nprogress into the infinite. That would be animalistic. But we can also\nnot deny the drive to be determined, to be receptive; that would not\nbe human. (H\u00f6lderlin, Hyperion, HSA 3:194)\n\n\nFor the romantics, our receptive and spontaneous capacities could only\nbe abstracted in thought, but not separated in reality: \u201cAction\nand passion are inseparable as north and south\u201d (Novalis, FS:\n#317). Human dignity is grounded in rational and normatively\nconstrained receptivity just as much as it is grounded in spontaneity.\n\n\n\nThe restless striving after activity, the highest criterion of\njudgment, does not exclude all the virtues of receptivity but can\nonly exist with them. (F. Schlegel, KA 12: 130)\n\n\nRather than dismissing the role and the significance of reason as\nsuch, the romantics challenged merely certain uses of reason\u2014for\nexample, dogmatic uses of reason, the laying down of absolute\nfoundations, and system-building. And in a Kantian manner, they were\nconcerned to expose the limits of reason and constrain its uses to\nlegitimate boundaries. But even the romantic exposure of limits is, as\nit were, \u201caesthetic\u201d. \u201cAesthetic?\u201d one may\nask. Yes, aesthetic in the sense that some of the romantic central\ndevices for exposing the limits of reason are (originally)\n\u201caesthetic\u201d, \u201cartistic\u201d or\n\u201cliterary\u201d. \u201cRomantic Poetry\u201d is one such\ndevice and \u201cIrony\u201d is another.\n",
