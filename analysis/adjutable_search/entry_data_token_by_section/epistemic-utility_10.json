To state it, we use the\nfollowing notation: if \\(ch\\) is a probability function, we write\n\\(\\rho_{ch}\\) for the proposition that says that \\(ch\\) gives the\nobjective chances. Then:\n\n\nThe Principal Principle Rationality requires that, if\n\\(C(\\rho_{ch}) \\gt 0\\), and \\(E\\) is your total evidence, then \\(C(X\n\\mid \\rho_{ch}) = ch(X \\mid E)\\), for all \\(X\\) in your agenda. \n\n\nSo, for instance, your credence that it should rain tomorrow\nconditional on the chance of rain tomorrow given all your evidence\nbeing 76% should be 0.76.\n\nNow, as Lewis pointed out, this norm has implausible consequences if\nthe objective chance function might be modest in the presence of\nthe body of evidence \\(E\\): that is, if the true chances might be\nuncertain, given \\(E\\), that they give the true chances; that is, if\nthere is a probability function \\(ch\\) that might give the chances for\nwhich \\(ch(\\rho_{ch} \\mid E) \\lt 1\\). After all, by the Principal\nPrinciple, if \\(C(\\rho_{ch}) \\gt 0\\), then \\(C(\\rho_{ch} \\mid\n\\rho_{ch}) = ch(\\rho_{ch} \\mid E) \\lt 1\\), but by the definition of\nconditional probability, \\(C(\\rho_{ch} \\mid \\rho_{ch}) = 1\\).\nContradiction. So \\(C(\\rho_{ch}) = 0\\). That is, if some of the\npossible chance functions are modest in the presence of our evidence,\nwe must give them zero credence. And, as Lewis argued, the chances\nposited by his account, which is known as Humeanism, will indeed be\nmodest in this sense, because they will give some positive probability\nto the world being so different that its chances are also different\n(Lewis 1980; see Section 3.6 of the entry on\n Interpretations of Probability).\n\nNonetheless, if we assume that the chances are not modest, which is a\nnatural consequence of many non-Humean theories of chance, then we can\ngive an epistemic utility argument for the Principal Principle\n(Pettigrew 2013, 2022). In the first premise, we assume Continuity and\nStrict Propriety (for epistemic utility functions)\u2014either\nbecause credal veritism is true and the legitimate measures of\naccuracy are continuous and strictly proper, or for other reasons. For\nthe second premise, we assume the following decision-theoretic norm,\nwhere we say that one option strongly chance dominates another in\nthe presence of \\(E\\) if every possible chance function,\nconditional on \\(E\\), gives higher expected utility to the first than\nto the second, and we say that one option weakly chance dominates\nanother in the presence of \\(E\\) if every possible chance\nfunction, conditional on \\(E\\), gives at least as high expected\nutility to the first than to the second, and at least one possible\nchance function, conditional on \\(E\\) gives strictly higher expected\nutility to the first than to the second:\n\n\nUndominated Chance Dominance If one option is\nstrongly chance dominated by an alternative in the presence of your\ntotal evidence, and that alternative is not weakly chance dominated by\nanything in the presence of your total evidence, then rationality\nrequires you not to choose the first. \n\n\nAnd then we appeal to the following corollary of the\n Chance Dominance Theorem for the General Chance-Credence Norm,\n which we state below, to derive the\n Principal Principle:\n\n\nChance Dominance Corollary for the Principal\nPrinciple Suppose your epistemic utility function is\ncontinuous and strictly proper. And suppose no possible chance\nfunction is modest in the presence of your evidence. Then:\n\nIf a credence function does not satisfy Probabilism + Principal\nPrinciple, there is an alternative credence function that does satisfy\nProbabilism + Principal Principle such that the latter strongly chance\ndominates the former in the presence of your total evidence;\nIf a credence function does satisfy Probabilism + Principal\nPrinciple, there is no alternative credence function that even weakly\nchance dominates it in the presence of your total evidence.\n\n\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\nContinuity\n +\n Strict Propriety\n (for epistemic utility functions)\n\nUndominated Chance Dominance\n\nTherefore,\n\nProbabilism\n +\n Principal Principle\n\n\nNow, this argument does not fully justify the Principal Principle. A\nfull justification would also justify Undominated Chance Dominance by\nexplaining why chances are so special that rationality requires us to\nreject an option when the possible chance functions unanimously reject\nit. But what the justification does tell us is how we should respond\nrationally to this deference we owe to the chances. After all, there\nare alternative ways we might respond: we might say, for instance,\nthat your credence in \\(X\\) conditional on the chance of \\(X\\) being\ngreater than the chance of \\(Y\\) should be greater than your credence\nin \\(Y\\) conditional on that same chance fact. So the argument does\ngive us something.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve assumed that chances are not modest. But in fact\nwe can still say something if they are. To state the next result, we\nneed to introduce a little terminology:\n\n a set of credence functions is convex if, whenever two\ncredences functions are in it, so is any\n mixture\n of them;\n a set of credence functions is closed if, whenever there\nis an infinite sequence of credence functions in it and they approach\narbitrarily close to another credence function in the limit, then the\ncredence function they approach is also in the set;\n the closed convex hull of a set of credence functions is\nthe smallest closed and convex set that contains it; that is, for any\nother set of credence functions that is closed and convex and contains\nthat set, the closed convex hull is a subset of it.\n\n\n\nChance Dominance Theorem for Chance-Credence Norms (Pettigrew\n2022, Nielsen 2022) Suppose your epistemic utility function\nis continuous and strictly proper. Then:\n\nIf your credence function does not lie in the closed convex hull\nof the set of possible chance functions conditional on your evidence,\nthen there is an alternative credence function that does lie in that\nclosed convex hull such that the latter strongly chance dominates the\nformer;\nIf your credence function does lie in the closed convex hull of\nthe set of possible chance functions conditional on your evidence,\nthen there is no alternative credence function that weakly chance\ndominates it.\n\n\n\nSee the\n supplementary materials\nfor a sketch of how the proof of (i) follows from the Dominance\nTheorem for Convex Hulls.\n\nTogether with Continuity + Strict Propriety (for epistemic utility\nfunctions) and Undominated Chance Dominance, this tells us that\nrationality requires us to have a credence function that lies in the\nclosed convex hull of the possible chance functions. Now of course\nthat isn\u2019t a terribly intuitive condition. However, for various\nproperties weaker than immodesty that chance functions might all have,\nthis does entail that your credence function should also have that\nproperty as well: all that is required is that, whenever two credence\nfunctions have the property, any\n mixture\n of them does as well. Here are two such properties:\n\n \\(C\\) is chance expectational in the presence of \\(E\\)\nif, for all \\(X\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), \n\\[\nC(X) = \\sum_{ch} C(\\rho_{ch})ch(X \\mid E)\n\\]\n \n \\(C\\) trusts the chances in the presence of \\(E\\) if,\nfor all \\(X\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), \n\\[\nC(X \\mid ch(X \\mid E) \\geq x) \\geq x\n\\]\n \n\n\nBoth are preserved under taking\n mixtures\n and so the Chance Dominance Theorem for Chance-Credence Norms gives\narguments for the following two chance-credence principles, if the\nchances have the appropriate properties:\n\n General Recipe (Ismael 2008) Rationality\nrequires you to have a credence function that is chance expectational\nin the presence of your total evidence.\n Chance Trust Principle (Levinstein 2023)\nRationality requires you to trust the chances in the presence of your\ntotal evidence.\n\n\nHowever, Levinstein and Spencer (ms.) argue that the sort of Humean\naccount of chance that posits modest chance functions will also posit\nchance functions that are neither chance-expectational nor trusting of\nthemselves as chances. So, for such accounts, these arguments for the\nweaker chance-credence principles will not work.\n\nLevinstein (2023) offers a different epistemic utility argument for\nthe Chance Trust Principle. Undominated Chance Dominance is intended\nto capture the claim that rationality requires us to defer to the\nchances, and proposes a precise formulation of that demand. Levinstein\noffers a different formulation. To defer to the chances epistemically\nis to expect them to have greater expected epistemic utility than you\nexpect yourself to have (unless you are certain your credences match\nthe chances, in which case you expect them to have exactly as much\nepistemic utility as you expect yourself to have). And, what\u2019s\nmore, you expect this regardless of the epistemic utility function you\nuse: provided it satisfies\n Additivity,\n Continuity, and\n Strict Propriety,\n if you\u2019re uncertain what the chances are, you should expect\nthem to do better than you expect your own credences to do. And,\nLevinstein shows, if you do defer in this way, then you satisfy the\nChance Trust Principle.\n",
