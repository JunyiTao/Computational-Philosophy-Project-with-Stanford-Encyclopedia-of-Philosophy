    "main_text": "George Campbell on miracles\n6. George Campbell on miracles\n\nKames did not dedicate an entire book to an attack on Hume on\nreligion, but George Campbell (1719\u20131796) did. This interesting\nman, a student at Marischal College, Aberdeen, of which in 1759 he\nbecame Principal, was a founder-member of the Aberdeen Philosophical\nSociety, the \u2018Wise Cub\u2019, which also included Thomas Reid,\nJohn Gregory, David Skene, Alexander Gerard, James Beattie and James\nDunbar. It is probable that many of Campbell\u2019s writings began\nlife as papers to the Club. In 1763 he published A Dissertation on\nMiracles which was intended as a demolition of Hume\u2019s essay\n\u2018On miracles\u2019, Chapter Ten in An Enquiry Concerning\nHuman Understanding. Miracles were commonly discussed in\neighteenth century Scotland. On the one hand the Kirk required people\nto accept miracle claims on the basis either of eyewitness reports or\nof reports of such reports, and on the other hand the spirit of\nEnlightenment required that claims based on the authority of others be\nput before the tribunal of reason. Hume focuses especially on the\ncredibility of testimony, and argues that the credence we place in\ntestimony is based entirely on experience, the experience of the\noccasions when testimony has turned out to be true as against those\nexperiences where it has not. Likewise it is on the basis of\nexperience that we judge whether a reported event occurred. If the\nreported event is improbable we ask how probable it is that the\neyewitness is speaking truly. We have to balance the probability that\nthe eyewitness is speaking truly against the improbability of the\noccurrence of the event. Hume held that the improbability of a miracle\nis always so great that no testimony could tell effectively in its\nfavour. The wise man, proportioning his belief to the evidence, would\nbelieve that the testimony in favour of the miracle is false.\n\nCampbell\u2019s opening move against this argument is to reject\nHume\u2019s premiss that we believe testimony solely on the basis of\nexperience. For, according to Campbell, there is in all of us a\nnatural tendency to believe other people. This is not a learned\nresponse based on repeated experience but an innate disposition. In\npractice this principle of credulity is gradually finessed in the\nlight of experience. Once testimony is placed before us it becomes the\ndefault position, something that is true unless or until proved false,\nnot false unless or until proved true. The credence we give to\ntestimony is much like the credence we give to memory. It is the\ndefault position as regards beliefs about the past, even though in the\nlight of experience we might withhold belief from some of its\ndeliverances.\n\nBecause our tendency to accept testimony is innate, it is harder to\noverturn than Hume believes it to be. Campbell considers the case of a\nferry that has safely made a crossing two thousand times. I, who have\nseen these safe crossings, meet a stranger who tells me solemnly that\nhe has just seen the boat sink taking with it all on board. The\nlikelihood of my believing this testimony is greater than would be\nimplied by Hume\u2019s formula for determining the balance of\nprobabilities. Reid, a close friend of Campbell\u2019s, likewise gave\nmassive emphasis to the role of testimony, stressing both the innate\nnature of the credence we give to testimony and also the very great\nproportion of our knowledge of the world that we gain, not through\nperception or reason, but through the testimony of others.\nReid\u2019s comparison of the credence we naturally give to the\ntestimony of others and the credence we naturally give to the\ndeliverances of our senses, is one of the central features of his\nInquiry into the Human Mind (1764).\n",
