    "main_text": "Metaphysics of Mechanisms || Mechanisms, Levels, and Emergence\n4.2 Mechanisms, Levels, and Emergence\nWork on mechanisms has also helped to clarify the idea of levels of\norganization and its relation to other forms of organization and\nnon-mechanistic forms of emergence.\nMany mechanists, following Simon (1996 [1962]), emphasize that\nbiological systems are hierarchically organized into near-decomposable\nstructures: mechanisms within mechanisms, within mechanism. Using the\nparable of Tempus and Hora, Simon (1962) argued that a watchmaker who\nbuilds hierarchically decomposable watches (Tempus) will make more\nwatches than one who builds holistic watches (Hora). This parable led\nSimon to the conclusion that evolved structures are more likely to be\nnearly decomposable into hierarchically organized, more or less stable\nstructures and sub-structures. Some have objected that the story is\nmisleading because evolution does not construct organisms from\nscratch, piece by piece (Bechtel 2009b). Steel (2008), building on the\nwork of others (Schlosser and Wagner 2004), therefore attempts to\nreconstruct this argument as a way of showing that evolved systems are\nmore likely to be modular: systems made of independently manipulable\nparts can quarantine the effects of changes to specific parts, giving\nthem added flexibility to make local changes without causing\ncatastrophic side-effects.\nThe near decomposability of mechanisms is directly related to the\nidea that mechanisms span multiple levels of organization. The\nbehavior of the whole is explained in terms of the activities and\ninteractions among the component parts. These activities and\ninteractions are themselves sustained by underlying activities and\ninteractions among component parts, and so on (see Bechtel and\nRichardson 2010 [1993]).  Craver (2007) defines levels of mechanisms\nin terms of a relationship between the behavior (\u03c8) exhibited\nby a system (S) and the activity (\u03c6) of some component\npart (X) of that system. On this\naccount, X\u2019s \u03c6-ing is at a lower level of mechanistic\norganization than S\u2019s \u03c8-ing if and only if (i) X\nis a part of S, and (ii) X\u2019s \u03c6-ing is a component\nin S\u2019s \u03c8-ing. In short, to say that something is at a\nlower mechanistic level than the mechanism as a whole is to say that\nit is a working part of the mechanism. Though the term\n\u201clevel\u201d is used in many legitimate ways,\nlevels of mechanisms seem to play a central role in structuring the\nrelations among many different models in contemporary biology (e.g.,\nbetween Mendelian and molecular genetics (Darden 2006), between\nlearning and memory and channel physiology (Craver 2007), and between\npopulation-level variation and developmental mechanisms (Tabery 2009,\n2014a)).\nOne implication of this view of levels, combined with certain\nfamiliar assumptions about causal relations, is that there can be no\ncausal relationships between items at different levels of mechanisms.\nThere can be causal relationships between things of different sizes,\nand there can be causal relationships between things described in very\ndifferent vocabularies; but (again, conjoined with certain assumptions\nabout the temporal asymmetry of cause and effect and the independence\nof cause and effect) there cannot be causal relationships between the\nbehavior of a mechanism and the activities of the parts that jointly\nconstitute that behavior. Claims about interlevel causation, which are\nubiquitous in the scientific literature, are best understood either as\ntargeting a different sense of levels or, concerning levels of\nmechanisms, as expressing hybrid claims combining constitutive claims\nabout the relationship between the behavior of the mechanism as a\nwhole and the activities of its parts, and causal claims concerning\nrelationships between things not related as part and whole (Craver and\nBechtel 2007). For alternative interpretations of levels, see Fehr\n2004; Leuridan 2011; Thalos 2013; Eronen\n2013; 2015; Baumgartner\nand Gebhardter forthcoming; Romero\nforthcoming. For\nreflections on the metaphysical status of higher-level phenomena and\nhigher-level causes, see Baumgartner 2010; Glennan\n2010 a, b; Hoffman-Kolss 2014, as\nwell as the entries on \n causation and manipulability,\n physicalism, and\n scientific reduction.\nAs noted above, the fact that phenomena at higher levels of\nmechanisms depend upon the organization of component parts entails\nthat the properties/activities of wholes are not simple sums of the\nproperties/activities of the parts. Levels of mechanisms can thus be\ncontrasted with levels of mere aggregation. Because the whole is\ngreater (in this sense) than the sum of the parts, some (such as\nWimsatt) have found it appropriate to describe this as a kind of\nemergence. Mechanistic (or organizational) emergence thus\nunderstood is ubiquitous and banal but extremely important for\nunderstanding how scientists explain things.\nAlso familiar is epistemic emergence, the inability to\npredict the properties or behaviors of wholes from properties and\nbehaviors of the parts. Epistemic emergence can arise as a result of\nignorance, such as failing to recognize a relevant variable, or from\nfailing to know how different variables interact in complex networks.\nIt might also result from limitations on human cognitive abilities or\nin current-generation representational tools (Bedau 1997; Boogerd\n2005; Richardson and Stephan 2007). The practical necessity of\nstudying mechanisms by decomposing them into component parts raises\nthe epistemic challenge of putting the parts back together again in a\nway that actually works (Bechtel 2013a).\nThe mechanists\u2019 emphasis on mechanistic/organizational and\nepistemic emergence contrasts with their desire to distance themselves\nfrom spooky emergence (Richardson and Stephan 2007). Spooky emergence\nwould involve the appearance of new properties with no sufficient\nbasis in mechanisms. It is not clear that emergent properties are\nproperly said to be properties of the necessary mechanisms; and it is\nnot clear in what since the emergent property is\n\u201cemergent\u201d rather than a fundamental feature of the causal\nstructure of the world.\nIn short, such forms of emergence are altogether distinct from, and\nso gain no plausibility from, verbal association with\norganizational/mechanistic and epistemic emergence.\n",
