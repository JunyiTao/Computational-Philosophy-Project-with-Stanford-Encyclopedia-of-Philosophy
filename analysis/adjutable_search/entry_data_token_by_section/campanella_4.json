    "main_text": "The Universal Monarchy\n5. The Universal Monarchy\n\nThe City of the Sun is Campanella\u2019s best-known work today,\nbut it is not the only expression of his political thought, which was\nmultifaceted and which evolved over the course of his life, from his\nyouthful days until his final years of exile in Paris. An important\ntextual consideration is that while Campanella started writing his\nutopia in Italian soon after being sentenced to life imprisonment, at\nmore or less the same time he was working on a series of political aphorisms,\nalso in Italian. He eventually translated both texts into Latin,\nplacing the Civitas Solis as an appendix to the aphorisms,\nwhich now took the form of a treatise covering both theoretical and\npractical aspects of politics and government. The Politica\nand its appendix, together with four political quaestiones\nin which he also theorized about the utopian genre, constitute\nthe third part of his Philosophia realis (Frankfurt, 1623;\nParis, 1637). The shared trajectory of his general treatise on\npolitics and his utopia provides a clear indication of how different\naspects and expressions of his political thought were intertwined.\n\nWhile the Politica was Campanella\u2019s most analytic\ntreatise on the subject, he also articulated his political ideas in\nmany other writings. Apart from numerous works linked to particular\nmoments in the complex itinerary of his life and his thought, his\npolitical writings form part of a more general philosophical\nframework, which often makes it difficult to consider them on their\nown, since they are located in a zone that borders on theology, ethics\nand natural philosophy. It is not surprising, therefore, that it is\nprecisely in this area, so full of contradictions and ambiguities,\nthat the debate among his interpreters is most lively and most\nenflamed by polemics. It is difficult to reconcile the prophet of the\nCalabrian conspiracy, who, reading celestial and natural signs,\nproclaimed the advent of an epoch of profound renewal, with the\ndefender of the unconditional primacy of the papacy; or the thinker\nwho believed in the \u201cidea\u201d of a philosophical republic in\nwhich everything would be governed according to nature with the\nsupporter of a universal monarchy under the king of Spain; or,\nfinally, the harsh critic of Machiavelli, whom he accused of having\ncut the bonds between politics, ethics and religion, with the subtle\npolitician who in his writings frequently supported some of the most\nunscrupulous Machiavellian maxims. Campanella\u2019s reading of Machiavelli\nleft such an impression on his works that even his early readers did\nnot hesitate to define him as a \u201charsh critic and at the same\ntime a disguised master of Machiavelli\u2019s precepts\u201d (Hermann\nConring\u2019s introduction to the Latin translation of Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrince, in his Opera, 5 vols, Braunschweig 1730, II,\np. 979) and to affirm that he had relaunched on the scene, suitably\ncamouflaged and consequently in a more insidious manner, the same\nprinciples that Machiavelli had had the courage to express without\ndisguise (Conring, De civili prudentia, in his\nOpera, III, p. 41).\n\nThere is no doubt that Campanella\u2019s reflections on Machiavelli, and on\n\u201cpoliticians\u201d in general, constituted one of the most\nforceful aspects of his thought. His deliberations focused, above all,\non two closely connected points. On the one hand, he underlined the\nphilosophical limits of Machiavelli\u2019s theories\u2014limits that made\nhis political constructions inherently fragile. On the other hand, he\ndeveloped and inserted into a Catholic and Counter-Reformation context\nan element that was already present in Machiavelli, especially in his\nDiscourses on the First Decade of Livy: the view of religion\nas one of the most powerful bonds in the human community.\n\nBoth these elements are found in a central text of Campanella\u2019s\npolitical thought, the Monarchia di Spagna (Monarchy of\nSpain). Right from the outset, he expresses the doctrine of the\nthree causes that are at the origin of political\nassociations\u2014God, prudence and expediency\u2014in order to\nhighlight the inadequacy of a vision of history, characteristic of\npoliticians, that is limited solely to human causes. The first cause,\nthat rules and governs the others and that is always present, even if\nin hidden ways, in all historical events is, of course, God. This\nmeans that a skillful and shrewd politician must endeavor to integrate\nempirical causes into more general ones. To this end, it is\nindispensable to have recourse to the \u201chighest sciences\u201d\nof prophecy and of astrology, that enable one to insert particular\nevents into a universal background.\n\nAppealing to biblical texts, Campanella maintains that the Spanish\nsovereign can aspire to the monarchy of the world if he takes\ninspiration from the model of Cyrus, invested by God, as Isaiah (45.1)\nconfirms, with the mission of liberating the Church from infidels and\nof bringing together all peoples under a single faith. For the\nCatholic king the only practical way of achieving his own universal\nplans is through a firm accord with the Church and with the pope,\nfollowing the example of Constantine and Charlemagne. Campanella\nfurther stresses that religion is the most powerful bond of political\nunity. Machiavelli, too, had emphasized the strength of this bond,\nwhen analyzing the events of the Roman Republic, but then had\ncondemned the Christian religion as a cause of weakness, strife and\ndivisions. Campanella has no doubt that religion, whether true or\nfalse, is the primary and most powerful unifying force in the\npolitical body, in that it rules over souls and brings them together,\nand that all other ties between human beings depend on it.\n\nThe two other primary causes of political associations are prudence\nand expediency. Here another key element in Campanella\u2019s thought comes\ninto play: the return to nature. Political associations, like all\nother natural entities, are living organisms. The main task of\npolitical action will therefore be to promote the most effective union\namong its members. The virtue specific to this activity is prudence,\nwhich has the job of reinforcing natural bonds and coming up with\nunifying techniques designed to strengthen the ties of individuals\nwith the whole, of integrating unlike with like and of attenuating the\nmost violent conflicts, so that the result is the correct functioning\nand prosperity of the entire organism. When he speaks of prudence,\nCampanella insists on distinguishing it from Machiavellian cunning and\nfrom \u201creason of state,\u201d drawing on various clever and\nsubtle contrasts and distinctions. While prudence is an instrument of\norganic unity, cunning and reason of state are nothing but techniques\ndesigned to affirm individualistic egoism and, for this reason, are\ndoomed to failure, as is amply demonstrated by the tragic end of\nMachiavellian heroes, whose successes are revealed to be merely\napparent or ephemeral, or by the sad life of tyrants, constantly\nplagued by suspicions and fears. The wise politician is one who,\nhaving as his aim the solidarity and well-being of the whole\ncommunity, is in a position to promote three different types of bond.\nFirst of all, there is the bond of souls, achieved by the impetus\ngiven to the humanities and sciences and to religion. Secondly, there\nis the bond of bodies, in relation to which Campanella insists on the\nexpediency of increasing marriages by all available means, encouraging\nunions between individuals of different physical constitution and\ntemperament and between the Spanish and other nations, in order both\nto spread Spanishness to other nations and to temper the vices of the\nSpanish people, who often arouse hatred for their humility when\nserving and for their pride when commanding. The third bond is that of\ngoods of fortune; here it is a case of encouraging the economic\nprosperity of people by means of developing commerce and especially\nnavigation, the vital lymphatic system that makes it possible to unite\ndistant lands and to connect the separate limbs of the empire.\n\nThe stance adopted by Campanella in relation to universal monarchy is\ndirectly linked to the prophetic ideal of re-uniting humanity in a\n\u201csingle fold under one shepherd.\u201d The central text for\nthis topic is Monarchia del Messia (Monarchy of the\nMessiah). The original unity of king and priest, which derives\nfrom the divine unity, permits human beings, after the multiplicity of\nsects introduced by the devil and fomented by ambition and ignorance,\nto return to a single priestly law, under which the entire human race\ncan come together, transcending divisions and conflicts. According to\nCampanella, Adam and Hermes Trismegistus were simultaneously kings,\npriests and wise men. Uniting kingship and priesthood in the same\nperson is extremely advantageous and auspicious, for the people will\nmore willingly obey those whom they believe have their authority from\nGod; and their laws will be more respected and observed, whether in\npublic or in the inner sanctum of the human heart. The epoch in which\na king-priest will reign is described by Campanella as a golden age,\nin which there will be an end to the evils that afflict humanity: wars\nwill no longer have any reason to exist; famine and scarcity will\ncease because the barrenness of certain countries will be corrected\nand supplemented by the abundance of foodstuffs produced in other\ncountries; plagues will disappear because it will be possible to\ntransfer people to salubrious lands free from contagion; finally,\nthere will be a wondrous flourishing of all forms of knowledge thanks\nto exchanges of information and to communication, bringing great\nbenefits to humanity (Monarchia del Messia, pp. 62\u201363). The\ndivision and the separation of human beings are always the devil\u2019s\nwork; envious of the good that comes from unity, he induces people to\nforget that they are all children of the same God and of the same\nfather, Adam, and therefore siblings.\n",
