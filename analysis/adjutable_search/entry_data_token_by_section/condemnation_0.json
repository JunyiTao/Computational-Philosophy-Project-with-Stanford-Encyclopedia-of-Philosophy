The events leading up to March 7, 1277\n\nThe traditional picture of the events leading to Bishop\nTempier\u2019s condemnation looks something like this. On January 18,\n1277 Pope John XXI informed Stephen Tempier, Bishop of Paris, in a\nletter that he had heard rumors of heresy and charged him with the\ntask of examining (facias inspici vel inquiri) where and by\nwhom these errors had been disseminated (CUP 1: 541). On March 7,\n1277, Bishop Tempier published his list of 219 theological and\nphilosophical theses (articuli) and of some books that were\ncondemned. Anyone teaching or listening to the listed errors would be\nexcommunicated, unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the\nchancellor within seven days, in which case the bishop would inflict\nproportionate penalties (CUP 1: 543).\n\nSince this papal letter precedes Tempier\u2019s condemnation, it has\nbeen generally assumed that Tempier acted on papal initiative, and\nmoreover, acted in an overzealous and hasty way. In his letter, the\npope merely requested Tempier to investigate rumors of false teaching,\nwhereas the latter responded by drawing up a list of 219 false\npropositions. Furthermore, only about six weeks elapsed between the\npapal instructions and Tempier\u2019s publication of this list, a\nlist which has been characterized by historians as repetitious and\ndisorderly.\n\nUnfortunately, the chain of events leading up to Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation still is not totally clear. If Tempier, indeed, acted on\na papal mandate, it is surprising that he does not mention it in the\nintroduction to his syllabus of errors, but merely indicates that he\nhad received information from important people (Who these\n\u201cimportant people\u201d may have been is a question that will\nbe addressed below).\n\nAnother puzzling aspect concerning the course of events sketched above\nis the papal letter \u201cFlumen aquae vivae\u201d of April\n28, 1277, that is, more than forty days after Tempier had promulgated\nhis list of condemned articles. Curiously enough, this letter gives no\nindication whatsoever that the pope knew about Tempier\u2019s action.\nOn the contrary, the pope grants a mandate to Tempier to notify him,\nthe pope, about new errors, and to inform him about the names of the\npropagators of these errors, about their followers, and about their\nwritings. Pope John\u2019s second letter is a further specification\nof his first: he now indicates the culprits, namely \u201csome\nscholars of arts and in the faculty of theology at Paris\u201d\n(nonnulli tam in artibus quam in theologica facultate studentes\nParisius). In addition, its purpose is more focused. The pope\nwill use the dossier that he has requested from the bishop to\nestablish \u2013 with the help of an advisory committee \u2013 the\nnature of the errors and to decide whether they will have to be\nrecanted, or condemned and whether the University of Paris will need\nto be reformed.\n\nIn short, the evidence also allows another scenario, namely that\nTempier did not act on the pope\u2019s instigation, but was already\nin the process of preparing his condemnation when he received the\npapal letter of January 18, 1277. In this scenario of events, the\npapal letter Flumen aquae vivae crossed the letter in which\nTempier announced the condemnation.\n",
