    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is wisdom?  Philosophers, psychologists, spiritual leaders,\npoets, novelists, life coaches, and a variety of other important\nthinkers have tried to understand the concept of wisdom.  This entry\nwill provide a brief and general overview, and analysis of, several\nphilosophical views on the topic of wisdom.  It is not intended to\ncapture the many interesting and important approaches to wisdom found\nin other fields of inquiry. Moreover, this entry will focus on several\nmajor ideas in the Western philosophical tradition.  In particular, it\nwill focus on five general approaches to understanding what it takes\nto be wise: (1) wisdom as epistemic humility, (2) wisdom as epistemic\naccuracy, (3) wisdom as knowledge, (4) a hybrid theory of wisdom, and\n(5) wisdom as rationality.\n",
