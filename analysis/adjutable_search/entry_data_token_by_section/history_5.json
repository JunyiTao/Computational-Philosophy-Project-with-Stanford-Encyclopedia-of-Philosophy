    "main_text": "Continental philosophy of history || Universal or historical human nature?\n2.1 Universal or historical human nature?\n\nHuman beings make history; but what is the fundamental nature of the\nhuman being? Is there one fundamental \u201chuman nature,\u201d or\nare the most basic features of humanity historically conditioned\n(Mandelbaum 1971)? Can the study of history shed light on this\nquestion? When we study different historical epochs, do we learn\nsomething about unchanging human beings\u2014or do we learn about\nfundamental differences of motivation, reasoning, desire, and\ncollectivity? Is humanity a historical product? Giambattista\nVico\u2019s New Science (1725) offered an interpretation of\nhistory that turned on the idea of a universal human nature and a\nuniversal history (see Berlin 2000 for commentary). Vico\u2019s\ninterpretation of the history of civilization offers the view that\nthere is an underlying uniformity in human nature across historical\nsettings that permits explanation of historical actions and processes.\nThe common features of human nature give rise to a fixed series of\nstages of development of civil society, law, commerce, and government:\nuniversal human beings, faced with recurring civilizational\nchallenges, produce the same set of responses over time. Two things\nare worth noting about this perspective on history: first, that it\nsimplifies the task of interpreting and explaining history (because we\ncan take it as given that we can understand the actors of the past\nbased on our own experiences and nature); and second, it has an\nintellectual heir in twentieth-century social science theory in the\nform of rational choice theory as a basis for comprehensive social\nexplanation.\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder offers a strikingly different view about human\nnature and human ideas and motivations. Herder argues for the\nhistorical contextuality of human nature in his work, Ideas for\nthe Philosophy of History of Humanity (1791). He offers a\nhistoricized understanding of human nature, advocating the idea that\nhuman nature is itself a historical product and that human beings act\ndifferently in different periods of historical development\n(1800\u20131877, 1791). Herder\u2019s views set the stage for the\nhistoricist philosophy of human nature later found in such\nnineteenth-century figures as Hegel and Nietzsche. His perspective too\nprefigures an important current of thought about the social world in\nthe late twentieth century, the idea of the \u201csocial\nconstruction\u201d of human nature and social identities (Anderson\n1983; Hacking 1999; Foucault 1971).\n",
