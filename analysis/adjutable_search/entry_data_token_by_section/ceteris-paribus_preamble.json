    "main_text": "\n\nLaws of nature take center stage in philosophy of science and\nmetaphysics. Laws are usually believed to stand in tight relations to\nmany philosophical key concepts such as causation, explanation,\nconfirmation, determinism, and counterfactuals. Traditionally,\nphilosophers have focused on physical laws, which were taken to be at\nleast true, universal statements that support counterfactual claims.\nBut, although this claim about laws might be true with respect to\nphysics, laws in the special sciences (such as biology, psychology,\nand economics) appear to have\u2014maybe not\nsurprisingly\u2014different features than the laws of physics.\nSpecial science laws\u2014for instance, the economic law \u201cUnder\nthe condition of perfect competition, an increase of demand of a\ncommodity leads to an increase of price, given that the quantity of\nthe supplied commodity remains constant\u201d and, in biology,\nMendel\u2019s Laws\u2014are usually taken to \u201chave\nexceptions\u201d, to be \u201cnon-universal\u201d or to be\n\u201cceteris paribus laws\u201d. How and whether the laws\nof physics and the laws of the special sciences differ is one of the\ncrucial questions motivating the debate on ceteris paribus\nlaws. Another major, controversial question concerns the determination\nof the precise meaning of \u201cceteris paribus\u201d.\nPhilosophers have attempted to explicate the meaning of ceteris\nparibus clauses in different ways. The question of meaning is\nconnected to the problem of empirical content, i.e., the question\nwhether ceteris paribus laws have non-trivial and empirically\ntestable content. Since many philosophers have argued that ceteris\nparibus laws lack empirically testable content, this problem\nconstitutes a major challenge to a theory of ceteris paribus\nlaws.\n",
