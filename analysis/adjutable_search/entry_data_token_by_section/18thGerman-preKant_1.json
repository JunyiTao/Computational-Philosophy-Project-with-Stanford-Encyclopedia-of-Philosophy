    "main_text": "Christian Thomasius || Philosophy\n1.2 Philosophy\n\nThomasius is decidedly not a systematic philosopher; instead, and\nquite consistent with his mature distaste for dogmatism in all its\nforms, he is best characterized as a conscientiously eclectic thinker\n(M. Albrecht 1994: 398\u2013416; Bottin & Longo 2015:\n301\u2013315). That said, Thomasius\u2019 thought is unified by an\noverarching conviction in the priority of practical life, and the\nbelief that erudition in whatever sphere of knowledge should be\npursued for the sake of the improvement of our will and intellect for\nuse in our ordinary life. This is made clear, for instance, in the\ndefinition of learnedness (\u201cGelahrheit\u201d) that\nThomasius provides at the outset of his Introduction to the\nDoctrine of Reason:\n\n\nLearnedness is knowledge through which the human being is made capable\nof properly distinguishing the true from the false and the good from\nthe bad [\u2026] in order that one might promote one\u2019s own\ntemporal and lasting welfare, and that of others, in ordinary life and\naffairs. (Thomasius 1691a: ch. 1, \u00a71 [2019: 18])\n\n\nSignificantly, and unlike subsequent Enlightenment thinkers, Thomasius\nis also explicit in holding that because the attainment of learnedness\nis possible wholly through the use of the natural (rather than the\nsupernatural) light of the mind (cf. Thomasius 1691a: ch. 1,\n\u00a716), it is accessible by all, regardless of gender or class (for\nmore on this, see\n \u00a76.1,\n below).\n\nIn light of this, the aim of logic for Thomasius is to cultivate the\npowers of the mind, and the faculty of reason in particular, so that\nwe are capable of discerning what the natural light of the mind\nreveals to be true or false in any field to which it is applied. This\ninvolves not just supplying positive guidance with respect to how\ntruth might be recognized and attained, but also negatively\nidentifying and dispelling prejudices that obscure the natural light.\nThomasius\u2019 logic, therefore, is not primarily intended to offer\na theory of demonstration (as with scholastic logics) nor an organon\nfor specifically scientific discovery (as with Cartesian logics or,\nlater, with Wolff\u2019s logic). This distinctive aim does not,\nhowever, prevent him from weighing in on matters of traditional\nlogical and epistemological import; for instance, he contends that\nthought has to do with images ultimately derived from the external\nsenses (thereby rejecting innate ideas\u2014Thomasius 1691a: ch. 3,\n\u00a722), and he outlines a theory of demonstration that focuses on\npreserving conviction in truths through their connection to\nincontrovertible first principles.\n\nThomasius\u2019 Application of the Doctrine of Reason\ncontributes to the project initiated in the Introduction by\noutlining the means of avoiding error. Avoiding error involves the\neradication of prejudices, which are among the causes of the\ncorruption of reason and which are grouped into two main groups,\nnamely, prejudices of authority and of precipitancy or hastiness.\nThat, in turn, is accomplished through what he identifies as dogmatic\ndoubt, not the Cartesian doubt that deems everything false so as to\nfind a first indubitable principle, which is a pointless enterprise,\naccording to Thomasius. Dogmatic doubt is the doubt about particular\nthings, beliefs, and opinions, and this he found healthy and conducive\nto preventing error.\n\nIn any case, the centrepiece of Thomasius\u2019 logic, and probably\nits most influential aspect, is his theory of truth. According to\nThomasius\u2019 definition, truth consists in\n\n\nnothing other than an agreement between human thoughts and the\nconstitution of things outside your thoughts. (Thomasius 1691a:\nch. 5, \u00a713 [2019: 28]; italics in original)\n\n\nWhile this definition contains the classical correspondence\ntheory of truth (in accordance with which truth consists in the\ncorrespondence of our thoughts with things), Thomasius contends that\nthe correspondence works in the other direction as well, namely, that\ntruth also requires the correspondence of things with our powers of\nthought:\n\n\nHere, however, you should not ask whether the understanding must agree\nwith things, or the things with the understanding; rather this harmony\nis so constituted that neither provides the guiding principle for the\nother, but this harmony is simultaneously presupposed by both even\nthough external things as it were initiate it. (Thomasius 1691a: ch.\n5, \u00a714 [2019: 28])\n\n\nIn accordance with this conception of truth, Thomasius conceives of\nthe mind as fundamentally active with its ideas (rather than merely\npassively reflecting the order of nature) such that things must be in\nagreement with its nature and capacities in order to be cognized or\nwilled. Thomasius does not himself explore the principles that might\ngovern the mind\u2019s activity nor draw any idealistic consequences\nfrom this conception of truth\u2014that, for instance, things insofar\nas they agree with our intellect might differ considered apart from\nit\u2014though his successors such as Adolph Friedrich Hoffmann and\nChristian August Crusius would (on the latter, see\n \u00a75.2\n below).\n\nThis conception of the human mind as fundamentally active is taken up\nagain in Thomasius\u2019 lone substantial contribution to\nmetaphysics, the Essay on the Essence of Spirit, where\nThomasius distinguishes spirit (Geist) from matter in virtue\nof its activity. While this would appear to result in a metaphysical\ndualism, Thomasius complicates things by endorsing a hierarchy of\nspirits, not just between the human being and God, but also a class of\nspirits responsible for various effects in bodies (such as heating and\ncooling). Yet, his further postulation of an \u201cair and light\nspirit [ein Lufft- und Licht-Geist]\u201d which fills the\nspaces between parts of matter, not to mention his apparent\nidentification of space itself as \u201cpure spirit\u201d (Thomasius\n1709: 60, 167\u20138) muddles the original, starkly dualistic\npicture.\n\nThomasius\u2019s moral theory is a theory of the will. He held that\nin moral matters, the will dominates reason. While human beings have\nfree choice if not externally constrained, the will is not free;\nrather, it is dominated by human affects\u2014our passions, impulses,\nand desires. Like Hobbes, Thomasius believed that even though subject\nto such inner (psychological) constraints, the will still chooses\n(with the aid of reason); it consciously wills. And a conscious choice\nis precisely what is required for a (good) action to be considered\nmoral: a good instinct or good inclinations may make us good, may even\nbe desirable, but by itself this is not enough to make us moral.\nMorality requires a conscious act of will. The trouble with morality\narises because the will is determined by evil desires, in particular,\nlust, ambition, and avarice. Although there are noble sentiments as\nwell, which similarly influence the will, they are in conflict with\nthe negative dispositions. The conflict can be brought to a positive\nconclusion only by appeal to divine grace (God\u2019s salvation), and\nThomasius Application of the Doctrine of Morals is notable\nfor its positive treatment of mystical experience.\n\nThomasius\u2019 moral philosophy is accordingly informed by\ntheological considerations in a way not shared by his works in\ntheoretical philosophy. While, in the theoretical context, he did\nbelieve in natural reason\u2019s capacity to overcome corruption, in\nthe practical context he held that an evil will is at the root of our\ncorruption, and to ameliorate it we require God\u2019s grace.\nMoreover, Thomasius\u2019s moral outlook seems to develop from his\ninitial presentation of morality in the Introduction to the\nDoctrine of Morals in 1692, which is an optimistic affirmation of\nthe viability of a moral position he identified as one involving\n\u201crational love\u201d (vern\u00fcnftige Liebe) as the\nonly means to a \u201chappy, courteous and cheerful life\u201d, to a\nmore pessimistic position in his Application in 1696 where he\ncontends that human self-interest and an evil will constitute\nsignificant obstacles to moral improvement (a development likely due\nto his Pietist conversion during the period; cf. Beck 1969: 251;\nAhnert 2006: 27\u201342).\n\nThis ambivalence and return to theology aside, Thomasius\u2019s moral\nposition is a distinctive one. The theory of rational love is based on\nthe fundamental equality of human beings as well as on their ability\nto think and choose independently (of authority). Ultimately,\nThomasius\u2019s ethics is a social ethics. The theory is\nother-directed, and given the absence of laws and principles,\nconstitutes a contrast to the formalist universalist ethics Kant would\ndevelop by the end of the next century. At the same time, the lack of\nany way of making this theory applicable in a context governed not by\nsimilar but instead by conflicting interests, makes something like a\nformalist ethics an inevitability. By the end of the Introduction\nto Moral Theory, even Thomasius recognizes that \u201crational\nlove\u201d will function only in relatively harmonious contexts. In\nother contexts, however, particularly those characterized by unequal\npower positions, justice may well be required, a distinction in duties\nwhich Thomasius influentially characterizes in terms of\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d obligation (cf.\nBarnard 1988; Schneewind 1998: 165\u2013166).\n",
