This question is central in moral\nepistemology and marks a cluster of problems. The most important are\nthe following.\n\nSociological: The best explanation of the depth of moral\ndisagreements and the social diversity that they reflect is one of two\nthings. (a) No moral facts exist to be known, since moral disagreements\nexemplify merely clashes in moral sensibility rather than differences\nabout matters of fact. (b) Moral knowledge exists, but moral facts are\nrelative to the social group in which moral sensibility is formed with\nthe result that no moral truths are known to hold universally.\nPsychological: Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.\nJudgments about matters of fact, on the other hand, are never\nmotivating just in themselves. Since to constitute moral knowledge a\nmoral judgment must be made about some moral fact, moral knowledge is\nnot possible.\nOntological: Moral knowledge is about moral reality. How is that\nreality constituted? Three general possibilities present themselves.\n(a) Moral reality might be theological in nature, pertaining to (say)\nthe will of God. (b) It might be a non-natural realm that is neither\ntheological nor natural, but sui generis. (c) It might be\ncomprehensible as a part of the natural world studied by science. Each\nof these possibilities, however, is beset with difficulties, and no\nviable fourth alternative has been conceived.\nEvolutionary: Where do human morals come from? A familiar and\nwidely accepted answer is that human morals are in essence, despite\ntheir modern variations, Darwinian adaptations. As such morals are\nabout survival and reproduction and have nothing to do with moral\ntruth. Moreover, while the intuitive, emotional basis of moral\njudgments was useful to our ancestors, this basis is out-dated and\nunreliable in modern industrial society and thus current moral thought\nin such society, which inevitably embeds this basis, is without\nrational foundation.\nMethodological: Traditionally philosophers have sought to explain\nthe possibility of knowledge by appeal to at least some principles\nthat can be grasped and defended a priori and thus independently of\nnatural science. A new and revolutionary epistemology introduced by\nQuine seeks to explain the possibility of knowledge through science\nitself.  \u201cNaturalized epistemology\u201d has been immensely\npopular since its inception in the 1960s, largely because it promises\nto make epistemology consistent with a scientific world-view. At the\nsame time the new methodology appears to make it more difficult to\nexplain the possibility of moral knowledge. Two allied methodologies\nthat seek to find moral truth in a reflective equilibrium of judgments\nor in applications of rational choice theory are much less restrictive\nbut open to the objection that they are morally conservative. A recent\nmethodology allied to naturalized epistemology is pragmatic\nnaturalism. Taking its inspiration from examples of transforming the\nmoral status quo, it is less vulnerable to the charge of moral\nconservatism. However, by understanding moral knowledge as mainly a\nmatter of knowing how to live well interdependently with others by\nresolving issues collectively as they arise, this methodology may not\noffer a conception of moral truth appropriate to genuine moral\nknowledge.\nMoral: Feminists among others are often critical of traditional\nepistemologies as well as the innovative recent methodologies on the\nmoral ground that the standards found there are unjustly biased\nagainst women and other marginalized groups. For example, feminists\noften reject the standard of impartiality contained in these forms of\nepistemology because it renders invisible important knowledge\npossessed by women and thereby contributes to their oppression. If,\nfor reasons to be given, the criticism has merit, then it presents an\napparent paradox within feminist moral epistemology, since it appears\nto reject the ideal of impartiality on the ground that it is not\nitself impartial. The Marxist complaint that the standard of\nimpartiality is unjustly biased against the working class because it\nrenders invisible their exploitation gives rise to the same\ncontradiction. Resolution of the paradox is important for both\nevaluating such criticisms and understanding in general how to\nevaluate moral criticisms of epistemic standards. \n\n\nArguably, these issues, as central and broad as they are, do not cover\nall of moral epistemology. To keep the subject manageable, this entry\nis limited in the following five ways.\n\n\nFirst, the entry ignores global skepticism, which doubts the\npossibility of anyone\u2019s having any knowledge at all. Thus, it ignores\nthe threat of an unstoppable regress in justifications and Cartesian\nevil demon scenarios. Nor does it take up the debates between\nfoundationalists and coherentists about the structure of\njustification. These issues (with an exception to be noted) do not\nraise problems special to moral epistemology. But see the entry for\nMoral Skepticism.\n\n\nSecond, in keeping with the last restriction, the entry takes for granted\nthat our capacity to have other kinds of knowledge is not in question.\nIndeed, the six problems above arise in part because of the\nimplications of having other kinds of knowledge.\n\n\nThird, the entry assumes that moral knowledge entails (roughly)\njustified true moral belief. This assumption commits me to the\nposition that moral knowledge is incompatible with non-cognitivism\n(the view that moral claims lack cognitive value, such as\ntruth-value). A non-cognitivist, however, may seek to explain how the\nattitudes or prescriptions expressed in moral claims are\njustified. (See Hare 1981, Campbell 1985, Gibbard 1990, and Blackburn\n1998 for theories of moral justification compatible with\nnon-cognitivism and the entry on\n moral skepticism\n for a discussion of moral justification in general.) Indeed, an\nexpressivist may invoke a deflationary conception of truth to support\nthe idea that we can speak of justified moral beliefs that are \u201ctrue\u201d\n\u2014 without implying that justified moral beliefs accurately\nrepresent moral reality. Moral justification is discussed below,\nhowever, only as it pertains to putatively reliable representations of\nmoral reality.\n\n\nFourth, many important epistemological issues arise in the context of\nconsidering specific normative theories or types of normative\ntheory. (Can virtue ethics explain how we can know what course of\naction is morally acceptable for a situation demanding the exercise of\nconflicting virtues?) The focus in this entry is on issues that are\nspecial to moral epistemology but not tied to a particular type of\nnormative theory. The feminist criticism cited, though it arises from\nspecific normative concerns, is no exception, since it raises general\nworries about how moral knowledge is possible.\n\n\nFifth, the discussion of the history of moral epistemology is limited\nto philosophers, such as Kant and Hume, who have had the most to say\nabout these issues and whose responses have been most\ninfluential. Other historical positions and additional analysis of the\npossibility of a priori moral knowledge will be covered in other SEP\nentries.\n\n\nMy plan is to examine in turn each of the six clusters of challenges\nto the possibility of moral knowledge in Sections 1\u20136 and then, in\nSections 7\u201310, to reflect on the underlying assumption that moral\nknowledge consists in the justified true moral belief of a single\nindividual.\n\n", "toc": [{"#SocMorDisSocDiv": "1.

Sociological: Moral Disagreement and Social Diversity\n\n\nPeople disagree about all kinds of things, from whether any milk is\nleft in the refrigerator to whether there is global warming. Some of\nthese disagreements are easily settled; others take a long time, even a\nhundred years or more, to reach resolution. Moral disagreement is no\nexception. That disagreement exists regarding moral questions is a\nsociological fact that is beyond question. Moral disagreements,\nhowever, appear to be particularly recalcitrant to resolution. Take the\nmorality of euthanasia or that of capital punishment. Each has been a\nsubject of moral disagreement for a long time. Moreover, it appears that people often\ndisagree even when they agree on non-moral facts. People can, for\nexample, disagree about whether capital punishment is ever morally\njustified, even when they agree that it has no general deterrence\nvalue, because one party believes it is a punishment that \u201cfits\u201d\ncertain crimes, no matter what its other consequences may be.\n\n\nIt would be a mistake to exaggerate the extent of moral\ndisagreement. There is considerable psychological and anthropological\nevidence that a small number of core moral values are espoused\nuniversally, such as: benevolence (avoiding harm to others and\noffering aid when the costs are not high); fairness (reciprocating\nhelp and sharing goods); loyalty (especially to family and community);\nrespect for authority (of one\u2019s parents and community leaders, when it\nis exercised responsibly); personal purity in body and mind (notably\nas it reflects moral character); and freedom (especially from\noppressive control by others). See Haidt 2012; Haidt & Joseph\n2004. Thus, when there is no conflict in moral values, as in Peter\nSinger\u2019s famous example of rescuing a toddler from drowning in a\nshallow pond by wading into it and ruining one\u2019s new suit, there is\nuniversal agreement about what a person ought to do across all\ncultures (Singer 1972).\n\n\nNevertheless, these values are often interpreted and applied\ndifferently not only across cultures but also across time within\nroughly the same cultures. For instance, until recently the dominant\nview in the United States and Europe has been that homosexuality is a\nmorally impure state but now the dominant view is that gay sex is not\ninherently morally impure or unacceptable. What accounts for this\nchange? Moreover, the core moral values can conflict, as when loyalty\nto family or religious authority demands that one not show benevolence\ntoward a despised outsider. What if the toddler to be rescued is from\nthe wrong tribe? Or take the extreme divide separating the politically\nleft and right over issues of freedom and fairness. Though each side\nespouses the core values listed, they interpret them differently and\ngive them different priorities in cases of moral conflict. It is far\nfrom clear how these kinds of moral disputes can ever be resolved.\n\n\nThese considerations lead to the following worry. If it is a\nsociological fact that moral disagreements are generally more\nrecalcitrant to resolution than disputes which do not involve\ndifferences about moral value \u2014 as I will assume for the sake of\nargument \u2014 what explains this fact? A possible explanation is that\nthere is no fact of the matter about whether the practice in question\nis morally right. People agree or disagree in their moral attitudes,\nbut there are no moral truths about which they can be mistaken. Hence,\nnothing about which they have conflicting attitudes is or can be a\nproper object of knowledge. In short, moral disagreements often resist\nresolution, however intelligent, informed, and respectful the\ndisputants may be, because moral knowledge is impossible.\n\n\nThe style of argument here is that of inference to the best\nexplanation (Harman 1965). Even if the sociological premise is granted,\nthe conclusion is not guaranteed to be true. Rather we have reason to\nbelieve the conclusion, assuming the premise is true, provided that no\nother explanation better accounts for the truth of the premise. This\nstyle of argument can be successful when no other explanation can\naccount for the truth of the premise. It may seem, however, that there\nare plausible alternative explanations that are compatible with the\npossibility of moral knowledge. Two main kinds of explanation are\nparticularly salient.\n\n\nOne explanation arises from cases of moral disagreement where the\nprospects of resolution appear most remote. When the disputants are\nfrom different cultures and their disagreement reflects a divergence in\nvalues between the cultures in which the disputants were raised, there\nmay appear to be insufficient common ground on which to effect a\nresolution. A moral relativist can explain this commonplace observation\nwith a theory of moral knowledge. A moral relativist can say that the\nlack of resolution is to be explained by the fact that the moral\nknowledge expressed by each disputant is relative to the culture in\nwhich the person learned his or her values. Thus, when someone from a\nculture in which women must veil their faces in public defends this\npractice as morally appropriate and indeed required, the relativist\nwould interpret the defense as expressing knowledge of what is\nacceptable and not acceptable in his or her culture. Similarly, when\nthe person coming from a culture in which the practice is not\nappropriate or required disagrees, he or she is simply expressing\nknowledge of what is acceptable morally in his or her culture. Each has\nmoral knowledge, despite the clash in their opinions, but their\nknowledge has to be understood relative to the culture in which the\nknowledge has its roots.\n\n\nThe brief description of moral relativism just given belies the\nimmense variety of forms in which it can be stated. Moral relativism\ncan be formulated to take account of differences in moral outlook\nbetween different people within the same society to explain the\ndifficulty of reaching resolution when the general culture of the\ndisputants is the same. It can also be formulated to avoid reference\nto an overarching non-relative moral claim and to allow criticism of\none\u2019s own culture. (See Harman 1975, 1978, and 1985; Lyons 1976; Wong\n1984; Wiggins 1988; Sayre-McCord 1991; Braybrooke et\nal. 1995; Copp 1995.)  Nevertheless, can any view that makes\nmoral truth relative to culture or personal point of view save the\npossibility of moral knowledge? An objection to relativism made famous\nby G. E. Moore is telling in the present context (Moore 1912). If the\nmeaning of the claims were as described, so that each disputant would\nbe saying something true or possibly true of his or her own culture\n(or point of view), there would be the notable logical consequence\nthat they would not be disagreeing with each other. Rather they would\nbe talking about different things.  Moore takes it to be obvious that\nreal disputants would be disagreeing, since each claim should be taken\nto be the contradictory of the other.  Hence, since relativism implies\nthat no moral disagreement exists in this case, he rejects moral\nrelativism as being unable to account for the fact of moral\ndisagreement.\n\n\nAs a general objection to moral relativism, the objection is\nunsuccessful, since it is possible to formulate moral relativism\nwithout the assumption that moral judgments express true or false\nclaims. Thus, Charles Stevenson, who takes them to be expressions of\nattitude, holds that people can disagree in attitude even if their\nmoral views have no truth-value and cannot be logically inconsistent in\nthe sense that Moore intended (Stevenson 1944 and 1963). The objection\nis successful, however, against the attempt to save the possibility of\nmoral knowledge by interpreting the moral claims as being true or false\nclaims about different cultures or points of view. If each disputant,\nin taking issue with the other, is disagreeing about what is true, then\nthe disputants cannot be making claims about different things and hence\ncannot have knowledge of the kind the moral relativist supposes. If\nthey did, neither could be disagreeing about the truth of the other\u2019s\nmoral claim. In the next section we will return to the position that\nmoral claims are merely expressions of attitude, a position consistent\nwith the fact of moral disagreement. For now we should concede that\nmoral relativism does not offer a satisfactory explanation of how moral\nknowledge is possible in cases of radical moral disagreement between\npeople of different cultures of subcultures.\n\n\nIs there another way we might explain the fact of moral disagreement\nwithout conceding the impossibility of moral knowledge? Any theory\nthat implies that moral knowledge is possible must face this question,\nbut in general a range of considerations is available that might\nprovide an alternative explanation depending on the nature of the\ndisagreement.  They divide into three kinds: (a) disagreements about\nnon-moral facts, (b) factors that distort judgment, and (c)\ndisagreements about certain complex empirical facts that are also\nmoral facts. In the first category are disagreements about religious\nfacts, such as whether God exists. We will consider below the\nrelevance of theology to moral epistemology. For the present it is\nsufficient to note that people with deep moral disagreements, say\nregarding abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment, may have\ndifferent religious views. To the extent that these can be considered\nnon-moral views, for example, that God\u2019s will is unambiguously\nexpressed in the Bible, these differences may be able to explain the\nmoral disagreement. Moreover, if it is possible to know whether these\nnon-moral views are true, then we may be able explain moral\ndisagreement without conceding the impossibility of moral\nknowledge. Other kinds of disagreements also fall into category (a).\nPeople with different moral outlooks frequently disagree about the\npsychological nature of humans and other animals or about large-scale\neconomic and social theories relevant to assessing the consequences of\neconomic and social policy. Disagreements about these difficult\nnon-moral questions, assuming that these are issues about which\nobjective knowledge is possible, could explain the absence of moral\nagreement. Unless these explanations can be eliminated, the inference\nfrom persistent moral disagreement to the impossibility of moral\nknowledge is on shaky ground. In category (b) we can place such things\nas having personal bias because of the implications of the issue at\nhand, being in the grip of a social ideology, and feeling abnormally\ndepressed or fearful. A person, for example, who faces the death\npenalty for a crime, or someone who has strong feelings of vengeance,\nmay not be able to form an objective view of the morality of capital\npunishment. Again we have a possible alternative way to explain moral\ndisagreement. Finally, in category (c), if moral facts are extremely\ncomplex empirical facts (see the discussion of moral naturalism\nbelow), it is possible for moral disagreement to persist for the same\nreason that disagreement over complex scientific questions can\npersist.(For further discussion regarding moral disagreement see\nMiller 1992. For recent empirical work suggesting that moral\ndisagreement cannot be explained away by one of the above means, see\nDoris and Plakias 2008.)\n\n\nAlthough the possibility of these alternative explanations does not\nestablish that moral knowledge is possible, anyone arguing to the\nopposite conclusion by inference to the best explanation needs to make\na plausible case that they can all be eliminated. Moreover, as\ndefenders of moral knowledge point out, unless such a case is made out,\nthe default position should be that we know some moral truths.\nDefenders note that moral language is formulated as if moral claims can\nbe true and that we worry about whether to believe certain moral claims\njust as if truth is at stake. When challenged we appeal to evidence\njust as we do in the instance of straightforwardly factual claims, and\nwe make logical inferences that conform to logical systems based on\nclaims having truth-values. Though these points are not decisive, they\nunderline the importance of eliminating alternative explanations of\nmoral disagreement before concluding that moral knowledge is\nimpossible.\n2. Psychological: Moral Motivation\n\n\nAn argument of David Hume provides a more direct threat to the\npossibility of moral knowledge based on the fact that morals excite\nour passions and motivate us to act. If morals are based on reason so\nthat they consist in true or false ideas, they would have to be in\nthemselves incapable of having this direct influence on our actions\n(Hume, Treatise, Book III, Part I, Section I, Paragraph 6.)\nAs he famously said, it is not contrary to reason to prefer the\ndestruction of the whole world to the scratching of a finger (Book II,\nPart III, Section III, Paragraph 6). The argument can be rendered for\nour purposes as a valid deductive argument from three premises: (1) If\nmoral knowledge is possible, then some moral judgments are\nbeliefs. (2) Our moral judgments by themselves necessarily give us\nsome motivation to act, even without the accompaniment of already\nexisting desires. (3) A belief by itself, unaided by already existing\ndesires, can never give us any motivation to act. Therefore, moral\njudgments are not beliefs. Therefore, moral knowledge is\nimpossible. Since the argument is manifestly valid in form, we need to\nexamine the premises to see if we should be persuaded.\n\n\nPremise (1) appears to follow directly from the nature of knowledge.\nIf one knows that something is the case, then one must have some belief\nor judgment about it and what one believes must truly be the case. If\none doesn\u2019t have any opinion about it or if one\u2019s opinion about it is\nnot true, then one doesn\u2019t know it. To say this much, of course, is not\nto say that true opinion is sufficient for knowledge, but that one\u2019s\njudgment is true has seemed to many philosophers to be a minimally\nnecessary condition for knowledge. Premise (2) states what many take to\nbe a minimally necessary condition for something to be a moral\njudgment. If one claims that something is morally wrong, for example,\nbut one feels no disinclination to do it or to persuade others not to\ndo it, then either one is being insincere or else one is not really\nmaking a moral claim. Notice that the premise does not imply that one\nmust act in accordance with the motivation felt. One can be overcome by\ntemptation or fear or have some other counterbalancing motivation that\nleads one not to act in accordance with one\u2019s moral claim. The premise\nsays only that some motivation to act must exist. This view, called\n\u201cinternalism\u201d, entails that it is a logical or conceptual truth that\nsome degree of motivation is internal to the moral judgment itself.\nFinally, premise (3), sometimes called \u201cHume\u2019s dictum\u201d, is the view\nthat judgments of fact, apart from desires that might accompany them,\ndo not move us in any way. This view follows from the widely held\nunderstanding of motivation as consisting of two kinds of mental state:\nbelief and desire (Davidson 1963 and 2001). Without a belief to guide\nit, desire is blind. A desire for food will, for example, not move one\nto eat unless one has identified something that one believes is food.\nOn the other hand, believing that food is before one won\u2019t move one to\neat, even in the slightest, if one has no desire at all to eat. In sum,\neach premise has at least an initial plausibility. In fact, however,\nthe literature contains objections to each one. Let us turn to the\nobjections, taking the premises in reverse order.\n\n\nThose who attack the third premise (but accept the other two premises)\nsee moral judgments as having the cognitive content of a true or false\njudgment of fact and still being able to motivate the persons making\nthe judgment, independently of their antecedent desires. To judge an\naction to be morally wrong, on their view, is to form a true (or\nfalse) belief about a (supposed) moral fact. It is also to be\nmotivated to some degree to act on the basis of this judgment, not\nbecause of some antecedent desire, but just because of the belief that\nthe action is wrong. Those who take this position sometimes allow that\nmotivation involves desire (for example, not to do the act). Thus they\ncan accept the general view of motivation as involving both belief and\ndesire, but they hold that the desire in this case arises purely from\nthe belief that the act is wrong. It is the moral belief itself that\naccounts for the desire\u2014and hence the motivation\u2014without\nthe support of any desire that is already existing. They would claim,\nmoreover, that this picture comports well with the way moral demands\nare perceived. We see something is wrong, even though we may have\nwanted to do it before this point, and then we find ourselves wanting\nnot to do it because we see it as wrong. (See, for example, McNaughton\n1988, Dancy 1993, Smith 1994, Little 1997.)\n\n\nPremise (3) may not be so easily refuted. It derives support not just\nfrom the view that motivation requires both belief and desire, but\nalso from a basic distinction made by Elizabeth Anscombe about the\ndifferent tasks performed by the states of belief and desire. Anscombe\nasks us to think of a list of groceries that might serve either as an\ninventory of the food in a grocery store or as a shopping list\n(Anscombe 1963). In the first case it merely describes, truly or\nfalsely, what is in the store. If it is a good inventory, the list\nconforms to the items of food in the store. In the second case the\nlist remains a good shopping list even if the items are not in the\nshop; in this case it is the store, not the list, that needs to\nchange. Beliefs are like inventories; desires are like shopping\nlists. They have different and opposite \u201cdirection of fit.\u201d We want\nour beliefs to fit the world and to change when they don\u2019t. But we\nwant the world to fit our desires and to change when it doesn\u2019t. In\nlight of this distinction, it may seem that to reject premise (3) for\nthe reasons given is to suppose that moral judgments necessarily have\nboth directions of fit simultaneously. Is this view of moral judgment\ncoherent? In the case of lack of fit between the moral judgment and\nthe moral facts, the view seems to imply that the moral judgment\nshould change and not change. (For more on direction of fit, see Smith\n1987 and Copp and Sobel 2001.)\n\n\nThe matter does not rest here, however. The critic of premise (3) can\npoint out that moral beliefs are unlike grocery inventories, since the\npart of the world that they are designed to fit is the part that tells\nus how we ought to be morally, rather than the part that tells how we\nare non-morally. Therefore, the moral reality that a moral judgment is\ndesigned to fit is distinct from the non-moral part of the world (our\nbehavior) that may need to change in order to fit the moral\njudgment. Both directions of fit apply, in other words, but they\nrelate moral beliefs to different parts or aspects of reality, moral\nin one case and non-moral in the other. Contradiction is thus avoided.\nNevertheless, if moral judgments have both directions of fit in the\nmanner suggested, then there must be moral facts that are inherently\nprescriptive, demanding that we change ourselves to conform to them.\nSuch facts would be ontologically strange, as John Mackie has noted,\nvery unlike anything studied in science (Mackie 1977). The critic of\npremise (3) may, however, be prepared to live with this result. (We\nwill take up this ontological issue in the next section.) What may be\nmore difficult to live with is rejection of recent results in\nneuroscience. Timothy Schroeder (2004) argues that, except for its\ncontent, moral motivation is not different in its neurobiological\nbasis from other kinds of deliberative motivation. In particular,\nmoral representations of right and wrong move us through projections\non the orbitofrontal cortex in the same way that representations of\nfavorite foods move us. That is, they do not move us directly through\nprojections on our motor centers independently of our desire for the\nthings represented (as is the case with behavioral tics).\n\n\nLet us turn now to premise (2). A critic of internalism can allow\nthat moral beliefs are normally associated with some desire to conform\nto them but would deny that the link between belief and desire in such\ncases is anything more than contingent. To take a simple example to\nconvey the general idea, imagine a utilitarian interpretation of the\ncontent of moral judgments. Suppose, that is, that to judge that an act\nis wrong is to imply that the act leads to a lower net balance of\nhappiness over unhappiness (summed over everyone affected) than some\nalternative act would. It is possible from an externalist perspective\nto judge an act wrong but feel no disinclination to perform it. This\nresult might obtain even if the act leads to horrible suffering on the\npart of everyone else and the person who makes the judgment is fully\naware of this fact and of the content of the judgment. Such cases are\nadmittedly pathological, but the point is that they are at least\nlogically possible contrary to premise (2). Normally, people aren\u2019t\nlike that. In fact, an externalist can argue that most people are\nsocialized so that they have some feeling for the feelings of others.\nFor this reason they will feel some motivation to act in accord with\ntheir moral judgments on a utilitarian interpretation of their content.\nThe connection between the content of the judgment and the motivation,\nhowever, is external, in the sense that the connection is mediated by\nthe contingent fact that people are normally socialized to care to some\ndegree about others (Brink 1989).\n\n\nThe internalists can make at least two kinds of reply. First of all,\nwhile they will concede the existence of people who feel no motivation\nto do what they say they \u201cought\u201d to do, they can deny that these people\nhave made genuine moral judgments. There is a manner of speaking in\nwhich we can say that something is wrong but mean only that this is\nwhat is considered wrong around here or in the culture under\ndiscussion. The trouble is that disputes over whether the examples in\nquestion are cases of genuine moral judgment can easily degenerate into\nexercises in stipulative definition and the trading of intuitions\ntutored by divergent theories. It is moot whether anything can settle\nthis matter (Fenske 1997). A more promising line of reply is to point\nout that the externalist\u2019s theory of moral motivation does not sit\ncomfortably with the way we learn to receive moral criticism and make\nmoral judgments. From an early age we learn to respond to moral\njudgments made by our elders and to form them ourselves through\nlearning how to respond emotionally to various morally important\nsituations. We learn to feel badly about types of things judged by\nothers to be wrong, like being unkind or dishonest, and then express\nnegative attitudes toward these things when we make moral judgments\nourselves. In these cases it would appear that the disinclination to do\nwhat is wrong and the inclination to discourage others from doing it\nare not mediated by an appreciation of the abstract content of the\njudgment and its bearing on things that we independently find\ndispleasing. The tie between moral judgment and motivation appears to\nbe direct, much like that suggested by the internalist.\n\n\nWe can see another way to view this problem by moving to an\nassessment of premise (1). This premise presupposes that if someone has\nmoral knowledge, then this person makes a moral judgment the content of\nwhich is a true proposition. It appears, then, that the premise presupposes\nthat the moral judgment in such cases is a moral belief rather than a\ndesire or an emotion or something else that cannot be literally true.\nThis position has indeed been the view of the internalists who reject\npremise (3) but accept premises (1) and (2). They agree that the moral\njudgment leads directly to a desire, but they maintain that it is in\nits content simply a belief. Should the critics of this argument accept\nthis presupposition? Here is an important reason to question it.\n\n\nWe can view \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d as distinct\nfunctional descriptions that tell us how mental states falling under\none label or the other work in interaction with other mental states\nand issue in behavior. The previous talk of directions of fit can be\ntaken to illustrate these distinct functions. We might then think of a\nmoral judgment as a complex mental state that normally exemplifies\nboth functions (Campbell 1998 and 2007). Moral judgment might be\nthought of as a natural kind in which the two functions comprise a\nhomeostatic unity (Kumar 2015). In its primitive form moral judgment\nmight have functioned simply to motivate conformity to norms learned\nin early socialization, accounting for the apparent direct association\nof moral judgments with motivation. It might later have evolved to\ntake on higher cognitive functions that incline many people to think\nof it as a moral belief. On this view it is normally both, contrary to\nthe presupposition that moral judgments are essentially beliefs. As\nsuch, moral judgments would not be disbarred from exemplifying moral\nknowledge. At the same time the position would not run afoul of Hume\u2019s\ndictum. In fact, it would be a kind of externalism, allowing that in\nabnormal cases one function or the other would not be present. For\nexample, if one is raised to believe that gay sex is wrong, one may at\nfirst continue to feel one\u2019s former emotions and motivations in this\nregard even after forming the considered belief that gay sex is not\nwrong. Or one may judge something not to be wrong but feel deep\nresentment or indignation, say when one is a woman who is unfairly\npassed over for a promotion but one does not believe at first that one\nhas been treated unfairly. In this case one\u2019s emotional and\nmotivational response, if it is sustained and leads one to form a new\nbelief, that one has been treated unfairly, may constitute a negative\nmoral judgment, even before the change in belief. (We return to this\nexample in 4.3 below.) Although these few remarks hardly demonstrate\nthe viability of this hybrid view, anyone defending premise (1) on the\nassumption that moral judgments are essentially beliefs needs to\nconsider this alternative and rule it out.\n\n The hybrid conception of moral judgment is not inconsistent with\npremise (1), if we are prepared to interpret it as implying only that\nfor moral knowledge to be possible moral judgments are sometimes\n(true) beliefs, not that they are always nothing but beliefs. Recall\npremise (1): If moral knowledge is possible, then our moral judgments\nare beliefs. If moral judgments are normally combinations of belief,\nemotion, and motivation, but are sometimes just beliefs and sometimes\njust emotional and motivational responses, then it is possible to\naccept premises (1), (2), and (3) and the possibility of moral\nknowledge. The reason is that one can accept that moral judgments can\nbe true, without either denying that moral judgments normally motivate\ndirectly or implying that moral beliefs sometimes motivate directly\nindependently of antecedent desires. This hybrid conception must be\ndistinguished from internalist theories that construe moral judgments\nas \u201cbesires\u201d (things that are necessarily beliefs and desires\u2014see\nAltham 1987). Unlike these theories the above hybrid conception allows\nthese elements to separate, as in the examples of changing one\u2019s moral\njudgment about gay sex or a failed promotion. It must also be\ndistinguished from theories that allow that moral judgments have both\nfunctions but give priority to either the belief side (Copp 2001) or\nthe expressive side (Ridge 2006). The first variety would deny that\nresponses that are emotional and motivational but are not beliefs\ncould be moral judgments, however moral in character those responses\nmight be. The second would deny that responses that are only beliefs\ncould be moral judgments in themselves. Which hybrid theory of moral\njudgment is preferable, if any, is a matter of controversy.\n3. Ontological: Moral Facts and Moral Naturalism\n\n\nThe most direct challenge to moral knowledge is to question whether\nanything exists that could possibly serve as a suitable object of such\nknowledge. If no\nconception of what moral reality would have to be like fits our\nunderstanding of the kinds of things that exist, then moral knowledge\nis not possible. In\ngeneral, the candidates for possible objects of moral knowledge divide\ninto three categories: natural (objects that are knowable only through\nexperience), non-natural (but not supernatural), and theological (or\nsupernatural). We will assess reasons for thinking that none of these\ncategories provide suitable objects of moral knowledge, treating them\nin reverse order.\n3.1 Theological Facts\n\n\nAn ancient view still popular today is that moral knowledge must\nultimately be based on the will or commandments of the Creator. This\nview faces two major problems. First, there is the obvious difficulty\nthat skepticism about God\u2019s existence is at least as difficult to lay\nto rest as skepticism about moral knowledge. Since arguments for and\nagainst the existence of God are assessed elsewhere in this\nEncyclopedia, I will not stop to rehearse them here. Second,\nthere is the further difficulty that even if we are confident about\nGod\u2019s existence, it is not clear how we can interpret the will or\ncommandments of God without first having moral knowledge, thus making\nthis reply to the skeptic question-begging.\n\n\nThe latter problem arises from a dilemma posed in Plato\u2019s\nEuthyphro. In this dialogue Euthyphro tries to explain to\nSocrates that piety is what the gods love. Socrates then asks Euthyphro\nwhether the gods love the pious because they are good or whether the\npious are good because the gods love them. To put the dilemma in terms\nrelevant to the present context, consider the view that genocide is\nwrong because it is contrary to God\u2019s will. (The argument doesn\u2019t\nchange if we talk about commandments or love instead of will.) We can\nask of this view whether God forbids genocide because it is wrong, or\nwhether it is wrong because God forbids it. In the latter case God\u2019s\nwill appears to be arbitrary or at least not based on an appropriate\nmoral reason. For believers who regard God as supremely moral, the\nlatter possibility would be unacceptable. In the former case, however,\nGod\u2019s will would be based on the wrongness of genocide, conceived as\nbeing separate from and logically prior to the concept of God\u2019s will.\nHence, in this case the appeal to God\u2019s will does not provide an answer\nto the skeptic, but rather presupposes that we already have an answer.\nIn sum, unless we are prepared to suppose that what God wills, loves,\nor commands has no moral basis, the attempt to base the possibility of\nmoral knowledge on knowledge of God\u2019s will or love or commandments is,\nlike Euthyphro\u2019s explanation of piety, viciously circular. (For\ndiscussion of other versions of the objection, see Chandler 1984 and\nWestmoreland 1996. Also see the entry on\n theological voluntarism.)\n3.2 Non-natural Facts\n\n\nOne might suppose that the obvious alternative is to think of moral\nreality as embedded in the natural world as opposed to the\nsupernatural. However, for reasons that we will turn to shortly, many\nphilosophers have strongly resisted this option and have proposed that\nmoral knowledge has its basis in non-natural aspects of the world that\ncan be apprehended only through a faculty of moral intuition or reason\nthat is independent of sense experience. Moral reality, so conceived,\nis posited as sui generis, reducible to neither the natural nor the\nsupernatural and requiring a mode of apprehension comparable to\nmathematical intuition.\n\n\nAn immense variety of views fall within this category. At one extreme\nis the idea that we can apprehend a priori a general principle from\nwhich we can derive particular moral claims using non-moral facts as\nminor premises. According to Henry Sidgwick (Sidgwick, The Methods\nof Ethics, 1907), we know a priori several self-evident axioms\nthat are objectively true, including axioms of benevolence and\njustice, and that lead together to the conclusion that each of us\nought to do what will bring about the best consequences when their\nvalue is known by the ratio of pleasure over pain in them viewed\nimpartially. (See de Lazari-Radek & Singer, 2014, for an\nup-to-date exposition and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s famous work in light\nof current issues in moral philosophy and Sidgwick\u2019s struggle to do\njustice to Egoism.) Sidgwick\u2019s ethical theory, a form of\nutilitarianism, contrasts with Kant\u2019s deontological theory, according\nto which we know, again a priori, that we ought to treat each person\nas an end, never merely as a means (Kant, Groundwork of the\nMetaphysic of Morals, 1785). Both imply specific moral\nconclusions, such as that a given promise ought to be kept, once we\nunderstand what is involved in breaking and keeping the promise,\neither regarding their consequences (Sidgwick) or regarding what is\nentailed in the will to do either act (Kant). The important point is\nthat the derivations depend on assuming as a premise something that\ncan be known only a priori. \n\n\nAt the other extreme are forms of moral particularism, according to\nwhich one directly intuits the moral rightness or wrongness of an act\nonce one has understood its particular natural features (see the entry\non\n moral particularism).\n As in\nthe previous case it is necessary to comprehend the non-moral features\nof the situation before a specific moral judgment can be made and known\nto be true. In making this judgment, however, one must rely not merely\non knowledge of these non-moral features but on one\u2019s ability to intuit\nthe moral significance of these features. The difference between the\ncases is only that in the first we appeal to a general principle, while\nin the second we intuit the moral truth directly. In both, moral\nintuition is essential to arriving at moral knowledge. W. D. Ross\nprovides an example of a mixed form of moral intuitionism (Ross 1930).\nOn his theory we have an intuitive grasp of principles that tell us\nwhat we ought to do \u201cother things being equal\u201d (e.g., one ought to be\nkind, other things being equal). Then we must use moral intuition again\nto decide in a given case, which may involve conflicting principles,\nwhat action we ought to perform, all things considered.\n\n\nOne concern about all forms of moral intuitionism is the fact that\npeople can continue to disagree about the moral facts when they appear\nto agree on the non-moral facts. If we all possess the same faculty of\nmoral intuition, should such disagreement be possible at all? But the\nmoral intuitionist can counter this objection in the way suggested\nearlier when we considered the argument against the possibility of\nmoral knowledge based on disagreement. There are too many other\nfactors that may explain disagreement without giving up the assumption\nthat we share a faculty of moral intuition. Another concern is that we\nlearn what is right and wrong initially from examples and advice of\nour elders. Isn\u2019t this fact about moral development inconsistent with\nthe idea that morals are based ultimately on a priori intuition? It\nappears not. We begin to learn mathematics in a similar way, using\nconcrete examples and relying on authority. Then, as we develop\nunderstanding, we are eventually able to grasp relevant truths, such\nas that 2 + 2 = 4, in a way that is not dependent on the vagaries of\nexperience. If we put two oranges in a hat and then add two more and\nsubsequently find five there, we assume an extra one was there to\nbegin with or that it is a trick hat or that the oranges can\nmysteriously reproduce themselves. We don\u2019t doubt that 2 + 2 =\n4. Similarly, it may be argued, once we grasp the wrongness of\ntreating another person merely as a means, finding many examples of\nthis treatment or many people who think the treatment is right won\u2019t\nin the least alter, or even seem relevant to, our perception of its\nwrongness. (See, however, Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, and the reply by\nShafer-Landau 1988.)\n\n\nA less superficial objection is that it is possible to explain both\nthe origin and usefulness of our moral perceptions without supposing\nthat any non-natural moral realm exists as an object of moral\nknowledge. This objection is similar to the last in that it emphasizes\nour dependence on examples and authority in acquiring moral perceptions\nthat are stable once the relevant non-moral facts are at hand, but the\nclaim is not that this dependence is inconsistent with the existence of\na non-natural moral reality. Rather the claim is that postulating the\nlatter reality is unnecessary to comprehending all the facts about\nmoral development and the social usefulness of moral codes. We don\u2019t\nneed to assume such a reality in order to explain all that is beyond\ndoubt and hence don\u2019t need to postulate a faculty of moral intuition of\nany of the kinds just canvassed. Moral intuition and the moral\nknowledge it is presumed to make possible are redundant hypotheses that\nwe can safely discard. It is largely this dismissal of moral\nintuitionism that has given rise in the second half of the last century\nto moral naturalism as the dominant moral theory among those who\ncontinue to believe that moral knowledge is possible. (For further\ndiscussion see the entry on\n moral non-naturalism.)\n3.3 Natural Facts\n\n\nMoral naturalism (as a form of cognitivism) maintains that, while a\ndistinction can be drawn between moral facts and other kinds of facts,\nmoral facts are among the natural facts of the world. An advantage of\nthis position for explaining the possibility of moral knowledge is that\nnearly everyone who rejects global skepticism grants that knowledge of\nnatural facts is possible. The moral naturalist, therefore, is in a\nposition to argue that moral knowledge should not be more problematic\nthan other kinds of knowledge of the natural world. A moral naturalist\ncan, moreover, reply to the charge that moral facts are redundant for\nexplaining the facts of the natural world by pointing out that the\nburden of proof is on the critic to demonstrate that those natural\nfacts that are also moral facts have no explanatory power. Certainly\nthey cannot be said to lack explanatory power for the reason that they\nare not part of the natural world. Nor can they be said to be\ninaccessible to empirical study, since as part of the natural world\nthey are knowable through experience (Copp 1995, p. 27).\n3.3.1 Identity, supervenience, and redundancy\n\n\nIt is important, however, to distinguish in this regard between two\ndifferent kinds of moral naturalism. One kind maintains that moral\nproperties are identical with certain natural properties specified by\ncombinations of non-moral terms found in the natural and social\nsciences (Brandt 1979, Railton 1986, Copp 1995). To take an\noversimplified example, suppose that the property of being a wrong act\nis identical with the property of having as a consequence a lower\nquotient of pleasure over pain for all affected by the act than an\nalternative act would. Here a moral property of being a wrong act is\nheld to be one and the same property as a complex utilitarian property\nspecified in the non-moral terms of consequence, pleasure, and pain.\nGiven this identity, an act having this moral property cannot be less\nopen to empirical study nor can it have less explanatory power than an\nact\u2019s having the property of not maximizing pleasure over pain. For\ninstance, if a group avoids a certain kind of action, the correct\nexplanation, given the identity and the role of pleasure and pain in\nlearning, could be that this kind of act is wrong. Whether it is or not\nwould be an empirical question.\n\n\nThe situation is more complex, however, for the other form of moral\nnaturalism. It maintains that moral facts are natural facts but denies\nthat they are specifiable using the language of the natural and social\nsciences (Kim 1978, Sturgeon 1985, Brink 1989). Moral facts are said to\nbe natural facts in that they are discoverable empirically and provide\ncausal explanations of events in the natural world. At the same time,\nthey are a unique category that defies identification in non-moral\nterms. As such, they raise again the issue of redundancy. Do we really\nneed this special category of natural facts in order to understand the\nnatural world? In this view some natural facts are supposed to\nsupervene on others. That is to say, moral facts are dependent\non distinct natural facts specifiable in non-moral terms in the\nfollowing way: if the moral facts were otherwise, necessarily the\ndistinct non-moral facts on which they depend would have to be\ndifferent. Take a deliberate act of cruelty done just for fun. This act\nis wrong in virtue of being a deliberate act of cruelty done just for\nfun. The fact that it is a wrong act and the fact that it is\ndeliberately cruel done for fun are distinct facts, but the first\ndepends on the second. Necessarily, if what was done had not been wrong,\nit would not have been a deliberate act of cruelty done for fun. Once\nthis relation of supervenience is recognized, it is possible to defend\nthe non-redundancy of moral facts by pointing out parallel relations of\nsupervenience in the non-moral natural world and arguing that the\nredundancy objection proves too much, asking us to reject other\nnon-moral categories that appear ontologically sound. For example,\ngenetic facts obtaining at the cellular level are said to supervene on\ngenetic facts at the molecular level without one being simply identical\nwith the other (Kitcher 1984), yet it would be absurd from a scientific\nperspective to deny the existence of facts at the cellular level.\nWhether this defense is ultimately successful remains to be seen, but\nat the present time it is far from clear that either form of naturalism\ncan be rejected on grounds of redundancy (Sayre-McCord 1988).\n3.3.2 Reasoning from experience?\n\n\nWe began with an objection to moral naturalism that applies as well\nto moral non-naturalism, noting that the former is in a better position\nto meet it. Let us now direct our attention to an important objection\nthat applies specifically to moral naturalism. Kant argues\n(Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Chapter 2, paragraph\nfive) that moral knowledge cannot be based on experience of the natural\nworld. We might interpret one of his arguments as having the following\nstructure. (a) If we have moral knowledge at all, we must know a\ngeneral moral truth from which we can deduce specific conclusions. But\n(b) we could know this general truth on the basis of experience only by\ngeneralizing from examples of right and wrong that we encounter in\nexperience. Consider then, as a specific example, an act of deliberate\ncruelty done for fun. How would we know that this is a wrong act or a\nright act? We must infer it from a general moral truth, according to\n(a), but to explain how we know a general moral truth, we must, given\n(b), experience specific examples of right and wrong, and now we are\nback where we began. To avoid this circle, we must assume that we know\na priori that some act or kind of act is wrong. In general, it follows that\nno moral knowledge is based solely on experience. Moral naturalism\ncannot, therefore, provide an appropriate ontology for moral\nknowledge.\n\n\nKant\u2019s argument is particularly powerful because the assumptions on\nwhich it is built are fairly weak, indeed much weaker than they might\nat first appear to be. At times Kant argues that moral knowledge cannot\nbe based on experience because it requires knowledge of absolutely\nuniversal truths that transcend all earthly experience, but this\nargument does not need that strong assumption. In fact, the argument\nwould work even if (contrary to Kant) the most basic moral principle\nhas many exceptions and is true only some of the time. Arguably we\nwould still need to appeal to examples if we are to learn from\nexperience when the principle applies and when it doesn\u2019t, and then we\nwould need some way to determine the moral status of the examples. But,\nagain, it would be question begging to assume that knowledge of their\nmoral status comes from experience rather than a priori, since the\npossibility of this is what is at issue.\n\n\nThe essence of the argument can be put in more general terms. Both\nforms of moral naturalism entail that facts that are specifiable in\nnon-moral terms determine the moral facts, where the determination\ninvolves either identity or else supervenience without identity. But\nwhich moral facts do they determine? Most philosophers will grant that\nnatural facts (or properties) that are specifiable non-morally can be\nexperienced. The problem is in making the step from the latter kind of\nfact to a moral fact just to establish the moral fact in\neven one example. Appeal to experience, it may seem, cannot completely\naccount for this step without circularity.\n\n\nA difficulty for the argument, however, is that it turns on a narrow\nconception of reasoning from experience. The argument assumes that\nreasoning from experience must begin with clear cases of knowledge, at\nleast regarding the things observed in experience, and then infer more\ngeneral knowledge. This way of thinking about empirical reasoning has\na long tradition and was dominant among empiricist philosophers in the\nfirst half of the twentieth century. In the second half, thinking\nabout reasoning in science changed dramatically. One prominent\nalternative view is that general hypotheses offer explanations of\nexperience, and that we reason from experience by inferring the best\nexplanation of our data against a background of theoretical\nassumptions that are subject to tests on other occasions and in other\ncontexts. Two important differences are that we don\u2019t begin with firm\nknowledge and, second, that we rely on background information to\ndetermine the best explanation. The relevance for moral knowledge is\nclear enough. We can begin with mere moral beliefs and feelings\n(rather than moral knowledge) yet reason to a conclusion implying\nmoral knowledge if the conclusion provides the best explanation of the\nbeliefs and feelings (Sturgeon 1985). Since the starting points are\nnot assumed to be cases of moral knowledge, the problem of circularity\ndoes not arise in the way implied by the above argument. Whether the\nbackground information contains moral knowledge is a further issue (to\nbe taken up in section 5), but nothing in this alternative conception\nof reasoning from experience necessitates that the reasoning assumes\nmoral knowledge. Unless this alternative conception can be eliminated,\nthe Kantian argument is at best inconclusive.\n3.3.3 The naturalistic fallacy and the open question argument\n\n\nThe last suggestion turns on a step in reasoning that moves from\nfacts that can be specified non-morally and are taken on all sides to\nbe open to empirical study to moral facts. This step has been claimed\nby numerous philosophers to be a fallacious step in deductive\nreasoning. Some of these philosophers hold that the moral claims are\nnot true or false and hence cannot express moral knowledge (Ayer 1946,\nStevenson 1944 and 1963, Hare 1952 and 1981, Gibbard 1990, Blackburn\n1984 and1998). Others, such as Kant and G. E. Moore, hold that moral\nknowledge is possible but not deducible from experience of the natural\nworld. Moore\u2019s argument, however, is worth considering in its own\nright, since it has had significant influence since he first\narticulated it in 1903 and differs from Kant\u2019s. For Moore, what would\nhave to be the case to allow the reasoning to go through would be the\nidentity of a moral property with a property specifiable in terms\ndescribing the natural world. For example, if the property of being\nmorally good is the same as the property of being pleasurable, then\nfrom the empirically ascertainable fact that an activity is pleasurable\none can deduce that the activity is morally good. Moore thought,\nhowever, that no naturalistically specifiable property, such as being\npleasurable, could possibly be the same as a moral property. In fact,\nhis position was more general. He called it a \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d to\nsuppose that a moral property is the same as some natural property,\nhowever the latter property might be specified. In his language, moral\nnaturalism, in either to the two forms considered, would be an example\nof the naturalistic fallacy.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is worth noting an important respect in which Moore\u2019s argument\ndiffers from Kant\u2019s. While Kant\u2019s argument is about the nature of\nreasoning to moral conclusions, Moore\u2019s is focused directly on the\nidentity of moral properties, however they might be known. Moore thinks\nthat moral properties are not natural and therefore cannot be known by\nexperience. Kant, reasoning in the reverse, thinks that moral\nproperties cannot be known by experience and hence cannot be natural\nproperties. Since natural properties are known through experience and\nat issue is whether moral properties are natural properties, it is easy\nto miss this critical difference. Whether Moore\u2019s reasons for thinking\nthat moral properties are not natural turn out to be good reasons, he\nsucceeded in focusing the debate on the strictly ontological issue of\nidentity.\n\n\nWhy does Moore think that the identity in question is impossible,\napart from our methods of reasoning? Moore\u2019s answer is his \u201copen\nquestion argument\u201d (Moore, 1903). Moore reasons, if the identity\nillustrated in the last example were to hold, it would be odd to ask,\n\u201cI know this activity is pleasurable, but is it morally\ngood?\u201d After all, if being pleasurable just is the property of\nbeing morally good, then to ask this would be like asking, \u201cI\nknow this activity is pleasurable, but is it pleasurable?\u201d Since\nthe original question is \u201copen,\u201d rather than silly or\nself-answering, the identity must not obtain. Since exactly the same\npoint can be made regarding any putative identity between a moral\nproperty and a natural property, Moore concludes that no such identity\nis possible.\n\n\nThe open question argument has not been persuasive for several\nreasons. Two are especially notable. Moore\u2019s target was the moral\nnaturalist who thought that the identities in question might be\nestablished on the basis of conceptual analysis. It has been pointed\nout, however, that the question might still be open for someone\nprovided that this person is not aware of the identity, not having\ncarried out the analysis (Brandt 1959). Current versions of moral\nnaturalism, moreover, do not propose that the identity would be known\nby a priori reasoning. The identity is conceived instead to be\nanalogous to those identities discovered in the sciences, such as the\nidentity claimed to exist between genes and strings of DNA or the\nwell-accepted identity between water and H2O. Obviously, whether genes\nare DNA or whether water is H2O have been open questions at one time.\nIn the case of DNA the question is still open for some. The reason is\nthat these identities are established a posteriori. Perhaps Moore is\nright to deny the putative identity, but his open question argument\nfails to establish that he is.\n3.3.4 Moral reasoning from the first-person perspective\n\n\nDespite the failure of Moore\u2019s argument, the question of the\nidentity of moral properties with natural properties remains a hotly\ncontested issue. Many believe that if Moore gave the wrong reason for\ndisputing the possibility of these identities, he was still right to\ndraw our attention to the apparent difference between a property that\ndescribes a natural feature of the world and a property that has\nprescriptive or normative significance for us. The latter tells us how\nthings ought to be rather than telling us how things are. How could\nproperties that play such different roles in our reflections about the\nworld be the same?\n\n\nThis question may be interpreted in different ways. We might\nemphasize the immediate relevance of moral properties for our\nmotivation to act, contrasting it with the merely indirect relevance of\nnatural properties. This interpretation, however, would take us back to\nthe debate between internalists and externalists that we have already\nexplored. A quite different interpretation focuses on the perceived\nrole of moral properties in moral reflection and judgment from the\nperspective of someone engaged in moral reflection and judgment. Two\ncases are particularly relevant. Suppose, to take Harman\u2019s example,\nthat I suddenly see hoodlums setting a cat on fire (Harman 1977). I may\nform an immediate judgment, without any conscious reflection, that what\nthey are doing is wrong. In another case I may find myself perplexed\nabout whether euthanasia is wrong and begin to reflect on why I should\nregard it one way or another. Each case presents an apparently strong\ncontrast to the style of thinking that engages me if I were suddenly to\nrecognize the presence of a cat or were to reflect on whether a certain\ncontested property of a natural system really exists. Let us explore\nthese cases in turn.\n\n\nWhen we make an immediate moral judgment that the hoodlums are doing\nwrong, we might be said to be making an inference, however unconscious.\nWe infer from our belief that the hoodlums are engaged in an act of\ncruelty, done for fun, that what they are doing is wrong. Grant for the\nsake of argument that there is an inference here. Clearly it is not an\ninductive inference, such as an inference to the best explanation of\ntheir setting the cat on fire. The judgment that their act is wrong\ndoes not explain what they are doing, nor would we likely say that\ntheir torturing the cat for fun provides empirical evidence that they are doing\nwrong. Our thinking in this case simply does not resemble, at least not\nas seen from the inside, anything like an inductive inference, as the\nidentity thesis of moral naturalism would appear to require. Moreover,\nif someone did not reach the conclusion that the hoodlums were acting\nwrongly, even though she believed that they were torturing the cat for\nfun, we would think her guilty of moral insensitivity. We would not\ncharge her with having made some perceptual error or a mistake in\nreasoning. The latter could be appropriate criticism, however, if she\nwere making an inductive inference based on her perception. The kind of\ncriticism that is appropriate for failing to make the correct judgment\nis different in each case, contrary to what we should expect if the\nidentity thesis is true.\n\n\nThe objections here may not be decisive, however. (See Copp 2000 for\nthe following rebuttal.) The best explanation of how we reason in\njudging the hoodlums to be doing wrong is that we think in general that\nacts of deliberate cruelty done for fun are wrong and subsume this case\nunder that general rule. The moral judgment is the result of a simple\ninference from the fact that the hoodlums are committing such an act.\nFor this reason our thinking contrasts sharply with inductive\nreasoning. We are, in fact, reasoning deductively. It is important to\nnotice, however, that although our reasoning is deductive, nothing says\nthat the premises of our reasoning are not empirical. Similar reasoning\noccurs frequently in science. I may notice a copper wire and\nimmediately infer that it conducts electricity on the basis of my\nknowledge that in general copper is a good conductor of electricity.\nThe main premise is obviously empirical, even though I am reasoning\ndeductively. Such examples are a dime a dozen. The example need not,\ntherefore, force us to the conclusion that non-inductive reasoning in\nthe moral case is different in some basic way. Analogues to moral\nsensitivity exist in cases where people\u2019s interests and training make\nthem sensitive to horticultural, fiscal, and emotional facts. Moral\nsensitivity is a heightened tendency to notice morally relevant\nfeatures of situations. But some people have a heightened awareness of\nplants or financial trends or the emotional states of others. We do not\nwant to conclude that these objects of heightened awareness are not\nnatural features of the world.\n\n\nConsider finally the case where we are puzzling about the morality\nof euthanasia. If we are puzzled, we do not leap to a conclusion.\nInstead we reflect upon similar examples and general moral principles,\ntrying to arrive at a balanced view of the morally relevant features of\nthe case at hand. Perhaps there are analogues to how we would behave\nwhen puzzled about a scientific question. Notice, however, that most\npeople would not engage in the type of investigation that we should\nexpect if moral wrongness were a property that is identical to a\ncomplex natural property whose presence is open to empirical study.\nConsider the following summary account of the natural property that\nCopp takes to be identical to that of being wrong. On his theory to\nclaim that something is wrong is to ascribe to it the property of\nviolating a standard or norm that would be a justified moral standard\nfor the relevant society. \u201cA moral standard is relevantly justified\njust in case (roughly) its currency in the social code of the relevant\nsociety would best contribute to the society\u2019s ability to meet its\nneeds \u2014 including its needs for physical continuity, internal harmony\nand co-operative interaction, and peaceful and co-operative relations\nwith its neighbors.\u201d (Copp 2000, pp. 47\u20138) Surely, when people engage\nin moral reflection to resolve their puzzlement about a moral issue,\nthey do not attempt an empirical study of the kind that would be called\nfor if the puzzlement were about whether this complex natural property\nobtains.\n\n\nThe general objection, it should be stressed, is not limited to\nCopp\u2019s theory. The objection can be put equally forcefully for any of\nthe other prominent theories of moral naturalism. Copp has a rebuttal,\nhowever, that would apply generally for the other naturalistic moral\ntheories that entail an identity of the kind under attack. Consider a\npiece of paper that has the property of being a U.S. dollar bill. To\nstate in the terms of economic theory the truth conditions for a piece\nof paper having this property would be a task beyond the competence of\nmost people. It would involve minimally the dispositions of relevant\nofficials and the rest of the U.S. population to exchange goods and\nservices for the price of one dollar. The task would not end here,\nhowever, since we would need to spell out in empirically testable terms\nwho counts as a relevant official, who counts as part of the U.S.\npopulation, and what it means for something to be \u201cpriced at one\ndollar.\u201d On the other hand, most people would know whether a piece of\npaper is a U.S. one dollar bill and would know it at once just by\ninspection. Moral naturalists can contend, indeed, that most people on\nseeing a U.S. dollar bill would arrive correctly and reliably at the\nconclusion that it is one. Moreover, they would be able do this as\neasily as they would conclude correctly and reliably that the hoodlums\nare doing something horribly wrong on seeing them set a cat on fire\n(Copp 2000).\n\n\nNow imagine that we are puzzled about whether a piece of paper is a\nU.S. one dollar. Perhaps we have heard on the radio that counterfeit\nU.S. one dollar bills have been recently exchanged in our neighborhood.\nWe would try to compare it to bills that have come from elsewhere that\nwe are sure are not counterfeit or perhaps get the advice of an expert.\nWe would likely not, however, appeal to the general theoretical\nidentity mentioned earlier and attempt to verify the authenticity of\nthe bill by reference to it. We should, it can thus be argued, reject\nthe inference that identities of the kind in question do not exist\nbecause we would not appeal to them when we are puzzled about specific\ncases. The non-moral analogue undermines the inference from the case of\neuthanasia. The identities can come into play when foundational issues\nare raised. If the question is whether to devalue the U.S. dollar or\nwhether it should be tied to the gold standard, then the theoretical\nspecification of what constitutes a U.S. dollar may come into play and\nmay be important to explain the force of certain arguments pro or con.\nBut, similarly, the moral naturalist can argue that for foundational\nmoral issues, such as whether animals or human fetuses have rights, the\ntheoretical identities, concerning say what it is for something to have\na moral right, become directly relevant to discussion. In sum, unless\nthe non-moral cases can be shown to be disanalogous to the moral ones,\nthe objection does not defeat moral naturalism.\n4. Evolutionary: Biological Explanations of Why Morals Evolved\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the last three objections to moral naturalism\nare advanced by those who believe moral knowledge is possible but\nreject the idea that it is knowledge of the natural world. Of course,\nshould those objections be successful, the upshot could be a victory\nfor the moral skeptic, since the objections to thinking of moral\nknowledge as theological or as knowledge of a non-natural world may be\njust as successful. The problems for the possibility of moral\nknowledge, in short, must be seen holistically in view of the\ninterlocking implications of the objections and replies. The following\ndiscussion of the implications of biological explanations of morals is\nno exception.\n\n\nSome moral skeptics argue that Darwinian explanations of the origins\nand persistence of morals among humans undermine the likelihood that\nmoral beliefs are true and hence undermine the possibility of moral\nknowledge. These \u201cdebunking\u201d arguments are discussed under three\nheadings. In each case we suppose, as Darwin suggested (Darwin 1982\n[1871]), that human morality originated and persisted among our\nancestors primarily as an adaptation fashioned by natural\nselection. This supposition is compatible with cultural evolution\nplaying an enormous role in bringing us from proto-morals to modern\nforms of morality in all their striking variation. The basic thought,\nhowever, is that primitive moral inclinations, such as toward helping\nfamily and avoiding harm even to strangers, remain with us as prima\nfacie reasons for action, even when contrary moral considerations may\noverride these core inclinations. Thus, even though modern moralities\nhave evolved culturally, they are, on this premise, constructed from\ncertain core adaptations. That thought is well-developed in current\naccounts of the evolution of morals (see Copp 2008, pp. 187\u201390, and\nCampbell 2009, for a summary and references). While it is not beyond\ncriticism (see the entry on Morality and Evolutionary Biology), I will\nassume this premise, for the sake of argument, without further\nelaboration. Strikingly, this premise, if granted, is enough to give\nweight to the three debunking arguments that follow.\n4.1 The Debunking Argument from Parsimony, Clarity, and Non-circularity\n\n\nSome debunkers argue that the Darwinian explanation of core moral\nbeliefs is in direct competition with the commonsense view that these\ncore beliefs are true and that we believe them because their truth is\nobvious. They argue, however, that the Darwinian explanation of our\ncore moral beliefs is superior, since it is more parsimonious,\nclearer, and better supported by the evidence (Ruse 1986; Joyce\n2006; Street 2006: Kahane 2011). The Darwinian explanation is\nbetter, first of all, because it does not need to postulate the\nexistence of any moral truth. We have seen in the preceding section\nhow difficult it is to explain in uncontested ontological terms what\nmoral truth might consist in. The things whose existence is\nfundamental in the Darwinian story, on the other hand, are neither\nmysterious nor contentious, such as the tendency to reciprocate\nkindness and extend help to those in need. Moreover, the mechanism of\nnatural selection is, in general terms at least, very well-understood\nand could be applied to the altruistic tendencies mentioned. Core\nmoral \u201cbeliefs\u201d would be taken to express just such heritable\ntendencies. Individuals in groups with more of these tendencies than\nother groups would do better at survival and reproduction than those\nin other groups so that the tendencies would in time spread among\ngroups in the larger population (Kitcher 1993; Sober and Wilson\n1998; Bowles and Gintis 2011). By contrast, theories about how our ancestors were able to\ngrasp moral truth, say by means of rational intuition or religious\nfaith, are comparatively unclear and do not cohere with current\nscience. Of course, we are assuming just for the sake of argument,\nthat the evidence that supports the Darwinian explanation is\ncogent. To be fair, could we not make a parallel assumption about the\nevidence for the truth of core moral beliefs? Unfortunately, it is far\nfrom clear what that evidence would be unless it includes the truth of\nsome of the very core beliefs whose nature we are trying to explain,\napparently rendering the explanation circular. In sum, the commonsense\nstory of why we have the core moral beliefs that we do is inferior to\nthe simpler, clearer, and non-question-begging Darwinian\nexplanation.\n\n\nAn immediate difficulty with this debunking argument is that it\nassumes that moral beliefs are not about moral properties that are\nalso natural properties and hence are empirically knowable and can\ninteract causally with other natural properties (compare Sturgeon\u2019s\nreply to Harman in Sturgeon 1985; see also Campbell 1996, on\nRuse). Consideration of moral naturalism, that is, opens up the\npossibility that those of our ancestors who tended to respond\npositively to moral properties had an advantage in survival and\nreproduction, because these properties are causally connected with\nmutual well-being. There are many forms of moral naturalism that allow\nthis approach to the compatibility of moral truth and Darwinian moral\nevolution (Brandt 1979; Sturgeon 1985; Railton 1986; Boyd 1988;\nBrink 1989; Copp 1995, 2008; Churchland 1998, 2000; Sober and\nWilson 1998; Rottschaefer 1998; Casebeer 2003; de Waal 2006;\nCampbell 1998, 2009; Kumar 2017). Though the success of such theories depends on\nthe details, they cannot be dismissed on the ground of parsimony,\nsince moral truths would not presuppose properties of a special or\nnon-natural kind. While the truths might be viewed as suspect in other\nrespects, for example, they would be both normative and natural\n(Joyce 2006), we have already addressed such worries in the\nsub-section 3.3 on moral naturalism. They are not new problems\noccasioned by evolutionary theory. Finally, there is no special\nepistemic problem of circularity when it comes to understanding\nevidence for such a theory, other than what we have already discussed\nin 3.3. In short, the debunking evolutionary argument from parsimony,\nclarity, and non-circularity is by itself no threat to moral\nnaturalism.\n4.2 The Debunking Argument from Moral Objectivism\n\n\nIn the past decade a new style of evolutionary debunking argument has\nemerged that pits moral objectivism against the Darwinian origins of\nmorals. While moral naturalism in some forms may not be at odds with\nunderstanding core moral beliefs as having a biological basis, such\nbeliefs, it is argued, cannot embody objective moral knowledge in a\nrobust sense. We must in effect choose between the Darwinian\nexplanation and fully objective moral knowledge. Sharon Street (2006)\npresses this dilemma with careful attention to possible replies. She\nacknowledges that the kind of moral naturalism advanced by Peter\nRailton (1986) is compatible with the evolutionary basis of our core\nmoral beliefs but argues that the price of embracing such naturalism\nis to give up thinking of moral truths as having the kind of objective\nstatus that moral philosophers often attribute to them. She is happy\nto pay that price, but others have contended that the assumption of\nobjectivity, in particular moral realism, is built into how moral\nknowledge is commonly understood (Mackie 1977, Joyce 2006).For the\nlatter group the dilemma presents an attack on the existence of moral\nknowledge, as most of us understand the concept. Since the aim of this\nessay is to review the issues concerning whether genuine moral\nknowledge is possible, we need to assess the merits of this debunking\nargument, paying close attention to how the ideal of objectivity is\nunderstood in this context.\n\n\nExactly what does the required objectivity consist in? Street,\nfollowing Russ Shafer-Landau (2003, p. 15), says that a moral truth\n(or fact) is objective in the sense required by morality when it is\n\u201cstance-independent,\u201d when, that is, it would hold independently of all\nour evaluative attitudes, taken collectively, whether we have them now\nor would have them on reflection under ideal conditions. Evaluative\nattitudes include \u201cdesires, attitudes of approval or disapproval,\nunreflective evaluative tendencies such as the tendency to experience\nX as counting in favor of or demanding Y, and consciously or\nunconsciously held evaluative judgments, such as judgments about what\nis a reason for what, about what one should do or ought to do, about\nwhat is good, valuable, or worthwhile, about what is morally right or\nwrong, and so on\u201d (Street 2006, p. 110). An implication of this\nunderstanding of objectivity, as Street points out, is that it cannot\nbe the case that what we now take to be moral truths or facts are\nobjective in the required sense but could have been different, and\nstill objectively true or factual, if humans had evolved\ndifferently. For example, the following cannot be objectively true: in\ngeneral people are not morally required to sacrifice themselves for\nthe entire community, but they would have been so required if we had\nevolved more on the model of social insects. If moral truths or facts\nwere contingent on evolution in this way (as they would be, to give\nanother example, if moral facts were identified with facts about which\nmoral values would favor diversity in the human gene pool, Wilson\n1978, p. 205), they could not be objective in the strict way demanded\nby Shafer-Landau. (See also Kahane 2011, on the role of moral\nobjectivism in debunking morals.)\n\n\nThere are two ways to go if one wishes to defend the possibility of\nmoral knowledge against the argument from moral objectivism. One is to\nreject the concept of stance-independent objectivity as a necessary\ncondition on moral truth. Studies show that even young children after\na certain age make an intuitive distinction between conventional\ndemands and moral demands (Nichols 2004). Basic moral demands unlike\nconventional ones are taken to be independent of authority (for\nexample, that of a teacher in a classroom) and to be independent of\ntime and place (to apply universally to all persons). These features\nappear to capture at least part of what it is for a moral demand to be\nobjective. Note, however, that these features are not enough to\nguarantee stance-independence. For example, physical pain, considered\njust in itself, is plausibly considered to be universally bad for the\nperson experiencing it, apart from what any authority might decree,\nyet this moral truth is arguably not stance-independent. Why? An\nessential part of what constitutes the experience of physical pain is\nto have a sensation towards which one has a negative evaluative\nresponse. This last part of the experience is what makes it bad for\nthe person suffering pain. But then, its being intrinsically bad is a\ntruth that is stance-dependent. If this argument is sound, we\nmust accept moral skepticism about the objective badness of pain for\nthe person suffering it or else understand the intrinsic badness of\npain for the person who has it not to be objective in this strong\nsense. (Street offers a more complex argument to the same conclusion:\nStreet 2006, pp. 144\u201352.) Given this dilemma a possible line of\ndefense is to argue that in light of such examples the objectivity of\nmoral truth does not entail stance-independence.\n\n\nThe other option is to meet the challenge head-on and argue in the\ncase of a particular moral theory that core moral truths in this\ntheory would be stance-independent and also compatible with the\nDarwinian evolution of morals. David Copp (2008) pursues this course\nof argument using his society-centered moral theory sketched\nearlier. He argues that because moral truth on his theory concerns the\nneeds of human society, one can expect that under propitious\nconditions the more biologically fit moral inclinations would tend to\ntrack (or \u201cquasi-track,\u201d his term) certain core moral truths. Copp\u2019s\nargument is complex, but it presents a possible avenue of defense that\nis worth consideration.\n4.3 The Debunking Argument from the Irrationality of Moral Emotions\n\n\nThe third line of thinking that puts the evolution of morals at\nloggerheads with moral knowledge arises from recent developments in\nmoral psychology and neurobiology. In the past decade several\nprominent psychologists have applied the emerging dual process model\nof the brain to design experiments to reveal how we process moral\njudgments (Greene 2008, 2010 (Other Internet Resources), 2013; Haidt\n2001; Cushman et al. 2006). One type of thinking (system 1)\nis fast, unconscious, automatic, intuitive, and guided by\nemotions. The other (system 2) is slow, conscious, deliberate,\nreflective, and devoid of emotion. Though there remains considerable\ncontroversy about the details (Berker 2009; Greene 2010 (Other\nInternet Resources), 2013), various experiments, including fMRI brain\nstudies, suggest that deontological moral judgment, where one assesses\nthe moral acceptability of actions apart from their consequences, is\nguided solely by system 1 thinking while consequentialist moral\njudgment engages system 2. Since processing in the latter case is\nunemotional, entailing reasoned comparison of possible consequences,\nonly consequentialist thought is properly associated with the rational\nmoral appraisal of actions. Notably, the latter thinking is regarded\nas less primitive from an evolutionary standpoint. By contrast, system\n1 thinking, being tied to intuitive emotional judgments, represents an\nadaptation that was once useful but has by now largely lost its point\ngiven the challenges of life in modern technological society (Greene\n2008, 2010 (Other Internet Resources), 2013; but see\nGigerenzer 2008 and Railton 2014 for a contrary perspective on\nintuitive moral judgments). These claims, when taken together, form\nthe basis of a psychological/evolutionary argument to debunk\ndeontological moral thinking as unreliable and irrational.\n\n\nThe story taken just this far, whatever its merits, appears to allow\nthe possibility of moral knowledge grounded in consequentialist\nreasoning. All the data used to draw negative conclusions about\ndeontological moral thought, however, can be interpreted to support a\nbroader debunking argument, since consequentialist thinking requires\nnot only reasoned calculation of the probable effects of alternative\nactions, but also judgment about whether these effects are good or bad\n(Kahane 2011, pp. 119\u201320). In the latter respect, system 1 would play\nan essential role. If system 1 contaminates the rationality of\ndeontological judgments, given its emotional and primitive\nevolutionary nature, the possibility of consequentialist moral\nknowledge would be undermined in the same way. Though one might reply\nthat moral beliefs formed by thinking about the consequences of\nactions arise in part from reasoning, the core part of the belief,\nconcerning whether the consequences are on the whole good or bad, is\nnot itself rational but emotional (following the logic of the\nargument) and hence cannot qualify as rationally justified, as it\nwould need to be in order to qualify as moral knowledge. In effect,\nthe possibility of moral knowledge is foreclosed no matter what kind\nof moral belief is in question. (See Kahane 2011, for a careful\nelaboration and evaluation of the ensuring global normative\nskepticism.)\n\n\nThough the question of whether the data support a dual process theory\nof brain activity and whether moral thinking divides up in the way\ndescribed is hotly debated, a larger and equally serious problem\nconcerns the assumed opposition between emotional and rational\nthinking. Many experimental studies of practical reasoning yield the\nopposite conclusion, namely, that emotional processing of information\nplays an essential role in prudential reasoning (de Sousa 1987;\nDamasio 1994; Woodward and Allman 2007; Bloom 2013; Railton\n2014). Emotional processing is especially important when the relevant\nvariables are too many and too complex to process entirely through\nconscious reasoning, so that rational thinking and rational behavior\ndepend on the emotional capacity to feel one\u2019s way through practical\nproblems. There is no principled reason why the same would not be true\nin complex practical deliberation about moral issues (Allman and\nWoodward 2008). Research in this regard has only begun, but even now\nit is questionable to assume without argument that the reason-emotion\ndichotomy presupposed in the third type of debunking argument is\ntrustworthy enough to rule out moral knowledge, even if all moral\njudgments have the emotional basis claimed.\n\n\nRecent developments regarding moral consistency reasoning underline\nthe role of emotion in moral reasoning (Campbell and Kumar 2012,\n2013; Kumar and Campbell 2012, 2016; Campbell 2014, 2017 see also Wong 2002 on\nanalogical moral reasoning). Return to Singer\u2019s example of a man\nseeing a toddler about to drown in a shallow pond and knowing that the\nonly cost of saving her life would be ruining his new suit. One can be\nexpected to have feelings of strong disapproval toward anyone who did\nnot try to save a child in any similar situation. Suppose, however,\nthere is another situation, say one in which someone\u2019s life is at\nstake and that person can be saved at no more cost than losing a new\nsuit, say by giving funds for famine relief. If one does not feel as\nbefore about this new situation, then there should be a moral\ndifference between them to explain the difference in emotional\nresponse, or else one is being morally inconsistent in one\u2019s moral\nemotions. Moreover, this kind of moral inconsistency is morally\nculpable, revealing one not to be fully morally trustworthy as a moral\nagent. Singer argues, in fact, that one\u2019s response to the opportunity\nto provide funds for famine relief (at least equivalent to the cost of\na new suit) ought to be the same as in the pond case, since (he\nclaims) there is no morally relevant difference. (He considers various\ncandidates for difference but argues that thinking they are morally\nrelevant results in further inconsistencies depending on the\ncandidate.) When there are no relevant moral differences between two\nsituations and the moral import of one\u2019s response to them is\ndifferent, both responses cannot be morally justified. Though Singer\u2019s\nfocus is on whether one\u2019s moral obligation is the same, the logic of\nhis argument would be the same whether the inconsistency is between\nmoral beliefs or moral emotions. In general we are expected to be\nmorally consistent in our moral beliefs and in our moral emotions.\n\n\nSometimes moral beliefs and moral emotions can diverge, yet it can be\nrational to trust the moral emotion rather than the moral belief. In\nSection 3 we discussed the hybrid conception of moral judgment that\nallows for this kind of separation of belief and emotion. One of the\nexamples was that of a woman who feels strong moral resentment at\nhaving been passed over for promotion in favour of someone whose\nperformance was inferior to hers. It is possible that she doesn\u2019t\nbelieve that she has been wronged, perhaps because she believes the\nman performed better and her feelings are not trustworthy. Suppose\nthat her resentment persists, despite her efforts to ignore it. Must\nher moral emotion then be irrational? Imagine that she feels\nresentment because in fact she can recognize no morally relevant\ndifference between her case and that of the other that would explain\nwhy she wasn\u2019t promoted. Even if she does not at first consciously\nthink about it in this way, her resentment can arise because her\nemotions have been attuned to respond to other cases where a promotion\nhas been granted unfairly and where in retrospect there is no doubt in\nanyone\u2019s mind (like the pond case) what would have been the right\nthing to do. In short, her moral emotion may be rationally grounded,\nif there exists no morally relevant difference between her situation\nand one in which the morally right response is not in doubt from\nanyone\u2019s perspective but is contrary to the decision made in her\ncase.\n\n\nThe idea that emotion may enter unconsciously into good reasoning and\nyield a moral emotion that has a better rational basis than a person\u2019s\nconsciously held beliefs may seem surprising. However, there is a\ngrowing literature in cognitive science over the past decade that\nsupports the cognitive sophistication of our affective system that\noperates largely unconsciously in practical decision-making. For an\nilluminating review of these developments that links insights of\nAristotle and Kant to the unconscious cognitive work done by our\nevolved system of \u201caffective attunement\u201d, see Railton 2014. The lesson\nis not that belief and emotion do not generally cohere in moral\njudgment, but that emotion is itself cognitively complex and can make\nits own independent and rationally based contribution to moral\njudgment.\n5. Methodological: Epistemology Naturalized, Reflective Equilibrium, Rational Choice, and Pragmatic Naturalism\n\n\nThus far we have not addressed directly the question of methodology in\nlooking at the question whether moral knowledge is possible. In the\npast several decades, however, four new methodologies have gained\nprominence and the import of each for the possibility of moral\nknowledge has been widely debated. Some who support the movement to\nnaturalize epistemology, for example, endorse the possibility of moral\nknowledge; others do not. Either way, the new philosophical\nmethodology contained in the movement raises new issues for moral\nepistemology to resolve.\n5.1 Epistemology Naturalized\n\n\nWhat is this new methodology? Quine, who introduced naturalized\nepistemology five decades ago (Quine 1969a), urges epistemologists to\nrenounce the project of explaining knowledge a priori, from first\nprinciples, thus independently of science. The traditional approach to\nknowledge had been to reason about the possibility of knowledge and\nabout the kinds of things that can be known without assuming from the\noutset that we already possess considerable knowledge through science.\nEven the classical empiricists, who argued that knowledge derives\nultimately from sense experience, defended this perspective without\nrelying primarily on scientific theories to establish their\nconclusions. Hume, in particular, was led to a skeptical conclusion\nregarding the possibility of justifying the methods used in reasoning\nfrom experience. He thought any justification of inductive reasoning\nthat uses such reasoning would be circular (Hume, An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, Book I, Sections IV-V). Quine,\nhowever, dismisses such circularity as a problem for two reasons.\nFirst, the prospect of reasoning independently of all empirical\nassumptions is a will-o-the-wisp, and second, the most troubling source\nof skepticism arises from the present scientific understanding of how\nperception works and hence should be resolved by science itself. Thus,\nQuine advocates that epistemology be carried out within science.\n\n\nThough this suggestion is highly controversial and not all who\nfollow Quine\u2019s lead are prepared to endorse the radical form of\nnaturalized epistemology in which epistemology becomes part of science,\nthe idea of enlisting science in the task of understanding how\nknowledge is possible has gained wide acceptance (Kornblith 1994). We\nneed to consider, then, what the implications are for moral\nepistemology in particular. Does naturalized epistemology logically\nentail moral naturalism? In fact, their relationship is more complex.\nIt is possible to accept the former but reject the latter without\nevident contradiction. Many philosophers who are attracted to\nnaturalized epistemology believe that the natural world is morally\nneutral in itself. From their standpoint the project of naturalizing\nepistemology is only to understand how non-moral knowledge is possible\nby drawing on the resources of science. Quine himself is in this\ncategory. On the other hand, it is possible to believe that moral\nproperties are natural properties but hold that the principles of\nreasoning that allow one to reach this conclusion are not themselves to\nbe explained by science. It is one thing to think, for example, that\nacting rightly is the same as maximizing pleasure over pain; it is\nquite another to think that science can tell us whether these\nproperties of actions are at bottom the same.\n\n\nNevertheless, while naturalized epistemology and moral naturalism\nare logically distinct, it is arguable that anyone who subscribes to\nnaturalized epistemology and believes that moral knowledge is possible\nshould be a moral naturalist. For if moral knowledge is part of\nknowledge and all knowledge is to be explained within science, then\nmoral knowledge itself must be explainable within science, and that\nwould be possible, it would seem, only if moral properties were natural\nproperties that we learn to identify empirically. There exist, however,\nseveral major problems for anyone who endorses both moral naturalism\nand naturalized epistemology, at least in the radical form advocated by\nQuine. The reason is that the strategies that seem promising for\naddressing standard objections to naturalized epistemology are in\ntension with the possibility of moral knowledge. Consideration of two\nstandard objections shows how strategies for coping with them can lead\nto difficulty.\n5.1.1 Losing the normative dimension of moral knowledge\n\n\nOne standard objection to including epistemology within science is\nthat science is committed to providing only an adequate description of\nthe natural world and cannot tell us the world ought to be.\nEpistemology, in marked contrast, is a normative enterprise. It is\nsupposed to tell us how we ought to reason from evidence and\nhow we ought to justify our beliefs, not merely tell us how we\ndo reason or how we do go about justifying them. By\nincluding epistemology within science, therefore, we rob it of\nnormative content that is essential to its being epistemology (Kim\n1988). A promising reply is to dispute the assumption that science is\nmerely a descriptive enterprise, lacking in any normative content. It\nmay be argued that in science the normative and the descriptive are\nboth present. Not only are normative assumptions implicit in scientific\npractice, but these assumptions can be the subject of intense debate\nand reflection within science. Indeed, any adequate description of\nscientific practice bears out this sociological observation. The\nobjection rests on a false premise (Campbell 1998).\n\n\nThe problem is to work out this line of reply for naturalized moral\nepistemology. What is often a matter of intense debate is what\nstandards of evidence are appropriate for testing a certain type of\ntheory. Normative concerns are present in the form of worries about\nepistemic standards, such as the role of statistical significance in\npsychological experiments. But epistemic standards are not moral\nstandards. To develop a parallel defense to the charge that the moral\ndimension is missing from naturalized moral epistemology, we would have\nto argue that moral values are operating in science and further that we\ncan decide which moral values are appropriate for science through\nscientific debate. Many would agree that moral values, such as honesty,\ntrust, and loyalty, do operate in science, but not many are prepared to\nconcede that matters critical to moral epistemology can be decided by\nthe methods of science. Can science tell us, for example, how we would\nknow when honesty should be sacrificed for the sake of loyalty?\n\n\nIn the face of this challenge it may be tempting for a believer in\nthe possibility of moral knowledge simply to reject the project of\nnaturalizing moral epistemology. An immediate difficulty in taking this\nway out is the close connection between this project and moral\nnaturalism, together with the role that the latter theory plays in\naddressing the ontological problems raised in section 3. Earlier\nwe noted how the naturalizing project in moral epistemology can lead a\nbeliever in moral knowledge toward moral naturalism. The reverse is\nalso true for a person who accepts a naturalized epistemology for\nnon-moral knowledge. If such a person thinks that moral features of the\nworld can be found among its natural properties and that these\nproperties can be investigated empirically, she will have a hard time\nexplaining why science is incapable of explaining what these moral\nproperties are and how we can know them. In sum, we may need moral\nnaturalism to address the ontological problems for moral knowledge, but\nthen we are led to a naturalized moral epistemology and to the\nchallenge now before us.\n\n\nOne source of resistance to moral epistemology being part of science\nmay be the picture of scientists trying to decide moral questions by\nreference to graphs, lab reports, and print-outs from machines, as if\nthe answer to moral questions might be read off of data sheets. We have\nalready noted that his picture of scientific practice is excessively\nnarrow. It fails to reflect the fact that scientists debate the\nimplications of their data and debate the merits of the epistemic\nstandards used in their debates. The key issue then is whether it is\npossible to draw a line between these debates and moral ones and to\ndeclare moral debates to lie outside of science proper. Although Quine\napparently thought this possible, his holistic approach to matters of\nevidence suggests otherwise. If moral beliefs have truth-value, as\nmoral naturalism implies, then the \u201cweb of belief\u201d to which Quine often\nalludes would include moral beliefs (White 1986, Jack Nelson 1996).\nRecall that a moral naturalist will invoke moral facts to explain\ncertain non-moral facts, for example, the fact that American chattel\nslavery was so morally repugnant to explain, in part, the extent of the\nresistance to it at the time of the American civil war (Sturgeon 1985).\nIf this kind of interaction between the moral and the non-moral is on\nthe cards, it would be odd to preclude moral questions a priori from\nscientific discussion.\n\n\nA number of recent articles and books have defended a holistic\napproach to the place of moral value within scientific and other\nempirical investigations, recognizing moral claims as being\nepistemically interdependent with claims about non-moral facts (White\n1981, Sturgeon 1985, Miller 1992, Lynn Nelson 1996, Rottschaefer 1998,\nCampbell 1998). Though a review of that literature is beyond the scope\nof this essay, it is worth stressing that this conception of science is\nnot widely held and that if it were generally accepted by scientists,\nthen the practice of science would change significantly. The position\nthat is entertained here in response to the last difficulty is not that\ncurrent science routinely and effectively engages in moral discussion,\nmuch less that current science provides a model for such discussion.\nThe point is that there may be no principled reason to exclude this\npossibility for the future direction of science and that there may be\nprincipled reasons to allow it, given the epistemological implications\nof moral naturalism.\n5.1.2 Global skepticism and the problem of circularity\n\n\nA second standard objection to naturalized epistemology is that it\ngives up the project of answering the global skeptic and as a\nconsequence fails to address, much less resolve, a central issue in\nepistemology. It must surrender this project because by operating\nwithin science it assumes that we already have some knowledge and hence\nbegs the question against the global skeptic. For example, Quine\nappeals to Darwin to explain why our native inductive tendencies (used\nsay in tracking the location of middle-sized objects moving in our\nimmediate vicinity) must do better than chance in getting the right\nanswer or else the tendencies would have been selected against long ago\n(Quine 1969b). Yet in assuming that we have good inductive grounds to\nbelieve Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, we justify induction by assuming\nthat it is justified and thereby reason in a circle.\n\n\nTwo kinds of replies to this objection are worth considering. The\nfirst, suggested in the brief statement of Quine\u2019s new methodology, is\nto reject the old problem as based on the false presupposition that one\ncan vindicate scientific and other knowledge on the basis of\npropositions that are knowable a priori. The difficulty with this\nresponse is that it raises the difficult issues of whether a priori\nknowledge is possible and whether we can determine an answer to that\nquestion a posteriori. Another reply, perhaps more in keeping with the\nspirit of naturalized epistemology, is not to dismiss global skepticism\nout of hand, but to allow science to attempt to explain science within\nits own terms, recognizing that the effort will be circular but\ndefending its legitimacy. The effort is legitimate, it might be argued,\nbecause the circularity does not guarantee the success of the effort.\nThe appeal to Darwin, for example, may not succeed, either because\nDarwin\u2019s theory is overthrown or because a necessary background\nassumption (say that our native inductive tendencies are gene linked)\nis contradicted by the evidence. In fact, Quine allowed that the\nproject to explain science from within science could defeat itself, in\nthe end vindicating the skeptic (Quine 1981, p. 22). On this approach\nknowledge claims are always open to questioning and perhaps rejection\ndown the road. Any justification that is offered for induction or\nclaims of knowledge based on induction is ultimately fallible and\nrevisable.\n\n\nCan this kind of answer to the circularity charge be extended to\nnaturalized moral epistemology? Can we offer the moral skeptic the same\nkind of reply? It may be that we cannot, since the two cases appear to\nbe importantly different. While we may consider global skepticism an\ninteresting theoretical challenge, few of us feel the need to address\nit before getting on with our lives. We may be content to follow the\nadvice that we assume that we already know many things and then (if we\nare so inclined) attempt to explain how we know so much, relying on\nwhat we already think we know. With moral skepticism the situation\nappears different. Most of us are far more prone to doubt the\npossibility of moral knowledge than we are to question whether we know\nanything at all. Moral doubts affect our confidence in making daily\nmoral decisions. Thus, to follow the former advice and assume for now\nthat we know what we believe we know in order to justify our decisions\nmay seem to be illegitimately circular. The need for justification is\nmore pressing in the moral case; hence, the methodology of justifying\nour moral beliefs by allowing ourselves to believe about moral matters\nwhat we have been raised to believe is more questionable (Campbell and\nHunter 2000).\n\n\nThe defender of naturalized moral epistemology can reply that\nhowever urgent justification may be, no alternative exists to relying\non background assumptions when we try to justify specific claims. At\ntimes the justification of non-moral knowledge claims can be similarly\nurgent, as in deciding political, economic, or environmental policy.\nWhat is in doubt need not be the moral importance of, for example,\npreventing certain harms, but rather the means to achieve this end. In\nthese cases we will seek statistical and other evidence to support our\nbeliefs, but there exists now a firm consensus among philosophers of\nscience that the justification provided by evidence for a hypothesis\nwill depend for its credibility on theoretical background assumptions.\nThese in turn may require defense, but in general there is no way to\nproceed but to assume something that we think we know until we have\nsufficient reason to reject the assumption. In this respect, the\ndefender of naturalized epistemology can say that moral knowledge and\nnon-moral knowledge are on a par. This response is of a piece with the\nreply to the last challenge in that it appeals to the holistic nature\nof justification. Unless this appeal is blocked somehow, moral\nknowledge remains a viable possibility when moral epistemology is\nnaturalized.\n5.2 Reflective Equilibrium and Rational Choice\n\n\nTwo allied methodologies need to be mentioned that arose along side\nof naturalized epistemology in the last century. Goodman introduced the\nconcept of a reflective equilibrium in addressing the problem of\njustifying induction (Goodman 1955). Rules of inference would be\nformulated to explain what one takes to be valid scientific reasoning,\nmuch as one might formulate deductive inference rules to explain valid\ninferences of mathematicians. Application of these rules may, however,\nyield conclusions that are contrary to one\u2019s considered judgment in a\ngiven case. Then a choice is necessary between revising one\u2019s judgment\nto bring it into line with the systematic implications of the other\nspecific judgments, or else revising the rules (with the possible\nconsequence that a similar problem will arise in another quarter). One\nproceeds until reaching (for the time being) a reflective equilibrium\nin considered judgments, including judgments about the rules that best\nexplain one\u2019s inferences. The proposed methodology is like that of\nnaturalized epistemology. It begins by taking for granted, at least\ninitially, that the methods of science are sound and then attempts to\nformulate the principles that explain it by working within science,\nrevising the principles or the practice as necessary to achieve a more\ncoherent overall understanding. A significant difference is that the\nmethod seeks explicitly to arrive at acceptable normative\nprinciples.\n\n\nRawls self-consciously applies the concept of reflective equilibrium\nin explaining the method of justification underlying his theory of\nsocial justice (Rawls 1971). Rawls applies the methodology, of course,\nto justify considered moral judgments found outside of science.\nHowever, he takes no judgments to be established simply a priori. The\nclaims about justice are justified in part by their implications when\ntaken together with what we assume to be known in psychological,\nsocial, and economic theory. Others have elaborated this methodology\nso that a \u201cwide reflective equilibrium\u201d would be reached\nonly after consideration of relevant background assumptions, regarding\nsuch things as personal identity and rational choice, as well as\nrelevant alternative theories (Daniels 1976). Still others argue that\nwide reflective equilibrium reasoning should not be confused with a\ndifferent but complementary reasoning that directly compares opposing\nmoral judgments about particular but similar cases without reference\nto general principles. Moral consistency reasoning, as it is called,\ncan support but it can also undermine wide reflective equilibrium\nreasoning. Both may be needed to reach morally defensible conclusions\n(Campbell 2014).\n\n\nA complication is that the justification of moral claims in Rawls\nproceeds also by arguing that rational persons in a hypothetical\n\u201coriginal position\u201d of freedom and equality would be rational to choose\ncertain principles of social justice. Though in this appeal to rational\nchoice Rawls is explicitly engaged in a social contract theory of\njustice and thus a particular type of normative theory, the\nimplications are more general. The larger suggestion is that moral\ntruth is based significantly on which moral norms can be rationally\nchosen by members of a given society as norms under which they would be\nprepared to live. (Compare the accounts of moral truth in Brandt 1979,\nCopp 1995, and Braybrooke 2001, none of which defend social contract\ntheory, but all of which base moral truth on rational choice. Gauthier\n1986 appeals to rational choice to determine which moral norms are\njustified but without supposing that moral judgments have truth\nvalue.)\n\n\nThe methodology of basing moral truth on rational choice and the\nmethodology of invoking the ideal of a reflective equilibrium of\nconsidered judgments both endeavor to square moral knowledge with a\nscientific world view and as such are allied with naturalized\nepistemology. Both, however, explicitly make room for normative claims\nand so avoid the charge that the normative dimension is missing from\ntheir account of moral knowledge. Unfortunately they face the charge of\nmaking moral truth more likely than not to reflect the moral status quo.\nLet us allow that a person may come to revise many beliefs, including\nmany moral beliefs, before reaching a wide reflective equilibrium in\njudgments. Why should we think that the most stubborn moral judgments\nin a given reflective equilibrium are more likely to be true than the\nones that gave way to them in the process of reaching a reflective\nequilibrium (Copp 1985)? The reply may be that this approach is no\nworse off than naturalized epistemology, since we must take some moral\nclaims for granted, at least tentatively, and proceed until there is\nreason to revise our judgments given their lack of fit with everything\nelse we think we know. Moral conservatism is also a problem for the\nmethodology that bases moral truth on rational choice, since rational\nchoice turns on individual preferences and these are inevitably shaped\nby the moral status quo (Babbitt 1996 and Campbell 1998).\n5.3 Pragmatic Naturalism\n\n\nBuilding on the pioneering work of American pragmatists, notably\nWilliam James (James 1907) and John Dewey (Dewey 1922; Dewey &\nTufts 1932), Philip Kitcher (Kitcher 2011a) has recently revitalized\nthe pragmatic, naturalistic approach to moral knowledge evident in\nearlier thinkers. (For his general defence of pragmatism, see his\npapers in Kitcher 2012.) Like naturalized epistemology,\n\u201cpragmatic naturalism\u201d, to use his term, eschews appeal to\na priori knowledge but also rejects the ideal of moral knowledge of a\nreality to be discovered in nature that is static and not under human\ncontrol. Pragmatic naturalism is thus distinct from ontological\nnaturalism already discussed above in 3.3. Though principles of\nrational choice can play a role in moral learning on this view, all\nprinciples are open to revision and, more importantly, grounds for\nmoral change need not appeal to a reflective equilibrium of principles\nand judgments. Instead, moral knowledge is part of a long cultural\nevolutionary process of humans working out among themselves how they\ncan live together, initially in small groups, through imposing\nconstraints on their interactions and setting goals consistent with\nthem that they can strive toward collectively. Moral knowledge is\nmoral \u201cknow-how\u201d that emerges first out of primitive tendencies\nfashioned by natural selection and from cooperative efforts within\ngroups to live peacefully while competing for resources with other\ngroups. Alliances between groups form when necessary and in some cases\ncodes of conduct apply to allied groups. Humans achieve moral\nprogress, not by discovering truth that exists apart from their\nsocieties, but by fulfilling the various functions of ethical norms as\nthese functions gradually emerge through engagement in \u201cthe ethical\nproject\u201d.\n\n\nSuch pragmatic naturalism, as moral epistemology, has strong\naffinities with the methodologies just canvassed and shares many of\ntheir virtues. For example, when discussing cases of moral progress,\nsuch as the abolition of slavery in the United States and improvement\nover the last century in civil status of women in Europe and the\nUnited States, Kitcher focuses on the reasons for moral change that\nwere in fact operating in these cases rather than on principles that\nmight rationalize the changes without necessarily explaining\nthem. Like naturalized epistemology the focus is on looking for the\nreasons that are also causes. Like reflective equilibrium theory and\nrational choice theory, the focus is sensitive to tensions within\nmoral perspectives both theoretical and practical, such as the\napparent contradiction of maintaining the view that women as wives and\nmothers should not be educated while having to concede, as Mary\nWollstonecraft argued (Kitcher 2011a, 148\u201350), that they would better\nfulfill their role in their families if they were educated or, as John\nWoolman pointed out (Kitcher 2011a, 158\u201361), maintaining a Christian\nview of the equal worth of every human while tolerating chattel\nslavery. Kitcher\u2019s argument in these and similar cases is that\nimprovement in moral knowledge was not achieved through the use of\ngeneral abstract principles but has depended instead on reconciling\nconflicts of moral values so that their emerging functions are better\nserved. See also Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s discussion of how people learned\nthat slavery is wrong (Anderson 2016). At the same time,\nbecause pragmatists, such as Kitcher and Anderson, focus on cases of\nradical moral change from the status quo, the charge of moral\nconservatism that faces reflective equilibrium and rational choices\ntheories of moral knowledge tends to be undercut.\n\n\nWe have to ask, however, whether pragmatic naturalism is a method that\nyields genuine moral knowledge, since it seems to replace reference to\nknowledge of moral truth with knowledge of the practical means for\nresolving human conflict. Are not the two very different? Is not this\npragmatic understanding of moral knowledge, for all its virtues, an\nimpostor that really fails to signify something that has the\ntranscendent moral authority that we intuitively associate with\ngenuine moral truth? There is ample experimental work confirming that\nall of us, including children, are able to distinguish conventional\nauthority from moral authority, where the latter is understood to take\nprecedence over what is claimed to be right by those in positions of\nauthority within a society or what current norms viewed as\nauthoritative are thought to imply (Nichols 2004). If that were not\nso, it would have made no sense for advocates of moral change to hold\nthat conventional moral authority was violating the moral rights of\nhumans treated as property or unworthy of education. Kitcher tries to\naddress this problem by arguing that pragmatic naturalism allows a\nrobust conception of moral truth but one that is not prior to our\nunderstanding of moral progress (Kitcher 2011a, 245\u20139). Another way to\naddress the problem would be to conceive of moral truth so that it\ndoes not imply a realist conception of moral truth but one that is\nrobustly objective in that it allows the possibility of massive moral\nerror among would-be knowers despite all efforts to know the truth\n(Campbell & Kumar 2013). Truth has been a central concern to\npragmatism from its inception (Misak 2013) and the problem of moral\ntruth bears critically on the viability of pragmatic naturalism as a\nmethodology for understanding the possibility of moral knowledge.\n6. Moral: Feminist Epistemology and the Bias Paradox\n\n\nAnother relatively recent development in epistemology is the\nmovement to view epistemology from the perspective of feminism (Jaggar\n1983 and 1989, Code 1991, Anderson 1995, Alcoff 1996). The growth of\ninterest in this approach to epistemology is exceeded only by that in\nnaturalizing epistemology and at times the two perspectives are engaged\nsimultaneously (Antony 1993, Duran 1994, Nelson 1990 and 1996, Nelson\nand Nelson 1996, Campbell 1998 and 2003). At first glance the prospect of a\nfeminist epistemology may appear to be a contradiction in terms.\nFeminism is a political movement aimed at eliminating the subordination\nof women to men, while the goal of epistemology is to establish and\ndefend, from a disinterested and impartial point of view, systematic\nstandards for knowledge or justified belief. How can a political\nmovement that is partial regarding the interests of women in relation\nto men be disinterested and impartial? The idea of a feminist\nepistemology, not to say a feminist moral epistemology, may therefore\nappear incomprehensible.\n\n\nFeminists have not been slow to recognize this challenge and have made\na variety of replies. (See Harding 1986 and 1995 for a comparative\nstudy.) Postmodern feminists call into question the concepts of\nknowledge, truth, and impartial justification. Others, however, would\nagree with the assumption of this essay that it is possible to have\nnon-moral knowledge and to offer justifications that adequately\nsupport the truth of non-moral beliefs. They maintain that a feminist\nperspective is able to enhance rather than diminish the accuracy of\nnon-moral beliefs. For example, studies of coronary heart disease were\ncarried out for a long time only on men, based on the belief that the\nresults would apply equally well to women (Mastroianni et\nal. 1994, pp.  64\u201366). In fact, significant differences\nexist, but they came to light only after pressures to broaden the\nstudies. It is agreed on all sides, at this point, that the new\nstudies give a more objective picture of the development of coronary\nheart disease in men and women. Notice, though, that this result is\nentirely compatible with the change in the studies being motivated by\ninterest in women\u2019s health. The conclusion to draw is not that\npolitical motivation is necessarily advantageous for achieving more\nreliable theories but rather that it can be.  Moreover, feminist\nmotivations can lead to the discovery of forms of partiality that have\ndistorted the truth and prevented access to relevant evidence. At a\nstill deeper level, feminists who accept the possibility of knowing\nthe truth have argued that epistemology itself can be transformed\nthrough a better understanding of the ways in which partiality can\nincrease or decrease our chances of knowing the truth.  They have\nargued that it is important to understand how partiality can increase\nor decrease the chances of knowing the truth when the truths in\nquestion concern the subordination of women to men.\n\n\nFeminists who accept the concept of truth are motivated, of course,\nnot simply by the desire to discover the truth about the subordination\nof women (what forms it takes, how it comes about, where it has become\npart of the practice of epistemology). They are also motivated by the\ndesire to stop it. This motivation is justified, most feminists would\nsay, by their knowing that the subordination is unjust and hence\nmorally wrong. At this juncture, one may want to ask how such feminist\nepistemology could create a problem for the possibility of moral\nknowledge. It would seem, on the contrary, that epistemology that is so\nmotivated depends for its rationale on moral knowledge.\n\n\nThe problem is that feminist criticism of knowledge claims that\nreinforce injustice extends to claims of moral knowledge. Some\nexamples may help to clarify this point. Some libertarians have taken\nit to be self-evident that each of us owns his or her own body and\nwhatever is produced through its labor, provided that the goods used\nin the labor are freely and justly acquired so that their acquisition\ndoes not leave others worst off than they were prior to the\nacquisition (Nozick 1974).  This premise is a basic building block for\nsome moral and political theories of justice. Okin (1989) argues,\nhowever, that the premise leads to absurdity when one takes into\naccount the power of women to produce humans through their physical\nlabor, using sperm that they may freely and justly acquire through\npurchase without leaving anyone worst off than before. An absurd\nconsequence of the theory would be that women own their children as\nproperty whom they can dispose of at will.  Not only is this result\nmorally absurd, but there is the further consequence that mothers\nbeing the products of mothers both do and do not own themselves. She\nargues that an inconsistency can also be produced for Rawls\u2019 theory of\njustice, since it is so structured that justice does not apply within\nfamilies yet at the same time the theory requires it to apply there in\norder for justice as fairness to be feasible (Okin 1989). In both\ncases Susan Moller Okin, a feminist moral and political philosopher,\nhas criticized the foundations of a theory of justice by arguing that\nits basic premises are gender-biased in ways that reinforce the\nsubordination of women to men. In one case, gender-bias occurs by\nfailing to count reproductive labor as genuine labor, in the other by\nfailing to recognize how injustice within the family is a major force\nin creating and maintaining the subordination of women to men in the\npublic domain. (For discussion of related problems that arise from the\nquest for impartial moral knowledge when it ignores human embodiment,\nsee Walker 1998, Bach 2012, and Babbitt 2014.)\n\n\nIn order to see how feminist critiques of bias in prominent theories\nof justice lead to paradox, recall the feminist rejection of\nimpartiality as an epistemic ideal. As noted, feminist have defended\nthis rejection by noting that partiality can lead to more accurate\naccounts of reality just as it can lead to distortion and\nmisrepresentation. Partiality that is positive in its results, as in\nthe discovery of the different development of coronary heart disease in\nwomen, should not be rejected. In the heart disease example, however,\nit is possible to ascertain the worthiness of the result independently\nof the bias. Whatever led to the broader study of coronary heart\ndisease, the results of the study can be independently verified by\nfeminist and non-feminists alike. Compare partiality in the moral case.\nIs it possible to know that the resulting feminist theories of justice\nare more objective, less distorting in their representations of justice\nthan the theories under criticism? It may be hard to see how the truth\nof the new feminist theory can be recognized independently of the sense\nof justice that motivated the critique. Does the feminist sense of\njustice constitute a partiality that leads to a more objective, less\ndistorting representation of moral reality? That depends on whether the\njustice in question is identifiable independently of the feminist sense\nof justice. If there is no understanding of true justice that is\nindependent of the partiality that motivates the critique of the\ntraditional theory, then the appeal to true justice appears\nquestion-begging and self-serving.\n\n\nWhat seems to have gone wrong is that feminists are in the position\nof rejecting impartiality as a general epistemic and moral ideal, but\nat the same time they want to reject gender bias because it obviously\nfails to measure up to the ideal of impartiality. Louise Antony has\ncalled this inconsistency \u201cthe bias paradox\u201d (Antony 1993). It is a\nparadox or at least has the appearance of one because there are\nprincipled reasons for rejecting the ideal of complete impartiality.\nNot only are there the reasons already given, but evolutionary reasons\nexist as well for rejecting impartiality. Natural selection has\nequipped us with the means to sort through massive amounts of sensory\ninformation so that we can pick out and interpret quickly information\nrelevant to our survival. Without built-in \u201cbiases\u201d of this nature we\ncould not begin to know anything about the world around us. Yet we also\nwant to reject biases that produce a \u201cbiased\u201d (in a pejorative sense,\ni.e., distorted) representation of the truth. Feminists and\nnon-feminists are in a bind, unless a principled way exists to separate\ngood biases from bad ones. Antony suggests that epistemically good\nbiases are ones that lead to finding out the truth, while epistemically\nbad biases lead away from the truth. Although other epistemologists\nhave suggested that good epistemic standards may be distinguished from\nbad ones by how well they lead to finding out the truth, Antony\u2019s\nproposal is more radical, since she allows political biases to have\npositive epistemic status when they are truth-conducive. But she grants\nthat much work remains to be done to make this resolution clear and\ngenerally acceptable.\n\n\nDoes this suggestion help in averting the threat of circularity that\nwe came upon one paragraph back in reviewing feminist moral critiques\nof gender bias in prominent theories of justice? Arguably it does,\nprovided that we understand moral fact as being independent of our\nopinions about it and our procedures for trying to establish it\n(Campbell 2001). That is, the suggestion helps, provided that moral\nfact is understood either in the realist sense of fact (one not\nreducible to what we can agree upon or what our methods would\ndetermine) or in a sense of objective fact that allows for the\npossibility of massive moral error whatever the efforts to the\ncontrary. At this point we may be inclined to ask whether it is\npossible to know such moral facts? We should remind ourselves,\nhowever, that the main reasons to doubt that we can know moral facts\nare precisely the reasons that we have already examined under the\nheadings above. The objections labeled sociological, psychological,\nontological, evolutionary, and methodological are not aimed against\nknowing moral facts in some non-literal sense of fact, but against\nknowing moral facts in the same sense that we appear to know other\nfacts about the world. If the possible replies that we have canvassed\nare adequate responses to these objections, then it is arguable that\nwe may avert the threat of circularity by Antony\u2019s suggested\nresolution.\n\n\nThis result can be generalized, since it would apply to moral\ncriticisms of impartiality that arise because of concerns about racial\nor class bias. (See Thomas 1992\u20133 for a discussion of the\nimportance of moral deference to the testimony of those in oppressed\ngroups.) If the resolution by appeal to realist fact is successful in\naverting circularity and paradox in the case of gender bias, there is\nno reason why it should not succeed in other cases in which an\nepistemic standard is rejected on other moral grounds. Would the\nresolution be relevant to the moral criticism of other epistemic\nstandards? An example in point would be the criticism by feminists and\nnon-feminists of purely individual-based standards of inquiry,\nespecially in science (Longino 1990, Hardwig 1991, Goldman 1999, and\nKitcher 2011b). Some of these critiques are partly moral, since they\nemphasize the need for democratic values and trust in the context of\nscientific inquiry.  Arguably, they are also motivated by the\nperception that the individual-centered modes of inquiry are at a\ndisadvantage in discovering the facts. (On this last point see the\nsections 7\u201310 to follow.) If we accept the proposed resolution of the\nbias paradox, we could argue that the change in epistemic standards is\njustified on both grounds. In the case where the inquiry is moral\nrather than scientific, can we imagine criticism of epistemic\nstandards other than impartiality? An example might be criticism of\nthe individual-based modes of moral inquiry presupposed in\nintuitionism. As before, we would need a strategy to avert circularity\nand paradox. If the strategy is to stick to a realist or sufficiently\nobjective conception of moral fact, its success will depend on whether\nthe problems canvassed above that confront the possibility of such\nmoral knowledge can be resolved.\n7. Moral Knowledge May Be Possible \u2013 But for Whom?\n\n\nWe have addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten the\npossibility of moral knowledge defined as someone having a justified\ntrue moral belief. For each cluster we have noted avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration. Nonetheless, the problems may\nsuggest that our definition of moral knowledge misrepresents the\ninherently social nature of moral knowledge. Developments in the\ninterdisciplinary literature on the evolution and psychology of\nmorality reinforce this worry.\n\n\nThe psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber challenge the\nassumption that complex knowledge resides in the beliefs of rational\nindividuals (Mercier and Sperber 2017). Countless experiments over\nseveral decades have shown us to be on average very bad at reasoning\non our own. One well-known case is the Wason selection test taken by\nthousands of subjects. In one version subjects have in front of them\nfour cards with a number on one side and a letter on the other. They\nare asked which cards that show E, K, 2, or 7 would they turn over to\ndetermine the truth of the following statement: If a vowel is on one\nside there is an even number on the other. On average only 20% get the\nright answer. If they reason together in small groups, however, their\nsuccess rate jumps to 80%. What accounts for this improvement?\n\n\nMost people, including scientists, are subject to \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\nin that they look for data that are consistent with what they think\nmight be true. Thus if they think the statement in the test is true,\nthey might turn over the \u201c2\u201d card, since doing so cannot help but be\nconsistent with the truth of the statement. What people tend not to\nsearch for is something that could disconfirm their hypothesis, such\nas finding out whether there is a vowel on the other side of card\n\u201c7\u201d. The groups that did well on this test turned over only cards \u201cE\u201d\nand \u201c7\u201d, since these are the only cards that could disconfirm the\ntruth of the statement at issue. Mercier and Sperber suggest that the\npsychological dynamics of reasoning in groups guard against\nconfirmation bias. Each member of a group can have an idea how to\nsolve the problem at issue and put it to the group, but others in the\ngroup will tend to look critically at a proposal from someone else to\nsee if the proposal has a flaw. There is in this way a division of\ncognitive labor within the group. While each member may suffer\nconfirmation bias, as well as other biases, the whole group need not,\nsince each member will try to disconfirm solutions offered by\nothers. The upshot is that the group as a whole will tend to do well,\nunless everyone is biased in exactly the same way. The best groups\ncomprise people who are cognitively diverse but listen well to each\nother.\n\n\nIs there a lesson here for resolving moral problems through social\ninteractive reasoning? Mercier and Sperber cite the abolition of\nslavery by the British Parliament in 1834 after some fifty years of\ndebate at all levels of society. Abolitionists were at first in the\nminority. They asked how Christian moral norms of brotherly love and\nequality before God could be reconciled with enslaving Africans. Those\ndefending slavery retorted that Africans were less intelligent and\nlacked integrity, but these claims were contradicted by the eloquence\nand evident moral character of former slaves who addressed public\nmeetings and by Christian witnesses who had known slaves from personal\nexperience. The economic consequences of abolition were also\ndebated. In the end the majority of public opinion changed through\ndiscussions that permitted careful examination of diverse points of\nview from different parts of society over a long enough period to\nestablish credible evidence about the negative consequences of slavery\ncompared to the likely positive effects of its abolition.\n\n\nThis example suggests that, while people may have moral beliefs that\ninitially few others share, free and interactive reasoning in a\ndiverse group can reveal these moral beliefs to be the better\njustified among the alternatives. Many other examples, such as debates\nabout women\u2019\u2019s right to education or their right to vote,\nconvey the same message. The implication is that moral knowledge, to\nthe extent that it is possible, is more likely to be achieved through\ninteractive reasoning among those with diverse viewpoints who are open\nto criticism from each other.\n8. Moral Knowledge Socially Embodied in Emotions\n\n\nThe philosophical movement of social epistemology supports this\nperspective. It understands knowledge to be primarily a social\nachievement (see entry for Social Epistemology). Moral\nknowledge may be still more deeply social than is generally\nrecognized, even among those who grant that justifying moral beliefs\ninvolves a social process of interactive reasoning within a\ncognitively diverse group. When moral consistency reasoning is part of\nthe social justification process, the reasoning entails efforts to\neliminate emotional inconsistencies in thinking (Campbell and Kumar\n2012). In that case moral knowledge, if it were achieved, would be\nembodied not only in the beliefs of those seeking knowledge, but also\nin their motivations and feelings. Indeed, given the cognitive basis\nof moral emotions, it is possible for a society to know through their\nfeelings of guilt that they have done morally wrong even when they\nbelieve otherwise for ideological reasons, parallel to the case of the\nwomen who cannot shake her feelings of resentment for being unfairly\npassed over for promotion in favour of a male colleague when she\nbelieves her feelings cannot justified given the lesser social status\nof women (Campbell 2007).\n9. Epistemological Exclusion\n\n\nNew research on moral evolution accords with the above social view of\nmoral knowledge. Michael Tomasello (2016) makes the case that human\nmoral norms have their origin in the phenomenon of \u201cshared\nintentionality\u201d that binds diverse individuals to a common project in\nwhich they see each other as equal partners. When moral norms conflict\neach person in a group that is motivated by these norms is an equal\npartner in the shared project of resolving the moral conflict. If\nmorality is a shared project in this way, the cost of excluding some\npersons from the process of resolving moral conflict can be\nsignificant. Such exclusion can undermine achieving moral knowledge\nthat depends on input from diverse individuals acting as equals.\n\n\nThis understanding of moral knowledge reflects moral concerns of many\nfeminists. For example, Miranda Fricker (2007) examines the \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d of being wrongfully denied recognition as a potential\nknower due to one\u2019s race, gender, or other identity. See also\nKristie Dotson (2011) on the epistemic injustice of silencing caused\nby violence against women. Other feminists point out that non-moral\nknowledge claims can be unfairly biased when they are based only on\nexperience of men or neglect the social structures that unjustly bias\nthe perception of causation. For example, it is sometimes thought that\nthe burden of childrearing is biologically determined. Sarah Baffer\nHrdy (2009), however, offer a new evolutionary perspective on the\nshared responsibility for childcare among early humans. Cordelia Fine\n(2017) challenges the familiar view that gender roles are hormonally\ndetermined. Kate Manne (2018) shows how patriarchy tends to undermine\nsocially our ability to reason freely about gender\ndiscrimination. Even when reasoning is conceived explicitly as being\nsocial and equal, as in social contract theory, the moral upshot of\nreasoning can reflect racial bias when reasoning is abstracted from\nactual social context (Charles Mills 2017) or when the causal effects\nof social structures, like de facto segregation, are ignored\n(Elizabeth Anderson 2010).\n\n10. The Six Clusters of Problems: Any Progress?\n\n\nHow do these considerations bear on the possibility of moral\nknowledge? In particular, does a group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge that is based on social interactive reasoning help to\naddress the six main clusters of problems raised earlier about the\npossibility of moral knowledge? My answer is positive but\nqualified. Consider the clusters of problems in order.\n\n\nThe first cluster concerns the sociological reality of moral\ndisagreement. Obviously the group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge does not eliminate differences in moral outlook, but it may\nalter how we should think about these differences. I said early on\nthat I would assume that we have knowledge of some non-moral\ntruths. An example would be knowledge that the Earth is round rather\nthan flat. There are pockets of people who still believe that the\nEarth is flat. Should most remain confident in knowing that the Earth\nis round? The reason they should is the social interactive reasoning\nabout the issue over centuries from diverse perspectives leading to\nnear universal agreement. Can a similar conclusion be drawn in certain\nimportant cases of moral agreement, for example, about moral\nprogress?\n\n\nAllen Buchanan and Russell Powell (2018) cite ten examples of moral\nprogress. Among them are these four: \u201c\u2026the large reduction,\nbeginning with the British abolition, of the incidence of the most\nextreme forms of slavery\u2026the increasing recognition and\ninstitutionalization of the equal rights of women in some countries,\nbetter treatment of some non-human animals, abolition of at least the\ncruellest punishments\u201d (p. 47). While not everyone would agree even\nwith these examples, there exists, parallel to the non-moral case,\nextremely broad agreement among diverse groups who have reasoned\nfreely and interactively over extended periods. As Buchanan and Powell\nmake clear, moral progress in such cases goes hand in hand with moral\nregress in many areas and unresolved deep moral differences about\nother issues. On the other hand, if what is in question is the bare\npossibility of moral knowledge, a positive answer seems warranted.\n\n\nThe second, psychological cluster of problems focuses on the dual\nfunction of moral judgment as motivation and belief. The problem is\nhow a judgment can be both at once. A resolution that we examined is\nthat moral judgment can be a hybrid of the two states. That suggestion\nis much easier to defend for moral knowledge when it is embodied in a\ngroup of individuals who have distinct beliefs and motivations. The\ngroup as a whole is motivated by a collection of internalized moral\nnorms that the group believes to be justified. Even if no mental state\nof an individual in a group performs both functions at once, the group\nas a whole can serve both functions of belief and motivation as they\nare differently embodied in the mental states of its members.\n\n\nThe ontological cluster is a different matter. While the subjective\npart of knowledge shifts from individual judgment to the\ninternalization of norms within the group and a reasoned consensus\nthat the norms are justified, the reality that the knowledge is about\nremains a difficult issue: Is moral truth to be treated as\ntheological, non-natural, or natural? There is, however, a subtle\ndifference. The truth in question is about whether the emotionally\nembodied norms can withstand the scrutiny of the whole group under\nsustained interactive reasoning in light of relevant non-moral\nknowledge. Some will complain that such rendering of the object of\nmoral knowledge is too subjective, since it turns moral knowledge into\na form of group self-knowledge. A similar worry was noted when we\ndiscussed group-based justification (Copp 1995) and pragmatic\nnaturalism (Kitcher 2011). We should concede that such worries need to\nbe answered.\n\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth clusters concerning evolutionary,\nmethodological, and moral problems are easier to address, since the\nnew understanding of moral knowledge is based on (a) current knowledge\nof evolution, (b) the methodologies of (i) naturalized epistemology,\n(ii) reflective equilibrium when expanded to include moral consistency\nreasoning (Campbell 2014, 2017), and (iii) pragmatic naturalism, and\n(c) moral concerns raised by feminists. When moral knowledge is\ninterpreted to be consistent with psychological and evolutionary\nstudies of morality, these studies and the methodologies listed tend\nto reinforce the group-centered conception of moral knowledge. Issues\nwill remain, such as the ontological one just noted, but on balance\nthe problems for moral knowledge are diminished. The moral problems of\nbias raised in feminist epistemology are no exception, since the\nfeminist literature cited above emphasizes the social nature of moral\nknowledge. That said, resolution of the bias paradox in feminist\nepistemology may require a realist moral ontology (as noted in section\n6) and it may be unclear how to provide it. Our view that moral\nknowledge is possible is therefore qualified.\n11. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten\nthe possibility of moral knowledge. Subject to the constraints noted\nat the outset, the aim has been to examine these problems with an eye\nto their complexity, especially their mutual ramifications, and to\nexplore avenues of possible resolution that are evident in the\nphilosophical and interdisciplinary literature. From this survey, we\ncan see that for each cluster of problems there are avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration, especially given\ninterdisciplinary research implying that moral knowledge is deeply\nsocial.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allman, John and James Woodward, 2008, \u201cWhat Are Moral\nIntuitions and Why Should We Care about Them?
