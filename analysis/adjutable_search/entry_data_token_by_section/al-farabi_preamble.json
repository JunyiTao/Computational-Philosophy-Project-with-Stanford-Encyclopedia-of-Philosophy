Ab\u00fb Nasr\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee was probably born in 870 CE (AH 257) in a\nplace called Farab or Farayb. In his youth he moved to Iraq and\nBaghdad. In 943 CE (AH 331) he went to Syria and Damascus. He may have\ngone to Egypt but died in Damascus in December 950 CE or January 951\nCE (AH 339). Scholars have disputed his ethnic origin. Some claimed he\nwas Turkish but more recent research points to him being a\nPersian (Rudolph 2017: 536\u201345). \n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee had two main interests:\n\nPhilosophy and logic in particular. Such interest explains why he\nis known as \u201cthe second master\u201d (the first one, of course,\nbeing Aristotle) and\nMusic. His huge Kit\u00e2b al-musiq\u00e2\nal-kab\u00eer or Great Book of Music is the most\nimportant medieval musical treatise in Islamic lands and also includes\nsophisticated philosophical sections.\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, much has happened in Farabian scholarship. New\nand better editions of his works as well as new and better\ntranslations have led to deeper studies of his thought and to some\ninteresting and lively controversies. More current bibliographies\nallow for more detailed research. We still lack critical editions,\nfull English translations\u2014and even, at times, translation in any\nlanguage of several texts\u2014as well as a solid introduction to\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s philosophy. More research is also\nneeded to better understand the relation between his philosophical and\nmusical interests.\n\nOne can find the most recent and detailed listings of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works and their translations in\nUlrich Rudolph, \u201cAb\u00fb Nasr\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u201d (2017: 526\u2013594), and Philippe\nVallat (2004: 379\u201387). Also, Jon McGinnis & David. C.  Reisman\ntranslated a series of Farabian texts in their Classical Arabic\nPhilosophy: An Anthology of Sources (2007: 54\u2013120).\n",
