    "main_text": "Kinds of temporal experience\n2. Kinds of temporal experience\n\nThere are a number of what Ernst P\u00f6ppel (1978) calls\n\u2018elementary time experiences\u2019, or fundamental aspects of\nour experience of time. Among these we may list the experience of (i)\nduration; (ii) non-simultaneity; (iii) order; (iv) past and present;\n(v) change, including the passage of time. It might be thought that\nexperience of non-simultaneity is the same as experience of time\norder, but it appears that, when two events occur very close together\nin time, we can be aware that they occur at different times without\nbeing able to say which one came first (see Hirsh and Sherrick 1961).\nWe might also think that perception of order was itself explicable in\nterms of our experience of the distinction between past and present.\nThere will certainly be links here, but it is a contentious question\nwhether the experience of tense\u2014that is, experiencing\nan event as past or present\u2014is more fundamental than the\nexperience of order, or vice versa, or whether indeed there is such a\nthing as the experience of tense at all. This issue is taken up below.\nFinally, we should expect to see links between the perception of time\norder and the perception of motion if the latter simply involves\nperception of the order of the different spatial positions of an\nobject. This is another contentious issue that is taken up below.\n",
