    "main_text": "Is Consciousness Unified? || Skepticism about Unity\n3.1 Skepticism about Unity\n\nMany philosophers have been sceptical about whether consciousness is\nunified. It is possible to be sceptical about whether all\nconsciousness is unified, whether as many conscious states are unified\nas we might think, and, the strongest form of scepticism here, whether\nthere is any unity of consciousness. Let us examine the three in\nreverse order.\n\nHume ([1739] 1962: 252) seems to have been an example of the strongest\nform of scepticism. He famously doubted, or tried to doubt, that we\nhave unified consciousness even of the self, let alone of one\u2019s\nconscious states. Among recent writers, perhaps the most sceptical\nabout consciousness being unified is Rosenthal. Rosenthal holds that\nall we have is a \u201csense of the unity of\nconsciousness\u201d (1986: 344, emphasis added). Why merely a sense?\nOn his view, \n\n\nMental states are conscious, when they are, in virtue of their being\naccompanied by HOTs [higher-order thoughts] and each HOT represents\nits target as belonging to the individual who also thinks the HOT in\nquestion. (Rosenthal 2002: 15) \n\n\nAcross a range of such self-ascriptions, one develops a sense of being\ntheir common subject. However, this sense could be wrong. The\nexperiences thus ascribed, says Rosenthal, could be supported by or\nlocated in a diversity of subjects. It is because of this possibility\nthat Rosenthal asserts that all we have is a sense of consciousness\nbeing unified. \n\nEven when theorists such as Hume and Rosenthal deny that consciousness\nis unified, sometimes unity of some sort still seems to be at work in\ntheir models. Rosenthal says, for example, \u201cA mental state is\nconscious just in case it is accompanied by a \u2026 thought to the\neffect that one is in the state in question\u201d (2003:\n325, our emphasis). If so, in addition to a HOT being about another\npsychological state, it is also about oneself, the thing that has the\nstate (\u2018that one\u00a0is in the state in\nquestion\u2019). Now, this consciousness of oneself is not\nconsciousness of any old object, it is consciousness of oneself,\noneself as the bearer of conscious states. But this is consciousness\nof oneself as, to use Kant\u2019s phrase, the single common subject\nof one\u2019s experience (1781/7, A350). If so, Rosenthal allows that\none kind of unified consciousness exists despite himself. \n\nMore recently, Nagel (1971), Davidson (1980), Dennett (1991, 1992),\nO\u2019Brien and Opie (1998), and Rosenthal (2003) have all urged in\none way or another that the mind\u2019s unity has been overstated.\nThe point these people make is not just that the mind works mostly out\nof the sight and often out of the control of consciousness. Virtually\neveryone agrees on that and the point would in no way tell against\nthere being a real unity of some kind in the part that does enter\nconsciousness. Rather, they maintain that not even all conscious\nstates are unified with other conscious states. \n\nNote that the claim here is not just that we are conscious of less of\nthe contents of our mind than we think, as Freud and the\npsychoanalytic tradition argue. The claim is that our consciousness of\neven many states of which we are conscious is not, or not fully,\nunified. That we act against what we clearly know to be our own most\ndesired course of action or do things while telling ourselves that we\nmust avoid doing them are advanced as reasons for holding the view but\nthese are not obvious examples of lack of unity. A change blindness\nexperiment might offer a more substantial example.\n\nIn this experiment, a subject sits in front of a computer screen\nwearing an eye tracker visor. There is a paragraph of text on the\nscreen. The subject is asked to read the text. When subject\u2019s\neyes are focused on a particular word or phrase, the bit of text is as\nit should be. However, everything around the word or phrase at\nfixation, everything above, below and on both sides, beyond about 5\ndegrees of arc is chaotic: gibberish, out of order words, shapes\nvaguely like words but obviously not words, and so on. Each time the\nsubject\u2019s eyes shift to a new bit of text, it pops into correct\nform just before the eyes get to it and the word or phrase just left\ngoes strange. What is remarkable about this experiment is that, while\nto observers all appears chaotic except for a succession of words or\nphrases\u2014they are marching to a different saccadic\ndrummer\u2014the subject has no consciousness that anything in the\nparagraph is ever out of the ordinary. If the subject is one of those\npeople who automatically reads any text in front of her, often she has\nno idea that the experiment has even started!\n\nWhat this experiment shows, Dennett (1991: 361\u2013362) thinks, is\nthat we take only a tiny, central bit of the scene in front of us\nfully into unified consciousness. Yet subjects are conscious of the\nrest of the screen in some ways. They are aware of movement, for\nexample. If so, this experiment would be an example of conscious\nstates that are not fully taken up into unified consciousness. We\nwould have unified consciousness of fewer of our conscious states than\nhas been thought.\n\nNote that the argument just examined is not an argument that unified\nconsciousness does not exist. Even if we have conscious states that\nare not unified or fully unified in consciousness, the most that that\ncould force us to do would be to shrink the range of states over which\nconsciousness is unified or fully unified. From the fact that not all\nof one\u2019s conscious contents are unified, it does not follow that\nnone is. \n\nIndeed, those who hold that the extent to which consciousness is\nunified has been overstated owe us an account of what has\nbeen overstated. When theorists claim that a some conscious states are\nnot in unified consciousness, we should ask: Not unified with what?\nOne plausible answer would be: The unified conscious mind. Here is one\nway to view the matter. Once upon a time, some theorists held that all\nconscious states are unified and indeed that all mental states are\nconscious. As we saw, Brentano is an example. (We will return to this\nview in the next Section.) The main difference between this\npre-twentieth century vision of unified consciousness as ranging over\neverything in the mind and view we just examined is that on the latter\nview, less of consciousness is unified than the earlier view held.\n\nDennett is interesting in this regard. As we saw, he can plausibly be\nread as rejecting the traditional picture of unified consciousness.\nYet he can still invoke unity. He says, \u201cWhat is it like to be\nan ant colony? Nothing, I submit \u2026 What is it like to be a\nbrace of oxen? Nothing (even if it is like something to be a single\nox)\u201d (Dennett 2005). Why is the answer nothing? In such cases,\n\u201cthere is no functional unity \u2026\u2014no unity to\ndistinguish an I from a we\u201d (Dennett 2005).\n\n\nTo sum up the discussion of scepticism about unified consciousness so\nfar, the argument that the unity of consciousness is real, indeed is a\ncentral feature of our kind of mind, seems to be strong.\n",
