    "main_text": "Do Types Exist? || Nominalism\n7.3 Nominalism\n\n\nRealism is not without its problems, as was noted in \u00a75\nabove. Also favoring nominalism is Occam's principle which would have\nus prefer theories with fewer sorts of entities, other things being\nequal.  The main problem for nominalists is to account for our\napparent theoretical commitment to types, which, whatever types are,\nare not spatio-temporal particulars (according to nearly\neveryone). Traditional nominalists argued (as their name implies) that\nthere are no general things, there are only general words,\nand such words simply apply to more than one thing. But this is not a\nsolution to the current problem, presupposing as it does that there\nare word types\u2014types are the problem. (Attempts to avoid this\nare given by Goodman and by Sellars; see below.) So-called class\nnominalists hold that a word type is just the class, or set, of its\ntokens. But this is unsatisfactory because, first, as we saw in\n\u00a75, classes are ill-suited for the job, since classes have their\nmembership and their cardinality necessarily, but how many tokens a\ntype has is usually a contingent matter. (For the same reason,\nmereological sums of tokens are unsuited for the job of types, as they\nhave their parts essentially.) And second, classes are\nabstract objects too, so it is hard to see how this is really a form\nof nominalism about abstract objects at all.\n\n\nInitially more promising is the nominalistic claim that the surface\ngrammar of type talk is misleading, that talk of types is just\nshorthand for talk of tokens and is thus harmless. To say \u2018The\nhorse is a mammal\u2019 is just to say \u2018All horses are\nmammals\u2019; to say \u2018The horse is a four-legged animal\u2019\nis to say, as Frege himself (1977) suggested, \u2018All properly\nconstituted horses are four-legged animals\u2019. The idea is to\n\u201canalyze away\u201d apparent references to types by offering\ntranslations that are apparently type-free, and otherwise\nnominalistically acceptable. The problem is how to do this for each\nand every reference to or quantification over a type/types. Given the\nubiquity of such references/quantifications, only the procurement of\nsome sort of systematic procedure could assure us it can be done.\nHowever, chances of formulating a systematic procedure appear slight,\nin view of the following obstacles that would have to be overcome.\n\nIf the \u201ctranslation\u201d is not to turn out to be\ntrivially true because there are no tokens, it must be the case that\nall types have tokens. We saw in \u00a75 there is reason to deny this,\nbecause it would falsify the law of syntax that says that if\n\u03a6,\u03a8 are sentences, then so is (\u03a6 & \u03a8), since there\nare only finitely many sentence tokens.\nThe examples of \u2018The horse is a mammal\u2019 and \u2018The\nhorse is four-legged\u2019 suggest that \u2018The Type is P\u2019\nis to be analyzed as \u2018All tokens, or all normal tokens, are\nP\u2019. But this won't work. The noun \u2018colour\u2019 is\nspelled \u2018color\u2019 (among other ways) , but not all properly\nformed tokens of it are. \u2018Colour\u2019 also means of the\nface or skin (among other things), but not only do not all tokens\nof it mean of the face or skin, probably most do not, and the\naverage one does not.\nThese semantic facts show that \u2018The Type is P\u2019 cannot\nbe analyzed as \u2018Either all tokens are P, all properly formed\ntokens are P, most tokens are P or the average token is P\u2019. Nor\nis there any point in searching for some other magic statistical\nformula that would express exactly how many tokens have to be\nP for the Type to be P. This is because some of the properties of the\nType are collective properties\u2014e.g., when it is said that\n\u201cThe grizzly bear, Ursus Horribilis, had at one time a\nU.S. range of most of the West, and numbered 10,000 is California\nalone, but today its range is Montana, Wyoming and Idaho and it\nnumbers less than 1000.\u201d Having a range of most of the West is\ntrue of no individual bear.\nIt is very difficult even to find a nominalistic paraphrase for\n\u201cOld Glory had twenty-eight stars in 1846 but now has\nfifty\u201d, as Wetzel (2008) argues.\nSo far we have only been considering analyzing away singular\nterms. Quantifications are indeed a nightmare. Here is Quine and\nGoodman's (1947 p. 180) nominalized version of \u201cThere are more\ncats than dogs\u201d: \u201cEvery individual that contains a bit of\neach cat is bigger than some individual that contains a bit of each\ndog\u201d where a bit \u201cis an object that is just as big as the\nsmallest animal among all cats and dogs\u201d. Ingenious though their\nstrategy is, it offers no help for nominalizing \u201cOf 20,481\nspecies examined, two-thirds were secure, seven percent were\ncritically imperiled, and fifteen percent were vulnerable\u201d.\n\n7.3.1 Goodman's Nominalism\n\n\nI have been writing as though it were easy to pick out and quantify\nover tokens of a type without referring to the type. Sometimes it is:\n\u2018The horse\u2026\u2019\u2014 \u2018All\nhorses\u2026\u2019. But this will not generally be the\ncase. Consider the noun \u2018color\u2019. The natural way to pick\nout its tokens is \u201call tokens of the noun\n\u2018color\u2019\u201d, but obviously this will not do as a\nnominalistic paraphrase, for it contains a reference to a\ntype. Goodman (1977) suggests a systematic way of paraphrasing and a\ngeneral procedure for substituting nominalistic paraphrases for\nlinguistic type-ridden sentences. In 1977 (p. 262) he claims that\n\u201cany \u201c \u2018Paris\u2019 consists of five letters\u201d\nis short for \u201cEvery \u2018Paris\u2019-inscription consists of\nfive letter-inscriptions\u201d \u201d. The idea seems to be to\nreplace singular terms by predicates, which nominalists such as\nGoodman think carry no ontological commitment. So instead of \u201can\ninscription of \u2018color\u2019\u201d write \u201ca\n\u2018color\u2019-inscription.\u201d It seems pretty clear,\nhowever, that, based on the rules of quote-names for words, this\npredicate still retains a singular term for a type, the word\n\u2018color\u2019 just as clearly as \u201ca George W. Bush\nappearance\u201d still contains a reference to Bush. That this is so\nis even more obvious in the case of \u201can \u2018a cat is on the\nmat\u2019-inscription\u201d. So the question is how we might\nidentify these tokens grammatically but without referring to the noun\n\u2018color\u2019 itself and still say something true and (in some\nappropriate sense) equivalent. Is there perhaps some other way of\nquantifying over tokens of a word, without referring to the word or to\nany other type? The fact that tokens are all \u201cthe same\ntype\u201d suggests they are all \u201cthe same\u201d somehow,\nwhich begets the idea that the type must embody certain\nsimilar features that all and only its tokens have, such as\nspelling, or sense, or phonological structure or some combination of\nthem. This is a beguiling idea, until one tries to find such a\nfeature, or features, amid the large variety of its tokens\u2014even\nthe well-formed tokens. As we saw in \u00a74, there is no such feature\n(consider again \u2018color\u2019 and \u2018schedule\u2019). They\ndemonstrate that e.g. neither same spelling, same sense, nor same\npronunciation prevail. In any event, such possible defining features\ninvolve reference to types: letter types in the spellings, phoneme\ntypes in the pronunciation. These too would have to be \u201canalyzed\naway\u201d in terms of quantifications over particulars. It might be\nthought that Sellars solved this problem by appealing to the notion of\na linguistic role, which Loux (1998, p. 79) defines as:\ntwo word (tokens) have the same linguistic role if they\n\u201cfunction in the same way as responses to perceptual input; they\nenter into the same inference patterns; and they play the same role in\nguiding behavior\u201d. It is dubious whether this notion can be\nunpacked without referring to abstract objects (same inference\npatterns?), but in any event it cannot be used to pick out all tokens\nof a word, as we have been using the word \u2018word\u2019. The\nreason is that \u2018red\u2019 and \u2018rouge\u2019 are different\nwords in our sense, but their tokens play the same linguistic role for\nSellars.\n\n\nBut even if expressions like \u201ca\n\u2018color\u2019-inscription\u201d did not contain singular terms,\nGoodman's suggestion that whatever is true of the type is true of all\nthe tokens has two fatal defects. First, it would turn truths into\nfalsehoods. \u2018Paris\u2019 consists of five letters, as does\n\u2018color\u2019, but not every \u2018color\u2019-inscription\nconsists of just five letter-inscriptions since some are spelled\n\u2018c\u2019-\u2018o\u2019-\u2018l\u2019-\u2018o\u2019-\u2018u\u2019-\u2018r\u2019.\n(As for denying that these are inscriptions of the word\n\u2018color\u2019 see \u201cOrthography\u201d in \u00a74 above.)\nIt doesn't even work for the word \u2018Paris\u2019, as it has the\nforms \u2018Pareiss\u2019 and \u2018Parrys\u2019 also. Second,\nGoodman's technique of replacing singular terms by predicates only\nworks if we are employing a realist semantics. That is, the key to his\nprogram is that for every word in the dictionary and every sentence in\nthe language there corresponds a unique predicate that is true of just\nthe tokens of that word/that sentence. (Without such predicates, true\nstatements apparently referring to types would be short for nothing at\nall.) But this is only plausible on a realist semantics. If\n\u2018predicate\u2019 meant \u2018predicate token\u2019 there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. That is, it is certainly\nfalse that for every word \u03b1 in the dictionary, there is an\nactual predicate token of the form \u2018is an\n\u03b1-inscription\u2019.  For more details on the problems with\nGoodman's strategy, see Wetzel (2000).\n7.3.2 Sellars's nominalism\n\n\nSellars's suggestion is rather similar to Goodman's, and faces similar\ndifficulties, but is sufficiently different to be worth\nmentioning. Loux (1998, pp. 75-83), for one, argues that Sellars\n(1963) achieves the best nominalist account available by overcoming\ncritical objections to Carnap's \u201cmetalinguistic\u201d account\nas follows. Carnap (1959, pp. 284-314) had suggested that all claims\ninvolving apparent reference to abstract objects, such as \u201cRed\nis a color\u201d, are systematically to be understood as\nmetalinguistic claims about the word involved (\u201cThe word\n\u2018red\u2019 is a color predicate\u201d). There are two obvious\nobjections to Carnap's suggestion. The first is that we still have\nword types being referred to; the second is that translation of\n\u201cRed is a color\u201d and \u201cThe word \u2018red\u2019 is\na color predicate\u201d into French, say, will not result in\nsentences that are equivalent, since the latter (\u201cLe mot\n\u2018red\u2019 est un pr\u00e9dicat de coleur\u201d) will still\nrefer to an English word, but the former will not. To counter the\nfirst objection, Sellars (1963, pp. 632-33) claims \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d is a distributive singular term,\nwhich typically consists of \u2018the\u2019 followed by a common\nnoun that purports to name a kind\u2014e.g., \u2018the lion\u2019\nin \u201cThe lion is tawny\u201d\u2014and that use of it results in\na generic claim that is about token lions, not the\ntype\u2014\u201cAll lions are tawny\u201d\u2014since \u201cThe K\nis f\u201d is logically equivalent to \u201cAll Ks are\nf\u201d. Note that this is similar to Goodman's suggestion and as\nsuch is subject to the same criticism as is Goodman's: the two\nsentence forms said to be logically equivalent are not. See the second\nbullet point three paragraphs above.  Nor is there some other simple\nand straightforward logical equivalence that does the job; see the\nthird and fourth bullet points above. At best this is a suggestion\nthat some of the sentences in question\u2014the ones that do not\ncontain \u201ccollective\u201d predicates like\n\u2018extinct\u2019\u2014are logically equivalent to generic\nclaims\u2014e.g. \u201cLions are tawny\u201d\u2014which are\ncapable of being true while admitting of exceptions. However, that\nthere is a uniform semantics (even a very complex one) for generic\nclaims, one moreover that \u201canalyzes away\u201d kind talk, is a\nstrong empirical claim about language, one that does not receive\nstrong support from current efforts to analyze generic claims. (See\nCarlson and Pelletier 1995.)\n\n\nTo counter the second objection (about non-equivalent translations)\nSellars suggests we introduce a new sort of quotation device, dot\nquotation, that would permit translation of the quoted word. Then,\ne.g.  \u201cThe word \u2022red\u2022 is a color predicate\u201d\ntranslates as \u201cLe mot \u2022rouge\u2022 est un pr\u00e9dicat\nde coleur\u201d. The justification is that \u2018red\u2019 and\n\u2018rouge\u2019 are functionally equivalent\u2014they play the\nsame linguistic role. As mentioned above, this means that they have\nthe same causes (of perceptual stimuli, e.g.) and effects (conduct,\ne.g.) and function similarly in inferential transitions. Again,\nwhether Sellars can unpack the notion of \u201csame linguistic\nrole\u201d without appealing to any universals remains an open\nquestion. Less open is the question of how successful such an approach\nis to dealing with talk of words, e.g., \u201cThe word\n\u2018red\u2019 consists of three letters\u201d. If we apply\nSellars' analysis systematically, this becomes \u201c\u201dThe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d consists of a three-lettered predicate\u201d\nwhich is just false; if instead we reckon that \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d is already a distributive singular term and\napply his analysis to it, getting \u201cThe word \u2022red\u2022 is a\nthree-lettered predicate\u201d, this then translates incorrectly as\n\u201cLe mot \u2022rouge\u2022 est un pr\u00e9dicat trois-en\nlettres\u201d. If we stick instead with regular quotation, which\nresists translation, then we cannot appeal to \u201csame linguistic\nrole\u201d to say what class of things \u201cthe word\n\u2018red\u2019\u201d distributes over. In any event, Sellars's\naccount also faces the difficulty noted above with Goodman's account:\nit is only plausible on a realist semantics, because if\n\u2018predicate\u2019 meant \u2018predicate token\u2019 there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. (For other problems with\nSellars's account, see Loux 1978: 81-85.)\n8. Occurrences\n\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a71 above, there is a related distinction that\nneeds to be mentioned in connection with the type-token\ndistinction. It is that between a thing, or type of thing, and (what\nis best called) an occurrence of it\u2014where an occurrence\nis not necessarily a token. The reason the reader was asked above to\ncount the words in Stein's line in front of the reader's\neyes, was to ensure that tokens would be counted. Tokens are\nconcrete particulars; whether objects or events they have a unique\nspatio-temporal location.  Had the reader been asked to count the\nwords in Stein's line itself, the reader might still have correctly\nanswered either \u2018three\u2019 or \u2018ten\u2019. There are\nexactly three word types, but although there are ten word tokens in a\ntoken copy of the line, there aren't any tokens at all in the line\nitself. The line itself is an abstract type, as is the poem in which\nit first appeared.  Nor are there ten word types in the line, because\nas we just said it contains only the three word types,\n\u2018a,\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018rose,\u2019 each of\nwhich is unique. So what are there ten of? Occurrences of\nwords, as logicians say: three occurrences of the word (type)\n\u2018a,\u2019 three of \u2018is\u2019 and four of\n\u2018rose\u2019. Or, to put it in a more ontologically neutral\nfashion: the word \u2018a\u2019 occurs three times in the line,\n\u2018is\u2019 three times and \u2018rose\u2019 four times.\nSimilarly, the variable \u2018x\u2019 occurs three times in the\nformula \u2018\u2203x (Ax & Bx)\u2019.\n\n\nNow this may seem impossible; how can one and the same thing occur\nmore than once without there being two tokens of it? Simons (1982)\nconcludes that it can't. Wetzel (1993) argues that it is useful to\ndistinguish objects from occurrences of them. For example, in the\nsequence of numbers <0,1,0,1> the very same number, the number\none, occurs twice, yet its first occurrence is distinct from its\nsecond. The notion of an occurrence of x in y involves not\nonly x and y, but also how x is situated in y. Even a\nconcrete object can occur more than once in a\nsequence\u2014the same person occurs twice in the sequence of New\nJersey million dollar lottery winners, remarkably enough. If we think\nof an expression as a sequence, then the air of mystery over\nhow the same identical thing can occur twice vanishes. Does this mean\nthat, in addition to word types and word tokens, word occurrences must\nalso be recognized? Not necessarily; we can unpack the notion of an\noccurrence using \u201coccurs in\u201d if we have the notion of a\nsequence available; see Wetzel 1993 for details.\n\n\nThe need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types\narises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have\nother types of things occurring in them. There are 10,000 (or so)\nnotes in Beethoven's Sonate Path\u00e9tique, but there are\nonly 88 notes (types) the piano can produce. There are supposed to be\nfifty stars (types) in the current Old Glory (type), but the\nfive-pointed star (type) is unique. And what could it mean to say that\nthe very same atom (type), hydrogen, \u201coccurs four times\u201d\nin the methane molecule? Again, the perplexing thing is how the very\nsame thing can \u201coccur\u201d more than once, without there being\nmore than one token of it. Armstrong (1986), Lewis (1986a,b) and\nForrest (1986) called such types \u201cstructural universals\u201d,\nwhich were the subject of a debate among the three. Armstrong and\nForrest defended Armstrong's (1978) view of universals against Lewis,\nwho delineated seven different views of structural universals\ncompatible with Armstrong's theory, and found all of them wanting.\nBasically, Lewis (1986a) assumed that there are two sorts of ways\nstructural universals might be constructed of simpler universals:\nset-theoretically and mereologically. He argued that set-theoretical\nconstructions resulted in ersatz universals, not universals worthy of\nthe name, and that the various mereological constructions just\nresulted in a heap of simpler universals, where there could not be\ntwo of the simpler universals. Wetzel (2008) argues that\nthere is a conception of a structural universal, the \u201coccurrence\nconception\u201d\u2014which is an extension of the occurrence\nconception of expressions mentioned above\u2014that escapes Lewis's\nobjections.",
