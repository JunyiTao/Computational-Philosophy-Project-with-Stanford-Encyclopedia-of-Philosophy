    "main_text": "Women\u2019s emancipation\n7. Influence and legacy\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg\u2019s ideas are still relevant today because they\nbelong to a tradition of socialist thinking whose main concern is with\nfreedom, its development in the course of global history, the\nobstacles to its realisation, and the different types of oppression\nthat capitalist society entrenches, enables or fails to\nabolish. Luxemburg\u2019s analysis of freedom as a philosophical\nconcept is never explicitly brought out in her writings, but often\nappears embedded in a notion of historical agency \u2013 both\nindividual and collective \u2013 which shares the humanism of\nclassical Marxism. Socialism, Luxemburg argued, \u201cis the first\npopular movement in the world that has set itself a goal and has\nestablished in the social life of a human being a conscious thought, a\ndefinite plan, the free will of mankind\u201d (Luxemburg 1915 [RLR:\n320]).\n\n\nFor her, as for Marx and others before him, human beings have a unique\nmoral authority grounded on freedom which provides the basis for a\nradical critique of existing capitalist institutions as well as the\nimpetus to struggle for a genuinly free society. Capitalism hinders\nfreedom because it establishes global patterns of domination and\noppression which sacrifice the freedom of many to the wellbeing of a\nfew. Crucially for Luxemburg though, freedom is not simply an\nend-state, a condition to aspire to at the end of a journey of\npolitical emancipation; it is also actively practiced when those who\nsuffer from injustice express their will through forms of political\nactivism that play an educating role. In this sense, the process of\npolitical emancipation must be self-guided rather than directed by\nothers because the experience accumulated through political practice\nserves as a learning platform in which collective freedom, before\nbeing instutionalised externally through political and legal\nmechanisms, is appropriated internally and exercised through social\nactivism.\n\n\nWhile Luxemburg\u2019s writings are scattered\nand sometimes difficult to read, this commitment to freedom provides\nthe moral and political compass with the help of which we can\nunderstand her contribution to a range of questions: from the limits of\nliberal parliamentarism to the value of self determination, from the\ndynamics of global capital accumulation to the persistence of\nimperialism, from the problem of political organisation to the issue of\nrevolutionary transition. Although like many Marxists of her\ngeneration, Luxemburg was less interested in abstract theoretical\nanalysis and more in how to deploy that analysis as a tool for\npolitical change, her reflections remain a crucial starting point to\ndevelop critical thinking in at least three domains. Firstly, there is\nthe question of how to think about political power in the context of a\nglobal capitalist structure facing continuous crisis, and where the\nburdens of that crisis are distributed disproportionally on oppressed\ngroups of people whose different identities do not neatly overlap with\nthe boundaries between nation states. Luxemburg\u2019s remarks on\nimperialism and capitalist accumulation offer a productive starting\npoint to think about social justice in a way that is historically\nnuanced, sensitive to the development of global capitalism and\nthat escapes the methodological nationalist straightjacket that often\ncharacterises liberal thinking on unequal development. The second is\nthe question of political organisation, the relevance of education, and\nthe costs of transition from one system of laws to another. Here\nLuxemburg\u2019s analysis is useful to think about the ethics of\nrevolution and to orient the debate about how to learn from the trials\nand failures of progressive movements of the past in a way that\ncombines radical commitments with awareness of the necessity of\ncompromise. Finally, her writings are crucial to alert us to different\nforms of oppression that still afflict our world, and to think about\nthem in an intersectional way that brings together the concerns of\ngender, race and class. They enable us to articulate a richer analysis\nof the capitalist system which is genuinely inclusive of the history,\ntheory and practice of oppressed groups of people in different parts of\nthe globe and that tries to unify these concerns instead of isolating\nthem from each other. For all these reasons, and despite the unique,\ntragic, circumstances in which she lived and died, Rosa Luxemburg is a\ncontemporary rather than a martyr.\n",
