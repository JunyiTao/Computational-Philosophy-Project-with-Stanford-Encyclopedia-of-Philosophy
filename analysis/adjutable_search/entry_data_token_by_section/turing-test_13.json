    "main_text": "Some Minor Issues Arising || Turing\u2019s Predictions\n3.2 Turing\u2019s Predictions\n\nAs we noted earlier, Turing (1950) makes the claim that:\n\nI believe that in about fifty years\u2019 time it will be possible to\nprogramme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109,\nto make them play the imitation game so well that an average\ninterrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the\nright identification after five minutes of questioning. \u2026 I\nbelieve that at the end of the century the use of words and general\neducated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to\nspeak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.\n\n\nMost commentators contend that this claim has been shown to be\nmistaken: in the year 2000, no-one was able to program\ncomputers to make them play the imitation game so well that an average\ninterrogator had no more than a 70% chance of making the correct\nidentification after five minutes of questioning. Copeland (2000)\nargues that this contention is seriously mistaken: \u201cabout fifty\nyears\u201d is by no means \u201cexactly fifty years,\u201d and it\nremains open that we may soon be able to do the required programming.\nAgainst this, it should be noted that Turing (1950) goes on\nimmediately to refer to how things will be \u201cat the end of the\ncentury,\u201d which suggests that not too much can be read into the\nqualifying \u201cabout.\u201d However, as Copeland (2000) points\nout, there are other more cautious predictions that Turing makes\nelsewhere (e.g., that it would be \u201cat least 100 years\u201d\nbefore a machine was able to pass an unrestricted version of his\ntest); and there are other predictions that are made in Turing (1950)\nthat seem to have been vindicated. In particular, it is plausible to\nclaim that, in the year 2000, educated opinion had altered to the\nextent that, in many quarters, one could speak of the possibility of\nmachines\u2019 thinking\u2014and of machines\u2019\nlearning\u2014without expecting to be contradicted. As Moor (2001)\npoints out, \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d is not the oxymoron\nthat it might have been taken to be when Turing first started thinking\nabout these matters.\n",
