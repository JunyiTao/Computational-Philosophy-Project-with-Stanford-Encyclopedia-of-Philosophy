    "main_text": "\n\nIt might be expected that it would suffice for the entry for\n\u201cmoral anti-realism\u201d to contain only some links to other\nentries in this encyclopedia. It could contain a link to \u201cmoral\nrealism\u201d and stipulate the negation of the view described there.\nAlternatively, it could have links to the entries\n\u201canti-realism\u201d and \u201cmorality\u201d and could\nstipulate the conjunction of the materials contained therein. The fact\nthat neither of these approaches would be adequate\u2014and, more\nstrikingly, that following the two procedures would yield\nsubstantively non-equivalent results\u2014reveals the contentious and\nunsettled nature of the topic.\n\n\u201cAnti-realism,\u201d \u201cnon-realism,\u201d and\n\u201cirrealism\u201d may for most purposes be treated as\nsynonymous. Occasionally, distinctions have been suggested for local\npedagogic reasons (see, e.g., Wright 1988; Dreier 2004), but no such\ndistinction has generally taken hold. (\u201cQuasi-realism\u201d\ndenotes something very different, to be described below.) All three\nterms are to be defined in opposition to realism, but since there is\nno consensus on how \u201crealism\u201d is to be understood,\n\u201canti-realism\u201d fares no better. Crispin Wright (1992: 1)\ncomments that \u201cif there ever was a consensus of understanding\nabout \u2018realism\u2019, as a philosophical term of art, it has\nundoubtedly been fragmented by the pressures exerted by the various\ndebates\u2014so much so that a philosopher who asserts that she is a\nrealist about theoretical science, for example, or ethics, has\nprobably, for most philosophical audiences, accomplished little more\nthan to clear her throat.\u201d This entry doesn\u2019t purport to\ndo justice to the intricacy and subtlety of the topic of realism; it\nshould be acknowledged at the outset that the fragmentation of which\nWright speaks renders it unlikely that the label \u201cmoral\nanti-realism\u201d even succeeds in picking out a definite position.\nYet perhaps we can at least make an advance on clearing our\nthroats.\n",
