    "main_text": "Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition || Theory-ladenness\n2.1 Theory-ladenness\n\nObservations and definitions of terms can be theory-laden, in that\nthey depend on a set of theoretical assumptions for their\ninterpretation. Theory plays a role in background assumptions in\nanimal cognition about the continuity or discontinuity of the mental\nacross species, or regarding the relationship between certain\nbehaviors and certain capacities, or how best to get good results from\nresearch subjects.\n\nFor example, Darwin\u2019s perception of psychological continuity\nbetween species is an example of a theory-laden commitment that shapes\nhow the data is perceived. Among today\u2019s scientists, there is a\ndiversity of views about continuity and discontinuity. Some scientists\nmay be described as \u201cromantic\u201d because they take animals\nand humans to share many psychological properties the way Darwin\ndescribed it. Other scientists may be described as\n\u201ckilljoy\u201d because they deny many human capacities to\nanimals. This terminology, first used by Daniel Dennett (1983), and\ncriticized by Sara Shettleworth (2010b), highlights an example of a\ntheory-laden approach to science. Attempts to avoid working from one\nof these two perspectives are attempts to find objectivity, which as\nwe will see admits of its own challenges.\n\nAnimal cognition research can also be theory-laden within particular\nresearch paradigms. We can look at two current examples. The\ndecades-long use of the false belief task as a measure for theory of\nmind in children and animals can be traced back to three commentaries\non a scientific study of theory of mind (Premack & Woodruff 1978)\nby philosophers Dennett (1978), Jonathan Bennett (1978), and Gilbert\nHarman (1978), who first suggested this methodology. The suggestion\nreflected current philosophical theorizing associated with\nfunctionalism in the philosophy of mind, and a theory of action\naccording to which behaviors are caused by propositional\nattitudes\u2014beliefs and desires.\n\nAnother example is seen in research on social learning and imitation\nin nonhuman great apes that is grounded in the theory that the\nsignificant difference between humans and other animals rests on the\ncumulative nature of human culture (e.g., Dennett 2017; Henrich 2016;\nHeyes 2018; Sterelny 2012; Tomasello 2016). According to this theory,\nhumans learn cultural behavior by a process of high-fidelity imitation\nin which even causally irrelevant aspects of the behavior are\ncopied\u2014overimitation\u2014and subsequent generations innovate\nimprovements that lead to an ever-growing technological society.\nOverimitation is understood here to be a capacity towards which humans\nare strongly drawn and that is thought to be driven by social factors,\nsuch as a desire to \u201cfit in\u201d. Great apes have been tested\nfor overimitation several times and scientists have failed to find\nrobust evidence that they overimitate (though, complicating this\nstory, there is evidence that chimpanzees sometimes overimitate those\nwith whom they have a long-term relationship (Myowa-Yamakoshi &\nMatsuzawa 2000) and that domestic dogs sometimes overimitate their\nhuman companion (Huber et al. 2018; Huber et al. 2020)). In contrast,\nyoung children will readily overimitate the actions of selective\nexperimenters (Clay & Tennie 2018). Scientists have described this\npattern of results as a \u201cfailure\u201d on behalf of the apes\nand a \u201csuccess\u201d on behalf of the children, and are taken\nto bolster the claim that apes lack cumulative culture given theories\nof cultural learning.\n",
