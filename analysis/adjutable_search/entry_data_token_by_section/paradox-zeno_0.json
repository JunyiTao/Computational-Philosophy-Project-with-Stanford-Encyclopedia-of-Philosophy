    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nBefore we look at the paradoxes themselves it will be useful to sketch\nsome of their historical and logical significance. First, Zeno sought\nto defend Parmenides by attacking his critics. Parmenides rejected\npluralism and the reality of any kind of change: for him all was one\nindivisible, unchanging reality, and any appearances to the contrary\nwere illusions, to be dispelled by reason and revelation. Not\nsurprisingly, this philosophy found many critics, who ridiculed the\nsuggestion; after all it flies in the face of some of our most basic\nbeliefs about the world. (Interestingly, general\nrelativity\u2014particularly quantum general\nrelativity\u2014arguably provides a novel\u2014if novelty\nis possible\u2014argument for the Parmenidean denial of\nchange: Belot and Earman, 2001.) In response to this criticism Zeno\ndid something that may sound obvious, but which had a profound impact\non Greek philosophy that is felt to this day: he attempted to show\nthat equal absurdities followed logically from the denial of\nParmenides\u2019 views. You think that there are many things? Then\nyou must conclude that everything is both infinitely small and\ninfinitely big! You think that motion is infinitely divisible? Then it\nfollows that nothing moves! (This is what a \u2018paradox\u2019 is:\na demonstration that a contradiction or absurd consequence follows\nfrom apparently reasonable assumptions.) \n\nAs we read the arguments it is crucial to keep this method in mind.\nThey are always directed towards a more-or-less specific target: the\nviews of some person or school. We must bear in mind that the\narguments are \u2018ad hominem\u2019 in the literal Latin sense of\nbeing directed \u2018at (the views of) persons\u2019, but not\n\u2018ad hominem\u2019 in the traditional technical sense of\nattacking the (character of the) people who put forward the views\nrather than attacking the views themselves. They work by temporarily\nsupposing \u2018for argument\u2019s sake\u2019 that those\nassertions are true, and then arguing that if they are then absurd\nconsequences follow\u2014that nothing moves for example: they are\n\u2018reductio ad absurdum\u2019 arguments (or\n\u2018dialectic\u2019 in the sense of the period). Then, if the\nargument is logically valid, and the conclusion genuinely\nunacceptable, the assertions must be false after all. Thus when we\nlook at Zeno\u2019s arguments we must ask two related questions: whom\nor what position is Zeno attacking, and what exactly is assumed for\nargument\u2019s sake? If we find that Zeno makes hidden assumptions\nbeyond what the position under attack commits one to, then the absurd\nconclusion can be avoided by denying one of the hidden assumptions,\nwhile maintaining the position. Indeed commentators at least since\nAristotle have responded to Zeno in this way.\n\nSo whose views do Zeno\u2019s arguments attack? There is a huge\nliterature debating Zeno\u2019s exact historical target. As we shall\ndiscuss briefly below, some say that the target was a technical\ndoctrine of the Pythagoreans, but most today see Zeno as opposing\ncommon-sense notions of plurality and motion. We shall approach the\nparadoxes in this spirit, and refer the reader to the literature\nconcerning the interpretive debate.\n\nThat said, it is also the majority opinion that\u2014with certain\nqualifications\u2014Zeno\u2019s paradoxes reveal some problems that\ncannot be resolved without the full resources of mathematics as worked\nout in the Nineteenth century (and perhaps beyond). This is not\n(necessarily) to say that modern mathematics is required to answer any\nof the problems that Zeno explicitly wanted to raise; arguably\nAristotle and other ancients had replies that would\u2014or\nshould\u2014have satisfied Zeno. (Nor shall we make any particular\nclaims about Zeno\u2019s influence on the history of mathematics.)\nHowever, as mathematics developed, and more thought was given to the\nparadoxes, new difficulties arose from them; these difficulties\nrequire modern mathematics for their resolution. These new\ndifficulties arise partly in response to the evolution in our\nunderstanding of what mathematical rigor demands: solutions that would\nsatisfy Zeno\u2019s standards of rigor would not satisfy ours. Thus\nwe shall push several of the paradoxes from their common sense\nformulations to their resolution in modern mathematics. (Another\nqualification: we shall offer resolutions in terms of\n\u2018standard\u2019 mathematics, but other modern formulations are\nalso capable of dealing with Zeno, and arguably in ways that better\nrepresent his mathematical concepts.)\n",
