    "main_text": "Contemporary Compatibilism || Hierarchical Compatibilism\n4.2 Hierarchical Compatibilism\n\nOn the back of his rejection of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities, Harry Frankfurt (1971) developed a compatibilist theory\nthat does not appeal to regulative control in any way.\nFrankfurt\u2019s hierarchical mesh theory can instead be\nseen as a development of classical compatibilist attempts to\nunderstand freedom in terms of an agent\u2019s unencumbered ability\nto get what she wants (see Section 3.1.). More precisely, Frankfurt\nexplains freely willed action in terms of actions that issue from\ndesires that suitably mesh with hierarchically ordered elements of a\nperson\u2019s psychology. The key idea is that a person who acts of\nher own free will acts from desires that are nested within more\nencompassing elements of her self. On this view, when a freely willing\nagent acts, her actions emanate from her rather than from\nsomething foreign.\n4.2.1 Higher-Order Desires and Free Will\n\nFrankfurt distinguishes between first-order and second-order desires.\nThis serves as the basis for his hierarchical account of freedom. The\nformer desires have as their objects actions, such as eating a slice\nof cheesecake, taking in a movie, or gyrating one\u2019s hips to the\nsweet sounds of B. B. King. The latter are desires about desires. They\nhave as their objects, desires of the first-order, such as the desire\nto have the motivation to exercise daily (something that, regrettably,\ntoo many of us lack): \u201cIf only I wanted to go to the\ngym today, then it would be easy for me to get my tail off this\ncouch!\u201d\n\nAmongst the first-order desires that a person has, some are ones that\ndo not move her to action, such as one\u2019s (unsatisfied)\ndesire to say to her boss what she knows that she should not. Other\nfirst-order desires, however, do move a person to action,\nsuch as one\u2019s (satisfied) desire to follow through on her\nboss\u2019s request. Frankfurt identifies an agent\u2019s\nwill with her effective first-order desire, the one moving a\nperson, as Frankfurt puts it, \u201call the way to action\u201d\n(1971, p. 84).\n\nFrankfurt also distinguishes between different sorts of second-order\ndesires. Some are merely desires to have first-order desires, but\nnot that those first-order desires would comprise her will.\nFrankfurt uses the example of a psychotherapist who wishes to\nexperience a desire for narcotics so as to understand a patient\nbetter. The therapist has no wish that this desire be effective in\nleading her to action (1971, pp.84\u20135). She wants to know what it\nis like to feel the craving for the drug; she has no wish to take it.\nOn the other hand, other second-order desires that a person has are\ndesires for effective first-order desires, desires that would\ncomprise her will, and would thereby be effective in moving her all\nthe way to action. For instance, the dieter who is constantly\nfrustrated by her sugar cravings might desire a more effective desire\nfor health, one that would be more effective in guiding her eating\nhabits than it often is. These second-order desires Frankfurt calls\nsecond-order volitions. There is no theoretical limit to how\nhighly-ordered one\u2019s desires might be. The dieter in the above\nexample might develop a third-order desire for her second-order desire\n(regarding her desire for health) not to play such a dominant role in\nher daily deliberations. Other things, she might reason, are of more\nimportance in life than concerning herself with her dietary\nmotivations.\n\nOnce this conceptual apparatus is in place, Frankfurt contrasts\ndifferent sorts of addicts to illustrate his concept of free will.\nConsider first the unwilling addict, who is someone that has\nboth a first-order desire to take the drug, and a first-order desire\nnot to take the drug. Crucially, however, the unwilling addict also\nhas a second-order volition that her first-order desire to take the\ndrug not be her will. This is the basis for her\nunwillingness. Regrettably, her irresistible addictive desire to take\nthe drug constitutes her will. Next, consider the case of the\nwilling addict. The willing addict, like the unwilling\naddict, has conflicting first-order desires as regards taking the drug\nto which she is addicted. But the willing addict, by way of a\nsecond-order volition, embraces her addictive first-order desire to\ntake the drug. She wants to be as she is and act as she does.\n\nIt is now easy to illustrate Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical theory of\nfree will. The unwilling addict does not take the drug of her own free\nwill since her will conflicts at a higher level with what she wishes\nit to be. The willing addict, however, takes the drug of her own free\nwill since her will meshes with what she wishes it to be.\nFrankurt\u2019s theory can now be set out as follows:\n\nOne acts of her own free will if and only if her action issues from\nthe will she wants.\n\nIt might seem strange that Frankfurt\u2019s willing addict acts of\nher own free will since, due to her addiction, she could not do\notherwise. But recall that Frankfurt does not believe that freedom\ninvolving alternative possibilities is required for moral\nresponsibility. Frankfurt instead believes that the freedom pertinent\nto moral responsibility concerns what an agent does do and her actual\nbasis for doing it. That is, Frankfurt believes that it is, to again\nreturn to Fischer\u2019s helpful distinction, guidance control that\nis necessary for moral responsibility, not regulative control. The\nwilling addict possesses the sort of freedom required for moral\nresponsibility because the will leading to her action is the one that\nshe wishes it to be; she acts with guidance control.\n4.2.2 Two Problems for a Hierarchical Theory\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s hierarchical theory has faced intense scrutiny. Here\nwe consider two objections that emerge from structural aspects of it.\nOne has to do with its hierarchical nature. The other has to do with\nits relying exclusively upon a mesh between different features of an\nagent\u2019s psychology. (For a discussion of Frankfurt\u2019s\nattempts to respond to these problems, see section A of the\nsupplement,\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.)\n\nConsider the hierarchical problem. According to Frankfurt, a\nperson facing a problem with regard to her will\u2019s freedom faces\na situation in which she is conflicted about one (or more) of her\nfirst-order desires. Which desire \u201cspeaks for\u201d the agent?\nWith which desire can she be identified? To resolve conflicts between\nfirst-order desires (or between an agent\u2019s attitudes about a\nspecific first-order desire), Frankfurt tells us that a person forms a\nsecond-order desire that has as its object the first-order desire(s)\nshe wants to move her to action. By this means, an agent endorses or\nidentifies with one of the first-order desires and, if all goes\nsmoothly, that one becomes her will. Through this process, she draws\nwithin the sphere of her self one sort of desire and alienates\nanother. But here, a problem arises. A person cannot be identified\nwith her first-order desires because she can be alienated from them.\nYet she can also be alienated from second, or even at higher-orders\n(Watson 1975). After all, she might find herself both wanting that\nsome specific first-order desire be her will and horrified at the\nthought (i.e., not want it to be the case that that particular\nfirst-order desire be her will). Hence, the problem of an\nagent\u2019s free will can reappear at these ever ascending stages.\nIf this is correct, Frankfurt\u2019s view is incomplete. Maybe his\naccount of free will does articulate a necessary condition for acting\nof one\u2019s own free will, but it appears not to be sufficient. It\nneeds supplementing so as to avoid the problem of a spiraling\nreoccurrence of challenges to an agent\u2019s freedom.\n\nNext consider the mesh problem. According to Frankfurt, if\nfreely willed action for which an agent is morally responsible wholly\ndepends on the relation between an agent\u2019s will and her\nsecond-order volitions, then it does not matter in any way how an\nagent came to have that particular mesh. But cases can be constructed\nthat seem to suggest that it does matter how an agent came to\nhave a particular mesh between her first-order and her second-order\ndesires. (For example, see Slote 1980; and Fischer & Ravizza 1998,\npp. 194\u2013206.) Using Frankfurt\u2019s own example of the willing\naddict, suppose that the addict\u2019s second-order willingness is\nitself caused by the effects of the drug use. Suppose that the drug\nuse has impaired her evaluations or preferences arising at a\nsecond-order of reflection on her own mental states. Or, setting this\nsort of case aside, imagine that an agent is brainwashed or\nmanipulated through some means or another, say by hypnosis, or by\naliens zapping a person into having a different set of psychological\npreferences than those that she would otherwise have. In all of these\ncases\u2014just call them manipulation cases\u2014Frankfurt\nseems committed to the view that such agents act of their own free\nwill and are morally responsible so long as the appropriate\npsychological mesh is in place, no matter what sort of (merely\napparent) freedom and responsibility-undermining history gave way to\nan agent\u2019s having that particular mesh.\n\nThis highlights the real difficulty Frankfurt\u2019s view faces in\nlight of the Source Incompatibilist Argument. Since Frankfurt holds\nthat what matters for moral responsibility is the relationship between\nan agent\u2019s effective first-order desire and her second-order\nvolition, and not the source of those respective desires, he is\ncommitted to thinking that even if the desires are implanted by some\nalien force, the agent can still be responsible for acting on them.\nBut many have found it dubious that an agent could be responsible for\nan action that flows from motives that can be traced back to forces\noutside of the agent. In response, Frankfurt must show that being the\nsource of one\u2019s motives is not needed for moral responsibility.\nIf he cannot, then it seems that the source incompatibilist has the\nupper hand. She can straightforwardly argue that, if one sort alien\ncausal history that gives rise to the Frankfurtian mesh undermines\nagents\u2019 freedom and responsibility, then why wouldn\u2019t a\ndeterministic history do the same?\n",
