    "main_text": "\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) semantics is a formal framework that is used to\ncharacterize the meaning of certain linguistic expressions and the\nentailment relations among sentences containing them. Two-dimensional\nsemantics has also been applied to thought contents. In contrast with\nstandard possible worlds semantics, 2D semantics assigns extensions\nand truth-values to expressions relative to two possible world\nparameters, rather than just one. So a 2D semantic framework provides\nfiner-grained semantic values than those available within standard\npossible world semantics, while using the same basic model-theoretic\nresources. The 2D framework itself is just a formal tool. To develop a\nsemantic theory for someone\u2019s language, a proponent of 2D\nsemantics must do three things: (i) explain what exactly the two\npossible world parameters represent, (ii) explain the rules for\nassigning 2D semantic values to a person\u2019s words and sentences,\nand (iii) explain how 2D semantic values help in understanding the\nmeanings of the person\u2019s words and sentences.\n\nThe two-dimensional framework has been interpreted in different ways\nfor different explanatory purposes. The two most widely accepted\napplications of two-dimensional semantics target restricted classes of\nexpressions. David Kaplan\u2019s 2D semantic framework for indexicals\nis widely used to explain conventional semantic rules governing\ncontext-dependent expressions like \u2018I\u2019,\n\u2018that\u2019, or \u2018here\u2019, which pick out different\nthings depending on the context in which the expression is used. And\nlogicians working on tense and modal logic use 2D semantics to\ncharacterize the logical implications of operators like\n\u2018now\u2019, \u2018actually\u2019, and\n\u2018necessarily\u2019. Such restricted applications of 2D\nsemantics are intended to systematize and explain uncontroversial\naspects of linguistic understanding.\n\nTwo-dimensional semantics has also been used for more ambitious\nphilosophical purposes. Influential theorists like David Lewis, Frank\nJackson and David Chalmers argue that a generalized 2D semantic\nframework can be used to isolate an apriori aspect of meaning.\nRoughly, the idea is that speakers always have apriori access to the\ntruth-conditions associated with their own sentences. On the face of\nit, this apriority claim seems to conflict with the observation that\ncertain necessary truths, such as \u2018water =\nH2O\u2019, can be known only on the basis of empirical\ninquiry. But proponents of generalized 2D semantics argue that the 2D\nframework undercuts this objection, by showing how such aposteriori\nnecessities are consistent with apriori access to truth-conditions.\nThe positive reasons to accept generalized 2D semantics, however, are\nbound up with larger (and partly disjoint) explanatory projects. As a\nconsequence, debates over the merits of generalized 2D semantics touch\non broader controversies about apriority, modality, semantic theory\nand philosophical methodology.\n\nThe two-dimensional framework can also figure in a theory of ad\nhoc language use, instead of a theory of literal meanings. Robert\nStalnaker\u2019s influential 2D account of assertion falls in this\ncategory. His \u201cmetasemantic\u201d interpretation of the 2D\nframework is intended to characterize what is communicated when\nconversational partners are partially ignorant or mistaken about the\nliteral meaning of their own words. Although it is formally similar to\ngeneralized 2D semantics, Stalnaker\u2019s use of the 2D framework\navoids apriori accessible truth-conditions of the sort posited by\ngeneralized 2D semantics.\n",
