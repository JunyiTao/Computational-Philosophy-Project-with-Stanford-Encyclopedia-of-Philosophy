    "main_text": "\n1. Motivations for hybrid logic\n\nIn the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic, truth is relative to\npoints in a set. Thus, a propositional symbol might have different\ntruth-values relative to different points. Usually, these points are\ntaken to represent possible worlds, times, epistemic states, states in\na computer, or something else. This allows us to formalize natural\nlanguage statements whose truth-values are relative to for example\ntimes, like the statement\n\nIt is raining.\n\n\nwhich clearly has different truth-values at different times. Now,\ncertain natural language statements are true at exactly one time,\npossible world, or something else. An example is the statement\n\nIt is five o\u2019clock 15 November 2021.\n\n\nwhich is true at the time five o\u2019clock 15 November 2021, but\nfalse at all other times. The first kind of natural language\nstatements can be formalized in ordinary modal logic, but the second\nkind cannot.\n\nA major motivation for hybrid logic is to add further expressive power\nto ordinary modal logic with the aim of being able to formalize the\nsecond kind of statements. This is obtained by adding to ordinary\nmodal logic a second sort of propositional symbols called\nnominals such that in the Kripke semantics each nominal is\ntrue relative to exactly one point. A natural language statement of\nthe second kind (like the example statement with the time five\no\u2019clock 15 November 2021) is then formalized using a nominal,\nnot an ordinary propositional symbol (which would be used to formalize\nthe example statement with rainy weather). The fact that a nominal is\ntrue relative to exactly one point implies that a nominal can be\nconsidered a term referring to a point, for example, if \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)\nis a nominal that stands for \u201cit is five o\u2019clock 15\nNovember 2021\u201d, then this nominal can be considered a term\nreferring to the time five o\u2019clock 15 November 2021. Thus, in\nhybrid logic a term is a specific sort of propositional symbol whereas\nin first-order logic it is an argument to a predicate.\n\nMost hybrid logics involve further additional machinery than nominals.\nThere is a number of options for such additions; here we shall\nconsider what are called satisfaction operators. The\nmotivation for adding satisfaction operators is to be able to\nformalize a statement being true at a particular time, possible world,\nor something else. For example, we want to be able to formalize that\nthe statement \u201cit is raining\u201d is true at the time five\no\u2019clock 15 November 2021, that is, that\n\nAt five o\u2019clock 15 November 2021, it is raining.\n\n\nThis is formalized by the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a p}\\) where the nominal\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) stands for \u201cit is five o\u2019clock 15 November\n2021\u201d as above and where \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) is an ordinary\npropositional symbol that stands for \u201cit is raining\u201d. It\nis the part \\(\\mathtt{@_a}\\) of the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a p}\\) that is\ncalled a satisfaction operator. In general, if \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) is a\nnominal and \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is an arbitrary formula, then a new\nformula \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) called a satisfaction statement\ncan be built. The satisfaction statement \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\)\nexpresses that the formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to one\nparticular point, namely the point to which the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)\nrefers.\n\nTo sum up, we have now added further expressive power to ordinary\nmodal logic in the form of nominals and satisfaction operators.\nInformally, the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) has the truth-condition\n\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) is true relative to a point \\(w\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\nthe reference of \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) is identical to \\(w\\).\n\n\nand the satisfaction statement \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) has the\ntruth-condition\n\n\\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) is true relative to a point \\(w\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to the reference of \\(\\mathtt{a}\\).\n\n\nNote that actually the point \\(w\\) does not matter in the\ntruth-condition for \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) since the satisfaction\noperator \\(\\mathtt{@_a}\\) moves the point of evaluation to the\nreference of \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) whatever \\(w\\) is.\n\nIt is remarkable that nominals together with satisfaction operators\nallow us to express that two points are identical: If the nominals\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\) refer to the points \\(w\\) and \\(v\\),\nthen the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a b}\\) expresses that \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) are\nidentical. The following line of reasoning shows why.\n\n\\(\\mathtt{@_a b}\\) is true relative to a point \\(w\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\n\\(\\mathtt{b}\\) is true relative to the reference of \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\n\\(\\mathtt{b}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\nthe reference of \\(\\mathtt{b}\\) is identical to \\(w\\)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if and only if\n\n\\(v\\) is identical to \\(w\\).\n\n\nThe identity relation on a set has the well-known properties\nreflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which is reflected in the\nfact that the formulas \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\mathtt{@_a a} \\\\\n& \\mathtt{@_a b \\rightarrow @_b a} \\\\\n&(\\mathtt{@_a b \\amp @_b c) \\rightarrow @_a c}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nare valid formulas of hybrid logic. Also the formula \n\n\\[\n(\\mathtt{@_ab \\amp @_a\\phi) \\rightarrow @_b\\phi}\n\\]\n\n\nis valid. This is the rule of replacement. Note the similarity to the\nformula \\(\\mathtt{(a=b \\amp \\phi(a)) \\rightarrow \\phi(b)}\\) in\nfirst-order logic with equality (commonly called Leibniz\u2019\nLaw).\n\nBeside nominals and satisfaction operators, in what follows we shall\nconsider the so-called binders \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) allowing us to build formulas\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall a \\phi}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a \\phi}\\). The\nbinders bind nominals to points in two different ways: The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder quantifies over points analogous to the\nstandard first-order universal quantifier, that is, \\(\\mathtt{\\forall\na \\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\) if and only if whatever point the\nnominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) refers to, it is the case that\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\). The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder binds a nominal to the point of\nevaluation, that is, \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a \\phi}\\) is true relative\nto \\(w\\) if and only if \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\)\nwhen \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) refers to \\(w\\). It turns out that the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder is definable in terms of\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) (as shown below).\n2. Formal semantics\n\nThe language we consider is the language of ordinary modal logic built\nover ordinary propositional symbols \\(\\mathtt{p}, \\mathtt{q},\n\\mathtt{r}, \u2026\\) as well as nominals \\(\\mathtt{a}, \\mathtt{b},\n\\mathtt{c}, \u2026\\) and extended with satisfaction operators and\nbinders. We take the propositional connectives \\(\\mathtt{\\wedge}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{\\neg}\\) to be primitive; other propositional connectives are\ndefined as usual. Similarly, we take the modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\) to be primitive and define the modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Diamond}\\) as \\(\\mathtt{\\neg \\Box \\neg}\\). As the name\nsuggests, binders bind nominals and the notions of free and bound\noccurrences of nominals are defined analogously to first-order logic.\nSatisfaction operators do not bind nominals, that is, the free nominal\noccurrences in a formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) are the free nominal\noccurrences in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) together with the occurrence of\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\). We let \\(\\mathtt{\\phi[c/a]}\\) be the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) where the nominal \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) has been\nsubstituted for all free occurrences of the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\). If\nthe nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) occurs free in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) within the\nscope of \\(\\mathtt{\\forall c}\\) or \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c}\\), then\nthe bound nominal \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is renamed as\nappropriate.\n\nWe now define models and frames. A model for hybrid logic is\na triple \\((W, R, V)\\) where \\(W\\) is a non-empty set, \\(R\\) is a\nbinary relation on \\(W\\), and \\(V\\) is a function that assigns an\nelement of the set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) to each pair consisting of an element\nof \\(W\\) and an ordinary propositional symbol. The pair \\((W, R)\\) is\ncalled a frame. Thus, models and frames are the same as in\nordinary modal logic. The elements of \\(W\\) are called worlds\nand the relation \\(R\\) is called the accessibility relation.\nThe model \\((W, R, V)\\) is said to be based on the frame\n\\((W, R)\\).\n\nAn assignment for a model \\(M = (W, R, V)\\) is a function\n\\(g\\) that assigns an element of \\(W\\) to each nominal. An assignment\n\\(g'\\) is an \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)-variant of \\(g\\) if \\(g'\\) agrees\nwith \\(g\\) on all nominals save possibly \\(\\mathtt{a}\\). The relation\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\phi\\) is defined by induction, where \\(g\\) is an\nassignment, \\(w\\) is an element of \\(W\\), and \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is a\nformula.\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{p}\\) iff \\(V(w, \\mathtt{p})=1\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{a}\\) iff \\(w = g(\\mathtt{a})\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi \\wedge \\psi}\\) iff \\(M, g, w \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) and \\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\psi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\neg \\phi}\\) iff not \\(M, g, w \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\Box} \\phi\\) iff for any element \\(v\\) of\n\\(W\\) such that \\(wRv\\), it is the case that \\(M, g, v \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) iff \\(M, g, g(\\mathtt{a}) \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\forall a\\phi}\\) iff for any\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\)-variant \\(g'\\) of \\(g\\), it is the case that \\(M, g', w\n\\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a\\phi}\\) iff \\(M, g', w \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) where \\(g'\\) is the \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)-variant of \\(g\\)\nsuch that \\(g'(\\mathtt{a}) = w\\).\n\n\nA formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is said to be true at \\(w\\) if\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\); otherwise it is said to be\nfalse at \\(w\\). By convention \\(M, g \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\nmeans \\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for every element \\(w\\) of\n\\(W\\) and \\(M \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) means \\(M, g \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for every assignment \\(g\\). A formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in a frame if and only if \\(M\n\\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for any model \\(M\\) that is based on the frame\nin question. A formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in a class\nof frames \\(F\\) if and only if \\( \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in any\nframe in \\(F\\). A formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid if and\nonly if \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in the class of all frames. The\ndefinition of satisfiability is left to the reader.\n\nNote that the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) is definable in terms of\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) as the formula \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a\\phi\n\\leftrightarrow \\forall a(a \\rightarrow \\phi)}\\) is valid in any\nframe.\n\nThe fact that hybridizing ordinary modal logic actually does give more\nexpressive power can, for example, be seen by considering the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\). It is straightforward to check\nthat this formula is valid in a frame if and only if the frame is\nirreflexive. Thus, irreflexivity can be expressed by a hybrid-logical\nformula, but it is well known that it cannot be expressed by any\nformula of ordinary modal logic. Irreflexivity can actually be\nexpressed just by adding nominals to ordinary modal logic, namely by\nthe formula \\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow \\Box \\neg c}\\). Other examples of\nproperties expressible in hybrid logic, but not in ordinary modal\nlogic, are asymmetry (expressed by \\(\\mathtt{c \\rightarrow \\Box \\neg\n\\Diamond c }\\)), antisymmetry (expressed by \\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow\n\\Box(\\Diamond c \\rightarrow c)}\\)), and universality (expressed by\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Diamond c}\\)).\n\nSee the handbook chapter Areces and ten Cate (2006) for a detailed\naccount of the syntax and semantics of hybrid logic, as well as many\nother basic definitions. The syntax and semantics above can be\nextended in a number of ways, in particular, first-order\nquantification can be added (of course, an equivalent way to obtain\nfirst-order hybrid logic is by adding hybrid-logical machinery to\nfirst-order modal logic). See Bra\u00fcner (2014) for an overview of\nfirst-order hybrid logic, see Chapter 6 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a) for a\nmore detailed account, and see Chapter 7 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a) for\nan account of intensional first-order hybrid logic.\n3. Translations\n\nHybrid logic can be translated into first-order logic with equality,\nand (a fragment of) first-order logic with equality can be translated\nback into (a fragment of) hybrid logic. The first-order language under\nconsideration has a 1-place predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{p^*}\\)\ncorresponding to each ordinary propositional symbol \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) of\nmodal logic, a 2-place predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{R}\\), and a 2-place\npredicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{=}\\). Of course, the predicate symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{p^*}\\) will be interpreted such that it relativises the\ninterpretation of the corresponding modal propositional symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{p}\\) to worlds, the predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{R}\\) will be\ninterpreted using the accessibility relation, and the predicate symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{=}\\) will be interpreted using the identity relation on\nworlds. We let \\(\\mathtt{a}, \\mathtt{b}, \\mathtt{c},\\ldots\\) range\nover first-order variables. The language does not have constant or\nfunction symbols. We shall identify first-order variables with\nnominals of hybrid logic.\n\nWe first translate hybrid logic into first-order logic with equality.\nGiven two new first-order variables \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\),\nthe translations \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\) and\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b}\\) are defined by mutual recursion. We just\ngive the translation \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\). \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{p}) &= \\mathtt{p^*(a)} \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{c}) &= \\mathtt{a=c} \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi \\wedge \\psi}) &= \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi}) \\mathtt{\\wedge} \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\psi}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\neg \\phi}) &= \\mathtt{\\neg} \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}(\\phi) \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\Box \\phi}) &= \\mathtt{\\forall b(R(a, b) \\rightarrow} \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b} (\\mathtt{\\phi})\\mathtt{)} \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{@_c \\phi}) &= \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi})[\\mathtt{c}/\\mathtt{a}]  \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\phi}) &= \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi})[\\mathtt{a}/\\mathtt{c}] \\\\\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\forall c\\phi}) &= \\mathtt{\\forall c }\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi})\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe definition of \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b}\\) is obtained by exchanging\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\). The translation is an extension of\nthe well-known standard translation from modal logic into\nfirst-order logic. As an example, we demonstrate step by step how the\nhybrid-logical formula \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\) is\ntranslated into a first-order formula: \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}) \n  &= \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\Box \\neg c})[\\mathtt{a}/\\mathtt{c}] \\\\\n  &= \\mathtt{\\forall b(R(a, b) \\rightarrow } \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b} (\\mathtt{\\neg c})\\mathtt{)}[\\mathtt{a}/\\mathtt{c}] \\\\\n  &= \\mathtt{\\forall b(R(a, b) \\rightarrow \\neg } \\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b} (\\mathtt{c})\\mathtt{)}[\\mathtt{a}/\\mathtt{c}] \\\\\n  &= \\mathtt{\\forall b(R(a, b) \\rightarrow \\neg b=c)}[\\mathtt{a}/\\mathtt{c}] \\\\\n  &= \\mathtt{\\forall b(R(a, b) \\rightarrow \\neg b=a)}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe resulting first-order formula is equivalent to \\(\\mathtt{\\neg R(a,\na)}\\) which shows that \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\) indeed\ndoes correspond to the accessibility relation being irreflexive, cf.\nabove.\n\nFirst-order logic with equality can be translated back into hybrid\nlogic by the translation HT given below. \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{p^*(a)}) &= \\mathtt{@_a p} \\\\\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{R(a, c)}) &= \\mathtt{@_a \\Diamond c} \\\\\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{a=c}) &= \\mathtt{@_a c} \\\\\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\phi \\wedge \\psi}) &= \\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\phi}) \\mathtt{\\wedge} \\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\psi}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\neg \\phi}) &= \\mathtt{\\neg} \\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\phi}) \\\\\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\forall a\\phi}) &= \\mathtt{\\forall a} \\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\phi})\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nNote that the hybrid-logical binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) is needed.\nThe history of the above mentioned observations goes back to the work\nof Arthur N. Prior, we shall return to that later.\n\nSimilarly, what is called the bounded fragment of first-order\nlogic can be translated into the hybrid logic but here only the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) is needed, as pointed out in the paper Areces,\nBlackburn, and Marx (2001). The bounded fragment is the fragment of\nfirst-order logic with the property that quantifiers only occur as in\nthe formula \\(\\mathtt{\\forall c(R(a, c) \\rightarrow \\phi)}\\), where it\nis required that the variables \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) are\ndifferent. A translation from the bounded fragment to the hybrid logic\nwithout the \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder can be obtained by replacing\nthe last clause in the translation HT above by \n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\forall c(R(a, c) \\rightarrow \\phi)}) = \\mathtt{@_a \\Box {\\downarrow} c}\\mathrm{HT}(\\mathtt{\\phi}).\n\\]\n\n\nIn Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) a number of independent semantic\ncharacterisations of the bounded fragment are given.\n\nThe translations given above are truth-preserving. To state this\nformally, one makes use of the well-known observation that models and\nassignments for hybrid logic can be considered as models and\nassignments for first-order logic and vice versa. These\ntruth-preservation results are straightforward to formulate and we\nleave the details to the reader. Thus, the hybrid logic with the\nbinder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) has the same expressive power as\nfirst-order logic with equality and the hybrid logic without the\nbinder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) (but with the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\)) has the same expressive power as the bounded\nfragment of first-order logic (note that the translation\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi})\\) of any formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) without the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) is in the\nbounded fragment).\n\nThe translations above can be extended to first-order hybrid logic, in\nwhich case the relevant target logic is two-sorted first-order logic\nwith equality, one sort for worlds and one sort for individuals, see\nChapter 6 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a). In the case of intensional\nfirst-order hybrid logic, three sorts are employed, the third sort\nbeing for intensions, see Chapter 7 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a).\n4. Arthur N. Prior and hybrid logic\n\nThe history of hybrid logic goes back to Arthur N. Prior\u2019s\nhybrid tense logic, which is a hybridized version of ordinary tense\nlogic. With the aim of investigating this further, we shall give a\nformal definition of hybrid tense logic. The language of hybrid tense\nlogic is simply the language of hybrid logic defined above except that\nthere are two modal operators, namely \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\), instead of the single modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\). The two new modal operators are called tense\noperators. The semantics of hybrid tense logic is the semantics\nof hybrid logic, cf. earlier, with the clause for \\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\)\nreplaced by clauses for the tense operators \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\).\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{G \\phi}\\) iff for any element \\(v\\) of \\(W\\)\nsuch that \\(wRv\\), it is the case that \\(M, g, v \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{H \\phi}\\) iff for any element \\(v\\) of \\(W\\)\nsuch that \\(vRw\\), it is the case that \\(M, g, v \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\nThus, there are now two modal operators, namely one that \u201clooks\nforwards\u201d along the accessibility relation and one that\n\u201clooks backwards\u201d. In tense logic the elements of the set\n\\(W\\) are called moments or instants and the\nrelation \\(R\\) is called the earlier-later relation.\n\nOf course, it is straightforward to modify the translations\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_a\\) and \\(\\mathrm{HT}\\) above such that translations are\nobtained between hybrid tense logic (including the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder) and first-order logic with equality. The\nfirst-order logic under consideration is what Prior called\nfirst-order earlier-later logic. Given the translations, it\nfollows that Prior\u2019s first-order earlier-later logic has the\nsame expressive power as hybrid tense logic.\n\nNow, Prior introduced hybrid tense logic in connection with what he\ncalled four grades of tense-logical involvement. The motivation for\nhis four grades of tense-logical involvement was philosophical. The\nfour grades were presented in the book Prior (1968), Chapter XI (also\nChapter XI in the new edition Prior (2003)). Moreover, see Prior\n(1967), Chapter V.6 and Appendix B.3-4. For a more general discussion,\nsee the posthumously published book Prior and Fine (1977). The stages\nprogress from what can be regarded as pure first-order earlier-later\nlogic to what can be regarded as pure tense logic; the goal being to\nbe able to consider the tense logic of the fourth stage as\nencompassing the earlier-later logic of the first stage. In other\nwords, the goal was to be able to translate the first-order logic of\nthe earlier-later relation into tense logic. It was with this goal in\nmind Prior introduced so-called instant-propositions:\n\nWhat I shall call the third grade of tense-logical involvement\nconsists in treating the instant-variables \\(a, b, c\\), etc. as also\nrepresenting propositions. (Prior 2003, p. 124)\n\n\nIn the context of modal logic, Prior called such propositions\npossible-world-propositions. Of course, this is what we here call\nnominals. Prior also introduced the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) and\nwhat we here call satisfaction operators (he used the notation\n\\(\\mathtt{T(a, \\phi)}\\) instead of \\(\\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) for\nsatisfaction operators). In fact, Prior\u2019s third grade tense\nlogic is identical to the hybrid tense logic as defined above. The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder was introduced much later. Thus, Prior\nobtained the expressive power of his first-order earlier-later logic\nby adding to ordinary tense logic further expressive power in the form\nof nominals, satisfaction operators, and the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\). So from a technical point of view he clearly\nreached his goal.\n\nHowever, from a philosophical point of view it has been debated\nwhether or not the ontological import of his third grade tense logic\nis the same as the ontological import of the first-order earlier-later\nlogic. For example, the \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder is by some authors\nconsidered a direct analogy to the first-order \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\)\nquantifier, and therefore suspect; see for example the paper Sylvan\n(1996) in the collection Copeland (1996). See Bra\u00fcner (2002) for\na discussion of Prior\u2019s fourth grade tense logic. See also\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1993), \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nHasle (2006), M\u00fcller (2007), and Blackburn (2006). Finally, see\nthe discussion of Prior\u2019s four grades in Chapter 1 of\nBra\u00fcner (2011a).\n\nThe paper Hasle (2020) points out traces of hybrid-logical ideas in\nPrior\u2019s works before the publication of Prior (1967) and Prior\n(1968) (new edition Prior (2003)). The above mentioned paper\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (2006) gives a detailed account of\nPrior\u2019s logical work. For a comprehensive account of\nPrior\u2019s life and work, see the book \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nHasle (1995). The paper Hasle and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2016)\ndescribes Prior\u2019s methodological approach, in particular, his\nview on formalisation and the role of symbolic logic in conceptual\nstudies.\n5. The development of hybrid logic since Prior\n\nThe first completely rigorous definition of hybrid logic was given in\nBull (1970), which appeared in a special issue of the journal\nTheoria in memory of Prior. Bull introduces a third sort of\npropositional symbols where a propositional symbol is assumed to be\ntrue exactly at one branch (\u201ccourse of events\u201d) in a\nbranching time model. This idea of sorting propositional symbols\naccording to restrictions on their interpretations has been developed\nfurther by a number of authors, see Section 5 of the paper Blackburn\nand Tzakova (1999) and also Blackburn and Goranko (2001).\n\nThe hybrid logical approach originally invented by Prior in the late\n1960s was reinvented in the 1980s by Solomon Passy and Tinko Tinchev\nfrom Bulgaria, see Passy and Tinchev (1985) as well as Passy and\nTinchev (1991). Rather than ordinary modal logic, this work took place\nin connection with the much more expressive Propositional Dynamic\nLogic.\n\nA major contribution in the 1990s was the introduction of the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder. An early version of the downarrow\nbinder was introduced by Valentin Goranko in the papers Goranko (1994)\nand Goranko (1996). The version of the present paper was introduced in\nBlackburn and Seligman (1995). Since then, hybrid logic with the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder has been extensively studied, see for\nexample the paper Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) on\nmodel-theoretic aspects of this logic. A comprehensive study of the\nmodel-theory of hybrid logic is the PhD thesis of ten Cate (2004). The\npaper Areces, Fervari, Hoffmann, and Martel (2018) considers the\nrelationship between strong hybrid logics with the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder and what are called relation-changing\nmodal logics.\n\nAlso the weaker hybrid logic obtained by omitting both of the binders\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) has been the subject\nof extensive exploration. It turns out that this binder-free logic and\na number of variants of it are decidable. In the paper Areces,\nBlackburn, and Marx (1999), a number of complexity results are given\nfor hybrid modal and tense logics over various classes of frames, for\nexample arbitrary, transitive, linear, and branching. It is remarkable\nthat the satisfiability problem of the binder-free hybrid logic over\narbitrary frames is decidable in PSPACE, which is the same as the\ncomplexity of deciding satisfiability in ordinary modal logic. Thus,\nhybridizing ordinary modal logic gives more expressive power, but the\ncomplexity stays the same. Some work has been carried out on\nsimulating nominals inside modal logic, see Kracht and Wolter\n(1997).\n\nAny ordinary modal formula expresses a monadic second-order property\non frames, and it is well-known that for some modal formulas,\nincluding what are called Sahlqvist formulas, the second-order\nproperty is equivalent to a first-order property. In the paper Goranko\nand Vakarelov (2006) this is shown to hold also for a class of\nhybrid-logical formulas, including nominals. Several algorithms exists\nfor calculating first-order equivalents of ordinary modal formulas.\nOne such algorithm, SQEMA, is in the paper Conradie, Goranko, and\nVakarelov (2006) extended to encompass the hybrid-logical formulas\nconsidered in Goranko and Vakarelov (2006).\n\nAs described in the previous section, Prior introduced hybrid tense\nlogic to deal with a particular issue in the philosophy of time, but\nin Prior (1968), Chapter XIV (also Chapter XIV in the new edition\nPrior (2003)), he also showed that hybrid tense logic can replace a\ntwo-dimensional temporal logic introduced by Hans Kamp in unpublished\nmaterial circulated in 1967, and later included in Kamp (1971). The\ndimension is simply the number of instants a formula is evaluated\nrelative to, so adding hybrid-logical machinery enables two dimensions\nto be replaced by one. This work has recently been followed up in a\nnumber of papers by Blackburn and J\u00f8rgensen, see Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2016a) for an overview. We now give a brief sketch\nof this line of work, adapted to the terminology of the present entry.\nThe version of hybrid logic in question has a designated nominal\n\\(\\mathtt{now}\\) and each model comes with a designated time \\( t_0 \\)\nsuch that i) any stand-alone formula is evaluated relative to \\( t_0\n\\) and ii) the nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\) refers to \\( t_0 \\). More\nformally, we adopt the convention that \\((M,t_0), g \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) means \\(M, g, t_0 \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) and we only\nconsider assignments \\(g\\) where \\(g(\\mathtt{now})=t_0\\). Note that\nthe nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\), considered as a stand-alone formula, is\nvalid in this semantics, but this is not the case for any other\nnominal. This new notion of validity is by Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen called contextual validity. The paper\nBlackburn and J\u00f8rgensen (2013) gives an axiom system which is\ncomplete wrt. this notion of contextual validity. The paper Blackburn\nand J\u00f8rgensen (2012) gives a complete tableau system, but the\nsemantics of this paper is in line with Kamp\u2019s original\ntwo-dimensional semantics. Both papers also consider further\nindexicals like \\(\\mathtt{yesterday}\\), \\(\\mathtt{today}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{tomorrow}\\). \n\nThe paper Blackburn and J\u00f8rgensen (2016b) uses hybrid tense\nlogic to combine ideas of Prior with those of Hans Reichenbach on how\nto represent natural language tenses. Prior preferred the well-known\ntense operators described above, whereas Reichenbach preferred\ntemporal references, that is, references to specific times,\nReichenbach (1947). It turns out that the two approaches can be\ncombined, which was not the route taken by Prior\nhimself\u2013\u2013see the account given in Blackburn and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2016b), \n\nHybrid-logical notions have been applied in many different places, for\nexample, the paper Areces and Fervari (2021) adds hybrid operators to\nXPath, which is a widely used query language for XML, a markup\nlanguage for describing digital text. Hybrid-logical has also been\nused to add expressive power to specification logics to capture\ncertain properties of computational systems, see Neves, Madeira,\nMartins, Barbosa (2016). It should, moreover, be mentioned that logics\nsimilar to hybrid logics play a central role within the area of\ndescription logic, which is a family of logics used for knowledge\nrepresentation in Artificial Intelligence, see the paper Blackburn and\nTzakova (1998) and Carlos Areces\u2019 PhD thesis (2000).\n6. Axioms for hybrid logic\n\nA number of papers have dealt with axioms for hybrid logic, for\nexample Gargov and Goranko (1993), Blackburn (1993), and Blackburn and\nTzakova (1999). In the paper Gargov and Goranko (1993) an axiom system\nfor hybrid logic is given, and it is shown that if the system is\nextended with a set of additional axioms which are pure\nformulas (that is, formulas where all propositional symbols are\nnominals), then the extended axiom system is complete with respect to\nthe class of frames validating the axioms in question. Pure formulas\ncorrespond to first-order conditions on the accessibility relation\n(cf. the translation \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\) above), so axiom\nsystems for new hybrid logics with first-order conditions on the\naccessibility relation can be obtained in a uniform way simply by\nadding axioms as appropriate. So, if, for example, the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow \\Box \\neg c}\\) is added as an axiom, then the\nresulting system is complete with respect to irreflexive frames, as we\nmentioned earlier. See the discussion of such rules in Section 4 of\nthe paper Blackburn (2000).\n\nThe proof\u00ad system in Gargov and Goranko (1993) makes use of a\ncomplex rule (called COV) where the formula schema containing the\nactive part of the rule can be arbitrarily large; in fact, the active\npart is embedded under arbitrarily deep nestings of modal operators.\nBlackburn and Tzakova (1999) shows that satisfaction operators can be\nused to formulate an axiom system in a more standard format, using a\nsimpler rule called PASTE, such that the system is still complete when\nextended with pure axions. \n\nThe paper Blackburn and ten Cate (2006) investigates orthodox\nproof-rules, which are proof-rules without side-conditions, and it is\nshown that if one requires extended completeness using pure formulas,\nthen unorthodox proof-rules are indispensable in axiom systems for\nbinder-free hybrid logic. However, in the case of the the stronger\nhybrid logic including the \\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder, an axiom\nsystem can be given that only involves orthodox proof-rules. See also\nthe book Bra\u00fcner (2011a) for another axiom system for hybrid\nlogic as well as axiom systems for intuitionistic hybrid logic and a\nhybridization of Nelson\u2019s paraconsistent logic N4 (compare to\nCosta and Martins (2017) where another paraconsistent hybrid logic is\nconsidered). A survey of intuitionistic hybrid logic can be found in\nBra\u00fcner (2011b).\n7. Analytic proof methods for hybrid logic\n\nTableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction style proof-theory for hybrid\nlogic work very well compared to ordinary modal logic. Usually, when a\nmodal tableau, Gentzen, or natural deduction system is given, it is\nfor one particular modal logic and it has turned out to be problematic\nto formulate such systems for modal logics in a uniform way without\nintroducing metalinguistic machinery. This can be remedied by\nhybridization, that is, hybridization of modal logics enables the\nformulation of uniform tableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction systems\nfor wide classes of logics. The paper Blackburn (2000) introduces a\ntableau system for hybrid logic that has this desirable feature:\nAnalogous to the axiom system of Blackburn and Tzakova (1999),\ncompleteness is preserved if the tableau system is extended with a set\nof pure axioms, that is, a set of pure formulas that are allowed to be\nadded to a tableau during the tableau construction. The tableau system\nof Blackburn (2000) is the basis for a decision procedure for the\nbinder-free fragment of hybrid logic given in Bolander and\nBra\u00fcner (2006). This line of work has been continued in the\npapers Bolander and Blackburn (2007) and Bolander and Blackburn\n(2009). The paper Cerrito and Cialdea (2010) presents another\ntableau-based decision procedure for hybrid logic. Other decision\nprocedures for hybrid logics, which also are based on proof-theory,\nare given in the paper Kaminski and Smolka (2009). The procedures of\nthe latter paper are based on a higher-order formulation of hybrid\nlogic involving the simply typed lambda calculus.\n\nThe article Hansen, Bolander, and Bra\u00fcner (2018) gives a\ntableau-based decision procedure for many-valued hybrid logic, that\nis, hybrid logic where the two-valued classical logic basis has been\ngeneralized to a many-valued logic basis involving a truth-value space\nhaving the structure of a finite Heyting algebra. Hansen (2010) gives\na tableau-based decision procedure for a hybridized version of a\ndynamic epistemic logic called public annoucement logic. This is also\na major issue of the PhD thesis Hansen (2011).\n\nNatural deduction style proof-theory of hybrid logic has been explored\nin the book Bra\u00fcner (2011a). This book also gives a cut-free\nGentzen sequent system for hybrid logic. Cut-freeness is proved via a\nnormalizing natural deduction system, but such a result can also be\nproved directly, see Indrzejczak (2016). The natural deduction and\nGentzen systems of Bra\u00fcner (2011a) can be extended with\nadditional proof-rules corresponding to first-order conditions on the\naccessibility relations expressed by so-called geometric\ntheories (this is of course analogous to extending tableau and\naxiom systems with pure axioms). See also Bra\u00fcner and de Paiva\n(2006) where a natural deduction system is given for intuitionistic\nhybrid logic (Chapter 8 of Bra\u00fcner (2011a)).\n\nGentzen and natural deduction systems for logics similar to hybrid\nlogics were explored already in the 1990s by Jerry Seligman, see the\noverview in Seligman (2001). In particular, Seligman developed\nproof-systems that work with arbitrary formulas, not just satisfaction\nstatements, the latter being the case for most proof-systems for\nhybrid logic, where satisfaction operators are used to access\ninformation hidden behind modalities. A natural deduction system in\nthis style was introduced in Seligman (1997) and this system has been\nfurther developed in Chapter 4 of the book Bra\u00fcner (2011a). A\ntableau systems in Seligman\u2019s proof-style has been considered in\nBlackburn, Bolander, Bra\u00fcner, and J\u00f8rgensen (2017) where a\nsyntactic completeness proof is given. A semantic completenes proof of\nthe tableau system is given in J\u00f8rgensen, Blackburn, Bolander,\nBra\u00fcner (2016). Reasoning in these systems does not directly rely\non the global encodings that satisfaction operators make possible,\nhence, these systems can be considered more in line with the local\ncharacter of the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic. In fact,\nthis more local reasoning style makes these systems suitable for\nformalizing the perspectival reasoning taking place in certain\npsychological reasoning tasks, see Bra\u00fcner (2014b) as well as\nBra\u00fcner, Blackburn, and Polyanskaya (2016).\n\nAs mentioned above, the papers Blackburn, Bolander, Bra\u00fcner, and\nJ\u00f8rgensen (2017) and J\u00f8rgensen, Blackburn, Bolander,\nBra\u00fcner (2016) gave completenes proofs for Seligman-style tableau\nsystems for hybrid logic. Based on these results, completeness for\nthese systems have in From (2021) and From, Blackburn, and Villadsen\n(2020) been fully formalised using the proof assistant\nIsabelle/HOL.\n\nSome work in resolution calculi and model checking has been carried\nout, see Areces, de Rijke, and de Nivelle (2001) as well as Areces and\nGorin (2011) for resolution calculi and see as Franceschet and de\nRijke (2006) as well as Lange (2009) for results on model\nchecking.\n8. Quantified Hybrid Logics\n\nWe treat quantified hybrid logics separately. First-order modal logic\ncomes in many different versions, which also is the case with\nfirst-order hybrid logic. Tableau systems for first-order hybrid logic\ncan be found in the paper Blackburn and Marx (2002). Natural deduction\nand axiom systems for first-order hybrid logic can be found in Chapter\n6 of the book Bra\u00fcner (2011a) and Chapter 7 of the book deals\nwith natural deduction for intensional first-order hybrid logic. The\npaper Indrzejczak (2020) gives a Gentzen-style sequent calculus for\nfirst-order hybrid logic with lambda operators as well as existence\nand definedness predicates. The paper Barbosa, Martins, and Carreteiro\n(2014) gives an axiomatization of a fragment of first-order hybrid\nlogic called equational first-order hybrid logic.\n\nIt is remarkable that first-order hybrid logic offers precisely the\nfeatures needed to prove interpolation theorems: While interpolation\nfails in a number of well-known first-order modal logics, their\nhybridized counterparts have this property, see Areces, Blackburn, and\nMarx (2003) as well as Blackburn and Marx (2003). The first paper\ngives a model-theoretic proof of interpolation whereas the second\npaper gives an algorithm for calculating interpolants based on a\ntableau system.\n\nThe paper Areces, Blackburn, Huertas, and Manzano (2014) deals with a\nhybrid-logical version of higher-order modal logic (that is, modal\nlogic built over Church\u2019s simple theory of types). Axiom systems\nare given and completeness is proved wrt. Henkin-type semantics. The\npaper Blackburn, Huertas, Manzano, and J\u00f8rgensen (2014) extends\nthese results to encompass the downarrow binder and gives translations\nto and from the bounded fragment of first-order logic (see above).\n\nRather than introducing nominals as a second kind of propositional\nsymbol, Prior sometimes created them using propositional quantifiers\ntogether with the \\(\\mathtt{Q}\\) operator, defined as follows:\n\n\\(\\mathtt{ Qp = \\Diamond p \\wedge \\forall q (\\Box (p \\rightarrow q)\n\\vee \\Box (p \\rightarrow \\neg q)) }\\)\n\n\nHere the \\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{\\Diamond}\\) are the box and\ndiamond forms of the universal modality. The result of prefixing the\nordinary propositional symbol \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) by the \\(\\mathtt{Q}\\)\noperator, converts \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) to a nominal. To be more precise,\ntaking the propositional quantifier \\(\\mathtt{\\forall q}\\) to range\nover all sets of worlds, \\(\\mathtt{Qp}\\) says that \\(\\mathtt{p}\\)\ndenotes a singleton set, that is, \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) is a standard\nnominal. But there is another approach to interpreting propositional\nquantifiers, called the general (or Henkin) approach, where\npropositional quantifiers range over a preselected set of\nsubsets of worlds. Interpreted these two different ways, the\n\\(\\mathtt{Q}\\) operator gives rise to two different\n\u2018species\u2019 of nominals, and it turns out that these two\nspecies behave differently with respect to the rule of universal\ninstantiation. This is investigated in the paper Blackburn,\nBra\u00fcner, and Kofod (2020), which gives a tableau system for a\nhybrid logic with Henkin-style propositional quantifiers, containing\nboth species of nominals. The paper moreover describes how this\nformally-defined \u2018species division\u2019 corresponds rather\nwell with two intuitions about nominals that can be detected in\nPrior\u2019s writings. \n\nSince the mid 1990s, the work on hybrid logic has flourished. We refer\nthe reader to the publications in the bibliography for further\nreferences. Moreover, see the internet resources below.\n",
