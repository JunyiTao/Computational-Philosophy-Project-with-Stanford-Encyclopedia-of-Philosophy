    "main_text": "\n1. Orientation\n\n\nThe theory of divine illumination is generally conceived of as\ndistinctively Christian, distinctively medieval, and distinctively\nAugustinian. There is some justification for this, of course, inasmuch\nas Christian medieval philosophers gave the theory serious and\nsustained discussion, and inasmuch as Augustine gave illumination a\nvery prominent role in his theory of knowledge. Still, it is better to\nthink of the theory in a wider context. Divine illumination played a\nprominent part in ancient Greek philosophy, in the later Greek\ncommentary tradition, in neo-Platonism, and in medieval Islamic\nphilosophy. Moreover, it was Christian medieval philosophers, near the\nend of the thirteenth century, who were ultimately responsible for\ndecisively refuting the theory. I will suggest that we view this last\ndevelopment as the first great turning point in the history of\ncognitive theory.\n\n\nI understand a theory of divine illumination to be a theory on which\nthe human mind regularly relies on some kind of special supernatural\nassistance in order to complete (some part of) its ordinary cognitive\nactivity. The assistance must be supernatural, of course, or\nit will not count as divine illumination. It must be\nspecial, in the sense that it must be something more than the\ndivine creation and ongoing conservation of the human mind. (If this\nby itself were to count as illumination, then all theists would be\ncommitted to the theory of divine illumination.) The mind must\nregularly rely on this assistance, in order to complete its\nordinary cognitive activity: otherwise, an occasional mystical\nexperience might suffice to confirm a theory of divine illumination.\nBut a defender of the theory need hold only that we require this\nassistance for some part of our ordinary cognitive activities:\nhardly anyone has supposed that every form of human cognition requires\ndivine illumination.\n\n\nIt is useful to think of divine illumination as analogous to grace.\nJust as a proponent of grace postulates a special divine role on the\nvolitional side, so a proponent of divine illumination postulates a\nspecial divine role on the cognitive side. Grace is intended as an\nexplanation not of all human desires and motivations, nor even of all\nvirtuous desires and motivations. Rather, the proponent of grace holds\nthat there is a certain class of volitional states, crucial to human\nwell-being, that we can achieve only with special divine assistance.\nLikewise, the theory of divine illumination is intended as an\nexplanation not of all belief, nor even of all knowledge. Rather, the\ntheory holds that there are certain kinds of knowledge, crucial to\ncognitive development, that we can achieve only with special divine\nassistance. It is an odd fact that, despite the close analogy, grace is\nregarded not as a philosophical question, but as a theological one. It\nis an equally odd fact that, whereas divine illumination hasn\u2019t\ngenerally been regarded as plausible since the thirteenth century,\ngrace continues to be taken seriously by many theologians. Perhaps both\nof these facts can be accounted for by motivational psychology\u2019s\nrelative obscurity in comparison to cognitive psychology.\n\n\nFor most people today it is hard to take divine illumination\nseriously, hard to view it as anything other than a quaint relic. A\nfirst step toward developing a proper perspective on the theory is to\nsee it in its broader context, not as peculiarly Christian or\nmedieval, but as an assumption shared by most premodern\nphilosophers. A second step in the same direction is to identify and\nto take seriously the philosophical problem that drives illumination\ntheory. In large part, the theory has been invoked to explain rational\ninsight \u2014 that is, a priori knowledge. For much of the modern era,\nphilosophers have been preoccupied with empirical knowledge and have\nnot had much interest in this topic. (Recently, this situation has\nchanged notably; for foundational recent treatments, see Bealer 2000\nand Bonjour 1998.) To see how something like divine illumination could\nhave ever seemed at all plausible, one has to see how deeply puzzling\nthe phenomenon of rational insight actually is. One way of seeing\nthis, and of seeing how little we understand rational insight, is to\nlook at cases where something goes wrong. A recent biography of the\nNobel-prize winning mathematician John Nash describes his long period\nof mental illness, during which time he held various odd beliefs such\nas that extraterrestrials were recruiting him to save the world. How\ncould he believe this, a friend asked during a hospital visit, given\nhis devotion to reason and logic?\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable\nsouthern drawl, as if talking to himself, \u201cthe ideas I had about\nsupernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas\ndid. So I took them seriously\u201d (Nasar 1998, p.11).\n\n\nIn a case such as this we don\u2019t know what to do, because we are\naccustomed to give unhesitating trust to the deliverances of pure\nreason. But why should we trust reason in this way? Why should we have\nconfidence that others can come to share our insights? Where does it\ncome from? The theory of divine illumination attempts to answer such\nquestions. \n2. The Ancient Background\n\n\nWhat follows is by no means a comprehensive survey. Still, it seems\nuseful to begin near the beginning, with this remark by Socrates from\nthe Apology: \nI have a divine or spiritual sign which Meletus has\nridiculed in his deposition. This began when I was a child. It is a\nvoice, and whenever it speaks it turns me away from something I am\nabout to do, but it never encourages me to do anything (31d, tr.\nGrube).\n\n\nThis appears to be an entirely straightforward expression of a theory\nof divine illumination. It is not clear who is providing the\nillumination. Apuleius (fl. 150 CE) would later identify the source as\na certain kind of friendly demon, and argue that it was only fitting\nfor Socrates, the most perfect of all human beings, to receive such\nillumination (De deo Socratis, XVII\u2013XIX). (This idea that\nillumination comes to those who deserve it would be proposed by\nAugustine as well [e.g., De magistro 11.38], but abandoned in\nhis later writings as untenable.) As one might expect from Socrates,\nhis illumination seems restricted to the moral sphere. Its form is\nunclear: is it propositional? (see Phaedrus 242bc) Is it\nmerely the pang of conscience? (For discussion of these and other\nquestions, see e.g. the papers collected in Destr\u00e9e and Smith\n2005.) Whatever the details, Socrates is explicitly describing a kind\nof cognitive guidance that has a \u201cdivine or spiritual\u201d source. The\npassage may be an embarrassment to classicists, but it surely belongs\nin the same tradition as later medieval endorsements of\nillumination. \n\n\nNot all appeals to the divine involve this sort of direct\ncommunication. (Indeed, Socrates\u2019s reference to a \u201cvoice\u201d is quite\nextraordinary.) But the leading figures in ancient Greek philosophy\nwere equally committed to some kind of divine role in cognition.\nPlato\u2019s theory of recollection presupposes that the human mind somehow\nhas built into it a grasp of the Forms, suggesting that at some point\nthe soul must have received some kind of illumination. Indeed, Plato\u2019s\narguments for recollection anticipate the two lines along which\nmedieval views would later develop. The Meno focuses on a\npriori, rational insight, as illustrated by the slave\u2019s ability to see\nfor himself the validity of a geometrical proof. The Phaedo in\ncontrast focuses on universal properties \u2014 Equality, for instance, as\ncompared with two equal sticks (74a) \u2014 contrasting the changeable\nimperfection of the physical world with the exemplary perfection of the\nForms. Medieval philosophers from Augustine on, although largely\nlacking in firsthand knowledge of Plato, would argue for illumination\nalong both of these lines.\n\n\nAristotle too seems to invoke the divine. He describes the active\nintellect in this way:\nThis intellect is separate, unaffected, and unmixed, being\nin essence activity\u2026. It is not the case that it sometimes thinks and\nat other times not. In separation it is just what it is, and this alone\nis immortal and eternal (De anima III 5,\n430a17\u201323).\n\n\nThere is of course unending controversy over the meaning of this text.\nOne very common reading, in ancient times and our own, is that this\nactive intellect is something divine, not a human faculty at all. If\none then makes the further, natural assumption that the active\nintellect participates in ordinary human cognition, then Aristotle\nwould clearly be committed to a version of divine illumination. (One\nshould, however, be cautious in supposing that Aristotle\u2019s nous\npoietikos plays anything like the role played by the scholastic\nintellectus agens. See Haldane 1992.) Not everyone has been\npersuaded that this active intellect is something literally separate\nand divine. But even if one supposes that the active intellect is a\npart of the human soul, it is nevertheless difficult to avoid the\nsuspicion that some sort of special divine influence is at work.\nEverything in the passage cries out for some sort of supernatural\nelement in human cognition. \n\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (fl. 200 CE) was influential in pushing the\nseparate-and-divine reading of De anima III.5, and Islamic\nphilosophers (most notably Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 [980\u20131037] and Ibn Rushd\n[c.1126\u2013c.1198]) would later follow suit. Themistius (4th century CE),\nin contrast, championed the part-of-soul reading, and Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u20131274) would second this interpretation. A full treatment of this\ntopic would cover the later Aristotelian and Platonic traditions, Greek\nand Islamic. But here I will focus exclusively on the Latin West, where\nit was Augustine who played the decisive role in formulating the\ndoctrine of illumination. (For a useful survey of ancient and medieval\nAristotelian accounts of agent intellect, see Brentano 1992. On the\nlater Platonic tradition, see Gersh 1978. The Islamic tradition\ndeserves a full essay in its own right, covering not just names well\nknown in the Latin West, but also figures like Suhrawardi and Mulla\nSadra, central figures in the Islamic illuminationist tradition [see\nWalbridge 2005].)\n3. Augustine\n\n\nThroughout his long literary career, Augustine (354\u2013430) stresses the\nrole of divine illumination in human thought. One could choose almost\nany work to illustrate this point; here I will focus on the most\nfamiliar of all, the Confessions, where Augustine invokes\ndivine illumination constantly, and makes bold claims for its global\nnecessity: \nThe mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside\nitself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself\nthe nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord (IV.xv.25). \n\n\n\nNone other than you is teacher of the truth, wherever and from\nwhatever source it is manifest (V.vi.10).\n\n\nYou hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me\n(X.ii.2).\n\n\nTruth, when did you ever fail to walk with me, teaching me what to\navoid and what to seek\u2026. Without you I could discern none of these\nthings (X.xl.65).\n\n\n\nEven during the Middle Ages, Augustine\u2019s readers disagreed on the\nprecise nature of his theory. One thing that seems clear from these\npassages alone is that divine illumination is an influence that we\nreceive in an ongoing way throughout our lives. Thomas Aquinas would\nlater understand illumination as an infusion all at once at the start\n(see below), but this seems untenable as an interpretation of\nAugustine. The mind needs to be enlightened \u201cfrom outside itself\u201d; \u201cit\nis not itself the nature of truth\u201d; \u201cyou will light my lamp,\nLord\u201d (he has not done so already); truth \u201cwalk[s] with me,\u201d rather\nthan merely setting me in motion at the start.\n\n\nTo speak of this influence as an illumination is of course to use a\nmetaphor, one not likely to be unpacked fully. Our own minds present\nenough of a puzzle to us: when we try to understand how the divine mind\nmight influence our own, we must inevitably fall back on metaphor.\nStill, there are a variety of ways in which we might seek some\nclarification. In particular, it is helpful to distinguish two ways in\nwhich God might provide illumination. First, he might simply give us\ninformation of certain kinds, telling us how things are. This is how\nillumination is most often understood, at least implicitly. But a\nsecond possibility is that God would provide not the information\nitself, but the insight into the truth of the information. On this\nsecond model, we would frame beliefs on our own, and God would\nilluminate our minds so that we could see the truth. In other words,\nGod would supply the justification. It is clear that sometimes\nillumination takes the first form: much of Biblical revelation just is\nillumination in this sense. But Augustine\u2019s theory of illumination\nseems largely to be of the second kind. Consider this famous passage\nfrom the Confessions:\nIf we both see that what you say is true, and we both see\nthat what I say is true, then where do we see that? Not I in you, nor\nyou in me, but both of us in that unalterable truth that is above our\nminds (XII.xxv.35).\n\n\nAt issue here is biblical interpretation. When a reading is advanced\nthat seems clearly correct, how is it that everyone listening grasps\nthe truth of that reading? It is not that God gives us the\ninterpretation itself, but that he allows us to see that the\ninterpretation is true. \n\n\nThis understanding of illumination is particularly apparent in the\nDe magistro, where Augustine argues that only God can teach\nus. Of course, other people can tell us things, and can thereby\ncommunicate ideas to us. And we can believe what others tell us:\nindeed, our lives would be impoverished if we didn\u2019t regularly accept\nwhat others tell us. But all of this stays at the level of mere belief.\nIt is not knowledge unless we grasp with our minds the truth of what we\nare hearing:\nWhen I speak the truth, I do not teach someone who sees\nthese truths. For he is taught not by my words but by the things\nthemselves made manifest within when God discloses them\n(12.40).\n\n\nThe speaker\u2019s role is not irrelevant in this process. My words give \nlisteners an idea that they can then verify for themselves in light of God\u2019s\nillumination. Illumination is what allows us to go from mere true\nbelief to knowledge. Illumination provides justification. \n\n\nThis account is most attractive in cases of a priori knowledge or\npure reasoning, where we grasp through the mind alone that an argument\nis valid or that a conclusion is necessary. But there is another strain\nof thought running through Augustine, one that focuses on the mind\u2019s\nability to transcend the untrustworthy senses and grasp the truth that\nlies beyond mere appearances. The following passage is very often cited\nin this connection:\nEverything that the bodily senses attain, that which is\nalso called sensible, is incessantly changing\u2026. But what is not\nconstant cannot be perceived; for that is perceived that is\ncomprehended in knowledge. But something that is incessantly changing\ncannot be comprehended. Therefore we should not expect pure truth from\nthe bodily senses (Eighty-three Different Questions,\nq.9).\n\n\nIn one stroke, this argument rules out the physical world as an object\nof pure truth, and rules out the senses as a source for that truth. It\nmust be the mind, then, with which we attain truth, and that truth must\nbe something beyond the sensible world. Plainly, the mind cannot rely\non the senses. But what else is there? The conclusion we are invited to\nreach is that the mind must rely on God. \n\n\nOne might try assimilating this line of thought to those passages\nwhere Augustine has in mind necessary a priori truths. But it is more\nnatural to take this in a different way, as an account of how the mind\ngoes beyond the sensible data to a grasp of the real essences of\nthings. Accordingly, the theory of divine illumination would be put to\ntwo very different sorts of work in the later Middle Ages: as an\naccount of a priori knowledge, and as an account of concept formation.\nEach account raises its own set of issues. Taken in the first way,\ndivine illumination has to compete against the claim that the mind is\nnaturally capable of grasping such truth. Taken in the second way,\nquestions immediately arise about the nature of conceptual knowledge.\nDo essences (or properties in general) exist in the physical world? Do\nthey exist only in the divine mind? Do the senses play any role in the\nprocess of concept formation? Later medieval philosophers would handle\nthese issues in interestingly different ways.\n4. Thirteenth-century Franciscans\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s position would remain ascendant among Christian\nphilosophers for most of the Middle Ages. Thirteenth-century\nFranciscans, led by figures such as Bonaventure (c.1217\u20131274) and\nMatthew of Aquasparta (c.1237\u20131302), gave the theory a detailed and\nsystematic defense, focusing on the changeability and hence uncertainty\nof the human mind and the sensory world (see Marrone 2001). Bonaventure\ncharacteristically argues, \nThings have existence in the mind, in their own nature\n(proprio genere), and in the eternal art. So the truth of\nthings as they are in the mind or in their own nature \u2014 given that\nboth are changeable \u2014 is sufficient for the soul to have certain\nknowledge only if the soul somehow reaches things as they are in the\neternal art (De scientia Christi, q.4 resp.).\n\n\nCertain knowledge requires steadfast unchangeability. Since that can\nbe found only in the divine mind, and since we have access to the\ndivine mind only through illumination, certain knowledge requires\nillumination.\n\n\nThis line of argument came to seem increasingly old-fashioned as the\nthirteenth century progressed. The growing influence of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of cognition, as developed in particular by the Dominican friars\nAlbert the Great (c.1200\u20131280) and his student, Thomas Aquinas\n(c.1225\u20131274), offered an impressive picture of how human beings might\nbe able to achieve certain knowledge despite the changeability of mind\nand matter. These developments struck many Franciscans as a betrayal of\nChristianity. John Pecham (c.1225\u20131292), in a letter dating from 1285,\nwrites\nI do not in any way disapprove of philosophical studies,\ninsofar as they serve theological mysteries, but I do disapprove of\nirreverent innovations in language, introduced within the last twenty\nyears into the depths of theology against philosophical truth and to\nthe detriment of the Fathers, whose positions are disdained and openly\nheld in contempt.\n\n\nContinuing, Pecham criticizes the doctrine \nwhich fills the entire world with wordy quarrels, weakening\nand destroying with all its strength what Augustine teaches concerning\nthe eternal rules and the unchangeable light\u2026. (quoted in Gilson\n1955, p.359).\n\n\nAt roughly the same time, Roger Marston (c.1235\u20131303) writes of those\nwho, \u201cdrunk on the nectar of philosophy \u2026 twisted toward their\nown sense all of Augustine\u2019s authoritative texts on the unchanging\nlight and the eternal rules\u201d (Quaestiones disputatae de anima\n3 ad 30). \n\n\nMarston\u2019s view is particularly interesting because he proposes a\nsynthesis of Augustine and Aristotle. On his view,\nIt is necessary to posit in our mind, beyond the phantasms\nor abstracted species, something by which we to some degree attain the\nunchanging truths. I believe this to be no different than the influence\nof the eternal light\u2026. For the eternal light, irradiating the human\nmind, makes a certain active impression on it, from which a certain\npassive impression is left in it, which is the formal principle of\ncognizing the unchanging truths (De anima 3,\np.263).\n\n\nRather than dismiss the agent intellect as superfluous, Marston\nfollows Alexander of Aphrodisias et al. in treating the agent intellect\nas separate and divine \u2014 indeed, as God himself. Earlier in the\nthirteenth century, William of Auvergne (c.1180\u20131249) had in effect\nidentified the agent intellect with God (The Soul 7.6; cf. Gilson 1926\u201327, pp.67\u201372). Such cases illustrate how the\nvarious medieval disputes over whether human beings might share a\nsingle intellect \u2014 so absurd on their face \u2014 are in fact simply\nalternative formulations of the dispute over divine illumination. But\nthere were subtle differences among the various approaches. So whereas\nAuvergne largely turns his back on Aristotle, Marston is more\naccommodating. In addition to the divine agent intellect, he allows\nthat each human being possesses its own agent intellect.\n\n\nOn Marston\u2019s account, Aristotle and Augustine turn out to be\nentirely in harmony: each uses his own terminology to defend the same\ntheory of divine illumination (De anima 3, p. 258).\n\u00c9tienne Gilson (1933) has characterized Marston\u2019s position as\nan Avicennized Augustinianism (Augustinisme avicennisant).\nBut this label prejudices the case in favor of Aquinas\u2019s perspective:\nit assumes that Marston has been seduced by an Islamic misreading of\nAristotle, and it closes off the possibility that Augustine and\nAristotle might have more in common than is typically allowed.\n\n\nThe case of Peter John Olivi (1247/8\u20131298) demonstrates how\nprecarious a position the illumination theory held by the 1280s. Olivi,\na Franciscan whose work would eventually be condemned by his own order,\npresents a compelling critique of the Augustinian illumination theory\n(I Sent., q. 2), presenting his comments in the form of\n\u201ccautions\u201d (cavenda). The theory, he notes, is often very\nvague with respect to the actual process of illumination. And in\nrunning through the various possible accounts of the process available\nto a defender of the theory, Olivi appears to rule out every one. The\neternal reasons cannot represent things distinctly and specifically,\nbecause then we would have no need of any sensory input. But if the\neternal reasons give us information only of a general and indistinct\nsort, then at what level of generality? Does it supply us with\ninformation about species, or genera? If divine illumination is\nefficacious at any level, why do we seem to need the senses for all of\nour concepts? Olivi\u2019s questions and cautions go on and on. But after\nlaying an entire minefield of this sort for anyone who would defend\ndivine illumination \u2014 at ad 6 he rejects the Augustinian argument set\nout above by Bonaventure \u2014 he nevertheless comes to the surprising\nconclusion that he accepts the theory:\nThese things, since I don\u2019t know how to analyze them fully,\nI set out only as cautions. For although the stated position is in\nitself venerable (sollemnis) and sensible, it could\nnevertheless be quite dangerous to those who are not carefully\nsupervised. And so I hold the stated position as it is, because it\nbelongs to men who are highly venerable. Nevertheless I leave an\nexposition of the above to their wisdom (q. 2, pp. 512\u201313).\n\n\nThis was a favorite strategy of Olivi\u2019s: to criticize a theory\nfiercely, exposing seemingly devastating difficulties, and then to\nembrace the theory anyway, as a pious gesture of respect. It\u2019s hard to\nresist reading between the lines, and concluding that dusk was fast\napproaching for the theory of divine illumination. \n5. Thomas Aquinas\n\n\nThomas Aquinas is often thought of as the figure most responsible for\nputting an end to the theory of divine illumination. Although there is\nsome truth to this view, as we will see, it seems more accurate to\nregard Aquinas as one of the last defenders of the theory, as a\nproponent of innate Aristotelian illumination. \n\n\nA vivid example of the way Aquinas moves from an Augustinian to an\nAristotelian framework occurs in his Treatise on Human Nature\n(Summa theologiae 1a 75\u201389), where he considers the\nAugustinian claim that \u201cpure truth should not be looked for from the\nsenses of the body\u201d (84.6 obj. 1). In reply, Aquinas invokes the\nAristotelian agent intellect:\nFrom those words of Augustine we are given to understand\nthat truth is not entirely to be looked for from the senses.\nFor we require the light of agent intellect, through which we\nunchangeably cognize the truth in changeable things, and we distinguish\nthe things themselves from the likenesses of things (ad\n1).\n\n\nIt is not at all clear, here or elsewhere, how the agent intellect\ncarries out the two tasks he describes. (If Aquinas had given us a\nsatisfactory account of this, he would have thereby solved two of the leading\nproblems of epistemology.) But for present purposes it is enough to\nnotice how Aquinas seems to replace Augustinian illumination with the\nAristotelian agent intellect. Thus the traditional verdict has been\nthat Aquinas replaced Augustine with Aristotle, and exchanged\nillumination for abstraction. \n\n\nThere is more to the story. In the immediately preceding article,\nAquinas explicitly discusses Augustinian divine illumination, and\nreaches the affirmative conclusion that \u201cthe intellective soul does\ncognize all true things in the eternal reasons\u201d (84.5sc). Often this\naffirmative conclusion gets treated as little more than lip service to\nthe authority of Augustine, and the article as a whole gets taken as a\nbackhanded repudiation of illumination theory: affirming the theory in\nform but denying it in substance. This is a misreading. Aquinas sees\nsomething important in Augustine\u2019s theory, something worth\npreserving.\n\n\nAquinas does reject certain conceptions of divine illumination. He\ndenies that human beings in this life have the divine ideas as an\nobject of cognition. And he denies that divine illumination is\nsufficient on its own, without the senses. Neither of these claims was\ncontroversial. What Aquinas further denies, and what was controversial,\nwas the claim that there is a special ongoing divine influence,\nconstantly required for the intellect\u2019s operation. Aquinas instead\nargues that human beings possess a sufficient capacity for thought on\ntheir own, without the need for any \u201cnew illumination added onto their\nnatural illumination\u201d (Summa theol. 1a2ae 109.1c). From one\nperspective this makes for an important difference between Aquinas and\nhis Franciscan contemporaries. But from another perspective the\ndifference seems slight, because Aquinas is by no means removing God\nfrom the picture. Here is how he expresses his endorsement of\nillumination theory:\nIt is necessary to say that the human soul cognizes all\nthings in the eternal reasons, through participating in which we\ncognize all things. For the intellectual light that is in us is nothing\nother than a certain likeness of the uncreated light, obtained through\nparticipation, in which the eternal reasons are contained. Thus it is\nsaid in Psalm 4, Many say, Who shows us good things? To this\nquestion the Psalmist replies, saying The light of your face, Lord,\nis imprinted upon us. This is as if to say, through that seal of\nthe divine light on us, all things are shown to us (Summa\ntheol. 1a 84.5c).\n\n\nThere is some temptation to take all of this simply as an expression of\nAquinas\u2019s more general view that God is the first cause of all things.\nHe writes, for instance, \nAll active created powers operate in virtue of\nbeing directed and moved by the Creator. So it is, then, that in all\ncognition of the truth, the human mind needs the divine operation. But\nin the case of things cognized naturally it does not need any new\nlight, but only divine movement and direction (In de trinitate\npro. 1.1c).\n\n\nHere there seems to be nothing special about the intellect\u2019s need for\nillumination. The intellect, like all of nature, needs God as its first\nmover. If you like, think of this as divine illumination. But viewed\nunder this aspect, it is no wonder the theory was controversial. While\nhis Franciscan contemporaries were insisting on a special role for God\nin human cognition, Aquinas seems to move as far in the opposite\ndirection as his theism would permit. \n\n\nBut passages of this last kind are misleading, because Aquinas does\nsee something especially mysterious about human cognition, and he\nappeals to God as a way of solving this mystery. The agent intellect,\non Aquinas\u2019s view, accounts for our capacity to grasp self-evident\ntruths. We have an immediate and direct grasp of the truth of first\nprinciples, such as the principle of noncontradiction (see, e.g.,\nSumma contra Gentiles II.83.1678). We do not infer the truth\nof this principle, we do not discover that it is true through any kind\nof induction. Instead we simply see its truth, as soon as we are\nconfronted with an instance where it applies. This is not innate\nknowledge; we are not born knowing these principles. What we are born\nwith is the capacity to recognize their truth as soon as we are\nconfronted with instances of them. These first natural conceptions are\n\u201cthe seeds of all the things that are subsequently cognized\u201d (De\nveritate 11.1 ad 5). In this sense, Aquinas is even willing to\nspeak of the soul\u2019s having a prior knowledge of everything that it\nknows:\nThe soul forms in itself likenesses of things inasmuch as,\nthrough the light of agent intellect, forms abstracted from sensible\nobjects are made actually intelligible, so as to be received in the\npossible intellect. And so, in a way, all knowledge is imparted to\nus at the start, in the light of agent intellect, mediated by the\nuniversal concepts that are cognized at once by the light of agent\nintellect. Through these concepts, as through universal principles, we\nmake judgments about other things, and in these universal concepts we\nhave a prior cognition of those others. In this connection there is\ntruth in the view that the things we learn, we already had knowledge of\n(De veritate 10.6c).\n\n\nBecause all of what we know can be traced back to these fundamental\nprinciples, there is a sense in which everything we learn, we already\nknew. An innate grasp of certain basic truths, recognized by the light\nof agent intellect, plays a crucial, foundational role.\n\n\nThe light of agent intellect is of course given to us from God \u2014 \u201ca\ncertain likeness of the uncreated light, obtained through\nparticipation\u201d (1a 84.5c). Without appealing to God, Aquinas sees no\nway of explaining how we recognize the truth of first principles.\nNeither deductive nor inductive reasoning can account for the way in\nwhich we immediately see that such principles are true. This\ninsight, then, is simply something we are given:\nThe light of this kind of reason, by which principles of\nthis kind are known to us, is imparted to us from God. It is like a\nlikeness of the uncreated truth reflecting in us. So, since no human\nteaching can be effective except in virtue of that light, it is clear\nthat it is God alone who internally and principally teaches us (De\nveritate 11.1c).\n\n\nThe light of agent intellect, a likeness of the divine ideas, is the\nessential starting point for all knowledge. \n\n\nAquinas agrees with his Franciscan contemporaries that intellective\ncognition is incomplete without some sort of supernaturally infused\ninsight. The only difference is that Aquinas wants that insight to be\ngiven all at once, from the start \u2014 bottled up within agent intellect,\nas we might think of it. His opponents, in contrast, think of\nillumination as an ongoing process, as necessary as the air we breathe.\nIt is easy to see how, at the time, this difference might have seemed\nimportant. But from our present perspective the differences seem rather\nslight: they seem to be arguing simply over the means of transmission.\nAquinas conceives of illumination as a deep well within us, whereas the\nFranciscans conceived of it as raining down in drops. (This is a\nsummary of the account in Pasnau 2002, Chapter 10.)\n6. Henry of Ghent\n\n\nAlthough in a sense Thomas Aquinas defends a version of divine\nillumination, he in another sense clearly weakens the theory by giving\nit the status of an innate gift rather than ongoing patronage. In\nmaking for the agent intellect a central place in his theory of\ncognition, Aquinas has less room for illumination. As the thirteenth\ncentury progressed, philosophers and theologians were increasingly\nwilling to make this tradeoff. While the Aristotelian theory of\ncognition waxed, the Augustinian theory of divine illumination waned.\nTo combine the two seemed, in the words of \u00c9tienne Gilson\n(1930), \u201cunproductive and even, in a sense, contradictory.\u201d \n\n\nIt is this seemingly contradictory task that Henry of Ghent\n(c.1217\u20131293) took upon himself in the years immediately after\nAquinas\u2019s death. When Peter John Olivi remarked that he would accept\nthe theory of illumination because it \u201cbelongs to men who are highly\nvenerable\u201d (sec. 4 above), he would have had in mind among others\nHenry of Ghent, who would indeed become known as the \u201cVenerable\nDoctor\u201d (Doctor solemnis). Ghent was neither Dominican nor\nFranciscan, but a so-called \u201csecular\u201d master at the University of\nParis. His project was to defend an Aristotelian theory of cognition\nwhile at the same time reviving divine illumination in its traditional\nAugustinian form. To those, like Aquinas, who were arguing for the\nself-sufficiency of the human cognitive powers, Ghent replies,\nthis is true for natural things, as regards knowing what is\ntrue of the thing\u2026. Pure truth, however, or any truth that must be\ncognized supernaturally, or perhaps any truth at all, cannot be known\nwithout God himself doing the teaching (Summa 1.7 ad 1).\n\n\nOn Ghent\u2019s terminology, to know what is true of a thing is\nsimply to have a veridical impression of it: to represent a thing as it\nis. To grasp the truth of a thing, in contrast, is to grasp\nits nature. Only this latter sort of cognition counts as knowledge in\nthe strict sense, because only here are we getting at the unchanging\nreality of the material world.\nFor there is no knowledge of things insofar as they are\nexternal in effect, but insofar as their nature and quiddity is grasped\nby the mind (Summa 2.2 ad 1).\n\n\nFor knowledge of this kind, divine illumination is necessary. \n\n\nGhent\u2019s argument is interestingly different from that of Augustine and\nhis Franciscan followers. Whereas they had dismissed the physical\nworld as too changeable to be a fit subject for human knowledge, Ghent\nbelieves that pure truth and certain knowledge can be had of the\nphysical world, provided we manage to grasp the real essences of\nthings. Since we cannot do so on our own, we need divine illumination\nto go beyond sensory appearances, to have genuine insight into the\nnature of reality. At its most basic level, Ghent is offering a\ncritique of the agent intellect. Although he accepts the doctrine of\nagent intellect, he refuses to give that faculty the kind of efficacy\nthat it has for Aquinas and other medieval Aristotelians. Not\nsurprisingly, Ghent proposes reviving the earlier thirteenth-century\ntradition of referring to God himself as a kind of agent intellect\n(Quodlibet 9.15). The way Ghent would synthesize Augustine\nand Aristotle, in this area, is by identifying those aspects of\nAristotle that are incomplete and supplementing them with the\nnecessary Augustinian illumination. (This is a summary of the account\nin Pasnau 1995. All of Henry\u2019s important initial article from\nhis Summa on the possibility of knowledge is now available in\na translation from Roland Teske.)\n7. John Duns Scotus\n\n\nIt was the Franciscan John Duns Scotus, more than anyone else, who put\nan end to the theory of divine illumination. As Steven Marrone (2001)\nhas shown in detail, there were various authors at the end of the\nthirteenth century who were ready to reject illumination. Indeed, Ghent\nhimself gave illumination less and less attention in his later years.\nStill, it was Scotus who provided the most impressive and extensive\nphilosophical alternative to illumination theory. (As John Boler remarked\nin correspondence, \u201cas with Nixon\u2019s trip to China, it probably\ncould only be done by a Franciscan.\u201d) Scotus criticizes Ghent\u2019s\nargument in detail (Ordinatio I.3.1.4), arguing against\nGhent\u2019s own arguments, against the skeptical consequences that would\nallegedly come from giving up divine illumination, and against the\nviability of such illumination in its own right. With respect to the\nlast point, Scotus argues that if human cognition were fallible in the\nway Ghent argues, then outside illumination could not, even in\nprinciple, ensure \u201ccertain and pure knowledge.\u201d On Ghent\u2019s account, the\nhuman mind cooperates with the divine light in achieving such\nknowledge. Scotus replies: \nWhen one of those that come together is incompatible with\ncertainty, then certainty cannot be achieved. For just as from one\npremise that is necessary and one that is contingent nothing follows\nbut a contingent conclusion, so from something certain and something\nuncertain, coming together in some cognition, no cognition that is\ncertain follows (Ordinatio I.3.1.4 n. 221).\n\n\nIf one part of a system is fallible, then that fallibility infects the\nprocess of a whole. Scotus\u2019s startling claim is that if the human mind\nwere intrinsically incapable of achieving certain knowledge, then not\neven divine illumination could save it. \n\n\nScotus\u2019s own view is that the human mind is capable of such\nknowledge on its own. If by \u201ccertain and pure truth\u201d Ghent means\n\u201cinfallible truth, without doubt and deception,\u201d then Scotus thinks he\nhas established that human beings \u201ccan achieve this, by purely natural\nmeans\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 258). How can such a thing be\nestablished? How can the skeptic be refuted, without appealing to\ndivine illumination? Scotus distinguishes four kinds of knowledge:\n\nself-evident (principia per se nota)\ninductive (cognita per experientiam)\nintrospective (cognoscibilia de actibus nostris)\nsensory (ea quae subsunt actibus sensus)\n\n\n\nThe general strategy is to show that sensory knowledge rests on\ninductive knowledge, that inductive knowledge rests on self-evident\nknowledge, and that introspective knowledge can be defended as\nanalogous to self-evident knowledge. Scotus\u2019s implicit aim is to shift\nas much weight as possible onto the broad shoulders of self-evident\nknowledge.\n\n\nFor Scotus, the self-evident is the bedrock on which other sorts of\nknowledge rest, and so he does not attempt to locate some further set of\neven more basic truths. Instead, he argues that our self-evident\nknowledge is foolproof because of certain psychological facts. When one\nconsiders a proposition like Every whole is greater than its\npart, one immediately grasps that the terms are related in such a\nway that the proposition must be true:\nThere can be in the intellect no apprehension of the terms\nor composition of those terms without the conformity of that\ncomposition to the terms emerging (quin stet conformitas),\njust as two white things cannot arise without their likeness emerging\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 230).\n\n\nWhen we see two white objects we immediately grasp, \u201cwithout doubt\nand deception,\u201d their similarity to one another. Likewise, when we\ngrasp a self-evident truth in our mind, we immediately grasp its truth.\nOf course, we won\u2019t grasp the truth of the proposition if we don\u2019t\nunderstand the meaning of the terms, but in that case we won\u2019t have\ntruly formed the proposition in our mind. And in contrast to the\nanalogous case of recognizing similarity, there is no room for sensory\nerror here. The senses help us acquire certain concepts, but once we\nhave those concepts, the senses drop out of the picture \u2014 sensory\nreliability becomes irrelevant. Scotus offers the example of a blind\nman miraculously shown in his dreams an image of black and white. Once\nhe acquires these concepts, he can recognize as truly and infallibly as\nanyone \u2014 his blindness notwithstanding \u2014 that white is not black\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 234).\n\n\nScotus is unwilling to discard Augustinian illumination entirely,\nand so he articulates four senses in which the human intellect sees\ninfallible truths in the divine light. In each sense, the divine light\nacts not on us but on the objects of our understanding. By giving\nobjects their intelligibility (esse intelligibile), the divine\nintellect \u201cis that in virtue of which secondarily the objects produced\nmove the intellect in actuality\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 267). When\nthe human mind grasps a self-evident truth, it does so immediately and\ninfallibly not because the mind has received any special illumination,\nbut because the terms of the proposition are themselves intelligible:\nour grasp of a proposition \u201cseems to follow necessarily from the\ncharacter of the terms, which character they derive from the divine\nintellect\u2019s causing those terms to have intelligible being naturally\u201d\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 268). It is not that we are illuminated by the\ndivine light, but that the truth we grasp is illuminated.\n\n\nThis marks a turning point in the history of philosophy, the first\ngreat victory for naturalism as a research strategy in cognitive\ntheory. On Scotus\u2019s account, when we grasp some conceptual truth,\nnothing miraculous or divine happens within us: \u201cthe terms, once\napprehended and put together, are naturally suited (sunt nati\nnaturaliter) to cause an awareness of the composition\u2019s conformity\nwith its terms\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 269). It is of course God that\ngives the world its intelligibility, just as it is God that creates our\ncognitive powers. But what is new in Scotus is the idea that the mind is\nnot a special case. From this point forward, divine illumination would\nrarely be regarded as a serious philosophical possibility.\n8. Epilogue\n\n\nIt is easy to miss the significance of what Scotus brought about: in\npart because it now seems so inevitable, in part because Scotus comes\nat the end of a gradual trend toward naturalism, and in part because until only recently\nit was generally supposed that nothing of much philosophical importance\nhappened between Aristotle and Descartes. Yet if one looks at the big\npicture of our evolving philosophical/scientific understanding of the\nmind, then it is clear that something important happened at the end of\nthe thirteenth century. \n\n\nStill, Scotus\u2019s impact should not be overstated. Although divine\nillumination, so called, would no longer have many prominent\nsupporters, the tendency toward supernatural explanations of cognitive\nphenomena would survive well beyond the Renaissance. Descartes, to take\none prominent example, can speak of \u201ccertain seeds of truth which are\nnaturally in our souls\u201d (Discourse on Method 6, AT VI:64), and of \u201cideas implanted in the intellect by nature\u201d (Principles of Philosophy 2.3). In its details, the view is strikingly similar to Aquinas\u2019s: Descartes identifies these ideas as the basis of our knowledge of first principles; he holds that the ideas themselves\nare formed only in virtue of sensory impressions; he identifies God as\nthe ultimate source of these ideas. Moreover, if Descartes is playing\nAquinas, in modern dress, then as Henry of Ghent we can cast\nMalebranche, who argues that \u201cAll our ideas must be located in the\nefficacious substance of the Divinity, which alone is intelligible or\ncapable of enlightening us, because it alone can affect intelligences\u201d\n(Search after Truth, p. 232). Malebranche\u2019s remarkable view \u2014\nin support of which he quotes Augustine \u2014 is that all our ideas are\nseen in God. This is illumination theory, all over again. But by the\nseventeenth century the philosophical context has changed so\ndramatically that these modern developments must be regarded as a\ndifferent topic.\n",
