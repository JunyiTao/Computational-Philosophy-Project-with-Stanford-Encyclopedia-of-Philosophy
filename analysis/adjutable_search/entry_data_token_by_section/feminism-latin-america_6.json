Latin American feminisms, much\nlike Latin American philosophy, have shown concern over the\nauthenticity of ideas that have traveled from epistemic centers (e.g.,\nthe United States, Europe). However, unlike Latin American philosophy,\nLatin American feminisms have responded to this concern by developing\ntheories that attend to dynamics with which ideas travel and the way\nin which ideas are re-negotiated and re-signified as they move across\nlocations. Generally, the claims about the ways in which ideas are\nreconfigured as they enter new contexts emerge over concerns about the\ntravel of ideas in a North-South direction, which not only remains\nnon-reciprocal, but further signals the centrality of North America\nand Europe as the centers of knowledge production. Latin American\nfeminisms have critically argued against the general understanding\nthat ideas are formed in the \u201cNorth\u201d and travel to the\n\u201cSouth\u201d (Connell 2014). In order to defend this position,\nit is argued that the act of translating is itself a materially\nsituated political task that re-signifies ideas as they migrate into\nvarying contexts. The ideas that emerge in the Latin American context\nare themselves unique to the circumstances that generate their\nconditions of articulation. However, circumstance is not sufficient to\ncreate uniqueness; rather, the processes of translation involved in\nthe movement of ideas across hemispheres shift meaning.\n\nTranslation can be understood as any act of description,\ninterpretation, or dissemination. It is always caught up in power\nrelations that are configured by the asymmetries between people,\nlanguages, and regions (Lima Costa 2014a: 20). In the context of the\nAmericas, the movement of ideas occurs across asymmetrical power\nrelations. Ideas encounter roadblocks and migratory checkpoints as\nthey attempt to cross borders (Lima Costa 2014a: 21). As a result,\ndialogue across hemispheres mirrors asymmetries of power and has led\nto the mistaken notion that nothing originates from the Global South,\nbut rather is only imported into the region from the Global North.\nTranslation is made further complex by \u201ctheory brokers\u201d\n(e.g., academics, donors, feminist NGO\u2019s) that mediate the\nmovement of ideas (Lima Costa 2014a: 25). As ideas move, their\nmeanings shift, and their transformation is contingent on the culture\nor discipline that receives them (Lima Costa 2014a: 29). Hence,\ndiscursive migration is not neutral, and in the process, location\ncomes to frame how to understand the reconfiguration of ideas.\nThinking about translation through the matrix of discursive migration\nilluminates the way in which difference and power play a crucial role\nin how knowledge becomes legitimated across difference.\n\nPlacing translation at the center of feminist practices recognizes\nthat translation is both politically and theoretically indispensable\nfor feminist, anti-racist, decolonial, and anti-imperial alliances\n(Alvarez 2014: 1). Translation is framed as a translocal phenomenon\ninsofar as it does not involve a fixed location, but further links\ngeographies of power (e.g., national, local) with subject positions\n(e.g., gender/sexual, ethnoracial) (Alvarez 2014: 2). In this\nconceptual space, Latin America and the Caribbean are configured with\na heterogeneity of Latinidades within the United States and\nwithin Latin America and the Caribbean that exist and move across\nmultiple border spaces (Alvarez 2014: 2). Identities are formed in the\nnexus between borders, the spaces of intense confluence that\ncharacterize transmigrations across the region.\n\nSubjectivity is both place-based and mis- or displaced with the\nmovement of ideas. In this context, difference emerges as a rich\nterrain from which to engage others. For some, the difference that\nmediates speaking positions is always characterized by degrees of\nincommensurability as we can never be fully transparent with each\nother across conditions of alterity. However, the condition of\nincommensurability is not sufficient to abandon translation, but\nrather an imperative to hear others in and across their difference\n(Schutte 1998a: 61).\n\nOne method of navigating the conditions of incommensurability is\nrecognizing the complexity and diversity of speaking positions with\nwhich we engage. The term transloca has been argued to aid in\nelucidating such complexities of difference. Embodying both the\nprocesses of translation (\u201ctrans\u201d) and the\nmaterial effects of location (\u201cloca\u201d), the\ntransloca highlights multiple dimensions that shape\nconditions of difference (Alvarez 2014: 4). Following the claims about\ntranslocation, transloca as a subject position attends to the\nmovement of bodies, text, capital, and theory along the North-South\naxis as they produce new epistemologies for apprehending the\nglobalizing Americas (Alvarez 2014: 4). Translocas are\nworld-traveling translators, cultural and political mediators, and\nhence also agents of transculturation (Alvarez 2014: 8). The term is\nintended to illuminate the way in which subjectivity is forged in and\nthrough movement across hemispheres mediated by location and\ntranslation. Attending to the dimensions of hemispheric movement\nelucidates the conditions of alterity that generate\nincommensurability, but also puts into focus the way translation\nmediates the processes of identity formation.\n\nThe arguments in regard to discursive migration, translation, and\ntranslocas further capture the links among Latin America, the\nCaribbean, and the United States as part of an intertwined diaspora\n(Alvarez 2014: 7). The intertwining is one that stretches in many\nhemispheric directions and as a result, makes Latin/a America a\nheterogeneous epistemic horizon. From Latinas in the United States to\nAfro-Latinas in Latin America, the ideas produced at the borders and\nnexus between, in, and through hemispheres are best understood by\nappreciating practices of translation. Hence, to think through Latin/a\nAmerica as an epistemic locale, in its multidimensionality, requires a\npolitics of translation that can foster coalition-building across\nhemispheres in spite of alterity. If taken seriously, feminist\ntheories of translation demonstrate that ideas are products of\nhemispheric locations, incommensurable with their predecessors (local\nor imported). The discourses produced in Latin America and the\nCaribbean are not only alternative reconfigurations of ideas, but also\nruptures in political epistemic practices. They call into question the\nnotion that knowledge production is a naturalized feature of\nparticular places (Femen\u00edas 2007: 14). Thus, the traffic of\nideas generates new and diverse spaces from which to think about\nlocations of difference (Femen\u00edas 2007: 15).\n",
