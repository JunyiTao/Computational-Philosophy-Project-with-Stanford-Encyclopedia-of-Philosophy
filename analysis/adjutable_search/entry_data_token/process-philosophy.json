Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously\nchanging, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing\nreality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features\nare either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and\nderivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophy\nbegins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysics\nmarginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity or\nbecoming\u2014if it is the way we experience reality, how\nshould we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varieties\nof becoming\u2014for instance, the uniform going on of activities\nversus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have the\nsame way of occurring quite independently of what is\ncoming about? How can we best classify into different kinds\nof occurrences? How can we understand the emergence of apparently\nnovel conditions? Can we conceive of becoming or dynamic being\nindependently of space and time?\n\nWhile process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is\ncontinuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there\nare temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But\nthey take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior of\ndynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing\ninteraction of processes. In order to articulate a process view of\nreality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the\nstandard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the\nstatic view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of\npredicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that\nare exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what\nis from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical\nbias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as\na metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise\u2014pushing\nfor a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of\ndeveloping new explanatory concepts and providing arguments\nfor why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.\n\nProcess philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it has\nfull systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of being\nas becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporal\nexistence, the kinds of dynamic entities, including mental occurrences\nand actions, the relationship between mind and world, and the\nrealization of values in action. Some approaches to process philosophy\nare conceived on the grand scale and offer a full-scope metaphysics in\nthe form of a systematic theory or comprehensive philosophical view.\nOther approaches, especially more recent ones, take a more modest\napproach. They pursue the specific problems that the various\nphilosophical disciplines are engaged in while focusing on the dynamic\naspects of each sub-domain. Such process ontologies, process ethics,\nprocess epistemologies, process theories of mind etc. are\ncontributions to \u2018process philosophy\u2019 more broadly\nconceived as a research paradigm of philosophical inquiry. They share\nthe guiding idea that natural existence consists in modes of becoming\nand types of occurrences. \u2018Processists\u2019 agree that the\nworld is an assembly of physical, organic, social, and cognitive\nprocesses that interact at and across levels of dynamic organization.\nHowever, within that broad framework, process philosophers debate\nabout how such a world of processes is to be construed, how it relates\nto the human mind (which is another process) and how the dynamic\nnature of reality relates to our scientific theories. In consequence,\nprocess philosophers also differ in their view on the role of\nphilosophy itself and in their choice of theoretical style.\n\nProcess philosophy opposes \u2018substance metaphysics,\u2019 the\ndominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy since\nAristotle. Substance metaphysics proceeds from the\nintuition\u2014first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher\nParmenides\u2014that being should be thought of as simple, hence as\ninternally undifferentiated and unchangeable. Substance metaphysicians\nrecast this intuition as the claim that the primary units of reality\n(called \u201csubstances\u201d) must be static\u2014they must be\nwhat they are at any instant in time. In contrast to the\nsubstance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, with its typical\nfocus on eternalist being and on what there is, process\nphilosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as well\nas ways of occurring. In some process accounts, becoming is\nthe mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic\nbeings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoing\nself-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode of\nbeing of different kinds of dynamic beings and the process\nthat generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to develop\na taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),\nprocessists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysics\nwith a set of new basic categories. Central among these is the notion\nof a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it\n\u2018does.\u2019 This type of functionally individuated entity is\noften labeled \u2018process\u2019 in a technical sense of this term\nthat does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some\nof the \u2018processes\u2019 postulated by process philosophers\nare\u2014in agreement with our common-sense understanding of\nprocesses\u2014temporal developments that can be analyzed as\ntemporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each\nsuch stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any\nother. But some of the \u2018processes\u2019 that process\nphilosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this\nsense\u2014they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental\noccurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that\nrealize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby\nconstitute the directionality of time. What holds for all dynamic\nentities labelled \u2018processes,\u2019 however, is that they\noccur\u2014they are in some fashion intimately connected to\ntime, and often, though not necessarily, are related to the\ndirectionality or to the passage of time.\n\nProcess philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophical\nreasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, and\naction as fundamental features of reality. The perhaps most powerful\nargument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatory\nscope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,\nwe can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of\nentities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about\nour world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement to\nconsciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to\ninstitutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to\nclimate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results in\ncognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a\nprocess metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the\nmind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for the\nprocessist criticism of the focus on substance in Western philosophy.\nThe bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive\ndispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in\ntheoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static\nentities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures)\nat the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast,\nprocess philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language\ngroup and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the\ngreat schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process\nphilosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since only if\nwe re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to\ngrips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of\nartificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality,\nand investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope\nof moral obligation. Thus contemporary process philosophy holds out\nthe promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing\ntasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century. First, it\nprovides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics\nthat can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.\nSecond, it can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an\nintercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research\non global knowledge representation by means of an ontological\nframework that is no longer parochially Western. Third, it supplies\nconcepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected\ntechnology development, and enable the cultural and ethical\nimagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes\nengendered by the increased use of technology, especially\nautomation.\n", "toc": [{"#HistCont": "1.

Historical contributions\n\nThe history of process philosophy extends far into antiquity, both in\nEastern and Western thought. In the Western tradition it is the Greek\ntheoretician Heraclitus of Ephesus (born ca. 560 B.C.E.) who is\ncommonly recognized as the founder of the process approach. The few\nremaining fragments of Heraclitus\u2019 doctrine are often\ninterpreted as championing a philosophy of ubiquitous and radical\nflux, epitomized in the slogan panta rhei (\u201ceverything\nflows\u201d). But Heraclitus\u2019 claims are more sophisticated. To\nbe sure, the fragments contain an unambiguous commitment to ubiquitous\ndynamicity: \u201cthis world-order \u2026 is \u2026 an ever\nliving fire\u2026\u201d (Fr. 217, Kirk-Raven-Schofield). Whatever\nexists is a transformation of this cosmic fire, turning into\napparently stable forms of matter such as sea and earth (Fr. 218), but\nall the while remaining present in these apparent stabilities (Fr.\n204). Cosmic fire is the source of change of all observable\ncosmological and natural processes. Moreover, Heraclitus also\npostulates that all observable changes result from a\n\u201cstrife\u201d of opposing forces to overcome each other, thus\ncreating transformative power as the ruling condition of existence:\n\u201cwar is the father of all and king of all\u201d (Fr. 212).\nHowever, Heraclitus\u2019 reputation as the great proponent of\nradical flux (alteration at every instant) may be mainly due\nto the influence of his early commentators: Plato, Aristotle,\nMelissus, and Theophrastus. For one must not overlook that in the\nfragments we have from Heraclitus, dynamicity is tied inextricably to\nbalance or \u201cmeasure\u201d (Kirk 1951). While fire is postulated\nas an underlying pervasive cosmic factor that is creative and\nself-moving, the changes produced by fire happen in a regulated,\nmeasured way. Fire is \u201ckindling in measures and going out in\nmeasures\u201d (Fr. 217) and \u201call things are an equal exchange\nfor fire and fire for all things, as goods are for gold and gold for\ngoods\u201d (Fr. 219). Furthermore the opposing forces, which are\nmanifestations of fire, form unities of cyclical\nalternation\u2014\u201cday night, winter summer, war peace, satiety\nhunger unity\u201d(Fr. 204)\u2014that proceed within the limits of a\nquantitative measure (metron) reinforced by a\n\u201claw\u201d of nature (Fr. 226). The unity of opposites thus\ncreates an overall balance of reciprocity by cyclical transitions\nbetween extremes\u2014\u201cthese things change places and are\nthose, and those change places again and are these\u201d (Fr.202).\nThe \u201csame rivers\u201d are constituted by the regular flow\npatterns of \u201cdifferent and different waters\u201d which\n\u201cscatter and\u2026gather\u2026come together and flow\naway\u2026approach and depart\u201d (Fr. 214). Moreover, the unity\nof opposites also produces the dynamic arrest we know from \u201cthe\nbow or the lyre\u201d (Fr. 209), i.e., the motionless dynamic\npresence resulting from the tension of a \u2018backstretched\nconnection\u2019 (palintonos harmoni\u0113) pulling equally\ninto two opposite directions. In short, Heraclitus articulated three\nfundamental insights that became seminal in the history of Western\nprocess philosophy, despite the somewhat tendentious portrait of his\nthought in Greek antiquity. First, Heraclitus assigned to process or\ndynamicity the role of an explanatory feature, not only of a feature\nof nature to be explained. Second, he suggested that processes form\norganizational units and occur in a quantitatively measurable and\nordered fashion. Third, he contrasted dynamic transitions or\nalterations with dynamic permanence, and thus for the first time\nidentifies, and differentiates between, two basic\n\u2018Gestalts\u2019 or forms of dynamicity.\n\nThe direct counter-model to Heraclitus\u2019 explanation of natural\nchanges was the atomism of Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, who\nviewed matter as constituted by inert material atoms with permanent\nproperties (e.g., weight) and took natural developments to be the\nmacroscopic effects of atoms colliding and changing their spatial\npositions. Aristotle complained that the source of motion for these\ncollisions remained unexplained and developed a philosophy of nature\nthat includes a coherent account of the source of motion in natural\noccurrences, allowing also for explanations in terms of self-realizing\nand self-maintaining structural or formal factors. In\nAristotle\u2019s view an item in nature persists by the active\nexercise of a collection of capacities, a self-maintaining internal\nprocess organization (physis, or more generally\nmorph\u0113) that realizes a characteristic sort of\nfunctioning; by means of these characteristic types of functioning we\nsort entities into natural kinds. These kind-specific capacities must\nbe realized within a matter or medium (hyl\u0113) that\nsupports the relevant process organizations but that also harbors\ncounteracting, disintegrative tendencies, due to the fact that the\nelemental components of matter (fire, water, earth, or air) actively\nstrive towards their \u201cnatural place\u201d further up or down.\nIf Aristotle indeed took these active elemental tendencies as\nfundamental and allowed for elemental transformations as changes\nper se without an underlying substratum or prime matter (as\nargued in Gill 1989), he can be counted as a process philosopher. But\nAristotle also supplied in his characterization of substance\n(ousia) those aspects that subsequent history selected to\nform the basic tenets of the paradigm of \u2018substance\nmetaphysics.\u2019 In addition, substance-metaphysics could also draw\non Aristotle\u2019s classification of changes (kineseis)\ninto generation, destruction, alteration, and locomotion, since this\nclassification rests on a sophisticated doctrine of\n\u201cpotential\u201d vs. \u201cactual\u201d features that are all\nattributed to a static subject of change. Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between kinesis (in this context: change,\ntransition towards a goal) and energeia (in this context:\nactivity), on the other hand, must again be counted as an important\ncontribution to process thought. Aristotle\u2019s distinction is\nformulated in relation to agentively initiated changes and activities,\nbut the logical distinction arguably extends beyond actions to\noccurrences in general. Changes such as building a\nhouse or learning lead to an end (telos) that\nlies \u201cbeyond,\u201d and are incomplete as long as the end is\nnot reached\u2014\u201csomeone who is building a house, has not\nbuilt it\u201d (Metaphysics Theta 6). In contrast,\nactivities such as seeing or living well\nare ends in themselves and complete at any moment for as long as they\nlast\u2014\u201che who is seeing has seen.\u201d Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between changes and activities is significant in its own\nright, but even more seminal for present-day process philosophy, since\nit is the first attempt to classify types of occurrences in terms of\nlogical and linguistic features of associated expressions (see section\n3 below).\n\nThe history of Western metaphysics since Aristotle was mainly focused\non elaborating various versions of substance metaphysics\u2014in\nfact, as one might say with Hegel, \u201cthe history of [Western]\nmetaphysics is the tendency towards substance.\u201d However,\ninterspersed in this history of substance metaphysics are pockets of\nprocess thought, partly as supplementary elements to an otherwise\nsubstance-geared theory, and partly as independent\nprocess-philosophical explorations. For example, the neo-Platonic\nphilosopher Plotinus (204\u2013270) introduced the thought that the\ndynamicity of being is the \u201cemanation of the divine.\u201d\nThomas Aquinas (1225-1274), Aristotle\u2019s most famous commentator\nin the middle ages, kept some of the processual aspects of\nAristotle\u2019s scheme more clearly in view than later scholastics.\nRenaissance philosopher Francesco Patrizi (1529\u20131597) offered\nmereological descriptions of the diffusion of processes in order to\ndevelop a \u201cmetaphysics of light.\u201d G. W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) devised a fully-fledged process-based metaphysics,\npostulating as basic individuals so-called \u201cmonads.\u201d\nMonads are ordered sequences of states of affairs consisting of the\nco-exemplification of properties during some period of time. But\nmonads are not static: they are endowed with an inherent \u201cactive\nforce\u201d that engenders the transitions between states. Moreover,\nsince Leibniz took temporal relations to be \u201cfounded\u201d in\nthe properties of monads, states of monads are per se not\ntemporally\n discrete.[1]\n\nA special branch of process thought opened up in late 18th and early\n19th century German Idealism, when Johann G. Fichte, Friedrich W. J.\nSchelling, and Georg W. F. Hegel responded to Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nsystem of a transcendental idealism. All three of these thinkers\nalerted to the processual nature of the \u201ctranscendental\nsubject,\u201d and aimed to overcome Kant\u2019s incongruous\npostulate of unknowable \u201cthings in themselves\u201d by focusing\non the process by which the world of knowable appearances, including\nreflective reasoning, is generated\u2014this process, or so the\nargument goes, is the most promising candidate for reality in itself.\nHegel provided the most comprehensive and detailed elaboration of this\nbasic idea. He postulated that reality is the self-unfolding of\ndynamic structures or templates (\u201cBegriffe\u201d); among these\ntemplates external contrasts arise, which trigger self-modifications\nof the templates into more differentiated versions; these in turn\ncreate further external contrasts. The result is an increasingly\ninterrelated web of dynamic dependencies, and the \u201cmovement of\nreflection\u201d that drives the interrelated differentiations of the\ntemplates in the end reaches a dynamic fixed point. According to\nHegel\u2019s dynamic structuralism, self-unfolding reality\ndifferentiates itself into mental, natural, socio-cultural, and\ninstitutional processes, and, in fact, over time develops any possible\ndifferentiation, so that in the end reality occurs as the totality of\nall possible forms of mutual conditioning. Hegel argued that this\noverall \u201cmovement\u201d of gradual self-determination by\ninternal and external differentiation drives all actual and possible\ndevelopments according to its inner necessity\u2014reality is\n\u201creason\u201d articulating itself as and within the world.\nHegel called this movement \u201cdialectics\u201d and his\nphilosophical system was an attempt to work out the\n\u2018logic\u2019 underlying the total dialectical development of\nreality. Schelling claimed that Hegelian dialectics provides, at best,\na description of the development of constraining conditions on\nreality\u2019s self-unfolding. But, Schelling argued, the productive\ndynamicity of the process that is being constrained is neither\nincluded nor explained in Hegel\u2019s system, and correctly so,\nsince the latter is necessarily transcendent to conscious human\nthought. From the perspective of contemporary process ontology, the\ndevelopment of German Idealism between 1790 and 1850 in the debate\nbetween Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling displays in instructive ways the\nlimitations of a process metaphysics that puts the occurrence type of\nproductions center-stage and, in particular, understands\ncognition as a production: as a development with a product or result.\nAs pictures are the products of paintings, mental representations\n(thoughts, concepts) were taken to be the quasi-objects that result\nfrom the productive developmental occurrences of perceiving and\nthinking. When we conceive of an occurrence as a production, we\nseparate conceptually between the product and the process generating\nthe product. Thus, productions are precisely the type of occurrences\nthat prevent us from conceiving the dynamic presence of reality in\nitself as \u201cprocess and result rolled into one,\u201d as Hegel\nenvisaged. The metaphilosophical debate between Fichte, Hegel, and\nSchelling, which deeply influenced the further development of\n\u2018continental\u2019 philosophy from Nietzsche to Heidegger to\nDerrida and onwards, can be viewed as ensuing from the assumption that\ncognitions are productions of sorts\u2014if cognitions had been\nassigned another occurrence type, this specific metaphilosophical\ndebate could not have got off the ground.\n\nHegel assumed that the process of reality follows certain principles\nthat can be fathomed by philosophical inquiry. This thesis is the\nhallmark of speculative process metaphysics, which has a\nnumber of adherents also among later process philosophers but has been\nchampioned most explicitly by Alfred N.\n Whitehead\n in his \u201cphilosophy of organism,\u201d worked out during the\nearly decades of the 20th century. The basic unit of reality in\nWhitehead\u2019s system is an event-like entity called \u201cactual\noccasion,\u201d which is the procedural integration or\n\u201cconcrescence\u201d of processes of data transfer\n(\u201cprehensions\u201d) into unities that become new data. Each\nactual occasion is the growing together of the total available\ninformation of the universe at that time, according to certain\nprinciples, repeating and reinforcing certain patterns (\u201ceternal\nobjects\u201d) and thereby creating new ones. Whitehead\u2019s\nprocess metaphysics is arguably the most comprehensive descriptive\nmetaphysical framework we have to date\u2014as Whitehead\u2019s\nfollowers, past and present, have shown, not only can it be used for\nthe interpretation of familiar domains of philosophical concern, but\nit can also provide illuminating descriptions for scientific domains\nwhere other metaphysical theories have little to offer, such as\ndiscourse pragmatics in linguistic typology, the neuro-psychological\nfoundations of value judgments, quantum physics, or measurements in\n astrophysics.[2]\n By refurbishing Plotinus\u2019s idea of divinity coming about in the\nworld\u2019s becoming, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy also provided a\nnew impetus to the philosophy of religion.\n Charles Hartshorne,\n perhaps the most eminent American philosopher of religion of the\nTwentieth century, adopted and expanded Whitehead\u2019s ideas for a\nprocess view of God and developed the position of\n process theism\n in the style of rational speculative process thought. It is important\nto note, however, that while the early followers of Whitehead such as\nHartshorne and Paul Weiss embraced the speculative principles of his\nphilosophy, many present-day Whiteheadians are content to put the\nsystem\u2019s ontological concepts to descriptive use.\n\nOther proponents of speculative process metaphysics between 1850 and\n1950, such as Charles S. Peirce, Samuel Alexander, C. Lloyd Morgan,\nand Andrew Paul Ushenko, contributed two new motives for process\nthought, namely, the philosophical explanation of evolutionary\nprocesses and the philosophical explanation of emergence and\nself-organization. However, they also created an image of process\nmetaphysics that in the eyes of their contemporaries appeared\nmethodologically problematic. The first step of these\nprocess-philosophical enterprises seemed legitimate\nbusiness\u2014surely it was important to identify the limitations of\nmechanistic explanations in science. But it was the second step, the\nendeavor of drafting purely speculative explanations for the direction\nand the origin of emergent evolution, that went against the positivist\ntemper of the time. Such explanations did not sit well with the\nphilosophers who defined and shaped the \u201canalytic\u201d method\nin postwar Anglo-American philosophy. As they rejected any empirical\nclaims that would go beyond what was scientifically proven, and\nassigned to philosophy the more mundane task of analyzing conceptual\ncontents (as well as linguistic and social practices, and phenomenal\nexperiences), they increased the intersubjective verifiability of\nphilosophical claims. But in the course of this important\nmethodological revision the ontological categories of process\nmetaphysics were mostly thrown out wholesale with the bathwater of the\nspeculative explanations these categories were embedded in.\n\nNevertheless, twentieth century speculative process\nmetaphysics is paralleled by an analytic-interpretive strand\nin contemporary process thought. This variety of process thought also\nproceeds from the theoretical intuition that processuality, in its\nvarious modes, is the primary starting point for a philosophical\ndescription of the world or of reality, but does not speculate about\nhow reality develops. Here processuality either is a defining trait of\nthe basic categories postulated for the analysis of common sense and\nscientific reasoning, in the style of analytic philosophy; or\nprocessuality is conveyed in the network of metaphors selected for the\ninterpretation of human experience and the conditions of human\nexistence, in the style of so-called \u2018continental\u2019\nphilosophy. Often contributions to analytic-interpretive processism\nare also placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic\nversus continental methods in contemporary philosophy. The following\nexamples will illustrate this methodological openness of\nnon-speculative contemporary process philosophy.\n\nBased on their analyses of phenomenal experience, the investigations\nof the \u201creflex arc\u201d that were coming out of the psychology\nlaboratory, and an analysis of human social praxis, William James and\nJohn Dewey each developed contributions to a process-based pragmatist\nmetaphysics. James\u2019 process-based account of the self loomed\nless large for the history of process philosophy, until recently at\nleast, than Dewey\u2019s more comprehensive view. Dewey holds that\nall existents are events whose characters we determine by giving them\nmeaning in our interaction. For Dewey meanings are not abstract or\npsychic objects but aspects of human cooperative behavior\u2014in our\ninteractions with the world we create significances and thus determine\nwhat kind of situation occurs. Working from studies of social\ninteraction, George Herbert Mead added to process-based pragmatism the\nthesis that mind emerges from social communicative actions. On the\nside of \u2018continental\u2019 philosophy, Henri Bergson arrived at\na process metaphysics again based on an investigation of phenomenal\nexperience, like James and Dewey. But while Dewey and other\npragmatists put the process-character of being partly into the hand of\nhuman agents and their practical and theoretical interpretations of an\nongoing situation, Bergson argued that the process-character of being\nis precisely out of our cognitive reach, at least in so far as we try\nto conceptualize what we experience. As long as we understand\nconscious experience as a subject-object relation, Bergson pointed\nout, we merely follow the theoretical habits in which we have been\nconditioned by the substance-metaphysical tradition. However, when we\ncarefully attend to what we take in during conscious experience,\nespecially our self-experience, without forcing a conceptualization of\nthat experiential content or the act of experience, we find not a\nrelation and ready-made relata but an interactivity\u2014an ongoing\ninterfacing out of which world and self arise in our\nconceptualizations. In immediate, non-conceptualized experience we\ngrasp the dynamicity of this interfacing as becoming or the flow of\nduration (\u201cdur\u00e9e\u201d), but this felt dynamic content\nof our experience transcends what we can conceptually articulate. As\nsoon as we try to conceptualize what we have grasped in\n\u201cintuition\u201d we turn the continuous complex flow of\nexperience into a sequence of discrete units, into pluralities of\nstates of objects at locations that engender Zeno\u2019s paradoxes of\nmotion, and we transform our entangled being with the world into the\never puzzling opposition of a subject and an object.\n\nMartin Heidegger\u2019s early and late philosophy also presents an\nanalytic-interpretive contribution to process philosophy, without\nspeculative formulations of metaphysical \u2018laws of\ndevelopment,\u2019 but with a view to the metaphilosophical and\npractical implications of process metaphysics. In Sein und\nZeit (1927) Heidegger presents what could be called an\n\u2018adverbial model\u2019 of process metaphysics; based on an\nanalysis of human existence (\u201cDasein\u201d) Heidegger shows\nthat what the metaphysical tradition understood as entities or factors\nstanding in relational constellations\u2014e.g., space, world, self,\nothers, possibility, matter, function, meaning, time\u2014can be\nviewed as \u2018adverbial modifications\u2019 of Dasein, as modes\nand ways in which Dasein occurs, while Dasein itself is the\ninteractivity of \u201cdisclosure\u201d or \u2018taking as.\u2019\nSince Heidegger\u2019s \u2018taking as\u2019 is an understanding\nthat is ineradicably practical, his early philosophy bears certain\naffinities to the pragmatist tendency in twentieth century American\nprocess thought. In Heidegger\u2019s later work, however, human\nunderstanding is no longer the dynamic \u2018locus\u2019 but more a\ndimension of the process of being (\u201cclearing\u201d).\n\nWhile many twentieth century American process thinkers were influenced\nby Whitehead, some turned elsewhere or went their own ways. For\nexample, W. H. Sheldon championed a largely dialectical view of the\ndynamic nature of reality with process as a principle of conflict\nresolution. Wilfrid Sellars, one of the great figures in post-war\nanalytical philosophy, worked out what appears to be the first\nconsistently nominalist and naturalist system ever developed in the\nhistory of Western philosophy; this is often overlooked, however,\nsince the system relies on a process ontology that Sellars only\nbriefly sketched but never elaborated. Naturalism implies a nominalist\naccount of properties, Sellars argued, which in turn can only succeed\nif we take qualia to be aspects of processes\u2014by categorizing\nblue as sensing-blue-ly, we can make better sense of\nhow physical processes engender sensory contents (Sellars 1981). With\nthe envisaged process-based solution to the body-sensory problem,\nwhich in many ways anticipates current ideas of \u201cembodied\ncognition,\u201d Sellars could further suggest a new process-based\nre-interpretation of intentionality. Any kind of content, Sellars\nargued, from the lowliest sensory content in bacteria to the\nnorm-governed contents of conceptual experience to the contents of\nscientific theories, is nothing else but a way of\nfunctioning. Taking over from Sellars the idea that content\nis function, present-day functionalist theories of mind and cognition\ntypically fail to acknowledge Sellars and thereby miss the decisive\nelement for a successful functionalist \u2018reduction\u2019 of\nintentionality and the mental, namely, that the reductive basis,\nfunctions, are not static input-output tables but ongoing processes in\nnatural systems that realize, in this ongoingness, normative\nsocio-cultural practices (Seibt 2016). Recently American process\nmetaphysics gained another important voice in Nicholas Rescher who,\nlike Sellars, consistently pursued a systematic approach in\nphilosophy. Rescher made important contributions to all\nphilosophical disciplines; originally these were framed as components\nof a system of \u201cmethodological pragmatism\u201d and\n\u201cpragmatic idealism\u201d. In the mid-1990s, however, Rescher\nsketched a process metaphysical embedding for his system, using\nfamiliar philosophical terminology, and thus presented the first\nsystematic overview of the explanatory potential of a non-Whiteheadian\nprocess metaphysics that forfeits technical expenditure and operates\nwith a notion of process that is close to our common-sense\nunderstanding of developments. In parallel, since the past four\ndecades and with increasing intensity, researchers working in the\nintersection of ontology and linguistics, in philosophy of mind and\ncognitive science, in philosophy of biology or of quantum physics,\nhave addressed specific questions in these areas with greater\nattention to types of processes and processual structures. These more\ntargeted investigations will be taken up below.\n\nGenerally speaking, current Western process philosophy has abandoned\nall speculative aspirations and develops the descriptive,\nanalytic-interpretive strand of process thought (the exception might\nbe the use of process metaphysics in areas of philosophy of physics\nwhere physics itself is speculative, see\n footnote 19).\n While interest in processism most recently has increased in analytic\nphilosophy of science, of mind, and of action, process thought is\ncurrently also used to highlight productive affinities between the\ncontinental and analytical trajectories of twentieth century\nmetaphilosophical criticism of traditional metaphysics. Such\nanalytic-continental cross-overs enabled by attention to process can\nalso be observed in philosophy of cognition and in the philosophy of\ntechnology, often combined with alignments with the \u201c4E paradigm\nof cognition\u201d or \u201cpost-phenomenology\u201d, respectively.\nAnother more encompassing exploration across borders, a detailed\nhistorical and systematic comparison between Western and Eastern\nprocess philosophy (e.g.,\n Daoism)\n is an important task yet to be undertaken.\n2. Three tasks of process philosophy\n\nAs may have become clear from the brief review of historical\ncontributions to (Western) process philosophy in section 1, process\nphilosophy is a complex and highly diversified field that is not tied\nto any school, method, position, or even paradigmatic notion of\nprocess. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead) took organismic\nprocesses as their central model for a concept of occurrences that\ngenerate the internal and external coherence of an entity. Others\n(e.g. James) chose as their canonical illustrations individual\npsychological processes, or (e.g. Alexander) took evolutionary\ndevelopment as paradigmatic. Some process philosophers (e.g. Whitehead\nand Morgan) articulated their approach in the form of an axiomatic\ntheory and in close relation to science, while others (e.g. Bergson)\nworked from an almost mystical sort of sympathetic apprehension of\nreality and insisted that process metaphysics could, if at all, only\nbe expressed by means of a highly metaphorical use of language. Some\nprocessists (e.g., Roger Boscovich) championed a materialist position,\nwhile others endorsed idealism (e.g., Leibniz and Hegel). The\nhistorical overview in the preceding section also displays that the\ntools of process philosophy are not tied to any specific method of\nphilosophical inquiry, giving present-day process philosophers a broad\nspectrum of approaches with which to build their theories: by\nconceptual analysis (via informal and formal reconstructions of\nconceptual contents); by the integrative interpretation of scientific\nresults; or by phenomenological investigations. Similarly, while\ncompatibility with recent results of science is for many process\nphilosophers a privileged methodological constraint, others take\nscience to be merely an aspect of the more comprehensive philosophical\ndatum of cultural praxis.\n\nIn short, process philosophy is best understood as the effort to\nreplace a longstanding philosophical research paradigm, in a\nsense close to T. Kuhn\u2019s use of the term, i.e., to replace a set\nof longstanding fundamental assumptions that delimit the scope of\nlegitimate topics and direct theory construction. For example, process\nphilosophers assume that the only primary or basic ontological\ncategories should be terms for occurring entities, and that\ncertain formal theories\u2014for example, set theory\u2014are\nill-suited of themselves, without modifications, to express the\ndynamic relationships among occurrences. Or again, process thinkers\nhold that philosophical research may legitimately address\n\u2018creative\u2019 phenomena that cannot be described as the\nmodification of a pre-existing and persistent unit, such as phenomena\nof complexity or self-organization. What unifies contemporary\nprocess-philosophical research more than any other aspect, however, is\nits metaphilosophical aim to revise long-standing theoretical habits.\nGiven its current role as a rival to the dominant substance-geared\nparadigm of Western metaphysics, process philosophy has the\noverarching task of establishing the following three claims:\n\nClaim 1: The basic assumptions of the \u2018substance\nparadigm\u2019 (i.e., a metaphysics based on static entities such as\nsubstances, objects, states of affairs, or instantaneous stages) are\ndispensable theoretical presuppositions rather than laws of\nthought.\nClaim 2: Process-based theories perform just as well or\nbetter than substance-based theories in application to the familiar\nphilosophical topics identified within the substance paradigm.\nClaim 3: There are other important philosophical topics\nthat can only be addressed within a process metaphysics.\n\n\nContributions to current process-philosophical research typically\nfocus on (aspects of) only one of these three components of a theory\n revision.[3]\n More often than not, however, the larger purpose of the contribution\nremains implicit, which is one of the reasons why contemporary process\nphilosophy, especially non-Whiteheadian process thought, does not\nclearly stand out as a unified effort at theory revision. Process\nphilosophy currently presents itself as an internally diversified,\ngeographically and disciplinarily distributed phenomenon of innovative\nthought in Western philosophy. Accordingly, there are significant\ndifferences in how process philosophers approach claims (1)\u2013(3).\nIn the following the focus will be on arguments for claims\n(1)\u2013(3) within contemporary analytical process philosophy. The\nreader should thus keep in mind that the pointers set in the following\nsections are partially representative at best and need to be\nsupplemented by introductions to, e.g., contemporary\n Whiteheadian\n process thought and French process thought\n (Gilles Deleuze,\n Alain Badiou). In addition, pointers to process-philosophical\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion are all but omitted, since\nextensive and in-depth treatments are provided in the entries on\n Charles Hartshorne\n and\n process theism.\n\nIn order to support (Claim 1), two strategies have been pursued. The\nfirst strategy is to argue that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm\u2014especially the focus on discrete, countable, static\nindividuals and the neglect of dynamic aspects\u2014simply reflect\nthe cognitive dispositions that are typical for the speakers of the\nlanguages in which Western metaphysics were mainly developed, such as\nAncient Greek, Latin, German, and\n English.[4]\n The second strategy is to select a well-known argument for the\nnecessity of substance-based metaphysics and to show that it involves\na petitio principii. For example, consider Peter F.\nStrawson\u2019s widely accepted argument against the very possibility\nof process\n metaphysics.[5]\n Strawson\u2019s argument can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nFor objective and identifiable concrete entities to be knowable,\nthey must be (i) distinguishable from other co-existents, and (ii)\nreidentifiable for one or more members in a community of speakers and\nknowers.\nDistinguishability and reidentifiability are conditions of\n\u201creferential identification\u201d for a community of knowers;\nthey require a matrix for the emplacement of our experiential\nencounters with entities in a unified all-encompassing framework of\ncoordination.\nSpatio-temporal location provides such a matrix; in order to\nconstitute the space-time framework essential for interpersonal\ncommunication entities must \u201cconfer upon it their own\nfundamental characteristics. That is to say they must be\nthree-dimensional objects with some endurance through time \u2026\nThey must collectively have enough diversity, richness, stability, and\nendurance to make possible just that conception of a single unitary\n[space-time] framework which we possess\u201d (Strawson 1959, p.\n39).\nOnly one category of entities possesses these required features:\n\u201cOf the categories of object which we recognize, only those\nsatisfy these requirements which are, or possess, material\nbodies\u2014in the broad sense of the expression. Hence given a\ncertain general feature of the conceptual scheme which we possess, and\ngiven the character of available major categories, things which are,\nor possess, material bodies must be [epistemologically] basic\nparticulars\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\nIf this line of reasoning were correct, the substance paradigm would\nbe indispensable, and (Claim 1) above would be false. For it is clear\nthat any viable metaphysical theory must have room for identifiable\nindividuals that can be located in space and time. However, step (4)\nin Strawson\u2019s argument begs the question on two counts.\n\nAll of the conditions that Strawson requires in step (3) (diversity,\nrichness, stability, and endurance or transtemporal sameness) arguably\nare fulfilled as much by the entities that we conceptualize as\nphysical processes as by entities that \u201care or possess\nbodies.\u201d For example, William Penn (2022) recently argued for an\nexclusively process-based version of scientific realism\u2014already\nthe praxis of natural science, but in particular also the scientific\nmodels for the fundamental constitution of matter, commits to a\nthoroughly processual ontology without underlying \u201cbasic\nparticulars\u201d: the stability of recurrent dynamic patterns does\nnot entail staticity. Furthermore, one might argue that the entities\nwe conceptualize as processes are physically realized without being\nliterally embodied, and for some of them it holds that we can point at\nthem and distinguish them (\u201cthis trickle versus that\ntrickle\u201d) and re-identify them (\u201cthe trickle was gone for\na minute, but then it came again\u201d). In nature\u2019s\nspatio-temporal framework we distinguish and re-identify both\nthings and processes. That Strawson\u2019s argument could have\nappeared plausible is perhaps due to the fact that his illustrations\nfor processes are sounds and explosions, which are not, like many\nother physical processes, lasting occurrences with determinate\nlocation (such as fires, tornadoes, or waterfalls). The initial\nplausibility of step (4) may also derive from a core assumption of the\nsubstance paradigm, namely, the thesis that all processes can be\nontologically understood as modifications of substances. On this\nreductionist view, all processes are \u2018owned\u2019 and we\nidentify them via their owner: the murder of C\u00e6sar, the\nconstruction of the forbidden city, etc. But the fact that\nthese processes involve certain things and persons is merely one of\nthe aspects that an ontological interpretation of processes should\ncapture, and not a decisive one, since many processes (e.g.,\ntornadoes, lightening bolts, today\u2019s rush-hour in New York) lack\na proper \u2018subject\u2019 altogether.\n\nEven more important is the second question-begging element involved in\nstep (4) of Strawson\u2019s argument, for it displays the theoretical\nbias of the substance paradigm at a more fundamental level. Strawson\nsets up conditions for the ontological category or entity type that\ncan constitute a space-time framework and claims in step (4) (i) that\n\u201cthings that are or possess bodies\u201d can fulfill these\nconditions, and (ii) that therefore such things are\n\u201cbasic particulars.\u201d In this way Strawson turns a common\nsense concept, viz. \u201cmaterial thing,\u201d into a basic\nontological category without asking whether it is possible that what\nwe common-sensically call a \u2018thing\u2019 might not also\nontologically be interpreted in terms of a category from process\nmetaphysics (e.g., as a bundle of activities or, in a Whiteheadian\nfashion, as ongoing pattern of events). Strawson elsewhere rejects\nsuch an interpretation as \u201crevisionary metaphysics\u201d while\nmetaphysics based on material things or substances is\n\u201cdescriptive,\u201d but these adjectives are themselves in need\nof a convincing justification\u2014as long as an ontological category\nfully captures the inferential content of a common sense concept, it\nis as descriptive as any other.\n\nIn short, then, Strawson\u2019s argument fails on two counts. It is\nsimply not the case that material things are the indispensable basis\nfor a framework of knowable, uniquely located, re-identifiable items.\nPhysical processes of a suitable sort can accomplish this task as\nwell. Moreover, even if material things were the only candidates for\nepistemically reidentifiable items, it still would be an open question\nhow we should interpret things ontologically. To be sure, the rebuttal\nof Strawson\u2019s argument does not suffice to establish Claim\n1, but it keeps process philosophy in the running.\n3. Beyond traditional \u2018bifurcations\u2019: process-philosophical approaches to old questions\n\nThe best way to show that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm are not laws of thought is to dispense with them while\nworking out philosophical accounts that are anchored in a new research\nparadigm. Whitehead\u2019s philosophy still is the most\ncomprehensive, systematic, and detailed proposal for such a\nfundamental theory revision, but, as often remarked upon, the depth of\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophical revision does not make for easy\naccess. Accordingly, contemporary processists fall essentially into\nthree groups. The first group pursues the task of explicating\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy to the philosophical mainstream, e.g., by\nputting metaphilosophical issues centerstage (Auxier and Herstein\n 2017).[6]\n The second group adopts selected insights or elements of\nWhitehead\u2019s scheme, partly without attribution, in order to work\nout, in mainstream terminology, a solution to a specific problem. The\nthird group develops distinctly non-Whiteheadian routes into process\nphilosophy, guided by research in linguistics or new branches and\nresults of science. In the following the focus will be on the third\ngroup, with occasional pointers to contributions to the second.\n\nThe last mentioned research line in contemporary analytical process\nphilosophy takes its departure from mid-20th century philosophical and\nlinguistic research on discourse about occurrences. Zeno Vendler\n(1957) and Anthony Kenny (1963) argued that actions can be sorted into\nvarious types according to certain logical and linguistic features of\nverbs denoting these actions. The resulting classifications of\n\u201caction types\u201d are similar, but Vendler\u2019s fourfold\ndivision operated with fewer criteria and thus proved more\ninfluential: whether a \u201cverb\u201d denotes a\n\u201cstate\u201d, \u201cactivity\u201d,\n\u201caccomplishment\u201d, or \u201cachievement\u201d depends on\nwhether in present tense the progressive form needed, whether it can\nbe combined with the verb \u201cfinish,\u201d or whether it applies\nan any moment of a temporal interval at which it applies. Certain\nproblems with Vendler\u2019s and Kenny\u2019s classifications were\nfirst noted by linguists Henk Verkuyl (1972) and Barry Taylor (1977).\nMost seminal, however, was Alexander Mourelatos\u2019 (1978)\nobservation that the distinctions that Vendler and Kenny tried to\ncapture do not pertain to the lexical semantics of \u201caction\nverbs\u201d but to the semantics of entire sentences, and not of\nsentences about actions but about occurrences in general. This renders\nthe classificatory task much more complex than Vendler and Kenny\nenvisaged. Since then the linguistic discussion has produced (under\nthe keywords \u201cAktionsart,\u201d \u201cverbal aspect,\u201d\nand \u201caspectuality\u201d) a plethora of theories about the many\ndifferent ways in which natural languages express the dynamic aspects\nof a situation. These linguistic theories provide essential data for\nanalytical process ontology, but one must not overlook that there are\nlanguage-specific interplays between verb semantics, tense system, and\naspectual meanings, and that ontology should be guided by inferential\ndifferences that hold across\n languages.[7]\n\nInformed by these early inquiries into the inferential characteristics\nof occurrence types, analytical process ontologists have offered\nvarious criteria sets for the classification of occurrences and their\nrelationships to other categories: some promote a division between\nongoing (\u201cprocesses\u201d) and completed (\u201cevents\u201d)\noccurrences, while others argue that ongoing occurrences should be\ndistinguished further into non-developmental and developmental\n processes.[8]\n There is also considerable disagreement on how to categorize these\noccurrence types: are they concrete or abstract? Are they particular\nor general entities? Mourelatos also showed that the logical criteria\nof Vendler\u2019s and Kenny\u2019s classifications actually function\nin two ways: they can be used to distinguish various types of\noccurrences such as processes and events, but they also highlight\ninferential analogies between processes and stuffs on the one hand,\nand events and things on the other hand. Most analytical processists\ncharacterize processes (or which ever label is used for the basic\ncategory) as dynamic individuals that are concrete particulars or else\nare abstract general patterns. By contrast, heeding the inferential\nanalogies in our reasoning about activities and stuffs, \u201cGeneral\nProcess Theory\u201d rejects the presupposition that concrete\nindividuals need to be particulars: \u201cgeneral processes\u201d\n(or \u201cdynamics\u201d) are introduced as a new ontological\ncategory of concrete, dynamic entities that are non-particular (i.e.,\npossibly multiply occurrent in space and time), determinable, and\n\u201cfunctionally individuated\u201d (by contextually determined\nsections of process\n networks).[9]\n However, both particularist and non-particularist interpretations\nagree that processes cannot be individuated in terms of their\nspacetime location alone and cannot be identified with\nmaterially filled space-time regions, thus parting company with\n\u201cfour-dimensionalism,\u201d (a position in contemporary\nontology that is occasionally misunderstood as a process-based\napproach). Furthermore, while processists agree that processes combine\nand that they exhibit common features, there is disagreement on how to\narticulate such process combinations (e.g., by a special mereology),\nand whether the shared patterns of processes belong into a different\ncategory (as Whitehead suggested) or are themselves processes as\nwell.\n\nIn short, analytical process philosophy has worked out concepts and\ntheories of its own, however pedestrian and patchwork, as an\nalternative to Whitehead\u2019s sophisticated system of categories,\nand there is a multitude of approaches within analytical process\nontology. Besides different classifications of occurrences and\ndifferent ontological characterizations of processes, there appear to\nbe two research lines, one with focus on the role of processes in the\nphilosophy of time, action, or experience (see e.g. the work of Antony\nGalton, Rowland Stout, and Helen Steward), and one with focus on the\nrole of processes in scientific reasoning (see section 4 below).\nDespite all differences in constructive detail, however, Whiteheadian\nand non-Whiteheadian process philosophy both recommend themselves as\ngateways to renovating philosophical discourse by deconstructing\ntraditional dichotomies. Here are just a few of the topics where\nprocessists promise philosophical advance.\n\n(i) Beginning with a familiar Whiteheadian move, the rejection of the\ntraditional \u201cbifurcation of nature\u201d into a physical and a\nmental domain, the process approach opens up new ways of looking at a\nwide variety of issues, and in particular on the relationship between\nmind and nature. Whiteheadians argue that the traditional mind-body\nproblem dissolves if all basic constituents of reality are short-lived\nprocesses of information transfer that exhibit both\n\u2018mental\u2019 and \u2018physical\u2019 aspects in different\naccentuations according to context. Quite independently of\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy and commitments to panpsychism, a number\nof analytical philosophers have argued that the present-day debate in\nphilosophy of mind and philosophy of action has been hampered by an\nontology that is focused on upshots (states, and state-like events)\nand promote a theoretical \u2018Gestalt\u2019 switch in the\nmetaphysics of experience and agency (Stout 2017). Helen Steward\n(1997, 2012) criticizes the standard conception of perception and\nagency as a causal sequence of states, some of which are physical and\nsome mental; in order to make room for agentive freedom within the\nnatural world Steward proposes that we view agency as a special form\nof downward causation, taking our bearings from the hierarchical\nsystems of functioning in biological organisms (2017). Others have\npointed out that our common sense (teleological) explanations of\nactions commit us to ongoing occurrences (Stout 1996) or that we can\nbest make sense of the unity of our experience if we take processes to\nbe the objects of our experiences rather than states or things\n(Soteriou\n 2013).[10]\n The so-called \u201cdynamical hypothesis\u201d in cognitive science\n(Van Gelder 2000) generated a line of philosophical research on\ndynamic models of the mind that is strongly guided by scientific\nresearch, especially by cognitive science using a connectionist model\nof the mind (see below).\n\n(ii) Similarly, as non-Whiteheadian analytical processists have\npointed out, process metaphysics reconfigures the traditional problem\nof universals since it abandons the substance-metaphysical principle\nthat concrete entities are fully determinate while general or\nindeterminate entities are abstract (i.e., they must not be, undergo,\nor initiate\n changes).[11]\n\n(iii) Processists also have offered novel approaches to the problem of\npersistence, either by taking persistent entities to be\n\u201cenduring\u201d patterns of processes (Whitehead), or by\nquestioning the idea that \u201cperdurance\u201d vs.\n\u201cendurance\u201d accounts of persistence form a theoretically\nnecessary exclusive\n dichotomy.[12]\n\n(iv) The dichotomy of \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018norm,\u2019 some\nprocessists argue, is another traditional \u201cbifurcation\u201d\nthat can be bridged. Some natural processes realize a certain form of\nlow-degree normativity. In some process organizations (e.g.,\nfar-from-equilibrium systems) each component process presupposes every\nother for its own occurrence; in the context of these particular\nprocess organizations the dependence amongst the single processes is\nnot merely a matter of linear causation but constrained by the\nsimultaneous interactions of the entire system, ensuring that each\nprocess is \u2018functional for\u2019 the occurrence of the\n system.[13]\n\n(v) Finally, the process approach also can be used to sidestep\ntraditional dichotomies in the philosophy of religion. While the\nopposition between \u201cimmanence\u201d and\n\u201ctranscendence\u201d traditionally is taken to amount to an\nexclusive alternative, whether in application to universals or to God,\nthe tools of process metaphysics allow us to pursue a third option\nthat exploits the explanatory grammar of the \u2018mode.\u2019 We\noften consider the mode or way in which a process, or collection of\nprocesses, occurs as a separate kind of process (compare, e.g.,\nscratching a violin string with a bow vs. playing a tone on the\nviolin; or a free market economy vs. a planned economy). Processes\nthat are modifications of other processes are both immanent in the\nsense that they affect (by constraining and enabling) how the modified\nprocesses occur, but are transcendent in the sense that they are\nmultiply realizable, that is, they are not themselves dependent on the\nparticular spatio-temporal occurrences of the processes that realize\n them.[14]\n\nIn addition, there is a host of other contemporary issues where\nattention to processes generates novel answers that advance our\nunderstanding of the familiar questions of philosophy in important\nways, even without challenging some central, defining, dichotomy.\nCases in point are the \u2018process account of causation\u2019\n(Salmon 1984,\n 1997)[15]\n or N. Rescher\u2019s processist analysis of knowledge. Offering\ndetailed reconstructions of the procedures of knowledge production,\nRescher argues that rational inquiry, including science, is the\nprocess of creating coherent theories that systematize what we have\nestablished as data with increasing complexity (Rescher 1982). That\nthis method of inquiry can yield (temporary) truths is justified by\nits practical success, but the method is essentially (a) interminable\nand (b) progressive, since: (a1) each knowledge claim contains\npresuppositions that raise new questions; (a2) reality is\n\u201ccognitively inexhaustible\u201d; and (b) since the increasing\ncomplexification of scientific knowledge can count as cognitive\nprogress, even though such progress may not be discernible as\ncumulative or linear advance (Rescher 1977, 1978, 1984). For claims\n(a2) and (b) Rescher supplies process-metaphysical underpinnings,\nendorsing a view of nature as continuously evolving and a view of\nevolution as directed towards increasing complexity (Rescher 1996,\n2006 ch. 10, and 2012; see also below section 6).\n\nPerhaps the clearest example for the progress that a processist\napproach can bring to longstanding tasks of philosophy is in the\ntheory of selfhood and personhood. Whatever cultural notions of\n\u2018person\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 we may have acquired, our\nimmediate self-awareness reveals us to ourselves as engaged in doings\nand undergoings. What we find ourselves to be doing and undergoing we\nunderstand as belonging to a space of possible occurrences. We notice\npatterns in what might possibly be going on with us, and some of these\npatterns we use to identify ourselves: in terms of our talents,\nskills, capabilities, traits, dispositions, habits, inclinations, and\ntendencies to action and inaction. It is integral to your\nself-awareness at this moment that your reading is yours, the\nreading of a self that is the same over time. But the sameness of this\nself we experience not as the sameness of a time-invariant thing but\nas the sameness of an \u2018operation\u2019 of integration\u2014an\nongoing unification of experienced patterns in ways that enable a\nfirst-person perspective. Some process philosophers have taken the\nexperience of dynamic sameness in self-experience as the basis for\nconstructing a process-metaphysical account of personhood that defines\nthe core self as a unified manifold of actions and capacities,\ntendencies, and dispositions to (physical or psychical) actions (see\ne.g. Rescher 1996 ch.6). In this way they preserve a concept of\npersonhood that renders the self or ego experientially accessible. The\nunity of a person is a unity of experience\u2014the coalescence of\nall of one\u2019s diverse micro-experiences as part of one unified\nmacro-process. Importantly, processists do not equate the\ncross-temporal unity of a person-process with a sequence of momentary\ntotal states of consciousness, as neo-Humean accounts currently\npostulate; rather, it is the sort of unity of process that links each\nminute\u2019s happenings into a single overall journey. From the\nprocess point of view a self just is the complex process\ncomposed of various physical interactions, experiences, feelings,\nmoods, and actions in their systemic interrelationship. The whole\nindividual person is continuously \u2018in the making\u2019 or being\nconstituted, yet it also continuously influences which components\n(e.g., experiences, feelings, actions) enter into the constitution of\nthe whole and in which ways these components occur. Such circular\ndependencies between a whole and its parts cannot be accommodated\nwithin a theory of individuals that is committed to the basic\nconstructional principles of the substance paradigm, especially the\nclaim that concrete individuals are fully determinate. Relationships\nof mutual constitution are legitimate theoretical tools within process\nontologies where entangled recursive definitions are not in conflict\nwith basic tenets about individual entities. By extending the dynamic\ndependencies among the component processes of a self to include\naspects of the person\u2019s physical and social context, a process\naccount of persons can formulate in a differentiated and\nscientifically informed fashion various claims about the formative\nrole of our\n environments.[16]\n\nHarking back to (Claim 2) and (Claim 3) above, extant process-geared\ntreatments of familiar topics surely provide considerable support for\nthe claim that process philosophy is viable (Claim 2). But in the eyes\nof many processists (Claim 3) matters most\u2014as the next section\nwill sketch, currently it may be process philosophy\u2019s primary\nasset that it enables us to articulate and address important new\nquestions raised by modern science.\n4. Tracking science: new topics for process philosophy\n\nThe relationship to science and technology appears to mark a\ndistinctive difference between continental process philosophy\n(Heidegger, Deleuze, Badiou) on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\nearly American process philosophy (Peirce, James, Dewey, Whitehead,\nMead) as well as current analytical process thought. While the former\ndevelops a critical point of view to reflect on the enterprises of\nscience and technology as cultural objects, the latter aligns its\ninvestigations with the aims and results of science and technology,\noften with an explicit commitment to naturalism. In fact, the early\nphase of process philosophy in America was mainly motivated by an\neffort to come to terms with the far-reaching philosophical\nimplications of the Darwinian theory of evolution. For these early\nAmerican process thinkers evolution was an emblematic and paradigmatic\nprocess\u2014it seemed to provide a clear template for understanding\nhow novelty and innovation come into both the human world and the\nworld of nature. The evolutionary framework calls for a new\nmetaphysics, the American pragmatists argued, which could articulate\nthe pervasive role of process and of the passage of time. Was there a\nvehicle or substance that could \u2018carry\u2019 physical,\nbiological, and cosmic evolution? If neither individuals nor types\n(species) of things are time-invariant, a new account of being was\nneeded that had room for the emergence of novelty in nature, and could\nconvey a sense of human existence as both \u201cprecarious and\nstable\u201d (Dewey). The idea that evolution was a fact that\nphilosophy had to accommodate explains many of the elements of early\nAmerican process thought, in particular the understanding of\ndynamicity as a force of creating novelty, as well as the need to take\na stance on the question whether the overall process of reality is\ndirected or blind\u2014which ultimately split the group (see section\n6).\n\nPresent-day contributions to analytical process philosophy are no\nlonger driven by an attempt of making sense of evolution. However,\nthey are often still motivated by the view that there are certain\nresults in science that philosophy simply must come to grips with, and\nif this task involves a fundamental revision of the standard tools of\nphilosophy, then philosophy should provide new conceptual tools. For\nquite some time researchers in the philosophy of biology and in the\nphilosophy of chemistry have argued that process-based or\nprocess-geared approaches yield better ontological descriptions of\nthese domains, i.e., better capture the inferential content of the\nbasic concepts of biology and\n chemistry.[17]\n The case of biology provides particularly strong empirical\nmotivations for a \u2018process turn,\u2019 as witnessed by a recent\ncollection of research in philosophy of biology that deserves special\nattention since most of its contributors do not proceed from but\narrive at process-ontological theses (Nicholson and Dupr\u00e9\n2018). As the editors point out, metabolism, lifecycles, and\ninterdependencies between genetics and ecology\u2014that is,\nprocesses that occur both at the level of cell biology as well as at\nthe level of multicellular organism\u2014present three classes of\nbiological phenomena that in different ways dismantle\nsubstance-ontological presumptions; these phenomena call for an\nontology that treats transtemporal sameness as a time-scale dependent\nfeature of process systems and models organisms no longer as\nindependent and comparatively discrete substances but as a complex\nnetwork of internal and external\n interactions.[18]\n\nBeyond chemistry and biology there are other scientific domains where\nscientific progress suggests process-ontological redescriptions since\nthe conceptual contents of the relevant scientific terms cannot,\nwithout problematic distortions, be analyzed in terms of the\ncategories of substance metaphysics. However, there are also\nscientific domains and topics that directly imply a\nprocess-ontological interpretation since the researchers working in\nthese areas already have adopted processist idioms in their informal\nglosses of mathematical descriptions and in their heuristic approach\nto the domain. Cases in point for a \u2018process turn\u2019 within\nscience itself are (i) quantum physics, (ii) self-organization, and,\nmost recently, (iii) cognition.\n\n(i) Quantum-physical processes: When Whitehead turned from\nmathematics to philosophy, he was quite aware that recent developments\nin physics (the demise of classical atomism in the face of quantum\ntheory and relativity theory) had thrown out our old common-sense\nvision of the order of the universe. Quantum physics brought on the\ndematerialization of physical matter\u2014matter in the small could\nno longer be conceptualized as a Rutherfordian planetary system of\nparticle-like objects. The entities described by the mathematical\nformalism seemed to fit the picture of a collection of fluctuating\nprocesses organized into apparently stable structures by statistical\nregularities\u2014i.e., by regularities of comportment at the level\nof aggregate phenomena. During the early decades of the twentieth\ncentury process philosophers were excited by the evidence that physics\nhad turned the tables on the core refuge of substance metaphysics:\nclassical atomism. Instead of very small things (atoms)\ncombining to produce standard processes (avalanches, snowstorms)\nmodern physics seemed to suggest that very small processes (quantum\nphenomena) combine to produce standard things (ordinary macro-objects)\nas a result of an as yet not understood modus operandi that\ncould, nevertheless, be mathematically described. So-called enduring\n\u201cthings\u201d in this picture would come about through the\nemergence of stabilities in statistical fluctuations, as a stability\nwave in a surging sea of process, metaphorically speaking.\n\nContemporary quantum physics has produced a more diversified theory\nlandscape, and it is an open question whether we have moved beyond the\npoint where Whitehead\u2019s metaphysical transposition of the field\nconcept is still pertinent, or could be adjusted to interpret also one\nof the currently competing\n theories.[19]\n However, very generally speaking, there are at least four basic\naspects of our current views of the quantum-physical domain that seem\nto favor a process metaphysics, whether Whiteheadian or\nnon-Whiteheadian. First, as the so-called \u2018problem of identical\nparticles\u2019 indicates, in the microphysical domain individuation\nand countability fall asunder, which calls for an ontology of\n\u2018subject-less\u2019 processes that are the features by\nwhich we individuate quantum-physical entities, but occur in countable\nunits only relative to interaction context. Second, if spacetime is\nquantized and emergent, metaphysics cannot operate with basic entities\nthat are individuated in terms of their spacetime locations. Third,\nthe \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d presents a particular difficulty\nfor substance metaphysics, since the latter rests on the assumption\nthat all individuals are fully determinate independently of their\ninteraction context. In contrast, process metaphysics endorses the\nprinciple that \u2018interaction is determination.\u2019 Fourth,\nquantum entanglement (e.g., in EPR-Bohm systems) seems a clear-cut\nexample of ontic emergence that substance metaphysics cannot\naccommodate; while some systems properties (e.g., weight) can be\nconstrued as resulting directly from the causal properties of the\nelements of a collection of persistent substrata, the correlations\nthat measurements on entangled quantum entities display cannot be\ninterpreted in this fashion since the properties of the components of\nthe system do not exist independently of the measurement performed.\nThe measured correlations thus are properties of an interaction and\nnot of any substance. While working quantum physicists often are\nhesitant to attempt any conceptual explication of mathematical models\nof quantum physical processes, Carlo Rovelli is a notable exception.\nRovelli\u2019s relationist interpretation of loop quantum gravity is\ncommitted to an understanding of physical being as becoming in a\nradical sense, as a sort of change that does not presuppose a\npre-existing spacetime\n framework.[20]\n\nInterestingly, via the unlikely subject of an ontology of quantum\nphysics, new points of contact have opened up between analytical and\n(\u2018continental\u2019) interpretive process thought in Karen\nBarad\u2019s metaphysics of \u201cagential realism\u201d (Barad\n2007). Grounded in a detailed interpretation of the philosophy of\nNiels Bohr, Barad views reality as the entanglement of natural and\nsocial\u201cagencies\u201d the distinctness of which emerges in the\nspecific \u201cintra-actions\u201d produced by specific physical\nset-ups (experiments); the continuous \u201cintra-activity\u201d of\nreality, Barad argues, calls for a non-essentialist, performatist\nunderstanding of meaning and values.\n\n(ii) Self-organization: Process metaphysics traditionally has\nbeen motivated by the fact that it seems to give the best explanation\nof the phenomena of diachronic emergence, originally understood as an\nintegral feature of evolution. Since the development of scientific\ntheories of \u201cself-organization,\u201d \u201cchaos,\u201d and\n\u201ccomplexity\u201d have begun to alter our understanding of\nevolutionary change, there is a new need for a metaphysics that can\naccommodate all sorts of phenomena where dynamic organizations exert\ncausal constraints. While older, speculative, process metaphysics\nembraced the idea of purposes and creativity in nature, and allowed\nfor the explanatory category of a \u2018self-realizing\u2019 or\n\u2018self-engendering\u2019 entity (in various terminological\nguises), present-day analytical processists confine themselves to\narguing that \u201cdownward causation\u201d becomes perfectly\nintelligible once physicalism has been divorced from the assumptions\nof the substance paradigm, and especially from the principle that\ncausal powers cannot be attributed to dynamic\n organizations.[21]\n\n(iii) Embodied cognition: The turn to \u201cembodied\ncognition\u201d in cognitive science provides another strong\nmotivation for the turn to process in metaphysics. The standard model\nof cognition as the computation of symbolic representations fits well\nwith the assumptions of substance metaphysics and suggested a pleasing\nanalogy to classical atomism: mental operations effect relational\nchange of cognitive atoms. But the first rivals to the standard model,\nconnectionism and the so-called \u201cDynamic Hypothesis\u201d (Van\nGelder 2000), were constructed along largely process-ontological\nlines, replacing the classical conception of cognitions as discrete\nabstract objects that represent concrete things outside the head with\na dynamic conception of cognitions as modes of functionings of a\nneural net or of process organizations. The neural network model of\nthe mind dominates in recent cognitive science and neuroscience where\nmathematical models of \u201cpredictive processing\u201d (see the\nentry on\n connectionism).\n In parallel with the development of the connectionist model of the\nmind, proponents of \u201cinteractivism\u201d and \u201cembodied\ncognition\u201d argued that the bodily interaction of an organism\nplays a constitutive role in cognition. A key notion for the early\ndebate about the\u2018embodiment thesis\u2019 was the concept of\n\u201cstructural coupling,\u201d a phase in the contemporaneous\ndevelopment of two systems (e.g., organism and environment) where\nmutual dynamic dependencies unfold across system boundaries. During\nthe last decade researchers working in the intersection of cognitive\nscience and philosophy of mind appear to have adopted the \u201c4E\nmodel of cognition\u201d, holding that cognition is not only\nembodied, but also \u201cembedded, enacted, and extended\u201d\n(Newen et al 2018). The 4E model of cognition is explicitly committed\nto a process view but much ontological work remains to be done in\norder to distill biologically relevant process architectures from the\nstatistical formulas (e.g., \u201cMarkov blankets\u201d) that\ncharacterize neural network\n behaviors.[22]\n5. Current challenges\n\nProcess philosophers share the view that being is dynamic or that\nthere are no concrete static entities; however, as stressed throughout\nthis entry, there are also profound differences in the way process\nphilosophers work out this basic intuition in their descriptions of\nthe structure of reality and our understanding of it. Which of the\ncompeting approaches to process philosophy can count as the currently\nmost promising? If processist theories recommend themselves in terms\nof their explanatory force, as offering new solutions to old problems\n(section 3), or better conceptual resources for new tasks (section 4),\nthen surely explanatory force should also be the standard for\nevaluating processist theories. But while cross-paradigm explanatory\nadvantages in the sense of sections 3 and 4 can be gauged more\nstraightforwardly, this becomes rather more difficult at the level of\nintra-paradigm comparisons. Does the wide scope of Whitehead\u2019s\nphilosophy of organism outweigh the fact that all explanatory\ntechnical terms are dissociated from the rest of philosophical\ndiscourse? Or again, is the explanatory force of a formal axiomatic\nprocess ontology greater than a process metaphysics formulated with\nthe means of common sense terms whose meanings are carefully\ngerrymandered, or one that operates with a network of metaphors and\nrelies on the reader\u2019s hermeneutic response? Should depth and\ndetail of the ontological description matter less perhaps than the\nimpressive explanatory scope of a consistently naturalist process view\nof \u201cThe Whole Person\u201d, from microphysics to macrosociology\n(Bickhard 2022)? Here, at the intra-paradigm level, arise all the\nfar-reaching methodological questions that surround philosophical\nexplanation in general. Setting these larger questions aside, and\nfocusing just on processist work in the style of analytic philosophy,\nthe explanatory force of a processist theory may depend on how well it\naddresses the following challenges.\n\nThe first challenge is to define the notion of dynamicity itself. If\nthe individuals of a processist theory are \u2018dynamic\u2019\nrather than \u2018static,\u2019 how can we make sense of this new\ncategory feature? Some processists say that a process or dynamic\nentity is denoted by an English sentence in the progressive,\nor\u2014less closely tied to the peculiarities of English\ngrammar\u2014by sentences licensing certain inferential patterns of\naspectual meaning (see\n footnote 6).\n In both cases the definitional task is thus deferred to linguistic\ntheories of aspect; these theories, however, take the term\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 to be understood. Alternatively, one might\nreturn to Aristotle and define dynamicity as the actualization of a\npotency or capacity. Such metaphysical expenditure can be justified if\nwe need to embrace a notion of the \u2018real\u2019 as characterized\nby actuality and potentiality anyway in order to arrive at a plausible\ninterpretation of quantum physics (as argued in Eastman et al 2016 and\nEastman 2020). A third, naturalist, strategy for defining different\ntypes of dynamicity has been suggested by Terrence Deacon, who\nintroduces an ontological label (\u201chomeodynamics\u201d) for the\nprocessing that realizes the tendency of energy dissipation\ncharacterized by the second law of thermodynamics, and describes the\nemergence of two other forms of dynamicity\n(\u201cmorphodynamics\u201d and \u201cteleodynamics\u201d) in\nterms of relationships of processes constraining each others\u2019\ntendencies for thermodynamic dissipation (Deacon 2012). Since some of\nthose processual constraints are self-referential in the sense that\nthey prevent (constrain) the thermodynamic dissipation of\nprocessing-under-such-constraints\u2014a process architecture that\nMark Bickhard labeled \u201crecursive self-maintenance\u201d\n(2004)\u2014Deacon\u2019s approach to an understanding of dynamicity\nnot only picks up on metaphysical insights of articulated in Buddhism\nand Daoism (Deacon and Cashman 2016), but also resonates with the\nfourth strategy of defining dynamicity, championed in German Idealism.\nNotwithstanding profound differences in systematic embedding, Fichte,\nHegel, and Schelling exploit the semantics of self-referential\npropositions to convey a dynamic understanding of being that is\n\u2018presence without availability\u2019, i.e., a\n\u2018presence\u2019 that can be grasped by, and as such has the\ncharacter of, a non-terminating recursion. A fifth strategy for\naddressing the task of defining dynamicity would be to reject the task\nand to directly challenge the idea of being as static. For example,\none might argue that we may be able to think coherently that\ngeometrical shapes have a sort of being that is static or unchanging,\nbut physical entities this is not possible, since it would imply that\nphysical properties can be literally possessed at an instant\nof time.\n\nThe second challenge is to state precisely how processes relate to\nspace and time. Does a commitment to a process metaphysics imply a\ncertain metaphysics of time? Do processes in some fashion constitute\nspace and time, as Whitehead postulated? Or are they occupiers of\nspatiotemporal regions like perduring entities, just not static (and\nthus, for example, providing better support for presentist accounts of\ntime than classical substances)? Upon a closer look, the distinction\nbetween \u201cperdurance\u201d and \u201cendurance\u201d (Mark\nJohnston, David Lewis), which is commonly (though perhaps not quite\ncorrectly) linked to W.E. Johnson\u2019s distinction between\noccurrents and continuants, sits badly with a process ontology. For\n\u2018activity-like\u2019 processes (e.g., snowing) somehow seem to\ntake time just as perduring entities do, yet are \u201cwholly\npresent\u201d at every time at which they exist, just like enduring\nentities or continuants. Several authors thus have pointed out that\nprocesses behave like\n continuants.[23]\n As mentioned above in section 3, this opens up a new solution path\nfor the problem of persistence, but it also calls for a clear account\nof how ongoing developmental and activity-like processes are situated\nin time and space, and how they relate to extended temporal and\nspatial regions. Moreover, if processes relate to space and time in\nways that does not allow for individuation in terms of spatiotemporal\nlocation, how else do we individuate processes? Should we take our\nbearings from scientific practices of individuating particular\nprocesses (Pemberton 2018) or can we, at least for some types of\nprocesses, lay down general conditions to determine which processes\nare parts of particular process individuals (Kaiser 2018)? For those\nwho take processes to be (abstract or concrete)\n\u201ctype-like\u201d non-particulars the question of individuation\ncan be addressed in the same way in which we individuate types,\nnamely, by classificatory taxonomies that, among other criteria,\nrelate to the way in which processes occur in space and/or time.\n [24]\n\nThe third challenge consists in describing the different ways in which\nprocesses relate to each other and especially, how they combine. Since\nprocess combinations may engender emergent processes, and also in\nother regards do not abide by the laws of Boolean algebra, neither set\ntheory not classical extensional mereology can be used as formal\nframeworks ontologically to describe and classify different types of\nprocess combinations. Moreover, since the parthood relation on\nprocesses is not transitive, at least when processes are not\nidentified with extended spatiotemporal regions, further deviations\nfrom the classical axiomatization of the parthood relations are\nnecessary to formalize a mereology on\n processes.[25]\n Alternatively, some authors suggest representing process\narchitectures with the means of mathematical category theory. Since\nsome category-theoretically defined notions of compositionality\nrestrict decomposition, proponents of \u201capplied category\ntheory\u201d argue that interdependencies of (the identity of) wholes\nand parts in process structures also can be represented within this\nformalism without incurring substance-ontological commitments. Some\nauthors recommend category theory for a formal Whiteheadian approach\nto process metaphysics (Ferrari 2021, Auxier & Herstein 2017),\nwhile others use it to formulate notions of compositionality that can\nbe applied across domains from computer science to quantum physics\n(Coecke 2017). Also systematic connections between process structures\ncan be captured category-theoretically, as Phillips and Wilson (2010 )\nshow the case of the systematicity of cognitive capacities. Besides\nmereology and category theory, some authors explore formal dialectical\ntheories in order to describe the \u201clogic\u201d of real changes\n(Brenner and Igamberdiev 2021).\n\nThe fourth challenge is more fundamental. If any of the basic\ntheoretical terms of the many process philosophies, past and present,\nare to have explanatory value at all, there must be a way to tie the\nprocess philosopher\u2019s basic intuition to ordinary experience.\nAfter all, the purpose of philosophy is to enhance human\nunderstanding, and the core concepts of philosophical explanations\nmust in some fashion be anchored in what we intuitively understand\nfrom everyday experience. In fact, some process philosophers (e.g.,\nWhitehead) argue that the traditional notion of substance (a\ntime-invariant, necessarily uniquely located particular) precisely\nlacks any experiential grounding. On the other hand, substance\nontology has been capitalizing on the fact that the canonical\nillustrations of substances, things or living things, loom large in\nour practical interactions. The explanatory force of a process\nontology thus will depend on whether it is possible to identify a\nsimilarly salient canonical illustration for whatever technical notion\nof process is postulated as basic category. Some process approaches\nuse self-experience as anchoring canonical illustration for postulated\ntechnical notions of dynamic sameness and unity, but one might worry\nthat this model is all too complex.\n6. The ultimate question: is reality directed?\n\nAs emphasized throughout, process philosophy is a complex and highly\ndiversified field that is difficult to describe in more than general\nand disjunctive terms. In conclusion this section will highlight a\ntopic on which contemporary process philosophers are fundamentally\ndivided, to the extent that one group believes that the entire issue\nis ill-conceived.\n\nAs Rescher (1996, ch. 5) points out, processists fall into two\nprincipal camps. On the one side is the teleological (and often\ntheological) wing that sees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter\nof teleological directedness towards a positive destination. On the\nother side is the naturalistic (and generally secularist) wing that\nsees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter of an inner dynamicity\nwithout any directness or at least without any directedness towards a\nspecifiable destination. Both agree in according a central role to\ninherent dynamicity in nature. But the one (naturalistic) wing sees\nthis in terms of randomness that leads in arbitrary ways away from the\nsettled formulations of an established past, while the other\n(teleological) wing sees this in terms of a goal-directed\npurposiveness preestablished by some value-geared directive force.\n\nThe division between secular and theological process philosophy has\nits roots in the early phase of contemporary process thought in late\n19th and the first half of the 20th century, and centers on two views\nof evolutions. For secular, atheological processists evolution\ntypifies the creative workings of a self-sustaining nature that\nfulfills the vision of a certain positivist program, dispensing\naltogether with a God function to explain any of the events in or\nappertaining to the\n universe.[26]\n For theological processists like Teilhard de Chardin, however,\nevolution exhibits God\u2019s handwriting in the book of nature.\n\nPresent-day processists, who in the main no longer take Darwinian\nevolution as a concept or phenomenon that demands a commitment for or\nagainst theism, are wont to point to possible areas of agreement (see\nRescher ibid.). First, present-day processists point out that both\nsecular and theological protagonists of process thought can see\nevolution not only as a crucial instrument for understanding the role\nof intelligence in the world\u2019s scheme of things but also as a\nkey aspect of the world\u2019s natural development. In addition, both\nsecular and theological processists can agree that the evolutionary\nprocess provides process philosophy with one of its main models for\nhow large scale collective processes can inhere in and result from the\noperation of numerous small-scale individual processes, thus\naccounting for innovation and creativity also on a macro-level scale.\nSecond, present-day processists draw attention to the fact that early\nprocess thinkers were divided in their assessment of the phenomenon of\nevolution, since they failed to draw a division within the phenomenon\nof evolution itself. Undoubtedly, human intelligence is based on\nteleologically blind natural selection operating with random mutations\nto produce the neurophysiological capacities of the human brain.\nCultural evolution, on the other hand, does not share these features\nand could well appear as in some sense directed. For example, one\nmight argue that cultural evolution is generally Teilhardian, in that\nit is governed by a rationality-geared selection among purposefully\ndevised mutational variations. Cognitive evolution involves both\nbiological and cultural components, superimposing non-random rational\ndecision-making on biological selection. Our cognitive capacities and\nfaculties are part of the natural endowment we owe to biological\nevolution. But our cognitive methods, procedures, standards, and\ntechniques are socio-culturally developed resources that evolve\nthrough rationality-geared decision making in the process of cultural\ntransmission through successive generations. Our cognitive hardware\n(mechanisms and capacities) develops through Darwinian natural\nselection, but our cognitive software (the methods and procedures by\nwhich we transact our cognitive business) develops in a Teilhardian\nprocess of rationality-geared decision-making that involves purposeful\nintelligence-guided variation and selection. In the eyes of\npresent-day processists\u2014at least those that no longer pursue\nspeculative process thought\u2014it is for scientific research to\ndecide whether, and to what extent, the relationship between\nbiological and cognitive evolution can be understood on the analogy\nthat \u2018biology produces the instrument and culture writes the\nmusic,\u2019 with the instrument constraining the playable music, and\nnot vice versa (cf. Rescher 1996 ch. 5 and Rescher 2006 ch.\n10).\n\nThere is a middle ground between strict theological teleology on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, the naturalistic view that there is\nno final end that all processes are ultimately directed towards.\nAccording to this third alternative, a \u2018soft\u2019 version of\nthe teleological position, process is progress. For, so goes this line\nof reasoning, one can draw a lesson from evolutionary theory about\ncollective progress despite contingency and mortality at the scale of\nthe individual organism. In the small \u2013 i.e., item by item\n\u2013 nature\u2019s processes are self-canceling: what arises in\nthe course of time perishes in the course of time. But nevertheless,\nso the argument goes, (i) the overall course of processual change\ntends to the development of ever richer, more complex and\nsophisticated conditions of occurrence. Moreover, Darwinian\nevolutionism suggests (ii) that\n\n\n\u2026 the arrangements which do succeed in establishing and\nperpetuating themselves will as a general tendency manage to have done\nso because they represent actual improvements in one way or another.\n\u2026 Accordingly, fruitfulness in the long run compensates for\ntransiency and mortality at a smaller scale of occurrence. (Rescher\n1996: 102)\n\n\nThese two central premises for soft teleology are quite substantive,\nhowever. Premise (i) presupposes that (iii) there is a general and\ncomprehensive measure of simplicity or complexity that could be\napplied to natural and cultural processes in order to claim an overall\ntendency of development towards increased complexity; in particular,\nsuch a measure of complexity should make it possible to offset\ndecreases of complexity with respect to one parameter by increases in\ncomplexity relative to another parameter. Premise (ii) presupposes\nthat (iv) species survival can be taken as an indication of some\naspect that meaningfully can be connected to the axiology of progress.\nWhether the optimism of the soft teleological position is justified\nthus ultimately depends on the tenability of claims (iii) and\n (iv).[27]\n The fact that the premises for soft teleology have direct\nimplications for our current debate about transhumanism endows the old\nquestion of the directionality of reality with unexpected practical\nrelevance for the regulation of artificial intelligence and\nrobotics.\n7. Institutionalization\n\nProcess thought constituted a prominent sector of the active\nphilosophical scene in the USA during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Apart from the proliferation of books and articles on the\ntopic, it has achieved considerable institutionalization in the USA\nduring the years after World War II. Indications of this phenomenon\ninclude the formation of the Society for Process Studies, as\nwell as the prominence of process philosophizing within the aegis of\nthe Society for American Philosophy and the American\nMetaphysical Society. Another clear token is the journal\nProcess Studies, published by the Center for Process\nStudies in Claremont CA, and founded in 1971 by Lewis S. Ford and\nJohn B. Cobb, Jr., a publication that has become a major vehicle for\narticle-length discussions in the field. Representatives of process\nphilosophy occupy influential posts in departments of philosophy and\nof religious studies in many of American universities and colleges,\nand some half-dozen doctoral dissertations are produced annually in\nthis field. But contemporary process philosophy is not geographically\nconfined. In 2002, the publishing house Ontos in Frankfurt, Germany,\nlaunched a book series on \u201cProcess Thought\u201d; though taken\nover by DeGruyter in 2015, over 25 volumes have appeared. In Europe\nthe Center for Practical Philosophy at the Universit\u00e9\ndu Louvain, Belgium, directed by Michel Weber, is a focal point for\nresearch on, and applications of, international process philosophy.\nThe Bulgarian Academy of Science recently created a Center for\nProcess Studies for philosophers and computer scientists. The\nGerman Whitehead Society regularly organizes conferences and\nsummer schools on both Whiteheadian and non-Whiteheadian process\nthought. The International Process Network, recently launched\nby Mark Dibben at the University of Tasmania, Australia, is a new web\ncommunity of international process philosophers of all philosophical\nproveniences East and West. Even though process philosophy is not\ninstitutionalized as such everywhere in the global field of\nphilosophy, it is a research paradigm that currently is in use all\naround the world.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aameri, B., 2016, <em>Reasoning About Change in Domain-Specific\nProcess Ontologies</em>, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of\nToronto.", "Auxier, R., Herstein, G., 2017. <em>The Quantum of Explanation:\nWhitehead\u2019s Radical Empiricism</em>.
