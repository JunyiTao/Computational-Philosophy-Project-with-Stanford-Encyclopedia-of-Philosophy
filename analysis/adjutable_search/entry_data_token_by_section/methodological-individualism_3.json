    "main_text": "The Rational Choice Revival\n4. The Rational Choice Revival\n\n\nFor both Hayek and Popper, the primary motivation for respecting the\nprecepts of methodological individualism was to avoid \u201cgrand\ntheory\u201d in the style of Auguste Comte, G.W.F. Hegel and Karl\nMarx. Yet the motivation for avoiding this sort of grand theory was\nnot so much that it promoted bad theory, but that it promoted habits\nof mind, such as \u201ccollectivism,\u201d\n\u201crationalism,\u201d or \u201chistoricism,\u201d that were\nthought to be conducive to totalitarianism. Thus the sins of\n\u201ccollectivism,\u201d and \u201ccollectivist\u201d thought\npatterns, for both Hayek and Popper, were primarily political. Yet as\ntime wore on, and the dangers of creeping totalitarianism in Western\nsocieties became increasingly remote, the fear of collectivism that\nunderlay the debates over methodological individualism became\nincreasingly attenuated.\n\n\nThus the concern over methodological individualism began to fade away,\nand might have disappeared completely had it not been for the sudden\nexplosion of interest in game theory (or \u201crational choice\ntheory\u201d) among social scientists in the 1980s. The reason for\nthis can be summed up in two words (and an article): the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma. Social scientists had always been aware that individuals in\ngroups are capable of getting stuck in patterns of collectively\nself-defeating behavior. Paul Samuelson\u2019s \u201cThe Pure Theory of\nPublic Expenditure\u201d (1954), Garrett Hardin\u2019s \u201cThe Tragedy\nof the Commons,\u201d (1968), and Mancur Olson\u2019s The Logic of\nCollective Action (1965), had all provided very clear examples of\ncases where the mere existence of a common interest among individuals\nnevertheless failed to provide them with an incentive to perform the\nactions necessary to realize that interest. What the story of the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma \u2013 and more importantly, the accompanying game\nmatrix \u2013 provided was a simple yet powerful model that could be\nused to represent the structure of all these interactions (see\nR. Hardin 1982).\n\n\nThis in turn gave renewed impetus to methodological individualism,\nbecause it allowed theorists to diagnose with unparalleled precision\nthe errors that social theorists could be (and often were) led into if\nthey ignored the action-theoretic level of analysis. Methodological\nindividualism became important, not as a way of avoiding the political\nthought-crime of \u201ccollectivism,\u201d but rather as a way of\navoiding demonstrably fallacious inferences about the dynamics of\ncollective action. For example, the traditional \u201cinterest\ngroup\u201d theory of democratic politics generally presupposes that\ngroups who share a common interest also have an incentive to promote\nthat interest, by lobbying politicians, funding research, and so\non. Olson\u2019s major contribution was to have driven home the point that\nthe existence of such a common interest just as often generates a\nfree-rider incentive. Individuals would benefit from acting to promote\nthat interest, but they would benefit even more by sitting\nback while the other members of the group acted to promote it. As a\nresult, no one may act to promote it.  However, Olson confined this\nobservation to large groups. The prisoner\u2019s dilemma, on the other\nhand, demonstrated the ubiquity of this incentive structure.\n\n\nJon Elster\u2019s contribution to the history of methodological\nindividualism must be understood against this background. He presents\nthe doctrine as part of a friendly yet trenchant critique of the use\nof functionalist explanations in the Marxist tradition; particularly\nthose that seek to explain events as ones that \u201cserve the\ninterests of capital.\u201d The problem with these explanations,\nElster argues, is that they \u201cpostulate a purpose without a\npurposive actor\u201d (1982, 452), and therefore (he claims)\nentail a commitment to some form of objective teleology. In itself,\nthere is very little new in this criticism. As G.A. Cohen argued, in\nhis response to Elster, there is no reason that the Marxian\nfunctionalist cannot provide \u201celaborations\u201d (Cohen 1982,\n131) of these explanations, ones that specify how the benefit\nproduced evokes the phenomenon, without reference to any objective\nteleology. This could be done either by appealing to an intentional\nmechanism at the action-theoretic level or else a Darwinian\n\u201cselection\u201d mechanism (Cohen 1982, 132).  In such cases,\nElster\u2019s critique of functional explanation becomes just another\nversion of Watkins\u2019s demand for \u201crock-bottom\u201d rather than\n\u201chalf-way\u201d explanations.\n\n\nThus what made Elster\u2019s attack so forceful was not the accusation of\nobjective teleology in Marxist theory, but rather the suggestion that\nmuch of Marxian \u201cclass analysis\u201d overlooked the potential\nfor collective action problems among the various world-historical\nactors. Consider, for example, the familiar claim that capitalists\nretain a \u201creserve army of the unemployed\u201d in order to\ndepress wages. This means that individual capitalists must stop hiring\nnew workers at a point where marginal benefits still exceed the\nmarginal costs. What is their incentive for doing so? They have an\nobvious free-rider incentive to keep hiring, since the benefits\nstemming from depressed wages would largely be enjoyed by rival firms,\nwhereas the benefits of further hiring would flow to the bottom line.\nIn other words, the mere fact that it is in the \u201cinterests of\ncapital\u201d to have a reserve army of the unemployed does not mean\nthat individual capitalists have an incentive to take the steps\nnecessary to maintain such a reserve army.\n\n\nAn even more disturbing consequence of the \u201crational\nchoice\u201d perspective is the observation that the working class\nfaces a major collective action problem when it comes to carrying out\nthe socialist revolution (Elster 1982, 467). Fomenting revolution can\nbe dangerous business, and so absent some other incentive (such as\nclass solidarity), even workers who were convinced that a communist\neconomic order would offer them a superior quality of life might still\nfail to show up at the barricades. Yet these possibilities were\nlargely overlooked, Elster suggests, because the failure to respect the\nprecepts of methodological individualism, along with the promiscuous\nuse of functional explanation, had led generations of Marxian\ntheorists simply to ignore the actual incentives that individuals face\nin concrete social interactions.\n \n\nBeyond the critique of functional explanations, Elster does not\nadvance any original argument in support of methodological\nindividualism. He does, however, return to the earlier Weberian\nformulation of the position, with its emphasis on intentional action\n(Elster 1982, 463): \u201cThe elementary unit of social life is the\nindividual human action,\u201d he argues. \u201cTo explain social\ninstitutions and social change is to show how they arise as the result\nof the actions and interaction of individuals. This view, often\nreferred to as methodological individualism, is in my view trivially\ntrue\u201d (Elster, 1989, 13). Here one must assume that when he says\n\u201ctrivially true,\u201d he is using the term in the vernacular\nsense of \u201cplatitudinous\u201d rather than the philosophical\nsense of \u201ctautologous,\u201d since he goes on to derive a\nnumber of very substantive doctrines from his commitment to\nmethodological individualism. For example, he goes on to claim at\nvarious points that methodological individualism commits him to\npsychologistic reductionism with respect to sociology (although he\ndoes not offer an argument for this claim).\n \n\nElster does not draw as sharp a distinction as he might have\nbetween the commitment to methodological individualism and the\ncommitment to rational choice theory. Indeed, he also assumes that the\nlatter flows directly from the former. The version of rational choice\ntheory that Elster endorses, however, is one that is based upon a\ntraditional instrumental (or homo economicus) conception of\nrationality, according to which \u201cactions are valued and chosen\nnot for themselves, but as more or less efficient means to the a\nfurther end\u201d (Elster 1989, 22). He claims that this conception\nof rationality is implied by the fact that decision theorists are able\nto represent the rational actions of any agent possessing a\nwell-behaved preference ordering as the maximization of a utility\nfunction. Yet whether utility-maximization implies instrumentalism\ndepends upon the version of expected utility theory that one\nsubscribes to. So-called \u201cworld Bayesian\u201d versions of\ndecision theory, such as Richard Jeffrey\u2019s (1983) do not impose an\ninstrumental conception of rationality, since they permit agents to\nhave preferences over their own actions. Thus Elster\u2019s move from\nmethodological individualism to the instrumental conception of\nrationality is based upon a non sequitur.\n\n\nNevertheless, as a result of Elster\u2019s arguments, methodological\nindividualism became synonymous in many quarters with the commitment\nto rational choice theory. Such an equation generally fails to\ndistinguish what were for Weber two distinct methodological issues:\nthe commitment to providing explanations at an action-theoretic level,\nand the specific model of rational action that one proposes to use at\nthat level (i.e., the ideal type). There are multiple\npermutations. For instance, there is no reason that one cannot be a\nmethodological individualist while choosing to employ Habermas\u2019s\ntheory of communicative action rather than rational choice theory as\nthe model of rational action. In fact, this would make greater sense,\nsince game theory, strictly construed, has never purported to offer a\ngeneral theory of rational action. The Nash solution concept, which\nprovides the standard definition of a game-theoretic equilibrium,\nspecifically excluded all forms of communication between the players\n(and the solution does not work in cases where communication does\nintrude [Heath 2001]). Thus much of the furor over rational choice\nimperialism has been based upon a failure to appreciate the\nlimitations of that model (in many cases both by its defenders and its\ncritics).\n",
