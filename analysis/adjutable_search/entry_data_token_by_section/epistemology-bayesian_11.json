Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence\n\nA coherence norm states how one\u2019s opinions ought to fit together\non pain of incoherence. Most Bayesians agree that the correct\ncoherence norms include at least Probabilism, but they disagree over\nwhich version of Probabilism is right. There is also the question of\nwhether there are correct coherence norms that go beyond Probabilism\nand, if so, what they are. Those issues were only sketched in the\ntutorial\n section 1.4.\n They will be detailed in this section.\n\nTo argue that a certain norm is not just correct but ought to be\nfollowed on pain of incoherence, Bayesians traditionally\nproceed by way of a Dutch Book argument (as presented in the tutorial\n section 1.6).\n For the susceptibility to a Dutch Book is traditionally taken by\nBayesians to imply one\u2019s personal incoherence. So, as you will\nsee below, the norms discussed in this section have all been defended\nwith one or another type of Dutch Book argument, although it is\ndebatable whether some types are more plausible than others.\n\n",
