    "main_text": "The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow?\n6. The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow?\n\nWe have suggested that the most promising arguments for propositions\nare the metalinguistic arguments and the Metaphysics 101 argument. The\nformer arguments are plainly theoretical: they appeal to the\nexplanatory power of semantical theories invoking propositions. To\nresist them, there is no need to explain away their intuitive appeal,\nbecause they do not and are not intended to have intuitive appeal.\nThis is not true of the Metaphysics 101 argument. It is thoroughly\nintuitive, and so resisting the argument requires giving a story about\nhow and why intuition goes wrong. In this section, we will consider\none general strategy for doing this.\n\nThe Metaphysics 101 argument can seem Janus-faced: its premises seem\nutterly shallow, and yet its conclusion seems to resolve a deep\nontological debate. One is apt to think, \u201cSure, what I believe\nis different from my believing it. And so we can distinguish the\ncontent of a belief from the attitude of belief. These contents are\npropositions. Fine, but now it seems there must be a domain of\nentities here, whose nature remains to be investigated. How could that\nbe?\u201d One might suspect some sort of equivocation or ambiguity is\nat work, some oscillation between a shallow and a deep\ninterpretation.\n",
