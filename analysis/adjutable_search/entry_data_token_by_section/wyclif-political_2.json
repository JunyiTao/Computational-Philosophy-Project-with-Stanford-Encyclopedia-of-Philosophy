    "main_text": "Dominium in Political Thought Before Wyclif || Giles of Rome\n2.2 Giles of Rome\n\n\nDuring the conflict between Philip IV of France and Pope Boniface VIII\nin 1301, Giles of Rome wrote De Ecclesiastica Potestate,\nestablishing the absolute secular superiority of the papacy. Giles'\nmaster Boniface VIII was responsible for the two famous Bulls,\nClericos laicos (1296), which forbade clergy to give up\nproperty without papal approval, and Unam sanctam (1302),\nwhich declared that secular power is in the service of, and subject\nto, papal authority. De Ecclesiastica Potestate is an\narticulation of the concept of power underlying these two Bulls and\narising from one of the two interpretations of Augustine described\nabove. In it, Giles describes all power \u201cspiritual and secular\u201d as\nrooted in the papacy, likening its structure to a papal river from\nwhich smaller, secular streams branch out. The source of this river,\nhe continues, is the sea, which is God: \u201cGod is a kind of font and a\nkind of sea of force and power, from which sea all forces and all\npowers are derived like\n streams.\u201d[3]\n  Not only is secular power reliant on papal authority; all property\nownership, insofar as it is just, is similarly dependent on an\necclesiastical foundation. The key element in just secular power and\nproperty ownership, he continues, is grace: without God's will\ndirectly moving in creation through the sacraments of the Church,\npower and ownership are empty claims, devoid of justice. Although\nGiles did not explicitly call the combination of ownership and\ntemporal power dominium, his uniting the two in a consistent,\nAugustinian fashion was sufficient for the next generation of\nAugustinian theorists.\n",
