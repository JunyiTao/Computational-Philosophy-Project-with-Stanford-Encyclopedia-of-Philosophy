    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions about Genetics || What Do Genes Do?\n2.3 What Do Genes Do?\n\nAt a celebration of the Human Genome Project completion in 2003 (see\n section 1.5 above),\n genome enthusiasts promised that the major genes for heart disease,\nmental health disorders, and diabetes would all be discovered shortly,\nthat treatments would soon follow, and that genetic cures would be\navailable by 2020. To call those claims \u201chype\u201d would be an\nunderstatement. Genome-wide association studies following the Human\nGenome Project revealed that the most common human diseases were\nimpacted by many, many places in the genome, each of which made a very\nsmall contribution to the risk of having or not having the ailment.\nThat, in turn, meant that there were no simple targets for genetic\ninterventions because there were simply too many genetic points and\npathways from those points. Most strikingly, even the traits for which\nsingle genes were discovered\u2014cystic fibrosis for\nexample\u2014remained stubbornly resilient to cures, even though\nthose genes were identified 30 years prior. Philosophical critics of\ngenetics pointed to this mismatch between genetic promises and genetic\ndeliveries to argue against misleading and harmful notions of genetic\nessentialism (Nelkin an Lindee 2004). \u201cMisleading\u201d because\nstudies about complex relationships between some portion of DNA and\nsome human trait often were simplified down to claims about\ndiscoveries of \u201cthe gene for\u201d that trait. And\n\u201charmful\u201d because the language encouraged continued\ninvestment of public resources in gene-hunting research, when it was\npossible that society would gain more from focusing biomedical\nresearch agendas elsewhere (entries:\n feminist philosophy of biology;\n the human genome project;\n theories of biological development;\n philosophy of medicine;\n sociobiology;\n philosophy of science in Latin America;\n philosophy of biomedicine).\n\nOne source of confusion, according to the critics, were the metaphors\nthat got embedded in molecular genetics in the mid-twentieth century.\nComputing and architectural metaphors suggesting that the genome was a\n\u201cprogram\u201d or \u201cblueprint\u201d for development\nconveyed misleading ideas about how cells operated (Kay 2000).\nInformational metaphors may capture some features of biology, but the\nerror was in thinking that only DNA carried that biological\ninformation (Griffiths 2001; Jablonka 2002; entries:\n biological information;\n innateness and language;\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics;\n the historical controversies surrounding innateness).\n\nAn alternative way of making sense of what genes do without the\nbaggage of metaphors is to characterize it in causal language. C.\nKenneth Waters drew on a manipulationist theory of causation that\ntreated causes as manipulable difference-makers, where Waters\u2019\ninsight was to add a distinction between \u201cpotential\ndifference-makers\u201d and \u201cactual difference-makers\u201d\n(Waters 2007). In carefully controlled genetic experiments such as\nMorgan\u2019s classic work on fruit flies (see\n section 1.1 above),\n Waters pointed out that there were many potential difference-makers\nfor a trait under investigation like eye color, but it was the actual\ngenetic difference that was responsible for the actual difference in\neye color. Waters claimed further that the spread of genetics\nthroughout the life sciences was partly attributable to this feature\nof scientists being able to manipulate phenotypes by manipulating\ngenes (entries:\n molecular genetics;\n causation and manipulability). As with the information metaphor, though, philosophical\ncritics have been willing to accept Waters\u2019 distinction between\npotential and actual difference-makers, but then challenged the idea\nthat only genes acted as actual difference-makers (Griffiths and Stotz\n2013; entry:\n developmental biology).\n\nResearch agendas for investigating the living world now commonly\nreference genes as one unit, element, or level to be considered by\nbiologists (entries:\n levels of organization in biology;\n philosophy of microbiology). The Research Domain Criteria of psychiatry lists genes\nas one unit of analysis alongside cells, circuits, and physiology\n(entry:\n philosophy of psychiatry).\n Conservation biologists attend to different targets of\nconservation\u2014genes, but also species, sub-species, populations,\nand biomes (entries:\n conservation biology;\n biodiversity). The ubiquity of these references to genes in scientific\npractices that range from understanding major depressive disorder to\nsaving the Great Barrier Reef serves as an affirmation of\nWaters\u2019 point about the power of genetics to act as a point of\nintervention in the world. At the same time, the fact that genes are\nbut one item in these lists of possible points of intervention reminds\nus that they are not unique (entry:\n inheritance systems).\n",
