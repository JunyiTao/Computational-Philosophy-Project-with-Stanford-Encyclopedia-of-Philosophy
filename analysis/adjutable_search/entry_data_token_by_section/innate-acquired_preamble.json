    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea that some characteristics of an organism are explained by its\nintrinsic nature, whilst others reflect the influence of the\nenvironment is an ancient one. It has even been argued that this\ndistinction is itself part of the evolved psychology of the human\nspecies. The distinction played an important role in the history of\nphilosophy as the locus of the dispute between Rationalism and\nEmpiricism discussed in\n another entry\n in this encyclopedia. This entry focuses on accounts of the\ninnate/acquired distinction from the mid 19th century to\nthe present. These accounts have for the most part been inspired by\nthe sciences of mind and behavior. Hence, Section 1 focuses on key\nscientific controversies about the innate/acquired distinction in the\nbehavioral sciences since Darwin. We choose this starting point\nbecause the theory of evolution is the inevitable background to any\nmodern discussion of innate behavior. Moreover, Darwin himself\npioneered an approach to the study of innate behavior that remains\ninfluential even today.\n\nHaving outlined these key scientific debates, we then turn to attempts\nby philosophers to understand those debates. Section 2 considers five\nalternative diagnoses of why nativism is the subject of so many\nscientific controversies. The first diagnosis is that scientists\nsimply fail to appreciate the legitimate differences in explanatory\nemphasis across different sciences. The second diagnosis is that\nscientists disagree about whether certain cognitive traits are\nacquired by special (as opposed to general) purpose learning\nmechanisms. The third diagnosis sees the innateness concept as a\ndisciplinary boundary marker between psychological and biological\nsciences. The fourth diagnosis claims that scientific debates are the\nresult of a deeply muddled concept which conflates various properties\nthat ought to be distinguished. The fifth diagnosis claims that\nscientific conceptions of innateness are easily conflated with a\ndeeply unscientific vernacular conception that is grounded in folk\nessentialism.\n\nAlthough philosophers disagree about which (if any) of these diagnoses\nare correct, there is almost universal agreement that our vernacular\nor \u201cfolk\u201d concept of innateness is out of step with recent\nadvances in biology and psychology. Section 3 considers several\nattempts to revise the vernacular concept of innateness to avoid some\nof its more obvious scientific pitfalls. One proposal recommends\ndefining a trait as innate insofar is it genetically specified or\nencoded. Another proposal defines innateness as developmental\ninvariance. A third defines innateness in terms of the biological\nproperty of developmental canalization. A fourth revisionist proposal\ndefines innateness as a psychological disposition that is\nenvironmentally triggered. Each of these proposals faces shortcomings\nthat are outlined in this entry and which suggest, to some, a very\ndifferent strategy for the behavioral sciences. Instead of revising\nthe concept of innateness to render it more scientifically accurate,\nanother option is to eliminate the innate/acquired distinction from\nscientific discourse. Section 3 concludes with a review of of this\neliminativist proposal.\n\nFinally, in our conclusion we reflect on how philosophy can hope to\nadvance our understanding of innateness and related concepts, and how\nthis philosophical work relates to the sciences of the mind in which\nthese concepts remain vital and contested.\n",
