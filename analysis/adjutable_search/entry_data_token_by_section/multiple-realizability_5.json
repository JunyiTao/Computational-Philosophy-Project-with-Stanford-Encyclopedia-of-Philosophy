    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || One-Way Bridge Principles in Nagel Reductions\n2.1 One-Way Bridge Principles in Nagel Reductions\n\nRobert Richardson (1979) argues that Fodor\u2019s multiple\nrealizability challenge to reductionism (see\n \u00a71.2\n above) rests on a misunderstanding of Ernest Nagel\u2019s\n\u201cclassic\u201d account of intertheoretic reduction. Although\nNagel\u2019s (1961) detailed examples of historical cases of\nintertheoretic reduction in science all involve biconditional\ncross-theory \u201cconditions of connectivity\u201d (what Fodor and\nothers called \u201cbridge laws\u201d), one-way conditional\nconnections expressing sufficient conditions at the reducing level are\nall that his \u201cprinciple of derivability\u201d requires.\nRichardson cites passages from Nagel (1961) indicating that Nagel\nhimself saw the force of this point. Multiple realizability only\nchallenges necessity (and nondisjunctive) reducing conditions, and so\nis not a challenge to a projected, distinctively Nagelian reduction of\npsychology to some physical science. However, this response seems not\nto dispose of the original argument\u2019s force against mind-brain\nidentity theory.\n",
