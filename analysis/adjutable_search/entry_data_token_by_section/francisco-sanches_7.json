Sanches\u2019 Place in the History of Philosophy\n\nRegardless of the extent of the debt Descartes owed Sanches, great or\nsmall, it is undeniable that even as a background figure in Cartesian\nstudies, Sanches holds a noteworthy place firstly in the history of\nscepticism, and secondly in the history of modern philosophy. Possibly\nthanks to Limbrick and Thomson\u2019s English edition of Quod\nnihil scitur, Sanches was at last acknowledged as a source in\nCartesian studies in Ariew, Cottingham, and Sorell\u2019s\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations: Background Source Materials\n(1998). Here, along with some new translations of selected passages\nfrom Quod nihil scitur, John Cottingham writes that \n\n\nthough Sanches, unlike Descartes, proposes no new method for the\nacquisition of knowledge, he does produce some interesting\nanticipations of the Cartesian approach, particularly when he\ndistinguishes between \u201cexternal\u201d objects of cognition and\nthe \u201cinner\u201d objects of the mind (e.g., its own inner\nawareness of its willing and thinking. (Cottingham 1998: 9) \n\n\nBut this is as much as Cottingham is willing to concede to Sanches,\nfor ultimately Sanches remains for him a man \u201ctrapped in the\ninescapable ignorance of the pre-Enlightenment world\u201d (1998: 9).\nIn some ways this has been the unfortunate fate of Sanches until very\nrecently: to be considered an interesting but insignificant\nphilosopher. This in part is due to the fact that the history of\nphilosophy used to be presented as a series of ex nihilo\nevents bearing the names of Plato, Aristotle,\n Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804),\n etc., as though one day there was nothing and then the next day there\nemerged, for example, the figure/event we know by the name of Kant.\nBut fortunately philosophy is no longer presented or taught this way.\nTherefore, if Sanches was not a major philosopher, the originality of\nhis work, for example, combining \u201cmedieval epistemological ideas\nand ancient sceptical habits of thinking\u201d (Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2000:\n243)\u2014certainly impacted the work of other philosophers of his\ntime and beyond. However, because no else would pay attention, certain\nearly twentieth century Portuguese and Spanish thinkers, often for\nnationalistic reasons, turned Sanches into the Spanish or Portuguese\n\u201cprecursor\u201d of Descartes, Bacon, Hobbes, and Kant. \n\nOne such writer was Te\u00f3filo [Teophilo] Braga (1843\u20131924),\na philologist and essayist, who was the second elected president of\nthe first Portuguese Republic (1911\u20131914). Not surprisingly,\nthen, in his 1881 essay \u201cO portuguez Sanches, precursor do\npositivismo\u201d (The Portuguese Sanches, precursor of positivism)\nBraga presented Sanches as precursor of\n Francis Bacon (1551\u20131626)\n and the nineteenth century positivism of\n Auguste Comte (1798\u20131856).\n And because Braga viewed Comte as a representative of the values of\nscience and republicanism, the \u201cPortuguese Sanches\u201d\n(supposedly \u201cborn in Braga\u201d) Sanches served as the perfect\nprecursor of the positivist ideas Braga himself embraced.\n\nIn Spain, Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo argued in his essay\n\u201cDe los or\u00edgenes del criticismo y del escepticismo y\nespecialmente de los precursores espa\u00f1oles de Kant\u201d\n(1918, On the origins of critique and scepticism and especially in the\nSpanish precursors of Kant) that given the similarity of the opening\npages of Descartes\u2019s Discourse on the Method and\nSanches\u2019 Quod nihil scitur, it was obvious that\nCartesianism was in large part the product of ideas stolen from\nSpanish philosophy (1918: 186). But nowhere in the essay does\nMen\u00e9ndez y Pelayo prove this, or bother to consider the\ndifferences between Sanches and Descartes. As to Kant\u2019s debt to\nSanches, he has little to say on this matter, except that some of\nSanches\u2019 ideas about God, eternity, and the creation of the\nworld, anticipated Kant\u2019s notion of the antinomies (1918: 195).\nFinally, the only thing that he says with some level of sobriety with\nrespect to Kant and Sanches, is that they both made manifest the idea\nthat one can believe in God without having to believe in metaphysics\nor logical demonstrations (1918: 196), and that was probably in order\nto accommodate philosophy with Spanish Catholicism.\n\nInterestingly, thirteen years earlier, in 1905, Eloy Bull\u00f3n y\nFern\u00e1ndez, wrote in Los Precursores espa\u00f1oles de\nBacon y Descartes that Sanches had anticipated Descartes, Bacon,\nand Comte (1905: 181). But here the tone is more conciliatory and\nsober, and Bull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez takes the trouble to call\nattention not only to similarities, but also to the differences\nbetween these thinkers. He recognizes, for instance, that while both\nSanchez and Descartes begin their project with a critique of\nscholasticism, and particularly, a critique of the appeal to\nauthority, their initial battle call, Sanches\u2019 dismissal of\nmetaphysics and its replacement with empiricism was not shared by\nDescartes (1905: 170); and neither was it by Bacon, despite the\nlatter\u2019s questioning of the syllogism in the Novum\nOrganum. What, according to Bull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez,\nSanches shares with Bacon is a belief in the observation of things\n(res) over the analysis of words (verba). And one\ncan certainly hear echoes of Sanches in aphorism XIII from the\nNovum Organum when Bacon writes: \n\n\nThe syllogism is not applied to the principles of the sciences, and is\nof no avail in intermediate axioms, as being very unequal to the\nsubtlety of nature. It forces assent, therefore, and not things\n[res]. (1620 [1902: 13\u201314]) \n\n\nWhere they part ways is that while Sanches did not trust the senses,\nBacon believed that one could arrive at certain truths through the\nobservation of natural phenomena, and thereby avoid \u201cthe\narrogance of dogmatism, and the despair of scepticism\u201d (1620\n[1902: 5]). Now, what Sanches had in common with Kant, says\nBull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez, is that neither one nor the other\nbelieved that the mind was capable of apprehending the things\nthemselves (1905: 179).\n\nWhat is missing from all these studies of Sanches who posit him as\nprecursor of this or that major philosopher\u2014from Braga (1881) to\nBull\u00f3n y Fern\u00e1ndez (1905), Men\u00e9ndez y Palayo\n(1918), and Fernando A. Palacios (1991: 27\u201329) to Carlos Mellizo\n(1982: 52\u201364)\u2014is a certain lack of rigor. More fruitful\nwould be to consider Sanches as a representative of modern scepticism\nwith roots going back to ancient scepticism\u2014someone whose form\nof scepticism impacted modern philosophy, even in cases where it went\nunacknowledged, as in the case of Kant. To this point, Dumont writes\nthat Kant\u2019s silence was historical in his dismissal of\nPyrrhonist and Academic scepticism; in his lack of knowledge regarding\nSextus Empiricus; and in designating Hume as the only author\nrepresentative of scepticism (1972: 73): as though Hume was not\nhimself responding to sceptics like Sextus Empiricus or Carneades. But\nas M.F. Burnyeat explains in \u201cThe Sceptic in his Place and\nTime\u201d, in Kant\u2019s silence regarding the sceptics,\nscepticism itself became \u201cthe name of something internal to the\nphilosopher\u2019s own thinking, his alter ego as it were\u201d\n(1987: 35). \n\nTwo philosophers who did acknowledge the importance of scepticism for\nphilosophy were\n G. W. Leibniz (1646\u20131716)\n and\n G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831;\n 1801 [1985]). As a matter of fact, in response to a letter by French\nmathematician, Pierre Varignon (1654\u20131722), who had asked him\nfor some clarification on what he meant by\n\u201cinfinitesimal\u201d, Leibniz reference\u2019s Sanches\u2019\nQuod nihil scitur and his challenge to Clavius with some\nadmiration. Such scepticism, he says to Varignon, is important because\nit keeps mathematics from becoming a dogmatic science (cf. de Olaso\n1987: 149\u2013150). The questions raised by sceptics like Sextus\nEmpiricus and Sanches, says Leibniz, are key for \u201cestablishing\nsound foundations for a science\u201d ([1702 [1970: 544]). Leibniz\nwrites: \n\n\nI have often thought that a reply by a geometrician to the objections\nof Sextus Empiricus and to the things which Francis Sanchez, author of\nthe book Quod nihil scitur, sent to Clavius, or to similar\ncritics, would be more useful than we can imagine. (1702 [1970: 544])\n\n\n\nThus perchance, in Leibniz\u2019s generous appreciation of the\nsceptics\u2019 challenge to dialectical and metaphysical dogmatism,\nlies the answer to what Dumont calls Kant\u2019s\n\u201csilence\u201d: that which according to the author of the\nCritique of Pure Reason did not need to be named, because it\nwas always at the heart of the philosophical enterprise.\n\nIn the Introduction to Scepticism from the Renaissance to the\nEnlightenment, the editors Richard H. Popkin and Charles B.\nSchmitt write that \u201cLittle effort seems to be made to study the\nclassical formulations, and the development of these from Sextus at\nleast to Hume and Kant\u201d (1987: 10); and while that may certainly\nbe true, even less effort has been made to include twentieth century\nphilosophers. In the introduction to Que nada se sabe,\nFernando A. Palacios states that for Sanches there was no difference\nbetween logic and rhetoric, as they both culminated in a series of\nlanguage games (1991: 24). Now, it would certainly be wrong to take\nthis analogy too far without due rigorous study, but there are moments\nin Sanches\u2019 scepticism regarding the truths of metaphysics and\nlanguage that remind one of the\n Wittgenstein\n of the Philosophical Investigations (cf. Fogelin 1981).\n\u201cSanchez\u2019s Quod nihil scitur almost reads like a\ntwentieth century text of analytic philosophy\u201d, wrote Popkin\n(1964: 41). And here, for example, such a comparison, and there are\nmany (e.g., Mikko Yrj\u00f6nsuuri\u2019s with the homunculus\nof philosophy of mind \u201cwho understands mental\nrepresentations\u201d, 2000: 239), could be a worthwhile starting\npoint. The history of scepticism is inseparable from the history of\nphilosophy, and the history runs backwards and forwards. In that\nhistory, Francisco Sanches, even as a \u201cminor\u201d figure, had\nsubstantial things to say about philosophy, and we need to overcome\nthe traditional assessments of Sanches, such as J. Iriarte\u2019s\n(1940: 449\u2013451) or Frederick Copleston\u2019s for whom Sanches\n\u201cwas prevented by his sceptical attitude from making positive\nand constructive suggestions\u201d (1953: 230). Quite to the\ncontrary, I agree with Agostino Lupoli (2009) that Sanches\u2019\nscepticism was constructive and mitigated, and was intended as a form\nof intellectual therapy. Hence the \u201cQuid?\u201d with which he\nended his writings, and with which all philosophy worthy of the name\nbegins.\n",
