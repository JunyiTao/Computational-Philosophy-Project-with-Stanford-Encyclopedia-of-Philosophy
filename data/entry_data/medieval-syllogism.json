    "preamble": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the syllogism played an important role in the\nWestern and Near Eastern intellectual traditions for more than two\nthousand years, but it was during the Middle Ages that it became the\ndominant model of correct argumentation. \n\nHistorically, medieval logic is divided into the old logic (logica\nvetus), the tradition stretching from Boethius (c. 480\u2013525)\nuntil Abelard (1079\u20131142), and the new logic (logica\nnova), from the late twelfth century until the Renaissance. The\ndivision reflects the availability of ancient logical texts. Before\nAbelard, medieval logicians were only familiar with Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation and Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge or Introduction to the Categories and not\nthe Prior Analytics, where Aristotle develops the theory of\nthe syllogism \u2014 though they did know something of his theory\nthrough secondary sources. Once the Prior Analytics\nreappeared in the West in the middle of the twelfth century,\ncommentaries on it began appearing in the late twelfth and early\nthirteenth centuries.\n\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the syllogism for assertoric (non-modal)\nsentences was a remarkable achievement and virtually complete in the\nPrior Analytics. To quote Kant, it was \u201ca closed and\ncompleted body of doctrine.\u201d Medieval logicians could not add\nmuch to it, though small changes were sometimes made and it was\nsystematized in different ways. It was not until the mid-fourteenth\ncentury, when John Buridan reworked logic in general and placed the\ntheory of the syllogism in the context of the more comprehensive logic\nof consequence, that people\u2019s understanding of syllogistic logic began\nto change.\n\nThe theory of the modal syllogism, however, was incomplete in the\nPrior Analytics, and in the hands of medieval logicians it\nsaw a remarkable development. The first commentators tried to save\nAristotle\u2019s original theory and in the course of doing so produced\nsome interesting logical theories, though in the end they were unable\nto make the system work. The next generation of logicians simply\nabandoned the idea of saving Aristotle and instead introduced new\ndistinctions and developed a completely new theory that subsumed the\nlogic of syllogisms.\n\nThe theory of the syllogisms developed independently in the Arabic\ntradition. Although there was some influence on the Latin tradition\nthrough Averroes, the dominant influence was Avicenna, who made\nseveral changes to Aristotle\u2019s theory and eventually became the sole\nauthority.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Aristotle\u2019s Theory\n\nIn the Prior Analytics, Aristotle presents the first system\nof logic, the theory of the syllogism (see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic\n and ch. 1 of Lagerlund 2000 for further details). A syllogism is a\ndeduction consisting of three sentences: two premises and a\nconclusion. Syllogistic sentences are categorical sentences involving\na subject and a predicate connected by a copula (verb). These are in\nturn divided into four different classes: universal affirmative (a),\nparticular affirmative (i), universal negative (e) and particular\nnegative (o), written by Aristotle as follows: \n\n\na\n\u2013\nA belongs to all B (AaB) \n\ni\n\u2013\nA belongs to some B (AiB) \n\ne\n\u2013\nA does not belong to any B (AeB) \n\no\n\u2013\nA does not belong to some B (AoB) \n\n\nThe subject and predicate in the categorical sentences used in a\nsyllogism are called terms (horoi) by Aristotle. There are\nthree terms in a syllogism: a major, a minor, and a middle term. The\nmajor and the minor are called the extremes (akra), i.e., the\nmajor extreme (meizon akron) and the minor extreme\n(elatton akron), and they form the predicate and the subject\nof the conclusion. The middle (meson) term is what joins the\ntwo premises. These three terms can be combined in different ways to\nform three figures (skhemata), which Aristotle presents in\nthe Prior Analytics (A is the major, B the middle, and C the\nminor term):\n\n\n\nI.\nA \u2013 B\nB \u2013 C\nA \u2013 C\n\n\n\nII.\nB \u2013 A\nB \u2013 C\nA \u2013 C\n\n\n\nIII.\nA \u2013 B\nC \u2013 B\nA \u2013 C\n\n\n\n\nWhen the four categorical sentences are placed into these three\nfigures, Aristotle ends up with the following 14 valid moods (in\nparentheses are the medieval mnemonic names for the valid moods; see\nSpade 2002, pp. 29\u201333, and Lagerlund 2008, for the significance\nof these names):\n\nFirst figure: AaB, BaC, therefore, AaC (Barbara); AeB, BaC, therefore,\nAeC (Celarent); AaB, BiC, therefore, AiC (Darii); AeB, BiC, therefore,\nAoC (Ferio).\n\nSecond figure: BaA, BeC, therefore, AeC (Camestres); BeA, BaC,\ntherefore, AeC (Cesare); BeA, BiC, therefore, AoC (Festino); BaA, BoC,\ntherefore, AoC (Baroco).\n\nThird figure: AaB, CaB, therefore, AiC (Darapti); AeB, CaB, therefore,\nAoC (Felapton); AiB, CaB, therefore, AiC (Disamis); AaB, CiB,\ntherefore, AiC (Datisi); AoB, CaB, therefore, AoC (Bocardo); AeB, CiB,\ntherefore, AoC (Ferison).\n\nA fourth figure was discussed in ancient times as well as during the\nMiddle Ages. In Aristotelian syllogistic, it has the following\nform:\n\nIV.\nB \u2013 A\nC \u2013 B\nA \u2013 C\n\n\nBy taking this figure into account we can derive additional valid\nmoods, all of which are mentioned by Aristotle in the Prior\nAnalytics (see, e.g., An. Pr. I.7, 29a19\u201329). The\nfourth figure moods are the following:\n\nFourth figure: BaA, CaB, therefore, AiC (Bramantip); BaA, CeB,\ntherefore, AeC (Camenes); BiA, CaB, therefore, AiC (Dimaris); BeA,\nCaB, therefore, AoC (Fesapo); BeA, CiB, therefore, AoC (Fresison).\n\n\nIf we perform a simple calculation based on the four categorical\nsentences and the four figures, we find that there are 256 possible\ncombinations of sentences. Of these, 24 have traditionally been\nthought to yield valid deductions. To the 19 already mentioned we must\nadd two subalternate moods in the first figure (Barbari and Celaront),\ntwo subalternate moods in the second figure (Camestrop and Cesaro),\nand one subalternate mood in the fourth figure (Camenop).\n\nThe difference between the first figure and the other three figures is\nthat the syllogisms in the first figure are complete, meaning that\nthey are immediately evident and do not require proof. This\ndistinction is important in Aristotle\u2019s theory, since it gives the\nfirst figure an axiomatic character, so that the proofs of the\nincomplete syllogisms in the other three figures are arrived at\nprimarily through reduction to the complete syllogisms.\n\nThe reductions of the incomplete syllogisms were made by Aristotle\nthrough conversion rules. He states the following conversion rules in\nthe Prior Analytics (I.2, 25a1\u201326):\n\n(1:1)\nAaB \\(\\supset\\) BiA,\n(1:2)\nAiB \\(\\equiv\\) BiA,\n(1:3)\nAeB \\(\\equiv\\) BeA.\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, (1:1) was called an accidental (per\naccidens) conversion and (1:2) and (1:3) simple\n(simpliciter) conversions. Particular negative sentences do\nnot convert, according to Aristotle.\n\nNot all incomplete syllogisms were reduced to complete syllogisms;\nAristotle also gave other arguments for them. He used two methods to\nprove the incomplete syllogisms: reductio ad impossibile and\nekthesis. Thus, he proves Baroco by impossibility, from the\nassumption that the premises are true and the conclusion false\n(An. Pr. I.5, 27a36-b1):\n\nBaA Premise\nBoC Premise\nAaC Assumed as the negation of the conclusion\nBaC From (i) and (iii) by Barbara\n\\(\\bot\\) From (ii) and (iv)\nAoC From (iii) and (v)\n\n\nMedieval logicians used this method as well, following Aristotle.\n\nThe ekthesis proof is more complicated and was not commonly\nused by medieval logicians, who preferred proofs through expository\nsyllogisms, a simplification and refinement of the ekthesis.\nAristotle\u2019s method can be expressed in terms of the following rules\n(Patzig 1968 and Smith 1982):\n\n(1:4)\nAiB, therefore, AaC, BaC (where C does not occur previously),\n(1:5)\nAoB, therefore, AeC, BaC (where C does not occur previously),\n(1:6)\nAaC, BaC, therefore, AiB,\n(1:7)\nAeC, BaC, therefore, AoB.\n\n\nBased on these rules, the ekthesis method permits\nstraightforward proofs of the third figure syllogisms. Aristotle\nproves Darapti (An. Pr. I.6, 28a22\u201326) and mentions\nthat Bocardo is provable by ekthesis (An. Pr. I.6,\n28b20\u201321). The proof of Bocardo is as follows:\n\nAoB Premise\nCaB Premise\nAeD From (i) and (1:5)\nBaD From (i) and (1:5)\nCaD From (ii), (iv) and Barbara\nAoC From (iii), (v) and (1:7)\n\n\nYet this account of the ekthesis proof is not without its\nproblems. Even in antiquity, Aristotle was accused of arguing in a\ncircle, since (1:6) and (1:7) seem to correspond to the third figure\nincomplete syllogisms Darapti and Felapton. (1:4)\u2013(1:7) also seem\nsuperfluous, and in fact Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. c. 200 AD) was\nable to show that ekthesis is really all Aristotle needed,\nsince all the valid moods can be proved with it. Aristotle also used\ncounterexamples to show that a mood is invalid.\n\nIn Chapters 3 and 8\u201322 of Book I of the Prior\nAnalytics, Aristotle extends his theory to include syllogisms\nwith modally qualified categorical sentences. An Aristotelian modal\nsyllogism is a syllogism that has at least one premise modalized,\ni.e., that in addition to the standard terms also contains the modal\nwords \u2018necessarily\u2019, \u2018possibly\u2019 or\n\u2018contingently\u2019. Aristotle\u2019s terminology is not entirely\nclear, however. He speaks only of necessity and possibility, though he\nworks with two notions of possibility. In what seems to be his\npreferred sense, used primarily in the Prior Analytics,\npossibility is defined as that which is not necessary and not\nimpossible. This sense of possibility was called contingency in the\nMiddle Ages. But there is another sense of possibility in Aristotle\u2019s\nOn Interpretation according to which possibility is\nequivalent to what is not impossible. The first concept of\npossibility, which I will henceforth call \u2018contingency\u2019,\nis used in the modal syllogistic. The second concept is not treated\nsystematically in the Prior Analytics.\n\nIf we follow this terminology we get eight modal categorical\nsentences, which we can raise to twelve if the notion of possibility\nis added. If we then perform the same calculation as before, taking\ninto account the four figures and also the non-modal propositions, we\nget either 6,912 or 16,384 possible moods. It would be a gargantuan\ntask, of course, to go through them all and see which ones are valid.\nAccordingly, Aristotle limits his discussion to those modal syllogisms\nwhose assertoric counterparts are valid, as did most medieval\nlogicians.\n\nAristotle treats modal syllogisms with (i) uniform necessity, (ii)\nuniform contingency, (iii) mixed necessity and assertoric, (iv) mixed\ncontingency and assertoric, and (v) mixed necessity and contingency\npremises. Possibility sentences are not treated as premises of modal\nsyllogisms. Sometimes, however, mixed syllogisms are only valid in\nreaching a possibility conclusion.\n\nAristotle uses the same methods to prove the incomplete modal\nsyllogisms as he uses for the assertoric syllogisms, i.e.,\nconversions, reductio ad impossibile, and ekthesis.\nIn An. Pr. I.3, 25a27\u201325b26, he accepts the following\nconversion rules for necessity, contingency, and possibility\nsentences:\n\n(1:8)\nNecessarily AaB \\(\\supset\\) Necessarily BiA,\n(1:9)\nNecessarily AiB \\(\\equiv\\) Necessarily BiA,\n(1:10)\nNecessarily AeB \\(\\equiv\\) Necessarily BeA,\n(1:11)\nContingently AaB \\(\\supset\\) Contingently BiA,\n(1:12)\nContingently AiB \\(\\equiv\\) Contingently BiA,\n(1:13)\nContingently AeB \\(\\supset\\) Contingently BoA,\n(1:14)\nContingently AoB \\(\\equiv\\) Contingently BoA,\n(1:15)\nPossibly AaB \\(\\supset\\) Possibly BiA,\n(1:16)\nPossibly AiB \\(\\equiv\\) Possibly BiA,\n(1:17)\nPossibly AeB \\(\\equiv\\) Possibly BeA.\n\n\nAristotle accepts no conversion rules for either necessity or\npossibility particular negative sentences, though he does accept two\nconversions to the opposite quality for contingency sentences (see\nAn. Pr. I.13, 32a30\u201332b2):\n\n(1:18)\nContingently AaB \\(\\equiv\\) Contingently AeB,\n(1:19)\nContingently AiB \\(\\equiv\\) Contingently AoB.\n\n\nIn the Prior Analytics Aristotle gives only vague hints about\nhow modal sentences are supposed to be interpreted. The problem is\nbest illustrated by what is often used as a test for all\ninterpretations of Aristotle, i.e., the problem of the two Barbara\nsyllogisms. They are discussed at An. Pr. I.9:\n\nIt is necessary that AaB \nBaC\nIt is necessary that AaC \n\n\nAaB \nIt is necessary that BaC\nIt is necessary that AaC \n\n\nThe problem is that Aristotle accepts the former but not the latter.\nThe question then is: Under which interpretation does the former come\nout valid but not the latter?\n\nTo solve this problem, it has been common in contemporary discussions\nto introduce the distinction between de dicto and de\nre modal sentences. I have presented the two syllogisms above\nwith a de dicto reading of the modal sentences, i.e., so that\nthe modality concerns the way the sentence is or is not true. On this\nreading, both Barbara syllogisms seem invalid. But what about the\nde re reading? The modality in this reading of the sentences\napplies to the manner in which the predicate belongs to the subject.\nThe two syllogisms will then have the following form:\n\n(A necessarily)aB\nBaC\n(A necessarily)aC\n\n\nAaB\n(B necessarily)aC\n(A necessarily)aC\n\n\nIt is equally obvious in these cases that the first syllogism is valid\nwhereas the latter is not, since the latter involves five different\nterms. This suggests that Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic should be\ngiven a de re interpretation (Becker 1933).\n\nHowever, if this interpretation is accepted, another problem emerges,\nnamely that the conversion rules are not valid under a de re\ninterpretation, for if the de re interpretation means that\nthe predicate is modified by the mode, the conversion rules will never\nbe valid. Consider the following example:\n\n(A necessarily)aB,\n\n\nwhich should convert to:\n\n(B necessarily)iA.\n\n\n\u2018Necessarily A\u2019 has here been transformed to\n\u2018A\u2019, which is a valid move since necessity implies\nactuality, but \u2018B\u2019 has been transformed to\n\u2018necessarily B\u2019, which is an invalid move. The same can be\nsaid for all the modal conversion rules under a de re\ninterpretation. If, on the other hand, the de dicto reading\nis maintained, it is easily seen that they are valid in view of the\nvalidity of the non-modal conversion rules.\n\nHowever, Aristotle probably did have something like a de re\nreading of the categorical sentences in mind, as many scholars have\ncome to realize and as most medievals who read him thought. But if the\nconversion rules must be given a de dicto interpretation and\nthe different syllogisms a de re interpretation, the whole\nsystem seems to collapse. This problem makes a consistent\nreconstruction of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic using modern modal\nlogic very difficult. (See Becker 1933, Lukasiewicz 1957, Rescher\n1974, van Rijen 1989, Patterson 1995, Thom 1996, Nortmann 1996 and\nMalink 2013 for such attempts, and see Hintikka 1973 and Lagerlund\n2000 for critical reflections on these attempts.)\n2. Boethius\n\nThe medieval tradition of logic is generally thought to have begun\nwith Boethius (c. 475\u2013526), who ambitiously tried to preserve\nphilosophical learning from the declining culture of late\nantiquity. In fact, however, he was only able to save parts of ancient\nlogic, primarily Aristotelian logic (see Lee 1984 for a discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic in late ancient thought). He wrote\nextensively on the theory of the syllogism, producing a Latin\ntranslation of the Prior Analytics, though it was not used\nvery much before the twelfth century (see Aristotle, Analytica\nPriora, and the introduction by Minio-Paluello). He also wrote\ntwo textbooks on the categorical syllogism: On the Categorical\nSyllogism (De syllogismo categorico) and\nIntroduction to Categorical Syllogisms (Introductio ad\nsyllogismos categoricos) (for the texts, see Migne 1847 and\nThomsen Th\u00f6rnqvist 2008). In addition, he produced an interesting\nbook called On Hypothetical Syllogisms (De hypotheticis\nsyllogismis), which will be touched on in the discussion below\n(see Boethius [Obertello 1969] for the text). \n\nBoethius made no substantial contribution to the theory of the\nsyllogism, though he was an important transmitter of the theory to\nlater logicians and his works offer a clear presentation of the\nAristotelian account. But that presentation differs from Aristotle\u2019s\nin one important respect. In Boethius, the categorical sentences are\nconstructed using \u2018is\u2019 (\u2019est\u2019) and\nnot \u2018belongs\u2019, as in Aristotle. The four sentences thus\nbecome:\n\n\na\n\u2013\nEvery B is A \n\ni\n\u2013\nSome B is A \n\ne\n\u2013\nNo B is A \n\no\n\u2013\nSome B is not A \n\n\nPut in this way, it is more obvious that they are subject predicate\nsentences, and moreover, that the syllogisms are deductions rather\nthan conditional sentences. As a result, the four figures look\ndifferent:\n\n\n\nI.\nB \u2013 A\nC \u2013 B\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nII.\nA \u2013 B\nC \u2013 B\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIII.\nB \u2013 A\nB \u2013 C\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIV.\nA \u2013 B\nB \u2013 C\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIn systematic terms, Boethius\u2019 change makes no difference and all\nmedieval logicians writing after him adopted it, even though it makes\nthe first figure syllogisms less evident. According to Aristotle, the\nfirst syllogism of the first figure (Barbara) should read: \u2018A\nbelongs to all B, B belongs to all C; therefore A belongs to all\nC\u2019. This is obviously valid by the transitivity of inclusion.\nBut if we line up the same syllogism using Boethian formulation we\nget: \u2018Every B is A, Every C is B; therefore Every C is A\u2019.\nThis is not at all as obvious and we have to switch the places of the\npremises to get the same transitivity characteristic: \u2018Every C\nis B, Every B is A; therefore Every C is A\u2019. Beyond this small\nbut significant change, Boethius does not contribute much to the\ntheory, though he is a little more interested than Aristotle in the\ndifferent kinds of conversion. His hypothetical syllogistic is, on the\nother hand, rather novel.\n\nLike most things in the history of logic, hypothetical syllogistic\nalso begins with Aristotle. In the Prior Analytics, he says\nthat every syllogism is either direct or from a hypothesis.\nTraditional syllogistic is direct and hence all syllogisms that do not\nfall into the patterns of inference defined by the three Aristotelian\nfigures, but which are nevertheless valid syllogisms, must be\nhypothetical. Aristotle\u2019s principal example is a syllogism through\nimpossibility. If we reason from a hypothesis P via a syllogism to a\nconclusion Q that is impossible, then we can conclude that not-P is\ntrue and P false (An. Pr. 41a23\u201330).\n\nIn the second century C.E., Alexander of Aphrodisias tried to develop\nthis into a theory of the hypothetical syllogism. What emerged from\nhis attempt is something quite strange and even confused, though it\nhas been studied at great length (see esp. Speca 2001 and the list of\nfurther references there). Boethius\u2019 On the Hypothetical\nSyllogisms is the only remaining early work on this topic.\n\nA hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism in which one or more premises\nare hypothetical sentences. Boethius draws the distinction between\ncategorical sentences and hypothetical sentences formally by saying\nthat a categorical sentence involves a predication whereas a\nhypothetical sentence involves a condition, i.e., it says that\nsomething is, if something else is. Typically such sentences\nare conditional sentences such as \u2018if P then Q\u2019, though\nBoethius also treats \u2018P or Q\u2019 as hypothetical, apparently\nbecause he thinks that disjunction can be translated in terms of a\nconditional sentence. Another characteristic of hypothetical sentences\nis that they are made up of categorical sentences.\n\nThe basic hypothetical sentences he gives are:\n\n(2:1)\n If it is A, then it is B\n(2:2)\n If it is not-A, then it is not-B\n(2:3)\n If it is A, then it is not-B\n(2:4)\n If it is not-A, then it is B\n\n\nHe also considers sentences involving three terms:\n\n(2:5)\n If, if it is A, then it is B, then it is C\n(2:6)\n If it is A, then if it is B, then it is C\n\n\nthough a hypothetical sentence can be even more complicated:\n\n(2:7)\nIf, if it is A, then it is B, then if it is C, then it is D.\n\n\nBoethius also thinks that hypothetical sentences can be qualified by\nmodalities such as necessity or possibility, but he never develops\nthis idea.\n\nIn trying to establish what combination of premises form valid\ninferences he proceeds like Aristotle and develops lists or tables in\nwhich he can group the valid patterns. The basic sentences (2:1)\u2013(2:4)\ncombined with a simple categorical sentence as the second premise boil\ndown to what we today know as modus ponens and modus\ntollens. This led some modern interpreters to think that Boethius\nwas developing a sentential logic as the Stoics had done (D\u00fcrr\n1951), but this idea has been rejected by more recent scholars\n(Obertello 1969, Martin 1991 and Speca 2001). Whatever Boethius\nthought he was doing, he was not trying to develop a sentential logic.\nThis becomes obvious if one considers a more complex hypothetical\nsyllogism, such as the following, which he accepts as valid:\n\nIf it is A, then if it is B, then it is C \nIf it is B, then it is not-C\nIt is not-A \n\n\nIf Boethius\u2019 logic is a sentential logic his syllogism would be\ntranslatable into the following:\n\nA \\(\\supset\\) (B \\(\\supset\\) C)\nB \\(\\supset\\) \\(\\sim\\)C\n\\(\\sim\\)A\n\n But this is not a valid deduction, since if A is assumed to be\ntrue and B false, the conclusion that follows, not-A, remains false\ndespite both premises being true.  If, on the other hand, Boethius\nmeans his reader not to take them for sentences but rather, following\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic, terms, which carry no truth-value by\nthemselves, then the inference schema can be given a valid\ninterpretation, as long as one allows for the way that Boethius\nunderstood negation and compound conditionals (see Martin 2009,\n76\u201378). If a thing is A then it must be that if it is B then it\nis C. So, if we also have that if it is B then it is not-C,\nthen it could not be A, so it must be not-A.  This example alone thus\nalready suggests that, despite some formal similarities to sentential\nlogic, Boethius is actually operating with something more akin to the\nterm logic that preceded him rather than in some newer, original,\npre-modern formulation of sentential logic. \n \nBoethius is conscious of a Stoic logical tradition in which the\nlogical forms of sentences were distinguished according to their\nlinguistic form, such that \u2018if \u2026 then\u2019 structures\nindicate conditionals and \u2018or\u2019 structures indicate\ndisjunctions, making these terms rather like operators on sentences.\nHe seems to be using these ideas to demarcate his hypothetical\nsentences, though he is still writing in an Aristotelian fashion and\ndeveloping an Aristotelian term logic (see Speca 2001 and Marenbon\n2003: 50\u201356). This mix makes his logic quite confused, and the\nconfusion was not sorted out until Abelard was able to develop a\nproper sentential logic out of Boethius\u2019 suggestions. (See\nMartin 2009 as well.)\n3. Arabic Logic and Syllogisms\n\nArabic logic begins in the middle of the eighth century. As with logic\nin the Latin tradition, it has its foundation in Ancient Greek logic,\nprimarily in Aristotelian logic and syllogistics. The Syriac\nChristians adopted a teaching tradition in logic that included\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge in addition to Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, De interpretatione and the first seven\nchapters of the Prior Analytics. This teaching tradition was\nadopted and spread through the Arab conquest. During the Abbasid\nCaliphate (750\u20131258), there was a continuous and growing interest in\nphilosophy and logic. It is this time period that is often referred to\nas the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of Arabic philosophy and logic. \n\nGradually, the whole Organon was made available in Arabic\ntranslation (the Arabic tradition was unique in treating\nAristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric and Poetics as part of logic, unlike later\ntraditions in medieval logic. The first more important Arabic logician\nwas Ish\u00e2q al-Kind\u00ee (d. 870), who wrote a short overview of the whole\nof the Organon. After him, more and more substantial works\nwere produced. Ab\u00fb Nasr Alfarabi (d. 950) made the first original\ncontributions, writing a series of commentaries on Aristotle, although\nonly his commentary on De interpretatione has survived.\nAvicenna seems to have held his work in very high esteem. By far the\nmost important logician in the Arabic tradition, however, was Ibn\nS\u00een\u00e2 (d. 1037) or Avicenna, as he was known in the Latin West. \n\nAvicenna had a different attitude to Aristotle\u2019s logic than\nlogicians before him. He did not think that Aristotle was necessarily\nright. Aristotle had a lot of intuitions about logic that do not all\nfit together into a coherent whole. They had to be worked out and\nAvicenna believed that when that happened, it would become clear that\nAristotle\u2019s logic was only a fragment of a much larger system. After\nAvicenna, the general character of Arabic logic was no longer\nAristotelian but Avicennan, which is to say that the texts drawn upon\nby most logicians were no longer Aristotle\u2019s but Avicenna\u2019s (with\nthe notable exception of Averroes, known to the Latin tradition as\n\u2018the Commentator\u2019, i.e., on Aristotle). One work of Avicenna in\nparticular became important for subsequent logicians: what is known as\nAl-Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t wa\u2019l Tanb\u00eehat in Arabic and Pointers and\nReminders in English \u2014 or Remarks and Admonitions in S.\nInati\u2019s translation (Avicenna 1984). \n\nTony Street (2002, 2004) has identified three things that make logic\nAvicennan as opposed to Aristotelian: (1) truth-conditions of absolute\n(or assertoric, i.e., non-modal) sentences are expressed in modal\nterms; (2) logical properties of so-called descriptional\n(wasfi) sentences, such as \u2018Every B is A while B\u2019, are\nstudied; and (3) syllogisms are divided into connective and\nrepetitive. If a logician adopts (1)\u2013(3), he is following Avicenna,\naccording to Street. \n\nIn Pointer Two of Path Four, Avicenna introduces distinctions between\ndifferent kinds of sentences. The first distinction is between\nabsolute and modal sentences, although absolute sentences turn out to\nbe modal as well. The basic division is one between absolute sentences\nthat are taken to be definite or indefinite with respect to time. \n\nAvicenna talks about three kinds of absolute sentences, all of which\nare explicated with reference to time. First are absolute sentences\nthat refer to a definite time, but these play no role in his\ndiscussion. The other two are the general and the special absolute\nsentences. General absolute sentences are sentences taken without\nlimitation with respect to time, which means that they have to take in\nall individuals - past, present and future. Furthermore, the copula is\ntaken to mean that the Bs are As at least sometime, as in \u2018Every\nhuman is sometimes moving\u2019. A special absolute sentence is a\nsentence with limitations with respect to time, its subject term\nreferring to individuals at a specific moment in time - although it is\nnot explicated what moment in time that is. The copula is also\nunderstood as a conjunction meaning \u2018sometimes B and sometimes not\nB\u2019, as in \u2018Everything running is sometimes walking and sometimes\nnot walking\u2019. \n\nAvicenna is quick to point out that neither general nor special\nabsolute sentences behave as expected. For example, they do not fit\nthe traditional square of opposition. \u2018Every B is A\u2019 on the\ngeneral reading does not contradict \u2018Some B is not A\u2019. Thus, he\nintroduces one other kind of absolute sentence, namely a perpetual\nabsolute sentence. In a perpetual sentence the copula is simply read\nas \u2018is always\u2019. The contradictory of a general absolute is the\nperpetual absolute, and similarly with the special absolute, although\nit will contradict a disjunction of two perpetual sentences (see\nStreet 2002 and Lagerlund 2009). \n\nThe second distinctive Avicennan thesis is the introduction of\ndescriptional (wasfi) sentences. This is again done in the\ncontext of modal syllogistics, although, such sentences do not need to\nbe modal at all and Avicenna can be seen to have introduced a logic\nfor descriptional sentences (Street 2002). The example he gives in\nPointers and Reminders is: \n\n(3:1)\nEverything walking is necessarily moving while walking\n\n\nThe addition of \u2018while walking\u2019 restricts all moving things to\nthose actually walking, which makes the sentence true. Avicenna\ndistinguishes descriptional sentences from substantial sentences. The\nexample he gives of a substantial sentence is: \n\n(3:2)\nEvery human is necessarily an animal\n\n\nThe logic for substantial sentences is different from the logic for\ndescriptional sentences. A sentences like (3:2) converts according to\nthe standard Aristotelian conversion rules, so: \n\n(3:3)\n Every human being is necessarily an animal\n\n\nconverts into: \n\n(3:4)\n Some animal is necessarily a human.\n\n\nSuch sentences are characterized by as kath\u2019 hauto (per\nse) by Aristotle in Posterior Analytics I.4 (see Lagerlund 2000,\n30\u20131). Part of what Aristotle said about modal syllogistic is valid\nfor such sentences. \n\nBut another group of sentences, such as: \n\n(3:6)\n Every literate being is necessarily a human being\n\n\nare not substantial and hence do not convert, since this converted\nsentence is false: \n\n(3:7)\n Some human being is necessarily literate.\n\n\nHowever, if these are read as descriptional sentences, then they do\nconvert: \n\n(3:8)\n Every literate being is necessarily a human being while literate\n\n\nconverts into\n\n(3:9)\n Some human being is necessarily literate while literate.\n\n\nDescriptional sentences have a syllogistic logic like substantial\nsentences and Avicenna thinks part of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic\ncan be worked out using descriptional sentences (for a comparison with\nsimilar logics found in the thirteenth-century Latin tradition, see\nLagerlund 2009). But even though Avicenna sketches a syllogistic for\ndescriptional sentences in Pointers and Reminders, he is\nmostly concerned with substantial sentences and their logic. \n\nThe third distinctive mark of Avicenna\u2019s logic is the distinction\nbetween so-called connective and repetitive syllogisms, which\ncorresponds roughly to Aristotle\u2019s distinction between categorical\nand hypothetical syllogisms.\n\nIn his history of Arabic logic, Khaled El-Rouayheb divides Arabic\nlogic after 1200 into several distinctive periods (El-Rouyaheb 2010).\nAccording to him the next period begins with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi.\nAfter Razi, the later Arabic logical tradition became disassociated\nfrom Aristotle and more narrowly focused on the predicables,\ndefinitions, propositions, and syllogisms. \n\nMost thirteenth-century logic can also be described as post-Avicennan\nin the sense that logicians in this period all took their departure\nfrom Avicenna rather than from Aristotle. In the fourteenth century\nanother transformation took place and the lengthy summaries found in\nthe earlier traditions became very rare. Instead of writing\ncommentaries on the works of Aristotle, Arabic logicians were content\nwith writing glosses. Their interest also shifted from formal logic\n(syllogisms) to semantic concerns. \n\nArabic logic began to fragment in the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies and several centers developed. El-Rouyaheb identifies\ndistinct Ottoman Turkish, Iranian, Indo-Muslim, North African, and\nChristian Arabic traditions. These developed independently of one\nother, and, according to El-Rouyaheb, it is the Ottoman Turkish\ntradition that is the most important up to the twentieth century. The\nbasic themes outlined by Avicenna remained dominant in this tradition,\nhowever. \n4. Peter Abelard\n\nPeter Abelard (1079\u20131142) was one of the first original medieval\nlogicians in the Latin West. His most thorough treatment of the theory\nof the syllogism can be found in the Dialectica, though he\noccasionally discusses it in other works as well, such as the\nLogica ingredientibus (Minio-Paluello 1958). It is only in\nthe Dialectica, however, that the theory is outlined in full.\n\n\nSince the logic of the Dialectica is based on Boethius\u2019\ncommentaries and monographs, we find in it a treatise on categorical\nsentences and categorical syllogisms (Tractatus II), and\nanother on hypothetical sentences and hypothetical syllogisms\n(Tractatus IV). But neither of these discussions is very\nextensive. Taken together, they are shorter than the discussion of\ntopical inferences, which indicates that Abelard was most interested\nin developing a logic for sentences (Green-Pedersen 1984 and Martin\n1987). His presentation of syllogistic is condensed but highly\noriginal. It reveals that he was not able to study the text of\nAristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics in any detail. He must have seen\nit, but he cannot have had access to a copy himself.\n\nAbelard gives the four standard figures and shows how the second,\nthird, and fourth (he treats the fourth figure as part of the first\nfigure with the terms in the conclusion converted) can be reduced to\nthe first in the standard ways using conversion rules and proofs\nthrough impossibility, but to clarify and simply the theory he also\npresents rules showing the validity of the different moods. In the\nfirst figure he gives these rules (I have included the terms A, B, C\nto clarify the rules, though they are not in Abelard\u2019s text):\n\n(4:1)\nIf something A is predicated of something else B universally and\na third thing C places the subject B under it universally, then the\nsame thing C also places the predicate A under it with the same mode,\nnamely universally.\n(4:2)\nIf something A is removed from something else B universally and a\nthird thing C places the subject B under it universally, then the\nfirst predicate A is removed from the second subject C\nuniversally.\n(4:3)\nIf something A is predicated of something else B universally and\nsome third thing C places the subject B under it particularly, then\nthat thing C also places the predicate A under it particularly.\n(4:4)\nIf something A is removed from something else B and a third thing\nC places the subject B under it particularly, then the first predicate\nA is removed from the second subject C particularly.\n\n\nTo these he adds two more rules for the second figure:\n\n(4:5)\nIf something B is removed from some other thing A and a third\nthing C places that predicate B under it, then the first subject A is\nremoved from the second subject C universally.\n(4:6)\nIf something B is predicated of some other thing A universally and\nthat predicate is removed from a third thing C universally, then the\n[first] subject is removed from the same [subject] C\nuniversally.\n\n\nThere are three more rules for the third figure:\n\n(4:7)\nIf two different things A and C are predicated of the same B\nuniversally, then the first A predicated of the second comes together\nparticularly.\n(4.8)\nIf something B is removed from something A universally and\nsomething third C is predicated of the same subject B universally,\nthen the first predicate A is removed from the second C\nparticularly.\n(4:9)\nIf something A is predicated of something B particularly and the\nsame B with another predicate C supposits universally, then the first\nA is predicated of the second C particularly.\n\n\nIf we allow that the conjuncts in the antecedent of these conditional\nstatements can switch places, and that a universal implies a\nparticular, these rules exhaust the 24 valid syllogisms.\n\nAbelard\u2019s rules 1 and 2 are equivalent to the rules of class inclusion\nthat later became the subject of much discussion, i.e., the so-called\ndici de omni et nullo rules. These rules are based on the\ntransitivity of class inclusion and were the standard way in which\nlater medieval logicians explained how the first figure moods are\nperfect or evident.\n\nIt was elegant of Abelard to lay out these rules that entail the valid\nmoods, but then again, the theory of the syllogism is an elegant and\nsimple system. The simplicity of his nine rules reflects the\nsimplicity of Aristotelian syllogistic, since on Aristotle\u2019s view only\nthe first two syllogisms and the rules of conversion plus the method\nof proof by impossibility and a couple of other consequences are\nneeded to demonstrate all 24 valid moods.\n\nAbelard\u2019s hypothetical syllogistic does not repeat Boethius\u2019 mistake\nof mixing a term logic like the theory of the syllogism with a\nsentential logic. Rather, Abelard\u2019s work should be seen as a very\nsophisticated development of a sentential logic. I will therefore not\ntreat it in this overview, since it belongs to the history of\nsentential logic rather than syllogistic. It seems that the medievals\nalso rather quickly stopped associating the word\n\u2018syllogism\u2019 with this theory.\n\nAbelard is also associated with the history of modal logic. He is\nfamous as the philosopher who introduced the distinction between\nde dicto and de re modal sentences. The basic\nnotions of Abelard\u2019s modal theory are to be found in the introduction\nto Chapters XII and XIII of his longer commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nDe interpretatione (ed. Minio-Paluello 1958). Abelard\nconcentrates his analysis on the logical structure of modal sentences,\nintroducing some new distinctions and concepts that were later\ncommonly used by medieval logicians.\n\nAccording to Abelard, modal terms are strictly speaking adverbs\nexpressing how something said of the subject is actualized, e.g.,\n\u2018well\u2019 or \u2018quickly\u2019 or\n\u2018necessarily\u2019. Adverbs that do not modify an actual\ninherence, e.g., \u2018possibly\u2019, are called secondary modal\nterms due to their position in a sentence. Abelard also noticed that\nin De interpretatione 12\u201313, Aristotle operates with\nnominal rather than adverbial modes, e.g. \u2018it is necessary\nthat\u2019 or \u2018it is possible that\u2019. He seems to have\nassumed that Aristotle did this because the nominal modes lead to many\nmore problems than simple adverbial modes. This is more clearly seen\nfrom the fact that sentences including nominal modes, such as\n\u2018Necesse est Socratem currere\u2019, can be understood\neither adverbially, \u2018Socrates runs necessarily\u2019, or, as\nsuggested by the grammar, \u2018That Socrates runs is\nnecessary\u2019. He calls these two alternatives de re\nnecessity sentences and de sensu (or de dicto)\nnecessity sentences, respectively. Abelard seems to be the first to\nemploy this terminology. A de re modal sentence expresses the\nmode through which the predicate belongs to the subject. The mode is,\ntherefore, associated with a thing, whereas the mode in the de\ndicto case (as he also calls it) is said of what is expressed by\na non-modal sentence.\n\nAbelard also referred to this distinction as the distinction between\npersonal and impersonal readings of a modal sentence, the de\nre sense corresponding to the personal reading and the de\ndicto sense to the impersonal reading because when the expression\n\u2018necesse est\u2019 or \u2018possibile\nest\u2019 is used at the beginning of a sentence, it lacks a\npersonal subject. Abelard states that this distinction is related to\nAristotle\u2019s distinction between per divisionem and per\ncompositionem in the Sophistici Elenchi (4,\n166a23\u201331). What is new is Abelard\u2019s contention that modal\ndiscussions should proceed by distinguishing the different possible\nreadings of modal sentences, moving on to consider their quantity,\nquality, and conversion as well as their equipollence and any other\nrelations holding between them on these different readings.\nAbelard\u2019s program thus became the standard operating procedure in\nmedieval treatises on logic.\n\nAfter Abelard, equipollence and other relations between modal\nsentences were commonly presented with the help of the square of\nopposition, which Abelard mentions though it does not appear as such\nin his works. The square can be taken to refer to de dicto\nmodal sentences or to singular de re modal sentences.\nAlthough the distinction between de dicto and de re\nmodal sentences was common in logical treatises on the properties of\nthe terms, syncategorematic terms, and the solution of sophisms,\ntwelfth- and thirteenth-century logicians were mainly interested in\nthe logical properties of singular de re modal sentences.\nThere is no detailed theory of quantified de re modal\nsentences from this period, and the first movements in this direction\nby Abelard and his followers were rather confused. A satisfactory\ntheory of de re modal sentences did not appear until the\nfourteenth century, when the various relations between such sentences\nwas presented by John Buridan in his octagon of opposition.\n\nMedieval logicians generally assumed that Aristotle dealt with de\ndicto modal sentences in the De Interpretatione and\nde re modal sentences in the Prior Analytics. In\nearly commentaries on the Prior Analytics, there is usually\nno mention of Abelard\u2019s distinction between them. One reason may be\nthat the only theory available concentrated on singular de re\nmodal sentences, which are not part of modal syllogistic as developed\nby Aristotle.\n\nWhile the de dicto/de re terminology was used, it was not all\nthat common. Medieval logicians preferred to use what they took to be\nAristotle\u2019s terminology, talking about modal sentences in the\ncomposite sense (in sensu composito) and divided sense\n(in sensu diviso). The structure of a composite modal\nsentence can be represented as follows:\n\n(quantity/subject/copula, [quality]/predicate)mode\n\n\nA composite modal sentence corresponds to a de dicto modal\nsentence. The word \u2018composite\u2019 is used because the mode is\nsaid to qualify the composition of the subject and the predicate. The\nstructure of a divided modal sentence can be represented as\nfollows:\n\nquantity/subject/copula, mode, [quality]/predicate\n\n\nHere, the mode is thought to qualify the copula and thus to divide the\nsentence into two parts (hence the name, \u2018divided modal\nsentence\u2019). This type of modal sentence was characterized as\nde re because what is modified is how things (res)\nare related to each other, rather than the truth of what is said by\nthe sentence (dictum) (see Lagerlund 2000: 35\u201339, and\nthe entry on\n medieval theories of modality\n for further details).\n\nLike virtually all medievals, Abelard thought that Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic was a theory for de re modal sentences. He says\nvery little about it in his logical works, however. In less than five\npages in the Dialectica (245\u2013249) he treats modal,\noblique, and temporal syllogistic logic. Earlier in the same work, he\nsays a little about conversion rules. He argues in both the\nDialectica (195\u2013196) and the Logica\n(15\u201316) that the conversion rules can be defended even on a\nde re reading, but the conversions he discusses are not modal\nconversions since the mode must be attached to the predicate and\nfollow the term in the conversion, making the conversion into the\nconversion of an assertoric sentence. The conversions of de\nre modal sentences, as Abelard has defined them, do not hold, as\nPaul Thom has convincingly shown. (Thom 2003: 57\u201358.)\n\nThere is no modal syllogistic explicitly outlined in any of Abelard\u2019s\nlogical works, though in the Dialectica, he exemplifies some\nof the valid mixed moods: M\u2013M in the first figure, MM\u2013 in\nthe second, and M\u2013M in the third (M represents a possibility\nsentence and \u2018\u2013\u2019 an assertoric). He also shows that\nuniform modal syllogisms are not generally valid, so that MMM is not\nvalid unless the middle term in the major premise is read with the\nmode attached to it, as in:\n\nEverything which is possibly B is possibly A\nEvery C is possibly B\nEvery C is possibly A\n\n\nA consequence of this, of course, is that the middle term in the minor\npremise is \u2018possibly B\u2019 and hence no longer a modal\nsentence. MMM is consequently reduced to M\u2013M.\n\nAnything more systematic than this has to be drawn out from Abelard\u2019s\ndefinition of modal sentences and their semantic interpretation. Thom\nhas done this in his book (Thom 2003), where he claims that there is a\nvery specific system developed that is not at all similar to\nAristotle\u2019s modal system. Abelard was therefore not attempting an\ninterpretation of Aristotle, but must be seen as developing a new\nsystem based on his reading of de re sentences. But this\nproject must overcome several problems, particularly since Abelard\ncannot use the conversion rule.\n5. The Early Commentators on the Prior Analytics\n\nThe first known commentary on the Prior Analytics in the\nLatin West is an anonymous work that has recently been edited (Thomsen\nTh\u00f6rnqvist 2015) but is not yet fully studied (see Thomsen\nTh\u00f6rnqvist 2010 and 2013 for more details). The author has been\ncalled Anonymous Aurelianensis III by Sten Ebbesen, who studied parts\nof the work (Ebbesen 1981). He dates it to c. 1160\u201380. The\ntheory of the assertoric syllogism was repeated and summarized in\nalmost all logic works from this time, but there are no other major\nLatin commentaries that we know of until the 1240\u2019s when Robert\nKilwardby (d. 1279) wrote his Literal Commentary on the Books of\nthe Prior Analytics (In libros Priorum Analyticorum\nexpositio). \n\nBy the time Kilwardby wrote his commentary, however, a Latin\ntranslation of a commentary by Averroes on the Prior\nAnalytics was becoming known in the West. Averroes wrote three\nkinds of commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s works, called\n\u2018minor\u2019, \u2018middle\u2019, and \u2018major\u2019 or\n\u2018great\u2019 based on their length and detail. In the 1220s and\n1230s, William of Luna translated Averroes\u2019 middle commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge as well as his middle commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories, On Interpretation,\nand Prior Analytics. In addition to these, a major commentary\non the Posterior Analytics also became available. In the\nmiddle commentaries, Averroes does not go much beyond Aristotle,\nadhering closely to the letter of Aristotle\u2019s text and deviating only\non occasion. Nevertheless, his commentaries played an indispensable\nrole throughout the later Middle Ages in the teaching and study of\nthese difficult texts.\n\nOne thing Averroes does do in these commentaries, however, is to build\na strong connection between logic and a realist metaphysics, which had\na clear influence on thirteenth-century logicians in the Latin West\n(Lagerlund 2000, 2008). In particular, Averroes\u2019s treatment of modal\nsyllogistics is profoundly metaphysical. In his commentary on the\nPrior Analytics, he pursues a line of interpretation which is\nmore developed in the Quaesitum, a short treatise on mixed\nsyllogisms (see Uckelman and Lagerlund 2016). In the\nQuaesitum, Averroes focuses on modal syllogistics and\ndevelops an interpretation based on the metaphysical nature of the\nterms involved in different syllogisms. It has been claimed that this\nshort work is the final result of his inquiries into modal\nsyllogistics (Elamrani-Jamal 1995, p.74). The Quaesitum has\nbeen studied by scholars in detail insofar as it clearly influenced\nRobert Kilwardby (c. 1215\u201379) (Lagerlund 2000, 32\u201335; Thom 2003,\n81\u201391; Lagerlund 2008, 300\u2013302). Although Kilwardby added nothing of\nsubstance to the theory of the assertoric syllogism, his\ninterpretation of modal syllogistic is quite remarkable. It was also\nvery influential in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries.\nAlbert the Great, Simon of Faversham, and Radulphus Brito \u2014 in\nother words, all of the major thirteenth-century commentators on the\nPrior Analytics \u2014 followed Kilwardby in their\ninterpretations.\n\nThroughout the commentary, Kilwardby assumes that Aristotle\u2019s theory\nis correct and makes it his project to find the interpretation that\nshows this. He begins by considering a counterexample to the\naccidental conversion of necessity sentences:\n\n(5:1)\nEvery literate being is necessarily a human being.\n\n\nAccording to the conversion rules accepted by Kilwardby, (5:1) should\nconvert to:\n\n(5:2)\nSome human being is necessarily literate.\n\n\nBut (5:1) is obviously true whereas (5:2) is false.\n\nAs we have seen, this is a common issue for de re readings of\nthe modal sentences. Kilwardby assumes that Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic is a logic for divided (de re) sentences. He\nproceeds to give two separate solutions to this puzzle. The first is\nbased on a distinction between different readings of (5:1). Kilwardby\nexplains that the subject term of a sentence can stand for the subject\nof the inherence (the suppositum), or for the qualification\nthrough which the subject is specified (qualitas/forma). If\nthe term \u2018white\u2019 stands for its suppositum, it\nrefers to a thing that is white or to \u2018that which is\nwhite\u2019, but if it stands for the quality or form, it refers to\nthe whiteness inhering in that which is white, rather than to the\nthing in which it inheres. Kilwardby says that in (5:1),\n\u2018literate being\u2019 stands for its suppositum, which\nexplains why (5:1) is true, whereas in (5:2) the term is taken\ndifferently as standing for the quality or form. According to\nKilwardby, the meaning of the original subject term is changed when it\nno longer stands for the suppositum (literate being), but for\nthe abstract quality of being literate, and it is this change that\nblocks the conversion. (5:2) is true if it is read as:\n\n(5:3)\nSomething that is a human being is necessarily that which is literate.\n\n\nKilwardby, however, preferred another solution to these difficulties\nfor the conversion rules of necessity sentences. The second solution\nis based on a distinction between sentences that are necessary per\nse and those that are necessary per accidens. He writes\n(I, fol. 7rb):\n\nWhen it is said: \u2018Every literate being is necessarily a human\nbeing\u2019, the subject is not something that can be said per\nse of the predicate, but since \u2018literate being\u2019 is\nnot separated from what belongs to a human being in itself, the\nsentence is conceded as necessary, though when a sentence is necessary\nin this way it is necessary per accidens. Therefore, when\nAristotle says that necessity sentences are convertible, he means only\nsentences necessary per se are convertible.\n\n\nThe idea is here that since \u2018human being\u2019 is not\npredicated per se of its subject \u2018literate\nbeing\u2019, the sentence (5:1) is not a per se necessity\nsentence and therefore not convertible. (5:1) is a necessity sentence,\nthough of the per accidens type, since it is necessarily true\nonly in the sense that being human and being literate are not\nseparable. Kilwardby implies that the relation between the subject and\npredicate terms must be of a special kind if a sentence is to be\ncalled necessary per se. In (5:1), \u2018literate\nbeing\u2019 and \u2018human being\u2019 do not have the close\nper se relation Kilwardby demands of a convertible\nsentence.\n\nKilwardby thinks that sentences per se should be understood\nfollowing An. Post. I.4\u20136, where Aristotle discusses\nfour different notions of per se (kath\u2019 hauto)\npredication, though Kilwardby seems only to have the first two in mind\nwhen discussing per se necessity. Aristotle says that the\nfirst type of per se predication (per se primo modo)\noccurs when the definition of the subject includes the predicate. The\nsecond type of per se predication (per se secundo\nmodo) occurs when the definition of the predicate includes the\nsubject. The best characterization of the first type is the\ngenus/species relation, where the definition of a species includes its\ngenus. The second type is often characterized by a proprium\n(property), since a proprium is included in the definition of\na subject, as in \u2018a human being is able to laugh\u2019, where\nthe term \u2018human being\u2019 is included in the definition of\nthe predicate \u2018able to laugh\u2019. A sentence is per\nse necessary if it involves either of these two predications,\naccording to Kilwardby. Necessity per accidens belongs to all\nother necessity sentences, which lack this intrinsic relation between\nsubject and predicate.\n\nKilwardby also stresses that in a per se necessity sentence,\nthe subject must be \u2018something belonging in itself to that\npredicate\u2019 (\u2018per se aliquod ipsius\npredicati\u2019), by which he seems to mean that the subject has\nthe predicate as an essential property, i.e., such that it has the\npredicate as a necessary property through itself and not through\nsomething else. A syllogistic necessity sentence is then understood as\na proposition expressing the essential properties of a thing in a\ngenus/species relationship. He seems to assume that in a per\nse necessity sentence, the subject term is not an accidental term\nbut an essential or necessary term, and that the subject is\nessentially (per se) linked to the predicate rather than\nmerely through the weaker relation of inseparability. Consequently, if\nthe subject term is necessary and the link is necessary, it follows\nthat the predicate term cannot be merely a contingent (accidental)\nterm. It must be necessary as well. The Aristotelian theory of\nnecessity syllogistic is thus limited to a special class of terms, all\nof which stand for substances. The same terminology is also used to\nexplain syllogistic for contingency sentences, which suggests that\nKilwardby was trying to develop a uniform and highly original\ninterpretation of the theory. A number of recent scholars have offered\nsimilar interpretations of Aristotle (see van Rijen 1989, Patterson\n1995, Thom 1996, and Nortmann 1996).\n\nWhen they interpreted Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic, most medievals\nsaw the need to introduce a distinction between different kinds of\nassertoric sentences. In the mixed syllogism L\u2013L (L represents a\nnecessity sentence), the assertoric minor premise cannot be any kind\nof assertoric sentence because then the terms could merely be\naccidentally connected. Kilwardby therefore introduced a distinction\nbetween absolutely (simpliciter) and as-of-now (ut\nnunc) assertoric sentences. The origins of this distinction can\nbe found in Aristotle (An. Pr. I.15, 34b7\u201318), but\nKilwardby of course uses his own per se/per accidens\nterminology to spell out the difference. An absolutely assertoric\nsentence involves a per se predication whereas an as-of-now\nassertoric sentence involves a per accidens predication. In\nthis way, he can guarantee that an essential connection between the\nterms in a valid L\u2013L syllogisms is preserved through to the\nconclusion. This is not unproblematic (see Lagerlund 2000,\n39\u201342), though the distinction between different assertoric\nsentences needed somehow to be made and remained a problem throughout\nthe later Middle Ages.\n\nIn the end, Kilwardby did not arrive at just the moods accepted by\nAristotle. For example, he accepts \u2013LL for the first figure,\nwhich is not accepted by Aristotle, and does not manage to get\n\u2013CC and LCC for Disamis in the third figure. There are also some\nother moods he does not succeed in validating and others still he\ngrants but which are not accepted by Aristotle. But perhaps Kilwardby\ngets as close as one can possibly get to making Aristotle\u2019s system\nconsistent. (See Knuuttila 1996, Lagerlund 2000, and Thom 2003 and\n2007.)\n6. Richard of Campsall\n\nAn important figure in the history of syllogistic logic is Richard of\nCampsall (c. 1280/90\u20131350/60). Sometime before 1308 he wrote his\nQuestions on the Books of the Prior Analytics (Questiones\nsuper librum Priorum Analeticorum), a commentary on the first\nbook of the Prior Analytics that devotes 14 of its 20\nquestions to modal syllogistic. He seems to think that there is\nnothing to add to the theory of assertoric syllogistic and his\npresentation of it is fairly standard, but he has lots of interesting\nthings to say about modal syllogistic. \n\nThe main development of modal syllogistic in Campsall\u2019s work is his\nsystematic application of the distinction between composite (de\ndicto) and divided (de re) modal sentences. Campsall\nseems to have held that the system of modal syllogisms presented in\nthe Prior Analytics was intended for divided modal sentences,\nand so he tries to prove that what Aristotle said is basically correct\nwhen modal sentences are understood in this way. But this turns out to\nbe a very cumbersome task. It is no surprise that he does not quite\nsucceed, as he occasionally admits.\n\nIn his reply to one of the questions in his commentary, he makes a\nbrief remark about the difference between composite and divided modal\nsentences. With regard to universal negative necessity sentences he\nwrites: \u201c[Such a sentence] in the composite sense is singular\nand signifies that the inherence which it modifies is necessary; in\nthe divided sense it is universal and does not signify that the\ninherence that is modified is necessary, but solely that whatever is\ncontained under the predicate necessarily is removed from whatever is\ncontained under the subject\u201d (5.38: 110). The universal negative\nmodal sentence is singular when it is taken in the composite sense,\nthat is, when it is read so that the modality is predicated of what a\nnon-modal proposition expresses (dictum) or, as Campsall\nsays, when it is predicated of the inherence. He goes on to explain\nthat a necessity sentence in the composite sense signifies that the\ncorresponding non-modal sentence is necessarily true. \u2018That\nevery B is not A is necessary\u2019 is thus not universal but\nsingular. When the universal negative necessity proposition is taken\nin the divided sense, it is universal. The modality does not qualify\nthe dictum as a whole, but only the mode of removal of\nwhatever is under the predicate term from whatever is under the\nsubject term.\n\nBoth the conversion rules and the syllogisms for modal sentences in\nthe composite sense are validated by a small number of consequences,\nsuch as:\n\n(6:1)\nIf the antecedent is necessary, then the consequent is necessary.\n\n\nThe corresponding non-modal sentence is here assumed to be valid.\nSimilar consequences can be formed for possibility and contingency\nsentences. These exhaust the theory of syllogism for composite modal\nsentences and Campsall accordingly spends little time elaborating\nit.\n\nIt is natural to assume, as Campsall does, that Aristotle meant his\ntheory of modal syllogisms to cover divided modal sentences, since the\nreading of composite sentences Campsall proposes entails that they are\nall singular and that Aristotle\u2019s theory is not a theory for singular\nsentences. Therefore, he must show how the conversion rules can be\nmade to hold on such a reading of modal sentences.\n\nIn his attempt to give Aristotelian modal syllogistic a consistent\ninterpretation, Campsall is forced to adopt a very artificial reading\nof divided modal sentences. He is clearly influenced by the\nsuppositum approach suggested by Kilwardby, but he thinks\nthat both subject and predicate terms should be taken in this way.\nFurthermore, he states that the terms in divided modal sentences\nshould be taken as standing for that which is now under them. He\nbelieves that with these conditions, the conversion rules and almost\nall of the moods accepted by Aristotle can be shown to be valid.\n\nCampsall also thinks that on such a reading, the following holds:\n\n(6:2)\nC can be one of those that are now under B; therefore, it is one\nof those that are now under B.\n\n\nCampsall takes the terms to signify how things actually are now. If\nthe terms in the sentence \u2018A can be B\u2019 are taken to stand\nfor the things that are at this very moment under them, then \u2018A\ncan be B\u2019 means the same as \u2018A is B\u2019. According to\nCampsall, \u2018Socrates can be white\u2019 should read in the\ndivided sense \u2018That which is Socrates can now be one of those\nthat are now white\u2019. If that which is Socrates can be one of\nthose that are white now, it is one of them; otherwise, Socrates could\nnot have been that particular white being in the first place. Campsall\nthinks that Socrates can be this white being (B1) or that\nwhite being (B2) or \u2026, that is, (B1,\nB2, \u2026, Bn), and if Socrates is not\nactually B1 now, he is B2 now, etc., but\nSocrates will be one of B1 to Bn now. This is\nCampsall\u2019s reason for stating (6:2).\n\nThis is not as crazy as it might first seem. Consider the following\nschema in quantified modal logic:\n\n(6:3)\n\\(\\forall x (Bx \\amp \\Diamond(c = x) \\supset Bc)\\).\n\n\nIf (6:3) is an accurate interpretation of (6:2), then it seems true\nsince \\((\\Diamond(t = t') \\supset(t = t'))\\) is true for identity statements in Kripke\u2019s S5 if\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) are rigid designators.\n\nGiven his interpretation of divided modal sentences and consequences\nlike (6:2), Campsall manages to prove the conversion rules. Like\nKilwardby, he approximates Aristotle\u2019s original system but in the end\ndoes not preserve all of its features. The most interesting features\nof Campsall\u2019s work, however, are not the result of his efforts to\nprove Aristotle right, but of his apparently successful solutions. His\nconcept of contingency allows for simultaneous alternatives, such that\nif something exists, it is possible for it not to exist at that very\nsame moment. Campsall thus abandons the fundamental Aristotelian\nprinciple of the necessity of the present (see Knuuttila 1993 and the\nentry on\n medieval theories of modality\n for discussion of criticisms of this principle in the late thirteenth\ncentury). But Campsall\u2019s analysis is complicated by the fact that, as\nwe have seen, he also accepts the principle that what can exist now\ndoes exist now, and that what does not exist now is necessarily\nnon-existent now. In other words, he denies the necessity of the\npresent for affirmative sentences and accepts it for negative ones.\nThere is thus an asymmetry between affirmative and negative modal\nsentences in Campsall\u2019s system.\n\nAccepting simultaneous alternatives and denying the necessity of the\npresent are typical of modal semantics and modal logic after Campsall,\nespecially in the work of figures such as William of Ockham and John\nBuridan. It is historically interesting that Campsall employs these\nprinciples in his work, even though they are embedded in a theory\nwhose elements point in another direction, towards Kilwardby.\nCampsall\u2019s problematization of the necessity of the present also\nindicates that he wants to separate logic from ontology. In many\nrespects, he paves the way for the next generation of logicians. His\ncomplicated interpretation also shows that no matter how hard one\nmight try, there is no way to give a consistent interpretation of what\nAristotle says in the Prior Analytics (for discussion, see\nLagerlund 2000, Thom 2003 and Knuuttila 2008).\n7. William of Ockham\n\nAround the time William of Ockham (c. 1287\u20131347) wrote his\nCompendium of Logic (Summa logicae), medieval logic\nbegan to change. More emphasis was placed on the theory of\nconsequences than the theory of syllogisms. A theory of consequences\nwas developed by Abelard in the course of his discussion of topical\ninferences and hypothetical syllogisms, and during the thirteenth\ncentury the basic idea was further developed in treatments of the\ntopics, but in the fourteenth century works devoted solely to\nconsequences began to appear (Green-Pedersen 1984). The most famous is\nJohn Buridan\u2019s Treatise on Consequences (Tractatus de\nconsequentiis), though earlier authors such as Walter Burley had\nalso stressed consequences over syllogisms. Burley probably wrote his\nOn the Purity of the Art of Logic (De puritate arte\nlogicae) as a reply to Ockham\u2019s famous Summa. For\nOckham, however, syllogisms are still the most important formal\ninferences, and he devotes most of Book III of the Summa to\nthem (see Normore 1999 for a recent study of Ockham\u2019s logic). \n\nLike Campsall, Ockham has nothing to add to the theory of assertoric\nsyllogisms, which was by then well understood. Let us, however, have a\nlook at the proof method using the expository syllogism that medieval\nlogicians such as Ockham seem to have preferred over Aristotle\u2019s\ncumbersome method of ekthesis. Ockham uses this method\nfrequently, though not as frequently as Buridan later did.\n\nThe method is used to prove the third figure moods. Expository\nsyllogisms are perfect for this because the middle term is the subject\nof both premises in that figure. Darapti, for example, runs as\nfollows:\n\nEvery B is A\nEvery B is C\nSome C is A\n\n\nProofs by expository syllogism are practically self-evident. To prove\nDarapti, one has only to take a particular instantiation of the two\npremises to get:\n\nb is A\nb is C\nOne C is A\n\n\nThe resulting syllogism is an expository syllogism since it has\nsingular terms as subject terms, and so Darapti is proved. This method\nis reminiscent of ekthesis since it involves particular\ninstantiation, though it is not the same method.\n\nAs we have seen, the theory of modal syllogisms was explored in order\nto try to save Aristotle\u2019s theory, and this was still the motive of\nmost logicians in the first half of the fourteenth century. But Ockham\nhimself seems no longer to be interested in this project. His aim\ninstead seems purely systematic, and in his desire to extend his basic\nmethods he manages to bring the theory into a whole new light.\n\nThe most fundamental distinction in modal syllogistic is of course\nthat between composite and divided modal sentences, but divided modal\nsentences are also equivocal according to Ockham. Using ideas\ndeveloped in the theory of supposition, he distinguishes between\ndivided modal sentences with an ampliated subject term and those with\na non-ampliated subject term. Let us look at how Ockham draws the more\nfundamental distinction.\n\nOckham proceeds by dividing modal sentences into sentences with a\ndictum (cum dicto) and those without a\ndictum (sine dicto), dividing modal sentences with a\ndictum into composite and divided senses. He adds that a\nmodal sentence cum dicto taken in the divided sense is always\nequivalent to a modal sentence sine dicto. Ockham expresses\nthe dictum in Latin by an accusative and infinitive\nconstruction. Thus, in the sentence \u2018That every human being is\nan animal is necessary\u2019 (in Latin \u2018Omnem hominem esse\nanimal est necessarium\u2019), \u2018That every human being is\nan animal\u2019 (\u2019Omnem hominem esse animal\u2019) is\nthe dictum of the sentence, which has the mode\n\u2018necessity\u2019 predicated of it. He treats the\ndictum as the subject term of the modal sentence, and the\nmode as the predicate term. It is important to distinguish between the\ndictum and an assertoric sentence. The dictum is\nwhat is asserted in an assertoric sentence. Thus, when the\ndictum is said to be necessary or possible and there is a\nsentence asserting it, such a sentence is necessarily or possibly true\n(Summa logicae II, 9).\n\nAs noted by Campsall, the fact that both the dictum and the\nmode are treated as terms has an important consequence for composite\nmodal sentences. \u2018That every B is A is necessary\u2019 is,\naccording to the reading suggested, not a universal affirmative but a\nsingular affirmative sentence. Ockham adds that one can also call such\nsentences universal or particular, depending on whether the original\nsentence \u2014 that is, the sentence referred to by the\ndictum \u2014 is universal or particular.\n\nThe syllogistic for composite modal sentences is equally\nstraightforward and reduces to a few valid consequences. He explicitly\nmentions the following six (Summa logicae III-1):\n\n(7:1)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are necessary, so is the conclusion\n(7:2)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are possible and\ncompossible, then the conclusion is possible\n(7:3)\nIf the premises of a valid argument are contingent and\ncompossible, then the conclusion is contingent\n(7:4)\nA necessity sentence, whether in the composite or divided sense,\nalways entails the corresponding assertoric sentence\n(7:5)\nAn assertoric sentence entails the corresponding possibility\nsentence\n\n\n(7:4) and (7:5) are used by Ockham to get:\n\n(7:6)\nA necessity sentence entails the corresponding possibility\nsentence\n\n\nIt is consequences such as these that give Ockham a syllogistic for\ncomposite modal sentences. He simply takes the standard assertoric\nsyllogistic and applies these rules to them. Ockham\u2019s syllogistic for\ndivided modal sentences, however, is much less straightforward.\n\nIn Book III-1, Ockham expresses the equivocal nature of divided modal\nsentences as follows:\n\nBut if the possibility proposition is taken in the divided sense or if\none takes a proposition equivalent to it \u2014 such as the\npropositions, \u2018Every human being can be white\u2019, \u2018A\nwhite being can be black\u2019 and the like \u2014 then this\nproposition must be distinguished by virtue of the third mode of\nequivocation, in the way that a subject can supposit for those that\nare or for those that can be, that is, in the way that a subject can\nsupposit for that about which a thing is verified with a word about\nthe present or for that about which a thing is verified with a word\nabout the possible; or else it denotes what it can supposit for, which\nI say to exclude quibbling. If this is said about \u2018Every white\nbeing can be a human being\u2019, then one sense is,\n\u2018Everything that is white can be a human being\u2019, and in\nthis sense it is true as long as nothing is white except a human\nbeing. Another sense is, \u2018Everything that can be white can be a\nhuman being\u2019, and this is false, provided either only a human\nbeing is white or something other than a human being [is white].\n\n\nHere he clearly states that a possibility sentence has two readings,\nnamely:\n\n(7:7)\n(Quantity) what is B can be (quality) A\n(7:8)\n(Quantity) what can be B can be (quality) A\n\n\n(7:8) has generated some scholarly debate as to what Ockham really\nmeant by this reading of divided possibility sentences. Does he mean\nby (7:8) that the subject term is ampliated to stand for possible\nbeings as well as for actual beings? Can a strict nominalist such as\nOckham really accept quantification over possible beings? (For the\ndetails, see Karger 1980, Freddoso 1980, McGrade 1985, Knuuttila 1993:\n139\u201349, and Lagerlund 2000: 107\u2013112.)\n\nOckham also thinks that contingency sentences are equivocal in the\nsame sense as possibility sentences, but not necessity sentences. The\nonly reading he accepts for these sentences is:\n\n(7:10)\n(Quantity) what is B is necessarily (quality) A.\n\n\n(7:10) implies that only actually existing things have necessary\nproperties. It is unclear why he thinks this (see Lagerlund 2000:\n112\u2013114), but it gives his syllogistic an unattractive feature\nthat has awkward consequences. For example, no conversion rules for\ndivided necessity sentences are valid and there are also no valid\nmoods in the second figure.\n\nOckham also discusses syllogisms with mixed composite and divided\nmodal premises. He mentions some very interesting consequences in the\ncourse of this discussion.\n\n(7:11)\nThat every B is A is possible \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(7:12)\nThat some B is A is possible \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(7:13)\nThat this is A is possible \\(\\equiv\\) This is possibly A\n(7:14)\nThat this is A is contingent \\(\\equiv\\) This is contingently A\n(7:15)\nThat this is A is necessary \\(\\equiv\\) This is necessarily A\n\n\nIn (7:11) and (7:12), the subject terms of divided modal sentences\nmust be ampliated for the consequences to hold. It is interesting to\nnote that for categorical sentences with singular subject terms, the\ndistinction between composite and divided senses collapses. His\nexample is \u2018That Socrates is white is possible\u2019 implies\n\u2018Socrates is possibly white\u2019. With the help of these\nconsequences he can prove some additional moods to be valid in the\ndifferent figures. (See Lagerlund 2000: 124\u201329, and for a\nsystematic reconstruction see Klima 2008.)\n8. John Buridan\n\nJohn Buridan (c. 1300\u20131361) was the foremost logician of the\nlater Middle Ages and in his hands the theory of the syllogism was\nreworked and developed well beyond anything seen before in the history\nof logic. His two most important logical works are the Treatise on\nConsequence and the Summulae de Dialectica. The\npresentation here is primarily based on the Treatise (for\nfurther discussion, see Lagerlund 2000, Chapter 5, and Zupko 2003,\nChapters 5\u20136). \n\nIn the Treatise, Buridan bases his discussion of the\nsyllogism on a philosophical semantics that views syllogistic\ninference as a special case of the much more comprehensive theory of\nconsequences. Like his immediate predecessors, he was for the most\npart uninterested in assertoric syllogisms and moves on quickly to\ntemporal, oblique, variation, and modal syllogisms, though this does\nnot prevent him from making some original contributions to the theory\nof the assertoric syllogism.\n\nAccording to Buridan, a syllogism is a formal consequence, and so\nsyllogistic becomes a branch of the theory of formal consequence. As\nconsequences, syllogisms are distinguished by their conjunctive\nantecedent and single-sentence consequent, and furthermore by their\nthree terms \u2014 though this last condition is not necessary since\nBuridan also treats of syllogisms with more than three terms.\n\nBuridan treats of the three famous figures and notes that a conclusion\ncan be either direct or indirect. In an indirect conclusion, the minor\nterm is predicated of the major instead of the other way around. Since\nthe premises are part of a conjunction and together form the\nantecedent of a consequent, they can easily switch places, which means\nthat Buridan can define the fourth figure as a first figure with\ntransposed premises and an indirect conclusion. Hence, he does not\nneed to discuss it independently of the first figure.\n\nFor Buridan, a formal consequence holds by the principle of uniform\nsubstitution. It is valid for any uniform substitution of its\ncategorematic terms. A syllogism is a special kind of formal\nconsequence since it requires for its validity that terms be conjoined\nacross sentences. How the principle of uniform substitution is\nsupposed to work here is a bit tricky and forces him to bring into\nplay his general semantics as well as the notion of distribution. To\nspell out the relation of their terms and hence the validity of the\nfirst figure syllogisms, he reformulates the traditional dici de\nomni et nullo rules (see King 1985: 71):\n\n(8:1)\nAny two terms, which are called the same as a third by reason of\nthe same thing for which that third term supposits, not collectively,\nare correctly called the same as each other.\n(8:2)\nAny two terms, of which one is called the same as some third term\nof which the other is called not the same by reason of the same thing\nfor which that third term supposits, are correctly called not the same\nas each other.\n\n\nOne could say a great deal about these rules, but the term that does\nmost of the heavy lifting is \u2018supposits\u2019. Supposition is a\ntheory of reference and it is the coreferentiality of terms in the\ndifferent sentences in a syllogism that is the decisive factor in\ndetermining whether the principle of uniform substitution is satisfied\nor not. It is at this point that he introduces the theory of\ndistribution.\n\nThe rules governing the distribution of terms in a sentence are given\nas part of his account of common personal supposition. A term is\ndistributed in a sentence if it is taken to refer to everything it\nsignifies, such as if the term is in the scope of a universal\nquantifier. To indicate when a term is distributed he gives five\nrules, according to which universals distribute subjects, negatives\ndistribute predicates, and no other terms are distributed. If we stay\nwithin the square of opposition (Buridan\u2019s theory of distribution, and\nhence his syllogistic, has wide application, extending far beyond the\ntraditional A, E, I, and O sentences), this implies that universal\naffirmative sentences have their subject terms distributed, universal\nnegatives have both terms distributed, particular affirmatives have\nneither term distributed, and particular negatives have only their\npredicate terms distributed. (For an influential criticism of this\ntheory of distribution see Geach 1962, and King 1985 for a reply.)\n\nWith his theory of distribution in place, Buridan turns to the\nsyllogisms, and we see now that in order for a combination of premises\nto be acceptable, the middle terms must be distributed \u2014\notherwise we will not have a formally acceptable consequence. Buridan\napproaches the problem in combinatorial fashion. Given the four\nsentences and two possible positions for each we get 16 possible\ncombinations. Some of these can be ruled out immediately based on the\nrules for distribution. A combination with only negative premises will\nnot work at all; hence EE, EO, OE, and OO must be rejected. II has\nboth middle terms undistributed and can thus be rejected. In the first\nfigure, IA, OA, and OI have an undistributed middle. The other eight\nare accepted. In the second figure, we see that AA, AI, and IA must be\nrejected because of an undistributed middle. The other eight are\naccepted. In the third figure, IO and OI have an undistributed middle\nbut the remaining nine combinations are accepted.\n\nAt first glance, there are some surprises in Buridan\u2019s presentation of\nassertoric syllogistic. In the second figure he accepts indirect\nconclusions for IEO (Tifesno) and OAO (Robaco), and in the third\nfigure indirect conclusions for AOO (Carbodo), AEO (Lapfeton), and IEO\n(Rifeson). He also accepts syllogisms concluding to what he calls an\n\u201cuncommon idiom for negatives,\u201d that is, when the\npredicate term precedes the negation, as in \u2018Some B A is\nnot\u2019 (Quaedam B A est non). Such sentences make no\nsense in English, but Buridan treats them as equivalent to sentences\nwhere the predicate term quantified, as in \u2018Some B is not some\nA\u2019. He writes the sentences in this way because otherwise they\nwould violate his rules for distribution and scope. Syllogisms\nconcluding to an \u201cuncommon idiom for negatives\u201d add\nanother three valid forms in the first figure and two in the second.\nIf we tally this up and include all of the indirect conclusions, we\nget 33 valid moods, as opposed to 19 in Aristotelian syllogistic. If\nwe then add the supplementary subalternate conclusions, we get 24\nvalid moods in traditional syllogistic but 38 in Buridan\u2019s\nsystematization.\n\nBuridan is quite right to accept these additional 14 moods. They are\nvalid. But his result is not as dramatic as it seems since the middle\nterms are either in the subject or predicate position. In the second\nand third figure an indirect conclusion becomes equivalent to\ntransposing the premises. Hence Buridan\u2019s Tifesno, Robaco, Carbodo,\nLapfeton, and Rifeson reduce to Festino, Baroco, Bocardo, Felapton,\nand Ferison, respectively. This is also obvious if we look at the\nnames of these syllogisms, which suggest that Buridan has only\nreshuffled the letters of the names of the standard Aristotelian\nsyllogisms. After having done all this over just a few pages \u2014\nas mentioned above, Buridan is rather uninterested in assertoric\nsyllogistic \u2014 he turns to the temporal, oblique, and modal\nsyllogistic. Of these, it is modal syllogistic to which he devotes the\nmost time.\n\nA temporal syllogism consists of sentences whose copulas involve\ntemporal ampliation. In such sentences, the supposition of the subject\nterm is extended to include past and future things as well as present\nthings. The syllogistic for sentences involving oblique terms is\nimportant for Buridan\u2019s general theory of consequence, since this is\nwhere we find rules governing the behavior of oblique terms in\ndistributive contexts. His investigation is extraordinarily detailed\nand extremely rigorous, qualities all the more impressive when we\nconsider that he did not have the representational tools of modern\nsymbolic logic.\n\nThe syllogistic for composite modal sentences is straightforward and\nBuridan uses only a couple of pages in the Treatise to sketch\nits basic structure. The theory of the syllogism for divided modal\nsentences is given a much more thorough treatment. For Buridan, a\nmodal copula always ampliates its subject term to stand not only for\npresent, past, and future things but also possible things, unless the\nsupposition of the subject term is explicitly restricted to what is\nactual. On this basis, he can give an exhaustive account of the\nlogical relations between quantified divided modal sentences, which he\npresents in the octagon of opposition. Slightly simplified, and\nassuming that the complete octagon can be formed by some trivial\nequivalences holding between the modalities, it can be depicted as in\nFigure 1:\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nTogether with the octagon he also uses some consequences to prove the\nvalid syllogisms. He first states the valid conversion rules:\n\n(8:3)\nEvery B is possibly A \\(\\supset\\) Some A is possibly B\n(8:4)\nSome B is possibly A \\(\\equiv\\) Some A is possibly B\n(8:5)\nEvery B is necessarily not A \\(\\equiv\\) Every A is necessarily not B\n(8:6)\n(Quantity) B is contingently A \\(\\equiv\\) (Quantity) B is\ncontingently not A\n\n\nAll these are valid assuming their subject terms are ampliated. He\nalso employs the following consequences:\n\n(8:7)\nEvery B is necessarily not A \\(\\supset\\) Every B is not A\n(8:8)\n(Quantity) which is B is necessarily A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B is A\n(8:9)\n(Quantity) B is A \\(\\supset\\) Some B is possibly A\n(8:10)\n(Quantity) B is necessarily (quality) A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B\nis possibly (quality) A\n(8:11)\n(Quantity) B is contingently (quality) A \\(\\supset\\) (Quantity) B is \npossibly (quality) A\n\n\nBy stating these consequences and the octagon of opposition, Buridan\nhas presented a virtually exhaustive syntactical account of modal\nlogic, and, together with his semantics of supposition and\ndistribution, constructed a powerful logic unmatched by anything\npresented in the history of logic before him.\n\nBuridan uses four methods to prove the valid syllogistic moods. All\nfirst figure moods are proved by the rules of class inclusion, that\nis, the dici de omni and dici de nullo rules. The\nsecond and third figure moods are proved using three different\nmethods: either by conversion \u2014 that is, by (8:3), (8:4), (8:5)\nor (8:6) \u2014 by reductio ad impossibile, or by expository\nsyllogism. Proof by impossibility is used on a few occasions, but\nBuridan\u2019s approach here differs in no way from Aristotle\u2019s. This\nfourth way is frequently used to prove the valid third figure moods.\nSince the number of possible combinations of premises and conclusions\nin modal syllogistic is quite extensive, he limits himself to\ndiscussing those moods whose assertoric counterparts are valid, but\neven so he manages to discuss a large number of valid and invalid\nsyllogisms (see Hughes 1989, Lagerlund 2000, Thom 2003, Klima 2008,\nand Dutilh Novaes 2008).\n\nThere has been considerable scholarly discussion of Buridan\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic. It has been asked in particular whether it corresponds to\nany modern system of modal logic. The most popular answer is S5 (King\n1985). Some have argued that Buridan must have been thinking in terms\nof some kind of possible worlds model (Hughes 1989 and Knuuttila\n1993). Such comparisons of course reflect the extent to which these\nscholars have been impressed by Buridan\u2019s modal logic, which was\nwithout equal until the late twentieth century.(For an example of just\nhow powerful his general logic was see Parsons 2014.)\n9. Later Medieval Developments of the Theory\n\nSyllogistic logic reached the height of its development in Buridan and\nfor the next two hundred years, little was said about it. Buridan\u2019s\nyounger associates at Paris, Albert of Saxony and Marsilius of Inghen,\nwere both competent logicians, but neither made any substantive\nadditions to the theory developed by their master. Paul of Venice was\na well-known early fifteenth-century logician, but he had little to\nsay about the theory of the syllogism. In the late fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries, several very good logicians wrote books on logic,\nperhaps the most skillful being Jodocus Trutfetter, a follower of\nOckham who is better known as a teacher of Martin Luther. But\nTrutfetter\u2019s logic is wholly based on Buridan. In his massive work,\nthe modestly titled, Little Compendium of the Whole of Logic\n(Summulae totius logicae), he extends modal logic beyond\nBuridan to include discussions of epistemic and doxastic modalities.\nHis treatment of syllogistic is perhaps the most extensive in the\nmedieval tradition. \n\nAs noted above, the syllogistic logic of Ockham and Buridan was not\nprimarily aimed at saving Aristotle. But historical interest in\nAristotle returned in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and\nsome scholars, mainly from the Thomistic and Albertist traditions,\nwanted to know what Aristotle had said about syllogistic. There was\nalso the nominalist commentator George of Brussels, who tried to offer\na historically accurate interpretation of Aristotle together with a\nsystematic account along the lines of Buridan. It is interesting to\nnote that the modal syllogistic these philosophers ascribe to\nAristotle is identical to that provided under Kilwardby\u2019s\ninterpretation. (For further discussion of modal logic in the later\nMiddle Ages, see Coombs 1990, Roncaglia 1996, and Lagerlund 2000,\nChapter 8.)\n10. Summary\n\nThe theory of the syllogism was the most important logical theory\nduring the Middle Ages and for a long time it was practically\nsynonymous with logic as a discipline. Buridan altered this picture by\nmaking syllogistic part of a much larger and more complex logic of\nconsequence. \n\nAt first, medieval commentators on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics sought to save what they took to be Aristotle\u2019s\noriginal system. Kilwardby thought this could be done by interpreting\nmodal sentences in light of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics of essence\ntogether with his account of essential prediction in the Posterior\nAnalytics. This was a very influential interpretation, but it was\nultimately abandoned because it did not succeed in saving\nAristotle.\n\nIn the early fourteenth century, Campsall tried to save Aristotle by\ndeveloping a more radical interpretation restricting the supposition\nof subject and predicate terms in modal sentences. This enabled him to\nprove the conversion rules and many of the syllogistic moods accepted\nby Aristotle, but not even this interpretation could make sense of the\nPrior Analytics.\n\nBy the second quarter of the fourteenth century, modal logic had begun\nto change and new distinctions were used to develop the theory of the\nmodal syllogism, such as the distinction between de dicto and\nde re modal sentences. Ockham was the first simply to abandon\nAristotle\u2019s theory in favor of a newer and more systematic account. He\nwas not quite successful, however, and it was left to Buridan to\nsubsume modal syllogistic as part of his larger project of\nsystematizing the whole of logic.\n\nThe history of syllogistic does not end with the Middle Ages, of\ncourse, but it is fair to say that the theory did not really change in\nthe six centuries since Buridan. What did change, and for the worse,\nwas people\u2019s knowledge of the original sources and hence also of the\nrichness and sophistication of medieval logic, a state of ignorance\nthat made the doctrine easy for logicians of the early twentieth\ncentury to ridicule.\n",
