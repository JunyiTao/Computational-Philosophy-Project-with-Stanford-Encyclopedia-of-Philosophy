    "main_text": "Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell\n6. Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell\n\nRussell\u2019s discovery in 1901 of the Russell Paradox led him\nwithin a few months, in a letter to Frege (Frege [PMC]: 144) to propose\na tentative version of the theory of types. The central idea he took\nfrom Frege\u2019s theory of functions of the first, second, and\nhigher orders. Russell presented a version of his theory in an\nappendix to the Principles of Mathematics (1903), and then in\na mature form in his \u201cMathematical Logic as Based on the Theory\nof Types\u201d (1908), which provided the conceptual underpinnings\nfor Principia Mathematica. Russell views the universe as\nstriated into levels or types. The first type comprises the\nindividuals; the second type comprises the \u201cfirst-order\u201d\npropositions whose quantifiers range over the individuals of the first\ntype; in general, the quantifiers in propositions of the n+1st\ntype range over propositions of the nth type. Russell\u2019s\nsystem in fact comprises two distinct hierarchies: one to deal with\nthe paradoxes of set theory (specifically, to prohibit sets from being\nelements of themselves); the other to deal with the semantical\nparadoxes (such as the paradox of the liar). This dual structure,\nbranching in two directions, gives his theory the name \u201cramified\ntheory of types\u201d. In order to be able to establish classical\nanalysis, he was forced to adopt the axiom of reducibility, which\nprovides that any function of level \\(n+1\\) is coextensive with a\npredicate of function of lower level. The system was immensely\ncomplicated; in time, at the hands of Chwistek, Ramsey, Carnap,\nTarski, and Church, it was recognized that the hierarchy dealing with\nthe semantical paradoxes could be pruned away, leaving the\n\u201csimple theory of types\u201d. (A survey of this evolution can\nbe found in Church 1974, and detailed examinations of Russell\u2019s\ntheory in Landini 1998 and Linsky 2011.)\n\nRussell and Whitehead thus possessed a notation for the two\nquantifiers, as well as a distinction between quantifications of the\nfirst and higher types. But this is not the same as\npossessing a conception of first-order logic, conceived as a\nfree-standing logical system, worthy of study in its own right. There\nwere essentially two things blocking the way. First (and in contrast\nto Peirce), their object of study was not multiple logical systems,\nbut logic tout court: they show no interest in splitting off\na fragment for separate study, let alone in arguing that the\nfirst-order fragment enjoys a privileged status. On the contrary: as\nwith Frege, the ambition of Principia was to demonstrate that\nmathematics can be reduced to logic, and for Whitehead and Russell\nlogic encompassed the full apparatus of ramified type theory (together\nwith the axioms of infinity, choice, and reducibility). Secondly,\nalthough Principia provided an axiomatization of type theory\n(and thus can be viewed as specifying a conception of deductive\nconsequence), Whitehead and Russell thought of their system as an\ninterpreted system, stating the truths of logic, rather than\nas a formal calculus in the sense of Hilbert. Hilbert was to use their\naxiomatization as the starting-point for his own axiomatizations of\nvarious systems of logic; but until the distinction between logic and\nmetalogic had been formulated, it did not naturally occur to anybody\nto pose the metalogical questions of completeness, consistency, and\ndecidability, or to investigate such matters as the relationship\nbetween deductive and semantic completeness, or failures of\ncategoricity; and it was only once such notions became the focus of\nattention that the significance of first-order logic became\napparent.\n",
