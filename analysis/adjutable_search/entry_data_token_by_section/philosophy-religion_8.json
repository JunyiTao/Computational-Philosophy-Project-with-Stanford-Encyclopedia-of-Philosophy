Philosophical Reflection on Theism and Its Alternatives\n\nFor much of the history of philosophy of religion, there has been\nstress on the assessment of theism. Non-theistic concepts of the\ndivine have increasingly become part of philosophy of religion (see,\nfor example, Buckareff & Nagasawa 2016; Diller & Kasher 2013;\nand Harrison 2006, 2012, 2015).\n Section 6\n makes special note of this broadening of horizons. As noted at the\noutset of this entry, theism still has some claim for special\nattention given the large world population that is aligned with\ntheistic traditions (the Abrahamic faiths and theistic Hinduism) and\nthe enormity of attention given to the defense and critique of theism\nin philosophy of religion historically and today.\n",
