    "main_text": "Objectivity as Freedom from Personal Biases || Feyerabend: The Tyranny of the Rational Method\n4.3 Feyerabend: The Tyranny of the Rational Method\n\nIn his writings of the 1970s,\n Paul Feyerabend\n launched a profound attack on the rationality and objectivity of\nscientific method. His position is exceptional in the philosophical\nliterature since traditionally, the threat for objective and\nsuccessful science is located in contextual rather than epistemic\nvalues. Feyerabend turns this view upside down: it is the\n\u201ctyranny\u201d of rational method, and the emphasis on\nepistemic rather than contextual values that prevents us from having a\nscience in the service of society. Moreover, he welcomes a diversity\nof different personal, also idiosyncratic perspectives, thus denying\nthe idea that freedom from personal \u201cbias\u201d is\nepistemically and socially beneficial.\n\nThe starting point of Feyerabend\u2019s criticism of rational method\nis the thesis that strict epistemic rules such as those expressed by\nthe VFI only suppress an open exchange of ideas, extinguish scientific\ncreativity and prevent a free and truly democratic science. In his\nclassic \u201cAgainst Method\u201d (1975: chs. 8\u201313),\nFeyerabend elaborates on this criticism by examining a famous episode\nin the history of science. When the Catholic Church objected to\nGalilean mechanics, it had the better arguments by the standards of\nseventeenth-century science. Their conservatism in their position was\nscientifically backed: Galilei\u2019s telescopes were unreliable for\ncelestial observations, and many well-established phenomena (no fixed\nstar parallax, invariance of laws of motion) could not yet be\nexplained in the heliocentric system. With hindsight, Galilei managed\nto achieve groundbreaking scientific progress just because he\ndeliberately violated rules of scientific reasoning. Hence\nFeyerabend\u2019s dictum \u201cAnything goes\u201d: no methodology\nwhatsoever is able to capture the creative and often irrational ways\nby which science deepens our understanding of the world. Good\nscientific reasoning cannot be captured by rational method, as Carnap,\nHempel and Popper postulated.\n\nThe drawbacks of an objective, value-free and method-bound view on\nscience and scientific method are not only epistemic. Such a view\nnarrows down our perspective and makes us less free, open-minded,\ncreative, and ultimately, less human in our thinking (Feyerabend 1975:\n154). It is therefore neither possible nor desirable to have an\nobjective, value-free science (cf. Feyerabend 1978: 78\u201379). As a\nconsequence, Feyerabend sees traditional forms of inquiry about our\nworld (e.g., Chinese medicine) on a par with their Western\ncompetitors. He denounces appeals to \u201cobjective\u201d standards\nas rhetorical tools for bolstering the epistemic authority of a small\nintellectual elite (=Western scientists), and as barely disguised\nstatements of preference for one\u2019s own worldview:\n\n\nthere is hardly any difference between the members of a\n\u201cprimitive\u201d tribe who defend their laws because they are\nthe laws of the gods [\u2026] and a rationalist who appeals to\n\u201cobjective\u201d standards, except that the former know what\nthey are doing while the latter does not. (1978: 82)\n\n\nIn particular, when discussing other traditions, we often project our\nown worldview and value judgments into them instead of making an\nimpartial comparison (1978: 80\u201383). There is no purely rational\njustification for dismissing other perspectives in favor of the\nWestern scientific worldview\u2014the insistence on our Western\napproach may be as justified as insisting on absolute space and time\nafter the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThe Galilei example also illustrates that personal perspective and\nidiosyncratic \u201cbias\u201d need not be bad for science.\nFeyerabend argues further that scientific research is accountable to\nsociety and should be kept in check by democratic institutions, and\nlaymen in particular. Their particular perspectives can help to\ndetermine the funding agenda and to set ethical standards for\nscientific inquiry, but also be useful for traditionally value-free\ntasks such as choosing an appropriate research method and assessing\nscientific evidence. Feyerabend\u2019s writings on this issue were\nmuch influenced by witnessing the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S.\nand the increasing emancipation of minorities, such as Blacks, Asians\nand Hispanics.\n\nAll this is not meant to say that truth loses its function as a\nnormative concept, nor that all scientific claims are equally\nacceptable. Rather, Feyerabend advocates an epistemic\npluralism that accepts diverse approaches to acquiring\nknowledge. Rather than defending a narrow and misleading ideal of\nobjectivity, science should respect the diversity of values and\ntraditions that drive our inquiries about the world (1978:\n106\u2013107). This would put science back into the role it had\nduring the scientific revolution or the Enlightenment: as a liberating\nforce that fought intellectual and political oppression by the\nsovereign, the nobility or the clergy. Objections to this view are\ndiscussed at the end of\n section 5.2.\n",
