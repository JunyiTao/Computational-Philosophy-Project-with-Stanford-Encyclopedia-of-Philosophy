    "main_text": "Film Narration\n5. Film Narration\nFiction films tell stories.  Unlike literary media such as\nnovels, they do so with images and sound\u2014including both\nwords and music.  Clearly, some films have narrators.  These\nnarrators are generally character narrators, narrators who are\ncharacters within the fictional world of the film.  They tell us\nthe film's stories and, supposedly, show us the images that we see.\n Sometimes, however, a voice-over narration presents us with an\napparently objective view of the situation of the characters, as if it\noriginated from outside of the film world.  In addition, there are\nfiction films, films that tell stories, in which there is no clear\nagent who is doing the telling. These facts have given rise to a number\nof puzzles about film narration that have been discussed by\nphilosophers of film. (See Chatman (1990) and Gaut (2004).)\nOne central issue that has been a subject of controversy among\nphilosophers is unreliable narration.  There are films in which the\naudience comes to see that the character narrator of the film has a\nlimited or misguided view of the film world.  One example is Max\nOphuls' Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), a film that has\nbeen discussed by a number of different philosophers.  The majority of\nthe film is a voice-over narration by Lisa Berndle, the unknown woman\nof the film's title, who recites the words of the letter she sends to\nher lover, Max Brand, shortly before her death.  The audience comes to\nsee that Lisa has a distorted view of the events she narrates, most\nclearly in her misestimation of the character of Brand.  This raises\nthe question of how the audience can come to know that Lisa's view is\ndistorted, since what we hear and see is narrated (or shown) by her.\nGeorge Wilson (1986) has argued that unreliable narratives such as\nthis require the positing of an implicit narrator of the film, while\nGregory Currie (1995) has argued that an implied filmmaker suffices.\nThis question has become very relevant with the increased popularity\nof filmmaking styles involving unreliable narration.  Bryan\nSinger's The Usual Suspects (1995) touched off a flurry of\nfilms whose narrators were unreliable in one way or another.\nA\nrelated issue concerning narrative that has been a\nfocus of debate is whether all films have narrators,\nincluding those without explicit ones.  Initially, it was argued\nthat the idea of a narratorless narrative did not make sense, that\nnarration required an agent doing the narrating, who was the film's\nnarrator.  In\ncases where there were no explicit narrators, an implicit narrator\nneeded to be posited to make sense of how viewers gained access to the\nfictional world of the film.  Opponents responded that the\nnarrator in the sense of the agent who gave film audiences access to a\nfilm's fictional world could be the filmmaker(s), so there was no need\nto posit such a dubious entity as an implicit narrator of a film.\n\n\nThere is, however, an even deeper problem in regard to film narration\nover what has been called the \u201cImagined Seeing Thesis\u201d\n(Wilson 1997).  According to this Thesis, viewers of mainstream\nfiction films imagine themselves to be looking into the world of the\nstory and seeing segments of the narrative action from a series of\ndefinite visual perspectives.  In its traditional version, viewers are\ntaken to imagine the movie screen as a kind of window that allows them\nto watch the unfolding of the story on the \u201cother side.\u201d\nHowever, it is hard for this view to account for what is being\nimagined when, for example, the camera moves, or there is an edit to a\nshot that incorporates a different perspective on a scene, etc.  As a\nresult, an alternative view has been suggested, namely that viewers\nimagine themselves to be seeing motion picture images that have been\nphotographically derived, in some indeterminate way, from within the\nfictional world itself.  But this position runs into problems, since\nit is normally part of the film's fiction that no camera was present\nin the fictional space of the narrative.  The resulting debate is over\nwhether to reject as incoherent the Imagined Seeing Thesis or whether\nit is possible to develop an acceptable version of this Thesis.\nPhilosophers remain sharply divided on this fundamental issue.\nThe\ntopic of film narration thus continues to be a subject of intense\nphilosophical\ndiscussion and investigation.  Various attempts to explain its\nnature remain hotly debated.  As new and more complex styles of\nfilm narration become popular, it is likely that the subject of film\nnarration will continue to receive attention from philosophers and\naestheticians.\n",
