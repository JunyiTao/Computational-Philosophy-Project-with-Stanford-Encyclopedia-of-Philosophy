    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy || Justifications of Parsimony\n2.3 Justifications of Parsimony\n\nParsimony methods were among the very first adopted by cladists. This\nis often taken to include Hennig (1966), who laid out a process of\nphylogenetic inference that is now referred to as \u201cHennigian\nreasoning\u201d in his seminal text Phylogenetic Systematics\n(Baum & Smith 2013). Like other forms of parsimony, this method\nsought to identify the tree that explained the distribution of\nhomologies by appeal to the fewest number of evolutionary events.\n\nParsimony techniques have grown more sophisticated, and, as larger\ndata sets have been assessed and bigger trees constructed,\njustifications of parsimony approaches advanced and adapted. Early on,\nmuch of this took place in the context of the Systematics Wars\n (\u00a71.2.1),\n where a premium was placed on defending approaches as properly\nscientific. Thus, these debates tended to veer into philosophy of\nscience, with systematists disputing what counted as doing good\nscience in the context of inferring history. This helps explain the\ninfluence of\n Karl Popper\u2019s\n work\n\n. Early\nproponents of parsimony were attracted to Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationist account of the scientific method, both in the way it\nprovided demarcation criteria for scientific activity, and in the way\nit was positioned as critical of\n logical positivist\n\napproaches. Falsificationist justifications were employed to criticize\nnumerical taxonomists as verificationists relying on flawed\nhypothetico-deductive methods.\n\nWiley (1975) provides a representative example of a falsificationist\ndefense of parsimony that proved deeply influential, e.g., Eldredge\n& Cracraft (1980) adopt Wiley\u2019s core justification in their\ninfluential textbook, as does Farris (1983) in his impactful defense\nof parsimony. On Wiley\u2019s account, each taxonomic character is\ntreated as an homology, and considered independently of all others.\nFor each homology, a tree hypothesis is generated that requires the\nfewest number of evolutionary changes to explain the pattern of\ncharacter distribution across taxa. These are hypotheses of homology\nand, on the falsificationist account, these hypotheses are mutually\ntestable. That is, the tree hypotheses generated for each character\nconstitutes a test of the trees hypothesized for every other\ncharacter; falsified hypotheses of homology are treated as ad hoc\nassumptions of homoplasy. The maximum parsimony tree is that topology\nwhich generates the fewest falsified hypotheses of homology, and is\nregarded as the most corroborated tree. Adding new characters or taxa\nconstitutes further testing of these hypotheses, and generates more\npotential falsifiers. In this way, parsimony is simultaneously a mode\nof tree construction and evaluation (Haber 2009); Wiley (1975),\nEldredge and Cracraft (1980), and Farris (1983) describe this as a\nlogical basis of reasoning about phylogenetic inference, citing the\nphilosophical justification of falsificationism.\n\nWhether this represents a faithful account of Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism, or whether falsificationism represents the\noptimal (or even a desirable) mode of scientific reasoning has been a\nmatter taken up by philosophers (Hull 1983, 1999; Sober 1988b), though\nthat is, in some ways, beside the point. (For a philosophically-minded\nbiologist\u2019s survey of the role of Popper in systematics, see\nGaffney 1979, Rieppel 2008, or Santis 2020.) Regardless,\ncharacterizing parsimony in falsificationist terms provided an\nimportant justification that resonates to this day. More recent\ninvocations of Popper in phylogenetic inference have focused on\nwhether parsimony or model-based methods such as Maximum Likelihood\n (\u00a71.2.3)\n better align with falsificationism (e.g., Siddall & Kluge 1997;\nde Queiroz & Poe 2001, 2003; Kluge 2001), and whether\nprobabilistic and statistical reasoning is relevant for studying\nsingular historical events (Siddall & Kluge 1997; Haber 2005).\n(See Turner 2007; Cleland 2011;Currie 2018, 2019, for general\nphilosophy of historical science.) In\n section 2.4\n we describe how Felsenstein\u2019s (1978) discovery that parsimony\nis prone to systematic errors poses a serious challenge to this\nunderlying falsificationist justification.\n\nParsimony can be defended without falsificationism, and other\njustifications have been offered that appeal to the method\u2019s\nnamesake, i.e., the principle of parsimonious reasoning or appeals to\nOckham\u2019s Razor (e.g., Kluge 2005). It amounts to (i) defending\nparsimony (the principle) as the criterion by which we ought to assess\ncompeting phylogenetic hypotheses, and (ii) arguing that parsimony\n(the method) is the best mode for achieving that goal by seeking out\nthat tree that minimizes the number of evolutionary novelties required\nto explain the distribution of characters. This may also be presented\nas identifying that tree that minimizes the number of ad hoc\nassumptions of homoplasy. Though this appeal to simplicity may be\nwedded to falsificationist justifications (as we saw above), they are\nlogically independent defenses. There is certainly an intuitive appeal\nto the principle of parsimony in the sciences, and Ockham\u2019s\nrazor remains influential for good reason. But justifying parsimony\nmethods by appeal to simplicity is not so straight-forward. Evaluating\nwhich phylogenetic approaches are justified by Ockham\u2019s Razor\ndepends on what is being counted (Haber 2009). Sober (1988b, 2015\namong others) provide useful discussions of the role of simplicity and\nthe principle of parsimony in phylogenetics.\n\nOther philosophical justifications of parsimony have been offered.\nFitzhugh (2008 and elsewhere) has argued that the problem of\nphylogenetic inference is best understood as an abductive problem, and\nthat treating it as a problem for statistical (or inductive) inference\namounts to a category error. Sober (1988b) agrees that phylogenetics\ninvolves abductive reasoning, though argues that this\njustifies the use of statistical approaches (especially\nlikelihood).\n\nIt is also worth recalling why pattern cladists in particular object\nto model-based methods of phylogeny reconstruction. Pattern cladists\ntypically reject any method of phylogeny reconstruction that\nincludes assumptions about the evolutionary process (\u00a71.2.1),\ne.g., Brower (2019: 717) identifies a centrral commitment\ndistinguishing pattern from process (or traditional or phylogenetic)\ncladism as the rejection of \u201ca priori evolutionary\nbackground assumptions from the inference of patterns of relationships\namong taxa.\u201d As such, pattern cladists have strongly objected to\nlikelihood and other model-based phylogenetic methods, as those\nexplicitly incorporate evolutionary models (\u00a71.2.3 and\n\u00a72.4). This has typically gone hand-in-hand with a rejection of\nstatistical approaches more generally, and a commitment to parsimony,\ne.g., \u201cthe statistical approach to phylogenetic inference was\nwrong from the start, for it rests on the idea that to study phylogeny\nat all, one must first know in great detail how evolution has\nproceeded. That cannot very well be the way in which scientific\nknowledge is obtained\u201d (Farris 1983: 17).\n\nIn response, statistical phylogeneticists have argued that parsimony\nmethods implicitly include evolutionary models, which model-based\nmethods simply make explicit and, thus, subject to interrogation (de\nQueiroz & Poe 2001, 2003; Swofford & Sullivan 2009). This\nfault line is further reflected in the way pattern cladists view other\nproponents of parsimony as allies in this debate, as Brower (2019:\n717), approvingly citing Kluge & Farris (1999), makes clear:\n\u201cdespite this difference of opinion regarding critical\nbackground knowledge, there is no practical distinction between\npattern and process cladists\u2019 evidence, analyses or results.\nFrom a methodological perspective, all cladists group by synapomorphy\nalone.\u201d That is, it is in the interpretation of methodology and\ninferential justification that distinctions are drawn between pattern\nand process cladists; in the larger debate with statistical\nphylogeneticists they are allied. Note, however, that ever finer\ndistinctions of the term \u2018cladist\u2019 are being introduced\n(let alone \u2018statistical phylogeneticists\u2019, who typically\nassociate with model-based approaches). This reflects the way this\nterm has grown contested and associated with various competing sets of\ncommitments. It is worth taking a brief detour in section 2.3.1 to\nsort through this a bit.\n2.3.1 Who Owns the Term \u201cCladist\u201d?\n\nIn\n section 1.2.1,\n we used the term \u201ccladistics\u201d to refer to a school of\ntaxonomy which held that higher taxa must be monophyletic, and stood\nin contrast to the competing schools of phenetics/numerical taxonomy\nand evolutionary taxonomy. In this historical context,\n\u201ccladistics\u201d was sometimes used interchangeably with\n\u201cphylogenetics\u201d. We caution against that practice,\nespecially when discussing more contemporary practices. Though it is\nhard to pin down a precise date when these terms began to carry\ndifferent connotations, Felsenstein (1978) and Beatty (1982) are as\ngood a marker as any for when these terms began to diverge and take on\nmore nuanced senses. This is particularly true of the term\n\u201ccladist\u201d, which has become a highly disputed term, and\none that has been claimed by sub-groups within the larger field of\nphylogenetics.\n\nAn apt example of this is the journal Cladistics, whose\neditors published a controversial editorial in 2016 stating that\nsubmitted manuscripts should reflect the philosophical commitments of\nthe journal and its sponsoring professional society (The Willi\nHennig Society) (Editors 2016). They write,\n\n\nThe epistemological paradigm of this journal is parsimony. There are\nstrong philosophical arguments in support of parsimony versus other\nmethods of phylogenetic inference (e.g., Farris 1983).\n\n\nThe editorial continues, stipulating that \u201cPhylogenetic data\nsets submitted to this journal should be analysed using\nparsimony\u201d. If trees generated by alternative methods show\ndifferent results, these may be included if authors prefer those\ntopologies, but only if authors are \u201cprepared to defend it on\nphilosophical grounds\u201d (all quotes from Editors 2016: 1). The\neditors, here, are using the imprimatur of the journal\nCladistics to stake out a specific sense of how\n\u201ccladistics\u201d ought to be understood, and what calling\noneself a \u201cCladist\u201d signals about the underlying\ntheoretical and philosophical commitments held about phylogenetic\ninference, i.e., an exclusive commitment to parsimony\nmethods\u2014going so far as to reject model-based statistical\napproaches entirely.\n\nAleta Quinn (2017) argues that the term \u201ccladist\u201d remains\none claimed by multiple overlapping (yet importantly distinct) camps.\nShe tackles the ambiguity head on, providing a useful \u201cforeign\nlanguage dictionary\u201d of ways that \u201ccladist\u201d gets\nused in systematics. Quinn argues that the term is in need of\ndisambiguation, drawing seven different senses from the literature.\nThis includes systematists that advocate adherence to particular\nphylogenetic methods (e.g., parsimony, as in the case of the\nCladistics editorial) or philosophical justifications\n(especially to a version of Popperian falsificationism), though the\nvarious distinctions of competing senses of \u201ccladist\u201d go\nwell beyond this. In response to Quinn, Williams and Ebach (2018)\npropose an eighth (and their preferred) sense of cladist, and Brower\n(2018a) offers a focused commentary on Quinn\u2019s article, as well\nas other attempts to clarify the philosophical foundations and\ncommitments of pattern cladism. For example, a distinguishing feature\nof pattern cladism is the rejection of a priori assumptions\nabout evolutionary theory in phylogenetic methods. This has been\ninterpreted as a claim of theory-neutrality or minimality by some\nphilosophers and biologists (e.g., Pearson 2010). Brower (2019)\ncontests this interpretation, arguing that the claim of theory\nneutrality is specific to evolutionary assumptions, as opposed to a\nmore general claim.\n\nThe primary take away is that care should be taken when philosophers\nuse the term \u201ccladist\u201d. Though there are a lot of\ninteresting philosophical topics to unpack around this term, it must\nbe acknowledged that it has become ambiguous. There are simply too\nmany senses of this term for it to be used without clearly specifying\nprecisely what sense is being invoked. We encourage philosophers\nwriting about phylogenetics to follow the lead of systematists, and\navoid using the terms \u201ccladist\u201d, \u201ccladistics\u201d,\nand other cognates as synonymous with \u201cphylogenetics\u201d.\nInstead, philosophers should reserve usage of those terms and\ncarefully specify which sub-set of phylogeneticists (or their work)\nthose terms are referring to.\n",
