The Combination Question: How Do Thick Concepts Relate Evaluation and Description?\n\nThe combination question concerns in what way the evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description involved in thick terms and concepts\nrelate. Calling something selfish normally conveys that it is bad, but\nnot just any bad action can qualify as selfish; selfish acts must\ninvolve the agent giving greater priority to some of her own interests\nover others\u2019. (Those interests may be different in different\ncircumstances: one can be emotionally selfish, financially selfish,\nand so on.) Separabilists hold that thick concepts are a combination\nof distinct non-evaluative concepts and other (usually thin)\nevaluative concepts. Philosophers who accept Thin Centralism typically\naccept Separability. And philosophers (often the same ones) who reject\nShapelessness or aim to avoid the anti-disentangling argument also\ntypically accept Separability. But as we\u2019ll see, Separability\ncommits you to neither Thin Centralism nor Shapelessness. While some\nphilosophers writer as if Separabilist views were essentially\nnon-cognitivist (Dancy 1995; Kirchin 2010), cognitivists can well\naccept Separability (Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith 2013). Separabilist\nviews are sometimes called \u201creductive\u201d (Kirchin 2010;\nRoberts 2013a; Harcourt and Thomas 2013). A word of caution about this\nlabel is that Separabilist views needn\u2019t be reductionist in the\nsense of reducing evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones. By\ncontrast, Inseparabilists hold that the meanings of thick terms and\nconcepts are both evaluative and descriptive but cannot be divided\ninto distinct contents; talk of \u201ccombining\u201d evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description is liable to mislead if it suggests putting\ntogether distinct elements (Dancy 1995: 268). Thick concepts are a\ndistinct kind of fundamental evaluative concepts. Accordingly\nInseparabilist Views are often called \u201cnon-reductive\u201d, or\nviews on which thick concepts are \u201cirreducibly thick\u201d.\nPhilosophers who accept Thick Centralism typically accept\nInseparability, and those who accept Inseparability typically accept\nShapelessness and express sympathy for the anti-disentangling\nargument. (As we\u2019ll see, these views needn\u2019t cluster as\nneatly as is sometimes assumed.)\n",
