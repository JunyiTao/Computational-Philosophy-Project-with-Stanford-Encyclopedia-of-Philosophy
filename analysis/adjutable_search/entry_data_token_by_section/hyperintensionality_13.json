    "main_text": "General Approaches to Hyperintensionality || Structured Propositions\n4.6 Algebraic and Object Theory Approaches\n\nA final family of approaches to hyperintensionality to be discussed is\nthe algebraic. Algebraic approaches to semantics typically do not try\nto give an account of meaning in terms of anything else at all.\nInstead, they treat meanings as primitive and focus on the\nrelationships between them to give a semantic theory.\n\nBy defining in a direct way how the meanings of different parts of\nlanguage go together to yield sentence meanings, these approaches are\nnot under pressure to identify the meanings of sentences true in all\nthe same possible circumstances, or even sentences which are logically\nequivalent. So it is easy to see how a general algebraic approach can\nmake room for hyperintensional differences between parts of language.\nEven if sentence meanings are necessarily equivalent, if they relate\ndifferently to a \u201cbelieves that\u201d operator they do not have\nto be substitutable in \u201cJohn believes that \\(A\\)\u201d\ncontexts. Bealer (1979) touts this flexibility as an advantage in\ndealing with puzzles like the semantics of belief attributions, as\ndoes Menzel (1993).\n\nSome algebraic approaches do not take as much advantage of this\nflexibility as one might expect with respect to hyperintensionality\npuzzles. Keenan and Faltz (1984)\u2019s algebraic approach identifies\nnecessary equivalents. Bacon (2018) adopts a Boolean account in which\nthe propositions associated with logical equivalents in predicate\nlogic are identified with each other (e.g., the proposition that\n\\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\) is identical to the proposition that\n\\((A \\land B))\\). This leaves room for distinguishing merely\nnecessarily equivalent propositions, e.g., the proposition that\n\\(2+2=4\\) and the proposition that it rains if and only if it rains.\nBut it does little to help with cases where we want to discriminate\nbetween logical equivalents: if we were to think that \\(A\\) explains\nwhy \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\), or capture the belief content of the confused\nman who believes something of the form \\((A \\land B)\\) but does not\nbelieve \\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\). So it is not the algebraic\napproach per se that yields solutions to particular puzzles\nabout hyperintensionality, but the algebraic approach combined with\ntheoretical choices about the structure of the algebra.\n\nAlgebraic approaches are largely silent on the question of what\nmeanings are, and how meanings come to stand in the relations they do.\n(Or, if every structure of relations between meanings can be found\nsomewhere in Platonic heaven, how we come to be associated with our\nparticular structure rather than others.) Of course, theories which\nsay more about the nature of meanings (e.g., that they are\nset-theoretic constructions from worlds, or they are ordered sets of\nobjects and properties) also face the challenge of explaining\nhow our concrete practices explain which structures of meanings are\nassociated with our speech and writing. So it may be that these\nconcerns are general, and algebraic semantics can employ the same\nkinds of answers to these questions as their rivals.\n\nA close relative of algebraic theories is the object theory of Zalta\n(1988). It also supplies distinct fine-grained meanings to, e.g., be\nthe suitably distinct inputs so that \u201cJohn believes all\ntriangles have internal angles that add up to 180\u00b0\u201d and\n\u201cJohn believes all trilaterals have internal angles that add up\nto 180\u00b0\u201d express different propositions. Zalta says a little\nmore about the identity conditions of his\nhyperintensionally-distinguished properties: according to Zalta,\nproperties are identical if and only if they are encoded by\nthe same objects.\n\nAlgebraic accounts of meaning may have little to say about worldly\nhyperintensionality. There is nothing in the general motivations of\nalgebraic theories that would rule out the hypothesis that we need\nhyperintensional language to best capture the non-representational\naspects of reality, but nor does there appear to be anything in the\ngeneral motivations that would indicate why we would, or how that\nmight manifest in our language. This is not really an objection to\nalgebraic approaches, however. One might think that a theory of\nmeaning should be silent on substantive questions about what\nthe world is like. We do not want our theory of meaning to tell us\nwhich physics or chemical theory to adopt. Likewise, it might be good\nfor a theory of meaning to be neutral about how to understand\nessences, or intrinsicness of properties, or causation. Of course, a\ntheory of meaning may not be able to be completely neutral about\nmetaphysical questions\u2014it should have something to say about\nwhat meanings are, whether there are abstract representations, and so\non\u2014but perhaps algebraic theories not taking a stand on worldly\nhyperintensionality is an attractive feature rather than a\ndrawback.\n",
