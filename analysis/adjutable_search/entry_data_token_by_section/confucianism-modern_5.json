    "main_text": "Knowledge || Moral Knowing and Cognitive Knowing\n3.1 Moral Knowing and Cognitive Knowing\n\nXu Fuguan called this direct awareness embodied recognition\n(tiren \u9ad4\u8a8d), a term employed by Xiong that goes\nback to Wang Yangming. It is a direct, irrefutable feeling, which Xu\nidentifies with the basic moral feelings described by Mengzi. It has\nnothing to do with science:\n\n\nThe development of contemporary science is unable to deny the Chinese\nculture of the heart-mind. This is because the question is not whether\nthis function is located in the\n heart[2]\n or the brain, but rather whether the function described in Chinese\nculture exists in the physiology of humanity. That is, whether there\nare the functions described by Mengzi: the feelings of alarm and\ncompassion, shame and dislike, approval and disapproval, declining and\nyielding, and so on. If this kind of function does not exist in life,\nthen there is nothing more to say. If, on the other hand, we can have\nembodied recognition of the feelings of alarm and compassion, shame\nand dislike, approval and disapproval, declining and yielding, then\nthis proves that there is some part of our body that possesses\nthis function.\n\nIt is just like how some people believe contemporary psychology cannot\nconfirm the activity of the soul described in literature. But if the\nactivity of the soul cannot be confirmed by doing psychology\nexperiments, then this is a problem with psychology\nitself. The key is whether there is this activity of the soul in\npeople\u2019s lives. (Xu 1953 [2022: 168])\n\n\nThe reality of the experienced feeling is enough for Xu. If science\ncannot confirm it or explain it, that is a problem with science, not\nevidence that the feelings are not real.\n\nXu distinguishes the moral nature and the cognitive nature of the\nheart-mind. The moral nature (dexing \u5fb7\u6027) is\nconstituted by the four basic moral responses described by Mengzi. The\ncognitive nature (zhixing \u77e5\u6027) of the heart-mind\nis important, but it belongs to a fundamentally distinct category and\ncannot generate moral responses. The cognitive nature generates\nknowledge of the external world, but accumulating facts cannot by\nitself elicit a moral response (Xu 1963 [1990, 240]). While Xu remains\na realist about value, he agrees that values are a different sort of\nthing than facts about the world. Which is not to say that knowledge\nis not important or should be neglected. Knowledge plays two critical\nroles in Xu\u2019s thought. The first is to \u201cclarify the object\nof morality\u201d; the second is to \u201cprovide rational means for\n[realizing] morality\u201d (Xu 1963 [1990: 287]). The second role is\nthe function of instrumental reason. Greater knowledge of the world\nmeans a better chance of selecting the right means that will lead to\nsuccessful action and not violating one\u2019s good intentions\ninadvertently. The first function is a little murkier as Xu did not\ngive a clear example of what he meant. An illustration might be\nMengzi 1A7, where King Xuan is humane to the ox that he saves\nfrom being sacrificed, but not to his people. The king\u2019s\nhumaneness is misplaced: he is concerned about the ox\u2019s\nsuffering but not about his people\u2019s. It is not that he used the\nwrong means, but that he is mistaken about what merits his compassion.\nKnowledge can rectify this type of misconception. Knowledge is still\ninstrumental, as what has intrinsic value is moral practice, not\nknowledge in itself.\n",
