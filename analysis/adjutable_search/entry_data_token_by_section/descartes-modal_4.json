    "main_text": "Real Distinction\n5. Real Distinction\n\nAny interpretation of Descartes\u2019 views on modality needs to be\nsensitive to his view that mind and body are really distinct. The\nconclusion of his Sixth Meditation argument for substance dualism is\nthat \u201cI am really distinct from my body, and can exist without\nit\u201d (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). A natural reading of Descartes\u2019\nconclusion has him saying that, for any minds and bodies that are\nunited, it is counterfactually possible that they be\n separated.[31]\n His argument would be as follows:\n\nI clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body\napart from mind.\nGod can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly\nperceive.\nGod can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart\nfrom mind.\nIf God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is\napart from mind, then mind and body can exist apart.\nMind and body can exist apart.\n\n\nSuch a reading is sensitive not only to Descartes\u2019 Sixth\nMeditation comments but also to his further remarks on real\ndistinction in Fourth Replies. There Descartes says that for\n\u201cestablishing a real distinction it is sufficient that two\nthings can be understood as \u2018complete\u2019 and that each one\ncan be understood apart from the other\u201d (AT 7:221, CSM 2:156). A\nthing is complete, for Descartes, when it is a substance:\n\n\u2026 [B]y a \u2018complete thing\u2019 I simply mean a substance\nendowed with the forms or attributes which enable me to recognize that\nit is a substance. (AT 7:222, CSM 2:156)\n\n\nSince a Cartesian substance is a thing that is ontologically\nindependent (Principles I.51\u201352), a complete thing is\nan ontologically independent thing. When we clearly and distinctly\nperceive mind and body to be complete, we know that they are\nsubstances. When we still clearly and distinctly perceive them to be\nsubstances after clearly and distinctly perceiving them apart from\neach other, we know that they are not the same substance under\ndifferent descriptions. On this view, Descartes holds that mind and\nbody are ontologically independent substances, and their distinctness\nconsists in their ability to continue to exist even after God\nseparates them (Wilson 1978, 196\u201398).\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Descartes on the real distinction\nbetween mind and body reads the distinction as consisting in the fact\nthat they are non-identical substances, but not in the fact of their\nseparability (Rozemond 1998, 28\u201337). Descartes holds that a\nsufficient condition for establishing a real distinction between two\nthings is clearly and distinctly perceiving them to be non-identical\nsubstances (\u201cSynopsis of these following six Meditations,\u201d\nAT 7:13, CSM 2:9; Fourth Replies, AT 7:221\u2013223, CSM\n2:156\u201358). If so, he holds that the substantiality of two\nnon-identical substances does not consist in their being separable,\neven though in fact they are separable (Rozemond 1998, 3\u20138). On\nthis view, mind and body are separable for Descartes; it\u2019s just\nthat their separability is a consequence of the (different) fact that\nthey are really distinct (Rozemond 1998, 28\u201337).\n\nA third reading of the Cartesian real distinction stresses the\ndifficulty in making room for unactualized possibilities in\nDescartes\u2019 system. The reading also highlights that Descartes\nholds that our clear and distinct perceptions are veridical but says\n(in his proof of real distinction) that God can bring about\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive. Descartes is clear in\nother texts that the reason why he mentions God\u2019s power in the\nproof of real distinction is to remind us that no matter how unlikely\nwe think it is that our intimately united minds and bodies could also\nbe really distinct, God has enough power to have made all of\nour clear and distinct perceptions veridical:\n\nYou agree that thought is an attribute of a substance which contains\nno extension, and conversely that extension is an attribute of a\nsubstance that contains no thought. So you must also agree that a\nthinking substance is distinct from an extended substance. For the\nonly criterion we have enabling us to know that one substance differs\nfrom another is that we understand one apart from the other. And God\ncan surely bring about whatever we can clearly understand; the only\nthings that are said to be impossible for God to do are those which\ninvolve a conceptual contradiction, that is, which are not\nintelligible. But we can clearly understand a thinking substance that\nis not extended, and an extended substance that does not think, as you\n agree.[32]\n\n\nIn Fourth Replies Descartes say that his reason for\nmentioning God\u2019s power in the Sixth Meditation proof of real\ndistinction is to remind his reader that our clear and distinct\nperceptions are veridical (AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). In the Sixth\nMeditation itself he arrives at a clear and distinct perception of\nmind as an immaterial substance and body as a material non-thinking\nsubstance and is immediately struck by the union of his mind and body:\n\u201cIt is true that I may have\u2026 a body that is very closely\njoined to me\u201d (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). He says that\n\u201cnevertheless\u201d his mind and body are really distinct.\nDescartes appreciates that the facts of mind-body union and mind-body\nseparation are\n opposed.[33]\n In the context of demonstrating the real distinction between mind and\nbody he reminds us that God\u2019s power is such that there can be\ncreatures that have nothing in common but that are intimately\n united.[34]\n\nIf we take seriously the consideration that there is no room in\nDescartes\u2019 ontology for unactualized possibilities, the real\ndistinction between mind and body does not amount to their\ncounterfactual\n separation.[35]\n God has willed the series of creatures from eternity, and the claim\nthat mind and body can exist apart might amount to the claim that when\na given mind and body are separated in the series, each is\nontologically independent and so continues to\n exist.[36]\n That is, instead of reflecting that there is anything more in\nDescartes\u2019 ontology than what is contained in the series that\nGod wills and preordains, the claim that mind and body can exist apart\nmight amount to Descartes\u2019 note in \u201cSynopsis of these\nfollowing six Meditations\u201d that in the Sixth Meditation he is\nattempting to re-assure us that \u201cthe decay of the body does not\nimply the destruction of them mind\u201d (AT 7:13, CSM 1:10). Or as\nhe puts it elsewhere, he is attempting to \u201cprove the\nexistence\u2026 of our souls when they are separate from\nthe body\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 25 November 1630,\u201d AT\n1:182, CSMK 29, emphasis added). If so, the claim that mind and body\ncan exist apart does not posit the existence of possible reality any\nmore than the Principles III.47 claim that it is possible\n(over time) for bodies to exhibit all the configurations of which they\nare capable (AT 8A:103, CSM 1:258).\n\nIf Descartes holds that potential being is strictly speaking nothing,\nand if his ontology and his commitment to divine immutability, divine\npreordination, and (his particular conception of) omnipotence bar\npossibilities from his system, it is not exactly clear what to make of\nthe possibility of mind and body existing in separation. One view is\nthat Descartes is committed to the reality of this possibility and\nthat, with his commitment to other possibilities, this commitment is\npart of a pattern of Descartes\u2019 helping himself to entities that\nhis system does not allow. That is, it might be the case that\nDescartes wants his system to be rich enough to posit possibilities\nand that, when it isn\u2019t, he posits them anyway. Or, it might be\nthe case that because the Meditations does not attempt to\nanalyze (and then refine) the meditator\u2019s\npre-Meditations view of modality, the \u2018can\u2019 in\nDescartes\u2019 claim that mind and body can exist apart is the not\nfully analyzed \u2018can\u2019 of the\n vernacular.[37]\n",
