A stock\nexample: from the premise, \u201cFat Devadatta does not eat during\nthe day\u201d (known by perception and/or testimony), the conclusion\nis known (by arth\u0101patti), \u201cHe eats at\nnight.\u201d For Ny\u0101ya, the inference (which is no special\nsource) can be reconstructed where F = \u201cis fat but does not eat\nduring the day\u201d and G = \u201ceats at night\u201d: Whoso F,\nthat person G; what is not so (F) is not so (G), like Maitra (who eats\nduring the day and not at night). This would be a\n\u201cnegative-only\u201d inference so long as not only has\nDevadatta not been observed to eat at night but also there is no one\nelse known to be like him in being fat and having been observed to eat\nonly at night. We do know that he eats at night (though this has not\nbeen observed), and our inductive base is comprised only of negative\ncorrelations. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 rejects this analysis and\nholds in contrast that presumption is an independent\nknowledge source and an important one, operative in basic language\ncomprehension as well as in knowledge of various everyday facts. The\nreasoning is not inferential because no pervasion is known, it is\ncommonly argued.\n",
