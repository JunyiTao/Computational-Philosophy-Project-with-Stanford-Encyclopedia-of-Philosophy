    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s philosophy, especially the positive project of his\n\u201cscience of man\u201d, is often thought to be modeled on\nNewton\u2019s successes in natural philosophy. Hume\u2019s\nself-described \u201cexperimental method\u201d (see the subtitle to\nTreatise) and the resemblance of his \u201crules of\nreasoning\u201d (THN\n 1.3.15)[1]\n with Newton\u2019s are said to be evidence for this position (Noxon\n1973; Stroud 1977; de Pierris 2002; Penelhum 2000; Bennett 2001;\nBeebee 2006; Hazony 2014; Demeter 2016 etc.). Hume encourages this\nview of his project by employing Newtonian metaphors: he talks of an\n\u201cattraction\u201d in the \u201cmental world\u201d on a par\nwith that in the \u201cnatural world\u201d (THN 1.1.4.6). Hume\ninfers the existence of \u201chabits\u201d as a kind of mental\n\u201cforce\u201d (EHU 5.22) analogous to gravity; the discovery of\nthe \u201cthe principles of association\u201d, which in the Abstract\nhe calls his most important achievement (see the\n section on association in the entry on Hume),\n are, then, analogous to the laws of motion. Hume certainly appears to\nwant his readers to feel that he is modeling his project on the\nsuccesses of natural philosophy, exemplified by Newton. In the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Treatise and even more\nexplicitly in the opening pages of Enquiry (EHU 1.15), Hume\nsuggests that his \u201cscience of man\u201d can parallel recent\nachievements in natural philosophy (with rather obvious nods to\nNewton\u2019s successes in planetary astronomy). And at the start of\nEPM (1.10), he echoes Newton\u2019s rejection of\n\u201chypotheses\u201d, and restates his allegiance to the\nexperimental method in contrast with its speculative alternative (on\nthe contrast see Anstey 2005). There is, thus, no doubt that Hume\nwants his readers to believe that Newton forms a kind of model.\n\nYet, in the totality of Hume\u2019s oeuvre the technical details of\nNewton\u2019s philosophy are rarely discussed explicitly. In fact,\nsome of the most sophisticated analyses of the implications of\nNewton\u2019s philosophy are attributed to Cleanthes, the\nspokesperson for the inductive argument from design in the\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Dialogues).\nWhile in recent years many commentators have come to doubt that Philo\nshould be considered a straightforward spokesperson of Hume\u2019s\nviews, few suggest that Hume endorses without qualification\nCleanthes\u2019s Newtonian argument from design\u2014the foundations\nof which are undermined throughout Hume\u2019s writings (e.g., Harris\n2015: 447ff). But this raises further complications because Hume can\nbe read as implying that criticism of the design argument can be\ngenerated on strictly Newtonian methodological grounds: the authority\nof \u201cexperience\u201d\u2014to which Hume and Newton both\nappeal\u2014does not license an inference (supported by analogical\nreasoning) to a God-like designer of the universe. This would make\nHume something of an internal critic of Newtonianism (Hurlbutt 1985).\nThe same strategy\u2014generate internal criticism to Newtonian\nnatural philosophy\u2014may be thought to operate in Hume\u2019s\nEmpiricist attack on the putative meaningfulness of invisible or\ntheoretical entities (e.g., forces, powers, and masses) that made him\na favorite of Logical Positivists early in the twentieth century (see\nthe entry on\n Alfred Jules Ayer).\n This Positivist interpretation seemed to go well with Hume\u2019s\nreputation for skepticism. Yet, as Positivism gave way to Naturalism\nas the dominant force in twentieth century Anglophone philosophy,\nscholarship on Hume has increasingly emphasized the naturalistic\nelements in Hume, while reinterpreting, even downplaying, his\nskeptical tendencies (Kemp Smith, 1941; Stroud 1977; Garrett 1997).\nBut if by naturalism one (also) means that one is willing to accept\nthe authority of science (see the section on\n Naturalism and Holism in the entry on indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics)\n then one runs into a problem: it is by no means clear that Hume\naccepts the independent intellectual authority of natural philosophers\n(including Newton) to have the final word in interpreting\nNewton\u2019s achievements.\n\nBefore, turning to discussion of Hume\u2019s relationship to Newton\nand Newtonianism, one ought to emphasize three problems that beset the\nscholarly literature on this topic. First, much scholarship on Hume is\nstill surprisingly ahistorical; especially among philosophers, it\ntends to favor rational reconstruction of arguments over attention to\nmore contextual forms of interpretation. If such philosophers pay\nattention to historical figures, these tend to be other canonical\nphilosophers: Descartes, Locke, Malebranche, and Berkeley. Second,\neven scholars that emphasize the historical Hume (e.g., Wright 1983;\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997; Winkler 2000) do not tend to exhibit a\nworking knowledge of the details of Newton\u2019s natural philosophy\n(but see Demeter 2016; Slavov 2016; Biener & Schliesser 2014; Belkind 2019). Nearly all of\nthe literature in this genre, most of it quite careful, compares the\ndetails of Hume\u2019s philosophy to evidence from various text-books\n(often \u201cNewtonian\u201d) potentially available to Hume.\nFinally, even the most careful and insightful scholarship on Hume\ntends to ignore the recent scholarly literature generated by the\nrenewed philosophic and historical interest in Newton\u2019s\nphilosophy (Cohen & Smith 2002; see also\n entry on Newton\u2019s philosophy).\n",
