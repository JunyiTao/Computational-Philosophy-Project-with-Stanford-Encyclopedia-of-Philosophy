    "main_text": "Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology || The Identity of the Divine Attributes\n3.3 The Identity of the Divine Attributes\n\nThe foregoing may explain how it is conceivable without obvious\nincoherence that God and his nature and God and his existence be\nidentical, but how does it answer the second question? How does it\nexplain the conceivability without obvious incoherence of the identity\nof the divine attributes with each other? If each attribute is\nidentical to God, then each attribute is identical to each other by\nthe Transitivity of Identity. For example, if God = omniscience, and\nGod = omnipotence, then omniscience = omnipotence. But how could each\nattribute be identical to God? If we can understand how each attribute\ncan be identical to God, then we can understand how every attribute\ncan be identical to every other one.\n\nWe have already seen how, if we embrace a constituent approach to\nontology, the divine nature can be coherently conceived as identical\nto God. Being immaterial, there is nothing in God to distinguish him\nfrom his nature. So he is identical to his nature. The divine nature\nis, or can be thought of as, a property. So there is at least one\nproperty that is self-instantiating: it has itself as its sole\ninstance, and indeed as its sole possible instance. If this is\ncoherently conceivable, then the same will be true of perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, and so on: if instantiated, these attributes\nare self-instantiated in every possible world and by the same thing in\nevery possible world (Vallicella 1992). Thus not only is the divine\nnature identical to an individual, each divine perfection is identical\nto an individual, namely God, whence it follows that each perfection\nis identical to every other one.\n\nA structurally similar approach is suggested by Christopher Hughes.\nThink of first-level properties as David Lewis (1986, 50 ff.) does: as\nsets of actual and possible individuals. Then the property of being\nred will be the set of all actual and possible red individuals and the\nproperty of being perfectly powerful will be the set consisting of all\nactual and possible perfectly powerful individuals. But there is only\none such individual, God. Only God is perfectly powerful and only God\ncan be perfectly powerful. So perfect power = {God}. As Hughes (1989,\n65) notes, Quine holds that a singleton and its member are identical.\nIf so, then perfect power = {God} = God. It should be added that if we\nhave already abandoned nonconstituent ontology with its rigid\nbifurcation of the concrete and the abstract according to which the\ntwo realms are disjoint, then we no longer have a reason to argue that\na concrete individual and its singleton must be distinct on the ground\nthat the former is concrete while the latter is abstract. Constituent\nontology allows for a sort of \u2018coalescence\u2019 of the\nconcrete and the abstract, the particular and the universal. Indeed,\nsuch a coalescence is what we find in the simple God who is in some\nsense both concrete and abstract in that he is a nature that is its\nown suppositum.\n\nThus there appears to be justification for the move from perfect power\n= {God} to perfect power = God. And similarly for perfect knowledge,\netc. In this way one can render coherent the notion that the\nperfections constitutive of the divine nature are identical with one\nanother. For if each is identical to God, then each is identical to\nevery other one.\n",
