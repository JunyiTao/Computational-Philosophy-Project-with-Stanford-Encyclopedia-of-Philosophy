Other structuralisms\n\nThe term \u2018structuralism\u2019 is used with different meanings\nand therefore it seems appropriate to mention other\n\u2018structuralisms\u2019 and to explain how \u2018structuralism\nin physics\u2019 is related to them. If you check the entry \u2018structuralism (disambiguation)\u2019 in Wikipedia,\nyou will be informed that there is a spectrum of\n\u2018structuralisms\u2019 in 11 different areas, including:\n\nlinguistics [F. de Saussure (1857\u20131913)],\nanthropology [C. L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1908\u20132009)],\nmathematics [N. Bourbaki (1935\u2013), collective\npseudonym],\nphilosophy of science [J. D. Sneed (1938\u2013), W.\nStegm\u00fcller (1923\u20131991)].\n\n\nHere we have mentioned some prominent representatives in brackets. All\ntypes of structuralism share a common conviction about the r\u00f4le\nof structures in their respective disciplines, but at first glance\nthey show little similarity. Nevertheless, there are connections and\nmutual influences between the different structuralisms. It goes beyond\nthe scope of this entry to examine these influences in more detail.\nFor the relations between anthropologic and mathematical structuralism\nsee Aubin (1997). As mentioned, we will understand\n\u2018structuralism in physics\u2019 as a special case of\n\u2018structuralism in philosophy of science\u2019. There are close\nconnections with mathematical structuralism, which we will discuss in\nmore detail in the main part of this entry. To illustrate these\nconnections here we only mention the full title of Stegm\u00fcller\n(1979a): The structuralist view of theories, A possible analogue of\nthe Bourbaki programme in physical science.\n\nRight now, we are taking the interim balance that \u2018Structuralism\nin Physics\u2019 is part of an intellectual movement mainly in the\n20th century and, compared to other structuralisms, represents a\nrather late contribution.\n2. Common traits\n\nThe three programs mentioned in the preamble share the following\ncharacteristics and convictions:\n\nA metatheory of science requires a kind of formalization different\nfrom that already employed by scientific theories themselves.\nThe structuralistic program yields a framework for the rational\nreconstruction of particular theories.\nA central tool of formalization is Bourbaki\u2019s concept of\n\u201cspecies of structures\u201d, as described in Bourbaki\n(1986).\nAmong the significant features of theories to be described are:\n\n\nMathematical structure\nEmpirical claims of a theory\nFunction of theoretical terms\nR\u00f4le of approximation\nEvolution of theories\nIntertheoretic relations\n \n\n3. The problem of theoretical terms\n\nA physical theory \\(T\\) consists, among other things, of a group of\nlaws which are formulated in terms of certain concepts. But an\napparent circularity arises when one considers how the laws of \\(T\\)\nand the concepts acquire their content, because each seems to acquire\ncontent from the other \u2014 the laws of \\(T\\) acquire their content\nfrom the concepts used in the formulation of the laws, while the\nconcepts are often \u201cintroduced\u201d or \u201cdefined\u201d\nby the group of laws as a whole. To be sure, if the concepts can be\nintroduced independently of the theory \\(T\\), the circularity does not\nappear. But typically every physical theory \\(T\\) requires some new\nconcepts which cannot be defined without using \\(T\\) (we call the\nlatter \u201c\\(T\\)-theoretical concepts\u201d). Is the apparent\ncircularity concerning the laws and the T-theoretical concepts a\nproblem? Some examples will help us assess the threat.\n3.1 An example\n\nAs an example, consider the theory \\(T\\) of classical particle\nmechanics. For simplicity we will assume that kinematical concepts,\nsuch as the positions of particles, their velocities and accelerations\nare given independently of the theory as functions of time. A central\nstatement of \\(T\\) is Newton\u2019s second law, \\(\\bF= m\\ba\\), which\nasserts that the sum \\(\\bF\\) of the forces exerted upon a particle\nequals its mass \\(m\\) multiplied by its acceleration \\(\\ba\\).\n\nWhile we customarily think of \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\) as an empirical assertion,\nthere is a real risk that it turns out merely to be a definition or\nlargely conventional in character. If we think of a force merely as\n\u201cthat which generates acceleration\u201d then the force \\(\\bF\\)\nis actually defined by the equation \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\). We have a particle\nundergoing some given acceleration \\(\\ba\\), then \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\) just\ndefines what \\(\\bF\\) is. The law is not an empirically testable\nassertation at all, since a force so defined cannot fail to satisfy\n\\(\\bF=m\\ba\\). The problem gets worse if we define the (inertial) mass\n\\(m\\) in the usual manner as the ratio \\(|\\bF|/|\\ba\\)|. For now we are\nusing the one equation \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\) to define two quantities \\(\\bF\\)\nand \\(m\\). A given acceleration \\(\\ba\\) at best specifies the ratio\n\\(\\bF/m\\) but does not specify unique values for \\(\\bF\\) and \\(m\\)\nindividually.\n\nIn more formal terms, the problem arises because we introduced force\n\\(\\bF\\) and mass \\(m\\) as \\(T\\)-theoretical terms that are not given\nby other theories. That fact also supplies an escape from the problem.\nWe can add extra laws to the simple dynamics. For example, we might\nrequire that all forces are gravitational and that the net force on\nthe mass \\(m\\) be given by the sum \\(\\bF=\\Sigma_i \\bF_i\\) of all\ngravitational forces \\(\\bF_i\\) acting on the mass due to the other\nmasses of the universe, in accord with Newton\u2019s inverse square\nlaw of gravity. (The law asserts that the force \\(\\bF_i\\) due to\nattracting mass \\(i\\) with gravitational mass \\(m_{gi}\\) is \\(Gm_g\nm_{gi} \\boldsymbol{r}_i / r_{i}^3\\), where \\(m_g\\) is the\ngravitational mass of the original body, \\(\\boldsymbol{r}_i\\) the\nposition vector of mass \\(i\\) originating from the original body, and\n\\(G\\) the universal constant of gravitation.) That gives us an\nindependent definition for \\(\\bF\\). Similarly we can require that the\ninertial mass \\(m\\) be equal to the gravitational mass \\(m_g\\). Since\nwe now have independent access to each of the terms \\(\\bF\\), \\(m\\) and\n\\(\\ba\\) appearing in \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\), whether the law obtains is\ncontingent and no longer a matter of definition.\n\nFurther problems can arise, however, because of another\n\\(T\\)-theoretical term that is invoked implicitly when \\(\\bF=m\\ba\\) is\nasserted. The accelerations \\(\\ba\\) are tacitly assumed to be measured\nin relation to an inertial system. If the acceleration is measured in\nrelation to a different reference system, a different result is\nobtained. For example, if it is measured in relation to a system\nmoving with uniform acceleration \\(\\ba\\), then the measured\nacceleration will be \\(\\ba' = (\\ba - \\ba)\\). A body not acted on by\ngravitational forces in an inertial frame will obey \\(0=m\\ba\\) so that\n\\(\\ba=0\\). The same body in the accelerated frame will have\nacceleration \\(\\ba' = -\\ba\\) and be governed by \\(-m\\ba = m\\ba'\\). The\nproblem is that the term \\(-m\\ba\\) behaves just like a gravitational\nforce; its magnitude is directly proportional to the mass \\(m\\) of the\nbody. So the case of a gravitation free body in a uniformly\naccelerated reference system is indistinguishable from a body in free\nfall in a homogeneous gravitational field. A theoretical\nunderdetermination threatens once again. Given just the motions how\nare we to know which case is presented to\n us?[1]\n Resolving these problems requires a systematic study of the relations\nbetween the various \\(T\\)-theoretical concepts, inertial mass,\ngravitational mass, inertial force, gravitational force, inertial\nsystems and accelerated systems and how they figure in the relevant\nlaws of the theory \\(T\\).\n\nSimilar problems arise in the formulation of almost all fundamental\nphysical theories.\n3.2 Structuralistic solutions of the problem of theoretical terms\n\nThere are various ways to cope with this problem. One could try to\nunmask it as a pseudo-problem. Or one could try to accept the problem\nas part of the usual way science works, albeit not in the clean manner\nphilosophers would like it. The structuralistic programs, however,\nagree that this is a non-trivial problem to be solved and devise\nmeta-theoretical machinery to enable its solution. They further agree\non dividing the vocabulary of the theory \\(T\\) into \\(T\\)-theoretical\nand \\(T\\)-non-theoretical terms, the latter being provided from\noutside the theory.\n3.2.1 Sneed\u2019s solution\n\nIn the Sneedean approach the \u201cempirical claim\u201d of the\ntheory is formulated by using an existential quantifier for the\n\\(T\\)-theoretical terms (i.e., in terms of the \u201cRamsey\nsentence\u201d for \\(T)\\). In our above example, Newton\u2019s law\nfor gravitational forces would be reformulated as: \u201cThere exist\nan inertial system and constants \\(G, m_i, m_{gi}\\) such that for each\nparticle the product of its mass times its acceleration equals the sum\nof the gravitational forces as given above.\u201d This removes the\ncircularity but leaves open the question of content. Here the\nstructuralists \u00e0 la Sneed would argue that the empirical claim\nof the theory \\(T'\\) has to contain all the laws of the theory as well\nas higher-order laws, called \u201cconstraints\u201d. In our\nexample, the constraints would be statements such as \u201call\nparticles have the same inertial and gravitational masses and the\ngravitational constant assumes the same value in all models of the\ntheory.\u201d The theory would thereby acquire more content and\nbecome non-vacuous.\n3.2.2 Ludwig\u2019s solution\n\nAlthough Ludwig\u2019s meta-theoretical framework is slightly\ndifferent, the first part of his solution is essentially equivalent to\nthe above one. On the other hand, he proposes a stronger program\n(\u201caxiomatic basis of a physical theory\u201d) which proceeds by\nconsidering an equivalent form \\(T\\)* of a theory \\(T\\) in which all\n\\(T\\)-theoretical concepts are eliminated by explicit definitions.\nThis seems to be at variance with older results about the\nnon-definability of theoretical terms, but a closer inspection removes\nthe apparent contradiction. For example, the concept of\n\u201cmass\u201d may be non-definable in a theory dealing only with\nsingle orbits of a mechanical system, but definable in a theory\ncontaining all possible orbits of that system.\n\nHowever, to formulate the axiomatic basis of a real theory, not just a\ntoy model, is a non-trivial task and typically requires one or two\nbooks; see the examples Ludwig (1985, 1987) and Schmidt (1979).\n3.3 The measurement problem\n\nBoth programs address the further problem of how to determine the\nextension, e.g., the numerical values, of a theoretical term from a\ngiven set of observational data. We will call this the\n\u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, not to be confounded with the\nwell-known measurement problem in quantum theory. Typically the\nmeasurement problem has no unique solution. Rather the values of the\ntheoretical quantities can only be measured within a certain degree of\nimprecision and using auxiliary assumptions which, although plausible,\nare not confirmed with certainty. In the above Newton example one\nwould have to use the auxiliary assumption that the trajectories of\nthe particles are twice differentiable and that other forces except\nthe gravitational forces can be neglected. For a recent critical\nexamination of the solution to the measurement problem within\nSneed\u2019s approach with detailed examples from astronomy see\nG\u00e4hde (2014).\n3.4 Measurement and approximation\n\nThe feature of imprecision and approximation plays a prominent\nr\u00f4le in the structuralistic programs. In the context of the\nmeasurement problem, imprecision seems to be a defect of the theory\nwhich impedes the exact determination of the theoretical quantities.\nHowever, imprecision and non-uniqueness is crucial in the context of\nevolution of theories and the transition to new and\n\u201cbetter\u201d theories. Otherwise the new theory could in\ngeneral not encompass the successful applications of the old theory.\nConsider for example the transition of Kepler\u2019s theory of\nplanetary motion to Newton\u2019s and Einstein\u2019s theories:\nNewtonian gravitation theory and general relativity replace the Kepler\nellipses with more complicated curves. But these should still be\nconsistent with the old astronomical observations, which is only\npossible if they don\u2019t fit exactly into Kepler\u2019s theory\n.\n4. Problems of reduction\n4.1 Reduction relation between theories\n\nPart of the structuralistic program is the definition of various\nintertheoretic relations. Here we will concentrate on the relation(s)\nof \u201creduction\u201d, which play an important r\u00f4le in the\nphilosophical discourse as well as in the work of the physicists,\nalbeit not under this name. Consider a theory \\(T\\) which is\nsuperseded by a better theory \\(T'\\). One could use \\(T'\\) in order to\nunderstand some of the successes and failures of \\(T\\). If there is\nsome systematic way of deriving \\(T\\) as an approximation within\n\\(T'\\), then \\(T\\) is \u201creduced\u201d to or by \\(T'\\). In this\ncase, \\(T\\) is successful where it is a good approximation to \\(T'\\)\nand \\(T'\\) is successful. On the other hand, in situations where\n\\(T'\\) is still successful but \\(T\\) is a poor approximation to\n\\(T'\\), \\(T\\) will fail. For example, classical mechanics should be\nobtained as the limiting case of relativistic mechanics for velocities\nsmall compared with the velocity of light. This would explain why\nclassical mechanics was, and is still, successfully applied in the\ncase of small velocities but fails for large (relative)\nvelocities.\n\nAs mentioned, the investigation of such reduction relations between\ndifferent theories is part of the every-day work of theoretical\nphysicists, but usually they do not adopt a general concept of\nreduction. Rather they intuitively decide what has to be shown or to\nbe calculated, depending on the case under consideration. Here the\nwork of the structuralists could lead to a more systematic approach\nwithin physics, although there does not yet exist a generally\naccepted, unique concept of reduction.\n4.2 Reduction and incommensurability\n\nAnother aspect is the r\u00f4le of reduction within the global\npicture of the development of physics. Most physicists, but not all,\ntend to view their science as an enterprise which accumulates\nknowledge in a continuous manner. For example, they would not say that\nclassical mechanics has been disproved by relativistic mechanics, but\nthat relativistic mechanics has partly clarified where classical\nmechanics could be safely applied and where not. This view of the\ndevelopment of physics has been challenged by some philosophers and\nhistorians of science, especially by the writings of T. Kuhn and P.\nFeyerabend. These scholars emphasize the conceptual discontinuity or\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d between reduced theory \\(T\\) and\nreducing theory \\(T'\\). The structuralistic accounts of reduction now\nopens the possibility of discussing these matters on a less informal\nlevel. The preliminary results of this discussion are different\ndepending on the particular program.\n4.3 Ludwig\u2019s account\n\nIn the writings of Ludwig there is no direct reference to the\nincommensurability thesis and the corresponding discussion. But\nobviously his approach implies the most radical denial of this thesis.\nHis reduction relation is composed of two simpler intertheoretic\nrelations called \u201crestriction\u201d and\n\u201cembedding\u201d. They come in two versions, exact and\napproximate. Part of their definitions are detailed rules of\ntranslation of the non-theoretic vocabulary of \\(T'\\) into that of\n\\(T\\). Hence commensurability, at least on the non-theoretical level,\nis insured by definition. The problem is then shifted to the task of\nshowing that some of the interesting cases of reduction, which are\ndiscussed in the context of incommensurability, fit into\nLudwig\u2019s definition. Unfortunately, he gives only one\nextensively worked-out example of reduction, namely thermodynamics vs.\nquantum statistical mechanics, in Ludwig (1987). Incommensurability of\ntheoretical terms could probably be more easily incorporated in\nLudwig\u2019s approach since it could be traced back to the\ndifference between the laws of \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\).\n4.4 Sneed\u2019s account\n\nThe relation between incommensurability and the Sneedean reduction\nrelation is to some extent discussed in Balzer et al. (1987,\nchapter VI.7). The authors consider an exact reduction relation as a\ncertain relation between potential models of the respective theories.\nMore interesting for physical real-life examples is the approximate\nversion which is obtained as a \u201cblurred exact reduction\u201d\nby means of a subclass of an empirical uniformity on the classes of\npotential models. The Kepler-Newton case is discussed as an example of\napproximate reduction. The discussion of incommensurability suffers\nfrom the notorious difficulties of explicating such notions as\n\u201cmeaning preserving translation\u201d. There is an interesting\napplication of the interpolation theorem of meta-mathematics which\nyields the result that, roughly speaking, (exact) reduction implies\ntranslation. However, the relevance of this result is questioned in\nBalzer et al. (1987, 312 ff). Thus the discussion eventually\nends up as inconclusive, but the authors admit the possibility of a\nspectrum of incommensurabilities of different degrees in cases of\npairs of reduced/reducing theories.\n4.5 Scheibe\u2019s account\n\nScheibe in his (1999) also explicitly refers to the theses of Kuhn and\nFeyerabend and gives a detailed discussion. Unlike the other two\nstructuralistic programs, he does not propose a fixed concept of\nreduction. Rather he suggests a lot of special reduction relations\nwhich can be combined appropriately to connect two theories \\(T\\) and\n\\(T'\\). Moreover, he proceeds by means of extensive real-life case\nstudies and considers new types of reduction relations if the case\nunder consideration cannot be described by the relations considered so\nfar. Scheibe concedes that there are instances of incommensurability\nwhich make it difficult to find a reduction relation in certain cases.\nAs a significant example he mentions the notions of an\n\u201cobservable\u201d in quantum mechanics on the one hand, and in\nclassical statistical mechanics on the other hand. Although there are\nmaps between the respective sets of observables, Scheibe considers\nthis as a case of incommensurability, since these maps are not Lie\nalgebra homomorphisms, see Scheibe (1999, 174).\n\nSummarizing, the structuralistic approaches are capable of discussing\nthe issues of reduction and incommensurability and the underlying\nproblems on an advanced level. Thereby these approaches have a chance\nof mediating between disparate camps of physicists and\nphilosophers.\n5. Three structuralist programs\n\nIn this section we will describe more closely the particular programs,\ntheir roots and some of the differences between them.\n5.1 Sneed\u2019s program\n5.1.1 History and general traits\n\nThis program has been the most successful with respect to the\nformation of a \u201cschool\u201d attracting scholars and students\nwho adopt the approach and work on its specific problems. Hence most\nof the structuralistic literature concerns the Sneedean variant.\nPerhaps this is partly also due to the circumstance that only\nSneed\u2019s approach is intended to apply (and has been applied) to\nother sciences and not only physics.\n\nA more comprehensive account of the historical roots of structuralism\nin philosophy of science can be found in Bolinger (2016), although\nthis book is not yet translated into English. The seminal book was\nSneed (1971) which presented a meta-theory of physics in the\nmodel-theoretical tradition connected with P. Suppes, B. C. van\nFraassen, and F. Suppe. This approach was adopted and popularized by\nthe German philosopher W. Stegm\u00fcller (1923\u20131991), see e.g.,\nStegm\u00fcller (1979b) and further developed mainly by his disciples.\nIn its early days the approach was called the \u201cnon-statement\nview\u201d of theories, emphasizing the r\u00f4le of set-theoretical\ntools as opposed to linguistic analyses. Later this aspect was\nconsidered to be more of practical importance than a matter of\nprinciple, see Balzer et al. (1987, 306 ff). Recently, H.\nAndreas (2014) and G. Schurz (2014) have proposed two slightly\ndifferent frameworks that reconcile semantical and syntactical\nformulations of Sneed\u2019s program. Nevertheless, the almost\nexclusive use of set-theoretic tools remains one of the characteristic\nstylistic features of this program and one that distinguishes it\nconspicuously from the other programs.\n5.1.2 Central notions of Sneed\u2019s program\n\nAccording to Moulines, in Balzer and Moulines (1996, 12\u201313), the\nspecific notions of the Sneedean program are the following. We\nillustrate these notions by simplified examples, inspired by Balzer\net al. (1987), which are based on a system of \\(N\\) classical\npoint particles coupled by springs satisfying Hooke\u2019s law. For a\nrecent introduction into the basic concepts see also H.

In Ludwig\n(1970, 1985, 1987), he published an axiomatic account of quantum\nmechanics, which was based on the statistical interpretation of\nquantum theory. As a prerequisite for this work he found it necessary\nto ask \u201cWhat is a physical theory?\u201d and developed a\ngeneral concept of a theory on the first 80 pages of his (1970). Later\nthis general theory was expanded into the book Ludwig (1978). A recent\nelaboration of Ludwig\u2019s program can be found in Schr\u00f6ter\n(1996).\n\nHis underlying \u201cphilosophy\u201d is the view that there are\nreal structures in the world which are \u201cpictured\u201d or\nrepresented, in an approximate fashion, by mathematical structures,\nsymbolically \\(\\boldsymbol{PT} = \\boldsymbol{W} (-) \\boldsymbol{MT}\\).\nThe mathematical theory \\(\\boldsymbol{MT}\\) used in a physical theory\n\\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\) contains as its core a \u201cspecies of\nstructure\u201d \\(\\Sigma\\). This is a meta-mathematical concept of\nBourbaki which Ludwig introduced into the structuralistic approach.\nThe contact between \\(\\boldsymbol{MT}\\) to some \u201cdomain of\nreality\u201d \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\) is achieved by a set of\ncorrespondence principles \\((-)\\), which give rules for translating\nphysical facts into certain mathematical statements called\n\u201cobservational reports\u201d. These facts are either directly\nobservable or given by means of other physical theories, called\n\u201cpre-theories\u201d of \\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\). In this way a part\n\\(\\boldsymbol{G}\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\), called \u201cbasic\ndomain\u201d is constructed. But it remains a task of the theory to\nconstruct the full domain of reality \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\), that is, the\nmore complete description of the basic domain that also uses\n\\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\)-theoretical terms.\n5.2.2 Typical features of Ludwig\u2019s program\n\nSuperficially considered, this concept of theory shows some similarity\nto neo-positivistic ideas and would be subject to similar criticism.\nFor example, the discussion of the so-called\n\u2018theory-laden\u2019 character of observation sentences casts\ndoubts on such notions as \u201cdirectly observable facts\u201d.\nNevertheless, the adherents of the Ludwig approach would probably\nargue for a moderate form of observationalism and would point out\nthat, within Ludwig\u2019s approach, the theory-laden character of\nobservation sentences could be analyzed in detail.\n\nAnother central idea of Ludwig\u2019s program is the description of\nintra- and inter-theoretical approximations by means of \u201cuniform\nstructures\u201d, a mathematical concept lying between topological\nand metrical structures. Although this idea was later adopted by the\nother structuralistic programs, it plays a unique r\u00f4le within\nLudwig\u2019s meta-theory in connection with his finitism. He\nbelieves that the mathematical structures of the infinitely large or\nsmall, a priori, have no physical meaning at all; they are\npreliminary tools to approximate finite physical reality. Uniform\nstructures are vehicles for expressing this particular kind of\napproximation.\n5.2.3 Ludwig\u2019s interpretation of quantum mechanics\n\nWe have already explained that for Ludwig the framework for the\nreconstruction of physical theories was actually only a tool to\ndevelop his interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nIt is no surprise that there are close relationships between the two\nenterprises. We only mention the fact that the reconstruction of\ntheoretical terms by other terms that are more easily accessible is\nparticularly urgent when the theoretical terms refer to the\nmicroscopic domain. This explains in particular why Ludwig is a\nsupporter of a statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nbecause more advanced interpretations such as the\nsingle-particle-state interpretation of the wave function, in his\nopinion, have no axiomatic basis. In the current debate on the\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, the statistical interpretation\n(or ensemble interpretation) plays only a marginal role and is,\nmoreover, usually attributed to L. E. Ballentine (1970). The Wikipedia\nentry on the \u2018ensemble interpretation\u2019 does not mention\nLudwig at all.\n\nIt would be premature, however, to deny Ludwig any influence on the\ndevelopment of quantum theory. There are some achievements, like the\ngeneralization of observables to POV measures, see Busch et al (2016),\nwhich are well known, e.g., in the community practicing quantum\ninformation theory, and which finally go back to Ludwig. Usually, the\nstandard reference for these generalizations is not Ludwig but his\npupil K. Kraus, see Kraus (1983). Finally it should be mentioned that\nLudwig\u2019s axiomatics of quantum mechanics has been revived by new\nmathematical results, see Casinelli and Lahti (2016).\n5.2.4 Ludwig\u2019s late work\n\nOne year before his death Ludwig, together with G\u00e9rald Thurler,\npublished a revised and simplified edition of Ludwig (1990) with the\ntitle \u201cA new foundation of physical theories\u201d. This work\ncannot be used as a textbook but it is a remarkable document of the\ncentral themes of his approach and his general views on physics. The\nbook clearly shows that Ludwig\u2019s main concern is about\nscientific realism, i.e., about the question of how hypothetical\nobjects and relations occurring within a successful theory acquire the\nstatus of physical reality. Entities which cannot claim this status\nare dubbed as \u201cfairy tales\u201d throughout the book. Examples\nof fairy tales in quantum theory are hidden variables and, perhaps\nsurprising for some readers, also the single-particle-state\ninterpretation (in contrast to the ensemble interpretation fostered by\nLudwig).\n\nAmong the new concepts and tools developed in Ludwig/Thurler (2006)\nare the following:\n\nPhysical observations are first translated into sentences of an\nauxiliary mathematical theory containing only finite sets, and, in a\nsecond step, approximately embedded into an idealized theory. By this\nmaneuver the authors accentuate the contrast between finite physical\noperations and mathematical assumptions involving infinite sets.\nInaccuracy sets and unsharp measurements are always considered\nright from the start and not introduced later as in previous versions\nof the Ludwig program.\nThe \u201cbasic domain\u201d of a theory is now that part of the\n\u201capplication domain\u201d where the theory is successfully\napplied, up to a certain degree of inaccuracy.\nThe complicated terminology concerning various kinds of hypotheses\nin Ludwig (1990) is radically reduced to a small number of cases\nincluding fuzzy hypotheses.\nThe problem of unsharp indirect measurements is reformulated in an\nelegant way which yet should be scrutinized by means of case\nstudies.\n\n5.2.5 Summary\n\nGenerally speaking, Ludwig\u2019s program is, in comparison to those\nof Sneed and Scheibe, less descriptive and more normative with respect\nto physics. He developed an ideal of how physical theories should be\nformulated rather than reconstructing the actual practice. The\nprincipal worked-out example that comes close to this ideal is still\nthe axiomatic account of quantum mechanics, as described in Ludwig\n(1985, 1987).\n5.3 Scheibe\u2019s program\n\nThe German philosopher Erhard Scheibe (1927\u20132010) has published\nseveral books and numerous essays on various topics of philosophy of\nscience; see, for example, Scheibe (2001). He has often commented on\nthe programs of Sneed and Ludwig, such as in his \u201cComparison of\ntwo recent views on theories\u201d, reprinted in Scheibe (2001,\n175\u2013194). Moreover, he published one of the earliest case\nstudies of approximate theory reduction; see Scheibe 2001\n(306\u2013323) for the 1973 case study.\n\nIn his books on \u201creduction of physical theories,\u201d Scheibe\n(1997, 1999) developed his own concept of theory, which to some extent\ncan be considered an intermediate position between those of Ludwig and\nSneed. For example, he conveniently combines the model-theoretical and\nsyntactical styles of Sneed and Ludwig, respectively. Since his main\nconcern is reduction, he does not need to cover all the aspects of\nphysical theories that are treated in the other approaches. As already\nmentioned, he proposes a more flexible concept of reduction that is\nopen to extensions arising from new case studies.\n\nA unique feature of Scheibe\u2019s approach is the thorough\ndiscussion of almost all the important cases of reduction considered\nin the physical literature. These include classical vs.\nspecial-relativistic spacetime, Newtonian gravitation vs. general\nrelativity, thermodynamics vs. kinetic theory, and classical vs.\nquantum mechanics. He essentially arrives at the conclusion of a\ndouble incompleteness: the attempts of the physicists to prove\nreduction relations in the above cases are largely incomplete\naccording to their own standards, as well as according to the\nrequirements of a structuralistic concept of reduction. But this\nconcept is also not complete, Scheibe argues, since, for example, a\nsatisfactory understanding of \u201ccounter-factual\u201d limiting\nprocesses such as \\(\\hslash \\rightarrow 0\\) or \\(c\\rightarrow \\infty\\)\nhas not yet been developed. Bolinger in his (2016) gives a fairly\ngeneral account of the structuralistic programme with special emphasis\non Scheibe\u2019s work.\n5.4 Interactions between the three structuralist programs\n\nAs already noted, the programs of Ludwig and Sneed have been\nindependently developed in the 1970s, whereas Scheibe\u2019s program,\nat least partially, originated from a critical review of these two\nprograms. But this is only a coarse description. Additionally, there\nhave been numerous mutual interactions between the three programs that\ninfluenced their later elaborations. Evidence for this interaction is\nprovided, besides various pertinent acknowledgements in books and\narticles, by the following observations.\n\nBalzer, Moulines and Sneed in their (1987) introduce the concepts\nof \u201cspecies of structures\u201d and \u201cuniform\nstructures\u201d that play a central r\u00f4le in Ludwig (1970,\n1978) and are not yet contained in Sneed (1971).\nVice versa, Ludwig in his (1990) added a section 9.3 on theory\nnets (Theorienetze) citing respective works of Balzer and\nMoulines.\nIn his late (2006) Ludwig on p.3 refers to the work of Scheibe\n\u201cbecause of the many similarities\u201d. Later on p.107 he\nmentions a \u201cdiscussion through letters\u201d with Scheibe. This\ncorrespondence has been secured by B. Falkenburg and is waiting for a\nscientific edition.\n\n6. Summary\n\nWe have sketched three structuralistic programs which have been\ndeveloped since the 1970s in order to tackle problems in philosophy of\nphysics, some of which are relevant also for physics itself. Any\nprogram which employs a weighty formal apparatus in order to describe\na domain and to solve specific problems has to be scrutinized with\nrespect to the economy of its tools: to what extent is this apparatus\nreally necessary to achieve its goals? Or is it concerned mainly with\nself-generated problems? We have tried to provide some arguments and\nmaterial for the reader who ultimately has to answer these questions\nfor him- or herself.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Andreas, H., 2014, \u201cCarnapian Structuralism\u201d,\n<em>Erkenntnis</em>, 79(8): 1373\u20131391.", "Andreas, H., and Zenker, F., 2014, \u201cBasic Concepts of\nStructuralism\u201d, <em>Erkenntnis</em>, 79(8):\n1367\u20131372.", "Aubin, D., 1997, \u201cThe Withering Immortality of Nicolas\nBourbaki: A Cultural Connector at the Confluence of Mathematics,\nStructuralism, and the Oulipo in France\u201d, <em>Science in\nContext</em>, 10(02): 297\u2013342.", "Ballentine, L.E., 1970, \u201cThe statistical interpretation of\nquantum mechanics\u201d, <em>Rev.
