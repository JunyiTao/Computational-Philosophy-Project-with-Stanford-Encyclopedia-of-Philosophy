    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition || Intentionality\n3.5 Intentionality\n\n\nIn the canonical literature intentional acts are often assimilated to\nkarmic tendencies in such a way as to suggest that intentions or \nvolitions (cetan\u0101) are not separate from the \npropensities generated by past experience. Abhidharma traditions, on \nthe other hand, operate with the assumption that all cognitions are \ninherently intentional. Indeed, for the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika all \ntypes of consciousness are intentional: they are about an object that\nmust necessarily exist. However, a detailed account of intentionality\nis only found in later philosophical developments associated with the\nBuddhist logico-epistemological school of Dign\u0101ga and \nDharmak\u012brti (see \n \u00a77.3).\n \n\n\nFor instance, in the Treasury of Higher Knowledge (AKBh \nad I, 1ab), Vasubandhu defines action (karman) as \nvolition (cetan\u0101) and its ensuing result. However, the \naction in fact comprises two distinct types of activity: the volition\nitself and the intentional act (cetayitv\u0101). \nFurthermore, the action itself, conceived as a dual process of \nvolition and its result, in fact consists of three discrete stages: \nbodily, verbal, and mental action, corresponding respectively to the \nbasis of the action (or how it is realized), its own nature, and the \ncause which prompts it. Each of these three stages, although \napparently separate, are in fact the same action viewed from three \ndifferent angles. From the perspective of its basis, the action is \ngrounded in the body, which serves as its instrumental medium. From \nthe perspective of its nature, an action consists in its verbal \nand/or habitual expression. Finally, as far as its motivation is \nconcerned, an action finds its ultimate cause in the realm of the \nmental. Thus conception and verbal expression, represent forms of \nactivity that manifest an individual's intention to express certain \nideas or engage with a certain object of experience. This \nintentionality springs from continuous residual impressions \n(v\u0101san\u0101) resulting from past associations of names\nwith the things they designate. \n\n\nIn explaining the relationship between volition and action, \nVasubandhu points to traces left by past volitions to demonstrate \nthat intentional acts are not entirely determined by the present \nvolition. For example, the intention to break a rule of conduct such \nas not lying, is conditioned both by the present volition and by \ntraces left by similar volitional acts. In his Treatise on \nAction (Karmasiddhiprakara\u1e47a, III, 2, 40), \nVasubandhu expands on his idea that impressions of past experience \nare instrumental in effecting the karmic continuum that constitutes \nthe individual personality, by appealing to the notion of receptacle \nconsciousness (\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na). A receptacle \nconsciousness (as the name suggests), can form the basis for the \nreception of consciousness traces \n(vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101san\u0101), whereas a self, if \nconceived as a singular and immutable agent, is incapable of \nproviding such a support. For Vasubandhu and all followers of the \nYog\u0101c\u0101ra theory of consciousness, the analysis of \nintentionality cannot be properly conducted without reference to this\nreceptacle consciousness, a subliminal form of cognitive awareness \nthat serves as a basis for all the propensities, habits, and \ntendencies that inform and direct individual actions (see \n \u00a75.4).\n \n",
