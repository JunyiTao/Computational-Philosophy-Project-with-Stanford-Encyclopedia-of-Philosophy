    "main_text": "Belief, its Aims, and Our Control Over It || The nature of belief\n3.1 The nature of belief\n\nQuestions about what\n belief\n is and how it is formed have typically played a marginal role in the\nethics of belief debate. There is agreement among most analytic\nphilosophers that belief is (roughly) a dispositional, affirmative\nattitude towards a proposition or state of affairs. To believe that\np is to take it that p is true\u2014to take it that\nthe state of affairs described by the sentence\n\u201cp\u201d obtains. Note that this doesn't mean that the\nsubject explicitly believes the proposition that p is true,\nhowever, since the latter is a different and higher order belief (mere\nbelief that p doesn't require possession of the concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d, for instance, whereas the belief that p is\ntrue does). It is also widely agreed that the majority of our\nbeliefs are not occurrent at any given time, and that belief comes in\ndegrees of strength, confidence, or firmness.\n\nAfter this, however, agreement breaks down. Representationalists\nregard beliefs as structures in the mind that represent the\npropositions they affirm\u2014usually in something like a mental\nlanguage (see Fodor 1975 and the entry on\n language of thought).\n Behavioralist-dispositionalists regard beliefs as dispositions to\nact in certain ways in certain circumstances (see Braithwaite\n1932\u20131933). Eliminativists regard talk of \u201cbeliefs\u201d\nas designating convenient fictions that we ascribe to people in folk\npsychology (see Churchland 1981 and the entry on\n eliminative materialism).\n Primitivists think of beliefs as basic mental states which do not\nadmit of analysis. And so on. There is also a big controversy\nregarding whether the most fundamental concept here is of degrees of\nbelief (or credences). \n\nThis disagreement about the nature of belief has (thus far at least)\nnot been taken to impinge on the ethics of belief debate in\nsignificant ways. Of course, eliminativists and behavioralists will\nhave to say that doxastic norms\u2014if there are any\u2014apply at\nbottom to non-doxastic states. Still, modulo those kinds of changes,\nthese and other ontological analyses of belief seem compatible with\nmany different accounts of its ethics.\n",
