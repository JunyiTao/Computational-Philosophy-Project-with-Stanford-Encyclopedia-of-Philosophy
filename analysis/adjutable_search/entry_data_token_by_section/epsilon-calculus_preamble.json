    "main_text": "\n\nThe epsilon calculus is a logical formalism developed by David Hilbert\nin the service of his program in the foundations of mathematics. The\nepsilon operator is a term-forming operator which replaces quantifiers\nin ordinary predicate logic. Specifically, in the calculus, a term\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) denotes some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(A(x)\\), if there\nis one. In Hilbert\u2019s Program, the epsilon terms play the role of\nideal elements; the aim of Hilbert\u2019s finitistic consistency\nproofs is to give a procedure which removes such terms from a formal\nproof. The procedures by which this is to be carried out are based on\nHilbert\u2019s epsilon substitution method. The epsilon calculus,\nhowever, has applications in other contexts as well. The first general\napplication of the epsilon calculus was in Hilbert\u2019s epsilon\ntheorems, which in turn provide the basis for the first correct proof\nof Herbrand\u2019s theorem. More recently, variants of the epsilon\noperator have been applied in linguistics and linguistic philosophy to\ndeal with anaphoric pronouns.\n",
