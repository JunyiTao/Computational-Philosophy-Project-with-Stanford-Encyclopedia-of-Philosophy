    "main_text": "The Intellectio Theory of Concepts\n7. The Intellectio Theory of Concepts\n\nIn the last half of the twentieth century the most documented and\ndiscussed aspect of Chatton\u2019s thought concerned his views on\nhuman cognition and the metaphysics of concepts. He was not especially\ninnovative on these topics, but he had considerable influence on\ncontemporary debates, having brought about a dramatic change of heart\nin Ockham concerning the nature of general concepts.\n\nOckham famously rejected the existence of anything metaphysically\nuniversal outside the human mind; he was an uncompromising nominalist\nin the mediaeval debate on universals. His rejection followed, not\nfrom his razor, but from his conviction, supported through long\nargumentation, that the very idea of a \u2018universal substance\nexisting outside the mind\u2019 was simply incoherent, contradictory,\nor false. No adequate theory of this idea had been or could ever be\ngiven; everything outside the mind is irreducibly individual, not on\naccount of some distinct individuating force, as Scotus had said, but\nsimply in se ipso. On his view, the only things in reality\nthat could in any way be truly denominated \u2018universal\u2019 are\nthe general concepts existing in the human mind, for example the\nconcept man or the concept white. The general\nconcept white is universal, but only in the following\nreduced, metaphysically innocuous sense: white applies to\nmany individual things.\n\nThis line of thought led Ockham quite naturally to offer an account of\nthe metaphysical status of general concepts. To what Aristotelian\ncategory do they belong? Are concepts in the human mind\nsubstances, that is, \u2018things\u2019 in their own right,\nand so are in their own way as real and independent as people and\nhorses? Or are they instead accidents, that is, not\nstand-alone entities, but rather modifications of stand-alone\nentities, the way for Aristotle tall is not a stand-alone\nsubject, but simply a way that a stand-alone subject can be?\nOckham began his career defending the first option, but ended it\ndefending the latter. The cause of this transformation was the\nsustained attacks of Walter Chatton.\n\nOckham\u2019s early theory of concepts, often dubbed \u2018the\nfictum theory\u2019, was probably influenced in some measure\nby the work or at least the terminology of Peter Auriol. According to\nOckham\u2019s first account, a concept is an Aristotelian substance,\nbut not a normal material substance, such as a human being, nor a\nnonmaterial substance, such as an angel \u2013 such beings can be the\nsubjects of accidents and so could be said to have esse\nsubjectivum (=subjective being) \u2013 rather, concepts are in\nan entirely different class of substances, which have the sort of\nexistence in the mind that an object fashioned by thought has, to wit,\nesse objectivum (the being of a thought-object), or, as he\nsometimes says, a concept is a fictum (=a mentally-fashioned\nbeing).\n\nChatton criticized this theory relentlessly, primarily on the ground\nthat concepts as ficta are an unnecessary intermediary\nbetween the cognizer and the thing cognized, such that the cognizer\nwould be immediately aware only of the general concept, and not of the\nindividuals picked out by the general concept. In short, the\nfictum theory is not consistent with direct realism, which\nwas a hallmark of Ockhamist epistemology. Chatton suggested that it\nmade the most sense from an Aristotelian point of view to treat\nconcepts as accidents, and not as substances at all. On\nChatton\u2019s view, concepts are modifications of the soul, and in\nparticular my concept of \\(X\\) is nothing more than my act of thinking\nabout \\(X\\). Concepts are not intermediaries that we then think with,\nbut are rather simply our very acts of thinking themselves, i.e., my\nconcept of \\(X\\) is just my intellectio (=act of thinking) of\ninstances of \\(X\\). In response to Chatton\u2019s criticism and his\npositive alternative, Ockham abandoned his fictum theory, at\nfirst with some hesitation, wavering between this early theory and\nChatton\u2019s new intellectio model, subsequently embracing\nit more fully, and finally, in his most mature philosophical\nreflection on the topic, even arguing against the old fictum\ntheory. The stages of Ockham\u2019s change of mind are well\ndocumented in the different versions of his commentary on the\nSentences, and are even an important source for our dating of\nthose different versions.\n",
