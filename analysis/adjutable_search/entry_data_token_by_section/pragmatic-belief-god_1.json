    "main_text": "Moral Arguments as Pragmatic Arguments\n2. Moral Arguments as Pragmatic Arguments\n\nPragmatic arguments in support of theistic belief can either be\npredicated on prudence or on morality. By pragmatic arguments\npredicated on morality I mean arguments that contend that morality, or\nsome proper part of morality, presupposes, or is facilitated by\ntheistic belief. And if morality, or the proper part of morality, is\nrational, then so too is theistic belief. Put\n generally:[3]\n\nDoing \u03b1 helps to bring about \u03b2, and\nIt is morally desirable that \u03b2. So,\nIt is prima facie morally desirable to do \u03b1.\n\n\nSince (4) specifies actions, we should understand accepting theistic\npropositions as actions, even if believing is not an action (for more\non the distinction between acceptance and belief, see the section,\n\u201cPragmatic Arguments and Belief,\u201d below).\n\nIt is important to recognize the distinction between theoretical moral\narguments for theism (arguments intended to show that God exists), and\npragmatic moral arguments for the rationality of theistic belief.\nGeorge Mavrodes, for instance, constructs a theoretical moral argument\nby contending that it would be extremely odd that we would have moral\nobligations the fulfillment of which results in a net loss to the\nagent. Such a world seems absurd (Mavrodes, 1986). His argument is\nbuilt upon the idea of a Russellian world, a universe in which mental\nevents are products of non-mental events, and in which there\u2019s\nno human post-mortem survival, and extinction is the final end of\nevery biological species. A Russellian world implies atheism.\nSummarized, Mavrodes\u2019 argument is that there are real moral\nobligations in the actual world. But, real moral obligations would be\nabsurd in a Russellian world, since fulfilling moral obligations often\ncause a net loss to the moral agent and there is no deep explanation\nof real moral obligation in a Russellian world (the deep features of a\nRussellian world would be things like forces and atoms and chance).\nBut, fulfilling moral obligation is not absurd. So, in this respect,\nthere is reason to think that the actual world is not a Russellian\nworld.\n\nTwo examples of pragmatic moral arguments are Adams (1979) and\nZagzebski (1987). Adams builds his argument on the concept of\ndemoralization \u2013 weakening of moral motivation \u2013 and the\nconcept of a moral order \u2013 roughly, the idea that to achieve a\nbalance of good over evil in the universe requires something more than\nhuman effort, yet human effort can add or detract from the total value\nof the universe. While we cannot do it all on our own, the idea is, we\ncan make a significant difference for better or worse. In short,\nAdam\u2019s argument is that it is demoralizing not to believe that\nthere is a moral order in the universe, and demoralization is morally\nundesirable. So, there is moral advantage in accepting that there is a\nmoral order, and theism provides the best account of why that is.\nHence, there\u2019s moral advantage in accepting theism.\n\nZagzebski builds her argument upon the ideas of moral skepticism and\nmoral efficacy, and, though she does not employ the term, moral order.\nMorality is efficacious if we can make significant contributions to\nthe production of good in the universe and to the elimination of evil.\nMoral skepticism is a doubting of our ability to acquire moral\nknowledge, and a doubting of moral efficacy. Zagzebski argues that it\nis rational to try to be moral only if it is rational to believe that\nthe probability that the attempt will succeed and will produce a great\ngood is not outweighed by the probability that one will have to\nsacrifice goods in the course of the attempt. But given what we know\nof human abilities and history, it is not rational to believe that the\nattempt to be moral is likely to succeed if there is no moral order.\nSince it is rational to try to be moral, it is rational to believe\nthat there is moral order in the universe, and Christian doctrine is,\nin part, an account of there being a moral order in the universe. So,\naccepting Christian theism is more rational than accepting that\nthere\u2019s no moral order in the universe.\n\nTheistic moral pragmatic arguments may face an objection similar to\nthe many-gods objection to Pascal\u2019s wager. The many-gods\nobjection contends that the betting options of the wager are not\nlimited to Christianity and atheism alone, since one could formulate a\nPascalian Wager for Islam, certain sects of Buddhism, or for any of\nthe competing sects found within Christianity\n itself.[4]\n A similar problem arises for theistic moral pragmatic arguments, at\nleast insofar as those arguments are intended to provide strong\nsupport for theistic belief. Let\u2019s say that a pragmatic argument\nprovides strong support for theism just in case it provides reason for\nthinking that theism alone provides the benefit; and let\u2019s say\nthat a pragmatic argument provides weak support for theism just in\ncase it provides reason for thinking that theism is just one of\nseveral alternatives in providing the benefit. Pascal\u2019s Wager,\nfor instance, is intended to provide strong support for theism; while\nJames\u2019s Will to Believe argument is intended to provide weak\nsupport. Pragmatic moral arguments, if they are to provide strong\nsupport for theism, must provide reason to think that theistic belief\nalone is necessary for morality, or that theistic belief best\nfacilitates moral practice. But it\u2019s far from clear that\ntheistic belief exceeds its competitors in facilitating moral\npractice. Until reason for thinking that is forthcoming, it would be\npremature to hold that theistic moral pragmatic arguments provide\nstrong support.\n",
