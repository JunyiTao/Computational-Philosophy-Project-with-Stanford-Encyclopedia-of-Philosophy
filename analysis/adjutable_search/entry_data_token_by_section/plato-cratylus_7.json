    "main_text": "The Tool Analogy (386e\u2013390e) || The Name as a Tool for Naming\n4.1 The Name as a Tool for Naming\n\nTo set up the analogy between names and tools, Socrates considers\nactions. Given that objects have a stable being or a stable nature of\ntheir own, actions too must have a stable nature (386e). This seems to\nmean that a particular act needs to meet a certain objective standard\nto count as a genuine instance of a given action\n type.[2]\n As Socrates points out, one will meet this standard if and only if\none handles a naturally suitable tool in a naturally fitting way\n(387a\u2013b). This entails, crucially, that a tool for a given\naction needs to fulfil an objective or natural standard: It needs to\nbe such as to enable a competent person to perform this action.\n\nWhat do these plausible reflections about tools have to do with\nnames? To make the connection, Socrates argues that naming\nqua part of speaking is an action with a stable nature\n(387b\u2013d). He combines this claim with his observation that\nactions with a stable nature need to be performed by means of a\nnaturally suitable tool\u2014and infers that naming needs to be\nperformed by means of such a tool. This tool\nis\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014the name (387d\u2013388a). It follows\nthat names are subject to a natural standard in the same (or at least\na similar) sense as drills or shuttles.\n\nAs it stands, this analogical argument is frustratingly abstract. Its\npurport becomes clearer when Socrates provides two closely related\naccounts of naming a little later. He says, first, that \u201cwe\nteach something to each other and separate the objects as they\nstand\u201d (388b) when we name; and he says, second, that we use\nnames for \u201cteaching and for separating being\u201d\n(388b\u2013c). What is the purport of these two accounts of naming?\nConsider the first one first. It is widely and plausibly assumed that\nSocrates explicates the sense in which \u201cwe teach something to\neach other\u201d in naming when he says that we \u201cseparate the\nobjects as they stand\u201d, and so it is best to focus on this\nphrase. Many authors read it as a description of the act of using a\nname to mark off a species or a kind. Some believe that this act\noccurs only in the context of Platonic division and must be\ndistinguished from more mundane forms of naming (see, e.g., Sedley\n2003: 60f. and Ademollo 2011: 112f.); others point out that even in\nthe bread-and-butter sentences \u201cI love dogs\u201d or \u201cHer\nfavorite pastime is reading\u201d, the names \u201cdog\u201d and\n\u201creading\u201d seem to pick out a kind of animal and a kind of\nactivity (Mei\u00dfner 2019: 127\u2013132). Be that as it\nmay\u2014it seems reasonable to assume that Socrates defines naming\nas the act of picking out objects (in the broadest sense of the term)\nas a kind or a species. This construal of Socrates\u2019\nfirst account of naming makes his second account transparent as well.\nReaders of the Platonic dialogues are, after all, well acquainted with\nthe idea that if a name is used to designate a class of objects that\nhave something in common, it can also be said to refer to what its\nreferents have in common\u2014the way of being or the ousia\nthey share (see, e.g., Laches 190e\u2013192a or\nMeno 71e\u201372c). It thus makes sense to move from the\nclaim that we \u201cseparate the objects as they stand\u201d to the\ncontention that we use names \u201cfor separating being\u201d or a\nway of being.\n\nWhen Socrates ascribes a stable nature to naming, he is thus relying\non the assumption that one performs an act of naming if and only if\none picks out a kind or, equivalently, the way of being that is shared\nby the members of this kind. Given this result, the application of his\nreflections on tools like drills or shuttles to names at\n387b\u2013388c is a little easier to follow. His central point is\npresumably that names are subject to a natural standard insofar as\nthey need to be suitable instruments for picking out a kind. The\nsecond stage of his analogical argument will elaborate\nthis\u2014still somewhat vague and elusive\u2014point.\n",
