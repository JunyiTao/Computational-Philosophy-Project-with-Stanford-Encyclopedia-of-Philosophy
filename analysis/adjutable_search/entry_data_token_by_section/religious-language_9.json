    "main_text": "The Use of Religious Language || Fictionalism\n3.3 Fictionalism\n\nFictionalists defend the moral and intellectual legitimacy of engaging\nwith a field of discourse for speakers that do not believe that the\nsentences of that discourse are true (for a general overview see\nDivers & Liggins 2005, for a review focused on religious\nfictionalism see Scott & Malcolm 2018, Brock 2020). Some\nfictionalists propose that that speakers\nemploy quasi-assertion. A quasi-assertion is a speech act\nthat has the appearance of an assertion\u2014it is the utterance of\nan indicative sentence\u2014but it does not commit the speaker to the\ntruth of the expressed proposition. The speaker goes along with\nor accepts the content of what is quasi-asserted but does not\nthereby believe it.  The details of quasi-assertion depend on the kind\nof fictionalism being proposed and a variety of options have been\nproposed (for an overview see Kalderon 2005: 119\u2013129). On some\naccounts, quasi-assertion involves the assertion of something other\nthan the propositional content of the uttered sentence. For example, a\nfictionalist about mathematics might argue that a mathematical\nsentence M is used to assert that M is true according to standard\nmathematics (Field 1980). Alternatively, to quasi-assert a\nsentence might be to\npretend to assert it. Comparable approaches are found among\nreligious fictionalist. Peter Lipton (2007), for instance, suggests\nthat engagement with religious could be akin to immersion in a\nfiction; the fictionalist accordingly pretends that the claims of\nreligion are true. Other religious fictionalists (such as Robin Le\nPoidevin 2016, 2019) propose that the fictionalist, without believing that a\nreligious utterance is true, may say it on the basis that it is true\nwithin some religious tradition.\n\nParticularly important for our purposes is the distinction between\nrevolutionary and hermeneutic fictionalism. Revolutionary religious\nfictionalism is not a theory of religious language\u2014it is not a\nposition on what speakers actually mean\u2014but instead a\nrevisionary proposal that is usually offered in response to error\ntheory about religion. Despite religious claims being untrue,\nrevolutionary fictionalists argue religious discourse has sufficient\npragmatic benefits that we should continue to employ religious\nlanguage and engage in religious thought rather than eliminate it,\neven though we should not believe that it is true. In general,\nrevolutionary fictionalism is motivated by the wish to continue to\nreceive the social and other benefits of engagement with a religion\nwithout commitment to its truth. LePoidevin and Lipton are both\nrevolutionary fictionalists. The Sea of Faith Network, inspired by the\nwork of Don Cupitt (1980), can also be understood as sympathetic to\nrevolutionary fictionalism because it promotes Christian practice and\nthe continuing engagement with religious discourse without religious\nbelief. Interesting though they are, we will not be investigating these\ntheories further because they are not saying anything about the\nmeaning of religious utterances. Instead, they are recommending a change\nof attitude towards the claims of religion and quasi-assert rather than\nassert them.\n\nHermeneutic fictionalism about religion is the view that speakers are\nnot committed to the truth of what they say on religious matters:\nspeakers are quasi-asserting rather than asserting indicative\nreligious sentences. This is not offered as a proposal about what\nspeakers should do but instead as a fact about current linguistic\npractice. Speakers accept but do not believe what they say when\nengaging in religious discourse. So, along with other positions\ndiscussed in this section, hermeneutic fictionalists reject (b*).\nDefending this position may seem like a tall order: isn\u2019t\nhermeneutic fictionalism undermined by the apparent linguistic\nevidence that religious speakers are committed to the truth of what\nthey say? Nevertheless, there are a couple of positions that look to\nbe potential contenders for religious hermeneutic fictionalism.\n\nFirst, Georges Rey has defended a position that he calls\nmeta-atheism according to which practitioners of religion\nexhibit widespread self-deception about what they say (2006: 337). For\nanyone with a basic education in science, Rey contends, it is obvious\nthat religious claims are false. Rey is not proposing, however, that\neducated speakers are insincere when they affirm religious claims\nsince they may think of themselves as believing what they are saying\n(2006: 338). Instead, speakers are in a state of self-deception. While\nthey may recognise on a more critical level that religious claims are\nfalse, they do not entertain this when engaging in religious\ndiscourse. Why do religious people do not recognise and consciously\ndraw out the implications of their disbelief? Rey suggests a number of\nreasons: loyalty to family and other social groups, personal ties and\nidentifications with religious institutions, resistance to changing\none\u2019s public stance, the wish for one\u2019s life to be part of\na larger project. Rey supplements his arguments by pointing up\ndifferences between religious and scientific judgements aimed at\nshowing that the latter are \u201cunderstood to be fictional from the\nstart\u201d (2006: 345). Now, Rey\u2019s position is, to say the\nleast, contentious\u2014for starters, his contention that religious\nclaims are obviously false seems unsupportable (see Scott 2015 for a\nmore detailed critique). However, with some assumptions about\nself-deception, we can understand meta-atheism as a kind of\nhermeneutic religious fictionalism. Speakers are in a conflicted state\nof self-deception that falls short of belief: on some level or in some\nuncritical contexts speakers treat religious claims as if they were\ntrue, while also believing in critical and reflective contexts that\nthey are false. Accordingly, in uttering religious sentences speakers\nengage in quasi-assertion whereby they accept what is said without\ngenuinely believing it to be true.\n\nSecond, a point of debate in current research on the nature of faith\nis whether propositional faith\u2014i.e., faith that\np\u2014requires belief that p. Supporters of\ntraditional doxastic accounts defend this condition while supporters\nof non-doxastic theories of faith argue that it is sufficient that one\nhave a positive cognitive attitude towards p other than belief.\nThere are various proposal for what this non-doxastic attitude\nis. Candidates include: acceptance (Alston 2007), assent (Schellenberg\n2005), assumption (Swinburne 2005; Howard-Snyder 2013), trust (Audi\n2011), hope (McKaughan 2013; Pojman 1986 and 2001), or acquiescence\n(Buchak 2012). However, to the extent that religious discourse is in\nthe business of trading in the expression of faithful attitudes then\nit follows from the non-doxastic position that a speaker may sincerely\naffirm their faith in a religious proposition without believing it to\nbe true. Notably, some non-doxastic theorists offer linguistic\nevidence to show that speakers do not believe what they say. This\nappears to concede a hermeneutic fictionalist account of faithful\ndiscourse (for discussion see Malcolm & Scott 2017 and Scott\n2020). It seems likely that many proponents of non-doxastic theories\nof faith will not welcome the characterisation of their position as a\nvariety of hermeneutic fictionalism (see Howard-Snyder 2016 and\nMalcolm 2018).  However, non-doxastic theories are usually presented\nprimarily as psychological or epistemological theories about the\nnature of faith; the implications of the position for religious\ndiscourse, and its relationship with hermeneutic fictionalism, have\nyet to be fully set out.\n",
