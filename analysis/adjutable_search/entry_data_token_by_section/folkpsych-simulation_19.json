    "main_text": "Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons || The Mirror Neurons Controversy\n6.1 The Mirror Neurons Controversy\n\nWe wrote that ST proposes that mirroring processes (i.e., activations\nof mirror mechanisms in the perception mode): (A) are\n(low-level) simulation processes, and (B) contribute (either\nconstitutively or causally) to mindreading (Gallese et al. 2004;\nGallese & Goldman 1998; Goldman 2006, 2008b; Hurley 2005). Both\n(A) and (B) have been vehemently contested by ST\u2019s\nopponents.\n\nBeginning with (A), it has been argued that mirroring processes do not\nqualify as simulation processes, because they fail to satisfy the\ndefinition of \u201csimulation process\u201d (Gallagher 2007;\nHerschbach 2012; Jacob 2008; Spaulding 2012) and/or because they are\nbetter characterized in different terms, e.g., as enactive perceptual\nprocesses (Gallagher 2007) or as elements in an information-rich\nprocess (Spaulding 2012). As for (B), the main worry runs as follows.\nGranting that mirroring processes are simulation processes, what\nevidence do we have for the claim that they contribute to mindreading?\nThis, in particular, has been asked with respect to the role of\nmirroring processes in \u201caction understanding\u201d (i.e., the\ninterpretation of an agent\u2019s behavior in terms of the\nagent\u2019s intentions, goals, etc.). After all, the neuroscientific\nevidence just indicates that action mirroring correlates with\nepisodes of action understanding, but correlation is not causation,\nlet alone constitution. In fact, there are no studies examining\nwhether disruption of the monkey mirror neuron circuit results in\naction understanding deficits, and the evidence on human action\nunderstanding following damage to the action mirror mechanism is\ninconclusive at best (Hickok 2009). In this regard, some authors have\nsuggested that the most plausible hypothesis is instead that action\nmirroring follows (rather than causes or constitutes) the\nunderstanding of others\u2019 mental states (Csibra 2007; Jacob\n2008). For example, Jacob (2008) proposes that the job of mirroring\nprocesses in the action domain is just that of computing a\nrepresentation of the observed agent\u2019s next movement,\non the basis of a previous representation of the\nagent\u2019s intention. Similar deflationary accounts of the action\nmirror mechanism have been given by Brass et al. (2007), Hickok\n(2014), and Vannuscorps and Caramazza (2015)\u2014these accounts\ntypically take the STS (superior temporal sulcus, a brain region\nlacking mirror neurons) to be the critical neural area for action\nunderstanding.\n\nThere are various ways to respond to these criticisms. A strong\nresponse argues that they are based on a misunderstanding of the\nrelevant empirical findings, as well as on a mischaracterization of\nthe role that ST attributes to the action mirror mechanism in action\nunderstanding (Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia 2010, 2014). A weaker\nresponse holds that the focus on action understanding is a bit of a\nred herring, given that the most robust evidence in support of the\ncentral role played by mirroring processes in mindreading comes from\nthe emotion domain (Goldman 2008b). We will consider the weaker\nresponse here.\n\nGoldman and Sripada (2005) discuss a series of paired deficits in\nemotion production and face-based emotion mindreading. These\ndeficits\u2014they maintain\u2014are best explained by the\nhypothesis that one attributes emotions to someone else through\nsimulating these emotions in oneself: when the ability to undergo the\nemotion breaks down, the mindreading capacity breaks down as well.\nBarlassina (2013) elaborates on this idea by considering\nHuntington\u2019s Disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder\nresulting in, among other things, damage to the disgust mirror\nmechanism. As predicted by ST, the difficulties individuals with HD\nhave in experiencing disgust co-occur with an impairment in\nattributing disgust to someone else on the basis of observing her\nfacial expression\u2014despite perceptual abilities and knowledge\nabout disgust being preserved in this clinical population. Individuals\nsuffering from HD, however, exhibit an intact capacity for disgust\nmindreading on the basis of non-facial visual stimuli. For this\nreason, Barlassina concludes by putting forward an ST-TT hybrid model\nof disgust mindreading on the basis of visual stimuli.\n",
