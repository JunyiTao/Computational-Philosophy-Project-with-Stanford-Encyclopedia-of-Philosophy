    "main_text": "British and American Idealism\n8. British and American Idealism\n\nThings were different in the English-speaking world, where idealism\nbecame an important topic in a wide spectrum of philosophical\ndiscussions ranging from metaphysics via aesthetics to moral and\nsocial theories. In England, Scotland, and Wales an idealism that was\nultimately both epistemological and ontological in motivation became\nthe dominant approach to philosophy for several decades, while in the\nUnited States idealism could not monopolize philosophy, having to\nshare the stage with and ultimately reach an accommodation with\npragmatism, but it nevertheless also flourished for several decades.\nThe best known and most outspoken spokesmen in favor of idealistic\nconceptions in metaphysics and elsewhere in Britain in these years\nwere Thomas Hill Green and Francis Herbert Bradley at Oxford and John\nMcTaggart Ellis McTaggart at Cambridge, while in the United States the\nmost prominent idealist was Josiah Royce at Harvard, where\nidealism\u2019s having to share the stage with pragmatism was\npersonified in Royce\u2019s friendly rivalry with William James and\nin Royce\u2019s ultimate attempt to synthesize his view with that of\nCharles Sanders Peirce. Although all of these figures are frequently\ncharacterized as being indebted to Hegel\u2019s writings and\nadvocating a Hegelian view of reality, their various positions are at\nbest in a somewhat indirect, almost only metaphorical, sense informed\nby Hegel\u2019s philosophy. In fact, these philosophers were more\nwilling to call themselves idealists than had been the earlier German\nidealists who supposedly inspired them, but who as has been argued\nwere just as interested in escaping as in accepting the label. This is\nshown most tellingly insofar as their approach to a defense of\nidealism goes back to a state of the discussion characteristic of the\nperiod prior to Hegel and German idealism in general, rather\nconnecting more directly to an understanding of idealism influenced by\neighteenth-century disputes in the wake of Berkeley. None of these\nfigures except perhaps Royce continued to explore a dynamic conception\nof idealism distinctive of Hegel and the other German\nidealists\u2014Royce in fact wrote more extensively and insightfully\non Hegel and his immediate predecessors than any of the others with\nthe exception of McTaggart. In general, the late nineteenth-century\nidealists were more inclined to think of idealism or, maybe more\naccurately, spiritualism again as a genuine alternative to materialism\nand embark again on the controversy whether matter or mind/spirit is\nthe ultimate \u201cstuff\u201d of reality. These philosophers were\nthus more willing to identify themselves as idealists than had been\ntheir predecessors. However, these philosophers were not all equally\nmonists. Both Bradley and McTaggart, for whom a defense of idealism\nconsists mainly in establishing the ontological point that reality is\nexclusively spirit, were, and thus their idealism could also be called\n\u201cspiritual monism\u201d. But both Green at the beginning of the\nmovement and Royce towards its end strove for more nuanced positions,\nnot excluding the existence of matter from their idealisms, and thus\nresisted monism. But all their efforts to establish a convincing form\nof idealism, whether in the form of spiritualism or in a form that\nallowed some role for matter as well, became rapidly unfashionable\neven during the lifetimes of all these philosophers (except for Green,\nwho died young) due to what was called \u201cthe revolt against\nidealism\u201d staged at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain\nby Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore and a decade later in the United\nStates by a group of \u201cNew Realists\u201d. However, as we will\nsuggest at least Russell was himself pushed back in the direction of\nsome form of idealism, perhaps only on epistemological grounds, by the\ntime his own thought reached the stage of his \u201clogical\natomism\u201d. For the most part, however, after the attacks on\nBradley and Royce, explicit avowal of idealism became rare, with a few\nexceptions such as the prominent defense of idealism by Brand\nBlanshard in the 1930s and less prominent defenses by Timothy Sprigge\nand John Foster in the early 1980s\n\nThomas Hill Green (1836\u201382) was the first of the great Oxford\nidealists. He is best remembered for a lengthy polemic with Hume that\nhe published in the form of an introduction to a collected edition of\nHume that he co-edited and for his posthumously published\nProlegomena to Ethics, which is a polemic against\nutilitarianism from the point of view of a perfectionism inspired by\nKant as well as by Hegel. But the first of the four books of the\nProlegomena is a \u201cMetaphysics of Knowledge\u201d,\nbeginning with a statement of \u201cThe Spiritual Principle in\nKnowledge and in Nature\u201d (1893: 13), which argues for a form of\nidealism on both epistemological and ontological grounds, and\nGreen\u2019s posthumous works also included a set of lectures on Kant\nin which he engaged quite directly with Kant\u2019s form of idealism.\nGreen also left behind a set of Lectures on the Principles of\nPolitical Obligation that form one of the crucial documents of\nthe political and social philosophy of British idealism and of\nidealism in the broadest sense mentioned at the outset of this\nentry.\n\nGreen\u2019s motivation in arguing for idealism in the\nProlegomena is to prepare the way for a conception of the\nwill as free and creative as the foundation of his ethics\u2014in\nthis regard Green\u2019s view is as much in the spirit of\nKant\u2019s practical idealism as it is Hegelian. Green\u2019s\nidealism is expounded in three main steps. First, and here also much\ninfluenced by Kant, he argues that knowledge never consists in the\nmere apprehension of discrete items, but in the recognition of order\nor relation, and that such order or relation is not given but is\nconstituted by and in consciousness. Thus,\n\n\nThe terms \u201creal\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d\u2026have\nno meaning except for a consciousness which presents its experiences\nto itself as determined by relations, and at the same time conceives a\nsingle and unalterable order of relations determining them, with which\nits temporary presentation, as each experience occurs, of the\nrelations determining it may be contrasted. (Prolegomena,\n1893: 17)\n\n\nFrom this he infers that\n\n\nexperience, in the sense of a consciousness of events as a related\nseries\u2014and in no other sense can it help to account for the\nknowledge of an order of nature\u2014cannot be explained by any\nnatural history, properly so called, (1893: 21\u201322)\n\n\nbut must instead be constituted by mind itself, or,\n\n\nthe understanding which presents an order of nature to us is in\nprinciple one with an understanding which constitutes that order\nitself. (1893: 23)\n\n\nThus far, Green\u2019s position could be considered an\nepistemological argument for idealism. However, he quickly moves\nbeyond a merely epistemological argument, because his next move is to\nargue that since the order of which any individual human being is in\nvarious ways and to various degrees aware obviously extends beyond\nwhat could plausibly be thought to be constituted just by that\nindividual, the order of which we are each aware must be constituted\nby a mind or intelligence greater than that of any of us, thus there\nmust be \u201can eternal intelligence realized in the related facts\nof the world\u201d, and the world must be \u201ca system of related\nfacts rendered possible by such an intelligence\u201d, which\nintelligence \u201cpartially and gradually reproduces itself in us,\ncommunicating piece-meal but in inseparable correlation\u201d aspects\nof that order to each of us if not complete knowledge of it to any of\nus (1893: 38). Green\u2019s insistence on a supra-individual\nintelligence as the source of cosmic order in which individual\nintelligences in some way participate is a decided move beyond\nepistemology, and in his own view it is also a significant departure\nfrom Kant, whose agnosticism about the real nature of things in\nthemselves, at least in the theoretical mood, \u201cwould at once\nwithhold us\u201d from such an inference to the \u201cspirituality\nof the real world\u201d (1893: 43). However, and here is the third\nmain thesis of Green\u2019s form of idealism, the participation of\nindividual human beings in the supra-individual intelligence which\nconstitutes the comprehensive system of relations can be seen as an\napprehension of some portion of that order by animal\norganisms:\n\n\nin the growth of our experience, in the process of our learning to\nknow the world, an animal organism, which has its history in time,\ngradually becomes the vehicle of an eternally complete consciousness;\n(1893: 72)\n\n\nit is the eternal consciousness,\n\n\nas so far realized in or communicated to us through modification of\nthe animal organism, that constitutes our knowledge, with the\nrelations, characteristic of knowledge, into which time does not\nenter, which are not in becoming but are once for all what they are.\n(1893: 73)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s form of spiritualism is thus not incompatible with\nontological dualism: the object of all knowledge is the complete and\neternal order of things, which must be constituted by an intelligence\ngreater than that of any individual human being, but individual human\nbeings are in fact organisms, thus matter, to which some aspect of\nthat intelligence is communicated. The epistemological aspect of\nGreen\u2019s idealism is complete, because knowledge on the part of\nan individual is understood as consisting in a grasp of an order that\nis itself mental, but his ontology is not exclusively mentalistic, for\nwhile it includes the necessary existence of a supra-individual\nintelligence or spirit but allows the existence of animal organisms\n(and thus presumably of other forms of matter as well).\n\nFrancis Herbert Bradley (1846\u20131924), however, argued for a more\nexclusive spiritualism, or an idealist ontology. Bradley presents his\nmetaphysical views on the constitution and the main characteristics of\nreality most explicitly in Appearance and Reality: A Metaphysical\nEssay, which was first published in 1893 and reprinted many times\nduring his lifetime. He famously proceeds from the claim that the\ntraditional and received \u201cideas by which we try to understand\nthe universe\u201d are contradictory (1893: 11 [1897: 9]). He\nsubstantiates this claim by examining a range of central concepts from\nmetaphysics and epistemology, among them the concepts of primary and\nsecondary qualities, of substance and attribute, of quality and\nrelation, space and time, of causality as well as the concept of a\nthing and that of the self. The best known of his destructive\narguments against these conceptions is that against qualities and\nrelations because it played a role in the discussion that arose at the\nturn of the twentieth century between Bradley, Russell and Moore\n(among others) about the logical and ontological status of relations,\ni.e., whether they are \u201cinternal\u2019\u2019 or\n\u201cexternal\u201d to their terms. As to qualities and relations\nBradley claims: \n\n\nThe arrangement of given facts into relations and qualities may be\nnecessary in practice, but it is theoretically unintelligible. The\nreality, so characterized, is not true reality, but is appearance.\n(1893: 25 [1897: 21]) \n\n\nHe starts with pointing out that \u201c[q]ualities are nothing\nwithout relations\u201d (ibid.). This is so because in order to be\nqualities they have to differ from other qualities and hence have to\nbe distinct. However, without relations they could not be distinct.\nBut distinctiveness presupposes plurality and plurality relations.\n\n\n\nTheir plurality depends on relation, and, without that relation, they\nare not distinct. But, if not distinct, then not different, and\ntherefore not qualities. (1893: 28 [1897: 24]) \n\n\nNot only without relations are qualities nothing,\n\u201c[u]nfortunately, taken together with them, they are equally\nunintelligible\u201d (1893: 30 [1897: 25]). The reason is that one\ncannot account for their distinctiveness if their distinctiveness is\nbased on their being different: \u201cIn short, qualities in a\nrelation have turned out as unintelligible as were qualities without\none\u201d (1893: 31\u201332 [1897: 27]). The same holds, according\nto Bradley, from the side of relations. \u201cThey are nothing\nintelligible, either with or without their qualities\u201d (1893: 32\n[1897: 27]). They are nothing intelligible without qualities because\n\u201ca relation without terms seems mere verbiage\u201d (ibid.).\nThey are nothing intelligible with qualities either for in order for a\nrelation to relate it must stand in a relation to what it relates\nwhich makes it into a quality that requires \u201ca new\nconnecting relation\u201d (ibid.) if it is to relate to that quality.\nBradley summarizes as the result: \n\n\nThe conclusion to which I am brought is that a relational way of\nthought\u2014any one that moves by the machinery of terms and\nrelations\u2014must give appearance, and not truth. (1893: 33 [1897:\n28]) \n\n\nThe result of his examination not just of the concepts of quality and\nrelation but of all the other concepts he deals with consists in the\nverdict that all attempts to capture the true nature of reality in\nterms of these categories are futile because all these concepts are\nunintelligible, inconsistent and in the end self-contradictory. This\nmeans that what is designated by means of them cannot be real, but can\nonly reflect the way the world appears to us, not the way it really\nis. This diagnosis is based on Bradley\u2019s fundamental conviction\nthat \u201cultimate reality is such that it does not contradict\nitself\u201d (1893: 136 [1897: 120]). He takes this to be \u201can\nabsolute criterion\u201d (ibid.). However, to be just appearance is\nnot to be unreal in the sense of an illusion. On the contrary,\nalthough appearance is \u201cinconsistent with itself\u201d, one\ncannot deny its existence or \u201cdivorce it from reality\u201d\nbecause \u201creality, set on one side and apart from all appearance,\nwould assuredly be nothing\u201d (1893: 132 [1897: 114]).\n\nBut does this ontological argument for idealism exclude epistemology\naltogether? That is, since appearance always proves to be an\ninadequate way in which reality is present to us, is it beyond our\nmeans ever to become acquainted with the true essence of ultimate\nreality or can we avoid skepticism and claim that it is indeed\npossible for us to have access to the constitutive nature of reality?\nBradley emphatically endorses the latter possibility. According to\nhim, the self-contradictoriness of what is appearance already implies\nthat there is positive knowledge of reality: reality has to be One in\nthe sense that it does not allow discord and it must be such that it\ncan include diversity (cf. 1893: 140 [1897: 123]), i.e., \u201cthe Absolute is \u2026 an\nindividual and a system\u201d (1893: 144 [1897: 127]). This character\nof reality as an internally diversified individual system is revealed\nto us in sentient experience. \u201cSentient experience \u2026 is\nreality, and what is not this is not real\u201d (ibid.). According to\nBradley it is this sentient experience that \u201cis commonly called\npsychical existence\u201d (ibid.). The material basis of sentient\nexperience is exhausted in feeling, thought, and volition. Thus\nreality consists in what has to be taken as the undifferentiated unity\nof these modes of sentient experience before these modes make their\nappearance as different aspects of experience. This leads Bradley to\nassume that what is ultimately real is just what gives rise to\nappearances where appearances have to be understood as specific forms\nunder which the underlying undifferentiated unity appears in each of\nthese different aspects of experience. In his words: \n\n\n\u2026 there is no way of qualifying the Real except by appearances,\nand outside the Real there remains no space in which appearances could\nlive. (1893: 551 [1897: 489]) \n\n\nAlthough he concedes \u201cour complete inability to understand this\nconcrete unity in detail\u201d he insists that this inability\n\u201cis no good ground for our declining to entertain it\u201d\n(1894: 160 [1897: 141]). And although he claims at the end of his\nmetaphysical essay that he does not know whether his\n\u201cconclusions\u201d are to be called Realism or Idealism (1893:\n547 [1897: 485]), at the very end he nevertheless abruptly states:\n\u201cWe may fairly close this work then by insisting that Reality is\nspiritual\u201d (1893: 552 [1897: 489). This might lead us to\nassume that, \u201cin the end\u201d (a favorite phrase of\nBradley\u2019s), it was primarily his search for a basis for\nspiritualism and not so much a defense of idealism understood as\nopposed to realism that motivated him to explore the true nature of\nreality; in other words, he was ultimately driven by an impulse toward\nidealism by ontological premises even though he had developed powerful\narguments epistemological arguments for idealism.\n The identification of idealism with spiritualism, thus again an\nontological interpretation of idealism, is most explicit in the works\nof John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart (1866\u20131925). His earliest\nwork, \u201cThe Further Determination of the Absolute\u201d (first published as a pamphlet in 1893, then as Chapter IX of Studies in Hegelian Cosmology [1901] and in Philosophical Studies [1934]), starts\nwith the following proclamation:\n\n\nThe progress of an idealistic philosophy may, from some points of\nview, be divided into three stages. The problem of the first is to\nprove that reality is not exclusively matter. The problem of the\nsecond is to prove that reality is exclusively spirit. The problem of\nthe third is to determine what is the fundamental nature of spirit.\n(1901 [1934: 210 f.])\n\n\nAnd the last of his writings published in his lifetime (\u201cAn\nOntological Idealism\u201d) starts with the confession, explicitly\nemploying the same terminology that we have used here:\n\u201cOntologically I am an Idealist, since I believe that all that\nexists is spiritual\u201d (1924 [1934: 273]). He takes spirit to be\nthe sum total of individual spirits or selves connected by the\nrelation of love and bases this conviction on the claim that only this\nconception of what ultimate reality consists in allows us to overcome\nunavoidable contradictions connected with all other attempts to\nreconcile unity and diversity as the distinguishing marks of reality.\nHarmony between unity and diversity can be established only on the\nbasis of an all-encompassing relation of love between all the\ncharacteristic elements of reality, which in turn presupposes thinking\nof ultimate reality as a community of spirits or as Spirit.\nThese\u2014as McTaggart himself admits (1924 [1934: 271\nf.])\u2014rather mystical-sounding assertions, which he adhered to\nall his life, he tries to back up by a number of different\nconsiderations. In his earliest writing he relies heavily on views\nheld by Bradley to the effect that we have to accept that\ncontradictions are a criterion for non-reality. However, he does not\nemploy this criterion as a logical maxim but transforms it into an\nontological principle according to which everything that prevents\nharmony cannot be real. In his last work, his attempt to present an\nargument for his ontological idealism is based mainly on (1)\nmereological considerations concerning the structure of substances\nwhich aim to show that only spirits can claim the status of a\nsubstance, and on (2) his theory of time, the unreality of which he\nfamously had proven in his magnum opus The Nature of\nExistence (1921/27). In the first volume of this work he attempts\nto prove by a priori reasoning (NE \u00a743) that\nall that really exists are substances. Substances according to\nMcTaggart are infinitely divisible and therefore cannot have simple\nparts. Between substances and their individual features there obtains\na relation of determining correspondence such that each feature\ndetermines and is determined by all the other. Given these a\npriori characteristics of what can exist the task McTaggart\ntackles in the second volume is to \n\n\nconsider various characteristics as to which our experience gives us\n\u2026 a prima facie suggestion that they are possessed either by\nall that exists, or by some existent things (NE \u00a7295)\n\n\n\nand to ask \n\n \u201cwhich of these characteristics can really be possessed by\nwhat is existent\u201d and \n \u201cof those which are found to be possible characteristics of\nthe existent, whether any of them can be known to be actual\ncharacteristics of it\u201d (NE \u00a7295). \n\n\nThis double task cannot be settled by a priori means but has\nto be approached by starting from empirical assumptions based on\nexperience. If one has to acknowledge that the ways we are bound to\nconceive of all these experiential or phenomenal characteristics lead\nto contradictions then these characteristics cannot be true of\nreality. McTaggart\u2019s strategy here is strongly reminiscent of\nBradley\u2019s procedure to downgrade many phenomena to appearances\nand to deny them the status of constitutive elements of reality. The\nempirically given characteristics McTaggart discusses primarily are\n(a) time, (b) matter, (c) sensa, (d) spirit and (e) cogitation. As to\n(a) time he denies that \u201canything existent [can] possess the\ncharacteristic of being in time\u201d (NE \u00a7303) where\ntime is understood as an ordering relation between events. He\ndistinguishes between two ways of ordering in time. The first gives\nrise to what he calls the \u201cA-series\u201d according to which\nevery state of affairs (event, thing) is either past or present or\nfuture. The second, the so-called \u201cB-series\u201d, relates\ntransitively and asymmetrically states of affairs in terms of earlier\nand later (cf. NE \u00a7306). He claims that the A-series is\nmore fundamental than the B-series because only the A-series can\naccount for change (NE \u00a7317) and goes on to demonstrate\nthat (a) the A-series and the B-series contradict each other in the\nsense that they belong together though they are incompatible (cf.\nNE \u00a7333) and that (b) the (more fundamental) A-series\nleads to time determinations of a state of affairs that are\ncontradictory. The result: \n\n\nWe conclude that the distinctions of past, present and future are\nessential to time, and that, if the distinctions are never true of\nreality, then no reality is in time. (NE \u00a7324) \n\n\nThough never true of reality these distinctions are not empty because\naccording to McTaggart they have to be taken as appearances of a third\nseries, the C-series, \u201ca series which is not a time series, but\nunder certain conditions appears to us to be one\u201d. This C-series\n\u201cdoes actually exist in every case in which there is the\nappearance of a time-series\u201d (NE \u00a7347). McTaggart\nthinks of the C-series (at least in The Nature of Existence)\nas an \u201cInclusion Series\u201d (NE \u00a7575) \n\n\nwhose members are connected by the relations \u201cinclusive\nof\u201d and \u201cinclusive in\u201d, so that of any two terms one\nwill be inclusive of the other, and the other will be included in it.\n(NE \u00a7575) \n\n\nConcerning (b) matter which he characterizes as \u201csomething which\npossesses the primary qualities\u201d (NE \u00a7355) he also\nwants to prove that it does not exist (NE \u00a7364). This is\nso because all that exists are substances that have to be infinitely\ndivisible. Matter, however, \n\n\ncannot be divided into parts of parts to infinity either in respect of\nits spatial dimensions, or of that dimension which appears as\ntemporal. And matter, as usually defines, and as we have defined it,\nhas no other dimensions. \u2026 And therefore it cannot exist.\n(NE \u00a7362) \n\n\nThe existence of matter can also not be inferred on the basis of the\nprima facie existence of what I perceive \u201cby means of the sense\norgans of our bodies\u201d, i.e., of what he calls\n\u201csensa\u201d (NE \u00a7373), because it is erroneous\nto believe that matter as the presumed outside cause of a sensum has\nthe same qualities as a sensum and thus has to exist (NE\n\u00a7365). He conjectures that if there are outside causes of sensa\nthey must be substances which are \u201cof a spiritual nature\u201d\n(NE \u00a7371). When it comes to (c) sensa McTaggart holds\nthat one has to distinguish between two classes of percepta, those\nperceived by introspection (mental states, spiritual data) and those\nthat are given by means of sense organs (sensa). The latter do not\nreally exist, they just lead to the illusion that they exist. This is\nso because of a confusion between a perception that is part of the\npercipient and therefore spiritual or mental in character and what is\nperceived, i.e., the object of a perception or the perceptum\n(NE \u00a7373). However, a perceptum as a sensum cannot,\naccording to McTaggart, have parts within parts to infinity and thus\ncannot really exist because what exists has no simple parts (cf. 355).\nHaving disposed of matter and sensa this way, he then discusses the\nontological status of (d) spirit or spirituality. He declares that\n\u201cthe quality of spirituality \u2026 is the quality of having\ncontent, all of which is the content of one or more selves\u201d\n(NE \u00a7381) and states that \u201cnothing can have this\nquality except substances, and so nothing but substances are\nspiritual\u201d and exist or are real (ibid.). A self or an I he\ntakes to be a simple quality of a substance which is known to me to be\nmyself by direct perception, i.e., is known by acquaintance, not by\ndescription. The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description he explicitly takes up from Russell\n(NE \u00a7382). He then surmises that it is very likely that\nthe I, i.e., the substance that possesses the quality of being a self,\npersists through time because \u201cI perceive myself as persisting\nthrough time, or the real series which appears as a time-series\u201d\n(NE \u00a7395). He also holds that selves are conscious\nwithout having to be self-conscious (NE \u00a7397) and that\nno experience is possible \u201cwhich is not part of a self\u201d\n(NE \u00a7400) though it cannot belong to more than one self\n(NE \u00a7401). He concludes: \n\n\nAs all the content of spirit falls within some self, and none of it\nfalls within more than one self, it follows that all existent selves\nform a set of parts of that whole which consists of all existent\nspirits. (NE \u00a7404) \n\n\nAlthough written more than twenty years after G. E. Moore\u2019s\n\u201cThe Refutation of Idealism\u201d (see below) and without\nmentioning him at all, McTaggart thus arrives at the exact opposite to\nthe conclusion that Moore defended. Regarding (e) cogitations which\ncomprise perceptions, awarenesses of characteristics, judgments,\nassumptions, imaginings, only perceptions can form an infinite series\nrequired for existence (NE \u00a7406). Perception he\ncharacterizes as awareness of a substance as having such and\nsuch qualities (NE \u00a7407). The outcome he wants to have\nreached so far is this: \n\n\n\u2026 spirit, unlike matter and sense, can really exist. But it can\ndo so only if it contains no parts except perceptions and groups of\nperceptions. (NE \u00a7426) \n\n\nAll these considerations as to the character or the nature of time,\nmatter, sensa, spirit and cogitations are meant to establish two\nresults. The first is \u201cthat nothing which is spiritual is also\n\u201cmaterial or sensal\u201d (sic) [although this result]\nleaves it possible that what is really spiritual may appear\nas being material or sensal\u201d (NE \u00a7431). The second\nis McTaggart\u2019s version of idealism: \n\n\nNo substance has material or sensal qualities, and all reality is\nspirit. This conclusion I propose \u2026 to call by the name of\nIdealism (NE \u00a7432) \n\n\nin an ontological sense though, as he remarks, the terms\n\u201cSpiritualism\u201d or \u201cPsychism\u201d might be\n\u201cintrinsically better\u201d to characterize his point of view\n(NE \u00a7432). It is interesting to note that McTaggart does\nnot believe that his metaphysical (ontological) spiritual idealism\nexcludes a realistic stance in epistemology. This is so because he\ncharacterizes epistemological realism as a position that is based on a\ncorrespondence theory of truth according to which a belief is true if\nit corresponds to a fact. Because everything that is real is a fact\nand (according to McTaggart) nothing is unreal (although it may not\nexist), all beliefs about something are beliefs about facts and\nconsequently about something that is epistemologically real. Although\nthis concept of epistemological realism is vague, it suggests that\nMcTaggart thought of idealism not primarily in opposition to realism\nbut much more in terms of a doctrine that is opposed to materialism,\nthat is, as an ontological rather than epistemological doctrine.\nHowever, since McTaggart makes clear that since matter and mind are\nthe only candidates for genuine substantiality of which we\nknow, and thus that while only mind or spirit satisfies the\nontological conditions for substantiality, for all we know\nthere might be some other alternative, so his argument for idealism is\nnot conclusive. His argument is predominantly ontological, but does\npresuppose one crucial epistemological premise.\n\nIdealism was also a prominent mode of philosophy in the United States\nduring the late nineteenth century, alongside pragmatism, but while\npragmatism remained prominent throughout the twentieth century,\nwhether under that name or not, the reputation of idealism was\npermanently damaged by a movement toward \u201crealism\u201d early\nin the century (which also attacked pragmatism, although without the\nsame effect). Earlier in the nineteenth century, the popular essayist\nRalph Waldo Emerson, the most philosophical of the New England\n\u201cTranscendentalists\u201d, had struck many idealist themes, and\nafter the Civil War a school of \u201cSt. Louis Hegelians\u201d\nemerged, whose efforts were primarily exegetical. But the leading\nAmerican idealist was Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916). Deeply\ninfluenced by Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly the lectures that\nPeirce gave in Cambridge in 1898, Royce incorporated aspects of\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatism into his version of idealism, giving an\nidealist spin to Peirce\u2019s conception of truth as what would be\nknown at the end of inquiry were that ever to be reached. But\nRoyce\u2019s argument always remained that epistemology must\nultimately lead to what he himself called metaphysical idealism.\n\nA prolific author who published fifteen books before his early death\nat sixty, Royce launched his defense of idealism in his first book,\nThe Religious Aspect of Philosophy (1885). In this work he\nintroduced his first novel argument, for idealism, what he called the\nargument from error. Royce\u2019s claim is that skepticism begins\nwith insistence upon the possibility of error, but that recognition of\nthat possibility presupposes not just that there is\n\u201cabsolute truth\u201d (1885: 385) but that in some sense we\nhave to know that absolute truth, or at least some aspect of\nit, in order to have an object even for our erroneous claims, thus\nthat we must have some access to a \u201chigher inclusive\nthought\u201d even to make an erroneous knowledge claim. In his\nwords,\n\n\nEither then there is no error, or else judgments are true and false\nonly in reference to a higher inclusive thought, which they\npresuppose, and which must, in the last analysis, be assumed as\nInfinite and all-inclusive. (1885: 393)\n\n\nRoyce holds that we must have some sort of apprehension of the\n\u201chigher inclusive thought\u201d in order to be able even to\nmake our errors, and then that the growth of human knowledge over time\nconsists in increasing apprehension of this all-inclusive truth\nwithout any limit being prescribed by our subordinate status. This is\nthe epistemological optimism that pervades all Royce\u2019s work and\nhis subsequent debate with Bradley.\n\nThis account does not yet make clear why Royce thought that\nepistemology must lead to ontological idealism; that becomes clearer\nin his subsequent works. Royce\u2019s next major statement of his\nidealism came in The Spirit of Modern Philosophy (1892). The\nsecond part of the book more fully develops Royce\u2019s own\narguments for idealism. Here Royce gives a clear definition of his\nconception of idealism and adds to the previous argument from error a\nsecond argument, from meaning. The core of this argument is that the\nintended object of an expression or thought must itself be conceived\nor understood in some way, so that we always mean what are in some\nsense our own ideas, although of course at any particular moment we\nhardly know or understand everything about the object to which we\nrefer; that is why the idea that is the ultimate object of reference\nmay be much greater than the idea that refers. In Royce\u2019s\nwords,\n\n\nThe self that is doubting or asserting, or that is even feeling its\nprivate ignorance about an object, and that still, even in consequence\nof all this, is meaning, is aiming at such an\nobject, is in essence identical with the self for which this object\nexists in its complete and consciously known truth. (1892:\n370\u20131)\n\n\nBy means of this argument, any restriction of Royce\u2019s position\nto a purely epistemological one is eliminated: the possibility of\nmeaning requires an identity between what means and what is meant, and\nsince anything might be meant, anything at all must in some way be\nidentical with what means, subjects and their ideas and expressions,\neven though that identity can hardly be absolute, and the ordinary\nconscious subject may seem very different and more limited than the\n\u201cone Self\u201d (1892: 373) that underlies the\nappearances of both ordinary subjects and ordinary objects.\n\nRoyce develops an even more systematic argument for an idealism that\nis both epistemological and ontological in his magnum opus,\nthe two volumes of his 1899\u20131900 Gifford lectures published as\nThe World and the Individual. As the title suggests, a major\ntheme of this work is explicating in detail the relationship between\nunderlying reality and ordinary individual, conscious human selves. In\nthis book, Royce expounds his idealism as the last of the four\npossible \u201cconceptions of being\u201d. The first is the\n\u201crealistic conception of Being\u201d, which is defined by the\nconception of being as completely independent of thought, so\nthat whatever is true of it is true quite independently of what may be\nthought about it. The second conception of being is the mystical\nconception. As the defining notion of the realist conception was\nindependence, the defining notion of mysticism is the opposite, namely\nimmediacy, the idea that thought and its object must be one. The third\nconception of being, which Royce sometimes calls the theory of\n\u201cvalidity\u201d, is that \u201cTo be real now means,\nprimarily, to be valid, to be true, to be in essence the standard\nfor ideas\u201d (I:202). This conception of being tries to\nretain realism\u2019s recognition of independence through the thought\nthat \u201csome of my ideas are already, and apart from my private\nexperience, valid, true, well-grounded\u201d (I:204) and\nmysticism\u2019s identification of subject and object through the\nthought that reality is itself possible experience, but adds structure\nto the now unified realms of thought and being instead of eliminating\nstructure.\n\nThe fourth conception of being is a fuller development of the\nconception of meaning that Royce had introduced in The Spirit of\nModern Philosophy (1892). He now links meaning to purpose, and\nhis thought is that the meaning of a term is an intended purpose, a\nproblem to be solved, for example a mathematical problem to be solved\nor object to be constructed, and that in using a term the user already\nhas some approach to solving the problem in mind but the full solution\nremains to be developed, may never be fully developed in the life of a\nparticular individual, but is in some sense already included in the\nlarger thought that constitutes reality. Reaching back to both Hegel\nand Kant, Royce conceives of the progress of knowledge as making the\nmeaning of our ideas more determinate. In this he is also influenced\nby Peirce, and his notion of meaning is clearly a version of\nPeirce\u2019s approach to truth, on which a proposition is true if it\nwould be affirmed at the final stage of human inquiry, with the\ndifference that while for Peirce the final stage of human enquiry is\nessentially a regulative ideal without ontological commitment, for\nRoyce, the comprehensive meaning in which all ideas would be fully\ndeterminate is actually thought, although by a sort of super-self, not\nby any particular finite human self or even by all the selves thinking\nat any one time. Royce makes the transition from thought to being by\nstating that\n\n\nIn its wholeness the world of Being is the world of individually\nexpressed meanings, an individual life, consisting of the individual\nembodiments of the wills represented by all finite ideas. (1892:\nI:341\u20132)\n\n\nRoyce\u2019s arguments for idealism collectively, which in many ways\nreturn to the basic form of modern idealism pioneered by Green, whose\nProlegomena had been published just a couple of years before\nRoyce\u2019s own career began, illustrate the pressure that often\nforced a move from epistemology to an idealist ontology. The\nepistemological argument begins with the insight that our knowledge in\nsome way or another always reflects the structure of our own\nconsciousness and thought. But the difference between what any\nparticular individual believes or even knows at any particular time\nand what may be true and be known as a whole, at a time or over time,\nis too great to ignore, and must be resolved. But once it has been\nassumed that thought or mind itself is the proper object of knowledge,\nthe only way to do this is to make a contrast between individual\nthought and some sort of supra-individual thought. At the outset of\nmodern idealism, in Berkeley, that takes the form of the infinite\nmind, God, contrasted to individual, human minds; in later forms, such\nas those of Green and Royce, the supra-individual mind is not always\nidentified with God, but plays the same role. In the cases of both\nGreen and Royce, the union of epistemology and ontology also provided\nthe basis for a moral idealism based on an insistence upon the\nunderlying commonality of individual human selves in the larger self\nthat Royce called the Absolute. But we will not be able to trace that\nline of thought here, and will instead conclude with the suggestion\nthat many subsequent philosophers drew back from the full-blooded\nidealism offered by Green, Bradley, McTaggart, and Royce in favor of\nwhat was supposed to be an ontological realism, but which nevertheless\ncontinued to harbor at least epistemological grounds for idealism.\nThis might seem a surprising claim, since the immediate response both\nto the British idealists and to Royce in the U.S. came from\nphilosophers who identified themselves as realists. A case in point\nwould be Bertrand Russell.\n\nBefore we turn to Russell, however, we will pause for a look at\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914), who, as already suggested,\nwas a considerable influence on the later work of Royce. Whereas Royce\nwas convinced that epistemology must ultimately lead to metaphysical\nidealism, Peirce was led in his philosophical development from\nmetaphysical realism to metaphysical idealism while supporting all the\nway what has here been characterized as an epistemological ground for\nidealism. Peirce, definitely the most original American philosopher of\nhis era, was the son of a famous Harvard mathematician. He was a fired\nfrom a teaching post at Johns Hopkins because he had the temerity to\nbegin residence with the woman who would become his second wife before\nhis divorce from his first wife had been finalized, and was never able\nto get another academic position. He thus had to spend much of his\ncareer as an employee of United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and\nthen lived his final years in independent but dire circumstances,\nsupported in part by subscription lecture series that William James\narranged for him to give in Cambridge. Although he was highly\nrecognized and even supported by many of his academically much more\nsuccessful philosophical contemporaries, among them Royce and James,\nand although he produced an impressive amount of writing (the Peirce\nEdition Project that is in charge of publishing his writings will, if\never finished, contain more than twenty volumes) he never succeeded in\nelaborating his ideas in book form. Instead he published most of his\nwork in intellectual and learned journals (Proceedings der\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences, Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy, The Nation, Popular Science, The Monist, The Open\nCourt) and encyclopedias (Baldwin\u2019s The Century\nDictionary and Cyclopedia). There are also quite a number of\nmanuscripts he wrote for different lecture series but never published.\nThey comprise the early Harvard lectures on The Logic of\nScience (1865) and the early Lowell Lectures on the same topic\n(1866) as well as the Cambridge Lectures on Reasoning and the\nLogic of Things (1898) and the later Harvard lectures on\nPragmatism (1903).\n\nPeirce\u2019s metaphysical view are intimately connected with his\nclaim \u201cthat logic is the science of representations in general,\nwhether mental or material\u201d (Chronological Edition =\nCE 1.169) and with his stipulations concerning the structure\nand status of what he calls \u201crepresentation\u201d. In his early\nwritings, while trying to answer the question as to the grounds of the\nobjective validity of synthetic inferences (a question which he takes\nto be at the center of Kant\u2019s theoretical philosophy), he\ndevelops a notion of representation according to which \n\n\n[A] representation is anything which is supposed to stand for another\nand which might express that other to a mind which truly could\nunderstand it. (CE 1.257) \n\n\nThis characterization of a representation is supposed to make the\nrepresentation \u201cmind-independent\u201d, so to speak: \n\n\ninstead of being restricted to something within the mind, [the\nrepresentation] is extended to things which do not even address the\nmind. (CE 1.323) \n\n\nPeirce might have come to this conception of a representation by\nrelying on a phenomenological analysis of what he takes to be\nconstitutive of every experience. For him \n\n\nexperience has three determinations\u2014three different references\nto a substratum or substrata, lying behind it and determining it.\n(CE 1.168) \n\n\nThis is so because every experience is determined (1) by an external\nobject, (2) by our soul and (3) by \u201cthe idea of a universal\nmind\u201d (an \u201carchetypal idea\u201d). Within representations\nhe distinguishes in the early writings between a copy (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose agreement with its object depends merely upon\nsameness of predicates\u201d, CE 1.257), a sign (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose reference to its object is fixed by\nconvention\u201d, CE 1.257) and a symbol (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose correspondence with its object is of the same\nimmaterial kind as a sign but is founded nevertheless in its very\nnature\u201d CE 1.323). Later he changed the terminology and\nused instead of \u201ccopy\u201d and \u201csign\u201d the terms\n\u201cIcon\u201d and \u201cIndex\u201d, which led to his better\nknown distinction between Icon, Index and Symbol as different kinds of\nrepresentations. Each of these different kinds is determined by a\ndifference in its way of denoting and/or connoting its object while\nall of them share the characteristics of having to have (1) a relation\nto an object (2) under a specific form (e.g., similarity, by\nconvention) and (3) a relation to an interpretant, i.e., to a\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d (cf. CE 1.272 f.). From his\nanalysis of the nature of a representation Peirce draws the\nmetaphysical conclusion that \u201c[w]hatever is is a\nrepresentation\u201d (CE 1.324) or \u201call is\nrepresentation\u201d (CE 1.326). He arrives at this\nconclusion in a somewhat obscure way that seems to be based on the\nconviction that everything there is represents itself or is a\nrepresentation of itself under an interpretation. Peirce does\nnot immediately recognize his position as a form of idealism. Rather,\nbecause representations are neutral with respect to their status of\nbeing material or mental he can think of material objects as\nrepresentations whose interpretant is either the representation itself\nor some (non-human) consciousness for which the representation can\nfunction as a symbol, and he can think of mental items like general\nterms or concepts as universals that exist \u201cout there\u201d in\na world that comprises next to copies and conventional signs what he\ncalls ideas (cf. CE 1.168). However, it is obvious that this\nview commits Peirce to a position that implies the (metaphysical)\nreality of universals, a position he explicitly and happily endorses\n(cf. CE 1.358 ff.). And the very fact that every\nrepresentation has both a denotative and a connotative function makes\nthe basic epistemological premise for idealism, namely the necessary\nisomorphism between knowledge and the known, an element of his\nview.\n\nWhereas in his earlier writings Peirce is very explicit about the\nmetaphysical/ontological implications of his representational\nposition, he is reluctant to go into metaphysical discussions in his\nlater writings, where he is primarily concerned with formulating and\ndefending his conception of Pragmatism. Instead he urges that his\nPragmatism is not a metaphysical doctrine and is in fact\nmetaphysically neutral. In a draft of a popular article on Pragmatism\n(1907), never published in his lifetime, he writes \n\n\nthat pragmatism is, in itself, no doctrine of metaphysics, no attempt\nto determine any truth of things. It is merely a method of\nascertaining the meanings of hard words and of abstract concepts.\n(The Essential Peirce = EP 2.400) \n\n\nHe proclaims, most unambiguously in his Harvard lectures on\nPragmatism (1903), that one can establish Pragmatism as a\nmethodological maxim on the basis of epistemological (in later years:\nsemiotic) considerations that have to start from a phenomenological\nanalysis of experience. To provide this analysis is the task of what\nhe calls Phenomenology (used explicitly in allusion to Hegel, cf.\nEP 2.143 f.) which is in Peirce\u2019s taxonomy the first of\nthe main branches of philosophy because on it rest what he takes to be\nthe other branches of philosophy, i.e., normative science and\nmetaphysics (cf. EP 2.146 f.). Phenomenology is the\ndiscipline \n\n\nwhose task is to make out what are the elements of appearance that\npresent themselves to us every hour and every minute whether we are\npursuing earnest investigations, or are undergoing the strangest\nvicissitudes of experience, or are dreamily listening to the tales of\nScheherazade. (EP 2.147) \n\n\nAccording to Peirce, phenomenological considerations, i.e.,\nconsiderations spelled out in the Phenomenology, show that in whatever\ncan be experienced there are at least two distinct series of\ncategories involved that make this experience possible. Some of them\nare universal, i.e., are constitutive of every phenomenon, others\nparticular, i.e., belong to a phenomenon if looked at under a specific\naspect (cf. EP 2.148) like its quantitative, qualitative,\nrelational etc. determinations. As universal categories he identifies\nthree which he names Firstness/Category the First/First,\nSecondness/Category the Second/Second, and Thirdness/Category the\nThird/Third respectively. He defines them thus: \n\n\nCategory the First is the Idea of that which is such as it is\nregardless of anything else. That is to say, it is a Quality\nof Feeling. Category the Second is the Idea of that which is such as\nit is as being Second to some First, regardless of anything else and\nin particular regardless of any law, although it may conform\nto a law. That is to say, it is Reaction as an element of the\nPhenomenon. Category the Third is the Idea of that which is such as it\nis as being a Third, or Medium, between a Second and its First. That\nis to say, it is Representation as an element of the\nPhenomenon. (EP 2.160) \n\n\nThese definitions are meant to capture what is essential to every\nphenomenon. They are interpreted in more familiar terms by Peirce as\nattributing to every phenomenon the characteristics of presentness or\nimmediacy (Firstness), struggle or resistance (Secondness) and what\nmay be described as general openness to conceptual interpretation\n(Thirdness) as fundamental and irreducible features. Peirce is ready\nto credit Hegel with a similar view (\u201cI consider Hegel\u2019s\nthree stages as being, roughly speaking, the correct list of Universal\nCategories\u201d, EP 2.148). However, he criticizes Hegel\nfor mistakenly not allowing these categories to be independent of each\nother. He believes that the reason for this failure on Hegel\u2019s\npart lies in his being \n\n\npossessed with the idea that the Absolute is One. \u2026\nConsequently, he wishes to make out that the three categories have not\ntheir several independent and irrefutable standings in thought.\nFirstness and Secondness must somehow be aufgehoben.\n(EP 2.177) \n\n\nAlthough this criticism might be justified from a Peircean\nphenomenological point of view it poses at the same time a problem for\nhim because he now has to give an account of how the professed\nindependence of his universal categories can be integrated into his\ngeneral representational picture of reality, a picture according to\nwhich everything that is real has to have the character of Thirdness\nand therefore is somehow related to everything else in virtue of its\ninterpretative or representational character, i.e., in virtue of its\nstatus as an interpretant.\n\nIt looks as if Peirce in his later years (after ca. 1905) tried to\nsolve this problem by giving his phenomenological claims a\nmetaphysical underpinning. For him metaphysics is that part of\nphilosophy that gives an account of the results of what\nphilosophy in the form of Phenomenology and as a normative science has\naccomplished. Here Peirce exploits the fundamental idealist premise\nthat there is a necessary isomorphism between thought and being:\naccording to him, \n\n\n[m]etaphysics consists in the results of the absolute acceptance of\nlogical principles not merely as regulatively valid, but as truths of\nbeing. Accordingly, it is to be assumed that the universe has an\nexplanation, the function of which, like that of every logical\nexplanation, is to unify its observed variety. It follows that the\nroot of all being is One; and so far as different subjects have a\ncommon character they partake of an identical being. This, or\nsomething like this, is the monadic clause of the law. Second, drawing\na general induction from all observed facts, we find all realization\nof existence lies in opposition, such as attractions, repulsions,\nvisibilities, and centres of potentiality generally\u2026. This is,\nor is a part of, a dyadic clause of the law. Under the third clause,\nwe have, as a deduction from the principle that thought is the mirror\nof being, the law that the end of being and highest reality is the\nliving impersonation of the idea that evolution generates.\n(CP 1.487) \n\n\nThe term \u201claw\u201d in this characterization is equivalent to\nwhat he terms \u201cregularity\u201d \u201cin the universe of\nrepresentations\u201d (cf. CP 1.480). The specific\nversion of metaphysics he is advocating shows up in his writings in\nthe shape of what he calls his doctrine of Synechism. He\ndefines Synechism as \n\n\nthat tendency of philosophical thought which insists upon the idea of\ncontinuity as of prime importance in philosophy and, in particular,\nupon the necessity of hypotheses involving true continuity. (Collected\nPapers = CP 6.169) \n\n\nThis synechistic doctrine, he declares, \n\n\ngives room for explanations of many facts which without it are\nabsolutely and hopelessly inexplicable; and further that it carries\nalong with it the following doctrines: first, a logical realism of the\nmost pronounced type; second, objective idealism; third, tychism, with\nits consequent thorough-going evolutionism. We also notice that the\ndoctrine presents no hindrances to spiritual influences, such as some\nphilosophies are felt to do. (CP 6.163) \n\n\nTychism \u201cor the doctrine that absolute chance is a factor of the\nuniverse\u201d (CP 6.201) he takes to be an essential\nelement of synechistic philosophy because it \n\n\nmust give birth to an evolutionary cosmology, in which all the\nregularities of nature and of mind are regarded as products of growth,\nand to a Schelling-fashioned idealism which holds matter to be mere\nspecialized and partially deadened mind. (CP 5.102) \n\n\nHe is committed to objective idealism as well as to logical realism\nbecause of his view that (to use a phrase favored very much by\nBradley) \u201cin the end\u201d everything there is is a\nrepresentation. It is within this synechistic framework based on\ntychism that, according to Peirce, the independence of Firstness and\nSecondness can be shown to be a necessary condition for Thirdness.\nThis is so because continuity (which he identifies with Thirdness) and\nchance (as the organizing principle of evolution) could not be\naccounted for if there were no independence of the three universal\ncategories. He is very explicit about this connection between his\nmetaphysical and his representational views when he writes: \n\n\nPermit me further to say that I object to having my metaphysical\nsystem as a whole called Tychism. For although tychism does enter into\nit, it only enters as subsidiary to that which is really, as I regard\nit, the characteristic of my doctrine, namely, that I chiefly insist\nupon continuity, or Thirdness, and, in order to secure to Thirdness\nits really commanding function, I find it indispensable fully [to]\nrecognize that it is a third, and that Firstness, or chance, and\nSecondness, or Brute reaction, are other elements, without the\nindependence of which Thirdness would not have anything upon which to\noperate. Accordingly, I like to call my theory Synechism, because it\nrests on the study of continuity. (CP 6.202) \n\n\nIn virtue of the robust idealistic elements contained in his synechism\nit is safe to say that Peirce\u2019s final philosophy exhibits all\nthe traits that are characteristic of metaphysical idealism prevalent\nin Anglo-American philosophy at the turn of the twentieth century.\n",
