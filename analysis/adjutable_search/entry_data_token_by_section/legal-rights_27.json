    "main_text": "Features Salient to Legal Rights || Imperfect Rights\n10.4 Remedial Rights and Rights of Action\n\nCharacteristic to legal rights and certainly of rights in private law,\nis a two-tiered system of interrelated norms\u2014primary and\nsecondary (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 100\u2013104; Paton 1972: 487).\nPrimary norms grant rights and impose correlative duties. Following\nlaw\u2019s ancient maxim that \u201cwhere there is a right, there is\na remedy\u201d (ubi jus, ibi remedium) (Blackstone\n1765\u20139: 23; Goldberg 2005: 531\u201359; Goldberg & Zipursky\n2020: 25\u201351, 82\u2013110), when a primary right is violated law\ntypically provides right-holders with a right to recourse (Stevens\n2011: 133\u2013134; Gardner 2019: 18\u201319) or, at the very least,\nwith a right of action to pursue recourse against the wrongdoer\n(Zipursky 1998; Smith 2012: 1727\u20131728; Goldberg & Zipursky\n2020: 98\u2013103).\n\nRemedies can take the form of enforcement of the violated (primary)\nright, either through self-help, policing, or a court order. Yet,\nenforcement is sometimes less favored, impossible, impractical,\ninequitable, or too costly. If so, law typically provides victims of\nrights violations with secondary rights, which are remedial rights\ngrounded in the violation of the primary right. Secondary rights are\ntypically for restitution of unjust gains or for compensation for the\nviolation of a primary right and for resulting deprivations and\nproximate losses. Secondary rights are normally accompanied or\npreceded by rights of action to pursue their enforcement through the\nmechanism of the state (Paton 1972: 487\u2013493). Importantly,\nremedial rights and rights of action against the party who violated a\nprimary right, and are typically held exclusively by the party who\nheld that right (Zipursky 1998: 4). \n\nThe intricacy of secondary and, more broadly, of remedial rights in\nthe law, far exceeds anything found in moral theory. Moreover, lacking\ninstitutions of adjudication and enforcement, morality does not\nobviously involve formalized straightforward rights of action to\npursue recourse for rights violation.\n",
