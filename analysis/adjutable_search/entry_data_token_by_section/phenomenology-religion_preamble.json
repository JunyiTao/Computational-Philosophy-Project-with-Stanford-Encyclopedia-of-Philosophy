    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry examines the relevance of phenomenological considerations\nfor the concept of God (or the sacred otherwise characterised) and the\nquestion of what sort of rational sense is implied in the adoption of\na religious point of view. The discussion distinguishes various\nperspectives on the subjective character of religious experience, and\nexamines the relation between religious experience and experience of\nthe material world. It also considers the interaction between\nexperience, conceptual framework (including religious doctrine) and\npractice, and the contribution, if any, of emotional feelings to the\nepistemic significance of religious experience. In all of these ways,\nan appreciation of the \u201cphenomenology of religion\u201d proves\ncentral to an understanding of what is involved practically,\ncognitively and affectively in a religious way of life.\n",
