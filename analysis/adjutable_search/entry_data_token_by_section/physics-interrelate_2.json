    "main_text": "Hierarchies of Theories\n3. Hierarchies of Theories\n\n\nDespite the fact that limiting relations between theories may be\nsingular in this way, it is (at times) useful and appropriate to think\nof physical theories as forming a hierarchy related by length or\nenergy scales. The idea is that different theories may apply at\ndifferent length or energy scales. If one takes this idea seriously,\nthen it may very well be the case that each theory in this hierarchy\nwill be phenomenological relative to those theories at higher energies\nor shorter distances. Equivalently, such a hierarchy may form a tower\nof effective theories. An effective theory is one that\ndescribes the relevant phenomena in a circumscribed domain\u2014a\ndomain characterized by a range of energies, for example.\nThe idea of effective theories is not new. In the 19th century and\nearlier, scientists developed continuum equations such as the\nNavier-Cauchy equations describing the behavior of isotropic elastic\nsolids and the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous\nfluids. These equations were, and still are, remarkably safe. This\nmeans that once one inputs the appropriate values for a few\nphenomenological parameters (such as Young\u2019s modulus and the sheer\nstress in the Navier-Cauchy equations), one arrives at equation models\nthat allow us to build bridges and buildings that do not collapse. It\nis remarkable that a theory/model that almost entirely fails\nto refer to the details of the atomic and molecular structure of a\nsteel beam, say, can be so successful and safe. A question of deep\nphilosophical interest concerns how this can be the case. The\nphenomenological parameters must encode at least some details about\nthe atomic and molecular make up of the beam. (Hence, the \u201calmost\u201d in\nthe statement above.) \n\nHowever, this raised an important question: Can one tell a story\nbridging the models at the atomic scale and those at the continuum\nscale of centimeters and greater? Reductionists typically believe\nthat it is possible to connect, and presumably to derive, the\ncontinuum models starting from atomic scale details. There has been a\nbattle for two centuries, at least, between those who are persuaded that\nsuch a bottom-up story can be told, and those such as Duhem, Mach, and\nothers who have championed a top-down modeling strategies. In the 19th\ncentury this took the form of a heated dispute between so-called\nrari-constancy and multi-constancy theorists who, respectively, tried\nto determine the continuum equations from top-down (ignoring unknown\nmicro details) considerations, and theorists trying to determine the\ncontinuum equations with small scale atomic assumptions guiding the\nconstructions. In fact, surprisingly, the former\nprevailed. (Todhunter and Pearson 1960; Batterman 2012) \nThe debate between bottom-up, reductionist modelers and top-down,\ncontinuum modelers receives its modern presentation, at least in part,\nin the debates about the existence and nature of emergent phenomena.\nOne area of recent interest where this occurs is in our understanding\nof effective quantum field theories.\nIn quantum field theory, for instance, there has been considerable\nsuccess in in showing how a theory appropriate for some range of\nenergy scales is related to a theory for another range via a process\nof renormalization (Bain 2012). Renormalization provides a kind of limiting\nrelationship between theories at different scales despite the fact\nthat the reductive Schema R typically fails because\nof divergences related to singular limits. The physics at one scale\nis relatively independent of that at some higher energy (shorter\nlength). In effect, renormalization is a mathematical scheme for\ncharacterizing how the structure of interactions changes with changing\nscale: it turns out that the domain characterized by some lower energy\n(or larger length) scale is surprisingly and remarkably decoupled from\nthat of higher energies (or smaller lengths). In other words, the\ndecoupling entails that the higher energy regime does not much effect\nthe behaviors and character of the lower energy regimes.\n\nNew work, more generally on the problem modeling systems at widely\ndifferent scales (10+ orders of magnitude), in nano chemistry and in\nmaterials science, brings some hope that the all-or-nothing dichotomy\nbetween reduction and emergence can be somewhat blunted. As noted, a\nquestion of real philosophical interest concerns how to understand the\nrelative autonomy of theories and models at large scales. (Why, again,\nare the continuum equations so safe for large scale modeling?)\nContemporary work in applied mathematics on so-called homogenization\ntheory is beginning to provide interesting connections across these\nwidely separated scales. (Torquato 2002; Phillips 2001)\n\nThe mathematics of renormalization is best understood as an instance\nof this general strategy for homogenization or upscaling. (Batterman\n2012) It is crucial for a contemporary understanding of relations\nbetween theories. It is fair to say, however, that being able to\nunderstand such intertheoretic relations via homogenization and\nrenormalization techniques does not entail the existence of reductive\nrelations between the theories either in the philosophers\u2019 or\nthe physicists\u2019 sense of the term. However, such an\nunderstanding may very well lead to a more nuanced and precise\ncharacterization of the debates about reduction and emergence.\n",
