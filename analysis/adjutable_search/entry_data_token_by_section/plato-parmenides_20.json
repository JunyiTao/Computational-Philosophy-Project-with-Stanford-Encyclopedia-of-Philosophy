Within D8, there are two\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is not, then none\nof the others is one (D8A1C1), the others are not many (D8A1C2), the\nothers cannot be conceived to be either one or many (D8A2C).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D8 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The lone\nexception is D8A2C, which depends on none of the Conclusions\nestablished in previous Deductions. (For details, see Rickless\n(2007, 236\u2013238).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D8 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first seven Deductions, the Arguments of D8 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1. Again,\nit appears that most of the premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s\npoint of view, either definitionally true or just plain obvious.\nThus it appears that, from Plato\u2019s point of view, D8 establishes,\nwithout reliance on Purity-F or any other potentially problematic\nassumption, that if the one is not, then the others are, at the very\nleast, neither one nor many.\n\n\nTaken together, D7 and D8 establish that the one is. For D7A2\nshows that if the one is not, then the others are many. But D8A1\nshows that if the one is not, then the others are not many. Thus\nD7 and D8 show that if the one is not, then the others have\ncontradictory properties. Given that nothing can have\ncontradictory properties, it follows directly that the one is.\nThis reinforces the result previously established in section 6.7.\n",
