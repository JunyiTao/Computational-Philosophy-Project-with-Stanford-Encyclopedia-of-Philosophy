    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society\n4. Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society\n\nJustice as fairness is Rawls\u2019s theory of justice for a liberal\nsociety. As a member of the family of liberal political conceptions of\njustice it provides a framework for the legitimate use of political\npower. Yet legitimacy is only the minimal standard of moral\nacceptability; a political order can be legitimate without being just.\nJustice sets the maximal standard: the arrangement of social\ninstitutions that is morally best.\n\nRawls constructs justice as fairness around specific interpretations\nof the ideas that citizens are free and equal, and that society should\nbe fair. He sees it as resolving the tensions between the ideas of\nfreedom and equality, which have been highlighted both by the\nsocialist critique of liberal democracy and by the conservative\ncritique of the modern welfare state. Rawls also argues that justice\nas fairness is superior to the dominant tradition in modern political\nthought: utilitarianism.\n\nIn Rawls\u2019s egalitarian liberalism, citizens relate to each other\nas equals within a social order defined by reciprocity, instead of\nwithin the unjust status hierarchies familiar from today.\n\n\nSignificant political and economic inequalities are often associated\nwith inequalities of social status that encourage those of lower\nstatus to be viewed both by themselves and by others as inferior. This\nmay arouse widespread attitudes of deference and servility, on one\nside, and a will to dominate and arrogance on the other. These effects\nof social and economic inequalities can be serious evils and the\nattitudes they engender great vices... Fixed status ascribed by birth,\nor by gender or race, is particularly odious (JF, 131).\n\n",
