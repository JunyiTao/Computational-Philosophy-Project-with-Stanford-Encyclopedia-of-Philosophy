    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe late fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. saw many important\ndevelopments in Greek mathematics, including the organization of basic\ntreatises or elements and developments in conceptions of proof, number\ntheory, proportion theory, sophisticated uses of constructions\n(including spherical spirals and conic sections), and the application\nof geometry and arithmetic in the formation of other sciences,\nespecially astronomy, mechanics, optics, and harmonics. The authors of\nsuch treatises also began the process of creating effective methods of\nconceiving and presenting technical work, including the use of letters\nto identify parts of diagrams, the use of abstract quantities marked by\nletters in proofs instead of actual numerical values, and the use of\nproofs. We cannot know whether Aristotle influenced the authors of\ntechnical treatises or merely reflects current trends.\n\n\nIn this context, Plato's Academy was fertile ground for controversy\nconcerning how we are to know mathematics (the sorts of principles, the\nnature of proofs, etc.) and what the objects known must be if the\nscience is to be true and not vacuous. Aristotle's treatments of\nmathematics reflect this diversity. Nonetheless, Aristotle's reputation\nas a mathematician and philosopher of mathematical sciences has often\nwaxed and waned.\n\n\nIn fact, Aristotle's treatises display some of the technically most\ndifficult mathematics to be found in any philosopher before the\nGreco-Roman Age. His technical failures involve conceptually difficult\nareas involving infinite lines and non-homogenous magnitudes.\n\n\nCommentators on Aristotle from the 2nd century on tended to\ninterpret Aristotle's mathematical objects as mental objects, which\nmade Aristotle more compatible with neo-Platonism. Later the\nmechanistic movement in the late Renaissance treated Aristotle as\ndivorcing mathematics from physical sciences in order to drive a deeper\nwedge between their views and his. Because of this, it has been very\neasy to discount Aristotle as subscribing to a version of psychologism\nin mathematics. These tendencies contribute to the common view that\nAristotle's views mathematics are marginal to his thought. More\nrecently, however, some sympathetic readers have seen Aristotle as\nexpressing a fictionalist version of physicalism, the view that the\nobjects of mathematics are fictional entities grounded in physical\nobjects. To the extent that this view is regarded as a plausible view\nabout mathematics, Aristotle has regained his position.\n\n\nThere are two important senses in which Aristotle never presents a\nphilosophy of mathematics. Aristotle considers geometry and arithmetic,\nthe two sciences which we might say constitute ancient mathematics, as\nmerely the two most important mathematical sciences. His explanations\nof mathematics always include optics, mathematical astronomy,\nharmonics, etc. Secondly, Aristotle, so far as we know, never devoted a\ntreatise to philosophy of mathematics. Even Metaphysics xiii\nand xiv, the two books devoted primarily to discussions of the nature\nof mathematical objects, are really concerned with diffusing Platonist\npositions that there are immutable and eternal substances over and\nbeyond sensible substances and Pythagorean positions that identify\nnumbers with sensible substances.\n",
