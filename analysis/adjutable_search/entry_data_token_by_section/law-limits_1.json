    "main_text": "Legal Moralism: Restrictive Factors that Can Defeat Prima Facie Wrongs || Privacy\n2.1 Privacy\n\nThe defeating factors most heavily stressed by Devlin and Moore are\nprivacy and liberty (Devlin 1965: 16\u201320; Moore 1997:\n76\u201378). As far as privacy is concerned, consider adultery and\nfornication. Adultery remains a criminal offence in parts of the world\nincluding certain US states (Rhode 2016). Devlin takes the\nwrongfulness of adultery for granted, but nevertheless holds it\ninappropriate to criminalize it. Jeffrie Murphy reaches the same\nconclusion despite saying, along the same lines as Devlin:\n\n\nIt does not strike me as absurd\u2026to suggest that the sexual\nrevolution of the 60s, and the resulting freedom many men felt to\nabandon their marriages and family responsibilities for sexual and\nother forms of so-called self-fulfilment, generated considerable\nsocial harm\u2014particularly for women and children. (J. Murphy 2006\n[2012: 70])\n\n\nFrom considerations like this there may be a prima facie\nground to criminalize in some circumstances such moral wrongs, but the\nconduct\u2014all things considered\u2014should not be criminal in\nDevlin\u2019s view or Murphy\u2019s. The clumsy tool of legal\ncoercion is hardly likely to help remedy any wrongs here, not to\nmention the undesirability of official surveillance of intimate\nrelationships.\n\nThe privacy concerns defeat any prima facie right. A legal\nmoralist position must attend closely to what is known about the\npotential effects on privacy of the criminal law. Such a view would\nfind pertinent Lawrence Tribe\u2019s suggestion as to what the\nquestion should be in Bowers v Hardwick\u2014that is: not\nthe question of what Hardwick \u201cwas doing in the privacy of his\nbedroom, but what the State of Georgia was doing there\u201d (quoted\nin Suk 2009a:\n 689).[4]\n More recently Jeannie Suk has explored the relationship between the\ncriminal law and the value of privacy and intimate relationships.\nThough not writing from any self-declared legal moralist perspective\nthe ideas illustrate the kind of balanced exploration that the legal\nmoralist seeks. The criminal law in many\njurisdictions\u2014Suk\u2019s focus is largely on New York\nCounty\u2014showed, historically, a reluctance to enter the intimate\nspace of the home at the heavy cost of enabling domestic abuse against\nwomen. This has been replaced in many jurisdictions, such as New York\nCounty, by the criminalization in various guises of domestic abuse. An\nimprovement to be sure. However, Suk points to some complex resulting\ntensions \u201cbetween protecting women from intimate violence\u201d\nand respecting their \u201cself-determination\u201d (Suk 2009a:\n690). Certain criminal law techniques, such as protection orders that\nseek the end of an intimate relationship can amount, she claims, to\n\u201cstate-imposed de facto divorce\u201d (Suk 2009a: 685; 2009b)\nand to various contexts in which \u201cthe particular desires of\nindividual women\u201d do not \u201ccontrol\u201d a particular area\nof their intimate lives (Suk 2009a: 690). Suk\u2019s aim is not to\ndeny that the criminal law should be used to criminalize and enforce\nspecific laws against domestic abuse; the wrong (and harm) of domestic\nabuse remains a ground for such intervention. It is rather to focus on\nthe delicate balances implied by legal enforcement of such wrongdoing\nagainst the value of privacy, intimacy, and self-determination and to\nevaluate certain specific legal techniques in the light of such a\nfocus. It has led to numerous responses (see Suk 2009a, which contains\nreactions from eight commentators; on domestic abuse see also Friedman\n2003, Dempsey 2009).\n\nThis approach to privacy is not one accepted by all legal moralists.\nThe usual two-part structure of legal moralism\u2014the wrongs and\nthe countervailing factors\u2014was noted above. Devlin and Moore\ntreat privacy as a potentially defeating countervailing factor, an\naspect of the second part of that structure as we have just seen.\nDuff, however, treats it as a criterion to determine what counts as a\nwrong before even reaching the question of countervailing factors, in\nother words as an aspect of the first part of that structure. For\nDuff, the criminal law is, or should be, limited to the definition and\ndeclaration of public wrongs; wrongness, for him, \u201cis a\nreason for criminalization\u2014but only if it is committed within\nthe public realm\u201d (Duff 2018: 100). In insisting on this, Duff\nis departing from Devlin\u2019s claim:\n\n\nthat it is not possible to set theoretical limits to the power of the\nState to legislate against immorality. It is not possible to settle in\nadvance exceptions to the general rule or to define inflexibly areas\nof morality into which the law is in no circumstances to be allowed to\nenter. (Devlin 1965: 12\u201313)\n\n\nThe \u201cprivate realm\u201d for Duff\u2014which he aspires to\ndefine in advance, albeit not \u201cinflexibly\u201d\u2014is\nprecisely an area of morality into which the (criminal) law is not to\nbe allowed to enter.\n",
