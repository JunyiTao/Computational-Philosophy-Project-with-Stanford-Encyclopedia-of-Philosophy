    "main_text": "Moral Responsibility\n3. Moral Responsibility\n\nA philosophically informed empirical research program akin to the one\njust described is more than a methodological fantasy. This approach\naccurately describes a number of research programs aimed at informing\nphilosophical debates through interdisciplinary research.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this kind of work was inspired in\nlarge part by the work of Knobe (2003a,b, 2006) and addressed\nquestions surrounding \u201cfolk morality\u201d on issues ranging\nfrom intentional action to causal responsibility (see Knobe 2010 for\nreview and discussion). This early work helped to spur the development\nof a truly interdisciplinary research program with both philosophers\nand psychologists investigating the folk morality of everyday life.\n(See the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on\nExperimental Moral Philosophy for a more complete treatment of this\nresearch.)\n\nAnother related philosophical debate concerns the compatibility of\nfree will and moral responsibility with determinism. On the one hand,\nincompatibilists insist that determinism (the view that all events are\njointly determined by antecedent events as governed by laws of\nnature), is incompatible with moral responsibility.\nTypically, these accounts also go on to specify what particular\ncapacity is required to be responsible for one\u2019s own behavior\n(e.g., that agents have alternate possibilities for behavior, or are\nthe \u201cultimate\u201d source of their behavior, or both (Kane\n2002: 5; Haji 2002:\n 202\u20133).[7]\n On the other hand, compatibilists argue that determinism and\nresponsibility are compatible, often by denying that\nresponsible agency requires that the actor have genuinely open\nalternatives, or rejecting the ultimacy condition that requires\nindeterminism (or impossible demands for self-creation). In short,\ncompatibilists hold that people may legitimately be held responsible\neven though there is some sense in which they \u201ccould not have\ndone otherwise\u201d or are not the \u201cultimate source\u201d of\ntheir behavior. Incompatibilists deny that this is the case.\nProponents of these two opposing positions have remained relatively\nentrenched, and some participants have raised fears of a\n\u201cdialectical stalemate\u201d (Fischer 1994: 83\u20135).\n\nA critical issue in these debates has been the claim that the\nincompatibilist position better captures folk moral judgments about\nagents whose actions have been completely determined (e.g., G.\nStrawson 1986: 88; Smilansky 2003: 259; Pereboom 2001: xvi;\nO\u2019Connor 2000: 4; Nagel 1986: 113, 125; Campbell 1951: 451; Pink\n2004: 12). For example, Robert Kane (1999: 218; cf. 1996: 83\u20135),\na leading incompatibilist, reports that in his experience \u201cmost\nordinary persons start out as natural incompatibilists\u201d, and\n\u201chave to be talked out of this natural incompatibilism by the\nclever arguments of philosophers\u201d.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some compatibilists have been quick to assert the\ncontrary. For example, Peter Strawson (1982) famously argued that in\nthe context of \u201cordinary interpersonal relationships\u201d,\npeople are not haunted by the specter of determinism; such\nmetaphysical concerns are irrelevant to their experience and\nexpression of the \u201creactive attitudes\u201d\u2014anger,\nresentment, gratitude, forgiveness, and the like\u2014associated with\nresponsibility assessment. Any anxiety about determinism, Strawson\ninsisted, is due to the \u201cpanicky metaphysics\u201d of\nphilosophers, not incompatibilist convictions on the part of ordinary\npeople. However, incompatibilists have historically been thought to\nhave ordinary intuitions on their side; even some philosophers with\ncompatibilist leanings are prepared to concede the incompatibilist\npoint about \u201ctypical\u201d response tendencies (e.g., Vargas\n2005a,b).\n\nNeither side, so far as we are aware, has offered much in the way of\nsystematic evidence of actual patterns of folk moral judgments.\nRecently however, a now substantial research program has begun to\noffer empirical evidence on the relationship between determinism and\nmoral responsibility in folk moral judgments.\n\nInspired by the work of Frankfurt (1988) and others, Woolfolk, Doris,\nand Darley (2006) hypothesized that observers may hold actors\nresponsible even when the observers judge that the actors could not\nhave done otherwise, if the actors appear to \u201cidentify\u201d\nwith their behavior. Roughly, the idea is that the actor identifies\nwith a behavior\u2014and is therefore responsible for it\u2014to the\nextent that she \u201cembraces\u201d the behavior, or performs it\n\u201cwholeheartedly\u201d regardless of whether genuine\nalternatives for behavior are\n possible.[8]\n Woolfolk et al.\u2019s suspicion was, in effect, that people\u2019s\n(presumably tacit) theory of responsibility is compatibilist.\n\nTo test this, subjects were asked to read a story about an agent who\nwas forced by a group of armed hijackers to kill a man who had been\nhaving an affair with his wife. In the \u201clow\nidentification\u201d condition, the man was described as being\nhorrified at being forced to kill his wife\u2019s lover, and as not\nwanting to do so. In the \u201chigh identification\u201d condition,\nthe man is instead described as welcoming the opportunity and wanting\nto kill his wife\u2019s lover. In both cases, the man is not given a\nchoice, and does kill his wife\u2019s lover.\n\nConsistent with Woolfolk and colleagues\u2019 hypothesis, subjects\njudged that the highly identifying actor was more responsible, more\nappropriately blamed, and more properly subject to guilt than the low\nidentification\n actor.[9]\n This pattern in folk moral judgments seems to suggest that\nparticipants were not consistently incompatibilist in their\nresponsibility attributions, because the lack of alternatives\navailable to the actor was not alone sufficient to rule out such\nattributions.\n\nIn response to these results, those who believe that folk morality is\nincompatibilist may be quick to object that the study merely suggests\nthat responsibility attributions are influenced by identification, but\nsays nothing about incompatibilist commitments or the lack thereof.\nSubjects still may have believed that the actor could have done\notherwise. To address this concern, Woolfolk and colleagues also\nconducted a version of the study in which the man acted under the\ninfluence of a \u201ccompliance drug\u201d. In this case,\nparticipants were markedly less likely to agree that the man\n\u201cwas free to behave other than he did\u201d and yet they still\nheld the agent who identified with the action as more responsible than\nthe agent who did not. These results look to pose a clear challenge to\nthe view that ordinary folk are typically incompatibilists.\n\nA related pattern of responses was obtained by Nahmias, Morris,\nNadelhoffer and Turner (2009) who instead described agents preforming\nimmoral behaviors in a \u201cdeterministic world\u201d of the sort\noften described in philosophy classrooms. One variation read as\nfollows:\n\n\nImagine that in the next century we discover all the laws of nature,\nand we build a supercomputer which can deduce from these laws of\nnature and from the current state of everything in the world exactly\nwhat will be happening in the world at any future time. It can look at\neverything about the way the world is and predict everything about how\nit will be with 100% accuracy. Suppose that such a supercomputer\nexisted, and it looks at the state of the universe at a certain time\non March 25th, 2150 C.E., twenty years before Jeremy Hall is born. The\ncomputer then deduces from this information and the laws of nature\nthat Jeremy will definitely rob Fidelity Bank at 6:00 PM on January\n26th, 2195. As always, the supercomputer\u2019s prediction is\ncorrect; Jeremy robs Fidelity Bank at 6:00 PM on January 26th,\n2195.\n\n\nSubjects were then asked whether Jeremy was morally blameworthy. Most\nsaid yes, indicating that they thought an agent could be morally\nblameworthy even if his behaviors were entirely determined by natural\nlaws. Consistent with the Woolfolk et al. results, it appears that the\nsubjects\u2019 judgments, at least those having to do with moral\nblameworthiness, were not governed by a commitment to\nincompatibilism.\n\nThis emerging picture was complicated, however, by Nichols and Knobe\n(2007), which argued that the ostensibly compatibilist responses were\nperformance errors driven by an affective response to the\nagents\u2019 immoral actions. To demonstrate this, all subjects were\nasked to imagine two universes\u2014a universe completely governed by\ndeterministic laws (Universe A) and a universe (Universe B) in which\neverything is determined except for human decisions which are not\ncompletely determined by deterministic laws and what has happened in\nthe past. In Universe B, but not Universe A, \u201ceach human\ndecision does not have to happen the way it does\u201d. Some\nsubjects were assigned to a concrete condition, and asked to make a\njudgment about a specific individual in specific circumstances, while\nothers were assigned to an abstract condition, and asked to make a\nmore general judgment, divorced from any particular individual. The\nhypothesis was that the difference between these two conditions would\ngenerate different responses regarding the relationship between\ndeterminism and moral responsibility. Subjects in the concrete\ncondition read a story about a man, \u201cBill\u201d, in the\ndeterministic universe who murders his wife and children in a\nparticularly ghastly manner, and were asked whether Bill was morally\nresponsible for what he had done. By contrast, subjects in the\nabstract condition were asked \u201cIn Universe A, is it possible for\na person to be fully morally responsible for their actions?\u201d\nSeventy-two percent of subjects in the concrete condition gave a\ncompatibilist response, holding Bill responsible in Universe A,\nwhereas less than fifteen percent of subjects in the abstract\ncondition gave a compatibilist response, allowing that people could be\nfully morally responsible in the deterministic Universe A.\n\nIn line with previous experimental work demonstrating that increased\naffective arousal amplified punitive responses to wrongdoing (Lerner,\nGoldberg, & Tetlock 1998), Nichols and Knobe hypothesized that\npreviously observed compatibilist responses were the result of the\naffectively laden nature of the stimulus materials. When this\naffective element was eliminated from the materials (as in the\nabstract condition), participants instead exhibited an incompatibilist\npattern of responses.\n\nMore recently, Nichols and Knobe\u2019s line of reasoning has come\nunder fire from two directions. First, a number of studies have now\ntried to systematically manipulate how affectively arousing the\nimmoral behavior performed is, but have not found that these changes\nsignificantly alter participants\u2019 judgments of moral\nresponsibility in deterministic scenarios. Rather, the differences\nseem to be best explained simply by whether the case was described\nabstractly or concretely (see Cova et al. 2012 for work with patients\nwho have frontotemporal dementia, and see Feltz & Cova 2014 for a\nmeta-analysis). Second, a separate line of studies from Murray and\nNahmias (2014) argued that participants who exhibited the apparently\nincompatibilist pattern of responses were making a critical error in\nhow they understood the deterministic scenario. In particular, they\nargued these participants mistakenly took the agents, or their mental\nstates, in these deterministic scenarios to be \u201cbypassed\u201d\nin the causal chain leading up to their behavior. In support of their\nargument, Murray and Nahmias (2014) demonstrated that when analyses\nwere restricted to the participants who clearly did not take the agent\nto be bypassed, these participants judged the agent to be morally\nresponsible (blameworthy, etc.) despite being in a deterministic\nuniverse. Unsurprisingly, this line of argument has, in turn, inspired\na number of further counter-responses, both empirical (Rose &\nNichols 2013) and theoretical (Bj\u00f6rnsson & Pereboom 2016),\nwhich caution against the conclusions of Murray and Nahmias.\n\nWhile the debate continues over whether the compatibilist or\nincompatibilist position better captures folk moral judgments of\nagents in deterministic universes, a related line of research has\nsprung up around what is widely taken to be the most convincing\ncontemporary form of argument for incompatibilism: manipulation\narguments (e.g., Mele 2006, 2013, Pereboom 2001, 2014).\nPereboom\u2019s Four-Case version, for example, begins with the case\nof an agent named Plum who is manipulated by neuroscientists who use a\nradio-like technology to change Plum\u2019s neural states, which\nresults in him wanting and then deciding to kill a man named White. In\nthis case, it seems clear that Plum did not freely decide to kill\nWhite. Compare this case to a second one, in which the team of\nneuroscientists programmed Plum at the beginning of his life in a way\nthat resulted in him developing the desire (and making the decision)\nto kill White. The incompatibilist argues that these two cases do not\ndiffer in a way that is relevant for whether Plum acted freely, and\nso, once again, it seems that Plum did not freely decide to kill\nWhite. Now compare this to a third case, in which Plum\u2019s desire\nand decision to kill White were instead determined by his cultural and\nsocial milieu, rather than by a team of neuroscientists. Since the\nonly difference between the second and third case is the particular\ntechnological process through which Plum\u2019s mental states were\ndetermined, he would again seem to not have freely decided to kill\nWhite. Finally, in a fourth and final case, Plum\u2019s desire and\ndecision to kill White was determined jointly by the past states and\nthe laws of nature in our own deterministic universe. Regarding these\nfour cases, Pereboom argues that, since there is no difference between\nany of the four cases that is relevant to free will, if Plum was not\nmorally responsible in the first case, then he was not morally\nresponsible in the fourth.\n\nIn response to this kind of manipulation-based argument for\nincompatibilism, a number of researchers have taken aim at painting a\nbetter empirical picture of ordinary moral judgments concerning\nmanipulated agents. This line of inquiry has been productive on two\nlevels. First, a growing number of empirical studies have investigated\nmoral responsibility judgments about cases of manipulation, and now\nprovide a clearer psychological picture for why manipulated agents are\njudged to lack free will and moral responsibility. Second, continuing\ntheoretical work, informed by this empirical picture, has provided new\nreasons for doubting that manipulation based arguments actually\nprovide evidence against compatibilism.\n\nOne line of empirical research, led by Chandra Sripada (2012) has\nasked whether manipulated agents are perceived to be unfree because\n(a) they lack ultimate control over their actions (a capacity\nincompatibilists take to be essential for moral responsibility) or\ninstead because (b) their psychological or volitional capacities (the\ncapacities focused on by compatibilists) have been damaged. Using a\nstatistical approach called Structural Equation Modeling (or SEM),\nSripada found that participants\u2019 moral responsibility judgments\nwere best explained by whether they believed the psychological and\nvolitional capacities of the agent were damaged by manipulation and\nnot whether the agent lacked control over her actions. This finding\nsuggests that patterns of judgment in cases of manipulation are more\nconsistent with the predictions of compatibilism than with\nincompatibilism.\n\nTaking a different approach, Phillips and Shaw (2014) demonstrated\nthat the reduction of moral responsibility that is typically observed\nin cases of manipulation depends critically on the role of an\nintentional manipulator. In particular, ordinary people were\nshown to distinguish between (1) the moral responsibility of agents\nwho are made to do a particular act by features of the situation they\nare in (i.e., situational determinism), and (2) the moral\nresponsibility of agents who are made to do that same act by another\nintentional agent (i.e., manipulation). This work suggests that the\nordinary practice of assessing freedom and responsibility is likely to\nclearly distinguish between cases that do and do not involve a\nmanipulator who intervenes with the intention of causing the\nmanipulated agent to do the immoral action. A series of studies by\nMurray and Lombrozo (2016) further elaborates these findings by\nproviding evidence that the specific reduction of moral responsibility\nthat results from being manipulated arises from the perception that\nthe agent\u2019s mental states are bypassed.\n\nCollectively, two lessons have come out of this work on the ordinary\npractice of assessing the moral responsibility of manipulated agents:\n(1) folk morality provides a natural way of distinguishing between the\ndifferent cases used in manipulation-based arguments (those that do\ninvolve the intentional intervention of a manipulator vs. those that\ndon\u2019t) and (2) folk morality draws an intimate link between the\nmoral responsibility of an agent and that agent\u2019s mental and\nvolitional capacities. Building on this increasingly clear empirical\npicture, Deery and Nahmias (2017) formalized these basic principles in\ntheoretical work that argues for a principled way of distinguishing\nbetween the moral responsibility of determined and manipulated\nagents.\n\nWhile the majority of evidence may currently be in favor of the view\nthat folk morality adheres to a kind of \u201cnatural\ncompatibilism\u201d (Cova & Kitano 2013), this remains a\ncontentious topic, and new work is continually emerging on both sides\nof the debate (Andow & Cova 2016; Bear & Knobe 2016;\nBj\u00f6rnsson 2014; Feltz & Millan 2013; Figdor & Phelan\n2015; Knobe 2014). One thing that has now been agreed on by parties on\nboth sides of this debate, however, is a critical role for careful\nempirical studies (Bj\u00f6rnsson & Pereboom 2016; Knobe 2014;\nNahmias 2011).\n",
