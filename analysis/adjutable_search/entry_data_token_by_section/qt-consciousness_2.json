    "main_text": "Quantum Brain\n3. Quantum Brain\n\nIn this section, some popular approaches for applying quantum theory\nto brain states will be surveyed and compared, most of them\nspeculative, with varying degrees of elaboration and viability.\n Section 3.1\n addresses three different neurophysiological levels of description,\nto which particular quantum approaches refer. Subsequently, the\nindividual approaches themselves will be discussed \u2014\n Section 3.2:\n Stapp,\n Section 3.3:\n Vitiello and Freeman,\n Section 3.4:\n Beck and Eccles,\n Section 3.5:\n Penrose and Hameroff. \n\nIn the following, (some of) the better known and partly worked out\napproaches that use concepts of quantum theory for inquiries into the\nnature of consciousness will be presented and discussed. For this\npurpose, the philosophical distinctions A/B\n (Section 2)\n and the neurophysiological distinctions addressed in\n Section 3.1\n will serve as guidelines to classify the respective quantum\napproaches in a systematic way. However, some preliminary\nqualifications concerning different ways to use quantum theory are in\norder.\n\nThere are quite a number of accounts discussing quantum theory in\nrelation to consciousness that adopt basic ideas of quantum theory in\na purely metaphorical manner. Quantum theoretical terms such\nas entanglement, superposition, collapse, complementarity, and others\nare used without specific reference to how they are defined precisely\nand how they are applicable to specific situations. For instance,\nconscious acts are just postulated to be interpretable\nsomehow analogously to physical acts of measurement, or correlations\nin psychological systems are just postulated to be\ninterpretable somehow analogously to physical entanglement. Such\naccounts may provide fascinating science fiction, and they may even be\nimportant to inspire nuclei of ideas to be worked out in detail. But\nunless such detailed work leads beyond vague metaphors and analogies,\nthey do not yet represent scientific progress. Approaches falling into\nthis category will not be discussed in this contribution.\n\nA second category includes approaches that use the status quo\nof present-day quantum theory to describe neurophysiological and/or\nneuropsychological processes. Among these approaches, the one with the\nlongest history was initiated by von Neumann in the 1930s, later taken\nup by Wigner, and currently championed by Stapp. It can be roughly\ncharacterized as the proposal to consider intentional conscious acts\nas intrinsically correlated with physical state reductions. Another\nfairly early idea dating back to Ricciardi and Umezawa in the 1960s is\nto treat mental states, particularly memory states, in terms of vacuum\nstates of quantum fields. A prominent proponent of this approach at\npresent is Vitiello. Finally, there is the idea suggested by Beck and\nEccles in the 1990s, according to which quantum mechanical processes,\nrelevant for the description of exocytosis at the synaptic cleft, can\nbe influenced by mental intentions.\n\nThe third category refers to further developments or\ngeneralizations of present-day quantum theory. An obvious\ncandidate in this respect is the proposal by Penrose to relate\nelementary conscious acts to gravitation-induced reductions of quantum\nstates. Ultimately, this requires the framework of a future theory of\nquantum gravity which is far from having been developed. Together with\nPenrose, Hameroff has argued that microtubuli might be the right place\nto look for such state reductions. \n",
