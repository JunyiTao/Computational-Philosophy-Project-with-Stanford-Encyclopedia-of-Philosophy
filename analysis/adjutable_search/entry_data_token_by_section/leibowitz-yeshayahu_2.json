    "main_text": "Life and Works || Methodology\n1.2 Methodology\n\nIn the 1953 piece \u201cMitzvot Ma\u2019asiyot\u201d (a\nlater version of which was translated as \u201cReligious\nPraxis,\u201d in Judaism), at once the most succinct\nstatement of his philosophy and his most expansive essay that\nforeshadows much of what he would go on to write throughout his\ncareer, Leibowitz tells us that he is not concerned to\n\u201celaborate a philosophic justification or rationale for the\nMitzvoth [commandments],\u201d but instead to expand on \u201ctheir\nmeaning for Jewish religion as we live it\u201d (Judaism,\n4). Indeed, while some of Leibowitz\u2019s ideas are certainly drawn\nfrom (and relevant to) the philosophy of religion more generally, his\nwritings are very specifically directed to giving a philosophical\nexposition of Judaism, and in particular of the mitzvoth that are at\nits heart. \u201cExposition\u201d may, however, appear to be a\nmisleading term to use given that the earliest published Hebrew\nversion of this piece opens with some introductory methodological\nremarks \u201cdesigned to guide the argument,\u201d in which he\nstates that argument \u201cand not exposition \u2013 should\nbe the main point of our discussion,\u201d (Torah u-Mitzvot,\n 9).[3]\n Leibowitz\u2019s mixed signals here \u2013 talk of expanding on\n\u201cmeaning\u201d suggests a more hermeneutical and expository\napproach, and yet he wishes to eschew \u201cexposition\u201d for\nargument \u2013 indicate important limits on what Leibowitz sets out to\nachieve.\n\nGiven his scientific training, Leibowitz \u201cargues\u201d on the\nbasis of empirical (most often historical) evidence for certain\nfactual claims regarding, for example, the centrality of mitzvoth in\nJudaism to the exclusion of mysticism, philosophy, or dogma. Yet, on\nthe very same positivistic grounds, he is not willing to launch\nparallel \u201carguments\u201d in order to justify specific\npractices or indeed Jewish practice as a whole (though this is a topic\nto which we will have cause to return). Leibowitz helps himself to a\nstark fact/value distinction, insisting that \u201cValues are not\nanchored in reality\u201d (Judaism, 139); that there is\n\u201cno relation of connection or mutual dependence between\nscientific cognition and evaluative decision\u201d (Mada,\n7). Thus, if one is expecting to find an argument justifying the\nhalakhic way of life through syllogistic reasoning from foundational\nprinciples, or justifications of the commandments in the manner of the\ngreat medieval Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, one is likely to\nbe disappointed. What we do find, in line with much contemporary\nJewish philosophy, is an insider\u2019s account of the meaning of\nfaith in Judaism as understood from within that tradition, albeit with\nimplications beyond those boundaries. And for Leibowitz, such\n\u201cmeaning\u201d is aligned with the purposes and values we\nespouse, such that at times he uses the expression \u201cvalue and\nmeaning\u201d, or some variation of it, as if it were a single\nsyntactic unit (see Judaism, 135\u2013138, for example) As\nLeibowitz notes when discussing Aristotelian science, two people\nlooking at the same things and agreed on all of the material facts and\n\u201cefficient causes\u201d can nonetheless attach very different\nmeanings to the phenomena in question when they introduce the\nperspective of their final causes (Mada, 27). So while facts\nare relevant to his factual claims about the nature of Judaism, it is\nto values and purposes that we must turn if we are to fully understand\nmeaning, and the meaning of the faith of Judaism cannot therefore be\njustified by appeal to the world of scientific cognition. At the same\ntime, in contrast to some of the best-known twentieth century Jewish\nphilosophers, Leibowitz is also wary of any appeal to religious\nexperience to further his account of the meaning of Jewish faith.\n\u201cMost characteristic of the Halakhah,\u201d he tells us,\n\u201cis its lack of pathos\u201d (Judaism, 13). The only\nreliable tools that we can use in order to investigate the meaning of\nthis evaluative notion of faith, therefore, remain those of discursive\nreasoning. Thus we generally find Leibowitz using the tools of\nrational philosophical discourse to trace the implications of his\nfoundational positions to their logical conclusions.\n\nRather than setting out his philosophy comprehensively in the form of\na system based on foundational premises, Leibowitz generally wrote\nshort articles devoted to specific topics. It is nonetheless fair to\nsay that there is a single axis around which his philosophy of Judaism\nrevolves and to which many of his views can ultimately be\ntraced \u2013 the radical transcendence of God. In what follows we will\nbegin with Leibowitz\u2019s understanding of God\u2019s\ntranscendence, which will enable us to proceed to his conceptions of\ntheology, Scripture, Jewish faith, ethics, and briefly politics, all\nof which ultimately wend their way back to that fundamental idea.\nWhile occasionally developments and changes in his thought will be\nnoted, particularly in the political section, on the whole we will be\ndealing with his mature views since, as Hannah Kasher has argued, in\nthe 1992 English translations to which most readers of this will have\naccess, even the earlier essays have been translated in a manner that\noften reflects the later views (Kasher, 2000, 54).\n",
