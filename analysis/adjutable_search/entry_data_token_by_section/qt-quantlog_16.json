Indeed,\nsuch talk is readily accommodated in the present formalism.[13]\n In the approach we have been pursuing, a physical system is\nrepresented by a probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\), and the\nsystem\u2019s states are identified with the probability weights in\n\\(\\Delta\\). Classically, any subset \\(\\Gamma\\) of the\nstate-space \\(\\Delta\\) corresponds to a categorical property of the\nsystem. However, in quantum mechanics, and indeed even classically,\nnot every such property will be testable (or \u201cphysical\u201d).\nIn quantum mechanics, only subsets of the state-space corresponding to\nclosed subspaces of the Hilbert space are testable; in classical\nmechanics, one usually takes only, e.g., Borel sets to correspond to\ntestable properties: the difference is that the testable properties in\nthe latter case happen still to form a Boolean algebra of sets, where\nin the former case, they do not.\n\nOne way to frame this distinction is as follows. The support\nof a set of states \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq \\Delta\\) is the set \n\n\\[S(\\Gamma) = \\{x\\in X \\mid \\exists \\omega \\in \\Gamma \\omega(x) > 0 \\}\\]\n\n\nof outcomes that are possible when the property \\(\\Gamma\\) obtains.\nThere is a sense in which two properties are empirically\nindistinguishable if they have the same support: we cannot distinguish\nbetween them by means of a single execution of a single test. We might\ntherefore wish to identify physical properties with classes of\nphysically indistinguishable classical properties, or, equivalently,\nwith their associated supports. However, if we wish to adhere to the\nprogramme of representing physical properties as subsets (rather than\nas equivalence-classes of subsets) of the state-space, we can do so,\nas follows. Define a mapping \\(F : \\wp(X) \\rightarrow \\wp(\\Delta)\\) by\n\\(F(J) = \\{\\omega \\in \\Delta \\mid S(\\omega) \\subseteq J \\}\\). The\nmapping \\(\\Gamma \\rightarrow F(S(\\Gamma))\\) is then a closure\noperator on \\(\\wp(\\Delta)\\), and the collection of closed sets\n(that is, the range of \\(F)\\) is a complete lattice of sets, closed\nunder arbitrary\n intersection.[14]\n Evidently, classical properties\u2014subsets of\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u2014have the same support iff they have the same closure,\nso we may identify physical properties with closed subsets of the\nstate-space:\n\n\n4.4 Definition:\n\nThe property lattice of the model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) is\nthe complete lattice \\(\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\)\nof all subsets of \\(\\Delta\\) of the form \\(F(J), J\\) any set of\n outcomes.[15]\n\n\n\nWe now have two different \u201clogics\u201d associated with a probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) with \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) algebraic: a\n\u201clogic\u201d \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) of experimental propositions\nthat is an orthoalgebra, but generally not a lattice, and a\n\u201clogic\u201d \\(\\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) of properties\nthat is a complete lattice, but rarely orthocomplemented in any\nnatural way (Randall and Foulis [1983]). The two are connected by a\nnatural mapping [\u00a0] : \\(\\Pi \\rightarrow \\mathbf{L}\\), given by\n\\(p \\rightarrow[p] = F(J_p)\\) where for each \\(p\\in \\Pi\\), \\(J_p =\n\\{x\\in X \\mid p(x) \\nleq p' \\}\\). That is, \\(J_p\\) is the set of\noutcomes that are consistent with \\(p\\), and [\\(p\\)] is the largest\n(i.e., weakest) physical property making \\(p\\) certain to be confirmed\nif tested.\n\nThe mapping \\(p \\rightarrow[p\\)] is order preserving. For both the\nclassical and quantum-mechanical models considered above, it is in\nfact an order-isomorphism. Whenever this is the case, \\(\\Pi\\) will\ninherit from \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) the structure of a complete lattice, which\nwill then automatically be orthomodular by Lemma 4.3. In other words,\nin such cases we have only one logic, which is a complete\northomodular lattice. While it is surely too much to expect that [ ]\nwill be an order-isomorphism every conceivable physical\nsystem\u2014indeed, we can easily construct toy examples to the\ncontrary\u2014the condition is at least reasonably transparent in its\nmeaning.\n",
