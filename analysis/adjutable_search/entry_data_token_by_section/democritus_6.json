    "main_text": "Ethics\n7. Ethics\n\nThe reports concerning Democritus\u2019 ethical views pose a number of\ninterpretative problems, including the difficulty of deciding which\nfragments are genuinely Democritean (see above, section 1). In\ncontrast to the evidence for his physical theories, many of the\nethical fragments are lists of sayings quoted without context, rather\nthan critical philosophical discussions of atomist views. Many seem\nlike commonsense platitudes that would be consistent with quite\ndifferent philosophical positions. Thus, despite the large number of\nethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of\nhis ethical views. Annas notes the Socratic character of a number of\nthe sayings, and thinks there is a consistent theme about the role of\none\u2019s own intellect in happiness (Annas 2002). The sayings contain\nelements that can be seen as anticipating the more developed ethical\nviews of Epicurus (Warren 2002).\n\nIt is also a matter of controversy whether any conceptual link can be\nfound between atomist physics and the ethical commitments attributed\nto Democritus. Vlastos argued that a number of features of Democritus\u2019\nnaturalistic ethics can be traced to his materialist account of the\nsoul and his rejection of a supernatural grounding for ethics (Vlastos\n1975). Taylor is more sceptical about the closeness of the connection\nbetween Democritus\u2019 ethical views and his atomist physics (Taylor\n1999a, pp. 232\u20134).\n\nThe reports indicate that Democritus was committed to a kind of\nenlightened hedonism, in which the good was held to be an internal\nstate of mind rather than something external to it (see Hasper 2014).\nThe good is given many names, amongst them euthymia or\ncheerfulness, as well as privative terms, e.g. for the absence of\nfear. Some fragments suggest that moderation and mindfulness in one\u2019s\npursuit of pleasures is beneficial; others focus on the need to free\noneself from dependence on fortune by moderating desire. Several\npassages focus on the human ability to act on nature by means of\nteaching and art, and on a notion of balance and moderation that\nsuggests that ethics is conceived as an art of caring for the soul\nanalogous to medicine\u2019s care for the body (Vlastos 1975, pp.\n386\u201394). Others discuss political community, suggesting that\nthere is a natural tendency to form communities.\n",
