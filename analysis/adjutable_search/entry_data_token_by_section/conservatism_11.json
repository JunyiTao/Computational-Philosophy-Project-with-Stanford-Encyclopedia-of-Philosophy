Communitarian critique\n\nAs we saw, conservatives have conflicting responses towards\nestablished power that arises from revolution. Non-relativistic\nconservatives\n (1.4 above)\n always rejected the Soviet system, no matter how long it endured, and\ncontinue to reject Chinese communism. They do not regard these as\n\u201ctraditions\u201d in the manner of long-standing,\norganically-evolving institutions such as English Common Law.\nRelativistic conservatives, in contrast, might accept these systems,\nif they endure for long enough. Thus Oakeshott in Rationalism in\nPolitics refers to the Russian tradition of autocracy,\nperpetuated by the Bolshevik revolution; it is not \u201cgood\u201d\nor \u201cbad\u201d tradition, but the only one that Russia knows. On\nhis view, it seems, tradition is inescapable, and societies rather\nrigid. \n\nGordon Graham argues that conservatives cannot consistently\n\u201creject\u201d revolutionary regimes. Their ideology\n\u201c[cannot] avoid connivance with evil\u201d, and is recommended\n\u201conly when conditions are reasonably, and perhaps unusually,\ngood\u201d:\n\n\nTrue conservatism is a decidedly English doctrine with little\nappeal\u2026in other countries [because] only English and hence\nBritish institutions have ever been decent enough to allow a decent\n[person] to be conservative. (Graham 1986: 188\u20139)\n\n\nGraham\u2019s conclusion, that the state is not an \u201cinstrument\nof salvation\u201d, and we should have \u201cno very high\nexpectations of politics\u201d, is\u2014despite what he\nsuggests\u2014itself a conservative view (1986: 189). However, a\nconservative response to totalitarianism is quietist\npessimism\u2014not \u201cconnivance with evil\u201d, but realism in\nthe face of it. As conservatives such as Burke supported the 1688\nRevolution, so they should support the non-violent uprisings of\n1989.\n\nModern communitarians such as MacIntyre and Sandel misinterpret\nconservatives when they condemn liberal individualism for abandoning\nthe notion of tradition to the Burkeans, whose concept of it is\n\u201cstatic\u201d when it should be\n\n\nliving tradition [as] a historically extended, socially embodied\nargument\u2026in part about the goods which constitute a tradition.\n(MacIntyre, 2007: 222)\n\n\nFor MacIntyre, we find meaning for our lives through what he calls\ntraditional \u201cnarratives\u201d; modes of thought that help us to\nreason and make moral judgements, and so we are not as free to reason\nor act as liberal cosmopolitans believe (2007: 205). Communitarians\nsuch as MacIntyre criticise modern thinkers \u201cexcept for Newman\nin theology, and perhaps Coleridge who influenced him\u201d for\nfailing to develop a theory of the rationality of traditions. (We saw\nthat Burke regarded tradition and individual reason as contradictory\nprinciples, but may have endorsed a notion of collective reason\n(Beveridge and Turnbull 1997).) \n\nTo reiterate, this is a misinterpretation of conservatism.\nConservatives would respond that Burke\u2019s concept of tradition is not\nstatic, and does stress the importance of incremental change; while\nOakeshott, like MacIntyre, has an interrogative attitude to tradition.\nMoreover, the communitarian opposition to liberal values is limited,\nand does not extend to advocacy of religious intolerance and\nhomogeneity or patriarchal authority (see Taylor 1977; Waldron\n1992)\u2014though neither does the anti-liberalism of Burkean\nconservatives. It could be argued that since the conservative\ntradition is older, and more substantial, than communitarianism, the\nliberal-conservative debate is more fundamental than the\nliberal-communitarian one; \u201ccommunitarianism\u201d is a mixture\nof liberalism and conservatism. (But see Skorupski 2015, on\n\u201cliberal communitarianism\u201d). (A further consideration is\nthat traditional methods may not always yield the most practical\nresponses (Scott 1998: 331).)\n",
