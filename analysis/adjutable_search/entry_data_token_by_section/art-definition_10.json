    "main_text": "Contemporary Definitions || Hybrid (Disjunctive) Definitions\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nConventionalist definitions account well for modern art, but have\ndifficulty accounting for art\u2019s universality \u2013 especially\nthe fact that there can be art disconnected from \u201cour\u201d\n(Western) institutions and traditions, and our species.  They also\nstruggle to account for the fact that the same aesthetic terms are\nroutinely applied to artworks, natural objects, humans, and abstracta.\nAesthetic definitions do better accounting for art\u2019s\ntraditional, universal features, but less well, at least according to\ntheir critics, with revolutionary modern art; their further defense\nrequires an account of the aesthetic which can be extended in a\nprincipled way to conceptual and other radical art. (An aesthetic\ndefinition and a conventionalist one could simply be conjoined. But\nthat would merely raise, without answering, the fundamental question\nof the unity or disunity of the class of artworks.) Which defect is\nthe more serious one depends on which explananda are the more\nimportant. Arguments at this level are hard to come by, because\npositions are hard to motivate in ways that do not depend on prior\nconventionalist and functionalist sympathies. If list-like definitions\nare flawed because uninformative, then so are conventionalist\ndefinitions, whether institutional or historical. Of course, if the\nclass of artworks, or of the arts, is a mere chaotic heap, lacking any\ngenuine unity, then enumerative definitions cannot be faulted for\nbeing uninformative: they do all the explaining that it is possible to\ndo, because they capture all the unity that there is to capture. In\nthat case the worry articulated by one prominent aesthetician, who\nwrote earlier of the \u201cbloated, unwieldy\u201d concept of art\nwhich institutional definitions aim to capture, needs to be taken\nseriously, even if it turns out to be ungrounded: \u201cIt is not at\nall clear that these words \u2013 \u2018What is\nart?\u2019 \u2013 express anything like a single question, to which\ncompeting answers are given, or whether philosophers proposing answers\nare even engaged in the same debate\u2026.  The sheer variety of\nproposed definitions should give us pause. One cannot help wondering\nwhether there is any sense in which they are attempts to \u2026\nclarify the same cultural practices, or address the same issue\u201d\n(Walton 2007). \n",
