    "preamble": "\n\nGenerally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write\nin English, David Hume (1711\u20131776) was also well known in his\nown time as an historian and essayist. A master stylist in any genre,\nhis major philosophical works\u2014A Treatise of Human\nNature (1739\u20131740), the Enquiries concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748) and concerning the Principles of\nMorals (1751), as well as his posthumously published\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779)\u2014remain\nwidely and deeply influential.\n\nAlthough Hume\u2019s more conservative contemporaries denounced his\nwritings as works of scepticism and atheism, his influence is evident\nin the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam\nSmith. Kant reported that Hume\u2019s work woke him from his\n\u201cdogmatic slumbers\u201d (Prolegomena, Introduction)\nand Jeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume \u201ccaused the scales\nto fall\u201d from his eyes (\u201cA Fragment on Government\u201d,\nchapter 1, paragraph 36, footnote 2).  Charles Darwin regarded his\nwork as a central influence on the theory of evolution. The diverse\ndirections in which these writers took what they gleaned from reading\nhim reflect both the richness of their sources and the wide range of\nhis empiricism. Today, philosophers recognize Hume as a thoroughgoing\nexponent of philosophical naturalism, as a precursor of contemporary\ncognitive science, and as the inspiration for several of the most\nsignificant types of ethical theory developed in contemporary moral\nphilosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Hume spent his childhood at Ninewells, his\nfamily\u2019s modest estate in the border lowlands. He came from a\n\u201cgood family\u201d (MOL 2)\u2014socially well connected but\nnot wealthy. His father died just after David\u2019s second birthday,\nleaving him and his elder brother and sister in\n\n\nthe care of our Mother, a woman of singular Merit, who, though young\nand handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of\nher Children. (MOL 3)\n\n\nKatherine Falconer Hume realized that David was uncommonly precocious,\nso when his older brother went up to Edinburgh University, Hume went\nwith him, although he was only 10 or 11. There he studied Latin and\nGreek, read widely in history and literature, ancient and modern\nphilosophy, and also did some mathematics and natural\nphilosophy\u2014what we now call natural science.\n\nThe education David received, both at home and at the university,\naimed at training pupils to a life of virtue regulated by stern\nScottish Calvinist strictures. Prayers and sermons were prominent\naspects of his home and university life. At some point, Hume read\nThe Whole Duty of Man, a widely circulated Anglican\ndevotional tract that details our duties to God, our fellow human\nbeings, and ourselves.\n\nHume\u2019s family thought him suited for a legal career, but he\nfound the law \u201cnauseous\u201d, preferring to read classical\ntexts, especially Cicero. He decided to become a \u201cScholar and\nPhilosopher\u201d, and followed a rigorous program of reading and\nreflection for three years until \u201cthere seem\u2019d to be\nopen\u2019d up to me a new Scene of Thought\u201d (HL 3.2). The\nintensity of developing his philosophical vision precipitated a\npsychological crisis in the isolated scholar.\n\nThe crisis eventually passed, and Hume remained intent on articulating\nhis \u201cnew Scene of Thought\u201d. As a second son, his\ninheritance was meager, so he moved to France, where he could live\ncheaply, and finally settled in La Fl\u00e8che, a sleepy village in\nAnjou best known for its Jesuit college where Descartes and Mersenne\nhad studied a century before. Here he read French and other\ncontinental authors, especially Malebranche, Dubos, and Bayle, and\noccasionally baited the Jesuits with arguments attacking their\nbeliefs. By this time, Hume had not only rejected the religious\nbeliefs with which he was raised, but was also opposed to organized\nreligion in general, an opposition that remained constant throughout\nhis life. In 1734, when he was only 23, he began writing A\nTreatise of Human Nature.\n\nHume returned to England in 1737 to ready the Treatise for\nthe press. To curry favor with Joseph Butler (1692\u20131752), he\n\u201ccastrated\u201d his manuscript, deleting his controversial\ndiscussion of miracles, along with other \u201cnobler parts\u201d\n(HL 6.2). Book I, \u201cOf the Understanding\u201d, and Book II,\n\u201cOf the Passions\u201d, appeared anonymously in 1739. The next\nyear saw the publication of Book III, \u201cOf Morals\u201d, as well\nas his anonymous \u201cAbstract\u201d of Books I and II.\n\nThe Treatise was no literary sensation, but it didn\u2019t\nfall \u201cdeadborn from the press\u201d (MOL 6), as Hume\ndisappointedly described its reception. Despite his surgical\ndeletions, it attracted enough of \u201ca Murmour among the\nZealots\u201d (MOL 6) to fuel his lifelong reputation as an atheist\nand a sceptic. When he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical\n(\u201cMental\u201d) Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1745, his reputation\nprovoked vocal and ultimately successful opposition. Six years later,\nhe stood for the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, only to be turned down\nagain. Hume never held an academic post.\n\nIn 1745, he accepted a position as a young nobleman\u2019s tutor,\nonly to discover that his charge was insane. A year later he became\nsecretary to his cousin, Lieutenant General James St Clair, eventually\naccompanying him on an extended diplomatic mission in Austria and\nItaly.\n\nIn 1748, An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding appeared,\ncovering the central ideas of Book I of the Treatise and his\ndiscussion of liberty and necessity from Book II. He also included\nmaterial he had excised from the Treatise. In 1751, he\npublished An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, a\n\u201crecasting\u201d of Book III of the Treatise, which he\ndescribed as \u201cincomparably the best\u201d of all his work (MOL\n10). More essays, the Political Discourses, appeared in 1752,\nand Hume\u2019s correspondence reveals that a draft of the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion was also underway at\nthis time.\n\nAn offer to serve as Librarian to the Edinburgh Faculty of Advocates\ngave Hume the opportunity to begin another project, a History of\nEngland, using the law library\u2019s excellent resources.\nPublished in six volumes between 1754 and 1762, his History\nwas a bestseller well into the next century, giving him the financial\nindependence he had long sought. But even as a librarian, Hume\u2019s\nreputation as an atheist and sceptic dogged him. One of his orders for\n\u201cindecent Books\u201d prompted an unsuccessful move for his\ndismissal and excommunication from the Kirk. Friends and publishers\npersuaded him to suppress some of his more controversial writings on\nreligion during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1763, Hume accepted a position as private secretary to the British\nAmbassador to France. During his three-year stay in Paris, he became\nSecretary to the Embassy, and eventually its charg\u00e9\nd\u2019affaires. He became the rage of the Parisian salons,\nenjoying the conversation and company of famous European\nintellectuals. He was known for his love of good food and wine, as\nwell as his enjoyment of the attentions and affections of women.\n\nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1769. He built a house in\nEdinburgh\u2019s New Town, and spent his autumnal years quietly and\ncomfortably, dining and conversing with friends, not all of whom were\n\u201cstudious and literary\u201d, for he also found that his\n\u201ccompany was not unacceptable to the young and careless\u201d\n(MOL 21). He spent considerable time revising his works for new\neditions of his Essays and Treatises, which contained his\ncollected Essays, the two Enquiries, A\nDissertation on the Passions, and The Natural History of\nReligion, but\u2014significantly\u2014not A Treatise of\nHuman Nature.\n\nIn 1775, Hume was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before his death\nin 1776, he arranged for the posthumous publication of his most\ncontroversial work, the Dialogues concerning Natural\nReligion, and composed a brief autobiography, \u201cMy Own\nLife\u201d. Although there was much curiosity about how \u201cthe\ngreat infidel\u201d would face his death, his friends agreed that he\nprepared himself with the same peaceful cheer that characterized his\nlife.\n2. The relation between the Treatise and the Enquiries\n\nIn 1775, as he was readying a revised edition of his Essays and\nTreatises for the press, Hume sent his publisher an\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d, asking that it be included in this and\nany subsequent edition of his works. In it, he complains that his\ncritics focused \u201call their batteries\u201d on the\nTreatise, \u201cthat juvenile work\u201d, which he\npublished anonymously and never acknowledged. He urges his readers to\nregard the Enquiries \u201cas containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles\u201d, assuring his publisher that they\nprovide \u201ca compleat answer\u201d to his critics.\n\nHume\u2019s apparent disavowal of the Treatise and his\nregard for the Enquiries raise a question about how we should\nread his work. Should we take his statements literally and let the\nEnquiries represent his considered view, or should we ignore\nhis \u201cAdvertisement\u201d and take the Treatise as the\nbest statement of his position?\n\nBoth options presuppose that the differences between the\nTreatise and the Enquiries are substantial enough to\nwarrant taking one or the other as best representing Hume\u2019s\nviews, but there are good reasons for doubting this. Even in the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d, Hume says, \u201cMost of the principles,\nand reasonings, contained in this volume, were published\u201d in the\nTreatise. He repeats his conviction that he was guilty of\n\u201cgoing to press too early\u201d, and that his aim in the\nEnquiries was to \u201ccast the whole anew \u2026 where\nsome negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression,\nare \u2026 corrected\u201d.\n\nHume\u2019s description of his aims suggests another option. Rather\nthan repudiating the Treatise, perhaps his recasting of it\nrepresents a shift in the way he presents his \u201cprinciples and\nreasoning\u201d rather than a substantive change in what he has to\nsay. He reinforces this option when he says of the first\nEnquiry that the \u201cphilosophical Principles are the same\nin both\u201d and that \u201cBy shortening & simplifying the\nQuestions, I really render them much more complete\u201d (HL 73.2).\nHe also comments in \u201cMy Own Life\u201d that the\nTreatise\u2019s lack of success \u201cproceeded more from\nthe manner than the matter\u201d\u2014more from its\nstructure than its content (MOL 8). It is not unreasonable to\nconclude that Hume\u2019s recasting of the Treatise was\ndesigned to address this issue, which suggests that we might\nunderstand him best by reading both works, despite their differences,\ntogether.\n3. Philosophical Project\n\nAs the title of the Treatise proclaims, Hume\u2019s subject\nis human nature. He summarizes his project in its subtitle: \u201can\nattempt to introduce the experimental method into moral\nsubjects\u201d. In his day, \u201cmoral\u201d meant anything\nconcerned with human nature, not just ethics, as he makes clear at the\nbeginning of the first Enquiry, where he defines \u201cmoral\nphilosophy\u201d as \u201cthe science of human nature\u201d (EHU\n1.1/5). Hume\u2019s aim is to bring the scientific method to bear on\nthe study of human nature.\n\nHume\u2019s early studies of philosophical \u201csystems\u201d\nconvinced him that philosophy was in a sorry state and in dire need of\nreform. When he was only 18 years old, he complained in a letter that\nanyone familiar with philosophy realizes that it is embroiled in\n\u201cendless Disputes\u201d (HL 3.2). The ancient philosophers, on\nwhom he had been concentrating, replicated the errors their natural\nphilosophers made. They advanced theories that were \u201centirely\nHypothetical\u201d, depending \u201cmore upon Invention than\nExperience\u201d. He objects that they consulted their imagination in\nconstructing their views about virtue and happiness, \u201cwithout\nregarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must\ndepend\u201d. The youthful Hume resolved to avoid these mistakes in\nhis own work, by making human nature his \u201cprincipal Study, &\nthe Source from which I would derive every Truth\u201d (HL 3.6).\n\nEven at this early stage, the roots of Hume\u2019s mature approach to\nthe reform of philosophy are evident. He was convinced that the only\nway to improve philosophy was to make the investigation of human\nnature central\u2014and empirical (HL 3.2). The problem with ancient\nphilosophy was its reliance on \u201chypotheses\u201d\u2014claims\nbased on speculation and invention rather than experience and\nobservation.\n\nBy the time Hume began to write the Treatise three years\nlater, he had immersed himself in the works of the modern\nphilosophers, but found them disturbing, not least because they made\nthe same mistakes the ancients did, while professing to avoid them.\nWhy, Hume asks, haven\u2019t philosophers been able to make the\nspectacular progress in understanding human nature that natural\nphilosophers\u2014whom we now call\n\u201cscientists\u201d\u2014have recently achieved in the physical\nsciences? His answer is that while scientists have cured themselves of\ntheir \u201cpassion for hypotheses and systems\u201d, philosophers\nhaven\u2019t yet purged themselves of this temptation. Their theories\nwere too speculative, relied on a priori assumptions, and\npaid too little attention to what human nature is actually like.\nInstead of helping us understand ourselves, modern philosophers were\nmired in interminable disputes\u2014evident even to \u201cthe rabble\nwithout doors\u201d\u2014giving rise to \u201cthe common prejudice\nagainst metaphysical reasonings of all kinds\u201d, that is,\n\u201cevery kind of argument which is in any way abstruse, and\nrequires some attention to be comprehended\u201d (T xiv.3).\n\nTo make progress, Hume maintains, we need to \u201creject every\nsystem \u2026 however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on\nfact and observation\u201d. These systems, covering a wide range of\nentrenched and influential metaphysical and theological views, purport\nto have discovered principles that give us a deeper and more certain\nknowledge of ultimate reality. But Hume argues that in attempting to\ngo beyond anything we can possibly experience, these metaphysical\ntheories try to \u201cpenetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to\nthe understanding\u201d (EHU 1.11/11), which makes their claims to\nhave found the \u201cultimate principles\u201d of human nature not\njust false, but unintelligible. These \u201cairy sciences\u201d, as\nHume calls them, have only the \u201cair\u201d of science (EHU\n1.12/12).\n\nWorse still, these metaphysical systems are smokescreens for\n\u201cpopular superstitions\u201d that attempt to overwhelm us with\nreligious fears and prejudices (EHU 1.11/11). Hume has in mind a\nvariety of doctrines that need metaphysical cover to look\nrespectable\u2014arguments for the existence of God, the immortality\nof the soul, and the nature of God\u2019s particular providence.\nMetaphysics aids and abets these and other superstitious\ndoctrines.\n\nBut he insists that because these metaphysical and theological systems\nare objectionable, it doesn\u2019t mean we should give up doing\nphilosophy. Instead, we need to appreciate \u201cthe necessity of\ncarrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy\u201d.\nThe only way to resist the allure of these pseudo\u2013sciences is to\nengage with them, countering their \u201cabstruse \u2026\nmetaphysical jargon\u201d with \u201caccurate and just\nreasoning\u201d (EHU 1.12/12).\n\nThis means that the initial phase of Hume\u2019s project must be\ncritical. A prominent part of this aspect of his project is\nto \u201cdiscover the proper province of human\nreason\u201d\u2014determining the extent and limits of\nreason\u2019s powers and capacities (EHU 1.12/12). He believes that\nhis investigation will show that metaphysics as the quest for\nunderstanding the ultimate nature of reality is beyond reason\u2019s\nscope.\n\nScholars once emphasized this critical phase at the expense\nof the rest of Hume\u2019s project, encouraging the charge that he\nwas just a negative skeptic, who rejects the views of others without\ndefending any positive position himself. But while he is indeed\nskeptical about the possibility of metaphysical insights that go\ndeeper than science can, investigating the proper province of reason\nisn\u2019t only a critical activity. His critique of metaphysics\nclears the way for the constructive phase of his\nproject\u2014the development of an empirical science of human\nnature\u2014and Hume is not at all skeptical about its prospects.\n\nIn his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Treatise, Hume\nlaunches the constructive phase of his project by proposing nothing\nless than \u201ca compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation entirely new\u201d (T xvi.6). The new foundation is the\nscientific study of human nature. He argues that all the sciences have\nsome relation to human nature, \u201ceven Mathematics, Natural\nPhilosophy, and Natural Religion\u201d (T xv.4). They are all human\nactivities, so what we are able to accomplish in them depends on\nunderstanding what kinds of questions we are able to handle and what\nsorts we must leave alone. If we have a better grasp of the scope and\nlimits of our understanding, the nature of our ideas, and the\noperations we perform in reasoning about them, there is no telling\nwhat improvements we might make in these sciences.\n\nWe should expect even more improvement in the sciences that are more\nclosely connected to the study of human nature: \u201cLogic,\nMorals, Criticism, and Politics\u201d. Many longstanding\nphilosophical debates are about the nature of our\nideas\u2014causation, liberty, virtue and beauty\u2014so getting\nclear about their content should help us cut through these\n\u201cendless disputes\u201d.\n\nAs the science of human nature is the only solid foundation for the\nother sciences, \u201cthe only solid foundation we can give to this\nscience itself must be laid on experience and observation\u201d (T\nxvi.7). Although Hume does not mention him by name, Newton\n(1642\u20131727) is his hero. He accepts the Newtonian maxim\n\u201cHypotheses non fingo\u201d, roughly, \u201cI do not\ndo hypotheses\u201d. Any laws we discover must be established by\nobservation and experiment.\n\nHume is proposing an empiricist alternative to traditional\na priori metaphysics. His empiricism is naturalistic\nin that it refuses to countenance any appeal to the\nsupernatural in the explanation of human nature. As a\nnaturalist, he aims to account for the way our minds work in a manner\nthat is consistent with a Newtonian picture of the world.\n\nHume portrays his scientific study of human nature as a kind of\nmental geography or anatomy of the mind (EHU\n1.13/13; T 2.1.12.2/326). In the first section of the first\nEnquiry, he says that it has two principal tasks, one purely\ndescriptive, the other explanatory. Mental geography\nconsists in delineating \u201cthe distinct parts and powers\u201d of\nthe mind (EHU 1.13/3). While everyone can make some sense of the basic\ndistinctions among the mind\u2019s contents and operations, more\nfine\u2013grained distinctions are harder to grasp.\n\nHume, however, wants to go much further. He wants to explain\nhow the mind works by discovering its \u201csecret springs and\nprinciples\u201d. He reminds us that astronomers, for a long time,\nwere content with proving the \u201cmotions, order, and magnitude of\nthe heavenly bodies\u201d. But then \u201ca\nphilosopher\u201d\u2014Newton\u2014went beyond them and determined\n\u201cthe laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets\nare governed and directed\u201d (EHU 1.15/14). Newton\u2019s example\nled other natural philosophers to similar explanatory successes. Hume\nbelieves he will be equally successful in finding the fundamental laws\ngoverning our \u201cmental powers and economy\u201d, if he follows\nthe same caution Newton exhibited in carrying out his inquiries.\n\nNewton\u2019s scientific method provides Hume with a template for\nintroducing the experimental method into his investigation of the\nmind. In An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, he\nsays he will follow \u201ca very simple method\u201d that he\nbelieves will bring about a transformation in the study of human\nnature. Following Newton\u2019s example, he argues that we should\n\u201creject every system \u2026 however subtile or ingenious,\nwhich is not founded on fact and observation\u201d, and accept only\narguments derived from experience. When we inquire about human nature,\nsince we are asking \u201ca question of fact, not of abstract\nscience\u201d, we must rely on experience and observation (EPM\n1.10/173\u2013174).\n\nAs the fledgling Newton of the moral sciences, Hume wants to find a\nset of laws that explain how the mind\u2019s\ncontents\u2014perceptions, as he calls them\u2014come and\ngo in the mind and how simple perceptions combine to form complex\nperceptions in ways that explain human thought, belief, feeling and\naction.\n\nNewton\u2019s achievement was that he was able to explain diverse and\ncomplex physical phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Like\nhim, Hume proposes to explain \u201call effects from the simplest and\nfewest causes\u201d (T xvii.8). He predicts that it is likely that\none \u201cprinciple of the mind depends on another\u201d and that\nthis principle may in turn be brought under another principle even\n\u201cmore general and universal\u201d (EHU 1.15/15). But he\nemphasizes that while he will try to find the most general principles,\nrendering them as universal as possible, all of his explanations must\nbe based completely on experience.\n\nAlthough philosophy, as an empirical enterprise, is itself bound by\nexperience, this is not a defect in the science of human nature. The\nsame is true for all the sciences: \u201cNone of them can go beyond\nexperience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that\nauthority\u201d (T Intro 10). Explanations must come to an end\nsomewhere. When we see that we have \u201carriv\u2019d at the utmost\nextent of human reason, we sit down contented\u201d, for the only\nreason we can give for our most general principles is \u201cour\nexperience of their reality\u201d (T 9).\n\nHume is Newtonian in much more than method. He sees that Newton is\nsignificantly different from John Locke (1632\u20131704) and the\nother Royal Society natural philosophers, because he rejects their\nmechanist picture of the world. Newton\u2019s greatest discovery, the\nLaw of Gravitation, is not a mechanical law. Hume explicitly models\nhis account of the fundamental principles of the mind\u2019s\noperations\u2014the principles of association\u2014on the idea of\ngravitational attraction. By appealing to these same principles\nthroughout, Hume gives an explanation of these diverse phenomena that\nenable him to provide a unified and economical account of the\nmind.\n4. Account of the Mind\n\nTo explain the workings of our minds with the economy Newton displayed\nin his physics, Hume introduces the minimal amount of machinery he\nthinks is necessary to account for the mind\u2019s operations. Each\npiece is warranted by experience.\n\nThe early modern period was the heyday of the investigation of the\nideas of causation, moral good and evil, and many other\nphilosophically contested ideas. Every modern philosopher accepted\nsome version of the theory of ideas\u2014the view that we\nimmediately perceive certain mental entities called ideas,\nbut don\u2019t have direct access to physical objects. Hume holds an\nempiricist version of the theory, because he thinks that\neverything we believe is ultimately traceable to experience.\n\nHe begins with an account of perceptions, because he believes\nthat any intelligible philosophical question must be asked and\nanswered in those terms. He uses perception to designate any\nmental content whatsoever, and divides perceptions into two\ncategories, impressions and ideas.\n\nImpressions include sensations as well as\ndesires, passions, and emotions.\nIdeas are \u201cthe faint images of these in thinking and\nreasoning\u201d (T 1.1.1.1/1). He thinks everyone will recognize his\ndistinction, since everyone is aware of the difference between\nfeeling and thinking. It is the difference between\nfeeling the pain of your present sunburn and\nrecalling last year\u2019s sunburn.\n\nHume distinguishes two kinds of impressions: impressions of\nsensation, or original impressions, and impressions\nof reflection, or secondary impressions. Impressions of\nsensation include the feelings we get from our five senses as well as\npains and pleasures, all of which arise in us \u201coriginally, from\nunknown causes\u201d (T 1.1.2.1/7). He calls them original\nbecause trying to determine their ultimate causes would take us beyond\nanything we can experience. Any intelligible investigation must stop\nwith them.\n\nImpressions of reflection include desires, emotions, passions, and\nsentiments. They are essentially reactions or responses to ideas,\nwhich is why he calls them secondary. Your memories of last\nyear\u2019s sunburn are ideas, copies of the original impressions you\nhad when the sunburn occurred. Recalling those ideas causes you to\nfear that you\u2019ll get another sunburn this year, to\nhope that you won\u2019t, and to want to take\nproper precautions to avoid overexposure to the sun.\n\nPerceptions\u2014both impressions and ideas\u2014may be either\nsimple or complex. Complex impressions are made up\nof a group of simple impressions. My impression of the violet I just\npicked is complex. Among the ways it affects my senses are its\nbrilliant purple color and its sweet smell. I can separate and\ndistinguish its color and smell from the rest of my impressions of the\nviolet. Its color and smell are simple impressions, which can\u2019t\nbe broken down further because they have no component parts.\n\nHume initially distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\ndegree of force and vivacity. Impressions are more\nforceful and vivacious than ideas. My impression of this ripe\ntomato\u2019s bright red color is as vivid as anything could be. Last\nyear\u2019s tomatoes were just as vivid when I was looking at them,\nbut now my idea of them is much less vivid than my impressions of the\ntomato in front of me. Since last year\u2019s tomatoes were the same\ncolor, the difference can\u2019t be that they are different shades of\nred; the difference must lie in the sharpness, clarity, and brightness\nof my impressions\u2014their force and vivacity. At\nvarious times, Hume tries other ways of characterizing the difference\nbetween impressions and ideas, but he was never completely satisfied\nwith them. Still, what he says works well enough to give us a handle\non the felt differences between impressions and ideas.\n\nWhen Hume distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\nrelative force and vivacity, he is pointing out something that is\ngenerally true of them as a matter of fact. On occasion, in dreams or\na high fever, ideas may approach the force and vivacity of\nimpressions, but these are exceptions that prove\nthe\u2014empirical\u2014rule. In general, impressions and ideas are\nso different that no one can deny the distinction.\n\nAlthough nothing seems freer than the power of thought, which\nisn\u2019t \u201crestrained within the limits of nature and\nreality\u201d (EHU 2.4/18), Hume insists that our imagination is in\nfact \u201cconfined within very narrow limits\u201d. We can separate\nand combine our ideas in new and even bizarre ways, imagining\ncreatures we\u2019ve never seen or faraway galaxies, but all the\nmaterials of thinking are ultimately derived from our impressions.\nSince \u201call our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of\nour impressions or more lively ones\u201d; we are restricted to\n\u201ccompounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the\nmaterials afforded us by the senses and experience\u201d (EHU\n2.5/19).\n4.1 The Copy Principle\n\nIn the Treatise, Hume qualifies his claim that our ideas are\ncopies of our impressions, making clear that it applies only to the\nrelation between simple ideas and simple\nimpressions. He offers this \u201cgeneral proposition\u201d,\nusually called the Copy Principle, as his \u201cfirst\nprinciple \u2026 in the science of human nature\u201d:\n\n\nAll our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv\u2019d from\nsimple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they\nexactly represent. (T 1.1.1.7/4)\n\n\nHe presents the principle as something that everyone\u2019s\nexperience confirms, but he also gives an argument to establish\nit.\n\nHe argues first that there is a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence\nbetween simple ideas and simple impressions. He can\u2019t\nprove that this correspondence holds universally, since he\ncan\u2019t examine every individual impression and idea. But he is so\nconfident the correspondence holds that he challenges anyone who\ndoubts it to produce an example of a simple impression without a\ncorresponding simple idea, or a simple idea without a corresponding\nsimple impression. Since he is certain they will fail, he concludes\nthat there is a constant conjunction between simple\nimpressions and simple ideas.\n\nNext, he maintains that this constant conjunction is so universal that\nthe correspondence can\u2019t be a matter of chance. There must be a\ncausal connection between them, but do ideas cause impressions or do\nimpressions cause ideas?\n\nFinally, he argues that experience tells us that simple impressions\nalways precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. To support\nthis claim, he appeals to two sorts of cases. First, if you want to\ngive a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece\nof pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of\nthe pineapple\u2019s taste. You never go the other way round. His\nother case involves a person born blind, who won\u2019t have ideas of\ncolor because he won\u2019t have impressions of color.\n\nThe Copy Principle is an empirical thesis, which he emphasizes by\noffering \u201cone contradictory phenomenon\u201d as an empirical\ncounterexample to the principle. He imagines someone who has had the\nsame sorts of experiences of colors most of us have had, but has never\nexperienced a certain shade of blue. Hume thinks that if he orders all\nthe shades of blue he has experienced from the darkest to the\nlightest, he will see immediately that there is a gap where the\nmissing shade should be. Then he asks\n\n\nWhether \u2018tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to\n\u2026 raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade,\ntho\u2019 it had never been convey\u2019d to him by his senses? I\nbelieve there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may\nserve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always deriv\u2019d\nfrom the correspondent impressions; tho\u2019 the instance is so\nparticular and singular, that \u2018tis scarce worth our observing,\nand does not merit that for it alone we shou\u2019d alter our general\nmaxim. (T 1.1.1.10/6)\n\n\nHume repeats the case of the missing shade almost verbatim in the\nfirst Enquiry. While scholars have wondered exactly how the\nperson might supply the missing shade, he seems unconcerned with the\ndetails. For Hume, once again the exception proves\nthe\u2014empirical\u2014rule.\n4.2 Hume\u2019s Account of Definition\n\nAlthough Hume\u2019s distinctive brand of empiricism is often\nidentified with his commitment to the Copy Principle, his use of the\nprinciple\u2019s reverse in his account of definition is perhaps the\nmore innovative element of his system.\n\nAs his diagnosis of traditional metaphysics reveals, Hume believes\nthat\n\n\nthe chief obstacle \u2026 to our improvement in the moral or\nmetaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of\nthe terms. (EHU 7.1.2/61)\n\n\nConventional definitions\u2014replacing terms with their\nsynonyms\u2014merely replicate philosophical confusions and never\nbreak out of a narrow definitional circle. Getting clear about the\ncontent of the ideas and the meanings of the terms we are\ninvestigating requires something else.\n\nHume argues that we must \u201cpass from words to the true and real\nsubject of the controversy\u201d\u2014ideas. He believes he has\nfound a way to accurately determine their content\u2014his account of\ndefinition. He touts it as \u201ca new microscope or species of\noptics\u201d, predicting that it will produce equally dramatic\nresults in the moral sciences as its hardware\ncounterparts\u2014telescopes and microscopes\u2014have produced in\nnatural philosophy (EHU 7.1.4/62).\n\nHume\u2019s account of definition uses a simple series of tests to\ndetermine cognitive content. Begin with a term. Ask what idea is\nannexed to it. If there is no such idea, then the term has no\ncognitive content, however prominently it figures in philosophy or\ntheology. If there is an idea annexed to the term, and it is complex,\nbreak it down into the simple ideas that compose it, and trace them\nback to their original impressions. If the process fails at any point,\nthe idea in question lacks cognitive content. When carried through\nsuccessfully, however, it yields a \u201cjust\ndefinition\u201d\u2014a precise account of the troublesome\nidea\u2019s content.\n\nHume uses his account of definition in the critical phaseof\nhis project to show that many of the central concepts of traditional\nmetaphysics lack intelligible content. He also uses it in the\nconstructive phase to determine the exact meaning of our\nterms and ideas.\n4.3 Principles of Association\n\nAlthough we are capable of separating and combining our simple ideas\nas we please, there is, nevertheless, a regular order to our thoughts.\nIf ideas occurred to us completely randomly, so that all our thoughts\nwere \u201cloose and unconnected\u201d, we wouldn\u2019t be able to\nthink coherently (T 1.1.4.1/10). This suggests that\n\nThere is a secret tie or union among particular ideas, which causes\nthe mind to conjoin them more frequently, and makes the one, upon its\nappearance, introduce the other. (Abstract 35)\n\n\nHume explains this \u201ctie or union\u201d in terms of the\nmind\u2019s natural ability to associate certain ideas.\nAssociation is not \u201can inseparable connexion\u201d, but rather\n\u201ca gentle force, which commonly prevails\u201d, by means of\nwhich one idea naturally introduces another (T 1.1.4.1/10).\n\nIn the first Enquiry, Hume says that even though it is\nobvious to everyone that our ideas are connected in this way, he is\nthe first philosopher who has \u201cattempted to enumerate or class\nall the principles of association\u201d (EHU 3.2/24). He regards his\nuse of these \u201cuniversal principles\u201d as so distinctive that\nhe advertises them as his most original contribution\u2014one that\nentitles him call himself an \u201cinventor\u201d (Abstract\n35).\n\nHume identifies three principles of association: resemblance,\ncontiguity in time and place, and causation. When someone\nshows you a picture of your best friend, you naturally think of her\nbecause the picture resembles her. When you\u2019re reminded\nof something that happened in the 1960s\u2014miniskirts, for\nexample\u2014you may think of the Vietnam War, because they are\ntemporally contiguous. Thinking of Sausalito may lead you to\nthink of the Golden Gate Bridge, which may lead you to think of San\nFrancisco, since they are spatially contiguous.\nCausality works both from cause to effect and effect to\ncause: meeting someone\u2019s father may make you think of his son;\nencountering the son may lead you to thoughts of his father.\n\nOf the three associative principles, causation is the\nstrongest, and the only one that takes us \u201cbeyond our\nsenses\u201d (T 1.3.2.3/74). It establishes links between our present\nand past experiences and our expectations about the future, so that\n\u201call reasonings concerning matters of fact seem to be founded on\nthe relation of Cause and Effect\u201d (EHU\n4.1.4/26). Taking aspirin in the past has relieved my headaches, so I\nexpect that the aspirin I just took will soon relieve my present\nheadache. Hume also makes clear that causation is the least understood\nof the associative principles, but he tells us, \u201cwe shall have\noccasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom\u201d (T\n1.1.4.2/11).\n\nLike gravitational attraction, the associative principles are\noriginal, and so can\u2019t be explained further. Although\nthe associative principles\u2019 \u201ceffects are everywhere\nconspicuous\u201d their causes \u201care mostly unknown, and must be\nresolv\u2019d into original qualities of human nature, which\nI pretend not to explain\u201d. Accordingly, we should curb any\n\u201cintemperate desire\u201d to account further for them, for\ndoing so would take us illegitimately beyond the bounds of experience\n(T 1.1.4.6/12\u201313).\n\nHume doesn\u2019t try to explain why we associate ideas as\nwe do. He is interested only in establishing that, as a matter of\nfact, we do associate ideas in these ways. Given that his\nclaim that the associative principles explain the important operations\nof the mind is an empirical one, he must admit, as he does in the\nfirst Enquiry, that he cannot prove conclusively that his\nlist of associative principles is complete. Perhaps he has overlooked\nsome additional principle. We are free to examine our own thoughts to\ndetermine whether resemblance, contiguity, and causation successfully\nexplain them. The more instances the associative principles explain,\nthe more assurance we have that Hume has identified the basic\nprinciples by which our minds work.\n\nIn the Abstract, Hume concludes that it should be \u201ceasy\nto conceive of what vast consequences these principles must be in the\nscience of human nature\u201d. Since they \u201care the only ties of\nour thoughts, they are really to us the cement of the\nuniverse, and all the operations of the mind must, in great measure,\ndepend on them\u201d (Abstract 35). Just what these \u201cvast\nconsequences\u201d are will become clear when we examine Hume\u2019s\nrevolutionary accounts of our causal inferences and moral\njudgments.\n5. Causation\n\nThe medieval synthesis Thomas Aquinas (1224\u201374) forged between\nChristian theology and Aristotle\u2019s science and metaphysics set\nthe terms for the early modern causation debate. Aristotle\n(384\u2013322 BCE) drew an absolute categorical distinction between\nscientific knowledge (scientia) and belief (opinio).\nScientific knowledge was knowledge of causes and scientific\nexplanation consisted in demonstration\u2014proving the\nnecessary connection between a cause and its effect from\nintuitively obvious premises independently of experience.\n\nModern philosophers thought of themselves as scientific\nrevolutionaries because they rejected Aristotle\u2019s account of\ncausation. Even so, they accepted his distinction between knowledge\nand belief, and regarded causal inference as an exercise of reason,\nwhich aimed at demonstrating the necessary connection between cause\nand effect. Malebranche (1638\u20131715), and others following\nDescartes (1596\u20131650), were optimistic about the possibility of\ndemonstrative scientific knowledge, while those in the British\nexperimental tradition were more pessimistic. Locke was sufficiently\nsceptical about what knowledge we can attain that he constructed one\nof the first accounts of probable inference to show that belief can\nmeet standards of rationality that make experimental natural\nphilosophy intellectually respectable.\n\nWhen Hume enters the debate, he translates the traditional distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief into his own terms, dividing \u201call\nthe objects of human reason or enquiry\u201d into two exclusive and\nexhaustive categories: relations of ideas and matters of\nfact.\n\nPropositions concerning relations of ideas are intuitively or\ndemonstratively certain. They are known a\npriori\u2014discoverable independently of experience by\n\u201cthe mere operation of thought\u201d, so their truth\ndoesn\u2019t depend on anything actually existing (EHU 4.1.1/25).\nThat the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle sum to 180\ndegrees is true whether or not there are any Euclidean triangles\nto be found in nature. Denying that proposition is a contradiction,\njust as it is contradictory to say that 8\u00d77=57.\n\nIn sharp contrast, the truth of propositions concerning matters of\nfact depends on the way the world is. Their contraries are always\npossible, their denials never imply contradictions, and they\ncan\u2019t be established by demonstration. Asserting that Miami\nis north of Boston is false, but not contradictory. We can\nunderstand what someone who asserts this is saying, even if we are\npuzzled about how he could have the facts so wrong.\n\nThe distinction between relations of ideas and matters of\nfact is often called \u201cHume\u2019s Fork\u201d, generally\nwith the negative implication that Hume may be illicitly ruling out\nmeaningful propositions that don\u2019t fit into these two categories\nor fit into both of them. To defuse this objection, however, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Hume\u2019s categories are his\ntranslations of a traditional absolute categorical classificatory\ndistinction, which all his contemporaries and immediate predecessors\naccepted.\n\nHume\u2019s method dictates his strategy in the causation debate. In\nthe critical phase, he argues that his predecessors were\nwrong: our causal inferences aren\u2019t determined by \u201creason\nor any other operation of the understanding\u201d (EHU 5.1.2/41). In\nthe constructive phase, he supplies an alternative: the\nassociative principles are their basis.\n\nHume\u2019s contributions to the critical phase of the\ncausation debate are contained in Treatise 1.3.6 and Section\n4 of the first Enquiry, appropriately titled \u201cSceptical\ndoubts concerning the operations of the understanding\u201d. The\nconstructive phase in his Enquiry account is the\nfollowing section, also appropriately titled \u201cSceptical solution\nof these doubts\u201d, while the corresponding sections of the\nTreatise stretch from 1.3.7 through 1.3.10.\n5.1 Causal Inference: Critical Phase\n\nCausal inferences are the only way we can go beyond the evidence of\nour senses and memories. In making them, we suppose there is some\nconnection between present facts and what we infer from them.\nBut what is this connection? How is it established?\n\nIf the connection is established by an operation of reason or the\nunderstanding, it must concern either relations of ideas or\nmatters of fact.\n\nHume argues that the connection can\u2019t involve relations of\nideas. Effects are different events from their causes, so there is no\ncontradiction in conceiving of a cause occurring, and its usual effect\nnot occurring. Ordinary causal judgments are so familiar that we tend\nto overlook this; they seem immediate and intuitive. But suppose you\nwere suddenly brought into the world as an adult, armed with the\nintellectual firepower of an Einstein. Could you, simply by examining\nan aspirin tablet, determine that it will relieve your headache?\n\nWhen we reason a priori, we consider the idea of the object\nwe regard as a cause independently of any observations we have made of\nit. It can\u2019t include the idea of any other distinct\nobject, including the object we take to be its usual effect. But then\nit can\u2019t show us any \u201cinseparable and inviolable\nconnection\u201d\u2014any necessary\nconnection\u2014between those ideas. Trying to reason a\npriori from your idea of an aspirin, without including any\ninformation you have of its effects from your previous experience,\nyields only your simple ideas of its \u201csensible\nqualities\u201d\u2014its size, shape, weight, color, smell, and\ntaste. It gives you no idea of what \u201csecret powers\u201d it\nmight have to produce its usual effects. Hume concludes that a\npriori reasoning can\u2019t be the source of the connection\nbetween our ideas of a cause and its effect. Contrary to what the\nmajority of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors thought,\ncausal inferences do not concern relations of ideas.\n\nHume now moves to the only remaining possibility. If causal inferences\ndon\u2019t involve a priori reasoning about relations of\nideas, they must concern matters of fact and experience. When\nwe\u2019ve had many experiences of one kind of event constantly\nconjoined with another, we begin to think of them as cause and effect\nand infer the one from the other. But even after we\u2019ve had many\nexperiences of a cause conjoined with its effect, our inferences\naren\u2019t determined by reason or any other operation of the\nunderstanding.\n\nIn the past, taking aspirin has relieved my headaches, so I believe\nthat taking aspirin will relieve the headache I\u2019m having now.\nBut my inference is based on the aspirin\u2019s superficial sensible\nqualities, which have nothing to do with headache relief. Even if I\nassume that the aspirin has \u201csecret powers\u201d that are doing\nthe heavy lifting in relieving my headache, they can\u2019t be the\nbasis of my inference, since these \u201csecret powers\u201d are\nunknown.\n\nNonetheless, Hume observes, \u201cwe always presume, when we see like\nsensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect that\neffects, similar to those we have experienced, will follow from\nthem\u201d (EHU 4.2.16/33). Since we neither intuit nor infer a\npriori that similar objects have similar secret powers, our\npresumption must be based in some way on our experience.\n\nBut our past experience only gives us information about objects as\nthey were when we experienced them, and our present experience only\ntells us about objects we are experiencing now. Causal inferences,\nhowever, do not just record our past and present experiences.\nThey extend or project what we have gathered from\nexperience to other objects in the future. Since it is not necessarily\ntrue that an object with the same sensible qualities will have the\nsame secret powers that past objects with those sensible qualities\nhad, how do we project those experiences into the future, to other\nobjects that may only appear similar to those we\u2019ve previously\nexperienced?\n\nHume thinks we can get a handle on this question by considering two\nclearly different propositions:\n\n(1)\nI\u2019ve found\nthat headache relief has always followed my taking\naspirin;\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nTaking aspirin\nsimilar to the ones I\u2019ve taken in the past will relieve my\npresent headache.\n\n\nThere is no question that \u201cthe one proposition may be justly\ninferred from the other\u201d, and that \u201cit is always\ninferred\u201d. But since their connection obviously isn\u2019t\nintuitive, Hume challenges us to produce the \u201cchain of\nreasoning\u201d that takes us from propositions like (1) to\npropositions like (2) (EHU 4.2.16/34).\n\n(1) summarizes my past experience, while (2) predicts what will happen\nin the immediate future. The chain of reasoning I need must show me\nhow my past experience is relevant to my future experience. I need\nsome further proposition or propositions that will establish an\nappropriate link or connection between past and\nfuture, and take me from (1) to (2) using either demonstrative\nreasoning, concerning relations of ideas, or probable\nreasoning, concerning matters of fact.\n\nHume thinks it is evident that demonstrative reasoning can\u2019t\nbridge the gap between (1) and (2). However unlikely it may be, we can\nalways intelligibly conceive of a change in the course of nature. Even\nthough aspirin relieved my previous headaches, there\u2019s no\ncontradiction in supposing that it won\u2019t relieve the one\nI\u2019m having now, so the supposition of a change in the course of\nnature can\u2019t be proven false by any reasoning concerning\nrelations of ideas.\n\nThat leaves probable reasoning. Hume argues that there is no probable\nreasoning that can provide a just inference from past to future. Any\nattempt to infer (2) from (1) by a probable inference will be\nviciously circular\u2014it will involve supposing what we are trying\nto prove.\n\nHume spells out the circularity this way. Any reasoning that takes us\nfrom (1) to (2) must employ some connecting principle that\nconnects the past with the future. Since one thing that keeps us from\nmoving directly from past to future is the possibility that the course\nof nature might change, it seems plausible to think that the\nconnecting principle we need will be one that will assure us that\nnature is uniform\u2014that the course of nature won\u2019t\nchange\u2014something like this uniformity principle:\n\n[UP]\nThe future will be like the past.\n\n\nAdopting [UP] will indeed allow us to go from (1) to (2). But before\nwe can use it to establish that our causal inferences are determined\nby reason, we need to determine our basis for adopting it. [UP] is\nclearly not intuitive, nor is it demonstrable, as\nHume has already pointed out, so only probable arguments\ncould establish it. But to attempt to establish [UP] this way would be\nto try to establish probable arguments using probable arguments, which\nwill eventually include [UP] itself.\n\nAt this point, Hume has exhausted the ways reason might establish a\nconnection between cause and effect. He assures us that he offers his\n\u201csceptical doubts\u201d not as a \u201cdiscouragement, but\nrather an incitement \u2026 to attempt something more full and\nsatisfactory\u201d. Having cleared the way for his constructive\naccount, Hume is ready to do just that.\n5.2 Causal Inference: Constructive Phase\n\nHume calls his constructive account of causal inference a\n\u201csceptical solution\u201d to the \u201csceptical doubts\u201d\nhe raised in the critical phase of his argument.\n\nSince we\u2019re determined\u2014caused\u2014to make\ncausal inferences, then if they aren\u2019t \u201cdetermin\u2019d\nby reason\u201d, there must be \u201csome principle of equal weight\nand authority\u201d that leads us to make them. Hume maintains that\nthis principle is custom or habit:\n\n\nwhenever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation \u2026 we always say,\nthat this propensity is the effect of Custom. (EHU\n5.1.5/43)\n\n\nIt is therefore custom, not reason, which \u201cdetermines the mind\n\u2026 to suppose the future conformable to the past\u201d\n(Abstract 16). But even though we have located the principle, it is\nimportant to see that this isn\u2019t a new principle by\nwhich our minds operate. Custom and habit are\ngeneral names for the principles of association.\n\nHume describes their operation as a causal process: custom or habit is\nthe cause of the particular propensity you form after your repeated\nexperiences of the constant conjunction of smoke and fire. Causation\nis the operative associative principle here, since it is the only one\nof those principles that can take us beyond our senses and\nmemories.\n\nHume concludes that custom alone \u201cmakes us expect for the\nfuture, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in\nthe past\u201d (EHU 5.1.6/44). Custom thus turns out to be the source\nof the Uniformity Principle\u2014the belief that the future\nwill be like the past.\n5.3 Belief\n\nCausal inference leads us not only to conceive of the effect,\nbut also to expect it. When I expect that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache, I\u2019m not just abstractly considering the\nidea of headache relief, I believe that aspirin will relieve\nit. What more is involved in believing that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache than in merely conceiving that it\nwill?\n\nIt can\u2019t be that beliefs have some additional idea\u2014the\nidea of belief, perhaps\u2014that conceptions lack. If there were\nsome such idea, given our ability to freely combine ideas, we could,\nby simply willing, add that idea to any conception whatsoever, and\nbelieve anything we like.\n\nHume concludes that belief must be some sentiment or feeling aroused\nin us independently of our wills, which accompanies those ideas that\nconstitute them. It is a particular way or manner of conceiving an\nidea that is generated by the circumstances in which we find\nourselves.\n\nIf constant conjunctions were all that is involved, my thoughts about\naspirin and headaches would only be hypothetical. For belief, one of\nthe conjoined objects must be present to my senses or memories; I must\nbe taking, or just have taken, an aspirin. In these circumstances,\nbelieving that my headache will soon be relieved is as unavoidable as\nfeeling affection for a close friend, or anger when someone harms us.\n\u201cAll these operations are species of natural instincts, which no\nreasoning \u2026 is able either to produce or prevent\u201d (EHU\n5.1.8/46\u201347).\n\nWhile Hume thinks that defining this sentiment may be\nimpossible, we can describe belief, if only by analogy,\nalthough he was never completely satisfied with his attempts to do so.\nBelief is a livelier, firmer, more vivid, steady, and intense\nconception of an object. Hume intends these characterizations to go\nbeyond merely recording intensity of feeling to capture how belief\n\n\nrenders realities \u2026 more present to us than fictions, causes\nthem to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence\non the passions and imagination. (EHU 5.2.12/49)\n\n\nBut how does an idea come to be conceived in such a manner that it\nconstitutes a belief?\n\nHume\u2019s explanation is that as I become accustomed to\naspirin\u2019s relieving my headaches, I develop a propensity\u2014a\ntendency\u2014to expect headache relief to follow taking aspirin. The\npropensity is due to the associative bond that my repeated experiences\nof taking aspirin and headache relief have formed. My present\nimpressions of taking an aspirin are as forceful and vivid as anything\ncould be, and some of their force and vivacity transfers across the\nassociative path to the idea of headache relief, enlivening it with\nenough force and vivacity to give it the \u201cstrength and\nsolidity\u201d that constitutes belief.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know how aspirin relieves headaches, it is\nfortunate that there is \u201ca kind of pre-established harmony\nbetween the course of nature and the succession of our ideas\u201d\nthat teaches me to take aspirin when I have a headache. Custom, Hume\nmaintains, in language that anticipates and influenced Darwin,\n\n\nis that principle by which this correspondence has been effected; so\nnecessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our\nconduct, in every circumstance of human life. (EHU 5.2.21/55)\n\n\nIt is far better, Hume concludes, to rely on \u201cthe ordinary\nwisdom of nature\u201d, which ensures that we form beliefs \u201cby\nsome instinct or mechanical tendency\u201d, rather than trusting it\nto \u201cthe fallacious deductions of our reason\u201d (EHU\n5.2.22/55).\n\nIn keeping with his project of providing a naturalistic account of how\nour minds work, Hume has given empirical explanations of our\npropensity to make causal inferences, and the way those inferences\nlead to belief.\n6. The Idea of Necessary Connection\n\nThe early modern causation debate revolved around a family of\n\u201cnearly synonymous\u201d key ideas, the most prominent of which\nwere the ideas of power and necessary connection.\nFor Hume, \u201cthere are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more\nobscure and uncertain\u201d. He showcases the critical and\nconstructive uses of his account of definition as he attempts\n\u201cto fix \u2026 the precise meaning of these terms\u201d, in\norder to \u201cremove some part of that obscurity, which is so much\ncomplained of in this species of philosophy\u201d (EHU\n7.1.3/61\u201362).\n6.1 Necessary Connection: Critical Phase\n\nTo get clear about the idea of power or necessary connection, we need\nto determine the impressions that are its source. Hume identifies\nthree possible sources in the work of his predecessors: Locke thought\nwe get our idea of power secondarily from external\nimpressions of the interactions of physical objects, and\nprimarily from internal impressions of our ability to move\nour bodies and to consider ideas. Malebranche argued that what we take\nto be causes of the motion of bodies or mental activity aren\u2019t\ncauses at all. They are only occasions for God, the sole\nsource of necessary connection, to act in the world. Hume rejects all\nthree possibilities.\n\nHe argues that external impressions of the interactions of\nbodies can\u2019t give rise to our idea of power. When we see that\nthe motion of one billiard ball follows another, we\u2019re only\nobserving their conjunction, never their\nconnection.\n\nAttending to internal impressions of the operations of our\nminds doesn\u2019t help. Although voluntary bodily movements follow\nour willing that those movements occur, this is a matter of fact I\nlearn through experience, not from some internal impression of my\nwill\u2019s power. When I decide to type, my fingers move over the\nkeyboard. When I decide to stop, they stop, but I have no idea how\nthis happens. Were I aware of the power of my will to move my fingers,\nI\u2019d know both how it worked and its limits.\n\nOur ability to control our thoughts doesn\u2019t give us an\nimpression of power, either. We don\u2019t have a clue about how we\ncall up our ideas. Our command over them is limited and varies from\ntime to time. We learn about these limitations and variations only\nthrough experience, but the mechanisms by which they operate are\nunknown and incomprehensible to us. If I decide to think about\nIstanbul, my idea of that city comes to mind, but I experience only\nthe succession of my decision followed by the idea\u2019s appearance,\nnever the power itself.\n\nWhen ordinary people can\u2019t determine an event\u2019s cause,\nthey attribute it to some \u201cinvisible intelligent\nprinciple\u201d. Malebranche and other occasionalists do the same,\nexcept they apply it across the board. True causes aren\u2019t powers\nin the physical world or in human minds. The only true cause is\nGod\u2019s willing that certain objects should always be conjoined\nwith certain others.\n\nAnyone aware of our minds\u2019 narrow limits should realize that\nMalebranche\u2019s theory takes us into\n\u201cfairyland\u201d\u2014it goes so far beyond our experience\nthat we have no way of intelligibly assessing it. It also capitalizes\non how little we know about the interactions of bodies, but since our\nidea of God is based on extrapolations from our faculties, our\nignorance should also apply to him.\n6.2 Necessary Connection: Constructive Phase\n\nSince we\u2019ve canvassed the leading contenders for the source of\nour idea of necessary connection and found them wanting, it might\nseem as if we have no such idea, but that would be too hasty.\nIn our discussion of causal inference, we saw that when we find that\none kind of event is constantly conjoined with another, we begin to\nexpect the one to occur when the other does. We suppose there\u2019s\nsome connection between them, and don\u2019t hesitate to call the\nfirst, the cause, and the second, the effect. We\nalso saw that there\u2019s nothing different in the repetition of\nconstantly conjoined cases from the exactly similar single case,\nexcept that after we\u2019ve experienced their constant\nconjunction, habit determines us to expect the effect when the cause\noccurs.\n\nHume concludes that it is just this felt determination of the\nmind\u2014our awareness of this customary transition from one\nassociated object to another\u2014that is the source of our idea of\nnecessary connection. When we say that one object is necessarily\nconnected with another, we really mean that the objects have acquired\nan associative connection in our thought that gives rise to this\ninference.\n\nHaving located the missing ingredient, Hume is ready to offer a\ndefinition of cause. In fact, he gives us two. The first,\n\n\nA cause is an object, followed by another, where all the objects\nsimilar to the first are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond,\n\n\ngives the relevant external impressions, while the\nsecond,\n\n\nA cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always\nconveys the thought to the other,\n\n\ncaptures the internal impression\u2014our awareness of being\ndetermined by custom to move from cause to effect. Both are\ndefinitions on Hume\u2019s account, but his \u201cjust\ndefinition\u201d of our idea of cause is the conjunction of the two\n(EHU 7.2.29/76\u201377). Only together do they capture all\nthe relevant impressions involved.\n\nHume locates the source of the idea of necessary connection in\nus, not in the objects themselves or even in our ideas of those\nobjects we regard as causes and effects. In doing so, he completely\nchanges the course of the causation debate, reversing what everyone\nelse thought about the idea of necessary connection. Subsequent\ndiscussions of causation must confront the challenges Hume poses for\ntraditional, more metaphysical, ways of looking at our idea of\ncausation.\n\nHume\u2019s treatment of our idea of causation is his flagship\nillustration of how his method works and the revolutionary results it\ncan achieve. He goes on to apply both his method, and its concrete\nresults, to other prominent debates in the modern period, including\nprobable inference, testimony for miracles, free will, and intelligent\ndesign.\n7. Moral Philosophy\n\nHume\u2019s explanation of morality is an important part of his\nefforts to reform philosophy. He takes his primary task to be an\ninvestigation into the origin of the basic moral ideas, which he\nassumes are the ideas of moral goodness and badness. As with the idea\nof cause and necessary connection, he wants to explain moral ideas as\neconomically as possible in terms of their \u201csimplest and fewest\ncauses\u201d. Determining their causes will determine what their\ncontent is\u2014what we mean by them. His secondary concern is to\nestablish what character traits and motives are morally good and\nbad.\n\nHume follows his sentimentalist predecessor, Francis Hutcheson\n(1694\u20131746), in building his moral theory around the idea of a\nspectator who approves or disapproves of people\u2019s character\ntraits and motives. The sentiments of approval and disapproval are the\nsource of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. To evaluate a\ncharacter trait as morally good is to evaluate it as virtuous; to\nevaluate it as morally bad is to evaluate it as vicious.\n\nAs he did in the causation debate, Hume steps into an ongoing debate\nabout ethics, often called the British Moralists debate, which began\nin the mid-seventeenth century and continued until the end of the\neighteenth. He uses the same method here as he did in the causation\ndebate: there is a critical phase in which he argues against\nhis opponents, and a constructive phase in which he develops\nhis version of sentimentalism. Hume has two sets of opponents: the\nself-love theorists and the moral rationalists. He became the most\nfamous proponent of sentimentalism.\n\nThomas Hobbes\u2019 (1588\u20131679) radical attempt to derive moral\nand political obligation from motives of self-interest initiated the\nBritish Moralists debate. Hobbes, as his contemporaries understood\nhim, characterizes us as naturally self-centered and power-hungry,\nconcerned above all with our own preservation. In the state of nature,\na pre-moral and pre-legal condition, we seek to preserve ourselves by\ntrying to dominate others. Since we are all sufficiently\n\u201cequal\u201d in power, this results in a state of \u201cwar of\nall against all\u201d in which life is \u201cnasty, brutish, and\nshort\u201d (Leviathan, Ch. 13). The way out is to make a\ncompact with one another. We agree to hand over our power and freedom\nto a sovereign, who makes the laws necessary for us to live together\npeacefully and has the power to enforce them. While acting morally\nrequires that we comply with the laws the sovereign establishes, the\nbasis of morality is self-interest.\n\nBernard Mandeville\u2019s (1670\u20131733) The Fable of the\nBees served to reinforce this reading of Hobbes during the early\n18th century. According to Mandeville, human beings are\nnaturally selfish, headstrong, and unruly. Some clever politicians,\nrecognizing that we would be better off living together in a civilized\nsociety, took up the task of domesticating us. Realizing that we are\nproud creatures, highly susceptible to flattery, they were able to\ndupe many of us to live up to the ideal of virtue\u2014conquering our\nselfish passions and helping others\u2014by dispensing praise and\nblame. Moral concepts are just tools clever politicians used to tame\nus.\n\nTwo kinds of moral theories developed in reaction first to Hobbes and\nthen to Mandeville\u2014rationalism and sentimentalism. The\nrationalists oppose Hobbes\u2019 claim that there is no right or\nwrong in the state of nature, that rightness or wrongness is\ndetermined by the sovereign\u2019s will, and that morality requires\nsanctions to motivate us. The sentimentalists object to Hobbes\u2019\nand Mandeville\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d conceptions of human\nnature and morality. By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, rationalists\nand sentimentalists were arguing not only against Hobbes and\nMandeville, but also with each other.\n\nHume opposes both selfish and rationalist accounts of morality, but he\ncriticizes them in different works. In the Treatise, Hume\nassumes that Hobbes\u2019 theory is no longer a viable option, so\nthat there are only two possibilities to consider. Either moral\nconcepts spring from reason, in which case rationalism is correct, or\nfrom sentiment, in which case sentimentalism is correct. If one falls,\nthe other stands. In the second Enquiry, Hume continues to\noppose moral rationalism, but his arguments against them\nappear in an appendix. More importantly, he drops the assumption he\nmade in the Treatise and takes the selfish theories of Hobbes\nand Mandeville as his primary target. Once again, he thinks there are\nonly two possibilities. Either our approval is based in self-interest\nor it has a disinterested basis. The refutation of one is proof of the\nother.\n7.1 Moral Rationalism: Critical Phase in the Treatise\n\nHume thinks that \u201csystems and hypotheses\u201d have also\n\u201cperverted our natural understanding\u201d of morality. The\nviews of the moral rationalists\u2014Samuel Clarke (1675\u20131729),\nLocke and William Wollaston (1660\u20131724)\u2014are prominent\namong them. One distinctive, but unhealthy, aspect of modern moral\nphilosophy, Hume believes, is that it allies itself with religion and\nthus sees itself as serving the interests of \u201cpopular\nsuperstition\u201d. Clarke\u2019s theory and those of the other\nrationalists epitomize this tendency.\n\nClarke, Hume\u2019s central rationalist opponent, appeals to reason\nto explain almost every aspect of morality. He believes that there are\ndemonstrable moral relations of fitness and unfitness that we discover\na priori by means of reason alone. Gratitude, for example, is\na fitting or suitable response to kindness, while ingratitude is an\nunfitting or unsuitable response. He believes that the rational\nintuition that an action is fitting has the power both to obligate us\nand to move us. To act morally is to act rationally.\n\nHume\u2019s most famous and most important objection to moral\nrationalism is two-pronged. In Treatise 2.3.3, \u201cOf the\ninfluencing motives of the will\u201d, he rejects the rationalist\nideal of the good person as someone whose passions and actions are\ngoverned by reason. In T 3.1.1, he uses these arguments to show that\nmoral ideas do not spring from reason alone.\n\nIn the first prong of his objection, Hume begins by remarking that\nnothing is more common than for philosophers, as well as ordinary\npeople, to talk about the \u201ccombat\u201d between reason and\npassion. They say we ought to be governed by reason rather than\npassion, and if our passions are not in line with reason\u2019s\ncommands, we ought to restrain them or bring them into conformity with\nreason. Hume counters that \u201creason alone can never be a motive\nto any action of the will\u201d and that by itself it can never\noppose a passion in the direction of the will.\n\nHis first argument rests on his empiricist conception of reason. As we\nsaw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in\ncomparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning\nconcerns matters of fact. He considers mathematical reasoning from the\nrelation of ideas category and causal reasoning from the category of\nmatters of fact. He asks us to look at instances of actions where\nthese two types of reasoning are relevant and says that when we do, we\nwill see that reason alone couldn\u2019t have moved us.\n\nNo one thinks that mathematical reasoning by itself is capable of\nmoving us. Suppose you want to stay out of debt. This may move you to\ncalculate how much money comes in and how much goes out, but\nmathematical reasoning by itself does not move us to do anything.\nMathematical reasoning, when it bears on action, is always used in\nconnection with achieving some purpose and thus in connection with\ncausal reasoning.\n\nHume, however, argues that when causal reasoning figures in the\nproduction of action, it always presupposes an existing desire or\nwant. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea\nto another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the\nideas must be tied to some desire or affection. As he says,\n\n\nIt can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are\ncauses, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are\nindifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us,\ntheir connexion can never give them any influence; and \u2018tis\nplain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion,\nit cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us (T\n2.3.3.3/414).\n\n\nNoticing a causal connection between exercise and losing weight will\nnot move you to exercise, unless you want to lose weight.\n\nIt immediately follows that reason alone cannot oppose a passion in\nthe direction of the will. To oppose a passion, reason must be able to\ngive rise to a motive by itself, since only a motive can oppose\nanother motive, but he has just shown that reason by itself is unable\nto do this.\n\nHaving exposed reason\u2019s pretensions to rule, Hume inverts the\nrationalist\u2019s ideal of the good person, and concludes that\n\u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem\u201d (T 2.3.3.4/415).\n\nThe second prong of Hume\u2019s objection, the argument from\nmotivation, is directed primarily against Clarke and concerns the\nsource of our moral concepts: either they spring from reason or from\nsentiment. Couching this debate in terms of his own version of the\ntheory of ideas, he reminds us that to engage in any sort of mental\nactivity is to have a perception before the mind, so \u201cto approve\nof one character, to condemn another, are only so many different\nperceptions\u201d (T 3.1.1.2/456). Since there are only two types of\nperception\u2014ideas and impressions\u2014the question between\nrationalism and sentimentalism is\n\n\nWhether \u2019tis by means of our ideas or impressions we\ndistinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable\nor praise-worthy? (T 3.1.1.3/456)\n\n\nThe argument from motivation has only two premises. The first is that\nmoral ideas have pervasive practical effects. Experience shows that we\nare often motivated to perform an action because we think it is\nobligatory or to refrain because we think it is unjust. We try to\ncultivate the virtues in ourselves and are proud when we succeed and\nashamed when we fail. If morality did not have these effects on our\npassions and actions, moral rules and precepts would be pointless, as\nwould our efforts to be virtuous. Thus \u201cmorals excite passions,\nand produce or prevent actions\u201d (T 3.1.1.6/457).\n\nThe second premise is that by itself reason is incapable of exciting\npassions or producing and preventing actions, which Hume supports with\nthe arguments we just looked at about the influencing motives of the\nwill. The argument from motivation, then, is that if moral concepts\nare capable of exciting passions and producing or preventing actions,\nbut reason alone is incapable of doing these things, then moral\nconcepts can\u2019t spring from reason alone.\n\nReason for Hume is essentially passive and inert: it is incapable by\nitself of giving rise to new motives or new ideas. Although he thinks\nthe argument from motivation is decisive, in T 3.1.1 he offers a\nbattery of additional arguments, which are intended to show that moral\nconcepts do not arise from reason alone.\n\nHume takes the defeat of rationalism to entail that moral concepts\nspring from sentiment. Of course, he was not the first to claim that\nmoral ideas arise from sentiment. Hutcheson claimed that we possess,\nin addition to our external senses, a special moral sense that\ndisposes us to respond to benevolence with the distinctive feelings of\napprobation. Hume, however, rejects the idea that the moral sentiments\narise from a sense that is an \u201coriginal quality\u201d\nand part of our \u201cprimary constitution\u201d.\n\nHe first argues that there are many different types of virtue, not all\nof which are types of benevolence\u2014respecting people\u2019s\nproperty rights, keeping promises, courageousness, and\nindustriousness\u2014as Hutcheson maintained. If we agree with Hume,\nbut keep Hutcheson\u2019s idea of a moral sense, we would have to\nbelieve that we have many different \u201coriginal\u201d senses,\nwhich dispose us to approve of the variety of different virtues\nseparately. But he complains that this is not only highly implausible,\nbut also contrary to the\n\n\nusual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles\nproduce all the variety we observe in the universe. (T\n3.1.2.6/473)\n\n\nInstead of multiplying senses, we should look for a few general\nprinciples to explain our approval of the different virtues.\n\nThe real problem, however, is that Hutcheson just\nclaims\u2014hypothesizes\u2014that we possess a unique, original\nmoral sense. If asked why we have a moral sense, his reply is that God\nimplanted it in us. Although in his critical phase Hume freely borrows\nmany of Hutcheson\u2019s arguments to criticize moral rationalism,\nhis rejection of a God-given moral sense puts him on a radically\ndifferent path from Hutcheson in his constructive phase. One way of\nunderstanding Hume\u2019s project is to see it as an attempt to\nnaturalize Hutcheson\u2019s moral sense theory. He aims to provide a\nwholly naturalistic and economical explanation of how we come to\nexperience the moral sentiments that also explains why we approve of\nthe different virtues. In the course of explaining the moral\nsentiments, Hutcheson\u2019s idea of an original moral sense\ndisappears from Hume\u2019s account of morality.\n7.2 Sentimentalism: Constructive Phase\n\nIn Treatise 3.3.1, Hume turns to his constructive task of\nproviding a naturalistic explanation of the moral sentiments. He\nrefers to them as feelings of approval or disapproval, praise or\nblame, esteem or contempt. Approval is a kind of pleasant or agreeable\nfeeling; disapproval a kind of painful or disagreeable feeling. In\nseveral key passages, he describes the moral sentiments as calm forms\nof love and hatred. When we evaluate our own character traits, pride\nand humility replace love and hatred.\n\nHume\u2019s project is \u201cto discover the true origin of morals,\nand of that love or hatred, which arises\u201d (T 3.3.1/575) when we\ncontemplate our own or other people\u2019s character traits and\nmotives. He traces the moral sentiments to sympathy. Sympathy\nis a psychological mechanism that explains how we come to feel what\nothers are feeling. It is not itself a feeling or sentiment and so\nshould not be confused with feelings of compassion or pity. Hume\nappeals to sympathy to explain a wide range of phenomena: our interest\nin history and current affairs, our ability to enjoy literature,\nmovies, and novels, as well as our sociability. It is central to his\nexplanations of our passions, our sense of beauty, and our sense of\nwhat is morally good and bad.\n\nSympathy is a process that moves me from my idea of what someone is\nfeeling to actually experiencing the feeling. There are four steps to\nthis process. I first arrive at the idea of what someone is feeling in\nany of the usual ways. I next become aware of the\nresemblances between us, so we are linked by that principle\nof association. While we resemble every human being to some extent, we\nalso resemble some individuals more than others\u2014for instance,\nthose who share our language or culture or are the same age and sex as\nwe are. The associative principles of contiguity and\ncausality also relate individuals who are located closely to\nus in time or space or who are family members or teachers. According\nto Hume, we are able to sympathize more easily and strongly with\nindividuals with whom we have strong associative ties. The stronger\nthe associative relations, the stronger our sympathetic responses.\nHume then claims\u2014controversially\u2014that we always have a\nvivid awareness of ourselves. Finally, he reminds us that the\nprinciples of association not only relate two perceptions, but they\nalso transmit force and vivacity from one perception to another.\n\nSuppose my friend recently suffered a devastating loss and I realize\nshe is feeling sad. The associative principles transmit force and\nvivacity from my vivid awareness of myself to my idea of my\nfriend\u2019s sadness. Since for Hume the difference between\nimpressions and ideas is that impressions are more lively and\nvivacious than ideas, if an idea of a passion is sufficiently\nenlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. I now feel sad too, but\nnot quite as strongly as my friend.\n\nThe way Hume uses the idea that the associative principles transmit\nforce and vivacity in his explanation of sympathy is parallel to the\nway he uses it in his explanation of causal inference. In the case of\ncausal inference, if we have an impression of an effect (smoke), the\nassociative principles give rise not only to the idea of its cause\n(fire), but they also transmit some of the impression\u2019s force\nand vivacity to the idea of its cause, so that we come to believe that\nfire is the cause of the smoke. A belief is an idea that is so lively\nthat it is like an impression, and influences us in the way\nimpressions do. Similarly, my lively awareness of myself enlivens by\nassociation my idea of my friend\u2019s sadness. But the result in\nthe case of sympathy is even stronger: when an idea of a passion is\nsufficiently enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself.\n\nOne advantage Hume\u2019s explanation of the moral sentiments in\nterms of sympathy has over Hutcheson\u2019s claim that we possess a\nGod-given moral sense is that it enables him to provide a unified\ntheory of the mind. He explains the moral sentiments by appealing to\nsympathy, which, in turn, he explains in terms of the same associative\nprinciples he invoked to explain causal beliefs. Without sympathy, and\nthe associative principles that explain it, we would be unimaginably\ndifferent than we are\u2014creatures without causal or moral\nideas.\n\nHume develops his account of moral evaluation further in response to\ntwo objections to his claim that the moral sentiments arise from\nsympathy. The first is the \u201csympathy is variable\u201d\nobjection. Sympathy enables us to enter into the feelings of anyone,\neven strangers, because we resemble everyone to some extent. But it is\nan essential feature of his account of the natural and spontaneous\noperation of sympathy that our ability to respond sympathetically to\nothers varies with variations in the associative relations. I am able\nto sympathize more easily and strongly with someone who resembles me\nor is related to me by contiguity or causation. The objection is that\nthe moral sentiments can\u2019t be based in sympathy because the\nloves and hatreds that result from the natural and spontaneous\nworkings of sympathy vary, but our moral approval doesn\u2019t vary.\nThe second objection is that \u201cvirtue in rags\u201d still evokes\nour approval. Sympathy works by looking at the actual effects of a\nperson\u2019s character traits, but sometimes misfortune or lack of\nopportunity may prevent an individual from exercising their good\ncharacter traits, yet we still admire them.\n\nHume argues that moral love and hatred spring from sympathy, but only\nwhen we regulate our sympathetic reactions by taking up what he calls\n\u201cthe general point of view\u201d. There are two regulatory\nfeatures to the general point of view. The first is that we survey a\nperson\u2019s character from the perspective of the person and his\nusual associates\u2014friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. We\nsympathize with the person and the people with whom that person\nregularly interacts and judge character traits in terms of whether\nthey are good or bad for these people. Second, we regulate sympathy\nfurther by relying on general rules that specify the general effects\nand tendencies of character traits rather than sympathizing with their\nactual effects.\n\nBy putting together these two regulatory features, we arrive at\nHume\u2019s idea of the general point of view, which defines a\nperspective from which we may survey a person\u2019s character traits\nthat we share with everyone. When we occupy the general point of view,\nwe sympathize with the person herself and her usual associates, and\ncome to admire the person for traits that are normally good for\neveryone. The general point of view is, for Hume, the moral\nperspective. We do not experience the moral sentiments unless we have\nalready taken up the general point of view. The moral sentiments and\nthe concepts to which they give rise are products of taking up that\nstandpoint.\n\nHume offers the claim that we admire four sorts of character\ntraits\u2014those that are useful or immediately agreeable to the\nagent or to others\u2014as an empirical hypothesis. While he provides\nsupport for it in his discussion of the individual virtues, he also\nuses his fourfold classification to undermine Christian conceptions of\nmorality. He makes pride a virtue and humility a vice. He throws out\nthe \u201cmonkish\u201d virtues\u2014celibacy, fasting, and\npenance\u2014on the grounds that they are not pleasant or useful to\nanyone. He also rejects the distinction between virtues and natural\ntalents, which legislators, \u201cdivines\u201d and modern moralists\ndefend by claiming that the moral virtues are voluntary, whereas\nnatural talents aren\u2019t. Their goal is to reform us\u2014or at\nleast our outward behavior\u2014making us better, when understood in\nChristian terms. They accordingly restrict the domain of the moral to\nactions that proceed from character traits because they believe only\nthey can be modified, shaped, and controlled by sanctions, while\ntalents can\u2019t. Hume, however, rejects the distinction along with\nthe dubious function these reformers assign to morality.\n\nHume identifies both what has value and what makes things valuable\nwith features of our psychology. Our first-order sentiments, passions\nand affections, as well as actions expressive of them, are what have\nmoral value. Our second-order reflective sentiments about our own or\nother people\u2019s sentiments, passions and affections are what give\nthem value. On his view, morality is entirely a product of human\nnature.\n\nIn the \u201cConclusion\u201d of the second Enquiry, Hume\nsummarizes his explanation of morality with a definition of virtue or\nmerit:\n\n\nevery quality of mind, which is useful or agreeable\nto the person himself or to others,\ncommunicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is\nadmitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. (EPM\n9.1.12/277)\n\n\nThis is a precise parallel of his two definitions of cause in the\nfirst Enquiry. Both sets of definitions pick out features of\nevents, and both record a spectator\u2019s response to those\nevents.\n7.3 Self-Interest Theories: Critical Phase in the Enquiry\n\nHume\u2019s second Enquiry is a sustained and systematic\nattack on the \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201cself-love\u201d\ntheories of Hobbes and Mandeville. He follows Hutcheson in thinking\nthat they assign two distinct roles to self-interest in their accounts\nof morality: first, moral approval and disapproval are based in a\nconcern for our own interest and, second, the motive of which we\nultimately approve is self-interest. Although many people during this\nperiod understood Hobbes\u2019 theory through Mandeville\u2019s\nlens, Hume believes it is important to distinguish them. As he sees\nit, Mandeville\u2019s theory is superficial and easily dismissed.\nHobbes is his main opponent.\n\nHume\u2019s rejection of Hobbes\u2019 selfish account of approval\nand disapproval begins in Section II and ends in Part I of the\n\u201cConclusion\u201d of the Enquiry. Like Hutcheson, he\nmistakenly supposes that Hobbes was offering a rival theory of\napproval and disapproval. We approve of people\u2019s character\ntraits when they benefit us and disapprove of them when they harm us.\nHume looks at each of the four types of virtue and argues that in each\ncase, our approval does not spring from a concern for our own\nhappiness, but rather from sympathy.\n\nIn Section II, Hume argues that one reason we approve of benevolence,\nhumanity, and public spiritedness is that they are useful to others\nand to society. In Sections III and IV, he argues that the sole ground\nfor approving of justice and political allegiance is that they are\nuseful to society. In Section V, he asks: But useful for whom? Since\nit is obvious that it has to be \u201cfor some body\u2019s\ninterest\u201d, the question is \u201cWhose interest then?\u201d He\nassumes there are only two possibilities: approval and disapproval\nspring either from sentiments that are interested or from a\ndisinterested source.\n\nAccording to Hume, Hobbes\u2019 \u201cdeduction of morals from\nself-love\u201d begins with our realization that we cannot subsist\nalone. A social order provides security, peace, and mutual protection,\nconditions that allow us to promote our own interests better than if\nwe lived alone. Our own good is thus bound up with the maintenance of\nsociety. Although Hume agrees with Hobbes up to this point, he rejects\nhis explanation that we approve of justice, benevolence, and humanity\nbecause they promote our own happiness.\n\nHume is confident that \u201cthe voice of nature and\nexperience\u201d will show that Hobbes\u2019 theory, understood in\nthis way, is mistaken. Borrowing many of Hutcheson\u2019s arguments,\nhe points out that if approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout the possible advantages and disadvantages to us of\npeople\u2019s characters and actions, we would never feel approval\nand disapproval of people from \u201cvery distant ages and remote\ncountries\u201d, since they cannot possibly affect us. We would never\nadmire the good deeds of our enemies or rivals, since they are hurtful\nto us. We would also never approve or disapprove of characters\nportrayed in novels or movies, since they are not real people and\ncannot possibly help or harm us. We approve of character traits and\nactions that are useful not because they benefit us, but because we\nsympathize with the benefits they bestow on others or society.\n\nHume next examines the remaining three types of character\ntraits\u2014those that are useful to the agent (industriousness, good\njudgment), agreeable to the agent (cheerfulness) or agreeable to\nothers (politeness, decency). Why, for example, do we approve of\nindustriousness and good judgment, character traits that are primarily\nadvantageous to the possessor? In most cases they are of absolutely no\nbenefit to us and, in cases of rivalry, they counteract our own\ninterest. We approve of these character traits not because they are\nbeneficial to us, but because we sympathize with the benefits they\nconfer on others. Hume takes this as further evidence against\nHobbes\u2019 explanation in terms of self-interest and in support of\nhis sympathy-based account.\n\nIn Part I of the \u201cConclusion\u201d, Hume complains that\nHobbes\u2019 self-love theory is unable to explain two important\nfeatures of our moral sentiments: we tend to approve of the same sorts\nof character traits and we are able to morally evaluate anyone, at any\ntime or place. If our approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout our own benefits and harms, the moral sentiments would vary from\nperson to person and for the same person over time. We wouldn\u2019t\nhave moral feelings about most people, since most people don\u2019t\naffect us. The moral sentiments spring from our capacity to respond\nsympathetically to others.\n\nHume is equally adamant that any explanation of the motives that\nprompt us to virtuous actions in terms of self-interest is mistaken.\nHe opposes them in Appendix II of the Enquiry, which was\noriginally part of Section II, \u201cOf Benevolence\u201d. He\nfollows Hutcheson in thinking that the issue is whether the various\nbenevolent affections are genuine or arise from self-interest. Once\nagain he distinguishes Mandeville\u2019s from Hobbes\u2019\nexplanations of benevolence and takes Hobbes to be his main opponent.\nOn Hume\u2019s reading of Hobbes, while we approve of kindness,\nfriendship, and other benevolent affections, any desire to benefit\nothers really derives from self-interest, although we may not always\nbe conscious of its influence on those desires.\n\nHume offers two arguments against this selfish view. He first asks us\nto consider cases in which people are motivated by a genuine concern\nfor others, even when such concern could not possibly benefit them and\nmight even harm them. We grieve when a friend dies, even if the friend\nneeded our help and patronage. How could our grief be based in\nself-interest? Parents regularly sacrifice their own interests for the\nsake of their children. Non-human animals care about members of their\nown species and us. Is their concern a \u201cdeduction\u201d of\nself-interest? He concludes that these and \u201ca thousand other\ninstances \u2026 are marks of a general benevolence in human nature,\nwhere no interest binds us\u201d (EPM App 2.11/300).\n\nHume supplements this argument from experience with a highly\ncompressed sketch of an argument he borrows from Butler. Happiness\nconsists in the pleasures that arise from the satisfaction of our\nparticular appetites and desires. It is because we want food, fame,\nand other things that we take pleasure in getting them. If we did not\nhave any particular appetites or desires, we would not want anything\nand there would be nothing from which we would get pleasure. To get\nthe pleasures that self-love aims at, we must want something other\nthan happiness itself.\n7.4 Justice: Constructive Phase\n\nHume rightly showcases his pioneering account of justice. In the\nTreatise, he emphasizes the distinction between the natural\nand artificial virtues. The natural virtues\u2014being humane, kind,\nand charitable\u2014are character traits and patterns of behavior\nthat human beings would exhibit in their natural condition, even if\nthere were no social order. The artificial virtues\u2014respecting\npeople\u2019s property rights, fidelity in keeping promises and\ncontracts, and allegiance to government\u2014are dispositions based\non social practices and institutions that arise from conventions.\n\nHume believes that nature has supplied us with many\nmotives\u2014parental love, benevolence, and generosity\u2014that\nmake it possible for us to live together peacefully in small societies\nbased on kinship relations. One of his important insights is that\nnature has not provided us with all the motives we need to live\ntogether peacefully in large societies. After arguing in\nTreatise 3.2.1 that justice is artificial, in T 3.2.2, he\nasks two different questions: What motivates human beings to establish\nthe rules of justice that give rise to property rights, and why do we\napprove of people who obey these rules of justice? The first question\nconcerns justice as a practice constituted by its rules. The second\nconcerns justice as a virtue, a person\u2019s disposition to obey the\nrules of justice.\n\nHume argues that we enter into a series of conventions to bring about\npractices, each of which is a solution to a problem. Each convention\ngives rise to new problems that in turn pressure us to enter into\nfurther conventions. The convention to bring about property rights is\nonly the first of several into which we enter. After property rights\nare established, we enter into conventions to transfer property and to\nmake promises and contracts. According to him, we are by nature\ncooperators, although at first we cooperate only with members of our\nown family. But it is also advantageous for us to cooperate with\nstrangers, since it allows us to produce more goods and to exchange\nthem. All three conventions are prior to the formation of government.\nOn Hume\u2019s view, it is possible for there to be a peaceful\nsociety of property owners who transfer and exchange material\npossessions before there is government.\n\nHume argues that the practice of justice is a solution to a problem we\nnaturally face. The problem is that since we care most about our\nfamily and close friends, but material goods are scarce and portable,\nwe are tempted to take goods from strangers to give to our family and\nfriends. Disputes over these goods are inevitable, but if we quarrel\nwe will forfeit the benefits that result from living together in\nsociety\u2014increased power, ability, and security. The solution to\nthe problem is to establish property rights. We make rules that\nspecify who has a right to what, and agree to follow the rules and to\nkeep our hands off the property of others. Hume was one of the first\nto see that what is useful is the practice of justice, rather than\nindividual acts of justice. Like Hobbes, he believes that it is in our\ninterest to have the practice of justice in place.\n\nAs we just saw, Hume parts company with Hobbes when he answers the\nsecond question about why we approve of people who obey the rules of\njustice. If Hobbes\u2019 answer in terms of self-interest is\nexcluded, he thinks only one possibility remains. We approve of just\npeople not because they benefit us but because we sympathize with the\nbenefits they bestow on others and society as a whole. Hume thus\nexplains our approval of justice by appealing to the same principle he\ninvoked to explain our approval of the natural virtues. Thus\n\nself-interest is the original motive to the establishment\nof justice: but a sympathy with public interest is the source of\nthe moral approbation, which attends that virtue. (T\n3.2.2.24/499\u2013500)\n\n\nIn Part 2 of the \u201cConclusion\u201d of the Enquiry,\nHume raises a serious problem with his account of justice. While it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place, it may not\nalways be in our interest to obey its rules in every case. This is the\nfree rider problem. The free rider, whom Hume calls the sensible\nknave, wants to get the benefits that result from having a practice in\nplace without having to always follow its rules. He knows that the\nonly way to obtain the advantages of social cooperation is for the\npractice of justice to be in place, but he also realizes that a single\nact of injustice will not significantly damage the practice. Most\npeople will obey the rules of justice, so if he commits one act of\ninjustice, the institution will not be in any danger of collapsing.\nSuppose he has the opportunity to commit an act of injustice that will\nbenefit him greatly. Why shouldn\u2019t he?\n\nHume confesses that if the sensible knave expects an answer, he is not\nsure there is one that will convince him.\n\n\nIf his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims, if he feel no\nreluctance to thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a\nconsiderable motive to virtue\u2026. (EPM 9.2.23/283)\n\n\nThere is no general agreement about whether Hume actually provides an\nanswer to the sensible knave and if he does, whether it is\nadequate.\n8. Philosophy of Religion\n\nHume wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question\nin the philosophy of religion, contributing to ongoing debates about\nthe reliability of reports of miracles, the immateriality and\nimmortality of the soul, the morality of suicide, and the natural\nhistory of religion, among others. All his work excited heated\nreactions from his contemporaries, and his arguments still figure\ncentrally in discussions of these issues today.\n\nHume\u2019s greatest achievement in the philosophy of religion is the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion, which is generally\nregarded as one of the most important and influential contributions to\nthis area of philosophy. While all Hume\u2019s books provoked\ncontroversy, the Dialogues were thought to be so inflammatory\nthat his friends persuaded him to withhold them from publication until\nafter his death.\n\nHume\u2019s philosophical project, and the method he developed to\nexecute it, dictates his strategy in all the debates he entered. In\nthe debates about causation and ethics, there is an initial\ncritical phase, where Hume assesses the arguments of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, followed by a constructive\nphase, where he develops his own position. In the natural\nreligion debate, however, the situation is very different.\nHume\u2019s critique of the central concepts of natural religion in\nthe critical phase shows that these concepts have no content,\nso there is nothing for the constructive phase of his\nargument to be about. Instead of resolving this debate, Hume\neffectively dissolves it.\n\nThe Dialogues are a sustained and penetrating critical\nexamination of a prominent argument from analogy for the existence and\nnature of God, the argument from design. The argument from design\nattempts to establish that the order we find in the universe is so\nlike the order we find in the products of human artifice that it too\nmust be the product of an intelligent designer.\n8.1 The Characters\n\nThe Dialogues record a conversation between three characters.\nCleanthes, a self\u2013\u00adproclaimed \u201cexperimental\ntheist\u201d, offers the argument from design as an empirical proof\nof God\u2019s existence and nature (DCNR 5.2/41). Demea\nopposes him, maintaining that the argument\u2019s merely probable\nconclusion demeans God\u2019s mystery and majesty. He believes that\nGod\u2019s nature is completely inscrutable. Cleanthes dubs Demea a\nmystic, while Demea derides Cleanthes\u2019\nanthromorphism\u2014his human\u2013centered bias in\ncomparing the creator of the universe to a human mind.\n\nCleanthes and Demea represent the central positions in the\neighteenth\u2013century natural religion debate. Cleanthes embodies\nits dominant, progressive strain, consisting primarily of theologians\nin the British Royal Society, who were fascinated by probability and\nthe previous century\u2019s impressive successes in experimental\nnatural philosophy. Convinced that the new science gave witness to\nGod\u2019s providence, they rejected traditional a priori\nproofs, which purported to demonstrate God\u2019s existence with\nmathematical certainty and without appeal to experience. Instead, they\nused the order and regularity they found in the universe to construct\na probabilistic argument for a divine designer.\n\nHoldouts clung to demonstrative proof in science and theology against\nthe rising tide of probability. Demea is the champion of these\nconservative traditionalists. Since he trots out a lame version of\nSamuel Clarke\u2019s cosmological argument in Part 9, some have\nthought that Hume models Demea on him. But Demea lacks Clarke\u2019s\nrigid rationalism. It is more likely that he epitomizes a group of\nminor theologians such as William King, who stressed God\u2019s\nincomprehensibility and resorted to a priori arguments only\nwhen they absolutely needed them.\n\nThere was no genuinely sceptical presence in the\neighteenth\u2013century natural religion debate. This makes\nPhilo, who both Cleanthes and Demea characterize as a\nsceptic, the ringer in the conversation. Although all three\ncharacters say very Humean things at one time or another,\nPhilo\u2019s views are consistently the closest to Hume\u2019s.\nPhilo\u2019s form of scepticism is the mitigated scepticism\nof the first Enquiry, which makes him the most likely\ncandidate for Hume\u2019s spokesman.\n\nAs the Dialogues begin, all three characters agree that their\nsubject is God\u2019s nature, since everyone agrees that he\nexists. Parts 1\u20138 concern God\u2019s natural\nattributes, his omnipotence, omniscience, and providence, while\nParts 10 and 11 consider his moral attributes, his\nbenevolence and righteousness.\n8.2 God\u2019s Natural Attributes\n\nDemea holds that God is completely unknown and incomprehensible; all\nwe can say is that God is a being without restriction, absolutely\ninfinite and universal. Cleanthes is adamant that the argument from\ndesign establishes all of God\u2019s traditional attributes. Natural\nobjects and human artifacts resemble one another, so by analogy, their\ncauses also resemble each other. God is therefore like a human mind,\nonly very much greater in every respect.\n\nDemea objects that the argument\u2019s conclusion is only probable,\nbut Philo responds that the real problem is that the analogy is so\nweak. He launches a battery of arguments to show just how weak it is.\nThe dissimilarities between human artifacts and the universe are more\nstriking than their similarities. We only experience a tiny part of\nthe universe for a short time; much of what we do experience is\nunknown to us. How can we legitimately infer anything about remote\nparts of the universe, much less the universe as a whole?\n\nPhilo, however, moves quickly away from chipping at the\nargument\u2019s strength to questioning the intelligibility\nof its conclusion. We have no experience of the origin of a\nuniverse. Since causal inference requires a basis in experienced\nconstant conjunction between two kinds of things, how can we\nlegitimately draw any conclusion whatsoever about the origin of the\nuniverse? Does it even require a cause? One or many? Does the cause of\nthe universe itself require a cause? The problem, then, is not just\nthat the analogy is weak; the real problem is that it attempts to take\nus beyond what we can know.\n\nMeanwhile, Demea derides Cleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism\nwhile remaining smugly satisfied with what Cleanthes disparagingly\ncalls his mysticism. The barbs they throw at each other, and\nthe speeches Philo goads them to make, help create a dilemma that\nPhilo uses them to construct. He directs the dilemma at Cleanthes, but\nit affects both characters, although Demea is slow to realize this. He\nthinks Philo is in league with him in detailing the problems with\nCleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism.\n\nChallenging Cleanthes to explain what he means by God\u2019s mind,\nPhilo pushes him to admit that he means \u201ca mind like the\nhuman\u201d. Cleanthes, taking the bait, responds, \u201cI know of\nno other\u201d (DCNR 5.4/42). He argues that mystics like Demea are\nno better than atheists, since they make God so remote and\nincomprehensible that he bears no resemblance to human\ncharacteristics. Philo adds that although we regard God as perfect,\nperfection\u2014as we understand it\u2014is relative, not absolute,\nso we can\u2019t conclude that we grasp God\u2019s perfections.\nSince all God\u2019s attributes involve perfection\u2014perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, perfect goodness\u2014we shouldn\u2019t\nthink that any of his attributes resemble or are even\nanalogous to ours. But this means that we don\u2019t know what\nwe\u2019re talking about when we talk about God using the familiar\nterms we apply to human minds.\n\nDemea adds that giving God human characteristics, even if they are\ngreatly magnified, denies him attributes theists have always ascribed\nto him. How can an anthropomorphic God have the unity,\nsimplicity, and immutability of the God of\ntraditional theism?\n\nPhilo continues to detail just how inconvenient\nCleanthes\u2019 anthropomorphism really is. If he accepts the\nargument from design, he must be committed to a God who is finite in\nall respects. But what does it mean to say that God is finitely\nperfect? Once you admit that God is finite, you\u2019ve opened a\ncan of worms, for there are all sorts of equally probable alternatives\nto intelligent design. Why think that the universe is more like a\nhuman artifact than an animal or a vegetable? To illustrate, Philo\nthrows out a number of outlandish alternative hypotheses. For\ninstance, if you were a spider on a planet of spiders, wouldn\u2019t\nyou naturally believe that a giant spider spun an immense web to\ncreate the world?\n\nCleanthes\u2019 design hypothesis is so underdetermined by the\nevidence that the only reasonable approach is to abandon any attempt\nto adjudicate among it and its many alternatives. Total suspension of\njudgment is the only reasonable response. Otherwise, we go beyond the\nbounds of anything to which we can give specific content.\n\nThe dilemma Philo has constructed encapsulates the issue about the\ncontent of the idea of God that is central to the critical\naspect of Hume\u2019s project in the Dialogues. If you\naccept that God\u2019s attributes are infinitely perfect, you are\nusing ordinary terms without their ordinary meaning, so that they do\nnot have any clear meaning. If you deny God\u2019s infinite\nperfection, you can give him understandable attributes, but only\nbecause they are amplified human characteristics. The closer Cleanthes\ncomes to regarding God\u2019s mind as like a human mind, the closer\nhe comes to regarding God\u2019s attributes as being like human\nattributes, and the less Godlike his \u201cGod\u201d is. We can only\ngive the idea of God intelligible content at the perilously high cost\nof denying that he is really God. To do so is to abandon God for some\nkind of superhero.\n\nAt the end of Part 8, which concludes their discussion of God\u2019s\nnatural attributes, Demea still thinks that Philo and he are partners.\nHe remains clueless about Philo\u2019s strategy until the very end of\nPart 11, when he finally realizes that he too is caught in the trap\nPhilo has sprung.\n\nDemea offers an a priori alternative to the design argument\nin Part 9. As noted earlier, it is an abbreviated, watered\u2013down\nversion of Clarke\u2019s cosmological argument. Although Cleanthes\nquickly scotches his lame efforts, Part 9 serves as an interlude\nbetween the previous discussion of God\u2019s natural\nattributes and the consideration of his moral attributes\nin Parts 10 and 11.\n8.3 God\u2019s Moral Attributes\n\nDemea begins the discussion in Part 10. Attempting to save face from\nhis recent drubbing, he suggests that we don\u2019t accept the truths\nof religion as a result of reasoning, but from what we feel\nwhen confronted with how helpless and miserable we are. Religion is\nbased on feelings of fear and anxiety that arise from awareness of our\n\u201cimbecility and misery\u201d (DCNR 10.1/68). Our forms of\nworship are attempts to appease unknown powers that oppress and\ntorment us.\n\nPhilo joins in, claiming he is convinced that\n\n\nthe best and indeed the only method of bringing everyone to a due\nsense of religion is by just representations of the misery and\nwickedness of men. (DCNR 10.2/68)\n\n\nThey proceed with a joint litany of the misery and melancholy of the\nhuman condition, topping each other with catalogues of woes. Demea\ndoes not realize that Philo may mean very different things by\n\u201cjust representation\u201d and \u201cdue sense of\nreligion\u201d than he does, so he fails to realize that Philo is\njust egging him on.\n\nPhilo maintains that we can\u2019t evade the facts of disease,\nfamine, and pestilence, except by \u201capologies, which still\nfarther aggravate the charge\u201d (DCNR 10.16/72). These apologies\nare theodicies\u2014systematic attempts to reconcile\nGod\u2019s goodness with the existence of evil. Demea is also\nscornful of theodicies, blissfully unaware that all too soon he will\nbe offering his own.\n\nCleanthes finally breaks in to say that he doesn\u2019t feel\noppressively anxious or miserable, and hopes that anguish isn\u2019t\nas common as they claim. But hoping that the extent of human\nmisery is not so widespread is not the same as proving that\nit is. Cleanthes is on weak ground. Philo capitalizes on it,\nchallenging Cleanthes to explain how God\u2019s mercy and benevolence\ncan possibly resemble human mercy and benevolence. Given God\u2019s\nomnipotence, whatever he wills happens, but neither humans nor animals\nare happy, so God presumably does not will their happiness.\n\nCleanthes\u2014\u201csmiling\u201d\u2014grants that if Philo can\nprove that mankind is \u201cunhappy or corrupted\u201d, he\nwill have succeeded in doing in religion (DCNR 10.28/74). He thinks he\nfinally has Philo on the ropes. In forcing a sceptic to prove a\npositive thesis, he must not only succeed at a difficult task, but\nviolates his scepticism in the process. Cleanthes fails to realize\nthat Philo will make his case without needing to prove anything, nor\ndoes he realize that he will soon be the one who needs a\nproof.\n\nDemea objects that Cleanthes exaggerates the dire consequences of\nacknowledging the human condition, and, despite his earlier vehement\nrejection of theodicies, offers his own. Sometimes called \u201cthe\nporch view\u201d, Demea\u2019s theodicy compares our experience of\nthe world to the world as a whole, including the afterlife, to trying\nto determine the structure of a large building from what little we can\nsee from its porch. From our perspective, we suffer, but from a longer\nview, either we don\u2019t suffer at all, or else our suffering is\nfor our greater good or for the greater good of the world.\n\nCleanthes retorts that Demea denies the facts, and offers only empty\nhypotheses, which, if intelligible at all, could only establish their\nbare possibility, but never their reality. The only way to respond to\nchallenges to God\u2019s benevolence is to deny that the human\ncondition is really so miserable.\n\nCleanthes has now put himself in the position in which he thought he\nhad put Philo. He must establish that the facts are as he claims, and\nPhilo is quick to stress how difficult this will be. By resting his\ncase on such an uncertain point, any conclusion he draws will be\nequally uncertain.\n\nPhilo then ups the ante by granting for the sake of argument that\nhuman happiness exceeds human misery. But if God is infinitely\npowerful, wise, and good, why is there any misery at all? There is no\nanswer that preserves all God\u2019s attributes, except to grant that\nthe subject exceeds the limits of our understanding.\n\nPhilo, however, refrains from pressing the question of\nintelligibility; he is more interested in building an even\nstronger case against Cleanthes\u2019 inference to God\u2019s\nbenevolence. Raising the ante higher still, he grants that\npain and suffering are compatible with God\u2019s infinite\npower and goodness. Cleanthes, however, must prove from the\n\u201cmixed and confused phenomena\u201d that God\u2019s\nbenevolence is actual, not merely possible. Doing so\nis doubly difficult, since any inference from finite to infinite is\nshaky at best, even when the data are \u201cpure and unmixed\u201d\n(DCNR 10.35/77).\n\nPhilo concludes by admitting, with less than complete sincerity, that\nwhile he was hard pressed to make his case against Cleanthes when the\ndiscussion concerned God\u2019s natural attributes, where his moral\nattributes are concerned, he is at ease. He challenges Cleanthes\n\u201cto tug the laboring oar\u201d and explain how he can infer\nGod\u2019s moral attributes from the facts about the human condition\n(DCNR 10.36/77).\n\nCleanthes \u201ctugs\u201d, but only for one short paragraph. He\nadmits that if we go beyond their usual meanings when we apply human\nterms to God, what we say is indeed unintelligible. Abandoning all\nhuman analogy is thus to abandon natural religion, but preserving it\nmakes it impossible to reconcile evil with an infinite God.\n\nCleanthes realizes he has painted himself into a corner, but once\nagain he thinks there is a way out. Abandon God\u2019s infinity;\nthink of him as \u201cfinitely perfect\u201d. Then\n\u201cbenevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may\nproduce just such a world as the present\u201d (DCNR 11.1/78).\n\nCleanthes doesn\u2019t realize that his new theory is worse than his\nold one. He also doesn\u2019t seem to remember Philo\u2019s earlier\nquestion about what \u201cfinitely perfect\u201d might possibly\nmean. Instead of God, he is now committed to some kind of superhero.\nBesides, the story he is telling is itself a theodicy. His\nsuperhero\u2019s limitations explain why he cannot eliminate evil, or\ncreate an evil\u2013free world.\n\nIn any case, Cleanthes is no better off than he was before.\nConjectures may show that the data are consistent with the\nidea of God, but are never sufficient to prove that he actually\nexists.\n\nPhilo then proceeds to outline four possible hypotheses about the\ncause of the universe: it is perfectly good; it is perfectly evil; it\nis both good and evil; it is neither good nor evil. Given the evil we\nknow exists, the data is at best mixed, so we can\u2019t\nestablish either of the first two hypotheses. The regularity and\nuniformity of the general laws we find in experience is sufficient to\ndiscount the third, so the fourth seems the most probable. On that\nhypothesis, the cause of the universe is entirely indifferent to the\namount of good and evil in the world.\n\nThese points about natural evil also apply to moral\nevil. We have no more reason to think that God\u2019s righteousness\nresembles human righteousness than we have to think that his\nbenevolence resembles human benevolence. We have even less reason, in\nfact, since moral evil outweighs moral goodness more than natural evil\noutweighs natural goodness.\n\nIn addition, Cleanthes\u2019 new form of anthropomorphism is saddled\nwith tracing moral evil back to God. Since every effect must have a\ncause, either the chain of causes goes back infinitely, or it stops\nwith the original principle that is the ultimate cause of all\nthings\u2014God.\n\nAt this point, Demea, who has become increasingly agitated during\nPhilo\u2019s speech, interrupts. He finally realizes that the case\nPhilo is making cuts against his own view as much as it cuts against\nCleanthes\u2019. Although it might appear that Demea can retreat to\nsome form of the theodicy he sketched earlier, the extent to which\nPhilo\u2019s argument upsets him suggests that he now realizes it is\ninadequate. If he leans on the mystery\u2013mongering he has\nprofessed until now, Philo has shown that, because of its lack of\nspecific content, it does not point exclusively to a good God. It may\njust as well commit him to a supreme being who is \u201cbeyond good\nand evil\u201d and is totally indifferent to morality. Commitment\nwithout content turns out to be no commitment at all. Demea realizes\nthis, dimly at least, as he leaves the conversation.\n8.4 The Conclusion: Part 12\n\nWith Demea\u2019s departure, Cleanthes and Philo are left to finish\nthe conversation. Their tone is conciliatory, so conciliatory that\nPhilo says he must \u201cconfess\u201d that although he is less\ncautious about natural religion than any other subject,\n\n\nno one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays\nmore profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself\nto reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature.\n(DCNR 12.2/89)\n\n\nPhilo\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d paves the way for a blockbuster\nthat has puzzled generations of readers. Philo seems to reverse field,\napparently recanting what he has argued for so forcefully. He grants\nCleanthes that \u201ca purpose, an intention, a design, strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker\u201d (DCNR\n12.2/89).\n\nHis remarks are, however, by no means straightforward. Some take\nPhilo\u2014and, by implication, Hume\u2014to be outing himself as a\ncloset theist. Others conclude that, since he holds all the cards at\nthis point, he can afford to be conciliatory. Read ironically, Philo\ncould be saying that while \u201ccareless and stupid\u201d observers\nare struck by purpose, intention, and design in the universe, careful,\ncritical, intelligent ones are not. But there is no need to force the\nirony here. Read straight, nature\u2019s \u201ccontrivance and\nartifice\u201d is \u201cinexplicable\u201d precisely because reason\ncan discover nothing about God\u2019s natural or moral attributes.\nEveryone\u2014even the stupid and careless\u2014can see that the\nparts of animals and plants have functions, and so can easily\nunderstand why \u201can anatomist, who discovered a new organ or\ncanal, would never be satisfied until he had also discovered its use\nand intention\u201d (DCNR 12.2/90).\n\nRecognizing that an organism\u2019s parts have\nuses\u2014functions\u2014says nothing about\nwhether their uses or functions are due to a designer\u2019s plan, so\nPhilo\u2019s acknowledgement implies nothing about whether he now\naccepts the design hypothesis. In fact, what he says here reiterates\nhis position in Part 8, that function alone is no proof of divine\ndesign:\n\n\nit is in vain \u2026 to insist on the uses of the parts of animals\nor vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain\nknow how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?\n(DCNR 8.9/61)\n\n\nNo one should deny design in this sense, so long as they do\nso \u201cwithout any religious purpose\u201d (DCNR 12.2/90). Far\nfrom reversing himself, then, Philo\u2019s position is continuous\nwith the line he has taken throughout the Dialogues.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Philo provides a diagnosis of the\ndispute. While the works of nature do bear \u201ca great\nanalogy\u201d to the products of human artifice, as its proponents\nclaim, there are also considerable differences. He suspects that this\nmay be the source of the intractability of the controversy, which\nsuggests that it may be at bottom \u201csomewhat of a dispute of\nwords\u201d (DCNR 12.6/92).\n\nBut verbal disputes can be resolved\u2014or\ndissolved\u2014by providing clear definitions. However, the\ndilemma about the content of our idea of God that Philo has\nconstructed clearly implies that such a constructive solution\nis not possible here.\n\nPhilo explains why only a critical solution is possible by\noffering a deeper diagnosis of the problem. Although the dispute may\nappear to be merely verbal, it is in fact \u201cstill more incurably\nambiguous\u201d, for\n\n\nthere is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of\nlanguage and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and\ncan never, by any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a\nreasonable certainty or precision. These are the controversies\nconcerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance. (DCNR\n12.7/92)\n\n\nThis is exactly what the dispute over intelligent design is about.\nAnalogies are always matters of degree, and the degrees of the\nqualities involved in the design argument aren\u2019t capable of\nexact measurement. The controversy thus \u201cadmits not of any\nprecise meaning, nor consequently of any determination\u201d (DCNR\n12.7/93). The dispute about design is actually worse than a\nverbal dispute.\n\nThat is why anyone, even an atheist, can say, with equal plausibility,\nthat \u201cthe rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and\nthe structure of human thought\u201d all \u201cprobably bear some\nremote analogy to each other\u201d (DCNR 12.7/93). That is why Philo,\nwithout renouncing any of his previous claims, can assent to the\n\u201csomewhat ambiguous, at least undefined\u201d, and, as we have\nseen, indefinable proposition into which\n\n\nthe whole of natural theology \u2026 resolves itself \u2026\nthat the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear\nsome remote analogy to human intelligence. (DCNR 12.33/101)\n\n\nAnything is like anything else in some remote respect. So the\nordering principle of the universe, if indeed there is one, can be\nabsolutely anything.\n\nIf this is all there is to \u201cthe whole of natural\ntheology\u201d, then we can certainly conclude that the\nargument\u2019s conclusion has no religiously significant content.\nBut it has no religiously significant content because Philo\u2019s\ncritique has drained it of any content whatsoever. Cleanthes\u2019\ndesign hypothesis is not just false; it is unintelligible.\n\nThe conversation began with all three participants agreeing that their\ntopic was to discuss only God\u2019s nature, not his\nexistence. As it concludes, it is no longer clear that these\nquestions are really so distinct as originally assumed. We don\u2019t\nknow what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about a God whose\nnature is inconceivable, incomprehensible, indeterminate, and\nindefinable. What, then, are we to make of the claim about his\nexistence?\n\nThe Dialogues draw out the consequences of Hume\u2019s\nstatement, in the first Enquiry, that\n\n\nthe idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good\nBeing, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and\naugmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.\n(EHU 2.6/19)\n\n\nIf we insist on \u201caugmenting without limit\u201d, we let loose\nthe moorings that give intelligible content to God\u2019s\nintelligence, wisdom, and goodness. If we stop short of the limit, we\nmay have content, but we have also lost God.\n",
