    "main_text": "The Critique of Logical Positivism || The Observational/Theoretical Distinction\n2.2 The Observational/Theoretical Distinction\n\nWhile the analytic/synthetic distinction appears to be justifiable in\nmodeling important properties of languages, the\nobservational/theoretical distinction does not fare equally well.\nWithin logical positivism, observation language was assumed\nto consist of names and predicates whose applicability or not can be\nascertained, under suitable conditions, by means of direct observation\n(such as using names and predicates for colors, shapes, sounds) or\nrelatively simple measurement (names and predicates for heights,\nweights, and sizes, for example). This was an epistemic position, of\ncourse, since it was sorting them out based upon their accessibility\nby means of experience. Both theoretical and dispositional predicates,\nwhich refer to non-observables, posed serious problems for the\npositivist position, since the verifiability criterion implies they\nmust be reducible to observables or are empirically meaningless. Karl\nPopper (1965, 1968), however, would carry the argument in a different\ndirection by looking at the ontic nature of properties.\n\nPopper has emphasized that we are theorizing all the time. Consider\nthe observation of a glass full of clear liquid. Suppose it\u2019s\nwater. Then it quenches thirst and extinguishes fires and nourishes\nplants. But what if it\u2019s alcohol instead? Just describing it as\n\u201cwater\u201d entails innumerable subjunctives about the kinds\nof responses it would display under a wide variety of test conditions.\nThey are the would be\u2019s of things of that kind.\nConsider the differences between basket balls, billiard balls, and\ntennis balls. Things of different kinds can do different things. Even\nthe seemingly simplest observation of a rabbit in the backyard, for\nexample, implies that it is going to display rabbit-like behavior,\nincluding eating carrots when my wife puts them out. It is going to\nhop around and create more rabbits. If it\u2019s a rabbit, it is\ngoing to have rabbit DNA. It will not turn out to be stuffed. And this\nsuggested that observational properties and predicates are\ndispositional, too.\n\nFrom the Humean epistemic perspective, observational, dispositional,\nand theoretical predicates are successively more and more\nproblematical in relation to their accessibility via experience. The\nobservational describe observable properties of observable\nentities; the dispositional, unobservable properties of\nobservable entities; and the theoretical, unobservable\nproperties of unobservable entities. Popper suggested that\nobservational and theoretical properties (gravitational strengths\nelectromagnet fields, and such) are ontologically dispositional, too\n(Popper 1965: 425). But if universals as properties that can\nbe attributed to any member of any possible world are dispositions and\nthe kind of property dispositions are does not depend upon the ease\nwith which their presence or absence can be ascertained, then\nnomological subjunctives and counterfactuals\u2014taken as\ninstantiations of lawlike generalizations for specific\nindividuals, places, and times\u2014might be explicable as displays\nof dispositions and of natural necessities (Fetzer 1981).\n",
