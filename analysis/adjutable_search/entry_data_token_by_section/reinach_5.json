    "main_text": "Investigations into the Material A priori || How the Law Misinterprets the Moral Significance of Deliberation\n3.3 How the Law Misinterprets the Moral Significance of Deliberation\n\n\nIn his essay, \u201cDeliberation: Its Ethical and Legal\nSignificance\u201d (1912/1913), Reinach observes that there are\ncontradictions in how we evaluate the moral significance of\ndeliberation. For example, we consider a crime more reprehensible if it\nis performed after deliberation, yet we also judge harshly one who\nperforms a crime without a second thought. Reinach noted that in the\nGerman law in his day killing without deliberation could mean as little\nas six months in prison where killing after deliberation would mean\ncertain capital punishment.\n\n\nReinach distinguishes between intellectual and volitional\ndeliberation. The former aims at apprehending what is the case, the\nlatter at apprehending what should be done. For example, upon arriving\nin a concentration camp, an inmate might intellectually deliberate\nabout the odds of successfully escaping. He might decide the odds are\nlow (say 1 in 20) yet still volitionally deliberate about whether he\nought to attempt to escape. Of the two, volitional deliberation is\npsychologically the more complex. Intellectual deliberation tends to\nculminate in conviction once we apprehend what is the case. In\ncontrast, volitional deliberation has no \u201cautomatic\u201d\nconclusion because the value of an act is subject to modification when\nit is connected to the real world of consequences. An act that appears\nhighly noble in itself may have such negative consequences that the\nvalue of actually undertaking it is modified to a disvalue. For\nexample, while escaping from a concentration camp may be good in\nitself, it may be a disvalue if escapes are punished through increased\ntorture and killing of remaining inmates. Moreover, even after one\nrightly discerns the value of an action per se and the value\nof undertaking a proposed action, experience shows that value\nperception does not compel either the will or the heart to provide a\nfitting response. That is, one might decide that escaping is\nwrong\u2014all things considered\u2014yet still attempt an escape to\nsave one's own life or sanity.\n\n\nThese facts about deliberation help us to recognize shortcomings in\nthe significance that the law attaches to deliberation. Reinach claims\nthat our belief that a crime is made worse by deliberation rests on the\nassumption that when an individual undertakes a project that is\ndisvaluable (say killing), the moral situation is worsened by knowledge\nof the relevant disvalue. That is to say, individuals are less culpable\nwhen they act in ignorance of the disvalue of their crime. Reinach\nfinds that deliberation is actually playing a symbolic role when its\nsignificance is interpreted in this fashion: it is taken to signify\nthat the individual had in fact apprehended the disvalue of an act\nprior to choosing to perform it. However, the connection between\ndeliberation and the perception of a disvalue is not a necessary\nconnection: one may apprehend a disvalue without deliberation, and one\nmay deliberate and still fail to apprehend a disvalue. Thus, the law is\nin no position to determine the precise significance of deliberation in\nan a priori fashion.\n\n\nIn fact, Reinach argues that the common-sense assumption that a\nreprehensible deed is actually worse when done without a second\nthought\u2014an assumption that contradicts the prevailing wisdom of\ncriminal law\u2014more properly reflects the direct moral significance\nof deliberation. It is good for people to consider what they do.\nFailure to deliberate about a crime implies either a fundamental\ndisregard for or an insensitivity to values\u2014and neither seems to\nreduce the culpability of a criminal act. Thus, Reinach concludes that\nthe law is mistaken in attaching more severe punishment to deliberate\nthan to non-deliberate crimes.\n",
