    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the syllogism played an important role in the\nWestern and Near Eastern intellectual traditions for more than two\nthousand years, but it was during the Middle Ages that it became the\ndominant model of correct argumentation. \n\nHistorically, medieval logic is divided into the old logic (logica\nvetus), the tradition stretching from Boethius (c. 480\u2013525)\nuntil Abelard (1079\u20131142), and the new logic (logica\nnova), from the late twelfth century until the Renaissance. The\ndivision reflects the availability of ancient logical texts. Before\nAbelard, medieval logicians were only familiar with Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation and Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge or Introduction to the Categories and not\nthe Prior Analytics, where Aristotle develops the theory of\nthe syllogism \u2014 though they did know something of his theory\nthrough secondary sources. Once the Prior Analytics\nreappeared in the West in the middle of the twelfth century,\ncommentaries on it began appearing in the late twelfth and early\nthirteenth centuries.\n\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the syllogism for assertoric (non-modal)\nsentences was a remarkable achievement and virtually complete in the\nPrior Analytics. To quote Kant, it was \u201ca closed and\ncompleted body of doctrine.\u201d Medieval logicians could not add\nmuch to it, though small changes were sometimes made and it was\nsystematized in different ways. It was not until the mid-fourteenth\ncentury, when John Buridan reworked logic in general and placed the\ntheory of the syllogism in the context of the more comprehensive logic\nof consequence, that people\u2019s understanding of syllogistic logic began\nto change.\n\nThe theory of the modal syllogism, however, was incomplete in the\nPrior Analytics, and in the hands of medieval logicians it\nsaw a remarkable development. The first commentators tried to save\nAristotle\u2019s original theory and in the course of doing so produced\nsome interesting logical theories, though in the end they were unable\nto make the system work. The next generation of logicians simply\nabandoned the idea of saving Aristotle and instead introduced new\ndistinctions and developed a completely new theory that subsumed the\nlogic of syllogisms.\n\nThe theory of the syllogisms developed independently in the Arabic\ntradition. Although there was some influence on the Latin tradition\nthrough Averroes, the dominant influence was Avicenna, who made\nseveral changes to Aristotle\u2019s theory and eventually became the sole\nauthority.\n",
