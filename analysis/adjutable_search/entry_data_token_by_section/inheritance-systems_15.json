    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || Units of Selection\n4.1 Units of Selection\n\nOnce it is accepted that more than one inheritance system or,\nalternatively, more than one independently inherited replicator may be\ninvolved in the reproduction of organisms (let alone multiple kinds of\nreplicators), questions about units of selection have to be addressed.\nAs each inheritance system can lead to hereditary variations, there\nmay be multiple lineages related to the production of a single\norganism and even single phenotypic traits. Evolution may happen in\neach lineage, and, in particular, each lineage may be\n\u201ctracked\u201d by natural selection.\n\nAccording to the traditional view in evolutionary theory selection\noperates on individual organisms. This view can incorporate multiple\ninheritance systems and channels within a single evolutionary process\nby viewing each inheritance system or channel as providing\ndevelopmental resources for the construction of individual organisms,\nleading to a single evolutionary process operating on lineages of\norganisms (qua interactors). Alternatively, lineages of phenotypic\ntraits that may be affected by more than one inheritance system or\nchannel may be subject to selection. According to this view phenotypic\ntraits are the targets or units of selection (Jablonka 2004).\n\nAccording to views that explain evolution in terms of replicators,\nmultiple kinds of replicators can support multiple and distinct\nevolutionary processes. The most prominent example of this line of\nthought concerns the view that genes are supplemented by memes that\nare units of cultural transmission, and each is manifested in a\nseparate evolutionary process: biological evolution operating on\nlineages of genes and cultural evolution operating on lineages of\nmemes. The extended replicator framework, in contrast, accepts the\npossibility of multiple kinds of replicators, but considers a single\nevolutionary process that determines the fate of lineages of different\nkinds of replicators by the success of their associated interactors\nand extended phenotypic effects (Sterelny et al. 1996: 378).\n",
