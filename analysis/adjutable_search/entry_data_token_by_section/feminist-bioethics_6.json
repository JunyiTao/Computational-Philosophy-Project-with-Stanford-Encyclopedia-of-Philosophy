    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis || Use of situated empirical and experiential knowledge\n3.2 Use of situated empirical and experiential knowledge\n\nFeminism is based on the observation that a person\u2019s experience\nis sexed and gendered and will differ in important ways depending on\nwhether that person is biologically male or female, or lives as a man\nor a woman. And because the organization of power is also gendered,\nthe issue of whose perspectives matter (or are noticed at all) will\nreflect the needs and demands of the most powerful. Feminist analyses\nare therefore sensitive to the stratifications that make it unlikely\nthat we (whoever we are) have an overarching view of even the most\nfamiliar situations. For bioethics, this limitation is compounded by\nits focus on life science and biomedical innovation, and on\ntechnologies and practices that have yet to establish themselves in\neveryday life. As an example, the growth of assisted reproductive\ntechnologies very obviously demanded new forms of health policy and\ngovernance. Less obviously, it also generated new professional and\nprivate identities and behaviors linked to being a parent, child, or\nsibling, novel forms of families (such as same-sex couples with\ngenetically related children), and rapidly evolving relationships\nbetween legislation and private life (Baylis & McLeod 2014).\n\nThe experiential basis of feminism and the novelty of the practices\nthat bioethics deals with both lead to the conclusion that normative\njudgments should be based in what Margaret Walker famously referred to\nas \u201cthe actual moral and social orders\u201d, i.e., knowledge\nof what is actually going on rather than assumptions about\nhow we think things might be (Walker 1998). Where that\nknowledge is not available it must be acquired. So, although much of\nbioethics took an empirical turn in the early 2000s, feminist\nbioethics has a particularly strong orientation towards the use of\nempirical methods to anchor any descriptive and normative claims in\nthe realities of natural, social, political, and institutional worlds.\nThere is also a leaning towards qualitative methods of inquiry to\ncapture morally salient differences that track not only with sex and\ngender, but also with class, ethnicity, sexuality, and so on. As a\nresult, some feminist bioethicists are involved in developing\nempirical methodologies to provide appropriate material for normative\nreasoning, while others work on clarifying the always problematic\nrelationship between empirical data and normative conclusions (Scully\n2016).\n",
