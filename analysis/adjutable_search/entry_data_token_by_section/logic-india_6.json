    "main_text": "Classical Period || Texts of the early classical period\n3.1 Texts of the early classical period\n\nThe texts relevant to the study of the development of logic during\nthis period may be divided into three kinds: those which have\narguments but which do not mention or discuss either argument or\ninference as such, those which mention or discuss inference as such\nbut do not mention or discuss arguments as such, and those which\nmention or discuss arguments and possibly also mention or discuss\ninference, and may even provide illustrations of either.\n3.1.1 Texts with arguments\n\nDuring this period polemical texts, which consist almost entirely of\narguments, start to appear. The earliest among these are texts\nattributed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (2nd century ce),\namong which are the\nM\u016bla-madhyama-kak\u0101rik\u0101 (Basic verses on\nthe middle way), the Vigrahavy\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304\n(Exclusion of disputes) and the\nVaidalya-prakara\u1e47a (Tract on pulverization).\nShortly thereafter came a text by \u0100ryadeva (c. 3rd century ce),\nsaid to be a student of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna,\nentitled \u015aataka-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise in one\nhundred verses), now extant only in its Chinese translation,\nB\u01cei l\u00f9n (\u767e\u8ad6). Of these texts, only\nthe Vaidalya-prakara\u1e47a is a prose text. While the\nothers are in verse, the Vigraha-vy\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304\nand the \u015aataka-\u015b\u0101stra, unlike the\nM\u016bla-madhyama-kak\u0101rik\u0101, are accompanied by the\nauthor\u2019s own commentary. Of the latter two, only the\nVigraha-y\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304 survives in its Sanskrit\noriginal. That the text has a commentary by its author and that both\nthe text and the commentary have survived in the original Sanskrit\noriginal make it the text which best reveals the reasoning of the\nperiod.\n\nThe text comprises seventy verses, each supplemented with the\nauthor\u2019s own commentary. The central question addressed is the\nclaim that nothing has a nature. The first twenty verses present four\narguments supporting the claim followed by six arguments against it.\nThe following fifty verses elaborate on the arguments and objections\nin the first twenty. The argumentation in the text is complex, using a\nnumber of different forms of argument and invoking or presupposing\nseveral principles of reasoning. To appreciate the kind of reasoning\nfound in this and the other texts mentioned above, we shall consider\nbriefly some of the arguments found in verses 31\u201350 and in their\naccompanying commentary.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s aim in the verses 31\u201350 is to show\nthat any argument to establish that there are\npram\u0101\u1e47as, means of epistemic cognition, ultimately\nleads to contradiction. He considers two cases: the case where it is\nmaintained that pram\u0101\u1e47as are established by other\npram\u0101\u1e47as and the case where each\npram\u0101\u1e47a establishes itself. The first case is\naddressed in verse 31 and its accompanying commentary, where\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that, if to establish a\npram\u0101\u1e47a other pram\u0101\u1e47as are\nrequired, then there results an endless (an-avasth\u0101 :\nliterally, foundationless) chain of such pram\u0101\u1e47as, in other\nwords, an infinite regress, which is taken to be an impossibility. The\nsecond case spans the remaining verses (33\u201350) and has two\nparts. In the first part (vv. 33\u201339), the proponent of the\nexistence of pram\u0101\u1e47as is challenged to justify\nwhy, of all the things whose existence is established by\npram\u0101\u1e47as, pram\u0101\u1e47as alone have\nthe peculiarity of not being established by (other)\npram\u0101\u1e47as. The opponent\u2019s answer is to\nmaintain that pram\u0101\u1e47as are not alone; light too,\nthe opponent claims, has the property of revealing the existence both\nof other things and itself. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna then puts forth four\narguments to show either that light does not reveal itself or that it\ndoes not reveal anything. In the second part (vv. 40\u201348),\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna maintains that a pram\u0101\u1e47a and\nits prameya, the object revealed by the\npram\u0101\u1e47a, are indistinguishable, which he seems to\nthink is absurd. He goes on to bolster this argument with what he\ntakes to be, and what he says is, another argument of the very same\nform, and which concludes father and his son, by dint of their\nrelation, are indistinguishable (vv. 49\u201350).\n\nWith the argumentative structure of the passage in mind, let us\nconsider three arguments in it which can be understood without\nelaboration. In verse 34, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says:\n\n\nFor fire does not illuminate itself. Just as a pot in the dark, not\nyet illuminated by fire, is not apprehended, and then at the very next\nmoment, illuminated by fire, is apprehended as existent, in the very\nsame way, if a fire were in the dark, not yet illuminated [and] at a\nlater time there were be [its] illumination by fire, then it would\nilluminate its existence. Yet that is not so.\n\n\nThe point is that, while the opponent holds that a\npram\u0101\u1e47a is self revealing, fire is not. When fire\nilluminates something, the thing the fire illuminates already exists\nin the dark before the fire\u2019s light reveals it; but a fire does\nnot exist in the dark before the fire\u2019s light reveals it. In\nthis way, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has shown that the opponent has failed\nto show that there is anything other than pram\u0101\u1e47as\nwhich are self revealing and that therefore the\npram\u0101\u1e47as remain exceptional.\n\nThis argument has, even to modern eyes, prima facie merit.\nHowever, the next two arguments do not. The argument in verse 35 is\nrestated in the\n\ncommentary as follows:\n\n\nAnd if, according to what you say, a fire illuminates its own\nexistence in the very same way as it illuminates the existence of\nother things too, will it not burn itself in the very same way as it\nburns other things too?\n\n\nThe argument is this: Fire illuminates other things and itself. Fire\nburns other things. Therefore fire burns itself. But fire does not\nburn itself. Therefore fire does not illuminate itself. The argument\nis framed as an argument by reductio ad impossibile with an\nargument by analogy within. As it happens, this argument by analogy is\neasily recast in the form of an analogical argument through\nsimilarity, one of two forms of argument treated as canonical in other\ntexts and to be discussed below. We can see that the argument here has\nno deductive cogency, if we render the argument as deductive by\nsupplying the following premiss: if fire bears one relationship to\nother things and to itself, then any other relationship it bears to\nother things it bears to itself.\n\nAn equally unconvincing argument is given in the next verse (36).\n\n\nAnd if, according to your thinking, fire illuminates its existence and\nthat of other things, would not darkness, being the opposite of fire,\nalso hide its existence and that of other things? Yet that is not\nobserved. In that case, your statement that fire illuminates its own\nexistence and that of other things is not true.\n\n\nThe argument here is also framed as an argument by reductio ad\nimpossibile with an argument by analogy within. As it happens,\nthis argument by analogy is easily recast in the form of an analogical\nargument through dissimilarity, the other of two forms of argument\ntreated as canonical in other texts and to be discussed below.\n3.1.2 Texts discussing inference\n\nWe know of four texts from this period which identify inference\n(anum\u0101na), as distinguished from argument\n(s\u0101dhana), as a means of epistemic cognition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a). They are the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on\nindividuation), a treatise of speculative ontology attributed to\nKa\u1e47\u0101da (c. 1st century ce), the\nSpitzer manuscript, a collection of fragments of a Sanskrit text (c.\n3rd century ce) of unknown authorship (Franco,\n2004, v. 1, 32\u201333), Sa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra\n(Aphorisms on release from bondage), an early Mah\u0101yana\ntext (between the 3rd and 5th centuries ce),\nalso of unknown authorship, and the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra (Sixty doctrines), a\nS\u0101\u1e43khya text attributed V\u0101r\u1e63aga\u1e47ya (4th\ncentury ce).\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra has passages which allude\nto inferences whereby one unobserved thing is inferred on the basis of\nsomething observed which bears one of five relations to the thing\ninferred (VS 9.18; Jambuvijaya (ed), 1961, 69; cp. VS 3.1.8). However,\nno examples are given. In contrast, six examples of inference are\nfound in the Spitzer manuscript among the surviving fragments\nreferring to the four means of epistemic cognition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47as) of perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na), analogy\n(aupamya) and tradition (aitihya) (Franco, 2003,\n126), though these inferences require piecing together (Franco, 2003,\n126\u2013136). A passage which also refers to the same\npram\u0101\u1e47as but with different words\n\nis found in the tenth and last chapter of the\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra, an early Mah\u0101yana\nBuddhist text, of unknown authorship, which survives only in a Tibetan\nand Chinese translation. The passage in question has also been\ntranslated into English and critically discussed by Yoshimizu (2010,\n142\u2013148). (See also Powers (trans.), 1991, 321ff.)\n\nFinally, there is the \u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra, which\nalso survives only in fragments, first collected by Frauwallner\n(1958), later expanded by Steinkellner (2017, Appendix 1). It defines\ninference (anum\u0101na) as follows: To infer is to establish\nsomething in the remainder, on the basis of a relation and something\nperceptible. One of the text\u2019s fragments lists six relations as\nones which underpin an acceptable inference. They are: the master\nservant relation (sva-sv\u0101mi-bh\u0101va-sa\u1e43bandha),\nthe matter alteration relation\n(prak\u1e5bti-vik\u0101ra-sa\u1e43bandha), the part whole\nrelation (k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-sa\u1e43bandha), the\ncause effect relation (nimitta-naimittika-sa\u1e43bandha),\nthe source product relation\n(m\u0101tr\u0101-m\u0101trika-sa\u1e43bandha), the\nassociation relation (sahac\u0101ri-sa\u1e43bandha) and the\nincompatibility relation\n(vadhya-gh\u0101taka-sa\u1e43bandha). Though each of the\nrelations is illustrated, no example of an inference using them is\nfound among the known fragments.\n\nWhat emerges from the passages of the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra and the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra and what is consistent with\nthose in the Spitzer manuscript and\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra is that inferences have the\nfollowing form:\n\ninferential syllogism\n\n\n\nproposition:\np has S \n\nreason:\nbecause p has H. \n\nrelation:\nA relation which possessors of H bear to possessors of S.\n \n\n\n3.1.3 Texts discussing argument\n\nInterest in the nature of argument itself appears also at this time.\nThe best known text from this period is the Brahmanical treatise\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on logic) by\nGautama, also known as Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da (c. 2nd ce),\nthe actual redaction of which is thought by\nsome to date to the third century ce. This\nconcerns topics primarily pertaining to epistemology and debate.\nThough a few aphorisms found in the first chapter of the first and\nsecond books speak of inference, much more attention is devoted to\ndebate, essentially all of both chapters of Book 5, the entirety of\nthe second chapter of Book 1, and several aphorisms in the first\nchapter of Book 1. Unfortunately, the text\u2019s aphorisms\n(s\u016btras) are often not much more than lists of terms.\nWith little discussion and few examples, it is hard to get a clear\nidea of what the key terms mean.\n\nSome light is shed on this work by a contemporaneous Buddhist work,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Vaidalya-prakara\u1e47a, mentioned\nabove. It is organized around the key terms listed in the first\naphorism of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.1.1). However, it\ndoes not explain the terms nor does it illustrate them. Instead, it\nsets out for each term arguments intended to show its incoherence. It\nis therefore rich in arguments, most of which are analogical. The\nauthor also judges a number of counter arguments as fallacious,\npointing out either that they are circular or that they lead to an\ninfinite regress.\n\nLess laconic passages pertaining to some of the same topics are found\nin the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101, Classical India\u2019s\nearliest medical text, conjectured by some to have been redacted in\nits current form at the beginning of first century ce.\nThe text has three relevant passages: a short\none concerned with inference (CS 1.11.21\u201322), a longer one\nconcerned with pram\u0101\u1e47as (CS 3.4.1\u201314 ) and a\nstill longer one concerned with argument (CS 3.8.16\u201367).\n\nNot all Buddhist texts from this period are hostile to argumentation.\nTwo works contain short passages with lists and classificatory\ndefinitions of terms pertaining to debate. One is the\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on release\nfrom bondage), mentioned above. Another is the\nAbhidharma-samuccaya (Compendium of the higher\nteachings), a text usually attributed to the Buddhist thinker,\nAsa\u1e45ga (5th century ce), whose fifth\nchapter has a section, its seventh, often referred to as\nV\u0101da-vini\u015bcaya (Settling on what debate\nis), also devoted to debate.\n\nIn contrast to the passages in the two texts just mentioned, which\nlist, and even sometimes gloss, terms ive other texts from this period\nnot only mention and sometimes discuss, terms pertinent to inference\nand debate the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra\n(Treatise on the stages of the practice of yoga), a work\ntraditionally attributed to Asa\u1e45ga, but now generally thought to\nbe by a number of authors, has a passage, usually referred to as\nHetu-vidy\u0101 (Science of reasons), which provides\nsome fifty examples of simple common sense inferences, all of which\nare easily recast in the form of the inferential syllogism given\nabove. The inferences are divided into five categories. While relation\nwords are used for each category, the logical force of these relations\nis not made clear. The inferences provided include ones such as the\ninference of fire from smoke, of the presence of a lion from its roar,\nof being sick from unusual eating practices, as well as inferences\nmore closely connected with Buddhist doctrine.\n\nThere are two other works which have passages pertinent to the study\nof the history of reasoning in India, both works attributed to\nAsa\u1e45ga. The first is the Xi\u01cen y\u00e1ng sh\u00e8ng\nji\u00e0o l\u00f9n\n(\u986f\u63da\u8056\u6559\u8ad6), or Treatise which\nreveals and disseminates the wise teachings, which is a condensed\nversion of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra, and the\nSh\u00f9n zh\u014dng l\u00f9n (\u9806\u4e2d\u8ad6),\nor Treatise on following the middle way, which seems to be a\ncommentary on the introductory verse of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nM\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101 (Katsura 1985 p.\n166).\n\nThe first work devoted entirely to argument and inference is the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n\n(\u65b9\u4fbf\u5fc3\u8ad6), or Treatise on the heart of\nmeans, translated into Chinese in 472 ce\nwithout attribution, though it later came to be attributed to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna. This text, translated into Sanskrit by G. Tucci\n(1929), is commonly known by scholars by the translation of its title\nby Tucci as Up\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya.\n\nFinally, shortly after Asa\u1e45ga, Vasubandhu (c. 5th century ce),\nanother Buddhist idealist, thought to be the\nyounger brother of the Asa\u1e45ga, wrote at least three works on\ndebate: V\u0101da-h\u1e5bdaya (Heart of debate),\nV\u0101da-vidh\u0101na (Precepts of debate) and\nV\u0101da-vidhi (Rules of debate). These texts have\nbeen lost, though fragments of the latter two, some in Sanskrit, many\nin Tibetan, have been collected (Frauwallner 1933, 1957; Ono 2020).\nAnother work, ascribed to Vasubandhu, which survives only in Chinese,\nis the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n\n(\u5982\u5be6\u8ad6), Treatise on truth. G. Tucci\n(1929), translating it back into Sanskrit, gave it the Sanskrit title\nTarka-\u015b\u0101stra, by which it is now generally known.\nHowever, as has been shown recently by Ono Motoi (Ono 2020 \u00a71),\nthis rendition is not correct.\n\nHaving surveyed the texts from the late preclassical period pertinent\nto the study of the development of logic, we now turn to the emergence\nof a canonical Indian syllogism.\n",
