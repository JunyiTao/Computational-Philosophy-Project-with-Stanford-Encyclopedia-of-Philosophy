    "main_text": "\n\nThe manifest appearance of function and purpose in living systems is\nresponsible for the prevalence of apparently teleological explanations\nof organismic structure and behavior in biology. Although the\nattribution of function and purpose to living systems is an ancient\npractice, teleological notions are largely considered ineliminable\nfrom modern biological sciences, such as evolutionary biology,\ngenetics, medicine, ethology, and psychiatry, because they play an\nimportant explanatory role. \n\nHistorical and recent examples of teleological claims include the\nfollowing: \n\n\nThe chief function of the heart is the transmission and pumping of the\nblood through the arteries to the extremities of the body. (Harvey\n1616 [1928: 49]) \n\nThe Predator Detection hypothesis remains the strongest candidate for\nthe function of stotting [by gazelles]. (Caro 1986: 663) \n\nThe geographic range of human malaria is much wider than the range of\nthe sickle-cell gene. As it happens, other antimalarial genes take\nover the protective function of the sickle-cell gene in \u2026 other\nwarm parts. (Diamond 1994: 83) \n\nDespite the substantial amount of data we now have on theropod\ndinosaurs, more information is necessary in order to determine the\nlikelihood that early feathers served an adaptive function in visual\ndisplay as opposed to other proposed adaptive functions such as\nthermoregulation. (Dimond et al. 2011: 62) \n\n\nThe ubiquity of claims such as these raises the question: how should\napparently teleological notions in biology be understood? \n\nMost post-Darwinian approaches attempt to naturalize teleology in\nbiology, in opposition to nineteenth-century viewpoints which grounded\nit theologically. Nevertheless, biologists and philosophers have\ncontinued to question the legitimacy of teleological notions in\nbiology. For instance, Ernst Mayr (1988), identified four reasons why\nteleological notions remain controversial in biology, namely that they\nare: \n\nvitalistic (positing some special \u2018life-force\u2019); \nrequiring backwards causation (because goal-directed explanations\nseem to use future outcomes to explain present traits); \nincompatible with mechanistic explanation (because of 1 and 2);\n\nmentalistic (attributing the action of mind where there is none).\n\n\n\nA fifth complaint is that they are not empirically testable (Allen\n& Bekoff 1995). The current philosophical literature offers both\nDarwinian and non-Darwinian accounts of teleology in biology that aim\nto avoid these concerns. In this article, we hope to bring some\nclarity to the contemporary debates over the role of teleological\nnotions in biology by sketching a taxonomy of the various accounts of\nbiological function on offer (see Allen & Bekoff 1995 for a more\ncomprehensive taxonomy that forms the basis of this presentation). We\nprimarily focus on naturalistic accounts of biological function, since\nthis is where we see the most lively and productive current debates\n(see, e.g., Garson 2016 for an extended survey). We also briefly\ndiscuss the notion of goal-directedness in section 2. \n",
