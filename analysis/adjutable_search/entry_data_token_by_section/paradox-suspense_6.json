    "main_text": "Suspense and Surprise\n7. Summary\n\n\nFour solutions to the paradox of suspense have been surveyed above:\nthe thought theory of entertained uncertainty, the desire-frustration\ntheory, the moment-by-moment forgetting view, and the emotional\nmisidentification view. The first two theories attempt to solve the\nparadox by explaining how it is that we feel suspense under conditions\nof certainty. The moment-by-moment forgetting theory effectively\ndenies that we do have knowledge of the outcome of a story, even if we\nhave read it before. And the emotional misidentification view denies\nthat we do feel suspense on repeated encounters with a narrative,\ndespite appearances. \n\n\nThe problems with the four theories are various, but it pays to note \nthat a theory of suspense should be able to do more than simply \nprovide a solution to the paradox of suspense; it should also be able\nto explain two additional facts. First, as noted above, suspense \noften diminishes after we have watched a movie, and continues to \ndiminish on subsequent viewings. Second, although narrative fiction \nis extremely effective at creating intense suspense, we rarely feel \nsuspense in our daily lives. \n",
