Challenging the \u201cbrain state theorists\u201d, who held\nthat every mental kind is identical to some yet-to-be-discovered\nneural kind, Putnam (1967) notes the wide variety of terrestrial\ncreatures seemingly capable of experiencing pain. Humans, other\nprimates, other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even\nmollusks (e.g., octopi) seem reasonable candidates. But then, for the\n\u201cbrain state theory\u201d to be true, there must be some\n\u201cphysical-chemical kind\u201d common to this wide variety of\npain-bearing species, and correlated exactly with each occurrence of\nthe mental kind. (This is a necessary condition of the hypothesized\ntype-identity.) Biological considerations speak intuitively against\nthis requirement. Neuroanatomy differs across terrestrial\nbrain-bearing creatures, especially at systems and circuit levels;\nfunction, especially sensory functions, are increasingly\n\u201ccorticalized\u201d as cortical mass increases across species.\nConvergent evolution generates similar phylogenic traits in organisms\nnot closely related due to their having to adapt to similar\nenvironments or ecological niches. Such realizers of the same function\nwill highly likely be distinct \u201cphysical-chemical\u201d\nkinds.\n\nIn addition, Putnam (1967) points out that early mind-brain identity\ntheorists insisted that these identities, while contingent, hold by\nvirtue of natural (scientific) law. So then any physically possible\npain-bearer must also be capable of possessing that physical-chemical\nkind. This point marks the introduction of the crucial distinction\nbetween multiple realization and multiple\nrealizability into the discussion, as well as the well-known\nphilosophers\u2019 imagined metaphysical possibilities. Silicon-based\nandroids, artificially intelligent electronic robots, and Martians\nwith green slime pulsating within their bodies all seem to be possible\npain realizers. But they lack \u201cbrain states\u201d comparable to\nours at any level of physical description. Further still, these\nmind-brain identity theories were supposed to be completely general.\nEvery mental kind was held to be identical to some neural\nkind. So the critic needs to find only one mental kind, shared across\nthese structure-types yet realized differently at the\nphysical-chemical level. Putnam (1967) acknowledges that the early\nidentity theories were being offered an empirical hypothesis. But this\nconsequence was \u201ccertainly ambitious\u201d, and almost\ncertainly false.\n\nOne quick word on this distinction between multiple\nrealizability and realization, for it marks a point\nwhere treatment of this topic in metaphysics and cognitive science\ndiverged. Metaphysicians, many of whom came quickly to reject the\ncontingent identity claims of the early mind-brain identity theorists\nin favor of the necessity of identity claims, focused on multiple\nrealizability, since the possibility of distinct physical\nrealizers of the same psychological kind was sufficient to block any\nsuch identity between realized kind and any one of its possible\nrealizers. Philosophers who took their cue from the cognitive and\nbrain sciences focused on proposed instances of multiple\nrealization, of actual instances of the relation among\nexisting cognizers. The emphasis in this entry will be on the latter\nissue, although some discussion of the metaphysical issues will arise\nin\n section 2\n and\n section 3\n below. \n\nStated in canonical form, Putnam\u2019s original multiple\nrealizability argument draws an anti-identity theory conclusion from\ntwo premises:\n\n(the multiple realizability contention) (At least) some mental\nkinds are multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds.\nIf a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical\nkinds, then it cannot be identical to any one (of those) specific\nphysical kind.\n(the anti-identity thesis conclusion) (At least) some mental kinds\nare not identical to any one specific physical kind.\n\n\nIn this simple form, this argument is deductively valid.\n\nJerry Fodor (1974) extended Putnam\u2019s initial argument by arguing\nthat reductionism imposes too strong a constraint on acceptable\ntheories in special sciences like psychology and economics. According\nto Fodor, reductionism is the conjunction of \u201ctoken\nphysicalism\u201d with the claim that there are natural kind\npredicates in an ideally completed physics corresponding to each\nnatural kind term in any ideally completed special science. He\ncharacterizes \u201ctoken physicalism\u201d as the claim that all\nevents that science talks about are physical events. Token physicalism\nis a logically weaker thesis than reductionism or type-type\nphysicalism. To illustrate why, consider the following string of\nnumerals:\n\n1 1 2\n\nThis string contains two types of numerals (1 and 2), but three tokens\nof the two types (two tokens of the numeral type 1 and one token of\nthe numeral type 2). Mental states are similarly ambiguous. When you\nand I both entertain the belief that Fodor advocated a Language of\nThought, one type of mental state is entertained, but two tokens of\nthat type occur (your belief state and my belief state). Type-type\nphysicalism insists that each mental state type is identical to some\nphysical state type, i.e., some specific brain state type on the\nmind-brain identity theory. This view runs afoul of multiple\nrealizability. But token physicalism only insists that each token\noccurrence of each type of mental state is identical to some token\noccurrence of some physical state type\u2014not necessarily a token\noccurrence of the same physical state type on each occasion, e.g.,\nwhen you and I, with our brains differentiated by our separate life\nhistories, entertain the same belief about Fodor\u2019s favorite\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nFodor gave reductionists the best-known account of reduction at that\ntime, the one at work in Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam\u2019s\n(1958; Fodor subtitles his 1974 as \u201cThe Disunity of Science as a\nWorking Hypothesis\u201d) and culminating in Ernest Nagel\u2019s\n(1961) \u201cderivability\u201d account of intertheoretic reduction.\nAccording to Fodor, this \u201cclassic\u201d account\n\u201cconnects\u201d disparate elements of the reduced and reducing\ntheories\u2019 vocabularies by way of \u201cbridge laws\u201d (not\nNagel\u2019s term!) and claims a reduction when the laws of the\nreduced theory are derived from the laws of the reducing theory plus\nthe bridge laws. According to Fodor (1974), if reductionism is to\nestablish physicalism, these cross-theoretic bridge laws must assert\n(contingent) identities of reduced and reducing kinds. But given\nmultiple realizability, the only way this can obtain is if the\nphysical science constituent of a psychophysical bridge law is a\ndisjunction of all the terms denoting possible physical realizations\nof the mental kind. Given the extent and variety of actual (not to say\npossible) physical realizations, Fodor insists that it is\noverwhelmingly likely that the disjunctive component will not be a\nkind-predicate of any specific physical science. It is also\noverwhelmingly likely that the disjunctive component will not appear\nin any genuine law of some specific physical science. Multiple\nrealizability thus demonstrates that the additional requirement\nimposed by reductionism, beyond that of token physicalism, is\nempirically untenable. (For a recent argument that multiple\nrealization is consistent with Oppenheim and Putnam\u2019s unity of\nscience via reductions, see Shapiro 2018)\n",
