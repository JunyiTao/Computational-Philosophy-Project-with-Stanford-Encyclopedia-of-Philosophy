    "main_text": "Historical particulars\n1. Historical particulars\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba lived in the first half of the fourteenth century,\nin Mithil\u0101, in northeastern India, where he was a prominent\nteacher, both of Ny\u0101ya, including logic and critical reasoning,\nand of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, the school known for Vedic\ninterpretation and ritual. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba endorses Ny\u0101ya in\nhis Jewel, but he was also a great master of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 is a\nlong-running tradition which, like Ny\u0101ya, pronounces on almost\nevery topic imaginable, along with Vedic ritual, the school\u2019s\nspecialization, as Ny\u0101ya\u2019s is critical reasoning.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba knew well M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka positions in\nboth of its major branches, the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da (after\nKum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da of the seventh century), and the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara (after Kum\u0101rila\u2019s renegade student,\nPrabh\u0101kara). And Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba may be supposed to have\nlearned the standard curricula in the grammarian literature, the epic\npoems, etc., some of which he cites, for example, P\u0101\u1e47ini\n(c. 500 BCE), and, in several places, the Bhagavad\nG\u012bt\u0101.\n\nBhattacharya cites data from literary and other sources, and in about\na dozen pages devoted to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (1958: 96\u2013109)\nprovides termini a quo et ad quem\u20141300 and 1350 for his\nperiod of flourishing\u2014from evidence that has not been corrected\nto date. Genealogical records kept in Mithil\u0101 suggest that he had\na wife and three sons and a daughter. One child was the famous\nNy\u0101ya author, Vardham\u0101na. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba apparently\nachieved quite some fame during his lifetime, referred to as\n\u201cjagad-guru,\u201d which would be the rough equivalent\nof \u201cDistinguished University Professor\u201d for the\neducational institutions of his time.\n\nAbout the person little more is known. About\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s reputation, Bhattacharya says (1958: 109):\n\u201cThe work of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba became highly popular very soon\nand was studied and commented upon in various centers of culture of\nIndia. It not only cast the works of the old school of logic into\noblivion but the neo-logical works of his predecessors also faded into\ninsignificance and were gradually were forgotten due to its\noverwhelming popularity and all-embracing character.\u201d Concerning\nthe part on inference, the learned sanskritist writes (1958: 107,\n108): \u201cThe second part on Anum\u0101na (Inference) is by far the\nmost popular, though the most intricate of the whole book. \u2026\nThe latest phase of Navyany\u0101ya studies in India for about two\ncenturies flowed through a large number of channels cut by single\nsentences or phrases of this part of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s work\nand by far the widest channel emerged from the general definition of\nFallacy. It has now assumed proportions through the efforts of all the\nbest Indian brains in Navyany\u0101ya, which is a world\u2019s wonder\nin the field of intellectual feats \u2026 .\u201d\n\nThe Jewel has four chapters, each devoted to a source of\nknowledge: perception, inference, analogy, and testimony. Within a\nchapter are clearly delineated sections on various subtopics including\nlong reflections, mainly in the first chapter, concerning knowledge in\ngeneral and how it is known. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba is lucid and precise,\nleading the reader into a preferred position by careful examination of\nalternatives.\n",
