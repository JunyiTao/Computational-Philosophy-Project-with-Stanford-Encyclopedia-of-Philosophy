Childhood Agency and Autonomy\n\nClearly children are capable of goal-directed behavior while still\nrelatively young, and are agents in this minimal sense. Respect for\nchildren\u2019s agency is provided in legal and medical contexts, in\nthat children who are capable of expressing their preferences are\nfrequently consulted, even if their views are not regarded as decisive\nfor determining outcomes.\n\nThe exercise of childhood agency will obviously be constrained by\nsocial and political factors, including various dependency relations,\nsome of them imposed by family structures. Whether there are special\nethical rules and considerations that pertain to the family in\nparticular, and, if so, what these rules or considerations are, is the\nsubject of an emerging field we can call \u2018family ethics\u2019\n(Baylis and McLeod 2014, Blustein, 1982, Brighouse and Swift 2014,\nHoulgate, 1980, 1999).\n\nThe idea that, in child-custody cases, the preferences of a child\nshould be given consideration, and not just the \u201cbest\ninterest\u201d of the child, is beginning to gain acceptance in the\nU.S., Canada and Europe. \u201cGregory K,\u201d who at age 12 was\nable to speak rationally and persuasively to support his petition for\nnew adoptive parents, made a good case for recognizing childhood\nagency in a family court. (See \u201cGregory Kingsley\u201d in the\nOther Internet Resources.) Less dramatically, in divorce proceedings,\nolder children are routinely consulted for their views about proposed\narrangements for their custody.\n\nPerhaps the most wrenching cases in which adults have come to let\nchildren play a significant role in deciding their own future are\nthose that involve treatment decisions for children with terminal\nillnesses. (Kopelman and Moskop, 1989) The pioneering work of Myra\nBluebond-Langner shows how young children can come to terms with their\nown imminent death and even conspire, mercifully, to help their\nparents and caregivers avoid having to discuss this awful truth with\nthem (Bluebond-Langner, 1980).\n\nWhile family law and medical ethics are domains in which children\ncapable of expressing preferences are increasingly encouraged to do\nso, there remains considerable controversy within philosophy as to the\nkind of authority that should be given to children\u2019s\npreferences. There is widespread agreement that most children\u2019s\ncapacity to eventually become autonomous is morally important and that\nadults who interact with them have significant responsibility to\nensure that this capacity is nurtured (Feinberg 1980). At the same\ntime it is typical for philosophers to be skeptical about the capacity\nfor children under the age of ten to have any capacity for autonomy,\neither because they are judged not to care stably about anything\n(Oshana 2005, Schapiro 1999), lack information, experience and\ncognitive maturity (Levinson 1999, Ross 1998), or are too poor at\ncritical reflection (Levinson 1999).\n\nMullin (2007, 2014) argues that consideration of children\u2019s\ncapacity for autonomy should operate with a relatively minimal\nunderstanding of autonomy as self-governance in the service of what\nthe person cares about (with the objects of care conceived broadly to\ninclude principles, relationships, activities and things).\nChildren\u2019s attachment to those they love (including their\nparents) can therefore be a source of autonomy. When a person, adult\nor child, acts autonomously, he or she finds the activity meaningful\nand embraces the goal of the action. This contrasts both with a lack\nof motivation and with feeling pressured by others to achieve outcomes\ndesired by them. Autonomy in this sense requires capacities for\nimpulse control, caring stably about some things, connecting\none\u2019s goals to one\u2019s actions, and confidence that one can\nachieve at least some of one\u2019s goals by directing one\u2019s\nactions. It does not require extensive ability to engage in critical\nself-reflection, or substantive independence. The ability to act\nautonomously in a particular domain will depend, however, on whether\none\u2019s relationships with others are autonomy supporting. This is\nin keeping with feminist work on relational autonomy. See the entry on\n Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy.\n\nThe orthodox position that children are paradigmatic examples of a\nlack of autonomy has begun to change as more philosophers argue that\neven children far from the cusp of adulthood may be capable of acting\nautonomously in some areas of their lives (Bou-Habib and Olsaretti\n2104, Hannan 2018a, Mullin 2007, 2014). However, others argue that\neven when children have capacities like those possessed by adults,\nsocieties shold protect children rather than deferring to their\nautonomy when children\u2019s decisions might lead to very negative\nconsequences for them (Betzler 2022, Claassen and Anderson 2012,\nFranklin-Hall 2013).\n\nChildren\u2019s autonomy is supported when adults give them relevant\ninformation, reasons for their requests, demonstrate interest in\nchildren\u2019s feelings and perspectives, and offer children\nstructured choices that reflect those thoughts and feelings. Support\nfor children\u2019s autonomy in particular domains of action is\nperfectly consistent with adults behaving paternalistically toward\nthem at other times and in other domains, when children are\nill-informed, extremely impulsive, do not appreciate the long-term\nconsequences of their actions, cannot recognize what is in their\ninterest, cannot direct their actions to accord with their interests,\nor are at risk of significant harm (Mullin 2014).\n",
