To begin with the latter, consider the following cases of\ntestimony (based on Callahan 2018):\n\n\nNina wants to know whether the law permits deducting expenses incurred\nfor charitable work when filing taxes. She asks a specialist, who\ntells her it\u2019s okay. Nina thus comes to believe the law permits\ndeducting the expenses.\n\nAleksi wants to know whether it is, as a rule, morally wrong to\nmislead others by omitting unfavorable details. He asks a wise friend,\nwho says it is. Aleksi thus comes to believe that it is as a rule\nmorally wrong to lie by omission.\n\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that both Nina and Aleksi come to know what they\nwanted by testimony. (Set aside any general worries about testimonial\nknowledge, and assume that in both cases they have sufficient reason\nto trust the word of the person they\u2019re asking.) It seems to\nmany that while what Nina does is entirely unproblematic, there is\nsomething off, if not outright wrong, with Aleksi\u2019s moral\ndeference. More generally, one commonly accepted qualification is\nthat moral deference is problematic when one forms a moral belief\nsolely on the basis of testimony, instead of, for example, reflecting\non the matter as a result of another\u2019s expressing an opinion.\nAnother common qualification is that problematic testimony concerns\npure moral content whose truth doesn\u2019t hang on empirical\nassumptions. It is not problematic to change one\u2019s opinion about\nan impure moral matter on the basis of testimony that concerns a\nmorally relevant empirical fact, as when someone comes to believe it\nis wrong to eat fish on the basis of being informed that fish feel\npain (Fletcher 2016). In brief, it seems that you shouldn\u2019t\nchange your mind on a purely moral matter just because someone tells\nyou (even if you have no particular reason to doubt them).\n\nBut what, if anything, is wrong with moral deference? Guy Fletcher\nargues that the link between sentiments and morality explains the\nunease. First, he holds that \u201cMoral sentiments are at least\ndifficult to form on the basis of pure, direct, testimony\u201d\n(Fletcher 2016: 60). This parallels other cases: I can\u2019t feel\nadmiration for a painting just because you tell me it\u2019s worth\nadmiring, for example. Second, as discussed in Section 2, there are\nmany metaethical views on which moral judgments either (partially or\nwholly) consist in sentiments or link up with sentiments. If so,\ntestimony-based judgments are either impossible or defective. However,\nLaura Frances Callahan (2018) points out that if one did form\nmoral sentiments purely on the basis of testimony, our sense that\nsomething fishy is going on wouldn\u2019t go away. In fact, it would\nbe even more alarming if someone came to be passionate about some\nmoral matter just because somebody else said it was wrong!\n\nA very different popular explanation of the problematic nature of\nmoral deference appeals to the notion of moral understanding: while we\ncan acquire moral knowledge by testimony, we will not (easily\nor at all) acquire moral understanding that way, and moral\nunderstanding is important for moral worth, or deserving credit for\none\u2019s action (Hills 2009). For Alison Hills (2016), moral\nunderstanding is a form of \u201ccognitive control\u201d, roughly\nthe ability to grasp and articulate why certain features make an\naction (say) wrong, and consequently what would need to be different\nfor it to be right. Callahan (2018) argues that having the kind of\ncognitive abilities that Hills highlights doesn\u2019t suffice for\nmoral worth, since possessing them is consistent with being motivated\nby features that are not reasons for acting. On her alternative\nsentimentalist account, moral understanding itself requires also\nhaving fitting affective and motivational responses towards the\nunderstood propositions and the relevant explanatory relationships\n(Callahan 2018: 451\u2013452). For example, understanding that a\npractice is wrong because it\u2019s racist involves a disposition to\nbe angry or sad about it because it\u2019s racist (or about the\nfeatures that make it racist), and a willingness to abstain from or\nintervene in the practice. The problem with deference, then, is that\nit disincentivizes the sort of reflection and inquiry that would give\nrise to such responses in addition to the relevant cognitive abilities\n(Callahan 2018: 454\u2013456; for a very different sentimentalist\ntake, see Howard 2018).\n\nFinally, even those who don\u2019t believe that sentiments are\nconstitutive of moral understanding may believe that they help bring\nit about. Thus, Brady (2013) argues that the positive epistemic role\nof emotions in morality consists largely in their role in\nmotivating us to find out why some things are right or\nwrong.\n",
