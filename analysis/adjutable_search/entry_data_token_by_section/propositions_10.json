    "main_text": "Linguistic Problems? || The Syntax Response\n5.4 The Syntax Response\n\nNext, following Jeffrey King (2002), the propositionalist might give a\npurely syntactic answer to the problems. King (pp. 345\u20136)\nclaims, first, that there is a very simple syntactic explanation for\nthe substitution failures that produce ungrammaticalities: such verbs\ndon\u2019t take NP complements at all, and so don\u2019t take\nnominal complements, which are NP complements. (A verb can take\nthat-clause complements without taking NP complements,\nbecause that-clauses are not NPs.) One might say something\nsimilar, for example, about why we cannot substitute descriptions for\nnames in apposition (e.g., \u2018The philosopher Plato believed in\nuniversals\u2019 is true but \u2018the philosopher the teacher of\nAristotle believed in universals\u2019 is not true.) King claims,\nsecond, that the other class of failures are explained by shifts in\nverb meanings (i.e., because of objectivization). These shifts are due\nto syntactical matters, in particular the syntactic category of the\nverb complement. If the complement is an NP, the verb has an object\nmeaning. If it is a that-clause, it has the content meaning.\nKing recognizes the need for qualifications: verbs in the problematic\nclass can have the content reading with certain special NPs, e.g.,\nquantifiers (\u2018everything Bill holds, Bob holds\u2019), and\nanaphoric pronouns (\u2018I hold that, too\u2019.). In the final\nanalysis, King claims only that all the syntactic properties of the\ncomplement (and not just its general syntactic category) determine the\nverb\u2019s meaning when taking that\n complement.[8]\n",
