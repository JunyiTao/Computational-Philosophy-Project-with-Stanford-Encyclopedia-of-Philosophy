    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Free Will\n3.2 Free Will\n\nClarke attached great importance to the issue of free will, and he may\nhave introduced the modern philosophical meaning of the term\n\u201cagency\u201d (Schneewind 1997, 313). In his philosophical\nwritings, he argues that freedom of the will involves a libertarian\npower of self-determination. However, in the sermon \u201cOf the\nLiberty of Moral Agents,\u201d he claims that the \u201cTrue liberty\nof a Rational and Moral Agent\u201d is \u201cbeing able to follow\nright Reason only, without Hindrance or Restraint\u201d (W\n1.219). Similarly, in that sermon Clarke calls acting as one pleases\n\u201cmere physical or\nnatural liberty\u201d (which humans and non-human animals\nhave), so he seems to accept a definition of liberty that is\ncompatibilist (W 1.218). Elsewhere he argues that human freedom\nrequires a self-determining will that could freely assent or refrain\nfrom assenting to the mind\u2019s judgments; this is a freedom of\nchoosing and not a freedom of acting, such that a prisoner in chains\n\u201cwho chooses or endeavors to move out of his place is therein as\nmuch a free agent as he that actually moves out of his place\u201d (D\n75, W 2.566). Clarke does not explicitly reconcile these\nincompatibilist and compatibilist approaches. One way to do so is to\nmake the libertarian power of self-determination a necessary condition\nfor the compatibilist understanding of freedom as following reason\nwithout restraint. Clarke also entertains a third notion of freedom:\nfreedom is \u201ca principle of acting, or power of beginning motion,\nwhich is the idea of liberty\u201d (D 54, W 2.553). The ability to\nbegin motion marks freedom as a power only held by non-material\nagents, because matter has no power of self-motion. This third\ndefinition is libertarian and is probably the most important of the\nthree to Clarke\u2019s project (Harris 2005, 46\u201361; Greenberg 2013,\n249\u2013251).\n\nClarke\u2019s primary defense of libertarian freedom involves\nclarifying the relationship between the will and the judgment. In\norder to will, one must have a judgment about what to do and the power\nto choose in accordance with that judgment. This power to choose is\nprovided by the will. The will is not to be identified with the last\njudgment of the understanding nor is it a volition caused by a judgment.\nThose (like Hobbes) who thought so were guilty of basic philosophical\nerrors. If they maintained that the content of the evaluative\nproposition is either identical with the volition or causes it, then\nthey were confusing the \u201cmoral motive\u201d with the\n\u201cphysical efficient,\u201d the physical efficient being the\nelement of the cause that provides the active power (D 73, W 2.565).\nBecause the moral motive is simply an abstract object (a proposition)\nand abstract objects are causally inert, the moral motive cannot cause\nanything. On the other hand, if Clarke\u2019s opponents maintained\nthat, not the evaluative proposition, but one\u2019s perceiving,\njudging or otherwise believing it is the cause (or a partial cause) of\nvolition, then they were falling foul of a basic causal principle.\nAgainst Descartes, Clarke insisted that judging, i.e., assenting to\nwhat appears true and dissenting from what appears false, is not an\naction but a passion. But what is passive cannot cause anything\nactive. So, there is no causal link between evaluation and volition,\nor, as Clarke put it, between \u201capprobation and action\u201d (D\n126, W 4.714). In general, there is no causal link between previous\nnon-volitional mental states, all of which are passive, and any\nvolition (Vailati 1997, 82\u201384).\n\nJonathan Edwards (1754, 222\u2013223) argued that Clarke was\ncommitted to an infinite regress of volitions. Because each volition\nis active, it must be caused by something active; but every other\npurported motivation is passive, so each volition is caused by a\nprevious volition, and so on ad infinitum. However, Clarke\ndid not believe that each volition was caused by a previous volition,\nbut rather each volition is caused by the will itself. This raises a\ndifferent problem, noticed by Leibniz: because the conditions for the\nwill choosing in accordance with the judgment are exactly the same as\nwhen it refrains from choosing, there is no explanation for why it\ndoes one rather than the other, in violation of the principle of\nsufficient reason (L 4.1, W 4.612; L 5.14, W4.634). Clarke never\nprovided a satisfactory response to this charge; his best attempt is\nhis claim that to deny this account would lead to accepting passive\nagency, which is a contradiction.\n\nDivine freedom raises new problems for Clarke. For one, human and\ndivine freedom are perhaps in tension with God\u2019s knowledge of\nfuture events. Against the claim that divine foreknowledge is\nincompatible with free will, Clarke objected that because knowledge\ndoes not affect the thing known, our free choices are unaffected by\ndivine omniscience (D 75\u201378, W 2.566\u2013568). A second\nproblem is that God always does what is best, so God cannot refrain\nfrom acting on his judgment of what is best, and thus acts\nnecessarily, which Clarke claims is a contradiction (D 83\u201386, W\n571\u2013573). Clarke could rely, again, on the passivity of judgment\n(or the difference between physical causes and moral reasons) to block\nthe move that God\u2019s judgment determines God\u2019s choice.\nThus, even though we have complete certainty that God always does what\nis best, it does not follow that God doing the best is necessitated by\nGod\u2019s judgment of what is right to do. This response is nested\nin Clarke\u2019s official response, which is to distinguish\nGod\u2019s metaphysical attributes from his moral attributes. Because\nGod\u2019s will is not determined by God\u2019s knowing that an\naction is the best, our certainty that God will do what is best is due\nto our confidence in \u201cthe unalterable Rectitude of his\nWill\u201d and not a necessity of his nature (D 86\u201387, W\n573). In other words, it is a moral necessity and not a metaphysical\nnecessity. A third and related problem is that when God created the\nworld, he did what was best to do, but had a choice among an infinite\nnumber of equally best ways of creating the world because he could\nplace the world anywhere in space and could create it at any time.\nThus, it does not follow from God\u2019s perfect judgment combined\nwith his infinite power to create that God should create the world in\na particular way. Although this bothered Leibniz because it conflicts\nwith his account of the principle of sufficient reason, Clarke fails\nto see any problem (C 4.18\u201320, W 4.626).\n",
