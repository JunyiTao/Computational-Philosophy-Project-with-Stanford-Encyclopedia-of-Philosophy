    "main_text": "\n\nConstructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional\ncounterpart, classical mathematics, by the strict interpretation of\nthe phrase \u201cthere exists\u201d as \u201cwe can\nconstruct\u201d. In order to work constructively, we need to\nre-interpret not only the existential quantifier but all the logical\nconnectives and quantifiers as instructions on how to construct a\nproof of the statement involving these logical expressions. \n\nIn this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on\nthe BHK-interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers. We\ndiscuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics, with\nparticular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop\nand Per Martin-L\u00f6f, which can be regarded as minimal constructive\nsystems. We then outline progress in (informal) constructive reverse\nmathematics, a research programme seeking to identify principles, such\nas Brouwer\u2019s fan theorem, that, added to the minimal\nconstructive varieties, facilitate proofs of important analytic\ntheorems. After a brief discussion of constructive algebra, economics,\nand finance, the entry ends with two appendices: one on certain\nlogical principles that hold in classical, intuitionistic, and\nrecursive mathematics and which, added to Bishop\u2019s constructive\nmathematics, facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of\nanalysis; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development\nof general topology. \n",
