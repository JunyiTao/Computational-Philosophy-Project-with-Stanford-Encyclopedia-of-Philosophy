    "main_text": "Disability in Contemporary Theories of Justice || Disability and Contemporary Social Contract Theories\n4.1 Disability and Contemporary Social Contract Theories\n\nWithin social contract theories, a distinction is often drawn between\ncontractarian/Hobbesian and contractualist/Lockean accounts (see SEP\nentry on\n contractarianism).\n One way to characterize this distinction is in terms of the\nparties\u2019 motivation and interaction. In the former, they are\nnarrowly self-interested and hard-bargaining; in the latter, their\nself-interest is tempered or balanced by their commitment to\njustifying themselves to others, and they proceed by deliberating\nrather than by bargaining. This distinction is often formulated in\nterms of a distinction between (merely) rational agents, and\n\u201creasonable\u201d agents.\n\nA Rawlsian approach might seem more congenial than a Hobbesian\napproach to people with disabilities. It derives the basic structure\nof society from a hypothetical choice situation, the Original\nPosition, in which a veil of ignorance precludes reliance on the\ncontractors\u2019 actual limitations\u2014limitations that a\nHobbesian contractor might ruthlessly (albeit rationally, if not\nreasonably) exploit (cf.\n note 10).\n Although the parties themselves are motivated exclusively by\nconsiderations of self-interest, which Rawls understands in terms of\nthe fulfillment of two higher-order interests (see SEP Entry on\n the original position),\n the informational constraints of the Original Position compel the\nparties to motivate as if they are reasonable, at least in\nthe sense that it compels them to be impartial between the claims of\nall who will be subject to the principles they choose.\n\nBut even if Rawlsian contractors do not know their specific\nlimitations, they do know that they, or the individuals they\nrepresent, are not permanently disabled. Rawls stipulated that the\nidealized society whose \u201cbasic structure\u201d was the subject\nof hypothetical agreement was restricted to members who would be\n\u201cfully-cooperating\u201d over the course of their adult lives.\nRawls assumed that this restriction would exclude people with severe\nand permanent physical and mental disabilities (Rawls 1993:\n18\u201320). He did not defend that assumption, nor provide for the\nrepresentation of those people in the process by which the basic\nstructure of society is to be determined. Instead, he consigned their\nfate to the later, legislative phase. Rawls also restricted\nparticipation in the Original Position to those with two \u201cmoral\npowers\u201d: the capacity to form and revise one\u2019s own\nconception of the good; and the capacity for a sense of justice, the\ncapacity to act on and apply fair terms of cooperation\n(ibid.). It is doubtful that these powers can be attributed\nto people with the most severe intellectual and psychiatric\nimpairments, although some philosophers and disability scholars have\nargued that a just society should treat all human beings as having the\npotential to develop such functioning (Wong 2007, 2009).\n\nDisability scholars have been particularly critical of these\neligibility conditions for the Original Position. If the deliberators\nin the Original Position do not believe that they could be\nrepresenting, or could turn out to actually be, people with\n\u201csevere and permanent\u201d disabilities when the veil is\nlifted, they will have no prudential reason to choose a basic\nstructure for their society that will provide for the inclusion of\nthose people. Indeed, insofar as such measures would impose costs on\npeople with non-disabilities, the parties will have prudential reasons\nnot to support such measures, since doing so would undermine\nthe interests of people whom they know they could represent (the\nable-bodied on whom the costs are imposed) for the sake of those whom\nthey explicitly know they don\u2019t represent (the disabled for whom\nthe costs are imposed).\n\nSeveral philosophers sympathetic to the Rawlsian framework have\nsuggested modifications that would give people with disabilities a\ngreater and more direct role in the social contracting process. Some\nhave argued that the \u201cfull cooperation\u201d requirement, and\nthe kind of reciprocity it involves, can be liberally interpreted so\nas not to exclude most people with significant physical disabilities\n(Hartley 2009b; Stark 2009). Henry Richardson has gone even further,\nmaintaining that \u201cRawls\u2019 arguments making use of the\ndevice of the [Original Position] do not essentially depend on any\nreciprocity premise\u201d (2006: 427). He examines modified versions\nof the Original Position that drop the assumption that no one has\nsevere and permanent disabilities. He contends that with such\nmodifications, the Original Position can yield principles more\nsensitive to disability concerns about the continuous nature of\nabilities, the stigmatization resulting from false dichotomization,\nand the exclusion of severely disabled human beings.\n\nIn response, Martha Nussbaum (2006b: 490\u2013498) concedes that\nRichardson\u2019s proposed reconstruction of Rawls would largely\navoid the exclusionary features of the OP to which disability scholars\nhave objected. But she argues that this reconstruction is a more\nradical departure from Rawls than Richardson acknowledges. She\nsuggests that the theory loses its contractual character if it\ndispenses, per Richardson, with the reciprocity requirement and the\nassumption that the contractors have roughly equal physical and mental\npowers.\n\nRawls\u2019 \u201cmoral powers\u201d condition has posed further\nproblems. Harry Brighouse (2001) observes that modifying the\ncooperation requirement still excludes those whose cognitive\nimpairments preclude their possession of the two moral powers. Sophia\nWong (2009, 2007) argues that those powers can be acquired by people\nwith severe intellectual impairments, with adequate social support.\nLeslie Francis (2009) and Anita Silvers (Silvers and Francis 2009)\ncontend that many individuals with severe cognitive impairments can\ncollaborate with others to construct individualized, authentic\nconceptions of the good. Silvers and Francis (2005) and Christie\nHartley (2009a) also maintain that people with severe intellectual\nimpairments can be represented adequately in a contracting process\nthat consists in trust-building more than hard bargaining, even if\nthey cannot participate in it personally.\n\nOthers have argued that exclusion from the Original Position need not\nadversely affect people with disabilities or treat them with\ndisrespect. Adam Cureton (2008) argues that the exclusion of people\nwith severe disabilities from the Original Position is just part of\nits idealization, and does not diminish the urgency or priority of\ntheir claims. Cynthia Stark (2007) proposes lifting the\nfull-cooperation requirement to include people with disabilities at\nthe second stage of Rawlsian deliberation, where the society\u2019s\nconstitution is established and where the hypothetical decision makers\nacquire some knowledge about the resources, development level, and\nother characteristics of their society.\n\nThe plausibility of these responses to Rawls depends to some extent on\nwhich version of the Original Position we consider. Rawls made a\nchange in his presentation of the Original Position in his\nRestatement (2001) that is especially pertinent to people\nwith cognitive disabilities. He emphasized that the participants in\nthe Original Position are representatives of people in the future\nsociety, not people living in the future society denied knowledge of\ntheir social position. If representatives were made to take into\naccount the possibility that those they represent might be disabled,\nthis might help to ensure that the interests of the disabled were\nrepresented. It would only do so, however, if the contractors have the\nability to imagine the very different embodiments of people with a\nvariety of disabilities, an ability feminist critics of Rawls have\nquestioned with respect to men representing women (Young 1990;\nBenhabib 1992; Okin 1994). The strictly representational role of\nparticipants in the Original Position would also avoid the conflict of\ninterest faced by cognitively unimpaired individuals representing\nthemselves and cognitively impaired individuals.\n\nMore broadly, philosophers have varied widely in their optimism about\nthe prospects for including people with disabilities in contractarian\nor contractualist deliberations. On the one hand, Lawrence Becker\n(2005) suggests that even selfish, hard-bargaining contractarians (his\n\u201ctough crowd\u201d) would accept an expansive notion of\n\u201creciprocity\u201d, one that would ensure adequate provision\nfor people with disabilities in the scheme of social cooperation they\nadopt. Their acceptance of reciprocity would arise from recognition of\nthe needs and vulnerabilities they and their loved ones have or will\nlikely acquire. That recognition places a premium on social provisions\nfor health. \n\n\nEven for the tough crowd, health is now ripe for inclusion in the list\nof basic goods. And it may be that a robust social commitment to\nhealth will address questions of justice for the disabled\u2014as\nlong as we are careful to include fundamental aspects of psychological\nhealth (i.e., those associated with active rational agency\u2026.\n(2005: 35) \n\n\nMembers of the tough crowd may not be so careful, however. Indeed,\nsome may not even regard \u201cactive rational agency\u201d as a\nmatter of health as they more narrowly construe it, with an emphasis\non physical survival and comfort. In contrast to Becker, Eva Kittay\n(1999) holds that even the most liberal interpretation of Rawls\u2019\nscheme will not be sufficiently responsive to the egalitarian concerns\nthat motivate his theory. Rawls\u2019 assumption that the\nparticipants in the original position are or represent fully\nproductive members of society neglects the fact of pervasive,\ninevitable human dependency. \u201c[T]hose within relationships of\ndependency fall outside the conceptual perimeters of Rawls\u2019\negalitarianism\u201d (1999: 79).\n\nAnother debate within contractarian theories that has particular\nrelevance to disability concerns the scope of justice itself: Is\njustice concerned only with the distribution of social goods, or also\nwith the rectification of \u201cnatural inequalities\u201d (Pogge\n1989: 44\u201347). Pogge (1995) argues that in the Original Position,\nit would be irrational for parties to ignore the contribution of\nnatural advantages to the well-being (understood in terms of the\nfulfillment of the two \u201chigher-order interests\u201d) of\nprospective citizens, since from that standpoint, it is just as bad to\nbe disadvantaged by uncompensated disabilities as it is to be\ndisadvantaged (to the same degree) by a small share of social primary\ngoods. But Pogge claims that attempting to eliminate those\ninequalities would go beyond the scope of justice. Some philosophers\nargue, however, that many natural inequalities are within the scope of\njustice, and that health care to mitigate them is a requirement of\njustice (Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000).\n\nOther philosophers and disability scholars would deny that the\ninequalities associated with impairments can be regarded as\n\u201cnatural\u201d (Amundson 1992; Wasserman 2001). In questioning\nthe very notion of \u201cnatural inequalities\u201d, they join a\nbroader philosophical debate about whether it is possible to draw a\ncoherent distinction between natural and artificial or social\ninequalities (see Lippert-Rasmussen 2004; Nagel 1997; Pogge 2004a,b;\nAas and Wasserman,\n 2016).[7]\n Even if such a distinction can be plausibly drawn, it may turn out\nthat many or most inequalities in abilities are artificial: as with of\nobsolete skills, those inequalities may be largely attributable to the\nphysical and social environment (Bickenbach 1993).\n",
