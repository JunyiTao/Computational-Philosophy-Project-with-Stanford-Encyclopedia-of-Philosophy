    "main_text": "Psychoanalysis and Utopian Vision || Eros and Logos\n4.3  Eros and Logos\n\n\nChapter Five of Eros and Civilization entitled\n\u201cPhilosophical Interlude\u201d occurs as a bit of a rupture in\nthe text. After discussing the Freudian theory of the instincts\nfor four chapters, Marcuse takes a break from Freud and engages\nphilosophy instead. However, this break is consistent with the\npurpose of the book. One of Marcuse\u2019s main concerns in all\nof his work is the rationalization of domination. This was a\nmajor theme in One-Dimensional Man. This chapter also\ngives us a clue as to why Freud is so important for critical\ntheory. Freud is put in opposition to the entire western\nphilosophical tradition. The problem with the western\nphilosophical tradition is that it constructs a view of rationality\nthat is in compliance with the oppressive function of rationality or\nthe form of rationality that supports domination. For example,\nthe Kantian notion of moral duty for the sake of duty subordinates\nhappiness to duty. Although Kant provides good reasons for this,\nhe does not adequately address the need for happiness. According\nto Kant following, the moral law makes one worthy of happiness perhaps\nin the afterlife, but there is no real concern for happiness in the\npresent world. \n\nMarcuse\u2019s criticism of western philosophy is very similar to\nrecent criticisms by feminists and Africana philosophers. That\nis, philosophy tends to treat human beings as pure, abstract\nconsciousness. The body and the passions are to be subdued by\nreason or Logos. Marcuse does not intend to subjugate\nLogos (reason) to Eros (desire). He simply\nwants to return Eros to its proper place as equal to\nLogos. It is Freud who recognizes the central role of\nEros as a motivating factor in human action. \n",
