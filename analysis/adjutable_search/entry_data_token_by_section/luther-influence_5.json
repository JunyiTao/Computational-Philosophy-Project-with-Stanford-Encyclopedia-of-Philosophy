    "main_text": "Luther, Heidegger, and L\u00f8gstrup\n6. Luther and \u201cModernity\u201d\n\nLeaving aside Luther\u2019s influence on individual philosophers,\nthere has also been some philosophical interest in considering his\nwider cultural and historical impact on \u201cmodernity\u201d, and\nhis role in shaping the modern world as we now understand\nit.[39] Of\ncourse, this is a highly complex matter (for a helpful overview, see\nZachhuber 2017), but broadly five approaches have been adopted. On\nsome accounts (such as Hegel\u2019s outlined above, as well as\nHeine\u2019s) Luther\u2019s impact is seen as both decisive and\npositive, alongside a largely positive conception of modernity itself,\nwhere here the emphasis might lie on his resistance to religious\nauthority, and his prioritising of the conscience of the individual.\nOn other accounts, this impact is accepted, but seen instead as an\nobject of criticism, as the relevant features of modernity are\ndeplored, so that for example Luther is blamed for the rise of modern\nindividualism, of voluntarism, and of the secularism that is said to\ngo along with both (see for example Maritain 1925). A third approach\n(as we also saw above in relation to the Marxist tradition and to\nMarcuse, for example) may also blame Luther for unequivocally\nproblematic aspects of modernity, such as authoritarianism and\nanti-Semitism. A fourth approach is to see Luther as in fact standing\nin contrast to certain key positive features of modern thought, such\nas rationalism, freedom, and religious tolerance; for example, the\njuxtaposition between his views and those of Erasmus\u2019s humanism\nis sometimes portrayed in this light (see for example Gillespie 2008;\nMassing 2018). And of course, if one adopts certain views of the\ndevelopment of Luther\u2019s thought, one may attribute different\ninfluences as coming from different phases, and treat some as more\npositive than others (by distinguishing, for example, between a\n\u201cradical\u201d earlier Luther and a more\n\u201cconservative\u201d later Luther), so that Luther\u2019s\nimpact may be understood as taking more than one (and even\ncontradictory) form (see for example Erdozain 2016). A final approach\nis to criticise all attempts to link Luther too closely with such\ndebates concerning \u201cthe modern\u201d, arguing that this is\nhistorically anachronistic, as he is more essentially a medieval\nfigure, so that to focus myopically on his impact on modernity will be\nto distort our understanding of Luther himself, and also perhaps of\nhis distinctiveness and originality, while also neglecting the way\nLuther\u2019s own thinking changed over time (for a recent example of\nthis approach, see Helmer 2019). This is not the occasion to\nadjudicate such debates, but it is hoped that the account of Luther\ngiven previously will make it possible to give proper consideration to\nsome of the issues they raise. For in discussing how far Luther shaped\nthe modern world, some consideration of how far he shaped philosophy\nsurely deserves a place. \n",
