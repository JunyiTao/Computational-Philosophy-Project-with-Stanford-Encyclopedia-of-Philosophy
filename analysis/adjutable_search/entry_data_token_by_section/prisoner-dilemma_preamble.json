    "main_text": "\n\nTanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia Savings\nBank and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care much more about\ntheir personal freedom than about the welfare of their accomplice. A\nclever prosecutor makes the following offer to each: \u201cYou may\nchoose to confess or remain silent. If you confess and your accomplice\nremains silent I will drop all charges against you and use your\ntestimony to ensure that your accomplice does serious time. Likewise,\nif your accomplice confesses while you remain silent, they will go\nfree while you do the time. If you both confess I get two convictions,\nbut I'll see to it that you both get early parole. If you both remain\nsilent, I'll have to settle for token sentences on firearms possession\ncharges. If you wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailer\nbefore my return tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdilemma\u201d faced by the prisoners here is that,\nwhatever the other does, each is better off confessing than remaining\nsilent. But the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each\nthan the outcome they would have obtained had both remained silent. A\ncommon view is that the puzzle illustrates a conflict between\nindividual and group rationality. A group whose members pursue\nrational self-interest may all end up worse off than a group whose\nmembers act contrary to rational self-interest. More generally, if the\npayoffs are not assumed to represent self-interest, a group whose\nmembers rationally pursue any goals may all meet less success than if\nthey had not rationally pursued their goals individually. A closely\nrelated view is that the prisoner's dilemma game and its multi-player\ngeneralizations model familiar situations in which it is difficult to\nget rational, selfish agents to cooperate for their common good. Much\nof the contemporary literature has focused on identifying conditions\nunder which players would or should make the \u201ccooperative\u201d\nmove corresponding to remaining silent. A slightly different\ninterpretation takes the game to represent a choice between selfish\nbehavior and socially desirable altruism. The move corresponding to\nconfession benefits the actor, no matter what the other does, while\nthe move corresponding to silence benefits the other player no matter\nwhat that other player does. Benefiting oneself is not always wrong,\nof course, and benefiting others at the expense of oneself is not\nalways morally required, but in the prisoner's dilemma game both\nplayers prefer the outcome with the altruistic moves to that with the\nselfish moves. This observation has led David Gauthier and others to\ntake the prisoner's dilemma to say something important about the\nnature of morality.\n\nHere is another story. Bill has a blue cap and would prefer a red one,\nwhile Rose has a red cap and would prefer a blue one. Both prefer two\ncaps to any one and either of the caps to no cap at all. They are each\ngiven a choice between keeping the cap they have or giving it to the\nother. This \u201cexchange game\u201d has the same structure as the\nstory about the prisoners. Whether Rose keeps her cap or gives to\nBill, Bill is better off keeping his and she is better off if he gives\nit to her. Whether Bill keeps his cap or gives it to Rose, Rose is\nbetter off keeping hers and he is better off if she gives it to him.\nBut both are better off if they exchange caps than if they both keep\nwhat they have. The new story suggests that the prisoner's dilemma\nalso occupies a place at the heart of our economic system. It would\nseem that any market designed to facilitate mutually beneficial\nexchanges will need to overcome the dilemma or avoid it. \n\nPuzzles with the structure of the prisoner's dilemma were discussed by\nMerrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950, as part of the Rand\nCorporation's investigations into game theory (which Rand pursued\nbecause of possible applications to global nuclear strategy). The\ntitle \u201cprisoner's dilemma\u201d and the version with prison\nsentences as payoffs are due to Albert Tucker, who wanted to make\nFlood and Dresher's ideas more accessible to an audience of Stanford\npsychologists. More recently, it has been suggested (Peterson, p1)\nthat Tucker may have been discussing the work of his famous graduate\nstudent John Nash, and Nash 1950 (p. 291) does indeed contain a game\nwith the structure of the prisoner's dilemma as the second in a series\nof six examples illustrating his technical ideas. Although Flood and\nDresher (and Nash) didn't themselves rush to publicize their ideas in\nexternal journal articles, the puzzle has since attracted widespread\nand increasing attention in a variety of disciplines. Donninger\nreports that \u201cmore than a thousand articles\u201d about it were\npublished in the sixties and seventies. A Google Scholar\nsearch for \u201cprisoner's dilemma\u201d in 2018 returns 49,600\nresults.\n\nThe sections below provide a variety of more precise characterizations\nof the prisoner's dilemma, beginning with the narrowest, and survey\nsome connections with similar games and some applications in\nphilosophy and elsewhere. Particular attention is paid to iterated and\nevolutionary versions of the game. In the fomer, the prisoner's\ndilemma game is played repeatedly, opening the possibility that a\nplayer can use its current move to reward or punish the other's play\nin previous moves in order to induce cooperative play in the future.\nIn the latter, members of a population play one another repeatedly in\nprisoner's dilemma games and those who get higher payoffs\n\u201creproduce\u201d more rapidly than those who get lower payoffs.\n\u2018Prisoner's dilemma\u2019 is abbreviated as\n\u2018PD\u2019.\n",
