    "main_text": "Further Issues || Constitution and Emergence\n4.2 Constitution and Emergence\n\nAs noted above\n (section 1.1),\n many Russellian monists claim that macrophenomenal properties are\nconstituted by quiddities, or by quiddities and structure.\nBut not all do. Instead, some claim that macrophenomenal properties\nemerge from quiddities, or from quiddities and structure\n(Goff 2015), where emergence is taken to be a (diachronic or\nsynchronic) causal relation.\n\nHowever, some object that the causal-emergence construal undermines\nthe claim that on Russellian monism consciousness is integrated into\nphysical causation (Alter and Nagasawa 2012: 81; Chalmers 2013 [2015:\n253\u2013259]). The objection could be stated as follows. On the\ncausal-emergence construal, there are causal laws connecting\nquiddities (or quiddities and structural properties) to\nmacrophenomenal consciousness: laws that are neither a priori\nentailed nor metaphysically necessitated by the structural truths that\nphysical theory describes. In this respect, such laws would be just\nlike psychophysical laws posited by traditional interactionist\ndualism. And it is precisely because of the need to posit such\npsychophysical laws that traditional interactionist dualism is charged\nwith failing to integrate consciousness adequately into physical\ncausation (Smart 1959). Thus, on the causal-emergence construal, that\ncharge would apply equally to Russellian monism (but see Goff 2015:\n294\u201397; 2017: Part II passim).\n",
