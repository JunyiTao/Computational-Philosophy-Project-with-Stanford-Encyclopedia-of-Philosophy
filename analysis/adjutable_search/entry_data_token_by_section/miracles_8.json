Insofar as the definition of\n\u201cmiracle\u201d in question is one that involves divine agency,\nany argument that demonstrated the non-existence of God would be eo\nipso a demonstration that miracles do not take place; and an\nargument that demonstrated that the existence of God is impossible\nwould demonstrate that miracles are likewise impossible. But the more\ncommon arguments for this conclusion are more modest; rather than\nsetting out to show the existence of God to be impossible, they\ntypically invoke theological premises to show that if there were a God,\nthen miracles would not occur.\n\n\nIn chapter 6 of his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Baruch\nSpinoza sets out to argue for the claim that nature cannot be\ncontravened, but that she \u201cpreserves a fixed and immutable\ncourse,\u201d in consequence of which a miracle is \u201ca sheer\nabsurdity\u201d (Spinoza 1670/1862: 123, 128). His argument for this\nclaim is somewhat difficult to follow, but it appears to run\napproximately like this:\n\nThe will of God is identical with the laws of nature.\nA miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.\nNecessarily, God\u2019s will is inviolable.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nMiracles cannot happen.\n\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s argument is unlikely to persuade anyone who does not\nstart out with his identification of the laws of nature with the will\nof God. From a more traditional theistic standpoint, the argument is\nsimply an elaborate exercise in begging the question.\n\n\nA non-theological version of this argument, sometimes mistakenly\nattributed to Hume, is actually due to Voltaire (1764/1901: 272):\n\n\nA miracle is the violation of mathematical, divine, immutable,\neternal laws. By the very exposition itself, a miracle is a\ncontradiction in terms: a law cannot at the same time be immutable and\nviolated.\n\n\nThe trouble with this crude argument is once again in the definition\nof \u201cmiracle,\u201d which here goes beyond a mere violation\nconcept in adding immutability, which generates the contradiction. One\nretort that historically proved attractive is to accept the violation\nconcept but deny that the laws of nature are immutable; instead the\ntruly immutable laws are higher laws\u2014laws that govern not only\nthe behavior of physical entities but the interactions of physical and\nnon-physical entities\u2014and what appear to us to be violations of\nthe laws of nature are really nothing less than instances of a higher\nlaw (Trench 1847:14\u201317; cf. Venn 1888: 433 ff).\n\n\nA more subtle version of a theological objection can also be found\nin the entry \u201cMiracles\u201d in Voltaire\u2019s\nPhilosophical Dictionary (1764/1901: 273):\n\n\n[I]t is impossible a being infinitely wise can have made laws to\nviolate them. He could not \u2026 derange the machine but with a view\nof making it work better; but it is evident that God, all-wise and\nomnipotent, originally made this immense machine, the universe, as good\nand perfect as He was able; if He saw that some imperfections would\narise from the nature of matter, He provided for that in the beginning;\nand, accordingly, He will never change anything in it.\n\n\nIt is therefore impious to ascribe miracles to God; they would\nindicate a lack of forethought, or of power, or both.\n\n\nThis argument was popular during the deist controversy of the early\nand mid 18th century, and the orthodox response is summed up well by\nPaley (1859: 12): \u201c[I]n what way can a revelation be made but by\nmiracles? In none which we are able to conceive.\u201d Paley\u2019s\npoint is not merely negative; rather, it is that only by setting up a\nuniverse with regularities that no mere human can abrogate and then\nsuspending them could God, if there were a God, authenticate a\nrevelation, stamping it with divine approval by an act of sovereignty.\nIf there is a God who wishes to authenticate a communication to man in\nan unmistakable fashion, then, in Paley\u2019s view, an authenticating\nmiracle is inevitable. It is therefore not at all impious to\nascribe miracles to God, and they imply no limit either on His\nknowledge or on His power; they are both a sign of His approval and\nevidence of His benevolent foresight.\n3.1.2 Arguments that miracle claims could never be rationally believed\n\n\nThe principal argument against the rational credibility of miracle\nclaims derives from Hume. \u201cA miracle,\u201d he writes,\n\n\nis a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable\nexperience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle,\nfrom the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from\nexperience can possibly be imagined. (Hume 1748/2000:\n86\u201387)\n\n\n\n\nHe ends the first Part of his essay \u201cOf Miracles\u201d with a\ngeneral maxim:\n\n\nThe plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our\nattention), \u201cThat no testimony is sufficient to establish a\nmiracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood\nwould be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to\nestablish: And even in that case, there is a mutual destruction of\narguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that\ndegree of force, which remains, after deducting the\ninferior.\u201d\n\n\nThe maxim itself is open to interpretive disputes. George Campbell\n(1762/1839) considers it to be trivial, a judgment with which Earman\n(2000) concurs. One simple way to arrive at it from a Bayesian point of\nview is to take the initial equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(M\\mid E)}{P({\\sim}M\\mid E)} = \n  \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \\frac{P(E\\mid M)}{P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)},\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the proposed evidence for a miracle, and make the\nsimplifying approximation that \\(P(E\\mid M) \\approx P({\\sim}M)\\),\nsince both terms are close to 1. Then the right side reduces to the\nratio of the two remaining \u201csmall\u201d terms, \\(P(M)/P(E\\mid\n{\\sim}M)\\), which will be a fair approximation of the posterior\nodds. Then the posterior probability of M will exceed 0.5 just in case\n\\(P(M) \\gt P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\). This interpretation is endorsed by\nHolder (1998) but challenged by Millican (2002), who also surveys\nvarious other probabilistic interpretations of Hume\u2019s maxim.\n\n\nMillican (2011) argues that many interpreters of Hume have overlooked a critical distinction between a type of testimony and a token of that testimony, where the latter is a particular instance of testimony asserting the occurrence of one particular event. Under the token interpretation, Millican grants, Hume\u2019s maxim would be trivial. But on the former interpretation, all testimony belongs to a type that has a characteristic or typical probability of falsehood. According to Millican, it is that typical probability that Hume has in view when constructing his maxim rather than the particular probability of falsehood of a specific piece of evidence.\n\n\nHume immediately illustrates this maxim by applying it to the case\nof testimony to a resurrection:\n\n\nWhen anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I\nimmediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that\nthis person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact,\nwhich he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle\nagainst the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover,\nI pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the\nfalsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event\nwhich he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my\nbelief or opinion. (Hume 1748/2000: 87\u201388)\n\n\n\n\nIs this an argument, or even an elliptical statement of one premise in\nan argument? And if so, what is its structure? The traditional\ninterpretation has been that it is an argument from the nature of the\ncase, the conclusion being that a miracle story could not be believed\non testimony even under the most favorable circumstances. As far as we\ncan tell, all of Hume\u2019s contemporaries, including John Leland (1755),\nWilliam Adams (1767), Richard Price (1777), and George Campbell\n(1762/1839), read him this way. There is, however, considerable recent\ndisagreement as to whether Hume intended Part 1 of his essay as an\nargument, disagreement that arises in part from the apprehension on\nthe part of some of Hume\u2019s defenders that if it is an argument, it is\nnot very good. The interpretive issues are too extensive to summarize;\nsee Flew (1961), Levine (1989: 152), Johnson (1999), Earman (2000),\nFogelin (2003), McGrew (2005), and H\u00e1jek (2008). But it is\nbeyond contesting that some such argument, widely attributed to Hume,\nhas been tremendously influential.\n\n\nA very simple version of the argument, leaving out the comparison to\nthe laws of nature and focusing on the alleged infirmities of\ntestimony, can be laid out deductively (following Whately, in Paley\n1859: 33):\n\nTestimony is a kind of evidence very likely to be false.\nThe evidence for the Christian miracles is testimony.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe evidence for the Christian miracles is likely to be\nfalse.\n\n\n\nThis is, however, much too crude an argument to carry any weight,\nsince it turns on a simple ambiguity between all testimony and\nsome testimony. Whately offers an amusing parody that makes\nthe fallacy obvious: Some books are mere trash; Hume\u2019s Works are\n[some] books; therefore, etc.\n\n\nAnother crude argument that focuses solely on the improbability of\nmiracle claims (Ehrman 2003: 228\u2013229) may be laid out thus:\n\nA miracle is by definition the most improbable of events; the\nprobability of a miracle is infinitesimally remote.\nAn historian can establish only what probably happened in the\npast.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nAn historian can never establish that a miracle happened.\n\n\n\nWaiving the tendentious definition in premise 1, the supposed\ncontradiction involved in denying the conclusion\u2014\u201cthat the\nmost improbable event is the most probable\u201d (Ehrman 2003:\n229)\u2014is merely verbal, arising from a failure to distinguish\nbetween the probability of a miracle claim considered apart from the\nevidence and the probability of the claim given that evidence.\n\n\nFlew (1966: 146; cf. Bradley 1874/1935) offers a more sophisticated\ncriticism, arguing from the nature of historical inquiry that rational\nbelief in miracles is precluded:\n\n\nThe basic propositions are: first, that the present relics of the\npast cannot be interpreted as historical evidence at all, unless we\npresume that the same fundamental regularities obtained then as still\nobtain today; second, that in trying as best he may to determine what\nactually happened the historian must employ as criteria all his present\nknowledge, or presumed knowledge, of what is probable or improbable,\npossible or impossible; and, third, that, since miracle has to be\ndefined in terms of practical impossibility the application of these\ncriteria inevitably precludes proof of a miracle.\n\n\nThe most obvious rejoinder here is that the believer in miracles\ndoes not generally believe that there are no dependable regularities in\nthe physical world; it is in the nature of a miracle to be an exception\nto the ordinary course of nature. The feared undermining of the\nprinciples of historical inquiry is therefore an illusion generated by\nexaggerating the scale on which the order of nature would be disrupted\nwere a miracle actually to occur.\n\n\nAn alternative reading of Hume, proposed by Dorothy Coleman (1988:\n338\u2013339), is that\n\n\nan event that has no ready natural explanation is not necessarily an\nevent that has no natural cause. To be a miracle, an event must be\ninexplicable not in terms of what appears to us to be the laws of\nnature but in terms of what laws of nature actually are\u2026. [O]ne\nmust ask if it is always more likely, i.e., conformable to experience,\nthat those claiming the event to be a miracle are mistaken rather than\nthat the event is a genuine violation of a law of nature.\nCounterinstances of what are taken to be natural laws are not by\nthemselves evidence establishing that no natural law could possibly\nexplain them: at most they provide grounds for revising our\nformulations of natural laws or seeking an improved understanding of\nthe nature of the phenomena in question. At the very least they provide\ngrounds for suspending judgments about the nature of their cause until\nmore evidence is available. On the other hand, past experience shows\nthat what are at one time considered violations of natural laws are\nfrequently found at some later time not to be so. Proportioning belief\nto evidence, therefore, it is more reasonable to believe that the claim\nthat an event is a miracle is mistaken than it is that the event is a\nviolation of natural law.\n\n\nThere is not much to commend this line of argument as a reading of\nHume; both the casual attitude toward our identification of the laws of\nnature and the willingness to grant the occurrence of the event jar\nwith Hume\u2019s own presentation of his view. As Hajek (2008: 86\u201387)\nstresses, Hume is unambiguously arguing that we should\ndisbelieve testimony to an event\u2019s occurrence, when that\nevent really would be miraculous.\n\n\nAs an independent objection to belief in reported miracles,\nColeman\u2019s argument has limited force. On a ceteris\nparibus conception of natural laws, apparent counterevidence to a\nputative law may, depending on circumstances, reduce the probability of\nthe law only slightly, the majority of the impact of the evidence going\nto raise the probability that all else is not, in the present case,\nequal. There is no general principle that would license the conclusion\nthat it is more reasonable to accept the falsehood of the putative law\nthan to suppose the causal closure of nature to be violated. Everything\ndepends on the details of specific cases.\n\n\nA more faithful representation of Hume\u2019s reasoning brings back\nin the comparison between \u201ctwo opposite experiences,\u201d\nreconstructing his argument along these lines:\n\nThe argument against a miracle,\nfrom the nature of the case, is as strong as any argument from\nexperience could possibly be.\nThe argument for a miracle, from\ntestimony, is at best a strong but somewhat weaker argument from\nexperience.\nIn any case where two arguments\nfrom experience point to contradictory conclusions, the stronger\nargument must prevail.\nA conclusion is credible only if\nthe argument supporting it is not overcome by a stronger argument for a\ncontradictory conclusion.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe argument for a miracle, from\ntestimony, cannot even under the most favorable circumstances render\nbelief in a miracle credible.\n\n\n\nHume\u2019s early critics objected vigorously to the claims\nembodied in the first two premises. Price (1777: 402; cf. Adams 1767:\n10\u201311 and Paley 1859: 13\u201314) retorts against the claim in premise 1\nthat \u201ca miracle is more properly an event different from\nexperience than contrary to it.\u201d The presumptive case against the\nresurrection from universal testimony would be as strong as Hume\nsupposes only if, per impossible, all mankind throughout all\nages had been watching the tomb of Jesus on the morning of the third\nday and testified that nothing occurred. Even aside from the problems\nof time travel, there is not a single piece of direct\ntestimonial evidence to Jesus\u2019 non-resurrection. Premise 1 is\ntherefore a wild overstatement.\n\n\nAdams (1767: 37) mounts an attack on premise 2 by drawing attention\nto the manner in which the lives of the apostles corroborate their\ntestimony:\n\n\nThat men should love falshood rather than truth\u2014that they\nshould chuse labour and travail, shame and misery, before pleasure,\nease, and esteem\u2014is as much a violation of the laws of nature, as\nit is for lead or iron to hang unsupported in the air, or for the voice\nof a man to raise the dead to life: but this, I have granted to the\nauthor, is, not miraculous, but impossible, and shall therefore have\nhis leave, I hope, to assert, that falshood, thus attested, is\nimpossible\u2014in other words, that testimony, thus tried and proved,\nis infallible and certain.\n\n\nAnd he drives home the point by a quotation from Hume himself:\n\n\nWe cannot make use of a more convincing argument, than to prove that\nthe actions ascribed to any person are directly contrary to the course\nof nature, and that no human motives, in such circumstances, could\never induce him to such a conduct. (Adams 1767: 48, quoting Hume\n1748/2000: 65)\n\n\n\n\nThis argument, of course, proves at best only the sincerity of the\nwitnesses. But in the present case, he goes on to argue, the nature of\nthe facts attested precludes the possibility that the witnesses are\nthemselves deceived (Adams 1767:37\u201338; cf. Jenkin 1708: 488\u201393).\n\n\nAlan H\u00e1jek (2008: 88) offers a more detailed reconstruction\nof this argument. The first stage corresponds to the argument in\n\u201cOf Miracles,\u201d Part I:\n\nA miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.\nA law of nature is, inter alia, a regularity to which no\nexception has previously been experienced.\n\nThus,\n\nThere is as compelling a \u2018proof\u2019 from experience as\ncan possibly be imagined against a miracle.\nIn particular, the proof from experience in favour of testimony\nof any kind cannot be more compelling.\nThere is no other form of proof in favour of testimony.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe falsehood of the testimony to a miraculous event is always at\nleast as probable as the event attested to (however good the testimony\nseems to be).\n\nHowever,\n\nHume\u2019s balancing principle. The testimony should\nbe believed if, and only if, the falsehood of the testimony is less\nprobable than the event attested to.\n\n\n\nTherefore, (by 7 and 8):\n\nConclusion 1. Testimony to a miraculous event should never be\nbelieved\u2014belief in a miracle report could never be justified.\n\n\n\nH\u00e1jek makes a strong case that this is a faithful\nreconstruction of Hume\u2019s reasoning. But as he goes on to point\nout, this argument is problematic at multiple points. The definition in\n1 is at the least not forced upon us; and the inference from 1 and 2 to\n3 overlooks the possibility that a regularity to which no\nexception has previously been experienced is also a\nregularity of which no instance has previously been\nexperienced\u2014a possibility that is countenanced on some major\nconceptions of laws\u2014or that the law in question has not been\ninstanced very often (H\u00e1jek 2008: 91). Hume might reply that,\nwhile this is theoretically possible, it does not hold in the cases of\ninterest. But even granting that reply, H\u00e1jek points out that 5\nmay be questioned; and 6 is deeply problematic, since lack of analogy\nis at best an obscure reason for concluding that an event is maximally\nimprobable. For if strength of analogy is a critical determinant in a\nrational agent\u2019s probability function, then he should be comparably\nskeptical regarding all spectacular scientific\ndiscoveries\u2014\u201cAnd that is absurd\u201d (H\u00e1jek\n2008: 103).\n\n\nLarmer (2013) surveys a wide range of in-principle objections to justified belief in miracle claims in general and argues that all of them fail to deliver the promised conclusion.\n",
