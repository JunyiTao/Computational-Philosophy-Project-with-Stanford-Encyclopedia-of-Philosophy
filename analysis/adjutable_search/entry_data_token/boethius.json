Life and Works\n\nAnicius Severinus Manlius Boethius was born into the Roman aristocracy\nc. 475\u20137 C.E.\u2014about the same time as the last Roman\nEmperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed (August 476). Boethius lived\nmost of his life under the rule of Theoderic, an Ostrogoth educated at\nConstantinople, who was happy to let the old families keep up their\ntraditions in Rome, while he wielded power in Ravenna.\nBoethius\u2019s privileged social position ensured that he was taught\nGreek thoroughly and, though it is unlikely that he travelled to\nAthens or Alexandria, the sites of the two remaining (Platonic)\nphilosophical schools, he was certainly acquainted with a good deal of\nthe work which had been going on there. He was able to spend most of\nhis life in learned leisure, pursuing his vast project of translating\nand commenting philosophical texts. The Roman aristocracy was, by his\nday, thoroughly Christianized, and Boethius also became involved in\nsome of the ecclesiastical disputes of his time, centring mainly\naround a schism between the Latin and the Greek Churches which was\nresolved shortly before his death.\n\nBoethius\u2019s final years are well known to anyone who has read his\nmost popular work, the Consolation of Philosophy. He agreed\nto become Theoderic\u2019s \u2018Master of Offices\u2019, one of\nthe most senior officials, but he quickly fell out with many others at\ncourt, probably because he attacked their corruption. Accused of\ntreason and of engaging in magic, he was imprisoned and (probably in\n526) executed, but not before he had the chance to write his literary\nmasterpiece.\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy, a prosimetrum (a prose work\nwith verse interludes) which recounts, in polished literary language,\nan imagined dialogue between the prisoner Boethius and a lady who\npersonifies Philosophy, contrasts with the rest of Boethius\u2019s\noeuvre. Besides writing text-books on arithmetic and\ngeometry, closely based on Greek models, Boethius devoted himself to\ntranslating Aristotle\u2019s logic and commenting on it; he produced\na commentary on the Categories and two each on On\nInterpretation and on the Isagoge\n(\u2018Introduction\u2019) by Porphyry, which had become a standard\npart of the logical curriculum. He also composed logical text-books on\ndivision, categorical syllogisms, and on two branches of logic which\nwill require further explanation (see below,\n Section 3):\n hypothetical syllogisms and topical reasoning (along with a\ncommentary on Cicero\u2019s Topics). In three of his four\nTheological Treatises (often known as the Opuscula\nsacra), I, II and V, Boethius uses his logical equipment to\ntackle problems of Christian doctrine; IV, however, is a\nstraightforward statement of Christian doctrine, a sort of confession\nof faith; whilst III is a brief, not specifically Christian\nphilosophical treatise.\n2. The Logical Project and the Logical Commentaries\n\nBoethius\u2019s work as a translator and commentator of Aristotelian\nlogic might appear to be just the beginning of a wider project,\nannounced in the second commentary on On Interpretation (c.\n516), and cut short by his execution, to translate and comment on all\nthe writings of Plato and Aristotle. Yet Boethius seems to have become\nso engrossed in his role as an expositor of logic, not limiting\nhimself to a single commentary on each work, and writing extra\ntextbooks, that it is hard not to see it as having diverted him, in\nany case, from his more grandiose scheme. Indeed, Boethius seems to\nhave pursued a rather special logical project.\n\nThe particular, deliberate nature of this project is not cast into\ndoubt by the fact that Boethius\u2019s logical commentaries, although\nalmost certainly not merely servile translations of marginalia from a\nGreek manuscript (as James Shiel (1990) has argued), are not at all\noriginal in their logical doctrines. For what is important is\nBoethius\u2019s choice of Porphyry as his main authority in logic. It\nwas Porphyry who, two centuries or so earlier, had been responsible\nfor making Aristotelian logic an important subject within the\nNeoplatonic curriculum. He held that it did not conflict with Platonic\ndoctrine, as his teacher Plotinus had believed, because its area of\napplication was limited to the sensible world, to which everyday\nlanguage refers. Later Neoplatonists accepted the importance of\nAristotelian logic, and the harmony between Platonic and Aristotelian\nteaching, but they tended to try and discover Neoplatonic doctrines\neven in the Aristotelian logical texts. In the case of the\nCategories, they even imagined that Aristotle had taken his\ndoctrine from a Pythagorean writer, Archytas, and that there was an\nunderlying and wildly metaphysical strand to the text which it was the\ncommentator\u2019s duty to uncover. Boethius, however, although\nmaking occasional use of later commentaries, usually followed\nPorphyry: on the Categories he stayed close to\nPorphyry\u2019s surviving (and quite simple) question-and-answer\ncommentary, whilst the long, second commentary on On\nInterpretation is commonly accepted as the best guide to\nPorphyry\u2019s exegesis, since his own commentary does not survive.\nBoethius\u2019s commentaries were, therefore, because more\nPorphyrian, so more Aristotelian than what was being written in Greek\nin his period.\n\nBoethius\u2019s Porphyrian approach is evident even in the two\ncommentaries on Porphyry\u2019s own Isagoge (an introduction\nto the Categories which had become accepted as a standard\npart of the logical curriculum)\u2014one text on which, obviously,\nPorphyry himself had never commented. Near the beginning of the\nIsagoge, Porphyry mentions three questions about universals,\nbut declines to discuss them in an introductory work. Do they exist or\nare they mere concepts? If they exist are they bodily or not, and, if\nthey are not, are they separated from sensible things or do they exist\nin them? By Boethius\u2019s time, the Greek commentators had\ndeveloped a standard way of glossing this passage. They explained that\nuniversals could be considered as concepts (universals post\nrem\u2014\u2018following the thing\u2019), as intrinsic to\nbodily things (universals in re\u2014\u2018in the\nthing\u2019) and as really existing and separate from bodies\n(universals ante rem\u2014\u2018before the thing\u2019).\nIn most of his work, Boethius follows this way of thinking about\nuniversals (cf. Cross 2012). But here he takes a different approach,\nturning to a train of thought (1906, 161:14 ff.) which goes back in\npart to Porphyry himself and, through him, to the great Aristotelian,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias.\n\nBoethius begins with an argument against universals as an object of\nenquiry. Everything that really exists is one in number, but nothing\nthat is common to many at the same time can be one in number. But\nuniversals are common to many at the same time. And so\nuniversals do not exist in reality, but in thought alone. Thoughts,\nBoethius continues, are of two sorts: those which derive from their\nobject in the way it is (call them \u2018corresponding\nthoughts\u2019) and those which do not. If the thoughts that are\nuniversals were corresponding thoughts, then universals would also\nexist in reality. Since they do not, universals are non-corresponding\nthoughts, and non-corresponding thoughts are empty. Enquiry into\nuniversals (and therefore into the five predicables studied in the\nIsagoge) should therefore be abandoned. Boethius\u2019s way\nof tackling this objection is to challenge just the very final stage.\nNon-corresponding thoughts, he argues, are not empty if they are\nabstractions. Consider a mathematical object such as a line or a\npoint, which the mathematician contemplates by abstracting from the\nmaterial body of which it is part. No such thing exists in reality as\nan immaterial line or point, and yet the mathematician\u2019s thought\nis not empty or misleading. The case is similar if we disregard the\naccidental features of some particular thing (John Marenbon, for\ninstance) and are left just with his nature of man. This line of\nreply, as Alain de Libera (1999, 159\u2013280) has shown, goes back\nto Alexander of Aphrodisias or his followers. Boethius, however, goes\non to give it his own particular twist, by suggesting that the\nuniversals produced by abstraction are not merely the constructions of\nthe mind, but do grasp reality as it is. Although this line fits oddly\nwith the argument from which Boethius set out, he may already be\nanticipating the Principle of Modes of Cognition, which he proposes in\nthe Consolation (see\n Section 6\n below).\n\nThe long, second commentary on On Interpretation is very\nprobably based, as explained above, on Porphyry\u2019s lost\ncommentary. It thus provides a full account of Porphyry\u2019s\nsemantics\u2014a semantics based on Aristotle, because he takes\nordinary language to be concerned with material things rather than\nwith the intelligible world. There is also an extended discussion of\nthe sea-battle passage in Chapter 9. According to the principle of\nbivalence, \u2018There will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u2019 is either\ntrue or false. But, if it is true, then there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow; if false, there will not be one. Either\nway, is it not therefore a matter of necessity? Boethius\u2019s\nstrategy is to say that \u2018There will be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u2019 is indeed either true or false, but, because the\nsea-battle is a contingent event, its truth or falsehood is only\nindefinite. What does this position amount to? There are various\ninterpretations of how it should be understood. Perhaps the most\nplausible is that Boethius holds that, if an event e is\ncontingent, then the sentence \u2018e will take place\u2019\nis false, even if it turns out that e does in fact happen,\nbecause \u2018e will take place\u2019 implies that\ne will take place necessarily. But a qualified sentence such\nas \u2018e will take place contingently\u2019 is true just\nin case it is not necessary that e happens, and e\nactually happens.\n3. The Logical Text-Books\n\nThe two most interesting of Boethius\u2019s logical text-books are\nthe treatises on topical differentiae (c. 522\u20133) and on\nhypothetical syllogisms (516\u201322), since each gives an insight\ninto an area of late ancient logic for which there are otherwise few,\nif any, sources.\n\nFrom Aristotle\u2019s Topics, logicians of late antiquity\nhad elaborated a system of topical argument, which had been\nconsiderably influenced by the needs of Roman lawyers. The focus of\ntopical theory is on discovering arguments, and these\narguments are not usually formally valid, but merely plausible. The\ntopical differentiae are the classifications of types of such\narguments; knowing the differentiae gives the arguer a ready\nmeans to hit upon a persuasive line of reasoning. Suppose, for\nexample, I want to argue that we should praise Cicero. I start trying\nto think what information I have which might help me to argue this\npoint, and I remember that everyone is full of praises for another\norator, Demosthenes. Then I turn over in my mind the list of topical\ndifferentiae and I see that the differentia\n\u2018from equals\u2019 will provide me with the argument I\nneed:\n\nEveryone praises Demosthenes as an orator.\nCicero is Demosthenes\u2019s equal as an orator.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nEveryone should praise Cicero.\n\n\nAssociated with this, as with every differentia, is a\n\u2018maximal sentence\u2019 (maxima propositio), in this\ncase: \u2018equal things are to be judged equally.\u2019 The maximal\nsentence can be taken as an indication of how to put together the\nargument; it might also be added to the argument in order to make it\nformally valid, but Boethius did not envisage maximal sentences being\nused in this way. Rather, the topical arguer produces arguments of\ndiffering strength, depending on how close to being a logical truth is\nthe maximal sentence associated with the differentia he is\nusing. Some maximal sentences do indeed state fundamental laws of\nreasoning (including modus ponens and modus\ntollens); others state what are at best rules of thumb and, in\nthe case of the topic \u2018from authority\u2019\u2014the\ninjunction to accept as true what the wise, or experts or the majority\nbelieve\u2014not even that.\n\nBoethius\u2019s two main authorities, Cicero and Themistius, give\nrather different lists of the topical differentiae, and one\nof the tasks of his text-book is to show that their schemes do really\ncoincide. In his commentary on Cicero\u2019s Topics, written\nshortly before, Boethius expounds the same theory, but leaves himself\nplenty of room for digressions on such subjects as universals,\ncausation, free will and Stoic logic.\n\nIt is Stoic logic and Boethius\u2019s relations to it which give his\ntreatise On hypothetical syllogisms its special interest. A\nsyllogism is \u2018hypothetical\u2019 when one of its premisses is a\nmolecular sentence which uses \u2018if\u2019 or \u2018or\u2019\n(understood as exclusive disjunction) as a connective. So, for\nexample, the following syllogism is hypothetical:\n\nIf it is day, it is light.\nIt is not light.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is not day.\n\n\nA modern reader will be inclined to see (4\u20136) as a piece of\nsimple sentence logic: p\u2192q; \u00acq; therefore\n\u00acp. Since it was the Stoics who, in antiquity, developed\na sentence logic, by contrast with Aristotle\u2019s term logic, it\nwould appear that Boethius\u2019s treatise on hypothetical syllogisms\nis the tributary of Stoic logic. This conclusion is true to the extent\nthat the tradition Boethius inherited goes back in part to Stoic\nroots. By the time it had reached Boethius, however, Stoic and\nPeripatetic elements had become hopelessly confused (cf. Speca 2001).\nAs C.J. Martin (1991) has shown, Boethius himself lacked the\nconceptual apparatus to think in terms of sentence logic. For him,\n(4\u20136) is to be understood as term logic, in which the predicates\n\u2018is light\u2019 and \u2018is day\u2019 are attributed to or\ndenied of a vague subject \u2018it\u2019. The treatise itself is\nmainly devoted to a laborious calculation of the various different\npossible forms of hypothetical syllogism involving two, three (with a\nfirst premise such as \u2018If it is A, then if it is\nB, it is C\u2019) and four terms (with a first\npremise such as \u2018If, if it is A then it is B,\nthen, if it is C then it is D\u2019).\n4. The Theological Treatises\n\nThe three opuscula sacra written to analyse points of\nChristian doctrine seem to have been occasioned by events of the time.\nTreatise V, against Eutyches and Nestorius, was apparently inspired by\na letter (c. 513) from a group of Greek bishops, proposing a\nChristological formula which, they hoped, would unite the Western and\nEastern Churches. The two treatises on the Trinity (II is a partial\nsketch for I) are probably related to the intervention in 519 by a\ngroup of Scythian monks, also designed to heal the schism. The works\nhave, however, an interest far beyond their contributions to the\nimmediate doctrinal debate. They pioneer a method of using logical\nanalysis in a theological context which Augustine had anticipated but\nnot developed. Both heretical positions (for examples, the views about\nChrist and human nature held by Eutyches and Nestorius) and orthodox\nChristian doctrine are subjected to rigorous scrutiny, using the\ntechniques of Aristotelian logic and, where necessary, ideas from\nAristotelian physics. The heretical ideas are shown to contain logical\ncontradictions. As for the orthodox understanding of God, it does not\nfit within the classifications of Aristotelian logic and natural\nscience, but Boethius tries to chart exactly how far these\ndistinctions, which are accommodated to the created world, also apply\nto the deity, and at what point they break down and provide us merely\nwith an analogy.\n\nThis way of thinking about God is made especially clear in the longer\ntreatise on the Trinity (I). When God is said to have an attribute,\nhow is this predication to be understood? For created things, on the\nAristotelian scheme, a predication is either substantial (when the\ngenus, species or differentia is predicated of something:\n\u2018Socrates is an animal/man/rational\u2019) or accidental, when\nthe predicate is any accident in any of the nine Aristotelian\ncategories of accident. Augustine had already acknowledged that\nnothing is predicated of God accidentally. Predications about him may\nbe relative, as when he is called \u2018Father\u2019 or\n\u2018Son\u2019, or substantial. Even when a quality or quantity is\nattributed to him, the predication is substantial. When we say of a\ncreated thing that it is great or good, we are affirming that it\nparticipates in greatness or goodness: it is one thing for the thing\nto exist, another for it to be great or good. But God is greatness\nitself and goodness itself, and so, when we say, \u2018God is\ngood\u2019 or \u2018God is great\u2019, we are not affirming any\nattribute of him beyond what he is as a substance. This Augustinian\nview is faithfully set out in the brief Treatise II.\n\nIn Treatise I, Boethius develops this scheme. In especial, he\ndistinguishes between predications in the categories of Substance,\nQuantity and Quality, which are proper and intrinsic, and those in the\nother six categories, excluding Relation, which he calls improper and\nextrinsic. The intuitive idea behind the distinction seems to be that\npredications in these other categories concern only how the subject\nrelates to other things; only substantial, quantitative and\nqualitative attributes characterize the thing itself. Boethius goes on\nto say that, whereas all proper, intrinsic predications about God are\nsubstantial, extrinsic, improper predications about him are not: they\ndo not concern what either God or his creatures are, but are\nrather about exterior things.\n\nThe discussion of Relation shows particularly clearly how Boethius\napplies logic to analysing God as far as he can, and then shows where\nand how the logic fails. He needs to explain how it can be true that\nthe same, one God is both the Father and the Son. He does so by\nclaiming that a predication of Relation, such as \u2018is the\nFather\u2019, does not concern the substance of the things related:\nthat a is related to b in no way changes a\nor b. Moreover, there are some relationships which a thing\ncan have to itself\u2014for example, that of equality. Being-a-father\nand being-a-son are not, among created things, such relations: no one\ncan be his own father or his own son. But it is here, says Boethius,\nthat creaturely logic breaks down when it tries to comprehend the\nTrinity: we have in some way to try to grasp the idea of a relation of\nfatherhood or filiation which is reflexive.\n\nAnother philosophical question Boethius explores in his discussions of\nthe Trinity is individuation (as well as more widely the topic of\nparts and wholes). Unfortunately, it is not completely clear to what\ntheory of individuation he subscribes. A quick reading of some\npassages would suggest that substances are indviduated by a bundle of\naccidents, but there are indications that Boethius may have preferred\na theory of individuation by spatio-temporal position, or one\ndifferent from either of these (cf. Arlig, 2009).\n\nTreatise III is also concerned with predication and God. But it\ndiffers sharply from the other treatises, in that it contains nothing\nspecifically Christian. The question it addresses is how all\nsubstances are good in that they are, and yet are not substantial\ngoods. Boethius takes it as a fundamental truth that all things tend\nto the good, and also that things are by nature like what they desire.\nEverything, therefore, is by nature good. But if so, then things must\nbe good either by participation, or substantially (or\n\u2018essentially\u2019 as a modern philosopher would say). If they\nwere merely good by participation, they would be good by accident, not\nby nature. But if they are good substantially, then their substance is\ngoodness itself, and so nothing can be distinguished from the first\ngood, God. In giving his answer, Boethius makes use of a set of axioms\nhe states at the beginning of the piece, and undertakes a\nthought-experiment in which it is supposed per impossibile\nthat God does not exist. The key to his solution lies in finding a\nprincipled way to distinguish between a thing a being\nF in that it exists, and a thing a being\nsubstantially F. For a to be substantially\nF means, Boethius\u2019s discussion implies, that\n\u2018a is not-F\u2019 is inconceivable (we might\nsay \u2018logically impossible\u2019). For a to be\nF in that it exists means just that \u2018a is\nnot-F\u2019 is impossible (we might say \u2018impossible\ngiven the way the world is set up\u2019). Whereas it is inconceivable\nthat God is not good, it is merely impossible that everything is not\ngood.\n5. The Consolation of Philosophy: The Argument of Books I\u2013V.2\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy presents interpretative\ndifficulties of a different order from the logical works or the\ntheological treatises. Unlike them, it is written in an elaborate\nliterary form: it consists of a dialogue between Boethius, sitting in\nhis prison-cell awaiting execution, and a lady who personifies\nPhilosophy, and its often highly rhetorical prose is interspersed with\nverse passages. Moreover, although it is true that elsewhere Boethius\ndoes not write in a way which identifies him as a Christian except in\nthe Theological Treatises I, II, IV and V, the absence of any explicit\nreference to Christianity in the Consolation poses a special\nproblem, when it is recalled that it is the work of a man about to\nface death and so very literally composing his philosophical and\nliterary testament. These questions will appear in sharper focus\n (Section 7)\n when the argument of the Consolation has been examined.\n\nBoethius\u2019s real predicament sets the scene for the argument of\nthe Consolation. He represents himself as utterly confused\nand dejected by his sudden change of fortune. Philosophy\u2019s first\njob\u2014true to the generic aim of a consolatio\u2014is to\nconsole, not by offering sympathy, but by showing that Boethius has no\ngood reason to complain: true happiness, she wishes to argue, is not\ndamaged even by the sort of disaster he has experienced. She also\nidentifies in Book I a wider objective: to show that it is not the\ncase, as Boethius the character claims, that the wicked prosper and\nthe good are oppressed.\n\nPhilosophy seems to have two different lines of argument to show\nBoethius that his predicament does not exclude him from true\nhappiness. The first train of argument rests on a complex\nview of the highest good. The first (which is put forward in Book II\nand the first part of Book III) distinguishes between the ornamental\ngoods of fortune, which are of very limited value\u2014riches,\nstatus, power and sensual pleasure\u2014and the true goods: the\nvirtues and also sufficiency, which is what those who seek riches,\nstatus and power really desire. It also recognizes some non-ornamental\ngoods of fortune, such as a person\u2019s friends and family, as\nhaving considerable genuine value. On the basis of these distinctions,\nPhilosophy can argue that Boethius has not lost any true goods, and\nthat he still even retains those goods of fortune\u2014his\nfamily\u2014which carry much real worth. She does not maintain that,\nin his fall from being powerful, rich and respected to the status of a\ncondemned prisoner, Boethius has lost nothing of any worth at all. But\nhis loss need not cut him off from true happiness, which is attained\nprimarily by an austere life based on sufficiency, virtue and\nwisdom.\n\nPhilosophy\u2019s second line of argument is based on a\nsimple view of the highest good. She begins to put it forward\nin III.10, a turning-point in the discussion, which is preceded by the\nmost solemn poem of the whole work (III m. 9), an invocation to God in\nterms borrowed from Plato\u2019s Timaeus. Through a number\nof arguments which draw out the consequences of the Neoplatonic\nassumptions which Boethius accepts, Philosophy shows that the perfect\ngood and perfect happiness are not merely in God: they are\nGod. Perfect happiness is therefore completely untouched by changes in\nearthly fortune, however drastic. But what this second approach fails\nto explain is how the individual human, such as Boethius, is supposed\nto relate to the perfect happiness which is God. Philosophy seems to\nspeak as if, merely by knowing that God is perfect happiness,\nBoethius himself will be rendered happy, although in the next section\nit seems that it is by acting well that a person can attain the\ngood.\n\nPhilosophy now goes on (III.11\u201312) to explain how God rules the\nuniverse. He does so by acting as a final cause. He is the good which\nall things desire, and so he functions as \u2018a helm and rudder, by\nwhich the fabric of the world is kept stable and without decay.\u2019\nPhilosophy thus pictures an entirely non-interventionist God,\npresiding over a universe which is well-ordered simply because he\nexists. But how does this account fit with the apparent oppression of\nthe good and triumph of the wicked, about which Boethius had begun by\ncomplaining? In Book IV.1\u20134, Philosophy shows, drawing on\nPlato\u2019s Gorgias, that the evil do not really prosper\nand they are in fact powerless. Her central argument is that what\neveryone wants is happiness, and happiness is identical with the good.\nThe good have therefore gained happiness, whereas the wicked have not;\nand since people have power in so far as they can gain or bring about\nwhat they want, the wicked are powerless. She also argues that the\ngood gain their reward automatically, since by being good, they attain\nthe good, which is happiness. By contrast, since evil is not a thing\nbut a privation of existence, by being wicked people punish\nthemselves, because they cease even to exist\u2014that is to say,\nthey stop being the sort of things they were, humans, and become\nother, lower animals. Philosophy is therefore able to put forward\nemphatically two of the most counter-intuitive claims of the\nGorgias: that the wicked are happier when they are prevented\nfrom their evil and punished for it, than when they carry it out with\nimpunity, and that those who do injustice are unhappier than those who\nsuffer it.\n\nAt the beginning of IV.5, however, there is another change of\ndirection. Boethius the character is allowed to put forward the\nobvious, common-sense objections to the position Philosophy has been\ntaking: \u2018which wise man\u2019, he asks, \u2018would prefer to\nbe a penniless, disgraced exile rather than stay in his own city and\nlead there a flourishing life, mighty in wealth, revered in honour and\nstrong in power?\u2019 Philosophy answers by abandoning completely\nthe explanation developed from III.11 onwards, which presented God as\na non-intervening final cause, and offers instead a view of God as the\nefficient cause of all things. Divine providence is the unified view\nin God\u2019s mind of the course of events which, unfolded in time,\nis called \u2018fate\u2019, and everything which takes place on\nearth is part of God\u2019s providence. Philosophy\u2019s change of\ndirection might seem at first to make Boethius\u2019s common-sense\nobjection even harder to answer, but in fact it is easy enough for her\nto explain that apparently unjust rewards and punishments on earth\nalways serve a good, though to us hidden, purpose: for instance,\nexercising good people to increase their virtue, helping the wicked to\nrepent or, alternatively, letting them bring themselves to ruin. A\nless tractable problem raised by Philosophy\u2019s new approach is\nthat it seems to imply that the human will is causally determined.\nUnlike many modern philosophers, Boethius did not believe that the\nwill can remain free, in the sense needed for attribution of moral\nresponsibility, if it is determined causally. Moreover, Philosophy\ninsists that the causal chain of providence, as worked out in fate,\nembraces all that happens. In V.1, when Boethius asks about chance,\nPhilosophy explains that events are said to happen by chance when they\nare the result of a chain of causes which is unintended or unexpected,\nas when someone is digging in a field for vegetables and finds a\nburied treasure. Philosophy\u2019s solution is to argue (V.2) that\nrational acts of volition, unlike all external events, do not\nthemselves belong to the causal chain of fate. This freedom, however,\nis enjoyed only by \u2018the divine and supernal substances\u2019\nand by human beings engaged in the contemplation of God. It is reduced\nand lost as humans give their attentions to worldly things and allow\nthemselves to be swayed by the passions.\n6. Divine Prescience, Contingency and Eternity\n\nIn V.3, however, the character Boethius puts forward an argument,\nbased on God\u2019s foreknowledge of future events, which threatens\nto show that even mental acts of willing are necessary and so (as\nBoethius the author believed) unfree. He argues that:\n\n[7] If God foresees all things and cannot be mistaken in any way, what\nprovidence has foreseen will be, will necessarily happen. [8] So, if\nGod foreknows from eternity not just what humans will do but also\ntheir plans and volitions, there will be no freedom of choice, for\nthere will not be able to be any deed, or any sort of volition that\ninfallible divine providence has not foreseen. For if volitions are\ncapable of turning out differently from how they have been foreseen,\nthen there will not be firm foreknowlede of the future, but rather\nuncertain opinion, and I judge it wicked to believe that about God.\n\n\nSince it is accepted that God is omniscient, and that this implies\nthat he knows what every future event\u2014including mental\nevents such as volitions\u2014will be, (7) and (8) each seem to rule\nout any sort of freedom of the will requisite for attributing moral\nresponsibility: a consequence the disastrous implications of which\nBoethius the character vividly describes.\n\nPhilosophy\u2019s answer to this difficulty is the most\nphilosophically intricate and interesting section of the\nConsolation. It is one part of Boethius\u2019s work (perhaps\nthe only one) which remains of interest in contemporary philosophy (of\nreligion) and, for that reason, it has often been interpreted\naccording to a framework provided by more recent thinking about the\nproblem of divine prescience (see, for example, Leftow 1991, Zagzebski\n1991). The following is, rather, an attempt to present the discussion\nas it actually proceeds in the Consolation.\n\nThe first point which needs to be settled is what, precisely, is the\nproblem which Boethius the character proposes? One way of reading this\ndiscussion is that the argument here is in fact fallacious. According\nto this interpretation, the reasoning behind (7) seems to be of the\nfollowing form:\n\nGod knows every event, including all future ones.\nWhen someone knows that an event will happen, then the\nevent will happen.\n(10) is true as a matter of necessity, because it is impossible to\nknow that which is not the case.\nIf someone knows an event will happen, it will happen necessarily.\n(10, 11)\nEvery event, including future ones, happens necessarily. (9,\n12)\n\n\nThe pattern behind (8) will be similar, but in reverse: from a\nnegation of (13), the negation of (9) will be seen to follow. But, as\nit is easy to observe, (9\u201313) is a fallacious argument: (10) and\n(11) imply, not (12), but\n\nNecessarily, if someone knows an event will happen, it will\nhappen.\n\n\nThe fallacy in question concerns the scope of the necessity operator.\nBoethius, the claim would be, has mistakenly inferred the\n(narrow-scope) necessity of the consequent (\u2018the event will\nhappen\u2019), when he is entitled only to infer the (wide-scope)\nnecessity of the whole conditional (\u2018if someone knows an event\nwill happen, it will happen\u2019). Boethius the character is clearly\ntaken in by this fallacious argument, and there is no good reason to\nthink that Boethius the author ever became aware of the fallacy\n(despite a passage later on which some modern commentators have\ninterpreted in this sense). None the less, the discussion which\nfollows does not, as the danger seems to be, address itself to a\nnon-problem. Intuitively, Boethius sees that the threat which divine\nprescience poses to the contingency of future events arises not just\nfrom the claim that God\u2019s beliefs about the future constitute\nknowledge, but also from the fact that they are beliefs about\nthe future. There is a real problem here, because if God\nknows now what I shall do tomorrow, then it seems that either what I\nshall do is already determined, or else that I shall have the power\ntomorrow to convert God\u2019s knowledge today into a false belief.\nAlthough his logical formulation does not capture this problem, the\nsolution Boethius gives to Philosophy is clearly designed to tackle\nit.\n\nIt is also possible to read the way that the question is posed by\nBoethius the character as not involving a fallacy (Marenbon 2013).\nBoethius the character is, on this reading, putting forward a sort of\ntranscendental argument. Boethius considers that when a knower knows a\nfuture event, as opposed to merely having opinion about it, the knower\nis judging that the event is fixed, since if it were an event that\ncould be otherwise, it could be the object of opinion but not\nknowledge. If future events could be otherwise, then God, in knowing\nthem, would in fact be holding a false belief, since he would be\njudging that they could not be otherwise. But God has no false\nbeliefs, and so the world must be such that his beliefs about future\nevents are not false, and so all future events must be fixed.\n\nPhilosophy identifies (V.4) the character Boethius\u2019s central\ndifficulty as lying in the apparent incompatibility between an\nevent\u2019s not having a necessary outcome and yet its being\nforeknown. To foresee something \u2018as if it were certain\u2019\nwhen it is uncertain how it will turn out is \u2018foreign to the\nintegrity of knowledge\u2019, since it involves \u2018judging a\nthing as being other than it is.\u2019 Philosophy counters these\ndoubts with the principle that \u2018everything that is known is\ngrasped, not according to its own power, but rather according to the\ncapacity of those who know it.\u2019 Her view, as she develops it (in\nV.5 and V.6), is based on what might be called the Principle of Modes\nof Cognition: the idea that knowledge is always relativized to\ndifferent levels of knowers, who have different sorts of objects of\nknowledge. This relativization is, however, limited. The same item is\nnot true for one knower and false for another, but the way in which a\ngiven item is known differs according to the powers of the knower.\nPhilosophy develops this scheme in relation to the different levels of\nthe soul (intelligence, reason, imagination and the senses) and their\ndifferent objects (pure Form, abstract universals, images, particular\nbodily things).\n\nPhilosophy does not at this point follow the most obvious path that\nthe Modes of Cognition Principle would suggest and declare that it\njust depends on the knower whether something is known as certain or\nnot. Perhaps she accepted that there is something intrinsically\nuncertain about future contingents, whoever it is that knows them.\nRather, she reaches her conclusion through a more complex twist of the\nargument. Philosophy argues that the temporal relation of the thing\nknown to the knower\u2014whether it is known as a past, present or\nfuture event\u2014depends on the nature and cognitive power of the\nknower. God\u2019s way of being and knowing, she argues, is eternal,\nand divine eternity, she says, is not the same as just lacking a\nbeginning and end, but it is rather (V.6) \u2018the whole,\nsimultaneous and perfect possession of unbounded life.\u2019\n\nA being who is eternal in this way, Philosophy argues, knows all\nthings\u2014past, present and future\u2014in the same way as we, who\nlive in time and not eternity, know what is present. Since, therefore,\ncontingent events that are future to us are present in relation to\nGod, there is no reason why God should not know them as certain. But,\nif they can be known as certain, are they really contingent? The last\npart of Philosophy\u2019s argument deals with this problem by\naccepting that, as known by God in his eternal present, events are not\ncontingent, but necessary in a special way that does not involve any\nconstraint or limitation of freedom. There are, she explains, two\nsorts of necessity: simple and conditional. Simple necessities are\nwhat would now be called physical or nomic necessities: that the sun\nrises, or that a man will sometime die. By contrast, it is\nconditionally necessary that, for instance, I am walking,\nwhen I am walking (or when someone sees that I am walking);\nbut from this conditional necessity it does not follow that it is\nsimply necessary that I am walking. Although a number of modern\ncommentators interpret this passage as Philosophy\u2019s way of\nnoticing the scope-distinction fallacy in the original way Boethius\nthe character presents the problem, she really seems to be making a\nrather different point. On an Aristotelian understanding of modality,\nwhich Boethius the author accepted, the present is necessary:\n\u2018what is, necessarily is, when it is\u2019 (On\nInterpretation 19a23). Philosophy is arguing that, since God\nknows all things as if they were present, future events are necessary,\nin relation to their being known by God, in just the way that anything\nwhich is presently the case is necessary. And this necessity of the\npresent is an unconstraining necessity\u2014those who accepted\nAristotelian modalities did not think that because, when I am sitting,\nI am sitting necessarily, my freedom to stand has been at all\ncurtailed. Indeed, as Philosophy stresses, in themselves the future\nevents remain completely free. Philosophy is thus able to explain how,\nas known by God, future contingent events have the certainty which\nmake them proper objects of knowledge, rather than opinion, whilst\nnevertheless retaining their indeterminacy.\n\nIt is important to add, however, that most contemporary interpreters\ndo not read the argument of V.3\u20136 in quite this way. (For a\nbalanced assessment of various interpretations, including the one\noffered here, see Sharples 2009; and for a powerful critique of\naspects of the view presented here, see Michon 2015). They hold that\nPhilosophy is arguing that God is atemporal, so eliminating the\nproblems about determinism, which arise when God\u2019s knowing\nfuture contingents is seen an event in the past, and therefore,\nfixed.\n\nHowever it is interpreted, Philosophy\u2019s argument takes a\nsurprising turn at the very end of the book. When he gave his initial\nstatement of the problem, Boethius the character had distinguished the\nproblem at issue\u2014that of divine prescience\u2014from that of\ndivine predetermination. He had explained (V.3) that, for the purposes\nof their discussion, he was assuming that God does not cause the\nevents he foreknows: he knows them because they happen, rather than\ntheir happening because he foreknows them. He added, though, in\npassing, that he did not really accept this view: it is \u2018back to\nfront\u2019 to think that \u2018the outcome of things in time should\nbe the cause of eternal prescience.\u2019 Philosophy now returns to\nthis point, conceding that God\u2019s act of knowing \u2018sets the\nmeasure for all things and owes nothing to things which follow on from\nit.\u2019 Although Philosophy considers that she has successfully\nresolved the character Boethius\u2019s problems, the reader is left\nasking whether this final concession, which makes God the determiner\nof all events, does not ruin the elaborate defence of the contingency\nof human volitions she has just been mounting.\n7. Interpreting the Consolation\n\nOne, perfectly plausible, way of reading the Consolation is\nto take it, as most philosophical works are taken, at face value. On\nthis reading, Philosophy is recognized as a clearly authoritative\nfigure, whose teaching should not be doubted and whose success in\nconsoling the character Boethius must be assumed to be complete. The\napparent changes of direction noted in\n Section 5\n will be taken either as stages in Boethius\u2019s re-education or as\nunintended effects of the author\u2019s wish to make this work into a\ncompendium of a syncretistic philosophical system, and\nPhilosophy\u2019s own view that she has resolved the problem of\nprescience will be accepted as that of Boethius the author.\n\nYet there are a number of reasons which suggest that Boethius\u2019s\nintention as an author was more complex. First, it would have been\nhard for his intended audience of educated Christians to ignore the\nfact that in this dialogue a Christian, Boethius, is being instructed\nby a figure who clearly represents the tradition of pagan Philosophy,\nand who proposes some positions (on the World Soul in III m.9, and on\nthe sempiternity of the world in V.6) which most Christians would have\nfound dubious. Boethius the character says nothing which is explicitly\nChristian, but when in III.12 Philosophy says, echoing the words of\nWisdom viii, 1 that \u2018it is the highest good that rules all\nthings strongly and disposes them sweetly\u2019, he expresses his\ndelight not just in what she has said but much more \u2018in those\nvery words\u2019 that she uses\u2014a broad hint to the reader that\nhe remembers his Christian identity even in the midst of his\nphilosophical instruction.\n\nSecond, the genre Boethius chose for the Consolation, that of\nthe prosimetrum or Menippean satire, was associated with works which\nridicule the pretensions of authoritative claims to wisdom. Elements\nof satire on the claims of learning are present even in the vast,\nencyclopaedic Marriage of Mercury and Philology by the\nfifth-century author Martianus Capella, which Boethius clearly knew.\nAncient authors thought carefully about genres, and it is hard to\nthink that Boethius\u2019s choice was not a hint that\nPhilosophy\u2019s authority is not to be taken as complete. And,\nthird, in the light of these two considerations, the changes of\ndirection, incoherencies and ultimate failure of the long argument\nabout prescience, when the question is suddenly recast as one about\npredestination, all suggest themselves as intentional features, for\nwhich the interpreter must account.\n\nSome recent interpreters, such as Joel Relihan (1993, 187\u2013194;\n2007), have gone so far as to suggest that the Consolation\nshould be understood ironically as an account of the insufficiency of\nPhilosophy (and philosophy) to provide consolation, by contrast with\nChristian faith. Such a view seems too extreme, because Boethius the\nauthor has clearly taken great pains with the philosophical arguments\nproposed in the text, and the main lines of Philosophy\u2019s\nthinking fit well with the metaphysics glimpsed in the theological\ntractates and even, at moments, in the logical commentaries. It is\nplausible, however, to hold that Boethius wished, whilst acknowledging\nthe value of philosophy\u2014to which he had devoted his life, and\nfor which he presented himself as being about to die\u2014to point\nits limitations: limitations which Philosophy herself, who is keen to\nemphasize that she is not divine, accepts. Philosophy, he might be\nsuggesting, provides arguments and solutions to problems which should\nbe accepted and it teaches a way of living that should be followed,\nbut it falls short of providing a coherent and comprehensive\nunderstanding of God and his relation to creatures. Boethius the\ncharacter should be satisfied, but not completely satisfied, by\nPhilosophy\u2019s argument. And if this is Boethius the\nauthor\u2019s position in the Consolation, then it fits\nclosely with the theological method he pioneered in the opuscula\nsacra.\n8. Boethius\u2019s Influence and Importance\n\nThe influence of each area of Boethius\u2019s philosophical writing\nwas vast in the Middle Ages. Along with Augustine and Aristotle, he is\nthe fundamental philosophical and theological author in the\nLatin tradition.\n\nIn logic, Boethius\u2019s translations of Aristotle and Porphyry\n(except for that of the Posterior Analytics, which was lost)\nremained standard throughout the Middle Ages. His\ncommentaries\u2014especially that on the Categories, the\nsecond commentary on the Isagoge and the second, more\nadvanced commentary on On Interpretation\u2014were the main\ninstruments by which logicians from the ninth to the twelfth centuries\ncame to understand the Aristotelian texts he had translated, and to\ngrapple with their problems and the wider range of related\nphilosophical issues raised by the late ancient tradition. Even\ntwelfth-century philosophers as independently-minded as Abelard and\nGilbert of Poitiers were deeply indebted to these commentaries. The\nlogical text-books were equally important. Before the Prior\nAnalytics became generally available in the later twelfth\ncentury, students learned syllogistic from Boethius\u2019s monographs\non it. The theory of topical argument, acquired especially from On\nTopical Differentiae, provided a framework for twelfth-century\nphilosophers in propounding and analysing arguments, and from the\ncombination of studying topical argument and the theory of\nhypothetical syllogisms as Boethius presented it, Abelard was led\ntowards his rediscovery of propositional logic (cf. Martin (1987)).\nFrom the thirteenth century, onwards, however, both Boethius\u2019s\ncommentaries and his treatises became less influential. On Topical\nDifferentiae, and On Division, continued to be studied,\nbut not the treatises on categorical and hypothetical syllogisms.\nUsers of the commentaries were infrequent, but they include Thomas\nAquinas.\n\nThe theological treatises were probably already known by the pupils of\nAlcuin at the court of Charlemagne around 800, and a tradition of\nglosses to the text probably goes back to the School of Auxerre in the\nlater ninth century. The opuscula sacra provided a model for\nearly medieval thinkers who wanted to use their logical training in\nthinking about Christian doctrine. Anselm was certainly aware of them,\nthough he looked more closely to Augustine; Abelard\u2019s first\ntheological work, the Theologia Summi Boni, despite its\noriginality, is clearly inspired by Boethius\u2019s first treatise\n(on the Trinity). In the 1140s, Gilbert of Poitiers expounded his\nmetaphysics and his view of theology in a detailed exegesis of the\nopuscula sacra, which came to be the standard commentary,\nalthough the treatises were also commented on by other, more\nPlatonically-minded twelfth-century scholars. Although the\nopuscula sacra were not formally a part of the theology\ncurriculum in most later medieval universities, they continued to be\nstudied, and Aquinas wrote commentaries on Treatises I and III.\n\nThough the influence of these other works was great, the popularity\nand importance of the Consolation far exceeded it. The text\nalready echoes in what must be one of the earliest pieces of genuinely\nmedieval Latin philosophy, the little treatise \u2018On True\nPhilosophy\u2019 with which Alcuin prefaced his De\ngrammatica, and it remained a favourite through the later Middle\nAges and into the Renaissance. Not until the time of Gibbon had it\nbeen reduced to an object of the historian\u2019s condescending\nadmiration. One measure of the extent and character of its readership\nis the translations, not merely into almost every medieval vernacular,\nbut also into Greek and even Hebrew. Among the translators were two of\nthe greatest vernacular writers of the whole epoch: Jean de Meun, who\nput the Consolation into Old French in the later thirteenth\ncentury, and Chaucer, who translated it into Middle English about a\ncentury later. As their involvement suggests, Boethius\u2019s\ndialogue was a text which popularized philosophy outside the\nuniversities, and its literary features, as well as its arguments,\ninspired imitations and creative adaptations, from Alain of\nLille\u2019s De planctu Naturae (\u2018Nature\u2019s\nLament\u2019) to, more distantly, Dante\u2019s Convivio and\neven Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde. Philosophers and\ntheologians, too, used the work; it was part of the school syllabus\nfrom the ninth to the twelfth centuries, and although\nAristotle\u2019s treatises left no room for it in the university\ncurriculum, it continued to be studied by students and teachers there.\nFor example, Aquinas\u2019s account of the highest good in his\nSumma Theologiae IaIIe builds on the Consolation,\nand the definition of eternity given by Philosophy in Book V became\nthe starting-point for almost every later medieval discussion of God\nand time. Moreover, the Consolation continued to be important\nin philosophical discussions right up to the end of the seventeenth\ncentury (cf. Belli 2011).\n\nThe Consolation had many medieval commentaries\u2014mostly\non the whole text, although some just examined Book III, m. 9. In the\ntenth and eleventh centuries, the commentary written by Remigius of\nAuxerre was the most widely read (and often adapted). William of\nConches\u2019s commentary, written in the 1120s, became standard in\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the commentary by the English\nDominican, Nicholas Trivet, from the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury, was the most popular in the late Middle Ages. One of the\ncentral problems which faced any commentator was the relation of the\ntext to Christian teaching. Remigius and, in a subtler way, William\nboth took Boethius, whom they knew to be a Christian, to be putting\nforward Christian doctrine without seeming to do so; Trivet\u2019s\napproach is less syncretistic, although he finds nothing unacceptable\nfor Christians in the Consolation. \n\nThe preceding paragraphs in this section might seem to indicate that\nthere is no doubt about Boethius\u2019s importance as a philosopher.\nYet the very size of his medieval influence has led to an attitude,\nwidespread among historians of philosophy (see especially Courcelle\n(1967)), which makes Boethius almost disappear as a figure in his own\nright. He is seen, rather, as a conduit through which Greek\nphilosophical ideas were transmitted to the Latin tradition. Of\ncourse, one aspect of Boethius\u2019s influence is indeed that he\nmade available ideas and arguments deriving from Plato, Aristotle,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and Iamblichus. But he was also an\nindividual thinker, with pronounced tastes and views, no less (if no\nmore) original than his Greek contemporaries; and also, in the\nConsolation, one of the rare philosophers whose thought, like\nPlato\u2019s, cannot be neatly separated from the complex literary\nform in which it is expressed.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Texts in Latin", "Selected English (and other) Translations of Primary Texts", "Selected Secondary Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Texts in Latin": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>De institutione musica</em>, G.
