    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism?\n1. What is Mathematical Platonism?\n\nMathematical platonism can be defined as the conjunction of the\nfollowing three theses:\n\nExistence.\nThere are mathematical objects.\nAbstractness.\nMathematical objects are abstract.\nIndependence.\nMathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents and\ntheir language, thought, and practices.\n\n\nSome representative definitions of \u2018mathematical\nplatonism\u2019 are listed in the supplement\n\nSome Definitions of Platonism\n\n\nand document that the above definition is fairly standard.\n\nPlatonism in general (as opposed to platonism about mathematics\nspecifically) is any view that arises from the above three claims by\nreplacing the adjective \u2018mathematical\u2019 by any other\nadjective.\n\nThe first two claims are tolerably clear for present purposes.\nExistence can be formalized as \u2018\\(\\exists\nxMx\\)\u2019, where \u2018\\(Mx\\)\u2019 abbreviates the predicate\n\u2018\\(x\\) is a mathematical object\u2019 which is true of all and\nonly the objects studied by pure mathematics, such as numbers, sets,\nand functions. Abstractness says that every\nmathematical object is abstract, where an object is said to be\nabstract just in case it is non-spatiotemporal and (therefore)\ncausally inefficacious. (For further discussion, see the entry on\n abstract objects.)\n\nIndependence is less clear than the other two claims.\nWhat does it mean to ascribe this sort of independence to an object?\nThe most obvious gloss is probably the counterfactual conditional\nthat, had there not been any intelligent agents, or had their\nlanguage, thought, or practices been different, there would still have\nbeen mathematical objects. However, it is doubtful that this gloss\nwill do all the work that Independence is supposed to\ndo (see Section\n 4.1).\n For now, Independence will be left somewhat\nschematic.\n",
