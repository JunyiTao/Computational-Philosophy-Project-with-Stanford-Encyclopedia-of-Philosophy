Three Dimensions of Socialist Views\n\nWhen characterizing socialist views, it is useful to distinguish\nbetween three dimensions of a conception of a social justice (Gilabert\n2017a). We identify these three dimensions as:\n\n\n (DI) the core ideals\nand principles animating that conception of justice;\n (DII) the social\ninstitutions and practices implementing the ideals specified at\nDI;\n (DIII) the processes\nof transformation leading agents and their society from where they are\ncurrently, to the social outcome specified in DII.\n\n\n\nThe characterization of capitalism and socialism in the previous\nsection focuses on the social institutions and practices constituting\neach form of society (i.e., on DII). We step back from this\ninstitutional dimension in section 3, below, to consider the central\nnormative commitments of socialism (DI) and to survey their deployment\nin the socialist critique of capitalism. We then, in\n section 4,\n engage in a more detailed discussion of accounts of the institutional\nshape of socialism (DII), exploring the various proposed\nimplementations of socialist ideals and principles outlined under DI.\nWe turn to accounts of the transition to socialism (DIII) in\n section 5.\n",
