    "main_text": "Responding to the Problem: Three Approaches || Incoherence\n4.3 Incoherence\n\nAccording to this approach, it is simply incoherent to accept\nor deny the existence of some type(s) of moral luck. This\napproach has been used for constitutive luck in particular.\n\nAmong those who wish to preserve the centrality of morality in our\nlives, many have appealed to an idea formulated by Nicholas Rescher\n(1993), according to which \u201c[o]ne cannot meaningfully said to be\nlucky in regard to who one is, but only with respect to what happens\nto one. Identity must precede luck\u201d (155). It is easy to take\nRescher\u2019s point out of context without realizing that he is\nworking with a notion of luck that differs from the notion of\n\u201clack of control.\u201d According to Rescher, something is\nlucky if (i) it came about \u201cby accident\u201d where this seems\nto mean something like \u201cunplanned\u201d or\n\u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d and (ii)\nthe outcome \u201chas a significantly evaluative status in\nrepresenting a good or bad result, a benefit or loss\u201d(145).\nTaken this way, it does seem at least very odd to say that one\u2019s\nidentity is (or is not) a matter of luck. But it is less clear that\nthere is anything odd\u2014let alone incoherent\u2014about saying\nthat one\u2019s identity is not a matter within one\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nCould there nevertheless be some truth to Rescher\u2019s claim even\nif we understand \u201cluck\u201d as \u201cout of one\u2019s\ncontrol?\u201d Perhaps it does not make sense, for example, to say\nthat a person is in control of who she is. For one could argue that\nthis would amount to saying that a person is a self-creator. And in\nfact the Control Principle, taken to its logical extreme, seems to\nlead to just such a requirement (see, e.g., Browne 1992, Nagel 1986,\n118). If it turns out that self-creation is conceptually impossible as\nmany argue (e.g., Galen Strawson 1986), then perhaps there is a sense\nin which it is right to say that being in control of one\u2019s\nconstitution makes no sense. But it does not follow from this that it\nis meaningless to deny that one can control one\u2019s\nconstitution.\n\nPerhaps the best way of deploying the insight that there is something\nspecial about luck and constitution is not to say that it is\nmeaningless to discuss it, but to say that constitutive moral luck is\nsimply unproblematic for morality in the way that resultant moral luck\nis. This would be to take up the \u201cline-drawing\u201d challenge\nas described in the last section. On this line of reasoning, for\npurposes of moral assessment, it does not matter how you came to be;\nwhat matters is what you do with what you are. Of course, as we saw,\nthis requires defense and explanation, but it is a way of capturing\nthe insight that constitutive luck is relevantly different from the\nresultant luck that has captivated a number of commentators.\n",
