    "main_text": "Wisdom as Knowledge\n3. Wisdom as Knowledge\n\n\nAn alternative approach to wisdom focuses on the more positive idea\nthat wise people are very knowledgeable people. There are many views\nin the historical and contemporary philosophical literature on wisdom\nthat have knowledge, as opposed to humility or accuracy, as at least a\nnecessary condition of wisdom.  Aristotle (Nichomachean\nEthics VI, ch. 7), Descartes (Principles of Philosophy),\nRichard Garrett (1996), John Kekes (1983), Keith Lehrer & Nicholas\nSmith (1996), Robert Nozick (1989), Plato (The Republic),\nSharon Ryan (1996, 1999), Valerie Tiberius (2008), Dennis Whitcomb\n(2010) and Linda Zagzebski (1996) for example, have all defended\ntheories of wisdom that require a wise person to have knowledge of\nsome sort.  All of these views very clearly distinguish knowledge from\nexpertise on a particular subject.  Moreover, all of these views\nmaintain that wise people know \u201cwhat is important.\u201d The\nviews differ, for the most part, over what it is important for a wise\nperson to know, and on whether there is any behavior, action, or way\nof living, that is required for wisdom. \n\n\nAristotle distinguished between two different kinds of wisdom,\ntheoretical wisdom and practical wisdom. Theoretical wisdom is,\naccording to Aristotle, \u201cscientific knowledge, combined with\nintuitive reason, of the things that are highest by nature\u201d\n(Nicomachean Ethics, VI, 1141b).  For Aristotle, theoretical\nwisdom involves knowledge of necessary, scientific, first principles\nand propositions that can be logically deduced from them.  Aristotle\u2019s\nidea that scientific knowledge is knowledge of necessary truths and\ntheir logical consequences is no longer a widely accepted view. Thus,\nfor the purposes of this discussion, I will consider a theory that\nreflects the spirit of Aristotle\u2019s view on theoretical wisdom, but\nwithout the controversy about the necessary or contingent nature of\nscientific knowledge. Moreover, it will combine scientific knowledge\nwith other kinds of factual knowledge, including knowledge about\nhistory, philosophy, music, literature, mathematics, etc. Consider the\nfollowing, knowledge based, theory of wisdom:\n\nWisdom as Extensive Factual Knowledge (WFK):\nS is wise iff S has extensive factual knowledge about\nscience, history, philosophy, literature, music, etc.\n\n\nAccording to (WFK), a wise person is a person who knows a lot about\nthe universe and our place in it. She would have extensive knowledge\nabout the standard academic subjects. There are many positive things\nto say about (WFK). (WFK) nicely distinguishes between narrow\nexpertise and knowledge of the mundane, from the important, broad, and\ngeneral kind of knowledge possessed by wise people. As Aristotle puts\nit, \u201c\u2026we think that some people are wise in general, not\nin some particular field or in any other limited\nrespect\u2026\u201d (Nicomachean Ethics, Book 6,\n1141a). \n\n\nThe main problem for (WFK) is that some of the most knowledgeable\npeople are not wise. Although they have an abundance of very important\nfactual knowledge, they lack the kind of practical know-how that is a\nmark of a wise person. Wise people know how to get on in the world in\nall kinds of situations and with all kinds of people. Extensive\nfactual knowledge is not enough to give us what a wise person\nknows. As Robert Nozick points out, \u201cWisdom is not just knowing\nfundamental truths, if these are unconnected with the guidance of life\nor with a perspective on its meaning\u201d (1989, 269).  There is more to\nwisdom than intelligence and knowledge of science and philosophy or\nany other subject matter. Aristotle is well aware of the limitations\nof what he calls theoretical wisdom.    However, rather\nthan making improvements to something like (WFK), Aristotle\ndistinguishes it as one kind of wisdom. Other philosophers would be\nwilling to abandon (WFK), that is, claim that it provides insufficient\nconditions for wisdom, and add on what is missing.\n\n\nAristotle has a concept of practical wisdom that makes up for what is\nmissing in theoretical wisdom. In Book VI of the Nicomachean\nEthics, he claims, \u201cThis is why we say Anaxagoras, Thales,\nand men like them have philosophic but not practical wisdom, when we\nsee them ignorant of what is to their own advantage, and why we say\nthat they know things that are remarkable, admirable, difficult, and\ndivine, but useless; viz. because it is not human goods they\nseek\u201d (1141a).  Knowledge of contingent facts that are useful to\nliving well is required in Aristotle\u2019s practical wisdom. According to\nAristotle, \u201cNow it is thought to be the mark of a man of\npractical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about what is good and\nexpedient for himself, not in some particular respect, e.g. about what\nsorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but about what sorts\nof thing conduce to the good life in general\u201d (Nichomachean\nEthics, VI, 1140a\u20131140b).  Thus, for Aristotle, practical\nwisdom requires knowing, in general, how to live well. Many\nphilosophers agree with Aristotle on this point. However, many would\nnot be satisfied with the conclusion that theoretical wisdom is one\nkind of wisdom and practical wisdom another. Other philosophers,\nincluding Linda Zagzebski (1996), agree that there are these two types\nof wisdom that ought to be distinguished.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed, without argument, on the assumption that it is possible\nto have a theory of one, general, kind of wisdom.  Wisdom, in general,\nmany philosophers would argue, requires practical knowledge about\nliving. What Aristotle calls theoretical wisdom, many would contend,\nis not wisdom at all.  Aristotle\u2019s theoretical wisdom is merely\nextensive knowledge or deep understanding.  Nicholas Maxwell (1984),\nin his argument to revolutionize education, argues that we should be\nteaching for wisdom, which he sharply distinguishes from standard\nacademic knowledge. Similar points are raised by Robert Sternberg\n(2001) and Andrew Norman (1996).  Robert Nozick holds a view very\nsimilar to Aristotle\u2019s theory of practical wisdom, but Nozick is\ntrying to capture the essence of wisdom, period. He is not trying to\ndefine one, alternative, kind of wisdom. Nozick claims, \u201cWisdom\nis what you need to understand in order to live well and cope with the\ncentral problems and avoid the dangers in the predicaments human\nbeings find themselves in\u201d (1989, 267).  And, John Kekes\nmaintains that, \u201cWhat a wise man knows, therefore, is how to\nconstruct a pattern that, given the human situation, is likely to lead\nto a good life\u201d (1983, 280).  More recently, Valerie Tiberius (2008)\nhas developed a practical view that connects wisdom with well being,\nrequiring, among other things, that a wise person live the sort of\nlife that he or she could sincerely endorse upon reflection.  Such\npractical views of wisdom could be expressed, generally, as\nfollows.\n\nWisdom as Knowing How To Live Well (KLW): \nS is wise iff S knows how to live well.\n\n\nThis view captures Aristotle\u2019s basic idea of practical wisdom. It also\ncaptures an important aspect of views defended by Nozick, Plato,\nGarrett, Kekes, Maxwell, Ryan, and Tiberius. Although giving an\naccount of what it means to know how to live well may prove as\ndifficult a topic as providing an account of wisdom, Nozick provides a\nvery illuminating start.\n\n\nWisdom is not just one type of knowledge, but diverse. \nWhat a wise person needs to know and understand constitutes a varied\nlist: the most important goals and values of life \u2013 the ultimate\ngoal, if there is one; what means will reach these goals without too\ngreat a cost; what kinds of dangers threaten the achieving of these\ngoals; how to recognize and avoid or minimize these dangers; what\ndifferent types of human beings are like in their actions and motives\n(as this presents dangers or opportunities); what is not possible or\nfeasible to achieve (or avoid); how to tell what is appropriate when;\nknowing when certain goals are sufficiently achieved; what limitations\nare unavoidable and how to accept them; how to improve oneself and\none\u2019s relationships with others or society; knowing what the true and\nunapparent value of various things is;  when to take a long-term\nview; knowing the variety and obduracy of facts, institutions, and\nhuman nature; understanding what one\u2019s real motives are; how to cope\nand deal with the major tragedies and dilemmas of life, and with the\nmajor good things\n too. (1989, 269) \n\n\nWith Nozick\u2019s explanation of what one must know in order to live well,\nwe have an interesting and quite attractive, albeit somewhat rough,\ntheory of wisdom. As noted above, many philosophers, including\nAristotle and Zagzebski would, however, reject (KLW) as the full story\non wisdom.  Aristotle and Zagzebski would obviously reject (KLW) as\nthe full story because they believe theoretical wisdom is another kind\nof wisdom, and are unwilling to accept that there is a conception of\none, general, kind of wisdom. Kekes claims, \u201cThe possession of\nwisdom shows itself in reliable, sound, reasonable, in a word, good\njudgment. In good judgment, a person brings his knowledge to bear on\nhis actions. To understand wisdom, we have to understand its\nconnection with knowledge, action, and judgment\u201d (1983, 277).  Kekes\nadds, \u201cWisdom ought also to show in the man who has it\u201d\n(1983, 281).  Many philosophers, therefore, think that wisdom is not\nrestricted even to knowledge about how to live well. Tiberius thinks\nthe wise person\u2019s actions reflect their basic values.  These\nphilosophers believe that being wise also includes action. A person\ncould satisfy the conditions of any of the principles we have\nconsidered thus far and nevertheless behave in a wildly reckless\nmanner. Wildly reckless people are, even if very knowledgeable about\nlife, not wise.\n\nPhilosophers who are attracted to the idea that knowing how to live\nwell is a necessary condition for wisdom might want to simply tack on\na success condition to (KLW) to get around cases in which a person\nknows all about living well, yet fails to put this knowledge into\npractice. Something along the lines of the following theory would\ncapture this idea.\n\nWisdom as Knowing How To, and Succeeding at, Living\nWell (KLS): \nS is wise iff  (i) S knows how to live well, and\n (ii) S is successful at living well.\n \n\n\nThe idea of the success condition is that one puts one\u2019s knowledge\ninto practice.  Or, rather than using the terminology of success, one\nmight require that a wise person\u2019s beliefs and values cohere with\none\u2019s actions (Tiberius, 2008).  The main idea is that one\u2019s actions\nare reflective of one\u2019s understanding of what it means to live well.\nA view along the lines of (KLS) would be embraced by Aristotle and\nZagzebski (for practical wisdom), and by Kekes, Nozick, and\nTiberius. (KLS) would not be universally embraced, however (see Ryan\n1999, for further criticisms).  One criticism of (KLS) is that one\nmight think that all the factual knowledge required by (WFK) is\nmissing from this theory. One might argue that (WFK), the view that a\nwise person has extensive factual knowledge, was rejected only because\nit did not provide sufficient conditions for wisdom. Many philosophers\nwould claim that (WFK) does provide a necessary condition for\nwisdom. A wise person, such a critic would argue, needs to know how to\nlive well (as described by Nozick), but she also needs to have some\ndeep and far-reaching theoretical, or factual, knowledge that may have\nvery little impact on her daily life, practical decisions, or\nwell being. In the preface of his Principles of Philosophy,\nDescartes insisted upon factual knowledge as an important component of\nwisdom. Descartes wrote, \u201cIt is really only God alone who has\nPerfect Wisdom, that is to say, who has a complete knowledge of the\ntruth of all things; but it may be said that men have more wisdom or\nless according as they have more or less knowledge of the most\nimportant truths\u201d (Principles, 204).  Of course, among\nthose important truths, one might claim, are truths about living well,\nas well as knowledge in the basic academic subject areas.\n\n\nMoreover, one might complain that the insight left standing from\nEpistemic Accuracy theories is also missing from (KLS). One might\nthink that a wise person not only knows a lot, and succeeds at living\nwell, she also confines her claims to knowledge (or belief that she\nhas knowledge) to those propositions that she is justified in\nbelieving. \n",
