    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Natural Theology\n5.4 Natural Theology\n\nWolff\u2019s treatment of metaphysics concludes with a consideration\nof natural theology defined as \u201cthe science of those things that\nare possible through God\u201d (NT: I, \u00a71, see Corr 1973). Yet, at the same\ntime, natural theology also provides a bottom-up justification for\nmetaphysics insofar as metaphysics is concerned with actual existing\nbeings of a contingent, and so created, reality. Wolff indicates that\nnatural theology has two principle aims: (1) to prove the existence of\nGod and (2) to determine what pertains to the essence and attributes\nof God, and what follows from these.\n\nConcerning the demonstration of God\u2019s existence, Wolff had\noffered criticisms (much to the chagrin of his Pietist opponents) of a\nvariety of traditional proofs early in his career (cf. Theis 2018:\n221\u20133). In his Natural Theology, however, Wolff\npresents and defends two proofs: an a posteriori proof\npresented at the outset of the first volume, and an a priori\nproof provided at the beginning of the second. Wolff\u2019s a\nposteriori proof sets out from the fact (elaborated at the outset\nof empirical psychology) that we exist, and proceeds to argue that the\nreason for our existence must be found in a necessary being:\n\n\nThe human soul exists or we exist. Since nothing is without a\nsufficient reason why it is rather than is not, a sufficient reason\nmust be given why our soul exists, or why we exist. Now this reason is\ncontained in ourselves or in some other being diverse from us. But if\nyou maintain that we have the reason of our existence in a being\nwhich, in turn, has the reason of its existence in another, you will\nnot arrive at the sufficient reason unless you come to a halt at some\nbeing which does have the sufficient reason of its own existence in\nitself. Therefore, either we ourselves are the necessary being, or\nthere is given a necessary being other and diverse from us.\nConsequently, a necessary being exists (NT: I, \u00a724).\n\n\nFrom there, Wolff argues that the necessary being must also be\nindependent, or have its sufficient reason in itself, and cannot have\na beginning or end in time or is eternal. As such, the necessary being\ncannot be identified with the world (which is composite) or anything\nwithin it (since these have a beginning and end); moreover, it cannot\nbe identified with the soul since unlike the soul it does not depend\non the world. Therefore, the necessary being is identified as God,\nunderstood as an independent being in which the reason for the\nactuality of the world and the soul is found (NT: I, \u00a767, see Corr 1973).\n\nBy contrast, Wolff\u2019s a priori proof for God\u2019s\nexistence proceeds from the identification of God as the most perfect\nbeing (ens perfectissimum):\n\n\nGod contains all compossible realities in the absolutely highest\ndegree. But He is possible. Wherefore, since the possible can exist,\nexistence can belong to it. Consequently, since existence is a\nreality, and since realities are compossible which can belong to a\nbeing, existence is in the class of compossible realities. Moreover,\nnecessary existence is the absolutely highest degree. Therefore,\nnecessary existence belongs to God or, what is the same, God\nnecessarily exists (NT: II, \u00a721, see Corr 1973).\n\n\nFrom the notion of a most perfect being, Wolff purports to prove God\nis an ens realissimum (or most real existing being). However,\nlike Leibniz before him commenting on the Cartesian ontological proof,\nWolff believes God must first be shown to be possible in order to be\nshown to exist. According to Wolff, arriving at the knowledge of God\nas an ens perfectissimum involves first contemplating the\nattributes that are present in the human soul, to a limited degree,\nand then extrapolating those attributes as unlimited qualities to God.\nThings are compossible insofar as they can coexist in the same\nsubject. Since existence is a mode or reality for Wolff, existence is\nconsidered to fall within the class of compossible realities. And just\nas it is better to exist than not to exist, it is better to exist\nnecessarily than just to exist contingently, therefore Wolff concludes\nthat God\u2019s existence is necessary.\n\nWith God\u2019s existence assured, Wolff considers what can be known\nof Him. God is taken to have an understanding, consisting in His\ndistinct representation of all possible worlds and which\nrepresentation itself originates from the divine essence (NT: II,\n\u00a7\u00a781, 84). God is also shown to have a will, through which\nHe chooses one possible world to make actual, and since God\u2019s\nchoice in doing so finds its sufficient reason in his distinct\ncognition of the supreme perfection of that world, Wolff identifies\nGod\u2019s will as free (in the same sense of freedom\npresented in the empirical psychology, albeit in the highest possible\ndegree\u2014NT: II, \u00a7277). Wolff additionally considers\nGod\u2019s wisdom, which consists in His choice of the\nappropriate means to realize His end in creation, namely, the\nmanifestation of His own glory and perfection (NT: I, \u00a7629), and\ngoodness, which consists in His conferring of as much\ngoodness on creatures as is consistent with His wisdom (NT: I,\n\u00a7\u00a7697\u20139).\n\nWhile these discussions conclude the proper subject matter of natural\ntheology, in the second half of the second volume Wolff additionally\nturns to critically examining various systems of atheism and radical\nthought. Significantly, among the views discussed is\nSpinozism, and indeed his treatment is considerably detailed\n(spanning \u00a7\u00a7671\u2013716 of the second volume), likely\nreflecting the fact that Wolff had himself faced a persistent\naccusation of supporting Spinoza on the part of his Pietist critics.\nIn contrast, however, with other discussions of Spinoza by\nphilosophers of this period, Wolff\u2019s does not trade in\nconvenient caricatures or speculation concerning the real (immoral)\nmotives behind Spinoza\u2019s thought but hews closely, if\ncritically, to the text of the Ethics. Wolff scrutinizes\nSpinoza\u2019s definitions, particularly of God, substance,\nattribute, mode, and finite thing (which he contrasts with their\nproper definitions in the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy), and\nproceeds to show how these figure into Spinoza\u2019s account of\nextension (NT: II, \u00a7\u00a7688\u201393), doctrine of bodies\n(\u00a7\u00a7694\u20136), claims of the uniqueness and necessary\nexistence of substance (\u00a7\u00a7697\u2013706), and his faulty\naccount of infinite thought as composed of an infinite number of\nfinite thinking things (\u00a7\u00a7707\u20138). Wolff\u2019s\ndiscussion proved rather influential, with Mendelssohn echoing and\ndeveloping it, and the accuracy of Wolff\u2019s characterization of\nSpinoza was also a point of discussion in the famous\nPantheismusstreit (cf. Beiser 1987: 103).\n",
