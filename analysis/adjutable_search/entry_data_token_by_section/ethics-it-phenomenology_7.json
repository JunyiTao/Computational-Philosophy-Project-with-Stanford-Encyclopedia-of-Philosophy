    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches to Technology || The Technological Attitude in Contemporary Society and Technologies\n2.3 The Technological Attitude in Contemporary Society and Technologies\n\nPhenomenology has not only been used to address questions of\nphilosophical anthropology, as one might suggest is the case with\nHeidegger and Stiegler. Hubert Dreyfus (1992) has used it very\neffectively to provided a devastating critique of the classical\nprogram in artificial intelligence (AI) research. In his critique\nDreyfus (1992) argues that the way skill development has become\nunderstood in the past has been wrong. He argues\u2014using the\nearlier work of Heidegger in Being and Time\u2014that the\nclassical conception of skill development, going back as far as Plato,\nassumes that we start with the particular cases and then abstract from\nthese to discover and internalize more and more sophisticated and\ngeneral rules. Indeed, he argues, this is the model that the early\nartificial intelligence community uncritically adopted. In opposition\nto this view he argues, with Heidegger, that what we observe when we\nlearn a new skill in everyday practice is in fact the opposite. We\nmost often start with explicit rules or preformulated approaches and\nthen move to a multiplicity of particular cases, as we become an\nexpert. His argument draws directly on Heidegger\u2019s account in\nBeing and Time of humans as beings that are always already\nsituated in-the-world. As humans \u2018in-the-world\u2019 we are\nalready experts at going about everyday life, at dealing with the\nsubtleties of every particular situation\u2014that is why everyday\nlife seems so obvious. Thus, the intricate expertise of everyday\nactivity is forgotten and taken for granted by AI as an assumed\nstarting point.\n\nDreyfus proceeds to give an account of five stages of becoming an\nexpert as a way to critique the programme of AI. In his account a\nnovice acts according to conscious and context-free rules and\ngenerally lacks a sense of the overall task and situational elements.\nThe advanced beginner adds, through experience, situational aspects to\nthe context-free rules to gain access to a more sophisticated\nunderstanding of the situation. The relationship between the\nsituational aspects and rules are learned through carefully chosen\nexamples, as it is difficult to formalize them. The competent person\nwill have learnt to recognize a multiplicity of context-free rules and\nsituational aspects. However, this may lead to being overwhelmed as it\nbecomes difficult to know what to include or exclude. The competent\nindividual learns to take a particular perspective on the situation,\nthereby reducing the complexity. However, such \u2018taking of a\nstand\u2019 means a certain level of risk taking is involved that\nrequires commitment and personal involvement. For the proficient most\ntasks are performed intuitively. As an involved and situated actor the\nrelevant situational aspects show up as part of the ongoing activity\nand need not be formalized. Nevertheless, a pause may still be\nrequired to think analytically about a relevant response. For the\nexpert relevant situational aspects as well as appropriate actions\nemerge as an implicit part of the ongoing activity within which the\nexpert is totally absorbed, involved, and committed. The task is\nperformed intuitively, almost all the time. In the ongoing activity of\nthe expert thousands of special cases are discriminated and dealt with\nappropriately.\n\nWith this phenomenological account of skill development in hand it is\neasy to see the problem for the development of AI programmes.\nComputing machines need some form of formal rules (a program) to\noperate. Any attempt to move from the formal to the particular, as\ndescribed by Dreyfus above, will be limited by the ability of the\nprogrammer to formulate rules for such a shift. Thus, what the\ncomputer lacks (and we as human beings have) is an already there\nfamiliarity with the world that it can draw upon as the transcendental\nhorizon of meaning to discern the relevant from the irrelevant in\nongoing activity\u2014i.e., the computer is not already a\nskilled actor (a being-in-the-world in Heidegger\u2019s terms). The\ncritique of Dreyfus was one of the major factors that pushed AI\nresearchers into new ways of thinking about AI\u2014in particular the\ndevelopment of the embodied cognition programme of the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab.\n\nWhat Dreyfus highlighted in his critique of AI was the fact that\ntechnology (AI algorithms) does not make sense by itself. It is the\nassumed, and forgotten, horizon of everyday practice that make\ntechnological devices and solutions show up as meaningful. If we are\nto understand technology we need to \u2018return\u2019 to the\nhorizon of meaning that made it show up as the artifacts we need, want\nand desire. We also need to consider how these technologies reveal (or\ndisclose) us. For example the microscope can reveal us as\n\u2018inquisitive\u2019, the gun as \u2018aggressive\u2019, or the\nmobile phone as \u2018communicative\u2019, and so forth. The ongoing\nco-constitution of society and technology, phenomenology\u2019s\ninsight, can help us to understand and make sense of complex\ninformation technology, such as AI, but also more mundane technologies\nsuch as word processors (Heim 1999).\n\nIn thinking about our relationship with technology in modern\ncontemporary life Albert Borgmann (1984) takes up the question of the\npossibility of a \u2018free\u2019 relation with modern technology in\nwhich everything is not already \u2018framed\u2019 (in\nHeidegger\u2019s sense) as resources for our projects. He agrees with\nHeidegger\u2019s analysis that modern technology is a phenomenon that\ntends to \u2018frame\u2019 our relation with things, and ultimately\nourselves and others, in a one-dimensional manner\u2014the world as\nsimply available resources for our projects. He argues that modern\ntechnology frames the world for us as \u2018devices\u2019. By this\nhe means that modern technology as devices hides the full\nreferentiality (or contextuality) of the world\u2014the worldhood of\nthe world\u2014upon which the devices depend for their ongoing\nfunctioning. Differently stated, they do not disclose the multiplicity\nof necessary conditions for them to be what they are. In fact, just\nthe opposite, they try to hide the necessary effort for them to be\navailable for use. A thermostat on the wall that we simply set at a\ncomfortable temperature now replaces the process of chopping wood,\nbuilding the fire and maintaining it. Our relationship with the\nenvironment is now reduced to, and disclosed to us as a control that\nwe simply set to our liking. In this way devices\n\u2018de-world\u2019 our relationship with things by disconnecting\nus from the full actuality (or contextuality) of everyday life. By\nrelieving us of the burden\u2014of making and maintaining fires in\nour example\u2014our relationship with the world becomes disclosed in\na new way, as simply there, already available for us. Obviously, this\nis sometimes necessary otherwise the burden of everyday life might\njust be too much. Nevertheless, if the \u2018device mood\u2019\nbecomes the way in which we conduct ourselves towards the world then\nthis will obviously have important moral and ethical implications for\nothers who may then become disclosed as devices.\n\nAgainst such a disengaging relationship with things in the world\nBorgmann argues for the importance of focal practices based on focal\nthings. Focal things solicit our full and engaging presence. We can\nthink of the focal practice of preparing and enjoying a meal with\nfriends or family as opposed to a solitary consumption of a fast food\nmeal. If we take Borgmann\u2019s analysis seriously we might conclude\nthat we, as contemporary humans surrounded by devices, are doomed\nincreasingly to relate to the world in a disengaged manner. Such a\ntotalizing conclusion would be inappropriate since the prevailing mood\ndoes not determine our relationship with those we encounter.\nNevertheless, Borgmann\u2019s analysis does point to the possibility\nof the emergence of a device mood\u2014as we increasingly depend on\ndevices\u2014and our moral obligation not to settle mindlessly into\nthe convenience that devices may offer us. Otherwise we might, as\nHeidegger (1977) argued, become the devices of our devices.\n",
