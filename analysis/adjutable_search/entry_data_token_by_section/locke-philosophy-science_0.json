    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nTwo features of Locke\u2019s intellectual landscape are most salient\nfor understanding his philosophy of science, one of which concerns the\nnew science\u2019s methodology, and the other its content. First,\nthen, is the new methodological approach to understanding the natural\nworld. This approach is accompanied by profound shifts in disciplinary\nboundaries and in conceptions of induction and scientific knowledge.\nLocke\u2019s reaction is mostly progressive. Impressed by\nexperimental methods and cognizant of their poor fit with the\nAristotelian ideal, he defines a distinct kind of knowledge, one\ninferior to genuine scientific knowledge but appropriate to human\nsensory capacities. In so doing, he develops an epistemological basis\nfor the new, experimental philosophy. Yet his reaction also has its\nconservative aspect, one that some see as having limited him in the\nface of the new science\u2019s evolving methodology. He retains an\nideal notion of scientific knowledge as demonstrative and certain, and\nwhile the speculative systems of the Aristotelians and the Cartesians.\nare the two main targets of his Essay, he shares that ideal\nwith them.\n\nThe second salient feature is the dominant scientific theory of\nLocke\u2019s day: the new science\u2019s corpuscular hypothesis. As\ndefined for the purposes of this article, the corpuscular hypothesis\n(i) takes observable bodies to be composed of material particles or\ncorpuscles, (ii) takes impulse (action by surface impact) to be either\nthe primary or sole means of communicating motion, and (iii) attempts\nto reduce colour and other qualities at the level of observable bodies\nto the primary or inherent properties of the particles composing those\nbodies. In what may be called its orthodox version (\u201cpure\nmechanism,\u201d as Ayers (1981, p. 212) calls it) the corpuscular\nhypothesis restricts those inherent properties to size, shape, number,\nand motion, and holds that all other qualities and operations are\nexplicable in terms of that restricted set of properties. The orthodox\nversion thus implies a proviso of contact action\u2014that\nbodies causally interact only locally, by impact, such that unmediated\naction at a distance is deemed impossible. (Although a number of\ncommentators use the terms \u2018corpuscular hypothesis\u2019 and\n\u2018mechanism\u2019 interchangeably, distinguishing them has\ncertain benefits. For instance, it permits us to classify Isaac Newton\namong the corpuscularian theoristis without engaging the debate about\nwhether he adhered to the contact action proviso. The definitions\ngiven here also agree largely with those in the entry on\n John Locke.)\n Plenist and atomist versions of the corpuscular hypothesis may be\ndistinguished. Plenist theorists deny the void and assert a plenum of\nmatter, as Descartes does by identifying matter with extension, and\nthough these theorists speak of particles, their particles are not\natoms, being infinitely or at least indefinitely divisible. Atomist\ntheorists, by contrast, accept the void and take the particles or\ncorpuscles comprising compound bodies to be indivisible, or at least\nprobably so. Since Locke\u2019s sympathies clearly lie with the\natomist version, the term \u2018corpuscular hypothesis\u2019 shall\nrefer to that variant throughout this article unless indicated\notherwise. Locke develops central theses of the Essay in\nclose conjunction with the corpuscular hypothesis. The most notable of\nthese is the distinction between real and nominal essences, the former\ndenoting a substance\u2019s internal constitution and the latter\ndenoting the observable properties we use to name or categorize it.\nAlthough Locke develops that distinction in connection with the\nprimary-secondary quality distinction associated with corpuscular\ntheorists, including his mentor, Robert Boyle, it does not follow that\nthe two distinctions are interchangeable. Locke often treats the\nhypothesis with skepticism, and its status and purpose are a source of\ncontroversy.\n\nThis article examines questions connected with the two salient\nfeatures noted, and in connection with the first, it also examines\nLocke\u2019s relationship to Newton, a figure instrumental to the\nchanging conceptions of scientific knowledge. Section 2 addresses\nquestions connected to those conceptions. What does Locke take science\n(scientia) or scientific knowledge to be generally, why does\nhe think that scientia in natural philosophy is beyond the\nreach of human beings, and what characterizes the conception of human\nknowledge that he develops for natural philosophy? Section 3 addresses\nthe question provoked by Locke\u2019s apparently conflicting\ntreatments of the corpuscular hypothesis. Does he accept or defend the\ncorpuscular hypothesis? If not, what is its role in his thought, and\nwhat explains its close connection to key theses of the\nEssay? Since a scholarly debate has arisen about the status\nof the corpuscular hypothesis for Locke, Section 3 reviews some main\npositions in that debate. Section 4 considers the relationship between\nLocke\u2019s thought and Newton\u2019s. All citations of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding are indicated by\n\u2018E\u2019, followed by the book and section numbers.
