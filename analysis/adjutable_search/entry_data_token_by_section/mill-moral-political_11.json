    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Sanction Utilitarianism\n2.9 Sanction Utilitarianism\n\nSo far, Mill\u2019s various claims about duty are largely consistent\nwith direct utilitarianism, and, hence, act utilitarianism. However,\nChapter V of Utilitarianism introduces claims about duty,\njustice, and rights that are hard to square with either.\n\n\nFor the truth is, that the idea of penal sanction, which is the\nessence of law, enters not only into the conception of injustice, but\ninto that of any kind of wrong. We do not call anything wrong unless\nwe mean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some way or\nother for doing it\u2014if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow\ncreatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience.\nThis seems the real turning point of the distinction between morality\nand simple expediency. (V 14)\n\n\nHere Mill defines wrongness and, by implication, duty, not directly in\nterms of the nature of the action or its consequences but indirectly\nin terms of appropriate responses to it. He appears to believe that\none is under an obligation or duty to do something just in case\nfailure to do it is wrong and that an action is wrong just in case\nsome kind of external or internal sanction\u2014punishment, social\ncensure, or self-reproach\u2014ought to be applied to its\nperformance. This test distinguishes duty from expediency (V 14, 15).\nNot all suboptimal or inexpedient acts are wrong, only those to which\none ought to apply some sort of sanction (at least,\nself-reproach).\n\nJustice is a proper part of duty. Justice involves duties that are\nperfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are correlated with rights\n(V 15). An act is just if and only if it is not unjust, and it is\nunjust just in case it is wrong and violates someone\u2019s rights (V\n23). Someone has a right just in case she has a claim that society\nought to protect by force of law or public opinion (V 24).\n\nNotice that these relationships among duty, justice, and rights do not\nyet introduce any utilitarian elements. But Mill does think that\nwhether sanctions ought to be applied to an action\u2014and hence\nwhether it is wrong\u2014and whether society ought to enforce an\nindividual\u2019s claim\u2014and hence whether she has a\nright\u2014both depend upon the utility or expediency of doing so (V\n25). He does not say precisely what standard of expediency he has in\nmind. In particular, he does not say whether the relevant test for\nwhether something is wrong requires that sanctions be optimal or\nmerely beneficial. To fix ideas, let us assume that an action is wrong\nif and only if it is optimal to sanction it.\n\nBecause this account of duty defines the rightness and wrongness of an\nact, not in terms of its utility, as act utilitarianism does, but in\nterms of the utility of applying sanctions to the conduct, it is an\nindirect form of utilitarianism. Because justice is a species of duty,\nit inherits this indirect character (also see Lyons 1994). Because it\nmakes the deontic status of conduct depend upon the utility of\nsanctioning that conduct in some way, we might call this conception of\nduty, justice, and rights sanction utilitarianism. Because\nsanction utilitarianism is a species of indirect utilitarianism, it is\ninconsistent with act utilitarianism. The introduction of indirect\nutilitarian ideas in Chapter V of Utilitarianism into an\naccount of utilitarianism that otherwise looks act utilitarian reveals\na fundamental tension in Mill\u2019s thought about duty.\n2.10 Act vs. Sanction Utilitarianism\n\nGiven Mill\u2019s ambivalence between direct and indirect\nutilitarianism, it is natural to inquire whether one view is more\nplausible than the other. Some of Mill\u2019s claims in Chapter V\nsuggest a possible advantage that sanction utilitarianism might have.\nIn articulating sanction utilitarianism, Mill claims that it allows\nhim to distinguish duty and expediency and claim that not all\ninexpedient acts are wrong; inexpedient acts are only wrong when it is\ngood or optimal to sanction them. This suggests that sanction\nutilitarianism may be preferable to act utilitarianism, because it has\na more plausible account of the relation among different deontic\ncategories.\n\nCommonsense moral thinking recognizes a familiar fourfold deontic\ndistinction.\n\nwrong or forbidden\npermissible\nobligatory\nsupererogatory\n\n\nThe act utilitarian seems unable to account for this fourfold\ndistinction. It implies that I do wrong every time I fail to perform\nthe optimal act, even when these suboptimal acts are very good.\nBecause it makes the optimal obligatory and the suboptimal wrong, it\nappears to expand the domain of the forbidden, collapse the\ndistinction between the permissible and the obligatory, and make no\nroom for the supererogatory. If the optimal is already one\u2019s\nduty, there appears to be no room for the supererogatory. By contrast,\nsanction utilitarianism does not appear to have these problems. It\noffers a distinct account of each category.\n\nWrong or forbidden acts are those whose performance it is optimal\nto blame.\nPermissible acts are those whose performance it is not optimal to\nblame.\nObligatory acts are those whose omission it is optimal to\nblame.\nSupererogatory acts are permissible acts that are especially\nexpedient.\n\n\nIn this way, sanction utilitarianism appears to respect this common\ndeontic categorization and, in particular, to make room for the\nsupererogatory.\n\nHowever, the direct utilitarian can and should distinguish between the\nmoral assessment of an act and the moral assessment of the act of\npraising or blaming that act. Each should be assessed, the direct\nutilitarian claims, by the utility of doing so. But then it is\npossible for there to be wrongdoing (a suboptimal act) that is\nblameless or even praiseworthy. But then the direct utilitarian can\nappeal to the same distinctions among praiseworthiness and\nblameworthiness that the sanction utilitarian appeals to, while\ndenying that her own deontic distinctions track blame and praise. So,\nfor instance, there can be acts that are wrong, because suboptimal,\nthat it would nonetheless be wrong to blame, because this would be\nsuboptimal. If so, it is unclear that sanction utilitarianism enjoys\nany real advantage here over act utilitarianism.\n\nMoreover, sanction utilitarianism appears to have disadvantages that\nact utilitarianism does not. One such problem derives from its\nhybrid structure. Sanction utilitarianism is impurely\nindirect. For while it provides an indirect utilitarian theory of\nduty, the account it provides of when sanctions should be applied to\nconduct is direct\u2014it depends upon the consequences of applying\nsanctions. Sanction utilitarianism provides an indirect utilitarian\naccount of the conditions under which an action\u2014any\naction\u2014is right or wrong. This general criterion is that any\naction is wrong to which one ought to attach sanctions. But imposing\nsanctions is a kind of action, and we can ask whether the imposition\nof a particular sanction would be right or wrong. The general\ncriterion implies that we should answer this question about the\nrightness of applying sanctions in sanction-utilitarians terms,\nnamely, by asking whether it would be right to sanction the failure to\napply sanctions. This introduces a second-order sanction, whose\nrightness we can now ask about. We seem to be off on an infinite\nregress of sanctions. Sanction-utilitarianism avoids the regress\nbecause it provides a direct utilitarian answer to the question when\nto apply the first-order sanction. It says that a sanction should be\napplied iff doing so is optimal. Though this avoids a regress, it\nappears to render sanction utilitarianism internally inconsistent.\n\nAny act is right iff and because it is optimal to apply sanctions\nto its omission (the indirect claim).\nApplying sanctions is right iff and because doing so is optimal\n(the direct claim).\n\n\n(2) is inconsistent with (1).\n\nThe different strands in Mill\u2019s utilitarian conception of duty\nrequire disentangling. In his central exposition of the utilitarian\nstandard in Chapter II, Mill commits himself to act utilitarianism in\nmultiple passages. In that same chapter, he focuses on the felicific\ntendencies of actions and assigns a significant role to rules within\nmoral reasoning, both of which have been taken to commit him to a rule\nutilitarian doctrine. However, these claims are reconcilable with\ndirect utilitarianism and so provide no good reason to depart from a\ntraditional act utilitarian reading of that chapter. But in Chapter V\nMill does introduce indirect utilitarian ideas in the doctrine of\nsanction utilitarianism. It is hard to reconcile these direct and\nindirect elements in Mill\u2019s conception of duty.\n2.11 The Proof of Utility\n\nWe have focused so far on understanding Mill\u2019s version of\nutilitarianism, especially his conceptions of happiness and duty. Now\nwe should consider his justification of utilitarianism, which he\noffers in his discussion of the \u201cproof\u201d of the principle\nof utility in Chapter IV. Mill claims that the utilitarian must claim\nthat happiness is the one and only thing desirable in itself (IV 2).\nHe claims that the only proof of desirability is desire and proceeds\nto argue that happiness is the one and only thing desired. He argues\nthat a person does desire his own happiness for its own sake and that,\ntherefore, happiness as such is desired by and desirable for its own\nsake for humanity as a whole (\u201cThe aggregate of all\npersons\u201d) (IV 3). He then turns to defend the claim that\nhappiness is the only thing desirable in itself, by arguing that\napparent counterexamples (e.g., desires for virtue for its own sake)\nare not inconsistent with his claim (IV 5\u20138).\n\nOne traditional reconstruction of Mill\u2019s proof might look\nsomething like this.\n\nUtilitarianism is true iff happiness is the one and only thing\ndesirable for its own sake (and not for the sake of something\nelse).\nThe only proof of desirability is desire.\nEach person desires his own happiness for its own sake (and not\nfor the sake of something else).\nHence, happiness, as such, is desired for its own sake (and not\nfor the sake of something else) from the point of view of humanity (=\nthe aggregate of persons).\nHence, happiness, as such, is desirable for its own sake (and not\nfor the sake of something else).\nHappiness is the only thing desired for its own sake (and not for\nthe sake of something else). Other things\u2014such as virtue,\nhealth, music, money, and power\u2014can come to be desired for their\nown sakes, but then they are desired as parts of happiness.\nHence, happiness is the only thing desirable for its own sake (and\nnot for the sake of something else).\nHence, utilitarianism is true.\n\n\nThe proof has, at least in some quarters, threatened Mill\u2019s\nreputation as a careful philosopher. Here is a partial list of\nconcerns about Mill\u2019s argument, as traditionally conceived.\n\n(1) is plausible only if \u201cdesirable\u201d means worthy of\nbeing desired, not if it means capable of being desired. But (2) is\nmost plausible if \u201cdesirable\u201d means capable of being\ndesired (see (iii) below). But then there is a real worry that the\nargument trades on a tacit equivocation between these two different\nsenses of \u201cdesirable\u201d and that the argument is, as a\nresult, invalid.\nEven so, (1) is false. Even if happiness were the one and only\nthing desirable for its own sake, this would establish only a claim\nabout the good or \u201cends.\u201d It is not a claim about duty or\nright action. Utilitarianism not only claims that the good is human\nhappiness but goes on to define the right in terms of promoting the\ngood. The second claim does not follow from the first.\nFor the argument to be valid, \u201cdesirability\u201d in\npremise (2) must mean worthy of being desired (as it does in premise\n(1)). But then (2) is false. Desire is not proof of desirability.\nPeople can and do have mistaken desires about what is good. Indeed, if\nMill is either a hedonist or a perfectionist he must think that people\ncan and do have desires that fail to track the good.\nIt is not clear that (3) is true. It seems as if masochists or\nselfless altruists might fail to desire their own happiness for its\nown sake.\n(4) may be incoherent and certainly does not follow from (3). It\nis not clear that aggregates of persons have desires. Perhaps under\nspecial circumstances groups of people might form a corporate agent or\nperson. But aggregates of persons, as such, are not persons and do not\nhave desires. Even if they did, it is doubtful that one could infer\nwhat the aggregate desires from facts about what its members desire.\nThat would involve a compositional fallacy.\n(5) is presumably equivalent to the claim that happiness is good.\nBut is it good simpliciter or good for the aggregate? The analogy\nbetween individuals and groups would suggest that happiness should be\na good for the aggregate. But presumably the intended conclusion\nrequires that happiness be good simpliciter.\nIt is not clear how to understand (6). One would think that the\naim is to make claims that parallel (4) and (5). But then (6) needs to\nbe understood as making another claim about aggregate psychology. And\nthis raises some of the earlier questions about aggregate psychology.\nHowever, much of the discussion in IV 5\u20138 seems to be about\nindividual psychology. Mill seems to be saying that insofar as\nindividuals do have intrinsic desires for things other than their own\nhappiness the objects of intrinsic desire are desired as parts of\ntheir own happiness. Perhaps this is Mill\u2019s initial claim from\nwhich he then hopes to infer, as he did from (3)\u2013(4), that the\ngeneral happiness is the only thing desired by the aggregate for its\nown sake (and not for the sake of something else). This inference\nwould, of course, give rise to the same sort of worries we raised\nabout the inference from (3)\u2013(4). In particular, we might doubt\nthat aggregates of persons have any aims, much less ultimate aims. And\neven if we conceded that they did, it is not clear that we could infer\nfacts about the desires of aggregates from facts about the desires of\nits members. That, we said, would seem to involve a compositional\nfallacy.\nEven if we accepted this defense of (5) and (7), this would only\nestablish that happiness as such was the only thing desirable or good\nfor the aggregate. It looks like we could have parallel claims about\nthe agent\u2019s own happiness being the only thing desirable or good\nfor the individual. But this might seem to imply that while the\naggregate should pursue or promote the general happiness individuals\nshould pursue or promote their own happiness. That would not be a\ndefense of utilitarianism.\n\n\nThese are all serious worries about Mill\u2019s proof, as\ntraditionally conceived. These objections seem so serious and so\nobvious that they should make us wonder if there is a more plausible\ninterpretation of his proof.\n\nFor one thing, Mill need not confuse desire and desirability. He\nrecognizes that they are distinct, but says that desire is our only\nproof of desirability (IV 3). In saying this, he need not presuppose\nthat desiring something confers value on (obtaining) it. Our desires\noften reflect value judgments we make, explicitly or implicitly. If\nso, our desires will be evidence of what we regard as valuable, and\nour reflectively acceptable desires may provide our best defeasible\ntest of what things are objectively valuable.\n\nMill first applies this test to what each of us desires for her own\nsake. His answer is that what each of us desires for her own sake is\nhappiness (IV 3). We needn\u2019t interpret Mill as endorsing\npsychological egoism at this point. Rather, he is saying when each of\nus does focus on her own ends or sake, we find that each cares about\nher own happiness. Another way to put Mill\u2019s point is that\nprudential concern focuses on the agent\u2019s happiness.\n\nMill goes on to say that just as each person\u2019s own happiness is\na good to that person, so too happiness, as such, is a good to the\naggregate of persons. But we need not suppose that Mill is attributing\na psychology, much less an egoist psychology, to humanity as a group.\nInstead, we can read Mill as claiming that just as the agent\u2019s\nown happiness is the object of prudential concern, so too happiness as\nsuch is the proper object of disinterested or impartial concern.\n\nOn this reading, Mill is not trying to derive utilitarianism from\negoism (see Hall 1949). Rather, he is assuming that the moral point of\nview is impartial in a way that prudence is not. Just as prudence aims\nat the agent\u2019s own happiness, so too, Mill thinks, morality,\nwhich is impartial, aims at happiness as such. On this reading, the\nstructure of Mill\u2019s proof looks something like this.\n\nPrudence is partial.\nBecause prudence is partial, it aims at the agent\u2019s own\nhappiness.\nMorality, by contrast, is impartial.\nBecause morality is impartial, it aims at happiness as such.\nIf the moral point of view aims at happiness as such, then it is\nthe moral duty of each to promote happiness.\nHence, utilitarianism is true.\n\n\nIf this is the right way to understand Mill\u2019s proof, then his\njustification of utilitarianism consists in assuming that the moral\npoint of view is impartial and claiming that utilitarianism is the\nright way to understand impartiality. Morality is impartial, and\nimpartiality requires taking everyone\u2019s interests into\naccount\u2014and not just those of some select few\u2014and weighing\nthem equally\u2014and not with a thumb in the scales for some select\nfew. Indeed, later, in Chapter V, Mill identifies impartiality and its\nprogressive demands with both justice and morality.\n\n\nIt [impartiality] is involved in the very meaning of Utility, or the\nGreatest-Happiness Principle. That principle is a mere form of words\nwithout rational signification, unless one person\u2019s happiness,\nsupposed equal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is\ncounted for exactly as much as another\u2019s. Those conditions being\nsupplied, Bentham\u2019s dictum \u2018everybody to count for one,\nnobody for more than one,\u2019 might be written under the principle\nof utility as an explanatory commentary. The equal claim of everybody\nto happiness in the estimation of the moralist and the legislator\ninvolves an equal claim to all the means of happiness \u2026. And\nhence all social inequalities which have ceased to be considered\nexpedient, assume the character not of simple inexpediency, but of\ninjustice. The entire history of social improvement has been a series\nof transitions, by which one custom or institution after another, from\nbeing supposed a primary necessity of social existence, has passed\ninto the rank of universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it\nhas been with the distinctions of slaves and freemen, nobles and\nserfs, patricians and plebeians; and so it will be, and in part\nalready is, with the aristocracies of colour, race, and sex. (V\n36)\n\n\nHere we see Mill identifying utilitarian impartiality with the demands\nof justice and morality itself (also see Crisp 1997: 79\u201380).\n\nOne might wonder if utilitarianism is the only or the best way to\nunderstand impartiality. Indeed, this is one way of understanding now\nfamiliar worries about the implications of utilitarianism for issues\nof distributive justice and individual rights. But this reading of the\nproof has the virtue of identifying Mill\u2019s defense of\nutilitarianism with the feature of it that made it a progressive\ninfluence historically.\n2.12 The Sanctions of Utility\n\nIn Chapter III of Utilitarianism Mill addresses the question\nof the ultimate sanction of the principle of utility. He understands\nthis alternately as a question about \u201cthe motives to obey\nit\u201d and the \u201csource of its obligation \u2026 [or]\nbinding force\u201d (III 1). Mill recognizes a potential worry about\nthe sanctions of utilitarianism that apparently has its source in\nprudence or self-interest.\n\n\nHe [an agent] says to himself, I feel that I am bound not to rob or\nmurder, betray or deceive; but why am I bound to promote the general\nhappiness? If my own happiness lies in something else, why may I not\ngive that the preference? (III 1)\n\n\nBut this worry about potential conflicts between the agent\u2019s own\ninterests and utilitarian moral demands seems to arise for any\nconception of morality that recognizes other-regarding moral demands.\nFor this reason, Mill seems to think that it poses no special problem\nfor utilitarianism (III 1, 2, 3, 6).\n\nIs Mill right that there is no special threat to utilitarianism here?\nOne might wonder whether utilitarianism makes greater demands on\nagents than other moral theories. Contemporary writers have argued\nthat utilitarianism seems to be potentially very demanding, much more\nso than commonsense morality. For instance, reformist utilitarians,\nsuch as Peter Singer (1972), have argued that utilitarianism entails\nextensive duties of mutual aid that would call for significant changes\nin the lifestyles of all those who are even moderately well off. And\ncritics of utilitarianism have treated the demandingness of\nutilitarianism as one of its principal flaws. Rawls (1971) has argued\nthat the sort of interpersonal sacrifice that utilitarianism requires\nviolates the strains of commitment in a well-ordered society. And\nBernard Williams (1973) has argued that the demandingness of\nutilitarianism threatens the sort of personal projects and partial\nrelationships that help give our lives meaning. The common complaint\nhere is that utilitarianism\u2019s demands threaten to offend against\na requirement of psychological realism, according to which\nthe demands of an acceptable moral theory must be ones that can be\nincorporated into a reasonable and satisfying life plan.\n\nThis worry about the demands of utilitarianism is not easy to assess.\nOne might wonder how to interpret and whether to accept the\npsychological realist constraint. If the constraint is relative to\npeople\u2019s actual psychologies, then it represents a potentially\nconservative constraint on moral theorizing that one might well\nreject. If the constraint is relative to possible or ideal psychology,\nthen it is not clear that even a highly revisionary moral theory need\nflout the constraint. Then there is a question about how demanding or\nrevisionary utilitarianism actually is. Mill and Sidgwick thought that\nour knowledge of others and our causal powers to do good were limited\nto those near and dear and other associates with whom we have regular\ncontact, with the result that as individuals we do better overall by\nfocusing our energies and actions on associates of one kind or\nanother, rather than the world at large (U II 19; Sidgwick,\nMethods 361\u201369). On this view, utilitarianism can\naccommodate the sort of special obligations and personal concerns to\nwhich the critics of utilitarianism appeal. But it is arguable that\neven if this sort of utilitarian accommodation was tenable in\nnineteenth century Britain, technological development and\nglobalization have rendered utilitarian demands more revisionary. Our\ninformation about others and our causal reach are not limited as they\nonce were. Given the high benefit-to-cost ratio of many modern relief\nagencies, it is hard to resist something like Singer\u2019s\nconclusions about the reformist demands of utilitarianism. So even if\nMill was right to think that the motivational demands of\nutilitarianism were not so different from those of other moral\ntheories at the time he wrote, that claim might need to be reassessed\ntoday.\n3. Mill\u2019s Liberalism\n\nMill\u2019s On Liberty is the most influential statement of\nhis liberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new\nthreats to liberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional\nsocieties in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an\n aristocracy).[1]\n Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by\nbenevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when\nrulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in\ntheir own interests, rather than the interests of the governed. In\nparticular, they will restrict the liberties of their subjects in ways\nthat benefit themselves, rather than the ruled. It was these\ntraditional threats to liberty that the democratic reforms of the\nPhilosophical Radicals were meant to address. But Mill thinks that\nthese traditional threats to liberty are not the only ones to worry\nabout. He makes clear that democracies contain their own threats to\nliberty\u2014this is the tyranny, not of the one or the few, but of\nthe majority (OL I 1\u20135).  Mill sets out to articulate\nthe principles that should regulate how governments and societies,\nwhether democratic or not, can restrict individual liberties (I\n6).\n3.1 Liberal Principles and the Categorical Approach\n\nIn an early and famous passage Mill conceives of liberalism in terms\nof \u201cone very simple principle.\u201d\n\n\nThe object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as\nentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means\nused be physical force in the form of legal penalties or the moral\ncoercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for\nwhich mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in\ninterfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is\nself-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be\nrightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against\nhis will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical\nor moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be\ncompelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so,\nbecause it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others,\nto do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for\nremonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or\nentreating him, but not for compelling him or visiting him with any\nevil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which\nit is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to\nsomeone else. The only part of the conduct of anyone for which he is\namenable to society is that which concerns others. In the part which\nmerely concerns himself, his independence, is, of right, absolute.\nOver himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\n(I 9)\n\n\nIn this passage, Mill distinguishes paternalistic and moralistic\nrestrictions of liberty from restrictions of liberty based upon the\nharm principle and claims that the harm prevention is the sole\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberties.\n\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is\npaternalistic if it is done for B\u2019s own\nbenefit.\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is\nmoralistic if it is done to ensure that B acts morally or not\nimmorally.\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is an\napplication of the harm principle if it is done to prevent\nharm to someone other than B.\n\n\nLater, Mill distinguishes between genuine harm and mere\noffense. In order to satisfy the harm principle, an action must\nviolate or risk violation of those important interests of others in\nwhich they have a right (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10; IV 12; V 5).\n\nThese distinctions allow Mill to defend a categorical\napproach to liberal rights. To decide whether an\nindividual\u2019s liberty ought to be protected, we must ascertain to\nwhich category the potential restriction of liberty belongs: offense,\nmoralism, paternalism, and harm prevention. Mill seems to permit or\nforbid restrictions on liberty by category, claiming that the only\nrestrictions that are permissible involve harm prevention. Of course,\na given regulation might fall under more than one category. Many\nprovisions of the criminal law, such as prohibitions on murder and\nassault, might be designed both to enforce fundamental moral\nprovisions and to prevent harm to others. Mill does not object to\nmoralistic or paternalistic legislation that can also be defended by\nappeal to the harm principle. Rather, the objection is to restrictions\nthat can only be justified in these ways and cannot be justified by\nappeal to harm prevention.\n\nHarm prevention is a necessary but not sufficient ground for\nrestricting individual liberties. Harm prevention is sufficient to\nestablish a pro tanto case for regulation (I 11), but whether\nregulation is all things considered appropriate depends on a\nutilitarian calculation of whether the benefits of regulation exceed\nits costs.\n\n\nAs soon as any part of a person\u2019s conduct affects prejudicially\nthe interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the\nquestion whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by\ninterfering with it, becomes open to discussion. (IV 3)\n\n\nThis means that the harm principle is not in fact Mill\u2019s only\nprinciple, because we cannot decide whether regulations that would\nprevent harm should be adopted without appealing to the principle of\nutility. But even if harm prevention is not sufficient to justify\nrestricting liberty, Mill does appear to claim that it is\nnecessary.\n\nSometimes Mill suggests that the harm principle is equivalent to\nletting society restrict other-regarding conduct (I 11; IV 2). On this\nview, conduct can be divided into self-regarding and other-regarding\nconduct. Regulation of the former is paternalistic, and regulation of\nthe latter is an application of the harm principle. So on this view it\nis never permissible to regulate purely self-regarding conduct and\nalways permissible to regulate other-regarding conflict. But, as Mill\nhimself concedes, very little conduct is purely self-regarding (IV 8).\nSome other-regarding conduct causes mere offense, not genuine harm (IV\n3; IV 12). So Mill cannot equate harmful behavior and other-regarding\nbehavior and cannot think that all other-regarding behavior may be\nregulated.\n\nIt is generally thought that by applying this categorical approach to\nliberty and its permissible restrictions Mill is led to offer a fairly\nextensive defense of individual liberties against interference by the\nstate and society. In particular, it is sometimes thought that Mill\nrecognizes a large sphere of conduct which it is impermissible for the\nstate to regulate. We might characterize this sphere of protected\nliberties as Mill\u2019s conception of liberal rights. On\nthis reading, Mill is deriving his conception of liberal rights from a\nprior commitment to the categorical approach and, in particular, to\nthe harm principle (see Jacobson 2000 for an alternative reading).\n3.2 Categories, Rights, and Utility\n\nThere is an apparent tension between Mill\u2019s commitment to a\ncategorical approach to basic liberties and his defense of\nutilitarianism. Utilitarianism treats the good as prior to and\nindependent of the right or duty\u2014defining duty as the promotion\nof good consequences. Perhaps certain kinds of actions tend to be good\nor bad, but, according to direct utilitarianism, the moral quality of\na particular action depends on its own consequences. By contrast, the\ndeontological and natural rights traditions treat duty or the right as\nprior to and independent of the good. In particular, deontologists\nbelieve that it is not always one\u2019s duty to promote good\nconsequences. Sometimes one has a duty to do an act that is\nsuboptimal, and sometimes it is wrong to do the optimal act.\nDeontologists recognize moral constraints on pursuing the\ngood. These constraints usually take the form of categorical\nrules to perform or refrain from certain sorts of actions (e.g.,\nto keep promises or to refrain from lying), regardless of the\nconsequences. A special case of this perceived conflict between\ncategorical rules and utility is the perceived tension between utility\nand rights. For, on a common view, individual rights just are\na special case of categorical rules. Individual rights, such as rights\nto liberties or to freedom from harm, are interpreted as\n\u201ctrumps\u201d or \u201cside constraints\u201d on the pursuit\nof good consequences (Dworkin 1977: xi, 184\u2013205; Nozick 1974:\n28\u201335).\n\nThe apparent conflict between utility and rights poses an interesting\ntest for Mill, because he wants to defend liberal rights that have\nutilitarian foundations.\n\n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing\nindependent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense,\ngrounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\n(OL I 11)\n\n\nWe need to ask if Mill is able to reconcile his defense of utility and\nliberty without compromising either his utilitarianism or his defense\nof a right to liberties.\n3.3 Freedom of Expression\n\nMill begins his defense of basic liberties with a discussion of\nfreedom of expression. He thinks that there is general agreement on\nthe importance of free speech and that, once the grounds for free\nspeech are understood, this agreement can be exploited to support a\nmore general defense of individual liberties (I 16; III 1). So his\ndefense of expressive liberties is important not only in its own right\nbut also insofar as it lays the foundation of his liberal\nprinciples.\n\nMill\u2019s discussion of censorship in Chapter II focuses on\ncensorship whose aim is to suppress false or immoral opinion (II\n1\u20132). He mentions four reasons for maintaining free speech and\nopposing censorship.\n\nA censored opinion might be true (II 1\u201320, 41).\nEven if literally false, a censored opinion might contain part of\nthe truth (II 34\u201339, 42).\nEven if wholly false, a censored opinion would prevent true\nopinions from becoming dogma (II 1\u20132, 6, 7, 22\u201323,\n43).\nAs a dogma, an unchallenged opinion will lose its meaning (II 26,\n43).\n\n\nIt is natural to group these four considerations into two main kinds:\nthe first two invoke a truth-tracking defense of expressive liberties,\nwhile the second two appeal to a distinctive kind of value that free\ndiscussion is supposed to have.\n3.3.1 The Truth-Tracking Rationale\n\nThe first two claims represent freedom of expression as instrumentally\nvaluable; it is valuable, not in itself, but as the most reliable\nmeans of producing something else that Mill assumes is valuable\n(either extrinsically or intrinsically), namely, true belief. It is\nnot hard to see how true beliefs would possess at least instrumental\nvalue, if only because our actions, plans, and reasoning are likely to\nbe more successful when based on true beliefs. Of course, the most\nreliable means of promoting true belief would be to believe\neverything. But that would bring a great deal of false belief along\ntoo. A more plausible goal to promote would be something like the\nratio of true belief to false belief. Freedom of expression might then\nbe defended as a more reliable policy for promoting the ratio of true\nbelief to false belief than a policy of censorship. This rationale for\nfreedom of expression is echoed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in\nhis famous dissent in Abrams v. United States (1919) when he\nclaims that the best test of truth is free trade in the marketplace of\nideas.\n\nNotice that this instrumental defense of freedom of expression does\nnot require the mistaken assumption that the censor must assume his\nown infallibility (OL II 3). The censor can recognize that he\nmight be mistaken, but insist that he must act on the best available\nevidence about what is true. Mill can reply that proper\nrecognition of one's own fallibility should typically lead one to keep\ndiscussion open and not foreclose discussion of possibilities that\nseem improbable.\n\nThis instrumental rationale may justify freedom of expression in\npreference to a policy of censorship whenever the censor finds the\nbeliefs in question implausible or offensive. But it does not justify\nfreedom of expression in preference to more conservative forms of\ncensorship. If the question is what policies are likely to increase\nthe ratio of true to false belief, we would seem to be justified in\ncensoring opinions for whose falsity there is especially clear,\ncompelling, and consistent or stable evidence. We would be on good\nground in censoring flat-earthers (both literal and figurative).\n\nAnother way to see the weakness of the truth-tracking justification of\nfreedom of expression is to notice that this instrumental defense of\nfreedom of expression cannot explain what is wrong with censorship\nthat is successful in truth-tracking terms. Suppose we lived in a\nsociety of the sort Plato imagines in the Republic in which\ncognitive capacities are distributed unequally between rulers and\ncitizens and in which maximally knowledgeable and reliable\ncensors\u2014call them \u201cphilosopher kings\u201d\u2014censor\nall and only false beliefs. The truth-tracking argument would provide\nno argument against censorship in such circumstances. This shows that\nthe truth-tracking argument condemns only unsuccessful or\nincompetent censorship. For some, this may be the biggest\nworry about censorship. But many would have residual worries about\nsuccessful or competent censorship. They would\nobject to censorship, even by philosopher-kings. Answering this worry\nrequires a more robust defense of expressive liberties.\n3.3.2 The Deliberative Rationale\n\nThe resources for a more robust defense of freedom of expression can\nbe found in Mill\u2019s claim that it is needed to keep true beliefs\nfrom becoming dogmatic, because this reason for valuing freedom is\nintended to rebut the case for censorship even on the assumption that\nall and only false beliefs would be censored (II 2, 21).\n\nMill\u2019s claim that the value of freedom of expression lies in\nkeeping true beliefs from becoming dogmatic reflects his view that\nfreedoms of thought and discussion are necessary for fulfilling our\nnatures as progressive beings (OL II 20). For instance, Mill\nappeals to a familiar distinction between true belief, on the\none hand, and knowledge, understood as something like\njustified true belief, on the other hand (II 22; cf. Scanlon\n1972; Ten 1980: 126\u201328). Progressive beings seek knowledge or\njustified true belief, and not simply true belief. Whereas the mere\npossession of true beliefs need not exercise one\u2019s deliberative\ncapacities, because they might be the product of indoctrination, their\njustification would. One exercises deliberative capacities in the\njustification of one\u2019s beliefs and actions that is required for\ntheoretical and practical knowledge. This is because justification\ninvolves comparison of, and deliberation among, alternatives (II 6, 7,\n8, 22\u201323, 43). Freedoms of thought and discussion are essential\nto the justification of one\u2019s beliefs and actions, because\nindividuals are not cognitively self-sufficient (II 38, 39; III 1).\nSharing thought and discussion with others, especially about important\nmatters, improves one\u2019s deliberations. It enlarges the menu of\noptions, by identifying new options worth consideration, and helps one\nbetter assess the merits of these options, by forcing on one\u2019s\nattention new considerations and arguments about the comparative\nmerits of the options. In these ways, open and vigorous discussion\nwith diverse interlocutors improves the quality of one\u2019s\ndeliberations. If so, censorship, even of false belief, can rob both\nthose whose speech is suppressed and their audience of resources that\nthey need to justify their beliefs and actions (II 1).\n\nThis deliberative rationale can explain why it is often wrong to\ncensor even false beliefs. In this way, Mill\u2019s defense of\nexpressive liberties that relies on his perfectionist appeal to\ndeliberative values is a more robust defense than the one provided by\nhis truth-tracking arguments alone.\n3.4 A Perfectionist Defense of Basic Liberties\n\nThough important in its own right, Mill\u2019s defense of freedom of\nthought and discussion provides the resources for a more general\ndefense of basic liberties of thought and action that Mill offers in\nthe balance of On Liberty. A good human life is one that\nexercises one\u2019s higher capacities (I 11, 20; III 1\u201310); a\nperson\u2019s higher capacities include her deliberative capacities,\nin particular, capacities to form, revise, assess, select, and\nimplement her own plan of life. This kind of self-government requires\nboth positive and negative conditions. Among the positive conditions\nit requires is an education that develops deliberative competence by\nproviding understanding of different historical periods and social\npossibilities, developing cultural and aesthetic sensibilities,\ndeveloping skills essential for critical reasoning and assessment, and\ncultivating habits of intellectual curiosity, modesty, and\nopen-mindedness (V 12\u201315). Among the negative conditions that\nself-government requires are various liberties of thought and action.\nIf the choice and pursuit of projects and plans is to be deliberate,\nit must be informed as to the alternatives and their grounds, and this\nrequires intellectual freedoms of speech, association, and press that\nexpand the menu of deliberative options and allow for the vivid\nrepresentation of the comparative merits of options on that menu. If\nthere is to be choice and implementation of choices, there must be\nliberties of action such as freedom of association, freedom of\nworship, and freedom to choose one\u2019s occupation.\n\nIndeed, liberties of thought and action are importantly related. This\nis apparent in the pre-eminent value Mill assigns to diversity and\nexperimentation in life-style. Indeed, in his Autobiography\nMill describes this as the central truth of On Liberty:\n\n\nThe importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of\ncharacter, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself\nin innumerable and conflicting directions. (Autobiography\n259)\n\n\nDiversity and experimentation in life-style are important not only\ninsofar as they are expressions of self-government but also insofar as\nthey enhance self-government. For experimentation and diversity of\nlife-style expand the deliberative menu and bring out more clearly the\nnature and merits of options on the menu (OL II 23, 38; III\n1).\n3.5 Limits on Liberty\n\nDespite this robust rationale for liberties of thought and action, it\nis also important to see that Mill is not treating liberty as an\nintrinsic good or endorsing an unqualified right to liberty.\n\nFirst, we should note that Mill does not defend liberty per\nse, but only certain basic liberties. His defense\nfocuses on three basic categories of liberty (I 12).\n\nLiberties of conscience and expression\nLiberties of tastes, pursuits, and life-plans\nLiberties of association\n\n\nThough these liberties evidently include quite a bit, there is no\nsuggestion here that any and all liberty deserves protection. Why not?\nInsofar as Mill defends individual liberties by appeal to deliberative\nvalues, he can distinguish the importance of different liberties in\nterms of their role in practical deliberation. A central part of\npractical deliberation is forming ideals and regulating one\u2019s\nactions and plans in accordance with these ideals. But some liberties\nseem more central than others to the selection of personal ideals. For\ninstance, it seems plausible that liberties of speech, association,\nworship, and choice of profession are more important than liberties to\ndrive in either direction on streets designated as one-way, liberties\nnot to wear seat belts, or liberties to dispose of one\u2019s gross\nincome as one pleases, because restrictions on the former seem to\ninterfere more than restrictions on the latter with deliberations and\nchoices about what sort of person to be.\n\nSecond, even the exercise of basic liberties is limited by the harm\nprinciple, which justifies restricting liberty to prevent harm to\nothers. Even expressive liberties can be restricted when their\nexercise poses a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to others.\n\n\n[E]ven opinions lose their immunity when the circumstances in which\nthey are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a\npositive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn\ndealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery,\nought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but\nmay justifiably incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited\nmob assembled before the house of a corn dealer, or when handed about\namong the same mob in the form of a placard. (III 1)\n\n\nThere are interesting questions about the correct interpretation of\nthe harm principle, which we will examine later. But Mill\u2019s\ncommitment to some version of the harm principle as a ground for\nrestricting liberty is hard to dispute.\n\nThird, it is important to be clear about how Mill values basic\nliberties. To account for the robust character of his perfectionist\nargument, it is tempting to suppose that Mill thinks these basic\nliberties are themselves important intrinsic goods (see Berger 1984:\n41, 50, 199, 231\u201332; Bogen and Farrell 1978: 325\u201328). But\nin Mill\u2019s introductory remarks he insists that his liberal\nprinciples do not apply to individuals who do not have a suitably\ndeveloped normative competence (I 10). So, for instance, the\nprohibition on paternalism does not extend to children with immature\ndeliberative faculties or to adults with very limited normative\ncompetence, whether due to congenital defects or social circumstance.\nSuch restrictions on the scope of Mill\u2019s principles make little\nsense if basic liberties are dominant intrinsic goods, for then it\nshould always be valuable to accord people liberties\u2014a claim\nthat Mill denies. Instead, Mill claims that these liberties have value\nonly when various necessary conditions for the exercise of\ndeliberative capacities\u2014in particular, sufficient rational\ndevelopment or normative competence\u2014are in place.\n3.6 The Harm Principle\n\nWith a better understanding of the rationale and limits of\nMill\u2019s liberal principles, we can take a closer look at the\ndetails of his categorical approach, including its\ncenterpiece\u2014the harm principle.\n\nFirst, recall that Mill distinguishes between harm and\nmere offense. Not every unwelcome consequence for others\ncounts as a harm. Offenses tend to be comparatively minor and\nephemeral. To constitute a harm, an action must be injurious or set\nback important interests of particular people, interests in which they\nhave rights (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). Whereas Mill appears to\nreject the regulation of mere offense, the harm principle appears to\nbe the one justification he recognizes for restricting liberty.\n\nSecond, Mill envisions that the harm principle is something that we\ncan apply prospectively to prevent someone from acting in certain ways\nand causing harm. In many cases all we could reasonably know is that a\ngiven action risks harm. Fortunately, this seems to be all\nthat Mill requires (IV 10). There are interesting and important\nquestions about what threshold of risk must be met for purposes of the\nharm principle, which Mill does not address. Presumably, the threshold\nshould vary inversely with the magnitude of the harm risked, so that\nthe probability of harm required to justify regulation is lower the\ngreater the harm risked.\n\nThird, Mill wants the harm principle to have wide scope. He\ninsists that the harm principle regulates more than relations between\ngovernment and individuals. Its application should include the family,\nin particular, relationships between husbands and wives and parents\nand children (V 12). Here, he prefigures some claims he will develop\nin The Subjection of Women (discussed below).\n\nFourth, though Mill often focuses simply on harm, it appears that his\nreal focus is on non-consensual harm (I 2; see Saunders\n2016). He endorses the maxim volenti non fit injuria, which\nhe glosses in Utilitarianism as the doctrine that \u201cthat\nis not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is\nsupposed to be hurt by it\u201d (U V 28). It is not that one\ncannot be hurt by something one has consented to or freely risked.\nRather, when one has knowingly and willing risked something harmful,\none cannot legitimately complain when that harm comes home to roost.\nHaving my nose broken surely counts as a harm, but if you broke my\nnose in a boxing match, I cannot fairly complain about the harm,\nbecause I consented to the risk.\n\nDoes Mill really treat the harm principle as the sole legitimate basis\nfor restricting the liberties of individuals? As we have seen, Mill\ncannot think that harm prevention is sufficient to justify restricting\nliberty.\n\n\nAs soon as any part of a person\u2019s conduct affects prejudicially\nthe interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the\nquestion whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by\ninterfering with it, becomes open to discussion. (OL IV\n3)\n\n\nLater, Mill makes clear that harm prevention is necessary but not\nsufficient to justify restrictions on liberty.\n\n\n[I]t must by no means be supposed, because damage, or probability of\ndamage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the interference\nof society, that therefore it always does justify such interference.\n(V 3)\n\n\nThese claims demonstrate that Mill is not committed to a simple\nversion of the sufficiency of harm for restrictions on liberty.\nHowever, these claims are compatible with Mill endorsing a weaker\nversion of sufficiency.\n\n\nIf anyone does an act hurtful to others, there is a prima\nfacie case for punishing him by law or, where legal penalties are\nnot safely applicable, by general disapprobation. (I 11)\n\n\nThis suggests that Mill\u2019s position is that causing harm is\nalways pro tanto reason\u2014a non-negligible\nreason\u2014to regulate the action, but nonetheless a reason that\nmight be outweighed by countervailing reasons not to regulate. If the\nregulation is more harmful than the behavior in question, it may be\nbest not to regulate, despite the pro tanto case for\nregulation. This suggests that we should distinguish stronger and\nweaker versions of the idea that harm is sufficient to justify\nregulation.\n\nWeak Sufficiency: Harm to others is a pro tanto\njustification of regulation.\nStrong Sufficiency: Harm to others is a\nconclusive justification of regulation.\n\n\nOnce we distinguish these options, there is a pretty compelling case\nfor thinking that Mill rejects strong sufficiency but embraces weak\nsufficiency.\n\nBut notice that if Mill rejects strong sufficiency then this\ncompromises his one very simple principle. For only strong sufficiency\nshows that the harm principle is a complete guide to the regulation of\nliberty, telling us both when regulation is impermissible and when it\nis required. Even weak sufficiency implies that the harm principle\nmust be supplemented with some other principle, such as the\nutilitarian principle, in order to determine if regulation is\npermissible, much less required. Mill\u2019s doubts about strong\nsufficiency imply that his own conception of liberal rights requires\nmore than the harm principle.\n\nIn rejecting strong sufficiency, Mill claims that actions that cause\nlosses in a fair competition should not be regulated (V 3\u20134).\nThis case would fall within his \u201cfree-trade\u201d exception,\nwhich limits the scope of the liberty principle (V 4). Unfortunately,\nMill is not entirely clear about the basis for the free-trade\nexception. After all, losses, even in a fair competition, can be\nharmful. If I have a successful business selling widgets and then you\nmove into the area selling widgets at a big discount and drive me out\nof business, forcing me into bankruptcy, I suffer a significant loss,\nmaking me worse off than I would otherwise have been.\n\nIf Mill accepts weak, rather than strong, sufficiency, then he might\nclaim that though there is a reason to regulate harmful economic\ncompetition the costs of interfering with free markets are too great.\nHowever, this seems not be Mill\u2019s preferred response. His\nofficial position seems to be that the harm principle should not be\napplied to such economic harms (IV 4). It is hard to see why Mill\nembraces this sort of free-trade exception. A different and better\nreply would not suspend the operation of the harm principle in such\ncases but rather claim that such losses should not be understood as\nharms, in the relevant sense. Mill might make either of two related\narguments for not treating such losses as harms. First, he might\ninvoke the volenti principle and insist that the harm\nprinciple targets only non-consensual harms. He could then argue that\nin a market economy that ensures fair terms of cooperation economic\nlosses of the sort described are freely risked and so consensual, in\nthe relevant sense. Second, Mill can and does claim that competitive\nlosses are not harms, because they do not deprive economic actors of\nsomething to which they have a right (OL V 3). Recall that\nMill says that a harm involves damage to an interest to which a person\nhas a right (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). You may beat me out in a\nfair competition for a job. But I don\u2019t seem to have a right to\nthe job. Instead, what I have is a right of fair opportunity to\ncompete for the job.\n\nIs harm necessary to justify regulation? Though some of Mill\u2019s\npronouncements suggest that causing harm is a necessary condition of\nrestricting liberty, closer inspection suggests that Mill countenances\nvarious restrictions on individual liberty that appear designed to\nbenefit others, rather than prevent harm. Let\u2019s focus on two\nmain kinds of apparent exceptions to the necessity thesis: (1)\nenforceable duties to others that benefit them, such as the duty to\ngive evidence in court and Good Samaritan duties (I 11) and (2)\nenforceable duties to contribute one\u2019s fair share to the\nprovision of various kinds of public goods (IV 3), including the\ncommon defense (OL I 11; PPE V.viii.1), community\ninfrastructure (PPE V.viii.1; CRG 538, 541),\nmandatory education (OL V 12\u201314; PPE\nII.xiii.3, V.xi.8; CRG 467\u201370), and state support for\nthe arts (PPE V.xi.15). These two sorts of exception present\nsomewhat different issues.\n\nIn discussing enforceable duties to give evidence or Samaritan aid,\nMill claims that the failure to confer benefits constitutes harm. But\nit is not in general true that the failure to provide benefits always\ncounts as a harm. In many cases it seems not to. You would benefit me\nby transferring all your savings to my bank account (let us assume);\nit doesn\u2019t follow that your failure to do so harms me. Why not?\nPresumably, because we assess harms counterfactually: if x\nharms me, it makes me significantly worse off than I would have been\notherwise. This makes clear that harms are assessed relative to some\nbaseline. It is an interesting question how to set the baseline. But\nthe baseline cannot be set by the restriction on liberty itself; that\nwould convert all failures to benefit into harms. The baseline must\nhave some independent rationale. Consider Mill\u2019s example of Good\nSamaritan laws. A classic example of the sort of Samaritan duty that\nMill favors would be the requirement to save a drowning child when I\ncould do so at little cost or risk to myself. It is not clear that my\nfailure to rescue harms the child. Have I made the child worse-off\nthan he would otherwise have been? Well, relative to what baseline? Of\ncourse, I have made him worse-off relative to the baseline situation\nin which Good Samaritanism is compulsory. But why select that\nbaseline? I haven\u2019t made him worse-off relative to the situation\nhe would have been in had I not been there. By hypothesis, he would\nhave drowned in my absence. If so, it is not clear that I harm the\nperson whom I fail to rescue. This is not to deny that my failure to\nrescue is wrong and perhaps that the law ought to compel aid in such\ncases. But it does raise questions about whether we can justify Good\nSamaritan laws by appeal to the harm principle.\n\nNotice that even if my failure to rescue the child does not harm him,\nhe is nonetheless harmed by drowning. After all, he would have been\nbetter off had he not fallen into the pond and drowned. This suggests\na possible way for Mill to square Good Samaritan laws with the harm\nprinciple. Even if restrictions on A\u2019s freedom,\nrequiring him to benefit B, cannot be justified on grounds of\npreventing A from harming B, they may nonetheless be\njustified on the grounds of preventing harm to B. This draws\nour attention to a significant ambiguity in the harm principle (see\nLyons 1979). Mill talks both about preventing one from harming others\nand about harm prevention. Indeed, his statement of the one very\nsimple principle mentions both (OL I 9). But as the Samaritan\nexample brings out, these two claims are not equivalent. Every time I\nprevent one person from harming another, I also engage in harm\nprevention. But some cases of preventing harm may not be cases of\npreventing one person from harming another. So we really should\ndistinguish two different versions of the harm principle.\n\nHP1 is an anti-harming principle: A can restrict\nB\u2019s liberty only in order to prevent B from harming\nothers.\nHP2 is a harm-prevention principle: A can\nrestrict B\u2019s liberty only in order to prevent harm\nto others.\n\n\nBecause every case of preventing one person from harming another is a\ncase of harm prevention, but not vice versa, HP1 is narrower than HP2.\nIndeed, HP1 is a proper part of HP2. Whereas HP1 justifies\nintervention only when the target herself would be the cause of harm\nto others, HP2 would justify intervention to prevent harm to others,\nwhether that harm would be caused by the target or in some other way.\nClearly, HP2 will justify more intervention than HP1. As we have seen,\nit is hard to justify Good Samaritan laws if HP is the sole basis for\nrestricting liberty as long as we understand HP as HP1. The fact that\nMill thinks Samaritan laws can be squared with the harm principle (I\n11) is evidence that he understands the harm principle in terms of\nharm prevention.\n\nA different worry about the necessity of harm concerns those cases\ninvolving restrictions on liberty in the compulsory provision of\npublic goods. For it is part of the structure of public goods that the\neffect of individual contributions on provision of the public good is\nnegligible. The negative impact of an individual\u2019s failure to\ncontribute is both small and is spread widely over the population. But\nthat means that even if failure to provide public goods would\notherwise count as a serious loss for all and a harm, the cost of\nindividual failures to provide for such goods does not seem to meet\nMill\u2019s criteria for harmful conduct\u2014the impact of\nindividual failures to contribute to public goods is too small and\nspread too widely to constitute the breach of \u201ca distinct and\nassignable obligation to any other person or persons\u201d (IV 10).\nInsofar as this is a worry for the harm principle, it seems to be\nequally a worry for HP1 and for HP2.\n\nOne Millian response is to deny that the harm principle is intended to\nserve as a necessary condition on any and all restrictions on liberty.\nAs we saw, Mill is interested in defending fundamental or\nbasic liberties, rather than liberty per se. In\nparticular, he is interested in liberties of conscience and expressive\nliberties, liberties of tastes and pursuits, and liberties of\nassociation (I 12). He can defend these liberties as playing a more\ncentral role in our practical deliberations and our formation and\npursuit of personal ideals than other liberties. But then Mill might\ntry to justify the modest restrictions on liberty necessary to provide\nthe benefits of significant public goods by claiming that, even if\nthese restrictions on liberty don\u2019t prevent harms, they do not\nrestrict fundamental liberties and they do help secure other goods,\nsuch as education, security, and sanitation, that serve as necessary\nconditions of our happiness.\n\nThis issue requires us to distinguish two more readings of the harm\nprinciple: one in terms of liberty per se and one in terms of\nbasic liberties. This distinction cuts across the distinction between\nanti-harming and harm prevention, giving us four possible\ninterpretations of the necessity claim.\n\nHP1A: A can restrict B\u2019s liberty\nonly in order to prevent B from harming others.\nHP1B: A can restrict B\u2019s basic\nliberties only in order to prevent B from harming\nothers.\nHP2A: A can restrict B\u2019s liberty\nonly in order to prevent harm to others.\nHP2B: A can restrict B\u2019s basic\nliberties only in order to prevent harm to others.\n\n\nEarlier, we suggested that the harm principle would be more robust and\nbetter fit with Mill\u2019s views about justified restrictions of\nliberty if we understood it is a harm prevention principle,\nessentially, as HP2A, rather than HP1A. Now we have seen how the harm\nprinciple would be more robust and better fit Mill\u2019s views about\njustified restrictions of liberty if we understood it to regulate\nrestrictions on basic liberties, rather than liberty per se.\nThis requires us to interpret the harm principle as HP2B. We might\ncall this the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But\nif we interpret the harm principle this way, then Mill is even further\nfrom a libertarian view, at least if libertarianism is understood as\nthe idea that the only legitimate limit on individual liberty is to\nprevent that individual from acting in ways that harm others.\n\nThe necessity claim that the harm principle makes is more robust if we\ninterpret it as the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But,\neven so interpreted, the necessity claim is still false. For all\nversions of the harm principle insist that paternalism is an\nimpermissible rationale for restriction. But Mill does not in fact\naccept a blanket prohibition on paternalism. He allows paternalistic\nrestrictions on selling oneself into slavery (V 11). In a moment, we\nwill discuss the justification and scope of this exception to the\nnormal prohibition on paternalism. But the exception itself shows that\nMill does not think that the only acceptable restrictions on liberty\nare those that prevent harm to others. For this is a case in which it\nis permissible to restrict liberty, not to prevent harm to others, but\nto prevent a special kind of harm to self.\n\nIf harm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient for justifying\nrestrictions on liberty, then Mill\u2019s \u201cone very simple\nprinciple\u201d is over-simple.\n3.7 Paternalism\n\nInsofar as Mill insists that preventing harm to others is the only\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberty, he is committed\nto a blanket prohibition on paternalism. Why? Mill offers two explicit\nreasons.\n\nFirst, state power is liable to abuse. Politicians are self-interested\nand corruptible and will use a paternalistic license to limit the\nfreedom of citizens in ways that promote their own interests and not\nthose of the citizens whose liberty they restrict (V 20\u20133).\n\nSecond, even well intentioned rulers will misidentify the good of\ncitizens. Because an agent is a more reliable judge of his own good,\neven well intentioned rulers will promote the good of the citizens\nless well than would the citizens themselves (IV 4, 12).\n\nThese are reasonably strong consequentialist arguments against giving\nthe state a broad discretionary power to engage in paternalistic\nlegislation whenever it sees fit. However, they do not support a\ncategorical ban on paternalism. In particular, these arguments provide\nno principled objection to paternalism\u2014no objection to\nsuccessful paternalistic restrictions on B\u2019s\nliberty that do in fact benefit B. This weakness in\nMill\u2019s explicit argument against paternalism is like the\nweakness in his truth-tracking defense of freedom of expression. Just\nas that argument provided no objection to successful censorship\n(censorship of all and only false belief), so too this argument\nprovides no objection to successful paternalism (A\u2019s\nrestrictions on B\u2019s liberty that do benefit\nB). Perhaps some who object to paternalism are only concerned\nwith unsuccessful paternalism. But many would have doubts about\nsuccessful paternalism. For it is common to think that individuals\nhave a right to make choices in their own personal affairs and that\nthis includes a right to make choices that are imprudent.\n\nHowever, Mill\u2019s perfectionist conception of happiness provides a\nmore robust rationale against paternalism. For if a person\u2019s\nhappiness depends on her exercise of the capacities that make her a\nresponsible agent, then a principal ingredient of her own good must\ninclude opportunities for responsible choice and self-determination.\nBut then it becomes clear how autonomy is an important part of a\nperson\u2019s good and how paternalism undercuts her good in\nimportant and predictable ways. Mill may still not have an argument\nagainst successful paternalism, but his perfectionism gives him an\nargument that successful paternalism is much harder to achieve than\none might have thought, because it is very hard to benefit an\nautonomous agent in ways that bypass her agency.\n\nDespite Mill\u2019s blanket prohibitions on paternalism, he does not\n(consistently) reject paternalism per se. For instance, he is\nforced to qualify his blanket prohibition on paternalism in order to\nmaintain his claim that no one should be free to sell himself into\nslavery.\n\n\nThe ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his\nown lot is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case.\n\u2026 [B]y selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty;\nhe foregoes any future use of it beyond that single act. He,\ntherefore, defeats in his own case, the very purpose which is the\njustification of allowing him to dispose of himself. (V 11)\n\n\nBecause it is the importance of exercising one\u2019s deliberative\ncapacities that explains the importance of certain liberties, the\nusual reason for recognizing liberties provides an argument against\nextending liberties to do things that will permanently undermine\none\u2019s future exercise of those same capacities. In this case, an\nexception to the usual prohibition on paternalism is motivated by\nappeal to the very same deliberative values that explain the usual\nprohibition. So this seems to be a principled exception to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism. We might call these autonomy-enhancing\nforms of paternalism.\n\nMill claims that the reasons for allowing paternalism in \u201cthis\nextreme case\u201d are \u201cevidently of far wider\napplication\u201d (V 11). That raises the question of what other\nforms of paternalism might be justified as principled exceptions to\nthe usual prohibition on paternalism. Unfortunately, Mill does not\ndirectly address this question. However, in a nearby passage Mill does\nrefer to the \u201calmost despotic power of husbands over\nwives\u201d (V 12). We might see Mill likening a wife\u2019s consent\nto marriage, in which she must surrender various rights of control\nover herself and her children, to someone contracting herself into\nslavery. This, of course, is a theme that he develops in The\nSubjection of Women (discussed below).\n3.8 Offense\n\nAs we have seen, Mill distinguishes between merely offensive and\ngenuinely harmful behavior. Whereas genuinely harmful behavior can be\nregulated, merely offensive behavior cannot (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10,\n12; V 5). However, in his discussion of drunkenness, Mill does at one\npoint allow that offenses against others may be prohibited, at least\nwhen they involve acts of public indecency.\n\n\nAgain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the\nagents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if\ndone publicly, are a violation of good manners and, coming thus within\nthe category of offenses against others, may be rightly prohibited. Of\nthis kind are offenses against decency; on which it is unnecessary to\ndwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our\nsubject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case\nof many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so.\n(V 7)\n\n\nThe immediate context is otherwise paternalistic restrictions with\ndrink. But when drinking that is otherwise purely self-regarding is\ndone in public, it becomes offensive and, Mill here claims, regulable.\nIt seems impossible to square this with Mill\u2019s blanket\nprohibition on offense regulation. Why this exception for public\noffenses? Mill\u2019s answer is that when done in public, the conduct\ncomes \u201cthus within the category of offense against\nothers.\u201d But if publicity is relevant because it makes the\nconduct offensive, then Mill\u2019s real appeal is to offense. But\nthen this exception threatens to swallow the rule.\n\nMill may not have a consistent view about offense. It is instructive\nin this context to consider briefly the views of Joel Feinberg, who\nsees himself articulating a Millian position in his important\nfour-volume work Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\n(1984\u201388). Feinberg understands his own defense of Millian\nprinciples as involving a modified Millian categorical approach. His\nmain modification of Millian principles is to permit some forms of\noffense regulation. In Offense to Others (1985), Feinberg\nbegins by focusing on nuisance. Many offensive things are\nnuisances; they cause passing disagreeable mental states or\nsensations. But even if many nuisances are just the price one has to\npay to live in a free society, it is common for the law to regulate\nnuisance. Feinberg thinks that some nuisances\u2014especially public\nnuisances\u2014can justify regulation. To determine when offense\n(nuisance) regulation is permissible and when it is not, Feinberg\nemploys a balancing test in which we must weigh the\nseriousness of the offense (e.g., its magnitude and avoidability)\nagainst the importance of the agent\u2019s interests being regulated\n(e.g., their importance and the existence of alternative avenues of\nexpression).\n\nThe details of Feinberg\u2019s balancing test are complex and\npotentially controversial. But most liberal societies do in fact allow\nfor some nuisance regulation. If one is going to consider modifying\nMill\u2019s categorical approach so as to allow the prevention of\nprofound nuisance, then one must employ some such balancing test and\nallow restriction only when the offense is hard to avoid, the\nexpressive interests of the offenders are modest, and offenders have\nalternative avenues of expression. Since Mill\u2019s own position on\noffense regulation is not fully consistent, it is hard to say how big\na modification this would make in his liberal principles.\n3.9 Moralism\n\nMill, we saw, appears to reject legal moralism categorically (I 9).\nOther Millian liberals, such as Feinberg, treat the rejection of legal\nmoralism as a constitutive commitment of liberalism. Of course, a\ngreat deal of morality is concerned with harm prevention, and central\nprovisions of the criminal law prohibiting killing, rape, assault, and\ntheft are clearly concerned to prevent especially serious moral wrongs\nthat harm others. This means that much of the criminal law both\nprevents harm and enforces morality. These are not simply coincidental\noutcomes, inasmuch as the immorality of much criminal conduct consists\nin its harmfulness. This could make us wonder if there are cases of\nlegal moralism that can\u2019t be justified by appeal to the harm\nprinciple.\n\nEven if there is considerable overlap between harmful conduct and\nwrongdoing, the two are distinguishable. The traditional debate over\nlegal moralism between Devlin (1965) and Hart (1963) concerned the\nlegislative enforcement of sexual morality, in particular, the\nregulation of homosexuality, prostitution, and pornography. For the\nmost part, both sides conceded that these activities were immoral but\nharmless and debated whether it could be permissible to regulate them\nas a matter of enforcing sexual morality. But we might reject\nDevlin\u2019s moralistic proposals, not because we reject legal\nmoralism per se, but rather because we do not regard\nhomosexuality, prostitution, or pornography as per se\nimmoral. If these were the only candidates for harmless wrongdoing, we\nmight wonder if there was such a thing. For this reason, we might\nconsider a less controversial case of harmless immorality, say, a case\nof promise-breaking or deception that actually fails to result in\nharm. Suppose Junior takes his parents\u2019 car out without their\npermission but nothing untoward happens. Here is a case of harmless\nwrongdoing. Consider this argument for moral legislation.\n\nSociety has reason to prohibit behavior that is immoral, whether\nor not it causes harm.\nJunior\u2019s taking the car without parental permission is a\ncase of harmless wrongdoing.\nHence, society has a right to prohibit Junior\u2019s\nbehavior.\n\n\nPresumably, liberals would reject (3), claiming that this is a case in\nwhich the law should not intervene. Here, it might seem that we need\nto reject the moralistic premise in (1) in order to avoid the\nilliberal conclusion in (3). Indeed, many people tend to think that to\navoid illiberal conclusions about moral legislation one must reject\nlegal moralism as such.\n\nBut the argument is not valid, from which it follows that we cannot\nappeal to the falsity of the illiberal conclusion to reject the\nmoralistic premise. The legal moralist principle (1) asserts only a\npro tanto or prima facie reason to regulate. But a\npro tanto reason to regulate does not entail an\nall-thing-considered reason to regulate. In particular, even if there\nis some reason to regulate conduct, there may be countervailing\nreasons not to regulate it. Perhaps the costs of\nregulation\u2014administrative and otherwise\u2014exceed the benefit\nof regulation. But this shows that the legal moralist need not\nregulate all harmless wrongdoing, and this shows that it is not\nnecessary to reject legal moralism as such in order to defend some\nliberal conclusions. This does not entail that Mill\u2019s rejection\nof legal moralism is wrong, only that it is not necessary to deliver\nmost of his liberal conclusions.\n\nThis shows us that we should distinguish stronger and weaker legal\nmoralist claims.\n\nWeak Moralism: an action\u2019s wrongness is pro\ntanto reason to regulate it.\nStrong Moralism: an action\u2019s wrongness is\nconclusive reason to regulate it.\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve just seen, liberal claims that harmless immorality\nshould not be regulated are inconsistent with strong moralism, but not\nwith weak moralism. It\u2019s clear that Mill rejects strong\nmoralism. What is less clear is whether he also rejects weak moralism.\nWe must endorse weak moralism if we think that there are cases of\nharmless wrongdoing where legal regulation is not only pro\ntanto justified but also on-balance justified. Any list is\npotentially controversial, but many people would think that it is not\nonly permissible but also desirable to regulate unsuccessful criminal\nattempts, fraud and blackmail that do not harm, desecration of the\ndead, and bestiality. If any of these should be regulated, that may\nrequire weak legal moralism.\n3.10 The Categorical Approach Revisited\n\nMill\u2019s \u201cone very simple principle\u201d\u2014that\nliberty may be restricted always and only to prevent harm to\nanother\u2014is over-simple. So too is the related categorical\napproach to liberty that approves all applications of the harm\nprinciple and rejects all cases of paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and legal moralism.\n\nThe harm principle itself is complex in several ways. Harm to others\nis not a sufficient ground for restricting liberty. Rather, it creates\na pro tanto reason for restricting liberty. Determination of\nwhether restrictions on harmful conduct are fully justified depends on\nbalancing the evils of regulation against the harm to be prevented.\nMoreover, it is not clear if the harm principle justifies restricting\nliberty to prevent others from being harmed or only justifies\nrestricting liberty to prevent those whose liberty is being restricted\nfrom causing harm to another. The anti-harming rationale for\nrestricting liberty is narrower than the harm-prevention rationale.\nOnly the broader harm-prevention rationale would explain how Mill\ncould hope to square Good Samaritan laws and laws compelling testimony\nin court with the harm principle. Because the harm-prevention\nprinciple is broader, it will justify greater restrictions on liberty\nthan the anti-harming principle. It is also unclear whether the harm\nprinciple protects all liberty or just basic liberties. The harm\nprinciple is more robust if it targets restrictions on basic\nliberties, rather than liberty per se. But if we qualify the\nharm principle in these ways, we are very far from the common\nlibertarian reading of the harm principle as limiting any and all\nliberty only to prevent force or fraud.\n\nHowever these questions are resolved, it is doubtful that the harm\nprinciple is necessary to justify restrictions on liberty. Mill makes\nprincipled exceptions to his general anti-paternalism to defend the\npermissibility of restrictions on selling oneself into slavery and\nother autonomy-enhancing forms of paternalism. Mill does allow some\nforms of offense regulation designed to prevent public indecency.\nMoreover, though Mill does seem more consistent in his opposition to\nlegal moralism, it is not necessary to reject legal moralism as such\nin order to recognize the liberal conclusion that many forms of legal\nmoralism do not do enough good in order to justify the harms they\ncause.\n\nHarm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient to restrict\nindividual liberties. Nonetheless, one might argue that Mill\nrecognizes basic liberties as especially important interests that can\nonly be interfered with to prevent harm to others and or to prevent\nsignificant harm to the individual\u2019s own agency.\n3.11 Utilitarianism, Rights, and Liberalism\n\nHaving examined Mill\u2019s liberalism we can return to the apparent\ntension between liberal rights and utilitarianism. For even if Mill\nemploys complex, rather than simple, categories, there appears to be a\ntension between categorical protections of basic liberties and the\nsort of case-by-case consequentialist analysis that utilitarianism\nwould seem to require. We might consider three different\nreconciliation strategies.\n3.11.1 The Sanction Theory of Rights\n\nMill\u2019s explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of\nUtilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty,\nwhich is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong\nactions as actions that it is useful to sanction (U V 14).\nMill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice\ninvolves duties that are perfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are\ncorrelated with rights (V 15).\n\n\nJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong\nnot to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a\nmatter of right. (V 15)\n\n\nMill explains his theory of rights in terms of the two elements in a\nrights violation\u2014an injury to the right holder and warranted\npunishment.\n\n\nThese [two] elements are, a hurt to some assignable person or persons\non the one hand, and a demand for punishment on the other. \u2026\n[T]hese two things include all that we mean when we speak of violation\nof a right. When we call anything a person\u2019s right, we mean that\nhe has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession of\nit, either by the force of law, or by that of education and opinion.\nIf he has what we consider a sufficient claim, on whatever account, to\nhave something guaranteed to him by society, we say that he has a\nright to it. If we desire to prove that anything does not belong to\nhim by right, we think this is done as soon as it is admitted that\nsociety ought not to take measures for securing it to him, but should\nleave it to chance, or to his own exertions. (V 24)\n\n\nThis is a sanction theory of rights, akin to Mill\u2019s sanction\ntheory of duty. It says that one has a right to some interest or\nliberty insofar as society ought to protect that interest or\nliberty.\n\nSo far, this conception of a right does not yet introduce any\nutilitarian considerations. Mill adds utilitarianism to the mix in his\naccount of the conditions under which society ought to enforce an\nindividual\u2019s claim.\n\n\nTo have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society\nought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to\nask why it ought, I can give him no other reason than general utility.\n(V 25)\n\n\nThis sanction theory of rights is an indirect utilitarian one insofar\nas it implies that whether someone has a right to something depends\nnot on the utility of that claim but on the utility of our responses\nto violations of that claim.\n\nDoes the sanction theory of rights provide a good reconciliation of\nrights and utility? Not surprisingly, the sanction theory of rights\ninherits the problems of the sanction theory of duty. Recall that we\nfound sanction utilitarianism to be internally inconsistent insofar as\nit combines indirect and direct utilitarian claims\n (\u00a72.10).\n Because the sanction theory of rights is committed to sanction\nutilitarianism, it inherits this inconsistency.\n\nX has a right to Y iff society ought to protect\nX\u2019s claim to Y from interference (the first\npart of the sanction theory of rights).\nSociety ought to protect X\u2019s claim to Y\nfrom interference iff doing so is optimal (the second, direct part of\nthe sanction theory of rights).\nSociety ought to protect X\u2019s claim to Y\nfrom interference iff it would be optimal to blame society for failing\nto do so (the indirect sanction theory of duty).\n\n\n(2) and (3) are inconsistent. One could respond by decoupling the\nsanction theory of rights from the sanction theory of duty. But if we\nreject the sanction theory of duty, why accept a sanction theory of\nrights?\n\nMoreover, the sanction theory of rights has problems of its own. The\nsanction theory of rights treats the desirability of social\nenforcement as constitutive of the idea of a right. But this seems to\nget things backward. It is because we have rights that society ought\nto enforce them; it is not that we have rights to whatever society\nought to enforce. The desirability of social enforcement seems\nconsequential on the existence of the right. This is even\nclearer, because there are some claims that society ought to enforce\nthat are not rights. Among the things that society ought to recognize\nand protect are both rights and privileges. The exact line\nbetween rights and privileges is not always clear. But we recognize\nthe distinction in claiming that some interests and opportunities that\nthe state ought to protect are not ones that can be claimed as a\nmatter of right. This shows that the usefulness of social enforcement\ncannot be constitutive of a right, because otherwise privileges would\nbe rights.\n\nThough the sanction theory is Mill\u2019s explicit conception of\nrights, he has the resources for two other conceptions.\n3.11.2 Rights as Secondary Principles\n\nWe saw that Mill recognizes the need for various secondary principles\nin moral reasoning\n (\u00a72.9).\n These are principles that do not themselves refer to utility but\nwhose adoption and general deployment are justified on utilitarian\ngrounds. So one way for Mill to reconcile rights and utility is for\nhim to treat rights as secondary principles, perhaps especially\nimportant ones, whose observance is justified on utilitarian grounds\n(also see Berger 1984: chs. 3\u20134). On this interpretation, rights\nare protected by rules that insulate an individual\u2019s interest or\nliberty from certain kinds of interference and that make no direct\nreference to the good consequences of insulation. We should observe\nsuch rules more or less uncritically, and set them aside only when\nadherence to them is clearly suboptimal or in cases of conflicts among\nsuch rules (rights). In such exceptional cases, we should make direct\nappeal to the principle of utility. But, otherwise, not.\n\nWhy should we regulate our conduct by such rules? Because doing so is\ngenerally but imperfectly optimal, and we are unable to discriminate\nfor cases in which deviation form the rules is suboptimal without\ndeviating from them in other cases in which it is not.\n3.11.3 Rights as Pre-eminent Goods\n\nWhy should we believe that there are interests or liberties that it is\ngenerally but imperfectly optimal to protect? Mill\u2019s answer is\nthat some interests and liberties play a more fundamental role in\nhuman happiness than others. On this reading, rights protect\npre-eminent or especially important goods.\n\n\nWhile I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an\nimaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the\njustice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and\nincomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality.\nJustice is a name for certain classes of moral rules which concern the\nessentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more\nabsolute obligation, than any other rules for the guidance of life;\nand the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of\njustice\u2014that of a right residing in an individual\u2014implies\nand testifies to this more binding obligation. (U V 32; also\nsee V 33, 37\u201338)\n\n\nIndeed, if the goods protected by rights are so important, we can\nunderstand why Mill might think that society ought to enforce them by\nlaw or opinion (V 24). But notice that here enforceability is a\nconsequence of the importance of rights, rather than the defining\nfeature of rights.\n\nThis conception of rights presupposes a hierarchy of values\nin which some kinds of goods are superior to others. We know that Mill\naccepts a hierarchy of values from his doctrine of higher pleasures.\nThat doctrine treats the possession and use of capacities for\npractical deliberation as higher-order goods. Various liberties of\nthought and action are important as necessary conditions for realizing\nthese higher-order goods.\n\nBut if the rights we have are to especially important goods, then we\ncan see how honoring rights promotes the good. By hypothesis, it will\nbe best to honor rights when this conflicts with the promotion of\nlesser goods. We might say that rights \u201ctrump\u201d these\nlesser goods. Rights don\u2019t trump the pursuit of other comparably\nimportant goods. These should be treated as conflicts of rights, and\nthe utilitarian should resolve such conflicts by recourse to the\nutilitarian first principle and a determination of which right, in the\ncontext, is most important.\n\nThese three conceptions of rights offer somewhat different ways of\nreconciling utility and rights. The biggest difference is between the\nsanction theory, on the one hand, and the secondary principle and\npre-eminent goods conceptions, on the other hand, because the first is\nan indirect utilitarian conception of rights, whereas the second two\nare compatible with direct utilitarianism. Whereas the sanction theory\nof rights appears problematic, the secondary principles and\npre-eminent goods conceptions appear more plausible. It would be\npremature to say that they are fully adequate conceptions of rights,\nbut they do offer some promise of reconciling utility and rights.\n4. Liberal Democracy\n\nWe get a somewhat different perspective on Mill\u2019s utilitarian\nand liberal principles by seeing how he applies them to social and\npolitical issues. We might begin by focusing on Mill\u2019s defense\nof a democratic form of liberalism in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government and Principles of Political\nEconomy.\n\nIn Considerations on Representative Government Mill argues\nthat a form of representative democracy is the best ideal form of\ngovernment. It is not an invariant ideal that holds regardless of\nhistorical or social circumstances. But he does think that it is the\nbest form of government for societies with sufficient resources,\nsecurity, and culture of self-reliance. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat representative democracy is best, when it is best, because it\nbest satisfies two criteria of all good government: (1) that\ngovernment is good insofar as it promotes the common good, where this\nis conceived of as promoting the moral, intellectual, and active\ntraits of its citizens, and (2) that government is good insofar as it\nmakes effective use of institutions and the resources of its citizens\nto promote the common good (CRG 390, 392). Insofar as (2) is\nreally a component of (1), Mill\u2019s ultimate criterion is that\ngood government should promote the common good of its citizens. Mill\ndoes not explicitly invoke his version of utilitarianism. Perhaps he\nwants his defense of representative democracy to rest on more\necumenical premises. But he clearly understands this political\ncriterion of the common good in broadly consequentialist or\nresult-oriented terms. Moreover, though he may not mention the higher\npleasures doctrine explicitly, it is also clear that Mill understands\nthe good of each in broadly perfectionist terms that emphasize the\nimportance of an active and autonomous form of life that exercises\nintellectual, deliberative, and creative capacities.\n4.1 Representative Democracy\n\nMill thinks that there are two ways in which democracy is, under the\nright circumstances, best suited to promote the common good.\n\nFirst, he thinks that democracy plays an important epistemic\nrole in identifying the common good. Proper deliberation about issues\naffecting the common good requires identifying the consequences\nof different policies for the interests of affected parties\nand so requires the proper representation and articulation of the\ninterests of citizens. But failure of imagination and the operation of\npersonal bias present obstacles to the effective representation of the\ninterests of others. Universal suffrage and political participation\nprovide the best assurance that the interests of the governed will be\nproperly appreciated by political decision-makers (404).\n\nSecond, Mill thinks that democracy is also the best form of government\nbecause of the constitutive effects of political\nparticipation on the improvement of the moral capacities of citizens\n(404). To the extent that the governed can and do participate in\npublic debate and elections they exercise those very deliberative\ncapacities that it is the aim of government to develop. They learn to\ngather information about their options, deliberate about their merits,\nand choose a representative who will give expression to their\nideals and preferences. They deliberate and choose with others about a\npublic agenda, and in so doing they cultivate abilities to form a\nconception of a common good, to take principled stands, to exchange\nreasons with others, and to learn from others.\n\nSo far, these would seem to be arguments for widespread\u2014indeed,\nuniversal\u2014direct democracy. In fact, unlike many of his\ncontemporaries interested in expanding the franchise, Mill defends the\nextension of the franchise to women too, rejecting any restriction on\ntheir franchise as baseless (479). But Mill qualifies this defense of\ndirect democracy in various significant ways.\n\nDemocracy presumably involves rule by the will of the people. We might\nsay that a political system is democratic insofar as the content of\nits political decisions reflect the will of the people. A direct\ndemocracy, in which every citizen votes on legislation, is one way for\npolitical decisions to reflect the will of the people. But direct\ndemocracy is impractical in anything but a small community (412). Mill\ndefends representative, rather than direct, democracy.\n\nMill believes that representatives are charged with the task of\nvoting, after free and open discussion, their own considered views\nabout what would promote the common good (490). Here Mill expresses\ndoubts about an interest group model of democracy, according to which\nrepresentatives are advocates of the sectarian interests of their\nconstituents and democracy is seen as an impartial aggregation and set\nof compromises among sectarian interests. Instead, Mill regards\nrepresentatives as fiduciaries in a public trust, in which each\nrepresentative aims at a genuinely common good, and in which\nindividual and collective deliberations are shaped by a diversity of\nexperiences and perspectives.\n\nMany needs are local in nature, and, even when the needs are general,\ntheir satisfaction may depend heavily on local conditions. For this\nreason, Mill advocates a federal system in which a central\nrepresentative body has more limited functions and local or municipal\nrepresentative bodies govern in matters involving local affairs or\nlocal detail, such as the creation and maintenance of local\ninfrastructure, including roads, courts, jails, and schools\n(422\u201334).\n\nHowever, one important function of a central government, Mill\nbelieves, is the need to protect local political minorities from being\nsystematically disadvantaged by local political majorities (544). Here\nhe shows his concern with individual rights against the tyranny of the\nmajority, which was a focus of On Liberty and suggests\nthat constitutional guarantees may be better preserved by central,\nrather than local, authorities. Unfortunately, he does not devote much\nattention to exactly which individual rights should be recognized\nconstitutionally.\n\nMill also insists that a representative democracy, either local or\nfederal, should employ proportional, rather than\nwinner-take-all, representation (CRG 449\u201362;\n\u201cThoughts on Parliamentary Reform\u201d 328\u201329). We can\nsee how proportional representation fits with the epistemic argument\nfor democracy. Winner-take-all representation may eliminate or reduce\neffective expression of minority points of view so essential for free\nand informed inquiry about the common good and respecting the\ninterests of political minorities (CRG 458).\n4.2 The Scope of the Franchise and Weighted Voting\n\nIn his philosophical writings and in his service as a Liberal member\nof Parliament for Westminster from 1865 to 1868, Mill was a vigorous\nadvocate for extending the franchise. Though he recognized some limits\nin the scope of the franchise, he was a consistent, though not always\nsuccessful, advocate for its extension beyond its then\ncurrent scope. He supported extending the franchise to previously\ndisenfranchised members of the working class, and he was a staunch\nadvocate for female suffrage (479\u201381). To many, such views about\nthe appropriate scope of the franchise seemed quite radical. Though\nMill did support weighted voting, he may have seen this, at least in\npart, as a necessary concession to succeed in securing his primary\nobjective of (near) universal suffrage (476). It is worth bearing this\ncontext in mind when evaluating Mill\u2019s proposals for the scope\nand weight of the franchise.\n\nAs we noted earlier, Mill does not defend representative democracy as\nideal under all historical and social circumstances. There are some\nsocial circumstances, he thinks, in which democracy will not promote\nthe common good. These are backward states of society in which most\ncitizens are unfit to rule, because they lack necessary ingredients of\nthe culture of autonomy to exercise decision-making authority\nresponsibly. They lack discipline, or education, or an active and\nindependent character. Different forms of government are appropriate\nfor such backward states of advancement. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat benevolent rule by an enlightened one or few, which aimed at the\ncommon good, would be better suited for such societies (415\u201318).\nHere, Mill is introducing a scope limitation on the defense of\npolitical rights that he recognized explicitly in his defense of basic\nliberties in On Liberty (I 10). There are important practical\nquestions, which Mill does not address very clearly, about which\nsocieties cross this threshold of capacity for improvement by free\ninquiry and political rights. We might reasonably disagree with\nMill about what the competence threshold is and which societies\nsatisfy \n it.[2] \n But he does make clear that political participation, like free\ninquiry, is important as a necessary condition for the exercise of our\nhigher capacities and has value only when a threshold level of\nnormative competence is met.\n\nWhat is true of some societies in relation to others is also true of\nsome individuals in relation to others within societies that cross\nthis threshold of normative competence. This explains limitations on\nthe scope of the franchise that Mill recognizes within such advanced\ncivilizations. He confines the scope of the franchise to mature\nadults, excluding minors who would not have crossed the threshold of\nnormative competence. He is also prepared to exclude those adults who\nare not literate (CRG 470\u201371). This is a failure of\nnormative competence for which society is to blame and which it is\nsociety\u2019s duty to correct (470). Mill also excludes from the\nfranchise those adults who do not pay taxes and are on public\nassistance (472). Here he expresses the concern that voting gives one\na say not only over one\u2019s own life but also over the lives of\nothers and that without contributing to the production of an economic\nsurplus one has no right to help determine how this surplus is\ndistributed. Mill is also committed to doubts about the normative\ncompetence of those on public assistance. Elsewhere, Mill insists that\ncharities make beneficiaries dependent on benefactors in ways that\ncompromise their autonomy and independence (PPE V.xi.13;\nSW 330). Insofar as this is true, it provides an additional\nrationale for excluding dependents from the franchise.\n\nThe main limitations on the scope of the franchise that Mill\nrecognizes track this threshold of normative competence. Mill thinks\nthat the reasons for favoring democracy apply to all those above this\nnormative threshold. Literate manual laborers have the same claim to\nthe franchise, Mill thinks, as anyone else. They need to stand up for\ntheir own interests and make sure they are properly reckoned in\npolitical decision-making. Moreover, they stand to benefit from\npolitical participation, because of the way it develops their\ndeliberative capacities.\n\nOf course, there are differences in normative competence among those\nabove this threshold. But Mill\u2019s account of representative\ndemocracy tracks these further differences in terms of the\nweight, rather than the scope, of the franchise\n(CRG 473). Differences in normative competence above this\nthreshold should affect the comparative weight of one\u2019s vote.\nThis scheme of weighted voting takes the form of a system of plural\nvotes (CRG 467\u201381; also see \u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 322\u201328). Mill emphatically rejects property\nqualifications as suitable proxies for normative competence\n(CRG 474; \u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d 325) and insists\non educational qualifications.\n\n\nThe most direct mode of effecting this, would be to establish the\nplurality of votes, in favour of those who could afford a reasonable\npresumption of superior knowledge and cultivation. \u2026 The\nperfection, then, of an electoral system would be, that every person\nshould have one vote, but that every well-educated person in the\ncommunity should have more than one, on a scale corresponding as far\nas practicable to their amount of education. (\u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 324\u201325)\n\n\nThere is an upper limit on the system of plural votes such that the\nweighted votes of the educational elite will not give them a majority\ncoalition that could advance its class interests at the expense of the\nuneducated (CRG 476).\n\nMill\u2019s commitment to weighted voting reflects his views about\nthe backward state of the working classes.\n\n\nThe opinions and wishes of the poorest and rudest class of labourers\nmay be very useful as one influence among others on the minds of the\nvoters, as well as on those of the Legislature; and yet it may be\nhighly mischievous to give them the preponderant influence, but\nadmitting them, in their present state of morals and intelligence, to\nthe full exercise of the suffrage. (\u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d\n334)\n\n\nDespite these doubts about the working classes, Mill regarded himself\nas their friend (Autobiography 274; see Ten 1998). Mill did\nnot blame the working classes for what he saw as their lesser\ncompetence, and he did not regard their backwardness as a natural\nor permanent condition. He thought that improved access to quality\nprimary and secondary education and greater scope for civic\nparticipation would gradually improve normative competence in the\nworking classes (PPE IV.vii.2). Insofar as this is true, the\nqualification to Mill\u2019s commitment to political equality,\nrepresented by his scheme of weighted voting, is temporary and\ntransitional. In this sense, weighted voting is not part of ideal\npolitical theory in the way that (near) universal suffrage and\nproportional representation are.\n\nEven if weighted voting tracks the epistemic reasons for democracy and\ndifferences in underlying normative competence, it violates norms of\npolitical equality. Mill seems not to recognize the potentially\ncorrosive effects of weighted voting in terms of the message it sends\nof second-class citizenship to the working classes. He thinks that\nself-respect requires only that one have the vote, not that one have\nan equal vote, regardless of normative competence.\n\n\nThere is not, in this arrangement [weighted voting], anything\nnecessarily invidious to those to whom it assigns the lower degrees of\ninfluence. Entire exclusion from a voice in the common concerns is one\nthing; the concession to others of a more potential voice, on the\nground of greater capacity for the management of the joint interests,\nis another. The two things are not merely different, they are\nincommensurable. Everyone has a right to feel insulted by being made a\nnobody, and stamped as of no account at all. No one but a fool\n\u2026 feels offended by the acknowledgment that there are others\nwhose opinion \u2026 is entitled to a greater amount of\nconsideration than his. (CRG 474)\n\n\nBut why should I care so much about being branded a nobody and not at\nall about being branded a lesser somebody? One might well want to\nharness the resources and expertise of an educated elite, perhaps, as\nMill already imagines, by giving them special roles in the drafting of\nlegislation or in setting the agenda for public deliberations. But\nthis does not require giving the educated elite plural votes. Doing\nthat seems to have significant symbolic value, saying that working\nclasses should have less political standing and say. From this\nperspective, Mill displays something of a tin ear for\negalitarian concerns about weighted voting. Interestingly, while\nhe does not seem especially sensitive to concerns about the bad\neffects of second-class citizenship in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government, he seems much more sensitive to such\nconcerns in The Subjection of Women. As we will see, Mill is\nacutely aware of the variety of ways in which women\u2019s\ncontributions can be discouraged and undervalued and of the individual\nand social costs of women\u2019s second-class status. Had Mill been\nas mindful of the costs of according workers second-class citizenship\nas he would later be of the costs of according women second-class\nstatus, he might have been more skeptical of weighted voting than he\nin fact was.\n4.3 Liberal Democracy and the Common Good\n\nWhat of the substance of democratic government? Though Mill is an\nadvocate of limited government in ways that one might expect given his\ndefense of basic liberties in On Liberty, he is no\nlibertarian. He emphatically rejects the idea that legitimate\ngovernment is limited to the functions of affording protection against\nforce and fraud (PPE V.i.2). Instead, he thinks that there\nare a variety of ways in which government can and should intervene in\nthe lives of citizens\u2014sometimes as coercer and other times as\nenabler or facilitator\u2014in order to promote the common good.\nMill\u2019s claims about happiness imply that the good of each\nconsists in the exercise of her higher capacities. This requires an\nactive life in which one\u2019s activities are regulated by\none\u2019s deliberations and choices. As we have seen in Mill\u2019s\ncritical discussions of paternalism, this places limits on how others\ncan promote one\u2019s own good. I can\u2019t promote your good,\nunderstood in this way, in ways that bypass your agency anymore than I\ncan win a race for you. But just as I can do things to help you win\nthe race yourself (training with you, sharing nutritional tips, and\nhelping you plan strategy), so too I can do things that help you lead\nan autonomous life. I can provide various sorts of necessary\nconditions for your leading such a life. If an individual\u2019s good\nconsists in this sort of self-realization, then a government\nwhich aims at the common good should concern itself in significant\npart with the fair provision of opportunities for\nwelfare.\n\nEarly in The Subjection of Women Mill contrasts systems of\nhereditary caste, such as feudalism and social systems based on\nslavery, with the distinctively modern and progressive commitment to\nequal opportunity for welfare.\n\n\nFor, what is the peculiar character of the modern world\u2014the\ndifference which chiefly distinguishes modern institutions, modern\nsocial ideas, modern life itself, from those of times long past? It is\nthat human beings are no longer born into their place in life, and\nchained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but\nare free to employ their faculties, and such favorable chances as\noffer, to achieve the lot which may appear to them most desirable.\n(SW 272\u201373)\n\n\nAs with basic liberties, opportunities for welfare have value, not in\nthemselves, but as necessary conditions for the sort of\nself-realization to which Mill assigns pre-eminent intrinsic value.\nBut they are no less important for that reason. Indeed, many of the\nfunctions of government that he recognizes can be traced to providing\nconditions and opportunities for self-realization.\n\nThough Mill generally opposes paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and moralism, he does recognize various functions that\ngovernment should perform in pursuing the common good. In part because\nthe opportunities for each depend in part upon the position and\nresources of others, Mill thinks that provision of fair equality of\nopportunity constrains permissible socio-economic inequalities\n(PPE II.ii.1).\n\n\nA just and wise legislation would abstain from holding out motives for\ndissipating rather than saving the earnings of honest exertion. Its\nimpartiality between competitors would consist in endeavoring that\nthey should all start fair \u2026. Many, indeed, fail with greater\nefforts than those with which others succeed, not from difference of\nmerits, but difference of opportunities; but if all were done which it\nwould be in the power of a good government to do, by instruction and\nby legislation, to diminish this inequality of opportunities, the\ndifferences of fortune arising from people\u2019s own earnings could\nnot justly give umbrage. (PPE V.ii.3)\n\n\nAs Mill makes clear in this passage, his concern is not with\ninequality as such. Though he envisions a society in which\ninequalities are reduced and in which a decent minimum standard of\nliving is available to all (PPE IV.vi.2), he does defend the\nprofits of capitalists as a just recompense for their savings, risk,\nand economic supervision (PPE II.xv.1; \u201cChapters on\nSocialism\u201d 734\u201335). Rather, Mill\u2019s concern in this\npassage is with inequalities derived from inequality of opportunity\nand those inequalities that perpetuate inequality of opportunity. To\nachieve equality of opportunity, Mill endorses various redistributive\ntax measures (also see Berger 1984: 159\u201386). He defends a flat\ntax rate on earned income above a threshold necessary to secure a\ndecent minimum standard of living, leaving earned income below this\nthreshold untaxed (PPE II.i.3, II.xii.2, II.xii.3,\nV.ii.1\u20133, V.iii.3\u20135). In addition, he endorses the use of\nhigher tax rates on unearned income and on inheritance (PPE\nII.ii.1, II.ii.3\u20134, II.xii.3, V.ii.3, V.ii.5, V.vi.2, V.ix.1).\nSuch taxes limit intergenerational inequalities that would otherwise\nconstrain equality of opportunity.\n\nWithin this framework established for equal opportunity, Mill defends\nadditional governmental functions designed to promote the common good.\nA prime condition of normative competence is a decent education, and\nMill thinks that it is one of the central roles of the state to\nrequire and, if necessary, provide a quality education (OL V\n12\u201313; PPE V.xi.8). Mill thinks that the state can and\nshould require parents to provide schooling for their children,\nensuring that this kind of education is available to all, regardless\nof financial circumstances, by subsidizing the costs of education for\nthe poor so that it is available free or at a nominal cost.\n\nWe have also seen that Mill thinks that charity breeds dependence,\nrather than autonomy. This is one reason that he defends the adoption\nof Poor Laws that provide, among other things, work for the\nable-bodied indigent (PPE II.xii.2). Mill also thinks that\ngovernment should step in where market forces are unlikely to provide\nwhat people need or want (PPE V.xi.8). In this way, he thinks\nthat it is an important function for the state, whether central or\nlocal, to create and maintain various aspects of community\ninfrastructure, including such things as a common defense, roads,\nsanitation, police, and correctional facilities (PPE V.vii.1;\nCRG 541). He also thinks regulation of working conditions\n(hours, wages, and benefits) is permissible, because the provision of\nimproved working conditions typically has the structure of a public or\ncollective good for workers, each of whom stands to gain a competitive\nadvantage by conceding a little more to capital than his peers\n(PPE V.xi.12). If left unregulated, each has incentive to\nconcede more to capital than his rivals, with the result that all\nworkers are made worse-off. State intervention and regulation, Mill\nthinks, is the best solution to this collective action problem. He\nalso thinks that there are other goods for which market provision will\nlead to underproduction, presumably because of positive externalities,\nwhich is why he thinks that the state should subsidize scientific\nresearch and the arts (PPE V.xi.15).\n\nMill\u2019s liberalism is committed to democratic political\ninstitutions in which the franchise is widespread, private property\nrights, market economies, equal social and economic opportunity, and a\nvariety of personal and civic liberties. To appreciate the\nsignificance of his brand of liberalism, it is helpful to focus on the\nsubstance of his conception of liberal essentials\u2014the package of\nindividual liberties and state responsibilities that he\nendorses\u2014and the way he justifies his conception of liberal\nessentials. Millian liberalism is not laissez-faire liberalism, and it\njustifies liberal essentials as a way of promoting the common good.\nThe distinctiveness of this brand of liberalism is perhaps best seen\nin contrast with two other conceptions of liberalism\u2014a more\nlibertarian conception of liberal essentials and their justification\nthat dominated the British Liberal Party at mid-century and the sort\nof contemporary political liberalism that justifies liberal essentials\nas required if the state is to be neutral among rival conceptions of\nthe good life that its citizens might hold.\n\nA good part of the agenda of the Liberal Party during much of the\nnineteenth century consisted in reforms that sought to undo\nlimitations that the state placed on the liberties and opportunities\nof citizens, especially when these forms of state intervention tended\nto reinforce class privileges. This political culture was exemplified\nin the repeal of the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution,\nand several electoral reforms. But in the later part of the nineteenth\ncentury there emerged a new view about the role of such reforms within\nthe Liberal agenda. Earlier Liberals, such as Herbert Spencer, thought\nthat reform should be limited to the removal of state interference\nwith individual liberty. By contrast, the New Liberals thought that\nthese reforms that extended economic, social, and political liberties\nhad to be supplemented by social and economic reforms in areas of\nlabor, education, and health designed to redress the effects of\ninequality. These new reforms gave the state positive, and not just\nnegative, responsibilities that sometimes required interference with\nindividual liberties. Because Mill thinks that the state has an\nimportant role to play in securing equal opportunity, ensuring a good\neducation that will nurture normative competence, and redressing\nvarious market failures and providing various public goods, it makes\nsense to view Mill as laying much of the intellectual groundwork for\nthe New Liberalism\u2014both in its conception of liberal essentials\nand in its conception of the proper justification of liberal\nessentials by appeal to a broadly consequentialist interest in\npromoting self-realization.\n\nMill\u2019s perfectionist justification of liberal essentials also\nprovides a contrast with an influential strand in recent\nAnglo-American philosophical defenses of liberalism that insist on\nneutrality among rival conceptions of the good life (see\nTurner 2017). According to many contemporary liberals, neutrality\nabout the good is a constitutive commitment of liberalism, and liberal\nneutrality places limits on the justification of state action. Liberal\ngovernments, on this view, can and must enforce individual rights and\nany further demands of social justice, including those necessary to\nmaintain peace and order. But they are not to undertake any action as\na way of promoting a particular conception of the good life or a\ncomprehensive philosophical doctrine. On matters of the good, a\nliberal state must be strictly neutral. It can promote the good of its\ncitizenry only in ways that are consistent with every reasonable\nconception of the good (see Rawls 1993 and Kymlicka 1989).\n\nBy contrast, Mill is a perfectionist liberal who eschews neutrality\nabout the good. According to Millian perfectionism, the good life is\nnot defined in sectarian terms as consisting in a particular set of\nactivities. Rather, the good life is understood in terms of the\nexercise of capacities for practical deliberation that can be realized\nin diverse, though limited, ways. Basic liberties are important\nbecause they are necessary conditions for this sort of reflective\nself-direction and self-realization. On this version of liberalism,\nthe state recognizes various civil liberties and resists regular\npaternalism and moralism, not because it won\u2019t take a stand on\nquestions of the good, but precisely because it recognizes autonomy\nand self-determination as higher-order goods.\n5. Sexual Equality\n\nMill applies his liberal principles to issues of sexual equality\nprimarily in The Subjection of Women. He denounces existing\nforms of sexual inequality in clear and unequivocal terms.\n\n\n[T]he principle which regulates the existing social relations between\nthe two sexes\u2014the legal subordination of one sex to the\nother\u2014is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to\nhuman improvement; and \u2026 it ought to be replaced by a principle\nof perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side,\nnor disability on the other. (SW 261)\n\n\nTo modern ears, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality may seem\nobvious, and, to some contemporary feminists, Mill\u2019s criticism\nof sexual inequality may not be deep or consistent enough. But, when\nviewed in historical context, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality\nis radical, courageous, and sometimes eloquent (Shanley 1998). While\nMill clearly expected some aspects of his liberal principles in On\nLiberty to be controversial (OL I 6\u20138), their\nrevolutionary import became especially clear when he applied them\nto issues of sexual equality in The Subjection of Women\n(Nicholson 1998: 471).\n5.1 The Case for Sexual Equality\n\nMill rejects sexual inequality in both domestic and social contexts.\nHe discusses domestic equality primarily in Chapter II. There, he\nfocuses on the rights of wives and mothers, recognizing women\u2019s\nequal rights over their bodies or persons (SW 283\u201386),\nto own and control property (284\u201385, 297) to control various\naspects of domestic decision-making and household management\n(290\u201392), to custody and care of children (285), and to\nseparation and divorce (285\u201386). But Mill is not only concerned\nwith wives and mothers in domestic contexts. He also defends equal\nrights to education (315\u201316), to professional\nopportunities (299; cf. PPE IV.vii.3), to vote in political\nelections (301), and to run for political office (301). In addition to\nthese rights, Mill presumably also endorses equal rights to freedom of\nexpression, worship, and association. One assumes that he sees the\nmain threats to these rights as occurring in the domestic realm and\ncoming from husbands, fathers, and brothers.\n\nAt times, Mill defends sexual equality on explicitly consequentialist\ngrounds as a way of making fuller use of people\u2019s talents and\npromoting a culture of equal opportunity, accountability, and genuine\nmeritocracy (326\u201328). But Mill also defends sexual equality as a\nmatter of individual rights and justice.\n\n\nThus far, the benefits which it has appeared that the world would gain\nby ceasing to make sex a disqualification for privileges and a badge\nof subjection, are social rather than individual; consisting in an\nincrease of the general fund of thinking and acting power, and an\nimprovement in the general conditions of the association of men and\nwomen. But it would be a grievous understatement of the case to omit\nthe most direct benefit of all, the unspeakable gain in private\nhappiness to the liberated half of the species; the difference to them\nbetween a life of subjection to the will of others, and a life of\nrational freedom. After the primary necessities of food and raiment,\nfreedom is the first and strongest want to human nature. (336)\n\n\nIn elaborating this claim about women\u2019s higher-order interests\nin liberty, he says that personal independence is an \u201celement of\nhappiness\u201d (336\u201337). This echoes the arguments in On\nLiberty for claiming that basic liberties are necessary for\npersons to exercise the deliberative capacities that make them\nprogressive beings.\n\nIn defending women\u2019s rights, Mill also appeals to the\ndistinctively modern and progressive commitment to equal\nopportunity for welfare (272\u201373). At several points, he\nlikens the status of women inside and outside of marriage to slavery\n(284\u201386, 323). Mill is not much impressed by those who would\ndispute the analogy on the ground that women are treated much better\nthan slaves. Gilded cages are still cages that restrict freedom and\nopportunity. And often the cages are not gilded; Mill insists that\nhusbands can be and often are just as violent and abusive as masters\n(285\u201386, 288\u201389). Indeed, with the demise of slavery in\nAmerica, he views sexual inequality as the last vestige of slavery in\nthe West.\n\n\nThe law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all\nthe principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through\nwhich those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out. It\nis the sole case, now that negro slavery has been abolished, in which\na human being in the plenitude of every faculty is delivered up to the\ntender mercies of another human being, in the hope forsooth that this\nother will use the power solely for the good of the person subjected\nto it. Marriage is the only actual bondage known to our law. There\nremain no legal slaves, except the mistress of every house. (323)\n\n\nThe restrictions contained in Victorian marriage law that give\nhusbands complete control over the person and property of their wives\nand that do not allow for unilateral divorce or separation make\nmarriage a form of sexual or gendered slavery. Slavery is an\nimpermissible restriction of the liberty of another. Slavery would be\nimpermissible even if the wife consented to marriage (270). Mill might\nquestion whether the consent is meaningful given the social pressures\nto marry and to defer to their husbands, the limited options for those\nwho do not marry, and the adverse consequences to women of expressing\ndissent within marriage (270). But the quality of consent should be in\nany case irrelevant, because we know that Mill thinks that it is\nimpermissible to contract into slavery and that paternalistic laws\nthat prevent such contracts are not only permissible but obligatory\n(OL V 11). Presumably, this is just the sort of case that\nMill has in mind when he suggests that the prohibition of selling\noneself into slavery is a principled exception to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism that has \u201cwider application.\u201d\nThis norm of equal opportunity for welfare, which is violated by\nVictorian marriage law, is a demand of justice (SW 325) and\ngrounds a claim of right.\n5.2 Rebutting the Case for Inequality\n\nMill considers and replies to various actual and possible defenses of\nsexual inequality. In most cases, the apologist for inequality alleges\nthat women are naturally inferior in relation to men along some\ndimension that is alleged to be relevant to the proper management of\npersonal and public affairs. For the most part, the apologist claims\nthat men possess some trait essential for normative competence that\nwomen lack\u2014these might be represented as alleged female\ndeficits\u2014or that women possess some trait that men lack\nthat threatens normative competence\u2014these might be represented\nas alleged female disqualifiers. In either case, the\napologist argues, it turns out that women are naturally inferior and\nso do not deserve equal treatment.\n\nMill considers a large list of potential natural differences, not\nrestricted to deficits and disqualifiers, including claims that women\nare (1) more intuitive and practical, less principled and theoretical,\nthan men (305), (2) more focused on particulars, less capable of\nabstraction or generalization, than men (306), (3) more nervous and\nexcitable than men (308), (4) less single-minded than men (310), (5)\nless accomplished in philosophy, science, and art than men\n(313\u201314), (6) less original than men (314\u201315), (7) morally\nsuperior to men (320\u201321), (8) more susceptible to personal bias\nthan men (321), (9) more pacific and less aggressive than men\n(329\u201330), (10) more philanthropic than men (330), and (11) more\nself-sacrificing and self-abnegating than men (293).\n\nMill\u2019s response to these alleged differences is mixed.\nSometimes, he questions whether the traits in question are unevenly\ndistributed. But, for the most part, he seems to concede that the\ntraits are unevenly distributed. He doesn\u2019t always agree that\nthe female trait is a deficit or disqualifier. For instance, he thinks\nthat being more intuitive, more practical, more focused on\nparticulars, and less rigid allows women to compensate for deficits in\nthe way that men typically approach decision-making. Women are less\nlikely to follow principle for its own sake and are more likely to\ntest principles by their real world consequences. They are better able\nto multi-task and intellectually more open-minded. Being morally\nsuperior and less aggressive are unqualified goods. However, he seems\nto concede that women are more excitable, less accomplished, and less\noriginal than men. He tries to explain these deficits and\ndisqualifiers in ways that do not presuppose women\u2019s natural\ninferiority.\n\nMill\u2019s primary response to the apologists is to claim that even\nif the trait is unevenly distributed and functions as a deficit or\ndisqualifier there is nonetheless no evidence of natural inferiority.\nThere is no evidence of natural inferiority, because we cannot be sure\nthat the incapacity is the product of nature, rather than nurture. In\nparticular, because the history of sexual relations has been\ndiscriminatory, we cannot rule out the possibility that female\nincapacity is the product of past discriminatory treatment\n(275\u201377, 304\u201305, 313).\n\n\nI consider it a presumption in any one to pretend to decide what women\nare or are not, can or cannot be, by natural constitution. They have\nalways hitherto been kept, as far as regards spontaneous development,\nin so unnatural a state, that their nature cannot but have been\ngreatly distorted and disguised; and no one can safely pronounce that\nif women\u2019s nature were left to choose its direction as freely as\nmen\u2019s, and if no artificial bent were attempted to be given to\nit except that required by the conditions of human society, and given\nto both sexes alike there would be any material difference, or perhaps\nany difference at all, in the character and capacities that would\nunfold themselves. (304\u201305)\n\n\nMill rightly insists that incapacity that is the product of\ndiscriminatory treatment cannot be appealed to justify that\ndiscrimination. That would be circular reasoning.\n\nMill can explain differential accomplishments in philosophy, science,\nand the arts by appeal to social barriers to women\u2019s\nparticipation in these fields (313\u201318) and to competing domestic\ndemands that are placed on them (318\u201319). In this connection, it\nis worth noting that Mill can concede not only differential\naccomplishments of the sexes but differential capacity, in at least\none sense. For Mill can and should distinguish between actual\ncapacity and potential capacity. Actual capacities determine\nwhat an agent is now able to do, whereas potential capacities\ndetermine what actual capacities she can develop. For instance, I have\nno actual capacity to speak Russian, but presumably I do have a\npotential capacity to speak Russian. By contrast, I don\u2019t have\neven a potential capacity to fly or run a three-minute mile. Actual\ncapacities are a function of potential capacities and suitable\ntraining, opportunities, and responsibilities. If I have not been\ngiven a proper education and training with suitable deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities at various points in my\ndevelopment, my potential competence may not be actualized. Even if\neveryone had equal potential capacities, we should expect unequal\nactual capacities in systems where education and deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities have been distributed unequally. If\nso, then greater actual capacity would not be evidence of greater\npotential capacity.\n\nThe moral that Mill draws is that equal rights should prevail in the\nabsence of any good evidence about the way in which natural assets and\npotential capacities are distributed by gender. Equality is the\npresumption, even if it is a rebuttable presumption, and the\npresumption can only be rebutted on the basis of adequate empirical\nevidence (262).\n5.3 Is the Sexual Division of Labor Natural?\n\nIn rebutting potential defenses of sexual inequality by appeal to\nvarious alleged dimensions of natural inferiority, Mill insists that\nwe cannot determine whether traits commonly found in women are the\nproduct of nature or nurture without suitable social experimentation,\nincluding, the social experiment of sexual equality. In particular,\nthere is the very real possibility that the traits alleged to justify\nsexual discrimination are the product of past discriminatory practice.\nBut Mill does not adhere to this point consistently (see Annas 1977;\nOkin 1979: 226\u201330). At several points, he expresses the\nconviction that most women with a full menu of opportunities will\naccept a traditional sexual division of labor in which they perform\ndomestic functions while their husbands pursue professions in civil\nsociety, and he approves of this traditional division of labor.\n\n\nWhen the support of the family depends, not on property, but on\nearning, the common arrangement, by which the man earns the income and\nthe wife superintends the domestic expenditure, seems to me in general\nthe most suitable division of labor between the two persons. \u2026\nIn an otherwise just state of things, it is not, therefore, I think, a\ndesirable custom, that the wife should contribute by her labour to the\nincome of the family. (SW 297)\n\n\nOf course, Mill is right that a wife should not also have to\nearn a living outside the home if she is working full time within the\nhome. But he gives no reason for thinking that women should have\nfamilies or that, if they do, they, rather than their husbands, should\nbe responsible for matters domestic. Indeed, Mill\u2019s view seems\nto be that for women extra-domestic vocations should be reserved\nprimarily for those without children or whose children are already\ngrown (338). He seems here to assume that the traditional sexual\ndivision of labor is natural. Of course, it is possible that the\ntraditional sexual division of labor would emerge in a system of equal\nopportunity. But this is conjecture. Indeed, one might have thought\nthat his own claims about how the system of unequal opportunity has\nrepressed women\u2019s creative and managerial capacities would have\nsuggested that the traditional sexual division of labor was probably\nnot robust. In defending or at least speculating about the robustness\nof the traditional sexual division of labor, Mill appears to be\nignoring his own methodological strictures.\n5.4 Millian Feminism\n\nThis is a significant blemish on Mill\u2019s feminist credentials. He\nsometimes assumed that a traditional sexual division of labor was\nnatural in the sense that it was likely to emerge in a culture of\nequal opportunity for all. Given Mill\u2019s recognition that the\nexisting division of labor was produced and sustained in conditions of\nsexual discrimination and unequal opportunity, there is no basis for\nsupposing that this division of labor would survive a culture of\nequality. However, it is Mill himself that supplies the resources for\ncriticizing his assumption. That ought to provide partial mitigation\nof his mistake.\n\nOtherwise, Mill\u2019s feminist credentials are strong. He is a keen\ncritic of domestic and social forms of inequality, recognizing the\nharm such practices cause women and the ways in which they deform the\nlives of boys and men too. Victorian marriage law, the denial of the\nfranchise, and lack of social and economic opportunities violate\nhigher-order interests of women. These rights violations are a matter\nof serious social injustice. The corollary of these criticisms is that\nMill is a staunch defender of equal opportunity for women and an\neloquent spokesman for the way in which a culture of equality would\ntransform the lives of girls and women, liberating their creative\npotential and emotional sensibilities, and make possible more\nproductive social cooperation and friendships among equals.\n\nMill\u2019s discussion of sexual equality is one place where the\nperfectionist underpinnings of his liberal principles play an\nimportant role and add to the depth of his criticisms of sexual\ndiscrimination and his case for sexual equality. His defense of sexual\nequality highlights the genuinely progressive aspects of his\nutilitarian and liberal commitments.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nAs perhaps the leading historical proponent of two important normative\ntraditions\u2014utilitarianism and liberalism\u2014Mill occupies an\nunusually important position in the history of western moral and\npolitical philosophy. Viewed in historical context, both\nutilitarianism and liberalism have exerted considerable progressive\ninfluence on the scope of moral concern, the design of public\ninstitutions, the responsibilities of government, and the interests\nand rights of the governed. Mill did much to articulate the\njustification, content, and implications of utilitarian and liberal\nprinciples. Inevitably, there are questions about the proper\ninterpretation, adequacy, and consistency of his various claims on\nthese topics. But he has left an enduring legacy in both utilitarian\nand liberal traditions. Both traditions figure centrally in\ncontemporary discussions of analytical ethical and political theory.\nFurther progress in these traditions must take account of his\ncontributions.\nA Note on Texts and References\n\nReferences to Mill\u2019s texts and other historical texts will be by\ntitle or short title; references to contemporary articles and books\nwill be by year of publication. Publication details and conventions\nfor referring to Bentham\u2019s and Mill\u2019s texts are provided\nin this Note (below). Otherwise, publication details can be found in\nthe Bibliography. If a parenthetical reference does not identify the\ntext in question, the reader should assume that it is the last\nidentified text being referenced again (context should make it\nclear).\nBentham\u2019s Works\n\nBentham\u2019s writing were originally published as The Works of\nJeremy Bentham, 11 vols., ed. J. Bowring (Edinburgh: William\nTait, 1838\u201343) and are\n available electronically.\n I refer to the following works, employing the associated\nabbreviations.\n\nIntroduction to the Principles of Moral and Legislation\n[Principles] (1789) Works vol.

Works\npagination.\nConstitutional Code (1832) Works IX. References\nby chapter and section number.\n\n\nSo, for instance, Principles I 2 refers to paragraph 2 of\nchapter I of the Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation.\nMill\u2019s Works\n\nThere are many editions of Mill\u2019s more popular and influential\nworks, including many of his writings in moral and political\nphilosophy. The definitive edition of Mill\u2019s writings is\nCollected Works of John Stuart Mill [CW], 33\nvolumes, ed. J. Robson (Toronto: University of Toronto Press,\n1965\u201391) and\n available online through the Liberty Fund.\n In order to facilitate common reference among readers using different\neditions of his most commonly read\ntexts\u2014Utilitarianism, On Liberty, A System\nof Logic, and Principles of Political Economy\u2014I\nwill refer to those works using natural divisions in his texts, such\nas chapter, section, and/or paragraph. Otherwise, I will refer to\nMill\u2019s works using pagination in his Collected Works.
