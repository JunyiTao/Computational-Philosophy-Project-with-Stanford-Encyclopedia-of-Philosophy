    "main_text": "The Emergence of Procedural Rationality || Accuracy and Effort\n2.1 Accuracy and Effort\n\nHerbert Simon and I.J. Good were each among the first to call\nattention to the cognitive demands of subjective expected utility\ntheory, although neither one in his early writings abandoned the\nprinciple of expected utility as the normative standard for rational\nchoice. Good, for instance, referred to the recommendation to maximize\nexpected utility as the ordinary principle of rationality,\nwhereas Simon called the principle objective rationality and\nconsidered it the central tenet of global rationality. The\nrules of rational behavior are costly to operate in both time and\neffort, Good observed, so real agents have an interest in minimizing\nthose costs (Good 1952: 7(i)). Efficiency dictates that one choose\nfrom available alternatives an option that yields the largest result\ngiven the resources available, which Simon emphasized is not\nnecessarily an option that yields the largest result overall (Simon\n1947: 79). So reasoning judged deficient without considering the\nassociated costs may be found meritorious once all those costs are\naccounted for\u2014a conclusion that a range of authors soon came to\nendorse, including Amos Tversky:\n\n\nIt seems impossible to reach any definitive conclusions concerning\nhuman rationality in the absence of a detailed analysis of the\nsensitivity of the criterion and the cost involved in evaluating the\nalternatives. When the difficulty (or the costs) of the evaluations\nand the consistency (or the error) of the judgments are taken into\naccount, a [transitivity-violating method] may prove superior.\n(Tversky 1969)\n\n\nBalancing the quality of a decision against its costs soon became a\npopular conception of bounded rationality, particularly in economics\n(Stigler 1961), where it remains commonplace to formulate boundedly\nrational decision-making as a constrained optimization problem. On\nthis view boundedly rational agents are utility maximizers after all,\nonce all the constraints are made clear (Arrow 2004). Another reason\nfor the popularity of this conception of bounded rationality is its\ncompatibility with Milton Friedman\u2019s as if methodology\n(M. Friedman 1953), which licenses models of behavior that ignore the\ncausal factors underpinning judgment and decision making. To say that\nan agent behaves as if he is a utility maximizer is at once\nto concede that he is not but that his behavior proceeds as if he\nwere. Similarly, to say that an agent behaves as if he is a utility\nmaximizer under certain constraints is to concede that he does not\nsolve constrained optimization problems but nevertheless behaves as if\nhe did.\n\nSimon\u2019s focus on computationally efficient methods that yield\nsolutions that are good enough contrasts with Friedman\u2019s as if\nmethodology, since evaluating whether a solution is \u201cgood\nenough\u201d, in Simon\u2019s terms, involves search procedures,\nstopping criteria, and how information is integrated in the course of\nmaking a decision. Simon offers several examples to motivate inquiry\ninto computationally efficient methods. Here is one. Applying the\ngame-theoretic minimax algorithm to the game of chess calls for\nevaluating more chess positions than the number of molecules in the\nuniverse (Simon 1957a: 6). Yet if the game of chess is beyond the reach\nof exact computation, why should we expect everyday problems to be any\nmore tractable? Simon\u2019s question is to explain how human beings\nmanage to solve complicated problems in an uncertain world given their\nmeager resources. Answering Simon\u2019s question, as opposed to\napplying Friedman\u2019s method to fit a constrained optimization\nmodel to observed behavior, is to demand a model with better\npredictive power concerning boundedly rational judgment and decision\nmaking. In pressing this question of how human beings solve uncertain\ninference problems, Simon opened two lines of inquiry that continue to\ntoday, namely:\n\n\n\nHow do human beings actually make decisions \u201cin the\nwild\u201d?\n\n\nHow can the standard theories of global rationality be simplified to\nrender them more tractable?\n\n\nSimon\u2019s earliest efforts aimed to answer the second question\nwith, owing to the dearth of psychological knowledge at the time about\nhow people actually make decisions, only a layman\u2019s\n\u201cacquaintance with the gross characteristics of human\nchoice\u201d (Simon 1955a: 100). His proposal was to replace the\noptimization problem of maximizing expected utility with a simpler\ndecision criterion he called satisficing, and by models with\nbetter predictive power more generally.\n",
