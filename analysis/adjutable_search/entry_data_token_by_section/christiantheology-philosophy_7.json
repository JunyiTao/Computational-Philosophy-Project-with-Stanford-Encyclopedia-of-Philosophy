    "main_text": "Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology || Atonement and Salvation\n2.3 Atonement and Salvation\n\nArguably, the deepest and most fundamental Christian affirmation is\nthat Christ saves. In traditional terminology, another way to express\nthe same affirmation is that Christ \u201catones\u201d for the sins\nof human beings. Unlike the doctrines of the Trinity and the\nIncarnation, however, the early Church never formally defined a single\northodox account of exactly how Christ saves or what it is about his\nlife, death, and resurrection that accomplishes that saving work. As a\nresult, a variety of theories or models of atonement have proliferated\nthroughout the centuries. Contemporary work in analytic philosophical\ntheology typically builds on these models, reformulates them in\ncontemporary language, and seeks to defend them from criticism.\n\nSatisfaction models argue that as a result of their sinfulness, human\nbeings have a debt or obligation to God that they cannot possibly\nrepay. By becoming incarnate, living a sinless life, and voluntarily\ndying for the sake of humanity, Christ successfully discharges the\ndebts and obligations that human beings owe to God. Anselm\u2019s\n\u201cWhy God Became Human\u201d (Cur deus homo) is the\nlocus classicus for the satisfaction theory, which has more\nrecently been defended by Swinburne (1988). Closely related to\nsatisfaction models, penal substitution models claim that human beings\ndeserve punishment from God as a result of their sinfulness. Christ\nsaves by freely agreeing to be punished in their place. Mark Murphy\n(2009) proposes a similar model of \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d,\non which Christ\u2019s suffering actually counts as the required\npunishment for guilty human beings, since knowing that a loved one\nsuffers in one\u2019s place is itself a form of punishment.\n\nSatisfaction and penal substitution theorists must explain why a\nperfectly merciful God would require satisfaction or punishment from\nhuman beings at all, and why a perfectly just God would allow an\ninnocent person to play the required role (Porter 2004). Accordingly,\nsatisfaction and penal substitution views have been heavily criticized\nby modern and contemporary theologians for depicting God as a petty,\nwrathful tyrant. Adolph von Harnack\u2019s nineteenth-century\ncriticism of Anselm remains representative. According to Harnack,\nAnselm\u2019s account depends on a\n\n\nmythological conception of God as the mighty private man, who is\nincensed at the injury done to His honor and does not forego His wrath\ntill He has received an at least adequately great equivalent. (1899:\n77)\n\n\nMore recently, feminist theologians and philosophers have criticized\nsatisfaction and penal substitution views for valorizing suffering\n(Brown and Parker 1989).\n\nEleonore Stump (2018) argues that typical satisfaction and penal\nsubstitution accounts cannot address the sinner\u2019s persistent\ndispositions toward wrongdoing and concomitant feelings of shame. She\ndubs her positive proposal the \u201cMarian\u201d interpretation of\natonement, and argues that it can explain how sinners are freed from\nshame and restored to fellowship with God. The proposal defies easy\nsummary but it advances an account of atonement as union with God that\nis further explained using second-personal, psychological notions like\n\u201cmind-reading\u201d and empathy (2018: 138\u2013139). Christ\non the cross mind-reads\u2014that is, psychically\nexperiences\u2014the mental states of every human sinner. Sinful\nhuman beings are thereby united to Christ, and so to God. When the\nindwelling Holy Spirit leads sinners to respond to Christ with love,\nthey also will what God wills. The resulting state of union with God\nalso heals the stain on the soul that is the sinner\u2019s shame.\n\nSeveral other models, also prominent in the Patristic and medieval\ntradition, have so far received little attention from analytic\nphilosophers of religion. These include \u201cransom\u201d theories\non which human beings are freed from Satan\u2019s grasp, and\nespecially \u201ctheosis\u201d or \u201cdivinization\u201d\naccounts of atonement and salvation, on which Christ\u2019s saving\nwork consists in perfecting human beings so that they become as divine\nas a creature can be. (Jacobs 2009 and Mosser 2021 are important\nexceptions). Similarly, few contemporary philosophers defend the\nmodern \u201cmoral exemplar\u201d model, on which Christ saves by\nbeing a perfect moral example for other human beings to imitate.\n(Quinn 1993 offers a highly qualified defense, but holds that Christ\nis more than just a moral exemplar).\n",
