    "main_text": "Overcoming Dualism || An Epistemological Meaning of Not Two\n5.2 An Epistemological Meaning of Not Two\n\nFrom the point of view of epistemology developed by modern European\nphilosophy, the \u201ctwo things\u201d are the subject who knows and\nthe object that is known. Zen finds that these two things impose on\nthe epistemological subject a structuring that is framed dualistically\nand either-or ego-logically, as mentioned in the foregoing.\nAccordingly, this structuring unknowingly frames things to appear\ndualistically and either-or ego-logically to the epistemological\nsubject, while extending the paradigm to itself for self-understanding\nas well as things other than itself in the same manner. Consequently,\nthe subject stands opposed either to the outer world (e.g.,\nnature) or to the inner world (the world of psyche\u0304), or\nboth, and hence it promotes an oppositional mode of thinking.\nMoreover, Zen notes that the subject cannot by definition become the\nobject or vice versa, for they are distanced from each other either\nreally or ideally. It depends on whether the \u201cdistance\u201d\nand \u201copposition\u201d occur in space-consciousness or in\ntime-consciousness; an object appears to be \u201cout there\u201d\nwith space-consciousness, while it appears to be \u201cin here\u201d\nas an immanent object in the field of consciousness in\ntime-consciousness. Suppose one applies this epistemological structure\nin knowing others, for example, one\u2019s friend. When one attempts\nto know her from the everyday standpoint, one relies on the language\nshe speaks and her body language. Here one cannot know her in\ntoto, let alone the destiny of her life-history, because she is\nshielded from an observer by the spatial-temporal density of her\nbeing. \n",
