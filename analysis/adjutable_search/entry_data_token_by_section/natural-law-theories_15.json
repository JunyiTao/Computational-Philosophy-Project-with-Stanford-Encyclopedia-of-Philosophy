    "main_text": "Other elements of natural law theory || Responsibility and punishment\n6.3 Each legal system is of and for a particular political community\n\n\nExamination of (i) how one legal system becomes independent of another\nby lawful processes and (ii) how parts of a legal system (e.g., its\nconstitution, or its rules for identifying office-holders) are\nreplaced by the unlawful processes of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or\nrevolution demonstrates (see Raz 1979, 100\u2013109) that the\nidentity of a subsisting legal system as one and the same system of\nlegal norms cannot be explained (or even coherently described) by an\naccount which refers only to the norms and their inter-relationships\nas validating norms and validated norms. The non-momentary identity of\na legal system is a function of the subsisting identity of the\ncommunity whose legal system it is. Legal theory is sub-alternated to\nthe historical understanding (including self-understanding) of a\ncommunity and its members as being this\ncommunity\u2014paradigmatically, this nation-state\u2014rather\nthan some accidental sequence or agglomeration of persons and events,\nand this understanding must be in some substantial measure\nnon-dependent upon the legal norms that the community may succeed in\nconstituting for itself and its members. Doubtless the shared purpose\nof living together under a rule of law, and the shared memory of a\nshared acknowledgment or recognition of such laws as our laws, are\nnormally important components of such a shared understanding of\npolitical-communal and legal identity. But other shared purposes,\nmemories and dispositions to act must be also be substantially\npresent, if the phenomena of lawful independence and revolutionary\nconstitutional change are to be as they are.\n\n\nThe not uncritical realism of natural law theory, evidenced in its\napproach to the realities of intention as distinct from foresight and\ninattention, and of self-preferential choice and the differing\nrelationships between (i) offender and law-abiding and (ii) tortfeasor\nand victim, similarly enables it to undertake a critical reflection,\nwithin legal theory broadly understood, on the kinds of community\ncapable of sustaining and being ordered in part by a legal system.\n",
