    "main_text": "The Rationality of Voting || Voting to Change the Outcome\n1.1 Voting to Change the Outcome\n\nOne reason a person might vote is to influence, or attempt to change,\nthe outcome of an election. Suppose there are two candidates, D\nand R. Suppose Sally prefers D to R. Suppose she\ncorrectly believes that D would do a trillion dollars more\noverall good than R would do. If her beliefs were correct, then\nby hypothesis, it would be best if D won.\n\nHere, casting the expected value difference between the two candidates\nin monetary terms is a simplifying assumption. Whether political\noutcomes can be described in monetary terms as such is not without\ncontroversy. To illustrate, suppose the difference between two\ncandidates came down entirely to how many lives would be lost in the\nway they would conduct a current war. Whether we can translate\n\u201clives lost\u201d into dollar terms is controversial. Further,\nwhether we can commensurate all the distinct goods and harms a\ncandidate might cause onto a common scale is also controversial.\n\nEven if the expected value difference between two candidates could be\nexpressed on some common value scale, such as in monetary terms, this\nleaves open whether the typical voter is aware of or can generally\nestimate that difference. Empirical work generally finds that most\nvoters are badly informed, and further, that many of them are not\nvoting for the purpose of promoting certain policies or platforms over\nothers (Achen and Bartels 2016; Kinder and Kalmoe 2017; Mason 2017).\nBeyond that, estimating the value difference between candidates\nrequires evaluating complex counterfactuals, estimating what various\ncandidates are likely to achieve, and determining what the outcomes of\nthese actions would be (Freiman 2020).\n\nThese worries aside, even if Sally is correct that D will do a\ntrillion dollars more good than R, this does not yet show it is\nrational for Sally to vote for D. Instead, this depends on how\nlikely it is that her vote will make a difference. In much the same\nway, it might be worth $200 million to win the lottery, but that does\nnot imply it is rational to buy a lottery ticket.\n\nSuppose Sally\u2019s only goal, in voting, is to change the outcome\nof the election between two major candidates. In that case, the\nexpected value of her vote (\\(U_v\\)) is: \n\n\\[\nU_v = p[V(D) - V(R)] - C\n\\]\n\n\nwhere p represents the probability that Sally\u2019s vote is\ndecisive, \\([V(D) - V(R)]\\) represents (in monetary terms) the\ndifference in the expected value of the two candidates, and C\nrepresents the opportunity cost of voting. In short, the value of her\nvote is the value of the difference between the two candidates\ndiscounted by her chance of being decisive, minus the opportunity cost\nof voting. In this way, voting is indeed like buying a lottery ticket.\nUnless \\(p[V(D) - V(R)] > C\\), then it is (given Sally\u2019s stated\ngoals) irrational for her to vote.\n\nThe equation above models the rationality of Sally\u2019s choice to\nvote under the assumption that she is simply trying to change the\noutcome of the election, and gets no further benefit from\nvoting. Further, the equation assumes her vote confers no other\nbenefit to others than having some chance of changing which candidate\nwins. However, these are controversial simplifying assumptions. It is\npossible that the choice to cast a vote may induce others to vote,\nmight improve the quality of the ground decision by adding cognitive\ndiversity, might have some marginal influence on which candidates or\nplatforms parties run, or might have some other effect not modeled in\nthe equation above.\n\nAgain, it is controversial among some philosophers whether the\ndifference in value between two candidates can be expressed, in\nprinciple, in monetary terms. Nevertheless, the point generalizes in\nsome way. If we are discussing the instrumental value of a vote, then\nthe general point is that the vote depends on the expected difference\nin value between the chosen candidate and the next best alternative,\ndiscounted by the probability of the vote breaking a tie, and we must\nthen take into account the opportunity cost of voting. For instance,\nif two candidates were identical except that one would save one more\nlife than another, but one had a 1 in 1 billion chance of being\ndecisive, and instead of voting one could save a drowning toddler,\nthen it seems voting is not worthwhile, even if we cannot assign an\nexact monetary value to thee consequences.\n\nThere is some debate among economists, political scientists, and\nphilosophers over the precise way to calculate the probability that a\nvote will be decisive. Nevertheless, they generally agree that the\nprobability that the modal individual voter in a typical election will\nbreak a tie is small. Binomial models of voting estimate the\nprobability of a vote being decisive by modeling voters as if they\nwere weighted coins and then asking what the probability is that a\nweighted coin will come up heads exactly 50% of the time. These models\ngenerally imply that the probability of being decisive, if any\ncandidate has a lead, is vanishingly small, which in turn implies that\nthe expected benefit of voting (i.e., \\(p[V(D) - V(R)]\\)) for a good\ncandidate is worth far less than a millionth of a penny (G. Brennan\nand Lomasky 1993: 56\u20137, 119). A more optimistic estimate in the\nliterature, which uses statistical estimate techniques based on past\nelections, claims that in a typical presidential election, American\nvoters have widely varying chances of being decisive depending on\nwhich state they vote in. This model still predicts that a typical\nvote in a \u201csafe\u201d states, like California, has a\nvanishingly small chance of making a difference, but suggests that\nthat a vote in very close states could have on the order of a 1 in 10\nmillion chance of breaking a tie (Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan\n2007). Thus, on both of these popular models, whether voting for the\npurpose of changing the outcome is rational depends upon the facts on\nthe ground, including how close the election is and how significant\nthe value difference is between the candidates. The binomial model\nsuggests it will almost never be rational to vote, while the\nstatistical model suggests it will be rational for voters to vote in\nsufficiently close elections or in swing states.\n\nHowever, some claim even these assessments are optimistic. One worry\nis that if a major election in most places came down to a single vote,\nthe issue might be decided in the courts after extensive lawsuits\n(Somin 2013). Further, in making such estimates, we have assumed that\nvoters can reliably identify which candidate is better and reliably\nestimate how much better that candidate is. But perhaps voters cannot.\nAfter all, showing that individual votes matter is a double-edged\nsword; the more expected good an individual vote can do, the more\nexpected harm it can do (J. Brennan 2011a; Freiman 2020). \n",
