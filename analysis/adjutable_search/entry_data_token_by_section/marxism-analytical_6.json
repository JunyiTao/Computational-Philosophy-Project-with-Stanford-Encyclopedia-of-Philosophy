    "main_text": "Form\n3. Form\n3.1. Methods\n\nIn considering the non-Marxist methods adopted by analytical Marxists,\nit is important to emphasise the plural. The variety of methods and\napproaches that analytical Marxists have adopted is striking. Nor is\nthis merely a question of the disciplinary divides mentioned above\n(between Philosophy, Politics, and Economics). Once we move beyond\ngeneralisations about clarity and precision, there is no clear\nconsensus within analytical Marxism about the merits of particular\n\u201canalytical\u201d methods and approaches.\n\nTwo examples of methodological disagreement within analytical Marxism\nare sketched here.\n3.2. Methodological Individualism\n\nThe enthusiasm of many analytical Marxists\u2014including Elster,\nPrzeworski, and Roemer\u2014for the doctrine of methodological\nindividualism is widely known. Perhaps as a result, it is sometimes\nthought that all analytical Marxists are committed to methodological\nindividualism, and that this doctrine forms a fault line between\nanalytical and other forms of Marxism. Both of these claims look\nquestionable.\n\nThe proper characterisation of \u201cmethodological\nindividualism\u201d is contested (see entry on\n methodological individualism).\n It is understood here as a methodological position which maintains\nthat all macro-level social phenomena\u2014political states, economic\nclasses, social processes, group norms, and so on\u2014are in\nprinciple reducible to micro-level explanation involving only\nindividuals and their properties (Elster 1985: 5).\n\nSo understood, methodological individualism may have fewer\nimplications than sometimes thought. For instance, there is no\nnecessary connection with rational choice explanations (see Wolff 1990). One might\nthink of the two theories as playing different roles: the first\narguing for explanations at the level of individuals; and the second\nadopting a particular model of rational action at that level (Wright,\nLevine, & Sober 1992: 126). Similarly, there is no necessary\nconnection between methodological individualism and what is sometimes\ncalled \u201catomism\u201d; namely, the claim that only\nnon-relational entities are explanatory (Wright, Levine, & Sober\n1992: 110). Methodological individualists can allow that the\nindividual characteristics considered explanatory include inherently\nrelational properties (being an \u201cemployer\u201d, for\nexample).\n\nEven so, methodological individualism remains a demanding doctrine. In\nparticular, its proponents insist on the indispensability of\nmicro-level explanations, and the desirability of dispensing with\n\u201cholist\u201d accounts. Elster, for one, characterises it as\n\u201ca form of reductionism\u201d, recommending the move from the\naggregate to the less aggregate level of phenomena (1985: 5).\n\nMethodological individualism also looks to have an historically\nuneasy, if not downright antagonistic, relation with Marxism. First,\nmany of the most enthusiastic proponents of the former were fierce\ncritics of the latter (including Friedrich von Hayek and Karl Popper).\nSecond, if pre-analytical Marxists had expressed a view about\nmethodological individualism, then it would probably have been to\nreject it (perhaps encouraged by Marx\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance of social totalities, and his scepticism about explanations\nbased on \u201cabstract individuals\u201d). Third, analytical\nMarxists have often raised methodological individualist concerns about\nMarx\u2019s own attempts at social explanation; suggesting, for\ninstance, that Marx substituted \u201cwishful thinking\u201d for\n\u201csocial analysis\u201d in his account of the dynamics of\ncommunist revolution (Elster 1988: 225).\n\nHowever, analytical Marxists have also held that, whilst Marx often\n(implicitly) denied methodological individualism, he was also\n\u201cat least intermittently\u201d committed to it. That more\npositive attitude is said to be evident, for instance, in some of his\nanti-teleological remarks in the German Ideology manuscripts\n(Elster 1985: 109). At a time when Elster insisted that \u201cmost of\nthe views\u201d that he himself held to be \u201ctrue and\nimportant\u201d could be traced back to Marx, he explicitly included\nmethodological views in that category, alongside substantive views and\nvalues (1985: 531).\n\nOther analytical Marxists\u2014including Wright, Levine, and\nSober\u2014have sought to resist the reductive ambitions of\nmethodological individualism, without embracing the position they call\n\u201cradical holism\u201d (which seeks to eliminate the individual\nlevel of analysis). Broadly speaking, the central issue\nhere\u2014between Elster on the one hand, and Wright, Levine, and\nSober on the other\u2014is whether the only good social\nexplanations are what J.W.N. Watkins calls \u201crock-bottom\u201d\nexplanations in terms of individual actions, or whether\n\u201chalf-way\u201d explanations might not also be meaningful and\nuseful (Watkins 1957: 106). For the methodological individualist, to\nexplain a social phenomenon just is to provide an account of the\nindividual level mechanism that produces it. In the absence of such an\naccount, the phenomenon remains unexplained. However, Wright, Levine,\nand Sober embrace a position they call\n\u201canti-reductionism\u201d, which denies that all\n\u201cmacro-level\u201d social explanations are in principle\nreducible to \u201cmicro-level\u201d accounts in terms of\nindividuals and their properties (1992: 115).\n\nThis line of response draws on a distinction between two distinct\nthreads in the methodological individualist position: its ontological\nclaim that all macro-level social entities are constituted by\nindividuals; and its explanatory claim that all macro-level social\nentities are ultimately explicable in terms of facts about\nindividuals. Accepting the truth of the former does not require one to\nendorse the distinctive \u201creductive\u201d ambitions of the\nlatter. And there might be good reasons for resisting the latter,\nincluding: the possibility of regularities at the macro-level which\nare not derivable from regularities at the micro-level; and\n(more pragmatically) in the existence of cases where, although it\nmight in principle be possible to perform the derivation, the\nbenefits of doing so might be extremely limited. In both cases, there\nare good reasons to preserve the \u201cexplanatory autonomy\u201d of\nthe social (Little 1991: 183\u2013195).\n\nOne kind of case which resists reduction is where there is no single\nrelation between the social phenomenon and individual properties,\nbecause the relevant macro-level phenomenon can be realised in\nmultiple ways at the micro-level. Examples might include the idea of\n\u201cfittingness\u201d in evolutionary biology, or of\n\u201ceconomic survival\u201d (of capitalist firms) in economics\n(Wright, Levine, & Sober 1992: 119). In such circumstances, no\nparticular micro-level account can be identified as explaining the\nmacro-level phenomenon, because the latter can be realised in multiple\ncombinations of the former. The provision of a micro-level account\nmight still be desirable\u2014for instance, identifying a possible\nmicro-foundation might improve our confidence in the macro-level\nexplanation\u2014but here it offers no support for a general project\nof reduction (1992: 122). In short, Wright, Levine, and Sober\nrecognise that facts about social phenomenon might supervene on facts\nabout individuals and their interaction, without it being the case\nthat all social phenomenon can be explained in individualistic terms\nalone. The question of how many social phenomenon are irreducible to\nindividual level properties looks to be an open empirical matter (List\n& Spiekermann 2013).\n\nThere are complex issues in the philosophy of social science raised\nhere, but\u2014irrespective of one\u2019s considered judgement about\nthe balance of argument\u2014these disagreements confirm that a\ncommitment to analytical methods does not require endorsement of\nmethodological individualism. Wright, Levine, and Sober, for example,\nhave all produced work within the analytical Marxist tradition and yet\nreject elements of this particular methodological doctrine.\n3.3. Functional Explanation\n\nThe methodological diversity of analytical Marxism is also apparent in\ndisagreements about the legitimacy of functional explanation in the\nsocial sciences. The initial context of this disagreement is provided\nby Cohen\u2019s Karl Marx\u2019s Theory of History. A\nDefence (1978).\n\nCohen and Elster had independently come to see that Marx, in his\ntheory of history, was, in some sense, committed to functional\nexplanation. They differ in that, whereas Elster deplores that\ncommitment and recommends an alternative game theoretic account, Cohen\ndefends this role for functional explanation and expresses scepticism\nabout the suitability of Elster\u2019s alternative (G. Cohen 2014:\n284). (Note that only some elements of their debate are covered\nhere.)\n\nCohen identifies a number of explanatory connections between the\n\u201censembles\u201d that appear in Marx\u2019s \u201c1859\nPreface\u201d: the productive forces; the relations of production;\nand the superstructure. Consider an example involving the first two of\nthose ensembles. The productive forces are those facilities and\ndevices\u2014means of production (including tools, raw materials, and\npremisses) and labour power (including strength, skill, and technical\nknowledge)\u2014used to productive effect in the process of\nproduction. They are said, on this account, to grow in power over the\ncourse of human history. And the relations of production\u2014the sum\ntotal of which are said to constitute the economic structure (or\n\u201cbase\u201d) of a given society\u2014are the relations of\npower that people enjoy, or lack, over those forces, over means of\nproduction and labour power (G. Cohen 1988: 4).\n\nIn the context of the relationship between those growing forces and\nthe relations of production (the economic structure), Marx propounds\ntwo claims which might look to be in tension with each other. First,\nthat the productive forces have explanatory primacy over the\nrelations; that is, that the level of development of the productive\nforces explains the nature of the economic structure. And second, that\nthe economic structure has considerable effect on the forces; not\nleast, that the economic structure controls (facilitates or\nfrustrates) the development of the productive forces. It is this\ncombination of claims which confirms that the \u201cfirst primacy\nthesis\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe level of development of the\nproductive forces in a society explains the nature of its economic\nstructure\u201d (G. Cohen 2014: 289)\u2014is best understood as\nfunctional in form.\n\nA functional explanation is one in which something that has an effect,\nis explained in terms of its effect. Cohen often uses an example from\nevolutionary biology to illustrate this; namely, that \u201cbirds\nhave hollow bones because hollow bones facilitate flight\u201d. Here,\nsomething (birds having hollow bones) which has a certain effect\n(facilitating flight) is explained by the fact that it has that effect\n(\u201cbirds have hollow bones because hollow bones facilitate\nflight\u201d; G. Cohen 1988: 8). In short, where e is a cause\nand f is its effect, functional explanations maintain that:\ne occurred because it would cause f. Or, more properly,\nfunctional explanations maintain that: e occurred because the\nsituation was such that an event like e would cause an event\nlike f (G. Cohen 1988: 8).\n\nFunctional explanation, so understood, renders these two\nclaims\u2014namely, that the relations of production are explained by\nthe forces of production, and that the relations of production control\nthe development of the forces of production\u2014consistent. For\ninstance, where relations of production endure (that is, exist in a\nstable fashion), they do so because they promote the\ndevelopment of the productive forces. And, where relations of\nproduction are revolutionised (that is, where old relations are\nabandoned for new ones), old relations cease to exist because\nthey no longer favour the forces, and the new relations come\ninto being (and/or come to preponderate) because they do\nfavour the forces. On this reading, the impact of the relations on the\nforces is no embarrassment to Marx\u2019s theory of history because\nof the functional manner in which it explains economic structures in\nterms of productive forces. Economic structures rise and fall\naccording to whether they sustain or frustrate the development of the\nproductive forces. To be clear, the suggestion is not, strictly\nspeaking, that Marx propounds functional explanations, but rather that\nthe claims which he does propound put severe constraints on the kind\nof explanation that is required, and that functional explanation is\nthe most plausible candidate meeting those constraints.\n\nElster takes issue with Cohen\u2019s twofold claim that, historical\nmaterialism \u201ccannot shed its commitment to functional\nexplanation\u201d, and that \u201cthere is nothing inherently\nsuspect in it\u201d (G. Cohen 2014: 294). Elster maintains that the\nconditions that justify the use of functional explanation in\nevolutionary biology do not obtain in social theory, and especially\nnot in the context of historical materialism.\n\nElster insists that functional explanations of macro-phenomena are\nmethodologically acceptable only where it is possible to indicate, at\nleast schematically, the mechanisms at the level of individual\nbehaviour through which the aggregate behaviour emerges. That is,\nmacro-explanations require what he calls\n\u201cmicrofoundations\u201d at the level of the processes of\nindividual choice and action. Indeed, it seems that\n\u201cholist\u201d social explanations are not really considered\nexplanations at all. They involve\u2014in this figuratively\nmechanistic account\u2014a black box whose internal workings are\nhidden, when to explain just: \n\n\nis to provide a mechanism, to open up the black box and show the nuts\nand bolts, the cogs and wheels, the desires and beliefs that generate\nthe aggregate outcomes. (Elster 1985: 5) \n\n\nIn this context, Elster recommends that Marxism abandon\n(insufficiently supported) functional explanation and utilise game\ntheoretic explanation in its place.\n\nIn response, Cohen makes two broad points.\n\nFirst, Cohen maintains that, whilst providing\n\u201cmicrofoundations\u201d\u2014what he prefers to call\n\u201celaborations\u201d of a functional mechanism\u2014would\nimprove a functional explanation, their absence does not necessarily\ninvalidate it. The nineteenth-century Darwinian claim that birds have\nhollow bones because hollow bones facilitate flight, for example, was\nalready an \u201cexcellent\u201d explanation, which was subsequently\nrendered \u201ceven better\u201d through twentieth-century\ndevelopments in the science of genetics (G. Cohen 1988: 12).\nMarx\u2019s theory of history might be figuratively located at an\nanalogous position to that not-yet-fully-elaborated Darwinian\nstage.\n\nSecond, Cohen judges the proposal to replace functional explanation\nwith game theoretic accounts as an unpromising one. Whilst game theory\ncan provide imaginative accounts of aspects of class struggle\u2014of\nalliances and revolution, for instance\u2014class struggle is not the\nmost basic of the phenomena that historical materialism is trying to\nexplain. For Marxists, \u201cclass struggle has primary political\nsignificance, but the political dimension of society is not itself\nprimary\u201d (G. Cohen 1988: 17). Game theory might help explain the\nimmediate outcome of various political struggles, but whether those\noutcomes stick, or not, is explained by the material conditions in\nwhich they take place.\n\nAgain, there are complex issues in the philosophy of social science\nraised here, but\u2014irrespective of one\u2019s considered\njudgement about the balance of argument\u2014this dispute confirms\nthat analytical Marxism is home to disagreement and debate about\nparticular methods.\n3.4. Dialectic\n\nCommentators sometimes claim that analytical Marxism holds an\nunremittingly negative view of \u201cdialectic\u201d, with one\nsuggesting that: \n\n\na good test to follow if in doubt whether a particular writer supports\nthe analytic school is to see whether he mentions dialectics with\nfavour. If he does, he must immediately be crossed off the list. Even\nto cite the word at all counts against membership in the analytic\nschool. (Gordon 1990: 22\u20133.)\n\n\nBoth that claim and this test are rejected here. (This section draws on Leopold\n2008.)\n\nAnalytical Marxists share the negative methodological view that there\nis no distinctive Marxist method, no valuable tools and approaches\nwhich are available only to Marxists. That view is perhaps most likely\nto be resisted by \u201cHegelian Marxists\u201d who identify\nthe Marxist method with some variety of dialectic. However,\nit does not follow that analytical Marxists have to reject all talk of\ndialectic. (There is, of course, also a potential irony in the\nhostility of Hegelian Marxists to the embrace of non-Marxist methods\nby analytical Marxists, given that their own preferred method\npresumably owes much to its eponymous \u201cbourgeois\u201d\nsource.)\n\nMany of the best-known analytical Marxists are proponents of what can\nbe called modest conceptions of dialectic. Consider, for\nexample, Elster\u2019s account of three dialectical strands in\nMarx\u2019s work, of which two are judged valuable (Elster 1978:\nchapters 3\u20135; Elster 1985: 37\u201348; and Elster 1986a:\n34\u201339).\n\nThe first, and wholly unpromising, strand concerns dialectic as a\nmethod of presentation. In parts of the Grundrisse\n(1986\u201387 [1857\u201358]) and Capital (1996 [1867]),\nfor instance, Marx appears to adopt a \u201cquasi-deductive\nprocedure\u201d, presenting certain results of his economic analysis\nin a manner analogous to the developing categorical system of\nHegel\u2019s science of logic. Elster is deeply unsympathetic to this\nmethod of presentation, purporting to find, both the relevant\npassages, and their underlying motivation, scarcely intelligible\n(1985: 37). (For a more positive account, see Arthur 2004.)\n\nThe second, and modestly promising, strand concerns the\n\u201cdialectical laws\u201d, associated with Friedrich Engels, but\nalso found in Marx\u2019s own work. In Engels\u2019 famous\nformulations, these \u201claws\u201d include: the \u201cnegation of\nthe negation\u201d; the \u201ctransformation of quantity into\nquality\u201d; and the \u201cinterpenetration of opposites\u201d.\nElster scales down the status and explanatory reach of Engels\u2019\naccount, suggesting that, rather than indicating laws of nature, we\nthink of these terms as describing \u201cnot infrequent patterns of\nchange\u201d sometimes found in nature, society, and consciousness\n(1985: 40). There is no suggestion that all developments, in those\nvarious contexts, follow such patterns, and their extent is treated as\nan open empirical question. However, with those, and other, cautions\nin place, Elster suggests that these imprecise but suggestive ideas\ncan be illuminating.\n\nFor example, the \u201cnegation of the negation\u201d describes the\nthird step of a triadic development from a stage of\n\u201cundifferentiated unity\u201d (where some subject is undivided\nfrom some object), through a stage of \u201cdifferentiated\ndisunity\u201d (where that subject is divided from the object in a\nmanner which creates discord), to a stage of \u201cdifferentiated\nunity\u201d (where the distinction between subject and object remains\nbut harmony between them is restored). Analytical Marxists are happy\nto allow that certain social and individual developments exhibit this\ndialectical pattern. Cohen, for instance, describes a historical\ndevelopment from pre-capitalist society, where collective structures\nand consciousness inhibit individualism (a stage of undifferentiated\nunity), through the divisions of capitalism, which stimulate an\nunbridled individualism and undermine community (a stage of\ndifferentiated disunity), to a communist future, which will preserve\n(aspects of) individuality in a context of regained community (a stage\nof differentiated unity). Note that society is said to undergo a\ndialectical transformation here simply by virtue of experiencing the\nrelevant stages in turn. There is no suggestion of the development\nbeing a necessary one, of each stage having to generate the next\n(G. Cohen 1988: 185).\n\nThe third, and most promising, of the three dialectical strands is a\ntheory of social contradictions. Elster sees Marx as a pioneer in the\nstudy of \u201creal contradictions\u201d; that is, situations in\n(psychological or social) reality which can only be described in terms\nof logical contradiction. The core idea here involves a contrast\nbetween the local and the global, between what is possible for a\nparticular social agent and what is possible for all agents in that\nsocial position. This core idea is judged both clear (impervious to\nsome standard \u201canalytical\u201d objections to dialectical talk)\nand fertile (operationalizable and capable of generating substantive\nsocial scientific results).\n\nElster outlines two variants of social contradiction:\n\u201ccounterfinality\u201d and \u201csuboptimality\u201d. Only\nthe former is discussed here. Broadly speaking, counterfinality refers\nto the discrepancy between individual intentions and actual results\nwhich obtains when each individual acts upon non-universalizable\nbeliefs about the behaviour of others (see Van Parijs 1982, 592). In\nwhat Elster calls \u201ccondensed jargon\u201d, counterfinality can\nbe described as \u201cthe embodiment of the fallacy of\ncomposition\u201d (1985: 44). Consider the following example of the\ncontradictory character of capitalist behaviour. In response, say, to\nsome exogenously induced fall in demand, each individual capitalist\nreduces their own workers\u2019 wages in order to maintain profits. The\naggregative result, contrary to that intention, is a further reduction\nof workers\u2019 buying power (and thus a further reduction also of\nprofits). Any capitalist might have succeeded were they the only one\nto act, but when they all act in this way they fail (Elster 1985: 46).\nThese desires taken together are contradictory, in the sense that\nthere is no possible world in which all capitalists can have that\ndesire satisfied. Given certain structural contexts, those social\ncontradictions can cause social change; for instance, in certain\ncases, generating collective action (perhaps including state\nintervention) designed to overcome or mitigate those\ncontradictions.\n\nThere is no suggestion that only Marxists can identify or appreciate\nthese two kinds of modest dialectic. For instance, there is an\ninteresting parallel of \u201cthe negation of the negation\u201d in\nAlexis de Tocqueville\u2019s account of three \u201cdistinct and\noften successive\u201d stages in the relation between an individual\nand religious belief (see Tocqueville 1835\u201340 [1994: 187]). And\nElster (1978: 106) notes that the concept of counterfinality was\ndeveloped by an intellectually highly diverse group of, both early\nproponents (Bossuet, Mandeville, Vico, Adam Smith, Hegel, and Marx),\nand more recent defenders (Oskar Morgenstern, Jean-Paul Sartre, Robert\nNozick, and Trygve Haavelmo).\n\nFinally, no support is offered here to those insisting on the\nexistence of a radical gulf between \u201cdialectical\u201d and\n\u201canalytical\u201d reasoning. The explicit assumption is that\ndialectical talk can make analytic sense. Indeed, as Cohen remarks, in\na slightly more aggressive formulation, the idea that belief in\ndialectic is a rival to analysis \u201cthrives only in an\natmosphere of unclear thought\u201d (G. Cohen 2000b: xxiii).\n\nThese modest conceptions will, of course, be too modest for some, but\nthey confirm that analytical Marxism does not reject the very idea of\ndialectic.\n4. Content\n4.1 Marxist Substance\n\nIt is the substantive concerns of analytical Marxism which\u2014along\nwith its normative commitments\u2014are said to embody its Marxist\nheritage (by comparison with its adoption of non-Marxist methods).\n\nThis section outlines some aspects of analytical Marxist treatments\nof: historical explanation; class structure; and exploitation.\n4.2 History\n\nThe present section sketches some aspects of Cohen\u2019s account of\nhistorical materialism (1978), and of his subsequent reflections on\nthe explanatory scope of that theory (1988: 155\u2013179).\n\nMarx is said to understand history as, fundamentally, the growth of\nhuman productive power, maintaining that forms of society, which are\norganised around economic structures, \u201crise and fall according\nas they enable and promote, or prevent and discourage, that\ngrowth\u201d (G. Cohen 1988: 3). The canonical text for this\ninterpretation being Marx\u2019s \u201c1859 Preface\u201d to A\nContribution to the Critique of Political Economy, which is\ntreated not as one piece of evidence amongst many, but as the text\nproviding the clearest theoretical statement of historical\nmaterialism.\n\nCohen presents Marx as committed to the following claims, amongst\nothers:\n\nFirst, the Development Thesis: which claims that the productive\nforces have an autonomous tendency to develop throughout history. The\nproductive forces are those facilities and devices\u2014means of\nproduction (including tools, raw materials, and premisses) and labour\npower (including strength, skill, and technical knowledge)\u2014used\nto productive effect in the process of production. Growth here can be\nmeasured by the decreasing amount of labour it takes with given forces\nto produce what is necessary to satisfy the basic physical needs of\nthe immediate producers.\nSecond, the First Primacy Thesis: which claims that the level of\ndevelopment of the productive forces in a given society explains the\neconomic structure (the set of relations of production) that obtain in\nthat society. The relations of production\u2014the sum total of which\nare said to constitute the economic structure (or \u201cbase\u201d)\nof a given society\u2014are the relations of power that people enjoy,\nor lack, over the productive forces, over means of production and\nlabour power (G. Cohen 1988: 4).\nThird, the Second Primacy Thesis: which claims that the\n\u201cbase\u201d, understood as the economic structure of a given\nsociety, explains the legal and political \u201csuperstructure\u201d\nin that society. \nFourth, the claim that the kind of explanation involved in both of\nthese two Primacy Theses is functional explanation (see\n section 3.3).\n\n\nTo put a little flesh on those abstract bones, consider the following\nelaboration of the First Primacy Thesis (Wright, Levine, & Sober\n1992: 19). A given level of development of the productive forces is\nonly compatible with a certain type (or with limited types) of\neconomic structure. Since forces of production tend to develop over\ntime (see the \u201cDevelopment Thesis\u201d), the forces eventually\nreach a level where they are no longer compatible with the relations\nof production under which they had previously developed. When such\nincompatibilities arise, the relations are said to\n\u201cfetter\u201d the development of the forces of production (G.\nCohen 1988: 109\u2013123). This fettering leads to revolution, in\nwhich social actors (classes) with the capacity to bring new relations\ninto effect emerge, and revolutionise the economic structure in ways\nthat restores growth in the productive forces.\n\nThis model of growing levels of productive power, and their associated\nforms of society, is said to generate a four-stage periodisation of\nprogressive epochs in human history (G. Cohen 1978: 197\u2013201). In\nthe first stage, the material position involves an absence of surplus,\nand the corresponding social form is a primitive classless society\n(productive power being too low to enable a class of non-producers to\nlive off the labour of producers). In the second stage, the material\nposition is a surplus large enough to support an exploiting class, but\ntoo small to sustain capitalist accumulation, and the corresponding\nsocial form is a pre-capitalist class society. In the third stage, the\nmaterial surplus is moderately high\u2014high enough to support\ncapitalist accumulation\u2014and the corresponding social form is\ncapitalist class society. Capitalism subsequently generates a growing\nsurplus such that it becomes itself unsustainable (for contested\nreasons), leading to a fourth and final stage, where, on the basis of\na precondition of a massive surplus, a modern classless society\nemerges.\n\nSuch an abbreviated summary ignores many interesting complexities and\nchanges in Cohen\u2019s views, but hopefully give some sense of its\ncharacter as a defence of a \u201ctraditional\u201d, even\n\u201cold-fashioned\u201d, conception of historical materialism\nattaching explanatory primacy to the forces of production (G. Cohen\n1978: x).\n\nThere is a huge critical literature on Cohen\u2019s reading of\nMarx\u2019s theory of history. A thorough survey is scarcely possible\nhere, but most criticisms tend to cluster around three main kinds of\nconcern.\n\nFirst, there are criticisms based on Cohen\u2019s treatment of what\nmight be called textual issues. For example, there is some\nsuspicion of what is seen as his over-reliance on the\n\u201c1859 Preface\u201d (critics sometimes utilising Printz\n1969). Or, to give another example, there are appeals to the lack of\nfit between Cohen\u2019s interpretation and some of the more concrete\naccounts of historical development found elsewhere in Marx\u2019s own\nwritings (Miller 1984: 188\u2013195).\n\nSecond, there are criticisms pressing on coherence issues arising from\nCohen\u2019s reconstruction of Marx\u2019s theory. For example,\nthere is some scepticism about whether the \u201cbase\u201d can be\ndistinguished from the \u201csuperstructure\u201d in the way that he\nrequires (F. Cohen & Acton 1970; Lukes 1982). Or, to give another\nexample, whether Cohen\u2019s distinction between social and material\nproperties is conceptually flawed in ways that undermine his claims\nabout the primacy of the productive forces (Coram 1989).\n\nThird, there are criticisms examining the empirical truth of\nthis account of Marx\u2019s theory. For example, there are doubts\nabout whether the historical record of pre-capitalist\nsocieties\u2014especially given cases such as the \u201clong\nperiod\u201d in Chinese history, or the \u201csecond serfdom\u201d\nin Poland\u2014offer support for the claim that there is little\nproductive regression in history (J. Cohen 1982: 266\u2013268). In\naddition, some historians are sceptical of whether, given\npre-capitalist relations, economic actors have the relevant incentives\nto act in the ways\u2014especially, in transforming property\nrelations\u2014that Cohen\u2019s theory seems to require (Brenner\n1985a, 1985b, and 1986). Or, to give a final empirical example, as\npart of a wider insistence that Cohen\u2019s early work is flawed by\nits lack of gender awareness, Paula Casal argues that his four-stage\nperiodisation of epochs (and associated producers) cannot survive\nserious reflection on the economic position of women (2020).\n\nThese, and many other, critical questions are not pursued further\nhere. Instead, the remainder of the section considers the explanatory\nscope of historical materialism.\n\nCohen accepts that Marx\u2019s theory makes some large and\ncontroversial claims, but comes to think that these may be less\ndemanding than is often thought. Cohen distinguishes two\ninterpretations of historical materialism. On an inclusive\nreading, the theory claims that material and economic developments\nexplain the principal features of other, non-economic developments.\nHowever, on a restricted reading, the theory commits itself\nto explaining non-economic phenomena only when, if they weren\u2019t\nso explained, they would seem to control material development. The\ntheory, on this \u201crestricted\u201d reading, limits itself to\nexplaining non-economic phenomena which possess \u201ceconomic\nrelevance\u201d (G. Cohen 1988: 173). It seems likely that Marx and\nEngels\u2014perhaps under the influence of Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nof history\u2014assumed an inclusive reading, but Cohen suggests that\nthe restricted reading is consistent with the \u201c1859\nPreface\u201d, and may offer a better fit with historical\nevidence.\n\nAn example can illuminate the difference between these two readings\n(G. Cohen 1988: 160\u2013165). Assume that the following increasingly\nWeberian-looking claims are all true: first, that Protestantism took\nhold and persisted for non-economic reasons; second, that\nProtestantism had important consequences for European religious life;\nand, third, that Protestantism had important consequence for European\neconomic life. Note that inclusive historical materialism is\nchallenged by both the conjunction of the first two claims, and the\nthird claim; whereas restricted historical materialism is challenged\nonly by the addition of the third claim to the first two. Moreover, on\nCohen\u2019s functionalist account, the latter can meet that\nchallenge: \n\n\nif the features of Protestantism in virtue of which it had economic\neffects arose because of their tendency to have such effects. (1988:\n176)\n\n\nCohen was subsequently persuaded (by Wright) that this distinction\nbetween restricted and inclusive historical materialism is\nbetter understood in the light of a \u201cprior\ndistinction\u201d between Marxist theory of history and Marxist\nsociology (G. Cohen 1988: 176\u2013177). Marxist theory of history is\nidentified with the restricted variant, and the familiar Marxist\nclaims that the latter refrained from affirming (about the economic\nexplaining the principal features of non-economic life) are now\nallocated to Marxist sociology. Where Marxist theory of history is\nconcerned with the issue of how social formations succeed one another,\nMarxist sociology is concerned with how the elements within a social\nformation are related. The latter, but not the former, insists that\nnon-economic structures and modes of consciousness are, in their broad\noutlines, explained by material and economic factors. The two theories\nare often conflated, but they are sufficiently distinct that they\nrequire independent assessment (G. Cohen 1988: 178).\n4.3 Class\n\nThe concept of class is central to the Marxist tradition. Of course,\nmany non-Marxist thinkers\u2014including Ricardo, Weber, Durkheim,\nand Bourdieu\u2014also utilise some idea of class, but it is\ntypically conceptualised differently, and allocated a less important\nrole in their social theory. For Marxists, class is standardly defined\nin an \u201cobjective\u201d manner, and designates the social\nposition occupied by individuals within a network of relations of\nproduction. Indeed, an objective account is necessary if certain\nMarxist claims about the ways in which class conditions and shapes\n\u201cconsciousness, culture, or politics\u201d are to be sustained\n(G. Cohen 1978: 73). And class, so understood, typically plays a\ncrucial explanatory part in Marxist accounts of, variously: the\ncharacter of, and development between, historical epochs; the\ninstitutional form, and behaviour, of the state; and many of the\nbeliefs, and actions, of individual and collective agents.\n\nClass is a recurring topic in analytical Marxist writings. Examples\ninclude: Wright\u2019s account of the \u201cmiddle class \u201d;\nPrzeworski\u2019s analysis of the class basis of social democracy\n(1985); Roemer\u2019s discussion of the relationship between class\nposition and exploitation status (1982); and Alan Carling\u2019s game\ntheoretic portrayal of relations between men and women as class\nrelations (1991: 253\u2013299). This section outlines some aspects of\nthe first of those examples.\n\nWright has written at least five books on the subject, changed his\nviews over time, and collaborated in extensive empirical work using\nmodern sample survey methodology and multivariate statistical\ntechniques across countries (Wright 1989). This section only touches\non: the Marxist character of Wright\u2019s view of class structure;\nhis early response to the problem of \u201cthe middle class\u201d;\nand his revised understanding of the relation between exploitation and\nclass.\n\nWright identifies six \u201cconceptual constraints\u201d that\ndiverse Marxist approaches to class\u2014including his\nown\u2014typically respect (1985: 26\u201337). First, that the class\nstructure of a society is the \u201cbasic\u201d determinant (1985:\n28) of the limits of possible variation in class formations, class\nconsciousness, and class struggle. Second, that class structures\nconstitute the central organising principle of societies, shaping the\npossible variations of \u201cthe state, ethnic relations, gender\nrelations, etc.\u201d, and offering the best way of identifying\nhistorical epochs (1985: 31). Third, that the concept of class is a\nrelational one, classes are defined within social relations, and\nespecially by their relation to other classes (to be a feudal serf,\nfor instance, is to stand in a certain relation to a feudal lord).\nFourth, that the social relations which define classes are\nintrinsically antagonistic; that is, classes have conflicting\ninterests, between which compromise or accommodation\u2014but not\nharmony\u2014is possible. Fifth, that the objective basis of those\nantagonistic relations is exploitation (Marxists do not, for instance,\nmerely claim that lords are rich and serfs are poor, but insist rather\nthat the former are rich because they appropriate a surplus produced\nby the latter). Sixth, and finally, that the fundamental basis of\nexploitation is located in the social organisation of production,\nnotwithstanding disagreements about how to locate classes within\nrelations of production (whether, for instance, ideology, property,\ncontrol, or something else, are crucial). The last four of these\nconstraints can be said to elaborate the structural properties of the\nMarxist concept of class.\n\nWright\u2019s best-known early contribution to class\nanalysis\u2014his model of \u201ccontradictory class\nlocations\u201d\u2014is preoccupied with theorising the class\ncharacter of \u201cthe middle class\u201d within a Marxist\nframework. The context here is the seeming tension between modern\nhistorical developments and the classical Marxist idea of capitalist\nsociety as increasingly composed of two hostile camps (capitalists and\nproletarians) with any third class (the\n\u201cpetit-bourgeoisie\u201d) as \u201ctransitional\u201d in\nnature (on its way to being squeezed out by the other two). That claim\nabout a pervasive tendency towards class polarisation would appear to\nconflict with the huge growth of professional, managerial, technical,\nand bureaucratic positions, in both modern corporations and modern states\n(Wright 1985: 7\u20139). The resulting \u201cproblem of the middle\nclass\u201d raises issues, not only about the accuracy of received\nMarxist accounts of class structure, but also about the sociological\nplausibility of their associated accounts of class formation, class\nconsciousness, and class struggle (since these newer groups do not\nobviously share the interests and attitudes of traditional\nproletarians).\n\nWright rejects Marxist responses which either deny the gap between the\npolarisation account and empirical reality, or assimilate these new\nsocial groups to the petit-bourgeoisie. Instead, his own early\napproach abandons the assumption that the class locations of\nindividuals are mapped in a one-to-one relation to the actual class\nstructure of capitalism. Rather than assuming that individuals are\nonly ever capitalist, petit-bourgeois, or proletarian, Wright suggests\nthat some occupy positions that have \u201ca multiple class\ncharacter; they may be in more than one class simultaneously\u201d\n(1985: 43). Those individuals occupy \u201ccontradictory class\nlocations\u201d; or, more precisely, \u201ccontradictory locations\nwithin contradictory class relations\u201d.\n\nWright\u2019s earliest attempts to operationalise this increasingly\ndifferentiated account of the class structure of contemporary\ncapitalism focuses on whether individuals are self-employed, and\nwhether they supervise the labour of others. This resulted in a\nsimplified typology which added \u201cmanagers\u201d to the three\noriginal Marxist classes (capitalists, petit-bourgeoisie, and\nproletariat). His subsequent work further differentiated these new\nsocial groups on the basis of the extent of individual control (full,\npartial, minimal, or none) over money capital, physical capital, and\nlabour within production. The resulting contradictory class locations\nnow included: managers (simultaneously bourgeois and proletarian);\nnon-managerial technical/professional staff (simultaneously\npetty-bourgeois and proletarian); and small employers (simultaneously\nbourgeois and petty-bourgeois). By 1979, Wright had a schematic\ntypology that added five contradictory class locations to the three\noriginal Marxist classes (Wright 1985: 48 figure 2.2).\n\nAfter 1979, Wright\u2019s account evolved significantly in response\nto criticisms, especially from Roemer. Wright now criticised his own\nearlier view for emphasising domination, and downplaying exploitation.\nExploitation is understood here as diagnosing the ways in which income\ninequalities are generated by inequalities in rights and powers over\nproductive resources; that is, the ways in which: \n\n\nexploiters, by virtue of their exclusionary rights and powers over\nresources, are able to appropriate surplus generated by the efforts of\nthe exploited. (Wright 2005b: 17) \n\n\nThis new account resulted in a typology in which ownership and\nnon-ownership of means of production are complicated by effective\ncontrol of \u201corganisation assets\u201d and \u201ccredential\nassets\u201d, both of which can constitute a strategic basis for\ngenerating higher incomes. Some of the resulting class locations are\noccupied by individuals who are both exploited in one dimension\n(because they don\u2019t own or control capital), and exploiters in\nanother (because they can leverage their organisational and credential\nassets in the relevant ways). Wright\u2019s new typology of class\nlocations has twelve categories: three types of owner of means of\nproduction (differentiated by their amount of capital); and nine\nvarieties of wage-earner (differentiated by organisation and\ncredential assets). The latter group contains a wide range of class\nlocations distinct from proletarians proper, including expert\nmanagers, expert non-managers, semi-credentialled supervisors, and\nmore (Wright 1985: 88 table 3.3).\n\nCritics have acknowledged Wright\u2019s theoretical ingenuity, but\nsometimes identified a gradational neo-Weberian account of\nstratification as really doing the work here, only partially concealed\nbehind Marxist rhetoric about exploitation (Mayer 1994: 137). Wright\nconcedes the similarity of appearances here\u2014in particular, the\nshared focus on the ways in which class determines \u201clife\nchances\u201d\u2014but insists on the distinctiveness of the two\ntheoretical frameworks. The Marxist character of his own account is\nsaid to rest on the central role of exploitation\u2014and the\ndistribution of the rights and powers of individuals over productive\nresources\u2014in determining the distribution of income and economic\nactivities (Wright 2005b: 16\u201319).\n\nFinally, Wright also identifies possible continuities with his earlier\nviews. The idea of the \u201cmiddle classes\u201d occupying\n\u201ccontradictory locations\u201d is perhaps preserved in the idea\nof those individuals having interests that conflict with both capital\nand labour (Wright 1985: 87). The relevant groups are like workers in\nthat they are excluded from ownership of the means of production, but\nthey also have interests opposed to workers because of their effective\ncontrol of organisational and credential assets.\n4.4 Exploitation\n\nExploitation is a highly contested concept. This section is intended\nonly to introduce some aspects of its treatment by analytical Marxism,\nand not to rule out alternative usages.\n\nThe basic concept of exploitation involves some agent benefitting from\nsocial interaction with another by taking advantage of that other,\nsometimes (interestingly) in ways that are both mutually beneficial\nand consensual (A. Wood 1995: 151). Of course, not all kinds of\n\u201ctaking advantage\u201d are morally problematic. To give a\nstandard example: there may be nothing wrong with a chess grandmaster\nexploiting a weakness in their opponent\u2019s endgame. Consequently,\nwe might want to avoid \u201cmoralised\u201d definitions of\n\u201cexploitation\u201d which make it wrongful or unjust by\ndefinition. That said, cases of \u201cwrongful exploitation\u201d\nare of particular significance in the Marxist tradition, often being\ntreated as providing a reason for seeking to replace capitalist\neconomic arrangements with non-exploitative alternatives.\n\nMarxist claims about exploitation are often said\u2014by both\nMarxists and their critics\u2014to depend on the labour theory of\nvalue. This is denied by Cohen who, in a well-known article, argues\nthat the relation between the two, despite their long historical\nassociation, is one of mutual irrelevance (1988: 209). The labour\ntheory of value is understood here as a theory of equilibrium price,\nwhose central claim is that magnitude of value is determined by\nsocially necessary labour time. Cohen suggests that those Marxists who\nhave insisted on the labour theory as the basis of exploitation have\nconfused the idea of producers creating value with the idea of\nproducers creating that which has value (the product). This latter,\nsomewhat simpler, idea is the real basis of the charge of\nexploitation. What matters for exploitation is not that capitalists\nappropriate value created by workers, but rather that they appropriate\n(part of) the value of what the worker produces.\n\nIn the place of arguments that make exploitation claims depend on the\nlabour theory of value, Cohen endorses the \u201cPlain\nArgument\u201d (1988: 228):\n\nThe labourer is the person who creates the product, that which has\nvalue.\nThe capitalist appropriates some of the value of the product.\nThe labourer receives less value than the value of what she\ncreates,\n\n\nand\n\nThe capitalist appropriates some of the value of what the labourer\ncreates.\nThe labourer is exploited by the capitalist.\n\n\nIt is this Plain Argument which is said typically to motivate\nMarxists, whatever their official view of the labour theory of\nvalue.\n\nNote that the claim that the capitalist appropriates part of the value\nof the worker\u2019s product (step 4) is not (as it stands) a\nnormative one. For that appropriation to constitute wrongful\nexploitation the normative dimensions of the step from 4 to 5 in the\nPlain Argument would need to be fleshed out. The present section\noutlines three candidate explanations of the relevant\nwrongfulness\u2014involving the ideas of unfairness,\ninstrumentalising vulnerability, and domination,\nrespectively\u2014which have found support within analytical\nMarxism.\n\nThe first, and best-known, analytical Marxist account maintains that\nwrongful exploitation rests on the capitalist benefitting from prior\nunfairness, in particular, benefitting from the injustice of\nproperty relations. (This account is associated with Roemer, amongst\nothers, but note that many additional issues raised by the\nlatter\u2019s innovative work on exploitation\u2014for instance, his\naccount of socialist exploitation resting on unequal ownership of\nproductive skills\u2014are not discussed here (see Roemer 1982, 1986b,\n1986c, 1988).)\n\nRoemer develops a general theory of exploitation;\n\u201cgeneral\u201d, not least, in aiming to capture both Marxist\nand neoclassical accounts within the same framework. He proposes that\na group is exploited \u201cif it has some conditionally feasible\nalternative under which its members would be better off\u201d (1986c:\n103). Formally this involves specifying a game played by coalitions of\nagents in an economy, and specifying payoffs if they withdraw.\n\nWe can say that capitalist exploitation obtains when capitalists are\nmade better off by the existence of workers, but workers are made\nworse off by the existence of capitalists (Roemer 1996: 40). More\nprecisely, capitalists exploit workers if and only if the following\nthree conditions obtain. First, if workers were to withdraw from the\nsociety, endowed with their per capita share of society\u2019s\nalienable property (including means of production) then workers would\nbe better off (in terms of income and leisure) than they are at the\npresent allocation. Second, if capitalists were to withdraw under the\nsame conditions, then capitalists would be worse off (in terms of\nincome and leisure) than they are at present (because some of their\ncurrent share would go to workers). Third, if workers were to withdraw\nfrom society with their own endowments (not their per capita share),\nthen capitalists would be worse off than at present (because they\nwould no longer be able to benefit from the workers\u2019\nlabour).\n\nFor Roemer, exploitation as such is not morally\nobjectionable. In an adjacent context (1988: 129\u2013130), he\ndescribes a two-person economy where a fair initial distribution of\nresources, but differing preferences for work and leisure: X\nprefers to work hard and defer consumption while Y prefers\nleisure and immediate consumption, which results in X being\nable to hire Y under conditions such that (a) X is made\nbetter off by this arrangement, (b) Y is not made worse off by\nthis arrangement; (c) Y could have freely chosen not to enter\ninto this arrangement; and (d) Y is exploited by X in\nthat X appropriates some of the labour time of Y. In\nexamples like these, Roemer maintains, exploitation exists but does\nnot appear morally objectionable or unjust.\n\nFor Roemer, exploitation is best understood as the distributive result\nof inequalities in the distribution of productive assets and\nresources. It is unjust only where it results from a prior\ninjustice in the underlying distribution of those assets and resources\n(Roemer 1996: 96). He consequently recommends that Marxists should\ndrop their traditional focus on the micro level of the relationship\nbetween classes in production, and attend rather to the macro level of\nthe distribution of property in society. It is unjust\ndistribution\u2014specifically, the unjust capitalist monopoly of\neffective control of the means of production\u2014that generates (the\nsecondary phenomenon of) unjust capitalist exploitation, and which\nshould be the primary locus of any normative concern.\n\nOne critical concern about this account is that, although the existing\ncapitalist monopoly over the means of production may have come about\nin a morally problematic way (not least, through violence and theft),\nwe can at least imagine (perhaps having read Nozick 1974) a capitalism\nwith a morally clean origin story, where the same inequalities emerge\nfrom a just starting point and just subsequent steps (involving,\nperhaps, voluntary choices and the right kind of luck). In such\ncircumstances, Roemer\u2019s three conditions might be met, but, on\nhis own account, there looks to be nothing wrongful about the result.\nThis might appear a surprising result in a Marxist account of\nexploitation, and is perhaps indicative of a wider problem.\n\nIn this context, consider the paradigmatic example of exploitation\nsuggested by Nicholas Vrousalis (2013: 148); namely \u201cthe pit\ncase\u201d:\n\n\nA finds B in a pit that B cannot exit unaided.\nA can get B out at little cost or difficulty. A\noffers to get B out, but only if B agrees to pay a\nmillion euros, or to sign a sweatshop contract with A. B\nsigns the contract.\n\n\nWe do not seem to require to know how B came to be in the\npit\u2014whether, for instance, it was through just or unjust\nsteps\u2014in order to assess the offer as wrongfully exploitative.\nIt seems enough to notice that A could easily rescue B\nwithout asking for anything, but instead takes advantage of\nB\u2019s vulnerability in order to improve their own lot\n(Vrousalis 2013: 149). By analogy, asset injustice does not look to be\na necessary condition for wrongful exploitation.\n\nA second analytical Marxist account maintains that wrongful\nexploitation rests on capitalists enriching themselves by taking\nadvantage of the vulnerability of workers. (This model is\nsuggested by some of Wood\u2019s writings on exploitation (see\nespecially 1995).)\n\nWood maintains that exploitation in general \u201cconsists in the\nexploiter\u201ds using something about the person for the\nexploiter\u2019s ends by playing on some weakness or vulnerability in\nthat person\u2019 (1995: 147). And he acknowledges that, so\nunderstood, exploitation is not always wrongful (as, for instance, in\ncases like the previously mentioned chess grandmaster).\n\nExploitation is wrongful, on this account, when exploiters enrich\nthemselves by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the exploited.\nThe wrongfulness here seems to involve the instrumental treatment of\nothers in ways which are humiliating or disrespectful. Wood maintains\nthat: \n\n\nProper respect for others is violated when we treat their\nvulnerabilities as opportunities to advance our own interests or\nprojects. It is degrading to have your weaknesses taken advantage of,\nand dishonourable to use the weakness of others for your ends. (1995:\n150\u2013151)\n\n\nThe relation between capitalist and worker would appear to exemplify\nthis account of wrongful exploitation. The vulnerability here arises\nfrom the workers\u2019 propertyless condition, which compels them to\nsell their labour power in terms advantageous to the capitalist. This\nstructural feature of the capitalist economy is not fundamentally\naltered, and only lightly mitigated, by the existence of some\ncollective bargaining and government regulation (A. Wood 1995:\n155). (Note that \u201cwrongful exploitation\u201d here might, or\nmight not, constitute an injustice on Wood\u2019s account.)\n\nOne critical concern about this pure vulnerability account is that it\nmight look too expansive; that is, it might look liable to indicate\nfalsely that exploitation is present in particular cases. It might,\nfor example, seem committed to the claim that a cancer doctor, who\nmakes a very comfortable living out of treating the seriously ill,\nnecessarily exploits their patients (Arneson 2016: 10). Those who\nhesitate to endorse that claim may seek to resist such\nimplications.\n\nA third analytical Marxist account treats the instrumentalization of\nvulnerability as a necessary but not sufficient condition for wrongful\nexploitation. The additional condition for exploitation to obtain is\nthat this instrumentalization of vulnerability occurs in a manner\nwhich involves domination. (This model is suggested in some of\nWood\u2019s writings on exploitation (1972, 2014), as well as in work by\nVrousalis (2013, 2016).)\n\nOn this domination account, it is the abuse of power that is the real\nwrong-making feature of exploitation; exploitation is paradigmatically\n\u201cdomination for self-enrichment\u201d (Vrousalis 2013: 131).\nThe relevant kind of domination obtains when the exploiter either\ninflicts some \u201cpower-induced injury\u201d to the status of the\nexploited, or imposes some \u201cservitude\u201d on the part of the\nexploited (Vrousalis 2016: 3). This refinement appears to address the\ncritical concern about the expansiveness of the pure vulnerability\naccount; for instance, domination looks to be missing in the case of\nthe cancer doctor and patient, but present in the relation between\nA and B in the case of the pit.\n\nTo be clear, the present account is intended to give some introductory\nsense of an ongoing debate about whether unfairness, the\ninstrumentalization of vulnerability, or domination, are at the heart\nof wrongful exploitation. There is no suggestion here that any\nconsensus about the precise character of exploitation has emerged\nwithin analytical Marxism.\n5. Socialism\n5.1 Embracing Design\n\nAnalytical Marxists have typically broken with Marx\u2019s\n\u201cutopophobia\u201d, rejecting his view that providing detailed\ndescriptions of the socialist future is undemocratic, impossible, and\nunnecessary (Leopold 2016). Instead, analytical Marxists have embraced\nthe need for socialist design, and explicitly sought to develop\ncoherent and credible accounts: first, of the values of socialism;\nsecond, of the institutional, and other, arrangements which might best\nembody and promote those values; and third, of the forms that a\ntransition to those alternatives to capitalism might take (Elster\n& Moene 1989).\n\nThe values endorsed by analytical Marxism are familiar from the wider\nsocialist tradition (see entry on\n socialism, \u00a73.1).\n They include: equality; community; democracy; individual freedom; and\nself-realization. Within analytical Marxism, there is no general\nagreement about the character, weight, or potential to conflict, of\nthese. However some examples of their elaboration by analytical\nMarxists can be given.\n\nEquality is understood by Cohen as \u201csocialist equality\nof opportunity\u201d (distinct from bourgeois and left-liberal\nvariants of equality of opportunity). He construes this in a luck\negalitarian way, as seeking to correct for all unchosen disadvantage,\ndisadvantage for which the agent herself cannot be held responsible,\nwhether it reflects social or natural misfortune (2009a: 10\u201311).\nCommunity, on Cohen\u2019s account, requires \u201cthat\npeople care about, and, where necessary and possible, care for, one\nanother, and, too, care that they care about one another\u201d\n(2009a: 34\u201335). Meaningful community is put under strain when\nlarge inequalities obtain, and so this principle limits certain\ninequalities that the egalitarian principle alone would permit.\nDemocracy can be understood as extending beyond the\npolitical, narrowly construed, to require that people have\n\u201cbroadly equal access to the necessary means to participate\nmeaningfully in decisions\u201d affecting their lives as members of\nsociety (Wright 2010: 12). Individual freedom is defended in\na variety of increasingly demanding ways, from negative liberty,\nthough non-domination, to the \u201creal freedom\u201d of having\nsecurity, self-ownership, and the greatest possible opportunity to do\nwhatever you might want to do (Van Parijs 1995: ch. 1). And\nself-realisation is seen as valuable (for reasons involving\nwelfare and autonomy), even if considerations of feasibility and\ndesirability require some scaling down of the classic Marxist\nrequirement of \u201cthe full and free actualization and\nexternalization of the powers and the abilities of the\nindividual\u201d (Elster 1989: 131).\n\nTurning to the kind of institutions that might best embody and promote\nthese, and other, values, it might be said that analytical Marxists\ntypically proceed with a certain humility. In particular, they often\nacknowledge the inhuman and irrational dimensions of many\ntwentieth-century varieties of actually-existing-socialism. Wright\nfiguratively warns that, rather than having detailed maps with clear\ndestinations and identifiable routes, contemporary socialists are in\nthe position of early explorers with a \u201ccompass\u201d and some\nsense of the direction in which they want to go (2006). And Cohen\nwryly cautions that, although we have a reasonably clear sense of\nsocialist values \u201cwe now know that we do not now know\u201d how\nto design the social institutions that might best embody and promote\nthose goods (2009a: 81).\n\nTwo institutional examples of alternatives to capitalism\u2014market\nsocialism and basic income\u2014associated with analytical Marxism\nare sketched here (see also Arneson 1992).\n5.2 \u201cCoupon Socialism\u201d\n\nMarket socialism can take many different forms. John Roemer has developed,\nand serially refined, a particular variant referred to here as\n\u201ccoupon socialism\u201d (1994a, 1994b, 1996). Coupon socialism\nis an example of a kind of market socialism sometimes called\n\u201cshareholder socialism\u201d; that is, a type of economic model\nwhich combines a stock market with public ownership of firms (Corneo\n2017: 184\u2013197). Sceptics might characterise the result as\n\u201ccapitalism without capitalists\u201d, but Roemer defends it as\na feasible and desirable attempt to combine: efficient market\nmechanisms; some state planning over broad investment priorities; an\negalitarian distribution of property rights; and an egalitarian\ndistribution of profits.\n\nRoemer is keen not to rerun earlier battles between socialism and the\nmarket. Socialists, he insists, cannot afford to neglect the\nimportance of efficiency and innovation in generating sustainable\nprosperity. He variously: allows that Soviet-style command economies\nfailed; presents Friedrich Hayek as winning the \u201csocialist\ncalculation debate\u201d; and recommends learning from the real-world\ninstitutional \u201cexperiments\u201d of contemporary capitalisms\n(where ownership and control are already differentiated, and diverse\nmechanisms\u2014involving figurative \u201ccarrots\u201d and\n\u201csticks\u201d\u2014have been developed to tackle\nprincipal-agent problems). A strong public sector is likely to be a\ncentral ingredient of a socialist society, but socialists are\nadmonished to stop \u201cfetishizing\u201d public ownership, and to\nbe open-minded about possible ownership relations, judging them only\nby their effects on equality and efficiency (Roemer 1994b:\n454\u2013457). Roemer\u2019s own earlier work on exploitation had\nconvinced him that property relations and asset inequalities\u2014not\nmarkets as such\u2014are the real problems.\n\nCoupon socialism aims to distribute the profits of firms equally\namongst citizens without unacceptable losses in efficiency compared to\ncontemporary capitalism. The model eliminates capitalist class\nrelations whilst retaining market mechanisms. Ownership is distributed\nequally through arrangements which involve a stock market and\ndecentralised decision making. Its most striking institutional feature\nis perhaps the creation of two kinds of money\u2014call them\n\u201cdollars\u201d and \u201ccoupons\u201d\u2014which are not\nconvertible by individuals (who cannot legally exchange coupons for\ndollars or transfer coupons as gifts or bequests). Dollars are used to\nbuy all the commodities that you might currently purchase (including\nlabour power and consumption goods) except that they cannot be used to\nbuy ownership rights in listed companies. The latter can only be\npurchased by individuals with coupons, and coupons are distributed to\nindividuals in an egalitarian manner. The shares are priced in coupons\nbut any subsequent dividend would be in dollars. At the legal age of\nmaturity, individuals receive their per capita share of the\ntotal coupon value of the economy. It is assumed that most individuals\nwill invest their coupons in shares through mutual funds rather than\ndirectly. A share of a firm entitles the mutual fund to a share of the\nrelevant firm\u2019s profits, and a share of a mutual fund entitles\nthe individual to a share in the fund\u2019s revenues (Roemer 1996:\n20). The model effectively endows citizens at adulthood with a modest\nincome stream during their lives, generated from the profits of public\ncompanies that are not directly owned by the state. The various\nrestrictions on the relevant property rights ensure that the scope for\naccumulating wealth in means of production is limited. Differentials\nin coupon wealth would exist, but the main causes of inequality would\nbe differential wages and savings behaviour.\n\nSuch a brief sketch of coupon socialism raises many questions (see\nWright 1995, and Veneziani 2021, for further discussion). These\ninclude questions about its feasibility and desirability.\n\nFeasibility worries often concern the economic details of the model.\nCritics wonder variously about: the place of small private capitalist\nfirms (shops, restaurants, small manufacturers); the modesty of the\ncoupon-driven income stream; and the structures needed for raising\ninvestment funds (through credit markets and other mechanisms which\nallow companies to convert coupons into dollars subject to regulation)\n(Corneo 2017: 184\u2013197).\n\nDesirability worries often concern the socialist credentials of the\nmodel. Critics wonder variously about: the extent to which these\ninstitutional arrangements might embody and promote an individualism\ncorrosive of community; or how far these arrangements might fail to\nembody and promote the kind of control over work arrangements that\nsocialists have historically endorsed and sought to realise (Wright\n1995).\n\nMore generally, much seems to depends on the intended aim of the\nmodel. Should we think of coupon socialism as: an imaginative\ntheoretical demonstration that economic efficiency can be\nconceptualised outside of capitalist private ownership; a deliberately\nmodest and accessible first step away from capitalist society towards\na more egalitarian future; or as the very best socialist arrangements\nthat are feasible? (These alternatives are not intended to be\nexhaustive.)\n\nRoemer has continued to work on issues of socialist design, focussing\nmore recently on the modelling of individual economic behaviour\n(Roemer 2019a). Any coherent socio-economic system, he suggests,\nrequires \u201cthree pillars\u201d: a set of property relations and\ninstitutions that organise the allocation of resources; a distributive\nethic that identifies a fair or just pattern of income and resources;\nand a behavioural ethos that specifies how economic actors make\ndecisions. These three should work together, in that if economic\nagents act according to the relevant ethos, then the relevant\ninstitutional arrangements should implement the relevant just\ndistribution. Roemer now insists that the behavioural ethos is as\nimportant as the other two pillars, and criticises earlier models of\nmarket socialism\u2014including coupon socialism\u2014for having\nchanged the institutional arrangements of capitalism but kept its\nbehavioural ethos (Roemer 2019a: 179; see Carens 1981 for a possible\nexception).\n\nIn capitalism, the behavioural ethos is said to be\n\u201cindividualism\u201d (the individual \u201cgoes it\nalone\u201d), where each actor is conceived as \u201cbeing in\ncompetition with all other actors, and the actions of all are\nconstrained by nature\u201d. In socialism, in contrast, the\nbehavioural ethos is cooperation, where citizens of a socialist\nsociety are engaged in a cooperative enterprise to transform nature in\norder to improve the lives of everyone (Roemer 2020a:\n10\u201311).\n\nMore precisely, Roemer recommends a socialist model of cooperation\nthat he calls \u201cKantian optimisation\u201d. Kantian optimisation\nchallenges both the standard economic picture of individuals as\nutility maximisers, and in the standard ways in which that standard\npicture is adjusted for other-regarding motivations (Roemer rejects\nthe idea that Nash optimisation is the uniquely rational way to\noptimise). In Kantian optimisation, individuals choose the action that\nmaximises their payoff, assuming that all other agents take the same\naction. Very roughly, cooperation depends, not on altruism (which is\nimplausibly demanding), but on solidarity (the idea that we are\n\u201call in the same boat\u201d) and trust (the idea that if we\ntake the cooperative action, enough others will do so as well). This\nsocialist model of cooperation is said to be realistic, in that it\nrespects certain behavioural results in both the laboratory and real\nlife (recycling and tipping, for instance (Roemer 2019a:\n14\u201316)).\n\nRoemer uses formal models\u2014general competitive equilibrium and\ngame theory\u2014to demonstrate some surprising payoffs for socialist\ndesign once this model of cooperation is integrated into it. Not\nleast, he demonstrates that, under some fairly uncontroversial\nassumptions, market socialist economies can rectify the unequal income\ndistribution of capitalism without paying a price in efficiency or\nmarket failures (Roemer 2019a: 206\u2013207, and Veneziani 2021). In\nshort, given Kantian optimisation, certain familiar problems in\nsocialist design may be less serious than were once thought (Roemer\n2015: 107).\n5.3 Basic Income\n\nThe idea of basic income has a long history (early forerunners include\nThomas Spence 1797 [2004] and Joseph Charlier 1848 [2004]), and some\nconfusingly close relatives (including basic endowment and a negative\nincome tax).  Its most recent revival owes much to Philippe Van\nParijs.  The core idea is deceptively simple and seductive. Basic\nincome consists in: \n\n\na regular income paid in cash to every individual member of a society,\nirrespective of income from other sources and with no strings\nattached. (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 4) \n\n\nThe proposal assumes a territorially defined political community, and\nthat recipients are fiscal residents. The regular payment is in cash\nand not in kind (food, shelter, clothes, etc.). It is paid to each\nindividual, irrespective of their domestic arrangements (not, for\ninstance, only to \u201cheads of households\u201d). It is universal,\ninvolving no means test, but paid, at the same rate, to rich and poor\nalike. And it is an obligation-free payment, carrying no requirement,\nin particular, for beneficiaries to work or be available to work.\n\nBeyond that core idea, particular basic income schemes differ\nconsiderably; not least concerning the level at which the basic income\nis to be paid. To help calibrate alternatives, Van Parijs suggests\nthat an amount corresponding to a quarter of current GDP per\ncapita\u2014which, in 2015, would have corresponded to $1163 per\nmonth in the United States\u2014would sit between\n\u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cgenerous\u201d versions of the\nidea (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 11).\n\nSince the model apparently assumes an economy dominated by\nappropriately regulated capitalist markets, enthusiasm for a basic\nincome might be thought to sit uneasily with the normative commitments\nof analytical Marxism. One response is to emphasise the ways in which\na basic income scheme might reduce our dependence on that market. It could\nvariously: strengthen the bargaining position of workers (against\ntheir employers and others); effect a partial decommodification of\nlabour power (reducing the economic compulsion to sell the latter);\nand make engagement in socially useful but unpaid activities much\neasier (Wright 2005c). So understood, basic income answers questions\nabout both socialist transition and socialist design; a basic income\nscheme might help us move away from a capitalist society, and form part of the\ninstitutional structure of the non-capitalist alternative.\n\nIn a set of delightfully provocative essays written with Robert van\nder Veen, Van Parijs took that suggestion\u2014that a basic income\nscheme might transform capitalism in a progressive direction\u2014and ran\nwith it (Van der Veen & Van Parijs 1986a, 1986b, 2006). They laid out the\npossibility of \u201ca capitalist road to communism\u201d; arguing\nthat welfare state capitalisms have the potential to move smoothly, if\nslowly, towards Marx\u2019s own communist ideal. The communist\n\u201crealm of freedom\u201d\u2014understood here as involving\nwidespread material abundance, voluntary productive contributions\naccording to ability, and distribution according to need\u2014is now\nreached via the introduction of, and gradual increase in, a basic\nincome scheme in capitalist societies. It is not reached by the traditional\n\u201ctransitional\u201d, or \u201cstrictly socialist\u201d, stage\ninvolving state or social ownership of means of production. On this\naccount, that \u201cstrictly socialist\u201d stage is redundant, and\ncan be skipped entirely (for critical comment, see Wright 1994:\n157\u2013172). \n\nFramed in this way, the case for basic income seems to rest on\ncontroversial perfectionist assumptions; for instance, about the\ndisvalue of wage labour and value of unalienated activities (see\nKandiyali 2022). This might make it a hard sell in liberal\npluralistic societies committed to respecting a diversity of\nconceptions of the good life, and Van Parijs has subsequently sought\nto reposition the proposal.\n\nThe appeal of basic income is now said to rest on its emancipatory\npotential, its ability to deliver \u201creal freedom\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cgenuine capacity\u201d of individuals to act on their own life\nplans free from certain debilitating pressures (including unemployment\nand employment traps)\u2014to all. Freedom considerations also, of\ncourse, play a role in determining the form of basic income;\nfor instance, helping to justify its being a cash payment with no\nrestriction on what is purchased or when. The tightness of the\nconnection between basic income and this real libertarian foundation\nmight be doubted, but this is now Van Parijs\u2019 preferred\ngrounding.\n\nSo understood, basic income rests on a conception of social justice\nwhich is both liberal, in not privileging particular contested\nconceptions of the good, and egalitarian, in requiring justifications\nfor any derivation from a baseline equal distribution. Freedom is\ntreated not as a constraint on what justice requires, but as\n\u201cthe very stuff that justice consists in distributing\nfairly\u201d (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 104). Basic income\nis justified as a way of maximising the level of real freedom to those\nwith the least of it (\u201cmaximin real freedom\u201d), or rather\n\u201cmaximining\u201d the \u201cgifts\u201d that form the\n\u201cmaterial substratum\u201d of such real freedom.\n\u201cGifts\u201d here refer to the immense stock of wealth for\nwhich none of us are individually responsible, and which should be\ntreated as our common inheritance (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017:\n104\u2013109).\n\nCriticisms of basic income are sufficiently many and varied to make\nmeaningful summary impractical. However, two familiar worries might be\nnoted.\n\nFirst, a familiar desirability worry is that basic income involves an\napparent unfairness. In advocating unconditional benefits it violates\nsome conception of \u201creciprocity\u201d, allowing individuals to\nreceive a share of their society\u2019s income without making a\nproductive contribution in return (White 2003). Elster provocatively\ndescribes basic income as a recipe for the \u201cexploitation of the\nindustrious by the lazy\u201d (1986b: 719). A number of responses are\navailable, including: conceding the validity of the concern, but seeing\nit as outweighed by the practical difficulties of enacting\nconditionality; or allowing that reciprocity considerations are\npersuasive in the context of certain cooperative ventures, but denying\ntheir relevance in the context of distributive justice.\n\nSecond, a familiar feasibility worry is that basic income schemes\nmight be unaffordable. In facilitating a move away from paid\nproductive activities, basic income risks undermining the very source\nof funding on which it depends. Again, a number of responses are\navailable, including: claiming that perverse labour supply effects\nmight be reduced by taxing things other than individual income\n(natural resources, financial transactions, consumption, and so on);\nor stressing that the weight of this objection depends on the level at\nwhich the basic income is set (uncertainty perhaps recommending that\nwe start low and introduce increases experimentally).\n5.4 Transition\n\nThe lack of agreement about the shape of a desirable and feasible\npost-capitalist future, might make discussion of how to reach that\ngoal look premature. However, preliminary reflection on the issue of\nsocialist transition\u2014of how to get from \u201chere\u201d to\n\u201cthere\u201d\u2014might still be useful. The many examples of\nsuch reflection from within analytical Marxism include: Cohen\u2019s\ndiscussion of the proletariat as a collective agent (2000a:\n101\u2013115); Adam Przeworski\u2019s account of the electoral\ndilemmas of social democracy (1985); and Erik Olin Wright\u2019s\nreflections on socialist strategy. An outline of the latter is\nprovided here.\n\nWright\u2019s ambition\u2014looking both \u201cbehind\u201d and\n\u201cahead\u201d\u2014is to move beyond the tired and limited\ncontrast between \u201creform\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d. He\noffers a conceptual map of socialist\u2014and, more broadly,\nanti-capitalist\u2014strategies that have been historically\nimportant, as well as suggesting how they might be combined in a\nstrategic vision for those seeking to escape the harms of contemporary\ncapitalism (2010: 273\u2013365).\n\nWright (2019: 38\u201353) identifies five \u201cstrategic\nlogics\u201d embodied in anti-capitalist struggles (historical\nexamples of movements adopting them are in parentheses). The initial\npair of examples share a revolutionary goal\u2014replacing capitalism\nwith a very different kind of economic structure\u2014but have\ncompeting accounts of how that might be\naccomplished. First, smashing capitalism: according to which\n\u201ca decisive, ruptural break\u201d with a system that is, at\nroot, unreformable is necessary (see early twentieth-century\nrevolutionary communism). Second,\ndismantling capitalism: according to which democratic\npolitics facilitate state-directed reforms gradually replacing\ncapitalist elements with alternatives (see \u201cdemocratic\nsocialism\u201d). Third, taming capitalism: which typically\nuses state policies of regulation and redistribution in order to\n\u201cneutralise\u201d the harms of capitalism, without trying to\ndestroy their underlying causes (see post-war social democracy). Those\nlast two strategies rely heavily on the exercise of state power, and\nin this respect differ from Wright\u2019s final two models. Fourth,\nresisting capitalism: which involves more or less organised\nattempts within civil society\u2014and not primarily the\nstate\u2014to alleviate the harms of capitalism (see trade unions,\nboycotts, consumer movements, and anarchist-inflected social\nmovements). And fifth, escaping capitalism: which pursues a\nmore separatist strategy, not tackling capitalism directly, but rather\nseeking to isolate a group from its harms (see intentional\ncommunities, communes, and certain religious communities).\n\nWright locates these five \u201cstrategic logics\u201d within a\nschematic typology with two dimensions (2019: 53\u201358). The first\ndimension differentiates between \u201cneutralising harms\u201d and\n\u201ctranscending structures\u201d. The \u201ctaming\u201d and\n\u201cresistance\u201d models aim to neutralise harms; and the\n\u201csmashing\u201d, \u201cdismantling\u201d, and\n\u201cescaping\u201d, models aim to transcend structures. The second\ndimension differentiates between three \u201ctransformative\nlogics\u201d using the metaphor of a \u201cgame\u201d. The\n\u201cruptural\u201d strategy seeks to change the game being played,\nand is exemplified by the \u201csmashing\u201d model. The\n\u201csymbiotic\u201d strategy seeks to change the rules of the game\nbeing played, and is exemplified by the \u201ctaming\u201d and\n\u201cdismantling\u201d models. And the \u201cinterstitial\u201d\nstrategy seeks to change the way in which one plays within a given set\nof rules, and is exemplified by the \u201cresisting\u201d and\n\u201cescaping\u201d models. Anyone seeking to visualise a grid with\nthese two dimensions will realise that one of the six resulting cells\nis empty. No-one presumably uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut, or, a\nlittle less figuratively, no-one thinking that the most effective way\nof neutralising harms is to change the game itself.\n\nWright\u2019s evaluation of these historical movements is broadly\nnegative; they all seem to have either failed at the time, or to have\nonly limited current purchase. From the political vantagepoint of\ndeveloped capitalist countries: revolutionary communism and democratic\nsocialism have largely disappeared; social democracy has declined, and\nlost its connection with labour militancy; and, whilst\n\u201canarchist inflected social movements\u201d survive as perhaps\nthe most dynamic form of anti-capitalism, they often remain\ndisconnected from political projects and parties. Wright appears most\ncritical of the ruptural strategy, doubting that democratic support\nfor a sharp break and rapid transition is sustainable given the nature\nof the \u201ctransition trough\u201d\u2014a concept adopted from\nPrzeworski\u2014faced by the middle classes, in particular (2010:\n308\u2013320). (A \u201ctransition trough\u201d refers to the\ninitial decline in production and living standards that is\nlikely to follow a ruptural break with capitalism. Depending on the\ndepth and extent of these troughs, it might not be in the material\ninterests of individuals to support a ruptural path to socialism even\nwhere they plausibly believe that the material conditions of life\nunder socialism will eventually come to exceed those of\npreviously-existing capitalism.)\n\nLooking forwards, Wright recommends the strategy of eroding\ncapitalism (2019: 59\u201364). Existing economic systems are said to\ncombine capitalism with other economic arrangements, including what we\nmight call proto-socialist alternatives (embodying democracy,\nequality, and community). The eroding strategy combines elements of\ninterstitial and symbiotic approaches. In the former mode, it involves\na \u201cbottom-up\u201d strategy focused on civil society,\nparticipating in various marginal alternative economic activities. In\nthe latter mode, it involves a \u201ctop-down\u201d strategy focused\non the state, seeking to secure and expand those alternatives through\nlaw and public policy. The ambition of this mixed approach is\ngradually to allow proto-socialist economic relations and practices to\nsucceed and displace their capitalist counterparts.\n\nThe strategic vision of eroding capitalism corresponds only\nuncertainly to real world movements, but Wright suggests that certain\nmovements in Latin America and Southern Europe (including Podemos in\nSpain) may capture something of its spirit. He also portrays it as\nanalogous to the process by which capitalism itself historically\ndisplaced feudalism. Proto-capitalist forms of economic life emerged\nin the niches of feudalism, and slowly grew to the point where they\ndisplaced the dominant feudal structures. Political upheavals occurred\nas part of this process, but they typically served to consolidate and\nrationalise socioeconomic changes that had already taken place (Wright\n2019: 61).\n6. Overarching Criticisms\n\nThis entry already contains many examples of criticisms of particular\nauthors and particular arguments within analytical Marxism. However,\nthese were not typically targeted at the intellectual current as a\nwhole. Indeed, some were advanced from perspectives sympathetic to the\napproaches, concerns, and commitments, of analytical Marxism. However,\nthere are also less sympathetic critics willing to move beyond\nspecific authors and arguments, and issue a negative verdict on\nanalytical Marxism as such. These comprehensive criticisms are varied,\nbut might be grouped roughly according to which of the three sources\nand component parts of analytical Marxism forms their central\ntarget.\n\nA first group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the methodological\nclaims of analytical Marxism. The diversity of positive methodological\napproaches amongst analytical Marxists has been emphasised here, but\nthere remains a shared (negative) premise; namely, that there is no\ndistinct and valuable Marxist method. And there are critics\nwho\u2014holding that there is such a method, and that it is superior\nto the \u201cbourgeois\u201d tools adopted by analytical\nMarxism\u2014reject that premise. For example, they might maintain\nthat Marxism is necessarily committed to a \u201cdialectical\u201d\napproach\u2014sometimes based on a wider philosophy of\n\u201cinternal relations\u201d\u2014which analytical Marxists are\nbound to reject (Sayers 1984, 2015). Or, they might suggest that\n\u201canalytical\u201d and \u201cMarxist\u201d are rival\nmethodologies embodying a tension that can only be resolved fully by\none side routing the other; on this account, some September Group\nparticipants are portrayed as remaining true to their analytical\nmethods by slowly abandoning their Marxism (Roberts 1996: 14).\n\nA second group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the substantive\nconcerns of analytical Marxism. The critical suggestion here is\ntypically that in translating the substantive concerns of traditional\nMarxism into the language and frameworks of \u201cmainstream social\nscience\u201d, analytical Marxism has lost what was valuable about\nthem (Levine 2003: 123). For instance, it is suggested that analytical\nMarxism\u2019s treatment of exploitation, class, and history,\ninvolves an abstract, individualistic, and ahistorical, framework that\nmakes its conclusions hard to distinguish, in many respects, from the\ntheories of \u201cbourgeois social science\u201d (E. Wood 1989: 55).\nOr, in an another variant, that analytical Marxists seem to have lost\nsight of, or never really appreciated, the centrality of the\n\u201csystem of labour\u201d to Marx\u2019s substantive account of\nhuman society (Chitty 1998: 40).\n\nA third, and final, group of comprehensive criticisms focus on the\n\u201cnormative turn\u201d of analytical Marxism, reacting against\nthe suggestion that the predictive failures of classical Marxism might\nhave amplified the need for normative clarification and argument (G.\nCohen 2000a: 103\u20134). One variant insists that Marxism neither\nhas, nor needs, a normative theory. Marx is rather to be commended for\nholding that normative theory is pointless because it is\nmotivationally ineffective or unnecessary (Leiter 2002, 2015). Another\nvariant criticises the content, rather than the fact, of analytical\nMarxist commitment to normative theory. For instance, normatively\nspeaking, it suggests that analytical Marxism has increasingly\n\u201cfused and interpenetrated\u201d with left-liberalism, to a\npoint where it is difficult to tell them apart (Bertram 2007:\n137).\n\nThese comprehensive criticisms are not directly challenged here.\nHowever, there are reasons, at least, to hesitate before endorsing\nthem.\n\nFirst, it might simply be too early for comprehensive criticism.\nAttempts at the latter sometimes fail to consider that only a very\nprovisional assessment of analytical Marxism as a research programme\nmight be appropriate at this point. After all, many participants in\nthe first wave of analytical Marxism\u2014including Brenner, Roemer,\nand Van Parijs\u2014continue to produce significant and interesting\nwork. In addition, there are more recent contributions which offer the\npossibility of a constructive future development of the paradigm.\nConsider, for example, the \u201cAfro-analytical Marxism\u201d\noutlined and endorsed by Tommie Shelby (2021). Very roughly, Shelby\napproves of analytical Marxism\u2019s methodological combination of\nanalytical and empirical rigour, together with its substantive\ninterest in exploitation and ideology, but regrets\u2014and seeks to\nmake good\u2014its failure, both to theorise racism and racial\nhierarchy, and to examine the place of the black radical resistance in\nthe fight for social justice and a \u201cpost-capitalist\u201d\nfuture (2021, and Mills 2003: 155). More generally, the future of\nanalytical Marxism looks open; its research programme does not appear\nclosed to future development, nor has it been replaced decisively by a\ncompetitor. The intellectual merits of intellectual\ntraditions\u2014think of utilitarianism, for instance\u2014are not\nalways exhausted by one\u2019s judgement of the first group of\nauthors with whom they are associated. Simply put, it might be better\nto leave the full autopsy until the death of the patient is more\ncertain.\n\nSecond, some of these comprehensive criticisms might appear to be\nunproductively preoccupied with the Marxist credentials of\nanalytical Marxism. \u201cMarxism\u201d is treated stipulatively as\nan honorific, and then this analytical variant is located beyond the\npale\u2014exposed as not Marxist, or not Marxist enough, or not\nMarxist in the right kind of way, or even \u201canti-Marxist\u201d\n(Lebowitz 1988: 195; Hunt 1992: 105).) Of course, this issue\u2014of\nwhether, and to what extent, analytical Marxism is Marxist\u2014can\ntake a legitimate form. It might, for instance, form a step in a more\nsubstantive argument, or the context might be one in which proper\nlabelling is an appropriate concern (intellectual history, for\ninstance). However, in the absence of further argument, these\ncriticisms can appear to adopt an inappropriately\n\u201creligious\u201d approach to the evaluation of an ongoing\nresearch programme. Cohen expresses regret that, historically, it was\nthe label \u201cMarxism\u201d\u2014rather than, say, that of\n\u201cscientific socialism\u201d\u2014that came to be associated\nwith the relevant concerns and commitments. After all, it is typically\nreligions, rather than sciences, which are named after their founders.\nProgressive disciplines are not expected to preserve the\ntheses of their founders (G. Cohen 2000b: xxvii). We do not, for instance, ask\nphysicists whether they are still sufficiently Galilean (assuming, for\nthe sake of the example, that Galileo founded physics)?\n\nThird, and finally, some of these comprehensive criticisms look\nungenerous and one-sided, making little effort to consider the\npotential achievements here. More positively, analytical Marxism might\nbe said to have established itself as an intelligent and valuable form\nof \u201cEnlightenment Marxism\u201d. Its enthusiasm for clarity in,\ncareful elaboration of, and honesty about, arguments, constitute\ncontextually-important reminders of significant intellectual virtues.\nSubstantively, its evolving treatment of core Marxist\nconcerns\u2014including historical development, class, and\nexploitation\u2014reflect and confirm an openness to science, reason,\nand empirical evidence. As such, analytical Marxism recognises and\ncontinues certain valuable, and often neglected, elements of\nMarx\u2019s own thought (Little 1986). In addition, analytical\nMarxism aspires to advance our understanding of the social world\nwithout abandoning, or obscuring, or disparaging, the role of\nnormative theory. Finally, its rejection of Marx\u2019s\n\u201cutopophobia\u201d is well-founded, and its corresponding\nefforts to explore and promote alternatives to capitalism, in ways\nwhich balance the concerns of desirability and feasibility, are\nimaginative and thought-provoking. Analytical Marxism, it might be\nsuggested, rightly takes its place as one current of thought, in a\nwider radical stream, striving to understand social oppression, and to\ncontribute to its reduction and elimination (G. Cohen 2001: 14).",
