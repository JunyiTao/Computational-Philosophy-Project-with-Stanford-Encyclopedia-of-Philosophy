All our information\nabout him is second-hand and most of it vigorously disputed, but his\ntrial and death at the hands of the Athenian democracy is nevertheless\nthe founding myth of the academic discipline of philosophy, and his\ninfluence has been felt far beyond philosophy itself, and in every\nage. Because his life is widely considered paradigmatic not only for\nthe philosophic life but, more generally, for how anyone ought to\nlive, Socrates has been encumbered with the adulation and emulation\nordinarily reserved for religious figures \u2013 strange for someone\nwho tried so hard to make others do their own thinking and for someone\nconvicted and executed on the charge of irreverence toward the gods.\nCertainly he was impressive, so impressive that many others were moved\nto write about him, all of whom found him strange by the conventions\nof fifth-century Athens: in his appearance, personality, and behavior,\nas well as in his views and methods.\n\nSo thorny is the difficulty of distinguishing the historical Socrates\nfrom the Socrateses of the authors of the texts in which he appears\nand, moreover, from the Socrateses of scores of later interpreters,\nthat the whole contested issue is generally referred to as the\nSocratic problem. Each age, each intellectual turn, produces a\nSocrates of its own. It is no less true now that, \u201cThe\n\u2018real\u2019 Socrates we have not: what we have is a set of\ninterpretations each of which represents a \u2018theoretically\npossible\u2019 Socrates,\u201d as Cornelia de Vogel (1955, 28) put\nit. In fact, de Vogel was writing as a new analytic paradigm for\ninterpreting Socrates was about to become standard\u2014Gregory\nVlastos\u2019s model (\u00a72.2), which would hold sway until the mid\n1990s. Who Socrates really was is fundamental to virtually any\ninterpretation of the philosophical dialogues of Plato because\nSocrates is the dominant figure in most of Plato\u2019s\ndialogues.\n", "toc": [{"#SocStr": "1.

Socrates\u2019s strangeness\n\nStandards of beauty are different in different eras, and in\nSocrates\u2019s time beauty could easily be measured by the standard\nof the gods, stately, proportionate sculptures of whom had been\nadorning the Athenian acropolis since about the time Socrates reached\nthe age of thirty. Good looks and proper bearing were important to a\nman\u2019s political prospects, for beauty and goodness were linked\nin the popular imagination. The extant sources agree that Socrates was\nprofoundly ugly, resembling a satyr more than a man\u2014and\nresembling not at all the statues that turned up later in ancient\ntimes and now grace Internet sites and the covers of books. He had\nwide-set, bulging eyes that darted sideways and enabled him, like a\ncrab, to see not only what was straight ahead, but what was beside him\nas well; a flat, upturned nose with flaring nostrils; and large fleshy\nlips like an ass. Socrates let his hair grow long, Spartan-style (even\nwhile Athens and Sparta were at war), and went about barefoot and\nunwashed, carrying a stick and looking arrogant. He didn\u2019t\nchange his clothes but efficiently wore in the daytime what he covered\nhimself with at night. Something was peculiar about his gait as well,\nsometimes described as a swagger so intimidating that enemy soldiers\nkept their distance. He was impervious to the effects of alcohol and\ncold weather, but this made him an object of suspicion to his fellow\nsoldiers on campaign. We can safely assume an average height (since no\none mentions it at all), and a strong build, given the active life he\nappears to have led. Against the iconic tradition of a pot-belly,\nSocrates and his companions are described as going hungry\n(Aristophanes, Birds 1280\u201383). On his appearance, see\nPlato\u2019s Theaetetus 143e, and Symposium\n215a\u2013c, 216c\u2013d, 221d\u2013e; Xenophon\u2019s\nSymposium 4.19, 5.5\u20137; and Aristophanes\u2019s\nClouds 362. Brancusi\u2019s oak sculpture, standing 51.25\ninches including its base, captures Socrates\u2019s appearance and\nstrangeness in the sense that it looks different from every angle,\nincluding a second \u201ceye\u201d that cannot be seen if the first\nis in view. (See the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s\n page on Brancusi\u2019s Socrates\n which offers additional views.) Also true to Socrates\u2019s\nreputation for ugliness, but less available, are the drawings of the\ncontemporary Swiss artist, Hans Erni.\n\nIn the late fifth century B.C.E., it was more or less taken for\ngranted that any self-respecting Athenian male would prefer fame,\nwealth, honors, and political power to a life of labor. Although many\ncitizens lived by their labor in a wide variety of occupations, they\nwere expected to spend much of their leisure time, if they had any,\nbusying themselves with the affairs of the city. Men regularly\nparticipated in the governing Assembly and in the city\u2019s many\ncourts; and those who could afford it prepared themselves for success\nat public life by studying with rhetoricians and sophists from abroad\nwho could themselves become wealthy and famous by teaching the young\nmen of Athens to use words to their advantage. Other forms of higher\neducation were also known in Athens: mathematics, astronomy, geometry,\nmusic, ancient history, and linguistics. One of the things that seemed\nstrange about Socrates is that he neither labored to earn a living,\nnor participated voluntarily in affairs of state. Rather, he embraced\npoverty and, although youths of the city kept company with him and\nimitated him, Socrates adamantly insisted he was not a\nteacher (Plato, Apology 33a\u2013b) and refused all his\nlife to take money for what he did. The strangeness of this behavior\nis mitigated by the image then current of teachers and students:\nteachers were viewed as pitchers pouring their contents into the empty\ncups that were the students. Because Socrates was no transmitter of\ninformation that others were passively to receive, he resists the\ncomparison to teachers. Rather, he helped others recognize on their\nown what is real, true, and good (Plato, Meno,\nTheaetetus)\u2014a new, and thus suspect, approach to\neducation. He was known for confusing, stinging, and stunning his\nconversation partners into the unpleasant experience of realizing\ntheir own ignorance, a state sometimes superseded by genuine\nintellectual curiosity.\n\nIt did not help matters that Socrates seemed to have a higher opinion\nof women than most of his companions had, speaking of \u201cmen and\nwomen,\u201d \u201cpriests and priestesses,\u201d likening his work\nto midwifery, and naming foreign women as his teachers: Socrates\nclaimed to have learned rhetoric from Aspasia of Miletus, the de\nfacto spouse of Pericles (Plato, Menexenus); and to have\nlearned erotics from the priestess Diotima of Mantinea (Plato,\nSymposium). Socrates was unconventional in a related respect.\nAthenian citizen males of the upper social classes did not marry until\nthey were at least thirty, and Athenian females were poorly educated\nand kept sequestered until puberty, when they were given in marriage\nby their fathers. Thus the socialization and education of males often\ninvolved a relationship for which the English word\n\u2018pederasty\u2019 (though often used) is misleading, in which a\nyouth approaching manhood, fifteen to seventeen, became the beloved of\na male lover a few years older, under whose tutelage and through whose\ninfluence and gifts, the younger man would be guided and improved. It\nwas assumed among Athenians that mature men would find youths sexually\nattractive, and such relationships were conventionally viewed as\nbeneficial to both parties by family and friends alike. A degree of\nhypocrisy (or denial), however, was implied by the arrangement:\n\u201cofficially\u201d it did not involve sexual relations between\nthe lovers and, if it did, then the beloved was not supposed to derive\npleasure from the act\u2014but ancient evidence (comedies, vase\npaintings, et al.) shows that both restrictions were often violated\n(Dover 1989, 204). What was odd about Socrates is that, although he\nwas no exception to the rule of finding youths attractive (Plato,\nCharmides 155d, Protagoras 309a\u2013b; Xenophon,\nSymposium 4.27\u201328), he refused the physical advances of\neven his favorite, Alcibiades (Plato, Symposium\n219b\u2013d), and kept his eye on the improvement of their, and all\nthe Athenians\u2019, souls (Plato, Apology 30a\u2013b), a\nmission he said he had been assigned by the oracle of Apollo at\nDelphi, if he was interpreting his friend Chaerephon\u2019s report\ncorrectly (Plato, Apology 20e\u201323b), a preposterous\nclaim in the eyes of his fellow citizens. Socrates also acknowledged a\nrather strange personal phenomenon, a daimonion or internal\nvoice that prohibited his doing certain things, some trivial and some\nimportant, often unrelated to matters of right and wrong (thus not to\nbe confused with the popular notions of a superego or a conscience).\nThe implication that he was guided by something he regarded as divine\nor semi-divine was all the more reason for other Athenians to be\nsuspicious of Socrates.\n\nSocrates was usually to be found in the marketplace and other public\nareas, conversing with a variety of different people\u2014young and\nold, male and female, slave and free, rich and poor, citizen and\nvisitor\u2014that is, with virtually anyone he could persuade to join\nwith him in his question-and-answer mode of probing serious matters.\nSocrates\u2019s lifework consisted in the examination of\npeople\u2019s lives, his own and others\u2019, because \u201cthe\nunexamined life is not worth living for a human being,\u201d as he\nsays at his trial (Plato, Apology 38a). Socrates pursued this\ntask single-mindedly, questioning people about what matters most,\ne.g., courage, love, reverence, moderation, and the state of their\nsouls generally. He did this regardless of whether his respondents\nwanted to be questioned or resisted him. Athenian youths imitated\nSocrates\u2019s questioning style, much to the annoyance of some of\ntheir elders. He had a reputation for irony, though what that means\nexactly is controversial; at a minimum, Socrates\u2019s irony\nconsisted in his saying that he knew nothing of importance and wanted\nto listen to others, yet keeping the upper hand in every discussion.\nOne further aspect of Socrates\u2019s much-touted strangeness should\nbe mentioned: his dogged failure to align himself politically with\noligarchs or democrats; rather, he had friends and enemies among both,\nand he supported and opposed actions of both (see \u00a73).\n2. The Socratic problem: Who was Socrates really?\n\nThe Socratic problem is a rat\u2019s nest of complexities arising\nfrom the fact that various people wrote about Socrates whose\naccounts differ in crucial respects, leaving us to wonder which, if\nany, are accurate representations of the historical Socrates.\n\u201cThere is, and always will be, a \u2018Socratic problem\u2019.\nThis is inevitable,\u201d said Guthrie (1969, 6), looking back on a\ngnarled history between ancient and contemporary times that is\nnarrated in detail by Press (1996), but barely touched on below. The\ndifficulties are increased because all those who knew and wrote about\nSocrates lived before any standardization of modern categories of, or\nsensibilities about, what constitutes historical accuracy or poetic\nlicense. All authors present their own interpretations of the\npersonalities and lives of their characters, whether they mean to or\nnot, whether they write fiction or biography or philosophy (if the\nphilosophy they write has characters), so other criteria must be\nintroduced for deciding among the contending views of who Socrates\nreally was. A look at the three primary ancient sources of information\nabout Socrates (\u00a72.1) will provide a foundation for appreciating\nhow contemporary interpretations differ (\u00a72.2) and why the\ndifferences matter (\u00a72.3).\n\nOne thing is certain about the historical Socrates: even among those\nwho knew him in life, there was profound disagreement about what his\nactual views and methods were. This is evident in the three\ncontemporaneous sources below; and it is hinted at in the few titles\nand scraps by other authors of the time who are now lumped together as\n\u2018minor Socratics\u2019, not for the quality of their work but\nbecause so little or none of it is extant. We shall probably never\nknow much about their views of Socrates (see Giannantoni\n 1990).[2]\n After Socrates\u2019s death, the tradition became even more\ndisparate. As Nehamas (1999, 99) puts it, \u201cwith the exception of\nthe Epicureans, every philosophical school in antiquity, whatever its\norientation, saw in him either its actual founder or the type of\nperson to whom its adherents were to aspire.\u201d\n2.1 Three primary sources: Aristophanes, Xenophon, and Plato\nAristophanes (\u00b1450\u2013\u00b1386)\n\nOur earliest extant source\u2014and the only one who can claim to\nhave known Socrates in vigorous midlife\u2014is the playwright\nAristophanes. His comedy, Clouds, was produced within a year\nof the battle of Delium (423) at which Socrates fought as a hoplite,\nand when both Xenophon and Plato were infants. In the play, the\ncharacter called Socrates heads a Think-o-Rama in which young men\nstudy the natural world, from insects to stars, and study slick\nargumentative techniques as well, lacking all respect for the Athenian\nsense of propriety. The actor wearing the mask of Socrates makes fun\nof the traditional gods of Athens (lines 247\u201348, 367,\n423\u201324), mimicked later by the young protagonist, and gives\nnaturalistic explanations of phenomena Athenians viewed as divinely\ndirected (lines 227\u201333; cf. Theaetetus 152e,\n153c\u2013d, 173e\u2013174a; Phaedo 96a\u2013100a). Worst\nof all, he teaches dishonest techniques for avoiding repayment of debt\n(lines 1214\u20131302) and encourages young men to beat their parents\ninto submission (lines 1408\u201346).\n\nComedy by its very nature is a tricky source for information about\nanyone. Yet, in favor of Aristophanes as a source for Socrates is that\nXenophon and Plato were some forty-five years younger than Socrates,\nso their acquaintance could only have been during Socrates\u2019s\nlater years. Could Socrates really have changed so much? Can the\nlampooning of the younger Socrates found in Clouds and other\ncomic poets be reconciled with Plato\u2019s characterization of a\nphilosopher in his fifties and sixties? Some have said yes, pointing\nout that the years between Clouds and Socrates\u2019s trial\n(399) were years of war and upheaval, changing everyone. The Athenian\nintellectual freedom of which Pericles been so proud at the beginning\nof the war (Thucydides 2.37\u201339) had been eroded completely by\nthe end (see \u00a73). Thus, what had seemed comical a quarter century\nearlier, Socrates hanging in a basket on-stage, talking nonsense, was\nominous in memory by then. A good reason to believe that\nAristophanes\u2019s representation of Socrates is not merely a comic\nexaggeration but systematically misleading in retrospect is Kenneth\nDover\u2019s view that Clouds amalgamates in one character,\nSocrates, features now well known to be unique to specific other\nfifth-century intellectuals (1968, xxxii-lvii). Perhaps Aristophanes\nchose Socrates to represent garden-variety intellectuals because\nSocrates\u2019s physiognomy was strange enough by itself to get a\nlaugh. Aristophanes sometimes speaks in his own voice in his plays,\ngiving us good reason to believe he genuinely objected to social\ninstability brought on by the freedom Athenian youths enjoyed to study\nwith professional rhetoricians, sophists (see \u00a71), and natural\nphilosophers, e.g., those who, like the presocratics, studied the\ncosmos or nature. Such professions could be lucrative. That Socrates\neschewed any earning potential in philosophy does not seem to have\nbeen significant to the great writer of comedies.\n\nAristophanes\u2019s depiction of Socrates is important because\nPlato\u2019s Socrates says at his trial (Apology\n18a\u2013b, 19c) that most of his jurors have grown up believing the\nfalsehoods attributed to him in the play. Socrates calls Aristophanes\nmore dangerous than the three men who brought charges against him\nbecause Aristophanes had poisoned the jurors\u2019 minds while they\nwere young. Aristophanes did not stop accusing Socrates in 423 when\nClouds placed third behind another play in which Socrates was\nmentioned as barefoot; rather, he soon began writing a revision, which\nhe circulated but never produced. Complicating matters, the revision\nis our only extant version of the play. Aristophanes appears to have\ngiven up on reviving Clouds in about 416, but his comic\nridicule of Socrates continued. Again in 414 with Birds, and\nin 405 with Frogs, Aristophanes complained of\nSocrates\u2019s deleterious effect on the youths of the city,\nincluding Socrates\u2019s neglect of the poets. Aristophanes even\ncoins a verb, to socratize, conveying a range of unsavory\n behaviors.[3]\nXenophon (\u00b1425\u2013\u00b1386)\n\nAnother source for the historical Socrates is the soldier-historian,\nXenophon. Xenophon says explicitly of Socrates, \u201cI was never\nacquainted with anyone who took greater care to find out what each of\nhis companions knew\u201d (Memorabilia 4.7.1); and Plato\ncorroborates Xenophon\u2019s statement by illustrating throughout his\ndialogues Socrates\u2019s adjustment of the level and type of his\nquestions to the particular individuals with whom he talked. If it is\ntrue that Socrates succeeded in pitching his conversation at the right\nlevel for each of his companions, the striking differences between\nXenophon\u2019s Socrates and Plato\u2019s is largely explained by\nthe differences between their two personalities. Xenophon was a\npractical man whose ability to recognize philosophical issues is\nalmost imperceptible, so it is plausible that his Socrates is a\npractical and helpful advisor. That is the side of Socrates Xenophon\nexperienced. Xenophon\u2019s Socrates differs additionally from\nPlato\u2019s in offering advice about subjects in which Xenophon was\nhimself experienced, but Socrates was not: moneymaking (Xenophon,\nMemorabilia 2.7) and estate management (Xenophon,\nOeconomicus), suggesting that Xenophon may have entered into\nthe writing of Socratic discourses (as Aristotle labeled the genre,\nPoetics 1447b11) making the character Socrates a mouthpiece\nfor his own views. His other works mentioning or featuring Socrates\nare Anabasis, Apology, Hellenica, and\nSymposium.\n\nSomething that has strengthened Xenophon\u2019s prima facie\nclaim as a source for Socrates\u2019s life is his work as a\nhistorian; his Hellenica (History of Greece) is one\nof the chief sources for the period 411\u2013362, after\nThucydides\u2019s history abruptly ends in the midst of the\nPeloponnesian wars. Although Xenophon tends to moralize and does not\nfollow the superior conventions introduced by Thucydides, still it is\nsometimes argued that, having had no philosophical axes to grind,\nXenophon may have presented a more accurate portrait of Socrates than\nPlato does. But two considerations have always weakened that claim:\n(1) The Socrates of Xenophon\u2019s works is so pedestrian that it is\ndifficult to imagine his inspiring fifteen or more people to write\nSocratic discourses in the period following his death. (2) Xenophon\ncould not have chalked up many hours with Socrates or with reliable\ninformants. He lived in Erchia, about 15 kilometers and across the\nHymettus mountains from Socrates\u2019s haunts in the urban area of\nAthens, and his love of horses and horsemanship (on which he wrote a\nstill-valuable treatise) took up considerable time. He left Athens in\n401 on an expedition to Persia and, for a variety of reasons\n(mercenary service for Thracians and Spartans; exile), never resided\nin Athens again. And now a third is in order. (3) It turns out to have\nbeen ill-advised to assume that Xenophon would apply the same criteria\nfor accuracy to his Socratic discourses as to his\n histories.[4]\n The biographical and historical background Xenophon deploys in his\nmemoirs of Socrates fails to correspond to such additional sources as\nwe have from archaeology, history, the courts, and literature. The\nwidespread use of computers in classical studies, enabling the\ncomparison of ancient persons, and the compiling of information about\neach of them from disparate sources, has made incontrovertible this\nobservation about Xenophon\u2019s Socratic works. Xenophon\u2019s\nmemoirs are pastiches, several of which simply could not have occurred\nas presented.\nPlato (424/3\u2013347)\n\nPhilosophers have usually privileged the account of Socrates given by\ntheir fellow philosopher, Plato. Plato was about twenty-five when\nSocrates was tried and executed, and had probably known the old man\nmost of his life. It would have been hard for a boy of Plato\u2019s\nsocial class, registered in the political district (deme) of Collytus\nwithin the city walls, to avoid Socrates. The extant sources agree\nthat Socrates was often to be found where youths of the city spent\ntheir time. Further, Plato\u2019s representation of individual\nAthenians has proved over time to correspond remarkably well to both\narchaeological and literary evidence: in his use of names and places,\nfamilial relations and friendship bonds, and even in his rough dating\nof events in almost all the authentic dialogues where Socrates is the\ndominant figure. The dialogues have dramatic dates that fall into\nplace as one learns more about their characters and, despite\nincidental anachronisms, it turns out that there is more realism in\nthe dialogues than most have\n suspected.[5]\n The Ion, Lysis, Euthydemus, Meno,\nMenexenus, Theaetetus, Euthyphro,\nCratylus, the frame of Symposium, Apology,\nCrito, Phaedo (although Plato says he was not\nhimself present at Socrates\u2019s execution), and the frame of\nParmenides are the dialogues in which Plato had greatest\naccess to Athenians he depicts.\n\nIt does not follow, however, that Plato represented the views and\nmethods of Socrates (or anyone, for that matter) as he recalled them,\nmuch less as they were originally uttered. There are a number of\ncautions and caveats that should be in place from the start. (i) Plato\nmay have shaped the character Socrates (or other characters) to serve\nhis own purposes, whether philosophical or literary or both. (ii) The\ndialogues representing Socrates as a youth and young man took place,\nif they took place at all, before Plato was born and when he was a\nsmall child. (iii) One should be cautious even about the dramatic\ndates of Plato\u2019s dialogues because they are calculated with\nreference to characters whom we know primarily, though not only, from\nthe dialogues. (iv) Exact dates should be treated with a measure of\nskepticism for numerical precision can be misleading. Even when a\nspecific festival or other reference fixes the season or month of a\ndialogue, or birth of a character, one should imagine a margin of\nerror. Although it becomes obnoxious to use circa or\nplus-minus everywhere, the ancients did not require or desire\ncontemporary precision in these matters. All the children born during\na full year, for example, had the same nominal birthday, accounting\nfor the conversation at Lysis 207b, odd by contemporary\nstandards, in which two boys disagree about who is the elder.\nPhilosophers have often decided to bypass the historical problems\naltogether and to assume for the sake of argument that Plato\u2019s\nSocrates is the Socrates who is relevant to potential\nprogress in philosophy. That strategy, as we shall soon see, gives\nrise to a new Socratic problem (\u00a72.2).\n\nWhat, after all, is our motive for reading a dead philosopher\u2019s\nwords about another dead philosopher who never wrote anything himself?\nThis is a way of asking a popular question, Why do history of\nphilosophy? \u2014which has no settled answer. One might reply that\nour study of some of our philosophical predecessors is\nintrinsically valuable, philosophically enlightening and\nsatisfying. When we contemplate the words of a dead philosopher, a\nphilosopher with whom we cannot engage directly\u2014Plato\u2019s\nwords, say\u2014we seek to understand not merely what he said and\nassumed, but what his statements imply, and whether they are true.\nOthers\u2019 words can prompt the exploration of new and rich veins\nof philosophy. Sometimes, making such judgments about the text\nrequires us to learn the language in which the philosopher wrote, more\nabout his predecessors\u2019 ideas and those of his contemporaries.\nThe truly great philosophers, and Plato was one of them, are still\ncapable of becoming our companions in philosophical conversation, our\ndialectical partners. Because he addressed timeless, universal,\nfundamental questions with insight and intelligence, our own\nunderstanding of such questions is heightened whether we agree or\ndisagree. That explains Plato, one might say, but where is Socrates in\nthis picture? Is he interesting merely as a predecessor to Plato? Some\nwould say yes, but others would say it is not Plato\u2019s but\nSocrates\u2019s ideas and methods that mark the real beginning of\nphilosophy in the West, that Socrates is the better dialectical guide,\nand that what is Socratic in the dialogues should be distinguished\nfrom what is Platonic (\u00a72.2). But how? That again is the\nSocratic problem.\n2.2 Contemporary interpretative strategies\n\nIf it were possible to confine oneself exclusively to Plato\u2019s\nSocrates, the Socratic problem would nevertheless reappear\nbecause one would soon discover Socrates himself defending one\nposition in one Platonic dialogue, its contrary in another, and using\ndifferent methods in different dialogues to boot. Inconsistencies\namong the dialogues seem to demand explanation, though not all\nphilosophers have thought so (Shorey 1903). Most famously, the\nParmenides attacks various theories of forms that the\nRepublic, Symposium, and Phaedo develop and\ndefend. In some dialogues (e.g., Laches), Socrates only weeds\nthe garden of its inconsistencies and false beliefs, but in other\ndialogues (e.g., Phaedrus), he is a planter as well,\nadvancing structured philosophical claims and suggesting new methods\nfor testing those claims. There are differences on smaller matters as\nwell. For example, Socrates in the Gorgias opposes, while in\nthe Protagoras he supports, hedonism; the details of the\nrelation between erotic love and the good life differ from\nPhaedrus to Symposium; the account of the relation\nbetween knowledge and the objects of knowledge in Republic\ndiffers from the Meno account; despite Socrates\u2019s\ncommitment to Athenian law, expressed in the Crito, he vows\nin the Apology that he will disobey the lawful jury if it\norders him to stop philosophizing. A related problem is that some of\nthe dialogues appear to develop positions familiar from other\nphilosophical traditions (e.g., that of Heraclitus in\nTheaetetus and Pythagoreanism in Phaedo). Three\ncenturies of efforts to solve versions of the Socratic problem are\nsummarized in the following supplementary document:\n\nEarly Attempts to Solve the Socratic Problem\n\n\nContemporary efforts recycle bits and pieces\u2014including the\nfailures\u2014of these older attempts.\nThe Twentieth Century\n\nUntil relatively recently in modern times, it was hoped that confident\nelimination of what could be ascribed purely to Socrates would leave\nstanding a coherent set of doctrines attributable to Plato (who\nappears nowhere in the dialogues as a speaker). Many philosophers,\ninspired by the nineteenth century scholar Eduard Zeller, expect the\ngreatest philosophers to promote grand, impenetrable schemes. Nothing\nof the sort was possible for Socrates, so it remained for\nPlato to be assigned all the positive doctrines that could be\nextracted from the dialogues. In the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, however, there was a resurgence of interest in who\nSocrates was and what his own views and methods were. The\nresult is a narrower, but no less contentious, Socratic problem. Two\nstrands of interpretation dominated views of Socrates in the twentieth\ncentury (Griswold 2001; Klagge and Smith 1992). Although there has\nbeen some healthy cross-pollination and growth since the mid 1990s,\nthe two were so hostile to one another for so long that the bulk of\nthe secondary literature on Socrates, including translations peculiar\nto each, still divides into two camps, hardly reading one another:\nliterary contextualists and analysts. The literary-contextual study of\nSocrates, like hermeneutics more generally, uses the tools of literary\ncriticism\u2014typically interpreting one complete dialogue at a\ntime; its European origins are traced to Heidegger and earlier to\nNietzsche and Kierkegaard. The analytic study of Socrates, like\nanalytic philosophy more generally, is fueled by the arguments in the\ntexts\u2014typically addressing a single argument or set of\narguments, whether in a single text or across texts; its origins are\nin the Anglo-American philosophical tradition. Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1900\u20132002) was the doyen of the hermeneutic strand, and Gregory\nVlastos (1907\u20131991) of the analytic.\nLiterary contextualism\n\nFaced with inconsistencies in Socrates\u2019s views and methods from\none dialogue to another, the literary contextualist has no Socratic\nproblem because Plato is seen as an artist of surpassing literary\nskill, the ambiguities in whose dialogues are intentional\nrepresentations of actual ambiguities in the subjects philosophy\ninvestigates. Thus terms, arguments, characters, and in fact all\nelements in the dialogues should be addressed in their literary\ncontext. Bringing the tools of literary criticism to the study of the\ndialogues, and sanctioned in that practice by Plato\u2019s own use of\nliterary devices and practice of textual critique (Protagoras\n339a\u2013347a, Republic 2.376c\u20133.412b, Ion,\nand Phaedrus 262c\u2013264e), most contextualists ask of\neach dialogue what its aesthetic unity implies, pointing out\nthat the dialogues themselves are autonomous, containing almost no\ncross-references. Contextualists who attend to what they see as the\naesthetic unity of the whole Platonic corpus, and therefore seek a\nconsistent picture of Socrates, advise close readings of the dialogues\nand appeal to a number of literary conventions and devices said to\nreveal Socrates\u2019s actual personality. For both varieties of\ncontextualism, the Platonic dialogues are like a brilliant\nconstellation whose separate stars naturally require separate\nfocus.\n\nMarking the maturity of the literary contextualist tradition in the\nearly twenty-first century is a greater diversity of approaches and an\nattempt to be more internally critical (see Hyland 2004).\nAnalytic developmentalism\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Vlastos (1991, 45\u201380) recommended a set\nof mutually supportive premises that together provide a plausible\nframework in the analytic tradition for Socratic philosophy as a\npursuit distinct from Platonic \n philosophy.[6]\n Although the premises have\ndeep roots in early attempts to solve the Socratic problem (see the\nsupplementary document linked above), the beauty of Vlastos\u2019s\nparticular configuration is its fecundity. The first premise marks a\nbreak with a tradition of regarding Plato as a dialectician who held\nhis assumptions tentatively and revised them constantly; rather,\n\nPlato held philosophical doctrines, and\nPlato\u2019s doctrines developed over the period in\nwhich he wrote,\n\n\naccounting for many of the inconsistencies and contradictions among\nthe dialogues (persistent inconsistencies are addressed with a complex\nnotion of Socratic irony.) In particular, Vlastos tells a story\n\u201cas hypothesis, not dogma or reported fact\u201d describing the\nyoung Plato in vivid terms, writing his early dialogues while\nconvinced of \u201cthe substantial truth of Socrates\u2019s teaching\nand the soundness of its method.\u201d Later, Plato develops into a\nconstructive philosopher in his own right but feels no need to break\nthe bond with his Socrates, his \u201cfather image.\u201d (The\nremainder of Plato\u2019s story is not relevant to Socrates.) Vlastos\nlabels a small group of dialogues \u2018transitional\u2019 to mark\nthe period when Plato was beginning to be dissatisfied with\nSocrates\u2019s views. Vlastos\u2019s third premise is\n\nIt is possible to determine reliably the chronological order in\nwhich the dialogues were written and to map them to the development of\nPlato\u2019s views.\n\n\nThe evidence Vlastos uses varies for this claim, but is of several\ntypes: stylometric data, internal cross references, external events\nmentioned, differences in doctrines and methods featured, and other\nancient testimony (particularly that of Aristotle). The dialogues of\nPlato\u2019s Socratic period, called \u201celenctic dialogues\u201d\nfor Socrates\u2019s preferred method of questioning, are Apology,\nCharmides, Crito, Euthyphro, Gorgias, Hippias Minor, Ion, Laches,\nProtagoras, and book 1 of the Republic. The\ndevelopmentalists\u2019 Platonic dialogues are potentially a discrete\nsequence, the order of which enables the analyst to separate Socrates\nfrom Plato on the basis of different periods in Plato\u2019s\nintellectual evolution. Finally,\n\nPlato puts into the mouth of Socrates only what Plato himself\nbelieves at the time he writes each dialogue.\n\n\n\u201cAs Plato changes, the philosophical persona of his Socrates is\nmade to change\u201d (Vlastos 1991, 53)\u2014a view sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201cmouthpiece theory.\u201d Because the\nanalyst is interested in positions or doctrines (particularly as\nconclusions from, or tested by, arguments), the focus of analysis is\nusually on a particular philosophical view in or across dialogues,\nwith no special attention given to context or to dialogues considered\nas wholes; and evidence from dialogues in close chronological\nproximity is likely to be considered more strongly confirming than\nthat from dialogues of other developmental periods. The result of\napplying the premises is a firm list (contested, of course, by others)\nof ten theses held by Socrates, all of which are incompatible with the\ncorresponding ten theses held by Plato (1991, 47\u201349).\n\nMany analytic ancient philosophers in the late twentieth century mined\nthe gold Vlastos had uncovered, and many of those who were productive\nin the developmentalist vein in the early days went on to constructive\nwork of their own (see Bibliography).\n2.3 Implications for the philosophy of Socrates\n\nIt is a risky business to say where ancient philosophy is now, but an\nadvantage of an entry in a dynamic reference work is that authors are\nallowed, nay, encouraged to update their entries to reflect\nrecent scholarship and sea changes in their topics. For many analytic\nphilosophers, John Cooper (1997, xiv) sounded the end of the\ndevelopmentalist era when he described the early- and middle-period\ndialogue distinctions as \u201can unsuitable basis for bringing\nanyone to the reading of these works. To use them in that way is to\nannounce in advance the results of a certain interpretation of the\ndialogues and to canonize that interpretation under the guise of a\npresumably objective order of composition\u2014when in fact no such\norder is objectively known. And it thereby risks prejudicing\nan unwary reader against the fresh, individual reading that these\nworks demand.\u201d When he added, \u201cit is better to relegate\nthoughts about chronology to the secondary position they deserve and\nto concentrate on the literary and philosophical content of the works,\ntaken on their own and in relation to the others,\u201d he proposed\npeace between the literary contextualist and analytic developmentalist\ncamps. As in any peace agreement, it takes some time for all the\ncombatants to accept that the conflict has ended\u2014but that is\nwhere we are.\n\nIn short, one is now more free to answer, Who was Socrates really? in\nthe variety of ways that it has been answered in the past, in\none\u2019s own well-reasoned way, or to sidestep the question,\nphilosophizing about the issues in Plato\u2019s dialogues without\nworrying too much about the long toes of any particular interpretive\ntradition. Those seeking the views and methods of Plato\u2019s\nSocrates from the perspective of what one is likely to see attributed\nto him in the secondary literature (\u00a72.2) will find it useful to\nconsult the related entry on\n Plato\u2019s shorter ethical works.\n3. A Chronology of the historical Socrates in the context of Athenian history and the dramatic dates of Plato\u2019s dialogues\n\nThe larger column on the left below provides some of the biographical\ninformation from ancient sources with the dramatic dates of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues interspersed [in boldface]\nthroughout. In the smaller column on the right are dates of major\nevents and persons familiar from fifth century Athenian history.\nAlthough the dates are as precise as allowed by the facts, some are\nestimated and controversial (Nails 2002).\n\n\n\nWhen Socrates was born in 469, a Persian invasion\nhad been decisively repulsed at Plataea, and the Delian League that\nwould grow into the Athenian empire had already been formed. Attica\ncomprised 139 political districts (demes), assigned variously to\nAthens\u2019s ten tribes; regardless of how far from the walled urban\ncenter a deme might be, its registered members were Athenian.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019s tribe was Antiochis, and his deme was Alopece\n(south-southeast of the city wall). Assuming that his stoneworker\nfather, Sophroniscus, kept to the conventions, he carried the infant\naround the hearth, thereby formally admitting him into the family,\nfive days after he was born, named him on the tenth day, presented him\nto his phratry (a regional hereditary association) and took\nresponsibility for socializing him into the various institutions\nproper to an Athenian male. Literacy had become widespread among males\nsince about 520, and there were a number of elementary schools\nteaching boys to read and write, along with the traditional gymnastics\nand music, by the 480s (Harris 1989, 55), so we can be confident that\nSocrates received a formal education and that Plato was not\nexaggerating when he described the young Socrates as eagerly acquiring\nthe philosopher Anaxagoras\u2019s books (scrolls, to be more precise,\nPhaedo 98b). \n \n469 tragedies of Aeschylus, poetry\nof Pindar prominent\n\n462 democratic judicial reform of the Areopagus\n\n459 Athens\u2019s long walls to the Piraeus port\nbegun\n\n450s Athens extends empire, introduces democratic\nreforms (archonship opened to third citizen class, pay for jurors\ninstituted, citizenship restricted) \n\nIn Socrates\u2019s eighteenth year, Sophroniscus presented him\nto the deme in a ceremony called dokimasia. He was there\nexamined and entered onto the citizens\u2019 roll, making him\neligible\u2014subject to age or class restrictions\u2014for the many\ntasks of government determined by lot or required of all citizens,\nbeginning with two years of compulsory training in the Athenian\nmilitia. In an important sense, the dokimasia marked a young\nman\u2019s allegiance to the laws of Athens. Sophroniscus died soon\nafter Socrates came of age, making him his mother\u2019s legal\nguardian. Socrates\u2019s mother, Phaenarete, later remarried and had\na second son, Patrocles (Plato, Euthydemus 297e); she became\na midwife sometime thereafter (Plato, Theaetetus149a).\n\n\nAthens was a city of numerous festivals, competitions, and\ncelebrations, including the Panathenaea that attracted visitors to the\ncity from throughout the Mediterranean. Like the Olympics, the\nPanathenaea was celebrated with special splendor at four-year\nintervals. [450 Parmenides] Plato depicts\nthe nineteen-year-old Socrates in conversation with the great visiting\nphilosophers from Elea, Parmenides and Zeno, at one of the Greater\nPanathenaea festivals, in late July or early August of 450. \n \n450\u2013430 \u201cGolden Age of\nPericles\u201d: construction on the Athenian acropolis, led by\nPhidias, Polyclitus; tragedy dominated by Sophocles and Euripides;\nnatural philosophy, rhetoric, and sophistry thrive in atmosphere of\nrelative affluence and freedom \n\nAfter completing his two years of military training, Socrates\nwas subject to being sent beyond the borders of Attica with the army,\nbut these were years of relative peace, so he is likely to have\npracticed a trade, at least until he gave his mother in marriage to\nChaeredemus. Only at the age of thirty was eligibility reached for\nsuch responsibilities and offices as jury service, generalship, and\nCouncil (executive body for the sovereign Assembly), so Athenian men\nlived at home with their parents during those ten years,\nand\u2014depending on their class in Athens\u2019s rigid four-class\nsystem, based on wealth and birth\u2014they spent that period\nlearning a trade or acquiring the skills in public speaking and\npersuasion that would serve them well in Athens\u2019s citizen\nAssembly and courts. [433/2 Protagoras] When\nPlato next writes of Socrates, he is attending Callias\u2019s\n\u201copen house\u201d where famous educators of the day\n(Protagoras, Prodicus, Hippias) are vying for the lucrative\nopportunity to teach the wealthiest and most prominent young men of\nthe city.\n \n448 Spartan invasion\n\n446 defeat at Coronea, loss of Boeotia, Spartan\ninvasion\n\n446/5 Thirty Years\u2019 Peace signed with Sparta\n\n442 comedy added to the Lenaean festival\n\n433 Protagoras in Athens \n\nAthens was even then, however, sliding toward war with Sparta on\na scale that would involve all of Greece over the next three decades.\nTwo of Plato\u2019s longer dialogues are set loosely throughout the\nwar. [431\u2013404 Republic, Gorgias] Both\nSocrates and Alcibiades were posted that summer, 432, to Potidaea to\nput down a revolt, Socrates as a footsoldier (hoplite). After\nan initial battle, a long siege reduced the population to cannibalism\nbefore it surrendered (Thucydides 2.70.1). As the army made its way\nhome, it engaged in battle near Spartolus and suffered heavy losses\n(Thucydides 2.79.1\u20137). Socrates distinguished himself there by\nsaving the life and armor of the wounded Alcibiades (Plato,\nSymposium 220d\u2013e). When the army finally returned to\nAthens in May of 429, nearly three years had elapsed since its\ndeployment. Soon after his return, Socrates was accused by a comic\nplaywright of helping Euripides to write his tragedies, a claim that\nwas to be repeated at least twice more, by other comedy writers, on\nthe Athenian stage. Plato illustrates Socrates\u2019s arrival and\nreturn to conversation in the Charmides [429\nCharmides], where\nparticipants (including Plato\u2019s relatives Critias and Charmides)\ndiscuss moderation.\n \n432 revolt at Potidaea\n\n431 Peloponnesian War begins\n\n430 outbreak of plague\n\n429 death of Pericles\n\n427 Gorgias in Athens\n\n425 Spartan peace offer refused \n\nSocrates\u2019s active duty continued at the battle of Delium\nin 424, under the command of Laches. This was another defeat for the\nAthenian army which, while already under attack from Boeotian\nfootsoldiers, was surprised by a troop of cavalry. Socrates\u2019s\nheroic behavior in the retreat is praised by Laches (Laches\n181b) the following winter, and later by Alcibiades (Plato,\nSymposium 221a). [424 Laches] The\nLaches, on the nature of courage, shows Socrates as a friend\nof the famous Athenian general Nicias and makes a point of\nSocrates\u2019s being a favorite of the city\u2019s youths while\nremaining unknown to most of his fellow citizens. Any anonymity\nSocrates may have enjoyed came to an abrupt end at the annual\nDionysian festival in the spring of 423. In the comedy category, at\nleast two of the plays involved Socrates: one had the title of\nSocrates\u2019s music teacher, Connus; the other was\nAristophanes\u2019s Clouds (\u00a72.1).\n \n424 battle of Delium\n\n424/3 birth of Plato\n\n423 one-year truce with Sparta; Aristophanes,\nClouds \n\nA year later, Socrates fought at Amphipolis, another Athenian\ndisaster following another surprise attack. Socrates, so far as we\nknow, did not return to war again. Athens and Sparta entered into a\ntreaty named for Nicias that\u2014while never completely\neffective\u2014allowed Attica to remain free of Spartan invasion and\ncrop-burnings for several years. During the peace, Socrates is\nrepresented as carrying on with his dialectical conversations with\nAthenians, concentrating on the nature of erotic love\n[418\u2013416 Phaedrus], especially in\nrelation to the education in rhetoric that had been especially popular\nin Athens since Gorgias\u2019s visit in 427. Plato\u2019s\nSymposium also focuses on erotic love, bringing together in\nFebruary of 416 renowned Athenians\u2014Socrates, the tragedian\nAgathon, the comedian Aristophanes, the general Alcibiades, a doctor,\nan orator, an unknown follower of Socrates, and Agathon\u2019s older\nlover\u2014who give speeches in praise of love [416\nSymposium]. Again education is a central theme, but\nso are the democracy and Eleusinian Mystery religion. In fact, at\nleast half the persons who celebrated Agathon\u2019s victory in the\ntragedy competition were implicated in acts of\nsacrilege\u2014profanations of the Eleusinian\nMysteries\u2014presaged in the dialogue, that were said to have taken\nplace in the months following the symposium but that had not been\nreported to the authorities until much later.\n \n422 battle of Amphipolis\n\n421 \u201cPeace of Nicias\u201d declared\n\n416 subjugation of Melos \n\nIt was at about this time that Socrates married Xanthippe. From\nthe fact that they named their first son Lamprocles, it has been\nassumed both that her father was named Lamprocles and that her dowry\nwas enough to provide for her needs. Their second son would be named\nSophroniscus for Socrates\u2019s father.\n \n  \n\nMeanwhile, Alcibiades persuaded the Assembly, over prescient\nobjections from Nicias (Thucydides 6.9\u201314), that Athens should\ninvade Sicily. Both Nicias and Alcibiades, along with Lamachus, were\nelected to command. When the ships had been supplied and were on the\nverge of sailing, almost all the city\u2019s boundary markers, called\nherms, statues of the face and phallus of the god Hermes,\nwere mutilated in a single night. Since Hermes was the god of travel,\nthe city feared a conspiracy against the democracy. A commission was\nformed to investigate not only the herm-smashing, but all crimes of\nirreverence (asebeia) that could be discovered, offering\nrewards for information. In a climate of near-hysteria over three\nmonths, accusations led to executions (including summary executions),\nexile, torture, and imprisonment affecting hundreds of people, some of\nwhom were close to Socrates (Alcibiades, Charmides, Critias,\nEryximachus, Phaedrus, and others). The actual herm-mutilators turned\nout to be a young men\u2019s drinking club, and some of the accusers\nultimately admitted to lying; although death penalties that has been\nimposed in absentia were rescinded, nothing could bring back\nthe innocent dead.\n \n415 preparations to invade Sicily;\nherm mutilations; fleet embarks; commission receives evidence\n\n414 Alcibiades recalled for trial, defects to Sparta;\nsiege of Syracuse; death of Lamachus\n\n414 (winter) Sparta reenters the war, following\nAlcibiades\u2019s advice, takes and fortifies the deme of Decelea,\nencouraging Athenian slaves to escape \n\nAs the Sicilian invasion foundered, Nicias, in sole command\nwhile gravely ill with kidney disease, sent a letter to the Athenians\nsaying the army was under siege and should be called back or\nreinforced; he asked to be relieved of his command (Thucydides\n7.11\u201315). He was not relieved, but reinforcements were\nsent\u2014too few, too late. The war in Sicily ended in complete and\nhumiliating defeat. Spring brought a new attack on Socrates by\nAristophanes (Birds, lines 1280\u20133, 1553\u20135). Plato\nsets a dialogue between Socrates and a rhapsode before the news of the\ndefeat reached Athens [413 Ion], while the\ncity\u2014short of military leaders\u2014was trying to attract\nforeign generals to help with the war.\n \n413 reinforcements arrive in\nSicily; army annihilated, some enslaved; execution of Nicias\n\n\nThe next few years were chaotic in Athens as the empire shrank\nfrom revolts, and former allies refused to pay extortion/tribute any\nlonger. The treasury was spent, and the citizenry demoralized. The\ndemocracy was overthrown in a revolution of \u201cthe Four\nHundred\u201d followed by a government of \u201cthe Five\nThousand.\u201d What was left of the army, however, was loyal to the\ndemocracy and persuaded Alcibiades to return to his former command.\nUnder his leadership, Athens began scoring victories, and morale\nimproved. Democracy was restored, peace offers from Sparta were again\nrebuffed, and Athens established a commission to rewrite all the\nexisting laws.\n \n412 subject-allies revolt against\nAthens\n\n411 oligarchic revolution; Alcibiades returns to\ncommand\n\n410 restoration of democracy; peace with Sparta\nrefused; legal reforms begun \n\nA wrestling school, newly erected, is the setting for Socrates\nto examine the nature of friendship with a group of adolescents\n[409 Lysis] who were agemates of Plato and\nhis older brothers. One of the Lysis characters, Ctesippus,\nwas present again two years later for a display by two sophists\n(former generals) [407 Euthydemus].\n \n407 Alcibiades in Athens; battle\nof Notium lost, Alcibiades dismissed \n\nAthens was meanwhile pursuing the war with Sparta by sea. Athens\nwon the sea battle of Arginusae, but at such cost that the city never\nrecovered: in barest outline, what happened was this. Two of\nAthens\u2019s board of ten generals were under siege at Mytilene, so\nthe other eight commanded the battle. With thousands dead, and damage\nto the fleet, two captains were sent to collect the casualties; a\nstorm prevented their doing so, while the generals hastened to give\nrelief at Mytilene. When news of the battle hit Athens, there was\noutrage at the failure to save the wounded and collect the corpses for\nburial. The board of ten generals was charged, but two fled (and two\nwere still in Mytilene), so six returned to Athens for trial in\nOctober of 406 (Lang 1990). By luck of the lottery, Socrates was\nserving on the Prytanes, the presiding committee of Council (Plato,\nApology 32b; Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.15) when the\ntrial took place, not in a court before a jury but before the whole\nAssembly.\n \n406 battle of Arginusae; trial and\nexecution of the generals; deaths of Euripides and Sophocles\n\n\nThe generals were being tried for a capital crime in one\nday\u2014a flaw in the Athenian legal code that Socrates would later\ncriticize (Plato, Apology 37a\u2013b)\u2014but, even worse,\nthey were being tried as a group, in direct violation of the Athenian\nlaw of Cannonus requiring each defendant in a capital crime to receive\na separate trial. Some in the Assembly opposed the illegality, but the\nopposition so incensed the majority that it overwhelmingly approved a\nmotion to subject the opposition to the same vote as would decide the\nfate of the generals. At that point, several of the fifty members of\nthe Prytanes refused to put the question, so the generals\u2019\naccusers roused the crowd to greater anger. Socrates alone among the\nPrytanes was left standing for the law and the generals; his refusal\nto allow the vote had the effect of allowing one last, eloquent speech\nfrom the floor that proposed a preliminary vote to decide between\nsentencing the group and permitting separate trials (Xenophon,\nHellenica 1.7.16\u201333). The Assembly approved separate\ntrials, but a parliamentary maneuver invalidated the vote. When the\nAssembly voted again, it was to decide the lives of the generals up or\ndown. All were condemned. The Athenians were soon to regret having\nexecuted their remaining military leaders.\n \n  \n\nThe following spring, Aristophanes again attacked Socrates, this\ntime declaring that it was no longer fashionable to associate with\nSocrates who, with his \u201chairsplitting twaddle,\u201d ignored\nthe craft of the tragedians (Frogs, lines\n1491\u201399).\n \n405 battle of Aegospotami; siege\nof Athens \n\nThe next naval battle, Aegospotami, was cataclysmic and was\nfollowed by the Spartan siege of Athens. The Athenians, recalling\ntheir own treatment of the Melians, expected to be slaughtered when\nthe siege inevitably ended, but nothing of the sort occurred. When the\nSpartans entered Athens, they required that the defensive long walls\nbe demolished, and they directed that the Athenians elect a government\nthat would reinstitute the city\u2019s ancestral constitution to\nprevent the excesses of the democratic Assembly. The\nauthority of the government that was subsequently elected,\nperhaps three per tribe\u2014\u201cthe Thirty\u201d\u2014lies at\nthe root of any discussion of whether Socrates committed what would\nnow be called civil disobedience when he disobeyed their order (Plato,\nApology 32c\u2013e). None of the contemporaneous sources, no\nmatter how hostile to the rule of the Thirty\u2014Isocrates, Lysias,\nPlato, and Xenophon\u2014denies the legitimacy of their election.\nThat they formed a government that abused and exceeded its authority\nno one could reasonably deny, but it is against just such governments\nthat acts of civil disobedience must sometimes be directed.\nUndermining a corrupt government by refusing to harm a good man might\nbe unlawful, but not unjust.\n \n404 legal reforms begun in 410\ncompleted; board appointed to add new laws, assisted by Council; death\nof Alcibiades; Spartans enter the city under Lysander; long walls\ndemolished; \u201cthe Thirty\u201d elected; seizures and executions;\nroll of \u201cthe Three Thousand\u201d; death of Theramenes;\ndemocratic exodus to Phyle \n\nThe Thirty moved quickly after the election to consolidate power\nby calling for Spartan aid, seizing the property of wealthy Athenians\nand foreign residents, many of whom they executed (including\nLysias\u2019s brother, Polemarchus; and Nicias\u2019s son,\nNiceratus\u2014associates of Socrates). Critias and Charicles, two\nleaders of the Thirty, sought to intimidate Socrates by forbidding\nhim, unsuccessfully, to speak to men under thirty (Xenophon,\nMemorabilia 1.2.35). As the scope of the government\u2019s\nexecutions widened to include detractors, and a select citizen roll of\n3,000 was named, and all others disarmed, a moderate member of the\nThirty, Theramenes, objected to the wanton killings and found himself\ntaken captive at Critias\u2019s instigation. Socrates, and two young\nmen with him, were said to have attempted to intervene unarmed against\nthe Scythian guards, stopped only when Theramenes himself implored\nthem to desist (Diodorus Siculus 14.5.1\u20133, likely apocryphal).\nAfter Theramenes\u2019s execution, many citizens left the walled\ncity: some regrouped in the distant and mountainous deme of Phyle,\nplanning to topple the Thirty (among them was Socrates\u2019s\nchildhood friend, Chaerephon); others went only as far as the Piraeus\nwhere \u201cthe Ten\u201d (including Charmides) chosen by the Thirty\nwere less effective at suppression than the Thirty themselves.\n \n  \n\nThe Thirty, now increasingly viewed as tyrannical, were also\nmaking contingency plans: they sent forces to secure the deme of\nEleusis for themselves by putting to death the population on charges\nof supporting democracy (Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.8\u201310;\nDiodorus Siculus 14.32.5). Socrates remained in the city. The Thirty\nattempted to implicate him in their executions by ordering him to join\nothers in going to Salamis to fetch the former democratic general,\nLeon. It was Socrates\u2019s refusal to obey this order that has\ncontroversially been called an act of civil disobedience. Luckily for\nSocrates, before the Thirty could exact revenge, the democrats from\nPhyle entered the city through the Piraeus and met the forces of the\nThirty in a battle where both Critias and Charmides were killed.\nRemnants of the Thirty returned to the city to consider their options.\nThe Three Thousand, increasingly suspicious of one another, deposed\nthe Thirty and replaced them with a Board of Ten that was elected one\nper tribe (Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.23). The Thirty began\nabandoning the city for Eleusis as the board called for Spartan help.\nThe Spartans arrived, led by Lysander and by one of their two kings,\nPausanias. Pausanias especially attempted to effect reconciliation\namong all the Athenian factions, allowing the exiles to return and the\noligarchs to rule themselves in Eleusis. One such exile was Anytus, a\nman hostile to Socrates and who would later support charges of\nirreverence against him. [402 Meno]. As soon\nas the Spartans\u2019 backs were turned, the restored democrats\nraided Eleusis and killed the remaining oligarchic supporters,\nsuspecting them of hiring mercenaries. [winter 401/0\nMenexenus]\n \n403 battle of Munychia; Board of\nTen takes charge, calls for Spartan aid; Spartans arrive;\nreconciliation talks begin; exiles return\n\n403/2 new legal era proclaimed; new religious\ncalendar adopted; Sparta encourages reconciliation among Athenian\nfactions\n\n402\u2013400 Spartan war with Elis\n\n401 remaining oligarchs killed; Xenophon leaves\nAthens\n\n400 conflict shifts to the courts  \n\n\nThis brings us to the spring and summer of 399, to Socrates\u2019s\ntrial and execution. Twice in Plato\u2019s dialogues\n(Symposium 173b, Theaetetus 142c\u2013143a),\nfact-checking with Socrates took place as his friends sought to commit\nhis conversations to writing before he was executed. [spring\n399 Theaetetus] Prior to the action in the\nTheaetetus, a young poet named Meletus had composed a\ndocument charging Socrates with the capital crime of irreverence\n(asebeia): failure to show due piety toward the gods of\nAthens. This he delivered to Socrates in the presence of witnesses,\ninstructing Socrates to present himself before the king archon within\nfour days for a preliminary hearing (the same magistrate would later\npreside at the pre-trial examination and the trial). At the end of the\nTheaetetus, Socrates was on his way to that preliminary\nhearing. As a citizen, he had the right to countersue, the right to\nforgo the hearing, allowing the suit to proceed uncontested, and the\nright to exile himself voluntarily, as the personified laws later\nremind him (Crito 52c). Socrates availed himself of none of\nthese rights of citizenship. Rather, he set out to enter a plea and\nstopped at a gymnasium to talk to some youngsters about mathematics\nand knowledge.\n\nWhen he arrived at the king archon\u2019s stoa, Socrates fell into a\nconversation about reverence with a diviner he knew, Euthyphro\n[399 Euthyphro], and afterwards answered\nMeletus\u2019s charge. This preliminary hearing designated the\nofficial receipt of the case and was intended to lead to greater\nprecision in the formulation of the charge. In Athens, religion was a\nmatter of public participation under law, regulated by a calendar of\nreligious festivals; and the city used revenues to maintain temples\nand shrines. Socrates\u2019s irreverence, Meletus claimed, had\nresulted in the corruption of the city\u2019s young men\n(Euthyphro 3c\u2013d). Evidence for irreverence was of two\ntypes: Socrates did not believe in the gods of the Athenians (indeed,\nhe had said on many occasions that the gods do not lie or do other\nwicked things, whereas the Olympian gods of the poets and the city\nwere quarrelsome and vindictive); Socrates introduced new divinities\n(indeed, he insisted that his daimonion had spoken to him\nsince childhood). Meletus handed over his complaint, and Socrates\nentered his plea. The king-archon could refuse Meletus\u2019s case on\nprocedural grounds, redirect the complaint to an arbitrator, or accept\nit; he accepted it. Socrates had the right to challenge the\nadmissibility of the accusation in relation to existing law, but he\ndid not, so the charge was published on whitened tablets in the agora\nand a date was set for the pre-trial examination\u2014but not before\nSocrates fell into another conversation, this one on the origins of\nwords (Smith 2022). [399 Cratylus] From this\npoint, word spread rapidly, probably accounting for the spike of\ninterest in Socratic conversations recorded in Theaetetus and\nSymposium. [399 Symposium frame]\nBut Socrates nevertheless is shown by Plato spending the next day in\ntwo very long conversations promised in Theaetetus (210d).\n[399 Sophist, Statesman]\n\nAt the pre-trial examination, Meletus paid no court fees because it\nwas considered a public duty to prosecute irreverence. To discourage\nfrivolous suits, however, Athenian law imposed a heavy fine on\nplaintiffs who failed to obtain at least one fifth of the jury\u2019s\nvotes, as Socrates later points out (Apology 36a\u2013b).\nUnlike closely timed jury trials, pre-trial examinations encouraged\nquestions to and by the litigants, to make the legal issues more\nprecise. This procedure had become essential because of the\nsusceptibility of juries to bribery and misrepresentation. Originally\nintended to be a microcosm of the citizen body, juries by\nSocrates\u2019s time were manned by elderly, disabled, and\nimpoverished volunteers who needed the meager three-obol pay.\n\nIn the month of Thargelion [May-June 399\nApology] a month or two after Meletus\u2019s\ninitial summons, Socrates\u2019s trial occurred. On the day before,\nthe Athenians had launched a ship to Delos, dedicated to Apollo and\ncommemorating Theseus\u2019s legendary victory over the Minotaur\n(Phaedo 58a\u2013b). Spectators gathered along with the jury\n(Apology 25a) for a trial that probably lasted most of the\nday, each side timed by the water clock. Plato does not provide\nMeletus\u2019s prosecutorial speech or those of Anytus and Lycon, who\nhad joined in the suit; or the names of witnesses, if any\n(Apology 34a implies Meletus called none).\nApology\u2014the Greek \u2018apologia\u2019 means\n\u2018defense\u2019\u2014is not edited as are the court speeches of\norators. For example, there are no indications in the Greek text (at\n35d and 38b) that the two votes were taken; and there are no breaks\n(at 21a or 34b) for witnesses who may have been called. Also missing\nare speeches by Socrates\u2019s supporters; it is improbable that he\nhad none, even though Plato does not name them.\n\nSocrates, in his defense, mentioned the harm done to him by\nAristophanes\u2019s Clouds (\u00a72.1). Though Socrates\ndenied outright that he studied the heavens and what is below the\nearth, his familiarity with the investigations of natural philosophers\nand his own naturalistic explanations of such phenomena as earthquakes\nand eclipses make it no surprise that the jury remained unpersuaded.\nAnd, seeing Socrates out-argue Meletus, the jury probably did not make\nfine distinctions between philosophy and sophistry. Socrates three\ntimes took up the charge that he corrupted the young, insisting that,\nif he corrupted them, he did so unwillingly; but if unwillingly, he\nshould be instructed, not prosecuted (Apology 25e\u201326a).\nThe jury found him guilty. By his own argument, however, Socrates\ncould not blame the jury, for it was mistaken about what was truly in\nthe interest of the city (cf. Theaetetus 177d\u2013e) and\nthus required instruction.\n\nIn the penalty phase of the trial, Socrates said, \u201cIf it were\nthe law with us, as it is elsewhere, that a trial for life should not\nlast one but many days, you would be convinced, but now it is not easy\nto dispel great slanders in a short time\u201d (Apology\n37a\u2013b). This isolated complaint stands opposed to the remark of\nthe personified laws that Socrates was \u201cwronged not by us, the\nlaws, but by men\u201d (Crito 54c). It had been a crime\nsince 403/2 for anyone even to propose a law or decree in conflict\nwith the newly inscribed laws, so it was ironic for the laws to tell\nSocrates to persuade or obey them (Crito 51b\u2013c). In a\nlast-minute capitulation to his friends, he offered to allow them to\npay a fine of six times his net worth (Xenophon Oeconomicus\n2.3.4\u20135), thirty minae. The jury rejected the proposal.\nPerhaps the jury was too incensed by Socrates\u2019s words to vote\nfor the lesser penalty; after all, he needed to tell them more than\nonce to stop interrupting him. It is more likely, however, that\nsuperstitious jurors were afraid that the gods would be angry if they\nfailed to execute a man already found guilty of irreverence. Sentenced\nto death, Socrates reflected that it might be a blessing: either a\ndreamless sleep, or an opportunity to converse in the underworld.\n\nWhile the sacred ship was on its journey to Delos, no executions were\nallowed in the city. Although the duration of the annual voyage varied\nwith conditions, Xenophon says it took thirty-one days in 399\n(Memorabilia 4.8.2); if so, Socrates lived thirty days beyond\nhis trial, into the month of Skirophorion. A day or two before the\nend, Socrates\u2019s childhood friend Crito tried to persuade\nSocrates to escape. [June\u2013July 399\nCrito] Socrates replied that he \u201clistens to\nnothing \u2026 but the argument that on reflection seems best\u201d\nand that \u201cneither to do wrong or to return a wrong is ever\nright, not even to injure in return for an injury received\u201d\n(Crito 46b, 49d), not even under threat of death (cf.\nApology 32a), not even for one\u2019s family (Crito\n54b). Socrates could not point to a harm that would outweigh the harm\nhe would be inflicting on the city if he now exiled himself unlawfully\nwhen he could earlier have done so lawfully (Crito 52c); such\nlawbreaking would have confirmed the jury\u2019s judgment that he was\na corrupter of the young (Crito 53b\u2013c) and brought\nshame on his family and friends.\n\nThe events of Socrates\u2019s last day, when he \u201cappeared happy\nboth in manner and words as he died nobly and without fear\u201d\n(Phaedo 58e) were related by Phaedo to the Pythagorean\ncommunity at Phlius some weeks or months after the execution.\n[June\u2013July 399 Phaedo] The Eleven,\nprison officials chosen by lot, met with Socrates at dawn to tell him\nwhat to expect (Phaedo 59e\u201360b). When Socrates\u2019s\nfriends arrived, Xanthippe and their youngest child, Menexenus, were\nstill with him. Xanthippe commiserated with Socrates that he was about\nto enjoy his last conversation with his companions; then, performing\nthe ritual lamentation expected of women, was led home. Socrates spent\nthe day in philosophical conversation, defending the soul\u2019s\nimmortality and warning his companions not to restrain themselves in\nargument, \u201cIf you take my advice, you will give but little\nthought to Socrates but much more to the truth. If you think that what\nI say is true, agree with me; if not, oppose it with every\nargument\u201d (Phaedo 91b\u2013c). On the other hand, he\nwarned them sternly to restrain their emotions, \u201ckeep quiet and\ncontrol yourselves\u201d (Phaedo 117e).\n\nSocrates had no interest in whether his corpse was burned or buried,\nbut he bathed at the prison\u2019s cistern so the women of his\nhousehold would be spared from having to wash his corpse. After\nmeeting with his family again in the late afternoon, he rejoined his\ncompanions. The servant of the Eleven, a public slave, bade Socrates\nfarewell by calling him \u201cthe noblest, the gentlest, and the\nbest\u201d of men (Phaedo 116c). The poisoner described the\nphysical effects of the Conium maculatum variety of hemlock\nused for citizen executions (Bloch 2001), then Socrates cheerfully\ntook the cup and drank. Phaedo, a former slave echoing the slave of\nthe Eleven, called Socrates, \u201cthe best, \u2026 the wisest and\nthe most upright\u201d (Phaedo 118a).\n4. Socrates outside philosophy\n\nSocrates is an inescapable figure in intellectual history worldwide.\nReaders interested in tracking this might start with Trapp\u2019s two\nvolumes (2007). Strikingly, Socrates is invoked also in nonacademic\ncontexts consistently over centuries, across geographical and\nlinguistic boundaries globally, and throughout a wide range of media\nand forms of cultural production.\n\nThough not commonplace today, Socrates was once routinely cited\nalongside Jesus. Consider Benjamin Franklin\u2019s pithy maxim in his\nAutobiography, \u201cHumility: Imitate Jesus and\nSocrates,\u201d and the way the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.,\ndefends civil disobedience in Letter from Birmingham Jail by\narguing that those who blame him for bringing imprisonment on himself\nare like those who would condemn Socrates for provoking the Athenians\nto execute him or condemn Jesus for having triggered his crucifixion.\nIn the visual arts, artist Bror Hjorth celebrates Walt Whitman by\ngiving him Jesus and Socrates as companions. This wood relief,\nLove, Peace and Work, was commissioned in the early 1960s by\nthe Swedish Workers\u2019 Educational Association for installation in\nits new building in Stockholm and was selected to appear on a 1995\npostage stamp. A more light-hearted linking is Greece\u2019s entry\ninto the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, Elpida\u2019s Socrates\nSuperstar, the lyrics of which mention that Socrates was earlier\nthan Jesus.\n\nAt times, commending Socrates asserted the distinctiveness of Western\nCivilization. For example, an illustrated essay on Socrates\ninaugurates a 1963 feature called \u201cThey Made Our World\u201d in\nLOOK, a popular U.S. magazine. Today Socrates remains an icon\nof the Western ideal of an intellectual and is sometimes invoked as\nrepresentative of the ideal of a learned person more universally.\nWhether he is being poked fun at, extolled, pilloried, or just\nacknowledged, Socrates features in a wide range of projects intended\nfor broad audiences as a symbol of the very idea of the life of the\nmind, which, necessarily from a Socratic viewpoint, is also a moral\nlife (but not necessarily a conventionally successful life). \n\nThere may be no more succinct expression of this standing than James\nMadison\u2019s comments on the tyrannical impulses of crowds in\nFederalist 55: \u201cHad every Athenian citizen been a\nSocrates; every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.\u201d\nThe persistence of this position in the cultural imagination is clear\nin his many appearances as a sober knower (e.g., Roberto\nRossellini\u2019s 1971 film) and a giant among giants, as in, for\nexample, his imagined speech, penned by Gilbert Murray, where he is\nplaced first among the \u201cimmortals\u201d featured in the 1953\nrecording, This I Believe,compiled by journalist Edward R.\nMurrow and linked to his wildly successful radio broadcast of the same\nname. But Socrates also persistently appears in funny settings. For\nexample, an artist makes the literally brainless, good-natured\nscarecrow featured in the 1961 animation, Tales from the Wizard of\nOz, answer to the name \u2018Socrates\u2019; and the Beatles\nmake Jeremy Hillary Boob, Ph.D., their sweet fictional character in\nthe 1968 film Yellow Submarine, respond to a question with\nthe quip, \u201cA true Socratic query, that!\u201d A more robust\nrecent example that mobilizes the longevity of Socrates\u2019\nassociation with reflection and ethical behavior is Walter\nMosley\u2019s crime fiction featuring Socrates Fortlow. His three\nbooks follow a Black ex-con in Los Angeles with a violent past and a\nfierce determination to live life as a thinking person and to do good;\nthe character says his mother named him \u2018Socrates\u2019 because\nshe wanted him to grow up smart, a reference to a naming custom\npracticed by former slaves. The association of Socrates with great\nintellect and moral rectitude is still kicking, as a quick glance at\nthe collection of Socrates-themed merchandise available from a wide\narray of vendors will attest. Further, in the mode of \u201cthe\nexception proves the rule,\u201d observe that in DC Comics, Mr.\nSocrates is a criminal genius able to control Superman by subduing him\nwith a device that disables him mentally. \n\nIn antiquity, Socrates did not act as a professional teacher of\ndoctrines; he did, however, self-identify as a knowledge-seeker for\nthe sake of himself and the benefit of those with whom he engaged,\nyoung or not. So firmly entrenched internationally in today\u2019s\nvernacular is his association with education that his name is used to\nbrand professional enterprises as varied as curricula designed for\nelementary school, college, law school, institutional initiatives that\nserve multiple disciplines, think tank retreats, caf\u00e9\ngatherings, electronic distance learning platforms, training programs\nfor financial and marketing consultants, some parts of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy, and easy-to-use online legal services. We find a\nless commercial example in Long Walk to Freedom (1994)\nin which the great South African statesman Nelson Mandela reports\nthat, during his incarceration for anti-apartheid activism, his fellow\nprisoners educated themselves while laboring in rock quarries and that\n\u201cthe style of teaching was Socratic in nature;\u201d a leader\nwould pose a question for them to discuss in study sessions. Another\nexample is Elliniko Theatro\u2019s Socrates Now, a solo\nperformance based on Plato\u2019s Apology that integrates\naudience discussion.\n\nIn U.S. education at all levels these days, Socratic questioning\nimplies no effort on the part of a leading figure to elicit from\nthe participants any severe discomfort with current opinions\n(that is, to sting like a gadfly or to expose a disquieting truth),\nbut instead uses the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 to invest with\ngravitas collaborative learning that addresses moral questions and\nrelies on interactive techniques. The unsettling and dangerous aspects\nof Socratic practice turn up in politicized contexts where a\ndistinction between dissent and disloyalty is at issue. Appeals to\nSocrates in these settings most often highlight the personal risks run\nby an intellectually exemplary critic of the unjust acts of an\nestablished authority. This is a recurring theme in politically minded\nallusions to Socrates globally. A wave of such work took hold in the\nU.S., Britain and Canada around WWII, the McCarthy Era, and Cold War.\nCreative artists in literature, radio, theater, and television\nsummoned Socrates to probe what it means to be an unyielding advocate\nof free speech and free inquiry\u2014even a martyr to belief in the\nnecessity of these freedoms to meaningful and virtuous human life. In\nthese sources, his strange appearance, behavior, and views, especially\nhis relentlessly critical, even irritating, truth-seeking, and\nanti-ideological posture are presented as testing Athenian\ndemocracy\u2019s capacity to abide by these ideals. They suggest that\nthe indictment, trial, and execution are stains on Athenian democracy\nand that a worrisome historical parallel is unfolding. These\nfull-blown interpretations of the life of Socrates require wrestling\nwith the whole issue of the historical Socrates; a claim to historical\naccuracy was a crucial part of any case for his story\u2019s being\ncredible as a warning. \n\nVisually, we find monuments and other sculptural tributes to a less\novertly political Socrates in cities and small towns across the globe\nin public spaces devoted to learning and contemplation. A stand-out\nfor its unusual focus is Antonio Canova\u2019s 1797 bas-relief,\n\u201cSocrates rescues Alcibiades in the battle of Potidaea,\u201d\nin which Socrates strikes a powerful pose as a hoplite. An 1875 piece\nby Russian imperial sculptor Mark Antokolski foregrounds the personal\ncost of Socrates\u2019s commitment to philosophy, portraying him\nalone, a drained cup of hemlock at his side, slumped over dead.\nReproductions of, and drawings based on, ancient copies of what are\nthought to be a fourth-century B.C.E. statue of Socrates by the\nAthenian Lysippus (e.g., the British Museum\u2019s Statuette of\nSocrates) are also in wide circulation. A particularly interesting one\ncan be found in graphic artist Ralph Steadman\u2019s\nParanoids, a 1986 book of Polaroid caricatures of famous\npeople. But the most influential image of the philosopher today is the\nriveting, widely reproduced, 1787 painting, \u201cThe Death of\nSocrates,\u201d by Jacques Louis David, now in the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It captures the\nphilosopher\u2019s own claim to be reverent, his courageous decision\nto take the cup of hemlock in his own hand, and the grief his unjust\nfate stirred in others. \n\nDavid\u2019s neo-classical history-painting has come to be a defining\nimage of Socrates. This is curious because, while the design of the\npainting abounds with careful references to the primary sources, it\nignores those sources\u2019 description of Socrates himself \u2014\nthe ones cited in section 1 on Socrates\u2019s strangeness \u2014\nrendering the old philosopher classically handsome instead. Attending\nto the primary sources has led some readers to wonder whether Socrates\nmight have had an African heritage. For example, in the 1921\n\u201cThe Foolish and the Wise: Sallie Runner is Introduced to\nSocrates,\u201d a short story in the NAACP journal edited by W. E. B.\nDu Bois, author Leila Amos Pendleton tackles the issue. Her character,\na bright girl employed as a maid, responds to her employer\u2019s\naccount of the physical appearance of the great man born before Jesus\nthat Miss Audrey intends to tell Sallie all about: \u201cHe was a\ncullod gentmun, warn\u2019t he?\u201d This prompts the following\nexchange: \u201cOh no, Sallie, he wasn\u2019t colored.\u201d\n\u201cWal, ef he been daid all dat long time, Miss Oddry, how kin\nyo\u2019 tell his color?\u201d \u201cWhy he was an Athenian,\nSallie. He lived in Greece.\u201d Nails (1989) depicted Socrates as\nan African village elder in a recreation of Republic 1. In\nthe visual arts, drawings and watercolors by the Swiss artist Hans\nErni resolutely portray Socrates as ugly as the sources describe him.\nSocrates also sometimes resonates as Black (or queer, or touched),\nindependent of any discussion of physical attributes; this follows\nfrom his renown for refusing to be defined by the stultifying norms of\nhis day. \n\nIn Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates says a recurring dream\ninstructs him to \u201ccompose music and work at it\u201d and that\nhe had always interpreted it to mean something like keep doing\nphilosophy because \u201cphilosophy was the greatest kind of music\nand that\u2019s what I was working at\u201d (60e\u201361a). In\nprison awaiting execution, he says he experimented with new ways of\ndoing philosophy; he tried turning some of Aesop\u2019s fables into\nverse. We might view some of the deeply thoughtful, even loving,\nengagements with Socrates in music and dance in light of this passage.\n\u201cSocrates\u201d is the fifth movement of Leonard\nBernstein\u2019s Serenade after Plato\u2019s Symposium\n(1954). He is the explicit inspiration for two works of choreography\nby Mark Morris, Death of Socrates in 1983, and\nSocrates in 2010, both of which work with 1919 compositions\nby Erik Satie that directly reference Socrates. And we have a work\nproduced in 2022 at HERE in New York, The Hang, the stunning\nproduct of a collaboration by playwright Taylor Mac and composer Matt\nRay.\n\nConjurings of Socrates appear outside philosophy as both brief but\ndense references to discrete features of this puzzling figure, and\nsustained portraits that wrestle with his enigmatic character.
