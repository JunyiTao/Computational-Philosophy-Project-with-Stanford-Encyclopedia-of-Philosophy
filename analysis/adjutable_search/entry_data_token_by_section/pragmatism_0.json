    "main_text": "The Meaning of Pragmatism: James\n1. The Meaning of Pragmatism: James \n\nPragmatism\u2019s key ideas originated in discussions at a so-called\n\u2018Metaphysical Club\u2019 that met in Harvard around 1870. (For\na popular history of this group, see Menand 1998.) Peirce and James\nparticipated in these discussions along with some other philosophers,\npsychologists and philosophically inclined lawyers. Peirce then\ndeveloped these ideas in publications from the 1870s, and they\nachieved prominence through a series of public lectures given by James\nin 1898. Both James and Peirce used \u2018pragmatism\u2019 as the\nname of a method, principle, or \u2018maxim\u2019 for clarifying\nconcepts and hypotheses and for identifying empty disputes, though we\nshall see significant differences in how they understood it.\n\nWhen William James published a series of lectures on\n\u2018Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking\u2019 in\n1907, he began by identifying \u2018The Present Dilemma in\nPhilosophy\u2019 (1907: 9ff), a fundamental and apparently\nirresoluble clash between two ways of thinking, which he promised\npragmatism would overcome. James begins by observing that the history\nof philosophy is \u2018to a great extent that of a certain clash of\nhuman temperaments\u2019: the \u2018tough-minded\u2019 and the\n\u2018tender-minded\u2019. The tough-minded have an empiricist\ncommitment to experience and going by \u2018the facts\u2019, while\nthe tender-minded prefer a priori principles which appeal to\nratiocination. The tender-minded tend to be idealistic, optimistic and\nreligious, believing in free will, while the tough-minded are\nmaterialist, pessimistic, irreligious, dogmatic and fatalistic.\n\nBy the early twentieth century, James notes, \u2018our children\n\u2026 are almost born scientific\u2019 (1907: 14f). But this has\nnot weakened religious belief. People need a philosophy that is both\nempiricist in its adherence to facts yet finds room for faith. But all\nthat is on offer is \u2018an empirical philosophy that is not\nreligious enough and a religious philosophy that is not empirical\nenough\u2026\u2019 (1907: 15f). The challenge is to show how to\nreconcile \u2018the scientific loyalty to facts\u2019 with\n\u2018the old confidence in human values and the resultant\nspontaneity, whether of the religious or of the romantic type.\u2019\nPragmatism is presented as the \u2018mediating philosophy\u2019: we\nneed to show how adherence to tough-minded epistemic standards does\nnot prevent our adopting the kind of worldview to which the\ntender-minded aspire. Once we use what he introduced as the\n\u2018pragmatic method\u2019 to clarify our understanding of truth,\nof free will, or of religious belief the disputes\u2014which we\ndespaired of settling intellectually\u2014begin to dissolve. William\nJames thus presented pragmatism as a \u2018method for settling\nmetaphysical disputes that might otherwise be interminable.\u2019\n(1907: 28) Unless some \u2018practical difference\u2019 would follow\nfrom one or the other side\u2019s being correct, the dispute is\nidle.\n\n[T]he tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions,\nhowever subtle, is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist\nin anything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect\nclearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider\nwhat conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may\ninvolve\u2014what sensations we are to expect from it, and what\nreactions we must prepare. (1907: 29)\n\n\nThe lectures explained this with a memorable illustration. On a visit\nto the mountains, James\u2019 friends engage in a \u2018ferocious\nmetaphysical dispute\u2019 about a squirrel that was hanging on one\nside of a tree trunk while a human observer was standing on the other\nside:\n\nThis human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving\nrapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel\nmoves as fast in the opposite direction, and always keeps the tree\nbetween himself and the man, so that never a glimpse of him is caught.\nThe resultant metaphysical problem now is this: Does the man go\nround the squirrel or not? (1907: 27f)\n\n\nJames proposed that which answer is correct depends on what you\n\u2018practically mean\u2019 by \u2018going round\u2019. If you\nmean passing from north of the squirrel, east, south, then west, then\nthe answer to the question is \u2018yes\u2019. If, on the other\nhand, you mean in front of him, to his right, behind him, to his left,\nand then in front of him again, then the answer is \u2018no\u2019.\nAfter pragmatic clarification disambiguates the question, all dispute\ncomes to an end. So James offers his pragmatism as a technique for\nclarifying concepts and hypotheses so that metaphysical disputes that\nappear irresoluble will be dissolved. A good example is the dispute\nbetween free will and determinism: once we compare the practical\nconsequences of both positions we find no conflict. As James admitted,\nhe explained the pragmatic method through examples rather than a\ndetailed analysis of what it involves. He did little to explain\nexactly what \u2018practical consequences\u2019 are. He also made no\nclaim to originality: \u2018Pragmatism represents a perfectly\nfamiliar attitude in philosophy, the empiricist attitude\u2019,\nalthough he acknowledged that it did so \u2018in a more radical and\nin a less objectionable form than it has ever yet assumed\u2019\n(1907: 31). It shared with other forms of empiricism an\n\u2018anti-intellectualist tendency\u2019 (ibid), and it recognized\nthat theories (and presumably concepts) should be viewed as\n\u2018instruments, not answers to enigmas\u2019.\n",
