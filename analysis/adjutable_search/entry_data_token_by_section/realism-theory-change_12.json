    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || Induction or Deduction?\n2.9 A New Induction\n\nStanford (2006) has aimed to replace PI with what he calls the\n\u2018new induction\u2019 on the history of science, according to\nwhich past historical evidence of transient underdetermination of\ntheories by evidence makes it likely that current theories will be\nsupplanted by hitherto unknown (unconceived) ones, which nonetheless,\nare such that when they are formulated, they will be at least as well\nconfirmed by the evidence as the current ones. But the new induction\nis effective, if at all, only in tandem with PI. For if there is\ncontinuity in our scientific image of the world, the hitherto\nunconceived theories that will replace the current ones won\u2019t be\nthe radical rivals they are portrayed to\n be.[13]\n\nWhen it comes to the realist commitment to theories, the proper\nphilosophical task is to ignore neither the first order scientific\nevidence that there is for a given theory nor the lessons that can be\nlearned from the history of science. Rather, the task is to balance\nthe first-order and the second order of evidence. The first-order\nevidence is typically associated with whatever scientists take\ninto account when they form an epistemic attitude towards a theory. It\ncan be broadly understood to include some of the theoretical virtues\nof the theory at hand\u2014of the kind that typically go into\nplausibility judgments associated with assignment of prior probability\nto theories. The second-order evidence comes from the past\nrecord of scientific theories and/or from meta-theoretical\n(philosophical) considerations that have to do with the reliability of\nscientific methodology. It concerns not particular scientific\ntheories, but science as a whole. This second-order evidence feeds\nclaims such as those that motivate PI or the New Induction. Actually,\nthis second-order evidence is multi-faceted\u2014it is negative\n(showing limitations and shortcomings) as well as positive (showing\nhow learning from experience can be improved).\n",
