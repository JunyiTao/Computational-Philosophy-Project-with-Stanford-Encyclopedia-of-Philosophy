Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition\n\nOne of the ways in which philosophy connects to the study of animal\ncognition has to do with the fact that, as with any science, there are\nnumerous philosophical assumptions embedded in the practice of\ncomparative cognition research. Scientists, like all humans, make\nchoices about how to use terms, they are swayed to formulate questions\nand seek data given the values they have, they have assumptions about\nthe topics under study, as well as views about what makes for a\nscientifically respectable interpretation of data and the virtues of a\ngood scientific explanation. Scientists have the goal of seeking\nobjectivity, but seeking objectivity can itself introduce new biases,\nas we know from work in the philosophy of science on objectivity and\nfeminist philosophy of science. This is as true in animal cognition\nresearch as in any other science (Andrews 2020c).\n\nPhilosophical assumptions in animal cognition research are present,\nmost obviously, in how the capacities under study are defined. For\ninstance, when scientists embark on an experimental project to\ndetermine whether a certain species has capacities such as altruism,\ncooperation, or empathy, they assume a certain definition of these\nterms. These definitions are often operational, meaning that they\nfocus on the behavioral or physiological reactions that one would have\nto see in an animal to confirm that they possess this capacity. But\neven operational definitions come with philosophical baggage. For\ninstance, some scientists consider that finding emotional contagion in\nan animal is enough to claim that that species is capable of empathy.\nThis presupposes that a particular philosophical account of empathy is\ntrue, and not others. Some phenomenological accounts of empathy, for\ninstance, do not require emotional state-matching (Zahavi &\nOvergaard 2012), and so, under these accounts, finding emotional\ncontagion in an animal would not suffice to claim that they are\ncapable of empathy.\n\nSimply stating how one uses a particular term might seem to be good\nscience, for this is thought to offer clarity regarding what exactly\nis being studied. Terms are often defined without any argumentation,\nor simply by reproducing the definition given by another scientist or\none that is generally accepted in a certain scientific tradition.\nHowever, different definitions come with different assumptions and\nimplications. They can establish which animals we study in search for\na certain capacity, the methods we use to study it, and what counts as\nevidence for that capacity. Moreover, determining that an animal has\nthis or that capacity can have profound ethical implications, so how\nwe choose to use our terms is far from normatively neutral.\n\nThis discussion of how terms are used in science is a starting point\nfor understanding the theory-ladenness and value-ladenness of science.\nConsiderations from the philosophy of science can help to bring to\nlight how the choices scientists make impact the research. We will\nnext consider how value-ladenness, theory-ladenness, concerns about\nobjectivity, and appeals to the virtue of simplicity impact\ncomparative cognition research.\n",
