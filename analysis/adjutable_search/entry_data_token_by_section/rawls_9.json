    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Reasonable Pluralism and the Public Political Culture\n3.3 Reasonable Pluralism and the Public Political Culture\n\nRawls\u2019s account of the reasonable citizen highlights his view of\nhuman nature. Humans are not irredeemably self-centered, dogmatic, or\ndriven by what Hobbes called, \u201ca perpetual and restless desire\nof power after power\u201d (1651, 58). Humans have at least the\ncapacity for genuine toleration and mutual respect.\n\nThis human capacity raises the hope that the diversity of worldviews\nin a democratic society may represent not merely pluralism, but\nreasonable pluralism. Rawls hopes, that is, that the\nreligious, moral, and philosophical doctrines that citizens accept\nwill themselves endorse toleration and accept the essentials of a\ndemocratic regime. In the religious sphere, for example, a reasonable\npluralism might contain a reasonable Catholicism, a reasonable\ninterpretation of Islam, a reasonable atheism, and so on. Being\nreasonable, none of these doctrines will advocate the use of coercive\npolitical power to impose religious conformity on citizens with\ndifferent beliefs.\n\nThe possibility of reasonable pluralism softens but does not solve the\nchallenge of legitimacy: how one law can legitimately be imposed on\ndiverse citizens. For even in a society of reasonable pluralism, it\nwould be unreasonable to expect everyone to endorse, say, a reasonable\nCatholicism as the basis for a constitutional settlement. Reasonable\nMuslims or atheists cannot be expected to endorse Catholicism as\nsetting the basic terms for social life. Nor, of course, can Catholics\nbe expected to accept Islam or atheism as the fundamental basis of\nlaw. No comprehensive doctrine can be accepted by all\nreasonable citizens, and so no comprehensive doctrine can serve as the\nbasis for the legitimate use of coercive political power.\n\nYet where else then to turn to find the ideas that will define\nsociety\u2019s most basic laws, which all citizens will be required\nto obey? For Rawls, there is only one source of fundamental ideas that\ncan serve as a focal point for all reasonable citizens of a liberal\nsociety. This is the society\u2019s public political\nculture.\n\nSince justification is addressed to others, it proceeds from what is,\nor can be, held in common; and so we begin from shared fundamental\nideas implicit in the public political culture in the hope of\ndeveloping from them a political conception that can gain free and\nreasoned agreement in judgment (PL, 100\u201301).\n\n\nThe public political culture of a democratic society, Rawls says,\n\u201ccomprises the political institutions of a constitutional regime\nand the public traditions of their interpretation (including those of\nthe judiciary), as well as historic texts and documents that are\ncommon knowledge\u201d (PL, 13\u201314). Rawls looks to\nfundamental ideas implicit, for example, in the constitution\u2019s\nlist of individual rights, in the design of the society\u2019s\ngovernment, and in the historic decisions of important courts. These\nfundamental ideas from the public political culture can be crafted\ninto a shared political conception of justice.\n",
