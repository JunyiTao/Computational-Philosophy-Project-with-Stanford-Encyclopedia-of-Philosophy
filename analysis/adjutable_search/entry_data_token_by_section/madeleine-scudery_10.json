    "main_text": "Philosophy || Philosophy of Gender\n4. Reception and Interpretation\n\nToward the end of her long life, Scud\u00e9ry faced the mixed\nreception which would be the destiny of her works for centuries to\ncome. Her writings, especially her novels, reached an enormous\ncultivated public. Thousands of readers anxiously awaited the\nappearance of a new chapter in the serials. The royalties and\ngovernment pensions attached to her writings permitted her to live\ncomfortably in the fashionable Marais neighborhood. The translation of\nher works into English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Arabic indicates\nthe breadth of her appreciative public. But an influential literary\nelite dismissed her works as illegible and unintelligible.\nMoli\u00e8re, Fureti\u00e8re, and Boileau caricatured\nScud\u00e9ry as a pendant whose picaresque tales and inconclusive\ndialogues only masked intellectual confusion. A leading literary\ncritic, Nicolas Boileau\u2019s criticism proved especially\ninfluential in subsequent dismissals of the thought of Scud\u00e9ry.\nIn Satire X, Boileau argues that the type of love celebrated\nby Scud\u00e9ry is immoral. \n\n\nYou can see this in Cl\u00e9lie, where the heroine receives\nher lovers under the delicate name of friend. At first, she only takes\nsmall, permissible liberties. But soon you are in deep waters on the\nriver of Tendre and you can navigate at will. [OC,\n67] \n\n\nBoileau\u2019s critique in Dialogue on Heroes of the Novel\nis more categorical. He denounces Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s works \n\n\nfor their lack of seriousness, for their airs, for their vague and\nsuperficial dialogues, for their fawning portraits of quite mediocre\npeople, even on occasion very ugly people, and for their interminable\nand verbose effusions on love. [OC, 445] \n\n\nThis critical portrait has remained influential in the negative\nappraisal of Scud\u00e9ry down to the present.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the rehabilitation of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s intellectual reputation began. President of the\nSorbonne, Victor Cousin (1858) studied how Scudery\u2019s writings\nreflected the salon society of the period. Despite his own\nphilosophical pedigree, however, Cousin evinced more interest in\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s role as salon hostess than in her own\nphilosophical theories. The current revival of interest in\nScud\u00e9ry is tied to the contemporary feminist expansion of the\ncanon of the humanities in order to include the voices of women\nauthors who had been neglected due to misogynist bias. The new English\ntranslations and commentaries by Newman (2003) and Donawerth and\nStrongson (2004) focus on the writings of Scud\u00e9ry treating\nissues of gender. Recent studies by Beasley (1990), De Jean (1991),\nDuggan (2017), Goldsmith (1988), Harth (1992), and Timmermans (1993)\nhave situated the works and theories of Scud\u00e9ry in the context\nof women\u2019s writing, salon culture, and the various attitudes\ntoward women in the France of early modernity. Burch (2013) examines\nin what sense she can be considered a philosopher, specifically a\n\u201cfemme philosophe\u201d of the period. Hogg (2018) and Suzuki\n(2018) analyze her political theory while Duggan (2016) and Sahlins\n(2015) explore her approach to science. Although these contemporary\neditions of and commentaries on Scud\u00e9ry have underscored the\ngendered nature of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophy, they have tended\nto neglect other dimensions of her thought. Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nphilosophy of virtue, religion, art, and knowledge invites further\nexploration.\n",
