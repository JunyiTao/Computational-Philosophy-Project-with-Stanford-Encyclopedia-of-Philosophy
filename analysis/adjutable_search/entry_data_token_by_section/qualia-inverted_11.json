    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026For Modes of Presentation\n3.4 \u2026For Modes of Presentation\n\n\nAn illustration of \u201cFrege\u2019s puzzle\u201d is this. It is\napparently possible to believe that Michael Caine is a Cockney, while\nnot believing that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. But how can this\nbe, since Michael Caine and Maurice Micklewhite are the same\nindividual?\n\n\nAccording to many philosophers, appearances are not misleading, and\nthe two beliefs really are different: specifically, they represent the\nvery same individual, the beloved star of Alfie, in different\nways, or under different modes of presentation. On this view, the\npropositional content of a belief is a Fregean Thought, with modes of\npresentation as constituents\u2014as opposed to a structured\nRussellian proposition, with objects and properties as\n constituents.[42]\n Put differently but connectedly, the\nexample shows that the names \u2018Michael Caine\u2019 and\n\u2018Maurice Micklewhite\u2019 have different Fregean\nsenses\u2014their semantic values cannot simply be their\nreferents.\n\n\nA similar issue arises in the philosophy of perception (see, e.g.,\nBoghossian and Velleman 1991, Peacocke 2001, Thau 2002). When one looks\nat a cucumber, does the propositional content of one\u2019s experience have\na constituent that is a \u201cmode of presentation\u201d of greenness\n(a neo-Fregean view) or does it instead simply contain the property\ngreenness itself? Using the familiar ordered pair notation for\npropositional content (see, e.g., Thau 2002, 83), and ignoring issues\nabout whether the cucumber itself is associated with a mode of\npresentation, the dispute may be put as follows. On the neo-Fregean\nview, the content of one\u2019s experience of the cucumber is \\(\\langle\\)the\ncucumber, \\(\\mathrm{MOP_{greenness}} \\rangle\\); on the neo-Russellian view, the\ncontent of one\u2019s experiences is \\(\\langle\\)the cucumber, greenness\\(\\rangle\\).\n\n\nRecall the third premise of argument B (see the previous two\nsubsections):\n\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal\ndifference between Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the\ncolors that their experiences represent the tomato as\nhaving.\n\n\nAs explained in subsection 3.3, one may resist P3 by claiming that\ncolor experience represents appearance properties. That\namounts to a defense of representationalism by introducing a\ndistinction \u201cat the level of reference\u201d. However, P3 may\nalso be denied by introducing a distinction \u201cat the level of\nsense\u201d. On this view, the difference between Invert and Nonvert\nis like the difference\u2014as the Fregean has it\u2014between\nIan, who believes that Michael Caine is a Cockney, and Nan, who\nbelieves that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. On this Fregean view of\nthe content of perception, the difference between Invert\u2019s and\nNonvert\u2019s experiences is that they represent the very same property,\nnamely redness, in different ways, or under different modes of\npresentation.\n\n\nThau 2002 argues against modes of presentation (and also points out\nthe close connections between the inverted spectrum and Frege\u2019s\npuzzle). Chalmers 2004 and Block 2007 defend a Fregean view.\n",
