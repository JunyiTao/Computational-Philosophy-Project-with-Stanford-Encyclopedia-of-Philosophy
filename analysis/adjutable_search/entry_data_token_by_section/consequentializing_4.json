    "main_text": "Three Motives for, and Types of, Consequentializing || Notational Consequentializing\n3.2 Notational Consequentializing\n\nSome are motivated to consequentialize out of a desire to establish\nboth that the consequentialist/non-consequentialist distinction is\nunimportant and that there is nothing uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism (see Dreier 2011 and Louise 2004). Because these\nphilosophers hold that the act-consequentialist counterpart of a\ntarget non-consequentialist theory is a mere notational variant on\nthat theory, I\u2019ll call them notational\nconsequentializers. They give what\u2019s known as the\nassimilation argument for consequentializing (S. A. Schroeder\n2017: 1480):\n\nEvery plausible non-consequentialist theory has an\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory such that the two are\nnecessarily co-extensive in their deontic verdicts (Dreier 2011:\n104\u2013111).\nIf an act-consequentialist theory and a non-consequentialist\ntheory are necessarily co-extensive in their deontic verdicts, then\nthey are equivalent in the strong sense of being mere notational\nvariants of each other, just as the view that the average kinetic\nenergy of the molecules in a pot of boiling water at one atmosphere of\npressure is 100 degrees Celsius is a mere notational variant of the\nview that the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a pot of\nboiling water at one atmosphere of pressure is 212 degrees Fahrenheit\n(Dreier 2011: 111\u2013115).\nIf every plausible non-consequentialist theory is a mere\nnotational variant of some extensionally equivalent\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory, then the\nconsequentialism/non-consequentialism distinction is unimportant (and,\nindeed, empty), for every plausible moral theory has, then, both an\nact-consequentialist notational variant and a non-consequentialist\nnotational variant (Dreier 2011: 114\u2013115).\nThus, the consequentialism/non-consequentialism distinction is\nunimportant (and, indeed, empty).\n\n\nThe first two premises are the most controversial. And, so,\nwe\u2019ll examine objections to each of them in\n section 4.2\n and\n section 4.5,\n respectively.\n\nBut, for now, let us examine why the notational consequentializer\nthinks that the first premise is true. It\u2019s because they have\nhigh hopes for what\u2019s known as the Footian Procedure\n(Portmore 2011: 112), a procedure for generating an\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory for any plausible target\nnon-consequentialist theory. To follow this procedure, we simply\ncombine act-consequentialism\u2019s view that an act is permissible\nif and only if its outcome is not outranked by that of any available\nalternative with the assumption that an act\u2019s outcome is not\noutranked by that of any available alternative if and only if it is\nF, where \u201cF\u201d stands for whatever feature\nof actions that the target non-consequentialist theory takes to be the\nultimate right-maker (e.g., \u201cshowing the proper respect for\nhumanity\u201d in the case of Kantianism). In other words, we\ngenerate a ranking of outcomes as follows: we rank the outcome of\nevery act that the target non-consequentialist theory takes to be\npermissible above the outcome of every available alternative that the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory takes to be impermissible.\nWhat\u2019s more, if the target non-consequentialist theory allows\nthat some acts are morally better than others in that we have more\nmoral reason to perform them than to perform those others, then we\nrank their outcomes above those of the others, and we do so by\nwhatever degree the target non-consequentialist theory takes them to\nbe morally better. Because, on this procedure, whether one outcome\noutranks another on the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheory just depends on whether the act that would produce the one is,\non the target non-consequentialist theory, morally better than the act\nthat would produce the other, it guarantees that the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory delivers, in every possible\nworld, the same deontic verdicts that the target non-consequentialist\ntheory yields.\n\nBut this procedure doesn\u2019t guarantee that the first premise in\nthe assimilation argument is true. For it may not always be possible\nto employ the Footian Procedure. It won\u2019t be possible if the\nstructural features of the target non-consequentialist theory\u2019s\nmorally-better relation are incompatible with those of\nact-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of outcomes (see Brown 2011). To\nillustrate, suppose that act-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of\noutcomes must be transitive, whereas the target non-consequentialist\ntheory\u2019s morally-better relation is intransitive. For suppose\nthat the target non-consequentialist theory holds:\n\nthat act A is morally better than act B,\nthat act B is morally better than act C,\nbut\nthat act C is morally better than act A.\n\n\nIn that case, there will be no way to employ the Footian Procedure to\nconsequentialize this non-consequentialist theory if\nact-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of outcomes must be\ntransitive.\n\nIn any case, notational consequentializing aims to use the Footian\nProcedure, if possible, to demonstrate that every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory has an extensionally equivalent\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory with the goal of establishing\nthat, in every instance, the target non-consequentialist theory and\nthe resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory are mere\nnotational variants of each other. In doing this, the notational\nconsequentializer hopes to establish that the\nconsequentialist/non-consequentialist distinction is unimportant (and,\nindeed, empty). And this would mean that there is nothing uniquely\ncompelling about act-consequentialism and, so, no reason (or, at\nleast, no non-pragmatic reason) for us to consequentialize rather\nthan, say, Kantianize (cf. Dreier 2011: 115).\n",
