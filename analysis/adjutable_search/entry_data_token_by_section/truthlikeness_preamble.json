    "main_text": "\n\nTruth is widely held to be the constitutive aim of inquiry.\nEven those who think the aim of inquiry is something more accessible\nthan the truth (such as the empirically discernible truth), as well as\nthose who think the aim is something more robust than possessing truth\n(such as the possession of knowledge) still affirm truth as a\nnecessary component of the end of inquiry. And, other things being\nequal, it seems better to end an inquiry by endorsing the truth rather\nthan falsehoods.\n\nEven if there is something to the thought that inquiry aims at truth,\nit has to be admitted that truth is a rather coarse-grained property\nof propositions. Some falsehoods seem to realize the aim of getting at\nthe truth better than others. Some truths better realize the aim than\nother truths. And perhaps some falsehoods even realize the aim better\nthan some truths do. The dichotomy of the class of propositions into\ntruths and falsehoods needs to be supplemented with a more\nfine-grained ordering \u2013 one which classifies propositions\naccording to their closeness to the truth, their degree of\ntruthlikeness, or their verisimilitude.\n\nWe begin with the logical problem of truthlikeness: the problem of\ngiving an adequate account of the concept and determining its logical\nproperties. In \u00a71 we lay at the logical problem and various\npossible solutions to it. In \u00a71.1 we examine the basic\nassumptions which generate the logical problem, which in part explains\nwhy the problem emerged when it did. Attempted solutions to the\nproblem quickly proliferated, but they can be gathered together under\nthree broad lines of attack. The first two, the content\napproach (\u00a71.2) and the consequence approach\n(\u00a71.3), were both initiated by Popper in his ground-breaking\nwork; although Popper\u2019s specific proposals did not capture the\nintuitive concept (and were technically inadequate), the content and\nconsequence approaches are still being actively developed and refined.\nThe third, the likeness (or similarity)\napproach, takes the likeness in\ntruthlikeness seriously; the main results and problems facing\nthe likeness approach are outlined in \u00a71.4.\n\nThere are two further problems of truthlikeness, both of which\npresuppose the solution of the logical problem. One is the\nepistemological problem of truthlikeness (\u00a72). Even\ngiven a solution to the logical problem, there remains a question\nabout our epistemic access to truthlikeness. The other is the\naxiological problem: what kind of cognitive values\nare truth and truthlikeness? The relations between truth,\ntruthlikeness, and cognitive value are explored in \u00a73.\n",
