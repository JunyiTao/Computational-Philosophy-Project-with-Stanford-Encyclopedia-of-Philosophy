    "main_text": "The Content of Religious Utterances || Ayer and Verificationism\n2.1 Ayer and Verificationism\n\nThe verificationist theory of meaning was popularised by A.J. Ayer in\nhis 1936 Language, Truth and Logic. Ayer argues that\nreligious statements\u2014his term for indicative\nsentences\u2014are \u201cliterally meaningless\u201d. According to\nAyer, a statement is factually contentful if and only if it is\nempirically verifiable. A statement is empirically verifiable if what\nit says can in principle be shown to be true or false by observation.\nAlthough logically necessary statements are not verifiable, according\nto Ayer they are analytic or true by virtue of the meaning of their\nconstituent terms. As such, \u201cnone of them provide any\ninformation about any matter of fact\u201d (1936: 79). Ayer\nencapsulated the verificationist theory of meaning with the infamous\nempirical verification principle: to have literal meaning a\nstatement must be either analytically true (and thereby factually\nuninformative) or empirically verifiable.\n\nAyer\u2019s chief target is metaphysics and he rather ambitiously\ntitled the first chapter of his book \u201cThe Elimination of\nMetaphysics\u201d. Metaphysics is taken to be made up of statements\nthat concern the nature of reality that falls beyond the scope of\nscientific inquiry. Examples include the existence of the external\nworld, the number of substances that there are in the world, whether\nthe world is made up of ideas and the reality of propositions or\nuniversals. Because theories on these issues are not empirically\nverifiable, Ayer takes them to lack \u201cfactual meaning\u201d:\nthey should be eliminated as a topic of debate. Other conspicuous\nvictims of the application of the verification principle were ethical,\naesthetic and religious statements all of which, so Ayer argues, are\nnot susceptible to verification and are thereby similarly factually\nmeaningless.\n Notably, however, Ayer has a positive \u201cemotivist\u201d\nstory to tell about ethical statements. Although he takes ethical\nstatements to be unverifiable descriptions of normative facts, from\nwhich he concludes that an ethical predicate \u201cadds nothing to\nthe literal meaning of the sentence\u201d, he argues that ethical\nlanguage has a non-descriptive function of expressing approval or\ndisapproval as well as encouraging attitudes of approval or\ndisapproval in others. For example, in saying \u201cStealing money is\nwrong\u201d, the speaker does not say something that is true or false\nbut expresses disapproval towards stealing (1936: 107). Ayer extends\nhis emotivism to aesthetic language: it is used \u201csimply to\nexpress certain feelings and evoke a certain response\u201d (1936:\n113). What of religious language? Ayer is silent on this issue,\nimplying that religious language should be dispensed with in the same\nway as other areas of metaphysics.\n\nLogical positivism was briefly in vogue in the 1930s but quickly ran\ninto intractable difficulties. That something is seriously awry can be\nseen by subjecting the verification principle to its own standards: it\nis itself neither empirically verifiable nor analytically\ntrue, so literally meaningless according to its own criterion. Ayer\nexacerbated this problem by exaggerating the predicament of statements\nthat failed to satisfy this principle, sometimes characterising them\nas \u201cnonsense\u201d. However, the central reason for the\ntheory\u2019s collapse was the failure to come up with a workable\nversion of the verification principle (see MacDonald 2010 for a\nreview). Ayer was unable to find a happy medium between a strict\nformulation that renders statements of scientific theory unverifiable\nand a lax formulation that allows any statement to be\nverifiable.\n This brings us to the question of why religious statements should\nbe held by to fall foul of the verification principle. Why can\u2019t\nreligious statements legitimately be regarded as scientific hypotheses\n(as Swinburne 1994, among others, argues)? Religious statements do in\nmany cases appear to have implications for what is or should be\nobservable. We can predict, for instance, that a world created by God\nwill exhibit various kinds of orderliness. It seems, therefore, that\nsome religious statements should be in a good a position to satisfy\nthe standards of literal content set up by the empirical verification\nprinciple. Ayer\u2019s reply to this argument is surprisingly terse.\nSuppose, he argues, that \u201cGod exists\u201d entails that there\nshould be observable regularities in nature. If that exhausted the\nobservable results of \u201cGod exists\u201d then \u201cto assert\nthe existence of a god will be simply equivalent to asserting that\nthere is the requisite regularity in nature\u201d (1936:\n115). Clearly, Ayer contends, this is not all that religious believers\nintend to assert in saying that God exists: they are committed to the\nexistence of an unverifiable supernatural agent.\n\nAyer\u2019s response seems to involve a sleight of hand. The\nverification principle is presented as a way of demarcating factually\ncontentful from contentless statements. In arguing against the\nverifiability of religious statements, Ayer relies on the assumption\nthat the verification principle provides the means for specifying what\nstatements mean. In this case, that the content of \u201cGod\nexists\u201d is exhausted by the observation statements that (in\ncombination with other assumptions) can be deduced from it. However,\nthis is in effect to concede that religious statements are\nverifiable according to the original (official) version of the\nverification principle. As to the meaning-specifying, unofficial\nversion of the verification principle, this is not something that Ayer\ndefends. However, it would place religious statements in good company\nwith scientific statements that posit theoretical entities that are\nnot directly observable and the meanings of which are similarly not\nexhausted by the observation statements that are derivable from\nthem.\n Despite the availability of conclusive objections to Ayer, worries\nabout the verifiability (or falsifiability) of religious statements\ncontinued to exert a remarkable influence on work in the philosophy of\nreligion, with papers and books being produced well into the second\nhalf of the twentieth century. Particularly notable is John\nHick\u2019s argument that theism could be verified postmortem:\n\u201cthe verifying situation lies in the final fulfilment of\nGod\u2019s purpose for us beyond this present life\u201d (1977b:\n190). Other examples include Flew and MacIntyre (1955), Ferr\u00e9\n(1962), Macquarrie (1967), Donovan (1976) and Tilley (1978); for a\ndiscussion of this prolonged impact see Scott (2013: 45\u201348).\n",
