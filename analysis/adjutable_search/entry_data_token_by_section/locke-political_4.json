    "main_text": "Locke and Punishment\n5. Locke and Punishment\n\nJohn Locke defined political power as \u201ca right of making laws\nwith penalties of death, and consequently all less Penalties\u201d\n(Two Treatises 2.3). Locke\u2019s theory of punishment is\nthus central to his view of politics and part of what he considered\ninnovative about his political philosophy. But he also referred to his\naccount of punishment as a \u201cvery strange doctrine\u201d (2.9),\npresumably because it ran against the assumption that only political\nsovereigns could punish. Locke believed that punishment requires that\nthere be a law, and since the state of nature has the law of nature to\ngovern it, it is permissible to describe one individual as\n\u201cpunishing\u201d another in that state. Locke\u2019s rationale\nis that since the fundamental law of nature is that mankind be\npreserved and since that law would \u201cbe in vain\u201d with no\nhuman power to enforce it (Two Treatises 2.7), it must,\ntherefore, be legitimate for individuals to punish each other even\nbefore government exists. In arguing this, Locke was disagreeing with\nSamuel Pufendorf (1934). Samuel Pufendorf had argued strongly that the\nconcept of punishment made no sense apart from an established positive\nlegal structure.\n\nLocke realized that the crucial objection to allowing people to act as\njudges with power to punish in the state of nature was that such\npeople would end up being judges in their own cases. Locke readily\nadmitted that this was a serious inconvenience and a primary reason\nfor leaving the state of nature (Two Treatises 2.13). Locke\ninsisted on this point because it helped explain the transition into\ncivil society. Locke thought that in the state of nature men had a\nliberty to engage in \u201cinnocent delights\u201d (actions that are\nnot a violation of any applicable laws), to seek their own\npreservation within the limits of natural law, and to punish\nviolations of natural law. The power to seek one\u2019s preservation\nis limited in civil society by the law, and the power to punish is\ntransferred to the government (Two Treatises\n2.128\u2013130). The power to punish in the state of nature is thus\nthe foundation for the right of governments to use coercive force.\n\nThe situation becomes more complex, however, if we look at the\nprinciples which are to guide punishment. Rationales for punishment\nare often divided into those that are forward-looking and\nbackward-looking. Forward-looking rationales include deterring crime,\nprotecting society from dangerous persons, and rehabilitation of\ncriminals. Backward-looking rationales normally focus on retribution,\ninflicting on the criminal harm comparable to the crime. Locke may\nseem to conflate these two rationales in passages like the\nfollowing:\n\nAnd thus in the state of nature, one Man comes by a power over\nanother, but yet no absolute or arbitrary Power, to use a criminal\nwhen he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats,\nor boundless extravagancy of his own will, but only to retribute to\nhim, so far as calm reason and conscience dictates, what is\nproportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for\nreparation and restraint. For these two are the only reasons, why one\nman may lawfully do harm to another, which is that [which] we call\npunishment. (Two Treatises 2.8)\n\n\nLocke talks both of retribution and of punishing only for reparation\nand restraint. Simmons argues that this is evidence that Locke is\ncombining both rationales for punishment in his theory. A survey of\nother seventeenth-century natural rights justifications for\npunishment, however, indicates that it was common to use words like\n\u201cretribute\u201d in theories that reject what we would today\ncall retributive punishment (Tuckness 2010a). In the passage quoted\nabove, Locke is saying that the proper amount of punishment is the\namount that will provide restitution to injured parties, protect the\npublic, and deter future crime. Locke\u2019s attitude toward\npunishment in his other writings on toleration, education, and\nreligion consistently follows this path toward justifying punishment\non grounds other than retribution. Tuckness claims that Locke\u2019s\nemphasis on restitution is interesting because restitution is backward\nlooking in a sense (it seeks to restore an earlier state of affairs)\nbut also forward looking in that it provides tangible benefits to\nthose who receive the restitution. There is a link here between\nLocke\u2019s understanding of natural punishment and his\nunderstanding of legitimate state punishment. Even in the state of\nnature, a primary justification for punishment is that it helps\nfurther the positive goal of preserving human life and human property.\nThe emphasis on deterrence, public safety, and restitution in\npunishments administered by the government mirrors this emphasis.\n\nA second puzzle regarding punishment is the permissibility of\npunishing internationally. Locke describes international relations as\na state of nature, and so in principle, states should have the same\npower to punish breaches of the natural law in the international\ncommunity that individuals have in the state of nature. This would\nlegitimize, for example, punishment of individuals for war crimes or\ncrimes against humanity even in cases where neither the laws of the\nparticular state nor international law authorize punishment. Thus in\nWorld War II, even if \u201ccrimes of aggression\u201d was not at\nthe time recognized as a crime for which individual punishment was\njustified, if the actions violated the natural law principle that one\nshould not deprive another of life, liberty, or property, the guilty\nparties could still be liable to criminal punishment. The most common\ninterpretation has thus been that the power to punish internationally\nis symmetrical with the power to punish in the state of nature.\n\nTuckness (2008a), however, has argued that there is an asymmetry\nbetween the two cases because Locke also talks about states being\nlimited in the goals that they can pursue. Locke often says that the\npower of the government is to be used for the protection of the rights\nof its own citizens, not for the rights of all people everywhere\n(Two Treatises 1.92, 2.88, 2.95, 2.131, 2.147). Locke argues\nthat in the state of nature a person is to use the power to punish to\npreserve his society, which is mankind as a whole. After states are\nformed, however, the power to punish is to be used for the benefit of\nhis own particular society. In the state of nature, a person is not\nrequired to risk his life for another (Two Treatises 2.6),\nand this presumably would also mean a person is not required to punish\nin the state of nature when attempting to punish would risk the life\nof the punisher. Locke may therefore be objecting to the idea that\nsoldiers can be compelled to risk their lives for altruistic reasons.\nIn the state of nature, a person could refuse to attempt to punish\nothers if doing so would risk his life and so Locke reasons that\nindividuals may not have consented to allow the state to risk their\nlives for altruistic punishment of international crimes.\n",
