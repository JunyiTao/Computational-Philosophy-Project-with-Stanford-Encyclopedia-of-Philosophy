Arguments in the Age of Materialism\n\nOne might have thought that if the mental and the physical are\nidentical, there could be no room for epiphenomenalistic questions to\narise. Behavior is caused by muscular events, and these are caused by\nneural events. Mental events will be identical with some of these\nneural events; so whatever effects these neural events have will be\neffects of mental events, and mental events will make a causal\ncontribution to, i.e., will \u201cmake a difference\u201d to our\nbehavior.\n\nQuestions about epiphenomenalism, however, arise the moment any\ndistinction is made between the mental properties and the physical\nproperties of an event. Section 3.1 will explain three ways in which\nthis can be done within a broadly materialist monism. The third of\nthese ways is still the subject of lively debate, and some of the\nissues will be explained in sections 3.2 and 3.3.\n\nIt should be noted that most recent writers take a somewhat dogmatic\nposition against epiphenomenalism. They presume that epiphenomenalism\nis to be avoided, and they go to great lengths to try to show that\nthey have avoided incurring that anathema, despite maintaining the\nsufficiency of physical causation in conjunction with some kind of\ndistinction between the mental and the physical.\n",
