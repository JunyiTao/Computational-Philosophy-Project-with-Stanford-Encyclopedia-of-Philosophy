    "main_text": "Touch and Action\n7. Touch and Action\nAs noted in the beginning, touch seems to have both a passive and\nan active nature. In its more passive forms, touch involves cutaneous\nactivations across the surface of the body. These include bodily\nsensations of hot and cold, pressure, vibration, and the like. In\naddition, these activations have a limited, entirely bodily spatial\ncharacter. This form of touch has played an important role in the\nearly empirical study of touch, especially in determining the nature\nand acuity of our sensory receptor populations. This has often been\naccomplished through the measure of the two\u2013point threshold\nmentioned above. This distance varies across the body and is a\nreliable guide to the density and spatial resolution of many tactual\nreceptors on the \n body.[4]\n While these passive forms of touch are\nimportant, especially in the empirical investigation of touch, in\ntypical, unconstrained touch, we use every part of our bodies to\nactively explore the environment. We use our hands and arms and\nfingers, we move our trunks and legs, and we actively feel with nearly\nevery surface of our body. Touch in ordinary use involves specialized\nmovements and grips. Such prehensile manipulation through touch is\noften distinguished from stereognosis, or object recognition through\ntouch. In addition, these movements recruit and make use of many\nreceptive systems that seem inherently active. For instance, haptic\ntouch involves feedback from our movements, along with information\nfrom our motor activities (both in motor planning and efference\ncopies). Perhaps most importantly, it also includes information from\nreceptors in our muscles and joints. All of these elements interact\nand play a critical role in forming and developing our sense of\ntouch. For this reason, touch, especially of the active, haptic\nvariety, seems like an ideal model for views of perception according\nto which perception is essentially a form of action, or at least a\nform of experience that involves action in a unique manner.\nGiven its active nature and dependence on exploratory movement,\nmany have taken touch to be best understood as an extended \u201c\nhaptic system\u201d that includes both surface receptors and motor\nareas (Gibson 1966). The wider haptic system so understood involves\nthe entire body and brings direct awareness of things in the\nenvironment by engaging and actively connecting together a number of\ndistinct sensory networks. Many later theorists have been influenced\nby this compelling account of touch.\nThe connections between touch and exploration run deep. To cite\njust one example, subjects have a remarkable ability to determine the\nsize and shape of many large objects simply by hefting and wielding\nthe objects through space (Turvey 1996). These actions provide a rich\nand distinctive form of awareness that cannot be generated or\nrecreated through skin activations alone. These dynamic touch\nexperiences reveal the strong connection between touch and action.\nMany theorists now think of perception as inherently active. This\nis a large, diverse group, one that includes motor theorists,\nenactivists, and many others (see the entry on\n embodied cognition).  Touch,\nespecially of the dynamic and interactive kind described by Gibson and\nTurvey, would seem to provide strong evidence in favor of such\nviews. Or at the least, if the case is to be made, one would expect it\nto be strongest for the sense of touch in its dynamic forms. To cite\nhere just one prominent example: No\u00eb (2004) defends an account of\nperception that takes it to be essentially a form of action. He begins\nhis discussion by arguing that vision is \u201ctouch like\u201d,\ninvolving sampling and exploratory probing of the environment. The\nactive nature of touch is never in question, and can be used in this\ncontext as a model for understanding other forms of perception. It is\ntrue that haptic touch seems inherently active, but many detailed\nquestions remain about the metaphysical relations between action and\ntouch (for instance, whether action is merely causally necessary or\nconstitutive of touch). This is likely to be an area of ongoing active\nresearch.\n",
