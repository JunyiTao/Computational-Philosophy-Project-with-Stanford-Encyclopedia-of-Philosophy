E. Johnson\u2019s Logic\n(1921):\n\n\nI propose to call such terms as color and shape\ndeterminables in relation to such terms as red and\ncircular which will be called determinates; and, in\nintroducing this new terminology, to examine the distinction between\nthe relation of red to color and the relation of\nPlato to man \u2026. (1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nJohnson\u2019s discussion is also the first systematic attempt to\ncharacterize the key features of determinables, determinates, and\ntheir relation (see esp. 1921: 173\u2013185), though as below, he is\nnot always clear about whether these features apply to properties or\nrather to predicates. See Prior (1949) and Poli (2004) for detailed\ndiscussion of Johnson\u2019s views and his influence on later\nauthors.\n\nSome of these features are familiar, including that determination is a\nspecification relation:\n\n\nTo predicate color or shape of an object obviously characterises it\nless determinately than to predicate of it red or circular; (Johnson\n1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nthat this specification is non-conjunctive:\n\n\nthere is a genuine difference between that process of increased\ndetermination which conjunctivally introduces foreign adjectives, and\nthat other process by which without increasing, so to speak, the\nnumber of adjectives, we define them more\n determinately;[2]\n (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 3)\n\n\nthat same-level determinates are incompatible:\n\n\nif any determinate adjective characterises a given substantive, then\nit is impossible that any other determinate under the same\ndeterminable should characterise the same substantive; (Johnson 1921:\nI, xi, 4)\n\n\nand that same-level determinates are moreover\n\u201copponent\u201d:\n\n\nthe unique and peculiar kind of difference that subsists between the\nseveral determinates under the same determinable [\u2026] does not\nsubsist between any one of them and an adjective under some other\ndeterminable. (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nJohnson moreover develops these features, suggesting, for example,\nthat opponent differences often reflect that determinates are\ncomparable:\n\n\nmany determinates under the same determinable [are such] that the\ndifferences between different pairs of determinates can be compared\nwith one another [\u2026]; e.g. the difference between red and\nyellow is greater than that between red and orange. (Johnson 1921: I,\nxi, 4)\n\n\nAttention to determinate comparability leads Johnson to suggest that\ndeterminables may be determined along multiple\n\u201cdimensions\u201d:\n\n\n[A] color may vary according to its hue, brightness and saturation; so\nthat the precise determination of a color requires us to define three\nvariables which are more or less independent of one another in their\ncapacity of co-variation; but in one important sense they are not\nindependent of one another, since they could not be manifested in\nseparation. The determinate color is therefore single, though complex\n\u2026. (1921: I, xi, 4)\n\n\nThat determinables may have multiple determination dimensions is an\nimportant observation, which plays a foundational role in\nFunkhouser\u2019s (2006) model of determination (see\n \u00a73.6.1).\n\nTwo other aspects of Johnson\u2019s discussion are worth noting.\nFirst, he denies that determinables are in any sense shared by\ndeterminates: \u201cthe ground for grouping determinates under one\nand the same determinable is not any partial agreement between\nthem\u201d but rather \u201cthe special kind of difference\u201d\n(1921: I, xi, 1) distinguishing opposing\n determinates.[3]\n As we\u2019ll see, this is a choice point for contemporary accounts.\nSecond, Johnson assumes that while limits in our perceptual or\ninstrumental capabilities require that we characterize objects in\ndeterminable terms, it is nonetheless a\n\n\nuniversally adopted postulate that the characters of things which we\ncan only characterise more or less indeterminately, are, in actual\nfact, absolutely determinate. (1921: I, xi, 5)\n\n\nThe assumption that determinable characterization reflects (mere)\nepistemic, perceptual, or representational limits remains common, and\npushes towards giving one or other deflationary account of\ndeterminables. This is another choice point: on some contemporary\naccounts determinables are both real and irreducible to\ndeterminates.\n",
