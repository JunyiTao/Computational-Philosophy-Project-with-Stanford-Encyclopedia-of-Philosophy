    "main_text": "Returning to the Everyday Lifeworld: Not One || Zen Person\n8.1 Zen Person\n\nFor the Zen person, the move from \u201cnot two\u201d to \u201cnot\none\u201d is an issue of concretely instantiating in the everyday\nlifeworld what is experienced through the stance of\n\u201cnot two.\u201d This point, for example, is well illustrated in\nthe following Zen dialogue between Zen Master Ungen (Chin.\nY\u00fany\u00e1n, 780\u2013841) and a fellow practitioner,\nD\u014dgo (Chin., D\u00e0ow\u00fa; 769\u2013835). When Ungen is making\na cup of tea, the dialogue runs as \nfollows:\n\n\nD\u014dgo: To whom are you going to serve the tea you are preparing? \n\nUngen: There is the person who wants it.\n\nD\u014dgo: Can\u2019t the person who wants it make the tea\nhimself?\n\nUngen: Fortunately, I am here to do it for him. \n(Ueda, 1981, 165\u201366.)\n\n\nThis dialogue points to an activity of \u201ctrans-individual\nqua the individual,\u201d where the\n\u201ctrans-individual\u201d designates a Zen person with\nnondiscriminatory wisdom, while the \u201cindividual\u201d\ndesignates those who remain in the everyday lifeworld.\n(In the above quote, the former is designated by the phrase \u201cthe\nperson,\u201d while the latter by the pronoun \u201cyou.\u201d)\nHowever, in the everyday human lifeworld, the\n\u201ctrans-individual\u201d cannot \u201cmake the tea\nhimself,\u201d because he is not incarnate like the individual who\nremains in the dualistic, either-or ego-logical, everyday standpoint.\nThis is because he or she is one who follows the non-dualistic,\nnon-ego-logical standpoint having practically transcended the former.\nThis creates the dilemma of how to be trans-individual while assuming\nthe form of an individual. If this is not properly dealt with, Zen\nwarns that it results in developing a pathological condition or a\nmana-personality. For this reason, Ungen says\n\u201cfortunately \u2018I\u2019 am here to do it for him.\u201d\nHere, Zen conceives of the relationship between the individual and the\ntrans-individual as one, i.e., \u201cnot two,\u201d and yet they are\n\u201cnot one.\u201d Insofar as both the trans-individual and the\nindividual refer to the same person (in the above quote,\n\u201cI\u201d), they are \u201cnot two,\u201d but insofar as their\nstances operate differently, they are \u201cnot one\u201d\n(\u201cI\u201d and \u201chim\u201d in the quote). \u201cBoth\nindividual and trans-individual\u201d designates a harmonious\nassimilation of the two stances, a consequence of which is a person\nwho can avail him or herself of both of these perspectives, i.e., the\ndualistic world of the everyday life and the non-dualistic world of\n\u201cnot two.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cneither individual\nnor trans-individual\u201d refers to a person who cannot be pinned\ndown or delimited by linguistic means. In spite of, or because of\nthis, such a person is a carrier of freedom who goes beyond these\nperspectives, i.e., a person in whom the trans-individual and\nindividual have disappeared in action, in which case the\nindividual qua trans-individual is no longer\nordinary, but extraordinary. Yet, he or she is quite ordinary\nin appearance. All of these points are synthesized into a Zen\nperson. \n",
