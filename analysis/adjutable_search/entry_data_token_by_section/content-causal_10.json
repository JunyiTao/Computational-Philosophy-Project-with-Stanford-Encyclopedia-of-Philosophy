So, for\nexample, people can think about unicorns, fountains of youth, or the\nplanet Vulcan. Cases such as these are discussed in Stampe (1977) and\nFodor (1990a), among other places. These things would be physical\nobjects were they to exist, but they do not, so one cannot causally\ninteract with them. In principle, one could say that thoughts about\nsuch things are not counterexamples to causal theories, since causal\ntheories are meant only to offer sufficiency conditions for meaning.\nBut, this in principle reply appears to be ad hoc. It is not\nwarranted, for example, by the fact that these excluded meanings\ninvolve abstract objects. There are, however, a number of options that\nmight be explored here.\n\nOne strategy would be to turn to the basic ontology of one\u2019s\ncausal theory of mental content. This is where a theory based on\nnomological relations might be superior to a version that is based on\ncausal relations between individuals. One might say that there can be\na unicorn-\u201cunicorn\u201d law, even if there are no actual\nunicorns. This story, however, would break down for mental\nrepresentations of individuals, such as the putative planet Vulcan.\nThere is no law that connects a mental representation to an\nindividual; laws are relations among properties.\n\nAnother strategy would be to propose that some thought symbols are\ncomplex and can decompose into meaningful primitive constituents. One\ncould then allow that \u201cX\u201d is a kind of abbreviation for,\nor logical construction of, or defined in terms of \u201cY1,\u201d\n\u201cY2,\u201d and \u201cY3,\u201d and that a causal theory\napplies to \u201cY1,\u201d \u201cY2,\u201d and \u201cY3.\u201d\nSo, for example, one might have a thought of a unicorn, but rather\nthan having a single unicorn mental representation there is another\nrepresentation made up of a representation of a horse, a\nrepresentation of a horn, and a representation of the relationship\nbetween the horse and the horn. \u201cHorse\u201d,\n\u201chorn\u201d, and \u201cpossession,\u201d may then have\ninstantiated properties as their contents.\n",
