That\ntradition extends to the policy analysis branch of economic analysis\nof law. In the prior section, we considered the manifestation of this\ntradition in the advocacy of cost-benefit analysis as a normative\ntheory of adjudication. In this section, we consider arguments for\nwelfarism as the sole evaluative standard against which to appraise\nlegal rules and institutions. \n\nThe critique of cost-benefit analysis described in section 5.2.1 was\ndirected against cost-benefit analysis, a specific and concrete form\nof welfarism developed to implement the more abstract evaluative ideas\nunderlying welfarism. Objections to this specific instantiation of\nwelfarism do not necessarily run against the more general class of\nevaluative criteria. Similarly, the critique described in section\n5.2.2 focused on the institutional structure of adjudication; though\nthis structure may be hostile to an implementation of a welfarist\ntheory of adjudication, it has no bearing on the appropriate criteria\nagainst which a third party should assess legal rules and\ninstitutions. \n\nThe discussion in this section reviews the debate over whether the\nevaluation of legal rules and institutions should rely only\non welfarist criteria. As noted earlier, Kaplow and Shavell [2001]\noffered an extensive argument for welfarism as the sole criterion.\nTheir argument has several\n elements.[29]\n The first element identifies an individual\u2019s well-being with\nher preferences. Thus, an individual K has greater well-being\nin state X than in state Y, if and only if she\nprefers state X to state Y. In the second, key\nelement of the argument, welfarism interprets the agent\u2019s\npreferences as her all-things-considered ranking of alternatives. This\nstep thus incorporates within the agent\u2019s preference ordering\nanything that the agent considers relevant to her decisions.\nConsequently, the claim about an agent\u2019s well-being now becomes:\nK prefers state X to state Y if and only if\nK believes, all things considered, that state X is\nbetter than (or ought to be promoted rather than) state B.\n\n\nK\u2019s all-things-considered judgments, of course, will\nincluded many considerations that, in ordinary language, are not\nusually considered as in K\u2019s self-interest or even as\ncontributing to her well-being. So, for example, her\nall-things-considered judgments will incorporate concerns for the\nwell-being of others as well as considerations of justice and\ndeontological constraints on action. Section 6.1 discusses the\ncounterargument that an individual\u2019s concerns for justice and\nher endorsement of deontological constraints cannot be integrated into\nan adequate concept of well-being.\n\nKaplow and Shavell\u2019s argument for the exclusivity of welfarism\nas an evaluative criterion rests on a third leg. The argument contends\nthat use of any non-welfarist criterion is incompatible with the\nPareto criterion. Section 6.2 accepts this claim for purposes of\nargument. The discussion then points out that the Pareto criterion\nconflicts with principles of rationality, valuation, liberty, and\nresponsibility that have an equally strong\n appeal.[30]\n It is thus not clear that we should accept the Pareto criterion and\nreject these others principles.\n",
