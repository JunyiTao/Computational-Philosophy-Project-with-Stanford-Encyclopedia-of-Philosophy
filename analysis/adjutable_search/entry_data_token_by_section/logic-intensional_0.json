What is this about?\n\n\nIf you are not skilled in colloquial astronomy, and I tell you that\nthe morning star is the evening star, I have given you\ninformation\u2014your knowledge has changed. If I tell you the\nmorning star is the morning star, you might feel I was wasting your\ntime. Yet in both cases I have told you the planet Venus was\nself-identical. There must be more to it than this. Naively, we might\nsay the morning star and the evening star are the same in one way, and\nnot the same in another. The two phrases, \u201cmorning star\u201d\nand \u201cevening star\u201d may designate the same object, but they\ndo not have the same meaning. Meanings, in this sense, are often\ncalled intensions, and things designated,\nextensions. Contexts in which extension is all that matters\nare, naturally, called extensional, while contexts in which\nextension is not enough are intensional. Mathematics is\ntypically extensional throughout\u2014we happily write\n\u201c\\(1+4=2+3\\)\u201d even though the two terms involved may\ndiffer in meaning (more about this later). \u201cIt is known\nthat\u2026\u201d is a typical intensional context\u2014\u201cit\nis known that \\(1+4 = 2 + 3\\)\u201d may not be correct when the\nknowledge of small children is involved. Thus mathematical pedagogy\ndiffers from mathematics proper. Other examples of intensional\ncontexts are \u201cit is believed that\u2026\u201d, \u201cit is\nnecessary that\u2026\u201d, \u201cit is informative\nthat\u2026\u201d, \u201cit is said that\u2026\u201d, \u201cit\nis astonishing that\u2026\u201d, and so on. Typically a context\nthat is intensional can be recognized by a failure of the\nsubstitutivity of equality when naively applied. Thus, the morning\nstar equals the evening star; you know the morning star equals the\nmorning star; then on substituting equals for equals, you know the\nmorning star equals the evening star. Note that this knowledge arises\nfrom purely logical reasoning, and does not involve any investigation\nof the sky, which should arouse some suspicion. Substitution of\nco-referring terms in a knowledge context is the problematic\nmove\u2014such a context is intensional, after all. Admittedly this\nis somewhat circular. We should not make use of equality of extensions\nin an intensional context, and an intensional context is one in which\nsuch substitutivity does not work.\n\n\nThe examples used above involve complex terms, disguised definite\ndescriptions. But the same issues come up elsewhere as well, often in\nways that are harder to deal with formally. Proper names constitute\none well-known area of difficulties. The name \u201cCicero\u201d\nand the name \u201cTully\u201d denote the same person, so\n\u201cCicero is Tully\u201d is true. Proper names are generally\nconsidered to be rigid, once a designation has been specified it does\nnot change. This, in effect, makes \u201cCicero is Tully\u201d into\na necessary truth. How, then, could someone not know it?\n\u201cSuperman is Clark Kent\u201d is even more difficult to deal\nwith, since there is no actual person the names refer to. Thus while\nthe sentence is true, not only might one not know it, but one might\nperfectly well believe Clark Kent exists, that is \u201cClark\nKent\u201d designates something, while not believing Superman exists.\nExistence issues are intertwined, in complex ways, with intensional\nmatters. Further, the problems just sketched at the ground level\ncontinue up the type hierarchy. The property of being an equilateral\ntriangle is coextensive with the property of being an equiangular\ntriangle, though clearly meanings differ. Then one might say,\n\u201cit is trivial that an equilateral triangle is an equilateral\ntriangle,\u201d yet one might deny that \u201cit is trivial that an\nequilateral triangle is an equiangular triangle\u201d.\n\n\nIn classical first-order logic intension plays no role. It is\nextensional by design since primarily it evolved to model the\nreasoning needed in mathematics. Formalizing aspects of natural\nlanguage or everyday reasoning needs something richer. Formal systems\nin which intensional features can be represented are generally\nreferred to as intensional logics. This article discusses\nsomething of the history and evolution of intensional logics. The aim\nis to find logics that can formally represent the issues sketched\nabove. This is not simple and probably no proposed logic has been\nentirely successful. A relatively simple intensional logic that can\nbe used to illustrate several major points will be discussed in some\ndetail, difficulties will be pointed out, and pointers to other, more\ncomplex, approaches will be given.\n",
