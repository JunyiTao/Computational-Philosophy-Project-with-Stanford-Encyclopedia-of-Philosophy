    "main_text": "Modes of Evolution\n3. Other Topics in the Philosophy of Evolution\n\nSome of the work in the philosophy of evolution deals with\ncontroversial issues. There is, of course, the debate over\n creationism.\n The vast majority of philosophers agree that creationism has significantly less evidence in its favor as compared to the abundant evidence in favor of evolution.  They also agree that\ncreationism ought not to be taught in a public school science classroom,\nbut they sometimes disagree over the reasons why. For example, is\nit because it fails some criteria of science? If so, which criteria?\nOr is it because of the lack of evidence? Or is it because of its\nreligious basis? Debates over\n sociobiology\n and\n evolutionary psychology\u2014areas\n that seek to explain human behavior and psychology as evolved\ncharacteristics\u2014have likewise stirred up controversy over their\nscientific status. Proponents have also been accused of employing an\nexcessive and uncritical adaptationism and resting on sexist or other\nproblematic biases (on the latter, see the entry on\n feminist philosophy of biology).\n\nAnother nexus of topics in the philosophy of evolution involves\n heredity and heritability.\n Although it was not explicitly emphasized in the definitions of\nevolution given above, evolution is usually taken to be about\nheritable changes over time, i.e., characteristics that are\nable to be passed from one generation to the next. But there has been\nsome discussion over which entities can properly be said to be\nheritable. Genes are uncontroversial, but are seen as too limited by\nsome, who would consider phenomena such as learning and cultural\ntransmission, epigenetic inheritance, and ecological inheritance to be\nheritable as well. The term \u201cheritability\u201d can likewise\ncause confusion, as it is a technical term within evolutionary theory,\nand understanding the term and its implications is not trivial.\nClassically, heredity has been thought of in terms of the\n genotype/phenotype distinction,\n with genotypes being seen as heritable and phenotypes being seen as\nnot heritable. But to accept that distinction seems to accept a\ndistinction between\n innate and acquired characteristics,\n and that distinction has been challenged, or at least shown to be\nmore complicated than it would seem at first glance. Heredity also\nraises questions about\n biological information\u2014do\n genotypes pass along information, and if so, in what\nsense?\n\nRelatedly, for heredity to be a part of evolution, there must be\n replication\n of entities, or at least reproduction (with the former being a\nspecial case of the latter that involves copying). In order to allow\nfor a more general theory of evolution, many authors will speak of\nreplicators (or reproducers) and vehicles (or interactors) rather than\nthe more limited and specific terms \u201cgenes\u201d and\n\u201corganisms\u201d. With these terms in hand, one can more easily\nbegin to discuss (as many have) questions over\n units and levels of selection:\n does selection occur at the level of the gene, the organism, the\ngroup, the species, or all of the above? These units of selection\n(replicators/reproducers or vehicles/interactors) are often taken to\nbe biological individuals (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual)\n as a necessary condition for being units of selection at all. \n\nInterestingly, another major area in which biological individuality\nhas played a large role is in debates over the nature of  species.\n That is, many philosophers of biology maintain that species are\nproperly construed as individuals. Species, often referred to as\n\u201cunits of evolution\u201d\u2014groups of organisms that evolve\nin a unified way\u2014are nonetheless rarely seen as units of\nselection. In Elisabeth Lloyd\u2019s terminology (see the\nentry on\n units and levels of selection),\n this is presumably because species are rarely seen as\nreplicators/reproducers or vehicles/interactors but are commonly seen\nas beneficiaries of evolution by natural selection. In addition to\nsorting out whether species are individuals and what sort of units of\nevolution (if any) they might be, there are many-decades\u2019 worth\nof papers trying to characterize the species concept, whether in terms\nof interbreeding, phylogeny, morphology, ecology, or some other set of\ncharacteristics. Here, as in many other areas of the philosophy of\nbiology, there have also been arguments for a pluralistic\napproach.\n\nYet another area of discussion is\n evolutionary game theory\u2014an\n application of the mathematical theory of games to biological and\nother evolutionary contexts. It has provided a source of putative\nexplanations for human and other behaviors; evolutionary psychology,\nmentioned above, is one area that frequently makes use of a game\ntheory approach. Among the more challenging behaviors that\nevolutionary game theory has sought to explain is\n altruism.\n With altruism, we again encounter questions about the level at which\nselection is operating (organisms or groups) because of questions\nabout which entities selection is benefiting or harming. \n",
