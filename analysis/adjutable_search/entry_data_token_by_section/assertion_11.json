The speaker may intend\nthe hearer to come to believe something or other about the speaker, or\nabout something else, or intend the hearer to come to desire or intend\nto do something. Such intentions can concern institutional changes,\nbut need not. Intentions that are immediately concerned with\ncommunication itself, as opposed to ulterior goals, are called\ncommunicative intentions.\n\nThe idea of communicative intentions derives from Grice\u2019s (1957)\narticle \u2018Meaning\u2019, where Grice defined what it is for a\nspeaker to non-naturally mean something. Although Grice did\nnot explicitly attempt to define assertion, his ideas can be\nstraightforwardly transposed to provide a definition:\n\n(Gr-A)\nS asserts that p by the utterance u iff\nthere is a hearer H such that\n\n\ni.\nS intends u to produce in H the belief\nthat p\nii.\nS intends H to recognize that i\niii.\nS intends H to believe that p at least\npartly for the reason that i\n \n\n\nIn the early to mid 1960s Austin\u2019s speech act theory and\nGrice\u2019s account of communicative intentions began to merge. The\nconnection is discussed in Strawson 1964. Strawson inquired whether\nillocutionary force could be made overt by means of communicative\nintentions. He concluded that when it comes to highly conventionalized\nutterances, communicative intentions are largely irrelevant, but that\non the other hand, convention does not play much role for ordinary\nillocutionary types. Strawson also pointed out a difficulty with\nGrice\u2019s analysis: it may be the case that all three conditions\n(i-iii) are fulfilled, but that the speaker intends the hearer to\nbelieve that they aren\u2019t (for instance, if the speaker\nwants the hearer to believe that p for reasons altogether\nindependent from his making the statement).\n\nSuch intentions to mislead came to be called sneaky\nintentions (Grice 1969), and they constituted a problem for\nspeech act analyses based on communicative intentions. The idea was\nthat genuine communication is essentially open: the speaker\u2019s\ncommunicative intentions are meant to be fully accessible to the\nhearer. Sneaky intentions violate this requirement of openness, and\ntherefore apparently they must be ruled out one way or another.\nStrawson\u2019s own solution was to add a fourth clause about the\nspeaker\u2019s intention that the hearer recognize the third\nintention. However, that solution only invited a sneaky intention one\nlevel up (cf. Schiffer 1972: 17\u201342; Vlach 1981; Davis 1999).\n\nAnother solution was to make the intention reflexive. This\nwas proposed by Searle (1969), in the first full-blown analysis of\nillocutionary types made by appeal to communicative intentions. Searle\ncombined this with an appeal to social institutions as created by\nrules. We return to these in\n section 5.1.\n\nSearle criticized Grice for requiring the speaker to intend\nperlocutionary effects, such as what the speaker shall come\nto do or believe, pointing out that such intentions aren\u2019t\nessential (1969: 46\u20137). Instead, according to Searle, the\nspeaker intends to be understood, and also intends to achieve\nthis by means of the hearer\u2019s recognition of this very intention\nitself. Moreover, if the intention is recognized, it is also\nfulfilled: \u201cwe achieve what we try to do by getting our audience\nto recognize what we try to do\u201d (Searle 1969: 47). This\nreflexive intention is formally spelled out as follows:\n\n(Srl-I)\nS utters sentence T and means it (i.e., means\nliterally what he says) = S utters T and\n\n\na.\nS intends (i-1) the utterance U of T to\nproduce in H the knowledge (recognition, awareness) that the\nstates of affairs specified by (certain of) the rules of T\nobtain. (Call this the illocutionary effect, IE)\nb.\nS intends U to produce IE by means of the\nrecognition of i-1\nc.\nS intends that i-1 will be recognized in virtue of (by\nmeans of) H\u2019s knowledge of (certain of) the rules governing (the\nelements of) T (Searle 1969: 49\u201350).\n \n\n\nThe illocutionary effect IE is the effect of generating the state\nspecified in the constitutive rule. In the case of assertion, the\nspeaker intends that her utterance counts as an undertaking\nthat p represents an actual state of affairs, depending on\nthe constitutive rule (cf.\n section 5.1).\n\nBach and Harnish follow Searle in appealing to reflexive communicative\nintentions. On their analysis (1979: 42), assuming a speaker\nS and a hearer H,\n\n(BH-A)\nS asserts that p iff S expresses\n\n\ni.\nthe belief that p, and\nii.\nthe intention that H believe that p.\n \n\n\nAccording to Bach and Harnish\u2019s understanding, a speaker\nS expresses an attitude just in case S\nR-intends (reflexively intends) the hearer to take\nS\u2019s utterance as reason to think S has that\nattitude. They understand the reflexive nature of the intention pretty\nmuch like Searle. They say (1979: 15) that the intended effect of an\nact of communication is not just any effect produced by means of\nrecognition of the intention to produce a certain effect, it is\nthe recognition of that intention.\n\nThese appeals to reflexive intentions were later criticized, in\nparticular by Sperber and Wilson (1986 [1995:256\u2013257]). Their\npoint is that if an intention I has as sub-intentions both\nthe intention J and the intention that the hearer recognize\nI, this will yield an infinitely long sequence: the intention\nthat: J and the hearer recognize the intention that:\nJ and the hearer recognize the intention that: J and\n\u2026). If this is an intention content at all, it is not humanly\n graspable.[17]\n\nApart from the communicative intentions accounts of assertion, there\nare more general questions about what intentions are required of a\nspeaker in order for his utterance to qualify as an assertion. For\ninstance, must he intend it to be an assertion? Must it be\nmade voluntarily?\n",
