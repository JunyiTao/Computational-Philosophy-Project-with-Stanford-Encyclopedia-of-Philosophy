    "main_text": "\n\nQuantum theory provides a framework for modern theoretical physics\nthat enjoys enormous predictive and explanatory success. Yet, in view\nof the so-called \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, there is no\nconsensus on how physical reality can possibly be such that this\nframework has this success. The theory is thus an extremely\nwell-functioning algorithm to predict and explain the results of\nobservations, but no consensus on which kind of objective reality\nmight plausibly underlie these observations.\n\nAmongst the many attempts to provide an \u201cinterpretation\u201d\nof quantum theory to account for this predictive and explanatory\nsuccess, one class of interpretations hypothesizes backward-in-time\ncausal influences\u2014retrocausality\u2014as the basis for\nconstructing a convincing foundational account of quantum theory. This\nentry presents an overview of retrocausal approaches to the\ninterpretation of quantum theory, the main motivations for adopting\nthis approach, a selection of concrete suggested retrocausal models,\nand a review of the objections brought forward against such\napproaches.\n",
