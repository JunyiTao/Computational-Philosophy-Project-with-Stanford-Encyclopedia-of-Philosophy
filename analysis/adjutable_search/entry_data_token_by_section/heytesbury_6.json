    "main_text": "Speculative Physics || Beginning and Ceasing\n3.1 Beginning and Ceasing\n\nIn chapter IV of the Regulae (De incipit et desinit)\nHeytesbury poses and analyzes in great detail cases in which any\nprocess, thing, or state may be said to begin or cease to be. He\nbegins with possible expositions of the terms \u201cbeginning\u201d\n(incipere) and \u201cceasing\u201d (desinere) in a\nway that uncovers certain paradoxical properties of the temporal\ncontinuum. \u201cBeginning\u201d may be expounded by\npositio of the present (i.e., by the positing of existence in\nthe present instant) and remotio of the past (i.e., by denial\nof existence in the past), meaning that in the present instant a thing\nor a process is, and immediately prior to the present instant it was\nnot. \u201cBeginning\u201d may be also expounded by remotio\nof the present and positio of the future, meaning that in the\npresent instant a thing or a process is not, and immediately after the\npresent instant it will be. Likewise, \u201cceasing\u201d may be\nexpounded in two ways, either by remotio of the present and\npositio of the past, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is not, and immediately prior to the present\ninstant it was, or by positio of the present and\nremotio of the future, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is, and immediately after the present instant it\nwill not be. Heytesbury offers a number of sophisms involving the\nlimit-decision. One of them is particularly interesting since it\nclearly exhibits Heytesbury\u2019s remarkable skill in solving\nproblems of instantaneous motion and time without the symbolic\ntechniques of calculus. Heytesbury poses a case in which both Plato\nand Socrates begin to move from rest at the same instant, but Plato\nstarts to move with a constant acceleration and Socrates with an\nacceleration which starts at zero degree and increases uniformly with\ntime. He concludes that \u201cboth Socrates and Plato infinitely\nslowly begin to be moved, and yet Socrates infinitely more slowly\nbegins to be moved than Plato\u201d (Wilson 1960: 54, [RSS] 1494:\nfol. 26vb). As Wilson proves, the conclusion is an effect of\ncomparison of two infinitesimals of different order.\n\n\nIn the case under consideration both the velocity of Plato (\\(v_p\\))\nand the velocity of Socrates (\\(v_s\\)) are infinitesimal for time\nt approaching zero. Two infinitesimals are said to be of\ndifferent order if the limit of their quotient is either zero or\ninfinite. In the case under consideration the limit of the quotient\n\\(v_p/v_s\\) as \\(t\\rightarrow 0\\) is infinite. (Wilson 1960: 55)\n\n",
