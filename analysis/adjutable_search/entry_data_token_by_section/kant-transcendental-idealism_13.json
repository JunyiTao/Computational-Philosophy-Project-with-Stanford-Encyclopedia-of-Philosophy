The \u201cDual Aspect\u201d View\n\nBecause the phenomenalist interpretation of transcendental idealism\nheld such sway, not only among Kant\u2019s contemporaries, but for\ngenerations of German philosophers as well, these problems for the\nphenomenalist construal of transcendental idealism were taken to be\nevidence that Kant\u2019s view itself is\n inconsistent.[36]\n In the twentieth century, the phenomenalist (or\n\u201cBerkeleyan\u201d) interpretation of transcendental idealism is\nassociated with P.F. Strawson, whose massively influential (1966)\nargued that, for many of the reasons we have seen, transcendental\nidealism was a blunder on Kant\u2019s part (Strawson 1966: 16,\n38\u201342, 253\u201373). However, Strawson claimed, the core\narguments of the Critique do not in fact rely on it and can\nbe reconstructed independently of it.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a group of scholars, in some cases in direct\nopposition to Strawson, developed a non-phenomenalist,\nanti-metaphysical reading of transcendental idealism, the \u201cdual\naspect\u201d\n view.[37]\n These scholars took the textbook problems for phenomenalism\n(especially, the problem of affection) as evidence that this was the\nwrong interpretation of Kant\u2019s position to begin with. They\nsought to rescue transcendental idealism from what they took to be the\nphenomenalist misconstrual, defend its philosophical cogency from its\ndetractors, and show, contra Strawson, that the central arguments of\nthe Critique do rely on transcendental idealism. This was as\nmuch a philosophical defense of Kantian transcendental idealism as it\nwas an interpretive-exegetical project.\n\nThey developed what has become known as the \u201cdual aspect\u201d\nview. They argue that many of the classic problems for the\nphenomenalist reading (e.g., affection) arise because it was\nmistakenly assumed that appearances and things in themselves are\ndistinct kinds of objects. They argued instead that the\nappearance/thing in itself distinction is not an ontological\ndistinction between two kinds of objects, but an adverbial distinction\nbetween two different perspectives or stances we can take on one and\nthe same set of objects: we can consider them as they appear, or as\nthey are \u201cin themselves\u201d.\n",
