    "main_text": "The Causal Markov Condition\n7. The Causal Markov Condition\n\nReichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle is closely related to the\nCausal Markov Condition that is commonly employed in causal\nmodeling. A version of the Causal Markov Condition was first\nproposed by Kiiveri, Speed, and Carlin (1984). Detailed programs in\ncausal modeling featuring the Causal Markov Condition have been\ndeveloped by Pearl (2009) and Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines\n(2000).\n\nWe will describe here just one kind of causal model, the causal\nBayes net. A causal Bayes net uses a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG) to represent causal relations among a set of\nvariables, and pairs it with a probability distribution over the set\nof variables. More precisely, a causal Bayes net is a triple\n\\((\\mathbf{V}, \\mathcal{G}, p)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is a set of\nvariables, \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a directed acyclic graph over\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\), and p is a probability distribution over the\nfield of events generated by \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). The variables in\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) correspond to the properties of individuals in some\npopulation. For example, in a population of American adults, we might\nhave variables representing an individual\u2019s education level,\nwork experience, and present income. A variable can be binary,\nrepresenting the presence or absence of some property, but it can also\nbe multiple-valued or continuous.\n\n\\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a set of ordered pairs of variables in\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\). If \\((X, Y) \\in \\mathcal{G}\\), we represent this\ngraphically by drawing an arrow from X to Y, and we say\nthat X is a parent of Y. If there are arrows\nfrom \\(X_{1}\\) to \\(X_{2}\\), \\(X_{2}\\) to \\(X_{3}\\),\u2026 and\n\\(X_{n-1}\\) to \\(X_{n}\\), then there is a directed path from\n\\(X_{1}\\) to \\(X_{n}\\). In this case, we say that \\(X_{n}\\) is a\ndescendant of \\(X_{1}\\). \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is acyclic if there\nis no directed path from any variable to itself.\n Figure 9\n shows a DAG on the variable set \\(\\{U, V, W, X, Y, Z\\}\\). In this\nDAG, there is a directed path from U to Z, and Z\nis a descendant of U. \\(\\PA(X)\\) is the set of all parents of\nX and \\(\\ND(X)\\) is the set of all variables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\)\nother than X and its descendants. In\n Figure 9,\n \\(\\PA(W) = \\{U, V\\}\\) and \\(\\ND(W) = \\{U, V, X\\}\\).\n\nA DAG represents the qualitative causal structure among the set of\nvariables in an individual from the relevant population. In\nparticular, an arrow from X to Y indicates that X\nhas a causal influence on Y that is not mediated by any other\nvariables in the set. In this case, we say that X is a direct\ncause of Y.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: A DAG on the variable set\n\\(\\{U, V, W, X, Y, Z\\}\\). \\(\\PA(W) = \\{U, V\\}\\) is the set of parents\nof W and \\(\\ND(W) = \\{U, V, X\\}\\) is the set of non-descendants\nof W. [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nThe Causal Markov Condition connects the graph \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) with\nthe probability distribution p over the algebra generated by\nthe variables. It says that p must exhibit specific relations\nof conditional probabilistic independence that are implied by the\ngraph. In the special case where \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a DAG, the\nfollowing three formulations of the Causal Markov Condition are\nequivalent:\n\n\n\nCausal Markov Condition: Screening off version.\n\nFor every variable X in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), and every set of\nvariables \\(\\mathbf{Y} \\subseteq \\ND(X):\\) \n\n\\[p(X | \\PA(X) \\cap \\mathbf{Y}) = p(X | \\PA(X))\\]\n\n\nWe employ a notational convention where statements involving variables\nare understood to involve universal quantification over values of\nthose variables (or over measurable sets of values). This version of\nthe Causal Markov Condition says that the parents of variable X\nscreen X off from all other variables, except for X\nitself and the descendants of X. Given the values of the\nvariables that are parents of X, the values of the variables in\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) make no further difference to the probability that\nX will take on any given value. This version of the Causal\nMarkov Condition is closest in form to Reichenbach\u2019s Common\nCause Principle, although it is formulated in terms of the parents of\nX, rather than the common cause(s) of X and\nY.\n\n\nCausal Markov Condition: Factorization version.\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{V} = \\{X_{1}, X_{2}, \\dots, X_{n}\\}\\). Then:\n\n\\[p(X_{1} \\cap X_{2} \\cap \\dots \\cap X_{n}) = \\prod_{i} p(X_{i}|\\PA(X_{i})).\\]\n\n\nThis version tells us that once we know the conditional probability\ndistribution of each variable given its parents,\n\\(p(X_{i}|\\PA(X_{i}))\\), we can compute the complete joint\ndistribution over all of the variables. This captures\nReichenbach\u2019s idea that probabilistic correlations between\nevents can ultimately be derived from probabilistic correlations\nresulting from cause and effect relationships.\n\n\nCausal Markov Condition: d-separation\nversion.\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y},\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) be disjoint subsets\nof \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Then: \n\n\\[p(\\mathbf{X} \\cap \\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{Z}) = p(\\mathbf{X}|\\mathbf{Z}) \\times p(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{Z})\\] \n\n\nif \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) d-separates \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{G}.\\)\n\nThis version introduces the graphical notion of d-separation.\nA path from X to Y is a sequence of variables \\((X =\nX_{1},\\dots, X_{k} = Y)\\) such that for each \\(X_{i}\\), \\(X_{i+1},\\) there\nis either an arrow from \\(X_{i}\\) to \\(X_{i+1}\\) or an arrow from\n\\(X_{i+1}\\) to \\(X_{i}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). For example, in\n Figure 9,\n \\(\\{U, Y, W, V, X\\}\\) forms a path. A variable \\(X_{i}\\), \\(1 < i <\nk\\) is a collider on the path just in case there is an arrow\nfrom \\(X_{i-1}\\) to \\(X_{i}\\) and from \\(X_{i+1}\\) to \\(X_{i}\\). In\nother words, \\(X_{i}\\) is a collider just in case the arrows converge\non \\(X_{i}\\) in the path: \n\n\\[X_{i-1} \\rightarrow X_i \\leftarrow X_{i+1}.\\]\n\nin\n Figure 9,\n Y is a collider on the path \\(\\{U, Y, W, V, X\\}.\\) Let\n\\(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) be disjoint subsets of\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\). \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) d-separates \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) just in case every path \\((X_{1}, \\dots, X_{k})\\) from\na variable in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) to a variable in \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) contains\nat least one variable \\(X_{i}\\) such that either: (i) \\(X_{i}\\) is a\ncollider, and neither \\(X_{i}\\) nor any descendant of \\(X_{i}\\) is in\n\\(\\mathbf{Z}\\); or (ii) \\(X_{i}\\) is not a collider, and \\(X_{i}\\) is\nin \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\). In\n Figure 9,\n \\(\\{U, V\\}\\) d-separates \\(\\{Y\\}\\) and \\(\\{X\\}\\). The path\n\\(\\{Y, W, Z, X\\}\\) contains a collider at Z, and all other\npaths from Y to X include U or V as a\nnon-collider.\n\n\nThe Causal Markov Condition implies the generalized version of RCCP\npresented in\n Section 2.\n This is most easily seen using the d-separation version. If\nvariables X and Y are correlated, then \\(\\{X\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{Y\\}\\) are not d-separated by the empty set. This means\nthat at least one path between X and Y must be without a\ncollider. If we further assume that neither variable is a cause of the\nother, then there is no directed path between them. It then follows\nthat the collider-free path must contain a common cause: a variable\nZ that has both X and Y as descendants.\nFurthermore, the set of all such common causes d-separates\n\\(\\{X\\}\\) and \\(\\{Y\\}\\). (The proof is a bit fussy, since a common\ncause on one path can be a collider on another path.) Hence the set of\ncommon causes of X and Y will screen them off from one\nanother.\n\nNote that the Causal Markov Condition tells us that certain causal\nstructures give rise to relations of conditional probabilistic\nindependence. The Causal Markov Condition never entails\nprobabilistic dependence. For purposes of causal inference,\nthe Causal Markov Condition is often supplemented by a further\nprinciple governing when probabilistic dependence is to be expected.\nOne such principle is the Faithfulness Condition (Spirtes et\nal. 2000) which says that only the probabilistic\nindependencies entailed by the Causal Markov Condition are present.\nLooked at another way, the Faithfulness Condition says that when we\nfind a relation of conditional probabilistic independence, we should\ninfer a causal structure that entails that independence relation\nrather than one that doesn\u2019t.\n\nOne justification for assuming the Causal Markov Condition is a\ntheorem due to Pearl and Verma (1991). Suppose that we have a variable\nset \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), and DAG \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) representing the causal\nrelations among the variables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Suppose, in addition,\nthat the value of each variable X in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is a\ndeterministic function of its parents in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), together with\nan error variable \\(U_{X}\\), which represents the influence\nof any variables that are not included in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). In other\nwords, \\(X = f_{X}(\\PA(X), U_{X})\\). Then the values of all of the\nerror variables will uniquely determine the value of all of the\nvariables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), and a probability distribution \\(p^{*}\\)\nover the error variables will induce a probability distribution\np over the variables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). If the error variables\nare independent in \\(p^{*}\\), then the induced probability\ndistribution p will satisfy the Causal Markov Condition with\nrespect to \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). The idea is that if we include enough\nvariables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) so that any remaining causal influences\nare probabilistically independent of one another, then the probability\ndistribution over \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) will satisfy the Causal Markov\nCondition.\n\nA set of variables \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is causally sufficient if\nthere is no variable W omitted from \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), such that\nif it were added to \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), it would be a direct cause of two\nvariables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). In\n Figure 9,\n \\(\\{U, W, Y\\}\\) is causally sufficient (assuming the original DAG\nis), but \\(\\{U, W, Y, Z\\}\\) is not, since W and Z have a\ncommon cause, V, that is left out of this set.\n\nIt is usually assumed that if a variable set is causally sufficient,\nthen the error variables will be probabilistically independent, and\nthe probability distribution over \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) will satisfy the\nCausal Markov Condition with respect to the true causal graph. Note\nthat this assumption is very similar to the Common Cause Principle\nitself. If X and Y are variables included in a causally\nsufficient DAG, and \\(U_X\\) and \\(U_Y\\) are their corresponding error\nvariables, then neither \\(U_X\\) nor \\(U_Y\\) is a cause of the other,\nand they do not have a common cause. If they had a common cause, this\nwould be a common cause of X and Y; if \\(U_X\\) is a\ncause of \\(U_Y\\), then \\(U_X\\) is a common cause of X and\nY. So the causal sufficiency of the variable set implies that\n\\(U_X\\) and \\(U_Y\\) are causally unrelated. The Common Cause Principle\nwould then imply that they are probabilistically independent. Thus it\nwould be inaccurate to say that the Causal Markov Condition can be\nused to justify the Common Cause Principle: both involve\ncomparable assumptions about the relationship between causation and\nprobability.\n\nExamining the d-separation version of the Causal Markov\nCondition, we see that it is not common causes but rather colliders\nthat give rise to distinctive probabilistic relationships. Suppose\nthat we have a variable set with three variables \\(\\{X, Y, Z\\}\\), and\nthat the probability distribution p satisfies the Causal Markov\nCondition with respect to the true causal graph. Finally, suppose that\nX and Z are correlated, but screened off by Y.\nThen there are three different causal graphs that all imply just this\nset of probabilistic independence relations: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nX & \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\\\\nX & \\leftarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\\\\nX & \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe last of these, of course, is the Common Cause Structure\ncharacterized by Reichenbach. (However, Reichenbach also postulated\nthat intermediate causes would screen off distal causes from their\neffects, as indicated in the first two diagrams.) On the other hand,\nsuppose the relations of probabilistic (in)dependence are exactly the\nopposite. That is: X and Z are probabilistically\nindependent, but dependent conditional on Y. In this case,\nthere is only one causal structure that implies just this set of\nprobabilistic independence relations: \n\n\\[X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\]\n\n\nIndeed, algorithms for inferring causal structure from relations of\nconditional probabilistic dependence and independence, such as the\nPC algorithm of Spirtes et al. (2000), proceed by searching\nfor this type of probabilistic signature. Thus Reichenbach was\nmistaken in looking to conjunctive forks to define the direction of\ncausation (see\n Section 6\n above). He would have done better to look to colliders.\n",
