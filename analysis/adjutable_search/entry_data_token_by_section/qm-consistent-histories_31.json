    "main_text": "Difficulties and Objections\n11. Difficulties and Objections\nAny physical theory can give rise to various kinds of conceptual\ndifficulty. Problems may arise because of lack of familiarity with, or\nmisunderstanding of, new ideas. Most students upon their first\nencounter with calculus or with special relativity have difficulties\nof this sort, which can be cleared up by additional study, working\nthrough examples, and the like. In addition theories may be internally\ninconsistent. This is often the case when they are relatively new and\nunder development, but can also be true of more mature\ntheories. Indeed certain theories turn out to be of great usefulness\ndespite the fact that they contain serious flaws or\ninconsistencies. (Standard, which is to say textbook, quantum\nmechanics is a prime example!) And even theories which are properly\nunderstood and are internally consistent can be rejected, either by\nindividual scientists or the community as a whole, because they are\nnot \u201cgood physics\u201d, a term whose importance should not be\nunderestimated even if it cannot be given a precise definition. The\nhistories interpretation of quantum theory has given rise to\nconceptual difficulties that fall in all of these areas, and while it\nis impossible in a few words to discuss each of them in detail, the\nfollowing remarks are intended to indicate the general nature of some\nof the more serious issues raised by critics, along with responses\nmade by advocates of the histories approach. \n\n\n",
