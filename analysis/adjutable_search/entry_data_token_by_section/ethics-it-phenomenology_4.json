    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches to Technology\n2. Phenomenological Approaches to Technology\n\nWe started this discussion by suggesting that phenomenology\ninvestigates the conditions of what makes things appear as such, or,\nthat phenomenology suggests that there is a co-constitutive\nrelationship between us and the phenomena we encounter in our\nengagement with the world. Before we move on it might be helpful to\nclarify this point with a simple everyday example. Let us take the\nhuman experience of listening to music and consider it\nphenomenologically. From the perspective of physics and physiology,\nmusic is constituted by a flux of waves of particular frequencies to\nwhich the inner ear may be sensitive. Indeed, once so analyzed, it is\npossible to create a technological device such as a tape recorder that\nis sensitive to these same sounds, and can even replay them on\ncommand. Human beings, however, when they hear sounds in everyday life\nnever take them simply as a stream of sounds, rather they find\nthemselves already listening to something particular\u2014a cry for\nhelp, an automobile breaking, construction noise, or a piece of music.\nIndeed it would take a very strange sort of attitude to hear sounds\nand take them as a flux of waves of particular frequencies. Listening\nis different than registering or recording. To listen is to already\ntake sounds as this or that. In listening, the taking of sound as\nmusic implies an already existing sense of what music is, something\nthat makes it possible for us to take these sounds as music rather\nthan noise. Furthermore, in listening to music, this listening is\ninformed by an ongoing sense (or unity) of movement, rhythm, tone,\nscale, style, and so forth. This ongoing active unity provides an\nactive and ongoing framework (or necessary background) that enables\nme, in the experience of listening (right now), to simultaneously\n\u2018retain\u2019 the sounds I no longer hear (the past), and in\nanticipation to \u2018fill in\u2019 the sounds I am not yet hearing,\nyet already anticipate (the future). As a phenomenological being I\nfind myself listening to music, not merely recording sounds after the\nmanner of a technological device. For phenomenologists the relevant\nquestion is: What are the transcendental conditions that make it\npossible for humans to listen to music, as music, rather than merely\nrecord sounds?\n\nWhat is it that enables us to encounter music in its fullness even\nthough we are always given, at any particular point in time, only some\nlimited aspect of such a phenomenon (the current note I am hearing)?\nThe answer of phenomenology is that it is the transcendental\nhorizon or conditions that make our encounter with the world\npossible. One could say that the transcendental is the background, or\nhorizon, that makes the meaningful experience of the foreground\npossible. Yet insofar as such a formulation suggests a background that\nis somehow separate and \u2018behind\u2019 that which appears in the\nforeground, it would be incorrect. The transcendental horizon is\nalways and immediately already present in the very appearing as\nsuch\u2014this is exactly what makes a horizon\n\u2018disappear\u2019 or withdraw from our focal awareness. It is so\nevident that it simply does not come up as an issue. It is this\nseemingly \u2018forgotten\u2019 constitutive horizon that is the\nfocus of phenomenology. All phenomenological approaches have as their\nfocus a \u2018return\u2019 to this vital co-constitutive interplay\nbetween the \u2018foreground\u2019 and the \u2018background\u2019.\nThus, all phenomenological studies share at least the underlying view\nthat technology and society co-constitute each other by being each\nother\u2019s reciprocal and ongoing condition or possibility for\nbeing what they are. As such they continually draw on each other for\ntheir ongoing sense or meaning. For the purposes of this entry it\nmight be best to indicate some of the existing phenomenological\nstudies of technology in four different but intimately connected\nstrands (this is not a comprehensive list, it is rather indicative of\ncommon themes or approaches):\n\nPhenomenology as a fundamental critique of the technological\nattitude as such (Martin Heidegger 1977)\nOriginal technicity and the human being (Stiegler 1998,\n2009);\nThe technological attitude as manifested in our contemporary\nrelationship with particular technologies (Hubert Dreyfus 1992 and\nAlbert Borgmann 1984);\nA phenomenology of the human/technology relationship (Don Ihde\n1990).\n\n",
