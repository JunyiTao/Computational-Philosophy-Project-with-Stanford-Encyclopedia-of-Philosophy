    "main_text": "Critical Methods\n2. Critical Methods\n\nFrankfurt School critical theory is best characterized by a set of\nmethodological aspirations that set it apart from many other forms of\nsocial and political theorizing (both in philosophy and the social\nsciences): It aspires to be (1) self-reflexive, accounting\nfor its own embeddedness in specific social and historical conditions,\n(2) interdisciplinary, integrating philosophical analysis\nwith social theory and empirical social research, (3)\nmaterialist, grounding critical theorizing in social reality,\nand (4) emancipatory, orienting itself toward the goal of\nsocial emancipation. These commitments situate the Frankfurt School\nfirmly in the Marxist tradition, and that tradition\u2019s aim of\novercoming the division between theory and practice without\nuncritically subsuming one under the other.\n\nThis has given rise to three interrelated methodological challenges:\nhow to conceptualize (1) the relation of theory to social reality, (2)\nthe role and standpoint of critical theorists, and (3) the normative\nfoundations, content, or force of their critical theorizing. In light\nof historical developments in the first half of the twentieth century\n\u2013 the rise of fascism and Stalinism and the integration of the\nworking class into the liberal welfare state \u2013 Frankfurt School\ntheorists lost confidence in an identifiable direction of history or\nan identifiable collective subject like the proletariat to lead the\nway. It became increasingly unclear how to uphold a link between their\ntheories and a pre-theoretical anchor within social reality \u2013\nsuch as oppositional experiences, forms of consciousness, practices of\nresistance, or social struggles and movements \u2013 or even to see\nhow the conditions for any of those things to emerge were present at\nall.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this section first sketches the common ground\nmost Frankfurt School theorists find in the approach of immanent\ncritique\n (\u00a72.1)\n before tracing the various ways in which they have sought normative\nfoundations\n (\u00a72.2)\n in a more or less constructive or reconstructive\n (\u00a72.3)\n register, then turns to methods such as disclosive and genealogical\ncritique that are critical of those normative approaches\n (\u00a72.4),\n and concludes by outlining a set of methodological challenges that\nshape contemporary debates\n (\u00a72.5).\n",
