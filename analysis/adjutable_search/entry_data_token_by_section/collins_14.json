    "main_text": "Influences || In England\n6.1 In England\n\nWe have already considered in some detail Samuel Clarke\u2019s\nreaction to Collins\u2019 views about emergent properties, personal\nidentity and issues about determinism and free will in the early\neighteenth century. The Clarke Collins correspondence of 1707\u201308\nwas reprinted twice and referred to many times in the course of the\neighteenth century (Martin and Barresi 2000: 33). The conservative\nreaction to Locke and Collins concerning personal identity and\nmaterialism represented by Clarke continued to be maintained by many\nthinkers in eighteenth century England as well as on the continent. In\nfact, we can see an on-going debate between the materialists and\ndualists on these topics all the way through the eighteenth and into\nthe early nineteenth century in England.\n\nBishop Joseph Butler (1692\u20131752) a protege of Samuel Clarke\nattacked the Locke/Collins account of personal identity in the\nAppendix on Personal Identity to his Analogy of Religion.\nButler largely accepted Clarke\u2019s substantialist account of\nidentity and personal identity. Indeed he clarified Clarke\u2019s\nposition by summarizing it briefly and naming the distinction Clarke\nhad been making between real and fictional identity. He called it the\ndistinction between identity in the strict and proper sense and\nidentity in the loose and popular sense (Ducharme 1986: 370). He\nreiterates Clarke\u2019s claim that Collins\u2019 account of\npersonal identity is dangerous to religion and in particular the\ndoctrine of the resurrection. He accused Collins of taking\nLocke\u2019s doctrines \u201cto a strange length\u201d (Butler as\nquoted in Perry 2008: 102). By this Butler meant that Collins\u2019\naccount of personal identity would not allow a person\u2019s identity\nto persist for more than a moment and thus that Locke\u2019s account\nof personal identity implied and that Collins explicitly stated a\ndoctrine of successive persons. Butler claimed that such a doctrine\nwould destroy both morality and any doctrine of the resurrection. This\nhas been an influential misinterpretation of Collins (see Uzgalis\n2008a: 322\u2013326).\n\nGeorge Berkeley (1685\u20131753) met Collins at a freethinking coffee\nhouse meeting and later told his American follower, Samuel Johnson,\nthat Collins was an atheist. As noted earlier, Berkeley attacked the\nDiscourse of Free-Thinking in Steele\u2019s\nGuardian, and continued his attacks on Collins in\nAlciphron. While Berkeley holds a quite distinct set of\nphilosophical views from those of Clarke, together they represent a\nconservative Anglican response to Locke and Collins on the issue of\npersonal identity. Berkeley agrees with Clarke about the substantial\nnature of persons.\n\nScholars are still debating the influence of Collins on David Hume\n(1711\u20131776). How much influence is attributed to Collins depends\nlargely on the interpretation given to Hume\u2019s philosophy (see\nMcIntyre 1994, Russell 1995, and Harris 2005). McIntyre and Russell\ndespite their differences agree that in A Treatise Of Human\nNature Hume was systematically attacking Clarke\u2019s position\non the mind/body relation as articulated both in Clarke\u2019s Boyle\nlectures and the Clarke Collins correspondence of 1707\u201308 and\nthat many of Hume\u2019s arguments resemble those of Collins. Harris,\nfocusing on the issue of free will and determinism and using the\nEnquiries to interpret the Treatise, has a\ncontrasting view. He argues that Hume\u2019s account of necessity is\nweaker than \u201cthat defended by Collins and before him by\nHobbes\u201d, and he goes on to claim that in giving this weaker\naccount Hume is giving the same kind of account that Bramhall and\nClarke gave in trying to find a middle way between necessitarianism\nand the liberty of indifference (Harris 2005: 73). Harris may be\ncorrect in noting a variety of ways in which Hume\u2019s account of\ncausality and necessity differs from that of Hobbes, Locke and\nCollins. On the other hand, central to Hume\u2019s analysis of\ncausality is the total rejection of the a priori Homogeneity\nPrinciple and the necessary connection implicit in heirloom theories\nof causality. Collins also rejects the Homogeneity Principle, and\nheirloom theories of causality that underlie it. He strenuously denies\nthat any of the contradictions that are supposed to follow from\nviolating the Principle actually occur. These are clear similarities\nbetween Collins\u2019 account of causality and\nHume\u2019s that Harris fails to note. I think these considerations\ntend to weaken Harris\u2019 judgement that while Collins is a\ndogmatist on these issues, Hume is a skeptic (see Harris 2005: note 22\np. 79). \n\nThomas Reid (1710\u20131796) holds positions on materialism, personal\nidentity and free will that have much in common with the views of\nClarke. Reid deploys reduplication arguments in objecting to the views\nabout personal identity of Joseph Priestly (see Martin and Barresi\n2000: 47). Priestly\u2019s views have strong connections to those of\nLocke and Collins.\n\nJoseph Priestley (1733\u20131804) was sufficiently impressed with\nCollins\u2019 Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Free Will to\narrange the publication of a new edition of that work. Priestley also\nheld that matter can think, but his views were based on a different\nconception of matter than the one which Collins and Clarke shared.\nPriestley had an active conception of matter derived from Boscovich.\nPriestley was also impressed by Collins\u2019 work on the prophecies\n(Yolton 1983: 108\u2013113).\n",
