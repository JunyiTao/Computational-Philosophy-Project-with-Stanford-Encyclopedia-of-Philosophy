    "main_text": "Chance || \u2018Single-Case\u2019 Chance and Chance Processes\n1.1 \u2018Single-Case\u2019 Chance and Chance Processes\n\n\nChance, it is commonly said, is \u2018single-case objective\nprobability\u2019. Philosophers haven\u2019t been very clear on what is\nmeant by \u2018single-case\u2019, and the terminology is slightly\nmisleading, as it falsely suggests that perhaps multiple cases have\nless claim to their chances. The most minimal version of the claim is\nthat, at least sometimes, an outcome can have a chance to be a result\nof an instance of a given kind of process, or trial, even\nthough no other trials of that process occur. This is what we will\nmean by \u2018single case\u2019 chance. (A stronger claim is that\nthe chance of an outcome resulting from a given process is an\nintrinsic property of a single trial. The stronger claim is\ninconsistent with standard versions of the frequency theory, and\nindeed it can be difficult to see how chance and frequency might be\nconnected if that stronger claim were true.) Some have claimed that\nsingle-case chance is no part of objective probability; for example,\nvon Mises (1957: p. 11) remarks that the \u2018concept of probability\n\u2026 applies only to problems in which either the same event\nrepeats itself again and again, or a great number of uniform elements\nare involved at the same time.\u2019. However, this is a theoretical\njudgment on von Mises\u2019 part, based on difficulties he perceived in\ngiving an account of single-case chance; it is not a judgement derived\nfrom internal constraints on the chance role. And how could it be?\nFor\nlike it or not, we have this concept [of single-case\nchance]. We think that a coin about to be tossed has a certain chance\nof falling heads, or that a radioactive atom has a certain chance of\ndecaying within the year, quite regardless of what anyone may believe\nabout it and quite regardless of whether there are any other similar\ncoins or atoms. As philosophers we may well find the concept of\nobjective chance troublesome, but that is no excuse to deny its\nexistence, its legitimacy, or its indispensability. If we can\u2019t\nunderstand it, so much the worse for us. (Lewis, 1980: 90)\n\n\nA number of the constraints discussed above require the legitimacy\nof single-case chance. The objection to frequentist accounts of chance\nthat the frequency might misrepresent the chance if the number of\nactual outcomes is too low apparently requires that there be\nnon-trivial chances even for events resulting from a type of trial that\noccurs only very few times, and perhaps even can only occur very few\ntimes (H\u00e1jek 2009: 227\u20138). The strong connections between\npossibility and chance mooted by the BCP and variants thereof also\nrequire that there are single-case chances. For the BCP requires that,\nfor every event with some chance, it is possible that the event has\nthat same chance and occurs. As noted in Supplement\n A.2,\n this renders the chances\nrelatively independent of the occurrent frequencies, which in turn\nrequires single-case chance. For some single outcomes\u2014for\nexample, the next toss of a coin that is biased \u2154 towards\nheads\u2014only very few assignments of credence are reasonable; in\nthat case, we should, if we are rational, have credence of \u2154 in the\ncoin landing heads. The rationality of this unequal assignment cannot\nbe explained by anything like symmetry or indifference. Its rationality\ncan be explained by the PP only if the single-case chance of heads on\nthe next toss is \u2154. Moreover, the existence of this constraint on\nrational credence should have an explanation. Therefore the PP, if it\nis to play this necessary explanatory role, requires single-case\nchance.\n\n\nIt is the stable trial principle that has the closest connection\nwith single-case chance, however. For in requiring that duplicate\ntrials should receive the same chances, it is natural to take the\nchance to be grounded in the properties of that trial, plus the laws of\nnature. It is quite conceivable that the same laws could obtain even if\nthat kind of trial has only one instance, and the very same chances\nshould be assigned in that situation. But then there are well-defined\nchances even though that type of event occurs only once.\n\n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that chance is a process\nnotion, rather than being entirely determined by features of the\noutcome to which the surface grammar of chance ascriptions assigns the\nchance. For if there can be a single-case chance of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for a coin to\nland heads on a toss even if there is only one actual toss, and it\nlands tails, then surely the chance cannot be fixed by properties of\nthe outcome \u2018lands heads\u2019, as that outcome does not\n exist.[2]\n The chance must rather be grounded in features\nof the process that can produce the outcome: the coin-tossing trial,\nincluding the mass distribution of the coin and the details of how it\nis tossed, in this case, plus the background conditions and laws that\ngovern the trial. Whether or not an event happens by chance is a\nfeature of the process that produced it, not the event itself. The fact\nthat a coin lands heads does not fix that the coin landed heads by\nchance, because if it was simply placed heads up, as opposed to tossed\nin a normal fashion, we have the same outcome not by chance. Sometimes\nfeatures of the outcome event cannot be readily separated from the\nfeatures of its causes that characterise the process by means of which\nit was produced. But the upshot of the present discussion is that even\nin those cases, whether an outcome happens by chance is fixed by the\nproperties of the process leading up to it, the causal situation in\nwhich it occurs, and not simply by the fact that an event of a given\ncharacter was the product of that\n process.[3]\n",
