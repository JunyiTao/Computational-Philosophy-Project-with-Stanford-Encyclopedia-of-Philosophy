The agent might be\nan individual person, or it might be a group of people, or an\ninstitution such as the state. So we cannot, except metaphorically,\ndescribe as unjust states of affairs that no agent has contributed to\nbringing about \u2013 unless we think that there is a Divine Being\nwho has ordered the universe in such a way that every outcome is a\nmanifestation of His will. Admittedly we are tempted to make\njudgements of what is sometimes called \u2018cosmic injustice\u2019\n\u2013 say when a talented person\u2019s life is cut cruelly short\nby cancer, or our favourite football team is eliminated from the\ncompetition by a freak goal \u2013 but this is a temptation we should\nresist.\n\nThis agency condition, however, is less restrictive than it might at\nfirst appear. It by no means excludes the possibility that agents can\ncreate injustice by omission \u2013 for example by failing to create\nthe institutions or to enact the policies that would deliver vital\nresources to those who need them. Thus it is now common to speak of\n\u2018systemic injustice\u2019 in the case of bad outcomes that\nno-one intends to occur but that could be prevented by a shift in\nsocial norms or institutional practices. The agents in these cases are\nall those who by acting together to change these things could invert\nthe injustice, but have so far failed to do so.\n",
