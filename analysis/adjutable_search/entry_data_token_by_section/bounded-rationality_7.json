    "main_text": "The Emergence of Procedural Rationality || Satisficing\n2.2 Satisficing\n\nSatisficing is the strategy of considering the options available to\nyou for choice until you find one that meets or exceeds a predefined\nthreshold\u2014your aspiration level\u2014for a minimally acceptable\noutcome. Although Simon originally thought of procedural rationality\nas a poor approximation of global rationality, and thus viewed the\nstudy of bounded rationality to concern \u201cthe behavior of human\nbeings who satisfice because they have not the wits to\nmaximize\u201d (Simon 1957a: xxiv), there are a range of\napplications of satisficing models to sequential choice problems,\naggregation problems, and high-dimensional optimization problems,\nwhich are increasingly common in machine learning.\n\nGiven a specification of what will count as a good-enough outcome,\nsatisficing replaces the optimization objective from expected utility\ntheory of selecting an undominated outcome with the objective of\npicking an option that meets your aspirations. The model has since\nbeen applied to business (Bazerman & Moore 2008; Puranam,\nStieglitz, Osman, & Pillutla 2015), mate selection (Todd &\nMiller 1999) and other practical sequential-choice problems, like\nselecting a parking spot (Hutchinson, Fanselow, et al. 2012). Ignoring\nthe procedural aspects of Simon\u2019s original formulation of\nsatisficing, if one has a fixed aspirational level for a given\ndecision problem, then admissible choices from satisficing can be\ncaptured by so-called \\(\\epsilon\\)-efficiency methods (Loridan 1984;\nWhite 1986).\n\nHybrid optimization-satisficing techniques are used in machine\nlearning when many metrics are available but no sound or practical\nmethod is available for combining them into a single value. Instead,\nhybrid optimization-satisficing methods select one metric to optimize\nand satisfice the remainder. For example, a machine learning\nclassifier might optimize accuracy (i.e., maximize the proportion of\nexamples for which the model yields the correct output; see\n section 8.2)\n but set aspiration levels for the false positive rate, coverage, and\nruntime.\n\nSelten\u2019s aspiration adaption theory models decision\ntasks as problems with multiple incomparable goals that resist\naggregation into a complete preference order over all alternatives\n(Selten 1998). Instead, the decision-maker will have a vector of goal\nvariables, where those vectors are comparable by weak dominance. If\nvector A and vector B are possible assignments for my goals, then A\ndominates vector B if there is no goal in the sequence in which B\nassigns a value that is strictly less than A, and there is some goal\nfor which A assigns a value strictly greater than B. Selten\u2019s\nmodel imagines an aspiration level for each goal, which itself can be\nadjusted upward or downwards depending on the set of feasible\n(admissible) options. Aspiration adaption theory is a highly\nprocedural and local account in the tradition of Newell and\nSimon\u2019s approach to human problem solving (Newell & Simon\n1972), although it was not initially offered as a psychological\nprocess model. Analogous approaches have been explored in the AI\nplanning literature (Bonet & Geffner 2001; Ghallab, Nau, &\nTraverso 2016).\n",
