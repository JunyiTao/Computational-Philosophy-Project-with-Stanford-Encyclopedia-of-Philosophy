    "main_text": "Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of effective method and decision method || Newman and the Cambridge mathematicians\n2.6 Newman and the Cambridge mathematicians\n\nThe connection Behmann emphasized between the decision problem and a\nmachine that carries out an \u201cexercise in computation\u201d\nwould soon prove crucial in Turing\u2019s hands. What seems to have\nbeen Turing\u2019s first significant brush with the\nEntscheidungsproblem was in 1935, in a Cambridge lecture given by\nNewman. Newman, a mathematical logician and topologist, was very\nfamiliar with the ideas emanating from G\u00f6ttingen. As early as\n1923 he gave a left-field discussion of some of Hilbert\u2019s ideas,\nhimself proposing an approach to the foundations of mathematics that,\nwhile radical and new, nevertheless had a strongly Hilbertian flavor\n(Newman 1923). In 1928, Newman attended an international congress of\nmathematicians in the Italian city of Bologna, where Hilbert talked\nabout the Entscheidungsproblem while lecturing on his proof theory\n(Hilbert 1930a; Zanichelli 1929). Hilbert\u2019s leading works in\nmathematical logic\u2014Hilbert and Ackermann (1928) and Hilbert and\nBernays (1934)\u2014were both recommended reading for Newman\u2019s\nown lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics (Smithies 1934;\nCopeland and Fan 2022).\n\nSpeaking in a tape-recorded interview about Turing\u2019s engagement\nwith the Entscheidungsproblem, Newman said \u201cI believe it all\nstarted because he attended a lecture of mine on foundations of\nmathematics and logic\u201d:\n\n\nI think I said in the course of this lecture that what is meant by\nsaying that [a] process is constructive is that it\u2019s a purely\nmechanical machine\u2014and I may even have said, a machine can do\nit.\n\nAnd this of course led [Turing] to the next challenge, what sort of\nmachine, and this inspired him to try and say what one would mean by a\nperfectly general computing machine. (Newman c1977)\n\n\nSadly, there seems to be no record of what else Newman said at that\ncrucial juncture in his lecture. However, his 1923 paper \u201cThe\nFoundations of Mathematics from the Standpoint of Physics\u201d does\nrecord some of his related thinking (Copeland & Fan 2023). There\nhe introduced the term \u201cprocess\u201d (which he also used in\nthe above quotation), saying \u201cAll logic and mathematics consist\nof certain processes\u201d (1923: 12). He emphasized the\nrequirement that a process should terminate with the required\nresult (such as a theorem or number); and he gave a formal treatment\nof processes:\n\n\nThe properties of processes are formally developed from a set of\naxioms, and a general method reached for attacking the problem of\nwhether a given process terminates or not. (Newman 1923: 12)\n\n\nNewman did not mention the Entscheidungsproblem in his 1923\npaper\u2014let alone moot its unsolvability (there is no evidence\nthat, pre-Turing, he thought the problem unsolvable)\u2014yet, with\nhindsight, he certainly laid some suggestive groundwork for an attack\non the problem. He wrote:\n\n\nThe information of the first importance to be obtained about a process\nor segment of a process is whether it is possible to perform\nit\u2026. The statement that [process] \\(\\Phi|\\,|\\alpha\\rho\\) is\npossible means that this process terminates: comes to a halt\n\u2026 (Newman 1923: 39)\n\n\nNewman even proposed an \u201capparatus\u201d, a \u201csymbolic\nmachine\u201d, for producing numbers by means of carrying out\nprocesses of the sort he analysed, and he gave a profound discussion\nof real numbers from the standpoint of this proposal (1923:\n130ff).\n\nNor was Newman the only person at Cambridge with an interest in the\nEntscheidungsproblem. The Entscheidungsproblem was \u201cin the\nair\u201d there during the decade leading up to Turing\u2019s\nassault on it. The Sadleirian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge,\nHardy, took an interest in the problem, inspired by von\nNeumann\u2019s magisterial exposition and critique of Hilbert\u2019s\nideas (von Neumann 1927). Ackermann himself had visited Cambridge from\nG\u00f6ttingen for the first half of 1925 (Zach 2003: 226). Another\nvisitor, Langford\u2014who worked in Cambridge on a fellowship from\nHarvard for the academic year 1924\u201325 (Frankena & Burks\n1964)\u2014presented a series of results to the American Mathematical\nSociety not long after his return to Harvard, in effect solving a\nnumber of special cases of the Entscheidungsproblem (Langford 1926a,\n1927).\n\nThe Cambridge logician Ramsey, like Turing a Fellow of King\u2019s\nCollege, also worked on the Entscheidungsproblem in the latter part of\nthe 1920s. He died in 1930 (the year before Turing arrived in\nCambridge as an undergraduate), but not before completing a key paper\nsolving the Entscheidungsproblem in special cases (Ramsey 1930). His\nwork, too, was prominent in the recommended reading for Newman\u2019s\nlecture course. Braithwaite, another Fellow of King\u2019s College\n(who had a hand in Turing\u2019s election to a junior research\nfellowship at King\u2019s in 1935), was keenly interested in\nRamsey\u2019s work on the Entscheidungsproblem (Copeland & Fan\n2022). Also in 1935, von Neumann visited Cambridge from Princeton, for\nthe term following Newman\u2019s lecture course (Copeland & Fan\n2023). Von Neumann, a member of the G\u00f6ttingen group during the\nmid-1920s, had called the Entscheidungsproblem \u201cprofound and\ncomplex\u201d, and he voiced doubts that it was solvable (von Neumann\n1927: 11; 1931: 120).\n\nHe was not alone. Hardy gave this statement of the\nEntscheidungsproblem, in the course of a famous discussion of\nHilbert\u2019s ideas:\n\n\nSuppose, for example, that we could find a finite system of rules\nwhich enabled us to say whether any given formula was demonstrable or\nnot. (Hardy 1929: 16)\n\n\nHardy foresaw what Turing, and Church, would soon prove, telling his\naudience that such a system of rules \u201cis not to be\nexpected\u201d.\n\nWhat Turing showed is that there will never be, and can never be, a\ncomputing machine satisfying the following specification: When the\nuser types in a formula\u2014any formula\u2014of the functional\ncalculus, the machine carries out a finite number of steps and then\noutputs the correct answer, either \u201cThis formula is provable in\nthe functional calculus\u201d or \u201cThis formula is not provable\nin the functional calculus\u201d, as the case may be. Given,\ntherefore, Turing\u2019s thesis that if an effective method\nexists then it can be carried out by one of his machines, it\nfollows that there is no effective method for deciding the full\nfirst-order functional calculus.\n",
