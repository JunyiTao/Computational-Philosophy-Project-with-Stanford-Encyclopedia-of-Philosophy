    "main_text": "The nature of Sextus\u2019 Pyrrhonism (PH I) || What do Skeptics do, and where do they get their name?\n3.1 What do Skeptics do, and where do they get their name?\n\n\nWhen you investigate whether P, there are three possibilities: (i)\nyou discover something (you find that the reasons for believing one of\nP and not-P outweigh any reasons for believing the other), or (ii) you\ndeny that it is possible to discover whether P, or (iii) you find that\nso far, the reasons for believing that P and the reasons for believing\nthat not-P balance each other out, and so you keep on investigating\n(PH I 1). So-called \u2018Dogmatic\u2019 philosophers think\nthey make discoveries when they investigate; \u2018Academic\u2019\nskeptics assert that no discovery can be made; Pyrrhonists carry on\ninvestigating and searching for the truth (I 3). (For the sincerity of\nthis last claim, see Palmer 2000 and Perin 2006.) This, continues\nSextus, is why Skeptics get their name (I 7): \u2018to\ninvestigate\u2019 in Greek is skeptesthai, and so\nskeptikos means something like \u2018one who is disposed to\ninvestigate\u2019, \u2018investigator\u2019.\n\n\nIf Pyrrhonian Skeptics are still investigating any matter you like,\nthere is no distinctive set of beliefs which mark them out as a school.\nAmongst the things Platonists believe is the proposition that the only\ntruly real things are Forms (and their discovery of this is what their\ninvestigation into the question \u2018what is there?\u2019 culminated\nin), and amongst the things Aristotelians believe is the proposition\nthat the soul is the actuality of the living body as such (and their\ndiscovery of this is what their investigation into the question\n\u2018what is the soul?\u2019 culminated in). Holding these beliefs\nis partially constitutive of what it is to be an Aristotelian or a\nPlatonist. Skeptics have not yet found answers to those questions,\nbecause they are still investigating them. It follows that to be a\nSkeptic is not to subscribe to a set of beliefs in the way that members\nof the other Philosophical Schools do. Yet there must be something\nabout them that makes them count as Skeptics. What, then, is\nSkepticism? Sextus\u2019 answer is that it is an ability or skill (I\n8), not a set of beliefs. \n \nSextus presents scepticism as a kind\nof philosophy, distinguished from others not by the content of its\ndoctrines (there are none), but apparently by its attitude to\nphilosophical problems and theses. (Striker 2001: 114; cf.\nMorison 2011: 265\u20139)\n",
