    "main_text": "Ontological Holism in Quantum Mechanics?\n9. Ontological Holism in Quantum Mechanics?\n\nAs applied to physics,\n ontological holism\n is the thesis that there are physical objects that are not wholly\ncomposed of basic physical parts. Views of Bohr, Bohm and others may\nbe interpreted as endorsing some version of this thesis. In no case is\nit claimed that any physical object has nonphysical parts.\nThe idea is rather that some physical entities that we take to be\nwholly composed of a particular set of basic physical parts are in\nfact not so composed.\n\nIt was Bohr\u2019s (1934) view that one can meaningfully ascribe\nproperties such as position or momentum to a quantum system only in\nthe context of some well-defined experimental arrangement suitable for\nmeasuring the corresponding property. He used the expression\n\u2018quantum phenomenon\u2019 to describe what happens in such an\narrangement. In his view, then, although a quantum phenomenon is\npurely physical, it is not composed of distinct happenings involving\nindependently characterizable physical objects\u2014the quantum\nsystem on the one hand, and the classical apparatus on the other. And\neven if the quantum system may be taken to exist outside the context\nof a quantum phenomenon, little or nothing can then be meaningfully\nsaid about its properties. It would therefore be a mistake to consider\na quantum object to be an independently existing component part of the\napparatus-object whole.\n\nBohm\u2019s (1980, 1993) reflections on quantum mechanics led him to\nadopt a more general holism. He believed that not just quantum object\nand apparatus, but any collection of quantum objects by themselves,\nconstitute an indivisible whole. This may be made precise in the\ncontext of Bohm\u2019s (1952) interpretation of quantum mechanics by\nnoting that a complete specification of the state of the\n\u201cundivided universe\u201d requires not only a listing of all\nits constituent particles and their positions, but also of a field\nassociated with the wave-function that guides their trajectories. If\none assumes that the basic physical parts of the universe are just the\nparticles it contains, then this establishes ontological holism in the\ncontext of Bohm\u2019s interpretation. But there are alternative\nviews of the ontology of the Bohm theory (see the entry\n Bohmian mechanics).\n\nSome (Howard 1989; Dickson 1998) have connected the failure of a\nprinciple of separability to ontological holism in the context of\nviolations of Bell inequalities. Howard (1989) formulates the\nfollowing separability principle (pp. 225\u20136)\n\nHoward Separability:\n The contents of any two regions of space-time separated by a\nnonvanishing spatiotemporal interval constitute separable physical\nsystems, in the sense that (1) each possesses its own, distinct\nphysical state, and (2) the joint state of the two systems is wholly\ndetermined by these separate states.\n\n\nHe takes Einstein to defend this as a principle of individuation of\nphysical systems, without which physical thought \u201cin the sense\nfamiliar to us\u201d would not be possible. Howard himself\ncontemplates the possible failure of this principle for\n entangled quantum systems,\n with the consequence that these could no longer be taken to be wholly\ncomposed of what are typically regarded as their subsystems. Dickson\n(1998), on the other hand, argues that such holism is not \u201ca\ntenable scientific doctrine, much less an explanatory one\u201d (p.\n156).\n\nOne may try to avoid the conclusion that experimental violations of\nBell inequalities manifest a failure of\n Local Action\n by invoking ontological holism for events. The idea would be to deny\nthat these experiments involve distinct, spatiotemporally separate,\nmeasurement events, and to maintain instead that what we usually\ndescribe as separate measurements involving an entangled system in\nfact constitute one indivisible, spatiotemporally disconnected, event\nwith no spatiotemporal parts. But such ontological holism conflicts\nwith the criteria of individuation of events inherent in both quantum\ntheory and experimental practice.\n",
