So far\nas syllogistic was concerned, some logicians, such as Lambert of\nAuxerre (or Lagny) gave a standard account of the Aristotelian\nsyllogism which is centered on the universal and particular\nquantification of general terms at the same time as they gave examples\nwith singular terms, such as \u201cEvery man is an animal, Socrates\nis a man, therefore Socrates is an animal.\u201d More detailed\npresentations of syllogistic included an account of the expository\nsyllogism, which is in the third figure and has a singular middle\nterm, and of other syllogisms with singular terms. Such syllogisms\nwere said to be governed by the two principles \u201cWhen two things\nare the same as a third, they are the same as each other\u201d and\n\u201cWhen one of two things is the same as a third and one is not,\nthen the two things are not the same as each other.\u201d The\nexistence of syllogisms with singular terms could be thought to cast\ndoubt on such general syllogistic principles as \u201cOne premise\nmust always be universal\u201d and \u201cNothing follows from two\nparticular premises.\u201d Lambert dealt with the former problem by\nappealing to the formulation \u201cEverything that is Socrates runs,\nSocrates is a man, therefore a man runs.\u201d Buridan preferred to\nreject the first principle, and John Dorp explained that the second\nprinciple did not apply unless one specified that\n\u2018particular\u2019 was used in the narrow sense of\n\u2018neither universal nor singular\u2019. In the seventeenth\ncentury, some logicians were to treat singular propositions as\nequivalent to universal propositions, but, as Dorp\u2019s remarks suggest,\nmedieval logicians preferred to class singular propositions with\nparticular propositions.\n\n\nAnother place in which singular terms were used was suppositional\ndescent, as when one infers from \u201cEvery man is running\u201d\nthat Socrates is running or Plato is running or Cicero is running, or that\nthis man is running, and that man is running. In the earlier Middle\nAges, logicians did not seem to worry about the use of proper names as\nopposed to demonstrative phrases, but there was some discussion of\npossible problems in the later period. One problem had to do with the\nfact that there are different types of singular name. Men are called\nSocrates, Plato and Cicero, but donkeys are called Brownie\n(Brunellus), Tawny (Favellus) and Little Grey\n(Grisellus), so what happens if someone produces the inference,\n\u201cEvery man is running, therefore Brownie is running and Tawny is\nrunning\u201d? After all, this inference has exactly the same logical\nform as \u201cEvery man is running, therefore Socrates is running and\nPlato is running.\u201d Moreover, even if one has the correct type of\nproper name, its bearer may die, rendering the conclusion false while\nthe premise remains true. If one adopts the preferred solution of\nreplacing proper names by demonstrative phrases, a similar problem\narises. If \u2018this\u2019 does not succeed in pointing to a living\nman, then \u201cEvery man is running, therefore this man is\nrunning\u201d may have a true premise and a false conclusion. The\nproblem was dealt with by the provision of extra premises which\nensured that the very same things referred to by a true premise are\nthe things referred to by the demonstrative phrases in the\nconclusion.\n\n\nThe problem of reference to dead men was also discussed by\nlogicians. There were three issues. First, there was the problem of\nwords used of a living man and of a corpse. Following Aristotle\n(Meteorology 389b31), and also Augustine\u2019s On Dialectic,\nlogicians were content to accept that if I point to a corpse and say\n\u201cThis is a man\u201d or \u201cThis is Peter,\u201d then\n\u2018man\u2019 and \u2018Peter\u2019 are being used equivocally,\nin some different or extended sense.  Second, there was the problem of\nestablishing a referent for such claims as \u201cAdam was in\nParadise\u201d or \u201cAdam is dead.\u201d Here supposition theory\ncame into play, for it allowed reference to past objects as well as\npresent objects, future objects, and possible objects. Third, there\nwas the problem which was the focus of special attention in the second\nhalf of the thirteenth century, namely whether the proposition\n\u201cCaesar is a man\u201d can be true when Caesar is dead. This\nquestion had to do in large part with the interpretation of\n\u2018is\u2019, but what concerns us here is the related issue of\nwhether proper names lost their signification when their bearer\ndied. If they do, it seems that any discussion of the past will be\nsenseless. The answers given show the particular importance of the\nplace of the mind in signification.  For instance, Boethius of Dacia\nwrote \u201cafter Socrates\u2019s destruction \u2018Socrates\u2019\nsignifies such a being as Socrates once was\u2026when the\nreal thing has been destroyed, conceiving of that thing is possible\nfor the intellect as it was earlier; for it is possible to think the\nthing after its destruction. Therefore, it is also possible to signify\nthe thing by means of an utterance as it was earlier.\u201d An\nopposing view was presented by Roger Bacon, who held that proper names\nwere radically equivocal because they were subject to constant\nreimposition. The person who cries out \u201cJohn is dead,\u201d\nintending to refer either to a thing of the past or to a corpse, has\ngiven a new imposition to the word \u2018John\u2019, even if his\ngrief prevents him from realizing this.\n\n\nOne issue that did not arise is that of fictional names. Medieval\nlogicians were concerned with problems of reference to dead persons,\nor to fictional entities such as chimeras or the phoenix, but I have\nyet to come across any discussion of fictional singular terms such as\nFrodo Baggins or Harry Potter. Buridan remarked that one might acquire\nfictitious singular concepts in dreams, but he did not speak of naming\ntheir non-existent objects. Perhaps the nearest anyone came to raising\nthe problem of fictional names was hinted at in an early\nfifteenth-century discussion by Nicholas of Amsterdam. He mentioned\nthe problem of Antichrist, who is named, though he does not yet\nexist. The solution depended on the claims that signification involves\nan aptitude, and that since Antichrist would exist in the future, he\nwould then give rise to a genuine singular concept \n",
