    "main_text": "Selected Existence Questions || Two-Dimensional Isotopes of Boolean Connectives (Longer Example 7)\n5. Notes and Sources\n \nUnless otherwise stated, page and (sub)section references in this\ninitial paragraph all pertain to Humberstone (2011), where several of\nthe topics touched on this entry are treated at greater length. For\nexample, the treatment of unique characterization in Section\n 3 of the present entry is largely based on\n\u00a74.3 there. (Some issues touched on here are, however, not\ntreated there at all or are addressed in greater detail here.) In\nconnection with note 6 in the present entry,\nconcerning Carnap's observation that the most familiar logical\nframeworks do not force a Boolean interpretation on the connectives\ntreated by the rules they make available, references to some of the\nmany discussions of this theme can be found under \u2018Strong\nvs. Weak Claim\u2019 on p.\u00a0101. Apropos of\nnote 10 (on sentence-position extensionality) in\nthe present entry, referring the reader to this opening paragraph, see\n\u00a73.2 and subsections 4.37\u20138. For the end of\nnote 11 (the commutativity/symmetry distinction\netc.), what is relevant is subsection 3.34, \u201cOperations\nvs. Relations\u201d (though for more on specifically the relational\nside of that contrast, see Humberstone 2013, especially \u00a74). In\nconnection with note 17 (on\n\u2018non-homophonic\u2019 semantic treatments of disjunction), see\nsubsections 6.43\u20136.46 for a survey of some of these treatments,\nand for note 21 (on separately conservative but\njointly non-conservative extension by new connectives with\nprescribed inferential properties), see p.\u00a0568f. \nFor note 32 (on\nsome of Rautenberg's work on what we are calling hybrids of connectives), see alternatively subsection 3.24. For\nnote 41 (appended to a discussion of contrariety\nand subcontrariety), a more detailed discussion can be found in\nsubsection 8.11 and references given there (especially in Remark\n8.11.1). Expanding on note 45: \u00a75.2 goes\ninto more detail on logical subtraction\n(Example 4.4 above); interesting work by\nStephen Yablo on this topic, mentioned there as then unpublished,\nsubsequently appeared in Yablo (2014), Chapters 8 and 9 being of\nparticular relevance. Apropos of note 55: for an example of a Hasse diagram of the 16-element Boolean algebra, nodes labelled with representatives of the classical equivalence classes of two-variable formulas, see Figure\n2.13a on p.\u00a0225. The bearing on logical theory of the topic of the following paragraph of the present section, Galois connections, is stressed in material on pp.\u00a058f., 75 and 80 in \u00a71.1; the list of\n\u2018Galois connection\u2019 oriented discussions of logical\nmatters given in the bottom paragraph of p.\u00a0101 should be\nsupplemented by a reference to Bimb\u00f3 and Dunn (2008). Finally,\nto supplement the Urquhart reference given at the end of the present section\non head linkage as a special relation in intuitionistic logic, see\nsubsection 9.25. The remainder of the present section gives further\nadditional notes and sources on the present entry working through in\norder.\n\nThe Galois connections described in the opening section are what are\nsometimes called contravariant (as opposed to covariant) Galois\nconnections; they were introduced in somewhat different terminology by\nGarrett Birkhoff (1967). Closure operations as defined in the opening\nsection are sometimes called closure operators. Note that the\ndefinition given, although standard, is much less restrictive than the\nnotion of a specifically topological closure operation (in\nparticular, not requiring C(X\n\u222a Y) = C(X)\n\u222a C(Y)\nor C(\u2205) = \u2205,). Some\nauthors discuss matters of logical theory placing a particular\nemphasis on closure operations and their systems of closed sets (sets\nX with C(X) =\nX); see Pollard and Martin (1996) and references there\ncited.\n\nThe phrase \u201clogical frameworks\u201d has been used in ways\nother than that introduced in Section\n 2,\n e.g., in Huet and Plotkin (1991). The use of \u201c\u227b\u201d\nhere as a sequent separator is occasioned by current HTML font\nlimitations; its general use for that purpose is not recommended.\nCarnap\u2019s observation about logic pursued in \nSet-Fmla\nnot being capable\nof enforcing the intended truth-functional interpretation of various\nconnectives (such as \u2228, \u00ac, and \u2192) has received extensive\nattention in the literature, as was mentioned in the first paragraph of this section. The term \u201ccongruential\u201d\nused here is taken from Segerberg (1982); it is based on a related use\nof the term by D. Makinson (for modal logics in Fmla\ncontaining \u2610 \u03c6 \u2194 \u2610 \u03c8\nwhenever they contain \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8). In some quarters the term\n\u201cself-extensional\u201d is used for congruentiality, while in\nothers the term \u201cextensional\u201d\u2014used quite differently\nhere\u2014is used for this property.\n\nThe emphasis on (bivalent) valuations throughout our discussion may\nsuggest some limitation of scope: are we not excluding\n\u2018many-valued logic\u2019 (or better: matrix semantics)? And\nwhat about Kripke style semantics in which truth is doubly relativized\nnot only to a model but to a point therein? No, there is no\nlimitation. Every (generalized) consequence relation is determined by\na class of valuations. The matrix assignments of values to formulas\nare homomorphisms from the algebra L of formulas to the algebra\nA\u2014presumed to be of the same similarity type of\nL\u2014of a matrix (A, D), where D\n\u2286 A; D is called the set of designated elements\nof the matrix. Thus the compositional semantics is done in terms of\nsuch homomorphisms, any one of which, h, say, gives rise to a\nbivalent valuation vh defined by setting\nvh(\u03c6) = T iff h(\u03c6)\n\u2208 D, and a Set-Fmla\nor Set-Set\nsequent is valid in the matrix just in case it\nholds\u2014in the usual bivalent sense\u2014on the valuation\nvh for every such homomorphism\nh, the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nmatrix is the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nclass of all such vh,\n etc.[56]\n Similarly for classes of matrices, with the quantification now over\nall vh where h is a homomorphism\nfrom the language to any matrix in the class. Likewise, in the\nKripke-semantical case, any model M and\npoint x therein gives rise to the valuation\nvMx\ndefined by\nvMx(\u03c6)\n= T iff\nM\u22a8x\n\u03c6,\nand the (generalized) consequence relation determined by a class of\nmodels is that determined by all such vMx\nwith M\nin the class. (This is the so-called\nlocal (generalized) consequence relation; for the global\nvariant, use valuations vM\nwith vM(\u03c6)\n= T iff for all points\nx in the model, M\u22a8x\n\u03c6.) There is\nan obvious further adaptation of these definitions if one wants a\nformulation in terms of determination by (\u201csoundness and\ncompleteness with respect to\u201d) a class of frames rather than\nmodels.\n\nAs well as Prior (1957) cited in Section\n 2\n on the \u0141-modal system, the following references are useful:\nSmiley (1961), Smiley (1962), Porte (1979), Font and H\u00e1jek\n(2002). The original paper is \u0141ukasiewicz (1953).\n\nThe problem with a live-and-let-live attitude toward differences\nbetween logics differing over the logical powers of a connective when\nthe weaker set of powers already suffice for unique characterization\n(\u00aci vs. \u00acc in Section\n 3)\n was already pointed out in Popper (1948), and often re-surfaces in\nsubsequent literature e.g., Harris (1982), Hand (1993), Fari\u00f1as del Cerro and Herzig (1996); see also the opening paragraph of the present section. Uniquely\ncharacterized connectives are sometimes spoken of as implicitly\ndefined, but there are definite risks involved in the latter\nusage\u2014see Do\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1985). The\n\u201cimplicit\u201d in the title of Caicedo (2004) does not carry\nquite the same risks, and refers to a special case of unique\ncharacterization, essentially amounting to unique characterization by\nzero-premiss rules in Fmla\u2014i.e., by\naxioms. Similarly, the \u201cfunctionally dependent\u201d\nconnectives of Smiley (1962) are those uniquely characterized by\nzero-premiss rules, taken in concert with the standard structural\nrules, in Set-Fmla\u2014though\nSmiley\u2019s definition is put\nin terms of consequence relations. This class of connectives may well\ncoincide with the class of projection-conjunction connectives. It does\nnot include disjunction or implication, as treated in intuitionistic\nor classical logic, which are uniquely characterized by rules\nessentially containing a non-zero-premiss rule\u2014though these\nwould be uniquely characterized by zero-premiss rules (together with\nthe structural rules) in Set-Set.\nMakinson (2014) also addresses questions of\nexistence and uniqueness in connection with connectives, but his\nexistence questions concern, not the existence of a connective\nsatisfying certain rules (or more generally, certain conditions), but\nthe existence of rules (or this or that kind) satisfied by a given\nconnective, where connectives are individuated semantically (more\nspecifically, by association with bivalent truth-functions). The\nvarious notions of uniqueness considered by Makinson do apply to\nconnectives rather than rules, and are defined in terms of the rules\nsatisfied but the connectives themselves are again individuated\ntruth-functionally and so none ends up amouting to unique\ncharacterization as understood here. See note 1, p.\u00a0365, in\nMakinson (2014) for a discussion contrasting his concerns with those\nfound \u201cin some proof-theoretic studies\u201d, and citing\nDo\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1988). (In fact in the footnote,\nthough not in the bibliography, the date is given as 1998.) \n\nId-inductivity is called \u2018regularity\u2019 in Kaminski (1988);\nfor Id-inductivity and Cut-inductivity and related concepts (under\ndifferent names), see also Ciabattoni (2004) and Ciabattoni and Terui\n(2006).\n\nA study of Popper\u2019s generally under-appreciated work in logic is\nprovided in Schroeder-Heister (1984). The faulty view that differences\nover logic amount to talking at cross purposes was defended in\nwritings by W. V. Quine to which references may be found in Morton\n(1973), where this view is subjected to a somewhat milder version of\nthe criticism in Section\n 3.\n A full discussion of substructural logics, also mentioned in Section\n 3,\n and related topics is provided in Restall (2000).\n\nAside from the papers by Prior, Belnap, Stevenson and Peacocke (and\nRead 1988) mentioned in Section\n 3,\n the Tonk example is discussed in (at least)\nthe following places: Wagner (1981), Hart (1982), \u00a74.12 in\nTennant (1978). Interest continues unabated, as witnessed by the\nfollowing publications from the period 2004\u20132006 alone: Hodes\n(2004), Cook (2005), Tennant (2005), Bonnay and Simmenauer (2005),\nChapter 5 of Priest (2006) and Wansing (2006). Subsequent treatments\nof interest include Avron (2010) and Rahmann (2012). Although Tonk\nis Prior\u2019s best known example of\nnon-conservative extension, he also noted the non-conservative effect\nof familiar logical principles concerning conjunction when added to a\npurely implicational intermediate logic; references, details, and\nfurther discussion can be found in Humberstone (2014). For the notion\n\u2013 or perhaps better, notions \u2013 of harmony between\nrules (especially in natural deduction), see the Tonk\nreferences just given, and also Chapter 23 of\nTennant (1987), Weir (1986), Dummett (1991) (passim), Milne\n(1994) and (2002), and Read (2000), as well as the following more\nrecent investigations: Read (2010), Steinberger (2011), Francez and\nDyckhoff (2012), Hjortland (2012), Francez (2014), Milne (2015), Read\n(2015), Schroeder-Heister (2015) and Dicher (2016). For general background in\nproof-theoretic semantics informing these discussions, two useful\nreferences are Schroeder-Heister (2014) and the editor\u2019s\ncontribution (Chapter 1) to Wansing (2015). The subject of harmony is\nalso briefly touched on in Makinson (2014), esp. p.\u00a0369.\n\nMaterial of interest on the subjects of special and universally\nrepresentative connectives can be found in Jankov (1969), Pahi (1971),\nde Jongh and Chagrova (1995), in addition to the references cited in\nSection\n 3.\n For the fact that the relation of head linkage is special in\nintuitionistic logic, see Urquhart (1974) \u2014 not that this terminology appears there.\n\n",
