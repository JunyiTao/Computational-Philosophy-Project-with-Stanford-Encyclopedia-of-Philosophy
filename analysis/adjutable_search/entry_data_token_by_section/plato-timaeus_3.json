    "main_text": "The Status of the Account\n4. The Status of the Account\n\nIn his prefatory remarks Timaeus describes the account he is about to\ngive as a \u201clikely account\u201d (eik\u00f4s logos) or\n\u201clikely story\u201d (eik\u00f4s\n muthos).[8]\n The description is a play on words: the subject of the account is\nitself an \u201cimage\u201d (eik\u00f4n) and, Timaeus\navers, \u201cthe accounts we give of things [should] have the same\ncharacter as the subjects they set forth\u201d (29b3\u20135).\nFashioned after an unchanging and eternal model\u2014a possible\nsubject of a definitive and exact account\u2014the universe as a\nthing that becomes is shifting and unstable, and hence any account\ngiven of it will be similarly lacking in complete accuracy and\nconsistency (29c4\u20137). This may be read as lowering our\nexpectations\u2014the account is no more than likely. At the same\ntime, Timaeus says he will strive to give an account that is \u201cno\nless likely than anyone else\u2019s\u201d (or \u201cany other\n[account]\u201d) (29c7\u20138) and, while the account cannot be\ngrasped by understanding (nous, 29b6\u2014the faculty for\napprehending unchanging truths), it nevertheless merits our\n\u201cbelief\u201d (pistis, 29c3) and fulfills certain\nstandards. As Timaeus\u2019 account proceeds, we are frequently\nreminded of its \u201clikely\u201d\n character,[9]\n and both the negative and positive connotations of that\ncharacterization should be kept in mind.\n\nThe account, then, is presented as reasonable, thus meriting our\nbelief, but neither definitive nor complete (cf. 68b6\u20138), and\nthus open to possible revision (cf. 54b1\u20132, 55d4\u20136). A\ndefinitive account of these matters eludes humans (29d1) and is\navailable only to a god \u201cand those human beings dear to\nhim\u201d\n (53d4\u20137).[10]\n It has sometimes been argued that the qualification of the account as\n\u201cmerely likely\u201d supports a metaphorical reading of the\ncosmology. This, however, is a mistake; it is not easy to see how the\ndistinction between an exact and definitive versus a reliable but\nrevisable account maps on to the distinction between a literal versus\na metaphorical account. The contrast should rather be seen as one\nbetween apodeictic certainty (about intelligible matters) and\n plausibility[11]\n (about empirical matters). To the extent that the subject of the\naccount is a thing that becomes rather than a thing that is, as well\nas a thing that is perceptible rather than a thing that is\nintelligible, the account will be no more than likely. To the extent\nthat it is beautiful and ordered, modeled after a perfect reality and\nfashioned by a most excellent maker, the account will be no less than\nlikely.\n",
