    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Trust || Truth- vs. end-directed rationality\n2.1 Truth- vs. end-directed rationality\n\nIn discussing the rationality of trust, some authors distinguish\nbetween these two types of rationality (also referred to as epistemic\nvs. strategic rationality; see, e.g., Baker 1987). One could say that\nwe are rational in trusting emergency room physicians, for example,\nnot necessarily because we have good reason to believe that they are\ntrustworthy (our rationality is not truth-directed), but because by\ntrusting them, we can remain calm in a situation over which we have\nlittle control (our rationality is therefore end-directed). Similarly,\nit may be rational for me to trust my brother not because I have good\nevidence of his trustworthiness but rather because trusting him is\nessential to our having a loving\n relationship.[10]\n\nTrust can be rational, then, depending on whether one conceives of\nrationality as truth-directed or end-directed. Notice that it matters\nalso how one conceives of trust, and more specifically, whether one\nconceives of it as a belief in someone\u2019s trustworthiness (see\n section 4).\n If trust is a belief, then whether the rationality of trust can be\nend-directed will depend on whether the rationality of a belief can be\nend-directed. To put the point more generally, how trust is rationally\njustified will depend on how beliefs are rationally justified (Jones\n1996).\n\nSome of the literature on trust and rationality concerns whether the\nrationality of trust can indeed be end-directed and also what could\nmake therapeutic trust and the like rational. Pamela Hieronymi argues\nthat the ends for which we trust cannot provide reasons for us to\ntrust in the first place (2008). Considerations about how useful or\nvaluable trust is do not bear on the truth of a trusting belief (i.e.,\na belief in someone\u2019s trustworthiness). But Hieronymi claims\nthat trust, in a pure sense at least, always involves a trusting\nbelief. How then does she account for trust that is motivated by how\ntherapeutic (i.e., useful) the trust will be? She believes that trust\nof this sort is not pure or full-fledged trust. As she explains,\npeople can legitimately complain about not being trusted fully when\nthey are trusted in this way, which occurs when other people lack\nconfidence in them but trust them nonetheless (2008: 230; see also\nLahno 2001: 184\u2013185).\n\nBy contrast, Victoria McGeer believes that trust is more substantial\nor pure when the available evidence does not support it (2008). She\ndescribes how trust of this sort\u2014what she calls\n\u201csubstantial trust\u201d\u2014could be rational and does so\nwithout appealing to how important it might be or to the ends it might\nserve, but instead to whether the trustee will be\n trustworthy.[11]\n According to McGeer, what makes \u201csubstantial trust\u201d\nrational is that it involves hope that the trustees will do what they\nare trusted to do, which \u201ccan have a galvanizing effect on how\n[they] see themselves, as trustors avowedly do, in the fullness of\ntheir potential\u201d (2008: 252; see also McGeer and Pettit 2017).\nRather than complain (as Hieronymi would assume that trustees might)\nabout trustors being merely hopeful about their trustworthiness, they\ncould respond well to the trustors\u2019 attitude toward them.\nMoreover, if it is likely that they will respond well\u2014in other\nwords, that they will be trust-responsive\u2014then the trust in them\nmust be epistemically rational. That is particularly true if being\ntrustworthy involves being trust-responsive, as it does for McGeer\n(McGeer and Pettit 2017).\n\nMcGeer\u2019s work suggests that all trust\u2014even therapeutic\ntrust\u2014can be rational in a truth-directed way. As we\u2019ve\nseen, there is some dispute about whether trust can be rational in\njust an end-directed way. What matters here is whether trust is the\nsort of attitude whose rationality could be end-directed.\n",
