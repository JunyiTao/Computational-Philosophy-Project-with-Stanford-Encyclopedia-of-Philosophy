Contractarianism and Justice\n\nThe shortcomings of utilitarianism have prompted several recent\nphilosophers to revive the old idea of the social contract as a better\nway of bringing coherence to our thinking about justice. The idea here\nis not that people actually have entered a contract to establish\njustice, or that they should proceed to do so, but that we can\nunderstand justice better by asking the question: what principles to\ngovern their institutions, practices and personal behaviour would\npeople choose to adopt if they all had to agree on them in advance?\nThe contract, in other words, is hypothetical; but the search for\nagreement is meant to ensure that the principles chosen would, when\nimplemented, not lead to outcomes that people could not accept. Thus\nwhereas a utilitarian might, under some circumstances, be prepared to\nsupport slavery \u2013 if the misery of the slaves were outweighed by\nthe heightened pleasures of the slave-owners \u2013 contractarians\nclaims that no-one could accept a principle permitting slavery, lest\nthey themselves were destined to be slaves when the principle was\napplied.\n\nThe problem that contractarians face is to show how such an agreement\nis possible. If we were to ask people, in the real world, what\nprinciples they would prefer to live under, they are likely to start\nfrom a position of quite radical disagreement, given their interests\nand their beliefs. Some might even be willing to endorse slavery, if\nthey were fairly certain that they would not end up as slaves\nthemselves, or if they were sado-masochists who viewed the\nhumiliations inflicted on slaves in a positive light. So in order to\nshow how agreement could be achieved, contractarians have to model the\ncontracting parties in a particular way, either by limiting what they\nare allowed to know about themselves or about the future, or by\nattributing to them certain motivations while excluding others. Since\nthe modelling can be done differently, we have a family of\ncontractarian theories of justice, three of whose most important\nmembers are the theories of Gauthier, Rawls and Scanlon.\n",
