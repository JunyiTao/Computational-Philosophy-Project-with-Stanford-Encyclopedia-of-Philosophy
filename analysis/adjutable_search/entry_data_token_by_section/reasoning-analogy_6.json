    "main_text": "Criteria for evaluating analogical arguments || Aristotle\u2019s theory\n3.2 Aristotle\u2019s theory\n\nAristotle sets the stage for all later theories of analogical\nreasoning. In his theoretical reflections on analogy and in his most\njudicious examples, we find a sober account that lays the foundation\nboth for the commonsense guidelines noted above and for more\nsophisticated analyses.\n\nAlthough Aristotle employs the term analogy (analogia) and\ndiscusses\n analogical predication,\n he never talks about analogical reasoning or analogical arguments\nper se. He does, however, identify two argument forms, the\nargument from example (paradeigma) and the\nargument from likeness (homoiotes), both closely\nrelated to what would we now recognize as an analogical argument.\n\nThe argument from example (paradeigma) is described\nin the Rhetoric and the Prior Analytics:\n\n\nEnthymemes based upon example are those which proceed from one or more\nsimilar cases, arrive at a general proposition, and then argue\ndeductively to a particular inference. (Rhetoric 1402b15)\n\nLet \\(A\\) be evil, \\(B\\) making war against neighbours, \\(C\\)\nAthenians against Thebans, \\(D\\) Thebans against Phocians. If then we\nwish to prove that to fight with the Thebans is an evil, we must\nassume that to fight against neighbours is an evil. Conviction of this\nis obtained from similar cases, e.g., that the war against the\nPhocians was an evil to the Thebans. Since then to fight against\nneighbours is an evil, and to fight against the Thebans is to fight\nagainst neighbours, it is clear that to fight against the Thebans is\nan evil. (Pr. An. 69a1)\n\n\nAristotle notes two differences between this argument form and\ninduction (69a15ff.): it \u201cdoes not draw its proof from all the\nparticular cases\u201d (i.e., it is not a \u201ccomplete\u201d\ninduction), and it requires an additional (deductively valid)\nsyllogism as the final step. The argument from example thus amounts to\nsingle-case induction followed by deductive inference. It has the\nfollowing structure (using \\(\\supset\\) for the conditional):\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nIn the terminology of\n \u00a72.2,\n \\(P\\) is the positive analogy and \\(Q\\) is the hypothetical analogy.\nIn Aristotle\u2019s example, \\(S\\) (the source) is war between\nPhocians and Thebans, \\(T\\) (the target) is war between Athenians and\nThebans, \\(P\\) is war between neighbours, and \\(Q\\) is evil. The first\ninference (dashed arrow) is inductive; the second and third (solid\narrows) are deductively valid.\n\nThe paradeigma has an interesting feature: it is amenable to\nan alternative analysis as a purely deductive argument form.\nLet us concentrate on Aristotle\u2019s assertion, \u201cwe must\nassume that to fight against neighbours is an evil,\u201d represented\nas \\(\\forall x(P(x) \\supset Q(x))\\). Instead of regarding this\nintermediate step as something reached by induction from a single\ncase, we might instead regard it as a hidden presupposition. This\ntransforms the paradeigma into a syllogistic argument with a\nmissing or enthymematic premise, and our attention shifts to\npossible means for establishing that premise (with single-case\ninduction as one such means). Construed in this way, Aristotle\u2019s\nparadeigma argument foreshadows deductive analyses of\nanalogical reasoning (see\n \u00a74.1).\n\nThe argument from likeness (homoiotes) seems to be\ncloser than the paradeigma to our contemporary understanding\nof analogical arguments. This argument form receives considerable\nattention in Topics I, 17 and 18 and again in VIII, 1. The\nmost important passage is the following.\n\n\nTry to secure admissions by means of likeness; for such admissions are\nplausible, and the universal involved is less patent; e.g. that as\nknowledge and ignorance of contraries is the same, so too perception\nof contraries is the same; or vice versa, that since the perception is\nthe same, so is the knowledge also. This argument resembles induction,\nbut is not the same thing; for in induction it is the universal whose\nadmission is secured from the particulars, whereas in arguments from\nlikeness, what is secured is not the universal under which all the\nlike cases fall. (Topics 156b10\u201317)\n\n\nThis passage occurs in a work that offers advice for framing\ndialectical arguments when confronting a somewhat skeptical\ninterlocutor. In such situations, it is best not to make one\u2019s\nargument depend upon securing agreement about any universal\nproposition. The argument from likeness is thus clearly distinct from\nthe paradeigma, where the universal proposition plays an\nessential role as an intermediate step in the argument. The argument\nfrom likeness, though logically less straightforward than the\nparadeigma, is exactly the sort of analogical reasoning we\nwant when we are unsure about underlying generalizations.\n\nIn Topics I 17, Aristotle states that any shared attribute\ncontributes some degree of likeness. It is natural to ask when the\ndegree of likeness between two things is sufficiently great to warrant\ninferring a further likeness. In other words, when does the argument\nfrom likeness succeed? Aristotle does not answer explicitly, but a\nclue is provided by the way he justifies particular arguments from\nlikeness. As Lloyd (1966) has observed, Aristotle typically justifies\nsuch arguments by articulating a (sometimes vague) causal principle\nwhich governs the two phenomena being compared. For example, Aristotle\nexplains the saltiness of the sea, by analogy with the saltiness of\nsweat, as a kind of residual earthy stuff exuded in natural processes\nsuch as heating. The common principle is this:\n\n\nEverything that grows and is naturally generated always leaves a\nresidue, like that of things burnt, consisting in this sort of earth.\n(Mete 358a17)\n\n\nFrom this method of justification, we might conjecture that Aristotle\nbelieves that the important similarities are those that enter into\nsuch general causal principles.\n\nSummarizing, Aristotle\u2019s theory provides us with four important\nand influential criteria for the evaluation of analogical\narguments:\n\nThe strength of an analogy depends upon the number of\nsimilarities.\nSimilarity reduces to identical properties and\nrelations.\nGood analogies derive from underlying common causes or general\nlaws.\nA good analogical argument need not pre-suppose acquaintance\nwith the underlying universal (generalization).\n\n\nThese four principles form the core of a common-sense model\nfor evaluating analogical arguments (which is not to say that they are\ncorrect; indeed, the first three will shortly be called into\nquestion). The first, as we have seen, appears regularly in textbook\ndiscussions of analogy. The second is largely taken for granted, with\nimportant exceptions in computational models of analogy\n (\u00a73.4).\n Versions of the third are found in most sophisticated theories. The\nfinal point, which distinguishes the argument from likeness and the\nargument from example, is endorsed in many discussions of analogy\n(e.g., Quine and Ullian 1970).\n\nA slight generalization of Aristotle\u2019s first principle helps to\nprepare the way for discussion of later developments. As that\nprinciple suggests, Aristotle, in common with just about everyone else\nwho has written about analogical reasoning, organizes his analysis of\nthe argument form around overall similarity. In the terminology of\n section 2.2,\nhorizontal relationships drive the reasoning: the\ngreater the overall similarity of the two domains, the stronger the\nanalogical argument. Hume makes the same point, though stated\nnegatively, in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion:\n\n\nWherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases,\nyou diminish proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to\na very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error and\nuncertainty. (1779/1947: 144)\n\n\nMost theories of analogy agree with Aristotle and Hume on this general\npoint. Disagreement relates to the appropriate way of measuring\noverall similarity. Some theories assign greatest weight to\nmaterial analogy, which refers to shared, and typically\nobservable, features. Others give prominence to formal\nanalogy, emphasizing high-level structural correspondence. The\nnext two sub-sections discuss representative accounts that illustrate\nthese two approaches.\n",
