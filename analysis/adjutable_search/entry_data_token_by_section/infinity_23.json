    "main_text": "Decision || Infinitely many states: the St. Petersburg paradox\n7.2 Infinitely many states: the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nA fair coin is tossed. If it comes up heads, you receive $2. If it\ncomes up tails, the coin is tossed for a second time. If it then comes\nup heads, you receive $4. If it comes up tails, the coin is tossed for\na third time. If it then comes up heads, you receive $8. If it comes\nup tails, the coin is tossed for a fourth time. And so on. We continue\nuntil the coin comes up heads. If this takes n tosses, then you win\n$\\(2^n\\).\n\nHow much should you be prepared to pay to play this game? You have a\n1/2 chance of winning $2; and a 1/4 chance of winning $4; and a 1/8\nchance of winning $8; \u2026.; and a \\(1/2^n\\) chance of winning\n$\\(2^n\\); and \u2026 . Hence, your expected payoff from playing the\nSt. Petersburg game is infinite: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\frac{1}{2}\\times 2) &+ (\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4) + (\\frac{1}{8} \\times 8) + \\cdots + (\\frac{1}{2^n} \\times 2^n) + \\cdots \\\\\n &= 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf we identify dollars won with utilities, the game has infinite\nexpected utility.\n\nDecision theory seems to say that you should be prepared to pay any\nfinite amount to play this game. But most people think this is crazy;\nindeed, most would only pay a few dollars to play (Neugebauer 2010).\nAnd decision theory seems to say that you should be prepared to pay\nany finite amount for a ticket in any finite lottery whose payoff is a\nsingle play of this game. That may seem really crazy.\n\nYou might object that the utility of money decreases as you obtain\nmore of it: if the rate of this decrease is sufficiently large, then\nthe expected value of playing the game is finite. Daniel Bernoulli\nargued that utility goes by the logarithm of the amount of money, and\nindeed replacing the dollar amounts with their logarithms yields a\nfinite expected utility. However, we can retell the story in terms of\nutilities themselves. And we can retell it with super-exponential\nescalation of the value of the payoffs: taking logarithms then gives\nus exactly the original expected utility. (See Menger 1967/1934.) In\nfact, as long as utilities are unbounded, we can fashion a version of\nthe game that has infinite expected utility.\n\nSo you might object that the utilities are bounded. (See e.g., Hardin\n1982.) However, unbounded quantities abound\u2014length, volume,\nmass, curvature, temperature, and so on. Why is utility unlike them in\nthis regard? Moreover, one might imagine a case in which utilities are\nintimately linked to another such quantity\u2014e.g., the further\naway you get from some undesirable place, the better\u2014and an\nunbounded function might link them. Moreover, as we have noted,\nprobability theory is already shot through with infinitude; we need a\nprincipled reason why this kind of infinitude should be\nshunned. (See Nover and H\u00e1jek 2004 for further discussion.) And\nperhaps it is not crazy after all to value the St. Petersburg game\ninfinitely. After all, it dominates each truncation of the game, which\npays nothing if heads has not come up after \\(n\\) trials (for each\n\\(n\\)): the St. Petersburg game\u2019s outcome is equally good in\nfinitely many states, and strictly better in infinitely many.\nPlausibly, then, it should be preferred to all these truncations of\nthe game (H\u00e1jek and Nover 2006, 2008)\u2014its desirability is\ngreater than \\(n\\), for each \\(n\\).\n\nFor further discussion of the St. Petersburg game, see, for example:\nSamuelson (1977), Jeffrey (1983), Weirich (1984), Cowen and High\n(1988), Jordan (1994), Chalmers (2002), Peters (2011) and the entry on\n the St. Petersburg paradox.\n\nRelated but different problems arise in the Pasadena game, a\nSt. Petersburg-like game in which the expected payoff is apparently\nundefined (rather than infinite). Then, it seems that\ndecision theory goes silent regarding the value of the game. And yet\nvarious choices regarding the game seem to be rationally\nrequired\u2014e.g. preferring the game plus a $1 to the game itself.\nFor further discussion, see e.g. Nover and H\u00e1jek (2004),\nH\u00e1jek and Nover (2006, 2008), H\u00e1jek (2014), Easwaran\n(2008), Bartha (2016) and Colyvan and H\u00e1jek (2016).\n",
