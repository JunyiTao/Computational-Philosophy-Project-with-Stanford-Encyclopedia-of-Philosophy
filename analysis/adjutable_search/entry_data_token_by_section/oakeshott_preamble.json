    "main_text": "\n \nMichael Oakeshott (1901\u20131990) is often described as a\nconservative thinker. But this description notices only one aspect of\nhis thought and invites misunderstanding because of its\nambiguities. His ideas spring from a lifetime of reading in the\nhistory of European thought, sharpened by philosophical reflection on\nits arguments and presuppositions. Oakeshott worked on the premise\nthat philosophical questions are interconnected and that answering\nthem requires wide-ranging critical reflection. A recurrent theme in\nhis writings on moral and political life is the tension between\nindividuality, which implies plurality, and its denial, which he calls\nbarbarism. Individual freedom is threatened when politics is conceived\nas the pursuit of ideals. The recent interest of political\nphilosophers in the republican idea of freedom as independence or\nnondomination suggests the continuing relevance of his thought. So\ndoes their interest in political realism as an alternative to\nmoralism. But Oakeshott\u2019s contribution to philosophy is not\nlimited to political philosophy. It includes reflection on the\ncriteria for distinguishing different modes of thought from one\nanother, defining historical inquiry as one such mode, identifying\ndifferent conceptions of rationality and their place in practical\njudgment, and distinguishing competing understandings of the modern\nstate. Oakeshott also wrote on religion, morals, education,\naesthetics, Hobbes, and the history of political thought. Instead of\nsurveying all these topics, this entry will focus on his most\nimportant contributions to philosophy: his theory of modes, his\ncriticism of political rationalism, his argument that the key\ndistinction in modern politics concerns the character and purpose of\nthe state, and his philosophy of history.\n",
