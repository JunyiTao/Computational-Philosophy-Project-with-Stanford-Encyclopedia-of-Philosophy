    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || The eternity solution\n2.3 The eternity solution\n\nA third challenge to premise (1), independent of the first two, is\nthat it misrepresents God\u2019s relation to time. What is denied\naccording to this solution is not that God believes infallibly, and\nnot that God believes the content of proposition T, but that\nGod believed T yesterday. This solution probably\noriginated with the 6th century philosopher Boethius, who\nmaintained that God is not in time and has no temporal properties, so\nGod does not have beliefs at a time. It is therefore a mistake to say\nGod had beliefs yesterday, or has beliefs today, or will have beliefs\ntomorrow. It is also a mistake to say God had a belief on a certain\ndate, such as June 1, 2004. The way Boethius describes God\u2019s\ncognitive grasp of temporal reality, all temporal events are before\nthe mind of God at once. To say \u201cat once\u201d or\n\u201csimultaneously\u201d is to use a temporal metaphor, but\nBoethius is clear that it does not make sense to think of the whole of\ntemporal reality as being before God\u2019s mind in a single\ntemporal present. It is an atemporal present in which God has\na single complete grasp of all events in the entire span of time.\n\nAquinas adopted the Boethian solution as one of his ways out of\ntheological fatalism, using some of the same metaphors as Boethius.\nOne is the circle analogy, in which the way a timeless God is present\nto each and every moment of time is compared to the way in which the\ncenter of a circle is present to each and every point on its\ncircumference (SCG I, 66). In contemporary philosophy an\nimportant defense of the Boethian idea that God is timeless was given\nby Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann (1981), who applied it\nexplicitly to the foreknowledge dilemma (1991). Recently it has been\ndefended by Katherin Rogers (2007a, 2007b), Kevin Timpe (2007),\nMichael Rota (2010), Joseph Diekemper (2013), and Ciro De Florio\n(2015).\n\nMost objections to the timelessness solution to the dilemma of\nforeknowledge and freedom focus on the idea of timelessness itself,\narguing either that it does not make sense or that it is incompatible\nwith other properties of God that are religiously more compelling,\nsuch as personhood (e.g., Pike 1970, 121\u2013129; Wolterstorff 1975;\nSwinburne 1977, 221). Zagzebski has argued (1991, chap. 2 and 2011)\nthat the timelessness move does not avoid the problem of theological\nfatalism since an argument structurally parallel to the basic argument\ncan be formulated for timeless knowledge. If God is not in time, the\nkey issue would not be the necessity of the past, but the necessity of\nthe timeless realm. So the first three steps of the argument would be\nreformulated as follows:\n\n(1t) God timelessly\nknows T.\n(2t) If E is\nin the timeless realm, then it is now-necessary that\nE.\n(3t) It is\nnow-necessary that T.\n\n\nPerhaps it is inappropriate to say that timeless events such as\nGod\u2019s timeless knowing are now-necessary, yet we have\nno more reason to think we can do anything about God\u2019s timeless\nknowing than about God\u2019s past knowing. The timeless realm is as\nmuch out of our reach as the past. So the point of (3t) is that we\ncannot now do anything about the fact that God timelessly knows\nT. The rest of the steps in the timeless dilemma argument are\nparallel to the basic argument. Step (5t) says that if there is\nnothing we can do about a timeless state, there is nothing we can do\nabout what such a state entails. It follows that we cannot do anything\nabout the future.\n\nThe Boethian solution does not solve the problem of theological\nfatalism by itself, but since the nature of the timeless realm is\nelusive, the intuition of the necessity of the timeless realm is\nprobably weaker than the intuition of the necessity of the past. The\nnecessity of the past is deeply embedded in our ordinary intuitions\nabout time; there are no ordinary intuitions about the realm of\ntimelessness. One possible way out of this problem is given by K.A.\nRogers, who argues (2007a, 2007b) that the eternal realm is like the\npresent rather than the past, and so it does not have the necessity we\nattribute to the past.\n\nIf God\u2019s timeless knowledge doesn\u2019t threaten free will,\nthere\u2019s still the question whether it can be confined to the\ntimeless realm; if not, it might still cause trouble for free will.\nVan Inwagen (2008) argues against the Boethian solution on the grounds\nthat a timeless deity could still bring about the existence in time of\na \u201cFreedom-denying Prophetic Object,\u201d for example, a stone\nslab on which are inscribed the words, \u201cPeter van Inwagen will\nanswer the phone at 9:00 am on May 27, 2034.\u201d An interesting\npuzzle for Christian defenders of the Boethian solution is the problem\nof whether the knowledge of Jesus Christ during his time on earth was\ninfallible. The problem here is that the incarnate Christ was in time\neven if God is timeless. A particular problem discussed by Timothy\nPawl (2014a, 2014b) is whether Christ had infallible foreknowledge of\nhis own future choices, and if so, whether his created will was free.\nPawl defends the compatibility of Christ\u2019s infallible\nforeknowledge and the freedom of his created will.\n",
