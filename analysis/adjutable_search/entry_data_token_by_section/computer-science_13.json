    "main_text": "Programs || Programs as Technical Artifacts\n4.2 Programs as Technical Artifacts\n\nPrograms can be understood as technical artifacts because programming\nlanguages are defined, as any other artifact, on the basis of both\nfunctional and structural properties (Turner 2014, 2018 ch. 5).\nFunctional properties of (high level) programming languages are\nprovided by the semantics associated with each syntactic construct of\nthe language. Turner (2014) points out that programming languages can\nindeed be understood as axiomatic theories only when their functional\nlevel is isolated. Structural properties, on the other hand, are\nspecified in terms of the implementation of the language, but not\nidentified with physical components of computing machines: given a\nsyntactic construct of the language with an associated functional\ndescription, its structural property is determined by the physical\noperations that a machine performs to implement an instruction for the\nconstruct at hand. For instance, the assignment construct \\(x := E\\)\nis to be linked to the physical computation of the value of expression\n\\(E\\) and to the placement of the value of \\(E\\) in the physical\nlocation \\(x\\).\n\nAnother requirement for a programming language to be considered a\ntechnical artifact is that it has to be endowed with a semantics\nproviding correctness criteria for the language implementation. The\nprogrammer attests to functional and structural properties of a\nprogram by taking the semantics to have correctness jurisdiction over\nthe program.\n",
