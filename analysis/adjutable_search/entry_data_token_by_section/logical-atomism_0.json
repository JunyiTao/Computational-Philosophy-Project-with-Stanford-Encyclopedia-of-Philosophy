    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nBertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) introduced the phrase\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy in 1911\n(RA, 94), and used the phrase consistently throughout the\n1910s and 1920s (OKEW, 12;\nSMP, 84; PLA, 178; LA, 323; OOP,\n259).  Russell\u2019s logical atomism is perhaps best described as partly a\nmethodological viewpoint, and partly a metaphysical theory. \n\n \nMethodologically, logical atomism can be seen as endorsement of\nanalysis, understood as a two-step process in which one\nattempts to identify, for a given domain of inquiry, set of beliefs or\nscientific theory, the minimum and most basic concepts and vocabulary\nin which the other concepts and vocabulary of that domain can be\ndefined or recast, and the most general and basic principles from\nwhich the remainder of the truths of the domain can be derived or\nreconstructed. \n\n \nMetaphysically, logical atomism is the view that the world consists in\na plurality of independent and discrete entities, which by coming\ntogether form facts.  According to Russell, a fact is a kind of\ncomplex, and depends for its existence on the simpler entities making\nit up. The simplest sort of complex, an atomic fact, was\nthought to consist either of a single individual exhibiting a simple\nquality, or of multiple individuals standing in a simple\nrelation. \n\n The methodological and metaphysical elements of logical atomism come\ntogether in postulating the theoretical, if not the practical,\nrealizability of a fully analyzed language, in which all truths could\nin principle be expressed in a perspicuous manner. Such a \u201clogically\nideal language\u201d, as Russell at times called it, would, besides logical\nconstants, consist only of words representing the constituents of\natomic facts. In such a language, the simplest sort of complete\nsentence would be what Russell called an \u201catomic proposition\u201d,\ncontaining a single predicate or verb representing a quality or\nrelation along with the appropriate number of proper names, each\nrepresenting an individual. The truth or falsity of an atomic\nproposition would depend entirely on a corresponding atomic fact. The\nother sentences of such a language would be derived either by\ncombining atomic propositions using truth-functional connectives,\nyielding molecular propositions, or by replacing constituents\nof a simpler proposition by variables, and prefixing a universal or\nexistential quantifier, resulting in general and\nexistential propositions. According to the stronger form of\nlogical atomism Russell at times adopted, he held that in such a\nlanguage, \u201c[g]iven all true atomic propositions, together with the\nfact that they are all, every other true proposition can theoretically\nbe deduced by logical methods\u201d (PM2, xv; cf. OKEW,\n50). This puts the truth or falsity of atomic propositions at the core\nof Russell\u2019s theory of truth, and hence, puts atomic facts at the\ncenter of Russell\u2019s metaphysics.\n\nRussell also at times suggests that analysis demonstrates that what we take to be essential or necessary properties of things and relations between things are the result of the logical forms the these things, properties and relations are logically constructed to have. This suggests that there are no such connections between simple entities, that all atomic propositions are independent of each other, and that all forms of necessity reduce to (formal) logical necessity. Some commentators interpret these theses to be central to Russell\u2019s logical atomism, though explicit commitment to them is scant in his writings.\n\n\n \nIn what follows, various aspects of Russell\u2019s logical atomism are\ndiscussed in greater detail. The next section discusses the origins of\nlogical atomism in the break made by Russell and G.E. Moore from the\ntradition of British Idealism, and its development during the years in\nwhich Russell worked on Principia Mathematica. In section 3,\nwe examine Russell\u2019s notion of analysis as a philosophical method, and\ngive various examples of analysis as Russell understood it. In section\n4, we turn to a more detailed look at certain metaphysical aspects of\nRussell\u2019s atomism, and in particular, the nature and classification of\nfacts, as well certain points of controversy regarding his views. In\nparticular, we\u2019ll examine whether or not Russell\u2019s logical\natomism necessarily presupposes a fundamental realm of ultimate\nsimples, and whether or not the atomic propositions of Russell\u2019s\natomism were understood as logically independent. The final section is\ndedicated to a discussion of the influence and reception of Russell\u2019s\nlogical atomism within the subsequent philosophical tradition.\n",
