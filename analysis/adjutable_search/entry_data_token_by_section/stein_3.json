    "main_text": "Early Phenomenology || Other Minds, Empathy and Social Cognition\n2.3 Other Minds, Empathy and Social Cognition\n\nStein is best known for her work on empathy, understood broadly as the\napprehension of other subjects. Her contemporaries, such as Scheler or\nWalther, repeatedly refer to her dissertation (1917). Today, too, it\nis her notion of empathy that is increasingly discussed and viewed as\none the most nuanced phenomenological accounts, on a par with\nHusserl\u2019s and Scheler\u2019s analyses.\n\nMost generally defined, empathy, for Stein, is the basic form in which\nother embodied, experiencing subjects are given to us. Empathy is not\nmerely an epistemological tool for accessing other subjects or merely\nregistering their existence as minded beings; rather, empathy is\nitself a distinctive intentional experience. Whereas much of the\nepistemological debate of the knowledge of other minds is precisely\nbased on the mootness of the question of whether there are other minds\nor how our knowledge of their existence and their content can be\njustified, Stein observes that any debate revolving around the nature\nof empathy rests on the tacit assumption that other minds (but not\nmerely as \u201cminds\u201d) are indeed experientially given to us\n(1917:11\u201313[3\u20135]).\n\nStein conceives of such empathetic acts as a sui generis type\nof intentional experience directed at the experiential life of other\npersons. Empathic acts are sui generis; they are neither\ncomposed of nor reducible to other types of intentional acts (Stein\n1917: 16\u201320[8\u201311]). They are also distinctive in the way\nthey present their object and content: even though the intentional\nexperiences of the other are not first-personally \u201clived\nthrough\u201d in empathy (or, in phenomenological jargon,\n\u201coriginarily\u201d (origin\u00e4r) or\n\u201cprimordially\u201d given to the empathizer), empathic acts are\nexperienced first-personally. In that sense, empathy is an\noriginary intentional act, however, it presents non-originary\n(nicht origin\u00e4r) contents (1917: 15\u201316[7\u20138];\n51[34]). And yet, the non-originary contents given to me are\nnot non-originary simpliciter, but rather the originary\ncontents of another subject (1917: 24[14]; 28[17]). It is\ndue to this peculiar nature of intentional presentation of\nanother\u2019s experiences that empathy always preserves a self-other\ndifferentiation, and, indeed, involves an awareness of such on the\npart of the empathizing subject (1917: 27\u201329[16\u201318]).\n\nImportantly, the fact that empathy is a sui generis form of\nintentional experience doesn\u2019t preclude it having a\nmulti-layered structure, sharing characteristic features with other\nintentional acts (notably, perception, imagination, memory, and even\nanticipation of own future experiences), amounting to more complex\nforms of interpersonal understanding. Quite the contrary: One of the\nchief merits of Stein\u2019s account is that she offers a\nmulti-dimensional account of empathy that doesn\u2019t stop short at\ndescribing empathy as \n\n\nthe experience of foreign consciousness in general, irrespective of\nthe kind of the experiencing subject or of the subject whose\nconsciousness is experienced. (1917: 20[11])\n\n\nSpecifically, Stein argues for the following three claims: \n\n there is a basic form of empathy that shares key features with\nordinary (outer-)perception without being reducible to it; \n our empathetic experience is not limited to its basic form but\nincludes more complex forms of empathetic understanding; \n empathy must be markedly distinguished from further types of\nother-directed acts, such \u201cfellow feeling\u201d or\n\u201cfeeling-with\u201d (Mitf\u00fchlen) (as in \u201cI\nfeel your grief\u201d) or sympathy (\u201cI feel with your\nloss\u201d) and compassion, as well as from imitation or mimicry,\nemotional contagion, affective unification or\n\u201cfeeling-one-with\u201d (Einsf\u00fchlen), and finally\nfrom forms of \u201cfeeling together\u201d or emotional sharing\n(Miteinanderf\u00fchlen) (\u201cWe grieve for our\nloss\u201d). \n\n\nLet us briefly unpack these claims and point to some connections\nbetween them.\n\n(1) Basic empathy: Stein holds a nuanced version of what\ntoday is called the \u201cdirect perception\u201d account of social\ncognition According to this account, in typical interpersonal\nencounters, we can directly perceive that another is in a\nparticular mental, psychological or affective state (Dullstein\n2013; for some recent accounts, see Gallagher 2008; Smith 2010; Zahavi\n2011; Krueger 2012; Krueger & Overgaard 2012; Varga 2020).\nIn order to grasp, say, that my interlocutor is embarrassed, I do not\nneed to activate any cognitive processes other than perceptual ones.\nIn particular, I do not need to engage in complex inferential\nprocesses, explicit recollection drawing on one\u2019s own\nexperiences, or in any conscious imaginative perspective-taking or\nnon-conscious simulation process. Rather, I can directly\n\u201csee\u201d another\u2019s embarrassment in her blushing or her\nchange of voice. I thus grasp the other\u2019s experience in and\nthrough her communicative or bodily comportment, including her\ngestures, modulations in tonality of speech, or facial expression.\nStein restricts her analysis to those forms of comportment that the\nother enacts with a communicative intention and which express\nexperiences that she actually lives through and is aware of. However,\nStein suggests that it might also be possible to have an empathic\ngrasp of the other\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d by apprehending\nher \u201cwhole outer habitus, her manner of moving and her\nposture\u201d (see also below) (1917: 96[78]).\n\nNow, in the contemporary theory of mind debate on mindreading (Davies\n& Stone 1995a, 1995b), the direct perception account has been\npitched against the \u201ctheory theory of mind\u201d and\n\u201csimulation theory\u201d. According to the theory theory of\nmind, roughly, one infers another\u2019s mental life by attributing\nto her certain beliefs and desires on the basis of a\n(folk-psychological) \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (e.g., Baron-Cohen\n1995). According to simulation theory, to explain and predict\nother\u2019s behavior, social cognizers run certain simulation\nprocesses and create so-called \u201cpretend states\u201d (beliefs,\ndecisions, etc.) in their own representational working model (their\nown mind), and project this mental model onto the other\u2019s mind\n(Gordon 1995), or automatically \u201creplicate\u201d the\nother\u2019s behavioral expression and tendencies by innate\nmirror-neurons (Gallese & Goldman 1998). Some have also proposed\n\u201chybrid\u201d explanations, combining elements of the theory\ntheory of mind and simulation theory (e.g., Goldman 2006). As\ndefenders of the direct perception account have rightly pointed out,\nboth accounts rely on the general, and problematic,\nassumption that other minds are inherently opaque and not directly\nobservable; only if we assume such an unobservability thesis, do we\nneed to refer to either conceptual inferences or mental simulation (or\nboth) for mindreading (Gallagher 2008; Zahavi 2011).\n\nBut how exactly is, say, the distress of another subject\nperceptible or given in a bodily countenance? Stein analyzes\nthe precise nature of the relation between expression and what is\nexpressed (1917: 93\u2013103[75\u201384]) and concludes that it must\nnot be conceived as any sort of referential, symbolic, associative or\ninferential relation. Rather, what empathic perception directly grasps\nis the \u201cunity\u201d between the bodily expression of an\nexperience and the experience itself (a unity that is also given to,\nand indeed experienced as a unity, by the other). The underlying\nphenomenological claim is that the other\u2019s body is not given\npurely as a physical entity (K\u00f6rper), a meaningless\n\u201ccontainer\u201d of experiential items, but as a lived body\n(Leib), as the visible field of always already\nexpressive phenomena. Accordingly, the distress is\n\u201cco-given\u201d in the distressed countenance, and the two\n\u201cform a natural unity\u201d (1917: 95[77]). The unobservability\nthesis only follows if we assume that the only directly visible\nproperties of another person are the meaningless physical events that\nthe body is displaying. Once we appreciate that we are directly\ngrasping the sense of another\u2019s expressive bodily behavior in\nempathy, the need to refer to conceptual inferences or simulation\nprocesses to penetrate some allegedly opaque bodily barriers loses its\nmotivation.\n\nIn endorsing the direct perception account, Stein aligns with most\nclassical phenomenologists such as Scheler (1913/26), Husserl (e.g.,\n1952, 1973) or Merleau-Ponty (1945). Like these authors, she rejects\nboth the core tenet of one of the most influential theories of empathy\nof her time, namely Lipps\u2019 theory of empathic mimicry or\nimitation, which can be viewed as a forerunner of the simulation theory, and\nalso of Lipps\u2019 opponents, the so-called \u201ctheory of\ninference by analogy\u201d account, that she attributes to John\nStuart Mill (1917: 41[26]).\n\nAccording to the theory of inference by analogy, we infer from the\nobservation of the correlation of our own experiences to our own\nphysical body and its modifications that another\u2019s bodily\nmodifications, expressions and behavioral output must be also\ncorrelated with (particular) experiences. In contrast, Stein again\nclaims that it would be phenomenologically \u201cabsurd\u201d to\ndescribe our encounter with others as if we first perceive mindless\nbodies. Rather, perception-like empathy acquaints us ab ovo\nwith embodied minds.\n\nStein\u2019s argument against simulationist accounts and Lipps\u2019\nproto-simulationist account is more complex (see Stueber 2006 and\nZahavi 2010). For Lipps, when perceptually faced with a bodily gesture\nor the countenance of another, the empathizer feels a tendency to\n(inwardly) imitate the bodily contortion, a sort of innate\n\u201cinner imitation\u201d (Lipps 1903: 121; 1907: 718\u2013719;\n1909: 228). For Lipps, empathy, however, typically doesn\u2019t\nterminate in such mimicry. Rather, the automatically reproduced and\nprojected affect usually exerts an affective pull upon oneself, such\nthat one eventually comes to feel the other\u2019s emotion\n\u201cwith her\u201d. Lipps claims that empathic mimicry lies at the\norigin of the affective transference process and also that\n\u201cempathy directly involves a tendency to co-experience\n(Miterleben)\u201d (1907: 721). Moreover, he holds that in a\nproper act of empathy there is only one I given, namely the\nempathizer\u2019s own experience that she projects upon the\nother. Only after stepping out of the empathic stance, does the\nempathizer cease to be \u201cbound\u201d to the empathic target. She\nthen faces the other as an object, whereby a \u201cdivision\u201d of\nthe initially unique I (Teilung jenes einen Ich) and an\n\u201cawareness of a plurality of individuals\u201d ensues (Lipps\n1909: 231). Stein clearly rejects this view: For, if we actually were\nto \u201cput ourselves in the place (an die Stelle von) of\nthe foreign subject\u201d, by way of \u201csuppressing\u201d that\nthere is another I and only eventually ascribe our own surrogate\nexperience to the other, we would only have a \u201csurrogate of\nempathy\u201d (1917: 24[14]). Grasping another\u2019s experiences\nentails a clear self/other distinction, which cannot be established by\nthe projection of one\u2019s own (reproduced) affects onto another,\nbut precisely involves empathy as an other-directed act.\nRelatedly, a \u201ctaking over\u201d of foreign affects by emotional\ncontagion\u2014which may or may not lead to an affective unification\n(Einsf\u00fchlung) with the other (cf. Stueber 2006:\n8)\u2014rather than facilitating empathic understanding actually\n\u201cprevents our turning toward or submerging ourselves in the\nforeign experience, which is the attitude characteristic of\nempathy\u201d (1917: 36[23]; 1917: 35\u201336[22\u201324]).\n\n(2) Beyond basic empathy: For Stein, empathy is not limited\nto a direct-perceptual grasp of another\u2019s bodily comportment or\nexpression. Rather, a more detailed empathic explication involves a\nform of experiential reenactment of the other\u2019s experiencing and\na form of perspective-taking that is similar to, but not reducible to,\nimagination. Another\u2019s experiences have their own thick\nqualitative and motivational contents, which exert a certain\nmotivational \u201cpull\u201d on me, namely to\n\u201cexplicate\u201d them further, in order to properly\nunderstand them. \n\nStein conceives of the empathic encounter as a three-step-process. The\nempathizer need not run through all of them, and may repeat any of the\nsteps, depending on the situation or her interest in dwelling deeper\non the experiential life of the other. The process involves: \n\n the emergence or appearing of the other\u2019s experience\n(Auftauchen des Erlebnisses) in and through her bodily\ncomportment and expression; here, the experience is immediately given\nto the empathizer in direct perception but is still largely\nunspecified as to the other\u2019s further dispositions, motivations,\netc.; \n the empathizer may then bring this unspecified experience to an\nexplicative fulfillment (erf\u00fcllende Explikation);\nand,\n to a \u201csynthesizing objectification (zusammenfassende\nVergegenst\u00e4ndlichung) of the explicated experience\u201d\n(1917: 19[10]), which can then be reflected and dwelled upon. \n\n\nFirst, I encounter the other\u2019s sadness, apprehended directly in\nher posture, her facial expression or her tears, which are given to me\nperceptually; building on this apprehension, I eventually explicate\nthe experience, the mood, etc., that has led the other to experiencing\nthe sadness, and I myself experientially fill out the\nnecessary details; finally, the explicated experience is given to me\nas the experience of another subject, and thus \u201cfaces me\u201d\nas a proper intentional object (1917: 19[10], 51[34]).\n\nStein describes the second step \u201cas being at the foreign I and\nexplicating her experience by reliving it through\u201d (1917:\n51[34]). Importantly, as Stein maintains in her criticism of Lipps, we\nshould not understand this in a way that compromises the\nself/other-distinction presupposed in empathy and amounts to an\naffective unification or fusion with the other\n(Einsf\u00fchlung) (1917: 22\u201323[13\u201314];\n27\u201329[16\u201318]). In empathically reenacting another\u2019s\nexperiences, I am \u201c\u2018alongside\u2019 the other\u201d\n(\u201cbei\u201d ihm) but never \u201cone\nwith\u201d (eins mit) her (1917: 28[16]).\n\nHowever, Stein holds that proper empathetic comprehension of\nthe other\u2019s experiences requires a third step, and in\nthis regard her account is not altogether different from Lipps\u2019.\nFor it is only with the third step, the \u201csynthesizing\nobjectification\u201d, that the sadness of the other is again given\nto me as an intentional object properly speaking, and which I can\neventually reflect upon (1917: 51[34]).\n\nAn important issue that remains unaddressed by Stein is whether we\nshould interpret the explicative, objectifying and reflective steps\ntwo and/or three as some form of imagination or imaginative\nperspective-taking. Stein nowhere explicitly characterizes either of\nthe two as imagination (unlike Adam Smith, for instance); the only\nhint we have to this effect is that, in dismissing Scheler\u2019s\n(1913/1926) notion of empathy as \u201cinner perception\u201d\n(innere Wahrnehmung), she suggests rather to use, if at all,\n\u201cinner intuition\u201d (innere Anschauung), as this\nlatter notion would capture the non-originality of foreign experiences\nas well as that of one\u2019s own recollected, anticipated and\nimagined experiences (1917: 51[34]). Presumably, Stein\nfollows Husserl who believes we may imaginatively fill out\nthe empathized experience but we do not necessarily have to do this\n(similar to the case of other \u201cempty intentions\u201d). (For\ndetailed analyses of this three-step process, see Dullstein 2013, Shum\n2012; Svenaeus 2016 and 2018; for an often ignored, but interesting\nalternative procedural description of the different steps of the\nempathic process of Stein, see Stein 1920/1924: 149\u2013175).\n\nWhat is, at any rate, beyond doubt is that none of the empathic steps\nentails simulation in Lipps\u2019 sense or in that of standard\ncontemporary simulationist accounts. (For a neo-Lippsian\nsimulation-theorist, however, that comes close to Stein\u2019s\naccount, see Stueber 2006; cf. Jardine 2015.)\n\nStein\u2019s multi-dimensional account attributes to empathy the\npower to grasp not only another\u2019s dispositions and motivations\nbut also the social context of a person\u2019s motivational nexus, as\nwell her personal character (1917: 132\u2013134[114\u2013116]; see Jardine 2015; Taipale 2015a,b; Jardine & Szanto 2017). What is\nmore, Stein argues that empathy\u2014precisely in cases when the\nother\u2019s experiential life is markedly different from one\u2019s\nown\u2014(epistemically) contributes to the \u201cconstitution of\none\u2019s own personhood\u201d (1917: 134[116]) and to one\u2019s\n\u201cself-evaluation\u201d. The reason is that \n\n\nwe not only learn to make ourselves into objects (\u2026) by empathy\nwith differently composed personal structures we become clear of what\nwe are not, what we are more of less than others. (1917: 134[116])\n\n\n(3) Distinguishing empathy: Stein not only rejects Lippsian\nsimulation theories but would also reject a neo-Lippsian understanding\nof empathy that has lately gained much currency, namely the view that\nempathy entails a form of affective sharing. According to a prominent\nversion of this account, empathy \n\n is itself an affective state and specifically one that involves,\namongst other features, \n a certain \u201cinterpersonal similarity\u201d, i.e., some\nrelevant similarity or isomorphism between the affective state of the\nsubject and that of the target of empathy, and \n a form of \u201ccare\u201d for the affective state of the\nother, which brings it closer to what is usually called sympathy\n(though it cannot be reduced to sympathy) \n\n\n(see Jacob 2011; De Vignemont & Jacob 2012; De Vignemont &\nSinger 2006).\n\nIndeed, we can find resources in Stein\u2019s work for developing, as\nSvenaeus (2018) suggests, a notion of \u201csensual\u201d and\n\u201cemotional\u201d empathy, and empathy, at least typically, has\nsome \u201csensual basis\u201d (cf. 1920/1924: 164\u2013165; 1917:\n108[92], 127[109]). And yet, there is nothing to suggest that we\nshould characterize Steinian empathy generally as a\n\u201cfeeling\u201d, even if one were to distinguish\n(non-intentional) feelings from (intentional) emotions, as Svenaeus,\nalbeit in different ways as Stein proposes (see\n sect. 2.2,\n Stein 1917: 117[98]). Rather, according to Stein, we need to properly\ndistinguish the sensual basis, the perceptual and more complex\ncognitive components of empathic understanding, as well as empathy\ngrasping another\u2019s emotions and empathy grasping, say,\nanother\u2019s motivations or doxastic attitudes.\n\nMoreover, Stein and her fellow phenomenologists are careful not to\nconflate empathy with other forms of interpersonal and collective\nengagements\u2014be they empathy-based (such as sympathy, collective\nintentionality, fellow-feeling or shared emotions) or not\nempathy-based, pre-intentional or subpersonal forms of\nintersubjectivity (such as mimicry or emotional contagion). Having\nsaid this, there are a number of points of agreement between Stein and\nthe emotional empathy account. In particular, three points should be\nborne in mind: \n\nStein would certainly not contradict the point raised by Svenaeus\nthat empathy of the emotional type facilitates sympathy. Yet, there is\nnothing to indicate in Stein that only affectively poised empathic\nstance towards the other (what Svenaeus (2018) calls \u201csensual\nempathy\u201d) or empathy with an emotion of the other (what he calls\n\u201cemotional empathy\u201d) will result in sympathetic\nfeeling-with. \nStein probably would also agree that \u201csharing\u201d the\nothers\u2019 emotional state, in the sense of affectively\nre-experiencing it, might enhance our understanding of the other.\nHowever, again, empathic understanding doesn\u2019t necessarily\nrequire such sharing. Moreover, to refer to (affectively)\nre-experiencing another\u2019s emotions as \u201csharing\u201d\nunduly deflates properly joint- or \u201cwe\u201d-forms of emotional\nsharing. This brings us to the final point, \nIt is certainly true that Stein acknowledges various forms of\n\u201cwe\u201d-intentionality, including experiential and emotional\nones (see\n sect. 2.4),\n and she also holds that the latter necessarily presuppose some form\nof empathy (see Zahavi 2014, 2015). But that just reiterates the point\nthat the two forms of relating to others are not identical.\n\n",
