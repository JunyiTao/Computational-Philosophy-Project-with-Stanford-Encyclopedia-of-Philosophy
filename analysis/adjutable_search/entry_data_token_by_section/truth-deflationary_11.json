    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Correspondence\n4.3 Correspondence\n\nIt is often said to be a platitude that true statements correspond to\nthe facts. The so-called \u201ccorrespondence theory of truth\u201d\nis built around this intuition and tries to explain the notion of\ntruth by appealing to the notions of correspondence and fact. But even\nif one does not build one\u2019s approach to truth around\nthis intuition, many philosophers regard it as a condition of adequacy\non any approach that it accommodate this correspondence intuition.\n\nIt is often claimed, however, that deflationism has trouble meeting\nthis adequacy condition. One way to bring out the problem here is by\nfocusing on a particular articulation of the correspondence intuition,\none favored by deflationists themselves (e.g., Horwich 1998a).\nAccording to this way of spelling it out, the intuition that a certain\nsentence or proposition \u201ccorresponds to the facts\u201d is the\nintuition that the sentence or proposition is true because of\nhow the world is; that is, the truth of the proposition is\nexplained by some fact, which is usually external to the\nproposition itself. We might express this by saying that someone who\nendorses the correspondence intuition so understood would endorse:\n\n(6)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true because snow\nis white.\n\n\nThe problem with (6) is that, when we combine it with deflationism\n\u2013 or at least with a necessary version of that approach \u2013\nwe can derive something that is plainly false. Anyone who assumes that\nthe instances of the equivalence schema are necessary would clearly be\ncommitted to the necessary truth of:\n\n(7)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true iff snow is white.\n\n\nAnd, since (7) is a necessary truth, under that assumption, it is very\nplausible to suppose that (6) and (7) together entail:\n\n(8)\nSnow is white because snow is white.\n\n\nBut (8) is clearly false. The reason is that the \u2018because\u2019\nin (6) and (8) is a causal or explanatory relation, and plausibly such\nrelations must obtain between distinct relata. But the relata in (8)\nare (obviously) not distinct. Hence, (8) is false, and this means that\nthe conjunction of (6) and (7) must be false, and that deflationism is\ninconsistent with the correspondence intuition. To borrow a phrase of\nMark Johnston\u2019s (1989) \u2013 who mounts a similar argument in\na different context \u2013 we might say that if deflationism is true,\nthen what seems to be a perfectly good explanation in (6) goes\nmissing; if deflationism is true, after all, then (6) is\nequivalent to (8), and (8) is not an explanation of anything.\n\nOne way a deflationist might attempt to respond to this objection is\nby providing a different articulation of the correspondence intuition.\nFor example, one might point out that the connection between the\nproposition that snow is white being true and snow\u2019s being white\nis not a contingent connection and suggest that this rules out (6) as\na successful articulation of the correspondence intuition. That\nintuition (one might continue) is more plausibly given voice by\n\n(6*)\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true because snow is white.\n\n\nHowever, when (6*) is conjoined with (7), one cannot derive the\nproblematic (8), and thus, one might think, the objection from\ncorrespondence might be avoided. Now, certainly this is a possible\nsuggestion; the problem with it, however, is that a deflationist who\nthinks that (6*) is true is most plausibly construed as holding a\nsententialist, rather than a propositionalist, version of\ndeflationism. A sententialist version of deflationism will supply a\nversion of (7), viz.:\n\n(7*)\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true iff snow is white.\n\n\nwhich, at least if it is interpreted as a necessary (or analytic)\ntruth, will conspire with (6*) to yield (8). And we are back where we\nstarted.\n\nAnother response would be to object that \u2018because\u2019 creates\nan opaque context \u2013 that is, the kind of context within\nwhich one cannot substitute co-referring expressions and preserve\ntruth. However, for this to work, \u2018because\u2019 must create an\nopaque context of the right kind. In general, we can distinguish two\nkinds of opaque context: intensional contexts, which allow\nthe substitution of necessarily co-referring expressions but not\ncontingently co-referring expressions; and\n hyperintensional\n contexts, which do not even allow the substitution of necessarily\nco-referring expressions. If the inference from (6) and (7) to (8) is\nto be successfully blocked, it is necessary that \u2018because\u2019\ncreates a hyperintensional context. A proponent of the correspondence\nobjection might try to argue that while \u2018because\u2019 creates\nan intensional context, it does not create a hyperintensional context.\nBut since a hyperintensional reading of \u2018because\u2019 has\nbecome standard fare, this approach remains open to a deflationist and\nis not an ad hoc fix.\n\nA final, and most radical, response would be to reject the\ncorrespondence intuition outright. This response is not as drastic as\nit sounds. In particular, deflationists do not have to say that\nsomeone who says \u2018the proposition that snow is white corresponds\nto the facts\u2019 is speaking falsely. Deflationists might do better\nby saying that such a person is simply using a picturesque or ornate\nway of saying that the proposition is true, where truth is understood\nin accordance with deflationism. Indeed, a deflationist can even agree\nthat, for certain rhetorical or conversational purposes, it might be\nmore effective to use talk of \u201ccorrespondence to the\nfacts\u201d. Nevertheless, it is important to see that this response\ndoes involve a burden, since it involves rejecting a condition of\nadequacy that many regard as binding.\n",
