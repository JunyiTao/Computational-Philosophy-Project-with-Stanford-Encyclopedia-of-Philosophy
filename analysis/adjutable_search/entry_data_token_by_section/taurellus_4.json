    "main_text": "The Problem of Substance Monism Revisited\n5. The Problem of Substance Monism Revisited\n\nTaurellus returns to the problem of substance monism in his extended\ncritical response to Cesalpino (see Muratori 2014; Blank 2015:\n194\u2013199). Taurellus makes clear that one of his main targets of\ncriticism is Cesalpino\u2019s conception of God. As Taurellus points\nout, in a crucial respect Cesalpino goes beyond Averroes: \n\n\nWhat [Averroes] said about the assisting intellect, Cesalpino extends\nto the souls of humans and of the other animals, and of the entire\nworld, for he asserts a single soul that exists by itself and is\nmultiplied according to the bodies of living beings. And through\nparticipating in it, the bodies are animated and substances. (AC: 25)\n\n\n\nTaurellus is clear that such a conception implies that God is not\nseparated from matter and also not an efficient cause of things;\nrather, God is understood as a constituent cause (AC: 25\u201326).\nWhat is more, Cesalpino\u2019s conception of God seems to imply\nsubstance monism not only with respect to all animate beings but also\nwith respect to the world as a whole.\n\nSubstance monism seems to be an implication of a combination of views\nheld by Cesalpino: (1) the view that the active intellect is a\nsubstance that is capable of self-reflection; (2) the view that the\nactive intellect \u201cperfects everything\u201d; and (3) the view\nthat the active intellect \u201cimplants into things a striving for\nperfection insofar as it is intellection\u201d (Cesalpino 1593: fol.\n35v). Thus, the substantiality of the active intellect is\ncharacterized as being due to its capability of self-reflection, and\nit is this specific activity that is understood as the origin of the\nactivity of natural things, not only of minds. Consequently, Cesalpino\nmaintains that the plurality of substances cannot be based on\nconsiderations concerning human self-reflection. His argument invokes\nthe possibility of a temporary split in the self-consciousness of the\nactive intellect\u2014the possibility that during the life-time of a\nliving being the part of the active intellect that animates this\nliving being undergoes a stream of acts of self-reflection that are\nisolated from the stream of acts of self-reflection that other parts\nof the active intellect undergo at the same time. If so, individual\nminds would be \u201cincluded in a unique intelligence as parts are\ncontained in a whole or as a smaller number is contained in a larger\nnumber\u201d (Cesalpino 1593: fol. 36r).\n\nOne of the most interesting criticisms that Taurellus levels against\nCesalpino concerns exactly this issue. As Taurellus argues, the claim\nthat reflexive acts are due to parts of the active intellect could be\nconstrued in two ways. The first way would be to understand the\nrelation between the activities of the parts of the active intellect\nand the activities of the active intellect as a whole as analogous to\nthe relation between the activities of the parts of a stone in motion\nand the activity of the whole stone in motion. Here, the activities of\nthe parts of the moving stone are of the same kind as the activities\nof the moving stone as a whole: self-motion with the same direction\nand speed. If this were the relevant analogy, Taurellus argues, the\nactivities of the parts of the active intellect would be of the same\nnature as the activities of the active intellect as a whole (AC:\n270\u2013271). Evidently, this is contrary to the assumption that\nCesalpino makes, namely, that one part of the active intellect does\nnot have reflexive access to the activities of any other part of the\nactive intellect.\n\nBy contrast, the second way of understanding the relation between the\nparts of the active intellect and the active intellect as a whole\nwould be to use the analogy of the relation between the parts of a\nclock and the clock as a whole. Here, we have in fact different kinds\nof activities. But, as Taurellus argues, the difference between the\nactivities of the parts of a clock is exactly what justifies regarding\nthese parts as separate entities of a different kind. Analogously,\nwhat speaks in favor of regarding human minds as separate substances\nis not just the fact that reflexive acts occur but also that the\ncontent of one series of reflexive acts is not accessible from the\nperspective of another series of reflexive acts (AC: 271). The\ncognitive inaccessibility of one series of reflexive acts from the\nperspective of another series of reflexive acts would thus be\ninexplicable when one assumes, as Cesalpino does, that these acts\nderive from a unique intelligence. This is why Taurellus believes that\nthe structure of reflexive acts speaks in favor of the existence of a\nplurality of active substances.\n",
