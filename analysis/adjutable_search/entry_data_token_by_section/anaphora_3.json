    "main_text": "Recent Theories of Problematic Anaphora || Discourse Representation Theory\n3.1 Discourse Representation Theory\n\nIn the early 1980s, Irene Heim (1982) and Hans Kamp (1981)\nindependently formulated very similar semantic theories that were in\npart designed to handle problematic anaphora, particularly donkey and\ndiscourse anaphora. The theories developed by Heim and Kamp have come\nto be known as Discourse Representation Theory or DRT (see entry on\n Discourse Representation Theory).[10]\n We shall not attempt to describe differences between the formulations\nof Heim and Kamp. Indeed, in our exposition we shall combine elements\nof the two theories. Readers interested in the differences between the\ntwo accounts should consult Heim (1982) and Kamp (1981) directly.\n\nWe believe it is fair to say that it was the development of DRT that\nmade the semantics of anaphora a central issue in philosophy of\nlanguage. One reason for this was the following bold statement by Kamp\n(1981):\n\n\nA theory of this form differs fundamentally from those familiar from\nthe truth-theoretical and model-theoretical literature, and thus a\nsubstantial argument will be wanted that such a radical departure from\nexisting frameworks is really necessary. The particular analysis\ncarried out in the main part of this paper should be seen as a first\nattempt to provide such an argument. The analysis deals with only a\nsmall number of linguistic problems, but careful reflection upon just\nthose problems already reveals, I suggest, that a major revision of\nsemantic theory is called for. (Kamp 1981: 278) \n\n\nThe problems that Kamp goes on to address are the treatment of donkey\nanaphora and simple discourse anaphora. Hence Kamp appears to be\nsaying that these problems cannot be handled within more traditional\nframeworks and thus that a DRT approach is necessary. Obviously, the\nclaim that the semantics of anaphora requires a radical revision in\nsemantic theory got the attention of philosophers of language. Thus,\nthe study of problematic anaphora blossomed during the 1980s and\n1990s.\n\nThe first way in which DRT departs from more traditional approaches is\nthat it claims that indefinite noun phrases such as \u201can\nanthropologist\u201d or \u201ca donkey\u201d are essentially\npredicates with free variables rather than existential quantifiers.\nThus, the above indefinites might as well look as follows at the level\nof \u201clogical form\u201d:\n\n\nanthropologist(x)\n\ndonkey(x)\n\n\nIn effect, an indefinite introduces a \u201cnovel\u201d variable,\n(i.e., in DRT\u2019s terminology, establishes a discourse\nreferent) and a pronoun anaphoric on an indefinite is interpreted\nas the same variable as was introduced by its indefinite antecedent.\nHence a simple discourse such as:\n\n(27)\n A man\nloves Annie. He is rich.\n\n\nin effect can be represented\n as[11]\n\n(27a)\n man(x)\n\nx loves Annie\n\nx is rich\n\n\nIn addition to this, DRT builds in to the assignment of truth\nconditions default existential quantification over free variables.\nThus, (27a) is true iff there is some assignment to the variable\n\u201cx\u201d that is in the extension of \u201cman\u201d,\n\u201cloves Annie\u201d and \u201crich\u201d, that is, iff\nsomething is a man who loves Annie and is rich. Thus, that indefinites\nappear to have the force of existential quantifiers in cases like (27)\nis not because they are existential quantifiers but because of the\ndefault existential quantification of free variables.\n\nLet us turn now to the DRT treatment of donkey anaphora. First, note\nthat both relative clause and conditional donkey anaphora appear to\nhave a sort of \u201cuniversal force\u201d: the truth of\n (25)\n and\n (26)\n above, repeated here, require that Sarah beats every donkey she owns\nand that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she\n owns.[12]\n\n(25)\n If Sarah owns a\ndonkey, she beats it.\n(26)\n Every woman who owns a donkey beats it.\n\n\nThus, the indefinite here mysteriously has universal force and\nexpresses something about every donkey owned by someone. Recall that\naccording to DRT, an indefinite is effectively a one-place predicate\nwith a free variable. The central idea of DRT in the case of both\nconditional and relative clause donkey sentences is that the universal\nforce of the indefinite results from the variable in it being bound by\nan operator with genuine universal force. In the case of (25), the\n\u201cconditional operator\u201d has universal force, since it in\neffect says that in every case (assignment to free variables) in which\nthe antecedent is true, the consequent is true. So (25) claims that\nevery assignment to \u201cx\u201d that makes \u201cSarah\nowns x\u201d and \u201cx is a donkey\u201d true, also\nmakes \u201cSarah beats x\u201d true. So (25) is true iff\nSarah beats every donkey she owns. In (26), by contrast, the universal\nquantifier (determiner) \u201cevery\u201d not only binds the\nvariables associated with the predicative material \u201cwoman who\nowns a donkey\u201d (for example, presumably there is such a variable\nin the subject argument place of \u201cbeats\u201d), but it also\nbinds the variable introduced by the predicate-with-free-variable\n\u201ca donkey\u201d. So it is as though (26) has the \u201clogical\n form\u201d.[13]\n\n(26a)\n Every\nx,y (woman(x) & donkey(y) &\nx owns y) (x beats y)\n\n\nNote that this account requires allowing quantificational determiners\n(\u201cevery\u201d) to bind multiple variables. This, again, is a\ndeparture from more classical\n approaches.[14]\n\nNow since the DRT approach claims that indefinites get their apparent\nquantificational force from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem, it predicts that when different determiners are involved in\nrelative clause donkey sentences, as in\n\n(28)\n Most\nwomen who own a donkey beat it.\n\n\nthe indefinite should appear to have the quantificational force of the\nnew determiner (\u201cMost\u201d). So (16) should be true if most\npairs of women and donkeys they own are such that the women beat the\ndonkeys. Similar remarks apply to conditionals containing\n\u201cnon-universal\u201d quantifiers such as \u201cusually\u201d,\nas in\n\n(29)\n Usually,\nif a woman owns a donkey, she beats it.\n\n\nThis should be true if most pairs of women and donkeys they own are\nsuch that the women beat the donkeys. But this prediction,\nparticularly in the case of (28), seems clearly false. If there are\nexactly ten donkey owning women and one woman owns ten donkeys and\nbeats them all, while the nine other women own a donkey each and\ndon\u2019t beat them, (28) intuitively seems false: most donkey\nowning women fail to beat the donkeys they own. However, the DRT\naccount as formulated claims (28) is true in this situation. This\ndifficulty is one of the main criticisms of classical DRT in the\nliterature and is often called the proportion problem (Heim\n(1990) claims that Nirit Kadmon so dubbed it). The criticism is\ndamaging, because it appears to refute what was claimed to be a\ncentral insight of DRT: that the apparent quantificational force of\nindefinites comes from other elements that bind the variables in\nthem.\n\nA second difficulty with classical DRT as formulated here involves\ncases such as\n (18)\n above, repeated here:\n\n(18)\n A man broke into\nSarah\u2019s apartment. Scott believes he came in the\nwindow.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, (18) has a reading on which the second sentence of\nthe discourse attributes a general belief to Scott (something like the\nbelief that a man who broke into Sarah\u2019s apartment came in\nthrough the window). But as formulated, DRT doesn\u2019t get this\nreading. For the default existential quantification of free variables\nacts in effect like a wide scope existential quantifier over the\nentire discourse. Thus, it is as if (18) were as follows:\n\n\n(\u2203x)(x is a man & x broke into\nSarah\u2019s apartment & Scott believes x came in the\nwindow).\n\n\nBut this attributes a belief about a specific person to Scott. Hence\nit can\u2019t capture the reading mentioned. Similarly, consider the\nfollowing sentences:\n\n(30)\n Every\nwomen who has a secret admirer thinks he is stalking her.\n(31)\n If a woman has a secret admirer, usually she thinks he is\nstalking her\n\n\nThese sentences also appear to have readings on which they attribute\ngeneral or de dicto beliefs to the women in question. That\nis, they have readings on which they attribute to the women in\nquestion general beliefs to the effect that they are being\nstalked by secret admirers. This is why these sentences can be true\neven though the women in question don\u2019t know who their secret\nadmirers are, and so have no beliefs about particular persons\nstalking them. For reasons exactly similar to those given for the case\nof the analogous reading of the second sentence of\n (18),\n these readings can\u2019t be captured by DRT as formulated here. We\nshall see below that dynamic approaches have exactly similar problems.\nAsher (1987) and Kamp (1990) attempt to remedy this problem (among\nothers). For further elaboration of the DRT framework, see also Kamp\nand Reyle (1993) and van Eijck and Kamp (1997). For expansions of the\nDRT framework, e.g., SDRT (segmented discourse representation theory),\nsee Asher and Lascarides (2003), for compositional versions of DRT,\nsee Muskens (1996) and Brasoveanu (2006, 2007, 2008).\n",
