    "main_text": "Varieties of Contemporary Panpsychism || The Definition of Panpsychism\n2.1 The Definition of Panpsychism\nThe word \u201cpanpsychism\u201d literally means that everything has a mind. However, in contemporary debates it is generally understood as the view that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world. Thus, in conjunction with the widely held assumption (which will be reconsidered below) that fundamental things exist only at the micro-level, panpsychism entails that at least some kinds of micro-level entities have mentality, and that instances of those kinds are found in all things throughout the material universe. So whilst the panpsychist holds that mentality is distributed throughout the natural world\u2014in the sense that all material objects have parts with mental properties\u2014she needn\u2019t hold that literally everything has a mind, e.g., she needn\u2019t hold that a rock has mental properties (just that the rock\u2019s fundamental parts do).\nWe can distinguish various forms of panpsychism in terms of which aspect of mentality is taken to be fundamental and ubiquitous. Two important characteristics of human minds are thought and consciousness. In terms of these characteristics we can distinguish the following two possible forms of panpsychism:\n\nPanexperientialism\u2014the view that conscious experience is fundamental and ubiquitous\nPancognitivism\u2014the view that thought is fundamental and ubiquitous.\n\nAccording to the definition of consciousness that is dominant in contemporary analytic philosophy, something is conscious just in case there is something that it\u2019s like to be it; that is to say, if it has some kind of experience, no matter how basic.[7] Humans have incredibly rich and complex experience, horses less so, mice less so again. Standardly the panexperientialist holds that this diminishing of the complexity of experience continues down through plants, and through to the basic constituents of reality, perhaps electrons and quarks. If the notion of \u201chaving experience\u201d is flexible enough, then the view that an electron has experience\u2014of some extremely basic kind\u2014would seem to be coherent (of course we must distinguish the question of whether it is coherent from the question of whether it is plausible; the latter will depend on the strength of the arguments discussed below).\nThought, in contrast, is a much more sophisticated phenomenon, and many doubt that it is correct to ascribe it to non-human animals, never-mind fundamental particles. The traditional view in analytic philosophy is that thoughts are mental states that can be modelled as psychological attitudes towards specific propositions: believing that Budapest is the capital of Hungary, hoping that war is over, fearing that there will be another Global Financial Crisis. Panpsychism is often caricatured as the view that electrons have hopes and dreams, or that quarks suffer from existential angst. However, whilst there have been some defenders of pancognitivism in history, it is panexperientialist forms of panpsychism that are taken seriously in contemporary analytic philosophy.[8] From now on I will equate panpsychism with panexperientialism.\n",
