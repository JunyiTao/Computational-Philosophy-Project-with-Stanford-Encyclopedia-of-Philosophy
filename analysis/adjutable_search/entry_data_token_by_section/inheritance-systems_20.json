In general,\nepigenetic inheritance allows rapid response to inducing stimuli and\nmay be more advantageous than mutation/selection cycles in specific\ntypes of fluctuating environments. This may be particularly important\nin small populations and diploid organisms, in which mutations are\ntypically recessive (Nanney 1960). Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nargued that evolution typically moves from limited to unlimited\nsystems of inheritance or, to use their conceptual framework, from\nlimited to unlimited hereditary replicators, and from holistic to\nmodular replication (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995;\nSzathm\u00e1ry 2000, 2015). This evolutionary trend is manifested in\nthe major transitions in evolution to new levels of individuality (and\nnew kinds of inheritance) that they have characterized. However, the\nco-existence of multiple systems of inheritance and its evolutionary\nsignificance is downplayed by such an account. Jablonka and Lamb\n(Jablonka 1994; Jablonka & Lamb 2006), in contrast, emphasize the\nrole played by inheritance systems other than the genetic, in\nparticular by epigenetic inheritance, in evolutionary transitions.\nThey place particular importance on the role of epigenetic inheritance\nin the evolution of multi-cellularity (see also Maynard Smith 1990;\nNanney 1958, 1960; Shea et al. 2011) and in the evolution of the\nchromosome (Jablonka & Lamb 2006). Nanney (1960) suggested that\nepigenetic inheritance played a role in cell specialization in\nunicellular populations (colonies), which conferred economic benefits\nto individual cells and enabled populations to survive environmental\ntraumas due to their heterogeneity, prior to the emergence of true\nmulti-cellularity. In addition, Jablonka (Jablonka 2001: 113) argues\nthat with the evolution of repair and compensatory mechanisms\ninheritance systems become more limited. Two ways around the\nevolutionary stasis that would result are the move to higher levels of\nindividuality (Jablonka 1994), and the transition to coded\ninformation. Ruth Sager (1966) suggested it may be adaptive to use\ninheritance systems minimizing variability to control traits that are\ncrucial for survival.\n\nKim Sterelny (2001) presented a set of requirements that an\ninheritance system (\u201creplication system,\u201d in his words)\nshould meet if it is to support evolvability. Three fundamental\nproperties are necessary: (1) blocking outlaws; (2) stable\ntransmission of phenotypes; (3) generation of variation. Using these\nhigh-level desiderata, Sterelny articulates a series of nine\nconditions, called the Hoyle-conditions after Sterelny\u2019s thought\nexperiment: a vertical, i.e., \u201conly to offspring and from\nparents\u201d (C1), simultaneous (C2), and unbiased transmission (C3)\nof components (or replicators) that are irreversibly committed to\ntheir biological role as replicators (C4). Further, to ensure\nstability, replication has to be high-fidelity (C5), and the mapping\nbetween replicators and system organization (i.e, \u201cthe\ngenotype-phenotype map\u201d) has to be robust (C6). The requirement\nto support the generation of variation is cashed out in terms of being\nable to support a large, if not unlimited, set of variants or, in\nSterelny\u2019s framework, replicators (C7), having a\n\u201csmooth\u201d (quasi-continuous) mapping between replicators\nand system organization, i.e., small changes should result in small\neffects on organization (C8). Finally, the generation of biological\norganization from replicators should be modular (C9), in the sense\nthat each replicator or small group of replicators should be\nresponsible for only one or a few traits. Whether an inheritance\nsystem fulfills the Hoyle conditions is a matter of degree. Clearly,\nthe genetic system comes closest to meeting the full set of Hoyle\nconditions. Responding to Sterelny\u2019s arguments, Griesemer et al.\nargue that we should direct our attention to the evolution of\ninheritance systems (Griesemer et al. 2005). They note that the Hoyle\nconditions are a product of evolution, not a necessary precondition\nfor inheritance that can support evolvability. In addition, they point\nout that the Hoyle conditions may be met in a distributed\nmanner, that is by multiple inheritance systems each of which fails to\nmeet the criteria on its own but that together give rise to the\nrequired properties. Griesemer et al. also argue that the Hoyle\nconditions may conflict: satisfying one may limit the ability to\nsatisfy others.\n\nA significant aspect of the evolution of inheritance systems that is\nneglected by most contemporary accounts is the relationship between\nproperties of populations and fine-grained properties of inheritance\nsystems, in particular the relationship between the properties of\ninheritance systems and the mating strategies of species. The\nphenotypic variations produced by an inheritance system depend on\npopulation level considerations such as these which determine, in the\ngenetic case, the frequency of heterozygotes (and hence the\nsignificance of dominance and recessivity) and the probability that\ncalibrated gene networks will not be disrupted by sexual reproduction\n(e.g., because genes are adjacent on the chromosome or because the\nalleles are fixed in the relevant population). Population-level\nconsiderations also apply to the analysis of epigenetic variation and\ninheritance. For example, population size may affect the evolutionary\nconsequences of induced epigenetic variation (Rapp & Wendel 2005).\nPopulation level considerations are not typically addressed by\ncontemporary accounts of inheritance systems, yet clearly have\nevolutionary implications.\n\nThis issue was central to Cyril Darlington\u2019s analysis in his\n1939 book The Evolution of Genetic Systems (Darlington 1939).\nDarlington noted that the organization of the karyotype, or the\n\u201cgenetic system\u201d to use his terminology, and its dynamics\nthroughout the mating group, affect the hereditary combinations that\nare produced, and hence hereditary variation, and can lead to\nreproductive isolation and speciation. The following quote gives the\ngeneral flavor of Darlington\u2019s line of thought,\n\n\nThere must be a relationship between the hereditary materials, and\ntheir behaviour, throughout the whole group or species; and it is on\nthis relationship the genetic system depends for its\ncharacter. Hybridity optimum, segregation, and recombination must all\nbe related throughout the group. Furthermore, they must be related not\nmerely amongst themselves, but also to the mating habits of the\nindividuals which compose the group, and to the barriers which make\nthat group by separating or isolating it from others. (Darlington and\nMather 1949: 237; their italics).\n\n\nDarlington argued that the genetic system of a species is connected to\nits preference for inbreeding or outbreeding, since together they\naffect the frequency of heterozygosity (Darlington 1939; Darlington\n& Mather 1949). He noted that Mendelian inheritance establishes a\ncycle between free and potential (latent) genetic variability\n(Darlington & Mather 1949: 276): Potential variability is\ncontained by heterozygotes, while free variability is\nexhibited by the phenotypes of their offspring as a result of\nsegregation. \n",
