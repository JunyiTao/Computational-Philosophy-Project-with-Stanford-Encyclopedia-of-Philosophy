Some Criticisms of Interventionist Accounts\n\nA number of other criticisms besides the classic charges of\nanthropomorphism and circularity have been advanced against\ninterventionist accounts. One complaint is that interventionist\naccounts (at least as I have formulated them) appeal to\ncounterfactuals and that counterfactuals cannot be (as it is often\nput) \u201cbarely true\u201d: if a counterfactual is true, this must\nbe so in virtue of some \u201ctruth maker\u201d which is not itself\nmodal or counterfactual. Standard candidates for such truth makers are\nfundamental laws of nature or perhaps fundamental physical/chemical\nprocesses or mechanisms. Often the further suggestion is made that we\ncan then explain the notion of causation in terms of such truth makers\nrather than along interventionist lines\u2014for example, the notion\nof causation (as well as the truth conditions for counterfactuals)\nmight be explained in terms of laws (Hiddleston 2005). Thus appealing\nto interventionist counterfactuals is not necessary, once we take\naccount of the truth conditions of such counterfactuals.\n\nThese claims raise a number of issues that can be explored only\nbriefly. First, let us distinguish between providing an ordinary\nscientific explanation for why some counterfactual claim is true and\nproviding truth conditions (or identifying a truth maker) in the sense\ndescribed above, where these truth conditions are specified in\nnon-modal, non-counterfactual terms. The expectation that (i) whenever\nsome macro-level interventionist counterfactual is true, there will be\nsome more fundamental scientific explanation of why it is true seems\nplausible and well grounded in scientific practice. By contrast, the\nexpectation that (ii) for every true counterfactual there must be a\ntruth maker that can be characterized in non-modal, non-counterfactual\nterms is a metaphysical doctrine that requires some independent\nargument; it does not follow just from (i). Suppose that it is true\nthat\n\n(5) if\nsubjects with disease \\(D\\) were to be assigned treatment via an\nintervention with drug \\(G\\), they would be more likely to recover.\n\n\n\nThen it is very plausible that there will be some explanation, which\nmay or may not be known at present, that explains why\n (5)\n is true in terms of more fundamental biochemical mechanisms or\nphysical/chemical laws and various initial and boundary conditions.\nWhat is less obviously correct is the further idea that we can\nelucidate these underlying mechanisms/laws without appealing to\ncounterfactuals. It is this further idea that is appealed to when it\nis claimed that it must be possible to describe a truth maker for a\ncounterfactual like\n (5)\n that does not itself appeal to counterfactual or modal claims. The\ncorrectness of this idea is not guaranteed merely by the existence of\nan explanation in the ordinary sense for why\n (5)\n is true; instead it seems to depend on whether a reductivist account\nof laws, mechanisms, etc. in terms of non-modal primitives can be\ngiven\u2014a matter on which the jury is still\n out.[7]\n\nA different line of criticism has been advanced against\ninterventionist accounts in several recent papers by Nancy Cartwright\n(e.g., 2001, 2002). According to Cartwright such accounts are\n\u201coperationalist\u201d. Classical operationalism is often\ncriticized as singling out just one possible procedure for testing\nsome claim of interest and contending that the claim only makes sense\nor only has a truth value when that procedure can actually be carried\nout. Similarly, Cartwright complains that the interventionist account\n\u201coverlooks the possibility of devising other methods for\nmeasuring\u201d causal relationships and also suggests that the\naccount leads us to\n\n\nwithhold the concept [of cause] from situations that seem the same in\nall other aspects relevant to its application just because our test\ncannot be applied in those situations. (2002: 422)\n\n\nIf interventionism is formulated as above, this criticism seems\nmisplaced. The interventionist account does not hold that causal\nconcepts apply or make sense only when the appropriate interventions\ncan actually be carried out. Nor does it deny that there are other\nways of testing causal claims besides carrying out interventions.\nInstead, interventionism holds that causal claims apply or have truth\nvalues whenever the appropriate counterfactuals concerning what would\nhappen if interventions were to be performed have truth values. As\nexplained above, interventionists think that sometimes such\ncounterfactuals are true even if the interventions in question cannot\nactually be performed. Similarly, interventionists can readily agree\nthat causal claims may be tested and confirmed by, for example, purely\nobservational data, not involving interventions or\nmanipulations\u2014their view, though, is that what is confirmed in\nthis way is a claim about what would happen if certain interventions\nwere to be performed. In fact, thinking of causal claims in this way\nhelps to clarify why certain strategies for causal inference with\nobservational data, such as the use of instrumental variables, are\nmore likely to lead to reliable conclusions than alternatives\n(Woodward 2015).\n\nIn a related criticism, Cartwright contends that the interventionist\naccount is \u201cmonolithic\u201d: it takes just one of the criteria\ncommonly thought to be relevant to whether a relationship is\ncausal\u2014whether it is potentially exploitable for purposes of\nmanipulation\u2014and gives it a privileged or pre-eminent place,\nallowing it to trump other criteria (like spatio-temporal contiguity\nor transmission of energy-momentum), when it comes into conflict with\nthem. By contrast, Cartwright favors a \u201cpluralistic\u201d\naccount, according to which a variety of diverse criteria are relevant\nto whether a relationship is causal and which of these are most\nappropriate or important will depend on the causal claim at issue.\n\nThe interventionist account is indeed mono-criterial. Whether this\nfeature is objectionable depends on whether there are realistic cases\nin which (i) intervention-based criteria and criteria based on other\nconsiderations come into conflict and (ii) it is clear that\nthe causal judgments supported by these other criteria are more\ndefensible than those supported by interventionist criteria.\nCartwright does not present any uncontroversial cases of this kind. We\nhave seen that interventionist accounts and accounts that take, e.g.,\nspatio-temporal continuity to be crucial for causation do yield\nconflicting judgments in some realistic cases (e.g., those involving\ndouble prevention), but it is far from clear that the interventionist\naccount is mistaken in the judgments that it recommends about such\ncases.\n\nTwo still more recent criticisms directed against\n M1\u2013M4\n and possibility constrained notions of interventionism are Reutlinger\n2012 and Glynn 2013. These are discussed in the supplementary document\n Additional Recent Criticisms of the Interventionist Account.\n",
