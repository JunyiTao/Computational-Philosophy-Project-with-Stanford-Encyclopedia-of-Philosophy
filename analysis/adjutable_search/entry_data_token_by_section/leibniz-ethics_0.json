    "main_text": "Theory of the Good\n1. Theory of the Good\n\nLeibniz's ethics centers on a composite theory of the good. Three\nlongstanding philosophical doctrines compose the theory: (1) the\nPlatonic view that goodness is coextensive with reality or being, (2)\nthe perfectionist view that the highest good consists in the\ndevelopment and perfection of one's nature, and (3) the hedonist view\nthat the highest good is pleasure. This set of doctrines is disclosed\nin Leibniz's tripartite division of the good into the metaphysical\ngood, the moral good, and the physical good (T \u00a7209, p. 258). He\nequates the metaphysical good with reality, moral goodness with\nvirtue, and the physical good with pleasure. Moreover, with each type\nof good exists a correlative type of evil. The metaphysical good of\nreality correlates with the metaphysical evil of privation of reality\nor non-being. Similarly, the moral goodness of virtue relates to the\nmoral evil of sin or vice. Finally, the physical good of pleasure is\ncontrary to the physical evil of pain (T \u00a721, p. 136). The theory\nconstructed out of these divergent doctrines illustrates Leibniz's\neclectic approach to philosophical investigation. As he puts it in a\ncomment on his own system of philosophy, \u201cThis system appears to\nunite Plato with Democritus, Aristotle with Descartes, the Scholastics\nwith the moderns, theology and morality with reason. Apparently it\ntakes the best from all systems and then advances further than anyone\nhas yet done\u201d (NE, p. 71).\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBefore looking at the way he attempts to advance moral philosophy and\nthe theory of the good, it will help to have some background\nconcerning what Leibniz calls the metaphysical good and its\ncorrelative metaphysical evil. In uniting goodness with\nreality, Leibniz borrows, not without putting his own stamp on it, a\nview that had currency with certain medieval philosophers (e.g.,\nAugustine, Boethius, and Aquinas). The doctrine nonetheless originated\nin the Neoplatonic philosophy of Plotinus (204\u2013269) and Porphyry\n(234\u2013c.305), though there is clearly suggestion of it in Plato\n(e.g., Republic 518c, Timaeus 28b). In reuniting\ngoodness and reality, or to what he interchangeably refers to as\nperfection, Leibniz thus characteristically recovers and\nattempts to restore a doctrine that had currency among medieval\nthinkers (for a study of the medieval treatment of the doctrine of\nmetaphysical goodness, see the essays in MacDonald (ed.) 1991).\n\nReality (i.e., perfection) in Leibniz's view is not the sort of thing\nthat something either has or does not have. It is not an\nall-or-nothing matter. Rather, perfection is scalar\u2014it comes in\nvarying degrees. God has infinite perfection, the maximum amount,\nbecause He is limitless (PE, \u201cMonadology,\u201d \u00a741).\nEvery existent other than God, including the universe, possesses a\nlimited degree of perfection. \u201cFor,\u201d as Leibniz explains,\n\u201cGod could not give the creature all without making of it a God;\ntherefore there must needs be different degrees in the perfection of\nthings, and limitations also of every kind\u201d (T \u00a731, p.\n142). Because nothing but God is infinite, everything else exhibits\nmetaphysical perfection in varying, limited degrees.\n\nSince everything but God exhibits a finite level of perfection,\neverything but God also exhibits a degree of imperfection, some\nprivation of reality. Privation of reality necessarily belongs to\ncreation in the sense that it is logically impossible for a created\nthing to be unlimited (PE, \u201cPrinciples of Nature and Grace,\nBased on Reason,\u201d \u00a79; T \u00a720, p. 135). Only that whose\nexistence is absolutely necessary and therefore depends on nothing\nother than itself has infinite perfection. For Leibniz, metaphysical\nevil is the privation of reality inherent in the natures of created\nthings (T \u00a721, p. 136) (for further reading on Leibniz's\nconception of metaphysical evil, see Latzer 1994 and Antognazza\n2014).\n\nIn a letter in which he replies to an inquiry by the philosopher\nChristian Wolff (1679\u20131754) about the concept of perfection,\nLeibniz gives the following analysis:\n\nPerfection is the harmony of things, or the state where\neverything is worthy of being observed, that is, the state of\nagreement [consensus] or identity in variety; you can even\nsay that it is the degree of contemplatibility\n[considerabilitas] (PE, 18 May 1715, p. 233\u20134).\n\n\nThis indicates that there are in a sense two aspects of metaphysical\nperfection. First, metaphysical perfection is constituted by harmony,\nthat is, unity in variety. A situation is harmonious to the extent\nthat a variety of things are ordered in accordance with general laws\nor principles, such as laws of motion governing terrestrial and\ncelestial objects (PE, \u201cPrinciples of Nature and Grace, Based on\nReason,\u201d \u00a711). Second, that which possesses a degree of\nmetaphysical perfection in the sense of harmony can also be said to be\nworthy of observation to some extent. If there were nothing ordered in\naccordance with general laws, there would be nothing worthy of\nobservation because everything would be submerged in chaos. Thus\nharmony makes something contemplatible, like a painting by the Italian\nRenaissance artist Raphael (PW, \u201cCodex Iuris Gentium,\u201d p.\n171).\n\nLeibniz's ethics is therefore perfectionist in two distinct but\nrelated senses. On the one hand, the metaphysical good consists in the\nreality of a thing, its degree of metaphysical perfection, which is\nidentical to its harmony. This may be called metaphysical\nperfectionism. On the other hand, Leibniz maintains that moral\ngoodness involves the development and perfection of a characteristic\nor set of characteristics fundamental to human nature. Such a\ncharacteristic in a cultivated state is called a virtue. This is\nmoral perfectionism. For Leibniz, metaphysical perfection is\na necessary condition for moral perfection in that intellectual\napprehension of harmony gives rise to moral perfection.\n\nTo see how he arrives at this position, it is necessary to return to\nthe other two types of goodness: the moral good and the physical good.\n\u201cVirtue,\u201d according to Leibniz, \u201cis the habit of\nacting according to wisdom\u201d (PW, \u201cFelicity,\u201d\n\u00a71, p. 83). Yet one virtue in particular reigns supreme and\ncontains all the others, and that virtue is justice, which Leibniz\ndefines as the \u201ccharity of the wise man\u201d (PW, \u201cCodex\nIuris Gentium,\u201d p. 171; cf. PW, p. 57 & p. 83). One whose\nlove is guided by wisdom possesses the charity of the wise. Love is\nthe pleasure one takes in the happiness and perfection of others (PW,\n\u201cFelicity,\u201d \u00a75; NE, p. 163). God's wisdom is infinite\nand His love is universal, extending to all beings capable of\nhappiness. God's universal benevolence, Leibniz suggests, is an ideal\nwe ought to do our best to imitate and continuously aspire to (PW,\n\u201cMeditation on the Common Concept of Justice\u201d, pp.\n57\u20138; cf. PE, \u201cPrinciples of Nature and Grace, Based on\nReason,\u201d \u00a714, pp. 211\u201312). The more one's benevolence\nexpands to encompass the happiness of more and more others, the more\none grows in justice and virtue, thereby increasing in moral goodness\n(for further reading on Leibniz's view of justice as the charity of\nthe wise, see Riley 1996 (Chapter 4) and 2003).\n\nThe physical good thus bridges the moral good with the metaphysical\ngood. It links virtue and harmony because, for Leibniz, pleasure is\nthe perception or knowledge of perfection. Pain, on the other hand, is\nthe perception or knowledge of imperfection (NE, p. 194; PW,\n\u201cFelicity,\u201d \u00a74). A sensual pleasure, such as the\npleasure of listening to music or that of viewing a painting, is a\nconfused perception of perfection (i.e., a confused perception of\nharmony). In contrast, an intellectual pleasure, such as the pleasure\nof knowing the fundamental order of reality, is a distinct perception\nof perfection. Sensual pleasures in some cases approximate\nintellectual pleasures, but they inevitably fall short because they\ntend to be deceptive and transitory, whereas intellectual pleasures\nare pure and lasting, and true happiness, according to Leibniz, is\nsimply a lasting state of pleasure (PW, \u201cFelicity,\u201d\n\u00a73; NE, p. 194).\n\nDespite his identification of happiness with lasting pleasure,\nhowever, it is an oversimplification to characterize Leibniz's theory\nof the good as nothing more than a form of hedonism. Given that\npleasure is a confused or distinct apprehension of harmony, knowledge\nserves as the necessary means by which an individual cultivates the\nmoral good, the charity of the wise. Knowledge of the perfection of\nothers, of the perfection of the universe, and of God, the perfect\nbeing, is inherently pleasurable and concomitantly contributes to the\nproper order of one's character by generating love in conformity with\nwisdom.\n\nThe harmony of the universe then is a precondition for virtue and\nhappiness, but harmony alone is not sufficient. Knowledge is also\nnecessary. If there were no minds, or if there were no minds capable\nof knowledge, the universe would be devoid of virtue and happiness.\nThus knowledge unifies Leibniz's composite theory of the good. He\nsays,\n\n\u00a715. One must hold as certain that the more a mind desires to\nknow order, reason, the beauty of things which God has produced, and\nthe more he is moved to imitate this order in the things which God has\nleft to his direction, the happier he will be.\n\n\n\u00a716. It is most true, as a result, that one cannot know God\nwithout loving one's brother, that one cannot have wisdom without\nhaving charity (which is the real touchstone of virtue), and that one\neven advances one's own good in working for that of others\u2026.\n(PW, \u201cFelicity,\u201d p. 84)\n\n\nThe intellectualist cast of Leibniz's ethics stands out unmistakably\nin this passage. Knowledge of the order, rationality, and beauty of\ncreation is necessary for happiness. So too is actively imitating that\norder. Together, they are sufficient. Without knowledge, action and\nthe effort to promote the perfection of others do not necessarily meet\nwith success and may even backfire, leading to greater physical evil.\nWithout actively promoting rational order, knowledge alone does not\nlead to happiness. Leibniz's ethics no doubt has an intellectualist\ncharacter, but mere passive contemplation of the rational order of the\nuniverse is not the ideal of moral goodness. Instead, moral goodness\ncombines knowledge of the rational order with the active promotion of\nrational order as far as possible (for a discussion of Leibniz's view\nof the role of divine grace in the attainment of salvation, see\nRutherford 2014).\n",
