Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Reports of the fal\u00e2sifa\u2019s Teachings\n\nAfter having already made a name for himself as a competent author of\nlegal works, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee published around 1095 a number of\nbooks where he addresses the challenges posed by falsafa and\nby the theology of the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite Shiites. The\nmovement of falsafa (from Greek: philosoph\u00eda)\nresulted from the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific\nliterature into Arabic from the 8th to the early 10th centuries. The\nArabic philosophers (fal\u00e2sifa) were heirs to the\nlate-antique tradition of understanding the works of Aristotle in\nNeoplatonic terms. In philosophy the translators from Greek into\nArabic focused on the works of Aristotle and although some distinctly\nNeoplatonic texts were translated into Arabic\u2014most notably the\npseudo-Aristotelian Theology, a compilation from\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads\u2014the most significant\nNeoplatonic contributions reached the Arabs by way of commentaries on\nthe works of the Stagirite (Wisnovsky 2003, 15). Falsafa was\na movement where Christians, Muslims, and even pagan authors\nparticipated. After the 12th century it would also include Jewish\nauthors. For reasons that will become apparent, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\nfocused his comments on the Muslim fal\u00e2sifa. In the\nearly 10th century al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (d. 950) had developed\na systemic philosophy that challenged key convictions held by Muslim\ntheologians, most notably the creation of the world in time and the\noriginal character of the information God reveals to prophets.\nFollowing Aristotle, al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee taught that the world\nhas no beginning in the past and that the celestial spheres, for\ninstance, move from pre-eternity. Prophets and the revealed religions\nthey bring articulate the same insights that philosophers express in\ntheir teachings, yet the prophets use the method of symbolization to\nmake this wisdom more approachable for the ordinary people. Avicenna\ncontinued al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s approach and developed\nhis metaphysics and his prophetology to a point where it offers\ncomprehensive explanations of God\u2019s essence and His actions as\nwell as a psychology that gives a detailed account of how prophets\nreceive their knowledge and how they, for instance, perform miracles\nthat confirm their missions. Avicenna\u2019s philosophy offers\nphilosophical explanations of key Muslim tenets like God\u2019s unity\n(tawh\u00eed) and the central position of prophets among\nhumans.\n\nIn his autobiography al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes that during his\ntime at the Baghdad Niz\u00e2miyya he studied the works of the\nfal\u00e2sifa for two years before he wrote his\nIncoherence of the Philosophers in a third year\n(Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 18 = 2000b, 61). It is hardly credible,\nhowever, that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee began to occupy himself with\nfalsafa only after he became professor at the Niz\u00e2miyya\nin Baghdad. This account is apologetic and aims to reject the claim of\nsome of his critics that he had learned falsafa before his\nown religious education was complete. Most probably he had become\nacquainted with falsafa while studying with al-Juwayn\u00ee,\nwhose works already show an influence from Avicenna.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s response to Aristotelianism, the\nIncoherence of the Philosophers, is a masterwork of\nphilosophical literature and may have been decades in the making. It\nis accompanied by works where al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee provides faithful\nreports of the philosophers\u2019 teachings. Two of those works have\ncome down to us. The first is an almost complete fragment of a long\nbook where al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee copies or paraphrases passages from\nthe works of philosophers and combines them to a comprehensive report\nabout their teachings in metaphysics (Griffel 2006, al-Akiti 2009).\nThe fragment unfortunately bears no title. The second work, the\nDoctrines of the Philosophers (Maq\u00e2sid\nal-fal\u00e2sifa, on the translation of the title see Shihadeh\n2011, 90\u201392), is a loosely adapted Arabic translation of the\nparts on logics, metaphysics, and the natural sciences in\nAvicenna\u2019s Persian work Philosophy for\n\u2018Al\u00e2\u2019 al-Dawla (D\u00e2nishnamah-yi\nAl\u00e2\u2019\u00ee) (Janssens 1986). Previously it has been\nassumed that the Doctrines of the Philosophers was written as\na preparatory study to his major work, the Incoherence. This\ncan no longer be upheld. Both reports of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee stand\nonly in a very loose connection to the text of the Incoherence of\nthe Philosophers. The Incoherence and the\nDoctrines use different terminologies and the latter presents\nits material in ways that does not support the criticism in the\nIncoherence (Janssens 2003, 43\u201345). The Doctrines\nof the Philosophers may have been a text that was initially\nunconnected to the Incoherence or that was generated after\nthe composition of the latter. Only its introduction and its brief\nexplicit create a connection to the refutation in the\nIncoherence. These parts were almost certainly written (or\nadded) after the publication of the Incoherence (Janssens\n2003, 45; Griffel 2006, 9\u201310).\n\nThe Doctrines of the Philosophers was translated into Latin\nin the third quarter of the 12th century and into Hebrew first in 1292\nand at least another two times within the next fifty years. These\ntranslations enjoyed much more success than the Arabic original.\nWhereas in Arabic, numerous books that follow a similar goal of\npresenting (and soon also improving) Avicenna\u2019s philosophical\nsystem were composed during the 12th and 13th centuries, none of them\nwere translated into Latin and very few became available in Hebrew. In\nthe Latin as well as in the Hebrew traditions, translations of The\nDoctrines of the Philosophers overshadowed all of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s other writings. The Latin translation,\nsometimes referred to as Summa theoricae philosophiae or as\nLogica et philosophia Algazelis, was the only book by\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee translated during the period of the\ntransmission of Arabic philosophy to Christian Europe (the part on\nlogic is edited in Lohr 1965, the two remaining parts on metaphysics\nand the natural sciences in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1933). It was\ntranslated by Dominicus Gundisalivi (Gundissalinus, d. c.\n1190) of Toledo in collaboration with someone referred to as\n\u201cMagister Iohannes\u201d (d. 1215), also known as Iohannes\nHispanus (or Hispalensis), probably an Arabized Christian (a Mozarab),\nwho was dean at the cathedral of Toledo in the 1180s and 1190s\n(Burnett 1994). The two translators seem to have omitted the short\nintroduction and the explicit where the work is described as\nan uncommitted report of the fal\u00e2sifa\u2019s\nteachings. A small number of Latin manuscripts show signs that this\ntranslation was revised during the 13th century (Lohr 1965, 229) and\nin one case they preserve a Latin rendition of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s original introduction (edited in Salman\n1935, 125\u201327). That, however, had next to no influence on the\ntext\u2019s reception (Salman 1935), and the version that circulated\namong readers of Latin does not include al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\ndistancing statements (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1506). The book thus\nconcealed its character as a report of Avicenna\u2019s teachings and\nits author \u201cAlgazel\u201d was considered a faithful follower of\nAvicenna who had produced a masterful compendium of the latter\u2019s\nphilosophy. During the late 12th, the 13th, and the 14th centuries the\nSumma theoricae philosophiae was a principal source on the\nteachings of the Arabic philosophers in books by authors like Albert\nthe Great (d. 1280) and Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) that were essential\nto the development of the Latin philosophical tradition. The work was\nstill used sporadically in the 15h century and even more often in the\n16th century (Minnema 2014; Alonso 1958; d\u2019Alverny 1986).\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s identification as one of them is\nusually attributed to the limited knowledge of Latin scholars about\nmatters relating to the authors of the texts they read. The\nassumption, however, that the Doctrines of the Philosophers\nis not merely a report of the teachings of the fal\u00e2sifa\nbut rather represents al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s genuine positions\nin philosophy is not limited to the Latin tradition. There are Arabic\nmanuscripts that attribute a text that is quite similar to the\nDoctrines of the Philosophers to al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\nwithout mentioning that the teachings therein are an uncommitted\nreport. The oldest of these manuscripts was produced at the beginning\nof the 13th century at Maraghah, an important center of scholarship in\nNW Iran and is available in facsimile (Pourjavady 2002, 2\u201362).\nIt shows that also in the Arabic tradition, the positions reported in\nthe Doctrines of the Philosophy were closely associated with\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. The \u201cmis-identification\u201d of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee as a follower of Avicenna may have its roots in\nan attitude among some Arabic readers of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee who\nsaw in him a closer follower of the fal\u00e2sifa than the\nmainstream Arabic tradition wished to acknowledge.\n\nIn its several Hebrew versions, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\nDoctrines of the Philosophers (known as De\u2019\u00f4t\nha-f\u00eel\u00f4s\u00f4f\u00eem and Kavvan\u00f4t\nha-f\u00eel\u00f4s\u00f4f\u00eem) was one of the most\nwidespread philosophical texts studied among Jews in Europe\n(Steinschneider 1893, 1:296\u2013326; Harvey 2001). The translator of\nthe first Hebrew version of 1292, the Jewish Averroist Isaac Albalag,\nattached his own introduction and extensive notes to the text (Vajda\n1960). This and the other two Hebrew translations attracted a great\nnumber of commentators, including Moses Narboni (d. 1362), who was\nactive in southern France and Spain, and Moses Almosnino (d.\nc.1580) of Thessalonica (Steinschneider 1893,\n1:311\u201325). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Doctrines of the\nPhilosophers was a very popular text up to the 16th century and\nover 75 manuscripts of the Hebrew translations are extant (Eran 2007,\nHarvey 2015: 289). Some Jewish scholars, like the 14th century Katalan\nHasdai Crescas, saw in this Avicennan text a welcome alternative to\nthe equally widespread teachings of Averroes (Harvey and Harvey 2002;\nHarvey 2015: 300\u2013302). In fact, by the 15th century the Hebrew\nversion of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Doctrines of the\nPhilosophers may have replaced Averroes as the most popular\nsource among Jews for the study of the Aristotelian natural sciences\n(Harvey 2015: 289). Although the Hebrew translations make the\ncharacter of the work as a report clear, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\nwas\u2014as in the Latin tradition\u2014regarded as a much closer\nfollower of falsafa than in the mainstream Arabic tradition.\nThe Hebrew tradition, for instance, makes widely available the\ntranslation of a text ascribed to al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee where the\nauthor responds to questions about astronomy and cosmology that are\nquite far from Ash\u2019arism and much closer to Aristotelianism\n(Langermann 2011). This relatively widespread Hebrew text (edited and\ntranslated in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1896), referred to as\nTeshuv\u00f4t she\u2019al\u00f4t, \u201cAnswers to\nQuestions,\u201d or more recently as the \u201cHebrew\nAjwiba,\u201d exists in eleven Hebrew manuscripts (Harvey\n2015: 298). Its Arabic original is known only from a very small number\nof manuscripts, among them the one from Maraghah (Pourjavady 2002,\n63\u201399). Accounts saying that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee taught\nphilosophical positions he had openly condemned in his\nIncoherence were relatively widespread in Hebrew literature\n(Marx 1935, 410, 422\u201324). Moses Narboni, for instance, believed\nthat al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee used a stratagem to teach philosophy at a\ntime when it was, according to Narboni, officially prohibited. By\npretending to refute philosophy in his Incoherence he could\njustify the writing of the Doctrines. The Doctrines\nis therefore the main work on philosophy by al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee,\nNarboni suspected, while the Incoherence serves only the\nfunction of legitimizing the former\u2019s publication by saying that\na refutation must rely on a thorough knowledge of what is to be\nrefuted (Chertoff 1952, part 2, 6\u20137). This tendency among Hebrew\nauthors to disentangle al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee from the criticism of\nphilosophy expressed in his Incoherence led the Algerian\nJewish scholar Abraham Gavison (fl. 16th cent.) to report erroneously\nthat al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was the author of both The\nIncoherence of the Philosophers as well as its repudiation\nThe Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tah\u00e2fut\nal-tah\u00e2fut), a work in reality written by Averroes (Gavison\n1748, fol. 135a). In addition to his Doctrines, his\nIncoherence, which was translated in 1411, and the text known\nas Teshuv\u00f4t she\u2019al\u00f4t (whose ascription to\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee is doubtful), at least two other works by\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee were translated into Hebrew: Mishk\u00e2t\nal-anw\u00e2r and M\u00eez\u00e2n al-\u2019amal\n(Steinschneider 1893, 1:326\u201348, the text Moznei\nha-\u2019iyyun\u00eem mentioned there is not by\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee). \n",
