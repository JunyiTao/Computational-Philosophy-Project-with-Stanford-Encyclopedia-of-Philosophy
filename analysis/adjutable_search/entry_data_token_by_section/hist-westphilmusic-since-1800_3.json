    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Music and Drama: Wagner\n1.4 Music and Drama: Wagner\n\nRichard Wagner (1813\u20131883) is the most important major Western\ncomposer to have left a sizable body of philosophical writings on\nmusic. In addition to the intrinsic interest of his own views and\ntheir relation to the composer\u2019s musical production,\nWagner\u2019s place in the history of the philosophy of music is\nsecured by the influence Schopenhauer exercised on him, and by the one\nhe in turn had on another major philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche (see\n \u00a71.2\n and\n \u00a71.5).\n\nDespite the vast literature on Wagner\u2019s music, relatively few\nworks take seriously the philosophical details of his writings, and\nsome are openly dismissive of his undeniably meandering, rhetorically\ncharged prose (see for instance Fubini 1991: 325; significant works on\nWagner\u2019s philosophy and aesthetics are Grey 1995, Magee 2000,\nand Young 2014).\n\nWagner\u2019s first substantial theoretical contributions are the\nso-called Zurich writings (1849\u201352), from the name of the city\nwhere he spent his exile for having taken part in the 1848 revolution,\npolitical movements inspired by democratic and liberal ideals. In\nthese works, Wagner objects to the current state of art in society,\nand argues that only a new kind of artwork, a \u201ctotal\u201d\nartwork (Gesamtkunstwerk) uniting the various art forms,\ncould reestablish art\u2019s role as the \u201cliving utterance of a\nfree, self-conscious community\u201d (Wagner 1849a [1892: 41]).\nAccording to Wagner, contemporary art is enslaved to either political\nor financial power. It will become a genuine expression of the\ncommunity that produces it only after its liberation from the\nconstraints imposed by both the government and the market. Thus,\nWagner claims in Art and Revolution (1849) that art is not\nessentially revolutionary, although it need be revolutionary given the\ncurrent conditions, \u201cbecause its very existence is opposed to\nthe ruling spirit of the community\u201d (Wagner 1849a [1892:\n52]).\n\nWagner\u2019s paradigm of the total artwork is the Greek tragic\nfestival. While he does not call for its literal restoration, Wagner\nargues that the artwork of the future should be like the Greek one in\nsome crucial respects. It should involve all strata of society (Wagner\n1849a; Wagner 1852b: part II, 2). Most famously, it should unite the\nvarious art forms (Wagner 1849a; Wagner 1849b: IV). Aside from his\nreliance on the authority of the Greek model, at least two additional\nargument are advanced by Wagner in support of the\nGesamtkunstwerk. First, Wagner argues that its multi-sensory\nnature is best apt to give rise to an immersive, lifelike experience\n(Wagner 1852b: part II, 2; for discussion, see Young 2014:\n46\u201348). Second, Wagner holds that an art is unfree\n(unfrei) when in isolation, free when it cooperates with\nother art forms (Wagner 1849b: II, 2). The argument seems to rely on\nan analogy with human freedom, which Wagner conceived as possible only\nfor an individual who is part of a collective. In both cases, absence\nof limitations is equated with an absence of freedom.\n\nWagner\u2019s admiration for Greek tragedy is only superficially\nsimilar to the Camerata\u2019s attempt to revive it (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.2).\n In Opera and Drama (1852), he argues that opera\u2019s\nfundamental mistake has been that of subordinating opera\u2019s end\n(drama) to its means (music). He then describes opera as misguided\nfrom its very origins in Italy (Wagner 1852b: Introduction).\n\nIn 1854 Wagner encountered for the first time the work of Arthur\nSchopenhauer. This produced a decisive and immediate influence on\nWagner\u2019s worldview, which in turn had an impact on his musical\nproduction and theoretical works. Although Wagner\u2019s late\nwritings are less systematic than those of 1849\u201352, a new view\nof music and drama finds expression in his essay Beethoven\n(1870) and in The Destiny of Opera (1871).\n\nIn the Beethoven essay, Wagner describes Schopenhauer as the first\nphilosopher who gave a clear treatment of music\u2019s place among\nthe arts. Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy of music gives a privileged\nstatus to pure instrumental music (see\n \u00a71.2),\n an assumption that contrasts with Wagner\u2019s central commitment\nto a union of the arts, as well as with his related reservations about\nmusic alone. Under Schopenhauer\u2019s influence, the late Wagner\nsurrenders some central points of his earlier view, as evident from\nhis claim that \u201ca piece of music loses nothing of its character\neven when the most diverse texts are laid beneath it\u201d, and the\nsubsequent contention that the union of music and poetry always\nresults in the subordination of the latter (Wagner 1870 [1896: 104).\nThis stands in stark contrast with Wagner\u2019s earlier\ncharacterization of melody as an element that should not attract the\nlistener\u2019s attention, functioning merely as \u201cthe most\nexpressive vehicle for an emotion already plainly outlined in the\nwords\u201d (Wagner 1851 1852a: 372). Wagner denies a contradiction\nbetween his earlier and late views, although Young (2014:\n101\u2013107) notes that changes are evident both from Wagner\u2019s\nwritings as well as from the musical production that follows his\nencounter with Schopenhauer\u2014especially the three works in the\nRing cycle that follow Das Rheingold.\n",
