Historical and Contemporary Reception of Cooper\u2019s Philosophy\n\n\nHistorically, Anna Julia Cooper was directly and indirectly engaged in\ndebates about ideas related to race, gender, progress, leadership,\neducation, justice, and rights in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries with race men like Frederick Douglass,\nMartin Delany, Alexander Crummell, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Booker\nT. Washington as well as activist women such as Maria W. Stewart,\nSojourner Truth, Frances Harper, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church\nTerrell. These debates transpired not only through speeches and\nwritings (including public essays and private letters), but also at\nmajor meetings like the Hampton Conference (1892), the Chicago World\u2019s\nFair (1893), and the Pan African Conference (1900)\u2014to give only\na few examples.\n\n\nIn the early African American philosophical canon,\nactivist-intellectuals like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington,\nAlain Locke, and W.E.B. Du Bois tend to be the more readily recognized\nphilosophical figures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies in the United States than Anna Julia Cooper and other Black\nwomen scholars and activists from this era who are largely overlooked.\nThe canonization of Black men of this period is evidenced by\nbook-length scholarly publications produced throughout the 1990s such\nas Leonard Harris\u2019s The Philosophy of Alain Locke: Harlem\nRenaissance and Beyond (1991); Howard Brotz\u2019s African\nAmerican Social and Political Thought, 1850\u20131920 (1992);\nHoward McGary and Bill Lawson\u2019s Between Slavery and Freedom:\nPhilosophy and American Slavery (1993); and Howard McGary\u2019s\nRace and Social Justice (1999). Certainly, the works of prominent\nphilosophers who write about this tradition have made it\npossible even to describe an area of philosophy called \u201cAfrican\nAmerican Philosophy.\u201d Unfortunately these early contributions to\nAfrican American philosophical discourse frequently ignored the\nphilosophical contributions of African American women including\nCooper. Fortunately there is at least one exception to this exclusive\nfocus on men, specifically Joy James\u2019s Transcending the Talented\nTenth (1996) in which Anna Julia Cooper figures prominently\nbeside W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. James notes the ways\nin which Cooper argued for a bottom up rather than a top down approach\nto leadership and standard of measurement for liberation. Rather than\nfocusing on Black intellectual male elites, Cooper asserted that we\nmust pay attention to the conditions of working class and poor Black\nwomen. This position offers an ethics of the oppressed consistent\nwith many Black feminist philosophies and also comparable with\nContinental figures like Jean-Paul Sartre who makes similar claims\n decades \n later.[5]\n\n\nAttention to Cooper in the philosophical literature increases as we\nmove into the twenty-first century. For example, when it comes to\nanthologizing Cooper\u2019s scholarship her writings have been\nfeatured in over thirty anthologies, including philosophy anthologies\nsuch as James A. Montmarquet and William H. Hardy\u2019s\nReflections: An Anthology of African American Philosophy\n(2000); Leonard Harris, Scott L. Pratt, and Ann S. Waters\u2019s\nAmerican Philosophies: An Anthology (2001); and Tommy\nLott\u2019s African American Philosophy: Selected Readings\n(2002). More recently, Cooper has earned an important place in\narticles focusing specifically on African American women\u2019s\nphilosophical traditions in special issues of journals.\n Hypatia, Special Issue on Women in the American\nPhilosophical Tradition, Volume 19, Number 2, Spring 2004 (Edited\nby Dorothy Rogers and Therese B. Dykeman) is one example. This\nissue includes two articles on Cooper. The first by Cathryn\nBailey examines Cooper\u2019s philosophy of education (for Cooper,\nliberal arts education provided the tools needed to live an examined\nlife worth living rather than only earning a living) along with\nCooper\u2019s constructions of Black womanhood against prevailing\nnotions that Black women were not true women. And the second\nby Vivan M. May emphasizes Cooper\u2019s intersectional approaches to\nliberation and the epistemological significance of Cooper writing\nherself into typically exclusionary intellectual traditions.\n\nPhilosophia Africana: Analysis of Philosophy and Issues in\nAfrican and the Black Diaspora, Special Issue: Anna Julia\nCooper, Volume 12, Number 1, March 2009 (Edited by Kathryn T.\nGines and Ronald R. Sundstrom) is a special issue devoted entirely to\nCooper. The featured articles connect Cooper\u2019s feminist\nphilosophy with her social and political writings; virtue and care\nethics in Cooper\u2019s writings; romantic conceptions of human nature\nand flourishing; Cooper\u2019s legacy as a public intellectual; and\nher philosophy of social justice that informs her philosophy of\neducation. Likewise African American Review: Special Section\non Anna Julia Cooper, Volume 43, Number 2, Spring 2009 (Edited by\nShirley Moody-Turner) traces the trajectory of Cooper studies from A\nVoice from the South and beyond. Articles here take up\nCooper\u2019s contributions to social theorizing and ethical social\nrelations, race and gender domination, critiques of racial\nrepresentation, social and economic oppression, radical approaches to\neducation, and community advocacy.\n\n\nIn addition to Gines, Sundstrom, and Bailey above, prominent\nphilosophers like Lewis Gordon have also highlighted Cooper\u2019s\nphilosophical import, including her contributions to existentialism,\nBlack feminist philosophy, and theories of worth, in two important\ntexts. In Existentia Africana: Understanding Africana\nExistential Thought (2000) Gordon presents Cooper as a nineteenth\ncentury figure exploring questions of problematic existence and\nsuffering within black intellectual existential productions. \nCooper engaged ontological questions of being\u2014from liberation\nand humanization to revolution and freedom. With this in mind,\nGordon examines the existential dimensions of Cooper\u2019s A\nVoice from the South, placing it beside texts like W.E.B. Du\nBois\u2019s Souls of Black Folk, Ralph Ellison\u2019s\nGoing into the Territory, Frantz Fanon\u2019s Black Skin,\nWhite Masks, and Toni Morrison\u2019s Playing in the\nDark.\n\n\nIn An Introduction to Africana Philosophy\u2014Cambridge\nIntroductions to Philosophy (2008), Gordon asserts that Cooper,\n\u201cis without question the most sophisticated thinker on what is\nknown today as black feminist thought from the late nineteenth century\ninto the early twentieth century\u201d (Gordon 2008, 71).  More\nspecifically, Gordon explains how Cooper\u2019s A Voice from the\nSouth \u201carticulated the argument that continues to resonate\nin black feminist thought, namely, that black women must become agents\nof their own future, and that much of the health of their community\nrests on their shoulders because of the burdens they are forced to\ncarry.  This argument is advanced through her theory of worth, which\nshe issues in response to racist arguments against the value of black\npeople.\u201d Cooper\u2019s theory of worth, described by Gordon as\n\u201can efficiency theory of worth\u201d is especially evident in\nher essay \u201cWhat Are We Worth?\u201d (Gordon 2008, 71).  Gordon\nplaces Cooper\u2019s philosophical insights here in conversation with\nMarx (\u201cCooper, like Marx, was in fact working with a model of\nalienation that did not require the category of oppression, although\nsubjugation and correlates with slavery were hallmarks of their\nthought\u201d) and Nietzsche (both explored the relationship between\nworth and health\u2014those benefiting from absence of adversity are\nless healthy than those facing and overcoming adversity).\n\n\nThere is not yet a book length analysis written by a philosopher\nthat focuses on Cooper\u2019s philosophical import and contributions,\nhowever; one could certainly argue that Vivian M. May\u2019s Anna\nJulia Cooper, Visionary Black Feminist: A Critical Introduction\n(2007) offers the most comprehensive analysis of Cooper\u2019s\nwritings to date. Going against critical readings and\n(mis)interpretations of Cooper as an elitist who subscribed to Western\nethnocentrism and Victorian constructions of the \u201cCult of True\nWomanhood,\u201d May challenges Cooper\u2019s readers and critics to\nengage in a more nuanced analysis of her writings and activism.\nFor example, May emphasizes Cooper\u2019s activism (which is often\nmarginalized and/or erased altogether in the secondary literature) in a\nway that demonstrates how Cooper\u2019s lived experience and\nscholarship were quite anti-elitist. According to May,\n\u201cPerhaps, then, the challenge lies in developing flexible\ninterpretative strategies able to attend to Cooper\u2019s different\nvocal registers or resonances without silencing them, and more\nexpansive notions of political action or of counter-publics able to\nrecognize a broader range of activities as, in fact, activist\u201d\n(50). Additionally, in response to Stephanie Athey\u2019s\nframing of Cooper as problematically relying on eugenic language and\nideology, May presents a counter-argument reading Cooper as\ncontributing to an early materialist Black feminist analysis of Black\nwomen\u2019s oppression (55). Contra claims that Cooper sought\nto imitate whiteness or Western ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism, May\nunderscores Cooper\u2019s contention that \u201cimitation is the\nworst of suicide\u201d and adds, \u201cCooper argued that what\nAfrican Americans needed most was \u2018deliverance\u2019 from\nnormative whiteness\u201d (61). May also emphatically rejects\ndismissals of Cooper as a woman invested in the oppressive\nhabitus of \u201cTrue Womanhood,\u201d offering an alternate\nreading of Cooper as one who manipulates and strategically redeploys,\nrather than fully accepts or embraces, the tenets of True\nWomanhood.\n",
