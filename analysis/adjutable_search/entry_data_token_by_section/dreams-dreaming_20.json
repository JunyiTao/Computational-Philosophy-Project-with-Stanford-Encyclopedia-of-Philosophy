    "main_text": "The meaning of dreams and the functions of dreaming || The functions of dreaming\n7. Conclusions\n\nQuestions about dreaming in different areas of philosophy such as\nepistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and\nethics are closely intertwined. Scientific evidence from sleep and\ndream research can meaningfully inform the philosophical discussion\nand has often done so in the past. The discussion of dreaming has also\noften functioned as a lens on broader questions about knowledge,\nmorality, consciousness, and self. Long a marginalized area, the\nphilosophy of dreaming and of sleep is central to important\nphilosophical questions and increasingly plays an important role in\ninterdisciplinary consciousness research, for example in the search\nfor the neural correlates of conscious states, in conscious state\ntaxonomies, and in research on the minimal conditions for phenomenal\nselfhood and conscious experience.\n",
