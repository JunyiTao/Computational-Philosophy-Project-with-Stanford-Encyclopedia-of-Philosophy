    "main_text": "Contemporary Definitions || Historical Definitions\n4.3 Historical Definitions\n\n\nHistorical definitions hold that what characterizes artworks is\nstanding in some specified art-historical relation to some specified\nearlier artworks, and disavow any commitment to a trans-historical\nconcept of art, or the \u201cartish.\u201d Historical definitions\ncome in several varieties. All of them are, or resemble, inductive\ndefinitions: they claim that certain entities belong unconditionally\nto the class of artworks, while others do so because they stand in the\nappropriate relations thereto. According to the best known version,\nLevinson\u2019s intentional-historical definition, an artwork is a thing\nthat has been seriously intended for regard in any way preexisting or\nprior artworks are or were correctly regarded (Levinson 1990).  A\nsecond version, historical narrativism, comes in several varieties. On\none, a sufficient but not necessary condition for the identification\nof a candidate as a work of art is the construction of a true\nhistorical narrative according to which the candidate was created by\nan artist in an artistic context with a recognized and live artistic\nmotivation, and as a result of being so created, it resembles at least\none acknowledged artwork (Carroll 1993). On another, more ambitious\nand overtly nominalistic version of historical narrativism, something\nis an artwork if and only if (1) there are internal historical\nrelations between it and already established artworks; (2) these\nrelations are correctly identified in a narrative; and (3) that\nnarrative is accepted by the relevant experts. The experts do\nnot detect that certain entities are artworks; rather, the\nfact that the experts assert that certain properties are significant\nin particular cases is constitutive of art (Stock 2003).\n\n\nThe similarity of these views to institutionalism is obvious, and\nthe criticisms offered parallel those urged against institutionalism.\nFirst, historical definitions appear to require, but lack, any\ninformative characterization of art traditions (art functions, artistic\ncontexts, etc.) and hence any way of informatively distinguishing them\n(and likewise art functions, or artistic predecessors) from\nnon-art traditions (non-art functions, non-artistic\npredecessors). Correlatively, non-Western art, or alien, autonomous\nart of any kind appears to pose a problem for historical views: any\nautonomous art tradition or artworks \u2013 terrestrial,\nextra-terrestrial, or merely possible \u2013 causally isolated from\nour art tradition, is either ruled out by the definition, which seems\nto be a reductio, or included, which concedes the existence\nof a supra-historical concept of art. So, too, there could be entities\nthat for adventitious reasons are not correctly identified in\nhistorical narratives, although in actual fact they stand in relations\nto established artworks that make them correctly describable\nin narratives of the appropriate sort.  Historical definitions entail\nthat such entities aren\u2019t artworks, but it seems at least as \nplausible to say that they are artworks that are not identified as such.  Second,\nhistorical definitions also require, but do not provide a\nsatisfactory, informative account of the basis case \u2013 the first\nartworks, or ur-artworks, in the case of the intentional-historical\ndefinitions, or the first or central art-forms, in the case of\nhistorical functionalism.  Third, nominalistic historical definitions\nseem to face a version of the Euthyphro dilemma. For either\nsuch definitions include substantive characterizations of what it is\nto be an expert, or they don\u2019t. If, on one hand, they include no\ncharacterization of what it is to be an expert, and hence no\nexplanation as to why the list of experts contains the people it does,\nthen they imply that what makes things artworks is inexplicable.  On\nthe other hand, suppose such definitions provide a substantive account\nof what it is to be an expert, so that to be an expert is to possess\nsome ability lacked by non-experts (taste, say) in virtue of the\npossession of which they are able to discern historical connections\nbetween established artworks and candidate artworks.  Then the\ndefinition\u2019s claim to be interestingly historical is\nquestionable, because it makes art status a function of whatever\nability it is that permits experts to discern the art-making\nproperties. \n\n\nDefenders of historical definitions have replies. First, as regards\nautonomous art traditions, it can be held that anything we would\nrecognize as an art tradition or an artistic\npractice would display aesthetic concerns, because aesthetic concerns\nhave been central from the start, and persisted centrally for\nthousands of years, in the Western art tradition. Hence it is an\nhistorical, not a conceptual truth that anything we recognize as an\nart practice will centrally involve the aesthetic; it is just that\naesthetic concerns that have always dominated our art tradition\n(Levinson 2002). The idea here is that if the reason that anything\nwe\u2019d take to be a \u03a6-tradition would have \u03a8-concerns is\nthat our \u03a6-tradition has focused on \u03a8-concerns since its\ninception, then it is not essential to \u03a6-traditions that they have\n\u03a8-concerns, and \u03a6 is a purely historical concept. But\nthis principle entails, implausibly, that every concept is purely\nhistorical. Suppose that we discovered a new civilization whose\ninhabitants could predict how the physical world works with great\nprecision, on the basis of a substantial body of empirically acquired\nknowledge that they had accumulated over centuries. The reason we\nwould credit them with having a scientific tradition might\nwell be that our own scientific tradition has since its inception\nfocused on explaining things. It does not seem to follow that science\nis a purely historical concept with no essential connection to\nexplanatory aims. (Other theorists hold that it is historically\nnecessary that art begins with the aesthetic, but deny that\nart\u2019s nature is to be defined in terms of its historical\nunfolding (Davies 1997).) Second, as to the first artworks, or the\ncentral art-forms or functions, some theorists hold that an account of\nthem can only take the form of an enumeration. Stecker takes this\napproach: he says that the account of what makes something a central\nart form at a given time is, at its core, institutional, and that the\ncentral artforms can only be listed (Stecker 1997 and 2005). Whether\nrelocating the list at a different, albeit deeper, level in the\ndefinition renders the definition sufficiently informative is an open\nquestion. Third, as to the Euthyphro-style dilemma, it might\nbe held that the categorial distinction between artworks and\n\u201cmere real things\u201d (Danto 1981) explains the distinction\nbetween experts and non-experts. Experts are able, it is said, to\ncreate new categories of art. When created, new categories bring with\nthem new universes of discourse. New universes of discourse in turn\nmake reasons available that otherwise would not be available.  Hence,\non this view, it is both the case that the experts\u2019 say-so alone\nsuffices to make mere real things into artworks, and also true that\nexperts\u2019 conferrals of art-status have reasons (McFee\n2011). \n4.4 Traditional (mainly aesthetic) definitions\n\n\nTraditional definitions take some function(s) or intended function(s)\nto be definitive of artworks. Here only aesthetic definitions, which\nconnect art essentially with the aesthetic \u2013 aesthetic judgments,\nexperience, or properties \u2013 will be considered. Different\naesthetic definitions incorporate different views of aesthetic\nproperties and judgments. See the entry on \n aesthetic judgment.\n\n\nAs noted above, some philosophers lean heavily on a distinction\nbetween aesthetic properties and artistic properties, taking the\nformer to be perceptually striking qualities that can be directly\nperceived in works, without knowledge of their origin and purpose, and\nthe latter to be relational properties that works possess in virtue of\ntheir relations to art history, art genres, etc. It is also, of\ncourse, possible to hold a less restrictive view of aesthetic\nproperties, on which aesthetic properties need not be perceptual; on\nthis broader view, it is unnecessary to deny what it seems pointless\nto deny, that abstracta like mathematical entities and scientific laws\npossess aesthetic properties.)\n\n\nMonroe Beardsley\u2019s definition holds that an artwork:\n\u201ceither an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of\naffording an experience with marked aesthetic character or\n(incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of\narrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity\u201d\n(Beardsley 1982, 299).  (For more on Beardsley, see the entry on \n Beardsley\u2019s aesthetics.) \nBeardsley\u2019s conception of aesthetic experience is Deweyan:\naesthetic experiences are experiences that are complete, unified,\nintense experiences of the way things appear to us, and are, moreover,\nexperiences which are controlled by the things experienced (see the\nentry on\n Dewey\u2019s aesthetics).\nZangwill\u2019s aesthetic definition of art says that something is a\nwork of art if and only if someone had an insight that certain\naesthetic properties would be determined by certain nonaesthetic\nproperties, and for this reason the thing was intentionally endowed\nwith the aesthetic properties in virtue of the nonaesthetic properties\nas envisaged in the insight (Zangwill 1995a,b). Aesthetic properties\nfor Zangwill are those judgments that are the subject of\n\u201cverdictive aesthetic judgments\u201d (judgements of beauty and\nugliness) and \u201csubstantive aesthetic judgements\u201d (e.g., of\ndaintiness, elegance, delicacy, etc.). The latter are ways of being\nbeautiful or ugly; aesthetic in virtue of a special close relation to\nverdictive judgments, which are subjectively universal. Other\naesthetic definitions build in different accounts of the\naesthetic. Eldridge\u2019s aesthetic definition holds that the satisfying appropriateness to one another of a thing\u2019s form and content is the aesthetic quality possession of which is necessary and sufficient for\na thing\u2019s being art (Eldridge 1985). Or one might define aesthetic\nproperties as those having an evaluative component, whose perception\ninvolves the perception of certain formal base properties, such as\nshape and color (De Clercq 2002), and construct an aesthetic\ndefinition incorporating that view.\n\n\nViews which combine features of institutional and aesthetic\ndefinitions also exist. Iseminger, for example, builds a definition on\nan account of appreciation, on which to appreciate a thing\u2019s\nbeing F is to find experiencing its being F to be\nvaluable in itself, and an account of aesthetic communication (which it\nis the function of the artworld to promote) (Iseminger 2004).\n\n\nAesthetic definitions have been criticized for being both too narrow\nand too broad. They are held to be too narrow because they are unable\nto cover influential modern works like Duchamp\u2019s ready-mades and\nconceptual works like Robert Barry\u2019s All the things I know but of\nwhich I am not at the moment thinking \u2013 1:36 PM; June 15, 1969,\nwhich appear to lack aesthetic properties. (Duchamp famously asserted\nthat his urinal, Fountain, was selected for its lack of\naesthetic features.) Aesthetic definitions are held to be too broad\nbecause beautifully designed automobiles, neatly manicured lawns, and\nproducts of commercial design are often created with the intention of\nbeing objects of aesthetic appreciation, but are not artworks.\nMoreover, aesthetic views have been held to have trouble making sense\nof bad art (see Dickie 2001; Davies 2006, p. 37). Finally, more\nradical doubts about aesthetic definitions center on the\nintelligibility and usefulness of the aesthetic. Beardsley\u2019s view, for\nexample, has been criticized by Dickie, who has also offered\ninfluential criticisms of the idea of an aesthetic attitude (Dickie\n1965, Cohen 1973, Kivy 1975).\n\n\nTo these criticisms several responses have been offered. First, the\nless restrictive conception of aesthetic properties mentioned above,\non which they may be based on non-perceptual formal properties, can be\ndeployed. On this view, conceptual works would have aesthetic\nfeatures, much the same way that mathematical entities are often\nclaimed to (Shelley 2003, Carroll 2004). Second, a distinction may be\ndrawn between time-sensitive properties, whose standard observation\nconditions include an essential reference to the temporal location of\nthe observer, and non-time-sensitive properties, which do not.\nHigher-order aesthetic properties like drama, humor, and irony, which\naccount for a significant part of the appeal of Duchamp\u2019s and\nCage\u2019s works, on this view, would derive from time-sensitive\nproperties (Zemach 1997). Third, it might be held that it is the\ncreative act of presenting something that is in the\nrelevant sense unfamiliar, into a new context, the artworld, which has\naesthetic properties. Or, fourth, it might be held that\n(Zangwill\u2019s \u201csecond-order\u201d strategy) works like\nready-mades lack aesthetic functions, but are parasitic upon, because\nmeant to be considered in the context of, works that do have aesthetic\nfunctions, and therefore constitute marginal borderline cases of art\nthat do not merit the theoretical primacy they are often\ngiven. Finally, it can be flatly denied that the ready-mades were\nworks of art (Beardsley 1982).\n\n\nAs to the over-inclusiveness of aesthetic definitions, a distinction\nmight be drawn between primary and secondary functions. Or it may be\nmaintained that some cars, lawns, and products of industrial design are\non the art/non-art borderline, and so don\u2019t constitute clear\nand decisive counter-examples. Or, if the claim that aesthetic theories\nfail to account for bad art depends on holding that some works have\nabsolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever, as opposed to some\nnon-zero amount, however infinitesimal, it may be wondered what\njustifies that assumption. \n4.5 Hybrid (Disjunctive) Definitions\n\n\nHybrid definitions characteristically disjoin at least one\ninstitutional component with at least one aesthetic component, aiming\nthereby to accommodate both more traditional art and avant-garde art\nthat appears to lack any significant aesthetic dimension.  (Such\ndefinitions could also be classified as institutional, on the grounds\nthat they make provenance sufficient for being a work of art.) Hence\nthey inherit a feature of conventionalist definitions: in appealing to\nart institutions, artworlds, arts, art functions, and so on, they\neither include substantive accounts of what it is to be an\nartinstitution/world/genre/-form/function, or are\nuninformatively circular.\n\n\nOne such disjunctive definition, Longworth and Scarantino\u2019s, adapts\nGaut\u2019s list of ten clustering properties, where that list (see 3.5\nabove) includes institutional properties (e.g., belonging to an\nestablished art form) and traditional ones (e.g., possessing positive\naesthetic properties); see also Longworth and Scarantino 2010. The\ncore idea is that art is defined by a disjunction of minimally\nsufficient and disjunctively necessary conditions; to say that a\ndisjunct is a minimally sufficient constitutive condition for\nart-hood, is to say that every proper subset of it is insufficient for\nart-hood. An account of what it is for a concept to have disjunctive\ndefining conditions is also supplied.  The definition of art itself is\nas follows: \u2203Z\u2203Y (Art iff (Z \u2228\nY)), where (a) Z and Y, formed from properties on\nGaut\u2019s cluster list, are either non-empty conjunctions or non-empty\ndisjunctions of conjunctions or individual properties; (b) there is\nsome indeterminacy over exactly which disjuncts are sufficient; (c)\nZ does not entail Y and Y does not entail\nZ; (d) Z does not entail Art and Y does not\nentail Art. Instantiation of either Z or Y suffices for\nart-hood; something can be art only if at least one of Z,\nY is instantiated; and the third condition is included to\nprevent the definition from collapsing into a classical one. The\naccount of what it is for concept C to have disjunctive\ndefining conditions is as follows: C iff (Z \u2228\nY), where (i) Z and Y are non-empty conjunctions\nor non-empty disjunctions of conjunctions or individual properties;\n(ii) Z does not entail Y and Y does not entail\nZ; (iii) Z does not entail C and Y does not\nentail C. A worry concerns condition (iii): as written, it seems to\nrender the account of disjunctive defining conditions\nself-contradictory.  For if Z and Y are each minimally\nsufficient for C, it is impossible that Z does not\nentail C and that Y does not entail C. If so,\nthen nothing can satisfy the conditions said to be necessary and\nsufficient for a concept to have disjunctive defining conditions.\n\n\nA second disjunctive hybrid definition, with an historical cast,\nRobert Stecker\u2019s historical functionalism, holds that an item is an\nartwork at time t, where t is not earlier than the\ntime at which the item is made, if and only if it is in one of the\ncentral art forms at t and is made with the intention of\nfulfilling a function art has at t or it is an artifact that\nachieves excellence in achieving such a function (Stecker 2005).  A\nquestion for Stecker\u2019s view is whether or not it provides an adequate\naccount of what it is for a function to be an art function, and\nwhether, consequently, it can accommodate anti-aesthetic or\nnon-aesthetic art. The grounds given for thinking that it can are\nthat, while art\u2019s original functions were aesthetic, those functions,\nand the intentions with which art is made, can change in unforeseeable\nways. Moreover, aesthetic properties are not always preeminent in\nart\u2019s predecessor concepts (Stecker 2000). A worry is that if the\noperative assumption is that if x belongs to a predecessor\ntradition of T then x belongs to T, the\npossibility is not ruled out that if, for example, the tradition of\nmagic is a predecessor tradition of the scientific tradition, then\nentities that belong to the magic tradition but lacking any of the\nstandard hallmarks of science are scientific entities.\n\n\nA third hybrid definition, also disjunctive, is the cladistic\ndefinition defended by Stephen Davies.  who holds that something is\nart (a) if it shows excellence of skill and achievement in realizing\nsignificant aesthetic goals, and either doing so is its primary,\nidentifying function or doing so makes a vital contribution to the\nrealization of its primary, identifying function, or (b) if it falls\nunder an art genre or art form established and publicly recognized\nwithin an art tradition, or (c) if it is intended by its\nmaker/presenter to be art and its maker/presenter does what is\nnecessary and appropriate to realizing that intention (Davies, 2015).\n(In biology, a clade is a segment in the tree of life: a group\nof organisms and the common ancestor they share.) Artworlds are to be\ncharacterized in terms of their origins: they begin with prehistoric\nart ancestors, and grow into artworlds. Hence all artworks occupy a\nline of descent from their prehistoric art ancestors; that line of\ndescent comprises an art tradition that grows into an artworld.  So\nthe definition is bottom-up and resolutely anthropocentric. A worry:\nthe view seems to entail that art traditions can undergo any changes\nwhatsoever and remain art traditions, since, no matter how distant,\nevery occupant of the right line of descent is part of the art\ntradition. This seems to amount to saying that as long as they remain\ntraditions at all, art traditions cannot die. Whether art is immortal\nin this sense seems open to question.  A second worry is that the\nrequirement that every art tradition and artworld stand in some line\nof descent from prehistoric humanoids makes it in principle impossible\nfor any nonhuman species to make art, as long as that species fails to\noccupy the right location in the tree of life. While the\nepistemological challenges that identifying artworks made by nonhumans\nmight pose could be very considerable, this consequence of the\ncladistic definition\u2019s emphasis on lineage rather than traits raises a\nconcern about excessively insularity.\n\nA fourth hybrid definition is the \u201cbuck-passing\u201d view of Lopes, which\nattempts an escape from the stalemate between artwork-focused\ndefinitions over avant-garde anti-aesthetic cases by adopting a\nstrategy that shifts the focus of the definition of art away from\nartworks.  The strategy is to recenter philosophical efforts on\ndifferent problems, which require attention anyway: (a) the problem of\ngiving an account of each individual art, and (b) the problem of\ndefining what it is to be an art, the latter by giving an account of\nthe larger class of normative/appreciative kinds to which the arts\n(and some non-arts) belong. For, given definitions of the individual\narts, and a definition of what it is to be an art, if every artwork\nbelongs to at least one art (if it belongs to no existing art, then it\npioneers a new art), then a definition of artwork falls out: x\nis a work of art if and only if x is a work of K, where K is an\nart (Lopes 2014). When fully spelled out, the definition is\ndisjunctive: x is a work of art if and only if x is a\nwork belonging to art1 or x is a work belonging to\nart2 or x is a work belonging to art3\n\u2026. Most of the explanatory work is done by the theories of the\nindividual arts, since, given the assumption that every artwork\nbelongs to at least one art, possession of theories of the individual\narts would be necessary and sufficient for settling the artistic or\nnon-artistic status of any hard case, once it is determined what art a\ngiven work belongs to. As to what makes a practice an art, Lopes\u2019\npreferred answer seems to be institutionalism of a Dickiean variety:\nan art is an institution in which artists (persons who participate\nwith understanding in the making of artworks) make artworks to be\npresented to an artworld public. (Lopes 2014, Dickie 1984) Thus, on\nthis view, it is arbitrary which activities are artworld systems:\nthere is no deeper answer to the question of what makes music an art\nthan that it has the right institutional\n structure.[4] \nSo it is arbitrary which activities are arts. Two worries. First, the\nkey claim that every work of art belonging to no extant art pioneers a\nnew art may be defended on the grounds that any reason to say that a\nwork belonging to no extant artform is an artwork is a reason to say\nthat it pioneers a new artform.  In response, it is noted that the\nquestion of whether or not a thing belongs to an art arises only when,\nand because, there is a prior reason for thinking that the thing is an\nartwork.  So it seems that what it is to be an artwork is prior, in\nsome sense, to what it is to be an art.  Second, on the buck-passing\ntheory\u2019s institutional theory of the arts, which activities are arts\nis arbitrary.  This raises a version of the question that was raised\nabout the cladistic definition\u2019s ability to account for the existence\nof art outside our (Hominin) tradition.  Suppose the connection\nbetween a practice\u2019s traits and its status as an art are wholly\ncontingent. Then the fact that a practice in another culture that\nalthough not part of our tradition had most of the traits of one of\nour own arts would be no reason to think that practice was an art, and\nno reason to think that the objects belonging to it were artworks. It\nis not clear that we are really so in the dark when it comes to\ndetermining whether practices in alien cultures or traditions are\narts. \n5. Conclusion\n\n\nConventionalist definitions account well for modern art, but have\ndifficulty accounting for art\u2019s universality \u2013 especially\nthe fact that there can be art disconnected from \u201cour\u201d\n(Western) institutions and traditions, and our species.  They also\nstruggle to account for the fact that the same aesthetic terms are\nroutinely applied to artworks, natural objects, humans, and abstracta.\nAesthetic definitions do better accounting for art\u2019s\ntraditional, universal features, but less well, at least according to\ntheir critics, with revolutionary modern art; their further defense\nrequires an account of the aesthetic which can be extended in a\nprincipled way to conceptual and other radical art. (An aesthetic\ndefinition and a conventionalist one could simply be conjoined. But\nthat would merely raise, without answering, the fundamental question\nof the unity or disunity of the class of artworks.) Which defect is\nthe more serious one depends on which explananda are the more\nimportant. Arguments at this level are hard to come by, because\npositions are hard to motivate in ways that do not depend on prior\nconventionalist and functionalist sympathies. If list-like definitions\nare flawed because uninformative, then so are conventionalist\ndefinitions, whether institutional or historical. Of course, if the\nclass of artworks, or of the arts, is a mere chaotic heap, lacking any\ngenuine unity, then enumerative definitions cannot be faulted for\nbeing uninformative: they do all the explaining that it is possible to\ndo, because they capture all the unity that there is to capture. In\nthat case the worry articulated by one prominent aesthetician, who\nwrote earlier of the \u201cbloated, unwieldy\u201d concept of art\nwhich institutional definitions aim to capture, needs to be taken\nseriously, even if it turns out to be ungrounded: \u201cIt is not at\nall clear that these words \u2013 \u2018What is\nart?\u2019 \u2013 express anything like a single question, to which\ncompeting answers are given, or whether philosophers proposing answers\nare even engaged in the same debate\u2026.  The sheer variety of\nproposed definitions should give us pause. One cannot help wondering\nwhether there is any sense in which they are attempts to \u2026\nclarify the same cultural practices, or address the same issue\u201d\n(Walton 2007). ",
