    "main_text": "Doctrine on the Intellect\n5. Theory of Scientific Knowledge\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the term \u2018aql\n(intellect) is used in different ways. We have dealt with the way in\nwhich al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b uses it in the psychological context of\nAristotle\u2019s treatise On the Soul. However, in his\naccount of the different senses of the term, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nalso refers to its use in Posterior Analytics 2.19, where\nAristotle uses the term \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 in an\nepistemological context when he talks about a faculty of the soul by\nmeans of which certainty about necessary, true, and universal premises\nis attained. In his Aphorisms al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ndescribes the theoretical intellect in the same terms when he says\nthat this intellect \n\n\nis the faculty by which we attain by nature, and not by examination or\nsyllogistic reasoning, certain knowledge concerning the necessary,\nuniversal premises that are principles of the sciences.\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b SA: \u00a734, 28\u201329)\n\n\nBy \u201cprinciples of the sciences\u201d, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nrefers to principles such as \u2018the whole is greater than the\npart,\u2019 \u2018amounts equal to a single amount are mutually\nequal,\u2019 and premises of this kind, following Aristotle\nexplicitly once again. These premises are the first point from which a\nthing is known or comes to be known (Aristotle Metaphysics 5,\n1013a18). As explained earlier, the human intellect passes from\npotency to act through the assistance of the active intellect, and\nwhen the intellect in act becomes acquired intellect and reaches the\ncapacity to understand on its own, this means that it already has the\nactual disposition to infer and reason by itself. In other words, the\nintellect has attained the habit of knowledge, and therefore is able\nto attain scientific knowledge (\u2018ilm).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s understanding of \u201cscientific\nknowledge\u201d, has nothing to do with the modern notion of\n\u201cscience\u201d; rather he is using Aristotle\u2019s notion of\napodeixis, that is, a type of knowledge that guarantees\ncertainty, and is confined to mathematics and metaphysics. In this\nrespect, Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition after him are far\nfrom modern experimental science, since the main concern of the former\nis the attainment of absolute certainty. According to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, scientific knowledge is a virtue of the\ntheoretical intellect that enables the rational soul to attain\ncertainty about those beings whose existence and constitution do not\ndepend on human artifice, as well as what those beings are and how\nthey are, \n\n\nfrom demonstrations composed of accurate, necessary, and primary\npremises of which the intellect becomes certain and attains knowledge\nby nature. (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b SA: \u00a735, 29) \n\n\nThis language resembles that found in Posterior Analytics\n2.19, and also in Nicomachean Ethics 6.3.\n\nFollowing al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s explanation of\n\u2018ilm in his Aphorisms, there are two types of\nscientific knowledge: (1) becoming certain of the existence and the\nreason of the existence of a thing, and why it cannot possibly be\notherwise; and (2) becoming certain of the existence of a thing and\nwhy it cannot be something else, but without considering the reason\nfor its existence.\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b goes on to define scientific knowledge as\nbeing accurate, certain, and steadfast in any given moment, which\nmeans it does not change through time and does not go in and out of\nexistence. Certainty cannot contain doubt and falsehood, since what\ncan in any way be false cannot be considered certain or be said to be\nknowledge. For this very reason, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b points out\nthat the ancients did not consider sensation of what can change as\nknowledge; rather, scientific knowledge is confined to the\n\u201ccertainty\u201d about the existence of things that cannot\npossibly change. In order to explain this al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\noffers the example of the number three being always an odd number, and\nhow it cannot be otherwise.\n\nThe notion of \u201ccertainty\u201d (yaq\u012bn) has a\nrelevant place in al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s epistemology and is\nlinked also to his conception of the logical arts. In fact, he\nunderstands logic (man\u1e6diq) as a tool\n(\u0101lah) that leads to certainty when used correctly. He\nconceives five logical arts: demonstration, dialectic, sophistry,\nrhetoric, and poetics (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b ES: 37\u201345).\nDialectic engenders belief (\u1e93ann) through arguments\nbuilt upon generally-accepted opinions; sophistry is a logical art\nthat makes general opinions appear true; rhetoric persuades by means\nof appealing elocutions; poetics persuades by means of alluring or\nrepulsive images; finally, demonstration, the highest of the logical\narts, leads to certainty by means of universal and necessary\n premises.[8]\n The non-demonstrative logical arts\u2014dialectic, sophistry,\nrhetoric, and poetics\u2014engender opinion in different degrees\nwhereas, in contrast, demonstration engenders certainty. However, in\nsome places al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b admits that it could be the case\nthat these non-demonstrative arts would lead to assent to beliefs in a\nway very close to certainty (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KB: 20\u201321;\nBD: 64\u201365). For this reason, as D. Black (2006: 11\u201345) has\npointed out, it is important to distinguish in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b between \u201ccertainty\u201d\n(yaq\u012bn) and \u201cabsolute certainty\u201d\n(al-yaq\u012bn \u2018al\u0101 al-i\u1e6dl\u0101q). \n\nThere are two works where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b treats the notion\nof absolute certainty in detail. The first is his Book of\nDemonstration (Kit\u0101b al-burh\u0101n) and the second\nis the Book on the Conditions of Certitude (Kit\u0101b\n\u0160ara\u2019i\u1e6d al-yaq\u012bn). In both treatises\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b provides some conditions for absolute\ncertainty. The second treatise contains an exhaustive account of these\nconditions, six in number: (1) to believe that something is in some\nway and not another, (2) to agree that this belief corresponds and is\nnot opposed to the external existence of the thing, (3) to know the\ncorrespondence between the belief of the existence and the existence\nof the thing in reality, (4) to know that it is not possible for this\ncorrespondence to happen and there to be opposition, (5) to know that\nopposition between belief and reality cannot happen at any time, and\n(6) to know that all this is not accidental, but essential\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KY: 98). According to D. Black (2006: 16),\nthese conditions can be understood as follows:\n\n S believes that p (the belief condition);\n p is true (the truth condition);\n S knows that p is true (the knowledge\ncondition);\n it is impossible that p not be true (the necessity\ncondition);\n there is no time at which p can be false (the eternity\ncondition); and,\n conditions 1\u20135 hold essentially, not accidentally (the\nnon-accidentality condition).\n\n\nD. Black realizes that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s first three\nconditions for certainty seem to evoke the traditional tripartite\ndefinition of knowledge as \u201cjustified true belief\u201d, an\nessential and debated notion in contemporary epistemology. However, as\nD. Black herself notices, in al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b the\njustification condition, that is, \u2018having good reasons or\nsufficient evidence to believe something,\u2019 is replaced by the\nknowledge condition and, in this sense, knowledge itself becomes a\nnecessary ingredient within certainty, and therefore is insufficient\nfor raising a belief to the status of absolute certainty. For this\nreason, certainty for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b requires two conditions\nfrom the knower: (1) to know that a proposition x is true, and\n(2) to know that she knows. This is very close, as D. Black notices,\nto what contemporary epistemology calls \u201csecond\norder-knowledge\u201d (Black 2006: 19\u201321). \n\nIn the Book of Demonstration al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b states\nthat the goal of scientific demonstration is precisely absolute or\nnecessary certainty (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b KB: 26; BD: 68). In a\nvery short treatise entitled Introductory Letter on Logic\n(Ris\u0101lah sudira bih\u0101 al-kit\u0101b)\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b writes: \n\n\nPhilosophical discourse is called demonstrative. It seeks to teach and\nmake clear the truth in the things which are such that they afford\ncertain knowledge. (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b IR: 231) \n\n\nIt seems, therefore, that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has a strict\nconception of demonstrative science inspired by Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics. Nevertheless, although\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b gives demonstration and absolute certainty a\nrelevant place in his conception of philosophy, he also considers that\nour knowledge is not limited to absolute certainty. He also takes into\nconsideration other forms of knowledge that can lead us to what should\nbe called non-necessary certainty, as is the case with the different\nkinds of knowledge we attain by means of the non-demonstrative logical\narts. In this regard, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b considers that from the\ndifferent kinds of arguments we can conceive different degrees of\ncertainty and therefore, different kinds of beliefs (from absolute\ncertainty to non-necessary certainty or strong belief).\n",
