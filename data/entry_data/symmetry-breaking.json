    "main_text": "\n1. The Concept of Symmetry\n\nThe term \u201csymmetry\u201d derives from the Greek words\nsun (meaning \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018together\u2019)\nand metron (\u2018measure\u2019), yielding\nsummetria, and originally indicated a relation of\ncommensurability (such is the meaning codified in Euclid\u2019s\nElements for example). It quickly acquired a further, more\ngeneral, meaning: that of a proportion relation, grounded on (integer)\nnumbers, and with the function of harmonizing the different\nelements into a unitary whole. From the outset, then,\nsymmetry was closely related to harmony, beauty, and unity, and this\nwas to prove decisive for its role in theories of nature. In\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, for example, the regular polyhedra are\nafforded a central place in the doctrine of natural elements for the\nproportions they contain and the beauty of their forms: fire has the\nform of the regular tetrahedron, earth the form of the cube, air the\nform of the regular octahedron, water the form of the regular\nicosahedron, while the regular dodecahedron is used for the form of\nthe entire universe. The history of science provides another\nparadigmatic example of the use of these figures as basic ingredients\nin physical description: Kepler\u2019s 1596 Mysterium\nCosmographicum presents a planetary architecture grounded on the\nfive regular solids.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, the regular figures used in Plato\u2019s\nand Kepler\u2019s physics for the mathematical proportions and\nharmonies they contain (and the related properties and beauty of their\nform) are symmetric in another sense that does not have to do with\nproportions. In the language of modern science, the symmetry of\ngeometrical figures \u2014 such as the regular polygons and polyhedra\n\u2014 is defined in terms of their invariance under specified groups\nof rotations and reflections. Where does this definition stem from? In\naddition to the ancient notion of symmetry used by the Greeks and\nRomans (current until the end of the Renaissance), a different notion\nof symmetry emerged in the seventeenth century, grounded not on\nproportions but on an equality relation between elements that are\nopposed, such as the left and right parts of a figure. Crucially, the\nparts are interchangeable with respect to the whole \u2014\nthey can be exchanged with one another while preserving the original\nfigure. This latter notion of symmetry developed, via several steps,\ninto the concept found today in modern science. One crucial stage was\nthe introduction of specific mathematical operations, such as\nreflections, rotations, and translations, that are used to describe\nwith precision how the parts are to be exchanged. As a result, we\narrive at a definition of the symmetry of a geometrical figure in\nterms of its invariance when equal component parts are\nexchanged according to one of the specified operations. Thus, when the\ntwo halves of a bilaterally symmetric figure are exchanged by\nreflection, we recover the original figure, and that figure is said to\nbe invariant under left-right reflections. This is known as the\n\u201ccrystallographic notion of symmetry\u201d, since it was in the\ncontext of early developments in crystallography that symmetry was\nfirst so defined and\n applied.[1]\n The next key step was the generalization of this notion to the\ngroup-theoretic definition of symmetry, which arose following the\nnineteenth-century development of the algebraic concept of a group,\nand the fact that the symmetry operations of a figure were found to\nsatisfy the conditions for forming a\n group.[2]\n For example, reflection symmetry has now a precise definition in\nterms of invariance under the group of reflections. Finally, we have\nthe resulting close connection between the notion of symmetry,\nequivalence and group: a symmetry group induces a partition into\nequivalence classes. The elements that are exchanged with one another\nby the symmetry transformations of the figure (or whatever the\n\u201cwhole\u201d considered is) are connected by an equivalence\nrelation, thus forming an equivalence\n class.[3]\n\nThe group-theoretic notion of symmetry is the one that has proven so\nsuccessful in modern science. Note, however, that symmetry remains\nlinked to beauty (regularity) and unity: by means of the symmetry\ntransformations, distinct (but \u201cequal\u201d or, more generally,\n\u201cequivalent\u201d) elements are related to each other and to\nthe whole, thus forming a regular \u201cunity\u201d. The way in\nwhich the regularity of the whole emerges is dictated by the nature of\nthe specified transformation group. Summing up, a unity of\ndifferent and equal elements is always associated with symmetry,\nin its ancient or modern sense; the way in which this unity is\nrealized, on the one hand, and how the equal and different elements\nare chosen, on the other hand, determines the resulting symmetry and\nin what exactly it consists.\n\nThe definition of symmetry as \u201cinvariance under a specified\ngroup of transformations\u201d allowed the concept to be applied much\nmore widely, not only to spatial figures but also to abstract objects\nsuch as mathematical expressions \u2014 in particular, expressions of\nphysical relevance such as dynamical equations. Moreover, the\ntechnical apparatus of group theory could then be transferred and used\nto great advantage within physical\n theories.[4]\n\nWhen considering the role of symmetry in physics from a historical\npoint of view, it is worth keeping in mind two preliminary\ndistinctions:\n\nThe first is between implicit and explicit uses of the notion.\nSymmetry considerations have always been applied to the description\nof  nature, but for a long time in an implicit way only. As we\nhave seen, the scientific notion of symmetry (the one we are\ninterested in here) is a recent one. If we speak about a role of this\nconcept of symmetry in the ancient theories of nature, we must be\nclear that it was not used explicitly in this sense at that time.\nThe second is between the two main ways of using symmetry. First,\nwe may attribute specific symmetry properties to phenomena or to laws\n(symmetry principles). It is the application with respect to\nlaws, rather than to objects or phenomena, that has become central to\nmodern physics, as we will see. Second, we may derive specific\nconsequences with regard to particular physical situations or\nphenomena on the basis of their symmetry properties (symmetry\narguments).\n\n2. Symmetry Principles\n\nThe first explicit study of the invariance properties of equations in\nphysics is connected with the introduction, in the first half of the\nnineteenth century, of the transformational approach to the problem of\nmotion in the framework of analytical mechanics. Using the formulation\nof the dynamical equations of mechanics due to W. R. Hamilton (known\nas the Hamiltonian or canonical formulation), C. G. Jacobi developed a\nprocedure for arriving at the solution of the equations of motion\nbased on the strategy of applying transformations of the variables\nthat leave the Hamiltonian equations invariant, thereby transforming\nstep by step the original problem into new ones that are simpler but\nperfectly equivalent (for further details see Lanczos\n 1949).[5]\n Jacobi\u2019s canonical transformation theory, although introduced\nfor the \u201cmerely instrumental\u201d purpose of solving dynamical\nproblems, led to a very important line of research: the general study\nof physical theories in terms of their transformation properties.\nExamples of this are the studies of invariants under canonical\ntransformations, such as Poisson brackets or Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nintegral invariants; the theory of continuous canonical\ntransformations due to S. Lie; and, finally, the connection between\nthe study of physical invariants and the algebraic and geometric\ntheory of invariants that flourished in the second half of the\nnineteenth century, and which laid the foundation for the geometrical\napproach to dynamical problems. The use of the mathematics of group\ntheory to study physical theories was central to the work, early in\nthe twentieth century in G\u00f6ttingen, of the group whose central\nfigures were F. Klein (who earlier collaborated with Lie) and D.\nHilbert, and which included H. Weyl and later E. Noether. We will\nreturn later in this section to Weyl (see\n Sections 2.1.2,\n 2.2,\n 2.5)\n and Noether (see\n Section 2.1.2).\n For more details on these developments see Brading and Castellani\n(2007).\n\nOn the above approach, the equations or expressions of physical\ninterest are already given, and the strategy is to study their\nsymmetry properties. There is, however, an alternative way of\nproceeding, namely the reverse one: start with specific symmetries and\nsearch for dynamical equations with such properties. In other words,\nwe postulate that certain symmetries are physically\nsignificant, rather than deriving them from prior dynamical equations.\nThe assumption of certain symmetries in nature is not, of course, a\nnovelty. Although not explicitly expressed as symmetry principles, the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of physical space, and the uniformity of time\n(forming together with the invariance under Galilean boosts \u201cthe\nolder principles of invariance\u201d \u2014 see Wigner\n 1967,[6]\n pp. 4\u20135), have been assumed as prerequisites in the physical\ndescription of the world since the beginning of modern science.\nPerhaps the most famous early example of the deliberate use of this\ntype of symmetry principle is Galileo\u2019s discussion of whether\nthe Earth moves in his Dialogue concerning the two chief world\nsystems of 1632. Galileo sought to neutralize the standard\narguments purporting to show that, simply by looking around us at how\nthings behave locally on Earth \u2014 how stones fall, how birds fly\n\u2014 we can conclude that the Earth is at rest rather than\nrotating, arguing instead that these observations do not enable us to\ndetermine the state of motion of the Earth. His approach was to use an\nanalogy with a ship: he urges us to consider the behaviour of objects,\nboth animate and inanimate, inside the cabin of a ship, and claims\nthat no experiments carried out inside the cabin, without reference to\nanything outside the ship, would enable us to tell whether the ship is\nat rest or moving smoothly across the surface of the Earth. The\nassumption of a symmetry between rest and a certain kind of\nmotion leads to the prediction of this result, without the need to\nknow the details of the laws governing the experiments on the ship.\nThe \u201cGalilean principle of relativity\u201d (according to which\nthe laws of physics are invariant under Galilean boosts, where the\nstates of motion considered are now those of uniform velocity) was\nquickly adopted as an axiom and widely used in the seventeenth\ncentury, notably by Huygens in his solution to the problem of\ncolliding bodies and by Newton in his early work on motion. Huygens\ntook the relativity principle as his 3rd hypothesis or axiom, but in\nNewton\u2019s Principia it is demoted to a corollary to the laws of\nmotion, its status in Newtonian physics therefore being that of a\nconsequence of the laws, even though it remains, in fact, an\nindependent assumption.\n\nAlthough the spatial and temporal invariance of mechanical laws was\nknown and used for a long time in physics, and the group of the global\nspacetime symmetries for electrodynamics was completely derived by H.\nPoincar\u00e9\n [7]\n before Einstein\u2019s famous 1905 paper setting out his special\ntheory of relativity, it was not until this work by Einstein that the\nstatus of symmetries with respect to the laws was reversed. E. P.\nWigner (1967, p. 5) writes that \u201cthe significance and general\nvalidity of these principles were recognized, however, only by\nEinstein\u201d, and that Einstein\u2019s work on special relativity\nmarks \u201cthe reversal of a trend: until then, the principles of\ninvariance were derived from the laws of motion \u2026 It is now\nnatural for us to derive the laws of nature and to test their validity\nby means of the laws of invariance, rather than to derive the laws of\ninvariance from what we believe to be the laws of nature\u201d. In\npostulating the universality of the global continuous spacetime\nsymmetries, Einstein\u2019s construction of his special theory of\nrelativity represents the first turning point in the application of\nsymmetry to twentieth-century\n physics.[8]\n2.1 Relativity\n2.1.1 The special theory of relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity (STR) is constructed on\nthe basis of two fundamental postulates. One is the light postulate\n(that the speed of light, in the \u201crest frame\u201d, is\nindependent of the speed of the source), and the other is the\nprinciple of relativity. The latter was adopted by Einstein explicitly\nas a means of restricting the form of the laws, whatever their\ndetailed structure might turn out to be. Thus, we have the difference\nbetween a \u201cconstructive\u201d and a \u201cprinciple\u201d\ntheory: in the former case we build our theory based on known facts\nabout the constitution and behaviour of material bodies; in the latter\ncase we start by restricting the possible form of such a theory by\nadopting certain\n principles.[9]\n\nThe principle of relativity as adopted by Einstein (1905, p. 395 of\nthe English translation) simply asserts that:\n\nThe laws by which the states of physical systems undergo changes are\nindependent of whether these changes of states are referred to one or\nthe other of two coordinate systems moving relatively to each other in\nuniform translational motion.\n\n\nThis principle, when combined with the light postulate (and certain\nother assumptions), leads to the Lorentz transformations, these being\nthe transformations between coordinate systems moving uniformly with\nrespect to one another according to STR. According to STR the laws of\nphysics are invariant under Lorentz transformations, and indeed under\nthe full Poincar\u00e9 group of transformations. These\ntransformations differ from the Galilean transformations of Newtonian\nmechanics. H. Minkowski reformulated STR, showing that space and time\nare part of a single four-dimensional geometry, Minkowski spacetime.\nIn this way, the Poincar\u00e9 group of symmetry transformations is\npart of the structure of spacetime in STR, and for this reason these\nsymmetries have been labelled \u201cgeometric symmetries\u201d by\nWigner (1967, especially pp. 15 and 17\u201319).\n\nThere is a debate in the literature concerning how the principle of\nrelativity, and more generally the global space-time symmetries,\nshould be understood. On one approach, the significance of space-time\nsymmetries is captured by considering the structure of a theory\nthrough transformations on its models, those models consisting of\ndifferentiable manifolds endowed with various geometric objects and\nrelations (see Anderson, 1967, and Norton, 1989). According to Brown\nand Sypel (1995) and Budden (1997), this approach fails to recognise\nthe central importance of effectively isolated subsystems, the\nempirical significance of symmetries resting on the possibility of\ntransforming such a subsystem (rather than applying the transformation\nto the entire universe). For further developments in this debate,\nincluding applications to local symmetries and to gauge theories, see\nKosso (2000), Brading and Brown (2004), Healey (2007), Healey (2009),\nGreaves and Wallace (2014), Friederich (2015), Rovelli (2014), Teh\n(2015, 2016) and Wallace (2022).\n\nThe global spacetime invariance principles are intended to be valid\nfor all the laws of nature, for all the processes that unfold in the\nspacetime. This universal character is not shared by the physical\nsymmetries that were next introduced in physics. Most of these were of\nan entirely new kind, with no roots in the history of science, and in\nsome cases expressly introduced to describe specific forms of\ninteractions \u2014 whence the name \u201cdynamical\nsymmetries\u201d due to Wigner (1967, see especially pp. 15,\n17\u201318, 22\u201327, 33).\n2.1.2 The general theory of relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity (GTR) was also\nconstructed using a symmetry principle at its heart: the principle of\ngeneral covariance. Much ink has been spilled over the significance\nand role of general covariance in GTR, including by Einstein\n himself.[10]\n For a long time he viewed the principle of general covariance as an\nextension of the principle of relativity found in both classical\nmechanics and STR, and this is a view that continues to provoke\nvigorous debate. Norton (2003) discusses the \u201cKretschmann\nobjection\u201d to the physical significance of general covariance.\nOn invariance versus covariance, see Anderson (1967), Brown and\nBrading (2002), and Martin (2003, Section 2.2). What is clear is that\nthe mere requirement that a theory be generally covariant represents\nno restriction on the form of the theory; further stipulations must be\nadded, such as the requirement that there be no \u201cabsolute\nobjects\u201d (this itself being a problematic notion). Once some\nsuch further requirements are added, however, the principle of general\ncovariance becomes a powerful tool. For a recent review and analysis\nof this debate, see Pitts (2006).\n\nIn Einstein\u2019s hands the principle of general covariance was a\ncrucial postulate in the development of\n GTR.[11]\n The diffeomorphism freedom of GTR, i.e., the invariance of the form\nof the laws under transformations of the coordinates depending\nsmoothly on arbitrary functions of space and time, is a\n\u201clocal\u201d spacetime symmetry, in contrast to the\n\u201cglobal\u201d spacetime symmetries of STR (which depend instead\non constant parameters). For a discussion of coordinate-based\napproaches to the diffeomorphism invariance of General Relativity, see\nWallace (2019), and for more on the physical interpretation of this\ninvariance, see Pooley (2017). Such local symmetries are\n\u201cdynamical\u201d symmetries in Wigner\u2019s sense, since they\ndescribe a particular interaction, in this case gravity. As is well\nknown, the spacetime metric in GTR is no longer a\n\u201cbackground\u201d field or an \u201cabsolute object\u201d,\nbut instead it is a dynamical player, the gravitational field\nmanifesting itself as spacetime curvature.\n\nThe extension of the concept of continuous symmetry from\n\u201cglobal\u201d symmetries (such as the Galilean group of\nspacetime transformations) to \u201clocal\u201d symmetries is one of\nthe important developments in the concept of symmetry in physics that\ntook place in the twentieth century. Prompted by GTR, Weyl\u2019s\n1918 \u201cunified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism\u201d\nextended the idea of local symmetries (see Ryckman, 2003, and Martin,\n2003), and although this theory is generally deemed to have failed,\nthe theory contains the seeds of later success in the context of\nquantum theory (see below,\n Section 2.5).\n\nMeanwhile, Hilbert and Klein undertook detailed investigations\nconcerning the role of general covariance in theories of gravitation,\nand enlisted the assistance of Noether in their debate over the status\nof energy conservation in such theories. This led to Noether\u2019s\nfamous 1918 paper containing two theorems, the first of which leads to\na connection between global symmetries and conservation laws, and the\nsecond of which leads to a number of results associated with local\nsymmetries, including a demonstration of the different status of the\nconservation laws when the global symmetry group is a subgroup of some\nlocal symmetry group of the theory in question (see Brading and Brown,\n2003). A detailed, recent collective volume on the\nphilosophy and physics of Noether\u2019s theorems is Read\nand Teh  (2022).  \n2.2 Symmetry and quantum mechanics\n\nThe application of the theory of groups and their representations for\nthe exploitation of symmetries in the quantum mechanics of the 1920s\nundoubtedly represents the second turning point in the\ntwentieth-century history of physical symmetries. It is, in fact, in\nthe quantum context that symmetry principles are at their most\neffective. Wigner and Weyl were among the first to recognize the great\nrelevance of symmetry groups to quantum physics and the first to\nreflect on the meaning of this. As Wigner emphasized on many\noccasions, one essential reason for the \u201cincreased effectiveness\nof invariance principles in quantum theory\u201d (Wigner, 1967, p.\n47) is the linear nature of the state space of a quantum physical\nsystem, corresponding to the possibility of superposing quantum\nstates. This gives rise to, among other things, the possibility of\ndefining states with particularly simple transformation properties in\nthe presence of symmetries.\n\nIn general, if G is a symmetry group of a theory describing a\nphysical system (that is, the dynamical equations of the theory are\ninvariant under the transformations of G), this means that\nthe states of the system transform into each other according to some\n\u201crepresentation\u201d of the group G. In other words,\nthe group transformations are mathematically represented in the state\nspace by operations relating the states to each other. Roberts (2022,\n2.3) characterizes this as an essential requirement for concept\nlike \u201cdynamical evolution\u201d and \u201cspatial\ntranslation\u201d to have meaning in state-space theory, which\nhe refers to as the Representation View.  In the state space of\nquantum mechanics, these operations are implemented through the\noperators that act on the state space and correspond to the physical\nobservables, and any state of a physical system can be described as a\nsuperposition of states of elementary systems, that is, of systems the\nstates of which transform according to the \u201cirreducible\u201d\nrepresentations of the symmetry group. Quantum mechanics thus offers a\nparticularly favourable framework for the application of symmetry\nprinciples. The observables representing the action of the symmetries\nof the theory in the state space, and therefore commuting with the\nHamiltonian of the system, play the role of the conserved quantities;\nfurthermore, the eigenvalue spectra of the invariants of the symmetry\ngroup provide the labels for classifying the irreducible\nrepresentations of the group: on this fact is grounded the possibility\nof associating the values of the invariant properties characterizing\nphysical systems with the labels of the irreducible representations of\nsymmetry groups, i.e. of classifying elementary physical systems by\nstudying the irreducible representations of the symmetry groups.\n2.3 Permutation symmetry\n\nThe first non-spatiotemporal symmetry to be introduced into\nmicrophysics, and also the first symmetry to be treated with the\ntechniques of group theory in the context of quantum mechanics, was\npermutation symmetry (or invariance under the transformations\nof the permutation group). This symmetry, \u201cdiscovered\u201d by\nW. Heisenberg in 1926 in relation to the indistinguishability of the\n\u201cidentical\u201d electrons of an atomic\n system,[12]\n is the discrete symmetry (i.e. based upon groups with a\ndiscrete set of elements) at the core of the so-called quantum\nstatistics (the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics), governing\nthe statistical behaviour of ensembles of certain types of\nindistinguishable quantum particles (e.g. bosons and fermions). The\npermutation symmetry principle states that if such an ensemble is\ninvariant under a permutation of its constituent particles then one\ndoesn\u2019t count those permutations which merely exchange\nindistinguishable particles, that is the exchanged state is identified\nwith the original state (see French and Rickles, 2003, Section 1).\n\nPhilosophically, permutation symmetry has given rise to two main sorts\nof questions. On the one side, seen as a condition of physical\nindistinguishability of identical particles (i.e. particles of the\nsame kind in the same atomic system), it has motivated a rich debate\nabout the significance of the notions of identity, individuality, and\nindistinguishability in the quantum domain. Does it mean that the\nquantum particles are not individuals? Does the existence of entities\nwhich are physically indistinguishable although \u201cnumerically\ndistinct\u201d (the so-called problem of identical particles) imply\nthat the Leibniz\u2019s Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\nshould be regarded as violated in quantum physics? On the other side,\nwhat is the theoretical and empirical status of this symmetry\nprinciple? Should it be considered as an axiom of quantum mechanics or\nshould it be taken as justified empirically? It is currently taken to\nexplain the nature of fermionic and bosonic quantum statistics, but\nwhy do there appear to be only bosons and fermions in the world when\nthe permutation symmetry group allows the possibility of many more\ntypes? French and Rickles (2003) offer an overview of the above and\nrelated issues, and a new twist in the tale can be found in Saunders\n(2006). Saunders discusses permutation symmetry in classical physics,\nand argues for indistinguishable classical particles obeying classical\nstatistics. He argues that the differences between quantum and\nclassical statistics, for certain classes of particles, therefore\ncannot be accounted for solely in terms of indistinguishability. For\nfurther discussion and references see French and Krause (2006),\nLadyman and Bigaj (2010), Caulton and Butterfield (2012), and the\nrelated SEP entry\n identity and individuality in quantum theory.\n2.4 C, P, T\n\nBecause of the specific properties of the quantum description, the\ndiscrete symmetries of spatial reflection symmetry or parity\n(P) and time reversal (T) were\n\u201crediscovered\u201d in the quantum context, taking on a new\nsignificance. Parity was introduced in quantum physics in 1927 in a\npaper by Wigner, where important spectroscopic results were explained\nfor the first time on the basis of a group-theoretic treatment of\npermutation, rotation and reflection symmetries. Time reversal\ninvariance appeared in the quantum context, again due to Wigner, in a\n1932\n paper.[13]\n To these was added the new quantum particle-antiparticle symmetry or\ncharge conjugation (C). Charge conjugation was\nintroduced in Dirac\u2019s famous 1931 paper \u201cQuantized\nsingularities in the electromagnetic field\u201d.\n\nThe discrete symmetries C, P and T are\nconnected by the so-called CPT theorem, first proved by L\u00fcders\nand Pauli in the early 1950s, which states that the combination of\nC, P, and T is a general symmetry of\nLorentz-invariant physical laws. For philosophical reflections on the\nmeaning and grounding of the CPT theorem see Wallace (2009) and\nGreaves (2010). Greaves (2010) in particular argues that the\nquantization of the classical T operator leads to a CT operator, using\nthis in support of Feynman\u2019s famous suggestion that time reversal\nhas the effect of transforming particles into anti-particles. Roberts\n(2022, 2.8) argues against this claim, by maintaining that the\nFeynman\u2019s approach is an artifact that does not accurately capture the\ndescription of temporal symmetry. A discussion of the proofs of\nthe theorem, both within the standard quantum field theory framework\nand the axiomatic field theory framework, is provided in Greaves and\nThomas (2014).\n\nThe laws governing gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong\ninteraction are invariant with respect to C, P and\nT independently. However, in 1956 T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang\npointed out that \u03b2-decay, governed by the weak interaction, had\nnot yet been tested for invariance under P. Soon afterwards\nC. S. Wu and her colleagues performed an experiment showing that the\nweak interaction violates parity. Nevertheless, \u03b2-decay respects\nthe combination of C and P as a symmetry. In 1964,\nhowever, CP was found to be violated in weak interaction by\nCronin and Fitch in an experiment involving K-mesons. This implied, in\nvirtue of the CPT theorem, the violation of T-symmetry as\nwell; since then, there have been direct observations of\nT-symmetry violation, as reported by e.g., CPLEAR\nCollaboration (1998). For a careful analysis of the underlying\nassumptions working in the assessment of T-violation see\nRoberts (2015) and Ashtekar (2015). The philosophical puzzle is how we\ncan come to know this time asymmetry, given that we cannot truly\n\u2018reverse\u2019 time. Roberts proposes three templates for\nexplaining how this is possible, drawing in particular on a version of\nCurie\u2019s principle. By contrast, Go\u0142osz (2016) argues that\nthis asymmetry should be understood as applying to a physical process,\nrather than to time itself. Roberts (2022, Chapter 7) responds\nthat, on the Representation View, the asymmetry does indeed apply to\ntime itself.\n\nThis debate stems from the more basic question of what time\nreversal symmetry actually means. Some have argued that the textbook\ntime reversal operator T does not really represent the reversal\nof time alone, due to its unusual properties like conjugation of the\nwavefunction and the reversal of magnetic fields, including Albert\n(2000), Callender (2000), Lopez (2021, 2023). Others maintain,\ninstead, that the T operator is indeed the right definition of\ntime reversal, including Earman (2002), Malament (2004) and\nRoberts (2017). An ecumenical response is given by Roberts (2022,\nChapter 2), arguing that these two approaches can be viewed as the two\nsides of the same coin, corresponding, respectively, to a reversal of\ntime translations on spacetime and to the representation of that\nreversal on state space. A response in a similar spirit for\nelectromagnetism is given by Struyve (forthcoming). \n\nThe existence of parity violation in our fundamental laws has led to a\nnew chapter in an old philosophical debate concerning chiral or handed\nobjects and the nature of space. A description of a left hand and one\nof a right hand will not differ so long as no appeal is made to\nanything beyond the relevant hand. Yet left and right hands do\ndiffer  \u2014 a left-handed glove will not fit on a right hand.\nFor a brief period,  Kant saw in this reason to prefer a\nsubstantivalist account of space over a relational one, the difference\nbetween left and right hands lying in their relation to absolute\nspace. Regardless of whether this substantivalist solution succeeds,\nthere remains the challenge to the relationalist of accounting for the\ndifference between what Kant called \u201cincongruent\ncounterparts\u201d \u2014 objects which are the mirror-image of one\nanother and yet cannot be made to coincide by any rigid motion. The\nrelationalist may respond by denying that there is any\nintrinsic difference between a left and a right hand, and\nthat the incongruence is to be accounted for in terms of the relations\nbetween the two hands (if a universe was created with only one hand in\nit, it would be neither left nor right, but the second hand to be\ncreated would be either incongruent or congruent with it). This\nresponse becomes problematic in the face of parity violation, where\none possible experimental outcome is much more likely than its\nmirror-image. Since the two possible outcomes don\u2019t differ\nintrinsically, how should we account for the imbalance? This issue\ncontinues to be discussed in the context of the\nsubstantivalist-relationalist debate. For further details see Pooley\n(2003) and Saunders (2007).\n2.5 Gauge symmetry\n\nThe starting point for the idea of continuous internal\nsymmetries was the interpretation of the presence of particles\nwith (approximately) the same value of mass as the components\n(states) of a single physical system, connected to each other\nby the transformations of an underlying symmetry group. This idea\nemerged by analogy with what happened in the case of permutation\nsymmetry, and was in fact due to Heisenberg (the discoverer of\npermutation symmetry), who in a 1932 paper introduced the SU(2)\nsymmetry connecting the proton and the neutron (interpreted as the two\nstates of a single system). This symmetry was further studied by\nWigner, who in 1937 introduced the term isotopic spin (later\ncontracted to isospin). The various internal symmetries are\ninvariances under phase transformations of the quantum states and are\ndescribed in terms of the unitary groups SU(N). The term\n\u201cgauge\u201d is sometimes used for all continuous internal\nsymmetries, and is sometimes reserved for the local versions\n(these being at the core of the Standard Model for elementary\n particles).[14]\n \n\nThe phase of the quantum wavefunction encodes internal degrees of\nfreedom. With the requirement that a theory be invariant under\nlocal gauge transformations involving the phase of the\nwavefunction, Weyl\u2019s ideas of 1918 found a successful home in\nquantum theory (see O\u2019Raifeartaigh, 1997). Weyl\u2019s new 1929\ntheory was a theory of electromagnetism coupled to matter. The history\nof gauge theory is surveyed briefly by Martin (2003), who highlights\nvarious issues surrounding gauge symmetry, in particular the status of\nthe so-called \u201cgauge principle\u201d, first proposed by Weyl. A\nrecent account of the conceptual structure of the gauge\nargument is provided by Gomes, Roberts and Butterfield\n(2022). The main steps in development of gauge theory are the\nYang and Mills non-Abelian gauge theory of 1954, and the problems and\nsolutions associated with the successful development of gauge theories\nfor the short-range weak and strong interactions. In subsequent years,\nwe have come to understand that \u201clocal\u201d gauge symmetries are not just\na feature of electromagnetism, but also of the majority of our\nbest theories, including various gravitational theories and\nmodels within condensed matter physics. \n\nThe main philosophical questions raised by gauge theory all hinge upon\nhow we should understand the relationship between mathematics and\nphysics. There are two broad categories of discussion. The first\nconcerns the gauge principle, already mentioned, and the issue here is\nthe extent to which the requirement that we write our theories in\nlocally-symmetric form enables us to derive new physics. The analysis\nconcerns listing what premises constitute the gauge principle,\nexamining the status of these premises and what motivation might be\ngiven for them, determining precisely what can be obtained on the\nbasis of these premises, and what more needs to be added in order to\narrive at a (successful) physical theory. For discussion of this\nargument, see Teller (2000), Martin (2003) and Gomes et al\n(2022). In Teh (forthcoming), the case is made that the debate\nsurrounding the gauge principle is related to the debate about\nthe difference between substantive and non-substantive forms of\n\u201cgeneral covariance\u201d, a term that is used to\npick out the \u201clocal gauge (diffeomorphism) symmetry\u201d of\ngeneral relativity.\n\nThe second category concerns the question of which quantities in a\ngauge theory represent the \u201cphysically real\u201d properties.\nThis question arises acutely in gauge theories because of the apparent\nfailure of determinism if certain redundancies of description are not\ntaken into account in formulating the initial value problem. The\nproblem was first encountered in GTR (which in this respect is a gauge\ntheory), and for further details the best place to begin is with the\nliterature on Einstein\u2019s \u201chole argument\u201d (see Earman\nand Norton, 1987; Earman, 1989, Chapter 9; and more recently Norton,\n1993; Rynasiewicz, 1999; Saunders, 2002; Pooley, 2021; and the\nreferences therein). In practice, we find that only gauge-invariant\nquantities are observables, and this seems to rescue us. However, this\nis not the end of the story. The other canonical example is the\nAharanov-Bohm effect, and we can use this to illustrate the\ninterpretational problem associated with gauge theories, sometimes\ncharacterized as a dilemma: failure of determinism or\naction-at-a-distance (see Healey, 2001). Restoring determinism depends\non only gauge-invariant quantities being taken as representing\n\u201cphysically real\u201d quantities, but accepting this solution\napparently leaves us with some form of non-locality between causes and\neffects.\n\nFurthermore, we face the question of how to understand the role of the\nnon-gauge-invariant quantities appearing in the theory, and the\nproblem of how to interpret what M. Redhead calls \u201csurplus\nstructure\u201d (see Redhead, 2003). For an early discussion of\n\u201csurplus structure\u201d in the philosophical literature, see Belot\n(1998) and Nounou (2003). More recently, the topic of \u201csurplus\nstructure\u201d in gauge theories has been discussed in Weatherall\n(2016), Murray, Nguyen & Teh (2020), Gomes (2021),\nMurgueitio-Ramirez and Teh (forthcoming), Dougherty (2020) and Wallace\n(2022): the more recent discussion draws interesting connections\nbetween the discussion of gauge theory and cutting edge topics in\ntheoretical physics, e.g. the application of category theory to\nphysics, and the use of the covariant phase space formalism. For\nan approach to these questions using the theory of constrained\nHamiltonian systems, see also Earman (2003b), Castellani (2003, 2004),\nand Pitts (2014). For an intuitive characterization of gauge symmetry,\none that is more general than the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian\nformulations of theories in which gauge symmetry is usually\nexpressed, see Belot (2008). How best to interpret gauge theories is\nan open issue in the philosophy of physics. Healey (2007) discusses\nthe conceptual foundations of gauge theories, arguing in favour of a\nnon-separable holonomy interpretation of classical Yang-Mills gauge\ntheories of fundamental interactions. Catren (2008) tackles the\nontological implications of Yang-Mills theory by means of the fiber\nbundle formalism. Useful references are the Metascience review\nsymposium on Healey (2007) (Rickles, Smeenk, Lyre and Healey, 2009),\nand the \u201cSynopsis and Discussion\u201d of the workshop\n\u201cPhilosophy of Gauge Theory,\u201d Center for Philosophy of\nScience, University of Pittsburgh, 18\u201319 April 2009 (available\nonline). A recent, detailed overview and discussion of the\nvarious issues raised by the question of the status (both in\nphysics and in philosophy of physics) of gauge symmetries is provided\nin Berghofer, Fran\u00e7ois, Friederich, Gomes, Hetzroni, Maas, and\nSondenheimer (2023).\n2.6 Dualities\n\nThus far, we have been discussing symmetries which act on the space of\nstates of a physical theory. In recent years, much discussion within\nphysics and philosophy has centered on certain kinds of symmetries\nthat act on the space of theories. When such symmetries are\ninterpreted as realizing an \u201cequivalence\u201d (which sense is\nitself something that requires philosophical work to explicate)\nbetween two theories, the theories are typically said to be related by\na \u201cduality symmetry\u201d (and if we are speaking of\n\u201csymmetry\u201d in the strict sense of an automorphism, then\nsuch dualities are called \u201cself-dualities\u201d).\n\nThe dualities playing a central role in contemporary physics are of\nvarious types: dualities between quantum field theories (like the\ngeneralized electric-magnetic duality), between string theories (such\nas T-duality and S-duality), and between physical descriptions which\nare, respectively, a quantum field theory and a string theory, as in\nthe case of gauge/gravity dualities. Historically, the first\nrelevant dualities to be used in physics were electric-magnetic\nduality, momentum-position duality (via Fourier transform) \u2013\nwave-particle duality in the QM context \u2013 and the\nKramers-Wannier duality of the two-dimensional Ising model in\nstatistical physics. On the various types of dualities and their\nsignificance in physics, see in particular Castellani and Rickles\n(2017). An introductory review of gauge/gravity\nduality, emphasising the conceptual aspects, is De\nHaro, Mayerson, and Butterfield (2016). \n\nIn general, because dualities are transformations between theories,\ntheir implications are more radical than those of symmetry\ntransformations. While symmetries are mapping between the solutions of\nthe same theory, different theoretical descriptions can have very\ndifferent interpretations in terms of objects, properties, degrees of\nfreedom, and spacetime frameworks. Thus, dualities naturally offer a\nnew and interesting viewpoint on many traditional issues in the\nphilosophy of science, such as a)  reduction, emergence, and\nfundamentality (for a discussion of duality and emergence see, for\nexample, Rickles, 2013, and Castellani and De Haro, 2020); b)\ntheoretical equivalence and underdetermination (see Read\nand M\u00f8ller-Nielsen, 2020, on the import of duality\nfor these issues); and c) realism versus anti-realism (Le Bihan and\nRead, 2018, provide a survey of the landscape of possible\nontological interpretations of duality-related theories; a specific\nexample, is the case of the \u201cparticle\ndemocracy\u201d related to weak/strong dualities, as\ndiscussed in Castellani, 2017). A comprehensive discussion of the\nmany issues related to the physics and philosophy of\ndualities is De Haro and Butterfield (forthcoming).\n\nWithin the philosophical literature, work relating symmetries to\ndualities generally responds to one of the following three\nquestions:\n\nWhat is an appropriate formal framework for understanding the\ninter-theoretic relationship realized by duality symmetries? Within\nthe context of quantum gauge/gravity duality, a rudimentary framework\nfor doing so was sketched in De Haro, Teh, and Butterfield (2017) and\nthen further developed in De Haro and Butterfield (2017) for the case\nof bosonization dualities. A comprehensive, detailed survey is\nprovided in De Haro and Butterfield (2018). And within the far simpler\ncontext of classical mechanics, Teh and Tsementzis (2017) explore the\nuse of the quintessential symmetry of classical phase space (viz.\nsymplectomorphisms) to relate Hamiltonian and Lagrangian theories, and\nproceed to discuss how can use this framework as a toy model for\nthinking about more sophisticated dualities.\nWhat is the relationship between the local symmetry of a theory\nand the symmetries of its dual theory? One reason that this question\nis pressing is that (as we mentioned in Section 2.5), local symmetries\nare typically regard as \u201csurplus\u201d or\n\u201credundant\u201d structure of a theory; thus one might hope to\nbe able to construct a dual theory that does not contain such surplus\nstructure. Indeed, it was conjectured in Polchinski and Horowitz\n(2009) that for gravity/gauge duality, the local symmetries (i.e. the\ndiffeomorphisms) of the bulk theory will always be\n\u201cinvisible\u201d from the perspective of its dual boundary\ntheory. However, De Haro, Teh, and Butterfield (2017) argue that this\nconjecture is not true in full generality: there is a special class of\ndiffeomorphisms which do not vanish in the boundary theory, but\ninstead correspond to conformal transformations of the boundary\nCFT.\nShould duality symmetries themselves by understood as a certain\nkind of \u201cgauge symmetry\u201d, thus explaining why we should\ntreat dual theories as \u201cphysically equivalent\u201d? On this\nquestion, Read (2016) undertakes the task of using the \u201chole\nargument\u201d as a lens with which to compare string-theoretic\ndualities with (intra-theory) gauge symmetries.\n\n3. Symmetry Arguments\n\nConsider the following cases.\n\nBuridan\u2019s ass: situated between what are, for him, two\ncompletely equivalent bundles of hay, he has no reason to choose the\none located to his left over the one located to his right, and so he\nis not able to choose and dies of starvation.\nArchimedes\u2019s equilibrium law for the balance: if equal\nweights are hung at equal distances along the arms of a balance, then\nit will remain in equilibrium since there is no reason for it to\nrotate one way or the other about the balance point.\nAnaximander\u2019s argument for the immobility of the Earth as\nreported by Aristotle: the Earth remains at rest since, being at the\ncentre of the spherical cosmos (and in the same relation to the\nboundary of the cosmos in every direction), there is no reason why it\nshould move in one direction rather than another.\n\n\nWhat do they have in common?\n\nFirst, these can all be understood as examples of the application of\nthe Leibnizean Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR): if there is no\nsufficient reason for one thing to happen instead of another, the\nprinciple says that nothing happens (the initial situation does not\nchange). But there is something more that the above cases have in\ncommon: in each of them PSR is applied on the grounds that the initial\nsituation has a given symmetry: in the first two cases, bilateral\nsymmetry; in the third, rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the\ninitial situation implies the complete equivalence between the\nexisting alternatives (the left bundle of hay with respect to the\nright one, and so on). If the alternatives are completely equivalent,\nthen there is no sufficient reason for choosing between them and the\ninitial situation remains unchanged.\n\nArguments of the above kind \u2014 that is, arguments leading to\ndefinite conclusions on the basis of an initial symmetry of the\nsituation plus PSR \u2014 have been used in science since antiquity\n(as Anaximander\u2019s argument testifies). The form they most\nfrequently take is the following: a situation with a certain symmetry\nevolves in such a way that, in the absence of an asymmetric cause, the\ninitial symmetry is preserved. In other words, a breaking of the\ninitial symmetry cannot happen without a reason, or an asymmetry\ncannot originate spontaneously. Van Fraassen (1989) devotes a\nchapter to considering the way these kinds of symmetry arguments can\nbe used in general problem-solving.\n\nHistorically, the first explicit formulation of this kind of argument\nin terms of symmetry is due to the physicist Pierre Curie towards the\nend of nineteenth century. Curie was led to reflect on the question of\nthe relationship between physical properties and symmetry\nproperties of a physical system by his studies on the thermal,\nelectric and magnetic properties of crystals, these properties being\ndirectly related to the structure, and hence the symmetry, of the\ncrystals studied. More precisely, the question he addressed was the\nfollowing: in a given physical medium (for example, a crystalline\nmedium) having specified symmetry properties, which physical phenomena\n(for example, which electric and magnetic phenomena) are allowed to\nhappen? His conclusions, systematically presented in his 1894 work\n\u201cSur la sym\u00e9trie dans les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\nphysiques\u201d, can be synthesized as follows:\n\nA phenomenon can exist in a medium possessing its characteristic\nsymmetry or that of one of its subgroups. What is needed for its\noccurrence (i.e. for something rather than nothing to happen) is not\nthe presence, but rather the absence, of certain symmetries:\n\u201cAsymmetry is what creates a phenomenon\u201d.\nThe symmetry elements of the causes must be found in their\neffects, but the converse is not true; that is, the effects can be\nmore symmetric than the causes.\n\n\nConclusion (a) clearly indicates that Curie recognized the important\nfunction played by the concept of symmetry breaking in\nphysics (he was indeed one of the first to recognize it). Conclusion\n(b) is what is usually called \u201cCurie\u2019s principle\u201d in\nthe literature, although notice that (a) and (b) are not independent\nof one another.\n\nIn order for Curie\u2019s principle to be applicable, various\nconditions need to be satisfied: the causal connection must be valid,\nthe cause and effect must be well-defined, and the symmetries of both\nthe cause and the effect must also be well-defined (this involves both\nthe physical and the geometrical properties of the physical systems\nconsidered). Curie\u2019s principle then furnishes a necessary\ncondition for given phenomena to happen: only those phenomena can\nhappen that are compatible with the symmetry conditions established by\nthe principle.\n\nCurie\u2019s principle has thus an important methodological function:\non the one side, it furnishes a kind of selection rule (given an\ninitial situation with a specified symmetry, only certain phenomena\nare allowed to happen); on the other side, it offers a falsification\ncriterion for physical theories (a violation of Curie\u2019s\nprinciple may indicate that something is wrong in the physical\n description).[15]\n\nSuch applications of Curie\u2019s principle depend, of course, on our\naccepting its validity, and this is something that has been questioned\nin the literature, especially in relation to spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking (see below, next section). Different proposals have been\noffered for justifying the principle. We have presented it here as an\nexample of symmetry considerations based on Leibniz\u2019s PSR, while\nCurie himself seems to have regarded it as a form of the causality\nprinciple. In current literature, it has become standard to understand\nthe principle as following from the invariance properties of\ndeterministic physical laws. According to this \u201creceived\nview\u201d, as first formulated in Chalmers (1970) and then developed\nin more recent literature (Ismael 1997, Belot 2003, Earman 2004),\nCurie\u2019s principle is expressed in terms of the relationship\nbetween the symmetries of earlier and later states of a system, and\nthe laws connecting these states. In fact, this is a misrepresentation\nof Curie\u2019s original principle: Curie\u2019s focus was on the\ncase of co-existing, functionally related features of a system\u2019s\nstate, rather than temporally ordered cause and effect pairs. For a\ndiscussion on such questions as to whether there is more that one\n\u201cCurie\u2019s principle\u201d and, independently of how it is\nformulated, what are the aspects that make it so scientically\nfruitful, see Castellani and Ismael (2016). As regards the status\nof the principle, Norton (2016) argues that it is a\n\u201ctruism\u201d, on the grounds that whether the principle\nsucceeds or fails depends on how one chooses to attach causal labels\nto the scientific description. For Roberts (2013), Curie\u2019s\nprinciple fails when the symmetry is time reversal. Roberts (2016)\nclaims that the truth of the principle is contingent on special\nphysical facts, and attributes to its failure an important role in the\ndetection of parity violation and CP violation (on this point, see\nalso Roberts, 2015, and Ashtekar, 2015).\n4. Symmetry Breaking\n\nA symmetry can be exact, approximate, or broken. Exact means\nunconditionally valid; approximate means valid under certain\nconditions; broken can mean different things, depending on the object\nconsidered and its context.\n\nThe study of symmetry breaking also goes back to Pierre Curie.\nAccording to Curie, symmetry breaking has the following role: for the\noccurrence of a phenomenon in a medium, the original symmetry group of\nthe medium must be lowered (broken, in today\u2019s terminology) to\nthe symmetry group of the phenomenon (or to a subgroup of the\nphenomenon\u2019s symmetry group) by the action of some cause. In\nthis sense symmetry breaking is what \u201ccreates the\nphenomenon\u201d. Generally, the breaking of a certain symmetry does\nnot imply that no symmetry is present, but rather that the situation\nwhere this symmetry is broken is characterized by a lower symmetry\nthan the original one. In group-theoretic terms, this means that the\ninitial symmetry group is broken to one of its subgroups. It is\ntherefore possible to describe symmetry breaking in terms of relations\nbetween transformation groups, in particular between a group (the\nunbroken symmetry group) and its subgroup(s). As is clearly\nillustrated in the 1992 volume by I. Stewart and M. Golubitsky,\nstarting from this point of view a general theory of symmetry breaking\ncan be developed by tackling such questions as \u201cwhich subgroups\ncan occur?\u201d, \u201cwhen does a given subgroup occur?\u201d\n\nSymmetry breaking was first explicitly studied in physics with respect\nto physical objects and phenomena. This is not surprising, since the\ntheory of symmetry originated with the visible symmetry properties of\nfamiliar spatial figures and every day objects. However, it is with\nrespect to the laws that symmetry breaking has acquired special\nsignificance in physics. There are two different types of symmetry\nbreaking of the laws: \u201cexplicit\u201d and\n\u201cspontaneous\u201d, the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking\nbeing the more interesting from a physical as well as a philosophical\npoint of view.\n4.1 Explicit symmetry breaking\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking indicates a situation where the dynamical\nequations are not manifestly invariant under the symmetry group\nconsidered. This means, in the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) formulation,\nthat the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) of the system contains one or more\nterms explicitly breaking the symmetry. Such terms can have different\norigins:\n\n(a) Symmetry-breaking terms may be introduced into the theory by hand\non the basis of theoretical/experimental results, as in the case of\nthe quantum field theory of the weak interactions, which is expressly\nconstructed in a way that manifestly violates mirror symmetry or\nparity. The underlying result, in this case, is parity\nnon-conservation in the case of the weak interaction, first predicted\nin the famous (Nobel-prize winning) 1956 paper by T. D. Lee and C.N.\nYang.\n\n(b) Symmetry-breaking terms may appear in the theory because of\nquantum-mechanical effects. One reason for the presence of such terms\n\u2014 known as \u201canomalies\u201d \u2014 is that in passing\nfrom the classical to the quantum level, because of possible operator\nordering ambiguities for composite quantities such as Noether charges\nand currents, it may be that the classical symmetry algebra (generated\nthrough the Poisson bracket structure) is no longer realized in terms\nof the commutation relations of the Noether charges. Moreover, the use\nof a \u201cregulator\u201d (or \u201ccut-off\u201d) required in\nthe renormalization procedure to achieve actual calculations may\nitself be a source of anomalies. It may violate a symmetry of the\ntheory, and traces of this symmetry breaking may remain even after the\nregulator is removed at the end of the calculations. Historically, the\nfirst example of an anomaly arising from renormalization is the\nso-called chiral anomaly, that is the anomaly violating the chiral\nsymmetry of the strong interaction (see Weinberg, 1996, Chapter\n22).\n\n(c) Finally, symmetry-breaking terms may appear because of\nnon-renormalizable effects. Physicists now have good reasons for\nviewing current renormalizable field theories as effective field\ntheories, that is low-energy approximations to a deeper theory\n(each effective theory explicitly referring only to those particles\nthat are of importance at the range of energies considered). The\neffects of non-renormalizable interactions (due to the heavy particles\nnot included in the theory) are small and can therefore be ignored at\nthe low-energy regime. It may then happen that the coarse-grained\ndescription thus obtained possesses more symmetries than the deeper\ntheory. That is, the effective Lagrangian obeys symmetries that are\nnot symmetries of the underlying theory. These\n\u201caccidental\u201d symmetries, as Weinberg has called them, may\nthen be violated by the non-renormalizable terms arising from higher\nmass scales and suppressed in the effective Lagrangian (see Weinberg,\n1995, pp. 529\u2013531).\n4.2 Spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs in a situation where, given\na symmetry of the equations of motion, solutions exist which are not\ninvariant under the action of this symmetry without any explicit\nasymmetric input (whence the attribute\n \u201cspontaneous\u201d).[16]\n A situation of this type can be first illustrated by means of simple\ncases taken from classical physics. Consider for example the case of a\nlinear vertical stick with a compression force applied on the top and\ndirected along its axis. The physical description is obviously\ninvariant for all rotations around this axis. As long as the applied\nforce is mild enough, the stick does not bend and the equilibrium\nconfiguration (the lowest energy configuration) is invariant under\nthis symmetry. When the force reaches a critical value, the symmetric\nequilibrium configuration becomes unstable and an infinite number of\nequivalent lowest energy stable states appear, which are no longer\nrotationally symmetric but are related to each other by a rotation.\nThe actual breaking of the symmetry may then easily occur by effect of\na (however small) external asymmetric cause, and the stick bends until\nit reaches one of the infinite possible stable asymmetric equilibrium\n configurations.[17]\n In substance, what happens in the above kind of situation is the\nfollowing: when some parameter reaches a critical value, the lowest\nenergy solution respecting the symmetry of the theory ceases to be\nstable under small perturbations and new asymmetric (but stable)\nlowest energy solutions appear. The new lowest energy solutions are\nasymmetric but are all related through the action of the symmetry\ntransformations. In other words, there is a degeneracy (infinite or\nfinite depending on whether the symmetry is continuous or discrete) of\ndistinct asymmetric solutions of identical (lowest) energy, the whole\nset of which maintains the symmetry of the theory.\n\nIn quantum physics SSB actually does not occur in the case of\nfinite systems: tunnelling takes place between the various degenerate\nstates, and the true lowest energy state or \u201cground state\u201d\nturns out to be a unique linear superposition of the degenerate\nstates. In fact, SSB is applicable only to infinite systems \u2014\nmany-body systems (such as ferromagnets, superfluids and\nsuperconductors) and fields \u2014 the alternative degenerate ground\nstates being all orthogonal to each other in the infinite volume limit\nand therefore separated by a \u201csuperselection rule\u201d (see\nfor example Weinberg, 1996, pp. 164\u2013165).\n\nHistorically, the concept of SSB first emerged in condensed matter\nphysics. The prototype case is the 1928 Heisenberg theory of the\nferromagnet as an infinite array of spin 1/2 magnetic dipoles, with\nspin-spin interactions between nearest neighbours such that\nneighbouring dipoles tend to align. Although the theory is\nrotationally invariant, below the critical Curie temperature\nTc the actual ground state of the\nferromagnet has the spin all aligned in some particular direction\n(i.e. a magnetization pointing in that direction), thus not respecting\nthe rotational symmetry. What happens is that below\nTc there exists an infinitely degenerate\nset of ground states, in each of which the spins are all aligned in a\ngiven direction. A complete set of quantum states can be built upon\neach ground state. We thus have many different \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d (sets of solutions to the same equations), each one\nbuilt on one of the possible orthogonal (in the infinite volume limit)\nground states. To use a famous image by S. Coleman, a little man\nliving inside one of these possible asymmetric worlds would have a\nhard time detecting the rotational symmetry of the laws of nature (all\nhis experiments being under the effect of the background magnetic\nfield). The symmetry is still there \u2014 the Hamiltonian being\nrotationally invariant \u2014 but \u201chidden\u201d to the little\nman. Besides, there would be no way for the little man to detect\ndirectly that the ground state of his world is part of an infinitely\ndegenerate multiplet. To go from one ground state of the infinite\nferromagnet to another would require changing the directions of an\ninfinite number of dipoles, an impossible task for the finite little\nman (Coleman, 1975, pp. 141\u2013142). As said, in the infinite\nvolume limit all ground states are separated by a superselection rule.\nRuetsche (2006) discusses symmetry breaking and ferromagnetism from\nthe algebraic perspective. Liu and Emch (2005) address the\ninterpretative problems of explaining SSB in nonrelativistic quantum\nstatistical mechanics. Fraser (2016) discusses SBB in finite systems,\narguing against the indispensability of the thermodynamic limit in the\ncharacterization of SSB in statistical mechanics.\n\nThe same picture can be generalized to quantum field theory\n(QFT), the ground state becoming the vacuum state, and the\nrole of the little man being played by ourselves. This means that\nthere may exist symmetries of the laws of nature which are not\nmanifest to us because the physical world in which we live is built on\na vacuum state which is not invariant under them. In other words, the\nphysical world of our experience can appear to us very asymmetric, but\nthis does not necessarily mean that this asymmetry belongs to the\nfundamental laws of nature. SSB offers a key for understanding (and\nutilizing) this physical possiblity.\n\nThe concept of SSB was transferred from condensed matter physics to\nQFT in the early 1960s, thanks especially to works by Y. Nambu and G.\nJona-Lasinio. Jona-Lasinio (2003) offers a first-hand account of how\nthe idea of SSB was introduced and formalized in particle physics on\nthe grounds of an analogy with the breaking of (electromagnetic) gauge\nsymmetry in the 1957 theory of superconductivity by J. Bardeen, L. N.\nCooper and J. R. Schrieffer (the so-called BCS theory). The\napplication of SSB to particle physics in the 1960s and successive\nyears led to profound physical consequences and played a fundamental\nrole in the edification of the current Standard Model of elementary\nparticles. In particular, let us mention the following main results\nthat obtain in the case of the spontaneous breaking of a continous\ninternal symmetry in QFT.\n\nGoldstone theorem. In the case of a global continuous\nsymmetry, massless bosons (known as \u201cGoldstone bosons\u201d)\nappear with the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry according to a\ntheorem first stated by J. Goldstone in 1960. The presence of these\nmassless bosons, first seen as a serious problem since no particles of\nthe sort had been observed in the context considered, was in fact the\nbasis for the solution \u2014 by means of the so-called Higgs\nmechanism (see the next point) \u2014 of another similar problem,\nthat is the fact that the 1954 Yang-Mills theory of non-Abelian gauge\nfields predicted unobservable massless particles, the gauge\nbosons.\n\nHiggs mechanism. According to a \u201cmechanism\u201d\nestablished in a general way in 1964 independently by (i) P. Higgs,\n(ii) R. Brout and F. Englert, and (iii) G. S. Guralnik, C. R. Hagen\nand T. W. B. Kibble, in the case that the internal symmetry is\npromoted to a local one, the Goldstone bosons \u201cdisappear\u201d\nand the gauge bosons acquire a mass. The Goldstone bosons are\n\u201ceaten up\u201d to give mass to the gauge bosons, and this\nhappens without (explicitly) breaking the gauge invariance of the\ntheory. Note that this mechanism for the mass generation for the gauge\nfields is also what ensures the renormalizability of theories\ninvolving massive gauge fields (such as the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam\nelectroweak theory developed in the second half of the 1960s), as\nfirst generally demonstrated by M. Veltman and G. \u2019t Hooft in\nthe early 1970s. The Higgs mechanism it at the center of a lively\ndebate among philosophers of physics: see, for example, Smeenk\n(2006), Lyre (2008), Struyve (2011), Friederich (2013).\nFor a historical-philosophical analysis, see also Borrelli (2012). A\ndetailed discussion of the foundational and interpretational issues\nraised by the Higgs mechanism is provided in Berghofer,\nFran\u00e7ois, Friederich, Gomes, Hetzroni, Maas, and Sondenheimer\n(2023, 3.3).\n\nDynamical symmetry breaking (DSB). In such theories as the\nunified model of electroweak interactions, the SSB responsible (via\nthe Higgs mechanism) for the masses of the gauge vector bosons is\nbecause of the symmetry-violating vacuum expectation values of scalar\nfields (the so-called Higgs fields) introduced ad hoc in the\ntheory. For different reasons \u2014 first of all, the initially\nad hoc character of these scalar fields for which there was\nno experimental evidence until the results obtained in July 2012 at\nthe LHC \u2014 some attention has been drawn to the possibility that\nthe Higgs fields could be phenomenological rather than fundamental,\nthat is bound states resulting from a specified dynamical mechanism.\nSSB realized in this way has been called\n \u201cDSB\u201d.[18]\n\nSymmetry breaking raises a number of philosophical issues.\nSome of them relate only to the breaking of specific types of\nsymmetries, such as the issue of the significance of parity violation\nfor the problem of the nature of space (see\n Section 2.4,\n above). Others, for example the connection between symmetry breaking\nand observability, are particular aspects of the general issue\nconcerning the status and significance of physical symmetries, but in\nthe case of SSB they take on a stronger force: what is the\nepistemological status of a theory based on \u201chidden\u201d\nsymmetries and SSB? Given that what we directly observe \u2014 the\nphysical situation, the phenomenon \u2014 is asymmetric, what is the\nevidence for the \u201cunderlying\u201d symmetry? On this point, see\nfor example Morrison (2003) and Kosso (2000). In the absence of direct\nempirical evidence, the above question then becomes whether and how\nfar the predictive and explanatory power of theories based on SSB\nprovides good reasons for believing in the existence of the hidden\nsymmetries. Finally, there are issues raised by the motivation for,\nand role of, SSB. See for example Earman (2003a), using the algebraic\nformulation of QFT to explain SSB; for further philosophical\ndiscussions on SBB in QFT in the algebraic approach, see Ruetsche\n(2011), Fraser (2012), and references therein. Landsman (2013)\ndiscusses the issue whether SBB in infinite quantum systems can be\nseen as an example of asymptotic emergence in physics. Roberts (2022,\n4.5.4) argues that SBB provides an example of spacetime symmetries\nthat fail to be dynamical symmetries, contra a famous\nprinciple of Earman (1989, 3.4). \n\nSSB allows symmetric theories to describe asymmetric reality. In\nshort, SSB provides a way of understanding the complexity of nature\nwithout renouncing fundamental symmetries. But why should we prefer\nsymmetric to asymmetric fundamental laws? In other words, why assume\nthat an observed asymmetry requires a cause, which can be an explicit\nbreaking of the symmetry of the laws, asymmetric initial conditions,\nor SSB? Note that this assumption is very similar to the one expressed\nby Curie in his famous 1894 paper. Curie\u2019s principle (the\nsymmetries of the causes must be found in the effects; or,\nequivalently, the asymmetries of the effects must be found in the\ncauses), when extended to include the case of SSB, is equivalent to a\nmethodological principle according to which an asymmetry of the\nphenomena must come from the breaking (explicit or spontaneous) of the\nsymmetry of the fundamental laws. What the real nature of this\nprinciple is remains an open issue, at the centre of a developing\ndebate (see\n Section 3,\n above).\n\nFinally, let us mention the argument that is sometimes made in the\nliterature that SSB implies that Curie\u2019s principle is violated\nbecause a symmetry is broken \u201cspontaneously\u201d, that is\nwithout the presence of any asymmetric cause. Now it is true that SSB\nindicates a situation where solutions exist that are not invariant\nunder the symmetry of the law (dynamical equation) without any\nexplicit breaking of this symmetry. But, as we have seen, the symmetry\nof the \u201ccause\u201d is not lost, it is conserved in the\nensemble of the solutions (the whole\n \u201ceffect\u201d).[19]\n5. General Philosophical Questions\n\nMuch of the recent philosophical literature on symmetries in physics\ndiscusses specific symmetries and the intepretational questions they\nlead to. The rich variety of symmetries in modern physics means that\nquestions concerning the status and significance of symmetries in\nphysics in general are not easily addressed. However, something can be\nsaid in more general terms and we offer a few remarks in that\ndirection here, starting with the main roles that symmetry plays in\nphysics.\n\nOne of the most important roles played by symmetry is that of\nclassification \u2014 for example, the classification of\ncrystals using their remarkable and varied symmetry properties. In\ncontemporary physics, the best example of this role of symmetry is the\nclassification of elementary particles by means of the irreducible\nrepresentations of the fundamental physical symmetry groups, a result\nfirst obtained by Wigner in his famous paper of 1939 on the unitary\nrepresentations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. When a symmetry\nclassification includes all the necessary properties for\ncharacterizing a given type of physical object (for example, all\nnecessary quantum numbers for characterizing a given type of\nparticle), we have the possibility of defining types of entities on\nthe basis of their transformation properties. This has led\nphilosophers of science to explore a structuralist approach to the\nentities of modern physics, in particular a group-theoretical account\nof objects (see the contributions in Castellani, 1998, Part II). The\nrelation between symmetry, group and structure and its exploitation in\nstructuralist approaches, especially in the framework of structural\nrealism, is a much debated issue. See, for example, Roberts (2011),\nFrench (2014) and Caulton (2015), and the SEP entry\n Structural Realism.\n\nSymmetries also have a normative role, being used as\nconstraints on physical theories. The requirement of invariance with\nrespect to a transformation group imposes severe restrictions on the\nform that a theory may take, limiting the types of quantities that may\nappear in the theory as well as the form of its fundamental equations.\nA famous case is Einstein\u2019s use of general covariance when\nsearching for his gravitational equations.\n\nThe group-theoretical treatment of physical symmetries, with the\nresulting possibility of unifying different types of symmetries by\nmeans of a unification of the corresponding transformation groups, has\nprovided the technical resources for symmetry to play a powerful role\nin theoretical unification. This is best illustrated by the\ncurrent dominant research programme in theoretical physics aimed at\narriving at a unified description of all the fundamental forces of\nnature (gravitational, weak, electromagnetic and strong) in terms of\nunderlying local symmetry groups.\n\nIt is often said that many physical phenomena can be explained as\n(more or less direct) consequences of symmetry principles or symmetry\narguments. In the case of symmetry principles, the\nexplanatory role of symmetries arises from their place in the\nhierarchy of the structure of physical theory, which in turn derives\nfrom their generality. As Wigner (1967, pp. 28ff) describes the\nhierarchy, symmetries are seen as properties of the laws. Symmetries\nmay be used to explain (i) the form of the laws, and (ii) the\noccurrence (or non-occurrence) of certain events (this latter in a\nmanner analogous to the way in which the laws explain why certain\nevents occur and not others). In the case of symmetry arguments, we\nmay, for example, appeal to Curie\u2019s principle to explain the\noccurrence of certain phenomena on the basis of the symmetries (or\nasymmetries) of the situation, as discussed in section 3, above.\nFurthermore, insofar as explanatory power may be derived from\nunification, the unifying role of symmetries also results in an\nexplanatory role.\n\nFrom these different roles we can draw some preliminary conclusions\nabout the status of symmetries. It is immediately apparent that\nsymmetries have an important heuristic function, indicating a strong\nmethodological status. Is this methodological power connected to an\nontological or epistemological status for symmetries?\n\nAccording to an ontological viewpoint, symmetries are seen as\na substantial part of the physical world: the symmetries of theories\nrepresent properties existing in nature, or characterize the structure\nof the physical world. It might be claimed that the ontological status\nof symmetries provides the reason for the methodological success of\nsymmetries in physics. A concrete example is the use of symmetries to\npredict the existence of new particles. This can happen via the\nclassificatory role, on the grounds of vacant places in symmetry\nclassification schemes, as in the famous case of the 1962 prediction\nof the particle Omega- in the context of the hadronic\nclassification scheme known as the \u201cEightfold Way\u201d. (See\nBangu, 2008, for a critical analysis of the reasoning leading to this\nprediction.) Or, as in more recent cases, via the unificatory role:\nthe paradigmatic example is the prediction of the W and\nZ particles (experimentally found in 1983) in the context of\nthe Glashow-Weinberg-Salam gauge theory proposed in 1967 for the\nunification of the weak and electromagnetic interactions. These\nimpressive cases of the prediction of new phenomena might then be used\nto argue for an ontological status for symmetries, via an inference to\nthe best explanation.\n\nAnother reason for attributing symmetries to nature is the so-called\ngeometrical interpretation of spatiotemporal symmetries, according to\nwhich the spatiotemporal symmetries of physical laws are interpreted\nas symmetries of spacetime itself, the \u201cgeometrical\nstructure\u201d of the physical world. Moreover, this way of seeing\nsymmetries can be extended to non-external symmetries, by considering\nthem as properties of other kinds of spaces, usually known as\n\u201cinternal spaces\u201d. The question of exactly what a realist\nwould be committed to on such a view of internal spaces remains open,\nand an interesting topic for discussion.\n\nOne approach to investigating the limits of an ontological stance with\nrespect to symmetries would be to investigate their empirical or\nobservational status: can the symmetries in question be directly\nobserved? We first have to address what it means for a symmetry to be\nobservable, and indeed whether all symmetries have the same\nobservational status. Kosso (2000) arrives at the conclusion that\nthere are important differences in the empirical status of the\ndifferent kinds of symmetries. In particular, while global continuous\nsymmetries can be directly observed \u2014 via such experiments as\nthe Galilean ship experiment \u2014 a local continuous symmetry can\nhave only indirect empirical evidence.  Brading and Brown (2004)\nargue for a different interpretation of Kosso\u2019s\n examples,[20]\n but agree with Kosso\u2019s assessment that local symmetry\ntransformations cannot exhibit an analogue of the Galileo\u2019s Ship\nExperiment. Against this view, Greaves and Wallace (2014) and Teh\n(2016) have recently argued that when suitably understood, local\nsymmetries can indeed have direct empirical significance (their\nargument turns on the possibility of using asymptotically non-trivial\nlocal symmetries to construct Galileo\u2019s Ship scenarios for\ncertain systems). In particular, Teh (2016) argues that this\nphenomenon is responsible for the empirically significant symmetries\nof topological soliton solutions. In a similar spirit, Gomes (2021)\nargues that a certain class of gauge transformations are on a par with\nGalileo\u2019s Ship, under special conditions, and that those conditions\nimply a certain kind of holism in the sense that the state of the\nUniverse is not uniquely determined by the state of its isolated\nsubsystems. On the other hand, Friederich (2015) contends that on\none plausible axiomatization of the schema introduced by Greaves and\nWallace, it is possible to deduce that local symmetries do not have\ndirect empirical significance. This debate was recently expanded by\nRoberts (2022, 4.3) to include discrete symmetry transformations like\ntime reversal. Roberts argues that these symmetries have direct\nempirical significance, but at a\n\u201chigher-order\u201d level, that derives from the direct\nempirical significance of spacetime translations.\n\nThe direct observational status of the familiar global spacetime\nsymmetries leads us to an epistemological aspect of\nsymmetries. According to Wigner, the spatiotemporal invariance\nprinciples play the role of a prerequisite for the very possibility of\ndiscovering the laws of nature: \u201cif the correlations between\nevents changed from day to day, and would be different for different\npoints of space, it would be impossible to discover them\u201d\n(Wigner, 1967, p. 29). For Wigner, this conception of symmetry\nprinciples is essentially related to our ignorance (if we could\ndirectly know all the laws of nature, we would not need to use\nsymmetry principles in our search for them). Others, on the contrary,\nhave arrived at a view according to which symmetry principles function\nas \u201ctranscendental principles\u201d in the Kantian sense (see\nfor instance Mainzer, 1996). It should be noted in this regard that\nWigner\u2019s starting point, as quoted above, does not imply exact\nsymmetries \u2014 all that is needed epistemologically is that the\nglobal symmetries hold approximately, for suitable spatiotemporal\nregions, such that there is sufficient stability and regularity in the\nevents for the laws of nature to be discovered.\n\nThere is another reason why symmetries might be seen as being\nprimarily epistemological. As we have mentioned, there is a close\nconnection between the notions of symmetry and equivalence, and this\nleads also to a notion of irrelevance: the equivalence of space points\n(translational symmetry), for example, may be understood in the sense\nof the irrelevance of an absolute position to the physical\ndescription. There are two ways that one might interpret the\nepistemological significance of this: on the one hand, we might say\nthat symmetries are associated with unavoidable redundancy in our\ndescriptions of the world, while on the other hand we might\nmaintain that symmetries indicate a limitation of our epistemic access\n\u2014 there are certain properties of objects, such as their\nabsolute positions, that are not observable. The view that symmetries\nare connected with the presence of non-observable quantities in the\nphysical description, with the corollary that the empirical violation\nof a symmetry is intended in the sense that what was thought to be a\nnon-observable turns out to be actually an observable, was\nparticularly defended by one of the discover of parity violation, T.D.\nLee (see section 2.4). According to Lee (1981), \u201cthe root of all\nsymmetry principles lies in the assumption that it is impossible to\nobserve certain basic quantities\u201d (p. 178). See on this (and,\nmore generally, on the relation between symmetry, equivalence and\nirrelevance) Castellani (2003). Dasgupta (2016) defends an epistemic\ninterpretation of symmetry on a similar basis as Lee, that he calls\nthe \u201csymmetry to reality inference\u201d. In contrast,\nRoberts (2022, 4.4) argues that the symmetry to reality inference is\nnot generally valid.\n\nFinally, we would like to mention an aspect of symmetry that might\nvery naturally be used to support either an ontological or an\nepistemological account. It is widely agreed that there is a close\nconnection between symmetry and objectivity, the starting\npoint once again being provided by spacetime symmetries: the laws by\nmeans of which we describe the evolution of physical systems have an\nobjective validity because they are the same for all observers. The\nold and natural idea that what is objective should not depend upon the\nparticular perspective under which it is taken into consideration is\nthus reformulated in the following group-theoretical terms: what is\nobjective is what is invariant with respect to the transformation\ngroup of reference frames, or, quoting Hermann Weyl (1952, p. 132),\n\u201cobjectivity means invariance with respect to the group of\nautomorphisms [of\n space-time]\u201d.[21]\n Debs and Redhead (2007) label as \u201cinvariantism\u201d the view\nthat \u201cinvariance under a specified group of automorphisms is\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for objectivity\u201d (p.\n60). They point out (p. 73, and see also p. 66) that there is a\nnatural connection between \u201cinvariantism\u201d and structural\nrealism.\n\nGrowing interest, recently, in the metaphysics of physics includes\ninterest in symmetries. Baker (2010) offers an accessible\nintroduction, and Livanios (2010), connecting discussions of\nsymmetries to dispositions and essences, is an example of this\nwork.\n\nTo conclude: symmetries in physics offer many interpretational\npossibilities, and how to understand the status and significance of\nphysical symmetries clearly presents a challenge to both physicists\nand philosophers. A recent, comprehensive survey of the\nphilosophy of symmetry is Teh forthcoming.\n",
