    "main_text": "Constitutional Patriotism, Cosmopolitanism, and International Law || Cosmopolitanism and the Constitutionalization of International Law\n6.2 Cosmopolitanism and the Constitutionalization of International Law\n\nHabermas\u2019s views on international politics are characterised by\na revision of Kant\u2019s cosmopolitanism, and a total rejection of\nCarl Schmitt\u2019s conception of the political as irreducibly\nantagonistic (1996a essay 7 [1998a: 193\u2013201]; 2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 188\u201393]). After some early explorations (1996a essay 7\n[1998a]), he rejects a Kantian version of cosmopolitanism, arguing for\na \u201cpolitically constituted world society\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 161]) rather than a world republic or a global federation. His\nfocus is the \u201cconstitutionalization of international law\u201d\n(2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 132\u20135]) without a world\ngovernment, with the limited aims of ensuring peace and protecting\nhuman rights, rather than democracy on a global scale. Habermas pays\nparticular attention to the different types of legitimation which\ndifferent levels of global governance would require, and the different\ntypes of constitution they would need.\n\nIn Perpetual Peace, Kant looks forward to the transformation\nof international law, with states as its subjects, into cosmopolitan\nlaw, with global citizens as its subjects. Habermas, in contrast,\nargues that cosmopolitan law must be dualistic, with both states\nand individuals as its subjects. The cosmopolitan community\nis dualistic in the sense that it is a community of both human beings\n(individual subjects), and states (collective subjects) (2004 chapter\n8 [2006c: 135]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 317]). Both can act as the\nfounding subjects of a world constitution (2009 chapter 7: 119; 2011\n[2012: 58]).\n\nHabermas describes \u201ca multilevel political system that does not\nassume a state-like character as a whole\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 144]), divided into three levels (2005b chapter 11 [2008a:\n322\u20137]), each with its own form of legitimation and type of\nconstitution:\n\nNational: nation states (2009 chapter 7:\n115\u20136). Although they are no longer fully sovereign in a\nglobalized world, states still have the monopoly on the use of force\nwithin their territories. They are based on a defined self-legislating\ndemos (\u201cnational\u201d or otherwise), which gives itself laws\nby following democratic procedures, thus linking the rule of law to\ndemocracy. In other words, states have a more \u201crepublican\u201d\ntype of constitution, which gives a central role to popular\nsovereignty established in a revolutionary moment (1998d [2001a:\n116\u20138]; 2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 122]). They can have full\ndemocratic legitimacy, as described in Between Facts and\nNorms, since within a state the authors of law can also be its\naddressees (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 141]). States have the highest\nrequirements of legitimacy within Habermas\u2019s model. They have\ntwo functions: firstly, to provide military force for implementing\nhuman rights and policy decisions of the higher levels (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 320\u2013321]), and secondly, to generate indirect\npolitical legitimacy for the higher levels.\nTransnational: continental blocs like the EU,\nHabermas\u2019s prime example of a transnational polity, along with\nits less-integrated siblings such as ASEAN and Mercosur (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 325\u20136]). Great powers such as the USA, China, Russia,\nand India also operate at the transnational level (2009 chapter 7:\n114), as do economic organizations such as the WTO, IMF, and World\nBank; and UN agencies such as the WHO and UNESCO (2011 [2012: 56]).\nThis is the most \u201cpluralist\u201d level in Habermas\u2019s\nmodel, since it contains very different types of polities, and\nincludes ones which are both liberal and illiberal, democratic and\nnon-democratic. At the transnational level there exists a\n\u201cglobal domestic politics\u201d (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136,\n160]) addressing socioeconomic questions. Issues of wealth and\nredistribution, health and disease, trade, migration, and\nenvironmental policy can be discussed within and between transnational\npolities. Habermas still considers relations in and between them to\ncount as international relations or foreign policy, although recourse\nto war should be ruled out (2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 325]). The\nnormative yardstick for relations between transnational polities is\nfair negotiation, not the full democratic legitimacy which can exist\nwithin states (2009 chapter 7: 125\u20136; 2011 [2012: 57, 68]). They\nare nonetheless open to the influence of deliberative publics from\nbelow, and should institutionalize some degree of citizen\nparticipation, via referenda or mechanisms for responding to\ntransnational public spheres. Transnational polities also receive some\nindirect legitimation in virtue of their member states being\nlegitimate (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 142]). They thus have middling\nrequirements of legitimacy, which can be generated in a number of\ndirect and indirect ways, and may have several different types of\nconstitutions.\nSupranational: global organizations with\nuniversal membership, comprising both individuals and states as\nmembers. Habermas envisages a reformed United Nations as the central\ncomponent of the supranational layer, along with a stronger version of\nthe International Criminal Court (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 133\u20134,\n173\u20134]). Their remit is strictly to secure peace and prevent\nhuman rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136]; 2005b chapter 11\n[2008a: 322]; 2011 [2012: 60\u20131]), with the security council\nperforming an executive function, the ICC a judicial function, and the\nUN Charter acting as a supranational constitution (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 160\u20131]; 2009 chapter 7: 120). A reformed General\nAssembly could function as a world parliament, containing\nrepresentatives of both states and cosmopolitan citizens (2009 chapter\n7: 120\u20131), with its deliberations focused on interpreting and\nelaborating the meaning of the Charter, rather than the kind of\npolitical will-formation which takes place within national parliaments\n(2011 [2012: 60\u20131, 65]). All other cross-border political issues\nshould be dealt with at the transnational level\u2014the\nsupranational level is the preserve of law, rather than politics\n(2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 333\u20134, 343]; 2011 [2012: 65]).\n\n\nThis division of labour has drawn criticism, with Cristina Lafont\narguing that the relegation of all socioeconomic issues to the\ntransnational layer ensures that human rights violations stemming from\nglobal inequality cannot be addressed (Lafont 2008). Habermas\u2019s\nsuggestion that the \u201cslender but robust\u201d cross-cultural\nconsensus on basic human rights is enough to legitimate the\nsupranational level\u2019s policies (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 143];\n2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343\u20134]) has also been criticized. There\nis room for doubt on this point, especially with regard to contentious\ncases such as LGBT rights (1998d [2001a: 113\u2013129]; Scheuerman\n2008: 143\u20135).\n\nSince it is neither democratic nor a state, the supranational level\nhas the lowest requirements of legitimacy (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\n133\u20134, 143]; 2011 [2012: 65]), and is not suited to a republican\ntype of constitution, contra Kant. It is suited to a liberal type of\nconstitution, which prioritizes the rule of law rather than popular\nsovereignty (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137\u20139]). A liberal\nconstitution constrains established power in accordance with human\nrights, but does not connect it to the will of a self-legislating\ndemos, which is in any case lacking at the global level (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 316]). Instead, the supranational level derives its\nlegitimacy directly from the negative duties which it enforces (to\nprevent human rights abuses and wars of aggression), and indirectly\nfrom the legitimacy of the states which comprise it (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 140\u20131, 143]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 342\u20134]).\nThis may be supplemented by the periodic emergence of a global public\nsphere, mobilised in opposition to wars of aggression or in\ncondemnation of gross human rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\n142]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343\u20134]; 2009 chapter 7:\n124\u20135).\n\nIn this model, supranational law is to have primacy over state law, in\nmuch the same way that EU law has primacy over the laws of member\nstates (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137]). The plausibility of\nHabermas\u2019s proposals depends on two learning processes.\nIndividuals must learn to think and act as both national and\ncosmopolitan citizens, switching between a perspective that centres\nnational interest and one that centres universal standards of justice\n(2009 chapter 7: 116\u20138), while states must learn to regard\nthemselves as members of an international community, not absolute\nsovereigns (2011 [2012: 61]). Habermas regards the\nconstitutionalization of international law as the \u201clegal\ndomestication of the intensified cooperation between states\u201d\n(2014: 8), by which the Hobbesian state of nature at the global level\ncan be gradually regulated and subject to law without the need for a\nglobal government, which could not in any case be fully legitimate.\nSome degree of global governance is unavoidable in the contemporary\npostnational constellation. What is crucial is that it should be\nconstitutional and grounded in universal moral principles, rather than\na technocracy at the service of neoliberal capitalism.\n",
