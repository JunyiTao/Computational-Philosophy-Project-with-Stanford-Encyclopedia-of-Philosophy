    "main_text": "Philosophy of Money\n6. Philosophy of Money\n\nA cornerstone of monetary theory, and arguably the most robust and\nenduring law in economics, is the quantity theory of money that\ncommits to a causal and positive function between the price level and\nthe money supply, treating the latter as the independent variable,\nthat is, \\(P = f(M^s)\\) (see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020:\n151\u2013172). With the influx of silver from Latin America after\nColumbus, the money supply in Europe had more than doubled by 1510.\nWhile entering exclusively on Spanish ships, it spread rapidly, first\nto the Netherlands and then across Europe. Prices rose as well,\nalthough the underlying factors were not readily understood. Most\npurchases were of food, whose prices fluctuated with the harvests,\ngood and bad. Consumer durables tended to be purchased infrequently,\noften at seasonal fairs, which had complex systems for price\nnegotiations, pitching and haggling. The rise of middlemen, wholesale\nmarkets and retailing, became more prevalent in the seventeenth\ncentury, although the public was suspicious that these traders who\nlived well off their earnings were the cause of increasing prices.\nAlthough newspapers and broadsides posted prices, starting in the late\nseventeenth century, urban shopping still required negotiation. It was\nonly with the department stores of the late nineteenth century that\nprices were routinely posted.\n\nPause and reflect on how difficult it would be to discern inflation in\nthe early modern period, or perhaps even at present, and thus how\nbrilliant was the insight that the overall price level is a function\nof the money supply. In the 1520s, the Prussian Diet commissioned none\nother than Nicholas Copernicus to investigate the recent increase in\nprice instability. Drawing on his skills with handling large\nquantities of data, Copernicus\u2019s Monetae cudendae ratio\n(1526) established the proposition that the value of the currency (its\npurchasing power) had diminished due to its abundance. We thus have\nthe first inkling of a principle that is, in some respects, as central\nto economics as the principle of inertia is in physics.\n\nOthers in the second half of the sixteenth century, notably Navarrus,\nLuis de Molina, and Jean Bodin, arrived independently at a variant of\nthe quantity theory of money. A century later, John Locke and William\nPetty added two additional variables, the velocity and the\ntransactions level, to the core relation in the quantity theory of\nmoney. The velocity of money is something of a misnomer. It is the\naverage rate at which a given unit of currency turns over in a given\nperiod of time. The transactions level is the rate at which payments\nare made, for example wages (daily or weekly) or rents (quarterly).\nFor the capital bill, Petty estimated that five per cent of its value\nwas manifest in liquid terms at any point of the year, a sum\nequivalent to the interest payment. As a remedy for the shortage of\nmoney, a problem that beset not only Petty\u2019s Ireland but\nvirtually every nation, the best policy was to shorten the temporal\ninterval for the transactions level and hence increase the velocity.\nThese four variables were cemented by Irving Fisher in 1911, with his\nequation that MV = PT (money supply (M) times the velocity of money\n(V) is equal to the price level (P) times the transactions level (T)).\nFisher was also the first to measure the velocity of money. The\naverage rate for the turnover of one dollar in New Haven was twenty\ntimes per annum.\n\nThe quantity theory of money also entails the neutrality of money.\nHume broached a series of thought experiments, whereby the quantity of\nmoney in a nation doubled or halved overnight, or was reduced by an\neven greater amount, four-fifths (\u201cOf Interest\u201d [1987:\n299]; \u201cOf the Balance of Trade\u201d [1987: 311]). He argued\nthat this would have no lasting effect. In the case of an increase,\nprices would rise commensurate to the increase in money as dictated by\nthe quantity theory. As a result, imports would surge because foreign\ngoods were favorably priced, and the specie would flow out almost\nimmediately and prices return to their original level, hence what came\nto be known as the specie-flow mechanism. Earlier contributors, such\nas Mun, had already argued that money would follow trade, and hence\nthat the quantity of specie in England would reflect the balance of\ntrade. If the balance was favorable, such that exports exceeded\nimports, the nation\u2019s coffers would be augmented. Hume\nextrapolated from Mun\u2019s one nation to the entire globe. Imposing\nthe metaphor of the world\u2019s oceans, Hume argued that it was no\nmore possible to stockpile specie in a nation than to dam the oceans\nand raise them above sea-level. Each nation would see its domestic\nprices rise or fall in accordance with the quantity of money, and\nhence the strong propensity for the global supply of money to\nequilibrate in each nation in line with the balance of trade. It\nrested on a clear understanding of the distinction between the nominal\nand the real.\n\nNotwithstanding his brilliant argument for the neutrality of money,\nHume recognized that the specie-flow mechanism was never fully\nachieved; trade barriers, transaction costs, and other interferences\nwith the money supply limited its full operation. As a result, Hume\nendorsed the non-neutrality of money as more veridical. He argued\nthat, from roughly 1500 to 1750, the money supply had increased by a\nfactor of eight but the price level had only increased by a factor of\nfour. The simple reason was significant economic growth, a doubling of\noutput that required the extant money to service the significant\nincrease in transactions. The growth was stimulated by many factors,\nthe gains from trade, the division of labor, and the accumulation of\ncapital. Hume also acknowledged the importance of new technologies and\ntheir rapid spread once in place. Above all, he discerned that money\ncould engender growth, even though this remained mysterious and was\nnot \u201ceasily accounted for\u201d (Hume \u201cOf Money\u201d\n[1987: 288).\n\nHume articulated the various steps by which an influx of good Spanish\ncoins might magically stimulate economic growth. The circulation of\nthe additional coins could induce a multiplier effect that essentially\nincentivized weavers and farmers to work more intensively. They did\nthis for an interval of time, until prices and wages caught up to the\nadditional money stock and reached a level once more. In short, the\nspecie-flow mechanism was couched as an ideal (friction-free) process,\nunderstood as a thought experiment, whereas the injection of new money\nand its circulation resulted in genuine economic growth. Milton\nFriedman received the Nobel Prize for making these arguments, but he\npaid specific homage to Hume for the central analysis (Schabas &\nWennerlind 2020: 208, 232). Friedman also credits Hume with asking\nwhat the optimal quantity of money for a given nation would be, but in\nfact several before Hume had grappled with this question, Petty and\nBerkeley most notably. Hume\u2019s work is best known but there were\ndozens at the time who articulated one or more of the three core\nprinciples of monetary theory, the quantity theory, the specie-flow\nmechanism, and the multiplier.\n\nOnly the first of these three could be easily verified by empirical\nfindings. Because legal tender was issued by the royal mint, it was\npossible to estimate the money supply. Hume, for example, claimed that\nabout 90 million pounds circulated in Britain circa 1750. It was much\nmore difficult to measure changes to the price level. Consumer price\nindexing, a systematic method for measuring inflation that would serve\nto confirm the quantity theory of money, was first devised in the late\nnineteenth century and only undertaken by state agencies in the\ndecades after World War One. Nevertheless, early modern economists\ndevised clever means to measure the purchasing power of the currency,\nwhether by examining the price of corn (grains) or looking to other\nbenchmarks. William Fleetwood\u2019s Chronicon Preciosum; or an\nAccount of English Money, the Price of Corn and other Commodities for\nthe last 600 years (1707), proved an invaluable resource. He also\nmade estimates of purchasing power, noting that his stipend as a\nFellow of King\u2019s College Cambridge, which had been fixed at five\npounds in 1450 ought to be increased to thirty pounds to command the\nsame value. Adam Smith proposed the longterm silver price of corn as\nthe best metric for estimating inflation. His belief was that one must\ntake a weighted average over a longer period of time, 50 to 100 years\nin order to eliminate the seasonal variations in harvests or isolated\ndiscoveries of silver reserves.\n\nThe focus on corn prices also unleashed another central principle of\neconomics, the law of demand (quantity demanded is an inverse function\nof price). The so-called King-Davenant law, attributed to Gregory King\n(see Evans 1967) and Charles Davenant (1698) of the late seventeenth\ncentury, provided a time series analysis of corn prices (see Hutchison\n1988: 46\u201353). They argued that in the case of a severe shortage\nof corn, a fall by fifty per cent of the normal supply, the price\ncould increase by forty-five per cent. They also provided data in the\ncase of a bountiful harvest. Their chart established that the function\nwas an inverse one and, significantly, nonlinear.\n\nThe early modern period was plagued by a shortage of coins, and of\nthose in circulation, most were clipped or hammered. Gresham\u2019s\nlaw, that bad coins drive out the good ones, explained this phenomenon\nvery well. It was estimated that the average coin had only half of the\nmetallic content that had been stipulated by the mint. This meant that\ncountless people were filing the coins and melting the shavings into\nbullion for additional remuneration from the mint. It was illegal to\ntamper with coins, and for most countries of Western Europe, the death\npenalty applied, even if one was caught simply with the tools of the\ntrade. Other commonplace illegal activities were counterfeiting paper\nbanknotes, bribery, smuggling, and adulterating products for sale. It\nwould be difficult to estimate the overall level of such activities,\nbut a background assumption in the writings of most early modern\neconomists was the understanding that criminal methods were widespread\n(see Wennerlind 2011). The demise of Spain had become a trope, insofar\nas it had been illegally drained of its American silver. As Hume\nnoted, smugglers in the previous two centuries had taken the Spanish\nsilver over the Pyrenees where French prices were one-tenth those in\nSpain (\u201cOf the Balance of Trade\u201d [1987: 312]). The money\nhad saturated most where there was international trade. By the early\nseventeenth century, it was the Dutch East India Company that\ncommanded the envy of European traders, and its legacy was such that\nMexican silver coins continued to dominate Asian trade until the\nnineteenth century.\n\nEarly modern philosophers weighed in on legal monetary interventions,\nnotably debasement, devaluation, or recoinage. For most, the preferred\npolicy was to leave the money stock untouched, or restore its nominal\nmetallic value given the widespread hammering and clipping of coins.\nIn the fourteenth century, the French crown had altered the currency,\nmostly with debasements, more than eighty times. As Bodin recognized,\nthis increased the money supply and hence raised prices, but it also\nundermined confidence in the stability of the currency. There is no\ngreater incident of leading philosophers tampering with the money\nsupply than when Locke and Newton famously oversaw the Great Recoinage\nof 1696. Locke persuaded Newton to do the opposite of a debasement,\nnamely to restore the silver content of the shilling to the amount\nstipulated by Elizabeth I circa 1600 (see Appleby 1978; Vaughn 1980).\nNewton thus affirmed Locke\u2019s belief in essentialism (see\nCaffentzis 1989). This meant that those willing to break the law\nbenefitted from a de facto money pump, and the crown lost\nsome two million pounds (roughly thirty million pounds in total was in\ncirculation). This contraction of the money supply engendered an\neconomic downturn, but for other reasons the English economy began to\nexpand and flourish under the reign of Queen Anne.\n\nIn their analysis of the essential properties of money, a number of\nearly modern philosophers climbed several rungs of the ladder of\nmonetary abstraction. George Berkeley, in his short tract The\nQuerist (1725), recognized that the substance used for money was\nirrelevant, and thus promoted the concept of fiat money, a counter or\ntoken that was recognized as legal tender but not redeemable for a\nprecious metal. (Caffentzis 2000). Benjamin Franklin (1729) proposed a\nnovel schema whereby notes were issued with the land as the underlying\nasset, but the practice was short-lived in colonial Pennsylvania.\nHume, while secretary to the British ambassador in France in 1765,\noversaw the dismantling of a fiat-currency in Qu\u00e9bec that had\ncommenced in 1685 and the reinstatement of British Sterling in lower\nCanada.\n\nIn his Treatise, Hume broached the idea that money is\nanalogous to language, both in its commencement in a prehistoric age,\nand in the sense that its primary role is to represent value, much as\nwords represent objects (see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020:\n99\u2013101). Neither money nor language adequately refer to objects\nin this sense, but we tend to be duped into thinking that they do.\nBecause of this imperfect mapping, and the fact that money embodies a\npledge, a type of speech act, Hume was also inclined to appreciate\npaper banknotes, whether from private banks or the Exchequer. He did\nnot share Locke\u2019s view that nature had stamped an indelible\nvalue on gold and silver. Hume grasped that credit forms a continuum\nwith money, and noted that there was a range of degrees of liquidity:\nmortgages, bonds, equities, promissory notes, bills of exchange, and\nso forth. Hume praised the recent innovations of Scottish bankers, to\ndevise daily lines of credit so that merchants might monetize idle\ncapital, and to issue ten-shilling notes denominated such that\nordinary tradesmen might use them. He estimated that in 1750, over\nhalf the transactions in Britain were conducted with paper-notes, thus\nlubricating the wheels of trade that much the better.\n\nSmith was more inclined to see banking and credit as precarious, and\ncaptured this sentiment with his metaphor of paper money as a\n\u201csort of wagon-way through the air\u201d, bolstered by its\n\u201cDaedalian wings\u201d (Smith 1776 [1976: 321]). If banks were\nreckless with their issuance, their bills would soar in value and\nbecome over-heated, as witnessed in the serious bank failures of 1772.\nSmith in general was more circumspect about the benefits of merchants\nand overseas trade, and he argued for firm regulations to be imposed\non banks and credit markets.\n\nIn the early 1670s, Shaftesbury, who had become chancellor of the\nExchequer, encouraged Locke to oppose a measure that would set a legal\nceiling of four percent on the interest rate. Locke revisited the\ndebate in 1692, and in both cases, persuaded the government to keep a\nhigher ceiling. Locke argued that in a world of perfectly competitive\nbanking a \u201cnatural\u201d rate of interest would override the\nlegal one (see Vaughn 1980). Ironically, he made his arguments before\nthe monopolistic Bank of England was formed in 1694. Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s Defence of Usury (1787), in opposition to\nSmith, restored Locke\u2019s position that the interest rate ought to\nbe unregulated and hence subject solely to market forces (see Sigot\n2001). Smith\u2019s position has remained a puzzle, since for the\nmost part, interest rates were low and hence non-usurious, and because\nSmith in general embraced laissez-faire thinking (see\nHollander 1999). Both Hume and Smith recognized the longterm tendency\nof the interest rate to fall, from ten percent under Elizabeth I to\nthree or four percent in their day, and they arrived at the more\nprofound understanding that this was due to capital accumulation and\nsophisticated commerce and trade. They did not articulate the\nprinciple of zero profits, but they understood that in a perfectly\ncompetitive world, the profit rate would equal the interest rate, the\ncost of borrowing capital.\n\nThe most central leitmotif of early modern economics was its\nappreciation for the transformative effects of money. Hobbes, drawing\non William Harvey, had depicted money as the blood that courses\nthrough the body politic (see Christensen 1989; Apeldoorn 2017). Money\nvitalized a region, and was most effective if it was in circulation\nand \u201cquickened\u201d, that is, increased its velocity. Quesnay\nunderscored the importance of the circulation of money, particularly\nbullion, and its multiplier effects, again drawing an analogy to\nHarvey\u2019s great discovery. The French had initially, under the\ninspiration of the Scottish \u00e9migr\u00e9 John Law (1705),\nembraced private banknotes and equity swaps. But after the collapse of\nthe Mississippi Company in 1720, for which Law was blamed, they chose\nto hoard silver as household plate, and banking did not recover until\nthe end of the century. The Dutch and the British, looking to France,\nimposed a tax on silverware and promoted the use of chinaware as\nmeasures to reduce hoarding.\n\nIn the second of his Two Treatise of Government (1689), Locke\nprovided an important fable as to how money came into being as a store\nof wealth given the existence of perishable goods. Hume, conversely,\nemphasized money as a medium of exchange, as the \u201coil\u201d\nwhich lubricated the \u201cwheels of trade\u201d (\u201cOf\nMoney\u201d [1987: 281]). Hume\u2019s story looked more to the\nallure of luxury goods and the rise of towns and cities as prompting\nthe thorough monetization of the countryside, such that \u201cno hand\nis entirely empty of it [money]\u201d (ibid. [1987: 294]). Once this\nwas achieved, however, money took on a power of its own, one that no\ngovernment could adequately control. As a general maxim, Hume declared\nthat\n\n\na government has great reason to preserve with care its people and its\nmanufactures. Its money, it may safely trust to the course of human\naffairs, without fear or jealousy. (\u201cOf the Balance of\nTrade\u201d [1987: 326])\n\n\nMoney may well be a human artifact, but as Hume and Smith, among\nothers, argued, it operated according to laws that transcended\nindividual human agency. \u201cMoney answers all things\u201d, to\nquote the title of Jacob Vanderlint\u2019s influential book of 1734.\nMoney had become so complex and so deeply entrenched in the social\nfabric of modern commercial society that measures to retain or channel\nit were believed to be futile.\n",
