    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Connectionism\n4.6 Connectionism\n\nConnectionist networks consisting of simple nodes and links are very\nuseful for understanding psychological processes that involve parallel\nconstraint satisfaction. Such processes include aspects of vision,\ndecision making, explanation selection, and meaning making in language\ncomprehension. Connectionist models can simulate learning by methods\nthat include Hebbian learning and backpropagation. The explanatory\nschema for the connectionist approach is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nWhy do people have a particular kind of intelligent behavior?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nPeople have representations that involve simple processing units\nlinked to each other by excitatory and inhibitory connections.\nPeople have processes that spread activation between the units via\ntheir connections, as well as processes for modifying the\nconnections.\nApplying spreading activation and learning to the units produces\nthe behavior.\n\n\n\nSimulations of various psychological experiments have shown the\npsychological relevance of the connectionist models, which are,\nhowever, only very rough approximations to actual neural networks.\n(For more information, see the entry on\n connectionism.)\n",
