    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || The Theological Objection\n2.1 The Theological Objection\n\nSubstance dualists believe that thinking is a function of a\nnon-material, separately existing, substance that somehow\n\u201ccombines\u201d with the body to make a person. So\u2014the\nargument might go\u2014making a body can never be sufficient to\nguarantee the presence of thought: in themselves, digital computers\nare no different from any other merely material bodies in being\nutterly unable to think. Moreover\u2014to introduce the\n\u201ctheological\u201d element\u2014it might be further added\nthat, where a \u201csoul\u201d is suitably combined with a body,\nthis is always the work of the divine creator of the universe: it is\nentirely up to God whether or not a particular kind of body is imbued\nwith a thinking soul. (There is well known scriptural support for the\nproposition that human beings are \u201cmade in God\u2019s\nimage\u201d. Perhaps there is also theological support for the claim\nthat only God can make things in God\u2019s image.)\n\nThere are several different kinds of remarks to make here. First,\nthere are many serious objections to substance dualism. Second, there\nare many serious objections to theism. Third, even if theism and\nsubstance dualism are both allowed to pass, it remains quite unclear\nwhy thinking machines are supposed to be ruled out by this combination\nof views. Given that God can unite souls with human bodies, it is hard\nto see what reason there is for thinking that God could not unite\nsouls with digital computers (or rocks, for that matter!). Perhaps, on\nthis combination of views, there is no especially good reason why,\namongst the things that we can make, certain kinds of digital\ncomputers turn out to be the only ones to which God gives\nsouls\u2014but it seems pretty clear that there is also no\nparticularly good reason for ruling out the possibility that God would\nchoose to give souls to certain kinds of digital computers. Evidence\nthat God is dead set against the idea of giving souls to certain kinds\nof digital computers is not particularly thick on the ground.\n",
