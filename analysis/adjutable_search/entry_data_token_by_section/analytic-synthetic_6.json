    "main_text": "Problems with the Distinction || The Paradox of Analysis\n3.1 The Paradox of Analysis\n\nOne problem with the entire program was raised by C.H. Langford (1942)\nand discussed by G.E. Moore (1942 [1968], pp. 665\u20136): why should\nanalyses be of any conceivable interest? After all, if an analysis\nconsists in providing the definition of an expression, then it should\nbe providing a synonym for it, and this, then, should be wholly\nuninformative: if brother is analyzed as the presumably\nsynonymous male sibling, then the claim Brothers are male\nsiblings should be synonymous with Brothers are\nbrothers, and thinking the one should be no different from\nthinking the other. But, aside from such simple cases as\nbrother and bachelor, proposed analyses, if\nsuccessful, often seemed quite non-obvious and philosophically\ninformative. The proposed reductions of, say, material object\nstatements to sensory ones (even where successful) were often fairly\ncomplex, had to be studied and learned, and so could hardly be\nuninformative. So how could they count as seriously\n analytic?[6]\n\nThis is \u201cthe paradox of analysis,\u201d which can be seen as\ndormant in Frege\u2019s own move from his (1884) focus on definitions\nto his more controversial (1892a) doctrine of \u201csense,\u201d\nwhere two senses are distinct if and only if someone can think a\nthought containing the one but not other, as in the case of the senses\nof \u201cthe morning star\u201d and \u201cthe evening star.\u201d\nIf analyses or definitions preserved sense, then, unlike the case of\n\u201cmorning star\u201d and \u201cevening star,\u201d whenever\none thought the definiendum, one should thereby be thinking the\ndefiniens. And perhaps one can\u2019t think Bill is Bob\u2019s\nbrother without thinking Bill is Bob\u2019s male sibling. But few of\nFrege\u2019s definitions of arithmetic concepts are nearly so simple\n(see Gottlob Frege, \u00a72.5). In their case, it seems\nperfectly possible to think the definiendum, say, number,\nwithout thinking the elaborate definiens Frege provided (cf. Bealer\n1982, Michael Dummett 1991, and John Horty 1993, 2007, for extensive\ndiscussions of this problem, as well as of further conditions, e.g.,\nfecundity, that Frege placed on serious definitions).\n\nThese problems, so far, can be regarded as relatively technical, for\nwhich further technical moves within the program might be made. For\nexample, one might make further distinctions within the theory of\nsense between an expression\u2019s \u201ccontent\u201d and the\nspecific \u201clinguistic vehicle\u201d used for its expression, as\nin Fodor (1990a) and Horty (1993, 2007); and perhaps distinguish\nbetween the truth-conditional \u201ccontent\u201d of an expression\nand its idiosyncratic role, or \u201ccharacter,\u201d in a language\nsystem, along the lines of the distinction David Kaplan (1989)\nintroduced to deal with indexical and demonstrative expressions (such\nas I, now, and that; see\nDemonstratives, and Narrow Mental Content, as well\nas Stephen White, 1982). Perhaps analyses could be regarded as\nproviding a particular \u201cvehicle,\u201d having a specific\n\u201ccharacter,\u201d that could account for why one could\nentertain a certain concept without entertaining its analysis (cf.\nGillian Russell 2008, and Paul Pietroski 2002, 2005 and 2018 for\nrelated suggestions).\n\nHowever, the problems with the program seemed to many philosophers to\nbe deeper than merely technical. By far, the most telling and\ninfluential of the criticisms both of the program, and then of\nanalyticity in general, were those of Quine, who began as a great\nchampion of the program (see esp. his 1934), and whose subsequent\nobjections therefore carry special weight. The reader is well-advised\nto consult particularly his (1956 [1976], hereafter \u201cCLT\u201d)\nfor as rich and deep a discussion of the issues up to that time as one\nmight find. The next two sections abbreviate some of that\ndiscussion.\n",
