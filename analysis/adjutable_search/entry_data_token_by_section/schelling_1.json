    "main_text": "Transcendental Philosophy and Naturphilosophie\n2. Transcendental Philosophy and Naturphilosophie\n\nThe significance of the work of the early Schelling (1795\u20131800)\nlies in its attempts to give a new account of nature which, while\ntaking account of the fact that Kant had irrevocably changed the\nstatus of nature in modern philosophy, avoids some of the consequences\nof Kant\u2019s theory that were seen as problematic by Kant\u2019s\ncontemporaries and successors. For the Kant of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1781, 1787) nature is largely seen in the\n\u2018formal\u2019 sense, as that which is subject to necessary\nlaws. These laws are accessible to us, Kant argues, because cognition\ndepends on the subject bringing forms of thought, the categories, to\nbear on what it perceives. The problem this leads to is how the\nsubject could fit into a nature conceived of in deterministic terms,\ngiven that the subject\u2019s ability to know is dependent upon its\n\u2018spontaneous\u2019 self-caused ability to judge in terms of the\ncategories. Kant\u2019s response to this dilemma is to split the\n\u2018sensuous\u2019 realm of nature as law-bound appearance from\nthe \u2018intelligible\u2019 realm of the subject\u2019s cognitive\nand ethical self-determination. However, if the subject is part of\nnature there would seem to be no way of explaining how a nature which\nwe can only know as deterministic can give rise to a subject\nwhich seems to transcend determinism in its knowing and in its\nself-determined actions. Kant himself sought to bridge the realms of\nnecessity and spontaneity in the Critique of Judgement\n(1790), by suggesting that nature itself could be seen in more than\nformal terms: it also produces self-determining organisms and gives\nrise to disinterested aesthetic pleasure in the subject that\ncontemplates its forms. The essential problems remained, however, that\n(1) Kant gave no account of the genesis of the subject that transcends\nits status as a piece of determined nature, and (2) such an account\nwould have to be able to bridge the divide between nature and\nfreedom.\n\nThe tensions in Schelling\u2019s philosophy of this period, which set\nthe agenda for most of his subsequent work, derive, then, from the\nneed to overcome the perceived lack in Kant\u2019s philosophy of a\nsubstantial account of how nature and freedom come to co-exist. Two\nways out of Kantian dualism immediately suggested themselves to\nthinkers in the 1780s and 90s. On the one hand, Kant\u2019s arguments\nabout the division between appearances and things in themselves, which\ngave rise to the problem of how something \u2018in itself\u2019\ncould give rise to appearances for the subject, might be overcome by\nrejecting the notion of the thing in itself altogether. If what we\nknow of the object is the product of the spontaneity of the I, an\nIdealist could argue that the whole of the world\u2019s\nintelligibility is therefore the result of the activity of the\nsubject, and that a new account of subjectivity is required which\nwould achieve what Kant had failed to achieve. On the other hand, the\nfact that nature gives rise to self-determining subjectivity would\nseem to suggest that a monist account of a nature which was more than\na concatenation of laws, and was in some sense inherently\n\u2018subjective\u2019, would offer a different way of accounting\nfor what Kant\u2019s conception did not provide. Schelling seeks\nanswers to the Kantian problems in terms that relate to both these\nconceptions. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the conceptions are\nin one sense potentially identical: if the essence of nature is that\nit produces the subjectivity which enables it to understand itself,\nnature itself could be construed as a kind of\n\u2018super-subject\u2019. The main thinkers whose work is regarded\nas exemplifying these alternatives are J.G. Fichte, and Spinoza.\n\nThe source of Schelling\u2019s concern with Spinoza is the\n\u2018Pantheism controversy\u2019, which brought Spinoza\u2019s\nmonism into the mainstream of German philosophy. In 1783 the writer\nand philosopher F.H. Jacobi became involved in an influential dispute\nwith the Berlin Enlightenment philosopher Moses Mendelssohn over the\nclaim that G.E. Lessing had admitted to being a Spinozist, an\nadmission which at that time was tantamount to the admission of\natheism, with all the dangerous political and other consequences that\nentailed. In his On the Doctrine of Spinoza in Letters to Herr\nMoses Mendelssohn, (1785, second edition 1789), which was\ninfluenced by his reading of Kant\u2019s first Critique,\nJacobi revealed a problem which would recur in differing ways\nthroughout Schelling\u2019s work. Jacobi\u2019s interpretation of\nSpinozism was concerned with the relationship between the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019 and the \u2018conditioned\u2019, between\nGod as the ground of which the laws of nature are the consequent, and\nthe linked chains of the deterministic laws of nature. Cognitive\nexplanation relies, as Kant claimed, upon finding a thing\u2019s\n\u2018condition\u2019. Jacobi\u2019s question is how finding a\nthing\u2019s condition can finally ground its explanation, given that\neach explanation leads to a regress in which each condition depends\nupon another condition ad infinitum. Any philosophical system\nthat would ground the explanation of a part of nature thus\n\u201cnecessarily ends by having to discover conditions of\nthe unconditioned\u201d (Scholz, ed., 1916, p. 51). For\nJacobi this led to the need for a theological leap of faith, as the\nworld\u2019s intelligibility otherwise threatened to become a mere\nillusion, in which nothing would be finally grounded at all. In the\n1787 Introduction to the first Critique Kant maintains this\nproblem of cognitive grounding can be overcome by acknowledging that,\nwhile reason must postulate the \u201cunconditioned (\u2026) in all\nthings in themselves for everything conditioned, so that the series of\nconditions should thus become complete\u201d (Kant, Critique of\nPure Reason B, p. XX), by restricting knowledge to appearances,\nrather than assuming it to be of \u201cthings in themselves\u201d,\nthe contradiction of seeking conditions of the unconditioned can be\navoided. As we have already seen, though, this gives rise precisely to\nthe problem of how a subject which is not conditioned like the nature\nit comes to know can emerge as the ground of knowledge from\ndeterministic nature.\n\nThe condition of the knowledge of appearances for Kant is the\n\u2018transcendental subject\u2019, but what sort of\n\u2018condition\u2019 is the transcendental subject? The perception\nthat Kant has no proper answer to this problem initially unites\nSchelling and Fichte. Fichte insists in the\nWissenschaftslehre (1794) that the unconditioned status of\nthe I has to be established if Kant\u2019s system is to legitimate\nitself. He asserts that \u201cIt is (\u2026) the ground of\nexplanation of all facts of empirical consciousness that before all\npositing in the I the I itself must previously be posited\u201d\n(Fichte 1971, p. 95), thereby giving the I the founding role which he\nthought Kant had failed adequately to explicate. Fichte does this by\nextending the consequences of Kant\u2019s claim that the cognitive\nactivity of the I, via which it can reflect upon itself,\ncannot be understood as part of the causal world of appearances, and\nmust therefore be part of the noumenal realm, the realm of the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. For Fichte the very existence of\nphilosophy depends upon the free act of the I which initiates the\nreflection on its own activity by the I.\n\nSchelling takes up the issues raised by Jacobi and Fichte in two texts\nof 1795: Of the I as Principle of Philosophy or on the\nUnconditional in Human Knowledge, and Philosophical Letters\non Dogmatism and Criticism. In a move which prefigures aspects of\nHeidegger\u2019s questioning of the notion of being, he reinterprets\nKant\u2019s question as to the condition of possibility of synthetic\njudgements a priori as a question about why there is a realm of\njudgements, a manifest world requiring syntheses by the subject for\nknowledge to be produced, at all. In Of the I, Schelling puts\nKant\u2019s question in Fichtean terms: \u201chow is it that the\nabsolute I goes out of itself and opposes a Not-I to itself?\u201d\n(S\u00e4mmtliche Werke [SW], I/1, p. 175).\nHe maintains that the condition of knowledge, the\n\u2018positing\u2019 by the I of that which is opposed to it, must\nhave a different status from the determined realm which it posits:\n\u201cnothing can be posited by itself as a thing, i.e. an\nabsolute/unconditioned thing (unbedingtes Ding) is a\ncontradiction\u201d (ibid., p. 116). However, his key worry\nabout Fichte\u2019s position already becomes apparent in the\nPhilosophical Letters, where he drops the Fichtean\nterminology: \u201cHow is it that I step at all out of the\nabsolute and move towards something opposed (auf ein\nEntgegengesetztes)?\u201d (ibid., p. 294). The problem\nSchelling confronts was identified by his friend H\u00f6lderlin, in\nthe light of Jacobi\u2019s formulation of the problem of the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. Fichte wished to understand the absolute\nas an I in order to avoid the problem of nature \u2018in\nitself\u2019 which creates Kantian dualism. For something to be an I,\nthough, it must be conscious of an other, and thus in a relationship\nto that other. The overall structure of the relationship could not,\ntherefore, be described from only one side of that relationship.\nH\u00f6lderlin argued that one has to understand the structure of the\nrelationship of subject to object in consciousness as grounded in\n\u2018a whole of which subject and object are the parts\u2019, which\nhe termed \u2018being\u2019. This idea will be vital to Schelling at\nvarious times in his philosophy.\n\nIn the 1790s, then, Schelling is seeking a way of coming to terms with\nthe ground of the subject\u2019s relationship to the object world.\nHis aim is to avoid the fatalist consequences of Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem by taking on key aspects of Kant\u2019s and Fichte\u2019s\ntranscendental philosophy, and yet not to fall into the trap\nH\u00f6lderlin identified in Fichte\u2019s conception of an absolute\nI. In his Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature), which\nemerges in 1797 and develops in the succeeding years, and in the\nSystem of Transcendental Idealism of 1800, Schelling wavers\nbetween a Spinozist and a Fichtean approach to the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019. In the Naturphilosophie the\nKantian division between nature as appearance and nature in itself is\nseen as resulting from the fact that the nature theorised in cognitive\njudgements is objectified in opposition to the knowing subject. This\nobjectification, the result of the natural sciences\u2019 search for\nfixed laws, fails to account for the living dynamic forces in nature,\nincluding those in our own organism, with which Kant himself became\nconcerned in the third Critique and other late work, and\nwhich had played a role in Leibniz\u2019s account of nature. Nature\nin itself is thought of by Schelling as a \u2018productivity\u2019:\n\u201cAs the object [qua \u2018conditioned\ncondition\u2019] is never absolute/unconditioned (unbedingt)\nthen something per se non-objective must be posited in nature; this\nabsolutely non-objective postulate is precisely the original\nproductivity of nature\u201d (SW I/3, p. 284). The Kantian dualism\nbetween things in themselves and appearances is a result of the fact\nthat the productivity can never appear as itself and can only appear\nin the form of \u2018products\u2019, which are the productivity\n\u2018inhibiting\u2019 itself. The products are never complete in\nthemselves: they are like the eddies in a stream, which temporarily\nkeep their shape via the resistance of the movement of the fluid to\nitself that creates them, despite the changing material flowing\nthrough them.\n\nSchelling next tries to use the insights of transcendental philosophy,\nwhile still avoiding Kant\u2019s dualism, to explain our knowledge of\nnature. The vital point is that things in themselves and\n\u2018representations\u2019 cannot be absolutely different because\nwe know a world which exists independently of our will, which can yet\nbe affected by our will:\n\none can push as many transitory materials as one wants, which become\nfiner and finer, between mind and matter, but sometime the point must\ncome where mind and matter are One, or where the great leap that we so\nlong wished to avoid becomes inevitable. (SW I/2, p. 53)\n\n\nThe Naturphilosophie includes ourselves within nature, as\npart of an interrelated whole, which is structured in an ascending\nseries of \u2018potentials\u2019 that contain a polar opposition\nwithin themselves. The model is a magnet, whose opposing poles are\ninseparable from each other, even though they are opposites. As\nproductivity nature cannot be conceived of as an object, since it is\nthe subject of all possible real \u2018predicates\u2019, of the\n\u2018eddies\u2019 of which transient, objective nature consists.\nHowever, nature\u2019s \u2018inhibiting\u2019 itself in order to\nbecome something determinate means that the \u2018principle of all\nexplanation of nature\u2019 is \u2018universal duality\u2019, an\ninherent difference of subject and object which prevents nature ever\nfinally reaching stasis (SW I/3, p. 277). At the same time this\ndifference of subject and object must be grounded in an identity which\nlinks them together, otherwise all the problems of dualism would just\nreappear. In a decisive move for German Idealism, Schelling parallels\nthe idea of nature as the producing subject with the spontaneity of\nthe thinking subject, which is the condition of the syntheses required\nfor the constitution of objectivity. The problem for Schelling lies in\nexplicating how these two \u2018subjects\u2019 relate to each\nother.\n\nIn the System of Transcendental Idealism Schelling goes back\nto Fichtean terminology, though he will soon abandon most of it. He\nendeavours to explain the emergence of the thinking subject from\nnature in terms of an \u2018absolute I\u2019 coming retrospectively\nto know itself in a \u2018history of self-consciousness\u2019 that\nforms the material of the system. The System recounts the\nhistory of which the transcendental subject is the result. A version\nof the model Schelling establishes will be adopted by Hegel in the\nPhenomenology of Mind. Schelling presents the process in\nterms of the initially undivided I splitting itself in order to\narticulate itself in the syntheses, the \u2018products\u2019, which\nconstitute the world of knowable nature. The founding stages of this\nprocess, which bring the world of material nature into being, are\n\u2018unconscious\u2019. These stages then lead to organic nature,\nand thence to consciousness and self-consciousness. Schelling claims,\nin the wake of Fichte, that the resistance of the noumenal realm to\ntheoretical knowledge results from the fact that \u201cthe\n[practical] act [of the absolute I] via which all limitation is\nposited, as condition of all consciousness, does not itself come to\nconsciousness\u201d (SW I/3, p. 409). He prophetically attempts to\narticulate a theory which comes to terms with the idea that thought is\ndriven by forces which are not finally transparent to it, of the kind\nlater to become familiar in psychoanalysis. How, though, does one gain\naccess by thought to what cannot be an object of consciousness? This\naccess is crucial to the whole project because without it there can be\nno understanding of why the move from determined nature to the freedom\nof self-determining thinking takes place at all.\n\nSchelling adopts the idea from the early Romantic thinkers Friedrich\nSchlegel and Novalis, whom he knew in Jena at this time, that art is\nthe route to an understanding of what cannot appear as an object of\nknowledge. Philosophy cannot represent nature in itself because access\nto the unconscious must be via what appears to consciousness in the\nrealm of theoretical knowledge. The work of art is evidently an\nempirical, appearing object like any other, but if it is not more than\nwhat it is qua determinable object it cannot be a work of\nart, because this requires both the free judgement of the subject and\nthe object\u2019s conveying of something beyond its objective nature.\nAlthough the System\u2019s own very existence depends upon\nthe transition from theoretical to practical philosophy, which\nrequires the breaking-off of Jacobi\u2019s chain of\n\u2018conditions\u2019 by something unconditioned, Schelling is\nconcerned to understand how the highest insight must be into reality\nas a product of the interrelation of both the \u2018conscious\u2019\nand the \u2018unconscious\u2019. Reality is not, therefore,\nessentially captured by a re-presentation of the objective by the\nsubjective. Whereas in the System nature begins unconsciously\nand ends in conscious philosophical and scientific knowledge, in the\nart work: \u201cthe I is conscious according to the production,\nunconscious with regard to the product\u201d (SW I/3, p. 613). The\nproduct cannot be understood via the intentions of its producer, as\nthis would mean that it became a \u2018conditioned\u2019 object,\nsomething produced in terms of a pre-existing rule, and would\ntherefore lack what makes mere craft into art. Art is, then,\n\u201cthe only true and eternal organ and document of philosophy,\nwhich always and continuously documents what philosophy cannot\nrepresent externally\u201d (ibid., p. 627). The particular\nsciences can only follow the chain of conditions, via the principle of\nsufficient reason, and must determine any object via its place in that\nchain, a process which has no necessary end. The art object, on the\nother hand, manifests what cannot be understood in terms of its\nknowable conditions, because an account of the materials of which it\nis made or of its status as object in the world does not constitute it\nas art. Art shows what cannot be said. Philosophy cannot positively\nrepresent the absolute because \u2018conscious\u2019 thinking\noperates from the position where the \u2018absolute identity\u2019\nof the subjective and the objective has always already been lost in\nthe emergence of consciousness.\n\nAlthough Schelling\u2019s early work did not fully satisfy either\nhimself, or anybody else, it manages to address, in a cogent and\nilluminating fashion, many topics which affect subsequent philosophy.\nThe model presented in the System impresses not least\nbecause, at the same time as establishing the notion of the history of\nself-consciousness that would be decisive for Hegel, it offers, in a\nmanner which goes beyond its sources in Fichte, a model of the\nrelationship between the subject and its conceptually inaccessible\nmotivating forces which would affect thinkers from Schopenhauer, to\nNietzsche, to Freud, and beyond.\n",
