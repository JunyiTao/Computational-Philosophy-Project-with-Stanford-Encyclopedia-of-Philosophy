    "main_text": "Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle || Strict Laws\n3.1 Strict Laws\n\nThe nature of the strict laws required by the cause-law principle is\nas follows. For any causal relationship between particular events\ne1 and e2, there must be a law\nof the form\n\u2018(C1\u00a0&\u00a0D1)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D2\u2019,\nwhere \u2018C1\u2019 states a set of standing\nconditions, and \u2018D1\u2019 is a description\nof e1 that is sufficient, given\nC1, for the occurrence of an event of the kind\n\u2018D2\u2019, which is a description of\ne2. Traditionally, a strict law has been thought\nof as one where the condition and event-types specified in the\nantecedent are such as to guarantee that the condition or\nevent-types specified in the consequent occur\u2014the latter\nmust occur if the former in fact obtain. But indeterministic\nor probabilistic versions of strict laws are possible as well\n(Davidson 1970, 219). The point that distinguishes strict laws is not\nso much the guaranteeing of the effect by satisfaction of the\nantecedent as the inclusion, in the antecedent, of all conditions and\nevents that can be stated that could possibly prevent the\noccurrence of the effect. A strict indeterministic law would\nbe one that specified everything required in order for some effect to\noccur. If the effect does not occur when those conditions obtain,\nthere is nothing else that could be cited in explanation of this\nfailure (other than the brute fact of an indeterministic universe).\nFor reasons of simplicity, we will assume determinism in this\ndiscussion, though what is said about strict laws could be carried\nover without remainder to strict indeterministic laws.\n\nThe cause-law principle is aimed, in the first instance, at laws of\nsuccession, which cover singular causal relationships between\nevents at distinct times. However, as will become clearer below,\nmental anomalism also takes in bridge laws that would\ncorrelate simultaneous instantiations of mental and physical\npredicates as well\u2014such as\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018M1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P1\u2019,\nor\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2194\u00a0M1\u2019.\nIndeed, mental anomalism rejects the possibility of any\nstrict law in which mental predicates figure (where those predicates\nfigure essentially, and are not redundant)\u2014including (as we have\nseen\n (2.3))\n laws formulated with purely mental predicates\n(\u2018(M1\u00a0&\u00a0M2)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M3\u2019),\nas well as laws with mental predicates in either the antecedent or\nconsequent, such as\n\u2018(M1\u00a0&\u00a0M2)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P1\u2019\nand\n\u2018(P1\u00a0&\u00a0P2)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019\nand mixed variants of these (see\n 4).\n\nThe denial of strict laws of these forms is consistent with allowing\nhedged versions of them which are qualified by a ceteris\nparibus clause. \u2018All things being equal\u2019 or\n\u2018under normal conditions\u2019, such psychological and\npsychophysical generalizations can, according to Davidson, be\njustifiably asserted (Davidson 1993, 9). As will be discussed below\n (4),\n denying the strict version of these generalizations amounts to\ndenying that the qualifying clause \u2018ceteris\nparibus\u2019 can be fully explicated. That is,\n\u2018ceteris paribus,\n((M1\u00a0&\u00a0\nM2)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P1)\u2019\ncannot be transformed into something like\n\u2018(P2\u00a0&\u00a0P3\u00a0&\u00a0\nM1\u00a0&\u00a0M2\u00a0&\u00a0M3)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\nP1\u2019 (for a related discussion of this\nparticular issue, see the debate between Schiffer 1991 and Fodor\n1991).\n\n(Davidson organizes his discussion of this transformation process, and\nAnomalous Monism more generally, around a distinction between\n\u2018homonomic\u2019 and \u2018heteronomic\u2019 generalizations\n(Davidson 1970, 219). That distinction is extremely problematic for\nthe purposes of establishing Anomalous Monism, and is set aside here\nin favor of the related (but by no means identical) distinction\nbetween strict and ceteris paribus generalizations. For\ndiscussion of the former distinction, see the supplement on\n Homonomic and Heteronomic Generalizations.)\n",
