    "main_text": "The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms || Arguments Against Descriptivism\n4.2 Arguments Against Descriptivism\n\nPutnam (1973, 1975a) and Kripke (1972) reject the descriptivist view\nof natural kind terms. Putnam\u2019s principal aim is to undermine\ninternalism about reference and extension (\u201cmeanings just\nain\u2019t in the head\u201d). Kripke\u2019s aim is first to\nrestate a Millian view of proper names (they denote without connoting)\nand then to extend that view to natural kind terms.\n(\u2018Millian\u2019 will be used to characterize any account of the\nsemantics of a term that claims that it denotes without connoting,\neven when applied, pace Mill, to kind terms.) According to\nKripke, Mill was right about proper names but wrong about kinds;\nMillianism\u2014Mill\u2019s denotation-without-connotation\nview\u2014is right for both sorts of term. Salmon (1982) categorizes\nKripke\u2019s arguments against descriptivism for singular terms\nunder the headings \u2018the modal arguments\u2019, \u2018the\nepistemological arguments\u2019, and \u2018the semantic\narguments\u2019\u2014this categorization is useful also for the\ncorresponding arguments against descriptivism for general terms.\n4.2.1 The Modal Arguments Against Descriptivism\n\nThe modal arguments against descriptivism take the following form. Let\nC be some natural kind and D be some complex set of\nreadily observable properties that would, on a descriptivist view, be\nmost naturally regarded as providing the content of the description\nthat constitutes the meaning of \u2018C\u2019. Now\nconsider:\n\n(K) \u2200x(x is an instance of the kind\nC \u2194 Dx).\n\n\nSince D is constitutive of the meaning of\n\u2018C\u2019, (K) should be analytic and so necessary. The\ndescriptive view would thus be refuted either by (i) metaphysically\npossible instances of the kind C that do not possess the\nproperty complex D or by (ii) metaphysically possible items\nthat do possess the property complex D without being\ninstances of C.\n\nSome proposed cases of (i) require the laws of nature to be\ncontingent. Although the laws of nature are widely held to be\ncontingent, some philosophers hold that the laws are necessary, on the\nbasis of essentialist arguments that are much of a piece with\nKripke\u2019s essentialist arguments, even if strictly independent of\nthem. The anti-descriptivist arguments regard the observable\nproperties of instances of a kind C as nomic consequences of\nthe essence of C. If the laws of nature are metaphysically\nnecessary then D will be a necessary property of instances\nof C also. Thus, instances of (i) will not be available. If\nthe laws are necessary, then the melting point of gold will be\nnecessary just as the atomic number of gold is. However, not all\nobservable properties are consequences of the laws alone. Some are\nconsequences of the laws plus contingent environmental factors. Thus\nthe perceived colour of an object may change with environmental\ndifferences. Thus if looking yellow is a component of\nD, then a possible world in which gold does not look yellow\n(because of unusual atmospheric effects)\u2014surely a genuine\npossibility\u2014would be a counterinstance of type (i). On the other\nhand, it might be argued, that the proper component of D\nwould be being yellow, in which case we will have the makings\nof an epistemological argument against descriptivism (see below).\n\nOther cases of (i) might be thought to be generated, irrespective of\nthe necessity of the laws, by noting that a kind might be manifested\nin two or more superficially distinct species. Thus allotropes are\ndistinct types of a single chemical kind that may differ considerably\nin superficial properties (for example, graphite and diamond, both\ntypes of the element carbon). Similarly, a caterpillar and a butterfly\ncan be members of the same species. For known cases, D would\nhave to be disjunctive. While that may not itself be problematic, it\nraises the epistemic possibility that the same phenomenon may be\n(nomically and metaphysically) possible for many kinds that we think\nexist in only one form.\n\nCases of (ii) may be more readily available, since the necessity of\nlaws may rule out a particular kind having different possible sets of\nmanifest properties, but does not rule out two distinct possible kinds\nhaving the same manifest properties. Indeed, the case of jadeite and\nnephrite is often referred to as an example of the latter. Along the\nsame lines, we may imagine that something like fool\u2019s gold, iron\npyrites, is just like gold in observable properties, differing only in\nchemical constitution. We may imagine that there were creatures to all\nappearances like cats, but which are internally robots; or just like\ntigers but had reptilian innards. These are all metaphysically\npossible, so the arguments go; hence, possession of the relevant\nproperties cannot suffice for membership of the corresponding\nkind.\n\nThe modal argument does not refute descriptivism applied to every\ndescription\u2014after all, Kripke and Putnam do both think that the\ndescription \u201cis constituted by H2O\u201d holds\nnecessarily of anything that is water. Rather, the modal argument is\nintended to exclude as possible descriptions those that could be\nconstitutive of a sense or connotation that is grasped by any\ncompetent user of the term. Such a sense, if it exists, would employ\ndescriptions that refer to the observable features of the members of a\nkind, not those features uncovered by science.\n4.2.2 The Epistemological Arguments\n\nThe epistemological arguments against descriptivism have a similar\nstructure to the modal arguments. Consider again the proposition (K).\nSomeone who uses the term \u2018C\u2019 competently should be\nthereby able to come to know that (K) is true, in virtue of grasping\nthe meaning of \u2018C\u2019. Thus (K) should be a priori.\nSo counterexamples to descriptivism would be cases (i) where although\none knows that some thing is of the kind C one cannot thereby\ncome to know that it possesses the property complex D, or\n(ii) where although one knows that some thing possesses the property\ncomplex D, one cannot thereby come to know that it is of the\nkind C.\n\nTo generate epistemological type (i) cases, Kripke asks us to imagine\nthat gold might be blue but only appears yellow thanks to an optical\nillusion, or that tigers do not normally have four legs, but only\nappear that way, again thanks to an illusion. However, if the\ndescriptions associated with \u2018gold\u2019 were to include\n\u2018is yellow\u2019 and the descriptions associated with\n\u2018tiger\u2019 include \u2018is four-legged\u2019 then we would\nknow a priori that these possibilities do not obtain. But\nthat seems to be a mistake. Although we may reasonably be confident\nthat gold really is yellow and not blue, and not just appearing that\nway, this confidence is not a priori but is instead a\nconsequence of a posteriori experience of the conditions\nunder which we have observed samples of gold. It is a matter of\ndiscovery whether we are subject to this kind of illusion, or whether\nsomething that is in fact white or grey could be gold; for example it\nis only a posteriori that we know that gold does not have\nwhite and grey allotropes, as tin does. (What is called \u2018white\ngold\u2019 is in fact an alloy of gold; but given a description of\nits appearance, it is not a priori that it is not gold. This\nis a contrapositive version of an epistemological type (i) case.)\nLikewise, turning to epistemological type (ii) cases, if descriptivism\nwere correct, we could rule out a priori the possibility that\nsomething has all the superficial properties of gold, but is not gold.\nBut again we do not have such a priori knowledge (again we\nnote that jadeite is superficially similar to nephrite but not the\nsame kind).\n\nPutnam\u2019s Division of Linguistic Labor may be thought of as\nfurnishing an epistemological argument. Putnam\u2019s idea is that\nthe referent of a term used by some individual may be fixed not by\ntheir own knowledge or beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain\nexperts to whom that individual defers. Since aluminium and molybdenum\nare different kinds, then according to descriptivism there should be\nsome a priori knowable features that will distinguish between\nthem for anyone who is capable of using \u2018aluminium\u2019 to\nrefer to the one kind and \u2018molybdenum\u2019 to the other kind.\nLikewise there should be some mental difference between a speaker in\nthe actual world who uses \u2018aluminium\u2019 to refer to\naluminium and a speaker in another world, where the instances of\naluminium and molybdenum are swapped (pans and cans are made of\nmolybdenum there), who uses \u2018aluminium\u2019 to refer to\nmolybdenum. But, says, Putnam, no such difference need exist: ordinary\nspeakers have these differentiated referring capacities without any\ndifference in knowledge of the referents. That is because those\nreferential capacities are parasitic on those of the experts who do\nhave the required discriminating knowledge (Putnam, 1975b, 228). Their\nknowledge fixes the referents of their use of \u2018aluminium\u2019\nand \u2018molybdenum\u2019. Our deference to them as those people\nwho could tell us which things are aluminium and which are molybdenum,\nmeans that our referents of \u2018aluminium\u2019 and\n\u2018molybdenum\u2019 are the same as theirs.\n4.2.3 The Semantic Arguments\n\nThe modal and epistemological arguments concern the modal and\nepistemic properties of propositions of the form of (K). If\ndescriptivism were correct then there should be for each kind,\nC, a proposition of that form employing a manifest property\ncomplex D, such that the proposition is analytic and hence\nboth necessary and a priori. The modal and epistemological\narguments deny this.\n\nNote that the modal and epistemological arguments are most naturally\npresented in the material mode, concerning the objects themselves and\ntheir relations. (K) is in the material mode and we ask about its\nmodal status, by talking about certain stuff and asking whether it is\nor would be gold if it had such-and-such properties, and so forth.\nLikewise, mutatis mutandis, for the epistemological\narguments. The semantic arguments differ in that they are presented in\nthe formal mode, concerning the linguistic expressions in question.\nThis is because we are asking what a term\u2019s reference or\nextension would be in certain counterfactual circumstances. To use an\nexample concerning a proper (singular) name, we start by imagining\nthat it turns out that Johannes Kepler had not been the first to\npostulate the laws of planetary motion, whereas it was an unknown\nstudent of Kepler\u2019s who did this first. Many people have no\nbeliefs about Kepler other that that he was the first person to\npostulate those laws. If our story were true, would the name\n\u2018Kepler\u2019, as used by such people, refer to the student or\nto the teacher? Our intuition, so anti-descriptivists maintain, is\nthat the name would still refer to the teacher, the man we (falsely)\nbelieved to be responsible for the discovery of the laws of planetary\nmotion. Yet, if the descriptivist account were correct for proper\nnames, then with respect to the people under consideration, their use\nof \u2018Kepler\u2019 would either refer to the student, or would\nfail to refer at all.\n\nBoth Putnam and Kripke take arguments of this sort to generalize to\nnatural kind terms. The best known of the semantic arguments as\napplied to natural kind terms is Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought\nexperiment (see Section 1.3.1). Putnam asks us to imagine that\nelsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in\nvirtually all respects, which we may call \u2018Twin Earth\u2019.\nHowever, where on Earth we find H2O, on Twin Earth we find\nXYZ, a substance with a fundamentally different chemical\nstructure from H2O, but which shares all its manifest\nproperties (boiling and freezing points, taste, odour, ability to\nsupport life, being the predominant constituent of precipitation,\nseas, lakes etc.) with H2O. Every inhabitant of Earth has a\ntwin equivalent on Twin Earth. Twin Earthlings (at least those in the\nparts bearing a geographical similarity to Earth\u2019s United\nStates, Australia, Jamaica, Pitcairn etc.) speak a language rather\nlike English and use the term \u2018water\u2019 in circumstances\nprecisely analogous to our uses of \u2018water\u2019 on Earth, e.g.,\nthey say that their lakes and reservoirs are full of\n\u2018water\u2019.\n\nThe semantic Twin Earth argument now proceeds by asking what the\nextension of \u2018water\u2019 is, as used by some Earthling, and\nlikewise what the extension of \u2018water\u2019 is, as used by some\nTwin Earthling. Putnam\u2019s appeal to our linguistic intuitions is\nsupposed to yield the verdict that the extension of the\nEarthling\u2019s use of \u2018water\u2019 includes all and only\nH2O whereas the Twin Earthling\u2019s use of\n\u2018water\u2019 includes all and only XYZ. In support of this we\nmay consider that this is the judgment we must come to if we\nEarthlings are not to deny what Earth chemists tell us, viz. that\nwater is H2O, nor, symmetrically, deny the Twin Earth\nchemists\u2019 assertion, \u2018water is XYZ\u2019. Nor will it do\nto gainsay our chemists\u2019 judgment that water is H2O,\ngiven the assumption of the existence of XYZ. For that is tantamount\nto the suggestion that (actual) Berzelius (the discoverer of the\ncorrect chemical formula for water) was not entitled to assert that\nwater is H2O until he had ruled out the possibility of some\nsubstance other than H2O sharing water\u2019s manifest\nqualities.\n\nThe thought experiment is now almost in a position to claim the\nforegoing as a counterexample to descriptivism, for XYZ will satisfy\nany set of manifest properties that could be constitutive of the\nmeaning of \u2018water\u2019 as used on Earth. Yet the extension of\nthat term excludes XYZ. However, the reference to chemists\u2019\nknowledge made above reminds us that there is a difference between not\nonly the physical constitution of Earth and Twin Earth, but also a\ndifference between the psychological states of their inhabitants. For\n(some of) those on Earth believe \u2018water is H2O\u2019\nwhereas their Twin Earth counterparts believe \u2018water is\nXYZ\u2019. Perhaps, at least for those speakers, those beliefs are\nalso constitutive of the meanings of the two terms \u2018water\u2019\n(Earth) and \u2018water\u2019 (Twin Earth). In order to exclude this\nresponse, Putnam asks us to consider the same comparison made in 1750,\nbefore any beliefs of this form were held. We now assume that there\nhas been no major change in the (cross-temporal) extension of\n\u2018water\u2019 (Earth) since 1750. (That is to say, when David\nHume asked for a glass of what he called \u2018water\u2019, he was\nrequesting the same stuff as we are when we make a request using the\nsame term.) Since, as argued above, the extensions of\n\u2018water\u2019 (Earth) and \u2018water\u2019 (Twin Earth)\ndiffer today, their extensions differed in 1750. But in 1750 the\ndescriptions associated with the word \u2018water\u2019 cannot\ndiffer between Earth and Twin Earth. This is because the molecular\nstructure of water was unknown in 1750, prior to the chemical\nrevolution (when phlogiston theory was replaced by Lavoisier\u2019s\nnew oxygen theory). Given that the molecular structure was unknown\neven to the experts, the descriptive resources available to Earthians\nand their Twin Earthian counterparts were identical. Nonetheless,\ntheir references using \u2018water\u2019 differed. Hence,\ndescriptions do not suffice to fix reference.\n",
