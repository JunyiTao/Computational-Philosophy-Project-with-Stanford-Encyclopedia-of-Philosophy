The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics\n\nDespite the fact that decoherence interactions extend the measurement\nproblem to the wider problem of the classical regime, decoherence\nis relevant to the solution of both problems because at the\nlevel of components of the wave function the quantum description\nof decoherence phenomena (tantalisingly!) includes both measurement\nresults and other quantum phenomena (such as quantum jumps) as well as\nclassical behaviour. This suggests that to a large extent decoherence\nprovides an interpretation-neutral strategy for tackling the\nmeasurement problem and the problem of the classical regime (a thesis\ndeveloped in greater detail by Rosaler 2016), and that the solution to\nthese problems lies in combining decoherence with the main\nfoundational approaches to quantum mechanics. \n\nThere are a wide range of approaches to the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, however (see also the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n In some cases, one just needs to point out how an approach fits into\nthe overall picture suggested by decoherence, other approaches are in\nfact less able to exploit the results of decoherence. (The term\n\u2018approach\u2019 here is more appropriate than the term\n\u2018interpretation\u2019, because several of these are in fact\nmodifications of or additions to the theory.) We\nshall thus discuss in turn a number of approaches and how they relate\nto decoherence. These will be: the three most widespread approaches in\nthe philosophy of physics (Everett, Bohm and GRW), followed by the\nmore \u2018orthodox\u2019 approaches of von Neumann, Heisenberg and\nBohr, and a few others.\n\nWe shall start with the Everett theory (or many-worlds interpretation)\nin some of its main variants. This is in fact most closely related to\ndecoherence, since the latter can be used to naturally identify stable\n(if branching) structures within the universal wave function that can\ninstantiate the multiplicity of worlds or measurement records or\nconscious experiences characteristic of Everettian views. Another\napproach that arguably makes crucial use of decoherence is pilot-wave\ntheory (or de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, or Bohmian mechanics), where\nparticle positions (or other suitable \u2018beables\u2019) are\nguided in their temporal evolution by the universal wave function. The\nbranching structure of the latter will clearly have an effect on the\ncharacter of the evolution of the variables it guides. Instead,\nspontaneous collapse theories intuitively have less to do with\ndecoherence because they seek to suppress unwanted superpositions.\nStill, they are also arguably able to make use of decoherence,\nperhaps with some qualifications.\n\nMore traditional approaches to quantum mechanics that somehow\nprivilege the notion of measurement or observation also may have\nless-than-obvious connections with decoherence and in fact fit less\nwell with it, but we shall look at von Neumann\u2019s,\nHeisenberg\u2019s and Bohr\u2019s views. Finally, we shall briefly\nmention other approaches and remark on their various relations to\ndecoherence. These will be Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics, modal\ninterpretations, and QBism. \n",
