    "main_text": "Aumann\u2019s Five Arguments and One More\n6. Aumann\u2019s Five Arguments and One More\n\nAumann advanced five arguments for bounded rationality, which we\nparaphrase here (1997).\n\n\n\nEven in very simple decision problems, most economic agents are not\n(deliberate) maximizers. People do not scan the choice set and\nconsciously pick a maximal element from it.\n\n\nEven if economic agents aspired to pick a maximal element from a\nchoice set, performing such maximizations are typically difficult and\nmost people are unable to do so in practice.\n\n\nExperiments indicate that people fail to satisfy the basic assumptions\nof rational decision theory.\n\n\nExperiments indicate that the conclusions of rational analysis\n(broadly construed to include rational decision theory) do not match\nobserved behavior.\n\n\nSome conclusions of rational analysis appear normatively\nunreasonable.\n\n\nIn the previous sections we covered the origins of each of\nAumann\u2019s arguments. Here we briefly review each, highlighting\nmaterial in other sections under this context.\n\nThe first argument, that people are not deliberate maximizers, was a\nworking hypothesis of Simon\u2019s, who maintained that people tend\nto satisfice rather than maximize\n (section 2.2).\n Kahneman and Tversky gathered evidence for the reflection effect in\nestimating the value of options, which is the reason for reference\npoints in prospect theory\n (section 2.4)\n and analogous properties within rank-dependent utility theory more\ngenerally (sections\n 1.2\n and\n 2.4).\n Gigerenzer\u2019s and Hertwig\u2019s groups at the Max Planck\nInstitute for Human Development both study the algorithmic structure\nof simple heuristics and the adaptive psychological mechanisms which\nexplain their adoption and effectiveness; both of their research\nprograms start from the assumption that expected utility theory is not\nthe right basis for a descriptive theory of judgment and\ndecision-making (sections\n 3,\n 5.3, and\n 7.2).\n\nThe second argument, that people are often unable to maximize even if\nthey aspire to, was made by Simon and Good, among others, and later by\nKahneman and Tversky. Simon\u2019s remarks about the complexity of\n\\(\\Gamma\\)-maxmin reasoning in working out the end-game moves in chess\n (section 2.2)\n is one of many examples he used over the span of his career, starting\nbefore his seminal papers on bounded rationality in the 1950s. The\nbiases and heuristics program spurred by Tversky and\nKahneman\u2019s work in the late 1960s and 1970s\n (section 7.1)\n launched the systematic study of when and why people\u2019s\njudgments deviate from the normative standards of expected utility\ntheory and logical consistency.\n\nThe third argument, that experiments indicate that people fail to\nsatisfy the basic assumptions of expected utility theory, was known\nfrom early on and emphasized by the very authors who formulated and\nrefined the homo economicus hypothesis\n (section 1)\n and whose names are associated with the mathematical foundations. We\nhighlighted an extended quote from Savage in\n section 1.3,\n but could mention as well a discussion of the theory\u2019s\nlimitations by de Finetti and Savage (1962), and even a closer reading\nof the canonical monographs of each, namely Savage 1954 and de Finetti\n1970. A further consideration, which we discussed in\n section 1.3\n is the demand of logical omniscience in expected utility\ntheory and nearly all axiomatic variants.\n\nThe fourth argument, regarding the differences between the predictions\nof rational analysis and observed behavior, we addressed in\ndiscussions of Brunswik\u2019s notion of ecological validity\n (section 3.2)\n and the traditional responses to these observations by rational\nanalysis\n (section 3.3).\n The fifth argument, that some of the conclusions of rational analysis\ndo not agree with a reasonable normative standard, was touched on in\nsections\n 1.2,\n 1.3, and the subject of\n section 5.\n\nImplicit in Aumann\u2019s first four arguments is the notion that\nglobal rationality\n (section 2)\n is a reasonable normative standard but problematic for descriptive\ntheories of human judgment and decision-making\n (section 8).\n Even the literature standing behind Aumann\u2019s fifth argument,\nnamely that there are problems with expected utility theory as a\nnormative standard, nevertheless typically address those shortcomings\nthrough modifications to, or extensions of, the underlying\nmathematical theory\n (section 1.2).\n This broad commitment to optimization methods, dominance reasoning,\nand logical consistency as bedrock normative principles is behind\napproaches that view bounded rationality as optimization under\nconstraints:\n\n\nBoundedly rational procedures are in fact fully optimal procedures\nwhen one takes account of the cost of computation in addition to the\nbenefits and costs inherent in the problem as originally posed (Arrow\n2004).\n\n\nFor a majority of researchers across disciplines, bounded rationality\nis identified with some form of optimization problem under\nconstraints.\n\nGerd Gigerenzer is among the most prominent and vocal critics of the\nrole that optimization methods and logical consistency plays in\ncommonplace normative standards for human rationality (Gigerenzer\n& Brighton 2009), especially the role those standards play in\nKahneman and Tversky\u2019s biases and heuristics program (Kahneman\n& Tversky 1996; Gigerenzer 1996). We turn to this debate next, in\n section 7.\n",
