    "main_text": "Idealist Politics || Progressive Liberalism\n4.2 Progressive Liberalism\n\nLike Mill, Green is committed to liberal essentials\u2014a largely\nsecular state, democratic political institutions in which the\nfranchise is widespread, private property rights, market economies,\nequal opportunity, and a variety of personal and civic liberties. Also\nlike Mill, Green is a perfectionist liberal, who thinks that the\njustification of liberal essentials is grounded in a conception of the\ncommon good that understands the good of each in terms of\nself-realization.\n\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist liberalism was influential in the\nformation of a New Liberalism in late 19th century Britain\n(e.g., Richter 1964; Nicholson 1990; Brink 2003: \u00a7XXIV). The Old\nLiberalism was concerned with negative liberty and sought to undo\nstate restrictions on liberties and opportunities and was expressed in\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution, and\nseveral electoral reforms that extended the scope of the franchise to\ninclude the rural and urban poor. By contrast, the New Liberalism\nthought that the defense of liberty and opportunity had to be\nsupplemented by social and economic reforms in labor, health, and\neducation to address the effects of social and economic inequality\n(e.g., Freeden 1978; Nicholson 1990: ch. 5; Simhony and Weinstein\n2001). Green was viewed by many as an important intellectual source\nfor the New Liberals. He supported\n\nregulation of labor contracts to limit workplace hours and factory\nconditions (Works II 515; III 365\u201369, 373),\nmeasures to provide greater opportunities for agricultural workers\nto own land (Works II 515, 532\u201334; III\n377\u201382),\npublic health and safety regulations (Works II 515; III\n373\u201374),\neducation reforms, improving access to elementary, secondary, and\nhigher education, regardless of socioeconomic status (Works\nII 515; III 369, 387\u2013476; V 285\u201386, 326\u201328),\nand\nthe improvement of educational and economic opportunities for\nwomen (PE \u00a7267; Works V 326\u201328).\n\n\nGreen\u2019s liberalism is a perfectionist liberalism in which the\nstate aims to promote the self-realization of its citizens, and this\ngives the state a number of positive duties in relation to its\ncitizens. But the importance of autonomy to self-realization means\nthat the state\u2019s positive role is restricted to\nenabling its citizens to perfect themselves.\n\n\n[I]t is the business of the state, not indeed directly to promote\nmoral goodness, for that, from the very nature of moral goodness, it\ncannot do, but to maintain the conditions without which a free\nexercise of the human faculties is impossible. (\u201cLiberal\nLegislation,\u201d Works III 374)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s claim here bears comparison with Kant\u2019s insistence\nin the Metaphysics of Morals on a self/other asymmetry in\nwhich we must aim at our own perfection but at the happiness, rather\nthan the perfection, of others. In explaining this asymmetry, Kant\nwrites:\n\n\nSo too, it is a contradiction for me to make another\u2019s\nperfection my end and consider myself under an obligation to\npromote this. For the perfection of another human being, as a\nperson, consists just in this: that he himself is able to set\nhis end in accordance with his own conception of duty; and it is\nself-contradictory to require that I do (make it my duty to do)\nsomething that only the other himself can do. (6: 386)\n\n\nGreen makes sense of Kant\u2019s admonitions against aiming at the\nperfection of another by interpreting them as constraints on\nhow we aim at the perfection of others (Brink 2019:\n12\u201315). Given the role of one\u2019s own agency in one\u2019s\nperfection, I can\u2019t perfect others any more than I can win\ncompetitive races for them. But just as I can help another to win a\nrace by training with her, discussing strategy, and sharing\nnutritional tips, so too I can help others perfect themselves by\nhelping them develop their normative competence and deliberating with\nthem, identifying options, discussing the comparative merits of these\noptions, and providing them with opportunities to exercise their\nnormative powers. I can help others perfect themselves, just not in\nways that bypass their agency. In this way, the state can and should\npromote the self-realization of its citizens by enabling, rather than\ncoercing, them.\n\nThough the Old Liberals see themselves as the advocates of freedom,\nGreen thinks that the New Liberals have a claim to beings liberals in\nthe fullest sense, because only a mix of negative and positive reforms\ncan enable the perfection and self-realization of its citizens and,\nhence, true freedom.\n",
