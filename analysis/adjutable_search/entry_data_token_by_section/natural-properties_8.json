    "main_text": "Related uses of \u2018natural\u2019 || Natural kinds\n3.6 Natural kinds\n\nAnother category whose relation to classes, properties, and concepts\nis contested is that of kinds. To judge by how we talk, kinds\nseem more \u201cconcrete\u201d than properties: compare \u2018I\nused to drive that kind of car\u2019 versus \u2018I used to drive\nthat property\u2019 (see Carlson\n 1977).\n Further complicating the relationship is the fact that the notion\n\u2018natural kind\u2019 is the topic of a body of literature large\nenough to be the topic of a separate entry\n (natural kinds).\n This literature, which traces back at least to the discussion of\n\u201cKinds\u201d by Mill\n (1843),\n is guided by a set of paradigms rather different from those that\nguide the literature on natural properties. For example, following\nMill, it is widely denied that there is a natural kind to which all\nand only white things belong, on the grounds that they have\nnothing else important in common other than their color. So\neven if one identified kinds with properties, there would be a case\nfor distinguishing the senses of \u2018natural\u2019 in\n\u2018natural property\u2019 and \u2018natural kind\u2019 (see\nTobin\n 2013).\n Of course this does not rule out analysing one of the notions in\nterms of the other: for example, being a very natural kind might\nrequire being coextensive with several different sufficiently natural\nproperties that are probabilistically correlated given the actual laws\nof nature, but not necessarily equivalent (c.f. Boyd\n 1991).\n",
