    "main_text": "Ethics, Part One: What Justice Is || Introducing Virtuous Motivations\n2.2 Introducing Virtuous Motivations\n\n\nIn Book Four, Socrates defines each of the cardinal virtues in terms \nof the complicated psychology he has just sketched. A person is wise \njust in case her rational attitudes are functioning well, so that her\nrational part \u201chas in it the knowledge of what is advantageous for \neach part [of the soul] and for the whole in common of the three \nparts\u201d (442c5\u20138). So the unwise person has a faulty conception of \nwhat is good for him. A person is courageous just in case her \nspirited attitudes do not change in the face of pains and pleasures \nbut stay in agreement with what is rationally recognized as fearsome \nand not (442bc). So the coward will, in the face of prospective \npains, fail to bear up to what he rationally believes is not \ngenuinely fearsome, and the rash person will, in the face of \nprospective pleasures, rush headlong into what he rationally believes\nto be fearsome. A person is temperate or moderate just in case the \ndifferent parts of her soul are in agreement. So the intemperate \nperson has appetitive or spirited attitudes in competition with the \nrational attitudes, appetitive or spirited attitudes other than those\nthe rational attitudes deem to be good. Finally, a person is just \njust in case all three parts of her soul are functioning as they \nshould (441d12\u2013e2; cf. 443c9\u2013e2). Justice, then, requires the other \nvirtues. So the \nunjust person fails to be moderate, or fails to be wise, or fails to \nbe courageous.\n\n\nActually, the relation among the virtues seems tighter than that, for\nit seems that the unjust person necessarily fails to be wise, \ncourageous, and temperate (cf. Cooper 1998). You might try to deny this. You \nmight say that a person could be courageous\u2014with spirited \nattitudes that track perfectly what the rational attitudes say is \nfearsome and not, in the face of any pleasures and pains\u2014but \nstill be unjust insofar has her rational attitudes are inadequately \ndeveloped, failing to know what really is fearsome. But Socrates \nseems to balk at this possibility by contrasting the civically \ncourageous whose spirit preserves law-inculcated beliefs about what \nis fearsome and not and the genuinely courageous in whom, presumably,\nspirit preserves knowledge about what is fearsome and not (430a\u2013c). \nSo you might say instead that a person could be \nmoderate\u2014utterly without appetitive attitudes at odds with what\nhis rational attitudes say is good for him\u2014but still be unjust \ninsofar as his rational attitudes are inadequately developed and fail\nto know what really is good. But this picture of a meek, but moderate\nsoul seems to sell short the requirements of moderation, which are \nnot merely that there be no insurrections in the soul but also that \nthere be agreement that the rational attitudes should rule. This \nwould seem to require that there actually be appetitive attitudes \nthat are in agreement with the rational attitudes\u2019 conception of what\nis good, which would in turn require that the rational attitudes be \nsufficiently strong to have a developed conception of what is good. \nMoreover, it would seem to require that the rational attitudes which \nendorse ruling be ruling, which would in turn require that the \nrational attitudes are at least on the path toward determining what \nreally is good for the person. If these considerations are correct, \nthen the unjust are lacking in virtue tout court, whereas \nthe just possess all of the virtues.\n\n\nAfter sketching these four virtues in Book Four, Socrates is ready to\nmove from considering what justice is in a person to why a person \nshould be just (444e). But this is premature. Socrates is moving to \nshow that it is always better to have a just soul, but he was asked \nto show that it is always better to be the person who does just \nactions. We might doubt that an answer concerning psychological \njustice is relevant to the question concerning practical justice (Sachs 1963).\n\n\nIt is easy to misstate this objection (Demos 1964, Dahl 1991). The problem is not that the \nquestion is about justice as it is ordinarily understood and Socrates\nis failing to address conventional justice. Neither the question nor \nthe answer is bound to how justice is ordinarily understood, given \nwhat happened in Book One. Moreover, the problem is not that \nSocrates\u2019 answer is relevant only if the class of the psychologically\njust and the class of the practically just are coextensive. That \nwould require Socrates to show that everyone who acts justly has a \njust soul, and Socrates quite reasonably shows no inclination for \nthat thesis. (Some people do what is right for the wrong reasons.) He may have to establish some connection \nbetween doing just actions and becoming psychologically just if he is\nto give reasons to those who are not yet psychologically just to do \njust actions, but an account of habituation would be enough to do \nthis (cf. 443e, 444c\u2013d).\n\n\nThe real problem raised by the objection is this: how can Socrates \njustify the claim that people with just souls are practically just? \nFirst, he must be able to show that the psychologically just refrain \nfrom injustice, and second, he must be able to show that the \npsychologically just do what is required by justice. The first point \nreceives a gesture when Socrates is trying to secure the claim that \nharmonious functioning of the whole soul really deserves to be called\njustice (442e\u2013443a), but he offers no real argument. Perhaps the best\nwe can do on his behalf is to insist that the first point is not a \nthesis for argument but a bold empirical hypothesis. On this view, it\nis simply an empirical question whether all those who have the \nmotivations to do unjust things happen to have souls that are out of \nbalance, and an army of psychologists would be needed to answer the \nquestion.\n\n\nThat might seem bad enough, but the second point does not even receive\na gesture. There is no denying the presence of this second requirement\non the grounds that justice is a matter of refraining from harm\n(\u201cnegative duties\u201d) and not of helping others\n(\u201cpositive duties\u201d). Socrates does not criticize the Book\nOne suggestion that justice requires helping friends (332a ff.); he\nand his interlocutors agree that justice requires respect for parents\nand care for the gods (443a); and they treat the principle that each\nshould do his job (and thereby contribute to the city) as the image of\njustice (443c). So according to Plato\u2019s Republic justice\nincludes both negative and positive duties.\n\n\nBefore we can consider Socrates\u2019 answer to the question of the \nRepublic, we must have reason to accept that those who have \nharmonious souls do what is required by justice. Otherwise, we cannot\nbe sure that psychological harmony is justice. Unfortunately, \nSocrates does not give any explicit attention to this worry at the \nend of Book Four or in the argument of Books Eight and Nine. But \nthere are other places to look for a solution to this worry. First, \nwe might look to Books Five through Seven. Second, we might look to \nBooks Two and Three.\n",
