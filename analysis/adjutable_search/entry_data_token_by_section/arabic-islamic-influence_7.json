    "main_text": "Psychology\n5. Psychology\n\nIn Latin psychology, the influence of Arabic works is particularly\nstrong and lasted well into the sixteenth century. Avicenna and\nAverroes, the most influential philosophers, presented the West with a\nfaculty psychology in the tradition of Aristotle and enriched by\nGraeco-Arabic medical doctrines, such as about the cavities of the\nbrain, the nerves, and the spirits which transport information in the\nbody. From about 1220 onwards, the full range of Avicennian faculties\n(vegetative, external and internal senses, the motive faculties,\npractical and theoretical intellect) appears in Latin treatises by\nmasters of arts and theologians. This system of faculties remains, by\nand large, standard for a long time in philosophical handbooks, from\nthe anonymous Philosophy of the Simple (Philosophia\npauperum) and Vincent of Beauvais\u2019 Mirror of\nNature (Speculum naturale) in the thirteenth century up\nto the Philosophic Pearl (Margarita philosophica) of\nthe 1490s. Also influential was Avicenna\u2019s definition of the\nsoul as a separate substance (Hasse 2008) and his thought experiment of the\n\u201cFlying Man\u201d (Hasse 2000, 80\u201392).\n\nAverroes disagreed with Avicenna on a number of topics concerning\nfaculty psychology, for example: on the organ and medium of touch, on\nthe material or immaterial transmission of odors, and on whether human\nbeings have an estimative faculty or not. These controversies were\ncontinued in the Latin tradition. The most influential pieces of\npsychological doctrine imported from the Arabs probably were\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of estimation (wahm), his theory of\npotential, acquired and active intellects, and Averroes\u2019 thesis\nthat there is one intellect for all human beings.\n",
