    "main_text": "Philosophical Analysis\n4. Philosophical Analysis\n\n\nBy the time Moore returned to Cambridge in 1911 to a lectureship\nthere, Russell\u00a0 and Whitehead were finishing off their massive\nproject of exhibiting the logical foundations of mathematics \u2014\nPrincipia Mathematica. Although Moore was neither a\nmathematician nor a logical theorist he was one of the first people to\ngrasp that Russell's new logical theory was an essential tool for\nphilosophy and offered important new insights. One example of this\nconcerns the status of propositions, the \u2018objects\u2019 of\nthought. As we saw above, in his early work Moore had been emphatic\nthat propositions are altogether independent of thought and had even\nproposed that facts are just true propositions. But as he came to think\nmore about falsehood in his lectures Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy of 1910\u201311, it became clear to him that this\nposition was a mistake, since the truth of a proposition should not\naffect its\u00a0 ontological status and yet it would be absurd to give\nfalse propositions the status of facts. So he now rejected the view\nthat facts are just true propositions. On his new view, facts are, as\nbefore, constituted by objects and their properties; but what about\npropositions? According to Moore, philosophers talk legitimately of\npropositions in order to identify the aspects of thought and language\nwhich are crucial to questions of truth and inference, and in doing so\nit may appear that they regard propositions as genuine entities. But,\nMoore now holds, this implication is unwarranted: the mistake here is\none of supposing that \u2018every expression which seems to be a name\nof something must be so in fact\u2019 (Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy, 266). Moore does not allude here explicitly to\nRussell's theory of incomplete symbols and logical fictions, but it is\nclear that this is the kind of position he has in mind. The new logic\nenables one to preserve realist appearances without accepting realist\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nYet Moore was not an uncritical follower of Russell. He was critical\nof Russell's account of implication in which Russell proposes that the\ntruth-functional conditional expresses all there is to the logical\nrelationship of implication between propositions, and introduced\ninstead the term \u2018entailment\u2019 for this latter relationship\n(\u2018External and Internal Relations\u2019 90ff.). While\nrecognising that entailment is closely connected to logical necessity\nhe came to think that entailment is not just a matter of the necessity\nof the truth-functional conditional, thereby setting off a debate about\nthis relationship which continues to this day. Again, Moore was\ncritical of Russell's treatment of existence, in particular his denial\nthat it makes sense to treat existence as a first-order predicate of\nparticular objects (for Russell, existence has to be expressed by the\nexistential quantifier and is therefore a second-order predicate of\npredicates). While agreeing with Russell that existence is not a\nstraightforward first-order predicate (so that the logical form of\n\u2018Tame tigers exist\u2019 is not the same as that of \u2018Tame\ntigers growl\u2019), Moore argued that statements such as \u2018This\nmight not exist\u2019 make perfectly good sense and that they could\nnot do so unless the simpler statement \u2018This exists\u2019 also\nmakes sense (\u2018Is Existence a Predicate?\u2019 145).\n\n\nMoore's uses of Russell's logic take place in the broader context of\nhis use of analysis as a method of philosophy. Although Moore always\ndenied that philosophy is just analysis, there is no denying that it\nplays a central role in his philosophy and it is therefore important to\ndetermine what motivates this role. This question is especially\npressing in Moore's case because he rejected the main analytical\nprogrammes of twentieth century philosophy \u2014 both Wittgenstein's\nlogical atomism and the logical empiricism of the members of the Vienna\ncircle and their followers such as A. J. Ayer. In the first case, Moore\nrejected Wittgenstein's thesis that whatever exists exists necessarily;\nas with the idealist thesis that all relations are internal, Moore held\nthat our common sense conviction that some of the things which exist\nmight not have done so creates a strong presumption against any\nphilosopher who maintains the opposite, and that the logical atomist\nposition does not provide convincing reasons why this presumption\nshould be overturned. In addition Moore held that it is just not true\nthat all necessity is logical necessity, as Wittgenstein maintained; in\nhis early writings, despite his hostility to Kant, he had explicitly\ndefended the conception of necessary synthetic truths and he did not\nchange his mind on this point. This point also provides a reason for\nhis rejection of logical empiricism, since this position famously\nincludes the thesis that all necessary truths are\n\u2018analytic\u2019. But Moore also recognised that his early\ncriticisms of William James' pragmatism can be applied to the logical\nempiricist position. In connection with James, Moore had observed that\nwhere a proposition concerns the past, it may well be that we are in a\nsituation in which a proposition and its negation are both unverifiable\nbecause there is now no evidence either way on the matter. But, he\nargued, it does not follow that we cannot now affirm that either the\nproposition or its negation is true, thanks to the Law of Excluded\nMiddle; in which case it cannot be that truth is verifiability \u2014\ncontrary both to James' pragmatism and to logical empiricism.\n\n\nYet why then did Moore think that the analysis of propositions was\nso important? In part his motivation derives from his acceptance of a\nprinciple which Russell had introduced \u2014 that \u2018every\nproposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted\u2019 (Russell 91). For this\nprinciple motivates the \u2018sense-datum analysis\u2019 of\nperception to which he devoted so much attention and which I shall\ndiscuss in a moment. In addition, when explaining the importance of\nphilosophical analysis, he emphasized the importance of getting clear\nwhat is at issue in some debate; but an issue which he himself was not\nclear about was that of the implications of an analysis. In his early\nwritings he took the view that in so far as the analysis of a\nproposition clarifies it, it also clarifies its ontological\nimplications; thus he then held it to be an objection to a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about material objects that the\nanalysis calls into question the existence of such objects. But he\nlater took the opposite point of view, maintaining that a phenomenalist\nanalysis just provides an account of what their existence amounts to.\nIn between these two positions, in his 1925 paper \u2018A Defence of\nCommon Sense\u2019 (which I discuss further below), Moore had held\nthat what the sense-datum analysis of perception shows is that\nsense-data are the \u2018principal or ultimate subject<s>\u2019\n(128) of propositions about perception. This remark, I think, reflects\nthe true importance of philosophical analysis for Moore: its importance\nfor him is metaphysical in so far as it reveals the\n\u2018ultimate\u2019 substances which are the subjects of our\nordinary common sense thought and talk.\n",
