For example, in contemporary discussions of aboriginal\nsovereignty, rather than making claims based on premises about the\nvalue of Native cultures and their connection to individual members\u2019\nsense of self-worth as liberal multiculturalists have, the focus is on\nreckoning with history. Such proponents of indigenous sovereignty\nemphasize the importance of understanding indigenous claims against\nthe historical background of the denial of equal sovereign status of\nindigenous groups, the dispossession of their lands, and the\ndestruction of their cultural practices (Ivison 2006, Ivison et al.\n2000, Moore 2005, Simpson 2000). This background calls into question\nthe legitimacy of the state\u2019s authority over aboriginal peoples and\nprovides a prima facie case for special rights and protections for\nindigenous groups, including the right of self-government. Jeff\nSpinner-Halev has argued that the history of state oppression of a\ngroup should be a key factor in determining not only whether group\nrights should be extended but also whether the state should intervene\nin the internal affairs of the group when it discriminates against\nparticular members of the group. For example, \u201cwhen an oppressed\ngroup uses its autonomy in a discriminatory way against women it\ncannot simply be forced to stop this discrimination\u201d (2001, 97).\nOppressed groups that lack autonomy should be \u201cprovisionally\nprivileged\u201d over non-oppressed groups; this means that\n\u201cbarring cases of serious physical harm in the name of a group\u2019s\nculture, it is important to consider some form of autonomy for the\ngroup\u201d (2001, 97; see also Spinner-Halev 2012).\n\nTheorists adopting a postcolonial perspective go beyond liberal\nmulticulturalism toward the goal of developing models of\nconstitutional and political dialogue that recognize culturally\ndistinct ways of speaking and acting. Multicultural societies consist\nof diverse religious and moral outlooks, and if liberal societies are\nto take such diversity seriously, they must recognize that liberalism\nis just one of many substantive outlooks based on a specific view of\nman and society. Liberalism is not free of culture but expresses a\ndistinctive culture of its own. This observation applies not only\nacross territorial boundaries between liberal and nonliberal states,\nbut also within liberal states and its relations with nonliteral\nminorities. James Tully has surveyed the language of historical and\ncontemporary constitutionalism with a focus on Western state\u2019s\nrelations with Native peoples to uncover more inclusive bases for\nintercultural dialogue (1995). Bhikhu Parekh contends that liberal\ntheory cannot provide an impartial framework governing relations\nbetween different cultural communities (2000). He argues instead for a\nmore open model of intercultural dialogue in which a liberal society\u2019s\nconstitutional and legal values serve as the initial starting point\nfor cross-cultural dialogue while also being open to contestation.\n\n\nMore recent work has emphasized the importance of developing more contextual approaches that engage with actual political struggles for recognition and give greater voice to minority groups. Through detailed examination of how national museums in Canada and the U.S. have sought to represent and recognize indigenous groups, Caitlin Tom identifies three principles for the practice of recognition: self-definition, responsiveness, and internal contestation. Whether it be museum officials seeking to exhibit the history and culture of minority groups or government officials deciding whether official apologies for historical injustices are in order, they should respect individual and collective self-definition, respond to demands for recognition on terms that align with the terms of those being recognized, and accommodate internal contestation of group meanings. As Tom argues, practices of recognition guided by these principles come closer to fostering freedom and equality of minority groups than existing approaches (2018).\n",
