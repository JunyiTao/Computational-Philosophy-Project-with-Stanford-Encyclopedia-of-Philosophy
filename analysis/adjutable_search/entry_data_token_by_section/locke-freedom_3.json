    "main_text": "Free Will\n5. Free Will\nIs the will free? This question made sense to Scholastic\nphilosophers (including, e.g., Bramhall, who engaged in a protracted\ndebate on the subject with Hobbes), who tended not to distinguish\nbetween the question of whether the will is free and the question of\nwhether the mind or soul is free with respect to willing, and, indeed,\nsome of whom thought that acts cannot themselves be free (or freely\ndone) unless the will to do them is itself free. But, according to\nLocke, the question, if literally understood, \u201cis altogether\nimproper\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.14: 240). This follows directly from\nLocke\u2019s account of the will and his account of freedom. The will\nis a power (in E2\u20135, the power to order the motion or rest of\none\u2019s body and the power to order the consideration or\nnon-consideration of an idea\u2014see Section 2\nabove), and freedom is a power, namely the power to do or not do as\none wills (see Section 4 above). But, as Locke\nemphasizes, the question of whether one power has another power is\n\u201ca Question at first sight too grosly absurd to make a Dispute,\nor need an Answer\u201d. The reason is that it is absurd to suppose\nthat powers are capable of having powers, for\n\nPowers belong only to Agents, and are Attributes\nonly of Substances, and not of Powers themselves.  (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.16: 241)\nThe question of whether the will is free, then, presupposes that\nthe will is a substance, rather than a power, and therefore makes no\nmore sense than the question of whether a man\u2019s \u201cSleep be\nSwift, or his Vertue square\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.14: 240). To suppose\nthat the will is free (or unfree!) is therefore to make a category\nmistake (see Ryle 1949: chapter 1).\n",
