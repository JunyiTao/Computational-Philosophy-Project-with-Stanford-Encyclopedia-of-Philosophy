    "main_text": "Group-Based Accounts of Moral Status || Humanity as the Ground of Full Moral Status\n6. Conclusion\n\nThere seems to be little prospect for consensus on the moral status of\npeople with the most severe cognitive disabilities. There are sharp\ndisagreements about how, or even whether, the moral status of humans\ncan be grounded, and about the weight to be given our strongest and\nmost considered, moral convictions. Accounts that ground full moral\nstatus in an individual\u2019s possession of psychological attributes\ninevitably exclude some portion of humanity, and appear to have\nimplications for the treatment of the excluded human beings that few\nof us are willing to accept. Those implications are avoided by\naccounts that ground full moral status in our species\nmembership\u2014in the nature of the species or in our biological\nrelationships to other members. Those implications are also avoided by\naccounts that deny the need to ground the moral status of human beings\nin any attribute we or our group possesses. But these ways of avoiding\nexclusion have significant costs. They require a strong partiality\ntoward those with shared biological features, physical appearances, or\norigins, a partiality that conflicts with equally strong, if more\nabstract convictions about the justification for our conduct towards\nothers. And they leave deep uncertainty about the moral constraints on\nour treatment of other living beings and about the boundaries of\nhumanity itself.\n\nDespite the serious challenges facing both approaches, and the\nformidable obstacles to reaching any sort of consensus, the discussion\nabout the moral status of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities is a central one for applied ethics. It needs to\ncontinue.\n",
