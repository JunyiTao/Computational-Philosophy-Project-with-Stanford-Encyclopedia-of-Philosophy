    "main_text": "Arkansas\n4. Arkansas\n\nGenesis Flood enjoyed massive popularity among the faithful,\nand led to a thriving Creation Science Movement, where Morris\nparticularly and his coworkers and believers \u2013 notably Duane T.\nGish, author of Evolution: The Fossils Say No! \u2013 pushed\nthe literalist line. Particularly effective was their challenging of\nevolutionists to debate, where they would employ every rhetorical\ntrick in the book, reducing the scientists to fury and impotence, with\nbold statements (provocatively made most often by Gish) about the\nsupposed nature of the universe (Gilkey 1985; Ruse (ed.) 1988). This all\nculminated eventually in a court case in Arkansas. By the end of the\n1970s, Creationists were passing around draft bills, intended for\nstate legislatures, that would allow \u2013 insist on \u2013 the\nteaching of Creationism in state-supported public schools. In the\nbiology classes of such schools, that is. By this time it was realized\nthat, thanks to Supreme Court rulings on the First Amendment to the\nConstitution (that which prohibits the establishment of state\nreligion), it was not possible to exclude the teaching of evolution\nfrom such schools. The trick was to get Creationism \u2013 something\nthat prima facie rides straight through the separation of\nchurch and state \u2013 into such schools. The idea of Creation\nScience is to do this. The claim is that, although the science\nparallels Genesis, as a matter of scientific fact, it stands alone as\ngood science. Hence, these draft bills proposed what was called:\n\u2018Balanced treatment.\u2019 If one were to teach the\n\u2018evolution model,\u2019 then one had also to teach the\n\u2018Creation Science model.\u2019 Sauce for the evolutionist goose\nis also sauce for the Creationist gander. \n\nIn 1981, these drafts found a taker in Arkansas, where such a bill was\npassed and signed into law \u2013 as it happens, by a legislature and\ngovernor that thought little of what they were doing until the\nconsequences were drawn to their attention. (William Clinton was\ngovernor from 1978 to 1980, and again from 1982 to his winning of the\npresidency, in 1992. The law was passed during the interregnum.) At\nonce the American Civil Liberties Union sprang into action, bringing\nsuit on grounds of the law\u2019s unconstitutionality. The theologian\nLangdon Gilkey, the geneticist Francisco Ayala, the paleontologist\nStephen Jay Gould, and as the philosophical representative Michael\nRuse appeared as expert witnesses, arguing that Creationism has no\nplace in state supported biology classes. The state\u2019s position was not\nexactly helped when one of its witnesses (Norman Geisler, a\ntheologian) admitted under cross-examination to his belief in UFOs as\na satanic manifestation. Hardly surprisingly, evolution won. The judge\nruled firmly that Creation Science is not science, it is religion, and\nas such has no place in public classrooms. The judge (William Overton)\nruled that the \u2018essential characteristics\u2019 of what makes\nsomething scientific are:\n\nIt is guided by natural law;\nIt has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;\nIt is testable against the empirical world;\nIts conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final\nword; and\nIt is falsifiable.\n\n\nIn the judge\u2019s opinion, Creation Science fails on all counts, and that\napparently was an end to matters. In 1987 this whole matter was\ndecided decisively in the same way, by the Supreme Court, in a similar\ncase involving Louisiana. (See Ruse (ed.) 1988, for an edited\ncollection that reproduces many of the pertinent documents, including\nstate bills, as well as witness testimony and the judge\u2019s\nruling.) \n\nOf course, in real life nothing is ever that simple, and Arkansas was\ncertainly not the end of matters. One of the key issues in the trial\nwas less theological or scientific, but philosophical. (Paradoxically,\nthe ACLU had significant doubts about using a philosophical witness and\nonly decided at the last minute to bring Michael Ruse to the stand. As\nit happens, as the judge\u2019s ruling shows, the philosophical testimony\nproved crucial.) Look again at the fifth of the judge\u2019s criteria for\nwhat makes for good or genuine science. The Creationists had started\nto refer to the ideas of the eminent, Austrian-born, British-residing\nphilosopher\n Karl Popper\n (1959). As is well known, Popper claimed that for something to be\ngenuinely scientific it has to be falsifiable. By this, Popper meant\nthat genuine science puts itself up to check against the real world.\nIf the predictions of the science hold true, then it lives to fight\nanother day. If the predictions fail, then the science must be\nrejected \u2013 or at least revised. Popper (1974) himself expressed\ndoubts about whether evolutionary theory is genuinely falsifiable and\nhe rather inclined to think that it is less a description of reality\nthan a heuristic to further study, what he called a\n\u2018metaphysical research programme\u2019 (Ruse 1977). The\nCreationists seized on this and argued that they had the best\nauthority to reject evolution, or at least to judge it no more of a\nscience than Creationism. (To his credit, Popper revised his thinking\non Darwinian evolutionary theory and grew to see and admit that it was\na genuine scientific theory; see Popper 1978).\n\nPart of the testimony in Arkansas was designed to refute this\nargument, and it was shown that in fact evolution does indeed make\nfalsifiable claims. As we have already seen, natural selection is no\ntautology. If one could show that organisms did not exhibit\ndifferential reproduction \u2013 to take the example given above,\nthat all proto-humans had the same number of offspring \u2013 then\nselection theory would certainly be false. Likewise, if one could show\nthat human and dinosaur remains truly did occur in the same time\nstrata of the fossil record, one would have powerful proof against the\nthinking of modern evolutionists. This argument succeeded in court\n\u2013 the judge accepted that evolutionary thinking is falsifiable.\nConversely, he accepted that Creation Science is never truly open to\ncheck. On-the-spot, ad hoc hypotheses proliferate as soon as any of\nits claims are challenged. It is not falsifiable and hence not genuine\nscience. However, after the case a number of prominent philosophers\n(most notably the American Larry Laudan) objected strongly to the very\nidea of using falsifiability as a \u2018criterion of\ndemarcation\u2019 between science and non-science. They argued that\nin fact there is no hard and fast rule for distinguishing science from\nother forms of human activity, and that hence in this sense the\nCreationists might have a point (Ruse (ed.) 1988). Not that people like\nLaudan were themselves Creationists. They thought Creationism false.\nTheir objection was rather to trying to find some way of making\nevolution and not Creationism into a genuine science.\n\nDefenders of the anti-Creationism strategy taken in Arkansas argued,\nwith reason and law, that the United States Constitution does not bar\nthe teaching of false science. It bars the teaching of non-science,\nespecially non-science which is religion by another name. Hence, if\nthe objections of people like Laudan were taken seriously, the\nCreationists might have a case to make for the balanced treatment of\nevolution and Creationism. Popperian falsifiability may be a somewhat\nrough and ready way of separating science and religion, but it is good\nenough for the job at hand, and in law that is what counts. \n",
