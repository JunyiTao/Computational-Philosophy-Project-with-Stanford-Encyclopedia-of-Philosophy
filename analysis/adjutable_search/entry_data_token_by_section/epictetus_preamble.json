    "main_text": "\n\nA Greek philosopher of 1st and early 2nd\ncenturies C.E., and an exponent of Stoic ethics notable for the\nconsistency and power of his ethical thought and for effective methods\nof teaching. Epictetus\u2019s chief concerns are with integrity,\nself-management, and personal freedom, which he advocates by demanding\nof his students a thorough examination of two central ideas, the\ncapacity he terms \u2018volition\u2019 (prohairesis) and\nthe correct use of impressions (chr\u0113sis t\u014dn\nphantasi\u014dn), Heartfelt and satirical by turns, Epictetus has\nhad significant influence on the popular moralistic tradition, but he\nis more than a moralizer; his lucid resystematization and challenging\napplication of Stoic ethics qualify him as an important philosopher in\nhis own right.\n",
