Christian August Crusius\n\nAs Baumgarten sought in a conciliatory spirit to make the Wolffian\nphilosophy responsive to Pietist concerns, Christian August Crusius\nmounted a renewed, Pietist-inspired but philosophically-sophisticated\nassault on the foundations of that system. Through his dissertations\nand textbooks, Crusius succeeded in raising trenchant objections to\nthe Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, and indeed to the strongest forms\nof philosophical rationalism, and he formulated an influential and\nsystematic alternative in which the will and its freedom are central\nconcerns.\n",
