    "main_text": "A posteriori arguments || The classical cosmological argument\n3.1 The classical cosmological argument\n\nAn a posteriori argument involves at least one premise whose\njustification essentially appeals to some sort of empirical fact or\nexperience. The main demonstrative a posteriori argument is\nwhat Kant dubbed \u201cthe cosmological argument\u201d. It is\nmotivated by the familiar question \u201cWhy is there something\nrather than nothing?\u201d and goes from the empirical fact of the\nexistence of something (or of the cosmos as a whole, perhaps) to the\nexistence of a first cause or ground of that cosmos that is, at least\nin part, not identical to that cosmos. Cosmological arguments are\nfound across almost every philosophical tradition, and find prominence\nin the West in the writings of Aristotle, Avicenna,\nal-Gh&amacr;z&amacr;li, Maimonides, Aquinas, Locke, Leibniz, Samuel\nClarke, and David Hume. Here we will start with Avicenna, but then\nfocus largely on the early modern period.\n\nAvicenna (980\u20131037), whose Arabic name is Ibn Sina, sets out\ncosmological arguments in a number of works, but a detailed version is\nfound in his Remarks and Admonitions (Kitab al-Isharat wa\nl-Tanbihat) (Avicenna [ISR]; Mayer 2001). He begins with a claim\nabout contingently existing things: since it is possible for a\ncontingent thing either to exist or not to exist, whether it exists or\nnot hangs in the balance. But then, if a contingent thing does exist,\nthere must be something external to it, a cause, that accounts for its\nexisting rather than not. This establishes a principle crucial to the\nargument: \u201cthe existence of every contingent is from other than\nit.\u201d\n\nAvicenna next considers the aggregate of all the existing contingent\nindividual things, the existence of each of which is accounted for by\nits causal antecedents. He then proposes and evaluates four options\nfor accounting for the aggregate\u2019s existence. The first is that\nthe existence of the aggregate does not require a cause. However,\ngiven the principle that the existence of any contingent thing must\nhave a cause, the aggregate would then have to exist necessarily. But\nthe aggregate\u2019s existing necessarily is ruled out by the fact\nthat all of the individuals in it are contingent things. On the second\noption, the cause of the existence of the aggregate is \u201cthe\nindividuals all together.\u201d But then the aggregate would cause\nitself to exist, which is ruled out by the principle that the\nexistence of any contingent thing requires a cause other than it. The\nthird option is that the cause of the aggregate is one of the\nindividuals in it. But all of those individuals are caused to exist by\nother things in the aggregate, so no one individual is qualified to be\nthe cause of the existence of the entire aggregate. The only remaining\noption is that the existence of the aggregate has a cause external to\nthe aggregate. Because all of the contingently existing things are in\nthe aggregate, the cause must be a necessarily existing thing (Mayer\n2001). Avicenna is fully aware that the argument shouldn\u2019t end\nhere, since it must be shown that the necessarily existing thing is\nGod, and he provides a number of considerations in favor of this claim\n(Adamson 2013).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s cosmological argument from the contingency of the\nworld contrasts with another major type of argument for God\u2019s\nexistence in Islamic natural theology, one that aims to demonstrate\nthe existence of God from the beginning of the world in time.\nAl-Ghazali (1056-1111), in The Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers, develops this type of argument in two steps. The\nfirst aims to establish, against a prominent Aristotelian tradition,\nthat the world is not eternal but has a beginning in time. The second\nstep reasons that for any being that begins to exist at a time, there\nmust be something that determines that it comes to exist at that time.\nAnd thus, because the world begins to exist at a time, there must be\nsomething which determines that it comes to exist at that time. As\nal-Ghazali puts it, \u201cevery being which begins has a cause for\nits beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it\npossesses a cause for its beginning.\u201d He then argues that it\nmust be God who by free choice determines that the world comes to\nexist at the time it does, and we can thus conclude that God exists.\nThese argumentative themes are characteristic features of the\nAsh\u2019arite theological tradition in Islam; in recent times,\nal-Ghazali\u2019s argument has been defended by William Lane Craig\n(1979).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s cosmological argument (Leibniz 1697 [PE]:\n149\u201355; 1714 [PP]: 646, [PE]: 218\u201319) does not assume or\nattempt to establish that the world, the collection of all actual\ncontingent beings, has a beginning in time, and in this respect it\nmore closely resembles Avicenna\u2019s argument than\nal-Ghazali\u2019s. Leibniz argues as follows: suppose that in fact\nthe world has no beginning in time, and that each being in the world\nhas an explanation in some previously existing being(s). Two demands\nfor explanation might still arise: Why is there a world at all rather\nthan none? and: Why does this world exist and not some other world?\nNeither explanation can be provided by appealing solely to entities\nwithin the world (or within time). Leibniz\u2019s conclusion is that\nthere must be a being that is not merely hypothetically, but\nabsolutely necessary, and whose own explanation is contained\nwithin itself. This being is God. (A similar cosmological argument is\nadvanced around the same time by Samuel Clarke (1705), see also the\nentry on\n Samuel Clarke).\n\nDavid Hume puts forward three main objections to the type of\ncosmological argument offered by Leibniz and Clarke (Hume 1779, Part\nIX, and the entry\n Hume on religion).\n The first is that the notion of (absolutely) necessary existence\nitself is problematic. Suppose that some being is absolutely\nnecessary\u2014then its nonexistence should be absolutely\ninconceivable. But, says Hume, for any being whose existence we can\nconceive, we can also conceive its nonexistence, and thus it\nisn\u2019t a necessary being. Hume anticipates the objection that if\nwe truly understood the divine nature, we would be unable to conceive\nGod\u2019s nonexistence. He replies that an analogous point can be\nmade about matter: for all we know, if we truly understood the nature\nof matter, we would be unable to conceive its nonexistence. This would\nshow that the existence of matter is not contingent after all, and\nthat it does not require an external explanation. Thus, by parity, the\ncosmological argument does not establish that God is the necessary\nbeing who is responsible for the rest of the cosmos.\n\nHume\u2019s second objection is that God cannot be the causal\nexplanation of the existence of a series of contingent beings that has\nno temporal beginning, since any causal relation \u201cimplies a\npriority in time and a beginning of existence\u201d (Hume 1779, Part\nIV). In reply, it seems quite possible to conceive of a non-temporal\ncausal relation, and thus to conceive of God, from outside of time,\ncausing a series of contingent beings that has always existed. Indeed,\nthis view is common in the theological tradition. Moreover, as Kant\nalong with numerous contemporary metaphysicians argue, we can\ncoherently conceive of a relation of simultaneous causation.\nIf this is right, then even a God who is in time could ground the\nexistence of a series of contingent beings with no temporal beginning.\n\n\nHume\u2019s third objection is that in a causal series of contingent\nbeings without a temporal beginning, each being will have a causal\nexplanation by virtue of its predecessors. Since there is no first\nbeing, there will be a causal explanation for every contingent being\non the basis of previously existing contingent beings. However, if\neach individual contingent being has a causal explanation, then the\nentire causal series has an explanation. For wholes are nothing over\nand above their parts:\n\n\ndid I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. (Part IV) \n\n\nA reply to this last objection might be that even if one has explained\nin this way the existence of each individual in the contingent series,\none still has not answered the two questions mentioned earlier: Why is\nthere a world at all rather than none? and: Why does this world exist\nand not some other world? (for further discussion, see Rowe 1975;\nSwinburne 2004; Pruss 2006; O\u2019Connor 2008).\n\nKant, too, objects to the cosmological argument, but mainly on the\ngrounds that it delivers an object that is inadequate to the classical\nconception of God. Any effort to turn the ultimate ground into the\nmost perfect of all beings, Kant says, will have to smuggle in some\nsort of ontological argument (see Pasternack 2001; Forgie 2003; Proops\n2014; and the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion).\n\nIn general, objections to the cosmological argument (both historical\nand contemporary) take one of the following forms:\n\nnot every fact requires explanation, and the fact that the\ncosmological arguer is pointing to is one of those;\neach being in the cosmos has an explanation, but the cosmos as an\nentire series does not require an additional explanation,\nover and above the explanations of each member of the series;\nthe sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data\ncited by the cosmological arguer does not amount to a supernatural\nexplanation (e.g., the Big Bang could suffice);\nthe sort of explanation required to explain the empirical data\ncited by the cosmological arguer is not going to deliver anything as\naugust as the God of traditional religious doctrine but rather, in\nHume\u2019s terms, a somewhat \u201cmediocre deity\u201d.\n\n",
