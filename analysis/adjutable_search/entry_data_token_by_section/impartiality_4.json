    "main_text": "Moral impartiality I: Consequentialist moral theories || The nature of consequentialist impartiality\n3.1 The nature of consequentialist impartiality\n\nConsequentialist moral theories hold that moral evaluations and\njustifications must ultimately be grounded in the value of the\nconsequences of the actions, rules, policies, strategies, character\ntraits, etc. that are being evaluated (Hooker 1994). That is, the\nultimate question to be asked of any action, rule, or character trait\nunder evaluation is, \u201cDoes it [the action, rule, or trait in\nquestion] promote the good?\u201d For the purposes of this entry,\nthree important assumptions will be made regarding consequentialist\ntheories. First, consequentialist theories will be assumed to hold\nthat the overall values of sets of consequences can be determined, and\nthus ranked, independently of the identity of any particular agent.\nSecond, such theories will be assumed to hold that the impersonal good\nis largely if not entirely composed of the interests of individual\npersons, and that the interests of each person count for just as much\nas those of every other person. Finally, it will be assumed that we\nare dealing with act consequentialist theories \u2013 theories, that\nis, which hold that the consequentialist standard is to be applied\ndirectly to the actions of agents, and that what is required is that\nevery action (or overall pattern of action) maximize the impersonal\ngood. Such a theory, then, requires that every agent always choose an\naction that will bring about consequences at least as good as those\nthat would be brought about by any other available action.\n\nIn so characterizing consequentialism I am defining it as applying\ndirectly to the evaluation of an agent\u2019s actions. (It should be\npointed out that this still leaves it open whether or not an agent\nshould be motivated by explicit thoughts about\nconsequentialist requirements. It might be that an agent will perform\nbetter in terms of consequentialist standards if she is most often\nmoved by other sorts of considerations\u2014a point that is important\nto the sort of \u2018sophisticated\u2019 consequentialism advanced\nby Peter Railton, Frank Jackson, and others, and briefly discussed\nbelow.) One might instead adhere to a theory according to which\nfirst-order moral rules should be chosen in accordance with their\ntendency to promote the overall good, impartially (and impersonally)\nconceived. Such theories typically go by the name \u2018rule\nconsequentialism\u2019, though there has been some debate as to\nwhether they constitute genuinely consequentialist theories at all\n(Howard-Snyder 1993). For the purposes of understanding impartiality,\nat any rate, it is most useful to group rule consequentialist theories\nnot with act consequentialist theories but with deontological\ntheories, which are more similar in terms of their underlying\nnormative structure.\n\nAs we are understanding it, then, consequentialism seems to place each\nagent under a pervasive obligation to be strictly impartial between\nall persons, by requiring her always to exclude from her practical\ndeliberations (almost) all considerations that do not bear directly on\nthe ways in which people\u2019s interests might be advanced or\ninjured by her actions.\n\nThe consequentialist standard, then, is strictly impartial in a very\ndirect manner and in a very rigorous sense. A consequentialist agent\nis not permitted to prefer herself, nor any of her loved ones, in\nchoosing a distribution of benefits and burdens. She may not accept a\npleasure for herself if doing so involves passing up the opportunity\nto bring about a slightly larger pleasure for a stranger. Nor is she\npermitted to feed her own children if she could do more good by\nfeeding hungrier strangers instead. She must sacrifice the life of a\nspouse, parent or child if, by doing so, she would save more lives, or\neven (as in Godwin\u2019s Archbishop Fenelon case) save the life of\none other person whose contribution to the overall good would be\ngreater than that of the person sacrificed. It is for reasons such as\nthis that consequentialist impartiality is accused of being too\ndemanding. By refusing to allow the agent\u2019s personal concerns to\nplay a special role in her practical deliberations, it is claimed,\nconsequentialism threatens her integrity and alienates her from\nherself and others (Kapur 1991, Scheffler 1982, Stocker 1976, Williams\n1973, 1981). As Brian Barry has written, the effect of\nconsequentialist impartiality \u201cis, in effect, to extend to the\nwhole of conduct the requirements of impartiality that on the\ncommon-sense view are restricted to judges and bureaucrats acting in\ntheir official capacities\u201d (Barry 1995, 23).\n",
