    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Lewis produced a body of philosophical writing that, in four\nbooks and scores of articles, spanned every major philosophical area,\nwith perhaps the greatest concentration in metaphysics, philosophy of\nlanguage, philosophical logic, and philosophy of mind. Despite this\nastonishing variety, a newcomer to Lewis\u2019s philosophy would be\nbest advised to begin with his metaphysics (especially: 1986a, 1986e,\n1999). There are several reasons. First, the majority of Lewis\u2019s\nwork either concerns, or substantially overlaps, topics in\nmetaphysics. Second, the metaphysical positions Lewis stakes out are\nstrikingly original and powerfully argued. Third, there is a coherence\nand systematicity to this work that makes it a particularly\nappropriate object for study, in that one sees trademark Lewisian\nphilosophical maneuvers clearly on display. (Indeed, if one wished to\nlearn how to do philosophy in a Lewisian style, the most efficient way\nto do so would be to study his work in metaphysics.) Finally, and\nperhaps most interestingly, Lewis\u2019s metaphysics exerted a profound\nregulating influence on the rest of his philosophy: if some otherwise\nattractive position on some philosophical problem could not be made to\nsquare with his overall metaphysical outlook, then it would have to be\nabandoned.\n\nI should forestall one possible misunderstanding. You might think\nthat, given what I\u2019ve just said, the way Lewis would recommend\ndoing philosophy is as follows: First you figure out what your basic\nmetaphysical commitments should be; then you turn your attention to\nvarious broad but non-foundational philosophical subject matters\n(personal identity, mental content, the nature of knowledge, theory of\nvalue, etc.), and work out the consequences in each of these arenas of\nyour fundamental metaphysical posits. Nothing could be further from\nLewis\u2019s preferred methodology. (Well, maybe relying on divine\nrevelation would be further\u2026.) What he in fact recommends is a\nholistic approach: we start with the total body of claims we are\ninclined to believe\u2014whether on the basis of \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d (an oft-invoked category, for Lewis) or of\nscience\u2014and try our best to systematize it in\naccordance with standards of theoretical goodness that are themselves\nendorsed by common sense and/or science (and so are themselves, to\nsome extent, also up for grabs). A substantial portion of Lewis\u2019s\noverall body of philosophical work can thus be seen as an\nextended\u2014and breathtakingly ambitious\u2014attempt at achieving\ntotal reflective equilibrium. Here is an especially succinct\ndescription of this approach:\n\nOne comes to philosophy already endowed with a stock of opinions. It\nis not the business of philosophy either to undermine or to justify\nthese preexisting opinions, to any great extent, but only to try to\ndiscover ways of expanding them into an orderly system. (1973b, p. 88)\n\n\nStill, while Lewis\u2019s method of philosophical inquiry is certainly\nnot \u201cbottom-up\u201d, in my opinion it is best to present the\nresults of that inquiry in a bottom-up fashion. That is what\nthis essay, and ones to follow, will attempt to do. I will divide the\nterrain into four parts: Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology; his theory\nof metaphysical modality; his \u201capplied\u201d metaphysics\n(covering such topics as laws of nature, counterfactuals, causation,\nidentity through time, and the mind); and Lewisian methodology in\nmetaphysics. I\u2019ll explain these distinctions shortly, but be\nadvised that the present essay will almost exclusively address the\nfirst of these four topics. Other aspects of Lewis\u2019s thought are\ncovered in the general entry on\n David Lewis.\n",
