    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Argument from the Original Position: The Selection of Principles\n4.7 The Argument from the Original Position: The Selection of Principles\n\nThe argument from the original position has two parts. In the first\npart, the parties agree to principles of justice. In the second part,\nthe parties check that a society ordered by these principles could be\nstable over time. Rawls only attempts to show that his two principles\nof justice as fairness would be favored over utilitarian principles,\nsince he sees utilitarianism as the main competing tradition of\nreasoning about justice. The parties are thus presented with a choice\nbetween Rawls\u2019s two principles and utilitarian principles, and\nasked which principles they would prefer to agree to.\n\nThe first part of the original position contains two fundamental\ncomparisons between Rawls\u2019s principles and utilitarian\nprinciples. In the first comparison, the parties compare Rawls\u2019s\nprinciples to the principle of average utility: the principle\nthat the basic structure should be arranged so as to produce the\nhighest level of utility averaged among all citizens. Rawls argues\nthat the parties would favor his principles in this comparison,\nbecause the first principle of justice as fairness secures equal\nliberties for all citizens.\n\nIn this first comparison, Rawls argues that it is rational for the\nparties to use maximin reasoning: to maximize the minimum\nlevel of primary goods that the citizens they represent might find\nthemselves with. And maximin reasoning, he says, favors justice as\nfairness.\n\nUnder average utilitarianism, Rawls argues, the basic liberties of\nsome citizens might be restricted for the sake of greater benefits to\nother citizens. For example, restricting the political and religious\nliberties of a weak minority might work to the benefit of the\nmajority, and so produce a higher average level of utility in the\nsociety. A party in the original position will find the possibility\nthat their citizen might be denied political and religious liberties\nintolerable, given that the party could instead secure equal liberties\nfor their citizen by choosing justice as fairness. A party will not be\nwilling to gamble with the political standing and deepest commitments\nof the citizen they represent, Rawls says, when they could safeguard\nthe standing and commitments of their citizen even if their citizen\nturns out to be in a weak minority.\n\nMoreover, Rawls says, a society ordered by the principles of justice\nas fairness has other advantages over a utilitarian society. Securing\nequal basic liberties for all encourages a spirit of cooperation among\ncitizens on a basis of mutual respect, and takes divisive conflicts\nabout whether to deny liberties to some citizens off of the political\nagenda. By contrast, a utilitarian society would be riven by mutual\nsuspicions, as different groups put forward highly speculative\narguments that average utility could be increased by implementing\ntheir partisan policies. Rawls\u2019s first principle, by securing\npermanent equal liberties for all citizens, increases social harmony\nby making it easier for justice to be seen to be done. The balance of\nconsiderations in favor of justice as fairness over average utility\nhere is, Rawls claims, decisive.\n\nIn the second fundamental comparison, the parties are offered a choice\nbetween justice as fairness and the principle of restricted\nutility. The principle of restricted utility is identical to\nRawls\u2019s two principles, except that the difference principle is\nreplaced with a principle which says that the distribution of wealth\nand income should maximize average utility, constrained by a\nguaranteed minimum level of income for all. While the first comparison\nturned on the importance of the basic liberties, the second comparison\ncontains Rawls\u2019s formal argument for the difference\nprinciple.\n\nMaximin reasoning plays no role in the argument for the difference\nprinciple. Nor does aversion to uncertainty (JF, xvii, 43,\n95, 96).\n\nIn this second comparison, Rawls argues that the parties will favor\njustice as fairness because its principles provide a better basis for\nenduring cooperation among all citizens. The difference principle, he\nsays, asks less of the better-off than restricted utility asks of the\nworst-off. Under the difference principle, he says, those who are\nbetter endowed are permitted to gain more wealth and income, on the\ncondition that their doing so also benefits their fellow citizens.\nUnder restricted utility, by contrast, those living at the minimum\nwill suspect that their interests have been sacrificed to make the\nbetter-off better off still. These citizens at the minimum may become\ncynical about their society, and withdraw from active participation in\npublic life.\n\nMoreover, it is again difficult to maintain a public agreement as to\nwhich economic policies actually will maximize average utility, and\ndebates over where to set the guaranteed minimum may lead to mistrust\namong social classes. The difference principle instead encourages\nmutual trust and the cooperative virtues by instantiating an ideal of\neconomic reciprocity. Each party will see the advantages for the\ncitizen they represent of securing the more harmonious social world of\njustice as fairness.\n",
