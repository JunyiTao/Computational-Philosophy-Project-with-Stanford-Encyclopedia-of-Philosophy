    "main_text": "Varieties of Content\n3. Varieties of Content\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve reviewed two broad ways of developing the idea\nthat experiences have accuracy conditions: on the first way, these\nderive from the contents of beliefs; on the second way, they\ndon\u2019t. On either of these two approaches, the question arises of\nwhat kinds of content experiential contents are.\n\nWhichever of the two approaches are taken, a basic constraint on the\ncontents of an experience is that these should reflect (at least some)\nintuitions about when experiences are accurate or inaccurate. Another\ncommonly-held constraint is that the contents must be adequate to its\nphenomenology: any proposal for what contents a given experience has\nmust in some way reflect the phenomenology of the experience. The\nnotion of phenomenal adequacy has considerable intuitive force.\nTheories of the contents of experience are often defended on the\ngrounds that they \u201cdo justice to the phenomenology\u201d (for\nexample, see the discussion in\n Section 6.2\n of the \u2018richness\u2019 motivation for non-conceptual content,\nthe discussion in\n Section 3.4\n of indexical content, and Chalmers (2006)) or are criticized on the\ngrounds that they \u201cget the phenomenology wrong\u201d (e.g.,\nSmith 2003, 259ff; Dainton 2000, 115; Johnston 2004, 120). These\nappeals presuppose that the contents of experience have to in some way\nreflect the phenomenology of the experience. \n\nThis section reviews the main theories of what kinds of contents\nexperience contents are.\n",
