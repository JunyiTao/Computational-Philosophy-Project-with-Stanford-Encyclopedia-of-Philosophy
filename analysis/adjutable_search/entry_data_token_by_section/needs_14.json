    "main_text": "Distribution According to Need || Weighted Priority Principle\n5.4 Weighted Priority Principle\n\n\nIt follows that to assess what someone is due under a needs-based\nprinciple of distribution, we will have to take into account at least\nthe following three factors: how large their claim is in absolute\nterms; how large their claim is compared with the claims of others in\nthe relevant group; and how capable they are of converting resources\ninto diminished levels of need. This raises the question whether there\nis any single principle of distribution that is sensitive to each of\nthese factors. One principle that might appear to be is the weighted\npriority principle defended, for example, in Crisp 2002.  Whereas a\nstrict priority principle tells us always to begin by attending to\nthose with the largest need claims\u2014and therefore fall foul of\nthe problem noted above, of paying no attention to relative capacity\nto benefit, so that it may instruct us to focus exclusively on\nbringing about small improvements in the condition of the most\nneedy\u2014a weighted priority principle works differently. It\ncalculates gains by multiplying reductions in needs score by a factor\nthat reflects the absolute starting position of the person in\nquestion. So if we return to the simple case where one person needs\n1000 kcals and another 500 kcals, and use an arithmetic weighting\nfactor, then we would count reducing the first person\u2019s level of\nneed to 800 kcals as equivalent to reducing the second person\u2019s\nlevel of need to 400. The needier person\u2019s gain is treated as\ntwice as significant as the less needy person\u2019s.\n\n\nBut this principle too has implications that in some cases seem\ncounterintuitive. One is that, despite the tilt in favour of the\nneediest, there are going to be cases in which it advocates helping a\nlarge number of less needy people instead. If enough people can have\nminor headaches relieved at the cost of denying someone a kidney\ntransplant, the principle will advocate doing that. Crisp responds to\nthis problem by introducing a needs threshold such that those with\nrelatively trivial needs are excluded at the first stage of\nimplementation and only come into consideration if there are surplus\nresources after the weighted priority principle is applied to those\nabove the threshold. But, as he himself puts it, \u2018where the\nthreshold falls, of course, is the key question any proponent of this\nview must answer\u2019 (Crisp 2002, 140).\n\n\nAnother problem with the weighted priority view is that it pays no\ndirect attention to horizontal fairness between people, in the\nfollowing sense: we think that if two people begin in the same\ncondition of need\u2014say they have sustained similar\ninjuries\u2014there is value in their receiving treatment that gives\nthem the same outcome, so long as this is feasible and not excessively\ncostly. But the weighted priority principle cannot ensure this, since\nit has a bias in favour of the victim who can be treated at lesser\ncost; by choosing to treat that person rather than the equally needy\nother, more needs overall can be satisfied. So although there might be\nexceptional cases in which we are willing to practice a form of\ntriage, because we can see that treating John\u2019s needs will have\nopportunity costs that are simply too high, the weighted priority\nprinciple risks taking us too far in that direction.\n",
