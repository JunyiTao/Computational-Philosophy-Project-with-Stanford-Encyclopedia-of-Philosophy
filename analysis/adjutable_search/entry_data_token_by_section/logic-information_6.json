    "main_text": "Information as Correlation: Situation Theory || Information flow and constraints\n2.2 Information flow and constraints\n\nThe following are typical statements about \u201cinformation\nflow\u201d as studied in situation theory:\n\n[E1] \nThe fact that the dot in the radar screen is moving upward indicates\nthat flight A123 is moving northward. \n[E2] \nThe presence of footprints of pattern \\(P\\) in Zhucheng indicates that\na dinosaur lived in the region millions of years ago. \n\n\nThe general scheme has the form\n\n[IC] \nThat \\(s : T\\) indicates that \\(p\\). \n\n\nwhere \\(s : T\\) is notation for \u201c\\(s\\) is of type \\(T\\)\u201d.\nThe idea is that it is concrete parts of the world that act as\ncarriers of information (the concrete dot in the radar or the\nfootprints in Zhucheng), and that they do so by virtue of being of a\ncertain type (the dot moving upward or the footprints showing a\ncertain pattern). What each of these concrete instances indicates is a\nfact about another correlated part of the world. For the issues to be\ndiscussed below it will suffice to consider cases where the indicated\nfact\u2014 \\(p\\) in the formulation of [IC]\u2014is\nof the form \\(s' : T '\\), as in the radar example.\n\nThe conditions needed to verify informational signalling in the sense\nof [\\(\\mathbf{IC}\\)] rely on the existence of law-like\nconstraints such as natural laws, necessary laws such as\nthose of math, or conventions, thanks to which (in part) one situation\nmay serve as carrier of information about another one. Constraints\nspecify the correlations that exist between situations of\nvarious types, in the following sense: if two types \\(T\\) and \\(T '\\)\nare subject to the constraint \\(T \\Rightarrow T '\\), then for every\nsituation \\(s\\) of type \\(T\\) there is a relevantly connected\nsituation \\(s'\\) of type \\(T '\\). In the radar example, the relevant\ncorrelation would be captured by the constraint GoingUpward\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) GoingNorth,\nwhich says that each situation where a\nradar point moves upward is connected with another situation where a\nplane is moving to the north. It is the existence of this constraint\nthat allows a particular situation where the dot moves to indicate\nsomething about the connected plane situation.\n\nWith this background, the verification principle for information\nsignalling in situation theory can be formulated as follows:\n\n[IS Verification] \\(s : T\\) indicates that \\(s' :\nT'\\) if \\(T \\Rightarrow T '\\) and \\(s\\) is relevantly\nconnected to \\(s'\\).\n\nThe relation \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is transitive. This ensures that\nDretske\u2019s Xerox principle holds in this account of information\ntransfer, that is, there can be no loss of semantic information\nthrough information transfer chains.\n\n[Xerox Principle]: If \\(s_1 : T_1\\) indicates that\n\\(s_2 : T_2\\) and \\(s_2 : T_2\\) indicates that \\(s_3 : T_3\\), then\n\\(s_1 : T_1\\) indicates that \\(s_3 : T_3\\).\n\nThe [IS Verification] principle deals with\ninformation that in principle could be acquired by an agent.\nThe access to some of this information will be blocked, for example,\nif the agent is oblivious to the correlation that exists between two\nkinds of situations. In addition, most correlations are not absolute,\nthey admit exceptions. Thus, for the signalling described in\n[E1] to be really informational, the extra\ncondition that the radar system is working properly must be\nmet. Conditional versions of the [IS Verification]\nprinciple may be used to insist that the carrier situation must meet\ncertain background conditions. The inability of an agent to keep track\nof changes on these background conditions may lead to errors. So, if\nthe radar is broken, the dot on the screen may end up moving upward\nwhile the plane is moving south. Unless the air controller is able to\nrecognise the problem, that is, unless she realises that the\nbackground conditions have changed, she may end up giving absurd\ninstructions to the pilot. Now, instructions are tied to actions. For\na treatment of actions from the situation-theoretical view, we refer\nthe reader to Israel and Perry (1991).\n",
