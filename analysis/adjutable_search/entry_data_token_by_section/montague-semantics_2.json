    "main_text": "Components of Montague Semantics || Unicorns and Meaning Postulates\n2.1 Unicorns and Meaning Postulates\n\nMontague\u2019s most influential article was \u2018The Proper\nTreatment of Quantification in Ordinary English\u2019 (Montague\n1973), commonly abbreviated as \u2018PTQ\u2019. It presented a\nfragment of English that covered several phenomena which were in those\ndays discussed extensively. One of the examples gave rise to the\ntrademark of Montague grammar: the unicorn (several publications on\nMontague grammar are illustrated with unicorns).\n\nConsider the two sentences John finds a unicorn and John\nseeks a unicorn. These are syntactically alike\n(subject-verb-object), but are semantically very different. From the\nfirst sentence follows that there exists at least one unicorn, whereas\nthe second sentence is ambiguous between the so called de\ndicto (or non-specific, or notional) reading\nwhich does not imply the existence of unicorns, and the de re\n(or specific, or objectual) reading from which\nexistence of unicorns follows.\n\nThe two sentences are examples of a traditional problem called\n\u2018quantification into intensional contexts\u2019. Traditionally,\nthe second sentence as a whole was seen as an intensional context, and\nthe novelty of Montague\u2019s solution was that he considered the\nobject position of seek as the source of the phenomenon. He\nformalized seek not as a relation between two individuals,\nbut as a relation between an individual and a more abstract entity\n(see section 2.2). Under this analysis the existence of a unicorn does\nnot follow. The de re reading is obtained in a different way\n(see section 2.5).\n\nIt was Montague\u2019s strategy to apply to all expressions of a\ncategory the most general approach, and narrow this down, when\nrequired, by meaning postulates (and, in some cases, logical\ndecomposition). So initially, find is also considered to be a\nrelation between an individual and such an abstract entity, but some\nmeaning postulate restricts the class of models in which we interpret\nthe fragment to only those models in which the relation for\nfind is the (classical) relation between individuals.\n\nAs a consequence of this strategy, Montague\u2019s paper has many\nmeaning postulates. Nowadays semanticists often prefer to express the\nsemantic properties of individual lexical items directly in their\nlexical meaning, and then find is directly interpreted as a\nrelation between individuals. Meaning postulates are mainly used to\nexpress structural properties of the models (for instance, the\nstructure of the time axis), and to express relations between the\nmeanings of words. For a discussion of the role of meaning postulates,\nsee Zimmermann 1999.\n",
