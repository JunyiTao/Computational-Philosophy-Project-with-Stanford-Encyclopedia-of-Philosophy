    "main_text": "Objections || Idealization\n7.1 Idealization\n\nAs we have seen above, all conceptions of public reason involve a\ncertain amount of idealization. The persons to whom rules must be\njustified are not persons as they actually are, with all their\nprejudices, biases, and irrational beliefs. Instead, the constituency\nof public reason is typically idealized on both moral and epistemic\ndimensions. Critics of public reason sometimes object to this\nidealization (Enoch 2013; Enoch 2015; Raz 1990). The objection is best\npresented in the form of a dilemma. On the one hand, if the degree of\nidealization is kept to a minimum, then public reason may result in\nanarchy, or may fail to deliver minimally acceptable results; for\nexample, rules prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race or sex\nmay not be justifiable to only modestly idealized parties. On the\nother hand, if the degree of idealization is very substantial, this\ncreates two different worries. First, it\u2019s no longer clear in\nwhat sense the resulting rules are justifiable to the real persons\nbound by the rules. The whole apparatus of public justification might\nseem superfluous (Van Schoelandt 2015); it would be simpler and more\naccurate to simply present certain principles or reasons as true, and\ndeclare that anyone who refuses to acknowledge their truth is making\nan error. Second, and relatedly, too much idealization may implausibly\nentail that almost all real persons are excluded from the constituency\nof public reason (Enoch 2015, 122\u201323). The dilemma is nicely\nsummarized by Raz:\n\nIt seems tempting to say that our duty to act only on political\nprinciples to which the reasonable consent is simply the duty to act\non well-founded, valid principles. For that is what the reasonable\nconsent to. This eliminates the independent role of consent . . . The\npuzzle is how one can give consent a viable role, without saying that\nonly principles already agreed to by all can be relied on. One must\nfind a reasonable interpretation of the intuitively appealing idea\nthat political principles must be accessible to people as they are . .\n. Politics must take people as they come and be accessible to them,\ncapable of commanding their consent without expecting them to change\nin any radical way. But at the same time, justified political\nprinciples may be controversial, and may fail to command actual\nconsent. Nagel and Rawls offer interpretations of this intuition which\naim to be both coherent and attractive. Their failure suggests that\nthe underlying idea may at bottom be unstable and incoherent. There\nmay be no middle way between actual (including implied) agreement and\nrational justification. (Raz 1990, 46).\n\n\nIn response, several strategies are available to the proponent of\npublic reason. First, the proponent might aim for a Goldilocks\nsolutions; locate a degree of idealization that is substantial enough\nto avoid the first horn of the dilemma, without being so substantial\nas to generate the problems associated with the second horn (Vallier\n2014, 145\u2013180). Second, proponents of public reason might\nembrace either horn of the dilemma. On the one hand, they might argue\nthat accounts of public reason cannot be judged by independent moral\nstandards. We have to follow the process of public justification\nwherever it goes, even if this entails only a minimal set of rules are\npublicly justifiable. On the other hand, proponents of public reason\nmight embrace the consequences of a great deal of idealization. In\nparticular, if we bear in mind that the category of the\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d (those excluded from the constituency of\npublic reason) is a technical term with no necessary implications\nregarding moral and political rights, there may be nothing so\ncounterintuitive about declaring many persons to be unreasonable.\nFinally, proponents of public reason might resist the assumption, on\nwhich the dilemma appears to rest, that one of public reason\u2019s\ncentral aims is to mimic the normative role that actual consent can\nplay in legitimating authority. If public reason is not intended to be\nsome pale form of consent, then it\u2019s no longer an objection to\npoint out that substantial idealization might yield conclusions that\ndepart dramatically from what many real persons would accept.\n",
