    "main_text": "Liberalism and Empire\n3. Liberalism and Empire\n\nThe legitimacy of colonialism was also a topic of debate among French,\nGerman, and British philosophers in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant, Smith and Diderot were\ncritical of the barbarity of colonialism and challenged the idea that\nEuropeans had the obligation to \u201ccivilize\u201d the rest of the\nworld. The colonial system of slavery, land theft, and feudal labor\nwas antithetical to the principles of freedom and self-government. The\nrise of anti-colonial political theory, however, required more than a\nuniversalistic ethic that recognized the shared humanity of all\npeople. Given the powerful economic interests in the control of\nIndigenous land and the exploitation of Indigenous labor, universalism\nproved to be a relatively weak basis for criticizing colonialism.\n\nOne of the key issues that distinguished critics from proponents of\ncolonialism and imperialism was their view of the relationship between\nculture, history and progress. Many of the influential philosophers\nwriting in France and England in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies had assimilated some version of the developmental approach\nto history that was associated with the Scottish Enlightenment.\nAccording to the stadial theory of historical development, all\nsocieties naturally moved from hunting, to herding, to farming, to\ncommerce, a developmental process that simultaneously tracked a\ncultural arc from \u201csavagery,\u201d through\n\u201cbarbarism,\u201d to \u201ccivilization.\u201d\n\u201cCivilization\u201d was not just a marker of material\nimprovement, but also a normative judgment about the moral progress of\nsociety. (Kohn and O\u2019Neill 2006)\n\nThe language of civilization, savagery, and barbarism is pervasive in\nwriters as diverse of Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and John Stuart Mill.\nIt would therefore be incorrect to conclude that a developmental\ntheory of history is distinctive of the liberal tradition;\nnevertheless, given that figures of the Scottish Enlightenment such as\nFerguson and Smith were among its leading expositors, it is strongly\nassociated with liberalism. Smith himself opposed imperialism for\neconomic reasons. He felt that relations of dependence between\nmetropole and periphery distorted self-regulating market mechanisms\nand worried that the cost of military domination would be burdensome\nfor taxpayers (Pitts 2005). The idea that civilization is the\nculmination of a process of historical development, however, proved\nuseful in justifying imperialism. According to Uday Mehta, liberal\nimperialism was the product of the interaction between universalism\nand developmental history (1999). A core doctrine of liberalism holds\nthat all individuals share a capacity for reason and self-government.\nThe theory of developmental history, however, modifies this\nuniversalism with the notion that these capacities only emerge at a\ncertain stage of civilization (McCarthy 2009). For example, according\nto John Stuart Mill (hereafter Mill), savages do not have the capacity\nfor self-government because of their excessive love of freedom. Serfs,\nslaves, and peasants in barbarous societies, on the other hand, may be\nso schooled in obedience that their capacity for rationality is\nstifled. Only commercial society produces the material and cultural\nconditions that enable individuals to realize their potential for\nfreedom and self-government. According to this logic, civilized\nsocieties like Great Britain are acting in the interest of\nless-developed peoples by governing them. Imperialism, from this\nperspective, is not primarily a form of political domination and\neconomic exploitation but rather a paternalistic practice of\ngovernment that exports \u201ccivilization\u201d (e.g.\nmodernization) in order to foster the improvement of native peoples.\nDespotic government (and Mill doesn\u2019t hesitate to use this term)\nis a means to the end of improvement and ultimately\nself-government.\n\nMill, a life-long employee of the British East India Company,\nrecognized that despotic government by a foreign people could lead to\ninjustice and economic exploitation. These abuses, if unchecked, could\nundermine the legitimacy and efficacy of the imperial project. In\nConsiderations on Representative Government (1861), Mill\nidentifies four reasons why foreign (e.g. European) peoples are not\nsuited to governing colonies. First, foreign politicians are unlikely\nto have the knowledge of local conditions that is necessary to solve\nproblems of public policy effectively. Second, given cultural,\nlinguistic, and often religious differences between colonizers and\ncolonized, the colonizers are unlikely to sympathize with the native\npeoples and are likely to act tyrannically. Third, even if the\ncolonizers really try to treat the native peoples fairly, their\nnatural tendency to sympathize with those similar to themselves (other\nforeign colonists or merchants) would likely lead to distorted\njudgment in cases of conflict. Finally, according to Mill, colonists\nand merchants go abroad in order to acquire wealth with little effort\nor risk, which means that their economic activity often exploits the\ncolonized country rather than developing it. These arguments echo\npoints made in Edmund Burke\u2019s voluminous writings assailing the\nmisgovernment in India, most notably Burke\u2019s famous Speech on\nFox\u2019s East India Bill (1783). Recent scholarship, however, has\nchallenged the view of Burke as an opponent of imperialism. Daniel\nO\u2019Neill has argued that Burke was a staunch supporter of the\nBritish Empire in the eighteenth century (2016). According to\nO\u2019Neill, Burke\u2019s defense of empire was ideologically\nconsistent with his conservative opposition to the French\nRevolution.\n\nMill\u2019s solution to the problem of imperial misgovernment was to\neschew parliamentary oversight in favor of a specialized\nadministrative corps. Members of this specialized body would have the\ntraining to acquire relevant knowledge of local conditions. Paid by\nthe government, they would not personally benefit from economic\nexploitation and could fairly arbitrate conflicts between colonists\nand indigenous people. Mill, however, was not able to explain how to\nensure good government where those wielding political power were not\naccountable to the population. In this sense, Mill\u2019s writing is\nemblematic of the failure of liberal imperial thought.\n\nNineteenth century liberal thinkers held a range of views on the\nlegitimacy of foreign domination and conquest. Alexis de Tocqueville,\nfor example, made a case for colonialism that did not rely on the idea\nof a \u201ccivilizing mission.\u201d Tocqueville recognized that\ncolonialism probably did not bring good government to the native\npeoples, but this did not lead him to oppose colonialism since his\nsupport rested entirely on the way it benefited France. Tocqueville\ninsisted that French colonies in Algeria would increase France\u2019s\nstature vis-\u00e0-vis rivals like England. Colonies would provide\nan outlet for excess population that caused disorder in France.\nTocqueville also suggested that imperial endeavors would incite a\nfeeling of patriotism that would counterbalance the modern centrifugal\nforces of materialism and class conflict.\n\nTocqueville was actively engaged in advancing the project of French\ncolonization of Algeria. Tocqueville\u2019s first analysis of French\ncolonialism was published during his 1837 electoral campaign for a\nseat in the Chamber of Deputies. As a member of the Chamber of\nDeputies, Tocqueville argued in favor of expanding the French presence\nin Algeria. He traveled to Algeria in 1841 composing an \u201cEssay\non Algeria\u201d that served as the basis for two parliamentary\nreports on the topic (Tocqueville 1841). Unlike the more na\u00efve\nproponents of the \u201ccivilizing mission,\u201d Tocqueville\nadmitted that the brutal military occupation did little to introduce\ngood government or advance civilization. In an apparent reversal of\nthe four-stages theory of the Scottish Enlightenment, he acknowledged\nthat \u201cwe are now fighting far more barbarously than the Arabs\nthemselves\u201d and \u201cit is on their side that one meets with\ncivilization.\u201d (Tocqueville 1841: 70) This realization, however,\ndid not imply a critique of French brutality. Instead, Tocqueville\ndefended controversial tactics such as the destruction of crops,\nconfiscation of land, and seizure of unarmed civilians. His texts,\nhowever, provide little in the way of philosophical justification and\nhe dismisses the entire just war tradition by stating, \u201cI\nbelieve that the right of war authorizes us to ravage the\ncountry.\u201d (Tocqueville 1841: 70). In Tocqueville\u2019s\nwritings on Algeria, the French national interest is paramount and\nmoral considerations are explicitly subordinate to political\ngoals.\n\nTocqueville\u2019s analysis of Algeria reflects little anxiety about\nits legitimacy and much concern about the pragmatics of effective\ncolonial governance. The stability of the regime, he felt, depended on\nthe ability of the colonial administration to provide good government\nto the French settlers. Tocqueville emphasized that the excessive\ncentralization of decision-making in Paris combined with the arbitrary\npractices of the local military leadership meant that French colonists\nhad no security of property, let alone the political and civil rights\nthat they were accustomed to France. Tocqueville was untroubled by the\nuse of martial law against indigenous peoples, but felt that it was\ncounterproductive when applied to the French. For Tocqueville, the\nsuccess of the French endeavor in Algeria depended entirely on\nattracting large numbers of permanent French settlers. Given that it\nwas proving impossible to win the allegiance of the indigenous people,\nFrance could not hold Algeria without creating a stable community of\ncolonists. The natives were to be ruled through military domination\nand the French were to be enticed to settle through the promise of\neconomic gain in an environment that reproduced, as much as possible,\nthe cultural and political life of France. After a brief period of\noptimism about \u201camalgamation\u201d of the races in his\n\u201cSecond Letter on Algeria\u201d (Tocqueville 1837: 25),\nTocqueville understood the colonial world in terms of the permanent\nopposition of settler and native, an opposition structured to ensure\nthe economic benefit of the former.\n",
