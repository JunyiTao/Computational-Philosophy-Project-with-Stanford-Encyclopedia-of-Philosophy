Biography\n\nBorn in Le Havre on November 15, 1607, Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry was\nborn into a minor Norman aristocratic family, often dismissed as\nbourgeois by her critics. Her later efforts to conquer the\naristocratic and court society of Paris often appeared tied to\ninsecurity concerning her familial rank. Orphaned at the age of six,\nScud\u00e9ry entered into the care of her uncle, an ecclesiastic who\nprovided her with an extensive education. She studied reading,\nwriting, drawing, painting, music, and dancing. She received\ninstruction in the practical arts of medicine, agriculture, and\ndomestic economy. Her most notable achievement was mastery of Spanish\nand Italian; the domestic library featured numerous volumes written in\neach language. A voracious reader, she discovered the epic serial\nnovels which would become her preferred literary genre as an author.\nScud\u00e9ry also began her philosophical initiation with the\nreading of Montaigne, who would influence her later sympathy with\nskepticism, and Plutarch (in the French translation by Jacques Amyot),\nwho introduced her to the Stoic philosophy of reason, will, and\nvirtue.\n\nIn 1637 Scud\u00e9ry joined her brother Georges at his residence in\nParis. A burgeoning playwright, Georges introduced his sister to the\nliterary salons of Paris. Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry quickly\nbecame a frequent guest at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, where\nCatherine de Vivonne presided over her salon, the celebrated\nchambre bleue [blue room]. Notable salon authors included\nPierre\n Corneille,[1]\n Jean-Louis Guez de\n Balzac,[2]\n Valentin\n Conrart,[3]\n Jean\n Chapelain,[4]\n Gilles\n M\u00e9nage,[5]\n Mademoiselle de\n Montpensier,[6]\n Madame de\n S\u00e9vign\u00e9,[7]\n Madame de\n Lafayette,[8]\n and Catherine\n Descartes.[9]\n Although eclectic in their philosophy, several authors evinced a\nclear sympathy for moral libertinism. In later writings, the salon\nlibertine would often serve as the object of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\ncensure.\n\nDuring the Rambouillet years, Scud\u00e9ry launched her own literary\ncareer. Printed under the name of her brother Georges, she published\nan historical novel, Ibrahim or the Ilustrious Basa, in 1641\nand Illustrious Women or Heroic Harangues in 1642. With the\npublication of Artam\u00e8ne or the Great Cyrus, a novel\nprinted in ten volumes from 1648 until 1653, Mademoiselle de\nScud\u00e9ry acquired literary fame. One of the world\u2019s\nlongest novels, containing more than two million words, the work\nattracted a broad European reading public still avid for serial\nhistorical romances. Although it is set in ancient Assyria, the work\nwas clearly a roman-\u00e0-clef which depicted various\nmembers of Rambouillet\u2019s literary circle through pseudonyms.\nScud\u00e9ry herself appears under the title of Sappho. Now an\nacclaimed author, Scud\u00e9ry participated enthusiastically in the\ncapital\u2019s literary quarrels. In 1651 she was involved in a\ndispute over the relative merits of Isaac de Benserade\u2019s sonnet\nJob and Vincent Voiture\u2019s sonnet\n Urania.[10]\n In political disputes, Scud\u00e9ry remained faithful to the French\ncrown. During the Fronde (1648\u201353), the intermittent\ncivil war opposing old aristocratic families and the Parisian\nparliament to the monarchy, Scud\u00e9ry sided with the throne,\ndespite her personal admiration for the women who had led the military\nresistance to the Bourbons in certain areas of the country. Her\nroyalist sympathies would later harden into an admiration of Louis XIV\nthat bordered on sycophancy.\n\nIn 1653 Madeleine and Georges Scud\u00e9ry established a new\nresidence in the Marais neighborhood of Paris. It is here that\nMademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry conducted her famous Saturday salon:\nthe samedis, where a large literary circle assembled to\ndiscuss disputed questions, especially those concerning the nature of\nlove. The writings of Montaigne, Pierre Charron, and Marguerite de\nNavarre were discussed in the debates on the nature of true\n friendship.[11]\n Prominent participants in the salon included Madame de\n Sabl\u00e9,[12]\n Madame de Lafayette, Madame Scarron (the future Madame de\n Maintenon),[13]\n Valentin Conrart, Paul\n Pellisson,[14]\n Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\n Sarasin,[15]\n Gilles M\u00e9nage, Jean Chapelain, and Antoine Gombaud, chevalier\nde\n M\u00e9r\u00e9.[16]\n Many of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophical dialogues reflect\nM\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s ideal of honn\u00eatet\u00e9,\nthe virtue of decency, fairness, and tolerance, especially in the\nrealm of disputed ideas. Salonni\u00e8res debated the\n\u201cnew philosophy\u201d of Descartes; Scud\u00e9ry opposed the\nmechanistic theory of matter in Cartesianism. \n\nScud\u00e9ry continued to work as a prolific author. The ten-volume\nCl\u00e9lie or a Roman History (1654\u201361) contained\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s most celebrated passage, the Carte de\nTendre, a map of love, which describes the various obstacles\n(depicted as rivers, deserts, and mountains) affection must overcome\nas it attempts to reach the summit of spiritual love. Sensing the\npublic\u2019s disaffection for the older serial novels,\nScud\u00e9ry published several novellas: C\u00e9linte\n(1661), Mathilde d\u2019Aguilar (1667), and Promenade at\nVersailles (1669). Later in life, Scud\u00e9ry published her\nmost philosophical works. Labeled as \u201cconversations,\u201d\nthese works were a series of dialogues presenting the philosophical\nand literary issues commonly debated in the salons; the anthologies\ncontained dialogues extracted from the earlier novels, reworked\ndialogues, and dialogues created expressly for the new collections.\nThe works included Conversations on Different Subjects\n(1680), New Conversations on Different Subjects (1684),\nMoral Conversations (1686), New Moral Conversations\n(1688), and Moral Dialogues (1692).\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s prolific authorship and influential salon\nbrought her numerous honors. The Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\nawarded her its first literary prize for her essay On Glory\nin\n 1671.[17]\n The Academy of the Ricovrati in Padua elected her to membership in\n1684. But opponents strongly contested the literary and intellectual\nworth of Scud\u00e9ry. Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Les\nPr\u00e9cieuses ridicules (1659), Fureti\u00e8re\u2019s\nLe Roman bourgeois (1666), and Boileau\u2019s Satire\nX (1667) mocked Scud\u00e9ry as the model\n pr\u00e9cieuse.[18]\n According to this caricature, Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s erudition was\npedantry, her profligacy redundancy, her philosophical theories\nsecond-hand and incoherent. This dismissal of Scud\u00e9ry as a\nrisible arriviste would long dominate her image among\nliterary critics and close her books to generations of potential\nreaders.\n\nMademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry died on June 2, 1701. She was interred\nin the Parisian church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs.\n2. Works\n\nThe works of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry fall into several distinct\ngenres: the novel, the novella, the dialogue, the oration, and the\nletter.\n\nThe novels follow the conventions of the serial epic novel established\nearlier in the seventeenth century. Each features an exotic locale.\nIbrahim or the Illustrious Basa (1641) sprawls over the\nancient Mediterranean basin. Artam\u00e8ne or the Grand\nCyrus (1649\u20131653) takes place in ancient Assyria.\nCl\u00e9lie, a Roman History (1654) is set in classical\nRome. Each is of extraordinary length to present its intricate twists\nin plot. Ibrahim has four volumes, Cyrus ten,\nCl\u00e9lie ten. The novels feature numerous abductions of\nthe heroine, a trait which was the cause of mockery by early and later\ncritics. Philosophically, the novels provide a critical portrait of\nthe abuses of power in the relationship between the sexes, especially\nin the practices of rape and forced marriage, and in the relationship\nbetween ruler and ruled, notably in the practice of enslavement.\n\nThe novellas represent a concession to the changed tastes of the\nFrench literary public. New miniature genres (the maxim, the tale, the\nfable) had replaced the outmoded genre of the prolix romance novel.\nC\u00e9linte (1661) and Mathilde d\u2019Aguilar\n(1667) explore the distinctive traits of female psychology, especially\nin the area of the passions and the propensity toward curiosity.\nPromenade at Versailles (1669) exemplifies\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s royalist political philosophy at its most\nmilitant; Louis XIV is praised as the model of virtues and Versailles\nis depicted as a terrestrial paradise.\n\nThe dialogues published toward the end of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s life\nrepresent the most philosophical of her works. Labeled as\n\u201cconversations,\u201d the dialogues reflect the debates and\nfavored topics of the salon Scud\u00e9ry hosted at the celebrated\nsamedis. A series of characters informally discuss a disputed\nissue of the moment; the conversation usually leads to a consensus on\nthe correctness of a particular position but occasionally the debate\nends in intellectual deadlock. Many dialogues focus on philosophical\nissues: the nature of the virtues, the nature of the passions, the\nproblem of free will, arguments for God\u2019s existence. Numerous\nconversations treat literary issues: the comparative merit of French\npoets, the proper method of letter-writing, the nature of artistic\nmimesis. Several dialogues deal with scientific questions. On\nButterflies and History of Two Chameleons defend a\nvitalist theory of animal life and contest the mechanistic theory of\nthe animal-machine.\n\nOne of the more unusual genres invented by Scud\u00e9ry is the\nrhetorical oration used in Illustrious Women or Heroic\nHarangues (1642). In this series of discourses by famous women,\nScud\u00e9ry creates fictitious diatribes pronounced by powerful\nwomen in a moment of crisis, often on the verge of death. Prominent\ncharacters include Cleopatra and Sappho. Many of the harangues\ncriticize the reduction of women to silence by political oppression\nand the need for women to express themselves forcefully through spoken\nand written speech. Placed in the mouths of socially prominent women,\nthe orations also defend the right of women to exercise political\nauthority.\n\nThe letters of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry involve two distinct\ntypes. The first are fictitious: Amorous Letters from Various\nContemporary Authors (1641). Imitating Ovid, this collection\nprovides model-letters for the expression of love by interested\nparties, including women expressing affection for each other. The\nactual correspondence of Scud\u00e9ry is currently dispersed among\nvarious anthologies and archives. A prolix epistler, Scud\u00e9ry\ncorresponded with the intellectual elite of French society. Bossuet\nand F\u00e9nelon figure among her\n correspondents.[19]\n Of special philosophical interest is Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\ncorrespondence with Catherine Descartes, the niece of Ren\u00e9\nDescartes. Both correspondents reject the uncle\u2019s mechanistic\nexplanation of animal life. \n3. Philosophy\n\nInterpreting the philosophy of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry requires\ncertain cautions. First, a lifelong disciple of Montaigne,\nScud\u00e9ry repeatedly expresses skepticism concerning the\nenterprise of philosophy itself. The disputes of philosophical schools\noften appear to be nothing more than a Babel of discordant\nauthorities. Despite the furor, no definitive solution to\nphilosophical disputes can impose itself. The contemporary dispute\nover Descartes\u2019s theory of vortices illustrates the obscure,\nendless controversies generated by philosophical pride. \n\n\nThis argument will go on forever. The problem is so complicated. Any\nresolution of it is beyond the power of the human mind. The result\nwill always be an unstable mixture of half-truths and unanticipated\ndifficulties. This problem arises because philosophers generally try\nto say something new rather than saying something true. [EM,\n1: 211] \n\n\nDespite her periodic endorsements of skepticism, Scud\u00e9ry\nclearly maintains that some philosophical theses are true. Her\nreligious philosophy insists that God\u2019s existence can be\ndemonstrated through an argument from design; her moral philosophy\nemphatically praises certain moral qualities as virtuous and condemns\nother moral dispositions as vicious. The skeptical cast of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s rhetoric, nonetheless, indicates the\ntentativeness with which her philosophical positions are often\naffirmed.\n\nSecond, Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s dialogical form of philosophy can make\nit difficult to discern which philosophical position Scud\u00e9ry\nactually supports. In the typical \u201cconversation,\u201d multiple\nspeakers defend contrasting views on a given theoretical topic. In\nthis open-ended dialogue, each speaker\u2019s position usually\ncontains certain merits and defects; theories are corrected, altered,\nor abandoned as the exchange progresses. Certain dialogues, such as\nOf Lying, end on an inconclusive note; the disputants cannot\nagree as to whether lying is a universally evil act. In most\ndialogues, however, the speakers clearly concur on a certain\nphilosophical issue or one of the positions defended by a particular\ndisputant is clearly more convincing than the positions defended by\nothers. Unlike the philosophical essay, with its mono-authorial voice,\nthe multiple voices of the philosophical dialogue make the\ndetermination of the author\u2019s actual philosophical position a\ncomplicated enterprise. The irony employed in many Scud\u00e9ry\ndialogues renders this determination of philosophical position even\nmore delicate. \n3.1 Moral Philosophy\n\nVirtue theory constitutes the primary object of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nmoral philosophy. Many of her dialogues analyze the moral virtues and\nvices typical of the aristocratic world of the salon and the court. In\nexamining these virtues, the dialogues emphasize the distinctive ways\nin which women possess these moral qualities. The dialogues also\nstress the ambiguity of virtue. Using the distinguo [a\nrefined distinction between similar qualities], Scud\u00e9ry\nhighlights the multiple gradations of a single virtue and how certain\nmoral dispositions can function as either virtues or vices according\nto context.\n\nThe aristocratic bent of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s virtue theory appears\nin her treatment of three moral virtues: magnanimity, politeness, and\ndiscretion. Each of the virtues presupposes a certain amount of\nculture, affluence, and social rank. Magnanimity requires a rational\nestimate of one\u2019s proper worth and an acute estimation of\none\u2019s rank within the social hierarchy. \n\n\nTrue magnanimity as I consider it is a good opinion of oneself,\nfounded on reason and on the solid merit of one who aspires to great\nthings and contemns the petty. One cannot be truly magnanimous if one\ndoes not esteem oneself as much as is proper in comparison to things\nbeneath oneself. [CN, 1: 70] \n\n\nIn Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s neo-Aristotelian version of the virtue,\nmagnanimity encompasses ambition, self-esteem, and pride in social\nposition. At the same time, magnanimity must avoid contempt for the\nmysterious workings of fate or divine providence, since such\noverweening pride leads to self-destruction.\n\nThe dialogue Of Politeness conceives politeness primarily as\nthe capacity to engage in proper conversation with persons of elevated\nsocial rank. \n\n\nTrue politeness consists in knowing how to live properly and always\nknowing how to speak properly\u2026.It is the avoidance of any\nrudeness or injury to anyone. It is not saying to others what you\nwould not want them to say to you. It is wanting not to be the tyrant\nof conversation by always speaking without letting others speak.\n[CN, 1: 127] \n\n\nPoliteness entails more than proper etiquette in speech; it must be\nmotivated by a genuine charity toward the neighbor, rooted in the\ngolden rule of reciprocity.\n\nDiscretion is a virtue particularly prized at the court. Of\nDiscretion explains how this virtue is diversely expressed\naccording to one\u2019s position in the social hierarchy. \n\n\nConcerning our superiors, we do not exercise discretion; rather, we\nexpress respect. Concerning our inferiors, we do not exercise\ndiscretion; rather, we exercise goodness and indulgence, especially\nwhen we abstain from doing something pleasing to us but displeasing to\nthem. [MM, 2: 613] \n\n\nJust as gossip damages court society, the discretion of the courtier\nstrengthens it. The variations on the exercise of discretion reflect\nthe stratification of the aristocratic society for which\nScud\u00e9ry writes.\n\nIn many dialogues Scud\u00e9ry insists that women as well as men can\npossess the full range of moral virtues. Against those who hold that\nonly men can practice magnanimity because of its public and political\nnature, Scud\u00e9ry argues that women also can possess the virtue.\n\u201cThis great quality [magnanimity] is not banned from appearing\nin certain extraordinary women\u201d [CN, 1: 64]. As an\nexample, the dialogue cites Portia, wife of Brutus. Although both\nsexes can possess the most rarified moral virtues, each sex tends to\npractice the virtues in a distinctive way. The virtue of kindness is\nmore imperative in the personality of a woman than in that of a man.\n\n\n\nKindness is the most essential quality for women. It reinforces the\ncharm of their beauty and of their mind. In fact, kindness is so\nnecessary for them that they cannot be admirable without possessing it\nin an eminent degree. [CN, 1: 233]\n\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s treatment of the virtue of glory also insists\nthat women are not excluded from its practice. Of Glory\nrejects the thesis that glory is preeminently a military virtue and,\nconsequently, that it can only be acquired by men. The dialogue\ninsists that women can manifest glory by intellectual and moral\nachievement. \n\n\nLadies have glory when their mind exceeds their beauty and when they\nhave so much moral merit that one can still love them when they have\nlost everything that made them physically beautiful. [CN, 2:\n563] \n\n\nParalleling the military glory of men, women often manifest glory\nthrough the romantic wars they wage. Poetic descriptions of romance\nrightly use martial language to describe its operations. \u201cLove\nalso has its combats, victories, conquests, chains, irons, crowns,\nslaves, prisons, prisoners, defeats and triumphs\u201d [CN,\n2: 577]. In fact, glory is present in the emergence of any moral\nvirtue, whether applauded by an external public or not. \u201cGlory\nis something which necessarily arises from any act of virtue just as\nlight necessarily arises from the sun which produces it\u201d\n[CN, 2: 571\u201372]. In particular, glory accompanies the\nmoral victory over oneself through the conquest of one\u2019s\npassions.\n\nNotwithstanding the authentic moral value possessed by the natural\nvirtues of classical antiquity, Christianity has elevated the natural\nvalues through the work of grace. Modesty is exemplary. The properly\nChristian virtue of humility has refined the generic virtue of\nmodesty. \n\n\nThe word humility is a Christian term, because this virtue,\nlike all the others, has been better known since the rise of\nChristianity than it was among the pagans\u2026.In Christian\nhumility, Christians know their weaknesses and faults through the\nprecepts of divine law. Developing a genuine remorse for not having\naccomplished it, they hate themselves and only themselves. They cannot\nfeel the same way about the burden of the faults of others.\n[EM, 1: 14] \n\n\nAlthough Scud\u00e9ry evinces little interest in the properly\ntheological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, she repeatedly\nemphasizes the purifying role of grace in the transition from pagan to\ncontemporary Christian exercises of virtue.\n\nJust as the moral virtues bear an aristocratic cast in\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s works, the moral vices carry a distinctive\naristocratic stamp. The dialogues criticize vices which commonly\nappear in a court setting: flattery, dissimulation, mockery, envy, and\nvanity. In their sophistication, the vices of the courtier are\nfrequently hidden beneath the appearance of virtue. Of Hope\nanalyzes how the ambition of the courtier distorts the Christian\nvirtue of hope. \n\n\nThe entire life of the court is nothing but hope; that is where one\nalways dies in hoping for something. In every court in which\nI\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve seen courtiers puffed up with vain hopes,\nwhich at the end turned into bitter disappointments. [MM, 1: 36]\n\n\n\nThe vices criticized in the dialogues often represent a species of\nmendacity. Assaults on the order of truth, essential for the cohesion\nof society itself, constitute particularly grave moral transgressions\nin Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s hierarchy of values.\n\nIn Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s analysis, many virtues are capable of minute\nvariations in quality and operation. Of Kindness details\nnumerous subspecies of the virtue of kindness, such as habitual,\nrespectful, friendly, courtly, urbane, vivacious, eloquent, true, and\nfalse. In fact, kindness admits of so many variations that it can turn\ninto a vice in certain contexts. \n\n\nKindness, which is a peaceful and pleasant virtue, one necessary for\nsociety and rightly admired, becomes a vice if it lacks certain\nlimits. This virtue is different from others. There is only one sort\nof justice and there is only sort of generosity and of wisdom;\nhowever, there are a hundred sorts of kindnesses. [CDS, 1: 320]\n\n\n\nKindness is not alone in the moral ambiguity of certain virtues.\nOf Anger ends on a note of irresolution concerning the\nvicious nature of anger. While the dialogue\u2019s interlocutors\nagree that anger is usually a serious vice, especially when the moral\nagent deliberately prolongs it, they cannot rule out the possibility\nthat certain angers might be justified under the category of justified\nretribution.\n\nDespite the ambiguous moral status of certain virtues and vices,\nScud\u00e9ry rejects moral relativism. In several dialogues she\nargues that certain actions are patently evil, no matter how popular\nthey are in particular cultures or governments. Of Lying\nrejects the use of deception or murder to advance the interests of the\nstate. No raison d\u2019\u00e9tat can justify the use of\nimmoral means, even to justify a substantial national good. \u201cIn\norder for an action to be heroic, it is not only necessary that the\nmotive be just; it is necessary that its methods be noble and\ninnocent\u201d [CN, 1: 443]. Despite widespread social\napproval, certain customs are intrinsically immoral. Although modern\nEuropean voyagers have revealed the widespread acceptance of polygamy,\nfor example, the practice is censured by Scud\u00e9ry as oppressive.\n\n\n\nNeither nature nor reason could have authorized this custom. It is\nonly the tyranny of custom authorized by a grave voluptuousness that\nhas authorized this multiplicity of wives and the imprisonment of the\nSultan\u2019s consorts in the Seraglio. [MM, 1: 271] \n\n\nThe moral ambiguity of certain virtues should not lead to the\nacceptance of immoral practices which are only abuses of power\nsanctified by custom. Irrational customs which oppress women, such as\npolygamy and foot-binding in China, merit Scud\u00e9y\u2019s\nparticular scorn. \n3.2 Moral Psychology\n\nIn several dialogues Scud\u00e9ry examines the psychology animating\nthe moral life. This psychology consists primarily of the interplay\nbetween personal temperament, largely determined by biological\nfactors, and the personal exercise of free will. In this theory,\ntemperament shapes the moral tone of a particular personality but\nmoral character rests largely on how a moral agent exercises his or\nher personal freedom.\n\nThe variations in human personality derive largely from the different\ntemperaments human beings possess. Contrasting temperaments conceive\npain and pleasure in divergent ways; judgments concerning the worth of\na particular action or object naturally vary. \n\n\nThe diversity of temperaments causes the variations in pleasure. The\npleasures are different according to such factors as one\u2019s age\nand one\u2019s personal qualities. Ordinarily the only thing which\ndetermines this divergence are the different passions which govern the\nvarious pursuits of pleasure. [CDS, 1: 79] \n\n\nPredominantly determined by biological factors, temperament colors a\nmoral agent\u2019s distinctive perspective and inclinations toward\naction. Even the wise use of reason to discipline one\u2019s action\ncannot alter the basic temperament with which the moral agent must\nconfront ethical dilemmas.\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s account of temperament rests squarely on the\nclassical-medieval theory of the humors. Despite idiosyncratic\nvariations, human personality expresses four basic humors: choleric,\nmelancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic. \n\n\nThe humors often carry the mind away and seduce it according to their\ncaprices. This is what accounts for the great diversity of sentiments\namong the most reasonable people. Without the humors, all reasonable\npeople would like equally everything meriting to be liked, whether in\nthe sciences, in the arts, or in simple pleasures. In fact, different\ntemperaments, which reflect different humors, tend to prefer different\nobjects, despite the weight of reason. This is what explains this\nvariety of emotional inclinations of which society is full.\n[CN, 2: 458] \n\n\nThis differential in humor explains how equally rational human agents\ncan have very different experiences of and judgments concerning the\nsame external object or activity. It also explains the unusual power\nof moods, such as ennui, on the moral perception and decisions of the\nhuman person.\n\nTemperament is particularly powerful in influencing the moral agent\nwhen it fabricates strong desires. Unlike ideas or even simple wishes,\ndesires rarely submit to the discipline of reason. \n\n\nWishes must be the work of reason, but desires are nearly always blind\npowers which are born from temperament. Several times in my life\nI\u2019ve had desires for several things I never wished for, because\nreason was opposed to them. [MM, 1: 344] \n\n\nThe arational empire of desire can easily motivate violent action in\nthe interest of neither the moral agent nor his or her neighbor. \n\nDespite the power of temperament, the moral agent can correct it\nthrough the use of free will. It is precisely in the emergence of free\nwill\u2019s combat against the inclinations of temperament that\npersonal moral responsibility arises. Of Inclination\ndescribes the emergence of the moral responsibility which rightly\nmerits the moral agent praise or blame for actions. \n\n\nWe are born with the inclinations which heaven was pleased to give us,\nbut we enter into the possession of praise or blame only at the moment\nwe begin to act through reason. Up to this point, nothing is truly up\nto us; after that point, we are responsible for everything we do,\nwhether good or evil. Therefore, it is up to us to see what\ninclinations we should follow and those we should change. Having known\nthe true path of glory and virtue, we should walk in it despite all\nthe repugnance we might find within ourselves. [CN, 1: 319]\n\n\n\nIn the transformation of temperament to suit the demands of the moral\norder, reason must often contradict the pull of emotions surrounding a\ndistorted humor.\n\nTo illustrate the mastery of temperament by reason, Of Anger\ndepicts the obligatory transformation of excessive anger by the agent\nwho possesses such a temperament. \n\n\nExcessive anger is the ordinary fault of all weak people. As\nrepentance is the greatest manifestation of human reason, it is\nnecessary from the earliest moments to habituate oneself to overcome a\npassion which is practically always followed and which makes the\nbearer of it hated and despised. [MM, 1: 359] \n\n\nRather than abolishing the passions, a morally mature reason\ntransforms them. In the case of a choleric temperament, the flames of\nanger are transformed into the sentiments of restraint, remorse, and\nrepentance for the damage inflected by excessive anger.\n3.3 Epistemology\n\nInfluenced by Montaigne, Scud\u00e9ry often expresses skepticism\nconcerning claims to knowledge. Social custom in particular often\ntempts the noetic agent to mistake prejudice for authentic knowledge.\nThe complex psychology by which human beings experience the world\noften tinges their claims to knowledge with subjectivity.\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s skepticism, however, is a mitigated one.\nEspecially in the religious domain, the noetic agent can acquire\ncertain knowledge and overcome the limits to knowledge tied to the\nfallible senses and social bias.\n\nMany claims to knowledge are so doubtful that one can easily endorse\nskepticism as the proper position concerning knowledge itself. The\nexperience of error and subsequent correction reveals how thin are the\nfoundations of all noetic claims. \n\n\nI think sometimes that everything is so doubtful that one can only\nsupport one position concerning knowledge. If I had to establish one\nsect in this area, I would like to start one where it would be\npermitted to doubt everything. The one exception would be the things\nof religion. [CN, 1: 167] \n\n\nThe exception to the rule of skepticism concerns religious truths. In\nnumerous writings Scud\u00e9ry argues that certain religious\nknowledge involves both philosophical demonstrations of God\u2019s\nexistence and the theological and moral truths unveiled by God in\nsacred revelation.\n\nOf Incertitude explores the psychological sources of this\nwidespread doubt and error. Subjective emotions and social custom\nconstitute major obstacles to the disinterested use of reason in the\nquest for objective knowledge. \n\n\nAs soon as one wants to use one\u2019s reason and tries to examine\ncarefully things in themselves, one realizes that one believes only\nwith great doubt most of those things one thought one knew with the\ngreatest certitude. In the conduct of life, one is carried away by\nsome blind inclination or by some custom one lazily follows without\nknowing why. [MM, 1: 373] \n\n\nLike Montaigne and Descartes, Scud\u00e9ry emphasizes how social\ncustom can easily induce the noetic agent into error. But she also\nstresses how the more interior and elusive powers of temperament and\nemotion can color noetic judgment and block the agent from objective\nperception of the external world.\n\nAnother limit to noetic certitude arises from the experiential nature\nof human knowledge. One can only know an object well through personal\nexperience of it. But personal experience entails an irreducible\nsubjectivity of perception. \n\n\nExperience is good for everything. Without it we would have only the\nmost imperfect knowledge of anything. In my opinion, the only thing we\ncannot actually experience is death, because we can only die once.\nConsequently, we cannot know it very well. [EM, 1: 248] \n\n\nIronically, the very experience requisite for thorough knowledge of an\nobject places the knowledge under a veil of doubt since experience\ninevitably carries the imprint of the noetic agent\u2019s subjective\nhistory, emotions, and desires.\n\nOne particular problem in epistemology concerns self-knowledge. In\nOf the Knowledge of Others and of Oneself, Scud\u00e9ry\nargues that self-knowledge can be attained only if one meets certain\nmoral conditions for self-scrutiny. The virtues of justice, sincerity,\nand courage constitute the prerequisites for authentic self-knowledge.\n\n\n\nOne must begin by the desire to know oneself free of all flattery.\nPrincipally, one must observe oneself concerning four things: if one\nis just; if one is sincere; if one is capable of true friendship; if\none has courage [CDS, 1: 103] \n\n\nUnlike Descartes, who proposes an intellectualist path to attain\nknowledge of the internal cogito, Scud\u00e9ry insists on\nthe moral requirements for authentic disclosure of the self. It is the\nfrank desire for an unvarnished and valid knowledge of oneself, a\nknowledge that may reveal the need for moral conversion, which permits\nthe noetic agent to arrive at authentic knowledge of one\u2019s soul.\nOpposed to the Cartesian path of introspection, Scud\u00e9ry insists\nthat self-knowledge can emerge only through scrutiny of one\u2019s\nsocial interaction under the rubric of virtue and vice. \n3.4 Philosophy of Religion\n\nScud\u00e9ry develops her philosophy of religion through two\nprincipal strategies. Positively, she argues that God\u2019s\nexistence can be demonstrated through the philosophical use of reason.\nShe favors a cosmological argument from design. Negatively, she\ncriticizes the religious skepticism of salon libertines as irrational.\nTheir dismissal of theological claims to truth is incoherent with\ntheir avid acceptance of many weaker claims to truth in the secular\ndomain.\n\nGod\u2019s existence can be known through a rational scrutiny of the\ncosmos, which ultimately reveals itself to be the handiwork of a\nsupreme being. The Neo-Epicurean argument that the cosmos\u2019s\nexistence and design can be explained through the random play of\nphysical atoms is untenable, since purely physical substances cannot\ncreate the elaborate laws which govern the universe. Moreover, matter\ncannot create the spirit which is obviously operative in human actions\nof intellect and will. \n\n\nI strongly believe that undepraved human reason can and must know God\nthrough his works and that one can never reasonably think that these\nalleged Atoms\u2014which they are called in order to gain reverence\nfor them\u2014could create the eternal principles of the universe.\n[MM, 1: 432] \n\n\nTypically, Scud\u00e9ry argues that moral defect (depravity) could\nblind someone to God\u2019s existence. Authentic recognition of God\nentails moral judgment, repentance, and conversion. The superficial\nthought of materialists has failed to employ the higher reason of\nmetaphysics in determining the ultimate cause of the existence of the\nphysical and moral worlds. Like moral defect, defective reason can\nprevent someone from recognizing God\u2019s existence.\n\nThe strongest argument for God\u2019s existence is found in the\ndesign of the universe and of the human person. The complex and\nintelligent structure of the physical cosmos and of the human soul can\nonly be explained by the action of a supreme being who possesses\ndivine attributes. \n\n\nHow then can it happen that when human beings consider the admirable\nstructure of the universe and the admirable structure of themselves,\nthey are not inclined to believe they have been created by an\nintelligent, eternal, omnipotent, and unchangeable Being? This Being\nmerits all of our admiration. [MM, 1: 431] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry suggests that the refusal to recognize God as the\nultimate cause of the exquisite structure of the physical universe and\nof the human person is incomprehensible. The refusal to recognize\nGod\u2019s existence in light of this supremely intelligent design\ncan only be explained by a mysterious willfulness.\n\nFor Scud\u00e9ry, the religious skepticism of the libertines in the\nperiod\u2019s salons merits little intellectual respect. Not only is\nthis skepticism generated by the moral license of the libertines; it\ncontrasts badly with the credulity they exhibit in other areas of\nknowledge. \n\n\nThe very people who don\u2019t want to believe in an invisible\nDivinity are very inclined, on the word of a few travelers, to tell\nunbelievable things, such as what they tell us about this marvelous\nstone\u2014called Heliotrope, I believe\u2014which Croesus possesses\namong his treasures and which they claim can make one invisible.\n[CDS, 1: 176] \n\n\nWhereas Christian revelation relies upon the inspired witness of\nScripture and Tradition, the tales of Croesus and other mythical\nfigures rely on the flimsiest hearsay. The libertine case for\nreligious skepticism rests on little more than a credulous,\ninconsistent reason allied with a moral depravity impervious to the\nevangelical call to repent.\n3.5 Aesthetics\n\nIn the dialogues Scud\u00e9ry develops a philosophy of art that\nlargely adheres to neoclassical aesthetics. Art is the imitation of\nnature; nature itself possesses an internal harmony reflective of the\nhidden divine beauty. In her emphasis on the individuality of artistic\nperception and of the individual work of art, however, Scud\u00e9ry\nadds her own subjectivist account of art to the classical mimetic\ntheory to which she subscribes.\n\nOf Magnificence and Of Magnanimity presents\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s mimetic theory of art in capsule form. All art\nrepresents an imitation of nature, \u201cnature\u201d here being\nunderstood as the physical world. \u201cArt has imitated what Nature\nhas made in different places of the world\u201d [CN, 1: 23].\nEach art imitates a particular section of nature. Dance, for example,\nimitates the motion of the stars. \u201cThe people who invented dance\ntook the order and movement of the stars as their model\u201d\n[CN, 1: 38]. Through artistic mimesis, a distinctive sector\nof the natural world is transmuted into a particular genre of art. It\nis this specialized study of material nature that explains the\ndemarcation among the various genres constituting the beaux\narts.\n\nBeauty does not lie solely in the work fashioned by the artist; nature\nitself manifests a complex beauty in each of its discrete parts.\nObservations on Butterflies details the beauty to be found in\nthe structure of the butterfly, one of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s favored\nobjects of scientific observation. \n\n\nThe wings of these little animals account for what is most admirable\nin them. Each butterfly has four wings; their wings are so well\ncoordinated that it seems the butterflies have only two wings when we\nwatch them flying. Their structure is marvelous. They are made of a\nkind of cartilage\u2026which colors the wings of these little\nanimals. It makes them appear thin and transparent, like a fine piece\nof parchment or like a very dry and very clear stroke of the brush.\n[EM, 2: 309] \n\n\nThe artistic construction of a work of art rests on the careful\nimitation of a nature whose intricate structure already expresses a\nharmony matching the beauty produced by the finest artisans and\nartists.\n\nThe artistic mimesis defended by Scud\u00e9ry does not entail a\nservile imitation of nature. On the contrary, each work of art\nrepresents an idiosyncratic interpretation of nature which reflects\nthe unique temperament, style, history, and skill of the individual\nartist. The practice of painting reflects the individual differences\nwhich emerge in works based on careful observation of the same\nphysical object in the same studio setting. \n\n\nIn celebrated academies of painting they have often presented one\nsingle model to the same view of all the artists. They saw him; they\nobserved him; he gave them all the time they wanted without changing\nhis position. Still, I can assure you that even those who depict him\nfrom the same angle will show notable differences in their works.\n[CN, 1: 450] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry adds a subjectivist note to the mimetic account of art.\nAlthough the artist imitates external nature, in fact a single precise\nexternal object in nature, the final work of art portraying that\nnature will bear the idiosyncratic stamp and style of the individual\nartist. Even at its most realistic, the artwork cannot be reduced to a\nfacsimile of the physical cosmos.\n\nAs in the rest of her philosophy, moral considerations weigh heavily\nin Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophy of art. Since art powerfully\nshapes the moral imagination of those who view it, the artist must\nproduce an art that reflects the moral order as well as the physical\norder of nature. Her strictures on the composition of fables, a\nfavorite salon literary genre, express Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s concern\nfor the moral rectitude of the artwork. \n\n\nIt [the fable] should censure vice and reward\nvirtue\u2026.Imagination should always be subordinate to judgment.\nExtraordinary events should be clearly justified\u2026.The style\nshould be neither too elevated nor too low. Nowhere should social\nconventions or morals be offended. [CDS, 2: 475] \n\n\nThe moral strictures on art also reflect the rationalism of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s aesthetics. Even in the realm of the fable, the\nreasonable and the measured should trump the imaginative and the\nfantastic.\n\nGiven its moral pedagogical power, art should be a major political\nconcern. The state should vigorously promote art that both edifies and\npleases by its aesthetic quality. Good public art is particularly apt\nto promote the aristocratic virtues. \u201cWhen the prince promotes\nthem, the love of science and the beaux arts is very helpful\nin establishing the practice of politeness\u201d [CN, 1:\n185]. In her censure of the vice of sloth, Scud\u00e9ry singles out\nfor criticism the indolent artists who do not make the contribution\nthey could make to society\u2019s artistic heritage and moral\natmosphere.\n3.6 Nature and Science\n\nDuring her lifetime, Scud\u00e9ry acquired a reputation as an\namateur botanist and zoologist. Her celebrated garden contained many\nexotic trees and flowers considered difficult to cultivate in the\nParisian climate. Like other pet lovers, she rejected\nDescartes\u2019s theory of the animal as a soulless machine. Her\ndialogue History of Two Chameleons indicates her rejection of\nDescartes\u2019s mechanistic theory of nature in favor of a vitalist\naccount of nature which attributes emotions and even moral qualities\nto non-human animals. The dialogue reflects Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s own\nexperimentation on two chameleons imported from Alexandria and\nentrusted to her care.\n\nKnowledge of the chameleon is acquired by careful observation of its\nphysical features over time. Scud\u00e9ry is especially attentive to\nthe eyes of the chameleon, which pivot in a much wider range than that\npossible for human eyes. Experiments with different types of food\ngradually reveal the chameleon\u2019s eating habits. Careful\nobservation in different environments and lightings cannot resolve the\nquestion of the precise causes of the chameleon\u2019s changes of\ncolor but does yield surprising evidence that changes in temperature\nappear to effect substantial alterations in coloration. Months-long\nobservation leads Scud\u00e9ry to the conclusion that classification\nof the chameleon as a reptile is mistaken: \n\n\nIt is wrong to call [the chameleon] a reptile. Its stomach never\ntouches the earth, not even when it is walking or even sleeping. At\nthose times it rests on its feet and on its tail. [CN,\n2:503]\n\n\nFor Scud\u00e9ry, proper observation of nature is necessarily an\naesthetic observation. In her study of the chameleon, she often\nrecounts the animal\u2019s beauty. \u201cThis animal has a slow,\ngrave, and majestic walk\u201d [CN, 2: 503]. She repeatedly\nrecords the beauty of the varied spotting manifest by the chameleon.\n\n\n\nNearly everyday at several different moments, it had the most\nbeautiful spots in the world: from the top of its head to the end of\nits tail and to the bottom of its little fingers. [CN, 2: 513]\n\n\n\nThe chameleon also manifests emotional and moral qualities.\nScud\u00e9ry claims that her two chameleons showed a clear affection\nfor each other. \n\n\nDuring the five weeks I had the animals together, I noticed an intense\naffection between them. Neither ever showed the least chagrin.\n[CN, 2: 515] \n\n\nThe older chameleon even seems to possess moral as well as emotional\ntraits. Happiness appears to be maximal in midday. \n\n\nIt seems to me that when my chameleon had the best spotting was the\nmoment when he seemed the happiest and at is his best. This was\nusually midday from ten in the morning until three or four in the\nafternoon. [CN, 2: 528] \n\n\nSadness and even a certain sloth seem to characterize early morning.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw him the next day I found him very sad. Still, he heard me\nand recognized who I was, as he usually did. But I saw that he was\nvery lazy in his rising. [CN, 2: 532] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s interpretation of the natural world is not only\nempirical; it involves a sympathetic and aesthetic embrace of material\nnature. \n3.7 Philosophy of Gender\n\nQuestions of gender and sexuality suffuse the entire corpus of\nScud\u00e9ry. Her prolix novels celebrate an egalitarian love\nbetween men and women. Despite their exotic settings, they condemn the\ntypical oppressions endured by the era\u2019s women: forced marriage,\nabduction, and domestic violence. Her fictitious orations emphasize\nthe right of women to exercise political authority.\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s defense of the right of women to participate in\nthe public sphere of civil society is particularly emphatic in her\nwritings focused on the figure of the poet Sappho. As Newman argues in\nher edition of these writings (2003), The Story of Sappho,\nembedded in the novel Artam\u00e8ne or the Great Cyrus, and\nthe Harangue of Sappho, the twentieth of the speeches\npresented in Illustrious Women or Heroic Harangues, clearly\nindict the social repression of women. The institution of marriage\nitself serves as an object of censure.\n\nThe Harangue of Sappho presents Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nphilosophy of gender in lapidary form. Speaking to her auditor Erinne,\nSappho condemns the denial of women\u2019s rights to education and\nself-expression through a cult of false humility. A distorted virtue\nof modesty has reduced women to silence. \n\n\nYou must overcome the doubt concerning yourself that is planted in\nyour soul. It is this false modesty which prevents you from employing\nyour mind to achieve all that it is capable of attempting.\n[FI, 1, 423\u2013424] \n\n\nThis anti-intellectual modesty, which women are supposed to cultivate\nas one of the distinguishing traits of their sex, has only made women\ndoubt their own worth. Modesty has condemned self-expression to the\nstatus of a sin.\n\nEven graver in this silencing of women is society\u2019s sharp\ndemarcation between gender roles in the public square. Women are to\nexcel in the cultivation of physical beauty and the social graces; men\nare to excel in the pursuit of art and science. \n\n\nPeople who claim that beauty is woman\u2019s sphere and that the arts\nand letters and all the liberal and rarified sciences belong to\nmen\u2014and that we women are barred from them\u2014are very far\nfrom either truth or justice. [FI,1: 424] \n\n\nTo contest this gendered differentiation in the sphere of study and\nwork, women must recognize that the set of beliefs supporting this\nsexual segregation is simply a \u201ccustom and corruption of our\ntime\u201d [FI,  426]. In fact, society offers numerous\ncounter-examples of men who focus on the development of physical\nbeauty and social charm and of women who excel in scientific culture\nand intellectual debate. Both men and women can develop the powers of\nanalysis and judgment as well as those of imagination. To refuse women\nthe right to develop their intellectual gifts is to oppose Nature\nitself, which has clearly equipped women with such capacities. \n\n\nThe gods have made nothing useless in all nature\u2026.Now, why\nshould we women be the only ones supposed to rebel against this\nnatural order as if we were ungrateful to the gods? Why should our\nminds be kept in a perpetual state of uselessness and\nmediocrity?\u2026.No reason could possibly justify the belief that\nwhat is infinitely admirable in itself is supposedly wrong and\ncriminal in ourselves. [FI,1: 432] \n\n\nThe development of women\u2019s intellectual capacity requires the\nrefutation of the social prejudices concerning gender differentiation.\nThis refutation must demonstrate how these damaging prejudices\ncontradict the order of nature itself.\n\nTo liberate women\u2019s intellectual gifts, Scud\u00e9ry\nprivileges the role of writing. In writing and publishing her work, a\nwoman attracts acclaim in the future as well as in the present. The\nact of writing is far superior to being written about by others in the\nfashionable literary portraits of the time. \n\n\nIt is better to grant immortality to others than to receive it from\nothers. It is better to find glory within yourself than to borrow it\nfrom somewhere else\u2026.Poetry has many advantages. You only have\nto encourage others to speak about you in order to make yourself known\nto posterity. If you simply speak with good grace, you will be known\nwell enough\u2026.You have only to condemn the vices of your time\nand society will not fail to laud you. [FI,1: 438] \n\n\nThe writing of social criticism is especially appropriate for women\nwho have overcome the social stereotypes imprisoning women in the\nprivate sphere of sentiment. \n4. Reception and Interpretation\n\nToward the end of her long life, Scud\u00e9ry faced the mixed\nreception which would be the destiny of her works for centuries to\ncome. Her writings, especially her novels, reached an enormous\ncultivated public. Thousands of readers anxiously awaited the\nappearance of a new chapter in the serials. The royalties and\ngovernment pensions attached to her writings permitted her to live\ncomfortably in the fashionable Marais neighborhood. The translation of\nher works into English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Arabic indicates\nthe breadth of her appreciative public. But an influential literary\nelite dismissed her works as illegible and unintelligible.\nMoli\u00e8re, Fureti\u00e8re, and Boileau caricatured\nScud\u00e9ry as a pendant whose picaresque tales and inconclusive\ndialogues only masked intellectual confusion. A leading literary\ncritic, Nicolas Boileau\u2019s criticism proved especially\ninfluential in subsequent dismissals of the thought of Scud\u00e9ry.\nIn Satire X, Boileau argues that the type of love celebrated\nby Scud\u00e9ry is immoral. \n\n\nYou can see this in Cl\u00e9lie, where the heroine receives\nher lovers under the delicate name of friend. At first, she only takes\nsmall, permissible liberties. But soon you are in deep waters on the\nriver of Tendre and you can navigate at will. [OC,\n67] \n\n\nBoileau\u2019s critique in Dialogue on Heroes of the Novel\nis more categorical. He denounces Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s works \n\n\nfor their lack of seriousness, for their airs, for their vague and\nsuperficial dialogues, for their fawning portraits of quite mediocre\npeople, even on occasion very ugly people, and for their interminable\nand verbose effusions on love. [OC, 445] \n\n\nThis critical portrait has remained influential in the negative\nappraisal of Scud\u00e9ry down to the present.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the rehabilitation of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s intellectual reputation began. President of the\nSorbonne, Victor Cousin (1858) studied how Scudery\u2019s writings\nreflected the salon society of the period. Despite his own\nphilosophical pedigree, however, Cousin evinced more interest in\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s role as salon hostess than in her own\nphilosophical theories. The current revival of interest in\nScud\u00e9ry is tied to the contemporary feminist expansion of the\ncanon of the humanities in order to include the voices of women\nauthors who had been neglected due to misogynist bias. The new English\ntranslations and commentaries by Newman (2003) and Donawerth and\nStrongson (2004) focus on the writings of Scud\u00e9ry treating\nissues of gender. Recent studies by Beasley (1990), De Jean (1991),\nDuggan (2017), Goldsmith (1988), Harth (1992), and Timmermans (1993)\nhave situated the works and theories of Scud\u00e9ry in the context\nof women\u2019s writing, salon culture, and the various attitudes\ntoward women in the France of early modernity. Burch (2013) examines\nin what sense she can be considered a philosopher, specifically a\n\u201cfemme philosophe\u201d of the period. Hogg (2018) and Suzuki\n(2018) analyze her political theory while Duggan (2016) and Sahlins\n(2015) explore her approach to science. Although these contemporary\neditions of and commentaries on Scud\u00e9ry have underscored the\ngendered nature of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s philosophy, they have tended\nto neglect other dimensions of her thought. Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nphilosophy of virtue, religion, art, and knowledge invites further\nexploration.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry": ["</h3>\n<h4>Cited Works</h4>\n<p>\nCitations are to the page numbers of the original French version.\nPassages from the French quoted in this entry are translated by John\nConley. </p>\n<table class=\"vert-top cellpad-small cell-rl\">\n<tr>", "[<em>CN</em>]", "<em>Conversations nouvelles sur divers sujets</em>, 2 vols.,\nParis: C.
