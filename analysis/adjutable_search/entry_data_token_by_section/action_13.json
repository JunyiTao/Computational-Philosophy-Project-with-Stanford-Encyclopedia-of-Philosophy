    "main_text": "The Ontology of Actions\n5. The Ontology of Actions\n\nWhat are actions? The traditional answer is: they are events\nof a certain sort (e.g. events with a distinctive causal history).\nThat, at any rate, is the letter of the views found in Anscombe\n(1957), Davidson (1963; 1967a; 1967b; 1985), and much subsequent\nliterature. However, some scholars have recently argued that\nAnscombe\u2019s position is better captured by the claim that actions\nare processes, and that there are philosophical advantages to\nthis view. Yet, others take actions to be something else altogether.\nThis section explains what this dispute is about, and explores some of\nits implications for other ontological debates such as the\nindividuation of action. It then considers further important questions\nabout the metaphysics of action, such as whether there must be basic\nactions, and whether Action constitutes a unified\ncategory.\n",
