    "main_text": "Existential Phenomenology and the Philosophy of Life\n6. Existential Phenomenology and the Philosophy of Life\n\nIn the early 1930s Ortega formulated, in a systematic fashion, his\ngeneral philosophical standpoint\u2014positing human life as the\nultimate reality\u2014which contains philosophy within history. He\npresents it in his book En Torno a Galileo (1933), by way of\nhis theory of generations, and in his essay History as a\nSystem (1935). The \u201cconcept of being\u201d or \u201chuman\nlife\u201d, for Ortega, \u201cis the very root of philosophy\u201d,\nand, therefore \u201cany reform of the idea of being means a radical\nreform in philosophy\u201d. At this point, he abandoned the\n\u201cbiological organism\u201d content of his earlier notion of\nlife in The Theme of Our Time to incorporate a concept of\nlife\u2014\u201cthe life of each one of us\u201d\u2014as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world. \u201cBiologists\u201d, he\naverred,\n\n\nuse the word \u201clife\u201d in order to designate the phenomena of\norganic beings\u2026but\u2026when we give this word a meaning\nwhich is more immediate, broader and more decisive. (Obras,\nIII: 166).\n\n\nIn this broader connection, Ortega\u2019s concept of human life comprised a\ndimension which was similar to the Fundamentalontologie of\nHeidegger\u2019s Daseinanalyse. Ortega\u2019s analysis of human\nexistence and human life characterized \u201cI am I and my\ncircumstances\u201d as the interchangeable interaction of the\n\u201cI\u201d and \u201cthe world\u201d. That is, \u201cI am\nalways with myself\u2026the world is always linked with me and my\nbeing is a being with the world\u201d (Obras, VII: 394, 405,\n402). Ortega wanted to liberate the \u201cI\u201d from the\n\u201cinternal prison\u201d of \u201csubjectivism\u201d and\nproposed that we \u201csave ourselves in the world\u201d, in\n\u201cthat vital horizon\u201d. This sense of being as having been\n\u201cthrown into\u201d the \u201cworld\u201d further\ncharacterizes the authentic reality of life as \u201cfinding oneself\nface to face with the world\u201d and \u201cinside the world\u201d\n(Obras, VII: 411, 416\u201317, 430; compare Heidegger 1927\n[1962: 236, 399]). To \u201cescape from idealism\u201d, then,\n\u201clife includes both the subject [the conscious self] and the\nworld\u201d. Living is \u201cfinding oneself in the\nworld\u201d. Hence:\n\n\nLife always finds itself in certain circumstances, in an arrangement\nsurrounding it\u2014circum\u2014filled with things and other people.\nOne does not live in a world which is vague, except that the vital\nworld is circumstance [the things and the people around one]; it is\nthis world, here and now. (Obras, VII: 422, 431)\n\n\nOrtega considered Dilthey one of the \u201cfirst discoverers\u201d\nof \u201cthe new great Idea of life\u201d, who has \u201ctaught us\nmore radically than any of his predecessors\u2014Hegel,\nComte\u2014to see historicity as a constitutive feature of the human\nbeing\u201d (Obras, VI: 166; IX: 396). After the posthumous\npublication of Dilthey\u2019s Gesammelte Schriften in 1928 and\nOrtega\u2019s subsequent \u201cacquaintance\u201d with Dilthey\u2019s\nphilosophical work, we begin to observe the eventual unfolding of a\ngeneral systematic statement of human life in Ortega\u2019s philosophy and\nhistorical thought. The years surrounding Ortega\u2019s absorption of\nDilthey\u2019s writings suggest that he derived from Dilthey a sense of\nhistoricity, which he previously had never possessed. He assigned, as\ndid Dilthey, history the task of supplying human life\u2019s only\n\u201cfixed, pre-established, and given line\u201d, of converting\nitself into the \u201chistorical reason\u201d which secures the one\nkind of continuous, empirical progress of which the individual is\ncapable. We also observe that, in addition to the influences of\nhistoricism and phenomenology, Ortega also integrated existential\nphilosophy into his general philosophical orientation. During the late\n1920s and 1930s, of his intellectual development, Ortega incorporated\nthe idea of human life into his fundamental philosophical outlook, and\nthe discernible transition from \u201cvital reason\u201d to\n\u201chistorical reason\u201d occurred in his thought. That is, once\nhuman life was established as the basis of his philosophical\nstandpoint, \u201cvital reason\u201d and \u201chistorical\nreason\u201d became interchangeable terms for Ortega (Obras,\nV: 538, VI: 39\u201341). Though he spoke of a parallelism between the\nideas of Dilthey and his own, during the period 1914 and 1929, and\nalthough his insistence on the fact that he discussed the notion of\n\u201cvial reason\u201d prior to the early 1930s remains accurate,\nthere was no such discussion of \u201chistorical reason\u201d in the\nmanner in which one has become familiar with its usage in his mature\nwritings of the 1930s. After the publication of his lectures, What\nIs Philosophy? (1929) and his essay on Dilthey,\n\u201clife\u201d and \u201creason\u201d and \u201cvital\nreason\u201d\u2014or \u201cliving reason\u201d\u2014and\n\u201chistorical reason\u201d were central concepts in the fusion of\nhis systematic analysis of man, society and history. Through the\ninfluence of the basic idea of Dilthey\u2019s Lebensphilosophie,\nOrtega was able to link his ontological point of view with his\nexistentialist and historicist viewpoints. The correlation of these\nconcepts, which placed a common emphasis upon the actions and the\ncreations of the individual, the facticity and the uniqueness of\nindividual human existence, makes explicit Ortega\u2019s connectedness to\nLebensphilosophie: \u201c Life\u201d, Dilthey averred, \u201c is\nthe inner relationship of mental processes within a person. Knowledge\nof life is growing awareness of, and reflection on, life.\u201d\n(Dilthey [1976: 125]). \u201cThe significance of life,\u201d he\ncontended further, \u201clies in its shaping and its\ndevelopment.\u201d (Dilthey [1962: 88]. Existential philosophy, in a\nvariety of ways, had been an outgrowth of Lebensphilosophie\nand phenomenology, and Ortega, with the complement of the historicist\nviewpoint of the \u201cunique individual\u201d and of \u201chuman\nlife\u201d as the ultimate reality, appears to have pursued the path\nwhich had been directed by both Dilthey and Heidegger (Misch 1931:\n5\u2013197, 216\u201337).\n\nIn his works in the 1930s, Ortega posited \u201chuman life\u201d as\nultimate reality and, from this standpoint, connected the historicist\nphilosophical point of view that of existential phenomenology. The\nexistentialist perspective of Ortega closely resembles the\nFundamentalontologie or existentiale Analytik in\nHeidegger\u2019s Sein und Zeit. (Heidegger 1927 [1962: 21\u201383\n; Spiegelberg 1960: 62\u201374; Spiegelberg 1965: vol. 1,\n408\u2013413). Through the epistemological standpoint of \u201cI am\nI and my circumstances\u201d, the individual, in realizing the\n\u201cvital possibilities\u201d of the essence of his being, engages\nactively in the human world. The process of the realization of man\u2019s\n\u201cvital possibilities\u201d\u2014through the\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d of his being\u2014as a\nbeing-in-the-making and as a being-that-goes-on-being-in-the-world,\nOrtega characterized as a \u201cdrama\u201d which\n\u201chappens\u201d. Ortega\u2019s notions of \u201clife as a\nhappening\u201d, the insecurity of human life in the face of death,\nthe ontological distinction between human life and things and between\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cauthentic being\u201d, are strikingly\nsimilar to ideas which had been formulated by Heidegger in 1927. In\nWhat Is Philosophy? he aligned his philosophical position\nwith that of Heidegger and the \u201cnew philosophy\u201d of being,\nexistence, and human life:\n\n\nThese common words, finding oneself, world, occupying oneself, are now\ntechnical words in this new philosophy. One would be able to talk for\na long time on each one of them, but I will limit myself to observe\nthat this definition, \u201cto live is to find oneself in a\nworld\u201d, like all the principal ideas in these lectures, is\nalready in my published work. It is important to me to observe this,\nespecially, with regard to the idea of existence, for which I claim\nchronological priority. For that very reason I am pleased to\nacknowledge that the person who has gone deepest into the analysis of\nlife is the new German philosopher, Martin Heidegger.\n\n\u2026To live is to find oneself in the world. Heidegger, in a very\nrecent work of genius, has made us take notice of all the enormous\nsignificance of these words. (Obras, VI: 40\u201341; VII:\n415\u201316)\n\n\nOrtega was quite sensitive to implications drawn on the affinities\nbetween his work and Heidegger\u2019s, which, in part, explains his efforts\nto trace the originality of his formulations to his\nMeditations. Apart from a general discussion in his Idea\nof Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory\n(Obras, VIII: 270\u2013300), and the essay\n\u201cMartin Heidegger and Language of the\nPhilosophers\u201d(Universitas, 7(9) [1952]: 897\u2013903, Obras,\nIX: 625\u201344), Ortega referred to Heidegger only in passing in a\nlong footnote in his essay, \u201cGoethe from Within\u201d (1932)\nObras, 4: 403\u201304, 541. Whatever the context in which\nthis controversy over Ortega\u2019s intellectual indebtedness to Heidegger\nmay have been initiated, it was during this decisive period of the\n1930s that he turned to the systematic formulation of the philosophy\nof Lebensphilosophie, and it was also in this period that\nOrtega\u2019s explicit postulation of the notion \u201cI am I and my\ncircumstances\u201d, as radical reality, reflected the influence of\nexistential and phenomenological points of view in his philosophy of\nexistence, man and society.\n\nWhile Ortega\u2019s general ontological position does bear some\nsimilarities to Heidegger\u2019s existentiale Analytik, and while\nhis idea of human life shows some affinities with Dilthey\u2019s\nLebensphilosophie, there are also differences between these\nphilosophies and Ortega\u2019s fundamental philosophical position. The\nimportant difference to point out pertains to the observation that\nOrtega proceeded beyond the distinctive positions of\nDaseinanalyse and Lebensanalyse by incorporating the\ntwo concepts. That is, for Ortega, analysis of being and the analysis\nof human life constituted at once the systematic analysis of the\nexistence of man in his \u201clived-relations\u201d and his\n\u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d. Furthermore, Ortega makes explicit\nthe connection between the concept of historical time and the concept\nof everyday reality in that temporality constitutes the basic relation\nbetween human beings and their activities in the world.\n",
