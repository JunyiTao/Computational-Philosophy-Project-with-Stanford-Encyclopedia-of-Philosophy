    "main_text": "Fifth Case Study: Social Epistemology || Mistrust & Polarization\n5.2 Mistrust & Polarization\n\nLet\u2019s switch now to a different use of these epistemic network\nmodels. So far our doctors updated on each other\u2019s data as if it\nwere their own. But what if they mistrust one another? It\u2019s\nnatural to have less than full faith in those whose opinions differ\nfrom your own. They seem to have gone astray somewhere, after all. And\neven if not, their views may have illicitly influenced their\nresearch.\n\nSo maybe our doctors won\u2019t take the data shared by others at\nface value. Suppose instead they discount it, especially when the\nsource\u2019s viewpoint differs greatly from their own.\nO\u2019Connor & Weatherall (2018) and Weatherall &\nO\u2019Connor (forthcoming) explore this possibility, and find that\nit can lead to polarization. Instead of the community reaching a\nconsensus, some doctors in the community may abandon the new\ntreatment, even while others conclude that it\u2019s superior.\n\nIn the example animated below, doctors in blue have credence above .5,\nso they experiment with the new treatment, sharing the results with\neveryone. Doctors in green have credence .5 or below, but are still\npersuadable. They still trust the blue doctors enough to update on\ntheir results\u2014though they discount these results more the\ngreater their difference of opinion with the doctor who generated\nthem. Finally, red doctors ignore results entirely. They\u2019re so\nfar from all the blue doctors that they don\u2019t trust them at\nall.\n\n\nExample of polarization in the O\u2019Connor-Weatherall model \n[Alternative link to video]\n\n\nIn this simulation, we reach a point where there are no more green\ndoctors, only unpersuadable skeptics in red and highly confident\nbelievers in blue. And the blues have become so confident,\nthey\u2019re unlikely to ever move close enough to any of the reds to\nget their ear. So we\u2019ve reached a stable state of\npolarization.\n\nHow often does such polarization occur? It depends on the size of the\ncommunity, and on the \u201crate of mistrust.\u201d To program this\nmodel, we have to decide how much one doctor discounts another\u2019s\ndata, given their difference of opinion. This \"rate of mistrust\" is an\nadjustable parameter in the model.\n\nHere\u2019s how these two factors\u2014community size and rate of\nmistrust\u2014affect the probability of polarization. (Note that we\nonly consider complete networks here.)\n\n\nProbability of polarization depends on community size and rate of mistrust.\n\n\nSo, the more doctors are inclined to mistrust one another, the more\nlikely they are to end up polarized. No surprise there. But larger\ncommunities are also more disposed to polarize. Why?\n\nAs O\u2019Connor & Weatherall explain, the more doctors there\nare, the more likely it is that strong skeptics will be present at the\nstart of inquiry: doctors with credence well below .5. These doctors\nwill tend to ignore the reports of the optimists experimenting with\nthe new treatment. So they anchor a skeptical segment of the\npopulation.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve glossed over an important detail of O\u2019Connor\n& Weatherall\u2019s model. How does the discounting work, and how\ndo doctor\u2019s update on discounted evidence? When Dr.\u00a0X\nreports data \\(E\\) to Dr.\u00a0Y, Y doesn\u2019t simply\nconditionalize on \\(E\\). That would mean they take X\u2019s report at\nface value. So what do they do?\n\nTo compute their updated credence \\(p'(H)\\) in the new\ntreatment\u2019s superiority, Y takes a weighted average of\n\\(p(H \\mid E)\\) and \\(p(H \\mid \\neg E)\\). This\nprocedure is a famous variation on conditionalization known as\n Jeffrey Conditionalization:\n\nJeffrey Conditionalization\n\nGiven the prior probability assignments \\(p(H\\mid E)\\) and \\(p(H\\mid\n\\neg E)\\), the new, unconditional probability assignment to \\(H\\) upon\nlearning \\(E\\) with level of certainty \\(p'(E)\\) should be:\n\n\\[p'(H) = p(H \\mid E)p'(E) + p(H \\mid \\neg E)p'(\\neg E).\\]\n\n \n\nThis formula looks a lot like the law of total probability\n(\u00a71.2.1), but there\u2019s a crucial difference. The weights in\nthis weighted average are not \\(p(E)\\) and \\(p(\\neg E)\\). They are\ninstead \\(p'(E)\\) and \\(p'(\\neg E)\\). They are the updated,\nalready-discounted probabilities Y assigns to X\u2019s report and its\nnegation.\n\nO\u2019Connor & Weatherall (2018) suggest a natural formula for\ncomputing \\(p'(E)\\) and \\(p'(\\neg E)\\), which we won\u2019t go into\nhere. We\u2019ll just note that the choice of formula is crucial to the\npolarization effect. Mistrust doesn\u2019t necessarily introduce the\npossibility of polarization; the mistrust has to be sufficiently\nstrong (greater than 1.0 in the above figure). There has to be a point\nat which agents won\u2019t trust each other at all because their difference\nof opinion is so great. Otherwise the skeptics would never ignore\ntheir optimistic colleagues entirely, so they\u2019d eventually be won over\nby their encouraging reports.\n\nThis illustrates a general issue with update rules like Jeffrey\nConditionalization: to apply them, we first need to determine the new\nprobabilities to assign to the evidence. From there we can determine\nthe new probabilities of other propositions. But this essential bit of\ninput is something for which we don\u2019t have a rule; it\u2019s a\nsort of loose end in the formal system, something that\u2019s left up\nto us as users of the model. For some discussion of the\nepistemological significance of this point, see Field (1978) and\nChristensen (1992).\n\nFor a different formal approach to polarization, see Dorst (2020, \nOther Internet Resources). For\nother work on network epistemology see Zollman (2013) and\n \u00a74.3 of the entry on social epistemology,\n and the references therein.\n\nOther formal projects in social epistemology include work on the\nrelationship between social and individual rationality (Mayo-Wilson,\nZollman, and Danks 2011); on judgment aggregation/opinion pooling\n(Genest and Zidek 1986; List and Pettit 2002; Russell, Hawthorne, and\nBuchak 2015); on learning from the beliefs of others (Easwaran et\nal 2016; Bradley 2018); and on the social benefits of competing\nupdate rules, such as Conditionalization vs.\u00a0Inference to the\nBest Explanation (Douven and Wenmackers 2017; Pettigrew m.s., \nOther Internet Resources).\n",
