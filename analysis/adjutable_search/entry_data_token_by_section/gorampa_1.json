    "main_text": "Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka\n2. Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka\n\nGorampa, like all of his M\u0101dhyamika interlocutors, appeals to the\nauthority of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. As such, most disagreements between\nGorampa and his opponents primarily concern the correct ways to\ninterpret the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and his commentators. While\nGorampa and his opponents generally agree that a Buddhist must\nunderstand the nature of reality by eliminating ignorance and\nrealizing emptiness, what sets Gorampa apart from other\nM\u0101dhyamikas is the way in which he articulates reality, and the\nprocesses by which he argues that one must eliminate ignorance and\nrealize emptiness.\n\nWith this in mind, there are four defining characteristics of\nGorampa\u2019s philosophy that set him apart from other Tibetan\nphilosophers. They are his understandings of: (1) the two truths; (2)\nnegation and the tetralemma; (3) the role of logic and reasoning; and\n(4) proper methods of argumentation on the path to awakening.\n",
