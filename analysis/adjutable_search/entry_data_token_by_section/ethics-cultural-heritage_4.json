    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage? || Heritage vs. History\n1.4 Heritage vs. History\n\nConsonant with the idea that heritage is inherently concerned with the\nuse of the past for present purposes, some commentators are at pains\nto point out the difference between a more political understanding of\nheritage in contrast with a more scholarly understanding of history\n(e.g., Lowenthal 1985). They emphasize in particular heritage\u2019s\nlax relationship with the truth:\n\n\nHistory seeks to convince by truth and succumbs to falsehood. Heritage\nexaggerates and omits, candidly inverts and frankly forgets, and\nthrives on ignorance and terror. (Lowenthal 1998: 121)\n\n\nHowever, one might worry that this statement contrasts an ideal of\nhistorical scholarship with a caricature of heritage at its worst.\nHistorians, too, are subject to concerns about how their narratives\nportray and map onto the record of past events (Trouillot 1995; entry\non\n philosophy of history).\n We might think that heritage, too, should be constrained by the\ntruth, even when it operates in the service of nationalism (Abizadeh\n2004).\n",
