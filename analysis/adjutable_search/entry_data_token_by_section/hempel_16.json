    "main_text": "Inductive-Statistical Explanation || The Requirement of Maximal Specificity\n6.1 The Requirement of Maximal Specificity\n\nHempel referred to statistical explanations as\n\u201cinductive-statistical\u201d in contrast with his prior\ndiscussion of \u201cdeductive-nomological\u201d explanations (Hempel\n1958). Because generalizations of both kinds are supposed to be\nlawlike, however, more appropriate names for them might have been\n\u201cuniversal-deductive\u201d and\n\u201cstatistical-inductive\u201d (or, perhaps,\n\u201cstatistical-probabilistic\u201d, respectively (Fetzer 1974).\nIn formalizing these arguments, Hempel symbolized statistical premises\nattributing a certain probability to outcome \\(G\\),\nunder conditions \\(F\\), by \u201c\\(P(G, F) =\nr\\)\u201d, where these explanations then assume this form:\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(G,F) = r\\) \n\n\\(Fc\\)\n\\([r]\\) \n\n\\(Gc\\)  \n\n\nFigure 7. An I-S Explanation Schema\n\n\nWhile Hempel initially interpreted the bracketed variable [\\(r\\)]\nas the measure of inductive support which the\nexplanans confers upon the explanandum, \\(Gi\\), (in conformity with\nthe requirement of total evidence)\u2014where the value of [\\(r\\)]\nequals that of \\(r\\)\u2014it\noccurred to him that, since inductive and deductive explanations are\ntypically offered on the basis of the knowledge that their explanandum\nevents have already occurred, viewing statistical explanations as\ninductive arguments whose purpose is to establish how we know that\nthey have occurred (or that they will occur) is not the correct\nperspective for understanding them:\n\n\nthe point of an explanation is not to provide evidence for the\noccurrence of the explanandum, but to exhibit it as nomically\nexpectable. And the probability attached to an I-S explanation is\nthe probability of the conclusion relative to the explanatory\npremises, not relative to the total class \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) [representing\nour total knowledge at that time]. (Hempel 1968, original\nemphasis)\n\n\nIn order to formalize this conception, he advanced the concept of\na maximally specific predicate related to \u201cGi\u201d in\n\\(\\mathbf{K},\\) where, when \u201c\\(P(G, F) = r\\)\u201d, then, if\nthe premises include a predicate stronger than \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d,\nsay, \u201c\\(M\\)\u201d, which implies the presence of more\nproperties than does \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d, then \\(P(G, M) = r,\\) where,\nas before, \\(r = P(G,F).\\) Thus additional predicates could be\nincluded in the explanans of an adequate scientific explanation,\nprovided that they made no difference to the nomic expectability of\nthe explanandum. Including the position of the moon or the day of the\nweek a match is struck, for example, might be irrelevant, but his\ncondition did not exclude them.  Wesley C. Salmon (1970), however,\nwould pursue this issue by arguing that Hempel had embraced the wrong\nstandard upon which to base explanatory relevance relations, where\nexplanations, in Salmon\u2019s view, strictly speaking, do not even\nqualify as arguments.\n",
