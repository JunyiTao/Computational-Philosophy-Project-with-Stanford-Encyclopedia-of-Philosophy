    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || Just Institutions: The Four-Stage Sequence\n4.9 Just Institutions: The Four-Stage Sequence\n\nThe two parts of the argument for justice as fairness above occur at\nthe first stage of the original position. At this first stage, the\nparties also agree to a principle of just savings to regulate\nhow much each generation must save for future generations. Since the\nparties do not know which era the citizens they represent live in, it\nis rational for them to choose a savings principle that is fair to all\ngenerations. Rawls says that the parties need not choose a savings\nprinciple that requires endless economic growth. Rather, the parties\nmay prefer a Millian \u201csteady state\u201d of zero real growth,\nonce a generation has been reached in which the two principles are\nsatisfied.\n\nAfter agreeing on the two principles and a principle of just savings,\nthe parties then proceed further through the four-stage\nsequence, tailoring these general principles to the particular\nconditions of the society of the citizens they represent. Through this\nfour-stage sequence, the veil of ignorance that screens out\ninformation about society\u2019s general features gradually becomes\nthinner, and the parties use the new information to decide on\nprogressively more determinate applications of the principles already\nagreed upon. The parties, that is, progressively fill in the\ninstitutional details of what justice requires in the real world.\n\nAt the second stage of the original position, the parties are given\nmore information about society\u2019s political culture and economic\ndevelopment, and take on the task of crafting a constitution\nthat realizes the two principles of justice. At the third stage, the\nparties learn still more about the details of society, and agree to\nspecific legislation that realize the two principles within\nthe constitutional framework decided at the second stage. At the\nfourth stage, the parties have full information about society, and\nreason as judges and administrators to apply the\npreviously-agreed legislation to particular cases. When the four\nstages are complete, the principles of justice as fairness are fully\narticulated for society\u2019s political life.\n\nTo illustrate: at the constitutional (second) and legislative (third)\nstages, the parties specify basic liberties such as \u201cfreedom of\nthought\u201d into more particular rights, like the right to free\npolitical speech. The right to political speech is itself then further\nspecified as the right to criticize the government, the rights\nprotecting the press from political interference, and so on. Through\nthe four-stage sequence, the parties also adjust the basic liberties\nto fit with one another and with other values, always aiming for an\noverall scheme of liberties that will best enable citizens to develop\nand exercise their two moral powers and pursue their determinate\nconceptions of the good (PL, 289\u2013371).\n\nAt the later stages, the parties also work out the institutions that\nwill be necessary to realize the fair value of the equal political\nliberties. On this topic, Rawls is adamant: unless there are public\nfunds for elections, restrictions on campaign contributions, and\nsubstantially equal access to the media, politics will be captured by\nconcentrations of private economic power. This will make it impossible\nfor equally-able citizens to have equal opportunities to influence\npolitics regardless of their wealth, as fair value demands. As he says\nin a discussion of public reason, public deliberation must be\n\u201cset free from the curse of money\u201d (PL, 449).\n\nThe parties attempt to realize the second principle of justice at the\nlegislative stage, by shaping the laws that regulate property,\ncontract, taxation, inheritance, hiring, minimum wages, and so on.\nTheir task is not to allocate some fixed set of goods that appear from\nnowhere, but rather to devise a set of institutions for education,\nproduction, and distribution whose operation will realize fair\nequality of opportunity and the difference principle over time.\n\nFor fair equality of opportunity, Rawls emphasizes that laws and\npolicies must go beyond merely preventing discrimination in education\nand hiring. To ensure fair opportunity regardless of social class of\norigin, the state must also fund high-quality education for the less\nwell-off. Moreover, the state must also guarantee both a basic minimum\nincome and health care for all.\n\nOn realizing the difference principle, Rawls says that the goal is an\neconomic order that maximizes the position of the worst-off group\n(e.g., unskilled laborers, or those with less than half of the median\nwealth and income over their lifetimes). Given that institutions\nrealizing the prior principles are already in place, this should be\napproximately achievable by, for example, varying marginal rates of\ntax and tax exemptions.\n\nRawls explicitly rejects the welfare state (JF,\n137\u201340). Welfare-state capitalism leaves control of the economy\nin the hands of a group of rich private actors. It therefore fails to\nensure for all citizens enough resources to have roughly equal chances\nof influencing politics, or to have sufficiently equal opportunities\nin education and employment. The welfare state therefore tends to\ngenerate a demoralized under-class.\n\nLaissez-faire capitalism is even worse for equality than the welfare\nstate along these dimensions. And a socialist command economy would\nput too much power in the hands of the state, again endangering\npolitical equality and also threatening basic liberties such as free\nchoice of employment.\n\nJustice as fairness, Rawls says, favors either a property-owning\ndemocracy or liberal (democratic) socialism. The government of a\nproperty-owning democracy takes steps to encourage widespread\nownership of productive assets and broad access to education and\ntraining. Liberal socialism is similar, but features worker-managed\nfirms. The aim of both systems of political economy is to enable all\ncitizens, even the least advantaged, to manage their own affairs\nwithin a context of significant social and economic equality.\n\u201cThe least advantaged are not, if all goes well, the unfortunate\nand unlucky\u2014objects of our charity and compassion, much less our\npity\u2014but those to whom reciprocity is owed as a matter of basic\njustice\u201d (JF, 139).\n4.10 The Original Position and Political Constructivism\n\nRawls describes the original position as a useful device for reaching\ngreater reflective equilibrium. He holds that the value of the\noriginal position as a method of reasoning is affirmed when it selects\nthe first principle of justice, since the first principle accords with\nmany people\u2019s settled convictions about the importance of\nassuring the basic rights and liberties for all. Having gained\ncredibility by confirming these settled moral judgments, the original\nposition then goes on to select principles for issues on which\npeople\u2019s judgments may be less certain, such as how society\nshould structure employment opportunities, and what a just\ndistribution of wealth and income might be.\n\nIn this way, the original position first confirms and then extends\ncommon judgments about justice. For Rawls it is important that the\nsame method of reasoning that explains the equal basic liberties also\njustifies more political and economic equality than many people might\nhave initially expected. The momentum of the argument for the first\nprinciple carries through to the argument for the second principle.\nThose who believe in equal basic liberties, but who reject the other\negalitarian features of justice as fairness, must try to find some\nother route to justifying those basic liberties.\n\nThe original position is also the crux of Rawls\u2019s metaethical\ntheory, political constructivism. Political constructivism is\nRawls\u2019s account of the objectivity and validity of political\njudgments.\n\nThe original position embodies, Rawls says, all of the relevant\nconceptions of person and society, and principles of practical\nreasoning, for making judgments about justice. When there is an\noverlapping consensus focused on justice as fairness, the original\nposition specifies a shared public perspective from which all citizens\ncan reason about the principles of justice and their application to\ntheir society\u2019s institutions. Judgments made from this\nperspective are then objectively correct, in the sense of giving\nreasons to citizens to act regardless of their actual motivations, or\nthe reasons they think they have within their particular points of\nview.\n\nPolitical constructivism does not maintain that the original position\nshows that the principles of justice as fairness are true. Questions\nof truth are ones about which reasonable citizens may disagree, and\nare to be addressed by each citizen from within her own comprehensive\ndoctrine. Judgments made from the original position are, however,\nvalid, or as Rawls says, reasonable.\n5. The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy\n\nWith the theories of legitimacy and justice for a self-contained\nliberal society completed, Rawls then extends his approach to\ninternational relations with the next in his sequence of theories: the\nlaw of peoples.\n\nRawls assumes that no tolerable world state could be stable. He cites\nKant in asserting that a world government would either be a global\ndespotism or beleaguered by groups fighting to gain their political\nindependence. So the law of peoples will be international, not\ncosmopolitan: it will be a foreign policy that guides a liberal\nsociety in its interactions with other societies, both liberal and\nnon-liberal.\n\nRawls describes the main ideas motivating his law of peoples as\nfollows:\n\nTwo main ideas motivate the Law of Peoples. One is that the great\nevils of human history\u2014unjust war and oppression, religious\npersecution and the denial of liberty of conscience, starvation and\npoverty, not to mention genocide and mass murder\u2014follow from\npolitical injustice, with its own cruelties and callousness\u2026\nThe other main idea, obviously connected with the first, is that, once\nthe gravest forms of political injustice are eliminated by following\njust (or at least decent) social policies and establishing just (or at\nleast decent) basic institutions, these great evils will eventually\ndisappear (LP, 6\u20137).\n\n\nThe most important feature of the \u201crealistic utopia\u201d that\nRawls envisages in The Law of Peoples is that the great evils\nof human history no longer occur. The most important condition for\nthis realistic utopia to come about is that all societies are\ninternally well-ordered: that all have just, or at least decent,\ndomestic political institutions.\n5.1 The International Basic Structure and the Principles of the Law of Peoples\n\nMuch of Rawls\u2019s presentation of the law of peoples parallels the\npresentations of political liberalism and justice as fairness. As a\nliberal society has a basic structure of institutions so, Rawls says,\nthere is an international basic structure (LP, 33, 62, 114,\n115, 122, 123). While Rawls does not say that the international basic\nstructure has a pervasive impact on the life chances of individuals,\nthe rules of this basic structure are coercively enforced (for\nexample, Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was coercively\nreversed by a coalition of other countries). The principles that\nshould regulate this international basic structure thus require\njustification. The justification of these principles must accommodate\nthe fact that there is even more pluralism in worldviews among\ncontemporary societies than there is within a single liberal\nsociety.\n\nRawls puts forward eight principles for ordering the international\nbasic structure:\n\nPeoples are free and independent, and their freedom and\nindependence are to be respected by other peoples.\nPeoples are to observe treaties and undertakings.\nPeoples are equal and are parties to the agreements that bind\nthem.\nPeoples are to observe the duty of nonintervention (except to\naddress grave violations of human rights).\nPeoples have a right of self-defense, but no right to instigate\nwar for reasons other than self-defense.\nPeoples are to honor human rights.\nPeoples are to observe certain specified restrictions in the\nconduct of war.\nPeoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under\nunfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent\npolitical and social regime (LP, 37).\n\n\nAll of these principles, with the exception of the last one, are\nfamiliar from contemporary international law (though Rawls\u2019s\nlist of human rights for principles 4 and 6 is shorter than the list\nin international law). Rawls also leaves room for his law of peoples\nto accommodate various organizations that may help societies to\nincrease their political and economic coordination, such as idealized\nversions of a United Nations, a World Trade Organization, and a World\nBank.\n5.2 Peoples: Liberal and Decent\n\nThe actors in Rawls\u2019s international theory are not individuals\n(citizens) but societies (peoples). A people is a group of\nindividuals ruled by a common government, bound together by common\nsympathies, and firmly attached to a common conception of right and\njustice. \u201cPeople\u201d is a moralized concept, and not all\nstates currently on the world map qualify as such.\n\nRawls\u2019s conception of peoples within the law of peoples\nparallels his conception of citizens within justice as fairness.\nPeoples see themselves as free in the sense of being rightfully\npolitically independent; and as equal in regarding themselves as\nequally deserving of recognition and respect. Peoples are reasonable\nin that they will honor fair terms of cooperation with other peoples,\neven at cost to their own interests, given that other peoples will\nalso honor those terms. Reasonable peoples are thus unwilling to try\nto impose their political or social ideals on other reasonable\npeoples. They satisfy the criterion of reciprocity with respect to one\nanother.\n\nRawls describes the fundamental interests of a people as follows:\n\nProtecting its political independence, its territory, and the\nsecurity of its citizens;\nMaintaining its political and social institutions and its civic\nculture;\nSecuring its proper self-respect as a people, which rests on its\ncitizens\u2019 awareness of its history and cultural\naccomplishments.\n\n\nRawls contrasts peoples with states. A state, Rawls says, is\nmoved by the desires to enlarge its territory, or to convert other\nsocieties to its religion, or to enjoy the power of ruling over\nothers, or to increase its relative economic strength. Peoples are not\nstates, and as we will see peoples may treat societies that act like\nstates as international outlaws.\n\nPeoples are of two types, depending on the nature of their domestic\npolitical institutions. Liberal peoples satisfy the\nrequirements of political liberalism: they have legitimate liberal\nconstitutions, and they have governments that are under popular\ncontrol and not driven by large concentration of private economic\npower.\n\nDecent peoples are not internally just from a liberal\nperspective. Their basic institutions do not recognize reasonable\npluralism or embody any interpretation of the liberal ideas of free\nand equal citizens cooperating fairly. The institutions of a decent\nsociety may be organized around a single comprehensive doctrine, such\nas a dominant religion. The political system may not be democratic,\nand women or members of minority religions may be excluded from public\noffice. Nevertheless, decent peoples are well-ordered enough, Rawls\nsays, to merit equal membership in international society.\n\nLike all peoples, decent peoples do not have aggressive foreign\npolicies. Beyond this, Rawls describes one type of decent\nsociety\u2014a decent hierarchical society\u2014to\nillustrate what decency requires.\n\nA decent hierarchical society\u2019s basic structure specifies a\ndecent system of social cooperation. First, it secures a core list of\nhuman rights. Second, its political system takes the\nfundamental interests of all persons into account through a decent\nconsultation hierarchy. This means that the government genuinely\nconsults with the representatives of all social groups, which together\nrepresent all persons in the society, and that the government\njustifies its laws and policies to these groups. The government does\nnot close down protests, and responds to any protests with\nconscientious replies. The government also supports the right of\ncitizens to emigrate.\n\nRawls imagines a decent hierarchical society that he calls\n\u201cKazanistan.\u201d In Kazanistan, Islam is the favored\nreligion, and only Muslims can hold the high office. However\nnon-Muslim religions may be practiced without fear, and believers in\nthem are encouraged to take part in the civic culture of the wider\nsociety. Minorities are not subject to arbitrary discrimination by\nlaw, or treated as inferior by Muslims. Kazanistan would qualify,\nRawls says, as a decent, well-ordered member of the society of\npeoples, entitled to respectful toleration and equal treatment by\nother peoples.\n5.3 International Toleration and Human Rights\n\nLiberal peoples tolerate decent peoples, and indeed treat them as\nequals. Not to do so, Rawls says, would be to fail to express\nsufficient respect for acceptable ways of ordering a society. Liberal\npeoples should recognize the good of national self-determination, and\nlet decent societies decide their futures for themselves. The\ngovernment of a liberal people should not criticize decent peoples for\nfailing to be liberal, or set up incentives for them to become more\nso. Criticism and inducements may cause bitterness and resentment\nwithin decent peoples, and so be counter-productive.\n\nIndeed public reason imposes duties of civility upon the members of\ninternational society, just as it does upon members of a liberal\nsociety. Government officials and candidates for high office should\nexplain their foreign policy positions to other peoples in terms of\nthe principles and values of the law of peoples, and should avoid\nreliance on contentious parochial reasons that all peoples cannot\nreasonably share.\n\nOne major reason that liberal peoples tolerate decent peoples, Rawls\nsays, is that decent peoples secure for all persons within their\nterritory a core list of human rights. These core human rights include\nrights to subsistence, security, personal property, and formal\nequality before the law, as well as freedoms from slavery, protections\nof ethnic groups against genocide, and some measure of liberty of\nconscience (but not, as we have seen, a right to democratic\nparticipation). These core human rights are the minimal conditions\nrequired for persons to be able to engage in social cooperation in any\nreal sense, so any well-ordered society must protect them.\n\nThe role of human rights in the law of peoples is thus to set limits\non international toleration. Any society that guarantees Rawls\u2019s\nlist of human rights is to be immune from coercive intervention from\nother peoples. Societies that violate human rights overstep the limits\nof toleration, and may rightly be subject to economic sanctions or\neven military intervention.\n5.4 The International Original Position\n\nThe international original position parallels the domestic original\nposition of justice as fairness. This original position answers the\nquestion: \u201cWhat terms of cooperation would free and equal\npeoples (liberal and decent) agree to under fair conditions?\u201d\nThe strategy is to build the conception of peoples into the design of\nthis original position, along with restrictions on reasons for\nfavoring basic principles of international law. The strategy, that is,\nis to describe reasonable conditions under which a rational agreement\non principles can be made.\n\nIn the international original position, representatives of each people\nagree on principles for the international basic structure. Each party\nis behind a veil of ignorance, deprived of information about the\npeople they represent, such as the size of its territory and\npopulation, and its relative political and economic strength. Each\nparty tries to do the best they can for the people they represent, in\nterms of the fundamental interests that all peoples have.\n\nRawls claims that the parties in the international original position\nwould favor the eight principles listed above. Starting from a\nbaseline of equality and independence, the parties would see no reason\nto introduce inequalities into the relationships among peoples (beyond\ncertain functional inequalities in the design of cooperative\norganizations, such as richer countries contributing more to an\nidealized United Nations). The parties would reject international\nutilitarian principles, as no people is prepared to accept that it\nshould sacrifice its fundamental interests for the sake of greater\ntotal global utility.\n\nAfter selecting the eight principles of the law of peoples, the\nparties next check that these principles can stably order\ninternational relations over time. Analogously to the domestic case,\nthe parties will see that the principles of the law of peoples affirm\nthe good of peoples, and that peoples will develop trust and\nconfidence in one another as all willingly continue to abide by these\nprinciples. The stability of the international political order will\nthus be stability for the right reasons (and not a mere modus\nvivendi), since each people will affirm the principles as its\nfirst-best option whatever the international balance of power might\nbecome.\n\nRawls also attempts to draw empirical support for his stability\nargument from the literature on the democratic peace. Social\nscientists have found that historically democracies have tended not to\ngo to war with one another. Rawls explains this by saying that liberal\nsocieties are, because of their internal political structures,\nsatisfied. Liberal peoples have no desires for imperial\nglory, territorial expansion, or to convert others to their religion,\nand whatever goods and services they need from other countries they\ncan obtain through trade. Liberal peoples, Rawls says, have no reasons\nto fight aggressive wars, so a genuine peace can endure among them.\nAnd since decent peoples are defined as non-aggressive, any decent\npeople can join this liberal peace as well.\n\nOnce the parties have agreed to the eight principles of the law of\npeoples, they then continue to specify these principles more precisely\nin a process analogous to the domestic four-stage sequence.\n5.5 Non-Ideal Theory: Outlaw States and Burdened Societies\n\nThe principles selected in the international original position contain\nprovisions for non-ideal situations: situations in which nations are\nunwilling to comply with the ideal principles, or are unable to\ncooperate on their terms. These provisions are embedded in principles\n4 through 8 of the law of peoples.\n\nOutlaw states are non-compliant: they threaten the peace by\nattempting to expand their power and influence, or by violating the\nhuman rights of those within their territory. The principles of the\nlaw of peoples allow peoples to fight these outlaw states in\nself-defense, and to take coercive actions against them to stop their\nviolations of human rights. In any military confrontations with outlaw\nstates, peoples must obey the principles of the just prosecution of\nwar, such as avoiding direct attacks on enemy civilians in all but the\nmost desperate circumstances. The aim of war, Rawls says, must be to\nbring all societies to honor the law of peoples, and eventually to\nbecome fully participating members of international society.\n\nBurdened societies struggle with social and economic\nconditions that make it difficult for them to maintain either liberal\nor decent institutions. A burdened society may lack sufficient\nmaterial or social resources to support a scheme of social\ncooperation, perhaps because its population has grown beyond its\nterritory\u2019s means to support it. It is the basic structure and\npolitical culture of a society that are most crucial for its\nself-sufficiency; the international community must help a burdened\nsociety to rise above this threshold. The law of peoples (eighth\nprinciple) requires that burdened peoples be assisted until they can\nhandle their own affairs (i.e., become well-ordered).\n\nThis duty of assistance is Rawls\u2019s greatest divergence from the\nrules of today\u2019s international law. Accepting this duty would\nrequire significant changes in how nations respond to global poverty\nand failed states.\n5.6 Reconciliation and Realistic Utopia\n\nRawls\u2019s vision is of a perpetually peaceful and cooperative\ninternational order, where liberal and decent peoples stand ready to\npacify aggressive states, to secure core human rights, and to help\nstruggling countries until they become self-sufficient.\n\nCompared to other theories, Rawls\u2019s international theory has\nlimited ambitions. Officials of democratic societies can do little\nmore than hope that decent societies will become internally more\ntolerant and democratic. Once the duty to assist burdened peoples is\nsatisfied, there are no further requirements on international economic\ndistributions: for Rawls, international economic inequalities are of\nno political concern as such. Moreover, individuals around the world\nmay suffer greatly from bad luck, and they may be haunted by spiritual\nemptiness. These are not concerns reached by a Rawlsian foreign\npolicy.\n\nThe limited practical goal of Rawls\u2019s law of peoples is the\nelimination of the great evils of human history: unjust war and\noppression, religious persecution and the denial of liberty of\nconscience, starvation and poverty, genocide and mass murder. The\nlimits of this ambition mean that there will be much in the world to\nwhich Rawls\u2019s political philosophy offers no reconciliation.\n\nNevertheless, while Rawls\u2019s vision is limited, it is also\nutopian. To believe that Rawls\u2019s vision is possible is to\nbelieve that individuals are not inevitably selfish or amoral, and\nthat international relations can be more than merely a contest for\ndomination, wealth, and glory. Human life, and human history, need not\nbe merely a Hobbesian \u201cperpetual and restless desire of power\nafter power\u201d (1651, 58). Affirming the possibility of a just and\npeaceful future can inoculate us against a cynicism that undermines\nthe decency, reciprocity, and reasonableness that exist now and that\nmay grow from now on.\n\n\u201cBy showing how the social world may realize the features of a\nrealistic utopia,\u201d Rawls says, \u201cpolitical philosophy\nprovides a long-term goal of political endeavor, and in working toward\nit gives meaning to what we can do today\u201d (LP,\n128).\n6. Further Reading\n\nBeyond the texts by Rawls cited above, readers may wish to consult\nRawls\u2019s lectures on Hume, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel\n(LHMP) and on Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Mill, Marx, Sidgwick, and\nButler (LHPP) to see how Rawls\u2019s interpretations of\nthese authors informed his own theorizing. Reath, Herman, and\nKorsgaard (1997) is a collection of essays by Rawls\u2019s students\non his work in the history of philosophy.\n\nThe scholarly literature on Rawls is vast; below are some entry points\nthat may be useful.\n\nVoice (2011) is a summary and defense of Rawls\u2019s three main\nbooks that is accessible to those with some undergraduate\nphilosophical training. More advanced students wanting a guide to\nA Theory of Justice may wish to read Mandle (2009). Mandle\nand Reidy (2014) is a lexicon with short entries on important\nconcepts, issues, influences, and critics, from Abortion to Maximin to\nWittgenstein.\n\nFreeman (2007) sets out in a single volume the historical development\nof Rawls\u2019s theories, as well as sympathetic elaborations of many\nof his central arguments. Weithman (2011) details the evolution of\nRawls\u2019s thought from A Theory of Justice to\nPolitical Liberalism. Pogge (2007) is an explication of\nRawls\u2019s domestic theories, which also contains a biographical\nsketch and brief replies to libertarian and communitarian critics (for\nwhich see also Pogge (1989)). Maffettone (2011) and Audard (2007) are\ncritical introductions to Rawls\u2019s three major works.\n\nHistorically, the most influential volume of essays on justice as\nfairness has been Daniels (1975). Freeman (2003) is a collection of\narticles on major themes in Rawls\u2019s domestic theories; it also\ncontains an introductory overview of all of Rawls\u2019s work. Brooks\nand Nussbaum (2015) collects articles on Rawls\u2019s political\nliberalism. Older collections on political liberalism include Davion\nand Wolf (1999), Griffin and Solum (1994) and Lloyd (1994). Martin and\nReidy (2006) focuses on the law of peoples. Hinton (2015) is a\ncollection on the original position.\n\nMandle and Reidy (2013) and Reidy (2008) are volumes of scholarly\nessays spanning a wide range of issues arising from Rawls\u2019s\nwork. Young (2016) is a selection of more critical articles. Mandle\nand Roberts-Cady (2020) pairs authors in debates over major issues in\nRawls\u2019s writings.\n\nA debate over Rawls and race is between Mills (2017, chs. 8 and 9) and\nShelby (2004, 2013). Abbey (2013) is a volume on feminist engagements\nwith Rawls\u2019s work. Bailey and Gentile (2014) is an anthology\nthat explore how extensively religious believers can engage in the\npolitical life of a Rawlsian society. Brooks (2012) and Fleming (2004)\nare collections on Rawls and the law. O\u2019Neill and Williamson\n(2012) is on the institutional design of a Rawlsian property-owning\ndemocracy. Edmundson (2017) argues that Rawlsian justice requires\nsocialism.\n\nGalisanka (2019) is an intellectual history leading up to A Theory\nof Justice, that also details Rawls\u2019s experiences in World\nWar II. Gregory (2007) and Nelson (2019, ch. 3) examine Rawls\u2019s\nearly religious writings. Bok (2017) emphasizes the Wittgensteinian\ninfluences on Rawls\u2019s early thought. Botti (2019) situates Rawls\nwithin American pragmatism. Recent historicist treatments of\nRawls\u2019s work include Forrester (2019) and some of the essays in\nSmith, Bejan, and Zimmerman (2021). In this last volume, Terry (2021)\ndiscusses Rawls\u2019s condemnation of the racism of the Vietnam\ndraft.\n\nReaders who can gain access (usually through a library) to Kukathas\n(2003, 4 volumes) or Richardson and Weithman (1999, 5 volumes) will\nfind many of older scholarly articles on Rawls\u2019s work, divided\naccording to specific themes (e.g., maximin reasoning, public reason)\nand types of criticisms (e.g., conservative critiques, feminist\ncritiques).
