Bolzano\u2019s Main Writings\n\nBolzano\u2019s uncommonly versatile work culminated in three\nextensive main writings in three different areas of knowledge: (1) in\ntheology his four volume Textbook of the Science of\nReligion (Bolzano 1834), (2) in philosophy the four\nvolume Theory of Science (Bolzano 1837), which provides a new\nfoundation for logic and is at the same time an extensive manual of\nlogic, and (3) in mathematics the Theory of\nQuantities, conceived of as a monumental work, but not\ncompleted.\n\nBolzano\u2019s teaching was concerned exclusively with fundamental\ntopics of theology; in addition he worked mainly in logic.\nNevertheless, his scientific development began in\nmathematics. Already in 1804 Bolzano\u2019s first scientific\npublication, namely Considerations on Some Objects of Elementary\nGeometry appeared; further mathematical publications followed\nbetween 1810 and 1817. Bolzano returned ultimately to mathematics in\norder to create a new foundation on which mathematics as a whole could\nbe built; he succeeded in doing this, however, only in bits and\npieces. \n",
