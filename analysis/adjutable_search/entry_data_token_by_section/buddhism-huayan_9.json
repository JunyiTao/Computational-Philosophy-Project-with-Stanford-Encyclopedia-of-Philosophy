    "main_text": "Fazang (643\u2013712) || Panjiao\n4.4 Panjiao\n\nThe first nine chapters of Fazang\u2019s Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan provide, in effect, an encyclopedic argument\nfor a panjiao system that positions Fazang\u2019s views as\nsurpassing the limitations of all prior Buddhist traditions, but\nFazang provides no convenient summary. With some minor exceptions, the\nbasic outline follows Zhiyan\u2019s panjiao. \n\nThe first teaching in Fazang\u2019s panjiao\u2014the one he\nranks as conveying the least truth, as being the most limited in its\nskillful means\u2014is what he calls Hinayana (and what we now call\nAbhidharma). Fazang offers three criticisms of this teaching. First,\nhe claims that the Abhidharmic analysis of consciousness is\nincomplete, because it does not provide a thorough analysis of\nrepository consciousness (alayavijnana)\u2014that occurs\nonly with the Yogacara branch of the Mahayana tradition. Second, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic analysis of dharmas is\nincomplete, because no school within the tradition manages to\nestablish a list of dharmas that contains all the\ndharmas contained by all other lists, and because the\ntradition cannot seem to resolve disagreements on the status of\ncertain putative dharmas. Third, and most importantly, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic tradition remains committed to the error\nof Eternalism by virtue of denying that dharmas are empty.\n\n\nThe second teaching in Fazang\u2019s panjiao is what he\ncalls Elementary Teaching of the Mahayana. These are the teachings of\nMadhyamaka and Yogacara, represented by figures such as Nagarjuna and\nVasubandhu in India, and by Jizang and Xuanzang in China. Fazang ranks\nthis teaching as superior to the first because it teaches that\neverything, dharma or not, is empty, and because the Yogacara\ntradition provides a thorough analysis of repository consciousness.\nBut, according to Fazang, the Yogacarin analysis of consciousness is\nerroneous because it mistakes the repository consciousness for some\nsort of ultimate reality. The repository consciousness, according to\nYogacara tradition, contains impurities and defilements. Yet ultimate\nreality, as Fazang understands it, is free of such imperfections. \n\nThe third teaching in Fazang\u2019s panjiao is what he calls\nthe Final Teaching of the Mahayana. Fazang has in mind teachings\nassociated with tathagatagarbha theory, as present in texts\nsuch as Awakening of Faith in Mahayana. According to Fazang,\nthe Final Teaching improves upon the Elementary Teaching by virtue of\ncorrectly understanding ultimate reality as pure and\nundefiled\u2014not as repository consciousness, but as\ntathagatagarbha. The Final Teaching also transcends the\nlimitations of the prior two teachings\u2014each of which focuses on\none of the pair \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cemptiness\u201d to\nthe exclusion of the other\u2014by treating ultimate reality as\nhaving two aspects: an aspect of existing, and an aspect of being\nempty. \n\nThere is a latent tension within tathagatagarbha theory, as\nFazang understands it. This is the tension between conceptualizing\nultimate reality as tathagatagarbha and conceptualizing\ntathagatagarbha as ineffable. This is why Fazang ranks the\nFinal Teaching of the Mahayana as inferior to a fourth teaching, which\nhe calls the Sudden Teaching. This is the teaching of Vimalakirti,\nfrom the Vimalakirti Sutra, who, in responding to a request\nto characterize ultimate reality, answers with silence. This is\nsuperior to the Final Teaching of Mahayana, according to Fazang,\nbecause the only way to succeed at conceptualizing the ultimate nature\nof reality is to refuse to conceptualize in the first place. \n\nThe fifth and final teaching in Fazang\u2019s\npanjiao\u2014the pinnacle of Buddhist teaching, in his\nview\u2014is what he calls the Round Teaching. Here Fazang refers to\nhis own teaching, which he positions as developing the\nteachings of his master, Zhiyan, and which he locates in fetal form\namong the writings of Dushun and amidst the many verses of the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. While the first teaching in Fazang\u2019s\npanjiao focuses on the fabricated nature of reality, and\nwhile the three intermediate teachings focus on the consummate nature\nof reality, Fazang claims that only the Round Teaching accommodates\nall three natures of reality. For, according to the Round Teaching,\neverything is empty, and so the teaching correctly understands the\n\u201cfabricated\u201d nature of what seems to be not-empty; but the\nconsummate nature of ultimate reality is ineffable, and so the\nteaching manages to avoid the limitations of the Elementary and Final\nTeachings of Mahayana. Since, in Fazang\u2019s view, only the Round\nTeaching understands the other-dependent nature of ultimate\nreality\u2014a nature ignored by other Buddhist traditions\u2014he\nconcludes that the Round Teaching, as expressed by his metaphysics, is\nsuperior to all other Buddhist teachings. \n",
