    "main_text": "Zen\u2019s Understanding of Time and Space || The Structure of Things Appearing\n7.4 The Structure of Things Appearing\n\nGiven Zen\u2019s mode of seeing, which is non-dualistic in nature,\noccurring in zero-time and zero-space, one may ask how things appear\nto the Zen mind under these conditions. We can interpret Zen\u2019s\nnondualistic experience epistemologically as that experience which\narises from a nondiscriminatory state of meditational awareness. To be\nmore specific, nondiscriminatory awareness signifies that it is the\nfoundational background, as articulated in the foregoing, that is\nbottomless or nothing, and as such does not participate in\ndiscriminatory activity. However, when a thing appears, a\ndiscrimination occurs on this foundational, though bottomless,\nbackground. Because it occurs on this foundation, it does not distort\nthe shape of things to appear along with its force. We have designated\nits activity as discernment vis-\u00e0-vis nondiscrimination. It may\nalso be characterized as nondiscriminatory discrimination, in order to\ncapture a sense of how things appear in meditational awareness. In\nsuch awareness no ego is posited either as an active or a passive\nagent in constituting the things of experience, as this awareness\nrenders useless the active-passive scheme as an explanatory\nmodel. This awareness lets a thing announce itself as a\nthing. Therefore, it avoids, on one hand, the idealist position,\nincluding Husserl\u2019s intentionality model in which a thetic\nmeaning-bestowing activity is assigned to the act of consciousness. \nOn the other hand, it also rejects the British empiricist\u2019s stance in which\nthe epistemological subject is considered a passive \ntabula rasa upon which attributes are impressed. These\nimplications are suggested because Zen\u2019s\nnondiscriminatory/discriminatory awareness arises out of the state of\nno-ego in which no projection from the unconscious and no\nsuperimposition of intellectual ideas occur in the field of meditative\nawareness. \n\nMoreover, because things are experientially \u201cconstituted\u201d\nin this manner, we can interpret the epistemological structure of\nappearing to be such that things appear in the field of meditative\nawareness without presupposing Gestalt psychology\u2019s distinction\nbetween foreground and background. This is because the ego is turned\ninto nothing in the state of nondiscriminatory discriminatory\nawareness, and hence no-ego, where this nothing is paradoxically a\nbackground that is not the background at all, because it is a\nbottomless background. To use Nishida\u2019s terminology\nagain, the nondiscriminatory/discriminatory awareness is an act of\n\u201cseeing without being a seer.\u201d Or, to use the terminology\nof phenomenology, the bottomless background or the background of\nnothing is the stance in which the noetic act is rendered nothing.\nAccordingly, the noematic object is allowed to announce iteself\nwithout an intentional constitution by the latter. This is the meaning\nof \u201cno projection\u201d and \u201cno superimposition\u201d\nmentioned above. It consequently opens up a bottomless horizon, on\nwhich a noematic object announces itself in toto as a\nphenomenon.\n\nThis opening up simultaneously accompanies, as mentioned in the\nforegoing, a de-substantialization and de-ontologization of the things\nof experience, because there is no act of the ego that substantializes\nand ontologizes them; substantialization and ontologization both arise\nas a consequense of anthropomorphic activity that is intricately tied\nto the discursive mode of reasoning. Consequently, we are led to\nconclude that the things of experience announce themselves in\ntoto without concealing anything behind them. This is because\nthere is nothing in the bottomless background to determine or delimit\nhow things appear. Zen uses such terms as \u201csuchness\u201d or\n\u201cthusness\u201d to designate it. For example, D\u014dgen\ncaptures it by stating in \u201cthe Buddha Nature\u201d fascicle\nthat \u201cnothing is concealed in the universe.\u201d\n\nIn order to see how the above-mentioned structure of appearing\noperates under the conditions of zero-time and zero-space, we must\ncapture a sense of a temporal-spatial awareness reflective of the\nnondualistic experience. We previously discussed zero-time\ntemporalizing and zero-space spatializing in which temporalization is\nspatialization and spatialization is temporalization, as in\nD\u014dgens theory of \u201cbeing-time,\u201d wherein there is no\nformal separation between the two. Hence,\nneither time nor space is conceived to be a container. Rather, they\nare expressions of things \u201cthing-ing\u201d the primordial mode\nof their being. This thing-ing of things springs from zero-time and\nzero-space. One must stand on ground zero to see the\n\u201cthing-ing\u201d of things where there is no temporalization\nand no spatialization of things.\n",
