    "preamble": "\n\nThe term Temporal Logic has been broadly used to cover all\napproaches to reasoning about time and temporal information, as well as their formal representation, within a logical framework, and also more narrowly to refer specifically to the modal-logic type of approach introduced around 1960 by Arthur Prior under the name Tense Logic and subsequently developed further by many logicians and computer\nscientists. Applications of Temporal Logic include its use as a\nformalism for clarifying philosophical issues about time, as a\nframework within which to define the semantics of temporal expressions\nin natural language, as a language for encoding temporal knowledge in\nartificial intelligence, and as a tool for specification, formal\nanalysis, and verification of the executions of computer programs and\nsystems.\n\nHere we provide a broadly representative, yet concise and inevitably\nincomplete, overview of the rich variety of temporal models and logics\nintroduced and studied over the past 50 years.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Temporal reasoning from antiquity to modern days\n\nDiscussions of temporality and reasoning about time go back to\nantiquity, and examples can be found even in the Bible (Boyd 2014).\nZeno\u2019s famous flying arrow paradox refers to the nature of time\nand broaches the corresponding notion of change. Much of the early\ntemporal discussion, however, centered around the problem of\nfuture contingents, that is, the question whether statements\nabout future events that are neither necessary nor impossible can have\ndefinite truth values. The most widely known and probably most cited\nexample is the sea-fight scenario discussed by Aristotle in On\nInterpretation (Chapter 9). Aristotle argued that statements such\nas \u201cThere will be a sea-fight tomorrow\u201d, as well as the\ncontrary prediction \u201cThere will not be a sea-fight\ntomorrow\u201d, do not hold of necessity and hence lack definite\ntruth values at present, while conceding that it is necessary that\neither there will be a sea-fight tomorrow or not. A few decades later,\nthe philosopher Diodorus Chronus demonstrated the problem of future\ncontingents in his famous Master Argument, which led him to\ndefine the possible as \u201cwhat is or will be the case\u201d. A\ndetailed discussion of Diodorus\u2019 argument is provided in e.g.\nRescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVII) and the entry on\n future contingents.\n\nPhilosophical discussions concerning time and the contingent future\ncontinued in the Middle Ages, where the theme was taken up by writers\nsuch as Peter Aureole, William of Ockham, and Luis Molina. In the\ncenter of focus here was the question how to reconcile God\u2019s\nforeknowledge with the idea of human freedom. Ockham, for example,\nembraced the idea of a true or actual future, holding that future\ncontingent statements are either true or false even though only God\nknows their truth values. According to Ockham, this is not to say,\nhowever, that future contingents are necessary, meaning that there are\nalternative possibilities for humans to choose from. Later, several\nphilosophers and logicians engaged in the problem of relating\ntemporality with free will, indeterminism, and the open future,\nproposing various different solutions. C.S. Peirce objected to the\nidea that future contingents can have definite truth values. He\nadvanced the view that only the present and the past are actual\nwhereas the future is the realm of possibility and necessity. In a\nsimilar spirit, J. \u0141ukasiewicz devised a three-valued logic,\ntreating the truth values of future contingent statements as\nundetermined. For a more recent philosophical discussion on free will,\nindeterminism, and the open future, see e.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and\nM\u00fcller (2014).\n\nThe modern era of formal temporal logic was initiated by the seminal\nwork of Arthur N. Prior, with important precursors such as H.\nReichenbach, J. Findlay, J. \u0141ukasiewicz, and J.\n \u0141o\u015b.[1]\n From the early 1950s, Prior introduced and analyzed in detail over\nmore than a decade several different versions of Tense Logic, many of\nwhich are discussed below. Prior\u2019s invention of Tense Logic was\nlargely driven by philosophical considerations. In particular, the\nMaster Argument of Diodorus Chronus and the intricate relationship\nbetween time, (in)determinism, God\u2019s foreknowledge, and human\nfreedom played a pivotal role in his work. Prior was convinced that a\nproper logical approach could help to clarify and solve such\nphilosophical problems. He introduced temporal operators, studied\nmetric tense logic, was a pioneer in hybrid temporal logic, devised\ntwo versions of branching time temporal logic, which he took to reflect the\nviews of Ockham and Peirce, respectively, etc. His work paved the way\nfor the development of the vast and diverse field of temporal logic,\nwith numerous important applications not only in philosophy, but also\nin computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. For\nmore on Prior\u2019s views and work, see Hasle et al. (2017);\nBlackburn et al. (2019); and the entry on\n Arthur Prior.\n A comprehensive overview of the history of temporal reasoning and\nlogics is provided in \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995). See\nalso \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (2006) and Dyke and Bardon\n(2013, Part I).\n2. Formal models of time\n\nThe ontological nature and properties of time give rise to fundamental\nphilosophical questions, which find their expression in the rich\nvariety of formal models of time employed in temporal logics. For\nexample, is time instant-based or interval-based? Is it discrete,\ndense, or continuous? Does time have a beginning or an end? Is it\nlinear, branching, or circular? Before we turn to the formal languages\nof temporal logics and their semantics, we briefly introduce below the\ntwo most basic types of formal models of time together with some of\ntheir pertinent properties: instant-based and interval-based\nmodels.\n2.1 Instant-based models of time\n\nIn instant-based models the primitive temporal entities are points in\ntime, viz. time instants, and the basic relationship between\nthem (besides equality) is temporal precedence. Thus, the\nflow of time is represented by a non-empty set of time instants \\(T\\)\nwith a binary relation \\(\\prec\\) of precedence on it: \\(\\mathcal{T} =\n\\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle.\\)\n\nThere are some basic properties which can naturally be imposed on\ninstant-based flows of time. The temporal precedence relation is\nusually required to be a strict partial ordering, that is, an\nirreflexive, transitive, and hence asymmetric relation. Sometimes,\nhowever, it is assumed to be reflexive, and then the antisymmetry\ncondition is added. The relevant properties are listed below.\n\nOne fundamental distinction in the realm of instant-based models of\ntime is the distinction between linear models, where the flow of time\nis depicted as a line, and backward-linear models, which allow a\ntree-like representation, supporting the view that the past is fixed\n(and hence linear) while the future may be open (branching into\nmultiple possible futures). In either case, the temporal ordering may\nor may not contain minimal or maximal elements, corresponding to first\nor last instants in time, respectively.\n\nAnother important distinction is between discrete models of time, which are prevalent in computer science, and dense or continuous ones, which are more common in natural sciences and\nphilosophy. In forward-discrete\n(backward-discrete) models, each time instant that has a successor\n(predecessor) always has a corresponding immediate successor\n(immediate predecessor). In dense models, by contrast, between any two\nsubsequent time instants, there is another instant.\n\nMany, but not all, possible properties which an instant-based model of\ntime \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\) may have\ncan be expressed by first-order sentences as follows (where\n\\(\\preceq\\) is an abbreviation of \\(x\\prec y \\lor x=y\\)):\n\nreflexivity: \\(\\forall x (x\\prec x);\\)\nirreflexivity: \\(\\forall x\\lnot (x\\prec x);\\)\ntransitivity: \\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z(x\\prec\ny\\wedge y\\prec z\\rightarrow x\\prec z);\\)\nasymmetry: \\(\\forall x\\forall y \\lnot(x\\prec y\\wedge\ny\\prec x);\\)\nanti-symmetry: \\(\\forall x\\forall y(x\\prec y\\wedge y\\prec\nx\\rightarrow x=y);\\)\nlinearity (trichotomy, connectedness): \\(\\forall x\\forall\ny(x=y\\vee x\\prec y\\vee y\\prec x);\\)\nforward-linearity: \\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z(z\\prec\nx\\wedge z\\prec y\\rightarrow (x=y \\vee x \\prec y\\vee y\\prec x));\\)\nbackward-linearity: \\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z(x\\prec\nz\\wedge y\\prec z\\rightarrow (x=y \\vee x \\prec y\\vee y\\prec x));\\)\nbeginning: \\(\\exists x\\lnot\\exists y(y\\prec x);\\)\nend: \\(\\exists x\\lnot\\exists y(x\\prec y);\\)\nno beginning: \\(\\forall x\\exists y(y\\prec x);\\)\nno end (unboundedness): \\(\\forall x\\exists y(x\\prec\ny);\\)\ndensity: \\(\\forall x\\forall y(x\\prec y\\rightarrow \\exists\nz(x\\prec z\\wedge z\\prec y));\\)\nforward-discreteness: \\(\\forall x\\forall y(x\\prec\ny\\rightarrow \\exists z(x\\prec z \\wedge z\\preceq y \\wedge \\lnot\\exists\nu(x\\prec u\\wedge u\\prec z)));\\)\nbackward-discreteness: \\(\\forall x\\forall y(y\\prec\nx\\rightarrow \\exists z(z\\prec x \\wedge y\\preceq z \\wedge \\lnot\\exists\nu(z\\prec u\\wedge u\\prec x))).\\)\n\n\nNote that, in linear models, the two discreteness conditions simplify\nto \n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y(x\\prec y\\rightarrow \\exists z(x\\prec z \\wedge\n\\forall u(x\\prec u \\rightarrow z\\preceq u)))\\) and \n\\(\\forall x\\forall y(y\\prec x\\rightarrow \\exists z(z\\prec x \\wedge\n\\forall u(u\\prec x \\rightarrow u\\preceq z))),\\) respectively.\n\n\nKey examples of properties of instant-based models of time that cannot\nbe expressed by first-order sentences, but require a second-order\nlanguage with quantification over sets, are continuity,\nwell-ordering, and the finite interval property.\nContinuity demands that there be no gaps in the temporal order. Not\nonly must the temporal order be dense, it must also be Dedekind\ncomplete, i.e., every non-empty set of time instants that has an\nupper bound has a least upper bound. An example is the ordered set of\nreal numbers, while a non-example is the ordering of the rational\nnumbers: consider e.g. the set of all rational numbers whose square is\nless than 2. An instant-based model of time is well-ordered if every\nnon-empty, linear set of time instants has a least element, and it has\nthe finite interval property if between any two subsequent time\ninstants there are at most finitely many instants. The natural numbers\nare well-ordered and have the finite interval property, the negative\nintegers are not well-ordered but still have the finite interval\nproperty, and the positive rationals or reals are neither well-ordered\nnor do they have the finite interval property. As we will see in\n Section 3.6,\n these second-order properties can be expressed in propositional\ntemporal languages.\n2.2 Interval-based models of time\n\nInstant-based models of time are often not suitable for reasoning\nabout events with duration, which are better modeled if the underlying\ntemporal ontology uses time intervals, i.e. periods rather\nthan instants, as the primitive entities. The roots of interval-based\ntemporal reasoning can be traced back to Zeno and Aristotle\n(\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995). In an interval-based setting,\nZeno\u2019s famous flying arrow paradox (\u201cIf at each instant\nthe flying arrow stands still, how is movement possible?\u201d) does\nnot arise. Other examples that naturally require interval-based\nreasoning are: \u201cLast night Alice cried a lot while writing the\nletter, and then she calmed down\u201d and \u201cBill was drinking\nhis tea when the postman came\u201d.\n\nInterval-based models usually presuppose linear time. Still, they are\nontologically richer than instant-based models, as there are many more\npossible relationships between time intervals than between time\ninstants. An interval-based model of time can, for instance, include\nthe relations temporal precedence \\(\\prec,\\)\ninclusion \\(\\sqsubseteq,\\) and overlap \\(O\\) over a\nset of time intervals \\(T\\): formally, \\(\\mathcal{T}= \\left\\langle\nT,\\prec,\\sqsubseteq, O \\right\\rangle.\\) Some natural properties of\nsuch interval-based relations and models include: \n\nreflexivity of \\(\\sqsubseteq:\\) \\(\\forall x(x\\sqsubseteq\nx);\\)\nanti-symmetry of \\(\\sqsubseteq:\\) \\(\\forall x\\forall\ny(x\\sqsubseteq y\\wedge y\\sqsubseteq x\\rightarrow x=y);\\)\natomicity of \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) (for discrete time):\n\\(\\forall x\\exists y(y\\sqsubseteq x\\wedge \\forall z(z\\sqsubseteq\ny\\rightarrow z=y));\\)\ndownward monotonicity of \\(\\prec\\) w.r.t.\n\\(\\sqsubseteq:\\) \\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z(x\\prec y\\wedge\nz\\sqsubseteq x\\rightarrow z\\prec y);\\)\nsymmetry of \\(O\\): \\(\\forall x\\forall y(xOy\\rightarrow\nyOx);\\)\noverlapping intervals intersect in a subinterval:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y (xOy \\rightarrow \\exists z( z \\sqsubseteq x \\land\nz \\sqsubseteq y \\land \\forall u ( u \\sqsubseteq x \\land u \\sqsubseteq\ny \\to u \\sqsubseteq z)));\\)\nmonotonicity of \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) w.r.t. \\(O\\): \\(\\forall\nx\\forall y \\forall z(x \\sqsubseteq y \\land xOz \\rightarrow z\n\\sqsubseteq y \\lor zOy).\\)\n\n\nIn an influential early work on the formal study of interval-based\ntemporal ontology and reasoning in AI, Allen (1983) considered the\nfamily of all binary relations that can arise between two intervals in\na linear order, subsequently called Allen relations. These 13\nrelations, displayed in\n Table 1,\n are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, i.e., exactly one of\nthem holds between any given pair of strict intervals (excluding\npoint-intervals). Moreover, they turn out to be definable in terms of\nonly two of them, viz. in terms of \u2018meets\u2019 and\n\u2018met-by\u2019 (Allen 1983).\n\n\n\nInterval relations\nAllen\u2019s notation\n\\(\\textsf{HS}\\) notation\n\n\u2523\u2501\u2501\u252b\nequals \\(\\{=\\}\\)\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2524\u00a0\u2523\u252b\nbefore \\(\\{\\lt\\}\\) / after \\(\\{\\gt\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle L\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{L}\\rangle\\)\nLater\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u254a\u252b\nmeets \\(\\{m\\}\\) / met-by \\(\\{mi\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle A\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{A}\\rangle\\)\nAfter\n\n\u251c\u2500\u254a\u253f\u2501\u252b\noverlaps \\(\\{o\\}\\) / overlapped-by\n\\(\\{oi\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle O\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{O}\\rangle\\)\nOverlaps\n\n\u251c\u2500\u254a\u252b\nfinished-by \\(\\{fi\\}\\) / finishes\n\\(\\{f\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle E\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{E}\\rangle\\)\nEnds\n\n\u251c\u254a\u2549\u2524\ncontains \\(\\{di\\}\\) / during \\(\\{d\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle D\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{D}\\rangle\\)\nDuring\n\n\u2523\u2549\u2500\u2524\nstarted-by \\(\\{si\\}\\) / starts \\(\\{s\\}\\)\n\\(\\langle B\\rangle\\:/\\:\\langle\\overline{B}\\rangle\\)\nBegins\n\n\nTable 1: Allen relations between time\nintervals and the corresponding Halpern-Shoham modal operators (see\n Section 6).\n\n\nGiven an abstract structure defined by a certain set of interval\nrelations of arbitrary arity that are required to satisfy certain\nproperties, the question arises whether it can be represented by means\nof a concrete interval-based model over linear time. Answers are\nprovided by various representation theorems, see e.g. van Benthem\n(1983); Ladkin (1987); and Venema (1990).\n2.3 Instant-based vs. interval-based models of time\n\nThe choice between instants and intervals as the primary objects of\ntemporal ontology has been a highly debated philosophical theme since\nthe times of Zeno and Aristotle. Technically, the two types of\ntemporal ontologies are closely related, and they are reducible to\neach other: on the one hand, time intervals can be defined by pairs of\ntime instants (beginning and end); on the other hand, a time instant\ncan be construed as a degenerate interval, viz. as a point-interval\nwhose beginning and end points coincide.\n\nStill, the technical reductions do not resolve the semantic question\nwhether sentences are to be evaluated with respect to instants or with\nrespect to intervals, and one may argue that both instants and\nintervals are needed as mutually complementary. Two-sorted\npoint-interval models were studied in e.g. Balbiani et al. (2011), and\nmore complex models of time have been investigated as well, including\nmodels of time granularity (Euzenat and Montanari 2005), which allow\nfor different resolution levels of temporal intervals (e.g. minutes,\nhours, days, years, etc.), metric and layered temporal models\n(Montanari 1996), etc.\n\nHere we discuss both instant-based and interval-based temporal logics.\nFor further discussion on the ontological primacy of instants versus\nintervals in temporal logics, see Hamblin (1972); Kamp (1979);\nHumberstone (1979); Galton (1996); as well as van Benthem (1983) for a\ndetailed comparative exploration of both approaches. A more\nphilosophical and historical overview is provided in e.g.\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995; 2006); Dyke and Bardon (2013);\nand Meyer (2013).\n3. Prior\u2019s basic tense logic TL\n\nIn this section, we discuss the language, semantics, and\naxiomatization of the basic tense logic TL introduced by Prior (1957;\n1967; 1968), the founding father of temporal logic. Prior\u2019s\nmotivation for inventing tense logic was largely philosophical, and\nhis ideas were strongly inspired by the use of tense in natural\nlanguage. The innovative feature of Prior\u2019s approach was that he\ntreated propositions as tensed rather than tenseless. Technically,\nthis was achieved by the introduction of temporal operators into the\nlanguage, which were given a modal-logic type of semantics. In view of\nthe pivotal role that tense is playing in his framework, Prior himself\nreferred to his account as Tense Logic, whereas nowadays the\nmore general expression Temporal Logic is prevailing.\n3.1 Prior\u2019s tense operators\n\nThe basic language of Prior\u2019s Tense Logic TL extends the\nstandard propositional language (with atomic propositions and\ntruth-functional connectives) by four temporal operators with intended\nmeaning as follows:\n\n\\(P\\): \u201cIt has at\nsome time been the case that \u2026\u201d\n\\(F\\): \u201cIt will\nat some time be the case that \u2026\u201d\n\\(H\\): \u201cIt has\nalways been the case that \u2026\u201d \n\\(G\\): \u201cIt will\nalways be the case that \u2026\u201d\n\n\nFor example, \u201cIt will always be the case that Prior invented\nTense Logic\u201d translates in TL as \\(GP(\\mathsf{Prior\\ invents\\ TL})\\) and has the formal reading \u201cIt will always be the\ncase that it has at some time been the case that Prior invents Tense\nLogic\u201d.\n\nTL comprises one pair of temporal operators for the past, \\(P\\) and\n\\(H\\), and one pair of temporal operators for the future, \\(F\\) and\n\\(G\\). The operators \\(P\\) and \\(F\\) are often referred to as the\n\u2018weak\u2019 temporal operators, while \\(H\\) and \\(G\\) are known\nas the \u2018strong\u2019 ones. The respective past and future\noperators are duals of each other, i.e., they are interdefinable by\nmeans of the following equivalences: \n\n\\[\nP\\varphi \\equiv \\neg H\\neg \\varphi, H\\varphi \\equiv \\neg P\\neg\n\\varphi \\text{ and } F\\varphi \\equiv \\neg G\\neg \\varphi, G\\varphi \\equiv \\neg\nF\\neg \\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nIn light of these equivalences, the set of formulae of TL can be\nrecursively defined as follows, over a given set of atomic\npropositions \\(PROP\\): \n\n\\[\n\\varphi := p \\in {PROP} \\mid \\bot \\mid \\lnot \\varphi \\mid (\\varphi \\land \\varphi) \\mid\nP\\varphi \\mid F\\varphi.\n\\] \n\n The truth-functional connectives\n\\(\\vee,\\to,\\) and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) are definable in terms of\n\\(\\lnot\\) and \\(\\land\\) as usual. Besides, we can define \\(A\\varphi\n=H\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi \\wedge G\\varphi\\) and, dually, \\(E\\varphi\n=P\\varphi \\vee \\varphi \\vee F\\varphi,\\) which on linear flows of time\nmean \u201calways\u201d and \u201csometime\u201d,\nrespectively.\n\nAs said, Prior\u2019s introduction of the temporal operators was\ninitially motivated by the use of tense in natural language, and\nvarious tenses in natural language can, at least approximately, be\ncaptured in TL. For example:\n\n\\(P\\varphi\\) \ncorresponds to \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) was the case\u201d or\n\u201c\\(\\varphi\\) has been the case\u201d.\n\\(F\\varphi\\) \ncorresponds to \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) will be the\ncase\u201d.\n\\(PP\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) had been the\ncase\u201d.\n\\(FP\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) will have been\nthe case\u201d.\n\\(PF\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) would be the\ncase\u201d or \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) was going to be the\ncase\u201d.\n\n\nHamblin and Prior showed that, in models of linear time, any sequence\nof temporal operators reduces to a sequence of at most two operators.\nIn total, they identified 15 different such combinations \u2014 or\ntenses, as they call them \u2014 that can be expressed in TL\nover linear flows of time (see Prior 1967, Chapter III.5). Even though\nthese combinations seem to surpass the number of verbal tenses in e.g.\nEnglish, there are also temporal properties of natural language that\ncannot be captured in TL: Prior\u2019s temporal operators are, for\ninstance, not very well suited to model distinctions of aspect (e.g.\nthe distinction between \u201cI wrote a letter\u201d and \u201cI\nwas writing a letter\u201d), which are arguably more adequately dealt\nwith in an interval-based framework. For details, see Kuhn and Portner\n(2006) and the entry on\n tense and aspect.\n3.2 Semantics of TL\n\nThe standard semantics of TL is essentially a Kripke-style semantics,\nfamiliar from modal logic. In modal logic, sentences are evaluated\nover so-called Kripke frames consisting of a non-empty set of possible\nworlds and an accessibility relation between them. In temporal logic,\nthe possible worlds are time instants, and the accessibility relation\nhas a concrete interpretation in terms of temporal precedence. In\nother words, sentences are evaluated over instant-based models of time\n\\(\\mathcal{T}=\\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\), hereafter called\ntemporal frames. Note that so far no conditions, like\ntransitivity, irreflexivity, etc., are imposed on the precedence\nrelation \\(\\prec\\).\n\nGiven a set of atomic propositions \\(PROP\\), a temporal model\nfor TL is a triple \\(\\mathcal{M}= \\left\\langle T, \\prec, V\n\\right\\rangle\\) where \\(\\mathcal{T} =\\left\\langle T, \\prec\n\\right\\rangle\\) is a temporal frame and \\(V\\) is a valuation\nassigning to each atomic proposition \\(p\\in{PROP}\\) the set of time\ninstants \\(V(p) \\subseteq T\\) at which \\(p\\) is considered true.\n(Equivalently, the valuation can be given by a function \\(I:\nT\\times{PROP}\\to \\{\\mathit{true},\\mathit{false}\\},\\) which assigns a\ntruth value to each atomic proposition at each time instant in the\ntemporal frame, or by a labeling or state\ndescription \\(L: T \\to \\mathcal{P}({PROP})\\), which assigns to\neach time instant the set of atomic propositions that are considered\ntrue at that instant.)\n\nThe truth of an arbitrary formula \\(\\varphi\\) of TL at a given\ntime instant \\(t\\) in a given temporal model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\)\n(denoted \\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models\\varphi\\)) is then defined inductively\nas follows:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models p\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(t \\in V(p)\\), for\n\\(p \\in {PROP}\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\not\\models \\bot\\) \u00a0 (i.e., it is not the\ncase that \\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models \\bot\\));\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models \\neg\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\not\\models\\varphi\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models \\varphi \\wedge \\psi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models\\varphi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M},t\n\\models\\psi\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models P\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models \\varphi\\) for some time instant \\(t'\\) such\nthat \\(t'\\prec t\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models F\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models \\varphi\\) for some time instant \\(t'\\) such\nthat \\(t\\prec t'\\).\n\nThat is, given a temporal model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), a formula of the form\n\\(P\\varphi\\) is true at an instant \\(t\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is true at\nsome earlier instant \\(t',\\) and \\(F\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t\\) iff\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true at some later instant \\(t'.\\) Consequently, for\nthe duals \\(H\\) and \\(G\\), it holds that \\(H\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t\\)\niff \\(\\varphi\\) is true at all earlier instants \\(t',\\) and\n\\(G\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is true at all later\ninstants \\(t'.\\)\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models H\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models \\varphi\\) for all time instants \\(t'\\) such\nthat \\(t'\\prec t\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models G\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models \\varphi\\) for all time instants \\(t'\\) such\nthat \\(t\\prec t'\\).\n\nNote that, from the point of view of modal logic,\nthere are, formally speaking, two different accessibility relations\ninvolved here: an \u2018earlier-relation\u2019 in the case of the\npast operators and a \u2018later-relation\u2019 in the case of the\nfuture operators. In temporal logic, these two relations are uniformly\ncaptured by a single precedence relation; after all,\n\u2018earlier\u2019 and \u2018later\u2019 are just converses of\neach other (i.e., \\(t\\) is earlier than \\(t'\\) iff \\(t'\\) is later than\n\\(t\\)).\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) of TL is valid in a temporal model\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) (denoted \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi\\)) iff it\nis true at every time instant in that model. Moreover, we say that\n\\(\\varphi\\) is valid in a temporal frame \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)\n(denoted \\(\\mathcal{T} \\models \\varphi\\)) iff it is valid in every\nmodel on that frame. Accordingly, a formula \\(\\varphi\\) is\nvalid (denoted \\(\\models \\varphi\\)) iff it is valid in all\ntemporal frames, i.e. true at all time instants in all temporal\nmodels. A formula \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfiable iff its negation\nis not valid, i.e. if \\(\\varphi\\) is true at some time instant in some\ntemporal model.\n3.3 Standard translation of TL into first-order logic\n\nAs in the case of modal logic, the language and semantics of TL can be\ntranslated into classical first-order logic (see e.g. van Benthem\n1983).\n\nSuppose that the set of atomic propositions of TL is\n\\({PROP}=\\left\\{p_{0},p_{1},...\\right\\}\\), and let \\(L_{1}\\) be a\nfirst-order language with \\(=,\\) a binary predicate symbol \\(R,\\) and\na denumerable set of unary predicate symbols\n\\(\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{0},P_{1},...\\right\\}\\), one for each atomic\nproposition of TL. The standard translation \\(ST\\) of TL into\n\\(L_{1}\\) is defined as follows, where \\(\\theta[y/x]\\) is the result\nof substituting \\(y\\) for all free occurrences of \\(x\\) in\n\\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\(ST(p_{i}) = P_{i}(x);\\)\n\\(ST(\\bot) = \\bot;\\)\n\\(ST(\\lnot\\varphi) = \\lnot ST(\\varphi);\\)\n\\(ST(\\varphi \\land \\psi) = ST(\\varphi)\\land ST(\\psi);\\)\n\\(ST(P\\varphi) = \\exists y(yRx\\wedge ST(\\varphi)[y/x]),\\)\nwhere \\(y\\) is a fresh variable;\n\\(ST(F\\varphi) = \\exists y(xRy\\wedge ST(\\varphi)[y/x]),\\)\nwhere \\(y\\) is a fresh variable.\n\nIt then follows that\n\n\\(ST(H\\varphi) = \\forall y(yRx\\rightarrow ST(\\varphi)[y/x]);\\)\n\\(ST(G\\varphi) = \\forall y(xRy\\rightarrow ST(\\varphi)[y/x]).\\)\n\n\nFor example: \n\\[ST(Gp_{1}\\lor FHp_{2})=\\forall y(xRy\\rightarrow\nP_{1}y)\\lor \\exists y(xRy\\wedge \\forall z(zRy\\rightarrow\nP_{2}z)).\\]\n\n\nNot every first-order formula has a correspondent in TL. Actually,\nwith a little extra care to re-use individual variables, TL can be\ntranslated in the two-variable fragment FO\\(^{2}\\) of first-order\nlogic, which eventually implies decidability of validity in TL (for\nvalidity in FO\\(^{2}\\) is decidable, as shown by Gr\u00e4del and Otto\n1999). For instance, the example above can be re-written as\n\n\\[ST(Gp_{1}\\lor FHp_{2})=\\forall y(xRy\\rightarrow\nP_{1}y)\\lor \\exists y(xRy\\wedge \\forall x(xRy\\rightarrow P_{2}x)).\\]\n\n\nGiven the standard translation, every temporal model\n\\(\\mathcal{M}=\\left\\langle T,\\prec ,V\\right\\rangle\\) can be regarded\nas an \\(L_{1}\\)-model by interpreting \\(R\\) as \\(\\prec\\) and each\n\\(P_{i}\\) as \\(V(p_{i}).\\) Then: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{M},t  \\models \\varphi \\ & \\text{ iff } \\mathcal{M}\\models  ST(\\varphi)[x:=t], \\\\\n\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi \\ & \\text{ iff } \\mathcal{M}\\models \\forall x ST(\\varphi).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus, validity of a formula of TL in a temporal model is a first-order\nproperty. Validity in a temporal frame, on the other hand, turns out to be a\nsecond-order property as it involves quantification over valuations.\nIf we treat the unary predicates from \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) as predicate\nvariables of a second-order language \\(L_{2},\\) every temporal frame\n\\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) can be regarded as an\n\\(L_{2}\\)-model, where the predicate variables represent the valuation\nof the respective atomic propositions. Let \\(\\forall \\overline{P}\\varphi\n\\) denote the universal closure of an \\(L_{2}\\)-formula \\(\\varphi\\) over\nall predicate variables occurring in it. Then: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{T}\\models \\varphi \\ & \\text{ iff }\\mathcal{T}\\models \\forall \\overline{P}\\forall x ST(\\varphi), \\\\\n\\models \\varphi \\ & \\text{ iff }\\models \\forall \\overline{P}\\forall x ST(\\varphi). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe standard translation of TL into first-order logic enables a\nsystematic treatment of various aspects of temporal logic with the\ntools and techniques of classical logic (see e.g. Blackburn et al.\n2006). As we will see in\n Section 3.6,\n however, not all first-order properties of temporal frames are\ndefinable by temporal formulae; and vice versa, not all properties of\ntemporal frames that can be expressed by formulae of TL are\nfirst-order definable. A non-trivial correspondence between temporal\nlogic and first-order logic as alternative languages for describing\nproperties of time emerges.\n3.4 Tense logic, first-order logic, and McTaggart\u2019s time series\n\nThe standard translation discussed in the previous section links the\nsemantics of Prior\u2019s basic tense logic to first-order logic.\nYet, there are crucial differences between the two approaches to\nformalizing the logic of time. In fact, in the early days of temporal\nlogic, Prior\u2019s approach was perceived as a rival to more\nconventional approaches using first-order logic. The rivalry between\ntense logic and first-order logic can be seen as reflecting a\nfundamental distinction concerning the nature of time, namely the\ndistinction between the A-series and the B-series of time introduced\nby McTaggart (1908).\n\nThe A-series essentially amounts to a characterization of time and\ntemporal order in terms of past, present, and future. The B-series, in\ncontrast, is based on the notions \u2018earlier\u2019 and\n\u2018later\u2019. Thus, whereas the A-series presupposes a\ndistinguished present, the B-series involves an overarching, global\nperspective on time. McTaggart argued that the B-series is\ninsufficient because it lacks an appropriate notion of change, and he\nrejected the A-series as inconsistent because what is future now will\nbe past, which, according to him, requires that one and the same time\ninstant has incompatible properties. From this he concluded that time\nis unreal. For a detailed discussion of McTaggart\u2019s account and\nits philosophical relevance, see Ingthorsson (2016) and the entry on\n time.\n\nThere is a close correspondence between the A-series of time and tense\nlogic, on the one hand, and between the B-series and first-order\nlogic, on the other, as was already noted by Prior (1967, Chapter 1)\nhimself. Consider, for example, the sentence \u201cIt is dark, it was\nlight, and it will be light again.\u201d This sentence can be\nformalized in TL as \n\n\\[\\mathsf{dark} \\wedge P(\\mathsf{light}) \\wedge F(\\mathsf{light})\\] \n\nwhile its first-order formulation reads \n\n\\[\\mathsf{dark}(t_1) \\wedge \\exists t_0 (t_0 \\prec t_1 \\wedge \\mathsf{light}(t_0)) \\wedge \\exists t_2 (t_1 \\prec t_2 \\wedge \\mathsf{light}(t_2)).\\] \n\n The TL formula consists of tensed propositions\n(propositions not containing temporal operators are present tensed),\nand it invokes the local perspective of the present. In the\nfirst-order formula, in contrast, propositions are untensed or\ntenseless. Here we are provided with predicates of time instants\nrather than with tenses, and the perspective involved is a global\nperspective from outside of time. Prior felt that not everything that\ncan be expressed in a tensed language can likewise be expressed in a\ntenseless one, his classic example being: \u201cThank goodness,\nthat\u2019s over!\u201d (Prior 1959).\n3.5 Axiomatic system \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\) for TL\n\nLike every formal logical system, temporal logic has two major\naspects: a semantic and a deductive one. In this section, we\npresent a deductive system for validity in TL, viz. the minimal\ntemporal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\). The logic \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\)\nis an axiomatic system, i.e., it is given by a list of axioms and\ninference rules. The system was first studied by Lemmon, following\nearlier axiomatizations proposed by Hamblin and Prior (see Rescher and\nUrquhart 1971, Chapter VI). \n\nThe list of axioms of the minimal temporal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\)\nextends the list of classical propositional logic by the following\nfour axiom schemata:\n\n\\((K_G)\\) \\(G(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow \\psi)\\rightarrow (G\\varphi \\rightarrow G\\psi)\\)\n\n\\((K_H)\\) \\(H(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow \\psi)\\rightarrow (H\\varphi \\rightarrow H\\psi)\\)\n\n(GP) \\(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow GP\\varphi\\) \n(HF) \\(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow HF\\varphi\\) \n\n\nThe first two axiom schemata are the temporal correspondents of the\nso-called K-axiom of modal logic, and hence the terminology\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\). The third and the fourth axiom schemata capture\nthe interaction of the past and future operators. On the formal level,\nthey guarantee that these operators correspond to converse temporal\nrelations, viz. earlier and later, respectively.\n\nThe inference rules comprise, in addition to the classical modus\nponens, two necessitation rules for the temporal\noperators (where \\(\\vdash\\) means, as usual,\n\u201cdeducible\u201d):\n\n(MP) If \\(\\vdash\n\\varphi\\) and \\(\\vdash \\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi,\\) then \\(\\vdash\n\\psi.\\) \n(NEC\\(_G\\)) If \\(\\vdash\n\\varphi,\\) then \\(\\vdash G\\varphi.\\) \n(NEG\\(_H\\)) If \\(\\vdash\n\\varphi,\\) then \\(\\vdash H\\varphi.\\) \n\n\nThe axiomatic system \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\) is sound and complete for\nvalidity in TL: all and only those formulae that are valid in TL can\nbe deduced from the axioms by means of the given inference rules. For\na proof, see e.g. Rescher and Urquhart (1971); Goldblatt (1992); and\nGabbay et al. (1994).\n3.6 Expressing temporal properties in TL and extensions of \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\)\n\nThe minimal temporal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\) captures those\nvalidities of TL that do not depend on any specific assumptions\nconcerning the properties of the temporal precedence relation. Yet,\nmany natural properties of temporal frames can be expressed by\ntemporal formulae, and, taken as additional axioms, these formulae can\nbe used to represent important ontological assumptions about the\nstructure of time.\n\nA temporal formula of TL expresses (defines or\ncorresponds to) a property of temporal frames if the formula\nis valid in all and only those frames that have the property. The most\nimportant correspondences between properties of temporal frames (see\nlist in\n Section 2.1)\n and TL formulae include: \n\n\n(REF)\nany of \\(G\\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi,\\) \\(H\\varphi \\rightarrow\n\\varphi,\\) \\(\\varphi \\rightarrow F\\varphi,\\) or \\(\\varphi \\rightarrow\nP\\varphi\\)\n\n(reflexivity)\n\n(TRAN)\nany of \\(G\\varphi \\rightarrow GG\\varphi,\\) \\(H\\varphi\n\\rightarrow HH\\varphi,\\) \\(FF\\varphi \\rightarrow F\\varphi,\\) or\n\\(PP\\varphi \\rightarrow P\\varphi\\)\n\n(transitivity)\n\n(LIN-F)\n\\(PF\\varphi \\rightarrow (P\\varphi \\vee \\varphi \\vee F\\varphi)\\)\n\n(forward-linearity)\n\n(LIN-P)\n\\(FP\\varphi \\rightarrow (P\\varphi \\vee \\varphi \\vee F\\varphi)\\)\n\n(backward-linearity)\n\n(LIN)\n\\((PF\\varphi \\lor FP\\varphi) \\rightarrow (P\\varphi \\vee \\varphi\n\\vee F\\varphi)\\)\n\n(linearity)\n\n(BEG)\n\\(H\\bot \\vee PH\\bot\\)\n\n(time has a beginning (assuming\nirreflexivity))\n\n(END)\n\\(G\\bot \\vee FG\\bot\\)\n\n(time has an end (assuming\nirreflexivity))\n\n(NOBEG)\n\\(P\\top\\) \u00a0or\u00a0 \\(H\\varphi\\rightarrow P\\varphi\\)\n\n(time has no beginning)\n\n(NOEND)\n\\(F\\top\\) \u00a0or\u00a0 \\(G\\varphi\\rightarrow F\\varphi\\)\n\n(time has no end)\n\n(DENSE)\n any of \\(GG\\varphi \\rightarrow G\\varphi,\\) \\(HH\\varphi\n\\rightarrow H\\varphi,\\) \\(F\\varphi \\rightarrow FF\\varphi,\\) or\n\\(P\\varphi \\rightarrow PP\\varphi\\)\n\n(density)\n\n(DISCR-F)\n \\((F\\top \\wedge \\varphi \\wedge H\\varphi) \\rightarrow\nFH\\varphi\\)\n\n(forward-discreteness (assuming\nlinearity)\n\n(DISCR-P)\n \\((P\\top \\wedge \\varphi \\wedge G\\varphi) \\rightarrow\nPG\\varphi\\)\n\n(backward-discreteness (assuming\nlinearity)\n\n(IND\\(_{G}\\))\n\\(F\\varphi \\wedge G(\\varphi \\rightarrow F\\varphi)\\rightarrow\nGF\\varphi\\)\n\n(forward induction)\n\n(IND\\(_{H}\\))\n\\(P\\varphi \\wedge H(\\varphi\\rightarrow P\\varphi)\\rightarrow\nHP\\varphi\\)\n\n(backward induction)\n\n(COMPL)\n\\(A(H\\varphi \\rightarrow FH\\varphi)\\rightarrow (H\\varphi\n\\rightarrow G\\varphi)\\)\n\n(Dedekind completeness (recall that \\(A\\varphi =\nH\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi \\wedge G\\varphi\\)))\n\n\nAlternatively, Dedekind completeness can be expressed by:\n\\((FG\\lnot\\varphi \\wedge F\\varphi) \\rightarrow F(G\\lnot\\varphi \\wedge\nHF\\varphi)\\).\n\n(WELLORD)\n\\(H(H\\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi)\\rightarrow H\\varphi\\)\n\n(well-ordering with\ntransitivity)\n\n(FIN-INT)\n\\((G(G\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi)\\rightarrow (FG\\varphi\\rightarrow G\\varphi))\\ \\wedge\\) \n\\((H(H\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi)\\rightarrow (PH\\varphi\\rightarrow H\\varphi))\\)\n\n(finite intervals)\n\n\nNote that this formula is equivalent to the conjunction of\n(IND\\(_{G}\\)) and (IND\\(_{H}\\)).\n\n\nThe principle (LIN) combines forward-linearity (LIN-F) and\nbackward-linearity (LIN-P) in a single condition. The resulting\nformula is, however, not sufficient to guarantee the connectedness of\nthe temporal order. In other words, it cannot rule out disjoint linear\ntime lines. It is also worthwhile to note that (IND\\(_{G}\\)) implies\nbackward-discreteness and that (IND\\(_{H}\\)) implies forward-discreteness\nbut not conversely. For instance, a time flow consisting of a copy of\nthe natural numbers followed by a copy of the integers is\nbackward-discrete, but it does not satisfy (IND\\(_{G}\\)).\n\nRecall that the last three properties mentioned above \u2014\nDedekind completeness, well-ordering, and the finite interval property \u2014\nare not definable by first-order sentences, but they can be expressed\nby temporal formulae. On the other hand, some very simple properties\nof temporal frames that are first-order definable, such as\nirreflexivity or anti-symmetry, are not expressible in TL. For more on\ntemporal axioms expressing properties of time and details on such\nresults, see Segerberg (1970); Rescher and Urquhart (1971); Burgess\n(1979); van Benthem (1983; 1995); Goldblatt (1992); and Hodkinson and\nReynolds (2006).\n\nBy extending the list of axioms of \\(\\mathbf{K}_{t}\\) with one or\nseveral of the above principles one can capture the validities of a\nnumber of natural models of time; that is, there are axiomatic\nextensions that are sound and complete for the corresponding classes\nof temporal frames. Some of these extensions were already being\nstudied in the early days of Temporal Logic, and Prior (1967)\ndiscusses various systems obtained by postulating different\ncombination of axioms. \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{K4}_{t} &= \\mathbf{K}_{t} + \\text{(TRAN): all transitive frames.} \\\\\n\\mathbf{S4}_{t} &= \\mathbf{K}_{t} + \\text{(REF) + (TRAN): all partial orderings.} \\\\\n\\mathbf{L}_{t} &=\\mathbf{K}_{t} + \\text{(TRAN) +(LIN): all strict linear orderings.} \\\\\n\\mathbf{N}_{t} &=\\mathbf{L}_{t} + \\text{(NOEND) + (IND\\(_{G}\\)) +\n  (WELLORD): } \\langle \\mathbf{N,\\lt}\\rangle. \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}_{t} &=\\mathbf{L}_{t} + \\text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +\n  (IND\\(_{G}\\)) + (IND\\(_{H}\\)): } \\langle \\mathbf{Z,\\lt}\\rangle. \\\\\n\\mathbf{Q}_{t} &=\\mathbf{L}_{t} + \\text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +\n  (DENSE): } \\left\\langle \\mathbf{Q, \\lt}\\right\\rangle. \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{t} &=\\mathbf{L}_{t} + \\text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +\n  (DENSE) + (COMPL): } \\left\\langle \\mathbf{R, \\lt}\\right\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs these axiomatizations illustrate, the fact that (LIN) does not\nsuffice to guarantee connectedness in the strict sense or the fact\nthat irreflexivity is not definable in TL do not constitute any severe\nlimitations here: connectedness and irreflexivity do not yield any new\nvalidities.\n\nEach of the above logics turns out decidable (i.e. has a\ndecidable set of validities), which is typically shown by proving the\nso-called finite model property (\u201cEvery satisfiable\nformula is satisfiable in a finite model\u201d), in most cases, with\nrespect to non-standard finite models. For detailed proofs of\ncompleteness of variations of these axiomatic systems as well as\nproofs of decidability, see Segerberg (1970); Rescher and Urquhart\n(1971); Burgess (1979); Burgess and Gurevich (1985); Goldblatt (1992);\nand Gabbay et al. (1994).\n4. Extensions of TL over linear time\n\nA very natural class of instant-based models of time is the class of\nlinear models, and soon after Prior\u2019s invention of Tense Logic\nseveral extensions of TL over linear time have been proposed. In this\nsection, we discuss two such extensions of Prior\u2019s basic\ntemporal logic: the extension of TL by a Next Time operator\nover discrete, linear models of time and the introduction of the\noperators Since and Until. These operators also form\nthe basis of the linear time temporal logic LTL, which has widespread\napplications in computer science.\n4.1 Adding the Next Time operator\n\nIn linear, unbounded, forward-discrete temporal models \\(\\mathcal{M}=\n\\left\\langle T,\\prec, V \\right\\rangle,\\) where every instant \\(t\\) has\na unique immediate successor \\(s(t),\\) it is natural to add a new\ntemporal operator \\(X\\) (\u201cNeXt Time\u201d or\n\u201cTomorrow\u201d) with\n semantics:[2]\n \n\n\\[\n \\mathcal{M},t \\models X\\varphi \\text{ iff } \\mathcal{M},s(t) \\models \\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nThat is, \\(X\\varphi\\) is true at a time instant \\(t\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\)\nis true at the immediate successor \\(s(t)\\) of \\(t\\). The Next\nTime operator was already mentioned by Prior (1967, Chapter\nIV.3), but its importance was first fully appreciated in the context\nof LTL.\n\nThe operator \\(X\\) satisfies the K-axiom\n\n(K\\(_{X}\\)) \\(X(\\varphi\n\\to \\psi) \\to (X\\varphi \\to X\\psi);\\) \n\n\nand the functionality axiom\n\n(FUNC) \\(X\\lnot \\varphi\n\\leftrightarrow \\lnot X\\varphi.\\) \n\n\nIt also enables a recursive, fixed point definition of \\(G\\)\n(FP\\(_G\\)), and, on the ordering of the natural numbers, the operators\n\\(X\\) and \\(G\\) satisfy an induction principle (IND). Assuming that\nthe temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) is reflexive, which is a\nstandard assumption in computer science, we get the following\ndefinitions:\n\n(FP\\(_G\\)) \\(G\\varphi\n\\leftrightarrow (\\varphi \\wedge XG\\varphi);\\) \n(IND) \\(\\varphi \\wedge\nG(\\varphi \\rightarrow X\\varphi )\\rightarrow G\\varphi.\\) \n\n\nIn the language with \\(G,H,\\) and \\(X\\):\n\n\\(\\mathbf{L}_{t}(X) = \\mathbf{L}_{t}\\) + K\\(_{X}\\) + FUNC + FP\\(_{G}\\)\n\naxiomatizes completely the temporal logic of linear, unbounded,\nforward-discrete orderings, while \n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}_{t}(X) = \\mathbf{N}_{t}\\) + K\\(_{X}\\) + FUNC + FP\\(_{G}\n\\) + IND\n\naxiomatizes completely the temporal logic of \\(\\left\\langle\n\\mathbf{N},s,\\leq \\right\\rangle,\\) where \\(s(n) = n+1.\\)\n\nA past analogue of \\(X\\), usually denoted \\(Y\\)\n(\u201cYesterday\u201d), can be defined and axiomatized\nlikewise. For more detail, see Goldblatt (1992) and Andr\u00e9ka et\nal. (1995).\n4.2 Adding Since and Until\n\nPerhaps the most important extension of Prior\u2019s basic tense\nlogic TL was the introduction of the binary temporal operators \\(S\\)\n(\u201cSince\u201d) and \\(U\\)\n(\u201cUntil\u201d) by Hans Kamp in his doctoral\ndissertation (Kamp 1968). The intuitive meanings of these\n are[3]\n\n\\(\\varphi S\\psi\\) \u201c\\(\\varphi\\)\nhas been the case since a time when\n\\(\\psi\\) was the case.\u201d \n\\(\\varphi U\\psi\\) \u201c\\(\\varphi\\)\nwill be the case until a time when\n\\(\\psi\\) is the case.\u201d \n\n\nFor instance, the sentence \u201cI will keep trying until I\nsucceed\u201d can be formalized as: \\(\\mathsf{try}\\,\nU\\,\\mathsf{succeed}.\\) As another example, \u201cEver since Mia left\nhome, Joe has been unhappy and has been drinking until losing\nconsciousness\u201d can be formalized using Since and\nUntil as: \n\n\\[ \n(\\mathsf{Joe\\ unhappy} \\land (\\mathsf{Joe\\ drinks}\\ U\\ \\lnot(\\mathsf{Joe\\\nconscious})))\\ S\\ (\\mathsf{Mia\\ leaves}).\n\\]\n\n\nThe formal semantics of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\) in a temporal model\n\\(\\mathcal{M} = \\langle M,\\prec,V\\rangle\\) is given by the following\ntwo clauses: \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll} \\mathcal{M},t\\vDash \\varphi S\\psi\\quad \\text{ iff }\n&\\mathcal{M},s\\vDash \\psi \\text{ for some } s \\text{ such that }\ns\\prec t \\\\ & \\text{ and } \\mathcal{M},u\\vDash \\varphi \\text{\nfor every } u \\text{ such that } s\\prec u\\prec t;  \\\\\n\n\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash \\varphi U\\psi \\quad \\text{ iff }\n&\\mathcal{M},s\\vDash \\psi \\text{ for some } s \\text{ such that } \nt\\prec s \\\\ & \\text{ and } \\mathcal{M},u\\vDash \\varphi\n\\text{ for every } u \\text{ such that } t\\prec u\\prec s.\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nThese are the \u2018strict\u2019 versions of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\)\nprevalent in philosophy. In computer science, usually reflexive\nversions of the semantics clauses are considered.\n\nPrior\u2019s temporal operators \\(P\\) and \\(F\\) are definable in\nterms of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\): \n\n\\[\nP\\varphi :=\\top S\\varphi \\ \\text{ and } \\ F\\varphi :=\\top\nU\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nOn irreflexive, forward-discrete, linear temporal orders, \\(S\\) and\n\\(U\\) also allow for a definition of the Next Time operator\n\\(X\\): \n\n\\[\nX\\varphi := \\bot U \\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nNote that this definition fails on reflexive temporal orders, which\nshows that the irreflexive versions of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\) are more\nexpressive than their reflexive\n counterparts.[4]\n Other natural operators can be defined in terms of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\) as\nwell, such as for instance Before, given by \\(\\varphi B\\psi\n:=\\lnot ((\\lnot \\varphi)U\\psi)\\) with intuitive reading \u201cIf\n\\(\\psi\\) will be the case in the future, \\(\\varphi\\) will occur before\n\\(\\psi\\)\u201d.\n\nKamp (1968) proved the following remarkable result concerning the\nexpressive power of temporal languages with Since and\nUntil: \n\nEvery temporal operator on a class of continuous, strict linear\norderings that is definable in first-order logic is expressible in\nterms of \\(S\\) and \\(U\\).\n\nStavi later proposed two more operators, \\(S^{\\prime}\\) and\n\\(U^{\\prime},\\) which, when added to \\(S\\) and \\(U\\), make the\ntemporal language expressively complete on all linear frames.\nYet, as shown by Gabbay, no finite number of new operators can make\nthe temporal language functionally complete on all partial\norderings. See Gabbay et al. (1994) for an overview of these\nresults.\n\nBurgess (1982a) provided a complete axiomatic system of the\nSince-Until logic on the class of all linear orderings with reflexive\nprecedence relation, which was further simplified by Xu (1988).\nExtensions of this axiomatization for strict linear orderings were\nobtained by Venema (1993) and Reynolds (1994; 1996). For details and\nrelated results see Burgess (1984); Zanardo (1991); Gabbay et al. (1994); Finger et\nal. (2002); and Hodkinson and Reynolds (2006). The Burgess-Xu\naxiomatic system and some of its extensions are presented \nin the supplementary document:\n\nBurgess-Xu Axiomatic System for Since and Until and Some Extensions\n\n4.3 The linear time temporal logic LTL\n\nThe most popular and widely used temporal logic in computer science is\nthe linear time temporal logic LTL, which was proposed in the seminal\npaper Pnueli (1977), and it was first explicitly axiomatized and\nstudied in Gabbay et al. (1980). In LTL, time is conceived of as a\nlinear, discrete succession of time instants, and the language\ninvolves the operators \\(G,\\) \\(X\\), and \\(U\\) (no past operators).\nLTL is interpreted over \\(\\left\\langle \\mathbf{N},\\leq\\right\\rangle,\\)\nwhere the temporal ordering is assumed to be reflexive as is common in\ncomputer science.\n\nThe logic LTL is very useful for expressing properties of infinite\ncomputations in reactive systems, such as safety, liveness, and\nfairness, as laid out in\n Section 11.1.\n For example, the specification \u201cEvery time when a message is\nsent, an acknowledgment of receipt will eventually be returned, and\nthe message will not be marked \u2018sent\u2019 before an\nacknowledgment of receipt is returned\u201d can be formalized in LTL\nas: \n\n\\[\n G(\\mathsf{Sent} \\to (\\lnot \\mathsf{MarkedSent} \\ U\\ \\mathsf{AckReturned})).\n\\]\n\n\nThe axiomatic system for LTL extends classical propositional logic by\nthe K-axiom for \\(G\\), the K-axiom and the functionality axioms for\n\\(X\\), as well as by axioms providing fixed point characterizations of\nthe reflexive versions of \\(G\\) and \\(U\\): \n\n(K\\(_G\\)) \\(G(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow \\psi)\\rightarrow (G\\varphi \\rightarrow G\\psi)\\)\n\n(K\\(_X\\)) \\(X(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow \\psi)\\rightarrow (X\\varphi \\rightarrow X\\psi)\\)\n\n(FUNC) \\(X\\lnot \\varphi\n\\leftrightarrow \\lnot X\\varphi\\) \n(FP\\(_G\\)) \\(G\\varphi\n\\leftrightarrow (\\varphi \\wedge XG\\varphi)\\) \n(GFP\\(_G\\)) \\(\\psi\n\\land G(\\psi \\rightarrow (\\varphi \\land X\\psi)) \\rightarrow G\\varphi\\)\n\n(FP\\(_U\\)) \\(\\varphi\nU\\psi \\leftrightarrow (\\psi \\vee (\\varphi \\wedge X(\\varphi U\\psi)))\\)\n\n(LFP\\(_U\\)) \\(G((\\psi\n\\vee (\\varphi \\wedge X\\theta))\\rightarrow \\theta)\\rightarrow (\\varphi\nU\\psi \\rightarrow \\theta)\\) \n\n\nThe inference rules involve only the classical modus ponens\nand the necessitation rule for \\(G\\). In technical terms, the axiom\n(FP\\(_{G}\\)) says that \\(G\\varphi\\) is a fixed point of the\noperator \\(\\Gamma_{G}\\) defined by \\(\\Gamma_{G} (\\theta) = \\varphi\n\\land X\\theta,\\) whereas (GFP\\(_{G}\\)) says that \\(G\\varphi\\) is\n(set-theoretically, in terms of its extensions) a greatest\npost-fixed point of \\(\\Gamma_{G}.\\) Likewise, the axiom\n(FP\\(_{U}\\)) says that \\(\\varphi U\\psi\\) is a fixed point of\nthe operator \\(\\Gamma_{U}\\) defined by \\(\\Gamma_{U}(\\theta) = \\psi\n\\lor (\\varphi \\land X\\theta),\\) whereas (LFP\\(_{U}\\)) says that\n\\(\\varphi U\\psi\\) is a least pre-fixed point of\n\\(\\Gamma_{U}\\). Some variations of this axiomatic system are \npresented in the supplementary document:\n\nSome Variations of the Axiomatic System for LTL\n\n\nEarly studies of temporal logics for linear time are presented in\nRescher and Urquhart (1971) and McArthur (1976). Proofs of\ncompleteness of variations of the axiomatic system given above can be\nfound in Gabbay et al. (1980; 1994); Goldblatt (1992); and Finger et\nal. (2002). All logics mentioned in this section have the finite model\nproperty (usually, with respect to non-standard models) and therefore\nare decidable. For proofs of decidability, see the references on\ncompleteness.\n5. Branching time temporal logics\n\nMuch of Prior\u2019s work on Tense Logic was initially motivated by\nthe problems concerning the relationship between time and modality\nraised by the Master Argument of Diodorus Chronus and its fatalistic\nconclusion. Prior held a genuine interest in themes like indeterminism\nand the open future. One of his major concerns here was to allow for\nhuman freedom. In order to capture the notion of historical necessity\nunderlying Diodorus\u2019 argument, he opted for a branching\nrepresentation of the interrelation of time and modality, which was\nfirst suggested to him in a letter by Kripke in 1958 (see Ploug and\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2012). The Diodorean conception of modality as\nquantification over linear time was abandoned and replaced by the\npicture of a tree, whose branches depict alternative possibilities for\nthe future. Prior (1967, Chapter 7) considered two different versions\nof branching time temporal logic, which he associated with the\nhistorical views of Peirce and Ockham, respectively. An early formal\ntreatment of these ideas is provided in Thomason (1970; 1984) and\nBurgess (1978). Many technical results and further developments have\nbeen proposed since then, and we mention the most important ones\nbelow. For Prior\u2019s motivational views on indeterminism and human\nfreedom, see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995, Chapters 2.6 and\n3.2) and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2019). A detailed discussion of the\nphilosophical aspects of the theory of branching time is contained in\ne.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and Correia and Iacona (2013).\n5.1 Prior\u2019s theory of branching time\n\nThe picture that is at the core of Prior\u2019s theory of branching\ntime is reminiscent of the one evoked by Borges\u2019 The Garden\nof Forking Paths. The interrelation of time and modality is\nrepresented as a tree of alternative histories that is linear towards\nthe past and branches into multiple possible futures.\nBackward-linearity captures the idea that the past is fixed;\nforward-branching reflects the openness of the future. At each point\nin time, there may be more than one path leading towards the future,\nand each such path represents a future possibility.\n\nFormally, a tree (or branching time structure) is a\ntemporal frame \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\)\nwhere the temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) is a backward-linear\npartial ordering on the set of time instants \\(T\\) which is such that\nany two instants have a common \\(\\prec\\)-predecessor in \\(T\\). That\nis, every time instant in a tree has a linearly ordered set of\n\\(\\prec\\)-predecessors, and any two instants share some common past. The\nformer condition rules out backward-branching, while the latter\nensures \u2018historical connectedness\u2019. In the philosophical\nliterature, the temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) is commonly\nassumed to be irreflexive, i.e. a strict partial order, whereas in\ncomputer science, usually reflexive structures are studied.\n\nA tree \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\) depicts\nalternative, mutually incompatible possibilities for the future in a\nunified structure, and it can be carved up into multiple histories. A\nhistory in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is a maximal (i.e. non-extendable)\nset of time instants that is linearly ordered by \\(\\prec\\), that is,\nan entire path through the tree; and it represents a complete possible\ncourse of events. We denote the set of all histories in\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) by \\(\\mathcal{H}(\\mathcal{T})\\), and we use\n\\(\\mathcal{H}(t)\\) for the set of histories passing through a given\ntime instant \\(t\\) in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). \n\nSome philosophers have criticized the label \u2018branching\ntime\u2019 as a misnomer, arguing that time does not branch but\nrather evolves linearly. Early criticism along these lines is found in\nRescher and Urquhart (1971), and a similar point is raised in Belnap\net al. (2001), who suggest the label \u2018branching histories\u2019\ninstead. This criticism also casts doubt on the appropriateness of the\nterminology \u2018time instants\u2019 used here to refer to the\nprimitive points of the tree. We stick to the terminology for reasons\nof uniformity. In the branching time literature, the more neutral\nexpression \u2018moments\u2019 is prevailing, and in Belnap et al.\n(2001) the distinction between instants of time and moments is\nformally worked out: branching time structures are associated with a\nlinearly ordered set of time instants, where an instant is defined as\nthe set of contemporaneous moments contained in different\nhistories.\n5.2 The Peircean branching time temporal logic\n\nPrior\u2019s basic tense logic TL is neutral about the structure of\ntime. In a branching time setting with alternative future\npossibilities, the original semantics of the future operator \\(F\\) is,\nhowever, no longer adequate to capture future truth. In such a\nsetting, the future operator \\(F\\) merely reads \u201cit will\npossibly be the case that \\(\\dots\\)\u201d. Prior (1967, Chapter 7)\ntherefore considered two alternative semantics for the future operator\nin branching time, which give rise to the Peircean and Ockhamist\nbranching time temporal logics, respectively.\n\nIn the Peircean branching time logic PBTL, the intuitive meaning of\nthe future operator \\(F\\) is \u201cit will necessarily be the case\nthat \\(\\dots\\)\u201d. That is, future truth is conceived of as truth\nin all possible futures. On this new reading, the future\noperator \\(F\\) is no longer dual to the strong future operator \\(G\\),\nwhich now needs to be included as an additional primitive operator\ninto the language. Given a set of atomic propositions \\({PROP}\\), the\nset of formulae of PBTL can be recursively defined as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\varphi := p \\in {PROP}\\mid \\bot \\mid \\neg \\varphi\\mid (\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi) \\mid P \\varphi \\mid F\\varphi \\mid G \\varphi. \n\\]\n\n\nFormulae of PBTL are evaluated in a temporal model \\(\\mathcal{M} =\n\\langle T,\\prec,V\\rangle\\) on a tree \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle\nT,\\prec\\rangle\\), called a Peircean tree model. As usual,\n\\(V\\) is a valuation that assigns to every atomic proposition \\(p \\in\n{PROP}\\) the set of time instants \\(V(p) \\subseteq T\\) at which \\(p\\)\nis considered true, and the truth of an arbitrary formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) of PBTL at a given time instant \\(t\\) in a Peircean tree\nmodel \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is defined inductively. The semantic\nclauses for the truth-functional connectives and for the past operator\n\\(P\\) (and its dual \\(H\\)) are as in TL (see\n Section 3.2),\n and we only provide here the semantic clauses for the future\noperators \\(F\\) and \\(G\\): \n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll} \\mathcal{M},t\\vDash F\\varphi \\quad \\text{ iff }\n& \\text{for all histories } h\\in \\mathcal{H}(t)\\text{, there is some time }  \\\\ & \\text{instant } t'\\in h \\text{ such that } t\\prec t' \\text{ and } \\mathcal{M},t'\\vDash \\varphi;  \\\\\n\n\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash G\\varphi \\quad \\text{ iff }\n& \\text{for all histories } h\\in \\mathcal{H}(t) \\text{ and for all time instants } \\\\ & t'\\in h \\text{ such that } t\\prec t', \\mathcal{M},t'\\vDash \\varphi.\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nThus, according to the Peircean semantics, a formula of the form\n\\(F\\varphi\\) is true at an instant \\(t\\) iff every history passing\nthrough \\(t\\) contains some later instant \\(t'\\) at which \\(\\varphi\\)\nis true. The strong future operator \\(G\\) essentially retains its\noriginal semantics but now reads \u201cit will necessarily always be\nthe case that \\(\\dots\\)\u201d. Note that in this case the universal\nquantification over histories is redundant and can be omitted without\nloss of meaning. The dual of \\(G\\) is the weak future operator of TL,\nwhich is now denoted by \\(f\\), while the dual of the Peircean \\(F\\) is\ncommonly written \\(g\\) (cf. Burgess 1980). All future operators\ninvolve (implicitly or explicitly) quantification over histories and\nare modalized: they capture possibility and necessity regarding the\nfuture. There is no actual future and, accordingly, no notion of plain\nfuture truth. As this accords well with the view held by Peirce, Prior\ncalled this system \u2018Peircean\u2019.\n\nNote that in the Peircean temporal logic, the formula \\(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow HF\\varphi\\) is no longer valid, which blocks the Master\nArgument of Diodorus Chronus: what is the case now need not have been\nnecessary in the past. Moreover, while Peirceanism preserves bivalence\nand the principle of excluded middle \\(\\varphi \\vee \\neg\\varphi\\), it\nrenders all formulae expressing future contingents false and hence\ninvalidates the principle of future excluded middle \\(F\\varphi \\vee\nF\\neg\\varphi\\). This principle states that eventually either\n\\(\\varphi\\) or \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) will be the case and is usually judged\nintuitively valid (see e.g. Thomason 1970).\n\nA complete finite axiomatization of the Peircean branching time temporal logic\nwas given by Burgess (1980), using a version of the so-called Gabbay\nIrreflexivity Rule. Zanardo (1990) provides an alternative\naxiomatization, where the Gabbay Irreflexivity Rule is replaced by an\ninfinite list of axioms.\n5.3 The Ockhamist branching time temporal logic\n\nWhile Prior himself favored Peirceanism, the Ockhamist branching time\ntemporal logic, which he developed as a possible alternative, has been\ngaining much more influence in the literature on branching time. In\nthe Ockhamist branching time logic OBTL, truth is not only relativized\nto a time instant in the tree but also to a history passing through\nthat instant, and the future operator \\(F\\) is now evaluated along the\ngiven history. Thus, the intuitive meaning of \\(F\\) becomes\n\u201cWith respect to the given history, it will be the case\nthat \\(\\dots\\)\u201d. In addition to the temporal operators \\(F\\) and\n\\(P\\), the language of OBTL contains a modal operator \\(\\Diamond\\) and\nits dual \\(\\Box\\), which are interpreted as quantifiers over\nhistories. Given a set of atomic propositions \\({PROP}\\), the set of\nformulae of OBTL can be recursively defined by \n\n\\[\n\\varphi := p \\in {PROP}\\mid \\bot \\mid \\neg \\varphi\\mid (\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi) \\mid P\\varphi \\mid F\\varphi \\mid \\Diamond\\varphi. \n\\]\n\n\nIn the Ockhamist semantics, formulae are interpreted in a model on a\ntree \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) at pairs \\((t,h)\\)\nconsisting of a time instant \\(t\\in T\\) and a history \\(h \\in\n\\mathcal{H}(t)\\) containing that instant. Sometimes the\ninstant-history pairs \\((t,h)\\) are conceived of as \u2018initial\nbranches\u2019 that start at the instant \\(t\\) and span the possible\nfuture specified by the history \\(h\\) (see e.g. Zanardo 1996).\n\nNaturally, the question arises how to evaluate the atomic propositions\nin the model: do the truth values of atomic propositions depend only\non the time instant, or do they depend on the history as well? The\nanswer to this question crucially hinges on whether atomic\npropositions may contain \u2018traces of futurity\u2019 or not\n(Prior 1967, 124). There is no consensus on the treatment of atomic\npropositions in the literature (cf. Zanardo 1996), and Prior himself\nentertained the idea of a two-sorted language with two different kinds\nof atomic propositions that each require a different treatment (Prior\n1967, Chapter 7.4). Here we will allow the truth values of atomic\npropositions to depend on both the time instant and the history. The\nmore specific case of instant-based propositions can be obtained by\nimposing the additional requirement that the formula \\(p\n\\leftrightarrow \\Box p\\) be valid for \\(p \\in {PROP}\\).\n\nThus, an Ockhamist tree model is a triple \\(\\mathcal{M} =\n\\left\\langle T, \\prec, V \\right\\rangle\\) where \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle\nT,\\prec\\rangle\\) is a tree and \\(V\\) is a valuation that assigns to\nevery atomic proposition \\(p\\in {PROP}\\) the set of instant-history\npairs \\(V(p) \\subseteq T \\times \\mathcal{H}(\\mathcal{T})\\) at which\n\\(p\\) is considered true. The truth of an arbitrary formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) of OBTL at an instant-history pair \\((t,h)\\) in an\nOckhamist tree model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is defined inductively as\nfollows:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\\vDash p\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\((t,h)\\in V(p)\\), for \\(p\\in\n{PROP}\\); \n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\\not\\vDash \\bot\\); \n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h \\vDash \\neg\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\n\\not\\vDash \\varphi\\); \n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h \\vDash \\varphi \\wedge \\psi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h \\models \\varphi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M},t,h \\vDash\n\\psi\\); \n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\\vDash P\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},t',h\\vDash\n\\varphi\\) for some time instant \\(t'\\in h\\) such that \\(t' \\prec t\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\\vDash F\\phi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},t',h\\models\n\\phi\\) for some time instant \\(t'\\in h\\) such that \\(t \\prec t'\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h\\vDash \\Diamond \\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t,h'\\vDash \\varphi\\) for some history \\(h'\\in\n\\mathcal{H}(t)\\). \n\n\nThe temporal operators are essentially interpreted as they are in\nlinear temporal logic: the instant of evaluation is simply shifted\nbackwards and forwards on the given history. Note that the requirement\n\u201c\\(t'\\in h\\)\u201d is redundant in the semantic clause for the\npast operator \\(P\\) as there is no backward branching. It is crucial,\nhowever, in the clause for the future operator \\(F\\). As usual, the\nstrong temporal operators \\(H\\) and \\(G\\) are defined as the duals of\n\\(P\\) and \\(F\\), respectively. The modal operators quantify over the\nset of histories passing through the current instant. The operator\n\\(\\Diamond\\) is an existential quantifier over that set and captures\npossibility, while its dual \\(\\Box\\) involves universal quantification\nand expresses \u2018inevitability\u2019 or \u2018historical\nnecessity\u2019.\n\nWe say that a formula of OBTL is Ockhamist valid iff it is\ntrue at all instant-history pairs in all Ockhamist tree models.\nObviously, all temporal formulae that are valid in linear models of\ntime are Ockhamist valid as well. Hence, Ockhamism validates the principle of\nfuture excluded middle \\(F\\varphi \\vee F \\neg\\varphi\\) (under the\nassumption that time does not end) as well as the formula \\(\\varphi\n\\rightarrow HF\\varphi\\). It invalidates, however, the principle of the\nnecessity of the past \\(P\\varphi \\rightarrow \\Box P\\varphi\\), and it\nthereby blocks Diodorus\u2019 Master Argument. \n\nWhereas in the Peircean branching time logic PBTL future truth is\nmodalized, in the Ockhamist branching time logic OBTL future truth and\nmodality come apart. The Peircean formulae \\(F\\varphi\\) and\n\\(G\\varphi\\) are equivalent to the Ockhamist \\(\\Box F\\varphi\\) and\n\\(\\Box G\\varphi\\), respectively. In fact, PBTL can be regarded as a\nproper fragment of OBTL, namely the fragment that comprises all and\nonly those formulae that are recursively built up from (instant-based)\natomic propositions using truth-functional connectives and the\ncombined modalities \\(\\Box F\\), \\(\\Box G\\), and their duals \\(\\Diamond\nF\\) and \\(\\Diamond G\\). However, the Peircean language is less\nexpressive than the Ockhamist one, lacking e.g. an equivalent for\n\\(\\Diamond GF\\varphi\\) (for a proof, see Reynolds 2002).\n\nBy relativizing truth at an instant to a history in the tree, the\nOckhamist branching time logic provides a notion of plain future\ntruth. From a philosophical point of view, however, the relativization\nto a history is not entirely unproblematic. There are essentially two\ndifferent ways to interpret the Ockhamist history parameter: first,\none may think of the history parameter as referring to the actual\ncourse of events in the tree of possibilities and, since this idea\nmeshes well with Ockham\u2019s view on the future, Prior chose the\nlabel \u2018Ockhamism\u2019. The actualist position has triggered a\nvariety of branching time temporal logics, which are often summarized under the\nlabel \u2018Thin Red Line\u2019 theories (for a discussion, see\nBelnap and Green 1994; Belnap et al. 2001; and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m\n2009). Second, one may think of the history parameter as an auxiliary\nparameter of truth that cannot be initialized in a context: a context of utterance, one may argue, uniquely determines the time instant of the utterance, but it does not and cannot single out one of the histories passing through that instant if the future is genuinely open. This line\nof thought has given rise to \u2018post-semantic\u2019 accounts,\nwhich aim to bridge the gap between the recursive semantic machinery\nand a context by introducing a notion of super-truth, most\nnotably Thomason\u2019s supervaluationism (Thomason 1970) and\nMacFarlane\u2019s assessment-sensitive post-semantics (MacFarlane\n2003; 2014). These accounts sacrifice bivalence, but they preserve the\nprinciples of excluded middle \\(\\varphi \\vee \\neg\\varphi\\) and\nfuture excluded middle \\(F\\varphi \\vee F\\neg\\varphi\\).\n\nFrom a logical point of view, the Ockhamist approach to branching time\nbears a strong resemblance to the idea underlying the notion of a\n\\(T\\times W\\) frame and the more general notion of a Kamp\nframe, discussed in Thomason (1984); the latter is technically\nequivalent to the notion of an Ockhamist frame introduced in\nZanardo (1996). These kinds of frames build on a set of distinct\npossible worlds, each of which is endowed with an internal linear\ntemporal structural, and assume a time-relative, historical\naccessibility relation between possible worlds. That is, overlap of\nhistories is replaced by accessibility, and possible worlds are\nconsidered primitive elements whereas in branching time histories are\ndefined in terms of instants. As a consequence, if we merge a frame\nconsisting of historically related possible worlds into a single tree\n(replacing accessibility by identity), new histories may emerge that\ndo not correspond to any of the possible worlds (for the construction,\nsee e.g. Reynolds 2002).\n\nTechnically, the difference between a possible worlds based approach\nand a branching time based approach can be overcome by equipping\nbranching time structures with a primitive set of histories that is\nrich enough to cover the entire structure, a so-called\nbundle. A bundle tree is defined as a triple\n\\(\\langle T,\\prec,\\mathcal{B}\\rangle\\) where \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle\nT,\\prec\\rangle\\) is a tree and the bundle \\(\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{H}(\\mathcal{T})\\) is a non-empty set of histories such that\nevery instant in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) belongs to some history in\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) (Burgess 1978; 1980). The Ockhamist branching time\nlogic straightforwardly generalizes to bundled trees: the sole\ndifference is that the semantics is now restricted to histories from\nthe bundle. Bundled tree validity is equivalent to Kamp validity\n(Zanardo 1996; Reynolds 2002), but it is weaker than full Ockhamist\nvalidity. Reynolds (2002) provides the following example of a formula\nthat is Ockhamist valid but falsifiable in bundled trees (further\ncounterexamples were provided in e.g. Burgess 1978 and Nishimura\n1979): \n\n\\[\\Box G(\\Box p \\to \\Diamond F \\Box p) \\to \\Diamond G(\\Box p \\to F \\Box p).\\]\n\n The antecedent of this formula intuitively allows\none to construct a \u2018limit history\u2019 in which \\(\\Box p\\)\nalways holds from an infinite bundle of different histories. Such\nlimit histories may be omitted in bundled trees, which gave rise to\nphilosophical discussions concerning the adequacy of those frames (see\ne.g. Nishimura 1979; Thomason 1984; and Belnap et al. 2001).\n\nA complete axiomatization of bundled tree validity is given in Zanardo\n(1985) and Reynolds (2002). Finding a complete axiomatization for\nOckhamist validity turned out more difficult. It has been shown that\nthe class of Ockhamist trees is not definable in the class of bundled\ntrees (Zanardo et al. 1999). In Reynolds (2003), a complete\naxiomatization for Ockhamist validity is claimed and a proof sketched. In this system, the problem of emergent histories is dealt with by an\ninfinite axiom scheme that is based on the formula given above and is\nsupposed to guarantee the \u2018limit closure property\u2019. The\nfull proof, however, has not appeared yet. The proposed axiomatic system can be found in the supplementary document:\n\nReynolds\u2019 Axiomatic System for OBTL\n\n5.4 Extensions of Peirceanism and Ockhamism\n\nSeveral extensions and variations of the Peircean and Ockhamist\nbranching time temporal logics have been proposed and studied over the past\nyears, including logics that unify both frameworks, and we will\nbriefly mention some of them here.\n\nBrown and Goranko (1999) propose an axiomatization of a logic that\ncombines Peircean and Ockhamist ideas. The language of the Ockhamist\nbranching time logic is extended by a modality for an\nalternative branch, and a special kind of fan\nvariables is introduced to represent all histories passing\nthrough one instant.\n\nThe branching time logic with indistinguishability functions\ndeveloped in Zanardo (1998) unifies Peirceanism and Ockhamism. The\nlanguage extends the Peircean temporal logic by modal operators, and\nformulae are evaluated on so-called I-trees, which are trees\n\\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) with an indistinguishability\nfunction \\(I\\) that assigns to each time instant in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) a\npartition of the set of histories passing through that instant.\nWhereas in the Ockhamist semantics truth at an instant is relativized\nto a history, in the semantics on I-trees truth at an instant is\nrelativized to an equivalence class modulo indistinguishability at\nthat instant, i.e. to a set of histories. Peirceanism and Ockhamism\ncorrespond to the limiting cases where the partition is trivial, that\nis, a singleton or a set of singletons, respectively. For details, see\nZanardo (1998), as well as Zanardo (2013) and Ciuni and Zanardo\n(2010), where the idea is combined with elements of the stit\nlogic of agency.\n\nAn account that is similar in spirit and likewise unifies Peirceanism\nand Ockhamism is the transition semantics presented in\nRumberg (2016). The novel feature of this framework is that possible\ncourses of events are successively built up from local future\npossibilities: they are viewed as possibly non-maximal,\ndownward-closed chains of transitions, where each transition specifies a possible direction at a branching point. Incomplete possible courses of events become available as well,\nwhich can then be extended towards the future, and the language\ncontains, in addition to temporal and modal operators, a so-called\nstability operator, which allows one to capture how the truth value of\na formula about the future at an instant changes in the course of\ntime. Peirceanism and Ockhamism result as limiting cases by\nrestricting the range of admissible courses of events to the empty set of transitions and\nmaximal chains, respectively. For details, see Rumberg (2016; 2019)\nand Rumberg and Zanardo (2019). A brief overview is presented\nin the supplementary document:\n\nTransition Semantics\n\n5.5 The computation tree logics CTL and CTL*\n\nBranching time logics are extensively used in computer science. The\nmost popular ones are the computation tree logics CTL and CTL*, which\nare variations of the Peircean and Ockhamist branching time temporal\nlogics. They are interpreted on the class of so-called computation\ntrees, where every history has the order type of the natural\nnumbers. These trees are naturally obtained as tree unfoldings of\ndiscrete transition systems and represent the possible infinite\ncomputations arising in such systems. While CTL historically preceded\nCTL*, nowadays CTL is often viewed as a fragment of CTL*, and we\nfollow this convention here. \n\nThe full computation tree logic CTL* is the computational\nvariant of Ockhamism, and it was introduced by Emerson and Halpern\n(1985). The language of CTL* contains (the reflexive versions of) the\nfuture operators \\(G\\) and \\(U\\) (Until) as well as the\nNext Time operator \\(X\\) (no past operators), which are now\ninterpreted on computation trees. As in the general Ockhamist\nbranching time logic, the evaluation is relativized to both an instant\n(here called state) and a history (here called\npath). We note that in computer science usually instant-based\natomic propositions are assumed, i.e., the valuation of the atomic\npropositions depends only on the state.\nThe computation tree logic CTL is the computational\nvariant of Peirceanism, and it was introduced by Emerson and Clarke\n(1982). CTL is the fragment of CTL* where each of the temporal\noperators \\(G\\), \\(U\\), and \\(X\\) is immediately preceded by a modal\noperator, \\(\\Box\\) or \\(\\Diamond\\), here usually denoted as the path\nquantifiers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\). That is, the language of CTL\nis recursively built up using the combined modalities \\(\\forall\nG\\varphi\\), \\(\\forall(\\varphi U\\psi)\\), \\(\\forall X\\varphi\\) and\n\\(\\exists G\\varphi\\), \\(\\exists(\\varphi U\\psi)\\), \\(\\exists\nX\\varphi\\). A precursor of CTL is the logic UB, introduced by Ben-Ari\net al. (1983), in which \\(U\\) does not occur. \n\n\nThe logic CTL became widely used owing to its good computational\nproperties with regard to model checking, having linear\ncomplexity both in the size of the input formula and in the size of\nthe input model (as finite transition system). However, CTL is not\nvery expressive, which led to its extension CTL*. The logic CTL* is\nexpressively much more powerful and subsumes the linear time temporal logic\nLTL, but it has higher complexities of model checking (PSPACE) and of\ndeciding satisfiability (2EXPTIME). For references and further\ndetails, see Emerson (1990) and Stirling (1992).\n\nA complete axiomatization of CTL can be obtained by replacing the\naxioms of LTL by their path-quantified versions. For proofs of\ncompleteness, see Emerson (1990) and Goldblatt (1992). For CTL* more\naxioms must be added to account for the combinations of temporal and\nmodal operators and to enforce the limit closure property of trees. A\ncomplete axiomatization for CTL* was obtained by Reynolds (2001), and\na completeness result for the extension of CTL* with past operators is\nestablished in Reynolds (2005). A sketch of the axiomatic system for\nCTL can be found in the supplementary document:\n\nAn Axiomatic System for CTL\n\nWe note that the Peircean and Ockhamist branching time logics, as well\nas their computational variants, have the finite model property and\nare decidable. Proofs of decidability of the respective logics can be\nfound in e.g. Burgess (1980); Emerson and Sistla (1984); Gurevich and\nShelah (1985); Emerson and Halpern (1985); Emerson\n(1990); Goldblatt (1992); Gabbay et al. (1994); Finger et al. (2002); and Demri et al.\n(2016).\n6. Interval temporal logics\n\nInstant-based and interval-based models of time are two different\nkinds of temporal ontologies and, even though they are technically\nreducible to each other, this does not solve the main semantic issue\narising when developing a logical formalism to capture temporal\nreasoning: should propositions about time, and therefore formulae in\nthe given logical language, be interpreted as referring to time\ninstants or to intervals?\n\nThere have been various proposals and developments of interval-based\ntemporal logics in the philosophical logic literature. Important early\ncontributions include Hamblin (1972); Humberstone (1979); R\u00f6per\n(1980); and Burgess (1982b). The latter provides an axiomatization for\nan interval-based temporal logic involving the temporal precedence\nrelation between intervals on the rationals and the reals. The\ninterval-based approach to temporal reasoning has been very prominent\nin Artificial Intelligence. Some notable works here include\nAllen\u2019s logic of planning (Allen 1984), Kowalski and\nSergot\u2019s calculus of events (Kowalski and Sergot 1986), and\nHalpern and Shoham\u2019s modal interval logic (Halpern and Shoham\n1986). But, it also features in some applications in computer science,\nsuch as real-time logics and hardware verification,\nnotably Moszkowski\u2019s Interval Logic (Moszkowski 1983) and Zhou, Hoare, and\nRavn\u2019s Duration Calculus (see Hansen and Zhou 1997).\n\nHere we will briefly present the propositional modal interval logic\nproposed by Halpern and Shoham (1986), hereafter called\n\\(\\mathsf{HS}.\\) The language of \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) includes a family of\nunary interval operators of the form \\(\\langle X\\rangle,\\) one for\neach of Allen\u2019s interval relations over linear time. The respective notations are listed in Table 1\n (Section 2.2). Given a set of atomic propositions \\(PROP\\), formulae\nare recusively defined by the following grammar: \n\n\\[\\varphi := p \\in {PROP} \\mid \\bot \\mid \\neg \\varphi \\mid (\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi) \\mid \\langle X\\rangle\\varphi.\\]\n\nThe interval logic \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) starts from instant-based models\nover linear time, and intervals are considered defined elements. So\nlet \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) be a temporal frame and\nassume that the temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) induces a\nstrict linear order on the set of time instants \\(T\\). An\ninterval in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is defined as an ordered pair\n\\([a,b]\\) such that \\(a,b\\in T\\) and \\(a\\leq b.\\) The set of all\nintervals in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is denoted by\n\\(\\mathbb{I}(\\mathcal{T)}.\\) Note that the definition allows for\n\u2018point intervals\u2019 whose beginning and end points coincide,\nfollowing the original proposal by Halpern and Shoham (1986).\nSometimes, only \u2018strict\u2019 intervals are considered,\nexcluding point-intervals.\n\nIn interval-based temporal logic, formulae are evaluated relative to\ntime intervals rather than instants. An interval model is a\ntriple \\(\\mathcal{M} = \\langle T,\\prec,V\\rangle\\) consisting of a\ntemporal frame \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) and a\nvaluation \\(V\\) that assigns to each atomic proposition \\(p\\in{PROP}\\)\nthe set of time intervals \\(V(p) \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{I}(\\mathcal{T}))\\) at which \\(p\\) is considered\ntrue. The truth of an arbitrary formula \\(\\varphi\\) with respect to a given\ninterval \\([a,b]\\) in an interval model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is\ndefined by structural induction on formulae as follows:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\models p\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\([a,b]\\in\nV(p)\\), for \\(p \\in {PROP};\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\not\\models \\bot;\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\models \\neg\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\not\\models \\varphi;\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\models \\varphi \\wedge \\psi\\) \u00a0 iff\n\u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\models \\varphi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b]\n\\models \\psi;\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{M},[a,b] \\models \\langle X\\rangle\\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff\n\u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},[c,d] \\models \\varphi\\) for some interval\n\\([c,d]\\) such that \\([a,b]R_{X}[c,d]\\), where \\(R_X\\) is\nAllen\u2019s interval relation corresponding to the modal operator\n\\(\\langle X\\rangle\\) (cf.\n Table 1).\n \n\n\nThat is, the new interval operators are given a Kripke-style semantics\nover the associated Allen relations. E.g., for the Allen relation\n\u201cmeets\u201d, we have: \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{M},[t_{0},t_{1}] \\models \\langle A\\rangle \\varphi \\text{ iff } \\mathcal{M},[t_{1},t_{2}] \\models \\varphi \\text{ for some interval } [t_{1},t_{2}].\n\\]\n\n\nFor each diamond modality \\(\\langle X\\rangle,\\) the corresponding box\nmodality is defined as its dual: \\([X] \\varphi \\equiv \\neg \\langle\nX\\rangle \\neg \\varphi.\\) Sometimes it is useful to include an\nadditional modal constant for point intervals, denoted \\(\\pi,\\) with\nthe following truth definition: \n\n\\[\n \\mathcal{M},[a,b]\\models\\pi \\text{ iff } a=b.\n\\]\n\n\nSome of the \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) modalities are definable in terms of\nothers, and for each of the strict and non-strict semantics, minimal\nfragments that are expressive enough to define all other operators\nhave been identified. Complete sets of equivalences that allow one to\ndefine certain \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) modalities in terms of others are\npresented in the supplementary document:\n\nInter-definability of \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) Modalities\n\n\nThe logic \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) has over a thousand expressively\nnon-equivalent fragments involving only some of the modal operators,\nwhich have been studied extensively (see Della Monica et al. 2011 for\na recent survey). \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) and most of its fragments are very\nexpressive, and the respective notions of validity are usually\nundecidable (under some additional assumptions even highly\nundecidable, viz. \\(\\Pi^{1}_{1}\\)-complete). However, some quite\nnon-trivial decidable fragments of HS have been identified. Probably\nthe best studied one is the neighborhood interval logic,\nwhich involves the operators \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\langle\\overline{A}\\rangle\\) (Goranko et al. 2003). One specific\naxiom for \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) (and symmetrically for\n\\(\\langle\\overline{A}\\rangle\\)) is \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\langle A\n\\rangle\\langle A \\rangle p \\to \\langle A \\rangle\\langle A \\rangle p,\\)\nsaying that any two consecutive right-neighboring intervals can be\njoined into one right-neighboring interval.\n\nIn addition to the unary \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) interval modalities\nassociated with Allen\u2019s binary interval relations, there is a\nnatural and important operation of chopping an interval into two\nsubintervals, which gives rise to the ternary interval relation\n\u2018chop\u2019, proposed and studied in Moszkowski (1983). The\nframework was later extended in Venema (1991) to the logic CDT, which\ninvolves next to \u2018chop\u2019 (\\(C\\)), the two residual\n\u2018chop\u2019 operators \\(D\\) and \\(T.\\) The logic CDT was\ncompletely axiomatized in Venema (1991); see also Goranko et al.\n(2004) and Konur (2013).\n\nThere is a natural spatial interpretation of interval temporal logics,\nbased on the idea that the pairs of points that define an interval on\na linear order \\(L\\) can be considered coordinates of a point in the\n\\(L \\times L\\)-plane. Relations between intervals are then interpreted\nas spatial relations between the corresponding points. This\ninterpretation has been fruitfully explored to transfer various\ntechnical results between spatial and interval logics, such as\nundecidability, see e.g. Venema (1990) and Marx and Reynolds\n(1999).\n\nLastly, a few words about the relationship between interval temporal\nlogics and first-order logic. The standard translation of\nPrior\u2019s basic tense logic TL into first-order logic (presented\nin\n Section 3.3)\n extends naturally to interval logics, where atomic propositions are\nrepresented in the first-order language by binary relations. It turns\nout that some fragments of \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) can be translated into the\ntwo-variable fragment FO\\(^{2}\\) of first-order logic, which\neventually implies their decidability. The expressively strongest such\ninterval logic is the neighborhood interval logic, which was proven to\nbe expressively complete for FO\\(^{2}\\) (Bresolin et al. 2009). Other\nfragments of \\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) require at least three distinct variables\nfor the standard translation. Still, even the full logic\n\\(\\mathsf{HS}\\) is less expressive than the three-variable fragment\nFO\\(^{3}\\) of first-order logic, for which Venema (1991) showed that\nthe logic CDT is expressively complete.\n\nFor more on interval temporal logics, see Halpern and Shoham (1986);\nVenema (1990); Goranko et al. (2003; 2004); Della Monica et al.\n(2011); the survey Konur (2013), and the references therein.\n7. Other variants of temporal logics\n\nSo far we have discussed the traditional family of temporal logics,\nbut there are numerous variations and alternative developments that\nprovide useful formalisms for various applications. We briefly present\nsome of them here: hybrid temporal logics, metric and real-time\ntemporal logics, and quantified propositional logics.\n7.1 Hybrid temporal logics\n\nA notable family of temporal logics, enriching the traditional\nframework, are hybrid temporal logics, which combine\npropositional temporal logic with elements of first-order logic and\nthereby considerably increase the expressive power of the\nlanguage.\n\nThe most prominent notion in hybrid temporal logics is that of a\nnominal. Nominals are special atomic propositions in that\nthey are considered to be true at exactly one instant of the temporal\nmodel. Hence, one can think of a nominal \\(a\\) as saying \u201cIt is\n\\(a\\) o\u2019clock now\u201d. For this reason, nominals are\nsometimes also called \u2018clock variables\u2019. The idea of\nnominals can be traced back to Prior (1967, Chapter V; 1968, Chapter\nXI), who considered the possibility of identifying instants with\ninstant-propositions: an instant can be conceived of as the\nconjunction of all those propositions that are true at that instant. A\nfirst systematic treatment of hybrid temporal logic was given in Bull\n(1970). In addition to nominals, hybrid languages are often augmented\nby further syntactic mechanisms, such as a satisfaction operator,\nnominal quantifiers, and reference pointers, which we briefly discuss\nbelow. The former two mechanisms can already be found in Prior\u2019s\nwork (see Blackburn 2006) and were reinvented independently in Passy and Tinchev (1985). Reference pointers were introduced only much later\nin Goranko (1996), and a similar referencing mechanism is found in\nAlur and Henzinger (1994).\n\nSatisfaction operator: The satisfaction operator\n\\(@_{i}\\) allows one to express that a given formula is true in a\nmodel at the time instant denoted by the nominal \\(i\\). That is,\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash @_{i}\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{M},V(i)\\vDash\n\\varphi,\\) where \\( V(i)\\) is the unique instant where \\(i\\) is true.\nThe notion of truth at an instant of a temporal model is imported into\nthe object-language.\nQuantifiers over nominals: By means of the nominal\nquantifier \\(\\forall i\\) one can express that a given formula is true\nat a given time instant in a temporal model under each possible\nassignment of time instants to \\(i\\). More formally,\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash \\forall i\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{M}_{[i\\rightarrow\ns]},t\\vDash \\varphi\\) for any instant \\(s\\) in \\(\\mathcal{M},\\) where\n\\(\\mathcal{M}_{[i\\rightarrow s]}\\) is the model obtained from\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) by re-assigning the denotation of \\(i\\) to be \\(s.\\)\nThe full power of first-order quantification is brought into the\ntemporal language, while many of its propositional virtues are\npreserved.\nReference pointers: Reference pointers \\(\\downarrow_{i}\\)\nare often also referred to as \u2018binders\u2019, for they bind the\nvalue of the nominal \\(i\\) to the current instant of evaluation. A\nformula \\(\\downarrow_{i}\\varphi\\) is true at a given instant \\(t\\) in\na temporal model iff \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t\\) whenever the nominal\n\\(i\\) denotes \\(t\\). That is, \\(\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash\n\\downarrow_{i}\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{M}_{[i\\rightarrow t]},t\\vDash\n\\varphi\\). Reference pointers provide a mechanism for referring to the\ncurrent time instant, i.e. saying \u2018now\u2019. For a systematic\nlogical treatment of \u2018now\u2019, see Kamp (1971).\n\n\nOther operators that can be considered hybrid temporal logic operators\nare the universal modality, the difference modality, and propositional\nquantifiers. The universal modality \\(A\\) says that a given\nformula is true at every instant of the temporal modal and hence\ncaptures the global notion of truth in a model: \\(\\mathcal{M},t\\vDash\nA\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{M}\\vDash\\varphi\\). The difference\nmodality \\(D\\), on the other hand, states that the given formula\nis true at some other instant. Note that both modalities abstract away\nfrom the underlying accessibility relation. Propositional\nquantifiers \\(\\forall p\\) introduce second-order quantification\ninto the propositional language, and we discuss them in\n Section 7.3\n below.\n\nHybrid languages are very expressive. Here are just two examples:\n\nIrreflexivity of the precedence relation, which is not expressible\nin TL, can be expressed in a language with nominals and the\nsatisfaction operator \\(@_i\\) as \\(@_{i}G\\lnot i.\\)\nThe operators \\(S\\) and \\(U\\) are definable in a language with\nnominals and binders: \\(\\varphi U\\psi :={\\downarrow _{i}}F(\\psi \\wedge\nH(Pi\\rightarrow \\varphi))\\) and likewise for \\(S.\\)\n\n\nWhile the weaker versions of hybrid logics \u2014 with nominals,\nsatisfaction operators, universal modality, and difference modality\n\u2014 are still decidable, the more expressive ones \u2014 with\nquantifiers over nominals or reference pointers \u2014 are usually\nundecidable. For details, see Goranko (1996); and Areces and ten Cate\n(2006).\n\nBranching time versions of hybrid temporal logics have been\ninvestigated as well. For an overview of varieties of hybrid temporal\nlogics and their historical development, see Blackburn and Tzakova\n(1999) and the entry on\n hybrid logic.\n7.2 Metric and real-time temporal logics\n\nMetric temporal logics go back to Prior, too (see Prior 1967, Chapter\nVI). He used the notation \\(Pn\\varphi\\) for \u201cIt was the case the\ninterval \\(n\\) ago that \\(\\varphi\\)\u201d (i.e. \\(\\varphi\\) was the\ncase \\(n\\) time units ago) and \\(Fn\\varphi\\) for \u201cIt will be the\ncase the interval \\(n\\) hence that \\(\\varphi\\)\u201d (i.e \\(\\varphi\\)\nwill be the case \\(n\\) time units hence). These operators presuppose\nthat time has a certain metric structure and can be carved up into\ntemporal units, which may be associated with clock times (e.g. hours,\ndays, years, etc.). If the relevant units are days, for example, the\noperator \\(F 1\\) reads \u2018tomorrow\u2019.\n\nPrior noted that \\(P n\\varphi\\) can be defined as \\(F(-n)\\varphi.\\)\nThe case \\(n=0\\) accordingly amounts to the present tense. The metric\noperators validate combination principles such as: \n\n\\[FnFm\\varphi \\rightarrow F(n+m)\\varphi.\\] \n\n\nThe interrelation of the metric and non-metric versions of the\ntemporal operators is captured by the following equivalences:\n\n\\[\\begin{matrix}\nP\\varphi \\equiv \\exists {n}({n} \\lt 0 \\land Fn\\varphi) \n   & F\\varphi \\equiv \\exists n(n \\gt 0 \\land Fn\\varphi) \\\\\nH\\varphi \\equiv \\forall {n}({n} \\lt 0 \\rightarrow Fn\\varphi) \n   & G\\varphi \\equiv \\forall n(n \\gt 0 \\rightarrow Fn\\varphi).\n\\end{matrix}\\]\n\n\nInstant-based temporal logics for metric time are studied in e.g.\nRescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter X); Montanari (1996); and\nMontanari and Policriti (1996). For metric interval logics, see\nBresolin et al. (2013).\n\nVarious metric extensions of temporal logics over the structure of the\nreal numbers have been proposed as well, giving rise to so-called\nreal-time logics. These logics introduce additional\noperators, such as the following, which allow for different\nformalizations of the example sentence \u201cwhenever \\(p\\) holds in\nthe future, \\(q\\) will hold within three time units later\u201d:\n\ntime-bounded operators, e.g.: \\(G(p \\to F_{_{\\leq 3}} q);\\)\nfreeze quantifiers (similar to hybrid logic reference pointers),\ne.g.: \\(Gx. (p \\to Fy. (q \\land y\\leq x+3));\\)\nquantifiers over time variables, e.g.: \\(\\forall x G(p \\land t=x\n\\to F(q \\land t\\leq x+3)).\\)\n\n\nSuch real-time extensions are usually very expressive and often lead\nto logics with undecidable decision problems. A way to regain\ndecidability is to relax \u201cpunctuality\u201d requirements\ninvolving precise time durations, by requirements involving time\nintervals. For details, see e.g. Koymans (1990); Alur and Henzinger (1992; 1993; 1994)\nas well as Reynolds (2010; 2014) on the real-time linear temporal\nlogic RTL, and the survey Konur (2013).\n7.3 Quantified propositional temporal logics\n\nPropositional temporal logics can be extended with quantifiers over\natomic propositions (see Rescher and Urquhart 1971, Chapter XIX).\nSemantically, these quantify over all valuations of the respective\natomic propositions and hence are tantamount to monadic second-order\nquantifiers. The resulting languages are very expressive, and the\nrespective logics are usually undecidable (often not even recursively\naxiomatizable). Notable extensions include the logic QPTL, the\nquantified propositional version of LTL (which is decidable albeit\nwith non-elementary complexity), as well as the extension of CTL* (see\nFrench 2001). Complete axiomatic systems and decidability results for\nthe quantified propositional temporal logic QPTL (with and without\npast operators) have been presented in Kesten and Pnueli (2002) and\nFrench and Reynolds (2003).\n8. First-order temporal logics\n\nObjects exist in time, and they change their properties over time.\nPropositional temporal logics are not expressive enough to capture\nthis dynamic aspect of the world, for all that is associated with a\ntime instant in a model of propositional temporal logics is a set of\nabstract atomic propositions that are declared true there. What is\nneeded, instead, is a full-fledged model of the temporal history of\nthe world, with objects that may have certain properties and stand in\ncertain relations. Accordingly, the language should contain names for\nobjects, variables and quantifiers ranging over objects, as well as\npredicates for denoting properties and relations, to adequately\ndescribe how the world is at a given instant in time \u2014 in\naddition to temporal operators for reasoning about how the world\nchanges over time. This is what first-order temporal logics\nprovide.\n8.1 Existence and quantification in time\n\nExistence in time is a major topic in the philosophy of time. Usually,\nobjects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at\nsome later time. But what is it for an object to exist in time? Do\nonly present objects exist, as a presentist would have it, or\nis existence to be understood in a broader sense comprising past and\nfuture objects as well, as an eternalist would hold? The\ncontroversy between presentism and eternalism is\naccompanied by a debate on persistence, that is, on the\nquestion how objects exist through time. Are objects wholly present at\neach instant at which they exist \u2014 a view known as\nendurantism \u2014 or do they persist by having different\ntemporal stages at different instants in time \u2014 a view called\nperdurantism? For a detailed overview of these debates, see\ne.g.\u00a0Dyke and Bardon (2013), Meyer (2013), as well as the entries\non\n time,\n temporal parts, and\n identity over time.\n\nSimilar questions concerning the existence of objects in time and\ntheir identity over time arise in the context of first-order temporal\nlogics, albeit under a different guise. These questions become\nparticularly important when it comes to the interaction of temporality\nand quantification. For example, the sentence \u201cA philosopher\nwill be a king\u201d can be interpreted in several different ways,\nsuch\n as[5]\n\n\n\n\\(\\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land {F} \\, king({x}))\\)\n\nSomeone who is now a philosopher will be a king at some future\ntime.\n\n\\(\\exists {x}{F} (philosopher({x})\\land king({x}))\\)\n\nThere now exists someone who will at some future time be both a\nphilosopher and a king.\n\n\\({F} \\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land {F}\\, king({x}))\\)\n\nThere will exist someone who is a philosopher and later will be a\nking.\n\n\\({F} \\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land king({x}))\\)\n\nThere will exist someone who is at the same time both a\nphilosopher and a king.\n\n\nThe interpretations given above assume that the domain of\nquantification is always relative to a time instant and that the same\nindividual may exist at multiple times. To enable these\ninterpretations, we need to introduce in the models a local\ndomain of objects \\({D}({t})\\) for each time instant \\(t\\), to\nrestrict the range of the quantifiers to that domain, and to identify\nthe same object across different times.\n\nMoreover, the example above suggests that the local domain at a given\ntime instant contains exactly those individuals that do in fact exist\nat that instant. From a logical point of view, however, there are\nalternative ways how to think of the local domains associated with\ntime instants, which mirror different conceptions of existence in\ntime. Here are four natural options:\n\n\n\nObjects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at a\nlater time, i.e., they actually exist only over a certain period of\ntime. This idea can be formally captured by assuming that the local\ndomain at a given time instant comprises those, and only those,\nobjects that presently exist at that instant. Thus, objects belong to\nthe local domains of precisely those instants at which they actually\nexist, and the local domains accordingly vary over time.\n\n\nObjects actually exist over a period of time, but they remain in the\ntemporal history of the world once they have ceased to actually exist.\nOn this account, the local domain at an instant includes not only\nthose objects that presently exist but all past objects as well. That\nis, the local domains increase as time progresses and new objects come\ninto being.\n\n\nAlternatively, one may hold that all objects that will ever exist are\ninitially part of the temporal history of the world but drop out once\nthey have ceased to actually exist. Technically, this amounts to the\nidea that the local domain at an instant comprises all present and\nfuture objects. Thus, the local domains decrease as time progresses\nand objects go out of being.\n\n\nPast, present, and future objects likewise exist. This is the notion\nof existence in an eternalist sense. One way to formally capture this\nidea is by requiring that the local domain associated with a time\ninstant contains all objects that are part of the temporal history of\nthe world. Hence, the local domains remain constant over\ntime.\n\n\nA conceptually different but technically closely related issue\nconcerns the scope of quantification. What do we quantify over in a\ntemporal setting?\n\n\n\nOnly over those objects that presently exist at the current time\ninstant, as presupposed in the above example?\n\n\nOver all present, past, and future objects in the temporal history of\nthe world?\n\n\nAdopting the terminology \u2018actualist quantification\u2019 and\n\u2018possibilist quantification\u2019 by Fitting and Mendelsohn\n(1998) to the temporal case, we may refer to the first kind of\nquantification as presentist quantification and use the term\neternalist quantification for the latter. Depending on the\nchoice between these options, the sentence \u201cEvery human is born\nafter 1888\u201d, for instance, can be true or false. It is true if\nwe quantify only over those humans that are currently alive; but it is\nfalse if we quantify over all humans in the temporal history of the\nworld, including those that have ever lived. A further issue arising\nhere concerns fictitious entities, such as Santa Claus or Pippi\nLongstocking, which do not actually exist at any time instant. Still,\nthey may be said to exist in a broader sense, and one may want to\ninclude them in the domain of quantification. We set this issue aside\nhere and refer the reader to the entry on free logic, which is a logic that allows reference to non-existing entities (cf. also Section 8.6).\n\nMany of the questions concerning the interrelation of existence and\nquantification arising here correspond to well known problems in modal\nfirst-order logics, where an extensive discussion on these issues\nstarted already with Frege and Russell and peaked in the 1940s-1950s\nin the works of R. Barcan-Marcus, R. Carnap, W. Quine, R. Montague,\nand others (see the entry on\n modal logic).\n A central issue in first-order modal logics relates to the validity or\ninvalidity of the so-called Barcan formula, a temporal version of\nwhich intuitively says: \u201cIf at some time in the future there\nwill be something that is \\(Q\\), then there is something now that will\nbe \\(Q\\) at some time in the future.\u201d Whether this statement is\nguaranteed to be true crucially depends on how the local domains at\nthe various instants in time are construed and what our quantifiers\nrange over. What is more, temporal logic yields two versions of the\nBarcan formula, one for the future and one for the past.\n8.2 The language and models of FOTL\n\nA basic language of first-order temporal logic (FOTL) is essentially\nan extension of a given first-order language by the operators \\(P\\)\nand \\(F\\). Whereas in propositional temporal logics atomic\npropositions are unstructured entities, in first-order temporal logics\natomic formulae are built up from terms denoting individuals and\npredicate symbols denoting relations, and the language is equipped\nwith quantifiers ranging over individuals. (A brief overview of\nfirst-order logic is provided in the supplementary document\n  First-order Relational Structures and Languages.) \nIn what follows, we consider FOTL over a relational first-order\nlanguage (no function symbols) with equality. The set of formulae is\ndefined as follows:\n\n\\[\\varphi \\ \\ := \\ R(\\tau_1,\\dots,\\tau_n) \\ | \\ \\tau_1 = \\tau_2 \\ | \\\n\\bot \\ | \\ \\neg \\varphi \\ | \\ (\\varphi \\land \\varphi) \\ | \\ \\forall x\n\\varphi \\ | \\ P \\varphi \\ | \\ F \\varphi, \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(R(\\tau_1,\\dots,\\tau_n)\\) and \\(\\tau_1 = \\tau_2\\) are atomic\nformulae. The truth functional connectives \\(\\vee, \\rightarrow\\), and\n\\(\\leftrightarrow\\), as well as the temporal operators \\(H\\) and\n\\(G\\), can be defined as usual. Moreover, the dual \\(\\exists\\) of\n\\(\\forall\\) is defined by \\(\\exists x \\varphi := \\neg \\forall x \\neg\n\\varphi\\).\n\nThe models of FOTL are based on temporal frames where each time\ninstant is associated with a first-order relational structure.\nFormally, a first-order temporal model is a quintuple:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{M}= (T, \\prec,\\mathcal{U},D,\\mathcal{I})\n\\]\n\n where:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{T}= \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\) is a temporal\nframe;\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is the global domain (universe)\nof\nthe model;\n\n\n\\(D: T \\to \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{U})\\) is a domain function,\nassigning to each time instant \\(t\\in T\\) a local domain\n\\(D_{t} \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{U}= \\bigcup_{t\\in\n T}D_t\\).[6]\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is an interpretation function, assigning for\neach \\(t\\in T\\):\n\n\n\nan object \\(\\mathcal{I}_{t}(c) \\in \\mathcal{U}\\) to each constant\nsymbol \\(c\\);\n\n\nan \\(n\\)-ary relation \\(\\mathcal{I}_{t}(R) \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}^{n}\\)\nto each \\(n\\)-ary predicate symbol \\(R\\).\n\n\nNote, that the interpretations of the constant and predicate symbols\nare defined locally, i.e.\u00a0with respect to a given time instant,\nwhile the respective extensions range over the global domain. This\napproach allows for reference to objects that do not currently exist\nand enables a proper treatment of cross-temporal relations, as, for\nexample, in the sentence \u201cOne of my friends is a descendant of a\nfollower of William the Conqueror\u201d.\n\n\nThe quadruple \\(\\mathcal{F} = (T,\\prec,\\mathcal{U},D)\\) is called the\naugmented temporal frame of the model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). Since\nthe model is supposed to represent the temporal evolution of the\nworld, the local domains at the different time instants in the\nunderlying augmented temporal frame must be suitably connected. There\nare four natural cases to distinguish for an augmented temporal frame,\nrespectively for any first-order temporal model based on it:\n\n\n\nvarying domains: no restrictions apply;\n\n\nexpanding (increasing)\ndomains: for all \\(t,t' \\in T\\), if\n\\(t \\prec t',\\) then \\(D_{t} \\subseteq D_{t'}\\);\n\n\nshrinking (decreasing)\ndomains: for all \\(t,t' \\in T\\), if\n\\(t \\prec t',\\) then \\(D_{t'} \\subseteq D_{t}\\);\n\n\nlocally constant domains: for all \\(t,t' \\in T\\), if \\(t\n\\prec t',\\) then \\(D_{t} = D_{t'}\\).\n\nThus, an augmented temporal frame \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has locally constant\ndomains if and only if it has both expanding and shrinking domains. In\nparticular, we say that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has a constant domain\nif all local domains are the same as the global domain. Since the\nglobal domain is required to be the union of all local domains, having\nlocally constant domains implies having a constant domain in case the\nset of time instants forms a temporally connected whole.\n\n\nOne natural way to make sense of the four cases distinguished here is\nby means of the four notions of existence in time discussed in\n Section\u00a08.1\n above.\n8.3 Semantics of FOTL\n\nAs in propositional temporal logic, formulae of FOTL are evaluated in\nfirst-order temporal models locally at time instants. However, since\nthe formulae of FOTL may contain variables, the notion of truth is\nrelativized not only to a model and a time instant but also to a\nvariable assignment. We denote the set of individual variables of FOTL\nby \\(\\mathrm{VAR}\\) and the set of individual terms\n(i.e.\u00a0variables and constants) by \\(\\mathrm{TERM}\\).\n\nGiven a first-order temporal model \\(\\mathcal{M}= (T,\n\\prec,\\mathcal{U},D,\\mathcal{I})\\), a variable assignment in\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is a mapping \\(v: \\mathrm{VAR} \\to \\mathcal{U}\\)\nthat assigns to each variable \\(x \\in \\mathrm{VAR}\\) an element\n\\(v(x)\\) in the global domain \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) of the model. Each such\nassignment \\(v\\) can be uniquely extended to a term valuation\n\\(v: T \\times \\mathrm{TERM} \\to \\mathcal{U}\\) as follows: \n\n\\[v_{t}(x) := v(x), \\  v_{t}(c) :=  \\mathcal{I}_{t}(c).\n\\]\n\nNote that the variable assignment is defined globally, whereas the\nvaluation of the constant symbols depends on the respective time\ninstant.\n\nThe truth of an arbitrary formula \\(\\varphi\\) of FOTL at a given\ntime instant \\(t\\) in a given first-order temporal model\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) with respect to a variable assignment \\(v\\)\n(denoted \\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models_{v} \\varphi\\)) is now defined\ninductively as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models_{v} R(\\tau_{1},\\ldots,\\tau_{n})\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\((v_{t}(\\tau_{1}),\\ldots,v_{t}(\\tau_{n})) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{t}(R)\\),\n\nfor any \\(n\\)-ary predicate symbol \\(R\\) and terms\n\\(\\tau_{1},\\ldots,\\tau_{n} \\in \\mathrm{TERM}\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models_{v} \\tau_{1}=\\tau_{2}\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(v_{t}(\\tau_1) =\nv_{t}(\\tau_2)\\), for any terms \\(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2} \\in\n\\mathrm{TERM}\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\not\\models_{v} \\bot\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t \\models_{v} \\lnot \\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\not\\models_{v} \\varphi\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} \\varphi \\land \\psi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} \\varphi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v}\n\\psi\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} P \\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models_{v}\n\\varphi\\) for some \\(t'\\in T\\) such that \\(t' \\prec t\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} F \\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \\(\\mathcal{M},t'\\models_{v}\n\\varphi\\) for some \\(t'\\in T\\) such that \\(t \\prec t'\\);\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} \\forall x \\varphi\\) \u00a0 iff \u00a0 \u2026\n\n\n\n\npresentist quantification:\n\u2026\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v[a/x]} \\varphi\\) for every \\(a\\in\nD_{t}\\);\n\n\neternalist quantification:\n\u2026\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v[a/x]} \\varphi\\) for every \\(a\\in\n\\mathcal{U}\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(v[a/x]\\) is the variant of the variable assignment \\(v\\) such\nthat \\(v[a/x](x) = a\\).\n\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, there are two natural approaches to\nquantification in temporal logic: presentist quantification\nand eternalist quantification. Technically, presentist\nquantification amounts to quantification over the local\ndomain at the given time instant whereas eternalist quantification is\nconstrued as quantification over the global domain. The\nrespective semantic clauses for the dual \\(\\exists\\) of \\(\\forall\\)\naccordingly read as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v} \\exists x \\varphi\\) iff \u2026\n\n\n\npresentist quantification:\n\u2026\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v[a/x]} \\varphi\\) for some \\(a\\in\nD_t\\);\n\n\neternalist quantification:\n\u2026\\(\\mathcal{M},t\\models_{v[a/x]} \\varphi\\) for some \\(a\\in\n\\mathcal{U}\\).\n\n\n\nNote that presentist quantification naturally relates to first-order\ntemporal models with varying domains, while in the semantics based on\neternalist quantification the local domains do not play any essential\nrole. In fact, from a technical point of view, eternalist\nquantification amounts to the assumption that the model has a constant\ndomain, i.e., all local domains equal the global domain. Moreover, in\nconstant domain models the semantics based on presentist\nquantification coincides with the semantics based on eternalist\nquantification. Thus, presentist quantification suggests a varying\ndomain semantics, whereas the semantics associated with\neternalist quantification is a constant domain semantics, and\nin what follows we will use these expressions interchangeably.\n\nIn each of these semantics, a FOTL formula \\(\\varphi\\) is said to be\nvalid in a model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) iff it is true in that model\nat each time instant with respect to every variable assignment; it is\nvalid in an augmented temporal frame iff it is valid in each\nmodel based on that frame; and it is valid iff it is valid in\nevery model.\n\nAdopting one or the other approach to quantification affects the\nnotion of validity, even for non-temporal principles. For instance, the\nsentence \\(\\exists x(x= c)\\) is valid in first-order logic, and it is\nvalid in the constant domain semantics as well, but it is no longer\nvalid in the varying domain semantics, because the object assigned to\nthe constant \\(c\\) may not belong to the local domain. Another\nprinciple from plain first-order logic that distinguishes the two\nsemantics is the scheme of Universal Instantiation (where\n\\(\\tau\\) is any term free for substitution for \\(x\\) in \\(\\varphi\\)):\n\n\\[\\forall x \\varphi(x) \\to  \\varphi(\\tau),\n\\]\n\n which is, likewise, valid in the constant domain\nsemantics but invalid in the varying domain semantics, for analogous\nreasons. The main distinction between the two semantics is, however,\nin terms of principles that involve interaction of temporal operators\nand quantification, such as the Barcan formula schemata and their\nconverses. In the following two sections, we take a closer look at\nsome important validities and non-validities in the respective\nsemantics.\n8.4 Eternalist quantification and constant domain semantics\n\nLet us look at some FOTL validities and non-validities in the constant\ndomain semantics, that is, in the semantics with eternalist\nquantification. We denote validity in the constant domain semantics by\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}}\\).\n\n\n\nAll FOTL instances of valid first-order formulae are\nCD-valid.\n\n\nIn particular, the scheme of Universal Instantiation is\nCD-valid:\n\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} \\forall x \\varphi(x) \\to \\varphi(\\tau)\\), for\nany term \\(\\tau\\) free for substitution for \\(x\\) in\n\\(\\varphi\\).\n\n\nThe Future Barcan\n Formula[7]\n scheme, \\(\\mathsf{BF}_{G}\\), is CD-valid:\n\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} \\forall x G \\varphi(x) \\to G \\forall x\n\\varphi(x)\\) or, equivalently, \n\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} F \\exists x\n\\varphi(x) \\to \\exists x F \\varphi(x)\\).\n\n\nThe Converse Future Barcan Formula scheme,\n\\(\\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\\), is CD-valid:\n\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} G \\forall x \\varphi(x) \\to \\forall x G\n\\varphi(x)\\) or, equivalently, \n\n\\(\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} \\exists x F\n\\varphi(x) \\to F \\exists x \\varphi(x)\\).\n\n\nSome important non-validities include:\n\n\\(\\not\\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} \\forall x F \\varphi(x) \\to F \\forall x\n\\varphi(x)\\) \u00a0and \u00a0\\(\\not \\models_{\\mathrm{CD}} G \\exists x\n\\varphi(x) \\to \\exists x G \\varphi(x)\\).\n\n\nAnalogous claims hold for the past versions of the above schemes, with\n\\(H\\) and \\(P\\) instead of \\(G\\) and \\(F\\). An axiomatic system for\nthe minimal FOTL with constant domain semantics, as well as some\nimportant theorems of it, are provided in the supplementary\ndocument:\n\nAxiomatic System FOTL(CD) for the Minimal FOTL with Constant Domain Semantics\n\n8.5 Presentist quantification and varying domain semantics\n\nIn the varying domain semantics, free variables range over the global\ndomain, whereas quantifiers are given a presentist reading, i.e., they\nquantify over the local domains only. As a consequence, some formulae\nthat are valid in the semantics with constant domains are no longer\nvalid in the varying domain semantics. Most importantly, the varying\ndomain semantics invalidates Universal Instantiation \\(\\forall x\n\\varphi(x) \\to \\varphi(\\tau)\\) as well as both the Future and Past\nBarcan Formula schemata and their converses. We denote validity in the\nvarying domain semantics by \\(\\models_{\\mathrm{VD}}\\).\n\nIn fact, the Barcan formulae schemata \\(\\mathsf{BF}_{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathsf{BF}_{H}\\) and their converses \\(\\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\\) correspond to conditions on the local domains.\nFor any augmented temporal frame \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), the following\nholds:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has expanding domains iff \\(\\mathcal{F}\n\\models_{\\mathrm{VD}} \\mathsf{BF}_{H}\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{F}\n\\models_{\\mathrm{VD}} \\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\\);\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has shrinking domains iff \\(\\mathcal{F}\n\\models_{\\mathrm{VD}} \\mathsf{BF}_{G}\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{F}\n\\models_{\\mathrm{VD}} \\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\\).\n\n\nNote that the Future Barcan scheme \\(\\mathsf{BF}_{G}\\) semantically\ncorresponds to the converse Past Barcan scheme \\(\\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\\),\nand vice versa. From the above it follows that an augmented\ntemporal frame \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has locally constant domains iff either\nof the following formulae is VD-valid in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\):\n\\(\\mathsf{BF}_{G} \\wedge \\mathsf{BF}_{H}\\), \\(\\mathsf{CBF}_{G} \\wedge\n\\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\\), \\(\\mathsf{BF}_{G} \\wedge \\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\\), or\n\\(\\mathsf{BF}_{H} \\wedge \\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\\).\n\nAn axiomatic system for the minimal FOTL with varying domain semantics\nis provided in the supplementary document:\n\nAxiomatic System FOTL(VD) for the Minimal FOTL with Varying Domain Semantics\n\n8.6 The existence predicate\n\nWhile presentism and eternalism are alternative theories in the\nphilosophy of time, their respective technical manifestations are\ninterreducible. On the one hand, the constant domain semantics with\neternalist quantification can be obtained from the varying domain\nsemantics with presentist quantification by imposing the constraint\nthat the Past and Future Barcan Formula schemata and their converses\nbe valid. On the other hand, the varying domain semantics can be\nsimulated in the constant domain semantics by adding to the language\nof FOTL an existence predicate for \u2018existence at the\ncurrent time instant\u2019, which can be defined in the varying\ndomain semantics by \\(E(\\tau) := \\exists x (x=\\tau)\\).\n\nWith the existence predicate at our disposal, the sentence \u201cSome\nman exists who signed the Declaration of Independence\u201d can be\nformalized in two different ways: \n\n\\[\\exists x(\\mathsf{man}(x) \\land P(\\mathsf{signs}(x)))\n\\]\n\n and \n\n\\[\\exists x(E(x) \\land \\mathsf{man}(x) \\land P(\\mathsf{signs}(x))).\n\\]\n\n While\nthe former formula is true at the present instant in the constant\ndomain semantics with eternalist quantification, the latter formula is\npresently false in that semantics, but it was true in 1777.\n\nTo generalize, for every formula \\(\\varphi\\) of FOTL, its\n\\(E\\)-relativization in the extended language can be obtained\nby replacing every occurrence of \\(\\forall x\\) in \\(\\varphi\\) by\n\u201c\\(\\forall x (E(x) \\to ...)\\)\u201d and every occurrence of\n\\(\\exists x\\) by \u201c\\(\\exists x (E(x) \\land ...)\\)\u201d. Then\nthe following holds: for any FOTL sentence \\(\\varphi\\) not containing\n\\(E\\), \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in the varying domain semantics if and\nonly if its \\(E\\)-relativization is valid in the constant domain\nsemantics. The question that remains, from a philosophical\npoint of view, is whether existence is a legitimate predicate. An axiomatic system for the minimal FOTL with existence\npredicate can be obtained along the lines of free logic, as outlined\nin the supplementary document:\n\nAxioms for the Minimal FOTL with \\(E\\): the Free Logic Version\n\n8.7 Proper names and definite descriptions\n\nA further issue arising in first-order temporal logic relates to the\ninterpretation of individual terms. Depending on what kind of terms we\nare dealing with, we may or may not want to allow their interpretation\nto vary with time.\n\nIn the semantics outlined above, variable assignments are defined\nglobally, and hence individual variables pick out the same object at\nall times. The interpretation of constant symbols, on the other hand, is\nspecified locally, relative to a time instant, even though the\nrespective extensions range over the global domain. From a\nphilosophical point of view, it seems natural to treat constant\nsymbols as proper names or as rigid designators,\nthat is, to impose the additional requirement that their\ninterpretations be constant across different times. Constant symbols\ncan then be used to identify an object in time. For instance, treating\n\\(a\\) as a name for Aristotle, the sentence \u201cAristotle existed\nbut does no longer exist\u201d can be formalized in the varying domain\nsemantics as \\(P \\exists x(x=a) \\wedge \\neg\\exists x(x=a)\\).\n\nIf constants are treated as rigid designators, the principle of\nNecessity of Identity \\(\\tau_1 = \\tau_2 \\rightarrow A(\\tau_1\n= \\tau_2)\\) is valid, for both variables and constants (recall that\n\\(A \\varphi = H \\varphi \\land \\varphi \\land G\\varphi\\)). However, the\nlanguage may also contain individual terms for which this principle\nfails. A core example are definite descriptions, such as\n\u201cthe Pope\u201d, which may pick out different objects at\ndifferent times. Importantly, proper names and definite descriptions\nrequire a different semantic treatment and are not freely\ninter-substitutable. For example \u201cThe Pope has been the\nsovereign of the Vatican City since 1929\u201d is true, whereas\n\u201cJorge Mario Bergoglio has been the sovereign of the Vatican\nCity since 1929\u201d is false. Moreover, in a temporal setting, the\nquestion arises how to deal with definite descriptions that refer to\nobjects that do no longer or not yet exist, such as \u201cthe first\nchild to be born in South Africa in 2050\u201d. The problems get even\nmore intricate in a branching time setting, where time and modality\nare combined. Note, for instance, that some definite descriptions that\nare temporally rigid may be modally non-rigid. For more on definite\ndescriptions in the context of temporal logic, see Rescher and\nUrquhart (1971, Chapters XIII and XX) and Cocchiarella (2002).\n\nOne way to deal with definite descriptions is to switch from an\nextensional to an intensional account of individual terms. That is,\nrather than assigning to each term at each time instant an\nextension, i.e.\u00a0an object from the domain, one may\nassign to each term an intension, i.e.\u00a0a function from\ntime instants to objects. A general framework in which individual\nterms are assigned both extensions and intensions is the Case\nIntensional First-Order Logic (CIFOL) proposed in Belnap and\nM\u00fcller (2014a; 2014b). In CIFOL, identity is\nextensional, predication is intensional, and individuals can be\nidentified across times without making use of rigid designation. The\nframework is also interesting against the background of the debate on\npersistence as it remains metaphysically neutral with respect to the\nprecise nature of the objects included in the overall domain.\n8.8 Some technical results on first-order temporal logics\n\nFirst-order temporal logics are very expressive, and this often comes\nwith a high computational price: these logics can be deductively very\ncomplex and are typically highly undecidable (cf. Merz 1992;\nGabbay et al.\u00a01994; Hodkinson et al. 2002). The first-order\ntemporal logic with constant domain semantics over the natural\nnumbers, for example, with only two variables and unary relation\nsymbols, is not only undecidable but not even recursively\naxiomatizable (cf. B\u00f6rger et al.\u00a01997; Hodkinson et al.\n2000).\n\nFew axiomatizable, and even fewer decidable, natural fragments of\nfirst-order temporal logics have been identified and investigated so\nfar. These include first-order temporal logics with Since and\nUntil over the class of all linear flows of time and over the\norder of the rationals (Merz 1992; Reynolds 1996), the fragment T(FOs) of\nFOTL, where temporal operators may not occur inside the scope of a\nquantifier (Gabbay et al.\u00a01994, Chapter 14), as well as the\nmonodic fragment, only allowing formulae with at most one free variable in the scope of a temporal operator (see Hodkinson et al.\u00a02000; 2001; 2002\nand Wolter and Zakharyaschev 2002). Still, as shown in the latter\npaper, already the monodic fragment with equality is no longer\nrecursively axiomatizable. For further decidability results for\nsuitably restricted fragments of FOTL, see Hodkinson et\nal.\u00a0(2000). Additional technical references are given in Gabbay\net al.\u00a0(1994, Chapter 14) and Kr\u00f6ger and Merz (2008). For\ncompleteness results for first-order modal logics see also Fitting and\nMendelsohn (1998) and the entry on\n modal logic.\n\nFor further philosophical discussion on first-order modal and temporal\nlogics, see Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XX); McArthur (1976);\nGarson (1984): Linsky and Zalta (1994); van Benthem (1995, Section 7);\nFitting and Mendelsohn (1998); W\u00f6lfl (1999);\nCocchiarella (2002); as well as Lindstr\u00f6m and Segerberg\n(2006).\n9. Combining temporal and other logics\n\nLogics can be used to reason about dynamically changing aspects of the\nworld, and time plays a role in many domains. For instance, the notion\nof knowledge studied in epistemic logic, the idea of an action\nunderlying logics of agency, or the physical concept of space in\nspatial logics all bear an intimate relation to time. It is therefore\nnatural to add a temporal dimension to these logics and equip the\ncorresponding languages with temporal operators that are suited to\ncapture the relevant notion of change.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, there are several ways of combining\nmodels and logical systems: products, fusions, etc. (see the entry on\n combining logics).\n These constructions provide different mechanisms for temporalizing a\nlogic and raise generic questions about transfer of logical\nproperties, such as axiomatizations, completeness, decidability.\nDecidability, for instance, is usually preserved in fusions, while it\nis often lost in products of logical systems. For a general discussion\nof temporalizing logical systems and properties of temporalized\nlogics, see Finger and Gabbay (1992; 1996); Finger et al. (2002); and\nGabbay et al. (2003). Here we only present and briefly discuss some of\nthe most popular cases of temporalized logical systems.\n9.1 Temporal-epistemic logics\n\nTemporal-epistemic logics bring together temporal logics and\n(multi-agent) logics of knowledge. Some interesting properties can\nnaturally be expressed by combining the epistemic modality \\(K\\)\n(\u201cthe agent knows that\u201d) with temporal operators, e.g.\nperfect recall: \\(K \\varphi \\to GK \\varphi\\) (If the agent\nknows \\(\\varphi\\) now, then the agent will always know \\(\\varphi\\) in\nthe future) and no learning: \\(FK \\varphi \\to K\n\\varphi\\).\n\nVarious temporal-epistemic logics were developed during the 1980s,\nwith a unifying study by Halpern and Vardi (1989). They consider a\nvariety of 96 temporal-epistemic logics on so-called interpreted\nsystems, i.e. sets of runs in a transition system with epistemic\nindistinguishability relations on the state space for each agent. The\nvariety is based on several parameters: number of agents (one\nor many), the language (with or without common knowledge),\nthe formal model of time (linear or branching time),\nrecall abilities (no recall, bounded recall, or perfect\nrecall), learning abilities (learning or no learning),\nsynchrony (synchronous or asynchronous), unique initial\nstate. Depending on the particular choice of these parameters,\nthe computational complexity of the decision problem for these logics\nranges very broadly from PSPACE-complete to highly undecidable\n(\\(\\Pi^{1}_{1}\\)-complete). For details, see Halpern and Vardi (1989);\nFagin et al. (1995); as well as the more recent van Benthem and Pacuit\n(2006), which surveys a number of decidability and undecidability\nresults for temporal-epistemic logics and illustrates how the\ncombination of time with other modalities bears on computational\ncomplexity.\n9.2 Temporal logics and logics of agency\n\nTemporal reasoning is an important aspect of reasoning about agents\nand their actions. The probably most influential family of logics of\nagency in philosophical studies is the family of so-called\nstit logics, originating from the work of Belnap and Perloff\n(1988). These logics contain formulae of the form\nstit\\(\\varphi\\), reading \u201cThe agent sees to it that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d, which allow one to reason about how an\nagent\u2019s choices to act bear on the world. The original versions\nof stit logic do not involve temporal operators.\nNevertheless, their semantics is based on Ockhamist branching time\nmodels, where an agent\u2019s set of choices at a given time instant\nis represented by a partition of the set of histories passing through\nthat instant. Intuitively, the formula stit\\(\\varphi\\) is\ntrue at a given time instant \\(t\\) with respect to a given history\n\\(h\\) iff the agent\u2019s choice at the instant \\(t\\) with respect\nto the history \\(h\\) guarantees that \\(\\varphi\\), i.e. if \\(\\varphi\\)\nis true at \\(t\\) relative to all histories in the respective choice\ncell. For a detailed discussion of varieties of stit logic\nand their historical development, see Belnap et al. (2001) and the\nentry on\n the logic of action.\n Temporal extensions of stit logics have been proposed in\nBroersen (2011) and Lorini (2013): in Broersen (2011) the\nstit operator is combined with the Next Time\noperator \\(X\\) into a single operator which requires that the\nobjective be met in the next step, whereas in Lorini (2013) the\nstit operator and the temporal operators are treated\nseparately.\n\nAnother important family of temporal logics of agency are the\nalternating-time logics ATL and ATL*, introduced in Alur et\nal. (2002). ATL and ATL* are multi-agent extensions of the computation\ntree logics CTL and CTL*, and they have become a popular logical\nframework for strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems.\nAlternating-time temporal logics enrich the language with strategic\npath quantifiers \\(\\langle\\!\\langle C \\rangle\\!\\rangle \\varphi,\\)\nintuitively saying \u201cThe coalition \\(C\\) has a collective\nstrategy to guarantee that the objective \\(\\varphi\\) is met on every\npath enabled by that collective strategy\u201d, where the objective\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a temporal formula. While stit logics build on\nthe rather abstract notion of a history, ATL and ATL* are interpreted\nover so-called concurrent game structures, in which paths are viewed\nas sequences of successor states that are generated by discrete\ntransitions caused by collective actions of all agents. A combination\nof ATL and stit theory was developed in Broersen et al.\n(2006). The branching time logics CTL and CTL* can be regarded as\nsingle-agent versions of ATL and ATL*. Even though the latter are\nquite more expressive, they generally preserve the good computational\nproperties of the former. For further details, see Alur et al. (2002),\nas well as Goranko and van Drimmelen (2006), where a complete\naxiomatization and decidability results for ATL are established. A\ngeneral introduction to ATL from a temporal logic perspective is\nprovided in Demri et al. (2016, Chapter 9).\n9.3 Spatial-temporal logics\n\nSpace and time are intimately related in the physical world, and they\nhave become inseparable in modern physical theories. While early\nphysical theories, culminating in Newton\u2019s classical mechanics,\npresuppose an absolute notion of time independent from space,\nEinstein\u2019s relativity theory views time and space as\ninextricably interwoven, as modeled by Minkowski\u2019s\nfour-dimensional space-time manifold.\n\nCombined logical reasoning about space-time is discussed in Rescher\nand Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVI). In Goldblatt (1980), the Diodorean\nmodal logic of Minkowski space-time was studied and proved to be\nexactly the modal logic D4.2; further results are provided in Uckelman\nand Uckelman (2007). Logical investigations into relativity theory\nhave been conducted as well, see e.g. Andr\u00e9ka et al.\n(2007).\n\nIn Artificial Intelligence, space-time reasoning has been actively\nevolving over the past decades, particularly in the context of\nspatio-temporal databases, ontologies, and constraint networks. The\nmain focus here is on the logical characterization of spatio-temporal\nmodels, expressiveness, and computational complexity (Gabelaia et al.\n2005; Kontchakov et al. 2007).\n\nAnother interesting line of research is triggered by the theory of\nbranching space-times developed in Belnap (1992). This theory relates\nto space-time just as Prior\u2019s theory of branching time relates\nto linear time; that is, it combines space-time reasoning with\nindeterminism. See e.g. M\u00fcller (2013) and Placek (2014), where\nthe topology of branching space-times is studied against the\nbackground of relativity theory. An extensive overview of branching space-times can be found in Belnap et al. (2022).\n9.4 Temporal description logics\n\nDescription logics are essentially variations of modal logics. They\ninvolve concepts (unary predicates) and roles\n(binary predicates) and are used to describe various ontologies and\nthe relations between the concepts in them (see e.g. Baader and Lutz\n2006). Description logics can be temporalized in various ways. For\ndetails, see Artale and Franconi (2000); Wolter and Zakharyaschev\n(2000); and Lutz et al. (2008).\n9.5 Temporal logics and other non-classical logics\n\nTemporal reasoning can naturally be combined with various\nnon-classical logical systems, resulting, for instance, in many-valued\ntemporal logics (Rescher and Urquhart 1971, Chapter XVIII),\nintuitionistic temporal logics (Ewald 1986), constructive and\nparaconsistent temporal logics (Kamide and Wansing 2010; 2011),\nprobabilistic temporal logics (Hart and Sharir 1986; Konur 2013),\netc.\n10. Logical deduction and decision methods for temporal logics\n\nExtensive research and numerous publications over the past 50 years\nhave developed a variety of logical deduction systems and decision\nmethods for the temporal logics mentioned here and many more.\nHilbert style axiomatic systems are the most common logical\ndeduction systems for temporal logics, but many complete systems of\nsemantic tableaux, sequent calculi, and\nresolution-based systems have been proposed as well. Some\ngeneral references on deductive systems for temporal logics (in\naddition to the more specific references mentioned elsewhere in this\ntext) include: Rescher and Urquhart (1971); McArthur (1976); Burgess\n(1984); Emerson (1990); Goldblatt (1992); Gabbay et al. (1994); van\nBenthem (1995); Bolc and Szalas (1995); Gabbay and Guenthner (2002);\nGabbay et al. (2003); Fisher et al. (2005); Blackburn et al. (2006);\nBaier and Katoen (2008); Kr\u00f6ger and Merz (2008); Fisher (2011);\nDemri et al. (2016).\n\nOne of the most important logical decision problems is to determine\nwhether a given formula of a given logic is valid (resp. satisfiable)\nin the semantics provided for that logic. Particularly efficient and\npractically useful for deciding satisfiability are the\ntableaux-based methods, originating from pioneering work of\nBeth, Hintikka, Smullyan, and Fitting. These methods are based on a\nsystematic search of a satisfying model (resp. falsifying countermodel)\nif an input formula that is tested for satisfiability is provided, and\nthey are guaranteed to find such a model whenever it exists.\nTableaux-based methods have been successfully developed for\nconstructive satisfiability testing for a variety of temporal logics.\nSee Gor\u00e9 (1999) for a survey on tableaux systems for many\ntemporal logics and more specifically: Ben-Ari et al. (1983) for the\nbranching time logic UB; Emerson and Halpern (1985) for the\ncomputation tree logic CTL; Wolper (1985) for the linear time temporal\nlogic LTL; Kontchakov et al. (2004) on temporalizing tableaux;\nReynolds (2007) for CTL with bundled tree semantics; Goranko and\nShkatov (2010) for ATL; Reynolds (2011) for the full computation tree\nlogic CTL*; Reynolds (2014) for the real-time temporal logic RTL,\netc.\n\nOther methods that have proven practically fruitful for deciding\nsatisfiability as well as for model checking of temporal logics in\ncomputer science are the automata-based methods, which have\nbeen actively developing since the early 1990s. These methods\ntransform temporal formulae into automata on infinite words (for\nlinear time logics) or infinite trees (for branching time logics) and\nrepresent models for the logics as input objects (infinite words or\ntrees) for their associated automata. Thus, satisfiability of a\nformula becomes equivalent to the language of the associated automaton\nbeing non-empty. The methods are based on classical results about\ndecidability of the monadic second-order theories of the natural\nnumbers (by B\u00fcchi) and of the infinite binary tree (by Rabin).\nFor instance, in Emerson and Sistla (1984), automata on infinite trees\nand Rabin\u2019s theorem were used to obtain a decision procedure for\nCTL*. For further details see Vardi (2006).\n\nImportant references on decidability results and decision procedures\nfor various temporal logics include: Burgess (1980) and Gurevich and\nShelah (1985) for branching time logics; Burgess and Gurevich (1985)\nfor linear temporal logics; Goldblatt (1992) for both linear and\nbranching time logics; Montanari and Policriti (1996) for metric and\nlayered temporal logics; French (2001) for some quantified\npropositional branching time logics.\n\nWhile most propositional temporal logics are decidable, adding some\nsyntactic or semantic features can make them explode computationally\nand become undecidable. The most common causes of undecidability of\ntemporal logics, besides combinations with other expressive logics,\ninclude: grid-like models; temporal operators along multiple time-lines;\nproducts of temporal logics; interval-based logics with no locality\nassumptions; time reference mechanisms, such as hybrid reference pointers and freeze quantifiers; arithmetic features, such as time addition,\nexact time constraints, etc. However, there are various ways to tame\ntemporal logics and restore decidability, such as adding syntactic and\nparametric restrictions (e.g. on the number of propositional variables\nor the depth of nesting), imposing suitable semantic restrictions\n(e.g. locality for interval logics), identifying decidable fragments\n(e.g. the two-variable fragment FO\\(^{2}\\) of classical first-order\nlogic, guarded fragments, monodic fragments), etc.\n11. Applications of temporal logics\n\nTemporal logic is a field whose development has been heavily driven by\nphilosophical considerations. At the same time, the logical formalisms\nand technical systems developed over the years have found application\nin various different disciplines, ranging from computer science,\nartificial intelligence, and linguistics, to natural, cognitive, and\nsocial sciences. In this section, we briefly discuss some pertinent\napplications of temporal logics in computer science, artificial\nintelligence, and linguistics.\n11.1 Temporal logics in Computer Science\n\nThe idea to apply temporal reasoning to the analysis of deterministic\nand stochastic transition systems was already present in the theory of\nprocesses and events in Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XIV).\nHowever, it was with the seminal paper of Pnueli (1977) that temporal\nlogic became really prominent in computer science. Pnueli proposed the\napplication of temporal logics to the specification and verification\nof reactive and concurrent programs and systems. In order to\nensure correct behavior of a reactive program, in which computations\nare non-terminating (e.g. an operating system), it is necessary to\nformally specify and verify the acceptable infinite executions of that\nprogram. In addition, to ensure correctness of a concurrent program,\nwhere two or more processors are working in parallel, it is necessary\nto formally specify and verify their interaction and\nsynchronization.\n\nKey properties of infinite computations that can be captured by\ntemporal patterns are liveness, safety, and fairness (see Manna and\nPnueli 1992):\n\nLiveness properties or eventualities involve\ntemporal patterns of the forms \\(F{p},\\) \\(q \\to F {p},\\) or \\(G(q \\to\nF {p}),\\) which ensure that if a specific precondition (\\(q\\)) is\ninitially satisfied, then a desirable state (satisfying \\(p\\)) will\neventually be reached in the course of the computation. Examples are\n\u201cIf a message is sent, it will eventually be delivered\u201d\nand \u201cWhenever a printing job is activated, it will eventually be\ncompleted\u201d.\nSafety or invariance properties involve temporal\npatterns of the forms \\({G} {p},\\) \\(q \\to {G} {p},\\) or \\(G(q \\to {G}\n{p}),\\) which ensure that if a specific precondition (\\(q\\)) is\ninitially satisfied, then undesirable states (violating the safety\ncondition \\(p\\)) will never occur. Examples are: \u201cNo more than\none process will be in its critical section at any moment of\ntime\u201d, \u201cA resource will never be used by two or more\nprocesses simultaneously\u201d, or, to give more practical examples:\n\u201cThe traffic lights will never show green in both\ndirections\u201d, \u201cA train will never pass a red\nsemaphore\u201d.\nFairness properties involve combinations of temporal\npatterns of the forms \\({GF} {p}\\) (\u201cinfinitely often\n\\(p\\)\u201d) or \\({FG} {p}\\) (\u201ceventually always \\(p\\)\u201d).\nIntuitively, fairness requires that whenever several processes that\nshare resources are run concurrently, they must be treated\n\u2018fairly\u2019 by the operating system, scheduler, etc. A\ntypical fairness requirement says that if a process is persistent\nenough in sending a request (e.g. keeps sending it over and over\nagain), its request will eventually be granted.\n\n\nAn infinite computation is formally represented by a model of the\nlinear time temporal logic LTL. Non-deterministic systems are modeled\nby branching time structures. Thus, both LTL and the computation tree\nlogics CTL and CTL* have been very important for specification and\nverification of reactive and concurrent systems.\n\nThe following example combines liveness and safety properties of a\nsingle computation: \u201cWhenever a state of alert is reached, the\nalarm is activated and remains activated until a safe state is\neventually reached\u201d. This property is expressible in LTL as\n\n\\[\n G(\\textsf{alert} \\to (\\textsf{alarm} \\ U\\ \\textsf{safe})).\n\\]\n\n\nAnother example, referring to all computations in the system, is:\n\u201cIf the process \\(\\sigma\\) is eventually enabled on some\ncomputation starting from the current state, then on every computation\nstarting there, whenever \\(\\sigma\\) is enabled, it will remain enabled\nuntil the process \\(\\tau\\) is disabled\u201d. This property can be\nformalized in CTL* as \n\n\\[ \n\\Diamond F\\,\\textsf{enabled}_{\\sigma} \\to \\Box\nG(\\textsf{enabled}_{\\sigma} \\to (\\textsf{enabled}_{\\sigma} \\,U\\,\n\\textsf{disabled}_{\\tau})).  \n\\]\n\n\nA variation of LTL with useful applications for specifying and\nreasoning about concurrent systems is Lamport\u2019s (1994)\ntemporal logic of actions TLA. Other applications of temporal\nlogics in computer science include: temporal databases, real-time\nprocesses and systems, hardware verification, etc. Further information\non such applications can be found in e.g. Pnueli (1977); Emerson and\nClarke (1982); Moszkowski (1983); Galton (1987); Emerson (1990); Alur\nand Henzinger (1992); Lamport (1994); Vardi and Wolper (1994); Bolc\nand Szalas (1995); Gabbay et al. (2000); Baier and Katoen (2008);\nKr\u00f6ger and Merz (2008); Fisher (2011); Demri et al. (2016).\n11.2 Temporal logics in Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major areas of application\nof temporal logics. Relating temporal reasoning to AI was suggested\nalready in the early philosophical discussion on AI by McCarthy and\nHayes (1969), the theory of processes and events in Rescher and\nUrquhart (1971, Chapter XIV), and the period-based theories of Hamblin\n(1972); see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995) for an overview of\nthese early developments. In the 1980s, temporal representation and\nreasoning gradually became an increasingly prominent theme in AI with\nseveral influential works, including McDermott\u2019s temporal logic\nfor reasoning about processes and plans (McDermott 1982);\nAllen\u2019s general theory of action and time (Allen 1984); the\nEvent Calculus of Kowalski and Sergot (1986); the reified temporal\nlogic by Shoham (1987); the logic of time representation by Ladkin\n(1987); and the work on temporal database management by Dean and\nMcDermott (1987). Galton (1987) provides a systematic account of these\nand other important developments in that period; see also Vila (1994)\nand Pani and Bhattacharjee (2001) for comprehensive reviews.\nInfluential works in the 1990s include the introduction of\ninterval-based temporal logics by Halpern and Shoham (1991) and by\nAllen and Ferguson (1994), with representation of actions and events;\nthe Situation Calculus of Pinto and Reiter (1995); and Lamport\u2019s\nAction Theory (Lamport 1994), etc. Further important developments\nrelating temporal reasoning and AI since then include: temporal\nreasoning in natural language, temporal ontologies, temporal databases\nand constraint solving, temporal planning, executable temporal logics,\nspatial-temporal reasoning, temporal reasoning in agent-based systems,\netc. The field has gradually grown so rich and broad \u2014 as\nwitnessed by the 20-chapter handbook edited by Fisher et al. (2005)\n\u2014 that it is impossible to even briefly survey it here, so we\nonly bookmark a few of the main issues of philosophical relevance that\nhave been in the focus of temporal reasoning and logics in AI.\n\nThe prevailing logical approach to temporal representation and\nreasoning in AI, especially in the 1980s-1990s, has traditionally been\nbased on temporalized variations of first-order logic rather than on\nPrior-style temporal logic. The approach is best illustrated by the\nso-called method of temporal arguments (McCarthy and Hayes\n1969; Shoham 1987; Vila 1994). According to this method, the temporal\ndimension is captured by augmenting propositions and predicates with\n\u2018time stamp\u2019 arguments, as for example \u201cPublish(A.\nPrior, Time and Modality, 1957)\u201d. An alternative, yet\nclosely related approach, is the one of reified temporal\nlogics (McDermott 1982; Allen 1984; Shoham 1987; see Ma and\nKnight 2001 for a survey). This approach makes use of reifying\nmeta-predicates, such as \u2018TRUE\u2019 and \u2018FALSE\u2019,\nbut also \u2018HOLDS\u2019, \u2018OCCURS\u2019,\n\u2018BEFORE\u2019, \u2018AFTER\u2019, interval relations such as\n\u2018MEETS\u2019, \u2018OVERLAPS\u2019, etc., which are applied\nto propositions of some standard logical language (e.g. classical\nfirst-order logic). An example of a reified expression is\n\u201cOCCUR(Born(A. Prior), 1914)\u201d. Associated with theories of\ntime are theories of temporal incidence (cf. Vila 2005).\nStill, the prominence of the modal logic based approach has always\nbeen strong, and it has more recently resurged, e.g. in the context of\nagent-based temporal reasoning (cf. Fisher and Wooldridge 2005).\nTheories of temporal reasoning in AI distinguish between\nfluents, which are propositions describing states of the\nworld that may change over time, and events, representing\nwhat happens in the world and causes changes between states.\nPhilosophical issues arising here concern the nature of fluents and\nevents, the meaning of instantaneous events, the distinction between\nhomogeneous states and inhomogeneous events, the dividing instant\nproblem, the frame problem, etc. For further discussion,\nsee Shoham (1987); Galton (1990); and Vila (2005). See also the\nrelated discussion on reasoning about action and change in Section 4\nof the entry on\n logic and artificial intelligence.\nBoth fluents and events can be considered in discrete or\ncontinuous time and they can be instantaneous or durational. This\nkeeps the debate on instant-based versus\ninterval-based formal models of time alive, with various\ntheories following and comparing both approaches, including van\nBenthem (1983); Allen (1983); Allen and Hayes (1989); Allen and\nFerguson (1994); Galton (1995); Vila (2005); etc. \n\n\nFor further reading and discussion on temporal reasoning and logics in\nAI, see Vila (1994); Galton (1995); the comprehensive handbook Fisher\net al. (2005); and the more concise handbook chapter Fisher\n(2008).\n11.3 Temporal logics in Linguistics\n\nTense is an important feature of natural languages. It is a linguistic\ndevice that allows one to specify the relative location of events in\ntime, usually with respect to the speech time. In most languages,\nincluding English, tense becomes manifest in a system of different\nverbal tenses. English allows for a distinction between past, present,\nand future tense (\u2018will\u2019 future) and, traditionally, the\nrespective perfect and progressive forms are referred to as tenses as\nwell.\n\nAs laid out above, Prior\u2019s invention of tense logic was largely\nmotivated by the use of tense in natural language. An alternative\nearly logical approach to tense was provided by Reichenbach (1947),\nwho suggested an analysis of the English verbal tenses in terms of\nthree points in time: speech time, event time, and reference time,\nwhere the reference time is a contextually salient point in time,\nwhich, intuitively, captures the perspective from which the event is\nviewed. Using the notion of reference time, Reichenbach was able to\ndistinguish, for example, between the simple past (\u201cI wrote a\nletter\u201d) and the present perfect (\u201cI have written a\nletter\u201d), which are conflated in Prior\u2019s account. In both\ncases, of simple past and of present perfect, the event time precedes\nthe speech time; but, in the former case the reference time coincides\nwith the event time whereas in the latter case the reference time is\nsimultaneous with the speech time.\n\nNeither Prior\u2019s nor Reichenbach\u2019s frameworks can account\nfor the difference between, for instance, the simple past (\u201cI\nwrote a letter\u201d) and the past progressive (\u201cI was writing\na letter\u201d). The relevant distinction here is one of aspect\nrather than of tense and naturally requires an interval-based or\nevent-based setting to be adequately dealt with. For accounts along\nthese lines, see e.g. Dowty (1979); Parsons (1980); Galton (1984); and\nvan Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).\n\nWhereas Reichenbach\u2019s analysis makes reference to a contextually\nsalient point in time, on Prior\u2019s account tenses are construed\nas temporal operators, which are interpreted as quantifiers over\ninstants in time. This raises the general question: are tenses in\nnatural language to be treated as quantifiers, or do they refer to\nspecific points in time? In an influential paper, Partee (1973)\nprovided the following counterexample against a quantifier treatment\nof tenses: the sentence \u201cI didn\u2019t turn off the\nstove\u201d means neither (1) there is an earlier time instant at\nwhich I do not turn off the stove, nor does it mean (2) there is no\nearlier instant at which I turn off the stove. The first requirement\nis too weak, the second too strong. Partee suggested an analogy\nbetween tenses and referential pronouns. According to this proposal,\ntenses refer to specific, contextually given points in time (e.g. 8\no\u2019clock this morning), which are presupposed to stand in\nappropriate temporal relations to the speech time. Subsequently,\naccounts that restrict quantification to a contextually given time\ninterval (e.g. this morning) have become popular. On these accounts,\nPartee\u2019s example sentence has the intuitive meaning: there is no\nearlier time instant in the contextually salient time interval at\nwhich I turn off the stove. Formally, this idea is compatible with\nboth a quantifier and a referential treatment of tenses; for details\nsee Kuhn and Portner (2002) and Ogihara (2011).\n\nOther pertinent issues in linguistics relating to time concern the\nmeaning of temporal adverbs and connectives, the interaction of tense\nand quantification, the interpretation of embedded tenses and sequence\nof tense, as well as the interrelation of tense and modality. For an\noverview and further discussion on the application of temporal logics\nin linguistics, see e.g. Steedman (1997); Kuhn and Portner (2002);\nMani et al. (2005); ter Meulen (2005); Moss and Tiede (2006); Ogihara\n(2007; 2011); Dyke (2013); and the entry on\n tense and aspect.\n",
