    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics || Plural(l)ism\n3.3 Plural(l)ism\n\n\nIn the current philosophical landscape, there are many different forms\nof pluralism on offer. For instance, there is an\nontological form of pluralism (there are different ways of\nbeing), truth pluralism (there are different ways of being\ntrue), and there is a logical form of pluralism (there is\nmore than one correct logic; see the entry on logical\npluralism). However, it is almost universally assumed, if mostly\nunstated, that there can be no pluralism about the actual\nworld\u2014this one is the only\nactual one. As should appear clear from this entry, though,\nSylvan was accustomed to challenging the philosophical consensus. He\nbegan by attacking classical logic, he continued by questioning the\nso-called Ontological Assumption and, late in his career, he decided to\nchallenge what he calls one-world-ism, that is, the idea that\nthere is only one actual world.\n\n\nSylvan argues that there is a plurality of actual worlds we all live\nin. In his Transcendental Metaphysics (1997) he claims:\n\n\nA theme, to be defended at length, is that while there is\nan actual world, which is suitably external,\nmind-independent, perceiver-independent, and the like, it is not\nunique. There are many actual worlds. That theme is bound to\nstrike others, as it still occasionally strikes me momentarily, as\nutterly outrageous. [My] work and arguments are designed to remove\nthis misconception (1997, 4).\n\n\nIn order to draw a clear distinction between his pluralism and the\nothers, he refers to his own theory with a neologism:\nplurallism. The aims of such a theory are summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe overarching themes of plurallism are (\u2026): (1) There is\nno unique world. There is no unique actual universe; (2)\nThere is no one unalterable truth; no single Way of Truth; (3)\nThere is no single correct Scientific Theory (1997,\n4).\n\n\nIn order to support these ideas, Sylvan presents two sets of\narguments.\n\n\nSylvan argues indirectly there is a lack of (good) arguments\nin favour of the uniqueness of the actual world. From the fact that\nthere is such a thing as an actual world it does not necessarily\nfollow that such a world is unique, nor is its uniqueness observable\n(cf. 1997, 54\u201360).\n\n\nOn the other hand, he directly supports plurallism by arguing\nthat for each area of research, there is (or there could be) a\nplurality of correct theories. His reasoning goes as follows. All\ntheories are grounded on logic because logic is necessary for\nreasoning about both the data used by those theories and the theories\nthemselves. And, if there is, not just one, but a plurality of\ncorrect logics, there is (or there could be) a plurality of\ncorrect theories which spring from all those different, but all\nequally acceptable, ways of reasoning as well (cf. 1997,\n61\u201374). From this, a plurality of actual worlds follows if we\naccept two enthymematic assumptions. The first one is that any correct\nlogic, in virtue of its being correct, properly describes an actual\nworld. If so, if there is more than one correct logic, there is more\nthan one actual world too. The second assumption, then, is that there\nare many correct logics. This idea was not shared by Sylvan\u2019s\ncontemporaries but one that he came to defend late in his career,\nclaiming (1997, xix) \u201cthat not merely is there a plurality of\nlogics, but there is also [a plurality] of correct logics\u201d. The\nidea is elaborated on in Sylvan (1997, ch. 4) and is now widely\ndiscussed in the literature (see, for instance, Beall and Restall\n2000; Russell 2008; Weber 2017b). Sylvan claims that phenomenological\ndata seems to support plurallism as well (cf. 1997,\n118\u2013133).\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s motivations for developing plurallism are not uniquely\nphilosophical. On the contrary, he believes that the existence of the\nplurality of actual worlds can have important political consequences\ntoo. One of those consequences is the extension and strengthening of\nour idea of tolerance. According to Sylvan, intolerant behaviours are\noften, if not always, grounded on ideologies driven by what he calls\nthe \u201cone-true-way\u201d (1997, 462) or the\n\u201cone-admissible-way\u201d (1997, 462). Governments,\nreligious groups, and even scientists believe that \u201ctruth should\nbe imposed\u201d (1997, 462) where truth is what is uniquely\ndetermined by them. Plurallism invites us to entertain the idea that,\nas there is no such thing as a unique actual world, there is no such\nthing as a unique truth. And this should undermine the ideological\nroots of intolerant behaviours.\n",
