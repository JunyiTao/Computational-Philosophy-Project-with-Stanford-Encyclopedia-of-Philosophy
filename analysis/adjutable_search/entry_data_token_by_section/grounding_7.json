    "main_text": "The Nature of Grounding || Objectivity and representation\n2.1 Objectivity and representation\n\nWhat are the central features of grounding? Grounding theorists\nroutinely claim that grounding is fully objective. But, given that\nobjectivity and related notions are used in a variety of ways in\nphilosophy, it comes as no surprise that there are different ways of\nunderstanding precisely what is being claimed here. On one approach,\nthe issue chiefly concerns the regimentation of grounding discourse.\nIf grounding claims are to be formulated with a parameter for facts\nconcerning human mental activity, then grounding isn\u2019t fully\nobjective (Dasgupta 2017). On a more \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\napproach, the issue instead chiefly concerns the essence or nature of\ngrounding, specifically whether grounding is essentially connected to\nsubjects. Suppose, for example, that part of what it is to be\ngrounding is that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\) only if\ncertain epistemic conditions obtain (e.g., actual subjects are in a\nposition to understand certain propositions concerning \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 and \\([Q]\\)). In this case, grounding isn\u2019t\nobjective.\n\nWhat might speak in favor of objectivism about grounding? Perhaps our\nconsidered views about causation should guide our theorizing about\ngrounding (cf. Bernstein 2015). Schaffer (2016a) conceives of\ngrounding as being broadly analogous to causation and proposes to\nextend the familiar structural equation models for causation to\ngrounding. And A. Wilson (2018) argues that grounding is indeed a type\nof causation, proposing an interventionist account of grounding. So,\nprovided that it\u2019s a bad idea to outfit causal claims with a\nparameter for facts concerning human mental activity, this is probably\na bad idea for grounding claims as well (cf. Bernstein 2018).\nSubjectivism (the claim that, while some facts ground other facts,\ngrounding isn\u2019t fully objective), however, isn\u2019t beyond\nthe pale. One potential route to subjectivism is this: endorse\nunionism (grounding is explanationG) and argue\nthat explanationG is by its nature subject\ninvolving (Maurin 2019; Thompson 2018).\n\nRoughly speaking, the representational approach to grounding\nhas it that grounding is intimately tied to representation (Fine\n2012a; Rosen 2010), while the worldly approach denies this\n(Audi 2012b; Schaffer 2012). While the representational/worldly\ndistinction is somewhat hazy, we understand it to be orthogonal to the\nobjective/subjective distinction. One way to sharpen the distinction\nbetween the representational and worldly approaches is as follows: on\nthe former, the relata of grounding have concepts among their\nconstituents; on the latter, this isn\u2019t the case (Kr\u00e4mer\n& Roski 2015; Correia 2017). So understood, the representational\napproach comes in two varieties: either facts are composed entirely of\nconcepts or they\u2019re a mixture of concepts and\nnon-representational items like objects and properties. On the former\nview, facts are akin to Fregean propositions; on the latter view,\nthey\u2019re instead akin to ordered sets of concepts and\nnon-representational items. (See Correia 2010 for a discussion of the\ndistinction between the representational and worldly approaches where\nit isn\u2019t assumed that grounding is a relation.)\n\nWhat hinges on whether grounding is representational or worldly? This\nisn\u2019t entirely clear. You might think that grounding being\nworldly ensures that the relata of grounding are relatively\ncoarse-grained, and grounding being representational ensures that the\nrelata of grounding are relatively fine-grained. Consider the\nfollowing two facts: [The liquid is H2O] and [The liquid is\nwater]. Representationalists, so the thinking goes, might claim that\nwe have distinct facts here, as they have different concepts as\nconstituents. And proponents of the worldly approach might claim that\nwe have only one fact here, as there is no difference in constituents\nor manner of combination. And this, of course, is potentially relevant\nto theorizing about grounding\u2014if [The liquid is H2O]\nand [The liquid is water] are the same fact, then the claim that the\nformer grounds the latter or vice versa is false provided that\ngrounding is irreflexive (see\n \u00a72.3).\n Note, however, that representationalists can coherently maintain that\nfacts are relatively coarse-grained\u2014perhaps they think that,\nwhile facts are Fregean propositions, concepts are relatively\ncoarse-grained (Correia 2020). And proponents of the worldly approach\ncan coherently maintain that facts are relatively\nfine-grained\u2014perhaps they think that, while facts are true\nRussellian propositions (ordered sets of non-representational items\nincluding properties), properties are relatively fine-grained (Dorsey\n2015).\n\nYou might also think that if grounding is worldly then unionism is\nfalse. The idea is that, if grounding is worldly, then grounding\ncan\u2019t be a type of explanation, as explanation itself is\nrepresentational. There are, however, conceptions of explanation\nrelative to which explanation is non-representational, and a worldly\nunionist is free to appeal to explanation so conceived (Skiles and\nTrogdon 2021).\n",
