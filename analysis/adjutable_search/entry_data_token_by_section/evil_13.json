    "main_text": "Attempted Total Refutations || The Appeal to the Ontological Argument\n5.3 The Appeal to the Ontological Argument\n\nA final way in which one could attempt to show that facts about evil\ncannot constitute even prima facie evidence against the\nexistence of God is by appealing to the ontological\nargument. Relatively few philosophers have held, of course, that the\nontological argument is sound. But there have certainly been notable\nexceptions\u2014such as Anselm and Descartes, and, in the last\ncentury, Charles Hartshorne (1962), Norman Malcolm (1960), and Alvin\nPlantinga (1974a, 1974b)\n\nIf the ontological argument were sound, it would provide a rather\ndecisive refutation of the argument from evil. For in showing not\nmerely that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect\nbeing, but also that it is necessary that such a being exists, it would\nentail that the proposition that God does not exist must have\nprobability zero on any body of evidence whatever.\n The only question, accordingly, is whether the ontological\nargument is sound. The vast majority of present-day philosophers\nbelieve that it is not, and one way of arguing for that view is by\nappealing to strengthened Gaunilo-type objections\u2014where the idea\nbehind a strengthened Gaunilo-type objection is that, rather than\nmerely paralleling the ontological argument, as Gaunilo did in responding to\nAnselm, in order to show that there is an overpopulation problem for\nreality in the form of perfect islands, perfect unicorns, and so on,\none can instead construct versions that lead to mutually incompatible\nconclusions, such as the conclusion that there is a perfect solvent,\ntogether with the conclusion that there is a perfectly insoluble\nsubstance (Tooley, 1981). But if the logical form of the ontological\nargument is such that arguments of precisely the same form generate\ncontradictions, then the ontological argument must be unsound.\n A more satisfying response to the ontological argument would, of\ncourse, show not merely that the ontological argument is unsound, but\nalso precisely why it is unsound. Such a response, however, requires a\nsatisfactory account of the truth conditions of modal\nstatements\u2014something that lies outside the scope of this\narticle\n",
