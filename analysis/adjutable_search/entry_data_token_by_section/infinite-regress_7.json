    "main_text": "Transmissive and Non-Transmissive Explanations\n5. Transmissive and Non-Transmissive Explanations\n\nIn section 3 we considered the suggestion that if the explanation of\nthe \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) appeals to another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\),\nand so on ad infinitum, then while the \\(F\\)-ness of each\nindividual \\(X\\) can be accounted for, something is left unexplained:\nwhy there are things that are \\(F\\) at all. But arguably, not every\ninfinite regress leaves even this global fact unexplained.\n\nTo say merely that the \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) is explained by appeal\nto another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\) leaves open a crucial question: does\nthe \\(F\\)-ness of the new \\(X\\) play a role in the explanation of the\n\\(F\\)-ness of the initial \\(X\\)? Following Bob Hale (2002),\nlet\u2019s distinguish between transmissive explanations of\n\\(F\\)-ness, in which the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_2\\) plays a crucial role in\nexplaining the fact that \\(X_1\\) is \\(F\\), the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_3\\)\nplays a crucial role in explaining the fact that \\(X_2\\) is \\(F\\), and\nso on, from non-transmissive explanations of \\(F\\)-ness, in\nwhich the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_1\\) is explained by facts concerning\n\\(X_2\\), which is in fact \\(F\\), but where the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_2\\)\nis not crucial to explaining the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_1\\), and so on.\nArguably an infinite regress of transmissive explanations of\n\\(F\\)-ness leaves unexplained why anything is \\(F\\) in the first\nplace, but an infinite regress of non-transmissive explanations need\nnot.\n\nSimon Blackburn (1986) argued that any realist attempt to explain why\nthere is necessity in the world would fail because it faced a dilemma.\nSuppose we say that \\(A\\) is necessary because \\(B\\). \\(B\\) at least\nhas to be true, but is \\(B\\) itself necessary? Blackburn thought we\ncould not answer no, because to explain the necessity of a necessary\ntruth \\(A\\) by appeal to a contingent truth would undermine the\nnecessity of \\(A\\). But to answer yes is to invite regress, for now we\nneed to explain the necessity of \\(B\\) by appeal to a necessary truth\n\\(C\\), and so on ad infinitum. Now, whether the contingency\nhorn is indeed vicious is debatable (see Hale 2002 and Cameron 2010\nfor discussion), but focus on the regress involved in the necessity\nhorn. Hale (2002) argues that the realist about necessity can resist\ngetting into a vicious regress by distinguishing between transmissive\nand non-transmissive explanations of the necessity of any given\nproposition. Grant that the necessity of \\(A\\) can only be explained\nby a proposition, \\(B\\), that is itself necessary: that explanation\nwill be transmissive if the necessity of \\(B\\) plays a role\nin explaining the necessity of \\(A\\), otherwise it will be\nnon-transmissive. Hale (ibid., 308\u2013309) offers as an\nexample of a transmissive explanation of the necessity of \\(A\\) a\nproof of \\(A\\) with the necessary truth \\(B\\) as its sole premise. If\n\\(A\\) follows logically from a necessary truth, then \\(A\\) itself must\nbe necessary. And in this case, the necessity of \\(B\\) plays a crucial\nrole in the explanation, for if I do not know whether \\(B\\) is\nnecessary, knowing that it entails \\(A\\) does not tell me whether\n\\(A\\) is necessary, for a contingent proposition can follow from\nanother contingent proposition. In that case, \\(A\\)\u2019s necessity\nseems to be hostage to \\(B\\)\u2019s necessity, and so the ultimate\nexplanation of \\(A\\)\u2019s necessity will seemingly involve whatever\nexplains \\(B\\)\u2019s necessity, which is where Blackburn senses\nregress. But Hale thinks there can also be non-transmissive\nexplanations of necessity. He suggests: \u2018Necessarily the\nconjunction of two propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is true only if \\(A\\)\nis true and \\(B\\) is true\u2019 because \u2018conjunction just is\nthat binary function of propositions which is true iff both its\narguments are true\u2019 (ibid., 312). While he grants that the\nexplanans in this case is necessary, Hale thinks that its\nnecessity is no part of the explanation. All that is needed to explain\nwhy it is necessary that \\(A \\amp B\\) is true only if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare both true is the truth of the fact that conjunction just\nis that function which is true iff both its arguments are true. It may\nbe necessary the conjunction is that function, but that is not part of\nthe explanation of the original necessity, and thus the necessity of\nthe explanans is not appealed to in a way that makes the success of\nthe explanation dependent now on explaining this further necessity.\nPerhaps there is a new question to be asked concerning why this\nfurther claim is necessary, but our original explanation stands\nindependently of whether we can successfully answer this new\nquestion.\n\nAnother example. Epistemic Infinitists embrace the infinite regress of\nreasons and argue that it is not vicious (see, e.g., Aikin 2005, 2011,\nKlein 1998, 2003, Peijnenburg 2007 and Atkinson & Peijnenburg\n2017). One response for the Infinitist to make to the regress argument\nis the response from section 3: to hold that each belief is justified\nin virtue of the next one being justified, but to claim that this is\nnot a problem: that while the regress means we do not have an\nexplanation for why anything is justified in the first place, this is\nnot what the sequence was meant to explain\u2014all that we\nneed is an explanation for each belief concerning why it is\njustified, and this we have. (See e.g., Aikin 2005, 197 and Klein\n2003, 727\u2013729.)\n\nHowever, the Infinitist may also simply deny that anything remains\nunexplained in such a regress. Peter Klein (1998, 2003) holds not only\nthat there can be an infinite regress of justifications, but\nindeed that it is necessary for \\(S\\) to be justified in\nbelieving that \\(p\\) that \\(S\\) have available to them an infinite\nnumber of propositions such that the first of these, \\(r_1\\), is a\nreason for \\(p\\), the second, \\(r_2\\), is a reason for \\(r_1\\), the\nthird, \\(r_3\\), is a reason for \\(r_2\\), and so on ad\ninfinitum. The regress objection seems to presuppose that \\(r_1\\)\nis a reason for \\(p\\) in virtue of (at least in part) \\(r_2\\)\nbeing a reason for \\(r_1\\), etc. (See e.g., Gillett 2003, 713.) In\nwhich case, so the objection goes, the justificatory chain could not\nget off the ground, and nothing would be justified. But Klein (2003,\n720\u2013723) denies that \\(r_1\\) is a reason for \\(p\\) in virtue\nof \\(r_2\\) being a reason for \\(r_1\\). There must be a\nreason, \\(r_2\\), for \\(r_1\\), and there must be a distinct\nreason for \\(r_2\\), \\(r_3\\), and so on. Each of these infinitely many\npropositions are justified, but each one\u2019s being justified, says\nKlein, does not hold in virtue of any other being justified.\nThe Infinitist demands that there is an infinite justificatory\nsequence, but that in itself is silent as to what justification\nconsists in. The Infinitist can simply hold that there is\nsome feature \\(F\\) such that for \\(x\\) to be a reason for \\(y\\),\n\\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) has to have \\(F\\), and that \\(\\langle r_1,p\n\\rangle\\) has \\(F\\), and \\(\\langle r_2,r_1 \\rangle\\) has \\(F\\), and so\non. That feature could be the first element increasing the objective\nprobability of the second, or something else entirely (ibid., 722).\nThe point is, it needn\u2019t involve the second element itself being\njustified, and thus the Infinitist need not accept that the\njustification of \\(p\\) from \\(r_1\\) is inherited from the\njustification of \\(r_1\\) from \\(r_2\\), and so on. In Hale\u2019s\nterminology, the explanation of the justification of a proposition by\nappeal to another justified proposition is a non-transmissive one:\nwhile one must appeal in the explanation to a proposition that is in\nfact justified, the fact that it is justified plays no role in that\nexplanation. Thus there is, arguably, no reason to think that the\nregress of epistemic justification is vicious even if you\ndemand an explanation for why any of our beliefs are justified in the\nfirst place.\n\nIt\u2019s worth reflecting on the difference between the epistemic\nregress and the ontological regress of dependent entities that makes\nKlein\u2019s response here possible. Suppose that \\(A\\) is\nontologically dependent on \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) ontologically dependent on\n\\(C\\). It is very plausible that in this case, \\(C\\)\u2019s existence\nand/or nature is part of the explanation of \\(A\\)\u2019s existence\nand/or nature. In saying that \\(A\\) is ontologically dependent on\n\\(B\\) we are saying that \\(A\\) exists, or is the way it is, at least\npartly in virtue of \\(B\\)\u2019s existence and/or nature. So \\(B\\)\nhas to exist, or be the way it is, in order for \\(A\\) to exist, or be\nthe way it is. In explaining \\(A\\)\u2019s existence/nature, we are\nappealing to \\(B\\)\u2019s existence/nature, in which case it seems\nthat anything that we need to explain \\(B\\)\u2019s existence and/or\nnature\u2014in this case \\(C\\)\u2019s existence/nature\u2014must\nultimately be part of the explanation of \\(A\\)\u2019s existence\nand/or nature. That\u2019s why when we have a chain of ontological\ndependence, the existence and/or nature of the first entity seems to\nbe ultimately dependent on not just the existence/nature of the second\nentity in the chain, but on that of every subsequent entity in the\nchain: explanations of being appear to be transmissive. Which is why,\nif the chain is endless, we seem to lack an explanation as to why\nanything exists at all.\n\nBut while it is overwhelmingly plausible that \\(B\\) can only serve as\nthe ontological ground of \\(A\\) because \\(B\\) itself exists,\nor is the way it is, it is not forced on us to hold that\n\\(r_2\\) can only be a reason for \\(r_1\\) because \\(r_2\\) is itself\njustified, and this is why Klein\u2019s response to the epistemic\nregress is available. It need be no part of the explanation for why\n\\(r_2\\) is a reason for \\(r_1\\) that \\(r_2\\) itself be justified. As\nKlein says, the entirety of the explanation for why \\(r_2\\) is a\nreason for \\(r_1\\) might be simply that the objective probability of\n\\(r_1\\) given \\(r_2\\) is sufficiently high. That fact does not involve\n\\(r_2\\) being justified. Klein thinks that \\(r_2\\) must be\njustified if \\(r_1\\) is, but that need not be any part of why\n\\(r_2\\) is a reason for \\(r_1\\), and thus there is no pressure to hold\nthat the justification of \\(r_1\\) by \\(r_2\\) is dependent on, or\ninherited by, the justification of \\(r_2\\) by \\(r_3\\), and so on. So\nwhile there is indeed an infinite sequence of propositions, each of\nwhich is a reason for the previous one on the list, at no stage is the\nfact that one proposition is a reason for another hostage to the fact\nthat any other proposition is a reason for another. And so arguably,\nnothing remains unexplained: there can be a good explanation not only\nfor why each particular proposition is justified (\\(r_5\\) is justified\nby \\(r_6\\), etc.), but also for why there are any justified\npropositions in the first place (there are propositions that raise the\nobjective probability of others,\n e.g.).[13]\n",
