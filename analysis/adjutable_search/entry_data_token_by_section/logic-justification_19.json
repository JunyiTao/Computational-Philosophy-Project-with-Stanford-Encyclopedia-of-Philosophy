In Fagin and Halpern\n(1988) a simple mechanism for avoiding the problems was\nintroduced. One adds to the usual Kripke model structure an awareness\nfunction \\(\\cal A\\) indicating for each world which formulas the agent\nis aware of at this world. Then a formula is taken to be known at a\npossible world \\(\\Gamma\\) if 1) the formula is true at all worlds\naccessible from \\(\\Gamma\\) (the Kripkean condition for knowledge) and\n2) the agent is aware of the formula at \\(\\Gamma\\). Awareness\nfunctions can serve as a practical tool for blocking knowledge of an\narbitrary set of formulas. However as logical structures, awareness\nmodels can exhibit unusual behavior due to the lack of natural closure\nproperties. For example, the agent can know \\(A\\wedge B\\) but be aware\nof nether \\(A\\) nor \\(B\\) and hence not know either.\nPossible world justification logic models use a forcing definition\nreminiscent of the one from the awareness models: for any given\njustification \\(t\\) the justification assertion \\(t{:}F\\) holds at\nworld \\(\\Gamma\\) iff 1) \\(F\\) holds at all worlds \\(\\Delta\\)\naccessible from \\(\\Gamma\\) and 2) \\(t\\) is admissible evidence for\n\\(F\\) at \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\Gamma\\in{\\cal E}(t,F)\\). The principal\ndifference is in the operations on justifications and corresponding\nclosure conditions on admissible evidence function \\(\\cal E\\) in\nJustification Logic models, which may hence be regarded as a dynamic\nversion of awareness models which necessary closure properties\nspecified. This idea has been explored\nin Sedl\u00e1r (2013) which worked\nwith the language of \\(\\textsf{LP}\\), thinking of it as a multi-agent\nmodal logic, and taking justification terms as agents (more properly,\nactions of agents). This shows that Justification Logic models absorb\nthe usual epistemic themes of awareness, group agency and dynamics in\na natural way.\n",
