Life and Works\n\n\nMaimonides was born to a distinguished family in Cordova, Spain in\n 1138.[1]\n At that point, Cordova was under Muslim rule and stood as one of the\ngreat intellectual centers of the world. In addition to Maimonides, it\nwas the birthplace of Averroes. But events took a turn for the worse\nwhen the Almohads invaded in 1148 and offered all non-Muslims the\nchoice of conversion, exile, or death. Maimonides\u2019 family was forced to\nleave Cordova and travel through southern Spain and arrived in Fez,\nMorocco in 1160. His first philosophic work of note was the\nTreatise on the Art of Logic. Around this time, he began work\non his first religious masterpiece, the Commentary on the\nMishnah, which was finished in 1168. It is noteworthy for the\nemphasis Maimonides places on Oral Torah, by which he means the\ndetails, specifications, and interpretations derived from the Written\nTorah, which was revealed to Moses at Sinai.\n\n\nIt is also noteworthy for Maimonides\u2019 commentary on Chapter 10 of\nthe Mishnaic tractate Sanhedrin. While discussing the claim\nthat all Israel has a share in the world to come, Maimonides lists 13\nprinciples that he considers binding on every Jew: the existence of\nGod, the absolute unity of God, the incorporeality of God, the eternity\nof God, that God alone is to be worshipped, that God communicates to\nprophets, that Moses is the greatest prophet, that the Torah was given\nby God, that the Torah is immutable, that there is divine providence,\nthat there is divine punishment and reward, that there will be a\nMessiah, that the dead will be\n resurrected.[2]\n This was the first attempt to introduce articles of faith\nto Judaism and set off a controversy that persists to this day\n(Kellner 1986, 1999).\n\n\nMaimonides arrived in Egypt in 1166 and eventually settled in\nFustat, a section of Cairo. With the publication of the Mishneh\nTorah, he established himself as a thinker for the ages. Not only\ndoes this work systematize all the commandments of the Torah, it tries\nto show that every part of Jewish law serves a rational purpose and\nnothing is given for the sake of mere obedience.\n\n\nOf particular note are Book One (The Book of Knowledge),\nwhich sets forth the philosophic foundations of Jewish belief, a theory\nof moral traits or dispositions, the need to study the Torah, the laws\nconcerning idolatry, and the importance of repentance. Also of note is\nBook Fourteen (Judges), which ends by arguing that a Messiah\nwill come, restore sovereignty to Israel, establish peace with the\nother nations, and lead the world in the study of science and\nphilosophy. By contrast, the Messiah will not make people rich,\nintroduce changes in the Torah, or be required to perform miracles.\n\n\nThe Guide of the Perplexed was completed in 1190 and\ncontains Maimonides\u2019 most extensive philosophic discussions. Ostensibly\na letter written to an advanced student who cannot decide whether to\nfollow philosophy or the teachings of his religion, it is in reality\nmuch more: a commentary on biblical terms that appear to ascribe\ncorporeal qualities to God, an uncompromising defense of negative\ntheology, an extended critique of the kalam, a systematic treatment of\ncreation, prophecy, and providence, and a theory of jurisprudence.\n\n\nAccording to Maimonides, all of Jewish law aims at two things: the\nimprovement of the body and the improvement of the soul. The former is\nin every case a means to the latter. The soul is improved by acquiring\ncorrect opinions and eventually knowledge on everything humans are\ncapable of knowing. The more knowledge the soul acquires, the more it\nis able to fulfill the commandment (Deuteronomy 6:5) to love God. The\nbiggest stumbling block to love of God is the belief that the only way\nto remain true to the Bible is to interpret it literally. The result of\nliteral interpretation is a material conception of God, which, in\nMaimonides\u2019 opinion, amounts to idolatry.\n\n\nThe Guide has long been considered a controversial work and\nin some rabbinic circles was originally banned. By rejecting literal\ninterpretation, it raises the question of whether Maimonides\u2019 reading\nof the Torah corresponds to what the prophets understood or represents\na philosophic reconstruction that owes more to Aristotle and Alfarabi\nthan it does to Moses. It also raises the question of whether the real\nmeaning of the Torah is too controversial to be taught to the average\nworshipper and should be restricted to the educated few; in short the\nquestion of esotericism.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 last two works of note are the Treatise on\nResurrection, published in 1191, and the Letter on\nAstrology, published in\n 1195.[3]\n The former was written in answer to the charge that while\nhe may profess belief in bodily resurrection, Maimonides did not really\nhold it. The charge is not without merit given that Maimonides\u2019\nconception of the afterlife is purely intellectual and that his\nnaturalism makes him suspicious of miracles. He defends himself by\nsaying that the important issue is not whether and how resurrection\nwill occur but whether it is possible for it to occur. As for the\nlatter, once one accepts belief in creation, the possibility of bodily\nresurrection follows immediately. The Letter on Astrology was\nwritten at a time when many people believed that the heavenly bodies\nexert influence over human events. Nevertheless, he argues that there\nis no scientific basis for this belief and that it should be abandoned\neven if support for it can be found in the sacred literature.\n\n\nFacing ever-growing demands on his time, Maimonides worked himself\ninto a state of exhaustion and died in Fostat in 1204. An old saying\nhas it that from Moses to Moses, there was none like Moses.\n2. Fundamental Orientation\n\n\nMaimonides presents a challenge to the modern reader because his\nview of truth is totally unhistorical. We saw that he was guided by the\nneed to systematize. Given 613 original commandments, he argues that\nall are means to the fulfillment of the first two, which he interprets\nas belief in the existence of God and rejection of\n idolatry.[4]\n Together these commandments make up what we call\nmonotheism. From Maimonides\u2019 perspective, however, there is\nmore to monotheism than belief in a single deity. To satisfy the first\ntwo commandments, one must believe in a timeless, changeless,\nimmaterial deity who is one in every respect and unlike anything in the\ncreated order. A person who fails to recognize such a deity is accorded\nthe status of an idolater no matter how many other commandments she may\nfulfill or how fervently she may fulfill them. Simply put, to worship\nGod under a false description is not to worship God at all. Not only is\nthis true at present, as Maimonides sees it, it has been true since God\nfirst spoke to Adam.\n\n\nEarly in the Guide (1.2), Maimonides argues that Adam is\ndepicted as having the most perfect metaphysical knowledge a human\nbeing can achieve prior to his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. By\nnecessity this would have to include belief in a timeless, changeless,\nimmaterial deity. Even if the biblical text makes no mention of Adam\u2019s\ntheology, Maimonides thinks (MT 14 Kings and Wars, 9.1) it\nwould be impossible for someone to be this close to God and harbor a\nfundamental misunderstanding. Unfortunately Adam\u2019s knowledge was lost\nduring the time of Enosh and had to be rediscovered by Abraham\n(MT 1, Idolatry, 1.1\u20132; GP 3.29). Again Maimonides\nthinks he is justified in saying that Abraham discovered proofs for the\nexistence of a God who is neither a body nor a force in a body even\nthough the Bible is silent on such matters. These proofs were\nsupposedly passed down to Isaac and Jacob but lost during the Egyptian\ncaptivity when the Israelites adopted the pagan beliefs of their\ncaptors.\n\n\nWhen Moses arose to lead the people out of captivity, he faced a\nserious problem. If all he did were to offer philosophic proofs again, the\npeople would forget them just as they had forgotten before. So instead\nof offering proofs alone, he offered the blueprint for a social order\nthat would help the people remember their history and the principles on\nwhich it is founded. That is why in addition to the first two\ncommandments, there are 611 others designed to create an environment in\nwhich people will have the time, health, and mental facility needed to\ngrasp the truth of monotheism (GP 3.27\u201328).\n\n\nJudaism then is based on a particular philosophy. Maimonides\n(GP 1.71) takes this to mean that before Plato and Aristotle\nintroduced science and philosophy to the Greeks, the patriarchs\nintroduced it to Israel. To someone who asks why we have no explicit\nrecord of their philosophy, Maimonides answers that any record of such\nteaching was destroyed when Israel went into exile and suffered\npersecution. So despite the appearance of a split between Jerusalem and\nAthens, Maimonides thinks there is only one tradition worth preserving:\nthat which affirms the truth.\n\n\nHe makes this point in the Introduction to the Guide when\nhe says that what Jewish tradition taught under the guise of\nma\u2019aseh bereishit (the account of the beginning) is what\nGreeks thinkers taught as physics, while what Jewish tradition taught\nunder the guise of ma\u2019aseh merkavah (the account of\n[Ezekiel\u2019s] chariot) is what Greek thinkers taught under the guise of\nmetaphysics. In short, Jewish tradition has always been philosophical.\nThe problem is that these subjects are too difficult for the average\nworshipper to grasp and must be expressed as parables or metaphors that\nthe educated few will interpret at one level and the average worshipper\nat another (Stern 2013).\n\n\nLooking at his own situation, Maimonides concludes that the\ntradition of learning that began in Israel has been lost once again.\nPeople pray to a material God and justify their actions on the basis of\nliteral interpretation. Someone was needed to reverse this situation\nand reintroduce Jews to the teachings of their own tradition. Strictly\nspeaking, such truths are Jewish only in the sense that Jews were the\nfirst to discover them. From an ethnic standpoint, they are no more\nJewish than the Pythagorean theorem is Greek.\n\n\nAll this goes to show that Maimonides did not conceive of progress\nas we do. Although he regarded mastery of science and philosophy as\nessential parts of human perfection, he did not view them as\ncumulative. Rather than take us into new territory, his goal was to\nreacquaint us with the territory that Moses and the patriarchs had\nalready staked out. The important truths do not change. Human progress\nis measured by the degree to which they are identified and understood.\nThat is why the primary function of the Messiah will be to teach these\ntruths and help create conditions in which more people are able to\nreflect on them.\n3. Demythologized Religion\n\n\nIt is clear that the religion Maimonides envisions is not the normal\nkind. He recognizes that when one is first exposed to Bible stories and\nthe ritual of daily prayer, one may need anthropomorphic descriptions\nof God and promises of material reward. As he points out time and\nagain, the Torah speaks in the language of ordinary people. If it did\nnot, its appeal would be greatly reduced. But, Maimonides continues,\nthe purpose of the religion is to get one to the point where these\nthings cease to matter and are eventually overcome.\n\n\nTo take a few examples, the Bible often suggests that a prophet, or in\none case the elders of Israel, saw God (e.g., Exodus 24:10, Numbers\n12:8, Isaiah 6:1\u20133, Ezekiel 1:26\u201329). Maimonides counters\n(GP 1.4) by saying that the kind of seeing involved is\nintellectual rather than visual \u2014 as when one sees her way to\nthe solution of a geometry problem. By the same token, when God is\ndescribed as near or close, the Bible is not talking about physical\nlocation but intellectual apprehension \u2014 as when scientists say\nthey are close to finding a cure for a disease (GP 1.18). The\nmany places where the Bible says that God spoke to a prophet do not\nindicate that God has vocal cords that produce sound but that the\nprophet came to understand what God wants (GP 1.65). In a\nmore complicated way, Jacob\u2019s dream refers to the hierarchical\nstructure of the physical world and represents the path the\nphilosopher follows from knowledge of the sublunar realm to knowledge\nof the spheres and awareness of the existence of God (GP\n1.15).\n\n\nAgain one is inclined to ask: Is this the religion of the prophets\nor a philosophically sanitized religion concocted by a medieval thinker\nunder the sway of Aristotle? Maimonides would reply that there is no\ndifference. The highest human achievement is the perfection of the\nintellect (GP 3.27), which is impossible without the\npursuit of truth. As a sacred document, the Bible is a source of truth.\nWhile the truths contained in the Bible may not always be apparent, we\nknow in principle that they are there if one wishes to dig deeply\nenough. It follows that if one\u2019s interpretation ascribes to the Bible a\ndoctrine that is demonstrably false, such as the claim that God is\ncorporeal, the interpretation is incorrect no matter how simple or\nstraightforward it may seem. Should human knowledge advance and come up\nwith demonstrations it previously lacked, we would have no choice but\nto return to the Bible and alter our interpretation to take account of\nthem (GP 2.24). Anything else would be intellectually\ndishonest.\n\n\nWhere does this take us? In the Parable of the Palace (GP\n3.51), Maimonides describes the person who enters the inner habitation\nof the King as:\n He \u2026 who has achieved demonstration, to the\nextent that it is possible, of everything that may be demonstrated; and\nwho has ascertained in divine matters, to the extent that that is\npossible, everything that may be ascertained; and who has come close to\ncertainty in those matters in which one can only come close to it\n\u2026 \n\n\nThis is not just an intellectual achievement but a spiritual one as\nwell. In Maimonides\u2019 opinion, it is the goal to which all of the\ncommandments of the Torah point. There is an obvious sense of\nsatisfaction that goes with this, but it has nothing to do with\nsatisfaction material needs or \u201cecstasy\u201d as normally\nunderstood.\n4. God and the Via Negativa\n\n\nMaimonides offers several proofs for the existence of God, all of\nwhich are versions of the cosmological argument (GP 2.1).\nRather than begin with a definition of God and try to show that God\u2019s\nessence implies existence, he begins with a description of the world as\nwe know it and tries to show that it implies the existence of God.\nAccording to one such argument, we assume that the heavenly bodies are\nengaged in eternal motion. We then recognize that it is impossible for\nthere to be an infinite body or an infinite number of finite bodies. So\nevery corporeal thing is finite. If it is finite, it can only contain a\nfinite amount of power. If it can only contain a finite amount of\npower, it can only explain motion over a finite period of time. Because\nthe heavenly bodies are always moving, the only thing that can explain\nthat motion is an infinite power. Because an infinite power cannot be\ncontained in a finite thing, it cannot be corporeal. If it is not\ncorporeal, it is not subject to division or change. Seeing that its\npower is infinite, it cannot derive that power from something else.\nThus the only way to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies is to\nposit the existence of a being that is neither a body nor a force in a\nbody.\n\n\nAlthough Maimonides thinks this argument gives us sufficient grounds\nfor saying that God is, he does not think it provides any\ngrounds for saying what God is. To see why not, we have to\nrecognize that God is not one in a way comparable to anything else: one\nperson, one number, one idea. According to Guide 1.51:\n There is no oneness at all except in believing that\nthere is one simple essence in which there is no complexity or\nmultiplicity of notions, but one notion only; so that from whatever\nangle you regard it and from whatever point of view you consider it,\nyou will find that it is one, not divided in any way and by any cause\ninto two notions \u2026 \n\n\nIf Maimonides is right, there can be no plurality of faculties,\nmoral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that\nGod is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce\nplurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate\nattributes. The same is true if we say that God is a composite of\nmatter and form, genus and specific difference, or essence and\naccident. All introduce plurality where none can be tolerated.\n\n\nAside from religious considerations, plurality is objectionable\nbecause it compromises logical priority. If God were a composite of\nF and G, some reason would have to be found for what\nbrought them together and keeps them together. In short, if God were a\ncomposite, there would have to be a cause prior to God, which is absurd\n(GP 2. Intro., premise 21). For the same reason, God cannot be\nsubsumed under a wider concept as man is subsumed under\nanimal (GP 1.52). Once God fell under a genus, there\nwould be something prior to or more inclusive than God, either of which\nis absurd. Without a genus or a minimal form of composition, there is\nno possibility of defining God and thus no possibility of saying what\nGod is. Even superlatives are of no help. To say that God is the wisest\nor most powerful thing in the universe is still to subsume God under a\nwider description.\n\n\nWorse, to say that God is the wisest or most powerful thing is to\nimply that God\u2019s wisdom or power bears some likeness to ours. This\nMaimonides firmly denies (GP 1.56\u201357). The power manifested by\na body is finite and can be measured in foot/pounds. No matter how\npowerful it is, we can easily imagine something whose power is greater.\nWhat is more, if we are talking about the power of a body, it always\nmakes sense to ask from what it derives its power or how its power is\nrelated to something else, e.g. its goodness. None of this is true of\nGod. Maimonides therefore concludes (GP 1.56) that it is\nnot true to say that God\u2019s power is greater than ours, that\nGod\u2019s life is more permanent than ours, than God\u2019s knowledge is broader\nthan ours, or that God\u2019s will is more universal than ours, if that\nmeans that God can be put on the same scale as something else, that God\nis a bigger, stronger, better version of something in the created\norder.\n\n\nDoes that mean that statements like \u201cGod lives\u201d or\n\u201cGod is powerful\u201d are nonsense? The answer is yes if one\ninsists on interpreting them as normal subject/predicate propositions.\nBut they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations.\nThus \u201cGod is powerful\u201d should be taken as \u201cGod is not\nlacking in power.\u201d Maimonides\u2019 appeal to negation (GP\n1.58) is often misunderstood because in normal speech a double negative\nusually indicates a positive. If I say that this dog is not lacking in\nthe power of sight, you would be justified in concluding that it can\nsee for the simple reason that sight is a power normally associated\nwith dogs. What Maimonides has in mind is a more extreme form of\nnegation. Thus \u201cGod is powerful\u201d means \u201cGod does not\nlack power or possess it in a way that makes it comparable to\nother things.\u201d Can God do something like move a book off a shelf?\nYes, to the extent that God does not lack power but no to the extent\nthat God does not have to move muscles, summon energy, or receive a\nsupply of food or fuel. The power to create the whole universe is so\nfar beyond that needed to move a book that any comparison cannot help\nbut mislead.\n\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, a statement like \u201cGod is\npowerful\u201d is objectionable in so far as it implies that we have\ninsight into the essence of God. The advantage of the negative\nformulation is that it implies nothing of the sort. To say that God\ndoes not lack power or possess it in a way comparable to other things\nis to say that God\u2019s power is beyond our comprehension. And similarly\nfor God\u2019s life, wisdom, unity, or will. Thus most of the terms we use\nto describe God are completely equivocal as between God and us. There\nis then no reason to think that every time we praise God, we are\nidentifying a separate part of the divine persona and comparing it to\nsomething else.\n\n\nAs severe as Maimonides\u2019 position is, even this is not enough.\nAlthough negation is preferable to affirmation, even negation is\nobjectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity: God is\nneither this nor that. What then? Maimonides\u2019 reply (GP 1.58)\nis that ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us. Rather than\nprovide a precise metaphysical account of the nature of God, the\npurpose of theological discourse is heuristic: to \u201cconduct the\nmind toward the utmost reach that man may attain in the apprehension of\nHim.\u201d Theological language is important to the degree that it\neliminates error and sets us along the path of recognizing God\u2019s\ntranscendence. Unless one could speak about God, she could easily fall\ninto the trap of thinking that God is corporeal. But in the end, the\nonly thing it reveals is that God is beyond the reach of any\nsubject/predicate proposition. Thus GP 1.59:\n Know that when you make an affirmation ascribing\nanother thing to Him, you become more remote from Him in two respects:\none of them is that everything You affirm is a perfection only with\nreference to us, And the other is that He does not possess a thing\nother than His essence \u2026 \n\n\nCiting Psalm 65, Maimonides concludes that the highest form of\npraise we can give God is silence.\n\n\nMaimonides knows (GP 3.32) that a religion based entirely\non silent reflection would never succeed, and insists that daily prayer\nis mandatory (MT 2, Prayer, 1.1). His point is that the\nqualities mentioned in prayer are either negations or descriptions of\nthe effects of divine activity; in no case do they provide knowledge of\nGod\u2019s essence. To illustrate this point, he asks us to consider\nthe effect of fire on various things that could be put before it. It\nwould soften wax, harden clay, blacken sugar, and whiten other things.\nThis does not mean that fire is soft, hard, black, and white\nsimultaneously but that it has these effects on various things.\n\n\nApplying this analogy to God, we can say that God is merciful to the\nextent that the order of nature (what God created) exhibits merciful\ncharacteristics and angry to the extent that it is harsh toward things\nthat do not take proper care of themselves. The point is not that God\npossesses emotions similar to ours but that the effects of God\u2019s\nactions resemble the effects of ours. Maimonides refers to these\nqualities as attributes of action and identifies them with the\ngoodness God revealed to Moses at Exodus 33. In that passage, God\nrefuses to let Moses see the divine face (which Maimonides identifies\nwith essence) but allows him to see God\u2019s backside (which Maimonides\nidentifies with the consequences or effects that flow from God). We can\ntherefore praise God as long as we realize that all such praise is\nindirect and leaves God\u2019s essence undescribed and unknowable.\n5. Creation\n\n\nThroughout the Guide, Maimonides considers four accounts of\ncreation: that of the kalam, Moses, Plato, and Aristotle. He rejects\nthe kalam account (GP 1.71\u201373) according which one\ndemonstrates that the universe must have been created and then reasons\nthat if it was created, it must have a creator. Like Thomas Aquinas,\nMaimonides believes it is impossible to show by logical considerations\nalone either that the universe was created or that it is eternal.\nThough Maimonides says he believes in creation, he admits one can do no\nmore than tip the scales in this direction. As of Guide 2.13,\nhe limits his discussion to the theories of Moses, Plato, and\nAristotle.\n\n\nUnfortunately Maimonides\u2019 characterizations of these alternatives\nare neither precise nor historically accurate (Seeskin 2005). Suffice\nit to say that his treatment of them is mainly thematic. Briefly\nstated, they are:\n\n\nMoses:\nthe world was created de novo and entirely ex\nnihilo.\n\n\nPlato:\nthe world was created de novo from a preexisting material\nsubstrate.\n\n\nAristotle:\nthe world is eternal and its existence is best understood as eternal\ninformation of matter.\n\n\n\n\nBased on his explicit remarks, Maimonides prefers the theory of\nMoses but allows one to hold that of Plato as a reasonable alternative.\nBut there has always been a school of thought that maintains that he is\nsecretly committed to the view of Aristotle (Harvey 1981). My own\nposition is with those who argue that Maimonides\u2019 explicit remarks are\nan accurate account of his view and that all the arguments he offers\npoint in that direction (Davidson 1979, Feldman 1990, Hyman 1988,\nWolfson 1973).\n\n\nThe historical Aristotle did argue that the world is eternal and\nthat whatever is eternal is necessary [On Generation and\nCorruption 338a1\u20134, Physics 203b 29, Metaphysics\n1050b8\u201315]. His medieval followers took this to mean that while the\nworld is ontologically dependent on God, there is no moment when it\nfirst comes to be and therefore does not owe its existence to a\ndecision to create. As we might say, it exists not because of anything\nGod does but simply because of what God is. Because God\u2019s nature does\nnot change, according to this position, neither does the existence or\nfundamental structure of the world. The most important consequence of\nthis view is that God does not exercise free choice, which is to say\nthat according to the Aristotelian alternative, the world is governed\nby necessity.\n\n\nThe standard arguments in favor of this position take one of two\napproaches: either they show that there is something inherent in the\nnature of the world that makes creation impossible or that there is\nsomething inherent in the nature of God that does. An example of the\nformer is that change always proceeds from something to something else,\nas when a chicken springs from an egg or an acorn develops into a full\ngrown oak tree. If this is true, it is impossible for something to come\nto be from nothing (ex nihilo). An example of the latter is\nthat if God is perfect, it makes no sense to suppose that God could\never do anything new such as bring the world into being.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 answer to the first argument (GP 2.17) is that\ngiven the world as we know it, change does proceed from one thing to\nsomething else. But why should we assume the creation of the world has\nto follow the same pattern? An account of creation is a theory of\norigin, how a thing comes to be initially. By contrast, an account of\nchange is a theory of development or alteration, how one existing thing\nemerges into another. For all we know, the origin of a thing may be\ncompletely different from its development later on. Thus it is\npresumptuous to suppose that we can extrapolate from our experience of\nthe world as it is at present to the moment of its creation. It follows\nthat the first argument against creation is not decisive, which means\nthat creation remains a possibility.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 answer to the second argument (GP 2.18) is that\nin a perfect being, willing something new need not imply change. If I\nwill today to take a trip tomorrow and events intercede to spoil my\nplans, I may have to change my mind, but to suppose that something\nanalogous happens to God is absurd. Assume I will today to do something\ntomorrow independent of external circumstances \u2014 to think about the\nnumerical characteristics of pi. And assume that when tomorrow comes, I\ndo exactly as planned. While I would be undertaking something new, to\nthe degree that I had intended to do it all along, it would be\nmisleading to say that I underwent a change. Certainly I did not\nundergo a change of mind.\n\n\nMaimonides takes this to mean that it is possible for a being not\naffected by external circumstances to will something new as long as it\nis part of his original intention. This is sometimes expressed by\nsaying that changing one\u2019s will is not the same as willing change. So\nonce again, the argument against creation is not decisive.\n\n\nMaimonides is aware that all his arguments establish is the\npossibility of creation, not its actuality. To go further, and argue\nfor the actuality of creation, he returns to the claim that everything\nthat is eternal is necessary. If it could be shown that there are\nfeatures of the world that are not necessary, it would follow that the\nworld must have been created. Here Maimonides challenges Aristotle and\nhis followers on the issue of astronomy.\n\n\nMedieval Aristotelians believed as follows. God thinks and manifests\nself-awareness. Because God is one and simple, what emerges from God\nmust be one and simple as well. In this way, God generates the first\nheavenly intelligence. According to Alfarabi, because the first\nintelligence is aware of two things \u2014 itself and God \u2014 it\nis capable of generating two things: the second heavenly intelligence\nand the outermost sphere of the universe. By contrast, Avicenna held\nthat because the first intelligence is aware of God and duality in\nitself, it generates three things. The difference need not concern us\nhere. The important point is that God\u2019s production of the outermost\nsphere is indirect; the immediate cause is the activity of the first\nintelligence. The process continues until we get the ten intelligences\nand nine primary spheres that make up the standard picture of medieval\ncosmology.\n\n\nMaimonides criticizes this account in two ways. First if the\noriginator of a causal sequence is one and simple, there is no way for\ncomplexity to arise, and everything else in the sequence should be one\nand simple as well (GP 2.22). Even if the sequence contains\nthousands of members, there is no way to account for the complexity of\na celestial sphere, which is a composite of matter and form. When we\nget to the inner spheres, we have to account for even more because not\nonly is there the sphere itself but the stars or planets attached to\nit. They too are composites of matter and form. How can we have such\ncomplexity if we start with something that is radically one?\n\n\nSecond, there are features of the heavenly bodies that defy\nscientific explanation and thus appear to be contingent in the sense\nthat they were chosen rather than necessitated (GP 2.19\u201324).\nIf the outer spheres impart motion to the inner ones, we would expect\nspherical motion to slow as we move closer to the earth. But this is\nhardly the case. As Maimonides points out (GP 2.19):\n\n\nWe see that in case of some spheres, the swifter of motion is above\nthe slower; that in the case of others, the slower of motion is above\nthe swifter; and that, again in another case, the motions of the\nspheres are of equal velocity though one be above the other. There are\nalso other very grave matters if regarded from the point of view these\nthings are as they are in virtue of necessity.\n\n\nIf there is no explanation for why the spheres behave in this\nfashion, or why some stars and planets emit more light than others, or\nwhy some regions of the heavens are relatively crowded while others are\nempty, there is no reason to think the phenomena in question are what\nthey are by virtue of necessity. If there is no necessity, there are no\ngrounds for eternity. The alternative is to say that God created the\nworld as a result of a free choice and fashioned it in a particular\nway.\n\n\nMaimonides recognizes (GP 2.24) that his argument does not\nconstitute a demonstration. Just because science cannot explain\nsomething now, it does not follow that it will never be able to explain\nit. As he himself admits, science can and does make progress. But in\nthe case of the heavenly bodies, he thought progress very unlikely.\nBecause they too far away to make close observations, and too high in\nrank, we can only rely on inferences based on accidental qualities\nsize, speed, and direction. As long as this is true, we will never know\ntheir essential natures and will never be able to support claims of\nnecessity. As long as this is true, creation, though not demonstrated,\nwill always be preferable to eternity.\n\n\nMaimonides (GP 2.25) also offers a practical reason for\nbelieving in creation: How can a God without free will issue\ncommandments? Beyond this there is a textual reason: belief in creation\ndoes less violence to scripture than belief in eternity. He concludes\nthat the theory of Moses offers the best alternative, while that of\nPlato, which retains the idea of creation de novo, is\nacceptable. Though some people fault Maimonides for not coming up with\na stronger argument on behalf of Moses, he would reply by saying that\ngiven the limits of our knowledge, this is the strongest argument we\ncan expect. Although Maimonides is often seen as part of the\nAristotelian tradition, and often expresses praise for Aristotle, his\naccount of creation indicate that he is willing to depart from\nAristotle when he thinks the arguments lead in that direction.\n6. Practical Philosophy\n\n\nWe have already seen that for Maimonides the highest perfection is\nintellectual and consists in ascertaining in divine matters everything\nthat can be ascertained. Proper behavior, whether for the individual or\nthe community, is a means to this end (GP 3.27). On a\npolitical level, this means that the state must do more than protect\nlife and property; it must see to it that all its citizens are educated\nin religious matters and that a small number achieve mastery\n(GP 2.40). On a personal level, it means that morality is not\nan end in itself but a way of controlling the passions and creating an\natmosphere in which science and philosophy can flourish (GP\n3.8). While intellectual perfection is oriented to truth and falsity\nand aims at demonstration, moral perfection is oriented to good and bad\nand rests on commonly accepted opinions.\n\n\nAccordingly Adam was blessed with perfect metaphysical knowledge in\nthe Garden of Eden but still did not know that it is wrong not to cover\none\u2019s genitals. Although this knowledge cannot be known with scientific\nprecision, it does not follow that it is arbitrary. On the contrary, it\nis among the most basic customs one can imagine. Maimonides expresses\nthis point (GP 2.40) by saying that revealed law\n\u201calthough it is not natural, enters into what is natural.\u201d\nI take this to mean that unlike scientific truth, law presupposes a\nsocial context and a sense of shame. In Maimonides\u2019 opinion, it still\nneeds to be studied in detail. Thus the quote continues: \u201cIt is a\npart of the wisdom of the deity with regard to the permanence of this\nspecies.\u201d\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 practical philosophy begins with Eight\nChapters, an introduction to his commentary on the tractate\nPirkei Avot and part of his Commentary on the\n Mishnah.[5]\n In concert with Plato and Aristotle, he holds that like the body, the\nsoul can be diseased or healthy. Just as those with sick bodies seek a\nphysician, those with sick souls need to seek the wise rulers, who are\nphysicians of the soul. Not surprisingly major portions of his work\nattempt to show that Jewish law is based on a thorough understanding\nof the soul and the conditions needed for its perfection.  Chief among\nthem is the attainment of a mean between extremes. In Eight\nChapters 3, he writes: \u201cThe virtues are states of the soul\nand settled dispositions in the mean between two bad states, one of\nwhich is excessive, the other deficient.\u201d Later, in the first\nbook of the Mishneh Torah (1, Character Traits, 1.4), he\nfollows up by saying: \u201cThe right way is the mean in every one of\na person\u2019s character traits.\u201d\n\n\nLike Aristotle, Maimonides recognizes there will be variations from\none person to another and that sometimes a person may have to overshoot\nthe mean for therapeutic reasons (Eight Chapters 4 and\nMT 1, Character Traits, 2.2). Also like Aristotle, he stresses\nthat virtue is a habit that can only be developed by practice. A wise\nruler will therefore prescribe actions and moral habits that must be\nrepeated until they are no longer burdensome and become part of a\nperson\u2019s character. If a person develops the wrong habits and goes to\nexcess, the ruler \u201cmust follow the same course in treating it as\nin the medical treatment of bodies,\u201d which is to reestablish\nequilibrium (\u201cEight Chapters\u201d 4).\n\n\nMaimonides claims his theory is sound in its own right and can be\ndistilled from the sayings of the prophets and sages. He offers Psalm\n19:8 (\u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul; the\ntestimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple\u201d) as\nevidence that the Bible recognizes the idea of psychic health and\ndisease. He also connects adherence to the mean with the doctrine of\nimitatio Dei (imitation of God), by arguing that (GP\n2.28): \u201cThe works of the deity are most perfect, and with regard\nto them there is no possibility of an excess or a deficiency.\u201d As\nGod governs nature, so Maimonides thinks, the wise ruler will attempt\nto govern society.\n\n\nIt is true, as Maimonides says many times, that Jewish law does not\nask people to live as hermits, starve themselves, beat themselves, or\njeopardize their health. Though it allows for a category of extremists\nin the laws dealing with the Nazirite, Maimonides is right to say that\nit treats the Nazirite with suspicion (\u201cEight Chapters\u201d 4).\nThe qualities that really matter are good judgment, kindness, and\ncompassion \u2014 all things Maimonides explains by going back to the\ndoctrine of the mean. People are asked to give to charity, honor their\nparents, refrain from certain sexual relations, not hate or take\nvengeance, and not eat certain foods in order establish a moderate\ndisposition. By the same token, the holidays are arranged so that some\ninvolve rejoicing while others involve moderate forms of self-denial.\nIn no case does the law require anything for the sake of obedience\nalone.\n\n\nMaimonides points out there are cases where the analogy between body\nand soul breaks down, in particular the fact that legal reasoning is\ndifferent from medical reasoning. The physician does not treat the\nconcept humanity but the particular person who comes to her. But this\nis not true of the law, which, in Maimonides\u2019 opinion (GP\n3.34), treats the general case and pays no attention to rarities. That\nis why the law is not dependent on time and place but tries to\nestablish a standard that is absolute and universal. To take a modern\nexample, the law prescribes a limit to the amount of alcohol a person\ncan have in his blood and still be able to drive. Undoubtedly there are\nvariations among individuals that allow one person with a certain\namount of alcohol to be much more alert than another. But it is not the\npurpose of the law to take these differences into account. All it can\ndo is set a norm and enforce it equally.\n\n\nStill anyone familiar with Maimonides will see that acceptance of\nthe mean is hard to reconcile with other aspects of his thought. When\nhe describes God as governor of the universe balancing justice with\nmercy, the doctrine of the mean makes good sense; when he describes God\nas lacking emotion and incomparable to anything in the created order,\nit does not. Similarly, when he describes prophets as law-givers, the\nmean is an appropriate standard; when he describes them as people who\nbegrudge the time they spend with others and prefer to contemplate God\nalone in silent meditation (GP 3.51), it fails.\n\n\nMuch has been written on which of these approaches represents\nMaimonides\u2019 real view (Fox 1990, Davidson 1987, Schwarzschild 1990).\nFortunately we do not have to survey all of this literature because the\nproblem arises in the space of a few paragraphs in MT 1,\nCharacter Traits, 1.4\u20136. Unlike \u201cEight Chapters,\u201d where the\nonly justification for overshooting the mean is therapeutic, this\npassage recognizes that there are times when deviation from the mean\nrepresents a higher standard. As Maimonides puts it, a person whose\ncharacter traits are balanced can be called wise (hakham),\nwhile a person who goes beyond the mean when circumstances warrant is\nknown as pious (hasid):\n Whoever moves away from a haughty heart to the opposite\nextreme so that he is exceedingly lowly in spirit is called pious; this\nis the measure of piety. If someone moves only to the mean and is\nhumble, he is called wise; this is the measure of wisdom. The same\napplies to all the rest of the character traits. The pious of old used\nto direct their character traits from the middle way toward one of the\ntwo extremes; some character traits toward the last extreme, and some\ntoward the first extreme. This is the meaning of \u201cinside the line\nof the law\u201d [i.e. going beyond the letter of the law].\n\n\n\nPiety then involves going beyond the mean to a higher standard. In\nthis connection Maimonides cites Numbers 12:3, which does not say that\nMoses was meek but that he was very meek.\n\n\nSimilar remarks apply to Maimonides\u2019 analysis of anger. For\nAristotle [Nicomachean Ethics 1125b31\u20131126a8] a person should\nbe praised for being angry with the right people in the right way and\nat the right time. A person who allows himself to be abused by insults\nwithout getting angry lacks feeling and behaves in a manner that is\nslavish. Virtue is worthy of honor. Just as it is wrong to ask for too\nmuch, it is equally wrong to ask for too little.\n\n\nWith respect to anger, Maimonides disagrees, claiming (MT\n1, Character Traits, 2.3) it is \u201can extremely bad character\ntrait\u201d and that \u201cit is proper for someone to move away from\nit to the other extreme and to teach himself not to be angry, even over\nsomething it is proper to be angry about\u201d (Frank 1990). For\nAristotle meekness indicates a loss of self-esteem; for Maimonides it\nis not a virtue but virtue par excellence. By ascribing it to\nMoses, he implies that it represents the highest level a person can\nachieve.\n\n\nA similar sentiment is expressed earlier in the Mishneh\nTorah (1, Basic Principles, 4. 12), when Maimonides discusses the\nneed to study physics and metaphysics. He concludes with praise for\nthose who are lowly of spirit:\nWhen a man reflects on these things, studies all these\ncreated beings, from the angels and spheres down to human beings and so\non, and realizes the divine wisdom manifested in them all, his love for\nGod will increase, his soul will thirst, his very flesh will yearn to\nlove God. He will be filled with fear and trembling, as he becomes\nconscious of his lowly condition, poverty, and insignificance, and\ncompares himself with any of the great and holy bodies; still more when\nhe compares himself with any one of the pure forms that are incorporeal\nand have never had association with any corporeal substance. He will\nthen realize that he is a vessel full of shame, dishonor, and reproach,\nempty and deficient. \n\n\nIt is not that Maimonides has abandoned the idea that nature avoids\nexcess or deficiency but that he seems to be saying the highest level\nof human excellence sometimes requires an extreme. Thus Moses went\nwithout water for forty days and nights when he was alone on the\nmountain and attained such a high level of concentration that in\nMaimonides opinion \u201call the gross faculties in the body ceased to\nfunction.\u201d Seen in this light, the highest goal is not practical\nwisdom in the Aristotelian sense but humility, awe, and shame in the\npresence of God.\n\n\nIn other places, Maimonides argues that our goal should not be to\nmoderate emotion but to rise above it. We saw that God is not subject\nto emotion. Maimonides takes this to mean that the ideal state is one\nin which a person acts in a completely dispassionate way deciding cases\non their merit without recourse to feeling. While such a person must\nstill make the appropriate judgment, there will be no character trait\nor disposition from which it springs. According to Guide\n1.54:\nIt behooves the governor of a city, if he is a prophet,\nto acquire similarity to these attributes [jealousy, hatred, or anger],\nso that these actions may proceed from him according to a determined\nmeasure and according to the deserts of the people who are affected by\nthem and not merely because of his following a passion. He should not\nlet loose the reins of anger nor let passion gain mastery over him, for\nall passions are evil; but, on the contrary, he should guard against\nthem as far as this lies within the capacity of man. Sometimes, with\nregard to some people, he should be merciful and gracious, not out of\nmere compassion and pity, but in accordance with what is fitting.\n\n\n\nIn the treatise on Character Traits, he admits that there may be\ntimes when it is necessary for a person to show anger, but insists that\ninwardly she should remain completely tranquil.\n\n\nWhat happened to balance and the idea of mental health? The answer\nis that while they are still valuable, they are not ends in themselves.\nThroughout his rabbinic and philosophic works, Maimonides insists\n(MT 1, Character Traits, 3.1) that it is impossible to love\nGod and achieve the highest levels of concentration if one is sick,\nundisciplined, or living in fear of bodily harm. But in the end, moral\nperfection is only a necessary condition for intellectual\nperfection.\n\n\nLike Plato, Maimonides believes in the therapeutic effects of\nphilosophy. In the last chapter of the Guide (3.54), he claims\nthat philosophy teaches that most of the things to which people direct\ntheir lives are \u201cnothing but an effort with a view to something\npurely imaginary, to a thing that has no permanence.\u201d Just as Job\ncame to see that the things he once valued are unimportant, philosophy\nteaches us to give up our obsession with money, garments, and land and\nfocus attention on the eternal.\n\n\nIn the end, the relation between moral and intellectual virtue is\nmore complicated than Maimonides first presents. It is not just that\nthe former is a means to the latter but that after the latter is\nachieved, after one comes to see that earthly goods are fleeting and\nultimately unsatisfying, his behavior will undergo a transformation:\nrather than aim for a moderate amount of earthly goods, he will forgo\nthem and spend as much time as possible in a state of awe and\nreverence, where the distinction between moral and intellectual\nperfection may even break down.\n7. Esotericism\n\n\nSince the publication of the Guide, scholars have struggled\nwith a thorny issue: whether to take Maimonides\u2019 words at face value or\nwhether to take them as hints or clues pointing to a hidden or deeper\nmeaning (Ravitzky 1981, 1990, 2005; Strauss 1952). By rejecting\nliteral interpretation and playing down the importance of miracles, he\nknew he was taking a controversial stand. As he notes in the\nIntroduction to the Guide, Jewish law prohibits one from\ndiscussing esoteric matters like the Account of the Beginning or the\nAccount of the Chariot in public. The idea is that these matters should\nonly be discussed with an advanced student capable of finding the truth\non her own. In Maimonides\u2019 view, both the Bible and the rabbinic\ncommentaries that grew up around it are esoteric in the sense that the\nreal meaning is often different from the surface or apparent meaning.\nThe reason for this is that the people who read them have different\nlevels of comprehension. But Maimonides goes further, saying that in\nsome cases it is necessary for an author to contradict himself.\n\n\nOf the seven reasons for using contradictions, Maimonides says he\nwill avail himself of two. The first is relatively unproblematic:\nsometimes it is necessary for a teacher to say one thing to reach a\nstudent\u2019s level of understanding and say something else when the\nstudent becomes more advanced. The second is more troublesome: on very\nobscure matters, it is necessary to launch a discussion that proceeds\naccording to one assumption and later launch one that proceeds\naccording to another. He then adds: \u201cIn such cases the vulgar\nmust in no way be aware of the contradiction; the author accordingly\nuses some device to conceal it by all means.\u201d\n\n\nThis raises several questions. (1) Does Maimonides employ\ncontradictions of the troublesome variety? (2) If so, where? (3) Of two\ncontradictory discussions, which represents his view? In the\ntwentieth century, Leo Strauss argued that contradictions are central\nto understanding the Guide and that the more evidence\nMaimonides presents for a particular view, the less likely it is that\nhe held it (Strauss 1952). There is general agreement that\nMaimonides\u2019 writing is esoteric to the degree that he addresses\ndifficult topics and does not put everything he has to say on a\nparticular topic in any one place. The question is whether his\nesotericism goes deeper than this. We saw for example that he\ncriticizes Aristotle\u2019s on the eternity of the world. Does this mean\nthat he believed in creation or that if you strip away the surface\nmeaning, he is really committed to eternity? As often happens, one\nquestion leads to another: Do we settle the matter by examining the\nstrength of his arguments or by looking for hidden clues? Of late the\nesotericist reading appears to be losing favor (Davidson 2005, Ivry\n1991, Manekin 2005, Ravitzky 2005, Seeskin 2000).\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nHow one assesses Maimonides\u2019 philosophy depends on one\u2019s own\nphilosophic view. For a traditional theist like Aquinas, he is right to\nsay that there are issues, e.g. creation, that cannot be resolved by\ndemonstration and to insist that all attempts to anthropomorphize God\nare misguided. The problem is that in rejecting anthropomorphism, he\nmay have gone too far. If God bears no likeness to the created order,\nand if terms like wise, powerful, or lives\nare completely ambiguous when applied to God and us, the conception of\ndivinity we are left with is too thin for the average worshipper to\nappreciate.\n\n\nFor a naturalist like Spinoza, Maimonides is too willing to dismiss\nscience and take refuge in traditional concepts like creation and\ndivine volition. Granted that medieval astronomy did not have a good\nexplanation of planetary motion; with the advent of the scientific\nrevolution, it found one \u2013 at least in Spinoza\u2019s opinion.\nIf Maimonides were to remain true to his word and accept the strongest\nargument wherever it leads, as far as Spinoza\u2019s is concerned, he\nwould have to embrace the new science, the eternity of the world, and\nthe necessity of every event that takes place in it. In order to do\nthis, he would have to abandon the idea that the Bible is a source of\nphilosophic and scientific truth and look to it only for the light it\nsheds on how to live. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for\nMaimonides.\n\n\nEven if Maimonides were to make this move and read the Bible for its\nethical content, problems would remain. Maimonides is an elitist.\nCloseness to God is measured by how much knowledge one acquires. The\nresult is that people whose situations prevent them from pursuing\nadvanced studies cannot be close to God or love God. Whether it is\nright or wrong, this view offends modern sensibilities, which are much\nmore democratic.\n\n\nFinally for an atheist, Maimonides\u2019 philosophy shows us what happens\nif you remove all anthropomorphic content from your conception of God:\nyou remove all content of any kind. In the end, you are left with a God\nwhose essence is unknowable and indescribable.  Of what possible value is\nsuch a conception either to philosophy or religion?\n\n\nAt his trial for impiety in 399 B.C., Socrates was asked how it is\nthat the wisest person in Athens claims to be ignorant of the\nknowledge he seeks. His answer (Apology 23a-b) is that he is\nwise because unlike others, he recognizes that when measured against\ndivine wisdom, human wisdom is of little or no value. Although it is\ndoubtful that he read Socrates\u2019 words, there is little question that\nthis is the insight Maimonides is trying to preserve. That person is\nwisest who recoils in awe and humility in the face of something\ninfinitely greater than he or she can fathom. This insight explains\nwhy, despite his best efforts, Maimonides was unable to find airtight\ndemonstrations for many of his insights about God, creation, and\nrevelation and is often content just to tip the scales in one\ndirection or present an honest assessment of the problem.  In a recent\nwork, Alfred Ivry (2016, 4) contends that Maimonides himself is\none of the perplexed for whom the Guide was written.\n\nViewed in a sympathetic light, Maimonides\u2019 elitism stems\nfrom the recognition that few people will be satisfied with this.\nAlthough not everyone in the history of philosophy would agree, there\nis no question that Maimonides\u2019 view has a long history and remains a\npowerful alternative.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"Ant\">Anthologies</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Munk, S. and I.
