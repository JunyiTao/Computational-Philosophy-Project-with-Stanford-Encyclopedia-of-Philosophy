    "main_text": "\n\nPlato discusses love (er\u00f4s) and friendship\n(philia) primarily in two dialogues, the Lysis and\nthe Symposium, though the Phaedrus also adds\nsignificantly to his views. In each work, Socrates as the\nquintessential philosopher is in two ways center stage, first, as a\nlover of wisdom (sophia) and discussion (logos),\nand, second, as himself an inverter or disturber of erotic norms.\nPlato\u2019s views on love are a meditation on Socrates and the power\nhis philosophical conversations have to mesmerize, obsess, and\neducate.\n\nIn what follows, section 1 deals with the Lysis and\nSymposium. Sections 2\u20134 primarily with the\nSymposium alone. Section 5 deals with the Phaedrus.\nSection 6 with the closing section of the Symposium and with\nparts of the Ion, Protagoras, and Laws.\nSections are not self-contained, however, and are intended to be read\nsequentially. Most scholars agree that the order of composition of the\n\u201cerotic\u201d dialogues is Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus,\nthough some put the Phaedrus earlier than the\nSymposium.\n",
