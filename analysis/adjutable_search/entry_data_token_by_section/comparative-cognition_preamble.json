    "main_text": "\n\nComparative cognition is the study of cognition across the tree of\nlife. Nonhuman animals (hereafter animals) display a broad and often\nsurprising range of cognitive abilities. Kea (a species of large\nparrot endemic to New Zealand) solve problems using domain-general\nstatistical inference (Bastos & Taylor 2020), Eurasian jays are\ndeceived by magic tricks (Garcia-Pelegrin et al. 2021), and bumblebees\nmay be conscious (Gibbons et al. 2022). Researchers in the field of\ncomparative cognition seek to understand the cognitive mechanisms\ngiving rise to animal behavior, including their evolutionary,\ndevelopmental, and socioecological history. Comparative cognition is\nan interdisciplinary field bringing together tools from ecology,\nethology, cognitive science, developmental psychology, evolutionary\nbiology, and neuroscience, among others (Shettleworth 2009). There is\nalso a robust philosophical literature on the methods of comparative\ncognition. Philosophers aim to address questions such as, \u201cwhat\nis evidentially required to show that animals have causal\nreasoning?\u201d and \u201chow can we avoid anthropocentricism in\nthe study of nonhuman minds?\u201d How best to define\n\u201ccognition\u201d is an area of debate (Allen 2017). For our\npurposes, we can follow Sara Shettleworth\u2019s broad\ncharacterization of cognition as \u201cthe mechanisms by which\nanimals acquire, process, store and act upon information from the\nenvironment\u201d (2010a: 4; see also entry on\n animal cognition).\n",
