    "main_text": "Fancies\n9. Fancies\n\nCavendish holds that what it is for a being to be free is for it to\nhave the wherewithal to do as it pleases without obstacle or\ninterference. She holds that many beings are in fact unfree, because\nthey have goals and aims that the surrounding world of objects works\nto thwart and prohibit. Cavendish\u2019s own goals of being a philosopher\nand scientist and political leader are a case in point. In many of her\ntexts she proposes that an appropriate response to the obstacles and\nconstraints of the real-world plenum is to develop and employ our\nfaculty of imagination to model alternative worlds that are more\namenable to our values, interests, and needs. She suggests a number of\nreasons why the construction of imaginary worlds might be of benefit:\n(1) they allow us to experience a version of the life that we are\nblocked from pursuing in the actual world; (2) they are enjoyable to\ninhabit; (3) they allow us to hold onto the self with which we\nidentify when the actual world does not leave room for us to\nexpress it; (4) they allow us to register for the record and for\nposterity why that self was not a viable option.\n\nCavendish writes in \u201cTo all Noble and Worthy Ladies,\u201d a\npreface to Blazing World, that if the real life blocks her\nfrom embodying a life with which she identifies, she will construct an\nanalogue of that life in her imagination. She writes,\n\nI am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or\ncan be; which is the cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth,\nor Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the\nFirst: and, though I have neither Power, Time, nor Occasion, to be a\ngreat Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be\nMistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I\nhave made One of my own. (Cavendish 1666, 6)\n\n\nCavendish supposes that imaginary worlds are enjoyable to inhabit.\nHere she is reflecting a view that is uncontroversial, at least if we\ntake seriously the level of pleasure that individuals seem to secure\nfrom getting lost in a book or play or other fictional realm. A person\nwill sometimes encounter a significant amount of frustration in their\nday-to-day life, for example in their job or their personal\nrelationships, and that person might be quite impatient to return to a\nstory in which they have been immersed. Cavendish herself suggests\nthat a vividly imagined world can be a source of greater\nsatisfaction than the world that is in front of us:\n\nFancy is the Ground whereon the Poetical aery Castles are built. There\nis no such sweet and pleasing Compagnion as Fancy, in a Poetical Head.\n(Cavendish 1655, 100\u2013101)\n\n\nCavendish also has some of the characters in her fiction express a\nsimilar view. In The Lady Contemplation, the main character\nproposes that\n\nthe greatest pleasures that can be in Fruition, I take in Imagination:\nfor whatsoever the sence enjoys from outward objects, they may enjoy\nin inward thoughts. For the mind takes as much pleasure in creating of\nFancies, as Nature to create and dissolve, and create Creatures anew:\nFor Fancy is the Minds creature, & imaginations are as\nseveral worlds, wherein those Creatures are bred and born, live and\ndye; thus the mind is like infinite Nature. (Playes, 184)\n\n\nWe might concede that Cavendish is right that a fictional world can\noften be a welcome alternative to our actual everyday affairs (also\nWalters 2014, 167\u2013168), but we might worry that she is\noverstating the case if she supposes that we can be just as fulfilled\nimagining a life with which we identify as we can by living it in\nfact. There is a difference between inhabiting a world of fictional\ncharacters \u2013 for example in an engrossing book or play \u2013\nand inhabiting a world that represents our own longing for a life that\nhas been denied to us. To inhabit the latter sort of world might just\nbring despair. Cavendish does not appear to think so, however, but she\nmight also be supposing that there is pleasure in capturing for the\nrecord why a particular world has been cut off from us, rather than\njust allowing ourselves to dissolve into one of the lives that has\nbeen made available. She might also be supposing that we can achieve\nan afterlife of fame if we write about alternative worlds and what\nthey have going for them, in a way that helps them to come to be. If\nthere is an alternative world that is much more desirable than the one\nin which we find ourselves, a written record of it might have both a\npersonal and a social impact.\n\nCavendish indeed speaks in a wide spectrum of texts of the ways in\nwhich the seventeenth-century world that surrounds her is not as\naccommodating to the pursuits and goals of women as it is to the\npursuits and goals of men. In some of these texts she says that the\nclimate for women has been so hostile that it is in fact true that\nwomen do not have the same capacities as men: women are either denied\nthe relevant training and expertise, or they are not taken seriously\nand their capacities are not allowed a platform. She writes,\n\nI here present the sum of my works, not that I think wise School-men,\nand industrious, laborious students should value my book for any\nworth, but to receive it without a scorn, for the good incouragement\nof our sex, lest in time we should grow irrational as idiots, \u2026\nthrough the carelesse neglects, and despisements of the masculine sex\nto the effeminate, thinking it impossible we should have either\nlearning or understanding, wit or judgement, as if we had not rational\nsouls as well as men, and we out of a custom of dejectednesse think so\ntoo, which makes us quit all industry towards profitable knowledge\nbeing imployed onely in loose, and pettie imployments, which takes\naway not onely our abilities towards arts, but higher capacities in\nspeculations, so as we are become like worms that onely live in the\ndull earth of ignorance, winding our selves sometimes out, by the help\nof some refreshing rain of good educations which seldom is given us;\nfor we are kept like birds in cages to hop up and down in our houses,\nnot sufferd to fly abroad to see the several changes of fortune, and\nthe various humors, ordained and created by nature; thus wanting the\nexperiences of nature, we must needs want the understanding and\nknowledge and so consequently prudence, and invention of men: thus by\nan opinion, which I hope is but an erronious one in men, we are shut\nout of all power, and Authority by reason we are never imployed either\nin civil nor marshall affaires, our counsels are despised, and laught\nat, the best of our actions are troden down with scorn, by the\nover-weaning conceit men have of themselves and through a dispisement\nof us. (Cavendish 1663, \u201cTwo the Two Universities,\u201d\nunnumbered)\n\n\nThere will be many Heroick Women in some Ages, in others very\nPropheticall; in some Ages very pious, and devout: For our Sex is\nwonderfully addicted to the spirits. But this Age hath produced many\neffeminate Writers, as well as Preachers, and many effeminate Rulers,\nas well as Actors. And if it be an Age when the effeminate spirits\nrule, as most visible they doe in every Kingdome, let us take the\nadvantage, and make the best of our time, for feare their reigne\nshould not last long ; whether it be in the Amazonian Government, or\nin the Politick Common-wealth, or in flourishing Monarchy, or in\nSchooles of Divinity, or in Lectures of Philosophy, or in witty\nPoetry, or any thing that may bring honour to our Sex. (Cavendish\n1653, \u201cTo all Writing Ladies,\u201d unnumbered)\n\n\nsince all Heroick Actions, Publick Employments, as well Civil as\nMilitary, and Eloquent Pleadings, are deni\u2019d my Sex in this Age, I may\nbe excused for writing so much. (Cavendish 1671, C4)\n\n\nIn this last passage Cavendish is suggesting that one outlet for the\nenergies of an individual who is blocked from pursuing their more\noutwardly directed aspirations is to write. In Blazing World,\nBell in Campo, and other texts, Cavendish indeed utilizes\nthat outlet to enact roles that are regularly denied to women in the\nplenum of seventeenth-century England. The plenum does not allow women\nto take on any number of roles, and it does not advance them the\nopportunity to acquire the requisite skill and training and know-how.\nBut even if women did acquire that training, there is an\nimportant sense in which they would still lack the capacities for the\nroles in question. Consider the following scene that Cavendish\nconstructs in the Introduction to her Playes:\n\n1. Gentleman. This Play that I would have you go to, is a new Play.\n\n\n2. Gentleman. But is there newes in the Play, that is (is there new\nwit, fancyes, or new Scenes) and not taken out of old storyes, or old\nPlayes newly translated?\n\n\n1. Gentleman. I know not that, but this Play was writ by a Lady, who\non my Conscience hath neither Language, nor Learning, but what is\nnative and naturall.\n\n\n2. Gentleman. A woman write a Play! Out upon it; out upon it, for it\ncannot be good, besides you say she is a Lady, which is the likelyer\nto make the Play worse, a woman and a Lady to write a Play; sigh,\nsigh.\n\n\n3. Gentleman. Why may not a Lady write a good Play?\n\n\n2. Gentleman. No, for a womans wit is too weak and too conceived to\nwrite a Play.\n\n\n1. Gentleman. But if a woman hath wit, or can write a good Play, what\nwill you say then?\n\n\n2. Gentleman. Why, I will say no body will believe it, for if it be\ngood, they will think she did not write it, or at least say she did\nnot, besides the very being a woman condemnes it, were it never so\nexcellent and care, for men will not allow women to have wit, or we\nmen to have reason, for if we allow them wit, we shall lose our\nprehemency \u2026 .\n\n\nWe might consider alternative cases that are just as easy to envision\n\u2013 a woman who is highly trained as doctor or attorney, but who\ndoes not come across as sufficiently authoritative to a patient or\njury; an Asian-American who is a seriously talented actor but who\ncannot get a role in a movie except as a caricature, if that is all\nthat audiences are willing to see; a highly-trained African\nAmerican carpenter who has trouble getting hired to build a backyard\nfence or deck if that means leaving him with a key to enter the house\nduring the day; a figure like Mersault in Camus\u2019s The\nStranger, who would have easily merited acquittal by self-defense\nif he had not come across as such an outsider. In all of these cases,\nthere are the motions that take place on the side of the agent, and\nthere are the motions that occur in the outside environment. Cavendish\nis pointing out that our ability to live a life with which we identify\nis a function of both kinds of motion and that the second kind of\nmotion is much more amenable to some than to others. The judge and\njury in all such cases do not necessarily run through a conscious\npattern of exclusionary reasoning to single out the agent in question;\nthere might just be a feeling of discomfort, and often it is easiest\nto take the path of least resistance.\n\nThere are number of explicit reasons that Cavendish suggests as to why\nthe construction of imaginary worlds would be of benefit. There are\nadditional reasons that she might have as well, but to posit these on\nher behalf is a bit more speculative and requires further research.\nThe reasons include: (5) they allow us to model a picture of a world\nthat might come to be \u2013 that is, to model a route by which we\nmight get there, and to shine a light on otherwise invisible obstacles\nthat might be in our way; (6) they habituate other minds and ready\nthem for change that would otherwise feel sudden and abrupt; and (7)\nwritten records of the most successful of our imaginings might survive\nand secure us an afterlife of fame. Cavendish was fairly conservative\nin her politics, but that does not mean that the she did not single\nout particular phenomena for criticism, and it does not mean that she\nhad an in-principle aversion to social\n change.[42]\n In passages that we have considered, she certainly takes issue with\npractices that perpetuate gender inequality, and she models\nscience-fictional worlds that expose how that inequality would be\ndramatically reduced if our own world were very different. She also\nindicates in some passages that an advantage of modeling alternative\nscenarios in imagination, as opposed to straightforwardly imposing\nthem on the world, is that certain kinds of violence and unrest can be\navoided. In the Epilogue to Blazing World, she writes,\n\nBy this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition is\nnot onely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and that the\nWorlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other Philosophical\nWorld, mentioned in the first Part of this Description, are framed and\ncomposed of the most pure, that is, the Rational parts of Matter,\nwhich are the parts of my Mind; which Creation was more easily and\nsuddenly effected, than the Conquests of the two famous Monarchs of\nthe World, Alexander and Cesar. Neither have I made such disturbances,\nand caused so many dissolutions of particulars, otherwise named\ndeaths, as they did; for I have destroyed but some few men in a little\nBoat, which dyed through the extremity of cold, and that by the hand\nof Justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing\naway a young and beauteous Lady. And in the formation of those Worlds,\nI take more delight and glory, than ever Alexander or Cesar did in\nconquering this terrestrial world; and though I have made my\nBlazing-world a Peaceable World, allowing it but one Religion, one\nLanguage, and one Government; yet could I make another World, as full\nof Factions, Divisions and Warrs, as this is of Peace and Tranquility;\nand the Rational figures of my Mind might express as much courage to\nfight, as Hector and Achilles had; and be as wise as Nestor, as\nEloquent as Ulysses, and as beautiful as Hellen. But I esteeming Peace\nbefore Warr, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the\nfigures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses,\nHellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle,\nwhich now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if\nany should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my\nSubjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean\nin their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to\nbe Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern\nthemselves as they please. (Cavendish 1666, 109)\n\n\nIn this passage, Cavendish speaks to the way in which participation in\nfictional stories does not lead to some of the difficult and\nproblematic consequences that would occur if those stories unfolded in\nreal life. We know that Cavendish witnessed the horrors of civil war\nin her own time, and she might subscribe to the view that social\nchange needs to be gradual if it is to occur at all and not lead to\nsuch consequences \u2013 in particular, to the kind of backlash that\nsets progress back further still. Writing is no doubt a platform that\ncan make more malleable some of the resistance to social change. If a\ntradition is predominant and entrenched, and a critical mass of\nindividuals benefit from its continued existence, the attempt to\noverturn it in real life will be countered with at least as much\nforce. Imagination would appear to be more fluid, and over the long\nhaul a vividly entertained scenario might become so familiar as to be\ninnocuous. If we are the author of that scenario, we might even become\nfamous for playing a part in changing the world.\n",
