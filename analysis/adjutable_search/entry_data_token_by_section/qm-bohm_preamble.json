    "main_text": "\n\nBohmian mechanics, which is also called the de Broglie-Bohm theory,\nthe pilot-wave model, and the causal interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, is a version of quantum theory discovered by Louis de\nBroglie in 1927 and rediscovered by David Bohm in 1952. It is the\nsimplest example of what is often called a hidden variables\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics a system of\nparticles is described in part by its wave function, evolving, as\nusual, according to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation. However, the\nwave function provides only a partial description of the system. This\ndescription is completed by the specification of the actual positions\nof the particles. The latter evolve according to the\n \u201cguiding equation\u201d,\n which expresses the velocities of the particles in terms of the wave\nfunction. Thus, in Bohmian mechanics the configuration of a system of\nparticles evolves via a deterministic motion choreographed by the wave\nfunction. In particular, when a particle is sent into a two-slit\napparatus, the slit through which it passes and its location upon\narrival on the photographic plate are completely determined by its\ninitial position and wave function.\n\nBohmian mechanics inherits and makes explicit the nonlocality implicit\nin the notion, common to just about all formulations and\ninterpretations of quantum theory, of a wave function on the\nconfiguration space of a many-particle system. It accounts for all of\nthe phenomena governed by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, from\nspectral lines and scattering theory to superconductivity, the quantum\nHall effect and quantum computing. In particular, the usual\nmeasurement postulates of quantum theory, including collapse of the\nwave function and probabilities given by the absolute square of\nprobability amplitudes, emerge from an analysis of the two equations\nof motion: Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation and the guiding equation.\nNo invocation of a special, and somewhat obscure, status for\nobservation is required.\n",
