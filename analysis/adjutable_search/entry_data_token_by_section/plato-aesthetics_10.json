    "main_text": "Divine Inspiration\n3. Divine Inspiration\n\nIn simplest form \u201cinspiration\u201d names the claim that poets\nare aided in producing their own poetry. At lucky moments a god takes\nthem over and brings value to the poem that it could not have had\notherwise.\n\nInspiration of that kind is a common idea. Either a divine source\nprovides the poet with information needed for writing the poem\n(information about past events or the gods\u2019 lives, for example); or\nmore generally the source gives the poet the talent needed for writing\nanything. The idea is far from original with Plato. Within Greek\nculture alone there are Homer and Hesiod, who begin their great works\nasking a Muse to \u201cspeak into\u201d them. In this case, by\ncontrast with that of imitation, Plato finds a new use for an idea\nthat has a cultural and religious meaning before him (Ledbetter 2003,\nMurray 1981, Tigerstedt 1970).\n\nPlato\u2019s version of the idea has proved to be durable and influential.\nThe old chestnut about a fine line between genius and insanity is only\nthe best-known legacy of Platonic inspiration, as popularized in one\nway by Cesare Lombroso\u2019s work on \u201cpsychiatric art\u201d\n(Lombroso 1891, 2); in another way by Shelley, who translated the\nIon in 1821 believing its account of poetic madness supported\nhis own defense of poetry (Shelley 1840).\n\nThe topic occurs throughout Plato\u2019s corpus. Platonic characters\nmention inspiration in dialogues as far apart\u2014in date of\ncomposition; in style, length, content\u2014as the Apology\nand the Laws, though for different purposes. Socrates on\ntrial tells of his frustrated effort to learn from poets. Their verses\nseemed excellent but the authors themselves had nothing to say about\nthem (Apology 22b). Socrates concludes that poets work\ninstinctively and while inspired, enthousiazontes, as\nprophets and soothsayers also do (theomanteis,\nchr\u00easm\u00f4idoi), as opposed to writing on the basis\nof sophia (22c). The opposition between wisdom and\ninspiration does not condemn poets. They write by some nature\n(phusei tini), as if inspiration were a normally occurring\nhuman instinct.\n\nFor its part Laws 719c links the effects of inspiration to\nthe nature of drama and its multiple perspectives: \n\nWhen the poet sits on the Muse\u2019s tripod [en t\u00f4i tripodi\nt\u00eas Mous\u00eas] he is not in his right mind\n[emphr\u00f4n] but ready to flow like a fountain; and\nbecause his profession [techn\u00ea] is that of imitation\n[mim\u00ease\u00f4s], then in creating people\n[anthr\u00f4pous] who are set against one another he is\ncompelled to contradict himself frequently, and he does not know\n[oiden] whether these or the other thing of what he says are\ntrue [al\u00eath\u00ea]. But it is not for a lawmaker to\nmake two statements about a single topic in a law. (719c\u2013d)\n\n\nAs in the Republic, mim\u00easis leaves the\nspectator with no truths to evaluate or wish to assess them. And, as\nin the Apology, inspiration means the poet has no truths to\ntransmit. When the god\u2019s power comes the poet\u2019s\ngoes. Lawmakers work differently from that. And this contrast between\ninspiration and the origin of laws\u2014occurring in a dialogue\ndevoted to discovering the best laws for cities\u2014hardly suggests\nan endorsement for inspiration.\n\nBut it is also true that the passage puts the poet on a tripod, symbol\nof Apollo\u2019s priestesses. Whatever brings a poet to write verse brings\ndivine wisdom out of priestesses; and Plato regularly defers to the\nauthority of oracles. Even supposing that talk of inspiration denies\nindividual control and credit to the poet, the priestess shows that\ncredit and control are not all that matters. She is at her best when\nher mind intrudes least on what she is saying. Her pronouncements have\nthe prestige they do, not despite her loss of control, but because of\nit (Pappas 2012a).\n\nAnother passage in the Laws says as much when it attributes\neven reliable historical information to poets writing under\nthe influence of the Muses and Graces (682a). The Meno makes\ninspiration its defining example of ignorant truth-speaking.\nPoliticians are just like \u201cprophets and soothsayers\n[chr\u00easm\u00f4idoi, theomanteis].\u201d All three,\n\u201cwhen inspired [enthousi\u00f4ntes], speak truly\n[al\u00eath\u00ea] about many things, but do not know what\nthey are talking about\u201d (99c). Removing all doubt about the\norigin of that truth, Socrates calls prophets, soothsayers, and all\npoets theioi \u201cdivine\u201d because of how well they\nspeak without possessing knowledge (99c\u2013d).\n\nIn these more tangential remarks in the Apology,\nLaws, and Meno, Plato seems to be affirming 1) that\ninspiration is really divine in origin, and 2) that this divine action\nthat gives rise to poetry guarantees value in the result. It may\nremain the case that the poet knows nothing. But something good must\ncome of an inspiration shared by poets and priestesses, and often\nenough that good is truth.\n",
