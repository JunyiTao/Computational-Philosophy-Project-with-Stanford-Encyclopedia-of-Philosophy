    "main_text": "The semantics of elementary questions || Questions in dynamic semantics\n2.2 Questions in dynamic semantics\n2.2.1 Updating equivalence relations\n\nWe now turn our attention to a line of work that aims to capture the\nsemantics of questions in a dynamic framework. The first\ntheories in this line of work were developed by J\u00e4ger (1996),\nHulstijn (1997), and Groenendijk (1999). Aloni et al. (2007b)\ncontains a collection of papers elaborating on these early proposals.\nAll these theories essentially reformulate the partition theory of\nquestions in the format of an update semantics (Veltman 1996). This\nmeans that they explicitly identify meanings with context change\npotentials, i.e., functions over discourse contexts. However,\nunlike a simple update semantics where discourse contexts are modeled\nas sets of worlds\u2014embodying the information established in the\ndiscourse so far\u2014these theories provide a more refined model of\ndiscourse contexts, one that also embodies the issues that have been\nraised so far. More specifically, a discourse context is modeled as an\nequivalence relation \\(R\\) over a set of worlds \\(C\\). The\nset of worlds \\(C\\), i.e., the domain of \\(R\\), can be thought of as\nthe context set, i.e., the set of all worlds that are\ncompatible with the information established in the discourse so far.\n\\(R\\) itself induces a partition on \\(C\\), and can thus be taken to\nencode the issues that have been raised so far. More specifically, we\ncan think of \\(R\\) as relating two worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) just in case\nthe difference between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) is not (yet) at issue, i.e.,\nthe discourse participants have not yet expressed an interest in\ninformation that would distinguish between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\). In other\nwords, \\(R\\) can be conceived of as a relation encoding\nindifference (Hulstijn 1997).\n\nBoth assertions and questions can then be taken to have the potential\nto change the context in which they are uttered. Assertions restrict\nthe context set \\(C\\) to those worlds in which the asserted sentence\nis true (strictly speaking, they remove all pairs of worlds \\(\\langle\nw,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) such that the asserted sentence is false in at\nleast one of the two worlds). Questions disconnect worlds,\ni.e., they remove a pair \\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) just in\ncase the true exhaustive answer to the question in \\(w\\) differs from\nthe true exhaustive answer to the question in \\(v\\).\n\nThus, the dynamic framework of J\u00e4ger (1996), Hulstijn (1997), and\nGroenendijk (1999) provides a notion of context and meaning that\nembodies both informative and inquisitive content in a uniform way.\nHowever, the framework inherits several issues from the classical\npartition theory of questions, in particular those discussed above\nconcerning conditional and alternative questions.\n\nMoreover, there is a conceptual issue concerning the equivalence\nrelation \\(R\\). Namely, if \\(R\\) is primarily thought of as a relation\nencoding indifference, then it is not clear why it should\nalways be an equivalence relation. In particular, it is not\nclear why \\(R\\) should always be transitive. The discourse\nparticipants could very well be interested in information that\ndistinguishes \\(w\\) from \\(v\\), while they are not interested in\ninformation that distinguishes either \\(w\\) or \\(v\\) from a third\nworld \\(u\\). To model such a situation, we would need an indifference\nrelation \\(R\\) such that \\(\\langle w,u\\rangle \\in R\\) and \\(\\langle\nu,v\\rangle \\in R\\) but \\(\\langle w,v\\rangle \\not\\in R\\). This is\nimpossible if we require \\(R\\) to be transitive.\n2.2.2 Giving up transitivity\n\nThese concerns have been addressed by Groenendijk (2009) and\nMascarenhas (2009). The overall architecture of their system is very\nmuch like that of the early dynamic systems discussed above, only\nindifference relations are no longer defined as equivalence relations,\nbut rather as reflexive and symmetric (not necessarily transitive)\nrelations.\n\nGroenendijk and Mascarenhas argued that this adjustment, besides\naddressing the conceptual issue concerning indifference relations\ndiscussed above, also allows for a better analysis of conditional\nquestions and alternative questions. However, Ciardelli (2009) and\nCiardelli and Roelofsen (2011) show that, although the proposed system\nindeed behaves better for simple cases, it does not scale up to more\ncomplex cases in a suitable way. In particular, whereas alternative\nquestions with two disjuncts, like (10) above, are dealt with\nsatisfactorily, or at least more satisfactorily than in a partition\nsemantics, alternative questions with three or more disjuncts are\nstill problematic.\n\nThe gist of the problem can be illustrated with a simple example.\nConsider a language with three atomic sentences, \\(p, q\\), and \\(r\\),\nand an information state consisting of three worlds, \\(w_{pq},\nw_{qr}\\), and \\(w_{pr}\\), where the subscripts of each world indicate\nwhich atomic sentences are true at that world. Note that in this\ninformation state none of the atomic sentences is known to hold. Now\nconsider an issue which is resolved just in case at least one of the\natomic sentences is established, i.e., just in case we know that the\nactual world is located within one of the ovals depicted in figure\n1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An issue that cannot be\nrepresented in the pair-semantics.\n\n\nThe problem with the system of Groenendijk (2009) and Mascarenhas\n(2009) is manifested by the fact that this issue cannot be represented\nby means of an indifference relation. An indifference relation over\nthe information state \\(\\{w_{pq},w_{qr},w_{pr}\\}\\) necessarily\ncontains all reflexive world-pairs, and possibly one, two, or three\nnon-reflexive pairs. In either case, however, the resulting issue does\nnot correspond to the one depicted in Figure 1.\n\nThe general conclusion that has been drawn from this problem, as\ndiscussed in detail by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011), is that\nquestion meanings cannot be suitably modeled in terms of indifference\nrelations, even if these indifference relations are allowed to be\nnon-transitive. This insight has led to the development of an\nalternative logical notion of question meanings, which forms the\ncornerstone of the framework of inquisitive semantics, to be\ndiscussed below.\n",
