    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Published Works\n3. Hegel\u2019s Published Works\nWe may think of there being five different types of work that make\nup Hegel\u2019s published corpus. First, there are Hegel\u2019s two\nmajor stand-alone books written for publication already\nmentioned\u2014Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\nand Science of Logic (1812\u201318). In the next category\nare works that were published at the time as handbooks for\nuse in student teaching such as the Encyclopaedia of Philosophical\nSciences first published in 1817 while he was teaching at\nHeidelberg and subsequently revised and republished in 1827 and again\nin 1830, and Elements of the Philosophy of Right, effectively\nan expansion of a section of the Encyclopaedia and published\nin 1820 after his move to Berlin. (Transcripts of his earlier lectures\non this topic delivered in Heidelberg have also since been published.)\nAlong with the Encyclopaedia and the Philosophy of\nRight might be added similar teaching-related writings from the\nJena period, prepared as lectures but only published as such much\nlater. The third major category is formed by posthumously published\nlecture courses from his time at the University of Berlin, which,\nafter Hegel\u2019s death, were assembled by editors from his lecture\nnotes and from student transcripts of the lectures as\ndelivered\u2014these include his lectures on the Philosophy\nof Nature, Philosophy of Spirit, Philosophy of\nHistory, Aesthetics, Philosophy of Religion,\nand History of Philosophy.  Next might be considered various\nmiscellaneous essays and short works published during his career, and\nfinally we can count Hegel\u2019s early works, written in the period\nbetween his student years at T\u00fcbingen and his move to Jena, and\npredominantly on religious and political themes\n(ETW). Here we will restrict the discussion to the first three\ncategories.\n",
