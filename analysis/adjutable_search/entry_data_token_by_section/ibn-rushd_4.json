    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n4. Natural Philosophy\n\nThe previous section followed the order of discovery, beginning with\nwhat is better known to us. Here we start with what is causally prior,\nand so begin with the First Cause. (On Ibn Rushd\u2019s method of\ninquiry see Cerami 2015 ch. 7.) Although the existence of some kind of\nFirst Cause was undisputed, religious and philosophical authorities\ndisagreed about the nature of creation. The most common view was that\nthe world came into existence, from God, after having not existed, but\nIbn Rushd follows Aristotle in supposing that the world has always\nexisted, eternally. His strategy for explaining how an eternal world\ncan have a First Cause turns on distinguishing between two kinds of\ncausal orderings, essential and accidental.\n\nCauses that are essentially ordered are simultaneous, such that the\nprior stages are a condition for the effect\u2019s ongoing existence,\nas when waves move a ship, the wind moves the waves, and the wind is\nmoved by elemental forces (QPhys 7.25 {235};\nIncoherence I.1 {59}). In such a series there must be a first\ncause, because an endless such series would be actually infinite all\nat once, which Ibn Rushd regards as impossible (Incoherence\nI.4 {275}). The series could, moreover, never reach its end, since\ncausal agency cannot pass through an infinitely long series in a\nfinite time (LongPhys VII.6; QPhys 7.25 {235}). This\nFirst Cause cannot itself be something in motion, given the\nAristotelian dictum that everything that is in motion must be moved by\nanother (LongPhys VII.1; QPhys 7.30 {236}). In\nprinciple, Ibn Rushd allows that there could be many unmoved movers\n(QPhys 7.35 {238}), but at a minimum there must be one such\nthing that is immovable, and eternally so, because otherwise some\nstill prior mover would be required to move the supposedly first\nmover, and this would lead again to an essentially ordered infinity of\nmovers (EpiMeta 4.139 {126}). (For the intricate details see\nTwetten 2007.)\n\nAn accidental ordering takes place over time, as when rain comes from\na cloud, the cloud comes from vapor, and vapor comes from a prior rain\n(Incoherence I.4 {268}). Such an ordering is circular,\ninasmuch as the materials from one stage are corrupted and reused in a\nlater stage, and so there is no threat of an actual infinity. There is\nthus nothing incoherent about such a series extending infinitely far\ninto the past and infinitely far into the future, and indeed Ibn Rushd\nargues that such an infinity can be proved in various ways (Davidson\n1987). One fundamental proof arises from the nature of the First\nCause. Since it is itself unmoved\u2014that is, wholly\nchangeless\u2014its causal agency must likewise be eternal. \u201cA\nthing lacking the potential for change and alteration cannot be\nchanged at any time, since if it were then its alteration would be by\ncause of itself, and so there would be alteration without the\npossibility for it\u201d (LongCaelo I.103). It is, for Ibn\nRushd, incoherent to posit an eternally existing, changeless\nactuality, which suddenly springs into agency after having not acted\nfor an eternity. In general, \u201cthe effect of a cause cannot be\ndelayed after the causation\u201d (Incoherence I.1 {15}).\nSimilar considerations show that the world\u2019s future existence\nmust likewise be eternal (Incoherence 1.1 {22}).\n\nFor the reasons just rehearsed, an eternal and unchanging First Mover\nentails an eternal and unchanging first thing moved, and observation\nsuggests that this must be the outermost sphere of the stars, whose\ndiurnal rotation in turn moves everything within its ambit:\n\u201cthere is a moved thing that is first by nature, which moves the\nwhole, and which terminates every movement whose mover is\nexternal\u2026. The mover of this [first] moved thing is, of itself,\nnot a body and is absolutely and essentially unmoved\u201d\n(EpiPhys 8.242 {141}). Past this first ceaseless motion, the\ncausal story becomes increasingly complex, under the influence of the\ncelestial intelligences. Ibn Rushd is suspicious of the unrealistic\nconvolutions of Ptolemaic cosmology, preferring to honor the\nprinciples of Aristotelian physics even where that leaves a gap\nbetween theory and observation (Sabra 1984; Endress 1995). A\nstrikingly personal remark describes how he had once aspired to close\nthat gap, but has now, in his old age, abandoned the project\n(LongMeta XII.45 {1664}). Anticipating the modern rise of\nscientific specialization, he yields the field to those who devote\nthemselves solely to this one science (LongMeta XII.48\n{1679}).\n\nThe spheres move eternally in majestic circles simply because it\nbefits their lofty existence to do so (EpiMeta 4.152 {140},\nLongMeta XII.36 {1595}, Incoherence I.15 {484}), but\nthese motions have a subordinate effect of signal importance to us:\nthey sustain the very existence of our sublunary world. Most\nbasically, the motion of the celestial spheres\u2014although they are\nnot themselves hot (SubstOrb 2.95)\u2014gives rise to heat\nin the fiery region immediately beneath the lunar sphere, and from\nheat and its contrary, cold, arise the four elements: earth, air,\nfire, water. \u201cThe existence of the celestial body entails\nnecessarily the existence of the elements \u2026 as preserving,\nefficient, formal, and final cause\u201d (EpiMeta 4.171\n{161}; Incoherence I.3 {261}). The bodies that furnish our\nsublunary realm are various elemental mixtures, in which the elements\nthemselves endure in an attenuated state, as the material strata above\nprime matter (EpiMeta 1.48 {32}; LongCaelo III.67;\nEpiGC I.121 {22\u20133}; see Maier 1982 ch. 6). The\nqualities of these elements\u2014hot, cold, wet, dry\u2014\u201care\nthe causes of all natural things that come into being and pass\naway\u201d (Incoherence II.1 {525}). The entire system so\ndepends on the celestial spheres that \u201cif the motion of the\nheavens were destroyed, \u2026 the world in its totality would be\ndestroyed\u201d (SubstOrb 4.117; Kashf 5.112\n{191}).\n\nMatter is, at least potentially, infinitely divisible, but at the\nlevel of elements and mixed bodies we can refer to the smallest body\ncapable of still being a body of that kind\u2014the minimum\nnaturale\u2014e.g., \u201cthe minimal possible magnitude of\nfire\u201d (EpiPhys 7.212 {114}, Glasner 2009 ch. 8; Cerami\n2015, 429\u201336). Any sort of mixed body requires a substantial\nform to actualize it, but Ibn Rushd\u2019s view of how such forms\nemerge evolves. His early works hold that, at least at the level of\nliving things, substantial forms cannot be generated by wholly natural\nprocesses, but require a celestial \u201cgiver of forms,\u201d the\nAgent Intellect (EpiMeta 4.171 {162}). His later view is more\nthoroughly naturalistic, and argues that prime matter contains the\npotentiality for all substantial forms, which need only be actualized\nby a natural agent, along with the usual cooperation of the celestial\nbodies (LongMeta VII.31 {883}, XII.18.109 {1499}; see\nDavidson 1992 ch. 6; Freudenthal 2002; Cerami 2015 chs.\n8\u20139).\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s naturalistic conception of generation and corruption\nis of a piece with one of his most famous philosophical stances, his\nrejection of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s occasionalism. On this\ntheological tradition, \u201cwhen a man moves a stone by leaning\nagainst it and pushing it, he does not push it, but it is the Agent\nwho creates the motion\u201d (LongMeta XII.18.112 {1504}).\nIbn Rushd heaps scorn on this view in the Incoherence,\nresting his case most fundamentally on the link between a\nthing\u2019s causal role and its defining nature: \u201cit is\nself-evident that things have essences and attributes that determine\nthe special functions of each thing and through which the essences and\nnames of things are differentiated. If a thing did not have its\nspecific nature, it would not have a special name nor a definition,\nand all things would be one\u201d (II.1 {520}). (For discussion of\nthis argument see Kogan 1985 ch. 3.)\n\nFor further details see the entry on\n Ibn Rushd\u2019s natural philosophy\n and the entry on\n causation in Arabic and Islamic thought.\n",
