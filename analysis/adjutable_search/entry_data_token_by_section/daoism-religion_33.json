    "main_text": "Views of the Human Body || Main Components and Loci\n7.3 Main Components and Loci\n\nIn addition to the different models outlined above, the Daoist view of\nthe body is grounded on several components and loci that are not\nphysical in the ordinary sense, or that perform functions going beyond\nthose of the corresponding physical organs. The three main\ncomponents\u2014jing or \u201cessence\u201d, qi\nor \u201cbreath\u201d, and shen or\n\u201cspirit\u201d\u2014have been discussed above\n (\u00a74.2).\n Only a few of the others will be mentioned here.\n\nThe center of the human being is represented in different ways; and\nnot being material, it may have different symbolic locations and\nnames. Most important among them is the Heart (xin, a word\nalso meaning \u201ccenter\u201d). Related images and terms include\nthe Yellow Court and the Mysterious-Female. The Yellow Court\n(huangting, where \u201cyellow\u201d is the color of the\ncentral agent Soil, and the \u201ccourt\u201d is the central\ncourtyard in traditional Chinese houses) has different\ndefinitions. When the framework of reference is the three Cinnabar\nFields, it may denote any of them, and especially the central one,\ncorresponding to the heart; when it is the five agents, it denotes the\nspleen, which is placed at the center of the five viscera and\ncorresponds to Soil. The Mysterious-Female (xuanpin, a term\nderived from the Daode jing and often translated as\n\u201cmysterious female\u201d) is the immaterial locus of the\nconjunction of Yin (the \u201cfemale\u201d) and Yang (the\n\u201cmysterious\u201d).\n\nThe three Cinnabar Fields (dantian) are the lower Cinnabar\nField (the dantian proper), which is found in the region of\nthe abdomen and is the seat of the Essence (jing); the middle\nCinnabar Field, which is found in the region of the heart and is the\nseat of Breath (qi); and the upper Cinnabar Field, which is\nfound in the region of the brain and is the seat of Spirit\n(shen). In meditation practices, the three Fields are the\nresidences of the Three Ones (Sanyi), who represent the One and its\nsubdivision into the Two. In Neidan (Internal Alchemy, on which see\n \u00a710.3),\n they are the loci of the conception, nourishment, and delivery of the\nalchemical embryo.\n\nImportant symbolic functions are performed by the five viscera\n(wuzang), namely the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and\nkidneys. They are related, in this order, to the agents Wood, Fire,\nSoil, Metal, and Water. This makes the viscera the main support for\nthe macrocosm-microcosm doctrine in Daoism. The three Cinnabar Fields\nand the five viscera respectively reproduce the vertical and\nhorizontal dimensions of the cosmos within the human being.\n\nMany Daoist texts also refer to the hun and the po,\ntwo untranslatable terms often rendered as \u201cspiritual and\nmaterial souls\u201d, \u201ccelestial and\nearthly souls\u201d, or in similar ways. The hun stands for\nthe Yang and lighter components of the human\nbeing that pertain to Heaven and return there after death. The\npo stands for the Yin and grosser\ncomponents that pertain to the Earth and return there when death\noccurs. According to different views, the hun and the\npo may be single or multiple; in the latter case, the\nhun are three, and the po are seven.\n\nFinally, the human body also hosts two sets of parasites: the\n\u201cthree corpses\u201d (sanshi), which reside in the\nhead, the chest, and the legs; and the \u201cnine worms\u201d\n(jiuchong), which live in different parts of the body. All of\nthem cause weakening, diseases, and death. The \u201cthree\ncorpses\u201d are also said to report periodically one\u2019s\ntransgressions to Heaven, which results in the shortening of\none\u2019s life span. As these parasites feed on cereals,\n\u201cabstaining from grains\u201d (bigu) was one of the\nways to expel them.\n",
