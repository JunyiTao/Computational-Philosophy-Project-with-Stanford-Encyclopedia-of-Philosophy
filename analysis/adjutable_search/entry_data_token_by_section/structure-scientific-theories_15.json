    "main_text": "The Pragmatic View || A Running Example: Newtonian Mechanics\n4.2 A Running Example: Newtonian Mechanics\n\nCartwright has done much to develop a Pragmatic View. Start by\nconsidering Newton\u2019s second law: \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\nF = ma\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(F\\) is the resultant force on a mass \\(m\\), and \\(a\\) is the\nnet acceleration of \\(m\\); both \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) are vectors. This law\nis considered a \u201cgeneral\u201d (Cartwright 1999a, 187) law\nexpressed with \u201cabstract quantities\u201d (Cartwright 1999b,\n249). Newton\u2019s second law can be complemented with other laws,\nsuch as (i) Hooke\u2019s law for an ideal spring: \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\nF = -kx\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(k\\) is the force constant of the spring, and \\(x\\) the distance\nalong the x-axis from the equilibrium position, and (ii)\nCoulomb\u2019s law modeling the force between two charged\nparticles: \n\n\\[\\tag{3}\nF = K \\frac{qq'}{r^2}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(K\\) is Coulomb\u2019s electrical constant, \\(q\\) and \\(q'\\)\nare the charges of the two objects, and \\(r\\) the distance between the\ntwo objects. The picture Cartwright draws for us is that\nNewton\u2019s, Hooke\u2019s, and Coulomb\u2019s laws are abstract,\nleaving out many details. They can be used to derive mathematical\nmodels of concrete systems. For instance, by combining (1) and (2),\nthe law of gravitation (a \u201cfundamental\u201d law, Cartwright\n1983, 58\u201359), other source laws, and various simplifying\nassumptions, we might create a model for the orbit of Mars, treating\nthe Sun and Mars as a 2-body system, ignoring the other planets,\nasteroids, and Mars\u2019 moons. Indeed, the Solar System is a\npowerful \u201cnomological machine\u201d (Cartwright 1999a,\n50\u201353), which \u201cis a fixed (enough) arrangement of\ncomponents, or factors, with stable (enough) capacities that in the\nright sort of stable (enough) environment will, with repeated\noperation, give rise to the kind of regular behaviour that we\nrepresent in our scientific laws\u201d (Cartwright 1999a, 50).\nImportantly, most natural systems are complex and irregular, and\ncannot be neatly characterized as nomological machines. For these\ncases, abstract laws \u201crun out\u201d (Cartwright 1983) and are\nrarely smoothly \u201cdeidealised\u201d (Su\u00e1rez 1999). In\ngeneral, abstract laws predict and explain only within a given domain\nof application, and only under ideal conditions. More concrete laws or\nmodels are not directly deduced from them (e.g., Su\u00e1rez 1999,\nSu\u00e1rez and Cartwright 2008), and they can rarely be combined to\nform effective \u201csuper-laws\u201d (Cartwright 1983,\n70\u201373). In short, the move from (1) and (2) or from (1) and (3)\nto appropriate phenomenological models, is not fully specified by\neither abstract law pairing. Indeed, Cartwright developed her notion\nof \u201ccapacities\u201d to discuss how \u201cthe principles of\nphysics\u201d \u201care far better rendered as claims about\ncapacities, capacities that can be assembled and reassembled in\ndifferent nomological machines, unending in their variety, to give\nrise to different laws\u201d (1999a, 52). Articulating concrete\nmodels requires integrating a mix of mathematical and nonformal\ncomponents. Laws (1), (2), and (3) remain only one component, among\nmany, of the models useful for, e.g., exploring the behavior of the\nSolar System, balls on a pool table, or the behavior of charges in\nelectrical fields.\n\nShifting examples but not philosophical research program,\nSu\u00e1rez and Cartwright (2008) explains how analogies such as\nsuperconductors as diamagnets (as opposed to ferromagnets) were an\nintegral part of the mathematical model of superconductivity developed\nby Fritz and Heinz London in the 1930s (63; cf. London and London\n1935). Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright gladly accept that this model\n\u201cis uncontroversially grounded in classic electromagnetic\ntheory\u201d (64). However, contra Semantic View Structuralists such\nas Bueno, da Costa, French, and Ladyman, they view nonformal aspects\nas essential to practices of scientific modeling and theorizing:\n\u201cThe analogy [of diamagnets] helps us to understand how the\nLondons work with their model\u2026 which assumptions they add and\nwhich not\u2026 a formal reconstruction of the model on its own\ncannot help us to understand that\u201d (69). In short, the running\nexample of Newtonian mechanics, in conjunction with a glimpse into the\nuse of analogies in mathematical modeling, illustrates the Pragmatic\nView\u2019s account of theory syntax: theory is constituted by a\nplurality of formal and informal components.\n",
