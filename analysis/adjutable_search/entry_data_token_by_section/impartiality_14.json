    "main_text": "Partiality and Impartiality || Relationships and the Justification of Partiality\n6.1 Relationships and the Justification of Partiality\n\nWhile some philosophers reject the moral significance of partiality\naltogether, holding that morality is both fundamentally and thoroughly\nimpartial, many agree with Nagel (1991) that morality includes both\npartial and impartial elements, and that neither is reducible to the\nother. In particular, the context of \u201cspecial\u201d or\n\u201cpersonal\u201d relationships constitutes an area in which it\nseems plausible to many to think that partiality to certain people is\nnot frequently permissible and sometimes morally admirable and/or\nobligatory. There is, however, no generally accepted account of what\njustifies partiality in this area.\n\nOne influential account of partiality\u2019s justification appeals to\nthe value of personal projects. Since personal projects and/or the\nability to pursue personal projects are important, and since agents\nwho were required to be completely impartial in every aspect of life\nwould be unable to pursue such projects, we should allow that people\nare not required to be absolutely impartial in every aspect of life.\nBernard Williams (1981) famously argues that at least some of an\nagent\u2019s projects \u2013 he calls them \u201cground\nprojects\u201d \u2013 are fundamental components of the\nagent\u2019s identity, and an agent who gives them up, because she is\nrequired to do so by morality, or for any other reason, will find\nherself with no reason to be moral, to go on living, or to do anything\nat all. Other philosophers, including Wolf (1992; see also 1982),\nMacIntyre (1984), Sandel (1982), and Stroud (2010) also base the\njustification of partiality on the value and significance of personal\nprojects and commitments. (For Sandel and MacIntyre this means,\nlargely, commitments to the political community that has formed\none\u2019s identity and to which one owes one\u2019s\nallegiance.)\n\nA second possible account sees our personal relationships as the\nsource of partiality\u2019s justification. Kolodny (2003) argues that\npersonal relationships bear \u201cfinal value\u201d and that this\ngrounds special obligations toward those people to whom we are\nrelated. Similarly, Scheffler (2004), argues that valuing a\nrelationship non-instrumentally necessarily involves seeing it as\ngiving rise to certain reasons that will be partial in nature. A\nvariation on this sort of view agrees that relationships are\nsignificant but suggests that we should view reasons, rather than\nvalue, as fundamental. On such views our reasons for giving\npreferential treatment to those to whom we are related are not\ngrounded in the value of those relationships and indeed need not be\nreduced to or grounded in anything else at all; they carry inherent\nand irreducible normative significance. Views of this sort are put\nforward by Scanlon (1998) and Jeske (2008).\n\nKeller (2013) criticizes both the projects-based view and the\nrelationship-based view, and argues instead for a third alternative,\nwhich he calls \u201cthe individuals view.\u201d According to the\nindividuals view, reasons that justify the special treatment of those\nto whom we are related \u201carise from facts about the individuals\nwith whom our special relationships are shared\u201d (79). Rather\nthan acting as reasons for treating those persons better than others,\nour relationships act as enablers \u2013that is, background\nconditions that explain why some facts count as reasons for a given\nagent. (Keller borrows the idea of an enabler, and the term, from\nJonathan Dancy; see especially Dancy (2004). For similar views, which\nalso draw on Dancy\u2019s work, see Jollimore (2011) and Lord\n(2016).)\n\nThe question of how to justify partiality to friends, relatives,\nintimates, and others to whom we bear \u201cspecial\u201d\nrelationships has implications for many questions concerning\nimpartiality and our broader obligations, and to the issue of who gets\nincluded in the community of moral recognition. Consider, for\ninstance, the moral questions that arise with respect to our treatment\nof non-human animals. While it may once have been plausible (or\ngenerally regarded as such) to see the fact that a given organism\nbelonged to the human species as indicating that it possessed\nintrinsic properties grounding a special moral status, and hence was\nentitled to better forms of treatment than \u201cmere\u201d animals\nwere entitled to, such a view is no longer clearly defensible.\nAccordingly, in recent decades many consequentialists have used some\nform of \u201cmarginal cases\u201d argument to argue that we have\nmore moral obligations to non-human animals than has generally been\nrecognized. If we would object to killing and eating a human\nindividual for food\u2014even a severely cognitively disabled human\nindividual who is, say, no more intelligent than the average\npig\u2014how can we justify killing and eating pigs for food? How we\nthink about marginal cases arguments, and obligations to non-humans,\nwill likely reflect what we think regarding the nature of partiality\nto particular humans. Holding some version of the individuals view,\nfor instance, would seem to lend support to the common\nconsequentialist contention that obligations to individuals (whether\nhuman or non-human) must depend on the intrinsic qualities of those\nindividuals, rather than on our relations to them. Thus, to eject some\nindividual from the community of moral recognition merely because it\nbelongs to a different species, and not our own, would constitute a\nviolation of moral impartiality at least somewhat comparable to\nregarding some human as not worthy of moral consideration\nbecause they belonged to a different ethnic group (Singer 1974; see\nalso McMahan 2002, 218\u201328).\n\nOther philosophers, by contrast, have endorsed a version of the\nrelationship-based view with respect to our moral duties to humans and\nnon-human animals, holding that we have special obligations to the\nformer, and not to the latter, in something like the way we have\nspecial obligations to distant relatives. When Bernard Williams\nwrites, \u201cThere are certain respects in which creatures are\ntreated one way rather than another simply because they belong to a\ncertain category, the human species,\u201d he is not merely\ndescribing but endorsing the view that species membership is relevant,\nat least for human beings (Williams 2008, 142). Similarly, T.M.\nScanlon sees his contractualism as justifying the significance of\nsuch ties, writing that \u201cThe mere fact that a being is \u2019of\nhuman born\u2019 provides a strong reason for according it the same\nstatus as other humans. This has sometimes been characterized as a\nprejudice, called \u2018speciesism.\u2019 But it is not prejudice to\nhold that our relation to these beings gives us reason to accept the\nrequirement that our actions should be justifiable to them. Nor is it\nprejudice to recognize that this particular reason does not apply to\nother beings with comparable capacities, whether or not there are\nother reasons to accept this requirement with regard to them\u201d\n(Scanlon 1998, 185). (See also Diamond 1991, 2018.)\n\nOf course, it is perfectly possible to hold a relationship-based view\nof partiality to special relations while rejecting the claim that\nmembership in the same species constitutes the relevant sort of\nrelationship\u2014just as many who think being A\u2019s\nfriend grounds special obligations toward A might reject the view\nthat belonging to the same ethnic group as A does so as well.\n(The challenge, as always, is to explain what kinds of relationships\ndo ground obligations, and which do not. (Kolodny, 2010a) provides\nsome helpful discussion and defends a proposal for where and how to\ndraw the line.) By the same token, a commitment to the idea that\nlegitimate special obligations (those to friends, for instance) are\ngrounded by some version of the individuals view leaves it quite open\nprecisely which qualities of one\u2019s friends do the\ngrounding, and just how the grounding relation is conditioned by the\nexistence of the friendship. Merely knowing, then, that someone holds\nthe relationship view, the individuals view, etc, does not in\nitself tell us much about whether they endorse obligations to\nnon-humans. Still, their ultimate view on that matter, whatever it\nmight be, will inevitably be influenced by their position regarding\nthe nature and grounding of special obligations and other forms of\npartiality. The of justifying partiality toward intimates and\nrelatives, then, is by no means an abstract or inconsequential one, as\nour views on such matters bear on such larger questions as who gets\nincluded in, and who ends up excluded from, the community of moral\nconsiderability.\n",
