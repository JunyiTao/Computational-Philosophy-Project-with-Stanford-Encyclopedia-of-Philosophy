    "main_text": "Cartesian Foundations || Metaphysics\n2.2 Metaphysics\n\nIn the second part of De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9,\nPoulain claims that \u201cthe mind has no sex\u201d and loosely\nconnects his claim to Descartes\u2019 dualism (T1en 157\u2013158;\nTTfr 99\u2013100). The claim in itself was not new\u2014we find it\nalready in the theological doctrine of Augustine, who holds that the\nrational souls of women and men are equally created in the image of\nGod (De trinitate XII 7.12), and in Poulain\u2019s time it had recently been stated,\nwith strong feminist emphasis, by Marie le Jars de Gournay (G-EMW 65;\nG-OC 978). Still, many of Poulain\u2019s contemporaries as well as\nmodern scholars agree that Descartes\u2019 dualism strengthened the\nidea that the mind has no sex (different positions have been argued by\nHoffmann 1969; Perry 1985; Harth 1992: 81\u201386; Atherton 1993;\nO\u2019Neill 1999 and 2011; Broad 2002: 4\u201312 and 2017;\nPellegrin 2011: 28\u201337 and 2019: 568\u2013569; Reuter 2013 and\n2019: 38\u201341; Detlefsen 2017). It might seem surprising that\nPoulain does not make more out of Descartes\u2019 dualism than he\nactually does.\n\nIn the passage in question, Poulain points out that if \u201cthe mind\nis considered in itself, it [\u2026] have the same nature in all\nhuman beings\u201d (T1en 158; TTfr 100). In order to consider the\nmind in itself one has to presuppose that it can in some respect be\ndistinguished from the body, but Poulain does not discuss the\nmetaphysical nature of the relation between mind and body. Instead he\nleaves the discussion of the mind considered in itself behind and\nfocuses on the mind-body union, which he describes in the following\nwords:\n\n\nIt is God who unites the mind with the body of a woman as with that of\na man, and who unites them by means of the same laws. This union is\nestablished and maintained by sensations, passions, and acts of the\nwill; and since the mind acts in the same way in both sexes, it is\nequally capable of the same things in both of them. (T1en 158; TTfr\n101)\n\n\nThis description is indeed very close to the description Descartes\ngives in the Sixth Meditation, when he examines \u201cwhat God has\nbestowed on me as a combination of mind and body\u201d (CSM II, 57;\nAT VII, 82), but whereas Descartes begins this last Meditation by\nemphasizing the real distinction between mind and body, according to\nwhich it \u201cis certain that I am really distinct from my body, and\ncan exist without it\u201d (CSM II, 54; AT VII, 78), Poulain does not\ndiscuss the real distinction between mind and body before he focuses\non their union.\n\nPoulain\u2019s focus on the mind-body union is continued in De\nl\u2019\u00e9ducation, where the fourth conversation stages a\ndetailed discussion of self-knowledge. Here the young Timander, who is\nusually a spokesperson of Scholastic views, raises a significantly\nCartesian objection. He points out that \n\n\nit would be easier to begin with the study of the mind. For if it is\neasier for man to know himself and what immediately surrounds him than\nwhat is remote from him [as has been previously established], by the\nsame token it seems that the mind would know itself better than it\nwould know the body. (TTen 214; TTfr 246; see also Welch 2002b: 139)\n\n\n\nTimander\u2019s point resembles Descartes\u2019 emphasis in the\nSecond Meditation, where he begins by examining himself as a thinking\nthing (CSM II, 19; AT VII, 28), but rather than following this order\nof metaphysical inquiry, Stasimachus points out that though this is\ntrue \n\n\nprovided one can separate the mind from the body [\u2026] if we\nconsider them a single, interdependent entity [\u2026] I am\nconvinced that knowledge of the body should precede that of the mind.\n(TTen 214: TTfr 246) \n\n\nAgain, Poulain proceeds directly to a study of the mind-body union and\nhere his reference to the distinction between mind and body is even\nmore fleeting than in De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n\nThe lack of any explicit discussion of the soul as a distinct\nsubstance has led Desmond Clarke to argue that Poulain rejected\nDescartes\u2019 notion of the soul as a substance and held this\nnotion to be a mere Scholastic residue. According to Clarke, Poulain\ndefended the view that the \n\n\nunion of the body and the soul and their reciprocal interdependence\nwas a more fundamental datum of human experience than the speculative\ndistinction of the soul as a scholastic substance. (Clarke 2013: 43)\n\n\n\nFollowing the same line of inquiry Marie-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique\nPellegrin argues that for Poulain \u201canthropology is more decisive\nthan metaphysics\u201d (Pellegrin 2019: 576).\n\nPoulain\u2019s emphasis on the embodied aspect of human nature was\nnot unique among his contemporary Cartesians, on the contrary, he\nshares it with Jacques Rohault and Louis de la Forge, for example, who\nare both mentioned in his list of suggested readings presented in\nDe l\u2019\u00e9ducation (TTen 237; TTfr 272). Some\ninfluence is very likely and Clarke compares Poulain\u2019s above\ncited account of the mind-body union in De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 with the account de la Forge gives\nin his Traitt\u00e9 de l\u2019Esprit de l\u2019Homme\n[Treatise on the Human Mind] (1666) (T1en 158n45).\nStill, we must note that while stressing the union, de la\nForge\u2019s account was firmly anchored in substance dualism and his\naim was to address\u2014within a strictly Cartesian\nframework\u2014unsolved problems related to the operations of the\nmind and the interaction between mind and body (Drieux 2019).\n\nPoulain\u2019s unorthodox Cartesianism is most evident when he\ndescribes the relation between individual thoughts and the body. In\nDe l\u2019\u00e9ducation, Poulain writes that \u201call\nthe actions of the mind [\u2026] depend on the participation of the\nbody\u201d and a few pages later, less rigorously, that \u201cone\nalmost never acts without the other\u201d (TTen 213, 223; TTfr 244,\n256). These claims overlook the distinction Descartes makes between\nthe actions and the passions of the mind, according to which passions\ndepend on the body whereas actions, such as volitions, do not (CSM I,\n335; AT XI, 342\u2013343; for more detail see Reuter 2013:\n79\u201382). Poulain does acknowledge the distinction between\nvolitions and passions in one passage in De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, where he writes:\n\n\nAs for the causes that quicken the passions, we can understand their\nworkings as soon as we have studied physics sufficiently to understand\nhow the things that surround us affect us and influence us, and\nthrough experience and use how we can yoke our will to them or\ndissociate it from them. (TTen 84; TTfr 102; see also Broad 2017:\n76)\n\n\nThis passage relies on Descartes\u2019 dualism by distinguishing\nbetween the passions, that are dependent on the body, and the will,\nthat is free to either yoke or dissociate itself. But again there is\nno further discussion and Poulain seems to be unaware of the\nmetaphysical dimension of the distinction he makes.\n\nPoulain does not seem to hold that there is a necessary\ndependence of mind upon body. He is not explicitly arguing for a\nmaterialist alternative to Descartes\u2019 dualism, but rather\nemphasizing the interdependence between mind and body, without taking\nan explicit stand on what kind of metaphysical foundation this\ninteraction requires. Poulain was young when he wrote his feminist\ntreatises and though he was evidently familiar with a wide range of\nCartesian topics, it is possible that he was not very deeply read in\nthe Cartesian corpus. Compared to other Cartesians such as Rohault, de\nla Forge, Nicolas Malebranche, and Antoine Arnauld, Poulain did not\ncontribute by examining unsolved problems in Descartes\u2019 physics\nand metaphysics. Instead, his unrivalled contribution lies in his\nCartesian analyses of the moral, political, physical, and metaphysical\nrelations between the sexes.\n",
