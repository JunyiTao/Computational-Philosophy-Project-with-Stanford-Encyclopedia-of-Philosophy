    "main_text": "Writings\n2. Writings\n\nOckham\u2019s writings are conventionally divided into two groups:\nthe so called \u201cacademic\u201d writings and the\n\u201cpolitical\u201d ones. By and large, the former were written or\nat least begun while Ockham was still in England, while the latter\nwere written toward the end of Ockham\u2019s Avignon period and\nlater, in\n exile.[9]\n With the exception of his Dialogue, a huge political work,\nall are now available in modern critical editions, and many are now\ntranslated into English, in whole or in\n part.[10]\n The academic writings are in turn divided into two groups: the\n\u201ctheological\u201d works and the \u201cphilosophical\u201d\nones, although both groups are essential for any study of\nOckham\u2019s philosophy.\n\nAmong Ockham\u2019s most important writings are:\n\nAcademic Writings\n\n\nTheological Works\n\n\nCommentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard\n(1317\u201318). Book I survives in an ordinatio or\nscriptum\u2014a revised and corrected version, approved by\nthe author himself for distribution. Books II-IV survive only as a\nreportatio\u2014a transcript of the actually delivered\nlectures, taken down by a \u201creporter,\u201d without benefit of\nlater revisions or corrections by the author.\nSeven Quodlibets (based on London disputations held in\n1322\u201324, but revised and edited in Avignon 1324\u201325).\n \nPhilosophical Works\n\n\nLogical Writings\n\n\nExpositions of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and of\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, On Interpretation, and\nSophistic Refutations (1321\u201324).\nSumma of Logic (c. 1323\u201325). A large, independent\nand systematic treatment of logic and semantics.\nTreatise on Predestination and God\u2019s Foreknowledge with\nRespect to Future Contingents (1321\u201324).\n \nWritings on Natural Philosophy\n\nExposition of Aristotle\u2019s Physics (1322\u201324).\nA detailed, close commentary. Incomplete.\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s Books of the Physics\n(before 1324). Not strictly a commentary, this work nevertheless\ndiscusses a long series of questions arising out of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics.\n \n \n \nPolitical Writings\n\n\nEight Questions on the Power of the Pope\n(1340\u201341).\nThe Work of Ninety Days (1332\u201334).\nLetter to the Friars Minor (1334).\nShort Discourse (1341\u201342).\nDialogue (c. 1334\u201346).\n \n\n\nSeveral lesser items are omitted from the above list.\n",
