    "main_text": "Prison Writings\n3. Prison Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s Prison Notebooks (or Quaderni del\ncarcere) comprise around three thousand pages of thematically\norganized essays, observations and comments, written between 1929 and\n1935 (see QC). A number of his notes were revised over time, which\nindicates they were not written randomly but conformed, in part, to a\nplan. Recent research offers some clue as to the logic and chronology\nof their drafting (see Francioni 1984). Nonetheless, the\nNotebooks were not written for publication and, as a whole,\nthey remain fragmentary with no explicit guide as to how, or in even\nwhat order, the contents might be read.\n\nIn his earliest letters from detention, Gramsci indicated various\nthemes that he hoped to explore, including Italian intellectuals,\ncomparative linguistics, the plays of Pirandello, newspapers and other\nforms of \u201cpopular literature\u201d (GPL: 45\u20136). Later he\nlisted more topics\u2014including historiography, the development of\nthe Italian bourgeoisie, the southern question, common sense, and\nfolklore.\n\nThese cultural and historical headings may appear uncontroversial. But\nthey permitted Gramsci to develop his wider thoughts on the practical\nand intellectual problems that had preoccupied him prior to his\narrest. That included: historical features of the Italian state;\ntheoretical concepts for analyzing the cultural and political\nconditions of class domination; and the organizing principles and\ncharacter of a revolutionary strategy. Freed from the immediate\nconstraints of tactical decisions and their repercussions, Gramsci\ndrew on his humanistic training to extend and deepen his understanding\nof these problems (see Schwarzmantel 2015).\n",
