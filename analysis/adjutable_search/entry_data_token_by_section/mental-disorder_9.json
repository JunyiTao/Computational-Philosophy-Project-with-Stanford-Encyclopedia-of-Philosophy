    "main_text": "The Disorder in Mental Disorder || Dysfunction in Two Stage Analyses\n4.3 Dysfunction in Two Stage Analyses\n\nDysfunction forms a central element of the most widely discussed\nanalytic definition of mental disorder, introduced in\n Section 3.\n The notion of dysfunction applies in two distinct ways in\nWakefield\u2019s harmful dysfunction analysis, one way avowedly\nobjective, and the other not (see\n \u00a74.4).\n In the first, dysfunction occurs in some part or parts of a bodily or\nneural system. That dysfunction in turn causes dysfunction in some\npart or parts of the individual\u2019s social and personal system\n(grounding the normative judgment of harmfulness). The first kind of\ndysfunction permits non-evaluative description, it is supposed.\n\nThe characteristic dysfunction of mental disorder is here part of a\nstandard, idiopathic model, as we saw, with these disabling\ntraits understood as the symptomatic, causal manifestations of an\nunderlying, pathological process. The appropriateness of that model\nfor psychiatric conditions has received persistent critique (see\n \u00a710.1).\n Recent challenges rest on the persuasiveness of network models\n(introduced in\n \u00a74.2),\n where symptomatic dysfunction does not emanate from some disabled\ninner mechanism, but instead emerges piecemeal from interacting\nexperiences that cumulatively build clusters of disabling symptoms out\nof feedback loops (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom &\nCramer 2013). In support of this alternative model is accumulating\nevidence from the social sciences that a range of factors combine to\nbring about disorder: individualistic risk factors, but also aspects\nof the broader context in which the individual finds herself (Bolton\n2010; Kirmayer, Lemelson, & Cummings 2015). A more fundamental\ncritique rejects the dysfunction analysis of disorder, favoring\ninstead a madness-as-strategy account which draws strength from\nadaptionism (Garson 2022; See Section 4.4).\n",
