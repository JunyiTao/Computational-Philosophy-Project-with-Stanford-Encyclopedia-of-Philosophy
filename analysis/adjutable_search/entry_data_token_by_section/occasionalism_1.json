    "main_text": "The History of Occasionalism || Medieval Christian Europe\n1.2 Medieval Christian Europe\n\nThe criticism of positing \u201cnecessary connections\u201d between\ncreaturely powers and their alleged effects also emerged in medieval\nChristian Europe, most notably, in the work of Nicholas of Autrecourt\n(1300\u2013d. after 1350). Autrecourt was a precursor to the general\ncriticism of Scholasticism that swept through Europe in the early\nmodern period, and his critique of our alleged knowledge of causal\nconnections was part of his overall project of critically examining\nthe various knowledge claims within natural philosophy that were\ncentral to Aristotelian scholasticism. But his criticisms might have\nbeen too radical for his time, for he was summoned to the Curia at\nAvignon to answer charges of error and heresy, and in 1347 his\nwritings were publicly burned. He himself is said to have been banned\nfrom lecturing (Weinberg 1964, 267).\n\nSources suggest that Autrecourt was acquainted with the arguments set\nforth by al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (cf. Wolfson 1969, 234\u20138). Thus, it is\nno surprise that Autrecourt presents various arguments that are\nreminiscent of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s. For instance, like\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Autrecourt in one formulation of his criticism\nof necessary connections relies on a dictum that the existence of one\nthing cannot be logically inferred from the existence of another thing\n(Weinburg 1964, 272). Hence Autrecourt held that, unless there were\noverwhelming reasons to the contrary, the default position should be\nto assume the lack of logically necessary connections between two\ndistinct entities.\n\nWe should note, however, that the overall focus of Autrecourt\u2019s\nproject was to persuade us that our various judgments about the\nnatural world, including those concerning genuine causal connections,\nlack certainty, and that we thus ought to suspend judgment in such\nmatters. And it is with this goal in mind that he presented a variety\nof epistemological, metaphysical, and theological arguments to support\nthis skeptical stance toward affirming genuine causality among\ncreatures. Therefore, while Autrecourt\u2019s arguments much resemble\nthe arguments deployed by occasionalists, it is far from clear that\nAutrecourt himself was an occasionalist. For his overall attitude\nseems to have been closer to that of a skeptic, in contrast to the\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d position of the occasionalists, who\nunequivocally denied creaturely causation and affirmed divine\ncausation. In this respect, the often quoted epithet that Autrecourt\nwas \u201cthe fourteenth-century Hume\u201d seems rather appropriate\n(Nadler 1996, 458). If Autrecourt was indeed more skeptical than\ndogmatic about God\u2019s role in nature, we might think that, in the\nWestern philosophical tradition, occasionalists in the proper sense of\nthe term emerge in earnest in the wake of Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) in the form of \u201cCartesian\noccasionalists\u201d.\n [3]\n",
