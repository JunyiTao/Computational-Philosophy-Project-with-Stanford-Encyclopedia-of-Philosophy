    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) was born in Mohrungen in\nEast Prussia. His father was a schoolteacher and he grew up in humble\ncircumstances. In 1762 he enrolled at the University of\nK\u00f6nigsberg, where he studied with Kant, who accorded him special\nprivileges because of his unusual intellectual abilities. At this\nperiod he also began a lifelong friendship with the irrationalist\nphilosopher Hamann. In 1764 he left K\u00f6nigsberg to take up a\nschool-teaching position in Riga. There he wrote the programmatic\nessay How Philosophy Can Become More Universal and Useful for the\nBenefit of the People (1765); published his first major work,\nconcerning the philosophy of language and literature, the\nFragments on Recent German Literature (1767\u20138); and\nalso published an important work on aesthetics, the Critical\nForests (1769). In 1769 he resigned his position and\ntravelled\u2014first to France, and then to Strasbourg, where in 1770\nhe met, and had a powerful impact on, the young Goethe. In 1771 he won\na prize from the Berlin Academy for his best-known work in the\nphilosophy of language, the Treatise on the Origin of\nLanguage (published in 1772). From 1771\u20136 he served as\ncourt preacher to the ruling house in B\u00fcckeburg. The most\nimportant works from this period are the essay Shakespeare\n(1773) and his first major essay on the philosophy of history,\nThis Too a Philosophy of History for the Formation of\nHumanity (1774). In 1776, partly thanks to Goethe\u2019s\ninfluence, he was appointed General Superintendent of the Lutheran\nclergy in Weimar, a post he would keep for the rest of his life.\nDuring this period he published an important essay in the philosophy\nof mind, On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul\n(1778); a seminal work on the Old Testament, On the Spirit of\nHebrew Poetry (1782\u20133); his well-known longer work on the\nphilosophy of history, the Ideas for the Philosophy of History of\nHumanity (1784\u201391); an influential essay on the philosophy\nof religion, God: Some Conversations (1787); a work largely\non political philosophy, written in response to the French Revolution,\nthe Letters for the Advancement of Humanity (1793\u20137); a\nseries of Christian Writings (1794\u20138) concerned with\nthe New Testament; and two works opposing Kant\u2019s critical\nphilosophy, A Metacritique on the Critique of Pure Reason\n(1799) (directed against the theoretical philosophy of the\nCritique of Pure Reason [Kant 1781/7]) and the\nCalligone (1800) (directed against the aesthetics of the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment [Kant 1790]). In addition\nto the works just mentioned, Herder also wrote many others in the\ncourse of his career.\n\nHerder\u2019s earlier works are often his best. He himself wrote in\nOn the Cognition and Sensation (this article will use such\nabbreviated titles throughout) that \u201cthe first uninhibited work\nof an author is \u2026 usually his best; his bloom is unfolding, his\nsoul still dawn\u201d (HPW 219). Whether or not that\nis generally true, it does arguably apply to Herder\nhimself.\n",
