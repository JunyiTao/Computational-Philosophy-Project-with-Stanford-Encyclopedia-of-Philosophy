    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s Psychological Writings\n1. Aristotle\u2019s Psychological Writings\n\n\nAristotle investigates psychological phenomena primarily in De\nAnima and a loosely related collection of short works called the\nParva Naturalia, whose most noteworthy pieces are De\nSensu and De Memoria. He also touches upon psychological\ntopics, often only incidentally, in his ethical, political, and\nmetaphysical treatises, as well as in his scientific writings,\nespecially De Motu Animalium. The works in the Parva\nNaturalia are, in comparison with De Anima, empirically\noriented, investigating, as Aristotle says, \u201cthe phenomena common\nto soul and body\u201d (De Sensu 1, 436a6\u20138). This contrasts\nwith De Anima, which introduces as a question for\nconsideration \u201cwhether all affections are common to what has the\nsoul or whether there is some affection peculiar to the soul\nitself\u201d (De Anima i 1, 402a3\u20135). That is, in De\nAnima Aristotle wants to know whether all psychological states are\nalso material states of the body. \u201cThis,\u201d he remarks,\n\u201cit is necessary to grasp, but not easy\u201d (De Anima\ni 1, 402a5). In this way, De Anima proceeds at a higher level\nof abstraction than the Parva Naturalia. It is generally more\ntheoretical, more self-conscious about method, and more alert to\ngeneral philosophical questions about perception, thinking, and\nsoul-body relations.\n\n\nIn both De Anima and the Parva Naturalia,\nAristotle assumes something which may strike some of his modern readers\nas odd. He takes psychology to be the branch of science which\ninvestigates the soul and its properties, but he thinks of the soul as\na general principle of life, with the result that Aristotle\u2019s\npsychology studies all living beings, and not merely those he regards\nas having minds, human beings. So, in De Anima, he takes it as\nhis task to provide an account of the life activities of plants and\nanimals, along side those of humans (De Anima ii 11, 423a20\u20136,\ncf. ii 1, 412a13; cf. De Generatione Animalium ii 3, 736b13;\nDe Partibus Animalium iv 5, 681a12). In comparison with the\nmodern discipline of Psychology, then, Aristotle\u2019s psychology is broad\nin scope. He even devotes attention to the question of the nature of\nlife itself, a subject which falls outside the purview of psychology in\nmost contemporary contexts. On Aristotle\u2019s approach, psychology studies\nthe soul (psuch\u00ea in Greek, or anima in Latin);\nso it naturally investigates all ensouled or animate beings.\n\n\nThere is, however, one telling point of contact between Aristotle\u2019s\ninvestigations into the soul and the contemporary discipline of\nPsychology: in each case, different questions yield different\ndirections and methods of inquiry, with the result that it is sometimes\nhard to appreciate how so many variegated enterprises, though conducted\nunder one and the same rubric, could really belong to any one\ncoordinated discipline. Someone studying methods of Freudian\npsychoanalysis will not, after all, have any immediate overlap of\neither interest or method with a brain physiologist or a behavioral\ngeneticist. In a similar way, Aristotle seems reluctant to regard an\ninquiry into the soul as belonging exclusively to natural science,\nwhich is for him the branch of theoretical science devoted to\ninvestigating beings capable of undergoing change. (He contrasts\n\u201cphysics\u201d, that is, natural science, with both mathematics and \u201cfirst\nphilosophy\u201d along these lines; Meta. vi 1 1025b27\u201330, 1026a18;\nxi 7 1064a16\u201319, b1\u20133.) On the one hand, he insists that because\nvarious psychological states, including anger, joy, courage, pity,\nloving, and hating, all involve the body in central and obvious ways,\nthe study of soul \u201cis already in the province of the natural scientist\u201d\n(De Anima i 1 403a16\u201328). At the same time, however, he\ninsists that the mind or intellect (nous) may not be enmeshed\nin the body in the same way as these sorts of states, and so denies\nthat the study of soul falls in its entirety to the natural scientist\n(Meta. vi 1 1026a4\u20136; De Partibus Animalium i 1\n645a33-b10). This is presumably why in the opening chapter of De\nAnima Aristotle reports a deep and authentic perplexity about the\nbest method for investigating psychological matters (De Anima\ni 1 402a16\u201322). If different sciences employ different methods and the\nstudy of soul is bifurcated so that it belongs to no one science, there\nwill indeed be a genuine difficulty about how best to proceed in any\ninquiry concerning it. It seems fair to say that these sorts of\nquandaries have not left us altogether. Although purely naturalistic\napproaches to philosophy of mind have found staunch champions in\ncontemporary times, it would nevertheless be safe to say that much of\nthe discipline continues to employ traditional a priori\nmethods; some branches of cognitive science seem an admixture of both.\nIn any case, in view of the difficulties concerning the soul he\nenumerates, Aristotle evinces an appropriate modesty when undertaking\nits investigation: \u201cGrasping anything trustworthy concerning the soul\nis completely and in every way among the most difficult of affairs\u201d\n(De Anima i 1 402a10\u201311).\n\n  See the supplementary document Method in Psychology.\n  \n",
