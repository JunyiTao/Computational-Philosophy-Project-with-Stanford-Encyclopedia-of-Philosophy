    "main_text": "Third Case Study: The Regress Problem\n3. Third Case Study: The Regress Problem\n\nThe problem of induction challenges our inferences from the observed\nto the unobserved. The regress problem challenges our knowledge at an\neven more fundamental level, questioning our ability to know anything\nby observation in the first place (see Weintraub 1995 for a critical\nanalysis of this distinction).\n\nTo know something, it seems you must have some justification for\nbelieving it. For example, your knowledge that Socrates taught Plato\nis based on testimony and textual sources handed down through the\nyears. But how do you know these testimonies and texts are reliable\nsources? Presumably this knowledge is itself based on some further\njustification\u2014various experiences with these sources, their\nagreement with each other, with other things you\u2019ve observed\nindependently, and so on. But the basis of this knowledge too can be\nchallenged. How do you know that these sources even say what you think\nthey say, or that they even exist\u2014maybe every experience\nyou\u2019ve had reading The Apology has been a mirage or a\ndelusion.\n\nThe famous Agrippan trilemma identifies three possible ways this\nregress of justification might ultimately unfold. First, it could go\non forever, with \\(A\\) justified by \\(B\\) justified by \\(C\\) justified\nby \u2026, ad infinitum. Second, it it could cycle back on\nitself at some point, with \\(A\\) justified by \\(B\\) justified by \\(C\\)\njustified by\u2026justified by \\(B\\), for example. Third and\nfinally, the regress might stop at some point, with \\(A\\) justified by\n\\(B\\) justified by \\(C\\) justified by\u2026justified by \\(N\\), which\nis not justified by any further belief.\n\nThese three possibilities correspond to three classic responses to\nthis regress of justification. Infinitists hold that the regress goes\non forever, coherentists that it cycles back on itself, and\nfoundationalists that it ultimately terminates. The proponents of each\nview reject the alternatives as unacceptable. Infinitism looks\npsychologically unrealistic, requiring an infinite tree of beliefs\nthat finite minds like ours could not accommodate. Coherentism seems\nto make justification unacceptably circular, and thus too easy to\nachieve. And foundationalism seems to make justification arbitrary,\nsince the beliefs at the end of the regress apparently have no\njustification.\n\nThe proponents of each view have long striven to answer the concerns\nabout their own view, and to show that the concerns about the\nalternatives cannot be adequately answered. Recently, methods from\nformal epistemology have begun to be recruited to examine the adequacy\nof these answers. We\u2019ll look at some work that\u2019s been done\non coherentism and foundationalism, since these have been the focus of\nboth informal and formal work. (For work on infinitism, see Turri and\nKlein 2014. See Haack (1993) for a hybrid option,\n\u201cfoundherentism\u201d.)\n",
