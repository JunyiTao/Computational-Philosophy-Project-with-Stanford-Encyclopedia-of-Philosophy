    "main_text": "Anti-imperialism and national self-determination\n4. Anti-imperialism and national self-determination\n\n\nThe focus on the development of noncapitalist areas of the world gave\nLuxemburg a sensitivity to questions of race, ethnicity, and\nindigenous rights that was uncharacteristic for the Marxism of her\ntime. Up to that point, several Marxists had more or less shared the\nteleological scheme defended by many Enlightenment philosophers that\ncharacterised the process of societal evolution as a transition\nthrough different stages of development. Starting with nomadic\n(hunter-gathering) forms of life, who were then supplanted by pastoral\nthen agricultural relations, these conjectural histories usually\nculminated with commercial societies, often considered to be a\nsuperior form of social organisation. Luxemburg was one of the\npioneers of a study of racism and cultural appropriation as\ndistinctive yet integrated components of an analysis of capitalism\nwhere exploitation and racial subordination are mutually\nreinforcing. \u201cThe progress of the humanistic era of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, she remarked sarcastically while commenting on\nGerman colonialism at the end of the 18th century, could be seen in\nhow the captain of a ship transporting slaves from Guinea to Guyana in\nSouth America, \u201cto alleviate their [the slaves] melancholy and\nto keep them from dying off, allowed them to dance on the ship\u2019s\ndeck with music and whip cracks every evening, something to which the\nmore brutal Spanish traders had not resorted\u201d (Luxemburg 1910\n[CW: 209]).\n\n\nIn the manuscript on the Introduction to the Critique of Political\nEconomy based on her lectures at the SPD school and published\npostuhumously, Luxemburg examined at length primitive communism in\nsocieties as diverse as Germanic tribes, the Inca empire, British\nIndia, French Algeria, and Russia. She illustrated how collective\nforms of land ownership had an extraordinary capacity for tenacity and\nadaptation to changing historical circumstances, showing enduring\nresilience towards despotism, foreign rule, outside conquest and\nexploitation. There was only one contact, Luxemburg pointed out, that\nthose societies could not withstand: \u201cthe contact with European\ncivilisation, i.e. with capitalism\u201d. This encounter, she wrote,\nis \u201cdeadly, universally and without exception and it\naccomplishes what centuries of the most savage Oriental conquerors\ncould not: the dissolution of the whole social structure from the\ninside, tearing apart all traditional bonds and transforming the\nsociety in a short period of time into a shapeless pile of\nrubble\u201d (Luxemburg 1910 [CW: 227]).\n\n\nIn The Accumulation of Capital, the examples \u2013 of\nBritish colonialism in India, the Opium Wars, French colonialism in\nAlgeria, the struggle between Black African peoples and Dutch Boers,\nthe exploitation of Native Americans \u2013 serve as a reminder of\nhow capitalism develops against a background of coercion and racial\nabuse. At a time in which the German Social Democratic party\ncelebrated its electoral expansion while hesitating to condemn the\ncontribution of Germany to the scramble for Africa, Luxemburg wrote\nseveral articles and pamphlets in which she called attention to the\ngenocide of the Nama and Herero people of Namibia, and criticised the\ncomplicity of Kautsky and the SPD leadership in failing to condemn the\nexpansion of the Kaiser\u2019s imperial projects in Morocco for fear\nof losing parliamentary seats. While remaining committed to the fight\nagainst racism in Europe, as her public pronouncements on the Dreyfus\naffair demonstrate, she continued to see the struggle against\nexclusion within her own state as inextricably linked to the\ncondemnation of the racial abuse perpetuated by imperialist powers\naround the world. Black people in Africa \u201cwith whose bodies the\nEuropeans play a game of catch, are just as near to me\u201d as the\n\u201csuffering of the Jews\u201d, she emphasised (Luxemburg 1917\n[RLR: 390]).\n\n\nThis attention to the global dynamic of capitalist expansion and the\nanalysis of imperialism as an integral part of the development of\ncapital are important to explain Luxemburg\u2019s distinctive stance\non one of the most important questions that concerned the Marxist\nmovement: the desirability of national self-determination. The mutual\ndependence between economic and political power in the presence of\nglobalization and the continous drive to exploit remote areas of the\nworld made Luxemburg a skeptic of theories of political emancipation\nthrough national self-determination.  Here she differed from the\nmainstream Marxist position on national self-determination (including\nVladimir Lenin\u2019s) who had argued in favour of national\nliberation movements when these helped advance socialist goals. For\nLuxemburg, national liberation movements ended up playing into the\nhands of domestic liberal ruling elites and weakening the\ninternational workers\u2019 movement. Taking as an example a question\ncloser to home \u2013 whether Poland ought to gain independence from\nimperial Russia \u2013 she drew on her knowledge and experience to\ndefend strict international proletarianism and suggested that it was\nagainst the interests of the Polish working classes to become a\nself-determining nation. Her argument was that national\nself-determination cannot serve an emancipatory purpose if it is\ndivorced from the international labour movement.  That labour movement\nhowever ought to take a transnational form and not limit itself to a\nformal request for national self-determination since, on the face of\ncapitalist development, the formal defence of sovereignty would simply\nlimit the struggle.\n\n\nAuthors who study Luxemburg\u2019s stance on national\nself-determination believe that her hostility to it stems from\naversion to nationalism. Her argument however was more sophisticated\n(see Brie and Sch\u00fctrumpf 2021). Luxemburg was enthusiastic about\nthe unique contribution of national culture through art or literary\nproducts to the understanding of the historical and social\nspecificities of different nations, as her commentaries on the work of\nPolish poet Adam Mickiewicz make clear (see for a discussion Scott\n2021). However, her appreciation of such distinctive linguistic and\ncultural contributions was always distinguished from the issue of\nnation-state sovereignty \u2013 a positiion which put her at odds\nwith mainstream progressive movements in Congress Poland. While the\ncharge of being a \u201cnational nihilist\u201d may be exaggerated,\nit is fair to say that Luxemburg\u2019s prominence in the Polish\nsocialist movement, imprinted on the SDKP a sectarian tendency which\nmany historians have subsequently criticised for undermining the\nPolish workers\u2019 movement with its distinctive nationalist\ncommitments (Blanc 2017). Luxemburg always maintained that if the\npolitical and economic power of the Polish proletariat were so weighty\nas to make national self-determination a viable alternative, then\nsurely the workers would also have enough power to rebel against\ncapital beyond national boundaries. Given the empirical circumstances\nof Poland, Luxemburg believed that national self-determination was a\ndangerous distraction from the imperative to work with the labour\nmovement to fight the Russian empire and turn it into a socialist\nstate. Without socialist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia,\nshe argued, independence would deepen the exploitation of Polish\nworkers. The demand for national self-determination ran the risk of\nplaying in the hands of liberal ruling elites, distracting Polish\nworkers and turning them from an entity dominated by Russian capital\nto one dominated by Polish capital. This attitude towards nationalism\nis also central to understand her stance against the war, leading to\nher definitive break with German social democracy whom she accused of\njoining forces with nationalist conservatives to support the war\nagainst Russia. As she explained in the 1915 Junius Pamphlet:\n\u201cSo long as capitalist states exist, i.e., so long as\nimperialistic world policies determine and regulate the inner and\nouter life of a nation, there can be no \u2018national\nself-determination\u2019 either in war or in peace\u201d (Luxemburg\n1915 [RLR: 325]).\n",
