Firstly, the deliberation process, to which members\npartly owe their competence\n (Section 4.5),\n can become less fruitful: some bodies are too large for successful\ndeliberation. Secondly, large \u201canonymous\u201d bodies can\ndemotivate members, who feel individually less responsible and spend\nless effort on forming correct judgments. The opposite effect is also\nimaginable: adding members can improve deliberation and motivation.\nBodies can be too small, not just too big (see the debates over\noptimal parliament size, e.g., Elster 2012).\n\nAll this puts a fundamental assumption of jury models into question:\nthe assumption that someone\u2019s judgment and thus competence are\ngroup-independent, hence, for instance, are the same in a 3-member\ngroup (with small-scale deliberation) as in a 333-member group (with\nlarge-scale deliberation). This denies any effects of group dynamics\non judgments.\n\nTo model group-dependence, the event \\(R_{i}\\) that an individual\n\\(i\\) is correct should be replaced by group-size-dependent\ncorrectness events \\(R_{i,n}\\) for all group sizes \\(n\\) such that\n\\(n\\geq i\\) (i.e., such that the group includes \\(i\\)). An individual\n\\(i\\)\u2019s competence, general or specific, becomes a\ngroup-size-dependent quantity, given by \\(P(R_{i,n})\\) or\n\\(P(R_{i,n}|\\mathbf{x})\\), respectively. One might hypothesize that\ncompetence is an initially increasing and subsequently falling\nfunction of \\(n\\), which therefore peaks at some \u201cindividually\noptimal\u201d group size \\(n_{i}\\). If one replaces the ordinary\nassumption of group-independent judgments by the latter hypothesis,\nthen the increasing-reliability conclusion of jury theorems will still\nhold when restricted to group sizes \\(n\\) of at most the individual\noptimum \\(n_{i}\\) of each individual group member \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\).\nThe collectively optimal group size can exceed the individual\noptima of all individuals \\(i\\), because the merits of drawing on many\nminds can outweigh individual competence losses. But the collective\noptimum can become finite, against the increasing-reliability\nhypothesis.\n",
