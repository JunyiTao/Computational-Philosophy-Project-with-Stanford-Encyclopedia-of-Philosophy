    "main_text": "Pragmatist Epistemology || Representations\n4.4 Representations\n\nHaving discussed pragmatists\u2019 emphases upon the activity of\ninquiry and the thickness of experience, we turn to their views about\nthe nature of thought. It has been common for philosophers to assume\nthat the \u2018content\u2019 of a thought, judgment or proposition\nis a kind of intrinsic property that it possesses. Perhaps it\noffers a \u2018picture\u2019 or \u2018idea\u2019 of some state of\naffairs, and we can identify this content simply by reflecting upon\nthe item itself, and its structural properties. All pragmatists have\nrejected this idea as a key driver of an antinaturalistic Cartesian\ndualism. Instead, they have held that the content of a thought,\njudgment or proposition is a matter of the role it fills in our\nactivities of inquiry, and is to be explained by reference to how we\ninterpret it or what we do with it. This shall be illustrated by\nconsidering three particular pragmatist views.\n\nFirst, all of the classic pragmatists identified beliefs and other\nmental states as habits. According to Peirce, our beliefs\n\u2018[g]uide our desires and shape our actions\u2019 (EP1: 114).\nThe content of a belief is determined by its role in determining our\nactions. This was reflected in Peirce\u2019s formulations of his\nPragmatic Maxim. In order to be clear about the content of a concept\nor hypothesis, we must reflect upon its role in determining what we\nshould do in the light of our desires and our background knowledge. In\nRobert Brandom\u2019s terminology, the philosopher \u2018makes\nexplicit\u2019 aspects of our practice that are implicit in our\nhabits and dispositions. The role of tacit habits of reasoning and\nacting in fixing our beliefs and guiding our actions is a theme that\nrecurs in the work of the pragmatists, and is now finding strong\nechoes in recent empirically informed work on \u20184E\u2019\ncognition, which is embodied, embedded, enactive and extended. (For an\naccounts of this research area which explicitly engage classical\npragmatism, see Menary 2007 and Gallagher 2017.)\n\nThe second illustration concerns a passage in which James defended his\naccount of truth by urging that it was the concept used in successful\nscience. He identified the \u2018traditional view\u2019 that, for\nearly scientists, the \u2018clearness, beauty and\nsimplification\u2019 provided by their theories led them to think\nthat they had deciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the\nAlmighty. By contrast, contemporary scientists held that \u2018no\ntheory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any of them may\nfrom some point of view be useful \u2026\u2019. A scientific theory\nwas to be understood as \u2018an instrument: it is designed to\nachieve a purpose\u2014to facilitate action or increase\nunderstanding\u2019 (James 1907: 33). For James and Dewey, this holds\nof all our concepts and theories: we treat them as instruments to be\njudged by how well they achieve their intended purpose.\n\nThe third illustration comes from Peirce\u2019s general theory of\nsigns, or semiotics, which was developed entirely independently\nof the more well-known semiotics of Ferdinand de Saussure, and is one\nof the most original areas of his thought. Peirce\u2019s semiotics\noffers an account of the contents of thoughts as well as language,\nvisual media, music and any other item that can be said to have\nmeaning (for introductions to this area of Peirce\u2019s thought, see\nLiszka 1996; Short 2007). Unlike Saussure, Peirce insisted that the\nsign-relation was essentially triadic in structure,\ncomprising a representation, an object and an interpretation. In other\nwords: a sign is \u2018about\u2019 some object because it is\nunderstood, in subsequent thought, as a sign of that object. This\nsubsequent thought Peirce calls the sign\u2019s\ninterpretant. In understanding or interpreting a sign, we may\nfeel things about it (which at times Peirce called the emotional\ninterpretant), undertake actions that are rational in the light of\nthe sign and the other information we possess (the dynamic\ninterpretant), or an indefinite number of inferences may be drawn\nfrom it (the logical interpretant) (Jappy 2016). Interpretation\nis generally a goal-directed activity and, once again, the content of\na sign is determined by the ways in which we use it (or might do\nso).\n\nA further triadic distinction deriving from Peirce\u2019s theory of\nsigns which has been influential in disciplines from Biology to Media\nStudies holds between three ways in which a sign may pick out its\nobject:\n\n by resembling it (or more generally, by possessing the very\nproperties that the sign aims to signify), e.g. a map\n by indicating it in some brute unmediated fashion, e.g. a\nweather-vane signifying the wind\u2019s direction \n via some arbitrary convention that must be learned, e.g. words in\nEnglish.\n\n\nThese three kinds of signs Peirce termed: icon, index\nand symbol respectively. Meanwhile, the three ways in which a\nsign may give rise to its interpretant were categorised by\nPeirce as:\n\n the rheme (essentially: a term)\n the proposition \n the argument \n\n\nPeirce\u2019s sign theory continued to richly evolve and clarify\nitself right to the end of his life (Jappy 2016; Bellucci 2017),\nalbeit by means of some rather forbidding special-purpose technical\nterminology. \n",
