    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nFrom the birth of the theory of quantum mechanics in 1925/6 to the\noutbreak of war in Europe, a clear orthodoxy emerged in the conceptual\nand ontological framework for understanding quantum theory. Now known\nas the Copenhagen interpretation, this framework embodied the\npositivistic tendencies of Heisenberg and Bohr, and was set opposed to\nthe more realist tendencies of de Broglie, Einstein, and\nSchr\u00f6dinger. It was not until Bell\u2019s theorem in the 1960s,\nand its experimental tests in the 1970s and 1980s, that new energy was\nbreathed into this interpretational debate. However, beginning in the\nmid-1940s, the first suggestions of retrocausality as part of the\nconceptual and ontological framework in quantum theory had already\nmaterialized.\n\nThere are two key ideas that punctuate the historical development of\nthe notion of retrocausality in quantum mechanics. The first proposal\nof retroactive influence in quantum mechanics comes from a suggestion\nmade by Wheeler and Feynman (1945, 1949). They were led to this idea\nwhile considering the potentially classical origins of some of the\ndifficulties of quantum theory. Consider the following problem from\nclassical electrodynamics: an accelerating electron emits\nelectromagnetic radiation and, through this process, the acceleration\nof the electron is damped. Various attempts to account for this\nphenomenon in terms of the classical theory of electrodynamics lacked\neither empirical adequacy or a coherent physical interpretation.\nWheeler and Feynman attempted to remedy this situation by\nreinterpreting Dirac\u2019s (1938) theory of radiating electrons.\n\nThe core of Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s proposed \u201cabsorber\ntheory of radiation\u201d is a suggestion that the process of\nelectromagnetic radiation emission and absorption should be thought of\nas an interaction between a source and an absorber rather than as an\nindependent elementary process. (This idea has its roots as far back\nas Tetrode 1922 and G. Lewis 1926.) Wheeler and Feynman imagine an\naccelerated point charge located within an absorbing system and\nconsider the nature of the electromagnetic field associated with the\nacceleration. An electromagnetic disturbance can be imagined\n\u201cinitially\u201d to travel outwards from the source to perturb\neach particle of the absorber. The particles of the absorber then\ngenerate together a subsequent field. According to the Wheeler-Feynman\nview, this new field is comprised of half the sum of the retarded\n(forward-in-time) and advanced (backward-in-time) solutions to\nMaxwell\u2019s equations. The sum of the advanced effects of all the\nparticles of the absorber then yields an advanced incoming field that\nis present at the source simultaneous with the moment of emission\n(although see\n \u00a75\n for more on how one should understand this \u201cprocess\u201d).\nThe claim is that this advanced field exerts a finite force on the\nsource which has exactly the required magnitude and direction to\naccount for the observed energy transferred from source to absorber;\nthis is Dirac\u2019s radiative damping field. In addition, when this\nadvanced field is combined with the equivalent half-retarded,\nhalf-advanced field of the source, the total observed disturbance is\nthe full retarded field known empirically to be emitted by accelerated\npoint charges.\n\nThe crucial point to note about the Wheeler-Feynman schema is that due\nto the advanced field of the absorber, the radiative damping\nfield is present at the source at exactly the time of the initial\nacceleration. This schema of advanced and retarded waves now forms the\nbasis for the most fully-formed retrocausal model of quantum\nmechanics, the transactional interpretation (see\n \u00a75).\n\nThe second key idea in the historical development of retrocausality in\nquantum mechanics occurs around the same time as Wheeler and\nFeynman\u2019s absorber theory. French physicist Costa de Beauregard,\na student of de Broglie, noticed a potential objection to the\nreasoning found in Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\u2019s famous paper\n(1935) on the completeness of quantum mechanics (see the entry on\n the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory),\n now widely known as the EPR argument. Einstein et al. argue that\nquantum mechanics must be incomplete on the basis of the following\nassumption: no reasonable definition of reality could be expected to\npermit the reality of some system being dependent upon the process of\nmeasurement carried out on some other distant system which does not in\nany way disturb the first system. The key condition that Einstein et\nal. suggest any reasonable definition of reality should satisfy is\nthat \u201cthere is no longer any interaction between the two\nparts\u201d. (Later, Einstein 1948 accounted for this feature with an\nexplicit assumption of \u201clocality\u201d, see\n \u00a72.2).\n Costa de Beauregard, however, was alert to a particular kind of\nunorthodox alternative to this condition which upended its role in the\nEPR argument. His proposal was that two distant systems could\n\u201cremain correlated by means of a successively advanced and\nretarded wave\u201d (Costa de Beauregard 1953: 1634); that is, one\nsystem could influence, via an advanced wave, the state of the\ncombined systems in their common past, which then, via a retarded\nwave, could influence the state of the distant system in a kind of\n\u201czigzag\u201d through spacetime. This way, there could be a\ndependence between the two distant systems without any \u201cspooky\naction-at-a-distance\u201d. Thus, as Costa de Beauregard (1987b: 252)\nputs it, \n\n\nEinstein of course is right in seeing an incompatibility between his\nspecial relativity theory and the distant quantal correlations, but\nonly under the assumption that advanced actions are\nexcluded.\n\n\nWhen Costa de Beauregard in 1947 suggested this response to the EPR\nargument to his then supervisor de Broglie, de Broglie was \u201cfar\nfrom willing to accept\u201d the proposal (1987b: 252) and forbade\nCosta de Beauregard to publish his unorthodox idea (Price &\nWharton 2015). However, in 1948 Feynman had developed his eponymous\ndiagrams in which antiparticles were to be interpreted as particles\nmoving backward-in-time along the particle trajectories, and so by\n1953 de Broglie had endorsed the publication of Costa de\nBeauregard\u2019s response. On the seeming craziness of the proposal,\nCosta de Beauregard claims, \u201c[t]oday, as the phenomenon of the\nEPR correlations is very well validated experimentally, and is in\nitself a \u2018crazy phenomenon\u2019, any explanation of it must be\n\u2018crazy\u2019\u201d (1987b: 252; see also Costa de Beauregard\n1976, 1977b, 1987a).\n",
