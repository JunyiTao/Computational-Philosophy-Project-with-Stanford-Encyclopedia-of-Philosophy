    "main_text": "Objections to pluralism and responses || Ambiguity\n4.1 Ambiguity\n\n\nSome take pluralists to be committed to the thesis that\n\u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous: since the pluralist thinks that there\nis a range of alethically potent properties (correspondence, coherence,\netc.), \u2018true\u2019 must be ambiguous between these different\nproperties. This is thought to raise problems for pluralists. According\nto one objection, the pluralist appears caught in a grave dilemma.\n\u2018True\u2019 is either ambiguous or unambiguous. If it is, then\nthere is a spate of further problems awaiting (see\n\u00a74.4\u2013\u00a74.6 below). If it is not, then there is only one\nmeaning of \u2018true\u2019 and thus only one property designated by\nit; so pluralism is false.\n\n\nFriends of pluralism have tended to self-consciously distance\nthemselves from the claim that \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous (e.g.,\nWright 1996: 924, 2001; Lynch 2001, 2004b, 2005c). Generally, however,\nthe issue of ambiguity for pluralism has not been well-analyzed. Yet,\none response has been investigated in some detail. According to this\nresponse, the ambiguity of \u2018true\u2019 is simply to be taken as\na datum. \u2018True\u2019 is de facto ambiguous (see, e.g., Schiller\n1906; Pratt 1908; Kaufmann 1948; Lucas 1969; K\u00f6lbel 2002, 2008;\nSher 2005; Wright 2010). Alfred Tarski, for instance, wrote:\n\n\n\nThe word \u2018true\u2019, like other words from our everyday\nlanguage, is certainly not unambiguous. [\u2026] We should reconcile\nourselves with the fact that we are confronted, not with one concept,\nbut with several different concepts which are denoted by one word; we\nshould try to make these concepts as clear as possible (by means of\ndefinition, or of an axiomatic procedure, or in some other way); to\navoid further confusion we should agree to use different terms for\ndifferent concepts [\u2026]. (1944: 342, 355)\n\n\n\nIf \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous de facto, as some authors have\nsuggested, then the ambiguity objection may turn out to\nbe\u2014again\u2014not so much an objection or disconfirmation of the\ntheory, but rather just a datum about \u2018truth\u2019-talk in\nnatural language that should be explained or explained away by theories\nof truth. In that case, pluralists seem no worse off\u2014and possibly\nbetter\u2014than any number of other truth theorists.\n\n\nA second possible line of response from pluralists is that their\nview is not necessarily inconsistent with a monistic account of either\nthe meaning of \u2018true\u2019 or the concept TRUTH. After all,\n\u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous only if it can be assigned more than\none meaning or semantic structure; and it has more than one meaning\nonly if there is more than one stable conceptualization or concept\nTRUTH supporting each numerically distinct meaning. Yet, nothing about\nthe claim that there is more than one way of being true entails, by\nitself, that there is more than one concept TRUTH. In principle, the\nnature of properties like being true\u2014whether homomorphism,\nsuperassertibility, coherence, etc.\u2014may outstrip the concept\nthereof, just as the nature of properties like being water\u2014such\nas H\\(_2\\)O, H\\(_3\\)O, XYZ, etc.\u2014may outstrip the\nconcept WATER (see, e.g., Wright 1996, 2001; Alston 2002; Lynch 2001,\n2005c, 2006). Nor is monism about truth necessarily inconsistent with\nsemantic or conceptual pluralism. The supposition that TRUTH is both\nmany and one (i.e., \u2018moderate monism\u2019) neither rules out\nthe construction of multiple concepts or meanings thereof, nor rules\nout the proliferation of uses to express those concepts or meanings.\nFor example, suppose that the only way of being true turns out to be a\nstructural relation \\(R\\) between reality and certain\nrepresentations thereof. Such a case is consistent with the existence\nof competing conceptions of what \\(R\\) consists in: weak\nhomomorphism, isomorphism, \u2018seriously dyadic\u2019\ncorrespondence, a causal \\(n\\)-place correspondence relation, etc.\nA more sensitive conclusion, then, is just that the objection from\nambiguity is an objection to conceptual or semantic pluralism, not to\nany alethic theory\u2014pluralism or otherwise.\n",
