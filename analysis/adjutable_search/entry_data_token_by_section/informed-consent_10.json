    "main_text": "Informed consent\n4. Informed consent\n\nClinical trials are commonly anticipated by a formalized process in\nwhich participants receive explanations of the purpose, methods,\nrisks, benefits, and alternatives to study participation, as well as\nother matters, before they sign informed consent forms (Beauchamp and\nChildress 2008, 129). Fairly similar processes exist in invasive care.\nBut what is the point of these processes? One of Plato\u2019s\ncharacters mocks doctors who set aside time to keep sick patients\ninformed: \u201cFoolish fellow, \u2026 you are not healing the sick\nman, but you are educating him; and he does not want to be made a\ndoctor, but to get well\u201d (Plato Laws, IV.720a\u2013c,\np. 413). Let us discuss two forms of transgression of the information\nrequirement: (1) lies, deceit, and merely-partial disclosure, and (2)\nthe patient\u2019s failure to comprehend well-presented information.\nWe shall then discuss (3) the content and (4) the cogency of the\ninformation requirement.\n",
