    "main_text": "Beyond Language: Philosophical Applications of Generics || Generics, Stereotyping and Prejudice\n5.1 Generics, Stereotyping and Prejudice\n\nFrom a young age, we conceive of certain kinds, both natural and\nsocial, as having a fundamental, underlying nature that is shared by\nits members (e.g., Gelman 2003). That is, we believe that, while some\nkinds may group individuals together on the basis of superficial\nproperties (as an extreme example, consider the kind\ntrinkets), other kinds group their members together on the\nbasis of deep, intrinsic similarities (animal kinds are paradigmatic\nexamples here). Kinds that fall in the latter category are said to be\nessentialized in the psychological sense. Members of an\nessentialized kind are believed to be deeply similar to each\nother\u2014even if they seem to differ superficially\u2014and are\nbelieved to share a range of important properties, which are the\ncausal upshot of their shared natures (Gelman 2003). In the social\nrealm, essentialist beliefs can be very damaging, and the groups that\nare most highly essentialized often face the worst forms of social\nprejudice (Haslam, Rothschild and Ernst 2000, 2002).\n\nSally Haslanger (2011) offers a fascinating analysis of generics that\nconcern social kinds, for example \u201cwomen are submissive\u201d\n(see also McConnell-Ginet 2012 and Leslie 2014 for related\ndiscussion). It may be a fact that, given social circumstances, the\nmajority of women defer to men on important decisions and life\nchoices. With some complications (as noted above), this sort of high\nprevalence often suffices for a generic to count as true (e.g.,\nPrasada and Dillingham 2006, 2009). Haslanger poses the question: even\nif we are in the circumstances that would plausibly render the generic\ntrue, might there still be something objectionable about uttering the\ngeneric? She argues that indeed there is, if the generic makes\nreference to an essentialized social kind and thereby perpetuates\nvarious forms of oppression. Generics, Haslanger argues, suggest that\nthe property is grounded in the nature of the kind, and so an\nutterance of \u201cwomen are submissive\u201d invites the\ninterpretation that it lies in the very nature of women to be\nsubmissive\u2014rather than their submissiveness coming about as the\nresult of extrinsic, accidental, and changeable social\ncircumstances.\n\nEmpirical evidence supports Haslanger\u2019s hypothesis. For example,\nfrom a young age, we tend to interpret information conveyed via\ngeneric language as indicating a stable and intrinsic property of the\nkind, whether the kind is natural or social (e.g., Cimpian and\nErickson 2012; Cimpian and Markman 2009, 2011). Further, hearing\ngeneric language about a novel social or animal kind leads both\nchildren and adults to essentialize that kind in the first place . For\nexample, even a wholly novel social group, composed of individuals who\nare diverse for race, ethnicity, gender, and age will rapidly be\nessentialized by preschoolers and adults alike if they hear various\nproperties being attributed to the group via generic language (Gelman,\nWare and Kleinberg 2010; Rhodes, Leslie and Tworek 2012; Leshin,\nLeslie and Rhodes 2021). (An interesting quandary emerges when we note\nthat quantified statements are often interpreted and recalled as\ngenerics: is there any way to speak of social groups at a general\nlevel without inducing essentialist beliefs?)\n\nAs another illustration of the impact generic language, and language\nabout identity categories more generally, can have on young children,\nRhodes and Leslie noted that science is often described to young\nchildren using identity-focused language, e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s be\nscientists! Scientist explore the world using their senses.\u201d\nHowever, action-focused language offers an alternative way to\ncommunciate much the same content, e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s do\nscience! Doing science means exploring the world with our\nsenses.\u201d In a series of experiments, Rhodes and Leslie and\ncollaborators have found that children who belong to social groups\nthat are underrepresented in science (girls, children from\nunderrepresented minorities or lower income backgrounds) show more\nengagement and persistence when they hear science described using\naction-focused language as opposed to identity-focused language (e.g.,\nRhodes, Cardarelli and Leslie 2020).\n\nIn addition to fostering essentialist beliefs, generics are also often\nused to communicate normative statements about social groups, e.g.,\n\u201cboys don\u2019t cry\u201d, \u201ca woman puts family before\ncareer\u201d, \u201cfriends don\u2019t let friends drive\ndrunk\u201d (see also section 3.2 above). Generics such as these are\nnot intended as descriptions of the facts on the ground, but rather\ncarry a particular normative force; \u201cfriends don\u2019t let\nfriends drive drunk\u201d was not introduced as a banal observation\nabout what is in fact the case, but rather was introduced precisely to\naddress the fact that, all too often, people were allowing their\nfriends to drive under the influence. In the context of gender, these\nnormative generics can serve as a concise (and child-friendly) means\nof communicating and sustaining problematic social norms. Moreover,\nrecent empirical work reflects that very young children may interpret\ngenerics as having prescriptive force, even if those generics seems to\nadults to be only descriptive generalizations (Roberts, Ho and Gelman\n2017).\n\nGeneric generalizations may be relevant to understanding social\nprejudice in other respects too. For example, \u201cticks carry Lyme\ndisease\u201d is accepted at low prevalence levels, perhaps because\ncarrying Lyme disease is a dangerous property, of the sort one would\nwish to avoid. What then are we to make of similar generics in the\nsocial realm, e.g., \u201cMuslims are terrorists\u201d? Clearly,\nthere is something deeply wrong with the latter that is not wrong with\nthe former. One possibility is that these \u201cdangerous\ngenerics\u201d involve the assumption that the members of the kind in\nquestion share a nature that ground the property in question (or at\nleast the corresponding disposition or propensity), and so\ngeneralizations such as \u201cMuslims are terrorists\u201d again\ninvolve false essentialist beliefs about social groups (Leslie\n2017).\n\nAs a final illustration of the significance of generics for the social\nworld, consider the phenomenon of stereotype threat (Steele and\nAronson 1995; Steele 2010). Stereotype threat occurs when members of a\nstigmatized social group perform worse than they otherwise would have,\nbecause their membership in that group was made salient to them. For\nexample, the performance of women and African-Americans on\nstandardized tests is lowered if they are reminded first of their\ngroup membership by, e.g., being asked to report their gender or race\nbefore the exam. Interestingly, stereotype threat on a totally novel\ntask can be induced by simply uttering a generic\u2014e.g., telling a\ngirl \u201cboys are really good at this game\u201d (Cimpian 2013;\nCimpian, Mu and Erickson 2012). Simply hearing an evaluative generic\nstatement about a gender group was enough to impair children\u2019s\nperformance.\n\nThese findings suggest that generic language has an undesirable\ninfluence on how we come to understand the social world around us.\nNevertheless, Ritchie (2019) defends the use of some social generics\n(e.g., \u201cBlacks face economic, legal, and social\ndiscrimination\u201d, \u201cWomen are expected to want\nchildren\u201d) on the grounds that they are uniquely apt for\ndescribing and ameliorating conditions of structural injustice.\n",
