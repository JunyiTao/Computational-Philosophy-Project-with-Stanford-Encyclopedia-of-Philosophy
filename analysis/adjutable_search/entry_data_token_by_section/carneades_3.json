    "main_text": "Ethics\n3. Ethics\n\nTackling ethics, Carneades proceeded as he had in epistemology and\nconstructed a framework intended to capture and do justice to the\nmotives behind ethical theory. His framework classified not only all\nthe views about the goal or end of life that had been held, but also\nall those that could be held (Cicero, Fin. 5.16\u201321 =\nL&S 64EG; cf. Algra, 1997). He sets out from the assumption that\npractical wisdom, the knowledge we need to conduct our lives\nsuccessfully, must have an object. That is, it must be knowledge of\nsomething other than itself. This immediately rules out of contention\nviews that identify human good with knowledge without having anything\nto say about what it might be knowledge of apart from human good (the\nthreat of circularity had already been noted by Plato,\nRepublic 505bc). He further supposes that this object must be\none towards which human beings have a natural impulse. There were, he\nmaintained, three possible such objects: pleasure, freedom from pain,\nand the natural advantages such as health and strength. The principle\nof virtue corresponds to this initial choice: to be virtuous is to act\nwith a view to obtaining one of them. There are six simple views about\nthe goal of life, three of which identify the goal with virtue, that\nis, acting with a view to obtaining either pleasure, freedom from\npain, or the natural advantages; and three of which identify it with\nactually obtaining one of these objects. Three combined views take the\ngoal to be a combination of virtue and actually obtaining the\ncorresponding object. There are thus nine views altogether. The Stoic\nposition, that virtue is the only good, is the third view mentioned,\nnamely that the goal is acting with a view to obtaining the natural\nadvantages whether or not one obtains them.\n\nOn different occasions, we are informed, Carneades defended the simple\nview that the goal is actually to obtain the natural advantages or the\ncombined view that it is virtue together with pleasure (Fin.\n2.35; 5.20; Acad. 2.132, 139). His aim seems to have been to\nchallenge the Stoics by showing that the considerations captured by\nthe framework do not all point to the Stoic view. By defending the\nview that the goal is the actual enjoyment of the natural advantages,\nCarneades probably intended to suggest that the considerations which\nsupport taking the natural advantages as the object of our first\nnatural impulse, as the Stoics did, also count in favor of taking them\nto be goods and therefore components of the end. The point of arguing\nin support of the view that the goal is a combination of virtue and\npleasure, on the other hand, was probably to show that taking pleasure\nas the ultimate object of impulse would require a recognizably\nvirtuous life, a view for which there were Socratic antecedents in\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras. Neither of these positions had the\nkind of independent appeal that Carneades\u2019 probabilism and his\nviews about assent did\u2014our sources always describe them as put\nforward for the sake of argument\u2014but Carneades\u2019 division\nof ethical views was extremely influential, and through Cicero it\nshaped the modern understanding of Hellenistic ethical theory (cf.\nStriker, 1991 sect. 5; Allen, 2014).\n\nCarneades also raised problems for the Stoic attempts to define of the\nend of life in terms drawn from the arts or technai (cf.\nStriker, 1991 sect. 3).\n",
