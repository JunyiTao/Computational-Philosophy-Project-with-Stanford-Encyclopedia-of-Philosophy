    "main_text": "Beneficence in Business Ethics || Corporate Beneficence\n7.1 Corporate Beneficence\n\n\nSeveral problems in business ethics are attempts to come to grips\nwith Smith\u2019s view. Discussions of the role of the corporation in\nsociety and the very purpose of a corporation as a social institution\nare examples. It is not disputed that the purpose of a for-profit\ncorporation is to make a profit for stockholders, but there is an\nintense debate about whether maximizing stockholder profits is the\nsole legitimate purpose of corporations\u2014as Milton\nFriedman and others have argued\u2014and whether truly beneficent\ncorporate conduct is justifiable. This question is normative, but Smith\nalso raises questions of moral psychology: Is it reasonable to expect\nbenevolent acts from members of the business community? Does\nbeneficence have any place in the world of business as we know it?\n\n\nCorporate social programs often appear to involve a mixture of\nlimited beneficence and self-interested goals such as developing and\nsustaining relationships with customers. An example is found in public\nutilities\u2019 programs to help customers pay for electricity, gas, oil,\nphone service, and the like. These programs sometimes decrease rather\nthan increase corporate profits. They are, in effect, a form of\ncorporate philanthropy. The programs locate and attempt to remedy the\nroot causes of bill nonpayment, which typically involve financial\ndistress. The programs also seek to rescue people in the community who\nare in unfortunate circumstances because of industrial injury, the ill\nhealth of a spouse or child, drug dependency, and the like. The company\nmay even pay for consumer advocates, who are social workers trained to\ndeal with customers and their problems. These programs, by design, make\nlife better for various members of the community who have suffered\nmisfortune. They may not be entirely motivated by benevolence, however,\nbecause they may be heavily designed to achieve a positive public image\nas well as to receive payment for overdue bills.\n\n\nSome firms have charitable programs that seem to be cases of pure\nbeneficence\u2014that is, not ones admixed with forms of outreach that\nwill help the company. Money is taken directly out of profits, with no\nexpected return of benefits. It has been questioned, however, whether\nprograms of even this description are instances of pure benevolence. In\nthe precedent U. S. case of A. P. Smith Manufacturing v.\nBarlow (1953), a judge determined that a beneficent charitable\ndonation to Princeton University by the A. P. Smith Co. was a\nlegitimate act of beneficence by responsible corporate officers.\nHowever, the judge acknowledged that such beneficence may not be pure\nbeneficence, but rather an act taken in the interest of the corporation\nby building its public image and esteem. In effect, the judge suggests\nthat such a gift, while beneficent, may not derive from entirely\nbenevolent motives. If beneficent acts by corporations are nothing more\nthan clever ways to maximize profits, then these actions seem to\nsatisfy Friedman\u2019s conception.\n\n\nWhatever the truth about businesses\u2019 motives, a separate question is\nwhether businesses have obligations of beneficent action. Stakeholder\ntheory answers in the affirmative. In the classical\nprofit-to-stockholder view, stockholders\u2019 interests were supreme, but\nthis view often lost sight of the interests of other stakeholders,\nparticularly those whose efforts are necessary for a firm\u2019s survival\nand flourishing. Who deserves to benefit from corporate income? A\nstakeholder is any individual or group that can affect or benefit, or\nbe affected by or benefited by, a business organization. Stakeholders\nwho can be affected by corporate activities include customers,\nemployees, suppliers, owners, local communities, subcontractors,\nconsultants, and stockholders. Stakeholder theory is commonly regarded\nas a theory of corporate responsibility\u2014the theory that managers\nof a firm have obligations to a specified group of stakeholders. Many\nof these obligations are ones of beneficence, especially with regard to\nemployees and other stockholders. Benefit packages for employees\nprovide a standard example. Stockholder theory, by contrast, is the\ntheory that managers have obligations\u2014conceived as fiduciary\nduties\u2014only to stockholder interests. In contemporary business\nethics it is commonly held that corporate responsibility requires some\nform of stakeholder inclusion, but this perspective has not been\ndeveloped in adequate detail as a theory of corporate obligations of\nbeneficence, because there may be additional obligations of beneficence\nto contribute to social awareness and public policy even if the\naffected community is not truly a stakeholder.\n\n\nDo corporations have obligations of beneficence to some larger\ncommunity? Many corporations have answered yes to this question. In a\nstatement of \u201cThe Johnson and Johnson Way,\u201d the Johnson and\nJohnson Company credo, it is said that Johnson and Johnson is\nresponsible to the communities in which it thrives, and indeed to the\nworld community. The company asserts an obligation to be good citizens,\nincluding offering the support of charities, the encouragement of civic\nprogress, the bettering of public health, and the improvement of\neducation. Johnson and Johnson and other companies assert that they\nhave obligations to these ends, but to many writers in business ethics\nthis claim of obligations is either misguided or overstated. They\nregard such moral demands as broad moral ideals or institutional\ncommitments, especially if they reach out to the world community.\n",
