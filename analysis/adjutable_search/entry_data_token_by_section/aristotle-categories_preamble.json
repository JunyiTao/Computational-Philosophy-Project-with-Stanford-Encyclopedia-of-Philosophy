    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s Categories is a singularly important work\nof philosophy. It not only presents the backbone of Aristotle\u2019s\nown philosophical theorizing but has exerted an unparalleled influence\non the systems of many of the greatest philosophers in the western\ntradition. The set of doctrines in the Categories, which I\nwill henceforth call categorialism, provides the framework of\ninquiry for a wide variety of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical\ninvestigations, ranging from his discussions of time and change in the\nPhysics to the science of being qua being in the\nMetaphysics, and even extending to his rejection of Platonic\nethics in the Nicomachean Ethics. Looking beyond his own\nworks, Aristotle\u2019s categorialism has engaged the attention of\nsuch diverse philosophers as Plotinus, Porphyry, Aquinas, Descartes,\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Brentano, and\nHeidegger (to mention just a few), who have variously embraced,\ndefended, modified or rejected its central contentions. All, in their\ndifferent ways, have thought it necessary to come to terms with\nfeatures of Aristotle\u2019s categorial scheme.\n\nPlainly, the enterprise of categorialism inaugurated by Aristotle runs\ndeep in the philosophical psyche. Even so, despite its wide-reaching\ninfluence \u2014 and, indeed owing to that influence \u2014 any\nattempt to describe categorialism faces a significant difficulty:\nexperts disagree on many of its most important and fundamental\naspects. Each of the following questions has received markedly\ndifferent answers from highly respected scholars and philosophers.\nWhat do the categories classify? What theory of predication underlies\nAristotle\u2019s scheme? What is the relationship between\ncategorialism and hylemorphism, Aristotle\u2019s other major\nontological theory? Where does matter fit, if at all, in the\ncategorial scheme? When did Aristotle write the Categories?\nDid Aristotle write the Categories? Is the list of\nkinds in the Categories Aristotle\u2019s considered list, or\ndoes he modify his views elsewhere? Is Aristotle\u2019s view of\nsubstance in the Categories consistent with his view of\nsubstance in the Metaphysics? Is there some method that\nAristotle used in order to generate his list of categories? Is\nAristotle\u2019s categorialism philosophically defensible in whole or\nin part? If only in part, which part of categorialism is\nphilosophically defensible?\n\nGiven the divergence of expert opinion about even the most basic\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s Categories, it is inevitable\nthat an attempt to give a neutral account of the basic positions it\ncontains will be seen as wrong-headed, perhaps drastically so, by some\nscholars or other. One could attempt to address this problem by\ncommenting on every scholarly debate and opinion, but such a project\nwould fail to bring to life the most striking features of Aristotelian\ncategorialism. In what follows, therefore, I shall take a different\nroute. I first present a natural, though perhaps overly simplified,\ninterpretation of the main structures in Aristotle\u2019s categorial\nscheme, while pausing en route to note some especially\ncontroversial points. I then go on to discuss one important scholarly\nand philosophical debate about the categories, namely the question of\nwhether there is some systematic procedure by which Aristotle\ngenerated his famous list. The debate is of interest in large part\nbecause it concerns one of the most fundamental metaphysical topics:\nwhat is the correct system of categories? I am not ultimately\nconcerned to present the correct interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s Categories. Rather, I only hope to provide\na useful introduction to the content of this endlessly fascinating\nwork.\n",
