    "main_text": "Moral motivation 1: reward and punishment || Locke\u2019s general theory of motivation\n3.1 Locke\u2019s general theory of motivation\n\nLocke develops his hedonistic account most extensively in the\nEssay. According to this account, pleasure and pain are the\nprimary motivating factors for all human action and human thought.\nFeelings of pleasure and pain accompany all our ideas, for Locke,\nprompting us to act in response to our perceptual experiences, and to\nmove, in thought, from one idea to another. If we had no accompanying\nfeeling of delight or pain in the face of certain stimuli we would be\nunmoved to create music, eat when hungry, or even shift our attention\nfrom one idea to any other\u2014the perception of rain would raise in\nus no different response than a sunny day, the idea of one\u2019s children\nwould inspire no related thoughts of home or family, nor any\ndiscernibly different response from the idea of children one does not\nknow. Locke writes,\n\nwe should have no reason to preferr [sic] one Thought or Action, to\nanother; Negligence, to Attention; or Motion, to Rest. And so we\nshould neither stir our Bodies, nor employ our Minds; but let our\nthoughts (if I may so call it) run a drift, without any direction or\ndesign; and suffer the Ideas of our Minds, like unregarded\nshadows to make their appearances there, as it happen\u2019d, without\nattending to them. (Essay, 2.7.3)\n\n\nPleasure and pain are the engines that make decisions, thoughts, and\nactions happen. This is not merely coincidence, or chance, for Locke,\nbut yet another example of God\u2019s divine design. God has attached\nfeelings of pleasure and pain to our ideas, so the natural faculties\nwith which humans are endowed \u201cmight not remain wholly idle, and\nunemploy\u2019d by us\u201d (Essay, 2.7.3).\n",
