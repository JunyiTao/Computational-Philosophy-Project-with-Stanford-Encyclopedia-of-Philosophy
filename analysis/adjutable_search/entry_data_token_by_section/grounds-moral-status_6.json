Degrees of Moral Status\n\nThose who accept that moral status comes in degrees have not developed\nfine-grained accounts of what each degree of status would involve.\nTheir emphasis has been on the difference in status between creatures\nor entities that have some moral status (dogs, rabbits, etc.), and\nthose who deserve the highest degree of moral status (FMS). However,\nwith the above account of FMS made explicit, one can delineate\ndifferent paradigms for capturing degrees of moral status, which we\nwill list here simply in the spirit of marking out possible positions,\nand thus without addressing the pros, cons, and implications of each\nposition.\n\nOne way to capture degrees of moral status is to vary the strength of\nthe reasons outlined in section 2 (and hence also the degree of\nwrongness involved in acting against these reasons \u2013 see\nDeGrazia 2008). For example, while there is a very stringent moral\npresumption against killing an unimpaired adult human being, there\nmight be only strong but non-stringent reasons not to kill a dog, and\nvery weak reasons not to kill a fish. The weaker the reason not to\nkill is, the broader the set of circumstances are that can override\nthis reason. In addition, it will silence fewer, if any, conflicting\nconsiderations. The other categories of reasons would be handled\nsimilarly: when the benefit to be received, the cost of providing that\nbenefit, and other similar factors are on a par, there is a strong\nreason to aid an unimpaired adult human being, but only some reason to\naid a dog, and very little reason to aid a fish, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, one could treat FMS as involving a stringent reason not\nto be killed of the type that, in cases of conflict, would override\nwhat maximizes the overall good, whereas, for a being with lesser\nmoral status, what maximizes the overall good \u2013 with this\nbeing\u2019s good included in the calculus \u2013 does settle how\nthis being should be treated (McMahan 2002, pp. 245\u2013247).\n\nAnother way to capture degrees of moral status is to vary not the\nstrength of the reasons but which reasons apply. Instead of the three\ncategories of reasons discussed above, lesser moral status might\ninvolve two kinds of reasons (a stringent moral presumption against\ninterference and a strong reason to aid, but no reason to treat\nfairly) or only one (a stringent moral presumption against\ninterference, but no reason to aid or treat fairly). This, of course,\nis compatible with other reasons, in a given context, to aid or treat\nfairly that do not derive from the being\u2019s moral status (see\nsection 2.4).\n\nAlternatively, lesser moral status might involve fewer presumptions\nagainst different types of interference. For example, there might be\nonly a presumption against causing a chicken pain but not a\npresumption against killing it.\n\nOf course, one could combine these approaches. For example, to have\nthe highest degree of moral status is for there to be very strong\nreasons of all three types, an intermediate level of moral status\n(e.g., the status of a dog) might involve some reason not to kill the\nbeing but no reason to aid it or treat it fairly, while the lowest\ndegree of moral status would involve a very weak reason of just one\ntype. Although having the lowest degree of moral status would not\nafford much protection, it nevertheless is different from having no\nmoral status at all. A fingernail has no moral status and so no\nreasons of any kind need be given for cutting it up and discarding it.\nBut sufficient justification must be provided for doing this to a\nbeing with even very low moral status.\n",
