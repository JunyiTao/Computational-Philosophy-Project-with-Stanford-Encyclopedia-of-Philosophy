    "main_text": "Decision theory\n6. Decision theory\n\nDecision theory is concerned with determining the best way to achieve\nas valuable an outcome as possible, given the values that we have. In\ndecision theory, our values and goals are taken as given, and the\nanalysis concerns how best to achieve them to an as high degree as\npossible. Decision-making under risk and uncertainty is one of the\nmajor topics in decision theory. It is usually assumed that if the\nvalues of a set of potential outcomes are known (for instance from\nmoral philosophy), then purely instrumental considerations are\nsufficient for determining how best to act under risk or uncertainty\nin order to achieve the best possible result. (For a critical\ndiscussion of that presumption, see Hansson 2013, 49\u201351.) The\nvalues taken for given in decision-theoretical analysis can, but need\nnot, be moral values of the types that are developed and analyzed in\nmoral philosophy.\n",
