    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nThe consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics was\nintroduced by Griffiths (1984), and\ndiscussed by Omn\u00e8s in a series of papers beginning\nwith (Omn\u00e8s 1988). The decoherent\nhistories approach that first appeared\nin Gell-Mann & Hartle (1990)\ncontains similar ideas. The single term \u201chistories\u201d will\nbe employed below, with the understanding that at points where the\n\u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cdecoherent\u201d approaches might\nbe slightly different, the former is intended.\nThe histories approach extends the calculational methods found in\nstandard textbooks and gives them a microscopic physical\ninterpretation which the textbooks lack. It is not intended as an\nalternative, but as a fully consistent and clear statement of basic\nquantum mechanics, \u201cCopenhagen done right\u201d. In particular,\nmeasurements are treated in the same way as all other physical\nprocesses and play no special role in the interpretation. Thus there\nis no measurement problem, and under appropriate conditions one can\ndiscuss the microscopic properties revealed by measurements.\nAll the standard quantum paradoxes (double slit, Schr\u00f6dinger cat,\nHardy, three box, etc.) are resolved using the histories approach, or\none might better say \u201ctamed\u201d: they are no longer unsolved\ndifficulties casting doubt upon the reliability and completeness of\nthe quantum formalism, but instead they illustrate striking\ndifferences between quantum and classical physics. In particular,\nthere is no conflict between quantum theory and relativity:\nsuperluminal influences cannot carry information or anything else for\nthe simple reason that they do not exist. In appropriate regimes\n(large systems, strong decoherence) the laws of classical physics\nprovide a very good approximation, valid for all practical purposes,\nto the more fundamental and more exact laws of quantum mechanics.\nBut at what price? The histories approach introduces a variety of\nconcepts that go beyond textbook quantum theory, and these can be\nsummarized under two headings. First, quantum dynamics is treated as\nstochastic or probabilistic. Not just when measurements are carried\nout, but always. Born\u2019s rule, together with its extensions,\nis a fundamental axiom of quantum theory. The task of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\ntime-dependent equation is to assist in assigning\nprobabilities. Second, following Sec. III.5\nof J. von Neumann (1932), quantum\nproperties, which are what the probabilities refer to, are associated\nwith subspaces of the quantum Hilbert space. But then new logical\nprinciples are required to consistently deal with the difference\nbetween the quantum Hilbert space and a classical phase space. These\nprinciples are related to, but not identical with, those of the\nquantum logic initiated by Birkhoff &\nNeumann (1936).\nSince textbook quantum mechanics already contains certain rules for\ncalculating probabilities, the first innovation of the histories\napproach, stochastic dynamics, is not very startling and by itself\ncauses few conceptual difficulties. It is the second innovation, in\nthe domain of logic and ontology, that represents the most radical\ndeparture from classical thinking. However, the new quantum logic\nreduces to the old familiar classical propositional logic in the same\ndomain where classical mechanics is a good approximation to quantum\nmechanics. That is to say, the old logic is perfectly good for all\npractical purposes in the same domain where classical mechanics is\nperfectly good for all practical purposes, and a consistent, fully\nquantum analysis explains why this is so.\n",
