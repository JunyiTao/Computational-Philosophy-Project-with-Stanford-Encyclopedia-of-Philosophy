    "main_text": "The Ecology/Ecosystem Services Framings || Further exploration of biodiversity insurance value\n4.1 Further exploration of biodiversity insurance value\n\nThe insurance and options benefits from living variation recognised in\nthe pre-history, also appear in later work, using the new term\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d (e.g., Bartkowski 2017). Post 1985, such\ndiscussions continued to follow the pre-history in considering the\nvalue of variety itself for insurance. However, alternative\nperspectives focussed more on the early discussions pointing to a\nbroader ecological/ecosystem interpretation of insurance and related\nideas such as \u201cecological integrity\u201d.\n\nIUCN (1980) described \u201cecological integrity\u201d as:\n\n\nMaintaining the diversity and quality of ecosystems and enhancing\ntheir capacity to adapt to change and provide for the needs of future\ngenerations.\n\n\nSometimes this more ecological rationale has been discussed as part of\na new \u201cbiodiversity\u201d framing, so setting the stage for\necological definitions of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d.\n\nFor example, Ehrlich and Wilson (1991) listed three basic reasons why\nwe should care about biodiversity. The first was most closely linked\nto intrinsic value: a \u201cmoral responsibility to protect what are\nour only known living companions in the universe\u201d. Their second\nreason reflected the option value of biodiversity\u2014the idea\nthat\n\n\nhumanity has already obtained foods, medicines, and industrial\nproducts and other benefits from biodiversity, and has the potential\nfor many more.\n\n\nTheir third reason was an insurance type argument, based on the\nrecognised ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems. Here,\nthey made a link to biodiversity in arguing that \u201cdiverse\nspecies are the key working parts\u201d within such ecosystems.\n\n\u201cWorking parts\u201d could mean variety, or it could refer to\nthe ecology of lots of parts in an ecosystem. In earlier work (Ehrlich\n& Ehrlich 1981) \u201cinsurance\u201d was linked to the loss of\nbiological diversity and so linked to variety. Ehrlich and\nEhrlich\u2019s (1992: 219) later arguments for biodiversity\nconservation referred both to option value (from variety expressed as\nnature\u2019s \u201cgenetic library\u201d), and to insurance\nvalue\u2014expressed less as variety and more as a consideration of\necological aspects. Thus, \u201cinsurance\u201d sometimes joins\n\u201cecological integrity\u201d, and similar terms as part of a\nstoryline about many relevant aspects of ecosystems.\n\nSimilarly, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) described the\nmultiple values of biodiversity in a way that reinforced the duality\nof insurance and option values from variety, but also linked\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d to ecological aspects, including resilience\nand integrity.\n",
