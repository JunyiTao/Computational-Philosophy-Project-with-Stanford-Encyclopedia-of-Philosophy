    "main_text": "Evaluation of Legal Rules and Institutions || The Argument for Welfarism Revisited\n6.3 The Argument for Welfarism Revisited\n\nThe discussion in the previous section has not decisively demonstrated\nthat we should reject welfarism as the sole evaluative criterion for\nlegal rules and institutions. We have argued only that arguments that\nrest on the intuitive appeal of the Pareto criterion are insufficient\nto establish the welfarist claim. The Pareto criterion has great\nintuitive appeal but it also has strong implications that bring it\ninto conflict with other principles that also have strong intuitive\nappeal. \n\nLegal rules and institutions offer a comprehensive guide to and\nregulation of social life. The intuitive appeal of various principles\nmay vary with the range of activity governed by the legal rule or\ninstitution. The intuitive appeal of the Pareto criterion is strongest\nin those areas of law that regulate corporate and commercial behavior.\nPerhaps here, indeed, welfarist considerations should provide the sole\nguide to the structure of legal rules and institutions. Election law\nand laws regulating political speech, by contrast, may be legal\ndomains in which the appeal of principles of communal self-governance\ndominate. In these areas, evaluation based exclusively on welfarist\nconsiderations seems less appropriate. \n\nControversies in many areas of law, however, implicate many of our\nvalues. Environmental regulation, for example, clearly implicates\nwelfarist concerns. Regulation determines in part the relative costs\nof production of various goods and services that contribute to\nindividual well-being. Environmental regulation, however, also clearly\nimplicates questions of autonomy. Productive activities may impose\nunwanted risks on individuals that limit the exercise of the\nindividual\u2019s autonomy. Tort law perhaps raises these issues more\nstarkly. \n\nSimilarly, we may understand conflicts over the appropriate tax and\nsocial welfare policy as raising questions not only of efficiency but\nalso of autonomy as responsibility. Exclusive focus on welfarist\nconcerns distorts these policy debates by ignoring fundamental issues\nthat divide us.\n",
