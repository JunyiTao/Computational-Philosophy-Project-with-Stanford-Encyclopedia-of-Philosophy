    "main_text": "Power as Domination || Intersectional Approaches\n3.4 Intersectional Approaches\n\nTheories of intersectionality highlight the complex, interconnected,\nand cross-cutting relationships between diverse modes of domination,\nincluding (but not limited to) sexism, racism, class oppression, and\nheterosexism. The project of intersectional feminism grew out of Black\nfeminism, which, as scholars have recently noted, has a long tradition\nof examining the interconnections between racism and sexism,\nstretching back to the writing and activism of late 19th and early\n20th century black feminists such as Maria W. Stewart, Ida. B. Wells,\nAnna Julia Cooper, and Sojourner Truth (see Gines 2014b and Cooper\n2016). Because these thinkers and activists did not use the term\nintersectionality, Gines (now Belle) characterizes their work as\nproto-intersectional, which she defines as follows: \u201cidentifying\nand combating racism and sexism \u2013 through activist organizing and\ncampaigning \u2013 not only as separate categories impacting identity and\noppression, but also as systems of oppression that work together and\nmutually reinforce one another, presenting unique problems for black\nwomen who experience both, simultaneously and differently than white\nwomen and/or black men\u201d (Gines 2014b, 14). Other important\nantecedents to contemporary intersectionality theory include the\nCombahee River Collective\u2019s notion of \u201cinterlocking\nsystems of oppression\u201d (CRC 1977), Deborah King\u2019s analysis\nof multiple jeopardy and multiple consciousness (King 1988), and the\nwork from the 1980s of Black feminists such as Audre Lorde (1984),\nAngela Davis (1984), and bell hooks (1981). As Mariana Ortega has\nargued (2016), there are also important conceptions of\nintersectionality developed in Latina feminism, particularly in\nAnzald\u00faa's account of the borderlands and mestiza consciusness\n(Anzald\u00faa 1987) and Lugones's account of the intermeshedness of\nrace, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and class (Lugones 2003).\n\nIn other words, the concept of intersectionality has a long history\nand a complex genealogy (for discussions, see Cooper 2016, Collins\n2011 and 2019, 123\u2013126, and Nash 2019). Still, it is widely\nacknowledged that the contemporary discussion and use of the term\nintersectionality was sparked by the work of legal theorist Kimberle\nCrenshaw (Crenshaw 1991a and 1991b), specifically, by her critique of\nsingle-axis frameworks for understanding domination in the context of\nlegal discrimination. A single-axis framework treats race and gender\nas mutually exclusive categories of experience. In so doing, such a\nframework implicitly privileges the perspective of the most privileged\nmembers of oppressed groups \u2013 sex or class-privileged Blacks in\nrace discrimination cases; race or class-privileged women in sex\ndiscrimination cases. Thus, a single-axis framework distorts the\nexperiences of Black women, who are simultaneously subject to multiple\nand intersecting forms of subordination. As Crenshaw explains,\n\u201cthe intersection of racism and sexism factors into Black\nwomen\u2019s lives in ways that cannot be captured wholly by looking\nat the race or gender dimensions of those experiences\nseparately\u201d (Crenshaw 1991b, 1244).\n\nIn the thirty years since the publication of Crenshaw\u2019s essays\non intersectionality, this framework has become extraordinarily\ninfluential in women\u2019s, gender, and sexuality studies. Indeed,\nit has been called \u201cthe most important contribution that\nwomen\u2019s studies, in conjunction with other fields, has made so\nfar\u201d (McCall 2005, 1771). However, feminist philosophers have\nnoted that this influence has yet to be felt within the mainstream of\nthe discipline of philosophy, where \u201cintersectionality is\nlargely ignored as a philosophical theme or framework\u201d (Goswami,\nO\u2019Donovan and Yount 2014, 6). Moreover, intersectionality is not\nwithout its feminist critics.\n\nSome sympathetic critics of intersectionality have suggested that the\nconcept is limited in that it focuses primarily on the\naction-theoretical level. A full analysis of the intertwining of\nracial, gender, and class-based subordination also requires, on this\nview, a systemic or macro-level concept that corresponds to the\nconcept of intersectionality. Echoing the Combahee River Collective\n(CRC 1977), Patricia Hill Collins proposes the term\n\u201cinterlocking systems of oppression\u201d to fulfill this role.\nAs she explains, \u201cthe notion of interlocking oppressions refers\nto the macro-level connections linking systems of oppression such as\nrace, class, and gender. This is the model describing the social\nstructures that create social positions. Second, the notion of\nintersectionality describes micro-level processes \u2013 namely, how\neach individual and group occupies a social position within\ninterlocking structures of oppression described by the metaphor of\nintersectionality. Together they shape oppression\u201d (Collins\net al. 2002, 82).\n\nOthers have worried that discussions of intersectionality tend to\nfocus too much on relations and sites of oppression and subordination,\nwithout also taking into account relations of privilege and dominance.\nAs Jennifer Nash has argued, this has led to \u201cthe question of\nwhether all identities are intersectional or whether only\nmultiply marginalized subjects have an intersectional identity\u201d\n(Nash 2008, 9). Although some feminist scholars claim that\nintersectionality encompasses all subject positions, not just those\nthat are marginalized or oppressed, Nash notes that \u201cthe\noverwhelming majority of intersectional scholarship has centred on the\nparticular positions of multiply marginalized subjects\u201d (Nash\n2008, 9\u201310). The over-emphasis on oppression in theories of\nintersectionality leads theorists \u201cto ignore the intimate\nconnections between privilege and oppression,\u201d for example, by\n\u201cignor[ing] the ways in which subjects might be both victimized\nby patriarchy and privileged by race\u201d (Nash 2008, 12). In\nresponse to this concern, philosophers such as Ann Garry have offered\na broader, more inclusive conception of intersectionality that\nemphasizes both oppression and privilege (see Garry 2011).\n\nRather than supplementing the notion of intersectionality with a\nmacro-level concept of interlocking systems of oppression or\nbroadening it to include relations of oppression and privilege, Naomi\nZack argues that feminists should move beyond it. Zack maintains that\nintersectionality undermines its own goal of making feminism more\ninclusive. It does this, on Zack\u2019s view, by dividing women into\nsmaller and smaller groups, formed by specific intersections of race,\nclass, gender, sexuality, and so forth. As Zack puts it, \u201cas a\ntheory of women\u2019s identity, intersectionality is not inclusive\ninsofar as members of specific intersections of race and class create\nonly their own feminisms\u201d (Zack 2005, 2). Because it\ntends toward \u201cthe reification of intersections as\nincommensurable identities,\u201d Zack maintains that\n\u201cintersectionality has not borne impressive political\nfruit\u201d (Zack 2005, 18).\n\nFrom a very different perspective, queer theorists such as Lynne\nHuffer and Jasbir Puar have also criticized intersectionality as a\ntheory of identity. Unlike Zack, however, their concern is not with\nthe proliferation of incommensurable identities but rather with the\nways in which the notion of intersectionality remains, as Puar says,\n\u201cprimarily trapped within the logic of identity\u201d (Puar\n2012, 60). As Huffer puts the point: \u201cthe institutionalization\nof intersectionality as the only approach to gender and\nsexuality that takes difference seriously masks\nintersectionality\u2019s investment in a subject-making form of\npower-knowledge that runs the risk of perpetuating precisely the\nproblems intersectionality had hoped to alleviate\u201d (Huffer 2013,\n18). Puar argues further that the primary concepts of\nintersectionality, including gender, race, class, and sexuality, are\nthemselves the product of Eurocentric, modernist, and colonial\ndiscourses and practices and, as such, are problematic from the point\nof view of postcolonial and transnational feminism (Puar 2012).\n\nFinally, Anna Carastathis has argued that the problem with\nintersectionality theory lies in its very success (Carastathis 2013\nand 2014). Intersectionality has been, on her view, too easily\nappropriated by white-dominated feminist theory, cut off from its\nroots in Black and women of color feminism, and incorporated into a\nself-congratulatory progressivist narrative according to which\n\u201cintersectionality is celebrated as a methodological triumph\nover \u2018previous\u2019 essentialist and exclusionary approaches\nto theorizing identity and power relations\u201d (Carastathis 2014,\n59; for related critiques, see Nash 2008 and 2019 and Puar 2012).\nCarastathis cites Kimberle Crenshaw\u2019s lament that\nintersectionality\u2019s reach is wide but not very deep, and\nsuggests that this may be the result of aversive racism \u2013 that\nis, a desire to assert or establish racial innocence, but without\nreally coming to terms with their own internalized racism \u2013 on\nthe part of white feminists (Carastathis, 2014, 68\u201369).\n\nIn response to these sorts of criticisms of intersectionality, some\nscholars have attempted to reformulate the concept by understanding it\nas a family resemblance concept (Garry 2011) or by highlighting its\nprovisionality (Carastathis, 2014). Others have argued for an\nexpansion of the intersectional framework to better account for the\nexperiences of diasporic subjects (Sheth 2014) or for a rethinking of\nthis framework in relation to a Deleuzian notion of assemblage (Puar\n2007 and 2012). Collins (2019) has proposed the development of\nintersectionality as a critical social theory through a reflection on\nits genealogy, epistemology, and methodology.\n",
