    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is space? What is time? Do they exist independently of the things\nand processes in them? Or is their existence parasitic on those things\nand processes? Are they like a canvas onto which an artist paints;\nthey exist whether or not the artist paints on them? Or are they akin\nto parenthood; there is no parenthood until there are parents and\nchildren? That is, is there no space and time until there are things\nwith spatial properties and processes with temporal durations?\n\nThese questions have long been debated and continue to be debated. The\nhole argument arose when these questions were asked in the context of\nmodern spacetime physics, and in particular in the context of\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. In that context, space\nand time are fused into a single entity, spacetime, and we inquire\ninto its status. One view is that spacetime is a substance: a thing\nthat exists independently of the processes occurring within it. This\nis spacetime substantivalism. The hole argument seeks to show that\nthis viewpoint leads to unpalatable conclusions in a large class of\nspacetime theories. In particular, it seeks to show that spacetime\nsubstantivalism leads to a failure of determinism, meaning that a\ncomplete specification of the state of the universe at a given time,\nalongside the laws of nature of the theory under consideration (e.g.,\nthe laws of general relativity, which are Einstein\u2019s field\nequations), fails to determine uniquely how the universe will evolve\nto the future. It also presents a verificationist dilemma, for it\nappears to lead to the unexpected conclusion that there are facts\nabout the world which we can never know. Although these problems\nare neither logically contradictory nor refuted by experience, many\nwould nevertheless regard them as being unpalatable.\n\nThereby, the hole argument provides a template for the analysis of\nwhat are known as \u2019gauge redundancies\u2019 in physical\ntheories: i.e., the existence of surplus mathematical structure in\nsuch theories. We learn from it that the identification of surplus\nmathematical structure cannot be achieved by any a priori or purely\nmathematical rule. Some physical grounds are needed. In line with the\nabove, the hole argument provides two grounds that can be used: (i)\nverifiability\u2014changes in the candidate surplus structure make no\ndifference to what can be verified in observation; and (ii)\ndeterminism\u2014the laws of the theory are unable to fix the\ncandidate surplus structure.\n\nThe hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by\nAlbert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general\ntheory of relativity. It was revived and reformulated in the modern\ncontext by John3 = John Earman \\(\\times\\) John Stachel\n\\(\\times\\) John Norton.\n\nSee Stachel (2014) for a review that covers the historical aspects of\nthe hole argument and its significance in philosophy and physics. It\nis written at a technically more advanced level than this article. For\nanother recent review of the hole argument, see Pooley (2021).\n",
