    "main_text": "What is the Structure of the Real World?\n5. What is the Structure of the Real World?\n\nHartmann claims in Ontology: Laying the Foundations\n(1935) that the book \u201cform[s] the prelude to an ontology that I\nhave been working on for two decades,\u201d and that \u201c[a] new\ncritical ontology has become possible. The task is to make it a\nreality\u201d (v). The book paved the way for a systematic treatment\nof ontology by introducing (1) the difference between modes of being\n(the modalities of possibility, necessity and actuality), spheres of\nbeing (real and ideal), and ways of being (Dasein and\nSosein), as well as (2) a treatment of emotional transcendent\nacts as constituting the requisite pre-conceptual acquaintance with\nthe harshness of reality. The main thesis put forward by Hartmann in\nLaying the Foundations is that all ontological\ndifferences are categorial articulations of being, not differences\nbetween being and non-being. Parts and wholes are both authentic\naspects of being; independent and dependent entities are similarly\naspects of being; physical, biological, psychological and spiritual\ntypes of being are all manifestations of being, and none of them is\n\u201cmore being\u201d than any other. From the point of view of\nontology, no part, aspect, or moment of reality is \u201cmore\nbeing\u201d than any other part, aspect or moment of it. The fact\nthat, say, the existence of biological entities depends on that of\nphysical entities does not imply that physics is \u201cmore\nontologically real\u201d than biology. Existentially dependent\nentities are as ontologically genuine as existentially independent\nones. This basic premise is one of the points of departure for his\nontological pluralism. All entities, whatever their type, demand the\nsame careful ontological scrutiny. Hartmann\u2019s analytic\ndevelopment of ontology begins with the theory of ontological\nmodalities elaborated in Possibility and Actuality. The main\npurpose of this book is to demonstrate that modalities ground the\ndifferences between the two principal spheres of being (real and\nideal) and the two secondary spheres of being (knowledge and logic).\nFinally, The Structure of the Real World and Philosophy\nof Nature present in detail the many fundamental and special\ncategories within the real sphere of being.\n\nGiven his unique reading of Kant, \u201ccategories\u201d become the\ncentral theme of Hartmann\u2019s ontology. Hartmann\u2019s theory of\ncategories entirely breaks with Kant\u2019s or Hegel\u2019s theories\nof categories by explicitly denying that categories are concepts.\nWhile we need concepts in order to refer to categories, concepts never\ncapture categories entirely, just as our \u201cimages\u201d of\nobjects never capture \u201cwhat exists\u201d entirely.\n\nCategories deal with what is universal and necessary (AIntro12).\nCategories articulate in particular the Sosein\n(\u201cbeing-such-and-such-a-way\u201d) of entities; they specify\nconfigurations, structures and contents, not forms of existence\n(AIntro7). Categories specify the fundamental determinations of being,\nand are \u201cprinciples\u201d of being. As fundamental\ndeterminations of being, categories form the interior of entities, so\nto speak. In this sense, categories are immanent to the world, and do\nnot form a second world (A16b). The categorial interior of entities\ncan be viewed in terms of a core-periphery organization: the most\nfundamental categories structure the innermost core of entities, while\nother categories, such as scientific ones, add progressively more\nsuperficial layers. Ontological categories are the most fundamental,\nand form the network of internal, dynamic determinants and\ndependencies which articulate the furniture and structure of the\nworld. Categories do not form a homogeneous continuum, but appear to\nbe organized in groups (AIntro15). Some categories belong to all the\nspheres of being (ideal and real), some to the entire real world,\nothers to a specific stratum of reality. The first group of\ncategories, \u201cmodal categories,\u201d is analyzed in detail in\nPossibility and Actuality; the second group,\n\u201cfundamental categories,\u201d is covered in The Structure\nof the Real World, while the third group, \u201cspecial\ncategories,\u201d is explored in the Philosophy of Nature\nand other works. Fundamental categories include (1) categories\norganized in pairs of opposites, such as principle-concretum,\nelement-complex, and form-matter; (2) strata categories, such\nas those that distinguish inanimate, living, psychological, and\nspiritual beings; and (3) the categories of intercategorial\nconnections, or the group of categorial laws, such as the\nlaws of coherence, stratification, and dependence among\ncategories.\n\nWe come to know ontological categories through the objects that we\ncome to know. However, our knowledge of ontological categories is even\nmore provisional than our knowledge of objects. The difference between\nknowing objects and knowing categories explains why ontological\ncategories are often confused with concepts. The problem is that\ncategories do not allow direct acquaintance as objects do. Concepts\nare names of ontological categories, which implies that concepts are\npartial, static, separate representations of items that in themselves\nare both essentially dynamic and inseparable from other ontological\ncategories. Like the knowledge of objects, the knowledge of\nontological categories also changes\u2014when ontology develops, our\nunderstanding of ontological categories develops as well, so that we\ngain a deeper and better grasp of their articulation and subtleties.\nSome categories have countless variations, others only a few minor\nones. The most general and schematic categories are those with the\nmost meager content, and they are therefore those that change least\n(A27b).\n\nThe two main aspects of categories are their generality and their\ncharacter of determination. This second feature is what makes them\nprinciples. Principles exhaust themselves in this determining role.\nThey only exist for something else; they are something only with\nrespect to the concretum that they determine and are\nin. Principles are nothing without their concretum,\nand the concretum cannot exist without its principles (A1a;\n6b; 16b; and elsewhere). The ontological aspect of the categories\nconsists in some kind of determination of their concreta.\nCategories as principles are independent from their concreta,\nbut not from other categories (A11c). Principles imply one another,\nand all the categories characterizing a stratum of reality work\ntogether (A15c). Categories are far from being the only principles of\nentities. There are also highly particular principles structuring\nspecific domains of being\u2014such as natural laws or psychological\nlaws\u2014which are concreta with respect to general\ncategories (A25f). There is a gradation of principles from the most\ngeneral categories to specific real cases. Empirical laws are\nconcreta with respect to general principles, and they are\nprinciples with respect to individual instances.\n",
