    "main_text": "Symmetry Principles || Permutation symmetry\n2.3 Permutation symmetry\n\nThe first non-spatiotemporal symmetry to be introduced into\nmicrophysics, and also the first symmetry to be treated with the\ntechniques of group theory in the context of quantum mechanics, was\npermutation symmetry (or invariance under the transformations\nof the permutation group). This symmetry, \u201cdiscovered\u201d by\nW. Heisenberg in 1926 in relation to the indistinguishability of the\n\u201cidentical\u201d electrons of an atomic\n system,[12]\n is the discrete symmetry (i.e. based upon groups with a\ndiscrete set of elements) at the core of the so-called quantum\nstatistics (the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics), governing\nthe statistical behaviour of ensembles of certain types of\nindistinguishable quantum particles (e.g. bosons and fermions). The\npermutation symmetry principle states that if such an ensemble is\ninvariant under a permutation of its constituent particles then one\ndoesn\u2019t count those permutations which merely exchange\nindistinguishable particles, that is the exchanged state is identified\nwith the original state (see French and Rickles, 2003, Section 1).\n\nPhilosophically, permutation symmetry has given rise to two main sorts\nof questions. On the one side, seen as a condition of physical\nindistinguishability of identical particles (i.e. particles of the\nsame kind in the same atomic system), it has motivated a rich debate\nabout the significance of the notions of identity, individuality, and\nindistinguishability in the quantum domain. Does it mean that the\nquantum particles are not individuals? Does the existence of entities\nwhich are physically indistinguishable although \u201cnumerically\ndistinct\u201d (the so-called problem of identical particles) imply\nthat the Leibniz\u2019s Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\nshould be regarded as violated in quantum physics? On the other side,\nwhat is the theoretical and empirical status of this symmetry\nprinciple? Should it be considered as an axiom of quantum mechanics or\nshould it be taken as justified empirically? It is currently taken to\nexplain the nature of fermionic and bosonic quantum statistics, but\nwhy do there appear to be only bosons and fermions in the world when\nthe permutation symmetry group allows the possibility of many more\ntypes? French and Rickles (2003) offer an overview of the above and\nrelated issues, and a new twist in the tale can be found in Saunders\n(2006). Saunders discusses permutation symmetry in classical physics,\nand argues for indistinguishable classical particles obeying classical\nstatistics. He argues that the differences between quantum and\nclassical statistics, for certain classes of particles, therefore\ncannot be accounted for solely in terms of indistinguishability. For\nfurther discussion and references see French and Krause (2006),\nLadyman and Bigaj (2010), Caulton and Butterfield (2012), and the\nrelated SEP entry\n identity and individuality in quantum theory.\n",
