    "main_text": "Arguments for Narrow Content || Causal Arguments\n3.1 Causal Arguments\n\nOne influential argument for narrow content (Fodor 1987; a recent\ndefense of this kind of argument, with relies to criticisms, is\nGaukroger, 2017) appeals to considerations involving causal\nexplanation. We might outline the argument like this. A first premise\nis that mental states causally explain behavior by virtue of the\ncontent they have. Although this has been denied by some, it certainly\nseems to be a central part of commonsense psychology. Our behavior\nseems to be a causal consequence of our beliefs and desires; moreover,\nthe content of those beliefs and desires seems to be centrally\ninvolved in the causation of behavior. We behave the way we do because\nof what we want and what we believe, and this seems to be just another\nway of saying that we behave as we do because of the contents of our\nbeliefs and desires. A second premise is that the causal powers of an\nentity, its capacity to produce effects, must be intrinsic features of\nthe entity. Thus twins, who share all their intrinsic properties, must\nshare their causal powers. This premise seems plausible for at least\ntwo reasons. First, causation is local. It seems that\nfeatures of the environment can affect an individual\u2019s actions\nonly by way of effects on the individual\u2019s intrinsic properties.\nSecond, causal powers should be evaluated across contexts. If an\nastronaut on the Moon can easily lift a one-hundred-kilogram weight\nand I, on Earth, cannot, this does not mean that the astronaut is\nstronger; the crucial issue is whether the astronaut can lift more\nthan I can in the same environments. This appears to show that my Twin\nEarth counterpart and I have the same causal powers even though I can\nobtain water by turning on the faucet and he cannot, since our\nparallel actions will achieve parallel results provided that our\nenvironments are the same. A third and final premise is that broad\ncontent does not characterize intrinsic features, at least not\nessentially; thus twins need not share broad contents. According to\nthe first premise, mental states must have a kind of content that\ncausally explains behavior. Taken together, the second and third\npremises show that broad content cannot fulfill this role. The\nconclusion of the argument, then, is that mental states must have\nnarrow contents, contents that are shared between twins.\n\nExternalists have attacked this argument at its second premise, the\npremise that causal powers must be intrinsic properties. Against the\nargument that causal powers must be intrinsic because causation is\nlocal, Burge (1986, 1989) has argued that local causation is\nentirely compatible with broad individuation. Against the\nargument that the cross-context test for sameness of causal powers\nshows that they are intrinsic, Burge (1989) suggests that causal\npowers are typically identified relative to a normal environment;\nthus, for example, it would be reasonable to distinguish between a\nheart and a similar organ whose function is to pump waste even if one\nof these organs could be successfully surgically replaced by the\nother. Burge (1986) also argues that actual psychological theories,\nsuch as Marr\u2019s theory of vision, do not satisfy internalist\nconstraints. (For criticisms of Burge\u2019s interpretation of Marr,\nsee Segal 1989 and Egan 1991. Burge 2010 is a book-length defense of\nthe claim that perceptual psychology is anti-individualistic.)\n\nIn a later essay (Fodor 1991), Fodor defends a weaker and more\ncomplicated version of the second premise. He suggests that there are\nsome extrinsic properties, such as being a planet, that\naffect causal powers, and others, like being part of a universe in\nwhich a certain coin toss comes out heads, that are irrelevant to\ncausal powers. He then offers a criterion for distinguishing between\ncausally relevant extrinsic properties and causally irrelevant\nextrinsic properties: roughly, an extrinsic property is causally\nirrelevant to outcomes that it is logically connected to. He then\nargues that broad content does not satisfy the criterion for being a\ncausally relevant extrinsic property. (It should be noted that in\nstill more recent work (Fodor 1995, Chapter 2), Fodor has abandoned\nthe idea that narrow content is important for psychology.)\n",
