    "main_text": "\n\n\nBoolean algebra is the algebra of two-valued logic with only\nsentential connectives, or equivalently of algebras of sets under\nunion and complementation. The rigorous concept is that of a certain\nkind of algebra, analogous to the mathematical notion of a\ngroup. This concept has roots and applications in logic\n(Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras and model theory), set theory (fields of\nsets), topology (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces),\nfoundations of set theory (Boolean-valued models), measure theory\n(measure algebras), functional analysis (algebras of projections),\nand ring theory (Boolean rings).\u00a0 The study of Boolean algebras\nhas several aspects: structure theory, model theory of Boolean\nalgebras, decidability and undecidability questions for the class of\nBoolean algebras, and the indicated applications. In addition,\nalthough not explained here, there are connections to other logics,\nsubsumption as a part of special kinds of algebraic logic, finite\nBoolean algebras and switching circuit theory,\u00a0 and Boolean\nmatrices.\n",
