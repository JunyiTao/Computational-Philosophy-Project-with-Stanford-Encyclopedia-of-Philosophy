    "main_text": "Pragmatic Encroachment\n13. Contextualism\n\nOne final topic standing in need of treatment is contextualism about\nknowledge attributions, according to which the word\n\u201cknows\u201d and its cognates are context-sensitive. The\nrelationship between contextualism and the analysis of knowledge is\nnot at all straightforward. Arguably, they have different subject\nmatters (the former a word, and the latter a mental state).\nNevertheless, the methodology of theorizing about knowledge may be\nhelpfully informed by semantic considerations about the language in\nwhich such theorizing takes place. And if contextualism is correct,\nthen a theorist of knowledge must attend carefully to the potential\nfor ambiguity.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that many English words are context-sensitive.\nThe most obvious cases are indexicals, such as \u201cI\u201d,\n\u201cyou\u201d, \u201chere\u201d, and \u201cnow\u201d (David\nKaplan 1977 gives the standard view of indexicals).\n\nThe word \u201cyou\u201d refers to a different person, depending on\nthe conversational context in which it is uttered; in particular, it\ndepends on the person one is addressing. Other context-sensitive terms\nare gradable adjectives like \u201ctall\u201d\u2014how tall\nsomething must be to count as \u201ctall\u201d depends on the\nconversational context\u2014and quantifiers like\n\u201ceveryone\u201d\u2014which people count as part of\n\u201ceveryone\u201d depends on the conversational context.\nContextualists about \u201cknows\u201d think that this verb belongs\non the list of context-sensitive terms. A consequence of contextualism\nis that sentences containing \u201cknows\u201d may express distinct\npropositions, depending on the conversational contexts in which\nthey\u2019re uttered. This feature allows contextualists to offer an\neffective, though not uncontroversial, response to skepticism. For a\nmore thorough overview of contextualism and its bearing on skepticism,\nsee Rysiew 2011 or Ichikawa forthcoming-b.\n\nContextualists have modeled this context-sensitivity in various ways.\nKeith DeRose 2009 has suggested that there is a context-invariant\nnotion of \u201cstrength of epistemic position\u201d, and that how\nstrong a position one must be in in order to satisfy\n\u201cknows\u201d varies from context to context; this is in effect\nto understand the semantics of knowledge attributions much as we\nunderstand that of gradable adjectives. (How much height one must have\nto satisfy \u201ctall\u201d also varies from context to context.)\nCohen 1988 adopts a contextualist treatment of \u201crelevant\nalternatives\u201d theory, according to which, in skeptical contexts,\nbut not ordinary ones, skeptical possibilities are relevant. This\naspect is retained in the view of Lewis 1996, which characterizes a\ncontextualist approach that is more similar to quantifiers and modals.\nBlome-Tillmann 2009b and\nIchikawa forthcoming-a defend and\ndevelop the Lewisian view in different ways.\n\nContextualism and pragmatic encroachment represent different\nstrategies for addressing some of the same \u201cshifty\u201d\npatterns of intuitive data. (In fact, contextualism was generally\ndeveloped first; pragmatic encroachment theorists were motivated in\npart by the attempt to explain some of the patterns contextualists\nwere interested in without contextualism\u2019s semantic\ncommitments.) Although this represents a sense in which they tend to\nbe rival approaches, contextualism and pragmatic encroachment are by\nno means inconsistent. One could think that \u201cknows\u201d\nrequires the satisfaction of different standards in different\ncontexts, and also think that the subject\u2019s practical\nsituation is relevant for whether a given standard is satisfied.\n\nLike pragmatic encroachment, contextualism is deeply controversial.\nCritics have argued that it posits an implausible kind of semantic\nerror in ordinary speakers who do not recognize the putative\ncontext-sensitivity\u2014see Schiffer 1996 and Greenough &\nKindermann forthcoming\u2014and that it is at odds with plausible\ntheoretical principles involving knowledge\u2014see Hawthorne 2003,\nWilliamson 2005, and Worsnip forthcoming. In addition, some of the arguments\nthat are used to undercut the data motivating pragmatic encroachment\nare also taken to undermine the case for contextualism; see again\nRysiew 2001 and Brown 2006. \n",
