    "main_text": "Thematic Exposition of Levinas\u2019 Philosophy || Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence (1974): Transcendence-in-Immanence\n2.4 Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence (1974): Transcendence-in-Immanence\n\nOtherwise than Being grew up around its core fourth chapter,\nentitled \u201cSubstitution\u201d and first published in 1968 (OBBE:\n 99\u2013129).[25]\n It is a justifiable simplification to say that Levinas\u2019 concept\nof substitution corresponds to that of responsibility, explored this\ntime as immanent relationality rather than \u201cmy\u201d\nresponse to the face, understood as exteriority. In this\nwork, Levinas uses the term\n\u201cint\u00e9riorit\u00e9\u201d repeatedly, which the\ntranslator renders as \u201cinwardness\u201d, perhaps to avoid\nintroducing spatial binaries (OBBE: 28, 87, 92, 108, 119). The work is\nnot about inner-outer dichotomies, much less cognitive operations, or\nobject-memories of events or things. It has little to do with what we\ndiscover phenomenologically through reflection.\n\u201cInwardness\u201d denotes a bodily life as if haunted by\nothers, which is also now called \u201cproximity\u201d (OBBE:\n81\u201394). Comparable in this to Husserl\u2019s horizon of\napperceptions, inwardness entails a spectrum of affective tones.\nPerhaps unlike Husserl, these tones require recourse to discursive\nfigures that Levinas now borrows from psychology, poetics,\nhermeneutics, even theology and dogmatics (e.g.,\n\u201cobsession\u201d, \u201cpersecution\u201d,\n\u201crecurrence\u201d, \u201ctoo tight in its skin\u201d,\n\u201cexile\u201d, \u201cmaternity\u201d, \u201clove\u201d, and\nfinally \u201cexpiation\u201d and\n \u201ckenosis\u201d).[26]\n While thus concerned with intersubjective affectivity in its\nimmediate passive undergoing, substitution is manifest in action or\npraxis, a domain in which we experience\n immediacy.[27]\n By 1974, then, transcendence, understood as the other\n\u201coutside\u201d, has become transcendence-in-immanence, in a\nsense closer to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s account of intercorporeity,\nwhich similarly urged that philosophies of embodiment should never\noppose immanence and transcendence (mp-PP: 308). For Levinas,\nthe concept of the other would still have some reference to the face\nas expression and exteriority, but it would denote\nprincipally the \u201cinwardness\u201d of non-object forming\nmemories, whose affective return or \u201crecurrence\u201d\ncomplexifies the linear time-structure of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenological consciousness (OBBE: 88).\n2.4.1 The Structure of the Work\n\nOtherwise than Being opens with a general overview of the\nargument, in which being and transcendence are also named\n\u201cessence\u201d and \u201cdisinterest\u201d. Emphasizing the\nprocessual quality of being, Levinas will refer to it equivalently as\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d, venturing that\nhe might even have used the dynamic form essance (OBBE: 187\nnote 1). Responsibility will be focused and discussed as the condition\nof possibility of all verbal signification (OBBE: 43\u201347). But\nthe themes of conversation and teaching recede into the background. He\nnow makes a more strategic use of the body as flesh, that is, as a\nlocus with simultaneously an inside and an outside, as in\nMerleau-Ponty. Subjectivity is again framed affectively as the coming\nto pass of responsibility, although this time the phenomenological\nanalysis of intentionality is analyzed into its primitive layer of\nsensibility that Levinas calls \u201cpre-originary susceptiveness\n[susception pr\u00e9-originaire]\u201d (OBBE: 122,\n136\u2013138). For him, that means that subjectivity always entails\npre-cognitive dimensions that are from the outset intersubjectively\nconditioned. The other has become other-in-the-same, as indicated. But\nthe other-in-the-same is not objectively different from the\nfactical other who faces me, because neither are objects and both are\nexpressions or modes of alterity. As we will see, the\nother-in-the-same describes a pre-thematic \u201cinvestiture\u201d\n(because I never know when I first experienced this other in\nme; OBBE: 125): \u201cAll my inwardness is invested in the form of a\ndespite-me, for-another\u201d (OBBE: 11). In Otherwise than\nBeing, Levinas has returned to Husserl\u2019s inquiries into\npassive synthesis, to the latter\u2019s perplexities about the\nstretch of retentions of passive experiences, about the unbidden\nspontaneity of our associations, and the near-infinity of sensuous\nhorizons\u2014all part of a process unfolding in what Husserl called\nin 1926 \u201ca phenomenology of the so-called unconscious\u201d\n(Husserl 2001: 201 and \u201cAppendix 19\u201d 512\u2013519). In\nlight of this return, we should not approach interiority and\nexteriority as opposed terms, but as dimensions of intersubjectivity\nand the inhabitation of a self by alterity.\n\nThe second chapter approaches Heidegger\u2019s discussion of language\nas the way in which being becomes, the way it temporalizes (he-BT:\n \u00a768).[28]\n Levinas revisits Heidegger\u2019s argument that the logos\ngathers up being and makes possible its unveiling\n(al\u0113theia). He will argue that the lapse of time\nbetween lived immediacy and its reflective representation is\nnever fully gathered by the logos. Therefore, the\ntemporal lapse poses a challenge to language understood as\nHeidegger\u2019s gathering and it falls, much the way that\ntranscendence as interruption did in 1961, outside the realm of being,\neven though Levinas still considers being a process of totalization,\nsomething all-encompassing. This rethinking of the lapse along with\ntranscendence-in-immanence will be Levinas\u2019 ultimate\nmodification of Heidegger\u2019s project. Together, the lapse and\nthis new conception of transcendence do ultimately pass through\nlanguage as words addressed. I will come back to this. For now,\nsuffice it to say that it is the inhabitation of a self by alterity\nthat forms the sensuous conditions of possibility of speech. Thus it\nis not being that addresses us through language, it is a quite\ndifferent alterity.\n\nTwo additional innovations in Otherwise than Being include:\n(1) the proposed phenomenological reduction to the birth of meaning in\na bodily self that carries what it cannot identify as\nproperly itself (the \u201cother\u201d, affectively). This appears\nto be a radicalization of Husserl\u2019s discussion of the\npre-reflective ego in Ideas II (\u00a758, \u201cSupplement\n12\u201d \u00a7\u00a72\u20133). Whereas Husserl emphasized the basis\nof the ego in its ongoing flow of lived experience, which he said was\n\u201clawful\u201d, Levinas focuses on the discontinuity of time\nconsciousness (see also Franck 1981 [2014: 149\u2013166]). (2) A\nhermeneutics of the self, emerging through intersubjective contact in\nwhich the \u201cproximity\u201d of the other elicits passive\n\u201csubstitution\u201d and opens onto spontaneous communication\n(OBBE: 113\u2013121). In what suggests an attempt at deepening\nHusserl\u2019s concept of empathy (Einf\u00fchlung; OBBE:\n125), the figures of proximity, recurrence, and substitution\ncharacterize the intersubjective intertwining that makes communication\npossible: \u201cCommunication would be impossible if it should have\nto begin in the ego, a free subject, to whom every other would be only\na limitation that invites war\u201d (OBBE: 119). Indeed, prior to\nspoken or written language, prior to signs reciprocally exchanged,\n\u201cwe suppose that there is in the transcendence involved in\nlanguage a relationship that is not empirical speech, but\nresponsibility\u201d (OBBE: 120). As \u201cmy pre-originary\nsusceptiveness\u201d, the nature of intersubjective\nsensibility shares its time-structure with strong passions, sometimes\nindeed with trauma (OBBE: 122\u2013124). As Levinas writes: \n\n\n[this susceptiveness] describes the suffering and vulnerability of the\nsensible as the other in me \u2026. the ipseity [also known\nas embodied selfhood] has become at odds with itself in its return to\nitself. The self-accusation of remorse gnaws away at the closed and\nfirm core of consciousness \u2026 fissioning it \n\n\nin its temporal unity (OBBE: 124\u2013125). Consequently,\nvulnerability and sensitivity to trauma not only provoke retreat into\nself but heighten our awareness, however tenuous, of our connection\nwith the other(s), and they motivate our bearing witness. Thus the\naffective in-habitation of my self by others precedes speech-acts and\nspeech-communities. If the reverse were the case; that is, if a de\nfacto community were posited as prior to the event of words\naddressed, then this would presuppose what it was meant to show: the\ngenesis of speech-acts (OBBE: 92). Instead, \u2018beneath\u2019\nwords proffered lies a fundamental vulnerability that psychology might\ninterpret as a predisposition to witnessing, from oneself to the\nother. Levinas calls this vulnerability the \u201cSaying\u201d\n(OBBE: 149\u2013152). It is both precursive to words uttered in the\nform of address (i.e., pre-linguistic), and it would accompany\ncommunication like its affective horizon. The duality of Saying and\nSaid is a new concept in Levinas\u2019 late work.\n\nBuilding on the exploration of proximity begun in chapter three,\nchapters four and five evince a tone more somber than any found\nhitherto in Levinas\u2019 \u0153uvre. This is in keeping\nwith the dedication of the book, written in Hebrew and in French,\nwhich announces that it will be a work of mourning. While Derrida\ncharacterized Totality and Infinity as a phenomenology of\nhospitality (Derrida 1997 [1999: 21]), Otherwise than Being\ncommemorates the \u201cvictims of the \u2026 hatred of the other\nman\u201d. It develops the parallel between semiotic\n\u201csubstitution\u201d of a word for a thing (or the signifying\nfunction of all language) and the spontaneous substitution of myself\nfor an other (implied by a spectrum of acts of self-sacrifice), which\nLevinas calls the one-for-the-other (OBBE: 45\u201350, 70\u201374,\n119\u2013129). Whereas Heidegger had explored the hermeneutics of\nDa-sein, for whom communication unfolds thanks to our (as\nDa-sein) taking or equivalently offering \u201cthis [thing\nor word] as that [thing]\u201d (he-BT: \u00a731), Levinas will\narguably set Heidegger\u2019s \u201cas\u201d into his\n \u201cfor\u201d:[29]\n Heidegger\u2019s \u201cthis as that\u201d becomes\nLevinas\u2019 \u201cone for the other\u201d of\nsubstitution. While responsibility expressed the unfolding of the\nintersubjective affects that Levinas compared to Plato\u2019s\n\u201cGood beyond Being\u201d in 1961 (TI: 292\u2013293,\n304\u2013307), the good of substitution is more ambiguous, occurring\n\u201con the brink of tears and laughter\u201d (OBBE: 18), yet also\n\u201cglorious\u201d (OBBE: 94, 140\u2013144).\n\nThe experience of time characteristic of trauma, and mourning, does\nnot take the place of Husserlian phenomenology\u2019s\nflowing-yet-always-also-present (str\u00f6mend-stehend)\n time-consciousness,[30]\n any more than it replaces the succession and uninterruptedness of\nclock time. If what-is results from the self-giving of things to the\nfocus of phenomenological attention, and if together they invariably\nfind a place in the formal flow of time-consciousness, then even for\nHusserl what-is, i.e. being, must temporalize. Husserl had always\nurged that, insofar as there is appearing, there is being as well\n(hu-CM: \u00a746; also see Heidegger, he-BT: \u00a77). For Heidegger,\nbeing temporalized through Da-sein, which was\nout-ahead-of-itself or oriented toward its future. Yet if, in both\ntheir cases, being unfolds temporally, then for Levinas, our\nsensibility shows a different temporal character, because the\nsensibility called the other-in-the-same returns and repeats rather\nthan flows. Like trauma and mourning, responsibility in its new somber\ntones recurs without definitively halting the flow of\ntime-consciousness. This is why Levinas referred to the cluster of\nconcepts around substitution as adverbial: they pass through\nbeing (understood as verbal or processual) and its time, and they\nmodify it. Indeed, when being is understood as the verbal dynamism\nexpressed by \u201cessence\u201d, then responsibility and\nsubstitution can only be compared to ad-verbs. Hence the title,\nautrement, other-wise or \u2018otherly\u2019 than being\n(OBBE: 35).\n\nThe final half of chapter five recurs to the performative register of\nlanguage to convey the tension of a consciousness striving to\nconsolidate itself in the wake of alterity as affective investiture,\nby which its passivity slowly becomes active witnessing. This opening\nout of inward affects becoming gestures of generosity motivates\nOtherwise than Being\u2019s recourse to a new, performative\nlanguage. Thus, Levinas adds, \n\n\nand I still interrupt the ultimate discourse in which all the\ndiscourses are stated, in saying it to one that listens \u2026 That is\ntrue of the discussion I am elaborating at this very moment. (OBBE:\n 170)[31]\n\n\n\nAware of the seemingly artificial quality of calling his authorial\nwitness \u201cimmediate\u201d, Levinas\u2019 claim is nevertheless\nmore than a literary artifice. Basterra compares it to Kant\u2019s\nidea of autonomy, which shows itself only when we follow a law that\n\u201cexceeds and addresses the subject\u201d, motivating our\nethical act (Basterra 2015: 126). Earlier in her study, she\nhad argued that the intellectual affect of Achtung was\ncapable of focusing our attention and opening us to a respect\ncomparable to Levinas\u2019 Saying, which he also calls\n\u201csincerity\u201d. For pure reason, autonomy \u201cis therefore\nan illusion\u201d, but it is one only insofar as that which is not\nintrinsically part of my interests can still motivate me to\nact. Thus pure reason erroneously supposes that my ethical gesture\ncame from me (Basterra 2015: 129). Levinas provides us a\ncrucial hermeneutics of the intersubjective origin of this Kantian\n\u201cillusion\u201d. He sets our misinterpretation of heteronomy as\nautonomy in Kant\u2019s practical reason into a hermeneutic register,\nreferring to the sincerity and substitution underlying the words we\noffer: \u201cIt is in the risky uncovering of oneself, in sincerity,\nthe breaking up of inwardness \u2026 exposure to traumas,\nvulnerability\u201d that I bear witness to, and for another (OBBE:\n48). Again, it does not come from us. Levinas finds illustrations of\nsuch witnessing in many places, from the justice imperative of the\nprophets to the concern of Latin American clerics over the events\nunfolding in Chile in 1973 (OGCM 81\u201382).\n2.4.2 New Existential Moods and Fleshly Memories\n\nAs in his 1935 discussion of need and nausea, Otherwise than\nBeing argues that lived sensibility often overflows\nrepresentation. And again, Levinas suggests sensuous modes different\nfrom Heidegger\u2019s Befindlichkeiten (see\n \u00a72.2 above),\n in which all understanding takes place for Heidegger (he-BT: 17).\nIndeed, interwoven layers of affectivity are unfolded in Otherwise\nthan Being. Levinas explores the sensuous-affective\nproto-experience of the other in light of new moods, writing:\n\u201cRemorse is the trope of the literal sense of sensibility. In\nits passivity is erased the distinction between being accused and\naccusing oneself\u201d (OBBE: 125). Unlike Existence and\nExistents, wherein light overcame the distinction between\nsubjects and objects, allowing the subject to make the object\nintelligible within its horizon of appearing (EE: 41), Otherwise\nthan Being approaches transcendence in sensuous and temporal\nterms, arguing inter alia for the insistence of a past that\neludes thematization (OBBE: 122\u2013123). In that sense,\ntranscendence for an embodied being is always\ntranscendence-in-immanence. The affective \u201cexperience\u201d of\nmy relations with particular others is thus preserved as a trace or\npre-thematic reminiscence of the flesh, as \u201ca relationship with\na singularity without the mediation of any principle, any\nideality\u201d (OBBE: 100). Invoking Otherwise than Being\n(OBBE: 105\u2013107), John Llewelyn has called this affective\ndimension of invested selfhood, or \u201cipseity\u201d, a\n\u201c\u2018deep\u2019 saying\u201d that \u201cbears witness to\nwhat is neither recollected nor forgotten in the epistemic\nsense of these terms when [or once] it is represented as a\nsign\u201d (Llewelyn 2002b:\n 135).[32]\n\nAs indicated, Otherwise than Being problematizes\nLevinas\u2019 earlier, more ontological approach on the basis of\nHusserl\u2019s inquiries into passive syntheses and\nEinf\u00fchlung (empathy). There is good reason for this.\nResponsibility denoted an event that repeats, and even increases as it\nis assumed (already TI: 100\u2013101). In Otherwise than\nBeing, however, the question of immanence and passivity arises in\nregard to responsibility\u2019s unremarked persistence and its\naffective upwellings in us. This is because the status of a memory of\nsensuous events, which affect us before we represent them, is\nelusive. For the phenomenologist, it might correspond to an\napperception or horizon, in the sense of something not directly\nperceived. Thus Levinas also insists that, unlike the apperceptions\nHusserl was able to explore thanks to the reduction he set on\n memory,[33]\nthis affective past continues to elude thematization because\nit was never an intentional object at all, and because memories of our\nlived flesh precede the consolidation of our ego (OBBE:\n144\u2013147). John Drabinski has explored this\n\u201cpre-history\u201d in light of Levinas\u2019 reprise of\ngenetic phenomenology (2001: 185\u2013206). Theodore de Boer\napproaches it as an echo of both Rosenzweig and Jewish prophetism\n(1997: 87\u2013100). Of course, Levinas is aware that such a\ntemporality is open to skeptical critique. He even reminds us that\nskepticism itself obeys an ethical imperative to deconstruct\nphilosophy and with it, all totalizing discourses, whether they are\nlogical or political (OBBE: 168\u2013170).\n\nLevinas does not propose a solution to the conundrum of how\nnon-objective memories can be translated into objects for\nphilosophical reflection. His aim is to deconstruct dialogue down to\nits embodied condition of possibility, and this leads to a discussion\nwhich is not so unlike Husserl\u2019s genetic inquiries into\n\u201cproto-intentionality [Urintentionalit\u00e4t]\u201d\nexplored in the 1920s. Unlike Husserl, however, he does not aim at a\nsystem consisting of levels of drives and affects formatted by higher\negoic structures (Husserl, E Manuscript III 9/5a, cited in\nhu-GDP: lixff). Yet he does exploit a difficulty that beset\nHusserl\u2019s early phenomenology of time-consciousness, one that\nwould argue in favor of Levinas\u2019 1974 conception of\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d, or the interruption that he equates with\ntranscendence-in-immanence. This was the paradox of sensation in\nrelation to intentionality that Husserl identified in Appendix 12 of\nhis lectures on internal time consciousness (Hua 10:\n 130\u2013133).[34]\n In his 1965 essay, \u201cIntentionality and Sensation\u201d (DEH:\n135\u2013150), Levinas focused on the gap (i.e., diachrony) between\nbodily sensation entering intentionality and sensation as\npre-conscious bodily processes. He recalled the paradox that the\nsensuous origins of intentionality lay outside\nintentionality\u2019s field or reach, in the body, even as the\nongoing alterations of sensation forge our feeling of ongoing temporal\nprogression. To be explicitly experienced, sensation thus had\nto intentionalize. Yet much of its prior, bodily existence eludes our\nconsciousness.\n\nLevinas compared this dual, conscious-preconscious status of\nsensibility to his idea of a pre-intentional \u201creceptivity of an\n\u2018other\u2019 penetrating into the \u2018same\u2019, [in sum,\nto our intersubjective] life and not [to] \u2018thought\u2019\u201d\n(DEH: 144). As already broached by Husserl, this sensuous\n\u201cother\u201d will support Levinas\u2019 1974 arguments for the\naffective interruptions of the even flow of time-consciousness, and\nhis claim that intersubjective affects overflow the framework of all\nrepresentational\n consciousness.[35]\n Sophie Veulemans has fruitfully compared Levinas\u2019 diachrony\nwith Bergson\u2019s approach to the \u201cnew\u201d in the midst of\nduration (Veulemans 2008). Rudolf Bernet, in turn, equates the newness\nof the phenomenological instant with \u201cthe root of all alterity\nand all difference\u201d in Levinas, which allows Bernet to urge that\nthe intersubjective investiture of the subject \u201cwill always\n[prove] unthinkable in a philosophy of consciousness\u201d (Bernet\n2002: 92). Following his argument, phenomenology would not have\nadequately thought through the sensuous way \u201cin which the other\nliberates the subject from its captivity within\n \u2026 immanence\u201d (Bernet 2002: 93).\n2.4.3 The Saying and the Said\n\nOtherwise than Being involves an innovative discussion of\nsignification. Given Levinas\u2019 hermeneutic insight that language\nis not merely a system of words paired up with pre-existing, objective\nrealities, but instead brings reality to light, language and time will\nhave analogous functions. That is, both make meaning possible as the\nrealization of our world. Indeed, while Heidegger had argued that\nbeing resonates in (poetic) language, as the verb \u201cto be\u201d,\nLevinas, as we have seen, had counter-argued for an otherwise than\nbeing that showed itself in ad-verbial meaning. Yet, if the\nrelationship between language and being is fully encompassing, even in\na sense mystical, as it is for Heidegger, then either Levinas\u2019\notherwise than being looks like mere speculation, or it simply inheres\nin being or participates in its verb-like transcendence. Either way,\nfundamental ontology thereby proves primordial and weakens\nLevinas\u2019 claims. Yet for the latter, transcendence in fact\npoints to the temporality that, as we have seen, already differs from\nphenomenology\u2019s totalizing flow or the way Heidegger\u2019s\nbeing temporalizes through Da-sein (i.e., as\nout-ahead-of-itself toward its ownmost possibility; OBBE:\n169\u2013170, 178\u2013182). The lapse of time between the\npre-intentional sensuous moment and its intentionalization denotes the\ntranscendence that Levinas also equates with \u201cthe Saying\u201d\n(OBBE: 37\u201355). His discussion of the Saying correlates with his\ntreatment of sincerity, introduced already in Existence and\nExistents. Otherwise than Being radicalizes his notion\nof sincerity, insisting that the structure of sensibility is always as\nif punctuated by sensuous lapses. It is thanks to such time lapses\nthat we are open and able to communicate because, as we have seen,\nproximity is an affective mode that motivates dialogue. While\nall sensuous lapses are not necessarily openings to\nintersubjective communication, proximity and vulnerability are the\nloci of transcendence-in-immanence and the birth of\nsignification (whether words are actually uttered or not). For\nLevinas, there is more in living affectivity than Heidegger\u2019s\nconception of being speaking through language captured. This is clear\nthe moment we understand signification originally as an affective\nproto-intentionality and not as some thought, already formulated, that\nthe I thereupon chooses to communicate to another (OBBE: 43).\n\nLevinas thus conceives language as more than denotation and\ndescription. Already verbs escape the coupling of words with things\nthat we find in the case of the noun. \u201cIn the verb of apophansis\n[predication], which is the verb properly so called, the verb\n\u2018to be\u2019, essence resounds and is heard\u201d (OBBE: 41).\n\u201cRed reddens\u201d without requiring conversion into\npropositions; sounds resound in music and poetry. Nevertheless, a verb\ncan be converted into a noun, thereby losing its processual\nquality. \n\n\nThrough the ambiguousness of the logos \u2026 the verb par excellence\n[\u2018being\u2019] in which essence resounds \u2026 is nominalized,\nbecomes a word designating and sanctioning identities, assembling\ntime \u2026 into a conjuncture. (OBBE: 42) \n\n\nThus, even the verbality or event-like quality of being can take on a\nnominal form, such as in \u201ca being\u201d. Levinas calls\nthis convertibility \u201cthe amphibology of being and\nentities\u201d (OBBE: 43). While this back-and-forth reference\nexpresses the danger of taking being for a thing\u2014a danger about\nwhich Heidegger warns us\u2014the amphibology also fails to grasp\nfully the reflexive quality of verbs like se dire, understood\nas \u201cto say\u201d but in a passive sense, as though one were\nsaying oneself, self-communicating. Levinas then sets\nhis ethical-hermeneutic \u201creduction\u201d on the\nreflexive particle se, urging that, although being\n\u201cspeaks\u201d through the logos, the se\npoints toward an intersubjective mode of our embodied sensuous\npassivity (OBBE: 43\u201345). This passivity is enigmatic because the\nse is not a verb and cannot really be made into a noun. It is\nin its enigmatic structure that the vulnerability that arises in\nproximity as if grounds signification, and words said, to another. To\nthis reflexive se, or \u201cself\u201d, corresponds our\npassivity, as it occurs in the temporal lapse called\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d. Diachrony thus expresses our sincerity toward\nthe other and a certain transcendence: \u201cthe spirit hears the\necho of the otherwise\u201d (OBBBE: 44). With the adverb\n(\u201cotherwise\u201d), a modalization of fleshly\ninvestiture momentarily escapes the nominalization flowing out of the\naforementioned amphibology between verbs and nouns, between being and\na being. Here we find the ultimate sense of transcendence,\nwhich Levinas compares with Merleau-Ponty\u2019s \u201cfundamental\nhistoricity\u201d, those unremarked, passive bodily sedimentations\nthat make up our selfhood (OBBE: 45).\n2.4.4 Hermeneutics and Jewish Philosophy\n\nLevinas\u2019 later work, notably Otherwise than Being, has\nbeen characterized as hermeneutic. Focusing on the discussions of the\nother-in-the-same and passivity in that work, commentator Giuseppe\nLissa provides an apt description of Levinas\u2019 interpretive\nproject. By investigating the depths of consciousness, by comparing\nits passivity to the process of ageing, Levinas investigates a \n\n\nreality unknowable, but perhaps interpretable by a thinking that no\nlonger claims to be an exercise in knowledge \u2026 because this\nthinking is engaged in the search for a meaning that precedes all\nknowledge. \n\n\nLissa concludes that Levinas intimates a meaning that, in\n\u201cpreceding [knowledge], founds it, orients it, and to some\ndegree justifies it\u201d (Lissa 2002: 227). For him, Levinas\u2019\nturn to hermeneutics largely dates from his abandonment of his\nphenomenology of \u201cexteriority\u201d, as the subtitle of\nTotality and Infinity indicates: An Essay on\nExteriority. As we have seen, insofar as the search for meaning\nunderlying intentional object-constitution (and other modes of\nintentionality) presupposes a meaning only incipiently\ngrasped\u2014which corresponds to Heidegger\u2019s rethinking of\nhermeneutics in light of Da-sein\u2019s basic\nunderstanding\u2014Levinas appears to owe a debt both to\nHeidegger\u2019s existential\n hermeneutics[36]\n as well as to a much older, polyphonic practice of reading: Talmudic\nthought as interpretively elaborating Jewish law (Halakhah)\nand recounting and parsing narratives (Aggadah). Because this\nhermeneutics differs from that of Christian theology by giving\nsignificantly less weight to philosophical justifications of\nfaith, it is worth our turning briefly to it.\n\nLevinas presented twenty-three Talmudic readings in the context of the\nColloques des intellectuels juifs de langue fran\u00e7aise.\nHowever, in 1957, at the first meeting of the colloquium, he merely\nparticipated in the debates. Salomon Malka reminds us of one of his\nprofoundly hermeneutic observations: \n\n\nJudaism is not a religion, the word doesn\u2019t exist in Hebrew; it\nis much more than that, it is an understanding of being. The\nJews introduced into history the idea of hope and that of a\nfuture \u2026. Moreover, Jews have the sentiment that their\nobligations toward the other person come before their obligations in\nregard to God. (Malka 2002: 42, my trans., emph. added) \n\n\nThis remark already shows us two important things. First, that Judaism\nmight be an \u201cunderstanding of being\u201d implies that this\nunderstanding is profoundly aware of its finitude and, by extension,\nhas to be an ongoing process. It helps us grasp how it is that Levinas\nfound resources in Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics, both utilizing\nand criticizing its approach. Second, that our obligations to\nthe other person somehow come before duties toward God (from rituals\nto norms), and occasionally also abrogate these duties, already opens\na secular, or better, a human-oriented dimension within Judaism.\n\nThe relationship between Levinas\u2019 thought, its Jewish\ninfluences, and phenomenological philosophy has given rise to multiple\nevaluations. Martin Kavka argues that \u201cLevinas understood both\nJudaism and Western philosophy as engaging in structurally similar\nforms of thinking\u201d (Kavka 2010: 20\u201321). He situates the\nstructural similarity in that \u201cboth [these intellectual\ncorpuses] consist of texts that point to what cannot be brought to\npresence\u201d and consequently work on, or between, the dimensions\nof reference, explanation, and hermeneutic pre-comprehension (cf.\nOuaknin 1993: 225 [1995:\n 155\u2013156]).[37]\n Yet Kavka adds that Levinas\u2019 relationship to the Jewish canon\nis also \u201cinherently muddy\u201d, though it is also clear that\nthere is more than one canon, more than a single\ninterpretation thereof. Indeed, both Michael Fagenblat and Kavka agree\nthat \u201cit is not clear \u2026 that \u2026 a \u2018new\ndirection\u2019 in Jewish philosophy is [ever] really new\u201d\n(Kavka 2010: 21). Moreover, Fagenblat has argued that Levinas\u2019\nethics prolongs, in a phenomenological-hermeneutic register,\n\u201cthe dispersal of [modern approaches to the] Judeo-Christian God\nin social life\u201d (Fagenblat 2010: 196).[38]\n He also examines the hermeneutic extension that Otherwise than\nBeing gives to Totality and Infinity. Both commentators\nsuggest that Levinas\u2019 increasingly critical stance toward the\nepistemological and foundationalist aspects of Husserlian\nphenomenology motivated him to extend his hermeneutic recourse beyond\nHeidegger\u2019s Existenzphilosophie toward Jewish thought,\nincluding Neo-Platonic currents and Maimonides (Fagenblat 2010:\n97\u2013110).[39]\n,\n[40]\n But it can also be argued that Levinas\u2019 hermeneutics begins\nwell before Otherwise than Being. His reinterpretation of\nbeing-in-the-world, the meaning of facticity, the creation of a\ndwelling, and even his reading of eros and the family in 1961\nentail interpretive choices, indebted to at least two significant\nhermeneutic themes: Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of our\npre-comprehension of existence and Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s approach\nto Jewish life in The Star of Redemption (Rosenzweig 1921\n[2005]).\n\nIn 1961, Levinas wrote that Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of\nRedemption was \u201ctoo often present in this book\n[Totality and Infinity] to be cited\u201d (TI: 28), and\nnumerous are the commentaries on the presence of Rosenzweig in\nLevinas\u2019\n work.[41]\n It is important to recall that Rosenzweig had been a scholar of Hegel\nuntil the experience of the trenches in World War I motivated his\nrethinking of idealist political philosophy and Christian universality\nmore broadly. The Star of Redemption is a complex work\nanalyzing the respective tasks of Jewish and Christian wisdom and\nritual. Peter Eli Gordon argues that Rosenzweig is \n\n\na post-Nietzschean philosopher, in that, like Heidegger, he denies\nthat human meaning is intelligible independent of a life-context.\nTemporal hermeneutics thus replaces the transcendental search for\nessence. (Gordon 2003: 185) \n\n\nThe same could be said of Levinas. Since he conceives temporality in\nhuman terms (as opposed to eternity or stasis), meaning\nitself can only be approached in light of time. Readers familiar with\nRosenzweig\u2019s \u201cnew thinking\u201d may know that he\nsituated one of the principal hermeneutic differences between Judaism\nand Christianity in the way their theologies\n\u2018temporalized\u2019: Christianity being oriented around the\nlife and death of the incarnate God, an event whose occurrence lies in\nthe past; Judaism, on the other hand, being future-oriented, awaiting\nthe messiah (who does not come).\n\nLevinas took up the question of meaning and temporality in a way\nsomewhat different from both Rosenzweig and Heidegger. In 1961, as we\nhave seen, his phenomenology of hospitality proceeded on the\npresent-time of love of life and the encounter called the\nface-to-face. However, the place where he explicitly uses the term\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d therein concerns precisely a secularized\nmessianic future. This is the chapter entitled \u201cPhenomenology of\nEros\u201d, which deploys \u201ca phenomenological model for the\nultimate term of our desire\u201d, as Fagenblat puts it (2010:\n93). The argument would be this: before eros is sublimated in\ncivil society, eros and (sometimes) the family bring to light\nour concern with others in their particularity and difference,\nindependently of their biological or social roles. We can take the\nfamily as a \u201cmodel\u201d here, in the Frankfurt School\u2019s\nsense of\n\n\n\nan intellectual construction \u2026 [whose elements] are borrowed from\nempirical experiences that have already shown their worth such that\nthe elements used appear henceforth obvious. (Broch 2008: 43) \n\n\nThe phenomenology of eros opens a future of\n\u201celection\u201d within the family and perhaps beyond it.\nDespite the apparent heterosexism of his formulations, Levinas\nintroduces abiding concern for singularity and uniqueness by defining\nthe figure of paternity as the possibility of electing each son in his\nspecificity, even as the latter may serve (and clash with) his\nbrothers. Consistent with a model, the family is both figure and\nreality. It serves Levinas\u2019 hermeneutic secularization of\nmessianic future-time through the succession of generations.\nInterestingly, eros unfolds \u201cphenomenologically\u201d\nin much the same way as did the proto-experience of the \u201cthere\nis\u201d (il y a). That is, it unfolds in a darkness\noverlooked by phenomenologies that rely on light and the universal\nevidence that light enables (TI: 256). There would consequently be a\nneglected underside to the phenomenological account of\nobject-constitution, which precedes and accompanies\nintentionality\u2019s encounter with objects. And that\nrequires hermeneutics.\n\nLike Fagenblat, scholars from David Banon to Marc-Alain Ouaknin have\nexplored the hermeneutic dimension of Levinas\u2019 thought, even\nbeyond his Talmudic readings that delve into the many-voiced debates\nbetween the rabbis of the Mishna and the Gemara (the oldest and\nsubsequent transcriptions of Jewish oral traditions; Banon 1987).\nIndeed, as Ouaknin points out, in the case of Talmudic and Biblical\nhermeneutics, Levinas always considered the eminence of a\nbook\u2014what defines it as \u201cthe Book\u201d\u2014to be less\nits themes than its structure. Levinas focuses \u201con the\nstructure of the Book of books inasmuch as it allows for exegesis\n[hermeneutics], and on its unique status of containing more than it\n contains\u201d.[42]\n Hermeneutics is thus engendered by excesses of potential\nmeaning over senses already printed on the page, or even discerned by\nthe reception traditions of the work. It would thus be the specific\narchitecture of the book that conditions its reception. Moreover, the\nparallelisms that we have seen\u2014between the Saying and the Said\nand between temporal diachrony and synchrony\u2014are also\nfound at the literary level in Biblical and Talmudic texts, with their\nopenness to ongoing interpretation. Levinas even equates\n\u201crevelation\u201d with the call of the text to each\nreader or listener, who thereby becomes responsible for its\ninterpretation. \u201cThe Revelation as calling to the unique within\nme is the significance particular to the signifying of the\nRevelation\u201d of the text, which is understood as dialogical to\nits core. Here we see the structural analogy between the call of the\nother and my response that begins as Saying, as opening to words\naddressed. Levinas adds, \n\n\nthe totality of the true is constituted from the contribution of\nmultiple people, the uniqueness of each act of listening carrying the\nsecret of the text; the voice of the Revelation, as\ninflected \u2026 by each person\u2019s ear, would be necessary to the\n\u2018Whole\u2019 of the truth. (BTV: 133\u2013134) \n\n\nHermeneutic truth here becomes the responsibility of an open\ncommunity, as much as an invitation to participation extended to each\npossible listener. That is why Levinas could urge that Scripture be\nunderstood as a call to respond as readily as could proximity,\nsubstitution, and responsibility, all of which similarly express the\nethical investiture that results in words offered.\n\nLevinas\u2019 hermeneutics might nevertheless be deemed immanent,\nconcerning one book and one community. Although commentators like\nBatnitzky find in Levinas a project for a modern politics, and thus\nfor universality, others are skeptical about her claim. Trigano\nobjects that Levinas\u2019 ethics unfolds out of a sort of non-site,\nstarting with the category of the singular. \u201cFor Levinas\u201d,\nhe argues, \n\n\nit is ethically imperative to think the singular in order that the\nhorizon of the other person arise. The universal is, in effect, a\ndangerous game that can lead to totality and to the negation of the\nother person. To decide in favor of the singular is to avoid such a\ndevelopment \n\n\nand with it, a politics (Trigano 2002: 173). In short, the original\nhermeneutic turn that Levinas gives to Husserlian and Heideggerian\nphenomenologies has left commentators with questions about the\nrelationship between an immanent hermeneutics and one concerned with\npolitics as the sphere of the universal. These questions imply\ndiscussions about politics in our time from which Levinas\nwould have refrained in his time, in the wake of the Shoah, when\npolitics seemed less important than questions of the survival and\nfuture of Jewish communities. Yet this apparent absence of politics\nexplains why Michel Haar (1991: 530) asked of Levinas whether his\nethics could really unfold outside any site, outside any positive\nreciprocity, and outside all objectivation (cited by Trigano 2002:\n175, note 79). Indeed, Trigano criticizes Levinas, urging that the\ndialectical relationship between singular experience and universal\nmeaning (and institutions) implies that philosophy should have a\nminimal relationship to politics, \n\n\nwhich is the very field in which the disjunction between the universal\nand the singular \u2026 is established, and this disjunction\u2014so\nfar as it is at once the separation of the same and the other and\n[yet] also the path of their alliance \u2026 is the very condition of\npossibility of the other. (Trigano 2002: 176) \n\n\nOn Trigano\u2019s account, it follows that Levinas\u2019\nhermeneutics only partly responded to Jews\u2019 post-war need for\nthe universalization of their experience, at a human level\nencompassing both theory and politics (Trigano 2002: 176). This does\nnot contradict Batnitzky\u2019s reading, which considers\nLevinas\u2019 \u0153uvre as a whole. But it can certainly be\nargued that universalization in Levinas\u2019 ethics remains largely\nformal. On this question turns the important matter of what it means\nto develop a Jewish philosophy. And it is fair to say that\n\n\n\nthe universal, the neo-Kantian ethicization of Judaism emerged in\nruins from the Shoah, the more so that the essential question of\npolitical philosophy today is that of the place of the singular within\nthe political universal. (Trigano 2002: 177) \n\n\nIf we accept this claim, then any comparison between Levinas and a\npre-Shoah Jewish thinker goes only part way toward addressing the\nproblem of Jewish hermeneutic philosophy today.\n2.4.5 The Third Party, Illeity, and Politics\n\nJacques Derrida once called Totality and Infinity a\n\u201ctreatise on hospitality\u201d (1997 [1999: 21]). As we have\nseen, Levinas\u2019 1961 work approached being as war or a conflict\nof wills that persist in their existence like the philosophical\ntradition\u2019s concept of conatus essendi (the will to\npersist in being). Neutral existence or the there-is (il\ny a) denoted indeterminate nocturnal being, which gives way to\nthe diurnal being called \u201cthe elemental\u201d (sunlight, winds,\nrain). As noted, being in Levinas thus entails both dynamic forces and\na conception of natural processes and causality. However, hospitality,\nalso called \u201cmetaphysical desire\u201d (TI: 33), cannot be\ngrounded on such forces, much less on a conception of the will as\nbased on drives of self-preservation or self-expansion. And, because\nhospitality is elicited by the other\u2014and is\nnon-reciprocal\u2014it does not presuppose an original social\nexchange, much less moral sentiments or innate emotive capacities for\nempathy or compassion. If it did, there would be no question of\nescaping a so-called natural order of existence. That is why\nLevinas\u2014aware that the concept of nature has a debated\nhistory\u2014characterizes both our response to the other and, in\n1974, proximity, as \u201cpre-natural signification\u201d (OBBE:\n68). He explains, \n\n\n[i]n renouncing intentionality as a guiding thread toward the\neidos [formal structure] of the psyche \u2026 our analysis\nwill follow sensibility in its pre-natural signification to the\nmaternal, where, in proximity [to what is not itself], signification\nsignifies before it gets bent into perseverance in\nbeing in the midst of a Nature. (OBBE: 68, emph. added) \n\n\nIn order to clarify this, Levinas had to develop further concepts. In\n1961, he referred to our desire for the other as\n\u201creligion\u201d (\u201cthe bond \u2026 established between the\nsame and the other\u201d that does not totalize) and as\n\u201ctransascendence\u201d. \u201cTranscendence, like desire and\ninadequation, is necessarily a transascendence\u201d (respectively\nTI: 41, 35). By 1974, Levinas calls \u201cilleity\u201d the value\nand dignity of responding to another person. He defines illeity as\n\n\n\na neologism formed with il (he) or ille, [whereby\nalterity] indicates a way of concerning me without entering into\nconjunction with me. (OBBE: 12; also 13\u201316, 147\u2013162) \n\n\nBeyond the concept of the third party introduced in Totality and\nInfinity, \u201cilleity\u201d also refers to something\nabsolute, even divine, in the other. We can see here how our\nresponsibility to the other person thus almost stands in the place of\nour responsibility to God, which, as we have seen, is an important\nhermeneutic dimension of Judaism.\n\nThe question remains, as it did already in Totality and\nInfinity: How do responsibility and transcendence thereupon enter\ninto the ongoing flow of time and the totality of being? And how does\nan investiture of this affective intensity pass into rationality? As\nin the 1961 work, we find in 1974 that the \u201cthird\nparty\u201d\u2014denoting both other people and the reprise of\nintentionality\u2014similarly \u201clooks at me through the eyes of\nthe other\u201d (TI: 213). Here too the passage to reason, social\nexistence, and objective time occurs because the temporal lapse called\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d is invariably reabsorbed by intentional\nconsciousness. On this point, Levinas accords Husserl his argument\nthat affects are always on the verge of becoming intentional (Hua 10:\nAppendix 12). The responsibility and fraternity, which are now\nformulated as the unfathomable other-in-the-same, still leave a\ntrace in social relations. And, faithful to his 1961 project, the\ntrace is not framed as metaphysical. It is found, rather, in our\nconcern for restorative justice, even for modest equity. This concern\nfor justice does not erase the Hobbesian or Machiavellian nature of\nhuman drives. In 1974, however, the difficulty of holding together the\npassive temporality (which Levinas likens to ageing, [OBBE: 54])\nwith the flowing time of intentional consciousness and social\nrationality, has become more obvious. Levinas inquires, \u201cDoes a\nface abide in representation and in proximity; is it\ncommunity and difference?\u201d (OBBE: 154, emph. added).\nUndecidable, this is a question for us as well: \n\n\nThe third party introduces a contradiction in the saying whose\nsignification before the other until then went in one direction\n[toward the singular other]. It is of itself the limit of\nresponsibility and the birth of the question: What do I have to do\nwith justice? A question of consciousness. (OBBE: 157)\n\n\nWith the return to a philosophy of consciousness and representation,\nthe indispensable figure of the trace that Levinas has introduced\nbecomes attenuated. As we have seen, to confront eventual skepticism\nabout the trace, he enacts his witness in a literary here and\nnow. His figural performance points not toward another world or to a\nbeing different from that discussed by Heidegger, so much as to the\nintensities and vulnerability of pre-conscious affectivity.\nLevinas\u2019 writing thus appears to come down to a poetics of the\ninexpressible. Nevertheless, since he also demands that we reflect on\nintersubjectivity from a standpoint outside the face-to-face\nencounter, his work gives us a double task: conceptualization\nand the as-if of an enacted here-and-now. Still, justice does\nnot only come down to the question \u201cwhat do I have to do with\njustice?\u201d It entails an additional explanatory move that Levinas\ncannot make. This move would have to account for what the\nother means to the third party, and why third parties insist that\n\u201cI\u201d also receive just treatment. These are questions\nrequiring a systematic perspective, outside the now-moment in which\n\u201cI\u201d emerge and enact my witness, affectively invested by\nalterity (OBBE: 158).\n\nThe equalizing situation from which comparison, justice, and\nnormativity can be deduced is beyond Levinas\u2019 immediate\nconcern. Such a situation is that of objective consciousness. This is,\nfor example, the approach adopted by Hegel in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which he calls the \u201cfor-us\u201d or the\nexternalist standpoint (Hegel 1807 [1977: \u00a725]). Levinas thus\nsimply marks this standpoint, which is for him a conundrum, saying,\n\n\n\n[t]he relationship with the third party is an incessant correction of\nthe asymmetry of proximity in which the face is looked at. There is\nweighing, thought, objectification \u2026 in which my anarchic\nrelationship with illeity [transcendence] is betrayed \u2026 There is\nbetrayal of my anarchic relation with illeity, but also a new\nrelationship with it: it is only thanks to God that, as a\nsubject incomparable with the other, I am approached as an other by\nthe others, that is, \u201cfor myself\u201d. (OBBE: 158, emph.\nadded) \n\n\nWould Levinas\u2019 \u201cthanks to God\u201d then stand in the\nplace of Hegel\u2019s \u201cfor-us\u201d account?\n\nCommentators differ on the interpretation of the phrase \u201cthanks\nto God\u201d. In his subsequent use of the expression, Levinas sets\nthese words between quotation marks. Franck interprets the new concept\nof illeity as denoting the force of proximity and the dignity\nof my investiture by the other. It is the \n\n\nHe [illeity] in whose trace the Thou or the face that intends and\nassigns me signifies \u2026 [But] the He \u2026 does not point toward\nanother world in which the phenomenological and ontological orders\nwould nevertheless prevail \u2026 [Rather, as Levinas says,] \u201cit\nis the \u2026 Infinity of the absolutely other, escaping\nontology\u201d. (Franck 2008: 109, my trans.) \n\n\n\u201cIlleity\u201d thus points to an indeterminate place or source,\nthe sheer dignity of the other who faces me, or the other always\nalready motivating my saying. Yet despite this, Levinas sometimes\nextends illeity to the possibility of my receiving justice\nfrom other people. He writes, \u201cthanks to God\n[Il] \u2026 I am approached as an other by the others\u201d\n(OBBE: 158). But, of course, even if universal justice is\n\u201cthanks to God\u201d, this God is not part of\nbeing (OBBE: 162)\u2014a claim familiar to both negative theology and\nto Maimonides\u2019 ultimate approach to God through human action.\nLevinas is fully aware of the paradox he introduces into\n\u201cilleity\u201d. And he clearly knows the theological reversion\nto praxis that Maimonides proposes at the end of his\nGuide of the Perplexed: \u201cThe only positive knowledge of\nGod of which man is capable is knowledge of the attributes of\naction\u201d \n (Fagenblat 2010: 113).[43]\n As Levinas puts it, \u201cto know God is to know what must be\ndone\u201d (DF: 17). It is not to know some being or even to erect a\nregulative idea. The dignity and force of illeity thus share an\nimportant connection with what we might call our enacting God\nthrough responsibility to the other or through justice. Another word\nfor this is \u201choliness\u201d, whether this comes from me in the\nform of the Saying or from the others as justice toward me.\n\nHere lies the point at which a reading begins that bridges the\nphilosophical and the religious\u2014above all the\nTalmudic\u2014dimensions of Levinas\u2019 thought. Indeed, as he put\nit in his 1966 article \u201cInfinity\u201d (AT: 53\u201376): \n\n\nAn entire strain of contemporary philosophy, setting out from the\nirreducibility of the interpersonal to relations of objectivity,\nthematization, and knowledge, is situated in the religious tradition\nof the idea of the infinite \u2026 even when it expresses itself in a\ndeliberately and rigorously atheistic way. (AT: 76, emph.\nadded)\n\n\nThat suggests that whether we approach it atheistically or\nreligiously, the tension between interpersonal relations and\nobjectivity implies the third party and by extension a social\nrelationality which is indissociable from justice and politics. But it\nis not clear that Levinas ever decided whether politics implied above\nall war or the means toward a peaceable State. In his late essay\n\u201cPeace and Proximity\u201d (1984; col-BPW: 161\u2013169),\nLevinas expressed an attitude surprisingly favorable to the idea of\nthe politics which, when the State is a liberal one, evinces palpable\naspects of the trace of responsibility in its policies. \n\n\nIt is not without importance to know\u2014and this is perhaps the\nEuropean experience of the twentieth century\u2014whether the\negalitarian and just State [and its politics] in which the European is\nfulfilled \u2026 proceeds from a war of all against all\u2014or from\nthe irreducible responsibility of the one for the other. (In Rolland,\ned. 1984, 346, my trans.) \n\n\nOf course, the notion of a just politics has meant different things\naccording to the form the State takes, whether totalitarian,\nauthoritarian, or\n liberal.[44]\n Given his evocations of a pluralist or multilayered existence in\nTotality and Infinity (TI: 19, 80, 306), Levinas\u2019\nargument that justice is marked by the trace of responsibility seems\nto accord relatively well with liberal theories of political justice\nand sovereignty. As is well known, Anglo-American theorists of\nsovereignty and politics emphasize that individuals live in multiple\nsocial associations, which impose a host of responsibilities on them.\nA pluralistic socio-political existence diminishes the emphasis on\nsovereignty as concentrated in the State alone. Be that as it may,\nLevinas\u2019 notion of a trace of responsibility within justice does\nnot explain how other people, not just I, can be said to be ethically\n\u201cinvested\u201d by responsibility. That I receive justice from\nthem thus remains \u201cthanks to God\u201d. Moreover, what is true\nof ethical systems may well be true of political ones. That is,\nfollowing his comprehensive comparison of Levinas\u2019 philosophy\nwith contemporary theories of ethics, Morgan admits: \n\n\nI do not think that Levinas would favor any particular moral\nsystem\u2014say, some form of Kantian morality or of\nconsequentialism, insofar as it is a system. (2007: 456,\nemph. added) \n\n\nThis may be true of any form of political regime as well, because for\nLevinas politics attempts to forge systems\u2014as he says, to\ntotalize (TI: 15, 21, 292\u2013305). We have seen above Rose\u2019s\nneo-Hegelian objection that Levinas\u2019 ethics lacks mediations\nsufficient to have real implications for politics\n (\u00a72.3.4).\n Recently, Salanskis has nevertheless proposed a surprising\n\u201cmediation\u201d, found in Judaism itself, arguing that the\nlatter provides an \u201cidealist horizon liable to interest all\nof humanity\u201d, because it ties this horizon narratively\n\u201cto a practical and intellectual testing\n\u2018laboratory\u2019, that of the life of a people\u201d\n(Salanskis 2016: 129, note 68). This claim suggests that there is a\nproto-political project in Biblical and Talmudic Judaism, though\nSalanskis leaves unexplored the further implications of his\n\u201claboratory\u201d. As to the political implications of the\nTalmud\u2019s pluralism of rabbinic voices, which is part of\nSalanskis\u2019 laboratory, Levinas does at times emphasize the\nimportance of Jewish thought entering into \u201cuniversal\nhistory\u201d, even while promoting responsibility for others and the\nethics of messianic awaiting (DF: 96). For example, in his Talmudic\nreading entitled \u201cMessianic Texts\u201d (1962), he justifies\nthe creation of a Jewish State on the basis of the possibility of\nprotecting both messianic patience and a Talmudic education to\nresponsibility, despite the violence implied by Israel becoming\none State among others, within universal and secular history\n(also see Morgan 2016: 256\u2013265, responding to Kavka 2015).\n\nLet us focus for a moment more directly on this question of justice in\nJewish thought. Insofar as we can speak of one Jewish\nphilosophical tradition, notably a modern one, the question of justice\nforms the core of its approach to the prophetic message. In\nthat respect it would certainly have a political dimension; or, at the\nleast, a social-existential one. It may be that to answer the question\nof the politics (in the minimal sense of State policies) liable to\nemerge from Levinas\u2019 ethics requires that we pay close attention\nto his philosophical anthropology, i.e., to his conception of\nthe human condition or what it means to be a human being. Recently,\nSarah Hammerschlag has returned to Levinas\u2019 captivity notebooks\nin which he jotted his wartime insights into Judaism as he lived it\nthen: \n\n\nJ. [might be compared to] a splinter in the flesh. One might live\nwithout it, but if one didn\u2019t have [this source of suffering],\nmy life [would be deprived] of its acuity \u2026 or fallen back into\ninfancy. (LO1: 172, my trans.) \n\n\nThis conception of a Jewish \u201canthropology\u201d corresponds not\nto particular Jews, but to our human condition when we understand it\nas a condition largely received, passively and without our\nexplicit choice. As Hammerschlag and Fagenblat have urged, this human\npathos, consistent with a pluralistic ontology, might well be\napproached as an existential category (Hammerschlag 2012:\n 389\u2013419).[45]\n This too is why Levinas characterized Judaism as \u201can\nunderstanding of being\u201d, rather than as a religion. Yet this\ncategory may surprise us if we overlook the fact that a definitive\npart of our existence does comes from without, i.e., through the\ninternalization of the life of our community, its founding texts, but\nalso through social and political characterizations of us\n(antisemitism, racism, sexism).\n\nApproached as unbidden passivity, of course, the existential category\ncalled Judaism raises the question of other passive ascriptions and\ntheir implications for the question of what it means to be a\nhuman being. If, by 1974, politics and the third party are largely\nsynonyms for \u201chumanity\u201d for Levinas, then we must conclude\nthat politics has, by extension, become more for him than the conflict\nand strife he described in his preface to Totality and\nInfinity (TI: 21\u201325). Politics would have to take seriously\na pluralistic humanism, as well as the condition of passive\nascriptions including racism. The implication is that one may\nsometimes have a choice, in one\u2019s actions, about whether\npolitics is indeed a war of all against all or the site in which\ntraces of justice toward the other can be demanded. However that may\nbe, some commentators have raised the concern that\n\u201chumanity\u201d for Levinas looks basically like\nHusserl\u2019s rationalist ideal of humanity (Husserl 1954 [1970:\n275], cited by McGettigan 2006: 16). This would be the humanity of\nEurope, and beneath that, one flowing out of the intertwined\nvoices of \u201cAthens\u201d and\n \u201cJerusalem\u201d.[46]\n To be sure, the Biblical prophets demanded justice (and repentance)\nfrom their wayward communities. But political justice requires a\npublic space, an agora in which the agorein (public\nspeaking) gives rise to categories of thought\n(kat\u2019agorein means to accuse publicly).\n\nThis dual preoccupation with justice as rectitude, and justice as\ncivic virtue, seems to suggest that together Athens and Jerusalem give\nus a comprehensive approach to politics, as both practice and ideal.\nDrabinski and Fred Moten have questioned this universality (Drabinski\n2011: 165\u2013196), and with it the category of\n\u201cbeing-Jewish\u201d, in favor of an emphasis on the passivity\nintrinsic to a multiplicity of human situations, including\nrace, ethnicity, and gender. Moreover, as Moten cautions, passivity\ncan be readily observed in our relations to things rather\nthan persons. He thus adds that the Bible and the Greeks, although\noften presented as \u201cthe whole world\u201d, thereby become a\nteleological reflection that expresses an unacknowledged European\nmalaise, wherein the non-European receives the status of a\nmere object (Moten 2018: 9, 11). Attributing this to the transcendence\ntoward-the-world of phenomenological intentionality, which shares some\nof the blind spots of the colonial enterprise, Moten discusses the\nobject-like passivity of being on the receiving end of multiple\nracisms, including Levinas\u2019 own \u201cunintended racism\u201d.\nIf we take his concern seriously, then passivity as a category of\nbeing-human strains against being attributed to Jews alone. In turn,\nthis raises the philosophical-anthropological question of situational\npassivities, the very idea of humanity, and those \u201cbeings\u201d\nthat inhabit worlds unacknowledged by the European tradition (Moten\n2018: 17). While this is a critique of Levinas, Moten also invites us\nto expand the latter\u2019s anthropological category of being-Jewish,\nand to ask ourselves what kind of politics might flow out of such an\n expansion.[47]\n\n2.5 Essays and Interviews after Otherwise than Being: The Tension between Ethics and Justice\n\nSubsequent to Otherwise than Being,Levinas\u2019 works\nreturn to and refine his major themes. These works include\nTranscendence and Intelligibility (1984), In the Time of\nthe Nations (1988), Entre Nous (1991), and Alterity\nand Transcendence (1995), all of which are collections of essays\nfrom various periods between 1951 and 1989. However, the first of\nthese collections to appear, entitled Of God Who Comes to\nMind (1982), contains the important essay \u201cGod and\nPhilosophy\u201d (1975; OGCM: 55\u201378), which is a critical\nconfrontation with the God of Descartes and Malebranche, and a subtle\ndebate with Heidegger. This essay is followed by the transcript of a\ntwo-hour discussion with professors from the University of Leyden\n(OGCM: 79\u201399), in which social problems infrequently addressed\nby Levinas are\n raised.[48]\n Despite the wide temporal gamut run by these publications, we find\nfew new developments, other than a clearer resolve to address the\nambiguity intrinsic to the signifier \u201cGod\u201d (OGCM:\n\u00a7\u00a710\u201313, 17\u201319), and the verbal dynamics of\nbeing (corresponding to Heidegger\u2019s Wesen), henceforth\ncharacterized by Levinas\u2019 neologism\n\u201cessance\u201d (OGCM: 43\u201351).\n\nHowever, Franck has detected a profound divergence in these new\ndevelopments. In a highly sophisticated reading of the essays and\ninterviews written or given after Otherwise than Being, he\nnotes that the tension between the two aforementioned conceptions of\njustice (that of 1961 and that of 1974) has come to look like an\nepistemological inconsistency. This inconsistency is due to\nLevinas\u2019 later choice to hold justice and (empirical) social\nlife at a significant distance from each other. Indeed, by\nprogressively aligning justice with transcendence, Levinas runs into\nan important difficulty after 1974. That is, either justice belongs to\nresponsibility from the outset (1961), whereupon the \u201cthird\nparty\u201d refers simply to the tendency of intentional\nconsciousness to reconnect any sensuous gaps in itself, or\nresponsibility and transcendence firstly require justice in\norder to be pondered and communicated. In other words, for Franck,\neither justice and responsibility are co-originary, in which case\nresponsibility cannot leave a trace in justice and being, or\nresponsibility itself presupposes justice, a constituted\nworld, and linguistic concepts. In the first case, that of aligning\nresponsibility and justice, the third party would simply denote\neveryday consciousness (TI). In the second case, justice would in fact\ngravitate toward illeity, the \u201cHe-ness\u201d of the absent God\n(OBBE and after). Once again, in the first case and in terms of lived\ntime, the third party is indeed largely simultaneous with the other,\ngiven our social life and context. As Franck explains, we clearly live\nin society and any phenomenological description must operate\nwithin reflection, which is also the domain called the third party.\nBut in the second case, if we hold the third party close to illeity,\nthen the question why I receive justice \u201cfor\nmyself\u201d from others can only be answered\nquasi-theologically, as \u201cthanks to God\u201d. Yet this second\noption shifts our attention from justice within social life toward the\nenigma posed by the fact that I do receive justice from\nothers thanks to some near-miraculous concern of theirs for me. But\nthen, should justice for all refer to our social and legal contexts or\nrather to an absolute called illeity? Mobilizing extensive arguments,\nFranck shows that this difficulty comes into a crude light in the late\nworks. And indeed, if the later Levinas chooses to hold these two\nconceptions together, then justice is both social and in some sense\ndivine, like a godly justice or a theopolitics (Franck 2008: 239). If\nit is the latter, then Levinas\u2019 hermeneutics of an ethical\n\u201cotherwise than being\u201d just amounts to an abstraction\nrooted essentially in theology. \n\nAs if anticipating Franck\u2019s strong, structural critique, Levinas\nstaked out a surprising claim for the social simultaneity of the other\nand the third party in a 1982 interview entitled \u201cPhilosophy,\nJustice, and Love\u201d (EN: 103\u2013122). He there argues, \n\n\nI do not live in a world where there is but one \u2018first\ncome\u2019. There is always a third [party] in the world; he too\nis my other, my neighbor. Consequently, it matters to me to know\nwhich of the two passes first: is the one not the persecutor of the\nother? Must men, [although understood] as incomparable, not be\ncompared? Justice is thus prior here to taking the\nother\u2019s fortunes upon oneself. (EN: 103\u2013104, emph. added)\n\n\n\nThe supposed priority of the other would thus depend on one\u2019s\napproach, which can be ethical or socio-juridical. Indeed, the problem\nof priority is further complicated by the fact that, as early as 1974,\nLevinas cited Isaiah 57:19, deliberately inverting the order of the\nterms, \u201cneighbor\u201d and \u201cthe one far away\u201d. He\nthus writes, \u201cPeace to the neighbor and to the distant\none\u201d (OBBE: 157). Eleven years later, he corrects his citation\nin an interview entitled \u201cOn Jewish Philosophy\u201d (1985;\nITN: 167\u2013183): \u201c\u2018Peace, peace, to him that is far\noff and to him that is near\u2019, says the Eternal\u201d. And he\nadds, \n\n\nOutside the one who is near \u2026 he who is far off compels\nrecognition. Outside the other there is the third party. He is\nalso an other, also a neighbor. But which is the closest\nproximity? [\u2026] There must be knowledge of such things! (ITN:\n172, emph. added)\n\n\nAs a critical reader of Levinas, Franck appears to be the only\ncommentator who has raised Levinas\u2019 later remarks to the status\nof epistemological inconsistency. Franck argues cogently that if we\nmust be able to determine whether the third party is also an other, or\na persecutor of others, or a criminal, then justice must\nprecede responsibility, rather than the reverse. That is,\nrather than responsibility grounding justice thanks to the trace it\nleaves within justice, the latter must have priority (2008,\n240\u2013242). Franck\u2019s objection has important implications\nfor the relationship between ethics and politics in Levinas. We live\nin human society, and we cannot escape that, he says. But does this\nnot imply that it is impossible to set justice decisively outside\npolitics, and as if outside ontology, as Levinas\u2019 later work\nseems to do? That also means that we can never separate the sincerity\nthat Levinas calls \u201cthe Saying\u201d (or le dire) from\nthe very words (le dit) that express and describe it. We\ntherefore need words, and intentionality, to make what Levinas\ncharacterized as the pre-thematic into a theme (OBBE: 99). We even\nneed words to stabilize the affect called sincerity or the Saying.\nFailing words, sincerity and with it proximity are simply\nabstractions, philosophical constructions. There is nothing wrong\nper se with such philosophical constructs, if that is what\nthese concepts are. It is illegitimate, however, to argue that they\nprecede intentional consciousness and even reflection.\n\nNow, given Otherwise than Being\u2019s\nrapprochement between the third party and illeity, must the\nthird party not admit two distinct, even irreconcilable senses? The\n1961 sense would still refer to social existence and the moderation of\nresponsibility, while the 1974 sense would henceforth point to a\nradically absent Il, also called \u201cGod\u201d. This too\nhas consequences for the question of justice\u2014i.e., whether it is\nprimary to Levinas\u2019 existential ethics, or secondary and largely\nderivative from responsibility. As we know, the Jewish tradition, and\nothers as well, holds the judge responsible for fair decisions; this\nspecialist of laws is also a member of the community and must obey the\nLaw he adjudicates. This is more than simply a platitude; the\njudge\u2019s dual status casts light on the competing priorities of\nresponsibility versus justice. To explain his positions Levinas recurs\nto Psalm 82: \u201cGod stands in the divine assembly, among the\ndivine beings. He pronounces judgment\u201d. In other words, only if\nilleity refers to a transcendent absolute, viz., \u201cGod in the\ndivine assembly\u201d, can the third party (understood as the others\nor society) be raised above an everyday social function and confer on\njustice something like a regulative idea able to preserve a trace of\ntranscendence.\n\nLevinas\u2019 reference to Psalm 82 is less surprising than we might\nsuppose. Echoing Carl Schmitt\u2019s Political Theology,\nFagenblat points out, firstly, that all the important concepts in\nmodern statehood theory are secularized religious ideas. But,\nsecondly, the secularization process does not stop with statehood\ntheory, \u201ca similar phenomenon applies to secular moral\nconcepts\u201d (Fagenblat 2010: xi, emph. added). \nIn short, \u201cGod\u201d\nis the crucial name for an absolute, indispensable to justice\nunderstood as an ongoing project. To be sure, for Franck, the\nreference to a \u201cGod\u201d who judges is less a problem of\nsecularization than a reason why it is impossible to argue\nfor the priority of responsibility over justice. And this is\ntrue whether the priority is defined as ontological or\npractical. But Franck fails to acknowledge that Levinas is aware of\nthis tension. In \u201cPhilosophy, Justice, and Love\u201d, Levinas\ndraws a complex portrait of the third party as \u201cGod\u201d based\non a new, and crucial, distinction between the meaning of\n\u201cGod\u201d as Elohim and \u201cGod\u201d as the\nTetragrammaton (YHWH; EN:\n 108).[49]\n In the rabbinic tradition, Elohim, God of justice, first\ncreated the world. That world did not survive by itself; that is,\nwithout the \u201csupplement\u201d provided by YHWH, the God of\nmercy. Hence, the necessity of a second creation where justice was\nmore than equal treatment.\n\nGiven the mythic alignment of Elohim with justice, and YHWH\nwith mercifulness, Levinas argues that illeity has two\npossible modalizations: justice or equity; mercy or compassion. The\npriority of one God thus depends on the perspective we adopt: justice\nwould belong to ontology, compassion to an ethical perspective. For\nFagenblat, the ethical priority emerges as the possibility of creating\nand safeguarding meaning\u2014by extension, as creation tout\ncourt (2010: 44\u201353). \nThat is, in Biblical symbolism, when read in the\nrabbinic tradition, a world created first on justice (as equality and\ncomparison) does not survive, because demands for equality (and with\nthem, for blind justice) are unceasing and do not admit an outside or\ntranscendent term allowing for considerations beyond bilateral\ncomparison. It is the transcendent term, the outside as it were, that\nmotivates justice to strive asymptotically towards an idea. That is\nwhy Levinas observes that being human implies that we are certainly\nborn into a social world, a world of many others and third parties.\nBut we are sustained, and individuated, by mercy. Moreover, mercy\nrepresents, for justice, the trace of responsibility. This becomes\nclear only when one reads Levinas\u2019 philosophy together with his\nTalmudic texts.\n\nFor this and other reasons, the all-important question of the priority\nof responsibility as against justice must be approached as a complex\none, in part dependent on lived circumstances. From the\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d perspective that Levinas defined as desire\nfor the other in Totality and Infinity (TI: 39),\nresponsibility and proximity come first (EN: 107\u2013108). From the\nperspective of practice and our living-in-society, justice stands\ncloser to ethics and may sometimes precede it. G\u00e9rard Bensussan\nhas pondered this question in light of the Christian tradition in the\nWest, for which Judaism already represents an alterity\u2014in text\nand in act; for example, when the Passover seder re-enacts the escape\nfrom enslavement in Egypt, it ritually recalls: \u201cstrangers we\nwere, and thus, strangers we are\u201d, even now (Bensussan\n2008: 78). A more rigorously philosophical reckoning may require that\nthe relationship between the two perspectives, justice and mercy, be\nfurther clarified. Be that as it may, this is one point on which the\nJewish writings of Levinas enrich, even ground, his philosophical\narguments.\n3. Concluding Remarks\n\nCommentators have differed on the comparative importance of\nLevinas\u2019 major works, Totality and Infinity and\nOtherwise than Being. Some have urged that we see in them two\nsides of a single coin: that of responsibility experienced in the\nface-to-face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective\ntrace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical\nphenomenology (Peperzak 1993: 7). Other commentators have argued that\nOtherwise than Being is Levinas\u2019 magnum\n opus,[50]\n a study on the intersubjective pre-conditions of language indebted\nto, yet diverging from, Heidegger\u2019s investigations of the poetic\nlogos (in which man dwells and being is intimated; Heidegger\nhe-EHP: 59\u201364). As we have seen, Derrida called Totality and\nInfinity a \u201ctreatise on hospitality\u201d (see\n \u00a72.4.1 above)\n and devoted, in sum, more attention to it than to Otherwise than\nBeing, although the latter work was in part a response to\nDerrida\u2019s criticisms in \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d\n(Derrida 1964 [1978]). There is little question that the novelty of\nOtherwise than Being lies in its three innovations: (1) the\nanalyses and tropes for transcendence-in-immanence (recurrence,\nproximity, obsession, persecution, and substitution); (2) the\ndeconstruction of language understood as the site in which existence\nis said and explained, and (3) Levinas\u2019 \u201cwager\u201d of\nstepping out of philosophical reasoning into a performative register\nthat both \u201csays\u201d and \u201cunsays\u201d itself by turns\n(OBBE: 167).\n\nDespite these innovations, Levinas\u2019 philosophical project\nremains largely constant: to rethink the meaning of existence in\nterms of the ethical transcendence of the other. To that end, he\nconsistently revisited Husserl\u2019s phenomenological method. He\nreconceived Heidegger\u2019s ontological difference as an irreducible\nseparation between being and the good we enact. He had extensive,\noften undeclared recourse to the profound, anti-totalizing intuitions\nof religious life found in Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s new thinking. By\nreason of his opposition to systems-thought, Levinas never adhered\nuncritically to any one philosophy. \n\nA common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings.\nTranscendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of\nresponsibility for another person. Responsibility is experienced in\nconcrete life and is variously expressed, from words like \u201chere\nI am\u201d to apologies and self-accounting. This is the case,\nLevinas argues, even before a de facto command is heard or\nreflected on. This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated\nmeaning of Jews \u201creceiving the Torah before knowing what was\nwritten in it\u201d (NTR: 42\u201343). Levinas names this\nresponsiveness Platonically the \u201cGood beyond being\u201d. We\nperform that good, that trace of the infinite, because\ninstances of answering to or for another are everyday events, though\nthey may not appear typical of natural or self-interested behaviors.\nAbove all, we do not choose to be responsible. Responsibility\narises as if elicited, before we begin to think about it, by the\napproach of the other person. Because this theme is found in his\nphilosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages,\nLevinas\u2019 thought has, at times, left both Talmud scholars and\nphilosophers dissatisfied. For some Talmudists, his thought seems\nsecularly humanistic, with \u201cinfinity\u201d suggesting a\nclandestine concept of divinity. No stranger to Mishna and Gemara\n(Talmud), his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional\ninter- and intra-textuality, than with the ethical content of\nthe teachings therein. To philosophers skeptical of him,\nLevinas\u2019 thought reinterprets Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutic\ncircle of facticity in a metaphysical vein. Indeed, its\nanti-foundationalist approach to responsibility, as the pre-reflective\nstructure of the embodied, intersubjective \u201cself\u201d\n(soi), appears to these critics to lie between phenomenology\nand religious thought, even if it lacks specific dogmatic commitments.\nAs we have seen, in his later philosophy, the seemingly metaphysical\nconcept of illeity expresses my emotive experience of a\n\u201cpower\u201d or an affective excess greater than I can contain.\nIn this way, it also resembles Descartes\u2019 \u201clight so\nresplendent\u201d (Descartes 1641 [1911], Meditation V). But\nit is precisely in these tensions, between the Jewish religious and\nphilosophical traditions, on the one hand, and his\nphenomenological-existential thinking-of-the-other, on the other hand,\nthat Levinas\u2019 originality lies.",
