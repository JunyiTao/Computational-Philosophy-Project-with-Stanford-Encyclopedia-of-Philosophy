    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Justice: Constructive Phase\n7.4 Justice: Constructive Phase\n\nHume rightly showcases his pioneering account of justice. In the\nTreatise, he emphasizes the distinction between the natural\nand artificial virtues. The natural virtues\u2014being humane, kind,\nand charitable\u2014are character traits and patterns of behavior\nthat human beings would exhibit in their natural condition, even if\nthere were no social order. The artificial virtues\u2014respecting\npeople\u2019s property rights, fidelity in keeping promises and\ncontracts, and allegiance to government\u2014are dispositions based\non social practices and institutions that arise from conventions.\n\nHume believes that nature has supplied us with many\nmotives\u2014parental love, benevolence, and generosity\u2014that\nmake it possible for us to live together peacefully in small societies\nbased on kinship relations. One of his important insights is that\nnature has not provided us with all the motives we need to live\ntogether peacefully in large societies. After arguing in\nTreatise 3.2.1 that justice is artificial, in T 3.2.2, he\nasks two different questions: What motivates human beings to establish\nthe rules of justice that give rise to property rights, and why do we\napprove of people who obey these rules of justice? The first question\nconcerns justice as a practice constituted by its rules. The second\nconcerns justice as a virtue, a person\u2019s disposition to obey the\nrules of justice.\n\nHume argues that we enter into a series of conventions to bring about\npractices, each of which is a solution to a problem. Each convention\ngives rise to new problems that in turn pressure us to enter into\nfurther conventions. The convention to bring about property rights is\nonly the first of several into which we enter. After property rights\nare established, we enter into conventions to transfer property and to\nmake promises and contracts. According to him, we are by nature\ncooperators, although at first we cooperate only with members of our\nown family. But it is also advantageous for us to cooperate with\nstrangers, since it allows us to produce more goods and to exchange\nthem. All three conventions are prior to the formation of government.\nOn Hume\u2019s view, it is possible for there to be a peaceful\nsociety of property owners who transfer and exchange material\npossessions before there is government.\n\nHume argues that the practice of justice is a solution to a problem we\nnaturally face. The problem is that since we care most about our\nfamily and close friends, but material goods are scarce and portable,\nwe are tempted to take goods from strangers to give to our family and\nfriends. Disputes over these goods are inevitable, but if we quarrel\nwe will forfeit the benefits that result from living together in\nsociety\u2014increased power, ability, and security. The solution to\nthe problem is to establish property rights. We make rules that\nspecify who has a right to what, and agree to follow the rules and to\nkeep our hands off the property of others. Hume was one of the first\nto see that what is useful is the practice of justice, rather than\nindividual acts of justice. Like Hobbes, he believes that it is in our\ninterest to have the practice of justice in place.\n\nAs we just saw, Hume parts company with Hobbes when he answers the\nsecond question about why we approve of people who obey the rules of\njustice. If Hobbes\u2019 answer in terms of self-interest is\nexcluded, he thinks only one possibility remains. We approve of just\npeople not because they benefit us but because we sympathize with the\nbenefits they bestow on others and society as a whole. Hume thus\nexplains our approval of justice by appealing to the same principle he\ninvoked to explain our approval of the natural virtues. Thus\n\nself-interest is the original motive to the establishment\nof justice: but a sympathy with public interest is the source of\nthe moral approbation, which attends that virtue. (T\n3.2.2.24/499\u2013500)\n\n\nIn Part 2 of the \u201cConclusion\u201d of the Enquiry,\nHume raises a serious problem with his account of justice. While it is\nin our interest to have the practice of justice in place, it may not\nalways be in our interest to obey its rules in every case. This is the\nfree rider problem. The free rider, whom Hume calls the sensible\nknave, wants to get the benefits that result from having a practice in\nplace without having to always follow its rules. He knows that the\nonly way to obtain the advantages of social cooperation is for the\npractice of justice to be in place, but he also realizes that a single\nact of injustice will not significantly damage the practice. Most\npeople will obey the rules of justice, so if he commits one act of\ninjustice, the institution will not be in any danger of collapsing.\nSuppose he has the opportunity to commit an act of injustice that will\nbenefit him greatly. Why shouldn\u2019t he?\n\nHume confesses that if the sensible knave expects an answer, he is not\nsure there is one that will convince him.\n\n\nIf his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims, if he feel no\nreluctance to thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a\nconsiderable motive to virtue\u2026. (EPM 9.2.23/283)\n\n\nThere is no general agreement about whether Hume actually provides an\nanswer to the sensible knave and if he does, whether it is\nadequate.\n",
