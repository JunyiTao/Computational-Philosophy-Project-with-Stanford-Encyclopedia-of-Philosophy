Experimentation, Rationality and Social Epistemology\n\nAs the preceding sections should have made clear, there is ample\nevidence that biological research does not fit a Popperian image of\nscience according to which \u201cThe theoretician puts certain\ndefinite questions to the experimenter, and the latter, by his\nexperiments, tries to elicit a decisive answer to these questions, and\nto no others. All other questions he tries hard to exclude\u201d\n(Popper 1959, 107). According to Rheinberger, much experimental\nresearch in biology does not aim at testing pre-conceived theories.\nHowever, sometimes theories or theoretical frameworks are, in fact,\nadopted by the scientific community, while others are abandoned. Even\nif it is true that most research is not aimed at testing theories,\nresearch can still undermine some theoretical ideas and support\nothers, to the point that one framework is chosen while another is\nrejected. How are such choices made? What principles guide them? And\ndo the choices actually exhibit some kind of epistemic rationality, as\nmost philosophers of science think, or do they merely reflect the\ninterests or larger cultural changes in society, as many sociologists\nand historians of science think?\n\nQuestions such as these are notoriously difficult to answer. Those who\nprefer a rational view of scientific change must demonstrate that\ntheir preferred epistemic norms actually inform the choices made by\nscientists. This has proven to be difficult. If we re-consider our\ncase from Section 3, the oxidative phosphorylation controversy, there\nexists a sociological account (Gilbert and Mulkay 1984) as well as\ndifferent philosophical accounts that do not even agree in how to\nexplain scientific change (Allchin 1992, 1994, 1996; Weber 2005, Ch.\n4\u20135).\n\nBy the same token, those who think that scientific change is\nhistorically contingent, in theory, must be able to justify historical\ncounterfactuals of the form \u201chad the social/cultural context at\nsome given time been different, scientists would have adopted other\ntheories (or other experimental systems, model organisms, etc)\u201d.\nIt is controversial whether such claims are justifiable (see Radick\n2005 for a recent attempt).\n\nPerhaps there is a way of reconciling the two perspectives. In recent\nyears, a new kind of epistemology has emerged that sees no\ncontradiction in viewing science both as a profoundly social activity\nand at the same time as rational. This, of course, is social\nepistemology (e.g., Goldman 1999; Longino 2002; Solomon 2001). Social\nepistemologists try to show that social interactions in scientific\ngroups or communities can give rise to a practice that is rational,\nalthough perhaps not in exactly the same way as epistemological\nindividualists have imagined it.\n\nCould there be a social account of scientific change for experimental\nbiology? Of course, such an account should not fall back into a\ntheory-first view of science but rather view theories as embedded in\nsome practice. To see how this is possible, it\u2019s best to consider the\ncase of classical genetics.\n\nClassical genetics is said to derive from Mendel\u2019s experiments with\npea plants, however, the story is more complex than this. At the\nbeginning of the 20th Century, there existed several\nschools in genetics, on both sides of the Atlantic. In England, the\nBiometric school of Karl Pearson and Raphael Weldon were developing a\nquantitative approach that took Francis Galton \u201cLaw of ancestral\nheredity\u201d as its point of departure. The Mendelian William\nBateson was leading a rival movement. In the United States, Thomas\nHunt Morgan and his associates were constructing the first genetic\nmaps of the fruit fly. For a while, William Castle was defending a\ndifferent approach to genetic mapping, as well as a different theory\nof the gene. Various approaches were also developed in Continental\nEurope, for example, in the Netherlands (Hugo de Vries), Germany (Carl\nCorrens) or Austria (Erich Tschermak). The American school of Thomas\nHunt Morgan pretty much carried the day. Its approach to mapping genes\nas well the (ever changing) theory of the gene became widely accepted\nin the 1930s, and became officially incorporated in the Evolutionary\nSynthesis of the 1930s and 40s (Mayr 1982; Provine 1971).\n\nA traditional way for a philosopher of science of looking at this case\nwould be to consider the salient theories and to ask: What\nevidence compelled scientists to adopt Morgan\u2019s theory? However, this\nmay not be the right question to ask. For this question makes the\nsilent supposition that theories and experimental evidence can be\nseparated from each other in genetics. But it can be argued that the\ntwo depend too strongly on each other to be considered separate\nentities. Classical genetics\u2014in all its forms\u2014was first\nand foremost a way of doing crossing experiments with various model\norganisms, and to arrange the results of these experiments in a\ncertain way, for example, linear genetic maps. To be sure, there were\nalso certain ideas about the nature of the gene, some of which highly\nspeculative, others well established by experiments (for example, the\nlinear arrangement on the chromosome, see Weber 1998b). But what is\nsometimes referred to as \u201cthe laws of transmission\ngenetics\u201d or simply \u201cMendel\u00b4s laws\u201d was part\nand parcel of a certain way of doing genetics. Thus, theory is not\nseparable from experimental practice (Waters 2008). This, of course,\ncuts both ways: Experimental data in genetics are as\n\u201ctheory-laden\u201d as they are in other sciences, in other\nwords, the analysis and interpretation of experimental data require\ntheories.\n\nFor our current issue of scientific change, what this means is that\ntheory and experimental evidence were selected together, not\nthe former on the basis of the latter (as a naive empiricist account\nwould have it).\n\nOn what grounds was this selection made? And who made it? A simple,\nbut perhaps incomplete explanation is that the Morgan approach to\ngenetics was selected because it was the most fruitful. A skilled\ngeneticist who adopted the Morgan way was almost guaranteed to come up\nwith publishable results, mostly in the form of genetic maps, and\nperhaps also some interesting observations such as mutations that\nbehaved oddly in genetic crosses. By contrast, the alternative\napproaches that were still around in the early 20th Century\ndid not prove to be as fruitful. That is, they did not produce a\ncomparable number of results that could be deemed a success according\nto these sciences\u2019 own standards. What is more, the\nalternative genetic approaches were not adaptable to other scientific\ndisciplines such as evolutionary biology. Classical genetics thus\nout-competed the other approaches by its sheer productivity, which was\nmanifested by published research papers, successful grant\napplications, successful students, and so on. It was therefore the\nscientific community as a whole that selected the new genetics due to\nits fruitfulness. At no point was there any weighing of evidence for\nor against the theoretical framework in question on the part of\nindividual scientists, or at least this played no role (of course,\nthere was weighing of evidence for more specific claims made within\nthe same framework). Theories in experimental biology are thus\nselected as parts of experimental practices (or experimental systems,\nsee\n \u00a74.2),\n and always at the community level. This is how a social\nepistemological account of scientific change in experimental biology\nmight look like (Weber 2011).\n\nThe image of the rise of classical genetics just drawn is reminiscent\nof Thomas Kuhn\u2019s philosophy of science (Kuhn 1970), or of David Hull\u2019s\naccount of the rise of cladistic taxonomy (Hull 1988). It is a\ncontroversial issue whether such an image is compatible with a broadly\nrational construal of scientific practice. Kuhn thought that there\nexists no external standard of rationality that we could appeal to in\norder to answer this question, but he also held that science is the\nvery epitome of rationality (Kuhn 1971, 143f.). According to Kuhn,\nthere is an emergent social rationality inherent in modern science\nthat cannot be construed as the exercise of individual rational\nfaculties. Hull (1988) seems to be taking a similar view.\n",
