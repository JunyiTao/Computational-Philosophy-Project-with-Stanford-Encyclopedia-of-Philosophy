    "main_text": "Some important conceptions\n8. Why the differences?\n\nThe nuances of these different theories are closely related to the\nmarkedly different interests of the schools within which they\ndeveloped. Sanskrit poetics was interested in the poetic dimensions of\nmeaning. Grammarians were interested in language and cognition, but\nhad little interest in ontological categories per se, except as\nconceptual structures revealed by the usage of words. For them words\nand meanings had to be explained irrespective of one\u2019s metaphysical\nviews. Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas were primarily into\nlogic, epistemology, and ontology, and argued that a valid sentence\nwas a true picture of a state of reality. The foremost goal of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 was to interpret and defend the\nVedic scriptures. Thus, meaning for\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 had to be eternal, uncreated,\nand unrelated to the intention of a person, because its word par\nexcellence, the Vedic scripture, was eternal, uncreated, and beyond\nthe authorship of a divine or human person. The scriptural word was\nthere to instruct people on how to perform proper ritual and moral\nduties, but there was no intention behind it. The Buddhists, on the\nother hand, aimed at weaning people away from all attachment to the\nworld, and hence at showing the emptiness of everything, including\nlanguage. They were more interested in demonstrating how language\nfails to portray reality, than in explaining how it works. The\ntheories of meaning were thus a significant part of the total agenda\nof each school and need to be understood in their specific\ncontext.\n",
