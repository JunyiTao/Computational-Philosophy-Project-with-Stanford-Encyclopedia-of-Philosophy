    "main_text": "Critical Methods || Current Challenges\n2.5 Current Challenges\n\nExponents of genealogical critique and struggle-centered approaches\nproblematize forms of immanent or reconstructive critique that take\ninstitutional achievements as their starting point, challenging them\nby excavating the histories of domination and repression, as well as\nstruggles, that have constituted these institutions and continue to\nshape their functioning. This gives rise to numerous challenges that\ncontinue to animate methodological debates in critical theory: (1) how\n(or even whether) to defend the putative normative achievements of\nliberal democracies, and if those are to be defended as achievements,\nthen (2) how to theorize about the relation between struggles, crises,\nand institutional achievements, in contexts that may involve either\n(3) an absence of struggles, or (4), the opposite problem, a\nproliferation and fragmentation of struggles:\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of genealogical and post-colonial critique, the\ncommitment to the institutions of the modern liberal nation-state\n(Habermas 1992, Honneth 2011) relies on an idealizing view of the\nhistory and present of this political formation that ignores, or\ntreats as historically contingent and philosophically inconsequential,\nthe forms of domination and exclusion that have accompanied it. At a\ntime when the putative institutional achievements of liberal\ndemocracies \u2013 such as the separation of powers, the independence\nof the judiciary, the integrity of elections, or the protection of\nfundamental rights, especially for minorities \u2013 have come under\nattack from right-wing and neo-authoritarian movements and\ngovernments, the question is how critical theorists can defend the\nnormative achievements of the existing order despite its systemic\nshortcomings. Offering a more radical challenge, some critical race\ntheorists and post-colonial critics argue that those shortcomings\nreveal that what were thought to be normative achievements were\nhistorically premised on, and continue to functionally presuppose,\ndomination and exclusion both at a societal and global level (see\n \u00a74.1.2\n and\n \u00a74.1.3\n below). On a methodological level, this involves the challenge of\nrevising or going beyond the normative and sociological categories of\ncritical theory that seem, at least in part, to be tied to a\nspecifically Western experience. \n\n\nMany critical theorists who accept the claim that these are normative\nachievements insist that a more complex view of the relation between\ninstitutions, struggles, and crises is necessary. As mentioned above,\nan alternative strand within critical theory that reaches from Negt\nand Kluge\u2019s recovery of proletarian counterpublics through\nFraser\u2019s theorization of feminist movements to current attempts\nto reconnect critical theory with the struggles of our age, has\ninsisted that abstracting from collective movements and struggles and\nrelocating the emancipatory potential in the normative achievements of\nthe existing institutional order risks underestimating how\ninstitutional dynamics, the inherent crisis tendencies of (more or\nless) liberal democracies, and social struggles are inextricably\nintertwined. Beyond a merely historical and social-theoretical point,\nhow this question is answered will also affect how to conceptualize\nthe role of emancipatory as opposed to regressive struggles in the\nface of the new authoritarianism (see\n \u00a74.2.3\n below). \n\n\nMore abstractly, critical theorists must account for situations in\nwhich there seem to be no struggles or forms of critical consciousness\nto latch onto, or only highly constrained forms of them. How can a\ncritical theory respond to a situation in which domination is more or\nless total and has managed to suppress any critical consciousness and\npractice? Some of Marcuse\u2019s descriptions of contemporary society\ncome closest to this scenario. One might respond that \u201ca society\nof happy slaves, genuinely content with their chains,\u201d a society\nin which domination is experienced not as domination but as freedom,\nmight be the critical theorists\u2019 nightmare, but it \u201cis a\nnightmare, not a realistic view of a state of society which is at\npresent possible\u201d (Geuss 1981, 83\u201384). Nevertheless, the\nchallenge points to a dilemma critical theorists need to navigate. On\nthe one hand, a critical theory requires a starting point in the forms\nof consciousness, experience, and practice of its addressees, but, on\nthe other hand, critical theory should respond to and address\ndistortions and blockages of precisely these forms of consciousness,\nexperience, and practice. While these distortions and blockages will\nin most cases turn out to be partial rather than total and thus allow\nfor some form of problematization to emerge (Celikates 2009, Part\nIII), it seems equally important to not simply tie a critical theory\nto already existing social movements and thus to \u201cgoals that\nhave already been publicly articulated\u201d since this\n\u201cneglects the everyday, still unthematized, but no less pressing\nembryonic form of social misery and moral injustice\u201d (Honneth\n2003, 114; see also Renault 2004, 2008). \n\n\nThe opposite problem can arise when critical theorists diagnose a\nproliferation of social struggles and lines of conflict beyond the\nclassic antagonism of labor and capital. After the demise of the kind\nof philosophy of history that identified the proletariat as the\nrevolutionary subject and the workers\u2019 movement as the\nemancipatory force to which critical theory could and should attach\nitself, it has become unclear how critical theorists can determine\nwith which of the different emancipatory movements of their day to\nenter into the kind of alliance envisaged by Marx and Horkheimer and\nwhich \u201cforms of existing social critique\u201d or\n\u201cexperiences of injustice\u201d to pick up on. This difficulty\nis not only due to the plurality \u2013 or intersectionality \u2013\nof movements, practices of critique, and experiences of injustice, but\nalso due to the fact that struggles are often far from perfectly\naligned and can operate at cross-purposes, with regard to both their\naims and their methods. In answering this challenge, critical\ntheorists can neither simply deduce the \u201ccorrect\u201d struggle\nfrom some overarching laws of historical development (the pole of\ndeterminism), nor claim that theorists simply have to decide which\nstruggle or movement to link their theory to (the pole of\nvoluntarism). \n\n\nInsofar as critical theory is committed to immanent critique, focusing\non the internal contradictions and crises of a specific social order\nand the struggles and movements that arise from within it, these\nchallenges cannot be easily resolved. Rather than seeking to resolve\nthem at an abstract level, they could instead be viewed as opening up\na field of tensions that critical theorists need to navigate within\nthe specific constellation they find themselves in. While critical\ntheory needs to be anchored in actually existing forms of theoretical\nas well as practical critique, in the social struggles that people\nactually engage in, it also has the task of articulating the\nexperiences of those who are blocked from engaging in struggles of\ntheir own and of contributing to the further theoretical articulation\nof existing struggles. At times, critical theory may need \u201cto\npush beyond the \u2018subjective\u2019 elements of struggle and\nlanguages of claims-making to the more \u2018objective\u2019\ndimensions of contradictions and crises, which turn more on the\ndynamics of systemic elements operating independently of whether or\nnot people actually thematize them via struggle\u201d (Fraser and\nJaeggi 2018, 11), without losing sight of the epistemic and political\nrisks this involves.\n\nIn addressing these risks, one way forward has been to embrace\nmethodological pluralism and to understand critical theory less as a\ncomprehensive social theory and more as a critical practice, as\nsomething critics do (Bohman 2003, Kompridis 2006, Celikates 2019a).\nThis approach can more systematically incorporate alternative\nstandpoints and epistemologies and the practices of epistemic\nresistance they are tied to, and more easily build on other traditions\nand paradigms of critical theory, such as feminist, anti-colonial, and\nanti-racist struggles and theorizing (Mills 1988, Collins 1990, 2019,\nMedina 2013, Loick 2021, Celikates 2022; see\n Section 4.1\n below). Anchoring the perspective of critical theory within the\nsocial struggles and epistemic standpoints of the oppressed can serve\nas a counterweight \u2013 in the sense of \u201creflexive\naccountability\u201d (Collins 2019) \u2013 to the tendency of\nactually existing critical theories to set in motion a disempowering\nspiral of epistemic asymmetries that denies the existence of\ntheoretically sophisticated practices of critique and resistance on\nthe ground and thereby reproduces existing obstacles to equal\nparticipation in knowledge production and to radical social\ntransformation. On this view, critical theorizing is itself a social\npractice that recognizes its addressees as equal partners in a\ndialogical struggle for appropriate interpretations and realization of\ntransformative potentials that is informed by social theory and\nsociological research. As such, it can make use of a variety of\ncritical methods \u2013 reconstructive, constructive, disclosive, or\ngenealogical (Freyenhagen 2018) \u2013 that are not easily subsumed\nunder one unified metatheoretical framework, even if they can be seen\nas various attempts to spell out the idea of a critical theory as\nself-reflexive, interdisciplinary, materialist, and emancipatory.\n",
