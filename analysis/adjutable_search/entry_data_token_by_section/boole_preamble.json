    "main_text": "\n\n\nGeorge Boole (1815\u20131864) was an English mathematician and a\nfounder of the algebraic tradition in logic. He worked as a\nschoolmaster in England and from 1849 until his death as professor of\nmathematics at Queen\u2019s University, Cork, Ireland. He\nrevolutionized logic by applying methods from the then-emerging field\nof symbolic algebra to logic. Where traditional (Aristotelian) logic\nrelied on cataloging the valid syllogisms of various simple forms,\nBoole\u2019s method provided general algorithms in an algebraic\nlanguage which applied to an infinite variety of arguments of\narbitrary complexity. These results appeared in two major works,\nThe Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) and The Laws of\nThought (1854).\n",
