But the strong connection between\nargumentative activities and emotional responses has also long been\nrecognized (in particular in rhetorical analyses of argumentation),\nand more recently has become the object of extensive research (Walton\n1992; Gilbert 2004; Hample 2006: ch. 5). Importantly, the recognition\nof a role for emotions in argumentation does not entail a complete\nrejection of the \u201crationality\u201d of argumentation; rather,\nit is based on the rejection of a strict dichotomy between reason and\nemotion (see entry on\n emotion),\n and on a more encompassing conception of argumentation as a\nmulti-layered human activity.\n\nRather than dispassionate exchanges of reasons, instances of\nargumentation typically start against the background of existing\nemotional relations, and give rise to further affective\nresponses\u2014often, though not necessarily, negative responses of\naggression and hostility. Indeed, it has been noted that, by itself,\nargumentation can give rise to conflict and friction where there was\nnone to be found prior to the argumentative engagement (Aikin 2011).\nThis occurs in particular because critical engagement and requests for\nreasons are at odds with default norms of credulity in most mundane\ndialogical interactions, thus creating a perception of antagonism. But\nargumentation may also give rise to positive affective responses if\nthe focus is on coalescence and cooperation rather than on hostility\n(Gilbert 1997).\n\nThe descriptive claim that instances of argumentation are typically\nemotionally charged is not particularly controversial, though it\ndeserves to be further investigated; the details of affective\nresponses during instances of argumentation and how to deal with them\nare non-trivial (Krabbe & van Laar 2015). What is potentially more\ncontroversial is the normative claim that instances of\nargumentation may or should be emotionally charged,\ni.e., that emotions may or ought to be involved in argumentative\nprocesses, even if it may be necessary to regulate them in such\nsituations rather than giving them free rein (Gonz\u00e1lez,\nG\u00f3mez, & Lemos 2019). The significance of emotions for\npersuasion has been recognized for millennia (see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric),\n but more recently it has become clear that emotions also have a\nfundamental role to play for choices of what to focus on and what to\ncare about (Sinhababu 2017). This general point seems to apply to\ninstances of argumentation as well. For example, Howes and Hundleby\n(Howes & Hundleby 2018) argue that, contrary to what is often\nthought, anger can in fact make a positive contribution to\nargumentative encounters. Indeed, anger may have an important\nepistemological role in such encounters by drawing attention to\nrelevant premises and information that may otherwise go unnoticed.\n(They recognize that anger may also derail argumentation when the\nencounter becomes a full-on confrontation.)\n\nIn sum, the study of the role of emotions for argumentation, both\ndescriptively and normatively speaking, has attracted the interest of\na number of scholars, traditionally in connection with rhetoric and\nmore recently also from the perspective of argumentation as\ninterpersonal communication (Hample 2006). And yet, much work remains\nto be done on the significance of emotions for argumentation, in\nparticular given that the view that argumentation should be a purely\nrational, dispassionate endeavor remains widely (even if tacitly)\nendorsed.\n",
