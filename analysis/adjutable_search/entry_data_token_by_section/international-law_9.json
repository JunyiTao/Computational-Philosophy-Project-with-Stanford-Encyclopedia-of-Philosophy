    "main_text": "Legitimacy || Senses of Legitimacy\n4.1 Senses of Legitimacy\n\nThere are multiple ways of assessing the various dimensions of\ninternational law, such as its individual norms or bodies of norms\n(e.g., international human rights law, humanitarian law etc.) and its\nassociated institutions and enforcement mechanisms (e.g., the\nInternational Court of Justice, Security Council resolutions, etc).\nSome of these assessments relate to how international law and\ninstitutions bear on a given state\u2019s interests or policy\npreferences; others are in terms of efficiency or impact on economic\ngrowth; some are more overtly moral forms of assessment, invoking\ndemands of peace, the rule of law, justice, environmental protection,\nand so on. Of course, a key debate in international relations concerns\nthe extent to which moral values find a foothold in an international\ndomain that is \u201canarchic\u201d in the sense of lacking a\nsovereign political authority or reliable enforcement mechanisms.\n\nOne prominent moral-political rubric for assessing international law\nis the contested idea of \u201clegitimacy\u201d. Sometimes\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d is used as a catch-all term encompassing any\nkind of assessment of law, but this usage is too broad. A\nstarting-point in achieving greater specificity is the distinction\nbetween de facto (or descriptive) and de jure (or\nnormative) interpretations of legitimacy. Sometimes talk of the\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d of international law is a matter of\ndescribing the degree to which it is accepted, or complied with, by\nits putative subjects, primarily states. On this de facto\ninterpretation, an international legal norm will enjoy legitimacy to\nthe extent that it exerts a high level of \u201ccompliance\npull\u201d among international actors. A substantive study of de\nfacto legitimacy investigates the features that tend to enhance\nsupport for, and compliance with, international law (Franck 1995).\n\nBy contrast, de jure senses of \u201clegitimacy\u201d refer\nto the capacity of international law to generate reasons for action of\nvarious kinds. These might be reasons, whether prudential or moral, to\nestablish international laws and institutions, to preserve and develop\nthem once they exist, or not to interfere with their operations\n(Buchanan 2013). But de jure legitimacy is often taken to\nmean something more ambitious: the existence of a \u201cright to\nrule\u201d. On this view, some domain or institution of international\nlaw enjoys de jure legitimacy to the extent that its putative\nsubjects have a pro tanto or defeasible moral obligation to\ncomply with its directives, one that is content-independent, i.e., not\ndependent for its binding force on the specific content of any\nparticular law (Raz 2006; Green 2004 [2012]). This sense of de\njure legitimacy, as the right to rule, corresponds to the kind\nlegitimate authority that states are often interpreted as asserting in\nrelation to their members.\n\nJust as it is controversial whether international law is truly law,\nsome have also raised doubts as to whether international law should be\nassessed in terms of the \u201cright to rule\u201d asserted by\nstates. A lot of international law takes the form of treaties that\nbind only states that are parties to them. It might seem that the idea\nof a promise or contract, rather than that of legitimate rule, is the\nright template for assessing the normative force of such treaties.\nMoreover, the other main source of international law, customary\ninternational law, being the product of the convergent practice and\nattitudes of disparate state actors, does not assert a right to rule\nin the way that a unitary ruler, whether an individual or group, such\nas a legislative body, does. Yet others have claimed that, insofar as\nwe can impute a claim to rule to international law, it is not as\nstrong as that made by states, but amounts instead to a claim of the\nexistence of a moral reason for maintaining and conforming to\ninternational law, not in a content-independent moral obligation\n(Buchanan 2013).\n\nBut assuming that a right to rule is an assertion plausibly imputable\nto international law and institutions, how can we determine whether it\nis ever justified? The question is rendered all the more acute by the\nfact that in recent decades international law has increasingly\nasserted a more expansive right to rule, one that encroaches into\nareas previously regarded as belonging to the domain of state\nauthority, including such matters as the basic rights of its own\ncitizens, economic and environmental policy, and the provision of\nvital goods such as education and health care.\n",
