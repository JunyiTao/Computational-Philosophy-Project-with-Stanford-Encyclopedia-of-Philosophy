    "main_text": "Astronomical Ideas and Writings || Printing On the Revolutions and Osiander\u2019s Preface\n2.6 Sixteenth Century Reactions to On the Revolutions\n\nCopernicus\u2019s fame and book made its way across Europe over the\nnext fifty years, and a second edition was brought out in\n 1566.[13]\n As Gingerich\u2019s census of the extant copies showed, the book was\nread and commented on by astronomers (for a fuller discussion of\nreactions, see Omodeo). Gingerich (2004, 55) noted \u201cthe majority\nof sixteenth-century astronomers thought eliminating the equant was\nCopernicus\u2019 big achievement.\u201d\n\nWhile Martin Luther may have made negative comments about Copernicus\nbecause the idea of the heliocentric universe seemed to contradict the\n Bible,[14]\n Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), who presided over the\ncurriculum at the University of Wittenberg, eventually accepted the\nimportance of teaching Copernicus\u2019s ideas, perhaps because\nOsiander\u2019s preface made the work more palatable. His son-in-law\nCaspar Peucer (1525\u20131602) taught astronomy there and began\nteaching Copernicus\u2019s work. As a result, the University of\nWittenberg became a center where Copernicus\u2019s work was studied.\nBut Rheticus was the only Wittenberg scholar who accepted the\nheliocentric idea. Robert Westman (1975a, 166\u201367; 2011, chap. 5)\nsuggested that there was a \u2018Wittenberg Interpretation\u2019:\nastronomers appreciated and adopted some of Copernicus\u2019s\nmathematical models but rejected his cosmology, and some were pleased\nwith his replacement of the equant by epicyclets. One of these was\nErasmus Reinhold (1511\u20131553), a leading astronomer at Wittenberg\nwho became dean and rector. He produced a new set of planetary tables\nfrom Copernicus\u2019s work, the Prutenic Tables. Although, as\nGingerich (1993, 232) pointed out, \u201cthere was relatively little\nto distinguish between the accuracy of the Alfonsine Tables\nand the Prutenic Tables,\u201d the latter were more widely\nadopted; Gingerich plausibly suggested that the fact that the Prutenic\nTables more accurately predicted a conjunction between Jupiter and\nSaturn in 1563 made the difference. Reinhold did not accept the\nheliocentric theory, but he admired the elimination of the equant. The\nPrutenic Tables excited interest in Copernicus\u2019s work.\n\nTycho Brahe (1546\u20131601) was the greatest astronomical observer\nbefore the invention of the telescope. He called Copernicus a\n\u2018second Ptolemy\u2019 (quoted in Westman 1975, 307) and\nappreciated both the elimination of the equant and the creation of a\nplanetary system. But Tycho could not adopt the Copernican system,\npartly for the religious reason that it went against what the Bible\nseemed to preach. He, therefore, adopted a compromise, the\n\u2018geoheliostatic\u2019 system in which the two inner planets\nrevolved around the sun and that system along with the rest of the\nplanets revolved around the earth.\n\nAmong Catholics, Christoph Clavius (1537\u20131612) was the leading\nastronomer in the sixteenth century. A Jesuit himself, he incorporated\nastronomy into the Jesuit curriculum and was the principal scholar\nbehind the creation of the Gregorian calendar. Like the Wittenberg\nastronomers, Clavius adopted Copernican mathematical models when he\nfelt them superior, but he believed that Ptolemy\u2019s cosmology\n\u2013 both his ordering of the planets and his use of the equant\n\u2013 was correct.\n\nPope Clement VII (r. 1523\u20131534) had reacted favorably to a talk\nabout Copernicus\u2019s theories, rewarding the speaker with a rare\nmanuscript. There is no indication of how Pope Paul III, to whom\nOn the Revolutions was dedicated reacted; however, a trusted\nadvisor, Bartolomeo Spina of Pisa (1474\u20131546) intended to\ncondemn it but fell ill and died before his plan was carried out (see\nRosen, 1975). Thus, in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on\nthe Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When\nGiordano Bruno (1548\u20131600) was burned at the stake as a heretic,\nit had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican\ncosmology, and this is clearly shown in Finocchiaro\u2019s\nreconstruction of the accusations against Bruno (see also\nBlumenberg\u2019s part 3, chapter 5, titled \u201cNot a Martyr for\nCopernicanism: Giordano Bruno\u201d).\n\nMichael Maestlin (1550\u20131631) of the University of T\u00fcbingen\nwas the earliest astronomer after Rheticus to adopt Copernicus\u2019s\nheliocentricism. Although he wrote a popular textbook that was\ngeocentric, he taught his students that the heliocentric system was\nsuperior. He also rejected Osiander\u2019s preface. Maestlin\u2019s\npupil Johannes Kepler wrote the first book since the publication of\nOn the Revolutions that was openly heliocentric in its\norientation, the Mysterium cosmographicum (Secret of the\nUniverse). And, of course, Kepler eventually built on\nCopernicus\u2019s work to create a much more accurate description of\nthe solar system.\n",
