A dominant\ntheme in this literature was whether a pre-existing health state, or\nresulting health outcome, should be taken into account when allocating\nhealth resources. More specifically, the debate centered on whether a\nperson\u2019s disability should be taken into account, or whether\ndoing so would be discriminatory or unfair. As Dan Brock explained it,\nthis concern was raised because of the confluence of two\nevents\u2014the then recent (1990) passage of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), prohibiting discrimination on the basis\nof disability, and the 1992 Oregon Medicaid proposal for rationing\nservices, which used both CEA and a quality of life outcome measure to\nprioritize treatments for persons with specific health conditions and\nwhich arguably systematically disadvantaged people with pre-existing\ndisabilities (Brock 1995, 1999, 2004).\n\nThe ethics of health care allocation or rationing raises a raft of\nissues that are not directly dependent on the potential discriminatory\nimpact on persons with disabilities. Yet, since it is difficult to\nclearly separate the general ethical issues from those raised by the\nfocus on disability, we begin in Section 1 by surveying, first,\ngeneral ethical concerns in health care rationing, and then the\nspecific issues raised by CEA and quality of life as a metric of the\n\u201cbenefit\u201d that health care resources provide. We then turn\nin Section 2 to review why it has been argued that disability poses a\nspecial set of ethical issues in health care rationing. The ethical\nissues of health resource rationing (or \u201cprioritization\u201d\nas it is sometimes called) can be exemplified either at the individual\nlevel of specific allocation decisions \u201cat the bedside\u201d,\nor more generally as a social policy of health care rationing. The\nethical issues at the individual level are reviewed in Section 2, and\nsocial policy issues are considered in Section 3, including whether it\nmakes any difference if access to health care is viewed as a human\nright. We conclude in Section 4 with the unsatisfactory result that we\nremain in a dilemma: refusing to consider disability in health care\nallocation seems irrational and unfair, but taking disability into\naccount raises a range of, apparently, irresolvable philosophical\nissues.\n", "toc": [{"#EthiHealCareRati": "1.

The Ethics of Health Care Rationing\n1.1 Rationing health resources\n\nWhat are the principal ethical concerns involved in how we allocate\nscarce medical resources to people who can benefit from them? Health\ncare resources (broadly construed to include treatments or\ninterventions, medications, medical and rehabilitative devices, health\ncare services and service providers, health care systems, clinics and\nother settings, and so on) are by their nature scarce resources. They\nare scarce both as a consequence of societal, macro-allocative\ndecisions about how much social resources are put into health care\n(rather than, say, into education, scientific research or fighting\nforeign wars), and because some of these resources, such as\ntransplantable organs, are intrinsically scarce. \n\nScarcity entails that health resource demands will always overwhelm\nsupply, which in turn entails that some method of constrained\nallocation must take place. Rationing is the generic name for this and\nit comes in many forms: implicit or explicit, case-by-case or\nsystematic, rational and fair or the opposite, overt, transparent and\nprofessionally-sanctioned, or hidden, unexamined and rationalized as\nsomething other than rationing. The key point is that rationing is\nunavoidable and always occurs. As health economists insist, since\nrationing of health care resources is inevitable, best it be open,\ntransparently justified and understandable, based on good evidence and\nargument (Ubel 2000). The ethicist agrees, but adds the consideration\nof fairness.\n\nA persuasive criterion of rationality in rationing is efficiency:\nsince supply is not infinite we must ensure that every allocated\nresource is used to achieve the maximum benefit it can provide. While\nin some domains the nature of a \u201cbenefit\u201d is\ncontroversial, here it is obvious: health resources produce health\nbenefits, either incremental improvements in health or the prevention\nof worsening health and premature death. Understanding death (or\npremature death) as the worst health outcome, life-saving or\nlife-prolonging is (usually) a clear health benefit. But so is\nimproving bodily functioning, mitigating or ameliorating functional\nproblems or preventing functional decline. Although death is not\npreventable, disease, injuries, and other challenges to an\nindividual\u2019s health can either be prevented or their impact\nlessened, either indefinitely or for some period of time. Health\noutcomes, in short, are either quantitative (number of years lost to a\nhealth challenge) or qualitative (extent of functioning lost).\n\nIf we define a \u201chealth need\u201d as any decrement in health\n(either years to live or a less-than-optimal level of bodily\nfunctioning), health resource efficiency is a matter of using health\nresources to minimize ill-health in a manner that does not waste\nhealth care resources. In the case of a single individual, there is no\nissue: give the person the resources he or she actually requires and\nnothing more. But resource allocation is only an issue when there is\nmore than one claimant to the same, scarce, resource. Resource\nallocation is a problem of fairness across populations. This leads us\nto the question of distributional fairness where, as we shall see\nbelow, there are various competing options besides CEA. At first\nglance, however, the general efficiency requirement that scarce health\nresources be used to maximize benefit or minimize need seems strongly\nintuitive. \n\nThe intuitive plausibility of the efficiency requirement is the\nmotivation for the rationing strategy based on cost-effectiveness\nanalysis (CEA). The health resource is a cost, the health improvement\na benefit, and intuitively we should try to get as much benefit from\nthe cost as possible. Alternatively put, CEA mandates that the lower\nthe cost per unit of health improvement the more effective the use of\nthe associated health resource. Although this strategy can in\nprinciple be applied to health resource usage at the individual level,\nCEA, reflecting its intellectual heritage as a form of utilitarianism,\nis standardly viewed as a societal strategy in which costs and\nbenefits are aggregated over the population.\n\nIn practice, though, cost-effectiveness analysis in health care\nallocation faces a substantial methodological hurdle: there is a vast\narray of incommensurable health improvements\u2014lowering pain\nlevels in arthritis, improving muscle strength or respiration\nefficiency, controlling high blood pressure, adding a year to life,\npostponing the onset of dementia. Since CEA requires health\nimprovements to be comparable between individuals and across the\npopulation, an underlying health improvement metric\u2014what\nstatisticians call a \u201clatent trait\u201d\u2014needs to be\nidentified that is (at least) ordinal and comparable, if not precisely\nmeasurable. We need to identify, in short, what every health\nimprovement shares in common. That is the measure of a health\nimprovement, and the benefit that factors into the CEA\ncalculation.\n\nThe most commonly used metric is called \u201cquality of\nlife\u201d\u2014every health improvement, whatever else it\naccomplishes, incrementally improves the individual\u2019s quality of\nlife. Given that a health improvement is potentially either\nquantitative or qualitative (extending life or improving life), it is\nnecessary to bring these two facets into a single measure (called,\ngenerically, a summary health measure). A common way of doing this is\nin terms of the econometric concept of quality-adjusted life year or\nQALY. Every health improvement produces a health state with an\nexpected longevity (the number of years left to live) and level of\nfunctioning (the quality of living in that health state). These can be\nmetrically joined into a single score by using the common metric of\nyears lives and discounting the value of a year lived in a particular\nhealth state by the quality of life value of living in that state. If\nfull health is represented by the value of 1, death by 0, then the\nquality of life values of all possible states of health a human can\nexperience can be assigned a number between 1 and 0, and that number\ndetermines the quality of life impact of the health state on a person,\nin terms of some proportion of a full life year. The values for each\nstate can be generated by a population ranking exercise (as was done\nin the Oregon example), by expert consensus, or by means of a variety\nof econometric \u201cpreference elicitation techniques\u201d such as\n\u201cstandard gamble\u201d, \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d or\n\u201cperson trade off\u201d (see Nord 1999 for the details of these\ntechniques in the health domain).\n\nAlthough the most commonly used in health resource prioritization, the\nQALY is not the only health benefit summary measure. The\ndisability-adjusted life year or DALY operates similarly to the QALY,\nalthough conversely in terms of the burden of living with a\ndisability, measured in life-years (see Murray 1996). Here 0 is again\ndeath and 1 full health and a DALY score measures a health state as a\nfunction of life-years lost to disability. To compare the two\nmeasures, if the quality-adjusted factor associated with a health\nstate like spinal cord injury (SCI) is 0.4, then the quality of each\nyear of life post-injury is 0.4 of a year lived in full health. If one\nis expected to live another 30 years, then the overall QALY is 12\nyears. DALYs work the same way, only in reverse: the person with the\nSCI would have the overall life burden of 0.6 times 30 years or 18\ndisability-adjusted life years. (There are other differences between\nthe two measures that are more technical in nature and can be ignored\nin this discussion.)\n\nWhile QALYs are most commonly used as measure of the benefit from\nhealth resources for CEA in health allocation strategies (e.g.,\nUK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nuses QALYs for quality of care determinations), DALYs have been\nextensively used by the World Health Organization and the World\nBank\u2014and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in\nSeattle, Washington\u2014to determine the population burden of\ndisease and injuries, primarily for public health applications,\nincluding especially national priority setting (Jamison et al. 2006,\nupdated in Das & Samarasekera 2012).\n\nThe natural home of the CEA approach to allocation is at the\ninstitutional or meso-allocative level where decisions are made far\nfrom the individual bedside and are hidden from view in the form of\nhospital reimbursement policies and clinical guidelines. At the\nhighest policy level of macro-allocation where overall national health\nbudgets are developed, only the most technocratic of societies would\nhave an explicit prioritization strategy based on CEA. In most\ndemocratic societies, health care budgets are determined by a complex\ninterplay of politics and bureaucratic pressures. These forces tend to\nallocate more resources to urban areas, focus on curative rather than\npreventive services, and cater to special constituencies or those with\nthe more highly paid lobbyists: all of which is demonstrably\ninefficient. Worse yet, in many countries, health care resource\nmacro-allocation is governed by ability to pay, which is the most\nstraightforwardly inefficient (not to say inequitable) allocation\nstrategy there is. \n\nAt the level of meso-allocation\u2014the distribution of health care\nresources across a single institution, such as a hospital or\nclinic\u2014much of what is called \u201crationing at the\nbedside\u201d is disguised as standard clinical practice (Ubel 2000).\nIf a physician\u2014whether motivated by pressures from hospital\nadministrators, managed care organization or insurance company, or\nmerely excising her or his professional expertise\u2014decides to\nforego live-saving treatment for a patient on the grounds that the\nhealth benefits would not warrant the use of the resource, then the\njudgment clearly reflects, rough and ready, intuitive application of\nCEA. Or if a treatment is not provided because it is judged\n\u201cmedically futile\u201d, that judgment is in effect a\ncost-benefit analysis. Treatments are said to be \u201cfutile\u201d\nwhen in the physician\u2019s judgment the expected health benefits do\nnot sufficiently outweigh the costs of providing the care (Crossley\n1995; Batavia 2002). Similarly, \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d or\nDNR orders, while they may be equally motivated by futility or even\ncompassion, are essentially CEA rationing techniques, although here\nthe judgment is that the resource would have no benefit at all. \n1.2 Ethical concerns with CEA and QALYs as a prioritization strategy\n\nAt least as compared to pure politics or the \u201cfree\nmarket\u201d, using CEA with a metric such as QALY for rationing the\nuse of health resources has the strongest claim to rationality. But\nwhat of its ethical acceptability? Even strong advocates of using CEA\nto ration health resources acknowledge that it suffers from at least\nfive fundamental (and interconnected) ethical concerns. Some of these\nconcerns only make sense at the population level of meso-allocations,\nbut all affect, directly or indirectly, allocation decisions at the\nindividual level (Daniels 1993, 1994, 1998; Brock 1995, 1998; Brock\n& Wikler 2006).\n1.2.1 The aggregation problem\n\nTo calculate the effectiveness of care resource utilization at the\npopulation level requires both resource costs and quality of life\nbenefits to be aggregated in terms of the expected number of uses of\neach resource. A low-cost and low-benefit, but widely used resource\nwill tend to rank as more efficient than a high-cost and high-benefit,\nbut rarely used resource. This can lead to counter-intuitive results.\nFor example, when the Oregon government tried to put into place a plan\nto lower Medicaid costs using CEA and QALY they began by identifying\ntreatment/condition pairs\u2014that is, types of treatments provided\nto patients with different kinds of health conditions\u2014and from\nthese created a rationing priority list in terms of expected QALY\nbenefits from treatment. One of the consequences of the plan was that\nthe treatment of capping teeth was far higher on the priority list\nthan appendectomy, even though no one would die from uncapped teeth\nwhile untreated appendicitis could be lethal. The reason was obvious:\nyou could pay for many hundred instances of teeth capping for the\nprice of a single appendectomy, and adding up all of the small but\nnon-zero QALY benefits from the capping would trump the QALY benefits\nof the appendectomy. This result was widely viewed as profoundly\ncounterintuitive (although some argued that our intuitions are not\nalways as clearly opposed to favoring aggregated benefits [Kamm 1993;\nNord 1999]).\n1.2.2 The priority problem\n\nOne of the apparent ethical advantages of CEA is its commitment to\nequality and impartiality: everyone\u2019s health needs are\nconsidered equally, irrespective of race, gender, or income level. But\nas the aggregation problem suggests, we intuitively believe that\nsaving a person\u2019s life is ethically more important than\nimproving their appearance. More generally, it is an open ethical\nquestion whether we should skew our distribution of health resources\ntowards those who are worst off or whose health needs are more\nsignificant or urgent; and if we do so, it is not clear how much extra\nweight these considerations should have in our assessment. An\nadditional open question, to which we will return below, is whether\nthe \u201cworst off\u201d should be defined in terms of health state\nor some other disadvantage as well. One version of the underlying\nintuition at work here is the often cited \u201crule of\nrescue\u201d: since saving a life is arguably of infinite or at least\nindefinite benefit, we should always rank allocations that save a life\nthe highest. For example, if a community spends a substantial part of\nits yearly health care budget on rescuing a small child who has fallen\ndown a well, this is ethically justifiable, according to the rule of\nrescue, although patently inefficient (see the debates in Hadorn 1992;\nJonson 1986; Cookson & Dolan 1999: Nord 1999; and Ubel 2000).\n\nThe priority problem need not be characterized in terms of who is\nworst off so much as who most deserves the resource. For example,\nshould it matter, all things being equal, whether a resource is\nprovided to an elderly person who will not benefit as much from the\nresource as a younger person? In general, should the age of the\nrecipient matter? CEA tends to favor highly efficient resource users,\nwho will normally be younger, and some non-utilitarian philosophers\nhave argued that as long as we ensure everyone a normal\nlifespan\u2014or \u201cfair innings\u201d as Williams (1997) calls\nit\u2014then ranking older recipients lower is not unfair.\nAlternatively, it has been strongly argued that, benefit\nnotwithstanding, people who live unhealthy lives and are responsible\nfor their health needs should be downgraded or lose their priority\n(Moss & Siegler 1991; Wikler 2002; Cappelen & Norheim 2006).\n(Although the examples used for this argument tend to be drug addicts,\nsmokers, drinkers, and other discreditable risk takers, the argument,\nif successful, would also apply to athletes and heroes who risk their\nlives.)\n1.2.3 The democracy problem\n\nThe Oregon prioritization scheme based its QALY evaluations on a\ngeneral resident\u2019s survey in order, it was claimed, to capture\n\u201ccommunity values\u201d. But why should these values determine\nwhich treatments are funded, since (as was demonstrable in the actual\nrankings that resulted) these values may reflect cultural or racial\nbiases or just profound misunderstandings about health problems and\nwhat it is like to live with a disability (Asch 2001; Doyal 1998)? On\nthe other hand, it is the public who pays for these health resources\nso why should some group of elites, however knowledgeable, pre-empt\nmajoritarian decisions (Brock 2002)?\n1.2.4 The indirect benefits problem\n\nSince CEA weighs benefits against costs, it is natural to ask whether\nbenefits should be restricted to health benefits alone, or should\ninclude other, more indirect benefits such as the economic benefit to\nthe individual from returning to work or the financial benefits to\nemployers from reducing lost work time due to employee illness (Brock\n2003). Economists would favor the broader conception of benefit since\nit provides a better calculation of the societal value of a health\ncare prioritization scheme. More finely-gained benefit assessment\nwould also allow us to make more ethically sensitive judgments about\nwhere money should be spent: e.g., it would be ethically justifiable\nto favor the health of mothers of children who need their care. On the\nother side, not only is it extremely difficult to quantify these\nbenefits, it has also been argued that it is unfair to prioritize\nhealth care resources to favor patients whose improved health has\ngreater indirect benefits to themselves or society since that is to\ntreat people and their health as means to social ends. Economic or\nother benefits and health improvements are in \u201cseparate\nspheres\u201d and merging them will make our health prioritization\nstrategy both ethically compromised, and practically unworkable (Brock\n2003).\n1.2.5 The fair chances vs. best outcomes problem\n\nThe final concern is actually at the heart of all of the above\nconcerns since it points to the underlying ethical tension between\naggregate goodness and fairness\u2014between the utilitarian approach\nof CEA and the deontological or egalitarian concern for fairness. The\naptly named \u201cfair chances\u201d approach is grounded on our\nbasic intuition that people deserve equal concern and respect, and so\nan equal chance at benefiting from an allocation scheme. If two people\nneed a heart transplant to live, and one will live twenty more years\nwith the new heart but the other only two years, is it really fair to\nuse CEA and give the heart to the first? Is that truly giving both\npeople an equal or fair chance to the health resource? Or again, if\ntwo people need a surgery to repair a torn cartilage in their knees,\nand one of these also has serious asthma, is it fair to prioritize the\nsurgery to the first because the overall QALYs benefit of the person\nwith asthma is lower? \n\nOn the other side, the egalitarian \u201cfair chances\u201d approach\ncan hardly be the whole story since the only allocation strategy that\nfits a purely egalitarian approach is random allocation or a lottery.\nA lottery is vaguely fair when the two potential beneficiaries incur\nthe same costs and benefits, but not when the benefits accrued from a\nresource are hugely different, or when other considerations, such as\nurgency, enter into the calculation. Some egalitarians have\nbacktracked from pure randomness of a lottery (so that the asthmatic\nin the above example would have a somewhat lower chance of being\nsuccessful\u2014see Brock 1988; Broome 1988, 2004). Others have\nargued that considerations like urgency, the level of overall health\nneed, or age should affect the proportional chances of success (Kamm\n1993). Yet others have insisted that the asthmatic has already lost\nthe \u201cnatural lottery\u201d by having a serious health\ncondition, so there is no need to run another lottery (Menzel 1989).\nThese attempts aside, the lottery approach is not greatly favored,\nexcept as a last resort.\n1.3 Current state of debate on health resource prioritization\n\nThe philosophical debate on health resource prioritization has been\nsomewhat muted in recent years. A fragile truce has been reached in\nwhich it is admitted that we cannot accept either a purely utilitarian\nCEA approach unalloyed with considerations of fairness, or a purely\negalitarian lottery approach unaffected by intuitions concerning the\nsignificance of ineffective use of valuable resources. In part this is\nbecause of an intractable dilemma that dominates the rationing debate,\nwhich we will describe more specifically for the case of disability in\nthe next section. We seem to be stuck between two extremes: allocate\nin terms of a \u201cneutral\u201d consideration such as \u201cfirst\ncome first serve\u201d or pure lottery, or open the door to an\nunlimited number of potentially ethically relevant considerations\nthat, together, make the allocation decision overwhelming difficult\nand cumbersome. The first option seems irrational, the second\nimpractical.\n\nAnother reason for the stalemate is the aggregation problem as applied\nto the \u201cbenefit\u201d side of the CEA calculation. Some have\nargued that we should abandon the QALY and DALY, summary health\nmeasure technology entirely (Anand & Wailoo 2000), while most\nagree with Dan Brock that health care prioritization without any\nreference to quality of life is a non-starter (Brock 1995). There have\nbeen some attempts at finding a workable multi-criteria approach in\nwhich health benefits are disaggregated into separate components\n(Baltussen & Niessen 2006), but such suggestions open the door to\nthe so-called \u201cindexing problem\u201d (discussed later in the\ncontext of disability) of trying to sum up disparate and\nincommensurable benefits (income, happiness, social productivity,\ncreativity) in a way that would allow us to compare two health\noutcomes. Attempts at direct head-to-head comparisons between health\noutcomes require the dubious methodological assumption that health is\nunidimensional: walking out of the hospital with one\nsurviving hand is obviously better than with none; but is being left\npartially sighted better, or worse, than ending up in a wheelchair?\nHow do we compare various domains of human functioning that, together,\nmake up the state of health?\n\nThis then is the general ethical backdrop against which the special\nmoral concern about the impact of disability on health resource\nprioritization must be placed. We begin with why it is that\ndisability\u2014of the myriad of differences between people that\nmight matter in how we decide to allocate health care\nresources\u2014is different.\n2. Why does disability pose a problem for health care rationing?\n2.1 The difference disability makes\n\nThe situation of persons with disabilities is a special ethical\nconcern for health care allocation because disability is not just any\nhuman difference\u2014like age, gender or ethnicity\u2014or any\nsocial disadvantage\u2014like poverty, gender discrimination, or\nminority marginalization. Disability is both a difference and a\ndisadvantage that is conceptually linked to a person\u2019s\nhealth state, and therefore health needs. All disability theorists\nthese days agree that the physical, social and attitudinal environment\nin which a person with a health problem or functional impairment lives\nwill make a huge difference to their perceived\n\u201cdisability\u201d the person will experience (WHO\n2001). Although there are a few hold-outs of the so-called\n\u201csocial model\u201d that insist that disability is a pure\n\u201csocial construction\u201d that has nothing to do with the\nstate of a person\u2019s health (see Oliver 1990), the Consensus is\nthat disability is conceptually linked to health: without an\nunderlying health problem or impairment there is no disability.\n\nWhile the actual health needs of persons with disabilities, even\nsevere disabilities, varies enormously, the conceptual link to health\nand human functioning means that health is not merely contingently\nrelated to disability, as gender, poverty or even quality of life are.\nMoreover, disability is not merely conceptually linked to health, it\nis linked to some problem with or decrement in health. This explains\nwhy the case of disability raises the priority problem in clear\nrelief: every person with a disability is potentially a less-efficient\nhealth care resource user since they have an ex ante\n(pre-allocation) health problem. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that disability is not conceptually\nlinked to (lower) quality of life. Unfortunately, there is good\nevidence that it is commonly believed that people with disabilities\nsuffer from a lower quality of life associated with their level of\nfunctioning or premature mortality, and that ex ante\ndecrement in quality of life may not be fundamentally altered by the\nhealth resource (Albrecht & Devlieger 1999). This empirical fact\nis the source of the democracy problem as it applies to disability\nsince if the general public is laboring under a general prejudice\nabout what it means to live with a disability, then they will be more\neasily persuaded that disability is an additional cost, or limits the\nbenefit received (or both).\n\nTo be sure, there can be no doubt that disability incurs additional\npersonal and social costs in the form of impairment-related resources\nsuch as assistive technology (wheelchairs, hearing aids, and augmented\ncommunication devices); changes to make their world more accessible\n(curb cuts, audible stop lights, elevators, accessible toilets and\ndisability parking); and social services such as income maintenance,\ndisability pensions and vocational rehabilitation. By the same token\nthe health care needs of persons with disabilities may be more costly\nto provide, given potential complications and co-morbidities as well\nas the accommodations that may be required to ensure access to health\ncare (for example, that examination tables can accommodate persons\nwith complete lower body paralysis). Because of this, however, people\nwith disabilities will always have to face the converse of the\nindirect benefits problem: as a population, they incur health and\nnon-health costs that, if factored into the cost of the health\nimprovement associated with a health resource, would tilt the CEA\nefficiency calculation against them.\n2.2 Disability and individual, head-to-head allocation\n\nTaking all this together the result is, from the perspective of CEA\nreasoning, that disability seems to be a salient consideration for\nresource allocation. For the rest of this section, we will review what\nhas been said about how disability impacts the ethics of health care\nallocation, and in particular how the five problems mentioned above\nplay out in the case of disability.\n\nThere are two perspectives in which these intuitions can be tested: at\nthe level of individual, head-to-head allocation contests and at the\nlevel of social policies or strategies about health care allocation\nacross the population. In the first case we presume a head-to-head\ncomparison between a person with and another without a disability,\nboth of whom require the medical treatment or resource that, for\nwhatever reason, can only be available to one of them. We will have\noccasion below to question the philosophical value of head-to-head\nallocation scenarios, but there is no doubt they have emotional power\nand put the impact of disability into stark relief. Interestingly,\nalthough the impact of disability on rationing was initially raised\nlegally in terms of rationing policy (the Oregon rationing experiment\nmentioned above), despite creative legal academic discussions (Garvey\n1992; Peters 1995; Orentlicher 1996; and Crossley 2000), United States\ncourts were reluctant to move from the individual case to the policy\nlevel in the rationing debate because they were impressed by the\nargument that prioritization of health resources was simply\nunavoidable and so not discriminatory as a general policy. We return\nto this point below in the context of human rights and the impact of\ndisability.\n2.3 Problematic scenarios at the individual level\n\nIn this section we explore the ethical issues involved in health\nresource rationing involving disability at the individual level\n(leaving the ethics of rationing policy for the next section). For\nconcreteness, we look at allocation scenarios commonly used in the\nliterature to highlight the impact of disability on the allocation\nstrategy of CEA using the QALY metric to define health resource use\nbenefit, or to test other intuitions about non-utilitarian,\negalitarian principles of fair distribution. There are many, many\ndifferent variations on these examples that can be imagined to test\nour intuitions, but these will give a flavor of this form of\nphilosophical analysis. The cases are divided naturally into those in\nwhich life itself is at stake and those in which some non-fatal health\noutcome involving an improvement in functioning (stabilization of\nfunctioning, or prevention of further functional decline) is at\nstake.\n\nNote: For all the examples below, let A represent a person with\na disability and B and C persons without. We make no\nassumption about what kind or severity of disability is involved,\nexcept to remind ourselves that the underlying impairments may be\ntrivial (a congenital port wine stain on one\u2019s face), although\nsocially stigmatizing, or moderate (arthritic pain affecting\nmobility), or extremely severe (life-threatening blood pressure or\ncompromised lung function). We assume that A, B, and\nC ex post (before the resource is administered) all\nhave roughly the same health needs with respect to the proposed\ntreatment or resource use, although A may have other health\nneeds associated with her pre-existing disability.\n\nLife-saving cases:\n\n A has a shorter life expectancy, post-treatment than\nB, but the treatment will save the lives of both A and\nB.\n A and B have the same life expectancy\npost-treatment, but B will have a higher quality of life.\n A\u2019s disability is such that the chances that the\nlife-saving treatment will be wholly effective, or its potential for\npositive effect, are greatly diminished in comparison with\nB.\n Neither C nor B have pre-existing disabilities, but\npost-treatment we have good reason to believe that C will\nacquire a disability and B will not, and that disability will\neither lessen C\u2019s life expectancy, or quality of life, or\nboth.\n\n\nIn all of these scenarios, the CEA and QALY allocation strategy would\nprima facie favor the non-disabled individual B. Both\nthe priority and the indirect benefits problems are at work here.\nAlthough this result seems intuitively acceptable for case (iii),\nsince the treatment to A would be a total waste of a scarce\nresource, and unfair if B could benefit from it. But it is far\nless clear what we would say if the effectiveness of the treatment was\nless obviously compromised by the disability. As for cases (i), (ii)\nand (iv) the CEA analysis is at least troubling because the preference\nis based exclusively on A\u2019s (or for case iv),\nC\u2019s) disability, or ex ante quality of life. We\nmight not think it relevant what kind of life a person would live\nafter a medical treatment, and differences in life expectancy would\nonly be relevant if they were very stark\u2014say A would only\nlive a few weeks, but B several decades.\n\nHealth improvement cases:\n\n A\u2019s disability acts like a co-morbidity and reduces\nthe efficacy of the proposed treatment so that the treatment has a\nless quality of life-enhancing outcome for A than it does for\nB.\n A\u2019s disability makes the treatment more complex,\nextended and more costly than it is for B, even though the\nresulting outcomes may be identical.\n C and B have no pre-existing disabilities, but we\nknow that C will acquire one post-treatment and because of this\nthe quality of life-enhancing outcome will be less for C than\nfor B.\n\n\nFor cases (i) and (iii), primarily because of the use of QALY as a\nmetric for benefit, the standard strategy for health resource\nallocation would favor B over A or C: because of\ntheir disabilities, ex post or ex ante, individuals\nA and C have worst health resource use outcomes than\nB. As with the life-saving cases, our intuitions seem to depend\non how great the gap in quality of life is between A (or\nC) and B. Should A and C experience an\nextremely low quality of life after the treatment, while B\nexperience very high quality of life, then we are tempted to favor\nB; but when the differences are minimal, then favoring B\nover A seems arbitrary and unfair. The case of (ii) puts the\ndisadvantage on the cost rather than the benefit side, with the result\nthat CEA would favor B. Again, our intuitions here seem to be\naffected by magnitude: if the cost difference is trivial, then it\nseems unfair to favor B; if the differences are enormous, then\nour utilitarian intuitions seem more dominant and we would favor\nB. In general, once the subtleties of proportional benefit or\nproportional cost are considered, our intuitions are actually very\nfluid.\n2.4 What do head-to-head examples really tell us?\n\nFrancis Kamm has relied almost exclusively on individual head-to-head\nexamples such as these to explore intuitions about the ethical\nsignificance of disability in allocation decisions (Kamm 1993, 2004,\n2009a and b). Although her examples are vivid and the discussions\noften ethically illuminating, at the end of the day, one is left with\nthe sense that relying on our intuitions about these scenarios (and\ntheir infinite variations) is a troublingly and indeterminate\nexercise. The unrealistic simplicity of the cases might create\nskepticism about how the debate has been framed. Surely, no health\ncare decision, at the individual level, would ever be this stark and\ndevoid of uncertainties. We are never completely sure whether our\ntreatments will improve functioning, even save lives, or whether\nunintended side effects will end up making the outcome worse. In\naddition, measuring benefit in terms of QALYs is not an exact science,\nand the measurement of cost is extremely difficult, especially if, in\naddition to the direct costs from the provision of the resource, we\nadd indirect costs and opportunity costs. Although the method of\ntesting our intuitions on artificial scenarios, making increasingly\nnuanced changes in the case to highlight salient considerations, is\nphilosophical illuminating, it may arguably be somewhat\nartificial.\n\nOur intuitions seem both stable and reliable for ex ante\nexamples, where a decision is made to allocate the resource to the\nnon-disabled individual solely or automatically in terms of the\npresence of a disability in the other candidate, without any\nconsideration of relative cost or benefit or the most rudimentary use\nof CEA. Surely such a decision would be the very essence of\nprejudicial and unfair. But even here our intuitions are not\ncompletely secure since it may make a difference how the allocation\ndecision is framed. \n\nSuppose we are asked to decide between a person in a wheelchair and\nsomeone without a severe disability. If the issue is framed crudely in\nterm of \u201clives worth living\u201d and we decide on\nstereotypical and ungrounded assumptions about the abject misery of\nliving in a wheelchair, ex ante, then a case could be made\nthat our decision to favor the person without a disability was\nirrational, unfair, and discriminatory. By contrast, suppose we cast\nthe situation as one in which unavoidable scarcity necessitates a\nchoice that, however it goes, will be regrettable and unfortunate\n(sometimes called a \u201ctragic choice\u201d: see Calabresi &\nBobbitt 1978 and Nussbaum 2000). So framed, we might seem far more\nethically justified in appealing to disability, or indeed any other\nreal difference between the two individuals that is, at least in\nprinciple, relevant to our judgment. Disability, as we have seen, is an\na priori relevant consideration to health care allocation.\nWe might argue that, after all, we have no option but to choose\nsomeone (choosing no one would be both wasteful and unfair to both).\nAgainst this it might be argued that fairness in such a circumstance\ncan only be achieved by a purely random choice. \n\n3. Disability as a systematic rationing consideration: ethical concerns\n3.1 The dilemma created by CEA\n\nThe individual allocation scenarios just described are powerful\n\u201cintuition pumps\u201d (Dennett 2013) because they emphasize a\ndirect competition between two individuals over the same required\nhealth resource. Yet if the only lesson we can draw from the\nlife-saving and health improvement scenarios is that our intuitions\nabout whether disability matters are clearer the starker the contrast\nin benefit or cost, this does not seem to advance the debate very\nmuch. Given that there is already a concern about the unrealistic\nsimplicity of the individual cases, perhaps we can get a better result\nby asking whether, and in what way, disability is a relevant ethical\nconsideration as a general social policy or allocation strategy that\nwill be consistently and neutrally applied to everyone, without\nexception.\n\nIf we are considering a social policy or population strategy for\nallocation, we are seemingly bound by basic principles of procedural\nfairness that pre-empt special-pleading and other exceptions. These\nprinciples are also principles of rationality, and in the case of\nallocation policy they obviously apply. But there are also special\npresumptions about an allocation policy that also tap into our\nintuitions about the rationality of a general policy, but concern the\nspecific nature of an allocation policy. There appear to be three\npresumptions about such a policy that cannot be sensibly challenged:\nA) the rationing or prioritizing policy is necessary because health\nresources are scare; B) resource use effectiveness, if not the end of\nthe story, is at least part of it; and C) some ordinal measure of\nhealth outcomes must be used to compare outcomes.\n\nEffectiveness, as we saw, is both a matter of the costs of using a\nhealth resource and the benefits accrued. At the policy level it is\nfar more important to be clear about what range of costs are relevant\n(should we include indirect and lost opportunity cost?) as well as\nwhat constitutes a relevant benefit (should we include enhanced\nemployment prospects, a more financially secure family situation, and\nso on?). The cost side of the equation is rarely considered by\nbioethicists, which is a clear gap in the debate. The benefit side has\nbeen considered, as noted above, by Brock and others under the wider\nrubric of the \u201cseparate spheres\u201d problem (Brock 2003;\nBroome 2004). We can ignore these complications in what follows and\nrestrict the issue of effectiveness, as is usually done in this\nliterature, to a single criterion: the capacity to benefit\ndirectly from a health resource.\n\nWhatever our intuitions may suggest at the individual level, when we\nturn to a general allocation policy, it is clear that disability has a\npotential impact both on cost and the capacity to directly benefit,\nand a blanket refusal to take disability into account would be both\nirrational and unfair. Importantly, ignoring disability is irrational\nand unfair for everyone, including people with disabilities. If the\npresence of a disability makes a medical treatment ineffective,\nextremely impractical or vastly expensive, it would be foolish to\nignore this fact. It would be unfair to those without a disability who\nneed and could benefit from the treatment; but it would also be unfair\nfor a person with a disability to ignore the fact that some of his or\nher needs would be unsatisfied, and some medical treatment of no use\nto him or her (or potentially harmful). This means that disability is\nnot only ethically relevant at the policy level, but in fact it needs\nto be factored into the selection of resource or treatment and of the\nmode, method, and context by which the resource is delivered. \n\nBut if disability intrinsically affects costs of delivery and capacity\nto benefit, allocation policy appears to be trapped in a dilemma: CEA\nsystematically disadvantages people with disabilities in health\nresource prioritization, but it is both irrational and unfair (to\neveryone, including people with disabilities) to ignore\ndisability-related differences in costs and capacity to benefit when\nprioritizing health care resources.\n3.2 Resolving the dilemma: first attempts\n\nSome disability advocates argue that there is no real dilemma here\nsince \u201ccapacity to benefit\u201d is merely a cloak for the\nprejudice that the life of disabled person, like that of the elderly,\nis of intrinsically less value and deserving of less effort to\npreserve or improve (Asch 2001). These advocates have a point since\nprecisely this view can be seen in the pronouncements of respectable\nbioethicists who do assert that the \u201cdisabled life\u201d is\nfundamentally inferior (Kuhse & Singer 1985; Singer 1983; McKie et\nal. 1998). In the case of disability, for some writers, lower capacity\nto benefit is not an empirical conclusion, but an a priori\nassumption (Veach 1986; Harris 1986; Anand & Hanson 1997; Arneson\n& Nord 1999; Rock 2000; Koch 2000). CEA systematically\ndisadvantages people with disabilities because it is intrinsically\ndiscriminatory.\n\nAlthough Asch and others are certainly not attacking a straw person\nposition, the response might be that there is an empirical basis for\nthe claim that disability adversely affects the capacity to benefit\nfrom a health resource, namely the evidence that people with\ndisabilities tend to enjoy less quality of life improvement from these\nresources than those without disabilities. The strength of this\nrejoinder, however, depends very much on what is meant by\n\u201cquality of life\u201d. If understood as a subjective\nassessment or evaluation of one\u2019s life\u2014now more often\ncalled \u201csubjective well-being\u201d (Kahneman, Diener &\nSchwarz 1999)\u2014then there is good empirical evidence that\ndisability does not negatively affect capacity to\nbenefit. People with disabilities tend to be happier, and assess their\nlives to be of considerably higher value than would be objectively\nassumed\u2014a phenomenon called the \u201cdisability paradox\u201d\n(Albrecht & Devlieger 1999). \n\nThis may be granted, but it remains true that bioethicists who rely on\nthe notion of \u201cquality of life\u201d in this context tend to\nassume, usually without argument, that quality of life is an objective\nphenomenon that incorporates autonomy, accomplishments and a\nreasonable array of opportunities to live a full life (see, e.g.,\nBrock 1995, 2005). It is, of course, this objective sense that QALYs\nwas intended to quantify by means of evaluations of health states,\neither by population or expert ranking, or by means of preference\nelicitation techniques. Invariably these ranking exercises show that\nquality of life decreases directly with the severity of the disabling\ncondition.\n\nThe disability advocate might respond that QALYs and similar measures\nare simply not valid since the rankings are done by people who do not\nthemselves have first-hand experience with what it means to live with\na disability. Indeed there is some evidence that third-party\nassessments of the objective quality of life of people with\nimpairments\u2014either by health professionals or the general\npublic\u2014are systematically lower than self-assessments by people\nwith impairments (Ubel et al. 2003), and that this bias may well be\nthe result of distortion from cultural and other prejudices (Amundson\n2010).\n\nAgainst this it might be argued that whether or not a person with a\ndisability is in an epistemically-privileged position concerning the\nexperience of disability, this privilege need not extend to an\nobjective assessment of the actual physical and other burdens of\nliving with the disability (Brock 1995). Quite the contrary, because\nof the psychological dynamics of adaptation and adjustment, especially\nafter a traumatic injury, a person with a disability may well be in a\nworse position to assess his or her life objectively. Once adjusted,\nthe disabled person may grossly overestimate the value of living with\nthe disability, which, while perhaps not a bad thing, in this context\nhas the effect of distorting the individual\u2019s health and social\nneeds (Murray 1996; Menzel et al. 2002).\n\nEven if this debate about how QALYs should be developed is resolved,\nthis may have little impact on the dilemma mentioned. If disability\nobjectively reduces quality of life, then the expected overall benefit\nof a health resource will tend to be adversely affected and CEA will\ndisadvantage persons with disabilities; but on the other hand, if not,\nand disability does not impact on the capacity to benefit from a\nhealth resource, then people with disabilities will be disadvantaged\nby the provision of these resources that do not take their\ndisabilities into account. As Amaryta Sen helpfully explains the\npoint, the value of any resource is not constant across a population\nsince some differences between people affect their ability to\n\u201cconvert\u201d the resource into what is value, either\nobjectively, or to them alone (Sen 1999; Ruger 2010). There are\ndifferences between people that make a difference to the value\nextracted from the same resource, and disability is perhaps the\nclearest example of such a difference.\n\nThe QALY metric, however, is problematic for another reason. When\nevaluators are asked to rank the impact of a disability on quality of\nlife they are asked to consider the overall \u201cburden\u201d of\nliving with that decrement in health or functioning. Undoubtedly, part\nof that burden is the result of the social stigma, discrimination and\nlack of opportunities that characterizes the disabled life, in all\ncultures. People with disabilities typically have as a group the\nlowest employment and education participation rates of any\nsub-population (WHO 2011, Chapter 8), a fact that profoundly affects their quality of life,\nbut which has as much to do with failed policy to combat stigma and\nlack of accommodation as it does with the underlying health condition.\nYet the fact that the burden of living with a disability is caused as\nmuch by the social environment suggests that the QALY metric, even if\nit accurately describes the burden of disability, is unfair as a basis\nfor resource allocation (Wasserman, Asch, Bickenbach 2008). In effect\nwe are saying to the person with a disability that because stigma and\nfailed policy make your life less valuable, we are not going to\nimprove your life by giving you access to needed resources.\n\nOne of the most robust defenses of how the CEA approach deals with\ndisability comes in the form of Michael Stein\u2019s general defense\nof utilitarianism against forms of resource egalitarianism (Stein\n2006). Stein argues that only utilitarianism, by relying on the\ngreater benefit criterion of distributive justice, can handle our\nintuitions about disability when it comes to health care allocation.\nHe acknowledges that disability is conceptually related to ill-health\nor functional decrement (impairment), and, as a utilitarian takes that\nto mean that disability also reduces welfare\u2014and\nproportionately: the more severe the disability, the greater the\nwelfare loss. Because of this relationship, he argues that the\nutilitarian can precisely determine\u2014in welfare terms\u2014the\nimpact of a health benefit and this makes utilitarianism, overall, a\nfar better decision-making method for health care allocations.\nUnfortunately, on his own utilitarian terms, Stein\u2019s argument is\nflawed. For, as we have said, as long as welfare is a subjective\nnotion, there is no reason to think that there is a strict correlation\nbetween health and welfare deficit. Moreover, for a utilitarian\nconsequentialist, there is no a priori reason to think that a\nperson without a disability always experiences less welfare benefit\nthan a person with disability\u2014since there are domains other than\nhealth that impact welfare. On the other hand, if we are concerned\nabout maximizing welfare, rather than health, then we need to take\ninto account all consequential welfare advances that are linked to\nhealth improvements (opportunity to develop talents, better job\nprospects, or a more stable family life) and once that door is open,\nthere is no reason to think that disability will matter since these\nbenefits may, overall, greatly overwhelm the negative impact of\ndisability (Bickenbach 2008). \n\n3.3 Resolving the dilemma: moving beyond CEA\n\nThe dilemma created by the cost-effectiveness strategy, or more\ngenerally a utilitarian approach, may be argued to reflect the\nperennial conflict in distributive justice between \u201cfair\nchances\u201d and \u201cbest outcomes\u201d. Although there are\ndiehard utilitarians like Stein, most philosophers are drawn to the\nview that we must in light of these problems find compromise positions\nin which cost efficiency is moderated by some countervailing principle\nof fairness. Although the debate is about how to construct a social\npolicy of health care allocation\u2014which potentially affects\neveryone, so that everyone\u2019s interests need to be taken into\naccount\u2014this does not mean that the three presumptions mentioned\nabove are rejected. No participant in this debate would argue that\ncosts do not matter, that effective use of resources is irrelevant, or\nthat health care outcomes are wholly subjective and incommensurable.\nInstead, we need to make allocation decision-making more complex by\ntaking account of egalitarian \u201cside constraints\u201d that\nmight modify our CEA results.\n\nThus some philosophers have argued that the debate needs to be infused\nwith the basic egalitarian principle of equal concern and respect, a\nprinciple that may from time to time trump CEA considerations.\nSometimes, that is, \u201cbest outcomes\u201d needs to be moderated\nby \u201cfair chances\u201d. Dan Brock, who was the first to raise\nthe question of how disability impacts on health care allocation,\nargued that the best way forward is to structure health resource\nallocation to secure, to the greatest extent, equality of opportunity\nfor all (Brock 1995). Relocating the center of gravity of health care\nallocation to equality of opportunity was extremely appealing since it\naccorded with the a prominent view about the nature of health, and the\nvalue of health care, most clearly articulated by Norman Daniels\n(1985, and further developed in Daniels 2008). Health, Daniels argued,\nhas a special moral significance for us because it facilitates and\nenhances our full range of opportunities in life, so ensuring that equality\nof health care is one of society\u2019s most effective means of\nensuring equality of opportunity across the board.\n\nYet it was not clear how a renewed emphasis on \u201cfair\nchances\u201d helps to resolve the dilemma that CEA purportedly\ncreates. Even if a purely \u201cbest outcome\u201d approach\ndisadvantages people with disabilities, focusing on \u201cfair\noutcomes\u201d would not mean that we ignored differences in costs\nand capacity to benefit created by disability. One might argue that,\nas abstracted individuals, everyone should have an equal opportunity\nto benefit from health care resources, ceteris paribus. Yet,\nas it is irrational to ignore issues of cost and benefit, it is clear\nthat disability is just the paradigm example of a consideration that\ndisrupts the ceteris paribus assumption. People with\ndisabilities cannot fairly be denied the opportunity to benefit from\nhealth care, but on rational and relevant grounds of cost and prospect\nof benefit, they can fairly be denied health care, at least on a case\nby case basis. Brock came to realize that the move to egalitarian\nequality of opportunity could not resolve the dilemma posed by the\nrelevance of disability in health care rationing. After nearly three\ndecades of work he acknowledged that the problem of seemingly\njustifiable disability discrimination \u201crepresents a deep and\nunresolved problem for resource prioritization\u201d (Brock 2002) and\n\u201cthere is much work still to be done\u201d (Brock 2009). \n\nFor his part, Daniels has argued that when it comes to health resource\ndecisions our fundamental intuitions are permanently at odds and\negalitarian theory cannot help. Our only solution is to ensure that\nour health resource allocation policy is formalized so that all\ndecisions are firmly grounded on fair deliberative processes, in which\nevery voice and argument is heard and decisions are made by a fair and\nneutral arbiter (Daniels, et al. 2000; Daniels 2008).\n\nSearching for an egalitarian allocation principle that might avoid the\ndilemma, some philosophers have gone back to the priority problem\nmentioned above and noted that, depending on the severity of the\ndisability, a person with disabilities may have a greater need for\nhealth resources than a non-disabled individual, or that the health\nresource may have a more profound impact on securing equality of\nopportunity for the disabled person. Making the case for allocation in\nterms of who is \u201cworst off\u201d reflects the version of\negalitarianism called prioritarianism (see Parfit 1997; Arneson 2000)\nin which the distribution of a resource is guided by the intuition\nthat the worst off have more to gain and should be given priority,\nnot, like in the utilitarian approach in terms of great welfare\nbenefit, but because of greater need.\n\nThe prioritarian, however, has two impressive hurdles to overcome: how\nto determine, in health terms, who is \u201cworse off\u201d, and\nsecondly a version of the indirect benefits problem: why should we\nrestrict our focus on health when health resources have knock-on\nbenefits that go far beyond the sphere of health, including becoming a\nproductive member of society. Both issues turn in part on whether\nhealth is an intrinsic or an instrumental good (or both). If purely\ninstrumental, then the value of a health improvement\u2014and so an\nestimate of how worse off a person would be without that\nimprovement\u2014can only be determined by looking at the resulting\nconsequences for the individual and society. Moving in this direction\na wide range of considerations\u2014social position, income level,\ninnate talents and good luck\u2014would be determinative, even though\nthey have very little to do with the health benefit itself. If health\nis only intrinsically valuable, then we would need a direct,\nunidimensional and comparative metric of health-related disadvantage.\nThis is a formidable challenge since, once again, it would require\nanswers to imponderable questions such as \u201cIs a person who is\nblind \u2018worse off\u201d than a person who is deaf?\u2019\n\nRecently, Greg Bognar, recalling a version of \u201cluck\negalitarianism\u201d (see Arneson 2000) has suggested another tactic\nthat might avoid this tangle (Bognar 2010, 2011). Trading on the\ndistinction between the value of a life and its moral worth, he has\nargued that we are uncomfortable with the quality of life measure, not\nbecause it is irrelevant to the capacity to benefit from a health\nresource, but because it tells us nothing about whether the individual\ndeserves or merits the scarce resource. He suggests that in general we\nshould ignore disability in the allocation of health resources.\nDisability is only relevant, he claims, when it diminishes the\ncapacity to benefit from the health resource and the individual is\nresponsible for the disability. Thus, while it would be unjust to deny\na person a hip and knee replacement just because he or she is blind\nbecause of bad luck, it would not seem to be unjust if the person was\nvoluntarily obese: being overweight contributed to the need for the\nreplacement surgery in the first place, and would in any event reduce\nthe benefit that the person would receive from the surgery. \n\nAlthough an intriguing theoretical take on the problem, Bognar\u2019s\nsolution, like all forms of luck egalitarianism, is fraught with a\nvery practical problem of distinguishing causal responsibility from\nmoral responsibility. We may feel confident blaming the excessive\ndrinker for the medical need of a liver transplant, but only if we are\nequally confident that drinking was a choice, rather than a\ngenetically predisposed behavior. And how far back in the causal\nhistory do we need to go to determine innocence or guilt? Most\ntraumatic spinal cord injuries are the result of risky behaviors, and\nthe soldier who voluntarily enlists surely understands the risks. Even\nassuming that these investigations into blameworthiness could\nconceivably be resolved, and resolved in a timely and inexpensive\nmanner, Bognar is not offering a feasible solution to healthcare\nallocation in practice since ignoring blameworthy disability when\nallocating resources is not only unfair, but impractical since\ndisabilities need to be taken into account in order to ensure that\ntreatments and other medical interventions are as appropriate and\nbeneficial for people with disabilities as for those without.\n3.4 Health resource prioritization and the human right to health care\n\nIs the ethical character of health care rationing fundamentally\naltered if we posit a human right to health care for persons with\ndisabilities, as has been recently done by the United Nations\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN\n2007: Articles 25 and 26)? Does human rights discourse strengthen the\nargument that health resource rationing cannot disadvantage persons\nwith disabilities? Does it put more pressure on the need to ethically\njustify the application of cost effectiveness to allocation decision\nmaking? Does it help us resolve the dilemma that disability poses for\nhealth care allocation?\n\nThe Convention explicitly asserts that all of its specific\nsubstantive rights\u2014to health care, education, employment and so\non\u2014are rooted in the protection of equality (or prohibition of\ndiscrimination) and human dignity. This would suggest that if health\nresource allocation was prejudicial or discriminatory against people\nwith disabilities, it would be a clear human rights violation. This\nassessment would hold whether the people with disabilities were\ndisadvantaged directly and individually from \u201cbedside\nallocation\u201d or indirectly because of the application of\notherwise disability-neutral private or public health care funding\narrangements, or health care allocation policies or strategies.\n\nUnfortunately, the language of human rights adds little to the\ndisability advocate\u2019s already strong argument against ex\nante prejudice or stigma in rationing decision-making, an\nargument that has no impact on the larger problem posed by the dilemma\nof whether disability should matter, and if so, how it should matter.\nIn the case of the UN Convention, the human rights posited\nare not special rights restricted to persons with disabilities, rights\nthat would, for example, directly impact health resource allocation so\nas to favor, or not disfavor, persons with disabilities. On the\ncontrary, the right to health resources is explicitly said to be a\nright to \u201cthe same range, quality and standard of care as\nprovided to other persons\u201d. As long as persons with disabilities\nare treated equally with everyone else in a rationing\nscheme\u2014subject to the same strategy of CEA or egalitarian\nprinciple and augmented with the same measure of benefit\u2014then,\narguably, no human right has been violated. In the context of\ninternational human rights, in short, equality of worth, dignity and\nrespect demands, not special treatment or even equal treatment, but\ntreatment as an equal. It would be as unfair, from this perspective,\nto say that the disability is determinative of health resource\nallocation as it would to say that disability is irrelevant. The\ndilemma, in short, remains.\n4. A persistent dilemma?\n\nCurrently, the dilemma posed by whether, and how, disability should be\ntaken into account for health allocation remains unsolved, although it\nfrequently appears in the distributive justice literature as a test\ncase for some variant of egalitarianism or a refined version of CEA.\nEven if the dilemma is resolved, additional problems arise. If we\ndecide that disability is always a relevant allocation consideration,\nthen on the way to tackling the larger question of what the impact of\ndisability should be the question of comparability of varieties of\ndisability looms larger. It has recently been suggested that the\nso-called \u201cindexing problem\u201d created by the\nincommensurable components of human disadvantage (Woff and De-Shalit\n2007), which\nprevents any meaningful comparison between people experiencing very\ndifferent forms of social disadvantage is compounded when trying to\ncompare people with different disabilities. Comparing lower body\nparalysis with deafness is hard enough, but two people both of whom\nare paraplegic may experience it in vastly different ways depending on\nthe availability of wheelchairs and accommodations such as accessible\npublic buildings (Riddle 2014). If we decide that disability should\nnever matter, then it is difficult to see why any consideration of\neither cost or benefit, unrelated to disability, could also be\njustified. If so, then the only survivable allocation procedure would\nbe random allocation, which is highly counter-intuitive as a solution\nto head-to-head individual allocation decisions, let alone a general\nallocation policy. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albrecht, G.A. and P.J.
