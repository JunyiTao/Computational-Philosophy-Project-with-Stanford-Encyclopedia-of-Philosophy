The Persistence of Design Thinking\n\nThat question is: why do design arguments remain so durable if\nempirical evidence is inferentially ambiguous, the arguments logically\ncontroversial, and the conclusions vociferously disputed? One\npossibility is that they really are better arguments than most\nphilosophical critics concede. Another possibility is that design\nintuitions do not rest upon inferences at all. The situation\nmay parallel that of the existence of an external world, the existence\nof other minds, and a number of other familiar matters. The 18th\ncentury Scottish Common Sense philosopher Thomas Reid (and his\ncontemporary followers) argued that we are simply so constructed that\nin certain normally-realized experiential circumstances we simply\nfind that we in fact have involuntary convictions about such\na world, about other minds, and so forth. That would explain why\nhistorical philosophical attempts to reconstruct the\narguments by which such beliefs either arose or were justified were\nsuch notorious failures\u2014failures in the face of which ordinary\nbelief nonetheless proceeded happily and helplessly onward. If a\nsimilar involuntary belief-producing mechanism operated with respect\nto intuitions of design, that would similarly explain why\nargumentative attempts have been less than universally compelling but\nyet why design ideas fail to disappear despite the purported failure\nof such arguments.\n\nA number of prominent figures historically in fact held that we could\ndetermine more or less perceptually that various things in nature were\ncandidates for design attributions\u2014that they were in the\nrequisite respects design-like. Some, like William Whewell,\nheld that we could perceptually identify some things as more than mere\ncandidates for design (1834, 344). Thomas Reid also held a view in\nthis\n region,[13]\n as did Hume\u2019s Cleanthes, and, more recently, Alvin Plantinga\n(2011, 263\u2013264).\n\nIf something like that were the operative process, then ID, in trying\nto forge a scientific link to design in the sense of\ninferences from empirically determined evidences would be\nmisconstructing the actual basis for design belief, as would be design\narguments more generally. It is perhaps telling, in this regard, that\nscientific theorizing typically involves substantial creativity and\nthat the resultant theories are typically novel and unexpected. Design\nintuitions, however, do not seem to emerge as novel construals from\ncreative grappling with data, but are embedded in our thinking nearly\nnaturally\u2014so much so that, again, Crick thinks that biologists\nhave to be immunized against it.\n",
