    "main_text": "Introduction and History || What Are Experiments?\n1.1 What Are Experiments?\n\nAs the examples discussed above reveal, a variety of types of\nempirical evidence are useful to moral theorizing (see also the\nentries on empirical moral psychology, empirical distributive justice,\nand empirical psychology and character). Anthropological observation\nand data have long played a role in moral philosophy. The\ntwentieth-century moral philosophers John Ladd and Richard Brandt\ninvestigated moral relativism in part by conducting their own\nethnographies in Native American communities. Brandt writes, \u201cWe\nhave\u2026 a question affecting the truth of ethical relativism\nwhich, conceivably, anthropology can help us settle. Does ethnological\nevidence support the view that \u201dqualified persons\u201c can\ndisagree in ethical attitude?\u201d But, he notes, \u201csome kinds\nof anthropological material will not help us\u2014in particular, bare\ninformation about intercultural differences in ethical opinion or\nattitude.\u201d (1952: 238). This is a caveat frequently cited by\nphilosophers engaged in empirical research: it is important to have\nphilosophers participate in experimental design and the gathering of\nempirical data, because there are certain questions that must be\naddressed for the data to have philosophical applications\u2014in\nthis case, whether moral disagreements involve different factual\nbeliefs or other non-moral differences. Barry Hallen (1986, 2000)\nconducted a series of interviews and ethnographies among the Yoruba,\ninvestigating central evaluative concepts and language relating to\nepistemology, aesthetics, and moral value. Hallen was motivated by\nquestions about the indeterminacy of translation, but his work\nprovides an example of how in-depth interviews can inform\ninvestigations of philosophical concepts.\n\nThese examples show that ethnography has a valuable role to play in\nphilosophical theory, but the remainder of this entry will focus\nprimarily on experiments. Paradigmatic experiments involve randomized\nassignment to varying conditions of objects or people from a random\nsample, followed by statistical comparison of the outcomes for each\ncondition. The variation in conditions is sometimes called a\nmanipulation. For example, an experimenter might select a random\nsample of people, randomly assign them either to find or not to find a\ndime in the coin return of a pay phone, and then measure the degree to\nwhich they subsequently help someone they take to be in need (Isen\n& Levin 1972). Finding or not finding the dime is the condition;\ndegree of helpfulness is the outcome variable.\n\nWhile true experiments follow this procedure, other types of studies\nallow non-random assignment to conditions. Astronomers, for example,\nsometimes speak of natural experiments. Although we are in no position\nto affect the motions of heavenly bodies, we can observe them under a\nvariety of conditions, over long periods of time, and with a variety\nof instruments. Likewise, anthropological investigation of different\ncultures\u2019 moral beliefs and practices is unlikely to involve\nmanipulating variables in the lives of the members of the culture, but\nsuch studies are valuable and empirically respectable. Still,\ninferring causation is more difficult with such studies, so the\nevidential value of these studies is often less than that of\nexperiments, at least in this respect; most published research in\nexperimental philosophy involves true experiments.\n\nEven within the category of experiments, we find a lot of diversity\nwith respect to inputs, methods of measurement, and outputs. The\nexperiment just described uses a behavioral measure and\nmanipulation\u2014finding the dime is the input, helping is the\noutcome measured. Other experiments measure not behavior but judgment\nor intuition, and this can be done using a survey or other form of\nself\u2013report or informant\u2013report where subjects respond\nexplicitly to some question, situation, or dilemma. Studies measuring\njudgments might use either manipulations of the condition in which the\nsubject makes the judgment, or they might look for correlations\nbetween judgments and some other factor, such as brain activity,\nemotional response, reaction time, visual attention, and so on\n(Strohminger et al. 2014).\n\nThe experimental methods available have also changed over time.\nSurveys have been the dominant method of experimental philosophy for\nthe past few decades, but technology may change this: advances in\nvirtual and augmented reality mean that philosophers can now immerse\npeople in moral dilemmas such as Thompson\u2019s (1971) violinist\nthought experiment and different versions of the trolley problem\n(e.g., Navarrete et al 2012). Philosophers interested in the neural\ncorrelates of moral judgment can use transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS) to investigate the effects of enhancing or lessening activity in\ncertain areas of the brain. Even survey methods have seen advances\nthanks to technology; the ubiquity of smartphones allows researchers\nto ping people in real time, asking for reports on mood (see section\n3.2 below for a discussion of surveys relating to happiness and\nmood).\n\nWhether experimental moral philosophy has to use true experiments or\ncan include studies and even ethnographies and other forms of\nqualitative data is partly a terminological question about how to\ndefine the field and whether we distinguish it from empirical moral\npsychology, a closely related research program. As we will see below,\nthough, a diversity of both methods and subjects is important in\nhelping experimental moral philosophy respond to its critics.\n",
