    "main_text": "Life, Works, and Philosophical Affiliation || Works of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n1.3 Works of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n\nThe only preserved work of Jayar\u0101\u015bi is the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha (\u2018The Lion [Destroying] the\nDelusion of Categories\u2019, often interpreted as \u2018The Lion of\nthe Dissolution of [all] Categories\u2019 or \u2018The Lion which\nAnnihilates [all] Principles\u2019). Its palm leaf manuscript was\ndiscovered in 1926 in a manuscript library at Patan by\nSukhl\u0101lj\u012b Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b and Rasikl\u0101l C.\nP\u0101r\u012bkh, and the text remained virtually unknown until its\npublication in 1940.\n\nThe work was quite well known in mediaeval philosophical milieu, both\nin the South and North of India, but hardly ever treated in a way a\nserious and original philosophical treatise deserves: Indian\nphilosophers of established traditions do not, as a rule, refer to the\nwork directly or refute its contents, not to mention any attempt at\nthe providing a genuine appraisal of the work or entering into\ndiscussion with its author. They simply ignored it.\n\nTwo reasons might be mentioned for such a situation. First, Indian\nphilosophers did not principally engage in discussions with\nrepresentatives of the materialist school, except for standardised\ndismissive refutations of a few basic materialist theories, which are\nmentioned by Indian philosophers in their works in order to render a\n\u2018complete\u2019 picture of the philosophical spectrum. These\nstandardised, habitually repeated refutations were not applicable to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, who was not a typical representative of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school. New powerful philosophical\nmachinery would have to be applied to engage in a discussion with\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. And that is precisely the second reason: the\narguments Jayar\u0101\u015bi consistently applies, his rigid and\ncoherent lines of argumentation proved to be an extremely hard piece\nof cake to swallow for those whose views he criticised. It seems,\ntherefore, that the general approach of Indian philosophers\nvis-\u00e0-vis Jayar\u0101\u015bi was that of disregard and failure\nto notice the weight of his work. A few exceptions can be mentioned\nthough of those who attempted to engage with\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s arguments, notably two Jaina philosophers,\nVidy\u0101nanda and Anantav\u012brya, and a propounder of the\nNy\u0101ya system, Bh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a (Franco (1994:\u00a0\n553\u2013586)). Jayar\u0101\u015bi is occasionally mentioned in a\npositive light when Indian authors acknowledge his powerful method of\ncritical analysis, and these are primarily, or even exclusively, Jaina\nauthors. Sometimes they even refer to Jayar\u0101\u015bi as an expert\nin some fields, e.g. by Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (c. 1229), who says:\n\u2018A refutation of all cognitive criteria in details should be\nconsulted from the Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha\u2019 (SVM,\np.118.1\u20132).\n\nThe text of Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha was preserved without any\ncommentary and it seems that its was never commented upon. We cannot\nsay with absolute certainty whether its author had any followers or\nwhether he established an independent school, but that is not unlikely\nbecause we occasionally come across the expression\ntattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din in the plural: \u2018those who\npropound the dissolution of [all] categories\u2019 in philosophical\nliterature, and across the single term Tattv\u00f4paplava used as if\nit denoted a separate school.\n\nIt is not certain whether Jayar\u0101\u015bi composed any other work.\nHe himself refers to a treatise entitled Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra\n(\u2018The Quintessence of the Definition [of Cognitive Criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a)]\u2019) on one occasion, while refuting the\nusage of the term \u2018non-verbal\u2019 (avyapade\u015bya) in the\ndefinition of the cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a, or\n\u2018veridical instrument of knowledge\u2019) of the Ny\u0101ya\nschool. There, he says that the inapplicability of the term has\nalready been shown in the Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra and one should\nconsult that work. It is highly probable that he indeed refers to his\nown text for the simple reason that he generally does not mention any\nworks of any other authors either in support of his own views or in\nfavourable light, except for the materialist teacher B\u1e5bhaspati\nand his B\u1e5bhaspati-s\u016btra. Still, it is not impossible that\nthe text he referred to under the title Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-s\u0101ra\nmight have been penned by another representative of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school who had been held in esteem\nby Jayar\u0101\u015bi, e.g. his own guru.\n",
