    "main_text": "\n\nThe developments of set theory in 1960's led to an era of independence\nin which many of the central questions were shown to be unresolvable\non the basis of the standard system of mathematics, ZFC. This is true\nof statements from areas as diverse as analysis (\u201cAre all\nprojective sets Lebesgue measurable?\u201d), cardinal arithmetic\n(\u201cDoes Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis (CH) hold?\u201d),\ncombinatorics (\u201cDoes Suslin's Hypotheses hold?\u201d), and\ngroup theory (\u201cIs there a Whitehead group?\u201d). \n\n These developments gave rise to two conflicting positions. The\nfirst position\u2014which we shall\ncall pluralism\u2014maintains that the independence results\nlargely undermine the enterprise of set theory as an objective\nenterprise. On this view, although there are practical\nreasons that one might give in favour of one set of axioms over\nanother\u2014say, that it is more useful for a given task\u2014,\nthere are no theoretical reasons that can be given; and,\nmoreover, this either implies or is a consequence of the\nfact\u2014depending on the variant of the view, in particular,\nwhether it places realism before reason, or conversely\u2014that\nthere is no objective mathematical realm at this level. The second\nposition\u2014which we shall\ncall non-pluralism\u2014maintains that the independence\nresults merely indicate the paucity of our standard resources for\njustifying mathematical statements. On this view, theoretical\nreasons can be given for new axioms and\u2014again,\ndepending on the variant of the view\u2014this either implies or is a\nconsequence of the fact that there is an objective mathematical realm\nat this level. \n\n The theoretical reasons for new axioms that the non-pluralist\ngives are quite different that the theoretical reasons that are\ncustomarily at play in mathematics, in part because, having stepped\ninto the realm of independence, a more subtle form of justification is\nrequired, one that relies more heavily on sophisticated mathematical\nmachinery. The dispute between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is\nthus one that lies at the intersection of philosophy and\nmathematics\u2014on the one hand, it is intimately connected with\nsome of the central questions of philosophy of mathematics, such as\nthe question of realism and the nature of justification; on the other\nhand, it addresses these questions in a manner that is sensitive to a\ngreat deal of sophisticated mathematics. \n\n The debate between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is really a\nhierarchy of debates. At the one extreme there is pluralism with\nregard to all of mathematics and at the other extreme there\nis non-pluralism with regard to all of mathematics. The\nintermediate positions (which are much more common) involve embracing\nnon-pluralism for certain domains (say first-order arithmetic), while\nadvocating pluralism with regard to others (say those where the notion\nof the full powerset enters the picture). Fortunately, the\nmathematical systems that arise in practice can be arranged in a\nwell-founded hierarchy\u2014ranging from weak systems like Robinson's\narithmetic Q, up through Peano arithmetic PA, the subsystems of\nsecond-order arithmetic, the subsystems of set theory, and the\nhierarchy of large cardinal axioms. One can thus arrange the hybrid\nnon-pluralist/pluralist positions and the corresponding debates in a\nwell-founded hierarchy, where along the way one embraces more and more\nnon-pluralism. The challenge for those with non-pluralist tendencies\nis to make the case that non-pluralism extends further and further\ninto the upper reaches of higher mathematics. The challenge for those\nwith pluralist tendencies is to draw the line in a principled manner\nand make the case that no argument for non-pluralism will succeed for\nthe domains of mathematics beyond that line. \n\n It is sensible to approach the search for new axioms and the\nquestion of pluralism in a stepwise fashion, seeking first axioms that\nresolve certain low-level questions and making the case for\nnon-pluralism at that level, and then proceeding upward to questions\nof greater complexity and the question of pluralism at higher\nlevels. The present entry focuses on this debate as it takes place in\nthe setting of classical descriptive set theory. There are\nthree reasons for this choice. First, a popular view embraces\nnon-pluralism for first-order arithmetic but rejects the search for\nnew axioms for full second-order arithmetic and set theory and\nembraces pluralism at these \n levels.[1] \n The questions of descriptive set theory are\nimportant in this connection since many of them are statements of\nsecond-order arithmetic which are independent of the standard axioms,\nZFC. It thus represents a critical juncture in the debate between the\npluralist and non-pluralist. Second, here the mathematical landscape\nwith regard to the implications of new axioms has largely stabilized\nand we now have the resources required to address the issue between\nthe pluralist and the non-pluralist. (In the case of questions of\nthird- and higher-order arithmetic the matter still awaits further\nmathematical developments. That topic is treated in the entry\n \u201cThe Continuum Hypothesis\u201d.)  \nFinally, the case for new axioms at this level involves so-called\n\u201cextrinsic justifications\u201d (something we shall describe\nbelow) and, moreover, provides the strongest current example of such\njustifications. \n\n Here is an overview of the present\nentry: Section 1 provides further philosophical\nmotivation and sharpens the question of pluralism by briefly\ndiscussing the interpretability hierarchy, the incompleteness\nphenomenon, and the nature of axioms.\n Section 2\n describes the central notions and results of classical\ndescriptive set theory along with the independence results concerning\nthe questions that remained open and were ultimately shown to be\nunresolvable on the basis of the standard axioms,\nZFC. Section 3 describes the two main\napproaches to new axioms\u2014axioms of definable determinacy and\nlarge cardinal axioms\u2014and discusses the implications of these\naxioms for the undecided questions of classical descriptive set\ntheory. Section 4 treats of the intimate\nrelationship between the two approaches and outlines the case that has\nbeen made for axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal\naxioms. Section 5 revisits the debate between\nthe pluralist and the non-pluralist in light of the foregoing\nmathematical developments. \n",
