Hart\u2019s Critique\n\nThe most famous post-war critique of international law\u2019s legal\ncharacter is Chapter X of H.L.A. Hart\u2019s The Concept of\nLaw. Hart was not an outright sceptic about the legal character\nof international law, saying we should \u201cneither dismiss the\ndoubt we may feel\u2026 nor shall we simply confirm them\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 214]). However, he did think international law was\nimpaired in its law-like character by the fact that\n\n\nthe rules for states resemble that simple form of social structure,\nconsisting only of primary rules of obligation, which, when we find it\namong societies of individuals, we are accustomed to contrast to a\ndeveloped legal system. (Hart 1961 [2012: 214])\n\n\nThe resemblance is \u201cin form though not at all in content\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 232]), given the discrepancy between the content of\nobligations typically imposed by domestic legal systems and those\nimposed by international law.\n\nThe main problem with international law, according to Hart, is that it\nlacks secondary rules. This means it is not law in a modern developed\nsense, but in a simple or primitive one. In Hart\u2019s well-known\nconception, a legal system is a union of two sets of rules: primary\nrules which impose obligations, and secondary rules which are rules\nabout rules, relating to the way in which those primary rules are\nidentified, changed and adjudicated\n upon.[2]\n Hart argues that international law possesses primary rules which are\nfor the most part observed in practice. International law however\nlacks that distinctive secondary rule which Hart calls the the rule of\nrecognition, that is a rule that does not depend for its existence on\nother rules and provides the ultimate foundation on which the legal\nsystem depends.\n\nThese defects, Hart says, make international law not law in the modern\nsense, but law only in a primitive or incomplete sense. Hart\u2019s\ncharacterization of international law as primitive law is a poor fit\nwith his own view of primitive law as law suitable for\n\n\na small community closely knit by ties of kinship, common sentiment,\nand belief, and placed in a stable environment. (Hart 1961 [2012:\n92])\n\n\nThe context in which international law operates is quite different:\nthe total number of States (fewer than 200) would fit the notion of\nsmall community, but the small community of States has none of the\nsocial ties that characterize the communities in which primitive law\noperates.\n\nA typical retort among international lawyers to Hart\u2019s critique\nis that these are just matters of definition. But this answer misses\nthe distinction between terminological and conceptual disagreement.\nHart\u2019s conceptual critique of international law raises crucial\nquestions about its legal character. As Hart himself understood, a\nfailure to conceptualize the social phenomenon that we normally\ndescribe as international law does matter, for it hinders both\n\u201ctheoretical enquiries \u2026 [and] moral deliberation\u201d\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 214]). We need to understand what it is that we are\ntalking about if we want to advance moral and political arguments\nabout international law.\n\nMore fundamentally, Hart\u2019s conclusion that international law\nlacks a rule of recognition needs to be tested against the evolving\nrealities since 1961 when The Concept of Law was first\npublished. Hart was not particularly prescriptive about the form of\nthe rule of recognition:\n\n\n[i]t may, as in the early law of many societies, be no more than that\nan authoritative list or text of the rules is to be found in a written\ndocument or carved on some public monument. (Hart 1961 [2012: 94])\n\n\nBut Hart was dismissive of the possibility that consent or pacta\nsunt servanda could perform such a function: to say\n\u201cinternational law is what states have consented to\u201d or\n\u201cinternational law obligations must be performed\u201d cannot\namount to a rule of recognition.\n\nA promising candidate for the role of secondary rule is the Vienna\nConvention on the Law of Treaties, which is generally understood to\nreflect customary international law. As a treaty about treaties, the\nConvention has come to perform a systemic function by regulating the\nadoption, entry into force, amendment and interpretation of treaties.\nBy providing rules for treaty-making, the Vienna Convention operates\nfor treaties much like the Uniform Commercial Code in the US or the\nCode Civil in France do for contracts. It is, in other words, a set of\nprimary and secondary rules that enables certain promises to have\nlegal effect.\n\nA basic norm to explain the legal character of the Vienna Convention\nmay be Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of\nJustice, a treaty to which all member states of the UN must also be a\nparty. But Article 38 is a treaty provision which, on first\ninspection, does no more than identify the applicable law in disputes\nbrought before the Court. Applicable law clauses are far from\ninfrequent in treaties that provide for judicial settlement of\ndisputes, and their existence supports the non-systemic and episodic\nnature of international law. So in what way can Article 38 be said to\nbe to embody the rule of recognition? Unlike other applicable law\nclauses, Article 38 has come to perform a systemic function, and is\nregularly relied upon by domestic as well as international courts. It\nis foundational at least in an explanatory sense, i.e., as a rule\nabout how \u201cprimary rules may be conclusively ascertained,\nintroduced, eliminated, varied\u201d (Hart 1961 [2012: 94]).\n\nLastly, in the search for a rule of recognition, some have pointed out\nthat features like the inability of states freely to leave the UN, to\ntake one example, have given a constitutional character to\ninternational law. This is not only an exaggeration, but also a\ndistortion of international law\u2014a conceptual over-correction of\nnot treating international law as properly law. Features such as the\nnon-denunciability of the UN Charter do however tell us something\nimportant about the nature of international law: they may evidence a\ndistinctive constitutive force from which international law derives\nfull legal character.\n\nThe above responses to Hart\u2019s ambivalence about the legal status\nof international law has granted his premise that a full-fledged legal\nsystem requires a rule of recognition. Even on this basis, critics\nlike Jeremy Waldron have rejected his \u201cvery poor\u201d\narguments for a qualified scepticism about the legal character of\ninternational law (Waldron 2014: 213). However, Hart\u2019s leading\ncritic, Ronald Dworkin, contested this premise itself. According to\nDworkin, the determination of law is not ultimately grounded in a\nsocial rule\u2014a rule of recognition\u2014widely accepted by\nofficials and others as the right standard for identifying\nlaw. Instead, legal requirements emerge through a process of\n\u201cconstructive interpretation\u201d that requires the\ninterpreter to discern the set of underlying moral-political\nprinciples that best fit and justify the relevant\nlegal materials, e.g., in the case of international law, the raw data\nof treaties, state practice, opinio juris, international\ndeclarations, etc. (Dworkin 1986). Unlike Hart, Dworkin\u2019s view\nof international law is part of his theoretical ambitions to establish\nthat genuine law is morally binding on its subjects (see\n section 4\n on Legitimacy).\n",
