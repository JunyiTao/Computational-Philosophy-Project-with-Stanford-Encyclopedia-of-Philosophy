    "main_text": "The epistemic function of conscience || Conscience as a faculty for indirect moral knowledge\n3.1 Conscience as a faculty for indirect moral knowledge\n\nIn the Christian tradition, starting from Paul, the inward looking\ncharacter of conscience is emphasized by the metaphor of the witness\n(Romans 2: 14\u201315). Conscience does not allow us to acquire the\nknowledge of the moral law directly from an external source (God in\nthis case), but only to witness the presence of God\u2019s laws\nwithin us. Conscience cannot directly contemplate God. The idea of a\nfaculty that gives us indirect, and therefore imperfect knowledge of\nsome external moral authority suits religious traditions very well.\nFor example, the idea that through conscience we discover the true\ndivine laws can also be found in Islam (Geaves 1999: 164).\n\nIt is important to note that also in this case, as in the previous\nunderstanding of conscience as self-awareness and self-assessment,\nconscience can be conceived as fulfilling an introspective function,\ni.e., as being directed towards the self and towards\none\u2019s own mental states. Introspection allows one to gain\nself-knowledge (Schwitzgebel 2014), but since the self which is\nobserved contains the moral law, it is possible to say that the law\nitself, as part of our self, becomes the object of introspection.\nThus, for instance, in his theological writings before his papacy,\nJoseph Ratzinger said that \u201csomething like an original memory of\nthe good and the true (the two are identical) has been implanted in\nus\u201d, and conscience is \n\n\nso to speak an inner sense, a capacity to recall, so that the one whom\nit addresses, if he is not turned in on himself, hears its echo from\nwithin. (Ratzinger 1991: 535) \n\n\nThe Catholic Church also makes reference to \u201cthe voice of the\nLord echoing in the conscience of every individual\u201d (John Paul\nII 1995: par. 24).\n\nOn this account\u2014since conscience is only a witness and\ndoes not have direct epistemic access to the source of knowledge,\ni.e., to God\u2014conscience is considered fallible and actually\noften erroneous (1 Corinthians 4:4; Aquinas 1265\u20131274; Butler\n1726: sermon 3 (3)). In particular, conscience might fail to correctly\ninterpret the divine laws when applying them to real cases. According\nto some 13th Century Catholic theologians, such as Philip\nthe Chancellor, Albert the Great and, most notably, Thomas Aquinas,\nconscience is the act of applying universal principles (i.e., divine\nlaws) to real situations, i.e., it is the conclusion of the practical\nsyllogism whose first premise is a universal principle provided by a\nseparate faculty called \u201csynderesis\u201d (Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae, 1 q79; Langston 2000 and 2015; Sorabji 2014:\n62\u201366): as such, conscience can be erroneous in deriving moral\nconclusions from first principles (Aquinas, On Truth, q17,\nart. 2, and discussion in D\u2019Arcy 1961: 100\u2013103).\n\nOn a secular account, the external source of moral knowledge that\ninstills moral principles in us is not God, but one\u2019s own\nculture or upbringing. In this case, the moral knowledge in question\nis typically understood in a relativistic sense: our conscience is the\nfaculty through which the social norms of our culture or the norms of\nour upbringing are evoked and exert their influence on our moral\npsychology. These norms explain our moral feelings and our moral\nchoices, but what conscience tells us in this case is the product of\nsocial and cultural dynamics over which we have little control. As the\ncase of Huckleberry Finn\u2019s conscience demonstrates, hardly can\nconscience so understood be credited any moral authority, since our\neducators or our culture might be highly immoral (for example our\nconscience might end up drawing on racist or discriminatory\nprinciples, such as the ones which supported slavery in Huck\u2019s\nsocial environment). And in fact, unsurprisingly, many are rather\nskeptical or dismissive of the moral authority of conscience, since\nthey see it as mere opinion about moral principles influenced or even\ndetermined by one\u2019s own culture (Montaigne 1580: book 1, ch. 22;\nHobbes 1651: ch. 7). In this sense, conscience is a merely\nrelativistic notion whose content changes according to social,\ncultural, and familial circumstances.\n",
