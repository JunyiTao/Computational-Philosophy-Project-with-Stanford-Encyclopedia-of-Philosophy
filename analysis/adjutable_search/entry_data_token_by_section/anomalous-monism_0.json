    "main_text": "The Argument for Anomalous Monism\n1. The Argument for Anomalous Monism\n\nThe basic structure of the argument for Anomalous Monism is as\nfollows. We start with the plausible assumption that some mental\nevents, such as believing that it is raining, are caused by certain\nphysical events, in this case the rain. Similarly, it is assumed that\nsome physical events, such as one\u2019s arm rising, are caused by\ncertain mental events, such as deciding to scratch one\u2019s head.\nDavidson calls this the Principle of Causal Interaction; we shall call\nit the interaction principle:\n\n\nThe Interaction Principle: Some mental events causally\ninteract with some physical events\n\n\nDavidson presents this assumption as obvious and not in need of\njustification, but we shall see that motivations for it can be found\nin parts of his writings\n (2.2).\n To this interaction principle is added the requirement that all\nsingular causal interactions are covered by strict laws\u2014laws\nwith fully articulated antecedents which guarantee some fully\narticulated consequence (for caveats and details,\n see 3.1).\n Davidson calls this the Principle of the Nomological Character of\nCausality; we shall call it the cause-law principle:\n\n\nThe Cause-Law Principle: Events related as cause and effect\nare covered by strict laws\n\n\nThis cause-law principle was also initially assumed without argument\nby Davidson, though we shall see below\n (3.2)\n how he later came to try to justify it. Now, the assumptions so far\nseem to point directly to the existence of strict psychophysical\nlaws\u2014if some particular mental event m1 is\ncaused by some particular physical event p1, then,\ngiven the cause-law principle, it seems to follow that there must be a\nstrict law of the form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019.\nThat is, whenever events of kind P1 occur, events\nof kind M1 must follow. However, Davidson then\nclaims that there can be no such laws. He calls this the Principle of\nthe Anomalism of the Mental, and it holds that mental properties are\nnot suitable for inclusion in strict laws of any kind; we shall call\nit the anomalism principle:\n\n\nThe Anomalism Principle: There are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or\nexplained by other events\n\n\nDavidson offered loose ruminations concerning rationality and\nrationalizing explanations, which purportedly constitute the very\nnature of mental properties, in support of the anomalism principle\n (4.2).\n All of this will be discussed in detail below.\n\nWith the interaction principle, the cause-law principle, and the\nanomalism principle now in place, we can see that there is a tension\nin need of resolution. From the interaction and cause-law principles\nit follows that there must be strict laws covering the interaction\nbetween mental and physical events. But the anomalism principle\nentails that there are no strict psychophysical laws. How can all\nthree principles be held simultaneously?\n\nTo resolve the tension, Davidson noted that while the cause-law\nprinciple requires that there be strict covering laws, it\ndoesn\u2019t specify the vocabulary in which those laws must be\nformulated. If particular physical event p1 causes\nparticular mental event m1, and there must be some\nstrict law covering this interaction, but there is no strict law of\nthe form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\nthen there must be some other law,\n\u2018?1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0?2\u2019, which\ncovers the causal relation between p1 and\nm1. That is, m1 and\np1 must instantiate properties suitable for\ninclusion in strict laws; but since we know that\nM1 is not a property of this kind,\nm1 must instantiate some other property.\nDavidson\u2019s ingenious deduction at this point was that this\nproperty must be physical, since only the physical sciences hold out\nthe promise of a closed system of strict laws (Davidson 1970,\n223\u201324; on the notion of a closed system, see\n 5.1\n and the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Monism).\n Therefore, every causally interacting mental event must be\ntoken-identical to some physical event\u2014hence, monism\n (5.1):\n\n\nMonism: Every causally interacting mental event is\ntoken-identical to some physical event\n\n\nIn arguing in this way, Davidson relies upon a key distinction between\nexplanation and causation. While explanation is, intuitively, an\nintensional notion\u2014one sensitive to how events are\ndescribed\u2014causation is extensional, obtaining between pairs of\nevents independently of how they are described. For example, a\nbridge\u2019s collapse is explained by the explosion of a bomb. That\nexplosion, let us suppose, was the most newsworthy event of the day.\nWhile the most newsworthy event of the day caused the\nbridge\u2019s collapse, \u2018the most newsworthy event of the\nday\u2019 does not explain that collapse. Telling someone\nthat it was the most newsworthy event of the day that explained the\nbridge\u2019s collapse wouldn\u2019t provide an explanation\u2014it\nwouldn\u2019t make the bridge\u2019s collapse intelligible to the\naudience\u2014though it would pick out its actual cause. How the\ncause is described is relevant to whether an explanation occurs.\nCauses and effects can be accurately picked out using a variety of\nexpressions, many of which are not explanatory. As we shall see, the\ndistinction between causation and explanation is crucial to Anomalous\nMonism\n (6.1\u20136.3; \nsee also related discussion of the intensionality\nof deterministic relations in \n Related Issues: 3.1 Anomalous Monism and Kant\u2019s Theory of Freedom).\n\n\nFinally, to alleviate certain concerns about the adequacy of the form\nof physicalism he was endorsing, Davidson endorsed a dependency\nrelation of supervenience of the mental on the physical, and claimed\nthat it was consistent with Anomalous Monism\n (5.1,\n 5.3) (Davidson 1970, 214; 1993; 1995a, 266):\n\n\nSupervenience of the Mental on the Physical: if two events\nshare all of their physical properties, they will share all of their\nmental properties\n\n\nIn what follows (2\u20135), each step of this argument will be\nanalyzed and discussed separately, but always with an eye to the\noverall argument. In 6, a central objection to Anomalous\nMonism\u2014that it appears unable to account for the\ncausal/explanatory power of mental events and properties\u2014will be\nexplained and discussed. (For discussion of the relationship between\nAnomalous Monism and two other pillars of Davidson\u2019s\nphilosophy\u2014his rejection of conceptual relativism and commitment\nto semantic externalism\u2014see the supplement on\n Related Issues.)\n",
