    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Cosmology\n5.2 Cosmology\n\nThe notion of \u201cextended-composite\u201d lies at the heart of\nWolff\u2019s doctrine of the world-whole. Cosmology, as a special\nmetaphysical science, is the study of the world-whole in general. The\nworld, as such, is an extended composite of extended composites. In\n\u00a7544 of his German Metaphysics, Wolff explains:\n\n\nThe world is a collection of mutable things that are next to each\nother, follow upon one another, but which are overall connected with\none another.\n\n\nIn precise terms, Wolff believes the world is an extended whole that\nis composed of a finite number of interacting physical bodies. To\nbetter understand the types of cosmological claims that Wolff defends\nabout the universe, it is perhaps helpful to consider first his\nconception of physical bodies. Ultimately, the conclusions that Wolff\ndraws at the macroscopic level about the world-whole are simply\nextrapolated from his analysis of physical bodies. After considering\nWolff\u2019s analysis of body, this section will conclude with an\noverview of Wolff\u2019s view of space, time and material\nextension.\n\nWolff\u2019s analysis of physical bodies is given from two different\nperspectives. First is the \u201cbottom-up\u201d metaphysical\naccount of bodies, where bodies are defined as aggregates of simple\nsubstances, and second is the \u201ctop-down\u201d mechanistic\ndescription, where the reality of bodies, given by the testimony of\nthe senses, is explained in terms of interacting primitive\ncorpusula (or corpuscles). To facilitate our discussion, we\nshould identify the three levels of description that Wolff employs\nwhen giving his two perspective account. Identifying these three\ndifferent levels is helpful in understanding at what respective point\nthe mechanical and metaphysical accounts each terminate or bottom\nout.\n\nThe ground floor (so to speak) is the atomic level that is occupied by\na \u201cmultitude\u201d of simple substances. Unlike simple\nsubstances at the nominal level of reality that lack the \u201cmode\nof existence\u201d, simples at the atomic level are real individuals\n(i.e., complete and determinate, actually existing beings). In\naddition to the term \u201csimples\u201d, Wolff also refers to these\noccupants of the atomic level as \u201celements\u201d and\n\u201catoms of nature\u201d (atomi naturae). Atomic\nelements (as such) are conceived by Wolff to be \u201cunextended\npoints of force\u201d that lack internal motion (motus\nintestinus) but yet remain in a constant state of change. Each\natomic element is defined, or individuated, by its own distinctive\ninternal state and each is considered to be indivisible in-itself.\nAlthough later Wolffians, such as Baumeister, would eventually refer\nto Wolff\u2019s atomic elements as \u201cmonads\u201d, there is at\nleast one important respect in which Wolff\u2019s atomic elements are\ndifferent from Leibniz\u2019s monads (Baumeister 1747: 226). Leibniz\nconceives monads as simple unextended substances, and hence Leibnizian\nmonads are \u201cwindowless\u201d substances that do not interact or\ninfluence one another. Wolff\u2019s atomic elements, in contrast, do\ninteract and have real dynamic influence over each\n other.[4]\n\n\nThe second level of description that Wolff employs when giving his\naccount of bodies is the microphysical level. The occupants of this\nlevel are the primitive parts of bodies which Wolff calls corpuscles\nor material atoms. In \u00a7186 of his Cosmologia, Wolff\nprovides a helpful contrast between atoms of nature, on one hand, and\nmaterial atoms, on the other:\n\n\nThat is called an atom of nature which is indivisible in itself\nbecause it is devoid of parts into which it can be divided. That is\ncalled a material atom which in itself is able to be divided, but for\nactually dividing it, existing causes in rerum natura are not\n adequate.[5]\n\n\nMaterial atoms or corpuscles are indivisible in the sense that there\nis nothing within the world that is capable of reducing them into\nfurther parts. Corpuscles represent the lowest level of explanation\nthat is possible within a mechanical account of bodies. Similar to the\natomic level, the microphysical level lies beyond the boundaries of\nhuman perception. Wolff believes that although corpuscles are\nextended, fill space, and are endowed with the \u201cforce of\ninertia\u201d, a precise statement of their size, magnitude, and\nshape cannot be empirically determined. It is unclear, for example,\nwhether all corpuscles retain homogeneity with respect to their\nmagnitude and shape. Yet because corpuscles are a species of composite\nbeings, Wolff is confident that the essence of a corpuscle consists in\nthe manner in which its parts are joined together. A corpuscle is an\naggregate of atomic elements. Its component parts are simply the\nunextended points of force that occupy the atomic level.\n\nThe third level of description that Wolff employs when giving his\naccount of bodies is the level of appearance or sensible reality. It\nis at this level that bodies and their phenomenal properties, such as\nextension, the force of inertia, and motor force (vis\nmotrix), are described in mechanistic terms. In \u00a7793 of his\nOntologia, Wolff writes:\n\n\nI prefer that aggregates of simple substances, namely, those compound\nbeings of which the material world is composed, be called bodies\nrather than simple substances\u2026\n\n\nIn a strict sense, a body is considered by Wolff to be a composite of\ncomposites. The interacting atomic elements (conceived as unextended\npoints of force) give rise to primitive corpuscles and from the\ncohesion of corpuscles, a body is thereby constituted at the level of\nappearance. Wolff writes, \u201c \u2026 each body has its origin in\nthat which is not extended, although it is itself extended\u201d\n(Cosmologia, \u00a7223). At the level of appearance, bodies\ndisplay a number of determinate properties. Each body has a\nspecifiable size or magnitude (i.e., it can be measured), it occupies\na fixed space or place (insofar as it is extended), it displays a\ncertain shape, and it is divisible to the primitive corpuscles from\nwhich it is composed. Yet, according to Wolff, the properties of\nbodies should not be considered as the accidents of anything\nsubstantial because bodies are merely phenomenal manifestations of\nreal, interacting, atomic elements. Even the principal properties of\nbodies used in the analysis of bodily change and motion (i.e., the\nproperties used in mechanics), such as extension, the force of\ninertia, and motor force, are deemed by Wolff to be phenomenal\nproperties.\n\nNow according to Wolff all sensible properties of bodies should be\nconsidered as secondary (or mind-dependent) qualities. In \u00a7144 of\nhis Cosmologia, Wolff writes: \u201c\u2026extension is a\nphenomenon in the same sense in which color is accustomed to be called\na phenomenon\u2026\u201d. And somewhat later in this same work, he\nstates in \u00a7298: \u201c[t]he force of inertia is called a\nphenomenon in the same sense in which all sensible qualities are\ncalled phenomena\u201d. Perhaps the best way to understand\nWolff\u2019s view of sensible properties is to consider a quick\ncomparison with Locke\u2019s corpuscularian view of bodies. For\nLocke, the primary qualities of bodies, such as extension, solidity,\nshape, size and texture give rise to the secondary qualities that we\nperceive in bodies, such as color, sound, taste, smell and\ntemperature. According to Locke, secondary qualities are nothing in\nthe objects themselves but are the result of certain\n\u201cpowers\u201d inherent in the primary qualities of things which\neffect various sensations in us, such as the sensation of a certain\ncolor or temperature. Thus it is by virtue of a body\u2019s\nmicro-structure that we are able to perceive its secondary qualities.\nWolff, for the most part, accepts this causal-corpuscularian theory of\nsecondary qualities. However, unlike Locke, Wolff believes that all\nsensible properties are secondary qualities that result from a\nbody\u2019s atomic structure. In very simplistic terms, sensible\nproperties are for Wolff what color, sound, taste, smell and\ntemperature are for Locke. For both philosophers, secondary qualities\nare phenomenal and mind-dependent properties having their causal\norigin in some objective (i.e., mind-independent) reality. For Locke,\nthis reality is the independently existing corpuscles that comprise\nthe material world; and for Wolff, this reality is the unextended\npoints of force, or simple substances, that occupy his atomic level\ncf. Cosm. \u00a7191).\n\nBefore explaining Wolff\u2019s view of how extended composites come\ninto being (i.e., the causal process that allows us to form our ideas\nof extended objects), it is necessary to say a few prefatory words\nabout his view of space and time. The notions of \u201cplace\u201d\nand \u201cspace\u201d, on one hand, and the notion of\n\u201ctime\u201d, on the other, figure in at different stages of\nWolff\u2019s exposition of extended reality.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is an important distinction in Wolff\u2019s\ncosmology between \u201cgeneral space\u201d and \u201cparticular\nspace\u201d. Particular space (or a given place) is what an extended\nbody \u201cfills\u201d or \u201coccupies\u201d by virtue of its\ncorpuscular parts (Cosm. \u00a7\u00a7122\u20134). Its reality is\nderivative of the interacting atomic elements that give rise to\nindividual corpuscles. For Wolff, a corpuscle\u2019s place simply\nresults from a corpuscle\u2019s extension. A given place is conceived\nas an imaginary immobile container that has the same dimensions as the\nextended thing that occupies it (Ont. \u00a7\u00a7676\u20139).\nGeneral space, in contrast, is conceived as the perceived order of\ncoexisting bodies. As explained above, the existence of bodies is\nestablished by Wolff experientially and amounts to an instance of\nhistorical cognition. In \u00a745 and \u00a746 of his German\nMetaphysics, Wolff explains:\n\n\nIf we pay attention to ourselves [as thinking things], we will find\nthat we are conscious of many things outside ourselves. However, we\nset them apart from us in that we recognize that they are\ndistinguishable from us, just in the same way as they are set beside\neach other, we recognize they are distinguishable from each\nother\u2026. In that there are many things now which exist at the\nsame time and which are presented apart (and yet at the same time\ndifferent) from each other, such things come into being under a\ncertain order. And as soon as we perceive this order we perceive\nspace. Therefore, if we do not want to examine the matter differently\nthan we recognize it, we must assume space is the order of such things\nwhich are simultaneous.\n\n\nWolff\u2019s derivation of general space essentially involves three\nsteps. First, knowledge of the self, as a thinking thing, affords a\ndistinction between consciousness, on one hand, and consciousness of\nexternal things, on the other. Second, since that which is conscious\n(viz. the self) is different from that of which it is\nconscious (viz. the world), the self can recognize the\nhistorical and mathematical fact that it is conscious of many external\nthings at one time (i.e., the world as a plurality). And third, since\nthis empirical fact affords knowledge of real existences, the order or\nway the self represents these things is what becomes known as space.\nTo borrow Kant\u2019s terminology, Wolffian space lacks\n\u201cobjective reality\u201d because it is simply abstracted from\nthe coexistence of things in the world, and therefore takes on purely\na subjective character (cf. Beck 1969: 270).\n\nIn contrast to his theories of place and general space, Wolff holds a\nmuch more realistic theory of time. In a strict sense, place and space\nserve an explanatory role for Wolff at two distinct levels of\ndescription (viz. the micro-physical level and the level of\nappearance). Since atomic elements are unextended, the concepts of\nplace and space are considered by Wolff to be extraneous at the atomic\nlevel. Time, however, is not. Atomic elements are in time insofar as\neach element is in a constant state of change. In his most general\ndescription of time, Wolff writes: \u201c[t]ime is the order of\nsuccessive things in a continuous series\u201d (Ont. \u00a7572).\nSince each atomic element produces in-itself a constant and continuous\nseries of changes, time is regarded by Wolff as the objective measure\nof such changes. One clear statement of the Wolffian view of the\nrelationship between time and change can be found in a letter to Kant\n(dated 13 October 1770) from Johann Heinrich Lambert. Lambert\n(1728\u201377) writes:\n\n\nAll changes are bound to time and are inconceivable without time. If\nchanges are real, then time is real, whatever it may be. If time is\nunreal, then no change can be real. I think, though, that even an\nidealist must grant at least that changes really exist and occur in\nhis representations, for example, their beginning and ending. Thus\ntime cannot be regarded as something unreal. It is not a substance,\nand so on, but a finite determination of duration, and like duration,\nit is somehow real in whatever this reality may consists (AA\n10:107***AA?*).\n\n\nFor Wolff, Lambert, and Moses Mendelssohn, time is real insofar as it\nis an objective measure of change (cf. Falkenstein 1991 for\ndiscussion). Change is a constant feature of existing reality in that\nreal individuals are finite and created beings with a determinate\nduration. Real individuals come into and go out of existence. Time,\ntherefore, is applicable to the series of changes that occur within a\ngiven individual and, in the same respect, it is applicable to the\ntotality of all the individuals that compose the world-whole. Thus for\nWolff there is a meaningful sense in which real individuals and the\nworld-whole (itself) are \u201cin time\u201d. This is not to say,\nhowever, that time is granted its own ontological existence. In\nLambert\u2019s words, time is not a substance (i.e., something real\nin-and-of itself). More precisely, time is the measure of the\nobjective order of change that real things undergo.\n\nUnderstanding the sense in which atomic elements are \u201cin\ntime\u201d is important for grasping the manner in which\nWolff\u2019s atomic elements interact. Since atomic elements lack\nextension, the nature of atomic interaction is not spatial. It is not\nthe case, for example, that Wolff\u2019s simple substances influence\none another by physical contact and repulsion. Instead, atomic\nelements as unextended points of force affect, and are responsive to,\ndegrees of change by communicating with each other in time. The series\nof changes internal to a given atomic element are the result of its\nown power (or motor force) as well as the motor forces of other\nelements to which it is connected. Ultimately Wolff believes that it\nis the interacting forces of a multitude of simple substances that\ngives rise to our idea of an extended object. In particular, we\nperceive extended objects at the level of appearance insofar as there\nare unextended points of force interacting in time at the atomic\nlevel. Our confused perception of this temporal interaction results in\nthe idea of an extended object. Similarly to Locke, Wolff believes\nthat it is the primitive qualities of a composite that produce, or\neffect in us, the various ideas we have of its secondary qualities.\nSince all sensible properties are considered by Wolff to be secondary\nqualities, extension, or a composite\u2019s extendedness, results\nfrom the primitive forces of a composite at the atomic level. The\nanalogy that Wolff presents to help explain the phenomenal\nmanifestation of extension involves a rapidly ringing bell (Cosm.\n\u00a7789; cf. Burns 1966: 52). According to Wolff, just as the\nimpression we gain from a rapidly ringing bell is the sound of one\nprolonged peal, where the successive strikes of a bell\u2019s clacker\nare perceived as one monomial sound, our impression of extension is\nlikewise the result of many successively acting atomic forces that\ngive rise to our confused perception of one continuous extended\nobject.\n\nThe notion of \u201cextended-composite\u201d, as already mentioned,\nis what ultimately stands at the heart of Wolff\u2019s doctrine of\nthe world-whole. Insofar as the world is a composite being, it follows\nfrom the principles of Wolff\u2019s ontology that the world\u2019s\nessence consists in the manner in which its parts are linked together.\nThe world\u2019s parts, as described from the standpoint of\nappearance, are simply the multitude of interacting physical bodies\nthat are perceived in everyday life. And, if described from a\nmetaphysical standpoint, the world\u2019s parts are conceived by\nWolff to be the interacting unextended points of force that occupy his\natomic level. Yet regardless of what standpoint or level of\ndescription is employed, it is clear that a necessary condition of the\nworld\u2019s existence is that its parts need to be interconnected.\nAccording to Wolff, the world is conceived as a substantial whole\n(totum substantiale) by virtue of the fact that all of its\nparts form real reciprocal connections with one another. On the basis\nof this \u201cinterconnection-thesis\u201d the world is defined\nformally by Wolff as \u201ca whole which is not also a\npart\u201d.\n",
