    "main_text": "Inductive Logic and Inductive Probabilities || Two Conceptions of Inductive Probability\n2.3 Two Conceptions of Inductive Probability\n\nAxioms 1\u20137 for conditional probability functions merely place\nformal constraints on what may properly count as a degree of\nsupport function. Each function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) that satisfies\nthese axioms may be viewed as a possible way of applying the notion of\ninductive support to a language L that respects the\nmeanings of the logical terms, much as each possible truth-value\nassignment for a language represents a possible way of assigning\ntruth-values to its sentences in a way that respects the meanings of the logical terms. The issue of which\nof the possible truth-value assignments to a language\nrepresents the actual truth or falsehood of its sentences\ndepends on more than this. It depends on the meanings of the\nnon-logical terms and on the state of the actual world. Similarly, the\ndegree to which some sentences actually support others in a\nfully meaningful language must rely on something more than the mere\nsatisfaction of the axioms for support functions. It must, at least, rely\non what the sentences of the language mean, and perhaps on much more\nbesides. But, what more? Perhaps a better understanding of what inductive probability is may provide some help by filling out our conception of what\ninductive support is about. Let\u2019s pause to\ndiscuss two prominent views\u2014two interpretations of the notion of inductive probability.\n\nOne kind of non-syntactic logicist reading of inductive probability takes each support\nfunction \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) to be a measure on possible states of affairs. The idea is that,\ngiven a fully meaningful language (associated with support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\))\n\u2018\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B] = r\\)\u2019 says that among those\nstates of affairs in which B is true, A is true in\nproportion r of them. There will not generally be a single\nprivileged way to define such a measure on possible states of affairs.\nRather, each of a number of functions \\(P_{\\alpha}\\), \\(P_{\\beta}\\),\n\\(P_{\\gamma}\\),\u2026, etc., that satisfy the constraints imposed by\naxioms 1\u20137 may represent a viable measure of the inferential\nimport of the propositions expressed by sentences of the\nlanguage. This idea needs more fleshing out, of course. The next\nsection will provide some indication of how that might\ngo.\n\nSubjectivist Bayesians offer an alternative reading of the\nsupport functions. First, they usually take unconditional probability\nas basic, and take conditional probabilities as defined in terms of\nunconditional probabilities: the conditional probability\n\u2018\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B]\\)\u2019 is defined as a ratio of\nunconditional probabilities:  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid  B] =  \\frac{P_{\\alpha}[A\\cdot B]}{P_{\\alpha}[B]}.\\]\n\n\nSubjectivist Bayesians take each unconditional probability\nfunction \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) to represent the belief-strengths or\nconfidence-strengths of an ideally rational agent, \\(\\alpha\\). On this\nunderstanding \u2018\\(P_{\\alpha}[A] =r\\)\u2019 says, \u201cthe\nstrength of \\(\\alpha\\)\u2019s belief (or confidence) that A is\ntruth is r\u201d. Subjectivist Bayesians usually tie such\nbelief strengths to how much money (or how many units of\nutility) the agent would be willing to bet on A turning\nout to be true. Roughly, the idea is this. Suppose that an ideally\nrational agent \\(\\alpha\\) would be willing to accept a wager that\nwould yield (no less than) $u if A turns out to be true\nand would lose him $1 if A turns out to be false. Then, under\nreasonable assumptions about the agent\u2019s desire money, it can be\nshown that the agent\u2019s belief strength that A is true\nshould be  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[A] = \\frac{1}{(u+1)}. \\]\n\n\nAnd it can further be shown that any function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) that\nexpresses such betting-related belief-strengths on all statements in\nagent \\(\\alpha\\)\u2019s language must satisfy axioms for\nunconditional probabilities analogous to axioms\n 1\u20135.[4]\n Moreover, it can be shown that any function \\(P_{\\beta}\\) that\nsatisfies these axioms is a possible rational belief function for some\nideally rational agent \\(\\beta\\). These relationships between\nbelief-strengths and the desirability of outcomes (e.g., gaining money\nor goods on bets) are at the core of subjectivist Bayesian\ndecision theory. Subjectivist Bayesians usually take\ninductive probability to just be this notion of\nprobabilistic belief-strength.\n\nUndoubtedly real agents do believe some claims more strongly than\nothers. And, arguably, the belief strengths of real agents can be\nmeasured on a probabilistic scale between 0 and 1, at least\napproximately. And clearly the inductive support of a hypothesis by\nevidence should influence the strength of an agent\u2019s belief in\nthe truth of that hypothesis\u2014that\u2019s the point of engaging\nin inductive reasoning, isn\u2019t it? However, there is good reason\nfor caution about viewing inductive support functions as\nBayesian belief-strength functions, as we\u2019ll see a bit later.\nSo, perhaps an agent\u2019s support function is not simply\nidentical to his belief function, and perhaps the\nrelationship between inductive support and\nbelief-strength is somewhat more complicated.\n\nIn any case, some account of what support functions are supposed to\nrepresent is clearly needed. The belief function account and the\nlogicist account (in terms of measures on possible states of affairs)\nare two attempts to provide this account. But let us put this interpretative\nissue aside for now. One may be able to get a better handle on what\ninductive support functions really are after one sees how the\ninductive logic that draws on them is supposed to work.\n",
