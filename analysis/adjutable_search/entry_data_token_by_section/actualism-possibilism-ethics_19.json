    "main_text": "The Maximalism/Omnism Debate\n6. The Maximalism/Omnism Debate\n\nThe issues raised by the actualist/possibilist debate are relevant for\na number of other debates in philosophy as well. As has already been\ndiscussed, whether actualism, possibilism, or some intermediary view\nis correct has direct import for various principles in deontic logic,\nthe correct formulation of act-consequentialism, and for analogous\nquestions in the philosophy of action. The actualism/possibilism\ndebate, however, is perhaps most closely connected to the\nmaximalism/omnism debate. These debates are deeply interrelated. While\nboth concern questions about the scope of the agent\u2019s options,\nthe maximalism/omnism debate focuses on certain questions about how to\nassess these options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about whether\nall options should be assessed in terms of their own goodness, or\nwhether some options should be assessed in relation to the goodness of\nother options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about which facts\nground the reasons to perform the relevant options and, as will be\nillustrated shortly, are concerned with a wider range of cases than\nthose in the actualism/possibilism debate.\n\nThe maximalism/omnism debate concerns cases where the performance of\none option entails (or implies) the performance of another. Cases such\nas Professor Procrastinate are but one example.\nProcrastinate\u2019s \u27e8accepting the invitation and writing the\nreview\u27e9 entails \u27e8accepting the invitation\u27e9. Not\nall examples share Procrastinate\u2019s structure, however. Many\nexamples concern different ways of performing the same option in\ndifferent (e.g., more or less precise, better or worse) ways. For\ninstance, \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 entails \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, \u27e8visiting Uppsala\u27e9 entails\n\u27e8visiting Sweden\u27e9, and \u27e8kicking someone very\nhard\u27e9 entails \u27e8kicking someone\u27e9.\n\nNow, the central question in the debate concerns how the moral\nproperties of an option O are related to the moral properties\nof the options entailed by performing O. This abstract question\ncan be made clearer by considering an example. Suppose that I have\ngood reason to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 and good reason to\n\u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9. Those in the maximalism/omnism debate\nare interested in whether the reason I have for performing one these\noptions grounds the reason I have for performing the other. Is it the\ncase that I have reason to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 in virtue of\nmy having reason to \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 or vice versa? Or is\nthere no grounding relation between my reason(s) to perform these\noptions?\n\nOmnists hold that all options should be directly assessed in terms of\ntheir own goodness. Omnism may be defined more precisely as\nfollows.\n\n Omnism: All permissible options are permissible\nin virtue of having right-making property p. The property\np is right-making not only for all maximal options, but also\nfor all non-maximal options. (Portmore 2017a: 431)\n\n\nIn this debate, a maximal option is simply understood as one that is\nnot entailed by any other option, aside from itself (Brown 2018: 752).\nMore precisely, a maximal option may be understood as \u201can option\nthat is maximally normatively specific in the sense that it is\nentailed only by normatively equivalent options\u201d, where two\noptions are normatively equivalent if and only if they are equivalent\nin terms of all of the normatively relevant considerations (Portmore\n2017a: 428, 2017b: 2955). Any option that is not a maximal option will\nbe a non-maximal option.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose that hedonistic act-utilitarianism is true. To\nkeep things simple, suppose that the maximal options available to an\nagent S are \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9, \u27e8drink nothing\nwhile smiling\u27e9, \u27e8drink nothing while frowning\u27e9,\nand \u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9. Suppose furthermore that\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 would generate 5 hedons,\n\u27e8drinking nothing while smiling\u27e9 would generate 1 hedon,\n\u27e8drinking nothing while frowning\u27e9 would generate 0\nhedons, and \u27e8drinking a Pepsi\u27e9 would generate 10 dolors\n(or \u221210 hedons). The non-maximal options available to S\ninclude \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9 and \u27e8drinking\nnothing\u27e9. Finally, suppose that the following counterfactuals\nare true.\n\n If S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9.\n If S were to \u27e8drink nothing\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink nothing while smiling\u27e9.\n\n\nAccording to omnism, whether it is permissible for S to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 depends on whether \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 would result in maximizing hedonic utility. Given the\ntruth of (1), it wouldn\u2019t, so omnism entails that\n\u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9 is wrong. Likewise, according to\nomnism, whether it is permissible for S to \u27e8drink a\nCoke\u27e9 depends on whether S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a\nCoke\u27e9 would result in maximizing hedonic utility. It does, so\nomnism entails that \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 is permissible\n(and obligatory).\n\nUnlike omnists, maximalists hold that only maximal options should be\nassessed in terms of their own goodness. They believe that all\nnon-maximal options should only be assessed in terms of the goodness\nof the relevant maximal options of which they are a part. Maximalism\nmay be defined more precisely as follows.\n\n Maximalism: Not all permissible options are\npermissible in virtue of having right-making property p.\n(Max\\(_1\\)) p is right-making for all and only maximal options,\nbut (Max\\(_2\\)) the property of being entailed by a maximal option\nthat has p is right-making for all and only non-maximal options\n(Portmore 2017a: 429).\n\n\nAssuming hedonistic act-utilitarianism once again, according to\nmaximalism, the deontic status of the maximal options depends on the\noutcome of performing each option. According to maximalism, then,\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 would be obligatory and every other\nmaximal option would be impermissible. So, with respect to maximal\noptions, maximalism and omnism generate the same deontic verdicts. But\nnow consider what maximalists say about non-maximal options. This is\nthe point of contention between maximalists and omnists. By contrast\nwith the omnist\u2019s ascription of wrongness to \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, the maximalist holds that \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 is obligatory. This is because the obligatory maximal\noption is \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 and S cannot perform the\nmaximal option of \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 without performing\nthe non-maximal option of \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9. The\nnon-maximal act \u27e8drink nothing\u27e9, on the other hand, is\nentailed by an impermissible act, namely \u27e8drink nothing while\nsmiling\u27e9. So, maximalism entails that \u27e8drinking\nnothing\u27e9 is impermissible.\n\nInterestingly, omnism has typically been assumed in the literature. It\nmay have only operated as an unquestioned background assumption until\nthe groundbreaking work of Bergstr\u00f6m (1966) and Casta\u00f1eda\n(1968). Goldman (1978) and Bykvist (2002) defend distinct variants of\nmaximalism. Since then, there have been a few arguments against\nmaximalism (cf. Gustafsson 2014). Omnism seems to be considered the\ndefault position, though new arguments against omnism and in favor of\nmaximalism have started to appear in the literature recently (Portmore\n2017a,b, forthcoming; Brown 2018). Much of the debate revolves around\ntheProblem of Act Versions. Following Brown (2018: 754) and\nPortmore (forthcoming: ch. 4), this problem may be explained by\nconsidering the following three jointly inconsistent principles.\n\n(1)\nAn agent S\n    ought to perform an act \\(\\phi\\) if and only if \\(\\phi\\)-ing is her\n    best option.\n(2)\nRule (NI) If \\({\\vdash} A \\rightarrow B\\) then\n  \\({\\vdash} \\rO(A) \\rightarrow \\rO(B)\\)\n(3)\nOptimality is not closed under implication.\n\n\n\nEach of these principles seems quite plausible when considered in\nisolation. Principle (1) simply holds that an agent ought to perform\nthe best option available to her. Assuming hedonistic\nact-utilitarianism, the best option(s) will be whichever one(s)\nmaximize(s) hedonic utility. Principle (2) holds that if an agent is\nobligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\),\nthen she is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\). So, if an\nagent is obligated to \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 and\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 entails \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, then that agent is obligated to \u27e8drink a\nsoda\u27e9. \n\nPrinciple (3) holds that there are cases where an agent\nS\u2019s obligatory option (e.g., a maximal option) entails\nanother option (e.g., a non-maximal option) that, if performed, would\nnot result in S performing the obligatory maximal\noption. Performing the best option of \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9\nentails that S \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. But what would in\nfact happen if S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 is that\nS would \u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9 and \u27e8drinking a\nPepsi\u27e9 is not S\u2019s best option. That is, in fact,\nthe worst option.\n\nMaximalists have objected to omnism on the grounds that it, in\nconjunction with (2) and (3), entails a contradiction (Portmore\nforthcoming: ch. 4). Given omnism, S is obligated to\n\u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 because performing that act is\nS\u2019s best option. S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a\nCoke\u27e9 entails S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9.\nSo, given (2), S is also obligated to \u27e8drink a\nsoda\u27e9. However, recall that this case illustrates principle\n(3). If S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9. Given this, \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 would not result in S performing her best option.\nSo, omnism also entails that it is impermissible for S to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. Hence the contradiction. Omnism combined\nwith (2) and (3) entail both that S is obligated to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 and that it\u2019s impermissible for\nS to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. To avoid this contradiction,\nomnists must give up (2) or (3). Omnists such as Jackson and Pargetter\nhave given up (2).\n\nMaximalists reject omnism, which allows them to consistently accept\n(2) and (3), principles thought to have strong independent motivation.\nMaximalists, then, give up (1) to avoid the contradiction. According\nto the maximalist, sometimes agents are obligated to perform\nnon-maximal options (e.g., \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9) that are not\ntheir best option in virtue of the fact that they are obligated to\nperform their best maximal option (e.g., \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9)\nand performing their best maximal option entails performing a\nsuboptimal non-maximal option. In short, the maximalist responds to\nthe Problem of Act Versions by giving up (1), while omnists\nrespond by giving up (2). As may already be clear, some motivations\nfor, and against, omnism parallel those of actualism, while some\nmotivations for, and against, maximalism parallel those of securitism\nand possibilism. Whichever considerations settle one of these debates\nwill likely settle (or at least significantly bear on) the other.\n",
