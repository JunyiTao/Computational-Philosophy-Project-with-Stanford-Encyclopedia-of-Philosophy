    "main_text": "Theories of Well-being || Desire Theories\n4.2 Desire Theories\n\nThe experience machine is one motivation for the adoption of a desire\ntheory (for a good introduction to the view, see Heathwood 2016;\n2019). When you are on the machine, many of your central desires are\nlikely to remain unfilled. Take your desire to write a great novel.\nYou may believe that this is what you are doing, but in fact it is\njust a hallucination. And what you want, the argument goes, is to\nwrite a great novel, not the experience of writing a great novel.\n\nHistorically, however, the reason for the current dominance of desire\ntheories lies in the emergence of welfare economics. Pleasure and pain\nare inside people\u2019s heads, and also hard to\nmeasure\u2014especially when we have to start weighing different\npeople\u2019s experiences against one another. So economists began to\nsee people\u2019s well-being as consisting in the satisfaction of\npreferences or desires, the content of which could be revealed by the\nchoices of their possessors. This made possible the ranking of\npreferences, the development of \u2018utility functions\u2019 for\nindividuals, and methods for assessing the value of\npreference-satisfaction (using, for example, money as a standard).\n\nThe simplest version of a desire theory one might call the present\ndesire theory, according to which someone is made better off to\nthe extent that their current desires are fulfilled. This theory does\nsucceed in avoiding the experience machine objection. But it has\nserious problems of its own. Consider the case of the angry\nadolescent. This boy\u2019s mother tells him he cannot attend a\ncertain nightclub, so the boy holds a gun to his own head, wanting to\npull the trigger and retaliate against his mother. Recall that the\nscope of theories of well-being should be the whole of a life. It is\nimplausible that the boy will make his life go as well as possible by\npulling the trigger. We might perhaps interpret the simple desire\ntheory as a theory of well-being-at-at-a-particular-time. But even\nthen it seems unsatisfactory. From whatever perspective, the boy would\nbe better off if he put the gun down.\n\nWe should move, then, to a comprehensive desire theory,\naccording to which what matters to a person\u2019s well-being is the\noverall level of desire-satisfaction in their life as a whole. A\nsummative version of this theory suggests, straightforwardly\nenough, that the more desire-fulfilment in a life the better. But it\nruns into Derek Parfit\u2019s case of addiction (1984, p.\n497). Imagine that you can start taking a highly addictive drug, which\nwill cause a very strong desire in you for the drug every morning.\nTaking the drug will give you no pleasure; but not taking it will\ncause you quite severe suffering. There will be no problem with the\navailability of the drug, and it will cost you nothing. But what\nreason do you have to take it?\n\nA global version of the comprehensive theory ranks desires,\nso that desires about the shape and content of one\u2019s life as a\nwhole are given some priority. So, if I prefer not to become a drug\naddict, that will explain why it is better for me not to take\nParfit\u2019s drug. But now consider the case of the orphan\nmonk. This young man began training to be a monk at the earliest\nage, and has lived a very sheltered life. He is now offered three\nchoices: he can remain as a monk, or become either a cook or a\ngardener outside the monastery, at a grange. He has no conception of\nthe latter alternatives, so chooses to remain a monk. But surely it\nmight be possible that his life would be better for him were he to\nlive outside?\n\nSo we now have to move to an informed desire version of the\ncomprehensive theory (Sobel 1994). According to the informed desire\naccount, the best life is the one I would desire if I were fully\ninformed about all the (non-evaluative) facts. But now consider a case\nmade famous by John Rawls (1971: 432; see Stace 1944: 238):\nthe grass-counter. Imagine a brilliant Harvard mathematician,\nfully informed about the options available to her, who develops an\noverriding desire to count the blades of grass on the lawns of\nHarvard. Like the experience machine, this case is another example of\nphilosophical \u2018bedrock\u2019.  Some will believe that, if she\nreally is informed, and not suffering from some neurosis, then the\nlife of grass-counting will be the best for her.\n\nNote that on the informed desire view the subject must actually have\nthe desires in question for well-being to accrue to her. If it were\ntrue of me that, were I fully informed I would desire some object\nwhich at present I have no desire for, giving me that object now would\nnot benefit me. Any theory which claimed that it would amounts to an\nobjective list theory with a desire-based epistemology.\n\nAll these problem cases for desire theories appear to be symptoms of a\nmore general difficulty. Recall again the distinction between\nsubstantive and formal theories of well-being. The former state the\nconstituents of well-being (such as pleasure), while the latter state\nwhat makes these things good for people (pleasantness, for example).\nSubstantively, a desire theorist and a hedonist may agree on what\nmakes life good for people: pleasurable experiences. But formally they\nwill differ: the hedonist will refer to pleasantness as the\ngood-maker, while the desire theorist must refer to\ndesire-satisfaction. (It is worth pointing out here that if one\ncharacterizes pleasure as an experience the subject wants to continue,\nthe distinction between hedonism and desire theories becomes quite\nhard to pin down.)\n\nThe idea that desire-satisfaction is a \u2018good-making\nproperty\u2019 is somewhat odd. As Aristotle says\n(Metaphysics, 1072a, tr. Ross): \u2018desire is consequent\non opinion rather than opinion on desire\u2019. In other words, we\ndesire things, such as writing a great novel, because we think those\nthings are independently good; we do not think they are good because\nthey will satisfy our desire for them.\n",
