    "main_text": "Appraising Human Rationality || Normative Standards in Bounded Rationality\n8.3 The Perception-Cognition Gap\n\nDo human beings systematically violate the norms of probability and\nstatistics? Petersen and Beach (1967) thought not. On their view human\nbeings are intuitive statisticians\n (section 5.1),\n so probability theory and statistics are a good, first approximation\nof human judgment and decision making. Yet, just as their optimistic\nreview appeared to cement a consensus view about human rationality,\nAmos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began their work to undo it. People\nare particularly bad at probability and statistics, the heuristics and\nbiases program\n (section 7.1)\n found, so probability theory, statistics, and even logic do not offer\na good approximation of human decision making. One controversy over\nthese negative findings concerns the causes of those\neffects\u2014whether the observed responses point to minor flaws in\notherwise adaptive human behavior or something much less charitable\nabout our habits and constitution.\n\nIn contrast to this poor showing on cognitive tasks, people are\ngenerally thought to be optimal or near-optimal in performing\nlow-level motor control and perception tasks. Planning goal-directed\nmovement, like pressing an elevator button with your finger or placing\nyour foot on a slippery river stone, requires your motor control\nsystem to pick one among a dizzying number of possible movement\nstrategies to achieve your goal while minimizing biomechanical costs\n(Trommersh\u00e4user, Maloney, & Landy 2003). The loss function\nthat our motor control system appears to use increases approximately\nquadratically with error for small errors but significantly less for\nlarge errors, suggesting that our motor control system is also robust\nto outliers (K\u00f6rding & Wolpert 2004). What is more, advances\nin machine learning have been guided by treating human performance\nerrors for a range of perception tasks as proxies for Bayes error,\nyielding an observable, near-perfect normative standard. Unlike\ncognitive decisions, there is very little controversy concerning the\noverall optimality of our motor-perceptual decisions. This difference\nbetween high-level and low-level decisions is called the\nperception-cognition gap.\n\nSome view the perception-cognition gap as evidence for the claim that\npeople use fundamentally different strategies for each type of task\n (section 7.2).\n An approximation of an optimal method is not necessarily an optimal\napproximation of that method, and the study of cognitive judgments and\ndeliberative decision-making is led astray by assuming otherwise\n(Mongin 2000). Another view of the perception-cognition gap is that it\nis largely an artifact of methodological differences across studies\nrather than a robust feature of human behavior. We review evidence for\nthis second argument here.\n\nClassical studies of decision-making present choice problems to\nsubjects where probabilities are described. For example, you might be\nasked to choose the prospect of winning \u20ac300 with probability\n0.25 or the prospect of winning \u20ac400 with probability 0.2. Here,\nsubjects are given a numerical description of probabilities, are\ntypically asked to make one-shot decisions without feedback, and their\nresponses are found to deviate from the expected utility hypothesis.\nHowever, in motor control tasks, subjects have to use internal,\nimplicit estimates of probabilities, often learned with feedback, and\nthese internal estimates are near optimal. Are perceptual-motor\ncontrol decisions better because they provide feedback whereas\nclassical decision tasks do not, or are perceptual-motor control\ndecisions better because they are non-cognitive?\n\nJarvstad et al. (2013) explored the robustness of the\nperception-cognition gap by designing (a) a finger-pointing task that\ninvolved varying target sizes on a touch-screen computer display; (b)\nan arithmetic learning task involving summing four numbers and\naccepting or rejecting a proposed answer with a target tolerance,\nwhere the tolerance range varied from problem to problem, analogous to\nthe width of the target in the motor-control task; and (c) a standard\nclassical probability judgment task that involved computing the\nexpected value of two prospects. The probability information across\nthe tasks was in three formats: low-level, high-level, and classical,\nrespectively.\n\nOnce confounding factors across the three types of tasks are\ncontrolled for, Jarvstad et al.\u2019s results suggest that (i) the\nperception-cognition gap is largely explained by differences in how\nperformance is assessed; (ii) the decisions by experience vs\ndecisions by description gap (Hertwig, Barron et al. 2004) is\ndue to assuming that exogenous objective probabilities and subjective\nprobabilities match; (iii) people\u2019s ability to make high-level\ndecisions is better than the biases and heuristics literature suggests\n (section 7.1);\n and (iv) differences between subjects are more important for\npredicting performance than differences between the choice tasks\n(Jarvstad et al. 2013).\n\nThe upshot, then, is that once the methodological differences are\ncontrolled for, the perception-cognition gap appears to be an artifact\nof two different normative standards applied to tasks. If the\nstandards applied to assessing perceptual-motor tasks are applied to\nclassical cognitive decision-making tasks, then both appear to perform\nwell. If instead the standards used for assessing the classical\ncognitive tasks are applied to perceptual-motor tasks, then both will\nappear to perform poorly.\n",
