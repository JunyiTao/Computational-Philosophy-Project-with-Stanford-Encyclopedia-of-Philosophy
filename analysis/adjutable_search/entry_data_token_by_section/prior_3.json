Work on Modal Logic\n\n\nOf the four technical papers that marked the explosive beginning of\nPrior\u2019s career as a formal logician in 1952 (1952a-d), two concerned modal\nlogic. \u2018Modality De Dicto and Modality De Re\u2019 is a\ndiscussion of this distinction as it appears in Aristotle, Ockham, and\nPeter of Spain, together with a comparison of these earlier views with\nthose of von Wright in his 1951 book An Essay on Modal Logic. \u2018In What\nSense is Modal Logic Many-Valued?\u2019 concerns\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s four-valued matrices for modal logic. In this\npaper Prior took issue with the view \u2018that the logic of modality\ncannot be satisfactorily studied unless we use a many-valued calculus\nfor its formal expression\u2019, and he proposed a subversive\ninterpretation of the four-valued matrices according to which modal\npropositions remain bivalent. This paper was the curtain raiser to\nPrior\u2019s extensive study of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work on\nmodality, and thereafter he read \u0141ukasiewicz widely\u2014even\nmaterial in Polish, saying \u2018the symbols are so illuminating that\nthe fact that the text is incomprehensible doesn\u2019t much\nmatter\u2019.\n",
