    "preamble": "\n\nTo exploit someone is to take unfair advantage of them. It is to use\nanother person\u2019s vulnerability for one\u2019s own benefit. Of\ncourse, benefitting from another\u2019s vulnerability is not always\nmorally wrong\u2014we do not condemn a chess player for exploiting a\nweakness in his opponent\u2019s defence, for instance. But some forms\nof advantage-taking do seem to be clearly wrong, and it is this\nnormative sense of exploitation that is of primary interest\nto moral and political philosophers.\n\nExploitation can be transactional or structural. In\nthe former case, the unfairness is a property of a discrete\ntransaction between two or more individuals. A sweatshop that pays low\nwages, for example, or a pharmaceutical research firm that tests drugs\non poor subjects in the developing world, might be said to exploit\nothers in this sense. But exploitation can also be\nstructural\u2014a property of institutions or systems in\nwhich the \u201crules of the game\u201d unfairly benefit one group\nof people to the detriment of another. As we will see below, Karl Marx\nbelieved that the economic and political institutions of capitalism\nwere exploitative in this sense. And some contemporary feminists have\nargued that the institution of traditional marriage is exploitative\ninsofar as it preys upon and reinforces pernicious forms of inequality\nbetween men and women (Sample 2003: Ch. 4).\n\nExploitation can also be harmful or mutually\nbeneficial. Harmful exploitation involves an interaction that\nleaves the victim worse off than she was, and than she was entitled to\nbe. The sort of exploitation involved in coercive sex trafficking, for\ninstance, is harmful in this sense. But as we will see below, not all\nexploitation is harmful. Exploitation can also be mutually beneficial,\nwhere both parties walk away better off than they were ex\nante. Most philosophers think that what makes such mutually\nbeneficial interactions nevertheless exploitative is that they are, in\nsome way, unfair.\n\nIt is relatively easy to come up with intuitively compelling cases of\nunfair, exploitative behavior. Providing a philosophical analysis to\nsupport and develop those intuitions, however, has proven more\ndifficult. The most obvious difficulty is specifying the conditions\nunder which a transaction or institution may be said to be unfair.\nDoes the unfairness involved in exploitation relate to the\ndistribution of resources? Or a violation of her moral rights? Is the\nunfairness involved in exploitation a matter of procedure, substance,\nor both? And how, if at all, are the attitudes and motives of the\nwould-be exploiter relevant to assessing charges of exploitation?\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical Accounts of Exploitation\n\nAlthough the term \u201cexploitation\u201d appears not to have been\nused to describe unfair advantage-taking prior to the 19th\ncentury, there are nevertheless extensive discussions of the themes\nand problems that characterize contemporary discussions of\nexploitation in the history of philosophy. Those themes include the\nnotion of justice and injustice in economic exchange, the role of\nlabor in the creation of value, and the justification and abuse of\nprivate property, especially in capital and land.\n1.1 Pre-Marxian Accounts of Exploitation and Unjust Trade\n\nConcerns about exploitation often take the form of unfair economic\nexchange. Attempts to specify the principles that render an exchange\nfair or unfair can be traced back at least as far as Aristotle, who\nargued that a just exchange will embody a kind of reciprocity such\nthat the values of the goods exchanged are proportional\n(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Part V). But while the notion of\nproportionality is intuitively appealing, it is somewhat unclear\nprecisely what Aristotle had in mind by it, or what the most\ndefensible explication of the idea would be. To borrow\nAristotle\u2019s own example, if a shoemaker and a builder trade, how\nmany pairs of shoes is proportional to a single house?\n\nIn the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, we find the beginnings of a\nmuch more sophisticated and promising approach to questions such as\nthis. In his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas sought to answer the\nquestion of \u201cwhether a man may lawfully sell a thing for more\nthan it is worth?\u201d The \u201cworth\u201d of a thing, for\nAquinas, was its just price. And the just price, according to Aquinas,\nappears to have been simply the prevailing market price (Summa\nTheologiae, part 2, second part, question 77; see also de Roover\n1958 and Friedman 1980). Rather than relying on some fixed notion of\nproportionality, Aquinas\u2019 just price will be responsive to\nconsiderations of supply and demand. But not just any price\nthat two individuals mutually agree upon will be deemed just on\nAquinas\u2019 standard. Thus, a seller who takes advantage of fraud,\nor a temporary monopoly, to charge an excessive price for an item\nwould be acting unjustly, insofar as his price is in excess of the\nprice at which similar goods typically sell in the relevant market.\nBut Aquinas saw nothing inherently sinful in selling a good for more\nthan one paid for it, or with charging enough to earn a profit, or to\ncompensate for risks involved in the productive process. Seeking\nprofit for its own sake may involve a certain sort of\n\u201cdebasement\u201d, but profit can also be sought in order to\nfulfill necessary or even virtuous ends.\n\nLater Scholastics would devote considerable attention to developing\nand refining the notion of the just price. Of special concern was the\nprice attached to the lending of money, or interest. Since the\nfounding of the Catholic church, it was widely regarded as sinful for\nlenders to charge interest on their loans, and so-called\n\u201cusury\u201d was prohibited by canon and often by secular law.\nMuch of the concern regarding usury seems to have been driven by the\nidea that the charging of interest involves an inequitable\nexchange\u2014lenders give something to borrowers, but demand back\nmore than they have given. But Aquinas seems to have been particularly\nconcerned that borrowers would often be driven to take out loans out\nof necessity, and thus that their consent to the exchange is not fully\nvoluntary (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question\n78).\n\nThe much later natural law theorist John Locke also took up questions\nregarding just and unjust prices, not in either of his well-known\ntreatises on government but in a lesser known tract titled,\nVenditio. Locke, even more explicitly than Aquinas, saw the\njust price as being equivalent to \u201cthe market price at the place\nwhere he sells\u201d (Locke 1661: 340). The relativity of the just\nprice to the particular market in which the transaction takes place is\nimportant. For Locke argued that if two ships sailed laden with corn,\none to Dunkirk where there is a near famine taking place, and the\nother to Ostend where normal conditions obtain, it would not be unjust\nfor the merchant to sell at a significantly higher price in the former\nlocation than in the latter (so long as the higher price is one that\nthe buyers can afford). If the merchant did not charge a\nhigher price, Locke argued, then two problems would result. First, it\nis likely that the merchant\u2019s goods would simply be bought by\nspeculators and resold on a secondary market, thereby simply\nredirecting the profit into somebody else\u2019s hands without doing\nanything to improve the situation of buyers. And second, if merchants\ncannot charge a high price in \u201cgood\u201d markets to cover\ntheir losses in \u201cbad\u201d ones, they will soon operate at a\nnet loss and this will, Locke claims, \u201cquickly put an end to\nmerchandising\u201d (Locke 1661: 342).\n\nWhat would be unjust would be for the merchant to sell an\nitem to a particular individual for a price higher than the general\nmarket rate as might happen, for instance, if that individual is in\nparticular distress. Thus, Locke holds, if anchors typically sell for\na certain price, say 100 pounds, then it would be unjust\n(exploitative) to charge the captain of a distressed ship 5000 pounds\nfor an anchor, simply because one knows he will be compelled to pay\nit. The just price is the going market rate, where that rate is\ndetermined by the general features of supply and demand, and\nnot the particular needs or vulnerabilities of any particular buyer or\nseller.\n\nInterest in exploitation as a feature of economic exchange is thus\nalmost as old as philosophy itself. It was not until the\n19th century, however, that exploitation as a feature of\nemployment relationships came to be a subject of\nphilosophical and political concern. In a sense, of course, the\nemployment relationship is simply another instance of economic\nexchange, with the laborer selling his or her work in exchange for\nmoney in the form of wages. But two ideas led many people to think\nthat there was something special about labor. The first was a belief\nthat labor is the ultimate source of all economic value. The second\nwas the belief that labor morally entitles the laborer to the full\nvalue of that which he or she has produced.\n\nMore will be said about the first of these ideas in the discussion of\nMarx\u2019s theory of exploitation, below. The second idea, and its\nconnection to the idea of labor exploitation, is perhaps best\nillustrated by the theory put forth by the 19th century\nliberal Thomas Hodgskin. For Hodgskin, as for Locke from whose ideas\nhe drew heavily, the right of private property is a natural,\npre-political right. That right consists in\n\n\nthe right of individuals, to have and to own, for their own separate\nuse and enjoyment, the produce of their own industry, with\npower freely to dispose of the whole of that in the manner most\nagreeable to themselves. (Hodgskin 1832: 24)\n\n\nBut while the natural right of property is based on labor, there is\nalso an artificial right of property that is based on nothing\nmore than legislative force. That artificial right cements in place,\nthrough the machinery of government, property claims that had their\norigins not in labor but in violence, conquest, and theft. And it\nthereby enables capitalists to profit without labor, simply by virtue\nof their (illegitimate) control of the means of production (Reeve\n1987b).\n\nFor Hodgskin, capitalists exploit workers in precisely the same way\nthat landlords exploit their tenants. In both cases, one person is\nentitled to a stream of revenue simply by virtue of their legal claim\nof ownership (Hodgskin 1832: 97). The money the landlord earns as rent\ncomes from the wages the tenant earns as a laborer, just as the money\nthe capitalist earns as profit comes from the sale of products\nproduced by his laborers. In both cases, one person is able to live as\na parasite off the productive activities of others, all because the\nstate actively suppresses the natural right of laborers to the full\nproduct of their labor, in favor of the artificial right of property\nestablished by violence. One finds echos of Hodgskin\u2019s concern\nabout harmful parasitism in contemporary discussions of exploitation\nas well (van Donselaar 2009).\n\nEven before Marx, then, we see in the 19th century a tight\nconnection between theories of exploitation and theories of class and\nof class conflict. Marx himself credited the \u201cbourgeois\neconomists\u201d of the French Industrialist school with\nhaving pioneered the economic analysis of class struggle (Marx &\nEngels 1965: 69). For members of that school, the two great classes\ninto which society was divided were productive laborers and\nunproductive social parasites. The class of productive\nlaborers was understood broadly to encompass not only those who\nexerted physical labor to create tangible goods and services, but\nanyone who worked to make goods more useful than they would otherwise\nbe\u2014so laborers, yes, but also entrepreneurs,\narbitrageurs, and even capitalists in their role as managers\nand overseers of investments. The unproductive classes, in contrast,\nconsisted of those who consume value but do not produce it, such as\nthe army, the government, and the state-supported clergy (Raico 1977:\n395).\n\nAccording to Industrialists such as Charles Comte and Jean-Baptiste\nSay, the unproductive classes are able to maintain themselves by using\nthe coercive power of government to forcibly extract resources from\nthe productive. Taxes and tariffs were the most obvious forms such\n\u201cplunder\u201d could take, but the same goal could also be\nachieved by special protections for favored industries including the\nlimited conferral of monopoly power (Say 1964: 146\u2013147).\n\nFor both Hodgskin and for the Industrialists, then, the state was a\nkey agent in facilitating the exploitation of one class of individuals\nby another, and the most certain way to end exploitation was therefore\nto sharply limit the power of the state and to strengthen the\n\u201cnatural\u201d right of private property. But not all theorists\nof the 19th century saw things this way. For Ricardian\nSocialists such as John Bray, ending exploitation would require\nensuring that all persons have equal access to the means of\nproduction, and thereby guaranteeing a system of equal exchange based\non the labor theory of value (Bray 1839). While Hodgskin and the\nIndustrialists sought to purify capitalism from statist interference,\nBray and his fellow socialists sought to eliminate it altogether.\n1.2 Marx\u2019s Theory of Exploitation\n\nBy far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is\nthat of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are\nexploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to\ncapitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they\nproduce with their labor.\n\nFor Marx, however, exploitation was a phenomenon that characterized\nall class-based societies, not only capitalism. Indeed, it is\nfeudal society, not capitalism, where the exploitative nature of class\nrelations is clearest. Under feudalism, it is readily apparent that\nserfs use some of their labor power for their own benefit, while\nanother part (the corv\u00e9e) is used for the benefit of\nthe feudal lord. In contrast, under slavery workers appear to\nwork entirely for the benefit of their masters (though in reality a\npart of their labor goes toward providing for their own subsistence).\nAnd under capitalism workers appear to work entirely for the\nbenefit of themselves, selling their labor to capitalists as free\nindependent contractors (Cohen 1978: 332\u20133).\n\nIn reality, Marx thought, workers\u2019 labor under capitalism is\nneither truly voluntary nor entirely for the benefit of the workers\nthemselves. It is not truly voluntary because workers are\nforced by their lack of ownership of the means of production\nto sell their labor power to capitalists or else starve. And workers\nare not laboring entirely for their own benefit because capitalists\nuse their privileged position to exploit workers,\nappropriating for themselves some of the value created by\nworkers\u2019 labor.\n\nTo understand Marx\u2019s charge of exploitation, it is first\nnecessary to understand Marx\u2019s analysis of market prices, which\nhe largely inherited from earlier classical economists such as Adam\nSmith and David Ricardo. Under capitalism, Marx argued, workers\u2019\nlabor power is treated as a commodity. And because Marx subscribed to\na labor theory of value, this means that just like any other commodity\nsuch as butter or corn, the price (or wage) of labor power is\ndetermined by its cost of production\u2014specifically, by the\nquantity of socially necessary labor required to produce it. The cost\nof producing labor power is the value or labor-cost required for the\nconservation and reproduction of a worker\u2019s labor power. In\nother words, Marx thought that workers under capitalism will therefore\nbe paid just enough to cover the bare necessities of living. They will\nbe paid subsistence wages.\n\nBut while labor power is just like any other commodity in terms of how\nits price is determined, it is unique in one very importance respect.\nLabor, and labor alone, according to Marx, has the capacity to\nproduce value beyond that which is necessary for its own\nreproduction. In other words, the value that goes into the commodities\nthat sustain a worker for a twelve-hour work day is less than the\nvalue of the commodities that worker can produce during those\ntwelve hours. This difference between the value a worker produces in a\ngiven period of time and the value of the consumption goods necessary\nto sustain the worker for that period is what Marx called surplus\nvalue.\n\nAccording to Marx, then, it is as though the worker\u2019s day is\nsplit into two parts. During the first part, the laborer works for\nhimself, producing commodities the value of which is equal to the\nvalue of the wages he receives. During the second part, the laborer\nworks for the capitalist, producing surplus value for the capitalist\nfor which he receives no equivalent wages. During this second part of\nthe day, the laborer\u2019s work is, in effect, unpaid, in precisely\nthe same way (though not as visibly) as a feudal serf\u2019s\ncorv\u00e9e is unpaid (Marx 1867).\n\nCapitalist exploitation thus consists in the forced appropriation by\ncapitalists of the surplus value produced by workers. Workers under\ncapitalism are compelled by their lack of ownership of the means of\nproduction to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the\nfull value of the goods they produce. Capitalists, in turn, need not\nproduce anything themselves but are able to live instead off the\nproductive energies of workers. And the surplus value that capitalists\nare thereby able to appropriate from workers becomes the source of\ncapitalist profit, thereby \u201cstrengthening that very power whose\nslave it is\u201d (Marx 1847: 40).\n\nIn the first volume of Capital, Marx presents a series of\nformulas representing a tight relationship between labor,\nexploitation, and capitalist profit. According to Marx, the value of a\ncommodity is a function of three factors: constant capital (\\(C\\)),\ni.e., the labor value of nonlabor means of production such as\nmachines, buildings, and raw materials; variable capital (\\(V\\)),\ni.e., the labor value of the labor power of workers involved in\nproduction), and surplus value (\\(S\\)). Since surplus value comes from\nthe exploitation of labor (rather than machines or land), Marx defined\nthe rate of exploitation as the ratio of surplus value over\nvariable capital \\((S/V)\\). Of course, different industries will\nemploy different mixes of labor and other factors of\nproduction\u2014of variable and constant capital. Marx referred to\nthis mixture as the organic composition of capital, and\ndefined it as \\(C/V\\). But since capitalist profit is generated by the\nexploitation of labor, it seems to follow that industries that employ\na greater proportion of labor (of variable over constant capital)\nshould therefore earn a higher rate of profit. Thus, Marx defined the\nrate of profit as \\((S/(C+V))\\), which is equivalent to the\nrate of exploitation divided by the organic composition of\n\\(\\textrm{capital} + 1\\). This last proposition has been referred to\nby Jon Elster as the \u201cfundamental equation of Marxian\neconomics\u201d (Elster 1986a: 67).\n\nMarx\u2019s analysis of the rate of profit seems to entail that\nlabor-intensive industries will be more profitable than industries\nthat rely to a greater extent on constant capital. But this conclusion\nis clearly empirically false (B\u00f6hm-Bawerk 1898), and moreover\nincompatible with Marx\u2019s assumption of a competitive economy in\nwhich investments will adjust so as to equalize the rate of profit\nbetween industries (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Buchanan 1985: Ch. 3). Marx\nhimself recognized this fact, and sought to address it in the third\nvolume of Capital by dropping the assumption of volume 1 that\nvalue and price are equivalent, and showing instead\nhow value can be transformed into price through some more\ncomplicated process. Whether Marx\u2019s attempted solution to this\n\u201ctransformation problem\u201d was successful, however, is a\nmatter of great controversy (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Samuelson 1971;\nKliman 2007).\n\nMarx\u2019s theory of exploitation appears to presuppose that labor\nis the source of all value. But the labor theory of value to which\nMarx and early classical economists subscribed is subject to a number\nof apparently insurmountable difficulties, and has largely been\nabandoned by economists in the wake of the marginalist revolution of\nthe 1870s. The most obvious difficulty stems from the fact that labor\nis heterogeneous. Some labor is skilled, some labor is unskilled, and\nthere does not appear to be any satisfactory way of reducing the\nformer to the latter and thereby establishing a single standard of\nmeasure for the value of commodities. Moreover, the labor theory of\nvalue appears to be unable to account for the economic value of\ncommodities such as land and raw materials that are not and could not\nbe produced by any human labor. Finally, and perhaps most fatally,\nMarx\u2019s assumption that labor has the unique power to create\nsurplus value is entirely ungrounded. As Robert Paul Wolff has argued,\nMarx\u2019s focus on labor appears to be entirely arbitrary. A\nformally identical theory of value could be constructed with\nany commodity taking the place of labor, and thus a\n\u201ccorn theory of value\u201d would be just as legitimate, and\njust as unhelpful, as Marx\u2019s labor theory of value (Wolff 1981).\nTherefore, if, as some have alleged, Marx\u2019s theory of\nexploitation is dependent on the truth of the labor theory of value,\nthen a rejection of the labor theory of value should entail a\nrejection of Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation as well (Nozick 1974;\nArnold 1990).\n\nNot everyone agrees, however, that Marx\u2019s theory is\ndependent on the labor theory of value in this way. G.A. Cohen, for\ninstance, argues that Marx\u2019s theory of exploitation is not only\nindependent of the labor theory of value, but incompatible\nwith it (Cohen 1979: 345\u20136). Marx\u2019s account of\nexploitation is premised on the claim that value created by workers is\nappropriated by capitalists. But the labor theory of value holds that\nthe value of an object is a function of the labor that would be\ncurrently required to produce it, regardless of how much\nlabor actually went into producing it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the\nlabor theory of value is incompatible with the claim that labor alone\ncreates value.\n\nThe real problem with exploitation, on Cohen\u2019s view, is not that\ncapitalists appropriate value that is created by labor. It\nis, rather, that capitalists appropriate some of the value of the\nproducts that are created by labor. Labor may not produce\nvalue, but it is the only thing that produces what has value,\nand this is all Marx needs to get his account of exploitation off the\nground (Cohen 1979: 354).\n\nBut even if Cohen\u2019s account of exploitation avoids commitment to\nthe labor theory of value, it nevertheless remains committed to the\nMarxian idea that exploitation should be understood as the forced\nappropriation of surplus value. And there are at least two respects in\nwhich this commitment is problematic. First, it is unclear whether\nexploitation necessarily involves the forced transfer of\nsurplus value. Marx\u2019s account asserts that the laborer is forced\nto work for capitalists because the only alternative is starvation.\nBut suppose the government provides a safety net sufficient to ensure\nthat workers\u2019 subsistence needs are met. If someone chooses to\nwork in order to earn discretionary income, it still seems possible\nthat they could be exploited by a capitalist who appropriates some of\nthe value of the product the laborer creates (Kymlicka 2002: 179). A\nlaborer can be exploited, we might think, by being paid an\nunfair wage even if that laborer is not forced to\nwork.\n\nSecond, it is unclear whether all cases involving the forced transfer\nof surplus value are necessarily exploitative, at least in the\nordinary sense of involving a moral wrong. Suppose that governments\ntax workers and use some of the proceeds to provide support for\nchildren or the infirm. If it is exploitative for capitalists to\nappropriate some of the value of the objects produced by workers, is\nit not also exploitative for government to do so through the mechanism\nof taxation? Some libertarians have argued that this is precisely how\nwe should understand the coercive power of government. For Cohen,\nhowever, the fact that Marx\u2019s account of exploitation appears to\nbe committed to the libertarian idea of that workers own their labor\nand the products they produce with that labor\u2014that is, to the\nlibertarian idea of self-ownership\u2014is deeply problematic (Cohen\n1995: Ch. 6).\n1.3 Neoclassical Accounts\n\nThe idea that workers have rights to the contributions their labour\nmakes to the production of a social surplus is, we noted, common to\nboth Marxist and Libertarian theories. Yet, the widespread rejection\nof the labour theory of value apparently undermines (Cohen\u2019s\narguments notwithstanding) of Marx\u2019s classical account of\nexploitation. Neoclassical economists subsequently developed an\naccount of exploitation that incorporates this concern for an\ninput\u2019s contribution to the productive surplus that is\ncompatible with the subjective theory of value that replaced labour\ntheories in mainstream economic thinking. This account claims \u201ca\nfactor of production is exploited if it is employed at a price which\nis less than its marginal net productivity\u201d (Robinson 1933:\n281).\n\nThe neoclassical account was first fully developed by A. C. Pigou in\nThe Economics of Welfare (1920) and was refined by Joan\nRobinson in The Economics of Perfect Competition (1933),\nthough Reiff (2013) identifies both Alfred Marshall and John Bates\nClark as influences on Pigou\u2019s approach. Neoclassical accounts\nare, in many ways, precursors to contemporary market-based accounts of\nexploitation. Their move away from the labour theory of value allows\nthem to escape some of the technical problems that the classical\nMarxist definition encounters. However, they face their own technical\nand moral objections. Here we discuss three.\n\nFirst, according to the neoclassical account, exploitation is\nimpossible under perfect competition. Whether this aspect of the\nneoclassical account is a bug or feature depends on whether one thinks\nthat competitive markets and the pressures they can place on\nindividuals\u2014or the capitalist system, for Marxists\u2014can be\nexploitative. A point against the neoclassical account is that it\nseems that conclusions about whether or not competitive markets can be\nexploitative should be the result of substantive moral argument and\nnot merely settled by stipulative definition. On the other hand, the\nidea that market competition precludes at least certain causes of\nexploitation is compelling. Perfectly competitive markets exclude\nabuses of power by monopolists and monopsonists and the abuse of\ninformational asymmetries (Wertheimer 1996). A competitive market is a\ncontext in which the price that one pays for goods and services is\nshaped by the availability of these resources (supply) and the degree\nto which others need or want them (demand).\n\nSecond, the neoclassical account does not limit exploitation to\nlabour. The account also allows for the exploitation of other factors\nof production. Factors of production\u2014which classically comprise\nland, labour and capital\u2014are those resources used to produced\noutputs. The returns to any of these factors can be less than their\nmarginal product and when they are, on the neoclassical account, they\nare exploited. As with views about whether markets are exploitative,\nwhether capital can be exploited should be the conclusion of\nsubstantive moral argument and not settled by a definition. One might\nargue that the neoclassical account provides a technical and\nnonmoralised account of exploitation and further, that only the\nexploitation of labour is morally important. In this case, the\nneoclassical account would be an incomplete account of wrongful\nexploitation that requires supplemental arguments about the moral\nimportance of labour (like those advanced in Cohen 1979).\n\nFinally, and arguably most problematic, associating fair pay with\nworkers\u2019 marginal productivity means giving different workers\ndifferent pay for the same work. Decreasing marginal productivity\nmeans that the productivity associated with each additional laborer\ndecreases as more workers are added. Early hires will be associated\nwith greater marginal productivity than those who join later, even if\nthey all perform identical tasks. This also means that if an\n\u2018early\u2019 employee quits, the nonexploitative wage of an\nemployee hired later increases (because their marginal\ncontribution has increased). Thus, the neoclassical account cannot\nsatisfy the intuition that fair employment requires equal remuneration\nfor equal work. This problem can be avoided by modifying the\nneoclassical account so that exploitation consists in paying labour\nless than its average product. Yet the average product\napproach still cannot accurately track the contributions to output of\nindividual workers if some are more productive than\nothers.\n\nEach of the historical approaches surveyed here\u2014Pre-Marxian\naccounts, Marx\u2019s account, and neoclassical accounts\u2014have\ninfluenced and, to some degree, been incorporated into the\ncontemporary accounts that we cover in the following section.\n2. The Concept of Exploitation\n\nPhilosophical analyses of exploitation are broad and varied. As is\noften the case with such analyses, there is no widespread agreement\nabout what, precisely, exploitation is. However, consensus has emerged\naround some of the domain conditions for exploitation. Most\u2014\nthough not all\u2014philosophers agree that exploitation involves\ntaking unfair advantage, though, of course, they disagree about what\nexactly this involves. And most, but not all, philosophers also agree\nthat in order to be an exploiter, \\(A\\) must benefit and this benefit\nmust come at \\(B\\)\u2019s expense. We think few philosophers would\ndeny that exploitations can be all- things-considered harmful.\nHowever, much more philosophical attention has been given to mutually\nbeneficial exploitations, in which the exploited benefits from the\ninteraction, albeit in a morally problematic way. The reason for this\nfocus is that harmful exploitations are less ethically puzzling than\nmutually beneficial exploitations. The wrongs of harmful exploitation\nare more familiar, often over determined, and usually coextensive with\nfraud and coercion. Harmful exploitations are also likely to be\nnon-consensual and, of course, the harm itself may also be sufficient\nto explain the wrongfulness of these cases.\n\nThere is far less consensus about another domain condition: whether\nexploitation is a structural feature of social systems, a property of\ndiscrete individual transactions, or both. Philosophers also disagree\nabout more substantive features of exploitation, such as how we should\nunderstand the unfairness present in exploitations, about whether\nexploitation also requires something more than unfairness, such as\nmorally problematic motives or attitudes on the part of the exploiter,\nand about what Alan Wertheimer (1996: 279) has called the \u2018moral\nweight\u2019 (exploitation\u2019s permissibility or\nimpermissibility) and \u2018moral force\u2019 of exploitation\n(whether third parties should intervene in exploitations).\n\nIn the rest of this section, we discuss exploitation\u2019s various\ndomain conditions before surveying debates about unfairness, and other\npossible necessary conditions. Exploitation\u2019s moral status is\ncovered in section three.\n2.1 Domain Conditions\n\nThis section examines three possible components of exploitation:\ndifferences between transactional and structural accounts of\nexploitation, the benefit that exploitative transactions confer upon\nA, the harm they cause to B.\n2.1.1 Structural and Transactional Exploitation\n\nMany authors have pointed out that exploitation can be a structural\nphenomenon. What it means for exploitation to be\n\u2018structural\u2019 differs from account to account. For Matt\nZwolinski (2012: 155) exploitation is structural when it is brought\nabout by unjust \u201cconditions that lie in the background of the\nexchange\u201d. For Maeve McKeowan (2016) exploitation is structural\nwhen social systems structure and limit the options of disadvantaged\ngroups to the advantage of more powerful groups. Gabriel Wollner\n(2019: 157) argues that structures exploit by making an\nindividual\u2019s \u201cposition within the structure... such that\nin order to optimize or maximize economic revenue she has to take\nunfair advantage of others.\u201d Finally, Marxists often point out\nthat although Marx\u2019s technical definition of exploitation\n(outlined in section 1) can be stated in transactional terms, Marx\nalso conceived of exploitation \u201cas a property of the economy as\na whole, not just individuals\u201d (Elster 1986b: 176). Indeed, in\nRoemer\u2019s (1982a) unequal exchange account and later work by\nRoberto Veneziani (2007) and Naoki Yoshihara and Veneziani (2018)\nexploitation is not defined as a relational predicate at all. Instead,\nonly the predicates \u2018\u2026is exploited\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2026is exploiter\u2019 are defined. On these\nnon-relational accounts, whether agents are exploited depends on\nwhether the total labour they perform in the economy is greater than\nthe labour embodied in the total bundle of goods they consume.\n\nStructural exploitation in Zwolinski\u2019s, McKeowan\u2019s, and\nWollner\u2019s senses and transactional exploitation are not mutually\nexclusive. This is quite clear in Zwolinski\u2019s definition, which\ndirectly references an exchange. But both McKeowan and Wollner\u2019s\naccounts are also compatible with exploitation being a relational\nproperty of transactions. One distinction that is sometimes elided in\nthese discussions is between the sources of exploitable vulnerability\nand those who benefit from this vulnerability. That social systems,\nnorms and institutions make certain groups vulnerable while advancing\nthe interests of others does not entail that these systems themselves\nbenefit from the vulnerability (a feature of exploitations we discuss\nin the next section). By structuring interactions in such a way that\ngroup or individual \\(A\\) can take unfair advantage of \\(B\\), they\ncreate the conditions that allow \\(A\\) to exploit \\(B\\). However, to\nsay that the systems themselves gain from, and thereby\nexploit \\(B\\) involves a different (and less plausible) claim.\n\nIn contrast, non-relational forms of structural exploitation are\nconceptually distinct from transactional accounts. We surmise that\n\u2018exploitation\u2019 in ordinary use hews closer to the\ntransactional model because accusations of exploitation often target\ndiscrete interactions between groups, such as the exploitation of\nsweatshop workers by multinational corporations; the exploitation of\nthe elderly by con artists; or the exploitation of children by\nparents. However, note that the common use does not undermine the\nvalue of the non-relational conception as a tool for making moral and\npolitical critiques of social systems. Our point is merely that two\ndifferent conceptions exist and should not be confused. The\ntransactional model has, arguably received a greater amount of\nattention in contemporary moral and political philosophy and we will\nfocus primarily on it in the sections that follow.\n2.1.2 Exploitation and Benefit\n\nWhen \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\), \\(A\\) gains some benefit from\ninteracting with \\(B\\). We can see the relevance of the \u201cbenefit\nto \\(A\\)\u201d by contrasting exploitation with other forms of\nwrongdoing, such as discrimination, abuse, and oppression. Let us say\nthat \\(A\\) discriminates against \\(B\\) when \\(A\\) wrongly deprives\n\\(B\\) of some opportunity or benefit because of some characteristic of\n\\(B\\) that is not relevant to \\(A\\)\u2019s action. There was a period\nin American history in which many women became public school teachers\nbecause they were denied the opportunity to enter other professions\nsuch as law and medicine. To the extent that society benefitted (in\none way) from the pool of highly qualified public school teachers, the\ndiscrimination may have been exploitative, even if unintentionally so.\nBut if \\(A\\) refuses to hire \\(B\\) solely because of \\(B\\)\u2019s\nrace, then it would be odd to say that \\(A\\) exploits \\(B,\\) for \\(A\\)\ndoes not gain resources from the wrong to \\(B\\).\n\nConsider abuse. It has been alleged that medical students are\nfrequently abused by verbal insults and denigration and that this\nabuse may leave long-lasting emotional scars. It is also sometimes\nclaimed that medical interns are exploited, that they work long hours\nfor low pay. The contrast is just right. There is no reason to think\nthat anyone gains (in any normal sense) from abuse, but it is at least\nplausible to think that the hospitals or patients gain from the\nexploitation of interns.\n\nLet us say that \\(A\\) oppresses \\(B\\) when \\(A\\) deprives \\(B\\) of\nfreedoms or opportunities to which \\(B\\) is entitled. If \\(A\\) gains\nfrom the oppressive relationship, as when \\(A\\) enslaves \\(B\\), then\n\\(A\\) may both oppress and exploit \\(B\\). But if \\(A\\) does not gain\nfrom the oppression, the oppression is wrong but not exploitative. We\nmight say that the unemployed are oppressed, but unless we could\nspecify the ways in which some gain from their lack of employment, the\nunemployed are not exploited. Marxists would claim that capitalists\npay exploitative wages to the employed precisely because there is a\n\u201creserve army\u201d of the unemployed with whom the employed\nmust compete. But that merely confirms that they are exploited because\nthe oppression generates a gain to the capitalist class, and it is the\nemployed who are exploited and not the unemployed that make such\nexploitation possible.\n\nClearly, an exchange still counts as exploitative even if \\(A\\) does\nnot benefit on net. If \\(A\\) derives unfair benefit from his\ninteraction with \\(B\\), but suffers unforeseen costs such that she\nends up worse-off after the interaction than she was before, then\n\\(A\\) has still exploited \\(B\\). Less clear is the question of whether\n\\(A\\) must derive any actual benefit at all, or whether it is enough\nthat \\(A\\) merely intend to benefit. Suppose a sweatshop owner works\nhis employees ruthlessly in order to extract as much profit as he can\nfrom the workers\u2019 labor, but that the product the laborers\nproduce turns out, due to an unforeseen turn of events, to have zero\nmarket value. Have the sweatshop workers nevertheless been\nexploited?\n\nRelated to the question of whether \\(A\\)\u2019s intent to benefit is\nsufficient for exploitation is the question of whether \\(A\\)\u2019s\nintent to benefit unfairly is necessary for\nexploitation. Is it possible to exploit someone by mistake? Can one\nforesee that one\u2019s interaction will be exploitative without\nintending it to be so? If so, is \\(A\\) still culpable? (Ferguson\n2016b)\n2.1.3 Exploitation and Harm\n\nExploitation thus involves \\(A\\) unfairly benefitting from an\ninteraction with B. But what exactly does it mean to benefit\nunfairly? One natural response to this question is to\nconceive of unfairness as benefitting \\(A\\) at \\(B\\)\u2019s\nexpense. Perhaps exploitation advances the interests of \\(A\\)\nwhile harming \\(B\\). Exploitation, thus understood, is a kind of\nparasitism. Or, as Allen Buchanan defines it, exploitation is\n\u201cthe harmful, merely instrumental utilization of him or his\ncapacities, for one\u2019s own advantage or for the sake of\none\u2019s own ends\u201d (Buchanan 1985: 87).\n\nCertain paradigmatic cases of exploitation clearly fit this analysis.\nSlavery is an exploitative relationship, and one that clearly harms\nslaves for the benefit of their masters. But as Alan Wertheimer has\nnoted, some exploitation appears to be mutually advantageous rather\nthan harmful (Wertheimer 1996: 14). Someone who charges a hiker lost\nin the desert $1,000 for a bottle of water takes unfair advantage of\nher. Nevertheless, the transaction is one from which both parties\nemerge better off relative to how they would have been, had the\ntransaction not taken place. The seller has traded away something she\nvalues less (the bottle of water) for something she values more\n($1,000). But so has the buyer. If the water is necessary to save her\nlife, and if she values her life more than the $1,000 she gives up to\nsave it, then she too is better off with the transaction than without\nit.\n\nThere is, however, one important sense in which even an exploiter\ncould be said to harm her victim. Even if relative to a baseline of no\ntransaction at all, exploitation often makes its victim better off,\nrelative to a baseline of a fair transaction, exploitation\nleaves its victim worse off. In this sense, an exploiter\u2019s gain\ndoes, contra Joel Feinberg, come at the victim\u2019s expense\n(Feinberg 1988: 178). For even when both parties gain from the\ntransaction, the victim of exploitation gains less than she should\nbecause some of the \u201ccooperative surplus\u201d (to which she is\nby fairness entitled) has been captured by the exploiter.\n\nExploitation therefore does not necessarily harm its victim in the\nsense of making her worse off than she would have been, had the\nexploiter never interacted with her at all. Rather, it makes its\nvictim worse off than she should have been, had she been treated\nfairly. As with similar cases involving coercion, the precise details\nof our analysis thus depend on the relevant baseline against which we\nchoose to compare \\(B\\)\u2019s situation after the interaction. But\nthese details probably do not matter much as far as our\nall-things-considered moral evaluation is concerned. Whether we choose\nto say that exploitation involves \\(A\\) making \\(B\\) better off, but\nnot as much better off as \\(A\\) should have made \\(B\\); or\nwhether we say that it involves making \\(B\\) worse off than \\(B\\)\nshould have been, the final verdict is the same (Wertheimer 1996:\n22\u201323).\n2.2 Unfairness\n\nIn the sense in which most philosophers use the term, exploitation\nnecessarily (conceptually) involves unfairness. This sense of\nexploitation is thus a moralized term. To judge that someone\nis engaged in exploitation is already to pass a moral judgment on\nthem\u2014to say that they are acting wrongly (at least in a pro\ntanto sense). Not all uses of \u201cexploitation\u201d are\nmoralized in this way. As we noted at the beginning of this entry,\nsome ordinary language use of the term implies no moral judgment\nwhatsoever. And it is possible to develop a philosophically\nsophisticated account of exploitation that is relevant to\nmoral judgment, without being moralized (Goodin 1987), and indeed\nwithout referencing fairness (Vrousalis 2013).\n\nStill, even if exploitation is not conceptually unfair, it is\ncharacteristically so. In some cases, this unfairness is the result of\nsome procedural defect in the transaction\u2014call this\nprocedural unfairness. In other cases, the unfairness is a\nfeature of what is agreed to, rather than how the agreement\nis reached\u2014call this substantive unfairness.\n2.2.1 Substantive Unfairness\n\nSubstantive accounts of (un)fairness specify how certain goods (the\ndistribuenda) ought to be distributed by appealing to various\ndistributive criteria. Accounts differ according to how they specify\nboth the distribuendum and the distributive criterion.\n2.2.1.1 Equality\n\nOne of the most intuitively appealing criteria of fairness in exchange\nis equality. A fair exchange, it is tempting to say, is an\nequal exchange. But equal in terms of what?\n\nAlthough Marx took pains to deny he was giving an account of justice\n(let alone fairness), much of the intuitive force of his account of\nlabor exploitation seems to rely on the idea that a fair exchange will\nembody equal transfers of socially necessary labor. It is\nbecause the objects produced by the worker embody more socially\nnecessary labor than the wages he receives in exchange for producing\nthose objects that the laborer is exploited. And other\nlate-19th century theorists such as Josiah Warren and\nStephen Pearl Andrews made this moral claim explicit. \u201cIt is\nclear\u201d, wrote Andrews,\n\n\nif [an] exchange is not equal, if one party gives more of his own\nlabor\u2014either in the form of labor or product\u2014than he\ngets of the labor of the other\u2026that he is oppressed,\nand becomes, so far as this inequality goes, the slave or subject of\nthe other. (Andrews 1852: 52\u201353)\n\n\nBut even though a theory of labor-time as the basis of fair exchange\nis in principle distinguishable from a labor theory of economic value,\nthe former is subject to many of the same problems as the latter. How,\nfor instance, should the difference between skilled and unskilled\nlabor time be accounted for in determining a fair exchange? Between\neasy and difficult labor? Labor is not homogenous, and this makes it\nill-suited to serve as a currency of fair exchange.\n\nIf labor is problematic as a distribuendum, perhaps economic\nvalue would work better. A fair trade, on this view, involves the\nexchange of equally valuable goods or services. And an unfair trade\ninvolves the exchange of goods or services of unequal value. To return\nto an earlier example, someone who sells a bottle of water to a hiker\nstranded in the desert for $1,000 takes unfair advantage of her. And\npart of what makes the exchange unfair is that the bottle of water\nsimply isn\u2019t worth nearly $1,000. \\(B\\) is giving up far more\nthan she gains in exchange.\n\nOr is she? Once we give up on the 19th century notion that\neconomic value is an objective property of commodities, and embrace\ninstead that value is a function of the subjective preferences of\neconomic agents, the problem with this analysis becomes readily\napparent. Economic exchange is only possible precisely because\ndifferent agents assign different values to the same object. I sell\nyou my old television for $75 because I\u2019ve bought a new set, and\nto me, the old television is worth less than the $75. You pay the $75\nbecause you just moved into a new place and, to you, the $75 is worth\nless than the television. Neither of our valuations is the\n\u201cright\u201d one. Our preferences simply differ, and so it is\npossible for us to both walk away from the deal\nbelieving\u2014correctly!\u2014that we have gotten more than we have\ngiven up.\n\nCooperative exchanges create what economists call a \u201csocial\nsurplus\u201d. Suppose, to continue the television example, that\nI\u2019d be willing to take anything equal to or greater than $50 in\nexchange for my television, and that you\u2019d be willing to pay\nanything equal to or less than $100 for it. If, after bargaining, we\narrive at a sale price of $75, then I give up something I value at $50\nin exchange for $75, and come away $25 richer, and you give up $75 in\nexchange for something you value at $100 and walk away $25 richer.\nAll together, we\u2019re $50 richer. That\u2019s the social\nsurplus.\n\nThis suggests one final possible distribuendum that could be paired\nwith an egalitarian distributive criterion. Perhaps what makes an\nexchange is fair is not that the objects traded have equal economic\nvalue, but rather an exchange is fair when the social surplus created\nby the exchange is equally distributed. Exploitative exchanges, in\ncontrast, are those in which one party commands a disproportionately\nlarge share of the social surplus, leaving the other party with an\nunfairly small share. For example, suppose that an employer gains $10\nper hour worth of value from an employee\u2019s labor. An employer\nlike that could afford to pay its workers $9 per hour and still make a\nprofit. But if potential employees have nowhere else to go, why should\nthe employer pay that much? Why not pay employees as little as she can\nget away with\u2014maybe $3 an hour, just barely over the subsistence\nlevel of $2? In this case the employment relationship would generate a\nsocial surplus of $8. But $7 of that surplus would go into the pocket\nof the employer, while only $1 goes to the laborer. Might not that\nlopsided division of the social surplus be precisely what\u2019s\nunfair, and thus exploitative, about this kind of labor?\n\nPerhaps. But the unequal division of the social surplus cannot explain\nall cases of exploitation\u2014including some of the most\nparadigmatic. To see this, let us return once more to the case of the\nlost desert hiker. \\(A\\) offers to sell \\(B\\) a bottle of water for\n$1,000. This would appear to be a clear instance of an exploitative\nproposal. But it is not, as suggested above, because the water bottle\nis worth less than $1,000 to \\(B\\). Indeed, it is probably\nworth far more! Most people put a fairly high value on their continued\nexistence. So, suppose \\(B\\) values not dying at $1 million. In that\ncase, \\(B\\) gives up something he values at $1,000 in exchange for\nsomething he values at $1 million. \\(A\\), in turn, gives up something\nhe values at close to $0 in exchange for something he values at\n$1,000. The exchange creates a social surplus of $1 million, but fully\n99.9% of that surplus goes to \\(B\\), leaving \\(A\\) with a\nmere .1%. If exploitation consists of grabbing the lion\u2019s share\nof the social surplus of an exchange, then we are forced to conclude\nthat thirsty \\(B\\) is actually exploiting water-selling \\(A\\)\u2014an\nunlikely result!\n2.2.1.2 Sufficiency and Basic Needs\n\nIt is thus difficult to specify an egalitarian criterion of fairness\nthat explains the wrongfulness of exploitation across a range of\ncases. For this reason, few current theories of exploitation use an\negalitarian distributive criterion. One alternative is a\nsufficiency-based criterion, according to which exchanges are fair\nwhen the parties gain sufficiently from them. The crucial question\nhere is what qualifies as gaining \u2018enough\u2019?\n\nThe most common response, endorsed by both Ruth Sample (2003) and\nJeremy Snyder (2008), is that parties gain enough when what they gain\nis sufficient to ensure their basic needs are met. More\nspecifically, both authors argue that exploitation involves a failure\nto respect the value of those with who we transact. When we encounter\nothers whose basic needs are unmet, we should help them because of the\ninherent value they possess as a human being. In contrast, exploiters\nsee in the unmet basic needs of others not a cry for help but as an\nopportunity for profit. When they enrich themselves without ensuring\nthese basic needs are met, they transact unfairly with them.\n\nAlthough appeals to basic needs make sense intuitively, it is not\nclear that meeting basic needs is necessary or sufficient for an\nexchange to be fair. Two very poor persons who engage in an exchange\nare not necessarily exploiting each other even if they are incapable\nof meeting the other\u2019s basic needs. Transactions can be fair\ndespite basic needs being unmet. Conversely, two rich persons can\nstill engage in a transaction in which the social surplus is unfairly\ndistributed between them. \\(A\\) could buy \\(B\\)\u2019s yacht for an\nunfairly low price. Such cases are certainly of less moral concern\nthan unfair and exploitative exchanges between, say, a rich and a poor\nperson, but this does not entail that the terms of the exchange are\nfair. Transactions can be unfair despite basic needs being met.\n\nThe basic needs account is relatively straightforward to interpret in\nthe context of salary negotiations: it suggests that whatever the wage\nemployers offer their employees, it should at least be sufficient to\nensure the needs of these workers are met. But suppose \\(A\\) buys an\napple from \\(B\\)\u2019s stand: what, in this case, does the basic\nneeds account identify as a fair price? Must \\(A\\) pay a price that\nmeets \\(B\\)\u2019s basic needs for a year? Surely not. A day?\nPerhaps, but what if \\(B\\) sells many apples? Does this mean \\(A\\)\nshould pay less? The degree to which \\(B\\) is able to meet her needs\nvia her apple stand depends on the market she finds herself\nin\u2014the supply and demand for apples\u2014as well as features\nabout herself, such as how long or hard she works. One consequence of\nthis observation is that the basic needs approach may be impossible to\ninstrumentalize in discrete cases. A second consequence is that, since\n\\(A\\)\u2019s meeting \\(B\\)\u2019s basic needs depends, in part, on\n\\(B\\)\u2019s own choices, a moral hazard problem arises (Ferguson\n2016b). Indeed, this problem confronts all accounts of exploitation\nthat are not responsibility sensitive.\n\nSuppose that \\(A\\) knows that, should he become vulnerable for\nwhatever reason, \\(B\\) will be obligated to constrain \\(B\\)\u2019s\nadvantage over \\(A\\)\u2014perhaps by selling \\(B\\) goods for less\nthan the normal market price. Given this knowledge, \\(A\\) might be\ntempted to take a risky gamble, knowing that if it doesn\u2019t turn\nout well, \\(B\\) will be obligated to partly subsidize \\(A\\)\u2019s\nloss. In effect, \\(B\\)\u2019s obligation toward \\(A\\) puts \\(B\\) in a\nposition of vulnerability, a vulnerability that \\(A\\) has the\npotential to unfairly take advantage of. In other words, \\(A\\)\u2019s\nobligation not to exploit \\(B\\) renders \\(A\\) vulnerable to\nexploitation by B! To avoid this difficulty, it seems\nnecessary to limit the kinds of vulnerabilities that trigger the\nobligation to constrain one\u2019s advantage, perhaps by ruling out\nvulnerabilities for which agents are themselves morally\nresponsible.\n\nThe moral hazard objection, problems with instrumentalising the\napproach and especially the insufficiency and non-necessity of the\nbasic needs account suggest it is not very plausible as an account of\nfair exchange. However, this does not mean that basic needs and\nexploitation are unrelated. Exploitations that affect those who are\nvery poor are, quite plausibly, morally worse than those affecting the\nrich. We can appeal to welfare levels to justify placing a greater\nconcern on the exploitations of certain persons; those exploitations\nthat leave persons unable to meet their basic needs are arguably the\nmost pressing cases.\n\nThe basic needs approach is one of many possible accounts\nthat appeal to sufficientarian distributive criteria. For the basic\nneeds approach, the distribuendum is welfare and the distributive\ncriterion requires that welfare is sufficient to meet basic needs. One\ncould argue for an alternative version of a sufficiency-based\ndistributive criterion, for example, by claiming that fairness\nrequires greater levels of welfare than that which is sufficient to\nmeet basic needs. Alternatively, one could argue for a different\ndistribuendum, for example, by claiming that the social surplus, or\nembodied labour, or some other good must pass a certain threshold in\norder for the transaction to be fair. However, while these\nalternatives are conceptually possible, the basic needs approach\nremains the only widely defended sufficiency based account.\n2.2.1.3 Bargaining Solutions\n\nA third family of substantive accounts of fairness are those that\nappeal to various rational bargaining solutions, such as the Nash\n(1950) solution. For these accounts, the distribuendum is the social\nsurplus generated by exchange and the fairness criteria are those\ndistributions that rational agents would agree upon.\n\nBargaining problems are a form of two person cooperative game,\ncharacterised by (i) the status quo point, that is, what bargainers\nwould receive in the absence of an agreement; (ii) the feasible set of\nPareto improving points, which is shaped by the transactors utility\nfunctions, and (iii) a solution concept, which selects a (usually\nunique and Pareto optimal) point in this set as the rational\ndistribution. Nash\u2019s solution is the unique point in the\nfeasible set that maximises the product of the agents utility gain\ncompared to the status quo point for a particular distribution. For\nexample, suppose \\(A\\) wants to buy \\(B\\)\u2019s phone and the two\nare bargaining over the price. \\(B\\)\u2019s reservation price might\nbe $100\u2014she won\u2019t sell her phone for less. \\(A\\)\u2019s\nreservation price might be $200\u2014he won\u2019t pay any more than\nthis for the phone. In this case, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are bargaining over\na $100 surplus. For simplicity, let\u2019s also make the (usually\nunrealistic) assumption that the transactors utility gains are linear\nwith respect to money. In this case, \\(A\\) gains 100 utils if he gets\nthe phone for $100 dollars and \\(B\\) gets 100 utils if she sells the\nphone for $200. The Nash solution is the price at which the value of\nmultiplying \\(A\\)\u2019s utils by \\(B\\)\u2019s utils is maximised.\nAs we can see in the following simplified table, in this case the Nash\nsolution happens to also involve an equal split of the utility: when\nboth gain 50 utils (which by our simplifying assumption is also $50)\nthe product of the agents utilities is maximised.\n\n\n\nUtility Gain\n\\(B\\)\u2019s Utility Gain\nProduct \\((A\\times B)\\)  \n\n\n0\n100\n0 \n\n10\n90\n900 \n\n20\n80\n1600 \n\n30\n70\n2100 \n\n40\n60\n2400 \n\n50\n50\n2500 \n\n60\n40\n2400 \n\n70\n30\n2100 \n\n80\n20\n1600 \n\n90\n10\n900 \n\n100\n0\n0  \n\n\nNote that the Nash solution does not always select an equal\ndistribution. If \\(A\\)\u2019s utility increased linearly with his\nmonetary gain, while \\(B\\) placed greater weight on the first $10 than\nshe did on the next $10, a different distribution would result.\n\nNash argued that his solution was the rational solution to\nbargaining problems because it is the only solution that satisfies\nfour axioms that, he argued, any agents not involved in a bargain\nwould select as desiderata for a bargaining problem: Pareto\noptimality, utility invariance, symmetry, and independence. An\nalternative justification is provided by Brian Barry who argued that\nif the bargaininers were to hire an independent arbitrator to\ndetermine how gains should be distributed, \u201ceach side will\nrefuse to accept any arbitrator whose decision it expects to be less\nfavourable than the outcome of direct bargaining ...[A]n arbitrator\nwho is acceptable to both sides must be one whose decisions\napproximate the Nash solution\u201d (Barry 1991: 26\u201427).\n\nBargaining solutions, such as Nash\u2019s, might identify outcomes\nthat agents would be rational to agree upon, but are these\ndistributions also fair? One concern is that they take the\npre-bargaining status quo as given. Yet, the context that leads up to\na transaction might play some role in what kinds of outcomes are fair.\nFor example, suppose in our phone sale case that \\(B\\) is selling her\nphone because her hotel room was burgled while on holiday. \\(B\\) needs\nmoney now and the only item of value remaining in her\npossession is her phone. So, while \\(B\\) might, if given more time, be\nable to sell her phone for much as much as $1000, \\(A\\) is the only\nbuyer she can find on short notice. \\(B\\)\u2019s desperation lowers\nher reservation price and, consequently, alters the Nash solution as\nwell. It isn\u2019t necessarily the case that the outcomes of\nbargains resulting from circumstantial pressures are unfair, but when\nthese pressures result from identifiable injustices, as in\n\\(B\\)\u2019s case, the bargaining outcome appears unfair. This\ncontextual insensitivity to the sources of bargaining power undermines\nthe sufficiency of bargaining solutions as criteria for fair\ntransaction.\n\nThere are also reasons to think that bargaining solutions are\nunnecessary as criteria for fair transaction. Suppose that the\ntransactors\u2019 status quo points are morally acceptable\n(so that there is nothing morally suspect about the Nash solution\nitself), but the transactors (irrationally) agree to an outcome that\nis not Pareto optimal. For example, it might be that 100\nutils are up for grabs and the Nash solution dictates both receive 50%\nof the gains but both transactors irrationally \u2018burn\u2019 the\nsame portion of their gains, each taking only 40 utils. This behaviour\nwould be odd and, by definition, against each agent\u2019s interests,\nbut it does not seem that the distribution would be unfair. The point\nis that rationality may require optimisation, but fairness\ndoes not. Non-optimal distributions that preserve the proportionality\nof the Nash solution remain fair. If this is the case, arriving at the\nNash solution is not strictly necessary for a fair transaction.\n2.2.2 Procedural Unfairness\n\nProblems with substantive accounts of fairness in transactions have\nled many philosophers to adopt procedural accounts, which, recall,\nidentify unfairness with some procedural flaw in the transaction\nrather than with a particular transactional outcome. Here we survey\nthree: Wertheimer\u2019s (1996) fair market value account,\nRoemer\u2019s (1982a,b) property relations account and\nSteiner\u2019s (1984, 1987) historical rights-based account.\n2.2.2.1 Fair Market Value\n\nThere are good reasons to think that markets can tell us something\nabout fair prices. A fair price, it seems should reflect how rare\nsomething is and how much others would like to have it. There are some\ngoods, such as air or water, that are\u2014at least in high-income\ncountries\u2014in abundant supply. Even though our demand for these\ngoods is high, the supply of these goods is also considerable, meaning\nthat they command relatively low prices on the market. In contrast,\ngoods like a particular child\u2019s primary school artwork may have\nlow supply (perhaps only a few of little Jane\u2019s or Tom\u2019s\nTurkey-hand-collages exist in the world), but since demand for these\ngoods is limited to the child\u2019s parents, the price these goods\nwould fetch on the market is low. Those goods that are both rare (low\nin supply) and popular (high in demand), like prime real estate, are\nexpensive. Acquiring them requires giving up a greater amount of those\nresources we already have. And since there are many others who would\nlike to have these rare goods, it is, intuitively, fair that one\nshould have to give up more to obtain them.\n\nHowever, fair prices cannot be associated with actual market\nprices because we often want to claim that actual market prices are\nunfair. Thus, while markets\u2019 ability to make prices reflect\ngoods\u2019 scarcity and others demand for them may take us some way\ntowards a procedure for generating a fair price, it seems that the\nconditions in which markets operate must also be fair themselves. Alan\nWertheimer (1996) has argued that the fair price is the price that\ngoods would fetch in a hypothetical competitive market that excludes\nasymmetries of information and undue pressure. Wertheimer argues that\n\u201cfair market value\u201d prices are prices at which neither\nparty takes special unfair advantage of the other\nparty\u2019s decision-making capacity or special vulnerabilities in\nthe other party\u2019s situation (232). Such a price, he notes,\n\u201cmay or may not be a \u2018just price\u2019, all things\nconsidered, but it may well be a non-exploitative price\u201d (232).\nAlthough the fair market value approach enjoys some intuitive appeal,\nit is unclear that Wertheimer\u2019s conditions of pressure and full\ninformation are required for fair prices.\n\nConsider full information. Information is a good that can be traded on\nthe market itself. Obtaining information can be costly and time\nconsuming. Indeed, information is the main commodity that universities\ntrade in: students pay tuition in order to obtain information about\ntheir topics of study. The fair price for a university education may\nindeed differ from that which we find in current markets, but this\ndoes not mean that professors\u2019 cannot profit from their own\ninformational endowments. Of course, some informational asymmetries\nare indeed unfair. Asymmetries introduced by deception, for example,\nare characteristic of fraudulent transactions. There may also be moral\nlimits on the returns one can enjoy from informational asymmetries.\nBut the point is that mere asymmetries of information are not always\nunfair.\n\nNow consider pressure. Suppose \\(B\\) forgot her lunch at home. Her\nwillingness to buy a sandwich from \\(A\\) is now greater than it would\nhave been had she not forgotten her lunch; she\u2019ll pay more for a\nsandwich given than she\u2019s forgotten her lunch than she would had\nshe remembered it. In this case, \\(B\\)\u2019s hunger exerts a\npressure on her that causes her to pay \\(A\\) a higher price for a\nsandwich. But there\u2019s nothing unfair about having to\npay for (or pay more for) lunch because you forgot your lunch.\nPressure does not necessarily make a transaction unfair. Yet, like\nasymmetries of information, pressure can lead to transactions\nthat are, intuitively, unfair. If \\(B\\) is drowning and \\(A\\) offers\nto save her only if she pays him $100,000, many would say\n\\(A\\)\u2019s offer takes unfair advantage of the undue pressure that\nthe threat of drowning places on \\(B\\).\n\nIn situations involving informational asymmetries and pressure both\nthe degree and source of these factors influences\nour willingness to say that effects they have on the terms of a\ntransaction are unfair. We are less willing to say that \\(B\\) paying\n\\(A\\) more for a sandwich is unfair if the source of the pressure is\nsuch that it arises from \\(B\\)\u2019s own choices. It is more\nplausible to say that \\(B\\)\u2019s paying \\(A\\) more is unfair if the\nreason she is hungry is that \\(C\\) has stolen her sandwich. Similarly,\nthe degree of pressure or asymmetric information also\ninfluences whether we are willing to say these factors give rise to\nunfair terms. The higher price \\(B\\) might pay given that she forgot\nher lunch might be fair while the price she might be willing to pay if\nshe were starving might not be fair.\n\nOne way to capture these rough intuitions about the degree and source\nof factors that influence prices is to appeal to antecedent notions of\njustice. In other words, whether influence of pressure, information\nand other factors on price is fair depends on whether the\ndistributions of information and pressure among the parties are just.\nIn this case, the fair price would not be that which excludes all\ninfluence from pressure or informational asymmetries, but instead the\nprice that we would find in a just market. Of course, there\nare many competing conceptions of justice. However, the next\nprocedural account offers structural conditions that are, in\nprinciple, compatible with a wide range of approaches to justice.\n2.2.2.2 Unjust Property Relations and Historical Injustice\n\nMany have found plausible Marx\u2019s claim that employment\nrelationships under capitalism are exploitative. But perhaps Marx was\nwrong to locate that exploitation in the particular details of the\ncapitalist-employee relationship. After all, what makes exploitation\npossible at all on Marx\u2019s view is a feature of the macro level\ndistribution of property in society\u2014specifically\ncapitalists\u2019 monopoly over the means of production. Marx\u2019s\nformal theory of exploitation, however, makes no explicit mention of\nthis property relation, focusing instead entirely on the interaction\nbetween capitalists and laborers at the point of production. The\nresult, according to John Roemer, is a theory that is focused too much\non the micro level of particular employment relationships and not\nenough on the macro level background of inegalitarian property\ndistribution against which those relationships take place (Roemer\n1982a,b).\n\nOn Roemer\u2019s analysis, capitalist exploitation is essentially a\nform of social parasitism. One group (the capitalists) are made better\noff by the existence of a second group (workers), but that second\ngroup is made worse off by the existence of the first. More\nformally, according to Roemer\u2019s account (1982b, 194\u201495),\nwe may say that a group \\(S\\) in a larger society \\(N\\) is exploited\nby its complement group \\(S'\\) (relative to \\(N\\)) if and only \n if:[1]\n\nThere is an alternative, which we may conceive of as\nhypothetically feasible, in which \\(S\\) would be better off than in\nits present situation [by withdrawing from society].\nUnder this alternative, the complement group \\(S'\\) relative to\n\\(N\\) (i.e., \\(S' = N - S\\)), would be worse off than at present.\n\\(S'\\) is in a relationship of dominance to \\(S\\).\n\n\nLater, in order to ensure that \\(S'\\) gained at the expense of \\(S\\),\nRoemer added the condition,\n\nIf \\(S'\\) were to withdraw from society with its own\nendowments, then \\(S'\\) would be worse off than at present.\n\n\nRoemer\u2019s account clearly separates the structure of exploitation\nfrom the particular content that gives rise to exploitation claims.\nDifferent specifications of the withdrawal conditions in (1) yield\ndifferent accounts of exploitation. For example, a relation that\nRoemer terms \u2018feudal exploitation\u2019 occurs when \\(S\\) would\nbe better off withdrawing with their own endowments. Historically,\nfeudal serfs were required to perform corv\u00e9e labour on\nlords\u2019 lands and/or required to pay rents in exchange for\n\u2018protection\u2019. Under the assumption that such\n\u2018protection\u2019 was not of real value, this arrangement was\nexploitative. Serfs would be better off withdrawing with their own\nlabour and land and not paying the lords. Having lost the value of\nthis labour or rent, lords would be worse off. Roemer identifies\ncapitalist exploitation as a situation in which \\(S\\) is allowed to\nwithdraw with their per capita alienable assets and socialist\nexploitation as a situation in which they withdraw with their per\ncapita alienable and inalienable assets (such as skills and talents).\nMany other forms of exploitation are possible under the Roemerian\nstructure. For example, \\(S\\) might be \u2018Rawls Exploited\u2019\nif they would be better off withdrawing with the basic liberties and\nprimary goods required by Rawls\u2019s two principles of justice.\n\nThe separation of the structure of exploitation from its ethical\ncontent helps to clarify disagreement about whether a particular\nsituation is exploitative. Two parties might disagree about whether\ncapitalism is exploitative, for example, because they disagree about\nwhether productive assets ought to be distributed in an egalitarian\nmanner, while agreeing that exploitation does require something like\nthe conditions Roemer outlines. On the other hand, parties might\nagree about the theory just distributions that informs\nRoemer\u2019s forms of exploitation while disagreeing about whether\nRoemer\u2019s conditions are necessary and sufficient for\nexploitation.\n\nNote that Roemer\u2019s definition is a partition of \\(N\\) into two\nmutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subset groups. As such, it\nprecludes the possibility of a third group with neutral exploitation\nstatus.  This feature might not be particularly odd if we think that\nsociety divides rather crudely into two groups: exploiting capitalists\nand exploited workers. However, Roemer himself allows for and\ntheorises the existence of more than two classes. One explanation for\nthis feature of the definition is that it simply arises from\nRoemer\u2019s coalitional approach.\n\nHere we outline two critiques that have been raised against\nRoemer\u2019s structural conditions: first, that an antecedent unjust\ndistribution is not necessary for exploitation; second, that\nRoemer\u2019s appeal to domination in condition (3) is ad hoc and\nunsatisfactory. (Note that Roemer does not explicitly state that the\ndifference between the actual and hypothetical alternative is an\ninjustice. Rather, this is an implicit assumption based on one\u2019s\nselection of the hypothetical baseline. Nevertheless, many of\nRoemer\u2019s critics have attributed to Roemer the assumption that\nthe actual distribution is unjust. See, for example, Vrousalis 2013:\n131.)\n\nMany theorists agree that an antecedent injustice is necessary for\nexploitation. For example, Hillel Steiner\u2019s account of\nexploitation holds that exploitation occurs when \\(A\\) gains more from\nan interaction, and \\(B\\) gains less, than they would have were it not\nfor the existence of a prior injustice (Steiner 1984). So, for\nexample, if \\(A\\) hires \\(B\\) as a laborer and is able to pay \\(B\\) a\nlow wage of $2 per hour only because \\(A\\) (or someone else) has\npreviously unjustly deprived \\(B\\) of alternative sources of labor,\nthen \\(A\\) has exploited \\(B\\). If, on the other hand, the explanation\nfor \\(B\\)\u2019s earning only $2 does not involve injustice\u2014if\n\\(B\\) simply does not have very valuable skills, or if there is a\nlarge supply of (not unjustly) unemployed laborers, then a $2 wage, no\nmatter how insufficient it might be to meet \\(B\\)\u2019s needs, and\nno matter how much more \\(A\\) could afford to pay, is not\nexploitative. Like Roemer\u2019s account, Steiner\u2019s has the\nadvantage of being a structural account. Indeed, the two bear much in\ncommon. Roemer\u2019s account is focused on \u201cmacro\u201d\nissues pertaining to the distribution of property in society, while\nSteiner\u2019s focuses on \u201cmicro\u201d issues regarding how\nindividuals treat each other within the framework created by that\ndistribution (Ferguson and Steiner 2016: 545\u2013546).\n\nLike Steiner and Roemer, Ruth Sample agrees that exploitation can take\nthe form of taking advantage of past injustice (Sample 2003: 74). If\n\\(A\\) uses the fact that \\(B\\) is disadvantaged as a result of past\ninjustice for his own profit then, Sample argues, \\(A\\) has failed to\ntreat \\(B\\) with respect and has exploited him for his own gain.\n\nOn the other hand, some theorists have argued that the source of\nvulnerability is irrelevant to the exploitative nature of a\ntransaction. Robert Goodin, for instance, argues that exploitation\nconsists in \u201cplaying for advantage in situations where it is\ninappropriate to do so\u201d, and involves a violation of the moral\nnorm of \u201cprotecting the vulnerable\u201d. Importantly, Goodin\nholds that this norm applies \u201cregardless of the particular\nsource of their vulnerability\u201d (Goodin 1987: 187). Thus, whether\na worker is economically vulnerable because of a past injustice or\nwhether her vulnerability derives from a normal fluctuation of the\nbusiness cycle is irrelevant. To use that vulnerability to press\none\u2019s own advantage is exploitative. Wertheimer claims that\n\u201ceven in a reasonably just society, people will find themselves\nin situations in which they can strike an agreement that will produce\nmutual gain, and some of these cases will give rise to allegations of\nexploitation\u201d (Wertheimer 1996, 9). Similarly, Nicholas\nVrousalis rejects the claim that \u201c\\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\nif and only if the exchange in which they are engaged occurs against\nthe background of an unjust distribution\u201d, and he concludes that\n\u201casset injustice furnishes no necessary condition for\nexploitation\u201d (Vrousalis 2013: 148\u2014149). Matt Zwolinski\nechoes these concerns, arguing that the kinds of background injustice\nto which Roemer\u2019s conditions appeal is not necessary. Zwolinski\nclaims that, \u201cOffering to rescue an individual who became\nstranded in the desert because of her own poor planning in exchange\nfor her entire net worth is wrongfully exploitative because of the\nunfairness of the terms of the transaction, not because of the history\nor institutional background to that transaction\u201d (Zwolinski\n2012, 171) (Vrousalis uses as similar case to motivate his objection).\nZwolinski also argues that historical injustice is also not a\nsufficient condition, for we can imagine cases where parties gain from\npast injustice without thereby engaging in exploitation. If\n\\(B\\)\u2019s home is unjustly burned to the ground by an arsonist,\nand a contractor \\(A\\) charges \\(B\\) a normal market price to rebuild\nit, then \\(A\\) has not exploited \\(B\\), despite the fact that \\(A\\)\nhas profited from the injustice suffered by \\(B\\) (Zwolinski 2012:\n172).\n\nThere are two ways Roemer\u2014and those theorists who appeal to\nantecedent injustice in \u2018historical\u2019 accounts of\nexploitation\u2014might resist the objections advanced by Vrousalis,\nZwolinski and others. First, one could expand the scope of injustice\n(Ferguson 2020); alternatively, one could bite the bullet and attempt\nto explain why such cases are not, in fact, instances of exploitation\n(Ferguson 2016a). Let\u2019s examine each in turn.\n\nIt is natural to restrict \u2018injustice\u2019 to actions caused by\nother persons. So, we might think that if \\(B\\) is drowning because\n\\(A\\) pushed her overboard, \\(B\\) is the victim of injustice; whereas,\nif she accidentally fell overboard, \\(B\\) is the victim of natural\nmisfortune. Some philosophers (such as libertarians) have argued that\nthese natural misfortunes do not trigger duties of justice for others.\nHowever, this position is far from universally accepted. Others, like\nGoodin, argue vulnerability triggers duties of justice regardless of\nthe source of the duress. So, even if \\(A\\) is not responsible for\n\\(B\\) being in the water, justice may require that he provide her with\naid. If \\(A\\) has such a moral duty to aid \\(B\\), but threatens to\nwithhold aid in order to induce \\(A\\) to pay him, he coerces her\n(according to many prominent analyses of coercion) and when \\(A\\)\nbenefits from this coercion, he exploits \\(B\\).\n\nThe extension of duties of justice to duress or vulnerability caused\nby natural misfortune handles some cases that motive a rejection of\nthe claim that antecedent injustice is not necessary for exploitation,\nbut this move is less appealing for cases in which a person\u2019s\ndisadvantage is self-caused. Suppose that rather than \\(A\\)\npushing her or the sea rocking her overboard, \\(B\\) jumped into the\nocean on purpose. Suppose that she immediately regrets her decision\nand asks \\(A\\) for rescue. While we might accept that \\(A\\) may be\npermitted to charge her more for rescue in this case than in\nsituations involving natural disadvantage, many still believe fairness\nplaces some limit on the gains \\(A\\) can extract. Consequently, as\nWertheimer, Vrousalis, and Zwolinski have argued, it appears that\n\\(A\\) can still take unfair advantage of \\(B\\) despite the absence of\nany antecedent injustice. One might continue to resist by arguing that\n\\(A\\)\u2019s self-harm constitutes an injustice to herself, yet such\na position is difficult to maintain and would certainly stretch the\nordinary understanding of the scope of justice.\n\nAt this point, defenders of historical accounts might opt for an\nalternative defence, arguing that if the disadvantage that B uses to\nexploit \\(A\\) is indeed one that she is responsible for bringing\nabout, then \\(B\\) does not exploit her when he benefits from\nthis disadvantage. Support for this position is provided by the moral\nhazard objection, mentioned above: if \\(A\\) knows the consequences of\nher actions will be subsidised by \\(B\\) (by placing a constraint on\nthe advantage \\(B\\) can reap from his future interactions with \\(A\\)),\nthen \\(A\\) has an incentive to take risks, the consequences of which\nare at least partly borne by \\(A\\) (Ferguson 2016b). There is also an\nintermediate position available here. We might acknowledge that if\n\\(B\\) is responsible for her plight, then \\(A\\) is permitted to gain\nfrom \\(B\\)\u2019s disadvantage, while also placing limits on the\namount of gain that \\(A\\) can extract in such circumstances. As Serena\nOlsaretti has argued, the grounds of responsibility, which concern\n\u201cthe features of people that we can \u2026 hold them\nresponsible for\u201d differ from the fairness of the\n\u2018stakes\u2019 of their choices, the costs \u201cattach[ed] to\nwhatever features constitute the justifiable grounds of\nresponsibility\u201d (Olsaretti 2009: 170). An account of just stakes\nmay therefore be used to make space for this intermediate position,\nwhere \\(A\\) can gain from \\(B\\)\u2019s self-caused vulnerability, but\nonly within certain limits.\n\nWhether historical injustice is necessary for exploitation remains an\nopen debate amongst exploitation theorists, with the main points of\ncontention centred around scope of justice and the plausibility of any\nproffered bullet biting response (possibly tempered by the\nintermediate position).\n\nThe second objection to Roemer\u2019s account is that his domination\ncondition is ad hoc and unsatisfactory. As Kymlicka points\nout, the condition is ad hoc since it is \u201cdisconnected\nfrom the \u2018ethical imperative\u2019 [the distribution of\nproductive assets] that [Roemer] identifies as the basis of\nexploitation theory\u201d (Kymlicka 2002: 204 n. 13). And Roemer\nhimself admits that lack of clarity regarding the concept of dominance\nprevents his account from being a \u201csatisfactory analytical\naccount of exploitation\u201d (Roemer 1982b: 304 n. 12).\n\nThe motivation for the addition of a domination condition comes from\ncases like the following, from Jon Elster:\n\n\nConsider a hypothetical society in which there are two groups of\npeople, of equal size and with equal assets. They do not interact\neconomically, that is, they produce and consume in isolation from each\nother. But they interact ideologically in the following way. Group\n\\(R\\) has a puritan religion that makes the members work long hours\nand produce much, but the religion only motivates them to work if they\nhave before their eyes the lazy group \\(S\\) whom they smugly believe\nto be condemned to eternal suffering. Group \\(S\\) members work short\nhours, because they wrongly think that the rigid and to them abhorrent\nlife style of group \\(R\\) is due to the long working hours, not to the\nreligion. (Elster 1982: 369)\n\n\nAs Elster points out, \\(S\\) would be better off if they withdrew with\ntheir per capita assets, and R would be worse off. Thus, group \\(R\\)\nexploits \\(S\\). Yet, this appears to be the wrong result. The\nintuitive result to such cases is that the interaction between the\ngroups isn\u2019t of the right sort for it to count as a case of\nexploitation. It appears that we need something like a domination\ncondition to qualify the kinds of behaviour that are appropriately\ndescribed as exploitation. If one assumes that exploitation is a\npurely distributive phenomenon, then Roemer\u2019s account, sans\ndomination fails. Indeed, it is unclear how cases like Elster\u2019s\ncould be handled by tweaking the distributive conditions alone.\n\nYet, we needn\u2019t accept the assumption that exploitation is\npurely distributive. We might, instead, adopt a two-factor account,\nwhere exploitation requires both the presence of unfairness and the\npresence of something like domination.\n\nIndeed, as Benjamin Ferguson has argued, the most prominent accounts\nof fair transaction make unfair transactions pervasive. If\nexploitation is tantamount to unfair transaction, then exploitations\nare pervasive too. Yet, as he argues, if nearly all transactions are\nexploitative, \u201cthen what is the point of singling out particular\npractices, such as commercial surrogacy, sweatshops, and price gouging\nas wrongfully exploitative?\u201d (Ferguson 2020: 536). Furthermore,\nthe problem isn\u2019t merely that exploitation might be\nwidespread\u2014after all, he notes, many other wrongs might also be\nwidespread. Rather, the pervasiveness of unfair transaction is such\nthat we can have good evidence to believe that a transaction is unfair\n(and thus, for purely distributive accounts exploitative) without\nknowing which party benefits unfairly. In such cases it would be\ninappropriate to blame either of the transactors, which, he argues,\n\u201cconflicts with the ordinary intuition that exploiters are\nmorally responsible and blameworthy for exploiting\u201d (Ferguson\n2020: 537). Ferguson argues that these problems can be overcome by\nappending a second condition that refers to exploiters\u2019\nattitudes to the standard requirement that exploitations are unfair.\nIn the next section we consider three \u2018attitudinal\nconditions\u2019 that might be appended to the unfairness\nrequirement.\n2.3 Attitudinal Conditions\n\nAccounts of exploitation that depart from the traditional analysis\nthat relies only on unfairness generally append one of three\nattitudinal conditions. They claim that in addition to, or in place of\nunfairness, exploitation involves either domination, disrespect, or an\nawareness of one\u2019s unfair advantage. In this section we survey\neach of these approaches.\n2.3.1 Disrespect and Domination\n\nAlthough many accounts of exploitation reference disrespect,\nrelatively few characterise disrespect as an independent condition for\nexploitation. For example, Ruth Sample has argued that there are three\nways we might fail to respect the value another person: \u201cby\nneglecting what is necessary for their wellbeing\u2026by taking\nadvantage of an injustice\u2026and by commodifying, or treating as a\nfungible object of market exchange, an aspect of that person\u2019s\nbeing that ought not to be commodified\u201d (2003:57). Later Sample\nacknowledges that, on its own, improper commodification does not lead\nto exploitation. Rather, improper commodification is one\ncharacteristic consequence of a prior vulnerability. Thus, her forms\nof disrespect reduce to taking advantage of past injustice and failing\nto meet basic needs.\n\nWhile these two behaviours are no doubt disrespectful, they are also\nforms of transactional unfairness (discussed in section 2.2). In this\ncase, an appeal to disrespect offers a deeper analysis by explaining\nwhat is wrong with the unfairness involved in exploitation, but it\ndoes not act as an additional necessary or sufficient condition for\nexploitation.\n\nSimilarly, Jonathan Wolff has argued that \u201cto exploit someone is\nto make use of their circumstances in a way which fails properly to\nacknowledge their standing as an end in themself\u201d (1999: 113).\nHe then points out that the different traditions in moral\nphilosophy\u2014Kantian, Aristotelian, and Utilitarian\u2014offer\ndifferent accounts of what it means to treat others as ends in\nthemselves. Yet, on Wolff\u2019s analysis, each of these accounts\nends up returning to fairness. For example, Wolff argues that \u201cA\nKantian interpretation of the baseline for\nexploitation\u2014motivated by taking a Kantian interpretation of\nwhat it is to be an end in itself\u2014leads us to a\n\u2018fairness\u2019 norm. Kantian exploitation \u2026 is to use\nanother person\u2019s vulnerable circumstances to obtain their actual\ncompliance with a situation that violates norms of fairness\u201d\n(1999: 114). Both Wolff\u2019s and Sample\u2019s analyses of the\nrelationship between exploitation, unfairness, and disrespect are\nplausible, but neither characterizes disrespect as an\nadditional condition that limits the scope of exploitation.\nIf we want to avoid the problems for purely distributive accounts that\nElster and Ferguson raise, we require conditions that do more than\ncharacterise exploitation as a distributively unfair transactional\noutcome.\n\nAn account that clearly distinguishes disrespect and unfairness is\nNicholas Vrousalis\u2019s domination-based account of exploitation.\nFor Vrousalis, disrespect involves acting towards another in a way\nthat is not \u201cdialogically endorsable\u201d that is, acting in a\nway that gives one \u201creason to feel shame or guilt for putting or\nallowing a particular form of justification for some putative act on\nthe table of discourse\u201d (2013: 140). Domination is a subset of\ndisrespect that involves \u201c\\(A\\) getting \\(B\\) to take\n[\\(A\\)\u2019s] power over \\(B\\) as a reason for \\(B\\) to perform the\npower-directed act\u201d (2021: 110). And exploitation is a subset of\ndominating acts that \u201cobtains when the power-directed act,\nperformed for the power-given reason, is geared towards \\(A\\)\u2019s\nenrichment\u201d (2021: 110). Thus, exploitations involve domination\nand domination disrespect. But crucially, for Vrousalis, unfairness is\nnot a necessary condition for exploitation because fairness \u201cis\nresponsibility constrained equality\u201d, but \u201cexploitation\ncan arise from any material inequality\u201d (2013: 149,\nemphasis added). For Vrousalis, exploitation is a dividend of\ndomination induced servitude, though not necessarily unfair.\n\nUnlike Sample\u2019s and Wolff\u2019s appeals to disrespect,\nVrousalis\u2019s domination condition is distinct from the unfairness\ncondition. However, it is unclear that Vrousalis\u2019s account can\ndo a better job of capturing intuitions about the scope of\nexploitation because, as Richard Arneson (2016) points out, it is\ndifficult to see how the use of others\u2019 vulnerabilities for\nself-enrichment is wrong if such use is not also unfair. He argues\n\u201cOne can readily identify examples in which people exploit the\nweaknesses of others\u2014use these vulner- abilities to secure\nadvantages for themselves\u2014but in which there is no unfair\ndivision of advantages from the interaction and so nothing that\nqualifies as morally objectionable exploitation\u201d (2016: 10). For\nexample, suppose \\(A\\) is selling sandwiches and \\(B\\) is hungry. In\nsuch a case, \\(B\\) is vulnerable to \\(A\\): \\(A\\) controls a good that\n\\(B\\) desires and which contributes to her wellbeing. \\(A\\) can take\nadvantage of this vulnerability to make a profit by selling \\(B\\) a\nsandwich. If \\(B\\) had her own sandwich with her she would not be\nwilling to pay \\(A\\) for one of his, thus \\(A\\) can make use of\n\\(B\\)\u2019s hunger to get her to pay him for the food. But unless\nthe price \\(A\\) charges is also unfair\u2014perhaps because \\(A\\) is\nthe only seller, perhaps because \\(B\\) lacks a sandwich due to\ninjustice, and so on\u2014it is hard to see how \\(A\\)\u2019s\nsandwich sale is wrong. Contrary to Vrousalis\u2019s claims, it seems\nthat unfairness is a necessary condition for exploitation.\n2.3.2 Awareness\n\nAlthough exploitation requires unfairness, it also seems to involve\nmore than unfairness. As Wolff puts it, \u201csomehow, there just\nseems to be more to exploitation than unequal exchange\u201d (1999:\n107). Benjamin Ferguson has argued that exploitation is best\ncharacterised by a two factor account, such that \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\nin a transaction iff \\(A\\) gains unfairly from \\(B\\) in the\ntransaction and \\(A\\) believes, or ought to have believed,\nthat the gains he receives wrong \\(B\\) (2020: 535). Ferguson argues\nthat this two-factor account solves two problems for existing accounts\nof exploitation. The first, which we have already seen, is the scope\nproblem: if exploitation is merely tantamount to unfair transaction,\nthen it seems that the scope of exploitation is too broad. The second\nproblem is the blame problem. Ferguson argues that the best accounts\nof transactional fairness entail that unfair transactions are\npervasive: the next transaction that you or I engage in is likely\nunfair. However, in most transactions we don\u2019t know which party\nis gaining too much and which party is gaining too little. This\nepistemic consequence of pervasive unfairness means that we have no\nreason to blame either party of the transaction. Yet, blame\ntypically accompanies charges of exploitation. To say that \\(A\\)\nexploits \\(B\\) is to say that \\(A\\) has done something for which he\ncan be blamed.\n\nFerguson points out that in the subset of unfair transactions where\n\\(A\\) gains unfairly from \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) knows he gains\nunfairly from \\(B\\), we can blame \\(A\\) because \\(A\\) satisfies\nepistemic conditions for moral responsibility. And, of course, the\nscope of exploitation is constrained by the addition of this knowledge\nrequirement. However, knowledge may be too restrictive for\ntwo reasons.\n\nFirst, if knowledge requires something like justified true belief,\n\\(A\\) can believe he gains unfairly from \\(B\\) and his belief can be\ntrue, without \\(A\\) knowing he gains unfairly if\n\\(A\\)\u2019s belief isn\u2019t properly formed, that is, if his\nbelief is unjustified. Suppose \\(A\\) thinks his transaction with \\(B\\)\nis unfair because he mistakenly accepts a false account of\ntransactional fairness. Further, suppose that the true account of\ntransactional fairness\u2014whatever it may be\u2014and the false\naccount both entail that \\(A\\)\u2019s transaction with \\(B\\) is\nunfair. If \\(A\\) believes the transaction is unfair on the basis of\nthe false account, he lacks justification for this belief and so does\nnot know that the transaction is unfair. If exploitation\nrequires \\(A\\) to know the transaction is unfair, but \\(A\\) does not\nhave this knowledge he does not exploit. Yet, intuitively, such cases\nstill seem exploitative\u2014indeed, it still seems appropriate to\nblame \\(A\\) for engaging in a transaction he believed was unfair (and\nthat was unfair, albeit for different reasons than those \\(A\\) thought\nmade it unfair).\n\nSecond, in some cases \\(A\\) may fail to form the belief that a\ntransaction is unfair due to bias in his selection of evidence or how\nhe weighs evidence. For example, consider slavery. If any kind of\nrelation is exploitative, surely slavery is. Some slave holders surely\nknew slavery was unfair and yet continued to engage in the practice.\nBut suppose some held false beliefs about a \u2018natural\u2019\nhierarchy of races. In such a case they might fail to believe their\ninteractions were unfair. Yet, their holding these false beliefs\namounts to negligence: they were surely presented with evidence that\ncontradicted them.\n\nChanging the condition from knowledge to belief and making room for\nnegligence addresses these problems, but even this relatively weak\ncondition encounters problems, as Ferguson shows in the following\ncase:\n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) believes exploitation does not involve unfairness, but\nonly domination tout court. \\(A\\) believes he dominates \\(B\\), he\nbelieves transacting with her will exploit her, but as a domination\ntheorist, he does not believe the transaction will be unfair. Suppose\nthat \\(A\\) nevertheless transacts with \\(B\\) and his belief that it is\na fair transaction is false. (2020: 542\u201343)\n\n\nIt is hard to deny that \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\) in such a scenario, yet\nhe does not believe the transaction is unfair, and so does not satisfy\nthe belief-or-negligence condition. This counterexample can be\naddressed by modifying the proposition that \\(A\\) is required to\nbelieve. We needn\u2019t require \\(A\\) to believe (or be negligent in\nfailing to believe) \u2018that the transaction is unfair\u2019 but\nonly the more general proposition \u2018that the gains he receives\nwrong \\(B\\)\u2019. Thus, Ferguson argues we can appropriately\nrestrict the scope of purely distributive accounts and ascribe blame\nto exploiters if we understand exploitation as: \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\niff (1) \\(A\\) transacts unfairly with \\(B\\) and (2) \\(A\\) believes the\ngains he receives in the transaction wrong \\(B\\).\n3. The Moral Weight and Force of Exploitation\n\nThe primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the\ntruth conditions for the claim, \u201c\\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\u201d.\nBeyond this purely conceptual project, however, there remain two more\nstraightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting terminology from Alan\nWertheimer, we can describe the first of these tasks as providing an\naccount of the moral weight of exploitation, where moral\nweight refers to the intensity of exploitation\u2019s wrongness. The\nsecond task is to provide an account of the moral force of\nexploitation, where moral force is understood to refer to \u201cthe\nvarious moral upshots of reasons for action that exploitation might or\nmight not involve for parties to the transaction or for society\u201d\n(Wertheimer 1996: 28).\n\nWhen exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral\nweight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added\nmoral importance of the gain to \\(A\\) from the harm to \\(B\\), it is\ncertainly at least prima facie wrong for \\(A\\) to harm \\(B\\)\nand it seems that the state is at least prima facie justified\nin prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But\nexploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous\nand consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems.\nFirst, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that\neven if a transaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is unfair, there can be\nnothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which both\nparties benefit, particularly if \\(A\\) has no obligation to enter into\nany transaction with \\(B\\). At the very least, it seems difficult to\nshow how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction can be\nmorally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex\nhypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is\nworse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been\nformulated more precisely as the \u201cnon-worseness\nclaim\u201d:\n\nNWC: Interaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) cannot be worse than\nnon-interaction when \\(A\\) has a right not to interact with \\(B\\) at\nall, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous, consensual,\nand free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996, 2011; Zwolinski\n2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012).\n\nMost exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct\n(Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist\n2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame\nindividuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial\nexploitation\u2014for example, those who engage in \u201cprice\ngouging\u201d by selling electrical generators to victims of natural\ndisasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually\nwould not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing.\nBut, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no\ncoercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the\ntransaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to\nprovide those customers with some benefit than it is to\nprovide them with no benefit at all?\n\nOf course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the\nwrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an\ninflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In\nother words, we can account for the NWC\u2019s claim that mutually\nbeneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction\neither by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is\nless wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that\nnon-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price\ngougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those\nwho stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are\nmore blameworthy than we thought.\n\nEven if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral\nwrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state\nintervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of\nthe moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by\nreference to its moral weight. Suppose \\(A\\) is a price gouger who\nsells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if \\(A\\)\nacts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that \\(A\\)\ndoes not harm anyone or violate anyone\u2019s rights, and only harm\nor rights violations justify state intervention. If the state cannot\nforce \\(A\\) to sell the water to \\(B\\), it might be thought completely\nirrational for the state to prohibit \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) from\nentering into a consensual and mutually advantageous transaction.\n\nMoreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial\nbut exploitative transactions will wind up \u201cconsigning the\nvulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited\u201d\n(Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken\nadvantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability\u2014a lack of\naccess to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing\nexploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate\nthis vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one\npossibility for improving their situation by engaging in a\nmutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually\nexacerbate it.\n\nPerhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on\nexternalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state\nis justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is\nviolating the other\u2019s rights. That said, those who invoke the\nconcept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation\nprovides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is\nclaimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the\ncritics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be\nunenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about\nthe sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently\nclaim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they\nseem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are\nconsensual and mutually advantageous.\n\nOn what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and\nmutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought\nthat we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic\nargument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions\nif the exploitative transaction is advantageous to \\(B\\) and if\ninterference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more\nbeneficial to \\(B\\). For paternalism justifies interfering for\nsomeone\u2019s good, and this interference would not be to the\ntarget\u2019s benefit. But there might be situations in which \\(B\\)\nknows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions that are\nbeneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not know that\nless exploitative transactions are available. And so there may be a\n\u201csoft paternalist\u201d justification for interference with\nsome mutually advantageous exploitative transactions.\n\nWe might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on\nstrategic grounds. Suppose that \\(A\\) enjoys a monopoly position, say,\nas a potential rescuer of \\(B\\). If we prohibit \\(A\\) from charging an\nexorbitant price for his services, then \\(A\\) might offer his services\nfor a reasonable price. This argument would not justify interfering in\na highly competitive market, for, under such conditions, \\(A\\) would\nnot and could not offer his services for a better price. But there may\nbe numerous situations in which such strategic arguments can work\n(Wertheimer 1996).\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative\ntransactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral\nagents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is\nan example of what Allen Wood describes as \u201cinterference\u201d.\nBut in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of\nredistribution as a way in which third parties such as the\nstate might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After\nall, exploitation is only possible because \\(B\\) is in a position of\nvulnerability relative to \\(A\\) . One way to prevent exploitation,\nthen, is to address this vulnerability directly\u2014to channel\nresources to \\(B\\) so as to remove the hardship that makes him\nvulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the\ndeveloping world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on,\nfor instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the\nharsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to\nexploitation by their employers.\n4. Applied Issues in Exploitation Theory\n\nQuestions about exploitation arise in a wide variety of different\ncontexts, not just in the domain of political philosophy but in\nvarious areas of applied ethics as well such as business ethics,\nbiomedical ethics, and environmental ethics. In addition to the topics\ndiscussed briefly below, the concept of exploitation has played a\ncentral role in debates over payday lending (Mayer 2003), clinical\nresearch in the developing world (Hawkins and Emanuel 2008), markets\nfor human organs (Hughes 1998; Taylor 2005), guest worker programs\n(Mayer 2005), and price gouging (Zwolinski 2008).\n4.1 Universal Basic Income\n\nSome theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice\nrequires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A\nUBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all\ncitizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are\nworking, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some\ncritics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of\nexploitation. As Stuart White argues,\n\n\nwhere others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of\ncooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended\nbenefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear\nthe cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this\nscheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317\u2013318)\n\n\nAs is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing\nthis objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of\nempirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance,\nwe might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a\nnet increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have\nargued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work\nrelative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the\neffective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966).\nOthers have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such\nas domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a\nfairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems\nthat condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004).\nNormatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the\nideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of\nbroader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have\nargued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and\nrequires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent\nand the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity\nmay be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is\none that is to be applied only after people have been given\nwhat they are due at the basic level of justice.\n4.2 Sweatshop Labor\n\nThe term \u201csweatshop\u201d is usually used to refer places of\nemployment that utilize low-skill workers, often in the developing\nworld, and that are characterized by low wages, long hours, and unsafe\nworking conditions. In many cases, sweatshops produce goods on\ncontract for large, multinational enterprises, who then sell those\ngoods to customers in wealthier societies.\n\nMany critics see sweatshop labor as highly exploitative. A large part\nof the debate over this claim has focused on the issue of wages.\nCritics claim that sweatshops have a moral obligation to pay a living\nwage to their workers. This duty is grounded in the extreme need of\nsweatshop workers, the fact that sweatshops and the multinational\nenterprises with which they contract rely on them to produce the goods\nthat they sell, and the fact that the multinational enterprises are\nprofitable enough that they can afford to increase workers\u2019\nwages without jeopardizing the health of their business (Meyers 2004;\nSnyder 2008). Some critics, however, see sweatshops\u2019 low wages\nas merely one symptom of a broader failure to respect workers as\npersons who are ends in themselves. That failure of respect manifests\nitself in sweatshops violation of legal labor standards, their\nexposure of workers to physically dangerous conditions, and their\nabuse and coercion of workers on the job (Arnold and Bowie 2003:\n227\u2013233).\n\nOnce again, a number of difficult empirical and normative issues come\nout in this debate. The empirical issues include not only questions\nabout what conditions in sweatshops are actually like\u2014how low\nwages actually are relative to other firms in the developing economy,\nfor instance\u2014but what effects various attempts to remedy\nsweatshop conditions would actually have. Would a higher legal minimum\nwage improve workers\u2019 overall well-being, or would it instead\nlead to layoffs and plant relocations (Powell and Zwolinski 2012)? On\nthe normative side, the Non-Worseness Condition seems to pose an\nespecially significant challenge to critics of sweatshop labor. If\nsweatshops, by providing jobs and capital infusion in the developing\nworld, provide some benefit to workers there, how can they be\nacting in a morally worse way than wealthy firms that do not outsource\ntheir production at all, and thus provide no benefit to needy\nworkers abroad (Zwolinski 2007; Preiss 2014)? Another question: even\nif we grant that sweatshops exploit their workers, and that\nexploitation is a significant moral wrong, might it be a wrong that is\nall-things-considered justifiable if sweatshop labor nevertheless\nconfers considerable benefits on current workers, and plays an\nimportant role in economic growth? In other words, how much weight\nshould a valid claim of exploitation have in our overall judgment of\nthe justice of a practice or of a set of institutions that permit that\npractice?\n4.3 Commercial Surrogacy\n\nCommercial surrogacy is a practice in which a woman is paid to become\npregnant as a result of either artificial insemination or the\nimplantation of an already fertilized egg, and to surrender her\nparental rights to the intended parent(s). In the United States, most\nsurrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the\nintended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United\nStates), but a significant number are international, in which the\nsurrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country.\n\nBoth types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism\non a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy\ninvolves an objectionable form of \u201ccommodification\u201d, while\nothers have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to\nwomen as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits\nthe women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international\nsurrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and\nlow pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative\nsources of employment has been said to undermine women\u2019s\nconsent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low\ncompared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same\nservice\u2014sometimes as low as 10%.\n\nIn the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate\nmothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and\npsychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to\nprovide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them\ndespite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not\nharmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate\ncompensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case\nof mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong\n1990).\n\nQuestions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same\nissues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the\nliterature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of\nlabor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that\ncommercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If\nwomen\u2019s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that\nshould be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may\ninvolve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage\nin an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson\n1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).\n",
