    "main_text": "Formal Theories of Facts || Facts and Worlds\n2.1 Facts and Worlds\n\nMany metaphysicians are interested in the modal sphere. They do not\nonly want to determine which entities there actually are and\ntheir actual properties. They wish to formulate claims with\nmodal content, they want to determine which entities there\ncan or must be, and which are their properties\nacross all (metaphysically) possible worlds.\n\nIn this section we deal with some basic modal issues related to facts.\nMore precisely, we shall present and compare certain principles\ninvolving facts and (possible) worlds. Although at some places we\nshall mention the view that worlds are themselves facts, or sets or\npluralities or sums of facts, we shall remain neutral as to the nature\nof worlds.\n\nLet \\(W\\) be the set of all possible worlds, \\(F\\) the function which\nassigns to each world \\(w\\) the set \\(F_w\\) of facts which exist in\nit, and \\(F\\) the union of all the \\(F_w s\\), i.e., the set of all\nfacts. We assume that \\(W\\) has infinitely many members. This is a\nreasonable assumption, which will have some importance in what follows\nwith respect to certain entailment claims we are going to make (not\nhaving the assumption would force us to distinguish cases). Since we\nare dealing with theories of facts, we shall also assume that \\(F\\) is\nnon-empty. Although perhaps there are impossible states of affairs or\nsituations, we take it that there are no impossible facts. That is why\nthere is no room for them in our framework.\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is a fact, \\(\\ES(x)\\) (the existence-set of\n\\(x\\)) is the set of all worlds at which \\(x\\) exists. And where \\(G\\)\nis a set of facts, \\(\\CES(G)\\) (the conjunctive-existence-set\nof \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cap_{x\\in G} \\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at\nwhich all elements of \\(G\\) exist, and \\(\\DES(G)\\) (the\ndisjunctive-existence-set of \\(G\\)) is \\(\\cup_{x\\in G}\n\\ES(x)\\), i.e., the set of worlds at which some elements of \\(G\\)\nexist. Notice that \\(\\CES(\\varnothing) = W\\), \\(\\DES(\\varnothing) =\n\\varnothing\\), and that given any \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\), \\(\\CES(G)\n\\subseteq \\DES(G)\\). (Here and elsewhere, we borrow some vocabulary\nand symbolism from Fine 1982.)\n2.1.1 Some Characterization Principles\n\nWe shall say that a set of facts \\(G\\) characterizes a set of\nworlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) = V\\), and that a fact \\(x\\)\ncharacterizes a set of worlds \\(V\\) iff \\(\\ES(x) = V\\) (no\nconfusion should arise from the ambiguity of\n\u2018characterize\u2019). At this very early point some work can\nalready be done.\n\nWe assume the following definitions:\n\n\\(F^{\\#} =\\) the set of all contingent facts (i.e., of all facts\nwhose existence-set is not \\(W\\));\n\\(P(F) =\\) the set of all sets of facts;\n\\(P(F)^* =\\) the set of all non-empty sets of facts;\n\\(\\pi(F) =\\) the set of all sets of facts \\(G\\) with \\(G \\ne\n\\varnothing\\) and \\(\\CES(G) \\ne \\varnothing\\).\n\n\nOf special interest are the following Boolean principles\n(\u2018\\(\\setsub\\)\u2019 refers to the operation of set-theoretic\nsubtraction):\n\nB1.If \\(x\\in F^{\\#}\\),\nthen some fact characterizes \\(W \\setsub \\ES(x)\\);\nB2.If \\(G\\in \\pi(F)\\),\nthen some fact characterizes \\(\\CES(G)\\); \nB3.If \\(G\\in P(F)^*\\),\nsome fact characterizes \\(\\DES(G)\\); \nB4.Some fact\ncharacterizes \\(W\\). \n\n\nIf facts can be negated, then the negation of fact \\(x\\) (if any) will\nhave existence-set \\(W \\setsub \\ES(x)\\). If facts can be conjoined,\nthen the conjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have\nexistence-set \\(\\CES(G)\\). And if facts can be disjoined, then the\ndisjunction of the facts in set \\(G\\) (if any) will have existence-set\n\\(\\DES(G)\\). One can then understand why we call these principles\n\u2018Boolean\u2019.\n\nB1 and B3 together entail B4. Assuming B1 and B4, B2 is equivalent to\nB3. Notice that if it is assumed that every world contains at least\none fact (a principle we shall call \u2018Plenitude\u2019),\nthen B3 implies B4 (take \\(G = F)\\). Also notice that both B1 and B4\nentail Plenitude. See Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nIt is tempting to adopt the principle:\n\n\nNo Twins. Worlds with the very same facts (twins,\nfor short) are identical, i.e., \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(w = v\\),\ni.e., \\(F\\) is injective.\n\n\nAnother formulation of No Twins might be the following: the\nidentity of a world is completely determined by which facts hold in\nit. No Twins imposes serious constraints on the cardinality\nof \\(F\\). In particular, since there are infinitely many worlds,\nNo Twins implies that there must also be infinitely many\nfacts.\n\nThe B-principles assert the existence of facts characterising various\nsets of worlds. Similar principles of special interest are of the same\nvein:\n\nW1.Every\nworld-singleton is characterized by some non-empty set of\nfacts;\nW2.Every\nworld-singleton is characterized by some fact;\nW3.Every non-empty set\nof worlds is characterized by some non-empty set of facts;\nW4.Every non-empty set\nof worlds is characterized by some fact.\n\n\nThe W-principles have mates of a certain interest:\n\nW\\(1'\\).Every\nsingleton* is characterized by some non-empty set of\nfacts;\nW\\(2'\\).Every\nsingleton* is characterized by some fact;\nW\\(3'\\).Every non-empty\nset* is characterized by some non-empty set of facts;\nW\\(4'\\).Every non-empty\nset* is characterized by some fact.\n\n\nA set* is a set of worlds which contains all twins of its\nmembers \\((\\varnothing\\) and \\(W\\) are then sets*), and a\nsingleton* is a set* whose members are all twins. Notice that\nall existence-sets, conjunctive existence-sets and disjunctive\nexistence-sets, as well as their complements in \\(W\\), are sets*.\n\nW4 entails both W2 and W3, and in turn each of them entails W1. All\nthe same, W\\(4'\\) entails both W\\(2'\\) and W\\(3'\\), and in turn each\nof them entails W\\(1'\\). No Twins is a consequence of W1.\nUnder the assumption that No Twins is true, each W\\(i\\) is\nequivalent to W\\(i'\\). So each W\\(i\\) entails W\\(i'\\). W\\(4'\\) entails\nall the Bs. W\\(1'\\) entails Plenitude. W4 is thus an\nextremely strong principle, since it entails all the principles we\nhave met so far. See Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nW\\(4'\\) is equivalent to B\\(2 +\\) W\\(3'\\), W\\(2'\\) plus B3 yields\nW\\(4'\\), W\\(1'\\) plus B2 yields W\\(2'\\). B1 yields W\\(1'\\). See Figure\n3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nAll the previous principles are compatible with there being distinct\nfacts existing at exactly the very same worlds. One may wish to deny\nthat this is possible, and adopt:\n\n\nModal Criterion. Two facts are identical if they have the\nsame existence-set, i.e., \\(x = y\\) whenever \\(\\ES(x) = \\ES(y)\\).\n\n\nThis provides a modal criterion for the identity of facts. If\nModal Criterion is accepted, each B-principle is equivalent\nto the result of replacing in the principle \u2018some fact\u2019 by\n\u2018a unique fact\u2019. The same holds of W2, W\\(2'\\), W4 and\nW\\(4'\\).\n\nModal Criterion is controversial. One may wish to claim that\nthere are such things as the fact that Socrates exists, the fact that\nSocrates exists and every number is a number, and the fact that\nsingleton [Socrates] exists, and that all or some of these facts are\ndistinct. But given plausible assumptions about the\nexistence-conditions of these facts, they all have the same\nexistence-set.\n\nModal Criterion holds in the views put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP, Suszko 1968 and Fine 1982 (in theories\nF(A)-Cond and C-Cond). It does not hold in Fine\u2019s theory F-Cond\n(Fine 1982) and Zalta\u2019s theory (Zalta 1991), under the two\ninterpretations indeed. References relative to previous principles\nwill be given later on. More detail is available in the\n supplementary document on Some Formal Theories in the Literature.\n2.1.2 Facts as Sets of Worlds, Worlds as Facts, Worlds as Sets (or Pluralities, or Sums) of Facts\n\nThere is a view according to which propositions are sets of worlds.\nOne might prefer to identify facts with sets of worlds (this\nis what is done in Restall 2004). On this view, for every fact \\(x\\),\n\\(\\ES(x) = x\\), and for every world \\(w, F_w = \\{x : x\\in F\\) and\n\\(w\\in x\\}\\). Modal Criterion is then satisfied. Suppose that\nall non-empty sets of worlds are facts. This is a very natural option\nfor the view under consideration, and is actually countenanced by\nRestall. Then the strong W4 is satisfied.\n\nOn a dual view, worlds are taken to be sets of facts, a world being\nidentified with its own domain: for every world \\(w, F_w = w\\). On\nthat view, No Twins is trivially true. Variants on that view\ntake worlds to be pluralities, or mereological sums of facts.\nCresswell (Cresswell 1972) is in the set camp, Wittgenstein\n(TLP), it seems, in the plurality camp.\n\nStill another view is that worlds are themselves facts (Suszko 1968,\nPlantinga 1974 and Zalta 1991). A natural claim, on that view, is that\neach world belongs to its own domain and to it only, i.e., that for\nevery world \\(w\\), \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). If this is accepted, No\nTwins and W2 are true.\n\nHere is a simple theory which goes in that direction (Wolniewicz\n1982). Let us take the notion of a fact containing another\nfact as a primitive. We shall use \u2018\\(x \\le y\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018\\(x\\) is contained in \\(y\\)\u2019, and we shall take relation\n\\(\\le\\) to be reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. One option is\nto define fact containment in modal terms (i.e., define \u2018\\(x \\le\ny\\)\u2019 as \u2018necessarily, \\(x\\) exists if \\(y\\) does\u2019),\nbut we shall remain neutral on this issue.\n\nLet us define a world as a maximal fact under the relation of\nfact-containment: \\(x\\) is a world iff for every fact \\(y\\), if \\(x\n\\le y\\), then \\(x = y\\). We assume that every fact is contained in\nsome world.\n\nWe then define the domain \\(F_w\\) of world \\(w\\) to be the set of all\nfacts \\(w\\) contains. Thus the union of all the domains is the set of\nall facts. Clearly, each world belongs to its own domain and to it\nonly: \\(\\ES(w) = \\{w\\}\\). So (as we previously pointed out) No\nTwins and W2 hold, and Modal Criterion is ensured if we\naccept the principle according to which two facts are identical\nprovided that they are contained in the very same worlds.\n2.2 Boolean Operations on Facts\n\nPropositions can be negated, conjoined and disjoined to other\npropositions. As we previously saw, there is an issue as to whether\nthe same holds of facts. In this section we introduce the Boolean\noperations on facts, and point to the four main views as to which of\nthese operations actually exist.\n\nAn operation of negation on facts is a function \\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{n}}\\)\nwhich satisfies the following axioms:\n\nN1.\\(\\cdot\n^\\textbf{n}\\) is a total function from \\(F^{\\#}\\) to\n\\(F^{\\#}\\);\nN2.If \\(x =\ny^\\textbf{n}\\), then \\(\\ES(x) = W \\setsub \\ES(y)\\);\nN3.\\(x^{\\textbf{nn}} =\nx\\).\n\n\nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B1. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of negation is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B1 are accepted\u2014in particular under\nthe view which takes facts to be sets of worlds; in that case,\nset-complementation is a negation operation.\n\nAn operation of conjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{c}}\\) which obeys the following principles:\n\nC1.\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{c}}\\)\nis a total function from \\(\\pi(F)\\)\nto \\(F\\);\nC2.If \\(x =\nG^{\\textbf{c}}\\), then \\(\\ES(x) = \\CES(G)\\) (for \\(G\\in\n\\pi(F))\\);\nC3.\\(\\{x\\}^{\\textbf{c}}\n= x\\);\nC4.\\((\\cup_{K\\in G}\nK)^{\\textbf{c}} = (\\cup_{K\\in G}\n\\{K^{\\textbf{c}}\\})^{\\textbf{c}}\\).\n\n\nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B2. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of conjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B2 are accepted\u2014in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, intersection is a\nconjunction operation.\n\nFinally, an operation of disjunction on facts is a function\n\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{d}}\\) which has the following properties:\n\nD1.\\(\\cdot^{\\textbf{d}}\\)\nis a total function from \\(P(F)^*\\)\nto \\(F\\);\nD2.If \\(x =\nG^{\\textbf{d}}\\), then \\(\\ES(x) = \\DES(G)\\) (for \\(G\\in\nP(F)^*\\));\nD3.\\(\\{x\\}^{\\textbf{d}}\n= x\\);\nD4.\\((\\cup_{K\\in G}\nK)^{\\textbf{d}} = (\\cup_{K\\in G}\n\\{K^{\\textbf{d}}\\})^{\\textbf{d}}\\).\n\n\nThe existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B3. In\nturn, the existence of an operation of disjunction is ensured if\nModal Criterion and B3 are accepted\u2014in particular under\nthe view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, union is a\ndisjunction operation.\n\nSuppose all three operations are accepted (in which case all the Bs\nare true). It is then possible to define an operation in terms of\nnegation and conjunction which behaves almost exactly like\ndisjunction. Let \\(\\varrho(F)\\) be the set of all sets of facts \\(G\\)\nwith \\(G \\ne \\varnothing\\) and \\(\\DES(G) \\ne W\\). Where \\(H\\) is any\nset of facts, we let \\(\\mathbf{n}H\\) be \\(\\{x^\\textbf{n}\\) : \\(x\\in\nH\\cap F^{\\#}\\}\\), the negative image of \\(H\\). This\ndisjunction-like operation, \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\), is a (total) function\nfrom \\(\\varrho(F)\\) to \\(F^{\\#}\\) defined by the following condition:\n\\(G^{\\delta} = (\\mathbf{n}G)^{\\textbf{{cn}}}\\). \\(\\cdot^{\\delta}\\)\nbehaves like disjunction in that it satisfies the principles resulting\nfrom replacing \u2018\\(P(F)^*\\)\u2019 by\n\u2018\\(\\varrho(F)\\)\u2019 in\nD1\u2013D4.\n\nSome extra principles must then presumably be introduced, as we\npresumably want \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) and \\(^{\\delta}\\) to coincide on\n\\(\\varrho(F)\\). We may just adopt the principle which says this:\n\nD5.If \\(G\\in\n\\varrho(F)\\), then \\(G^{\\textbf{d}} = G^{\\delta}\\).\n\n\nHere is a table indicating, for some theories, which operations they\nallow \\((+\\) means acceptance and \\(-\\) rejection):\n\n\n\u00a0\nnegation\nconjunction\ndisjunction \n\nArmstrong 1997\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 \n\nFine 1982 *\n+ for theory F(A)-Cond\n\n\u2212 for theory C-Cond\n+ for F(A)-Cond\n\n+ for C-Cond\n+ for F(A)-Cond\n\n\u2212 for C-Cond \n\nRestall 2004\n+\n+\n+ \n\nRussell PLA\nneither + nor \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \n\nSuszko 1968 *\n+\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts \n\nTaylor 1985\n+\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts \n\nVan Fraassen 1969 (modalized version) *\n+ for a distinguished class of \u201catomic\u201d facts\nonly\n+\n\u2212 \n\nWittgenstein TLP\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \n\nZalta 1991 first interpretation *\n+\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts \n\nZalta 1991 second interpretation *\n\u2212\n+ restricted to finite collections of facts\n\u2212 \n\n\n(On the entries containing a *, see the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.)\n In the case of Restall, commitment to all three operations directly\nfollows from the fact that his theory validates W4 and Modal\nCriterion. Taylor in fact has no modal theory of facts, but it\nseems that in a natural modal extension of his theory the previously\nmentioned acceptance claims should be correct. The restrictions in\nTaylor\u2019s case are due to the fact that he works with standard\nfirst-order languages. Taylor is concerned with giving a theory of the\nfacts \u201cposited\u201d by standard first-order languages, i.e.,\nof the facts which play a role in determining the truth-values of the\nsentences of that language. Standard first-order languages admit of\nconjunction and disjunction only on finite collections of sentences,\nhence the restrictions relative to facts. But clearly, moving to\nlanguages in which infinite conjunctions and disjunctions are freely\nallowed, the restrictions would vanish.\n\nIn the light of the previous table, there are four main views as to\nwhich Boolean operations are to be accepted:\n\n\\(\\tau_1\\):No Boolean\noperation on facts.\n\\(\\tau_2\\):Only\nnegation on a distinguished class of \u201catomic\u201d facts, and\nconjunction.\n\\(\\tau_3\\):Only\nconjunction.\n\\(\\tau_4\\):All Boolean\noperations. \n\n\n(The restrictions for conjunction and disjunction indicated in the\ntable are due to accidental limitations in expressive power, as we\npointed out for the case of Taylor, and point out for the other cases\nin the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature.)\n2.3 Independency\n\nSay that a set of facts \\(G\\) is independent iff \\(G\\) is not\nempty and any of its subsets \\(H\\) is such that there is a domain\n\\(F_w\\) such that such that \\(G \\cap F_w = H\\). That \\(G\\) is\nindependent means (i) that any collection of facts in \\(G\\) may obtain\ntogether without any other fact in \\(G\\) obtaining, and (ii) that no\nfact in \\(G\\) need obtain.\n\nLet \\(^{\\textbf{n}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{c}}\\), \\(^{\\textbf{d}}\\) be Boolean\noperations, of negation, conjunction and disjunction, respectively.\nWhere \\(G\\) is any set of facts, we put:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{n}G =_{df} \\{x^\\textbf{n}:x\\in G\\cap F^{\\#}\\}\\) (the\nnegative image of \\(G\\));\n\\(\\mathbf{c}G =_{df} \\{H^{\\textbf{c}}:H \\subseteq G, H\\in\n\\pi(F)\\}\\) (the conjunctive closure of \\(G\\));\n\\(\\mathbf{d}G =_{df} \\{H^{\\textbf{d}}:G\\cap H \\ne \\varnothing ,\nH\\in P(F)^*\\}\\)(the disjunctive closure of \\(G\\));\n\\(G\\) is consistent iff for every fact \\(x\\) in\n\\(F^{\\#}\\), not both \\(x\\in G\\) and \\(x^{\\textbf{n}} \\in G\\);\n\\(G\\) is maximal iff \\(\\neg(x\\in G)\\) implies \\(x\\) in\n\\(F^{\\#}\\) and \\(x^{\\textbf{n}} \\in G\\).\n\\(G\\) is conjunctively complete iff for every set of\nfacts \\(H\\) in \\(\\pi(F), H^{\\textbf{c}} \\in G\\) iff \\(H \\subseteq\nG\\).\n\n\nEach world-domain is maximal consistent. Maximal consistency entails\nconjunctive closure, so each world-domain is maximal consistent. A\nmaximal set of facts contains all non-contingent facts (if any), and\nis never empty.\n\nWhere \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) are any set of facts, we shall say that:\n\n\\(H\\) generates \\(G\\) via conjunction iff \\(G =\n\\mathbf{c}H\\);\n\\(H\\) generates \\(G\\) via Booleanization iff \\(G\n= \\mathbf{dc}(H \\cup \\mathbf{n}H)\\).\n\n\nNotice that \\(\\mathbf{dc}(H \\cup \\mathbf{n}H)\\) is the smallest set of\nfacts containing \\(H\\) closed under the Boolean operations.\n\nSuppose there is an independent set \\(H\\). Then if \\(H = F\\) or \\(H\\)\ngenerates \\(F\\) via conjunction, then all facts are contingent.\nMoreover, Modal Criterion holds if \\(H = F\\) or generates\n\\(F\\) via conjunction or Booleanization.\n\nWe shall now consider three particular theories of facts involving the\nnotions of independence and generation:\n\n\\(\\textrm{T}_1\\):\\(\\tau_1\n+\\) \u2018\\(F\\) is\nindependent\u2019;\n\\(\\textrm{T}_3\\):\\(\\tau_3\n+\\) \u2018\\(F\\) is generated by an independent\nset via conjunction\u2019;\n\\(\\textrm{T}_4\\):\\(\\tau_4\n+\\) \u2018\\(F\\) is generated by an independent\nset via Booleanization\u2019.\n\n\nLet \\(\\phi\\) be the function which associates to each singleton* the\ncommon domain of its members. Consider now the following\nprinciples:\n\nCo1.\\(\\phi\\) is a\nbijection from the set of all singletons* onto the set of all sets of\nfacts;\nCo3.\\(\\phi\\) is a\nbijection from the set of all singletons* onto the set of all\nconjunctively complete sets of facts;\nCo4.\\(\\phi\\) is a\nbijection from the set of all singletons* onto the set of all maximal\nconsistent sets of facts.\n\n\nFor \\(i = 1, 3\\) or 4, \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails Co\\(_i\\). If No\nTwins is added to each theory, each \\(\\textrm{T}_i\\) entails the\nprinciple which results from replacing \u2018\\(\\phi\\)\u2019 by\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 and \u2018the set of all singletons\u2019 by\n\u2018\\(W\\)\u2019 in Co\\(_i\\):\n\nCO1.\\(F\\) is a\nbijection from \\(W\\) onto the set of all sets of facts;\nCO3.\\(F\\) is a\nbijection from \\(W\\) onto the set of all conjunctively complete sets\nof facts;\nCO4.\\(F\\) is a\nbijection from \\(W\\) onto the set of all maximal consistent sets of\nfacts.\n\n\nSome properties of our theories are depicted in the following table,\nwhere \u2018+\u2019 means \u2018holds\u2019, \u2018\u2212\u2019\nmeans \u2018fails to hold\u2019 and \u2018?\u2019 means\n\u2018indeterminate\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(\\textrm{T}_1\\)\n\\(\\textrm{T}_3\\)\n\\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) \n\nB1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nB2\n\u2212\n+\n+ \n\nB3\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nB4\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nW1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n? \n\nW2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n? \n\nW3\n\u2212\n\u2212\n? \n\nW4\n\u2212\n\u2212\n? \n\nW\\(1'\\)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nW\\(2'\\)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nW\\(3'\\)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nW\\(4'\\)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nPlenitude\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \n\nNo Twins\n?\n?\n? \n\nModal Criterion\n+\n+\n+  \n\n\nIn the presence of No Twins, \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) entails all the\nWs.\n\n\\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) is a component of Wittgenstein\u2019s logical\natomism in Wittgenstein TLP. It also appears in Cresswell\n1972. Suszko 1968 has something very close to \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) (cf.\nthe supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n\nArmstrong (1997) works with a different notion of independency, which\nwe may call independency*. A set of facts is independent* iff\ngiven any of it subsets \\(G\\) and any of its member \\(x\\) not in\n\\(G\\), it is possible that the members of \\(G\\) exist without \\(x\\),\nand it is also possible that they exist with \\(x\\). Independency is\nstrictly stronger than independency*: The independency*, but not the\nindependency, of a set is compatible with there being a member of that\nset existing in every world (not the same member each time, of\ncourse). Armstrong expresses the hope that the set of atomic facts he\ncountenances is independent*, though he recognizes that there may be\ndifficulties to defend the view. We do not know whether he would\nexpress the hope that the set of atomic facts he countenances is\nindependent tout court. Anyway, even if he held the view he\nwould not endorse \\(\\textrm{T}_3\\), since he recognizes\n\u201ctotality facts\u201d (cf.\n section 2.4.2),\n which are not conjunctions of atomic facts.\n2.4 Facts and Propositions\n\nAs we pointed out above, one view about facts is that to be a fact is\nto be a true proposition. On another, incompatible view, facts are\nwhat make true propositions true, or more generally, account for their\ntruth. The search for what accounts for the truth of propositions is,\nas we have seen, actually one main rationale for the introduction of\nfacts. In what follows we shall deal with the two views.\n\nBy \u2018proposition\u2019, we shall mean truth-bearer, and\nremain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements,\nbeliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for\ninstance\u2014except in\n section 2.4.1.\n\nEach world \\(w\\) has its set \\(\\textrm{T}_w\\) of true propositions,\nand we call \\(\\TS(p)\\) (the truth-set of \\(p\\)) the set of\nall worlds at which \\(p\\) is true. Where \\(p\\) is a proposition, let\n\\(\\ES(p)\\) (the existence-set of \\(p\\)) be the set of all\nworlds at which it exists.\n2.4.1 Facts as True Propositions\n\nLet us consider here the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition. On such a view, propositions cannot be sentences or\nstatements or beliefs. They are, perhaps, abstract entities expressed\nor designated by sentences.\n\nThere is an issue as to what the existence-conditions for propositions\n(taken in that sense, the qualification will be constant in this\nsection) are, which is relevant for the view under consideration. On\none view, propositions exist necessarily, i.e., the existence-set of\nany proposition is \\(W\\), the set of all possible worlds. On another\nview, the existence of a proposition is in general world-relative.\n\nThe world-relative view comes in several variants. Two such variants\nwhich will be of central interest to us correspond to the two possible\nanswers to the question \u2018Can a proposition be true without\nexisting?\u2019. The view that a proposition can be true without\nexisting is quite plausible under the assumption that propositions\nexpressed by sentences which contain proper names are composite\nobjects which literally contain the individuals denoted by these\nnames. For it is plausible to maintain that no whole can exist without\nits parts, and if this and the previously mentioned assumption are\ntrue, then the proposition expressed by \u2018Socrates is not a\nphilosopher\u2019 will turn out true in worlds where it does not\nexist (it is assumed here that there can be no non-existent\nphilosopher, and that Socrates is not a necessary existent). (Against\nthis line of thought, see the discussion of New Actualism in the entry\non\n actualism.)\n\nThere is a conception of propositions according to which they are sets\nof worlds (see, e.g., Stalnaker 1976). On such a conception, the\ntruth-set of a proposition is the proposition itself, and issues about\npropositional existence remain: it may be held that propositions exist\nnecessarily, or that their existence is in general world-relative. The\nfirst option seems intrinsically the most natural, and a proponent of\nthe world-relative view will most naturally identify the existence-set\nof a proposition with its truth-set\u2014or so it seems.\n\nWhere \\(w\\) is a world, let \\(P_w\\) be the set of propositions which\nexists in it, and let \\(P\\) be \\(\\cup_{w\\in W} P_{w}\\), the set of all\npropositions. On the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition, the set of facts which exist in world \\(w\\) is the set of\nall propositions which exist and are true at \\(w\\), i.e., \\(F_{w} =\nT_w \\cap P_{w}\\), and the existence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\ES(x)\n\\cap \\TS(x)\\). (There is a similar view according to which all facts\nare true propositions, while some true propositions\u2014say, the\ncomplex ones\u2014may not be facts, but we leave it aside.) Of\ncourse, under the assumption that no proposition can be true without\nexisting, in particular under the assumption that they exist\nnecessarily, for every world \\(w, F_{w} = T_{w}\\), and the\nexistence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\TS(x)\\).\n\nSuppose that propositions exist necessarily. It is plausible to say\nthat propositions can be freely negated, conjoined and disjoined to\nother propositions. On that view, there are operations of negation,\nconjunction and disjunction of facts which obey the principles we\npreviously introduced. The resulting view is thus extremely strong. If\nnot all propositions exist necessarily, then questions related to the\nBoolean operations receive answers which may vary according to the\nexistence-conditions which are imposed on propositions.\n2.4.2 Making True\n\nAs we have emphasized, one of the main rationale for introducing facts\nhas been to account for the truth of true propositions. The idea is\nthat whenever a proposition is true, its truth is to be explained in\nterms of the existence and / or non-existence of some facts.\n\nA minimal requirement one may wish to impose in that direction is the\nfollowing:\n\n\nSupervenience. \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(T_{w} =\nT_{v}\\).\n\n\nThis says that truth supervenes on facts: no difference in truth\nwithout a difference in facts.\n\nSupervenience is a direct consequence of No Twins,\nbut one may wish to leave open the possibility of distinct worlds\ncontaining the same facts. (On the view that to be a fact is to be a\ntrue proposition, Supervenience trivially holds if it is\nassumed that no proposition can be true if it does not exist. If that\nassumption is dropped, then there is room for Supervenience\nto fail. That might be taken to be an argument for keeping the\nassumption on the view under consideration.)\n\nLet us say that a property \\(\\phi\\) is a fact-condition iff\nit is a binary relation connecting sets of sets of facts and worlds,\nsuch that given any set of sets of facts \\(\\Gamma\\) and any worlds\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\), if \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\), then \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\) iff\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v)\\) (i.e., the holding of the condition supervenes on\nwhich facts there are). The following principle better captures the\nidea that facts account for the truth of true propositions:\n\n\nDetermination. For every proposition \\(p\\) and every world\n\\(w\\) at which it is true, there exists a fact-condition \\(\\phi\\) and\na set \\(\\Gamma\\) of sets of facts such that\n\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\), and\nfor every world \\(v\\) such that \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v), p\\) is true at\n\\(v\\).\n\n\n\nDetermination clearly entails Supervenience.\n\nLet us examine some stronger principles. Let us say that some given\nfacts (jointly) necessitate proposition \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\) is\ntrue in every world where they all exist. The facts in set \\(G\\)\n(jointly) necessitate \\(p\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) \\subseteq \\TS(p)\\). Let us\nalso say that some given facts (jointly) make true\nproposition \\(p\\) in world \\(w\\) iff they all exist in \\(w\\) and they\nnecessitate the proposition. Let us finally say that proposition \\(p\\)\nrepresents some given facts iff in every world where \\(p\\) is\ntrue, some of them exist. Proposition \\(p\\) represents the facts in\n\\(G\\) iff \\(\\TS(p) \\subseteq \\DES(G)\\).\n\nOur definition of truthmaking fails to capture the explanatory\ncharacter of the notion people have usually in mind when they talk\nabout truthmaking. If something makes a given proposition\ntrue, it is usually assumed, then the existence of that thing explains\nthe truth of the proposition. Now it should be clear that truthmaking\nas we have defined it is not explanatory in this sense. For everything\nwhatsoever is a truthmaker (in our sense) for any necessary\nproposition, while arguably, the obtaining of the fact that Philipp\nlives in Geneva fails to explain the truth of your favourite\ntautology. Or again, consider Socrates and its singleton-set,\n[Socrates]. It may be argued, as we previously stressed, that granted\nthat there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists and the\nfact that [Socrates] exists, these two facts obtain in exactly the\nsame worlds. Assume this is the case. Now some may be happy with the\nview that the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in the usual\nsense) for the proposition that Socrates exists\u2014and so with the\nview that the obtaining of the fact explains the truth of the\nproposition, but the view that the truth of that proposition is\nexplained by the obtaining of the fact that the singleton exists is\nhighly implausible. Yet if the fact that Socrates exists is a\ntruthmaker (in our sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists,\nthen the fact that the singleton exists is also a truthmaker (in our\nsense) for that proposition.\n\nRepresentation, as we have defined it, is also quite remote from what\npeople usually have in mind when they speak of propositions\nrepresenting facts: propositions which cannot be true represent (in\nour sense) any fact whatsoever, and if the proposition that Socrates\nexists represents (in our sense) the fact that Socrates exists, then\nit also represents (in our sense) the fact that [Socrates] exists\n(granted that these two facts exist at the same worlds).\n\nDespite the fact that truthmaking as defined above does not to capture\nthe usual concept of making true, we shall not deal with the latter\nconcept here. And we shall not deal either with the usual notion of\nrepresentation.\n\nLet us now turn to the stronger principles. A very strong principle\nconnecting propositions and facts says that for every proposition\n\\(p\\) which can be true, there exists a fact represented by \\(p\\)\nwhich necessitates \\(p\\) (i.e., a fact which makes the proposition\ntrue in every world where it is true). The principle just says that\nfor every proposition which can be true, there is a fact whose\nexistence-set is identical to the proposition\u2019s truth-set:\n\nP1.\\(\\forall p\\in\nP^{\\circ} \\exists x\\in F \\, \\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\n(\\(P^{\\circ}\\) is the set of all propositions which can be true.)\n\nThis is a very strong principle. Under reasonable assumptions, P1\nentails the strong principle W4. For instance, this is so under the\nassumption that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some\nproposition. This assumption trivially holds if sets of worlds are\ntaken to be propositions, but such an assumption is not needed. For\nlet \\(V\\) be any set of worlds. Assume that No Twins is true.\nTo each world \\(w\\) associate the conjunction \\(c_w\\) of all\npropositions true in \\(w\\) (we suppose it exists), and consider the\ndisjunction \\(d_V\\) of all \\(c_w, w\\in V\\) (we suppose it exists).\nThen \\(\\TS(d_V) = V\\).\n\nTheory F(A)-Cond described in Fine 1982 licences P1, as well as the\ntheory put forward in Zalta 1991 (cf. the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n As we saw, Taylor (1985) has no modal theory of facts, but it seems\nthat in a natural modal extension of his theory, P1 should hold.\nNotice that P1 is immediate on the view that facts are sets of worlds,\nand that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts (the view put forward\nin Restall 2004). For then, \\(\\ES(x) = x\\) for any fact \\(x\\).\n\nP1 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\).\nConsider the following assumptions \\((H_0\\) is a selected independent\nset which generates \\(F\\) via Booleanization):\n\nAll propositions are Boolean compounds of propositions taken from\na special set, the set of atomic propositions;\nTo each atomic proposition \\(p\\) corresponds a fact \\(x\\) in\n\\(H_0\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) may be willing to accept them, and doing\nso he will thereby endorse P1.\n\nThere is a simpler argument against P1 enemies of disjunctive facts\nmay advance. Take any two propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and assume they\nhave a disjunction \\(r\\) (we may assume that \\(p\\) can be true and\n\\(q\\) false, and vice versa). By P1, there are facts \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\) and \\(\\ES(y) = \\TS(q)\\) and\n\\(\\ES(z) = \\TS(r)\\). So \\(\\ES(z) = \\ES(x) \\cup \\ES(y)\\), and \\(z\\)\nbehaves like a disjunctive fact: it exists in a world iff \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) does.\n\nThose who take these to be problems may endorse the following weaker\nprinciple: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can be true and every\nworld \\(w\\) at which it is true, there is a fact which makes it true.\nThat principle is equivalent to: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can\nbe true, there exists a set of facts \\(G\\) whose members are\nrepresented by \\(p\\) such that every member of \\(G\\) necessitates\n\\(p\\). To put it differently, for every proposition which can be true,\nthere is set of facts whose disjunctive existence-set is identical to\nthe proposition\u2019s truth-set:\n\nP2. \\(\\forall p\\in\nP^{\\circ} \\exists G\\subseteq F \\, \\DES(G) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nThis principle is endorsed by Armstrong (1997), and seems to be taken\nby Fine as fitting his theory C-Cond (Fine 1982; cf. the supplementary\ndocument\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n\nBut there are still potential problems, this time related to\nconjunction.\n\nFor take the conjunctive proposition that Socrates is a philosopher\nand Frege is human. P2 tells us that there is a set of facts \\(K\\)\nsuch that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is\nthat set of facts? One may be tempted to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human.\nIt is hard to see which other answer could be provided, and so P2\nseems to commit one to conjunctive facts.\n\nThose who are bothered by these features of P1 and P2 may wish to\nadopt the following principle: there is a special set of propositions\n\\(Q\\) such that (i) the restriction of P1 to \\(Q\\) holds, i.e., for\nevery \\(p\\) in \\(Q\\), there is a fact \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) =\n\\TS(p)\\), and (ii) for every world \\(w\\) where a proposition \\(p\\) is\ntrue, there is a part \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) whose members are true, and such\nthat in every world where they are true, \\(p\\) is true.\n\nBut there are still potential problems, which actually affect P2 as\nwell, this time related to negation. Take the negative proposition\nthat Socrates is not a philosopher. By P2, there is a set of facts\n\\(K\\) such that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What\nis that set of facts? One may wish to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is not a philosopher. Again, it is\nhard to think of any alternative, and so P2 seems to commit one to\nnegative facts. Alternatively, assume the previous principle. Shall we\ntake the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher to be in \\(Q\\)\nor not? If we do, then we are in the same situation as before: we seem\nto be committed to negative facts. If we do not, it is hard to see\nwhich set of propositions \\(R \\subseteq Q\\) satisfying condition (ii)\nabove we are going to choose.\n\nIn order to deal with negative propositions, Armstrong (1997) invokes\na certain kind of facts which he calls \u2018totality facts\u2019,\nfacts which can be designated by means of expressions of type\n\u2018the fact that \\(X\\) are all the \\(F\\)s that there are\u2019,\nwhere \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 is a rigid plural designator and\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 a predicate. The proposition that Socrates is not\na philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the atomic\nfacts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there are\u2014a\ntotality fact.\n\nThose who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative\nand totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker\nthan P2):\n\nP3. \\[\\begin{align*}\\forall p\\in P^{\\circ} \\exists G\\subseteq P(F)\\times P(F) \\cup_{\\langle G,H\\rangle \\in G} (\\CES(G) \\cap(W \\setsub \\DES(H)))\\\\ = \\TS(p).\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nP3 says that the following is true of every proposition \\(p\\) which\ncan be true: for every world where \\(p\\) is true, there are two sets\nof facts \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) such that (i) in \\(w\\), all members of \\(G\\)\nexist and none of \\(H\\) do, and (ii) in every world where this is the\ncase, \\(p\\) is true. That principle is rather ugly, but it does what\nit should do.\n\nP3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\).\nConsider the following assumptions:\n\nAll propositions are Boolean compounds of propositions taken from\na special set, the set of atomic propositions;\nTo each atomic proposition \\(p\\) corresponds a fact \\(x\\) in \\(F\\)\nsuch that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) may be willing to accept\nthem\u2014Wittgenstein (TLP) does\u2014and if he does, he\nwill thereby accept P3.\n\nEven the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true\nuniversal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my\nright hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some\ncontroversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein\u2019s view\nthat universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3\ninvolves accepting that there is something like the fact that every\nfinger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its\nexistence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in\nquestion. Following Wittgenstein (TLP), many reject such\nuniversal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (PLA)\nand Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which\nhave indeed a universal component.).\n\nThere is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous\ndifficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic\npropositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex\npropositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular\ncontent of these propositions. This is the view put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP: the atomic facts make true the true atomic\npropositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean\ncombination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what\nhappens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive,\nsince they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they\nprove especially difficult to develop, especially when special\npropositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving\nmodal concepts.\n2.5 The Inner Structure of Facts\n\nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n singular propositions\n and\n structured propositions.)\n\nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction\u2014and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as parts.\n\nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\nsubstantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation \\(R\\) (in that order) by \u2018[\\(R\\); \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\)]\u2019. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n\u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019 corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls \u2018objectualism\u2019 (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP\n(\u2018perhaps\u2019, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him).\n\nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations.\n\nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts:\n\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world (i) the\nobjects have that property and (ii) the objects and the property\nexist;\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world the objects\nhave that property.\n\n\nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.)\n\nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one\u2019s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world.\n\nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation.\n\nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation \\(x\\). Then as we saw,\nit would be odd to claim that \\(x\\) is not a complex fact, having\nSocrates as a component. Suppose \\(x\\) has such a complexity. Now take\ntwo worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\), such that in \\(w\\) Socrates exists but is\nnot a philosopher, and in \\(v\\), Socrates does not exist (and so is\nnot a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that\nSocrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of\nview (a), \\(x\\) exists in \\(w\\) but not in \\(v\\). The outcome is\nrather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of\nconjunction.\n\nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on.\n\nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal\nCriterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.",
