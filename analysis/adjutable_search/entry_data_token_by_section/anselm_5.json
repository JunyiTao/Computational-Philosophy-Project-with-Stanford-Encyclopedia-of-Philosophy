    "main_text": "The Divine Nature || The consistency of the divine attributes\n3.2 The consistency of the divine attributes\n\nAnselm\u2019s success in generating a whole host of divine attributes\nthrough the ontological argument does present him with a\nproblem.  He must show that the attributes are consistent with\neach other \u2013 in other words, that it is possible for one and the\nsame being to have all of them. For example, there seems at first\nglance to be a conflict between justice and omnipotence. If God is\nperfectly just, he cannot lie. But if God is omnipotent, how can there\nbe something he cannot do? Anselm\u2019s solution is to explain that\nomnipotence does not mean the ability to do everything; instead, it\nmeans the possession of unlimited power. Now the so-called\n\u201cability\u201d or \u201cpower\u201d to lie is not really a\npower at all; it is a kind of weakness. Being omnipotent, God has no\nweakness. So it turns out that omnipotence actually entails\nthe inability to lie.\n\nAnother apparent contradiction is between God\u2019s mercy and his\njustice. If God is just, he will surely punish the wicked as they\ndeserve. But because he is merciful, he spares the wicked. Anselm\ntries to resolve this apparent contradiction by appeal to God\u2019s\ngoodness. It is better, he says, for God \u201cto be good both to the\ngood and to the wicked than to be good only to the good, and it is\nbetter to be good to the wicked both in punishing and in sparing them\nthan to be good only in punishing them\u201d (P 9). So\nGod\u2019s supreme goodness requires that he be both just and\nmerciful. But Anselm is not content to resolve the apparent tension\nbetween justice and mercy by appealing to some other attribute,\ngoodness, that entails both justice and mercy; he goes on to argue\nthat justice itself requires mercy. Justice to sinners obviously\nrequires that God punish them; but God\u2019s justice to\nhimself requires that he exercise his supreme goodness in sparing\nthe wicked. \u201cThus,\u201d Anselm says to God, \u201cin saving\nus whom you might justly destroy \u2026 you are just, not because\nyou give us our due, but because you do what is fitting for you who\nare supremely good\u201d (P 10). In spite of these\narguments, Anselm acknowledges that there is a residue of mystery\nhere:\n\nThus your mercy is born of your justice, since it is just for you to\nbe so good that you are good even in sparing the wicked. And perhaps\nthis is why the one who is supremely just can will good things for the\nwicked. But even if one can somehow grasp why you can will to save the\nwicked, certainly no reasoning can comprehend why, from those who are\nalike in wickedness, you save some rather than others through your\nsupreme goodness and condemn some rather than others through your\nsupreme justice. (P 11)\n\n\nIn other words, the philosopher can trace the conceptual relations\namong goodness, justice, and mercy, and show that God not only can but\nmust have all three; but no human reasoning can hope to show why God\ndisplays his justice and mercy in precisely the ways in which he does.\n(For a detailed and sympathetic reconstruction of Anselm\u2019s\narguments concerning justice and mercy, see Mann 2019.)\n",
