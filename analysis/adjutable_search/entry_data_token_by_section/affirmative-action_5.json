    "main_text": "Equality\u2019s Rule\n6. Equality\u2019s Rule\n\n\nThis was a conclusion Justice Brennan tried vigorously to forestall.\nBrennan agreed with Powell that \u201cequal protection\u201d must\nmean the same thing\u2014that is, remain one rule\u2014whether\napplied to blacks or whites. But the same rule applied to different\ncircumstances need not yield the same results. Racial preferences\ncreated for different reasons and producing different outcomes need not\nall be judged in the same harsh, virtually fatal, manner. This point\nwas the crux of Brennan\u2019s defense of the Medical School\u2019s policy.\n\n\nPowell thought there was no principled way to distinguish\n\u201cbenign\u201d from \u201cmalign\u201d discrimination, but\nBrennan insisted there was. He argued that if the Court looked\ncarefully at its past cases striking down Jim Crow laws, it would see\nthe principle at work. What the Court found wrong in Jim Crow was that\nit served no purpose except to mark out and stigmatize one group of\npeople as inferior. The \u201ccardinal principle\u201d operating in\nthe Court\u2019s decisions condemned racial classifications \u201cdrawn on\nthe presumption that one race is inferior to another\u201d or that\n\u201cput the weight of government behind racial hatred and\n separation\u201d (Bakke, at 358 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n Brennan agreed with Powell that no public\nracial classification motivated by racial animus, no classification\nwhose purpose is to stigmatize people with the \u201cbadge of\ninferiority,\u201d could withstand judicial scrutiny. However, the\nMedical School\u2019s policy, even if ill-advised or mistaken, reflected a\npublic purpose far different from that found in Jim Crow. The policy\nought not be treated as though it were cut from the same cloth.\n\n\nBrennan granted that if a state adopted a racial classification for\nthe purpose of humiliating whites, or stigmatizing Allan Bakke as\ninferior and confining him to second-class citizenship, that\nclassification would be as odious as Jim Crow. But the Medical School\u2019s\npolicy had neither this purpose nor this effect. Allan Bakke may have\nbeen upset and resentful at losing out under the special plan, but he\nwasn\u2019t \u201cin any sense stamped as an inferior by the Medical\nSchool\u2019s rejection of him.\u201d Nor did his loss constitute a\n\u201cpervasive injury,\u201d in the sense that wherever he went he\nwould be treated as a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d because of his\n color (Bakke, at 376 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n\n\nIn short, argued Brennan, the principle expressed in the Equal\nProtection Clause should be viewed as an anti-caste principle,\na principle that uniformly and consistently rejects all public\nlaw whose purpose is to subject people to an inferior and degraded\nstation in life, whether they are black or \n white.[15]\n Of course, given\nthe asymmetrical position of whites and blacks in our country, we are\nnot likely to encounter laws that try to stigmatize whites as an\ninferior caste (much less succeed at it). But this merely shows that a\nprinciple applied to different circumstances produces different\nresults. Because the Medical School\u2019s program sought to undo the\neffects of a racial caste system long-enduring in America, it\nrepresented a purpose of great social importance and should not be\nfound Constitutionally infirm: so maintained\n Brennan (Bakke, at 363 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n\n\nJustice Powell never successfully engaged this way of reading\n\u201cconstitutional equality.\u201d His insistence on clear, plain,\nunitary, absolute principle did not cut against the Brennan view. The\nissue between Powell and Brennan was not the consistency and stringency\nof the principle but its content. If the Constitution says, \u201cThe\nstate cannot deliberately burden someone by race if its purpose is\nto create or maintain caste,\u201d then constitutional law\ndoesn\u2019t block any of the Medical School\u2019s\n justifications.[16]\n\n\nIf we turn away from exegesis of the Constitution, are we likely to\nfind in political theory itself any principle of equality implying that\nevery use of racial preferences in every circumstance\nworks an intolerable injustice? \n\nThe prospects seem dim. Won\u2019t very general notions of equality\nlend themselves to defending affirmative action (and the social\ninclusion it effects) as well as condemning it (and the racial\nnon\u2013neutrality it\n involves)?[17] \nThe challenge here is well-illustrated by\nCarl Cohen\u2019s most recent effort, in a debate with James Sterba,\nto extract a strict prohibition on racial preferences from the\nAristotelian principle that \u201cequals should be treated\nequally\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 23).  This principle, urges\nCohen, \u201ccertainly entails at least this: It is wrong, always and\neverywhere, to give special advantage to any group simply on the basis\nof physical characteristics that have no relevance to the award given\nor the burden imposed\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 25).  Whether\nanything interesting follows from this proposition depends on how we\nconstrue \u201crelevance.\u201d Cohen admits that public policy may\nrightly treat some people differently because of their physical\ncharacteristics. For example, the state might offer special assistance\nto the old or disabled. Now, this example suggests that the relevance\nof physical differences is something independent of social policy. Age\nand disability, it seems, are real features of persons and public\npolicy simply tracks them. However, the difference that differences\nmake is not something itself given by nature; it is determined by\npublic purposes. Age and disability are made relevant in this\nmanner\u2014in the one case, by the social purpose of assuring that\npeople do not have to live in poverty when they can no longer work; in\nthe other case, by the social purpose of assuring that people are not\nforeclosed from developing and marketing their talents by impediments\nin the (largely constructed) physical environment. \n\n\nPurpose determines relevancy, and this is true whether or not the\nrelevant differences are physical. If the nation thinks it desirable to change white\ninstitutions so that they are less uniformly white, that purpose links\nskin color to recruitment.\n\n\nBecause the Aristotelian principle by itself doesn\u2019t rule out\nracial preferences (since blacks and whites may be relevantly\ndifferent with respect to certain legitimate public purposes), it is\nnot surprising that Cohen also invokes a substantive conception of\nequality: \u201cAll members of humankind are equally ends in themselves,\nall have equal dignity\u2014and therefore all are entitled to equal\nrespect from the community and its laws\u201d (Cohen and Sterba 2003,\n24). This principle, however, brings us back to the interpretive\nquestions about \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d played out in the\nPowell-Brennan exchange in Bakke. By Justice Brennan\u2019s lights,\nAllen Bakke\u2019s basic dignity was not violated. The Medical\nSchool\u2019s two-track policy that resulted in Bakke\u2019s\nrejection did not, by intent or effect, stigmatize him as inferior, or\nmark him off as a member of a despised caste, or turn him into a\nsecond-class citizen. Bakke arguably had to bear a particular burden\nbecause of his race but the burden was not significantly different\nobjectively from others that public policy might have thrown his\nway. If the Medical School had reserved sixteen of its seats for\napplicants from economically deprived backgrounds, no one would have\nsuggested that it had violated the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Yet under this hypothetical policy Allan Bakke\ncould have lost out as well\u2014lost out to low-income applicants\nwhose college grades and MCAT scores were inferior to his own. Allen\nBakke may have felt aggrieved at losing out under the Medical\nSchool\u2019s policy of racial preferences, but it is not enough to\nshow that those who lose out under some public scheme feel offended or\ndisgruntled. Cohen needs to specify a conception of dignity in which\nbearing unequal burdens on behalf of urgent social ends invariably\namounts to an assault on dignity if the burdens happen to be assigned\nby race. This specification remains unfinished in his work so far.\n\n",
