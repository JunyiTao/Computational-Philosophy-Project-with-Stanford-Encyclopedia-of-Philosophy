    "main_text": "The Three Means of Persuasion || Persuasion Through the Argument Itself\n5.3 Persuasion Through the Argument Itself\n\nWith regard to the subject the speech is about, persuasion comes about\nthrough arguments, i.e. by proving (or seemingly proving) that\nsomething is the case. Most probably, this is meant to take up the\nidea mentioned above, i.e. that people are most or most easily\npersuaded, when they suppose something to have been proven\n(Rhet. I.1, 1355a3f.). This third means of persuasion\n(pistis) is distinguished from the other two means of\npersuasion through being the only probative (apodeiktikos)\ndevice of persuasion; due to its argument-like structure, involving\npremises and a conclusion, it can directly argue for the point of view\nthat the speaker wishes to establish. It does so by inferentially\nconnecting the suggested conclusion with facts that are evident or\nwith convictions already held by the audience. Probative persuasion is\nessential, since, at the end of the day, each speech necessarily\ninvolves a claim (i.e. the point of view the speaker suggests) plus\nthe proofs that are given in support of this claim (Rhet.\nIII.13, 1414a30\u201336). For Aristotle, there are two species of\narguments: inductions and deductions (Posterior Analytics\nI.1, 71a5ff.). Induction (epag\u00f4g\u00ea) is defined as\nthe proceeding from particulars up to a universal (Topics\nI.12, 105a13ff.). A deduction (sullogismos) is an argument in\nwhich, certain things having been supposed, something different from\nthe suppositions results of necessity through them (Topics\nI.1, 100a25ff.) or because of their being true (Prior\nAnalytics I.2, 24b18\u201320). The inductive argument in\nrhetoric is the example (paradeigma); unlike other inductive\narguments, it does not proceed from many particular cases to one\nuniversal case, but from one particular to a similar particular if\nboth particulars fall under the same genus (Rhet. I.2,\n1357b25ff.). The deductive argument in rhetoric is the enthymeme (see\nbelow\n \u00a7 6).\n Indeed, most of Rhet. I & II is dedicated to the\ntreatment of this third probative means of persuasion: After the\nsecond part of the long chapter Rhet. I.2 has introduced\nbasic distinctions within the probative mode of persuasion, chapters\nRhet. I.4\u201315 unfold argumentative devices that are\nspecific to the three genres of speech, while chapters Rhet.\nII.4\u201326 discuss generally applicable aspects of proofs or\narguments (see above\n \u00a7 2).\n\nAristotle repeatedly says that these rhetorical arguments persuade\npeople either by proving or by (merely) seeming to prove\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a3\u20134 and I.2, 1356a19\u201320);\naccordingly, he lists topoi for real (Rhet. II.23)\nand merely apparent enthymemes (Rhet. II.24) (see below\n \u00a7 7).\n Obviously, Aristotle refers here to fallacious or deceptive\narguments, for these arguments have a similar persuasive effect, if\nthe fallacy or deception goes unnoticed by the audience (for people\nwill think, i.e. take it to be the case, that something has\nbeen proven). One might wonder whether the inclusion of only seemingly\nprobative arguments is compatible with Aristotle\u2019s general\ntendency to base rhetorical persuasion on (real) proofs. However, the\ntreatment of fallacious rhetorical arguments is strictly parallel to\nwhat happens in the case of dialectic. For dialectic too, includes a\npart dealing with sound or valid arguments (namely in Topics\nII\u2013VII) and a part that analyses fallacious arguments (namely in\nthe Sophistical Refutations). It is part of the\nrhetorician\u2019s competence also to know about fallacious\narguments, if only in order to detect them, when they are used by\nopponents.\n",
