    "main_text": "Rational Egoism\n3. Rational Egoism\n\nRational egoism claims that I ought to perform some action if and only\nif, and because, performing that action maximizes my self-interest.\n(As with ethical egoism, there are variants which drop maximization or\nevaluate rules or character traits rather than actions. There are also\nvariants which make the maximization of self-interest necessary but\nnot sufficient, or sufficient but not necessary, for an action to be\nthe action I ought to perform. Again, I set these issues aside.)\nRational egoism makes claims about what I ought, or have reason, to\ndo, without restricting the \u201cought\u201d or\n\u201creason\u201d to a moral \u201cought\u201d or\n\u201creason.\u201d \n\nLike ethical egoism, rational egoism needs arguments to support it.\nOne might cite our most confident judgments about rational action and\nclaim that rational egoism best fits these. The problem is that our\nmost confident judgments about rational action seem to be captured by\na different, extremely popular theory \u2014 the instrumental theory\nof rationality. According to the instrumental theory, I ought to\nperform some action if and only if, and because, performing that\naction maximizes the satisfaction of my preferences. Since\npsychological egoism seems false, it may be rational for me to make an\nuncompensated sacrifice for the sake of others, for this may be what,\non balance, best satisfies my (strong, non-self-interested)\npreferences. This conflict with the instrumental theory is a major\nproblem for rational egoism.\n\nThe rational egoist might reply that the instrumental theory is\nequally a problem for any standard moral theory that claims to give an\naccount of what one ought rationally, or all things considered, to do.\nIf, for example, a utilitarian claims that I have most reason to give\nto charity, since that maximizes the general happiness, I could object\nthat giving to charity cannot be rational given my particular\npreferences, which are for things other than the general\nhappiness.\n\nA different problem for rational egoism is that it appears arbitrary.\nSuppose I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of blue-eyed\npeople, but not of other people. Unless I can explain why blue-eyed\npeople are to be preferred, my claim looks arbitrary, in the sense\nthat I have given no reason for the different treatments. As a\nrational egoist, I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of one\nperson (myself). Unless I can explain why I should be preferred, my\nclaim looks equally arbitrary.\n\nOne reply is to argue that non-arbitrary distinctions can be made by\none\u2019s preferences. Say I like anchovies and hate broccoli. This\nmakes my decision to buy anchovies rather than broccoli non-arbitrary.\nSimilarly, my preference for my own welfare makes my concentration on\nmy own welfare non-arbitrary.\n\nThere are two problems for this reply.\n\nFirst, we do not always take preferences to establish non-arbitrary\ndistinctions. If I defend favoring blue-eyed people simply by noting\nthat I like blue-eyed people, without any justification for my liking,\nthis seems unsatisfactory. The rational egoist must argue that hers is\na case where preferences are decisive.\n\nSecond, if psychological egoism is false, I might lack a preference\nfor my own welfare. It would follow that for me, a distinction between\nmy welfare and that of others would be arbitrary, and the rational\negoist claim that each ought to maximize his own welfare would be\nunjustified when applied to me. The proposal that preferences\nestablish non-arbitrary distinctions supports the instrumental theory\nbetter than rational egoism.\n\nAnother reply to the arbitrariness worry is to claim that certain\ndistinctions just are non-arbitrary. Which distinctions these are is\nrevealed by looking at whether we ask for justifications of the\nrelevance of the distinction. In the case of my maximizing of the\nwelfare of the blue-eyed, we do ask for a justification; we do not\ntake \u201cbecause they\u2019re blue-eyed\u201d as an adequate\ndefense of a reason to give to the blue-eyed. In the case of my\nmaximizing my own welfare, however, \u201cbecause it will make me\nbetter off\u201d may seem a reasonable justification; we do not\nquickly ask \u201cwhy does that matter?\u201d\n\nIn a much-quoted passage, Sidgwick claimed that rational egoism is not\narbitrary: \u201cIt would be contrary to Common Sense to deny that\nthe distinction between any one individual and any other is real and\nfundamental, and that consequently \u2018I\u2019 am concerned with\nthe quality of my existence as an individual in a sense, fundamentally\nimportant, in which I am not concerned with the quality of the\nexistence of other individuals: and this being so, I do not see how it\ncan be proved that this distinction is not to be taken as fundamental\nin determining the ultimate end of rational action for an\nindividual\u201d (Sidgwick 1907, 498). This can be interpreted in\nvarious ways (Shaver 1999, 82\u201398; Shaver 2020; Phillips 2011,\nch. 5).\n\nOn the most natural interpretation, Sidgwick is noting various\nnon-normative facts. I have a distinct history, memories, and perhaps\nspecial access to my mental contents. But it is not clear how these\nfacts support the normative conclusion Sidgwick draws. Utilitarians,\nfor example, agree about these facts. (Some of the facts may also not\ngive the sharp distinction Sidgwick wants. I may usually know more\nabout my pain than yours, but this difference seems a matter of\ndegree.)\n\nSidgwick might instead be claiming that attacks on rational egoism\nfrom certain views of personal identity fail because they rest on a\nfalse view of personal identity. He might have in mind Humean views\n(as in Parfit, discussed below). Perhaps more likely, he might have in\nmind Schopenhauer\u2019s view \u2014 which Schopenhauer deploys\nagainst egoism \u2014 that there is a \u201creal identity of any one\nego with all others\u201d (Sidgwick 1896: 281; Schopenhauer 1965:\n204\u20137). (Schopenhauer thinks this follows from Kant\u2019s view\nthat space and time belong only to appearances.) But this would only\ndefend a presupposition of rational egoism \u2014 that there are\nseparate individuals. It would not follow that the distinction between\nthem matters.\n\nFinally, Sidgwick might be claiming that my point of view, like an\nimpartial point of view, is non-arbitrary. But there are other points\nof view, such as that of my species, family or country. Sidgwick finds\nthem arbitrary. It is hard to see why my point of view, and an\nimpartial point of view, are non-arbitrary, while anything in between\nis arbitrary. For example, in favour of my point of view, Sidgwick\ncould note that I am an individual rather than a hive-member.\nBut I am a member of various groups as well. And if my being an\nindividual is important, this cuts against the importance of taking up\nan impartial point of view just as it cuts against the importance of\ntaking up the point of view of various groups. Similarly, if the\nimpartial point of view is defended as non-arbitrary because it makes\nno distinctions, both the point of view of various groups and my\nindividual point of view are suspect.\n\nDebate over rational egoism was revitalized by Parfit 1984 pts.\nII-III. Parfit gives two main arguments against rational egoism. Both\nfocus on the rational egoist\u2019s attitude toward the future: the\nrational egoist holds that the time at which some good comes is by\nitself irrelevant, so that, for example, I ought to sacrifice a small\npresent gain for a larger future gain.\n\nFirst, one could challenge rational egoism, not only with the\ninstrumental theory, but also with the \u201cpresent-aim\u201d\ntheory of rationality. According to the present-aim theory, I have\nmost reason to do what maximizes the satisfaction of my present\ndesires. Even if all of these desires are self-regarding, the\npresent-aim theory need not coincide with rational egoism. Suppose I\nknow that in the future I will desire a good pension, but I do not now\ndesire a good pension for myself in the future; I have different\nself-regarding desires. Suppose also that, looking back from the end\nof my life, I will have maximized my welfare by contributing now to\nthe pension. Rational egoism requires that I contribute now. The\npresent-aim theory does not. It claims that my reasons are relative\nnot only to who has a desire \u2014 me rather than someone else\n\u2014 but also to when the desire is held \u2014 now rather than in\nthe past or future. The obvious justification an egoist could offer\nfor not caring about time \u2014 that one should care only about the\namount of good produced \u2014 is suicidal, since that should\nlead one not to care about who receives the good. One reason the\npresent-aim theory is important is that it shows there is a coherent,\nmore minimal alternative to rational egoism. The rational egoist\ncannot argue that egoism is the most minimal theory, and that standard\nmoral theories, by requiring more of people, require special,\nadditional justification. (For a very different argument to show again\nthat an alternative to morality is less minimal than expected \u2014\ndirected more at the instrumental theory than rational egoism \u2014\nsee Korsgaard 2005.)\n\nSecond, rational egoism might be challenged by some views of personal\nidentity. Say half of my brain will be transplanted to another body\nA. My old body will be destroyed. A will have my\nmemories, traits, and goals. It seems reasonable for me to care\nspecially about A, and indeed to say that A is\nidentical to me. Now say half of my brain will go in B and\nhalf in C. Again B and C will have my\nmemories, traits, and goals. It seems reasonable for me to care\nspecially about B and C. But B and\nC cannot be identical to me, since they are not identical to\none another (they go on to live different lives). So the ground of my\ncare is not identity, but rather the psychological connections through\nmemories, etc. Even in the case of A, what grounds my care\nare these connections, not identity: my relation to A is the\nsame as my relation to B (or C), so what grounds my\ncare about A grounds my care about B (or C)\n\u2014 and that cannot be identity. (To make the point in a different\nway \u2014 I would not take steps to ensure that only one of\nB and C come about.) If so, I need not care\nspecially about some of my future selves, since they will not have\nthese connections to me. And I do have reason to care specially about\nother people who bear these connections to me now.\n\nOne worry is that psychological continuity might substitute for\nidentity. Say F1 and F2 are\npsychologically connected because (for example)\nF2 has a memory of F1\u2019s\nexperiences. Suppose that F3 has a memory of\nF2\u2019s experiences but no memory of\nF1. F1 and\nF3 are psychologically continuous, though\nnot psychologically connected. (Parfit\u2019s view is that\npsychological connection and continuity both ground special care, if\nspecial care is grounded at all.) In the cases above, A,\nB and C are continuous with me. An egoist might\nclaim that continuity alone matters for special care; that fits the\ncases. If so, I do have reason to care specially about all of the\nfuture selves I am continuous with, and do not have this reason to\ncare specially about others with whom I am not continuous. (For this\nand other worries about Parfit, see Brink 1992, Johnston 1997, Hills\n2010 111\u2013116.)\n\nParfit could reply that continuity might not suffice for special care.\nIt is not clear that F1 has reason to care\nspecially about F3 \u2014 F3\nmight seem a stranger, perhaps even an unlikeable one. When young,\nsome worry about becoming someone they would not now like. They see no\nreason for special care for this future person. This worry makes\nsense, but if continuity were sufficient for special care, it would\nnot. If so, perhaps both continuity and connection, or perhaps\ncontinuity and admirability, are needed. This would let Parfit keep\nthe conclusion that I need not care specially for some of my future\nselves, but would not justify the conclusion that I have reason to\ncare specially about other people who are merely connected to me now\n(or are merely admirable).\n\nA worry is that some do care specially about merely continuous future\nselves. With opposed intuitions about when special care is due, the\ntactic of arguing from intuitions about special care to the grounds of\nthis care is indecisive.\n\nThere is a much simpler argument. Prichard argued that self-interest\ndoes not give a reason. This might be convincing if\n\u201creason\u201d means \u201cmoral reason.\u201d It is not\nconvincing against a rational egoist, whose reasons are\n\u201cflavourless\u201d (see previous section). But Prichard\u2019s\nargument might be improved. Suppose, unlike Prichard, we admit reasons\nthat are not specifically moral (or think there are moral reasons to\nbenefit oneself). The egoist still holds a counter-intuitive position.\nAs A. C. Ewing notes, the egoist thinks there is only one sort of\nreason. The egoist denies, for example, that, by itself, the fact that\nthe child will otherwise drown gives me any reason to save her. The\negoist denies that, by itself, the fact that I have made a promise\ngives me any reason to keep it. Even if I have reason to do what\npromotes my self-interest, most think I have other reasons as well.\nThe egoist needs to explain why this is not so (Ewing 1965: 28; Shaver\n2022).\n\nOne might object to Prichard-style arguments that (a) they are\nquestion-begging, since egoists will hardly agree that my reason for\nhelping is something other than the benefit to me, and (b) given\ndisagreement over this claim about my reason, the appropriate response\nis to suspend judgment about it. Alison Hills, in 2010 parts II and\nIII, replies to (a) that moralists can assure themselves by giving\narguments that start from premises like [H] \u201cI have a reason to\nhelp regardless of whether doing so contributes to my\nself-interest,\u201d provided [H] is not inferred from the falsity of\nrational egoism \u2014 perhaps it is self-evident (see also Rachels\n1974). In reply to (b), she argues that disagreement over [H] does not\nrequire moralists to suspend judgment about it, although disagreement\nover an egoistic premiss like \u201cI have reason to help only\nbecause doing so benefits me\u201d does require egoists to suspend\njudgment. The difference, she argues, is that rational egoists (like\nothers making non-moral claims) aim at knowledge, and for putative\nknowledge, in cases of disagreement between epistemic peers,\nsuspension of belief is required. If we disagree, and both of us know\nthat one of us is no more likely to be right than the other, we should\neach suspend belief. Moralists, Hills argues, have a different aim:\nthey aim primarily not at knowledge but at the ability to draw, on\ntheir own, true moral conclusions from the evidence. She takes this to\nbe supported by the thought that moral worth requires this ability.\nSince aiming at this ability requires not giving weight to the\nconclusions of others, suspension of belief in cases of disagreement\nis not required of moralists.\n\nObviously, much here depends on the claim about the aim of moralists.\nOne might object that moralists care much more about getting true\nmoral conclusions than about arriving at them on their own. If I could\nguarantee that I do the right act by relying on a Moral Answers\nMachine (and not otherwise), I ought to do so. In addition, since\nmoralists do want true moral conclusions, and peer disagreement is\nrelevant to pursuing truth (see the entry on\n disagreement),\n Hills\u2019 moralists both need and cannot (by one means) pursue\ntruth.\n\nThere is another recent argument against rational egoism (Rachels and\nAlter 2005, Tersman 2008, and especially de Lazari-Radek and Singer\n2014). (1) Believing that rational egoism is true increases my\nreproductive fitness, whether or not rational egoism is true. (2)\nTherefore my belief that rational egoism is true (or, better, that\nrational egoism appears to me true upon reflection) does not help to\njustify rational egoism, since I would have that belief whether or not\nrational egoism is true. (3) For some other normative beliefs (such as\nbelief in utilitarianism), having the belief does not increase\nreproductive fitness. (4) Therefore my belief that (say)\nutilitarianism is true can help justify utilitarianism. (Without (3)\nand (4), there is no argument against rational egoism in\nparticular.)\n\nHere I put aside general objections to evolutionary debunking\narguments (see, for example, Shafer-Landau 2012 or Schafer 2010). I\nalso put aside the possibility of debunking arguments that would\ntarget the impartiality of utilitarianism (Andes 2019).\n\nOne worry is that what best increases reproductive fitness is acting\nas a kin altruist rather than as a rational egoist (Crisp 2012, Other\nInternet Resources). Presumably, then, it is believing that I ought to\nact as a kin altruist, rather than as a rational egoist, that best\nincreases my reproductive fitness. (If there is a tie between what\nincreases reproductive fitness and belief, and believing that rational\negoism is true is best for reproductive fitness, one would expect many\nto believe that rational egoism is true. But very few do, while many\nendorse Broad\u2019s \u201cself-referential altruism\u201d (Broad\n1971b).) De Lazari-Radek and Singer reply that the recommendations of\nrational egoism are very close to those of kin altruism, and much\ncloser to those of kin altruism than are the recommendations of\nutilitarianism (2014 194). But rational egoism and kin altruism do\nmake opposed recommendations. For example, kin altruism might\nrecommend that I sacrifice myself for my family, whether I care about\nthem or not, whereas rational egoism would recommend sacrifice only if\nmy welfare were to be higher were I to sacrifice and die rather than\nnot sacrifice and live. It is also hard to think of a plausible\nargument which has kin altruism as a premiss and rational egoism as\nthe conclusion, so doubts about kin altruism do not seem to undercut\narguments for rational egoism. Nor is it clear how noting a difference\nin the closeness of recommendations justifies concluding that rational\negoism is debunked and utilitarianism not debunked.\n\nAnother worry is that if my belief that I have reason to care about my\nown well-being is unjustified, an argument that starts with that\nreason as a premiss, and then adds that the focus on my own well-being\nis arbitrary and so should be broadened to include everyone, is\nundercut. One might reply (with de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014 191)\nthat there are other ways of arriving at the conclusion that I have\nreason to care about the well-being of everyone. Perhaps something\nlike utilitarianism is justified as self-evident rather than inferred\nfrom some other reasons. The evolutionary argument targets conclusions\nthat can be reached only by appeal to a belief whose support\ncan be undercut by noting that we would have the belief whether or not\nit is true. It is then open to the rational egoist to say that there\nis some other way of arriving at rational egoism. Perhaps this is\nunpromising, since the obvious way to justify rational egoism, as\nself-evident, is to be undercut by (1) and (2). However, (i) if\nbelieving that one ought to act as a kin altruist rather than as a\nrational egoist is what best increases reproductive fitness, rational\negoism is, like utilitarianism, not undercut by (1) and (2). (ii) A\ncomponent of utilitarianism (and any plausible theory), the belief\nthat pain is bad, seems to be a belief that best increases\nreproductive fitness whether or not it is true (see Kahane 2011 and\n2014; for some replies, see Bramble 2017 and Jaquet 2018). Even if\nnothing is good or bad, believing that pain is bad might increase my\nmotivation to avoid pain and so lead me to survive longer.\n\nA further worry is that it is not clear that having the belief\nbest increases reproductive fitness. De Lazari-Radek and Singer argue,\nin reply to the objection that their argument takes away the\njustification for believing that pain is bad, that there is no\nadvantage to believing that pain is bad; I am sufficiently motivated\nto avoid pain without any such belief (de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014\n268\u2013269; for the general point, see Parfit 2011 v. 2\n527\u201330). The same seems to go for rational egoism: I am\nsufficiently motivated to act egoistically without any belief in the\ntruth of rational egoism.\n",
