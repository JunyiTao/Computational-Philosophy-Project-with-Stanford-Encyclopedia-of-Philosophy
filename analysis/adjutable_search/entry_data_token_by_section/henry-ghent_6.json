    "main_text": "Creatural Essences and Divine Ideas\n7. Creatural Essences and Divine Ideas\n\n\nYet how are essences constituted in their being? As mentioned above,\nessences depend on the divine intellect, which is their exemplary\ncause. More precisely, essences correspond to divine ideas, which\nrepresent their eternal exemplars. This might seem to be the habitual\nscheme of Christian Platonism, though scholars (especially de Rijk\n1991) have pointed out that, beginning with Henry, the term\n\u201cidea\u201d loses its traditional meaning of \u201csubsisting\nform\u201d and moves closer to its meaning in Descartes and Locke of\n\u201cinstrument\u201d or \u201cterm\u201d of knowledge. According\nto Henry an idea is in God for the fact that divine essence is in some\nways imitable by creatural essences. God's knowledge of what is\ndifferent from Himself coincides with the knowledge of the different\nways in which He considers Himself imitable, since divine knowledge is\nnot determined by the presence of external objects, but rather is\nitself the formal (exemplary) cause of its own contents. Here, however,\nthe classic question of the relation between divine simplicity and\ncreatural multiplicity again arises. Were God to know immediately the\nplurality of creatable objects (essences), His simplicity and unity\n(divine knowledge is not really distinct from divine essence) would be\nirremediably compromised.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if God did not have access to the multiplicity of\nall that is distinct from His essence, He would not know anything. So,\naccording to Henry, divine knowledge has a primary object, which is\ndivine essence itself, absolutely simple and indivisible, and a\nsecondary object, which is in some way \u201cother\u201d than divine\nknowledge. To avoid any excessively brusque passage, the knowledge of\nthis secondary object is then subdivided into two distinct moments: in\nthe first, every creatural essence is coincident with divine essence\nitself, and expresses a simple respectus imitabilitatis with\nit; in the second, every such essence is taken as distinct, endowed\nwith a specific modus of being \u2014 esse essentiae\n\u2014 which nevertheless always derives from a relation of formal\nparticipation in the divine essence. In Henry's lexicon, these\ntwo moments indicate respectively the exemplar, which is the\ndivine idea, and the exemplatum (also called\nideatum), which is an essence fully constituted in its\nquidditative content and so able to be placed in act.\n\nExemplata, or essences, are thus secondary objects of\ndivine knowledge, indeed they are doubly so, and as such they seem to\nhave a purely mental being. In other words, they are diminished beings\n(entia diminuta), just like the contents of our mind. But the\ndivine intellect obviously does not have the same characteristics as\nours, since in order to know something our intellect needs to be\ninformed (per speciem) by its contents, and so is passive in a\nsense, whereas the divine intellect is itself the cause of its own\ncontents. Hence the level of existence that contents have in the divine\nintellect is not in any way comparable to that which they have in our\nintellect. Essences are therefore entia diminuta, though not\nso diminished that they cannot be something in themselves\n(Quodl. IX, q. 2). Their being is their quidditative\nconstitution, which also defines the effective possibility of access to\nactual existence: all essences, as thought of and therefore\n\u201cratified\u201d by God, are possible in themselves; that is,\nthey can be placed in act on the basis of divine free will.\n\n\nOne might ask whether God possesses this same freedom in bestowing\nesse essentiae on possible essences, that is, on (doubly)\nsecondary objects of His knowledge. Unlike what happens for the being\nof existence, the reply would seem to be negative in this case. As\nmentioned above, there is an asymmetry between the relation of\nefficient causality and the relation of formal dependence that conjoin\ncreatures and Creator: while the former is in time, the latter is\neternal. This means that the distinction between what is possible and\nwhat is not possible is necessarily such from eternity. Moreover, since\nessences can never cease to be in their essential being (that is, in\ntheir being eternally thought by God), they are absolutely necessary.\nAs such, not only can they not be destroyed, but they cannot even be\nmodified. In actual existence, all essences are equally indifferent\nwith regard to the Creator's power, so that God can place in act\none res before another as He chooses, without any mediation,\nwhereas in their own being essences are arranged in a hierarchical\norder that God himself, on whom that order depends, cannot modify.\n\n\nIn order to grasp this difference, we need only consider the first\ntwo questions of Quodlibet VIII, in which Henry distinguishes\nbetween the purely speculative knowledge that God has of essences and\nHis practical consideration of their possible actualization. Obviously,\nthere is no real difference between these two forms of knowledge, since\nin God practical ideas exist only as \u201cextensions\u201d of\nspeculative ideas. In other words, the very same rationes\nideales that God constitutes in Himself, by considering Himself\nvariously imitable by creatures, can be considered in scientia\npratica as the possible effects of His actions (\u201cquaedam\noperabilia\u201d). The difference between these two forms of knowledge\ndoes not lie in the diversity of the object, but rather in the\ndiversity of the aim; that is, in the fact that God can consider a\nthing as the result of a possible operation of His will. In this sense,\nGod knows what will effectively be placed in act, not by considering an\nessence in itself (every essence is indeed indifferent to actual\nexistence), but by considering the determination of His will in this\nregard.\n\n\nGod's will is as immutable and eternal as His knowledge; yet\nit is not constrained by the essential relation that binds ideas\ntogether. God has always known the individual entities that he will\nactualize in the various species, as well as those that he will not,\nyet His decision in this regard is absolutely free and does not\ncorrespond to any essential order. The concrete,\n\u201cpractical\u201d actualization of individual entities is not the\nsame as the formal, ontological possibility of essences. God constructs\nthe essential framework of the world through ideas and speculative\nknowledge, while it is through their practical extension that He freely\nbrings into being some of the creatures eternally constituted as\npossible. Yet there is no correspondence, strictly speaking, between\none order and another.\n\n\nTo illustrate this divergence Henry uses a particularly striking\nimage: possible existences are arranged in a circle around God, so that\nthey are all equidistant, while essences are arranged in a straight\nline, beginning with the noblest creature (the highest angel) and\nending with the lowest form of being (prime matter). Creatural essences\nare thus arranged as a hierarchical and essentially ordered whole; and\nthis is not a mere tautology, since \u201cessentially ordered\u201d\nrefers to those causal series in which the simultaneous presence of all\nterms is required for the production of an effect and in which,\nconsequently, a missing link in the chain is enough to invalidate any\nefficacy with regard to the effects. This means that while the second\nterm depends directly and exclusively on the first, the third depends\non the first and the second, the forth on the first three, and so on. A\nseries of this type is clearly neither open nor infinite, since if it\nwere there would no longer be an ordered relation between the\nterms.\n\n\nConcerning the case in question, this fact has at least two\nconsequences. In the first place, according to Henry, God cannot now\nintroduce ex novo a new essence in any part of the series\nwithout irremediably destroying the world order. Even if it were\npossible to add something at the beginning or at the end of the series\n\u2014 above the highest angel or below prime matter \u2014 then\nother infinite terms would be possible, too, and infinity in itself\ndestroys any ordered relation. From this perspective it is easy to\nunderstand Henry's reservation over the possibility of\ndistinguishing between potentia ordinata and potentia\nabsoluta in God, a distinction which he is more willing to accept\nin relation to papal authority (see below, \u00a711). God can do\nnothing de potentia absoluta that He cannot also do de\npotentia ordinata, since He himself is bound by the order that He\nhas eternally established. Supernatural intervention is thus delegated\nonly to the potentia oboedentialis of creatures, though it is\nnever outside the established order and merely indicates the\ndifference, within this order, between what is possible for natural\nagents and what is possible for a supernatural agent.\n\n\nIn the second place, since there is a perfect correspondence between\ncreatural essences and divine ideas, the latter are numerically finite,\nlike the former (Porro 1993). This theory, which is highly unusual to\nsay the least, is explicitly put forward by Henry on at least two\noccasions in his Quodlibeta (Quodl. V, q. 3 and\nQuodl. VIII, q. 8), before being partially retracted, albeit\nreluctantly, in virtue of an unspecified article condemned in Paris\n(Quodl. XI, q. 11).\n",
