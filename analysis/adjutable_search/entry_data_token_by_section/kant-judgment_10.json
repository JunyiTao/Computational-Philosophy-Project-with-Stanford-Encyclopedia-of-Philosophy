    "main_text": "Problems and Prospects\n4. Problems and Prospects\n\nThe basic parts of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment are now all in\nplace. In this concluding section, we will look briefly at several\nserious problems for Kant\u2019s theory. These problems, which come\nto a head in the debate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs.\nKant\u2019s non-conceptualism (see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism),\n all ultimately stem from the interplay between either the centrality\nthesis or the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the\ntranscendental ideality thesis. This in turn suggests that the other\ntwo parts of Kant\u2019s theory can be logically detached from his\ntranscendental idealism and defended independently of it.\n",
