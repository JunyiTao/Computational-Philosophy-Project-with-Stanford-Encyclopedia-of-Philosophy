    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past || Prior\u2019s Ockhamist Solution\n5.1 Prior\u2019s Ockhamist Solution\n\nIn Past, Present and Future Prior presented his so-called\nOckhamist system, which accepts (P5) but rejects (P3) (see Prior 1967,\np. 126 ff.). This system is inspired by some of the ideas formulated\nby William of Ockham.\n\nAs with the Peircean semantics, it is assumed that there is a\ntruth-function, TRUE, which gives a truth-value (0 or 1) for\nany propositional constant at any moment in TIME. On this basis, the\nvaluation function of an Ockhamist model, \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\) can be\ndefined recursively for any wff \\(p\\), any moment of time \\(t\\), and\nany chronicle \\(c\\) with \\(t \\in c\\):\n\n\n(a)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\TRUE(p,t)=1\\), where \\(p\\) is any propositional constant. \n\n(b)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p\\wedge q)=1\\)\niff\nboth \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\) and \\(\\Ock(t,c,q)=1\\) \n\n(c)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,{\\sim}p)=1\\)\niff\nnot \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\) \n\n(d)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,Fp)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p)=1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(t \\lt t'\\)\n\n\n(e)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,Pp) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p)=1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(t' \\lt t\\)\n\n\n(f)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,\\Diamond p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t,c',p)=1\\) for some \\(c' \\in C(t)\\) \n\n\nHere \\(C(t)\\) is defined as the set of chronicles through \\(t\\), i.e.,\n\\(C(t) = \\{c\\mid  t \\in c\\}\\).\n\nWe define the dual operators, \\(H, G\\), and \\(\\Box\\) in the usual\nmanner as \\({\\sim}P{\\sim}, {\\sim}F{\\sim}\\), and \\({\\sim}\n\\Diamond{\\sim}\\) respectively.\n\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) can be read \u2018\\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\) in the\nchronicle \\(c\\)\u2019. A formula \\(p\\) is said to be Ockham-valid if\nand only if \\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) in any \\(c\\) in any\nbranching time structure, (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C) and any valuation function\nTRUE. Here C should not be taken as an independent parameter.\nIn this case C is just the set of all maximally ordered linear subsets\nin (TIME,\\(\\le)\\). Furthermore, it should be noted that relative to a\nsingle chronicle, (a)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(e) are exactly the same\ndefinitions as those used in linear tense-logic (i.e. the tense-logic\nwhich follows if (TIME,\\(\\le)\\) is a linear structure).\n\nPrior himself did not accept the view represented in the Ockhamist\nsystem, but as many later researchers he was interested in the\nexploration of the system. It should be mentioned that the basic views\nheld by Belnap et al. (2001) are in fact rather close to\nPriorean Ockhamism, although there are certainly many further\ndevelopments of the theory in Belnap\u2019s philosophical writings on\nthe subject (Belnap 1992, 2002, 2003, 2005). Belnap has strongly\nemphasized the distinction between what he calls \u2018plain\ntruth\u2019 and \u201csettled truth\u201d. Whereas plain truth\ncorresponds to the branch-dependent truth used in the Ockhamistic\nmodel, settled truth will be branch-independent, i.e., truth at a\nmoment of time. It should also be pointed out that in the definition\nof \\(Ock\\), only (d) differs from the corresponding Peircean\ndefinition. In fact, Prior (1967, p.130) has pointed out that the\nPeircean system may be seen as a fragment of the Ockhamistic system in\nwhich \\(F\\) does not occur except as immediately preceded by an\nnecessity operator.\n\nTo obtain a metric version of the Ockhamist system, a duration\nfunction has to be added. Let \\(\\dur(t_1,t_2,x)\\) stand for the\nstatement \u2018\\(t_1\\) is \\(x\\) time units before \\(t_2\\)\u2019.\nUsing this formalism, (d) and (e) are replaced by:\n\n\n\\((\\text{d}')\\)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,F(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p) = 1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(\\dur(t,t',x)\\) \n\n\\((\\text{e}')\\)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,P(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p) = 1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(\\dur(t',t,x)\\) \n\n\nIt can be verified that neither \\(P(x)q \\supset \\Box P(x)q\\) nor \\(Pq\n\\supset \\Box Pq\\) are Ockham-valid for all \\(q\\). Let for instance\n\\(q\\) stand for \\(F(y)p\\). It is easy to verify that \\(P(x)F(y)p\n\\supset \\Box P(x)F(y)p\\) will not in general hold in an Ockhamistic\nbranching time model. This may be illustrated using the following\ndiagram, in which it is easily seen that \\(\\Ock(t, c_1, P(x)F(y)p) =\n1\\), whereas \\(\\Ock(t, c_1, \\Box P(x)F(y)p) = 0\\) since \\(\\Ock(t, c_2,\nP(x)F(y)p) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThis does away with (P3) in the formal version of the medieval\nargument discussed above. Still, both formulas, \\(P(x)q \\supset \\Box\nP(x)q\\) and \\(Pq \\supset \\Box Pq\\), will hold if the truth of \\(q\\)\ndoes not depend on what the future brings.\n\nIf (P3) does not hold in general, one may reject (2) in the argument\nin section 2. According to Ockham, (P3) (that is, its verbal analogue\nas he could formulate it with the means then available) should only be\naccepted for statements which are genuinely about the past, i.e.,\nwhich do not depend on the future. According to this view, (P3) may be\ndenied precisely because the truth of statements like\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\) has not been settled yet \u2014 since they depend\non the future.\n\nIn this way, one can make a distinction between \u201csoft\nfacts\u201d and \u201chard facts\u201d regarding the past (see\nPlantinga 1986; de Florio and Frigerio 2016). Following the Ockhamist\nposition, a statement like \\(P(x)q\\) would correspond to a hard fact,\nif \\(q\\) does not depend on the future, whereas statements like\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\) would represent soft facts. Critics of the Ockhamist\nposition, however, may still say that if \\(F(x)F(y)q\\) was true \\(x\\)\ntime units ago, then there must have been something making it true at\nthat time, and that something must have been a hard fact. On the other\nhand, supporters of the position hold that it is fully conceivable and\nacceptable that what makes a statement true could also be a soft fact,\ni.e., something which depends on the future.\n\nThe rationality of Ockham\u2019s suggestion according to which future\nhappenings can (in a very limited sense) influence the past, has been\ndefended by Alvin Plantinga (1986). It should also be mentioned that\nOckham\u2019s theory is relevant for the conceptual analysis of the\nidea of prophecy (see the entry on\n prophecy).\n\nHowever, it may be disputed that Prior\u2019s Ockhamist system fits\nthe ideas formulated by William of Ockham completely. Although many of\nOckham\u2019s original ideas are satisfactorily modelled in\nPrior\u2019s Ockhamist system, Prior\u2019s system (1967) lacks a\nproper representation of the notion of \u2018the true\n future\u2019.[4]\n This was in fact one of the most basic ideas in Ockham\u2019s world\nview. Ockham believed that there is truth (or falsity) also of\nstatements about the contingent future, which human beings cannot\nknow, but which God knows. Prior\u2019s Ockhamist system cannot be\nsaid to include more than the idea of a proposition being true\nrelative to a moment of time and a chronicle. A proper theory in\naccordance with William of Ockham\u2019s ideas would have to include\nthe idea of a proposition being true relative to a moment of time\n(without any specification of a chronicle). Let us therefore\ninvestigate a truth-theory which includes the idea of a true future in\nthis sense.\n",
