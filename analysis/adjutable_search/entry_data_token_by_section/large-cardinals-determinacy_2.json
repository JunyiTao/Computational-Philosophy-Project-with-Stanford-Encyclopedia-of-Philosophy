    "main_text": "Philosophical Motivation || Independence Phenomenon\n1.2  Independence Phenomenon\n\nWe noted above that the second incompleteness theorem provides us\nwith a case where the statement, namely, Con(T), leads to a\njump in the interpretability hierarchy while its negation does\nnot. There are also natural examples of this phenomenon\u2014for\nexample, large cardinal axioms. When a statement \u03d5 is independent\nof a theory T in this manner\u2014that is, in virtue of the\nfact that T < T + \u03d5\u2014we shall refer to the\nkind of independence involved as vertical independence. Thus,\nthe second incompleteness theorem demonstrated that Con(PA) is\nvertically independent of PA (assuming, of course, that PA is\nconsistent) and that the large cardinal axioms \u201cThere is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d is vertically independent of ZFC\n(assuming that ZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal\u201d is consistent). \n\n In contrast to vertical independence there is the kind of\nindependence that arises when a sentence \u03d5 is independent of a\ntheory T because \nT \u2261 T + \u03d5 and T \u2261 T + \u00ac\u03d5.\n\n Such a sentence \u03d5 is called an Orey sentence with\nrespect to T. We shall refer to this kind of independence\nas horizontal independence. Using metamathematical techniques\none can construct such sentences. But again, as in the case of\nvertical independence, there are also natural non-metamathematical\nexamples\u2014for example, PU (the statement that the projective sets\nhave the uniformization property, a property we shall discuss below)\nis a statement of (schematic) second-order arithmetic that is an Orey\nsentence with respect to ZFC, and CH is a statement of third-order\narithmetic that is an Orey sentence with respect to ZFC. \n",
