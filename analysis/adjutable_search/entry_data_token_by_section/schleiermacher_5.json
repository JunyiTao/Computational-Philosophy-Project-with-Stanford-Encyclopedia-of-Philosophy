    "main_text": "Theory of Translation\n6. Theory of Translation\n\nAs was already mentioned, Schleiermacher also develops his theory of\ntranslation on the foundation of the Herder-influenced principles in\nthe philosophy of language\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7),\n together with\n (8),\n his own semantic holism, which exacerbates the challenge to\ntranslation already posed by (7).\n\nSchleiermacher was himself a masterful translator, whose German\ntranslations of Plato are still widely used and admired today, about\ntwo hundred years after they were done. So his views on translation\ncarry a certain prima facie authority. He explains his theory\nof translation mainly in the brilliant essay On the Different\nMethods of Translation (1813). The following are some of his main\npoints:\n\n(a) Translation usually faces the problem of a conceptual gulf between\nthe source language and the target language (as the latter currently\nexists). (This is an application of principle\n (7).)\n\n(b) This situation makes translation an extremely difficult task,\nposing a major obstacle to the attainment of translation\u2019s\ntraditional primary goal, that of faithfully reproducing the original\nmeaning in the target language. In this connection, Schleiermacher in\nparticular notes the following problem (which might be dubbed the\nparadox of paraphrase): If, faced with the task of translating an\nalien concept, a translator attempts to reproduce its intension by\nreproducing its extension with the aid of an elaborate paraphrase in\nhis own language, he will generally find that as he gets closer to the\noriginal extension he undermines the original intension in other ways.\nFor instance, faced with Homer\u2019s color word\nchl\u00f4ros, a word that Homer sometimes applies to things\nthat we would classify as green (e.g., healthy foliage) but at other\ntimes to things that we would classify as yellow (e.g., honey), a\ntranslator might attempt to reproduce the extension correctly by\ntranslating the word as \u201cgreen or yellow\u201d. But in doing so\nhe would be sacrificing the original intension in other ways\u2014for\nHomer did not have either the concept green or the concept\nyellow (only the concept chl\u00f4ros), and in addition for\nHomer chl\u00f4ros was not a disjunctive\nconcept.\n\n(c) Schleiermacher also identifies a number of further challenges that\ncommonly exacerbate the difficulty of translation. For example, he\nnotes that in the case of poetry it is necessary to reproduce not only\nthe semantic but also the musical aspects of the original, such as\nmeter and rhyme\u2014and this not merely as a desideratum over and\nabove the main task of reproducing meaning, but also as an essential\npart of that task, because in poetry such musical features\nserve as essential vehicles for the precise expression of meaning. And\nhe argues that in addition to reproducing meaning a translation should\nattempt to convey to its readership where an author was being\nconceptually conventional and where conceptually original\u2014for\nexample, by using older vocabulary from the target language in the\nformer cases and relative neologisms from it in the latter. But he\nalso notes that in both of these connections the added requirement or\ndesideratum involved will frequently stand in tension with that of\nfinding the closest semantic fit\u2014since, for example, it will\nturn out that the word that would best reproduce a rhyme or best\nreflect a concept\u2019s vintage is not the one that is closest in\nmeaning to the word in the original.\n\n(d) Because of this great difficulty, the translator needs to possess\nreal interpretive expertise, and to be an \u201cartist\u201d, if he\nis to cope with the task of translation at all adequately.\n\n(e) The conceptual gulf that poses the central challenge here might in\nprinciple be tackled in one of two broad ways: either by bringing the\nauthor\u2019s linguistic-conceptual world closer to that of the\nreader of the translation or vice versa. The former approach had been\nchampioned, among others, by Luther in his classic Letter on\nTranslation (1530) and had been practiced by him in his\ntranslation of the Bible (he called it Verdeutschung,\n\u201cGermanizing\u201d, in a strong sense of the term). However,\nSchleiermacher finds it unacceptable, mainly because it inevitably\ndistorts the author\u2019s concepts and thoughts. Schleiermacher\ntherefore champions the alternative approach of bringing the reader\ntoward the linguistic-conceptual world of the author as the only\nacceptable one.\n\nBut how can this possibly be accomplished?\n\n(f) According to Schleiermacher, the key to a solution lies in the\nplasticity of language. Because of this plasticity, even if the usages\nof words, and hence the concepts, expressed by the target language\nas it currently exists are incommensurable with the\nauthor\u2019s, it is still possible for a translator to\n\n\nbend the language of the translation as far possible toward that of\nthe original in order to communicate as far as possible an impression\nof the system of concepts developed in it. (DM\n25)\n\n\n(This solution presupposes principle\n (5)\n in the philosophy of language.) For instance, the translator faced\nwith the task of translating Homer\u2019s word chl\u00f4ros\nwould select the closest counterpart in the target language, say\n\u201cgreen\u201d, but then modify its usage over the course of the\ntranslation so that it is applied not only to things that are green\n(e.g., healthy foliage) but also to things that are yellow (e.g.,\nhoney).\n\n(g) This approach entails a strong preference for translating any\ngiven word in the original in a uniform way throughout the translation\nrather than switching between two or more different ways of\ntranslating it in different contexts.\n\n(h) This approach also makes for translations that are considerably\nless easy to read than those that can be achieved by the alternative\napproach (Verdeutschung). However, this is an acceptable\nprice to pay given that the only alternative is a failure to convey\nthe author\u2019s meaning at all accurately. Moreover, the offending\npeculiarities have a positive value in that they constantly remind the\nreader of the conceptual unfamiliarity of the material that is being\ntranslated and of the \u201cbending\u201d approach that is being\nemployed.\n\n(i) In order to work at all effectively, though, this approach\nrequires that large amounts of relevant material be translated, so\nthat the reader of the translation becomes habituated to it and\nacquires enough examples of a particular word\u2019s unfamiliar use\nin enough different contexts to enable him to infer the unfamiliar\nrule for use that is involved.\n\n(j) Even this optimal approach to translation has severe limitations,\nhowever. In particular, it will often be impossible to reproduce the\nholistic aspects of meaning\u2014the several related usages of a\ngiven word, the systems of related words/concepts, and the distinctive\ngrammar of the language. And since these holistic features are\ninternal to a word\u2019s meaning, this will entail a shortfall in\nthe communication of its meaning by the translation. Reading a\ntranslation therefore inevitably remains only a poor second best to\nreading the original, and the translator should think of his task as\none of striving to approximate an infinite, never fully realizable,\nideal.\n\n(k) Translation is still amply justified, though\u2014not only for\nthe obvious reason that it is necessary in order to make works\navailable to people who want to read them but are not in the fortunate\nposition of knowing the original languages, but also for the less\nobvious reason that through its \u201cbending\u201d approach it\neffects a conceptual enrichment of their language (and through its\nreproduction of musical features a musical enrichment).\n\n(l) Nor (Schleiermacher adds in answer to a worry that Herder had\nexpressed) need we fear that this enrichment will deprive our language\nof its authentic character. For in cases where a real conflict with\nthat character arises, the enrichments in question will soon wither\nfrom the language.\n\n(m) Schleiermacher also argues that the sort of approach to\ntranslation that he advocates can only be successful under certain\nvery specific historical circumstances (which he takes to be present\nin the Germany of his own day), including a widespread interest in\nforeign cultures and a high degree of flexibility in the language.\n\nHere again (as in the case of interpretation), not only the framework\nprinciples\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7),\n but most of these ideas about translation come from Herder.\nIn particular, Schleiermacher\u2019s central strategy of\n\u201cbending\u201d the target language in order to cope with\nconceptual incommensurability, and his point that it is also important\nto convey the musical aspects of an original (poetic) text in order to\nconvey its meaning accurately, both do so. (Relevant Herderian sources\nhere are the Fragments on Recent German Literature\n[1767\u20138] and the Popular Songs [Volkslieder]\n[1774 and 1778/9].)\n\nHowever, unlike Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of interpretation,\nwhich, as was mentioned earlier, often worsens Herder\u2019s, this\ntheory of translation tends to refine Herder\u2019s in some modest\nbut significant ways. Among the ideas just adumbrated, examples of\nthis occur in (b), where Schleiermacher\u2019s paradox of paraphrase\nis largely novel; (c), where his ideal of making clear in a\ntranslation at which points the author was being conceptually\nconventional and at which points conceptually original is novel; (h),\nwhere his idea that the oddities that result from the\n\u201cbending\u201d approach are not only an acceptable price to pay\nbut can actually serve a positive function is novel; (i), which is a\nnovel point; (j), where the point that semantic holism imposes\nprincipled limitations on the successfulness of translations is novel;\n(l), which plausibly contradicts Herder; and (m), which is a novel\npoint.\n\nIndeed, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of translation constitutes a\ngreat landmark in the subject, and his 1813 essay is arguably the\nsingle most important work on it ever written. Not only are the\ntheory\u2019s central claims important and defensible, but it has\nalso exercised an enormous influence on subsequent translation\ntheories, such as those of Walter Benjamin or, more recently, Antoine\nBerman and Lawrence Venuti with their \u201cforeignizing\u201d\napproach. Moreover, it is often superior to these descendant theories\n(e.g., avoiding the religious mysticism that Benjamin adds and\npreserving the traditional concern with meaning that Berman and Venuti\nexclude).\n",
