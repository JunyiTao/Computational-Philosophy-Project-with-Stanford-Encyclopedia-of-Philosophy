Research in Experimental Philosophy\n\nThe best way to get a sense of what experimental philosophy is all\nabout is not just to consider it in the abstract but to look in detail\nat a few ongoing research programs in the field. Accordingly, we\nproceed in this section by reviewing existing research in four\nspecific areas: the negative program, free will, the impact of moral\njudgment, and epistemology.\n\nWe focus on these four areas because they have received an especially\nlarge amount of attention within the existing experimental philosophy\nof literature. We should note, however, that experimental philosophers\nhave explored an enormous range of different questions, and work in\nthese four specific areas comprises only a relatively small percentage\nof the experimental philosophy literature as a whole.\n",
