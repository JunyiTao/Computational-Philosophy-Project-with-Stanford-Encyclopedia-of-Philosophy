    "main_text": "Butch/FTM Border Wars and Border Zone Dwellers || Female Masculinity\n7.1 Female Masculinity\n\nIn \u201cF2M\u201d Halberstam seeks to undercut the representation of\nFTM transition as a more radical form of gender crossing than others\n(such as lesbian butch gender presentation) (1994, 212; 1998a, 289).\nShe points to the failure of the standard scheme (straight/ lesbian/\ntranssexual) in accounting for the multiple and highly specific forms\nof identity and desire in \u201cpostmodern lesbian identities.\u201d\nShe argues against the notion of crossing from one category to another\nin light of the proliferation of such identities situated at alleged\n\u201ccrossings\u201d (1994, 212). By this she means that such\nidentities can be taken in their own right as claiming ways of being in\nthe world that contest the very dominant categories that would situate\nthem as \u201ccrossings.\u201d\n\nHalberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of\n\u201csex-change\u201d serves to \u201cfictionalize\u201d gender\n(i.e., render or expose as artificial) (1994, 216). Likewise, she\nargues, alternative gender presentations involving attire or fantasy\ncan \u201cfictionalize\u201d gender, where in all cases the\n\u201cfiction\u201d requires a reader (221). These\n\u201cfictions\u201d may play a significant role in the identities\nand desire of individuals. The upshot is that there is nothing\ndistinctive about FTM transsexuality in \u201cfictionalizing\u201d\ngender. Rather a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example,\nlikewise fictionalizes it. \u201cSex-change\u201d and\n\u201ccross-dressing\u201d are largely on a par with regard to their\ncentral importance to identity and desire.\n\nIn light of this move, Halberstam notoriously remarks, \u201cWe are\nall transsexuals. There are no transsexuals\u201d (1994, 212) in order\nto underline the plurality of ways in which gender (as identity and\ndesire central) can be \u201cfictionalized.\u201d This attempt to\nundercut the specificity of FTM transsexuality drew fire from some FTM\ncircles and Halberstam later weakened her claim (1998a, 306). Her\npoint, however, (as she later explained), was to mark out space for the\nnotion of a transgender butch as a position which resisted a\ncontinuum in which lesbian butch masculinity is represented as less\nthan the fully achieved masculinity of FTM transsexuals (1998a,\n289).\n",
