    "main_text": "Moral Judgment and Motivation || Humeanism v. Anti-Humeanism\n3.1 Humeanism v. Anti-Humeanism\n\nLet\u2019s consider the second question first. Now one way in which\nmoral judgments could motivate, and, indeed, motivate on their own,\nwould be if moral judgments were not representational after all.\nSuppose moral judgments did not ascribe properties and express moral\nbeliefs about what things have those properties. Suppose instead, as\nmoral noncognitivism maintains, that moral judgments express\ndesires or other conative states\u2014what philosophers\nsometimes call \u201cpro-attitudes.\u201d Then it would be clear how\nmoral judgments connect to motivation. They simply express a\nmotivating state that the individual already has; to make a (sincere)\nmoral judgment is already to be motivated, at least to some degree.\nThe real puzzle as to how moral judgments can motivate arises for\nthose who maintain that moral judgments express moral\nbeliefs, for the connection between belief, a cognitive\nstate, and motivation is uncertain.\n\nHow philosophers resolve the puzzle turns on a central issue in moral\npsychology, namely, whether what is called the Humean theory\nof motivation is true. According to the Humean view, belief is\ninsufficient for motivation, which always requires, in addition to\nbelief, the presence of a desire or conative state. Moral motivation\nthus cannot arise from moral belief alone but must depend as well upon\na preexisting desire or other conative or intrinsically motivating\nstate. It would perhaps be fair to say that Humeanism continues to be\nthe dominant view. It has been held both by some who accept and by\nsome who reject cognitivism and moral realism, so it has not alone\nbeen considered decisive in settling broader issues in metaethics. The\nview has been held by noncognitivist anti-realists, for example, but\nalso by moral realists like Michael Smith (1994) and Peter Railton\n(1986a). A number of prominent philosophers, including Thomas Nagel\n(1970), John McDowell (1979), Mark Platts (1980), David McNaughton\n(1988), Jonathan Dancy (1993), Thomas Scanlon (1998), and Russ\nShafer-Landau (2003), have rejected the Humean picture, however,\narguing that, in fact, moral motivation does not depend on the\nexistence of desire: moral belief can itself give rise to\nmotivation.\n\nPrecisely how and under what conditions moral belief can itself\nmotivate is a matter of dispute among anti-Humeans. Some hold that\nmoral belief is sufficient to motivate directly. Merely believing that\nit is right, say, to keep a promise will move the believer, at least\nto some degree, to act so as to keep the promise. Others hold that\nmoral beliefs produce desires, which then motivate in conjunction with\nthe moral beliefs that produced them. Believing that it is right to\nkeep a promise produces a desire to do so, and these cognitive and\nconative states jointly move the believer, at least to some degree, to\nact so as to keep the promise. Certain virtue theorists offer a quite\nrefined version of the latter idea, arguing that only a particular\ntype of moral belief\u2014one tied to an ideal or complete conception\nof a situation in light of a more expansive understanding of how to\nlive\u2014necessarily generates in an individual the motivation to do\nas a moral belief of that type indicates she ought (Little 1997;\nMcDowell 1978). The virtuous person has not mere moral beliefs but a\ncomplex of moral belief and outlook which will reliably move her to\nbehave morally. Proponents of various anti-Humean views readily\nacknowledge that persons often fail to be moved and to act as they\nbelieve they ought. According to any of these views, however, a\nfailure of motivation springs from a cognitive failure.\n\nAs already noted, many have found the basic Humean picture most\nplausible. Before examining a few of the considerations thought to\nfavor it, we should make note of the fact that Humeanism does not\nitself commit one to any particular view as to the sorts of desires\nresponsible for moral motivation. A Humean might well take the view\nthat no particular desire is implicated in moral motivation. On the\ncontrary, varying desires may, when contingently present, move an\nindividual to do what she judges she ought to do, including the desire\nto be well regarded by her neighbors, to advance her interests in some\nway, or to promote the welfare of those who matter to her. Appealing\nsimply to some contingent desire or other may be inadequate, however,\nto explain the basic phenomenon of moral motivation. After all, what\nneeds to be explained, many would argue, is not merely how we may, on\noccasion or even frequently, be motivated to do as we think we ought:\nwhat needs to be explained is how we are reliably motivated\nto do as we think we ought. That includes explaining why motivation\nreliably shifts so as to track changes in our moral beliefs.\nAs we will see, those who accept the Humean picture have sometimes\nsuggested that we look to quite particular desires or to deep features\nof human psychology to explain moral motivation.\n\nOne argument in favor of the Humean picture alleges that if beliefs\nwere sufficient to motivate, then we would expect people with the same\nbeliefs to be motivated in the same way. In fact, however, whereas\nsome people are motivated by their moral belief, say, that\ncontributing to famine relief is a duty, to write a check to Oxfam,\nothers feel no such inclination whatsoever. But anti-Humeans claim\nthat they can explain away these differences by showing either that\ndifferential motivation is in fact due to other differences in belief\nor to motives that compete with and override the desires generated by\nmoral beliefs (Shafer-Landau 2003, 129\u2013130). \n\nA second argument in favor of Humeanism appeals to the view about\nreasons associated with Williams (1981), briefly discussed earlier.\nRecall that according to internalism about reasons or reasons\ninternalism, it is necessarily the case that if an individual has a\nreason to do an action, then he must be able to be motivated to do\nthat action. On a more specific version of the view, an individual has\na reason to do an action only if he has a desire to perform that\naction or to achieve some end that requires doing that action. If\ninternalism about reasons is correct, then when an individual\ncorrectly judges himself to have a reason to perform an action, he\nmust already have a preexisting desire. Anti-Humeans sometimes reject\nreasons internalism, as well as the Humean theory of motivation. But\neven allowing that reasons internalism is correct, they believe this\nsecond argument fails to undermine their position. For it seems\npossible that not all of our moral judgments involve the judgment\n(correct or otherwise) that we have a reason for action. An individual\ncould, for example, judge that it would be right to fulfill a promise\nwithout judging that she has a reason to do anything. What might\nexplain this? Perhaps, for instance, she fails to reflect on the\nconnection between what it is right to do and what one has reason to\ndo; or perhaps she mistakenly believes that truths about morally right\naction do not entail truths about what one has reason to do. If an\nindividual can judge an action right without judging that she has a\nreason to perform the action, then even if an action\u2019s being\nright entails a reason for action and reasons entail desires, moral\nbeliefs need not involve preexisting desires (Shafer-Landau 2003,\n 128\u2013129).[4]\n\nPerhaps the most sophisticated argument in favor of the Humean theory\nof motivation appeals to considerations in the philosophy of mind and\nmoral psychology, specifically, to fundamental differences between\nbelief and desire that would seem to count against\n anti-Humeanism.[5]\n Belief and desire, as a conceptual matter, it is argued, differ in\nwhat has been called their \u201cdirection of fit\u201d (Anscombe\n1963). They differ in such a way, it would seem, that belief states\ncannot entail desire states. Whereas beliefs aim to fit the world,\ndesires aim to change the world. That is to say, whereas beliefs have\na \u201cmind-to-world\u201d direction of fit, desires have a\n\u201cworld-to-mind\u201d direction of fit. For a mental state to\ncount as a belief, it must be at least somewhat responsive to evidence\nthat bears on the truth or falsity of its propositional content; that\nthe facts are contrary to a belief counts against it. In contrast,\nfacts contrary to the propositional content of a desire\u2014the fact\nthat the world is not currently as one wants\u2014need not count\nagainst that desire. Precisely because desires aim not to answer to\nthe world but to make the world answer to them (to make the world fit\ntheir propositional contents or what the desires are desires for),\nthey may well persist even when the world refuses to cooperate.\nAssuming the foregoing claims about belief and desire are true, so the\nargument goes, at least some versions of anti-Humeanism would require\nwhat is incoherent, namely, mental states with incompatible directions\nof fit: mental states that could be at once representational in the\nway that beliefs are and motivational in the way that desires are. But\nanti-Humeans would argue that their picture of moral motivation via\nmoral belief need involve no incoherence. To see this, we need merely\nconsider the possibility that a mental state could have\nopposing directions of fit so long as in exhibiting each direction of\nfit, the mental state was directed at different propositions: the\nvirtuous agent \u201cbelieves\u201d (belief direction of fit), say,\nthat a state of affairs S ought to be promoted and\n\u201cdesires\u201d (desire direction of fit) that S be brought\nabout (Little 1997,\n 64).[6]\n\nAnti-Humeans have offered various considerations\u2014some positive,\nothers negative\u2014to support their rejection of Humeanism. On the\nnegative side, they attempt to defeat considerations thought to favor\nthe Humean theory, as we have already seen in the course of exploring\nsome of those considerations. On the positive side, Anti-Humeans\nsometimes appeal to the phenomenology of moral motivation, arguing\nthat it supports their view. Ask the agent who is sorely tempted to do\notherwise why he ultimately acted as he believed morality required and\nhe will not report his desires at the moment of action; rather, he\nwill explain that he believed the action was the right thing to\ndo (Shafer-Landau 2003, 123). Our own experience and that of\nothers tells us that although our actions often arise from our\ndesires, sometimes they arise instead from our evaluative beliefs. As\nfurther support for these claims about the phenomenology of moral\nmotivation, Shafer-Landau has appealed to nonmoral cases in which\nmotivation seems to follow from belief. Consider the individual who\nconvinces herself that she has a desire she in fact lacks, such as the\ndesire to become a lawyer. She enrolls in law school only to find\nherself unmotivated by her coursework and dropping out of school,\nafter a summer spent working as a carpenter reveals her love of\ncarpentry (Shafer-Landau 2003, 125). What most plausibly explains the\nindividual\u2019s enrollment in law school and her half-hearted\nefforts during that first year would seem to be her mistaken belief\nthat she desired to become a lawyer. Given that many of our choices\nwill involve subjecting ourselves to tedious, even painful,\nexperiences\u2014experiences that surely none of us desire for their\nown sake\u2014the Humean owes us some explanation of our willingness\nto persist in such choices. The Humean will, it seems, be forced to\nappeal to some further desire we thereby seek to satisfy, such as, in\nthe case of the law school drop-out, the desire to become a lawyer.\nBut such an explanation will be implausible in cases in which we are\nmistaken about our desires. No compelling reason can be given to\naccept a desire-based explanation of our actions, Shafer-Landau\nargues, over the more straightforward explanation in terms of our\nbeliefs.\n\nYet Humeans would insist that there is nothing straightforward about\nattempts to explain moral motivation and action in terms of beliefs;\njust recall the argument for Humeanism based on differences in\n\u201cdirection of fit\u201d between belief and desire. Leaving that\nargument to one side, however, neither the phenomenology of moral\nmotivation nor cases in which individuals are mistaken about their\ndesires support the anti-Humean view. The fact that an individual may\ncite a belief rather than a desire in explaining why she did what she\njudged to be right does nothing to show either that her moral belief\ndirectly moved her to act or that it generated a desire that moved her\nto act. Individual self-reports are notoriously unreliable and can\nhardly settle so fundamental a question about moral psychology. As for\ncases in which individuals are (allegedly) mistaken about their\ndesires, common sense suggests that the Humean has the more\nstraightforward explanation. The Humean might argue that the law\nschool drop-out in fact did desire to become a lawyer, or at least to\nenroll in law school; she simply didn\u2019t understand what studying\nlaw would be like. Once she experienced it, she lost her desire to\ncontinue her studies. Alternatively, perhaps she really didn\u2019t\ndesire to become a lawyer, though she told herself that she did.\nStill, she was moved to enter law school not by her bare belief, but\nby a more deep seated, perhaps not fully conscious desire, such as the\ndesire to please her parents or to have the prestige or pay that comes\nwith being a lawyer. Anti-Humeans have given us no reason to favor\ntheir explanation over the Humean alternatives. Of course,\nanti-Humeans need not think the phenomenology, as they suppose it to\nbe, settles the dispute, but Humeans will insist that it does not even\ntend to favor the anti-Humean position.\n\nThe foregoing discussion does not, of course, cover every argument\nthat has been offered in the longstanding debate between Humeans and\nanti-Humeans, just a few of the ones that philosophers have evidently\nfound most persuasive. Whether and how the debate might be resolved\nremains uncertain, in part, because the nature of the dispute is\nrather unclear. Is it at bottom a conceptual dispute to be resolved,\nfor instance, by analysis of the concepts of belief and desire?\nPerhaps, though arguments that appeal to considerations in the\nphilosophy of mind and moral psychology have thus far proved less than\nfully convincing. Is the dispute instead fundamentally empirical? The\ntendency to appeal to common sense and the phenomenology of moral\naction would seem to betray some temptation to treat the issue as at\nleast partly empirical, though perhaps these appeals are meant to\nserve merely as a check on conceptual claims. Appeals to our\nexperience can, in any case, be just as well, and just as\ninconclusively, invoked by those on either side of the debate. In the\ncontext of warding off criticisms of the view that virtue is\nknowledge, Little (1997) suggests that the dispute is fundamentally\ntheoretical, implicating large and complex questions about the nature\nof agency, normativity, and responsibility. Whether or not that is so,\nLittle may be right in suggesting that the dispute will not be\nresolvable by appeal to merely local arguments of the sort we have\nconsidered. How plausible one finds either side may turn, in the end,\non the plausibility of the larger theories in which these views\nrespectively figure.\n",
