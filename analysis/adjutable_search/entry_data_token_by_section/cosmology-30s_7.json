    "main_text": "Cosmology and its philosophy || Kinematic Relativity\u2014an alternative cosmology\n3.3 Kinematic Relativity\u2014an alternative cosmology\n\nMilne\u2019s philosophy of cosmology came with a closely associated\ncosmological model, kinematic relativity, so-called because\nof its tight links to the kinematics of Einstein\u2019s Special\nTheory of Relativity. Kinematics, in Einstein\u2019s Special Theory,\nis especially concerned with observers trying to make measurements of\nthe behavior of objects moving in systems relative to themselves.\nAccording to Milne\u2019s understanding, these measurements could\nonly be made by the observers signalling among themselves using light\nor other electromagnetic radiation, using clocks to time the signals.\nIn the end, all measurement\u2014even space and\nvelocity\u2014reduced to timing the signals as they went from one\nobserver to another. This idea of measurement represented a\nrevolutionary simplification of previous ideas, and held philosophical\ninterest for that reason alone. There were practical consequences as\nwell. As Bondi later remarked, \u201cMilne\u2019s idea led\nstraightaway to the radar speed gun!\u201d\n\nMilne\u2019s kinematic relativity and its underlying philosophy both\nimmediately brought careful scrutiny, not to mention controversy.\n",
