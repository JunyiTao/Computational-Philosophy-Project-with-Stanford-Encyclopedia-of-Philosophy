Such a comparison makes sense at least if\nthe observation statements entailed by \\(T_{1}\\) are a proper subset\nof those entailed by \\(T_{2}\\). Kemeny and Oppenheim (1956) gave a\nsimilar condition in their definition of reduction: \\(T_{1}\\) is\nreducible to \\(T_{2}\\) if and only if \\(T_{2}\\) is at least as well\nsystematized as \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) is observationally stronger\nthan \\(T_{1}\\), i.e., all observational statements explained by\n\\(T_{1}\\) are also consequences of \\(T_{2}\\). Variants of such an\nempirical reduction relation has been given by the structuralist\nschool in terms of set-theoretical structures (Stegm\u00fcller 1976;\nScheibe 1986; Balzer et al. 1987; Moulines 2000). A similar idea, but\napplied to cases where the first theory \\(T_{1}\\) has been falsified\nby some observational evidence, was used by Lakatos in his definition\nof empirically progressive research programmes: the new superseding\ntheory \\(T_{2}\\) should have corroborated excess content relative to\n\\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) should contain all the unrefuted content of\n\\(T_{1}\\) (Lakatos and Musgrave 1970). The definition of Kuipers\n(2000) allows that even the new theory \\(T_{2}\\) is empirically\nrefuted: \\(T_{2}\\) should have (in the sense of set-theoretical\ninclusion) more empirical successes, but fewer empirical\ncounter-examples than \\(T_{1}\\). \n\nAgainst these cumulative definitions it has been argued that\ndefinitions of empirical progress have to take into account an\nimportant complication. A new theory often corrects the\nempirical consequences of the previous one, i.e., \\(T_{2}\\) entails\nobservational statements \\(e_{2}\\) which are in some sense close to\nthe corresponding consequences \\(e_{1}\\) of \\(T_{1}\\). Various models\nof approximate explanation and approximate reduction\nhave been introduced to handle these situations. An important special\ncase is the limiting correspondence relation: theory\n\\(T_{2}\\) approaches theory \\(T_{1}\\) (or the observational\nconsequences of \\(T_{2}\\) approach those of \\(T_{1})\\) when some\nparameter in its laws approaches a limit value (e.g., theory of\nrelativity approaches classical mechanics when the velocity of light c\ngrows without limit). Here \\(T_{2}\\) is said to be a concretization of\nthe idealized theory \\(T_{1}\\) (Nowak 1980; Nowakowa and Nowak 2000).\nHowever, these models do not automatically guarantee that the step\nfrom an old theory to a new one is progressive. For example, classical\nmechanics can be related by the correspondence condition to an\ninfinite number of alternative and mutually incompatible theories, and\nsome additional criteria are needed to pick out the best among\nthem.\n\nKuhn\u2019s (1962) strategy was to avoid the notion of truth and to\nunderstand science as an activity of making accurate predictions and\nsolving problems or \u201cpuzzles\u201d. Paradigm-based normal\nscience is cumulative in terms of the problems solved, and even\nparadigm-changes or revolutions are progressive in the sense that\n\u201ca relatively large part\u201d of the problem-solving capacity\nof the old theory is preserved in the new paradigm. But, as Kuhn\nargued, it may happen that some problems solved by the old theory are\nno longer relevant or meaningful for the new theory. These cases are\ncalled \u201cKuhn-losses.\u201d A more systematic account of these\nideas is given by Laudan (1977): the problem-solving\neffectiveness of a theory is defined by the number and importance\nof solved empirical problems minus the number and importance of the\nanomalies and conceptual problems that the theory generates. Here the\nconcept of anomaly refers to a problem that a theory fails to solve,\nbut is solved by some of its rivals. For Laudan the solution of a\nproblem by a theory \\(T\\) means that the \u201cstatement of the\nproblem\u201d is deduced from \\(T\\). A good theory is thus\nempirically adequate, strong in its empirical content,\nand\u2014Laudan adds\u2014avoids conceptual problems. \n\nOne difficulty for the problem-solving account is to find a proper\nframework for identifying and counting problems (Rescher 1984; Kleiner\n1993). When Newton\u2019s mechanics is applied to determine the orbit\nof the planet Mars, this can be counted as one problem. But, given an\ninitial position of Mars, the same theory entails a solution to an\ninfinite number of questions concerning the position of Mars at time\n\\(t\\). Perhaps the most important philosophical issue is whether one\nmay consistently hold that the notion of problem-solving may be\nentirely divorced from truth and falsity: the realist may admit that\nscience is a problem-solving activity, if this means the attempt to\nfind true solutions to predictive and explanatory questions\n(Popper, 1972; Niiniluoto 1984). Bird\u2019s (2007) main criticism\nagainst the \u201cfunctional account\u201d of Kuhn and Laudan is its\nconsequence that the cumulation of false solutions from an entirely\nfalse theory counts as scientific progress (e.g. Oresme in the\nfourteenth century believed that hot goat\u2019s blood could split\ndiamonds).\n\nAccording to Shan (2019), \u201cscience progresses if more useful\nresearch problems and their corresponding solutions are\nproposed\u201d. This definition involves both problem-defining and\nproblem-solving, as illustrated by the development of early genetics\nfrom Darwin to Bateson. Shan gives up the typical Kuhn-Laudan\nassumption that the scientific community is able to know whether it\nmakes progress or not, and is open to the introduction of the notions\nof know-how and perspectival truth, so that his \u201cnew functional\napproach\u201d is a compromise with what Bird (2007) calls the\n\u201cepistemic view\u201d of progress.\n\nA different view of problem-solving is involved in those theories\nwhich discuss problems of decision and action. A\nradical pragmatist view treats science as a systematic method of\nsolving such decision problems relative to various kinds of practical\nutilities. According to the view called behavioralism by the\nstatistician L J. Savage, science does not produce knowledge, but\nrather recommendations for actions: to accept a hypothesis is always a\ndecision to act as if that hypothesis were true. Progress in science\ncan then be measured by the achievement of the practical utilities of\nthe decision maker. An alternative methodological version of\npragmatism is defended by Rescher (1977) who accepts the realist view\nof theories with some qualifications, but argues that the progress of\nscience has to be understood as \u201cthe increasing success of\napplications in problem-solving and control.\u201d Similarly, Douglas\n(2014), after suggesting that the distinction between pure and applied\nscience should be relinquished, defines progress \u201cin terms of\nthe increased capacity to predict, control, manipulate, and intervene\nin various contexts.\u201d In this view, the notion of scientific\nprogress is in effect reduced to science-based technological progress\n(cf. Niiniluoto 1984).\n",
