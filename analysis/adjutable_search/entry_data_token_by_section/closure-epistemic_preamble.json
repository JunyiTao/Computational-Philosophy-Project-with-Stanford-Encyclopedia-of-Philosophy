    "main_text": "\n\nMost of us think we can safely enlarge our knowledge base by accepting\nthings that are entailed by (or logically implied by) things we know.\nRoughly speaking, the set of things we know is closed under entailment\n(or under deduction or logical implication), so we know that a given\nclaim is true upon recognizing, and accepting thereby, that it follows\nfrom what we know. This is not to say that our usual way of adding to\nour knowledge is simply to recognize and accept what follows from what\nwe already know. Obviously much more is involved. For instance, we\ngather data and construct explanations of those data, and under\nsuitable circumstances we learn from others. More to the point at\nhand, when we claim that we know, of some proposition, that it is\ntrue, that claim is itself subject to error; often, seeing what\nfollows from a knowledge claim prompts us to reassess and even\nwithdraw our claim, instead of concluding, of the things that follow\nfrom it, that we know that they are true. Still, it seems reasonable\nto think that if we do know that some proposition is true\nthen we are in a position to know, of the things that follow from it,\nthat they, too, are true. However, some theorists have denied that\nknowledge is closed under entailment. The arguments against closure\ninclude the following:\n\n\nThe argument from the analysis of knowledge: given the\ncorrect analysis, knowledge is not closed, so it isn\u2019t. For\nexample, if the correct analysis includes a tracking condition, then\nclosure fails.\n\nThe argument from nonclosure of knowledge modes: since the\nmodes of gaining, preserving or extending knowledge, such as\nperception, testimony, proof, memory, indication, and information are\nnot individually closed, neither is knowledge.\n\nThe argument from unknowable (or not easily knowable)\npropositions: certain sorts of propositions cannot be known\n(without special measures); given closure, they could be known\n(without special measures), by deducing them from mundane claims we\nknown, so knowledge is not closed.\n\nThe argument from skepticism: skepticism is false but it\nwould be true if knowledge were closed, so knowledge is not\nclosed.\n\n\nWhile proponents of closure have responses to these arguments, they\nalso argue, somewhat in the style of G. E. Moore (1959), that closure\nitself is a firm datum\u2014it is obvious enough to rule out any\nunderstanding of knowledge or related notions that undermines\nclosure.\n\nA closely related idea is that it is rational (justifiable) for us to\nbelieve anything that follows from what it is rational for us to\nbelieve. This idea is intimately related to the thesis that knowledge\nis closed, since, according to some theorists, knowing p\nentails justifiably believing p. If knowledge entails\njustification, closure failure of the latter might lead to closure\nfailure of the former.\n",
