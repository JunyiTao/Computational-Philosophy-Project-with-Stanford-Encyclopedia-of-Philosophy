    "main_text": "Transworld identity and the transitivity of identity || Chandler\u2019s transitivity argument\n5.1 Chandler\u2019s transitivity argument\n\nOne such argument is given by Chandler (1976). It can be illustrated\nsimply as follows (adapting Chandler\u2019s own example). Suppose\nthat there is a bicycle originally composed of three parts: A1, B1,\nand C1. (We might suppose that A1 is the frame, and B1 and C1 the two\nwheels.) Suppose we think that any bicycle could have been originally\ncomposed of any two thirds of its original parts, with a substitute\nthird component. We may call this (following Forbes 1985) \u2018the\ntolerance principle\u2019; it is a development of the intuitively\nappealing thought that it is too much to demand, of an object such as\na bicycle, that it could not have existed unless all of its\noriginal parts had been the same. Suppose, further, that we think that\nno bicycle could have been originally composed of just one third of\nits original parts, even with substitutes for the other two thirds.\nCall this \u2018the restriction principle\u2019. The combination of\nthese assumptions appears to generate a difficulty for the paraphrase\nof de re modal claims about bicycles in terms of transworld\nidentity. For if there is (as the tolerance principle allows) a\npossible world w2 in which our bicycle comes into\nexistence composed of parts A1 + B1 + C2, where C1 \u2260 C2, then, if\nwe apply the tolerance principle to this bicycle we must say\nthat it could have come into existence (in some further\npossible world w3) with any two thirds of\nthose parts, with a substitute third component: for example,\nthat it could have come into existence (in w3) composed of A1\n+ B2 + C2, where B1 \u2260 B2 and C1 \u2260 C2. The bicycle in\nw3 is, ex hypothesi, identical with the\nbicycle in w2, and the bicycle in\nw2 is, ex hypothesi, identical with the\noriginal bicycle; so, by the transitivity of identity, the bicycle in\nw3 is identical with the original bicycle. Hence\nour assumptions have generated a contradiction. We have a bicycle in\nw3, originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2, that both\nis identical with the original bicycle (by the repeated application of\nthe tolerance principle, together with the transitivity of identity)\nand is not identical with the original bicycle (by the restriction\nprinciple).\n\nOne might complain that the version of the tolerance principle cited\nabove is too lenient. Perhaps it is not true that the bicycle could\nhave come into existence with just two thirds of its original\ncomponents: perhaps a threshold of, say, 90% or more is required.\nHowever, the simple argument given above can be adapted to generate a\ncontradiction between the restriction principle and any tolerance\nprinciple that permits some difference in the bicycle\u2019s\noriginal composition, simply by introducing a longer chain of possible\nworlds. Thus the transitivity argument appears to force the proponent\nof transworld identity to choose between two implausible claims: that\nan object such as a bicycle has all of its original parts essentially\n(thus denying any version of the tolerance principle) and that an\nobject such as a bicycle could have come into existence with few (if\nany) of its original parts (thus denying any (non-trivial) version of\nthe restriction principle). Moreover, it is clear that the problem can\nbe generalized to any object to which versions of the tolerance\nprinciple and the restriction principle concerning its original\nmaterial composition have application, which appears to include all\nartefacts, if not biological organisms.\n\nIt seems legitimate to call this puzzle a \u2018problem of transworld\nidentity\u2019, for it turns partly on the transitivity of identity,\nand can be avoided by interpreting claims about how bicycles could\nhave been different (de re modal claims about bicycles) in\nterms of a counterpart relation that is not transitive (Chandler\n1976). Thus a counterpart theorist may admit that the bicycle could\nhave been originally composed of A1 + B1 + C2 rather than A1 + B1 +\nC1, on the grounds that (according to the tolerance principle) it has\na counterpart (in w2) that is originally so\ncomposed. And the counterpart theorist may admit that a bicycle (such\nas the one in w2) that is originally composed of\nA1 + B1 + C2 could have been originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2,\nsince (by the tolerance principle) it has a counterpart (in\nw3) that is originally so composed. However, since\nthe counterpart relation (unlike identity) is not transitive, the\ncounterpart theorist need not say that the bicycle in\nw3 that is originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2 is\na counterpart of the bicycle in the actual world\n(w1) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, for its\nsimilarity to the bicycle in w1 may be\ninsufficient to allow it to be that bicycle\u2019s counterpart. Thus\nthe non-transitivity of the counterpart relation (a relation based on\nresemblance) appears neatly to allow the counterpart theorist to\nrespect both the tolerance principle and the restriction principle,\nwithout falling into contradiction.\n",
