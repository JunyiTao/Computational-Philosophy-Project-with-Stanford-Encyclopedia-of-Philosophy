    "main_text": "Non-classical approaches to self-reference || Axiomatising Kripke\u2019s theory\n5.3 Adding a conditional\nField (2008) and others criticised theories based on partial logic\nfor the absence of a \u2018proper\u2019 conditional and\nbi-conditional. Various authors have proposed conditionals and\nbi-conditionals that are not definable in terms of \\(\\neg , \\vee\\) and\n\\(\\wedge\\). Field (2008) aims at an axiomatic theory of truth not\ndissimilar to PKF but with a new conditional. Feferman (1984) also\nintroduced a bi-conditional to a theory in non-classical logic. Unlike\nField\u2019s and his own 1984 theory, Feferman\u2019s (2008) theory DT is\nformulated in classical logic, but it\u2019s internal logic is again a\npartial logic with a strong conditional.\n",
