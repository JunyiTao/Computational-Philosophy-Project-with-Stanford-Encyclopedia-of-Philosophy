    "main_text": "Arguments from Ethical Supervenience || Arguments against realism\n3.1 Arguments against realism\n\nThe earliest influential discussions of what we now call supervenience\nin ethics focused on its significance for substantive ethical\ninvestigation. Henry Sidgwick draws from it what he takes to be a\n\u201cpractical rule of some value\u201d for such investigation\n(1907, 208\u20139). And G. E. Moore (1922) used the idea as part of\nhis attempt to explain the idea of intrinsic value. Given that Moore\nand Sidgwick were both ethical realists, it is perhaps striking that\nthe most influential philosophical use of ethical supervenience has\nbeen in arguments against ethical realism.\n\nIn his argument for error theory, J. L. Mackie briefly claims that\nsupervenience makes trouble for the realist. His quick argument can\nusefully serve as a prelude to the more detailed discussion to come.\nMackie suggests that we think that actions have their ethical\nproperties because they have some natural features. For\nexample, we think a certain action wrong because it is cruel. He\ndenies that this \u2018because\u2019 references a conceptual\nentailment, and thinks this raises two questions: (1) what sort of\nrelation is the connection being referred to? And (2) how do\nwe come to know that actions stand in this relation? (1977, 41). As it\nstands, Mackie\u2019s questions serve more as a research agenda than\nan argument (for important recent discussion, see Olson 2014,\n\u00a75.1). It appears plausible that realists should aim to have\nsomething illuminating to say both about the nature of the relation\nbetween the ethical and base properties, and a credible epistemology\nfor how we come to know such relations. But Mackie\u2019s questions\ndo not yet constitute an argument that realists cannot achieve these\naims.\n\nSimon Blackburn developed a more substantial supervenience argument\nagainst realism. The details of Blackburn\u2019s various\npresentations of his argument (1971, 1984, and 1985) are complex and\nraise difficult interpretive questions; the reconstruction that\nfollows is a rather free interpretation of Blackburn\u2019s (1984,\n183\u20134; for sympathetic discussion, see Mabrito 2005 and Mitchell\n2017). The argument starts with two claims:\n\nIt is conceptually necessary that if any two things are\nnaturalistically identical, then they are ethically identical\nNo specific naturalistic description (of an agent, action, state\nof affairs, etc.) conceptually entails an ethical description. (For\nexample, act-utilitarianism is not a conceptual truth, neither is\nKantianism, etc. Indeed, both act-utilitarianism and Kantianism are\nconceptually possible.)\n\n\nNow consider an act of happiness-maximizing promise-breaking. It\nfollows from (2) that is conceptually possible that the world is\nbase-identical to the actual world, and this act is wrong, but it is\nalso conceptually possible that the world is base-identical to the\nactual world, and this act is not wrong. But from (1), we can notice\nthat it is not conceptually possible that there are two\nbase-identical acts, one of which is wrong and one of which is\nnot.\n\nThis combination is supposed to be difficult for the realist to\nexplain. For (2) seems to show that there is no conceptual link\nbetween ethical concepts like \u2018wrong\u2019 and any one of our\nnaturalistic concepts. And if ethical concepts function to pick out\nproperties (as the realist claims), then given this conceptual\nseparation, it seems that we should be able to identify conceptual\npossibilities by arbitrarily \u201cmixing and matching\u201d\ndistributions of naturalistic and ethical properties. Ethical\nsupervenience precisely functions to limit such mixing and\nmatching.\n\nConsider four possible ways that the realist might reply. First, the\nrealist could seek to debunk the challenge. For example, she might do\nthis by denying that the ethical supervenes with conceptual necessity\n(see\n the previous section\n for discussion). Or she might reject the supervenience of the ethical\non the natural (see\n Section 1.1),\n and challenge Blackburn to identify a supervenience base for which\nthe argument remains potent.\n\nSecond, the realist might seek to explain the pattern of individual\nconceptual possibility without conceptual co-possibility. For example,\nif it were a conceptual truth that ethical properties were natural\nproperties, then this would explain the pattern of knowledge suggested\nhere (Dreier 1992, 20). An analogy may help to make this vivid: it\nmight be a conceptual truth that physical properties are natural\nproperties (compare Kim 2011). But which total naturalistic patterns\nin the world the physical properties covary with is arguably an\nempirical question. One might take these examples to illustrate a\ngeneral reply: the pattern is not puzzling, because it simply reflects\nthe limitation of our conceptually-based insight into reality\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, 86).\n\nThird, some realists are prepared to claim more ambitiously that we\ncan give a conceptual analysis of rightness in base terms\n(e.g. Jackson 1998, Ch. 5). Such philosophers can thereby deny (2),\ncutting the argument off at the knees. (Dreier 1992, 17\u201318\nsuggests that Blackburn\u2019s argument simply begs the question\nagainst this sort of reductive realist.) Such realists take on the\nburden of rejecting the most famous argument in metaethics: G. E.\nMoore\u2019s \u201copen question argument\u201d (1903, Ch. 1).\nHowever, it is a hotly contested question what\u2014if\nany\u2014probative value this argument has (for discussion, see\nsection 2 of the entry on\n moral non-naturalism).\n\nA fourth reply would be to shrug off the alleged explanatory\nchallenge. However allegedly puzzling the combination of the features\ndescribed by (1) and (2) are, they are consistent features of a\nconcept. This means that we could choose to introduce a concept that\nexemplified those features. It might thus be suggested that\nBlackburn\u2019s argument shows only that we have chosen to do so\nwith our ethical concepts (compare Olson 2014, 89\u201390). One might\nreply to this last point that it is precisely this choice that needs\nto be explained. Blackburn argues that the non-cognitivist has a\nsmooth functionalist explanation for why our ethical thought and talk\nincludes the ban on mixed worlds (see\n Section 3.3\n below for discussion), while for the realist, this might just be an\nunexplained peculiarity of our choice of concepts.\n",
