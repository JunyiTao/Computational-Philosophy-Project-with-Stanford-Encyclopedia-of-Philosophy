They also devoted extensive\ninvestigations to cases of intersubjective intentionality (intentional\nexperiences that require the existence of other persons). These\ninvestigations can be summarized under three main umbrella topics:\nsocial or speech acts, acts of empathy, collective acts.\n\nSocial Acts. An act is social if it stands under the\nrequirement of being understood by its addressee in order to be\nsuccessfully or happily performed. On this definition, acts like\npromises, orders, bets, apologies, and more in general: all so-called\n\u201cspeech\u201d acts, are social acts. (It is worth noting that\nthe concept of \u201csocial act\u201d as \u201csocial operation of\nthe mind\u201d can be found in Thomas Reid already, see Schuhmann\n& Smith 1990. Reid was not unknown within the two circles of\nphenomenology, see Peters 1909, but there is no solid evidence that\nearly phenomenologists adopted this idea from Reid, see Mulligan\n1987a: 33f n 5.) One main difference between the phenomenological and\nthe ordinary language approach to speech acts is that the tradition\ninaugurated by John Austin understands speech acts as conventional or\nritual actions (Austin 1962: 14), whereas phenomenology describes them\nas mental acts or experiences (Smith 1990).\n\nThe first steps towards a theory of social acts are made by\nPf\u00e4nder and Daubert. In his logic of imperatives (1909),\nPf\u00e4nder theorizes that the logical form of imperatives is\ndifferent from that of predicative sentences. This provides evidence\nfor the idea that the act of ordering something is not identical to\nthe judgment of having a certain conative experience. Daubert\ndeveloped extensive considerations about questions around 1911/12\n(Schuhmann & Smith 1987; despite his influential role within early\nphenomenology, Daubert never published a single line in his life and\nthe only sources available to scholars are unpublished manuscripts).\nIn these considerations, he describes various phenomena that are\nusually collated under the label of \u201cquestion\u201d, and argues\nthat, among various erotetic phenomena, one in particular should be\nset apart. While many erotetic phenomena are purely inner phenomena,\nwhen one raises a \u201cdirect question\u201d, then one addresses\nthe question to somebody else.\n\nIt is plausible to assume that Reinach\u2014who in 1913 presented the\nmost advanced and articulated theory of such acts within\nphenomenology\u2014developed his position in close dialogue with both\nPf\u00e4nder and Daubert (Reinach 1913b; see also Schuhmann 2004b;\nSmith 1990). In fact, Reinach expands on the ideas that social acts\nare not descriptions of inner experiences and that these acts have\naddressees. More specifically, Reinach defines social acts as all\nthose acts that are in-need-of-being-heard\n(vernehmungsbed\u00fcrftig, see Mulligan 1987a). A social act\nperformed between two or more human beings is heard (in this specific\nsense), according to Reinach, when three conditions are satisfied:\nfirst, the linguistic utterance is acoustically or visually perceived\nby the act\u2019s addressee; second, the addressee understands the\ncontent of the utterance; third, the addressee understands the type of\nthe act, that is, she understands whether a given utterance is a\npromise, an order, etc. Furthermore, social acts have illocutionary\neffects: a promise, e.g., generates a claim on the promisee\u2019s\nend and an obligation on the promisor\u2019s end. Finally, social\nacts undergo various modifications: they can be honest or treacherous,\nthey can be addressed to many and/or performed by many, they (or their\ncontents) can be conditional, they can be performed in the name of\nsomebody else.\n\nReinach\u2019s ideas have proven to be seminal for further\ninvestigations. For instance, von Hildebrand extends the idea of\nexperiences that are in need of being heard to emotions: accordingly,\nsome forms of love are claimed to exemplify that property as love can\nbe reciprocated only if the loved one is aware of being loved (von\nHildebrand 1930: 28f). Schapp applies Reinach\u2019s idea of promises\nas generators of claims and commitments to develop a theory of\neconomic contracts (1930). Also, Stein advances Reinach\u2019s theory\nby discussing the possibility for states to be subject of social acts\nand, especially, of enactments (1925, see Taieb forthcoming).\n\nEmpathy. We have seen that part of what it means for a social\nact to be happy is that the addressee grasps the act that is addressed\nto her. This presupposes the ability of understanding others and their\nmental states, which invites the question of how, in general, that is\npossible. An initial answer to this question is provided by Lipps, who\nadopts the notion of empathy (Einf\u00fchlung) from debates\nin aesthetics and claims that empathy is the specific experience,\nwhich enables social understanding. Empathy, according to Lipps,\nrelies on two innate drives: a drive to imitate others and a drive to\nexpress mental states. On Lipps\u2019 view, I understand that the\nother is sad, when the following happens: First, I should be aware\nthat, whenever I am sad, an inner drive leads me to express sadness.\nSecond, when I see the other\u2019s face, this triggers the drive of\nimitating his expression in me. Because in my mental life, that facial\nexpression has constantly been linked with sadness, having that\nexpression induces sadness in me. By feeling sad with the other, I\nproject sadness onto him (Lipps 1907a).\n\nThis understanding of empathy rapidly attracted criticisms in the\nMunich and G\u00f6ttingen circles. One of the most striking criticisms\nwas that Lipps\u2019 account is not able to explain the\nexplanandum: why the fact that the other\u2019s expression\ninduces a certain mental state in me (which I then project onto the\nother) is supposed to explain my understanding of the other\u2019s\nmental state? And can\u2019t I understand the other without living\nthrough his mental state? (see Zahavi 2014: 131f). As an alternative\nsolution, phenomenologists argue that mental states are not\nunobservable entities that lie \u201cbehind\u201d our bodily\nexpressions and gestures. Rather, mental states can be genuinely\nperceived: they are perceived in these very movements and gestures\n(see Scheler 1923).\n\nPerhaps one of the first explicit formulation of this idea is provided\nby Schwenninger in 1908. In his critical discussion of Hume\u2019s\nnotion of sympathy (which is also directed against Lipps),\nSchwenninger writes:\n\n\nthe consciousness of the mental state [Seelenzustand] is\nimmediately included in the perception of the gesture\n[Geb\u00e4rde]. I grasp something [and] this is what is\nexpressed in the expression; this means: in the grasp, an intimate\nconnection, unity, intertwinement [Ineinander] between\nexpression and expressed obtains. [\u2026] (1908: 44)\n\n\nImportantly, Schwenninger argues further:\n\n\nspeaking of perception here [that is, of perception as applied to\nmental states] is just as correct as speaking of perception in the\ncase of three-dimensional objects. [\u2026] The sympathizer [der\nSympathisierende] perceives that the other expresses certain\nmental experiences and, therefore, also perceives these experiences,\nbut he does not live through them himself, which just means that he\ndoes not have an adequate inner perception [of these experiences].\n(1908: 46f)\n\n\nThe ideas that mental states can be perceived in the gestures of\nothers and that the perceiver does not live through the other\u2019s\nexperience are the building blocks of early phenomenology\u2019s\ntheory of social cognition. In particular, Stein (1917) puts them at\nthe basis of her articulated view of empathy, according to which the\nperception of the other\u2019s mental state is only the first step in\nthe cognitive process that leads to a fuller understanding of the\nother. After one is struck, as it were, by the other\u2019s mental\nstate in perception, one has the possibility to put oneself in the\nother\u2019s shoes and, thereby, to explicate the experience (e.g.,\nby appreciating the intentional object of the state). In a third step,\nthe empathizer can gain a piece of propositional knowledge by forming\nthe thought that subject x lives through a given experience (see\nalso Dullstein 2013).\n\nCollective Acts. Paradigmatic cases of empathy or of social\nacts exemplify an I-Thou intentional relation where an I is\ndirected towards the other as a you. This relation should be\ndistinguished from the collective relation in which you and I share an\nexperience as ours. Interestingly, the phenomenological\ninvestigation into experiential sharing is part and parcel of a larger\ninvestigation into various forms of groups. The two topics are related\nbecause phenomenologists argue that different kinds of groups\ncorrelate with different kinds of social attitudes.\n\nThe starting point of this investigation is the distinction between\nsocieties, communities, and masses (Scheler 1913/16; Stavenhagen 1934;\nStein 1922; von Hildebrand 1930; Walther 1923). The distinction\nbetween societies and communities has been drawn originally by\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies (in his seminal book of 1887) and the\nintroduction of the mass as a different kind of group in the taxonomy\nshould be mainly credited to Scheler, who adopts it from French\nsociology (see Stavenhagen 1936: 20; Thonhauser forthcoming).\n\nWhat animates crowds is mental contagion, which is the psychological\nmechanism whereby the mental states of one individual pass (often\nunconsciously) to another individual. In crowds, individuals form\nmental states on the basis of others\u2019 mental states, but the\ninduced states are entertained without a reason. So, for instance, the\nwarranted joy of a subject x may infect individual y\nwho elicits an emotional episode of the same kind, but without having\na reason for it. This is what makes crowds different from societies:\nin societies, too, individuals form mental states on the basis of\nothers\u2019 mental states, but here the individuals take the\nother\u2019s mental state to be a reason for them to entertain their\nown states. For instance, agent x might form the intention to\nact with agent y (and vice versa) because x\nand y come to know that each of them pursues the same\ngoal.\n\nCrowds and societies should be distinguished from communities. Whereas\ncrowds are characterized by mental contagion and societies by\ninterlocked experiences (often based on instrumental considerations),\nmembers of communities share experiences. For instance, when two\nparents stand beside the dead body of their child, they mourn together\nand, thereby, share their experience of mourning (Scheler 1923: 23f).\nOne of the elements that sets experiential sharing apart from the\nprevious two forms of sociality is the sense of us that infuses the\nlife of the community members and that grounds solidary behavior among\nthem. Communal or collective experiences are lived through as\nours by the group members and that is why these members are\nprone to mutual help and support.\n\nThe pre-conditions of collective experiences are debated in early\nphenomenology. According to Walther, what makes an experience ours is\na complex structure of social cognition: the individuals, under\ncondition of common knowledge, empathize with each other and mutually\nunify, where \u201cunification\u201d is described as a particular\naffective state (see Le\u00f3n & Zahavi 2016; Zahavi &\nSalice 2016). Other authors, e.g., Stein, emphasize a rationality\nrequirement: among other conditions, for an experience to qualify as\ncollective, it has to be entertained for a group\u2019s reason.\nAccordingly, a single individual could live through a collective\nexperience as long as that experience is sustained by a group reason\n(Stein 1922: 123; Szanto 2015). Other authors, e.g., Stavenhagen, put\na self-understanding as a group member at the core of collective\nexperiences: for an experience to qualify as such, the subject must\nunderstand herself as belonging to a group. Interestingly, Stavenhagen\nidentifies several factors that could lead to that self-understanding\n(Salice forthcoming B): sharing preferences with others, having mutual\nrespect, or being part of an \u201cemotional tradition\u201d are\nelements that can elicit that particular self-understanding.\n",
