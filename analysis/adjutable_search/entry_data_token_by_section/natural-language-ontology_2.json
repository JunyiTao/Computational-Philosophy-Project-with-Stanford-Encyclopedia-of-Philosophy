    "main_text": "Natural Language Ontology as An Emerging Discipline and Practice || The Ontology of Natural Language and Its Relation to Reality\n1.3 The Ontology of Natural Language and Its Relation to Reality\n\nThere are various ways in which philosophers have used natural\nlanguage to clarify metaphysical intuitions. One of the most common\nways in which philosophers draw on language concerns the denotations\nof particular types of referential noun phrases (NPs). It is\na standard assumption in both philosophy and linguistics that\nreferential NPs stand for entities and predicates express properties\nof entities. The types of predicates acceptable with a particular type\nof referential NP are thus indicative of the ontological category of\nthe entities that that type of NP denotes. The types of NPs\nphilosophers make use of include bare adjective nominalizations like\nwisdom when arguing for qualities or properties, deverbal\nnominalizations like laughter when arguing for events,\nmodified adjective nominalizations like Socrates\u2019\nwisdom when arguing for tropes or particularized properties (see\nentry on\n tropes),\n NPs with a relational use of number such as the number\nof planets when arguing for numbers as objects, and\nfact-referring terms like the fact that it is raining or\nthe facts when discussing the nature and role of facts\n(Austin 1950; Strawson 1950). Other ways in which natural language\nappears to reflect ontology and which have played a role in philosophy\nwill be discussed later\n (\u00a72.2).\n\nThe appeal to natural language in the history of philosophy was\ngenerally based on the assumption that natural language just reflects\nreality and that natural language thus provides a particularly\nmanifest indication for the way reality should be understood. While\nthe view is still present in some of the ways in which contemporary\nmetaphysicians draw on natural language, there is another view that\nhas gained prominence, and that is that natural language does not in\nfact reflect the ontology of what there really is, or at least not\nfundamental reality. Rather, natural language comes with an ontology\nthat may be quite different from what many philosophers consider the\nontology of the real.\n\nFor example, a lot of referential NPs in natural language seem to\nstand for entities that many philosophers would not consider real, let\nalone fundamental. These include ontologically dependent, minor, and\nderivative objects such as holes, shadows, smiles, homes, problems,\nreasons, advantages, and mistakes, as well as construction-driven\nobjects such as pluralities like \u201cthe stones in the\ngarden\u201d\n (\u00a73.1.1),\n functional, variable, or intensional objects like \u201cthe\nincreasing temperature\u201d or \u201cthe book John needs to\nwrite\u201d\n (\u00a73.1.1),\n and intentional objects of the sort \u201cthe house John was\ndreaming about\u201d\n (\u00a73.2).\n\nThere are also predicates of natural language that reflect notions\nthat diverge from corresponding \u201cphilosophical\u201d notions,\nsuch as the verb exist, which cannot convey the univocal\nnotion that can be conveyed by philosophical uses of the noun\nexistence (as in the existence of everything there\nis)\n (\u00a71.2).\n\nAlso categorial distinctions such as the mass-count distinction, which\nincludes a distinction between \u201cthe water\u201d and \u201cthe\nquantity of water\u201d, \u201cthe rice\u201d and \u201cthe rice\ngrains\u201d, as well as \u201cthe clothes\u201d and \u201cthe\nclothing\u201d, are nowadays not generally taken to reflect a real\nontological distinction, but, at best, a distinction at a level of\n\u201cgrammaticized individuation\u201d\n (\u00a73.3).\n\nSuch discrepancies motivate distinguishing two ways of pursuing\nmetaphysics:\n\n metaphysics whose aim is to uncover the ontology\nreflected in natural language or intuitions more generally, that is,\ndescriptive metaphysics\n metaphysics whose aim is to uncover what there really\nis, that is, foundational metaphysics.\n\n\nThis distinction raises important questions itself, though.\n\nFirst of all, how should reality itself be understood? Does reality\njust consist in what is fundamental, and if so what entities or\nontological category would be fundamental (e.g., certain sorts of\nobjects, properties or facts), and in what sense of fundamentality?\n(see entries on\n fundamentality\n and\n metaphysical realism).\n Or does reality also include ordinary objects (which are generally\nnot considered fundamental), and perhaps entities ontologically\ndependent on them (such as tropes and events, or even entities like\nshadows and holes), and in what sense of ontological dependence (see\nentry on\n ontological dependence)?\n Or does reality consist of a much greater range of entities, even\nperhaps a plenitude of just anything x that is conceivable that\nmeets the conditions for x\u2019s existence (Eklund 2008;\nSchaffer 2009; entry on\n existence)?\n Does reality consist of a single level of being or different levels\nordered by relations of grounding or fundamentality, and would there\nbe a single such relation or a plurality of relations? (see entries on\n metaphysical grounding\n and\n fundamentality).\n Does reality come with a structure at all or is it an\n\u201camorphous lump\u201d, to be carved out in one way or another\nby language? Finally, should reality include a realm of mere\npossibilia and perhaps nonexistent, merely intentional objects (see\nentries on\n possible objects\n and\n nonexistent objects)?\n Depending on how reality itself is conceived, the ontology of natural\nlanguage may or may not be viewed as an ontology of the real (see also\n \u00a72.2.5).\n\nA second question is whether the two metaphysical projects can be\npursued independently of each other. While many contemporary\nmetaphysicians aim to pursue\n [ii]\n without engaging in\n [i],\n Fine (2017a) argues that the two branches of metaphysics cannot be\npursued independently, but that [ii] presupposes [i]: metaphysics that\naims to figure out what there really is has to take descriptive\nmetaphysics or what Fine calls \u201cna\u00efve metaphysics\u201d or\n\u201cthe metaphysics of appearances\u201d as its starting point,\nthat is, the metaphysics whose aim is to uncover the ontology\nreflected in our intuitions or ordinary judgments. That is because\nna\u00efve (or descriptive) metaphysics provides the clarification of\nthe metaphysical notions that foundational metaphysics aims to explain\nin more fundamental terms.\n\nA third issue is whether metaphysics that aims to uncover what there\nreally is can even be pursued in the first place. There have been\nvarious movements in metaphysics that deny that, including Kantian and\nphenomenological approaches\n (\u00a72.1).\n In fact, natural language ontology might very well be pursued while\ntaking a skeptical stance toward the metaphysics of the real.\n",
