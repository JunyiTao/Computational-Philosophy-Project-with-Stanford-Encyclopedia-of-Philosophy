    "main_text": "Moral motivation 2: the righteousness of morality || Locke\u2019s ethics of belief\n4.2 The special role of sanctions\n\nSanctions are not necessary to natural law if we consider it strictly\nas a system of divine rules. However, sanctions are necessary\nwhen morality functions as law. Sanctions are mechanisms for\nenforcement, where inherent motivating factors are either absent or\nunderappreciated. Consider, as an example, the moral duty to care for\none\u2019s children. For most people, this carries inherent obligatory\nforce arising from its being obviously good and necessary. Where a\nperson fails to appreciate the inherent force of this duty, however,\nlaws exist that require parents to provide the means of life and\neducation for their children, and such laws stipulate compliance under\nthreat of sanctions. To call the first instance a law seems\nunnecessary, but we can clearly see how the concept of a rule of law\ndistinguishes the latter case. Sanctions provide motives when\nindividuals fail to act on the responsibilities reason should on its\nown reveal and thereby compel. In the Essays on the Law of\nNature, Locke writes,\n\nThose who refuse to be led by reason and to own that in the matter of\nmorals and right conduct they are subject to a superior authority may\nrecognise that they are constrained by force and punishment to be\nsubmissive to that authority and feel the strength of him whose will\nthey refuse to follow. (Locke 1663\u201364, 117)\n\n\nSanctions thus ensure that people who \u2018refuse to be led\u2019\nby reason abide by the dictates of natural law; in this way, sanctions\nensure that divine moral rules function as a system of law.\n\nWhen Locke speaks of moral law, he frequently alludes to sanctions.\nMorality can motivate without sanctions, but it cannot ensure\ngeneral compliance in the way that a system of law can. God\u2019s\nimposition of sanctions is thus strictly instrumental. They are not\nintrinsic to a system of morality, but they are necessary when the\nobligatory force of moral rules is not adequately understood. The\nspecial role of sanctions as a means of shoring up moral compliance is\narticulated by Locke in several of his writings. In the 1680 essay\nOf God\u2019s Justice, he writes\n\nthough justice be also a perfection which we must necessarily ascribe\nto the supreme being, yet we cannot suppose the exercise of it should\nextend further than his goodness has need of it for the preservation\nof his creatures in the order and beauty of the state that he has\nplaced each of them in. (Locke 1680, 278)\n\n\nGod metes out justice in the form of sanctions as a means of ensuring\nsocial order and peace; sanctions ensure social good:\n\n[God\u2019s] justice is nothing but a branch of his goodness, which is fain\nby severity to restrain the irregular and destructive parts from doing\nharm; for to imagine God under a necessity of punishing for any other\nreason but this, is to make his justice a great imperfection. (Locke\n1680, 278)\n\n\nIn one of his more mature works, The Reasonableness of\nChristianity, Locke makes the point several times, that moral\nlaw, with its attendant rewards and punishments, was articulated as a\nmeans of ensuring obedience. Humans appreciate the intrinsic\nrighteousness of virtuous acts, which are generally granted the\nhighest degree of approbation. However, virtuous behaviour is assured\nonly when it is in an agent\u2019s interests to comply. It is clear to\nreason that we ought to act virtuously, but it is easy enough for many\nof us to eschew virtuous actions when they either present hardships or\nsacrifice of any kind or when they will not clearly benefit our own\ninterests:\n\nThe generality could not refuse [virtue] their esteem and\ncommendation; but still turned their backs on her, and forsook her, as\na match not for their turn. That she is the perfection and excellency\nof our nature; that she is herself a reward, and will recommend our\nnames to future ages, is not all that can now be said of her. (Locke\n1736, 247)\n\n\nIn order to remedy this problem, Locke explains, God attached clear\nand explicit sanctions (made plain through revelation) to ensure that\nthe virtuous course of action will always be the more attractive\noption:\n\n[Virtue] has another relish and efficacy to persuade men, that if they\nlive well here, they shall be happy hereafter. Open their eyes upon\nthe endless, unspeakable joys of another life, and their hearts will\nfind something solid and powerful to move them. The view of heaven and\nhell will cast a slight upon the short pleasures and pains of this\npresent state, and give attractions and encouragements to virtue which\nreason and interest, and the care of ourselves, cannot but allow and\nprefer. Upon this foundation, and upon this only, morality stands\nfirm, and may defy all competition. This makes it more than a name; a\nsubstantial good, worth all our aims and endeavours; and thus the\ngospel of Jesus Christ has delivered it to us. (Locke 1736, 247)\n\n",
