    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Ethics\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nGreen was perhaps the most important figure within the tradition of\nBritish idealism. But the significance of his idealism extends beyond\nthat tradition. His defenses of idealist metaphysics and epistemology\nand absolute idealism make interesting contributions to an idealist\ntradition that includes Berkeley, Kant, Fichte, Hegel, and Bradley,\namong others. His idealist approach to ethics embraces a perfectionist\ntheory of self-realization committed to rich conceptions of freedom\nand the common good that aims to synthesize the best elements in Greek\neudaimonism and Kantian rationalism. Though perfectionism is an\nunderappreciated tradition, Green makes enduring contributions to that\ntradition. Green\u2019s perfectionism leads him to develop a\nprogressive conception of liberalism that was influential in British\npolitics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and that\nbears comparison with contemporary conceptions of liberalism.\n",
