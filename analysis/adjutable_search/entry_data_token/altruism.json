What is altruism?\n\nBefore proceeding, further clarification of the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d is called for.\n1.1 Mixed motives and pure altruism\n\nAltruistic acts include not only those undertaken in order to do good\nto others, but also those undertaken in order to avoid or prevent harm\nto them. Suppose, for example, someone drives her car extra cautiously\nbecause she sees that she is in an area where children are playing, and\nshe wants to insure that she injures no one. It would be appropriate to\nsay that her caution is altruistically motivated. She is not trying to\nmake those children better off, but she is being careful not to make\nthem worse off. She does this because she genuinely cares about them for\ntheir sake.\n\nFurthermore, altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they\nremain altruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of\nmotives, some of which are self-interested. The driver in the\npreceding example may have plenty of time to get where she is going;\nslowing down and paying extra attention may not be contrary to her own\ngood. Even so, her act counts as altruistic if one of her\nmotives for being cautious is her concern for the children for their\nsake. She may also be aware that if she injures a child, she could be\npunished for reckless driving, which she of course wants to avoid for\nself-interested reasons. So, her caution is both altruistic and\nself-interested; it is not motivated by only one kind of reason. We\nshould not be confused by the fact that \u201cself-interested\u201d\nand \u201caltruistic\u201d are opposites. A single motive\ncannot be characterized in both ways; but a single act can be\nundertaken from both motives.\n\nIf someone performs an act entirely from altruistic motives\u2014if,\nthat is, self-interested motives are entirely absent\u2014we can\ndescribe her act as a case of \u201cpure\u201d altruism. We should\nbe careful to distinguish purely altruistic behavior from\nself-sacrificing behavior: the former involves no gain for oneself,\nwhereas the latter involves some loss. If someone has a theater ticket\nthat he cannot use because he is ill, and he calls the box office so\nthat the ticket can be used by someone else, that is a case of pure\naltruism, but it involves no sacrifice.\n1.2 Self-sacrifice, strong and weak altruism\n\nConsider someone whose deliberations are always guided by this\nprinciple: \u201cI shall never do anything unless doing so is best\nfor me\u201d. Such an individual is refusing ever to sacrifice his\nwell-being even to the slightest degree. But in view of the\nterminological points just made, he could have altruistic motives for\nsome of what he does\u2014or even for much or all that he does! On\nany given occasion, he could have mixed motives: he is careful always\nto do what is best for himself, but that allows him also to be\nmotivated by the perception that what he does is also good for others.\n\n\nIt would be odd or misleading to say that such an individual is an\naltruistic person. Many people would criticize him for being\ninsufficiently altruistic. It is part of common sense morality that\none should be willing to compromise with other people\u2014to\ncooperate with others in ways that require one to accept what is less\ngood for oneself than some other alternative, so that others can have\ntheir fair share.\n\nThese reflections lead to a peculiar result: each act undertaken by\nsuch an individual could be altruistically motivated, and yet we are\nreluctant, and reasonably so, to say that he is an altruistic person.\nThe best way to accommodate both ideas, which seem to be in tension,\nwould be to make a distinction between two uses of the word\n\u201caltruism\u201d. An act is altruistic in the strong sense if is\nundertaken in spite of the perception that it involves some loss of\none\u2019s well-being. An act is altruistic in the weak sense if it\nis motivated, at least in part, by the fact that it benefits someone\nelse or the fact that it will not injure anyone else. The individual\ndescribed two paragraphs above is someone who never acts\naltruistically in the strong sense. That policy seems objectionable to\nmany people\u2014even though he may act altruistically in the weak\nsense on many occasions.\n1.3 Moral motives and altruistic motives\n\nSome of what we do in our interactions with other people is morally\nmotivated but not altruistic. Suppose A has borrowed a book\nfrom B and has promised to return it within a week. When\nA returns the book by the deadline, his motive might be\ndescribed as moral: he has freely made a promise, and he takes himself\nto have an obligation to keep such promises. His motive is simply to\nkeep his word; this is not an example of altruism. But if A\ngives B a book as a gift, thinking that B will enjoy it\nand find it useful, he is acting simply out of a desire to benefit\nB. His motive in this case is altruistic. \n\nSimilarly, suppose a mother refrains from giving her adult son advice\nabout a certain matter because she thinks that it is not her place to\ndo so\u2014it would be interfering too much in his private affairs.\nEven so, she might also think that he would benefit from receiving her\nadvice; she respects his autonomy but fears that as a result he will\ndecide badly. Her restraint is morally motivated, but it would not\nnormally be described as an act of altruism.\n\nAs these examples indicate, the notion of altruism is applicable not\nto every morally motivated treatment of others, but more narrowly to\nwhat is done out of a concern for the good of others\u2014in other\nwords, for their well-being. Altruistic acts might be described as\ncharitable or benevolent or kind, for these words also convey the idea\nof acting for the good of others, and not merely rightly towards\nothers.\n\nOften the individuals who are the \u201ctargets\u201d of altruistic\nbehavior are selected for such treatment because of a personal tie\nbetween the benefactor and the beneficiary. If A was\nextraordinarily kind to B when B was a child, and at a\nlater time B is in a position to help A out of a\ndifficult situation, the help B gives to A is\naltruistically motivated, even though their common past explains why\nit is A that B has chosen to help (rather than a\nstranger in need). Here it is assumed that B is not promoting\nA\u2019s well-being as a mere means to his own\n(B\u2019s) own well-being. If that were so, B would not\nbe benefiting A for A\u2019s sake, but only for\nB\u2019s sake. (A further assumption is that B is not\nmotivated simply by a sense that he owes repayment to A;\nrather, he not only feels indebted to A but also genuinely\ncares about him.) The people whom we treat altruistically are often\nthose to whom we have a sentimental attachment, or towards whom we\nfeel grateful. But that is not the only possibility. Some altruistic\nacts are motivated simply by a recognition of the great need of those\nwho benefit from them, and the benefactor and beneficiary may be\nstrangers to each other. \n\nThat an act is altruistically motivated does not entail that it is\njustified or praiseworthy. A may mistakenly think that\nshe is enhancing the well-being of B; B might also\nmistakenly think that she is benefiting from A\u2019s\nefforts. We could say that in such cases there is something admirable\nabout A\u2019s motive, but nonetheless judge that she ought not\nto have acted as she did.\n1.4 Well-Being and perfection\n\nAs noted above, altruistic acts are guided by assumptions made by the\nagent about the well-being of some other individual or group. What\nwell-being consists in is a disputed matter, but it is uncontroversial\nthat a distinction must be drawn between (i) what constitutes\nwell-being and (ii) what is a necessary means towards or a\npre-condition of well-being. This kind of distinction is familiar, and\nis applicable in all sorts of cases. For example, we distinguish\nbetween what a breakfast consists in (cereal, juice, coffee) and the\nthings one needs in order to eat breakfast (spoons, glasses, mugs).\nThere is no such thing as eating breakfast but not eating anything\nthat breakfast consists in. In the same way, well-being must be sought\nand fostered by seeking and fostering the good or goods in which\nwell-being consists. Rival theories of well-being are competing ways\nof answering the question: what are its constituents? After we have\nanswered that question, we need to address the further question of how\nbest to obtain those constituents. (Contemporary discussions of\nwell-being can be found in Badhwar 2014; Feldman 1994, 2010; Fletcher\n2016; Griffin 1986; Kraut 2007; Sumner 1996 Tiberius 2018.)\n\nWell-being admits of degrees: the more one has of the good or goods in\nwhich it consists, the better off one is. It would be an awkward\nmanner of speaking to say of someone: \u201cshe has well-being\u201d.\nA more natural way to express that idea would be to use such terms as\nthese: \u201cshe is faring well\u201d, \u201cshe is well off\u201d,\n\u201cshe is flourishing\u201d, \u201cher life is going well for\nher\u201d. The constituents of well-being can also be spoken of as\nbenefits or advantages\u2014but when one uses these terms to refer to\nwell-being, one must recognize that these benefits or advantages are\nconstituents of well-being, and not merely of instrumental value.\nBenefits and advantages, in other words, fall into two categories:\nthose that are good for someone merely because they foster other\ngoods, and those that are good for someone in that they are\nconstituents of that individual\u2019s well-being.\n\nA distinction must be drawn between being good at something\nand having what is good for oneself. It is one thing to say,\n\u201che is good at acting\u201d and another to say \u201cacting is\ngood for him\u201d. Philosophers speak of the former as\n\u201cperfectionist value\u201d and the latter as \u201cprudential\nvalue\u201d. That is because when one tries to be good at something,\none hopes to move closer to the ideal of perfection. Prudential value\nis the kind of good that it would be in someone\u2019s interest to\nobtain\u2014it is another term that belongs to the group we have been\ndiscussing: \u201cwell-being\u201d, \u201cwelfare\u201d,\n\u201cbenefit\u201d, and so on.\n\nEven though perfectionist and prudential value must be distinguished,\nit should not be inferred that that being good at something is not a\nconstituent of well-being. To return to the example used in the\npreceding paragraph: if someone has great talent as an actor and\nenjoys acting and every aspect of theatrical life, it is plausible to\nsay that his well-being consists, at least to some extent, in his\nenjoyment of these activities. There are two different facts in play\nhere: (i) he is an excellent actor, and (ii) being an excellent actor\nis good for him (not as a mere means, but as a component of his\nwell-being). The value referred to in (i) is perfectionist value, and\nin (ii) prudential value. It would be prudent of him, in other words,\nto continue to excel as an actor.\n\nThese points about well-being and excellence are pertinent to a study\nof altruism because they help guard against a too narrow conception of\nthe sorts of goods that an altruist might promote in others. Altruists\ndo not aim only at the relief of suffering or the avoidance of\nharm\u2014they also try to provide positive benefits to others for\ntheir sake. What counts as a benefit depends on what the correct\ntheory of well-being is, but it is widely and plausibly assumed that\ncertain kinds of excellence are components of a good life. For\nexample, someone who founds a school that trains children to excel in\nthe arts and sciences, or in sports, simply so that they will enjoy\nexercising such skills, would be regarded as a great public benefactor\nand philanthropist. Similarly, teachers and parents who foster in\ntheir students and children a love of literature and the skills needed\nto appreciate it would be viewed as altruists, if they are motivated\nby the thought that by themselves these activities are benefits to\nthose students and children.\n\nHowever, it is possible for someone to be dedicated to excellence and\nat the same time to be utterly indifferent to human\nwell-being\u2014and when this happens, we have no inclination to say\nthat such a person is motivated by altruism. Someone might be devoted\nto a subject\u2014mathematics, or philosophy, or\nliterature\u2014rather than to the well-being of those who study and\nmaster that subject. For example, imagine a student of literature who\ncares deeply about James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, because he\ntakes it to be one of the supreme achievements of the human mind. He\ndoes not want that novel merely to gather dust on library\nshelves\u2014it deserves readers who love and understand it, and so\nthe skills needed to appreciate it must be kept alive from one\ngeneration to another. This kind of devotion to perfectionist value is\nnot a form of altruism.\n\nFor an act to be altruistically motivated is for the\nbenefactor\u2014not the beneficiary\u2014to have a certain\nattitude towards it. A child who acquires from a tennis instructor the\nskills of a good athlete and a love of the game may simply think of\ntennis as great fun\u2014not as something that benefits him or as a\nconstituent of his life going well. The child does not need to\npractice his skills because he believes that doing so is good for him:\nthat is not a necessary condition of his being the beneficiary of an\naltruistic act. Similarly, someone might deny that physical suffering\ncounts as something that is bad for him. (He should deny this,\naccording to the Stoics.) But on any plausible theory of well-being,\nhe is wrong about that; someone who aims to diminish the pain of\nanother individual, out of a concern for that individual\u2019s\nwell-being, is acting altruistically. \n\nTo take another example, consider someone who develops a love of\nphilosophy and immerses herself in the subject. When she asks herself\nwhether she is doing this for her own good, she may reply that her\nreasons are quite different. She may say, \u201cphilosophy is\nworthwhile in itself\u201d. Or: \u201cI want to solve the mind-body\nproblem and the free will problem because these are deep and important\nissues\u201d. If we suggested to her that her philosophical struggles\nare a component of her well-being, she might regard that as a strange\nway of looking at things. But her view is not\nauthoritative\u2014whether she is right depends on what the best\ntheory of well-being is. Others who care about her could plausibly\nbelieve that her love of philosophy is a component of her well-being,\nbecause it constitutes an enrichment and deepening of her mind, which is of value to her in itself, whether or not it leads to some further result. If they help her pursue her\nphilosophical interests simply for her sake, their motives would be\naltruistic, even if she herself does not care about philosophy because\nshe thinks it is good for her.\n2. Does altruism exist?\n2.1 Psychological egoism: strong and weak versions\n\nAccording to a doctrine called \u201cpsychological egoism\u201d, all\nhuman action is ultimately motivated by self-interest. The\npsychological egoist can agree with the idea, endorsed by common\nsense, that we often seek to benefit others besides ourselves; but he\nsays that when we do so, that is because we regard helping others as a\nmere means to our own good. According to the psychological egoist, we\ndo not care about others for their sake. Altruism, in other words,\ndoes not exist.\n\nSince we have distinguished several different ways of using the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d, it will be helpful to make similar\ndistinctions between different varieties of psychological egoism.\nRecall that an act is altruistic in the weak sense if it is motivated,\nat least in part, by the fact that it benefits someone else (or the\nfact that it will not injure anyone else). Psychological egoism, as\ndefined in the preceding paragraph, denies that altruism in this sense\nexists. That is the strongest form of this doctrine; it is usually\nwhat philosophers have in mind when they discuss psychological egoism.\nBut we can imagine weaker versions. One of them would deny that\naltruism is ever pure; it would say, in other words, that whenever we\nact, one of our motives is a desire for our own good. Another\nweaker form of psychological egoism would hold that we never\nvoluntarily do what we foresee will sacrifice our well-being to some\nextent. This third form of psychological egoism would admit that\nsometimes one of our reasons for acting is the good we do for others\nfor their sake; but it claims that we never act for the good of others\nwhen we think that doing so would make us worse off.\n2.2 An empirical argument for psychological egoism\n\nSomeone might arrive at one or another of these forms of psychological\negoism because she takes herself to be a keen observer of the human\nscene, and her acquaintance with other people has convinced her that\nthis is how they are motivated. But that way of justifying\npsychological egoism has a serious weakness. Others can say to this\npsychological egoist: \n\n\nPerhaps the people you know are like this. But my experience\nof the world is rather different from yours. I know many people who\ntry to benefit others for their sake. I myself act altruistically. So,\nat most, your theory applies only to the people in your social\nworld.\n\n\nThe psychological egoist can respond to this criticism in either of\ntwo ways. First, she might claim that his doctrine is supported by\nexperimental evidence. That is, she might believe that (i) the subjects\nstudied by psychologists in carefully conducted experiments have been\nshown to be not purely altruistic, or (more strongly) that these\nsubjects ultimately care only about their own good; and (ii) that we\ncan infer from these experiments that all human beings are\nmotivated in the same way.\n\nThis is a disputed matter. There is experimental evidence that casts\ndoubt on psychological egoism in its strong and in weaker forms, but\nthe controversy continues (see Batson 2011; Stich et al. 2010).\n2.3 An a priori argument for psychological egoism\n\nA second response on the part of the psychological egoist would\nconsist in an a priori philosophical argument for one or\nanother version of that doctrine. According to this line of thinking,\nwe can see \u201cfrom the armchair\u201d\u2014that is, without\nseeking empirical confirmation of any sort\u2014that psychological\negoism (in one of its forms) must be true.\n\nHow might such an argument go? Drawing upon some ideas that can be\nfound in Plato\u2019s dialogues, we might affirm two premises: (i)\nWhat motivates us to act is always a desire; (ii) all desires are to\nbe understood on the model of hunger (see Meno 77c;\nSymposium 199e\u2013200a, 204e).\n\nTo elaborate on the idea behind (ii): When we are hungry, our hunger\nhas an object: food (or perhaps some particular kind of food). But we\ndo not want to ingest the food for its own sake; what we are really\nafter is the feeling of satisfaction that we expect to get as a result\nof eating. Ingesting this or that piece of food is something we want,\nbut only as a means of achieving a sense of satisfaction or\nsatiation.\n\nIf all desire is understood in the same way, and all motivation takes\nthe form of desire, then we can infer that psychological egoism in its\nstrong form is true (and therefore its weaker versions are also true).\nConsider an action that seems, on the surface, to be altruistically\nmotivated: I give you a gift simply because I think you will like it.\nNow, since I want to give you this gift, and all desire should be\nunderstood as a kind of hunger, I am hungering after your feeling\npleased, as I hunger after a piece of food. But just as no one wants\nto ingest a piece of food for its own sake, I do not want you to feel\npleased for your sake; rather, what I am seeking is the feeling of\nsatisfaction I will get when you are pleased, and your being pleased\nis simply the means by which I achieve satisfaction. Accordingly, we\ndon\u2019t have to be keen observers of other people or look within\nourselves to arrive at psychological egoism. We can recognize that\nthis doctrine is correct simply by thinking about the nature of\nmotivation and desire.\n2.4 Hunger and desire\n\nBut the assumption that all desires are like hunger in the relevant\nrespect is open to question. Hunger is not satisfied if one still\nfeels hungry after one has eaten. It seeks a certain kind of\nconsciousness in oneself. But many kinds of desires are not like that.\nSuppose, for example, that I want my young children to be prosperous\nas adults long after I have died, and I take steps that increase to\nsome small degree their chances of achieving that distant goal. What\nmy desire is for is their prosperity far into the future, not my\ncurrent or future feeling of satisfaction. I don\u2019t know and\ncannot know whether the steps that I take will actually bring about\nthe goal I seek; what I do know is that I will not be alive when they\nare adults, and so even if they are prosperous, that will give me no\npleasure. (Since, by hypothesis I can only hope, and do not feel\nconfident, that the provisions I make for them will actually produce\nthe good results I seek for them, I get little current satisfaction\nfrom my act.) It would make no sense, therefore, to suggest that I do\nnot want them to be prosperous for their sake, but only as a means to\nthe achievement of some goal of my own. My goal is their well-being,\nnot my own. In fact, if I allocate to them resources that I myself\nneed, in the hope that doing so will make their lives better, I am\ndoing something that one form of psychological egoism says is\nimpossible: sacrificing my own good, to some degree, for the sake of\nothers. If the psychological egoist claims that such self-sacrifice is\nimpossible because all desire is like hunger, the reply should be that\nthis model does not fit all cases of desire.\n\nRecall the two premises used by the armchair psychological egoist: (i)\nWhat motivates us to act is always a desire; (ii) all desires are to\nbe understood on the model of hunger. The second premise is\nimplausible, as we have just seen; and, since both premises must be\ntrue for the argument to reach its conclusion, the argument can be\nrejected. \n2.5 Desire and motivation\n\nIt is worth observing, however, that first premise of this argument is\nalso open to question.\n\nThis thesis that what motivates us to act is always a desire should be\naccepted only if we have a good understanding of what a desire is. If\na desire is simply identified with whatever internal state moves\nsomeone to act, then the claim, \u201cwhat motivates us to act is\nalways a desire\u201d, when spelled out more fully, is a tautology.\nIt says: \u201cthe internal state that moves us to act is always the\ninternal state that moves us to act\u201d. That is not a substantive\ninsight into human psychology, but a statement of identity, of the\nform \u201cA = A\u201d. We might have thought we were\nlearning something about what causes action by being told, \u201cwhat\nmotivates people is always a desire\u201d, but if\n\u201cdesire\u201d is just a term for whatever it is that motivates\nus, we are learning nothing (see Nagel 1970: 27\u201332).\n\nHere is a different way of making the same point: As the words\n\u201cdesire\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d are often used, it makes\ngood sense to say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, but I think I\nought to\u201d. That is the sort of remark we often make when we take\nourselves to have an unpleasant duty or obligation, or when we face a\nchallenge that we expect to be difficult and stressful. In these sorts\nof situation, we do not hunger after the goal we move towards. So, as\nthe word \u201cdesire\u201d is often used, it is simply false that\nwhat motivates us to act is always a desire. Now, the psychological\negoist who seeks an a priori defense of this doctrine might\nsay: \n\n\nwhen I claim that what motivates us to act is always a desire, I am\nnot using the word \u201cdesire\u201d as it is sometimes used. My\nusage is much broader. Among desires, in this broad sense, I include\nthe belief that one ought to do something. In fact, it includes any\ninternal state that causes someone to act. \n\n\nClearly, the thesis that what moves us is always a desire, when so\nunderstood, is empty. \n\nThe common sense terms we often use to explain why we help others do\nnot need to refer to our own desires. You are in a public space and\ncome across someone off-putting in appearance but who seems to need\nyour help. He appears to be in pain, or confused, or needy in some\nway. Recognizing this, you take yourself to have a good reason to\noffer him your assistance. You think that you ought to ask him whether\nyou can help\u2014even though that will delay you and may cause you\nsome trouble and discomfort. These ways of describing your motivation\nare all that is needed to explain why you offered him your help, and\nit is not necessary to add, \u201cI wanted to help him\u201d.\nAdmittedly, when \u201cdesire\u201d is used to designate whatever it\nis that motivates someone, it is true that you wanted to help him. But\nwhat does the explanatory work, in these cases, is your recognition of\nhis need and your judgment that therefore you ought to offer your\nhelp. Saying, \u201cI wanted to help him\u201d would be misleading,\nsince it would suggest that there was something pleasant that you\nexpected to get by offering your assistance. After you have given him\nyour help, it is true, you might think back on this encounter, and be\npleased that you had done the right thing. But you might not\u2014you\nmight be worried that what you did actually made him worse off,\ndespite your good intentions. And in any case, if you do look back\nwith pleasure at your good deed, it does not follow that feeling good\nwas your goal all along, and that you merely used him as a means to\nthat end. That would follow only if desire by its very nature is a\nform of hunger.\n2.6 Pure altruism and self-sacrifice\n\nOf the three forms of psychological egoism distinguished above, the\none that is least open to objection is the weak form that holds that\naltruism is never pure. It claims that whenever we act, one\nof our motives is a desire for our own good. There is no good a\npriori argument for this thesis\u2014or, at any rate, the a\npriori argument we have been considering for the strongest form\nof psychological egoism does not support it, because the two premises\nused in that argument are so implausible. But it might nonetheless be\nsuggested that as a matter of fact we always do find some\nself-interested motivation that accompanies altruistically motivated\nbehavior. It is difficult to refute that proposal. We should not\npretend that we know all of the considerations and causes that\nunderlie our behavior. Some of our motives are hidden, and there is\ntoo much going on in our minds for us to be aware of the whole of our\npsychology. So, for all we know, we might never be pure altruists.\n\nBut what of the other weak form of psychological egoism?\u2014the one\nthat admits that sometimes one of our reasons for acting is the good\nwe do for others for their sake, but claims that we never act for the\ngood of others when we think that doing so would make us worse off. It\nsays, in other words, that we never voluntarily do what we foresee\nwill sacrifice our well-being to some extent. \n\nThe first point to be made about this form of psychological egoism is\nthat, once again, there is no a priori argument to support\nit. The two premises we have been examining\u2014that all action is\nmotivated by desire and all desire is like hunger\u2014are\nimplausible, and so they do not support the thesis that we never\nsacrifice our well-being to any degree. If this form of psychological\negoism is to be sustained, its evidence would have to be drawn from\nthe observation of each human being\u2019s reasons for acting. It\nwould have to say: when our motives are carefully scrutinized, it may\nindeed be found that although we do good to others for the sake of\nthose others, we never do so when we think it would detract even\nslightly from our own well-being. In other words, we count the good of\nothers as something that by itself gives us a reason, but it is always\na weak reason, in that it is never as strong as reasons that derive\nfrom our self-interest.\n\nWe have no reason to suppose that human behavior is so uniform in its\nmotivation. A far more plausible hypothesis about human motives is\nthat they vary a great deal from one person to another. Some people\nare never altruistic; others are just as this weak form of\npsychological egoism says: they are altruistic, but only when they\nthink this will not detract from their own well-being; and then there\nis a third and large category filled with people who, to some degree\nor other, are willing to sacrifice their well-being for others. Within\nthis category there is wide range\u2014some are willing to make only\nsmall sacrifices, others larger sacrifices, and some extraordinarily\nlarge sacrifices. This way of thinking has the great advantage of\nallowing our experience of each individual to provide us with the\nevidence by means of which we characterize him. We should not label\neveryone as an egoist on the basis of some a priori theory;\nrather, we should assess each person\u2019s degree of egoism and\naltruism on the basis of what we can discern of their motives.\n2.7 Does egoism exist?\n\nOne further point should be made about our reasons for supposing that\nthere is such a thing as altruism. Just as we can ask, \u201cwhat\nentitles us to believe that altruism exists?\u201d so we can ask:\n\u201cwhat entitles us to believe that egoism exists?\u201d Consider\nthe possibility that whenever we act for our own good, we are not\ndoing so only for our own sake, but also for the sake of someone else.\nOn what grounds are we entitled to reject that possibility?\n\nOnce again, the egoist might reply that it is an a priori\ntruth that all of our actions are ultimately motivated only by\nself-interest, but we have seen the weakness of the premises that\nsupport that argument. So, if the hypothesis that sometimes one acts\nonly for one\u2019s own sake is true, it must recommend itself to us\nbecause close observation of human behavior supports it. We must find\nactual cases of someone promoting his own good only for his\nown sake. It is no easier to be confident about such matters than it\nis easy to be confident that someone has acted out of purely\naltruistic motives. We realize that much of what we do for ourselves\nhas consequences for other people as well, and we care to some degree\nabout those other people. Perhaps our ultimate motivation always\nincludes an other-regarding component. It is more difficult to find\nevidence against that suggestion than one might have thought.\n\nTo take matters to an extreme, it might be suggested that our ultimate\nmotivation is always entirely other-regarding. According to this\nfar-fetched hypothesis, whenever we act for our own good, we do so not\nat all for our own sake, but always entirely for the sake of someone\nelse. The important point here is that the denial that altruism exists\nshould be regarded with as much suspicion as this contrary denial,\naccording to which people never act ultimately for their own good.\nBoth are dubious universal generalizations. Both have far\nless plausibility than the common sense assumption that people\nsometimes act in purely egoistic ways, sometimes in purely altruistic\nways, and often in ways that mix, in varying degrees, the good of\noneself and the good of others.\n3. Self and others: some radical metaphysical alternatives\n\nAn assumption that many people make about egoistic and altruistic\nmotives is that it is more difficult to justify the latter than the\nformer, or that the former do not require justification whereas the\nlatter do. If someone asks himself, \u201cWhy should I take my own\ngood to be a reason to do anything?\u201d it is tempting to respond\nthat something is amiss in the very asking of this\nquestion\u2014perhaps because there can be no answer to it.\nSelf-interest, it might be said, can be given no justification and\nneeds none. By contrast, since other people are other, it\nseems as though some reason needs to be given for building a bridge\nfrom oneself to those others. In other words, we apparently have to\nfind something in others that justifies our taking an interest in\ntheir well-being, whereas one need not seek something in oneself that\nwould justify self-regard. (Perhaps what we find in others that\njustifies altruism is that they are just like oneself in important\nrespects.) It is worth asking whether this apparent asymmetry between\njustifying self-interest and justifying altruism is real or only\napparent.\n\nOne response to this question is that the asymmetry is illusory\nbecause the very distinction between oneself and others is artificial\nand an obstacle to clear thinking. One can begin to challenge the\nvalidity or importance of the distinction between self and others by\nnoticing how many changes occur in the inner life of what is,\nconventionally speaking, a single \u201cperson\u201d. The mind of a\nnewborn, a child, an adolescent, a young adult, a middle aged person,\nand an old person approaching death\u2014these can have at least as\nmany differences as do those who are conventionally counted as two\ndistinct individuals. If a young man of twenty years sets aside money\nto provide for his retirement in old age, he is saving for someone who\nwill be quite different from himself. Why should that not be called\naltruism rather than self-interest? Why does it matter whether it is\ncalled acting for his own good or for the good of another? (See Parfit\n1984.)\n\nAnother kind of challenge to the validity of the distinction between\nself and others derives from the observation made by David Hume that\nwhen we look within and make an inventory of the contents of our\nmental life, we have no acquaintance with any entity that would\nprovide a reference for the word \u201cself\u201d. Introspection can\ntell us something about sensations, feelings, and thoughts\u2014but\nwe do not have any experience of some entity that is the one who has\nthese sensations, feelings, and thoughts. That point might be regarded\nas a reason to reject the common sense view that when you refer to\nyourself, and distinguish yourself from someone else, there is\nsomething real that you are talking about, or some valid distinction\nbetween yourself and others. It might be thought, in other words, that\nthe ordinary distinction between altruistic and egoistic motives is\nmisguided because there are no such things as selves.\n\nA third metaphysical possibility is this: human beings cannot be\nunderstood one by one, as though each were a self-sufficient and fully\nreal individual. That way of thinking about ourselves fails to\nrecognize the profound way in which we are by our nature social\nbeings. You and I and others are by our nature mere parts of some\nlarger social unit. As an analogy, one might think of the human body\nand such parts of the body as fingers, hands, arms, legs, toes, torso,\nand so on. They cannot exist, much less function properly, in\nisolation. Similarly, it might be said that individual human beings\nare mere fragments of a larger social whole. Accordingly, instead of\nusing the concepts expressed by the terms\n\u201cself-interested\u201d and \u201caltruistic\u201d, we should\nsee ourselves as contributors to the success and well-functioning of\nthe larger community to which we belong (see Brink 2003; Green\n1883).\n\nThe remainder of this essay will set aside these unorthodox\nalternatives to the common sense metaphysical framework that we\nnormally presuppose when we think about self-interested and altruistic\nmotives. It would take us too far afield to examine them. We will\ncontinue to make these assumptions: First, a single individual human\nbeing persists over time from birth to death, even when the mental\nlife of that individual undergoes many changes. Second, there is\nsomeone one is referring to when one talks about oneself, even though\nthere is no object called the \u201cself\u201d that we detect\nintrospectively. And the fact that we do not encounter such an object\nby introspection is no reason to doubt the validity of the distinction\nmade between oneself and others. Third, although certain things (arms,\nlegs, noses, etc.) are by their very nature parts of a whole, no human\nbeing is by nature a part in that same way. Rejecting these ideas, we\nwill continue to assume, with common sense, that for each human being\nthere is such a thing as what is good for that human being; and that\nthe questions, \u201cwhat is good for me?\u201d, \u201cwhat is good\nfor that other individual, who is not me?\u201d are different\nquestions. Accordingly, it is one thing for a reason to be\nself-interested, and another for it to be altruistic (although of\ncourse one and the same act can be supported by both kinds of\nreasons).\n\nAssuming, then, that the distinction between these motives is real,\nthe questions we asked at the beginning of this section remain: Why\nought one to be altruistic? Does one need a justification for being\nmotivated in this way? Is egoistic motivation on a sounder footing\nthan altruistic motivation, in that it stands in no need of\njustification?\n4. Why care about others?\n\nRadically different ways of answering these questions can be found in\nmoral philosophy. The first makes self-interested motivation\nfundamental; it holds that we should be altruistic because it is in\nour interest to be so moved. That strategy is often attributed to the\nGreek and Roman philosophers of antiquity\u2014Plato, Aristotle, the\nStoics, and the Epicureans (see Annas 1993).\n\nIn the modern era, a second approach has come to the fore, built on\nthe notion that moral thinking is not self-centered but impartial and\nimpersonal. Its basic idea is that when we think morally\nabout what to do, reason takes a god\u2019s-eye perspective and sets\naside the emotional bias we normally have in our own favor, or in\nfavor of our circle of friends or our community. Here Kant 1785 is a\nrepresentative figure, but so too are the utilitarians\u2014Jeremy\nBentham 1789, John Stuart Mill 1864, and Henry Sidgwick 1907. \n\nA third approach, championed by David Hume (1739), Adam Smith (1759),\nand Arthur Schopenhauer (1840), gives sympathy, compassion, and\npersonal affection\u2014rather than impartial reason\u2014a central\nrole to play in the moral life. It holds that there is something\nextraordinarily valuable in the sentimental bonds that take hold among\nhuman beings\u2014a feature of human life that is overlooked or\ndistorted when morality is understood solely or primarily in\nimpersonal terms and from a god\u2019s-eye point of view. In\nfavorable conditions, we naturally and emotionally respond to the weal\nand woe of others; we do not and should not look for reasons to do so.\n(The assorted ideas labeled \u201csentimentalism\u201d in this entry\nare an amalgam of ideas derived loosely from the writings of Blum\n1980; Noddings 1986; Slote 1992, 2001 2010, 2013; and others. The term\nis sometimes applied to a family of meta-ethical views that ground the\nmeaning or justification of moral propositions in attitudes rather\nthan response-independent facts (Blackburn 2001). Here, by contrast,\nsentimentalism is a ground-level thesis about what is most valuable in\nhuman relationships. It could be combined with meta-ethical\nsentimentalism, but need not be.)\n\nThese three approaches are hardly an exhaustive survey of all that has\nbeen said in the Western philosophical tradition about altruism. A\nfuller treatment would examine the Christian conception of love, as\ndeveloped by thinkers of the medieval period. To a large extent, such\nfigures as Augustine and Aquinas work within a eudaimonistic\nframework, although they are also influenced by the Neoplatonic\npicture of the visible world as an outpouring of the bountifulness of\ndivine goodness. To the extent that rewards of heaven and the\nsufferings of hell play a role in a theocentric framework, there are\ninstrumental reasons, for those who need them, to care for others. But\nthere are other reasons as well. Other-regarding virtues like charity\nand justice are perfections of the human soul and are therefore\ncomponents of our earthly well-being. Christian philosophy rejects\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine that divine being has no ethical qualities\nand makes no interventions in human life. God is a person who loves\nhis creation, human beings above all. When we love others for\nthemselves, we imitate God and express our love for him (Lewis\n1960).\n4.1 Eudaimonism\n\nThe term \u201ceudaimonism\u201d is often used by philosophers to\nrefer to the ethical orientation of all or the major philosophers of\nGreek and Roman antiquity. \u201cEudaimonia\u201d is the\nordinary Greek word they apply to the highest good. As Aristotle\nobserves at the beginning of the Nicomachean Ethics, whenever\nwe act, we aim at some good\u2014but goods are not all at the same\nlevel. Lower goods are undertaken for the sake of more valuable goals,\nwhich are in turn pursued in order to achieve still better goods. This\nhierarchy of value cannot continue endlessly\u2014a life must have\nsome ultimate goal, something that is valuable in itself and not for\nthe sake of anything still better. What that goal should be, Aristotle\nacknowledges, is a much disputed matter; but at any rate, everyone\nuses the word \u201ceudaimonia\u201d to designate that\nhighest good. (\u201cHappiness\u201d is the standard translation,\nbut \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201cflourishing\u201d may be\ncloser to the Greek word\u2019s meaning.)\n\nAristotle does not say that one\u2019s ultimate goal should be\none\u2019s own well-being (eudaimonia) and no one\nelse\u2019s. On the contrary, he holds that the common\ngood (the good of the whole political community) is superior to the\ngood of a single individual. Nonetheless, it has become common among\nscholars of ancient ethics to attribute to Aristotle and the other\nmajor moral philosophers of antiquity the assumption that one\u2019s\nultimate goal should just be one\u2019s own well-being.\n\nIs this an implausible assumption? That is the accusation of many\nsystems of modern moral philosophy, but one must be careful not to\nattribute to Greek and Roman ethics an extreme endorsement of\nselfishness. One way to see that this would be unfair is to recognize\nhow important it is to Aristotle that we love others for their\nsake. That is a key ingredient of his lengthy discussion of\nfriendship and love in Books VIII and IX of the Nicomachean\nEthics. There he argues that (i) friendship is an ingredient of a\ngood life, and (ii) to be a friend to someone (or at any rate a friend\nof the best sort) one must not treat him as a mere means to\none\u2019s own advantage or one\u2019s own pleasure. He elaborates\non (ii) by adding that in friendships of the best sort, each\nindividual admires the other for the excellence of that other\nperson\u2019s character, and benefits him for that reason. It is\nclear, then, that he explicitly condemns those who treat others as\nmere means to their own ends. So, even if it is true that, according\nto Aristotle, one\u2019s ultimate goal should be one\u2019s own\nwell-being (and no one else\u2019s), he combines this with the denial\nthat the good of others should be valued solely as a means to\none\u2019s own.\n\nIt is crucial, at this point, that we keep in mind the distinction,\ndrawn above in\n section 1.4,\n between (i) what constitutes well-being and (ii) what is a necessary\nmeans towards or a pre-condition of well-being. Aristotle argues that\none\u2019s well-being is constituted by the excellent use of\none\u2019s reason, and that such virtues as justice, courage, and\ngenerosity are among the qualities in which one\u2019s good consists.\nWhen one acts with justice and generosity towards one\u2019s family,\nor friends, or the larger community, that is good for oneself (one is\nachieving one\u2019s ultimate goal) and it is also good for\nothers\u2014in fact, one\u2019s action is motivated in part by the\ndesire to benefit those others for their sake. If treating\nothers justly and in accordance with the other ethical virtues were\nmerely a means towards one\u2019s own well-being, Aristotle\u2019s\nframework for ethics would be objectionably self-regarding\u2014and\nit would be difficult for it to endorse, without inconsistency, the\nthesis that we ought to benefit others for their sake.\n\nWe should recall a point made in\n section 1.1:\n altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they remain\naltruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of motives,\nsome of which are self-interested. For Aristotle, altruism should\nalways be accompanied by self-interested motives. His system\nof practical thought could be dismissed out of hand if one begins with\nthe assumption that moral motivation must be purely altruistic, free\nfrom all taint of self-regard. Otherwise, it would not count as\nmoral. That idea has some currency, and it is often\nattributed (rightly or wrongly) to Kant. But on reflection, it is open\nto question. If it is the case that whenever one has a good reason to\nbenefit someone else for that person\u2019s sake, there is also a\nsecond good reason as well\u2014namely, that in doing so one will\nalso benefit oneself\u2014it would be implausible to suppose that one\nshould not let that second reason have any influence on one\u2019s\nmotivation.\n\nNonetheless, if another point made earlier is correct, there\nis a serious problem for Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonism. In\n section 1.2,\n we noted that someone is open to criticism if he is always guided by\nthe principle, \u201cI shall never do anything unless doing so is\nbest for me\u201d. Such a person seems insufficiently altruistic,\ninsufficiently willing to make compromises for the good of others. He\nis (to use the term introduced earlier) never altruistic in the strong\nsense. Aristotle, it might be said, would have been on firmer ground\nif he had said that ultimately one should act for one\u2019s own good\nand that of others. (To be fair to him, he does not deny\nthis; on the other hand, he does say that treating others well never\nmakes one worse off.)\n\nIf the project undertaken by Greek and Roman moral philosophy is to\nbegin with the unquestioned assumption that one should never act\ncontrary to one\u2019s own good, and that one\u2019s ultimate end\nshould be only one\u2019s own eudaimonia, it faces the serious\nobjection that it will never be able, on this basis, to give proper\nrecognition to the interests of others. The idea underlying this\nobjection is that we should be directly concerned with\nothers: the fact that an act one performs benefits someone\nelse can already provide a reason for undertaking it, without\nhaving to be accompanied by a self-interested reason. There\nis no argument to be found in ancient ethics \u2013none is\noffered\u2014that purports to show that the only way to justify\nhaving other-regarding motives is by appealing to the good it does\noneself to have them.\n\nAt the same time, that gives us no reason to dismiss out of hand the\nefforts made by these authors to show that in fact one does benefit by\nhaving altruistic motives. There is nothing morally offensive about\nasking the question: \u201cis it good for someone to be a good\nperson?\u201d once it is understood that being a good person might be\na component of well-being, not a means to further private\nends. As noted earlier\n (section 1.4),\n certain kinds of excellence are widely assumed to be components of a\ngood life. The examples used there were excellence in the arts, the\nsciences, and sport. But excelling at ethical life is also a plausible\nexample, since it consists in developing and exercising cognitive,\nemotional, and social skills that we are pleased and proud to have. In\nany case, it would be sheer dogmatism to close our minds and refuse to\nlisten to the arguments found in Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics that\nethical virtue is of great value because it is a component (and for\nthe Stoics the sole component) of one\u2019s well-being.\n4.2 Impartial Reason\n\nWe turn now to the idea, central to one modern approach to ethics,\nthat when we think morally, we reason from an impartial or impersonal\nperspective. Moral thinking is not self-centered. Of course we all\nhave an emotional bias that attaches special weight to self-interest,\nand we are often partial to our particular circle of friends or our\ncommunity. But when we look at the world from a moral point of view,\nwe try to set aside this self-centered framework. Taking a god\u2019s\neye perspective on things, we ask ourselves what one ought to\ndo in this or that situation\u2014not what would be good for me or my\nfriends. It is as though we forget about locating ourselves as this\nparticular person; we abstract away from our normal self-centered\nperspective and seek the solution to a practical problem that anyone\nsimilarly impartial would also arrive at.\n\nWe can find anticipations or analogues of this idea in ancient\nethics\u2014for example, in Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nrecognition that the political community serves the common\ngood rather the interest of some one class or faction; and in the\nStoic belief that the cosmos is governed by a providential force that\nassigns to each of us a distinctive role by which we serve not just\nourselves but also the whole. In the ideal city of Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, the family and private property are abolished\nwithin the elite classes, because these institutions interfere with\nthe development of a common concern for all individuals. It is not\nclear how these ideas can be made to fit within a eudaimonistic\nframework. How can the good of the community serve as the highest\nstandard of evaluation if one\u2019s own good alone is one\u2019s\nhighest end? One way of looking at the history of ethics would be to\nsay that modern ethics salvages the impartialism that occasionally\nappears in ancient ethics, and rightly abandons its attempt to derive\na justification of altruism from a prior commitment to self-interest.\nContemporary eudaimonists, of course, would tell a different story\n(see, for example Annas 1993; LeBar 2013; Russell 2012).\n\nThe notion of impartiality has thus far been described in highly\ngeneral terms, and it is important to see that there are different\nways of making it more concrete. One way of doing so is adopted by\nutilitarians, and more generally, by consequentialists. (The\nutilitarianism of Bentham 1789, Mill 1864, and Sidgwick 1907 holds\nthat one is to maximize the greatest balance of pleasure over\npain\u2014treating pleasure and the absence of pain as the sole\nconstituents of well-being. Consequentialism abstracts away from this\nhedonistic component of utilitarianism; it requires one to maximize\nthe greatest balance of good over bad. See Driver 2012.) In their\ncalculus, no individual\u2019s good is given greater weight or\nimportance than any other\u2019s. Your own good, therefore, is not to\nbe treated by you as having greater weight as a reason than anyone\nelse\u2019s, simply because it is your own good. The well-being of a\nhuman being (or of a sentient creature) is what provides one with a\nreason to act: that is why one has a reason to take one\u2019s own\ngood into consideration in practical thinking. But the same point\napplies equally and with equal force to the well-being of anyone\nelse.\n\nBut that is not the only way of taking the general notion of\nimpartiality and making it more specific. The general idea, as stated\nearlier, is that moral thinking, unlike prudential thinking, is not\nself-centered. One can make this idea more concrete by taking it to\nmean that there is a single set of rules or norms that apply equally\nto all human beings, and so the standard by which one answers the\nquestion, \u201cwhat should I do in this situation?\u201d is the\nstandard by which one answers the question, \u201cwhat should anyone\ndo in this situation?\u201d Someone whose practical reasoning is\nguided by this condition is abiding by an ideal of impartiality. He\nmakes no special exceptions for himself or his friends.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you are a lifeguard and one afternoon you\nmust choose between swimming north to rescue one group and swimming\nsouth to rescue another. The northern group includes your friend, but\nthe southern group, full of strangers, is much larger. The ideal of\nimpartiality described in the previous paragraph does not by itself\ndetermine what one should do in this situation; what it requires is\nsimply that it should make no difference that the lifeguard faced with\nthis dilemma is you (and the northern group includes\nyour friend). What you should do, if you are the\nlifeguard, is what any lifeguard ought to do in that\nsituation. If it is right to take friendship into consideration, when\nmaking this decision, then it would be right for anyone to do so.\n(What would be right, in that case, would be for each individual to\nchoose the good of his or her friend over the good of\nstrangers.)\n\nThe consequentialist has a more radical interpretation of what\nimpartiality means and requires. His ideal of impartiality does not\nallow the lifeguard to take into consideration the fact that by\nswimming north he will be able to save his friend. After all,\nthe well-being of his friend is not made more valuable simply\nbecause that person is his friend. Just as my good is not\nmade more valuable than the good of others simply because it is\nmy good, so too the well-being of my friend deserves no extra\nweight because he is a friend of mine. So, the lifeguard,\naccording to the consequentialist, must choose to save one group\nrather than the other solely on the basis of the greater balance of\ngood over bad. \n\nThe consequentialist will correctly point out that quite often one is\nin a better position to promote one\u2019s own good than that of\nothers. As a rule, I have more knowledge about what is good for me\nthan I have about what is good for strangers. It often requires fewer\nresources for me to benefit myself than to benefit others. I know\nimmediately when I am hungry without having to ask, and I know what\nkind of food I like. But additional steps are needed to find out when\nothers are hungry and which food they like. These sorts of facts about\none\u2019s special relationship to oneself might allow the\nconsequentialist to justify giving somewhat more attention to\none\u2019s own well-being than that of anyone else. Even so, there is\nonly one individual who is me; and the number of other individuals\nwhom I can benefit, if I make the effort, is very large. When all of\nthese factors are taken into consideration, it will often be the case\nthat self-interested reasons ought to give way to altruistic\nmotives.\n\nConsequentialism evidently does not recognize certain ways in which\neach human being has a special relation to her own well-being\u2014a\nrelation different from the one she has to the well-being of others.\nWhen each of us becomes an adult, we are normally charged with the\nspecial responsibility of having to look after our own welfare. Young\nchildren are not expected to be in command of their own lives; they\nare not yet competent to occupy this role. But the point of their\neducation is to train them so that as adults they can be responsible\nfor themselves. A fully mature person is rightly expected by others to\ncare for someone in particular\u2014namely herself. She is given room\nto make decisions about her own life but is not given the same kind\nand degree of authority over the lives of others. If she would like to\ndevote herself to others, she cannot simply do so without receiving\ntheir permission, or without taking other steps that make her entry\ninto their lives permissible. Consequentialism, by contrast, regards\nall adult human beings as equally responsible for the well-being of\nall. It does not take seriously the idea that our social relations are\ngoverned by a division of labor that charges each with a special\nresponsibility for herself\u2014and certain others as well\n(one\u2019s children, one\u2019s friends, and so on.)\n\nAccording to the weaker interpretation of impartiality described\nabove, moral rules reflect this division of labor. (By the\n\u201cweaker interpretation\u201d is meant the thesis that moral\nthinking avoids being self-centered because it upholds a single set of\nrules or norms that apply equally to all human beings.) Consider, for\nexample, the duty we normally have to help others, even when they are\nstrangers. If someone is in need, and asks for your assistance, that\ngives you a reason to help him, and you should do so, provided\nthat compliance with such appeals is not overly burdensome.\nNotice the escape clause: it builds into the duty to aid others a\nrecognition of the importance of each person having a significant\ndegree of control over his own life. Common sense morality assumes\nthat what we owe to others might call for some sacrifice of our own\ngood, but also that in the ordinary business of life the degree of\nsacrifice should fall within certain limits, so that we can make good\nuse of the responsibility we have been given as adults to seek our own\ngood. The balance struck by moral rules between the claims of\nself-interest and the claims of others is what makes it possible for\nthose rules to be recognized and accepted as appropriate. These rules\nleave us free to volunteer to make greater sacrifices; but such\ngreater sacrifices are not required of us except in extraordinary\ncircumstances (wars, disasters, emergencies).\n\nThe three approaches to altruism that we have examined thus far give\nthree rather different answers to the question: \u201cwhy should one\nact for the sake of others and not only for one\u2019s own\nsake?\u201d \n\nEudaimonism replies that those who act for the sake of others are\nbenefited by having an altruistic disposition.\n\nThe consequentialist\u2019s answer begins with the claim that\none\u2019s own well-being ought to be of concern to oneself simply\nbecause it is someone\u2019s well-being; it should not be of\nimportance to oneself simply because it is one\u2019s own well-being.\nThere is, in other words, no reason why a benefit should go to you\nrather than someone else just because you are the one who would be\nreceiving it. Accordingly, if one assumes, as one should, that one\nshould act for one\u2019s own sake, then one has no less a reason to\nact for the good of anyone and everyone else.\n\nIf we adopt a weaker interpretation of impartiality, we see the\njustification of altruism simply by seeing that we have a duty to aid\nother people in certain circumstances. The moral rule that requires us\nto help others is a rule that calls upon us to help them not as a\nmeans to our own good, but simply in virtue of their need. And we see\nthe rule as justified by recognizing that it strikes a proper balance\nbetween our self-concern and the appropriate claims of others.\n\nNotice that both consequentialism and the weaker impartialist position\nare compatible with the eudaimonist\u2019s thesis that having\naltruistic motives is a component of one\u2019s own well-being. What\nthese two forms of impartialism reject is the stronger eudaimonistic\nthesis that one\u2019s ultimate goal should be one\u2019s own\nwell-being and that alone.\n\nThat stronger eudaimonistic thesis and consequentialism stand at\nopposite poles from each other, in the following respect: The first of\nthese poles elevates the self to a position of primacy, since it is\nonly one\u2019s own well-being that constitutes one\u2019s ultimate\ngoal; by contrast, consequentialism, at the opposite extreme, deflates\nthe self to the point where it has no more claim to one\u2019s\nattention than does any other individual. The weak impartialist\nattempts to occupy a middle ground.\n4.3 Nagel and the impersonal standpoint\n\nYet another conception of impartiality\u2014and a novel argument for\nthe rationality of altruism\u2014can be found in the work of Thomas\nNagel. In The Possibility of Altruism (1970), he seeks to\nundermine both psychological egoism, in its strong form, as defined in\n section 2.1\n above, and its normative counterpart (sometimes called\n\u201crational egoism or \u201cethical egoism\u201d), which holds\nthat one ought to have no direct concern with the good of\nothers. Indirect concern, the ethical egoist grants, can be\njustified: the good of others may be instrumental to one\u2019s own\ngood, or one might happen to have a sentimental attachment to others.\nBut absent these contingent relations to others, one has, according to\nthe ethical egoist, no reason to care about their well-being.\n\nNagel doubts that anyone actually is a psychological egoist (1970:\n84\u201385), but his major concern is to refute ethical egoism, by\nshowing that altruism is a rational requirement on action. His\nidea is not simply that we ought in certain circumstances to help\nothers for their sake; it is also that we are acting irrationally if\nwe do not. That is because it is required of us as rational beings to\nview ourselves and others from what Nagel calls \u201cthe impersonal\nstandpoint\u201d. As he puts it, \n\n\nto recognize others fully as persons requires a conception of oneself\nas identical with a particular, impersonally specifiable inhabitant of\nthe world, among others of a similar nature. (1970: 100)\n\n\nNagel likens the impersonal standpoint to the prudential policy of\nregarding all times in one\u2019s life as equal in importance. One\nhas reason not to be indifferent to one\u2019s future because the\npresent moment is not more reason-giving simply by virtue of being\npresent. Similarly, he holds, one has reason not to be indifferent to\nother people, because the fact that some individual is me is not more\nreason-giving simply because he is me. Terms like \u201cnow\u201d\nand \u201clater, \u201d \u201cme and not me\u201d point to no\ndifferences that make a rational difference. A time that is later\neventually becomes a time that is now; that is why it is arbitrary and\nirrational to discount the future simply because it is future. Giving\ngreater weight to someone\u2019s good because that person is me is no\nless irrational.\n\nThe \u201cimpersonal standpoint\u201d, as Nagel conceives it, is a\nview of the world from outside it, one that deprives one of\ninformation about which individual in that world one is. (It is, in\nthe phrase Nagel chose as the title of his 1986 book, The View\nFrom Nowhere.) From this perspective, one need not be a\nutilitarian or consequentialist\u2014one need not maximize the good,\nbut can abide by the constraints of principles of the right. But\ncertain principles are ruled out from the impersonal\nstandpoint: egoism is, as well as any other principle that gives one\nindividual or group a reason not shared by all others. For example, if\nsomeone has reason to avoid pain, that must be because\npain\u2014anyone\u2019s pain\u2014is to be avoided. So, it cannot\nbe the case that although I have a reason to avoid pain, others are\npermitted to be indifferent to my plight, as if that pain were not an\nobjectively bad thing, something that gives only the person who feels\nit a reason to oppose it. Nagel called such reasons\n\u201cobjective\u201d, as contrasted with \u201csubjective\u201d.\nParfit, in Reasons and Persons (1984), speaks instead of\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d and \u201cagent neutral\u201d reasons,\nand subsequently Nagel himself adopted these terms. The critique of\negoism in The Possibility of Altruism rests on the thesis\nthat all genuine reasons are agent neutral.\n\nWhat Nagel\u2019s position and utilitarianism have in common is a\nperspective that is the opposite of the self-centered world of\nrational egoism: from the point of view of this self-less perspective,\neach individual is just a tiny part of a vast universe of moral\nsubjects, each of no more importance or value than any other. Our\ncommon sense point of view, moving from our inner life looking\noutward, lulls us into a massive kind of insularity\u2014a tendency\nto downplay or ignore the fact that we are just one individual of no\ngreater importance than any other. We put ourselves at the center of\nour world, and this can only be corrected by stepping back, leaving\nout of our picture the particular individual one is, and making\ngeneral judgments about how human beings should behave towards each\nother. From this perspective, when one person ought to do something,\nsome related requirement is imposed on all others as well \u2013some\n\u201cought\u201d statement applies to each. \n\nNagel is faced with the problem of how to explain why self-interest is\nnot regularly swamped by agent-neutral reasons. If anyone\u2019s pain\nimposes on all other moral agents a requirement of some sort,\nthen one person\u2019s pain is everyone\u2019s problem. As Nagel\nsays in The View From Nowhere, (using the term\n\u201cobjective standpoint\u201d for the impersonal standpoint),\n\n\n\nwhen we take up the objective standpoint, the problem is not that\nvalues seem to disappear but that there are too many of them, coming\nfrom every life and drowning out those that arise from our own. (1986:\n147)\n\n\nIt would be consistent with this picture to add that the weight of\nreasons that derive from the situation of other people is extremely\nsmall and becomes increasingly so, as they are added together.\nTherefore, it might be said, they do not often outweigh reasons of\nself-interest. But that would be an ad hoc stipulation, and\nwould differ only slightly from the egoist\u2019s thesis that the\ngood of others has no independent weight. It is hard to\nbelieve that we are forced to choose between ethical egoism (which\nsays that only one\u2019s own pain ought to be one\u2019s direct\nconcern) and Nagel\u2019s conception of impartiality (according to\nwhich everyone\u2019s pain ought to weigh on me, because that of\nothers is as bad as my own). The first demands no altruism of us, the\nsecond too much.\n4.4 Sentimentalism and fellow feeling\n\nSome philosophers would say that the approaches to altruism discussed\nthus far are missing an important\u2014perhaps the most\nimportant\u2014ingredient in moral motivation. These approaches, one\nmight say, make altruism a matter of the head, but it is much more a\nmatter of the heart. The eudaimonist can say that we should have a\ncertain amount of fellow feeling, but justifies that emotional\nresponse by giving a self-interested reason for being so motivated.\nThe consequentialist seems to leave no legitimate room in our moral\nthinking for the friendly feelings and love we have for particular\nindividuals, for these sentiments are often at odds with the project\nof increasing the total amount of good in the world. The weak\nimpartialist says that in certain situations we are to be moved by the\ngood of others, but that is only because there is a moral rule,\nstriking a reasonable balance between oneself and others, that\nrequires one to do so. All three approaches\u2014so the objection\ngoes\u2014are too cold and calculating. They call upon us to treat\nothers in accordance with a formula or rule or general policy. What is\nmost important in human relationships cannot be captured by an\napproach that begins with a general rule about how to treat others,\nand justifies a certain way of treating each particular individual\nsimply by applying that general rule. \n\nIt would miss the point of this critique if one said, in response,\nthat having an emotional response to the good of others is an\neffective means of getting oneself to give them the aid they need.\n(For example, the consequentialist can say that this doctrine does\ncall upon us to act on the basis of friendly feelings and love towards\nparticular individuals, because over the long run relationships\nsolidified by such sentiments are likely to result in a greater\nbalance of good over bad than would colder relationships.) But a\ndefender of the critique put forward in the preceding paragraph would\nreply that one\u2019s emotional response to the good or ill of others\ncan be assessed as appropriate independently of the effectiveness of\none\u2019s emotions as motivators of action. When we feel compassion\nfor the suffering of a particular individual, that reaction is already\njustified; the suffering of another ought to elicit such a response\nsimply because that is the appropriate reaction. Consider, as an\nanalogy, the proper reaction to the death of a loved one; this calls\nforth grief and ought to do so, even though grief cannot undo\none\u2019s loss. In the same way, it could be said that altruistic\nfeelings are the appropriate response to the good and ill of others,\nquite apart from whether those feelings lead to results. That does not\nimply that it does not matter whether one does anything for\nthe good of others. One ought to alleviate their suffering and seek\ntheir well-being; that is because this is the proper behavioral\nexpression of one\u2019s feeling for them. If, in the face of the\nsuffering of others, one feels nothing and offers no help, the\nfundamental flaw in one\u2019s response is one\u2019s emotional\nindifference, and a secondary flaw is the failure to act that flows\nfrom that emotional defect.\n\nAccording to this \u201csentimentalist\u201d approach to altruism,\nthe question, \u201cwhy should one act for the sake of others and not\nonly for one\u2019s own sake?\u201d should not be answered by\nappealing to some notion of impartiality or some conception of\nwell-being. That would be no better than trying to justify grief by\nway of impartiality or well-being. The sentimentalist simply asks us\nto recognize that the situation of this or that human being (or\nanimal) rightly calls forth a certain emotional response, and the help\nwe give is the proper expression of that sentiment.\n5. Kant on sympathy and duty\n\nTo assess the role that sympathy should play in our relations with\nother human beings, it will be helpful to consider Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of this question in the Groundwork of the \nMetaphysics of Morals (1785). He notes that \n\n\nmany souls are so compassionately disposed that, without any further\nmotive of vanity or self-interest, they find an inner pleasure in\nspreading joy around them. (4:398) \n\n\nHe is by no means contemptuous of them\u2014on the contrary, he says\nthat they \u201cdeserve praise and encouragement\u201d (4:398). But\nnot the highest praise or the strongest encouragement. \n\nWhat they do not deserve, he says, is our \u201cesteem\u201d,\nbecause their motivation \u201chas no genuinely moral worth\u201d.\nThat is because the \u201cmaxim\u201d of what they do \u201clacks\nthe moral merit of such actions done not out of inclination but out of\nduty\u201d (4:398). Kant means that these people are not following a\nrule when they help others\u2014a rule, rationally acceptable to all,\naccording to which all those who are in such and such circumstances\nought to be helped because it is morally right to do so. (The term\n\u201csuch and such circumstances\u201d is a place-holder for a\nphrase stating in general terms what those circumstances are.) These\ncompassionate people act instead on an emotional basis: they are\npained by the misfortunes of others, and they know that if they offer\ntheir help, they will give themselves pleasure. That is a good motive,\nKant thinks, but it ought not to be one\u2019s sole or primary reason\nfor helping others.\n\nKant elaborates on his claim by imagining a transformation in one of\nthese sympathetic and compassionate people: suppose someone\u2019s\nmisfortunes have brought him sorrows that extinguish his feeling for\nothers. He retains his power to \u201cassist others in\ndistress\u201d but now \u201ctheir adversity no longer stir[s]\nhim\u201d. He feels no \u201cinclination\u201d to help them, but\ndoes so nonetheless, simply because he believes he has a moral duty to\ndo so. Kant says that when this happens, this man\u2019s character\nand his action have \u201cmoral worth\u201d\u2014whereas\nthey had none before. His motive is now \u201cincomparably the\nhighest\u201d\u2014not only is it better than before, but, because\nit is now a moral motive, it has a kind of value that takes priority\nover every other kind (4:398).\n\nWhat should we make of this? To begin with, we should acknowledge that\nif someone assists another person because he is aware of that\nperson\u2019s suffering and is distressed by it, he may not be acting\nfor the most admirable of motives. For example, if you hear someone\ncrying, and this leads you to help him, you may be motivated solely by\nyour desire for a good night\u2019s sleep, which you could not have\nhad, had he continued to cry. Alleviating his pain was not your\nultimate end \u2013it was just a way to quiet him down, so that you\ncould enjoy some peace. We might say that you \u201cdid a good\nthing\u201d, but you don\u2019t deserve any praise or admiration for\ndoing so. But this falls far short of vindicating Kant\u2019s claim.\nThis is not really a case of acting compassionately, because it was\nnot that other person\u2019s suffering you cared about\u2014only his\ncrying, and only because this distressed you.\n\nBefore we move closer to the sort of case that Kant is discussing, it\nwill be helpful to engage in a thought experiment due to Robert Nozick\n(1974: 42\u20135). He imagines an \u201cexperience machine\u201d in\nwhich a neuroscientist manipulates your brain so that you can have any\nexperiences of your choosing. Those experiences would be illusory, but\nthey could be as lifelike, rich, and complex as you choose. You might,\nfor example, enter the machine in order to have an experience exactly\nlike that of climbing Mt. Everest; you would be lying on a table with\nyour brain attached to the machine, but it would be exactly as though\nyou were facing great danger, wind, cold, snow, and so on. Nozick\nclaimed that we would not choose to plug into the machine, and rightly\nso, because there is much of value beyond the experiential component\nof our lives.\n\nWith this device in mind, let\u2019s return to Kant\u2019s\ncompassionate souls who \u201cwithout any further motive of vanity or\nself-interest, \u2026 find an inner pleasure in spreading joy around\nthem\u201d. We can offer them the opportunity to plug into the\nexperience machine, and it would then seem to them as if they were\n\u201cspreading joy around them\u201d. They would not in fact be\nhelping anyone, but it would seem to them as though they were, and\nthat would fill them with joy. Clearly, there would be little or\nnothing to admire in those who would enter the machine on these terms.\nBut what about a compassionate person who refuses this offer, and\nprefers to find joy in actually helping people\u2014not merely in\nseeming to help them? To be more precise, we might offer someone the\nfollowing choice: (a) You will experience great joy in the machine,\nimagining yourself to be helping others; (b) you will experience less\njoy outside the machine, but it will be joy taken in actually helping\nothers. A genuinely compassionate person would choose (b). He would be\ngiving up a certain amount of pleasure in order to be of use to\nothers. And there is certainly something admirable about that.\n\nAccording to Kant, however, there is still something of great worth\nthat is missing in the motivation of this genuinely compassionate\nperson, willing though he is to make some sacrifice in his own\nwell-being for the sake of others. His reason for helping is not that\nit would be morally wrong to fail to do so\u2014wrong because he\nwould be violating a moral rule that makes it a duty for him to help\nthem. What motivates him to aid others is simply that he is inclined\nto do so. If he did not take any pleasure in being of assistance, he\nwould not do so.\n\nWe should agree with Kant that there are situations in which it would\nbe morally wrong for one person to refuse to help another, whether\nthat person has fellow feeling for others or not. For example, suppose\na child needs to be taken to the hospital, and it so happens that you\ncan do so at some small cost or inconvenience to yourself. Although\nthis child is a stranger to you, you are someone who finds children\nadorable and likes to be with them. And so you willingly accompany the\nchild to the hospital. Your love of children is admirable, but you\nwould still be subject to criticism, if that were your sole motivation\nfor assisting this child. By hypothesis, in the situation we are\nimagining, it would be wrong to refuse\u2014and yet the wrongness of\nrefusing, by hypothesis, is not one of your motives.\n\nBut Kant\u2019s point is of limited application, for there are many\nother kinds of situation in which assisting others for their sake is\nadmirable but not a moral duty. Suppose, for example, a novelist takes\ntime away from her work each day in order to read to blind people in\nher community. She does not have a moral obligation to assist those\npeople; she helps them because she loves books and she wants to spread\nthe joy she takes in literature to others. Perhaps at some point in the\nfuture, her interests will change\u2014she might no longer write\nnovels, and she might get no pleasure from reading to others. She might\nthen no longer volunteer to read to the blind. Kant must say that the\nhelp given by this writer does not deserve our \u201cesteem\u201d\nand \u201chas no genuinely moral worth\u201d, because she acts from\ninclination rather than duty. But it is implausible to withhold these\nwords of praise. The author does not read to others merely as a means\nto advance her career or her own well-being. Although she enjoys\nreading to others, she may believe that it would be better for her to\nspend more of her time working on her own writing projects. She makes\nsome sacrifices because she believes that other people\u2019s lives\nwill improve if she can instill in them the joy she takes in these\nbooks. Surely her motives have \u201cmoral worth\u201d in the normal\nsense of that term: her reason for acting is to help others.\n\nRecall Kant\u2019s thought experiment in which a person full of\nsympathy and compassion suffers severe misfortunes that extinguish all\nof his feeling for others. He is still able to benefit others, and he\nstill has a strong sense of duty. Kant seems to be implying that if\nsuch an individual continues to \u201cassist others in\ndistress\u201d because he sees that he has a duty to do so, then\nthere is no moral defect in him at all. His motivation, on the\ncontrary, is exemplary, because it has \u201cmoral worth\u201d\n(unlike the motivation of the individual who is moved by inclination\nand fellow feeling). Surely Kant is right that we ought not to lower\nour opinion of him merely because he has experienced severe\nmisfortunes\u2014assuming that he did not bring them on himself. He\nsays that the adversity of others \u201cno longer stir[s]\u201d this\npoor soul, and presumably he would add that this emotional condition\nis not this unfortunate man\u2019s fault either. But even if there is\nnothing blameworthy in this man\u2019s emotional\nindifference to the good of others, it is also true that his\nrelationship with others has been damaged. He cannot respond\nto others as he should. Lacking any inclination to spread joy to\nothers, when he undertakes projects that fulfill his duty to promote\ntheir happiness or diminish their unhappiness, he will do so in a\njoyless, dutiful manner, thereby tarnishing the relationship he ought\nto have with them. If, for example, he volunteers to read to the\nblind, he will be unable to communicate to them a love of\nliterature\u2014for he himself feels no \u201cinner pleasure\u201d\nwhen he reads, and has no inclination to help others, due to his own\nsuffering. When he receives news of his adult children\u2019s\nmisfortunes, he will not respond with sympathy or\ncompassion\u2014such news will simply leave him cold (although he\nwill fulfill his parental duties, if his assistance is morally\nrequired). It would be appropriate, then, to say that this man\nexhibits significant moral defects. He lacks the motivation\nto act towards others as he should, and to feel for others as he\nshould. \n6. Sentimentalism revisited\n\nWe are now in a better position to sort through the package of ideas\nlabeled \u201csentimentalism\u201d in preceding sections, and to\nrecognize that some are far more plausible than others.\n\nFirst, we should accept the sentimentalist thesis that one\u2019s\nfeelings can be assessed as fitting or unfitting on grounds other than\ntheir causal effect on one\u2019s actions. We should, for example,\ncare about what happens to our children even when we can do nothing to\nhelp them; that emotional response is appropriate because it is part\nof what it is to be a good parent. This point allows us to concede\nthat in certain situations one ought to try to suppress an emotional\nresponse that would normally be appropriate. If one has a duty to\nminister to many people who are suffering, one may be more effective\nin aiding them if one keeps oneself from feeling the emotions that are\nfitting. A nurse working in a war zone, for example, might save more\nlives if she trains herself, for now, to feel little emotion when she\nhears the moans and cries of the wounded. She has reason to feel\ncompassion, but that is overridden by stronger reasons to act\neffectively to relieve their burden.\n\nA closely related sentimentalist point that should be accepted is that\naiding someone in need, but doing so in a manifestly cold, affectless,\nor hostile manner is, in many situations, a defective response.\n\nA second idea associated with sentimentalism in\n section 4.4\n was this: \n\n\nwhat is most important in human relationships cannot be captured by an\napproach that begins with a general rule about how to treat others,\nand justifies a certain way of treating each particular individual\nsimply by applying that general rule.\n\n\nThe kernel of truth in this statement is that some of the most\nvaluable components of our lives are not available by following a\nrule. We do not fall in love with people by applying a general\nprinciple, standard, or criterion about whom we ought to fall in love\nwith. We do not develop a passion for mathematics, or history, or\ntennis, by seeing these pursuits as specific instances of something\nmore general that we care about. Some of the most valuable components\nof our lives are available to us only if they arise spontaneously from\nfeelings that respond to the lovable features of the world or the\npeople in it.\n\nBut that leaves a great deal of room for the project of treating\npeople in accordance with rules that we accept because they survive\nour rational scrutiny. For example, it would be absurd to suggest that\nwe should abstain from torturing someone if (but only if) we have an\nuntutored and negative emotional reaction to torturing him. With\nrespect to torture, we need to respond to a general question: are\nthere circumstances in which it would be justified? (And to answer\nthat question, we must first ask: what is torture?) The only way to\naddress these questions is one in which we reason our way towards a\ngeneral policy\u2014a rule, however simple or complex, that governs\nthe use of torture. And surely such a rule should be\nimpartial\u2014it should be a single rule that applies to all, not\ntailored to serve the interests of some nations or factions to which\nwe belong.\n\nThe same point applies to questions about everyday rules that govern\nsuch acts as promise-keeping, lying, theft, and other kinds of suspect\nbehavior. Here too we rightly expect each other to have a general\npolicy, one that takes these sorts of actions to be wrong in normal\ncircumstances. That a promise has been freely made is normally a\ndecisive reason for keeping it; someone who keeps a promise only if he\nhas a positive feeling about doing so would not be treating others as\nthey rightly expect to be treated. (For opposing views, see Dancy\n2004; Ridge and McKeever 2006.)\n\nA third question about the relation between our sentiments and\naltruism arises when we ask about the proper basis for charitable\ngiving. Consider, for example, someone who donates money to an\norganization devoted to fighting cancer, and chooses to do so because\nhis mother has died of cancer. His gift is an expression of his love\nfor her; it is meant, of course, to do good to others, but those\nothers are chosen as beneficiaries because he takes the reduction of\nthis disease to be an appropriate expression of his feelings for her.\nUtilitarianism cannot easily accept this form of altruism, since it\nbegins with the premise that charitable acts, like everything else,\nare right only if they do the most good\u2014and it could easily be\nthe case that money allocated to cancer research would do more good if\ndonated to some other humanitarian cause. But if one does not\npresuppose the truth of utilitarianism, it is not difficult to defend\nthe practice of choosing one charity over another on the basis of\none\u2019s sentimental attachments. If friendships and other loving\nrelationships have a proper place in our lives even if they do not\nmaximize the good, then sentiment is an appropriate basis for\naltruism. (For an opposing view, see Singer 2015.)\n\nThat does not entail that it is always right to follow our feelings\nwhen we decide whether to help this person or organization rather than\nthat. Suppose you belong to a group dedicated to reducing the number\nof people who die in drowning accidents, and you are on your way to an\nessential meeting of this organization. If you miss the meeting, let\nus suppose, the group will have to suspend its operations for many\nmonths\u2014with the result that the number of drownings will remain\nhigh. On your way, you pass a child who is in danger of drowning, and\ncries for your help. You must choose: either you can save this one\nchild, or you can attend the meeting and thereby save many more from\ndrowning. When you hear the child\u2019s cries for help, you cannot\nhelp responding emotionally; it would be cold and calculating to pass him\nby, even if in doing so you will be saving many more. What ought you\nto do?\n\nThe fact that your emotions are fully aroused by the child\u2019s\ncries does not have the same bearing on this issue as does the love\nfelt by a son for his departed mother in the previous example. The\ndrowning child whose cries fill you with compassionate feeling is a\nstranger to you. So your alternatives in this case are whether to help\none stranger (the one who is tugging at your heartstrings) or many\n(whom you do not see or hear at the moment). It would not be\nimplausible to hold that sentiment plays an appropriate role in\naltruism when it is the expression of a long-term and meaningful bond,\nbut not when it is a short-lived reaction to the cries of a\nstranger.\n7. Conclusion\n\nWe have found no reason to doubt that we both can and should be\naltruistic to some extent. To what extent? Utilitarians and\nconsequentialists have an exact answer to that question: one is to\ngive equal weight to the good of every human being (or every sentient\ncreature), counting oneself as just one small part of that universal\ngood. If that is more altruism than can be required of us, the better\nalternative is not to retreat to the other extreme (egoism). Rather,\nhow much altruism is appropriate for an individual varies according to\nthat individual\u2019s situation in life.\n\nAltruism is not necessarily admirable. It is to be admired only in\ncircumstances in which it is appropriate to act for another\u2019s\nsake\u2014and only when what one aims to do for another really does\nbenefit that individual. If one seeks what one takes to be the good of\nothers for their sake, but is mistaken about what is really good for\nthem, one\u2019s action is defective. Altruism is fully admirable\nonly when combined with a correct understanding of well-being.\n\nWhat is wrong with those who do not care about others for their sake?\nIt could be the case that such individuals are themselves worse off\nfor their lack of altruistic motivation. That is what a eudaimonist\nmust say, and we have not objected to that aspect of eudaimonism. It\ncould also be the case that there is a failure of rationality among\nthose who are never altruistic or insufficiently altruistic. But it\nshould not be assumed that there must be something else that goes awry\nin those who are not altruistic or not altruistic enough, beyond the\nfact that when they ought to have cared about some individual other\nthan themselves, they failed to do so.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Annas, J., 1993, <em>The Morality of Happiness</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, translated with\nintroduction and notes by C.D.C.
