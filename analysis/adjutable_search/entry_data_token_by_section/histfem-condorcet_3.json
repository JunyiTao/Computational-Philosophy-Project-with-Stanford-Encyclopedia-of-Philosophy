    "main_text": "The Rights of Women\n4. The Rights of Women\n\nCondorcet\u2019s most extensive arguments on women\u2019s rights appear in two\nessays. The first was authored in 1787, prior to the Revolution; the\nsecond, published in 1790 in the Journal of the Society of\n1789, was composed in the context of a debate over the\nappropriate constitutional arrangements for the new French nation. In\naddition, commitment to women\u2019s rights informs his Testament\nto his daughter, and is not forgotten in the section of the\nEsquisse known as the Fragment sur l\u2019Atlantide\n[Fragment on the New Atlantis], where he restates his objection to\nusing allegations about physical or intellectual inferiority to\njustify political exclusion (see Fricheau, 1989). In his 1791\nMemoirs on Public Instruction, he demands that public\neducation be open to women and men, and that women not be excluded\nfrom any curriculum, including science (see Condorcet 1791 web\nresource; Kintzler 1984; and Didier 1989 on the strong links between\nCondorcet\u2019s views on education and on women\u2019s equality and\nrights). Whereas the eighteenth century has been famously\ncharacterized as \u201cthe age of woman\u201d\u2014owing, in large\nmeasure, to its depiction during the nineteenth century by the\nGoncourt\n brothers[15]\u2014for\n the most part, neither the philosophes nor their most\nintellectually distinguished female contemporaries (in France, Madame\nde Lambert, Madame du Ch\u00e2telet, Madame de Graffigny, Madame\nRiccoboni, Madame de Lambert, Julie de Lespinasse, and Madame de\nGenlis; in Italy, the University of Bologna professor of mathematics,\nFran\u00e7oise Agnesi and professor of anatomy Laura Bassi)\naddressed the question of women\u2019s rights with the same clarity,\ndirectness or force as Condorcet. Moreover, enlightened claims about\nnatural human equality were tempered by entrenched assumptions about\ncomplementary male and female sex-specific attributes, which provided\nammunition for the delayed expansion of women\u2019 civil and political\nrights in modern times. As Steinbr\u00fcgge (1995, 4) proposes, the\neighteenth-century \u201cis the age that saw the emergence of an\nimage of female nature that allowed precisely these exclusions to be\nconsidered \u2018natural\u2019\u201d. Thus, the defenders of\nwomen\u2019s rights during the \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d were\nfaced with the problem that the denial of women\u2019s equality was couched\nin secular not religious considerations and buttressed by\npseudo-scientific claims.\n\nYet Condorcet never abandoned science in his support for women\u2019s\nrights; nor did he see scientific claims as a barrier to greater\nequality (Ansart [2009] further proposes a connection between his\nfeminism and his pioneering effort to apply mathematics to social\ninvestigation). Moreover, he anchored his defense in a counter-strain\nwithin enlightened thought that dates back to the early 1670s when the\nex-theologian and disciple of Descartes Poulain de la Barre challenged\nmale supremacy and advocated gender and racial equality (see Poulain\nde la Barre 2002; Stuurman 2004). As against the philosophical\nanthropology that held sway with so many philosophes, Poulain\nand other contributors to what is known as the \u201cquerelle des\nfemmes\u201d offered a rationalist alternative to standard\nmisogynistic positions, which pointed not to the body but the\n mind.[16]\n It is to this rationalist tradition that Condorcet is indebted.\nHowever, Condorcet\u2019s consideration of women\u2019s rights is especially\nnoteworthy given the paucity of discussion of women\u2019s rights within\nenlightened circles as well as the absence of any organized campaign\nfor women\u2019s rights in France (or elsewhere) in the years immediately\nleading up to 1789. As the philosopher was well aware, there also\nexisted what he referred to as the comfortable habits of mind by which\nwomen were regarded as second-class citizens. Moreover, Condorcet not\nonly expanded upon Poulain\u2019s earlier contribution but his 1787 and\n1790 arguments boldly anticipated and reinforced the position taken by\nthose relatively few who dared to demand rights for women during the\nRevolution and with increasing numbers, and ultimately more\nsuccessfully, made the same demands in the following centuries (On\nenlightened male thinkers who discussed women\u2019s condition, see Brookes\n1980; Landes 1988; Pappas 1991; Nall 2008 and 2010. \n",
