    "main_text": "Influences on al-Kindi || Greek influences\n2.1 Greek influences\n\n\nAs one would expect given his prominent role in the translation\nmovement, al-Kindi\u2019s works are suffused with ideas from Greek\nthought. His philosophical works are indebted in part to the\nmathematical and scientific authors translated by his day, for\ninstance Nicomachus of Gerasa; Euclid influenced his methodology as\nwell as his mathematics (cf. Gutas 2004). But the most important\ninfluence on his philosophy was from Aristotle, whose corpus al-Kindi\nsurveys in a treatise called On the Quantity of Aristotle\u2019s\nBooks (Abu Rida 1950, 363\u201384; also Guidi and Walzer 1940,\nCortabarria Beitia 1972, Jolivet 2004, Ighbariah 2012). This work provides a fairly\nthorough overview of Aristotle\u2019s corpus, though al-Kindi clearly has\nnot read some of the treatises he discusses. When al-Kindi comes to\nmention the contents of the Metaphysics he gives the\nfollowing, rather surprising, summary:\n\n\nHis purpose in his book called Metaphysics is to explain\nthings that subsist without matter and, though they may exist together\nwith what does have matter, are neither connected nor united to matter;\nto affirm the oneness of God, the great and exalted, to explain His\nbeautiful names, and that He is the agent cause of the universe, which\nperfects [all things], the God of the universe who governs through His\nperfect providence and complete wisdom.\n\n\nWhile this may not look like an accurate description of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, it is a wholly accurate description of\nal-Kindi\u2019s own conception of the science of metaphysics. That he\nconflates metaphysics with theology is clear from the opening of\nOn First Philosophy, which says that since philosophy in\ngeneral is the study of truth, \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d is\n\u201cthe knowledge of the first truth who is the cause of all\ntruth.\u201d And indeed Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics is a major\ninfluence on this work. However, as is typical of al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical writings, On First Philosophy also makes\nextensive use of ideas from translations of Neoplatonic writings. The\nproof for the existence of a \u201ctrue One\u201d is based in part\non Proclus (as shown in Jolivet 1979), and one can detect influences\nfrom the Arabic version of Plotinus produced in al-Kindi\u2019s circle, the\nso-called Theology of Aristotle. Perhaps the most important\nsingle influence, however, is an attack on Aristotle by the\nNeoplatonist Christian thinker John Philoponus, over the issue of the\nworld\u2019s eternity.\n\nOn First Philosophy, then, is a particularly good example of\nhow al-Kindi combines Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ideas in his vision\nof a coherent philosophy derived from the Greeks. The way for this\nsynoptic conception of the Greek inheritance had actually been prepared\nby the Neoplatonists themselves, whose commentaries on Aristotle\npresage the harmonizing tendencies obvious in al-Kindi. But as a\npromoter of Greek wisdom, al-Kindi would in any case have been eager to\ndeemphasize any tensions between Greek philosophers, or any failings on\nthe part of Greek thinkers. For example he gives no sign that his\nposition on the eternity of the world departs from that of Aristotle.\n(Interestingly he is more willing to recognize shortcomings on the part\nof Greek scientific thinkers, for instance in Euclid\u2019s optics,\nthough even here he emphasizes the need for a charitable approach.)\nLater in the first section of On First Philosophy, al-Kindi\nunleashes a torrent of abuse against unnamed contemporaries who\ncriticize the use of Greek ideas:\n\n\nWe must not be ashamed to admire the truth or to acquire it, from\nwherever it comes. Even if it should come from far-flung nations and\nforeign peoples, there is for the student of truth nothing more\nimportant than the truth, nor is the truth demeaned or diminished by\nthe one who states or conveys it; no one is demeaned by the truth,\nrather all are ennobled by it.\n\n\nAlthough al-Kindi was unyielding in his support for the ideas\ndisseminated in the translation project, he was inevitably influenced\nby the intellectual currents of his day. This comes out most clearly\nwhen al-Kindi uses Greek ideas to engage with the problems of his time,\nespecially in the arena of theology.\n",
