    "main_text": "Arnauld\u2019s Cartesianism || Mind-body dualism\n3.3 Mind-body dualism\n\nIf there is one part of Descartes\u2019 philosophy that met with\nArnauld\u2019s enthusiastic approval, it is Descartes\u2019\nmind-body dualism. Yet even here Arnauld\u2019s version of the\nCartesian philosophy departed in important ways from Descartes\u2019\nown views. Arnauld\u2019s departure did not have to do with the\ndistinction between mind and body; here he largely contents himself\nwith endorsing what Descartes\n says.[8]\n It had to do rather with the union of the mind and body in a human\nbeing. Arnauld rejected a claim at the core of Descartes\u2019\nposition, namely, that the union of a person\u2019s mind and body\nmakes it possible for the mind and the body to exercise real causal\naction on one another. Arnauld explicitly says that a person\u2019s\nbody cannot act causally on his mind, and had at least some difficulty\nwith the notion that a person\u2019s mind can act causally on his\nbody.\n\nIn 1680 Arnauld wrote an extended defense of the \u201cthe philosophy\nof Descartes\u201d regarding \u201cthe essence of body and the union\nof the soul with the body,\u201d against an attack by Fr. Etienne Le\n Moine.[9]\n Throughout this work, Arnauld quotes Malebranche as representative of\nthe Cartesian position, and what he defends under the heading,\n\u201cthe philosophy of Descartes,\u201d is actually a modified\nversion of\n Malebranche.[10]\n According to the Cartesian philosophy, says Arnauld,\n\nAll the union (alliance) of the mind and the body which is\nknown to us consists in a natural and mutual correspondence of\nthoughts in the soul with traces in the brain and of emotions in the\nsoul with movements of the [animal] spirits.\u2026 It is not denied\nthat there may be something unknown to us in the union God has brought\nabout between our soul and our body (Examen, OA,\n38:141).\n\n\nwhat we do know, however, suffices to show that the mind is not\nrelated to the body as a pilot to his ship, but rather that the two\nare united in \u201ca greater and more intimate union\u201d by which\nthey form a single whole (Examen, OA, 38:141).\n\nArnauld next takes up a criticism directed by Le Moine against the\nCartesian account of sense perception, and this leads to the\nquestion,\n\nwhether it is the bodily movements [in the eye] that cause the\nperceptions in the soul; or whether they are only the occasion on\nwhich the soul forms [the perceptions] in itself; or whether God gives\n[the perceptions] to [the soul](Examen, OA, 38:146).\n\n\nArnauld says that it is \u201ceasy\u201d to eliminate the first\nalternative: \u201cFor since the motion of a body can at best have no\nother effect than to move another body (I say at best because\nit may have not even that), who does not see that it can have no\neffect on a spiritual soul?\u201d (Examen, OA,\n38:146). He adds that St. Augustine considered it beyond doubt that a\nbody can have an effect only on our body, and not on our soul. Arnauld\nrules out the second of his three alternatives on the grounds that the\nsoul cannot form sensible perceptions in itself on the occasion of\nparticular motions in the bodily sensory apparatus because the soul is\nnot aware of those motions (Examen, OA, 38: 147).\nThis leaves Arnauld with the third alternative, which he accepts,\nadding that God voluntarily undertakes to cause in our soul\nperceptions of sensible qualities whenever the corresponding motions\noccur in the sensory organs \u201caccording to the laws He himself\nhas established in nature\u201d (Examen, OA,\n38:148). He summarizes this conclusion by saying that our body does\nnot act on our soul as a \u201cphysical cause (cause\nphysique)\u201d but only as a \u201cmoral cause (cause\nmorale)\u201d (Examen, OA, 38:150).\n\nArnauld had a quite different position regarding the causation of\nvoluntary movements in the body. He held that, in general, it is\npossible for immaterial, thinking beings to act causally on material\nthings, and that, in fact, God has on occasion given angels the power\nto do so. He also held that the mind of Adam and of Eve had the power\nto bring about voluntary motions in their bodies before the Fall, and\nthat the minds of the blessed in heaven will enjoy that power. He\nsuggests that the voluntary bodily motions of human beings in this\nlife here below are not caused by the person\u2019s volitions. His\nreason for this negative position is that post-lapsarian human beings\ndo not know how to bring about the movements of the animal spirits\nthat cause the motions of their muscles and limbs. Thus he says,\n\nIf one can say [that God has not given our soul a real power\nto determine the course of the animal spirits toward the muscles of\nthe parts of our body that we want to move], it is not [on the grounds\nof a general occasionalism like Malebranche\u2019s]\u2026 It is\nonly because our soul does not know what must be done in order to move\nour arm by means of the animal spirits (emphasis added;\nDissertation sur les Miracles de l\u2019ancienne loi,\nOA, 38:690).\n\n\nSteven Nadler cites this text while arguing that Arnauld was an\n\u201coccasionalist\u201d both about the causation of sensory\nperceptions by bodies, and about the causation of voluntary movements\nby the human mind (Nadler 1995, 138). Nadler recognizes that Arnauld\nhad quite different attitudes toward the two cases, but nevertheless\nsays that Arnauld \u201calone among Cartesians\u201d recognized\nmind-body interaction as a specific problem in Descartes\u2019\nmetaphysics, and \u201cused an occasionalist solution\u201d (Nadler\n1995, 144).\n\nArnauld\u2019s treatment of the union of mind and body shows that he\nwas not a docile follower of Descartes, and was prepared to develop\n\u201cthe philosophy of Descartes\u201d in ways that Descartes would\nprobably not have accepted. It also shows that Arnauld was prepared to\nmodify Descartes\u2019 philosophy in a way that increased its\nsimilarity to Augustine. It is well known that Arnauld pointed out\nsimilarities between Augustine and Descartes from the beginning of his\npublished work, in the \u201cFourth Objections.\u201d In the present\ncase, however, Arnauld changes the philosophy of Descartes in a way\nthat increases its similarity to Augustine. Arnauld did not mention\nAquinas, though he could have done so, as another authority who held\nthat a material thing cannot produce an immaterial effect. It was only\na few years later, in Ideas, that Arnauld began to claim an\naffinity between the views of Descartes and those of Aquinas. But in\nhis development of the Cartesian position on the union of mind and\nbody, one can already see Arnauld attempting to make of Descartes a\nChristian philosopher standing in continuity with his great patristic\nand scholastic predecessors. (This attempt on Arnauld\u2019s part is\nexplored in the journal Dix-Septieme Sciecle, 2013/2 no.\n259.)\n",
