Taxonomic Representation and Reasoning\n10.1 Concept-Based Classification\n\n\nTraditionally, the task of representing large amounts of domain\ninformation for general-purpose reasoning has been one of the most\nimportant areas of knowledge representation. Systems that exploit the\nintuitive taxonomic organization of domains are useful for this\npurpose; taxonomic hierarchies not only help to organize the process of\nknowledge acquisition, but provide a useful connection to rule-based\nreasoning.[41]\n\n\nFor domains in which complex definitions are a natural way to\norganize information, knowledge engineering services based on\ndefinitions of concepts have been extremely successful. Like\nvariable-free versions of first-order logic (see, for instance,\n Quine 1960,\n these systems are centered on\nconcepts or first-order predicates, and provide a number of mechanisms\nfor their definition. The fundamental algorithm associated with these\ntaxonomic logics is a classifier which inputs a system of\ndefinitions and outputs the entailment relations between defined and\nprimitive concepts. For background on these systems, see\n Woods & Schmolze 1992\n and\n Brachman et al. 1991.\n\n\nThe simplest taxonomic logics can be regarded as subsystems of\nfirst-order logic with complex predicates; but they have been extended\nin many ways, and the issues raised by many of these extensions overlap\nin many cases with topics in philosophical logic.\n10.2 Nonmonotonic Inheritance\n\n\nMuch more complex logical issues arise when the organization of a\ndomain into hierarchies is allowed to have exceptions. One way to\napproach this topic is to explore how to make a taxonomic logic\nnonmonotonic; but nonmonotonic inheritance is a topic in its\nown right. Although there are strong affinities to nonmonotonic logic,\nnonmonotonic logic relies more heavily on graph-based representations\nthan on traditional logical ideas, and seems to provide a much\nfiner-grained approach to nonmonotonic reasoning that raises entirely\nnew issues, and which quickly becomes problematic. For this reason,\nsystems of nonmonotonic inheritance tend to be expressively weak, and\ntheir relations to the more powerful nonmonotonic logic has never been\nfully clarified. For background on this topic, see\n Thomason 1992,\n Horty 1994.\n",
