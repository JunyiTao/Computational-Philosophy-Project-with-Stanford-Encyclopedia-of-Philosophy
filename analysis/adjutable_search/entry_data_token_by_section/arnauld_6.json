    "main_text": "Arnauld and Malebranche\n4. Arnauld and Malebranche\n\nNicolas Malebranche was born in 1638, when Arnauld was twenty-six\nyears old. In 1660, Malebranche joined the Oratory, a center for\npriests in Paris that had many connections with Port-Royal.\nMalebranche and Arnauld were on friendly terms in the early 1670s, but\nlate in the decade they had a falling out over Malebranche\u2019s\nexplanation of the fact that not all men are saved, and related\n matters.[15]\n In 1680, Malebranche published his position, against Arnauld\u2019s\nadvice, in the Treatise of Nature and Grace (hereinafter\nTNG). The ensuing public controversy between the two was a\ncentral event in the intellectual life of Europe in the late\nseventeenth century.\n\nArnauld\u2019s attack on TNG began in a surprising way, with\nthe publication of On True and False Ideas (hereinafter\nIdeas) in 1683. In it, Arnauld presents his own position on\nthe nature of ideas, which was described above, and argues that\nMalebranche\u2019s view that we see all things (or at least all\nbodily things) in God and by means of God\u2019s ideas is not only\nmistaken, but thoroughly confused and wrong-headed. This work\nengendered a preliminary debate that lasted for two years. The\npublication of R\u00e9flexions in 1685\u201386, preceded\nin 1685 by the publication of Arnauld\u2019s Dissertation sur les\nmiracles de l\u2019ancien loi, provoked further exchanges\nbetween the two in 1687, with a last gasp on Arnauld\u2019s part in\n1694, the year of his death, and on Malebranche\u2019s part ten years\nlater, in\n 1704.[16]\n",
