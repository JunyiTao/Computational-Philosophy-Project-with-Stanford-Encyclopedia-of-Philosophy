    "main_text": "Reasoning about Knowledge\n7. Reasoning about Knowledge\n\n\nEpistemic logic is another area in which logic in computer science\nhave been influenced by philosophical logic. The classical source for\nepistemic logic is\n Hintikka 1962,\n in which Jaakko Hintikka\nshowed that a modal approach to single-agent epistemic attitudes could\nbe informative and rewarding. This work discusses at length the\nquestion of exactly which constraints are appropriate for knowledge and\nbelief, when these attitudes are viewed as explicated by a model\ntheoretic relation over possible worlds; in both cases, Hintikka argues\nfor S4 type operators. \n\n\nIn several papers (including\n McCarthy 1979),\n John McCarthy has recommended an approach to formalizing\nknowledge that uses first-order logic, but that quantifies explicitly\nover such things as individual concepts. In this section, we discuss\nthe approach taken by most computer scientists, who, unlike McCarthy,\nuse a modal language to formalize propositional attitudes.\n\n\nThe logical aspects of modal epistemic logic were not significantly\ndeveloped after Hintikka\u2019s 1962 presentation; instead, the\nphilosophical literature (which is not extensive, compared with many\nother topics in the area) concentrates on the issue of\nhyperintensionality, or closure of epistemic attitudes under\nlogical consequence. This topic is especially challenging, turning out\nto be closely related to the semantic paradoxes, and the philosophical\nliterature is inconclusive. Intuitions seem to conflict, and it is\ndifficult to find ways to model the important phenomena using logical\ntechniques.[35]\n\nFagin et al. 1984\n begins a\ntradition in computational logic that revives the modal approach to\nepistemic logic, developing generalized logical foundations and\napplications that had not occurred to the philosophers. The technical\nidea is to simplify the modality, using S5 (or deontic\nS5 for belief), but to introduce multiple agents, and\nto concentrate on reasoning having to do with agents\u2019 attitudes about\none another\u2019s attitudes. Such logics have direct applications in the\nanalysis of distributed systems, dynamic systems in which\nchange is effected by message actions, which change the knowledge of\nagents according to rules determined by a communications\nprotocol.\n\n\nAs such, this work belongs to a separate area of computer science,\nbut one that overlaps to some extent with AI. Later, this work has\ninteracted with a research tradition in economics that is concerned\nwith the role of knowledge in games and bargaining; see, for\n instance,\n Geanakopolos 1994;\n Osborne & Rubenstein 1994\n[Chapter\u00a05].\n\n\nFor some reason, the multi-agent case did not occur to philosophical\nlogicians.[36]\n This is another example of the way\nin which need for an application (in this case, the need for a theory\nof distributed systems) provided the inspiration for an important\nlogical development. The logical details are extensively and systematically \nrecorded in\n Fagin et al. 1995;\n this is\nessential reading for anyone seriously interested in this topic.\n\n\nMuch of the interdisciplinary work in applications of the logic of\nknowledge is reported in the proceedings of a series of conferences\ninitiated in 1986 with\n Halpern 1986.\n These\nconferences record one of the most successful collaborations of\nphilosophers with logicians in Computer Science, although the group of\ninvolved philosophers has been relatively small. The focus of the\nconferences has gradually shifted from Computer Science to\nEconomics.\n\n\nAI applications deal with with knowledge in the form of stored\nrepresentations, and the tradition in AI with which we are concerned\nhere thinks of reasoning as the manipulation of symbolic\nrepresentations. Also, it is mainly due to AI that the problem of\nlimited rationality has become a topic of serious interest, providing a\ncounterbalance to the idealizations of philosophy and\neconomics.[37]\n So you would think that a logical\nmodel of propositional attitudes that is committed to closure under\nlogical consequence would be highly unpopular in AI. But this is not\nso; the possible worlds approach to attitudes is not only the leading\ntheory in the areas discussed in\n Fagin et al. 1995,\n but has even been advocated in robotics\napplications; see\n Rosenschein & Kaelbling 1995;\n Rosenschein 1989.\n Nevertheless, the issue of hyperintensionality has been\ninvestigated in the AI literature; see\n Perlis 1985;\n Konolige 1986;\n Lakemeyer 1997;\n Levesque 1984).\n Though there are some new\npositive results here, the AI work in this area has, for the most\npart, been as inconclusive as that in philosophy.\n\n\nThe philosophical literature on a related topic, the logic of\nperception, has not been extensive; the main reference is\n Hintikka 1970.[38]\n But sensation is\naddressed in recent work in the AI literature which is concerned with\ndeveloping logical frameworks for general-purpose applications in\nrobotics. The main idea in this area is to add sensing actions to the\nrepertoire of a planning formalism of the sort discussed in\n Section 4.\n The earliest work in this area was carried\nout in the 1980s by Robert Moore; see\n Moore 1995b;\n Moore 1985.\n For some of the\ncontemporary work in cognitive robotics, see\n Baral et al. 2000,\n Bacchus et al. 1999,\n Golden & Weld, 1996,\n Pirri & Finzi 1999,\n and\n Thielscher 2000.\n",
