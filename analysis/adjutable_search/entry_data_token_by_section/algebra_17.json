    "main_text": "Algebraization of mathematics || Algebraic geometry\n5.1 Algebraic geometry\n\nAlgebraic geometry begins with what we referred to in the introduction\nas shapes, for example lines \\(y = ax +b\\), circles \\(x^2 +y^2 =\nr^2\\), spheres \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2 = r^2\\), conic sections \\(f(x, y) = 0\\)\nwhere \\(f\\) is a quadratic polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), quadric\nsurfaces \\(f(x, y, z) = 0\\) with \\(f\\) again quadratic, and so on.\n\nIt is convenient to collect the two sides of these equations on the\nleft so that the right side is always zero. We may then define a shape\nor variety to consist of the roots or zeros of a\npolynomial, or more generally the common zeros of a set of\npolynomials.\n\nOrdinary analytical or Cartesian geometry is conducted over the reals.\nAlgebraic geometry is more commonly conducted over the complex\nnumbers, or more generally over any algebraically closed field. The\nvarieties definable in this way are called affine\nvarieties.\n\nSometimes however algebraic closure is not desirable, for example when\nworking at the boundary of algebraic geometry and number theory where\nthe field may be finite, or the rationals.\n\nMany kinds of objects are characterized by what structure their maps\nhold invariant. Posets transform via monotone functions, leaving order\ninvariant. Algebras transform via homomorphisms, leaving the algebraic\nstructure invariant. In algebraic geometry varieties transform via\nregular \\(n\\)-ary functions \\(f: A^n \\rightarrow\nA\\), defined as functions that are locally rational polynomials in\n\\(n\\) variables. Locally rational means that at each point of the\ndomain of \\(f\\) there exists a neighborhood on which \\(f\\) is the\nratio of two polynomials, the denominator of which is nonzero in that\nneighborhood.\n\nThis notion generalizes to regular functions \\(f: A^n \\rightarrow\nA^m\\) defined as \\(m\\)-tuples of regular \\(n\\)-ary functions.\n\nGiven two varieties \\(V, V'\\) in \\(A^n\\) and \\(A^m\\) respectively, a\nregular function from \\(A^n\\) to \\(A^m\\) whose restriction to \\(V\\) is\na function from \\(V\\) to \\(V'\\) is called a regular function of\nvarieties. The category of affine varieties is then defined to\nhave as its objects all affine varieties and as its morphisms all\nregular functions thereof.\n\nPolynomials being continuous, one would expect regular functions\nbetween varieties to be continuous also. A difficulty arises with the\nshapes of varieties, where there can be cusps, crossings, and other\nsymptoms of singularity. What is needed here is a suitable topology by\nwhich to judge continuity.\n\nThe trick is to work not in affine space but its projective\nspace. To illustrate with Euclidean three-space, its associated\nprojective space is the unit sphere with antipodal points identified,\nforming a two-dimensional manifold. Equivalently this is the space of\nall (unoriented) lines through the origin. Given an arbitrary affine\nspace, its associated projective space is the space of all such lines,\nunderstood as a manifold.\n\nThe topology on projective space appropriate for algebraic geometry is\nthe Zariski topology, defined not by its open sets but rather\nby its closed sets, which are taken to be the algebraic sets, namely\nthose sets constituting the common zeros of a set of homogeneous\npolynomials. The crucial theorem is then that regular maps between\naffine varieties are continuous with respect to the Zariski\ntopology.\n",
