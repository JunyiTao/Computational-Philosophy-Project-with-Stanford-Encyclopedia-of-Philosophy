    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nStrauss was born on September 20, 1899 in Kirchhain, a small, rural\ntown in Germany. He was raised in an orthodox Jewish home and also\nstudied at a Gymnasium in nearby Marburg where he received a broad\nhumanistic education. At the age of seventeen Strauss became a devoted\nadvocate of political Zionism. He spent a year in Belgium as an\ninterpreter for the military after which he began his studies at the\nUniversity of Marburg, where the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher,\nHermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) had established a thriving school of\nneo-Kantianism. In 1921, Strauss completed his dissertation,\n\u201cThe problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of F.H.\nJacobi,\u201d under the direction of Cohen\u2019s student, Ernst\nCassirer (1874\u20131945). Strauss\u2019s dissertation considered\nthe implications of Jacobi\u2019s notion of revelation for the\nproblem of knowledge. Although Strauss would come to regard his\ndissertation as \u201ca disgraceful performance,\u201d the question\nof the meaning and status of divine revelation would continue to\noccupy him throughout his life.\n\nStrauss spent 1922 in Freiburg where he attended Edmund\nHusserl\u2019s lectures on phenomenology. Like a number of others,\nwho would soon become famous philosophers in their own right, such as\nEmmanuel Levinas, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Karl L\u00f6with, and Hannah\nArendt, Strauss was quickly taken with Husserl\u2019s student, Martin\nHeidegger, who, he later wrote, impressed him as no other contemporary\nthinker had. The following year Strauss began lecturing in Frankfurt\nunder the auspices of a center for adult education, the Freies\nJ\u00fcdische Lehrhaus, founded by Franz Rosenzweig\n(1886\u20131929). In 1925, Julius Guttmann (1880\u20131950) invited\nStrauss to Berlin to edit the jubilee edition of Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s work for the Academy of the Science of Judaism. In\n1930, Strauss published his first book, Spinoza\u2019s Critique\nof Religion, dedicated to Rosenzweig\u2019s memory, in which he\nargued that nineteenth and twentieth-century readers of Spinoza could\nsee him as a \u201cGod intoxicated man\u201d only because they had\nceased to take the possibility of divine revelation seriously.\n\nIn 1932, Strauss wrote a review of Carl Schmitt\u2019s recently\npublished book The Concept of the Political, in which he\nargued that, despite Schmitt\u2019s attempts to do otherwise, Schmitt\nstill remained within the horizon of modern liberalism because he was\nunable to offer reasons for his normative commitment to what he called\n\u201cthe political.\u201d Many of Strauss\u2019s subsequent\ncritics have interpreted his claim that Schmitt remained a liberal as\nproof of what they consider Strauss\u2019s anti-liberal ire. However,\nStrauss\u2019s critique of Schmitt is perhaps better understood as\nevidence of what would be Strauss\u2019s life long worry about modern\nliberalism\u2019s ability to justify its normative commitment to\nliberal ideals in the face of moral skepticism, relativism and what\nStrauss also called \u201cphilistinism,\u201d all of which say \u201cin effect that\none does not have to think about the reasons why those things [of\nliberalism] are good\u201d (WPP, 21). If the modern liberal state is\nimpartial to questions of value, how then does the liberal state\njustify its own value? Schmitt would state that no one had understood\nhim as Strauss had, and Strauss would later claim that reading Schmitt\nchanged his own orientation toward the question of the relation\nbetween philosophy and politics.\n\nIn 1932, due to the financial problems of the Academy for the Science\nof Judaism, Strauss found himself without a job. With a letter of\nrecommendation from Schmitt, he received a fellowship from the\nRockefeller Foundation to begin work, in France, on a study of Hobbes.\nIn Paris, Strauss attended seminars on Hegel led by Alexandre\nKoyr\u00e9 (1892\u20131964) and Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\n(1902\u20131968). The next year, he received an extension on his\nRockefeller grant to work in London and Cambridge on his book on\nHobbes.\n\nStrauss\u2019s work on Hobbes coincided with Hitler\u2019s rise to\npower. Strauss thus turned his attention to Hobbes, whom he took to be\nthe founding theorist of the liberal state, just as the idea of the\nGerman liberal state seemed to be collapsing. Strauss\u2019s third\nbook, The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its\nGenesis was published in 1936. Linking his newly found attention\nto the relation between philosophy and politics with his previous work\non what he regarded as Spinoza\u2019s critique of religion, the book\nconcerns what Strauss claimed was the intimate tie between modern\nliberalism and its critique of religion.\n\nIn 1935 Strauss had published his second book, Philosophy and Law:\nContributions to the Understanding of Maimonides and his\nPredecessors. Here too the political realities within which he\nwas living overlapped with his scholarly pursuits. At the urging of\nGershom Scholem, Strauss turned three separate essays on Maimonides\ninto a book. Scholem and Strauss hoped that the publication of\nPhilosophy and Law would help Strauss to get a position in\nmedieval Jewish philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nStrauss did not receive the position, which went instead to Julius\nGuttmann, Strauss\u2019s supervisor at the Academy for the Science of\nJudaism and a primary target of critique in Philosophy and\nLaw.\n\nMuch of Philosophy and Law is an attack on Guttmann\u2019s\nassumption that the central problem for medieval Jewish philosophy was\nepistemological in nature. According to Guttmann, the fundamental\nquestion in studying medieval Jewish philosophy was how medieval\nJewish philosophers, and Maimonides in particular, understood the\nrelation between reason and revelation as sources of knowledge.\nStrauss argued, in contrast, that Maimonides\u2019 basic concern was\nnot epistemological but instead political. Before any questions about\nthe basis of knowledge can be asked, the question of what it means to\nphilosophize in the framework of the authority of the law must be\nanswered. Strauss argued that philosophy can clarify the meaning of\nthe law, but philosophy cannot derive the law itself. Instead, the law\nis the pre-philosophical context of and framework for philosophy. It\nwas also within the context of Philosophy and Law that\nStrauss began to consider something he had up until then thought\nimpossible: a return to pre-modern philosophy.\n\nIn 1937 Strauss accepted a visiting lectureship in history from\nColumbia University. The following year Strauss became a visiting\nresearcher at the New School for Social Research, home to many\nEuropean \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Strauss\u2019s position at the New\nSchool became permanent, and he remained there for ten years.\n\nThe decade that Strauss spent at the New School was arguably the most\nproductive, and certainly the most pivotal, of his intellectual\ncareer. In his first years at the New School, Strauss published the\nseminal essays that would become the book Persecution and the Art\nof Writing, published in 1952. In these essays, Strauss argued\nthat, when reading certain pre-modern thinkers, it is necessary to\nread between the lines. The possibility of persecution gives rise to a\ncertain type of writing that allows one set of the readers, the\nmajority, to receive one message while allowing a second set of\nreaders, the philosophical elite, to take away another message. While\nthis type of writing is often referred to as \u201cesoteric,\u201d\nit is more properly understood as \u201cexoteric,\u201d that is,\nwriting that outwardly veils a secret teaching of some sort. For\nStrauss, Maimonides, Judah Halevi, and Spinoza were all exoteric\nwriters. Despite the profound differences between them, Maimonides and\nSpinoza both outwardly teach that philosophy and revelation are\nreconcilable with one another. Yet, according to Strauss, the careful\nreader will notice that their respective arguments actually suggest\nthe opposite: that philosophy and revelation are in fact\nirreconcilable. Halevi, on the other hand, outwardly teaches that\nphilosophy and revelation are irreconcilable. But whereas\nHalevi\u2019s dismissal of philosophy in the face of revelation seems\nto suggest that philosophy is not a challenge for revelation, Strauss\nargues that the careful reader will notice that Halevi\u2019s\nargument in fact suggests the opposite: that philosophy is not just a\nchallenge for revelation but a supremely dangerous one.\n\nDuring his New School years, Strauss also delved more deeply into\nancient philosophy to explore the themes of persecution and writing.\nStrauss\u2019s fourth book, On Tyranny: An Interpretation of\nXenophon\u2019s \u201cHiero,\u201d was published in 1948.\nWhereas the dominant reading of Plato\u2019s Republic understands\nPlato to be advocating that philosophers should rule, Strauss argues\nthat Plato actually viewed such a situation as untenable since it\nwould require the consent of non-philosophers, the unwise. \nOn Tyranny concerns itself with what Strauss claims is the\nnecessary condition for the rule of the wise which is that\nonly the wise alone can secure justice for the city (OT,\n193).  In this study, Strauss offers a close reading of the\nrhetoric of Xenophon\u2019s dialogue, which highlights, for Strauss,\nthe tension between the philosophical quest for truth and the\nrequirements of society.\n\nStrauss accepted a position at the University of Chicago in 1949,\nwhere he would teach until his retirement in 1967. Upon joining\nChicago\u2019s faculty, Strauss gave a series of lectures on\n\u201cNatural Right and History,\u201d which would be published in\n1953 under the same title. Natural Right and History remains\nStrauss\u2019s best-known American work but its basic worry is an\nextension of his early doubts about the ability of twentieth-century\nphilosophy to respond to the challenges of political and moral\nrelativism. In the United States, and in the department of political\nscience at Chicago, Strauss criticized what he took to be the moral\nrelativism upon which the social sciences rested. He begins the book\nwith an analysis of Max Weber, one of the principle founders of the\nacademic discipline of social science, and attempts to show a direct\nline leading from Weber\u2019s positivism to historicism, which\nStrauss defines as the view that \u201call human thoughts or beliefs\nare historical\u201d (NRH, p. 25). He then contrasts modern\nconceptions of natural right, beginning with Hobbes, with ancient\nconceptions, beginning with Plato. The former, argues Strauss, ends in\nhistoricist relativism, in which there are no moral, political, or\nscientific standards beyond particular historical contexts.\nNatural Right and History asks, though does not answer, the\nquestion of whether it is possible to return to some concept of nature\nfor understanding who we are as human beings and therefore to some\nnotion of absolute moral standards.\n\nStrauss published two other books and many essays in his later years.\nIn 1958 he published what is likely his most controversial study,\nThoughts on Machiavelli, in which he pronounced\nMachiavelli\u2019s \u201canti-theological ire\u201d the source of\nmodernity. After retiring from Chicago, Strauss taught at Claremont\nMen\u2019s College in California for a year and then joined his old\nfriend Jacob Klein (1899\u20131978) at St. John\u2019s College in\nAnnapolis as a scholar in residence. Strauss died in 1973. The\nArgument and Action of Plato\u2019s \u201cLaws\u201d was\npublished posthumously in 1975. At the time of his death, Strauss had\nalso been at work on studies of Nietzsche, Thucydides, and Xenophon. A\nnumber of important collections of Strauss\u2019s essays have since\nbeen edited and published by some of his former students.\n",
