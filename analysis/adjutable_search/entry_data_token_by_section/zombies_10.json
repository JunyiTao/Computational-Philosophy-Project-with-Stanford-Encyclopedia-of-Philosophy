    "main_text": "Does conceivability entail possibility? || Other objections\n5.4 Other objections \n\nSpecial factors. It has been suggested that there are special\nfactors at work in the psychophysical case which have a strong\ntendency to mislead us. For example it is claimed that what enables us\nto imagine or conceive of states of consciousness is a different\ncognitive faculty from what enables us to conceive of physical facts:\n\u2018there are significant differences between the cognitive factors\nresponsible for Cartesian intuitions [such as those about zombies] and\nthose responsible for modal intuitions of a wide variety of other\nkinds\u2019 (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, p. 449. See also Hill 1997).\nThe suggestion is that these differences help to explain the ease with\nwhich we seem able to conceive of zombies, and the difficulty we have\nin understanding the claim that they are nevertheless impossible.\n\nConditional analysis. Another line of objection rests on\nconditional analyses of the concept of qualia. Roughly, the idea is\nthat if there actually are certain nonphysical properties\nwhich fit our conception of qualia, then that is what qualia are, in\nwhich case zombies are conceivable; but if there are no such\nnonphysical properties, then qualia are whichever physical properties\nperform the appropriate functions, and zombies are not conceivable. It\nis argued that this approach enables physicalists to accept that the\npossibility of zombies is conceivable, while denying that zombies are\nconceivable (Hawthorne 2002a; Braddon-Mitchell 2003. For criticism see\nAlter 2007; Chalmers 2010, pp. 159\u201359).\n\nCausal essentialism. According to the theory of causal\nessentialism, the causal properties of physical properties are\nessential to them. Brian Garrett (2009) exploits this theory to argue\nthat the zombie argument against physicalism depends on broadly Humean\nassumptions about the laws of nature and property identity which\npresuppose the falsity of causal essentialism. If we reject those\nassumptions and accept that some physical properties have essentially\nthe capacity to produce consciousness, then \u2018we cannot accept\nthe genuine possibility of zombie worlds\u2019 even if such worlds\nare conceivable (see also Aranyosi 2010).\n\nMore on zombies\u2019 utterances. Consider a zombie world\nthat is an exact physical duplicate of our world and contains zombie\ntwins of all philosophers, including some who appeal to the\nconceivability argument. Katalin Balog (1999) argues that while their\nutterances would be meaningful, their sentences would not always mean\nwhat they do in our mouths. She further argues \u2014 to oversimplify\n\u2014 that if the conceivability argument were sound in actual\nphilosophers\u2019 mouths, then it would be sound in the mouths of\nzombie philosophers too. But since by hypothesis physicalism is true\nin their world, their argument is not sound. Therefore the\nconceivability argument used by actual philosophers is not sound\neither. If this argument works, it has the piquant feature that\n\u2018the zombies that antiphysicalists think possible in the end\nundermine the arguments that allege to establish their\npossibility\u2019 (502. Chalmers offers brief replies in his 2003;\n2010, pp. 159\u201360).\n\nThe anti-zombie argument for physicalism. The conceivability\nargument \u2014 which assumes physicalism entails that zombies are\nimpossible \u2014 purports to refute it by showing they are possible.\nAs we saw, the simplest version of this argument goes: (1) zombies are\nconceivable; (2) whatever is conceivable is possible; (3) therefore\nzombies are possible. However, \u2018anti-zombies\u2019 \u2014\nduplicates of ourselves made conscious by the purely physical facts\n(Frankish 2007) \u2014 also seem conceivable. So we have a parallel\nargument: (1*) anti-zombies are conceivable; (2) whatever is\nconceivable is possible; (3*) therefore anti-zombies are possible. But\n(3) and (3*) cannot both be true, since if the purely physical facts\nabout anti-zombies make them conscious, then the exactly similar\nphysical facts about zombies make them conscious too, and they are not\nzombies after all (Frankish 2007; Marton 1998; Piccinini 2017;\nSturgeon 2000, pp. 114\u2013116). One moral is that we should reject\nthe inference from conceivability to possibility. (Brown 2010 argues\nthat if anti-zombies are conceivable, then zombies are inconceivable.)\nThe most promising reply for exponents of the conceivability argument\nseems to be to deny that anti-zombies are conceivable (Chalmers 2010,\n180).\n",
