Consider the expressions \u2018the Morning\nStar\u2019 and \u2018the Evening Star\u2019. Both refer to (or at\nleast denote) the planet Venus, but there are contexts in which it\nseems incorrect to say that they have the same meaning. For example,\nit was an astronomical discovery that the Morning Star was identical\nto the Evening Star, so it would be odd to treat an expression like\n\u2018The Morning Star is the Evening Star\u2019 as merely asserting\nsome object to be self-identical. In a similar vein, if we utter\n(6),\n\n(6) George wondered whether the Morning Star is the Evening Star.\n\n\nwe are most likely not saying that George was curious about whether\nVenus was identical to itself.\n\nFrege proposed that that the solution to this puzzle involved the\nintroduction of senses\u2014abstract objects that fix the referents\nof these expressions, each having a different cognitive significance.\nIn the case of (6), the Fregean solution would be to say that there\nare different senses attached to \u2018the Morning Star\u2019 and\n\u2018the Evening Star\u2019. If we take these expressions to be\nstanding proxy for definite descriptions, then (6) can be unpacked as\nin (6\u2032).\n\n(6\u2032) George wondered whether the star that appears in the\nmorning is identical to the star that appears in the evening.\n\n\nRussell saw that scope relations are relevant here. So, for example,\nsentences like (6) evince what are sometimes called de\ndicto/de re ambiguities. There are circumstances under\nwhich George has some object in particular in mind and is wondering,\nof that object, whether it is the star that appears in the evening. We\ncan use (6) to report this fact as well; In this case we may think of\nthe description as taking wide scope relative to the propositional\nattitude verb \u2018wondered\u2019 yielding a logical form like\n(7).\n\n(7) The star x that appears in the morning is such that\nGeorge wondered whether x is identical to the star that\nappears in the evening.\n\n\nAlternatively, if George has gone mad and is in fact wondering about\nthe law of identity, this may be represented as in (8), where both\ndescriptions have wide scope.\n\n(8) The star x that appears in the morning is such that the\nstar y that appears in the evening is such that George\nwondered whether x is identical to y.\n\n\nThese considerations speak to a particular semantic consequence, but\nas Coppock (forthcoming) notes, the analysis of descriptions has also\nbecome an inflection point in global disputes around semantic\nframeworks. For example Coppock notes that the analysis of\ndescriptions may provide evidence in the choice between Situation\nSemantics (and presumably, Davidson-style event-based semantic\ntheories)\u00a0and Dynamic Semantics.\n",
