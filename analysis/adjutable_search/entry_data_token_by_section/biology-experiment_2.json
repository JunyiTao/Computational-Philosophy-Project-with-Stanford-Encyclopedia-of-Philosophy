    "main_text": "Experimentation and Causal Reasoning || Mechanistic Constitution and Interlevel Experiments\n1.3 Mechanistic Constitution and Interlevel Experiments\n\nExperimental methodology has traditionally been mainly concerned with\ninferring causal dependencies. However, recent research suggests that\nwe need to broaden its scope. A considerable body of scholarship\ndocuments that much biological research is best described in terms of\nthe search for mechanisms, which may be understood as collections of\nentities and activities that produce a phenomenon that biologists want\nto understand (e.g., Wimsatt 1974, Machamer, Darden and Craver 2000,\nGlennan 2005, Bechtel 2006, Craver 2007a). Mechanisms are both what\nbiological science is aiming at and a means to this end, for sketches\nor schemes of mechanisms can guide scientists in the discovery of\nmissing parts (Darden and Craver 2002, Scholl and Nickelsen 2015).\n\nAccording to Craver (2007b), we should distinguish between two kinds\nof relations that make up mechanisms: (1) causal and (2) constitutive\nrelations. The former may hold between different parts of a mechanism.\nFor example, in the basic mechanism of synaptic transmission at the\nterminal part of a neuron, the influx of calcium causes the release of\nneurotransmitter in the space between the synaptic terminal and the\npostsynaptic cell membrane. This causal link can be understood pretty\nmuch as discussed in the last two sections. The other kind of\nrelation, mechanistic constitutive relevance (or just mechanistic\nconstitution) holds between the parts and of a mechanism and the\nphenomenon the mechanism is for. For example, the influx of calcium\ninto an axon terminal, together with other events, constitutes the\nphenomenon of synaptic transmission. Craver (2007b) contends that this\nis not a causal relation because the relata cannot be viewed as\ndistinct and non-overlapping.\n\nBut what defines constitutive relevance? Inspired by interventionism\nabout causality, Craver argued that it is best defined by the kinds of\ninterventions that are used by biologists in order to find out whether\nsome entity and an associated activity are part of a mechanism: by\ncertain kinds of experiments. In particular, there are two kinds of\nso-called interlevel experiments the combination of which establishes\n(and defines) constitutive relevance. In the first kind, an\nintervention is performed on some part and an ensuing change is\nobserved in the phenomenon under study. To return to our synaptic\nexample, a calcium antagonist may be used to show that preventing the\nbinding of calcium ions to their receptors prevents the release of\nneurotransmitter. This is a bottom-up experiment. The second kind of\ninter-level experiment intervenes on the phenomenon as a whole in\norder to see some change in the parts. For example, stimulating\nsynaptic transmission by increasing the rate by which action\npotentials arrive at the terminal will lead to a measurable increase\nin calcium influx at this terminal. This can be done, for example, by\nasking a subject to perform a cognitive task (such as trying to\nmemorize something) and by observing changes in calcium concentration\nby functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thus, mechanistic\nconstitution is defined by the mutual manipulability of the parts of\nmechanisms and the mechanism as a whole.\n\nRecent debate has challenged the mutual manipulability account\n(Leuridan 2012, Harinen 2018, Romero 2015). One issue is that\ninter-level experiments are necessarily \u201cfat-handed\u201d\n(Baumgartner and Gebharter 2016) because they change the values of at\nleast two different variables residing at different levels (e.g.,\ncalcium binding and synaptic transmission, where the former is a part\nof the latter). But this threatens to undermine the inferences to\nmechanistic constitution. A possible solution might consist in\ninferring constituents abductively, by positing constitutive relations\nas the best explanation for the presence of common causes that\nunbreakably correlate phenomena and their constituents (Baumgartner\nand Casini 2017).\n\nThus, the discovery of mechanisms in biology may require a set of\nexperimental reasoning principles that must supplement Mill\u2019s\nmethods, even if there are considerable similarities between these\nprinciples and the better-known principles of causal inference\n(Harbecke 2015).\n",
