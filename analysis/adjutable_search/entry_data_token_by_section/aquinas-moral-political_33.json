    "main_text": "Law || Law needs to be coercive\n7.4 Law needs to be coercive\n\nIn a world (paradise) of saints (completely virtuous persons), there\nwould be need for law but not for coercion; so coercion is not part of\nAquinas\u2019s definition of law and law\u2019s directive force can\nbe contrasted with its coercive force (and see 6.1(ii) above). But in\nour actual world the need for (the threat of) coercion is such that\nAquinas will say without qualification that law ought to have coercive\nforce [vis coactiva] as well as directive [vis\ndirectiva]; he even says that it is a characteristic of law\n[de ratione legis] (ST I-II q. 96 a. 5), despite not\nincluding it in his official definition of law\u2019s nature [its\nratio] (q. 90. a. 3).\n\nIt is not quite accurate to say that the state or its government has a\nmonopoly of force, since one can justifiably use force as a citizen to\ndefend oneself or others from an attack or assault that is not itself\njustified (being criminal or insane), and this requires no\nauthorization. Still, Aquinas insistently draws a distinction between\nprivate and public use of force. Only public authority can punish or\nrightly engage in war, and it is reasonable for public authorities to\nseek a virtual monopoly on what would now be called police operations\nfor the prevention, suppression, and detection of crime. Private\npersons can never rightly intend precisely to harm or kill, though\nthey can knowingly bring about harm or death as a proportionate\nside-effect of intending to block an attack (3.4.1 above). Persons\nwith public authority can, Aquinas thinks, rightly intend to kill (or\ninjure) in the exercise of their duty to suppress the attacks of\ncriminals, pirates, and other public or private enemies. (He does not\nexplore those borderland or badland \u2013 \u201cwild west\u201d\n\u2013 situations where the distinction between public and private is\nindistinct.)\n\nThe paradigmatic public use of coercion is judicially imposed\npunishment, capital or otherwise. At the core of Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of justified punishment is the notion that offenders are\npunishable because, in choosing to offend, they have excessively\nindulged their will and thereby (he implies) gained a kind of\nadvantage over those who have retrained their own wills from such\nexcess; a just relationship between themselves and their fellow\ncitizens can fittingly be restored by proportionately imposing upon\nsuch offenders something contra voluntatem, contrary to and\nsuppressive of their will: I-II q. 46 a. 6 ad 2. This restoration of a\nfair balance between offenders and the law-abiding is central to what\nAquinas frequently calls the \u201cmedicinal\u201d function of\npunishment, for the medicine of punishment is intended to heal not\nonly offenders (by reforming them) or potential offenders (by\ndeterring them), but also and more centrally the whole community by\nrectifying the disorder of injustice created by the offender\u2019s\nself-preferential violation of justice. On capital punishment see\n3.4.1 above.\n\nAquinas regards as legitimate ground for going to war not only the\ndefence of this or another political community, but also the purpose\nof justly punishing and/or securing compensation. (As justifiable\ngrounds for use of force, it is difficult to distinguish between (i)\ndefence of one\u2019s own community\u2019s (or another\u2019s)\nterritory and constitution, (ii) the recovery or restoration of\nunjustly taken territory or other possessions, and (iii) exaction of\ncompensation for unjust takings or other injuries.)\n",
