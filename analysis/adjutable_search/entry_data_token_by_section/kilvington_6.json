    "main_text": "Theology\n6. Impact and Influence\n\nBesides the particular topics he discussed, Kilvington\u2019s\nextensive use of sophisma argumentation, his mathematization\nof ethics and theology, and his frequent use of hypothetical\n(secundum imaginationem) cases, place his thought in the\nmainstream of fourteenth-century English philosophy and theology. His\nteachings on logic were influential both in England and on the\nContinent. Richard Billingham, Roger Rosetus, William Heytesbury, Adam\nWodeham, and Richard Swineshead were among the English scholars who\nbenefited from Kilvington\u2019s Sophismata. His\nQuaestiones super De generatione et corruptione was quoted by\nRichard Fitzralph, Adam Wodeham, and Blasius of Parma, and his\nQuaestiones super Physicam was familiar to the next\ngeneration of Oxford Calculators, William Heytesbury, John Dumbleton\nand Roger Swineshead (who also may have influenced Parisian masters\nsuch as Nicolas Oresme and John Buridan). But Thomas Bradwardine was\nperhaps the most famous beneficiary of Kilvington\u2019s theory of\nmotion. In his renowned treatise, On the Ratios of Velocities in\nMotions, Bradwardine included most of Kilvington\u2019s\narguments for a new function describing the relation of motive power\nand resistance (see Jung 2022a). Kilvington\u2019s views on future\ncontingents were discussed by masters at the University of Vienna in\nthe first decade of the fifteenth century such as Nicholas of\nDinkelsb\u00fchl, John Berwart of Villingen, Peter of Pulkau, and the\nCarmelite Arnold of Seehausen. His questions on the Ethics\nand the Sentences enjoyed a reputation not only in Oxford but\nalso Paris and were frequently quoted by Adam Junior, John of\nMirecourt, Johanes de Burgo, and Thomas of Krakow (see\nJung-Palczewska\u00a02000b).\n",
