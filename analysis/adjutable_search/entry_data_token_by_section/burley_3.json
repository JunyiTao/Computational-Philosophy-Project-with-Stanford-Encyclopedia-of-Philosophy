Ontology (before 1324): categories and universals\n\nThe first important feature of Burley\u2019s earlier ontology is his belief\nthat apart from substances, quantities, and qualities, the categories\ndo not contain entities in the full sense of the term, but\nrespectus reales, i.e., real aspects of absolute things. In\nthe fourth chapter of his middle commentary on the Categories\n(ch. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, ed. Conti,\npp. 25\u201328), Burley mentions two previous accounts of the problem of\nthe number and distinction of the ten categories. The first (from\nSimon of Faversham\u2019s commentary, q. 12) claims that the categories\nreally divide entities according to their modes of being. The second,\ninspired by Henry of Ghent, admits that\nbeing-in-relation-to-something-else (esse ad aliud), i.e.,\nthe mode of being of the seven non-absolute categories, does not\ninvolve a res distinct from substance, quantity, and quality,\nbut only their real aspects. Although Burley does not explicitly\nendorse either interpretation, he is not exactly neutral on the\nmatter. In fact, his introductory comments together with the amount of\nspace he devotes to each suggest that he agrees with those authors who\nthink that, properly speaking, only the three absolute categories are\nfully things (res). Consequently, Burley presents Henry\u2019s\ninterpretation as emerging from the lack of supporting proof for\nSimon\u2019s thesis (TsP, ch. de numero et sufficientia\npraedicamentorum, ed. Conti, pp. 26\u201327). Moreover, he states that\nthe ten categories can be ordered in terms of their degrees of reality\nand independence, since the non-absolute categories are caused by and\ngrounded in the three absolute ones (TsP, ch. de numero\net sufficientia praedicamentorum, ed. Conti, p. 27).\n\nAt the beginning of his philosophical career, Burley seems to have\nbeen attracted by Henry of Ghent\u2019s theory rather than by the more\nradical one he was to support some thirty years later. As far as the\nconstitutive and distinctive principles of the categories are\nconcerned, however, in the middle commentary on the\nCategories Burley advances the same ideas that he defends in\nhis final commentary. He thinks that what characterizes each category\nis its peculiar mode of being and that this is much more important\nthan the differentiation of essences (TsP, ch. de\nsubstantia, ed. Conti, p. 29\u2014the formulation of this\nthesis corresponds almost verbatim to that of the final\ncommentary).\n\nRegarding the relation of the ten categories to being (ens\ntranscendens) and the determination of what properly belongs in\nthe categories, Burley\u2019s position is unchanged between his earlier and\nlater commentaries on the Categories and Physics. On\nthe former question, his Categories commentaries are\ninfluenced by Albert the Great. They contain only the brief remark\nthat being, as a transcendental, is predicated analogically of the\ncategories (see the ch. de aequivocatione). By contrast, the\ntwo Physics commentaries provide an exhaustive treatment of\nboth questions, with some terminological differences. With regard to\nthe first (see the question from book I, utrum ens sit aequivocum\nad decem praedicamenta\u2014whether being is equivocal in\nrelation to the ten categories, pp. 192\u201394), Burley affirms that\nbeing is both univocal and analogical with respect to the categories:\nunivocal because the items falling under the categories are called\n\u2018beings\u2019 according to a single concept, and analogical\nbecause being is possessed by the categories in different \nways\u2014directly by substance and secondarily by accidents. In his final\ncommentary on the Physics (book I, fols. 12vb\u201313ra), Burley\nmaintains that being is both univocal and equivocal with respect to\nthe ten categories: univocal broadly speaking because a single concept\ncorresponds to it (even though categorial entities are subsumed under\nit in different ways), and equivocal, though not most strictly,\nbecause this single concept is attributed to beings (entia)\naccording to a hierarchy of value. In short, the two commentaries\ndiffer only in their use of the terms \u2018analogical\u2019 and\n\u2018equivocal\u2019. In the first commentary, Burley uses the term\n\u2018equivocal\u2019 for those terms Boethius, in his own\ncommentary on the Categories, defines as equivocal by chance\n(a casu), and the term \u2018analogical\u2019 for those\nBoethius calls deliberately equivocal (a consilio). In the\nsecond, Burley calls \u2018equivocal properly speaking\u2019\n(proprie) those terms Boethius refers to as \u2018\ndeliberately equivocal\u2019, and \u2018equivocal most\nstrictly\u2019 (magis proprie) those Boethius calls\n\u2018by chance\u2019.\n\nMore interesting is Burley\u2019s solution to the problem of which entities\nproperly fall under which categories. Unlike most medieval thinkers,\nhe was well aware of the importance of this question, which he\ndiscusses in his middle and final commentaries on the\nCategories (ch. de relatione), as well as in his\nLsP (ch. de quando, fol. 57va). According to the\ncommon realist view, not only simple accidental forms (such as\nwhiteness), but also the compound entities they cause when inhering in\nsubstances (a white thing\u2014album) belong to the nine\ncategories of accident. Burley denies this, since he regards the\nentities resulting from the combination of substance and accidental\nforms as mere aggregates: accidental beings (entia per\naccidens) lacking in any real unity. He claims that what is\nsignified by abstract terms, i.e., simple forms such as whiteness and\nfatherhood, properly falls under the categories, whereas what is\nsignified by concrete accidental terms does not. An aggregate may be\nsaid to belong, improperly and reductively, to the category to which\nits accidental form belongs (Tsp, ch. de relatione,\ned. Conti, pp. 60\u201361; EP, chs. de relatione fol.\n35va, and de qualitate, fol. 41rb). Concrete substance-terms\n(such as \u2018man\u2019) are different, however. For even though\nthey signify composites, they signify beings with a real, per\nse unity that properly belongs to the category of substance. In\nthis case, the abstract forms connoted by concrete substance terms\n(e.g., the form of humanity by \u2018man\u2019) do not lie outside\nthe nature of the things themselves, i.e., the individual substances\nfor which the concrete substance-terms supposit. Thus, both the form\nand its substance belong to the same categorial field (EP,\nch. de denominativis, fol. 19va\u2013b). In this case, the\nindividual substances are the bearers (supposita) of the form\nand not its subject (subiecta), as they are instantiations of\nit and not mere vessels of inherence (TdU, p. 58; see also\nDe relativis, p. 168).\n\nBurley\u2019s earlier position on the question of the number of categories\nimplies a \u2018soft\u2019 attitude towards the problem of defining\nand classifying the types of identity, since it is evident that the\nnon-absolute categories could be considered similar to the absolute\nones. Burley does not deal with this subject in his middle commentary\non the Categories, however, but in the Quaestiones in\nlibrum Perihermenias (q. 4), following Henry of Ghent, he\nmaintains that (1) there are three different kinds of identity: real\n(realis), notional (secundum rationem), and\nintentional (secundum intentionem); (2) intentional\ndifference is something between real and notional difference; and (3)\ntwo things differ intentionally if and only if they are constitutive\nof the same thing without their definitions overlapping, such that\neach can be understood independently of the other, and even together\nwith the negation of the other (QP, q. 4, p. 273). Even so,\nhe does not use this logical machinery to explain the relationship\nbetween absolute and non-absolute categories, but only to clarify the\nrelations between genus and difference, essence and being\n(esse). He maintains that there is no real distinction\nbetween essence and being (as Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome had\ntaught), but that they are only intentionally distinct.\n\nThe most important feature of Burley\u2019s early ontology is his claim\nthat the being (esse) of universals coincides with the being\nof their instantiations as particulars, so that universals can be said\nto be everlasting because of the succession of these particulars, not\nbecause of a peculiar kind of esse (TsP, ch. se\nsubstantia, ed. Conti, p. 34; see also Ean, the question\nin book I, utrum universale habeat esse extra \nanimam\u2014whether what is universal has real being outside the \nmind\u2014,fols. 9ra\u201311ra). In his middle commentary on the De\ninterpretatione (pp. 53\u201356) Burley also speaks of mental\nuniversals, i.e., the concepts through which our mind relates general\nnames to their significata. We might sum up his position on\nuniversals in these texts as follows: (1) universals exist in a\ntwofold way, as common natures in extramental reality and as concepts\nin our minds; (2) real universals are naturally suited to be present\nin many things as their primary metaphysical components; (3) mental\nuniversals are partially caused in our minds by common natures\nexisting outside our minds; and (4) real universals have no being\n(esse) outside the being of their particular\ninstantiations.\n\nBurley\u2019s theory of universals is obviously a form of moderate realism,\nbut it differs from that defended by other authors such as Thomas\nAquinas. According to Aquinas, universals exist in potentia\noutside the mind, but in actu within the mind, whereas on\nBurley\u2019s account they exist in actu extra animam, since their\nbeing is the same as the being of individuals, which is actual. For\nBurley, a universal is in actu if and only if there is at\nleast one individual instantiating it. Therefore, our mind does not\ngive actuality to universals, but only a separate mode of\nexistence.\n",
