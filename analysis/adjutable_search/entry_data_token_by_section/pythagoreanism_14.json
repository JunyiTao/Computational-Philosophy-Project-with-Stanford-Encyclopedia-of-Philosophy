In one passage, however, he assigns\nnot just Plato\u2019s principles, the one and the dyad, to \u201cthe\nancients,\u201d who in context seem likely to be the Pythagoreans,\nbut also a development of the Platonic system according to which the\none was regarded as beyond being (Fr. 48 Taran; see Burkert 1972a,\n63\u201364; Dillon 2003, 56\u201357). Some scholars reject this\nwidely held view on the grounds that this fragment of Speusippus is\nspurious (Zhmud 2012a, 424\u2014425, who cites other scholars; Taran\n1981, 350ff.; for a response see Dillon 2014, 251) and if this were\ntrue it would seriously weaken the case for supposing that\nNeopythagoreanism began already in the Academy. Speusippus also wrote\na book On Pythagorean Numbers (Fr. 28 Taran), which builds on\nideas attested for the early Pythagoreans (e.g., ten as the perfect\nnumber, although Zhmud regards the perfection of ten as a Platonic\nrather than a Pythagorean doctrine 2012a, 404\u201309). We cannot be\nsure, however, either that the title goes back to Speusippus or that\nhe assigned all ideas in it to the Pythagoreans. Aristotle twice cites\nagreement between Speusippus and the Pythagoreans (Metaph.\n1072b30 ff.; EN 1096b5\u20138), which might suggest that\nSpeusippus himself had identified the Pythagoreans as his predecessors\nin these areas. Speusippus and Xenocrates denied that the creation of\nthe universe in Plato\u2019s Timaeus should be understood\nliterally; when the view that the cosmos was only created in thought\nand not in time is assigned to Pythagoras in the later doxography\n(A\u00ebtius II 4.1 \u2014 Diels 1958, 330), it certainly looks as if\nan idea which had its origin in the interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus in the Academy is being assigned back to Pythagoras\n(Burkert 1972a, 71). The evidence is not sufficient to conclude that\nSpeusippus routinely assigned Platonic and Academic ideas to the\nPythagoreans (Taran 1981, 109), but there is enough evidence to\nsuggest that he did so in some cases.\n\nSpeusippus\u2019 successor as head of the Academy, Xenocrates, may\nactually have followed some version of the Pythagorean way of life,\ne.g., he was apparently a vegetarian, refused to give oaths, was\nprotective of animals and followed a highly structured daily regimen,\nsetting aside time for silence (Dillon 2003, 94\u201395 and 2014,\n254\u2013257; Burkert, however, argues that he rejected\nmetempsychosis [1972a, 124]). He wrote a book entitled Things\nPythagorean, the contents of which are unfortunately unknown\n(Diogenes Laertius IV 13). In the extant fragments of his writings, he\nrefers to Pythagoras by name once, reporting that \u201che discovered\nthat the musical intervals too did not arise apart from number\u201d\n(Fr. 9 Heinze). Several doctrines of Xenocrates are also assigned to\nPythagoras in the doxographical tradition, e.g., the definition of the\nsoul as \u201ca number moving itself,\u201d which Xenocrates clearly\ndeveloped on the basis of Plato\u2019s Timaeus (Plutarch,\nOn the Generation of the Soul 1012d; A\u00ebtius IV\n2.3\u20134). This suggests that Xenocrates, like Speusippus, may have\nassigned his own teachings back to Pythagoras or at least treated\nPythagoras as his precursor in such as way that it was easy for others\nto do so (Burkert 1972a, 64\u201365; Dillon 2003, 153\u2013154;\nZhmud [2012a, 55 and 426\u2013427] disputes this interpretation).\n\nYet another member of the early Academy, Heraclides of Pontus\n(Gottschalk 1980), in a series of influential dialogues, further\ndeveloped the presentation of Pythagoras as the founder of philosophy.\nIn the dialogue, On the Woman Who Stopped Breathing,\nPythagoras is presented as the inventor of the word\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (Frs. 87\u201388 Wehrli = Diogenes Laertius\nProem 12 and Cicero, Tusc. V 3.8). Although some scholars\nhave tried to find a kernel of truth in the story (e.g., Riedweg 2005,\n90 ff., for a response see Huffman 2008b), its definition of the\nphilosopher as one who seeks wisdom rather than possessing it is\nregarded by many scholars as a Socratic/Platonic formulation, which\nHeraclides, in his dialogue, is assigning to Pythagoras as part of a\nliterary fiction (Burkert 1960 and 1972a, 65). Heraclides also assigns\nto Pythagoras a definition of happiness as \u201cthe knowledge of the\nperfection of the numbers of the soul\u201d (Fr. 44 Wehrli), in which\nagain the Platonic account of the numerical structure of the soul in\nthe Timaeus appears to be fathered on Pythagoras. Other\nfragments show Heraclides\u2019 further fascination with the\nPythagoreans. He developed what would become one of the canonical\naccounts of Pythagoras\u2019 previous incarnations (Fr. 89 Wehrli).\nPerhaps on the basis of the Pythagorean Philolaus\u2019 astronomical\nsystem, he developed the astronomical theory, later to be championed\nby Copernicus, according to which the apparent daily motion of the sun\nand stars was to be explained by the rotation of the earth (Frs.\n104\u2013108; see on Hicetas and Ecphantus above, sect. 3.6). For a\ndifferent view of Heraclides\u2019 relation to the Pythagoreans see\nZhmud 2012a, 427\u2013432.\n\nIn contrast to the fascination with and glorification of Pythagoras in\nthe Academy after Plato\u2019s death, Aristotle did not treat\nPythagoras as part of the philosophical tradition at all. In the\nsurveys of his predecessors in his extant works, Aristotle does not\ninclude Pythagoras himself and he evidently presented him in his lost\nspecial treatises on the Pythagoreans only as a wonder-worker and\nfounder of a way of life. While Aristotle did acknowledge close\nconnections between Plato\u2019s late theory of principles (One and\nIndefinite Dyad) and fifth-century Pythagoreans, he also sharply\ndistinguished Plato from the Pythagoreans on a series of important\npoints (Metaph. 987b23 ff.), perhaps in response to the\nAcademy\u2019s tendency to assign Platonic doctrines to Pythagoras.\nAristotle\u2019s students Eudemus, in his histories of arithmetic,\ngeometry and astronomy and Meno, in his history of medicine, follow\nAristotle\u2019s practice of not mentioning Pythagoras himself,\nreferring to individual Pythagoreans such as Philolaus or to the\nPythagoreans as a group. Eudemus assigns the Pythagoreans a number of\nimportant contributions to the sciences but does not give them the\ndecisive or foundational role found in the Neopythagorean tradition.\nAristotle\u2019s pupils Dicaearchus (Porphyry, VP 19) and\nAristoxenus do mention Pythagoras but this is because they are\nfocusing on the the Pythagorean way of life and the history of the\nPythagorean communities. Neither assign to Pythagoras or the\nPythagoreans the characteristics of Neopythagoreanism. Aristoxenus is\none of the most important and extensive sources for Pythagoreanism\n(see 3.5 above). He presents Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans in a\npositive manner but avoids the hagiography and extravagant claims of\nthe later Neopythagorean tradition. The standard view is that he tries\nto emphasize the rational as opposed to the religious side of\nPythagoras (e.g. Burkert 1972a, 200\u2013205), but several fragments\ndo highlight the religious aspect of Pythagoras\u2019 work, assigning\nhim the doctrine of metempsychosis (fr. 12) and associating him with\nthe Chaldaean Zaratas (Fr. 13) and the Delphic oracle (Fr. 15). It is\nonly by rejecting the authenticity of such fragments (as does Zhmud\n2012a, 88\u201391) that Aristoxenus\u2019 account is purged of\nreligious elements. Dicaearchus\u2019 account of Pythagoreas is also\nusually viewed as positive. He is supposed to have presented\nPythagoras as the model of the practical life as opposed to the\ncontemplative life (Jaeger 1948, 456; Kahn 2001, 68). However,\nDicaearchus presents a very sarcastic account of Pythagoras\u2019\nrebirths according to which he was reborn as the beautiful prostitute\nAlco (Fr. 42) and careful reading of his other accounts of Pythagoras\nsuggests that he may have presented him as a charismatic charlatan who\nbewitched his hearers (Fr. 42) and was seen as a threat to the\nestablished laws of the state and hence was refused entrance by such\ncity-states as Locri (Fr. 41a). Thus, Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus were\nas divided in their interpretation of Pythagoras as were Heraclitus\nand Empedocles in earlier centuries. The Peripatetic tradition as a\nwhole is in strong contrast, then, with the Academy insofar as it\nemphasizes Pythagoreans rather than Pythagoras himself. When\nPythagoras is mentioned, it is mostly in connection with the way of\nlife, and interpretations range from positive to strongly satirical\nbut in either case avoid the hagiography of the Neopythagorean\ntradition. \n\nIt is then one of the great paradoxes of the ancient Pythagorean\ntradition that Aristotle\u2019s successor, Theophrastus, evidently\naccepted the Academic lionization of Pythagoras, and identifies\nPlato\u2019s one and the indefinite dyad as belonging to the\nPythagoreans (Metaph. 11a27 ff.), although Aristotle is\nemphatic that this pair of principles in fact belong to Plato\n(Metaph. 987b25\u201327). Since Theophrastus\u2019 work,\nTenets in Natural Philosophy, was the basis of the later\ndoxographical tradition, it may be that Theophrastus is responsible\nfor the Neopythagorean Pythagoras of the Academy dominating the later\ndoxography, the Pythagoras who originated the one and the indefinite\ndyad (A\u00ebtius I 3. 8), but it may also be that the Pythagorean\nsections of the doxography were rewritten in the first century BCE,\nunder the influence of the Neopythagoreanism of that period (Burkert\n1972a, 62; Zhmud 2012a, 455).\n\nThe standard view has thus been that the Academy was the origin of\nNeopythagoreanism with its glorification of Pythagoras and its\ntendency to assign mature Platonic views back to Pythagoras and the\nPythagoreans. Aristotle and the Peripatetics on the other hand\ndiminish the role of Pythagoras himself and, while noting connections\nbetween Plato and the Pythagoreans, carefully distinguish Pythagorean\nphilosphy from Platonism. Zhmud has recently put forth a challenge to\nthis view arguing the situation is almost the reverse: the Academy in\ngeneral regards Pythagoras and Pythagoreans favorably but does not\nassign mature Platonic views to them, it is rather Aristotle who ties\nPlato closely to the Pythagoreans (2012a, 415\u2013456).\n",
