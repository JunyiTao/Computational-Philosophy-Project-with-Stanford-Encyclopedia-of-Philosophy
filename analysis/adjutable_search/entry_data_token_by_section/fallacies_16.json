    "main_text": "Current issues in fallacy theory || The nature of fallacies\n4.1 The nature of fallacies\n\nA question that continues to dog fallacy theory is how we are to\nconceive of fallacies. There would be advantages to having a unified\ntheory of fallacies. It would give us a systematic way of demarcating\nfallacies and other kinds of mistakes; it would give us a framework\nfor justifying fallacy judgments, and it would give us a sense of the\nplace of fallacies in our larger conceptual schemes. Some general\ndefinition of \u2018fallacy\u2019 is wanted but the desire is\nfrustrated because there is disagreement about the identity of\nfallacies. Are they inferential, logical, epistemic or dialectical\nmistakes? Some authors insist that they are all of one kind: Biro and\nSiegel, for example, that they are epistemic, and Pragma-dialectics\nthat they are dialectical. There are reasons to think that all\nfallacies do not easily fit into one category.\n\nTogether the Sophistical Refutations and Locke\u2019s\nEssay are the dual sources of our inheritance of fallacies.\nHowever, for four reasons they make for uneasy bedfellows. First, the\nad fallacies seem to have a built-in dialectical character,\nwhich, it can be argued, Aristotle\u2019s fallacies do not have (they\nare not sophistical refutations but are in sophistical\nrefutations). Second, Aristotle\u2019s fallacies are logical\nmistakes: they have no appropriate employment outside eristic\nargumentation whereas the ad-fallacies are instances of\nad-arguments, often appropriately used in dialogues. Third,\nthe appearance condition is part of the Aristotelian inheritance but\nit is not intimately connected with the ad-fallacies\ntradition. A fourth reason that contributes to the tension between the\nAristotelian and Lockean traditions in fallacies is that the former\ngrew out of philosophical problems, largely what are logical and\nmetaphysical puzzles (consider the many examples in Sophistical\nRefutations), whereas the ad-fallacies are more geared\nto social and political topics of popular concern, the subject matter\nthat most intrigues modern researchers on fallacy theory.\n\nAs we look back over our survey we cannot help but observe that\nfallacies have been identified in relation to some ideal or model of\ngood arguments, good argumentation, or rationality. Aristotle\u2019s\nfallacies are shortcomings of his ideal of deduction and proof,\nextended to contexts of refutation. The fallacies listed by Mill are\nerrors of reasoning in a comprehensive model that includes both\ndeduction and induction. Those who have defended SDF as the correct\ndefinition of\n \u2018fallacy\u2019[10]\n take logic simpliciter or deductive validity as the ideal of\nrationality. Informal logicians view fallacies as failures to satisfy\nthe criteria of what they consider to be a cogent argument. Defenders\nof the epistemic approach to fallacies see them as shortfalls of the\nstandards of knowledge-generating arguments. Finally, those who are\nconcerned with how we are to overcome our disagreements in a\nreasonable way will see fallacies as failures in relation to ideals of\ndebate or critical discussions.\n\nThe standard treatment of the core fallacies has not emerged from a\nsingle conception of good argument or reasonableness but rather, like\nmuch of our unsystematic knowledge, has grown as a hodgepodge\ncollection of items, proposed at various time and from different\nperspectives, that continues to draw our attention, even as the\nstandards that originally brought a given fallacy to light are\nabandoned or absorbed into newer models of rationality. Hence, there\nis no single conception of good argument or argumentation to be\ndiscovered behind the core fallacies, and any attempt to force them\nall into a single framework, must take efforts to avoid distorting the\ncharacter originally attributed to each of them.\n",
