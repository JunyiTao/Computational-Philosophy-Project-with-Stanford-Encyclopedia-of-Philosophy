    "main_text": "Relational Autonomy\n3. Relational Autonomy\n\nThe cases above draw attention to the fact that there is disagreement\namong theorists of autonomy, and among feminist theorists, over\nwhether they are examples in which the agent\u2019s autonomy is\ndiminished.\n\nOne way to resolve the disagreement might be to adopt what could be\ncalled a \u201cthin\u201d or \u201cminimalist\u201d conception of\nautonomy. On this conception, agents are autonomous just in case\ncertain minimal conditions for human flourishing obtain, because the\npreferences, choices, and so forth that one adopts in this state of\nwell-functioning should be considered to be \u201cone\u2019s\nown\u201d. Sarah Buss, for example, advocates such a position:\n\nThe key to\u2026self-governing agency is the distinction between a\nhealthy human being and a human being who suffers from some\npsychological or physiological \u2018affliction\u2019 (e.g., intense\npain, fear, anxiety, fatigue, depression, and obsession). (Buss 2005,\n215)\n\n\nAn agent\u2019s autonomy is impaired, therefore, only if she\nsuffers an affliction that is severe enough to distort and pathologize\nher capacity for reasoning; the default position is that she is\nautonomous. Narayan also suggests a thin conception of autonomy:\n\nA person\u2019s choice should be considered autonomous as long as the\nperson was a \u2018normal adult\u2019 with no serious cognitive or\nemotional impairments and was not subject to literal outright coercion\nby others. (Narayan 2002, 429)\n\n\nOn minimalist conceptions of autonomy, most of the agents described in\nthe hard cases would be autonomous because minimal conditions for\nflourishing obtain and there is no pathology, cognitive impairment, or\ndirect coercion present. This characterization has its theoretical\nadvantages. For example, Narayan is concerned to limit the\njustification for state interference in individual voluntary choice; a\nminimalist conception may indeed be acceptable for use in theories\nthat regulate relations between the citizen and the state or to\naddress issues of paternalism (Holroyd 2009).\n\nBut minimalism is not the norm within the feminist literature on\nautonomy. It is true that oppressive social conditions do not\ntypically produce pathologies or cognitive impairments; neither do the\nsocial conditions of oppression usually constitute direct coercion\nsufficient to erode autonomy. However, minimalism overlooks the\ncomplex effects of gender norms and oppressive social conditions on\nagency (e.g., Bierria 2014; Liebow 2016; Johnston 2017). The hard\ncases are hard because they suggest that gender norms and oppressive\nconditions, in addition to factors such as cognitive\nimpairment or direct coercion, potentially undermine or erode\nagents\u2019 capacities for autonomy. Yet it is not clear precisely\nhow this happens.\n\nFeminist or \u201crelational\u201d theories of autonomy attempt to\nanswer the question of how internalized oppression and oppressive\nsocial conditions undermine or erode agents\u2019 autonomy. These\ntheories will be sketched in \u00a74\u20138. Before turning to these\ntheories, some preliminary classifications should be made. Relational\ntheories may be classified as either\n\nprocedural, strongly substantive, or\nweakly substantive, versus\ncausal or constitutive.\n\n\nThe procedural/substantive distinction within relational conceptions\nparallels a distinction within the literature on autonomy more\ngenerally (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 12\u201321). Procedural\ntheories have dominated the debate since the 1970s (Dworkin 1988;\nFrankfurt 1988). They claim that autonomy is achieved when the agent\nundergoes, or has the capacity to undergo, an internal intellectual\nprocess of reflecting on her motivations, beliefs, and values, and\nthen revising her preferences in the light of such reflection. This\nprocess is said to be \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d because the\noutcomes of the process of critical reflection, whatever their\ncontent, will be autonomous. Substantive theories claim that autonomy\nis a value-laden notion. According to \u201cstrong substantive\u201d\napproaches, \u201cthe contents of the preferences or values that\nagents can form or act on autonomously are subject to direct normative\nconstraints\u201d (Benson 2005a, 133). A preference to be enslaved or\nto be subservient cannot be autonomous on strong substantive accounts\n(e.g., Charles 2010). \u201cWeak substantive\u201d approaches build\nin normative content, and hence are substantive, yet they do not place\ndirect normative constraints on the contents of agents\u2019\npreferences (Benson 2005a; Richardson 2001). For example, some\naccounts require that agents exhibit moral attitudes to themselves\nsuch as self-respect or a robust sense of their own self-worth to\ncount as autonomous (Govier 1993; McLeod 2002).\n\nIn addition to the procedural/substantive dimension, relational\nconceptions may be classified as either causal or\nconstitutive. Causal conceptions acknowledge the impact of\nboth social relationships and socio-historical circumstances on\nagents\u2019 capacities. Annette Baier points out that agents are\n\u201csecond persons\u201d, that is, \u201cpersons are essentially\nsuccessors, heirs to other persons who formed and cared for\nthem\u201d (Baier 1985, 85). On this view, an agent\u2019s social\nrelationships influence the development of autonomy: \u201cif we ask\nourselves what actually enables people to be autonomous, the answer is\nnot isolation, but relationships\u2014with parents, teachers,\nfriends, loved ones\u201d (Nedelsky 1989, 12). If social\nrelationships cause autonomy to develop, a lack of\nappropriate social relationships can also stunt its development\n(Friedman 1997). Similarly, social and historical conditions (such as\noppressive gender socialization) may promote or impede the capacity\nfor autonomy (e.g., Meyers 1989).\n\nCausal accounts investigate the effects of external\n\u201crelational\u201d factors on agents\u2019 autonomy; they do\nnot offer an analysis of autonomy using such external\nfactors. On constitutively relational accounts, however,\ninterpersonal or social conditions are part of the \u201cdefining\nconditions\u201d of autonomy (Christman 2004, 147). Suppose, for\ninstance, that an agent is subject to severely constraining external\nconditions such as slavery. Marina Oshana argues that such external\nconditions are incompatible with autonomy because autonomy is a\ntemporally extended, \u201cglobal\u201d condition of agents in which\nthey have \u201cde facto power and authority over choices\nand actions significant to the direction of [their lives]\u201d\n(Oshana 2006, 2). Severely constraining external conditions remove the\nde facto power required for autonomy. Other theorists who adopt\nconstitutive accounts focus rather on local autonomy, namely,\nwhat is required for choices, preferences, or desires at\nparticular times to count as autonomous. Suppose, for instance,\nthat autonomous choice at a particular time requires that agents have\navailable to them a \u201cwide enough range of\u2026significant\noptions\u201d at that time (Brison 2000, 285). This account of local\nautonomy is constitutively relational because no matter how robust an\nagents\u2019 psychological capacities, if the relevant external\nconditions do not obtain at a time, it is not possible for the\nagent\u2019s preference at that time to be autonomous.\n\nThe procedural/substantive distinction cuts across the\ncausal/constitutive distinction. Procedural theories are typically\ncausally relational (see \u00a74). For instance, although the\nfeatures required for autonomy on procedural accounts\u2014e.g.,\ncritical reflection\u2014can be affected by oppressive socialization,\nit is in principle possible for the critical faculties of agents in\noppressive environments, even including those who endorse oppressive\nnorms, to be fully intact and hence for them to be fully autonomous.\nAn important feature of procedural theories, however, is their\ncontent-neutral or formal aspect. Andrea Westlund has recently\nendorsed what she calls a formal and constitutively relational\nposition in which interpersonal conditions are included in the\ndefinition of autonomy (see \u00a77). Therefore, content-neutral\ntheories can be constitutively relational. Moreover, weak substantive\ntheories can be causally relational. Weak substantive theories build\nin moral self-regarding attitudes such as self-respect as necessary\nconditions of autonomy. Although these attitudes may be affected by\ninterpersonal and other external conditions, weak substantive theories\nneed not employ the external conditions as defining conditions of\nautonomy (see \u00a76). However, strong substantive theories that\nplace direct constraints on the contents of the preferences permitted\nfor autonomous agents are constitutively relational because, on strong\nsubstantive theories, external conditions are necessary conditions of\nautonomy (see \u00a78).\n",
