    "main_text": "Concluding Remarks || From Theory to Practice\n5.2 Further Reading\n\nMy objective in this article has been to introduce different voting methods\nand to highlight key results and issues that facilitate comparisons\nbetween the voting methods. To dive more into the details of the\ntopics introduced in this article, see Saari 2001, 2008, Nurmi 1998,\nBrams and Fishburn 2002, Zwicker 2012, and the collection of articles\nin Felsenthal and Machover 2012. Some important topics related to the\nstudy of voting methods not discussed in this article include:\n\n Saari\u2019s influential geometric approach to study of voting methods\nand paradoxes (Saari 1995); \n The study of measures of voting power: the probability\nthat a single voter is decisive in an election (Gelman et al. 2002;\nFelsenthal and Machover 1998); \nThe study of probabilistic voting methods: a voting\nmethod in which the output is a lottery over the set of candidates\nrather than a ranking or set of candidates (Brandt 2017); \n Questions about whether it is rational to vote in an election\n(Brennan 2016); and \n The study of methods for ensuring fair and proportional\nrepresentation (Balinksi and Young 1982; Pukelsheim 2017). \n\nFinally, consult List 2013 and Morreau 2014 for a discussion of\nbroader issues in theory of social choice. \n",
