    "main_text": "The Similarity Conception || Accuracy, Style, and Ontology\n3.2 Accuracy, Style, and Ontology\n\nThe fact that relevant properties can be delineated in different ways\ncould potentially provide an answer to the Problem of Style. If \\(M\\)\nrepresenting \\(T\\) involves the claim that \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) are similar\nin a certain respect, the respect chosen specifies the style of the\nrepresentation; and if \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) are in fact similar in that\nrespect (and to the specified degree), then \\(M\\) accurately\nrepresents \\(T\\) within that style. For example, if \\(M\\) and \\(T\\)\nare proposed to be similar with respect to their causal structure,\nthen we might have a style of causal modelling; if \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) are\nproposed to be similar with respect to structural properties, then we\nmight have a style of structural modelling; and so on and so\nforth.\n\nA first step in the direction of such an understanding of styles is\nthe explicit analysis of the notion of similarity. The standard way of\ncashing out what it means for an object to be similar to another\nobject is to require that they co-instantiate properties. In fact,\nthis is the idea that Quine (1969: 117\u2013118) and Goodman (1972:\n443) had in mind in their influential critiques of similarity. The two\nmost prominent formal frameworks that develop this idea are the\ngeometric and contrast accounts (see Decock and Douven 2011 for a\ndiscussion).\n\nThe geometric account, associated with Shepard (1980), assigns objects\na place in a multidimensional space based on values assigned to their\nproperties. This space is then equipped with a metric and the degree\nof (dis)similarity between two objects is the distance between the\npoints representing the two objects in that space. This account is\nbased on the strong assumptions that values can be assigned to all\nfeatures relevant to similarity judgments, which is deemed unrealistic\n(and to the best of our knowledge no one has developed such an account\nin the context of scientific representation).\n\nThis problem is supposed to be overcome in Tversky\u2019s contrast\naccount (1977). This account defines a gradated notion of similarity\nbased on a weighted comparison of properties. Weisberg has recently\nintroduced this account into the philosophy of science where it serves\nas the starting point for his weighted feature matching account of\nmodel world-relations (for details see Weisberg 2012, 2013: ch.\n8). Although the account has some advantages, questions remain whether\nit can capture the distinction between what Niiniluoto (1988:\n272\u2013274) calls \u201clikeness\u201d and \u201cpartial\nidentity\u201d. Two objects are alike to the extent that they\nco-instantiate similar properties (for example, a red phone box and a\nred London bus might be alike with respect to their colour, despite\nnot instantiating the exact same shade of red). Two objects are\npartially identical to the extent that they co-instantiate identical\nproperties. As Parker (2015: 273) notes, contrast based accounts of\nsimilarity like Weisberg\u2019s have difficulties capturing the\nformer, and this is often pertinent in the context of scientific\nrepresentation where models and their targets need not co-instantiate\nthe exact same property. Concerns of this sort have led Khosrowi\n(2020) to suggest that the notion of sharing features should be\nanalysed in a pluralist manner. Sharing a feature sometimes means\nsharing the exact same feature; sometimes it means to share features\nwhich are sufficiently quantitatively close to one another; and\nsometimes it means having features which are themselves\n\u201csufficiently similar\u201d.\n\nA further question that remains for someone who uses the notion of\nsimilarity to answer to the Problem of Style and provide standards of\naccuracy in the manner under consideration here is whether it truly\ncaptures all of scientific practice. Similarity theorists are\ncommitted to the claim that whenever a scientific model represents its\ntarget system, this is established in virtue of a model user\nspecifying a relevant similarity, and if the similarity holds, then\nthe representational relationship is accurate. These universal\naspirations require that the notion of similarity invoked capture the\nrelationship that holds between diverse entities such as a basin-model\nof the San Francisco bay area, a tube map and an underground train\nsystem, and the Lotka-Volterra equations of predator-pray interaction.\nWhether all of these relationships can be captured in terms of\nsimilarity remains an open question. In addition, this view is\ncommited to the idea that idealised aspects of scientific models,\nunderstood as dissimilarities between models and their targets, are\nmisrepresenations and as such the view has difficulty capturing the\npositive epistemic role that such aspects can play (Nguyen 2020). \n\nAnother problem facing similarity based approaches concerns their\ntreatment of the ontology of models. If models are supposed to be\nsimilar to their targets in the ways specified by theoretical\nhypotheses, then they must be the kind of things that can be\nso similar. For material models like the San Francisco Bay model\n(Weisberg 2013), ball and stick models of molecules (Toon 2011), the\nPhillips-Newlyn machine (Morgan and Boumans 2004), or model organisms\n(Ankeny and Leonelli 2021) this seems straightforward because they are\nof the same ontological kind as their respective targets. But many\ninteresting scientific models are not like this: they are what Hacking\naptly describes as \u201csomething you hold in your head rather than\nyour hands\u201d (1983: 216). Following Thomson-Jones (2012) we call\nsuch models non-concrete models. The question then is how\nsuch models can be similar to their targets. At the very least these\nmodels are \u201cabstract\u201d in the sense that they have no\nspatiotemporal location. But if so, then it remains unclear how they\ncan instantiate the sorts of properties specified by theoretical\nhypotheses, since these properties are typically physical,\nand presumably being located in space and time is a necessary\ncondition on instantiating such properties. For further discussion of\nthis objection, and proposed solutions, see Teller (2001: 399),\nThomson-Jones (2010; 2020), and Giere (2009), and Thomasson\n(2020).\n",
