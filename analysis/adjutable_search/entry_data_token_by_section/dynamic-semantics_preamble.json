    "main_text": "\n\nDynamic semantics is a perspective on natural language semantics that\nemphasizes the growth of information in time. It is an approach to\nmeaning representation where pieces of text or discourse are viewed as\ninstructions to update an existing context with new information, the\nresult of which is an updated context. In a slogan: meaning is context\nchange potential. \n\nIt is important to be aware of the abstractness of this perspective so\nas to guard against various non sequiturs. For one thing, one could\neasily think that dynamic semantics or update semantics is committed\nat least in part to an internalist idea of semantics since the\ninformation states are \u201cinternal\u201d\u2014in the sense that\nthey are wholly contained in the individual mind/brain. In other\nwords, one might think that the information states of dynamic\nsemantics are what Putnam (1975) calls \u201cstates in the sense of\nmethodological solipsism\u201d. See the entries on\n scientific realism,\n computational theory of mind,\n externalism about mental content,\n and\n narrow mental content.\n However, the general framework says nothing about what the states\nare. The state could very well include the environment in which the\ninterpreter is embedded and thus contain an \u201cexternal\u201d\ncomponent.\n\nA second possible misunderstanding is that dynamic semantics or update\nsemantics is in complete opposition to classical truth conditional\nsemantics (compare the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory).\n In fact, as this entry will soon make clear, what dynamic semantics\nprovides is a generalization of truth conditional semantics rather\nthan a radically different alternative. The classical meanings become\nthe preconditions for success of the discourse actions.\nDynamic semanticists claim that compositional meanings have\nthe nature of functions or relations and the classical meanings are\nrecoverable from the relational dynamic meanings as\nprojections onto their \u201cinput\u201d coordinate.\n\nThe point of the use of an abstract framework is not to give empirical\npredictions. This is the task of specific realizations inside the\nframework. The framework of dynamic semantics (i) provides a direction\nof thinking and (ii) allows us to import methods from the mathematical\nstudy of the framework. It follows that the question whether natural\nlanguage meaning is intrinsically dynamic does not have an empirical\nanswer. Still, what can be said is that the study of interpretation as\na linearly-ordered process has proven quite fruitful and\nrewarding.\n\nSince dynamic semantics focuses on the discourse actions of sender and\nreceiver, it is in a sense close to use-oriented approaches to meaning\nin philosophy such as the work of Wittgenstein and Dummett. However,\neasy identifications between dynamic semantics and these approaches\nare to be avoided. Dynamic semantics as an abstract framework is\ncompatible with many philosophical ways of viewing meaning and\ninterpretation. Dynamic semantics aims to model meaning and\ninterpretation. You can do that without answering broader\nphilosophical questions such as the question of what it is that makes\nit possible for the subject to be related to these meanings at all.\nFor example, in dynamic predicate logic we take the meaning of\nhorse as given without making any substantial claim about\nwhat it means for a subject to have the concept of horse; we\njust stipulate the subject has it. This is not to say such\nquestions\u2014which are at the center of the work of Wittgenstein\nand Dummett\u2014should not ultimately be answered: it\u2019s just\nthat a model can be of interest even if it does not answer them. (Note\nthat dynamic semantics tries to give a systematic and compositional\naccount of meaning, which makes it markedly different in spirit from\nWittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy.)\n\nOne approach to dynamic semantics is\n discourse representation theory\n (DRT, Kamp 1981). (Closely related to Kamp\u2019s approach is Irene\nHeim\u2019s file change semantics (FCS, Heim 1983a) and the\ndiscourse semantics of Seuren 1985). Meanings in DRT are so-called\ndiscourse representation structures (DRSs). These structures\nare a type of database that contains specific pieces of information.\nIn and of itself a DRS is a static object, but DRT can be said to be a\ndynamic semantic framework because it allows us to understand the\nprocess of composing meanings as a process of merging\ndiscourse representation structures. In this way, information change\nbecomes an integral part of the interpretation process.\n\nOur main focus in this entry is a second approach to dynamic\nsemantics, although we will compare things to DRT along the way. In\nthis second approach, dynamic meanings are types of actions, things\nthat are individuated by the changes they effect. This is the approach\nassociated with dynamic predicate logic (DPL, Groenendijk and\nStokhof 1991a). According to this dynamic semantic tradition, a\nmeaning is a specification of how a receiver\u2019s information state\nwould be modified. It could for instance be a function that maps an\nold information state to one which has been updated with the\ninformation that the meaning embodies. Alternatively, it could be a\nrelation that expresses the kind of information change that the\nmeaning brings about. (For early work in this tradition, see\nGroenendijk and Stokhof 1991a,b; Muskens 1991; Dekker 1993; Vermeulen\n1993; van Eijck 1994; Vermeulen 1994; Krahmer 1995; van den Berg 1996;\nGroenendijk et al. 1996; Aloni 1997; Muskens et al. 1997).\n",
