    "main_text": "Avicenna\n5. Avicenna\n\nThe main reason for the interest of a number of Medieval Jewish\nphilosopher towards Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980\u20131037) might have\nbeen Avicenna\u2019s own interest in a tentative conciliation between\nAristotelian philosophy and religion (see Harvey 2009). Such interest\nwas due to the philosopher\u2019s special attitude towards Islam, and\ntowards Shi\u2018ite Islam in particular, an attitude which the\nAvicennian Jewish philosophers obviously applied to Judaism. It seems\nthat these philosophers regarded Avicenna as a substantial defender of\nreligion over philosophy, so associating him with al-Ghazali\u2019s\nown position with regard to philosophy. In this way, \u201cJewish\nAvicennism\u201d was slowly absorbed into a sort of \u201cJewish\nGhazalism\u201d, aiming at a defense of Judaism against Averroism\n(see below, 6). However, according to a more recent, in-depth, and\nwider examination of all the extant Judeo-Arabic and Hebrew materials\nabout Avicenna as philosopher, mystic, and physician in the Jewish\nMiddle Ages, it is evident that, among Jewish philosophical authors,\nthe \u2018committed Avicennians\u2019 were really few, while the\n\u2018eclectic Avicennians\u2019, who employed a number of more or\nless Avicennian ideas, were very many \u2013 even if some of them did\nnot read Avicenna directly (Freudenthal and Zonta 2012).\n\nAvicenna was the main source of an important doctrine which spread\namong a number of 11th- and 12th-century Jewish\nphilosophers, as once shown by Harry A. Wolfson (Wolfson 1935):\naccording to this doctrine, there are in man\u2019s mind five\ninternal senses (common sense, estimation, imagination, thought, and\nmemory). A first trace of this doctrine was found in Bahya Ibn Paquda:\nhowever, he might have taken it from an Arabic philosophical or\ntheological compendium inspired by Avicenna. Such occasional\nemployment of Avicenna as a source for one particular point of a\nMedieval Jewish philosopher\u2019s thought might have happened in the\ncase of Joseph Ibn Zaddiq\u2019s Book of the Microcosm, as\nobserved by Vajda in his study about the philosophical sources of the\nlatter (see Vajda 1949, 180). A more important case is that of the\nwell-known Spanish Jewish author Judah Halevi (1085\u20131141). In\nhis main Judaeo\u2013Arabic work, the Book of the Khazar (in\nHebrew, Sefer ha-Kuzari), an explicit defence of Judaism with\nrespect to the other religions and to philosophy as well, he\nsignificantly employed Avicenna\u2019s Epistle On the Soul\n(Risala fi l-nafs) as a direct and literal, albeit implicit\nsource for his description of man\u2019s soul in chapter 12 of book\nfive, as definitively shown by David H. Baneth (see his introduction\nto Judah Halevi 1977). Also a more \u201cmystical\u201d work by\nAvicenna, Living Son of the Watchful (Hayy ibn\nYaqzan), apparently inspired Abraham Ibn Ezra in writing his own\nwork in Hebrew on the same subject, the Iggeret Hay ben\nMeqits (around 1150), as shown by Israel Levin (see Levin\n1983).\n\nIn any case, a wider influence of Avicenna\u2019s philosophy on\nMedieval Judaic thought appeared after 1150. The first significant\ncase is that of Abraham Ibn Daud, living in Toledo between 1110 and\n1180 circa. As it is clear from his philosophical work, the\nExalted Faith (al-\u2018Aqida al-rafi\u2019a, lost\nin its Judaeo-Arabic original, but preserved in two\n14th-century Hebrew translations), he was the first Jewish\nAristotelian, but surely employed as his main sources both Avicenna\nand al-Ghazali. As shown in recent studies by Amira Eran, and in\nparticular in her book about the contents of Ibn Daud\u2019s work\n(Eran 1998, 27), Avicennian influences appear mostly in book one of\nthe Exalted Faith, where such philosophical themes as\ncategories, matter and motion, souls and celestial bodies are studied.\nHowever, in treating these themes, Ibn Daud did not directly refer to\nthe contents of Avicenna\u2019s main extant encyclopedia, The\nCure (al-Shifa\u2019), but to his minor encyclopedia of\nlogic, physics and metaphysics: The Salvation\n(al-Najat). Moreover, it might be suggested that in reality\ninstead Ibn Daud employed al-Ghazali as his main source for\nconstructing his own \u201cAvicennism\u201d rather than Avicenna\nhimself (see below, 6), just as a number of later Medieval Jewish\nphilosophers did, beginning with Maimonides. Maimonides appears to\nhave regarded Avicenna not as a really direct and important\nphilosophical source. Although clear echoes of Avicennian doctrines\nabout the distinction between essence and existence, between necessary\nand contingent beings, as well as the well-known Avicennian proof of\nthe existence of God, have been found in the Guide of the\nPerplexed (see Moses Maimonides 1962, 1:xciii-ciii), the explicit\njudgement of Maimonides about Avicenna\u2019s thought appears to be\nsubstantially cool (for a different interpretation of this judgement,\nsee however Dobbs-Weinstein 2002). In his letter to Samuel Ibn Tibbon,\nhe affirms that \u201cAvicenna\u2019s books, although they are\nsubtle and difficult, are not like those by al-Farabi; however, they\nare useful, and he too is an author whose words should be studied and\nunderstood\u201d (Marx 1934\u20131935: 380).\n\nMaimonides\u2019 lukewarm judgement about Avicenna did not prevent\nmany later Jewish scholars from studying his works and employing them\nas sources for their own philosophy. Even the translator of\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, directly referred\nto Avicenna\u2019s doctrines and affirmations about meteorology both\nin his Hebrew translation (including some comments) of\nAristotle\u2019s Meteorology, and in his work Treatise\non \u201cWaters Did Gather\u201d (Ma\u2019amar be-yiqqawu\nha-mayim), as shown by Resianne Fontaine in her critical edition\nand English translation of the former (Fontaine 1995); this Jewish\nphilosopher can be even tentatively seen as a \u2018committed\nAvicennian\u2019. Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, whose many works appear to\nhave been a sort of \u201cbasin of quotations\u201d, referred to a\nnumber of Avicenna\u2019s philosophical works, and employed them as\nsources for his own expositions of Maimonides\u2019 and\nAristotle\u2019s thought, in the Guide to the Guide and in\nthe Opinions of the Philosophers, as well as for some other\nminor works. In particular, he quoted some passages from The\nCure about celestial bodies, mineralogy, zoology, psychology, and\nmetaphysics; he quoted a number of passages of The Salvation\nabout logic and psychology; he made an abridgement of the contents of\nthe Epistle On the Soul; he even quoted short passages from\nAvicenna\u2019s Remarks and Admonitions (al-Isharat\nwa-l-tanbihat); finally, Avicenna was probably one of the main\nsources for Falaquera\u2019s philosophical dictionary, put at the\nbeginning of the Opinions of the Philosophers, as well as for\nhis own classification of sciences in part two of the Beginning of\nWisdom. The influence of Avicenna on Jewish scientific thought\ncontinued after 1300: for example, some traces of it are found also in\nthe Hebrew paraphrase of a pseudo-Avicennian work, made by a\nProven\u00e7al Jewish scholar, Solomon ben Moses of Melgueil (d.\nbetween 1306 and 1309) (see Glasner 1996).\n\nProbably, an important case of eclectic \u201cJewish\nAvicennism\u201d appeared in 14th-century Provence and\nSpain. Its main character was the employment of some aspects of\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy in favor of the Jewish religious tradition\n\u2013 although this aspects are not evidently employed against the\nAristotelian philosophical tradition as represented by Averroes\u2019\nrationalism. As a matter of fact, some of these eclectic \u201cJewish\nAvicennians\u201d tried to arrive at a substantial agreement between\nJewish religion and philosophy; some others might have had an opposite\neffect, as happened for example in the case of Abner of Burgos.\n\nJudah ben Solomon Natan, a physician and translator active in Provence\naround 1330, explicitly declared the reason for his interest in\nAvicenna in the introduction to his Hebrew translation of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Intentions of the Philosophers\n(Maqasid al-falasifa), where he affirmed that he translated\nthat book since it was very useful for reconciling religious tradition\nand philosophy, and he found a substantial correspondence between that\nbook and some parts of Avicenna\u2019s The Cure about\nphysics and metaphysics, as well as Avicenna\u2019s The\nSalvation. Judah Natan\u2019s translation was employed by his\nfriend Todros Todrosi for his own translation of the\n\u201cAvicennist\u201d work The Sources of Questions\n(\u2018Uyun al-masa\u2019il): in the introduction to the\nlatter, he affirms to have found there the same opinion expressed in\nal-Ghazali\u2019s above mentioned book. Here and in his philosophical\nanthology (dating back to 1334) Todros quoted some of Avicenna\u2019s\npassages about logical, physical and metaphysical questions: he took\nthem both from the logical sections of The Cure (he also\nquoted a passage about infinite motion from book three, chapter 8 of\nthe physical section of this work), and from Avicenna\u2019s\nRemarks and Admonitions. Finally, he was the unique Medieval\nHebrew author who wrote an almost complete translation of one of\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophical works: books two and three of The\nSalvation, about physics and metaphysics. Two other\nProven\u00e7al Jewish authors employed Avicenna: Judah Cohen, who\nmight have been active in Provence around 1350, was apparently\ninspired by Avicenna\u2019s Epistle On Love (Risala fi\nl-\u2018ishq) (Vajda 1977, 136); the well-known Jewish\nphilosopher and commentator of Averroes Moses Narboni, living there in\nthe period 1300\u20131360, occasionally quoted some passage from\nThe Cure and The Salvation in his own\n\u201cAverroistic\u201d commentary on the Intentions of the\nPhilosophers (Steinschneider 1893, 318). Various approaches to\nAvicenna are found in 13th- and 14th-century\nSpain: Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics was the main source of Moses\nha-Levi\u2019s Metaphysical (lit.\n\u201cdivine\u201d)Treatise (Maqala ilahiyya),\nwritten in Judaeo-Arabic probably before 1300, whose contents were\nstudied in detail by Vajda (see Vajda 1948) \u2013 here there is one\nof the few cases of \u2018committed Avicennism\u2019; the Jewish\nphilosopher Abner of Burgos (1270\u20131350 circa), both before and\nafter having converted to Christianity, seems to have often employed\nAvicenna in favor of determinism and against Averroes (he claims to\nhave transmitted some lost passages of Avicenna\u2019s The\nOriental Wisdom [al-Hikma al-mashriqiyya]; but see\nSzpiech 2010); Josef Ibn Waqqar, in his Treatise for Reconciling\nPhilosophy and Religious Law (Maqala al-jami\u2018a bayna\nl-falsafa wa-l-shari\u2018a), written in Judaeo-Arabic around\n1360 and analyzed by Vajda, even tried to reconcile Averroes, Avicenna\nand al-Ghazali in a very difficult field: metaphysics (Vajda 1962,\n132). In a different, indirect way the Neoplatonic circle of Jewish\nauthors of Hebrew supercommentaries on Abraham Ibn Ezra\u2019s\nBiblical commentaries, active in Spain in the second half of the\n14th century and in Provence in the first decades of the\n15th century, could have employed Avicennian ideas for\ndefending the doctrine of astral determinism (see Schwartz 1996);\nstill indirectly, Avicenna\u2019s thought might have influenced some\naspect of Hasdai Crescas\u2019 philosophy (see below, 6). According\nto Dov Schwartz, the role played by Avicenna in influencing some\naspects of 14th- and also 15th-century Judaic\nthought was even more widespread than that played by Averroes, who was\nuntil now regarded as the most important \u201cmaster\u201d in Late\nMedieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides (Schwartz 1995, 420).\n",
