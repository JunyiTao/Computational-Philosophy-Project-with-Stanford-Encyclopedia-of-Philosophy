Take the case of\na mother who deceives herself into believing her husband is not\nabusing their daughter because she can\u2019t bear the thought that\nhe is a moral monster (Barnes 1997). Why do we blame her? Here we\nconfront the nexus between moral responsibility for self-deception and\nthe morality of self-deception. Understanding what obligations may be\ninvolved in cases of this sort will help to clarify the circumstances\nin which ascriptions of moral responsibility are appropriate. While\nsome instances of self-deception seem morally innocuous, and others\nmay even be thought salutary in various ways (Rorty 1994), most\ntheorists have thought there to be something morally objectionable\nabout self-deception or its consequences in many cases. Self-deception\nhas been considered objectionable because it facilitates harm to\nothers (Linehan 1982; Gibson 2020; Clifford 1877) and to oneself,\nundermines autonomy (Darwall 1988; Baron 1988), corrupts conscience\n(Butler 1726), violates authenticity (Sartre 1943), manifests a\nvicious lack of courage and self-control that undermines the capacity\nfor compassionate action (Jenni 2003), violates an epistemic duty to\nproperly ground self-ascriptions (Fern\u00e1ndez 2013), violates a\ngeneral duty to form beliefs that \u201cconform to the available\nevidence\u201d (Nelkin 2012), or violates a general duty to respect\nour own values (MacKenzie 2022).\n\nLinehan (1982) argues that we have an obligation to scrutinize the\nbeliefs that guide our actions that is proportionate to the harm to\nothers such actions might involve. When self-deceivers induce\nignorance of moral obligations in connection with the particular\ncircumstances, likely consequences of actions, or nature of their own\nengagements, by means of their self-deceptive beliefs, they may be\nculpable for negligence with respect to their obligation to know the\nnature, circumstances, likely consequences, and so forth of their\nactions (Jenni 2003; Nelkin 2012). Self-deception, accordingly,\nundermines or erodes agency by reducing our capacity for self-scrutiny\nand change (Baron 1988). If I am self-deceived about actions or\npractices that harm others or myself, my abilities to take\nresponsibility and change are also severely restricted.\n\nJoseph Butler (1726), in his well-known sermon \u201cOn\nSelf-Deceit,\u201d emphasizes the ways in which self-deception about\none\u2019s moral character and\nconduct\u2014\u2018self-ignorance\u2019 driven by inordinate\n\u2018self-love\u2019\u2014not only facilitates vicious actions but\nhinders the agent\u2019s ability to change. Such ignorance, claims\nButler, \u201cundermines the whole principle of good \u2026 and\ncorrupts conscience, which is the guide of life\u201d (1726). Holton\n(2022) explores the way our motivation to see ourselves as morally\ngood may play a role in this lack of moral self-knowledge.\nExistentialist philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Sartre, in very\ndifferent ways, view self-deception as a threat to\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 insofar as self-deceivers fail to take\nresponsibility for themselves and their engagements in the past,\npresent, and future. By alienating us from our own principles,\nself-deception may also threaten moral integrity (Jenni 2003).\nMacKenzie (2022) might be seen as capturing precisely what\u2019s\nwrong with this sort of inauthenticity when she contends that we have\na duty to properly respect our values, even non-moral ones. Since\nself-deception is always about something we value in some way, it\nrepresents a failure to properly respect ourselves as valuers. Others\nnote that self-deception also manifests a certain weakness of\ncharacter that disposes us to react to fear, anxiety, or the desire\nfor pleasure in ways that bias our belief acquisition and retention in\nways that serve these emotions and desires rather than accuracy\n(Butler 1726; Clifford 1877). Such epistemic cowardice (Barnes 1997;\nJenni 2003) and lack of self-control may inhibit the ability of\nself-deceivers to stand by or apply moral principles they hold by\nbiasing their beliefs regarding particular circumstances,\nconsequences, or engagements or by obscuring the principles\nthemselves. Gibson (2020), following Clifford (1877), contends that\nself-deception increases the risk of harm to the self and others and\nthe cultivation of epistemic vices like credulity that may have\ndevastating social ramifications. In all these ways and a myriad of\nothers, philosophers have found some self-deception objectionable in\nitself or for the consequences it has, not only on our ability to\nshape our lives but also for the potential harm it may cause to\nourselves and others.\n\nEvaluating self-deception and its consequences for ourselves and\nothers is a difficult task. It requires, among other things:\ndetermining the degree of control self-deceivers have; what the\nself-deception is about (Is it important morally or otherwise?); what\nends the self-deception serves (Does it serve mental health or as a\ncover for moral wrongdoing?); how entrenched it is (Is it episodic or\nhabitual?); and, whether it is escapable (What means of correction are\navailable to the self-deceiver?). As Nelkin (2012) contends,\ndetermining whether and to what degree self-deceivers are culpably\nnegligent will ultimately need to be determined on a case-by-case\nbasis in light of answers to such questions about the stakes at play\nand the difficulty involved. Others like Mackenzie (2022) hold that\nevery case of self-deception is a violation of a general duty to\nrespect our own values, though some cases are more egregious than\nothers.\n\nIf self-deception is morally objectionable for any of these reasons,\nwe ought to avoid it. But, one might reasonably ask how that\nis possible given the subterranean ways self-deception seems to\noperate. Answering this question is tricky since strategies will vary\nwith the analyses of self-deception and our responsibility for it.\nNevertheless, two broad approaches seem to apply to most accounts,\nnamely, the cultivation of one\u2019s epistemic virtues and the\ncultivation of one\u2019s epistemic community (Galeotti 2016b). One\nmight avoid the self-deceptive effects of motivation by cultivating\nvirtues like impartiality, vigilance, conscientiousness, and\nresistance to the influence of emotion, desire, and the like.\nAdditionally, one might cultivate an epistemic community that holds\none accountable and guides one away from self-deception (Rorty 1994;\nGaleotti 2016b, 2018). By binding ourselves to communities we have\nauthorized to referee our belief formation in this way, we protect\nourselves from potential lapses in epistemic virtue. These kinds of\nstrategies might indirectly affect our susceptibility to\nself-deception and offer some hope of avoiding it.\n",
