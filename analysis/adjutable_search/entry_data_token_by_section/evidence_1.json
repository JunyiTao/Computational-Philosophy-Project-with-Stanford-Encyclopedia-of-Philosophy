Rational Thinkers Respect Their Evidence \n\nA rational man is one who makes a proper use of reason: and this\nimplies, among other things, that he correctly estimates the strength\nof evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Ayer, Probability and Evidence\n\n\nInsofar as we are rational in our beliefs, the intensity of belief\nwill tend to correspond to the firmness of the available\nevidence. Insofar as we are rational, we will drop a belief when we\nhave tried in vain to find evidence for it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Quine and Ullian, The Web of Belief\n\n\nA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding\n\n\n It is characteristic of rational thinkers to respect their evidence.\nInsofar as one is rational, one is disposed to respond appropriately\nto one's evidence: at any given time, one's views accurately reflect\nthe character of one's evidence at that time, and one's views manifest\na characteristic sensitivity or responsiveness to changes in one's\nevidence through time. Of course, rationality is no guarantee of\ncorrectness. Indeed, in a given case one might be led astray by\nfollowing one's evidence, as when one's evidence is\nmisleading.  But being mistaken is not the same as being\nunreasonable. To the extent that one respects one's evidence, one is\nnot unreasonable even when one is\n wrong.[9] \n\n The foregoing remarks, although bordering on the platitudinous,\nnaturally suggest a substantive model of the norms which govern our\npractice of belief attribution. According to the model in question, in\nattributing beliefs to you, I should, all else being equal, attribute\nto you the belief that p just in case it would be reasonable\nfor you to believe that p given your total evidence. This is\nthe core idea behind one popular version of the Principle of\nCharity. According to this line of thought, I am justified in drawing\ninferences about what you believe on the basis of my knowledge of your\nepistemic situation. Thus, if I know that your evidence strongly\nsuggests that it will rain today, then (all else being equal)\nI should attribute to you the belief that it will rain today. On the\nother hand, if I know that your evidence strongly suggests that it\nwill not rain today, then I should likewise attribute to you\na belief to that effect. Although on a given occasion a thinker who is\ngenerally reasonable might fail to believe in accordance with her\nevidence, such cases are exceptional. In the absence of any reason to\nthink that a given case is exceptional in this way, one is licensed to\ndraw inferences about the contents of another's beliefs on the basis\nof information about the character of her evidence. The default\nassumption is that a person's beliefs are those that it is appropriate\nfor her to hold given the evidence to which she has been exposed.\n\n Above, we noted that in a given case one might be led astray by\nfollowing one's evidence: even if p is true, one's evidence\nmight misleadingly suggest that p is not true. When one's\nevidence is misleading, one typically arrives at a false belief by\nbelieving in accordance with it. We ordinarily assume that such cases\nare exceptional. Are there possible worlds in which such cases are the\nnorm? Consider a careful and judicious thinker who consistently and\nscrupulously attends to his evidence in arriving at his beliefs. In\nour world, these habits lead to cognitive prosperity\u2014the\nindividual holds a relatively large number of true beliefs and\nrelatively few false beliefs. (Or at least, he fares significantly\nbetter with respect to truth and falsity than those who fail to attend\nto their evidence and instead form their beliefs in a hasty or\nhaphazard manner.)  Consider next how the same individual fares in a\nworld that is subject to the machinations of a Cartesian evil demon, a\nbeing bent on deceiving the world's inhabitants as to its true\ncharacter. Although the true character of the world in question\ndiffers radically from our own, it is, from the point of view of its\ninhabitants, utterly indistinguishable, for the Demon takes care to\nensure that the courses of experiences that the inhabitants undergo\nare qualitatively identical to the courses of experiences that they\nundergo in our non-delusory world. In the world run by the Cartesian\nDemon, our thinker is no less judicious and no less scrupulous in\nattending to (what he blamelessly takes to be) relevant considerations\nthan he is in our world. Because of his unfortunate circumstances,\nhowever, his beliefs embody a radically false picture of his\nenvironment. Granted that the thinker's beliefs about his environment\nare false, are they any less justified than in our world? Is the\nthinker himself any less rational? Many philosophers maintain that the\nthinker's beliefs are equally well-justified and that the thinker\nhimself is equally rational in the two worlds (See e.g., Cohen 1984\nand Pryor 2001). Apparently, there is strong intuitive resistance to\nthe idea that a thinker whose underlying dispositions and habits of\nthought remain unchanged might become less rational simply in\nvirtue of being located in less fortuitous circumstances. As\nWilliamson (2000) has forcefully emphasized, however, embracing the\njudgement that the thinker is equally rational in \u2018the good\ncase\u2019 and \u2018the bad case\u2019 tends to push one\ninexorably towards a conception of evidence according to which one's\nevidence is exhausted by one's subjective, non-factive mental\nstates. For if rationality is a matter of responding correctly to\none's evidence, then the judgement that the thinker is equally\nrational in the good case and the bad case would seem to require that\nthe thinker has the same evidence for his beliefs in both cases. But\nex hypothesi, the only thing common to the good case and the\nbad case that is a plausible candidate for being the thinker's\nevidence are his non-factive mental states. Thus, the judgement that\nthe thinker is equally rational in both cases, when conjoined with the\nview that rationality is a matter of responding to one's evidence in\nthe appropriate way, seems to force the conclusion that the thinker's\nevidence is limited to his non-factive mental states even in the\ngood case. In this way, the requirement that the thinker has the\nsame evidence in the good case and the bad case seems to encourage\nwhat Williamson calls \u2018the Phenomenal Conception of\n Evidence\u2019.[10]\n\n Consider also how the aforementioned Principle of Charity encourages\nsuch a picture of evidence when it is applied to the world run by the\nDemon. In attributing beliefs to an individual in the bad case, one\nattributes exactly those beliefs that one would attribute if the same\nindividual were in the good case. For if the Demon's illusions are\ntruly undetectable, failure to detect them hardly seems to constitute\na failure of rationality. In attributing commonsense beliefs\nto the individual in the bad case, one proceeds according to the\nPrinciple of Charity: after all, it seems that these are exactly the\nbeliefs that even a perfectly rational (though not infallible) being\nwould have in the circumstances. But if the commonsense beliefs are no\nless reasonable when held in the bad case, then the individual's\nevidence for those beliefs must be just as strong in the bad case as\nin the good case. Indeed, it is natural to describe the bad case as a\nworld in which the thinker's evidence is systematically\nmisleading. The trick to being a good Evil Demon (one\nmight think) is to be effective at planting misleading\nevidence. Intuitively, the Demon misleads his victims by\nexploiting their rationality, inasmuch as he trades on the\nsensitivity of their beliefs to misleading evidence. (Indeed, those\nwho dogmatically cling to favored theories in the face of apparently\ndisconfirming evidence would seem to be relatively less vulnerable to\nbeing manipulated by the Demon.) But the Demon misleads by providing\nhis victims with misleading experiences. Hence the temptation to\nsimply identify one's evidence with one's experiences: once again, the\nphenomenal conception of evidence looms. \n\n As Williamson emphasizes, the insistence that one's evidence is\nidentical in the good case and the bad case effectively rules out many\notherwise-attractive accounts of evidence:\n\n That one has the same evidence in the good and bad cases is a severe\nconstraint on the nature of evidence. It is inconsistent with the view\nthat evidence consists of true propositions like those standardly\noffered as evidence for scientific theories.\u2026 For similar\nreasons [it] does not permit my evidence to include perceptual states\nindividuated in part by relations to the environment. No matter how\nfavorable my epistemic circumstances, I am counted as having only as\nmuch evidence as I have in the corresponding skeptical scenarios, no\nmatter how distant and bizarre. Retinal stimulations and brain states\nfare no better as evidence, for in some skeptical scenarios they are\nunknowably different too (2000:173).\n \n\n In view of its apparent consequences for the theory of evidence, the\nidea that one's evidence is the same in the good case and the bad case\nwarrants further scrutiny. Again, it is uncontroversial that there is\na robust distinction between nonculpable error on the one hand and\nirrationality or unreasonableness on the other. Nonculpable error does\nnot in general make for irrationality, even when such error is\nrelatively widespread and pervasive. Still, it's worth asking just how\nmuch weight the distinction in question can bear. Is any amount of\nnonculpable error about the environment in which one is embedded\ncompatible with perfect rationality? Or rather, at some point, does a\nsufficient amount of error about one's environment tend to compromise\none's ability to form rational beliefs about that environment?\n\n Here is one line of thought for the conclusion that a sufficient\nlevel of nonculpable error about one's environment does tend\nto compromise one's ability to arrive at rational beliefs about that\nenvironment. It's plausible to suppose that much if not all of the\nvalue that we place on believing rationally depends on a connection\nbetween believing rationally and believing what is true (although the\nprecise nature of this connection is no doubt a particularly vexing\ntopic). One might worry that a view according to which even ideal,\nperfect rationality can coexist harmoniously with a more or less\ncompletely mistaken view of one's situation threatens to attenuate the\nconnection between believing rationally and believing truly too far,\nand to render obscure why the former would be valuable relative to the\nlatter. To put the same point in terms of evidence: plausibly, much if\nnot all of the value of respecting one's evidence consists in the\nputative link between doing so and believing the truth. Given this,\none might worry that a view according to which perfectly following\none's evidence is compatible with a more or less completely mistaken\nview of one's situation threatens to render obscure why following\none's evidence would be a good thing to do relative to the goal of\nhaving true rather than false beliefs.\n\n This line of thought is not decisive, however. In general, the value\nof x might consist in its serving as a means to y,\neven if there are conditions in which relying on x utterly\nfails to bring about (or even frustrates the achievement of)\ny. Thus, it might be that the value of a given drug consists\nin its being the miracle cure for some disease, even though in certain\nconditions the drug would have the effect of aggravating the disease.\nSimilarly, it might be that we value following our evidence as a means\nto believing what is true, even though we recognize that there are\ncircumstances such that, were we unfortunate enough to be in them,\ndoing so would hinder or frustrate that goal.\n\n A different tack is pursued by Williamson, who argues at length that\nwe should not accept the idea that one has the same evidence in the\ngood case and the bad case. Central to his argument is the contention\nthat, even if one were to adopt the phenomenal conception of evidence,\nthis would not allow one to vindicate the underlying intuitions that\nseemed to make its adoption attractive in the first place; hence, the\nphenomenal conception of evidence is ultimately not well-motivated. As\nwe have seen, it is the desire to preserve the intuition that a\nsufficiently scrupulous thinker in the bad case can be reasonable in\nhis beliefs (indeed, no less reasonable than a similarly scrupulous\nthinker in the good case) which seems to rule out any conception of\nevidence according to which one's evidence might consist of (say) true\npropositions or facts about the external world. For a thinker in the\nbad case is not in a position to recognize facts about the external\nworld; he is, however, in a position to recognize facts about his own\nexperiences. The view that one's evidence is limited to one's\nexperiences thus seems to be motivated by the idea that one's\nevidence, no matter what else is true of it, must be the sort of thing\nthat one is always in a position to correctly take into account, at\nleast in principle. But (it is claimed) one's experiences are the\nthings that one is always in a position to correctly take into\naccount. Williamson argues that this last thought is a mistake: in\nfact, one is not always in a position to correctly take into account\none's experiences, even in principle. Indeed, Williamson argues that\nthere is no non-trivial condition which is such that one is\nalways in a position to know that it obtains.  Thus, the thought that\nevidence might be such that one is always in a position to know what\none's evidence is is a chimerical one. To insist that in order for x\nto be among one's evidence, x must be such that one is always in a\nposition to know whether one's evidence includes x is thus to impose a\nmisguided and unrealizable desideratum on the theory of\nevidence. In short: \u2018Whatever evidence is, one is not\nalways in a position to know what one has of it\u2019 (2000: 178,\nemphasis added).\n\n Having\nrejected the phenomenal conception, Williamson proposes that we take a\nsubject's evidence to consist of all and only those propositions that\nthe subject\n knows.[11]\n Williamson elaborates this simple and straightforward idea with great\nsophistication; here we focus exclusively on the way in which the\nresulting theory interacts with the theme that rational thinkers\nrespect their evidence. Of course, one immediate consequence of the\nview that a subject's evidence consists of his knowledge is that a\nthinker in the good case and a thinker in the bad case will\ndiffer\u2014indeed, differ significantly\u2014in the evidence which\nthey possess.  When a thinker in the good case comes to know that\nthere is blood on the knife in virtue of having a visual\nexperience as of blood on the knife, the relevant proposition becomes\npart of his total evidence. In contrast, when a thinker in the bad\ncase is caused by the Demon to undergo the same experience (or at\nleast, an experience that is qualitatively indistinguishable) and\narrives at the same belief, the relevant proposition is not part of\nhis total evidence, for the relevant proposition is not true and hence\nnot known. Inasmuch as the scrupulous thinker in the good case will\nknow far more than the scrupulous thinker in the bad case, the former\nwill have far more evidence for his beliefs than the latter. Given\nthat the two thinkers have the same beliefs, it seems that the thinker\nin the good case will be significantly more reasonable in holding\nthose\n beliefs.[12] \n\n How much of a cost is this? We should distinguish between two\ndifferent intuitions one might have about a thinker in the bad\ncase. The first intuition is that a thinker in the bad case has\nexactly the same evidence as a thinker in the good\ncase. Perhaps abandoning this intuition is not much of a cost (if it\nis any cost at all). A different intuition is the following: when a\nthinker in the bad case takes his experiences at face value and forms\nbeliefs about the external world in the usual manner, those beliefs\nare not simply unreasonable, in the way that they would be if, for\nexample, the thinker adopted those same beliefs on a whim, or in the\nabsence of any reason to do so at all.  Abandoning this intuition\nwould seem to be a much heavier price to pay.  However, it is\ncontentious whether this intuition can be preserved on a view\naccording to which one's evidence consists of one's knowledge.\nConsider, once again, a thinker in the bad case who is caused by the\nDemon to have a visual experience as of being in the presence of a\nbloodied knife. Possessing no reason to doubt that the experience is\nveridical, the thinker forms the belief that there is blood on the\nknife in the usual manner. Intuitively, this belief is at the\nvery least better justified than it would be in the absence of the\nrelevant visual experience. On the supposition that one's evidence\nconsists of those propositions that one knows, we can ask: what known\nproposition or propositions justify this belief, to the extent that it\nis justified?  The proposition that there is blood on the knife is\nfalse and therefore not known. Perhaps the thinker's evidence for his\nbelief that there is blood on the knife is the true proposition that\n(i) it appears that there is blood on the knife or the true\nproposition that (ii) my experience is as of there being blood on\nthe\n knife.[13]\n However, some philosophers maintain that in typical cases of\nperception, one does not form beliefs about how things appear to one,\nor about how one's perceptual experience presents things as being:\nrather, in response to one's experiences, one simply forms beliefs\nabout the external world\n itself.[14]\n If this is correct, then, given that knowledge requires belief,\npropositions like (i) and (ii) are not known because they are not\nbelieved. Hence, if this model is correct, then, on the view that\none's evidence consists only of known propositions, the thinker's\nbelief that there is blood on the knife seems to lack any\n justification.[15]\n\n According to the phenomenal conception of evidence, only\none's experiences can serve as evidence. According to Williamson's\nconception of evidence as knowledge, one's experiences are excluded\nfrom counting as evidence\u2014at best, one's evidence includes\nwhatever propositions about one's experiences that one knows. Even if\none abandons the phenomenal conception of evidence, however, one might\nhold on to the idea that one's evidence includes one's\nexperiences, inasmuch as one's experiences can and often do make some\ndifference to what one is justified in believing, regardless of\nwhether one forms beliefs about those experiences themselves. A view\nof evidence that is more liberal than either Williamson's or the\nphenomenal conception might thus take one's evidence to include both\none's experiences and one's knowledge, on the grounds that the beliefs\nof a rational thinker will exhibit direct sensitivity both to what he\nknows and to the experiences that he undergoes. The question of\nwhether one's experiences\u2014as opposed to one's beliefs about\none's experiences, or one's knowledge of one's\nexperiences\u2014can play a direct role in justifying beliefs\nabout the external world is a much contested one in the philosophy of\nperception; it will not be pursued further here.\n\nAn issue that has recently come to the fore concerns the distinction\nbetween first-order evidence and higher-order\nevidence (Christensen 2010, Feldman 2005, Kelly 2005, 2010,\nLasonen-Aarnio 2014). Intuitively, first-order evidence E is\nevidence that bears directly on some target proposition or hypothesis\nH. Higher-order evidence is evidence about the character\nof E itself, or about subjects' capacities and dispositions for\nresponding rationally to E. Suppose that a trained\nmeteorologist carefully surveys the available meteorological data and\nconcludes that it will rain tomorrow. Here, the\nmeteorological data (E) is first-order evidence that bears on\nthe hypothesis (H), that it will rain tomorrow.  Now\nconsider the fact that the meteorologist arrived at the view that\nit will rain tomorrow on the basis of E. This fact is\nhigher-order evidence, inasmuch as it is evidence about the content\nand import of the original meteorological data E. In\nparticular, given that the meteorologist is generally competent when\nit comes to assessing the relevant kind of evidence, the fact that she\narrived at the view that H on the basis of E is evidence for\nthe epistemic propositions that E supports H. Moreover, at\nleast in many contexts, the fact that the meteorologist arrived at the\nview that H on the basis of E will count as evidence,\nnot only for the epistemic proposition that E supports H, but\nalso for the hypothesis itself, i.e., it will rain\ntomorrow. This seems especially clear in cases in which a third\nparty lacks access to the original meteorological evidence E\n(or is incompetent to assess that evidence) but does know that the\nmeteorologist arrived at the verdict that it will rain\ntomorrow on its basis. In these circumstances, it makes sense for\nthe third party to increase his credence in rain tomorrow, once he\nlearns what the meteorologist has concluded. In effect, in these\ncircumstances, one treats the fact that the meteorologist arrived at\nthe belief that it will rain tomorrow as a kind of proxy for\nthe meteorological evidence to which one lacks access, or which one is\nincompetent to assess (Kelly 2005). Here evidence of evidence\n(for H) is itself evidence for H (Feldman 2005). The\ngeneral lesson is that higher-order evidence sometimes serves as\nevidence that should make a difference not only to what one believes\nabout the first-order evidence, but also to one's beliefs about the\nworld itself.\n\nOther cases, however, are less clear-cut. For example, suppose that a\nsecond trained meteorologist evaluates the available meteorological\ndata E and arrives at her own view about the possibility that\nit will rain tomorrow. She then learns that the first meteorologist\narrived at the view that it will rain tomorrow on the basis of\nevidence E. Should the second meteorologist count her\ncolleague's opinion as additional evidence for the hypothesis\nthat it will rain tomorrow? Or would doing so be in effect to engage\nin a kind of illegitimate double counting of the original evidence\n(Kelly 2005, Matheson 2009)? More generally, in what circumstances,\nexactly, is evidence of evidence (for some proposition) evidence for\nthat proposition (Fitelson 2012, Feldman 2014)? Questions about the\nnature and bearing of higher-order evidence are topics of active\nresearch.\n",
