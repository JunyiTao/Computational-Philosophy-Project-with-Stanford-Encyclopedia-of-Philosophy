    "main_text": "Imagery\n5. Imagery\n\nThough imagery has played an important role in the history of\nphilosophy of mind, the important contemporary literature on it is\nprimarily psychological. (Tye 1991 and McGinn 2004 are notable recent\nexceptions.) In a series of psychological experiments done in the\n1970s (summarized in Kosslyn 1980 and Shepard and Cooper 1982),\nsubjects\u2019 response time in tasks involving mental manipulation\nand examination of presented figures was found to vary in proportion\nto the spatial properties (size, orientation, etc.) of the figures\npresented. The question of how these experimental results are to be\nexplained kindled a lively debate on the nature of imagery and\nimagination.\n\nKosslyn (1980) claims that the results suggest that the tasks were\naccomplished via the examination and manipulation of mental\nrepresentations that themselves have spatial properties \u2013 i.e.,\npictorial representations, or images. Others,\nprincipally Pylyshyn (1979, 1981a, 1981b, 2003), argue that the\nempirical facts can be explained in terms exclusively of\ndiscursive, or propositional representations and\ncognitive processes defined over them. (Pylyshyn takes such\nrepresentations to be sentences in a language of thought.)\n\nThe idea that pictorial representations are literally\npictures in the head is not taken seriously by proponents of\nthe pictorial view of imagery (see, e.g., Kosslyn and Pomerantz 1977).\nThe claim is, rather, that mental images represent in a way that is\nrelevantly like the way pictures represent. (Attention has\nbeen focused on visual imagery \u2013 hence the designation\n\u2018pictorial\u2019; though of course there may be imagery in\nother modalities \u2013 auditory, olfactory, etc. \u2013 as well.\nSee O\u2019Callaghan 2007 for discussion of auditory imagery.)\n\nThe distinction between pictorial and discursive representation can be\ncharacterized in terms of the distinction between analog and\ndigital representation (Goodman 1976). This distinction has\nitself been variously understood (Fodor & Pylyshyn 1981, Goodman\n1976, Haugeland 1981, Lewis 1971, McGinn 1989), though a widely\naccepted construal is that analog representation is continuous (i.e.,\nin virtue of continuously variable properties of the representation),\nwhile digital representation is discrete (i.e., in virtue of\nproperties a representation either has or doesn\u2019t have) (Dretske\n1981). (An analog/digital distinction may also be made with respect to\ncognitive processes. (Block 1983.)) On this understanding of\nthe analog/digital distinction, imagistic representations, which\nrepresent in virtue of properties that may vary continuously (such as\nbeing more or less bright, loud, vivid, etc.), would be analog, while\nconceptual representations, whose properties do not vary continuously\n(a thought cannot be more or less about Elvis: either it is or it is\nnot) would be digital.\n\nIt might be supposed that the pictorial/discursive distinction is best\nmade in terms of the phenomenal/non-phenomenal distinction, but it is\nnot obvious that this is the case. For one thing, there may be\nnon-phenomenal properties of representations that vary continuously.\nMoreover, there are ways of understanding pictorial representation\nthat presuppose neither phenomenality nor analogicity. According to\nKosslyn (1980, 1982, 1983), a mental representation is\n\u201cquasi-pictorial\u201d when every part of the representation\ncorresponds to a part of the object represented, and relative\ndistances between parts of the object represented are preserved among\nthe parts of the representation. But distances between parts of a\nrepresentation can be defined functionally rather than spatially\n\u2013 for example, in terms of the number of discrete computational\nsteps required to combine stored information about them. (Cf. Rey\n1981.)\n\nTye (1991) proposes a view of images on which they are hybrid\nrepresentations, consisting both of pictorial and discursive elements.\nOn Tye\u2019s account, images are \u201c(labeled) interpreted\nsymbol-filled arrays.\u201d The symbols represent discursively, while\ntheir arrangement in arrays has representational significance (the\nlocation of each \u201ccell\u201d in the array represents a specific\nviewer-centered 2-D location on the surface of the imagined\nobject).\n\nSee the entry on\n mental imagery\n for further discussion.\n",
