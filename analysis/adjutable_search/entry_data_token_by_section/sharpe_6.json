    "main_text": "Psychology and Theory of Knowledge\n8. Natural Philosophy: the Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics\n\nSharpe\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics (ms.\nOxford, New College 238, fols. 53r-208v) contains nine large\nquestions, one for each book of Aristotle\u2019s work, except for the\nfourth book to which two questions are dedicated, one concerning place\nand one time. Each question is divided into two main parts: in the\nfirst, Sharpe lists a series of arguments against the question itself\n(contra questionem in se), namely, in general, for supporting a\nnegative answer to the main question. In the second part, he expounds\nhis own opinion and refutes the arguments quod non.\n\nThe first question (fols. 53r-88v) is whether, from the point of view\nof the natural philosophy, material things have three constitutive\nprinciples only, that is: matter, form, and privation, or not.\nSharpe\u2019s answer is affirmative, but he points out that the\nconstitutive principles of material things are three by species and\nnot in number. Indeed, material things have more than three principles\nin number, but each of them is reducible to matter, or form, or\nprivation.\n\nThe second question (fols. 89r-128v) is whether there are four kinds\nof causes in the natural world or not. According to Sharpe, the\nefficient, formal, material, and final causes alone are properly\ncauses, while chance and fortune are accidental, and therefore\nimproper (per accidens) causes. \n\nThe third question (fols. 128v-143v) is whether motion (motus),\nwhich is an imperfect act of those beings that are in potentia\nto something, is the same item in essentia as action and\npassion. Before answering, Sharpe remarks that we can consider action\nand passion in two ways: either materially or formally. In the first\ncase, the answer is affirmative, since action and passion share the\nphysical reality of the motion itself. But formally conceived, action\nand passion are different from each other and from the motion, since\nthey are distinct relational properties (respectus) of the\nmotion.\n\nThe fourth question (fols. 144r-160r) is whether the immobile place of\na certain body is the ultimate surface of what that contains that body\nor not. According to Sharpe, it is false that the last surface of the\ncontaining body is absolutely immobile, as only the ninth and tenth\nheavens are such.\n\nThe fifth question (fols. 160v-175r), but second related to the fourth\nbook of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, is whether time is the\nmeasure of change in respect of the before and after. Sharpe\u2019s\nanswer is affirmative, as always, but he specifies that this is not\nproperly the definition of time, but rather the description of its\nnature. In his view, it follows from this description that (1) time\nmeasures mutable things only, but not immutable; and (2) time is\nclosely connected exclusively with that kind of motion which entails a\nbefore and an after.\n\nThe sixth question (fols. 175r-185r) is whether continuity and\ncontrariety of motion (continuitas et contrarietas motuum) are\npresent only in the categories of quantity, quality, and where. Sharpe\nthinks it is so, as only these three categories are properly\ncharacterized by the existence in them of distance. As a matter of\nfact, in these three categories are present sequences of items such\nthat in order to move from one term to the other of the series, it is\nnecessary to pass through intermediate terms.\n\nThe seventh question (fols. 185v-195r) is whether continuous physical\nmagnitudes are compounded by atomic elements not further divisible.\nSharpe\u2019s answer is negative, for continuous magnitudes are\ndivisible ad infinitum by definition.\n\nThe eight question (195v-201r) is whether, in order to compare two\nmotions belonging to the same genus (of motion), it is necessary that\nthe mover and the mobile be simultaneous. Sharpe\u2019s answer is\naffirmative, but he specifies that it is not always possible to\ncompare two motions belonging to the same genus. This is possible only\nwhen the motions that have to be compared belong to the same kind\n(species specialissima).\n\nThe last question (fols 201v-208v) is whether the perpetual motion of\nthe heavens depends on the prime mover or not. Sharpe\u2019s answer\nis affirmative and very short. Almost all of the second part of the\nquestion deals with the problem of the nature and properties of the\nprime mover.\n",
