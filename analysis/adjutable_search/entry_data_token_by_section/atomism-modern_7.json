    "main_text": "Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century || Dalton's Atomism\n4.1 Dalton's Atomism\n\n\nThe status of atomism underwent a transformation when John Dalton\nformulated his version of chemical atomism early in the nineteenth\ncentury. His atomic theory had implications for the way chemicals\ncombine by weight and, for the first time, it would seem, a direct\npath was uncovered that took scientists from experimental measurement\nto a property of atoms, namely, their relative weight. An assessment\nof the fruitfulness and epistemological status of Dalton's atomism can\neasily be distorted if we are uncritically influenced by the\nrecognition that Dalton's basic assumptions are in fact correct from a\nmodern point of view. This section will involve a summary of the basic\nfeatures of Dalton's chemistry as he published it in 1808 together\nwith the way in which its content can be usefully expressed using\nchemical formulae introduced by Berzelius five years later. The\nfollowing sections will explore, first the issue of the\nepistemological status of this early version and then the nature and\nstatus of subsequent elaborations of chemical atomism during the first\nhalf century of its life. These latter issues very much involve\ndevelopments in organic chemistry, issues that have been highlighted\nby historians of chemistry only in the last few decades.\n\n\nDalton was able to take for granted assumptions that had become\ncentral to chemistry since the work of Lavoisier. Chemical compounds\nwere understood as arising through the combination of chemical\nelements, substances that cannot be broken down into something simpler\nby chemical means. The weight of each element was understood to be\npreserved in chemical reactions. By the time Dalton (1808) made his\nfirst contributions to chemistry the law of constant composition of\ncompounds could be added to this. Proust had done much to substantiate\nexperimentally the claim that the relative weights of elements making\nup a chemical compound remain constant independent of its mode of\npreparation, its temperature and its state.\n\n\nThe key assumption of Dalton's chemical atomism is that chemical\nelements are composed of \u2018ultimate particles\u2019 or\natoms. The least part of a chemical compound is assumed to be made up\nof characteristic combinations of atoms of the component elements.\nDalton called these \u2018compound atoms\u2019. According to Dalton,\nall atoms of a given substance whether simple or compound, are alike\nin shape, weight and any other particular. This much already entails\nthe law of constant proportions. Although Dalton himself resisted the\nmove, Berzelius was able to show how Dalton's theory can be\nconveniently portrayed by representing the composition of compounds in\nterms of elements by chemical formulae in the way that has since\nbecome commonplace. Hereafter this device is employed using modern\nconventions rather than any of the various ones used by Berzelius and\nhis contemporaries,\n\n\nAs Dalton stressed, once the chemical atomic theory is accepted, the\npromise is opened up of determining the relative weights of atoms by\nmeasuring the relative weights of elements in compounds. If an atom of\nelement A combines with an atom of element B to form\na compound atom of compound AB, then the relative weights of\nA and B in the compound as measured in the\nlaboratory will be equal to the relative weights of atoms of\nA and B. However, there is a serious\nunder-determination of relative atomic weights by measurements of\ncombining weights in the laboratory. If the compound atom in our\nexample were A2B rather than AB\nthen the relative atomic weight of B would be twice what it\nwould be if the formula were AB. Dalton himself attempted to\nresolve this problem with a simplicity assumption. Formulae were\nalways to take the simplest form compatible with the empirical\ndata. If there was only one compound of A and B\nknown then it was assumed to be AB, whilst if there were two\nthen a more complicated compound, A2B or\nAB2 became necessary. As is illustrated by the\nlatter example, as well as the problem of the truth of the simplicity\nassumption there was the problem of its ambiguity. Chemical atomists\nwere to struggle for several decades with various solutions to the\nproblem of arriving at definitive formulae and relative atomic\nweights, as we shall see.\n\n\nThis deficiency of Dalton's atomism aside, links were forged between\nit and experimentally determined combining weights that went beyond\nthe law of constant proportions to include the laws of multiple and\nreciprocal proportions. If two elements combine together in more than\none way to form compounds, as is the case with the various oxides of\nnitrogen and carbon, for example, then Daltonian atomism predicts that\nthe weights of one of the elements in each compound, relative to a\nfixed weight of the second, will bear simple integral ratios to each\nother. This is the law of multiple proportions, predicted by Dalton\nand soon confirmed by a range of experiments. Daltonian atomism also\npredicts that if the weights of elements A and B\nthat combine with a fixed weight of element C are x\nand y respectively, then if A and B combine\nto form a compound then the relative weights of A and\nB in the compound will be in the ration x:y\nor some simple multiple of it. This law was also confirmed by\nexperiment.\n\n\nThere is a further component that needs to be added to the content of\nearly atomic chemistry, although it did not originate with Dalton, who\nin fact did not fully embrace it. Gay Lussac discovered experimentally\nthat when gases combine chemically they do so in volumes that bear an\nintegral ratio to each other and to the volume of the resulting\ncompound if gaseous, provided that all volumes are estimated at the\nsame temperature and pressure. For instance, one volume of oxygen\ncombines with two volumes of hydrogen to form two volumes of steam. If\none accepts atomism, this implies that there are some whole-number\nratios between the numbers per unit volume of atoms of various gaseous\nelements at the same temperature. Following suggestions made by\nAvogadro and Ampere early in the second decade of the nineteenth\ncentury, many chemists assumed that equal volumes of gases contain\nequal numbers of \u2018atoms\u2019, with the important implication\nthat relative weights of atoms could be established by comparing\nvapour densities. As Dalton clearly saw, this can only be maintained\nat the expense of admitting that \u2018atoms\u2019 can be split. The\nmeasured volumes involved in the formation of water, for example,\nentail that, if equal volumes contain equal numbers of atoms then a\nwater \u2018atom\u2019 must contain half of an oxygen\n\u2018atom\u2019. The resolution of these problems required a clear\ndistinction between atoms of a chemical substance and molecules of a\ngas, the grounds for which became available only later in the century.\nThis problem aside, the empirical fact that gases combine in volumes\nthat are in simple ratios to each other became a central component of\nchemistry, although it should be noted that at the time Gay Lussac\nproposed his law, only a small number of gases were known to chemists.\nThe situation was to change with the development of organic chemistry\nin the next few decades.\n",
