    "main_text": "Conceptions of certainty\n2. Conceptions of certainty\n\nThere have been many different conceptions of certainty. Each of them\ncaptures some central part of our intuitive understanding of\ncertainty, but, as we shall see, none of them is free from\nproblems.\n2.1 Indubitability\n\nCertainty is often explicated in terms of indubitability.\nThis has been done in a variety of ways (see, e.g., Goodman 1952;\nUnger 1978, p. 328). One prominent account of certainty is suggested\nby Descartes\u2019s presentation of his famous Archimedean point, the\ncogito (I am thinking, therefore I exist). In the Second\nMeditation, Descartes reviews the extensive doubts of the First\nMeditation before saying that even if \u201cthere is a deceiver of\nsupreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving\nme,\u201d still \u201che will never bring it about that I am nothing\nso long as I am something\u201d (PW 2, p. 17). Descartes then\nconcludes that the proposition that he himself exists is true whenever\nhe considers it. It is often thought that the cogito has a\nunique epistemic status in virtue of its ability to resist even the\n\u201chyperbolic\u201d doubts raised in the First Meditation (see\nMarkie 1992 and Broughton 2002). However, even if Descartes took this\nview of the certainty of the cogito, he did not accept the\ngeneral claim that certainty is grounded in indubitability. In the\nThird Meditation, Descartes says that he is certain that he is a\nthinking thing, and he explains the certainty of this \u201cfirst\nitem of knowledge\u201d (it is unclear whether he regards it as\ndistinct from the cogito) as resulting from the fact that it\nis a clear and distinct perception (PW 2, p. 24). (Matters are\ncomplicated, however, by the fact that Descartes also says in the\nThird Meditation that certainty depends on knowing that God exists and\nis not a deceiver.)\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein also seems to connect certainty with\nindubitability. He says that \u201cIf you tried to doubt everything\nyou would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting\nitself presupposes certainty\u201d (1969, \u00a7115). What makes\npossible doubting is \u201cthe fact that some propositions are exempt\nfrom doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn\u201d\n(1969, \u00a7341). Although Wittgenstein\u2019s view is sometimes\ntaken to be\u2014or to provide the basis for\u2014an epistemically\nsatisfying response to skepticism (see, e.g., Wright 2003 and 2004),\nit is hard to see the kind of certainty he has characterized as being\nepistemic, rather than merely psychological or moral, in nature (on\nthis point, see Pritchard 2005; Coliva 2010 and 2012). Thus, when\nWittgenstein says, \u201cThe difficulty is to realize the\ngroundlessness of our believing\u201d (1969, \u00a7166) it seems\nclear that the so-called hinge propositions are ones that we are\npsychologically incapable of calling into question. This is, of\ncourse, compatible with their being false.\n\nIn general, every indubitability account of certainty will face a\ndilemma: when the subject finds herself incapable of doubting one of\nher beliefs, either she has good reasons for being incapable of\ndoubting it, or she does not. If she does not have good reasons for\nbeing unable to doubt the belief, the type of certainty in question\ncan be only psychological, not epistemic, in nature. On the other\nhand, if the subject does have good reasons for being unable to doubt\nthe belief, the belief may be epistemically certain. But, in this\ncase, what grounds the certainty of the belief will be the\nsubject\u2019s reasons for holding it, and not the fact that the\nbelief is indubitable.\n\nA second problem for indubitability accounts of certainty is that, in\none sense, even beliefs that are epistemically certain can be\nreasonably doubted. I shall say more about this in \u00a73 below.\n2.2 Infallibility\n\nAccording to a second conception, a subject\u2019s belief is certain\njust in case it could not have been mistaken\u2014i.e.,\nfalse (see, e.g., Lewis 1929). Alternatively, the subject\u2019s\nbelief is certain when it is guaranteed to be true. This is\nwhat Roderick Firth calls the \u201ctruth-evaluating\u201d sense of\ncertainty (1967, pp. 7\u20138). As with knowing that p,\nbeing certain that p entails that it is true that p.\nCertainty is, however, significantly stronger than lesser forms of\nknowledge (contra Mizrahi 2019, who conflates knowledge with certainty\non the grounds that knowledge is factive). In cases where the subject\nknows without being certain that p, it is actually true that\np, though it could have been false. In that case, of course,\nthe subject would no longer know that p. But, where the\nsubject is certain that p, it does not merely turn out to be\ntrue that p\u2014in some sense it could not have been\notherwise.\n\nThe difficulty for this conception of certainty is specifying the\nprecise sense in which the belief could not have been false. What is\nmeant cannot be what is called metaphysical or broadly logical\nimpossibility. Although some of the paradigmatically certain beliefs\nare necessarily true in this sense, many others are not. For example,\nthough I am certain of the truth of the cogito, it is not\nnecessarily true (in the metaphysical sense) that I exist. That is, it\nis possible that I might not have existed. We might attempt to solve\nthis difficulty by saying that the belief is guaranteed to be true by\nthe subject\u2019s grounds for it (see, e.g., Audi 1998, pp.\n218\u20139). But this opens up two further problems for this\nconception of certainty. First, if the truth of the belief is\nguaranteed by the subject\u2019s grounds for holding it, then it\nlooks as though the certainty of the belief ought to be attributed to\nthose grounds as well. That is to say, the belief would be certain,\nnot in virtue of the fact that it is guaranteed to be true, but rather\nin virtue of its relation to the grounds that make that guarantee\npossible. This would be so because the grounds would provide a deeper\nexplanation for the certainty of the belief than would the fact that\nthe belief is guaranteed to be true. Moreover, some further account of\nthe certainty of the grounds will still need to be provided.\n\nThe second problem is very similar to one that arises for philosophers\nattempting to provide an account of fallibilistic knowledge (i.e.,\nknowledge that is less than certain). According to the standard\naccount, the subject has fallibilistic knowledge that p when\nshe knows that p on the basis of some justification\nj, and yet the subject\u2019s belief could have been false\nwhile still held on the basis of j (see, e.g., BonJour 1985,\np. 26; Lehrer 1990, p. 45). Alternatively, the subject knows that\np on the basis of some justification j, but\nj does not entail the truth that p (see, e.g., Cohen\n1988, p. 91; Fogelin 1994, pp. 88\u20139; Jeshion 2000, pp.\n334\u20135; Brown 2018, pp. 15\u201321). The problem with the\nstandard account, in either version, is that it does not allow for\nfallibilistic knowledge of necessary truths. If it is necessarily true\nthat p, then the subject\u2019s belief that p could\nnot have been false, regardless of what her justification for it may\nbe like. And, if it is necessarily true that p, then\neverything\u2014including the subject\u2019s justification for her\nbelief\u2014will entail or guarantee that p. Our attempt to\naccount for certainty encounters the opposite problem: it does not\nallow for a subject to have a belief regarding a necessary truth that\ndoes not count as certain. If the belief is necessarily true,\nit cannot be false\u2014even when the subject has come to hold the\nbelief for a very bad reason (say, as the result of guessing or\nwishful thinking). And, given that the beliefs are necessarily true,\neven these bad grounds for holding the belief will entail or guarantee\nthat it is true.\n\nOne way to solve the problem for the analysis of fallibilistic\nknowledge is to focus, not on the entailment relation, but rather on\nthe probabilistic relation holding between the subject\u2019s\njustification and the proposition believed (see Reed 2002 and 2013).\nWhen the subject knows that p on the basis of justification\nj, and P(p/j) is less than 1, the\nsubject\u2019s knowledge is fallibilistic. (Although epistemologists\nwill disagree about what the appropriate conception of probability is,\nhere is a crude example of how probability may figure in a\nfallibilistic epistemology. A basic historical reliabilist will say\nthat a belief is justified just in case it has been produced by a\nprocess that has yielded a preponderance of true beliefs. So, if the\nprocess has yielded a true belief, say, 90% of the time, the\nprobability that the next belief will be true is 90%; this is so even\nif the belief in question is necessarily true and has been logically\ndeduced from a set of beliefs, each of which is necessarily true.)\nAdapting this solution to the problem for certainty, we can say that\nthe subject is certain that p when\nP(p/j) = 1, where j is the\njustification or grounds for the belief (see Van Cleve 1977 and Lewis\n1952). However, in order for j to impart a probability of 1\nto p, it must also be the case that P(j) =\n1. That is to say, j must be certain for the subject before\nit can make anything else certain. But, if we are to explain the\ncertainty that p by appeal to the certainty that j,\nwe fall into a vicious regress. The only way to stop it is to allow\nthat some beliefs may have an intrinsic probability of 1 (see Russell\n1948, p. 396, and Van Cleve 1977). It is, however, difficult to see\nhow intrinsic probability of this sort is possible (barring, of\ncourse, a subjectivist account of probability, which could, in any\ncase, capture only psychological certainty).\n\nTimothy Williamson (2000, pp. 213\u20137) rejects the connection\nbetween a belief having probability 1 and its being absolutely\ncertain. (On his view, one\u2019s evidence is identical with what one\nknows, so what one knows will be evidence for itself. In a trivial\nsense, then, everything one knows will have probability 1.) He argues\nthat the connection can be broken by denying that beliefs that have\nprobability 1 at a particular time will always thereafter remain at\nthat probability. Further evidence may be acquired that destroys the\nknowledge in question; when that happens, it is no longer evidence,\nlet alone evidence for itself. Williamson finds this result congenial\nbecause, he says, \u201cit is hard to see\nhow any empirical proposition could have the\nintertemporal and intersubjective certainty which the\nconditionalization account demands of evidence\u201d (p. 215). In breaking\nthe connection between certainty and probability 1, then, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that Williamson has done so only for\nabsolute certainty (or certainty over time), but not for certainty at\na time. See\n section 3 below\n for more on the distinction between these two dimensions of\ncertainty.\n2.3 Inimitability\n\nAccording to a third conception of certainty, a subject\u2019s belief\nthat p is certain when it is\ninimitable--i.e., justified in the highest degree (see,\ne.g., Stanley 2008). This is what Firth calls the\n\u201cwarrant-evaluating\u201d sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n8\u201312). Thus, Bertrand Russell says that \u201cA proposition is\ncertain when it has the highest degree of credibility, either\nintrinsically or as a result of argument\u201d (1948, p. 396). There\nare various ways to understand what it means for a belief to be\ncredible or justified in the highest degree. It could mean simply that\nthe belief in question is justified as highly as any belief the\nsubject happens to hold. But, in cases where the subject does not have\nany beliefs that are highly justified, this will imply that even a\nbelief with relatively low justification is epistemically certain.\nPerhaps we could say instead that a belief is justified to the highest\ndegree when it is justified as highly as any belief that\nanyone happens to hold. But this, too, leaves open the\npossibility that a belief with relatively low justification is\nepistemically certain: if all the subjects in existence are in a\ncondition of universal ignorance, all of their beliefs\u2014including\nthe best of them\u2014will have only a low level of justification.\nPerhaps, then, we should say that a belief is justified in the highest\ndegree when it has the highest level of justification\npossible. But even this account is unsatisfactory. Suppose\nthat global skepticism is necessarily true: it is a necessary truth\nthat no subject is capable of having much justification for any of her\nbeliefs; although it may seem to us as though a significant degree of\njustification is possible, this in fact is incorrect. It would then be\nintuitively correct to say that every belief falls far short of\ncertainty, though this would not be permitted by the account of\ncertainty under consideration. We may of course doubt that skepticism\nof this strong variety is correct; nevertheless, it should not be\nsimply ruled out as a matter of definition.\n\nRoderick Chisholm offers a variation on the above approach. According\nto his first definition of certainty (where h, S,\nand t are variables for propositions, subjects, and times,\nrespectively):\n\nh is certain for S at t =df (i)\nAccepting h is more reasonable for S at t\nthan withholding h (i.e., not accepting h and not\naccepting not-h) and (ii) there is no i such that\naccepting i is more reasonable for S at t\nthan accepting h. (1976, p. 27)\n\n\nClause (i) ensures that the subject has some measure of positive\njustification for h\u2014if she had no justification for it,\nit would be more reasonable for her to withhold with respect to\nh. Clause (ii) then says that those beliefs of the subject\nare certain which are at the highest levels of justification for her.\nHowever, this still leaves open the following possibility: h\nis the most highly justified belief the subject has, but it is still\nnot very highly justified (e.g., it may not even be sufficiently\njustified to count as knowledge).\n\nPerhaps for this reason, Chisholm later offered a different definition\nof certainty:\n\np is certain for S =df For every\nq, believing p is more justified for S than\nwithholding q, and believing p is at least as\njustified for S as is believing q. (1989, p. 12)\n\n\nThis definition still has the equivalent of clause (ii) above, and\ntherefore requires the belief that is certain for the subject be the\none that is most highly justified for her. But the second definition\nappears to be more successful in requiring that p be\njustified to a significant degree. Now, believing that p must\nnot only be more justified for the subject than withholding\np, it must also be more justified than withholding with\nrespect to any other proposition. There are many propositions that we\nare capable of entertaining\u2014e.g., the proposition that the\nnumber of people alive at this precise moment is even\u2014where\nthere is not the slightest reason for thinking them to be either true\nor false (though, of course, they must be one or the other). In fact,\ngiven the perfect lack of evidence with respect to propositions of\nthis sort, Chisholm\u2019s definition may set the standard for\ncertainty too high, for it is hard to see how there could be\nany proposition one is more justified in believing than one\nis in withholding belief regarding, say, the parity of the number of\npeople alive at this very moment.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Chisholm\u2019s definition works\nonly by implicitly relying on what is a contingent feature of our\nepistemic situation. It so happens that we find ourselves in a\nposition of total ignorance with respect to some propositions. But\nthat need not have been the case. We could have ended up in a world\nwhere there is a moderate amount of evidence either for or against\nevery proposition. If one of a subject\u2019s beliefs then happened\nto have slightly more justification than any of the others, it would\nmeet Chisholm\u2019s definition of certainty, though it might still\nhave what we would intuitively take to be a less than ideal level of\njustification.\n\nThere is one further problem with both of Chisholm\u2019s\ndefinitions. Because they both relativize certainty to a particular\nsubject, they make possible the following situation. Two subjects each\nbelieve that p, and in each case the belief is justified to\ndegree n. For the first subject, the belief counts as certain\nbecause none of her other beliefs have a higher level of\njustification. But, for the second subject, the belief in question is\nnot certain because she does have another belief that is slightly more\njustified. If certainty really is grounded in epistemic justification,\nthough, this should not be possible. If a given justification makes a\nbelief certain for one subject, it should do so for everyone.\n\nThere is another approach that Chisholm might take. According to\nparticularism, his favored method in epistemology, we should\nuse particular instances of knowledge and justification as our guide\nin formulating an epistemology (Chisholm 1973 and 1989, pp.\n6\u20137). (By contrast, methodism begins with criteria for\nknowledge and justification and then attempts to ascertain whether, on\nthese criteria, we actually have any knowledge or justified beliefs.)\nAdapting this approach to our present concern, the suggestion is that\nwe formulate an account of certainty in light of paradigmatic\ninstances of beliefs held with certainty. Thus, after giving the\nsecond definition above, Chisholm says that the concept of certainty\nis illustrated by propositions about what he calls\n\u201cself-presenting\u201d mental states and by some logical and\nmetaphysical axioms (1989, p. 12).\n\nAlthough this particularist approach probably is the way in which most\nphilosophers think of certainty, it faces several difficulties. One is\nthat the epistemology of the a priori is far from clear.\nGiven that we do not, apparently, causally interact with necessary\ntruths, it is hard to see how our minds can have access to them. A\nsecond difficulty has to do with knowledge of our own mental\nstates\u2014sometimes referred to as knowledge by\nacquaintance. According to the \u201cspeckled hen\u201d\nproblem, there are aspects of our mental states, such as the rich\ndetail of one\u2019s present visual experience, that we are not\ncapable of knowing\u2014e.g., if one is looking at a speckled hen,\nthere will be a determinate number of speckles in one\u2019s visual\nexperience, which one will not be able to know just in virtue of\nhaving the experience (Ayer 1940, Chisholm 1989, Fumerton 2005). But\nthose aspects we cannot know merely by being conscious of them are\npart of our conscious experience in just the same way as those aspects\nwe are supposed to be able to know; the difficulty is\nspecifying a principled difference between the two. Much more could be\nsaid about the first two problems, but they lie beyond the scope of\nthis article. A third difficulty is that, at least prima\nfacie, knowledge of one\u2019s mental states seems to be of a\nfairly different kind from knowledge of necessary truths. It is not\nclear, at the outset, that we are warranted in taking them to be\nparadigmatic instances of a genuine epistemological kind.\n2.4 Indefeasibility\n\nAccording to a fourth conception of certainty, defended by Peter\nKlein, a belief \u201cis absolutely certain just in case it is\nsubjectively and objectively immune to doubt\u201d\n(1992, p. 63; see also Miller 1978). He explicates this in the\nfollowing way:\n\np is absolutely certain for S if and only if (1)\np is warranted for S and (2) S is warranted\nin denying every proposition, g, such that if g is\nadded to S\u2019s beliefs, the warrant for p is\nreduced (even if only very slightly) and (3) there is no true\nproposition, d, such that if d is added to\nS\u2019s true beliefs the warrant for p is reduced\n(even if only very slightly). (1992, p. 63)\n\n\nKlein says that the second condition is what makes the belief\nsubjectively immune to doubt, presumably because it is the beliefs and\nexperiences that constitute S\u2019s subjective perspective\nthat render her warranted in denying all propositions that would\nreduce the warrant for p. However, S\u2019s belief\nsystem might contain false beliefs that could warrant her in denying\nevery g relevant to p\u2014even, in some cases,\nwhere the g in question is itself true\u2014and so her\nbelief that p might meet condition (2) and yet still be\nfalse. Condition (3) is meant to prevent this situation; if p\nis false, the true belief that ~p can be added to\nS\u2019s belief system, thereby reducing the warrant\nS has for p. In requiring both (2) and (3), then,\nthe account focuses on beliefs where the subject\u2019s subjective\nsituation is in a sense properly aligned with an objective structure\nof reasons (for a similar view, see Pollock 1986).\n\nThere are two major difficulties facing a view of this sort. First, it\nis not clear how one belief is supposed to reduce the warrant for\nanother. Suppose that I correctly believe that I have a headache and\nthat my belief is, in an intuitive sense, absolutely certain. The\nfirst condition of Klein\u2019s account is satisfied: the belief is\nwarranted in virtue of my experiencing the headache. But is the second\ncondition also satisfied? That is, would I be warranted in denying,\nsay, the proposition that I do not in fact have a headache? If this\nwere to be a belief added to my belief system, I would of course have\ncontradictory beliefs. Would that entail that the warrant for both\nbeliefs should be diminished? If the answer is yes, then my belief\nthat I have a headache is not absolutely certain. Moreover, it is hard\nto see how any belief could then be absolutely certain, given\nthat we can always add to our belief systems the contradictory of any\nof our beliefs. If the answer is no, however, there should be some\nexplanation for why the proposition that I do not have a headache can\nbe denied. Presumably, the explanation would have something to do with\nmy experiencing the headache. But then what explains the certainty of\nthe belief is the fact that it is grounded in the experience; the\nbelief\u2019s being subjectively immune to doubt is merely a\nconsequence of its certainty, and not the explanation for it. This\nwould mean that the focus of the view has shifted from subjective\nimmunity to doubt to some sort of special warrant. How there could be\nsuch a special warrant, though, would need an account. To see the\npoint more clearly, notice that subjective immunity to doubt will be\npossible only in cases where the subject\u2019s belief is\n(intuitively) absolutely certain. For any belief b that is\nless than certain, the following belief could be added to the\nsubject\u2019s belief system: the warrant for b could be\nmisleading. That belief would reduce the subject\u2019s warrant for\nb (even if only slightly) were it to be added to her belief\nsystem, but it is not a proposition the subject can deny without being\nabsolutely certain that b is true. The upshot, then, is that\nsubjective immunity to doubt is not well-suited to playing a role in\nan account of certainty. Instead, it looks as though our understanding\nof subjective immunity to doubt depends on a prior grasp of what\ncertainty is.\n\nThe second difficulty has to do with condition (3), which is supposed\nto secure objective immunity to doubt. Although it is undeniable that\na subject for whom condition (3) is satisfied would be in a desirable\nsituation, it does not seem to be attributable to her in the right\nsort of way\u2014and, especially, not in the way that we expect\ncertainty to be attributable to the person who is certain. To see\nthis, suppose that my warrant for the belief that p is only\nmoderately good. Nevertheless, my guardian angel protects my belief by\nmaking sure that any proposition such that, if it were true, would\n(when added to my belief system) reduce my warrant for p, is\nfalse. That is, my guardian angel makes sure that all potential\ndefeaters for my belief are removed. Suppose, for example, that I see\nfrom a great distance what looks like a hawk. My guardian angel\nimmediately annihilates all non-hawk flying objects in the area; the\npotential defeater, that there are flying objects indistinguishable\nfrom a hawk in the vicinity, has thus been rendered false. Although\nthis would make my belief that p objectively immune to doubt,\ninsofar as (3) is satisfied, it does not seem as though it would carry\nmy belief any closer to certainty. The fact that the warrant for my\nbelief is only moderately good renders irrelevant the work my guardian\nangel does in the world outsid of my beliefs. (Nor would the situation\nbe helped if we stipulated that condition (2) is also satisfied. Given\nthat my belief system could contain many false beliefs that might\nwarrant me in rejecting all potential defeaters, my belief might be\nboth subjectively and objectively immune to doubt\u2014and yet still\nhave a relatively low degree of warrant.)\n\nIt may be that one of the four conceptions of certainty discussed\nabove could be improved so as to answer all objections. But, until\nthat happens, it is safe to say that there is at present no completely\nsatisfactory conception of certainty.\n",
