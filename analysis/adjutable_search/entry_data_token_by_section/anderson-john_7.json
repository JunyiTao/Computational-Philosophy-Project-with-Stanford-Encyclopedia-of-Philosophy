    "main_text": "Specific Fields || Ethics\n5.4 Ethics\n\n\u201cWe do not, in fact, step out of the movement of things, ask\n\u2018What am I to do?\u2019 and, having obtained an answer, step in\nagain. All our actions, all our questionings and answerings, are part\nof the movement of things.\u201d (EMP, 241). \n\nPositive ethical inquiry for Anderson is concerned with the\nidentification of good as a natural quality and he finds that this\nmost naturally pertains to certain actually existing practices and\nways of living in the world of common experience. Traditionally the\ngood has been identified abstractly as an end to be achieved or aimed\nfor, either as a transcendent reality to which we can only aspire (but\nwhich in some unexplained way is supposed to guide our moral actions)\nor as an end external to our actions in the real world and by which\nthose actions may be evaluated; for example, some optimal quantum of\nhappiness or welfare for the greatest number of people involved. In\neither case, a relational explanation is mistakenly offered in place\nof identifying a real quality. This has been the problem with\nvirtually all moral thought since the Greeks, although Anderson\nthought that G. E. Moore had made important advances in our thinking\non these matters. Anderson proposes that the good exists in forms of\nenterprise, productive activities capable of developing in a special\nway by means of \u201ccommunication\u201d \u2013 individuals are\ncaught up in these goods and in the process transcend their more\nimmediate and mundane goals and demands. Any theory of social life\nmust take account of activities with no formulated end: customs,\nregular forms of behaviour, and practices which precede the\nformulation of ends (JAA, Philosophical Implications\nof Marxism, 1945).\n\nValues have objective reality, but not in a transcendent realm\ndivorced from this world of facts or states of affairs. Anderson\nagrees that \u201cthe way things are\u201d includes moral facts:\n\u201cit is impossible to discuss social processes except in terms of\nways of living or forms of enterprise, and that is moral\ncharacterisation\u201d (EMP, 330). But he cannot\naccept that moral characterisation entails moral prescription because\nthis would commit us to a morality of commands, and to programmes for\naction and reform designed to achieve a merely external good. The\nimportance of ethical inquiry is in giving an account of\nproductive activities which entail the operation of a certain\nmentality or spirit. Within such activities there is no question of\nexternal ends or rewards to be achieved. Goodness exists in free,\nspontaneous participation in such movements and activities (although\nnot of course in the metaphysical sense of undetermined free will\n\u2013 such practices, social movements and ways of life are not\nthings we as individuals \u201copt into\u201d at will; they in a\nsense adopt us). Acting because we feel obliged so\nto act is on this view an indication of the absence of\ngoodness. Although the notion of \u201cvirtue\u201d does not much\nappeal to him, Anderson\u2019s emphasis upon the transformative role\nof practices and ways of life upon the ethical outlook of the\nindividual does seem to accord with many of the major preoccupations\nof virtue ethicists. Alasdair Macintyre recognises the value to\ncontemporary Aristotelian virtue ethics of Anderson\u2019s\nHeraclitean appreciation of conflict and the importance he attributes\nto critical traditions (Macintyre 1981).\n\nEthics is especially concerned to bring out the facts of conflict, the\nopposition of different strains in things in general, but in human and\nmental life most particularly. The category of causality is central to\nthe ethical sphere \u2013 false views of causality represent the\nattempt to escape conflict, to gain a standpoint above that of strife\nand interlocking tensions (JAA, Lectures on\nCriticism, 1954). Positive ethics exhibits the good life as constantly\nstruggling with difficulties and other types of life driven by\nexternal or instrumental considerations (JAA,\nLectures on Greek Theories of Education, 1954). The good exists in\nstruggle and so cannot be made secure (JAA,\nPhilosophy I Lectures, 1943). In all spheres of life the good can only\nmake its stand. Attempts at reconciliation and compromise often\nobscure the issues and may well prove detrimental to the good. The\nresulting Heraclitean harmony is best served by this stance of\nindependence and intransigence.\n\nSociological inquiry is appropriate for the bulk of traditional moral\nterms. Forms of social organisation develop regular habits of action\nwhich come to be seen as obligatory: rights, duties and so forth are\neasily understood by those involved in the same way of life. Bourgeois\nsociety is based on commodification and contractual relations. The\nmarket destroys folk life and with it one important source by which\nculture can be refreshed (JAA, Lectures on Marx,\n1950). Marxism has made important advances in this area but Anderson\nnotes the \u201csimple-mindedness\u201d of most Marxists on moral\nquestions \u2013 altruism seems to be the peak of their thinking\nabout morality (Cf., remarks on Kautsky, EMP, 321)\nand little consideration is given to the importance of a plurality of\nways of living.\n\nParticipation in disinterested activities represents the ethical value\nof \u201cdevotion to a cause\u201d. Anderson even offers a\nsociological interpretation of sin as a person\u2019s sense of\ninadequacy to social movements, one\u2019s inability to keep the flag\nflying, to devote oneself thoroughly to these kinds of activity. Sin\nappears then as a kind of backsliding and subjectivism: the individual\nsetting him or herself up as the standard. Anderson was opposed to all\nforms of religious instruction and interference in educational\npractice, but he occasionally shocked his students with a\nquasi-theological appreciation of the existence of evil in the world.\nPassmore commented that forms of religion that emphasise that our life\nis not of our making and that it goes on independently of our plans,\nare far more preferable in Anderson\u2019s view to any form of\nsecular sentimental humanism (Passmore, Introduction to\nEMP).\n\nJ. L. Mackie regarded Anderson\u2019s positive conception of goods as\nbeing \u201chopeless as an account of moral talk and reasoning\u201d\n(Mackie 1985). However, despite being one of the current standard\nbearers for anti-realism in ethics the manner in which Mackie posed\nthe question of the subjectivity of values owes much to\nAnderson\u2019s ontological standpoint. Mackie seemed at pains to\nexplain that his subjectivist view of ethical terms complied with\nAnderson\u2019s main concern. Subjectivism in ethics is for Mackie\nthe doctrine that objective facts in this field do not include any\ndescriptive assignment of goodness or rightness of actions. It is\n\u201cprecisely because we want to distinguish what is simply and\nabsolutely the case that we say values/obligations are\nrelative.\u201d (Mackie 1985). Mackie suggested that linguistic\nphilosophy had made the realist-antirealist opposition a philosophical\npseudo-question, and that with renewed interest in ontological issues\nthis opposition returned in a pressing form in the\n\u201cplacement\u201d issue regarding various \u201cqueer\u201d\nentities in the world.\n\nRush Rhees was a student of Anderson\u2019s at Edinburgh and, of\ncourse, later of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s. Like Mackie, he was\ncritical of Anderson\u2019s ethical theory, but from the other pole\nin that he was more inclined towards Anderson\u2019s positive view of\nethics. He regarded Anderson\u2019s notion of a \u201cway of\nlife\u201d as at some level the same as Wittgenstein\u2019s (Rhees\n1969). But he came to think that Anderson paid too little attention to\nthe ways in which moral questions are posed for individuals, that\nAnderson too readily portrayed individual concerns as base,\negocentric, low concerns in contrast with the uplifting concerns\nresulting from participation in social movements. Anderson, Rhees\nconcluded, had no appreciation for the urgency with which moral\nquestions presented themselves to individuals (Rhees 1999, p. xiii),\nnor their distinctive character compared to more practical questions\nof how to go on. However, Rhees always emphasised the Andersonian\nlesson that values are rooted in different traditions and movements.\nWe have to resist the temptation to locate values in a realm which\ntranscends these contexts. It is futile to argue that the moral\nindividual is located in a realm outside history, outside the\nparticularities of space and time. Only in these contexts do the\nindividual\u2019s convictions, problems, struggles and difficulties\nhave their sense. Resources for criticism of moral codes exist within\nmovements, and criticism develops only within ways of living. Notions\nof the \u201ccommon good\u201d generally conceal special interests\n(Rhees 1989, p. 53).\n",
