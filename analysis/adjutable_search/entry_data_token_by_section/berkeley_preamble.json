    "main_text": "\n\n\nGeorge Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, was one of the great philosophers\nof the early modern period. He was a brilliant critic of his\npredecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke. He was a\ntalented metaphysician famous for defending idealism, that is, the\nview that reality consists exclusively of minds and their\nideas. Berkeley\u2019s system, while it strikes many as counter-intuitive,\nis strong and flexible enough to counter most objections. His\nmost-studied works, the Treatise Concerning the Principles of\nHuman Knowledge (Principles, for short) and Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), are\nbeautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delight\ncontemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker with\ninterests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophical\nmotivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,\neconomics, and medicine.  Although many of Berkeley\u2019s first readers\ngreeted him with incomprehension, he influenced both Hume and Kant,\nand is much read (if little followed) in our own day.\n",
