    "main_text": "Criticisms\n5. A Revisionist View?\n\nSome modern commentators appreciate in Austin elements that were\nprobably not foremost in his mind (or that of his contemporary\nreaders). For example, one occasionally sees Austin portrayed as the\nfirst \u201crealist\u201d: in contrast both to the theorists that\ncame before Austin and to some modern writers on law, Austin is seen\nas having a keener sense of the connection of law and power, and the\nimportance of keeping that connection at the forefront of analysis\n(cf. Cotterrell 2003: pp. 49\u201377). One commentator wrote:\n\nAustin\u2019s theory is not a theory of the Rule of Law: of\ngovernment subject to law. It is a theory of the \u2018rule of\nmen\u2019: of government using law as an instrument of power. Such a\nview may be considered realistic or merely cynical. But it is, in its\nbroad outlines, essentially coherent. (Cotterrell 2003: p. 70)\n\n\nWhen circumstances seem to warrant a more critical, skeptical or\ncynical approach to law and government, Austin\u2019s equation of law\nand force will be attractive\u2014however distant such a reading may\nbe from Austin\u2019s own liberal-utilitarian views at the time of\nhis writing, or his more conservative political views later in his\nlife (Hamburger, 1985).\n",
