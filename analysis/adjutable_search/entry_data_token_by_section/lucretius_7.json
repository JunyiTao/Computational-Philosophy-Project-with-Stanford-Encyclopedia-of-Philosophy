    "main_text": "Religion\n8. Influence and reception\n\nWhether or not Lucretius operated on the margins of the Roman world,\nthere is no doubt that by the next generation, in poetry at least, his\nwork became mainstream and his influence extensive (Hardie 2009). In\nimperial Latin prose, with the exception of Seneca in his Natural\nQuestions, he is mainly discussed as a\npoet. His transformation into a philosophical source for\nEpicureanism is first seen in the hostile Lactantius and the more\nambivalent Arnobius (Gatzemeier 2013). In Latin poetry he was read\ncontinuously until the end of antiquity (Hardie 2020); his presence in\nlate antique Latin prose remains largely unexplored.\n\nThe DRN reached us through two 9th century\nCarolingian manuscripts both now in Leiden, O and Q (on the early\ntextual history and for discussion of the unusual\n\u2018capitula\u2019 see Butterfield 2013). Lucretius re-entered\ncirculation when he was rediscovered in 1417 by the papal secretary\nPoggio Bracciolini (on the story of that discovery, Greenblatt 2011).\nLater in the same generation the migration of Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nLives of the Philosophers to Italy, followed by its\ntranslation into Latin and various first printings, allowed Epicurean\nideas to be studied first-hand and eventually play a leading but\nhardly exclusive role in the scientific revolution and the rise of\nearly modern moral thought, especially social contract theories (on\nRenaissance dissemination, Palmer 2014 and 2020; on the influence of\nideas, Wilson 2008). Lucretius\u2019 early modern reception is now a\nflourishing scholarly enterprise and most recent collections of essays\non Lucretius have a substantial section devoted to this aspect (for a\nstart, see Gillespie and Hardie 2007 and Mitsis 2020). Though\nEpicurean ideas were suspect, and an easy label for accusations of\natheism and crude hedonism, the DRN was never put on the\nIndex of banned books, so long as it was kept among the learned. But\nearly translations into vernacular languages were banned (Prosperi\n2020). Many of Lucretius\u2019 most open humanist critics were also\nhis best students and editors. Denys Lambin\u2019s watershed 1563\nedition and commentary praises Lucretius as the \u2018sweetest\u2019\nof all Roman poets but points out the \u2018correct\u2019\nAristotelian answer for every Lucretian-Epicurean departure. Montaigne\nstudied Lucretius intently and used the DRN as a regular\nquarry for arguments, see for example the presence of book 3 in his\nessay \u2018Que philosopher, c\u2019est apprendre \u00e0 mourir.\u2019\nPierre Gassendi\u2019s Christianity-compatible atomism, built up out\nof Lucretius and Book 10 of Diogenes Laertius, did more to\nre-establish empiricism and attack Aristotelianism than produce much\nin the way of atomism-based science, although it did open up\ntheoretical space for later scientists, in Britain more so than in\nFrance (Jones 1989).\n",
