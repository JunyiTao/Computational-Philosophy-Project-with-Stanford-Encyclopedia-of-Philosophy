Tropes as Building Blocks\n\nAs we have seen, tropes can be conceptualized, not just as\nparticularized ways things are, but also\u2014and on some\nversions of trope theory, primarily\u2014as that out of which\neverything else there is, is constructed. Minimally, this means that\ntropes must fulfill at least two constructive tasks: that of making up\n(the equivalent of) the realist\u2019s universal, and that of making\nup (the equivalent of) the nominalist\u2019s concrete particular.\n",
