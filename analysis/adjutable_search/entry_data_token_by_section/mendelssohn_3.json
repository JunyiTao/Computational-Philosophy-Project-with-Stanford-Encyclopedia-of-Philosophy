    "main_text": "Natural Theology\n4. Natural Theology\n\nFrom the beginning of his career to the end, Mendelssohn consistently\nupheld the demonstrability of God\u2019s existence. However, not all\narguments were equally compelling in his view. In the Prize\nEssay he contends that probable arguments for God\u2019s\nexistence based upon beauty, order, and design are more eloquent and\nedifying but less certain and convincing than strict demonstrations.\nSimilarly, in Morning Hours, he cites the argument that the\nexternal senses\u2019 testimony to an external world is unthinkable\nwithout a necessary, extra-worldly being, but adds that this sort of\nargument would hardly convince an idealist, sceptic, or solipsist.\nThere are, however, at least two ways in which, according to\nMendelssohn, God\u2019s existence can be established with certainty.\nThe first way is through application of the principle of sufficient\nreason to the certain existence of contingent things. The inner\ntestimony of one\u2019s own cogito attests to the existence of\nsomething contingent. Since the sufficient reason for the existence of\ncontingent things must \u201cindirectly\u201d be a necessary being,\na necessary being exists. Hence, Mendelssohn sums up this argument by\nsaying: \u201cI am, therefore there is a God.\u201d\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 289; Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, pp. 78, 83f).\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s second way of proving God\u2019s existence is\nbased upon consideration of the idea of God together with the\nconditions of nonexistence. If something does not exist, then it is\neither impossible or merely possible. To say that something\nnonexistent is impossible is to say that its intrinsic properties are\ncontradictory, e.g., a square circle. To say that something\nnonexistent is possible is to say both that its intrinsic properties\nare insufficient to determine that it exists and that it is contingent\nupon extrinsic factors that do not obtain. If God does not exist, then\nit is either because the idea of God is impossible or because it is\nmerely possible, i.e., contingent. Since contingency entails\ndependency and independence is greater than dependence, it would\ncontradict the essence of a perfect being for that being to be\ncontingent. Hence, the idea of a perfect being cannot be the idea of\nsomething merely possible. But the idea of a perfect being also does\nnot contain determinations that must be affirmed and denied at the\nsame time; in other words, the idea is not impossible. In this way\nMendelssohn concludes that God exists from the consideration that the\nidea of God cannot be the idea of something nonexistent. While we can\nconceive finite, contingent, entities as nonexistent, we cannot\nconceive as nonexistent an infinite, necessary entity, namely, an\nentity that combines all affirmative features and properties to the\nhighest degree. \u201cIt can either not be thought at all or not be\nthought otherwise than with the predicate of actual existence\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 113/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n154). In this connection, it deserves mention that Mendelssohn rejects\nas quibbling the objection that existence is not a predicate. A\nconcept of existence, he maintains, emerges in all of us in a similar\nway as we search for what is common to what we do and undergo, thereby\nenjoying a universality that is not further analyzable. Thus,\nMendelssohn will allow that existence is not a predicate, that it is\ndifferent from all features and properties of things, and, hence,\ncannot be merely added to the list of properties of the most perfect\nentity. Nevertheless, whether existence is the \u201cposition\u201d\nof all properties of a thing or something inexplicable, Mendelssohn\nstands by his claim that we can only think something contingent\nwithout it. As he sums up the inference: \u201cA God is thinkable,\ntherefore a God is also actually on hand [vorhanden]\u201d\n(Morning Hours, p. 56 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 78).\n\nTowards the end of Morning Hours Mendelssohn introduces a\nfurther proof for God\u2019s existence, based upon our certainty of\n\u201cthe imperfection of our self-knowledge\u201d (Morning\nHours, p. 107/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 147). We have\ncertain knowledge, Mendelssohn contends, not only of ourselves but\nalso of the limited scope of this knowledge. \u201cI am not merely\nwhat I distinctly know of myself or, what amounts to the same, there\nis more to my existence than I might consciously observe of myself;\nand even what I know of myself is in and for itself capable of far\ngreater development, greater distinctness, and greater completeness\nthan I am able to give it\u201d (Morning Hours, p.\n103/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 141). From the limitations\nof our knowledge of ourselves (or, for that matter, of anything actual\nexisting) together with the less plausible assumption that \u201cthat\neverything actual must be thought to be actual by some thinking\nbeing,\u201d Mendelssohn infers that there is \u201can infinite\nintellect\u201d that does represent everything to itself (Morning\nHours, pp. 103f/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, pp. 141ff; for\na detailed comparison of Kant\u2019s favorable, pre-critical and\nunfavorable, critical views of proofs of God\u2019s existence with\nMendelssohn\u2019s early and late championing of certain proofs, see\nGuyer 2020, 75\u2013141; see, too, Rovira 2017.)\n",
