    "main_text": "Mysticism and Morality\n11. Mysticism and Morality\n\nSome scholars maintain that there is an intrinsic connection between\nmysticism and moral behavior, or even that mystical experiences are\nthe source and only justification of a moral concern for others. This\nis because mystical experiences blur or erase the\ndistinction between the subject and others (Stace 1960) and so\nremove the barrier to moral motivation, or because one\u2019s sense of\na \u201cself\u201d disappears entirely. Several scholars have argued, to the\ncontrary, that at least some mystical doctrines are\nincompatible with morality (Danto 1987, Kripal 2002). Monistic\nmystical metaphysics eliminates all distinctions between one person\nand others \u2014 all is one \u2014 and so there is no recognition\nof real persons distinct from oneself toward whom one can exercise a\nmoral concern. Hence, monistic mysticism precludes morality. Morality\nmust be between \u201cindependently real persons\u201d (Wainwright\n1983, 211\u2013212). David Loy (2002) argues that even if monistic\nmorality is not incompatible with morality, it fails to reveal the\nbest way to help people with compassion. Others argue that morality\ncan get off the ground with the ability to conceptualize \u201cthe\nwelfare of others\u201d without the need to recognize others as\nontologically distinct beings (Zelinski 2007).\n\nOthers maintain that there is no intrinsic connection between mystical\nexperience and moral behavior: one can empty oneself of all\nself-centeredness and self-interest without necessarily adopting a\nconcern for others. Enlightened mystics may no longer be\nself-centered, but they can be either moral or indifferent to others\n(Jones 2016, chap. 9). We need look no further than to Christian\ncomplaints about mystical antinomian excesses of the \u201cFree\nSpirits,\u201d the Mahayana Buddhist rejection of the alleged\nselfishness of the Arhat ideal in Theravada Buddhism, or the moral\nscandals of some Eastern mysticism in the West today (Kripal 2002). If\nmoral behavior is part of a mystical way of life, it does not issue\nfrom mystical experiences but from a mystic\u2019s cultural\nbackground and training. The normative behavioral standards of the\ngroup are not derivable from mystical experiences. Mystical\nexperiences, so the claim goes, in themselves are nonmoral. Thus,\nmuch will depend on the moral or nonmoral orientation of the mystical\npractices meant to lead to mystical experiences. The resulting\nbehavior will be a consequence of both the practices undertaken to\nreach mystical experience and the resulting detachment of the selfless\nmystical state (Jones 2004).\n",
