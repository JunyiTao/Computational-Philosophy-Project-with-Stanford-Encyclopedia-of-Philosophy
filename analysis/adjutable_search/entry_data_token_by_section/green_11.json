    "main_text": "Idealist Politics\n4. Idealist Politics\n\nGreen\u2019s political philosophy is expressed in his posthumously\npublished Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation\nand his 1881 essay \u201cLiberal Legislation and Freedom of\nContract\u201d. His perfectionist ethics influence his politics. He\nprovides the philosophical foundations for a new progressive form of\nliberalism that transcends the laissez-faire liberalism characteristic\nof some strands in nineteenth century British liberalism (Nicholson\n1990). The state has a duty to promote the common good, and individual\nrights are constrained by the common good. This gives the state not\njust negative duties to refrain from interfering with the freedoms of\nits citizens but also positive duties to provide resources and\nopportunities for individual self-realization.\n",
