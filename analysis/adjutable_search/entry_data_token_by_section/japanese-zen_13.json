    "main_text": "An Experiential Meaning of Not-Two || Zen\u2019s Nothing\n6.2 Zen\u2019s Nothing\n\nZen condenses \u201cno-thought and no-image\u201d into a singular\nword \u201cno\u201d in keeping with its proclivity to favor the\nsimple, as this contraction allows Zen to expand the scope and the\nmeaning of \u201cno-thought and no-image.\u201d This\n\u201cno,\u201d for example, is made pivotal by Zen Master\nJosh\u016b (Chin., Zhaozh\u014du; 778\u2013897). It is usually\nrendered in English as \u201cnothing\u201d and has been presented to\nthe Western reader as if it is the central and cardinal\nconcept of Zen philosophy. At the risk of de-emphasizing other\nimportant aspects of Zen such as how it understands the living\nphenomena of nature, humanity\u2018s relation to them, and aesthetic\nsensitivity, we will here focus on the scope and meaning of this Zen\n\u201cno\u201d \u7121.\n\nThis \u201cno\u201d appears in a Zen dialogue between Josh\u016b and\na monk, in which is thematized an issue of whether or not a dog has\nBuddha-nature. It reads as follows: A monk asks Josh\u016b:\n\u201cDoes the dog have buddha-nature?\u201d He replies:\n\u201cNo[thing].\u201d The monk says: \u201cAll sentient beings\nhave buddha-nature. Why doesn\u2019t the dog have it?\u201d\nJosh\u016b replies: \u201cHe has discrimination due to his\nkarma.\u201d Josh\u016b\u2019s response of \u201cno\u201d\nto the monk\u2019s question points to the latter\u2019s inadequate,\nand hence also mistaken, understanding of being. However, as\narticulated in the Nirv\u0101nas\u016btra, Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, of which Zen is an offshoot, asserts that all sentient\nbeings have buddha-nature. With this understanding in mind, the monk\nasked the question, to which Josh\u016b replied\n\u7121 (\u201cno\u201d). His \u201cno\u201d points to the\nfact that the way the monk formulates his question regarding being is\npredicated on an either-or logical understanding or an\naffirmation-negation linguistic device. In so doing, the monk\nrelativizes Buddha-nature qua being, while contrasting and\nopposing it with non-being. Buddha-nature is not something that the\ndog can have or not have; Buddha-nature is not\nsomething contingent. Josh\u016b\u2019s \u201cno\u201d allows the\nmonk to return to the ground from which the idea of the\nBuddha-nature springs forth as an essential characterization of all\nbeings. As such, Josh\u016b\u2019s \u201cno\u201d points to a\ntranscendence of being and non-being. Insofar as Zen\u2019s\n\u201cno\u201d is turned into an issue questioning the\nground of being, it is appropriate to understand it as\n\u201cnothing,\u201d and in fact as \u201cabsolutely\nnothing,\u201d because the latter goes beyond the relative nothing\nthat is contrasted with being.\n\nAs Josh\u016b\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d has been made a\nk\u014dan, numerous Zen masters have used it to test a\nstudent\u2019s progress in meditation. In such a case, a Zen master\nexpects a monk to come up with his or her original response by\nstipulating a condition: \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to answer\nthat the dog has buddha-nature nor that the dog does not have\nbuddha-nature.  Nor do I expect you to reply that the dog both has and\ndoes not have buddha-nature. Nor do I expect you to reply that the dog\nneither has nor does not have buddha-nature. How do you respond to\nthis?\u201d This is a warning that a monk cannot rely on\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s tetralemma as an acceptable response,\nnamely the four possible ways of understanding thing-events insofar as\nlogic is concerned: \u201cthere is,\u201d \u201cthere is\nnot,\u201d \u201cboth \u2018there is\u2019 and \u2018there is\nnot,\u2019\u201d and \u201cneither \u2018there is\u2019 nor\n\u2018there is not.\u2019\u201d This master is admonishing that as\nlong as a monk\u2019s response is framed from within the logic of the\neveryday use of language, no answer is forthcoming. Here the reader\ncan sense that the scope and the meaning of \u201cno-thought and\nno-image\u201d has been expanded to include the logical use of\nlanguage, not simply a rejection of oppositional thinking. \n\nA further expansion of the scope and the meaning of \u201cno\u201d\ncan be found in an instruction Zen Master Daie (Chin.,\nD\u00e0hu\u00ec;1089\u20131163) gives to his students, though it\nis given via negativa\u2014when they attempt to discover a\nresponse to Josh\u016b\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d (Yanagita, 1974,\n181\u20132). Prefacing his remark that \u201cthis one word [i.e.,\n\u2018no(-thing)\u2019] is a cane that shatters numerous [instances\nof] erroneous knowledge and perception,\u201d Daie instructs the\nstudents not to take \u201cno[thing]\u201d in the context of being\nor nonbeing by applying either-or logic. An appeal to discriminatory\nthinking based on the standpoint of [ego-]consciousness is of no use\neither. It is also unacceptable to appeal to bodily action, let alone\nto engage in a mere verbal exchange. Not even a metaphysical response\nwill do either, for Daie states: \u201cDo not throw it out into an\nempty-void where there is nothing. Do not swallow it where something\nis generated.\u201d To seek an answer in a text is also out of the\nquestion. Daie demands that the practitioner come up with his/her own\noriginal answer.\n\nWhat is evident in the above instructions is that the Zen practitioner\nmust tackle this \u201cno[thing]\u201d by mobilizing the\nwhole of his or her person in order to delve into the\nground of his or her personhood, where the\n\u201cwhole\u201d in question involves both the\nmind and the body, both the consciousness and the unconscious. This\nis, no doubt, an existential challenge to Zen practitioners, and so\nthey make an all-out effort, staking life and death, because it\nguarantees them an embodiment of truth and freedom. In this context,\nZen metaphorically speaks of reaching the whole as \u201ckicking\nthrough the bottom of a bucket\u201d to designate the ground of a\nperson, which Zen understands to be bottomless. That is, it\nunderstands this ground to have \u201cno\u201d bottom,\ni.e., it is a bottomless ground. To avoid the danger of interpreting\nthis ground nihilistically or relativisitically, the modern Japanese\nthinker, Nishida Kitar\u014d (1870\u20131945) adds that it is\nabsolutely nothing, where \u201cabsolutely\u201d means\ncutting off all pairs of polar opposites. (See the entry on\n Nishida Kitar\u014d.)\n",
