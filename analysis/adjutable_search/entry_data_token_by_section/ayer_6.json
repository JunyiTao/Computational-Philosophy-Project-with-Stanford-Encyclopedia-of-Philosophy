    "main_text": "Causality and Freedom\n7. Ethics\n\n\nThe emotivism espoused by Ayer in LTL was supported by his\nbelief in the distinction between fact and value. Given, he thought,\nthat there were no moral facts to be known, there could be no\nverification of such facts, and so moral utterances could have no\ncognitive significance. And given the connection between moral\n\u2018judgment\u2019 and motivation, and the connection between\nmotivation and feeling, it was natural to see moral utterances as\nhaving the function of expressing our feelings, or\n\u2018emoting\u2019. This view, Ayer was careful to point out, was\nnot that associated with subjectivism, that in making moral claims we\nare describing our feelings. This latter view would make\nmoral claims truth-evaluable, and Ayer\u2019s moral emotivism denied that\nthey were so evaluable. So when we say: \u201cCruelty towards\nchildren is wrong\u201d we are really expressing a negative attitude\ntowards killing children, and when we say \u201cBeing kind to old\npeople is good\u201d we are expressing positive feelings towards such\nacts of kindness. The expression of such positive or negative\nfeelings, he later thought, also contained a prescriptive element, so\nin such expressions we are also encouraging others to share those\nfeelings, and to act accordingly. As this makes clear, the attitudes\nexpressed were towards classes of acts, and not particular acts.\n\n\nEmotivism was thought by some to be the reductio ad absurdum\nof the verificationist theory of meaning, and indeed it was not the\npreferred metaethical position of other positivists, some of whom\npreferred a consequentialist approach, and so emotivism could be seen\nas separable from verificationism. In fact, in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the second edition of LTL Ayer\nstated that his commitment to emotivism would survive any demise of\nhis positivism, and it later became clear that it was because Ayer\nthought moral judgments to be not fact-stating that he concluded they\nwere unverifiable (see \u201cThe Analysis of Moral Judgments\u201d\nin Ayer 1954). Emotivism was given additional support by\nC.L.Stevenson, who had developed his ideas independently of Ayer, in\nhis book Ethics and Language (1944). In subsequent decades,\nit spawned a family of what came to be called\n\u201cexpressivist\u201d views in metaethics, which sought to state\nthe view with a sensitivity to the logical problems Ayer\u2019s\nformulation raised. \n\n\nIt has been suggested (Dreier 2004) that Ayer faced a particular\ndifficulty in defending this brand of non-cognitivism; the combination\nof affirming a redundancy theory of truth with the denial that moral\nclaims can be true looks suspicious. Although the two views are not\nincompatible (Ayer denied that moral claims were assertions, and the\nredundancy of the truth-predicate held only for assertions), the\ntension between the two is symptomatic of the worry that moral claims\nhave so many of the features of truth-evaluable assertions that one\nhas to be unjustifiably revisionist in construing them as\nnon-meaningful. They are, after all, typically expressed in indicative\nsentences, and people appear to dispute moral claims. This latter\npoint Ayer did respond to: moral disagreements were, he (and\nStevenson) claimed, either genuine disputes about non-moral facts, or\nsimply not genuine disagreements.  (For an examination of the trouble\nthat moral disagreement makes for emotivism, see Smith 1986.) There\nwas, however, a further, more troubling, point about the role of moral\nterms in arguments: moral terms can be used in arguments in which the\nmoral term appears in a conditional, and so is not there contributing\nto the expressive force of the utterance, so not expressing any\nemotion of the speaker. This latter point has been developed into a\nline of reasoning (called the \u201cFrege-Geach\u201d problem)\nagainst expressivism in general.  The problem for the expressivist is\nto make sense of simple arguments such as the following: (1) If John killed\nJane, he did something wrong. (2) John killed Jane. So (3) John did\nsomething wrong. The argument appears to be valid, and so not to\ninvolve any ambiguity, but the moral term can be construed as having\nexpressive force only in (3), not in (1).  Expressivism, and so\nemotivism, seems to introduce an unwarranted equivocation into the\nargument.\n\n\nIt is perhaps these \u2018surface\u2019 features of moral discourse,\nthose that make it look like moral claims are assertions, and hence\nexpressions of belief, and so truth-evaluable, and that moral\ndisagreement appears to be genuine moral disagreement, that\nlater tempted Ayer to consider Mackie\u2019s \u2018error\u2019 theory of\nmoral language (Mackie 1977) as closer to the truth (in Ayer\n1984). The details of emotivism tended to disappear from the\nmetaethical scene in the latter half of the twentieth century, but\nits guiding thoughts have remained very much alive in the expressivism\nof Blackburn 1984, 1998, and Gibbard 1990. (See Altham, 1979, for a\nsympathetic defense of these guiding thoughts, and Schroeder, 2010,\nfor a thorough treatment of the development of expressivism, with\nparticular attention paid to subsequent attempts to tackle the Frege-Geach\nproblem.)\n",
