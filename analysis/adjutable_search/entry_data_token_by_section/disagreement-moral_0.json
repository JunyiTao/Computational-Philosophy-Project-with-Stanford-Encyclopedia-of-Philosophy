    "main_text": "The Nature of Moral Disagreement\n1. The Nature of Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThere is little controversy about the existence of widespread\ndisagreement over moral issues, both within and between societies and\ncultures. Often used examples are the debates about the morality of the\ndeath penalty, of euthanasia, of abortion, and of meat-eating. Examples\nof cultural differences include infanticide and geronticide and other\nmore or less alien practices that historians and anthropologists have\nrevealed. For example, Napoleon Chagnon\u2019s account of the ways of\nthe Yanomam\u00f6 people in the Amazon basin is a popular source of\nillustrations (Chagnon 1997, but see also Tierney 2003 for a critical\ndiscussion). Some theorists assign special weight to disagreements\namong philosophers and professional ethicists who have engaged in\nsystematic reflection about moral issues (e.g., Wong 1984, ch. 10 and\nLeiter 2014). What they have in mind are, among other disputes, those\nbetween utilitarians and Kantians about what makes an action morally\nright and those between egalitarians and libertarians about what\njustice requires. How deep the disagreement goes, however, and how it\nis best explained, are disputed questions. So is another topic which in\na way precedes the others, namely, what it is, more\nspecifically, to disagree morally.\n",
