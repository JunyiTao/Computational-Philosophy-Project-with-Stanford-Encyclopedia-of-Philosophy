    "main_text": "Demythologized Religion\n3. Demythologized Religion\n\n\nIt is clear that the religion Maimonides envisions is not the normal\nkind. He recognizes that when one is first exposed to Bible stories and\nthe ritual of daily prayer, one may need anthropomorphic descriptions\nof God and promises of material reward. As he points out time and\nagain, the Torah speaks in the language of ordinary people. If it did\nnot, its appeal would be greatly reduced. But, Maimonides continues,\nthe purpose of the religion is to get one to the point where these\nthings cease to matter and are eventually overcome.\n\n\nTo take a few examples, the Bible often suggests that a prophet, or in\none case the elders of Israel, saw God (e.g., Exodus 24:10, Numbers\n12:8, Isaiah 6:1\u20133, Ezekiel 1:26\u201329). Maimonides counters\n(GP 1.4) by saying that the kind of seeing involved is\nintellectual rather than visual \u2014 as when one sees her way to\nthe solution of a geometry problem. By the same token, when God is\ndescribed as near or close, the Bible is not talking about physical\nlocation but intellectual apprehension \u2014 as when scientists say\nthey are close to finding a cure for a disease (GP 1.18). The\nmany places where the Bible says that God spoke to a prophet do not\nindicate that God has vocal cords that produce sound but that the\nprophet came to understand what God wants (GP 1.65). In a\nmore complicated way, Jacob\u2019s dream refers to the hierarchical\nstructure of the physical world and represents the path the\nphilosopher follows from knowledge of the sublunar realm to knowledge\nof the spheres and awareness of the existence of God (GP\n1.15).\n\n\nAgain one is inclined to ask: Is this the religion of the prophets\nor a philosophically sanitized religion concocted by a medieval thinker\nunder the sway of Aristotle? Maimonides would reply that there is no\ndifference. The highest human achievement is the perfection of the\nintellect (GP 3.27), which is impossible without the\npursuit of truth. As a sacred document, the Bible is a source of truth.\nWhile the truths contained in the Bible may not always be apparent, we\nknow in principle that they are there if one wishes to dig deeply\nenough. It follows that if one\u2019s interpretation ascribes to the Bible a\ndoctrine that is demonstrably false, such as the claim that God is\ncorporeal, the interpretation is incorrect no matter how simple or\nstraightforward it may seem. Should human knowledge advance and come up\nwith demonstrations it previously lacked, we would have no choice but\nto return to the Bible and alter our interpretation to take account of\nthem (GP 2.24). Anything else would be intellectually\ndishonest.\n\n\nWhere does this take us? In the Parable of the Palace (GP\n3.51), Maimonides describes the person who enters the inner habitation\nof the King as:\n He \u2026 who has achieved demonstration, to the\nextent that it is possible, of everything that may be demonstrated; and\nwho has ascertained in divine matters, to the extent that that is\npossible, everything that may be ascertained; and who has come close to\ncertainty in those matters in which one can only come close to it\n\u2026 \n\n\nThis is not just an intellectual achievement but a spiritual one as\nwell. In Maimonides\u2019 opinion, it is the goal to which all of the\ncommandments of the Torah point. There is an obvious sense of\nsatisfaction that goes with this, but it has nothing to do with\nsatisfaction material needs or \u201cecstasy\u201d as normally\nunderstood.\n",
