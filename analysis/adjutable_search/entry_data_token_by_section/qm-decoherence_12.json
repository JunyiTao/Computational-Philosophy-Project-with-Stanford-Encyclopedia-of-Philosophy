    "main_text": "The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics || Other approaches\n3.5 Other approaches\n3.5.1 Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics\n\nNelson\u2019s (1966, 1985) stochastic mechanics is a proposal to\nrecover the wave function and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as\neffective elements in the description of a fundamental diffusion\nprocess in configuration space. Insofar as the proposal is\n successful,[37]\n it shares many features with de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Indeed,\nthe current velocity for the particles in Nelson\u2019s theory turns\nout to be equal to the de Broglie\u2013Bohm velocity, and the\nparticle distribution in Nelson\u2019s theory is equal to that in de\nBroglie\u2013Bohm theory (in equilibrium).\n\nIt follows that many results from pilot-wave theories can be imported\ninto Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics, including those based on\ndecoherence. In particular, the strategies used in pilot-wave\ntheories to recover the appearance of collapse and the emergence of a\nclassical regime can be applied also to the case of stochastic\nmechanics, even though so far very little has been done along these\nlines. Doing so will arguably also resolve some conceptual puzzles\nspecific to Nelson\u2019s theory, such as the problem of two-time\ncorrelations raised in Nelson\n (2006).[38]\n\n3.5.2 Modal interpretations\n\nThe first \u2018modal interpretation\u2019 of quantum mechanics was\nproposed by Van Fraassen (1973, 1991), and was strictly an\ninterpretation of the theory (while other later versions came more to\nresemble pilot-wave theories; see the entry on\n modal interpretations).\n Van Fraassen\u2019s basic intuition was that the quantum state of a\nsystem should be understood as describing a collection of\npossibilities, represented by components in the (mixed) quantum state.\nHis proposal considers only decompositions at single instants, and is\nagnostic about re-identification over time. Thus, it can directly\nexploit only the fact that decoherence produces descriptions in terms\nof classical-like states, which will count as possibilities in Van\nFraassen\u2019s sense. This ensures \u2018empirical adequacy\u2019\nof the quantum description (crucial in Van Fraassen\u2019s\n constructive empiricism).\n The dynamical aspects of decoherence can be exploited indirectly, in\nthat single-time components will exhibit records of the past,\nwhich ensure adequacy with respect to observations, but about whose\nveridicity Van Fraassen remains agnostic.\n\nA different strand of modal interpretations is loosely associated with\nthe (distinct) views of Kochen (1985), Healey (1989) and Dieks (see\ne.g. Dieks and Vermaas 1998). We focus on the last of these to fix\nideas. Van Fraassen\u2019s possible decompositions are restricted to\none singled out by a mathematical criterion (related to the\nbiorthogonal decomposition theorem mentioned above in\n Section 3.4.1),\n and a dynamical picture is explicitly sought (and was later\ndeveloped). In the case of an ideal (non-approximate) quantum\nmeasurement, this special decomposition coincides with that defined by\nthe eigenstates of the measured observable and the corresponding\npointer states, and the interpretation thus appears to solve the\nmeasurement problem (for this case at least). In\nDieks\u2019s original intentions, the approach was meant to provide\nan attractive interpretation of quantum mechanics also in the case of\ndecoherence interactions, since at least in simple models of\ndecoherence the same kind of decomposition singles out more or less\nalso those states between which interference is suppressed (with a\nproviso about very degenerate states).\n\nInterestingly, this approach fails when applied to other models of\ndecoherence, e.g., that in Joos and Zeh (1985, Section III.2). Indeed,\nit appears that in more general models of decoherence the components\nsingled out by this version of the modal interpretation are given by\ndelocalised states, and are unrelated to the localised\ncomponents naturally privileged by decoherence (Donald 1998;\nBacciagaluppi 2000). Thus the relation with decoherence has been the\ntouchstone for these versions of the modal interpretation. Note that\nVan Fraassen\u2019s original interpretation is untouched by this\nproblem, and so are possibly some more recent modal or modal-like\ninterpretations by Spekkens and Sipe (2001), Bene and Dieks (2002),\nand Berkovitz and Hemmo (2006).\n\nThe general idea of modal interpretations, more or less in the spirit\nof Van Fraassen, can be applied more widely. For one thing, it is\ncognate to some of the views expressed in the decoherent histories\nliterature. Decoherent histories could be seen as alternative possible\nhistories of the world, one of which is in fact actualised. A\ndiscussion in these terms has been outlined by Hemmo (1996). Such\nviews are also possibly quite close to Everett\u2019s own views, who\n(maybe surprisingly for the modern reader) was not a realist but an\nempiricist. A discussion of Everett with parallels to Van Fraassen is\ngiven by Barrett (2015). One final view that has some similarities\nwith Van Fraassen\u2019s and should be equally able to exploit the\nresults of decoherence is Rovelli\u2019s\n relational quantum mechanics\n (see also Van Fraassen 2010).\n3.5.3 QBism\n\nQBism (originally short for \u2018quantum Bayesianism\u2019) is a\nview of quantum mechanics developed by Chris Fuchs and co-workers,\nwhich has made current the idea that subjective probabilities \u00e0\nla de Finetti can be used also in quantum mechanics (see the entry on\n quantum Bayesian and pragmatist views of quantum theory).\n The position is more radical than this, however, in that it does not\nonly claim that the quantum probabilities as defined by the quantum\nstate should be interpreted subjectively, but that the quantum state\nitself is merely an expression of an agent\u2019s degrees of\n belief.[39]\n\nThe role of decoherence in QBism is rather downplayed. E.g. Fuchs and\nSchack (2012, Section 7) see it in light of the reflection principle\n(concerning an agent\u2019s beliefs about their future beliefs).\nSpecifically, in the context of a von Neumann measurement chain, an\nagent can use the state of the system as decohered by some later\nelements of the chain as an expression of their beliefs about what\ntheir beliefs will be after the previous elements of the measurement\nchain have been completed. (And of course, the results of decoherence\ncan be taken into account if an agent is considering making\nmeasurements on a system that is in interaction with some\nenvironment.) Because they are subjectivists not just about\nprobabilities but also about the quantum state, however, what QBists\ncannot exploit is the relevance of decoherence to the emergence of the\nentire classical world in which (human) agents have in fact evolved\n\u2013 unless, that is, agents are not treated as agents but\nas mere physical systems. The QBist\u2019s predicament thus is\nsimilar to Bohr\u2019s: decoherence clearly appears to be relevant to\nthe emergence of the very structures that are deemed to be\nconceptually prior to their analysis of quantum mechanics itself.\n\n4. Scope of Decoherence\n\nWe have seen in the last section that not all approaches to quantum\nmechanics can make full use of decoherence. In those approaches that\ncan, however, decoherence is instrumental in yielding a wealth of\nstructures that emerge from the unitary Schr\u00f6dinger (or\nHeisenberg) dynamics. How far can this programme of\ndecoherence (Zeh 2003a, p. 9) be successfully developed? \n4.1 The world according to decoherence\n\nWhat seems very clear is that decoherence is crucial for the emergence\nof much of the macroscopic world around us, from the motions in the\nsolar system (cf. the discussion of the motion of Saturn\u2019s moon\nHyperion \u2013 for an assessment of which see Schlosshauer (2008))\nand down to the working of enzymes (which relies on their molecular\nshapes). The detailed picture of the world that emerges from\ndecoherence, however, is full of subtleties.\n\nFor one thing, while the more \u2018macroscopic\u2019 a system, the\nmore pervasive the effects of decoherence and the more complex the\nstructures that emerge through it, this is only a rule of thumb. Not\nall molecules are chiral (bound ammonia groups tend to be\nin superpositions for instance), and there is no clear-cut criterion\nfor when a system should count as macroscopic. Indeed, even apart from\nexamples like superconducting systems, there might be surprising cases\nin which not all interference effects have been suppressed by\ndecoherence even at the macroscopic level. A famous proposal by\nHameroff and Penrose (1996) links the phenomenon of consciousness with\nthe possibility of quantum superpositions within microtubules (and\ntheir subsequent active suppression via collapse); other authors\ninterpret the mathematically quantum-like effects described within\n\u2018quantum cognition\u2019 as actual quantum effects (for both, see the\nentry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness).\n At present, most macroscopic quantum effects remain speculative at\nbest, but plausible cases for the continuing relevance of quantum\nsuperpositions at the macroscopic level can be found in quantum\nbiology, notably the studies of possible quantum effects in the\nnavigational system of migrating birds (Cai, Guerreschi and Briegel\n2010).\n\nCloser to home, while the classical world is recognised as having been\nall the time a dynamical pattern emerging from quantum mechanics, it\nturns out to be less classical than we might have expected. One\ninteresting example is the description of classically chaotic systems.\nA straightforward application of the techniques allowing one to derive\nNewtonian trajectories at the level of components has been employed by\nZurek and Paz (1994) to derive chaotic trajectories in\nquantum mechanics. The problem with the quantum description of chaotic\nbehaviour is that prima facie it should be impossible. Chaos\nis characterised roughly as extreme sensitivity in the behaviour of a\nsystem on its initial conditions, in the sense that the distance\nbetween the trajectories arising from different initial conditions\nincreases exponentially in time (see the entry on\n chaos).\n Since the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is unitary, it\npreserves all scalar products and all distances between quantum state\nvectors. Thus, it would seem, close initial conditions lead to\ntrajectories that are uniformly close throughout all of time, and no\nchaotic behaviour is possible (\u2018problem of quantum\nchaos\u2019). The crucial point that enables Zurek and Paz\u2019s\nanalysis is that the relevant trajectories defined by decoherence are\nat the level of components of the state of the system.\nUnitarity is preserved because the vectors in the environment, to\nwhich these different components are coupled, are and remain\northogonal: how the components themselves more specifically evolve is\nimmaterial. Explicit modelling yields a picture of quantum chaos in\nwhich different trajectories branch (a feature absent from classical\nchaos, which is deterministic) and then indeed diverge exponentially.\n(As with the crossing of trajectories in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory\nin\n Section 3.2,\n one has behaviour at the level of components that is qualitatively\ndifferent from the behaviour derived for wave functions of an isolated\nsystem.) The qualitative picture is the same as we mentioned above in\n Section 1.3,\n of classical trajectories that are kicked slightly off course\n(trajectories with slight kinks). In the case of classically chaotic\nsystems, however, this has a dramatic effect. This means that systems\nlike the weather turn out to be \u2018branching\u2019 all the time\ndue to decoherence interactions, so that what we usually think of as\nclassical unpredictability is in fact quantum indeterminism! (For an\nexcellent discussion, see Wallace 2012a, Chapters 3 and 10.) \n\nAnd as we have also mentioned, quantum phenomena themselves\nare a feature of the world that emerges through decoherence (Zeh\n2003a, p. 33; see also Bacciagaluppi 2002, Section 6.2): not only the\nstability of the outcomes of laboratory measurements, and thus\n\u2018quantum phenomena\u2019 in the specific sense of Bohr, but\nalso quantum jumps or the appearance of \\(\\alpha\\)-particle trajectories\nare a direct consequence of decoherence. The classical world yielded\nby decoherence is thus one (or one of many!) punctuated by quantum\nphenomena.\n4.2 Further applications\n\nFurther along these lines, Zeh (2003b) argues that decoherence can\nexplain the appearance of particle detections within quantum\nfield theory (see the entry on\n quantum field theory).\n Therefore, only fields need to be included in the fundamental\nconcepts, and \u2018particles\u2019 are a derived concept, unlike\nwhat might be suggested by the customary introduction of fields\nthrough a process of \u2018second quantisation\u2019. Another\napplication to quantum field theory is the suggestion that the\njustification for the (strict) superselection rule for charge in\nquantum field theory can also be phrased in terms of decoherence. As\npointed out by Giulini, Kiefer and Zeh (1995; see also Giulini et\nal. 1996, Section 6.4), an electric charge is surrounded by a\nCoulomb field (which electrostatically is infinitely extended; the\nargument can also be carried out using the retarded field, though).\nStates of different electric charge of a particle are thus coupled to\ndifferent, presumably orthogonal, states of its electric field. One\ncan consider the far-field as an effectively uncontrollable\nenvironment that decoheres the particle (and the near-field), so that\nsuperpositions of different charges are indeed always\n suppressed.[40]\n\nAnother claim about the significance of decoherence relates to time\nasymmetry (see e.g. the entries on\n time asymmetry in thermodynamics\n and\n philosophy of statistical mechanics).\n Insofar as apparent collapse (branching) is indeed a time-directed\nprocess, decoherence will have direct relevance to the emergence of\nthis \u2018quantum mechanical arrow of time\u2019. This is not a\nstraightforward issue, however, and questions familiar from the\nfoundations of statistical mechanics arise also in the context of\ndecoherence. Specific issues include the fact that models of\nenvironmental decoherence tend to assume very special (unentangled)\ninitial conditions, and the fact that the definition of the\ndecoherence functional in the histories approach is itself\nasymmetrical (although symmetric versions also exist). For a spectrum\nof discussions, see Hartle (1998, and references therein), Zeh (2001,\nChapter 4), and Bacciagaluppi (2002, Section 6.1; 2007). Whether\ndecoherence is connected to the other familiar arrows of time is a\nmore specific question. Indeed, should decoherence allow us to recover\nthe time-symmetric classical description of, say, particle\ntrajectories in a gas, or does it allow us to derive time-asymmetric\nthermodynamic behaviour directly, by-passing classical attempts at\nunderstanding it? Note that insofar as classical systems such as gases\nare believed to be chaotic, the origin of the probabilities in\nclassical statistical mechanics will arguably be quantum. For various\ndiscussions, see e.g. Zurek and Paz (1994), Hemmo and Shenker (2001),\nand Wallace (2012a, Chapter 9; and 2001, 2013a, 2013b in the\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n\nFinally, it has been suggested that decoherence should be a useful\ningredient in a theory of quantum gravity (see the entry on\n quantum gravity),\n as discussed e.g. by Kiefer (1994). First, because a suitable\ngeneralisation of decoherence theory to a full theory of quantum\ngravity should yield suppression of interference between different\nclassical spacetimes (see e.g. also Giulini et al. 1996,\nSection 4.2). Second, it is speculated that decoherence might solve\nthe so-called problem of time, which arises as a prominent\npuzzle in (the \u2018canonical\u2019 approach to) quantum gravity.\nThis is the problem that the candidate fundamental equation (in this\napproach) \u2013 the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation \u2013 is an\nanalogue of a time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and\ndoes not contain time at all, so that time needs somehow to emerge. In\nthe context of decoherence theory, one can for instance construct toy\nmodels in which the analogue of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt wave function\ndecomposes into non-interfering components (for a suitable sub-system)\neach satisfying a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nso that decoherence appears in fact as the source of time. An\naccessible introduction to and philosophical discussion of such models\nis given by Ridderbos (1999), with references to the original papers.\nSee also the more recent model by Halliwell and Thorwart\n (2002).[41]",
