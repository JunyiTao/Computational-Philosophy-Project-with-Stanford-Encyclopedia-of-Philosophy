    "main_text": "The Methodology of Metaphysics\n5. Is Metaphysics Possible?\n\nIt may also be that there is no internal unity to metaphysics. More\nstrongly, perhaps there is no such thing as metaphysics\u2014or at\nleast nothing that deserves to be called a science or a study or a\ndiscipline. Perhaps, as some philosophers have proposed, no\nmetaphysical statement or theory is either true or false. Or perhaps,\nas others have proposed, metaphysical theories have truth-values, but\nit is impossible to find out what they are. At least since the time of\nHume, there have been philosophers who have proposed that metaphysics\nis \u201cimpossible\u201d\u2014either because its questions are\nmeaningless or because they are impossible to answer. The remainder of\nthis entry will be a discussion of some recent arguments for the\nimpossibility of metaphysics.\n\nLet us suppose that we are confident that we are able to identify\nevery statement as either \u201ca metaphysical statement\u201d or\n\u201cnot a metaphysical statement\u201d. (We need not suppose that\nthis ability is grounded in some non-trivial definition or account of\nmetaphysics.) Let us call the thesis that all metaphysical statements\nare meaningless \u201cthe strong form\u201d of the thesis that\nmetaphysics is impossible. (At one time, an enemy of metaphysics might\nhave been content to say that all metaphysical statements were false.\nBut this is obviously not a possible thesis if the denial of a\nmetaphysical statement must itself be a metaphysical statement.) And\nlet us call the following statement the \u201cweak form\u201d of the\nthesis that metaphysics is impossible: metaphysical statements are\nmeaningful, but human beings can never discover whether any\nmetaphysical statement is true or false (or probable or improbable or\nwarranted or unwarranted).\n\nLet us briefly examine an example of the strong form of the thesis\nthat metaphysics is impossible. The logical positivists maintained\nthat the meaning of a (non-analytic) statement consisted entirely in\nthe predictions it made about possible experience. They maintained,\nfurther, that metaphysical statements (which were obviously not put\nforward as analytic truths) made no predictions about experience.\nTherefore, they concluded, metaphysical statements are\nmeaningless\u2014or, better, the \u201cstatements\u201d we classify\nas metaphysical are not really statements at all: they are things that\nlook like statements but aren\u2019t, rather as mannequins are things\nthat look like human beings but aren\u2019t.\n\nBut (many philosophers asked) how does the logical positivist\u2019s\ncentral thesis\n\nThe meaning of a statement consists entirely in the predictions it\nmakes about possible experience\n\n\nfare by its own standards? Does this thesis make any predictions about\npossible experiences? Could some observation show that it was true?\nCould some experiment show that it was false? It would seem not. It\nwould seem that everything in the world would look the same\u2014like\nthis\u2014whether this thesis was true or false. (Will the positivist\nreply that the offset sentence is analytic? This reply is problematic\nin that it implies that the multitude of native speakers of English\nwho reject the logical positivists\u2019 account of meaning somehow\ncannot see that that sentence is true in virtue of the meaning of the\nword \u201cmeaning\u201d\u2014which is no technical term but a word\nof ordinary English.) And, therefore, if the statement is true it is\nmeaningless; or, what is the same thing, if it is meaningful, it is\nfalse. Logical positivism would therefore seem to say of itself that\nit is false or meaningless; it would be seem to be, to use a currently\nfashionable phrase, \u201cself-referentially incoherent\u201d.\n\nCurrent advocates of \u2018metaphysical anti-realism\u2019 also\nadvocate a strong form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible.\nInsofar as it is possible to find a coherent line of argument in the\nwritings of any anti-realist, it is hard to see why they, like the\nlogical positivists, are not open to a charge of self-referential\nincoherency. Indeed, there is much to be said for the conclusion that\nall forms of the strong thesis fall prey to self-referential\nincoherency. Put very abstractly, the case against proponents of the\nstrong thesis may be put like this. Dr. McZed, a \u201cstrong\nanti-metaphysician\u201d, contends that any piece of text that does\nnot pass some test she specifies is meaningless (if she is typical of\nstrong anti-metaphysicians, she will say that any text that fails the\ntest represents an attempt to use language in a way in which language\ncannot be used). And she contends further that any piece of text that\ncan plausibly be identified as \u201cmetaphysical\u201d must fail\nthis test. But it invariably turns out that various sentences that are\nessential components of McZed\u2019s case against metaphysics\nthemselves fail to pass her test. A test-case for this very schematic\nand abstract refutation of all refutations of metaphysics is the very\nsophisticated and subtle critique of metaphysics (it purports to apply\nonly to the kind of metaphysics exemplified by the seventeenth-century\nrationalists and current analytical metaphysics) presented in van\nFraassen 2002. It is a defensible position that van Fraassen\u2019s\ncase against metaphysics depends essentially on certain theses that,\nalthough they are not themselves metaphysical theses, are nevertheless\nopen to many of the criticisms he brings against metaphysical\ntheses.\n\nThe weak form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible is this:\nthere is something about the human mind (perhaps even the minds of all\nrational agents or all finite rational agents) that unfits it for\nreaching metaphysical conclusions in any reliable way. This idea is at\nleast as old as Kant, but a version of it that is much more modest\nthan Kant\u2019s (and much easier to understand) has been carefully\npresented in McGinn 1993. McGinn\u2019s argument for the conclusion\nthat the human mind is (as a matter of evolutionary contingency, and\nnot simply because it is \u201ca mind\u201d) incapable of a\nsatisfactory treatment of a large range of philosophical questions (a\nrange that includes all metaphysical questions), however, depends on\nspeculative factual theses about human cognitive capacities that are\nin principle subject to empirical refutation and which are at present\nwithout significant empirical support. For a different defense of the\nweak thesis, see Thomasson 2009.\n",
