    "main_text": "\n\n\nAlbertus Magnus, also known as Albert the Great, was one of the most\nuniversal thinkers to appear during the Middle Ages. Even more so than\nhis most famous student, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Albert\u2019s\ninterests ranged from natural science all the way to theology. He made\ncontributions to logic, psychology, metaphysics, meteorology,\nmineralogy, and zoology. He was an avid commentator on nearly all the\ngreat authorities read during the 13th Century. He was\ndeeply involved in an attempt to understand the import of the thought\nof Aristotle in some orderly fashion that was distinct from the Arab\ncommentators who had incorporated their own ideas into the study of\nAristotle. Yet he was not averse to using some of the outstanding Arab\nphilosophers in developing his own ideas in philosophy. His superior\nunderstanding of a diversity of philosophical texts allowed him to\nconstruct one of the most remarkable syntheses in medieval\nculture.\n",
