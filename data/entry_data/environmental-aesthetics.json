    "preamble": "\n\nEnvironmental aesthetics is a relatively new sub-field of\nphilosophical aesthetics. It arose within analytic aesthetics in the\nlast third of the twentieth century. Prior to its emergence,\naesthetics within the analytic tradition was largely concerned with\nphilosophy of art. Environmental aesthetics originated as a reaction\nto this emphasis, pursuing instead the investigation of the aesthetic\nappreciation of natural environments. Since its early stages, the\nscope of environmental aesthetics has broadened to include not simply\nnatural environments but also human and human-influenced ones. At the\nsame time, the discipline has also come to include the examination of\nthat which falls within such environments, giving rise to what is\ncalled the aesthetics of everyday life. This area involves the\naesthetics of not only more common objects and environments, but also\na range of everyday activities. Thus, early in the twenty-first\ncentury, environmental aesthetics embraced the study of the aesthetic\nsignificance of almost everything other than art. Together with this\nbroader scope of environmental aesthetics, the twenty-first century\nhas also given rise to renewed and more intense investigations of the\nrelationship between environmental aesthetics and environmentalism as\nwell as to several new interests and directions. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n\nAlthough environmental aesthetics has developed as a sub-field of\nWestern philosophical aesthetics only in the last forty years, it has\nhistorical roots in eighteenth and nineteenth century European and\nNorth American aesthetics. In these centuries, there were important\nadvances in the aesthetics of nature, including the emergence of the\nconcept of disinterestedness together with those of the sublime and\nthe picturesque, as well as the introduction of the idea of positive\naesthetics. These notions continue to play a role in contemporary work\nin environmental aesthetics, especially in the context of its\nrelationship to environmentalism. (See also Section 5.1 below.)\n1.1 Eighteenth Century Aesthetics of Nature\n\nIn the West, the first major philosophical developments in the\naesthetics of nature occurred in the eighteenth century. During that\ncentury, the founders of modern aesthetics not only began to take\nnature as a paradigmatic object of aesthetic experience, they also\ndeveloped the concept of disinterestedness as the mark of such\nexperience. Over the course of the century, this concept was\nelaborated by various thinkers, who employed it to purge from\naesthetic appreciation an ever-increasing range of interests and\nassociations. According to one standard account (Stolnitz 1961), the\nconcept originated with the third Earl of Shaftesbury, who introduced\nit as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, was\nembellished by Francis Hutcheson, who expanded it so as to exclude\nfrom aesthetic experience not simply personal and utilitarian\ninterests, but also associations of a more general nature, and was\nfurther developed by Archibald Alison, who took it to refer to a\nparticular state of mind. The concept was given its classic\nformulation in Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment, in\nwhich nature was taken as an exemplary object of aesthetic experience.\nKant argued that natural beauty was superior to that of art and that\nit complemented the best habits of mind. It is no accident that the\ndevelopment of the concept of disinterestedness and the acceptance of\nnature as an ideal object of aesthetic appreciation went hand in hand.\nThe clarification of the notion of the aesthetic in terms of the\nconcept of disinterestedness disassociated the aesthetic appreciation\nof nature from the appreciator\u2019s particular personal, religious,\neconomic, or utilitarian interests, any of which could impede\naesthetic experience.\n\nThe theory of disinterestedness also provided groundwork for\nunderstanding the aesthetic dimensions of nature in terms of three\ndistinct conceptualizations. The first involved the idea of the\nbeautiful, which readily applies to tamed and cultivated\ngardens and landscapes. The second centered on the idea of the\nsublime. In the experience of the sublime, the more\nthreatening and terrifying of nature\u2019s manifestations, such as\nmountains and wilderness, when viewed with disinterestedness, can be\naesthetically appreciated, rather than simply feared or despised.\nThese two notions were importantly elaborated by Edmund Burke and\nKant. However, concerning the appreciation of nature, a third concept\nwas to become more significant than that of either the beautiful or\nthe sublime: the notion of the picturesque. Thus, by the end\nof the eighteenth century, there were three clearly distinct ideas\neach focusing on different aspects of nature\u2019s diverse and often\ncontrasting moods. One historian of the picturesque tradition (Conron\n2000) argues that in \u201ceighteenth-century English theory, the\nboundaries between aesthetic categories are relatively clear and\nstable\u201d. The differences can be summarized as follows: objects\nexperienced as beautiful tend to be small and smooth, but subtly\nvaried, delicate, and \u201cfair\u201d in color, while those\nexperienced as sublime, by contrast, are powerful, vast, intense,\nterrifying, and \u201cdefinitionless\u201d. Picturesque items are\ntypically in the middle ground between those experienced as either\nsublime or beautiful, being complex and eccentric, varied and\nirregular, rich and forceful, and vibrant with energy.\n\nIt is not surprising that of these three notions, the idea of the\npicturesque, rather that of the beautiful or the sublime, achieved the\ngreatest prominence concerning the aesthetic experience of nature. Not\nonly does it occupy the extensive middle ground of the complex,\nirregular, forceful, and vibrant, all of which abound in the natural\nworld, it also reinforced various long-standing connections between\nthe aesthetic appreciation of nature and the treatment of nature in\nart. The term \u201cpicturesque\u201d literally means\n\u201cpicture-like\u201d and the theory of the picturesque advocates\naesthetic appreciation in which the natural world is experienced as if\ndivided into art-like scenes, which ideally resemble works of arts,\nespecially landscape painting, in both subject matter and composition.\nThus, since the concept of disinterestedness mandated appreciation of\nnature stripped of the appreciator\u2019s own personal interests and\nassociations, it helped to clear the ground for experience of nature\ngoverned by the theory of the picturesque, by which the appreciator is\nencouraged to see nature in terms of a new set of artistic images and\nassociations. In this way the idea of the picturesque relates to\nearlier conceptions of the natural world as comprised of what were\ncalled \u201cworks of nature\u201d, which, although considered in\nthemselves to be proper and important objects of aesthetic experience,\nwere thought to be even more appealing when they resembled works of\nart. The idea also resonates with other artistic traditions, such as\nthat of viewing art as the mirror of nature. The theory of the\npicturesque received its fullest treatment in the late eighteenth\ncentury when it was popularized in the writings of William Gilpin,\nUvedale Price, and Richard Payne Knight. At that time, it provided an\naesthetic ideal for English tourists, who pursued picturesque scenery\nin the Lake District, the Scottish Highlands, and the Alps.\n1.2 Nineteenth Century Aesthetics of Nature\n\nFollowing its articulation in the eighteenth century, the idea of the\npicturesque remained a dominant influence on popular aesthetic\nexperience of nature throughout the entire nineteenth and well into\nthe twentieth century. Indeed, it is still an important component of\nthe kind of aesthetic experience commonly associated with ordinary\ntourism\u2014that which involves seeing and appreciating the natural\nworld as it is represented in the depictions found in travel\nbrochures, calendar photos, and picture postcards. However, while the\nidea of the picturesque continued to guide popular aesthetic\nappreciation of nature, the philosophical study of the aesthetics of\nnature, after flowering in the eighteenth century, went into decline.\nMany of the main themes, such as the concept of the sublime, the\nnotion of disinterestedness, and the theoretical centrality of nature\nin philosophical aesthetics, culminated with Kant, who gave some of\nthese ideas such exhaustive treatment that a kind of philosophical\nclosure was seemingly achieved. Following Kant, a new world order was\ninitiated by Hegel. In Hegel\u2019s philosophy, art was the highest\nexpression of \u201cAbsolute Spirit\u201d, and it, rather than\nnature, was destined to become the favored subject of philosophical\naesthetics. Thus, in the nineteenth century, both on the continent and\nin the United Kingdom, relatively few philosophers and only a\nscattering of thinkers of the Romantic Movement seriously pursued the\ntheoretical study of the aesthetics of nature. There was no\nphilosophical work comparable to that of the preceding century.\n\nHowever, while the philosophical study of the aesthetics of nature\nlanguished in Europe, a new way of understanding the aesthetic\nappreciation of the natural world was developing in North America.\nThis conception of nature appreciation had roots in the American\ntradition of nature writing, as exemplified in the essays of Henry\nDavid Thoreau. It was also inspired by the idea of the picturesque\nand, to a lesser extent, that of the sublime, especially in its\nartistic manifestations, such as the paintings of Thomas Cole and\nFrederic Church. However, as nature writing became its more dominant\nform of expression, the conception was increasingly shaped by\ndevelopments in the natural sciences. In the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury, it was influenced by the geographical work of George Perkins\nMarsh (Marsh 1865), who argued that humanity was increasingly causing\nthe destruction of the beauty of nature. The idea was forcefully\npresented toward the end of the century in the work of American\nnaturalist John Muir, who was steeped in natural history. Muir\nexplicitly distinguished this kind of understanding of the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature from that governed by the idea of the\npicturesque. In a well-known essay, \u201cA Near View of the High\nSierra\u201d (Muir 1894), two of Muir\u2019s artist companions, who\nfocus on mountain scenery, exemplify aesthetic experience of nature as\nguided by the idea of the picturesque. This differs from Muir\u2019s\nown aesthetic experience, which involved an interest in and\nappreciation of the mountain environment somewhat more akin to that of\na geologist. This way of experiencing nature eventually brought Muir\nto see the whole of the natural environment and especially wild nature\nas aesthetically beautiful and to find ugliness primarily where nature\nwas subject to human intrusion. The range of things that he regarded\nas aesthetically appreciable seemed to encompass the entire natural\nworld, from creatures considered hideous in his day, such as snakes\nand alligators, to natural disasters thought to ruin the environment,\nsuch as floods and earthquakes. The kind of nature appreciation\npracticed by Muir has become associated with the contemporary point of\nview called \u201cpositive aesthetics\u201d (Carlson 1984). Insofar\nas such appreciation eschews humanity\u2019s marks on the natural\nenvironment, it is somewhat the converse of aesthetic appreciation\ninfluenced by the idea of the picturesque, which finds interest and\ndelight in evidence of human presence.\n2. Twentieth Century Developments\n\nWestern philosophical study of the aesthetics of the natural world\nreached a low point in the middle of the twentieth century, with the\nfocus of analytic aesthetics almost exclusively on philosophy of art.\nAt the same time, both the view that aesthetic appreciation of nature\nis parasitic upon that of art and even the idea that it is not in fact\naesthetic appreciation at all were defended by some thinkers. However,\nin the last third of the century, there was a reaction to the neglect\nof the natural world by the discipline of aesthetics, which initiated\na revival of the aesthetic investigation of nature and led to the\nemergence of environmental aesthetics.\n2.1 The Neglect of the Aesthetics of Nature\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, Anglo-American philosophy\nlargely ignored the aesthetics of nature. However, there were some\nnoteworthy exceptions. For example, in North America, George Santayana\ninvestigated the topic as well as the concept of nature itself.\nSomewhat later, John Dewey contributed to the understanding of the\naesthetic experience of both nature and everyday life, and Curt\nDucasse discussed the beauty of nature as well as that of the human\nform. In England, R. G. Collingwood worked on both the philosophy of\nart and the idea of nature, but the two topics did not importantly\ncome together in his thought. However, other than a few such\nindividuals, as far as aesthetics was pursued, there was little\nserious consideration of the aesthetics of nature. On the contrary,\nthe discipline was dominated by an interest in art. By the\nmid-twentieth century, within analytic philosophy, the principal\nphilosophical school in the English-speaking world at that time,\nphilosophical aesthetics was virtually equated with philosophy of art.\nThe leading aesthetics textbook of the period was subtitled\nProblems in the Philosophy of Criticism and opened with the\nassertion: \u201cThere would be no problems of aesthetics, in the\nsense in which I propose to mark out this field of study, if no one\never talked about works of art\u201d (Beardsley 1958). The comment\nwas meant to emphasize the importance of the analysis of language, but\nit also reveals the art-dominated construal of aesthetics of that\ntime. Moreover, if and when the aesthetic appreciation of nature was\ndiscussed, it was treated, by comparison with that of art, as a messy,\nsubjective business of less philosophical interest. Some of the major\naestheticians of the second half of the century argued that aesthetic\njudgments beyond what became known as the \u201cartworld\u201d must\nremain relative to conditions of observation and unfettered by the\nkind of constraints that govern the appreciation of art (Walton 1970,\nDickie 1974).\n\nThe domination of analytic aesthetics by an interest in art had two\nramifications. On the one hand, it helped to motivate a controversial\nphilosophical position that denied the possibility of any aesthetic\nexperience of nature whatsoever. The position held that aesthetic\nappreciation necessarily involves aesthetic judgments, which entail\njudging the object of appreciation as the achievement of a designing\nintellect. However, since nature is not the product of a designing\nintellect, its appreciation is not aesthetic (Mannison 1980). In the\npast, nature appreciation was deemed aesthetic because of the\nassumption that nature is the work of a designing creator, but this\nassumption is simply false or at least inadequate for grounding any\naesthetics of nature. On the other hand, the art-dominated construal\nof aesthetics also gave support to approaches that stand within the\nmany different historical traditions that conceptualize the natural\nworld as essentially art-like\u2014for example, as a set of the\n\u201cworks of nature\u201d, or as the \u201chandiwork\u201d of a\ncreator, or as picturesque scenery. For example, what might be called\na landscape model of nature appreciation, which stems directly from\nthe tradition of the picturesque, proposes that we should\naesthetically experience nature as we appreciate landscape paintings.\nThis requires seeing it to some extent as if it were a series of\ntwo-dimensional scenes and focusing either on artistic qualities\ndependent upon romantic images of the kind associated with the idea of\nthe picturesque or simply on its formal aesthetic qualities. Such\nart-oriented models of the aesthetic appreciation of nature, in\naddition to being supported by powerful and long-standing traditions\nof thought (Biese 1905, Nicolson 1959), are reconsidered in some\nrecent work in environmental aesthetics (Stecker 1997, Crawford 2004,\nLeddy 2005a, Tafalla 2010, Paden 2015b). Likewise, the defense of\nformalist aesthetic appreciation of nature has recently been renewed\n(Zangwill 2001 2013, Welchman 2018), along with related discussion and\ndebate (Parsons 2004, Parsons and Carlson 2004, Moore 2006).\n2.2 The Emergence of Environmental Aesthetics\n\nIn the last third of the twentieth century, a renewed interest in the\naesthetics of nature emerged. This revival was the result of several\ndifferent factors. In part, it was a response to the growing public\nconcern about the apparent degeneration of the environment, aesthetic\nand otherwise. It was also the result of the academic world becoming\naware of the significance of the environmental movement\u2014at the\nlevel of both theoretical discussion and practical action. It is\nnoteworthy that the emergence of the philosophical study of\nenvironmental ethics also dates from this time. Some of the earlier\nwork in environmental aesthetics focused on empirical research\nconducted in response to public apprehension about the aesthetic state\nof the environment. Critics of this research argued that the landscape\nassessment and planning techniques used in environmental management\nwere inadequate in stressing mainly formal properties, while\noverlooking expressive and other kinds of aesthetic qualities (Sagoff\n1974, Carlson 1976). Empirical approaches were also faulted as fixated\non \u201cscenic beauty\u201d and overly influenced by ideas such as\nthat of the picturesque (Carlson 1977). In general, the area was\nthought to be beset by theoretical problems (Sparshott 1972), and the\nempirical research in particular was said to lack an adequate\nconceptual framework, often being conducted in what one critic called\na \u201ctheoretical vacuum\u201d (Appleton 1975b). Attempts to fill\nthis vacuum prompted the idea of sociobiological underpinnings for the\naesthetic appreciation of nature, such as \u201cprospect-refuge\ntheory\u201d (Appleton 1975a 1982), as well as other kinds of\nevolution-related accounts (Orians and Heerwagen 1986 1992), the idea\nof which has recently received more attention from some philosophers\n(Davies 2012, Paden et al 2012, Paden 2015a 2016, Bartalesi\nand Portera 2015). In addition, the concerns of this period motivated\nthe development of a variety of theoretical models of aesthetic\nresponse grounded in, for example, developmental and environmental\npsychology (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989, Bourassa 1991). There are\noverviews (Zube 1984, Cats-Baril and Gibson 1986, Daniel 2001) and\ncollections (Saarinen et al 1984, Nasar 1988, Sheppard and\nHarshaw 2001) of this and related kinds of research, as well as more\nrecent studies that, although they are essentially empirical in\norientation, are of considerable theoretical interest (Porteous 1996,\nBell 1999, Parsons and Daniel 2002, Gobster et al 2007, Hill\nand Daniel 2008, Gobster 2008 2013). One comprehensive review of this\nkind of research also includes some discussion of its relationship to\nphilosophical work in environmental aesthetics (Thompson and Tarvlou\n2009).\n\nWithin philosophical aesthetics itself, the renewed interest in the\naesthetics of nature was also fueled by another development: the\npublication of Ronald Hepburn\u2019s seminal article\n\u201cContemporary Aesthetics and the Neglect of Natural\nBeauty\u201d (Hepburn 1966). Hepburn\u2019s essay is commonly\nrecognized as setting the agenda for the aesthetics of nature for the\nlate twentieth century (Brook 2010, Saito 2010, Sep\u00e4nmaa 2010,\nCarlson 2014b). After noting that by essentially reducing all of\naesthetics to philosophy of art, analytic aesthetics had virtually\nignored the natural world, Hepburn argued that aesthetic appreciation\nof art frequently provides misleading models for the appreciation of\nnature. However, he nonetheless observed that there is in the\naesthetic appreciation of nature, as in the appreciation of art, a\ndistinction between appreciation that is only trivial and superficial\nand that which is serious and deep. He furthermore suggested that for\nnature such serious appreciation might require new and different\napproaches that can accommodate not only nature\u2019s indeterminate\nand varying character, but also both our multi-sensory experience and\nour diverse understanding of it. By focusing attention on natural\nbeauty, Hepburn demonstrated that there could be significant\nphilosophical investigation of the aesthetic experience of the world\nbeyond the artworld. He thereby not only generated renewed interest in\nthe aesthetics of nature, he also laid foundations for environmental\naesthetics in general as well as for the aesthetics of everyday\nlife.\n\nIn the wake of Hepburn\u2019s article, the next major developments in\nthe emerging field of environmental aesthetics challenged both the\nidea that nature appreciation is not aesthetic and the persistence of\nart-oriented approaches to the aesthetic appreciation of nature.\nAlthough these views about the appreciation of nature had found some\ngrounding in analytic aesthetics\u2019 reduction of aesthetics to\nphilosophy of art, as art\u2019s monopoly on philosophical aesthetics\nbegan to weaken, they were increasing recognized to be deeply\ncounterintuitive. Concerning the former, many of our fundamental\nparadigms of aesthetic experience seem to be instances of appreciation\nof nature, such as our delight in a sunset or in a bird in flight.\nMoreover, the Western tradition in aesthetics, as well as other\ntraditions, such as the Japanese, has long been committed to doctrines\nthat explicitly contradict the nonaesthetic conception of nature\nappreciation, such as the conviction that, as one philosopher\nexpressed it, anything that can be viewed can be viewed aesthetically\n(Ziff 1979). Concerning the art-oriented models, it was argued by some\nthat such approaches do not fully realize serious, appropriate\nappreciation of nature, but rather distort the true character of\nnatural environments. For example, the landscape model recommends\nframing and flattening environments into scenery. Moreover, in\nfocusing heavily on artistic qualities, these accounts are thought to\nneglect much of our normal experience and understanding of nature\n(Hepburn 1966 1993, Carlson 1979 2000, Berleant 1985 1988 1992, Saito\n1998a 1998b). The problem, in short, is that they do not acknowledge\nthe importance of aesthetically appreciating nature, as one\naesthetician puts it, \u201cas nature\u201d (Budd 2002).\n3. Basic Orientations in Environmental Aesthetics\n\nAfter the emergence of environmental aesthetics as a significant area\nof philosophical research, some initial positions crystallized. In the\nlast part of the last century, these positions developed distinct\norientations concerning the aesthetic appreciation of natural\nenvironments. At that time, the positions were frequently\ndistinguished as belonging in one or the other of two groups,\nalternatively labeled cognitive and non-cognitive (Godlovitch 1994,\nEaton 1998, Carlson and Berleant 2004), conceptual and non-conceptual\n(Moore 1999), or narrative and ambient (Foster 1998). The distinction\nmarks a division between those points of view that take knowledge and\ninformation to be essential to aesthetic appreciation of environments\nand those that take some other feature, such as engagement, emotion\narousal, or imagination, to be paramount. The distinction thereby\ngives structure and organization to the diverse points of view\nrepresented in the field. Moreover, it is in line with similar\ndistinctions used in aesthetic theory concerning the appreciation of\nart, music, and literature.\n3.1 Cognitive Views\n\nWhat are called cognitive, conceptual, or narrative positions in\nenvironmental aesthetics are united by the thought that knowledge and\ninformation about the nature of the object of appreciation is central\nto its aesthetic appreciation. Thus, they champion the idea that\nnature must be appreciated, as one author puts it, \u201con its own\nterms\u201d (Saito 1998b). These positions tend to reject aesthetic\napproaches to environments, such as that governed by the idea of the\npicturesque, that draw heavily on the aesthetic experience of art for\nmodeling the appreciation of nature. Yet they affirm that art\nappreciation can nonetheless show some of what is required in an\nadequate account of nature appreciation. For example, in serious,\nappropriate aesthetic appreciation of works of art, it is taken to be\nessential that we experience works as what they in fact are and in\nlight of knowledge of their real natures. Thus, for instance,\nappropriate appreciation of a work such as Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica (1937) requires that we experience it as a painting\nand moreover as a cubist painting, and therefore that we appreciate it\nin light of our knowledge of paintings in general and of cubist\npaintings in particular (Walton 1970). Adopting this general line of\nthought, one cognitive approach to nature appreciation, sometimes\nlabeled the natural environmental model (Carlson 1979) or scientific\ncognitivism (Parsons 2002), holds that just as serious, appropriate\naesthetic appreciation of art requires knowledge of art history and\nart criticism, such aesthetic appreciation of nature requires\nknowledge of natural history\u2014the knowledge provided by the\nnatural sciences and especially sciences such as geology, biology, and\necology. The idea is that scientific knowledge about nature can reveal\nthe actual aesthetic qualities of natural objects and environments in\nthe way in which knowledge about art history and art criticism can for\nworks of art. In short, to appropriately aesthetically appreciate\nnature \u201con its own terms\u201d is to appreciate it as it is\ncharacterized by natural science (Carlson 1981 2000 2007, Rolston\n1995, Eaton 1998, Matthews 2002, Parsons 2002 2006b).\n\nOther cognitive or quasi-cognitive accounts of the aesthetic\nappreciation of environments differ from scientific cognitivism\nconcerning either the kind of cognitive resources taken to be relevant\nto such appreciation or the degree to which these resources are\nconsidered relevant. On the one hand, several cognitive approaches\nemphasize different kinds of information, claiming that appreciating\nnature \u201con its own terms\u201d might well involve experiencing\nit in light of various cultural and historical traditions. Thus, in\nappropriate aesthetic appreciation, local and regional narratives,\nfolklore, and even mythological stories about nature are endorsed\neither as complementary with or as alternative to scientific knowledge\n(Sep\u00e4nmaa 1993, Saito 1998b, Heyd 2001). On the other hand,\nanother at least quasi-cognitive approach strongly supports the idea\nthat nature must be appreciated \u201cas nature\u201d, but does not\ngo beyond that constraint. The justification for accepting the\n\u201cas nature\u201d restriction is that the aesthetic experience\nof nature should be true to what nature actually is. This, however, is\nthe extent of the approach\u2019s commitment to cognitivism and marks\nthe limits of the similarity that it finds between art appreciation\nand the appreciation of nature. It rejects the idea that scientific\nknowledge about nature can reveal the actual aesthetic qualities of\nnatural objects and environments in the way in which knowledge about\nart history and art criticism can for works of art. Moreover, it holds\nthat, unlike the case with art, many of the most significant aesthetic\ndimensions of natural objects and environments are extremely relative\nto conditions of observation. The upshot is that aesthetic\nappreciation of nature is taken to allow a degree of freedom that is\ndenied to the aesthetic appreciation of art (Fisher 1998, Budd\n2002).\n3.2 Non-cognitive Views\n\nStanding in contrast to the cognitive positions in environmental\naesthetics are several so-called non-cognitive, non-conceptual, or\nambient approaches. However, \u201cnon-cognitive\u201d here should\nnot be taken in its older philosophical sense, as meaning primarily or\nonly \u201cemotive\u201d. Rather it indicates simply that these\nviews hold that something other than a cognitive component, such as\nscientific knowledge or cultural tradition, is the central feature of\nthe aesthetic appreciation of environments. The leading non-cognitive\napproach, called the aesthetics of engagement, draws on phenomenology\nas well as on analytic aesthetics. In doing so, it rejects many of the\ntraditional ideas about aesthetic appreciation not only for nature but\nalso for art. It argues that the theory of disinterestedness involves\na mistaken analysis of the concept of the aesthetic and that this is\nmost evident in the aesthetic experience of natural environments.\nAccording to the engagement approach, disinterested appreciation, with\nits isolating, distancing, and objectifying gaze, is out of place in\nthe aesthetic experience of nature, for it wrongly abstracts both\nnatural objects and appreciators from the environments in which they\nproperly belong and in which appropriate appreciation is achieved.\nThus, the aesthetics of engagement stresses the contextual dimensions\nof nature and our multi-sensory experiences of it. Viewing the\nenvironment as a seamless unity of places, organisms, and perceptions,\nit challenges the importance of traditional dichotomies, such as that\nbetween subject and object. It beckons appreciators to immerse\nthemselves in the natural environment and to reduce to as small a\ndegree as possible the distance between themselves and the natural\nworld. In short, appropriate aesthetic experience is held to involve\nthe total immersion of the appreciator in the object of appreciation\n(Berleant 1985 1988 1992 2013b).\n\nOther non-cognitive positions in environmental aesthetics contend that\ndimensions other than engagement are central to aesthetic experience.\nWhat is known as the arousal model holds that we may appreciate nature\nsimply by opening ourselves to it and being emotionally aroused by it.\nOn this view, this less intellectual, more visceral experience of\nnature constitutes a legitimate way of aesthetically appreciating it\nthat does not require any knowledge gained from science or elsewhere\n(Carroll 1993). Another alternative similarly argues that neither\nscientific nor any other kind of knowledge facilitates real,\nappropriate appreciation of nature, but not because such appreciation\nneed involve only emotional arousal, but rather because nature itself\nis essentially alien, aloof, distant, and unknowable. This position,\nwhich may be called the mystery model, contends that appropriate\nexperience of nature incorporates a sense of being separate from\nnature and of not belonging to it\u2014a sense of mystery involving a\nstate of appreciative incomprehension (Godlovitch 1994). A fourth\nnon-cognitive approach brings together several features thought to be\nrelevant to nature appreciation. It attempts to balance engagement and\nthe traditional idea of disinterestedness, while giving center stage\nto imagination. This approach distinguishes a number of different\nkinds of imagination\u2014associative, metaphorical, exploratory,\nprojective, ampliative, and revelatory. It also responds to concerns\nthat imagination introduces subjectivity by appealing to factors such\nas guidance by the object of appreciation, the constraining role of\ndisinterestedness, and the notion of \u201cimagining well\u201d\n(Brady 1998 2003). A related point of view, which stresses the\nmetaphysical dimensions of imagination, might also be placed in the\nnon-cognitive group, although doing so requires making certain\nassumptions about the cognitive content of metaphysical speculation.\nAccording to this account, the imagination interprets nature as\nrevealing metaphysical insights: insights about things such as the\nmeaning of life, the human condition, or our place in the cosmos.\nThus, this point of view includes within appropriate aesthetic\nexperience of nature those abstract meditations and ruminations about\nultimate reality that our encounters with nature sometimes engender\n(Hepburn 1996).\n4. Environmental Aesthetics beyond Natural Environments\n\nSince they first took form in the late twentieth century, the initial\npositions in environmental aesthetics expanded from their original\nfocus on natural environments to consider human and human-influenced\nenvironments. At the same time, the discipline has also come to\ninclude the examination of that which falls within such environments,\ngiving rise to what is called the aesthetics of everyday life. This\narea involves the aesthetics of not only more common objects and\nenvironments, but also a range of everyday activities. Concerning both\nthe aesthetics of human environments and the aesthetics of everyday\nlife, approaches that combine the resources of both cognitive and\nnon-cognitive points of views have become more common and seem\nespecially fruitful.\n4.1 The Aesthetics of Human Environments\n\nBoth the cognitive and the non-cognitive orientations in environmental\naesthetics have resources that are brought to bear on the aesthetic\ninvestigation of human and human-influenced environments. Of the\ninitial positions, some non-cognitive approaches have made the most\nsubstantial contributions to this area of research. The aesthetics of\nengagement is particularly significant in this regard, constituting a\nmodel for the aesthetic appreciation not simply of both nature and\nart, but also of every other aspect of human experience; it studies\nthe aesthetic dimensions of rural countrysides, small towns, large\ncities, theme parks, gardens, museums, and even human relationships.\nMoreover, although, as is clear from the early collections of essays\nin environmental aesthetics (Kemal and Gaskell 1993, Carlson and\nBerleant 2004), the field initially concentrated on natural\nenvironments, the aesthetics of engagement, unlike most other\napproaches, from very early on focused not simply on natural\nenvironments, but also on human environments and especially on urban\nenvironments (Berleant 1978 1984 1986). Much of this material is\navailable in more recently published volumes (Berleant 1997 2004 2005\n2010b 2012). It has become a foundation for a substantial body of\nresearch on the aesthetic appreciation of urban and as well as other\nkinds of environments (Haapala 1998, von Bonsdorff 2002, Blanc 2013,\nPaetzold 2013, Alvarez 2017). Other non-cognitive accounts, such as\nthat which stresses imagination, likewise illuminate our aesthetic\nresponses to a range of human environments as well as to our use of\nthem for purposes such as resource extraction and agricultural\nproduction (Brady 2003 2006).\n\nCognitive accounts also investigate the aesthetic appreciation of\nhuman environments, arguing that, as with natural environments,\nappropriate appreciation depends on knowledge of what something is,\nwhat it is like, and why it is as it is. Scientific cognitivism claims\nthat for human environments knowledge provided by the social sciences,\nespecially history, is equally as relevant to aesthetic appreciation\nas that given by the natural sciences (Carlson 2009). For appropriate\nappreciation of rural and urban environments, as well as specialized\nenvironments such as those of industry and agriculture, what is needed\nis information about their histories, their functions, and their roles\nin our lives (Carlson 1985 2001, Parsons 2008b, Parsons and Carlson\n2008). Other approaches emphasize the aesthetic potential of cultural\ntraditions, which seem especially relevant to the appreciation of what\nmight be termed cultural landscapes\u2014environments that constitute\nimportant places in the cultures and histories of particular groups of\npeople. What is often called a sense of place, together with ideas and\nimages from folklore, mythology, and religion, frequently plays a\nsignificant role in individuals\u2019 aesthetic experience of their\nown home landscapes (Saito 1985, Sep\u00e4nmaa 1993, Carlson 2000,\nSandrisser 2007, Firth 2008, Nomikos 2018).\n\nFruitful approaches to the aesthetic appreciation of human\nenvironments can also be found in views that draw on both cognitive\nand non-cognitive points of view. There have been attempts to\nexplicitly forge connections between the two orientations (Foster\n1998, Moore 1999 2008, Fudge 2001), and there are several collections\nand studies that, moving beyond the cognitive/non-cognitive\ndistinction, inform our understanding of the appreciation of an array\nof environments and address issues that arise concerning them\n(Berleant and Carlson 2007, Arntzen and Brady 2008, Herrington 2009,\nBrady et al 2018). There are investigations of both rural\nlandscapes (Sep\u00e4nmaa 2005, von Bonsdorff 2005, Andrews 2007,\nBenson 2008, Leddy 2008, Brook 2013, Benovsky 2016) and urban\ncityscapes (von Bonsdorff 2002, Macauley 2007, Sep\u00e4nmaa 2007,\nErzen and Milani 2013, Frydryczak 2015) as well as more specialized\nenvironments, such as industrial sites (Saito 2004, Maskit 2007, Kover\n2014), shopping centers (Brottman 2007), restored and rewilded\nenvironments (Heyd 2002, Prior and Brady 2017, Brady et al\n2018), and even environments after the end of nature (Vogel 2015).\nBeyond the consideration of these larger, more public environments,\nthe aesthetics of everyday life becomes especially relevant.\n4.2 The Aesthetics of Everyday Life\n\nThe aesthetics of everyday life tends to focus on the aesthetics of\nsmaller environments as well as the common objects and the everyday\nactivities that occupy such environments. Thus it investigates not\nonly the aesthetic qualities of more personal environments, such as\nindividual living spaces, for example, yards and houses (Melchionne\n1998 2002, Lee 2010), but also the aesthetic dimensions of normal\nday-to-day experiences (Leddy 1995 2005b 1012b, Saito 2001 2008 2012\n2017b, Haapala 2005, Irvin 2008a 2008b, Mandoki 2010, Maskit 2011).\nMoreover, it explores the aesthetic aspects of somewhat more\nspecialized and perhaps uniquely human interests and activities, such\nas the appreciation of the human body (Davies 2014, Irvin 2016b, Saito\n2016), of sports (Welsch 2005, Edgar 2013), and of food, cuisine, and\ndining (Korsmeyer 1999, Sweeney 2017, Ravasio 2018). There are major\nmonographs that address the general topic of the aesthetics of\neveryday life (Mandoki 2007, Saito 2008 2017a, Leddy 2012b) as well as\nseveral collections (von Bonsdorff and Haapala 1999, Light and Smith\n2005, Yuedi and Carter 2014a, Irvin 2016a) that pursue particular\nareas of interest and thus yield insight into and encourage the\nappreciation of almost every aspect of human life. However, although\nthese various lines of research are clearly very productive, the\ncredentials of the aesthetics of everyday life as an investigation of\ngenuine aesthetic experiences have been challenged, debated, and\ndefended (Dowling 2010, Melchionne 2011 2013 2014, Leddy 2012a 2014\n2015, Naukkarinen 2013 2017, Carlson 2014a, Davies 2015, Puolakka\n2018).\n\nNonetheless, in spite of these challenges and concerns about the\naesthetics of everyday life, when it turns to the investigation of\nthings such as sports and food, it begins to come full circle,\nconnecting environmental aesthetics back to more traditional\naesthetics and to the study of clearly genuine aesthetic experiences.\nBy way of the aesthetics of everyday life, together with the\naesthetics of human environments, environmental aesthetics makes\ncontact with the artistic activities involved not only in sports and\ncuisine, but also in gardening (Miller 1993, Saito 1996, Carlson 1997,\nRoss 1998, Cooper 2006, Parsons 2008a, Chung 2018, Brady et\nal 2018) and in landscaping, architecture, and design (Stecker\n1999, Carlson 2000, Parsons 2008b 2011 2016, Forsey, 2013, Svabo and\nEkelund 2015, van Etteger et al 2016). In addition, and now\nwithin the context of environmental aesthetics, traditional art forms,\nsuch as poetry and literature (Berleant 1991 2004, Ross 1998,\nSep\u00e4nmaa 2004) and painting, sculpture, dance, and music\n(Berleant 1991 2004, Ross 1998, Mullis 2014) as well as newer forms,\nsuch as environmental art (Crawford 1983, Carlson 1986, Ross 1993,\nBrady 2007, Brook 2007, Fisher 2007, Lintott 2007, Parsons 2008a,\nSimus 2008b, Brady et al 2018, Nannicelli 2018), are explored\nand re-explored\u2014both as aesthetically significant dimensions of\nour everyday experiences and concerning their roles in shaping our\naesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments. (For\nmore detailed consideration of the aesthetics of everyday life, see\nthe SEP entry on the Aesthetics of the Everyday.)\n5. Environmental Aesthetics, Environmentalism, and Future Directions\n\nTogether with wider scope of environmental aesthetics, including both\nthe aesthetics of human environments and the aesthetics of everyday\nlife, the twenty-first century has also given rise to renewed\ninvestigations of the relationship between environmental aesthetics\nand environmentalism. This relationship has been increasingly\nscrutinized, resulting in criticism of earlier work on the aesthetics\nof nature as well as detailed assessments of contemporary positions.\nHand in hand with these developments have come several new interests\nand directions.\n5.1 Environmental Aesthetics and Environmentalism\n\nThe relationships between contemporary environmentalism and the\npositions and ideas of environmental aesthetics have sources in the\naesthetics of nature developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. As noted, early environmental movements, especially in\nNorth America, were fueled by a mode of aesthetic appreciation shaped\nnot only by the notion of the picturesque but also by ideas developed\nby thinkers such as Muir (Hargrove 1979, Callicott 1994, Wattles 2013,\nBrady 2018). However, more recently the relationship between\nenvironmental aesthetics and environmentalism has seemed somewhat more\nproblematic (Carlson 2010). Some individuals interested in the\nconservation and protection of both natural and human heritage\nenvironments have not found in traditional aesthetics of nature the\nresources that they believe are needed in order to carry out an\nenvironmentalist agenda (Loftis 2003). Others investigate problems\nposed by environments with unique features, such as isolation, for it\nis seemingly difficult to justify on aesthetic grounds the\npreservation of natural environments that are isolated such as to be\nessentially hidden from human aesthetic appreciation (Parsons\n2015). The problem is especially acute concerning environments, such\nas wetlands, that do not fit conventional conceptions of scenic beauty\n(Rolston 2000, Callicott 2003). Moreover, in line with earlier\ncriticisms that much of the empirical work in landscape assessment and\nplanning was focused only on scenic, picturesque environments, much of\nthe historical tradition concerning the aesthetic appreciation of\nnature has been called into question. Various themes in the aesthetics\nof nature, such as appreciation grounded in the idea of the\npicturesque, have been criticized in a number of ways: as\nanthropocentric (Godlovitch 1994), scenery-obsessed (Saito 1998a),\ntrivial (Callicott 1994), subjective (Thompson 1995), and/or morally\nvacuous (Andrews 1998). Similarly, in agreement with the aesthetics of\nengagement\u2019s critique of the theory of disinterestedness, some\nfind that concept to be questionable from an environmental standpoint\n(Rolston 1998).\n\nThere are a variety of responses to these kinds of criticisms of\ntraditional aesthetics of nature and of the notions of\ndisinterestedness and the picturesque. Some reassess and defend the\nidea of the picturesque, arguing that it, as well as some other\naspects of the eighteenth century tradition, has been misunderstood by\nsome contemporary aestheticians (Brook 2008, Paden et al\n2013, Paden 2013 2015a 2015b, Earle 2015). Others turn to the\ninvestigation of the long neglected member of the original\neighteenth-century triumvirate of the beautiful, the sublime, and the\npicturesque, finding in the sublime new resources for approaching the\naesthetic appreciation of the natural world (Brady 2012 2013, Shapshay\n2013, Mahoney 2016). However, whatever the final verdict about the\nsignificance of the picturesque and the sublime, the resources of\nnon-cognitive approaches, especially the aesthetics of engagement, are\ntaken to counter the criticisms that, due to the influence of ideas\nsuch as that of the picturesque, aesthetic experience of nature must\nbe both anthropocentric and scenery-obsessed (Rolston 1998 2002). The\ncharge of anthropocentricity is also explicitly addressed by the\nmystery approach, which attempts to give aesthetic appreciation of\nnature an \u201cacentric\u201d basis (Godlovitch 1994). Concerning\nthe concept of disinterestedness, some philosophers yet hold the view\nthat some form of the theory of disinterestedness is essential, since\nwithout it the notion of the aesthetic itself lacks conceptual\ngrounding (Budd 2002), while others claim that an analysis of\naesthetic experience in terms of the concept of disinterestedness\nhelps to meet the charges that traditional aesthetics is\nanthropocentric and subjective, since such an analysis supports the\nobjectivity of aesthetic judgments (Brady 2003). Similarly, cognitive\naccounts also furnish replies to some of these charges. Scientific\ncognitivism in particular, with its focus on scientific knowledge such\nas that given by geology and ecology, is claimed to help meet the\nworry that aesthetic appreciation of environments is of little\nsignificance in environmental conservation and preservation since\naesthetic appreciation is trivial and subjective (Hettinger 2005,\nParsons 2006a 2008a). Nonetheless, the extent to which scientific\ncognitivism and related ecology-dependent views can successfully\naddress such problems and doubts concerning the appropriate aesthetic\nappreciation of both natural and human environments is also questioned\non various grounds (Budd 2002, Hettinger 2007, Berleant 2010a 2016,\nBannon 2011, Stecker 2012, Herguedas 2018, Mikkonen 2018).\n\nLike the movement toward more ecologically informed aesthetic\nappreciation, the line of thought that connects the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature with positive aesthetics has also been debated.\nThe contention that untouched, pristine nature has only or primarily\npositive aesthetic qualities has been related to scientific\ncognitivism by suggesting that linking the appreciation of nature to\nscientific knowledge explains how positive aesthetic appreciation is\nnurtured by a scientific worldview that increasingly interprets the\nnatural world as having positive aesthetic qualities, such as order,\nbalance, unity, and harmony (Carlson 1984). Other philosophers either\nsee the relationship between scientific cognitivism and positive\naesthetics somewhat conversely, arguing that the latter should just be\nassumed, in which case it provides support for the former (Parsons\n2002), or simply contend that the positive aesthetics tradition\nactually has much earlier roots than contemporary scientific\ncognitivism (Phemister and Strickland 2015). Nonetheless, however it\nis justified, some versions of the positive aesthetics position are\nsupported by several environmental philosophers (Rolston 1988,\nHargrove 1989, Hettinger 2017, Cheng 2017a), while others find it\nproblematic, either since it appears to undercut the possibility of\nthe kind of comparative assessments thought to be necessary for\nenvironmental planning and preservation (Thompson 1995, Godlovitch\n1998a) or because the idea itself seems unintuitive, obscure, and/or\ninadequately justified (Godlovitch 1998b, Saito 1998a, Budd 2002,\nStecker 2012). Even philosophers who are somewhat open to the idea of\npositive aesthetics have some reservations about its original\nformulation, arguing that it depends too heavily on a now out-dated\nconception of ecology and/or does not adequately stress an\nevolutionary understanding of nature as an essential component of\naesthetic appreciation (Simus 2008a, Paden et al 2012, Paden\n2015a 2016). Such considerations may point to a more plausible version\nof positive aesthetics.\n5.2 Environmental Aesthetics: New Interests and Future Directions\n\nIn spite of the above noted reservations about various cognitivist\napproaches, in light of the seeming relevance of natural sciences such\nas geology, biology, and especially ecology to the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature, scientific cognitivim is sometimes interpreted\nas \u201can ecological aesthetic\u201d in the tradition of Aldo\nLeopold, who linked the beauty of nature to ecological integrity and\nstability (Callicott 1994 2003, Gobster 1995). However, although it\nclearly has roots in Leopold\u2019s thought, the explicit idea of\necological aesthetics, or as it is sometimes called, ecoaesthetics,\nseems to have later origins (Meeker 1872, Koh 1988). Moreover,\nalthough the idea has had for some time a place within analytic\nenvironmental aesthetics, perhaps best filled by scientific\ncognitivism, more recently it has also been adopted by some\nphilosophers working in the \u201ccontinental tradition\u201d. For\nexample, it is claimed that although phenomenological work in\n\u201cecological aesthetics\u201d is \u201cstill in its\ninfancy\u201d, the work of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty is\napplicable to its development. Moreover, it is suggested that the\naesthetics of engagement is the first and currently the strongest\n\u201ccomprehensive phenomenological theory of ecological\naesthetics\u201d and that it in combination with scientific\ncognitivism would constitute a stronger ecological aesthetics\n(Toadvine 2010). There is also other recent research in environmental\naesthetics that draws, more or less, on both analytic and continental\ntraditions (Tafalla 2011, Leddy 2012b, Maskit 2014, Paetzold 2014,\nSeel 2015, J\u00f3hannesd\u00f3ttir 2016).\n\nThere is, in addition, considerable interest in environmental\naesthetics in the East, which likewise draws on both analytic and\ncontinental traditions as well as on Eastern philosophy (Cheng 2010\n2013b 2017b, Yuedi 2014, Chen 2015). Several different topics\nconcerning both natural and human environments are addressed in the\nrecent work in this area, which includes research not only by Eastern\nbut also by Western scholars (Xue 2008 2018, Xue and Carlson 2010,\nSaito 2014a, Aota 2016, Berleant 2013a 2016, Carlson 2017, Odin 2017,\nZeng Y. 2017, Brubaker 2018, Chung 2018, Parsons and Zhang 2018).\nThere are also some collections that contain relevant essays (Cheng\net al 2013, Yuedi and Carter 2014a, Callicott and McRae 2017,\nNguyen 2018) as well as some journal issues devoted especially to\nrecent work in Eastern aesthetics, for example, Critical\nTheory, 1, 2 (2017) and Contemporary Aesthetics, Special\nVolume 6 (2018). Within this body of work, perhaps the most dominate\narea of interest is ecological aesthetics, which is pursued by several\nChinese aestheticians, who have developed robust versions of\necoaesthetics (Cheng 2013a 2016, Zeng F. 2017). Other than the sources\ncited here, much of this work is available only in Chinese. However,\none prominent version of ecoaesthetics, which is accessible in\nEnglish, embraces, as the \u201cfour keystones of ecological\naesthetic appreciation\u201d, not only the centrality of ecological\nknowledge and the rejection of the duality of humanity and the natural\nworld, but also the over-arching value of ecosystem biodiversity and\nhealth and the continued guidance of ecological ethics (Cheng 2013c).\nWhile the first two of these four \u201ckeystones\u201d reflect\nscientific cognitivism and the aesthetics of engagement, the last two\ngo well beyond these Western positions. By placing ecosystem health\nand ecological ethics within the framework of ecoaesthetics, Chinese\necological aesthetics directly and powerfully addresses the question\nof the relationship between environmental aesthetics and environmental\nethics (Carlson 2018). This move is comparable to, and perhaps more\nsuccessful than, the attempts by Western aestheticians to bring\naesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments in line\nwith moral obligations to maintain environmental and ecological health\n(Rolston 1995, Eaton 1997 1998, Lintott 2006, Saito 2007 2008,\nVarandas 2015) and to forge strong positive links between aesthetic\nappreciation of nature and nature protection and preservation (Rolston\n2002, Brady 2003, Carlson and Lintott 2007, Parsons 2008a, Carlson\n2010, Lintott and Carlson 2014, Parsons 2018). Nonetheless, the degree\nto which aesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments\nand ethical considerations are related to one another continues to be\na matter of investigation, discussion, and debate (Loftis 2003, Bannon\n2011, Stecker 2012, Carlson 2018, Stewart and Johnson 2018).\n\nThe current research in environmental aesthetics that draws on the\ncontinental tradition and the extensive work on ecoaesthetics by\nEastern scholars are examples of the globalization of environmental\naesthetics. Recently there have been calls in both the East and the\nWest for the globalization of aesthetics in general (Li and Cauvel\n2006, Higgins 2017) and of environmental aesthetics in particular\n(Saito 2010, Yuedi and Carter 2014b). Such calls are vital to the\ncontinuing growth of the field, yet it is also important to note that,\nalthough work on ecoaesthetics within the continental tradition and\nits development in the East are relatively recent, environmental\naesthetics itself has long had a global orientation. Since its\ninception, there has been interest in the field by a wide range of\nscholars exploring different philosophical traditions and/or working\nin different countries. For example, drawing on continental philosophy\nis not new to environmental aesthetics (Berleant 1985). Likewise,\nthere was significant research on Japanese aesthetics of nature early\nin the development of environmental aesthetics (Saito 1985 1992 1996)\nwhich has continued into the present century (Saito 2002 2014a).\nAnother example is the research produced in Finland, where a number of\nconferences were hosted during the 1990s and 2000s, each followed by a\ncollection of articles, such as (Sep\u00e4nmaa and Heikkil\u00e4-Palo\n2005, Sep\u00e4nmaa et al 2007). Similarly, several\nconferences have been held in China in recent years, to which Western\nscholars have been invited and from which have followed collections of\narticles (Cheng et al 2013, Yuedi and Carter 2014a). Similar\ncollections have also published papers presented at conferences in\nEurope (Drenthen and Keulartz 2014) and in North America, from which\npapers are included in a recent special issue of the Journal of\nAesthetics and Art Criticism (Shapshay and Tenen 2018a). Another\nindication of the global appeal of environmental aesthetics is that\nmany articles and books in environmental aesthetics have been\ntranslated from English into a number of other languages, including\nseveral European languages as well as Korean and especially Chinese,\ninto which several of the basic Western texts in environmental\naesthetics have been translated. Moreover, this global appeal is\nfurther evidenced by the prolific research in the field currently\nbeing published in several different countries and languages. \n\nThe continuing globalization of environmental aesthetics as well as\nthe currently fruitful discussions both within and among the various\npoints of view represented in contemporary research, such as in\necoaesthetics, suggests that the work that is most productive for\npromoting and supporting the aesthetic appreciation and preservation\nof all kinds of environments, both natural and human, is that which\ndepends not simply on any one particular approach to environmental\naesthetics, but rather on attempts to bring together the resources of\nseveral different orientations and traditions (Nassauer 1997, Lintott\n2006, Carlson 2009, Moore 2008, Cheng et al 2013, Carlson\n2018). For example, in addition to the Chinese research in\necoaesthetics, there are, as noted, similar efforts by Western\nscholars to combine elements of cognitive and non-cognitive points of\nview (Rolston 1998 2002, Saito 2007, Toadvine 2010). Moreover, many\nthinkers explore other topics that they constructively relate to\nenvironmental aesthetics, for instance, feminist theory (Lee 2006,\nLintott 2010, Lintott and Irvin 2016), political and social issues\n(Berleant 2005 2012, Ross 2005, Simus 2008b, McShane 2018, Saito\n2018), philosophy of biology (Parsons and Carlson 2008), animal\ntreatment and protection (Parsons 2007, Hettinger 2010, Semczyszyn\n2013, Brady 2014a, Tafalla 2017, Cross 2018), weather and climate\nchange (Brady 2014b, Diaconu 2015, Nomikos 2018), and, perhaps most\nimportant, the enrichment of the quality of human life (Saito 2017a\n2018, Jamieson 2018). This kind of work can also pursue the\napplication of these and related topics to environmental policy and\npractice (Saito 2007, Berleant 2010b 2012, Parsons 2010, Sep\u00e4nmaa\n2010, Robinson and Elliott 2011, Cheng et al 2013, Brady\n2014b). In this way, these contributions continue to shape the future\ndirections of environmental aesthetics (Saito 2010 2014b, Blanc 2012,\nDrenthen and Keulartz 2014, Shapshay and Tenen 2018b). Such\ninnovative, eclectic approaches, coupled with the globalization of\nenvironmental aesthetics, will hopefully not only further a wide range\nof environmental goals and practices but also foster a deeper\nunderstanding and appreciation of the aesthetic potential of the world\nin which we live.\n",
