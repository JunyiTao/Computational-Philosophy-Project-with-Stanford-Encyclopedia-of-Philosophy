    "main_text": "Science, religion, and how they interrelate || What is science, and what is religion?\n1.2 What is science, and what is religion?\n\nIn order to understand the scope of science and religion and their\ninteractions, we must at least get a rough sense of what science and\nreligion are. After all, \u201cscience\u201d and\n\u201creligion\u201d are not eternally unchanging terms with\nunambiguous meanings. Indeed, they are terms that were coined\nrecently, with meanings that vary across contexts. Before the\nnineteenth century, the term \u201creligion\u201d was rarely used.\nFor a medieval author such as Aquinas, the term religio meant\npiety or worship, and was not applied to religious systems\noutside of what he considered orthodoxy (Harrison 2015). The term\n\u201creligion\u201d obtained its considerably broader current\nmeaning through the works of early anthropologists, such as E.B. Tylor\n(1871), who systematically used the term for religions across the\nworld. As a result, \u201creligion\u201d became a comparative\nconcept, referring to traits that could be compared and scientifically\nstudied, such as rituals, dietary restrictions, and belief systems\n(Jonathan Smith 1998).\n\nThe term \u201cscience\u201d as it is currently used also became\ncommon in the nineteenth century. Prior to this, what we call\n\u201cscience\u201d fell under the terminology of \u201cnatural\nphilosophy\u201d or, if the experimental part was emphasized,\n\u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d. William Whewell (1834)\nstandardized the term \u201cscientist\u201d to refer to\npractitioners of diverse natural philosophies. Philosophers of science\nhave attempted to demarcate science from other knowledge-seeking\nendeavors, in particular religion. For instance, Karl Popper (1959)\nclaimed that scientific hypotheses (unlike religious and philosophical\nones) are in principle falsifiable. Many authors (e.g., Taylor 1996)\naffirm a disparity between science and religion, even if the meanings\nof both terms are historically contingent. They disagree, however, on\nhow to precisely (and across times and cultures) demarcate the two\ndomains.\n\nOne way to distinguish between science and religion is the claim that\nscience concerns the natural world, whereas religion concerns the\nsupernatural world and its relationship to the natural. Scientific\nexplanations do not appeal to supernatural entities such as gods or\nangels (fallen or not), or to non-natural forces (such as miracles,\nkarma, or qi). For example, neuroscientists typically explain\nour thoughts in terms of brain states, not by reference to an\nimmaterial soul or spirit, and legal scholars do not invoke karmic\nload when discussing why people commit crimes.\n\nNaturalists draw a distinction between methodological\nnaturalism, an epistemological principle that limits scientific\ninquiry to natural entities and laws, and ontological or\nphilosophical naturalism, a metaphysical principle that rejects\nthe supernatural (Forrest 2000). Since methodological naturalism is\nconcerned with the practice of science (in particular, with the kinds\nof entities and processes that are invoked), it does not make any\nstatements about whether or not supernatural entities exist. They\nmight exist, but lie outside of the scope of scientific investigation.\nSome authors (e.g., Rosenberg 2014) hold that taking the results of\nscience seriously entails negative answers to such persistent\nquestions into the existence of free will or moral knowledge. However,\nthese stronger conclusions are controversial.\n\nThe view that science can be demarcated from religion in its\nmethodological naturalism is more commonly accepted. For instance, in\nthe Kitzmiller versus Dover trial, the philosopher of science Robert\nPennock was called to testify by the plaintiffs on whether Intelligent\nDesign was a form of creationism, and therefore religion. If it were,\nthe Dover school board policy would violate the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Building on\nearlier work (e.g., Pennock 1998), Pennock argued that Intelligent\nDesign, in its appeal to supernatural mechanisms, was not\nmethodologically naturalistic, and that methodological naturalism is\nan essential component of science. \n\nMethodological naturalism is a recent development in the history of\nscience, though we can see precursors of it in medieval authors such\nas Aquinas who attempted to draw a theological distinction\nbetween miracles, such as the working of relics, and unusual natural\nphenomena, such as magnetism and the tides (see Perry & Ritchie\n2018). Natural and experimental philosophers such as Isaac Newton,\nJohannes Kepler, Robert Hooke, and Robert Boyle regularly appealed to\nsupernatural agents in their natural philosophy (which we now call\n\u201cscience\u201d). Still, overall there was a tendency to favor\nnaturalistic explanations in natural philosophy. The X-club was a\nlobby group for the professionalization of science founded in 1864 by\nThomas Huxley and friends. While the X-club may have been in part\nmotivated by the desire to remove competition by amateur-clergymen\nscientists in the field of science, and thus to open up the field to\nfull-time professionals, its explicit aim was to promote a science\nthat would be free from religious dogma (Garwood 2008, Barton 2018).\nThis preference for naturalistic causes may have been encouraged by\npast successes of naturalistic explanations, leading authors such as\nPaul Draper (2005) to argue that the success of methodological\nnaturalism could be evidence for ontological naturalism. \n",
