    "main_text": "Complex epistemic interactions || Examples of action models\n3.2 Examples of action models\n\nWe saw the example of a completely private announcement in\n Figure 3,\n a complex action in which one agent learns something without the\nother agents even suspecting that this is so. Before devising an\naction model for another similarly complicated action, let us return\nto our most basic action: the public announcement of p. The\nidea of this action is that all agents receive the information that\np is true, and this is common knowledge. So to construct an\naction model for this action, we need only one event e that\nconveys the announcement that p is true, and the occurrence of\nthis event should be common knowledge. This leads us immediately to\nthe action model \\(\\Pub(p)\\) pictured in Figure 4. \n\n\n\n\\(\\Pub(p)\\)\n\n\nFigure 4: The pointed action model\n\\((\\Pub(p),e)\\) for the public announcement of p. \n\n\nIt is not difficult to see that \\(\\Pub(p)\\) is just what we want:\nevent e conveys the desired announcement and the reflexive\narrows for each agent make it so that this event is common knowledge.\nIt is important to note that in virtue of the fact that we can\nconstruct an action model for public announcements, it follows that\naction models are a generalization of public announcements. \n\nWe now turn to a more complicated action: the semi-private\nannouncement of p to agent a (sometimes called the\n\u201csemi-public announcement\u201d of p to agent a).\nThe idea of this action is that agent a is told that p\nis true, the other agents know that a is told the truth value\nof p, but these other agents do not know what it is exactly\nthat a is told. This suggests an action model with two events,\none for each thing that a might be told: an event e that\nannounces p and event f that announces \\(\\lnot p\\).\nAgent a is to know which event occurs, whereas all other agents\nare to be uncertain as to which event occurs. This leads us to the\naction model \\(\\frac12\\Pri_a(p)\\) pictured in Figure 5. \n\n\n\n\\(\\frac12\\Pri_a(p)\\)\n\n\nFigure 5: The pointed action model\n\\((\\frac12\\Pri_a(p),e)\\) for the semi-private announcement of p\nto agent a. \n\n\nWe see that \\(\\frac12\\Pri_a(p)\\) satisfies just what we want: the\nactual event that occurs is the point e (the announcement of\nthe precondition p), agent a knows this, but all other\nagents consider it possible that either e (the announcement of\np) or f (the announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\)) occurred.\nFurthermore, the other agents know that a knows which event was\nthe case (since at each of the events e and f that they\nconsider possible, agent a knows the event that occurs). This\nis just what we want of a semi-private announcement. \n\nFinally, let us consider a much more challenging action: the\nmisleading private announcement of p to agent a. The\nidea of this action is that agent a is told p in a\ncompletely private manner but all other agents are misled into\nbelieving that a received the private announcement of \\(\\lnot\np\\) instead. So to construct an action model for this, we need a few\nelements: events for the private announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\) to\na that the non-a agents mistakenly believe occurs and an\nevent for the actual announcement of p that only a knows\noccurs. As for the events for the private announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\),\nit follows by a simple modification of\n Figure 3\n that the private announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\) to agent a is the\naction \\((\\Pri_a(\\lnot p),e)\\) pictured as follows: \n\n\n\n\\(\\Pri_a(\\lnot p)\\)\n\n\n\nSince the other agents are to believe that the above action occurs,\nthey should believe it is event e that occurs. However, they\nare mistaken: what actually does occur is a new event g that\nconveys to a the private information that p is true.\nTaken together, we obtain the action \\((\\MPri_a(p),g)\\) pictured in\nFigure 6. \n\n\n\n\\(\\MPri_a(p)\\)\n\n\nFigure 6: The pointed action model\n\\((\\MPri_a(p),g)\\) for the misleading private announcement of p\nto agent a. \n\n\nLooking at \\(\\MPri_a(p)\\), we see that if we were to to delete event\ng (and all arrows to and from g), then we would obtain\n\\(\\Pri_a(\\lnot p)\\). So events e and f in \\(\\MPri_a(p)\\)\nplay the role of representing the \u201cmisdirection\u201d the\nnon-a agents experience: the private announcement of \\(\\lnot\np\\) to agent a. However, it is event g that actually\noccurs: this event conveys to a that p is true while\nmisleading the other agents into believing that it is event e,\nthe event corresponding to the private announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\) to\na, that occurs. In sum, a receives the information that\np is true while the other agents are mislead into believing\nthat a received the private announcement of \\(\\lnot p\\). One\nconsequence of this is that non-a agents come to hold the\nfollowing beliefs: \\(\\lnot p\\) is true, agent a knows this, and\nagent a believes the others believe that no new propositional\ninformation was provided. These beliefs are all incorrect. The\nnon-a agents are therefore highly mislead. \n",
