    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nWe begin with an illustration of the paradox with concrete data. The\nnumbers in\n Table 1\n summarize the effect of a medical treatment for the overall\npopulation (N = 52), and separately for men and women:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Population, \\(\\bf N=52\\)\nMen \\(\\bf(\\r{M})\\), \\(\\bf N=20\\)\nWomen \\(\\bf(\\neg \\r{M})\\), \\(\\bf N=32\\) \n\n\nSuccess \\(\\bf(\\r{S})\\) \n Failure \\(\\bf(\\neg \\r{S})\\) \n Success Rate\n Success \n Failure \n Success Rate\n Success \n Failure \n Success Rate \n\nTreatment (T) \n 20 \n 20 \n 50% \n 8 \n 5 \n \u2248 61% \n 12 \n 15 \n \u2248 44%  \n\nControl\n\n(\u00acT)\n 6 \n 6 \n 50% \n 4 \n 3 \n \u2248 57% \n 2 \n 3 \n \u2248 40%  \n\n\nTable 1: Simpson's Paradox: the type of\nassociation at the population level (positive, negative, independent)\nchanges at the level of subpopulations. Numbers taken from\nSimpson\u2019s original example (1951).\n\n\nFor matters of exposition, we assume that these frequencies are\nunbiased estimates of the underlying probabilities. The treatment\nlooks ineffective at the level of the overall population, but it leads\nto higher success percentages than the control both for men and for\nwomen (61% vs. 57% for men and 44% vs. 40% for women). Writing these\nproportions as conditional probabilities, with \\(\\r{T}\\)=treatment,\n\\(\\r{S}\\)=success/recovery, and \\(\\r{M}\\)=male subpopulation, we\nobtain  \n\n\\[  p(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T}) = p(\\r{S}\\mid \\neg \\r{T}) \\]\n\n\nbut at the same time,  \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  p(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T}, \\r{M}) & \\gt p(\\r{S}\\mid  \\neg \\r{T}, \\r{M} )  \\\\\n  p(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{M}) &\\gt p(\\r{S}\\mid  \\neg \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{M}) \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nShould we use the treatment or not? When we know the gender of the\npatient, we would presumably administer the treatment, whereas it does\nnot look like the right thing to do when we don\u2019t know the\npatient\u2019s gender\u2014although we know that the patient is\neither male or female!\n\nThis phenomenon was first pointed out in papers by Karl G. Pearson\n(1899) and George U. Yule (1903), but it was Simpson\u2019s short\npaper \u201cThe interpretation of interaction in contingency\ntables\u201d (1951), discussing the interpretation of such\nassociation reversals, that led to the phenomenon being labeled as\n\u201cSimpson\u2019s Paradox\u201d. The phenomenon is, however,\nbroader than independence in the overall population and positive\nassociation in the subpopulations; for example, the associations may\nalso be reversed. Nagel and Cohen (1934: ch. 16) provide an example of\nsuch a reversal as part of a exercise for logic students.\n\nUnderstanding the paradox is essential for drawing the proper\nconclusions from statistical data. To give a recent example involving\nthe paradox (K\u00fcgelgen, Gresele, & Sch\u00f6lkopf [see\n Other Internet Resources]),\n early data revealed that the case fatality rate for Covid-19 was\nhigher in Italy than in China overall. Yet within every age group the\nfatality rate was higher in China than in Italy. One thus appears to\nget opposite conclusions about the comparative severity of the virus\nin the countries depending on whether one compares the whole\npopulations or the age-partitioned populations. Having a proper\nanalysis of what is going on is such cases is thus crucial for using\nstatistics to inform policy.\n\nIn what follows,\n Section 2\n explains different varieties of the paradox, clarifies the logical\nrelationships between them, and identifies precise conditions for when\nthe paradox can occur. While that section focuses on the mathematical\ncharacterization of the paradox,\n Section 3\n focuses on its role in causal inference, its implications for\nprobabilistic theories of causality, and its analysis by means of\ncausal models based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs: Spirtes,\nGlymour, & Scheines 2000; Pearl 2000 [2009]).\n\nBased on these different approaches,\n Section 4\n discusses different analyses of what makes Simpson\u2019s Paradox\nlook paradoxical, and what kind of error it reveals in human\nreasoning. This section also reports empirical findings on the\nprevalence of the paradox in reasoning and inference.\n Section 5\n surveys the occurrence and interpretation of the paradox in applied\nstatistics (regression models), philosophy of biology, decision theory\nand public policy. For example, Simpson\u2019s Paradox is relevant\nwhen analyzing data to test for race or gender discrimination (Bickel,\nHammel, & O\u2019Connell 1975).\n Section 6\n wraps up our findings and concludes.\n",
