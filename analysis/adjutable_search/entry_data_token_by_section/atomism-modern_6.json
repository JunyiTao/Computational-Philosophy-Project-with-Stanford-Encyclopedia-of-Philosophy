    "main_text": "Newtonian Atomism || Eighteenth-Century Developments in Newtonian Atomism\n3.2 Eighteenth-Century Developments in Newtonian Atomism\n\n\nForce was to prove a productive addition to experimental science in no\nuncertain manner in the eighteenth century. Force laws in addition to\nthe law of gravitation, involving elasticity, surface tension,\nelectric and magnetic attractions and so on were experimentally\nidentified and put to productive use. In the domain of science,\nscruples about the ontological status of forces were forgotten and\nthis attitude spread to philosophy. Eighteenth-century updates of\nmechanical atomism typically included gravity and other forces amongst\nthe primary properties of atoms. Acceptance of force as an ontological\nprimitive is evident in an extreme form in the 1763 reformulation of\nNewtonian atomism by R. Boscovich (1966). In his philosophy of matter\natoms became mere points (albeit possessing mass) acting as centres of\nforce, the forces varying with the distance from the centre and\noscillating between repulsive and attractive several times before\nbecoming the inverse square law of gravitation at sensible\ndistances. The various short-range attractive and repulsive forces\nwere appealed to as explanations of the cohesion of atoms in bulk\nmaterials, chemical combination and also elasticity. Short-range\nrepulsive forces varying with distance enabled Boscovich to remove the\ninstantaneous rebounds of atoms that had been identified as an\nincoherency in Newton's own atomism stemming from their absolute\nhardness and inelasticity.\n\n\nWhile most atomists were able to rid themselves of scruples about\naccepting forces as ontologically primitive, the issue of the empirical\nfoundation for the various unobservable forces hypothesised remained.\nThe best arguments that could be mounted were hypothetical-deductive.\nForces postulated at the atomic level were credited with some empirical\nsupport if they could serve to explain observable phenomena. The form\nof such arguments, as well as their inconclusiveness, can be\nillustrated by Newton's demonstration in the Principia\n(Bk. 2, Prop. 23) that a gas consisting of a static array of atoms\nrepelling each other with a force inversely proportional to their\nseparation would obey Boyle's law. The fact that some of these\ntheories did indeed reproduce the experimentally established facts was\ncertainly a point in their favour, but hardly served to establish them.\nWhewell brought the point home by identifying competing theories of\ncapillarity, due to Poisson and Laplace, that were equally able to\nreproduce the phenomena but which were based on incompatible atomic\nforce laws, as Gardner (1979, 20) has pointed out.\n\n\nThe problem besetting those seeking experimental support for atomic\ntheories is most evident in chemistry. Although many eighteenth-century\nchemists espoused versions of Newtonian chemistry their chemical\npractice owed nothing to it (Thackray, 1970). As philosophers they\npayed lip-service to atomism but as experimental chemists they worked\nindependently of it. As early as 1718 Ettienne Geoffroy spelt out how\nthe blossoming experimental science of chemical combination, involving\nextensive use of mineral acids to form an array of salts, could be\nunderstood in terms of what substances combined with what and could be\nrecovered from what and to what degree. His table of the degrees of\n\u2018rapport\u2019 of chemical substances for each other summarised\nexperimental data acquired by manipulating substances in the laboratory\nand became an efficient device for ordering chemical experience and for\nguiding the search for novel reactions. Klein (1995) has highlighted\nthis aspect of Geoffroy's work and how his 1718 paper in effect\nshows how a large section of the experimental chemistry of the time\ncould be construed as a practical tradition divorced from a speculative\nmetaphysics, atomistic or otherwise. Eighteenth-century tables of\naffinity, modelled on Geoffroy's version, became increasingly\ndetailed as the century proceeded. Many of the chemists who employed\nthem interpreted the affinities featuring in them as representing\nattractions between chemical atoms, but such an assumption added\nnothing that could not be fully represented in terms of combinations of\nchemical substances in the laboratory.\n\n\nThe fact that Newtonian atomism offered little that was of practical\nutility to chemistry became increasingly recognised by chemists as the\neighteenth century progressed. The culmination of the experimental\nprogram involving the investigation of the combination and analysis of\nchemical substances was, of course, Lavoisier's system involving\nchemical elements. But whatever sympathy Lavoisier may have had for\nNewtonian atomism of the kind championed by Laplace, he was at pains to\ndistance his new chemistry from it. Substances provisionally classified\nas elements were those that could not be broken down into something\nsimpler in the laboratory. Progress in eighteenth-century chemistry led\naway from rather than towards atomism. It was not until Dalton that the\nsituation changed early in the nineteenth century.\n\n\nThe assessment that eighteenth-century atomism was ill-confirmed by\nexperiment and failed to give useful guidance to experimentalists is a\njudgement that is fairly insensitive to what theory of confirmation one\nadopts or what one might require of an adequate scientific explanation.\nThis situation was transformed by the emergence of Daltonian atomism, a\nstrong candidate for the first atomic theory that had a productive link\nwith experiment.\n\nSuggested Reading: Thackray (1970) is an authoritative and\ndetailed account of Newton's atomism and its development in the\neighteenth century. The relation between Newton's atomism and his\nmechanics is discussed in Chalmers (2009, Chapter 7).\n",
