    "main_text": "Ethics and Rhetoric\n5. Ethics and Rhetoric\n\nOur knowledge of Philo\u2019s work in ethics comes almost entirely\nfrom an extended summary of an introductory book or lecture preserved\nwithout any context in an anthology (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7).\nThe summary is puzzling because it presents a picture of Philonian\nethics that seems too dogmatic, and too ordinary, for an Academic,\neven at the time of the Roman Books. The work presents a method for\nteaching ethics in terms of an analogy between philosophy and\nmedicine. This yields a division of ethical teaching into three parts:\na protreptic stage (showing the need for philosophical guidance), a\ntherapeutic stage (adjusting the student\u2019s evaluative concepts),\nand a preservative stage (outlining the life-styles and political\narrangements that promote or maintain happiness by reinforcing these\nadjusted concepts). This is intriguing as an example of the way in\nwhich late Hellenistic philosophers approached the teaching of\npractical ethics (see Annas 1993: 95\u201396. But it does not look\ninnovative. The analogy between medicine and philosophy is a standard\none in Plato and in Hellenistic ethics. The focus on practical rules\nand the application of technical divisions and sub-divisions is\nderived from the Stoic tradition. And its theoretical claims\u2014for\ninstance, that wisdom or knowledge is necessary for virtue, and that\nvirtue promotes the goal of happiness\u2014do not identify it as an\nexception to the mainstream tradition of weaker or stronger\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d and \u201ceudaemonist\u201d virtue\nethics. In these respects, the summary suggests that Philo\u2019s\nethics was largely unaffected by the wide-ranging and penetrating\ncriticisms of Hellenistic ethics by his Academic predecessors, and\nespecially by Carneades (examined in Algra 1997).\n\nBut there is reason to think that the summary\u2014which was probably\nwritten five hundred years after Philo\u2019s work\u2014gives a\nmisleading picture of Philonian ethics by not informing us directly of\nthe methods it used to enable and secure the possession of happiness.\nIt is perhaps natural to assume that his methods were the standard\ndogmatic ones. Two aspects of the wider context omitted by the\nexcerptor, however, suggest that Philo\u2019s ethics were in fact\nbased on the Academic method of argument on either side. First, we\nknow that the mitigated skeptics had already come to see their method\nof arguing for and against ethical theses as a way of\nteaching ethics that allowed students to evaluate which views\nwere more persuasive, i.e., had better rational grounds (see\n section 4).\n This is clearest in the case of Philo\u2019s colleague Charmadas in\nCicero On the Orator 1.83\u201393. It is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism from Aenesidemus in Photius\nLibrary 212 170a and Sextus PH 1.226. Secondly, we\nknow that Philo had developed a way to popularize the Academic method\nby incorporating it into a technical system of rhetoric (see Cicero\nOn the Orator 3.110\u2013118 and Tusculan\nDisputations 2.9). But since the function of this system was to\nprovide students with forensic techniques for arguing about moral\nissues, and given that teaching rhetoric in any form was a significant\ndeparture for an Academic philosopher, this development must have had\nsome connection to Philo\u2019s ethical views (see Reinhardt 2000 and\nBrittain 2001).\n\nWhen the summary is read with this wider context in mind, three\napparently minor points stand out. First, the therapeutic stage,\ndealing with the students\u2019 fundamental conceptions of value, is\ndescribed as the effort to replace \u201cfalsely acquired\nbeliefs\u201d with ones \u201cin a healthy state\u201d, rather than\njust false with true beliefs (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7 p.\n40.18\u201320). Secondly, the preservative stage, concerned with the\nlifestyles that promote or secure happiness, is framed as an\ninvestigation of a set of questions that correspond precisely\nwith the questions dealt with by argument on either side in\nPhilo\u2019s rhetoric (ibid. p. 41.7\u201314). And, thirdly, that\nkind of general investigation is explicitly distinguished from the\nprovision of straightforwardly prescriptive advice about how\nto behave, which is regarded as a temporary fix for busy people (ibid.\np. 41.16\u201325). These points can be explained in various ways. But\ngiven the wider context, they suggest that the summary has obscured\nthe central point about Philo\u2019s ethics: its method of teaching\nwas not dogmatic, but the Academic one of argument on either side.\n\nIf this is right, the summary\u2019s apparent ordinariness and\ndogmatic structure reflect only Philo\u2019s systematic approach to\nethical topics, not its methods or results: Philo did not propose a\ndogmatic ethics, but rather a systematic technique for structuring\nstudents\u2019 moral values into a coherent way of life through their\nrational evaluation of arguments on either side. A philosophical\napproach to ethics of this kind allows students to use their ethical\nintuitions\u2014the knowledge provided by their own\nexperience\u2014to revise and structure their conceptions of value,\nand, on that basis, critically evaluate their general social and\npolitical roles, and select the appropriate actions in a particular\nsituation. An approach of this sort perhaps no longer seems striking\nor innovative, but if Philo adopted it in the early 80s BCE, it\npresented no less a challenge to Hellenistic ethics than his Roman\nBooks did to epistemology. Two reasons to think that Philo did adopt\nthis approach are, first, that it yields a conception of ethical\nknowledge that fits the epistemology of the Roman Books\u2014a\nPhilonian rational agent will have the sort of wisdom and happiness\nthat is available to ordinary people, i.e., something quite unlike the\nillusory promise of inerrant knowledge and moral perfection promised\nby the Stoics. And, secondly, Philo\u2019s student Cicero may have\nadopted something like a mitigatedly skeptical version of this\napproach both in his personal life (see Griffin 1989) and in his\nphilosophical works on ethics (see Schofield 2002).\n",
