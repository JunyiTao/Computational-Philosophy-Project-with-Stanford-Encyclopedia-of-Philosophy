    "main_text": "Motivations\n2. Motivations\nLet\u2019s consider, in general terms, what sort of motivations one\nmight have for adopting models that fall under the umbrella of IP. The\nfocus will be on models of rational belief, since these are the models\nthat philosophers typically focus on, although it is worth noting that\nstatistical work using IP isn\u2019t restricted to this\ninterpretation. Note that no one author endorses all of these\narguments, and indeed, some authors who are sympathetic to IP have\nexplicitly stated that they don\u2019t consider certain of these arguments\nto be good (for example Mark Kaplan does not endorse the claim that\nconcerns about descriptive realism suggest allowing\nincompleteness).\n",
