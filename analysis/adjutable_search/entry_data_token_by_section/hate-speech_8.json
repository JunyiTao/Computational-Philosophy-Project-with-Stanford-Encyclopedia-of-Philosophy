    "main_text": "Counteracting Hate Speech || The Case for Bans\n5.1 The Case for Bans\n\nFirst, the case for banning hate speech. While this position may be\nanathema to many (especially in the United States), it is the\nconsensus position of most democratic nations around the globe, as\nwell as the explicit position of the United Nations. In the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article\n20 requires a ban on hate speech\u2014or, in their words, \u201cany\nadvocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes\nincitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be\nprohibited by law\u201d (Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights; see also, Article 4 of Convention on Racial\nDiscrimination). It is worth noting the position of the United\nNations and other democracies on hate speech in part because of the\ncontrast they serve for the dominant position in the United States,\nwhich recognizes some exceptions to the right to free expression\n(e.g., obscenity, libel, child sexual abuse material), but not\ngenerally on the basis of (racial) hate. Moreover, these exhortations\nto criminalize hate speech from the United Nations sit alongside\ncommitments that maintain the importance of freedom of expression. For\ninstance, Article 20, quoted above, is immediately preceded by Article\n19, which affirms right to freedom of expression (Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights).\n\nThe standard justification offered for restrictions on freedom of\nexpression are based on the necessity of (a) respect of the rights or\nreputations of others; and (b) reasons of national security or of\npublic order. In other words, a ban on hate speech may be thought to\nfollow from the recognition of the harms it presents, both to the\ndignity of minority-members of a nation, as well as their physical\nsafety. This position maintains, then, that restrictions on hate\nspeech are a legitimate\u2014and necessary\u2014exception to an\notherwise wider understanding of free expression. (For some theorists,\nit\u2019s worth noting, hate speech is best not understood as the\ntype of speech that free speech protections are meant to\ninclude\u2014e.g., it serves no purpose in the pursuit of\ntruth\u2014and so is not in fact an exception to a free\nspeech principle, but simply not included in a proper understanding of\nthe scope of free speech.) This view naturally follows from the\nunderstanding that multiple values and rights must be balanced against\neach other. This is true both of countries that explicitly prohibit\nhate speech in order to protect minority rights, as well as in more\n\u2018speech-friendly\u2019 nations like the United States, where\nspeech that is aimed at and likely to result in \u201cimminent\nlawless action\u201d may be legitimately restricted (see\nBrandenburg v. Ohio).\n\nHowever, most advocates for legally restricting hate speech believe\nthat its proper scope is wider than what US law currently allows.\nParekh, for example, rejects the position that hate speech may only be\nrestricted when there is \u201cimminent danger\u201d of violence on\nthe grounds that this understanding is too short-sighted. Moreover, he\nsays,\n\nno action occurs in a historical vacuum, and every action produces\nconsequences not inherently but against a particular background.\n\u2026 Imminent danger occurs against, and is imminent because of,\nthe prevailing social climate, and consistency demands that we\nconcentrate our efforts not only on fighting the immediate source of\ndanger, but also on changing the climate. (2012, 45\u201346)\n\n\nOn the understanding that the threat of hate speech is not exhausted\nby cases that concern \u201cimminent danger,\u201d we might then\nground the prohibition of hate speech on the basis that this may\nreduce speech that causes harm to its targets, beyond those most\nimmediately affected. Of course, there is also an important role to be\nplayed by non-legal means (e.g., moral and social pressure) in erasing\nor reducing these harms, so legal bans are best understood as part of\na broader approach to the ills of hate speech. Furthermore, advocates\nof bans describe the expressive dimension of these laws as themselves\nproviding a reason in favor of legislation (Waldron, 2014). The law,\nin this sense, serves as a public statement on a community\u2019s\nvalues, and has educational and symbolic importance in itself (Parekh,\n2012, 46). (For an overview of expressive theories of law, see\nAnderson and Pildes, 2000.) A ban on hate speech, therefore, is\nintended both to reduce harms directly, by decreasing instances of\nhate by the threat of law, as well as indirectly, by shaping the\ncommunity\u2019s moral norms through an expression of value.\n",
