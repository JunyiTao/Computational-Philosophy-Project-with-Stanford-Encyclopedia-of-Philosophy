    "main_text": "Holism and Nonseparability in Classical Physics\n7. Holism and Nonseparability in Classical Physics\n\nClassical physics presents no definitive examples of either\n physical property holism\n or\n nonseparability.\n As section 6 explained, almost any instance of physical property\nholism would demonstrate nonseparability. This justifies restricting\nattention to the latter notion. Now the assumption that all physical\nprocesses are completely described by a local assignment of magnitudes\nforms part of the metaphysical background to classical physics. In\nNewtonian spacetime, the kinematical behavior of a system of point\nparticles under the action of finite forces is supervenient upon\nascriptions of particular values of position and momentum to the\nparticles along their trajectories. This supervenience on local\nmagnitudes extends also to dynamics if the forces on the particles\narise from fields defined at each spacetime point.\n\nThe boiling of a kettle of water is an example of a more complex\nphysical process. It consists in the increased kinetic energy of its\nconstituent molecules permitting each to overcome the short range\nattractive forces which otherwise hold it in the liquid. It thus\nsupervenes on the assignment, at each spacetime point on the\ntrajectory of each molecule, of physical magnitudes to that molecule\n(such as its kinetic energy), as well as to the fields that give rise\nto the attractive force acting on the molecule at that point.\n\nAs an example of a process in Minkowski spacetime (the spacetime\nframework for Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity), consider\nthe propagation of an electromagnetic wave through empty space. This\nis supervenient upon an ascription of the electromagnetic field tensor\nat each point in the spacetime.\n\nBut it does not follow that classical processes like these are\nseparable. For one may question whether an assignment of basic\nmagnitudes at spacetime points amounts to or results from an\nassignment of qualitative intrinsic properties at those points. Take\ninstantaneous velocity, for example: this is usually defined as the\nlimit of average velocities over successively smaller temporal\nneighborhoods of that point. This provides a reason to deny that the\ninstantaneous velocity of a particle at a point supervenes on\nqualitative intrinsic properties assigned at that point. Similar\nskeptical doubts can be raised about the intrinsic character of other\n\u201clocal\u201d magnitudes such as the density of a fluid, the\nvalue of an electromagnetic field, or the metric and curvature of\nspacetime (see Butterfield (2006)).\n\nOne response to such doubts is to admit to a minor consequent\nviolation of separability while introducing a weaker notion,\nnamely\n\nWeak Separability: Any physical process occupying spacetime\nregion R supervenes upon an assignment of\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties at points of R\nand/or in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those\npoints.\n\n\nAlong with a correspondingly strengthened notion of\n\nStrong Nonseparability: Some physical process occupying a\nregion R of spacetime is not supervenient upon an\nassignment of qualitative intrinsic physical properties at points of\nR and/or in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of\nthose points.\n\n\nNo holism need be involved in a process that is nonseparable, but not\nstrongly so, as long as the basic parts of the objects involved in it\nare themselves taken to be associated with arbitrarily small\nneighborhoods rather than points. Versions of Weak\nSeparability are offered by both Belot (1998, p. 540), whose term\nis Synchronic Locality, and by Myrvold (2011, p. 425), who calls it\nPatchy Separability. The idea is that the state of a region supervenes\non assignments of intrinsic properties to patches of the region, where\nthe patches may be taken to be arbitrarily small.\n\nAny physical process fully described by a local spacetime theory will\nbe at least weakly separable. For such a theory proceeds by assigning\ngeometric objects (such as vectors or tensors) at each point in\nspacetime to represent physical fields, and then requiring that these\nsatisfy certain field equations. But processes fully described by\ntheories of other forms will also be separable. These include many\ntheories which assign magnitudes to particles at each point on their\ntrajectories. Of familiar classical theories, it is only theories\ninvolving direct action between spatially separated particles which\ninvolve nonseparability in their description of the dynamical\nhistories of individual particles. But such processes are weakly\nseparable within spacetime regions that are large enough to include\nall sources of forces acting on these particles, so that the\nappearance of strong nonseparability may be attributed to a mistakenly\nnarrow understanding of the spacetime region these processes actually\noccupy.\n\nThe propagation of gravitational energy according to general\nrelativity apparently involves strongly nonseparable processes, since\ngravitational energy cannot be localized (it does not contribute to\nthe stress-energy tensor defined at each point of spacetime as do\nother forms of energy). But even a non-locally-defined gravitational\nenergy will still be supervenient upon the metric tensor defined at\neach point of the spacetime, and so the process of its propagation\nwill be weakly separable.\n\nThe definition of nonseparability becomes problematic in general\nrelativity, since its application requires that one identify the same\nregion R in possible spacetimes with different\ngeometries. But while there is no generally applicable algorithm for\nmaking a uniquely appropriate identification, some identification may\nappear salient in a particular case. For example, one can meaningfully\ndiscuss whether or not the field is the same everywhere in the region\noutside the solenoid in the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect\n with an increased current flowing, even though the size of the\ncurrent will have a (tiny) influence on the geometry of that region.\nNote that the definition of nonseparability does not require that one\nidentify the same point in spacetimes of distinct geometries.\n\nWhile strictly outside the domain of classical physics, quantum\nphenomena such as the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect\n may be considered manifestations of nonseparability and holism even\nin classical electromagnetism. Nonseparability would be a\ntrivial notion if no qualitative intrinsic physical properties were\never assigned at spacetime points or in their neighborhoods. But this\nwould require a thorough-going relationism that took not just\ngeometric but all local features to be irreducibly relational (cf.\nEsfeld (2004)). We will return to this point in our discussion of the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n",
