    "main_text": "Sovereign versus Government\n2. Sovereign versus Government\n\nThough there are serious difficulties inherent in Austin\u2019s\nattempt to make sense of the people\u2019s ultimate sovereignty, his\naccount, with all its weaknesses, does reveal the need to distinguish\nbetween two different concepts: sovereignty and government. Roughly\nspeaking, we might define sovereignty as the possession of\nsupreme (and possibly unlimited) normative power and authority over\nsome domain, and government as those persons or institutions\nthrough whom that sovereignty is exercised. Once some such distinction\nis drawn, we see immediately that sovereignty might lie somewhere\nother than with the government and those who exercise the powers of\ngovernment. And once this implication is accepted, we can coherently\ngo on to speak of limited government coupled with\nunlimited sovereignty. Arguably this is what one should say\nabout constitutional democracies where the people\u2019s sovereign\nauthority is thought to be ultimate and unlimited but the government\nbodies\u2014e.g., legislatures, Presidents and courts\u2014through\nwhom that sovereignty is exercised on the people\u2019s behalf are\nconstitutionally limited and subordinate. As Locke might have said,\nunlimited sovereignty remains with the people who have the normative\npower to void the authority of their government (or some part thereof)\nif it exceeds its constitutional limitations.\n\nThough sovereignty and government are different notions, and normally\napply to different entities, it nevertheless seems conceptually\npossible for them to apply to one and the same individual or\ninstitution. It is arguable that Hobbes insisted on the identification\nof sovereign and government insofar as he seemed to require a\n(virtually) complete transfer of all rights and powers from sovereign\nindividuals to a political sovereign whose authority was to be\nabsolute, thus rendering it possible to emerge from the wretched state\nof nature in which life is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\n short.\u201d[6]\n In Hobbes\u2019 theory, ultimate, unlimited sovereignty must reside\nin the supreme governmental person or body who enjoys unlimited power\nand authority to rule the commonwealth. Anything less than such an\nultimate, unlimited sovereign would, given human nature and the world\nwe inhabit, destroy the potential for stable government and all that\nit makes possible. So even if \u2018sovereignty\u2019 and\n\u2018government\u2019 express different notions, this neither means\nnor implies that the two could not pertain to one and the same\nentity.\n",
