    "main_text": "\n\nIn the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by\nwhich God brings an object into existence, while conservation\nis the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over\ntime. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created\nthe world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether\ncreation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of\nactions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern\ncharacterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed\nattention in recent decades.\n\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous\ncreation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez that God\u2019s creation and conservation of things are\n\u201conly conceptually distinct\u201d (Su\u00e1rez 1597, 120).\nJonathan Edwards, for example, says, \u201cGod\u2019s upholding\ncreated substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment,\nis altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at\neach moment\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the\nfirst creation, but only circumstantially\u2026\u201d (Edwards\n1758, 402). In other words, there is no real difference between the\nact of creation and the act of conservation, though different words\nmay be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley\nall express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats\nboth God\u2019s creating and God\u2019s conserving as species of\nbringing about a thing\u2019s existence. We call the act\n\u2018creation\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the\ncreature exists, and we call it \u2018conservation\u2019 if it\noccurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988,\n54).\n\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that\nalready exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing.\nSome argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its\nongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex\nnihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an\nongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\n\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship\nbetween divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation\ntheorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation\nas an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On\nthe other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous\ncreation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \u201cone of those\nhigh-minded philosophical depreciations of God\u2019s works that come\ndisguised as compliments to God\u2019s person\u201d (van Inwagen\n1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions\nabout causation, time, and their relations.\n",
