    "main_text": "Critiques of Privacy || Thomson\u2019s Reductionism\n2.1 Thomson\u2019s Reductionism\n\nReductionists are named for their view that privacy concerns\nare analyzable or reducible to claims of other sorts, such as\ninfliction of emotional distress or property interests. They deny that\nthere is anything useful in considering privacy as a separate concept.\nReductionists conclude, then, that there is nothing coherent,\ndistinctive or illuminating about privacy interests. Probably the most\nfamous fundamental critique of a right to privacy stems from the work\nof Judith Jarvis Thomson (1975). Having noted that there is little\nagreement on exactly what a right to privacy entails, Thomson examines\na number of cases that have been thought to constitute violations of\nthe right to privacy. On closer inspection, however, Thomson argues\nall those cases can be adequately and equally well-explained in terms\nof violations of property rights or rights over the person, such as a\nright not to be listened to. Ultimately the right to privacy, on\nThomson\u2019s view, is merely a cluster of rights, consisting of\nseveral irreducible \u201cgrand rights\u201d (for instance, the\nright to property), and a number of reducible \u201cungrand\nrights\u201d (such as the right not to be subjected to eavesdropping,\nthe right to keep one\u2019s belongings out of view, and so on). The\n\u201cright over one\u2019s own person\u201d consists of several\nungrand rights, such as (amongst others) the right not to be looked\nat\u2014but is itself not a grand right (Thomson 1975:\n304\u2013306). The different rights in the cluster can be fully\nexplained by, for instance, property rights or rights to bodily\nsecurity. Therefore, the right to privacy, in Thomson\u2019s view, is\n\u201cderivative\u201d in the sense that there is no need to find\nwhat is common in the cluster of privacy rights, and it is also\nderivative in its importance and justification. Any privacy violation\nis better understood as the violation of a more basic right, e.g., the\nright not to be listened to.\n\nThis reductionist view was quickly discarded by Thomas Scanlon, who\nargues in a direct reply to Thomson\u2019s thesis that we have, for\ninstance, a general right not to be looked at that\n\n\n[a]s far as I can see I have no such general rights to begin with. I\nhave an interest not to be looked at when I wish not to be\n(\u2026). But rights directly corresponding to these interests would\nbe too broad to be part of a workable system. (1975: 320)\n\n\nThe right to privacy is grounded in \u201cthe special interests that\nwe have in being able to be free from certain kinds of\nintrusions\u201d (Scanlon 1975: 315). Scanlon\u2019s reply to\nThomson can be read as an attempt to find a common ground for\ndifferent aspects of privacy (DeCew 1997; Rachels 1975; Reiman 1976;\nGavison 1980; see also\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74).\n\nRaymond Geuss (2001), on the other hand, seconds Thomson\u2019s\nreductionist line of criticism but adds to it a more fundamental\nconsideration:\n\n\nJudith Jarvis Thomson has argued very persuasively that this right\ndoes not exist in the sense that it fails to designate any kind of\ncoherent single property or single interest. That does not mean that\nnone of the various things that have come to be grouped under\n\u201cprivacy\u201d are goods\u2014far from it, many of them are\nextremely important and valuable\u2014only that they are disparate\ngoods, and the perfectly adequate grounds we have for trying to\npromote them have little to do with one another. (2001: 145)\n\n\nThe very distinction between private and public, he argues, already\nrelies on the assumption that there exists a unified liberal\ndistinction that is set in stone politically, and uncontested. But\nthis assumption displays not only a mistaken conception of the\ndistinction between public and private, but also a mistaken conception\nof politics. In \u201creal politics\u201d, all distinctions and\nvalues are contested. As a result, the liberal distinction is illusory\nand ideological. According to Geuss, this becomes apparent only when\none recognizes the deep heterogeneity of privacy, its reducibility to\nother interests, and the plurality of very different values attached\nto its various meanings (Geuss 2001).\n",
