    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge\n2. Theory of Knowledge\n\nFor us, epistemology has become a matter of good conscience, and\nwe will not be prepared to listen to anyone who fails to justify his\nideas on this basis.\n(Rickert 1986, 21)\n\n\nFor Rickert epistemology or Erkenntnistheorie\n(\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019) has to be the point of departure\nand the systematic foundation of philosophy as a whole. He often uses\ninterchangeably the words \u201clogic\u201d (Logik),\n\u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d (Erkenntnistheorie),\n\u201cmethodology\u201d (Methodologie), \u201ctheory of\ntruth\u201d (Wahrheitslehre) and \u201ctheory of\nscience\u201d (Wissenschaftslehre). (See for instance Rickert\n1986, 19; Rickert 1909, 170.) This is because ultimately all these\nphrases refer to one and the same problem, i.e., the problem of the\nvalidity of thought and the principles on which valid thought rests.\nErkenntnistheorie, therefore, is his preferred phrase because\nit makes this fundamental problem most explicit.\n\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of knowledge is designed to answer the\nfollowing question: \u201cwhat is the subject-independent yardstick of\nknowledge? In other words, through what does knowledge receive its\nobjectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 1) Or, following the title of his\nmajor work in the theory of knowledge, what is the object of knowledge?\nIn asking this question Rickert is explicitly setting up a\ntranscendental argument that can be summarized as follow: given that\n(1) there is knowledge and that (2) knowledge as true\nthought can be contrasted to mere thought in that it grasps some\nthought-independent object, how are we to think this\nthought-independent object? (Rickert 1909, 170) Therefore Rickert\nrejects the idea that the theory of knowledge should somehow respond to\nskepticism (Rickert 1921a, 7; Rickert 1909, 174). To the extent that\nskepticism negates the very possibility of knowledge it cannot be\nmeaningfully addressed in a theory that sets out to determine precisely\nwhat knowledge is. Nonetheless Rickert believes that a modified version\nof skeptical doubt, which he compares to Husserl\u2019s\nepoch\u00e9 (Rickert 1921a, 12), is beneficial to the theory\nof knowledge. The theory of knowledge cannot begin without some\npresuppositions, in particular, that there are true thoughts in which a\nsubject successfully grasps an object. \u201cHowever, the theory of\nknowledge ought to be \u2018presuppositionless\u2019 in the sense\nthat it ought to limit as much as possible the presuppositions upon\nwhich the objectivity of knowledge rests\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 12).\nIt is through the exercise of doubt that we get to raise the key\nquestion as to whether we necessarily have to posit a transcendent\nreality existing independently of consciousness as the source\nof validation for knowledge. The pursuit of the object of knowledge,\nthen, leads straight to the problem of transcendence and its\nrelation to the knowing subject. Note that Rickert is not questioning\none of the inescapable assumptions of any theory of knowledge, namely,\nthat there has to be some subject-independent yardstick or criterion\nthat validates knowledge. He is questioning whether this\nsubject-independent criterion has to be understood as a transcendent\nreality, for instance, a world of mind-independent and\npresumably physical things in themselves. His conclusion will be\nprecisely that this transcendent criterion cannot be meaningfully\nconceived of as a reality and that only values can be\nconsidered genuinely transcendent.\n\n\nRickert argues that we can tackle the problem of the theory of\nknowledge in two ways: \u201cOne can begin first with an analysis of\nthe real act of knowledge as a psychic process and then, from there,\nmove progressively to determine the transcendent object. Secondly, one\ncan attempt to reach as quickly as possible the sphere of the\ntranscendent object and deal with it in a purely \u2018logical\u2019\nfashion without considering the psychic act of knowing\u201d (Rickert\n1909, 174). He labels these two approaches the\n\u201ctranscendental-psychological\u201d (or subjective) and the\n\u201ctranscendental-logical\u201d (or objective) ways (Rickert 1909, \n174). While in the first editions of The Object of Knowledge\nRickert privileged the transcendental-psychological way, in the early\n1900s he introduced the transcendental-logical way and incorporated it\ninto later editions of the book, arguing that the two ways should be\nconsidered complementary.\n\n\nThe most important move at the beginning of the subjective way is to\ndetermine the notions of subject and object that the theory of\nknowledge can legitimately operate with, and, in particular to\ncharacterize \u201cthe epistemological subject\u201d (das\nerkenntnistheoretische Subjekt) (Rickert 1921a, 41). Rickert\nexamines three different subject/object dichotomies. (1) We can define\nthe object in spatial terms as what is out there in the world. This is\nwhat the expression \u2018external world\u2019 seems to refer to.\nCorrespondingly, the subject, too, will be defined in spatial terms as\nthe animated body, for which there are spatial surroundings populated\nby objects. The first dichotomy construes subject and object as\n\u201ctwo bodies\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 14) facing each other in\nphysical space. (2) We can construe a second dichotomy, in which we\ntake our body, too, to be an object like other objects and consider\n\u2018subject\u2019 to refer exclusively to consciousness. \u201cIn\nthis second case my consciousness and its content are the subject, and\ntherefore the object is everything that is not my content of\nconsciousness or my consciousness itself\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 15).\nThis second dichotomy captures the traditional distinction between\nimmanence and transcendence. (3) A third dichotomy ensues from a\nfurther distinction that we can carry out within the sphere of\nimmanence, that is, the distinction between the ego and its\nrepresentations, or between any content of consciousness and\nconsciousness itself. In this third case representations, perceptions,\nfeelings, emotions etc. would be the object and the subject would be\nthe ego standing over against them.\n\n\nBased on these dichotomies, it seems that the problem of\ntranscendence and its possible denial only pertains to (2). It would\nnot make sense to question the transcendence of the object if by object\nwe mean what occupies the spatial surroundings of a psychophysical\nhuman subject and, similarly, it would not make sense to deny the\ntranscendence of our representations, perceptions, emotions etc. from\nthe point of view of the pure ego-subject undergoing such\nrepresentations, perceptions, emotions, etc. Following the subjective\nway, we should then set out to determine whether we necessarily have to\nposit the existence of transcendent objects independent from the\ncontents of our consciousness. We should, it seems, assume what the\npositivists have called \u201cthe standpoint of immanence\u201d\n(Rickert 1921a, 21) and see if there is some rationally justifiable way\nto infer our way out of it.\n\n\nThis conception however, is misleading and if we took it as our\npoint of departure it would put the whole enterprise of the theory of\nknowledge in jeopardy. Who or what is the subject, for which the\nproblem of transcendence can be meaningfully posed? Rickert indicates\nthat the three concepts of subject considered above ought to be seen in\ntheir mutual relations. If we begin with the psychophysical subject in\n(1), we can obtain the notion of subject in (2) by way of a progressive\n\u2018objectification\u2019 of the body (Rickert 1921a, 35). I can\nprogressively consider each part of my body as itself an\n\u2018object\u2019 or content of my consciousness and once the whole\nbody has been \u2018purged out\u2019 the result will be a purely\npsychic subject, which Rickert defines as \u201cthe limit concept\n(Grenzbegriff) of the series, in which the physical component\nin the subject becomes progressively smaller\u201d (Rickert 1921a,\n36). In a similar way, we can continue the process of\n\u2018de-objectification\u2019 of the subject and consider each and\nevery mental state as itself an object for an absolutely non-objective\nand non-objectifiable ego. In this way we reach the authentic\nepistemological subject, the identical\n\u201csubject-factor\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 42) that provides the form\n\u2018subjectivity\u2019 to every possible content of consciousness.\nFollowing Kant\u2019s terminology Rickert designates the\nepistemological subject \u201cconsciousness in general\u201d, that is,\na \u201cnameless, generic, impersonal consciousness\u201d (Rickert\n1921a, 42). This consciousness in general has to be distinguished\nsharply not only from the individual psychophysical human subject but\nalso from the individual psychic subject with its empirical mental\nstates.\n\n\nRickert insists: \u201cThe question regarding immanence or\ntranscendence only makes epistemological sense with respect to the\nepistemological subject or consciousness in general\u201d (Rickert\n1921a, 43). From this perspective, \u201cto be immanent means nothing\nbut to carry the form of being-conscious (Bewu\u00dftheit)\nand to be transcendent means to really exist without such form\u201d\n(Rickert 1921a, 48). Given these definitions, Rickert contends that\nwhile there are many good reasons to reject psychological idealism, if\none holds fast to consciousness in general there is no good reason to\nposit the existence of a transcendent reality beyond the\nsphere encompassed by the epistemological subject. His theory of\nknowledge is therefore committed to transcendental idealism. In order\nto defend this point Rickert examines three types of arguments that\nhave been traditionally played out against transcendental idealism as\ndefenses of the necessity to posit a transcendent reality: (1)\ntranscendence as the unexperienced cause of conscious experiences\n(Rickert 1921a, 62\u201373); (2) transcendence as necessary in order to fill\nthe gaps in our conscious experiences (Rickert 1921a, 74\u201384); (3)\ntranscendence as the objective counterpart of our will, that is, as the\ncorrelate of the experience of a resistance and constraint to our\nwillful actions (Rickert 1921a, 84\u201393). All these arguments, however,\nonly show that we cannot reduce reality to psychic existence. In other\nwords, they are good arguments only against a psychological idealism\n\u00e0 la Berkeley according to which reality would\ncoincide with our empirical mental states. From the point of view of\nthe epistemological subject, however, both psychic and physical\noccurrences are objects whose reality is encompassed by the form\n\u2018consciousness in general\u2019. A transcendental\nidealist, then, emphatically agrees that there is an extra-mental\nphysical reality causing the occurrence of mental states in empirical\nsubjects. To the extent that they are experienced or experienceable,\nhowever, both extra-mental (physical things) and intra-mental realities\n(mental states) have to be seen as content of consciousness,\nnamely, of transcendental consciousness in general. It is important to\nremember that by \u2018consciousness in general\u2019 Rickert means\nno individual psychic subject but the general form of subjective\naccessibility. In other words, to say that all reality is a content of\nconsciousness does not mean that all reality is psychic. It means that\nall reality (both psychic and physical) is encompassed by a general\nform of subjectivity, which makes it available for theoretical\ndetermination. Commenting on his own brand of transcendental idealism,\nRickert states: \u201cour standpoint is the true realism\u201d\n(Rickert 1921a, 104), in that it refuses to counterpose an immanent\npsychic reality to an inaccessible transcendent reality to be posited\nvia inferential reasoning. Rickert insists that transcendental idealism\nconsiders real precisely the reality that we encounter in everyday life\nthrough sensory experience, consisting of immediately aware psychic and\nphysical occurrences. What it rejects is that this reality can be\nmeaningfully construed as transcendent vis-\u00e0-vis\nconsciousness in general.\n\n\nThe reason why one might be prone to reject transcendental idealism\nis a wrong conception of what knowledge really is all about. Rickert\nlabels this conception the copy-theory or pictorial theory\n(Abbildtheorie) of knowledge. According to this conception,\n\u201cthe act of knowing has to depict (abbilden) a reality\nindependent from its activity of representing\n(vorstellen)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 119). The rejection of a\npictorial theory of cognition and the ensuing intuitionism (according\nto which to know is merely to intuit some mind-independent real or\nnoetic object), remains a constant in Rickert\u2019s philosophy (see\nRickert 1934a; Staiti 2013a). It also connects Rickert with other\nNeo-Kantians, including Natorp and Cassirer in Marburg, who likewise\nreject the notion that knowledge is a merely picturing representation\nof the object (see Holzey 2010; Kubalica 2013).\n\n\nIn order to expose the untenable notions in the pictorial theory of\nknowledge Rickert introduces a distinction between the form\nand the content of cognition. While nothing is wrong with the\nidea that in order to have knowledge we have to take up in some\nrepresentations some content, what distinguishes knowledge from other\nkinds of representation must be sought in its form. If I say\nof a piece of paper that it is white, then certainly \u201cmy\nrepresentation reproduces what is real with respect to the white, and\nthis is why the statement is true\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125). However,\nthis is not all. \u201cIn the statement at issue (this piece of paper\nis white), in fact, not only is the being-white asserted\nalongside the being-white, but rather, the white as\n\u2018property\u2019 is also attributed to a \u2018thing\u2019,\nand, in so being, the being-white is determined more specifically.\nThing and property, however, are, as much as being and reality,\nconcepts that do not belong in the content of knowledge. One has to\nknow beforehand what it means epistemologically that a\n\u2018thing\u2019 has a \u2018property\u2019 and what the\nobjectivity of this piece of knowledge rests upon in order to be able\nto say: \u2018the thought: this piece of paper is white grasps what is\nreal through pictorial representations\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 125\u2013126;\nRickert 1909, 177). The theorist of knowledge cannot overlook the gulf\nthat exists between the pre-discursive perceptual experience of seeing\na white piece of paper and the articulation of the true judgment\n\u2018this piece of paper is white\u2019. The judgment does not\nmerely mirror or depict perceptual reality. Rather, the judgment\ntransforms and reshapes the perceptual material delivered by the senses\nby way casting it into a new form, whose legitimacy does not rest in\nthe faithful depiction of the perceptual scene but in the logical\nvalidity of such forms. The problem of the pictorial theory of\ncognition is that it \u201cignores the form\u201d (Rickert 1909,\n178).\n\n\nThese considerations lead to one of the key theses in\nRickert\u2019s theory of knowledge: \u201cThe fundamental problem of\nthe theory of knowledge is the question regarding the yardstick or the\nobject of judging (Rickert 1921a, 131\u2013132). The\nepistemological subject is not merely a representational subject, but\nrather a judging subject. Judgment is for Rickert the place where the\nstandpoint of immanence is necessarily broken and the genuine meaning\nof transcendence becomes manifest. In his analysis of judgment Rickert\ndraws a sharp distinction between the psychological act of judging and\nthe content (Gehalt) of a judgment, which parallels\nHusserl\u2019s treatment of the same issue in Logical\nInvestigations (Husserl 1973). While the act of judging, say, that\n2 + 2 = 4 is a psychic occurrence unfolding in time and differing for\neach empirical subject making this judgment, the objective content\ngrasped by this act, the true relation 2 + 2 = 4 is timelessly\nvalid and it is one over and against the many psychic acts\ndirected towards it. Moreover, if by real we mean either a psychic or a\nphysical entity, then the content of the judgment 2 + 2 = 4 has to be\ndeemed \u201cunreal\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 145). Taking notice of the\nobjective content of an act and reflecting back on the psychological\nact of judging that intends such content we also have to highlight a\nthird component of a judgment, which Rickert labels\n\u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the act (Rickert 1921a, 145), i.e. that\nwhich orients the act towards the judged content. As one commentator\nputs it: \u201cthe immanent sense of the judgment stands in an\nintermediate position between the real psychic act and the unreal\nlogical content\u201d (Oliva 2006, 97). It is the function\n(Leistung) performed by the psychic act seen purely and\nexclusively in its functionality of connecting psychological\nsubjectivity and logical objectivity. Determining what kind of immanent\nfunction characterizes judgments and how this function sets them apart\nfrom other kinds of psychic occurrences is Rickert\u2019s next\nstep.\n\n\nIn order to grasp the epistemological essence of judgment and its\nrelation to the fundamental epistemological problem of transcendence we\nhave to describe its difference from a mere representation or string of\nrepresentations. The best way to characterize the specific essence of\njudgment is by \u201cconsidering the judgment the answer to a\nquestion\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 153). Rickert thus identifies the\nessence of judgment is thus in the function of \u201caffirmation or\nnegation\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 154), thereby following a trend in\nlogic that dates back to Brentano (see Brentano 1995, 194\u2013234). If we\nconsider exclusively the representational content, the judgment,\n\u201cthis paper is white\u201d, and the question, \u201cis this\npaper white?\u201d do not differ in the slightest. The same\nrepresentational elements are there in a meaningful connection. The\ngenuine performance of judgment, for Rickert, is all contained in the\n\u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 that we could answer to the\nquestion, thereby taking a stance with regards to the represented\ncontent. In fact, what distinguishes judgment from all sorts of\nrepresentations is the moment of \u2018stance-taking\u2019\n(Stellungnehmen) expressed by the words \u2018yes\u2019 or\n\u2018no\u2019. Judging should then be considered a \u201cpractical\ncomportment (Verhalten)\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165), in which\nsomething is acknowledged as true or rejected as\nfalse. In this regard, judging has to be considered an \u201cact of\nvaluing\u201d (Rickert 1921a, 165). What is it, however,\nthat elicits from the epistemological subject an act of stance-taking?\nRickert explains: \u201cWith our act of affirming we can only orient\nourselves toward requirements (Forderungen), only\nvis-\u00e0-vis a requirement can we comport ourselves in an endorsing\nfashion. In this way we have obtained the broadest concept for the\nobject of knowledge. What is known, that is, what is affirmed or\nacknowledged in the act of judgment must be located in the sphere of\nthe \u2018ought\u2019 (Sollen)\u201d (Rickert 1909, 184).\nThis is the kind of transcendence that Rickert set out to determine at\nthe beginning. The object of knowledge has to be conceived as\ntranscendent, however, not as a transcendent reality mirrored\nby a psychological act of representation but as a \u201ctranscendent\nought\u201d (Rickert 1909, 187). This prompts the\ntheoretically oriented subject to affirm the transcendent\ntheoretical value of truth in the necessary connection existing\nbetween the form and the content expressed in a true judgment.\n\n\nExamining retrospectively the results of this first subjective path\nof the theory of knowledge Rickert points out a number of shortcomings.\nIt seems that if we begin with an analysis of the act of judging, we\ncan only reach the transcendent object of knowledge by way of a\n\u201cpetitio principii\u201d (Rickert 1909, 190). If we\ntake our cues from the psychologically perceived \u201cfeeling of a\nrequirement\u201d (Forderungsgef\u00fchl) and from the\nevidence of the judged content as the \u201cimmanent indicator of the\ntranscendent\u201d (Rickert 1909, 189), we have no sufficient reason\nto posit a transcendent object of knowledge unless we somehow already\npresupposed it in the very analysis of this feeling and its\npsychological connotations. It seems that the only conclusion we could\nlegitimately draw without falling into circular reasoning is that when\na certain compelling feeling of evidence occurs, we feel the urge to\naffirm the truth of a certain connection between a form and a content.\nBut this does not really amount to proving that the internally felt\nsense of ought is connected to a transcendent ought. Rickert considers\npetitio principii inherent in the subjective path to be\nproblematic but nonetheless a useful starting point, in that it allows\nus to analyze the meaning of certain fundamental concepts of the theory\nof knowledge such as transcendence, ought, stance-taking and\nrecognition. However, in order to have a complete theory of knowledge,\nan objective or transcendental-logical path has to be taken.\n\n\nActs of judgments are not the only kinds of realities to which truth\nor falsehood attach. Propositions can also be true or false and their\nmeanings can be taken as a new point of departure for the sake of\ndetermining the transcendent object of knowledge avoiding a petitio\nprincipii (Rickert 1909, 197). The meaning of a proposition can be\ntaken objectively and independently of empirical acts of thought. In\nthis case, we can say of the proposition itself that is either true or\nfalse, without thereby referring to the feeling of evidence or\nnecessity perceived by the subject of judgment. In propositional logic\nwe are accustomed to assign a truth-value to a given\nproposition and in so doing we think of the truth-value as pertaining\nto the proposition itself and not to the immanent psychological act\nthat affirms the proposition\u2019s truth. This is the advantage of\nthe objective path over the subjective path: \u201cThe subjective path\nled us to the object as a requirement (Forderung) and this\nrequirement was then interpreted as a transcendent ought. The objective\npath leads us directly to a transcendent value, and this concept yields\nthe form of the object in its purity for the first time. Value and\nought do not coincide. The ought is not the pure value. It represents\nthe unreal as a command and relates it to a subject from which it\ndemands obedience, recognition and submission. This is a secondary and\neven misleading addition. Only the value which rests upon itself and\nholds valid as value [\u2026] is the transcendent object\u201d\n(Rickert 1921a, 242).\n\n\nRickert considers the concept of transcendent value (as pure\nvalidity independent of subjective acts of valuing) the culmination of\nhis theory of knowledge. It is ultimately the theoretical value of\ntruth, the unreal transcendent object, that is\n\u2018known\u2019 or grasped in every act of true judgment. However,\nthis does not imply a complete rejection or neglect of the valuing\nsubjectivity. Rickert maintains that once the theory of knowledge has\nestablished the absolute transcendence of values and their independence\nfrom empirical acts of valuing, it is then possible to relate values\nback to subjectivity. As we know, the immanent sense of acts\n(Aktsinn) is the unreal component of acts that mediates\nbetween the empirical sphere of psyche and the unreal sphere of values.\nSubjectivity is then interpreted as the \u2018middle\u2019 factor\ncapable of mediating between reality and value, and thereby it receives\nits philosophical \u2018dignification\u2019. It is fair to say that\nRickert\u2019s work in all other fields of philosophy and in\nparticular in the theory of the empirical sciences is an attempt to\nreconstruct the meaning of various spheres of reality and knowledge\nfrom his fundamental insight into the transcendence of values.\nSee also the\n\nSupplement on Rickert\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics\n\n",
