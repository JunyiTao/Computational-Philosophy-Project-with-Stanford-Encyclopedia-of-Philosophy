    "main_text": "Non-Classical Interpretations\n3. Non-Classical Interpretations\n\nClassical propositional logic is evidently a valuable framework not\nonly for organizing principles of reasoning but for providing a fairly\nsimple setting for showcasing basic theoretical phenomena such as\ncompleteness, formal consistency, axiomatic independence, and the\nlike. But a considerable measure of the value of its systematic\ndevelopment lies in the indications, along the way, of ways to deviate\nfrom the classical framework and devise alternative interpretations of\nthe propositional connectives. We have touched on a few indications\nalready: the independence of the principle of excluded middle from the\nother axioms in Frege\u2019s formal deduction system, the\nimplausibility of the material conditional as an analysis of the truth\nconditions of ordinary indicative mood \u201cif \u2026then\u201d\nstatements, etc. Here we survey some of the most prevalent alternative\nsystems of propositional logic.\n",
