Rather than saying that possible worlds exist\nbecause they are quantified over in the best paraphrase of our\ntheories, Lewis says they exist because they are quantified over in\njust one\n paraphrase\n of our theories. To be sure, he says this is a permissible\nparaphrase. On the other hand, there is vanishingly little defence of\nits permissibility.\n\nIn the first chapter of Plurality Lewis takes a much more\northodox Quinean line. He argues, at great length, that the best\nversion of many philosophical theories requires quantification over\npossibilities. In traditional terms, he offers an extended\n indispensability argument\n for unactualised possibilities. But traditional terms are perhaps\nmisleading here. Lewis does not say that possibilities are absolutely\nindispensable, only that they make our philosophical theories so much\nbetter that we have sufficient reason to accept them.\n\nThere are four areas in which Lewis thinks that possible worlds earn\ntheir keep.\n\nModality: Traditional treatments of modal talk in\nterms of operators face several difficulties. They can\u2019t, at\nleast without significant cost, properly analyse talk about contingent\nexistence, or talk about modal comparatives, or modal supervenience\ntheses. All of these are easy to understand in terms of quantification\nacross possibilities.\nCloseness: Our best theory of counterfactuals,\nLewis\u2019s theory, relies on comparisons between possible worlds.\nIndeed, it relies on comparisons between this world and other worlds.\nSuch talk will be hard to paraphrase away if worlds aren\u2019t\nreal.\nContent: Lewis argues, in part following\nStalnaker (1984), that our best theory of mental and verbal content\nanalyses content in terms of sets of possibilities. This, in turn,\nrequires that the possibilities exist.\nProperties: We often appear to quantify over\nproperties. The modal realist can take properties to be sets of\npossibilia, and take such quantification at face value. In his\ndiscussion of properties here, Lewis expands upon his theory of\nnatural properties that he introduced in \u201cNew Work for a Theory\nof Universals\u201d, and that we discussed in section 3.\n\n\nAfter arguing that we are best off in all these areas of philosophy if\nwe accept unactualised possibilities, Lewis spends the rest of chapter\n1 saying what possible worlds are on his view. He isn\u2019t yet\narguing for this way of thinking about possible worlds; that will come\nin chapter 3. For now he is just describing what he takes to be the\nbest theory of possible worlds. He holds that possible worlds are\nisolated; no part of one is spatio-temporally related to any other\nworld. Indeed, he holds that lack of spatio-temporal relation (or\nsomething like it) is what marks individuals as being in different\nworlds. So his theory has the somewhat odd consequence that there\ncould not have been two parts of the world that aren\u2019t\nspatio-temporally connected. He holds that worlds are concrete, though\nspelling out just what the abstract/concrete distinction comes to in\nthis context isn\u2019t a trivial task. And he holds that worlds are\nplenitudinous, there are enough of them to do the work needed for an\nanalysis of modality. This requires at least that they satisfy a\nprinciple of recombination. But since it is possible that things are\ndifferent in kind to anything that actually exists, plenitude implies\nthat there are worlds that can\u2019t be made by simply putting parts\nof this world together. (Alastair Wilson (forthcoming) has a good survey of\nthe complicated relationship between plenitude and recombination.)\n",
