    "main_text": "Historical background\n1. Historical background\n\nConflicts between reductionist views and their dualist and pluralist\nmetaphysical rivals have loomed large in the history of philosophy.\nThe classical debate between materialism and mind-body dualism is\nsimply the most familiar of many such disputes. The Cartesian dualist\nis committed to distinct types of substances\u2014minds and bodies\neach with its own essence. Different versions of\ndualism\u2014interactive, epiphenomenal, parallelist \u2013 disagree\nabout whether the two causally interact, but they all assert the\nontological difference between the mind and body. Neither reduces to\nthe other. They are distinct, and both are real.\n\nMost contemporary reductionist as well as eliminativist positions\ninclude some commitment to materialism or\nphysicalism\u2014the view that the physical or material\nprovides the fundamental reductive base. However reductionism per\nse is ontologically neutral. The concept of reduction entails no\nspecific ontological positions. It is logically independent of\nphysicalism or materialism. Indeed reductionism could be true of the\nentities in a totally nonphysical world as long as it had some base\nand everything in that world reduced to that base. Reduction is a\ngeneral relation between entities or theories that might hold in many\nsorts of specific cases.\n\nSome historical reductivists have been resolutely opposed to\nmaterialism and physicalism. Bishop Berkeley\u2019s phenomenal\nidealism reduced ordinary tables and chairs to collections of ideas\nand denied the existence of matter. On Berkeley\u2019s reductive view\neverything real reduces to minds and ideas. Idealism, as proposed by\nFichte can also be given a reductive interpretation. On this view, the\nnon-mental does not exist over and above the mental. The non-mental\ncan be fully explained in terms of the mental, and it can be\nultimately assimilated to the mental. According to this\ninterpretation, everything just is ultimately mental.\nIdealists are reductionists whose reductive base is mental.\n\nIdealism does not have many contemporary supporters, but there are\ncurrent reductive theories that are logically independent of\nphysicalism though consistent with it. Nominalism, for example, can be\nregarded as a reductive theory about kinds. The nominalist argues that\nthe supposed reality of abstract objects\u2014whether properties and\nkinds or numbers and sets\u2014can be reduced to facts about concrete\nobjects and our ways of talking about them. French structuralists can\nbe seen as reductionists about subjects, or subjectivism; they suggest\nthat the functioning of individual intentions and goals reduces to the\ninner workings of larger discourses.\n\nCarnap\u2019s mid-20th century unificationism presents an interesting\nexample of ontologically neutral, phenomenological reductionism.\nCarnap\u2019s reductionism states that:\n\n\n\u2026 science is a unity, [such] that all empirical statements can\nbe expressed in a single language, all states of affairs are of one\nkind and are known by the same method. (Carnap 1934: 32)\n\n\nThis interpretation covers several aspects\u2014semantic ones\n(concerning the expressive power of a language), metaphysical ones\n(states of affairs being of one kind), and methodological\nones. Assume that any empirical statement, or proposition, can be\nexpressed in a single language. This language is, on Carnap\u2019s\nview, a language that employs observational concepts only. This seems\nto amount to an ontologically neutral form of reductionism. In\nprinciple, any reductionist\u2014the idealist as well as the\nmaterialist\u2014can subscribe to this thesis. Disagreement will\nstart only when it comes to specifying the ontological status of the\nkinds designated by this language\u2019s observational expressions.\nAre they external mind independent properties of objects or are they\nphenomenal properties directly present in perceptual experience?\n\nIn sum, though most contemporary reductionists are also physicalists,\nthere are many actual reductionist positions that are independent of\nmaterialism and physicalism. Such positions have played an important\nrole in the history of philosophy, and some are actively supported\ntoday even as forms of scientific reduction.\n\nThe notion of reduction itself has become a target of philosophical\ninvestigation. If science is to provide (at least partial) answers to\nquestions of reduction, such as whether the mental reduces to the\nneural, then we need to understand what reduction requires. What are\nthe necessary conditions and how might scientific evidence show\nwhether they are fulfilled?\n\nJ.J.C. Smart provided an influential, tentative description of the\nreduction relation according to which an entity x reduces to an\nentity y only if x does not exist \u2018over and\nabove\u2019 y (Smart 1959: 143). Smart frames the question as\none of existence, an ontological question: What really\nexists? How many basic kinds of things exist? Approaching the issue\nfrom a different slant, the philosophical notion of\n\u2018reduction\u2019 might be cashed out in terms of an\nexplanatory relation. If x reduces to y, then\nit can in a relevantly strong sense be explained in terms of y.\nTake an example from Ernest Nagel. Describing the possible reduction\nof headaches, he writes that when\n\n\nthe detailed physical, chemical, and physiological conditions for the\noccurrence of headaches are ascertained \u2026 an explanation will\nhave been found for the occurrence of headaches (Nagel 1961: 366)\n\n\nAlternatively, reductions can be conceived of as consisting in a\nspecific form of assimilation\u2014a description that can\nalso be found in Nagel (1961): \n\n\n[In a reduction, a] set of distinctive traits of some subject matter\nis assimilated to what is patently a set of quite dissimilar traits.\n(Nagel 1961: 339f.)\n\n\nReductivists are generally realists about the reduced phenomena and\ntheir views are in that respect conservative. They are\ncommitted to the reality of the reducing base and thus to the reality\nof whatever reduces to that base. If thoughts reduce to brain states\nand brain states are real, then so too are thoughts. Though\nconservative realism is the norm, some reductionists take a more\nanti-realist view. In such cases the reducing phenomena are taken to\nreplace the prior phenomena which are in turn eliminated. The\nidea of mental illness as a type of psycho-neural disorder replaces\nthe idea of demon possession. Demons and their voices have no role or\nreality in the new theory. The oxygen theory of combustion replaced\nthe phlogiston theory and phlogiston was eliminated.\n\nWhether to count such eliminativist views as a variety of\nreduction is a matter of theoretical choice. Some might argue\nreduction entails realism about the reduced phenomena. If so,\nelimination is not reduction. On the other hand, replacement has\nsometimes been classed as a form of reduction (Kemeny & Oppenheim\n1956), and it corresponds to an everyday sense in which theories are\ndescribed as \u2018reductive\u2019. There is clearly a reductive\naspect to the eliminativist\u2019s claim that nothing is real other\nthan the replacing phenomena, e.g., that there is nothing real other\nthan brain states. Nonetheless most reductive views are realist, so\n\u2018reduction\u2019 hereafter should be understood in the\nconservative sense that entails the realism of the reduced phenomena\nunless otherwise noted.\n\nAttempts to characterize the reduction-relation go back to the early\nyears of logical empiricism. Neurath (1931) and Carnap (1934)\ndescribed reduction as a relation of translation, or at least of\nunification by the universal requirement that all statements have\ntestable consequences that can be stated in a shared observation\nlanguage.\n\nIn more recent decades two closely related strands of debate have\nfocused on the nature of reduction, one within the philosophy of\nscience and the other within the philosophy of mind. Philosophers of\nscience have proposed several explications of the notion of reduction,\noften with an eye on broader conceptions of explanation, scientific\nchange, and unification. Philosophers of mind concerned with specific\nquestions about whether the mental just is physiological or\neven physical in nature have asked what notions of reduction might be\nrelevant and how they might apply to particular cases in psychology\nand neuroscience. The former philosophy of science strand is the topic\nof\n section 2,\n and the philosophy of mind debate is discussed in\n section 3.\n",
