    "main_text": "Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing\n2. Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing\n\nFeminist philosophical models of arguing aim either to replace or to\ncomplement arguing practices and norms defined in terms of a contest\nbetween people or reasons. In addition to the goal of defeating an\ninterlocutor or their reasons, arguments can serve many purposes.\nExplanation and explanatory argument (sometimes considered to be the\nsame thing) already receive attention from argumentation theorists and\nphilosophers of science. Other functions of arguing, such as educating\nthe uninitiated or the undecided and discussing matters with\nlike-minded people, remain neglected by theorists (Goodwin &\nInnocenti 2019). None of the alternatives need to take over as a new\n\u201cparadigm\u201d, but exploring various purposes, methods, and\nstyles of arguing may help to scrutinize accepted procedures and\npurposes (Moulton 1983). Such questioning of methods deters their\ndogmatic acceptance.\n\nAccording to Cohen, more important for the role of arguing in\nphilosophy and education than to praise or condemn any particular\nnorms of arguing may be the exploration of multiple approaches.\nPhilosophers and arguers more generally might find means for\ninnovation and constructive questioning in many new models and\nmetaphors. Cohen finds that traffic metaphors seem to work especially\nwell:\n\n\nWe can say that arguments are (i) conversational traffic\njams\u2014(ii) gridlock with a lot of honking and little movement;\n(iii) conversational traffic accidents; (iv) wrong turns, or (v)\ndetours, or (vi) dead ends or (vii) roundabouts on the streets of\ndiscourse; or should we have said that they are (viii) short cuts to\nthe truth at the end of the road; maybe (ix) they are long and winding\nroads to nowhere; or, instead, we can conceive of arguments as (x)\nintellectual one way roads to their conclusions although maybe they\nare really (xi) one-lane roads but with two-way traffic. More\npositively, they can be thought of as a case of (xii) a merging\ntraffic of ideas or even better as (xiii) conceptual roads under\nconstruction. (Cohen 1995: 184)\n\n\nThe availability of so many traffic metaphors suggests something\nappropriate about this analogy. Another option identified by Keith\nLloyd (2014) lies in perceptual metaphors, especially regarding what\narguers can see. However, visual metaphors have a fraught history in\nfeminist philosophy because ideal vision tends to be associated with\nabstraction, and to lean on a hierarchy of the senses (Keller &\nGrontkowski 1983). In any case it is likely that no metaphor or\nanalogy can capture all the shapes that arguments take and the\npurposes they serve (Cohen 1995: 187).\n\nMetaphors, models, and methods that tend to be \u201cgendered\u201d\nas feminine may carry connotations of subordination\u2014and so they\nmay seem inferior, yet they may be also especially useful for\nwomen and hence powerful for feminists. These approaches can provide a\npotent basis for generating alternatives to eristic standards and an\nunderstanding of the processes that may go alongside or support\narguing as a contest. Metaphors and models based on collaboration fit\nwith the work of physical and emotional care that regularly\nconstitutes women\u2019s roles and responsibilities. Yet\ncollaboration also proves quite apt for many other contexts and\nfunctions of arguing such as explanation and deliberation. Rooney\nsuggests that because people converse with rather than\nagainst each other, and because arguing is a species of\nconversation, we should speak of arguing with rather than against\npeople and their views (2010: 221). This possibility suggests that the\nargument-as-war metaphor may not be so overwhelming as to make\nalternatives unimaginable in the way Lakoff and Johnson suggest (1980:\n4). Alternative structures for argument can be found in our ordinary\nlanguage.\n\nPatterns that might seem to distinguish how women argue may not\nexpress deep cognitive differences between the genders. A range of\ncommunicative styles including gendered norms of polite discourse that\nhave people constrain their public reasoning may equally serve\ncognitive functions common to men and women. Gendered roles may even\ncomplement each other\u2019s epistemological operation. The most\naggressive and disruptive behavior will not endure norms of\npoliteness. However, some feminists consider that politeness can\nrequire conformity to structures of social authority that marginalize\nwomen, people of color, and others belonging to subordinated social\ncategories.\n",
