Weber\u2019s wide-ranging\ncontributions gave critical impetus to the birth of new academic\ndisciplines such as sociology as well as to the significant\nreorientation in law, economics, political science, and religious\nstudies. His methodological writings were instrumental in establishing\nthe self-identity of modern social science as a distinct field of\ninquiry; he is still claimed as the source of inspiration by empirical\npositivists and their hermeneutic detractors alike. More\nsubstantively, Weber\u2019s two most celebrated contributions were\nthe \u201crationalization thesis,\u201d a grand meta-historical\nanalysis of the dominance of the west in modern times, and the\n\u201cProtestant Ethic thesis,\u201d a non-Marxist genealogy of\nmodern capitalism. Together, these two theses helped launch his\nreputation as one of the founding theorists of modernity. In addition,\nhis avid interest and participation in politics led to a unique strand\nof political realism comparable to that of Machiavelli and Hobbes. As\nsuch, Max Weber\u2019s influence was far-reaching across the vast\narray of disciplinary, methodological, ideological and philosophical\nreflections that are still our own and increasingly more so.\n", "toc": [{"#LifeCare": "1.

Life and Career\n\nMaximilian Carl Emil \u201cMax\u201d Weber (1864\u20131920) was\nborn in the Prussian city of Erfurt to a family of notable heritage.\nHis father, Max Sr., came from a Westphalian family of merchants and\nindustrialists in the textile business and went on to become a lawyer\nand National Liberal parliamentarian in Wilhelmine politics. His\nmother, Helene, came from the Fallenstein and Souchay families, both\nof the long illustrious Huguenot line, which had for generations\nproduced public servants and academicians. His younger brother,\nAlfred, was an influential political economist and sociologist, too.\nEvidently, Max Weber was brought up in a prosperous, cosmopolitan, and\ncultivated family milieu that was well-plugged into the political,\nsocial, and cultural establishment of the German\nB\u00fcrgertum [Roth 2000]. Also, his parents represented\ntwo, often conflicting, poles of identity between which their eldest\nson would struggle throughout his life \u2013 worldly statesmanship\nand ascetic scholarship.\n\nEducated mainly at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, Weber\nwas trained in law, eventually writing his dissertation on medieval\ntrading companies under Levin Goldschmidt and Rudolf von Gneist (and\nexamined by Theodor Mommsen) and Habilitationsschrift on\nRoman law and agrarian history under August Meitzen. While\ncontemplating a career in legal practice and public service, he\nreceived an important research commission from the Verein f\u00fcr\nSozialpolitik (the leading social science association under\nGustav Schmoller\u2019s leadership) and produced the so-called East\nElbian Report on the displacement of the German agrarian workers in\nEast Prussia by Polish migrant labours. Greeted upon publication with\nhigh acclaim and political controversy, this early success led to his\nfirst university appointment at Freiburg in 1894 to be followed by a\nprestigious professorship in political economy at Heidelberg two years\nlater. Weber and his wife Marianne, an intellectual in her own right\nand early women\u2019s rights activist, soon found themselves at the\ncenter of the vibrant intellectual and cultural life of Heidelberg.\nThe so-called \u201cWeber Circle\u201d attracted such intellectual\nluminaries as Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, and Werner Sombart and\nlater a number of younger scholars including Marc Bloch, Robert\nMichels, and Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs. Weber was also active in\npublic life as he continued to play an important role as a Young Turk\nin the Verein and maintain a close association with the\nliberal Evangelische-soziale Kongress (especially with the\nleader of its younger generation, Friedrich Naumann). It was during\nthis time that he solidified his reputation as a brilliant political\neconomist and outspoken public intellectual.\n\nAll these fruitful years came to an abrupt halt in 1897 when Weber\ncollapsed with a nervous-breakdown shortly after his father\u2019s\nsudden death (precipitated by a confrontation with Weber) [Radkau\n2011, 53\u201369]. His routine as a teacher and scholar was\ninterrupted so badly that he eventually withdrew from regular teaching\nduties in 1903, to which he would not return until 1919. Although\nseverely compromised and unable to write as prolifically as before, he\nstill managed to immerse himself in the study of various philosophical\nand religious topics. This period saw a new direction in his\nscholarship as the publication of miscellaneous methodological essays\nas well as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\n(1904\u20131905) testifies. Also noteworthy about this period is his\nextensive trip to America in 1904, which left an indelible trace in\nhis understanding of modernity in general [Scaff 2011].\n\nAfter this stint essentially as a private scholar, he slowly resumed\nhis participation in various academic and public activities. With\nEdgar Jaff\u00e9 and Sombart, he took over editorial control of the\nArchiv f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften und Sozialpolitik,\nturning it into a leading social science journal of the day as well as\nhis new institutional platform. In 1909, he co-founded the\nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Soziologie, in part as a\nresult of his growing unease with the Verein\u2019s\nconservative politics and lack of methodological discipline, becoming\nits first treasurer (he would resign from it in 1912, though). This\nperiod of his life, until interrupted by the outbreak of the First\nWorld War in 1914, brought the pinnacles of his achievements as he\nworked intensely in two areas \u2013 the comparative sociology of\nworld religions and his contributions to the Grundriss der\nSozial\u00f6konomik (to be published posthumously as Economy\nand Society). Along with the major methodological essays that he\ndrafted during this time, these works would become mainly responsible\nfor Weber\u2019s enduring reputation as one of the founding fathers\nof modern social science.\n\nWith the onset of the First World War, Weber\u2019s involvement in\npublic life took an unexpected turn. At first a fervent patriotic\nsupporter of the war, as virtually all German intellectuals of the\ntime were, he grew disillusioned with the German war policies,\neventually refashioning himself as one of the most vocal critics of\nthe Kaiser government in a time of war. As a public intellectual, he\nissued private reports to government leaders and wrote journalistic\npieces to warn against the Belgian annexation policy and the unlimited\nsubmarine warfare, which, as the war deepened, evolved into a call for\noverall democratization of the authoritarian state\n(Obrigkeitsstaat) that was Wilhelmine Germany. By 1917, Weber\nwas campaigning vigorously for a wholesale constitutional reform for\npost-war Germany, including the introduction of universal suffrage and\nthe empowerment of parliament.\n\nWhen defeat came in 1918, Germany found in Weber a public intellectual\nleader, even possibly a future statesman, with unscathed liberal\ncredentials who was well-positioned to influence the course of\npost-war reconstruction. He was invited to join the draft board of the\nWeimar Constitution as well as the German delegation to Versaille;\nalbeit in vain, he even ran for a parliamentary seat on the liberal\nDemocratic Party ticket. In those capacities, however, he opposed the\nGerman Revolution (all too sensibly) and the Versaille Treaty (all too\nquixotically) alike, putting himself in an unsustainable position that\ndefied the partisan alignments of the day. By all accounts, his\npolitical activities bore little fruit, except his advocacy for a\nrobust plebiscitary presidency in the Weimar Constitution.\n\nFrustrated with day-to-day politics, he turned to his scholarly\npursuits with renewed vigour. In 1919, he briefly taught in turn at\nthe universities of Vienna (General Economic History was an\noutcome of this experience) and Munich (where he gave the much-lauded\nlectures, Science as a Vocation and Politics as a\nVocation), while compiling his scattered writings on religion in\nthe form of massive three-volume Gesammelte Aufs\u00e4tze zur\nReligionssoziologie [GARS hereafter]. All these\nreinvigorated scholarly activities came to an end in 1920 when he died\nsuddenly of pneumonia in Munich (likely due to the Spanish flu). Max\nWeber was fifty-six years old.\n2. Philosophical Influences\n\nPutting Weber in the context of philosophical tradition proper is not\nan easy task. For all the astonishing variety of identities that can\nbe ascribed to him as a scholar, he was certainly no philosopher at\nleast in the narrow sense of the term. His reputation as a Solonic\nlegislator of modern social science also tends to cloud our\nappreciation of the extent to which his ideas were embedded in the\nintellectual context of the time. Broadly speaking, Weber\u2019s\nphilosophical worldview, if not coherent philosophy, was informed by\nthe deep crisis of the Enlightenment project in fin-de-si\u00e8cle\nEurope, which was characterized by the intellectual revolt against\npositivist reason, a celebration of subjective will and intuition, and\na neo-Romantic longing for spiritual wholesomeness [Hughes 1977]. In\nother words, Weber belonged to a generation of self-claimed epigones\nwho had to struggle with the legacies of Darwin, Marx, and Nietzsche.\nAs such, the philosophical backdrop to his thoughts will be outlined\nhere along two axes \u2014 epistemology and ethics.\n2.1 Knowledge: Neo-Kantianism\n\nWeber encountered the pan-European cultural crisis of his time mainly\nas filtered through the jargon of German Historicism [Beiser 2011].\nHis early training in law had exposed him to the sharp divide between\nthe reigning Labandian legal positivism and the historical\njurisprudence championed by Otto von Gierke (one of his teachers at\nBerlin); in his later incarnation as a political economist, he was\nkeenly interested in the heated \u201cstrife over methods\u201d\n(Methodenstreit) between the positivist economic methodology\nof Carl Menger and the historical economics of Schmoller (his mentor\nduring the early days). Arguably, however, it was not until Weber grew\nacquainted with the Baden or Southwestern School of Neo-Kantians,\nespecially through Wilhelm Windelband, Emil Lask, and Heinrich Rickert\n(his one-time colleague at Freiburg), that he found a rich conceptual\ntemplate suitable for the clearer elaboration of his own\nepistemological position.\n\nIn opposition to a Hegelian emanationist epistemology, briefly,\nNeo-Kantians shared the Kantian dichotomy between reality and concept.\nNot an emanent derivative of concepts as Hegel posited, reality is\nirrational and incomprehensible, and the concept, only an abstract\nconstruction of our mind. Nor is the concept a matter of will,\nintuition, and subjective consciousness as Wilhelm Dilthey posited.\nAccording to Hermann Cohen, one of the early Neo-Kantians, concept\nformation is fundamentally a cognitive process, which cannot but be\nrational as Kant held. If our cognition is logical and all reality\nexists within cognition, then only a reality that we can comprehend in\nthe form of knowledge is rational \u2013 metaphysics is thereby\nreduced to epistemology, and Being to logic. As such, the process of\nconcept formation both in the natural (Natur-) and the\ncultural-historical sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) has to\nbe universal as well as abstract, not different in kind but in their\nsubject matters. The latter is only different in dealing with the\nquestion of values in addition to logical relationships.\n\nFor Windelband, however, the difference between the two kinds of\nknowledge has to do with its aim and method as well.\nCultural-historical knowledge is not concerned with a phenomenon\nbecause of what it shares with other phenomena, but rather because of\nits own definitive qualities. For values, which form its proper\nsubject, are radically subjective, concrete and individualistic.\nUnlike the \u201cnomothetic\u201d knowledge that natural science\nseeks, what matters in historical science is not a universal law-like\ncausality, but an understanding of the particular way in which an\nindividual ascribes values to certain events and institutions or takes\na position towards the general cultural values of his/her time under a\nunique, never-to-be-repeated constellation of historical\ncircumstances. Therefore, cultural-historical science seeks\n\u201cideographic\u201d knowledge; it aims to understand the\nparticular, concrete and irrational \u201chistorical\nindividual\u201d with inescapably universal, abstract, and\nrational concepts. Turning irrational reality into rational concept,\nit does not simply paint (abbilden) a picture of reality but\ntransforms (umbilden) it. Occupying the gray area between\nirrational reality and rational concept, then, its question became\ntwofold for the Neo-Kantians. One is in what way we can understand the\nirreducibly subjective values held by the historical actors in an\nobjective fashion, and the other, by what criteria we can select a\ncertain historical phenomenon as opposed to another as historically\nsignificant subject matter worthy of our attention. In short, the\nissue was not only the values to be comprehended by the seeker of\nhistorical knowledge, but also his/her own values, which are no less\nsubjective. Value-judgment (Werturteil) as well as value\n(Wert) became a keen issue.\n\nAccording to Rickert\u2019s definitive elaboration, value-judgment\nprecedes values. He posits that the \u201cin-dividual,\u201d as\nopposed to mere \u201cindividual,\u201d phenomenon can be isolated\nas a discrete subject of our historical inquiry when we ascribe\ncertain subjective values to the singular coherence and indivisibility\nthat are responsible for its uniqueness. In his theory of\nvalue-relation (Wertbeziehung), Rickert argues that relating\nhistorical objects to values can still retain objective validity when\nit is based on a series of explicitly formulated conceptual\ndistinctions. They are to be made firmly between the\ninvestigator\u2019s values and those of the historical actor under\ninvestigation, between personal or private values and general cultural\nvalues of the time, and between subjective value-judgment and\nobjective value-relations. In so positing, however, Rickert is making\ntwo highly questionable assumptions. One is that there are certain\nvalues in every culture that are universally accepted within that\nculture as valid, and the other, that a historian free of bias must\nagree on what these values are. Just as natural science must assume\n\u201cunconditionally and universally valid laws of nature,\u201d\nso, too, cultural-historical science must assume that there are\n\u201cunconditionally and universally valid values.\u201d If so, an\n\u201cin-dividual\u201d historical event has to be reduced to an\n\u201cindividual\u201d manifestation of the objective process of\nhistory, a conclusion that essentially implies that Rickert returned\nto the German Idealist faith in the meaningfulness of history and the\nobjective validity of the diverse values to be found in history. An\nempirical study in historical science, in the end, cannot do without a\nmetaphysics of history. Bridging irrational reality and rational\nconcept in historical science, or overcoming hiatus\nirrationalis (\u00e0 la Emil Lask) without recourse to a\nmetaphysics of history still remained a problem as acutely as before.\nWhile accepting the broadly neo-Kantian conceptual template as Rickert\nelaborated it, Weber\u2019s methodological writings would turn mostly\non this issue.\n2.2 Ethics: Kant and Nietzsche\n\nGerman Idealism seems to have exerted another enduring influence on\nWeber, discernible in his ethical worldview more than in his\nepistemological position. This was the strand of Idealist discourse in\nwhich a broadly Kantian ethic and its Nietzschean interlocution figure\nprominently.\n\nThe way in which Weber understood Kant seems to have come through the\nconceptual template set by moral psychology and philosophical\nanthropology. In conscious opposition to the utilitarian-naturalistic\njustification of modern individualism, Kant viewed moral action as\nprincipled and self-disciplined while expressive of genuine freedom\nand autonomy. On this Kantian view, freedom and autonomy are to be\nfound in the instrumental control of the self and the world\n(objectification) according to a law formulated solely from within\n(subjectification). Furthermore, such a paradoxical compound is made\npossible by an internalization or willful acceptance of a\ntranscendental rational principle, which saves it from falling prey to\nthe hedonistic subjectification that Kant found in Enlightenment\nnaturalism and which he so detested. Kant in this regard follows\nRousseau in condemning utilitarianism; instrumental-rational control\nof the world in the service of our desires and needs just degenerates\ninto organized egoism. In order to prevent it, mere freedom of choice\nbased on elective will (Willk\u00fcr) has to be replaced by\nthe exercise of purely rational will (Wille) [Taylor 1989,\n364]. The so-called \u201cinward turn\u201d is thus the crucial\nbenchmark of autonomous moral agency for Kant, but its basis has been\nfundamentally altered; it should be done with the purpose of serving a\nhigher end, that is, the universal law of reason. A willful\nself-transformation is demanded now in the service of a higher law\nbased on reason, or an \u201cultimate value\u201d in Weber\u2019s\nparlance.\n\nWeber\u2019s understanding of this Kantian ethical template was\nstrongly tinged by the Protestant theological debate taking place in\nthe Germany of his time between (orthodox Lutheran) Albrecht Ritschl\nand Matthias Schneckenburger (of Calvinist persuasion), a context with\nwhich Weber became acquainted through his Heidelberg colleague,\nTroeltsch. Suffice it to note in this connection that Weber\u2019s\nsharp critique of Ritschl\u2019s Lutheran communitarianism seems\nreflective of his broadly Kantian preoccupation with radically\nsubjective individualism and the methodical transformation of the self\n[Graf 1995].\n\nAll in all, one might say that \u201cthe preoccupations of Kant and\nof Weber are really the same. One was a philosopher and the other a\nsociologist, but there\u2026 the difference ends\u201d [Gellner\n1974, 184]. That which also ends, however, is Weber\u2019s\nsubscription to a Kantian ethic of duty when it comes to the\npossibility of a universal law of reason. Weber was keenly aware of\nthe fact that the Kantian linkage between growing self-consciousness,\nthe possibility of universal law, and principled and thus free action\nhad been irrevocably severed. Kant managed to preserve the precarious\nidentification of non-arbitrary action and subjective freedom by\nasserting such a linkage, which Weber believed to be unsustainable in\nhis allegedly Nietzschean age.\n\nAccording to Nietzsche, \u201cwill to truth\u201d cannot be content\nwith the metaphysical construction of a grand metanarrative, whether\nit be monotheistic religion or modern science, and growing\nself-consciousness, or \u201cintellectualization\u201d \u00e0 la\nWeber, can lead only to a radical skepticism, value relativism, or,\neven worse, nihilism. According to such a Historicist diagnosis of\nmodernity that culminates in the \u201cdeath of God,\u201d the\nalternative seems to be either a radical self-assertion and\nself-creation that runs the risk of being arbitrary (as in Nietzsche)\nor a complete desertion of the modern ideal of self-autonomous freedom\n(as in early Foucault). If the first approach leads to a radical\ndivinization of humanity, one possible extension of modern humanism,\nthe second leads inexorably to a \u201cdedivinization\u201d of\nhumanity, a postmodern antihumanism [Vattimo 1988, 31\u201347].\n\nSeen in this light, Weber\u2019s ethical sensibility is built on a\nfirm rejection of a Nietzschean divination and Foucaultian resignation\nalike, both of which are radically at odds with the Kantian ethic of\nduty. In other words, Weber\u2019s ethical project can be described\nas a search for non-arbitrary freedom (his Kantian side) in what he\nperceived as an increasingly post-metaphysical world (his Nietzschean\nside). According to Paul Honigsheim, Weber\u2019s ethic is that of\n\u201ctragedy\u201d and \u201cnevertheless\u201d [Honigsheim 2013,\n113]. This deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a\nNietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what\ngives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber\u2019s ethical\nworldview.\n3. History\n3.1 Rationalization as a Thematic Unity\n\nWeber\u2019s main contribution as such, nonetheless, lies neither in\nepistemology nor in ethics. Although they deeply informed his thoughts\nto an extent still under-appreciated, his main concern lay elsewhere.\nHe was after all one of the founding fathers of modern social science.\nBeyond the recognition, however, that Weber is not simply a\nsociologist par excellence as Talcott Parsons\u2019s\nquasi-Durkheimian interpretation made him out to be, identifying an\nid\u00e9e ma\u00eetresse throughout his disparate oeuvre\nhas been debated ever since his own days and is still far from\nsettled. Economy and Society, his alleged magnum\nopus, was a posthumous publication based upon his widow\u2019s\neditorship, the thematic architectonic of which is unlikely to be\nreconstructed beyond doubt even after its recent reissuing under the\nrubric of Max Weber Gesamtausgabe [MWG hereafter].\nGARS forms a more coherent whole since its editorial edifice\nwas the work of Weber himself; and yet, its relationship to his other\nsociologies of, for instance, law, city, music, domination, and\neconomy, remains controvertible. Accordingly, his overarching theme\nhas also been variously surmised as a developmental history of Western\nrationalism (Wolfgang Schluchter), the universal history of\nrationalist culture (Friedrich Tenbruck), or simply the\nMenschentum as it emerges and degenerates in modern rational\nsociety (Wilhelm Hennis). The first depicts Weber as a\ncomparative-historical sociologist; the second, a latter-day Idealist\nhistorian of culture reminiscent of Jacob Burckhardt; and the third, a\npolitical philosopher on a par with Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau.\nImportant as they are for in-house Weber scholarship, however, these\nphilological disputes need not hamper our attempt to grasp the gist of\nhis ideas. Suffice it for us to recognize that, albeit with varying\ndegrees of emphasis, these different interpretations all converge on\nthe thematic centrality of rationality, rationalism, and\nrationalization in making sense of Weber.\n\nAt the outset, what immediately strikes a student of Weber\u2019s\nrationalization thesis is its seeming irreversibility and\nEurocentrism. The apocalyptic imagery of the \u201ciron cage\u201d\nthat haunts the concluding pages of the Protestant Ethic is\ncommonly taken to reflect his fatalism about the inexorable unfolding\nof rationalization and its culmination in the complete loss of freedom\nand meaning in the modern world. The \u201cAuthor\u2019s\nIntroduction\u201d (Vorbemerkung to GARS) also\ncontains oft-quoted passages that allegedly disclose Weber\u2019s\nbelief in the unique singularity of Western civilization\u2019s\nachievement in the direction of rationalization, or lack thereof in\nother parts of the world. For example:\n\nA child of modern European civilization (Kulturwelt) who\nstudies problems of universal history shall inevitably and justfiably\nraise the question (Fragestellung): what combination of\ncircumstances have led to the fact that in the West, and here only,\ncultural phenomena have appeared which \u2013 at least as we\nlike to think \u2013 came to have universal significance and\nvalidity [Weber 1920/1992, 13: translation altered]?\n\n\nTaken together, then, the rationalization process as Weber narrated it\nseems quite akin to a metahistorical teleology that irrevocably sets\nthe West apart from and indeed above the East.\n\nAt the same time, nonetheless, Weber adamantly denied the possibility\nof a universal law of history in his methodological essays. Even\nwithin the same pages of Vorbemerkung, he said,\n\u201crationalizations of the most varied character have existed in\nvarious departments of life and in all areas of culture\u201d\n[Ibid., 26]. He also made clear that his study of various\nforms of world religions was to be taken for its heuristic value\nrather than as \u201ccomplete analyses of cultures, however\nbrief\u201d [Ibid., 27]. It was meant as a\ncomparative-conceptual platform on which to erect the edifying\nfeatures of rationalization in the West. If merely a heuristic device\nand not a universal law of progress, then, what is rationalization and\nwhence comes his uncompromisingly dystopian vision?\n3.2 Calculability, Predictability, and World-Mastery\n\nRoughly put, taking place in all areas of human life from religion and\nlaw to music and architecture, rationalization means a historical\ndrive towards a world in which \u201cone can, in principle, master\nall things by calculation\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 139]. For instance,\nmodern capitalism is a rational mode of economic life because it\ndepends on a calculable process of production. This search for exact\ncalculability underpins such institutional innovations as monetary\naccounting (especially double-entry bookkeeping), centralization of\nproduction control, separation of workers from the means of\nproduction, supply of formally free labour, disciplined control on the\nfactory floor, and other features that make modern capitalism\nqualitatively different from all other modes of organizing\neconomic life. The enhanced calculability of the production process is\nalso buttressed by that in non-economic spheres such as law and\nadministration. Legal formalism and bureaucratic management reinforce\nthe elements of predictability in the sociopolitical environment that\nencumbers industrial capitalism by means of introducing formal\nequality of citizenship, a rule-bound legislation of legal norms, an\nautonomous judiciary, and a depoliticized professional bureaucracy.\nFurther, all this calculability and predictability in political,\nsocial, and economic spheres was not possible without changes of\nvalues in ethics, religion, psychology, and culture. Institutional\nrationalization was, in other words, predicated upon the rise of a\npeculiarly rational type of personality, or a \u201cperson of\nvocation\u201d (Berufsmensch) as outlined in the\nProtestant Ethic. The outcome of this complex interplay of\nideas and interests was modern rational Western civilization with its\nenormous material and cultural capacity for relentless\nworld-mastery.\n3.3 Knowledge, Impersonality, and Control\n\nOn a more analytical plateau, all these disparate processes of\nrationalization can be surmised as increasing knowledge, growing\nimpersonality, and enhanced control [Brubaker 1991, 32\u201335].\nFirst, knowledge. Rational action in one very general sense\npresupposes knowledge. It requires some knowledge of the ideational\nand material circumstances in which our action is embedded, since to\nact rationally is to act on the basis of conscious reflection about\nthe probable consequences of action. As such, the knowledge that\nunderpins a rational action is of a causal nature conceived in terms\nof means-ends relationships, aspiring towards a systematic, logically\ninterconnected whole. Modern scientific and technological knowledge is\na culmination of this process that Weber called intellectualization,\nin the course of which, the germinating grounds of human knowledge in\nthe past, such as religion, theology, and metaphysics, were slowly\npushed back to the realm of the superstitious, mystical, or simply\nirrational. It is only in modern Western civilization, according to\nWeber, that this gradual process of disenchantment\n(Entzauberung) has reached its radical conclusion.\n\nSecond, impersonality. Rationalization, according to Weber, entails\nobjectification (Versachlichung). Industrial capitalism, for\none, reduces workers to sheer numbers in an accounting book,\ncompletely free from the fetters of tradition and non-economic\nconsiderations, and so does the market relationship vis-\u00e0-vis\nbuyers and sellers. For another, having abandoned the principle of\nKhadi justice (i.e., personalized ad hoc adjudication),\nmodern law and administration also rule in strict accordance with the\nsystematic formal codes and sine ira et studio, that is,\n\u201cwithout anger or passion.\u201d Again, Weber found the seed of\nobjectification not in material interests alone, but in the Puritan\nvocational ethic (Berufsethik) and the life conduct that it\ninspired, which was predicated upon a disenchanted monotheistic\ntheodicy that reduced humans to mere tools of God\u2019s providence.\nIronically, for Weber, modern inward subjectivity was born once we\nlost any inherent value qua humans and became thoroughly\nobjectified vis-\u00e0-vis God in the course of the Reformation.\nModern individuals are subjectified and objectified all at once.\n\nThird, control. Pervasive in Weber\u2019s view of rationalization is\nthe increasing control in social and material life. Scientific and\ntechnical rationalization has greatly improved both the human capacity\nfor a mastery over nature and institutionalized discipline\nvia bureaucratic administration, legal formalism, and\nindustrial capitalism. The calculable, disciplined control over humans\nwas, again, an unintended consequence of the Puritan ethic of rigorous\nself-discipline and self-control, or what Weber called\n\u201cinnerworldly asceticism (innerweltliche\nAskese).\u201d Here again, Weber saw the irony that a modern\nindividual citizen equipped with inviolable rights was born as a part\nof the rational, disciplinary ethos that increasingly penetrated into\nevery aspect of social life.\n4. Modernity\n4.1 The \u201cIron Cage\u201d and Value-fragmentation\n\nThus seen, rationalization as Weber postulated it is anything but an\nunequivocal historical phenomenon. As already pointed out, first,\nWeber viewed it as a process taking place in disparate fields of human\nlife with a logic of each field\u2019s own and varying directions;\n\u201ceach one of these fields may be rationalized in terms of very\ndifferent ultimate values and ends, and what is rational from one\npoint of view may well be irrational from another\u201d [Weber\n1920/1992, 27]. Second, and more important, its ethical ramification\nfor Weber is deeply ambivalent. To use his own dichotomy, the\nformal-procedural rationality (Zweckrationalit\u00e4t) to\nwhich Western rationalization tends does not necessarily go with a\nsubstantive-value rationality (Wertrationalit\u00e4t). On the\none hand, exact calculability and predictability in the social\nenvironment that formal rationalization has brought about dramatically\nenhances individual freedom by helping individuals understand and\nnavigate through the complex web of practice and institutions in order\nto realize the ends of their own choice. On the other hand, freedom\nand agency are seriously curtailed by the same force in history when\nindividuals are reduced to a \u201ccog in a machine,\u201d or\ntrapped in an \u201ciron cage\u201d that formal rationalization has\nspawned with irresistible efficiency and at the expense of substantive\nrationality. Thus, his famous lament in the Protestant\nEthic:\n\nNo one knows who will live in this cage (Geh\u00e4use) in the\nfuture, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely\nnew prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas\nand ideals, or, if neither, mechanized petrification, embellished with\na sort of convulsive self-importance. For the \u201clast man\u201d\n(letzten Menschen) of this cultural development, it might\nwell be truly said: \u201cSpecialist without spirit, sensualist\nwithout heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of\nhumanity (Menschentums) never before achieved\u201d [Weber\n1904\u201305/1992, 182: translation altered].\n\n\nThird, Weber envisions the future of rationalization not only in terms\nof \u201cmechanized petrification,\u201d but also of a chaotic, even\natrophic, inundation of subjective values. In other words, the\nbureaucratic \u201ciron cage\u201d is only one side of the modernity\nthat rationalization has brought about; the other is a\n\u201cpolytheism\u201d of value-fragmentation. At the apex of\nrationalization, we moderns have suddenly found ourselves living\n\u201cas did the ancients when their world was not yet disenchanted\nof its gods and demons\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. Modern society\nis, Weber seems to say, once again enchanted as a result of\ndisenchantment. How did this happen and with what consequences?\n4.2 Reenchantment via Disenchantment\n\nIn point of fact, Weber\u2019s rationalization thesis can be\nunderstood with richer nuance when we approach it as, for lack of\nbetter terms, a dialectics of disenchantment and reenchantment rather\nthan as a one-sided, unilinear process of secularization.\nDisenchantment had ushered in monotheistic religions in the West. In\npractice, this means that ad hoc maxims for life-conduct had\nbeen gradually displaced by a unified total system of meaning and\nvalue, which historically culminated in the Puritan ethic of vocation.\nHere, the irony was that disenchantment was an ongoing process\nnonetheless. Disenchantment in its second phase pushed aside\nmonotheistic religion as something irrational, thus delegitimating it\nas a unifying worldview in the modern secular world.\n\nModern science, which was singularly responsible for this late\ndevelopment, was initially welcomed as a surrogate system of orderly\nvalue-creation, as Weber found in the convictions of Bacon (science as\n\u201cthe road to true nature\u201d) and Descartes (as\n\u201cthe road to the true god\u201d) [Weber 1919/1946,\n142]. For Weber, nevertheless, modern science is a deeply nihilistic\nenterprise in which any scientific achievement worthy of the name\nmust \u201cask to be surpassed and made obsolete\u201d in a\nprocess \u201cthat is in principle ad infinitum,\u201d at\nwhich point, \u201cwe come to the problem of the meaning of\nscience.\u201d He went on to ask: \u201cFor it is simply not\nself-evident that something which is subject to such a law is in\nitself meaningful and rational. Why should one do something which in\nreality never comes to an end and never can?\u201d [Ibid.,\n138: translation altered]. In short, modern science has relentlessly\ndismantled all other sources of value-creation, in the course of which\nits own meaning has also been dissipated beyond repair. The result is\nthe \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung of all evaluative\nperspectives\u201d including its own [Weber 1904/1949, 86].\n\nIrretrievably gone as a result is a unifying worldview, be it\nreligious or scientific, and what ensues is its fragmentation into\nincompatible value spheres. Weber, for instance, observed:\n\u201csince Nietzsche, we realize that something can be beautiful,\nnot only in spite of the aspect in which it is not good, but rather in\nthat very aspect\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. That is to say,\naesthetic values now stand in irreconcilable antagonism to religious\nvalues, transforming \u201cvalue judgments (Werturteile)\ninto judgments of taste (Geschmacksurteile) by which what is\nmorally reprehensible becomes merely what is tasteless\u201d [Weber\n1915/1946, 342].\n\nWeber is, then, not envisioning a peaceful dissolution of the\ngrand metanarratives of monotheistic religion and universal science\ninto a series of local narratives and the consequent modern pluralist\nculture in which different cultural practices follow their own\nimmanent logic. His vision of polytheistic reenchantment is rather\nthat of an incommensurable value-fragmentation into a plurality of\nalternative metanarratives, each of which claims to answer the same\nmetaphysical questions that religion and science strove to cope with\nin their own ways. The slow death of God has reached its apogee in the\nreturn of gods and demons who \u201cstrive to gain power over our\nlives and again \u2026 resume their eternal struggle with one\nanother\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 149].\n\nSeen this way, it makes sense that Weber\u2019s rationalization\nthesis concludes with two strikingly dissimilar prophecies \u2013 one\nis the imminent iron cage of bureaucratic petrification and the other,\nthe Hellenistic pluralism of warring deities. The modern world has\ncome to be monotheistic and polytheistic all at once. What seems to\nunderlie this seemingly self-contradictory imagery of modernity is the\nproblem of modern humanity (Menschentum) and its loss of\nfreedom and moral agency. Disenchantment has created a world with no\nobjectively ascertainable ground for one\u2019s conviction. Under the\ncircumstances, according to Weber, a modern individual tends to act\nonly on one\u2019s own aesthetic impulse and arbitrary convictions\nthat cannot be communicated in the eventuality; the majority of those\nwho cannot even act on their convictions, or the \u201clast men who\ninvented happiness\u201d \u00e0 la Nietzsche, lead the life of a\n\u201ccog in a machine.\u201d Whether the problem of modernity is\naccounted for in terms of a permeation of objective, instrumental\nrationality or of a purposeless agitation of subjective values, Weber\nviewed these two images as constituting a single problem insofar as\nthey contributed to the inertia of modern individuals who fail to take\nprincipled moral action. The \u201csensualists without heart\u201d\nand \u201cspecialists without spirit\u201d indeed formed two faces\nof the same coin that may be called the disempowerment of the\nmodern self.\n4.3 Modernity contra Modernization\n\nOnce things were different, Weber claimed. An unflinching sense of\nconviction that relied on nothing but one\u2019s innermost\npersonality once issued in a highly methodical and disciplined conduct\nof everyday life \u2013 or, simply, life as a duty. Born in the\ncrucible of the Reformation, this archetypal modern subjectivity drew\nits strength solely from within in the sense that one\u2019s\nprinciple of action was determined by one\u2019s own psychological\nneed to gain self-affirmation. Also, the way in which this deeply\nintrospective subjectivity was practiced, that is, in self-mastery,\nentailed a highly rational and radically methodical attitude towards\none\u2019s inner self and the outer, objective world. Transforming\nthe self into an integrated personality and mastering the world with\ntireless energy, subjective value and objective rationality once\nformed \u201cone unbroken whole\u201d [Weber 1910/1978, 319]. Weber\ncalls the agent of this unity the \u201cperson of vocation\u201d\n(Berufsmensch) in his religious writings,\n\u201cpersonality\u201d (Pers\u00f6nlichkeit) in the\nmethodological essays, \u201cgenuine politician\u201d\n(Berufspolitiker) in the political writings, and\n\u201ccharismatic individual\u201d in Economy and Society.\nThe much-celebrated Protestant Ethic thesis was indeed a genealogical\nreconsturction of this idiosyncratic moral agency in modern times\n[Goldman 1992].\n\nOnce different, too, was the mode of society constituted by and in\nturn constitutive of this type of moral agency. Weber\u2019s social\nimagination revealed its keenest sense of irony when he traced the\nroot of the cohesive integration, intense socialization, and severe\ncommunal discipline of sect-like associations to the isolated and\nintrospective subjectivity of the Puritan person of vocation. The\nirony was that the self-absorbed, anxiety-ridden and even antisocial\nvirtues of the person of vocation could be sustained only in the thick\ndisciplinary milieu of small-scale associational life. Membership in\nexclusive voluntary associational life is open, and it is such\nmembership, or \u201cachieved quality,\u201d that guarantees the\nethical qualities of the individuals with whom one interacts.\n\u201cThe old \u2018sect spirit\u2019 holds sway with relentless\neffect in the intrinsic nature of such associations,\u201d Weber\nobserved, for the sect was the first mass organization to combine\nindividual agency and social discipline in such a systematic way.\nWeber thus claimed that \u201cthe ascetic conventicles and sects\n\u2026 formed one of the most important foundations of modern\nindividualism\u201d [Weber 1920/1946, 321]. It seems clear that what\nWeber was trying to outline here is an archetypical form of social\norganization that can empower individual moral agency by sustaining\ngroup disciplinary dynamism, a kind of pluralistically organized\nsocial life we would now call a \u201ccivil society\u201d [Kim 2007,\n57\u201394].\n\nTo summarize, the irony with which Weber accounted for rationalization\nwas driven by the deepening tension between modernity and\nmodernization. Weber\u2019s problem with modernity\noriginates from the fact that it required a historically unique\nconstellation of cultural values and social institutions, and yet,\nmodernization has effectively undermined the cultural basis for modern\nindividualism and its germinating ground of disciplinary society,\nwhich together had given the original impetus to modernity. The modern\nproject has fallen victim to its own success, and in peril is the\nindividual moral agency and freedom. Under the late modern\ncircumstances characterized by the \u201ciron cage\u201d and\n\u201cwarring deities,\u201d then, Weber\u2019s question becomes:\n\u201cHow is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of\n\u2018individual\u2019 freedom of movement in any sense\ngiven this all-powerful trend\u201d [Weber 1918/1994, 159]?\n5. Knowledge\n\nSuch an appreciation of Weber\u2019s main problematic, which\nculminates in the question of modern individual freedom, may help shed\nlight on some of the controversial aspects of Weber\u2019s\nmethodology. In accounting for his methodological claims, it needs to\nbe borne in mind that Weber was not at all interested in writing a\nsystematic epistemological treatise in order to put an end to the\n\u201cstrife over methods\u201d (Methodenstreit) of his\ntime between historicism and positivism. His ambition was much more\nmodest and pragmatic. Just as \u201cthe person who attempted to walk\nby constantly applying anatomical knowledge would be in danger of\nstumbling\u201d [Weber 1906/1949, 115; translation altered], so can\nmethodology be a kind of knowledge that may supply a rule of thumb,\ncodified a posteriori, for what historians and social\nscientists do, but it could never substitute for the skills they use\nin their research practice. Instead, Weber\u2019s attempt to mediate\nhistoricism and positivism was meant to aid an actual researcher make\na practical value-judgment that is fair and acceptable in the\nface of the plethora of subjective values that one encounters when\nselecting and processing historical data. After all, the questions\nthat drove his methodological reflections were what it means to\npractice science in the modern polytheistic world and how one can do\nscience with a sense of vocation. In his own words, \u201cthe\ncapacity to distinguish between empirical knowledge and\nvalue-judgments, and the fulfillment of the scientific duty to see the\nfactual truth as well as the practical duty to stand up for our own\nideals constitute the program to which we wish to adhere with ever\nincreasing firmness\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 58]. Sheldon Wolin thus\nconcludes that Weber \u201cformulated the idea of methodology to\nserve, not simply as a guide to investigation but as a moral practice\nand a mode of political action\u201d [Wolin 1981, 414]. In short,\nWeber\u2019s methodology was as ethical as it was\nepistemological.\n5.1 Understanding (Verstehen)\n\nBuilding on the Neo-Kantian nominalism outlined above [2.1], thus,\nWeber\u2019s contribution to methodology turned mostly on the\nquestion of objectivity and the role of subjective values in\nhistorical and cultural concept formation. On the one hand, he\nfollowed Windelband in positing that historical and cultural knowledge\nis categorically distinct from natural scientific knowledge. Action\nthat is the subject of any social scientific inquiry is clearly\ndifferent from mere behaviour. While behaviour can be accounted for\nwithout reference to inner motives and thus can be reduced to mere\naggregate numbers, making it possible to establish positivistic\nregularities, and even laws, of collective behaviour, an action can\nonly be interpreted because it is based on a radically subjective\nattribution of meaning and values to what one does. What a social\nscientist seeks to understand is this subjective dimension of human\nconduct as it relates to others. On the other hand, an\nunderstanding(Verstehen) in this subjective sense is not\nanchored in a non-cognitive empathy or intuitive appreciation that is\narational by nature; it can gain objective validity when the meanings\nand values to be comprehended are explained causally, that is, as a\nmeans to an end. A teleological contextualization of an action in the\nmeans-end nexus is indeed the precondition for a causal explanation\nthat can be objectively ascertained. So far, Weber is not essentially\nin disagreement with Rickert.\n\nFrom Weber\u2019s perspective, however, the problem that\nRickert\u2019s formulation raised was the objectivity of the end to\nwhich an action is held to be oriented. As pointed out [2.1 above],\nRickert in the end had to rely on a certain transhistorical,\ntranscultural criterion in order to account for the purpose of an\naction, an assumption that cannot be warranted in Weber\u2019s view.\nTo be consistent with the Neo-Kantian presuppositions, instead, the\nends themselves have to be conceived of as no less subjective.\nImputing an end to an action is of a fictional nature in the sense\nthat it is not free from the subjective value-judgment that conditions\nthe researcher\u2019s thematization of a certain subject matter out\nof \u201can infinite multiplicity of successively and coexistently\nemerging and disappearing events\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 72].\nAlthough a counterfactual analysis might aid in stabilizing the\nprocess of causal imputation, it cannot do away completely with the\nsubjective nature of the researcher\u2019s perspective.\n\nIn the end, the kind of objective knowledge that historical and\ncultural sciences may achieve is precariously limited. An action can\nbe interpreted with objective validity only at the level of means, not\nends. An end, however, even a \u201cself-evident\u201d one, is\nirreducibly subjective, thus defying an objective understanding; it\ncan only be reconstructed conceptually based on a researcher\u2019s\nno less subjective values. Objectivity in historical and social\nsciences is, then, not a goal that can be reached with the aid of a\ncorrect method, but an ideal that must be striven for without a\npromise of ultimate fulfillment. In this sense, one might say that the\nso-called \u201cvalue-freedom\u201d (Wertfreiheit) is as\nmuch a methodological principle for Weber as an ethical virtue that a\npersonality fit for modern science must possess.\n5.2 Ideal Type\n\nThe methodology of \u201cideal type\u201d (Idealtypus) is\nanother testimony to such a broadly ethical intention of Weber.\nAccording to Weber\u2019s definition, \u201can ideal type is formed\nby the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of\nview\u201d according to which \u201cconcrete individual\nphenomena \u2026 are arranged into a unified analytical\nconstruct\u201d (Gedankenbild); in its purely fictional\nnature, it is a methodological \u201cutopia [that] cannot be found\nempirically anywhere in reality\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 90]. Keenly\naware of its fictional nature, the ideal type never seeks to claim its\nvalidity in terms of a reproduction of or a correspondence with\nreality. Its validity can be ascertained only in terms of adequacy,\nwhich is too conveniently ignored by the proponents of positivism.\nThis does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can\nbe gained by \u201cweighing the various evaluations against one\nanother and making a \u2018statesman-like\u2019 compromise among\nthem\u201d [Weber 1917/1949, 10], which is often proposed as a\nsolution by those sharing Weber\u2019s kind of methodological\nperspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls\n\u201csyncretism,\u201d is not only impossible but also unethical,\nfor it avoids \u201cthe practical duty to stand up for our own\nideals\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 58].\n\nAccording to Weber, a clear value commitment, no matter how\nsubjective, is both unavoidable and necessary. It is\nunavoidable, for otherwise no meaningful knowledge can be\nattained. Further, it is necessary, for otherwise the value\nposition of a researcher would not be foregrounded clearly and\nadmitted as such \u2013 not only to the readers of the research\noutcome but also to the very researcher him/herself. In other words,\nWeber\u2019s emphasis on \u201cone-sidedness\u201d\n(Einseitigkeit) not only affirms the subjective nature of\nscientific knowledge but also demands that the researcher be\nself-consciously subjective. The ideal type is devised for\nthis purpose, for \u201conly as an ideal type\u201d can subjective\nvalue \u2013 \u201cthat unfortunate child of misery of our\nscience\u201d \u2013 \u201cbe given an unambiguous meaning\u201d\n[Ibid., 107]. Along with value-freedom, then, what the ideal\ntype methodology entails in ethical terms is, on the one hand, a\ndaring confrontation with the tragically subjective foundation of our\nhistorical and social scientific knowledge and, on the other, a public\nconfession of one\u2019s own subjective value. Weber\u2019s\nmethodology in the end amounts to a call for the heroic\ncharacter-virtue of clear-sightedness and intellectual integrity that\ntogether constitute a genuine person of science \u2013 a scientist\nwith a sense of vocation who has a passionate commitment to\none\u2019s own specialized research, yet is utterly \u201cfree of\nillusions\u201d [L\u00f6with 1982, 38].\n6. Politics and Ethics\n\nEven more explicitly ethical than his methodology, Weber\u2019s\npolitical project also discloses his entrenched preoccupation with the\nwillful resuscitation of certain character traits in modern society.\nAt the outset, it seems undeniable that Weber was a deeply liberal\npolitical thinker especially in German context which is not well known\nfor political liberalism. This means that his ultimate value as a\npolitical thinker was locked on individual freedom, that \u201cold,\ngeneral type of human ideals\u201d [Weber 1895/1994, 19]. He was also\na bourgeois liberal, and self-consciously so, in a time of\ngreat transformations that were undermining the social conditions\nnecessary to support classical liberal values and bourgeois\ninstitutions, thereby compelling liberalism to search for a\nfundamental reorientation. To that extent, he belongs to that\ngeneration of liberal political thinkers in fin-de-si\u00e8cle\nEurope who clearly perceived the general crisis of liberalism and\nsought to resolve it in their own liberal ways [Bellamy 1992,\n157\u2013216]. Weber\u2019s own way was to address the problem of\nclassical liberal characterology that was, in his view, being\nprogressively undermined by the indiscriminate bureaucratization of\nmodern society.\n6.1 Domination and Legitimacy\n\nSuch an ethical subtext is legible even in Weber\u2019s stark realism\nthat permeates his political sociology \u2013 or, a sociology of\ndomination (Herrschaftssoziologie) as he called it [for the\nacademic use of this term in Weber\u2019s time, see Anter 2016,\n3\u201323]. For instance, utterly devoid of moral qualities that many\nof his contemporaries attributed to the state, it is defined all too\nthinly as \u201ca human community that (successfully) claims the\nmonopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a\ngiven territory\u201d [Weber 1919/1994, 310]. With the same brevity,\nhe asserted that domination of the ruled by the ruler, or more\nliterally, \u201clordship\u201d (Herrschaft), is an\nimmutable reality of political life even in a democratic state. That\nis why, for Weber, an empirical study of politics cannot but be an\ninquiry into the different modalities by which domination is\neffectuated and sustained. All the while, he also maintained that a\ndomination worthy of sustained attention is about something far more\nthan the brute fact of subjugation and subservience. For \u201cthe\nmerely external fact of the order being obeyed is not sufficient to\nsignify domination in our sense; we cannot overlook the meaning of the\nfact that the command is accepted as a valid norm\u201d\n[Weber 1921\u201322/1978, 946]. In other words, it has to be a\ndomination mediated through justification and\ninterpretation in which the ruler\u2019s claim to authority,\nnot mere threat of force or promise of benefits, is the reason for the\nobedience, not mere compliance, by the ruled. This bipolar emphasis on\nthe factuality of coercive domination at the phenomenal level and the\nessentially noumenal nature of power (\u00e0 la Rainer\nForst) is what characterizes Weber\u2019s political realism [Forst\n2012].\n\nIn terms of contemporary political realism, Weber seemed to hold that\nthe primary concern of politics is the establishment of an\norderly domination and its management within a given\nterritory rather than the realization of such pre- or extra-political\nmoral goals as justice (Kant) or freedom (Hegel) \u2013 thus the\nbrevity with which the state is defined above. Sharing this Hobbesian\noutlook on politics, or what Bernard Williams calls the \u201cFirst\nPolitical Question\u201d (FPQ), enables Weber to square his diagnosis\nof agonistic value pluralism with an entrenched suspicion of\nnatural-law foundation of liberalism to sustain a democratic politics\nthat is uniquely his own [see 6.2 below]. He went beyond Ordorealism,\nhowever, when an evaluative perspective on politics is advocated\nwithout recourse to the moral commitments coming from outside the\npolitical sphere. The making of a workable political order cannot be\nauthorized by virtue of its coming-into-being and has to satisfy what\nWilliams called the \u201cBasic Legitimation Demand\u201d (BLD) to\nbe an acceptable arrangement of social coordination. A legitimate\npolitical order is an institutionalized modus vivendi for collective\nlife that \u201cmakes sense as an intelligible order\u201d (MSIO) in\nthe eyes of the beholder [Williams 2005, 1\u201317]. Since such an\nacceptance by those living under a particular arrangement depends on\nthe political morality animating that particular community, the\nruler\u2019s claim to authority can meet with success only when based\non a reasonable fit with the local mores, values, and cultures\n[Cozzaglio and Greene 2019, 1025\u201326]. Like Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrincipe, then, Weber\u2019s Herren do not behave\nin a normless vacuum. They rule under certain political-normative\nconstraints that turn on the congruence between the way their\ndomination is justified and the way such a public\njustification is interpreted as acceptable to the ruled.\nWeber\u2019s concept of domination is as much noumenal as phenomenal.\nTo that extent, it is little wonder that his name figures not only\nprominently but also uniquely in the pantheon of political realists\n[Galston 2010].\n\nFrom this nuanced realist premise, Weber famously moved on to identify\nthree ideal types of legitimate domination based on, respectively,\ncharisma, tradition, and legal rationality. Roughly, the first type of\nlegitimacy claim depends on how persuasively the leaders prove their\ncharismatic qualities, for which they receive personal devotions and\nemotive followings from the ruled. The second kind of claim can be\nmade successfully when certain practice, custom, and mores are\ninstitutionalized to (re)produce a stable pattern of domination over a\nlong duration of time. In contrast to these crucial dependences on\npersonality traits and the passage of time, the third type of\nauthority is unfettered by time, place, and other forms of contingency\nas it derives its legitimacy from adherence to impersonal rules and\ngeneral principles that can only be found by suitable legal-rational\nreasoning. It is, along with the traditional authority, a type of\ndomination that is inclined towards the status quo in ordinary times\nas opposed to the charismatic authority that represents extraordinary,\ndisruptive, and transformative forces in history. Weber\u2019s fame\nand influence as a political thinker are built most critically upon\nthis typology and the ways in which those ideal types are deployed in\nhis political writings.\n\nAs such, Weber\u2019s sociology of domination has been suspected\nvariously of its embedded normative biases. For one, his theory of\nlegitimacy is seen as endorsing a cynical and unrealistic rejection of\nuniversal morality in politics that makes it hard to pass an objective\nand moral evaluative judgment on legitimacy claims, a charge that is\ncommonly leveled at political realism at large. Under Weber\u2019s\nconcept of legitimacy, anything goes, so to speak, as long as the\nruler goes along with the local political morality of the ruled (even\nif it is formed independently of any coercive or corrosive\ninterference by the ruler, thereby satisfying Williams\u2019s\n\u201ccritical theory principle\u201d). Read in conjunction with his\nvoluminous political writings, especially, it is criticized to this\nday as harbouring or foreshadowing, among others, Bonapartist\ncaesarism, passive-revolutionary Fordist ideology, quasi-Fascist\nelitism, and even proto-Nazism (especially with respect to his robust\nnationalism and/or nihilistic celebration of power) [inter\nalia, Strauss 1950; Marcuse in Stammer (ed.) 1971; Mommsen 1984;\nRehman 2013]. In addition to these politically heated charges,\nWeber\u2019s typology also reveals a crucial lacuna even as an\nempirical political sociology. That is to say, it allows scant, or\nambiguous, a conceptual topos for democracy.\n\nIn fact, it seems as though Weber is unsure of the proper place of\ndemocracy in his schema. At one point, democracy is deemed as a\nfourth type of legitimacy because it should be able to\nembrace legitimacy from below whereas his three ideal types\nall focus on that from above [Breuer in Schroeder (ed.) 1998,\n2]. At other times, Weber seems to believe that democracy is simply\nnon-legitimate, rather than another type of legitimate\ndomination, because it aspires to an identity between the ruler and\nthe ruled (i.e., no domination at all), but without assuming a\nhierarchical and asymmetrical relationship of power, his concept of\nlegitimacy takes hardly off the ground. Thus, Weber could describe the\nemergence of proto-democracy in the late medieval urban communes only\nin terms of \u201crevolutionary usurpation\u201d [Weber\n1921\u201322/1978, 1250], calling them the \u201cfirst\ndeliberately non-legitimate and revolutionary political\nassociation\u201d [ibid., 1302]. Too recalcitrant to fit\ninto his overall schema, in other words, these historical prototypes\nof democracy simply fall outside of his typology of\ndomination as non- or not-legitimate at all.\n\nOverlapping but still distinguishable is Weber\u2019s yet another way\nof conceptualizing democracy, which had to do with charismatic\nlegitimacy. The best example is the Puritan sect in which authority is\nlegitimated only on the grounds of a consensual order created\nvoluntarily by proven believers possessing their own quantum of\ncharismatic legitimating power. As a result of this political\ncorollary of the Protestant doctrine of universal priesthood, Puritan\nsects could and did \u201cinsist upon \u2018direct democratic\nadministration\u2019 by the congregation\u201d and thereby do away\nwith the hierarchical distinction between those ruling and those ruled\n[ibid., 1208]. In a secularized version of this group\ndynamics, a democratic ballot would become the primary tool by which\npresumed charisma of the individual lay citizenry are aggregated and\ntransmitted to their elected leader who become \u201cthe agent and\nhence the servant of his voters, not their chosen master\u201d\n[ibid., 1128]. Rather than an outright non-legitimate or\nfourth type of domination, here, democracy comes across as an\nextremely rare subset of a diffused and institutionalized form of\ncharismatic legitimacy.\n6.2 Democracy, Partisanship, and Compromise\n\nAll in all, the irony is unmistakable. It seems as though one of the\nmost influential political thinkers of the twentieth century cannot\ncome to clear terms with its zeitgeist in which democracy, in whatever\nform, shape and shade, emerged as the only acceptable ground for\npolitical legitimacy. Weber\u2019s such awkwardness is nowhere more\ncompelling than in his advocacy for \u201cleadership democracy\u201d\n(F\u00fchrerdemokratie) during the constitutional politics of\npost-WWI Germany.\n\nIf the genuine self-rule of the people is impossible, according to his\nunsentimental outlook on democracy, the only choice is one between\nleaderless and leadership democracy. When advocating a sweeping\ndemocratization of defeated Germany, thus, Weber envisioned democracy\nin Germany as a political marketplace in which strong charismatic\nleaders can be identified and elected by winning votes in a free\ncompetition, even battle, among themselves. Preserving and enhancing\nthis element of struggle in politics is important since it is only\nthrough a dynamic electoral process that national leadership strong\nenough to control the otherwise omnipotent bureaucracy can be made.\nThe primary concern for Weber in designing democratic institutions\nhas, in other words, less to do with the realization of democratic\nideals, such as freedom, equality, justice, or self-rule, than with\ncultivation of certain character traits befitting a robust national\nleadership. In its overriding preoccupation with the leadership\nqualities, Weber\u2019s theory of democracy contains ominous streaks\nthat may vindicate J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s infamous dictum that\nCarl Schmitt, \u201cthe Kronjurist of the Third\nReich,\u201d was \u201ca legitimate pupil of Weber\u2019s\u201d\n[Habermas in Stammer (ed.) 1971, 66].\n\nFor a fair and comprehensive assessment, however, it should also be\nbrought into purview that Weber\u2019s leadership democracy is not\nsolely reliant upon the fortuitous personality traits of its leaders,\nlet alone a caesaristic dictator. \u201c[A] genuine charisma is\nradically different from the convenient presentation of the present\n\u2018divine right of king\u2019\u2026 the very opposite is true\nof the genuinely charismatic ruler, who is responsible to the\nruled\u201d [1922/1978, 1114]. Such responsibility is conceivable\nbecause charisma is attributed to a leader through a process that can\nbe described as \u201cimputation\u201d from below [Joose\n2014, 271]. In addition to the free electoral competition led by the\norganized mass parties, Weber saw localized, yet public associational\nlife as a breeding ground for such an imputation of charisma. When\nleaders are identified and selected at the level of, say neighborhood\nchoral societies and bowling clubs [Weber 1910/2002], the alleged\nauthoritarian elitism of leadership democracy comes across as more\npluralistic in its valence, far from its usual identification with\ndemagogic dictatorship and unthinking mass following. Insofar as a\nvibrant civil society functions as an effective medium for the\nhorizontal diffusion of charismatic qualities among lay people, his\nnotion of charismatic leadership can retain a strongly democratic tone\nto the extent that he also suggested associational pluralism as a\nsociocultural ground for the political education of the lay citizenry\nfrom which genuine leaders would hail. Weber\u2019s charismatic\nleadership has to be \u201cdemocratically manufactured\u201d [Green\n2008, 208], in short, and such a formative political project is\npredicated upon a pluralistically organized civil society as well as\nsuch liberal institutions as universal suffrage, free elections, and\norganized parties.\n\nIn this respect, however, it should be noted that Weber\u2019s take\non civil society is crucially different from a\ncommunitarian-Tocquevillean outlook, and this contrast can be cast\ninto sharper relief once put in terms of the contemporary democratic\ntheory of partisanship [cf., inter alia, Rosenblum 2008;\nMuirhead 2014; White and Ypi 2016]. Like the contemporary advocates of\npartisanship, Weber is critical of the conventional communitarian view\nthat simply equates civil society with voluntary associational life\nitself. For not all voluntary associations are conducive to democracy;\nsome are in fact \u201cbad\u201d for its viability. Even in a\n\u201cgood\u201d civil society, those \u201cassociative\npractice,\u201d or Vergesellschaftung in Weber\u2019s\nparlance [Weber 1910/2002], may cultivate the kind of civil\nvirtues that regulate our private lives, but such social capital\ncannot be automatically transferred to the public realm as a useful\nset of civic virtues and skills for democratic politics.\nPolitical capital can be acquired by living political\nexperiences daily. This realization led Weber as well as a growing\nnumber of contemporary democratic theorists to converge on an\ninsistent call for the politicization of civil society in the form of\nnot less, but better partisanship, making his politics of civil\nsociety crucially different from that of a communitarian-Tocquevillean\npersuasion [see Kim in Hanke, Scaff & Whimster (eds.) 2020].\n\nAlso different from this intensely political civil society is a\nliberal-Habermasian \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d a\nrational-communicative haven in which the open exchange and fair\ndeliberation of impartial opinions take place until reasonable\nconsensus emerges. By contrast, Weber\u2019s civil society is to be\nan agonistic arena of organized rivalry, competition, and struggle on\nbehalf of the irreducibly partial claims between which\nconsensus \u2013 be that reasonable, overlapping, or bipartisan\n\u2013 may not always be found. Given the incommensurable value\nfragmentation of the modern politics and society, Weber would\nwholeheartedly embrace the so-called \u201ccircumstances of\npolitics\u201d under which deep disagreements are reasonable\nand permanent, agreeing that it is not necessarily a bad\nthing for democracy as long as those \u201cpermanent\ndisagreements\u201d remain peaceful [Waldron 1999]. From such an\nagonistic perspective, the best that can be expected is some kind of\nmixture of those partial claims \u2013 a compromise wherein\nlies the true meaning of political virtue. That is to say,\nalthough no \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d can be expected, it is\nprecisely because all partisan claims are so partial that a political\ncompromise can be made at least between good partisans. For\nneither too unprincipled (as in opportunistic power-seekers) nor too\nprincipled (as in moral zealots), good partisan citizens welcome a\npolitical compromise, albeit their passionate value convictions,\nbecause they know that some reasonable disagreements are permanent.\nThen, the kind of political capital expected to be accumulated in a\ngood partisan civil society is a mixture of \u201cprinciple and\npragmatism\u201d [Muirhead 2014, 41\u201342] \u2013 a political\nvirtue much akin to Weber\u2019s syncretic ethics of conviction\n(Gesinnungsethik) and responsibility\n(Verantwortungsethik) [see 6.3 below].\n\nTogether, Weber\u2019s ethics also demand that the political leaders\nand public citizenry combine unflinching commitments to higher causes\n(which make them different from mere bureaucratic careerists) with\nsober realism that no political claim, including their own, can\nrepresent the whole truth (which makes them different from moral\npurists and political romantics). This syncretic ethic is the ultimate\nhallmark of those politicians with a sense of vocation who would fight\nfor their convictions with fierce determination yet not without a\n\u201csense of pragmatic judgment\u201d\n(Augenma\u00df)that a compromise is unavoidable between\nincommensurable value positions, and all they can do in the end is to\ntake robust responsibility for the consequences, either intended or\nunintended, of what they thought was a principled compromise.\nThis is why Weber said: \u201cThe politician must make compromises\n\u2026 the scholar may not cover them (Der Politiker\nmu\u00df Kompromisse machen \u2026 der Gelehrte darf sie nicht\ndecken)\u201d [MWG II/10, 983; also see Bruun 1972 (2007, 244)]. It is\nthis type of political virtue that Weber wants to instill at the\ncitizenship as well as leadership level, and the site of this\npolitical education is a pluralistically organized civil society in\nwhich leaders and citizens can experience the dynamic and\ninstitutionalized politicization (re)produced by partisan\npolitics.\n6.3 Conviction and Responsibility\n\nWhat are, then, these two ethics of conviction and responsibility\nexactly that Weber wanted to foster through a\n\u201c\u2018chronic\u2019 political schooling\u201d\n[Weber 1894/1994, 26]. According to the ethic of responsibility, on\nthe one hand, an action is given meaning only as a cause of an effect,\nthat is, only in terms of its causal relationship to the empirical\nworld. The virtue lies in an objective understanding of the possible\ncausal effect of an action and the calculated reorientation of the\nelements of an action in such a way as to achieve a desired\nconsequence. An ethical question is thereby reduced to a question of\ntechnically correct procedure, and free action consists of choosing\nthe correct means. By emphasizing the causality to which a free agent\nsubscribes, in short, Weber prescribes an ethical integrity between\naction and consequences, instead of a Kantian emphasis on that between\naction and intention.\n\nAccording to the ethic of conviction, on the other hand, a free agent\nshould be able to choose autonomously not only the means, but also the\nend; \u201cthis concept of personality finds its\n\u2018essence\u2019 in the constancy of its inner relation to\ncertain ultimate \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018meanings\u2019 of\nlife\u201d [Weber 1903\u201306/1975, 192]. In this respect,\nWeber\u2019s central problem arises from the recognition that the\nkind of rationality applied in choosing a means cannot be used in\nchoosing an end. These two kinds of reasoning represent categorically\ndistinct modes of rationality, a boundary further reinforced by modern\nvalue fragmentation. With no objectively ascertainable ground of\nchoice provided, then, a free agent has to create purpose ex nihilo:\n\u201cultimately life as a whole, if it is not to be permitted to run\non as an event in nature but is instead to be consciously guided, is a\nseries of ultimate decisions through which the soul \u2013 as in\nPlato \u2013 chooses its own fate\u201d [Weber 1917/1949, 18]. This\nultimate decision and the Kantian integrity between intention and\naction constitute the essence of what Weber calls an ethic of\nconviction.\n\nIt is often held that the gulf between these two types of ethics is\nunbridgeable for Weber. Demanding an unmitigated integrity between\none\u2019s ultimate value and political action, that is to say, the\ndeontological ethic of conviction cannot be reconciled with\nthat of responsibility which is consequentialist in essence.\nIn fact, Weber himself admitted the \u201cabysmal contrast\u201d\nthat separates the two. This frank admission, nevertheless, cannot be\ntaken to mean that he privileged the latter over the former as far as\npolitical education is concerned.\n\nWeber keenly recognized the deep tension between consequentialism and\ndeontology, but he still insisted that they should be forcefully\nbrought together. The former recognition only lends urgency to the\nlatter agenda. Resolving this analytical inconsistency in terms of\ncertain \u201cethical decrees\u201d did not interest Weber. Instead,\nhe sought for a moral character that can manage this\n\u201ccombination\u201d with a sheer force of will. In fact, he also\ncalled this synthetic ethic as that of responsibility without clearly\ndistinguishing it from the merely consequentialist ethic it sought to\novercome, thus creating an interpretive debate that continues to this\nday [de Villiers 2018, 47\u201378]. Be that as it may, his advocacy\nfor this willful synthesis is incontrovertible, and he called such an\nethical character a \u201cpolitician with a sense of vocation\u201d\n(Berufspolitiker) who combines a passionate conviction in\nsupra-mundane ideals that politics has to serve and a sober rational\ncalculation of its realizability in this mundane world. Weber thus\nconcluded: \u201cthe ethic of conviction and the ethic of\nresponsibility are not absolute opposites. They are complementary to\none another, and only in combination do they produce the true human\nbeing who is capable of having a \u2018vocation for\npolitics\u2019\u201d [Weber 1919/1994, 368].\n\nThis synthetic political virtue seems not only hard to achieve, but\nalso without a promise of felicitous ending. Weber\u2019s synthesis\ndemands a sober confrontation with the reality of politics, i.e., the\never-presence of \u201cphysical forces\u201d and all the unintended\nconsequences or collateral damages that come with the use of coercion.\nOnly then may it be brought under ethical control by a superhuman\ndeployment of passion and prudence, but, even so, Weber\u2019s\npolitical superhuman (\u00dcbermensch) cannot circumvent the\nso-called \u201cdirty-hands dilemma\u201d [cf. Walzer 1973; Coady\n2009]. For, even at the moment of triumph, the unrelenting grip of\nresponsibility would never let him or her disavow the guilt and\nremorse for having employed the \u201cphysical forces,\u201d no\nmatter how beneficial or necessary. It is a tragic-heroic ethic of\n\u201cnevertheless (dennoch)\u201d [see 2.2] and, as such,\nWeber\u2019s \u201ctragicism\u201d goes beyond politics [Honigsheim\n2013, 115]. Science as a Vocation is a self-evident case in\nwhich the virtue of \u201cvalue freedom\u201d demands a scientist to\nconfront the modern epistemological predicament of incommensurable\nvalue-fragmentation without succumbing to the nihilistic plethora of\nsubjective values by means of a disciplined and willful devotion to\nthe scholarly specialization and scientific objectivity [see 5.2].\nFrom this ethical vintage point, The Protestant Ethic and the\nSpirit of Capitalism may as well be re-titled Labour\nas a Vocation. It was in this much earlier work\n(1904\u20135) that Weber first outlined the basic contours of the\nethic of vocation (Berufsethik) and a person of vocation\n(Berufsmensch) and the way those work practices emerged\nhistorically in the course of the Reformation (and faded away\nsubsequently). The Calvinist doctrine of predestination has amplified\nthe innermost anxiety over one\u2019s own salvation, but such a\nsubjective fear and trembling was channeled into a psychological\nreservoir for the most disciplined and methodical life conduct\n(Lenbensf\u00fchrung), or labour in calling, that created the\n\u201cspirit\u201d of capitalism. Paradoxically combining subjective\nvalue commitments and objective rationality in the pursuit of those\ngoals, in short, the making and unmaking of the Berufsmensch\nis where Weber\u2019s ethical preoccupations in politics, science,\nand economy converge [cf. Hennis 1988].\n\nIn the end, Weber\u2019s project is not about formal analysis of\nmoral maxims, nor is it about substantive virtues that reflect some\nkind of ontic telos. It is too formal or empty to be an Aristotelean\nvirtue ethics, and it is too concerned with moral character to be a\nKantian deontology narrowly understood. The goal of Weber\u2019s\nethical project, rather, aims at cultivating a character who can\nwillfully bring together these conflicting formal virtues to create\nwhat he calls a \u201ctotal personality\u201d\n(Gesamtpers\u00f6nlichkeit). It culminates in an ethical\ncharacterology or philosophical anthropology in which passion and\nreason are properly ordered by sheer force of individual will. As\nsuch, Weber\u2019s political virtue resides not simply in a\nsubjective intensity of value commitment nor in a detached\nintellectual integrity and methodical purposefulness, but in their\nwillful combination in a unified soul. In this abiding preoccupation\nwith statecraft-cum-soulcraft, Weber was a moralist and\npolitical educator who squarely belonged to the venerable tradition\nthat stretches back to the ancient Greeks down to Rousseau, Hegel, and\nMill.\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nSeen this way, we find a remarkable consistency in Weber\u2019s\nthought. Weber\u2019s main problematic turned on the question of\nindividual autonomy and freedom in an increasingly rationalized\nsociety. His dystopian and pessimistic assessment of rationalization\ndrove him to search for solutions through politics and science, which\nbroadly converge on a certain practice of the self. What he\ncalled the \u201cperson of vocation,\u201d first outlined famously\nin The Protestant Ethic, provided a bedrock for his various\nefforts to resuscitate a character who can willfully combine\nunflinching conviction and methodical rationality even in a society\nbesieged by bureaucratic petrification and value fragmentation. It is\nalso in this entrenched preoccupation with an ethical characterology\nunder modern circumstances that we find the source of his enduring\ninfluences on twentieth-century political and social thought.\n\nOn the left, Weber\u2019s articulation of the tension between\nmodernity and modernization found resounding echoes in the\n\u201cDialectics of Enlightenment\u201d thesis by Theodor Adorno and\nMax Horkheimer; Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s own critique of the perversion\nof capitalist reason owes no less to Weber\u2019s problematization of\ninstrumental rationality on which is also built Habermas\u2019s\nelaboration of communicative rationality as an alternative. Different\nelements in Weber\u2019s political thought, e.g., intense political\nstruggle as an antidote to modern bureaucratic petrification,\nleadership democracy and plebiscitary presidency, stark realist\noutlook on democracy and power-politics, and value-freedom and\nvalue-relativism in political ethics, were selected and critically\nappropriated by such diverse thinkers on the right as Carl Schmitt,\nJoseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron.\nEven the postmodernist project of deconstructing the Enlightenment\nsubjectivity finds, as Michel Foucault does, a precursor in Weber. All\nin all, across the vastly different ideological and methodological\nspectrum, Max Weber\u2019s thought will continue to be a deep\nreservoir of fresh inspiration as long as an individual\u2019s fate\nunder (post)modern circumstances does not lose its privileged place in\nthe political, social, cultural, and philosophical reflections of our\ntime.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<p>\nCommissioned by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (<em>Bayerische</em>\n<em>Akademie der Wissenschaften</em>), <em>Max Weber\nGesamtausgabe</em> (Collected Works) have been published continuously\nsince 1984 by J.

C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), the original publisher of\nWeber\u2019s works in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. The first editorial\ncommittee of 1973 consisted of Horst Baier, M. Rainer Lepsius,\nWolfgang Mommsen, Wolfgang Schluchter, and Johannes Winkelmann. This\nmonumental project consists of a total of forty-five (plus two index)\nvolumes in three divisions, i.e., I. Writings and Speeches, II.\nCorrespondences, and III. Lectures and Lecture Notes. In 2020, it was\nfinally brought to a completion in time for the centenary of\nWeber\u2019s death. The original commissioner, the Bavarian Academy,\nhas begun to go on-line with an open-access digital format; for\nupdates, the reader is referred to the publisher\u2019s web page for\nthe\n <a href=\"https://mwg-digital.badw.de\" target=\"other\"><em>Max Weber Gesamtausgabe</em> (digital)</a>.</p>\n<h4>Primary Texts in English Translation</h4>\n<p>\nIn English, new translations have appeared since the turn of the\ncentury. Most notable among them would be <em>The Protestant Ethic and\nthe Spirit of Capitalism</em> by Peter Baehr/Gordon C. Wells (Penguin\nBooks, 2002) and Stephen Kalberg (Roxbury Publishing Co., 2002).\nReflecting the latest Weber scholarship, both editions have many\nvirtues, especially in terms of enhanced readability and adequate\ncontextualization. Talcott Parson\u2019s classic edition is still\nlisted below because it is the most widely available text in English.\nEven more welcoming is the new compilation and translation of\nWeber\u2019s methodological writings in <em>Max Weber: Collected\nMethodological Writings</em> (eds. Hans Henrik Bruun and Sam\nWhimster, trans. Hans Henrik Bruun, Routlege, 2012). The earlier\nanthology, for all its uneven quality of translation, is still used in\nthis article for the same reason of availability.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Weber, Max. 1895/1994. \u201cThe Nations State and Economic\nPolicy (Freiburg Address)\u201d in <em>Weber: Political\nWritings</em>, P.
