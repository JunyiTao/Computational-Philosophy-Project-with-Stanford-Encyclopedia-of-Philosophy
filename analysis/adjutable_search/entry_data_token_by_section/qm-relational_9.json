    "main_text": "General Comments || Realism and Relationality\n3.2 Reactions and criticisms\n\nIn van Fraassen (2010), Bas van Fraassen explores \u201cthe world of\nquantum mechanics as RQM depicts it\u201d (2010: 390), clarifying\nwhat is and what is not relative to observers. He concentrates on the\napparently paradoxical aspects of RQM. The limits on information that\nobservers can have, which can only be acquired through physical\ninteraction, have surprising consequences for complex situations in\nwhich an observer makes a measurement, a second observer makes\nmeasurements on the first and its target, and even a third observer\ncomes in and observes a process involving the first two observers. Van\nFraassen concludes that all the consistency questions can be laid to\nrest, when the situation\u2019s representation in RQM is properly\nunderstood. On the other hand, he also observes that if in RQM what\nthe state of a system relative to an observer is, is not itself\nrelative to anything, then the question can be raised what\nrelationships there are between the state of a specific entangled\nsystem or its components relative to different observers. He proposes\nand additional postulate, weakly relating the description of the same\nsystem as given by different observers, which forbids the possibility\nof disturbing inconsistencies allowed by the multiplication of\nperspectives.\n\nLaura Candiotto (2017) argues that the best philosophical framework\nfor RQM is Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) (Ladyman& Ross 2007;\nFrench & Ladyman 2011). Ontic structural realism is meant to be a\ndefensible form of scientific realism (Ladyman 2007 [2019]); it argues\nfor the priority of relations over substances, as self-subsistent\nindividual objects (Morganti 2011). For Candiotto, RQM is a realistic\ntheory that assumes the notion of relation (the physical interaction\nbetween systems and instruments) as primitive; objects emerge as\nrelational \u201cnodes\u201d (French 2006), or intersections of\nprocesses. The lack of observer-independence is not inability of\nproviding an account of the structure of matter, because there are no\nintrinsic properties that can be assigned to systems independently of\ntheir interactions, therefore this structure is itself relational,\nhence in particular observer dependent. Relations via dynamical\nprocesses of information exchange can be taken as the building blocks\nof the universe.\n\nThe relation between RQM and ontic structural realism has been\nemphasized also by Mauro Dorato (2016). Dorato gives an extensive\nevaluation of RQM, pointing out its main characteristics. He\nemphasises then two aspects that characterise RQM. The first is a\nrevisionary rather than a descriptive metaphysical account of quantum\ntheory; that is: central assumptions of common sense must go, if they\ncontradict contemporary physical theories. Here, what is abandoned is\nthe presupposition that quantum systems have a non-relational,\nintrinsic nature. RQM\u2019s metaphysics is revisionary also for a\nsecond reason. Analogously to the many-worlds interpretation, RQM does\nnot suggest changing the formalism of quantum theory\u2014as\nalternative formulations of the theory do\u2014but rather, modifies\nthe conceptual schemes with which we can interpret the formalism, and\nconsequently, our metaphysics. Dorato observes that the relativisation\nof values implies a relativisation of the very notion of object or\nentity, if (i) having some intrinsic, non-purely dispositional\nproperties is essential to the identity of an object, and (ii) no\nentity can exist if it does not have an intrinsic identity (see\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna c. 2nd century CE [1995]). The only reality in RQM\nis given by events, which are the result of interactions between\ndistinct quantum systems, but even these events can be described in a\ndifferent way by different physical systems. The interaction cannot be\ndescribed in a more precise way by a constructive theory in\nEinstein\u2019s sense (Einstein 1919) that can explain the coming\ninto being of a definite outcome without just assuming it as a\nfundamental fact. Dorato concludes that there is no measurement\nproblem in RQM because RQM is implicitly formulated as a theory of\nprinciple. He also considers the issue of priority monism as defined\nin Schaffer (2010): Shaffer claims that quantum mechanics\u2019\nentanglement is evidence that the whole universe has ontological\npriority with respect to its parts. Dorato point out that the firm\nadvocacy of relationalism of RQM has instead radical anti-holistic\nconsequences.\n\nThe second characteristic aspect of RQM pointed out by Dorato is that,\nconsequently, the best way to capture the nature of not-yet\ninteracting quantum systems is to call into play a form of\ndispositionalism: the only way to attribute some sort of intrinsicness\nto the state-dependent properties of quantum systems is to attribute\nthem dispositions to manifest in a certain way according to the\ninteractions they are subject to. Dispositionalism is present in many\nother views of quantum mechanics (Dorato 2006) but fits particularly\nwell in the context of RQM. Unlike Qbists interpretations of quantum\ntheory, which are agents-centered, in RQM the relation \u201c\\(S\\)\nmanifest \\(q\\) relative to \\(S'\\)\u201d is symmetric, and this is a\nsimple consequence of the hypothesis that in RQM quantum systems and\n\u201cobservers\u201d are on the same level. As a consequence of its\nrelational and dispositional aspect, Dorato stresses the fact that in\nRQM there cannot be a universal flow of becoming, but only a local,\nworldline-dependent and relational one. This still counts as a\nrelational form of becoming: no universal tide of coming into being,\nbut a crisscross of ripples. Since a physical system can exemplify a\ngiven succession of events only relatively to another system and not\nabsolutely, in RQM there cannot be cosmic time, so that also in\ngeneral relativity temporal succession of events cannot be regarded as\na total order. In a sense, in RQM there is no quantum state of the\nuniverse, or a God\u2019s eye point of view, since the cosmos can\nonly be described \u201cfrom within a given perspective\u201d.\n",
