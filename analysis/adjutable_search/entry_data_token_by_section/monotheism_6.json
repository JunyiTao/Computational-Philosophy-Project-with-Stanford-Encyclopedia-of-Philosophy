    "main_text": "An Argument from the Demand for Total Devotion\n6. An Argument from the Demand for Total Devotion\n\n\nAccording to William of Ockham, \u201cGod\u201d can be understood\nin two ways. By \u201cGod\u201d one may mean \u201csomething more\nnoble and more perfect than anything else besides him,\u201d or one\nmight mean \u201cthat than which nothing is more noble and more\nperfect.\u201d If God is understood in the first way, then there can\nbe only one god. For consider the following argument:\n\nNecessarily, if any being is God, it is more perfect than any other\nbeing.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two distinct beings and each were God,\nthe first would be more perfect than the second and the second would be\nmore perfect than the first. (From 1.)\n\n\n\nBut\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two beings each of which is more\nperfect than the other.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 2 and 3.)\n\n\n\nBut if God is understood in the second way, Ockham thinks that it\ncannot be shown that there is only one god. For it isn\u2019t clear that\nthere couldn\u2019t be two equally perfect beings, each of whom was such\nthat no actual or possible being surpassed it (Ockham, 139\u201340).\n\n\nEven if Ockham is right about this, it does seem impossible that\nthere be two gods. For it appears to be a conceptual truth\nthat God is unsurpassable. If he is, then, if there were two gods each\nwould be unsurpassable. But there can\u2019t be two unsurpassable beings\neach of which is God. For part of what it means to call\nsomething \u201cGod\u201d is that it is an appropriate object of\ntotal devotion and unconditional commitment. If there were two\nunsurpassable beings, however, our devotion and commitment should be\ndivided between them. (As Scotus says, if there were two infinite\ngoods, \u201can orderly will \u2026 could not be perfectly satisfied\nwith but one infinite good\u201d [Scotus, 87].) Since they are equally\nperfect, it would be inappropriate to be totally devoted or\nunconditionally committed to either one of them. But if it\nwould, then neither of them would be God. So if it is a conceptual\ntruth that God is unsurpassable, he must be unique.\n\n\nAn appeal to unsurpassability isn\u2019t really necessary, however, since\nGod\u2019s uniqueness follows directly from his being an appropriate object\nof total devotion and unconditional commitment. For consider the\nfollowing argument:\n\nGod is, by definition, a being worthy of worship (that is, of total\ndevotion and unconditional commitment).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods, there would be two beings each\nof which was worthy of worship. (From 5.)\n\n\n\nIf so, then\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods both of them ought to\nbe worshiped. (From 6. Cf. the inference from \u201cx is\nworthy of admiration\u201d to \u201ceveryone ought to admire\nx.\u201d)\n\n\n\nBut\n\nNecessarily, if we ought to worship both of these gods, then we\ncan worship both of them. (\u201cOught\u201d implies\n\u201ccan;\u201d we are only obligated to do what we are able to\ndo.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods, we could be totally devoted\nand unconditionally committed to the first, and totally devoted and\nunconditionally committed to the second. (From 7, 8, and the definition\nof \u201cworship.\u201d)\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\nIt is impossible to be totally devoted and unconditionally\ncommitted to each of two distinct beings.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 9 and 10.)\n\n\n\nThere are at least two possible problems with this argument,\nhowever. First, the inference from 6 to 7 might seem suspect. For if\n\u201cought\u201d does imply \u201ccan,\u201d and it\nis impossible to be totally devoted and unconditionally\ncommitted to each of two distinct beings (as 10 says), then we aren\u2019t\nunder any obligation to do so. The truth of 10 implies the falsity of\n7.\n\n\nMatters aren\u2019t so simple, however. \u201cI ought to return John\u2019s\ngun\u201d (since I promised to return it) and \u201cI ought not to\nreturn John\u2019s gun\u201d (since he is no longer in his right mind) do\nnot entail \u201cI can both return the gun and not return it.\u201d\nSo why think that if I ought to worship the first god and I ought to\nworship the second, I ought to worship both of them? Because the two\ncases are dissimilar. In the first, neither obligation is indefeasible;\neach can, in principle, be trumped by other stronger obligations. While\nI indeed have prima facie obligations both to return the gun and to not\nreturn it, the only actual obligation I have in the\ncircumstances that were described is the obligation to not return the\ngun. Because \u201cI ought to return the gun and I ought not to return\nthe gun (that is, I have a prima facie obligation to return it and a\nprima facie obligation to not return it)\u201d does not entail\n\u201cI have an actual obligation both to return and to not return the\ngun,\u201d there is no reason to infer that I can do both. By\ncontrast, both of the obligations referred to in 7 are indefeasible.\n(Their indefeasibility appears to be part of the very concept of divine\nworship; part of what it means to be God is to be such that no other\nobligation can take precedence over our obligation to be totally\ndevoted and unconditionally committed to him.) Both are therefore\nactual, and not merely prima facie, obligations. Now even though one\ncan have a prima facie obligation to do something one is unable to do,\nit is doubtful that one can have an actual obligation to do\nsomething one can\u2019t do. That I am obligated to worship both deities\nthus seems to entail that I can worship both deities. The inference\nfrom 6 to 7 seems sound.\n\n\nAnother possible problem concerns the truth of 10. Thus, Thomas\nMorris has objected that one could be unconditionally committed to each\nof two distinct beings provided that their wills were necessarily\nharmonious. For if their wills were necessarily harmonious,\nthey could not require of us conflicting acts. This objection should be\ndiscounted, however, because the wills of distinct persons are\nnecessarily opposable. (See discussion in section 5 above.)\n\n\nIt is perhaps less obvious why devotion can\u2019t be divided\nbetween two beings. But the best answer is probably this. The sort of\ndevotion appropriate to God involves centering one\u2019s life in God, and\nwhile one can center one\u2019s life in x-and-y, one can\u2019t center one\u2019s life\nin x and also center one\u2019s life in y. The devotion that God\nrequires appears, then, to be inherently indivisible.\n\n\nIn sum, neither of the two problems presents an unsurmountable\ndifficulty for the argument from total devotion.\n",
