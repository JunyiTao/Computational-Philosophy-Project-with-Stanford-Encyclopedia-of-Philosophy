    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || The will and its relation to the intellect\n5.3 The will and its relation to the intellect\n\n\nTachau (2013: 82) writes that on Leff\u2019s interpretation,\nFitzRalph reached for a moderate if not mediocre position, rejecting\nboth Aquinas\u2019s \u201cdoctrine\u201d of the intellect\u2019s\nsuperiority and Scotus\u2019s decision in favor of the will\u2019s\n\u201cprimacy,\u201d instead \u201ccontrapos[ing] his own opinio\nmedia\u201d(Leff 1963: 97). On the issue of which of the two\nmental faculties, will or intellect, is superior, Scotus\u2019s\n\u201cview of the will as a power superior to the intellect \u2026\nappealed to FitzRalph personally,\u201d in Walsh\u2019s judgment, but\nhe deemed Aquinas\u2019s support for the opposite ranking \u201cmore\nauthoritative.\u201d Walsh gained the impression that\nFitzRalph\u2019s position was somehow untenable, so much so that\n\u201cWodeham took him to task for trying to have things both\nways\u201d (Walsh 1981: 60).\n\n\nTachau (2013: 85) points out that what Wodeham actually says is that\n\u201cthe will truly is not nobler than the intellect nor\nvice versa, and note that Fitzralph holds the\nsame\u201d. FitzRalph recognized that the various distinctions\n(real, formal, intentional, or of reason) that previous scholastic\ngenerations had drawn among the intellective and sensitive substances\nof the soul, or its \u201cfaculties,\u201d or the faculties\u2019\ndiverse acts and habits, were problematic; yet, he also pointed to\nsignificant philosophical and theological impediments that would arise\nfrom denying all distinctions, obstacles that neither he nor\nhis contemporaries had entirely satisfactory means of eluding (Tachau\n2013: 92). So if there were no distinction whatsoever between the\nintellectual soul\u2019s faculties of will and intellect, then\npresumably a cognition of any given object, as an act of the intellect,\nwould be identical to the will\u2019s volition regarding the same\nobject. To accept this conclusion, however, would introduce\nnumerous complications into any theory of whether and how God reveals\nfuture contingents, and lead to untenable consequences (Tachau 2013:\n93). \n5.4. God as the Agent Intellect\n\n\nIn the Lectura there are a series of articles which deal with\nmatters closely related to the question on the human mind as an image\nof the Trinity but which clearly were not integrated when FitzRalph\npresumably abandoned the editing process when he became Chancellor of\nOxford University.  These articles are of interest in their own right\nsince in them we see FitzRalph engaged in a long debate with both\ncertain quodlibets of Henry of Ghent and the Commentary on the De\nAnima of Averroes.  One of these articles is entitled \u201cWhether\nthe Agent Intellect is a certain part of the Image\u201d.  Somewhat\nunexpectedly, at the end of the article FitzRalph, in a way\nreminiscent of Bonaventure, asserts that the Agent Intellect is God,\nor that the Agent Intellect is not a certain part of the image but is\nthe First Form or God.  This seems to place FitzRalph in an earlier\ntradition, going back even to William of Auvergne and Robert\nGrosseteste and a return to an earlier Augustinianism.\n",
