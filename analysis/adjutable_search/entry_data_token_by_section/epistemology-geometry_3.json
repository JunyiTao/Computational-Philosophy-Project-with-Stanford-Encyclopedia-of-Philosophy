Epistemological issues in applied geometry\n\nIt is a useful over-simplification to say that around 1800 the view\nwas that there is one physical space, and that this space is described\nby the geometry in Euclid\u2019s Elements, which is the only\ncandidate for such a task. Disputes concerned the rigorous\npresentation of this geometry and the limits of its application to the\nphysical world. The nature of the knowledge that geometry provided was\nalso a matter of some discussion.\n\nTraditionally, geometry had been regarded as a paradigm of truth,\ncertainty, and justification. This can be found e.g. in many authors\nof the seventeenth century. Descartes was ready to criticize the\nEuclidian method for a certain stiffness, which made it difficult to\nfind the solution of new problems, and he sought to alleviate it by\ncombining algebra and geometry; yet, even so, he always emphasized the\nclarity and evidence of geometry and its demonstrations. According to\nPascal, geometry was the perfect illustration of the methods of\ndemonstrating truths, and of establishing a body of propositions in\nmethodical order. Leibniz, Spinoza, and others, continued taking\nmathematics as a model for philosohical discourse.\n\nLocke (see the entry on\n Locke)\n took from the Aristotelian tradition the idea that Euclidean geometry\nand rational theology are the exemplars of scientific knowledge, but\nsought to ground his philosophy in intuitive, demonstrative, and\nsensitive kinds of knowledge. Intuitive knowledge is what is grasped\nimmediately; demonstrative knowledge avails itself of the intermediate\nsteps of a proof, as in geometry. Both these forms of knowledge are\ncertain. Sensitive knowledge is not certain: it is what we learn\nthrough our senses, it presents effects but not causes, it is at best\npartial and may be deceptive. Space can be thought of as composed of\nall (actual and possible) positions of objects; pure space is space\nwith all solid bodies removed, and distance the primitive concept we\nuse to discuss the separation between bodies.\n\nLocke offered arguments against innatist interpretations of our\nknowledge of space and figures, emphasizing the primary role of\nexperience (see the entry on Molyneux problem). Yet in his An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) Locke asserted\nthat\n\n\n\u2026the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily carries with it\nan equality of its angles to two right ones. Nor can we conceive this\nrelation, this connexion of these two ideas, to be possibly mutable,\nor to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of choice made it thus, or\ncould make it otherwise. (Essay IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560)\n\n\nSensitive knowledge of the corresponding objects, however, could never\nhave this degree of certainty, and because our knowledge derives from\nour knowledge of objects it would seem that scientific knowledge of\nspace is of a different kind from our knowledge of geometry. Thus, for\nLocke, Euclidean geometry provided one kind of knowledge, and\nexperience and scientific experiment, another. Indeed, one might say\nthat an epistemological gap remains to this day in philosophy in the\nform of a distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge that is\nstill widely recognised.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) (see the\nentry\n Kant\u2019s views on space and time)\n the situation is more complicated or sophisticated. Kant introduced\nthe notion of a priori knowledge in contrast to a posteriori, and\nsynthetic knowledge in contrast to analytical knowledge to allow for\nthe existence of knowledge that did not rely on experience (and was\nthus a priori) but was not tautological in character (and therefore\nsynthetic and not analytic). The\ncontentious class of synthetic a priori statements includes the truths\nof Euclidean geometry; thus he ascribed certainty and necessity to\nEuclidean geometry. Kant associated geometric knowledge with the pure\nintution of space; to know that an isosceles triangle (i.e. with two\nequal sides) has two equal angles at the base, the mathematician must\nproduce a particular construction that makes the truth of the claim\ndemonstrable (see Critique, A 716, B 744).\n\nAmong the French philosophes, the dominant position in the 1740s was\nthe Cartesian one, which, as exemplified by Clairaut\u2019s\n\u00c9l\u00e9mens de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1741) was\nperhaps unduly na\u00efve in its insistence on clear and immediate\nideas. The position of d\u2019Alembert, in his articles in the\nEncylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique (1784), was more\nsophisticated. The objects of geometry are to be understood by\nabstracting from bodies every quality except that of being divisible\nand figured extents. Among these objects are lines, that lack breadth,\nand surfaces, that lack depth. Truths established about the objects of\ngeometry are purely abstract and hypothetical, because there is no\nsuch thing, for example, as a perfect circle. The demonstrated\nproperties can hold of actual circles only insofar as the actual\nobject approaches the state of being a perfect circle,\n\n\nThey are, in some sense, a limit and, if one can put it this way, the\nasymptote of physical truths, the term for those objects that approach\nas closely as one wishes without ever arriving at it exactly. (see\nEncylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique II, 132)\n\n\nHowever, if mathematical theorems do not exactly hold in nature, these\ntheorems serve with more than sufficient precision in practice. To be\ndemonstrated with complete rigour they must be considered as holding\nof bodies in a state of abstract perfection that they do not really\nhave.\n\n\nThe curves studied in geometry are not perfectly straight nor\nperfectly curved, the surfaces are not perfectly flat nor perfectly\ncurved, but the more nearly they are so, the more they approach the\nstate of having those properties that one proves about lines exactly\nstraight or curved, and of surfaces exactly flat or curved.\n\n\nThese reflexions, d\u2019Alembert continued, will be enough to refute\nthe sceptics, who complain that geometrical objects do not really\nexist, and others ignorant of mathematics who regard it as a useless\ngame.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that philosophers found no problems in\nEuclid\u2019s Elements, but Hume, d\u2019Alembert, and\nothers of an empiricist persuasion qualified the applicability of the\ntheorems on the grounds that the objects of geometry might have no\ncorresponding objects in the world. Philosophers more open to the idea\nof a wide range of certain knowledge (as, for example, Kant) could\ngrant geometrical theorems the status of a priori truths that cannot\nbe other than they are.\n",
