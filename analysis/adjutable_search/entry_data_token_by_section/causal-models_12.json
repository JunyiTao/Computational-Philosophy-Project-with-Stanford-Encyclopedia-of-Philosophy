    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions\n4.3 The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions\n\nThe MC states a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition for\nconditional probabilistic independence. As such, the MC by itself can\nnever entail that two variables are conditionally or unconditionally\ndependent. The Minimality and Faithfulness Conditions are two\nconditions that give necessary conditions for probabilistic\nindependence. (This is employing the terminology of Spirtes et\nal. (SGS 2000). Pearl (2009) contains a \u201cMinimality\nCondition\u201d that is slightly different from the one described\nhere.)\n\n(i) The Minimality Condition. Suppose that the DAG \\(\\bG\\) on\nvariable set \\(\\bV\\) satisfies MC with respect to the probability\ndistribution P. The Minimality Condition asserts that no sub-graph of\n\\(\\bG\\) over \\(\\bV\\) also satisfies the Markov Condition with respect\nto P. As an illustration, consider the variable set \\(\\{X, Y\\}\\), let\nthere be an arrow from X to Y, and suppose that X\nand Y are probabilistically independent of each other. This\ngraph would satisfy the MC with respect to P: none of the independence\nrelations mandated by the MC are absent (in fact, the MC mandates no\nindependence relations). But this graph would violate the Minimality\nCondition with respect to P, since the subgraph that omits the arrow\nfrom X to Y would also satisfy the MC. The Minimality\nCondition implies that if there is an arrow from X to Y,\nthen X makes a probabilistic difference for Y,\nconditional on the other parents of Y. In other words, if \\(\\bZ\n= \\bPA(Y) \\setminus \\{X\\}\\), there exist \\(\\bz\\), y, x,\n\\(x'\\) such that \\(\\Pr(Y = y \\mid X = x \\amp \\bZ = \\bz) \\ne \\Pr(Y = y\n\\mid X = x' \\amp \\bZ = \\bz)\\).\n\n(ii) The Faithfulness Condition. The Faithfulness Condition\n(FC) is the converse of the Markov Condition: it says that all of the\n(conditional and unconditional) probabilistic independencies that\nexist among the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are required by the MC.\nFor example, suppose that \\(\\bV = \\{X, Y, Z\\}\\). Suppose also that\nX and Z are unconditionally independent of one another,\nbut dependent, conditional upon Y. (The other two variable\npairs are dependent, both conditionally and unconditionally.) The\ngraph shown in\n Figure 8\n does not satisfy FC with respect to this distribution (colloquially,\nthe graph is not faithful to the distribution). MC, when applied to\nthe graph of Figure 8, does not imply the independence of X and\nZ. This can be seen by noting that X and Z are\nd-connected (by the empty set): neither the path \\(X\n\\rightarrow Z\\) nor \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\) is blocked (by\nthe empty set). By contrast, the graph shown in\n Figure 7\n above is faithful to the described distribution. Note that Figure 8\ndoes satisfy the Minimality Condition with respect to the\ndistribution; no subgraph satisfies MC with respect to the described\ndistribution. In fact, FC is strictly stronger than the Minimality\nCondition.\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nHere are some other examples: In\n Figure 6\n above, there is a path \\(W\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow Y\\); FC implies\nthat W and Y should be probabilistically dependent. In\n Figure 7,\n FC implies that X and Z should be dependent,\nconditional on Y.\n\nFC can fail if the probabilistic parameters in a causal model are just\nso. In\n Figure 8,\n for example, X influences Z along two different\ndirected paths. If the effect of one path is to exactly undo the\ninfluence along the other path, then X and Z will be\nprobabilistically independent. If the underlying SEM is linear,\nSpirtes et al. (SGS 2000: Theorem 3.2) prove that the set of\nparameters for which Faithfulness is violated has Lebesgue measure 0.\nNonetheless, parameter values leading to violations of FC are\npossible, so FC does not seem plausible as a metaphysical or\nconceptual constraint upon the connection between causation and\nprobabilities. It is, rather, a methodological principle:\nGiven a distribution on \\(\\{X, Y, Z\\}\\) in which X and Z\nare independent, we should prefer the causal structure depicted in\n Figure 7\n to the one in Figure 8. This is not because Figure 8 is conclusively\nruled out by the distribution, but rather because it is preferable to\npostulate a causal structure that implies the independence of\nX and Z rather than one that is merely\nconsistent with independence. See Zhang and Spirtes 2016 for\ncomprehensive discussion of the role of FC.\n\nViolations of FC are often detectable in principle. For example,\nsuppose that the true causal structure is that shown in\n Figure 7,\n and that the probability distribution over X, Y, and\nZ exhibits all of the conditional independence relations\nrequired by MC. Suppose, moreover, that X and Z are\nindependent, conditional upon Y. This conditional independence\nrelation is not entailed by MC, so it constitutes a violation of FC.\nIt turns out that there is no DAG that is faithful to this probability\ndistribution. This tips us off that there is a violation of FC. While\nwe will not be able to infer the correct causal structure, we will at\nleast avoid inferring an incorrect one in this case. For details, see\nSteel 2006, Zhang & Spirtes 2008, and Zhang 2013b.\n\nResearchers have explored the consequences of adopting a variety of\nassumptions that are weaker than FC; see for example Ramsey et al.\n2006, Spirtes & Zhang 2014, and Zhalama et al. 2016.\n",
