    "main_text": "Group Testimony\n7. The Nature of Testimony Itself\n\nUntil now we have been operating with an intuitive but inexact notion\nof what counts as testimony, i.e., for the most part, we have just\nbeen looking at cases in which speakers say stuff. But how exactly\nshould the speech act of testimony be understood? That is, how should\ntestimony be individuated from the other things that one can do with\ntheir words?\n\nOne answer is that testimony should simply be identified with\nassertion, i.e., one testifies that p if, and only if, one\nasserts that p. (E. Fricker 1987 and Sosa (1994) offer passing\nremarks in defense of this position). But while it is widely accepted\nthat one must assert that p in order to testify that p,\nthere is much debate about whether asserting that p is\nsufficient for testifying that p. (See Goldberg 2010b, though,\nwho argues that asserting that p is not even necessary for\ntestifying that p, and see the entry on Assertion for more\nabout how this speech act should be understood).\n\nFor instance, in addition to asserting that p, one influential\naccount maintains that in order to testify that p, the\nfollowing conditions must also be met:\n\n\nTestimony: S testifies by making some statement that p\nif and only if:\n\n(T1)\nS\u2019s stating that p is evidence that p\nand is offered as evidence that p.\n(T2)\nS has the relevant competence, authority, or credentials to\nstate truly that p.\n(T3)\nS\u2019s statement that p is relevant to some\ndisputed or unresolved question (which may or may not be whether\np) and is directed to those who are in need of evidence on the\nmatter. (Coady 1992: 42).\n\n\n\nHowever, opponents have objected to each of T1\u2013T3. Here is just\none example. Some have rejected T1 on the grounds that one can testify\nthat p even though the testimony itself does not provide the\nhearer with any evidence that p is true, e.g., if I tell you\nthat humans spontaneously combust all the time, and insofar as you\nknow that I am wildly unreliable about this issue, it seems like I\nhave testified to you even though my testimony provides no evidence\nwhatsoever for the proposition in question. (See E. Fricker (1995) and\nLackey (2008). See Lackey (2008: Ch. 1) for a discussion of other\nproblems with this view).\n\nIn light of worries like these, many authors have offered alternative\ntakes on how testimony should be characterized. For instance, E.\nFricker (1995: 396\u20137) argues that testimony should just be\nunderstood in a very general sense, with \u201cno restrictions either\non the subject matter, or on the speaker\u2019s epistemic relation to\nit.\u201d (See also Audi (1997) and Sosa (1991) for views in this\nballpark). And, as we saw in\n Section 3.2.1,\n proponents of the Assurance View understand testimony in terms of\nTelling.\n\nGraham (1997: 227) offers a different account of testimony based on\nconveying information, i.e., a speaker, S, testifies that\np if, and only if, (i) S\u2019s stating that p\nis offered as evidence that p (ii) S intends that his\naudience believe that he has the relevant competence, authority, or\ncredentials to state truly that p and (iii) S\u2019s\nstatement that p is believed by S to be relevant to some\nquestion that he believes is disputed or unresolved (which may or may\nnot be whether p) and is directed at those whom he believes to\nbe in need of evidence on the matter. (J. Ross 1975 and Elgin (2002)\nalso offer accounts that crucially hinge on the speaker\u2019s\nstatement purporting to convey information).\n\nAnd Lackey (2008: 30\u201332) offers a disjunctive account of\ntestimony according to which we need to distinguish between\nspeaker testimony and hearer testimony as\nfollows.\n\n\nSpeaker Testimony: S s-testifies that p by\nperforming an act of communication a if and only if, in\nperforming a, S reasonably intends to convey the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\nHearer Testimony: S h-testifies that p by\nmaking an act of communication a if and only if H,\nS\u2019s hearer, reasonably takes a as conveying the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\n\nOne upshot of this disjunctive account is that it captures the sense\nin which testimony is often an intentional act performed by the\nspeaker, as well as the sense in which testimony is a source of\nknowledge and justified belief regardless of what the speaker intended\nto say.\n\nRegardless of how testimony itself should be understood, all of these\nauthors agree that it is possible to learn from the testimony of\nothers. As we have seen, though, explaining how it is that we can\nlearn from what other people tell us has proven to be a difficult\ntask.\n",
