The dispute\nbetween al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee and Avicenna is not about causality as\nsuch, rather about the necessary nature of God\u2019s creation.\nKukkonen (2000) and Dutton (2001) have shown that the two start with\nquite different assumptions about necessity. Avicenna\u2019s view of\nthe modalities follows the statistical model of Aristotle and connects\nthe possibility of a thing to its temporal actuality (B\u00e4ck 1992).\nA temporally unqualified sentence like, \u201cFire causes cotton to\ncombust,\u201d contains implicitly or explicitly a reference to the\ntime of utterance as part of its meaning. If this sentence is true\nwhenever uttered, it is necessarily true. If its truth-value can\nchange in the course of time, it is possible. If such a sentence is\nfalse whenever uttered, it is impossible (Hintikka 1973, 63\u201372,\n84\u20136, 103\u20135, 149\u201353). In Aristotelian modal\ntheories, modal terms were taken to refer to the one and only\nhistorical world of ours. For Avicenna, fire necessarily causes cotton\nto combust because the sentence \u201cFire causes cotton to\ncombust,\u201d was, is, and will always be true.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s understanding of the modalities\ndeveloped in the context of Ash\u2019arite kal\u00e2m and\ndoes not share the statistical model of Aristotle and Avicenna.\nAsh\u2019arite kal\u00e2m developed an understanding that\nis closer to our modern view of the modalities as referring to\nsynchronic alternative states of affairs. In the modern model, the\nnotion of necessity refers to what obtains in all alternatives, the\nnotion of possibility refers to what obtains in at least in one\nalternative, and that which is impossible does not obtain in any\nconceivable state of affairs (Knuuttila 1998, 145). Ash\u2019arite\nkal\u00e2m pursued the notion that God is the\nparticularizing agent (mukhassis) of all events in the world,\nwho determines, for instance, when things come into existence and when\nthey fall out of existence (Davidson 1987, 159\u201361,\n176\u201380). The idea of particularization (takhs\u00ees)\nincludes implicitly an understanding of possible worlds that are\ndifferent from this. The process of particularization makes one of\nseveral alternatives actual. In his Creed for Niz\u00e2m\nal-Mulk, al-Juwayn\u00ee explains the Ash\u2019arite\nunderstanding of the modalities. Every sound thinking person finds\nwithin herself, \u201cthe knowledge about the possibility of what is\npossible, the necessity of what is necessary, and the impossibility of\nwhat is impossible\u201d (al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948, 8\u20139). We know\nthis distinction instinctively without learning it from others and\nwithout further inquiry into the world. It is an impulse\n(bad\u00eeha) in our rational judgment\n(\u2018aql). Al-Juwayn\u00ee explains this impulse:\n\nThe impulsive possibility that the intellect rushes to apprehend\nwithout [any] consideration, thinking, or inquiry is what becomes\nevident to the intelligent person when he sees a building. [The\nbuilding] is a possibility that comes into being (min jaw\u00e2z\nhud\u00fbthihi). The person knows decisively and offhand that\nthe actual state (hud\u00fbth) of that building is from\namong its possible states (ja\u2019iz\u00e2t) and that it\nis not impossible in the intellect had it not been built.\n(al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948, 9)\n\n\nThe intelligent person (al-\u2018\u00e2qil)\u2014here\nsimply meaning a person with full rational capacity\u2014realizes\nthat all the features of the building, its height, its length, its\nform, etc., are actualized possibilities and could be different. The\nsame applies to the time when the building is built. We immediately\nrealize, al-Juwayn\u00ee says, that there is a synchronic alternative\nstate to the actual building. This is what we call possibility or more\nprecisely contingency (imk\u00e2n). Realizing that there is\nsuch an alternative is an important part of our understanding:\n\u201cThe intelligent person cannot realize in his mind anything\nabout the states of the building without comparing it with what is\ncontingent like it (imk\u00e2n mithlihi) or what is\ndifferent from it (khil\u00e2fihi).\u201d (al-Juwayn\u00ee\n1948,9.)\n\nIn at least three passages of the Incoherence\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee criticizes Avicenna\u2019s understanding of\nthe modalities. Here he refers to another, closely related dispute,\nnamely that for Avicenna the modalities exist in reality while for\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee they exist only as judgments in the minds of\nhumans (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000, 42.2\u20135, 124.10\u201311,\n207.4\u201314). He denies Avicenna\u2019s premise that possibility\nneeds a substrate. This premise is Aristotelian\u2014it is the basis\nto the principle of entelechy, namely that all things have\npotentialities and are driven to actualize them (Dutton 2001,\n26\u20137) Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee shifts, as Kukkonen (2000,\n488\u20139) puts it, the locus of the presumption of a thing\u2019s\nactual existence from the plane of the actualized reality to the plane\nof mental conceivability.\n\nWhen al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that \u201caccording to us\u201d\nthe connection between the efficient cause and its effect is not\nnecessary, he aims to point out that the connection could be\ndifferent even if it never will be different. For Avicenna, the fact\nthat the connection never was different and never will be different\nimplies that it is necessary. Nowhere in his works requires\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee that any given causal connection was different\nor will be different in order to be considered not necessary. We will\nsee that he, like Avicenna, assumes causal connections never were and\nnever will be different from what they are now. Still they are not\nnecessary, he maintains. The connection between a cause and its effect\nis contingent (mumkin) because an alternative to it is\nconceivable in our minds. We can imagine a world where fire does not\ncause cotton to combust. Or, to continue reading the initial statement\nof the 17th discussion:\n\n(\u2026) it is within divine power to create satiety without eating,\nto create death without a deep cut (hazz) in the neck, to\ncontinue life after having received a deep cut in the neck, and so on\nto all connected things. The fal\u00e2sifa deny the\npossibility of [this] and claim it to be impossible.\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 166.)\n\n\nOf course, a world where fire doesn\u2019t cause combustion in cotton\nwould be radically different from the one we live in. A change in a\nsingle causal connection would probably imply that many others would\nbe different as well. Still, such a world can be conceived in our\nminds, which means it is a possible world. God, however, did not\nchoose to create such an alternative possible world (Griffel 2009,\n172\u20133).\n\nIn the initial statement of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\nclaims that \u201cthe connection [between cause and effect] is due to\nthe prior decision (taqd\u00eer) of God.\u201d When he\nobjects to Avicenna that these connections are not necessary,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wishes to point out that God could have chosen\nto create an alternative world where the causal connections are\ndifferent from what they are. Avicenna denied this. This world is the\nnecessary effect of God\u2019s nature and a world different from this\none is unconceivable. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee objects and says this\nworld is the contingent effect of God\u2019s free will and His\ndeliberate choice between alternative worlds.\n",
