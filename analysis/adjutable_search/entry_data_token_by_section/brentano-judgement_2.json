Brentano himself says:\n\n\nBy \u201cjudgement\u201d we mean, in accordance with common\nphilosophical usage, acceptance [annehmen](as true) or\nrejection [verwerfen] (as false). We have already noted,\nhowever, that such acceptance or rejection also occurs in cases in\nwhich many people would not use the term \u201cjudgement,\u201d as,\nfor example, in the perception of mental acts and in remembering. (PES\n198 [II 34; SVS 1, 219])\n\n\nBrentano acknowledges that \u201caccepting as true\u201d or\n\u201crejecting as false\u201d is the natural way to describe an act\nof judgement (PES 201 [II 38; SVS 1, 223]). Meanwhile philosophers\nhave changed their habits. While it is still true, of course, that\njudgements can be true or false, most philosophers are swayed by\nFrege\u2019s or Reinach\u2019s argument that all judgements are\nacceptances as\n true.[7]\n When one rejects a proposition as false, e.g., that there is\nextraterrestrial life, this is still a positive judgement for them,\nbecause in making the judgement one takes it to be true that\nno life exists beyond earth. Brentano would contest this by saying\nthat their point only concerns the linguistic expression of our\njudgements, not the judgements themselves. We can find for each\njudgement a sentence that is true if and only if the judgement\nexpressed in it is correct, but that does not show that the judgement\nitself always has a positive quality.\n\nWhy does the characterization of judgement as either an accepting as\ntrue or a rejecting as false not suffice to distinguish judgement from\npresentation? After all, one can present something without accepting\nit as true. Because saying that in judgement we take something to be\ntrue is potentially misleading. The following passage shows what\nBrentano is aiming at:\n\n\nIf we say that every acknowledging judgement [anerkennendes\nUrteil] is an act of taking something to be true, and every\nrejecting judgement [verwerfendes Urteil] an act of taking\nsomething to be false, this does not mean that the former consists in\npredicating truth of what is taken to be true and the latter in\npredicating falsity of what is taken to be false. Our previous\ndiscussions have shown, rather, that what the expressions denote is a\nparticular kind of intentional reception of an object, a distinctive\nkind of mental reference to a content of consciousness. The only\ncorrect interpretation is that anyone who takes something to be true\nwill not only acknowledge the object, but, when asked whether the\nobject is to be acknowledged, will also acknowledge the object\u2019s\nto-be-acknowledgedness [das Anzuerkennensein], i.e., its\ntruth (which is all that is meant by this barbarous expression).\n(PES 240 [II 89; SVS 1, 259]; emphasis added and translation\nimproved).\n\n\nThe point that Brentano wants to get across is a delicate one and\nrequires a careful wording. It is no coincidence that Brentano prefers\nhere the term \u201canerkennen\u201d over\n\u201cannehmen\u201d, which would be closer to common usage\nin philosophy. The reason is that Brentano thinks that the more common\nway of speaking wrongly suggests that one predicates truth when one\naccepts something as true. According to Brentano, as will become clear\nlater, judgement requires no predication (not even a predication of\nexistence). Hence, the difference in meaning between \u201caccepting\n(annehmen)\u201d and \u201cacknowledging\n(anerkennen)\u201d becomes important for\n him.[8]\n\nBrentano\u2019s observation leads to an important result: To say that\nsomething is true does not mean that there is an object, a\nproposition, of which one predicates a property, being true. Rather,\nwe can take the act of judgement itself as the vehicle which is true.\nTo say that a judgement is true means to make a judgement of\nhigher-order, namely to acknowledge that the object of the first\njudgement is worthy of either being acknowledged or rejected.\nPropositions are not needed for making sense of the concept of\ntruth.\n",
