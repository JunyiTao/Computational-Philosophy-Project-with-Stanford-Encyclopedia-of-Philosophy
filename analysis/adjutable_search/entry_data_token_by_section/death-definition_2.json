    "main_text": "A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach || Appeals to the Essence of Human Persons\n2.1 Appeals to the Essence of Human Persons\n\nOne strategy for defending the higher-brain approach is to appeal to\nthe essence of human persons on the understanding that this essence\nrequires the capacity for consciousness (see, e.g., Bartlett and\nYoungner 1988; Veatch 1993; Engelhardt 1996, 248; Rich 1997; and Baker\n2000, 5). \u201cEssence\u201d here is intended in a strict\nontological sense: that property or set of properties of an individual\nthe loss of which would necessarily terminate the individual's\nexistence. From this perspective, we human persons\u2014more\nprecisely, we individuals who are at any time human persons\u2014are\nessentially beings with the capacity for consciousness such\nthat we cannot exist at any time without having this capacity at that\ntime. We go out of existence, it is assumed, when we die, so death\ninvolves the loss of what is essential to our existence.\n\nUnfortunately, the use of terminology in these arguments can be\nconfusing because the same term may be used in different ways and\nterms are frequently used without precise definition. It is sometimes\nclaimed, for example, that we are essentially persons. But\nwhat, exactly, is a person? Some authors (e.g., Engelhardt 1996, Baker\n2000) use the term to refer to beings with relatively complex\npsychological capacities such as self-awareness over time, reason, and\nmoral agency. Then the claim that we are essentially persons implies\nthat we die upon losing such advanced capacities. But this means that\nat some point during the normal course of progressive\ndementia the demented individual dies\u2014upon losing complex\npsychological capacities, however these are defined\u2014despite\nthe fact that a patient remains, clearly alive, with the capacity for\n(basic) consciousness. This view is extraordinarily radical and\nappears inconsistent with the higher-brain approach, which equates\ndeath with the irreversible loss of the capacity for (any) consciousness.\nA proponent of the view that we are essentially persons in the present\nsense, however, may hold that practical considerations\u2014such as\nthe impossibility of drawing a clear line between sentient persons and\nsentient nonpersons, and the potential for abuse of the\nelderly\u2014recommend the capacity for consciousness as the only\nsafe line to draw, thereby vindicating the higher-brain view\n(Engelhardt 1996, 250). Meanwhile, other proponents of the view that\nwe are essentially persons (e.g., Bartlett and Youngner 1988)\napparently hold that any member of our species who retains the\ncapacity for consciousness qualifies as a person. This view, unlike\nthe previous one, straightforwardly supports the higher-brain\nstandard. Still other authors (e.g., Veatch 1993) hold that we are\nessentially human beings where this term refers not to all\nmembers of our species but just to those judged to be persons by the\nprevious group of authors: members of our species who have the\ncapacity for consciousness. And some authors who defend the\nhigher-brain standard (e.g., McMahan 2002) assert that we are\nessentially minds or minded beings, which is to say\nbeings with the capacity for consciousness. In each case, an appeal to\nour essence is advanced to support the higher-brain standard.\n\nTaking this collection of arguments together, the reasoning might be\nreconstructed as follows:\n\nFor humans, the irreversible loss of the capacity for\nconsciousness entails (is sufficient for) the loss of what is\nessential to their existence;\nFor humans, loss of what is essential to their existence is (is\nnecessary and sufficient for) death;\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nFor humans, irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness\nentails (is sufficient for) death.\n\n\nWe have noted that various commentators who advance this reasoning\nhold that we are essentially persons in a sense requiring complex\npsychological capacities. We have noted that this implies that for\nthose of us who become progressively demented, we die\u2014go out of\nexistence\u2014at some point during the gradual slide to\npermanent unconsciousness. Even if practical considerations recommend\nsafely drawing a line at irreversible loss of the capacity of\nconsciousness for policy purposes, the implication that, strictly\nspeaking, we go out of existence during progressive dementia\nwill strike many as incredible. At the other end of life there is\nanother problematic implication. For if we are essentially persons (in\nthis sense), then inasmuch as human newborns lack the capacities that\nconstitute personhood, each of us came into existence after\nwhat is ordinarily described as his or her birth.\n\nFor those attracted to the general approach of understanding our\nessence in terms of psychological capacities, a promising alternative\nthesis is that we are essentially beings with the capacity for at\nleast some form of consciousness who die upon irreversibly losing that\nvery basic capacity. Stated more simply, we are essentially minded\nbeings, or minds, and we die when we completely \u201close our\nminds.\u201d (Note that this thesis is consistent with the claim that\nwe are also essentially embodied.)\n\nWhat, then, about the human organism associated with one of us minded\nbeings? Surely the fetus that gradually developed prior to the\nemergence of sentience or the capacity for consciousness\u2014that\nis, prior to the emergence of a mind\u2014was alive. On the other end\nof life, a patient in a PVS who is spontaneously breathing,\ncirculating blood, and exhibiting a full range of brainstem reflexes\nappears to be alive. Consider also anencephalic infants, who are born\nwithout cerebral hemispheres and never have the capacity for\nconsciousness: They, too, seem to be living organisms, their grim\nprognosis notwithstanding. In response to this challenge, a proponent\nof the higher-brain approach may either (1) assert that the\npresentient fetus, PVS patient, and anencephalic infant are not alive\ndespite appearances (Puccetti 1988) or (2) allow that these organisms\nare alive but are not of the same fundamental kind as we are: minded\nbeings (McMahan 2002, 423\u20136). Insofar as life is a biological\nconcept, and the organisms in question satisfy commonly accepted\ncriteria for life, option (1) seems at best hyperbolic. At best, the\nclaim is really that these organisms, though alive, are not alive in\nany state that matters much, so we may count them as dead or nonliving\nfor our purposes. This claim, in turn, may be understood as depending\non option (2), on which we may focus. This option implies that for\neach of us minded beings, there is a second, closely associated being:\na human organism. The prospects of the present strategy for defending\nthe higher-brain approach turn significantly on its ability to make\nsense of this picture of two closely associated beings: (1) the\norganism, which comes into existence at conception or shortly\nthereafter (perhaps after twinning is no longer possible) and dies\nwhen organismic functioning radically breaks down, and (2) the minded\nbeing, who comes into existence when sentience emerges and\nmight\u2014in the event of PVS or irreversible coma\u2014die before the\norganism does. (For doubts on this score, see DeGrazia 2005, ch.\n2).\n\nAppealing to the authority of biologists and common sense, some\nphilosophers (e.g., Olson 1997) charge as indefensible the claim that\nwe (who are now) human persons were never presentient fetuses. One\nmight also find puzzling the thesis that there is one definition of\ndeath, appealing to the capacity for consciousness, for human beings\nor persons and another definition, appealing to organismic\nfunctioning, for nonhuman animals and the human organisms associated\nwith persons. It is open to the higher-brain theorist, however, to\nallow that there are also two closely associated beings in the case of\nsentient nonhuman animals\u2014the minded being and the\norganism\u2014with the death of, say, Lassie (the minded dog)\noccurring at her irreversible loss of consciousness (McMahan 2002, ch.\n1). But some will find unattractive the failure to furnish a single\nconception of death that applies to all living things. To be sure, not\neveryone finds these objections compelling.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges confronting the present\napproach is to characterize cogently the relationship between one of\nus and the associated human organism. The relationship is clearly not\nidentity\u2014that is, being one and the same\nthing\u2014because the organism originates before the mind, might\noutlive the mind, and therefore has different persistence conditions.\nThis strongly suggests, perhaps surprisingly, that we human persons\nare not animals. If you are not identical to the human organism\nassociated with you, then since there is at most one animal sitting in\nyour chair, you are not she and are therefore not an animal (Olson\n1997). Yet many consider it part of educated common sense that we are\nanimals.\n\nMight you be part of the organism associated with\nyou\u2014namely, the brain (more precisely, the portions of the brain\nassociated with consciousness) (McMahan 2002, ch. 1)? But the brain\nseems capable of surviving death, when you are supposed to go out of\nexistence. Are you then a functioning brain, which goes out\nof existence at the irreversible loss of consciousness? But it seems\nodd to identify the functioning brain\u2014as distinct from\nthe brain\u2014as you. How could you be some organ only when it\nfunctions? Presumably you are a substance (see the entry on\n substance),\n a bearer of properties, not a substance only when it has certain\nproperties. One might reply that the functioning brain is itself\na substance, a substance distinct from the brain, but that, too,\nstrains credibility. Might you instead be not the brain, but the mind\nunderstood as the conscious properties of the brain? That\nwould imply that you are a set of properties, rather than a substance,\nwhich is no less counterintuitive. Note that the charge of\nincredibility is not directed at the assertion that the mind\nis the functioning brain, or is a set of brain properties, and not a\ndistinct substance\u2014a thesis in good standing in the philosophy\nof mind (see the entries on\n identity theory of mind\n and\n functionalism).\n The charge of incredibility is directed at the assertion that\nyou are a set of properties and not a\n substance.[2]\n\nAnother possibility regarding the person/organism relationship is that\nthe human organism constitutes the person it eventually comes\nto support (Baker 2000). One might even claim the legitimacy of\nsaying\u2014employing an \u201cis\u201d of constitution\u2014that\nwe are animals (or organisms), just as we can say that a\nstatue constituted by a hunk of bronze, shaped in a particular way, is\na hunk of bronze (ibid). Challenges to this reasoning includes doubts\nthat we may legitimately speak of an \u201cis\u201d of constitution;\nif not, then the constitution view implies that we are not animals\nafter all. Another challenge, which applies equally to the view that\nwe minds are parts of organisms, concerns the counting of conscious\nbeings. On either the constitution view or the part-whole view, you\nare essentially a being with the capacity for consciousness. Closely\nassociated with you\u2014without being (identical to) you, due to\ndifferent persistence conditions\u2014is a particular animal. But\nthat animal, having a functioning brain, would also seem to be a\nconscious being. Either of these views, then, apparently suggests that\nfor each of us there are two conscious beings, seemingly one too many.\nDespite such difficulties as these, the thesis that we are essentially\nminded beings remains a significant basis for the higher-brain approach to human death.\n",
