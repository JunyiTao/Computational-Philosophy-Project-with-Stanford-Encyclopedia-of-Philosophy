    "main_text": "Major Works || Sex in the Ancient World\n3.6 Sex in the Ancient World\n\nFoucault\u2019s final engagement with traditional philosophy arises\nfrom the turn toward the ancient world he took in the last few years\nof his life. The History of Sexuality had been planned as a\nmulti-volume work on various themes in a study of modern sexuality.\nThe first volume, discussed above, was a general introduction.\nFoucault wrote a second volume (Les aveux de la chair) that\ndealt with the origins of the modern notion of the subject in the\npractices of Christian confession, but he never published it. (It was\npublished posthumously in 2018.) His concern was that a proper\nunderstanding of the Christian development required a comparison with\nancient conceptions of the ethical self, something he undertook in his\nlast two books (1984) on Greek and Roman sexuality: The Use of\nPleasure and The Care of the Self.\n\nThese treatments of ancient sexuality moved Foucault into ethical\nissues that had been implicit but seldom explicitly thematized in his\nearlier writings. What emerges out of his historical studies of\nancient sexuality is a particular conception of ethics that he traces\nto antiquity. In the ancient conception, ethics referred to the\npractice through which one forms oneself as an ethical subject\nfollowing the prescriptive elements of morality. It concerns the way\nin which moral rules can be adopted and problematized by the subjects\nthemselves.\n\nThe importance of a study of ethics becomes apparent when we try to\nmake visible the difference between the morality of antiquity and that\nof Christianity. Foucault\u2019s specific goal was to compare ancient\npagan and Christian ethics through the test-case of sexuality and to\ntrace the development of Christian ideas about sex from the very\ndifferent ideas of the ancients. He argues that, contrary to what is\noften believed, on the level of moral codes of behavior, there are in\nfact striking similarities between antiquity and Christianity. Both\nshared, for example, a concern that sexual expenditure could harm an\nindividual\u2019s health, and they both valued conjugal fidelity and\nsexual abstinence. But there was a strong contrast in the ways these\ntwo cultures understood and practiced these ideals and demands.\n\nIn the Christian view sexual acts were, on the whole, evil in\nthemselves and most forms of sexual activity were simply forbidden. A\nmain emphasis in Christian morality is therefore on the moral code,\nits systematicity, its richness, and its capacity to adjust to every\npossible case and to embrace every area of behavior. The rules in\nChristian monasteries, for example, were not only very severe, but\nalso extremely detailed. In the morality of antiquity, on the other\nhand, the code and rules of behavior were rudimentary. The ancient\nGreeks\u2019 view was that sexual acts were natural and necessary,\nbut subject to abuse. They emphasized the proper use\n(chresis) of pleasures, where this involved engaging in a\nrange of sexual activities (heterosexual, homosexual, in marriage, out\nof marriage), but with proper moderation. Their texts discussing\nmorality therefore lay down very few explicit rules or guidelines on\nthe kinds of sexual acts that one should engage in. More important\nthan the moral rules was the relationship that one had with oneself,\nthe choice of the \u201cstyle of existence\u201d made by the\nindividual. Sexual austerity, for example, was not practiced as a\nresult of prohibitions, but because of a personal choice to live a\nbeautiful life and to leave to others memories of a beautiful\nexistence. Sex for the Greeks was a major part of what Foucault called\nan \u201caesthetics of existence\u201d: the self\u2019s creation of\na beautiful and enjoyable existence (The Use of Pleasure,\n[1985: 12]).\n\nFoucault\u2019s last two books are an attempt to make a contribution\nto the task of rethinking ethics, but they are also a continuation of\nhis attempt to rethink the subject. Now the focus is on the forms of\nunderstanding that subjects create about themselves and the practices\nby which they transform their mode of being. In his study of ancient\nGreek ethics, Foucault continued to pursue his idea that there was no\ntrue self that could be deciphered and emancipated, but that the self\nwas something that had been\u2014and must be\u2014created. There is,\nhowever, a whole new axis of analysis present in his late studies of\nthe subject. While his earlier genealogical studies investigated the\nways in which power/knowledge networks constituted the subject, his\nlate work emphasizes the subject\u2019s own role in this process. It\ntherefore offers a more complex understanding of the subject. Subjects\nare not simply constructed by power; they themselves partake in that\nconstruction and modify themselves through practices of the self. They\nare not just docile bodies, but actively refuse, adopt and alter forms\nof being a subject. One way of contesting normalizing power is by\nshaping oneself and one\u2019s lifestyle creatively: by exploring\nopportunities for new ways of being, new fields of experience,\npleasures, relationships, modes of living and thinking.\n",
