    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Monism and pluralism\n3.2 Monism and pluralism\n\nThe second doctrine is the modulation and gradation of existence\n(tashkik al-wujud). The semantics of the term\n\u2018existence\u2019 and its modulated singularity commits Mulla\nSadra to a reality that is equally modulated and singular. Existence\nis a singular reality, as the phenomenal experience of existence as\nmultiple is illusory. But multiplicity in this world still needs to be\nexplained. Different existents in this world are thus different,\nintense degrees of a single whole. Thus there is a horizontal and a\nvertical hierarchy of existence that is connected and involved in a\nwhole chain of existence. The particular degrees of existence are not\nstable substances in the Aristotelian sense, and thus neither is\nSadrian ontology concerned with a multiplicity of substances or the\nproblem that would be raised by the objection: how can all things be\none substance? Gradation addresses one of the key problematics of\nmetaphysics that arise from Aristotelianism: \u201cbeing is\npredicated in many ways\u201d (Aristotle, Met. 1028a10).\nBeing is a common term that is applied to a number of contexts and\nexpressions: the mental context (mental being, conceptual being), the\nspoken context (being in speech), the written context (inscribed\nbeing), and the real context (concrete, extra-mental being). In all\nthese contexts, being is a shared notion and reality expressed in\ndifferent ways. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the doctrine\nis the claim that, not only is being the source of commonality, the\nfocal meaning of the instances of being as the Aristotelian tradition\nwould have it, it is also the source of metaphysical variance or\ndistinction, because the hierarchy of being is differentiated through\ndegrees of intensification and debilitation of being (ishtidad wa\ntada\u2018\u2018uf). Thus the old metaphysical debate about the\nOne and the many is settled in favour of both: being or existence is\nboth singular and multiple. The doctrine of the gradation thus\nprovides an explanation for the nature of spiritual hierarchies and\nthe different abilities and dispositions of people but also insists\nupon the ultimate singularity of human existence. Thus the ethical\nimplications of the doctrine are a thorough social and ontological\nequality of existents (including humanity, animals, and so forth)\ncoupled with an intellectual and spiritual hierarchy, order, and\ninequality. Mulla Sadra summaries modulation in the following\nmanner:\n\nExistence is a single, simple reality having neither genus nor\ndifferentia, nor a definition or a demonstration or a\ndefiniens. It only admits of degrees by perfection and\ndeficiency (bi-l-kamal wa-l-naqs), by priority and\nposteriority (al-taqaddum wa-l-ta\u2019akhkhur) and by\nindependence and dependence (bi-l-ghina wa-l-haja). (Mulla\nSadra 1964: 68\u20139)\n\n\nThis leads us to the third doctrine that all individuals in existence\nundergo motion and flux, namely, substantial motion (haraka\njawhariyya). The doctrine follows from his position on existence\nand his rejection of Aristotle\u2019s category theory. It also\ndemonstrates how he privileges becoming over static, immutable being.\nSubstantial motion is not the same as substances being in motion,\nwhich is considered obvious (Rahman 1975: 95\u2013108; Jambet 2006:\n191\u2013223; \u2018Ubudiyyat 2006: 309\u201385). Within an\nAristotelian framework, there are two types of change: instantaneous\nsuch as the move from potentiality to actuality, and gradual such as\nthe ageing process in things that undergo generation and corruption.\nThis raises two objections to substantial motion: first, if existents\nare constantly motive, how can there be a subject that we recognise as\nundergoing change? Second, substances are manifest in essences and\nthese cannot be identified in their species form since motion denies\nthe fixity of the species (and genus) boundaries that define the\nessence. For Mulla Sadra, the second point is easier to treat:\nessences are not fundamental to which existence is accidental so the\nboundaries of what we may conceive an essence to be should not limit\nexistence. On the former, existence is its own subject. Drawing upon\nAristotelian hylomorphism, he argues that it is the matter of\nexistence that acquires forms as it constantly changes. An existing\nentity is not a stable substance constant in time to which change\noccurs as an accident, such as a young Zayd becoming old and greying;\nrather, it is a structure of unfolding, dynamic events of existence.\nThe young Zayd is thus literally not the same existent as the old\nZayd, since the change in him is substantial and existential. One\nimplication of this doctrine is that at every instance each existent\nis renewed and thus provides a solution to the old problem of time and\ncreation by asserting that the world is created in time, because at\neach instant all existence is new in time. As such consistent with\nother Safavid philosophers and in distinction from the earlier\nAvicennan tradition, he upholds a philosophical account of the\ntheological doctrine of God\u2019s creation of the world from nothing\nin time. Another implication is to consider time as a dimension of\nexistence, as an analytic property of substantial motion, having no\nexistence independently.\n",
