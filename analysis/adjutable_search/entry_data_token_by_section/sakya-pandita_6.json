    "main_text": "Defending the Dharma: A Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows || Considering Wider Ethical Applications\n3.4 Considering Wider Ethical Applications\n\nThese considerations bring Sapa\u1e47 to some profound analyses that\nsubtly divide the conceivable, causal reality from the inconceivable,\nand push the reader to contemplate his deeper message. One of these is\nstimulated by an opponent\u2019s proposal that even though\ntechnically you cannot dedicate the Dharmadh\u0101tu, perhaps\nthere is no harm in saying that you dedicate it. This may\nseem like an elegant appeal to the conventionality of conventional\nreality, and the general Buddhist emphasis on the intention or the\naspiration as the source and cause of virtue. Yet it is just here that\nSapa\u1e47 shows his exacting requirement that there be no\n\u201cmixing\u201d of the Great Vehicle and Disciple\u2019s paths:\n\u201cThat dedication is harmful. Because it involves the perception\nof an object, it will become a poisonous dedication\u201d (I.111;\nRhoton 2002: 55). The point is that bodhisattvas have a different\nunderstanding of the dedicatory ritual than Disciples, rooted\nin the bodhisattva\u2019s understanding that there is no real object\nthat can be dedicated. The compassion that motivates the\nbodhisattva\u2019s dedication of merit is a universal, ultimate\ncompassion whose nature is inseparable from emptiness. To imagine that\nthe Dharmadh\u0101tu as an object is a (non-empty) and hence\n\u201cdedicatable\u201d thing is to turn a Great Vehicle concept\ninto an ordinary conceptual construction, and thereby poison the\naltruistic\n intention.[17]\n\n\nPerhaps the most important \u201cpractical\u201d ethical result of\nthis discussion appears in Sapa\u1e47\u2019s clear advocacy of moral\ncontextualism. Different systems of vows require different\nbehaviors\u2014and yet within each system, these behaviors are\nmorally significant and genuinely beneficial or harmful. The fact that\nthere are some eighteen different systems of monastic vows, which\ndiffer among themselves about countless particulars, does not\nundermine the validity of each system on its own terms, and does not\nallow for impromptu mixing and matching. A resonant example\nSapa\u1e47 cites is that whereas some systems consider the killing of\nan unborn fetus an instance of the taking of a human life, other\nsystems do not. But the taking of a human life is one of the principal\ndownfalls (p\u0101r\u0101jika), an irredeemable infraction of\nthe monastic vows that causes immediate expulsion. And presumably, if\nyou have violated your vows in this way, you cannot simply move to\nanother monastery where killing a fetus is not considered having taken\na human life. But more importantly, Sapa\u1e47 explains that the\nvows, though they differ one from the other, are all approved by the\nBuddha as sets that serve the function of monastic vows, which is to\nprevent the vow-holder\u2019s mind from straying into\ninfractions\u2014like a fence around a field. Vows have morally\nconsequential effects upon the mind, and they consist in coherent,\nBuddha-approved systems.\n\nThe final argument from the Three Vows I will mention is in\nthe chapter on Mantra vows, but is clearly connected with the topics\nalready discussed here. One of the issues most important to\nSapa\u1e47\u2014he lists it twice in the final summary lists of\nessential topics mentioned above, and he also treats it in the\nSage\u2019s Intent\u2014is the misuse of\nVajrav\u0101r\u0101h\u012b (Vajra Sow) blessings as a\nsubstitute for Mantric initiation. This, he says, is not taught in any\nof the scriptures. You need a real initiation ritual to practice\nMantra\u2014it\u2019s as simple as that! You cannot substitute a\nblessing for an initiation. He calls the alterations in the dharma\n\u201cthe blessings of demons\u201d\u2014claiming not that his\ncontemporaries are demons, but that they have been deceived.\n\nWhat irks Sapa\u1e47 the most, it would seem, is what he sees as an\nattempt to excuse carelessness by appealing to the fact that rituals\nare only conventional constructions. He concludes the point by saying\nthat all rites belong to conventional reality: Disciples,\nGreat Vehicle, and Mantra rites. If you accept any of the systems, you\nmust accept them in their entirety; you must do all, or\nnone. There is no option to make a distinction between\nessential and non-essential doctrines based on the distinction between\nconventional and ultimate. The ultimate simply does not enter into the\nconsideration of whether a rite or ritual\u2014or, for that matter,\nany karma, any act\u2014is\n appropriate.[18]\n The separate systems have each been handed down through valid\nlineages with their own integrity, valued and delimited\nalways by their conventional utility. The fact that\nthey are not ultimate is not an excuse to experiment or play fast and\nloose with the rituals and their interpretation. Everything that we\ncan do, everything that we can say, is only conventional; but that\nfact does not license the blurring of the lines between the effective,\nwell delineated paths taught by the Buddha that can lead us to\nliberation if we follow them with care.\n",
