    "main_text": "Recognition || Price\u2019s Metaphysical Neutrality regarding Recurrence and Properties\n5.1 Price\u2019s Metaphysical Neutrality regarding Recurrence and Properties\n\nHow should recurrence be analysed (1953a: ch. 1)? One proposal is that\nrecurrence consists in a universal (or characteristic) being\npresent in different things. An alternative analysis invokes the\nnotion of resemblance. Rather than saying red things have a\nuniversal in common it is proposed that red things resemble each\nother. In a rich discussion which is, besides his work on perception,\nprobably his most influential, Price finds difficulties and strengths\nin both ways of speaking. \n\nMost notably, on what Armstrong (1978: 15) calls Price\u2019s\n\u201cfully worked-out\u201d analysis of resemblance nominalism,\nsomething is in the class of things with recurring feature F if\nit resembles a group of standard F-objects, exemplars, as\nclosely as the exemplars resemble each other (1953a: 20\u201322). See\nalso, e.g., Armstrong (1978: 46ff, 54f; 1989: 15, 17, 47f);\nRodriguez-Pereyra (2002: ch. 7) describes Price\u2019s\n\u201cAristocratic Resemblance Nominalism\u201d (2002: 10) as the\nversion which \u201ccurrent writers on the topic usually have in\nmind\u201d; and Paseau (2015: 95) criticises resemblance theories for\n\u201cthe misleading connotation of subjectivity or\nanthropocentricism\u201d. However, Price works out what he calls\n\u201cThe Philosophy of Resemblances\u201d. He distinguishes this\n\u201contological doctrine\u201d as the \u201cstarting\npoint for\u201d \u201cepistemological theories\u201d such as\nnominalism, conceptualism, and imagism (1953a: 22\u201323). The\nontological view he works out is thus not necessarily nominalist.\n\nIn his view, both analyses of recurrence are ultimately satisfactory\nbut have inelegant aspects in certain contexts. We can employ either\ndepending on which helps. Price distinguishes the views as two\nalternative ways of describing matters: sameness versus\nresemblance. This illustrates Price\u2019s special sort of\nmetaphysical neutralism (see also\n \u00a72.4\n above). The universals and resemblance languages are \u201ctwo\ndifferent (systematically different) terminologies, two systematically\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing\u201d (1953a: 30); Armstrong\ncalls Price\u2019s the \u201calternative languages view\u201d\n(1978: 47; 1989: 139). For criticism, see Raphael (1954\u201355:\n\u00a72) and Brandt (1954: 633). Notably, Price\u2019s (1946) earlier\nHertz lecture defends realism about universals against resemblance\ntheories (Brandt 1954: 633; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002: 125). It is an\ninteresting, though unexplored, question how Price\u2019s version of\nneutralism compares with apparently similar meta-ontological positions\nsuch as Carnap\u2019s (1950). \n\nMost importantly for him, Price frequently argues that his many\ndistinctions and general approach to recognition and mental life\noverall are compatible with whichever view one takes on key\nmetaphysical issues such as the natures of properties and of\nperception (Butchvarov 1998: 94\u201396 discusses this and highlights\nsimilarities with Strawson 1966: 47\u201348; 1985: ch. 4). For\ninstance, when drawing the primary and secondary recognition\ndistinction (see\n \u00a75.3),\n he argues for this in detail (see 1953a: 55\u201374 [on properties],\n50 [perception]; see also\n \u00a72.4).\n",
