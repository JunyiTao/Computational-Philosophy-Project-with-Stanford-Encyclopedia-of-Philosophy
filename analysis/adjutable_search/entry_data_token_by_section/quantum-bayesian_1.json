    "main_text": "QBism || History\n1.1 History\n\nContemporary QBists (Mermin 2014: 422; Fuchs 2011) have sought\nprecedents among such authorities as Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Niels\nBohr, Wolfgang Pauli, J.A. Wheeler, and William James. But what came\nto be known as quantum-Bayesianism and later QBism began as a\ncollaboration between Caves, Fuchs, and Schack at the turn of the\n21st century (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2002a,b), although\nCaves no longer considers himself a QBist. N. David Mermin (2014,\n2019) became a convert more recently and has proposed extending the\nQBist vision of science to resolve at least one long-standing\nconceptual issue raised by classical physics. Stacey (2019,\n Other Internet Resources)\n tracks changes from the Quantum-Bayesianism of 2002 to the QBism of\n2019.\n\nIn conformity with standard terminology, on which the word\n\u201cBayesian\u201d does not carry a commitment to denying\nobjective probability, proponents of QBism no longer take the\n\u201cB\u201d to refer simply to Bayesianism. Insisting that\nprobability has no physical existence even in a quantum world, they\nfollow Bruno de Finetti in identifying probability with coherent\ndegree of belief or credence. But according to Fuchs (2016,\n Other Internet Resources)\n \u201cB\u201d should not be taken to abbreviate\n\u201cBrunism\u201d since de Finetti would not have accepted all of\nQBism\u2019s metaphysics: so \u201cQBism\u201d is now best\nunderstood simply as a stand-alone proper name for the view of quantum\ntheory described in what follows.\n",
