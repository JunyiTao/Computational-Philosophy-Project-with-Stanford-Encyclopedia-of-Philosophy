    "main_text": "Logical developments and paradoxes until 1930 || Type-theoretic developments and the paradoxes\n4.2 Type-theoretic developments and the paradoxes\n\nConcerning the subsequent developments in connection with logic, the\nprocess of streamlining the tools of logic steadily continued in\nG\u00f6ttingen through the work of Hilbert and his school. This is\nespecially clear from his unpublished lecture notes (e.g., those of\nWinter-Semester course 1917\u20131918 Prinzipien der\nMathematik), which are in many respects close to the textbook of\nHilbert-Ackermann of 1928 and which contain formulations of first and\nsecond order logic, together with ramified type theory and the axiom\nof reducibility. Paradoxes are derived by allowing a suitable form of\nunrestricted comprehension; the problematic assumption is located in\nthe admissibility of predicates and propositions as objects,\ni.e., formally in the expressions \\(X(Y), P(P)\\). Variants of the\ntraditional Liar and of the Berry antinomy are introduced.\nInterestingly, Hilbert sticks essentially to type theory (he does not\nlecture upon Zermelo\u2019s system); he defines the ramified theory\nof types with the axiom of reducibility, proving that certain parts of\nmathematics can be carried out in the system (on Russell\u2019s\ninfluence, see Mancosu 2003).\n\nThat type theory and Russell\u2019s work had a central place not only\nin Hilbert\u2019s G\u00f6ttingen is further attested to by the work\nof Chwistek and Ramsey, who attempted a revision of Principia\nMathematica (PM) from opposite stand-points. Both authors\nrejected ramified type theory (RTT, in short) and the axiom of\nreducibility. Their work can be considered a typical outcome of the\nprocess that was to yield streamlined versions of logical formalisms.\nInsofar as paradoxes are concerned, the main problem is to show that\nRTT is not required for solving the paradoxes.\n\nThe solution proposed by Chwistek was prompted by a\nconstructivistic/predicativistic conception. His position in 1921 was\nthat Principia Mathematica were not enough to avoid\nRichard\u2019s classical antinomy. On the other hand, Chwistek\nproposed a version of the Liar that can be reconstructed in the simple\ntheory of types without the axiom of reducibility, once we are allowed\nto quantify over all propositions. On his side, Chwistek adhered to a\nkind of nominalistic position, and tried to develop a theory of\nconstructive types for the foundations of analysis (his attempt of\nfounding mathematics without the axiom of reducibility was called\n\u201cheroic\u201d in the introduction to the second edition of the\nPrincipia Mathematica, 1925, see Linsky 2004).\n\nRamsey 1926 introduced the by-now standard distinction between\nlogical and epistemological contradictions (but see already\nPeano 1906, and section 3.3.1 of this entry). While logical\ncontradictions involve mathematical or logical terms, like class,\nnumber, and hence show that our logic or mathematics is problematic,\nsemantical contradictions involve, besides purely logical terms,\nnotions like \u201cthought\u201d, \u201clanguage\u201d,\n\u201csymbolism\u201d, which, according to Ramsey, are empirical\n(not formal) terms. Hence these contradictions are due to faulty ideas\nabout thought or language and they properly belong to\n\u201cepistemology\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ramsey, the antinomies of the first group (such as\nRussell\u2019s, or Burali-Forti\u2019s) can be avoided by referring\nto a universe of mathematical objects which is structured into types\nof individuals, functions of individuals, functions of functions of\nindividuals, etc. Quantification over arbitrary types is legitimate\nand hence types are closed under impredicative comprehension, which is\nconsidered necessary for mathematics. Types are intrinsic to logical\nand mathematical objects and the logical paradoxes are exactly those\nwhich require type distinctions to be solved (e.g., self-membership is\nblocked for objects in the type-theoretic hierarchy). In order to\nsolve the semantical antinomies (e.g., the Liar, Berry\u2019s),\nRamsey proposes to distinguish several notions of meaning. In light of\nlater developments, it is interesting to note that for him\nsemantics is not a viable universal notion: in particular, it\nis impossible to obtain \u201can all-inclusive relation of meaning\nfor propositional functions. Whatever one we take there is still a way\nof constructing a symbol to mean in a way not included in our\nrelation. The meanings of meaning form an illegitimate totality\u201d\n(Ramsey 1926, p. 372). This yields the clue to the solution of\nGrelling\u2019s paradox (see 3.3.2). Let \\(R\\) be the meaning\nrelation linking an adjective \\(f\\) to the corresponding propositional\nfunction denoted by \\(F\\) (so that \\(f R F\\) holds). In the definition\nof \u201cheterological\u201d we do use the relation \\(R: x\\) is\nheterological iff there exists \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) does not apply to\n\\(x\\) and \\(x R F\\). Now, there exists a propositional function, say\n\\(H\\), which is the meaning of the adjective\n\u201cheterological\u201d. Ramsey\u2019s point is that this sense\nof meaning cannot be the same as that given by \\(R\\) and this blocks\nthe contradiction, when we apply \\(H\\) to \u201cheterological\u201d\n(ibid.,p. 370). So one needs a new meaning relation depending on the\ngiven fixed \\(R\\). These ideas foreshadow those of Tarski. (For an\nanalysis of semantical antinomies in a ramified context, compare also\nthe later contribution of Church 1976, also reconsidered and\ncriticized in Martino 2001.).\n",
