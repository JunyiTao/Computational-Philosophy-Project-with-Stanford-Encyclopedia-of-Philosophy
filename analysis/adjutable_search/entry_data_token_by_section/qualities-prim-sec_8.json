These are our SQs\u2014in fact,\non two occasions, Boyle refers to them as \u201csecondary\nqualities\u201d. Sensible qualities are present in bodies that\noperate on human beings so as to cause the sort of ideas on account of\nwhich we ascribe colors, etc. to bodies. Names given to the various\nideas of SQs are also used to designate the corresponding qualities,\nso \u201ccolor\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, etc. can be used to stand\nfor qualities in the scope of corpuscularian explanation (OFQ [1991:\n24, 30\u20134, 51\u20132]). Boyle is a Cartesian mind-body dualist.\nAlthough he discusses perception in several texts, he has no well\ndeveloped account (see Anstey 2000: 68\u201385). OFQ sticks to the\nphysical project announced at the start.\n\nScholars have taken five basic positions on this question.\n\nPeter Alexander (1974: 229\u2013238; 1985: 73\u201385) argues\nthat qualities that are sensible are textures, but colors, green,\nblue, etc. are nothing but mind-dependent sensations. But textual\nevidence of this is compromised by the ambiguity of names of SQs\n(Anstey 2000).\nMackie (1976: 14\u201315) suggests SQs are dispositions based on\nthe intrinsic MAs of the bodies to which the qualities belong, The\nmain problem is that the texts do not clearly articulate the\ndistinction between a disposition and its basis in things that are so\ndisposed. Boyle\u2019s terminology is unstable across different\nworks, and less than precise (Stewart 1991: xiv), and the texts focus\non the horizontal two-place relation between bodies (or bodies and\nperceivers) that form a quality without saying much about the vertical\npresumably three-place relation between a quality and two sets of\nMAs.\nAccording to Anstey (2000: 105\u201307), Boyle\u2019s natural\nphilosophical work shows a deep interest in framing hypotheses about\nthe corpuscular constitutions of specific qualities, i.e., physical\nreductions of qualities deemed possible, but his work also exhibits a\ndeep investment in the CT which states that MAs are basic and\nqualities are dependent entities which are explained by them. Anstey\nconcludes these commitments are inconsistent and irreconcilable.\nKeating (1993) argues that Boyle\u2019s strong inclination toward\nthe reduction of qualities to MAs pushes him to say that colors, etc.\nare mind-dependent sensations.\nO\u2019Toole (1974: 307\u201313; followed by Kaufman (2006:\n190\u20131)) argues that for Boyle, qualities are relational\nproperties of bodies rather than intrinsic to any one body. He notes\nthat the texts taken to say the SQs of a pair of bodies are identical\nto their MAs actually say that in each body there is nothing but its\nMAs while saying the quality is a relation over and above that We\nmentioned congruance and spatial and temporal co-existence; means of\napplying one body to the other are also suggested.\n\n",
