    "main_text": "Non-rational Beings and Disabled Humans\n11. Non-rational Beings and Disabled Humans\n\nSeveral recent discussions of Kant\u2019s moral theory have focused\non understanding and assessing its implications for how we should\nregard and treat people with various kinds of disabilities. Kant does\nnot say much explicitly about those with disabilities, but his moral\nframework is often seen as both hostile to and supportive of the\ninterests of disabled people.\n\nOne of the most important criticisms of Kant\u2019s moral theory\nconcerns human beings with severe cognitive disabilities who lack the\nmoral capacities and dispositions that, according to Kant, are needed\nfor people to have dignity, be ends in themselves, possess moral\nrights, legislate moral laws, be a member of the kingdom of ends, or\notherwise have basic moral status (Kittay 2005, Vorhaus 2020, Barclay\n2020; cf. the SEP entry \n  cognitive disability and moral status).\nWhen we reflect on what makes us morally special, according to Kant,\nwe find that it is not our contingent properties, the biological\nspecies we belong to, or even our capacity to be conscious or to feel\npain. Kant argues that rational nature, specifically the moral\ncapacities and dispositions to legislate and follow moral principles,\nis what gives us inner worth and makes us deserving of respect (G\n4:428\u201336, 446\u20137; Rel 6:26). Our basic moral status does not come in\ndegrees. It is always equal to that of other people regardless of the\nlevel, if any, at which our moral capacities and dispositions are\ndeveloped, realized, or exercised. Infants and young children,\naccording to Kant, almost always have a moral nature even though their\nmoral capacities and dispositions are undeveloped or underdeveloped\n(MM 6:280\u20131, 422; see also Schapiro 1999). Virtually all people with\nDown Syndrome and autism have basic moral status even if their moral\ncapacities and dispositions are not as fully realized or exercised as\nthey are in other people. Being asleep or in a coma does not preclude\nsomeone from having basic moral status even if their moral capacities\nand dispositions are temporarily or permanently dormant. Some human\nbeings with significant cognitive disabilities, however, do not have\neven bare capacities or dispositions to recognize, accept, legislate,\nand follow moral norms. Kant seems to imply that anencephalic infants,\nthose in persistent vegetative states, and other human beings with the\nmost severe cognitive disabilities lack dignity and are not ends in\nthemselves. They are apparently excluded from the moral community in\nways that have unacceptable implications for how we should or should\nnot regard and treat them.\n\nThere is little or no evidence that Kant himself thought about this\nproblem, which is also connected with the moral status of many\nnon-human animals who seem to matter morally but who lack the moral\ncapacities and dispositions that, according to Kant, are necessary for\nbasic moral status.  Kant\u2019s defenders have nonetheless explored\nwhat his basic moral framework might imply about the moral status of\nthose with severe cognitive disabilities. One approach is simply to\nbite the bullet by admitting that people with certain severe cognitive\ndisabilities lack the basic moral status that others of us share (Wood\n1998, Sussman 2001. (This general strategy is deployed by Regan and\nfollowed by Wood, McMahan, Warren, Merkel, and others. For the claim\nthat such humans are not persons, on Kant\u2019s theory, see also\nSussman, Idea, 242.) Proponents of this view can emphasize\nthat, although we do not have duties to such people, we can have\nduties regarding them, such as duties of moral self-improvement that\ngive us reasons to treat those with significant cognitive disabilities\nhumanely for the sake of improving how we treat other human beings\nwith basic moral status (MM 6:442) or duties of beneficence that give\nus reasons to care for them as a kindness to their families (G 4:430).\nPragmatic considerations might also give us reasons to err on the side\nof caution when it comes to assessing whether someone entirely lacks\nthe moral capacities and dispositions that ground basic moral status.\nBecause of difficulties making such determinations and the moral risks\ninvolved in judging incorrectly, we should perhaps assume, unless we\nhave very strong evidence to the contrary, that each human being has\nbasic moral status (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nA second approach to addressing the problem of moral status for those\nwith significant cognitive disabilities is to emphasize passages in\nwhich Kant says all human beings have dignity or are ends in\nthemselves (G 4:428\u201329; MM 6:410) and to argue that, according\nto Kant\u2019s theories of biology and psychology, all human beings,\nincluding those with severe cognitive disabilities, necessarily have\nthe requisite features of moral personhood (Kain 2009). A third\napproach is to draw on and perhaps supplement some of Kant\u2019s\nmoral views by, for example, arguing that because we value things, we\nmust value ourselves as ends, which in turn commits us to valuing all\nhuman and non-human animals as ends (Korsgaard 2020) or that respect\nfor all human beings is a constitutive feature of rational agency that\ndoes not depend on any intrinsic properties of the objects of\nrespect (Sensen 2018).\n\nIn addition to discussing the moral status of people with severe\ncognitive disabilities, Kantian philosophers have also been exploring\nhow his moral theory applies to other moral issues that concern how we\nshould regard and treat people with disabilities. Although\nKant\u2019s focus was on specifying principles for all circumstances\nor for all human contexts, he recognized that a complete specification\nof his system of moral duties, ends, and ideals must include\napplications of basic moral standards to particular contexts and\ngroups of people (MM 6:468\u20139). \n\nWhen prospective parents choose not to produce children that would\nlikely have disabilities, they might express disrespectful attitudes\nabout existing people with disabilities (Velleman 2015, Sussman 2018).\nPeople with disabilities are often ridiculed, abused, treated as\nchildren, denied opportunities to continue developing their natural\nabilities in, for example, assisted living facilities that instead\nemphasize their comfort, and excluded from friendships or other forms\nof solidarity in ways that arguably violate moral duties that Kant\ndescribes (Cureton 2021, Hill 2020). They often face obstacles to\ndeveloping and maintaining self-respect by those who regard them as,\nfor example, burdensome, malingering, or curiosities (Stohr 2018).\nPeople with disabilities also tend to receive assistance from others\nthat is incompatible with the respect they are owed. Beneficence,\naccording to Kant, must be tempered by respect so that we do not, for\nexample, impose burdensome obligations of gratitude on a blind person\nwho would rather navigate to the next conference session herself,\n\u201chelp\u201d a Deaf person by offering to pay for cochlear\nimplants that he does not want, finish the sentences of someone with a\nspeech impediment in ways that express condescension or pity, or\nmistake a strict duty to install a wheelchair ramp as an optional duty\nof charity (Cureton 2016, Holtman 2018).\n",
