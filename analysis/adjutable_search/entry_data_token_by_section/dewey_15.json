And while Dewey describes\nphilosophy as inherently critical, a \u201ccriticism of\ncriticisms\u201d, where does that leave even an empirical,\nhypothetical, naturalistic metaphysics? (EN, LW1: 298) Dewey\nraises the issue, prophylactically: \n\n\nAs a statement of the generic traits manifested by existences of all\nkinds without regard to their differentiation into physical and\nmental, [metaphysics] seems to have nothing to do with criticism and\nchoice, with an effective love of wisdom. (EN, LW1: 308)\n\n\nDewey answers his own question with his account of the generic traits,\none which purportedly provides \u201ca ground-map of the province of\ncriticism, establishing base lines to be employed in more intricate\ntriangulations\u201d (EN, LW1:\n 308).[18]\n New maps, new ways of looking at existence can defang old\ntruisms\u2014e.g., men are rational, women are emotional, humans are\nintelligent, animals are dumb, etc.\u2014and facilitate the creation\nof new meanings. Many of philosophy\u2019s conceptual tools (kinds,\ncategories, dualisms, aims, and values) were entrenched; a\nreconsideration of the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of\nexistents promised a basis for a new start.\n\nThe activity of metaphysical map-making fits in with the more engaged\nrole Dewey envisioned for philosophers. The philosopher would serve as\nwhat Dewey called a \u201cliaison officer\u201d, a kind of semantic\nintermediator able to help those speaking at cross purposes (or in\ndifferent jargons) to communicate more effectively (EN, LW1:\n306). Metaphysical maps draw from contemporary circumstances and\npurposes, so they would not promise certainty or permanency. Indeed,\nthe general traits \u201care actually so intimately intermixed that\nall important issues are concerned with their degrees and the ratios\nthey sustain to one another\u201d (EN, LW1: 309). Just as\nphysical maps must be redrawn based on changing needs and purposes, so\nwould metaphysical maps; in the meantime, hopefully, criticism is\nsharpened and value is more effectively secured.\n",
