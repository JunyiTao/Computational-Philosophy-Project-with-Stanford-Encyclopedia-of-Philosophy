    "main_text": "The Representation of Properties || Which Spatial Properties are Represented?\n4.2 Which Spatial Properties are Represented?\n\nMany contentful experiences represent properties as being instantiated\nat certain locations: one hears sounds as coming from certain\ndirections; one experiences pains in specific parts of the body; one\nsees different colors in different places in the scene before the\neyes. It is more controversial whether gustatory and olfactory\nexperiences represent locations. We certainly end up attributing\ntastes and odors to things in the external world, but this alone does\nnot show that the associated experiences represent any locations. (For\ndiscussion of olfactory experience see Lycan 2000, Smith 2002, ch 5,\nBatty 2010, Richardson 2013, Coveden-Taylor 2018; for discussion of\ngustatory experience see Smith ibid.) How are locations\nrepresented in experience, when they are?\n\nOne debate about the nature of representation of space concerns\nwhether the positional properties represented in visual experience are\nrelational or monadic. For discussion, see Casullo 1986.\n\nA different debate concerns which contents are best to reflect\nimportant similarities in spatial experiences. Consider an experience\nwhose contents include those that are expressed by an utterance of\n\u2018There is a red cube at location L\u2019. A simple view is that\nnothing more finely grained than location L itself is\nincluded in these contents. Peacocke (in his 1992, chapter 3)\ncriticizes this view. Suppose that the experience in the example is\nveridical, so that there really is a red cube at L, And\nsuppose L is to the left of the original perceiver, but that\nthere is a second perceiver who is seeing the same red cube, except\ngiven her position relative to the cube it is on her right. The\nexperiences differ: the perceivers see the cube as being in different\npositions relative to their bodies, and the experiences will affect\nactions of the perceivers differently, in that one would have to move\nto her right while the other will move to her left to get to the cube.\nGoing with these differences, there seems to be a phenomenal\ndifference between the experience of seeing a red cube to your left\nand seeing a red cube to your right. If the contents of experience are\nto reflect such differences, then there must be some more specific\nrepresentation of location L than is allowed by simply\nincluding the area itself in the contents. The potential problem\ndiscussed here for location suggests that the contents of experience\ninclude indexical contents of some sort.\n\nPeacocke has argued scenario contents are needed to\nadequately reflect how locations are represented in experience. A\nscenario is a spatial type, with a fixed origin in the human\nbody and axes given by directions front/back, left/right, and up/down.\nOnce the origin and axes are fixed, the scenario specifies the way the\nspace is filled in at each point-type identified by its distance and\ndirection from the origin. A positioned scenario is a\nscenario that has specific origin and axes at a specific time, and is\nthus assessable for accuracy. Positioned scenarios are supposed to\nreflect the way in which locations are represented in experience.\n\nAccording to another proposal about spatial experiences, made by\nCussins (1990), experiences of space consist in the subject\u2019s\nhaving abilities to move in certain ways. On this view, to experience\na sound as coming from the left is to know how to locate the place it\nis coming from, where this knowledge is practical knowledge about how\nto move through the environment. Having these abilities, according to\nCussins, enables the subject to form beliefs and other mental states\nthat are assessable for accuracy (or that have contents in our sense);\nbut the abilities themselves, which are supposed to constitute\nexperiences, are not; and even a creature who hadn\u2019t yet or\ncouldn\u2019t form such states could still have the abilities. To\nhave the abilities, according to Cussins, is to be presented with\nlocations in experience. In his 1990 he calls this way of being\npresented with locations construction-theoretic content\n(where this kind of \u2018content\u2019 is not assessable for\ntruth).\n\nPeacocke has objected to Cussins\u2019 construction-theoretic content\nthat there appear to be cases where subjects lack the abilities to\nmove to the locations presented in experience, for instance due to\nparalysis. Whether this objection has force depends on the notion of\n\u2018abilities\u2019; one might think the paralyzed have abilities\nthat they can\u2019t exercise.\n\nPeacocke\u2019s and Cussins\u2019 theories differ in that scenario\ncontents are assessable for accuracy and construction-theoretic\ncontents aren\u2019t, and both purport to be contents of the same\nexperiences. However, something like construction-theoretic contents\ncan be combined with scenario contents. One outstanding question for\nPeacocke\u2019s theory is how an experience comes to have scenario\ncontents, and a potential answer to this is that an experience comes\nto have the scenario contents it does by the subject\u2019s having\nthe abilities Cussins describes. More generally, the question of what\nmakes it the case that one has the experience contents one does is an\noutstanding question for many theories of content (this issue is\ndiscussed further in the\n Section 8).\n\nAnother debate about the representation of spatial properties concerns\nthe phenomenal difference between the experiences of seeing a\nfour-sided equilateral figure as a square and seeing it as a regular\ndiamond. (The example is from Mach 1914).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one version of this contrast, there are two figures differing only\nin their orientation to the viewer (on a page, the top and bottom of\nthe square is parallel with the top and bottom of the page; while the\ndiamond is just like the square except rotated 45 degrees around its\ncenter.) Assuming that the property of being a square is the same as\nthe property of being a regular diamond (an assumption defended by\nPeacocke in 1993, contested by Tye 2003, but granted by Tye 2004),\nthis appears to be a case in which there is a phenomenal difference\nwithout any difference in the properties represented. The options,\nthen, are similar to the ones listed in the discussion of the inverted\ncolor qualia: (i) deny that there is a difference in content\ncorresponding to the phenomenal difference; (ii) hold that there are\ndifferences in the way the property of being square is\nrepresented, i.e., invoke different modes of presentation of this\nproperty (Peacocke 2001a, 2001b); (iii) find some other property that\nis represented in one experience but not the other, such as the\nviewer-relative property of resting on a side, or the property having\ntwo horizontal sides (properties allegedly attributed by experience to\nthe square but not the diamond); and the property of standing on a\npoint or the property of having inclined sides (properties allegedly\nattributed by the experience to the diamond but not to the square)\n(Tye 2005). Here we have another case of a debate between Fregean and\nRussellian positions on the nature of experience content.\n\nAnother topic concerning spatial representation in experience is the\nrelation between representing locations of things, on the one hand,\nand representing things as mind-independent, on the other. According\nto some philosophers, for the case of visual experience, representing\nthings as occupying three dimensions of space suffices for\nrepresenting them as mind-independent (see Strawson 1958, Peacocke\n1983, Masrour 2011; for dissent, see Smith ch 5, and 2000). According\nto others, visual experience represents spatial locations as locations\nfrom which one could act (Schellenberg 2007).\n [2]\n\n",
