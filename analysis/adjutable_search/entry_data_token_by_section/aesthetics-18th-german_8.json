    "main_text": "Baumgarten and Meier: Aesthetics as the Analogue of Rational Cognition || Meier\n3.2 Meier\n\nBaumgarten did not extensively develop his comment that art must be\ntouching, but this became central to Meier\u2019s aesthetics. In his early\nwork on the emotions, Meier emphasized that aesthetics should deal\nwith the passions because they have a \u201cstrong influence on\nsensible cognition.\u201d His position is not just that the passions\nhave influence on sensible cognition, but that they are themselves a\ngreat source of sensible pleasure, and that it is therefore part of\nthe aim of art to arouse them. Meier analyzes the passions, in spite\nof their name (the German term Leidenschaft, like the\nLatin passio, etymologically means something that happens to\nsomeone rather than something that one does, an actio), as a\nform of mental activity: they are \u201cefforts or strivings of the\nsoul\u201d that result in a desire or an aversion, more precisely\nparticularly strong and firm desires or aversions\n(Meier, Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a727, p.  30). This might\nlead one to expect that desires and aversions can be sources of great\npleasure or displeasure, depending upon whether they are realized or\nnot, but Meier goes on to argue that \u201call emotions, the\ndisagreeable ones not excluded, produce a gratification,\u201d\nbecause they are active states or perfections of the soul, and\n\u201cwhenever the soul feels a perfection in itself, it is sensitive\nof a gratification.\u201d And because they are so strong, the\npassions, whether desires or aversions, are those among our mental\nstates that make us most aware of our own mental activity, and\ntherefore are actually the strongest source of pleasure for us:\nin the passions almost the entire lower power of\ncognition and desire is engaged, that is, almost the entire lower part\nof our soul. Thus in the emotions the soul is sensitive of the\nstrength of its powers, that is, of its perfection. It must therefore\nnecessarily be gratified with its own strength. It must be joyous when\nit feels as much as it can. (Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a789,\np. 124)\n\n\nIn another essay Meier identifies this feeling of\njoy at the activity of our own soul with the category of the\n\u201clife of cognition,\u201d and thus makes it a central source\nof our pleasure in art.\nLiving cognition becomes alive through the\nsensible representations. The lower powers of the soul, the desires\nand aversions, constitute the life of a cognition. Everything that\nleaves our powers in peace when we cognize it is a dead\ncognition. (Meier, \u201cDa\u00df das Wesen der Dichtkunst in unserer\nNatur gegr\u00fcndet ist\u201d (\u201cThat the essence of poetry is\ngrounded in our nature\u201d), in Meier, Fr\u00fche Schriften,\nPart 3, pp. 160\u20134, at p. 162)\n\n\nArt aims for the opposite. Indeed, Meier\ncontinues that it is by arousing our passions that art achieves its\ngoal of a clear but confused, that is, manifold but densely packed,\ncognition. For Meier, moving our emotions is not just some small part\nof the beauty of art, as Baumgarten seems to suggest. Instead, the\narousal of our emotions, even ones that considered by themselves\nshould be disagreeable, is the strongest source of the pleasure at\nwhich art aims because it is the most intense form of mental\nactivity.\n\n\nMeier thus departed from the strictly cognitivist aesthetics of Wolff\nand connected what he had learned from Baumgarten with the passionate\naesthetics of the French Abb\u00e9 Du Bos. With his connection of the\npleasure in experiencing emotions to the pleasure of experiencing\nmental activity as such he brought Wolffian aesthetics a step closer\nto contemporary British aesthetics. Meier thereby prepared the way for\nthe tremendous influence that British aesthetics would have in Germany\nby the end of the 1750s. But while Meier stressed\nthe activity of the mind and Baumgarten argued that aesthetic\nexperience is based in an analogue of reason, not reason itself,\nneither was quite ready to introduce the idea of the free\nplay of our mental powers as the fundamental source of our\npleasure in aesthetic experience. Baumgarten mentions play once, but\nonly to recommend that children be allowed to play in order to develop\ntheir cognitive powers, not as the fundamental source of mature\naesthetic pleasure (Poppe, \u00a755, p. 102). Baumgarten also at least\nonce characterizes the mental state of aesthetic experience as a form\nof harmony: he says that the \u201caestheticodogmatic\u201d thinker\n(by which he means a thinker aiming to express a true doctrine\naesthetically )\nshould in his striving for truth put that before\nthe eyes of his audience the truth of which he has known with\ncertitude and which can be represented in its aesthetic truth on the\nbasis of the harmony between the upper and lower faculties of\ncognition. ( Aesthetica, \u00a7573; Schweizer, pp.\n254\u20135)\n\n\nBut the occurrence of this comment in the context\nof Baumgarten\u2019s discussion of aesthetic truth (or of how truths can\nbe presented in ways agreeable to the senses) makes clear that with\nthis reference to \u201charmony\u201d between the lower and upper\nfaculties of cognition he is not quite introducing the idea of\na free play between them. That idea would be decisively\nintroduced into German aesthetics only with Kant\u2019s unique synthesis\nof the preceding German tradition with the British tradition. Before\nthat was to happen, however, the ideas, emphasized more by Meier\nalthough already suggested by Baumgarten, that art aims at arousing\nour emotions and at the pleasurable activity of the mind, and at the\nformer as an instance of the latter, would be further developed by an\nintervening generation of German thinkers. Let us now turn to some of\nthose.\n",
