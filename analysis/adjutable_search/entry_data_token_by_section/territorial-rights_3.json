    "main_text": "Theories of Territory in Historical Perspective\n2. Theories of Territory in Historical Perspective\n\nThere are a number of historical theories which have presented\narguments about territory that have been relatively neglected in the\nscholarship on these theories, which has tended to focus on other\naspects of their argument. Three key traditions are the natural law\ntradition, in particular Grotius and Pufendorf; the social contract\ntradition, and particularly Locke, who offered a theory of political\nobligation and a justification for limited constitutional government;\nand the justice tradition, associated with Kant, which identifies the\nstate with the achievement of justice. None of these offered a\ncomplete theory of territory, but they did, in the course of\ntheorizing the state and the international order, connect territory in\ncrucial ways to their overall argument, such that it is extremely\nuseful to focus on how they conceptualized territory, how they argued\nfor it, and how it was related to other key elements in their\npolitical theory. Contemporary theories, which will be discussed in\nsect. 3, mainly build on these earlier theories.\n",
