From the\nperspective of virtue epistemology, Linda Zagzebski claimed that if we\nthink of an intellectual virtue as an \u201cexcellence of the\nmind\u201d, attuned to a variety of epistemic goods, then there is\nsomething one-sided about focusing attention only on the good of\nknowledge, while neglecting other highly prized goods such as\nunderstanding and wisdom (see especially Zagzebski 1996: 43\u201350;\n2001). Finally, Jonathan Kvanvig forcefully argued that while\nunderstanding is distinctively valuable from an epistemic point of\nview\u2014i.e., more valuable than any of its proper parts, such as\ntruth, or justification, or a combination of the two\u2014knowledge\nis not (Kvanvig 2003). For all these thinkers, the spotlight of\nconcern within epistemology needed to be broadened so that goods such\nas understanding could be given their proper due, and their claims\nresonated with other epistemologists (for overviews, see Gordon 2017;\nHannon forthcoming).\n\nWhile the notion of understanding was often simply neglected in\nepistemology, in the philosophy of science it was for many years\nactively downplayed. A primary figure in this dynamic was Carl Hempel\n(see especially Hempel 1965). Although Hempel helped bring the notion\nof explanation back into respectability in the philosophy of science,\nhe had significant reservations about tying explanation too closely to\nthe notion of understanding.\n\nPart of this seemed to stem from the fact that the idea of\nunderstanding that prevailed in his day was highly subjective and\npsychological\u2014it emphasized more a subjective\n\u201csense\u201d of understanding, often tied to a felt sense of\nfamiliarity. As Hempel notes, however, poor explanations might excel\nalong this dimension because they might\n\n\ngive the questioner a sense of having attained some understanding;\nthey may resolve his perplexity and in this sense \u201canswer\u201d\nhis question.\n\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, he continues,\n\n\nhowever satisfactory these answers may be psychologically, they are\nnot adequate for the purposes of science, which, after all, is\nconcerned to develop a conception of the world that has a clear,\nlogical bearing on our experience and is thus capable of objective\ntest. (Hempel 1966: 47\u201348)\n\n\nThe goodness of an explanation therefore seems to have little obvious\nconnection to whether it manages to generate understanding in a\nparticular audience. A good explanation might do that. But then again,\nit might not. Patently poor explanations are also able to generate a\nrich \u201csense\u201d of understanding in some audiences (think of\nconspiracy theorists), despite their shortcomings.\n\nPhilosophers such as Michael Friedman responded to Hempel\u2019s\nconcerns by noting that simply because there seems to be a\npsychological element to understanding it does not follow that\nunderstanding is merely subjective or up for grabs (Friedman 1974).\nAfter all, knowledge has a psychological element, in light of the\nbelief condition, but few hold that knowledge is merely subjective or\nup for grabs. Others, such as Jaegwon Kim, argued that leaving\nconsiderations about understanding out of accounts of explanation was\ndeeply mistaken (Kim 1994 [2010]). After all, Kim claimed, we desire\nto explain things because we want to understand them.\n\nDespite the efforts of Friedman, Kim, and others, significant\nreservations about the notion of understanding continued to linger in\nthe philosophy of science (see, for example, Trout 2002). A notable\nshift occurred with Henk de Regt\u2019s distinction between the\n\u201cfeeling\u201d or phenomenology of understanding and genuine\nunderstanding (de Regt 2004, 2009: ch. 1; cf. de Regt and Dieks 2005).\nIn particular, he argued that the feeling is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for genuine understanding. De Regt\u2019s important\ndistinction helped pave the way for a new surge of work on the topic\nover the last two decades, and helped philosophers move beyond\nthinking of understanding mainly in terms of felt\n\u201caha!\u201d or \u201ceureka!\u201d\nexperiences.\n",
