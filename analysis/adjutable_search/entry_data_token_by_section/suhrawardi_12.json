    "main_text": "Suhrawardi\u2019s Legacy || Post-Suhrawardian Traditions\n6.1 Post-Suhrawardian Traditions\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s tragic end marked the beginning of a long history\nof commentaries by both proponents and detractors of his novel\nreassessment of the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition. By the end of the\n13th century, at least two of his works were readily\navailable and studied in the major centers of learning of Syria\n(Damascus and Aleppo), Iraq (Baghdad) and Iran (Maraghah), some of\nwhich circulating most probably before his death. Two major trends\nwithin the commentarial tradition of the 13th century were\nto shape later developments: one wass exemplified by Ibn Kammuna\n(d.1284) who emphasizes the \u201cpurely discursive and the more\nsystematically philosophical\u201d aspects of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nworks, and the other was exemplified by Shahrazuri (d.ca.1288) who\nfocuses on, and expands the symbolic and the allegorical aspects of\nwhat came to be known as the ishraqi tradition (Ziai 2003,\n473\u201387). \n\nIbn Kammuna, a Jewish philosopher greatly influenced by both Avicenna\nand Suhrawardi, is the first commentator (Langermann 2005,\n297\u2013301; Pourjavady and Schmidtke 2006, 23\u201332; Eichner\n2010) who, while in Baghdad, completes in 1268 his commentary on the\nlogic, physics and the metaphysics of Intimations (Ibn\nKammuna 2003, 2009). Having resided in Aleppo, he could well be, with\nsuch works as The Revealer, completed in 1278 (2008;\nLangermann 2005), the link between Suhrawardi and Shahrazuri who\nwrites the earliest commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (ca. 1286), after having written a commentary on\nIntimations (Shahrazuri 1993; cf. Marcotte 2002).\nShahrazuri\u2019s encyclopedic Metaphysical Tree, also\nwritten before his commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shahrazuri, 2004 and 2005 [a better edition]),\nwould contain some ishraqi elements, although it remains to\nbe ascertained whether his Divine Symbols and Proverbs does\n(Privot\n 2004).[2]\n\nMore work is needed to determine the extent and the nature of\nShahrazuri\u2019s contribution to what came to be known as an\n\u2018Illuminationist\u2019 tradition. Van Lit (2017, 79\u2013112)\nprovides a good example of how focussing on a particular doctrinal\nelement can yield much insight into Shahrazuri\u2019s contribution,\nnamely giving expression and stabalising the name of the \u2018world\nof images\u2019, its location and topography, the means to access it,\nits reality, etc. (see also Marcotte 2001b, 2002). In 1295, Qutb\nal-Din Shirazi completes his own commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shirazi 2001; Suh. 1986), which supplanted\nShahrazuri\u2019s commentary (Walbridge 1992). \n\nAuthors that incorporated or commented and discussed isharaqi\nideas include (Isma\u2018il ibn) Muhammad Ibn Rizi (fl.ca.1280), in\nhis Life of Souls (Marcotte 2004); Athir al-Din al-Abhari\n(d.1242) in a number of his works (Eichner 2012); \u2018Allamah Hilli\n(d.1325), who pens a commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (now lost), and solutions to issues raised in\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Intimations (completed before 1293) and\nOpposites; Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani (d.1414) writes a\ncommentary on the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132); Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa\u2019i (d.1501) (Schmidtke 2000);\nNajm al-Din Mahmud al-Nayrizi (d.ca.1526), a critic of Suhrawardi,\ncompletes in 1526 his commentary on Tablets to \u2018Imad\n(Pourjavady 2011, 131\u20136, 137\u201352); the two theologians\nJalal al-Din al-Dawani (d.1501) and Ghiyath al-Din al-Dashtaki\n(d.1542) write commentaries on his Temples of Light (Dawani\n1953; Dashtaki 2003; Suh. 1996); and \u2018Abd al-Razzaq (Fayyaz)\nLahiji (d.1667), one of Mulla Sadra\u2019s students, would have also\nwritten a commentary on Temples of Light. \n\nMulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi) (d.1636), who was most interested\nin Suhrawardi\u2019s critique of Avicennan Peripateticism (existence\nas a being of reason, the Platonic forms, knowledge by presence,\neschatology), writes marginal glosses on the Philosophy of\nIllumination and on Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi\u2019s commentary on\nthe work (Mulla Sadra 2010; cf. Suh. 1986; Landolt 2017). Mulla Sadra,\nlike Hadi Sabzawari (d.1873), upholds the principality of existence\n(wujud), in opposition to what he understood to be\nSuhrawardi\u2019s view that quiddity was primary over existence, a\nview shared by Mir Damad (d.1631) (cf. his Spiritual\nAttractions [2001] and Divine Embers [2001]). \n\nDuring the same period, Suhrawardi\u2019s works enter the Turkish\nOttoman and Persian Indian philosophical traditions. In the Ottoman\nworld, Isma\u2018il Ankaravi (d.1631), a member of the Mevlevi Sufi\norder, translates and comments Temples of Light in his\nElucidation of Wisdoms (Kuspinar 1996). During the\n17th century, the enigmatic Ahmad Ibn al-Harawi (probably\nfrom Herat), who lived in the Indian subcontinent, translates the\nPhilosophy of Illumination into Persian on which he writes a\ncommentary (Harawi 1979). Azar Kayvan (d.ca.1615), a Zoroastrian high\npriest from Fars, who emigrated to Gujurat in Mughal India during the\nreign of Emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605), starts a Zoroastrian\nishraqi school (Walbridge 2001, 91\u20133). Muhammad\n\u2018Ali Hazin Lahiji (d.1667) writes a commentary on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Words of Sufism (Suh. 2001, 101\u201339;\n1993d), along with glosses and notes on three other of his works,\nincluding the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132). Even thinkers of the 20th century, such as\nMuhammad Kazim \u2018Assar (d.1975) and his discussion of\n\u201cequivocal being\u201d, have been influenced by\nishraqielements (Ziai 2003, 472). Van Lit provides a\nchronological sketch of eighteen commentators on Suhrawardi, including\nlesser-known ones (2018, 548\u201353). Cataloguing and making\naccessible hundreds of philosophical works in Arabic and Persian from\nthe 12th\u201319th century, like the recent\npublication of the Persian Inner Light (2012) of Shihab\nal-Din Kumijani (d.1895), are bound to shed new light on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s legacy. \n\nAlthough very little has been written on the history of the\nphilosophical legacy of Suhrawardi\u2019s novel ishraqi\nideas and doctrines, how is one to understand claims made about the\nexistence of a truly original and distinct \u2018Illuminationist\ntradition\u2019? Some are more cautious in their assessment of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s project and legacy. Van Lit (2017, 2\u20133,\n6\u20137), for example, questions Corbin and others who have deemed\nwhat is often labelled the \u2018Illuminationist\u2019 or\nisraqi tradition a \u2018school of thought\u2019, and offer\na corrective assessment with his detailed study on the notion of\n\u2013 suspended images \u2013 and the \u2018world of image\u2019.\nLandolt (2008, 235) also nuanced such claims, like those of Ziai\namongst others, regarding the existence of a truly Suhrawardian\n\u2018Illuninationist\u2019 tradition conceived as a philosohpical\n(hikma) system radically different from Avicenna\u2019s\nPeripateticism. Suhrawardi\u2019s project needs to be recast as a\ncritique of the latter\u2019s brand of Peripateticism, similar to the\nvarious critiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and\nal-Ghazali(d.1111), etc. \n",
