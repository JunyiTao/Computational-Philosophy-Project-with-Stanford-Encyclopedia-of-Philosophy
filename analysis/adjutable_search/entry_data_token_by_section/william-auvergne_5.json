    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || God as the Source of Being\n6.1 God as the Source of Being\n\nAccording to William, everything participates in or acquires its being\nfrom God. But just what he means by this is less than clear. At times,\nas in the following passage from On the Universe, he seems to\nsuggest that God is literally present in created things as their\nbeing:\n\nthe creator is next to and most present to each of his creatures; in\nfact, he is most interior to each of them. And this can be seen by you\nthrough the subtraction or stripping away of all the accidental and\nsubstantial conditions and forms. For when you subtract from each of\nthe creatures all these, last of all there is found being or entity,\nand on this account its giver. (OO I, 625b; Teske 1998a, 100)\n\n\nYet William realizes that such statements may give an incorrect\nimpression of his thought. Thus, at one point in On the\nUniverse he writes that \u201cevery substance includes, if\nit is proper to say so (si dici fas est), the\ncreator\u2019s essence within itself\u201d (OO I, 920b), and he goes\non to note that it is difficult to state clearly the sense in which\nthe creator is in creatures. In other passages he emphasizes\nGod\u2019s transcendence of creatures: \u201cthe first being\n(esse) is for all things the being (esse) by which\nthey are \u2026 It is one essence, pure, solitary, separate from and\nunmixed with all things.\u201d Often he appeals to an analogy with\nlight: the first being fills \u201call things like light cast over\nthe universe. By this filling or outpouring it makes all things\nreflect it. This is their being (esse), namely to reflect\nit\u201d (Switalski 1976, 45; Teske and Wade 1989, 89). William\nperhaps intends in such remarks to exploit the medieval view that a\npoint of light (lux) and the light emitted from that point\n(lumen), though distinct, nonetheless are also in some deep\nsense the same.\n",
