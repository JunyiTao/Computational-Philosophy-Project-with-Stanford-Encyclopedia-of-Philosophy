Historical Background: Philosophical and Scientific\n\nUndoubtedly, the growth and development of molecular biology over the\npast half century has made reductionism in biology a central issue\n(and DNA a household word). However, it would be wrong to assume that\ndifferent aspects of reductionism only gain traction in the wake of\nthe molecularization of biology juxtaposed with discussions of\nreduction from a logical empiricist perspective (see\n Section 3.1).\n Besides a perennial concern with what makes\n life\n distinctive (Riskin 2018), we can distinguish at least two\nreductionist themes throughout history relevant to the life sciences\nand its philosophy: (1) the relation among different branches or\ndomains of knowledge and (2) the relation between\n parts and wholes\n (Grene and Depew 2004, Magner 1994). These two themes link up in a\ncomplex fashion with both epistemic and ontological reduction.\n(Questions about methodological reduction tend to coalesce around new\ntechnologies that open up the possibility of pursuing reductionist\nresearch methods, such as making observations at a lower level with\nmicroscopy.) Additionally, these themes arise in the context of\nspecific domains of enduring interest: (a) the complex relations among\ndifferent animals and plants in natural environments, i.e.,\n\u201cecology\u201d, (b) the integrated relations among the parts\nand whole of an organism, i.e., \u201cphysiology/functional\nanatomy\u201d, and (c) the dynamic relations among the homogeneous\ncomponents in the early stages of an embryo that eventually beget a\nunified whole organism containing heterogeneous parts in appropriate\narrangement and connection, i.e.,\n\u201cdevelopment/reproduction\u201d.\n\nAristotle\n is the foundation for both philosophical themes pertaining to\nreductionism. He addressed the relationship between domains of\nscientific knowledge in his concepts of superordinate and subordinate\nsciences (Posterior Analytics I). Each science has a\ndistinctive subject genus, first principles, and a set of predicates\nthat are commensurable with the subject genus (McKirahan 1978, 1992,\nch. 4\u20135). Though the relations among sciences are systematic,\nthey are not necessarily reductive because there is no most\nfundamental science. These connections are relevant to relations\nbetween parts and wholes because Aristotle utilized his science of\nelements and their potentials (e.g., as seen in On Generation and\nCorruption and Meteorology) to inform his description\nand analysis of organism components in the History of Animals\nand Parts of Animals. He treated three compositional\n\u201clevels\u201d: elements and their potentials; uniform parts\nsuch as blood and bone; and, non-uniform parts that include multiple\nuniform parts, such as the face or hands. The primary domain here is\nphysiology/functional anatomy but development/reproduction is always\nin view and addressed directly in the Generation of Animals.\nClaims about \u201cpotentials\u201d are buttressed by an account of\ntheir contributions to material properties composing uniform parts\n(Meteorology IV; see Lennox 2001, ch. 8, Popa 2005). Complex\ndispositions (e.g., the fleshy, sinuous elasticity of the esophagus)\nare postulated from these material substrates that have relevance to,\nbut do not determine the nature of, these organismal parts because\nfunctional strictures ultimately govern them (the fleshy, sinuous\nelasticity of the esophagus is for the sake of repeated\ndilation during food ingestion).\n\nThe\n teleological\n orientation of Aristotle\u2019s biology means that he is often\ncharacterized as an ontological anti-reductionist (e.g., the elemental\npotentials of lower levels of organization are for the sake of but do\nnot determine the uniform parts at higher levels of organization).\nThis blends with epistemic issues related to particular domains, such\nas his rejection of Presocratic materialist (i.e., purely\n\u201cmechanistic\u201d) explanations for the origin of animal\nmorphology during development. (Empedocles apparently claimed that\nvertebrae arise during ontogeny solely as a consequence of a unified\ncylindrical column physically breaking into the observable iterated\nunits of the backbone; see Parts of Animals I.1\n[640a].) Yet Aristotle was attentive to issues of material\ncomposition and constraints arising from the nature of properties\nexhibited by animal parts, which often mark commitments to types of\nontological and epistemic reduction. His concept of hypothetical\nnecessity (Physics II; see Cooper 1987) permitted the use of\none kind of material in many different organismal parts.\n Galen,\n among many others subsequent to Aristotle, also explored these\nissues, whether from the perspective of how material complexes\ngenerate higher level properties (Mixtures) or the relations\namong parts and wholes in the context of development (The\nConstruction of the Embryo).\n\nIn the early modern period, William Harvey adopted an Aristotelian\nstance in the context of both physiology and development (Lennox 2006,\n2017). The relation between parts and wholes in ontogeny, including\nrelevant material properties, is constantly in view (Harvey 1981\n[1651]). Although Harvey used \u201cmechanistic\u201d analogies,\nreferring to the motion of the heart in terms of interlocking gears or\nto the heart itself as a pump (Distelzweig 2016),\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n famously disputed Harvey\u2019s claims from the perspective of the\n \u201cmechanical philosophy\u201d.\n Descartes sought to explain the movement of the heart not in terms of\nfunction but rather by appeal only to the matter in motion composing\nthe circulating blood that is heated and thus expands akin to\nfermentation (Description of the Human Body). He also\nattempted to explain embryology in terms of matter and motion alone;\ne.g., tissue and organ origination is accounted for via matter slowing\ndown and aggregating in different regions of the embryo (Des Chene\n2001, ch. 2, Smith 2006, Part II).\n Robert Boyle\n defended teleological explanations in anatomy and physiology\n(specifically, the integrated relations among the parts and whole of\nan organism) by laying out how they were compatible with and supported\nby mechanistic explanations (Lennox 1983). Thus, he offered a version\nof epistemic reduction in line with his conception of mechanical\nphilosophy, which included a heterogeneous methodology (reductionist\nand non-reductionist) and concomitant reservations about ontological\nreduction.\n Baruch Spinoza\n famously used the image of a worm in a bloodstream to engage the\ntheme of part-whole relations and their complexity in a 1665 letter to\nHenry\n Oldenburg.[3]\n More broadly, the emergence of distinctive scientific approaches to\nliving phenomena in the 18th century involved constant debate over\nwhether organisms were composed of \u201cactive\u201d matter or\nenergized by an animating element, distinct from non-living entities,\nsuch that their resistance to decay could be accounted for by a\n\u201cvital materialism\u201d (Zammito 2018).\n\nImmanuel Kant\n explicitly articulated a dialectic between a teleological outlook on\norganismal functioning (including ecological relationships,\nphysiology, and development specifically) and a mechanistic\nunderstanding of causation modeled on Newtonian mechanics\n(Critique of Judgment, Part II; see Mensch 2013, Zuckert\n2010). Kant\u2019s maintenance of this tension between the reciprocal\ncausal relations of parts in an organism (\u201cteleology\u201d) and\nthe linear-mechanical causality justified within his critical\nphilosophy was a way of splitting apart epistemological and\nmetaphysical issues. It has elements of epistemic anti-reductionism\n(organismal processes must be understood in terms of their reciprocal\ncontribution to a systemic goal\u2014an epistemological subordination\nof mechanism to teleology) and ontological reductionism (all causation\nis ultimately linear-mechanical). But Kant also understood\nlinear-mechanical causation as a category by which the mind frames\nexperiences of the world. Thus, his understanding of metaphysics\ndiffers from the realist one underlying most contemporary accounts of\nontological reduction. In addition to the theme of reductive relations\nbetween parts and wholes, Kant also addressed relations among\ndifferent scientific domains in his discussion of sciences having\ntheir own distinct concepts and subject matter (Critique of\nJudgment, \u00a768, 79).\n\nKant\u2019s work was influential among those studying biological\nphenomena, even if misinterpreted in various ways, and helped frame\nthe question of teleology versus mechanism in the early 19th century\n(Lenoir 1982, Zammito 2012). His discussion stressed the significance\nof methodological conclusions\u2014it is necessary (a maxim or\nregulative principle) to take organisms as natural purposes if we are\nto investigate them scientifically. This encouraged speculations about\nnew forces, akin to those found in Newtonian mechanics, which would\nexplain biological phenomena \u201cmechanistically\u201d (e.g., the\nformative force explaining embryonic development; see Look 2006,\nRichards 2000). The Newtonian inspiration survived, with or without\nKantian traces, well into the 19th century and beyond. Comparative\nanatomy (conceptualized broadly to include functional anatomy and\nembryology) exploited methodological suggestions from successful\nphysical science. For example, Geoffroy St. Hilaire appealed to\nNewton\u2019s musings that animals are governed by similar principles\nor laws as those found in mechanics (Le Guyader 2004). More typical is\nRichard Owen\u2019s discussion of matter and its properties within\nliving organisms, where he exhibits a clear anti-reductionist stance\nand postulates something akin to emergent\n properties.[4]\n This perspective was shared by many comparative anatomists who used\nan \u201canalysis:synthesis\u201d style of reasoning (Elwick 2007).\nA related strand regarding reductionism winds its way through\nphysiological investigations of the 19th century. Here the Cartesian\nmechanical-reductionist program is rejoined with an emphasis on the\nanimal machine (Canguilhem in Delaporte 1994, ch. 5, 8, 10, 12,\nColeman 1977, ch. 6). Despite clear metaphysical commitments to a form\nof ontological reduction, methodological types of reductionism were\nqualified because of their impact on experimental design (e.g.,\nBernard 1957 [1865]). Overall, there was a diversity of mechanist\n(\u201creductionist\u201d) and organicist\n(\u201cnon-reductionist\u201d) positions corresponding to\nontological, epistemic, and methodological types of reduction in the\n19th century, similar to the philosophical diversity observable today\n(see Sections\n 3\n and\n 5\n below).\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the topic of development\nreturned with a vengeance in the controversy over vitalism (sometimes\ntermed \u201corganicism\u201d) (Normandin and Wolfe 2013). A general\nmovement towards more mechanistic or materialistic interpretations of\nliving systems was emerging at this time (e.g., Loeb 1912, cf. Allen\n1975) and disagreements about explaining development loomed large\n(Maienschein 1991). However, the famous example of vitalism in Hans\nDriesch\u2019s interpretation of development and the autonomy of the\norganism should be seen as an issue of epistemology as much as\nmetaphysics (Maienschein 2000). Instead of materialism versus vitalism\n(i.e., ontological reduction questions), the explanatory conflict\ninvolved the nature of differentiation in early ontogeny and to what\ndegree it is prespecified. The theme of order and organization in\nliving systems pervades many writings about methodological,\nepistemological, and ontological types of reductionism at this time\n(emphasizing both relations between physics and biology and between\nparts and wholes) (Esposito 2014, Peterson 2016). Examples include\nJoseph Needham\u2019s Order and Life (1936), Kurt\nGoldstein\u2019s The Organism (1934/1963), E.S.\nRussell\u2019s The Interpretation of Development and\nHeredity (1930), D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2019s On Growth and\nForm (1917), Ludwig von Bertalanffy\u2019s Modern Theories\nof Development (1933), and J.H. Woodger\u2019s Biological\nPrinciples (1929). Philosophers of science who have had less\ninfluence on contemporary Anglo-American philosophy were keenly aware\nof these discussions. For example,\n Ernst Cassirer\n (1950, Part II) explored reductionist themes related to causal\nexplanations of development, including the debates about mechanism and\nvitalism surrounding Driesch, as well as the relations between\nphysical science and biology. These topics also appeared in the pages\nof Philosophy of Science (e.g., Lillie 1934, 1942, 1948,\nSinger 1934, 1946), although not necessarily utilizing the specific\nterminology of reduction (Byron 2007).\n\nErnest Nagel\u2019s general treatment of reductionism in chapters 11\nand 12 of The Structure of Science (1961) canvassed many\ndifferent aspects of these perennial debates (Sarkar 2015). Whereas\nthe sections concerning theory reduction have usually been in view\n(connecting with the reductionist theme of relating domains of\nknowledge), Nagel also interacted with biological literature\naddressing claims about parts, wholes, and emergence, thereby\naddressing the second reductionist theme that has been prominent since\nAristotle (see Nagel 1961, 366ff). He highlighted the polysemy of\n\u201cwholes\u201d, \u201cparts\u201d, and \u201csums\u201d\ninherent in claims about success or failure in showing that the whole\nis just the sum of its parts (pp. 380ff). Additionally Nagel treats\nthe question of evolutionary emergence, i.e., whether genuinely new\nentities arise in the history of our universe and life on Earth (see\nGoudge 1961). He dealt with the aforementioned theoretical biologists\n(e.g., Bertalanffy, Russell, and Woodger) on the topic of hierarchical\norganization and reduction in living systems, especially as seen in\nontogeny (Nagel 1961, pp. 432ff). Nagel\u2019s contemporaries\nlikewise treated reductionist themes, though their work has largely\nbeen overlooked (e.g., Morton Beckner\u2019s discussion of\n\u201corganization\u201d and \u201clevels of analysis\u201d as\nmethodological and explanatory aspects of reduction; Beckner 1959, ch.\n9).\n\nDespite Nagel\u2019s wide-ranging analysis, most subsequent\nphilosophical discussion has concentrated on his formal account of\ntheory reduction (see\n Section 3.1),\n and whether it serves as an adequate general characterization of\nreductionism for all areas of scientific\n inquiry.[5]\n The biological case that has received the most scrutiny is the\nrelationship between classical and molecular genetics, in part because\nthe molecularization of genetics was palpable in this historical\nperiod (Schaffner 1969). The manifold difficulties encountered in\napplying Nagelian theory reduction to genetics (see\n Section 4)\n encouraged the growth of\n philosophy of biology\n as an independent disciplinary specialty, in part because these\ndifficulties seemed to fit a recurring pattern\u2014misconstruing\nbiological reasoning with philosophical accounts of science forged on\nphysical science examples (Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011).\nPhilosophical issues in biology seemed to require distinct analyses\nthat are more sensitive to empirical research in biology (Brigandt\n2011). Additionally, the rise of\n sociobiology\n and\n gene-centered\n evolutionary explanations provoked anti-reductionist stances among\nbiologists on the basis of social and political commitments (e.g.,\nLevins and Lewontin 1985).\n\nMore recent attention to reductionism in situ within\ndifferent life science contexts has led many philosophers to revisit\nthe perennial aspects of reductionism, many of which were simply\ntangential to controversies over theory reduction. A number of current\ndebates are unconscious returns to neglected issues, albeit in\ndifferent ways and in different contexts. That developmental biology\nhas returned to the center of discussions is not surprising because of\nits enduring status as a biological topic inviting reflection on\nreductionist themes. The same can be said for ecology and functional\nanatomy, although they remain more peripheral for many philosophers.\nSocially and politically tinged aspects of reductionist research in\nbiology, such as racial categorizations based on genetic profiles,\nalso continue to provoke philosophical analyses (see\n Section 5).\n",
