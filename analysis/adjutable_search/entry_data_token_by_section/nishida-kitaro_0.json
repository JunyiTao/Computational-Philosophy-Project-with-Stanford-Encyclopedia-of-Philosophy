    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nNishida was born on May 19, 1870 in the village of Unoke on the Sea of\nJapan just north of the city of Kanazawa. His birthplace, later incorporated into the town of Kahoku, is the site today of archives and a monumental museum, perhaps the world\u2019s largest architectural structure dedicated to a single philosopher. Nishida grew up in the early years of the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), when Japan had reopened to the world after\ntwo and a half centuries of relative isolation and was undergoing a\nrevolutionary Europeanization of its political, educational and\ncultural institutions. As it touched Nishida\u2019s early years, this\n\u201cmodernization\u201d came in the form of both a rigid, often\noppressive school atmosphere that demanded obeisance to the emperor,\nand a liberating exposure to the progressive ideas of the Japanese\n\u201cEnlightenment\u201d that had introduced Western philosophy to\nJapan. In high school in Kanazawa he studied Chinese Confucian,\nNeo-Confucian and Daoist classics, learned to read English and German,\nexcelled in mathematics, and attempted briefly to penetrate works of\nHegel and Kant. He formed a life-long friendship with fellow student\nD.T. Suzuki, and with him dropped out of high school in 1890. Admitted\ninto Tokyo Imperial University as a \u201climited status\u201d\nstudent the following year, Nishida studied Kant, Hegel and\nSchopenhauer under the first philosophy professors in Japan. After\ngraduating in 1894 with a thesis on Hume\u2019s theory of causation, he\nmarried and held teaching positions at several provincial high schools\nand universities. During the next decade, despite the demands of\nfamily life and teaching German among other subjects, he published a\nfew philosophical essays, but was more intent on formal meditation\npractice under Zen masters in Kyoto. He began composing what later appeared as An Inquiry\ninto the Good in 1905 and on the basis of that work secured a\nposition at Kyoto Imperial University in 1910, becoming Professor of\nPhilosophy there in 1914.\n\n\nNishida concentrated on the philosophical books that made their way\ninto Japan and for the next decade wrote numerous essays that\nreworked ideas from the Neo-Kantians, Royce, Bergson, Hermann Lotze\nand, to a lesser extent, Husserl. These essays were collected into\nbooks that investigated a wide range of topics, including art and\nmorality, from the perspective of a theory of consciousness and the\nwill. Nishida\u2019s fame began to spread in the 1920s.  He was\ninstrumental in securing positions at Kyoto University for Tanabe\nHajime, Watsuji Tetsur\u014d, and Kuki Shuz\u014d, and attracted\nstudents such as Nishitani Keiji, Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, who all\nbecame significant philosophers in Japan. He developed his signature\ntheory of place (basho) in the mid 1920s, and continued to\nelaborate it after he became professor emeritus and moved to Kamakura\nin 1929. In the early 1930s his interests turned to the nature of\nhuman actions and interactions in the historical and social world, and\neventually to the meaning of culture and nationhood.\n\n\nBecause of his prestige as Japan\u2019s premier philosopher, government\nofficials\u2014among them his former student and then Prime Minister\nKonoe Fumimaro\u2014appealed to him to justify Japanese\nnationalism. Nishida complied by addressing the issues, if not\nlegitimizing Japan\u2019s expansionism and imperialism. Yet he considered much of that work\na distraction. He lectured on \u201cThe Problem of Japanese\nCulture\u201d in 1938; when published two years later the book quickly sold\nsome 60,000 copies. He delivered an invited address to the emperor in\n1941 that advocated academic freedom and a place for each nation in\nthe global world, with each developing its own global\n perspective.[1]\n Addresses on the \u201cPrinciples for the New World Order\u201d and\non \u201cThe Body (or Essence) of the Nation\u201d (kokutai)\nfollowed. During this time Nishida\u2019s critics on the right considered\nhis political writings either too abstract or insufficiently\nsupportive of the government; his leftist critics, especially after the Second World War,\nfound them profusely nationalistic. Despite his failing health\nand the bombing of cities all around him, Nishida persisted in his\nphilosophical investigations, using for example Descartes\u2019 Cogito and Leibniz\u2019s\nPreestablished Harmony as points of departure. He\ncompleted the seminal essay, \u201cThe Logic of Place and the\nReligious Worldview,\u201d just two months before his death on June 7,\n1945. Publication of his collected works in 19 volumes began two years\nlater. An extant photograph shows dozens of people camped out all\nnight long awaiting the issue of the first volume on July 20,\n1947.\n\n\nNishida\u2019s private life, reflected only faintly in his philosophical\nwork, nevertheless left its stamp on its tenor. His perseverance\nthrough turmoil explains perhaps some of the intensity of his\nwriting. Comprehending reality for him was an emotive as well as\nintellectual achievement; his calligraphy and poetry, renowned in\ntheir own right, evince an acute awareness of transience and\ntranscendence.  Nishida experienced the death of his first wife and\nfour of his eight children; upon the passing of his first son he wrote\nthis waka poem:\n\n\nHaving lived\nhealthily\ntill twenty-three\nhow could he disappear\nlike a dream\n\n\n(Yusa 2002, 314\u201318).\n\n\n\nThree years later he was able to write\n\n\nThe bottom of my soul has such depth;\nNeither joy nor the waves of sorrow can reach it\n\n\n(Nishida 1958, frontispiece, trans. by Robert Schinzinger).\n\n",
