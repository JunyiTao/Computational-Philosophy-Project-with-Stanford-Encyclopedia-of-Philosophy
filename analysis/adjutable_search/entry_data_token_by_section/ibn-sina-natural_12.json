    "main_text": "Conditions for Motion\n4. Conditions for Motion\n\nAgain physics is the study of bodies insofar as they are subject to\nmotion. We have just seen Avicenna\u2019s account of motion and\nbefore that considered his views about bodies and magnitude more\ngenerally. A discussion of Avicenna\u2019s treatment of certain\nnecessary conditions associated with motion and moving bodies is now\nin order. These necessary conditions are, one, how to identify the\nplace of a body and, two, the time required for motion.\n",
