    "main_text": "\n\n\nProclus of Athens (*412\u2013485 C.E.) was the most authoritative\nphilosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the\ntransmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages.\nFor almost fifty years, he was head or \u2018successor\u2019\n(diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic\n\u2018Academy\u2019 in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive\nwriter, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato,\nsystematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at\nthat time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics,\nethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom\n(Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on\nthe development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens,\nbut also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of\nthe school.  In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic\nphilosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions\nof wisdom.  Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus\n(4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and\nfollowing the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate\nthe harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of\nHomer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and\nto integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and\nPlato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology\noffers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic\ntheology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus\u2019\nphilosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly\ncommentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into\nthe Neoplatonic metaphysical system.\n",
