    "main_text": "\n\nDom Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) was an early defender and\nteacher of the Cartesian philosophy at St. Maur in the region of\nLorraine, France. He was born in Ancemont and in 1636 became a monk in\nthe Benedictine order. He taught theology at Saint-Evre at Toul\nbetween 1635\u20131655 and served as Procurer General of Mihiel to\nParis during 1648\u201349. Although he is little-known today, he\nplayed an important role in the development and transmission of the\nCartesian philosophy, especially in Paris and Toulouse. He is best\nknown for his part in the theological controversy over the Cartesian\nexplication of the Eucharist (Desgabets, 1671), and for his defense of\nNicolas Malebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher (Desgabets,\n1675). His major philosophical writings were not published until\n 1983.[1]\n His contributions in natural philosophy include pioneering work in\nthe study of blood transfusion and mechanics. His unusual marriage of\nCartesianism and empiricism challenges many standard views of\nDescartes and the Cartesian philosophy.\n",
