    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Intentionality\n4.2 Intentionality\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s reflexivism poses a challenge: How\ncan a conscious mental occurrence constitute awareness of itself?\nAccording to a simple notion of intentionality, the object of an\nawareness-episode is always distinct from the awareness-episode. But\nif this view is correct, then conscious mental occurrences cannot be\nself-intimating. For if conscious mental occurrences were\nself-intimating, then awareness-episodes wouldn\u2019t be distinct\nfrom their own objects.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a replies to this worry with a regress argument\nthat is similar to F. H. Bradley\u2019s argument against external\nrelations (Bradley 1893: ch. II):\n\n\nThe relation between an object and its awareness cannot be distinct\nfrom the nature of its relata. If it were distinct, then, on pain of\nregress, one would have to accept that the relation between the first\nrelation and its relata is in the end identical to its own loci [i.e.,\nits relata]. If this is right, one would have to accept that the\nawareness of this second relation arises without any awareness of a\ndistinction between the relata and the relevant relation; for a\nrelation that is identical to its own loci oversteps the limitations\nof other relations. Analogously, the relation between an object and\nits awareness obtains even in the absence of any distinction between\nits relata, and the awareness of that relation also arises without any\nawareness of the relevant distinction. Where is the inconsistency?\n(KKh 56\u201357)\n\n\nHere is the idea. Suppose an object a is\nR1-related to an object b which is distinct\nfrom a. Let us suppose that R1 is distinct\nfrom both a and b. If R1 is distinct\nfrom a and b, then R1 itself would\nsomehow have to be related to a and b. But then we would\nhave to posit another relation, R2, thus launching\nourselves on an infinite regress. The only way to escape this regress\nwould be to say that there is some relation Ri which\nis not distinct from its relata. But there is no reason to think that\nthis relation isn\u2019t R1 itself. So, for any\nrelation R, we may conclude that it isn\u2019t distinct from\nits relata. So, the aboutness relation\n(vi\u1e63aya-vi\u1e63ayi-bh\u0101va) that connects an\nobject with its awareness also cannot be distinct from its relata. If\nthe object is identical to the aboutness relation that connects it to\nits awareness, and the aboutness relation is identical to the\nawareness, then the object must also be identical to its\nawareness.\n\nHowever, the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher has a stock\nresponse to the regress argument \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a uses to\nmotivate his view: it is to posit a self-linking relation\n(svar\u016bpa-sambandha). The underlying thought is that\nsometimes, when one entity a is related to another entity\nb, this state of affairs isn\u2019t decomposable into three\nelements which are distinct from each other, i.e., a, b,\nand a relation R that is distinct from both a and\nb. Rather, the relation R may just be non-distinct from\neither a or b. Yet, since it connects a or\nb to something else, it still remains a relation; it is thus a\nself-linking relation. This will block the regress argument\nthat \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a wishes to run. In The Discrimination\nof the Truth about the Self (\u0100tmatattvaviveka),\nUdayana endorses a view of this kind (\u015a\u0101stri 1940: 224).\n\n\naboutness The property of being about an\nobject is the particular nature of an awareness-episode, namely, just\nits being-of-that-ness (prak\u0101\u015basya sata\u1e25\ntad\u012byat\u0101m\u0101trar\u016bpa\u1e25\nsvabh\u0101vavi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e25).\n\n\n\nThe underlying thought is that the aboutness relation is a\nself-linking relation: it is the particular nature that an\nawareness-episode e possesses, namely, its nature of being an\nawareness of the relevant object o.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s main objection against this\ndefinition of aboutness involves a threat of idealism\n(vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da) (KKh 650ff). He points out\nthat the property of being-of-that-ness that Udayana speaks\nof is decomposable into two elements: the part picked out by the\nexpression \u2018that\u2019, namely the object of awareness\no, and the part picked out by \u201cbeing of\u201d, which\ncorresponds to the relation R by which the awareness-episode is\nrelated to the object. If both these elements are part of the nature\nof the awareness-episode\u2014the definition claims\u2014then the\nobject o wouldn\u2019t be external to the awareness-episode\ne. The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view, therefore, would\ncollapse into idealism!\n\nPerhaps, the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher could claim\nthat it is not the object o that is the part of the\nawareness-episode\u2019s nature, but only the relation R. This\ndoesn\u2019t satisfy \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a. He points out that\nsince R could be a relation with multiple instances and\ntherefore could hold between a different awareness-episode e*\nand a different object o*, the fact that R is part of\nthe nature of e wouldn\u2019t explain why it constitutes an\nawareness of o. Perhaps, we could say that R also\npossesses a certain being-of-that-ness in virtue of which it\nis merely a relation between o and the awareness-episode\ne. This proposal, as \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a seems to suggest,\ntries to explain the being-of-that-ness that the\nawareness-episode possesses, by positing another kind of\nbeing-that-ness in the relation R that connects the\nawareness-episode e with its object o. Quite predictably,\ntherefore, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a asks whether this second variety\nof being-of-that-ness is part of the nature of the relation R,\nor external to it.\n\nIf this being-of-that-ness is part of the nature of R, a line\nof reasoning similar to the one that led to the worry about idealism\ncould be run again. If the being-of-that-ness is part of the\nnature of the relation, then, since \u2018that\u2019 refers to the\nobject here, the object too should be part of R\u2019s nature.\nAnd since R is part of the nature of the awareness-episode\ne, the object o too should be part of the nature of\ne. Thus, the threat of idealism will arise again! (Moreover, if\nwe say that o is not part of the nature of the relation\nR, but only some further relation R* is, then the same\nmove could be made again, thus launching us on an infinite\nregress).\n\nBut suppose this being-of-that-ness that R has is\nexternal to R. What is that property? It cannot be anything\ndistinct from (the nature of) the object of awareness o; if it\nwere, then another regress argument could be run. So, let\u2019s\nsuppose this being-of-that-ness which R has is identical to\no. The question, again, is this: How is this being-of-that-ness\nrelated to R? If it is not related by a self-linking relation,\nan infinite regress will be unavoidable. If it is related by a\nself-linking relation, then the object o will be part of the\nnature of R, which in turn is part of the nature of the\nawareness-episode e. Thus, the problem of idealism will arise\nagain.\n\nMore generally, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s view is that there\nare no cases where the aboutness relation connects distinct objects.\nFor him, ordinary aboutness relations that seem to connect distinct\nobjects, e.g., the pot and its awareness, are ultimately unreal. What\nreally exists is the self-intimating consciousness. So, there is\nnothing wrong with treating the relata of the aboutness relation as\nidentical in every case.\n",
