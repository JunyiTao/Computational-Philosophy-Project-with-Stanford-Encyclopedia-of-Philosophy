    "main_text": "Ibn Bajja\n7. Ibn Bajja\n\nA number of philosophical works by the Spanish Arabo-Islamic author\nAbu Bakr Ibn Bajja (d. 1138), usually called \u201cIbn\nal-Sa\u2019igh\u201d by the Jewish tradition, were known and\nemployed by Medieval Jewish philosophers.\n\nThe first of these philosophers who gives evidence of having been\n\u2019influenced\u2019 by him is a well-known Jewish\nfellow-countryman and contemporary, Judah Halevi: as shown by Shlomo\nPines (see Pines 1980, 210\u2013217), in chapter 1 of book one of his\nBook of the Khazar he reflects not Avicenna\u2019s\nphilosophy (as in another place of his work: see above, 5), rather Ibn\nBajja\u2019s as expounded in his Epistle On the Conjunction of\nthe Agent Intellect with Man (Risala al-ittisal), and\ngives a sort of summary of his main ideas about God and the world.\nMaimonides had the highest esteem of Ibn Bajja: he affirmed that\n\u201che was a great and wise philosopher, and all his works are\nright and correct\u201d, and possibly appreciated him as a\ncommentator of Aristotle too (Marx 1934\u20131935, 379). In some\ncases he was surely influenced by Ibn Bajja\u2019s thought: in the\nGuide of the Perplexed, he explicitly refers to some of his\nphilosophical and scientific ideas, and reveals in particular the\ninfluence of his doctrines about the existence of only one intellect\nafter death, the possibility of the conjunction between man and the\nActive Intellect, the division of men into three classes (according to\ntheir different degrees of knowledge of the highest truths), as well\nas the idea of the prophet as a perfect solitary man, which seems to\nhave been inspired by Ibn Bajja\u2019s well-known work, the\nRegimen of the Solitary Man (Tadbir al-mutawahhid);\nmoreover, Maimonides knew also Ibn Bajja\u2019s hypothesis, according\nto which God would be the spirit of the celestial body which includes\nall that is around the earth (see Pines\u2019 observations in Moses\nMaimonides 1963, 1:ciii-cvii; about Maimonides\u2019 knowledge of Ibn\nBajja\u2019s doctrines, see also Davidson 2005, 114\u2013115). The\nlast idea was found by Maimonides in Ibn Bajja\u2019s commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, a work which appears to have been\nwell-known to a later Medieval Jewish philosopher: Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera. As shown by Bruno Chiesa and Yair Shiffman (Chiesa 1986,\n85\u201386; Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera 2001, 156\u2013157, 180, 207,\n221\u2013223, 265\u2013266, 277, 318, 323\u2013328, 331\u2013332),\nfor commenting on Maimonides\u2019 Guide Falaquera more or\nless literally quoted and shortly commented on a number of passages\ntaken from various works by Ibn Bajja: not only his Regimen of the\nSolitary Man and his Epistle On the Conjunction, but\nalso his Epistle of Farewell (Risala al-wada\u2018)\nand some less known works, like the already mentioned commentary on\nPhysics and the commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima; some of these quotations are found in Falaquera\u2019s\nBook of Degrees too.\n\nA substantial interest in Ibn Bajja\u2019s philosophical thought was\nshown by three other Jewish philosophers living in the first half of\nthe 14th century: Hezekiah bar Halafta, David Ibn Bilia and\nMoses Narboni. Hezekiah bar Halafta (nicknamed \u201cBonenfant de\nMillau\u201d), a Proven\u00e7al Jewish philosopher, wrote in 1320 a\nsupercommentary to Petrus Hispanus\u2019 Summulae, where a\nnumber of passages taken from Ibn Bajja\u2019s supercommentaries on\nal-Farabi\u2019s own summaries of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\nand Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De\ninterpretatione are found and commented on: this was the first\nand possibly unique case of the influence of Ibn Bajja as a logician\nand as an interpreter of al-Farabi on Medieval Jewish treatment of\nlogic (Zonta 1997b, 576\u2013583). David Ibn Bilia, a Portuguese Jew\nworking in the period 1320\u20131340, commissioned a translation of\nthe Epistle of Farewell to a certain Hayyim Ibn Vivas: he\nwrote marginal notes on some points of it (see Steinschneider 1893,\n358\u2013359). Moses Narboni too commented on this Epistle\n(see Hayoun 1990a; critical edition in Hayoun 1990b); moreover, he\ncommissioned (or wrote himself) and commented on a Hebrew compendium\nof Ibn Bajja\u2019s Regimen (critical edition in Hayoun\n1987). Narboni\u2019s positive approach to this Arab-Islamic\nphilosopher might have been suggested by Maimonides\u2019\naffirmations about Ibn Bajja. Narboni was a declared Averroist (see\nbelow, 9), but he might have tried to find in Ibn Bajja something in\nagreement with Averroes\u2019 philosophical thought.\n",
