    "main_text": "Modals and Speech Acts || Modalities\n8.2 Beyond assertion\n\nConditionals do not only appear in declarative sentences, but also in\nquestions and in commands, as in:\n\n(11)\nIf John visits, will Mary visit too?\n(12)\nIf John visits, make sure to bring cheese!\n\n\nThe semantics of imperatives and interrogatives lies beyond the scope\nof this entry. However, we mention such constructions because they too\nmay be seen as supporting Kratzer\u2019s restrictor analysis. In\nparticular, S. Kaufmann and Schwager (2011) treat imperatives as\ninvolving a covert modal operator, which can have a deontic, or\nbouletic meaning, but basically acting like \u201cmust\u201d. In the\ncase of questions, Isaacs and Rawlins (2008) treat questions as\nprefixed with a covert speech act operator, coming with a modal domain\nrestricted by the if-clause. In a related way, Ciardelli,\nGroenendijk, and Roelofsen (2018) point out that the semantics of a\nquestion can be specified by resolution conditions relative to an\ninformation state. Again, conditional questions can be viewed as\nappropriately restricting the information state to the antecedent\nworlds, so as to resolve the question relative to those (see\nCiardelli, forthcoming). For a polar question of form \\(?M\\)\n(\u201cwill Mary visit?\u201d) the information state \\(s\\) resolves\nit if either \\(s\\) supports \\(M\\) or \\(s\\) supports \\(\\neg M\\). In the\ncase of a conditional polar question like\n (11),\n the semantics of Ciardelli, Groenendijk, and Roelofsen (2018)\npredicts that a state \\(s\\) will resolve a question of the form \\(J\n>{?M}\\) provided either \\(s\\) supports \\(J >M\\) or \\(s\\)\nsupports \\(J >\\neg M\\).\n\nFurther connections have been explored between the semantics of\ninterrogatives and the very structure of conditional sentences. Starr\n(2014b) in particular argues that all conditionals have a\ntopic-comment structure, allowing to treat the antecedent as a covert\nquestion itself. Finally, more aspects of the interaction of\nconditional phrases with speech acts deserve to be mentioned,\nincluding so-called biscuit-conditionals (\u201cif you want\nsome biscuits, there are some in the cupboard\u201d, Austin 1956,\nLycan 2001), as well as concessives (\u201ceven if A, B\u201d\nsentences, see Lycan 2001, Guerzoni and Lim 2007). For both kinds,\npermitted inferences differ significantly from those found in regular\nconditionals (in particular, both entail the truth of the consequent).\nThis is evidence that the diversity found in logics of conditionals\nalso depends on the variety of uses and linguistic environments in\nwhich if-clauses occur.\n",
