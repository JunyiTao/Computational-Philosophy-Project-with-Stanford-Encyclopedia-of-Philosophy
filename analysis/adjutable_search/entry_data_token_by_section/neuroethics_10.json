    "main_text": "The Neuroscience of Ethics\n4. Looking forward: New neurotechnologies\n\nThe examples discussed above included pharmaceuticals that are already\napproved for use, existing brain imaging techniques and invasive\nneurotherapies. But practical neuroethical concerns, and some\ntheoretical concerns, are highly dependent upon the details of\ntechnologies. For example, adaptive DBS or aDBS, which \u201ccloses\nthe loop\u201d by concurrently stimulating and recording from neural\ntissue, and automatically adjusting stimulation based on the state of\nthe brain, raises more pressing and somewhat different concerns about\nagency and autonomy than does regular DBS (see, e.g. Goering et al.,\n2017). Several technologies are already on the horizon that are bound\nto raise some new neuroethical questions, or old questions in new\nguises. One of the most powerful new tools in the research\nneuroscientist\u2019s arsenal is \u201coptogenetics\u201d, a method\nof transfecting brain cells with genetically engineered proteins that\nmake the cell responsive to light of specific wavelengths (Diesseroth,\n2011). The cells can then be activated or silenced by shining light\nupon them, allowing for cell-specific external control. Optogenetics\nhas been successfully used in many model organisms, including rats,\nand work is underway to use optogenetics in monkeys. One may presume\nit is only a matter of time before it will be developed for use in\nhumans. The method promises to provide precise control of specific\nneural populations and relatively noninvasive targeted treatments for\ndiseases. It promises to raise the kind of neuroethical issues raised\nby many mechanisms that intervene on brain function: Questions of\nharm, of authenticity, and the prospect of brain cells being\ncontrolled by someone other than the agent himself (Gilbert, 2014;\nAdamczyk & Zawadzki, 2020). A second technique, CRISPR, allows\npowerful targeted gene editing. Although not strictly a\nneuroscientific technique, it can be used on neural cells to effect\nbrain changes at the genetic level (Canli, 2015). Genetic engineering\nmight make possible neural gene therapies and designer babies, making\nreal consequences of the genetic revolution thus far only\nimagined.\n\nThese and other technologies were not even imagined a few decades ago,\nand is likely that other future technologies will emerge which we\ncannot currently conceive of. If many neuroethical issues are closely\ntied to the capabilities of neurotechnologies, as I have argued, then\nwe will likely be unlikely to anticipate future technologies in enough\ndetail to predict the constellation of neuroethical issues that they\nmay give rise to. Neuroethics will have to grow as neuroscience does,\nadapting to novel ethical and technological challenges.\n",
