    "main_text": "Modality and Existence || Possibility and Necessity\n4.1 Possibility and Necessity\n\nThe so-called distinction between essence and existence reveals an\nunavoidable modal characterization of being. The starting-point of\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics is the existent, but the analysis\nAvicenna applies to it (see Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 6) does\nnot concern what exists insofar as it is existent (the existent is\nindefinable: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 13, 8\u201313), but\ninstead concerns the modality that explains the relation that\nwhat exists has to its own existence: an existent can be either\nnecessary in itself (\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b;\nw\u0101\u01e7ib: it is then also necessarily one) or possible\n(mumkin) in itself (this is the case of every existent with\nthe exception of the First Principle: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I,\n6, 37, 7\u201310). These distinctions thus reveal the inner complex\nof relations that explain existence: not only are the notions of\nexistent and thing primary, but so are those of unity, necessity\nand\u2014to some extent\u2014possibility\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 29, 5\u20136; 30, 3\u20134; 35,\n3\u20134; 36, 4\u20135). If, on the one hand, the primacy of these\nnotions ultimately leads to positing the transcendentals (de Libera\n1994; Aertsen 2008; Bertolacci 2008a; Koutzarova 2009), on the other\nhand they reveal that, in the world, being is always the being of\nsomething, so that the notions of existence (unity and\nnecessity), although separate from that of the thing, can never be\nisolated from the thing or from the relation that it has to existence\nitself. A crucial point is that the division between necessity and\npossibility regards something that exists. Avicenna speaks,\nin fact, precisely of what is \u201cnecessarily existent\u201d or of\nwhat is \u201cnecessary as far as existence is concerned\u201d\n(al-w\u0101\u01e7ib al-wu\u01e7\u016bd), and of what is\n\u201cpossibly existent\u201d or \u201cpossible as far as existence\nis concerned\u201d (al-mumkin al-wu\u01e7\u016bd). What is\nconsidered is the quiddity (m\u0101hiyya) or essence\n(\u1e0f\u0101t) of what exists: the modality of existence\ndepends, in fact, not on existence (which would be impossible), but on\nessence (although in the case of the Principle there is no essence\ndifferent from its own existence; see\n Section 2.4).\n\nNecessity (by virtue of another or in itself) defines the ways in\nwhich an existent exists: if an existent is necessary by\nvirtue of another and therefore in itself possible, it establishes a\nrelation \u2018of being caused\u2019 with something other than\nitself (its cause): it is precisely this relation that explains its\nexistence. If an existent is necessary in itself, there is no causal\nrelation at all (no cause). In this respect, possibility and necessity\nin existence are to be identified with the notion of need, dependence\nor link (the former) and with its negation (the latter;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 6). Consequently, what is possible is\nalways and inevitably an effect and answers the question why, while\nwhat exists necessarily does not refer to any cause and has no\n\u201cwhy\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 348,\n5\u20136; cf.VIII, 1, 327, 12\u2013329,4). The Necessary Existent\nhas no cause (cf. Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 80, 24\u201381,\n2). It has relations in so far as it is existent\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 343, 16\u2013344, 5; cf.\nLizzini 2013).\n",
