    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || The \u201cFoundation\u201d\n4.1 The \u201cFoundation\u201d\n\nThe published presentation of the first principles of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre commences with the proposition, \u201cthe\nI posits itself\u201d; more specifically, \u201cthe I posits itself\nas an I.\u201d Since this activity of \u201cself-positing\u201d is\ntaken to be the fundamental feature of I-hood in general, the first\nprinciple asserts that \u201cthe I posits itself as\nself-positing.\u201d Unfortunately, this starting point is somewhat\nobscured in Part I of the Foundation of the Entire\nWissenschaftslehre by a difficult and somewhat forced attempt on\nFichte\u2019s part to connect this starting point to the logical law\nof identity, as well as by the introduction of two additional\n\u201cfirst principles,\u201d corresponding to the logical laws of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason. (Significantly, this\ndistraction is eliminated entirely in the 1796/99\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo, which begins with the simple\n\u201cpostulate\u201d or \u201csummons\u201d to the reader:\n\u201cthink the I, and observe what is involved in doing\nthis.\u201d)\n\n\u201cTo posit\u201d (setzen) means simply \u201cto be\naware of,\u201d \u201cto reflect upon,\u201d or \u201cto be\nconscious of\u201d; this term does not imply that the I must simply\n\u201ccreate\u201d its objects of consciousness. The principle in\nquestion simply states that the essence of I-hood lies in the\nassertion of ones own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness\npresupposes self-consciousness (the Kantian \u201cI think,\u201d\nwhich must, at least in principle, be able to accompany all our\nrepresentations). Such immediate self-identify, however, cannot be\nunderstood as a psychological \u201cfact,\u201d no matter how\nprivileged, nor as an \u201caction\u201d or \u201caccident\u201d\nof some previously existing substance or being. To be sure, it is an\n\u201caction\u201d of the I, but one that is identical with the very\nexistence of the same. In Fichte\u2019s technical terminology, the\noriginal unity of self-consciousness is to be understood as both an\naction and as the product of the same: as a Tathandlung or\n\u201cfact/act,\u201d a unity that is presupposed by and contained\nwithin every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, though it\nnever appears as such therein.\n\nThis same \u201cidentity in difference\u201d of original\nself-consciousness might also be described as an \u201cintellectual\nintuition,\u201d inasmuch as it involves the immediate\npresence of the I to itself, prior to and independently of any sensory\ncontent. To be sure, such an \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d\nnever occurs, as such, within empirical consciousness; instead, it\nmust simply be presupposed (that is, \u201cposited\u201d) in order\nto explain the possibility of actual consciousness, within which\nsubject and object are always already distinguished. The occurrence of\nsuch an original intellectual intuition is itself inferred, not\nintuited.\n\nUnfortunately, Fichte confuses matters by sometimes using the term\n\u201cinner\u201d or \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d to\ndesignate something else entirely: namely, the act of\nphilosophical reflection or purified self-observation through\nwhich the philosopher becomes conscious of the transcendental\nconditions for the possibility of ordinary experience\u2014among\nwhich, of course, is the occurrence of the \u201coriginal\u201d\nintellectual intuition as a Tathandlung. On other occasions,\nhe employs the term \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d in yet\nanother sense: namely, to designate our direct, practical awareness\nwithin everyday life of our moral obligations (categorical imperative\nqua \u201creal intellectual intuition\u201d). Given the\nsubsequent abuse of this term by Schelling and the romantics, as well\nas the confusion that one sometimes finds among expositors of Fichte\non this issue, it is crucial to recognize systematic ambiguity of the\nterm \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d in Fichte\u2019s own\nwritings.\n\nA fundamental corollary of Fichte\u2019s understanding of I-hood\n(Ichheit) as a kind of fact/act is his denial that\nthe I is originally any sort of \u201cthing\u201d or\n\u201csubstance.\u201d Instead, the I is simply what it posits\nitself to be, and thus its \u201cbeing\u201d is, so to speak, a\nconsequence of its self-positing, or rather, is co-terminus with the\nsame. The first principle of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre is\nthus equally \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201ctheoretical,\u201d\ninsofar as the act described by this principle is a\n\u201cdoing\u201d as well as a \u201cknowing,\u201d a deed as well\nas a cognition. Thus the problematic unity of theoretical and\npractical reason is guaranteed from the start, inasmuch as this very\nunity is a condition for the possibility of self-consciousness.\n\nAfter establishing the first principle and conceiving the act\nexpressed therein, the philosophical task is then to discover what\nother acts must necessarily occur as conditions for the possibility of\nthe original, \u201csimply posited,\u201d first act and then to do\nthe same for each of these successively discovered acts (or the\ntheorems in which they are formulated). By continuing in this manner,\none will, according to Fichte, finally arrive at a complete deduction\nof the a priori structure of ordinary experience or, what amount to\nthe same thing, a complete inventory of the \u201coriginal acts of\nthe mind.\u201d This is precisely the task of the first or\n\u201cfoundational\u201d portion of the Jena system.\n\nJust as we are never directly aware of the original act of\nself-positing with which the system commences, so are we also\nunaware\u2014except, of course, from the artificial standpoint of\nphilosophical reflection\u2014of each of these additional\n\u201cnecessary but unconscious\u201d acts that are derived as\nconditions necessary for the possibility of the originally posited act\nof self-positing. Furthermore, though we must, due to the discursive\ncharacter of reflection itself, distinguish each of these acts from\nthe others that it is conditioned by and that are, in turn,\nconditioned by it, none of these individual acts actually occurs in\nisolation from all of the others. Transcendental philosophy is thus an\neffort to analyze what is in fact the single,\nsynthetic act through which the I posits for itself both\nitself and its world, thereby becoming aware in a single moment of\nboth its freedom and its limitations, its infinity and its finitude.\nThe result of such an analysis is the recognition that, although\n\u201cthe I simply posits itself,\u201d its freedom is never\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201cunlimited\u201d; instead, freedom\nproves to be conceivable\u2014and hence the I itself proves to be\npossible\u2014only as limited and finite. Despite widespread\nmisunderstanding of this point, the Wissenschaftslehre is not\na theory of the absolute I. Instead, the conclusion of both the\nFoundation of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre and of the\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo is that the \u201cabsolute\nI\u201d is a mere abstraction and that the only sort of I that can\nactually exist or act is a finite, empirical, embodied, individual\nself.\n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit\nitself only insofar as it posits itself as limited (and hence divided\nagainst itself, inasmuch as it also posits itself as unlimited or\n\u201cabsolute\u201d). Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its\nown limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits.\nThe finite I (the intellect) cannot be the ground of its own\npassivity. Instead, according to Fichte\u2019s analysis, if the I is\nto posit itself at all, it must simply discover itself to be\nlimited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as a\n\u2018check\u2019 or Ansto\u00df to the free, practical\nactivity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a\nlimit for the I only insofar as the I posits it as such. I does this,\naccording to Fichte\u2019s analysis, by positing its own limitation,\nfirst, as a mere \u201cfeeling,\u201d then as a\n\u201csensation,\u201d then as an \u201cintuition\u201d of a\nthing, and finally as a \u201cconcept.\u201d The\nAnsto\u00df thus provides the essential occasion or impetus\nthat first sets in motion the entire complex train of activities that\nfinally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves as\nempirical individuals and of a world of spatio-temporal material\nobjects.\n\nThough this doctrine of the Ansto\u00df may seem to play a\nrole in Fichte\u2019s philosophy not unlike that which has sometimes\nbeen assigned to the thing in itself in the Kantian system, the\nfundamental difference is this: the Ansto\u00df is not\nsomething foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the I\u2019s original\nencounter with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the Not-I is\nthe cause or ground of the Ansto\u00df, Fichte argues that\nthe former is posited by the I precisely in order to\n\u201cexplain\u201d to itself the latter, that is, in order to\nbecome conscious of the same. Though the Wissenschaftslehre\ndemonstrates that such an Ansto\u00df must occur if\nself-consciousness is to be actual, transcendental philosophy itself\nis quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such\nan Ansto\u00df\u2014except as a condition for the\npossibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to\nwhat can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience.\nAccording to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain, for\nexample, why the world has a spatio-temporal character and a causal\nstructure, but it can never explain why objects have the particular\nsensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate\nindividual rather than another. This is something that the I simply\nhas to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom,\nand indeed, as a condition for the latter. (It must be admitted,\nhowever, that Fichte\u2019s own ambitious descriptions of his project\nsometimes obscure the essential limits of the same and that he\nsometimes gives his readers the false impression that the\nWissenschaftslehre proposes to provide a complete a priori\ndeduction of all the empirical details of experience. This however is\ncertainly not the case.)\n\nDespite this important stricture on the scope of transcendental\nphilosophy, there remains much that can be demonstrated within the\nfoundational portion of the Wissenschaftslehre. For example,\nit can be shown that the I could not become conscious of its own\nlimits in the manner required for the possibility of any\nself-consciousness unless it also possessed an original and\nspontaneous ability to synthesize the finite and the infinite. In this\nsense, the Wissenschaftslehre deduces the power of productive\nimagination as an original power of the mind. Similarly, it can be\nshown that the I could not be \u201cchecked\u201d in the manner\nrequired for the possibility of consciousness unless it possessed, in\naddition to its original \u201ctheoretical\u201d power of productive\nimaginative, an equally original \u201cpractical\u201d power of\nsheer willing, which, once \u201cchecked,\u201d is immediately\nconverted into a capacity for endless striving. The foundational\nportion of the Wissenschaftslehre thus also includes a\ndeduction of the categorical imperative (albeit in a particularly\nabstract and morally empty form) and of the practical power of the I.\nFor Fichte, therefore, \u201cthe primacy of the practical\u201d\nmeans not simply that philosophy must recognize a certain autonomous\nsphere within which practical reason is efficacious and practical\nconsiderations are appropriate; instead, it implies something much\nstronger: namely, the recognition that, as Fichte puts it, \u201cthe\npractical power is the innermost root of the I\u201d and thus that\n\u201cour freedom itself is a theoretical determining principle of\nour world.\u201d The Wissenschaftslehre as a whole can\ntherefore be described as a massive effort to demonstrate that reason\ncould not be theoretical if it were not also practical\u2014at the\nsame time, to be sure, that also demonstrates that reason could not be\npractical if were not also theoretical.\n\nFreedom, according to Fichte\u2019s argument, is possible and actual\nonly within the context of limitation and necessity, and thus it is\nnever \u201cabsolute,\u201d but always limited and finite. On the\nother hand, just as surely as a free subject must posit its freedom\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d\u2014that is to say, \u2018purely and\nsimply\u2019 (schlechthin) and \u201cfor no reason\u201d\nwhatsoever\u2014so must it never identify itself with any determinate\nor limited state of its own being. On the contrary, a finite free self\nmust constantly strive to transform both the natural and the human\nworlds in accordance with its own freely-posited goals. The sheer\nunity of the self, which was posited as the starting point of the\nFoundations, is thereby transformed into an idea of\nreason in the Kantian sense: the actual I is always finite and divided\nagainst itself, and hence it is always striving for a sheer\nself-determinacy that it never achieves. Between the original\nabstraction of pure selfhood as sheer Tathandlung and the\nconcluding (necessary) idea of a self that is only what it determines\nitself to be, in which \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought\u201d wholly\ncoincide, lies the entire realm of actual consciousness and real human\nexperience.\n",
