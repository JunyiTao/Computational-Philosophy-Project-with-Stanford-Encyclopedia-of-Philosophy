    "main_text": "The Physical Principles || Mind/Intellect\n3.3 Mind/Intellect\n\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Anaxagoras acquired the nickname Mr.\nMind (DK 59 A1); his view that the cosmos is controlled by\nnous, mind or intelligence, first attracted and then\ndisappointed Socrates (Plato, Phaedo 97b8ff.). Plato and\nAristotle applauded Anaxagoras for using nous as the\nfirst principle of motion, but both criticized him for failing to be\nconsistent in that use, arguing that once he invoked Mind to set the\noriginal mixture in motion, Anaxagoras reduced later causes to\nmindless mechanism.\n\n\nAnaxagoras is adamant that nous is completely different\nfrom the ingredients that constituted the original mixture. It is the\nonly thing to which the Everything-in-Everything principle does not\napply. Mind is present to some things, but it is not an ingredient or share as\nflesh and blood are ingredients in a dog (B11: \u201cIn everything\nthere is a share of everything except nous, but there\nare some things in which nous, too, is\npresent\u201d). In B12 (the longest extant fragment), Anaxagoras\nclaims that if nous were just another ingredient it\ncould neither know nor rule in the way that it does.\n\n\nThe other things have a share of everything, but nous\nis unlimited and self-ruling and has been mixed with no thing, but is\nalone itself by itself. For if it were not by itself, but had been\nmixed with anything else, then it would partake of all things, if it\nhad been mixed with anything (for there is a share of everything in\neverything just as I have said before); and the things mixed together\nwith it would thwart it, so that it would control none of the things\nin the way that it in fact does, being alone by itself. For it is the\nfinest of all things and the purest, and indeed it maintains all\ndiscernment about everything and has the greatest strength. (59 B12,\nin part)\n\n\nMind/Intellect plays a number of roles in Anaxagoras\u2019 system.  First, it\ninaugurates the rotation of the mass of ingredients; it then controls\nthat rotation, and the local rotations that take place within the\nlarge whirl that is the whole cosmos:\n\nNous controlled the whole revolution, so that it\nstarted to revolve in the beginning. First it began to revolve from a\nsmall region, but it is revolving yet more, and it will revolve still\nmore\u2026 And whatever sorts of things were going to be, and\nwhatever sorts were and now are not, and as many as are now and\nwhatever sorts will be, all these nous set in\norder. And nous also ordered this revolution, in which\nthe things being separated off now revolve, the stars and the sun and\nthe moon and the air and the aether. This revolution caused them to\nseparate off.  (59 B12, in part)\n\nNous then is not only first cause, it also, one might\nsay, is the preserver of order in the cosmos, as it maintains the\nrotations that govern all the natural processes. Anaxagoras does not\nexplain how these processes work, or how nous can\naffect the ingredients. But there is a hint of his reasoning in a\ncomment in Aristotle (Metaphysics I.3.984b15):\n\n\nWhen someone said that nous is present \u2014 in\nnature just as it is in animals \u2014 as the cause of the cosmos and\nof all its order, he appeared as a sober man among the random\nchatterers who preceded him. (We know that Anaxagoras clearly held\nthese views, but Hermotimus of Clazomenae gets the credit for holding\nthem earlier.)\n\n\nJust as we control our bodies by our thoughts, so the cosmos is\ncontrolled by nous; we may be unclear about the\ndetails, but the results are obvious to us. One fundamental point\nabout Anaxagoras\u2019 theory of mind is that he nowhere in the extant\nmaterial identifies mind with a divine principle or god. In fragment\n1018 and in Trojan Women (886), Euripides says that mind is\ngod in each of us, and connects the necessity of the universe with\nZeus and mind, and these claims are thought to have been influenced by\nAnaxagoras\u2019 views. Although later testimonial reports in A\u00ebtius\nand Iamblichus say that Anaxagoras connected nous and\ngod, there are many more reports of his denial of divinity to the\nheavenly bodies and his alleged atheism.\n\nNous is the most powerful thing in the cosmos,\ncontrolling the rotation and all ensouled things. Part of that power\nand control lies in its powers of knowledge. Anaxagoras asserts that\nnous has all judgment and discernment about all things;\nmoreover, this knowledge extends to everything that emerges from the\nmixtures and dissociations caused by the original rotation:\n\n\nAnd nous discerned them all: the things that are being mixed\ntogether, the things that are being separated off, and the things that\nare being dissociated. And whatever sorts of things were going to be,\nand whatever sorts were and now are not, and as many as are now and\nwhatever sorts will be, all these nous set in\norder. (B12, in part)\n\n\nThis suggests a beginning of an answer to the objections lodged\nagainst Anaxagoras\u2019 use of nous as a cause. While\nnous is not the teleological and ethical cause for which Socrates was\nsearching in the Phaedo, nous could serve as an\nultimate explanation. Anaxagoras nowhere says that\nnous arranges things in a certain way because it is best for\nthem to be so, or even suggests something like an Aristotelian final\ncause, (although Sedley 2007 argues that exactly this view is implicit\nin the fragments, contra: Graham, 2009, Sisko 2010a).  Things are the way\nthey are because that is the way things have unfolded\nsince nous first set everything in motion, and as it\ncontinued to move them. (One might compare this to the role of the\nunmoved mover as the ultimate cause in Aristotle\u2019s universe; despite\nbeing the first cause the unmoved mover does not create.)\n\n\nAnaxagoras links mind and soul in B12: \u201cnous has\ncontrol over all things that have soul, both the larger and the\nsmaller.\u201d This suggests not only that Anaxagoras took the\nactions of humans and animals as the model for how nous\ncontrols the cosmos, but also suggests how nous differs from\nthe other ingredients. He claims that it is the purest and finest of\nall things. Some scholars argue that it is only in Plato that we meet\na genuine notion of the immaterial (Renehan 1980, Sedley 2007), but\nAnaxagoras\u2019 denial that nous is mixed with or partakes of\nother ingredients (while still being in some of them) and his\ninsistence on its fineness and purity may suggest that he is thinking\nof mind as a non-corporeal entity that can pervade and control a body\nor even the whole cosmos without being a material part of it (Curd\n2009). On either interpretation, if\nnous were simply an ordinary ingredient on a par with the\nother basic ingredients, then, as Anaxagoras notes in B12, its relative\nsmallness would allow it to be swamped and overcome\n(\u201cthwarted\u201d) by the other ingredients.\n",
