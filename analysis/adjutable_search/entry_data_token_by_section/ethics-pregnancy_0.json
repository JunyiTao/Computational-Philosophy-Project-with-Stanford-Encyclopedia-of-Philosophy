    "main_text": "Medicalization\n1. Medicalization\n\nPregnancy and childbirth have become increasingly medicalized\nin most parts of the world since the early twentieth century. That is,\nthey are increasingly processes that\u2014in fact and as a social\nideal\u2014are managed and overseen by medical professionals,\ntypically involve a high degree of technological medical intervention\nand contact with clinics and hospitals, and are assessed by medical\nexperts who are the authorities on their progress. Amy Mullin explains\nthat medicalized pregnancy \u201cinvolves interpreting pregnancy\nitself as a disruption to health that necessarily requires expert\nmedical intervention, and thinking of pregnancy as primarily about\nhealth and illness\u201d (Mullin 2005, 54). The concept of\nmedicalization is helpful in making clear how this sort of insertion\ninto a medical context is not (or not simply) a response to fixed\nbiological facts, but rather a contingent social and institutional\nprocess. Death, depression, and short attention span are other\nexamples of processes or conditions that have undergone intense\nmedicalization. In general, medicalization comes with both benefits\nand burdens, and the medicalization of pregnancy and birth is no\nexception. Increasingly few obstetricians would claim that intense\nmedicalization straightforwardly promotes good birth outcomes for\nmothers and infants; rather, almost all would acknowledge that while\nmedical interventions have lessened many risks (e.g. death from\nplacenta previa and ectopic pregnancy), other medical interventions\nhave become routine despite having no proven benefit and some proven\nadded risks for patients (e.g. routine fetal monitoring, normalization\nof the lithotomy position for childbirth, and episiotomies). Partly\nbecause of these mixed effects of increased medicalization, opposing\nnarratives of pregnancy and birth continue to grow in visibility and\nsupport. These narratives may aim to de-medicalize the notion of\nnormalcy in pregnancy and birth, or centralize the knowledge and\ncompetence of midwifery (e.g., Lyerly 2012; Shaw 2013)\n\nThe medicalization of pregnancy and birth takes many forms. North\nAmerican births typically involve a variety of technological\ninterventions, regularly including labor-inducing drugs, spinal\nepidurals, fetal monitoring, and\u2014in roughly one third of\nbirths\u2014surgical delivery. Prior to birth, most pregnancies will\ninvolve medical interventions such as genetic testing, ultrasound\nscreening, prescriptions to control various symptoms and risks,\nand\u2014with increasing frequency\u2014technological assistance for\nconception. Importantly, however, the rate and intensity with which\nsuch interventions are offered or imposed is far from uniform. Dorothy\nRoberts highlights the striking disparity of benefits enjoyed as a\nresult of medicalization: \"The multibillion-dollar apparatus devoted\nto technologically facilitating affluent couples' procreative\ndecisions stands in glaring contrast to the high rate of infant death\namong black people, which remains more than twice the rate for whites\"\n(2009, 784, citing Mathews and MacDorman 2007). Some dimensions of the\nmedicalization of pregnancy do not directly involve medical\ninterventions. Both inside and outside the clinic, pregnancy is\ntreated as a medical event requiring intense risk management,\nmonitoring, and appeals to expert medical knowledge: pregnant women\nare expected to regulate and monitor their eating, drinking, fetal\nkicks, weight gain, sleeping position, emotions, exposure to basic\nhousehold products, exercise, sexual activity, and many other aspects\nof their lives according to standards established by medical\nprofessionals (Kukla 2005). Recently, there has been a vigorous\nmandate to involve medical professionals in helping women regulate\ntheir bodies in accordance with medical standards for minimizing\nreproductive risk even prior to conception. The CDC now recommends\nthat all primary care for all women who may\neventually become pregnant (including prepubescent girls) be treated\nas \u2018preconception care\u2019 (Kuehn 2006). A majority of women\nembrace at least some aspects of medicalization; many take it as part\nof responsible motherhood to maximize the expert management of their\npregnancies and to follow risk-minimization advice carefully (Seigel\n2013).\n\nThe general trend towards medicalizing pregnancy and birth has had\nseveral ethically noteworthy effects (Davis-Floyd 2004, Duden 1993,\nMitchell 2001, Morgan 1998, Sherwin 1992). First, medicalization has\nencouraged us to imagine pregnancy and birth as inherently high-risk,\npathological processes that it is irresponsible to undertake without\nlarge amounts of expert help and surveillance. Second, when medical\nprofessionals become the primary managers of reproduction, pregnant\nwomen's epistemic privilege is undermined and they are arguably\nreduced to playing passive roles in their own pregnancies and births\n(e.g., Freeman 2015). Third, some have argued that medicalization has\nrendered pregnancy in general, and labor and birth in particular, more\nalienating and stressful for women, burdening them with constant and\ncomplicated responsibilities for elaborate risk management and bodily\nand behavioral surveillance (for review see, e.g., Mykitiuk and Scott\n2011; Savell 2012).\n\nAmong the voices pushing back against the medicalization of\nreproduction are those that insist that pregnancy is a\n\u2018natural\u2019 process that generally needs no technological\nassistance, and advocate \u2018natural\u2019 childbirth, free of\nlabor-inducing and pain medications and attended by midwives rather\nthan doctors. There are reasons for philosophers to be as wary of the\n\u2018natural\u2019 birth movement as of uncritical, unchecked\nmedicalization (Kukla 2005, Lyerly 2006 and 2012, Purdy 2001).\nTypically, its advocates do not specify a clear concept of the\n\u2018natural\u2019\u2014for example, they have no account of why\nprescription pain medications are \u2018unnatural\u2019 while\nacupuncture or pain-relieving herbs are \u2018natural\u2019. Nor do\nthey explain why the \u2018natural\u2019 is prima facie\nbetter or more ethical. More broadly, this account of pregnancy and\nbirth involves comparable pressures on pregnant women to conform to\nrigid standards of attitudes and behaviours, and, like the medicalized\naccount, is in danger of de-politicizing and essentializing the\nexperience and management of pregnant women (Beckett 2005, Malacrida\nand Boulton 2014).\n\nFrank Chervenak and Laurence McCullough (2006) contrast\nmedicalization, not with an absence of technological interventions,\nbut with the co-option of these technological interventions by the\nnon-medical sphere of commodification. They focus on the upsurge in\n\u201cboutique\u201d fetal ultrasound centers that offer expectant\nparents \u201cpictures of the baby\u201d, without any pretence that\nthese pictures serve a diagnostic medical role. They argue that such\nnon-medical, social imaging is ethically unacceptable, as it raises\nconcerns about informed consent, psychosocial risks to women, false\nsenses of security in the health of the baby, and economic conflicts\nof interest. They conclude that medical professionals ought to retain\ncontrol and authority over the use and interpretation of fetal imaging\ntechnology. Their argument could easily be extended to other\ntechnologies used in obstetrics.\n\nYet Chervenak and McCullough may overestimate the authority that\nmedical professionals are generally able to exercise over the meaning\nand use of technology. For instance, ultrasound imaging is already\nviewed by pregnant women as playing much more of a social than a\nmedical role; whether it occurs in a medical clinic or at a boutique\nparlour, it is primarily understood as the first opportunity to\n\u201cmeet the baby\u201d, and women are caught off guard when this\nevent yields substantive medical information (Mitchell 2001, Kukla\n2005a). All the same, their argument raises an important point: the\nalternative to medicalized pregnancy is not, in practice,\n\u2018natural\u2019 pregnancy. Instead, medicine is one institution\namong many that vies for control over the cultural use and\nsignificance of this technology, and pregnancy is likely to continue\nto be technologically intensive no matter how his struggle plays\nout.\n",
