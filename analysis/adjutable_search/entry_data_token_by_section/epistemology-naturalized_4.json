However, because of\nits undeniable historical importance, and because it will serve to\nintroduce some of the principal objections to NE, it can hardly be\nignored.\n\nLike Descartes, Quine takes epistemology to be \u201cconcerned with\nthe foundations of science\u201d (1969b: 69). Addressing the logical\nempiricist project of rational reconstruction, he says that \n\n\n[t]he Cartesian quest for certainty [is] the remote motivation of\nepistemology, both on its conceptual side and its doctrinal side.\n(1969b: 74) \n\n\nAbout the epistemological project, so understood, Quine\u2019s chief\nobservation is hardly news: the Cartesian quest is \u201ca lost\ncause\u201d (ibid.). Whether in the form Descartes himself\npracticed, or in any subsequent form up to and including the logical\nempiricists\u2019, work on both the conceptual and the doctrinal side\nis bound to fail: no strict translation of the notion of\n\u201cbody\u201d in sensory terms is possible, and \u201cthe\ninferential steps between sensory evidence and scientific doctrine\nmust fall short of certainty\u201d (1969b: 74\u201375).\n\nWhat is new in \u201cEpistemology Naturalized\u201d is what\nQuine recommends in the face of this result:\n\n\nWhy all this creative reconstruction, all this make-believe? The\nstimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody has\nhad to go on, ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the world. Why\nnot just see how this construction really proceeds? Why not settle for\npsychology? (1969b: 75)\n\nIf all we hope for is a reconstruction that links science to\nexperience in explicit ways short of translation, then it would seem\nmore sensible to settle for psychology. Better to discover how science\nis in fact developed and learned than to fabricate a fictitious\nstructure to a similar effect. (1969b: 78)\n\nEpistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a\nchapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a\nnatural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject\nis accorded a certain experimentally controlled input\u2014certain\npatterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for\ninstance\u2014and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as\noutput a description of the three-dimensional external world and its\nhistory. The relation between the meager input and the torrential\noutput is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the\nsame reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to\nsee how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one\u2019s\ntheory of nature transcends any available evidence\u2026.But a\nconspicuous difference between old epistemology and the\nepistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that\nwe can now make free use of empirical psychology. (1969b: 82\u201383)\n\n\n\nEven if it would offend strong anti-psychologists, it is not the\nsuggestion that epistemologists make \u201cfree use\u201d of\nempirical psychology that is so radical; it is the suggestion that\npsychology can and should replace epistemology. (As\nwe\u2019ll see in\n Section 3.2\n below, in later writings Quine cites other sciences as being relevant\nto epistemology naturalized as well. But that does not affect the\npresent discussion.) In terms of the features of TE laid out above\n (Section 1.1),\n Quine appears here to be rejecting\n (a)\u2013(c)\n altogether: epistemology\u2014\u201cor something like\nit\u201d\u2014is recast as wholly a posteriori,\ndescriptive, and anything but autonomous. As to\n (d),\n the traditional concern with finding an adequate response to the\nskeptic, Quine, in later writings, responds with the claim that\n\u201cskeptical doubts are scientific doubts\u201d (1975: 68):\n\n\nScepticism is an offshoot of science. The basis for scepticism is the\naware\u00adness of illusion, the discovery that we must not always\nbelieve our eyes.\u2026But in what sense are they illusions? In the\nsense that they seem to be material objects which they in fact are\nnot. Illusions are illusions only relative to prior acceptance of\ngenuine bodies with which to contrast them\u2026.The positing of\nbodies is already rudimentary physical science; and it is only after\nthat stage that the sceptic\u2019s invidious distinctions make\nsense.\u2026Rudimentary physical science, that is, common sense\nabout bodies, is thus needed as a springboard for scepticism\u2026.\n(1975: 67)\n\n\nBut if skepticism itself is born of science, we can appeal to science\nin answering its doubts. For instance, we can look to natural\nselection, and find \u201csome encouragement in Darwin\u201d in\nquelling doubts about the reliability of induction:\n\n\ncreatures inveterately wrong in their inductions have a pathetic but\npraiseworthy tendency to die out before reproducing more of their\nkind. (1969c: 126)\n\n\n(For similar ideas, see Kornblith 1994a and Dretske 1989. For a\ndiscussion of \u201cevolutionary epistemology\u201d, a specific\navenue of study that treats both aspects of human cognition and theory\nchange in science in terms of selectional processes, see Bradie and\nHarms 2015.)\n\nIn thus deflating the skeptical problem, Quine turns his back on\n (d),\n the final characteristic feature of TE. In terms of the forms of NE\ndiscussed above\n (Section 1.2),\n Quine appears to be recommending replacement naturalism and,\nconsequently, the elimination of terms of epistemic appraisal in favor\nof descriptions of psychological goings-on (eliminative NE).\n",
