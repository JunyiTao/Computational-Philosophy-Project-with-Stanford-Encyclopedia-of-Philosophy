    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || Types of Justificatory Reason\n2.3 Types of Justificatory Reason\n\nA chief disagreement among public justification theorists concerns the\nnature of justificatory reasons. Variable \\(R_i\\) in the PJP\nrepresents the contrast. The mainstream view within public reason\ncircles is that justificatory reasons are shared. More accurately,\nmembers of the public can share all justificatory reasons. The reasons\nare shareable. (Or, at least, be \u201caccessible\u201d in a sense\noutlined below (see 2.3.2)). On these \u201cconsensus\u201d views,\n\\(R_i\\) is the same for each individual \\(i\\).\n\u201cConvergence\u201d views allow \\(R_i\\) to differ between\nmembers of the public. John may have his reason \\(R_1\\), whereas Reba\nmay have her \\(R_2\\). Citizens can see the reasons as justified\naccording to reasonable evaluative standards. But they need not adopt\nthose standards themselves. So, on a convergence view, a private\nreligious reason can be justificatory. One person\u2019s reasons can\ndiffer from another. Each has reasons, but these reasons aren\u2019t\nthe same in the two cases. (See D\u2019Agostino 1996, 30) Again,\nreligious reasons may form some of those reasons.\n\nThe idea of people having different reasons may seem odd to some. But\nwe recognize convergence reasoning in various contexts. One concerns\nmarket transactions. Suppose \\(A\\) has apples and \\(B\\) has bananas.\n\\(A\\) wants some bananas, and \\(B\\) wants some apples. After a trade,\nboth have a mixture and regard themselves as better off. Here \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) exchanged for different reasons. And so, the arrangement has\na convergence justification. Each has a reason of their own to prefer\nit. And note that the point stands even if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) find one\nanother\u2019s reasons quite alien. Indeed, they might not even know\none another\u2019s reasons. But the arrangement still has a kind of\npublic justification.\n\nSo convergence only requires that individuals have their reasons\n\\(R_i\\), which creates set \\(\\{R_1, R_2 , \\ldots ,R_n\\}\\) to support\n\\(L\\). Consensus requires, in the limit, that all members of the\npublic share a (set of) reason(s) \\(R\\) to endorse \\(L\\).\n\nBut even convergence limits the range of justificatory reasons:\n\\(A\\)\u2019s reasons for endorsing \\(L\\) might be repugnant, perhaps\nenough to undermine \\(L\\)\u2019s public justification. For this\nreason, convergence theorists appeal to idealization (see 2.4\nbelow).\n\nAgain, the consensus approach remains dominant. Convergence is in the\nminority, both in earlier and contemporary works. (Gaus 1990, 256;\nStout 2004; Klosko 1993 vs Gaus 2011; Vallier 2014; Vallier 2019, Gaus\n2021).\n\nBut the public reason tradition provides grounds for both approaches.\nRawls seems to have combined the two approaches. Rawls looks like a\nconsensus theorist in the \u201cfreestanding\u201d stage of\npolitical justification. He (2005, 12) says that citizens should use\nshared reasons to converge on a political conception of justice. But\nin the \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d stage, Rawls leaves\njustification \u201cto each person.\u201d Each person must sync the\npolitical conception of justice with their comprehensive doctrine, and\nthe public adopts no single comprehensive doctrine. Rawls included\nboth accounts of justificatory reasons in his view, yet while the\ncombined view is attractive, many writers feel compelled to reject\nit.\n\nHabermas (1995) provides the most well-known illustration of the\ntension in Rawls. Gaus (2011) opts for overlapping\nconsensus/convergence justifications. Quong (2011) opts for\nfree-standing/consensus justifications. Vallier and Muldoon (2021)\nargue that these answers generate two public reason projects. Gaus\nfounded a \u201cdiversity project\u201d focused on how diverse\nreasoning resolves social conflicts. Quong founded a \u201ccoherence\nproject\u201d focused on rendering key political concepts\ncoherent.\n\nAs noted, even convergence theorists adopt restrictions on the set of\njustificatory reasons. Some discipline is implicit in the concept of\n\u201ca reason.\u201d A factual claim does not justify a principle\nif evidence falsifies the claim, and a normative claim is not a reason\nto endorse \\(L\\) if it lacks real normative force. So, we need to\narticulate some tests that count reasons as justificatory. The entry\norganizes them by increasing stringency: intelligibility,\naccessibility, and shareability.\n2.3.1 Intelligibility\n\nDefine intelligibility and the intelligibility requirement as\nfollows:\n\n\nIntelligibility: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is intelligible\nto members of the public if and only if members of the public regard\n\\(R_A\\) as justified for \\(A\\) according to \\(A\\)\u2019s evaluative\nstandards.\n\nIntelligibility Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law \\(L\\)\nonly if it is intelligible to all members of the public.\n\n\n\\(A\\)\u2019s intelligible reasons are those members can see as\nreasons for \\(A\\), who advances them. And members see \\(A\\)\u2019s\nreasons as reasons for \\(A\\) based on \\(A\\)\u2019s own evaluative\nstandards. Contrast these reasons with mere utterances, expressions of\nemotions, or irrational demands: intelligible reasons have rational\ngrounds.\n\nIntelligibility theorists (Vallier 2016b) argue that reasonable\npluralism applies to evaluative standards as it applies to reasons\n(Vallier 2011). Reasonable people can dispute standards of inference\nand epistemic justification. For instance, John may regard theological\nreasoning as intelligible. To illustrate, he points to the rational\nstructure of religious exegetical disputes. We may reject\nanother\u2019s sacred texts but think they furnish reasonable\nevaluative standards. Others may disagree: sacred texts are too\nindeterminate for adequate interpretation. Members may disagree about\nwhat counts as a good cognitive process.\n\nThe intelligibility requirement recognizes these differences in\nevaluative standards. But it still places pressure on a purely\nempirical approach. An empirical approach would count reasons as\njustificatory simply because people affirm them. But intelligibility\ndemands that our reasons for endorsing a principle meet rational\nstandards. Others must see the reason as one for the person who offers\nit, at least according to that person\u2019s standard.\n\nNot all intelligible reasons can figure into a justification for some\n\\(L\\). Some intelligible reasons are irrelevant; others only pertain\nto the benefits for oneself; still others may not be sufficient to\njustify a law, as specified in 2.1. Intelligibility is a requirement\nbeyond logical sufficiency to give reasons some epistemic credentials.\n\\(A\\)\u2019s intelligible reasons must be available to others to\nconsider at least as reasons for \\(A\\).\n2.3.2 Accessibility\n\nThe accessibility requirement is more stringent than intelligibility.\nIt does not mandate that a reason for \\(A\\) to accept \\(L\\) be\njustified according to \\(A\\)\u2019s reasonable standards. (Even if\nothers do not share these reasons). Instead, accessibility requires\nthat reasons be justified according to shared evaluative standards.\n(Members believe that \\(R_A\\) justifies \\(L\\) for \\(A\\) under common\nevaluative standards, and \\(A\\) accepts that \\(R_A\\) justifies \\(L\\).)\nAccessibility permits reasons to differ. \\((A\\) might endorse \\(R_A\\)\nand \\(B\\) might not). But it requires that they be evaluated as\nreasons according to shared evaluative standards. Thus, accessibility\nlies between intelligibility and shareability. (Which we consider\nnext, in section 2.4.3.) Intelligibility permits differing reasons and\nevaluative standards, whereas shareability permits neither.\nAccessibility is the most common standard, with at least eight\navailable interpretations. (Eberle 2002, 252\u2013286; for a recent\ndefense, see Boettcher 2015). Define accessibility and the\naccessibility requirement as follows:\n\n\nAccessibility: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is accessible to\nthe public if and only if all members of the public regard \\(R_A\\) as\njustified for \\(A\\) according to common evaluative standards\n\nAccessibility Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) a coercive law only if\n\\(R_A\\) is accessible to all members of the public.\n\n2.3.3 Shareability\n\nShareability is the strongest of the three requirements. It combines\nshared evaluative standards with the shared reasons requirement\n(Bowman and Richardson 2009; Hartley and Watson 2009; Watson and\nHartley 2018). Public reason liberals often argue that justifying\nreasons are necessarily shared. But they say little about what it\nmeans to share reasons. Public reason liberals presumably hold that\nreasons must be shareable, in that citizens have the reasons\nat the right level of idealization.\n\nLike intelligibility and accessibility, the shareability requirement\nhas two components: a requirement on the appropriate evaluative\nstandards and a requirement on the range of permitted reasons. Define\nshareability and the shareability requirement as follows:\n\n\nShareability: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) is shareable with\nthe public if and only if members of the public regard \\(R_A\\) as\njustified for each member of the public, including A, according to\ncommon standards.\n\nShareability Requirement: \\(A\\)\u2019s reason \\(R_A\\) can\nfigure in a justification for (or rejection of) coercion only if\n\\(R_A\\) is shared with all (suitably idealized) members of the\npublic.\n\n\nShareability rules out convergence approaches to public justification,\nand citizens may only use shareable reasons in their public uses of\nreason. (One could argue that members of the public share any good\nreason at high levels of idealization, and here people may even share\ntheir comprehensive doctrines. This point bleeds into the matter of\nidealization, addressed below).\n2.3.4 A Diagram\n\nIntelligibility, Accessibility, and Shareability are the three core\nstandards of justificatory reasons in the public justification\nliterature. They can be grouped together in a diagram:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nUnshared Standards\nShared Standards  \n\n\nUnshared Reasons\nIntelligibility\nAccessibility \n\nShared Reasons\nX\nShareability  \n\n\nThe bottom left quadrant is open\u2014public reason liberals never\nadvocate shared reasons and unshared evaluative standards. There are\ntwo reasons for this. First, sharing evaluative standards is more\ncommon than sharing reasons. So if reasons are shared, evaluative\nstandards should be too. Second, evaluative standards help to\nindividuate and distinguish between reasons. So it\u2019s not clear\nwe could determine which reasons are shared if evaluative standards\nare not shared.\n",
