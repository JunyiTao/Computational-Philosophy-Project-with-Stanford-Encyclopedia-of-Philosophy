This has raised social justice concerns. Perhaps cloning\ntherapies will only be a realistic option for the very rich? Some have\nreplied to this concern by pointing out that Cloning therapies may\nbecome cheaper, less labor intensive and more widely accessible after\ntime. Moreover, cloning may cure diseases and not only treat\nsymptoms. Regardless of the economic cost, it remains true of course\nthat the cloning procedure is time consuming, rendering it\ninappropriate for certain clinical applications where urgent\nintervention is required (e.g., myocardial infarction, acute liver\nfailure or traumatic or infectious spinal cord damage). If cloning for\ntherapy became available, its application would thus likely be\nrestricted to chronic conditions. Wilmut (1997), who cloned Dolly, has\nsuggested that cloning treatments could be targeted to maximize\nbenefit: an older person with heart disease could be treated with stem\ncells that are not a genetic match, take drugs to suppress her immune\nsystem for the rest of her life, and live with the side-effects; a\nyounger person might benefit from stem cells from cloned embryos that\nmatch exactly. Devolder and Savulescu (2006) have argued that\nobjections about economic cost are most forceful against\n\u2018cloning for self-transplantation\u2019 than, for example,\nagainst cloning for developing cellular models of human disease. The\nlatter will enable research into human diseases and may result in\naffordable therapies and cures for a variety of common diseases, such\nas cancer and heart disease, which afflict people all over the world.\nFinally, some have pointed out that it is not clear whether cloning\nresearch is necessarily more labor intensive than experiments on cells\nand tissues now done in animals.\n\nSome are skeptical about the claimed benefits of cloning for research\nand therapy. They stress that for many diseases in which cloned\nembryonic stem cells might offer a therapy, there are alternative\ntreatments and/or preventive measures in development, including gene\ntherapy, pharmacogenomical solutions and treatments based on\nnanotechnology. It is often claimed that other types of stem cells\nsuch as adult stem cells and stem cells from the umbilical cord blood\nmight enable us to achieve the same aims as cloning. Especially\ninduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have raised the hope that\ncloning research is superfluous (Rao & Condic 2008). iPSCs are\ncreated through genetic manipulation of a body cell. iPSCs are similar\nto embryonic stem cells, and in particular to embryonic stem cells\nfrom cloned embryos. However, iPSC research could provide tissue- and\npatient-specific cells without relying on the need for human oocytes\nor the creation and destruction of embryos. iPSC research could thus\navoid the ethical issues raised by cloning. This promise\nnotwithstanding, scientists have warned that it would be premature to\nstop cloning research as iPSCs are not identical to embryonic stem\ncells (Pera & Trounson 2013). Cloning research may teach us things\nthat iPSC research cannot teach us. Moreover, iPSC research has been\nsaid to fail to completely avoid the issue of embryo destruction\n(Brown 2009, Devolder 2015).\n",
