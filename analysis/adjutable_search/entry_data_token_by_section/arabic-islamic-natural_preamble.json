    "main_text": "\n\nNatural philosophy, or physics, in the strict sense is the study of\nnatures; however, since by \u2018nature\u2019 most medieval natural\nphilosophers meant an internal principle of change or motion that\nbelongs to something essentially, natural philosophy came to be\nidentified more specifically with the study of bodies insofar as they are subject of motion and consequently also with the\nconditions purportedly necessary for motion, such as the infinite,\nplace, void and time. Within the medieval Arabic-speaking world there\nwere two primary intellectual traditions in which natural philosophy\nwas done: kalam and falsafa. Kal\u0101m, or\nIslamic speculative theology, in general approached issues in physics\nfrom an atomistic framework, which for some of these theologians\nextended not only to the composition of bodies, but also to motion and\ntime as well, culminating among later Islamic theologians in an\noccasionalist worldview that reserved causal agency for God alone.\nFalsafa, or simply \u2018philosophy,\u2019 had its roots in\nthe Greek intellectual world and more specifically in the\nphilosophical thought of Aristotle as he was interpreted by later\nPeripatetic and Neoplatonic commentators with the additional\nsupplementation by Galen in biology and anatomy and Ptolemy in\nastronomy. The following account begins with the atomistic theories\nfound among the Islamic speculative theologians followed by the\ndevelopments in Aristotelian natural philosophy by Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers and their unique contributions to that field.\n",
