    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Life-Continuum Mind\n5.2 Life-Continuum Mind\n\n\nThe challenge posed by the need to account for the continuity of mind\nin the absence of an enduring, substantive self, was met with mixed \nsuccess by early Abhidharma authors. Thus, most \u0100bhidharmikas \nunderstood mind primarily as a species of mental cognition and, as \nsuch, explained the continuity of the mental stream as a successive \nseries of cognitive events conditioned by such factors as karmic \nformations, appropriation, and mind itself.\n\n\nThe Therav\u0101da authors extended this account of the continuity of\nthe mental stream by introducing the notion of mind as factor of \nexistence (bhava-a\u1e45ga). Thus, for the \nTherav\u0101dins, this life-continuum mind became just another factor\nconditioning the arising of cognitive awareness. The new formula for \nthis dependent arising of cognitive awareness suggest a significant \ndeparture from the basic canonical account. As Buddhagho\u1e63a \nnotes in the classical compendium of Therav\u0101da Abhidharma, the \nPath to Purity (Visuddhimagga XV, 39), \n\u201cmental awareness arises dependent on the life-continuum mind, \nmental content, and attention\u201d. But continuity in the \nlife-stream is also supported by the body, even though it is possible\nto assume the absence of bhava-a\u1e45ga in states of deep \nmeditative absorption (cf. Collins 1982, 246). Outside these rare \nstates of absorption, the bhava-a\u1e45ga-mind or mind as \nfactor of existence is essential for continuity in the life-stream. \nThe most common tropes used in this context are those of a stream or \nbeads strung together on common thread. Collins sums up rather well \nthe imagery used for explicating the function of the life-continuum \nmind:\n\n\nThe Therav\u0101da concept of bhava-a\u1e45ga, then, is\nthis: [...] the identity and continuity of one karmic unit\u2014of\none \u2018person\u2019 or \u2018individuality\u2019 within a\nlifetime, and of a single series of them [...] is guaranteed by the\nexistence of moments of bhava-a\u1e45ga-mind, which occur\nwhenever there are no moments of mental process, of conscious\nfunctioning. Each of these bhava-a\u1e45ga-mind moments, of\ncourse, is itself a separate, temporally \u2018atomic\u2019 existent\n(1982, 247).\n\n\n\nModern interpreters have proposed that we regard the function of this\nlife-continuum mind as being primarily subliminal, although its \nprecise operations are not clearly specified. Thus, Cousins (1981, \n28\u201330) and Nyayatiloka (1980, 27f) suggest that the principal \nfunction of bhava-a\u1e45ga may well be that of either \naccessing or carrying forth the dispositions, habits, and essential \ncharacteristics of the person. As such, it may not be a conditioning \nfactor for the arising of cognitive awareness, but rather merely a \nsubliminal level of mental processing.\n",
