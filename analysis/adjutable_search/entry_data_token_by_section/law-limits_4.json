    "main_text": "Legal Moralism: Restrictive Factors that Can Defeat Prima Facie Wrongs || Self-Defeat and Other Forms of Defeat\n2.4 Self-Defeat and Other Forms of Defeat\n\nThere has been much research in the intervening decades on how\nnorm-subjects will respond to any potential use of the criminal law.\nWill they endorse it, ignore it, seek to undermine it? All of this can\nmake a difference to the wisdom of criminalizing in the first place.\nTom Tyler has argued that to a large extent obedience to the law is\nbased on what is perceived by people to be legitimate and to be\nrespected. The extent to which people obey because threatened by legal\nsanctions is, by contrast, exaggerated (Tyler 2006). Paul Robinson\nstresses the need for laws to be made that do not stray too far from\nthe norms already accepted by the people. For if they do, the people\nwill not stigmatize the conduct, which may blunt or compromise the\neffectiveness of the norms in question (Robinson 2000). Similarly,\nlegal officials may find various ways of underenforcing norms if they\nstray too far from those generally accepted, again blunting their\nefficacy. Bill Stuntz points to the phenomenon of\n\u201cself-defeating crimes\u201d (Stuntz 2000). A series of factors\nof the sort have most recently been examined by Jacob Barrett and\nGerald Gaus (Barrett & Gaus 2020). The idea of potential defeating\nconditions is a highly flexible one, not a once-for-all set of\nconditions with any rigidity; the list will inevitably change and\ndevelop. A further issue of potential relevance to the question of\nwhat conduct should be criminalized (and how) focusses on the\nconsequences of applying the criminal law in given areas. There is,\nfor example, a differential impact of the criminal law on some races\nin many jurisdictions (Yankah 2019). One might add to a list of\npotential defeaters the problem that enforcement of a given proposed\nor current offence is not possible under current conditions in any\ntolerably fair way. In the United Kingdom, for example, the politician\nDavid Lammy has written a report on racial disparities across the\ncriminal justice system and proposed a principle for government of\n\u201cexplain or reform\u201d: if governments cannot provide an\nevidence-based explanation for apparent disparities, then reforms\nshould be introduced to address them (Lammy 2017).\n\nThe above discussion emphasized the legal moralist\u2019s defeating\nfactors because of their importance to the position and because, as we\nhave seen, legal moralism is sometimes misleadingly characterized\nwithout reference to them. It was also noted that Feinberg holds such\nfactors to be of crucial importance to the version of the harm\nprinciple he endorses. Such factors will surely be largely ecumenical\nas between the rival approaches.\n",
