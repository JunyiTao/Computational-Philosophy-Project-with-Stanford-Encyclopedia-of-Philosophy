    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nNietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, in R\u00f6cken (near Leipzig),\nwhere his father was a Lutheran minister. His father died in 1849, and\nthe family relocated to Naumburg, where he grew up in a household\ncomprising his mother, grandmother, two aunts, and his younger sister,\nElisabeth. Nietzsche had a brilliant school and university career,\nculminating in May 1869 when he was called to a chair in classical\nphilology at Basel. At age 24, he was the youngest ever appointed to\nthat post. His teacher Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl wrote in his letter\nof reference that Nietzsche was so promising that \u201cHe will\nsimply be able to do anything he wants to do\u201d (Kaufmann 1954:\n8). Most of Nietzsche\u2019s university work and his early\npublications were in philology, but he was already interested in\nphilosophy, particularly the work of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich\nAlbert Lange. Before the opportunity at Basel arose, Nietzsche had\nplanned to pursue a second Ph.D. in philosophy, with a project about\ntheories of teleology in the time since Kant.\n\nWhen he was a student in Leipzig, Nietzsche met Richard Wagner, and\nafter his move to Basel, he became a frequent guest in the Wagner\nhousehold at Villa Tribschen in Lucerne. Nietzsche\u2019s friendship\nwith Wagner (and Cosima Liszt Wagner) lasted into the mid-1870s, and\nthat friendship\u2014together with their ultimate break\u2014were\nkey touchstones in his personal and professional life. His first book,\nThe Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music (1872), was\nnot the careful work of classical scholarship the field might have\nexpected, but a controversial polemic combining speculations about the\ncollapse of the tragic culture of fifth-century Athens with a proposal\nthat Wagnerian music-drama might become the source of a renewed tragic\nculture for contemporary Germany. The work was generally ill-received\nwithin classical studies\u2014and savagely reviewed by Ulrich\nWilamovitz-M\u00f6llendorff, who went on to become one of the leading\nclassicists of the generation\u2014even though it contained some\nstriking interpretive insights (e.g., about the role of the chorus in\nGreek tragedy). Following the first book, Nietzsche continued his\nefforts to influence the broader direction of German intellectual\nculture, publishing essays intended for a wide public on David\nFriedrich Strauss, on the \u201cuse of history for life\u201d, on\nSchopenhauer, and on Wagner. These essays are known collectively as\nthe Untimely Meditations.\n\nAlthough he assisted in early planning for Wagner\u2019s Bayreuth\nproject and attended the first festival, Nietzsche was not favorably\nimpressed by the cultural atmosphere there, and his relationship with\nthe Wagners soured after 1876. Nietzsche\u2019s health, always\nfragile, forced him to take leave from Basel in 1876\u201377. He used\nthe time to explore a broadly naturalistic critique of traditional\nmorality and culture\u2014an interest encouraged by his friendship\nwith Paul R\u00e9e, who was with Nietzsche in Sorrento working on\nhis Origin of Moral Sensations (see Janaway 2007:\n74\u201389; Small 2005). Nietzsche\u2019s research resulted in\nHuman, All-too-human (1878), which introduced his readers to\nthe corrosive attacks on conventional pieties for which he became\nfamous, as well as to a style of writing in short, numbered paragraphs\nand pithy aphorisms to which he often returned in later work. When he\nsent the book to the Wagners early in 1878, it effectively ended their\nfriendship: Nietzsche later wrote that his book and Wagner\u2019s\nParsifal libretto crossed in the mail \u201cas if two swords\nhad crossed\u201d (EH III, HH, 5).\n\nNietzsche\u2019s health did not measurably improve during the leave,\nand by 1879, he was forced to resign his professorship altogether. As\na result, he was freed to write and to develop the style that suited\nhim. He published a book almost every year thereafter. These works\nbegan with Daybreak (1881), which collected critical\nobservations on morality and its underlying psychology, and there\nfollowed the mature works for which Nietzsche is best known: The\nGay Science (1882, second expanded edition 1887), Thus Spoke\nZarathustra (1883\u20135), Beyond Good and Evil (1886),\nOn the Genealogy of Morality (1887), and in the last year of\nhis productive life Twilight of the Idols (1888) and The\nWagner Case (1888), along with The Antichrist and his\nintellectual biography, Ecce Homo, which were published only\nlater. At the beginning of this period, Nietzsche enjoyed an intense\nbut ultimately painful friendship with R\u00e9e and Lou\nSalom\u00e9, a brilliant young Russian student. The three initially\nplanned to live together in a kind of intellectual commune, but\nNietzsche and R\u00e9e both developed romantic interest in\nSalom\u00e9, and after Nietzsche unsuccessfully proposed marriage,\nSalom\u00e9 and R\u00e9e departed for Berlin. Salom\u00e9 later\nwrote an illuminating book about Nietzsche (Salom\u00e9 [1894]\n2001), which first proposed an influential periodization of his\nphilosophical development.\n\nIn later years, Nietzsche moved frequently in the effort to find a\nclimate that would improve his health, settling into a pattern of\nspending winters near the Mediterranean (usually in Italy) and summers\nin Sils Maria, Switzerland. His symptoms included intense headaches,\nnausea, and trouble with his eyesight. Recent work (Huenemann 2013)\nhas convincingly argued that he probably suffered from a retro-orbital\nmeningioma, a slow-growing tumor on the brain surface behind his right\neye. In January 1889, Nietzsche collapsed in the street in Turin, and\nwhen he regained consciousness he wrote a series of increasingly\nderanged letters. His close Basel friend Franz Overbeck was gravely\nconcerned and travelled to Turin, where he found Nietzsche suffering\nfrom dementia. After unsuccessful treatment in Basel and Jena, he was\nreleased into the care of his mother, and later his sister, eventually\nlapsing entirely into silence. He lived on until 1900, when he died of\na stroke complicated by pneumonia.\n\nDuring his illness, his sister Elisabeth assumed control of his\nliterary legacy, and she eventually published The Antichrist\nand Ecce Homo, as well as a selection of writing from his\nnotebooks for which she used the title The Will to Power,\nfollowing Nietzsche\u2019s remark in the Genealogy\n(GM III, 27) that he planned a major work under that title.\nThe editorial work was not well founded in Nietzsche\u2019s surviving\nplans for the book and was also marred by Elisabeth\u2019s strong\nanti-Semitic commitments, which had been extremely distressing to\nNietzsche himself. As a result, The Will to Power leaves a\nsomewhat misleading impression of the general character and content of\nthe writings left in Nietzsche\u2019s notebooks. That writing is now\navailable in an outstanding critical edition (KGA, more\nwidely available in KSA; English translations of selections\nare available in WEN and WLN.)\n\nNietzsche\u2019s life has been the subject of several full-length\nbiographies (Hayman 1980, Cate 2002, Safranski 2003, Young 2010,\nPrideaux 2018), as well as speculative fictional reconstructions\n(Yalom 1992); readers can find more details about his life and\nparticular works in the entry on\n Nietzsche\u2019s Life and Works\n and in the articles comprising the first three parts of Gemes and\nRichardson (2013), as well as in Meyer (2019), which treats the\npublication strategy of Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cmiddle period\u201d\nworks (HH, D, GS).\n",
