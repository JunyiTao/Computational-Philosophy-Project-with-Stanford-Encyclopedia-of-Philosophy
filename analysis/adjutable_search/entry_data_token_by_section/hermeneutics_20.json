While \u2018postmodernism\u2019\nsignifies a number of things, of particular influence in philosophy is\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard\u2019s definition of postmodernism as an\n\u201cincredulity toward metanarratives\u201d (Lyotard,\nPostmodern Condition, xxiv). By \u2018metanarrative,\u2019\nLyotard has in mind foundational stories of modern Western philosophy,\nespecially, as these foundational stories function to legitimate\ndiscourses in the sciences (Lyotard, Postmodern Condition,\n34). Examples of metanarratives include, say, stories about the\nobjectivity of science and the contribution that science makes to the\nbetterment of society.\n\nLyotard sees both a danger and a possibility in the postmodern\nrejection of metanarratives. Lyotard maintains that postmodern\nincredulity toward metanarratives has resulted, first, in the\nincreased danger that our valuation of knowledge will be reduced to\none, totalizing standard, namely, that of an \u201cinformation\ncommodity\u201d produced and exchanged for the accumulation of wealth\nand power (Lyotard, Postmodern Condition, 5). But, he\nbelieves, the postmodern incredulity toward metanarratives has\nresulted in a new possibility, too, of liberating the creation of\nnarrative meaning from the need to establish legitimating foundations.\nPhilosophers of postmodernism have sought to clarify such a postmodern\npossibility for the creation of meaning through the development of\nhermeneutics (see Vattimo, Beyond Interpretation, Gary\nMadison 1989, John D. Caputo 1987, 2018; for a creative intervention\nin postmodern hermeneutics, see Davey 2006). In this, hermeneutics\nplaces stress on the possibility of interpretive experience to produce\nnew meaning and shifts away from concerns about truth and\nexistence.\n\nProbably the most influential conception of postmodern hermeneutics is\nembodied in Gianni Vattimo\u2019s notion of \u2018weak\nthought.\u2019 Vattimo\u2019s hermeneutics is influenced not only by\nfigures such as Gadamer and Heidegger, but also Nietzsche, as well as\nthe important Italian philosopher Luigi Pareyson (see Benso, 2018). By\n\u2018weak thought,\u2019 Vattimo has in mind interpretive practices\nthat incrementally diminish the efficacy of narratives about the\npurported \u2018being\u2019 of things that have been passed down\nfrom the tradition of Western metaphysics. Vattimo embraces the\npostmodern possibility to liberate the creation of meaning from any\nneeds for foundation or legitimacy. Building on Heidegger and\nNietzsche, Vattimo argues that despite all postmodern incredulity,\nnarratives passed down about the purported \u2018being\u2019 of\nthings continue to be in effect, often tacitly, in a broad range of\nour current beliefs and practices. What is then called for are\ninterpretive practices that loosen the hold of these narratives, and\nthus expose that what they have to say about the \u2018being\u2019\nof things are not eternal verities but, instead, mockups that are\nsubject to interpretive revision. Vattimo, then, defines interpretive\nexperience not in Gadamerian terms of a conversation that brings\nsomething into focus in its being, as it genuinely is. Rather, he\nconceives of interpretive experience as a practice of recovery, even\nconvalescence (Verwindung), that weakens the effects of\ninterpretations of \u2018being\u2019 passed down from Western\nmetaphysics. Indeed, Vattimo associates the possibility to liberate\nmeaning through weak thought as the pursuit of what he calls\n\u2018accomplished nihilism,\u2019 in that weak thought seeks to\nunmask every sense of \u2018being\u2019 which purports to be more\nthan the result of an interpretation (see Vattimo, Beyond\nInterpretation, The End of Modernity).\n",
