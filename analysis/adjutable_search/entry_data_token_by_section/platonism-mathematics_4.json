    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism? || Truth-value realism\n1.4 Truth-value realism\n\nTruth-value realism is the view that every well-formed\nmathematical statement has a unique and objective truth-value that is\nindependent of whether it can be known by us and whether it follows\nlogically from our current mathematical theories. The view also holds\nthat most mathematical statements that are deemed to be true are in\nfact true. So truth-value realism is clearly a metaphysical\nview. But unlike platonism it is not an ontological view. For\nalthough truth-value realism claims that mathematical statements have\nunique and objective truth-values, it is not committed to the\ndistinctively platonist idea that these truth-values are to be\nexplained in terms of an ontology of mathematical objects.\n\nMathematical platonism clearly motivates truth-value realism by\nproviding an account of how mathematical statements get their\ntruth-values. But the former view does not entail the latter unless\nfurther premises are added. For even if there are mathematical\nobjects, referential and quantificational indeterminacy may deprive\nmathematical statements of a unique and objective truth-value.\nConversely, truth-value realism does not by itself entail\nExistence and thus implies neither object realism nor\nplatonism. For there are various accounts of how mathematical\nstatements can come to possess unique and objective truth-values which\ndo not posit a realm of mathematical\n objects.[6]\n\nIn fact, many nominalists endorse truth-value realism, at least about\nmore basic branches of mathematics, such as arithmetic. Nominalists of\nthis type are committed to the slightly odd-sounding view that,\nalthough the ordinary mathematical statement\n\n(1)\nThere are primes numbers between 10 and 20.\n\n\nis true, there are in fact no mathematical objects and thus in\nparticular no numbers. But there is no contradiction here. We must\ndistinguish between the language \\(L_M\\) in which mathematicians make\ntheir claims and the language \\(L_P\\) in which nominalists and other\nphilosophers make theirs. The statement (1) is made in \\(L_M\\). But\nthe nominalist\u2019s assertion that (1) is true but that there are\nno abstract objects is made in \\(L_P\\). The nominalist\u2019s\nassertion is thus perfectly coherent provided that (1) is translated\nnon-homophonically from \\(L_M\\) into \\(L_P\\). And indeed, when the\nnominalist claims that the truth-values of sentences of \\(L_M\\) are\nfixed in a way that doesn\u2019t appeal to mathematical objects, it\nis precisely this sort of non-homophonic translation she has in mind.\nThe view mentioned in the previous note provides an example.\n\nThis shows that for the claim Existence to have its\nintended effect, it must be expressed in the language \\(L_P\\) used by\nus philosophers. If the claim was expressed in the language \\(L_M\\)\nused by mathematicians, then nominalists could accept the claim while\nstill denying that there are mathematical objects, contrary to the\npurpose of the claim.\n\nA small but important tradition of philosophers urge that the debate\nabout platonism should be replaced by, or at least transformed into, a\ndebate about truth-value realism. One reason offered in support of\nthis view is that the former debate is hopelessly unclear, while the\nlatter is more tractable (Dummett 1978a, pp. 228\u2013232 and Dummett\n1991b, pp. 10\u201315). Another reason offered is that the debate\nabout truth-value realism is of greater importance to both philosophy\nand mathematics than the one about\n platonism.[7]\n",
