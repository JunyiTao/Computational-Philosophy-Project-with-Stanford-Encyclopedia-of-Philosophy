    "main_text": "\n\nG\u00f3mez Pereira (1500\u2013?)\nwas a Spanish physician and philosopher who is mainly known for having\nformulated a complete theory of animal mechanism a hundred years\nbefore Descartes. In the context of the debate over the immortality of\nthe soul, he defended a radical division between the soul and the\nbody, and a conception of the soul as simple form whose essential\nactivity lies in self-consciousness. Pereira was an alumnus of the\nUniversity of Salamanca, where he met the new pedagogical methods\ndeveloped by nominalists as well as an increasing interest on natural\nphilosophy.  From a heterodox point of view, he addressed some\nphysical and metaphysical topics in his books. Pereira rejected some\nconcepts widely accepted in his time such as prime matter, common\nsense or intelligible species. Grounded upon a psychology that gave\npriority to simplicity, he replaced the scholastic theory of cognitive\nfaculties with a new one in which the intentional act became\nrelevant. For Pereira the subject and the object constitute a unity\nthat can only be conceptually separated; this unity is determined by\nthe conception of the mind as pure attention that is capable of\nperceiving itself.\n",
