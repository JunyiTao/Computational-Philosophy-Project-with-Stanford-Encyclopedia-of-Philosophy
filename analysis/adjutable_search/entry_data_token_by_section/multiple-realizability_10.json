    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || Lower Level Reductive Unity?\n2.7 Lower Level Reductive Unity?\n\nIn searching for reductive unity underlying the variety of cognitive\nsystems, Paul Churchland (1982) once recommended descending\n\u201cbelow\u201d neurobiology and even biochemistry, to the level\nof nonequilibrium thermodynamics. He insisted that finding reductive\nunity there was more than a bare logical possibility because of some\nparallels between biological processes, whose multiply realized kinds\nfind reductive unity there, and cognitive activity, especially\nlearning.\n\nConcerning Pylyshyn\u2019s (1984) attack on reductionist methodology\n(see\n \u00a71.5\n above), Patricia Churchland (1986: Chapter 9) suggests that\nfunctional theories are constructed in lower level sciences. New\nlevels of theory thus get inserted between those describing the\nstructure of the lower level kinds and those of purely functional\nkinds: between, for example, the physiology of individual neurons and\ncognitive psychology. We might find a common neurofunctional property\nfor a given type of psychological state across a wide variety of\ndistinct brains (or even the same brain over time). And if the scope\nof the macro-theory doesn\u2019t extend beyond that of its\nmicrofunctional counterpart, then reduction will be achieved despite\nvast multiple realizability at the microstructural level.\nNeurocomputational approaches that have blossomed since the early\n1990s give real empirical credence to Churchland\u2019s\nsuggestion.\n\nBickle (2003) claims that if we leave our neuroscientific\nunderstanding at the systems level, psychoneural multiple\nrealizability seems obvious. Neural systems differ significantly\nacross species. But neuroscience does not stop its inquiries at the\nsystems level. As it moves further down, into cellular physiology and\nincreasingly into the molecular biology of nervous tissue, identities\nof mechanisms across species have been found. Many molecular\nmechanisms of neural conductance, transmission, and plasticity are the\nsame, from invertebrates through mammals. This matters for psychology\nbecause mechanisms of cognition and consciousness are increasingly\nbeing found at these levels. Bickle\u2019s key example is memory\nconsolidation, the conversion of labile, easily disrupted short-term\nmemories into more durable, stable long-term form. Work with fruit\nflies, sea slugs, and mice has revealed the role of the cyclic\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP\nresponsive-element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway in key\nforms of experience-driven synaptic plasticity. Across these very\ndistinct taxa, this molecular intracellular signaling pathways has\nbeen implicated experimentally in memory consolidation. By altering a\nsingle protein in this cascade (using biotechnology and molecular\ngenetics), experimenters have built mutant organisms whose short-term\nmemory remains intact (as does their sensory, motor, and motivational\ncapacities), but which cannot consolidate these short-term memories\ninto long-term form. Bickle quotes with approval statements like the\nfollowing, from insect biologists Josh Dubnau and Tom Tully:\n\n\nIn all systems studied, the cAMP signaling cascade has been identified\nas one of the major biochemical pathways involved in modulating both\nneuronal and behavioral plasticity. \u2026 More recently,\nelucidation of the role of CREB-mediated transcription in\nlong-term memory in flies, LTP and long-term memory in vertebrates,\nand long-term facilitation in A. californica [a sea slug]\nsuggest that CREB may constitute a universally conserved molecular\nswitch for long term memory. (1998: 438)\n\n\nMemory consolidation is just one psychological phenomenon, and so its\n\u201cruthless\u201d reduction to molecular events doesn\u2019t\nestablish a general claim about unitary mechanisms across widely\ndivergent taxa for other shared cognitive kinds. For that argument,\nBickle turns to principles of molecular evolution. The first principle\nholds that evolution at the molecular level\u2014changes to the amino\nacid sequence of a given protein\u2014is much slower in functionally\nimportant (\u201cconstrained\u201d) domains than in functionally\nless important ones. The second principle is that molecular evolution\nis much slower in all domains of \u201chousekeeping\u201d proteins,\nespecially in ones that participate in cell-metabolic processes in\nmany tissue types. These two principles imply that these molecules,\ntheir domains, and the intracellular processes they participate in\nwill remain constant across existing biological species that share the\ncommon ancestor that first possessed them. (This is what Dubnau and\nTully refer to above as a \u201cuniversally conserved\u201d\nmolecular switch.) In the end, any psychological kind that affects an\norganism\u2019s behavior must engage the cell-metabolic machinery in\nindividual neurons. In the brain, causally speaking, that\u2019s\nwhere the rubber meets the road. But that\u2019s the machinery\nconserved across existing biological species\u2014changes to it,\nespecially its functionally constrained domains, have (almost)\ninevitably been detrimental to an organism\u2019s survival. So we\nshould expect that the molecular mechanisms for any causally\nefficacious cognitive kind be \u201cuniversally conserved\u201d. The\ndiscovery of these shared mechanisms of memory consolidation is not\nsome isolated case, but follows from the core principles of molecular\nevolution. As \u201cmolecular and cellular cognition\u201d proceeds,\nwe should expect more examples of unitary realizers\u2014ruthless\nreductions\u2014across species for shared psychological kinds\n",
