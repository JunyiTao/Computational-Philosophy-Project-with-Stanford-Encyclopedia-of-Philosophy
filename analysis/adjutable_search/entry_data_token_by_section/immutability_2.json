    "main_text": "The Case for Immutability\n3. The Case for Immutability\n\n\nFor one thing, the Scriptural witness is not really so clearly on the\nside of divine real intrinsic change. Much that Scripture says of God\nis clearly metaphor. And it is not hard to show that Old Testament\ntexts which ascribe change to God could be speaking metaphorically. As\nI note later, one can parse even the Incarnation in ways which avoid\ndivine real or intrinsic change. Standard Western theism clearly\nexcludes many sorts of change in God. Western theists deny that God\ncan begin or cease to be.  If God cannot, He is immutable with respect\nto existence. Nothing can gain or lose an essential property, for\nnothing can fail to have such a property.  For Western theists, God is\nby nature a spirit, without body. If he is, God cannot change\nphysically \u2014 he is physically immutable. So the Western God\ncould at most change mentally- in knowledge, will, or affect. Further,\nScripture amply supports the claim that God is perfect in knowledge,\nwill, and affect. This perfection seems to rule out many sorts of\nmental change.\n\n\nThis is a broader topic than can be tackled here; instead, let us\nexamine a few examples involving God's knowledge. If perfect in\nknowledge, God is all-knowing. If God learns something new, then\nbefore learning it, he was not all-knowing.  Even if the new fact\ncould not have been foreknown, if He did not know it, He did not know\nall. But only free beings' future actions and what depends on these\nare even\nprima facie beyond God's foreknowledge, and Scripture is full\nof claims that God foreknows free actions. If God's knowledge is\nperfect and includes complete foreknowledge, there is a sort of fact\nabout which God's knowledge is complete and unchanging. Suppose that\ntoday God knows that I will finish this article tomorrow and tomorrow\nGod knows that I am finishing the article. There is a fact\nGod knows both days, that on this particular day, referred to one day\nas \u201ctomorrow\u201d and another as \u201ctoday,\u201d I finish\nthe article. Such facts involve no real tense: they are\n\u2018tenseless\u2019 facts. If God has foreknowledge even of free\ncreaturely actions, he always knows all tenseless facts. It is a small\nstep indeed from divine perfection to necessary divine perfection. For\nit is surely more perfect to be unable not to be perfect than to be\nperfect but able not to be. Again, it is a small step from\nforeknowledge to necessary foreknowledge: the latter would be more\nperfect. (If knowledge must be \u201csafe,\u201d i.e. secure against error in\nvarying conditions, one's knowledge in one respect better if it is\nsafer, and it is maximally safe only if it is the case that\nnecessarily, if p, one knows that p.)  If God's\nknowledge is necessarily perfect, His knowledge of tenseless fact is\nimmutable.  In any possible world in which He knows a tenseless fact,\nHe always knows it, if He is necessarily omniscient.  So it is not\npossible that His knowledge of it change, though if there are possible\nworlds in which it is not a fact, there are possible worlds in which\nHe never knows it. Similarly, if God is necessarily omniscient, He\nimmutably knows all necessary truths.\n\n\nSo God's knowledge of necessary truth and knowledge of tenseless\ncontingent truth looks to be unchangeable, given only a small step\nbeyond Scripture. We can take this a step further. The only sort of\nknowledge we've left out so far is knowledge of tensed contingent\ntruths \u2014 such truths as that tomorrow I will finish the\narticle or yesterday I did finish the article. If God always\nknows the tenseless correlates of these truths \u2014 e.g., that on\nMarch 27, 2002, it is the case that I tenselessly-finish the article\non March 28, 2002 \u2014 then the sheer passage of time accounts for all\nchanges in His contingent knowledge. For which tensed truth God knows\n\u2014 that I will finish, am finishing or did finish \u2014 depends\nsimply on what time it is. So to speak, he never has to learn about\nwhether I finish on March 28; he merely has to learn where in time he\nis in relation to March 28, and this tells him what tensed\npropositions are true about my finishing.  Thus one can make a case on\nwhat are basically Scriptural grounds that God's knowledge changes at\nmost due to the bare passage of time.\n\n\nSo Scriptural considerations suggest a God at least much less\nchangeable than we in some respects. But the roots of the full DDI are\nalso philosophical. In thinking out their views of God's nature,\nWestern philosophers have largely filled out the concept of God by\nascribing to him the properties they thought he must have to count as\nabsolutely perfect. God's perfection seems to rule out many sorts of\nchange, as we've just seen. More general arguments from perfection\nconvinced classical theists that God cannot change in any way.\n\n\nIn Republic II (381b-c), Plato argued for the full DDI. He asserted\nthat a god is \u201cthe\u2026 best possible\u201d in virtue and\nbeauty. Virtue is a perfection of mind. Beauty is a non-mental\nperfection. So Plato's examples are probably meant to do duty for all\nmental and non-mental perfections, i.e. all\nperfections simpliciter. If a god is already the best\npossible in these respects, Plato reasoned, a god cannot change for\nthe better. But being perfect includes being immune to change for the\nworse \u2014 too powerful to have it imposed without permission and\ntoo good to permit it. Thus a god cannot improve or\ndeteriorate. Plato's argument had great historical influence. But it\noverlooked the possibility of changes which neither better nor worsen.\nIf one first knows that it is 11:59:59 and then knows that it is\nmidnight, is one the better or the worse for it? If the best possible\nstate of mind includes omniscience, then perhaps it includes constant\nchange in respects which neither better nor worsen God, e.g., in what\nprecise time God knows it is. Perhaps changes to \u2018keep up\nwith\u2019 time are required by a constant perfection, his\nomniscience. At 11:59:59 it is surely better to know that it is now\n11:59:59, and then at midnight it is better to know that it is now\nmidnight. Plato's argument does not rule out such changes.\n\n\nAristotle also contributed to acceptance of the full DDI. For many\nmedieval theists accepted Aristotle's case for God's existence.\nAristotle's Physics reasoned that if change occurs, it has a\nfinal source, an eternally unchanged changer. Aristotle's De\nCaelo added that something is eternally unchanged only if\nunchangeable. Later theists thought the role of first cause of change\ntoo lofty not to be God's. Writers who took Aristotle's argument or its\ndescendants to prove God's existence found themselves committed to\nDDI.\nAugustine gave a powerful impetus to Christian acceptance of DDI.\nAs he saw it (De trinitate V, 2), a God who gave His very name as \u201cI\nam\u201d and is perfect must be the perfect case of being.  But what can\nchange, Augustine thought, is not a perfect case of being: it does not\nhave its being so securely that it cannot cease to be what it is.\n\n\nBoethius' Consolation of Philosophy (V, 6) also played a role in DDI's\npopularity. He held that being in time must involve at least two\nthings which are defects.  For being temporal, as Boethius saw it,\nentailed having past and future parts of one's life. Temporal beings\nno longer live the past parts of their lives. They do not yet live the\nfuture parts of their lives. Both things are defects, according to\nBoethius. So if God is free of all defects, Boethius reasoned, then\nGod has no past or future. What has no past or future does not\nchange. For what changes goes from what it was to what it then was\ngoing to be, and so has a past and a future. Hence, to Boethius,\nperfection required changelessness. Necessary perfection \u2014 is\nbetter than contingent perfection, and so by perfect-being reasoning\nis God's.  If perfection requires changlessness, necessary perfection\nrequires being immutable. Now Boethius' reasoning requires at least\nsome cleaning up. For a life could be temporal but lack past or future\nparts, if it was instantaneous. And if one's past or future are bad,\nit is not obviously a bad thing not to be living them. But perhaps\nBoethius' argument has some merit. For it would not be a perfection of\nan individual to live for only a single temporal instant. Surely\nlonger would be better, at least if there was a good chance that the\nlonger existence would be overall good. And if God is truly perfect,\nHis life, cannot contain parts it is overall bad to live.\n\n\nBoethius actually followed his reasoning about divine perfection to\nthe conclusion that God exists outside time by his very nature \u2014\nthat God can't be temporal. For whatever has neither past nor future\nis not located in time. But change requires existence in time. Suppose\nthat a turnip, aging, goes from fresh to spoiled. It also then goes\nfrom fresh to not-fresh. So first \u201cthe turnip is fresh\u201d is\ntrue, then \u201cit is not the case that the turnip is fresh\u201d\nis true. The two cannot be true at once. So things change only if they\nexist at at least two distinct times. Hence, if God is necessarily\natemporal \u2014 via necessary divine perfection \u2014 God\nis necessarily changeless, i.e. immutable. Anselm clearly picked\nup Augustine's and Boethius' tie between perfect being and\nimmutability: he wrote in Monologion 28 that God alone exists in an\nunqualified sense and perfectly and absolutely, whereas all other\nthings nearly do not exist at all... For because of his unchangeable\neternity, it can in no way be said of (Him) because of any alteration\nthat he existed or will exist; instead, he exists in an unqualified\nsense.  Nor does he exist changeably, so that he is now something that\nat some time he was not or will not be.  Nor does he fail to be now\nwhat at some other time he was or will be.  Rather, whatever he is, he\nis once and for all, all at once, and illimitably.  And since his\nexistence is like this, he is rightly said to exist in an unqualified\nsense and absolutely and perfectly.\n\n\nAquinas (like Augustine) derived DDI from the deeper classical-theist\ndoctrine of divine simplicity (ST Ia 9). If God is simple, God has no\nparts of any sort. Now when the turnip aged, it became partly\ndifferent \u2014 its smell and texture altered. Were this not so, no\nchange would have occurred. But if the turnip had changed\nin every respect, it would not have been a case of change\neither. For it would have changed with respect to such properties\nas being a turnip and being identical with this\nturnip. And if first we have something identical with this turnip\nand then we have something not identical with this turnip, the turnip\nhas not changed, but disappeared and been replaced by something\nelse. So whatever changes must stay partly the same (else there was\nnot change in one selfsame surviving thing). So only things with parts\nor distinct aspects can change. If so, a simple God cannot\nchange. DDI's connection with divine simplicity and the classical\ntheist theory of God's perfection which centers on divine simplicity\nis one of the deepest reasons for DDI's broad historical appeal; one\ncannot fully explain what moved thinkers to accept DDI without also\ntreating the motivation for the doctrine of divine simplicity. That,\nhowever, is too large a topic to broach here.\n\nDDI, then, has a variety of religious and philosophical roots.\n",
