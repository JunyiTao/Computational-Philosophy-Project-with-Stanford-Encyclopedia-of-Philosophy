    "main_text": "Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism || Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness\n3.3 Is theological voluntarism adequately motivated?\n\nBoth with respect to the objection from God\u2019s goodness and with\nrespect to the objection from arbitrariness, the now-standard\ntheological voluntarist response is not to bite the bullet but rather\nto restrict the range of normative properties of which theological\nvoluntarism is supposed to provide an account. So Adams, Quinn, and\nAlston all recommend theological voluntarism only as a theory about\nproperties like being morally obligatory, and not about any\nother normative properties. The worry is that allowing that there is\nadequate motivation to refuse to understand these other normative\nproperties in theological voluntarist terms might commit one to\nholding that there is adequate motivation to refuse to understand\nobligation-type properties in theological voluntarist terms. Look, one\nmight say: if you are willing to hold that all moral properties other\nthan those in the obligation family are to be understood in\nnon-theological voluntarist terms, what is to stop us from holding\nthat obligation is to be understood in non-theological voluntarist\nterms as well? If we are willing to give up theological voluntarism in\nsome moral domains, why not in all of them?\n\nThe most well-developed account of why we should treat obligation as\nspecial is Adams\u2019, on which obligation is apt for theological\nvoluntarist treatment because of its intrinsic link to demands made\nwithin social relationships (Adams 1987b, and Adams 1999, pp.\n231\u2013258; see also Evans 2014, p. 27). But it is also unclear\nwhether this is persuasive. We may grant that obligations result from\ndemands, but only if we emphasize (as Adams does) that it is demands\nfrom authorities that result in obligations. But what makes\nsomeone an authority is that by his or her dictates he or she can give\nreasons for action of a certain kind. There is some dispute over what\nkind of reasons they must be, but for our purposes we can just follow\nJoseph Raz, who holds that genuine authorities give \u201cprotected\nreasons\u201d by their dictates, where a protected reason to \u03c6 is\na reason to \u03c6 and a reason to disregard some reasons against\n\u03c6-ing. If one is an authority over another with respect to\n\u03c6-ing, then one\u2019s dictate that the other \u03c6 is a\nprotected reason for the other to \u03c6 (Raz 1979, p. 18).\n\nBut now here is the question. We agree that obligations arise from\nauthoritative dictates. And we agree that for a dictate to be\nauthoritative is for it to constitute a certain sort of reason, let us\nsay a protected one. But why, then, would we identify obligations with\nprotected reasons that result from demands, rather than (as Raz does)\nwith protected reasons themselves, whatever their source? If, after\nall, there were other ways of producing protected reasons other than\nthrough the giving of commands, what would be the point of saying\n\u2018oh, but though there is a protected reason to \u03c6, it\nisn\u2019t really obligatory to \u03c6.\u2019 Surely if\nthere were any point to this remark it would be purely verbal, and of\nno philosophical / normative interest.\n\nIt turns out, then, that whether Adams\u2019 move is enough to\nmotivate theological voluntarism about obligation is dependent on\nwhether there are in fact any protected reasons (or reasons of\nwhatever structure that one thinks that authoritative dictates must\ngive) that are not dependent on demands being made. If there are such\nreasons\u2014which natural law theorists, for example, would\nhold\u2014then Adams\u2019 gambit will not work, and the theological\nvoluntarist will have to look elsewhere for motivation to understand\nobligation in those terms.\n\nNow, one might say that by appealing to the idea that obligations\narise from demands made within social relationships as the basis for\nthe theological voluntarist\u2019s account of moral obligation, we\nare misconstruing the key claim that they make about the social nature\nof obligation. The social nature of obligation, voluntarists might\nretort, first and foremost concerns the fact that when one is under an\nobligation, there is someone else who is entitled to hold one\naccountable for failures to adhere to the content of that obligation\n(Adams 1999, p. 233; Evans 2013, p 14). In the case of the moral law,\nthe party who has standing to hold us accountable is God.\n\nEven if one accepts this claim about the nature of obligation \u2014\nit has some plausibility, as there is some basis for holding that not\neverything that one has protected reason to do counts as obligatory\n\u2014 and the claim that only God has adequate standing to hold us\naccountable for adhering to morality, it is still not at all clear how\nto provide a satisfactory rationale for a theological voluntarist view\nof moral obligation. For theological voluntarism with respect to moral\nobligations holds that the existence of moral obligations depends on\nGod\u2019s bringing them about via God\u2019s command or some other\nact of divine will; but there is no obvious argument for the view that\nGod\u2019s being essential to holding us accountable for following\nthe norms of morality entails God\u2019s commanding or willing those\nmoral norms into existence. Even if we grant, then, to the theological\nvoluntarists their desired premises regarding the social character of\nobligation and God\u2019s ideal status as someone to hold us\naccountable for adhering to the norms of morality, theological\nvoluntarists still have a worrisome gap to overcome in offering\npositive reasons to affirm that view.\n",
