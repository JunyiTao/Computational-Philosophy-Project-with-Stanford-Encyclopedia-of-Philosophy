Wendy McElroy, an equity\nfeminist writes:\n\n\nI\u2019ve always maintained that the only reason I call myself a\nfeminist is because of [the] gov[ernment]. By which I mean, if the\ngovernment (or an anarchist defense assoc[iation]) acknowledged the\nfull equal rights of women without paternalistic protection or\noppression, I would stop writing about women\u2019s issues. (McElroy\n1998c\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nFeminism\u2019s political role involves assuring that women\u2019s\nright against coercive interference by private individuals is\nrecognized and protected by the state (for example women\u2019s right\nagainst groping on the street or rape within marriage (McElroy\n1991b)), and that women\u2019s right against coercive interference by\nthe state itself is respected. The latter means feminists should\nobject to laws that restrict women\u2019s liberty in particular (for\nexample laws that limit women\u2019s employment options (Taylor 1992:\n228)), and laws that protect women in particular (for example laws\ngranting preferential treatment to women (Paul 1989)). Equity\nfeminists suggest that this has been largely accomplished in countries\nlike the United States. Joan Kennedy Taylor explains: feminism\u2019s\n\u201cgoal of equal political liberty for women has been pretty much\nreached in the United States\u201d (Taylor 2001; see also Sommers\n1994: 274).\n2.2.1 Equity Feminism on the Oppression of Women\n\nOn the equity feminist view, the feminist slogan \u201cthe personal\nis political\u201d is accurate when the state fails to recognize\nwomen\u2019s right against coercive interference, especially in\nwomen\u2019s personal lives. So, for example, in some countries\nhusbands have legal control over their wives\u2019 persons and\nproperty. (Some equity feminists argue that the women\u2019s movement\nin Western countries should not hesitate to criticize countries in\nwhich this occurs (Sommers 2007).) But in countries like the United\nStates, where the right of women against this sort of coercive\ninterference is recognized and protected by law, equity feminists hold\nthat \u201cthe personal is no longer political\u201d (Lehrman 1997:\n5; see also 21).\n\nIf an individual or group of individuals suffers sustained and\nsystematic denial of their rights, on the equity feminist view, we may\ncall them oppressed. Women were oppressed in the United States during\nmost of its first two centuries; people of African descent were\noppressed before the dismantling of Jim Crow laws. While the culture\nof the United States supported this denial of rights, equity feminists\nhold that the oppressor was the state (McElroy 1998cc\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n which refused to recognize and protect the right of women and people\nof African descent to treatment as self-owners. When the state\nrecognizes and protects this right of women and Americans of African\ndescent, they are no longer oppressed, even if the culture\ndisadvantages them. So, for example, in a discussion of whether Muslim\nwomen are oppressed, Cathy Young focuses on whether women\u2019s\nconformity with a religious tradition that subordinates them is\nenforced by law. If it is, then women are oppressed (C. Young\n2006).\n\nIf women are to be described as currently oppressed in societies like\nthe United States, on the equity feminist view, one must show that the\nstate fails to protect women, as a group, from sustained and\nsystematic rights violations. Some feminists have argued that violence\nagainst women is pervasive in societies like the United States so\nthat, even though the law recognizes women\u2019s right against it,\nthat right is insufficiently protected and thus women endure sustained\nand systematic denial of their right to bodily integrity (Dworkin\n1991). Equity feminists endeavor to refute this claim by showing that\nthe prevalence of violence against women has been exaggerated. For\nexample Rita Simon contests the claim that as many as 154 out of 1,000\nwomen have been raped. On her accounting, the number is closer to 19\nper 1,000; and \u201crape is less common than other violent\ncrimes\u201d (Simon 2002: 235). In addition, she claims, \u201cthe\ncriminal justice system does not ignore or make light of crimes\nagainst females\u201d (2002: 236). Katie Roiphe argues that date rape\nis not a significant threat to women (Roiphe 1994). Concurring with\nRoiphe, Cathy Young writes:\n\n\nwomen have sex after initial reluctance for a number of\nreasons.\u2026 [F]ear of being beaten up by their dates is rarely\nreported as one of them. (C. Young 1992)\n\n\nWomen have also been said to be oppressed because their right to be\ntreated the same as men by employers, educational institutions, and\nassociations has been violated in a sustained and systematic way. That\nis, some argue, women have been regularly denied the right to equal\naccess to opportunities because they are women. Equity feminists\ngenerally hold that no rights are violated when employers, educational\ninstitutions, public accommodations or associations discriminate\nagainst women. Nonetheless, equity feminists argue that discrimination\nagainst women is not a serious problem. Diana Furchtgott-Roth and\nChristine Stolba argue that \u201ccomplaints about systematic\neconomic discrimination against women simply do not square with the\nevidence\u201d (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xi; see also\n2001). They argue that \u201cwomen\u2019s wages and education levels\nare closing the gap with those of men\u201d (1999: xii). In addition,\nStolba and Furchtgott-Roth claim that women have \u201csurpassed men\nin education\u201d (23; see also 23\u201343). Christina Hoff Sommers\nconcurs, arguing that, rather than failing to provide girls with an\neducation equal to that of boys, our current educational system\ndisproportionately benefits girls (Sommers 2000: 20\u201323,\n178).\n\nEquity feminists argue that the differences in outcomes between women\nand men can be explained, not by violence against women and sex\ndiscrimination, but by differences in the preferences of women and men\n(Epstein 2002: 33; Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii). \u201cIn\nmany cases where women remain behind men, personal choices explain\noutcomes more readily than does overt discrimination\u201d (Stolba\n& Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii). To be sure, classical-liberal\nfeminists hold that women and men are sufficiently the same that they\nhave the \u201csame political interests\u201d, in particular the\ninterest in being treated as a self-owner (McElroy 2002a:\n14\u201315). But, for some equity feminists, biological differences\nbetween the sexes largely explain the sex segregation in the workplace\nand in family roles still common in countries like the United States\n(Epstein 2002; Lehrman 1997: 5, 31).\n\nOther equity feminists think biological sex differences alone do not\nexplain this phenomenon (C. Young 2004). Women\u2019s preferences may\nreflect the effects of socialization or incentives: for example women\nmay be socialized to prefer stereotypically female roles, or the\nrewards associated with such roles for women may provide motivation\nfor women to take them up. But equity feminists hold that, because\nwomen are not legally required, or actually forced in some other way,\nto choose traditional roles, their choices are not coerced and thus\nstate remedies are inappropriate. On the equity feminist view, a law\nprohibiting women from becoming surgeons is coercive because it\nconstitutes a threat of loss of liberty or property. But if one is\nsocialized to prefer stay-at-home motherhood, or one discovers that\none prefers to stay home with children given the other real options,\none may still choose to become a surgeon without risking loss of\nliberty or property. As Stolba and Furchtgott-Roth put it (using the\nword \u201cprevents\u201d in a very strong sense): \u201cNothing\nprevents women from choosing the surgical specialty\u201d\n(Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: 60; my emphasis).\n2.2.2 Feminism\u2019s Nonpolitical Role\n\nWhile equity feminists hold that feminism\u2019s political\ntask\u2014securing for women the right to freedom from coercive\ninterference\u2014is nearly completed, some equity feminists believe\nthat feminism has a nonpolitical role to play in\nwomen\u2019s personal lives. In its nonpolitical role, feminism can\nhelp women to develop character traits and strategies that will help\nthem benefit from their freedom; and it can help women to navigate\npersonally among their increasing options.\n\nKaren Lehrman writes:\n\n\nMen have typically held title to quite a few traits that women can now\nput to good use. In addition to ambition, assertiveness, and\nindependence, there\u2019s also decisiveness. (Lehrman 1997: 33; see\nalso 62)\n\n\nOther character traits emphasized by equity feminists include\n\u201cself-confidence\u201d (Stevens et al. 2002: 255), being able\nto think and argue independently (McElroy 1998a), and taking\nresponsibility for oneself (Taylor 1992: 86). Some equity feminists\nsuggest that feminism offers individual women and men the opportunity\nfor freedom from conformity with sex roles (Lehrman 1997: 6; Taylor\n1992: 23\u201324).\n\nEquity feminists recommend strategies for success for women in\neducation and employment as alternatives to state regulation. In male\ndominated fields, for example, equity feminists recommend that women\nmentor one another or organize supportive associations, making use of\nthe techniques of 1960\u2019s feminism like consciousness-raising\n(Taylor 1992: 100\u2013101). Some recommend that, instead of being\nambivalent about work outside of the home, women should \u201clean\nin\u201d to it (Sandberg 2013). In What You Can Do About Sexual\nHarassment When You Don\u2019t Want to Call the Cops, Joan\nKennedy Taylor argues that women can avoid sexual harassment or lessen\nits impact if they learn to diffuse conflicts with men and understand\nthe role of sexual banter in male culture (Taylor 1999). Equity\nfeminists also recommend that women make full use of their right to\ncontract by turning their preferences\u2014for example the preference\nfor being paid and/or promoted on the basis of one\u2019s job\nperformance and not on the basis of sexual favors\u2014into rights\nthrough contract (Epstein 2002: 40; Taylor 1992: 169).\n\nSome equity feminists stress that women need not give up their gender\ndifference to benefit from their freedom (Lehrman 1997: 198). As Karen\nLehrman writes, \u201ccompleting the feminist\nrevolution\u2026primarily involves [women] completing their own\npersonal evolutions\u201d (1997: 35). Lehrman quotes Elizabeth Cady\nStanton:\n\n\nthe strongest reason for giving woman \u2026 a complete emancipation\nfrom all forms of bondage of custom, dependence, superstition \u2026\nis the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual\nlife. (1997: 201, quoting \u201cThe Solitude of Self\u201d\n[1892])\n\n\nAn important part of this individual life, on Lehrman\u2019s view, is\nnavigating among sexual difference and sameness in the personal\nconstruction of a satisfying life.\n2.2.3 Socially Conservative Equity Feminism\n\nSome equity feminists are socially conservative (Morse 2001; Sommers\n2000). To be sure, equity feminism as described here is a form of\nclassical-liberalism. As such it involves the claim that traditional\nvalues should not be imposed on citizens by the state. For example,\nthe state should not tax citizens to support institutions that promote\ntraditional values; nor should the criminal or civil law create\nincentives for adherence to such values. But some equity feminists\nhold that it is best when citizens voluntarily adhere to traditional\nvalues. They hold that widespread voluntary adherence to traditional\nvalues is conducive to well-being in society because traditional\nvalues make possible the reproduction of independent and\n\u201cself-restraining citizens\u201d who are \u201cthe basis of\nfree institutions, both economic and political\u201d (Morse 2001:\n161).\n\nSocially conservative equity feminists do not take the classical\nliberal theory of the limits of state power to imply endorsement of a\nlibertine cultural ethos. So, for example, while socially conservative\nequity feminists hold that the state should not force citizens to\naccept traditional family forms (because individuals have a right\nagainst such coercive interference), they hold that society should\nstrongly discourage disfavored ways of life and encourage favored ones\nthrough noncoercive, nonstate means. Socially conservative equity\nfeminists hold that when feminism strays from its political role of\nassuring equal rights and ventures into women\u2019s personal lives\nit tends to discourage in women the kinds of delayed gratification and\nself-sacrifice on which vital social institutions, like the family,\ndepend (Morse 2001: 133).\n\nTo be sure, there are political conservatives who take equity\nfeminism\u2019s claim that women and men should be treated the same\nby the law as a rule of thumb. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese is an example of\nsuch a political conservative (Fox-Genovese 1991; 1996). The\ndifference between political conservatives who embrace the equity\nfeminist account of women\u2019s equality and socially conservative\nequity feminists is that the former endorse the use of state power to\npromote traditional values while the latter do not. Also, socially\nconservative equity feminists hold that individuals\u2019 political\nrights derive from their status as self-owners (Morse 2001: 57) while\npolitical conservatives hold that citizens\u2019 political rights\nderive from their status as members of communities (Fox-Genovese 1991:\n9). In contemporary popular political discourse it is often hard to\ndistinguish these two, as they are in political coalition. To appeal\nto both classical liberal and socially conservative constituencies, on\noccasion theorists help themselves to a bit of both traditions. For\nexample, Jennifer Roback Morse identifies herself as a libertarian:\n\u201cWhen the topic is the proper relationship between the\nindividual and the state, libertarianism is pretty much the right\npath\u201d (Morse 2001: 4). But she also makes the un-libertarian and\npolitically conservative recommendation that the state should\nintervene in personal relationships by making it \u201ccostly to\ndivorce\u201d (2001: 164, see also 104, 111).\n2.3 Cultural Libertarian Feminism\n\nCultural libertarianism is a form of classical liberalism that is\n\n\nconcerned about constraints on individual freedom from government as\nwell as from traditionalist familial, religious, and community\ninstitutions\u2014the same civil institutions that conservatives see\nas necessary for ordered liberty to thrive. (C. Young 2007)\n\n\nCultural libertarian feminism holds that these institutions reflect\nthe patriarchal nature of society and oppress women. Thus cultural\nlibertarian feminism recognizes sources of women\u2019s oppression\nother than the state (Presley 2000; Long & Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n As Charles Johnson and Roderick Long put it, patriarchal culture and\nthe state are \u201cinterlocking systems of oppression\u201d (Long\n& Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n both of which should be opposed by feminists. They explain:\n\n\nThere is nothing inconsistent or un-libertarian in holding that\nwomen\u2019s choices under patriarchal social structures can be\nsufficiently \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in the libertarian sense, to be\nentitled to immunity from coercive legislative interference, while at\nthe same time being sufficiently \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d in a\nbroader sense, to be recognized as morally problematic and as a\nlegitimate target of social activism. (Long & Johnson\n2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nCalling this view \u201canarchist feminism\u201d, Sharon Presley\nwrites: \u201cWhat the anarchist feminists are calling for is a\nradical restructuring of society, both in its public and private\ninstitutions\u201d (Presley 2000). Such feminists hold that much of\nthe oppression women currently suffer is noncoercive, however. Laws\nagainst prostitution are coercive\u2014the state can put a violator\nin jail or force her to pay a fine. But on the cultural libertarian\nfeminist view much of the pressure to conform to gender roles is not\ncoercive. Noncoercive oppression can be resisted, although it is often\nnot easy to do so. Cultural libertarian feminists hold that\nnoncoercive oppression should not be remedied by the state (see also\nTomasi 2009). As Presley and Kinsky explain, on the cultural\nlibertarian view, to try to remedy the noncoercive oppression of women\nwith coercive state action \u201cjust changes the sort of oppression,\nnot the fact\u201d (Presley & Kinsky 1991: 78). This oppression\nshould be opposed by a nonviolent movement for feminist social\nchange.\n\nCultural libertarian feminists target the patriarchal culture by, for\nexample, developing in individuals (especially women) the ability to\nbe independent. This involves enabling individuals to resist authority\nand think for themselves (Presley 2001). Cultural libertarian\nfeminists also recommend the development of more deeply consensual\nrelationships and institutions (Heckert 2004\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n relationships and institutions in which there is an equality of\nauthority (Long 2001\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n While some equity feminists (see\n \u00a71.2)\n would applaud this work, they would call it \u201cpersonal\u201d,\nreserving the term \u201cpolitical\u201d for the work of securing\nfor women their right against coercive interference. Equity feminist\nWendy McElroy writes:\n\n\nI understand that there is a cultural form of feminism and many women\nwould still fight for improved prestige or status, and I\nwouldn\u2019t criticis[e] them for doing so. It just wouldn\u2019t\ngrip me. Guess I\u2019m a political animal after all. (McElroy\n1998c\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nBut cultural libertarian feminists consider this work to be an\nintegral part of a larger political struggle for women\u2019s\nfreedom.\n2.4 Anti-Discrimination Law and Preferential Treatment\n\nClassical-liberal feminism requires same treatment of women and men\nunder just law. This means that sex discrimination by the state, for\nexample when the state functions as an employer, is impermissible\n(Block 1991: 102; Epstein 2002: 34; Warnick 2003: 1608). But\nclassical-liberal feminists oppose laws that prohibit discrimination\nagainst women by nonstate actors, for example in employment,\neducation, public accommodations, or associations (McElroy 1991b:\n22\u201323; Epstein 2002). They hold that the interaction of citizens\nshould be subject to state control only to the extent necessary to\nprotect citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference.\nBusinesses violate citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference\nif they steal from their customers or employees; associations violate\nit if they extort their members; colleges violate it if they kidnap\nstudents. But businesses do not violate this right if they refuse to\ndo business with women, pay women less for the same work, or create a\nworking environment that is hostile to them because of their sex.\nPrivate educational institutions do not violate this right if they\nrefuse to educate girls or women, offer them an inferior education, or\ncreate a learning environment that is hostile to them because of their\nsex. Business and professional associations do not violate this right\nif they refuse to admit women as members or make them feel unwelcome\nbecause of their sex.\n\nClassical-liberal feminism, as described here, clearly implies\nrejection of the legal prohibition against private discrimination in\nemployment, education, public accommodations, and associations. But in\nthe literature one finds a range of views. Some categorically reject\nany legal protection against private discrimination (Taylor 1992: 62).\nOthers accept basic protections such as those afforded in U.S. law by\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nand Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972; but reject more\nrobust protections, such as non-remedial affirmative action or\ncomparable worth (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 179; see also\n107\u2013108).\n\nClassical-liberal feminism holds that private businesses, educational\ninstitutions, and associations are free to give or withhold\npreferential treatment to women. But the state may not treat women\npreferentially because the state must treat citizens the same\nregardless of sex. Nor may the state require that private businesses,\neducational institutions, or associations treat women preferentially.\nThis is because, on the classical-liberal feminist view, failure to\ntreat women preferentially is not a violation of anyone\u2019s right\nagainst coercive interference. Examples of preferential treatment\nunder the law, which classical-liberal feminists oppose, include\naffirmative action in employment and education (Lehrman 1997: 25),\ncomparable worth (Paul 1989) and advantages for women in the legal\ntreatment of custody and domestic violence (Simon 2002).\n\nWhile classical-liberal feminists resist state remedies for private\ndiscrimination against women, they also hold that such discrimination\nis not currently a serious problem in countries like the United\nStates. In addition, they argue,\n\n\neven where discrimination may exist, we find little, if any, evidence\nthat expanded government intervention would serve any useful purpose.\n(Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii)\n\n\nand speculate that freer markets would make whatever discrimination\ncurrently takes place even more rare (McElroy 2002b, 187).\n2.5 Justification\n\nMuch of the classical-liberal feminist literature, especially the\nequity feminist literature, is written for public policy and popular\naudiences, so emphasis is on policy implications rather than\nphilosophical justifications. Nonetheless, we find in the literature a\nvariety of justifications, some consequentialist and some\nnon-consequentialist.\n\nThe most common justification offered in the classical-liberal\nfeminist literature is consequentialist. This argument says that the\npolitical arrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as\ncompared with the alternatives, will provide women with more of what\nis good for them: for example safety, income and wealth, and options.\nLiberalizing guns laws will make women safer (Stevens, et al. 2002);\nlegalizing prostitution and pornography will improve the lives of\nwomen in those trades (Almodovar 2002; Strossen 2000) and open\nopportunities for others; freer markets will root out discrimination\nagainst women and stimulate the proliferation of amenities essential\nto working women, like daycare centers (Epstein 2002: 33; Paul 2002:\n208\u2013209; Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 124, 180; Conway\n1998). Indeed, some argue that liberalizing the market will release\nsuch an \u201cexplosion of prosperity\u201d that women will not need\nhelp from a welfare state (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nA variety of non-consequentialist arguments are offered as well. Kirp,\nYudof, and Franks, for example, refer to Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative and claim that treating individuals as self-owners is what\nis meant by treating individuals as ends in themselves ((Kirp, et al.\n1986: 13\u201314). Wendy McElroy grounds her thought in the natural\nlaw tradition (McElroy 1998b). Some imply a perfectionist\njustification according to which the perfection of the human being\nrequires being treated as a self-owner (Presley 2001).\n2.6 Criticism\n\nSome criticism of classical-liberal feminism addresses the\nconsequentialist argument offered in support of classical-liberal\nfeminism. The consequentialist argument says that the political\narrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as compared with the\nalternatives, will provide women with more of what is good for them\n(see\n \u00a72.5).\n Following Ashlie Warnick, we can distinguish the claim that\nparticular liberty-restricting policies are bad for women (and that\nsome liberty-enhancing policies are good for women) from the claim\nthat all liberty-restricting policies harm women, or that a minimal\nstate (or no state) would be better for women overall (Warnick 2003).\nIt is surely possible to cite liberty-restricting policies that are\nbad for women\u2014laws limiting women\u2019s employment\noptions\u2014and thus to cite liberty-enhancing policies that are\ngood for women\u2014not having such laws. But it is also possible to\ncite liberty-restricting policies that are good for women\u2014for\nexample the legal prohibition against sex discrimination in\nemployment, education, and public accommodations (which\nclassical-liberal feminists recommend dismantling (see\n \u00a72.4)).\n Of course, if sex discrimination is rare, as some classical-liberal\nfeminists contend (see\n \u00a72.2.1),\n laws prohibiting it will not produce much benefit. But, as\negalitarian-liberal feminists Deborah Rhode and Ann Cudd argue, sex\ndiscrimination remains a significant problem (Rhode 1997: 156; Cudd\n2006: 140\u2013142). Think also of the classical-liberal feminist\nrecommendation that women and men be treated exactly the same by the\nstate (see\n \u00a72.1\n and\n \u00a72.4).\n While different treatment can stigmatize and entrench stereotypes,\nsame treatment can disadvantage women if they are not similarly\nsituated to men\u2014which, arguably, is the case (Minow 1990). So\nthe larger case\u2014that all liberty-restricting policies harm\nwomen, or that a minimal state (or no state) would be better for women\noverall\u2014has not been made convincingly (Warnick 2003). Another\nconcern about the larger case is that much of the support offered is\nspeculative, for example Roderick Long\u2019s assertion that\n\u201cthe explosion of prosperity\u201d classical liberal\narrangements would bring about \u201dwould go a long way toward\nproviding women with an economic safety net more effective than any\ngovernment welfare program\u201d (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome criticism addresses non-consequentialist arguments for\nclassical-liberal feminism. These arguments say that, regardless of\nthe consequences, women and men should be treated as self-owners with\nrights to property justly acquired and to freedom from coercive\ninterference because this is what they deserve as ends in themselves,\nbecause this is what insight into natural law teaches, or because this\nis what their perfection requires (see\n \u00a72.5).\n Critics contend that even if we concede the relevant\nclassical-liberal premises\u2014that women and men should be treated\nin ways they deserve as ends in themselves, or as natural law teaches,\nor in ways their perfection requires\u2014it does not follow that the\nstate should treat individuals merely as self-owners entitled only to\nproperty justly acquired and freedom from coercive interference. For\nexample, egalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that treating\nindividuals as ends in themselves requires legal measures to protect\nwomen\u2019s personal and political autonomy\u2014measures such as\nanti-discrimination law, workplace changes to accommodate caregiving\nresponsibilities, and adequate material means (see\n \u00a71.1.4\n and\n \u00a71.2.1).\n Since classical-liberal feminism rejects such measures,\negalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that it fails to treat women as\nends in themselves. Also, that treating individuals as ends in\nthemselves means treating them as entitled merely to protection from\ncoercive interference is plausible only if one ignores the fact of\nhuman dependency. By the fact of human dependency is meant the fact\nthat all human beings are utterly dependent on the caregiving of\nothers for many years at the start of life, that many come to need the\ncaregiving of others due to temporary or permanent disability later in\nlife, and that many require caregiving when they become infirm at the\nend of life; and also, that those who provide caregiving for those who\ncannot care for themselves become dependent on others for support\n(Kittay 1995: 10). If human beings are dependent in these ways, then\ntreating them as ends in themselves will, at least for some of the\ntime, mean something other than merely leaving them alone. Failure to\nrecognize this suggests that classical-liberal feminism assumes that\nthere is a nonpolitical \u201crealm of private life in which the\nreproductive and nurturant needs of human beings are taken care\nof\u201d (Okin 1989: 75). Such an assumption makes it impossible to\nevaluate the justice of the arrangements under which caregiving is\ngiven and received and removes from our consideration the nature of\nobligations to, and entitlements of, members of society who require\ncaregiving to survive and thrive. Some worry that one form of\nclassical liberalism\u2014libertarianism\u2014seriously\nmisunderstands the political relevance of caregiving because it\nconstrues one key caregiving arrangement, the parent-child\nrelationship, as one of ownership (see Okin 1989: 80\u201385; see\nalso Nozick 1974; Andersson 2007; and Jeske 1996). As Jennifer Roback\nMorse, herself a libertarian puts it: \u201dI think it is well to\nadmit\u2026 that our inattention to family life and community\nresponsibility has left libertarians open to the charge that we do not\ncare very much about these matters\u201d (Morse 2001: 28).",
