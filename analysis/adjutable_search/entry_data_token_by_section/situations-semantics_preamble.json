    "main_text": "\n\nSituation semantics was developed as an alternative to possible worlds\nsemantics. In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are\nevaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There\nis no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no\nconsensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some,\nsituations are structured entities consisting of relations and\nindividuals standing in those relations. According to others,\nsituations are particulars. In spite of unresolved foundational\nissues, the partiality provided by situation semantics has led to some\ngenuinely new approaches to a variety of phenomena in natural language\nsemantics. In the way of illustration, this article includes\nrelatively detailed overviews of a few selected areas where situation\nsemantics has been successful: implicit quantifier domain\nrestrictions, donkey pronouns, and exhaustive interpretations. It\nmoreover addresses the question of how Davidsonian event semantics can\nbe embedded in a semantics based on situations. Other areas where a\nsituation semantics perspective has led to progress include attitude\nascriptions, questions, tense, aspect, nominalizations, implicit\narguments, point of view, counterfactual conditionals, and discourse\nrelations.\n",
