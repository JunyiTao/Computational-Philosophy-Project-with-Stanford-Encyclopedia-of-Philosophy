    "main_text": "Early translations into Arabic\n2. Early translations into Arabic\n\nAlready in Damascus, under the Umayyads, some philosophical writings\nhad been translated into Arabic. Salim Abu l-\u02bfAla\u2019,\nsecretary to the caliph Hisham ibn \u02bfAbd al-Malik (r.\n724\u2013743), initiated the translation of the pseudo-Aristotelian\nletters on government to Alexander the\n Great.[12]\n This collection forms the nucleus of the most famous among the\n\u201cmirrors for princes\u201d, the Sirr al-asrar\n(Grignaschi 1967, 1976; Manzalaoui 1974), known in the Latin Middle\nAges and early modern times as the Secretum\n secretorum.[13]\n One of the Arabic translations of the pseudo-Aristotelian De\nMundo also traces back to this period (Grignaschi 1965\u201366).\nHowever, it was under the \u02bfAbbasids (750\u20131258), and in\nparticular in the first two centuries of their caliphate, that the\ntranslations blossomed.\n\nApparently, the first translations of the \u02bfAbbasid era were\nproduced under the caliphate of al-Mansur (r. 754\u2013775): his\nsecretary Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf (d.\n 756)[14]\n is credited with the translation (or production) of a compendium of\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge, plus the Categories,\nDe Intepretatione and Prior\n Analytics.[15]\n It has been contended (Gabrieli 1932, Kraus 1934) that this\nauthorship rests on a mistake and that this work should be attributed\nto his son, Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbdallah al-Muqaffa\u02bf (fl.\nunder the reign of al-Ma\u2019mun, see below); however, other\nscholars accept the father\u2019s\n authorship,[16]\n with the result that a companion of Aristotelian logic was already\navailable in the first decades of the \u02bfAbbasid caliphate, under\nthe ruler who founded Baghdad (762). His son and successor al-Mahdi\n(r. 775\u2013785) had the Topics translated for him by the\nNestorian Patriarch Timothy I (d.\n 823).[17]\n It has been advanced that the ancient Arabic translation of the\nRhetoric, \u201cedited\u201d by Ibn al-Samh (d.\n 1027),[18]\n traces back to the 8th century (Aouad 1989c, 456\u20137). Under the\nreign of Harun al-Rashid (r. 786\u2013809) a translation of\nAristotle\u2019s Physics was made by a certain Sallam\n al-Abrash.[19]\n Neither translation has come down to us.\n",
