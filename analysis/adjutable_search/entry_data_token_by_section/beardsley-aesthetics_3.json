    "main_text": "Art as Essentially Institutional\n4. Art as Essentially Institutional\n\nOne view that Beardsley certainly did think unacceptable, even if, as\nhe later came to realize, his own early position wouldn\u2019t do, is\nthat works of art are \u201cessentially institutional\u201d.\nDepending on the context, this could be a claim either about the\ndefinition of \u201cart\u201d or about the ontology of art.\nBeardsley rejects both claims, but it\u2019s important to distinguish\nthem.\n\nIn speaking of money as \u201cessentially institutional\u201d, a\nperson is probably claiming no more than that the definition or truth\nconditions of \u201cthis is money\u201d include a reference to\nsocial institutions. The claim isn\u2019t that quarters, dimes,\nnickels, and so on fall under a distinct ontological category other\nthan physical objects, namely, cultural or institutional objects.\n\nIf taken ontologically, on the other hand, the force of the claim is\nthat a work of art isn\u2019t a physical object but a different kind\nof object altogether, an object whose nature and existence are in part\nconstituted by culture, tradition, or social institutions. Arthur\nDanto\u2019s distinction between artworks and \u201cmere real\nthings\u201d(1981, 1), with beds and ties being paradigms of mere\nreal things, suggests just such an ontological distinction. For Danto,\nit\u2019s (1) theories of art and (2) the \u201caboutness\u201d of\nart, or the fact that art is necessarily subject to interpretation,\nthat make mere real things transform, so to speak, into artworks, and\ngain a new ontological status. The nature of a theory of art is never\nspelled out by Danto, but apparently all such theories require an\nobject to be properly placed in an \u201cartworld\u201d to be a work\nof art, and not just anyone, at any time, can do such placing. But\neven if the indefinite and unexplained nature of Danto\u2019s key\nconcepts is put aside, and the fact that many works of art (for\nexample, a typical concerto) don\u2019t seem to be about anything at\nall, or subject to interpretation in any significant sense (at least\nuntil something for it to be about or interpreted in terms of is\ncooked up, such as that it\u2019s about the very notes being played,\nor that it comments on the history of concertos)\u2014even if\nthat\u2019s also put aside, it\u2019s hard to see how (1) and (2)\ncan effect ontological transformations, how things which are otherwise\nphysical objects become, ontologically speaking, different objects.\nRather, Beardsley thinks, what (1) and (2) suggest is that if a\nphysical object is a work of art, it has, or at least can have,\nproperties it wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. If a person\u2019s a\npoliceman, he has properties\u2014being able to arrest people, for\nexample\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, but a policeman\nhas whatever ontological status a person has, no more and no less.\nReceiving a certificate from the police academy and putting on a badge\nmay \u201ctransform\u201d a man, but a new object, an essentially\ninstitutional or cultural object, a policeman, doesn\u2019t enter the\nworld because of such doings. The argument that works of art are\ncultural objects, not physical objects, because the former have\nproperties the latter don\u2019t, is thus rejected by Beardsley.\n",
