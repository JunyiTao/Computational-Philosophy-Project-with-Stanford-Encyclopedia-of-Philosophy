    "main_text": "Denying obligations to oneself\n3. Denying obligations to oneself\n\nLet\u2019s start with Singer\u2019s view, which is that, as shown by\nthe paradox, there can be no obligations to oneself. There may be\nself-regarding obligations owed to other people; there may be decisive\nreasons to be prudent. But no one ever literally owes anything to\noneself, morally speaking. On the extreme version of this view, no one\neven has a moral reason to promote their own interests as such (see,\ne.g., Finlay 2007).\n\nSinger gets points for dispensing with the paradox. He doesn\u2019t\nposit duties to self, and he has a principled reason for not doing so:\ngiven the possibility of self-release, a duty to oneself would not be\nbinding \u2013 which means it would lack the core property of any\nduty that deserves the name.\n\nThe challenge for Singer\u2019s view is that it is revisionary,\nobliterating half of the classic distinction between duties to self\nand duties to others \u2013 a distinction that \u201cseems well\nembedded both in traditional moral philosophy and in ordinary moral\nthinking\u201d (Singer 1958, 202).\n\nPerhaps it is all right for Singer to dispute traditional wisdom. It\nwould not be the first time a tradition got something wrong. Besides,\nas we have noted, there is an equally distinguished tradition of\nskepticism about obligations to oneself. Even Kant, the chief\ndefender of duties to self, has wary moments (see \u00a72, 4).\nDeference to the past isn\u2019t decisive here.\n\nWhat about ordinary thought? If duties to self are really\n\u201cembedded\u201d in common sense, that is certainly some reason\nto reject Singer\u2019s argument, or at least to look for ways\nout.\n\nSinger himself suggests that we should not take our ordinary moral\ndiscourse too seriously. When we talk of duties to oneself, our\nlanguage \u201cmust be metaphorical\u201d (1958, 203). He\nexplains:\n\nTo say that someone has a duty to (or owes it to) himself to do\nsomething is an emphatic way of asserting that he has a right to do it\n\u2013 that there are no moral considerations against it \u2013 and\nthat it would be foolish or imprudent for him not to. (1958, 203)\n\n\nSimilarly, Singer thinks, when you \u201cpromise yourself\u201d to\ndo something, you must really be expressing your resolve to do it (see\nalso Haase 2014, 364; Hills 2003, 131\u201333).\n\nThere are three questions we might ask about Singer\u2019s\ninterpretation of ordinary talk. First, Anita Allen questions why we\nshouldn\u2019t take people literally in these contexts:\n\nFigures of speech abound in language. But in the case of statements\nabout duties to oneself, why suppose we do not mean exactly what we\nsay? A moral theory should explain rather than discount inconvenient\nmoral discourse (2013, 859)\n\n\nSecond, and related, we could ask if Singer\u2019s position does\njustice to the thoughts behind the talk. Consider a few basic\nquestions: is it morally all right to risk dire injuries to oneself\nfor a cheap thrill? To debase oneself for a few bucks? To accept\nhumiliation from peers for the sake of fitting in? One might well say\nno, even if these actions are certain to harm nobody but\noneself. This is more than a linguistic habit that philosophers should\nbe able to explain. These are considerable \u2013 though still\ncontestable \u2013 moral intuitions, and the appeal to metaphors may\nnot be enough to overturn them.\n\nFinally, Singer\u2019s view seems to suggest that we should be happy\nto talk, at least metaphorically, of rights against oneself \u2013\nwhich, in fact, we are not. For Singer, \u201cpromises to\noneself\u201d are just statements of resolve, and \u201cduties to\noneself\u201d are exaggerated \u2018oughts\u2019. Presumably,\n\u201crights against oneself\u201d would be understood\nmetaphorically, as well. And yet, no one is willing to talk of rights\nagainst oneself. Why? The answer cannot just be that these rights are\n\u201csurely nonsense\u201d (Singer 1958, 202). For Singer, duties\nto oneself by definition entail rights against oneself, so\nthe duties should be at least as nonsensical. This is a fact\nabout ordinary talk that Singer seems unable to account for.\n\nStepping back from Singer for a moment, there does seem to be\nsomething distinctive about the realm of rights, as opposed to other\nparts of morality. Rights are waived by consent and created by\ncontracts. Rights imply authority. If you rightfully own a bicycle,\nthen when it comes to who gets to ride it, you are the boss.\n(This is especially clear on \u201cstanding theories.\u201d See\n\u00a71 above.)\n\nWe now turn to the most popular response to the paradox, which is to\nrescue obligations to oneself by airlifting them out of the realm of\nrights. We can owe things to ourselves precisely because\nowing does not imply rights or the authority to waive. Even if\nself-release is impossible, there could still be unwaivable\nobligations to oneself.\n",
