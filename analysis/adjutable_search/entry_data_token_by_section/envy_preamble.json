    "main_text": "\n\nEnvy is a complex and puzzling emotion. It is, notoriously, one of the\nseven deadly sins in the Catholic tradition. It is very commonly\ncharged with being (either typically or universally) unreasonable,\nirrational, imprudent, vicious, or wrong to feel. With very few\nexceptions, the ample philosophical literature defending the\nrationality and evaluative importance of emotions explicitly excludes\nenvy and a few other nasty emotions as irredeemable. Indeed, some\nauthors who are prepared to defend even jealousy insist that envy is\nbeyond the pale. Yet there is considerable controversy over what\nprecisely envy is, and the cogency of various specific criticisms of\nenvy depends on what view of that subject is adopted. \n\nIn addition to its centrality to discussions in the philosophy of\nemotions, envy has sparked controversies in political philosophy.\nPerhaps best known among these is the claim that egalitarian views of\njustice are motivated by envy. It also receives substantial treatment\nfrom John Rawls, who takes pains to argue that envy does not pose a\nthreat to his theory of justice. Each of these topics receives some\ntreatment below.\n",
