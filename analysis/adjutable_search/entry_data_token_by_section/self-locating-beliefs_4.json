    "main_text": "Arguments and Examples || Arguments from difference\n2.3 Arguments from difference\n\nAnother major thread of argument for a theoretically distinctive\ncategory of self-locating belief maintains that there are important\ndoxastic similarities and differences between agents that are\ndifficult to characterize without that distinctive category.\nIntroducing such a category provides the resources to characterize\nthose similarities and differences in a theoretically helpful way. We\nwill focus on difference-based arguments in this subsection, then take\nup similarities in the next.\n\nIn the messy shopper example, there\u2019s an important doxastic\ndifference between Perry before his a-ha moment and Perry\nafter his a-ha moment. But that difference isn\u2019t (Perry\nargues) a difference in which descriptive or de re\npropositions Perry believes. So we need some extra theoretical\nresources, beyond states of believing P for\ntraditional propositions P, to characterize the doxastic\nchange Perry undergoes in his a-ha moment.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that the messy shopper example has both an\nignorance thread and a difference thread. Typically, where\nthere\u2019s an argument from ignorance, there\u2019s an argument\nfrom difference\u2014the pre- and post-discovery stages in a case of\nresolved ignorance will be importantly doxastically\ndifferent. And even when the ignorance isn\u2019t resolved, there\nwill be in the background a relevant doxastic difference between the\nsubject in the case as described and the subject as they would be if\nthe ignorance were resolved.\n\nYet where there\u2019s an argument from difference, there need not be\nan argument from ignorance. We can illustrate this with another famous\nexample from Perry of two hikers, one of whom is attacked by a bear\n(Perry 1977: 23). Let\u2019s call the hikers John and David, and\nlet\u2019s suppose that it\u2019s John who is attacked while David\nlooks on.\n\nJohn and David both believe that John is being attacked by a\nbear. But they display, Perry notes, very different behavior:\nJohn curls up into a ball; David runs for help. It\u2019s very\nplausible to attribute this difference in behavior to a doxastic\ndifference between them. (A difference that makes it appropriate, for\nexample, to say that John, but not David, believes that he\nhimself is being attacked by a bear.) But the doxastic difference\nisn\u2019t a difference in traditional propositions\nbelieved\u2014certainly it isn\u2019t a difference in\npossible-worlds propositions believed, or in descriptive or de\nre structured propositions believed. John and David are on\nexactly the same page about the relevant aspects of the\nworld\u2014it\u2019s a world in which John is being attacked by a\nbear, and David isn\u2019t. They are on exactly the same page about\nwhich relevant descriptive and de re structured propositions\nare true\u2014it\u2019s true that the prominent advocate of\nself-locating belief from Stanford is being attacked by a bear, while\nthe prominent advocate of self-locating belief from Princeton is not,\nthat John is being attacked and David is not, etc.\n\nHere then is the general form of a difference argument centered around\nsome case, which we\u2019ll call \u2018CASE\u2019:\n\nThere is an important doxastic difference between A and\nB in CASE.\nIn CASE, A and B are alike with respect to all\nof the potentially relevant states of believing P\nfor traditional propositions P.\nSo, there are some important doxastic states that are not states\nof believing P for traditional propositions\nP, such that differences in those kinds of states can explain\nthe doxastic difference between A and B in\nCASE.\n\n\nWhile ignorance arguments often need to become quite odd and\nscience-fictional, difference arguments don\u2019t. Here is why: The\nmost obvious strategy for responding to both sorts of arguments is to\nidentify some piece of Simple Picture-friendly information that would\nresolve the ignorance, or mark the doxastic difference. In ignorance\ncases, this strategy can initially look very promising. If Lingens\nthinks of himself as the unique bearded man in a plaid shirt reading a\nbiography of Rudolph Lingens, then learning the Simple\nPicture-friendly information that the bearded man in a plaid shirt\nreading a biography of Rudolph Lingens is in the Stanford library will\nresolve his ignorance. So to keep Simple Picture-friendly information\nfrom resolving Lingens\u2019 ignorance, we need to make sure Lingens\ndoesn\u2019t think that he\u2019s the unique bearded man in a plaid\nshirt reading a biography of Rudolph Lingens. He needs to think\nthat\u2014or at least, leave open the possibility\nthat\u2014there\u2019s another bearded man in a plaid shirt reading\na biography of Lingens somewhere. More generally, there needs to be\nno unique Simple Picture-friendly description of himself\navailable to Lingens, because any such description would allow some\nSimple Picture-friendly information to resolve his ignorance.\nSimilarly for de re belief\u2014the subjects of ignorance\ncases mustn\u2019t be in a position to uniquely identify themselves\nde re.\n\nThat\u2019s why ignorance argument cases wind up involving things\nlike mirror-image universes with qualitatively indistinguishable\n\u201csides\u201d, pairs of amnesiacs undergoing identical courses\nof subjective experience, pairs of gods with unusual perspectives on\nthe world, and so on.\n\nThose are peculiar, highly science-fictional cases. In more ordinary\ncases, believers have access to a description that they take to apply\nuniquely to themselves, even if it\u2019s quite complex and difficult\nto state concisely. To preserve the case, and make sure that\nno Simple Picture-friendly information can help, the case\nneeds to get very weird. And it\u2019s natural to worry about whether\nintuitions about such cases are good bases for theory choice.\n\nOf course advocates for a special category of self-locating-belief\nwill say that this response misses the point. The de re\nproposition about Lingens, or the descriptive proposition about the\nunique bearded, plaid-shirt-wearing biography reader, can only help\nresolve Lingens\u2019 ignorance if we assume Lingens\u2019\nself-locating belief that he himself is Lingens, or that\nhe himself is the unique F. And there is something to\nthis. But now the dialectical ground has shifted. Rather than offering\nan example about which we have clear\u2014and clearly Simple\nPicture-unfriendly\u2014intuitions, the advocate for a special\ncategory of self-locating belief simply insists on their theory. The\nforce of the argument is diminished.\n\nFor advocates of self-locating belief, difference arguments have the\nadvantage of working with cases that aren\u2019t so strange and\nscience-fictional. Cases in which two subjects have all the same\nSimple Picture-friendly beliefs, yet respond very differently to their\nenvironments, needn\u2019t be especially peculiar\u2014their only\npeculiarity is in the unlikely degree of shared belief. And cases in\nwhich subjects have all the same relevant Simple\nPicture-friendly beliefs, so that differences in subjects\u2019\nSimple Picture-friendly beliefs don\u2019t explain the differences in\nhow they respond to their environments, are not peculiar at all. They\nare actual, and common. (Other examples from the literature include\nPerry\u2019s case of the lost hiker [1979: 4] and Kaplan\u2019s\nburning pants case [1989: 537], which also features prominently in\nChierchia 1989: 2\u20133.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth pausing on Perry\u2019s case of a professor waiting\nfor a faculty meeting to start, as this case extends the issue about\nself-location to temporal self-location:\n\n\na professor, who desires to attend the department meeting on time, and\nbelieves correctly that it begins at noon, sits motionless in his\noffice at that time. Suddenly he begins to move. What explains his\naction? A change in belief. He believed all along that the department\nmeeting starts at noon; he came to believe, as he would have put it,\nthat it starts now. (Perry 1979: 4)\n\n\nThis is a temporal difference case: there\u2019s an important\ndoxastic difference between the professor when he\u2019s sitting\nmotionless in his office, thinking to himself \u201cthe meeting\nbegins at noon\u201d, and the professor when he starts to move,\nthinking to himself, \u201cthe meeting begins now\u201d. But the\ndifference isn\u2019t in traditional propositions believed\u2014the\nprofessor believes, both before and after he begins to move, that the\nmeeting begins at noon, at the time when the clock strikes twelve\ntimes, etc. Characterizing the difference requires resources beyond\nthose of the Simple Picture.\n",
