    "main_text": "Conception || Conception and Self-Knowledge\n2.2 Conception and Self-Knowledge\n\n\nReid affirms human beings know what are the intentional contents of\ntheir thoughts. If I think about a tree, then I am (defeasibly)\njustified that I am thinking about a tree. But the Way of Ideas\njeopardizes Reid's commitment to the obviousness of our introspective\nability to identify what we are thinking about. Like the more familiar\nveil of perception created by the representational role of\nideas (see 3.1 The Way of Ideas and Representational\nTheories of Perception ), there is also a veil\nof conception. The seeds of Reid's argument are in Hume's\ncandid remark that, given the Way of Ideas, mental events \u201cseem\nentirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never\ncan observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never\nconnected. ... [T]he necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no\nidea of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely\nwithout any meaning\u201d (Enquiry 7.2.6, 74;\nsee Treatise 1.2.6.8, 67). Hume's causal explanation of\nreverberating impacts on impressions in the mind does not explain the\ncontent of our thoughts. Hume describes his theory of thought as\ncorpuscular because impressions are atomic and separable mental states\nwithout any determinate intentional link to anything else. Note that\nHume appears to be led to this position by way of his attempt to\nrepurpose Newtonian mechanics, as it applies to bodies, to formulate a\nscience of the mind.\n\n \nTroubled by the statement from Hume, Reid constructs a reductio\nargument against Hume's theory of thought that plays upon the\nimplications just noted. Reid presents this argument about the\nintentionality of thought through an analogy about the meaning of\nlanguage, specifically, about someone who is blind to the meaning of\nthe language in a book. Suppose I see unfamiliar ink marks on paper. I\nneither know what they mean nor even that they are meaningful to\nanyone. The meanings of these words are not intrinsic to the\nrepresentations of the words, whether those representations are\non paper or are sound waves, just like the intentional content of\nideas is not intrinsic to the ideas themselves. Reid writes:\nSuppose that ideas represent things like symbols; in this\nway, words and writing are known to express everything. Let the\nintellect, therefore, be instructed by ideas ... like a written or\nprinted book, teaching us many things that are external, that have\npassed away, and that will come to be. This view does not solve the\nproblem; for who will interpret this book for us? If you show a book\nto a savage who has never heard of the use of letters, he will not\nknow the letters are symbols, much less what they signify. If you\naddress someone in a foreign language, perhaps your words are symbols\nas far as you are concerned, but they mean nothing to\nhim. (Philosophical Orations, Reid 1937, 35 & Reid 1989,\n62)\n\n\nUninterpreted impressions are syntactic and purportedly\nrepresentational. But \u201cSymbols without interpretation have no\nvalue\u201d (Philosophical Orations, Reid 1937, 35 and Reid\n1989, 62). The resulting veil of conception implies that my\nimpressions risk having no meaning for me. As a result, I do not know\nthe contents of my own thoughts. Since this is absurd, Reid rejects\nthe Way of Ideas' premise that leads to it. This fascinating argument\nhas been explored and its affinities with John Searle's Chinese Room\nargument have been noted (Haldane 1989, 1993 & Nichols 2007,\nch. 2), but it merits further development.\n\n\nReid's reductio of the Way of Ideas' theory of thought is intended to\nbuttress Reid's claims that conceiving is irreducibly intentional and\nthat, because of this, we have knowledge of the contents of our\nthoughts. Hume refrains from this claim in part because he sees no\nplausible metaphysics to support it. That is, if intentionality is\nendemic to thought, then the mind must not be what we think it\nis\u2014a part of nature whose ideas operate on impact principles\nfamiliar from Newtonian mechanics. Reid is aware of this problem and\nprepares to bite the bullet. He describes our ability to apprehend one\nthing and not another as being \u201ca natural kind of magic\u201d\n(IHM 5.3, 59\u201360). In an effort to explicate this mysterious conceptual\nability, Reid examines theories of thought of Aristotle and medieval\nphilosophers. These theories posit substantial forms that conjoin\nthoughts to their intentional objects (Philosophical\nOrations, Reid 1937, 38 and Reid 1989, 66). Yet Reid judges them\nharshly and finds their ontology \u201cincomprehensible\u201d (EIP\n2.8, 114). He withholds further speculation about the metaphysics that\nmust undergird the claim that intentionality is primitive. This move\nillustrates a feature of Reid's philosophical method: common sense and\nknowledge are conceptually and explanatorily prior to metaphysical\ncommitments.\n",
