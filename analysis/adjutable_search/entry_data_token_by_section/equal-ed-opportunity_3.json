A Brief History of Equality of Educational Opportunity in the United States\n\nGiven the importance of education to individuals and to society, it is\nclear that education cannot be distributed by the market: it needs to\nbe available to all children, even children whose parents would be too\npoor or too indifferent to pay for it. Furthermore, if education is to\nplay a role in equipping young people to participate in the labor\nmarket, to participate in democratic governance, and more generally to\nlead flourishing lives, then its content cannot be arbitrary but\nrather must be tailored to meet these desired outcomes. We address\nconsiderations of education\u2019s content in subsequent sections,\nturning first to how equality of opportunity has been interpreted in\nthe U.S., where we can see some of the implications of a truncated\nunderstanding of equality of opportunity in stark form.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of\nEducation (1954) decision, in finding racially segregated public\nschools unconstitutional, declared that the opportunity for an\neducation, when provided for by the state, is a \u201cright which\nmust be available to all on equal terms\u201d. But de facto\nracial segregation persists in the U.S. and is coupled today with\never-growing class-based segregation (Reardon & Bischoff 2011).\nBlack students are far more likely to attend high-poverty schools than\ntheir white peers (see school poverty, in the National Equity Atlas,\n Other Internet Resources).\n The resulting, compounded educational disadvantages that poor,\nminority children face in the U.S. are significant. As research\ncontinues to document, the racial/ethnic achievement gap is persistent\nand large in the U.S. and has lasting labor market effects, whereby\nthe achievement gap has been found to explain a significant part of\nracial/ethnic income disparities (Reardon, Robinson-Cimpian, &\nWeathers 2015; Reardon 2021 in Other Internet Resources).\n\nEfforts to combat de facto segregation have been limited by\nU.S. jurisprudence since the Brown decision. Although the\nSupreme Court previously allowed plans to integrate schools within a\nparticular school district (see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBoard of Education, 1970), in Milliken v. Bradley (1974)\nthe Court struck down an inter-district busing plan that moved\nstudents across district lines to desegregate the Detroit city and\nsurrounding suburban schools. This limitation on legal remedies for\nde facto segregation has significantly hampered integration\nefforts given that most school districts in the U.S. are not racially\ndiverse. More recently, the U.S. Supreme Court further curtailed\nintegration efforts within the small number of districts that are\nracially diverse. In its Parents Involved in Community Schools v.\nSeattle School District decision (2006), the Court prohibited\ndistricts from explicitly using individual students\u2019 race as a\nfactor in school assignment plans, thereby condoning only race-neutral\nintegration plans in what many regarded as the Court\u2019s final\nretreat from redressing de facto segregation (e.g., Rebell\n2009; Ryan 2007).\n\nThe persistence of race and class-based segregation in the U.S. and\nthe educational disadvantages that follow are rooted in the U.S.\nsystem of geographically defined school districts, whereby schools are\nlargely funded by local property taxes that differ substantially\nbetween communities based on property values. This patchwork system\ncompounds the educational disadvantages that follow from residential\nsegregation. The 50 states in the United States differ dramatically in\nthe level of per pupil educational funding that they provide; indeed\nsome of these interstate disparities are greater than the intra-state\ninequalities that have received greater attention (Liu 2006). The\nsystem for funding schools and the residential segregation it\nexacerbates\u2014itself the product of decades of laws and conscious\npolicies to keep the races separate\u2014has produced and continues\nto yield funding inequalities that disproportionately affect poor\nAmericans of color. The segregation of resources, with greater\nresources flowing to children from families in the upper quintiles of\nsociety, makes it highly unlikely that children from the lower\nquintiles can have an equal chance of achieving success. This is\nevident in research documenting the growing achievement gap between\nhigh and low-income students, which is now 30\u201340% greater among\nchildren born in 2001 than those born twenty-five years before\n(Reardon 2011: 91; Reardon 2021 in Other Internet Resources).\n\nGiven the judicial retreat from remedying de facto\nsegregation, many advocates have shifted their attention to the school\nfinance system. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in this arena\nwas an initial setback to efforts to advance educational equality via\nfederal school finance litigation. In this case, San Antonio\nIndependent School District v. Rodriguez (1973), the Court found\nthat there is no federal right to education, and that funding\ninequalities among school districts due to variations in property tax\nrevenue are not unconstitutional. This decision further entrenched the\neducational inequalities that follow from the geographic happenstance\nof a child\u2019s home. In contrast to the U.S., many other countries\ndo not finance their schools through local property taxes (e.g.,\nFinland funds its schools at the national level based on the number of\nstudents they educate, and it provides more funding to schools that\neducate more students who are immigrants or whose parents are\nunemployed or uneducated; Sahlberg 2011). Many other societies\ndistribute educational resources in a more centralized way than does\nthe United States, which leaves educational funding, and even\neducational standards, to a large extent in local hands (for a recent\nvolume on the idea of a federal right to education in the U.S., see\nRobinson 2019).\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court did, however, leave an opening for state courts\nto act, and so legal advocates have adopted a state-by-state approach\nin the decades since Rodriguez. As this litigation has\nunfolded in almost every U.S. state, a policy debate with\nphilosophical underpinnings has emerged around the question: Should\neducational resources be distributed on an equal basis (an equity\nmodel), or according to a sufficiency threshold (adequacy model)?\nState constitutions differ as to the basis they suggest for the\nstate\u2019s interest in funding education.\n\nIn the legal and political sphere, the adequacy approach has been more\nsuccessful in school finance litigation at the state level. But the\nphilosophical elaboration of equity and adequacy as competing ideals\nis somewhat distinct from how they are used in legal battles and\npolitical discourse. As we describe below, some theorists challenge\nthe cogency of the sharp distinction often made between these two ways\nof justifying the distribution of educational resources.\n",
