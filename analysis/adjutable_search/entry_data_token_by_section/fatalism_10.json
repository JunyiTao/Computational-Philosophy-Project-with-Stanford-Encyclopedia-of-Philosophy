We would also, presumably, need to amend\npresupposition 5, so that it was not the lack of a necessary condition\nfor an act which was problematical, but the existence of a condition\nwhich was sufficient for the non-performance of the act.\n\nIs that the only objection? Must we accept the Aristotelian solution\nif we wish to escape the fatalistic conclusion?\n",
