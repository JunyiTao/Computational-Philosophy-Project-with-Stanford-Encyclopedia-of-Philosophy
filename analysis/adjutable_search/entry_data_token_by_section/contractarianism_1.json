    "main_text": "The Metaphor of Contract\n2. The Metaphor of Contract\n\nThe metaphor of the social contract requires some interpretation in\norder to apply it to the situation of morality or politics. The\ninterpretation can be specified by determining answers to three\nquestions. First, what is the agreement on? Possible answers include\nthe principles of justice (Rousseau, Rawls), the design of the basic\nsocial institutions (Rawls), the commitment to give up to a sovereign\ngovernment (some or all of) one\u2019s rights (Hobbes, Locke), the adoption\nof a disposition to be (conventionally) moral (Gauthier, Hampton). The\nsecond question is how the agreement is to be thought of: as a\nhypothetical agreement? An actual historical agreement? An implicit\nhistorical situation? The third question is whether the contract\ndevice is to be used as justification or explanation. As discussed\nabove, normative contractarianism uses the contract device primarily\nas justification, but it may be that Hobbes and Locke thought that\nthere was an explanatory element to the contract device. As will be\ndiscussed below (Subversive Contractarianism), an important\ncontemporary contractarianism uses an implicit contract to explain the\norigin of oppression. \n",
