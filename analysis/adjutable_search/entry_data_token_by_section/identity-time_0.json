    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAs a number of philosophers have remarked, one of the many puzzles\nabout identity, given its apparent simplicity, is why it proves so\npuzzling. Indeed, one pervasive sentiment is that identity cannot pose\nany philosophical problems. Anything that looks like a problem about\nidentity must really be a problem about something else. David Lewis\ngives striking expression to this sentiment when he says:\n\nMore important, we should not suppose that we have here any problem\nabout identity. We never have. Identity is utterly simple and\nunproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever\nidentical to anything except itself. There is never any problem about\nwhat makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be.\n(Lewis 1986, 192\u2013193)\n\n\nDespite that, problems about identity appear to play a central role in\na large number of philosophical issues whose discussion dates back to\nthe ancient world. One of the most venerable concerns identity and\nchange. Things change, but remain the same. The same poker is at one\ntime hot, another time cold. How can something be both identical and\ndifferent from one time to another? At first sight this problem\nevaporates once we draw the time honored distinction between numerical\nand qualitative identity. To say that a and b are\nqualitatively identical is to say that a exactly resembles\nb. To say that a and b are numerically\nidentical is, at least, to say a and b are one thing\nand not two. Whether a and b can have all\ntheir qualities in common without being numerically identical is\ncontroversial. Nevertheless, it seems that a and b\ncan be numerically identical without being qualitatively identical by\nhaving different qualities at different times.\n\nSome find problematic the very same thing having different properties\nat different times (see the problem of temporary intrinsics discussed\nbelow). Setting that general problem aside, there are special cases of\nit that generate some of the most intractable issues about identity.\nOne results from persisting things putatively having different parts\nat different times. Consider an object capable of changing its parts,\nsuch as a cup at a time when its handle is still attached. At that\ntime the cup appears to consist of the following two parts: a smaller\none, its handle, together with a larger one consisting of the rest of\nthe cup. Call the larger of these parts the truncated cup. The cup,\notherwise unscathed, proceeds to lose its handle. At the earlier time,\nwith its handle still intact, the cup is surely distinct from the\ntruncated cup. Later, after the removal of the cup's handle, the cup\nspatially coincides with the truncated cup. Each object is, at the\nlater time, composed from exactly the same atoms. As one philosopher\nhas put it about a different example, at the later time the cup and\nthe truncated cup are as alike as one pea in a pod (Denis Robinson, in\nconversation). Should we say that the cup and truncated cup are\nearlier distinct, but later identical? The problem is that saying so\narguably conflicts with a fundamental principle governing identity\ncalled Leibniz's Law.\n\nIdentity looms large in Leibniz's philosophy. He is responsible for\narticulating two principles that, he claims, are constitutive of\nidentity. The first, more controversial, of these, called the identity\nof indiscernibles, says that qualitative indiscernibility implies\nidentity. The second, often referred to as Leibniz's Law or the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals, says that identity implies qualitative\nindiscernibility. According to Leibniz's Law, if a is\nidentical with b, every quality of a will be a\nquality of b. (See the entry on\n identity of indiscernibles.)\n\nHere are two ways in which, it seems, saying that the cup is earlier\ndistinct from, but later identical with, the truncated cup conflicts\nwith Leibniz's Law. Ostensibly one of the cup's later properties is\nhaving earlier had a handle. That is the property the truncated cup\nnever has. So, identifying the later cup and truncated cup appears to\nviolate Leibniz's Law. There is, at least, one property, having\nformerly had a handle, that the cup and truncated cup never have in\ncommon.\n\nHere is a second way in which the claim that the cup and truncated cup\nare sometimes, but not always, identical appears to violate Leibniz's\nLaw. Let us bestow a name on the cup. Call it \u2018Cup\u2019. Let\nus also call the truncated cup \u2018Tcup\u2019. We are envisaging\nthat Cup is sometimes, but not always, identical with Tcup. Leibniz's\nLaw tells us that Cup and Tcup share all their properties at any time\nthey are identical. Some properties are commonly referred to as modal\nproperties. A modal property is the property of possibly or\nnecessarily having some further property. Modal properties include\nsuch properties as being possibly red, necessarily extended, possibly\ntaller than a giraffe, or necessarily cup shaped. Arguably one of\nCup's modal properties is the property of being necessarily identical\nwith Cup. Suppose Cup and Tcup are at some time identical. In that\ncase, by Leibniz's Law, Tcup will, at some time, share with Cup the\nmodal property of being necessarily identical with Cup. So, if Cup is\never identical with Tcup, then Tcup has the modal property of being\nnecessarily identical with Cup. But if Tcup is necessarily identical\nwith Cup, there can be no time when Tcup is distinct from Cup.\n\nLet us say that the identity of a with b is\ntemporary if a is sometimes, but not always, identical with\nb. Later we shall look at other types of puzzle cases that\nprovide some motivation for countenancing temporary identity. Despite\nthe existence of such cases the majority of philosophers are\nreluctant, principally because of the putative conflict with Leibniz's\nLaw, to allow temporary identity. Instead, to deal with puzzles about\nidentity through time a wide range of alternatives have been proposed.\nThese include: maintaining that Cup is later constituted by Tcup\n(where constitution does not imply identity); denying that Tcup is\nearlier a proper part of Cup; maintaining that Cup and Tcup are never\nidentical, but only share a later temporal part in common; holding\nthat the identity between the earlier Tcup and later Cup is not\nliteral, but only loose and popular.\n\nBy synchronic identity we mean an identity holding at a single time.\nBy diachronic identity we mean an identity holding between something\nexisting at one time and something existing at another. One question\nis whether synchronic and diachronic identity are different kinds of\nidentity. Some philosophers are willing to countenance different kinds\nof identity. Others are reluctant to do so. One philosopher who is\nwilling to postulate a multiplicity of different kinds of identity is\nPeter Geach. Geach, among others, has addressed puzzles about both\nsynchronic and diachronic identity by denying that there is a single\nabsolute relation of identity rather than a host of relative identity\nrelations. On this view we cannot simply say that a is\nidentical with b. Instead there must be a concept of a kind\nof thing, a so called sortal concept, that serves to answer the\nquestion: a is the same what as b? This is\nso, according to the champions of relative identity, because the\nfollowing can happen: a and b both fall under the\nsortal concepts F and G, a is the same\nF as b, but a is not the same G as\nb (Geach 1967, and see the entry on\n relative identity).\n\nConsider the case of Cup and Tcup. Is Cup at the later time\nt\u2032 identical with Tcup? Is Tcup at t\u2032\nidentical with Tcup at t? A relative identity theorist would\ndeny that these questions have answers. For such a theorist to have an\nanswerable question we would need to replace, for example, the first\nwith: At t\u2032 is Cup the same cup as Tcup?\n\nHow could insisting on the relativity of the answer to an identity\nquestion to a kind help with the diachronic identity puzzle posed by\nCup and Tcup? Here is one way that it could. Suppose that nothing is a\ncup when it is a proper part of a cup. Then Tcup fails to qualify as a\ncup at t when it is a proper part of Cup. In that case a relative\nidentity theorist can say the following. At the later time\nt\u2032 Cup is the same cup as Tcup. Since Tcup is not a cup\nat the earlier time t, neither Cup not Tcup at\nt\u2032 is the same cup as Tcup at t. Moreover, for\nany kind K, Cup is not the same K as Tcup at\nt. Identifying Cup with Tcup as the same cup at\nt\u2032 places us under no constraint to identify Cup with\none of its proper parts, Tcup, at t.\n\nSome of those who reject relative identity nevertheless accept that\na cannot be identical with b, unless there is a more\nspecific answer to the question whether a is the same\nthing as b. Many philosophers distinguish between\ntwo kinds of concepts which are applicable to whatever can persist\nthrough time. One kind is illustrated by the concepts of gold (as\nopposed to a quantity or piece of gold), snow, or rain. In the case of\nany such concept F, there is no answer to the question: how\nmany Fs are there? In contrast, in the case of other concepts\nsuch as the concept of a horse, a tall person, an artwork, or a statue\nthere is an answer to the question: how many Fs are there?\nFor example, though we may not know it, there is an answer to the\nquestion: how many statues are there? Concepts of this last kind are\noften referred to as sortal concepts. Those who take the view that the\nquestion whether a is the same as b is illegitimate,\nunless it is construed as elliptical for the question whether\na is the same thing of such and such a kind as b\ntypically also hold the following views. We should distinguish between\ntwo types of sortal concepts: phase and substance sortals. A phase\nsortal such as child, utensil or prize is a concept that something can\ncease to fall under without ceasing to exist. If, in contrast,\nsomething falls under a substance sortal, it must always do so. If\na at some time t is the same as b at the\nsame, or a different time t\u2032, it must, say advocates of\nthe view in question, be that, for some sortal S, a\nat t is the same S as b at\nt\u2032. For example, if John's favorite artwork at\nt is identical with Sally's most valuable possession at\nt\u2032, there must be a substance sortal, the concept of a\nstatue as it may be, under which John's favorite artwork at\nt, and Sally's most valuable possession at t\u2032\nboth fall. Moreover, a substance sortal is said to go together with a\ncriterion of identity where a criterion of identity associated with\nsubstance sortal S is, inter alia, a criterion for some\nearlier S being the same S as some later\nS.\n\nFinally, there are a group of issues that fall under the heading of\nthe dispensability of identity. According to one tradition that goes\nback, at least, to Wittgenstein's Tractatus, we can\ntheoretically dispense with identity talk without loss of information.\nSome, but by no means all, who take this view, do so because they hold\nthat the predicate \u2018is identical with\u2019 corresponds to no\ngenuine property. Issues about the dispensability of identity engage\nwith issues about identity across time in the following way. This\nsection opened with a quote from David Lewis claiming that there is\nnever any philosophical problem about identity. The case of Cup and\nTcup raises what is ostensibly a problem about identity across time.\nThat problem only arises, it seems, because the later Cup is\nputatively identical with the earlier Tcup. If the problem is not, in\npart, about that putative identity holding, what is it about?\n\nAccording to a four dimensionalist like David Lewis a table is\nextended through the time of its life, and constituted from temporal\nparts which are themselves short lived tables. As such a four\ndimensionalist like Lewis would not hesitate to give the following\nanswer to the above question. The problem is, in part, a problem about\nwhether a cup-like object that exists only at t\u2032 is\nsuitably related to a cup-like object, itself a proper part of a\nlarger cup-like object, that exists only at t so that both\ncup-like objects are temporal stages or parts of a four-dimensionally\nextended cup.\n\nIf we are not prepared to endorse four dimensionalism, it remains to\nbe seen how the putative problem about Cup and Tcup's identity through\ntime can be reformulated so that it is no longer a problem about\nidentity through time.\n",
