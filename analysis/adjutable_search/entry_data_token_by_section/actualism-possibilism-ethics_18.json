    "main_text": "Non-Primary Obligations\n5. Non-Primary Obligations\n\nThe discussion up until this point has centered around making sense of\nthe general notion that an agent ought to do the (non-supererogatory)\nbest that she is able to do. But some theories hold that an\nagent\u2019s moral life is more complex than this because an\nagent\u2019s ability to do less than the (non-supererogatory) best is\nalso obligatory is some non-primary sense. This approach is motivated\nin part by the thought that some wrong actions are better than others.\nMichael McKinsey (1979: 391\u2013392) develops this approach,\ndefending a view with multiple levels of obligation. His view may be\nformulated as follows:\n\n\n\nLevels of Obligation (LO): \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is a life\nsequence from t for x. Every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) has a rank\n\\(n (n \\ge 1)\\) relative to every other life-sequence from t\nfor x, where n is a positive integer. If \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\)\nis among the optimum life sequences from t for x, then\nthe rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 1\\); if \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is among the second\nbest such sequences, then the rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 2\\); and so on.\nx ought\\(_n\\) at t to do \\(A_i\\) iff:\n\n \\(A_i\\) is contained in every\n\\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) of rank n.\n For every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) which has a\nrank m higher than n (i.e., where \\(m \\lt n)\\), there is\nan \\(A_j\\) such that \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) contains \\(A_j\\) and x will\nnot do \\(A_j\\).\n \n\n\nWhile McKinsey\u2019s formulation of (LO) is rather complicated, the\nbasic idea is quite simple. According to (LO), an agent\nS\u2019s primary obligation is identical to the obligation\nthat possibilists believe S has. Additionally, for every\nmaximal act-set M (or a life) that, at t, S can\nperform, if M is not identical to the best maximal act-set\nthat, at t, S can perform, but is better than the\nmaximal act-set that S will in fact perform, then at t\nS has a moral obligation to perform M. To illustrate,\nconsider this case:\n\n The Buttons: At t Ben can both\npress and refrain from pressing any of the three buttons in front of\nhim, and doing any of these things comes at little to no cost to Ben.\nPressing no button results in no deaths, pressing the first button\nresults in one death, pressing the second button results in two\ndeaths, and pressing the third button results in three deaths. Suppose\nthat Ben presses the third button, resulting in three deaths.\n\n\n(LO)\n implies that there are three levels of obligations that Ben fails to\nfulfill: his primary obligation to refrain from pressing any button,\nhis secondary obligation to press the first button, and his tertiary\nobligation to press the second button. If Ben were to instead press\nthe second button, then Ben would have failed to fulfill only two\nobligations, viz. the primary obligation to refrain from pressing a\nbutton, and the secondary obligation to press the first button. \n\nMcKinsey\u2019s\n (LO)\n is, in one sense, in agreement with possibilism because an\nagent\u2019s primary obligation is identical to a possibilist\nobligation. Moreover, even though (LO) can generate jointly\nunfulfillable obligations, (LO) agrees with Jackson and\nPargetter\u2019s contextualist actualism that if, in the terminology\nof (LO), an agent fulfills her primary obligation, then it\u2019s not\nthe case that the agent violates any non-primary obligations because\nthe agent simply does not have any non-primary obligations. For\nexample, if Ben refrains from pressing any button, then according to\n(LO) it\u2019s not the case that Ben had a secondary obligation to\npress the first button, and thus no non-primary obligations are\nviolated. McKinsey\u2019s (LO) is, in a sense, also in agreement with\n(non-contextualist) versions of actualism. For example,\nProcrastinate\u2019s obligation according to non-contextualist\nversions of actualism is to \u27e8decline to review the paper &\nnot review the paper\u27e9, and, according to McKinsey, this is\nProcrastinate\u2019s secondary obligation because this act-sequence\nis the second best maximal act-sequence (or a part of the second best\nmaximal act-sequence) that Procrastinate can perform over time. \n\nGoldman (1978: 205\u2013208) holds that there are exactly two orders\nof obligations, one primary and one secondary, and that it is better\nto fulfill one\u2019s secondary obligation rather than to violate\nboth obligations. Primary obligations are governed by Goldman\u2019s\n (G+),\n and secondary obligations are governed by principles such as\nGoldman\u2019s (1976)\n (G*1)\n which, as we have seen in\n section 4,\n does not take into account an agent\u2019s moral character that\ndetermines the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals. For\nexample, in the case of Professor Procrastinate*,\nProcrastinate\u2019s primary obligation is to \u27e8agree to review\nthe paper & review the paper\u27e9 because there is an\nimmediately performable, fully specific simultaneous act-set such\nthat, if performed, would result in \u27e8agreeing & reviewing\nthe paper\u27e9. By contrast, Procrastinate\u2019s secondary\nobligation is to \u27e8decline to review the paper & not review\nthe paper\u27e9 because Procrastinate\u2019s moral character is\nsuch that if Procrastinate were to \u27e8agree to review\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\), then Procrastinate would harm the student by falsely\npromising to review at \\(t_2\\). Procrastinate\u2019s moral character\nis taken into account by her secondary obligation, but not her primary\nobligation. As Goldman (1986: 205) notes, it is sometimes useful to\nreason in a way that holds fixed our actual moral character, and\npositing secondary obligations allows us to reason in this way.\nZimmerman (1986: 70) also subscribes to non-primary obligations and\nmotivates this position in part on the basis of considerations about\ndetachment and conditional obligations.\n",
