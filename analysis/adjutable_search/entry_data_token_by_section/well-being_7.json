    "main_text": "Well-being and Morality || Welfarism\n5.2 Well-being and Virtue\n\nAncient ethics was, in a sense, more concerned with well-being than a\ngood deal of modern ethics, the central question for many ancient\nmoral philosophers being, \u2018Which life is best for one?\u2019.\nThe rationality of egoism\u2014the view that my strongest reason is\nalways to advance my own well-being\u2014was largely assumed. This\nposed a problem. Morality is naturally thought to concern the\ninterests of others. So if egoism is correct, what reason do I have to\nbe moral?\n\nOne obvious strategy to adopt in defence of morality is to claim that\na person\u2019s well-being is in some sense constituted by their\nvirtue, or the exercise of virtue, and this strategy was adopted in\nsubtly different ways by the three greatest ancient philosophers,\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle (for a modern defence of the view, see\nBloomfield (2014)). At one point in his writings, Plato appears to\nallow for the rationality of moral self-sacrifice: the philosophers in\nhis famous \u2018cave\u2019 analogy in the Republic\n(519\u201320) are required by morality to desist from contemplation\nof the sun outside the cave, and to descend once again into the cave\nto govern their fellow citizens. In the voluminous works of Aristotle,\nhowever, there is no recommendation of sacrifice. Aristotle believed\nthat he could defend the virtuous choice as always being in the\ninterest of the individual. Note, however, that he need not be\ndescribed as an egoist in a strong sense\u2014as someone who believes\nthat our only reasons for action are grounded in our own well-being.\nFor him, virtue both tends to advance the good of others, and (at\nleast when acted on) advances our own good. So Aristotle might well\nhave allowed that the well-being of others grounds reasons for me to\nact. But these reasons will never come into conflict with reasons\ngrounded in my own individual well-being.\n\nHis primary argument is the notorious and perfectionist\n\u2018function argument\u2019, according to which the good for some\nbeing is to be identified through attention to its\n\u2018function\u2019 or characteristic activity. The characteristic\nactivity of human beings is to exercise reason, and the good will lie\nin exercising reason well\u2014that is, in accordance with the\nvirtues. This argument, which is stated by Aristotle very briefly and\nrelies on assumptions from elsewhere in his philosophy and indeed that\nof Plato, appears to conflate the two ideas of what is good for a\nperson, and what is morally good. I may agree that a\n\u2018good\u2019 example of humanity will be virtuous, but deny that\nthis person is doing what is best for them. Rather, I may insist,\nreason requires one to advance one\u2019s own good, and this good\nconsists in, for example, pleasure, power, or honour. But much of\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics is taken up with\nportraits of the life of the virtuous and the vicious, which supply\nindependent support for the claim that well-being is constituted by\nvirtue. In particular, it is worth noting the emphasis placed by\nAristotle on the value to a person of \u2018nobility\u2019 (to\nkalon), a quasi-aesthetic value which those sensitive to such\nqualities might not implausibly see as a constituent of well-being of\nmore worth than any other. In this respect, the good of virtue is, in\nthe Kantian sense, \u2018unconditional\u2019. Yet, for Aristotle,\nvirtue or the \u2018good will\u2019 is not only morally good, but\ngood for the individual.\n",
