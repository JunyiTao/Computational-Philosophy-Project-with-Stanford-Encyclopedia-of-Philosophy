    "main_text": "\n\n\nPicture someone who constantly boasts about their accomplishments,\nthinks they know it all, and, even when they\u2019re not talking,\nexudes an off-putting smug self-satisfaction. Such a person seems to\nhave an ethical shortcoming; what they\u2019re missing, you might\nthink to yourself, is a bit of modesty or humility. Modesty and\nhumility are ways that we relate to ourselves, to our own goodness and\nlimitations. It involves placing ourselves among others and in the\nworld at large. Immodest people have, among other things, an inflated\nsense of themselves, their accomplishments, and their place in the\nworld.\n\n\nPhilosophers have been particularly drawn to the seemingly paradoxical\naspects of modesty and humility. Saying \u201cI\u2019m modest\u201d\nsounds like a self-undermining joke in a way that saying\n\u201cI\u2019m compassionate\u201d does not. If it is a virtue, it\nseems like realizing that you have it somehow spoils it. This raises a\nrange of questions about whether there are special requirements\ngoverning how we relate to our own states, traits, or\nachievements.\n\n\nThe first section discusses conceptions of modesty and humility and\ntheir key features and gives a brief historical overview of debates\nabout whether or not they\u2019re really virtues at all. The second\nsection discusses theories of modesty and humility that root them in\nthe presence or absence of particular beliefs. The third section\ncovers a wide range of recent accounts that appeal to non-doxastic\nstates such as emotion, desire, and attention. The final section\nconsiders related phenomena in epistemology: rational limits on\nself-ascription of error, attitudes to disagreement, and openness to\nalternative views.\n",
