    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Logics of Extreme Probabilities\n5.7 Logics of Extreme Probabilities\n\nLehmann and Magidor (Lehmann and Magidor 1992) noticed an interesting\ncoincidence: the metalogical conditions for preferential consequence\nrelations correspond exactly to the axioms for a logic of conditionals\ndeveloped by Ernest W. Adams (Adams\n1975).[4]\nAdams\u2019s logic was based on a conditional, \\(\\Rightarrow\\),\nintended to represent a relation of very high conditional probability:\n\\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\) means that the conditional probability\n\\(Pr(q/p)\\) is extremely close to 1. Adams used the standard\ndelta-epsilon definition of the calculus to make this idea\nprecise. Let us suppose that a theory \\(T\\) consists of a set of\nconditional-free formulas (the facts) and a set of probabilistic\nconditionals. A conclusion \\(p\\) follows defeasibly from \\(T\\) if and\nonly if every probability function satisfies the following\ncondition:\n\nFor every \\(\\delta\\), there is an \\(\\varepsilon\\) such that, if the probability\nof every fact in \\(T\\) is assigned a probability at least as high\nas \\(1 - \\varepsilon\\), and every conditional in \\(T\\) is\nassigned a conditional probability at least as high as \\(1 -\n\\varepsilon\\), then the probability of the conclusion \\(p\\) is at\nleast \\(1 - \\delta\\).\n\nThe resulting defeasible consequence relation is a preferential\nrelation. (It need not, however, be consistency-preserving.) This\nconsequence relation also corresponds to a relation, 0-entailment,\ndefined by Judea Pearl (Pearl 1990), as the common core to all\ndefeasible consequence relations.\n\nLehmann and Magidor (1992) proposed a variation on Adams\u2019s idea.\nInstead of using the delta-epsilon construction, they made use of\nnonstandard measure theory, that is, a theory of probability functions\nthat can take values that are infinitesimals (infinitely\nsmall numbers). In addition, instead of defining the consequence\nrelation by quantifying over all probability functions,\nLehmann and Magidor assume that we can select a single probability\nfunction (representing something like the ideally rational, or\nobjective probability). On their construction, a conclusion \\(p\\)\nfollows from \\(T\\) just in case the probability of \\(p\\) is\ninfinitely close to 1, on the assumption that the probabilities\nassigned to members of \\(T\\) are infinitely close to 1. Lehmann\nand Magidor proved that the resulting consequence relation is always\nnot only preferential: it is also rational. The logic defined\nby Lehmann and Magidor also corresponds exactly to the theory of\nPopper functions, another extension of probability theory designed to\nhandle cases of conditioning on propositions with infinitesimal\nprobability (see Harper 1976; van Fraassen 1995; Hawthorne 1998). For\na brief discussion of Popper functions, see the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nPopper Functions\n\n\nArl\u00f3 Costa and Parikh, using van Fraassen\u2019s account (van\nFraassen, 1995) of primitive conditional probabilities (a variant of\nPopper functions), proved a representation result for both finite and\ninfinite languages (Arl\u00f3 Costa and Parikh, 2005). For infinite\nlanguages, they assumed an axiom of countable additivity for\nprobabilities.\n\nKraus, Lehmann, and Magidor proved that, for every preferential\nconsequence relation \\(\\dproves\\) that is probabilistically\n admissible,[5]\n there is a unique rational consequence relation \\(\\dproves^*\\) that\nminimally extends it (that is, that the intersection of all the\nrational consequence relations extending \\(\\dproves\\) is also a\nrational consequence relation). This relation, \\(\\dproves^*\\), is\ncalled the rational closure of \\(\\dproves\\). To find the\nrational closure of a preferential relation, one can perform the\nfollowing operation on a preferential structure that supports that\nrelation: assign to each model in the structure the smallest number\npossible, respecting the preference relation. Judea Pearl also\nproposed the very same idea under the name\n1-entailment or System \\(Z\\) (Pearl 1990).\n\nA critical advantage to the Lehmann-Magidor-Pearl 1-entailment system\nover Adams\u2019s epsilon-entailment lies in the way in which\n1-entailment handles irrelevant information. Suppose, for example,\nthat we know that birds fly \\((B \\Rightarrow F)\\), Tweety is\na bird \\((B)\\), and Nemo is a whale \\((W)\\). These premises\ndo not epsilon-entail \\(F\\) (that Tweety flies), since there is\nno guarantee that a probability function assign a high probability to\n\\(F\\), given the conjunction of \\(B\\) and\n\\(W\\). In contrast, 1-entailment does give us the conclusion\n\\(F\\).\n\nMoreover, 1-entailment satisfies a condition of weak independence\nof defaults: conditionals with logically unrelated antecedents\ncan \u201cfire\u201d independently of each other: one can warrant a\nconclusion even though we are given an explicit exception to the\nother. Consider, for example, the following case: birds fly \\((B\n\\Rightarrow F)\\), Tweety is a bird that doesn\u2019t fly \\((B \\amp\n\\neg F)\\), whales are large \\((W \\Rightarrow L)\\), and Nemo is a whale\n\\((W)\\). These premises 1-entail that Nemo is large \\((L)\\). In\naddition, 1-entailment automatically satisfies the principle of\nSpecificity: conditionals with more specific antecedents are always\ngiven priority over those with less specific antecedents.\n\nThere is another form of independence, strong independence,\nthat even 1-entailment fails to satisfy. If we are given one exception\nto a rule involving a given antecedent, then we are unable to use any\nconditional with the same antecedent to derive any conclusion\nwhatsoever. Suppose, for example, that we know that birds fly \\((B\n\\Rightarrow F)\\), Tweety is a bird that doesn\u2019t fly \\((B \\amp\n\\neg F)\\), and birds lay eggs \\((B \\Rightarrow E)\\). Even under\n1-entailment, the conclusion that Tweety lays eggs \\((E)\\) fails to\nfollow. This failure to satisfy Strong Independence is also known\nas the Drowning Problem (since all conditionals with the same\nantecedent are \u201cdrowned\u201d by a single exception).\n\nA consensus is growing that the Drowning Problem should not be\n\u201csolved\u201d (see Pelletier and Elio 1994; Wobcke 1995, 85;\nBonevac, 2003, 461\u2013462). Consider the following variant on the\nproblem: birds fly, Tweety is a bird that doesn\u2019t fly, and birds\nhave strong forelimb muscles. Here it seems we should refrain from\nconcluding that Tweety has strong forelimb muscles, since there is\nreason to doubt that the strength of wing muscles is causally (and\nhence, probabilistically) independent of capacity for flight. Once we\nknow that Tweety is an exceptional bird, we should refrain from\napplying other conditionals with Tweety is a bird as their\nantecedents, unless we know that these conditionals are independent of\nflight, that is, unless we know that the conditional with the stronger\nantecedent, Tweety is a non-flying bird, is also true.\n\nNonetheless, several proposals have been made for securing strong\nindependence and solving the Drowning Problem. Geffner and Pearl\n(Geffner and Pearl 1992) proposed a system of conditional\nentailment, a variant of circumscription, in which the preference\nrelation on models is defined in terms of the sets of defaults that\nare satisfied. This enables Geffner and Pearl to satisfy both the\nSpecificity principle and Strong Independence. Another proposal is the\nmaximum entropy approach (Pearl 1988, 490\u2013496; Goldszmidt,\nMorris and Pearl, 1993; Pearl 1990). A theory \\(T\\), consisting\nof defaults \\(\\Delta\\) and facts \\(F\\), entails \\(p\\) just in\ncase the probability of \\(p\\), conditional on \\(F\\),\napproaches 1 as the probabilities associated with \\(\\Delta\\) approach 1,\nusing the\n entropy-maximizing[6]\n probability function that respects the defaults in \\(\\Delta\\). The\nmaximum-entropy approaches satisfies both Specificity and Strong\nIndependence.\n\nEvery attempt to solve the drowning problem (including conditional\nentailment and the maximum-entropy approach) comes at the cost of\nsacrificing cumulativity. Securing strong independence makes the\nsystems very sensitive to the exact form in which the default\ninformation is stored. Consider, for example the following case:\nSwedes are (normally) fair, Swedes are (normally) tall, Jon is a short\nSwede. Conditional entailment and maximum-entropy entailment would\npermit the conclusion that Jon is fair in this case. However, if we\nreplace the first two default conditionals by the single default,\nSwedes are normally both tall and fair, then the conclusion\nno longer follows, despite the fact that the new conditional is\nlogically equivalent to the conjunction of the two original\nconditionals.\n\nApplying the logic of extreme probabilities to real-world defeasible\nreasoning generates an obvious problem, however. We know perfectly\nwell that, in the case of the default rules we actually use, the\nconditional probability of the conclusion on the premises is nowhere\nnear 1. For example, the probability that an arbitrary bird can fly is\ncertainly not infinitely close to 1. This problem resembles that of\nusing idealizations in science, such as frictionless planes and ideal\ngases. It seems reasonable to think that, in deploying the machinery\nof defeasible logic, we indulge in the degree of make-believe\nnecessary to make the formal models applicable. Nonetheless, this is\nclearly a problem warranting further attention.\n",
