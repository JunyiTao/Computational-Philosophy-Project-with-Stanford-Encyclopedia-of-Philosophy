    "main_text": "The Soul of the Universe\n5. The Soul of the Universe\n\nZend-Avesta is Fechner\u2019s most personal work, the\nstatement of his fundamental beliefs. It is nineteenth century\nmetaphysics in the grand style, on a par with Schopenhauer\u2019s\nDie Welt als Wille und Vorstellung and Lotze\u2019s\nMikrokosmus. It is a much more ambitious work than\nNanna. Whereas Nanna would deal strictly with the\nrealm of botany, Zend-Avesta would consider the cosmos as a\nwhole. While Nanna would prove only that plants have souls,\nZend-Avesta would attempt to show that the entire\norganic universe has a\n soul.[10]\n Although this panpsychic doctrine was the inspiration for\nNanna, Fechner, as we have seen, refused to make it the basis\nof his argument. Now, in Zend-Avesta, it will be his purpose\nto prove this doctrine. \n\nZend-Avesta is unapologetically religious. Fechner conceives\nit as a defense of ancient natural religion. In his preface he writes\nthat its purpose is to restore an old belief: \u201cthat all of\nnature is living and divinely ensouled\u201d (ZA: vi).\nZend-Avesta, which means \u201cliving word\u201d in ancient\nPersian, was the sacred text of Zoroastrianism. Fechner hopes that his\nwork will be a new Zend-Avesta (ZA: vii).\n\nAlthough it has a religious agenda, Zend-Avesta was no\ndefense of the Christian faith. Fechner\u2019s natural religion was\ndecidedly not Christianity. His denial of a transcendent dimension\nbeyond nature, his insistence that the mental be embodied in the\nphysical, and his affirmation of a God of nature, all depart\ndrastically from Christian dogma. Still, Fechner was sympathetic to\nChristianity\u2014the faith of his family and fathers\u2014and\nattempted to interpret many of its beliefs in terms of his\n philosophy.[11]\n He conceived his own religion as a synthesis of Christianity and\npaganism (Fechner 1879: 71).\n\nDespite his religious agenda, Fechner insists that he intends to base\nhis faith upon the best science. This work follows a different course\nfrom most Naturphilosophie, he writes, because it does not\nbegin from universal principles and descend to matter of fact; rather,\nit begins from an examination of the particulars of experience and\nascends to the universal. \u201cThe whole tendency of this\nwriting\u201d, he says in the preface, \u201cis that the universal\nrests on the particular rather than the particular on the\nuniversal.\u201d (ZA: xiii) It will show that the realm of\nthe soul is much wider than usually thought, and then proceed to\ndemonstrate that it extends to the universe as a whole. \n\nThere was some equivocation on Fechner\u2019s part on the basis for\nhis natural religion. Although he insisted that it had to be based on\nscience, he had to admit that it could not be based on \u201cexact\nresearch\u201d (ZA: vii, xiv). The very nature of the\nsubject matter did not permit \u201cempirical confirmation and\nmathematical calculation\u201d. Furthermore, he vacillates concerning\nhow it is based on empirical fact. He insists that he will allow only\ninferences based on experience; but then he says that his theory is in\norder as long as it does not contradict the results of science\n(ZA: xiv). He then went on to admit that to believe in the\nsoul of the stars would be always \u201ca matter of faith\u201d\n(Glaubenssache; ZA: 7). \n\nWe should contrast Fechner\u2019s attitude toward religion and\nscience with the materialists of his day (Feuerbach, Vogt,\nB\u00fcchner, Moleschott). It was a major advantage of his philosophy,\nFechner claimed, that it could reconcile science with religion. The\nmaterialists saw this as no advantage at all; they insisted that\nmodern science was moving in the direction of materialism, which made\nit necessary to reject all the religious dogmas of the past. Fechner\nwas well aware of the threat of materialism and did his best to\ncounter it. His constant appeal to science was an attempt to meet the\nmaterialists on their own ground. \n\nTo prove that the universe has a soul, Fechner again follows the\nguiding thread of analogy, just as he did in Nanna. He begins\nby considering the body closest to us: the earth. He finds many\nsimilarities between the earth and our body: both are self-enclosed\npurposive wholes; both consist in solid, fluid, gaseous materials in\nmanifold connections; both go through cycles of changes; both go\nthrough processes of development whereby they become differentiated\nand more finely organized (ZA: 29\u201331). Furthermore, the\nearth has a circulatory system like that of our body (ZA:\n73\u201374). Because of these many similarities, we are justified in\nconcluding, Fechner argues, that the earth is an individual organism\n(ZA: 35). Of course, because it is a much greater organism,\nthere is much in the earth that one does not find in man; but there is\nnothing in man that one does not already find in the earth\n(ZA: 37). The main difference between the human body and the\nearth is that the earth is a higher organism than the body; this is\nbecause it is more independent, self-sufficient, massive and powerful\n(ZA: 31). All the characteristics of the human\norganism\u2014unity, multiplicity, organization and development from\nwithin\u2014the earth has to a greater degree (ZA:\n35\u20136). \n\nHaving demonstrated that the earth is an organism, Fechner proceeds to\nargue that it also has a soul. Because the earth has a body much like\nour own, we are justified, on the basis of analogy, to assume that it\nhas a soul much like our own (ZA: 110\u2013111). If we\nregard freedom as a necessary characteristic of the soul, we should\nalso attribute it to the earth, which is an even more self-sufficient\nand independent being (ZA: 113). All the respects in which\nthe earth is unlike us are only reasons to attribute to it a higher\nsoul (ZA: 115). To the objection that the earth does not have\na nervous system and other organic functions like ours, Fechner\nreplies that, though the presence of these functions proves a soul,\ntheir absence does not disprove the soul either but only the lack of\nan animal or human soul (ZA: 130). It is\neasier to prove that the earth has a soul than plants do, Fechner\nclaims, for the simple reason that we have souls and are part of the\nearth (ZA: 120). We are all parts of the earth, Fechner\nargues at length, and just for that reason the earth must have also a\nsoul, because a soul cannot arise from matter but only another soul\n(ZA: 140\u20131). \n\nFechner conceives the soul of the earth as present within all\nindividual souls, much like Averro\u00ebs famous doctrine of the\nuniversal intellect. All the different representations in one mind\npresuppose a single general consciousness; but the same is the case\nfor the different representations in different minds: they too\npresuppose a general consciousness (ZA: 160\u20131). What we\nperceive or think as an individual mind we perceive or think through\nthe general mind (ZA: 164). This single common consciousness\nin all individual consciousness explains, Fechner believes, how mutual\nunderstanding and communication are possible. Although we are\nindependent and self-sufficient with respect to one another, that is\nnot with respect to the higher mind. That I know myself and only\nmyself, and that you know yourself and only yourself, does not prevent\nthe higher spirit from knowing both of us. What is separation\n(Scheidung) for us is only a distinction\n(Unterscheidung) for it. \n\nThe earth is only one planet in the cosmos, and as such only one\norganism within an infinite one, one mind within an infinite one. The\nuniversal organism is nothing less than God, who is the tree of life,\nfrom which everything grows and upon which everything depends\n(ZA: 23). God is not above space and time, Fechner\ninsists, but he is within them. He not only does\neverything in all things, but he is everything in all things\n(ZA: 200). \u201cGod is the one and all\u201d (ZA:\n223), Fechner says, endorsing the hen kai pan of the\nGoethezeit. The external world of appearances is not opposed\nto God, but it is simply his external side (ZA: 201).\nGod\u2019s spirit does not stand outside the material world but\nexpresses itself in and through it. Fechner distinguishes between a\nnarrower and broader concept of God: the narrow concept is God as\nspirit alone; the broader concept is spirit and its\nembodiment in the world (ZA: 200\u20131). In the same way,\nhe says, we talk about a person as a personality but also as a whole\nbeing involving its body. But it is noteworthy that Fechner says that\nGod in the narrow sense, i.e., God as a pure spirit, is only an\nabstraction (ZA: 204). The concept of the world in a broad\nsense, in which it includes spiritual and physical existence,\ncoincides with the concept of God (ZA: 204). Fechner admits\nthat, in this sense, his view is pantheistic, but he insists that it\nis not so in the Hegelian sense in which the spirit exists\nonly in its individual manifestations. \n",
