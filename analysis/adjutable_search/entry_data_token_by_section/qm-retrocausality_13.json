    "main_text": "Developments Towards a Retrocausal Model || The Two-State Vector Formalism\n6.1 The Two-State Vector Formalism\n\nWhat is now known as the two-state vector formalism was first proposed\nby Watanabe (1955), and then rediscovered by Aharonov, Bergmann, and\nLebowitz (1964). The proposal is that the usual forward evolving\nquantum state contains insufficient information to completely specify\na quantum system; rather the forward evolving state must be\nsupplemented by a backward evolving state to provide a complete\nspecification. Thus, according to the two-state vector formalism, the\ncomplete quantum description contains a state vector that evolves\nforward in time from the initial boundary condition towards the\nfuture, and a state vector that evolves backward in time from the\nfuture boundary condition towards the past. It is only a combination\nof complete measurements at both initial and final boundaries that can\nprovide a complete specification of a quantum system. The two-state\nvector formalism is empirically equivalent to standard quantum\nmechanics (Aharonov & Vaidman 1991, 2008).\n\nThe emphasis of the two-state vector formalism is on the operational\nelements of the theory, and there are very few ontological\nprescriptions, including how best to understand causality. It is in\nprinciple compatible with a variety of supplemented retrocausal\nontologies, e.g., the causally symmetric Bohm model\n (\u00a76.3).\n",
