    "main_text": "Equilibrium selection\n5. Equilibrium selection\n\n\nLewis requires that a convention be one among several possible\nalternatives. Even if one follows Miller in rejecting that requirement,\nit seems clear that there are many cases, such as the choice of\nmonetary currency, where we must select from among numerous candidate\nconventions. This raises the question of how we select a particular\ncandidate. An analogous question arises for game theory more generally,\nsince a game may have many Nash equilibria. It is rational to play my\npart in a Nash equilibrium, if I believe that other agents will\nplay their parts. But why should I believe that others will play\ntheir parts in this particular equilibrium? If we assume that players\ncannot engage in pre-game communication, three basic answers suggest\nthemselves: players converge upon a unique equilibrium through rational\nreflection on the logic of their strategic situation; or they are\nguided by psychological factors outside the ambit of purely rational\nanalysis; or they learn from prior experience which equilibrium to\nchoose. One might also combine these three suggestions with one\nanother.\n\n\nA venerable game-theoretic tradition embraces the first\nsuggestion. The hope is that, if we assume enough common knowledge\namong players about the game\u2019s payoff structure and their own\nrationality, then, through relatively a priori reasoning,\nthey can successfully predict which equilibrium others will select. An\nearly example of this explanatory tradition is the method of backwards\ninduction, introduced by Ernst Zermelo (1913). The tradition\nculminates in John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten\u2019s A General Theory\nof Equilibrium Selection (1988). However, few researchers still\nchampion this tradition. Its basic flaw is already apparent from our\nsimplest coordination problem, Restaurant Rendezvous. Nothing\nintrinsic either to rationality or to the logic of the situation\nfavors one equilibrium over the other. Indeed, Harsanyi and Selten\u2019s\ntheory dictates that each player choose a mixed-strategy randomizing\nover Luigi\u2019s and Fabio\u2019s. Clearly, then, Harsanyi and Selten cannot\nexplain how, in a wide variety of cases, people converge upon a\nunique, non-randomized solution. Nor does it seem likely that we can\novercome this difficulty by emending our analysis of rationality or\nrefining our solution concept. Apparently, breaking the tie between\notherwise symmetrical equilibria requires us to supplement the austere\nviewpoint of pure rational analysis with some additional input, either\nfrom human psychology or else from experience.\n",
