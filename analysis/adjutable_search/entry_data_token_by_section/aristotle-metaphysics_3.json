    "main_text": "The Fundamental Principles: Axioms\n4. The Fundamental Principles: Axioms\n\nBefore embarking on this study of substance, however, Aristotle goes\non in Book \u0393 to argue that first philosophy, the most general of\nthe sciences, must also address the most fundamental\nprinciples\u2014the common axioms\u2014that are used in all\nreasoning. Thus, first philosophy must also concern itself with the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (PNC): the principle that \u201cthe\nsame thing cannot at the same time belong and also not belong to the\nsame thing and in the same respect\u201d (1005b19). This,\nAristotle says, is the most certain of all principles, and it is not\njust a hypothesis. It cannot, however, be proved, since it is\nemployed, implicitly, in all proofs, no matter what the subject\nmatter. It is a first principle, and hence is not derived from\nanything more basic.\n\nWhat, then, can the science of first philosophy say about the PNC? It\ncannot offer a proof of the PNC, since the PNC is presupposed by any\nproof one might offer\u2014any purported proof of the PNC would\ntherefore be circular. Aristotle thus does not attempt to prove the\nPNC; in the subsequent chapters of \u0393 he argues, instead, that it\nis impossible to disbelieve the PNC. Those who would claim to deny the\nPNC cannot, if they have any beliefs at all, believe that it is false.\nFor one who has a belief must, if he is to express this belief to\nhimself or to others, say something\u2014he must make an assertion.\nHe must, as Aristotle says, signify something. But the very act of\nsignifying something is possible only if the PNC is accepted. Without\naccepting the PNC, one would have no reason to think that his words\nhave any signification at all\u2014they could not mean one thing\nrather than another. So anyone who makes any assertion has already\ncommitted himself to the PNC. Aristotle thus does not argue that the\nPNC is a necessary truth (that is, he does not try to prove the PNC);\nrather, he argues that the PNC is indubitable. (For more on the PNC,\nsee the discussion in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic)\n",
