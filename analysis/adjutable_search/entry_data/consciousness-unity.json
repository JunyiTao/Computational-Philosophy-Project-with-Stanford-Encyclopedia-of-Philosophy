    "preamble": "\n\nHuman consciousness usually displays a striking unity. When one\nexperiences a noise and, say, a pain, one is not conscious of the\nnoise and then, separately, of the pain. One is conscious of the noise\nand pain together, as aspects of a single conscious experience. Since\nat least the time of Immanuel Kant (1781/7), this phenomenon has been\ncalled the unity of consciousness. More generally, it is\nconsciousness not of A and, separately, of B and,\nseparately, of C, but of\nA-and-B-and-C together, as the contents of\na single conscious state.\n\nHistorically, the notion of the unity of consciousness has played a\nvery large role in thought about the mind. Indeed, as we will see, it\nfigured centrally in some of the most influential arguments about the\nmind from the time of Descartes to the 20th century. In the\nearly part of the 20th century, the notion largely\ndisappeared for a time, but since the 1960s, analytic philosophers and\nothers have begun to pay attention to it again.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n\nThe unity of consciousness was a main concern of most philosophers in\nwhat is often called the \u2018classical modern era\u2019 (roughly,\n1600 to 1900), including Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Hume (in a way; see\nbelow), Reid, Brentano, and James. \n\nConsider a classical argument of Descartes\u2019 for mind-body\ndualism. It starts like this:\n\n\nWhen I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuch as I am only\na thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts, but\napprehend myself to be clearly one and entire. [Descartes 1641: 196]\n\n\n\nDescartes then asserts that if the mind is not made of parts, it\ncannot be made of matter because anything material has parts. He adds\nthat this by itself would be enough to prove dualism, had he not\nalready proven it elsewhere. Notice where it is that I cannot\ndistinguish any parts. It is in \u201cmyself inasmuch as I am only a\nthinking thing\u201d (ibid.); that is, in myself as a\nwhole\u2014which requires unified consciousness of myself as a whole.\nThe claim is that this subject, the target of this unified\nconsciousness, is not a composite of parts. \n\nIn Kant (1781/7), the notion that consciousness is unified is central\nto his \u2018transcendental deduction of the categories\u2019 (see\nthe entry on\n Kant\u2019s view of the mind and consciousness of self\n for a fuller treatment of Kant). There Kant claims that in order to\ntie various objects of experience together into a single unified\nconscious experience of the world, we must be able to apply certain\nconcepts to the items in question. In particular, we have to apply\nconcepts from each of four fundamental categories of concept:\nquantitative, qualitative, relational, and what he called\n\u2018modal\u2019 concepts. Kant\u2019s attempt to link the unity\nof consciousness to the structure of knowledge continues to capture\nthe imaginations of philosophers: Arguments of this form can be found\nin P. F. Strawson (1966), Cassam (1996), Hurley (1994, 1998) and\nRevonsuo (2003), and are examined critically in\n Section 7.3\n and in Brook (2005). \n\nKant was familiar with arguments of the kind that we just saw\nDescartes mount (chiefly from similar reasoning in Leibniz and\nMendelssohn) but he was not impressed. For Kant, that consciousness is\nunified tells us nothing about what sorts of entity minds are,\nincluding whether or not they are made out of matter (1781, chapter on\nthe Paralogisms of Pure Reason). He argues that the achievement of\nunified consciousness by a system of components acting together would\nbe no more or less mysterious than its being achieved by something\nthat is simple, i.e., has no components (1781: A352).\n\nLeibniz, Hume, Reid, Brentano, and James held a variety of positions\non unity. Briefly, for Leibniz (see the entry on\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of mind)\n unified consciousness and the noncompositeness, the indivisibility\nthat he took to be required for it seem to have served as his model of\na monad, the building block of all reality. With Hume (1739), things\nare more complicated. It should have followed from his atomism that\nthere is no unified consciousness, just \u201ca bundle of different\nperceptions\u201d ([1739] 1962: 252). Yet, in a famous appendix, he\nsays that there is something he cannot render consistent with his\natomism (p. 636). He never tells us what it is but it may have been\nthat consciousness strongly appears to be more than a bundle of\nindependent \u2018perceptions\u2019. Reid (1785), almost an exact\ncontemporary of Kant\u2019s, made extensive use of the unity of\nconsciousness, among other things to run Descartes\u2019 argument\nfrom unity to indivisibility the other way around. Brentano (1874)\nargued that all the conscious states of a person at a time will and\nperhaps must be unified with one another. (He combined this view with\nanother strong thesis, that all mental states are conscious.) Finally,\nlate in the 19th century James developed a detailed\ntreatment of synchronic (or \u2018at a time\u2019) unity of\nconsciousness. We will discuss his view later (see also entries on\n David Hume,\n Thomas Reid,\n Franz Brentano,\n and\n William James).\n \n\nEarly in the 20th century, the unity of consciousness\nalmost disappeared from the research agenda. Logical atomism in\nphilosophy and behaviourism in psychology had little to say about the\nnotion. Logical atomism focussed on the atomic elements of cognition\n(sense data, simple propositional judgments, protocol sentences,\netc.), rather than on how these elements are tied together to form a\nmind. Behaviourism urged that we focus on behaviour, the mind being\neither a myth or at least something that we cannot and do not need to\nstudy in a science of the human person. \n\nOne partial exception to this pattern of neglect was Gestalt\npsychology. Indeed, Gestalt psychology was sufficiently influential in\nits time that some positivists tried to make their systems compatible\nwith it (Smith 1994: 23). For instance, Carnap chose to avoid any\ncommitment to atoms of experience as the elements of his system,\nopting instead for \u2018total experiences\u2019. As we will see, a\nnotion similar to his concept of irreducible experiential wholes can\nbe fruitful\n (Section 7.4).\n However, Carnap seems to have had something rather different in mind\nfrom what philosophers now have in mind when they speak of the unity\nof consciousness. Gestalt unity is a unity in a structure of which one\nis conscious, where the way in which each part appears is derived from\nthe structure of the whole (Tye 2003: 11\u20135; Bayne & Chalmers\n2003: 27). This is distinct from unity in one\u2019s\nconsciousness of objects, objects that need not themselves\nexhibit the qualities of gestalt structures.\n\nAfter decades of neglect, the last third of the 20th\ncentury saw a resurgence of interest in unified consciousness among\nanalytic philosophers. It began with influential commentaries on Kant\nin the 1960s (Strawson 1966; Bennett 1966, see also his 1974), as well\nas discussions by Nagel (1971) and Parfit (1971, 1984). More recently,\nquite a number of philosophers and a few psychologists have written on\nthe subject, including Marks (1981), Trevarthen (1984), Lockwood\n(1989, 1994), Hill (1991), Brook (1994), Marcel (1994), Hurley (1994,\n1998), Shoemaker (1996, 2003), O\u2019Brien and Opie (1998). The first\ndecades of the 21st century have seen a lot of important\nnew work on the subject: Dainton (2000), Stevenson (2000), Bayne and\nChalmers (2003), Hurley (2003), Kennett and Matthews (2003), Rosenthal\n(2003), Radden (2003),\nTye (2003), Zeki (2003), Nikolinakos (2004), Brook and Raymont (2006),\nLaRock (2007), and Bayne (2008, 2010, the latter a book-length study).\nCleeremans (2003) is an excellent collection containing papers by\nphilosophers such as Bayne, Chalmers, Hurley, Shoemaker, Cotterill,\nand Thompson and psychologists such as Triesman, Humphreys, Engel,\nDiennes, Perner, and Varela. Blackmore (2004, especially ch. 17) is a\ngood, scientifically-oriented introduction. The section on the unity\nof consciousness in PhilPapers has 391 entries (as of April 2017), the\nvast majority from the last twenty years (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n2. Characterizations and Taxonomies\n2.1 Characterizations\n\nWhat characterizes the unity of consciousness? Note that this question\ncan be asked and answered whether or not there is any such\nthing as unified consciousness. Indeed, we need to know what the unity\nof consciousness is like even to address the question of its\nexistence. (For ease of exposition, we will write as though there is\nunified consciousness, even though the question really remains open\nuntil the next section.) \n\nThat said, it should also be noted that it is difficult to say much\nabout the unity of consciousness that is both non-question-begging and\nmore than a thinly disguised synonym, a point that Dainton (2000)\nemphasizes. Even as great a theorist of the subject as Immanuel Kant\nthrew up his hands. He observed that this unity is \u201cnot the\ncategory of unity\u201d (B131), that is to say, is not just a matter\nof being numerically one\u2014and said no more. \n\nUnderlying the various attempts to identify what is characteristic\nabout the unity of consciousness are two opposing views of the\nstructure of a unified conscious experience. On what we will call the\nexperiential parts view (EP), a unified conscious experience is a\ncomposite of other experiences. The no experiential parts view (NEP)\ndenies this, asserting that while a unified conscious experience will\nhave a complex object or content, it has no experiential parts. On\nthis view, when the objects of particular experiences get incorporated\ninto a \u2018bigger\u2019 unified experience, the new experience\nreplaces the particular experiences rather than containing them as\nparts. It would be premature to discuss the two views here (see\nSections\n 7.1\n and\n 7.2)\n but we need to know about them to understand the attempts that have\nbeen made to characterize unity. The first two ways of characterizing\nthe unity of consciousness that we will examine are within the\nexperiential parts approach. \n2.1.1 Subsumption\n\nOne increasingly prominent attempt to characterize the unity of\nconsciousness holds that in unified consciousness, particular\nexperiences are subsumed in a more complex experience. For example,\nBayne and Chalmers (2003) say that when particular experiences are\nunified, they are \u201caspects of a single encompassing state of\nconsciousness\u201d (see also Bayne 2010: 20, 31). More precisely,\ntwo experiences are what they call \u2018subsumptively unified\u2019\n\u201cwhen they are both subsumed by a single state of\nconsciousness\u201d (2010: 27). This yields a distinctive\nphenomenology. Two subsumptively unified states will have what they\ncall a conjoint phenomenology: a phenomenology of having both states\nat once that subsumes the phenomenology of the individual states:\n\u201cthere is something it is like for the subject to be in [two\nconscious] states simultaneously\u201d (2010: 32). \n\nOne feature of subsumption is that it requires there to be\nexperiential parts. Thus, those who favour NEP or even wish a\ncharacterization of unified consciousness to be neutral on this issue\nwill look for a different account. \n2.1.2 Co-Consciousness\n\nA second attempt to characterize unified consciousness claims that a\nrelation among local conscious states is the crucial element, a\nrelation usually called co-consciousness. As James\n \n put it, in synchronic unified consciousness, we are co-conscious of\nA, B, and C (1909: 221). Others who centre their\nanalysis on the notion include Parfit (1984) and Hurley (1998). These\ntheorists seldom try to define the term\n\u2018co-consciousness\u2019. They treat the notion as being\nintuitively clear and let it function as a primitive in their\nanalysis.\n\nLike subsumption, most versions of co-consciousness require\nexperiential parts (James, who accepted NEP and thus had an unusual\nconception of co-consciousness, is an exception). In addition to a\nproblem of lack of neutrality, this requirement faces the problem that\nsome forms of unified consciousness do not seem to involve\nmultiplicity of items, unified consciousness of self for example. If\nthere is no multiplicity of items, there is nothing to enter into a\n\u2018co\u2019-relationship. \n\nA number of theorists combine the two approaches. Many of the people\nwho use the term \u2018co-consciousness\u2019 in fact seem to have\nsubsumption in mind as the underlying notion. Dainton, for example,\nembraces the language of co-consciousness and relates the notion\nto\u201cbeing experienced together\u201d [subsumption] (2000: 236)\nbut urges in the end that co-consciousness is a better primitive than\nsubsumption (Dainton 2005: 258\u2013259). Or Lockwood (1989: 88):\nco-consciousness is \u201cthe relation in which two experiences\nstand, when there is an experience of which they are both\nparts\u201d. Similarly Shoemaker (2003: 65): \u201cThe experiences\nare co-conscious \u2026 by virtue of the fact that they are\ncomponents of a single state of consciousness \u2026 \u201d. \n2.1.3 Joint Consciousness\n\nThere are at least two approaches to what characterizes unified\nconsciousness that are compatible with NEP. One we find in Tye. In\nunified conscious states, the things that we experience are\n\u201cexperienced together\u201d, \u201center into the same\nphenomenal content\u201d (2003: 36, his\nemphasis)\u2014which phenomenal content could be the content of a\nsingle non-composite experience. \n\nAnother has been advanced by Brook and Raymont (Brook 1994: 38; Brook\n2000; Brook & Raymont 2006). The key idea is what they call joint\nconsciousness. Joint consciousness is present when the following\nholds: If an experience that one is having provides consciousness of\nany item, then it provides consciousness of other items and of at\nleast some of the items as a group. Likewise for consciousness of acts\nof experiencing. \n\nThis notion tries to capture what is distinctive about unified\nconsciousness in a way that is neutral with respect to the EP/NEP\ndebate. The notion is related to the phenomenal side of the\nBayne/Chalmers notion of subsumption, there being something it is like\nto be in two conscious states simultaneously (Bayne & Chalmers\n2003: 32), but in a way that is free of the non-neutral notion of\nsubsumption. It is not clear whether joint consciousness is an\nalternative to Tye\u2019s notion of same phenomenal content or an\nattempt to say something about what yields such content. \n2.2 Taxonomies\n\nMost contemporary theorists agree that unified consciousness can take\na number of forms. Many schemes for dividing it up exist in the\nliterature. Tye (2003: 11\u20135), for example, distinguishes object\nunity, neurophysiological unity, spatial unity, subject unity,\nintrospective unity, and, finally, phenomenal unity. The latter is the\nnotion that he explicates in terms of contents being experienced\ntogether, entering into the same phenomenal content, and is the notion\non which he focuses. \n\nSimilarly, Bayne and Chalmers (2003: 24\u20137) distinguish objectual\nunity (a matter of two conscious experiences of one object, so\ndifferent from Tye\u2019s object unity), spatial unity, subject\nunity, and subsumptive unity, the last a matter of two or more\nconscious states becoming aspects of a single conscious state. Then\nwithin subsumptive unity, they distinguish between access unity and\nphenomenal unity. We just examined their definition of the latter. As\nis true of Tye, it is what mainly interests them. Two conscious states\nare phenomenally unified \u201cif there is something it is like for\nthe subject to be in both conscious states simultaneously\u201d. \n\nKant and philosophers in the Kantian tradition break phenomenal unity\ndown. The division usually follows the traditional division of\nexperience into subject, representation, and object or content,\nassigning to each its own form of unified consciousness. Thus there\nwill be unified consciousness of individual objects, of multiples of\nobjects, of acts of experiencing, and of oneself as the subject of\nsuch experiencing. (A fifth form can be distinguished, too, as we will\nsee.) Few contemporary theorists break phenomenal unity down at all,\nso this division is of some interest.\n\nThe first three forms of unified consciousness in the Kantian\ntradition can be expressed in terms of the notion of joint\nconsciousness just introduced. First, unified consciousness of\nindividual objects. This is Tye\u2019s object unity; Bayne and\nChalmers\u2019 objectual unity is at least a related notion. The\nprocess at work here is now commonly called binding (Hardcastle 1998;\nRevonsuo 1999). Binding is the process of tying various features of a\nvisual scene such as colour, shape, edges, and contours, features\ndetected in various places in the visual cortex, together into an\nexperience of a unified, three-dimensional object. Binding may be\nnecessary for consciousness of individual objects but it does not seem\nto be sufficient. We must, it seems, also be jointly conscious of the\nvarious elements to have unified consciousness of an object. \n\nNext, unified consciousness of contents. In unified\nconsciousness of contents, if an experience that one is having\nprovides consciousness of any object or content, then it provides\nconsciousness of other objects or contents and of at least some of the\nitems as a group. Here \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018item\u2019\ncover objects, properties, events\u2014anything of which one can be\nconscious. (We speak of experiences rather than representations in\ndeference to those who doubt that we experience in representations, or\nneed do so: we wish to be neutral on this issue.)\n\nThis distinction between unified consciousness of individual objects\nand of multiples of objects corresponds closely to two kinds of\nsynthesis distinguished by Kant (1781/7, First Division, Book 1,\nChapter 2). Kant distinguishes between the kind of acts of synthesis\nneeded to attain consciousness of individual objects and the kind of\nacts of synthesis needed to attain consciousness of a number of\nobjects at the same time as a single array of objects experienced by a\nsingle subject (Brook 1994: 123). He builds his argument for necessary\ncausal connectedness on the latter.\n\nUnified consciousness of contents appears to be central to our kind of\nconsciousness. For example, suppose that one is conscious of\none\u2019s computer and also of the car sitting in one\u2019s\ndriveway. If consciousness of these two items were not unified, an\nimportant, indeed probably the most important, way of comparing them\nwould not be available. One could not answer questions such as, Is the\ncar the same colour as the WordPerfect icon?, or even, Is the car to\nthe left or to the right of the computer? That is what unified\nconsciousness does for us: it allows us to make such comparisons.\nSince relating item to item in this and related ways is fundamental to\nour kind of cognition, unified consciousness is fundamental to our\nkind of cognition. As we will see in\n Section 4.1,\n there are disorders of consciousness in which this ability to compare\nseems to be lost. These disorders leave people with a massive\ncognitive impairment. \n\nMost theorists outside of philosophy and many within accept that there\nis a second form of conscious unity related to unified consciousness\nof contents, namely, unified consciousness of acts of\nexperiencing. It is present when, for the current acts of\nexperiencing that one is doing, consciousness of one act of\nexperiencing (consciousness of how one is experiencing something, for\nexample seeing it, imagining it, \u2026) provides consciousness of other\nacts of experiencing. (This explication is structured to be neutral as\nto whether unified conscious states include a multiplicity of\nconscious states. We speak of \u2018consciousness of acts of\nexperiencing\u2019 rather than \u2018consciousness of an\nexperience\u2019 for the same reason.)\n\nNot all theorists accept that this second form of unified\nconsciousness exists. Those who promote the so-called transparency\nthesis, the claim that we are not directly conscious of our own\nexperiencings, deny that we have any such form of consciousness\n(Dretske 1995; Tye 2003). Tye, for example, says that when we hear\nsomething, we are not conscious of the auditory experience, just what\nit represents. If one tries to be conscious of the experience, at best\none is aware only of \u201cthe auditory qualities that the experience\nrepresents\u201d (2003: 33).\n\nMany theorists have also had a fourth thing in mind when they speak of\nthe unity of consciousness, namely, unified consciousness of\noneself, the thing that has the experiences. Here, one is or\ncertainly seems to be (see the discussion of Rosenthal in\n Section 3.1)\n conscious of oneself not just as subject but, in Kant\u2019s words\n(A350), as the \u2018single common subject\u2019 of many or all the\naspects of the unified experience that one is now having and of a\nnumber of similar experiences past and, in anticipation, still to\ncome. (Mutatis mutandis, the same holds for the single common\nagent of various bits of deliberation and action.) One has unified\nconsciousness of self when one is conscious of oneself as the single\ncommon subject of experiences of many items in many acts of\nexperiencing. \n\nThe unified consciousness here seems not to be a matter of joint\nconsciousness. When one is conscious of oneself as the common subject\nof one\u2019s current unified acts of experiencing and of unified\nacts of experiencing past and to come, one is not conscious of a\nnumber of objects, nor a number of acts of experiencing either.\n(Indeed, if Kant is right, when one is conscious of oneself as\nsubject, one need not be conscious of oneself as an object at\nall (A382, A402, B429).) However, something similar might be at work.\nOne seems to be conscious of one and the same thing as one and the\nsame thing, namely, oneself, via a number of acts of\nexperiencing.\n\nUnified consciousness of self has been argued to have some very\nspecial properties, for example that the reference to oneself as\noneself by which one achieves consciousness of oneself as subject must\nbe indexical and cannot make use of \u2018identification\u2019\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1966; Shoemaker 1968; Perry 1979). Generalizing the\nlatter notion, it has been claimed that reference to self does not\nproceed by way of attribution of properties or features to oneself at\nall (Brook 2001). One argument for this view is that one is or could\nbe conscious of oneself in the same way as the subject of each and\nevery one of one\u2019s conscious experiences. If so, one would not\nbe conscious of oneself as one kind of thing rather than another. As\nBennett (1974: 80) once put it, consciousness of self would not be\n\u2018experience-dividing\u2019\u2014statements expressing it would\nhave \u201cno direct implications of the form \u2018I shall\nexperience C rather than D\u2019\u201d. And if that is\nso, one\u2019s consciousness of self might not be gained via being\nconscious of features of oneself at all\n\nSome theorists especially in the empirical literature hold that a\nfifth form of phenomenal experience should attract the label,\n\u2018unified consciousness\u2019. We might call it unity of\nfocal attention. It differs from the other forms of unified\nconsciousness that we have delineated. In the others, consciousness\nranges over either many experienced items (unified consciousness of\ncontents), experiencings of many objects (unified consciousness of\nexperiencing), or multiple acts of access to oneself as subject of\nmany experiencings (unified consciousness of self). Unity of focus\npicks out something within these unified \u2018fields\u2019. Wilhelm\nWundt captured what we have in mind in his distinction between the\nfield of consciousness (Blickfeld) and the focus of\nconsciousness (Blickpunkt; Wundt [1874] 1893: Vol. II, 67).\nThe consciousness of a single item on which one is focussing is\nunified because one is conscious of many aspects of the item\nin one state or act of consciousness (especially relational aspects,\ne.g., any dangers it poses, how it relates to one\u2019s goals,\netc.), and of many different considerations with respect to that item\n(one\u2019s goals, how well one is achieving them with respect to\nthis object, etc.), in the same state or act of consciousness. In\nunified focal attention, one integrates a number of cognitive\nabilities and applies them to an object. Bayne and\nChalmers\u2019 objectual unity is a related notion (2003:\n24\u201325). Note that, if there are forms of unified consciousness\ndifferent from focal attention, then, contrary to Posner (1994) and\nothers, attention is not a component of all forms of consciousness\n(Hardcastle 1997). \n\nAll five of the forms of phenomenal unity can, to one degree or\nanother, be attributed to Kant. The first four are clearly Kantian but\nthere is a connection to him even with respect to the fifth. He\ndidn\u2019t speak of attention very often but he did speak of it.\nSee, for example, B156n.\n\nSince Hume ([1739] 1962: 252) and Rosenthal (2003) deny that we have\nsuch unified consciousness of self and Dennett (1991, 1992) says at\nminimum that we have much less of it than we think, it is perhaps\npertinent to say again that in this section we are merely trying to\nsay what the various forms of unity would be like if they exist.\nWhether they do exist is the topic of\n Section 3.\n2.3 Other Forms of Mental Unity\n\nWe will close this section by noting that the forms of unified\nconsciousness distinguished above are not the only kinds of mental\nunity. Earlier we mentioned Gestalt unity. There is also\nunity in the exercise of our cognitive capacities, unity that consists\nof integration of motivating factors, perceptions, beliefs, etc., and\nthere is unity in the outputs, unity that consists of integration of\nbehaviour. \n\nHuman beings bring a strikingly wide range of factors to bear on a\ncognitive task such as seeking to characterize something or trying to\nreach a decision about what to do about something. For example, we can\nbring to bear: what we want; what we believe; our attitudes to self,\nsituation, and context; input from each of our various senses;\ninformation about the situation, other people, others\u2019 beliefs,\ndesires, attitudes, etc.; the resources of however many languages we\nhave available to us; various kinds of memory; bodily sensations;\ndiverse problem-solving skills; and so on. Not only can we bring all\nthese elements to bear, we can integrate them in a way that is highly\nstructured and ingeniously appropriate to our goals and the\nsituation(s) before us. This form of mental unity could appropriately\nbe called unity of cognition.\n\nIt is plausible to hold that unity of cognition is required for unity\nof focal attention. However, there is at least some measure of unified\ncognition in many situations of which we are not conscious, as is\nattested by our ability to balance, control our posture, maneuver\naround obstacles while our consciousness is entirely absorbed with\nsomething else, and so on.\n\nAt the other end of the cognitive process, we find an equally\ninteresting form of unity, what we might call unity of\nbehaviour: our ability to coordinate our limbs, eyes, bodily\nattitude, etc. The precision and complexity of the behavioural\ncoordination we can achieve would be difficult to exaggerate. Think of\na concert pianist performing a complicated work. However, this\ncapacity to unify behaviour, though doubtless a product of unified\nconsciousness, does not figure in what unified consciousness is.\n3. Is Consciousness Unified?\n\nNow that we know what we are talking about when we talk about unified\nconsciousness, the next question to ask is: Does it exist?\nDoes consciousness have the properties that it would need to\nhave to be unified? If this division of questions looks peculiar,\nnotice that it can apply to Santa Claus, too. We can develop an\naccount of what Santa Claus would be like without committing ourselves\non the question of whether such a being exists. However, the division\nmay look peculiar in another way: How could anyone deny that\nconsciousness is unified? That it is seems just obvious. In fact,\nthere has been a good deal of skepticism on the matter.\n\nSome will urge that before we ask whether unified consciousness\nexists, we should first ask, Does consciousness exist? There\nnow seems to be a wide consensus that the answer to this question is,\nYes, there is in us something appropriately called\n\u2018consciousness\u2019. Even those who hold that the\nlong-standing idea that\n intentionality (see entry)\n is a matter of attitudes to propositions is false and ripe for\nelimination, Paul and Patricia Churchland for example, allow that\nconsciousness exists, though they urge that the concept be trimmed a\nbit (see, for example, Patricia Churchland 1983). Some writers have\ntaken Dennett (1991) to deny that consciousness exists, either\ndirectly or by implication. He himself has said repeatedly that\nconsciousness is real, however (1995: 135, 146 are two\nexamples). A few writers, Wilkes (1984) and Rey (1988) for example,\nhave espoused true eliminativist about consciousness but they are a\ntiny minority. \n3.1 Skepticism about Unity\n\nMany philosophers have been sceptical about whether consciousness is\nunified. It is possible to be sceptical about whether all\nconsciousness is unified, whether as many conscious states are unified\nas we might think, and, the strongest form of scepticism here, whether\nthere is any unity of consciousness. Let us examine the three in\nreverse order.\n\nHume ([1739] 1962: 252) seems to have been an example of the strongest\nform of scepticism. He famously doubted, or tried to doubt, that we\nhave unified consciousness even of the self, let alone of one\u2019s\nconscious states. Among recent writers, perhaps the most sceptical\nabout consciousness being unified is Rosenthal. Rosenthal holds that\nall we have is a \u201csense of the unity of\nconsciousness\u201d (1986: 344, emphasis added). Why merely a sense?\nOn his view, \n\n\nMental states are conscious, when they are, in virtue of their being\naccompanied by HOTs [higher-order thoughts] and each HOT represents\nits target as belonging to the individual who also thinks the HOT in\nquestion. (Rosenthal 2002: 15) \n\n\nAcross a range of such self-ascriptions, one develops a sense of being\ntheir common subject. However, this sense could be wrong. The\nexperiences thus ascribed, says Rosenthal, could be supported by or\nlocated in a diversity of subjects. It is because of this possibility\nthat Rosenthal asserts that all we have is a sense of consciousness\nbeing unified. \n\nEven when theorists such as Hume and Rosenthal deny that consciousness\nis unified, sometimes unity of some sort still seems to be at work in\ntheir models. Rosenthal says, for example, \u201cA mental state is\nconscious just in case it is accompanied by a \u2026 thought to the\neffect that one is in the state in question\u201d (2003:\n325, our emphasis). If so, in addition to a HOT being about another\npsychological state, it is also about oneself, the thing that has the\nstate (\u2018that one\u00a0is in the state in\nquestion\u2019). Now, this consciousness of oneself is not\nconsciousness of any old object, it is consciousness of oneself,\noneself as the bearer of conscious states. But this is consciousness\nof oneself as, to use Kant\u2019s phrase, the single common subject\nof one\u2019s experience (1781/7, A350). If so, Rosenthal allows that\none kind of unified consciousness exists despite himself. \n\nMore recently, Nagel (1971), Davidson (1980), Dennett (1991, 1992),\nO\u2019Brien and Opie (1998), and Rosenthal (2003) have all urged in\none way or another that the mind\u2019s unity has been overstated.\nThe point these people make is not just that the mind works mostly out\nof the sight and often out of the control of consciousness. Virtually\neveryone agrees on that and the point would in no way tell against\nthere being a real unity of some kind in the part that does enter\nconsciousness. Rather, they maintain that not even all conscious\nstates are unified with other conscious states. \n\nNote that the claim here is not just that we are conscious of less of\nthe contents of our mind than we think, as Freud and the\npsychoanalytic tradition argue. The claim is that our consciousness of\neven many states of which we are conscious is not, or not fully,\nunified. That we act against what we clearly know to be our own most\ndesired course of action or do things while telling ourselves that we\nmust avoid doing them are advanced as reasons for holding the view but\nthese are not obvious examples of lack of unity. A change blindness\nexperiment might offer a more substantial example.\n\nIn this experiment, a subject sits in front of a computer screen\nwearing an eye tracker visor. There is a paragraph of text on the\nscreen. The subject is asked to read the text. When subject\u2019s\neyes are focused on a particular word or phrase, the bit of text is as\nit should be. However, everything around the word or phrase at\nfixation, everything above, below and on both sides, beyond about 5\ndegrees of arc is chaotic: gibberish, out of order words, shapes\nvaguely like words but obviously not words, and so on. Each time the\nsubject\u2019s eyes shift to a new bit of text, it pops into correct\nform just before the eyes get to it and the word or phrase just left\ngoes strange. What is remarkable about this experiment is that, while\nto observers all appears chaotic except for a succession of words or\nphrases\u2014they are marching to a different saccadic\ndrummer\u2014the subject has no consciousness that anything in the\nparagraph is ever out of the ordinary. If the subject is one of those\npeople who automatically reads any text in front of her, often she has\nno idea that the experiment has even started!\n\nWhat this experiment shows, Dennett (1991: 361\u2013362) thinks, is\nthat we take only a tiny, central bit of the scene in front of us\nfully into unified consciousness. Yet subjects are conscious of the\nrest of the screen in some ways. They are aware of movement, for\nexample. If so, this experiment would be an example of conscious\nstates that are not fully taken up into unified consciousness. We\nwould have unified consciousness of fewer of our conscious states than\nhas been thought.\n\nNote that the argument just examined is not an argument that unified\nconsciousness does not exist. Even if we have conscious states that\nare not unified or fully unified in consciousness, the most that that\ncould force us to do would be to shrink the range of states over which\nconsciousness is unified or fully unified. From the fact that not all\nof one\u2019s conscious contents are unified, it does not follow that\nnone is. \n\nIndeed, those who hold that the extent to which consciousness is\nunified has been overstated owe us an account of what has\nbeen overstated. When theorists claim that a some conscious states are\nnot in unified consciousness, we should ask: Not unified with what?\nOne plausible answer would be: The unified conscious mind. Here is one\nway to view the matter. Once upon a time, some theorists held that all\nconscious states are unified and indeed that all mental states are\nconscious. As we saw, Brentano is an example. (We will return to this\nview in the next Section.) The main difference between this\npre-twentieth century vision of unified consciousness as ranging over\neverything in the mind and view we just examined is that on the latter\nview, less of consciousness is unified than the earlier view held.\n\nDennett is interesting in this regard. As we saw, he can plausibly be\nread as rejecting the traditional picture of unified consciousness.\nYet he can still invoke unity. He says, \u201cWhat is it like to be\nan ant colony? Nothing, I submit \u2026 What is it like to be a\nbrace of oxen? Nothing (even if it is like something to be a single\nox)\u201d (Dennett 2005). Why is the answer nothing? In such cases,\n\u201cthere is no functional unity \u2026\u2014no unity to\ndistinguish an I from a we\u201d (Dennett 2005).\n\n\nTo sum up the discussion of scepticism about unified consciousness so\nfar, the argument that the unity of consciousness is real, indeed is a\ncentral feature of our kind of mind, seems to be strong.\n3.2 Consciousness Must be Unified\n\nThat said, there are theorists who maintain not only that some\nconscious states in a subject are unified but that all conscious\nstates must be unified. Bayne and Chalmers (2003: 24; Bayne\n2010: ch. 1.4) call this the unity thesis: necessarily, any\nset of conscious states of a subject at a time is unified. As we saw,\nBrentano probably held this view. Hill (1991) does, too. Scepticism\nabout this view would be weaker than either of the two kinds of\nscepticism about unified consciousness that we just examined.\n\nBayne and Chalmers express sympathy for the thesis on the grounds\nthat, \n\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to imagine a subject having two\nphenomenal states simultaneously, without there being a conjoint\nphenomenology for both states. (2003: 37) \n\n\nMerely having phenomenal states might seem too little but\nBayne and Chalmers are talking about phenomenal states where, for\nthem, to have the state is for the state to be like something. If we\nrecast to make this element explicit, we get a claim of some real\nintuitive appeal: If A is like something to S and\nB is like something to S, it must be the case that the\ncombination, A and B, is like something to S.\nInterestingly, Kant seems to have believed something similar:\n\u201c[Experiences] can represent something to me only insofar as\nthey belong with all others to one consciousness\u201d (A116).\nA and B having conjoint phenomenology is exactly what\nunity consists in, according to Bayne and Chalmers. Put this way, the\nunity thesis has some real appeal.\n\nAre there reasons to be sceptical of the unity thesis, presumptive\ncounter-examples say? Spelled out as we have spelled it out, we do not\nknow of any. Bayne and Chalmers consider brain bisection cases to be\nputative counter-examples because, on some concepts of the subject of\nexperience, we can think of there still being one subject in these\ncases even though not all the conscious states are unified. There are\nat least three ways to respond. The simplest is just to deny that\nthere is one subject, at least for the period of the split. A second\nwould be to note that, however one counts subjects during the period\nof the split, there is evidence that many conscious experiences in\nthat body are not like anything to some subject. If so, the apparent\nlack of conjoint consciousness of them will not be a problem.\nA third (advocated by Bayne & Chalmers 2003: 38\u20139; Bayne\n2010: ch. 9) would be to urge that while there is clearly a breach in\nthe unity of access consciousness (access to information for purposes\nof belief formation, behavioural control, and so on) during the period\nof the split, phenomenal unity may still extend across all the\nconscious experience. We will discuss the third response in more\ndetail in\n Section 4.2\n below.\n\nThe unity thesis is a very strong thesis. Theorists could hold both\nthat consciousness is unified and that this unity is important and yet\ndeny that the unity thesis is true. \n4. Disorders of Unified Consciousness\n\nOne of the most interesting ways to study psychological phenomena is\nto see what happens when they take an abnormal form or break down.\nPhenomena that look simple and seamless when functioning smoothly\noften reveal all sorts of structure when they begin to malfunction.\nThe unity of consciousness can be damaged and/or distorted in both\nnaturally-occurring and experimental situations. What can we learn\nfrom these cases? \n\nAs a rough grouping tool, we will treat unified consciousness as\nbreaking down in ways that fit a two-by-two matrix. The cases we will\nconsider can be grouped according to whether unified consciousness\nappears to continue but in an unusual form, one instance of it\nsplitting into two for example, and situations in which it appears to\ndeteriorate more severely, to the point where it may even be said to\nhave been destroyed. And we will find examples of both kinds that\noccur at a time and across time. Indeed, some of the disorders that we\nwill examine are both at a time and across time.\n\nAt a time, situations of disorder in which unified consciousness is\nretained may take a number of forms. There are cases where\nconsciousness seems to split within one brain and body. The much\ndiscussed commissurotomies (brain bisection operations) are the best\nknown example. (Across time, the closest analogue may be dissociative\nidentity disorder, about which more shortly.) There may be cases in\nwhich a single occurrence of unified consciousness spans two bodies;\nsome have said this about some mirror twins. And there are cases in\nwhich the array of phenomena over which unified consciousness ranges\nbecomes strangely circumscribed: hemi-neglect and anosognosia are two\nexamples. (We will describe all these phenomena in more detail below.)\nWhat is interesting for our purposes is that in all these kinds of\ncases, those in which unified conscious seems to split, those (if any)\nin which it seems to span two bodies, and those in which its range\nseems to shrink, the unity itself seem to be intact. It has not been\ndestroyed or even damaged. It is just housed in an unusual way.\n\nThe cases just introduced contrast with situations in which we have\njust one instance of consciousness of some kind ranging over the usual\nphenomena or some of them, but where the unity, to dramatize a bit,\nappears to have shattered, not split or expanded or shrunk. In these\ncases, the unity of consciousness is not just unusually housed. It has\nbeen seriously compromised.\n4.1 Some Disorders\n4.1.1 Brain Bisection Operations\n\nNo medical procedure to do with consciousness has received as much\nphilosophical attention in recent times as commissurotomies, more\ncommonly known as brain bisection operations. Nagel (1971) was perhaps\nthe first philosopher to write on them; his paper continues to be\ninfluential. Since then, Puccetti (1973, 1981), Marks (1981), Hirsch\n(1991), Lockwood (1989), Hurley (1998), Bayne (2008, 2010), Schechter\n(2010) and many, many other philosophers have written on these\noperations. Indeed, the strange results of these operations in certain\ncontrolled conditions was one of the things that brought the unity of\nconsciousness back onto the cognitive research agenda. \n\nIn these operations, the corpus callosum is cut. The corpus callosum\nis a large strand of about 200,000,000 neurons running from one\nhemisphere to the other. When present, it is the chief channel of\ncommunication between the hemispheres. These operations, done mainly\nin the 1960s but recently reintroduced in a somewhat modified form,\nare a last-ditch effort to control certain kinds of severe epilepsy by\nstopping the spread of seizures from one lobe of the cerebral cortex\nto the other. For details, see Sperry (1984), Zaidel et al. (1993), or\nGazzaniga (2000).\n\nIn normal life, patients show little effect of the operation. In\nparticular, their consciousness of their world and themselves appears\nto remain as unified as it was prior to the operation. How this can be\nhas puzzled a lot of people (Hurley 1998). Even more interesting for\nour purposes, however, is that, under certain laboratory conditions,\nthese patients seem to behave as though two \u2018centres of\nconsciousness\u2019 have been created in them. The original unity\nseems to be gone and two centres of unified consciousness seem to have\nreplaced it, each associated with one of the two cerebral\nhemispheres.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of the kinds of behaviour that prompt\nthat assessment. The human retina is split vertically in such a way\nthat the left half of each retina is primarily hooked up to the left\nhemisphere of the brain and the right half of each retina is primarily\nhooked up to the right hemisphere of the brain. Now suppose that we\nflash the word TAXABLE on a screen in front of a brain bisected\npatient in such a way that the letters TAX hit the left side of the\nretina, the letters ABLE the right side, and we put measures in place\nto ensure that the information hitting each half of the retina goes\nonly to one lobe and is not fed to the other. If such a patient is\nasked what word is being shown, the mouth, controlled usually by the\nleft hemisphere, will say TAX while the hand controlled by the\nhemisphere that does not control the mouth (usually the left hand and\nthe right hemisphere) will write ABLE. Or, if the hemisphere that\ncontrols a hand (usually the left hand) but not speech is asked to do\narithmetic in a way that does not penetrate to the hemisphere that\ncontrols speech and the hands are shielded from the eyes, the mouth\nwill insist that it is not doing arithmetic, has not even thought of\narithmetic today, and so on\u2014while the appropriate hand is busily\ndoing arithmetic! \n\nRecently, this standard assessment has been challenged. In his\nimportant 2010 book and other publications, Tim Bayne suggests that\nthere are not two centres of consciousness. There is just one. What\nexplains the appearance of duality is that this single centre of\nconsciousness switches in the material of which it is consciousness\nfrom one hemisphere to the other. He calls this the switch model\n(2010: chs 8.4 and 9.5). To so much as get this approach off the\nground, it is crucial that that there be little or no evidence of a\ncentre of consciousness that is conscious of, say, A, B,\nand C but not D, E, and F and at the same\ntime of a centre of consciousness that is conscious of D,\nE, and F but not A, B, C. What we\njust called the standard assessment starts from a belief that there is\nlots of such evidence. Bayne disagrees. We will return to\nBayne\u2019s view in\n Section 4.2.\n\nBecause brain bisection operations have attracted so much attention\noutside of psychiatry and neurology, we have included references to\nsome of the more important writings. We will not do so for the rest of\nthe disorders we will introduce. For fuller accounts and references,\nconsult a general textbook of psychiatry. Here we are interested in\nthem only for the vicissitudes of unified consciousness that they\ndisplay, or might be thought to display.\n4.1.2 Mirror Twins\n\nIn addition to cases in which one body may have two centres of unified\nconsciousness, there are cases in which one centre of unified\nconsciousness may span two bodies. Mirror twins sometimes have such an\nappearance. Mirror twins are biologically identical twins where each\nbody mirrors the other. They dress exactly the same, finish each\nother\u2019s sentences, do tasks together whenever possible (if an\negg is being cooked, both right hands will hold the handle of the\nfrying pan), and so on. Brain bisection cases are putative examples of\nthe number of centres of consciousness not lining up with the number\nof brains and bodies from one direction. Mirror twins might be an\nexample from the opposite direction. In connection with unified\nconsciousness, this possibility is interesting.\n\nThe best-known case is the case of Greta and Freda Chaplin, who came\nto light in the U.K. in the 1970s. Two bodies were involved but the\nbodies acted in ways that would have been compatible, at least, with a\nsingle instance of unified consciousness spanning them. Each body\ncould finish complicated and unpredictable sentences started by the\nother. The two did everything they could together. When separated by\nmore than a few metres, they complained bitterly, each body reporting\nthat it felt like a part of itself was being ripped out. And so on. No\nprofessional discussion of the case has been found, unfortunately, but\nit was widely reported in the press at the time, for example in\nTime, Apr. 6, 1981.\n4.1.3 Hemi-neglect and Anosognosia\n\nIn hemi-neglect, one loses all sense of one side of one\u2019s body\nor sometimes one half (divided vertically) of everything spatial in\none\u2019s experience. Whatever is going on in hemi-neglect, unified\nconsciousness seems to remain. It is just that its \u2018range\u2019\nhas been bizarrely circumscribed. It encompasses an experience of only\nhalf the body or half of objects seen, not of the whole body or whole\nobjects. Where we expect perception and proprioception of the whole\nbody and whole objects, these patients perceive and propriocept only\none-half of the body and/or objects in general. So hemi-neglect is\nanother phenomenon in which there may be a major change in the\nphenomena over which unified consciousness without unified\nconsciousness itself being degraded. \n\nAnother phenomena in which unified consciousness seems to remain but\nwith a bizarrely circumscribed range is anosognosia. In this\ncondition, a person who has suffered loss of function (often as a\nresult of a stroke) is unaware of the deficits (Gennaro 2015a). Thus,\na person now blind will insist that she can see\u2014and will stumble\nabout in a room bumping into things. A person whose limbs are now\nparalysed will insist that his limbs are moving\u2014and will become\nfurious when family and caregivers say that they are not. And so on.\n\n4.1.4 Dissociative Identity Disorder\n\nAnother candidate phenomenon is what used to be called Multiple\nPersonality Disorder, now, more neutrally, Dissociative Identity\nDisorder (DID). Everything about this phenomenon is controversial,\nincluding whether there is any real multiplicity of\nconsciousness at all (Hacking 1995; Dennett 1998a). DID can take\ntwo forms. The more common form is often described as the units\n(persons, personalities, sides of a single personality, or whatever\none decides to call them) \u2018taking turns\u2019, usually with\npronounced changes in personality. When one is active, the other(s)\nusually is(are) not. Here the most prominent symptom is usually\nstrange memory gaps (amnesias) in each \u2018unit\u2019 for periods\nwhen the body in question was clearly conscious and active. In the\nother, less common form, both \u2018units\u2019 are present at the\nsame time. Here, for example, the unit in control of speech will\nreport that another \u2018person\u2019 inside her is, say, giving\nher orders, these orders being experienced not from the standpoint of\ngiving them but as coming from another person. This form of DID is\ncalled the co-conscious form in the literature but the term names\nsomething very different here from what James, Parfit and the like had\nin mind when they used the term. Among other things, me and the\n\u2018little person inside me\u2019 are not unified in one\nconsciousness. In fact, sometimes the dissociation in both forms of\nDID is behaviourally as complete as it is in brain bisection patients\nin the lab. \n4.1.5 Schizophrenia\n\nIn some particularly severe forms of schizophrenia, the victim seems\nto lose the ability to have an integrated, interrelated experience of\nhis or her world and self altogether. The person speaks in \u2018word\nsalads\u2019 that never get anywhere, indeed sometimes never become\ncomplete sentences. The person is unable to put together perceptions,\nbeliefs and motives into even simple plans of action or act on such\nplans if formed, even plans to obtain sustenance, tend to bodily\nneeds, escape painful irritants, and so on. Here, it is plausible to\nsuggest that the unity of consciousness has shattered rather than\nsplit. The behaviour of these people seems to express what we might\ncall mere experience-fragments, the contents of which are so narrow\nand unintegrated that the subject is unable to cope with daily life\nand interact with others in the ways that, for example, split brain\nsubjects can.\n4.1.6 Dysexecutive Syndrome\n\nIn schizophrenia of the severe sort just described, the shattering of\nconsciousness is part of a general breakdown or deformation of mental\nfunctioning: affect, desire, belief, even memory all suffer massive\ndistortions. In another kind of case, the normal unity of\nconsciousness seems to be just as absent but there does not seem to be\nthe same sort of general cognitive or affective disturbance. This is\ntrue of what some researchers call dysexecutive syndrome (Dawson,\n1998: 215, for example). What indicates breakdown in the unity of\nconsciousness is that these subjects are unable to consider two things\ntogether, even things directly related to one another. For example,\nsuch people cannot figure out whether a piece of a puzzle fits into a\ncertain place even when the piece and the puzzle are both clearly\nvisible and the piece obviously fits. They cannot crack an egg into a\npan. And so on.\n\nTrevarthen (1984) reports a similar syndrome in a few patients. In the\ncases he reports, commissurotomy patients are conscious of some object\nseen in the right side of the visual field by the left hemisphere\n(controlled so that the information is received by only that\nhemisphere) until an intention is formed to reach for it with the left\nhand, controlled by the right hemisphere. Somehow the intention to\nreach for it seems to obliterate consciousness of it in the hemisphere\nthat controls speech, presumably the left hemisphere. However, if the\nobject is slid over to the left visual field, then the\nspeech-controlling hemisphere reports that it can see the object\nagain\u2014even though the object can now be seen only by the right\nhemisphere and the left still controls speech!\n4.1.7 Simultagnosia\n\nA disorder presenting similar symptoms is simultagnosia or\nBalint\u2019s syndrome (Balint was an early 20th century German\nneurologist). In this disorder, patients see only one object located\nat one \u2018place\u2019 in the visual field at a time. Outside of a\nfew degrees of arc in the visual field, these patients say they see\nnothing but an \u201cundifferentiated mess\u201d and seem to be\nreceiving no information about objects (Hardcastle 1997: 62). \n\nWhat is common to dysexecutive disorder, Trevarthen\u2019s cases, and\nsimultagnosia is that subjects seem not to be conscious of even two\nobjects in a single conscious state. They cannot, for example, compare\nthe objects (in Trevarthen\u2019s cases, the object of a perception\nwith the object of an intention). Unlike commissurotomy cases, it is\nnot the case that a conscious experience of the second item exists\nwithin another unified consciousness. If there is any experience of\nthe second item at all, it is not conscious. Rather than consciousness\nbeing split into two discrete parcels, there is just one diminished\nparcel. The rest of the conscious experiencing that is typical of\nnormal consciousness has disappeared. \n\nThere are of course many different theories about what is going on in\nthe conditions we have just sketched, severe schizophrenia,\ndysexecutive syndrome, simultagnosia/Balint\u2019s syndrome. Some\nhold that the deficits are not in unified consciousness at all; they\nare in the capacity to process perceptual information. On this view,\nconsciousness remains unified but patients can no longer can take in\nwhat is happening. Here we will explore only the idea that the problem\nis with unified consciousness. If it is even possible that this is\nwhere the problem is, we can learn interesting things about the unify\nof consciousness. \n\nMany of the disorders that we have considered are fairly directly a\nresult of changes to the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is the study of\nthe relationship between the two. The best-known objects of such study\nin connection with unified consciousness are brain bisection\noperations (commissurotomies). Other neuroscientific studies relevant\nto unified consciousness have examined blindsight (Weiskrantz 1986),\nblindsight with visual agnosia (van Gulick 1994), hallucinations and\nthought insertion (Stephens & Graham 2000), and archaic hand\nsyndrome and delusions of control in schizophrenia (Mylopoulos 2015).\n\n4.2 Do the Conditions have a Common Structure?\n\nCan a single structure account for what is going on in all these\nphenomena? The Kantian taxonomy of forms of unified consciousness\nconsidered in\n Section 2.2\n can give us a way into this issue. \n\nAs we said earlier, one natural way to think of the conditions just\nsketched is to break them into two groups. In one group, however\ndrastic the change in unified consciousness, unified consciousness\nremains in a largely complete form. Arguably, this group would include\nbrain bisection cases, hemi-neglect, anosognosia, and DID. In the\nsecond group, schizophrenia of the severe kind we sketched,\ndysexecutive disorder, and simultagnosia, it is more natural to think\nthat unified consciousness has been damaged or even destroyed. \n\nBrain bisection cases first. On the standard way of conceptualizing\nthese cases, the key evidence for a duality of some kind is that there\nappear to be situations in which whatever is conscious of some items\nbeing experienced in the body in question is not conscious of other\nitems being experienced in that same body at the same time. We looked\nat two examples of the phenomenon in\n Section 4.1,\n the word TAXABLE and the doing of arithmetic. With respect to these\nexperienced items, there is a significant and systematically\nextendable situation in which to be conscious of some of these items\nis not to be conscious of others of them in a single unified\nconsciousness where we would expect such consciousness. If so, brain\nbisection patients fail to meet the conditions for unified\nconsciousness of contents. This seems to be what motivates the\njudgment that these patients have two centres of consciousness. \n\nLet us describe the case a bit more precisely. On the standard\naccount, a brain bisection patient could be conscious that both TAX\nand ABLE are being seen. But nothing in the patient would be conscious\nthat both items are being seen on the basis of seeing them.\nFor at least one of the two items, one of the two centres of\nconsciousness could have only the same kind of behavioural and other\n\u2018outside\u2019 evidence that any observer of the situation\ncould have. \n\nIndeed, the apparent split runs still deeper. Between the two\nhemispheres there seems to be a split in unified consciousness of\nexperiencing, too: Consciousness of doing some experiencing\ngoes with lack of consciousness of doing other experiencing that is\ngoing on in the same body. To use a useful metaphor first coined, so\nfar as we know, by Shoemaker, something is not conscious of acts of\nexperiencing going on in its body \u2018from the inside\u2019, i.e.,\non the basis of doing them, while something else is conscious\nof them on this basis. There seems to be a split in unified\nconsciousness of self, too: Consciousness of oneself as\nsubject on the basis of doing acts of experiencing in that body goes\nwith lack of consciousness of oneself as subject on the basis of other\nacts of experiencing being done in that body. If so, for many\nconscious states in these patients, there two instances of\n joint consciousness (section 2.1.3),\n not the normal one.\n\nTo be sure, this assessment is not universally accepted. As we saw,\nBayne and Chalmers (2003) and Bayne (2010: ch. 9) urge that while\naccess unity is split in these patients, phenomenal unity need not be.\nWhy not? Because there may be no duality of unified consciousness at\nany given time. Rather, a single instance of unified consciousness may\nbe switching back and forth between the material in the two\nhemispheres. As Schechter (2012) has urged, evidence of a simultaneous\nduality of consciousness would be a major problem for this\napproach. We will not attempt to assess the relevant evidence here\n(see Brook 2015 for further discussion). Even if Bayne is right, that\nshould not affect the prospects of a unified account of disorders of\nunified consciousness\u2014what is going on in brain bisection cases\nwould not be a disorder of unified consciousness! \n\nNext, dissociative identity disorder (DID). (We will take up\nhemi-neglect and anosognosia shortly.) In cases of DID, a central\nfeature is either some pattern of reciprocal amnesia or a strong sense\nthat another is inside (and yet still separate). This again seems to\nbe a situation in which being conscious of some experienced objects by\nhaving the experience goes with not being conscious of others in the\nsame body in the same way. The main difference is that the breach\nseems to be at a time in brain bisection cases, but can be either\nacross time or at a time in DID cases. If so, the breakdown in unity\nwill again consist in breakdowns of joint consciousness. The amnesia\nin diachronic DID has this character, clearly (and, except for the\namnesia, is in line with Bayne\u2019s (2010) switch model), but so\ndoes synchronic DID. The person and the \u2018little person\ninside\u2019 have no access from the inside to each other, so no\ncommon unified consciousness of experiencing, and the objects of their\nexperience are not unified, so no common unified consciousness of\ncontents. \n\nNow the second group. For severe schizophrenia, dysexecutive syndrome,\nand simultagnosia/Balint\u2019s syndrome\u2014the cases where\nconsciousness seems to be more shattered than split\u2014the\ndistinction of Kant\u2019s that we introduced in\n Section 2.2\n between two kinds of synthesis is useful. As we saw, Kant\ndistinguishes between the synthesis that gives us consciousness of\nindividual objects (Tye\u2019s object unity) and the synthesis that\ngives us consciousness of a number of objects at the same time. \n\nThis distinction seems to shed some interesting light on the three\nphenomena. The evidence suggests that the first kind of synthesis\ncontinues to be available to dysexecutive and simultagnosia patients:\nthey continue to be conscious of individual objects, events, etc. The\ndamage seems to be with respect to the second kind, being conscious of\nmultiple objects in a single act of consciousness. These people seem\nto achieve some measure of unified focal attention with respect to\nindividual objects but unified consciousness of multiple objects is\neither restricted or missing.\n\nWith the severe forms of schizophrenia that we sketched, patients may\nlack even the ability to perform the first kind of synthesis. In a\ndifferent jargon, these people may lack even the capacity for object\nconstancy. \n\nOn this analysis, hemi-neglect and anosognosia are a bit different\nfrom the other conditions. Here there is no apparent breach of joint\nconsciousness. Neither a split nor a breakdown in unified\nconsciousness is evident. Rather, in both conditions, there appears to\nbe a shrinking of the array of phenomena over which otherwise intact\njoint consciousness can range. Half of one\u2019s body and/or half of\nall perceived objects are excluded in the first condition, the actual\nsituation with respect to sight, limbs, etc., in the second. \n\nTo sum up, it appears that there is some prospect of placing all the\nconditions we have considered within a single structure of (Kantian)\ndistinctions, first between unified consciousness of contents and\nunified consciousness of experiencing, then between conscious\nexperience of individual objects and unified conscious experience of\nmultiple objects. Thought insertion might pose a problem for this\nscheme. Patients experience thought insertion when they believe that\nsome of their thoughts, experiences, emotions, and so on are not their\nown and have been \u2018inserted\u2019 into them from without.\nPeople suffering it are still aware of the \u2018alien\u2019\nthoughts from the point of view of having them. The deficit is in\nsomething to do with thinking of these thoughts as unified with the\nrest of conscious life. Normally, we think of ourselves as the subject\nand agent of all our experiences. In thought insertion, the victim\ndoes not appear to himself to be either subject or agent of some of\nthe experiences of which he is in fact the subject and agent\n(Mylopoulos 2015).\n5. Unity Across Time\n\nUnified consciousness at a given time (synchronic unity) has mainly\nbeen our topic so far. We now turn, more briefly, to unified\nconsciousness over time (diachronic unity). As was noted as long ago\nas Kant, unity across time is required even for such rudimentary\nmental operations as counting (1781: A103); indeed, unity across time\nis crucial for virtually all cognition of any complexity. Now,\nunification in consciousness might not be the only way to\nunite earlier cognitive states (earlier thoughts, earlier experiences)\nwith current ones but it is certainly a central way and the one best\nknown to us. \n5.1 Retention and Memory\n\nIn its synchronic form, we have suggested that a natural way to think\nof unified consciousness is in terms of joint consciousness.\nDiachronically, unified consciousness has an additional feature; it\nrequires retention over time, specifically, retention of earlier\nexperienced contents as one experienced them. What the retention\ncrucial to diachronic unity consists in is a matter of some interest.\nIt is tempting to assume that it is a kind of memory. However, as\nHusserl already told us, there is reason to be sceptical of this\napproach. There is a difference between experiencing a\nsuccession from time 1 to time 2 and merely remembering\nexperiencing what happened at time 1 while experiencing something at\ntime 2. Dainton captures Husserl\u2019s point by noting the\ndifference between \u201cimmediate and represented\nexperience\u2014remembering or imagining hearing a tone is not the\nsame as directly experiencing the tone\u201d (Dainton 2005: 155;\nDainton cites Husserl 1928).\n\nKelly (2005) raises a similar question. Suppose that one is listening\nto a melody. It has five notes and the final note is just being\nplayed. If one simply recollected the earlier notes, one should\nexperience a chord, not five notes spread out and related to one\nanother in time. Somehow, the earlier notes come\n\u2018date-stamped\u2019 but still available to be integrated with\nthe current experience in a single, temporally-extended, unified\nexperience. Whatever this process is like, it is clearly vital to our\nkind of unified consciousness. Without it, one could not hear any\nsequence as a sequence or so much as read a simple sentence. Though\nsome theorists call this across-time process unity of consciousness, a\nmore distinctive name for it would be the continuity of\nconsciousness.\n\nThis sort of continuity of consciousness can span very short durations\n(such as the \u2018specious present\u2019). Even a seemingly simple,\ncurrent experience is in fact a continuous experience of more than one\ninstant, and must be if one is to hear a sound or perceive\n(as opposed to remember) any temporally stretched phenomenon. How can\none have a unified conscious experience (not just a memory) of\nduration?\n\nHere again the debate that we mentioned earlier over whether a unified\nconscious experience is one experience or an assembly of many\nexperiences rears its head. Dainton (2005: chs. 5\u20137) takes a\ncontinuous, unified experience to include co-conscious experiences as\nparts. Tye (2003: ch. 4) urges instead that a diachronically unified\nexperience has multiple contents but no experiences as parts.\n5.2 Unity and Personal Identity\n\nIn the history of European philosophy at least since Locke, diachronic\nunified consciousness has been closely linked to personal identity in\nthe philosopher\u2019s sense, i.e., continuing to be a single person,\none and the same person, across time. (The point of the restriction to\nphilosophy is that clinical psychologists use the term quite\ndifferently, as the name for certain aspects of personality and\n\u2018self-conception\u2019.) Whatever may be true of the kind of\ndiachronic unity we just discussed, the kind of diachronic unity\nassociated with personal identity is clearly a kind of memory,\nspecifically, a kind of autobiographical memory. At least since Locke,\nphilosophers have argued that as far back as unified consciousness\nvia the right kind of autobiographical memory extends, there\nextends the person, one and the same person over all this time. The\nright kind of autobiographical memory is memory of the having,\nfeeling, or doing of earlier experiences, emotions, actions, and so\non. As Locke has it, being the same person just is having the\n\u2018same consciousness\u2019. We must be careful here.\nThere is lots of autobiographical memory that is not memory from the\npoint of view of experiencing. A person can remember that so-and-so\nhappened to her without remembering the event, the experience of it,\nor anything else \u2018from the inside\u2019, to use\nShoemaker\u2019s useful metaphor again. Memory theorists\u2019\nstandard categories are not fine-grained enough for our purposes here.\n\n\nSome important philosophers have urged that memory-carried diachronic\nunity is not sufficient for being one person over time. Kant, for\nexample, argued for a dissociation here, in his famous critique of the\nthird paralogism. In Kant\u2019s view, continuity sufficient to\n\u201cretain the thought of the previous subject and so hand it over\nto the subsequent subject\u201d (1781: A363), continuity sufficient\ntherefore for diachronic unity of consciousness, is quite compatible\nwith the \u2018retained thoughts\u2019 being passed from one subject\nto another, compatible therefore with an utter absence of personal\nidentity. If so, diachronic unity is not sufficient for personal\nidentity (Brook 1994: ch. 8). (Note: Locke and Kant may be less far\napart than this brief discussion would suggest. We are merely using\nthem to illustrate the two positions, not discussing either of them\nfully.) \n\nPhenomena relevant to identity in things other than persons can be a\nmatter of degree. This is well illustrated by the famous ship of\nTheseus. Suppose that over the years, a certain ship was rebuilt,\nboard by board, until every bit of it has been replaced. Is the ship\nat the end of the process the ship that started the process? Now\nsuppose that we take all those rotten, replaced boards and reassemble\nthem into a ship. Is this ship the original ship? It seems\nthat there is no determinate answer to these questions. Say what you\nlike, and what you like may vary depending on whether you are an\ninsurance adjuster or a history buff. Many philosophers have insisted\nthat such indeterminacy can never be the case for persons. Identity in\npersons is always completely unambiguous, not something that could\never be a matter of degree (Bishop Joseph Butler [1736] is a\nwell-known example). \n\nBrain bisection cases (described in\n Section 4.1)\n in which, some urge, unified consciousness splits in two may be\nrelevant here (Parfit 1971, 1984). As Parfit argues, the possibility\nof persons (or at any rate minds) splitting and re-fusing puts real\npressure on intuitions about our specialness. Perhaps the continuity\nof persons can be just as tangled and just as much a matter of degree\nas the continuity of any other middle-sized object. \n\nTwo final comments. Nagel (1971) argues that there can be\nindeterminacy in synchronic unity, too (see\n Section 6). One can sympathize\nwith Parfit about diachronic unity and yet have reservations about\nNagel on synchronic unity. Likewise, one should distinguish the\nquestion of whether diachronic unity can be intransitive from the\nquestion discussed in\n Section 6\n of whether synchronic unity can be intransitive.\n6. Two Philosophical Questions\n\nPhilosophers have made some fairly exotic claims about brain bisection\ncases and related conditions. Here we will consider two of them. \n6.1 No Whole Number of Centres of Consciousness\n\nThe first is a claim that in brain bisection patients, there is no\nwhole number of persons. So far, we have talked as though in brain\nbisection we always end up with some clear number of instances of\nunified consciousness. Nagel (1971), one of the early philosophers to\nwrite about these cases, rejects that view. For him, there is no whole\nnumber of \u2018centres of consciousness\u2019 in brain bisection\npatients: there is too much unity (for example in life outside the\nlaboratory and even in behaviour within) to say \u201ctwo\u201d, yet\ntoo much separation in the specially contrived laboratory situations\nto say \u201cone\u201d. \n\nNot being happy with so counterintuitive a result, philosophers have\nresponded. A response favoured by many is this. For any\nprecise \u2018one or two?\u2019 question, there will be a\nprecise answer. Behavioural control system? One. Groups of experienced\nobjects unified in consciousness? Two. And so on. If so, while the\none\u2019s and the two\u2019s wouldn\u2019t line up as tidily as\nthey do most of the time in people who have not had this operation, it\nis not obvious that the mixed answers support Nagel\u2019s conclusion\nthat there may be no whole number of centres of consciousness in these\npatients.\n6.2 Partial Unity is Possible\n\nThe \u2018in some respects one, in some respects two\u2019\npossibility at the centre of Nagel\u2019s analysis is related to a\nquestion about transitivity. Is it possible, for a given instance of\nexperienced objects p, q, and r, for there to be\nunified consciousness of p and q, unified consciousness\nof q and r, but no unified consciousness of p and\nr? (The parallel in brain bisection cases? Call the\n\u2018centres of consciousness\u2019 in the two cerebral lobes\nA and C, the older unilateral brain below them B.\nIs it possible for a mental state in A to be unified in\nconsciousness with one in B, one in B with one in\nC, and yet the state in A not to be unified with the\nstate in C?) \n\nHurley (1998) examines this question in detail, as does Bayne (2010:\nch. 9.4). Hurley comes at the question of transitivity by considering\nsome results reported by Sergent (1990). Since Sergent\u2019s work\nhas not been replicable, let us look instead at how the research by\nTrevarthen that we mentioned in\n Section 4.1.6\n throws up the same issue. In this research, as we said, brain\nbisection patients under certain conditions are conscious of some\nobject seen by, say, the right hemisphere until the left hand, which\nis controlled by the right hemisphere, reaches for it. Somehow the act\nof reaching for it seems to obliterate the consciousness of it. Very\nstrange\u2014how can something pop into and disappear from unified\nconsciousness in this way? This question leads Hurley to the notion of\npartial unity. Could two centres of consciousness, A\nand C, though not unified in consciousness with one another,\nnonetheless both be unified with some third thing, in this case the\nvolitional system B (the system of intentions, desires, etc.)?\nIf so, \u2018being unified with\u2019 is not a transitive\nrelationship\u2014A could be unified with B, and\nC could be unified with B, without A being\nunified with C. This idea is puzzling enough. Even more\npuzzling is how activation of the system B, with which both\nA and C are unified, could result in the loss of\nconsciousness in A and/or C of an object aimed at by\nB.\n\nHurley never pronounces on the possibility of partial unity. Instead,\nshe argues that none of the cases suspected of displaying it really\ndo. She accepts that intention can obliterate consciousness\u2014but\nthen distinguishes time periods (1998: 216). In Trevarthen\u2019s\ncases, for example, the situation with respect to unity is clear at\nany given moment\u2014one either is or is not conscious of the\nobject. The picture over time does not conform to our usual\nexpectations for diachronic singularity or transitivity of\nunity\u2014but that is simply an artefact of the cases, not a\nproblem. \n\nHurley considers another class of cases, what she calls Marcel\u2019s\n(1994) cases. Here subjects are asked to report the appearance of some\nitem in consciousness in three ways at the same time\u2014say, by\nblinking, pushing a button, and saying, \u2018I see it\u2019.\nRemarkably, in different trials each of these three acts are done\nwithout doing the other two. And the question is, What does this imply\nfor unified consciousness? In a case in which the subject pushes the\nbutton but neither blinks nor says anything, for example, is the\nhand-controller aware of the object while the blink-controller and the\nspeech-controller are not? How could the conscious system become\nfragmented in such a way?\n\nHurley\u2019s suggestion? They can\u2019t. What induces the\nappearance of incoherence about unity is the short time scale. Suppose\nthat it takes some time to achieve unified consciousness, perhaps\nbecause some complex feedback processes are involved. If so, then\nMarcel\u2019s cases have not got to a stable situation with respect\nto unity. The subjects were not given enough time (1998: 216).\n\nIs partial unity possible? To date, this remains an unanswered\nquestion, though Bayne (2010: 209) leans towards a negative\nanswer.\n\nHurley discusses more aspects of the unity of consciousness than\npartial unity. She argues, for example, that there is a normative\ndimension to unified consciousness\u2014conscious states have to\ncohere semantically for unified consciousness to result (we will\nreturn to this issue in\n Section 7.3).\n She discusses most of the kinds of breakdown phenomena that we\nconsidered earlier, exploring the implications of a wide range of\n\u2018experiments of nature\u2019 and laboratory experiments for the\npresence or absence of unified consciousness. In particular, she\nconsiders acallosal people (people born without a corpus callosum).\nEven though the corpus callosum, when present, is the chief channel of\ncommunication between the hemispheres, acallosal people show all the\nbehavioural signs of having fully unified consciousness. If so, then\nthe neurological and behavioural basis of unified consciousness would\nbe very different in different people. (We will return to this last\ntopic in\n Section 8.)\n7. Theories of Unity\n\nIn the literature, there is quite a range of theoretical claims about\nunified consciousness. We have looked at some of them. The first group\nconcerned diverging models: the subsumption, co-consciousness, single\nphenomenal content, and joint consciousness models and related\ntaxonomies. Then we looked at the unity thesis, claims about limits to\nand disorders of unified consciousness, claims about unity over time,\nand claims that there need not be a whole number of centres of\nconsciousness and that partial unity is possible. In\n Section 2,\n we said that we\u2019d return to the issue of whether unified\nexperiences has or does not have experiential parts (EP vs. NEP), the\nissue that underlays subsumption. EP and NEP are the topics of\nSections\n 7.1\n and\n 7.2.\n Near the end of\n Section 4,\n we said that we would return to the claim that unified consciousness\nrequires links among conscious contents. We will take up this issues\nin\n Section 7.3.\n Finally for this Section, we will examine a claim that we have not\ndiscussed so far, what is usually called the co-ownership thesis\n (Section 7.4)\n \n7.1 The Experiential Parts Theory\n\nHow is unified conscious experience structured? As we mentioned in\n Section 2.1,\n two incompatible models have some currency at the moment. On the\nexperiential parts view (EP), unified conscious experience includes\nsimpler experiences as parts or something like parts; unified\nconsciousness has a mereological aspect. On this view, when I have a\nunified experience of a pain and a noise, this unified experience\nincludes an experience of just the pain, and an experience of just the\nnoise. These simpler experiences are the relata of unified\nconsciousness; they are joined as parts of the unified experience of\nthe pain and noise together. Experiences a and b are\nunited in a third experience, c, which is their joint\noccurrence. On the no experiential parts (NEP) account, the conscious\nmental act through which diverse contents are presented does not have\nother conscious states, experiences, as parts. On the first view, when\nI have unified consciousness of experiencing, I am conscious of many\nexperiences. On the second view, I am conscious of just one\nexperience.\n\nTo clarify the two, let us use the notation \u2018\\(E(o_1)\\)\u2019\nfor an experience that is the conscious experience of just the\nintentional object \\(o_{1}\\). A conscious experience of just \\(o_{2}\\)\nis \\(E(o_{2})\\). What is the nature of an experience that takes the\nbigger content in which \\(o_{1}\\) and \\(o_{2}\\) are presented\ntogether? On NEP, it has the structure of \\(E(o_{1}, o_{2})\\), where\nthis introduces a single experience that has both contents as its\nobject. To be conscious of \\(o_{1}\\) by means of this experience is to\nbe conscious of it with \\(o_{2}\\). (See the concept of joint\nconsciousness introduced in\n Section 2.1.3.)\n According to NEP, this is what the subject\u2019s conscious unity at\nthe time amounts to (if we oversimplify by supposing her to be\nconscious of nothing but \\(o_{1}\\) and \\(o_{2}\\)). No\n\u2018smaller\u2019 or simpler conscious states figure as parts.\nThis experience might be realized in a brain state that has parts, but\nthese parts are not further conscious states. By contrast, in EP\n\\(E(o_{1})\\) and \\(E(o_{2})\\) persist as parts of an encompassing\nexperience by means of which one is conscious of \\(o_{1}\\) and\n\\(o_{2}\\) together and unified consciousness would have the structure\n\\(E(E(o_{1}) E(o_{2}))\\). \n\nProponents of EP include Lockwood, Dainton, Shoemaker, and Bayne and\nChalmers, and Bayne by himself (in his 2010 book). As we saw in\n Section 2.2,\n theorists as otherwise different as Dainton, Lockwood, and Shoemaker\nuse the term \u2018co-consciousness\u2019 as the name for the\nrelationship that ties the experiential parts together. Not only are\nmost versions of EP built on some notion of co-consciousness; most\nnotions of co-consciousness assume EP and are incompatible with NEP.\n\n\nEP faces a difficulty. James describes the problem in his example of\nthe twelve-word sentence. Suppose each word in the sentence is known\nby just one of twelve people. It is hard to see, James says, how these\ntwelve thoughts could be combined to yield a unified consciousness of\nthe sentence. As he says,\n\n\nTake a sentence of a dozen words, take twelve men, and to each one\nword. Then stand the men in a row or jam them in a bunch, and let each\nthink of his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be a\nconsciousness of the whole sentence. (James 1890: 160) \n\n\nWhat EP needs is a way of combining experiences that does not simply\nconjoin them into an experiential aggregate, for a mere combination of\nexperiences is not the experience of a combination. EP needs, then, a\nway of putting together experiences that also puts together their\ncontents. Without any specification of how this combining of contents\nis to be achieved, we are left with a mere aggregate of experiences,\neach member of which is oblivious to the contents of the other states\nin the aggregate. As James puts it, \u201cIdea of a + idea of\nb is not identical with idea of (\\(a + b\\))\u201d (1890:\n161).\n\nProponents of EP may reply that they never intended to give an\naccount of conscious unity. Instead, EP should be taken to\nprovide a description of the structure of unified conscious\nstates. In other words, it is a characterization, not an explanation,\nof such states and how they are individuated. It may be held that the\nonly good way to individuate conscious states is on the basis of\ncontents. Hence, since one is aware of many contents via a conscious\nstate, that state must itself consist of several simpler conscious\nstates that have (somehow) come to be unified. At the very least,\nthen, those who advocate NEP owe us an alternative basis for\nindividuating conscious states. We will return to this issue in the\nnext section.\n\nAs we saw, the notion of a unified experience subsuming simpler\nexperiences is central to Bayne\u2019s and Chalmers\u2019 (2003; see\nBayne 2010) account of the unity of consciousness. This may appear to\nbe a version of EP and Tye treats it so (without using that label;\n2003: 21). However, Bayne and Chalmers hedge their bet. While they do\nspeak of the encompassing conscious state as involving \u201cat least\na conjunction of each of many more specific conscious states\u201d\n(2003: 27), and of a \u201ccomplex phenomenal state and a simpler\nstate that is intuitively one of its \u2018components\u2019\u201d\n(2003: 40), they also caution that thinking here in terms of \u201ca\nmereological part/whole relation among phenomenal states\u201d should\nbe regarded only as an \u201caid to intuition rather than as a\nserious ontological proposal\u201d (2003: 40). So how their view\nstacks up with respect to EP is not entirely clear. \n7.2 The No Experiential Parts Theory\n\nSearle and Tye are leading current advocates of NEP. Searle ([2000]\n2002: 56) ventures that \u201cmaybe it is wrong to think of\nconsciousness as made up of parts at all\u201d. For one has a\n\u201csingle, unified, conscious field containing visual, auditory,\nand other aspects\u201d and \u201cthere is no such thing as a\nseparate visual consciousness\u201d ([2000] 2002: 55). Do\n\u201cvisual experiences stand to the whole field of consciousness in\nthe part-whole relation?\u201d ([2000] 2002: 54). No, says Searle\n(though he may do some backsliding later in the article). \n\nTye offers a similar view, which he dubs the \u2018one-experience\nview\u2019 (Tye 2003: ch. 1). Considering the polymodal nature of our\nexperience, he says, \u201cThere are not five different \u2026\nexperiences somehow combined together to produce a new unified\nexperience\u201d. Instead, \u201cthere is just one experience\nhere\u201d (2003: 27). \n\nPart of what is at stake in this dispute is how to individuate (how to\ncount) experiences. EP theorists think that experiences go one to an\nobject: if you experience two things, you have two experiences. Or\neven finer: if you experience one thing in two ways, you have had two\nexperiences. NEP theorists hold that some experiences can be\nindividuated differently; a unified act of conscious experiencing is a\nsingle experience, experientially non-composite, no matter how many\nobjects it has. \n\nSo what are the arguments for the two views like? Theorists who accept\nEP usually just assert or even assume it (we saw some examples of this\nin\n Section 7.1).\n The idea just seems intuitively plausible to its adherents and they\ntend not to argue for it. NEP is not intuitively obvious\u2014even\npeople such as Searle who advocate it can find themselves sliding into\nEP\u2014and its adherents do argue for it. \n\nJames was the first champion of NEP. He endorsed it in the course of\nrepudiating the \u2018mind-stuff theory\u2019, according to which\n\u201cour mental states are composite in structure, made up of\nsmaller states conjoined\u201d (1890: 145). Against this James says\nthat, while our experience is complex, this complexity is not a matter\nof there being several experiences (or\n\u2018feelings\u2019) present in an encompassing experience. This is\nbecause \u201cwe cannot mix feelings as such, though we may mix the\nobjects we feel, and from their mixture get new\nfeelings\u201d (1890: 157). If one\u2019s experience appears to\nbecome more complex, that is a matter of a single\nexperience\u2019s content being more complex, and is not the\naddition of more experiences (of the diverse contents).\nIndeed, he says, \u201cWe cannot even \u2026 have two feelings in\nmind at once\u201d (1890: 157).\n\nHere is how this is supposed to work. If we say that experiences\na and b are fused to form experience c, we should\ntreat \u2018fused\u2019 as referring to a process in which a\nand b are superseded by c, not included in it. A\nand b have been replaced by c, in which their contents\nare connected, and they (a and b) no longer exist. As\nJames put it, contrasting the unified consciousness of the whole\nalphabet with the several states involved in consciousness of each\nletter taken singly, \n\n\nIt is safer \u2026 to treat the consciousness of the alphabet as a\ntwenty-seventh fact, the substitute and not the sum of the\ntwenty-six simpler consciousnesses. (1909: 189) \n\n\nThis view clearly avoids the problem of how to combine experiences\nthat faces EP. \n\nSince James had a concept of co-consciousness and we have linked\nco-consciousness closely to EP, we should say a word about his\nconcept. It is not the same as the concept that we find in Parfit,\nLockwood, Hurley, Shoemaker et al. For James, co-consciousness relates\nonly to a multiplicity of items of which one is conscious. In unified\nconscious experience of them, there is no multiplicity of conscious\nstates to enter into a \u2018co\u2019-relationship. Indeed, the\ncontents are made co-conscious by being presented together in a\nsingle, noncomposite experience. \n\nWe will close this discussion with two notes about the relationship of\nthe dispute between EP and NEP to the transparency thesis that we\ndiscussed earlier. This is the thesis that we are not directly\nconscious of our own experiences. (\u2018Transparent\u2019 here\nmeans that while I am conscious via conscious states, I am\nnot conscious of them. I \u2018see through\u2019 them, as\nit were; hence \u2018transparency\u2019.) First, all claims for both\nEP and NEP that we have considered would seem to go through even if\nthe transparency thesis were true. So transparency would not undermine\nthis debate. Secondly, even Tye (2003), who accepts both NEP and\ntransparency, also accepts that NEP does not require or\nentail transparency. Rather, he seems to think that the\ntransparency thesis is true and, since it is true, this constrains\nwhat could be unified in phenomenal unit. Accepting the constraint, he\nhas to say that, \u201cPhenomenal unity is a relation between\nqualities represented in experience, not between qualities\nof experiences\u201d (Tye 2003: 36), however unintuitive\nthis claim may be. Certainly there are approaches that can both accept\nNEP and reject transparency. That is true, for example, of those who\nhold that conscious states are self-representing states, states of\nwhich one becomes conscious just by having them. These theorists will\nhold that one can be directly conscious of one\u2019s own\nconscious states, yet they could still hold that states of unified\nconsciousness have an NEP structure. \n7.3 The Internal Links Theory\n\nNow we turn to the idea that unified consciousness of contents and\nexperiencing requires some kind of phenomenally evident relation among\nthe contents of the unified conscious state (in addition to the\ncontents being aspects of a single unified act of consciousness) and\nsome attempts to model this relationship. We might call this the\nrelational model of unified consciousness. It is a descendant\nof Kant\u2019s claim examined in\n Section 1\n that unified consciousness requires conceptual interconnectedness in\nthe objects of consciousness; as he put it, \n\n\nall appearances stand in a thoroughgoing connection according to\nnecessary laws, and hence stand in a transcendental affinity\nof which the empirical affinity is the mere consequence. (1781/1787:\nA113\u2013114) \n\n\nKant\u2019s argument for this claim seems to have been that synthesis\nof represented objects to produce a single complex object is a\nnecessary condition of consciousness of self as single common subject.\nWithout represented objects being tied together in a single complex\nobject, one might be aware of the subject of an individual\nrepresentation but one could not be aware of the subject of one such\nrepresentation as the subject of other such representations. Rather, I\nshould have \u201cas many-coloured and diverse a self as I have\nrepresentations of which I am conscious ..\u201d. (B134)\u2014as are\nin fact had by me, for I would not, of course, be aware that it was\nme. \n\nOne recent expression of the idea is Hurley\u2019s (1998) claim that\nconscious states must satisfy a normative requirement if unified\nconsciousness is to result. Specifically, they must \u2018cohere\nsemantically\u2019. (It is not entirely clear that satisfying this\nnormative requirement requires that the contents of consciousness be\nlinked in the way that Kant urged.) Even more recently, Revonsuo\n(2003) has urged that phenomenal contents must be situated in the same\n\u2018phenomenal space\u2019 in order to be unified, adding,\n\u201cI am inclined to treat phenomeno-spatiality as the basic\nunifying feature of human consciousness\u201d.\n\nFor theorists of this persuasion, these phenomenally evident spatial,\ncausal, etc., relations among contents explain why my perceptual\nstates typically present one coherent world in which, for instance, a\nwall in front of me and starting at one end of my visual field will\ncontinue across that field. Are such connections among the contents of\nan experience necessary for their being presented together in\nexperience? Some recent theorists have argued that they are not (Bayne\n2004; Brook 2005). One can have unified consciousness of a siren that\nthat one is hearing, an average grade that one is calculating, and a\nfictitious landscape that one is visualizing. In what possible way\ncould items as diverse as these have to be connected to one another?\nThey are not even all in space or contiguous to one another and they\nare certainly not causally interconnected, yet I can experience all\nthree in a single act of unified consciousness. \n\nDoesn\u2019t there have to be at least logical coherence among the\ncontents? As we just saw, Hurley (1998) makes this claim, as does\nBaars (1988). Hurley, for example, argues that we cannot believe\nmutually inconsistent things when we are conscious of both in a single\nunified experience. Could the disconnect among unified conscious\nstates extend to them actually being inconsistent with one another?\nContrary to Hurley and Baars, the evidence suggests that it could.\nSuppose that one sees a stick immersed in water as being bent but\nfeels it to be straight or knows that this is an illusion. Here,\none\u2019s conscious perception that it is bent conflicts with\none\u2019s conscious belief that it is not bent, yet these states are\nunified in one consciousness (Bayne 2000). Tye (2003: 38) does not\nconsider this illusion to be an example of incoherence. He holds that\nhere touch corrects vision, making the stick appear to be straight,\nand so belief renders the appearance mere appearance. That claim is\ncontroversial. Bayne (2004: 227) discusses another example, inverting\nspectacles, more plausibly. These glasses render one\u2019s visual\ncontents inconsistent with one\u2019s tactile contents, yet\nconsciousness of the visual contents remains unified with\nconsciousness of the tactile contents. \n\nIn fact, it would seem that there can be incompatibilities even within\na perceptual modality. Thus, Tye (2003: 38\u201339) notes that there\nare pictures that depict impossible situations. He also discusses the\nwaterfall effect, in which, after staring at a waterfall for some\ntime, if one looks at the adjacent rock face, a portion of the rock\nsurface will appear to be moving\u2014and not moving (relative to the\narea around it; not everyone accepts that both elements are\nsimultaneously present in the waterfall illusion; see Crane 1988).\nThese examples suggest that we can have unified consciousness of\npretty much any collection of items whatsoever, no matter how they are\nrelated to one another. Indeed, it is not easy to specify any relation\namong unified contents or acts of experiencing (beyond their being\nunified) that is required for them to be unified. If so,\nHurley\u2019s (1998) suggestion that meeting a normative requirement\nis necessary for unified consciousness, specifically, a requirement\nthat the experienced properties of things in unified consciousness\ncohere semantically, is in trouble. \n7.4 The Co-Ownership Theory\n\nFinally, there is a model that holds that unity of conscious states\nconsists in their ownership by a single subject, Bayne\u2019s (2004)\nco-ownership. Is co-ownership meant to be necessary, or sufficient, or\nboth? The idea that unified conscious experience must be had by a\nsingle subject could be trivially true, as it would be if the subject\nat a time is just defined as a set of unified contents. For the thesis\nto become interesting, advocates of it would have to offer a richer\nconception of the subject than that. On such a conception, the claim\nthat experiences are had by the same subject would involve\ntheir attribution to the same extra-phenomenal substrate or bearer of\nexperiences, one that can be individuated independently of what is to\nbe found in experience, and thus independently of the notion of a\nunified field of conscious contents. Stated thus, the thesis would not\nbe trivial and may well state a necessary condition of unified\nconsciousness.\n\nHowever, if co-ownership is necessary, is it also sufficient? It seems\nthat is is possible for items that are not unified with one\nanother to be simultaneously presented to one and the same subject.\nThis seems to happen, for example, in split brain cases, or fictional\nvariations thereof\u2014e.g., Parfit\u2019s example of a single\nsubject who is able simultaneously to try out two alternative\napproaches to solving a math problem (1984: 246\u2013248). This state\nof affairs would seem to be a case of parallel but nonunified\nsets of conscious states had by the same subject, in some\ngood sense of the term \u2018same subject\u2019. The same would seem\nto hold of the contents of a subject who switches back and forth\nbetween lobes who lacked memory of earlier contents. If so,\nco-ownership would appear not be sufficient for unity. A\nfortiori, co-ownership would appear not to capture what is\ndistinctive about unified consciousness. Put differently, if\nthere is a requirement here of any kind, more than co-ownership seems\nto be needed. The subject must have a certain kind of relationship to\nthe material. As Kant put it, the material must be something to the\nsubject (A116)\u2014and this requires a subject to whom things can be\nsomething. Mere ownership by itself would appear to fall short (Brook\n1994: 135\u20139, discusses these issues in connection with\nKant).\n\nThought insertion may pose another problem for the co-ownership\nthesis. In thought insertion, the alien states are unquestionably\nco-owned with the avowed ones but there seems to be less than full\nunity of consciousness.\n\nIn\n Section 5.2,\n we examined Kant\u2019s claim that instances of diachronic unified\nconsciousness are able to extend beyond one person (by any criterion\nfor being one person other than unified consciousness). If so,\ndiachronic unity is not sufficient for singleness of person. On the\nstandard account, brain bisection cases suggest roughly the reverse\nclaim about synchronic unity; where there seem to be two instances of\nunity in one body, by many criteria there is just one person\n(remember, there is no question about singleness of person outside the\nlaboratory). If so, singleness of person is not sufficient for\nsynchronic unity. \n8. Neural Architecture of Unified Consciousness\n\nWe will conclude this article with a brief look at some philosophical\nspeculations about what the neural architecture of unified\nconsciousness might or must be like. One of the hottest issues in\ncurrent consciousness research is the issue of how brains achieve\nconsciousness and what parts of the brain are most involved in doing\ndo, what the \u2018neural correlates of consciousness\u2019 (NCC)\nare. Any real insights into the NCCs of consciousness in general are\nalso likely to contain insights into the NCCs of unified\nconsciousness. This literature is now so vast that it would take a\nwhole additional article to discuss the topic. (Koch 2004 is an\nexcellent review of the empirical neuroscience and Chalmers 2000 is\nthe most extensive exploration of the conceptual issues to date.)\nBecause of space limitations, here we will restrict ourselves to three\nof the most influential philosophical approaches to what the neural\narchitecture of consciousness might be like, those of Paul and\nPatricia Churchland (see for example Paul Churchland 1995: 214),\nDaniel Dennett (1991), and Susan Hurley (1998). \n\nThe Churchlands\u2019 view flows from a radical picture of neural\narchitecture in general. They urge that the architecture of the\nprocesses underlying cognition and consciousness consists not of\ntransformations of symbolically encoded representations, as most\nphilosophers have believed, but of something like vector\ntransformations in phase spaces. Thus on their view, neural correlates\nof unified consciousness are nothing remotely symbol- or sentence-like.\n\nDennett articulates an even more radical view, on both unity and the\narchitecture of it. For him, unified consciousness of\n\u2018self\u2019 is simply a short-lasting \u2018virtual\ncaptain\u2019 coming to be as a result of a small group of\ninformation-parcels gaining temporary dominance in a struggle with\nother such groups for control of such cognitive activities as\nself-monitoring and self-reporting. We take these transient phenomena\nto be more than they are because each of them is the \u2018me\u2019\nof the moment and they are tied to earlier transient selves by the\nspecial form of autobiographical memory identified earlier. If the\ntemporary coalition of conscious states that is winning at the moment\nis what I am, is the self, each temporal chunk of \u2018self\u2019\nis likely to be found in different parts of the brain from other such\nchunks and there will be many NCCs of unified consciousness in many\ndifferent places.\n\nIf Dennett is right, there would be reason for scepticism about what\nHurley calls the isomorphism hypothesis. The isomorphism\nhypothesis is the idea that a given kind of change in consciousness\nwill always reflect, even be the result of, a given kind of change in\nthe brain. Hurley is sceptical about it, too. One way in which\nskepticism about this hypothesis arises in her work is via\nconsideration of acallosals (people born without a corpus callosum).\nEven though the corpus callosum, when present, is the chief channel of\ncommunication between the hemispheres, acallosal people show all the\nbehavioral signs of having fully unified consciousness. If so, it has\nto be achieved by mechanisms such as cuing activity that are utterly\ndifferent from communication though a corpus callosum. And the same\ncan be true the opposite way. Different changes in consciousness can\ngo with the same changes to structure and function in the brain. And\nif both these claims are correct, then the neurological/behavioral\nbasis of unified consciousness would be very different in different\npeople. The isomorphism hypothesis would be false, attractive though\nit has been to many people.\n\nDennett\u2019s and the Churchlands\u2019 views fit naturally within\na dynamic systems view of the neural implementation of cognition and\nconsciousness, the view that unified consciousness is a result of\ncertain self-organizing activities in the brain and interactions\nbetween brain and world. Dennett thinks that, given the nature of the\nbrain, which is nothing more than neurons sending and receiving\nsignals to and from other neurons, consciousness could not take any\nform other than something like a pandemonium of competing bits of\ncontent. The Churchlands don\u2019t agree with Dennett about this.\nThey see consciousness as a state of the brain, the\n\u2018wetware\u2019, not a result of information processing, of\n\u2018software\u2019. Both sides in this debate agree that it is\nunlikely that the processes that subserve unified consciousness are\nsentence-like or language-like. \n9. Conclusions\n\nA great deal of work has been done on the unity of consciousness in\nthe past few decades. Our introduction to it has been grouped around\nthe following themes: \n\nIn some form, the unity of consciousness is a pervasive,\ncognitively important feature of our kind of mind. \nEven phenomenal unity of consciousness at a time comes in a number\nof forms and consciousness is also unified across time. \nThe ways in which unified consciousness can break down raise\ninteresting questions about the phenomenon and throw important light\non its structure.\nThe topic connects to a number of important issues concerning the\nrelationship of consciousness to cognition, including whether unified\nconsciousness across time plays a role in personal identity (the\nphilosophers\u2019 concept of personal identity).\nAll the leading theories of the unity of consciousness face\nproblems.\nThe state of theorizing on the topic suggests that there is still\nmuch room for further work. \n\n",
