Monism and its rivals\n\n\nIn this context \u2018monism\u2019 is simply a label for the idea\nthat all works of art fall within one ontological category, such as\nabstract particulars. A prevalent argument against this sort of thesis\nrests on the distinction between performance and non-performance\nworks: many musical works can be performed by various persons and on\nvarious occasions; a painting cannot. Having described such\ndistinctions amongst works of art, Wolterstorff concludes tersely that\n\u201cWorks of art are not all alike in their ontological\nstatus\u201d (1975, 230). According to Stephen Davies (1993), we need\nnot look beyond the art of music to find grounds for rejecting\nontological monism. More recently, Robert Howell (2002a, 2002b) has\nargued that if the term \u2018work of art\u2019 covers artistic\nimprovisations, the various utterances referred to as \u2018oral\nliterature\u2019, and such items as paintings and scored musical\ncompositions, then no single adequate ontological category is to be\nfound. With reference to artists\u2019 stipulative authority over the\n\u201cfeatures and boundaries\u201d of their works, Sherri Irvin\ndeclares that \u201cAny claim to the effect that all works belong to\nthe same ontological category will thus come out false or\nuninformative\u201d (2008, 1). Yet as will become clear below, monism\nstill has its proponents.\n",
