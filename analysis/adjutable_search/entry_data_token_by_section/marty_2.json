    "main_text": "Language\n3. Language\n\nMarty\u2019s philosophy of language deserves our attention for at\nleast two reasons. First of all, while his predecessors and\ncontemporaries were for the most part concerned with the development\nof language through history, e.g. phonological and semantic change,\nMarty devoted much more attention to language as it is. In his own\nterms, his investigations concerning language were primarily\ndescriptive rather than genetic. In contemporary terms, his focus was\nsynchronic rather than diachronic. In this regard he was a precursor\nof structuralism (Kiesow 1990). The second reason why Marty\u2019s\nphilosophy of language is worth examining lies in the fact that in\ncontrast to many others, who approached language as a product of\neither an alleged supra-human intelligence or lower psychological and\nphysiological mechanisms such as association and reflex, he\ninvestigated language as something that arises from individual human\nminds as intentionally directed to objects. Not only does\nintentionality in the usual sense of consciousness of\nsomething become focal in Marty\u2019s philosophy of language; he is\nalso concerned first and foremost with language \u201cin the sense of\nthe purposeful manifestation of inner life through certain\nsigns, especially through sounds and in particular those which \u2013\nlike most words of our spoken languages \u2013 are not intrinsically\nintelligible, but owe their significant power to custom and\ntradition\u201d (Marty 1908a, 3). His emphasis here on purposeful\nmanifestation (absichtliche Kundgabe) not only involves\nintention in the sense of the speaker\u2019s communicative goal of\nevoking similar psychical phenomena as those expressed by linguistic\nsigns in the hearer, but is also intention in the narrow sense of\ndirectedness toward intentional contents of expressed psychical\nphenomena (Formigari 2004, 162ff.; Cesalli & Mulligan 2017, 259\nff.). In this regard Marty was a precursor of yet another later\nmovement in the study of language, namely intentional semantics\n(Liedtke 1990).\n\nAs already indicated, Marty conceives of philosophy just as Brentano\ndid, namely as a discipline involving psychological considerations in\nall of its branches, both theoretical and practical. Philosophy of\nlanguage is accordingly restricted by him to that domain of linguistic\ninquiry which is tied up with the science of mind or consciousness.\nThose areas of linguistics which can be investigated independently of\npsychology, e.g. phonology, are no part of philosophy of language. It\nis altogether unacceptable to Marty to regard philosophy of language\nas distinct from the science of language, as if they were two\nendeavors concerned with one and the same subject matter and yet\ndiffering in their methods (Marty 1908a: 4 f.). In this regard he\nnever swayed from Brentano\u2019s precept that the true method of\nphilosophy is no different from that of the natural sciences.\n\nThough Marty\u2019s psychological approach differs from that of many\nother philosophers of language in the late nineteenth century as well\nas the early twentieth, one of the reasons why his work has been\nneglected by philosophers lies in their turn away from psychological\nconsiderations, as this can already be seen in Husserl\u2019s\ncritique of \u201cpsychologism\u201d (Husserl 1900) and also in\nFrege\u2019s anti-psychologistic work on logic and language, which\nhas had an especially profound effect on a good many philosophers in\nthe twentieth century and into the present one. (As regards the\npossibility of related charges of \u201cmentalism\u201d and\n\u201cintrospectionism\u201d, see Rollinger 2008: 73\u201386.)\nDuring his lifetime he had already been under suspicion from the\nNeo-Kantian camp as a proponent of psychologism, though he vehemently\ninsisted that he did not succumb to such a tendency in any invidious\nsense such as the one formulated by Husserl (Marty 1908a, 6\u201318).\nAbove all, it must be remembered that for Husserl psychologism\nentailed relativism. Both Marty and Brentano pointed out that their\napplications of psychology in philosophy in no way involved relativism\n(Brentano 1925, 179\u2013183). In view of the fact that consciousness\nand specific cognitive operations, particularly with an interest in\nintentionality, have become thematic in recent decades, it seems to be\nquite in order to take a new look at Marty\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage as not entirely unrelated to the philosophical landscape of\nour times.\n",
