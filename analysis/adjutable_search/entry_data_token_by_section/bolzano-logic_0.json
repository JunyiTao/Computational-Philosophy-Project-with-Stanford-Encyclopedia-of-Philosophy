    "main_text": "Early work in logic and methodology\n1. Early work in logic and methodology\n\nIn 1810, Bolzano published a booklet entitled Contributions to a\nbetter founded presentation of mathematics (Bolzano 1810; Bolzano\n2004b) in which he developed his views about the unsatisfactory state\nof the mathematics of his time and the need for its reform. He\nproposed a new definition of mathematics as \u201cthe science which\ndeals with the general laws (forms) to which things must conform in\ntheir existence\u201d (Bolzano 1810, I, \u00a78; Bolzano 2004b: 94),\na new division of mathematics into universal mathematics (arithmetic,\nalgebra, analysis, and elements of his future theory of collections)\nand more specialized mathematical disciplines (e.g., the mathematical\ntheory of time, geometry, rational mechanics), and also put forth some\nconsiderations on logic. As with Leibniz, logic is again seen as\nclosely connected with mathematics: it is, indeed, the mathematical\nmethod (Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a71; Bolzano 2004b: 103).\n\nThe logical theory of the Contributions is quite primitive,\nbut the work nonetheless contains a number of important insights.\nFollowing Aristotle, Bolzano distinguished two sorts of proofs: those\nthat aim merely to convince us that something is the case and\nthose which also show why it is so. He called the former\n\u201ccertifications\u201d (Bolzano 2004b: 254:\n\u201cconfirmations\u201d) [Gewissmachungen], the latter\n\u201cgroundings\u201d [Begr\u00fcndungen]. The concept of\ngrounding reflects the \u201cobjective connection among\ntruths\u201d, which need not and usually does not coincide with the\nsubjective order of recognition. It would later become the fundamental\nconcept in Bolzano\u2019s treatment of axiomatic theories in the\nTS.\n\nHe then extended this distinction to cover other elements of axiomatic\ntheories. Subjectively, definitions are considerations that acquaint\nus with the meanings of certain words, while objectively, a definition\nindicates the parts and structure of a complex concept. Subjectively,\nsome words do not require definition, because their meanings are\nalready clearly understood, while objectively, some concepts cannot be\ndefined because they are simple, i.e., have no parts. Similarly, an\naxiom or principle in the subjective sense is a proposition whose\ntruth is evident to us, while in the objective sense an axiom is\nsimply an indemonstrable truth from which other truths may be\ndeduced.\n\nConsidered objectively, a mathematical theory itself becomes a\nmathematical object. It has an intrinsic structure, in which complex\nconcepts are ultimately composed of simple ones, and propositions are\nordered according to their relations of objective dependence,\nbeginning with the axioms. The goal of foundational research, as he\nthen saw things, is to discover and display this objective order\n(Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a7 2).\n\nThe Contributions also contains valuable epistemological\nreflections. Since axioms in the objective sense need not be evident\nto us, Bolzano states, it can and does happen that, at first anyway,\nwe find them less trustworthy than the theorems that are objectively\ndemonstrable from them. We become convinced of their truth not by\ncontemplating them in isolation, but rather by recognizing their role\nwithin a deductive system: that is, by seeing that their objective\nconsequences include the theorems we believe to be true but no\npropositions we take to be false (Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a721, note;\nBolzano 2004b: 119). Similarly, even though simple concepts cannot be\ndefined in an objective sense, they may still require definition in\nthe subjective sense, that is, we may need to develop a clear\nunderstanding of them. In such cases, our understanding\n\n\n\u2026 is brought about by mentioning several sentences, in which the\nconcept in question, designated by its own word, appears in various\ncombinations. From the comparison of these sentences, the reader is\nable to abstract which determinate concept the word designates.\n[\u2026] This means is well known as that by which each of us\nlearned the first meanings of words in our mother tongue (Bolzano\n1810, II, \u00a78; Bolzano 2004b: 107; our translation).\n\n\nBolzano called such circumlocutions \u201cparaphrases\u201d or\n\u201ccircumscriptions\u201d [Umschreibungen]. His method\npoints towards a solution of the paradox of definition according to\nwhich all concepts are ultimately defined in terms of simple concepts,\nbut these remain undefined and thus devoid of meaning.\n\nBolzano also presents two important criteria for the correctness of\nproofs: according to the first, \u201cIf the subject (or the\nhypothesis) of a proposition is as wide as it can be so that the\npredicate (or the thesis) can be applied to it, then in any correct\nproof of this proposition all characteristics of the subject must be\nused, i.e., they must be applied in the derivation of the\npredicate.\u201d The second is Bolzano\u2019s version of\nAristotle\u2019s ban on crossing from one genus to another: one\ncannot deduce a general proposition from one of its special cases\n(Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a728, 29; Bolzano 2004b: 122\u2013126). In a\nproof of the intermediate value theorem, for instance, one of the\nnecessary conditions is that the functions be real-valued. An\nattempted proof that makes no use of any attribute separating the\nreals from the rationals can accordingly be diagnosed as incorrect\naccording to the first criterion, while an attempted proof that\nappeals to geometry or kinematics will run afoul of the second. These\ninsights immediately bore fruit in Bolzano\u2019s mathematical work\n(1816, 1817).\n",
