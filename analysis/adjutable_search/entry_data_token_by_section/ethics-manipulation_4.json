    "main_text": "Answering the Identification Question || Manipulation as Bypassing Reason\n2.1 Manipulation as Bypassing Reason\n\nManipulation is often said to \u201cbypass\u201d the target\u2019s\nrational deliberation. It is not always clear, however, whether this\nclaim is meant as a definition of manipulation or merely as a\nstatement about manipulation (perhaps one that partly explains its\nmoral status). But let us consider whether the idea that manipulation\nbypasses reason can serve as a definition of manipulation.\n\nThe thought that manipulative influences bypass the target\u2019s\ncapacity for rational deliberation is appealing for at least two\nreasons. First, it seems reasonable to think that because manipulation\ndiffers from rational persuasion, it must influence behavior by means\nthat do not engage the target\u2019s rational capacities. Second, it\nseems intuitive to describe forms of influence that do clearly bypass\nthe target\u2019s capacity for rational deliberation as manipulative.\nFor example, suppose that subliminal advertising worked in the way\nthat it is commonly\u2014though probably\ninaccurately\u2014portrayed, so that being exposed to a subliminal\nmessage urging you to \u201cDrink Coke\u201d could influence your\nbehavior without engaging your mechanisms of rational deliberation.\nIntuitively such an influence would seem to be a clear case of\nmanipulation.\n\nSubliminal advertising tactics\u2014along with hypnosis and\nbehavioral conditioning\u2014are commonly portrayed as effective\nmethods to influence others without their knowledge and thus without\nengaging their capacities for rational deliberation. The effectiveness\nof such tactics is almost certainly wildly exaggerated in the popular\n(and sometimes philosophical) imagination. However, if we imagine them\nworking as well as they are sometimes portrayed, then they would\nconstitute clear examples of what it might mean to say that\nmanipulation bypasses reason. Thus, we might understand manipulation\nin terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and understand\n\u201cbypassing rational deliberation\u201d in terms of exploiting\npsychological mechanisms or techniques that can generate behavior\nwithout any input from rational deliberation.\n\nAnother way that manipulation might bypass rational deliberation would\nbe for it to appeal to non-conscious motivations. Eric Cave explores\nthis idea in a pair of papers (Cave 2007, 2014) on what he calls\n\u201cmotive manipulation.\u201d Cave distinguishes between\n\u201cconcerns,\u201d which are conscious pro-attitudes, and\nunconscious \u201cnon-concern motives.\u201d He then defines motive\nmanipulation as influence that operates by engaging unconscious\nnon-concern motives. This theory clearly implies that appeals to\nnon-conscious motives, as well as influences that operate via\n\u201cquasi-hypnotic techniques\u201d and \u201ccrude behavioral\nconditioning\u201d are manipulative (Cave 2014: 188). Although Cave\nhimself does not claim that all forms of manipulation are of this sort\n(Cave 2007: 130), would such a claim be plausible? Or could we add the\nappeal to non-conscious motives to the list of psychological\nmechanisms that bypass reason, and define manipulation in terms of\nexploiting such mechanisms?\n\nUnfortunately, this approach faces a serious problem. If we define\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and then use\nthe appeal to unconscious motives and exaggerated portrayals of\nhypnosis and subliminal advertising to illustrate what it means to\nbypass rational deliberation, we will set a very high bar for\nsomething to count as manipulation. This bar would be too high to\ncount any of Irving\u2019s tactics as manipulation, since none of\nthem completely bypasses Tonya\u2019s capacity for rational\ndeliberation in the way that subliminal advertising, hypnosis,\nconditioning, or the appeal to unconscious motives would appear to\ndo.\n\nPerhaps a more promising account of what it might mean for\nmanipulation to bypass reason would construe manipulation as an\ninfluence that is covert in a way that allows it to bypass reason.\nCertainly, if an influence is covert and thus escapes one\u2019s\nnotice, then it would also seem to escape any conscious reasoning\nprocess. An early version of the idea that manipulation is best\ncharacterized as covert influence was suggested by the political\ntheorist Alan Ware (1981). Ware characterizes manipulation as an\ninfluence on the target which is covert in the sense that the target\nlacks knowledge or understanding of how she is being influenced.\n\nA more recent version of this view was put forward by Daniel Susser,\nBeate Roessler, and Helen Nissenbaum, who write that:\n\u201cmanipulation is hidden influence. \u2026 Covertly influencing\nsomeone\u2014imposing a hidden influence\u2014means influencing them\nin a way they aren\u2019t consciously aware of, and in a way they\ncouldn\u2019t easily become aware of\u201d (Susser et al., 2019: 4).\nAlan Strudler suggests that \u201ca sufficient even though not\nexhaustive characterization of manipulation\u201d is that it involves\nchanging a person\u2019s behavior \u201cthrough a chain of events\nthat has the desired effect only because the person is unaware of that\nchain\u201d (Strudler 2005: 459).\n\nThis sort of view works well with influences like subliminal\nadvertising. But it would also appear to apply to other sorts of\npsychological influences that bypass conscious attention, such as\npriming effects and the decision-making biases and other processes\nthat involve unconscious, fast processing made famous by the work of\nDaniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and colleagues (see Kahneman 2013 for\nan overview). However, it faces obstacles in dealing with other clear\ncases of manipulation. Many manipulative influences, such as peer\npressure, nagging, emotional appeals, guilt trips, do not appear to be\nhidden influences. Indeed, it is difficult not to be aware of an\nattempted influence when that influence takes the form of nagging,\npeer pressure, or a guilt trip.\n\nPerhaps, though, it is not the influence itself that must be covert in\norder for it to bypass reason in the relevant sense. Perhaps it is\nsufficient that the intent behind it must be covert. On this view, the\ninfluence itself may not bypass conscious attention. Yet it might\nstill be the case that the covertness of the intent behind it renders\nit less likely to trigger rational scrutiny by the target. Even if I\nam aware of the attempt to influence me, if I am unaware of your true\nintentions, I might fail to engage in rational deliberation about\nwhether I should try to resist your influence.\n\nSuch a view is defended by Radim Belohrad (2019), who claims that\n\n\nIn manipulation, the influencer is keen to create an impression that\nher motives are very different from what she projects. \u2026 The\nmanipulator always projects intentions that differ from her real\nintentions. (2019: 457\u2013459)\n\n\nAlong similar lines, Gregory Whitfield (2020) claims that\n\nAn act of manipulation is any intentional attempt by an agent (A) to\ncause another agent (B) to will/prefer/intend/act other than what A\ntakes B\u2019s will, preference or intention to be, where A does so\nutilizing methods that obscure and render deniable A\u2019s\nintentions vis-\u00e0-vis B (2020: 11).\n\n\nIt is certainly true that manipulators often keep their true\nintentions hidden. Iago wants Othello to think that he intends to be\nhis friend, rather than the agent of his destruction. Exaggerating the\nbenefits of doing what the manipulator wants, while understating the\nadvantages of other options (tactic 2 on our list) probably works\nbest, if at all, if the target falsely believes that the manipulator\nintends to provide objective advice. However, there are other examples\nof manipulation where the intent does not seem to be hidden. The\nintent of a teenager nagging for a new cellphone is quite\ntransparent\u2014to get the parent to provide the new phone.\nSimilarly, when adolescents engage in peer pressure to get a fellow to\nsmoke, their intention\u2014to get the target to smoke\u2014is quite\ntransparent. Targets of guilt trips often\u2014perhaps\ntypically\u2014know exactly what the guilt tripper intends to get the\ntarget to do. Perhaps anticipating these worries, Whitfield allows\nmanipulation to occur when the manipulator has merely achieved\n\u201cplausible deniability\u201d about his true intentions. It is\nnot entirely clear, though, whether this feature allows the theory to\nescape the problem of forms of manipulation like nagging and peer\npressure. It is certainly not obvious that such tactics only work, or\nonly count as manipulation, if their users can plausibly deny their\nintentions.\n\nPerhaps we might characterize manipulation not in terms of bypassing\ndeliberation altogether, but in terms of bypassing rational\ndeliberation, that is, by introducing non-rational influences into the\ndeliberative process. Thus, we might follow Joseph Raz in claiming\nthat\n\n\nmanipulation, unlike coercion, does not interfere with a\nperson\u2019s options. Instead it perverts the way that person\nreaches decisions, forms preference, or adopts goals. (Raz 1988:\n377)\n\n\nTreating manipulation as bypassing rational deliberation, and\nthen characterizing \u201cbypassing rational deliberation\u201d in\nterms of introducing non-rational influences into deliberation, would\ncohere nicely with the observation that manipulation is a contrary of\nrational persuasion.\n\nDespite its appeal, this approach faces a significant challenge: Many\nforms of non-rational influence do not seem to be manipulative. For\nexample, graphic portrayals of the dangers of smoking or texting while\ndriving are not obviously manipulative even when they impart no new\ninformation to the target (Blumenthal-Barby 2012). In addition, moral\npersuasion often involves non-rational influence. Appeals to the\nGolden Rule invite the interlocutor to imagine how it would\nfeel to be on the receiving end of the action under\nconsideration. It is difficult to believe that all such appeals are\ninherently manipulative, even when they appeal more to the feelings\nthan to facts (of which the interlocutor may already be aware).\nFinally, consider something as innocuous as dressing up before going\non a date or an interview. Presumably, the purpose of such\n\u201cimpression management\u201d is to convey a certain impression\nto the audience. Yet dressing up on a single occasion provides little\nif any rational basis for conclusions about what the\nwell-dressed person is really like day in and day out. Thus,\nimpression management of this sort seems to be an attempt at\nnon-rational influence. Yet it seems odd to count it as\nmanipulation\u2014especially if we treat \u201cmanipulation\u201d\nas having a connotation of being immoral. Of course, we might avoid\nthis problem by defining \u201cmanipulation\u201d in a morally\nneutral way, and then claiming that these forms of manipulation are\nnot immoral, while others are. But this would merely move the problem\nwithout solving it, for now we would want to know what distinguishes\nimmoral forms of manipulation from those that are not immoral.\n\nPerhaps we could address this problem by defining reason more broadly,\nso that appeals to emotions could count as forms of rational\npersuasion. Such a move might be independently motivated by the\nrejection of what some critics regard as the hyper-cognitivist radical\nseparation of reason from emotion. However, it is not clear that\nallowing emotional appeals to count as rational persuasion will get us\nvery far in defining manipulation in terms of bypassing reason. For\nwhile we will have avoided the implausible implication that all\nappeals to emotion are ipso facto manipulative, we now face\nthe question of which appeals to emotion are manipulative and which\nare not. And that is close to the very question that the idea of\nbypassing reason was supposed to help us answer.\n\nThus, despite the plausibility of the claim that manipulation bypasses\nthe target\u2019s capacities for rational deliberation, using this\nclaim to define manipulation faces serious challenges: If we\ntake \u201cbypassing\u201d very literally, then the account seems to\nmiss many examples of genuine manipulation. But if we loosen our\nunderstanding of \u201cbypassing reason\u201d so that it applies to\nany non-rational form of influence, then it seems to count as\nmanipulative many forms of influence that do not seem manipulative.\nAnd if we fix that problem by adopting a conception of reason\naccording to which appeals to the emotions are not ipso facto\nnon-rational, then we are left with the original problem of\ndetermining which appeals to the emotions are manipulative and which\nare not. Perhaps there is a way to characterize \u201cbypassing\nreason\u201d that can undergird a plausible definition of\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing reason. But the most obvious ways\nto define \u201cbypassing reason\u201d face serious problems.\n\nNevertheless, even if defining manipulation in terms of bypassing\nreason turns out to be a dead end, it is still possible that\nmanipulation really does bypass reason in some sense. But it\nmay turn out that we need an independent definition of manipulation\nbefore we can determine in what sense manipulation bypasses\nreason. Some writers, such as Cass Sunstein and Jason Hanna, seem to\nhave such an approach in mind when they initially characterize\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing or subverting reason, but then go\non to gloss \u201cbypassing or subverting\u201d in terms of some\nother account of manipulation (Sunstein 2016: 82\u201389; Hanna\n2015).\n\nHowever, a recent argument by Moti Gorin raises questions for the\nclaim that manipulation bypasses reason\u2014even when that claim is\nnot being used to define what manipulation is (Gorin 2014a). Gorin\nargues that manipulation can occur even when the target is offered\nonly good reasons. His argument turns largely on examples like this:\nJames wishes for Jacques\u2019s death, since this would enable James\nto inherit a large fortune. James knows that Jacques believes that (1)\nGod exists, and that (2) if God did not exist, life would be\nmeaningless, and he would have no reason to go on living. James\nprovides Jacques with rational arguments against the existence of God.\nThese arguments fully engage Jacques\u2019s rational faculties, and\nconsequently Jacques concludes that God does not exist. Jacques\npromptly commits suicide\u2014just as Jack had hoped he would. As\nGorin notes, James\u2019s activities do not appear to have bypassed,\nsubverted, or otherwise been detrimental to Jacques\u2019s capacity\nfor reason\u2014indeed, James depended on Jacques\u2019s ability to\nemploy his rational faculties to draw (what James regarded as) the\ncorrect conclusion from his arguments. If we accept Gorin\u2019s\ncharacterization of James\u2019s actions as manipulative, then his\nexample poses a significant challenge to the claim that manipulation\nalways bypasses the target\u2019s capacity for rational\ndeliberation.\n",
