    "main_text": "Reproduction and Replication\n2. Reproduction and Replication\n\nWork on inheritance systems is often situated in the context of\ndevelopmental evolutionary biology, and attaches great significance to\nthe ways in which inheritance interacts with the development of\nphenotypes. This section contrasts this perspective on inheritance\nwith views that focus on replication. James Griesemer\u2019s\nreproducer notion which combines inheritance and development is\npresented. Finally, the relationship between inheritance systems and\nnotions of biological information is discussed.\n",
