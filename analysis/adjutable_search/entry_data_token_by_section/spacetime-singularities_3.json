Naked Singularities, the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis, and Indeterminism\n\nWhile spacetime singularities in general are frequently viewed with\nsuspicion, physicists often offer the reassurance that, even if they\nare real, we expect most of them to be hidden away behind the event\nhorizons of black holes. Such singularities therefore could not affect\nus unless we were actually to jump into the black hole. A naked\nsingularity, on the other hand, is one that is not hidden behind an\nevent horizon. Such singularities appear much more threatening because\nthey are uncontained, freely accessible to the rest of spacetime. \n\nThe heart of the worry is that singular structure seems to signify so\nprofound a breakdown in the fundamental structure of spacetime that it\ncould wreak havoc on any region of the universe that it were visible\nto. Because the structures that break down in singular spacetimes are\nin general required for the formulation of our known physical laws,\nand of initial-value problems for individual physical systems in\nparticular, one such fear is that determinism would collapse entirely\nwherever the singular breakdown were causally visible. In Earman's\n(1995, pp. 65\u20136) evocative conceit, nothing would seem to stop\nthe singularity from disgorging any manner of unpleasant jetsam, from\nTVs showing Nixon's Checkers Speech to old lost socks, in a way\ncompletely undetermined by the state of spacetime in any region\nwhatsoever. As a result, there could be no reasonable expectation of\ndeterminism, nor even just predictability, for any region in causal\ncontact with what it spews out. \n\nOne form that such a naked singularity could take is that of a\nwhite hole, which is a time-reversed black hole. Imagine\ntaking a film of a black hole forming from the collapse of a massive\nobject, say, a star, with light, dust, rockets, astronauts and old\nsocks falling into it during its subsequent evolution. Now imagine\nthat film being run backwards. This is the picture of a white hole:\none starts with a naked singularity, out of which might appear people,\nrockets, socks\u2014anything at all\u2014with eventually a star\nbursting forth. Absolutely nothing in the causal past of such a white\nhole would determine what would pop out of it, since, as follows from\nthe No Hair Theorems\n (section 3.2),\n items that fall into a black hole leave no trace on the future\noutside of it. (This description should feel familiar to the canny\nreader: it is the same as the way that increase of entropy in ordinary\nthermodynamics as embodied in the Second Law makes retrodiction\nimpossible; the relationship of black holes to thermodynamics is\ndiscussed in\n section 5.)\n Because the field equations of general relativity do not pick out a\npreferred direction of time, if the formation of a black hole is\nallowed by the laws of spacetime and gravity, then those laws also\npermit white holes. \n\nRoger Penrose (1969, 1973) famously suggested that although naked\nsingularities are compatible with general relativity, in physically\nrealistic situations they will never form; that is, any process that\nresults in a singularity will safely ensconce that singularity behind\nan event horizon. This conjecture, known as the Cosmic Censorship\nHypothesis, has met with some success and popularity; however, it also\nfaces several difficulties. As in our previous discussions of\nsingularities and black holes, there are questions about how exactly\nto formulate the hypothesis, and, once formulated, about whether or\nnot it holds in general relativity as a whole, or at least in some\nphysically reasonable subset of spacetimes\u2014where, again,\n\u201cphysically reasonable\u201d will likely be a vague and\ncontroversial notion. \n\nPenrose's original formulation relied on black holes: a suitably\ngeneric singularity will always be contained in a black hole (and so\ncausally invisible outside the black hole). As the counter-examples to\nvarious ways of articulating the hypothesis based on this idea have\naccumulated over the years, however, it has gradually been abandoned\n(Geroch and Horowitz 1979; Krolak 1986; Penrose 1998; Joshi et\nal. 2002; Joshi 2003, 2007a; Joshi and Malafarina 2011a, 2011b).\nMore recent approaches either begin with an attempt to provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for cosmic censorship itself,\nyielding an indirect characterization of a naked singularity as any\nphenomenon violating those conditions, or else they begin with an\nattempt to provide a characterization of a naked singularity without\nreference to black holes and so conclude with a definite statement of\ncosmic censorship as the absence of such phenomena (Geroch and\nHorowitz 1979). The variety of proposals made using both approaches is\ntoo great to canvass here; the interested reader is referred to\nRingstr\u00f6m (2010) for a review of the current state of the art for\nstandard black holes, Nielsen (2012) for cosmic censorship regarding\nHayward's quasi-local black holes\n (section 3.3),\n Ringstr\u00f6m (2010) for a review of the bearing of the\ninitial-value problem in general relativity on cosmic censorship, and\nto Earman (1995, ch. 3) and Curiel (1999) for philosophical discussion\nof many of the earlier proposals. Manchak (2011) gives reasons for\nthinking that the question of providing a completely satisfactory\nformulation of the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis may never be settled,\non the grounds that the idea of what counts as \u201cphysically\nreasonable\u201d is not an empirically determinable question. Still,\nthe possibility may remain open that there be several different,\ninequivalent formulations of the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis, each\nhaving its own advantages and problems, none \u201ccanonical\u201d\nin a definitive sense, as may be the case for definitions of\nsingularities and black holes themselves. \n\nThere is another area of investigation intimately related to issues of\nCosmic Censorship in general, and issues of determinism in general\nrelativity in particular: whether or not spacetime is\n\u201chole-free\u201d. This has been the subject of recent\nphilosophical work, primarily by Manchak (2009b, 2014a, 2016a). Geroch\n(1977) originally proposed the idea of a generic \u201chole\u201d in\nspacetime in trying to capture in as general terms as possible the\nidea that spacetime has no obstruction of any kind that would prevent\nit from \u201cevolving as far into the future as it reasonably\ncould\u201d. (Recall the discussion of maximality and extendibility\nin\n section 1.1.)\n Although Geroch's definition had powerful conceptual appeal, in the\nevent it has proven untenable: Krasnikov (2009) showed that, according\nto it, even Minkowski spacetime fails to be hole-free. Manchak (2009b)\nshowed how an emendation of Geroch's definition could fix the problem.\nHe then showed that, under the assumption of global hyperbolicity (a\nstrong condition of causal well-behavedness for a spacetime), one gets\na nice hierarchy of conditions relating to determinism: geodesic\ncompleteness implies effective completeness (Manchak's own condition),\nwhich implies inextendibility, which implies hole-freeness (Manchak\n2014a; see\n section 1.1\n for the definitions of these conditions). In related work, Manchak\n(2014b) showed that, in a sense one can make precise, it should be\neasier to construct a machine that would result in spacetime's having\nsuch a hole than one that would result in time-travel. In short,\ncreating the possibility for indeterminism seems easier in the theory\nthan the possibility for causal paradox! \n\nManchak (2016a) also recently introduced a new kind of pathology a\nspacetime can have, an \u201cepistemic hole\u201d: roughly speaking,\na spacetime has an epistemic hole if two observers in initially\nidentical epistemic states can evolve in such a way that what one can\nlearn can only ever be, in principle, a proper subset of what the\nother can learn. Manchak shows that, if a spacetime has no epistemic\nholes then (under mild conditions on the niceness of the causal\nstructure) the spacetime has no naked singularities as standardly\nconstrued. The condition differs also in its modal character from\nother such hole-freeness conditions, for it makes significantly weaker\nand more conceptually and technically tractable modal claims. \n\nIssues of determinism, from an epistemic perspective, are intimately\nbound up with the possibility of reliable prediction. (See the entry\n Causal Determinism.)\n The general issue of predictability itself in general relativity,\neven apart from the specific problems that singular structure may\nraise, is fascinating, philosophically rich, and very much unsettled.\nOne can make a prima facie strong argument, for example, that\nprediction is possible in general relativity only in spacetimes that\npossess singularities (Hogarth 1997; Manchak 2013)! See\nGeroch (1977), Glymour (1977), Malament (1977), and Manchak (2008,\n2013) for discussion of these and many other related issues. \n\nHere again, as with almost all the issues discussed up to this point\nin this entry regarding singularities and black holes, is an example\nof a sizable subculture in physics working on matters that have no\nclearly or even unambiguously defined physical parameters to inform\nthe investigations and no empirical evidence to guide or even just\nconstrain them, the parameters of the debate imposed by and large by\nthe intuitions of a handful of leading researchers. From sociological,\nphysical, and philosophical vantage points, one may well wonder, then,\nwhy so many physicists continue to work on it, and what sort of\ninvestigation they are engaged in. Perhaps nowhere else in general\nrelativity, or even in physics, can one observe such a delicate\ninterplay of, on the one hand, technical results, definitions and\ncriteria, and, on the other hand, conceptual puzzles and even\nincoherence, largely driven by the inchoate intuitions of physicists.\nNot everyone views the situation with excitement or even equanimity,\nhowever: see Curiel (1999) for a somewhat skeptical discussion of the\nwhole endeavor. \n",
