    "main_text": "The Justification of Revelatory Claims || Inferential Justification\n2.3 Inferential Justification\n\nThis section will continue, for a while, with the theme of divine\ntestimony, but now from a reductionist perspective. The accounts\nstudied so far work with an anti-reductionist (non-inferential) view\nof testimonial justification. However, it can be argued that when it\ncomes to believing purportedly divine testimony, the stakes are too\nhigh for it to be rational to trust without positive evidence of\ntrustworthiness (King 2008: 78).\n\nAccording to King, rational belief in divine self-testimony requires\nthat God gives us \u201csufficient evidence to trust in him\u201d\n(King 2008: 176). We can know by a priori reasoning what kind\nof evidence God must provide in order to win our trust, and so we can\nanticipate that God (if he exists) will provide this kind of evidence.\nImportantly, a divine revelation must be \u201cdiscrete\u201d and\navailable only to a few people at first, since a \u201cmajor\u201d\nrevelation immediately apparent for a global audience would obscure\nGod\u2019s love with overwhelming power. King provides a list of\npossible evidences that satisfy the requirement of discreetness,\nincluding \u201ca sense of [divine] presence\u201d, \u201cinternal\ncommunication (including dreams, visions)\u201d, \u201cfulfilled\nprophecies, Resurrection, Incarnation\u201d. Any conceivable\nrevelation must choose its means from this list and hence conform to a\nnecessary structure, which accommodates the cognitive limitations of\nhuman beings and makes it possible for them to trust in a rational\nway. King refers to his epistemological model as\n\u201ctrust-evidentialism\u201d (2008: 174, 176).\n\nEven though King\u2019s account is ostensibly different from the\nnon-inferential testimonial models presented above, the differences\nmight be smaller than first appears. As we have seen, \u201cdoxastic\nresponsibility\u201d requires extensive reasoning from evidence in\nWahlberg\u2019s account, even though such reasoning is construed as\ndefeater-deflecting rather than as trust-grounding.\n\nAs the example of King illustrates, inferential models for the\njustification of revelation can be construed as testimonial, if\ntestimonial justification is understood in a reductionist way. John\nLocke is a classic example of this. \n\n\nFaith \u2026 is the assent to any proposition \u2026 upon the\ncredit of the proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way\nof communication. This way of discovering truths to men we call\nRevelation. (Essay Concerning Human Understanding,\nIV, xviii, 2) \n\n\nHowever, testimonial justification, for Locke, is reducible to\nargument from evidence.\n2.3.1 A Probabilistic Argument\n\nIn order to see the general strengths and problems of inferential\nmodels of justification, it will be helpful to focus on a paradigmatic\nexample in the tradition of Tillotson and Locke. Perhaps the most\ninfluential evidentialist account of the justification of revelatory\nclaims is the one proposed by Richard Swinburne. His argument can be\nformalized using probability calculus and Bayes Theorem (Swinburne\n2007: 345\u2013356), but the discussion below will proceed\ninformally. After a presentation of Swinburne\u2019s argument, some\ncritical and complementary perspectives will be addressed. \n\nFor Swinburne, rational acceptance of a revelatory claim must be based\non evidence, and how strong the evidence needs to be depends on what\nbackground beliefs we have. If we have good reason to believe,\nindependently of any purported revelation, that God exists and that a\nrevelation from him is to be expected, then rational acceptance of a\nrevelatory claim can be based on more modest evidence than would\notherwise be the case. It is hence important for Swinburne to build a\ncase for the existence of God based on natural theology, and then\nestablish the likelihood of a revelation on the basis of a\npriori reasoning about what God is likely to do.\n\nSwinburne thinks that natural theological arguments make God\u2019s\nexistence at least as probable as his non-existence, and that a\npriori reasoning about God leads to the conclusion that a\nrevelation is to be expected. A God who has made rational creatures\nwould want to interact with them, and for this to be possible, they\nwould need to know more about God\u2019s nature and character than\nwhat is naturally accessible to them. Furthermore, it would be good\nfor humans to receive moral enlightenment from God, and encouragement\nto live morally good lives. Since God is good, these considerations\nmake a revelation likely. Moreover, Swinburne argues that a good God\nwould have reason to become incarnate in order to atone for\nsin and to identify with our suffering. If this is to be effectual, a\nrevelation that tells us about the incarnation and atonement is\nnecessary. It is also to be expected that a divine revelation would\nnot come with overwhelming evidence in its favor but require some\nsearching activity on the part of humans. This would encourage human\ncooperation and co-responsibility and strengthen desire for the goal\nof salvation. Since a revelation would have to be translated between\ndifferent cultures and across time, there must also be included in the\nrevelation some means of continuing guidance\u2014a church that can\nensure that interpretations and translations are correct (Swinburne\n2007: 103\u2013104. For a more fully developed perspective on the\necclesial mediation of revelation, see Levering 2014).\n\nArmed with the purported background knowledge that a certain kind of\nrevelation is likely, Swinburne suggests four \u201ctests\u201d or\ncriteria for credible revelatory claims (Swinburne 2007: Ch. 6). The\nfirst criterion is that the content of a purported revelation concerns\nthings that are important for our deepest well-being, and that this\ncontent is not very improbable on grounds independent of revelation.\nThis \u201ccontent test\u201d must be complemented by a\n\u201cmiracle test\u201d, which is the second criterion. If God\nwants us to be able to identify a divine revelation as such, he must\ndeliver it in a way that only God could do. This requires a divine\nsignature in the form of a confirming miracle, in the sense of a\nviolation of a natural law. Third, if a revelation is to have a\ndeterminate content that is not endlessly open to interpretation, a\ngenuine revelation must contain instructions for how an interpretive\nchurch is to be constituted, and the interpretations of this church\nmust be plausible as interpretations of the original revelation. The\nfourth test is that the church\u2019s interpretations of revelation\nmust not be very implausible on other, independent grounds.\n\nWhen applying these tests to the great world religions, Swinburne\nclaims to find that the purported Christian revelation is the only\nserious candidate. No other religion can point to a reasonable amount\nof evidence for a foundational, authenticating miracle like the\nresurrection of Jesus, nor does any other religion satisfy the other\nthree tests. This shows that the coincidence of the satisfaction of\nall four tests (even to a moderate degree) \u201cis an extremely\nunlikely event in the normal course of things\u201d (Swinburne 2007:\n337). Since Christianity satisfies all four tests, according to\nSwinburne, it is very probable that its purported revelation is true.\nIn order to show that Christianity satisfies the tests, Swinburne\nproduces a complex argument based on evidence from many sources (for\nexample, historical arguments about the acts and teachings of Jesus,\nevidence for the resurrection, arguments for the moral goodness of\nChristian teachings, etc.). It is the cumulative force of the total\nevidence that makes belief in the Christian revelatory claim\njustified.\n\nA general criticism that can be directed against Swinburne\u2019s\naccount\u2014as well as other inferential accounts (e.g., King\n2008)\u2014is that it seems to draw on the Christian religion as a\nkind of intuition-pump for what are supposed to be \u201ca\npriori\u201d features of any genuine revelation. For example,\nSwinburne argues that it is a priori likely that God will\nbecome incarnated and atone for human sin, and that this therefore is\na part of the content-criterion by which to test purported\nrevelations. Many would argue, however, that this reasoning is\n\u201cad hoc and post eventum\u201d and biased in\nfavor of the Christian tradition (Abraham 2006: 73. See also Stump\n1994: 740; McLean 2013).\n\nSwinburne\u2019s argument invites detailed objections on practically\nevery point, but he has also defended every step of the argument\nextensively in separate works about natural theology, the incarnation,\natonement theory, and the resurrection (2004a; 1994; 1989; 2003).\nEspecially the historical argument for a resurrection is crucial for\nSwinburne\u2019s case. The debates generated by criticism of\nSwinburne\u2019s historical claims and claims about natural theology\ncannot be addressed here. However, the very fact that\nSwinburne\u2019s argument, in order to succeed, needs to establish\nmany controversial propositions has been seen, by some, as a fatal\nweakness (Plantinga 2000b, 271\u2013280; Hasker 2002: 256\u2013257).\n\nAppealing to a general \u201cprinciple of dwindling\nprobabilities\u201d, Plantinga has argued that complex inferential\ncases for Christianity of the kind Swinburne presents must necessarily\nfail. Such complex arguments chain together a number of logically\nindependent propositions, most of which are merely probable given the\nevidence. For every merely probable proposition that is needed to\nreach the conclusion, the probability of the hypothesis as a whole\nwill decrease, since the probabilities at each stage of the argument\nmust be multiplied. Plantinga argues that even if the probabilities of\nthe individual propositions are given a very generous\nestimate\u2014for example, if we assign the probability 0.9 to the\nproposition that God exists (on our background knowledge)\u2014the\noverall conclusion about the Christian revelation will still have a\nprobability well below 0.5. Plantinga, therefore, concludes that the\ninferential case for the Christian revelation \n\n\nisn\u2019t strong enough to produce warranted belief \u2026 at\nmost, it could produce the warranted belief that the main lines of\nChristian teaching aren\u2019t particularly improbable. (Plantinga\n2000b: 271)\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s argument seems to threaten the whole inferential\nproject. In response, however, it can be argued that it proves too\nmuch. All historical arguments (even secular ones) link together\npropositions that are merely probable. If the principle of dwindling\nprobabilities is valid and has the implications that Plantinga claims,\nit could be applied to all historical arguments, with the result that\nno historical argument could succeed. This, however, is a conclusion\nthat many would be reluctant to draw (Swinburne 2004b: 540; 2007:\n356).\n\nTim and Lydia McGrew have provided what many take to be a strong\nresponse to Plantinga\u2019s argument from dwindling probabilities\n(McGrew 2004; McGrew and McGrew 2006). Basically, they argue that at\nleast the steepness of the \u201cdwindling\u201d is an illusion\ncreated by the way Plantinga (mis)represents the\ninferential-historical case for a Christian revelation. Among other\nshortcomings, Plantinga\u2019s construal fails to bring out how\nevidence for a proposition that is \u201cdownstream\u201d in the\nargument (such as \u201cGod raised Jesus from the dead\u201d) is\nrelevant for assessing the probability of a proposition that is\n\u201cupstream\u201d (such as \u201cGod exists\u201d). While\nPlantinga concedes ground to some of the critique (2006), he\nnevertheless stands by his general argument (2015: 262. For an\noverview of the debate, see Nickel 2015: 225\u2013235 and Crisp\n2009.)\n2.3.2 Holism\n\nAnother response to the purported threat of dwindling probabilities is\nsuggested by Menssen and Sullivan (2007). They defend a basically\nSwinburnian inferential project, but criticize Swinburne for being\ninsufficiently holistic, in a sense to be explained below (2007:\n55\u201356). With respect to the argument about dwindling\nprobabilities, they acknowledge that a complex proposition cannot have\na greater probability than any of its constituent claims. However,\nthey argue that in certain cases, the complex proposition \u201ccould\nstill be more believable\u201d (2007: 61). For example, the\nclaim that \u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus that is\nperturbing its orbit\u201d is more complex than the weaker claim that\n\u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus\u201d. Nevertheless,\nscientists did not first attempt to prove the weaker claim, and then\nwent on to prove the stronger (more complex) claim. Instead, they\nestablished the truth of the weaker claim by establishing the\ntruth of the stronger.\n\nThe lesson to learn from this, according to Menssen and Sullivan, is\nthat the project of justifying revelatory claims should not await the\nestablishing of God\u2019s existence by means of traditional natural\ntheology (as suggested by Swinburne 2004b: 538 and Mavrodes 1988: 102). Instead,\nrevelatory claims should be investigated as part of the project of\njustifying theism\u2014the only condition for such investigation\nbeing that the existence of a world-creator is not highly unlikely. In\nfact, \n\n\na negative conclusion concerning the existence of a good God is not\njustified unless the content of a reasonable number of leading\nrevelatory claims has been seriously considered. (Menssen and Sullivan\n2007: 63) \n\n\nThis is because the \u201cproblem of evil\u201d counts as evidence\nagainst God\u2019s existence. To exclude putative revelations from\nconsideration before God\u2019s existence has been established would\nbe to refuse to \u201clisten to the voice of the accused\u201d. What\nif a putative revelation contains an acceptable explanation of evil,\nthat blocks or weakens the atheistic arguments? Not to take this\npossibility into account would, arguably, be to handicap the\nevidentialist project by forcing it to proceed without a \u201cfull\ndatabase\u201d (Kwan 2011: 472). Hence, the \u201cholistic\u201d\napproach of Menssen and Sullivan might be seen as an improvement in\nrelation to the more traditional, \u201clayered\u201d approach of\nSwinburne. (However, Swinburne\u2019s distinction between\n\u201cbare\u201d and \u201cramified\u201d natural theology point\nin a holistic direction, see 2004b: 533\u2013535.)\n2.3.3 Voluntarism\n\nOther critics of Swinburne point out that he ignores the role played\nby emotions, desires and the will in coming to faith (Hasker 2002:\n257\u2013258). Is belief in a divine revelation only a matter of\nBayesian calculation of probabilities? This lacuna in\nSwinburne\u2019s thought\u2014as well as in much evidentialist\nreflection in general\u2014has been addressed by Paul Moser, who\nintroduces an existential-affective dimension in the inferential\nproject. His central claim is that our access to evidence for\nGod\u2019s existence might depend on our volitional and affective\nstates (2008; 2010. See also Wainwright 2006).\n\nMoser believes that God is \u201chidden\u201d, at least for some\npeople some of the time, in the sense that his existence is not beyond\nreasonable doubt. This fact should not be taken as a reason for\nskepticism, however, since it is to be expected that a perfectly\nloving God would only make evidence of his existence available when\nthis is likely to elicit the right human response. God does not reveal\nhimself simply in order to slake our curiosity, but only with the\npurpose of accomplishing, in a non-coercive way, a moral\ntransformation of humans to align their wills and character with\nGod\u2019s character and purposes. We should hence expect evidence\nfor God to be purposively available.\n\nMoser claims that his emphasis on the volitional element in our\nepistemic responses to divine revelation constitutes \u201ca\nCopernican Revolution in cognitive matters about God\u2019s\nexistence\u201d (2008: 4). However, it would be more accurate to say\nthat he revives a classical theme, found in the church fathers and\nAquinas (Macdonald 2009a: 137). For Aquinas, for example, it is the\nwill that moves the intellect to the assent of faith (as emphasized by\nthe \u201cvoluntarist interpretation\u201d, see\n section 2.1\n above).\n\nAnother philosopher who stresses the personal dimension of faith and\nits epistemic relevance is Abraham, who notes that revelation is a\n\u201cthreshold concept\u201d. By accepting a revelatory claim,\none\u2019s perception of the world changes in a fundamental way. This\nis a \u201cprofoundly self-involving experience\u201d and a\n\u201cmassive cognitive and spiritual revolution\u201d (Abraham\n2006: 87, 89). \n2.3.4 Hybridism\n\nFinally, it must be considered whether a \u201chybrid\u201d approach\nto revelatory claims\u2014combining inferential and non-inferential\nmodes of justification\u2014might be fruitful. Abraham (2006 and\n1982) suggests that this is the case. Inspired by Plantinga\u2019s\ntheory of a sensus divinitatis, Abraham claims that we come\nequipped with an oculus contemplationis, \u201ca\nspiritually discerning eye\u201d that allows us to discern\nGod\u2019s presence and activity in nature and history through a\n\u201cbasic cognitive act\u201d (2006: 69). \n\nHowever, Abraham considers arguments from evidence to be\n\u201csupplementary to the appeal to the oculus\ncontemplationis\u201d. Miracles, for example, have a genuine\nepistemic freight and the kind of data appealed to in evidentialist\nreasoning about revelation can \n\n\noperate as corroborating evidence that coheres with and thus\nstrengthens the initial beliefs legitimately formed independently of\npropositional evidence. (2006: 72, 77)\n\n\nAbraham\u2019s portrayal of revelation as a \u201cthreshold\nconcept\u201d also seems to open up the possibility of a kind of\n\u201cretroactive\u201d justification: Once a revelatory claim has\nbeen accepted, the new perspective one has gained will make one\ncapable of seeing the cognitive errors of one\u2019s previous\nposition. Charles Taylor has described this kind of retroactive\njustification as a \u201csupersession argument\u201d (2005:\n340\u2013341).\n2.4 Sui Generis Approaches\n\nA possibility (or purported possibility) that has not been considered\nso far, is that belief in divine revelation could be justified in a\nway that is totally sui generis. Inspired by Kierkegaard,\nKarl Barth seems to suggest something like this. Human nature is not\nin any way adapted to receive knowledge of God, according to Barth,\nand hence there can be no philosophical explanation of how knowledge\nof God comes about. However, God himself could provide such knowledge\nwithout respecting the criteria of any epistemological canon. Barth\nwriters:\n\n\nTo say \u201cGod with us\u201d is to say something which has no\nbasis or possibility outside itself, which can in no sense be\nexplained in terms of man and man\u2019s situation, but only as\nknowledge of God from God, as free and unmerited grace. As the Bible\nbears witness to God\u2019s revelation and as Church proclamation\ntakes up this witness in obedience, both renounce any foundation apart\nfrom that which God has given once and for all by speaking (Barth\n1975: 119\u2013120).\n\n\nCritics have accused Barth of portraying revelation \n\n\nas something having full authority over the insights of reason and\nsensibility, and as not in any way subject to them. (Quash 2007: 334)\n\n\n\nAccording to Pannenberg, this is equivalent to fideism. \n\n\nBarth\u2019s apparently so lofty objectivity about God and\nGod\u2019s word turns out to rest on no more than the irrational\nsubjectivity of a venture of faith with no justification outside\nitself. (1976: 273)\n\n\nIn response to this kind of criticism, theologians in the\n\u201cpostliberal\u201d tradition (inspired by Barth) have argued\nthat revelation is not an epistemological concept at all. The\nChristian doctrine of revelation does not purport to explain how\nChristina beliefs are justified. Instead, it provides an\nintra-theological explication of God\u2019s prevenient grace\n(Thiemann 1985: 4). Some have even gone so far as to say that\n\u201cthe very idea that the Bible is revealed \u2026 is a claim\nthat creates more trouble than it is worth\u201d (Hauerwas 1981: 57).\nFor postliberal theologians in general, Christian beliefs are\njustified by being part of a coherent web of beliefs (Marshall\n2000).\n\nHowever, perhaps a better way of defending Barth is suggested by Hans\nUrs von Balthasar. He shares Barth\u2019s general view of revelation\nas epistemically self-authenticating and as providing its own warrant,\nindependently of human preconceptions (Chapp 2004: 11). However,\nBalthasar attempts to make this view intelligible by suggesting an\nanalogy with aesthetic experience. In Mozart\u2019s Jupiter\nSymphony, for example, every note seems to be necessary in the\nsense that any change would make the symphony less beautiful. However,\nnobody (except Mozart himself) could have said in advance that\nprecisely this combination of notes is necessary in order to\nproduce such beauty. Hence, our recognition of the beauty or\nperfection of the symphony happens without reference to any criteria\nor rules that we could have stated independently of encountering the\nsymphony itself. In a similar way, revelation possesses its own\nintrinsic credibility, rooted in the self-authenticating glory of God.\n\u201cDivine love\u201d, writes Balthasar, \n\n\ncan appear in such an overwhelming way that its glorious majesty\nthrows one to the ground; it shines out as the last word and leaves\none no choice but to respond in the mode of pure, blind obedience.\n(Balthasar 2004: 53, 57) \n",
