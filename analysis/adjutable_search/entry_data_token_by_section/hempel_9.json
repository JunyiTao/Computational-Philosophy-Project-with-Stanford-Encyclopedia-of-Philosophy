    "main_text": "Scientific Explanations || The Semi-Formal Explication\n4.1 The Semi-Formal Explication\n\nFor Aristotle, the general premises of scientific explanations are\ngeneralizations that describe commensurately universal\nproperties of things of a subject kind, \\(K\\). Merely\nuniversal properties are ones that everything of kind \\(K\\)\nhas but could be without and remain a thing of that\nkind, just as every Honda might have Michelin tires. Aristotle\nreferred to such properties as \u201caccidental\u201d.\nCommensurately universal properties are ones that belong to everything\nof the kind as necessary attributes that they cannot be without. A\ntriangle, for example, has three lines and angles. Aristotle referred\nto them as \u201cessential\u201d. Because generalizations about the\nessential properties of things of a kind are \u201cproper\ndefinitions\u201d, they provide the basis for explanations that\nqualify as analytic. Hempel encompassed analytic generalizations\nwithin the scope of \u201cfundamental laws\u201d as defined in\nHempel and Oppenheim (1948), but he focused on those that were\nsynthetic.\n\nAnalytic explanations are common in the currents of daily life,\nespecially in the context of explaining how you \u201cknow\nthat\u201d something is the case. A mother might explain to her\nsingle daughter that she knows that John must be unmarried, because a\nfriend told her that John is a bachelor. Similar cases of analytic\nexplanations can occur in scientific contexts, such as knowing that\nthe element they are dealing with is gold because it has atomic number\n79, when gold is defined by its atomic number. Knowing why John is a\nbachelor, however, is another matter. Indeed, in Hempel (1965c), he\nwould distinguish between reason-seeking why-questions and\nexplanation-seeking why-questions, where the former seek\nreasons that justify believing that something is the case, as opposed\nto the latter, which are usually motivated by knowledge that a\nspecific event has occurred.\n\nIn his semi-formal explication of the requirements for adequate\nscientific explanations, Hempel specified four conditions of adequacy\n(CA) that have to be satisfied, namely:\n\n(CA-1)\nThe explanandum must be a deductive consequence of the explanans;\n\n(CA-2)\nThe explanans must contain general laws, which are required to\nsatisfy (CA-1);\n(CA-3)\nThe explanans must have empirical content and must be capable of\ntest; and, \n(CA-4)\nThe sentences of the explanans must be true. (Hempel &\nOppenheim 1948)\n\n\nThese conditions are intended to serve as requirements whose\nsatisfaction guarantees that a proposed explanation is adequate.\nHempel drew several distinctions over time between potential\nscientific explanations (which satisfy the first three conditions, but\npossibly not the fourth) and confirmed scientific\nexplanations (which are believed to be true but might turn out to be\nfalse). Hempel recognized that (CA-3) was a redundant condition, since\nit would have to be satisfied by any explanation that satisfied (CA-1)\nand (CA-2). Insofar as the explanandum describes an event that\noccurred during the history of the world, its derivation thereby\nimplies the explanans has empirical content.\n",
