    "main_text": "Later Improvements || Disappointment-prevention Principle\n4.1 Disappointment-prevention Principle\n\nFor Bentham, the unhappiness created by the loss of something will\nusually have a greater impact on a person than the happiness brought\nabout by its gain to someone else (1838\u201343, I, 304\u20137). All\nother things being equal, the reduction of utility to one person\ncaused by theft will have a greater bearing on that person\u2019s\nhappiness than the gain in utility to another person from a lottery\nwin of the same monetary value. Of course, if the loser is a wealthy\nperson and the gainer a poor man, this will not hold. But in the\nnormal run of things, this is why Bentham gave a higher priority to\nthe protection of property by law and why he held that the alleviation\nof suffering demands more immediate attention than plans to produce\nwealth (1952\u201354, III, 324, 342). It is also the rationale for\nwhat Bentham later called the \u201cdisappointment-prevention\nprinciple\u201d (1838\u201343, V, 416), which requires that the\nsecurity of legitimate expectations take precedence over other ends,\nsave where the public interest manifestly justifies government\nintervention, such as raising funds through taxation for vital\nservices and the emergency expropriation of property in times of war\nor famine, usually with compensation paid to the property owner.\n\nFor Bentham, the significance of this principle as a practical guide\ncould hardly be overstated. It is, he says, the \u201cone\nall-comprehensive rule\u201d upon which all property arrangements\nought to be based (1983a, 308), and by this, \u201cthe first\napplication, or say emanation, of the greatest happiness\nprinciple\u201d, all the arrangements of the law of property\n\u201cin its most extensive sense\u201d, meaning \u201call objects\nof general desire\u201d, ought to be ordered (295\u201396; see also\n1838\u201343, III, 312).\n",
