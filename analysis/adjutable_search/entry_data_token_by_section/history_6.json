    "main_text": "Continental philosophy of history || Does history possess directionality?\n2.2 Does history possess directionality?\n\nPhilosophers have raised questions about the meaning and structure of\nthe totality of human history. Some philosophers have sought to\ndiscover a large organizing theme, meaning, or direction in human\nhistory. This may take the form of an effort to demonstrate how\nhistory enacts a divine order, or reveals a large pattern (cyclical,\nteleological, progressive), or plays out an important theme (for\nexample, Hegel\u2019s conception of history as the unfolding of human\nfreedom discussed below). The ambition in each case is to demonstrate\nthat the apparent contingency and arbitrariness of historical events\ncan be related to a more fundamental underlying purpose or order.\n\nThis approach to history may be described as hermeneutic; but it is\nfocused on interpretation of large historical features rather than the\ninterpretation of individual meanings and actions. In effect, it\ntreats the sweep of history as a complicated, tangled text, in which\nthe interpreter assigns meanings to some elements of the story in\norder to fit these elements into the larger themes and motifs of the\nstory. (Ranke makes this point explicitly (1881).)\n\nA recurring current in this approach to the philosophy of history\nfalls in the area of theodicy or eschatology: religiously inspired\nattempts to find meaning and structure in history by relating the past\nand present to some specific, divinely ordained plan. Theologians and\nreligious thinkers have attempted to find meaning in historical events\nas expressions of divine will. One reason for theological interest in\nthis question is the problem of evil; thus Leibniz\u2019s\nTheodicy attempts to provide a logical interpretation of\nhistory that makes the tragedies of history compatible with a\nbenevolent God\u2019s will (1709). In the twentieth century,\ntheologians such as Maritain (1957), Rust (1947), and Dawson (1929)\noffered systematic efforts to provide Christian interpretations of\nhistory.\n\nEnlightenment thinkers rejected the religious interpretation of\nhistory but brought in their own teleology, the idea of\nprogress\u2014the idea that humanity is moving in the direction of\nbetter and more perfect civilization, and that this progression can be\nwitnessed through study of the history of civilization (Condorcet\n1795; Montesquieu 1748). Vico\u2019s philosophy of history seeks to\nidentify a foundational series of stages of human civilization.\nDifferent civilizations go through the same stages, because human\nnature is constant across history (Pompa 1990). Rousseau (1762a;\n1762b) and Kant (1784\u20135; 1784\u20136) brought some of these\nassumptions about rationality and progress into their political\nphilosophies, and Adam Smith embodies some of this optimism about the\nprogressive effects of rationality in his account of the unfolding of\nthe modern European economic system (1776). This effort to derive a\nfixed series of stages as a tool of interpretation of the history of\ncivilization is repeated throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies; it finds expression in Hegel\u2019s philosophy (discussed\nbelow), as well as Marx\u2019s materialist theory of the development\nof economic modes of production (Marx and Engels 1845\u201349; Marx\nand Engels 1848).\n\nThe effort to find directionality or stages in history found a new\nexpression in the early twentieth century, in the hands of several\n\u201cmeta-historians\u201d who sought to provide a\nmacro-interpretation that brought order to world history: Spengler\n(1934), Toynbee (1934), Wittfogel (1935), and Lattimore (1932). These\nauthors offered a reading of world history in terms of the rise and\nfall of civilizations, races, or cultures. Their writings were not\nprimarily inspired by philosophical or theological theories, but they\nwere also not works of primary historical scholarship. Spengler and\nToynbee portrayed human history as a coherent process in which\ncivilizations pass through specific stages of youth, maturity, and\nsenescence. Wittfogel and Lattimore interpreted Asian civilizations in\nterms of large determining factors. Wittfogel contrasts China\u2019s\nhistory with that of Europe by characterizing China\u2019s\ncivilization as one of \u201chydraulic despotism\u201d, with the\nattendant consequence that China\u2019s history was cyclical rather\nthan directional. Lattimore applies the key of geographic and\necological determinism to the development of Asian civilization (Rowe\n2007).\n\nA legitimate criticism of many efforts to offer an interpretation of\nthe sweep of history is the view that it looks for meaning where none\ncan exist. Interpretation of individual actions and life histories is\nintelligible, because we can ground our attributions of meaning in a\ntheory of the individual person as possessing and creating meanings.\nBut there is no super-agent lying behind historical events\u2014for\nexample, the French Revolution\u2014and so it is a metaphysical\nmistake to attempt to find the meaning of the features of the event\n(e.g., the Terror). The theological approach purports to evade this\ncriticism by attributing agency to God as the author of history, but\nthe assumption that there is a divine author of history takes the\nmaking of history out of the hands of humanity.\n\nEfforts to discern large stages in history such as those of Vico,\nSpengler, or Toynbee are vulnerable to a different criticism based on\ntheir mono-causal interpretations of the full complexity of human\nhistory. These authors single out one factor that is thought to drive\nhistory: a universal human nature (Vico), or a common set of\ncivilizational challenges (Spengler, Toynbee). But their hypotheses\nneed to be evaluated on the basis of concrete historical evidence. And\nthe evidence concerning the large features of historical change over\nthe past three millennia offers little support for the idea of one\nfixed process of civilizational development. Instead, human history,\nat virtually every scale, appears to embody a large degree of\ncontingency and multiple pathways of development. This is not to say\nthat there are no credible \u201clarge historical\u201d\ninterpretations available for human history and society. For example,\nMichael Mann\u2019s sociology of early agrarian civilizations (1986),\nDe Vries and Goudsblom\u2019s efforts at global environmental history\n(2002), and Jared Diamond\u2019s treatment of disease and warfare\n(1997) offer examples of scholars who attempt to explain some large\nfeatures of human history on the basis of a few common human\ncircumstances: the efforts of states to collect revenues, the need of\nhuman communities to exploit resources, or the global transmission of\ndisease. The challenge for macro-history is to preserve the discipline\nof empirical evaluation for the large hypotheses that are put\nforward.\n",
