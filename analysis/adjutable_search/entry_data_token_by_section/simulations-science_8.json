The Epistemology of Computer Simulations\n\n\nAs computer simulation methods have gained importance in more and\nmore disciplines, the issue of their trustworthiness for generating new\nknowledge has grown, especially when simulations are expected to be\ncounted as epistemic peers with experiments and traditional analytic\ntheoretical methods. The relevant question is always whether or not the\nresults of a particular computer simulation are accurate enough for\ntheir intended purpose. If a simulation is being used to\nforecast weather, does it predict the variables we are\ninterested in to a degree of accuracy that is sufficient to meet the\nneeds of its consumers? If a simulation of the atmosphere above a\nMidwestern plain is being used to understand the structure of\na severe thunderstorm, do we have confidence that the structures in the\nflow\u2014the ones that will play an explanatory role in our account of why\nthe storm sometimes splits in two, or why it sometimes forms\ntornados\u2014are being depicted accurately enough to support our\nconfidence in the explanation? If a simulation is being used in\nengineering and design, are the predictions made by the simulation\nreliable enough to sanction a particular choice of design parameters,\nor to sanction our belief that a particular design of airplane wing\nwill function? Assuming that the answer to these questions is sometimes\n\u201cyes\u201d, i.e. that these kinds of inferences are at least\nsometimes justified, the central philosophical question is: what\njustifies them? More generally, how can the claim that a simulation is\ngood enough for its intended purpose be evaluated? These are the\ncentral questions of the epistemology of computer simulation\n(EOCS).\n\n\nGiven that confirmation theory is one of the traditional\ntopics in philosophy of science, it might seem obvious that the\nlatter would have the resources to begin to approach these questions.\nWinsberg (1999), however, argued that when it comes to topics related\nto the credentialing of knowledge claims, philosophy of science has\ntraditionally concerned itself with the justification of theories, not\ntheir application. Most simulation, on the other hand, to the extent\nthat it makes use of the theory, tends to make use of the\nwell-established theory. EOCS, in other words, is rarely about testing\nthe basic theories that may go into the simulation, and most often\nabout establishing the credibility of the hypotheses that are, in part,\nthe result of applications of those theories.\n",
