    "main_text": "One Object or Two? || Langton and non-identity\n5.2 Langton and non-identity\n\nLangton\u2019s view can be interpreted as either an identity reading\nor a non-identity reading. The difference is somewhat subtle, but it\nhas important consequences. On the identity version of Langton (1998),\nto talk about things in themselves is to predicate intrinsic\nproperties of substances, while to talk about phenomena is to\npredicate extrinsic properties of those very substances. On\nthe non-identity version of Langton (1998), phenomena are numerically\nidentical to those extrinsic properties. This would be a non-identity\nreading because substances are not identical to their properties\n(either extrinsic or intrinsic). By contrast, on the identity reading,\nan expression for a phenomenon refers to a substance. The\ndifference between these readings can be illustrated by how they give\ntruth-conditions for the judgment that some phenomenon x has\nproperty F:\n\n(Identity) x has F = F is among\nthe extrinsic properties of x\n\n(Non-Identity) x has F = x, an\nextrinsic property of some substance y (\u2260x), has\nF\n\nWhile Langton initially explains her view in a way that suggests an\nidentity reading, she in fact opts for a non-identity reading, for\ngood reason. Firstly, on the identity reading Kant would have to\nidentify subjects of predication in empirical judgments with\nsubstances. This is problematic because it would bring substances into\nthe world of space and time. For instance, if I can make a judgment\nabout this table, then it would be a judgment about the extrinsic\nproperties of this table, and this table would be a substance with\nintrinsic properties (although being a table would, presumably, not be\none of them). Alternately, if we identify the table as a collection of\nextrinsic properties of substances, then we can go on to predicate\nfurther properties of the table, without having to identify the\nsubstance or substances of which the table is ultimately\n predicated.[60]\n",
