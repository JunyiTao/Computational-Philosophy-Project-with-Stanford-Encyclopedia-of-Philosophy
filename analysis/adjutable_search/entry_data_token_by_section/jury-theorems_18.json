Deliberation reduces\nunconditional judgmental independence, by adding common\nsources of votes; see\n Section 3.4\n and\n Figure 4.[18]\n Thus, deliberation further undermines Condorcet\u2019s (naive)\nUnconditional Independence axiom. But deliberation does not undermine\nthe Conditional Independence axiom of the Conditional and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem, provided one conditionalises on\ncommon\n causes.[19]\n\nTurning to the second intuition, deliberation certainly affects\ncompetence. Since deliberation tends to widen the basis of judgments\n(see again\n Section 3.4),\n the effect on competence tends to be positive, as one may conjecture.\nAll three competence axioms considered in\n Section 2\n would then hold more easily with deliberation than without. This\nconjecture is illustrated in\n Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Three examples where\ndeliberation improves competence. Grey: pre-deliberation. Black:\npost-deliberation. [An\n extended description of Figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nPlots a, b and c refer to the competence axiom of Condorcet\u2019s,\nthe Conditional, and the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem,\nrespectively. In all three plots, the competence axiom is violated\npre-deliberation, and holds post-deliberation\u2014 an extreme\nexample where deliberation is of vital importance. In Plot a,\ndeliberation lets general competence \\(P(R_{i})\\) move from 0.4 to 0.8\npost-deliberation, so that Condorcet\u2019s competence axiom UC\nbecomes satisfied. In Plots b and c, the distribution of specific\ncompetence across facts moves upwards, making the respective\ncompetence axiom satisfied.\n\nTo be clear, deliberation sometimes distorts judgments. Sometimes\nmisleading evidence and other judgment-deteriorating sources are\nshared, opinion cascades occur, bad opinion leaders emerge, etc.\n(e.g., Sunstein & Hastie 2014). So the hypothesis that\ndeliberation improves competence should be qualified: deliberation\nusually improves judgments, thereby helping competence axioms\nlike UC, CC and TC become satisfied.\n",
