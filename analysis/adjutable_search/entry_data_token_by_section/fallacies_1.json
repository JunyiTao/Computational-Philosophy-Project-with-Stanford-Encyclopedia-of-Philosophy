    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Aristotle\n2.1 Aristotle\n\nThe history of the study of fallacies begins with Aristotle\u2019s\nwork, On Sophistical Refutations. It is among his earlier\nwritings and the work appears to be a continuation of the\nTopics, his treatise on dialectical argumentation. Although\nhis most extensive and theoretically detailed discussion of fallacies\nis in the Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle also discusses\nfallacies in the Prior Analytics and On Rhetoric.\nHere we will concentrate on summarizing the account given in the\nSophistical Refutations. In that work, four things are worth\nnoting: (a) the different conceptions of fallacy; (b) the basic\nconcepts used to explain fallacies; (c) Aristotle\u2019s explanation\nof why fallacies can be deceptive; and (d) his enumeration and\nclassification of fallacies.\n2.1.1 Definitions\n\nAt the beginning of Topics (I, i), Aristotle distinguishes\nseveral kinds of deductions (syllogisms). They are distinguished first\non the basis of the status of their premises. (1) Those that begin\nfrom true and primary premises, or are owed to such, are\ndemonstrations. (2) Those which have dialectical\npremises\u2014propositions acceptable to most people, or to the\nwise\u2014are dialectical deductions. (3) Deductions that start from\npremises which only appear to be dialectical, are fallacious\ndeductions because of their starting points, as are (4) those\n\u201cdeductions\u201d that do have dialectical premises but do not\nreally necessitate their conclusions. Other fallacies mentioned and\nassociated with demonstrations are (5) those which only appear to\nstart from what is true and primary (Top., I, i 101a5). What\nthis classification leaves out are (6) the arguments that do start\nfrom true and primary premises but then fail to necessitate their\nconclusions; two of these, begging the question and non-cause are\ndiscussed in Prior Analytics (II, 16, 17). It is the\n\u201cfallacious deductions\u201d characterized in (4), however,\nthat come closest to the focus of the Sophistical\nRefutations. Nevertheless, in many of the examples given what\nstands out is that the premises are given as answers in dialogue and\nare to be maintained by the answerer, not necessarily that they are\ndialectical in the sense of being common opinions. This variation on\ndialectical deductions Aristotle calls examination arguments\n(SR 2 165b4).\n2.1.2 The basic concepts\n\nThere are three closely related concepts needed to understand\nsophistical refutations. By a deduction (a\n syllogism[3])\n Aristotle meant an argument which satisfies three conditions: it\n\u201cis based on certain statements made in such a way as\nnecessarily to cause the assertion of things other than those\nstatements and as a result of those statements\u201d (SR 1\n165a1\u20132). Thus an argument may fail to be a syllogism in three\ndifferent ways. The premises may fail to necessitate the conclusion,\nthe conclusion may be the same as one of the premises, and the\nconclusion may not be caused by (grounded in) the premises. The\nconcept of a proof underlying Sophistical\nRefutations is similar to what is demanded of demonstrative\nknowledge in Posterior Analytics (I ii 71b20), viz., that the\npremises must be \u201ctrue, primary, immediate, better known than,\nprior to, and causative of the conclusion,\u201d except that the\nfirst three conditions do not apply to deductions in which the\npremises are obtained through questioning. A refutation,\nAristotle says, is \u201ca proof of the contradictory\u201d\n(SR 6, 168a37)\u2014a proof of the proposition which is the\ncontradictory of the thesis maintained by the answerer. In a context\nof someone, S, maintaining a thesis, T, a\ndialectical refutation will consist in asking questions of S,\nand then taking S\u2019s answers and using them as the\npremises of a proof via a deduction of not-T: this will be a\nrefutation of T relative to the answerer (SR 8\n170a13). The concept of contradiction can be found in\nCategories: it is those contraries which are related such\nthat \u201cone opposite needs must be true, while the other must\nalways be false\u201d (13b2\u20133). A refutation will be\nsophistical if either the proof is only an apparent proof or the\ncontradiction is only an apparent contradiction. Either way, according\nto Aristotle, there is a fallacy. Hence, the opening of his treatise:\n\u201cLet us now treat of sophistical refutations, that is, arguments\nwhich appear to be refutations but are really fallacies and not\nrefutations\u201d (SR 1 164a20).\n2.1.3 The appearance condition\n\nAristotle observed that \u201creasoning and refutation are sometimes\nreal and sometimes not, but appear to be real owing to men\u2019s\ninexperience; for the inexperienced are like those who view things\nfrom a distance\u201d (SR, 1 164b25). The ideas here are\nfirst that there are arguments that appear to be better than they\nreally are; and second that people inexperienced in arguments may\nmistake the appearance for the reality and thus be taken in by a bad\nargument or refutation. Apparent refutations are primarily explained\nin terms of apparent deductions: thus, with one exception,\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies are in the main a catalogue of bad\ndeductions that appear to be good deductions. The exception is\nignoratio elenchi in which, in one of its guises, the\ndeduction contains no fallacy but the conclusion proved only appears\nto contradict the answerer\u2019s thesis.\n\nAristotle devotes considerable space to explaining how the appearance\ncondition may arise. At the outset he mentions the argument that turns\nupon names (SR 1 165a6), saying that it is the most prolific\nand usual explanation: because there are more things than names, some\nnames will have to denote more than one thing, thereby creating the\npossibility of ambiguous terms and expressions. That the ambiguous use\nof a term goes unnoticed allows the illusion that an argument is a\nreal deduction. The explanation of how the false appearance can arise\nis in the similarity of words or expressions with different meanings,\nand the smallness of differences in meaning between some expressions\n(SR 7 169a23\u2013169b17).\n2.1.4 List and classification\n\nAristotle discusses thirteen ways in which refutations can be\nsophistical and divides them into two groups. The first group,\nintroduced in Chapter 4 of On Sophistical Refutations,\nincludes those Aristotle considers dependent on language (in\ndictione), and the second group, introduced in Chapter 5,\nincludes those characterized as not being dependent on language\n(extra dictionem). Chapter 6 reviews all the fallacies from\nthe view point of failed refutations, and Chapter 7 explains how the\nappearance of correctness is made possible for each fallacy. Chapters\n19\u201330 advise answerers on how to avoid being taken in by\nsophistical refutations.\n\nThe fallacies dependent on language are equivocation, amphiboly,\ncombination of words, division of words, accent and form of\nexpression. Of these the first two have survived pretty much as\nAristotle thought of them. Equivocation results from the exploitation\nof a term\u2019s ambiguity and amphiboly comes about through\nindefinite grammatical structure. The one has to do with semantical\nambiguity, the other with syntactical ambiguity. However, the way that\nAristotle thought of the combination and division fallacies differs\nsignificantly from modern treatments of composition and division.\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies are the combinations and divisions of\nwords which alter meanings, e.g., \u201cwalk while sitting\u201d vs.\n\u201cwalk-while-sitting,\u201d (i.e., to have the ability to walk\nwhile seated vs. being able to walk and sit at the same time). For\ndivision, Aristotle gives the example of the number 5: it is 2 and 3.\nBut 2 is even and 3 is odd, so 5 is even and odd. Double meaning is\nalso possible with those words whose meanings depend on how they are\npronounced, this is the fallacy of accent, but there were no accents\nin written Greek in Aristotle\u2019s day; accordingly, this fallacy\nwould be more likely in written work. What Aristotle had in mind is\nsomething similar to the double meanings that can be given to\n\u2018unionized\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 depending on how\nthey are pronounced. Finally, the fallacy that Aristotle calls form of\nexpression exploits the kind of ambiguity made possible by what we\nhave come to call category mistakes, in this case, fitting words to\nthe wrong categories. Aristotle\u2019s example is the word\n\u2018flourishing\u2019 which may appear to be a verb because of its\n\u2018ing\u2019 ending (as in \u2018cutting\u2019 or\n\u2018running\u2019) and so belongs to the category of actions,\nwhereas it really belongs in the category of quality. Category\nconfusion was, for Aristotle, the key cause of metaphysical\nmistakes.\n\nThere are seven kinds of sophistical refutation that can occur in the\ncategory of refutations not dependent on language: accident,\nsecundum quid, consequent, non-cause, begging the question,\nignoratio elenchi and many questions.\n\nThe fallacy of accident is the most elusive of the fallacies on\nAristotle\u2019s list. It turns on his distinction between two kinds\nof predication, unique properties and accidents (Top. I 5).\nThe fallacy is defined as occurring when \u201cit is claimed that\nsome attribute belongs similarly to the thing and to its\naccident\u201d (SR 5 166b28). What belongs to a thing are\nits unique properties which are counterpredicable (Smith 1997, 60),\ni.e., if \\(A\\) is an attribute of \\(B\\), \\(B\\) is an attribute of\n\\(A\\). However, attributes that are accidents are not\ncounterpredicates and to treat them as such is false reasoning, and\ncan lead to paradoxical results; for example, if it is a property of\ntriangles that they are equal to two right angles, and a triangle is\naccidentally a first principle, it does not follow that all first\nprinciples have two right angles (see Schreiber 2001, ch. 7).\n\nAristotle considers the fallacy of consequent to be a special case of\nthe fallacy of accident, observing that consequence is not\nconvertible, i.e., \u201cif \\(A\\) is, \\(B\\) necessarily is, men also\nfancy that, if \\(B\\) is, \\(A\\) necessarily is\u201d (SR 5\n169b3). One of Aristotle\u2019s examples is that it does not follow\nthat \u201ca man who is hot must be in a fever because a man who is\nin a fever is hot\u201d (SR 5 169b19). This fallacy is\nsometimes claimed as being an early statement of the formal fallacy of\naffirming the consequent.\n\nThe fallacy of secundum quid comes about from failing to\nappreciate the distinction between using words absolutely and using\nthem with qualification. Spruce trees, for example, are green with\nrespect to their foliage (they are \u2018green\u2019 with\nqualification); it would be a mistake to infer that they are green\nabsolutely because they have brown trunks and branches. It is because\nthe difference between using words absolutely and with qualification\ncan be minute that this fallacy is possible, thinks Aristotle.\n\nBegging the question is explained as asking for the answer (the\nproposition) which one is supposed to prove, in order to avoid having\nto make a proof of it. Some subtlety is needed to bring about this\nfallacy such as a clever use of synonymy or an intermixing of\nparticular and universal propositions (Top. VIII, 13). If the\nfallacy succeeds the result is that there will be no deduction:\nbegging the question and non-cause are directly prohibited by the\nsecond and third conditions respectively of being a deduction\n(SR 6 168b23).\n\nThe fallacy of non-cause occurs in contexts of ad impossibile\narguments when one of the assumed premises is superfluous for deducing\nthe conclusion. The superfluous premise will then not be a factor in\ndeducing the conclusion and it will be a mistake to infer that it is\nfalse since it is a non-cause of the impossibility. This is not the\nsame fallacy mentioned by Aristotle in the Rhetoric (II 24)\nwhich is more akin to a fallacy of empirical causation and is better\ncalled false cause (see Woods and Hansen 2001).\n\nAristotle\u2019s fallacy of many questions occurs when two questions\nare asked as if they are one proposition. A proposition is \u201ca\nsingle predication about a single subject\u201d (SR 6\n169a8). Thus with a single answer to two questions one has two\npremises for a refutation , and one of them may turn out to be idle,\nthus invalidating the deduction (it becomes a non-cause fallacy). Also\npossible is that extra-linguistic part-whole mistakes may happen when,\nfor example, given that something is partly good and partly not-good,\nthe double question is asked whether it is all good or all not-good?\nEither answer will lead to a contradiction (see Schreiber 2000,\n156\u201359). Despite its name, this fallacy consists in the ensuing\ndeduction, not in the question which merely triggers the fallacy.\n\nOn one interpretation ignoratio elenchi is considered to be\nAristotle\u2019s thirteenth fallacy, in which an otherwise successful\ndeduction fails to end with the required contradictory of the\nanswerer\u2019s thesis. Seen this way, ignoratio elenchi is\nunlike all the other fallacies in that it is not an argument that\nfails to meet one of the criteria of a good deduction, but a genuine\ndeduction that turns out to be irrelevant to the point at issue. On\nanother reading, ignoratio elenchi is not a separate fallacy\nbut an alternative to the language dependent / language independent\nway of classifying the other twelve fallacies: they all fail to meet,\nin one way or another, the requirements of a sound refutation.\n\n[A] refutation is a contradiction of one and the same predicate, not\nof a name but of a thing, and not of a synonymous name but of an\nidentical name, based on the given premises and following necessarily\nfrom them (the original point at issue not being included) in the same\nrespect, manner and time. (SR 5 167a23\u201327)\n\n\nEach of the other twelve fallacies is analysed as failing to meet one\nof the conditions in this definition of refutation (SR 6).\nAristotle seems to favour this second reading, but it leaves the\nproblem of explaining how refutations that miss their mark can seem\nlike successful refutations. A possible explanation is that a failure\nto contradict a given thesis can be made explicit by adding the\nnegation of the thesis as a last step of the deduction, thereby\ninsuring the contradiction of the thesis, but only at the cost (by the\nlast step) of introducing one of the other twelve fallacies in the\ndeduction.\n2.1.5 Different interpretations\n\nI have given only the briefest possible explanation of\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies. To really understand them a much longer\nengagement with the original text and the secondary sources is\nnecessary. The second chapter of Hamblin\u2019s (1970) book is a\nuseful introduction to the Sophistical Refutations, and a\ndefence of the dialectical nature of the fallacies. Hamblin thinks\nthat a dialectical framework is indispensable for an understanding of\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies and that part of the poverty of\ncontemporary accounts of fallacies is due to a failure to understand\ntheir assumed dialectical setting. This approach to the fallacies is\ncontinued in contemporary research by some argumentation theorists,\nmost notably Douglas Walton (1995) who also follows Aristotle in\nrecognizing a number of different kinds of dialogues in which\nargumentation can occur; Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (2004)\nwho combine dialectical and pragmatic insights with an ideal model of\na critical discussion; and Jaakko Hintikka who analyses the\nAristotelian fallacies as mistakes in question-dialogues (Hintikka\n1987; Bachman 1995.) According to Hintikka (1997) it is an outright\nmistake to think of Aristotle\u2019s fallacies primarily as mistaken\ninferences, either deductive or inductive. A non-dialogue oriented\ninterpretation of Aristotle fallacies is found in Woods and Hansen\n(1997 and 2001) who argue that the fallacies (apparent deductions) are\nbasic to apparent refutations, and that Aristotle\u2019s interest in\nthe fallacies extended beyond dialectical contests, as is shown by his\ninterest in them in the Prior Analytics and the\nRhetoric (II 24). What gives unity to Aristotle\u2019s\ndifferent fallacies on this view is not a dialogue structure but\nrather their dependence on the concepts of deduction and proof. The\nmost thorough recent study of these questions is in Schreiber (2003),\nwho emphasizes Aristotle\u2019s concern with resolving (exposing)\nfallacies and argues that it is Aristotelian epistemology and\nmetaphysics that is needed for a full understanding of the fallacies\nin the Sophistical Refutations.\n",
