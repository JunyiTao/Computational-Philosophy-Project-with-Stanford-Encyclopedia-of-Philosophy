    "main_text": "\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian\nphilosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or\nSouthwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his\nstudent and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert\n(1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask\n(1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary\nHermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg\nschool of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of\nthe anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in\nGerman academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that\nconstituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in\nthe late nineteenth century.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in\nreformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a\n\u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis\non questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project\nas an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is\nkeen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the\nspecial sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s\nindependence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern\nwith a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti.\nThat is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not\ndetermine matters of fact.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between\nthe \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the\n\u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His\nargument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that\ncaptures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality\nhas been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical\nmethod.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by\npioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in\nterms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a\nchronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the\nformat of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and\nindividual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous\nPr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of\nWindelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of\na philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing,\nand terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the\nnext. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a\nrational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband\ndeveloped in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around\nthe central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to\nmany of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of\nKant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method,\nand the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a\nhighly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his\ntime. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing\nphilosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of\nthe Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his\nideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than\nis often acknowledged.\n",
