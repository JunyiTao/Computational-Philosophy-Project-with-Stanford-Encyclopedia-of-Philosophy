    "main_text": "\n\nThe Church-Turing thesis (or Turing-Church thesis) is a fundamental\nclaim in the theory of computability. It was advanced independently by\nChurch and Turing in the mid 1930s. There are various equivalent\nformulations of the thesis. A common one is that every effective\ncomputation can be carried out by a Turing machine (i.e., by\nTuring\u2019s abstract computing machine, which in its universal form\nencapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the stored-program\nall-purpose digital computer). Modern reimaginings of the\nChurch-Turing thesis transform it, extending it to fundamental\nphysics, complexity theory, exotic algorithms, and cognitive science.\nIt is important to be aware though that some of the theses nowadays\nreferred to as the Church-Turing thesis are at best very\ndistant relatives of the thesis advanced by Church and Turing.\n",
