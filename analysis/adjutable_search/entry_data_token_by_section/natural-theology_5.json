The a posteriori arguments in natural\ntheology that are referred to as \u201cteleological\u201d claim that\nthe natural world displays some sort of purposive or end-directed\ndesign, and that this licenses the conclusion that the natural world\nhas a very powerful and intelligent designer (see the entry on\n teleological arguments for God\u2019s existence).\n Earlier authors dubbed this sort of non-demonstrative, inductive\nargument a \u201cphysico-theological\u201d argument (see, e.g.,\nWilliam Derham 1713). \n\nTeleological arguments can be found in numerous traditions and time\nperiods, including the classical Greek and Roman context (see Sedley\n2008) and the Indian philosophical tradition (see Brown 2008). In the\nwest the argument is primarily associated with William Paley\n(1743\u20131805), although in fact this type of argument was\ndiscussed by numerous early modern figures before him (see Taliaferro\n2005, DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015). The fact that Paley\u2019s 1802 book\nwas called Natural Theology is no doubt part of why natural\ntheology as a whole is sometimes equated with the a\nposteriori investigations of nature for the purposes of\nsupporting religious theses. In the analogy that made Paley\u2019s\nargument famous, the relationship between a watch and a watch-maker is\ntaken to be saliently similar to the relationship between the natural\nworld and its author. If we were to go walking upon the heath and\nstumble upon a watch, a quick examination of its inner workings would\nreveal, with a high probability, that \u201cits several parts were\nframed and put together for a purpose\u201d by what must have been\n\u201can intelligence\u201d (1802: 1\u20136). Likewise with the\nuniverse as a whole. Earlier teleological arguments can be found\nin the works of post-Cartesian atomists like Pierre Gassendi,\nCambridge Platonists like Walter Charleton and Henry More, and\nmechanists like Robert Boyle. Charleton, for instance, argues in his\nThe Darkness of Atheism Dispelled by the Light of Nature: A\nPhysico-Theological Treatise  (1652) that the modern rejection of\nAristotelianism establishes an even greater need to appeal to a\ndesigner to explain how inert atoms under mechanical laws can be\nfashioned into an intelligible and purposive order (see Leech 2013).\n\n\nA different kind of teleological argument is developed by George\nBerkeley (1685\u20131753), for whom natural, physical objects do not\nexist independently of minds, but consist solely in ideas. Given the\nregularity, complexity, and involuntariness of our sensory ideas,\ntheir source (Berkeley argues) must be an infinitely powerful,\nbenevolent mind that produces these ideas in us in a lawlike fashion.\nGod\u2019s existence can also be demonstrated from the harmony and\nbeauty that the ideas of the world display (Berkeley 1710: \u00a7146).\nSince according to Berkeley our ordinary experience is a type of\ndirect divine communication with us, our relationship with God is in\nthis respect especially intimate. Thus he frequently remarks, quoting\nSt. Paul, that \u201cin God we live and move and have our\nbeing\u201d (Acts 17:28).\n3.2.1 Hume on the teleological argument\n\nHume\u2019s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion pre-date\nPaley, of course, but they feature an especially influential and\nelegant critical discussion of teleological arguments (1779), a\ndiscussion of which Paley was no doubt aware. (In fact, Paley may have\nrestyled his argument as an inference-to-best explanation in an effort\nto avoid some of Hume\u2019s criticisms.)\n\nHume\u2019s assault on the teleological argument begins by\nformulating it as follows (compare Pereboom 1996, 2010):\n\nNature is a great machine, composed of lesser machines, all of\nwhich exhibit order (especially adaptation of means to ends).\n[premise]\nMachines caused by human minds exhibit order (especially\nadaptation of means to ends). [premise]\nNature resembles machines caused by human minds. [by (1),\n(2)]\nIf effects resemble each other, their causes resemble each other\nas well. [premise]\nThe cause of nature resembles human minds. [by (3), (4)]\nGreater effects demand greater causes (causes adequate to the\neffects). [premise] \nNature is much greater than machines caused by human minds.\n[premise]\nThe cause of nature resembles but is much greater than human\nminds. [by (5), (6), (7)]\nThe cause of nature is God. [by (8)]\nTherefore, God exists. [by (9)]\n\n\nHume\u2019s objections to this argument include the claims that the\nanalogies on which it is dependent are not exact, and thus that there\nare alternative explanations for order and apparent design in the\nuniverse. One response to these objections is that the teleological\nargument should be conceived as an argument to the best\nexplanation, on the model of many scientific arguments. In that case\nthe analogy need not be exact, but might still show that a theistic\nexplanation is best (and again, Paley himself may have recognized\nthis). Hume, in the voice of his character Philo, concedes\n\n\nthat the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of\nart is evident; and according to all the rules of good reasoning, we\nought to infer, if we argue at all concerning them, that their causes\nhave a proportional analogy. (Part XII)\n\n\nBut Philo also affirms that we cannot infer any important similarities\nbetween humans and the author of nature beyond intelligence, and in\nparticular we cannot infer some of the divine attributes that are most\nimportant for sustaining traditional theistic religion (Part V). Most\nsignificantly, given the evil that there is in the universe, we cannot\nconclude that its designer has the moral qualities traditional\nreligion requires God to have (Part X). Thus, again, we are left with\na rather \u201cmediocre deity\u201d.\n\nOne of Hume\u2019s neglected objections to the teleological argument\nis that it generates an absurd infinite regress (Part IV). If order\nand apparent design in the material universe are explained by divine\nintelligence, what explains the order and apparent design that give\nrise to intelligence in the divine mind? By dint of the reasoning\nemployed in the teleological argument, it would have to be a\nsuper-divine intelligence. But what explains the order and apparent\ndesign that give rise to super-divine intelligence? An absurd infinite\nregress results, and to avoid it one might well suppose the material\nworld \u201ccontain[s] the principle of order within itself\u201d.\n\n\nTo this Hume has the theist Cleanthes reply that\n\n\neven in common life, if I assign a cause for any event, is it any\nobjection that I cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer\nevery new question which may incessantly be started?\n\n\nThis seems right: in scientific theorizing it is no decisive objection\nagainst an explanation that it contains entities that are themselves\nnot fully explained. Crucial to the value of scientific explanations\nis that they supply an explanatory advance, and we can\nreasonably believe that a theory does so without our having in hand\ncomplete explanations for all of the entities it posits. \n3.2.2 The teleological argument from fine-tuning\n\nIn recent decades, some natural theologians have developed an\ninductive argument for the existence of God that appeals to the fact\nthat the fundamental features of the universe are fine-tuned for the\nexistence of life. According to many physicists, the fact that the\nuniverse can support life depends delicately on various of its\nfundamental characteristics, notably the values of certain constants\nof nature, the specific character of certain fundamental laws, and\naspects of the universe\u2019s conditions in its very early stages.\nThe core claim of the argument is that without an intelligent\ndesigner, it would be improbable that the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions were fine-tuned for life.\n\nWilliam Lane Craig (see e.g., Craig 1990, 2003) develops a version of\nthis argument, which proceeds as follows. The world is conditioned\nprincipally by the values of the fundamental constants:\n\na: the fine structure constant, or electromagnetic\ninteraction;\nmn/me: proton to electron mass ratio; \naG: gravitation;\naw: the weak force; and\nas: the strong force.\n\n\nWhen one imagines these constants being different, one discovers that\nin fact the number of observable universes, that is to say, universes\ncapable of supporting intelligent life, is very small. Just a slight\nvariation in any one of these values would render life impossible. For\nexample, if the strong force (as) were increased as much as\n1%, nuclear resonance levels would be so altered that almost all\ncarbon would be burned into oxygen; an increase of 2% would preclude\nformation of protons out of quarks, preventing the existence of atoms.\nFurthermore, weakening the strong force by as much as 5% would unbind\ndeuteron, which is essential to stellar nucleosynthesis, leading to a\nuniverse composed only of hydrogen. It has been estimated that the\nstrong force must be within 0.8 and 1.2 its actual strength or all\nelements of atomic weight greater than four would not have formed. Or\nagain, if the weak force had been appreciably stronger, then the Big\nBang\u2019s nuclear burning would have proceeded past helium to iron,\nmaking fusion-powered stars impossible. But if it had been much\nweaker, then we should have had a universe entirely of helium. Or\nagain, if gravitation aG had been a little greater, all stars\nwould have been red dwarfs, which are too cold to support life-bearing\nplanets. If it had been a little smaller, the universe would have been\ncomposed exclusively of blue giants, which burn too briefly for life\nto develop. This gives us reason to believe that there is an\nintelligent designer who fine-tuned the universe as we actually find\nit.\n\nThe debate surrounding the fine-tuning argument is technically complex\n(a detailed summary is available in the entry on\n fine-tuning).\n Here we discuss some of the most pressing issues.\n\nAs noted, a core claim of the argument as widely understood is that\nthe fine-tuning for life of the constants, laws, and initial\nconditions would be deeply improbable without an intelligent designer\nof the universe. One question concerns the notion of probability at\nwork in this claim. Contemporary accounts usually appeal to an\nepistemic notion of probability (e.g., Monton 2006), by contrast with\nphysical and logical alternatives. On this reading, the core claim is\nthat fine-tuning for life without an intelligent designer is\nimprobable in the sense that we should not expect it without such a\nbeing, or that without such a being we should be surprised that there\nis such fine-tuning.\n\nGiven this understanding of the core improbability claim, some critics\n(e.g., Carlson and Olsson 1998) have argued that the fine-tuning at\nissue requires no explanation. Any specific sequence of heads and\ntails in a long series of coin tosses is improbable in this sense;\nthat is, any one sequence would be one we wouldn\u2019t and\nshouldn\u2019t expect. But no specific sequence requires an\nexplanation other than that it was randomly generated. So why should\nthe finely-tuned actual array of constants, laws, and initial\nconditions require an explanation other than an appeal to randomness?\nMany, however, disagree, and argue that the availability of\nexplanatory hypotheses with intuitive pull, such as an intelligent\ndesigner or a multiverse (discussed below), indicates that a more\nsubstantive explanation for fine-tuning is required (e.g., Leslie\n1989).\n\nA number of critics press the objection that we should not be\nsurprised that we observe features of the universe that are required\nfor our own existence. If the constants, laws, and initial conditions\nwere incompatible with our existence, we would not be here to observe\nthis. In Elliot Sober\u2019s (2003) analysis, what\u2019s at work\nhere is the observer selection effect, which tends to result in a\ncertain bias. In this case, our observations are biased toward\nfine-tuning because we would not have existed to make these\nobservations had the universe not been fine-tuned for life. But any\nbias resulting from an observer selection effect should be factored\nout and set aside, and this is so for the fine-tuning at issue.\n\nCritics of this line of reasoning cite examples in which it appears to\ngoes awry. In John Leslie\u2019s (1989) example, you are dragged\nbefore a firing squad of 100 trained marksmen. The command is given;\nyou hear the deafening sound of the guns. But then there you are,\nsurprised to be observing the aftermath, and that you are still alive.\nNow consider the hypothesis that the marksmen intended to miss, which\nseems a reasonable option for explaining why you\u2019re still alive.\nBut notice that this case features an observation selection effect\nanalogous to the one Sober proposes for fine-tuning: you can\u2019t\nobserve the aftermath unless you survive the firing squad. On\nSober\u2019s recommendation, observation selection effects should be\nfactored out and set aside. But on this recommendation your still\nbeing alive wouldn\u2019t require an explanation, and we\nwouldn\u2019t have reason to accept the explanation that the marksmen\nintended to miss. So, according to the critics, there must be\nsomething wrong with Sober\u2019s analysis. Leslie contends you\nshould in fact be surprised that you observe that you are still alive.\nThat you are alive is in the relevant sense epistemically improbable,\nand requires an explanation. Similarly, we should be surprised that we\nobserve that the universe is fine-tuned for life, and this also\nrequires an explanation. One way to account for Leslie\u2019s\ncontention is that the epistemic probability of fine-tuning should be\njudged from the point of view of a reasoner who brackets or sets aside\nthat she is alive (and that there is any life at all), and then asks\nwhether we should expect that the universe is fine-tuned for life, or\nwhether this should be surprising (see Howson 1991, Collins 2009, and\nKotzen 2012 for views of this sort). Similarly, in the firing-squad\ncase, I should judge whether my surviving is epistemically probable\nfrom a point of view in which I bracket or set aside that I am still\nalive, and then ask whether I should expect that I am still alive or\nwhether this should be surprising.\n\n\nLeslie (1989) proposes that the hypothesis of multiple universes,\ni.e., of the multiverse, would provide an explanation for fine-tuning\nfor life. Here is his analogy (which involves guns again, oddly). You\nare alone at night in an extremely dark forest when a gun is fired\nfrom far away and you are hit. If you assume that there is no one out\nto get you, this would be surprising. But now suppose that you were\nnot in fact alone, but instead part of a large crowd (which you do not\nsee because it\u2019s so dark). In that case, Leslie suggests, you\nwould be less surprised at being shot, since it seems at least\nsomewhat likely that a gunman would be trying to shoot someone in the\ncrowd. Leslie suggests that this story supports the multiverse\nexplanation for the universe being fine-tuned for life.\n\nRoger White (2000) contends that there is a problem with\nLeslie\u2019s account. While the multiverse hypothesis would explain\nwhy there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned for\nlife, since it would raise the probability of that hypothesis, it\nwould not similarly explain why this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. He contends that supposing that the gunman was firing at\nrandom, being part of a large crowd explains\u2014raises the\nprobability\u2014that someone or other is shot, but\nnot that you are shot. By contrast, the hypothesis that the\ngunman was aiming at you, as opposed to firing at random, does explain\nin this way that you are shot. Similarly, the multiverse hypothesis\nexplains that there is some universe or other that is fine-tuned\nfor life, but not that this universe is fine-tuned for\nlife. By contrast, in White\u2019s view the hypothesis of an\nintelligent designer does explain why\u2014raises the\nprobability\u2014that this universe is fine-tuned for life. White\nargues:\n\n\nPostulate as many other universes as you wish, they do not make it any\nmore likely that ours should be life-permitting or that we should be\nhere. So our good fortune to exist in a life-permitting universe gives\nus no reason to suppose that there are many universes (White 2000:\n274; see Rota 2005 for another theistic response to the multiverse\nhypothesis).\n See the\n fine-tuning\n entry for more detail on this exchange, and on other issues raised in\nthe debate.\n\n3.3 Arguments from religious experience\n\nArguments for the existence of God from a special kind of experience\nare often called \u201carguments from religious experience\u201d.\nSome philosophers and theologians have argued that our ordinary human\ncognitive faculties include what John Calvin called a special\n\u201csense of divinity\u201d that, when not impeded or blocked,\nwill deliver immediately justified beliefs about supernatural entities\n(Plantinga 1981, 1984). Some such thinkers, then, might construe an\nargument from religious experience as belonging to the category of\nnatural religion or natural theology. Others, however, insist that\n\u201ccharacteristic of the Continental Calvinist tradition is a\nrevulsion against arguments in favor of theism or Christianity\u201d\n(Wolterstorff 1984: 7; see also Sudduth 2009). In any case, most\nauthors who write about religious experience generally construe it as\ncaused by something other than our ordinary faculties and their\nintersubjectively available objects, and thus do not think of it as\none of the topics of natural theology (see Davis 1989, Alston 1991,\nKwan 2006).\n\nSee the entry on\n religious experience\n for expansive discussion of this issue.\n4. \u201cRamified\u201d Natural Theology\n\nSome supporters of natural religion or natural theology seek to use\nour ordinary cognitive faculties to support theses that are more\nrobust and specific than those of generic or\n\u201cperfect-being\u201d theism. This project has recently been\ndubbed \u201cramified\u201d natural theology by Richard Swinburne\n(see Holder 2013). A few of these efforts involve a priori\nargumentation: an ancient argument for the Trinity (found in St.\nAugustine (De Trinitate, c. 399\u2013419, Book IX), and\nRichard of St. Victor (De Trinitate, c. 1162\u20131173,\nIII.1\u201325)) is that any supreme being would have to be a\nsupremely loving being, and any omnipotent supremely loving being\nwould ultimately have to emanate from itself something that is both\nother and yet just as supreme and lovable as itself, and that a third\nsuch person would be necessary as a kind of product of that love\nbetween the first two. Marilyn McCord Adams\u2019s books on theodicy\n(Adams 2000, 2006) and Eleonore Stump\u2019s Gifford Lectures (Stump\n2010) constitute an effort to consider the a priori problem\nof evil from within the context of a ramified (and thus in this case\nmore robustly Christian) kind of natural theology.\n\nBut most ramified natural theology is inductive in spirit: thus Hugo\nGrotius divides his De veritate religionis Christianae (1627)\ninto a first book that deals with classical natural theology but then\nlater books that deal specifically with the truth of Christianity.\nJohn Locke (1695) argued for the \u201cReasonableness of\nChristianity\u201d using a broadly historical, probabilistic\napproach. William Paley (1794) further developed this approach, and\nmuch more recently Swinburne argued for the conclusion that\nBayesian-style reasoning justifies belief in the resurrection of Jesus\nwith a probability of 97% (Swinburne 2003). Numerous other\nphilosophers (and also many natural scientists) appeal to historical\nand scientific data as well as empirical and statistical principles of\nreasoning to support the authenticity of various biblical claims, the\nprobability of various miracle stories, and so forth (see e.g., Olding\n1990; Polkinghorne 2009; Gauch Jr. 2011). Note that this is a way of\nappealing to the content of sacred texts and special revelation which\nis consistent with the methods of natural theology: the prophetic or\nhistorical claims of those texts are evaluated using public evidence\nand accepted canons of inductive reasoning. Still, even optimistic\nnatural theologians like Locke, Paley, Swinburne, and these others\ncount as hybridists insofar as they think there are some important\ndoctrines about the divine that cannot be justified by our natural\ncognitive faculties. Thus even they will at some point be willing (in\nKant\u2019s famous phrase) to \u201cdeny knowledge in order to leave\nroom for faith\u201d (1787, Bxxx).",
