Axiomatics perfected\n\n\nAccording to Aristotle, scientific knowledge (episteme) must\nbe expressed in statements that follow deductively from a finite list\nof self-evident statements (axioms) and only employ terms defined from\na finite list of self-understood terms (primitives). For over two\nmillennia it was generally assumed that Aristotle's ideal is actually\nrealized in Euclid's Elements. As a matter of fact, there is a\nlogical gap already in Euclid I.1 (the solution of this problem rests\non an unstated assumption of continuity) and it is not clear that\nEuclid regarded his postulates as self-evident (by calling them\n\u2018requests\u2019 he suggested he did not). The idea of securing\nknowledge by logical deduction from unquestionable principles had a\npowerful fascination for modern scientists such as Galileo and Newton,\nboth of whom fondly practised axiomatics, at any rate as a literary\nform, like Spinoza in his Ethics. Still, a truly satisfactory\nand, if one may say so, serious instance of axiomatization of a branch\nof knowledge was not available in print until 1882, when Moritz Pasch\n(b.\u00a01843, d.\u00a01930) published his Lectures on Modern\nGeometry. \n\n\nPasch viewed geometry as a natural science, whose successful\nutilization by other sciences and in practical life rests \u201cexclusively\non the fact that geometrical concepts originally agreed exactly with\nempirical objects\u201d (Pasch 1882, p. iii). Geometry distinguishes itself\nfrom other natural sciences because it obtains only very few concepts\nand laws directly from experience, and aims at obtaining from them the\nlaws of more complex phenomena by purely deductive means. The empirical\nfoundation of geometry was encapsulated by Pasch in a core of basic\nconcepts and basic statements or axioms. The basic concepts refer to\nthe shape and size of bodies and their positions relative to one\nanother. They are not defined, for no definition could replace the\n\u201cexhibition of appropriate natural objects,\u201d which is the only road to\nunderstanding such simple, irreducible notions (ibid., p. 16). All\nother geometric concepts must be ultimately defined in terms of the\nbasic ones. The basic concepts are connected to one another by the\naxioms, which \u201cstate what has been observed in certain very simple\ndiagrams\u201d (p. 43). All other geometric statements must be proved from\nthe axioms by the strictest deductive methods. Everything that is\nneeded to prove them must be recorded, without exception, in the\naxioms. These must therefore embody the whole empirical material\nelaborated by geometry, so that \u201cafter they are established it is no\nlonger necessary to resort to sense perceptions\u201d (p. 17). \u201cEvery\nconclusion which occurs in a proof must find its confirmation in the\ndiagram, but it is not justified by the diagram, but by a definite\nearlier statement (or definition)\u201d (p. 43). Pasch understood clearly\nthe implications of his method. He writes (p. 98):\nIf geometry is to be truly deductive, the process of\ninference must be independent in all its parts from the\nmeaning of the geometric concepts, just as it must be\nindependent from the diagrams. All that need be considered are the\nrelations between the geometric concepts, recorded in the\nstatements and definitions. In the course of deduction it is both\npermitted and useful to bear in mind the meaning of the geometric\nconcepts that occur in it, but it is not at all necessary.\nIndeed, when it actually beomes necessary, this shows that there is a\ngap in the proof, and\u2014if the gap cannot be eliminated by\nmodifying the argument\u2014that the premises are too weak to support\nit.\n\n\nPasch's Lectures on Modern Geometry dealt with projective\ngeometry. The first axiomatization of Euclidean geometry that was up to\nPasch's standards\u2014Foundations of Geometry by David\nHilbert (b.\u00a01862, d.\u00a01943)\u2014appeared in 1899 and\nexercised enormous influence on twentieth century mathematics and\nphilosophy. Hilbert invites the reader to consider three arbitrary\ncollections of objects, which he calls \u2018points\u2019,\n\u2018straight lines\u2019 and \u2018planes\u2019, and five\nundefined relations between (i) a point and a straight line, (ii) a\nstraight line and a plane, (iii) three points, (iv) two pairs of points\n(\u2018segments\u2019) and (v) two equivalence classes of point\ntriples (\u2018angles\u2019). The conditions prescribed in Hilbert's\n20 axioms\u2014including the Axiom of Completeness added in the second\nedition\u2014are sufficient to characterize the said objects and\nrelations up to isomorphism. Isomorphism\u2014i.e., structural\nequivalence\u2014can hold, however, between different, intuitively\ndisparate, systems of objects. Hilbert availed himself of this feature\nof axiomatic theories for studying the independence of some axioms from\nthe rest. To prove it he proposed actual instances (models) of the\nstructure determined by all axioms but one, plus the negation of the\nomitted one. Frege complained that the geometric axioms retained in\nthese exercises could be applied to Hilbert's far-fetched models only\nby tampering with the natural meaning of words (cf. Alice's\nconversation with Humpty Dumpty). Hilbert replied on 29 December 1899: \nEvery theory is only a scaffolding or schema of concepts\ntogether with their necessary mutual relations, and the basic elements\ncan be conceived in any way you wish. If I take for my points any\nsystem of things, for example, the system love, law, chimney-sweep,\n\u2026 and I just assume all my axioms as relations between these\nthings, my theorems\u2014for example, the theorem of\nPythagoras\u2014also hold of these things. \u2026 This feature of\ntheories can never be a shortcoming and is in any case\ninevitable.\n\n\nAll this follows, of course, from the very nature of axiomatics, as\nexplained in the passage quoted from Pasch. Indeed, such\ntruth-preserving semantic permutations were no news in geometry after\nGergonne (1771\u20131859) drew attention in 1825 to the following\nprinciple of duality: Any true statement of projective plane\ngeometry gives rise to another, equally true, dual statement obtained\nby substituting \u2018point\u2019 for \u2018line\u2019,\n\u2018collinear\u2019 for \u2018concurrent\u2019,\n\u2018meet\u2019 for \u2018join\u2019, and vice versa, wherever\nthese words occur in the former. (In projective space geometry, duality\nholds for points and planes.) The same result is secured, of course, by\nexchanging not the words, but their meanings. \n",
