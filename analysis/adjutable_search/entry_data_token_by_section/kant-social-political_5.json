    "main_text": "Punishment\n7. Punishment\n\nKant was long considered to be an exemplar of the retributivist theory\nof punishment. While he does claim that the only proper justification\nof punishment is guilt for a crime, he does not limit the usefulness\nof punishment to retributivist matters. Punishment can have as its\njustification only the guilt of the criminal. All other uses of\npunishment, such as rehabilitation (the alleged good of the criminal)\nor deterrence (alleged good to society) uses the criminal merely as a\nmeans (6:331). Once this guilt is determined, however, Kant does not\ndeny that something useful can be drawn from the punishment. In the\nFeyerabend lectures on Natural Right, Kant is clear that the sovereign\n\u201cmust punish in order to obtain security\u201d, and even while\nusing the law of retribution, \u201cin such a way the best security\nis obtained\u201d (27:1390\u201391). The state is authorized to use\nits coercive force to defend freedom against limitations to freedom;\nmore particularly, since right does not entail that citizens must\nlimit their own freedom but only that \u201cfreedom is limited\u201d\nby conditions of right, it is right for another, i.e. the state, to\nactively limit citizens\u2019 freedom in accord with right (6:231).\nThe state is authorized to use force to defend property rights\n(6:256). Kant\u2019s view, then, is that punishment of a particular\nindividual may serve deterrent functions even when the punishment may\nnot be based solely on deterrence as its justification.\n\nRetributivist theory holds not only that criminal guilt is required\nfor punishment, but that the appropriate type and amount of punishment\nis also determined by the crime itself. Traditionally this is the\nheart of the ancient injunction \u201can eye for an eye\u201d. Kant\nsupports this measurement for punishment because all other\nmeasurements bring into consideration elements besides strict justice\n(6:332), such as the psychological states of others that would measure\nthe effectiveness of various possible punishments on deterrence. As a\nprinciple, retribution grounds but does not specify the exact\npunishment. Kant recognizes that \u201clike for like\u201d is not\nalways possible to the letter, but believes that justice requires that\nit be used as the principle for specific judgments of punishment.\n\nThe retributivist theory of punishment leads to Kant\u2019s\ninsistence on capital punishment. He argues that the only punishment\npossibly equivalent to death, the amount of inflicted harm, is death.\nDeath is qualitatively different from any kind of life, so no\nsubstitute could be found that would equal death. Kant rejects the\nargument against capital punishment offered earlier in his century by\nthe Italian reformer, the Marchese Cesare Beccaria, who argued that in\na social contract no one would willingly give to the state power over\none\u2019s own life, for the preservation of that life is the\nfundamental reason one enters a social contract at all. Kant objects\nto Beccaria\u2019s claim by distinguishing between the source of a\nsocial contract in \u201cpure reason in me\u201d as opposed to the\nsource of the crime, myself as capable of criminal acts. The latter\nperson wills the crime but not the punishments, but the former person\nwills in the abstract that anyone who is convicted of a capital crime\nwill be punished by death. Hence one and the same individual both\ncommits the crime and endorses the punishment of death. This solution\nmirrors the claim that individuals can be coerced to join a civil\ncondition: reason dictates that entering the civil condition is\nmandatory even if one\u2019s particular arbitrary choice might be to\nremain outside it (see section 3).\n",
