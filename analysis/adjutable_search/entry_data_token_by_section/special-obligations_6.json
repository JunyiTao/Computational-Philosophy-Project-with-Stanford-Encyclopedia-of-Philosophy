    "main_text": "The Range and Types of Special Obligations || Filial Duty\n6.1 Filial Duty\n\nMedical advances are making it possible for people to live longer and\nlonger lives. Thus, our society has an ever increasing percentage of\nelderly persons in need of medical and other forms of care. Many of us\nbear very special ties to some of those persons: they are our parents,\nthe people who raised and nurtured us in our formative childhoods and\nyoung adulthoods. Now that our positions are reversed \u2014 we,\ntheir children, are self-sufficient and capable, and they, our\nparents, are in need of care and supervision \u2014 what do we owe to\nthem? Given the needs of elderly persons, caring for them may be\nextremely burdensome, and may require adult children to completely\nalter their lives, thereby making great sacrifices. Do adult children\nhave special obligations to their aging parents, and, if so, why?\n\nSimon Keller offers a thoughtful discussion of these issues in his\n\u201cFour Theories of Filial Duty.\u201d Keller rejects three\naccounts of such duties: the debt account, the gratitude account, and\nthe friendship account. He offers instead what he calls the\n\u201cspecial goods\u201d account: parents and children provide each\nother with very special goods, goods that cannot be gotten from any\nother type of relationship. No matter how true this is, Keller needs\nto explain why the fact that I can provide certain goods for my aging\nparents that nobody else can provide makes it the case that I have\nspecial obligations to my parents \u2014 after all, the\nconsequentialist seems to be able to accommodate my reasons to care\nfor my parents if my reason is grounded on the provision of benefits.\nSo one possible objection to Keller\u2019s account is that it is in\nserious danger of collapsing into consequentialism, i.e., of making\nour obligations to our parents only derivatively agent-relative.\n\nKeller also needs to give more serious consideration to the friendship\naccount of special obligations to parents. He claims that duties to\nparents are different from duties to friends because the former are\nmuch weightier than the latter and that our duties to our parents are\nnot within our discretion to the same extent as our duties to friends\n(263\u2013264). Keller\u2019s critique only works to the extent that\nhe is right about the nature of our duties to our friends. It might be\nargued that genuine friendship is not so easily disposed of as Keller\nmakes it, and many of us expect more of our friends than he seems to\nthink that friends should legitimately expect of one another. The\nimportant thing to see here, though, is how important an account of\nvarious relationships is to an understanding of the obligations that\nthose relationships generate. (See Jeske, 2008a.)\n",
