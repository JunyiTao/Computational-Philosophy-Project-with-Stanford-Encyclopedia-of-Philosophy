Although many make use of Anglo-American and\nanalytic philosophical approaches, what distinguishes the work in CPR\nfrom the general work in philosophy of race is its use of figures and\ntraditions of philosophy in what is sometimes called the\n\u201ccontinental\u201d sphere. For example, as will be discussed\nbelow, David Theo Goldberg (1993) and Cornel West (1982) have both made\nproductive and creative use of Michel Foucault\u2019s analysis of\npower and power/knowledge; Lewis Gordon (1995a; 1995b, 2000) and George\nYancy (2008) developed new phenomenological approaches to the study of\nracism by drawing from and building upon the work of Jean-Paul Sartre\nand Frantz Fanon; and others have found resources in Jacques Derrida,\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir, Friedrich Nietzsche, Herbert\nMarcuse, Jurgen Habermas, Martin Heidegger, and Sigmund Freud. To be\nsure, each of these European continental philosophers exhibited some of\nthe same patterns of racial ignorance rife in the general canon of\nWestern philosophy and have come under critical debate themselves\nwithin CPR. Yet the continental tradition paid productive attention to\nembodiment, socially variable rather than universal modes of\nperception, the link between power and concept formation, and thus\ncontributed new ways to think about the covert background structures\nthat affect democracy.\n\nContinental philosophy has also begun to critique its own\nartificially narrow canon and to include more prominently the writings\nof Frantz Fanon, Edouard Glissant, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edward Said, Kwame\nNkrumah, Gayatri Spivak, and others who were more centrally concerned\nwith, and acutely perceptive about, issues of race.\n\nIn a recent innovative move to approach the history of philosophy\ndifferently, some CPR scholars are \u201ccreolizing\u201d canonical\nfigures to foreground their reception in the colonized world (Gordon\nand Roberts 2015; Monahan 2017). Rousseau for example had a major\ninfluence on Caribbean thought, and reading Rousseau through Fanon,\nC.L.R. James, and others has produced new interpretive insights as well\nas new critical dialogues. These \u201cillicit blendings\u201d can\nbring questions of slavery, colonialism and race into the forefront of\ndiscussions that continue to engage the European modern tradition but\nin new ways (Bernab\u00e9 et al. 1990). By expanding the sphere of\ninterlocutors in debates over freedom or human dignity, we can also\ncome to engage a wider plurality of philosophical concepts and, in\neffect, creolize the canon. \n\nTo suggest that CPR has a singular methodology would be a mistake:\ndiscourse analysis, psychoanalysis, and phenomenology have conducted a\nfamous war against one another, and do not share a methodology. And yet\nwhat one finds on this side of the ledger of philosophical discussions\nof race are a notable body of differences in the topics of analysis;\nfor example, unlike in analytic philosophy of race, there is little\nattention to the question of whether the category of race is\nscientifically viable, whether we should eliminate the racial terms,\nand perhaps regrettably, there is little attention to the debates over\nconcrete policies to redress racism, such as affirmative action or\nreparations.\n\nIn general, Critical Philosophers of Race focus on how race operates\nin societies, the effects of race at both the structural and\nphenomenological levels, and the ways in which some forms of resistance\nto racial systems can be recuperated into sustaining the status quo.\nRace as a category is subject not so much to biological debate as\ngenealogical analysis, which makes it possible to see how, as Falguni\nSheth argues, the central issue is not the fact of the division of\nhuman beings into diverse groups, but the identification of racialized\npeoples as unruly or a priori threats to the body politic\n(Sheth 2009, 35). Just as Muslims are assumed to be terrorists until\nproven otherwise, so all non-white groups must prove their right to\ninclusion, their right to have rights. This suggests a different\nproblematic than a decontextualized approach to the reference of racial\nconcepts.\n",
