    "main_text": "Was Hume an Atheist?\n10. Was Hume an Atheist?\n\nOne of the most hotly debated issues arising out of Hume\u2019s\nphilosophy is whether or not he was an atheist. Two methodological and\nhistorical caveats should be briefly noted before addressing this\nquestion. First, as already noted, many of Hume\u2019s own\ncontemporaries regarded him in these terms. Our own contemporaries\nhave tended to dismiss these claims as coming from religious bigots\nwho did not understand Hume\u2019s philosophy. While there may be\nsome basis for these concerns, this is not true of all of Hume\u2019s\nearly critics (e.g. Thomas Reid) and, even if it were, it would not\nshow that his critics were wrong about this matter. Second, and\nrelated to the first point, Hume lived and wrote at a time of severe\nreligious persecution, by both the church and the state. Unorthodox\nreligious views, and more especially any form of open atheism, would\ncertainly provoke strong reactions from the authorities. Caution and\nsubterfuge in these circumstances was essential if difficulties of\nthese kinds were to be avoided. (For this reason it is especially\nironic to find religious apologists who confidently read Hume\u2019s\nprofessions of orthodoxy as entirely sincere but who never mention the\nawkward conditions in which he had to express his views.) While\nconditions of suppression do not themselves prove a writer or thinker\nsuch as Hume had a concealed doctrine, this possibility should be\nseriously and carefully considered.\n\nThe view that has, perhaps, been most dominant during the past century\nhas been that Hume was a skeptic and, as such, stands in a position\nthat endorses neither theism nor atheism. On this reading Hume\u2019s\nskeptical principles commit him to the view that human understanding\nis weak and imperfect and, so considered, we should avoid all\ndogmatism and also refrain from pursuing our investigations beyond the\nnarrow sphere of \u201ccommon life\u201d. More specifically, the\nskeptic, it is argued, must resist the temptation to address questions\nrelating to the \u201ctwo eternities\u201d, as this concerns\n\u201cthe origin of worlds, and the situation of nature, from, and to\neternity\u201d (D, 1.10/134; EU, 12.25). Read this way, Hume is what\nwe may describe as a \u201csoft skeptic\u201d with respect to the\nissue of theism. Throughout his writings, while he is certainly\nconcerned to discredit various (dogmatic) proofs for the existence of\nGod, he also avoids advancing or endorsing any (dogmatic) atheistic\narguments and their conclusions \u2013 preferring to suspend all\nbelief on such matters (NHR, 15.13; D, 1.3\u201311/131\u201336,\n12.33\u20134/227\u20138).\n\nAgainst this (soft) skeptical reading critics have argued both that it\nexaggerates and that it underestimates Hume\u2019s skeptical\ncommitments. One way of assessing Hume\u2019s position on this issue\nis to begin with Hume\u2019s suggestion that \u201cgenuine\ntheism\u201d involves the minimal claim that there exists some\n(invisible) \u201csupreme intelligence\u201d that is the origin,\ncreator and governor of this world (NHR, 4.2). So described, genuine\ntheism involves what we may call a \u201cthin\u201d conception of\nGod. There is, on this account, no commitment to some further, more\nspecific, set of attributes. In contrast with thin theism,\n\u201crobust\u201d theism presupposes a richer set of attributes,\nsuch as infinity, omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection.\nWhether one is judged an atheist or not may depend, not only on\nwhether the standard of theism is robust or thin, it may also depend\non what particular set of \u201cthick\u201d attributes are\nconsidered essential for belief in God.\n\nClearly major religions like traditional Christianity require a robust\nconception of God. With regard to robust theism, Hume is sharply\ncritical and goes well beyond the bounds of a more limited soft\nskepticism. That is to say, Hume pursues what we may call the\nhard skeptical aim of providing grounds for denying\nthe theist hypothesis in its various robust forms. For example, in a\nnumber of passages of the Dialogues Hume suggests that the\nabundant evidence of unnecessary evil provides us with compelling\ngrounds for denying that there exists an omnipotent, morally perfect\nbeing who is the creator and governor of this world. In light of these\nconsiderations, we may conclude that with respect to robust\ntheism Hume is a hard skeptic who defends a non-dogmatic form\nof atheism.\n\nWhile Hume may be a hard skeptic about robust theism, it does not\nfollow that he is either a hard or a soft skeptic about thin theism.\nAgainst views of this kind, it has been argued by a number of scholars\nthat Hume is committed to some form of thin theism or\n\u201cattenuated deism\u201d. (See, e.g., Gaskin 1988.) The key\npassages that are generally relied on in support of this view are\nfound in the last section of the Dialogues (XII). It is in\nthis context that Philo is understood to \u201creverse\u201d his\nopposition to the design argument and concede to Cleanthes \u201cthat\nthe works of nature bear a great analogy\u201d to human\nproductions and that a \u201cpurpose, intention, or design strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker\u201d (D,\n12.2/214, 12.6/216\u20137 \u2013 my emphasis; cp. NHR, Intro.1,\n15.1). There are, however, several important points to note in\nresponse to this aspect of Hume\u2019s discussion.\n\nFirst, Hume makes clear that this mode of (thin) theism leaves us\nstill in a state of \u201cprofound ignorance\u201d and that it\nprovides us with \u201cno inference that affects human life\u201d\n(D, 12.33/227; cp. EU, 11.23). Second, although Philo does make some\nconcessions to Cleanthes, he immediately goes on to perform a\n\u201cdouble reversal\u201d \u2013 retracting his original\nconcessions and returning to his original claim that there is a\n\u201cvast\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible\u201d difference that\nmust be supposed between the human and divine mind (D,\n12.6\u20137/217\u20139). All of which terminates in the (vague)\nconclusion \u201cthat the cause or causes of order in the universe\nprobably bear some remote analogy to human\nintelligence\u201d (D, 12.33/227 \u2013 my emphasis; see also EU,\n11.27, where Hume observes that the analogy involved here may be\ncompared to that between \u201cthe sun and a waxen taper\u201d\n[candle]). To strengthen the skeptical side of these reflections Hume\nhas Philo point out that there are other analogies available to us\n(e.g. the rotting of a turnip or the generation of an animal: D,\n12.7/217\u20139) which may suggest very different inferences and\nconclusions. Finally, to all this we may add that Hume\u2019s theory\nof belief, as presented in his earlier works, plainly implies that in\nthese circumstances there can be no belief in any such being.\nMore specifically, it is a feature of Hume\u2019s analysis of the\nmechanics of belief that when the analogy we are relying on is remote\nand imperfect, and the ideas involved are obscure and vague, belief\nwill be weakened if not completely erased (see, e.g., T,\n1.3.9.13\u20134; 1.3.13.25).\n\nIn light of these observations, we may conclude that it is highly\nproblematic to present Hume as any kind of theist, either\nrobust or thin. The question remains, however, whether his final\nskeptical attitude to thin theism is better understood as hard or soft\nin character? Hume\u2019s concluding remarks in the\nDialogues may suggest that the soft reading \u2013 stopping\nshort of any (atheistic) denial \u2013 is his final view (D,\n12.33/227\u20138). According to this interpretation, we should accept\nour epistemological predicament and avoid any final judgment on such\nmatters.\n\n\nThe whole is a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt,\nuncertainty, suspense of judgment appear the only result of our most\naccurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. (NHR, 15.13)\n\n\nWhile it is tempting to leave this matter here, settling on the view\nthat Hume is a hard skeptic about robust theism and a soft\nskeptic about thin theism, there are, nevertheless, grounds\nfor pushing the matter further for the case for Hume\u2019s hard\nskepticism regarding thin theism. That is to say, if we examine\nHume\u2019s remarks more carefully, we will find some clear arguments\nof a hard skeptical variety as they concern the thin theist\nhypothesis.\n\nThere are two hard skeptical arguments concerning this hypothesis that\nare especially important. The first is that Hume points out that our\nexperience suggests that mind is always accompanied by body (D,\n5.11/68-, 6.6/171-2, 8.11/186-7). Any reasonable hypothesis,\ntherefore, should be consistent with this aspect of human experience.\nAlthough our experience may be narrow and limited, given the nature of\nthe object of our investigations, it nevertheless provides some\n(substantial) basis for rejecting or denying the hypothesis of theism,\nincluding the thin version. Second, Hume also argues that there are\nalternative hypotheses that are available to us that are more\nplausible and consistent with human experience. In particular, we may\neasily revise the old Epicurean hypothesis of eternal matter that\ngenerates cycles of chaos and order (D, 6.12/174, 8.2/182). This is a\nhypothesis that provides us with natural explanations for forms and\norders of life and existence in a manner that clearly anticipates\nimportant features of Darwinian theory. Arguments of these kinds\nsuggest that, even with respect to the minimalism of thin theism, Hume\ngoes well beyond a soft skepticism that simply \u201csuspends\nbelief\u201d on these issues. His arguments are harder than this and\npresent grounds for denying theism, both robust and thin. On\nthis basis we may conclude that Hume\u2019s skeptical commitments are\nhard and not soft with respect to the theist hypothesis in all its\nforms and, as such, constitute a non-dogmatic form of\natheism.\n",
