Wondrous Nature, the Preternatural, and Miracles\n\nIn 1520, Pomponazzi finished On Incantations, a work that\nexpanded many themes of his psychological writings. The book\nundermines the use of demonic and supernatural explanations for\nsublunary phenomena. The work is presented as a response to the\nquestion: How would Aristotelians explain what \u201cseems to be\nbeyond the order of nature\u201d (praeter naturae\nordinem) or, in other words, what seems preternatural? The\ncategory of preternatual, which included diseases and\nstrange, seemingly irregular phenomena, formed the subject matter\nof numerous early modern philosophical inquiries (see Daston 2000).\nWith respect to On Incantations, Pomponazzi\u2019s friend,\nLudovico Panizza, asked him to explain the extraordinary recoveries of\nthree boys from a skin disease, burns, and a sword that physicians\ncould not remove (Praefatio.1). The actions of demons\ncould explain these recoveries; Pomponazzi stated that these\ndemonic acts are justified in accordance with ecclesiastical law\n(ex decreto Ecclesiae) and are capable of \u201csaving many\nexperiences\u201d. Yet, Pomponazzi contended that Aristotelians\nshould not use demons to explain these wondrous events. In\nPomponazzi\u2019s view even if demons exist, a premise that Aristotle\ndid not admit according to Pomponazzi\u2019s interpretation of\nMetaphysics Lambda, they would not be able to affect the\nsublunary world because they would not have adequate knowledge of its\nparticulars. Demons\u2019 knowledge of sublunary particulars must\nderive either through essences or from sensation and\nphantasmata (i.e., mental images). Knowledge through\nessences, however, does not provide knowledge of singulars but only\nuniversals and species. Moreover, knowledge from sensation and\nphantasmata entails generation, corruption, and corporeality,\nproperties which cannot belong to demons (1.1).\n\nDemons\u2019 lack of knowledge of natural particulars is merely one\nreason they cannot be the cause of wondrous sublunary events. Citing\nAugustine, Pomponazzi contended that all theologians hold that while\ndemons can directly move bodies from one place to another they cannot\nalter them directly but must do so through natural bodies. Yet,\nPomponazzi rejected the likelihood that demons affect change by\napplying active powers to passives, just like humans imperfectly do\nwhen they apply medicines. For Pomponazzi, this understanding of\ndemonic action is untenable because it requires that demons use\nsensible material substances, which would be detectable. Presumably\ndemons must carry these substances in pillboxes and bags, all of which\nis contrary to experience (1.2). Finally, he concluded that it is\nsuperfluous to suppose demonic influence \u201cbecause we can save\nthese kinds of experiences through natural causes\u201d (1.3).\nAccordingly, the first half of On Incantations posits\nhypothetical natural causes of preternatural experiences in an attempt\nto show the inadequacy and superfluity of demonic explanation.\nPomponazzi presented his conclusions as part of a process that leads\ncloser to the truth, arguing that \u201csciences develop through steps\u201d\n(scientiae enim fiunt per additamenta) (9.1). He likened\nthis process to changes in legal codes, whereby better laws replace\nolder inferior ones, admitting that his solutions should be\naccepted only while there are no\npreferable alternatives (Peroratio.1).\n\nEmploying doctrines key to natural magic, Pomponazzi put forth three\npotential ways that natural causes could explain wondrous effects:\ndirectly through manifest causes, such as heat and cold; through\noccult qualities or powers; or indirectly through vapors and spirits\nthat had been altered by such powers (3.1\u20133; Copenhaver 2015:\n272\u201384). In support of these explanations, citing Albertus\nMagnus, Marsilio Ficino, Pliny, and unnamed botanists, he maintained\nthat herbs, stones, minerals, and animal extracts possess nearly\ncountless occult powers and that if we knew them it would be possible\nto reduce those effects that the unlearned attribute to demons and\nangels to the actions of these occult powers. In support of the\nexistence of these occult powers Pomponazzi described experiences with\nherbal medicines, magnets, electric rays (torpedines), and\nremoras\u2014fish that allegedly could halt ships with the power of\ntheir mouths\u2014experiences, all verified as true by respected\nauthorities (3.2\u20133).\n\nPomponazzi contended that similar powers reside in humans, either\nthrough the temperament, the sensitive soul, or the intellectual soul.\nHe based this contention on the fact that human temperaments were\nwidely recognized to affect and determine human habits, inclinations,\nand physiognomy (3.4). Following Aristotle\u2019s De motu\nanimalium and Ficino\u2019s Platonic Theology, he\nargued that the actions of the soul are not only spiritual but also\nreal and cause alterations in the body, as is manifest in the physical\neffects of emotions, such as tremors and blushing (3.6). Finally, he\nmaintained that it is possible that the human mind can produce what it\nthinks through real bodily means, such as spirit and blood, in an\nanalogous way to the intelligences\u2019 production\nof changes in the sublunary world through corporal\nintermediaries, namely celestial bodies (3.6).\n\nApplying these causes, Pomponazzi explained that many of those accused\nof necromancy, like the medieval physicians and astrologers Pietro\nd\u2019Abano and Cecco d\u2019Ascoli, were merely very knowledgeable\nand capable of applying actives to passives (4.1). Moreover, it is\npossible that some humans possess extraordinary occult powers\nthat allow them to affect cures through touch, like the kings of\nFrance, or to perform other marvelous feats such as charming snakes\nand opening doors without touching them (4.2). Pomponazzi argued that\nthe powers of imagination can produce real effects. For example, he\ncited the widespread belief that women\u2019s thoughts at the time of\nconception will produce a fetus that is similar to those thoughts.\nTherefore, the power of fascination and imaginative powers transmitted\nthrough vapors might explain unexpected cures and diseases just as\nthey are supposedly responsible for the spread of leprosy and plague\n(4.3). While Pomponazzi admitted that some supposedly magical works\nare acts of deception\u2014such as fraudulent magicians\nconjuring through sieves\u2014he allowed that it might be possible\nthat some men possess natural occult powers that allow them\nto move a sieve or transmit vapors through prayers so that they form\nimages on mirrors (4.4). Pomponazzi used this analysis to respond to\nthe possible objection that these three kinds of natural causes\neliminate the acceptance of miracles. He maintained that many the\ndeeds reported in the Bible can be \u201csuperficially reduced\nto natural causes\u201d, but that some cannot, such as the\nresurrection of Lazarus, the eclipse during the crucifixion of Jesus,\nand the satisfaction of the hunger of a thousand people with five\nloaves of bread and two fish (6.7). Furthermore, while he conceded\nthat there is a remote possibility that the cross found in Saint\nCatherine\u2019s heart and Saint Francis\u2019s stigmata arose from\nnatural causes, he nonetheless stated it is more likely and more pious\nto understand them as miracles (6.8).\n\nPerhaps the most controversial portions of On Incantations\nsurround his explanation of why both pagan and monotheistic societies\ngive credence to the works of demons. His answer derives from his\nlargely Aristotelian and Averroistic conception of the ordering of the\nuniverse (see Perrone Compagni 2011: xxxiii\u2013lxxi). For\nPomponazzi, God is both the final and efficient cause of the universe,\na view he put forth in his earlier quaestiones on\nAverroes\u2019 De substantia orbis (Pomponazzi Corsi\ninediti: 1:299\u2013304). God, possessing knowledge of the\nessences of all species of beings, arranges the universe through the\ncelestial intelligences (10.2). In turn, the celestial intelligences\nthrough the powers of the stars cause the eternal cycles of change in\nthe universe. Accordingly, the entire arrangement of the world,\nincluding human society and religion, reflects and derives from\nGod\u2019s power. Thus, pronouncements in favor of the existence\nof demonic works from serious and important authorities, both\nreligious lawmakers and philosophers including Plato, are the result\nnot of their truth but of their usefulness for creating a virtuous\npopulace. Since a large portion of humanity is incapable of\nunderstanding philosophical truths, lawmakers have created and\nemployed myths or fables to inculcate virtue. The\nlegislator, like the physician who deceives a patient for the\npatient\u2019s own good, composes such fables because they\ncontribute to the larger purpose. These fables should not be\njudged as philosophical doctrines\u2014they contain neither falsity\nor truthfulness per se but have an allegorical or poetic\nmeaning. For Pomponazzi, these myths are not cynically\nused merely to gain political power but are harmonious with the\nuniverse\u2019s nature and order, as arranged by God and the\ncelestial intelligences. Political authority and obedience are\nnecessary for ensuring the persistence of political structures that\nare ordained for humanity, for which nature has given leaders and\norganization just as it has for flock animals, like bees and quail\n(10.2). Consequently, the growth and decline of religions are in\naccordance with the cyclical workings of nature.\n\nPomponazzi\u2019s judgment that the bulk of humanity is incapable of\nunderstanding philosophical truths corresponds to his statements in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul about the differences between\ndivine and human souls and the scarcity of humans who develop\ninto philosophers with comprehensive and accurate knowledge of nature\nand the universe. The inability of nearly all of humanity to\nunderstand true causes has led to further misunderstandings of\nprodigies, omens, divination, and oracles. Pomponazzi held that,\ninstead of being direct messages from God, they are reflections of a\npurposeful and well-ordered universe.\n\nPomponazzi contended that fields such as astrology and physiognomy\nread signs that are causally connected through celestial\ninfluences or physiological links. Celestial prodigies, omens, and\napparitions in the sky both signal and cause future events by\naffecting vapors and spirits that in turn influence the outcomes of\nhuman activity. Some apparitions, such as the recent image of Saint\nCelestine that appeared in the sky above Aquila while its residents\nprayed for protection from excessive rain, result from the collective\nimagination affecting vapors, exhalations, and clouds (see Giglioni\n2010). Moreover, Pomponazzi argued that the\nprodigies\u2019 indicative character explains their purpose and\nfinal cause that is linked to nature, which is interdependent, well\nordered, and under God\u2019s providence. The possibility of using\nprodigies to predict the future is analogous to physicians\u2019\nability to give prognoses for diseases using symptoms that seemingly\nare not directly connected to the maladies. Similarly ignorant people\nhave mistakenly understood the prognostications of sibyls and other\nseers as being caused by demons when in fact they possess either\nextraordinary occult natural powers or are caused by astral\npowers.\n\nInvoking celestial powers, occult virtues, the force of the\nimagination, and the intermediary actions of vapors and spirits,\nPomponazzi contended that by using only Aristotelian natural\nprinciples it was possible to save or explain seemingly miraculous,\nprodigious, and preternatural phenomena. Pomponazzi accepted the\nveracity of many of these phenomena, trusting for the most part\nin the accounts of contemporaries and ancient histories (12.7). At\ntimes, however, he rejected accounts from history as implausible, such\nas tales of Vespasian curing with his saliva and his foot (8.1).\nNevertheless, in his view, the numerous historical\nnarratives of presages, oracles, and divination confirmed\ntheir reality (10.2). \n\nIn the closing of On Incantations, Pomponazzi stated that\nwhile he believed that what the Peripatetics would have probably\n(verisimiliter) believed is in agreement with Christianity,\nhe would nevertheless revoke the entire work and submit himself to the\nCatholic Church in the event that this writing were judged to\noppose Catholic doctrine (Peroratio.1). A number of\ninterpreters have found this conclusion to be disingenuous,\nand the Holy Office placed the work on the Index of Prohibited\nBooks by the 1570s. A censor wrote that while Pomponazzi put\nforth arguments that seem to undermine the existence of miracles he\ndid make strong ones in their favor (Baldini & Spruit 2009: vol.\n1, tome 3, 2279).\n",
