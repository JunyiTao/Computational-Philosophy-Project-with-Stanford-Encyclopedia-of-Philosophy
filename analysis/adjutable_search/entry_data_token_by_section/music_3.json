    "main_text": "Musical Ontology || The Fundamentalist Debate\n2.1 The Fundamentalist Debate\n\nMusical works in the Western classical tradition admit of multiple\ninstances (performances). Much of the debate over the nature of such\nworks thus reads like a recapitulation of the debate over the\n\u201cproblem of universals\u201d; the range of proposed candidates\ncovers the spectrum of fundamental ontological theories. We might\ndivide musical ontologists into the realists, who posit the existence\nof musical works, and the anti-realists, who deny their existence.\nRealism has been more popular than anti-realism, but there have been\nmany conflicting realist views. We begin with two unorthodox realist\nviews before moving on to more orthodox Platonist and nominalist\ntheories, concluding with a consideration of anti-realism.\n\nIdealists hold that musical works are mental entities. Collingwood\n(1938) and Sartre (1940) respectively take musical (and other) works\nto be imaginary objects and experiences. The most serious objections\nto this kind of view are that (i) it fails to make works\nintersubjectively accessible, since the number of works going under\nthe name The Rite of Spring will be as multifarious as the\nimaginative experiences people have at performances with that name,\nand (ii) it makes the medium of the work irrelevant to an\nunderstanding of it. One might have the same imaginative experience in\nresponse to both a live performance and a recording of The Rite of\nSpring, yet it seems an open question whether the two media are\naesthetically equivalent. But see Cox 1986 and Cray & Matheson\n2017 for attempts to revive idealism.\n\nDavid Davies argues that musical works, like all works of art, are\nactions, in particular the compositional actions of their\ncomposers (2004). Thus he revives what we might call an \u201caction\ntheory\u201d of the ontology of art. (An earlier defender of such a\nview is Gregory Currie (1989), who argues that artworks are\ntypes of action, rather than the particular actions\nwith which Davies identifies them.) Although deciding between theories\nof musical ontology is always to some extent a matter of finding a\nbalance between the benefits of a theory and its cost in terms of our\npre-theoretic intuitions, action theories have a particularly hard row\nto hoe since they imply that an instance of a work is some action\nperformed by a composer, rather than a performance. In order to make\nup for such damage to our intuitions the theoretical benefits of an\naction theory would have to be quite extensive.\n\nMost theorists think that some kind of Platonist or nominalist theory\nof musical works is more plausible than those so far considered.\nPlatonism, the view that musical works are abstract objects, is\narguably still the dominant view, though it seems to be losing ground\nto sophisticated nominalisms. Its great advantage is its ability to\nrespect more of our pre-theoretic intuitions about musical works than\nother theories can. On the other hand, it is the most ontologically\npuzzling, since abstract objects are not well understood. Nonetheless,\nPlatonism has been tenacious, with much of the debate centering around\nwhat variety of abstract object musical works are. What we might call\n\u201csimple Platonism\u201d (known simply as\n\u201cPlatonism\u201d in the literature), is the view that works are\neternal existents, existing in neither space nor time (Kivy 1983a,\n1983b, Dodd 2007). Puy (2019) presents a variation according to which\nmusical works are higher-order types, of which the types other\nPlatonist thinks are works are specific versions of works.\n(See D. Davies 2021 for discussion.)\n\nAccording to \u201ccomplex Platonism,\u201d musical works come to\nexist in time as the result of human action. The complexity is\nmotivated by a number of features of musical practice, including the\nintuition that musical works are creatable, the attribution of various\naesthetic and artistic properties to works, and the fine-grained\nindividuation of works and performances (e.g., in terms of who\ncomposed them, or what instruments they are properly performed upon)\n(Ingarden 1961; Thomasson 2004; Wolterstorff 1980; Wollheim 1968:\n1\u201310, 74\u201384; Levinson 1980, 1990b, 2012; S. Davies 2001:\n37\u201343; Howell 2002; Stecker 2003a: 84\u201392).\n\nNominalists identify a musical work with something concrete. The most\nobvious candidate is a collection of performances, whether the\ncollection be understood as a set (Goodman 1968; Predelli 1995, 1999a,\n1999b, 2001), a fusion (Caplan & Matheson 2004, 2006), or\nsomething more esoteric (Tillman 2011; see also Moruzzi 2018). Charles\nNussbaum (2007: 143\u201387) and P. D. Magnus (2012) argue for a\nclose analogy between musical works and species. Nussbaum (2021: 334)\npoints out that a sophisticated nominalist theory of species has been\ndeveloped in great detail over the years by Ruth Millikan (1984,\n2000). While such views are attractive because they appeal only to the\nleast problematic kinds of entities, they face serious challenges.\nThough many of our claims about musical works may be paraphraseable\ninto claims about sets of (possible) performances, some seem to make\nintractable reference to works. For instance, most performances of The\nRite of Spring\u2014even including the possible ones\u2014include\nseveral wrong notes. Thus it is difficult to imagine how the\nparaphrase schema will avoid the nonsensical conclusion that The Rite\nof Spring contains several wrong notes, if the work consists entirely\nof performances. In response to this problem, most nominalists add to\nthe collection of performances some provenential item, such as an\noriginal score or act of composition. Whether this addition can solve\nthe problem without necessitating the reintroduction of an abstract\nentity is one question any nominalist must address.\n\nIntermediate between Platonism and nominalism are the views of Philip\nLetts (2018) and Guy Rohrbaugh (2003). Letts argues that any view of\nmusical works as types would be improved by identifying those\ntypes with their associated properties, a proposal that may be\ndeveloped in a Platonist or nominalist direction. Rohrbaugh\u2019s\nview of musical works as historical individuals\n\u201cembodied in,\u201d but not constituted by, physical things\nsuch as scores and performances closely resembles to the views of\nNussbaum and Magnus, discussed above, but Rohrbaugh takes the work to\nbe an abstract object over and above its embodiments. (For discussion,\nsee Dodd 2007: 143\u201366.)\n\nIn contrast to all these realist views stand those of the\nanti-realists, who deny that there are any such things as musical\nworks. An early proponent of such a view is Richard Rudner (1950),\nthough it is difficult to say whether he is best interpreted as an\neliminativist or a fictionalist, the two anti-realist views currently\non the table. According to eliminativists, there are no such things as\nmusical works, and thus we ought to stop trying to refer to them. Ross\nCameron (2008) defends such a view, but only with respect to\n\u201cOntologese\u201d\u2014the language we speak when we do\nontology. He argues that ordinary English locutions such as\n\u201cthere are many musical works\u201d can be true without there\nbeing any musical works. (For critical discussion, see Predelli 2009\nand Stecker 2009.) According to fictionalists, the value of discourse\nabout musical works is not truth, and thus we ought not to abandon the\ndiscourse despite the non-existence of its subject matter, but rather\nto adopt a different, make-believe attitude towards it (or perhaps we\nalready do so). (See Kania 2008; for criticism, see D. Davies 2011:\n45\u201350, Letts 2015, and Nussbaum 2021: 337.)\n\nMuch of this debate over the fundamental ontological category to which\nmusical works belong has turned on \u201ctechnical\u201d issues,\nthat is, controversial general metaphysical claims about the nature of\nproperties, causation, embodiment, and so on (e.g., Howell 2002;\nTrivedi 2002; Caplan & Matheson 2004, 2006; Dodd 2007; Hazlett\n2012; Kleinschmidt & Ross 2012; Dodd & Letts 2017; Cameron\n2008). In the face of this, some theorists have pointed out that\nmusical works are cultural entities, and thus the methodology\nappropriate to uncovering their ontological status might be quite\ndifferent from that of general metaphysics (Goehr 1992; S. Davies\n2003a; D. Davies 2004; Thomasson 2006). For further discussion of the\nmethodology of musical ontology, see D. Davies 2009, 2017; Predelli\n2009; Stecker 2009; Dodd 2010, 2013; Mag Uidhir 2012b; and Nussbaum\n2021.\n",
