That is, whenever there is a\nNagel-reduction, then there is a Suppes-reduction. Moreover, according\nto Schaffner, Suppes\u2019 model covers cases that should not be\ncovered, namely, arbitrary reductions (Schaffner 1967). Similar\nproblems arise for successors of Suppes\u2019 model that try to cash\nout reduction in terms of an isomorphism or an analogy-relation, which\nhave been developed and refined by Sneed (1971) and Stegm\u00fcller\n(1979). The basic problem of these accounts has been described by\nMoulines (1984: 55) and a similar idea can be found in Hoering (1984).\nMoulines puts it as follows:\n\n\nThere is at least one further aspect of reduction that is overlooked\nby [the structuralist conception]. This is what I would like to call\n\u201cthe ontological aspect\u201d. I wish to argue that, for a\ncomplete picture of a reductive relationship between two theories, one\nhas to take into account some sort of relation between the respective\ndomains. Otherwise, when confronted with a particular example of a\nreductive pair, we would feel that all we have is an ad hoc\nmathematical relationship between two sets of structures, perhaps by\nchance having the mathematical properties we require of reduction but\nnot really telling something about \u201cthe world\u201d. We could\nhave a reductive relationship between two theories that are completely\nalien to each other. (Moulines 1984: 55)\n\n\nThus, the problem is that mere structural similarity does not\nguarantee that both theories are actually concerned with the same\nphenomena, or the same properties. This is a problem Nagelian models\ndo not face if they describe bridge-laws in semantic terms, i.e., in\nterms of extensional or intensional relations among the relevant\npredicates or kind terms. Relatively independent of structuralist\nmodels, philosophers who work at the interface of the philosophy of\nmind and the philosophy of science have developed accounts that later\nhave been labeled \u2018New Wave\u2019 reductionism.\n",
