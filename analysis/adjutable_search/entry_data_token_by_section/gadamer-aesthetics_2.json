    "main_text": "The Contemporaneous and Art Experience\n3. The Contemporaneous and Art Experience\n\nOf all things that speak to us, it is the artwork that does so most\ndirectly (PH 95). The phenomenological immediacy of art which\ninitiates Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic inquiry into aesthetic\nexperience may not seem a promising starting point from a hermeneutic\nperspective. It declares an unconventional hermeneutical approach to\nart: \u201cif we define the task of hermeneutics as the bridging of\npersonal or historical distance between minds, then the experience of\nart would seem to fall entirely outside its [hermeneutics\u2019]\nprovenance\u201d (PH 95/97). However, Gadamer does not define\nhermeneutics this way. It is not the reconstruction of artistic\nintention which forms the object of his inquiry but the question of\nwhat informs the immediacy of an artwork\u2019s claim. The artwork is\nan object of hermeneutical investigation not because of any provenance\nin psychological events but because of the fact that it says\nsomething to us (PH 98). Hermeneutic involvement is required because\nthe meaning transmitted can never be fully complete and unambiguous.\nIt demands interpretive involvement. Hermeneutics is required wherever\nthere is a restricted transposition of thought. The historical\nfinitude of meaning and the fact that no meaning can be given\ncompletely necessitates hermeneutical involvement in our experience of\nan artwork. The task of interpretation is to probe the possible\nmeanings held within the experience of a work, and by drawing on them,\nto bring that experience to greater completeness.\n\nIt should be noted that Gadamer\u2019s talk of integrating the alien\ninto what is understood as meaningful is not to be grasped as\nsubsumption within the same. Assimilation is not the equivalent of\ntranslating the alien into a stable set of meanings which do not\nchange as a consequence of that subsumption. Integration implies a\nreciprocity: the integrated changes its character as well as\nthe character of the whole within which integration occurs.\nFurthermore, whatever is given in subjective consciousness as\ncontemporaneous has dimensions of meaning that transcend what that\nconsciousness initially grasps. Gadamer is concerned to probe the\nontic dimensions of aesthetic experience. The thesis that experience\nof the contemporaneousness of art involves us in more than what we are\npresently aware of (i.e., the \u201csubstance\u201d of underlying\nand on-going trans-individual linguistic and cultural practices) is\nsupported by the three arguments from analogy concerning the character\nof play, the festival, and the symbol.\n",
