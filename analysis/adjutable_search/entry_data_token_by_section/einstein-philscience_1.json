Theoretical Holism: The Nature and Role of Conventions in Science\n\nAny philosophy of science must include an account of the relation\nbetween theory and evidence. Einstein learned about the historicity of\nscientific concepts from Mach. But his preferred way of modeling the\nlogical relationship between theory and evidence was inspired mainly\nby his reading of Pierre Duhem\u2019s La Th\u00e9orie physique: son\nobjet et sa structure (Duhem 1906). Einstein probably first read\nDuhem, or at least learned the essentials of Duhem\u2019s philosophy of\nscience around the fall of 1909, when, upon returning to Zurich from\nthe patent office in Bern to take up his first academic appointment at\nthe University of Zurich, he became the upstairs neighbor of his old\nfriend and fellow Zurich physics student, Friedrich Adler. Just a few\nmonths before, Adler had published the German translation of La\nTh\u00e9orie physique (Duhem 1908), and the philosophy of\nscience became a frequent topic of conversation between the new\nneighbors, Adler and Einstein (see Howard 1990a).\n\nTheoretical holism and the underdetermination of theory choice by\nempirical evidence are the central theses in Duhem\u2019s philosophy of\nscience. His argument, in brief, is that at least in sciences like\nphysics, where experiment is dense with sophisticated instrumentation\nwhose employment itself requires theoretical interpretation,\nhypotheses are not tested in isolation but only as part of whole\nbodies of theory. It follows that when there is a conflict between\ntheory and evidence, the fit can be restored in a multiplicity of\ndifferent ways. No statement is immune to revision because of a\npresumed status as a definition or thanks to some other a priori\nwarrant, and most any statement can be retained on pain of suitable\nadjustments elsewhere in the total body of theory. Hence, theory\nchoice is underdetermined by evidence.\n\nThat Einstein\u2019s exposure to Duhem\u2019s philosophy of science soon left\nits mark is evident from lecture notes that Einstein prepared for a\ncourse on electricity and magnetism at the University of Zurich in the\nwinter semester of 1910/11. Einstein asks how one can assign a\ndefinite electrical charge everywhere within a material body, if the\ninterior of the body is not accessible to test particles. A\n\u201cMachian\u201d positivist would deem such direct empirical\naccess necessary for meaningful talk of a charge distribution in the\ninterior of a sold. Einstein argues otherwise:\n\nWe have seen how experience led to the introd. of the concept of the\nquantity of electricity. it was defined by means of the forces that\nsmall electrified bodies exert on each other. But now we extend the\napplication of the concept to cases in which this definition cannot be\napplied directly as soon as we conceive the el. forces as forces\nexerted on electricity rather than on material particles. We\nset up a conceptual system the individual parts of which do not\ncorrespond directly to empirical facts. Only a certain totality of\ntheoretical material corresponds again to a certain totality of\nexperimental facts.\n\n\nWe find that such an el. continuum is always applicable only for the\nrepresentation of el. states of affairs in the interior of ponderable\nbodies. Here too we define the vector of el. field strength as the\nvector of the mech. force exerted on the unit of pos. electr. quantity\ninside a body. But the force so defined is no longer directly\naccessible to exp. It is one part of a theoretical construction that\ncan be correct or false, i.e., consistent or not consistent with\nexperience, only as a whole. (Collected Papers of Albert\nEinstein, hereafter CPAE, Vol. 3, Doc. 11 [pp.\n12\u201313])\n\n\nOne can hardly ask for a better summary of Duhem\u2019s point of view in\napplication to a specific physical theory. Explicit citations of Duhem\nby Einstein are rare (for details, see Howard 1990a). But explicit\ninvocations of a holist picture of the structure and empirical\ninterpretation of theories started to prevail at the turn of the\n1920s.\n\nDuring the decade 1905\u20131915, Einstein had more or less explicitly\nassumed that in a good theory there are certain individual\nparts that can be directly coordinated with the behavior of\nphysically-existent objects used as probes. A theory can be said to be\n\u2018true or false\u2019 if such objects respectively behave or do\nnot behave as predicted. In special relativity, as in classical\nmechanics, the fundamental geometrical/kinematical variables, the\nspace and time coordinates, are measured with rods and clocks\nseparately from the other non-geometrical variables, say, charge\nelectric field strengths, which were supposed to be defined by\nmeasuring the force on a charge test particle. In general relativity,\ncoordinates are no longer directly measurable independently from the\ngravitational field. Still, the line element \\(ds\\) (distance\nbetween nearby spacetime points) was supposed to have a\n\u2018natural\u2019 distance that can be measured with rods and\nclocks. In the late 1910s, pressed by the epistemological objections\nraised by different interlocutors\u2014in particular Hermann Weyl\n(Ryckman 2005) and the young Wolfgang Pauli (Stachel,\n2005)\u2014Einstein was forced to recognize that this epistemological\nmodel was at most a provisional compromise. In principle rod- and\nclock-like structures should emerge as solutions of a future\nrelativistic theory of matter, possibly a field theory encompassing\ngravitation and electromagnetism. In this context, the sharp\ndistinction between rods and clocks that serve to define the\ngeometrical/kinematical structure of the theory and other material\nsystems would become questionable. Einstein regarded such distinction\nas provisionally necessary, give the current state of physics.\nHowever, he recognized that in principle a physical theory should\nconstruct rods and clocks as solutions to its equations (see Ryckman\n2017, ch. VII for an overview on Einstein view on the relation between\ngeometry and experience). \n\nEinstein addressed this issue in several popular writings during the\n1920s, in particular, the famous lecture Geometrie und\nErfahrung (Einstein 1921, see also Einstein, 1923, Einstein,\n1924, Einstein 1926; Einstein 1926; see Giovanelli 2014 for an\noverview). Sub specie temporis, he argued, it was useful to\ncompare the geometrical/kinematical structures of the theory with\nexperience separately from the rest of physics. Sub specie\naeterni, however, only geometry and physics taken together can be\nsaid to be \u2018true or false.\u2019 This epistemological model\nbecame more appropriate, while Einstein was moving beyond general\nrelativity in the direction of theory unifying the gravitational and\nthe electromagnetic field. Einstein had to rely on progressively more\nabstract geometrical structures which could not be defined in terms of\nthe behavior of some physical probes. Thus, the use of such structures\nwas justified because of their role in the theory as a whole. In the\nsecond half of the 1920s, in correspondence with Reichenbach\n(Giovanelli 2017) and Meyerson (Giovanelli 2018), Einstein even denied\nthat the very distinction between geometrical and non-geometrical is\nmeaningful (Lehmkuhl 2014). \n\nA different, but especially interesting example of Einstein\u2019s reliance\non a form of theoretical holism is found in a review that Einstein\nwrote in 1924 of Alfred Elsbach\u2019s Kant und Einstein (1924),\none of the flood of books and articles then trying to reconcile the\nKant\u2019s philosophy. Having asserted that relativity theory is\nincompatible with Kant\u2019s doctrine of the a priori, Einstein explains\nwhy, more generally, he is not sympathetic with Kant:\n\nThis does not, at first, preclude one\u2019s holding at least to the\nKantian problematic, as, e.g., Cassirer has done. I am even\nof the opinion that this standpoint can be rigorously refuted by no\ndevelopment of natural science. For one will always be able to say\nthat critical philosophers have until now erred in the establishment\nof the a priori elements, and one will always be able to establish a\nsystem of a priori elements that does not contradict a given physical\nsystem. Let me briefly indicate why I do not find this standpoint\nnatural. A physical theory consists of the parts (elements) A, B, C,\nD, that together constitute a logical whole which correctly connects\nthe pertinent experiments (sense experiences). Then it tends to be the\ncase that the aggregate of fewer than all four elements, e.g., A, B,\nD, without C, no longer says anything about these\nexperiences, and just as well A, B, C without D. One is then free to\nregard the aggregate of three of these elements, e.g., A, B, C as a\npriori, and only D as empirically conditioned. But what remains\nunsatisfactory in this is always the arbitrariness in the\nchoice of those elements that one designates as a priori,\nentirely apart from the fact that the theory could one day be replaced\nby another that replaces certain of these elements (or all four) by\nothers. (Einstein 1924, 1688\u20131689)\n\n\nEinstein\u2019s point seems to be that while one can always choose to\ndesignate selected elements as a priori and, hence, non-empirical, no\nprinciple determines which elements can be so designated, and our\nability thus to designate them derives from the fact that it is only\nthe totality of the elements that possesses empirical content.\n\nMuch the same point could be made, and was made by Duhem himself (see\nDuhem 1906, part 2, ch. 6, sects. 8 and 9), against those who would\ninsulate certain statements against empirical refutation by claiming\nfor them the status of conventional definitions. Edouard Le Roy (1901)\nhad argued thus about the law of free fall. It could not be refuted by\nexperiment because it functioned as a definition of \u201cfree\nfall.\u201d And Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1901) said much the same about\nthe principles of mechanics more generally. As Einstein answered the\nneo-Kantians, so Duhem answered this species of conventionalist: Yes,\nexperiment cannot refute, say, the law of free fall by itself, but\nonly because it is part of a larger theoretical whole that has\nempirical content only as a whole, and various other elements of that\nwhole could as well be said to be, alone, immune to refutation.\n\nThat Einstein should deploy against the neo-Kantians in the early\n1920s the argument that Duhem used against the conventionalism of\nPoincar\u00e9 and Le Roy is interesting from the point of view of\nEinstein\u2019s relationships with those who were leading the development\nof logical empiricism and scientific philosophy in the 1920s,\nespecially Schlick and Reichenbach. Einstein shared with Schlick and\nReichenbach the goal of crafting a new form of empiricism that would\nbe adequate to the task of defending general relativity against\nneo-Kantian critiques (see Schlick 1917 and 1921, and Reichenbach\n1920, 1924, and 1928; for more detail, see Howard 1994a). But while\nthey all agreed that what Kant regarded as the a priori element in\nscientific cognition was better understood as a conventional moment in\nscience, they were growing to disagree dramatically over the nature\nand place of conventions in science. The classic logical empiricist\nview that the moment of convention was restricted to conventional\ncoordinating definitions that endow individual primitive terms, worked\nwell, but did not comport well with the holism about theories\n\nIt was this argument over the nature and place of conventions in\nscience that underlies Einstein\u2019s gradual philosophical estrangement\nfrom Schlick and Reichenbach in the 1920s. Serious in its own right,\nthe argument over conventions was entangled with two other issues as\nwell, namely, realism and Einstein\u2019s famous view of theories as the\n\u201cfree creations of the human spirit\u201d (see, for example,\nEinstein 1921). In both instances what troubled Einstein was that a\nverificationist semantics made the link between theory and experience\ntoo strong, leaving too small a role for theory, itself, and the\ncreative theorizing that produces it.\n\nIf theory choice is empirically determinate, especially if theoretical\nconcepts are explicitly constructed from empirical primitives, as in\nCarnap\u2019s program in the Aufbau (Carnap 1928), then it is hard\nto see how theory gives us a story about anything other than\nexperience. As noted, Einstein was not what we would today call a\nscientific realist, but he still believed that there was content in\ntheory beyond mere empirical content (on the relations between\nEinstein\u2019s realism and constructism see Ryckman 2017, ch. 8 and 9). He\nbelieved that theoretical science gave us a window on nature itself,\neven if, in principle, there will be no one uniquely correct story at\nthe level of deep ontology (see below, section 5). And if the only\nchoice in theory choice is one among conventional coordinating\ndefinitions, then that is no choice at all, a point stressed by\nReichenbach, especially, as an important positive implication of his\nposition. Reichenbach argued that if empirical content is the only\ncontent, then empirically equivalent theories have the same content,\nthe difference resulting from their different choices of coordinating\ndefinitions being like in kind to the difference between \u201ces\nregnet\u201d and \u201cil pleut,\u201d or the difference between\nexpressing the result of a measurement in English or metric units,\njust two different ways of saying the same thing. But then, Einstein\nwould ask, where is there any role for the creative intelligence of\nthe theoretical physicist if there is no room for genuine choice in\nscience, if experience somehow dictates theory construction?\n\nThe argument over the nature and role of conventions in science\ncontinued to the very end of Einstein\u2019s life, reaching its highest\nlevel of sophistication in the exchange between Reichenbach and\nEinstein the Library of Living Philosopher\u2019s volume, Albert\nEinstein: Philosopher-Physicist (Schilpp 1949). The question is,\nagain, whether the choice of a geometry is empirical, conventional, or\na priori. In his contribution, Reichenbach reasserted his old view\nthat once an appropriate coordinating definition is established,\nequating some \u201cpractically rigid rod\u201d with the geometer\u2019s\n\u201crigid body,\u201d then the geometry of physical space is\nwholly determined by empirical evidence:\n\nThe choice of a geometry is arbitrary only so long as no definition of\ncongruence is specified. Once this definition is set up, it becomes an\nempirical question which geometry holds for physical\nspace.\u2026 The conventionalist overlooks the fact that only the\nincomplete statement of a geometry, in which a reference to the\ndefinition of congruence is omitted, is arbitrary. (Reichenbach 1949,\n297)\n\n\nEinstein\u2019s clever reply includes a dialogue between two characters,\n\u201cReichenbach\u201d and \u201cPoincar\u00e9,\u201d in which\n\u201cReichenbach\u201d concedes to \u201cPoincar\u00e9\u201d\nthat there are no perfectly rigid bodies in nature and that physics\nmust be used to correct for such things as thermal deformations, from\nwhich it follows that what we actually test is geometry plus physics,\nnot geometry alone. Here an \u201canonymous non-positivist\u201d\ntakes \u201cPoincar\u00e9\u2019s\u201d place, out of respect, says\nEinstein, \u201cfor Poincar\u00e9\u2019s superiority as thinker and\nauthor\u201d (Einstein 1949, 677), but also, perhaps, because he\nrealized that the point of view that follows was more Duhem than\nPoincar\u00e9. The \u201cnon-positivist\u201d then argues that\none\u2019s granting that geometry and physics are tested together\ncontravenes the positivist identification of meaning with\nverifiability:\n\nNon-Positivist: If, under the stated circumstances, you hold\ndistance to be a legitimate concept, how then is it with your basic\nprinciple (meaning = verifiability)? Must you not come to the point\nwhere you deny the meaning of geometrical statements and concede\nmeaning only to the completely developed theory of relativity (which\nstill does not exist at all as a finished product)? Must you not grant\nthat no \u201cmeaning\u201d whatsoever, in your sense, belongs to\nthe individual concepts and statements of a physical theory, such\nmeaning belonging instead to the whole system insofar as it makes\n\u201cintelligible\u201d what is given in experience? Why do the\nindividual concepts that occur in a theory require any separate\njustification after all, if they are indispensable only within the\nframework of the logical structure of the theory, and if it is the\ntheory as a whole that stands the test? (Einstein 1949, 678).\n\n\nTwo years before the Quine\u2019s publication of \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (1951), Einstein here makes explicit the semantic\nimplications of a thoroughgoing holism.\n\nIf theory choice is empirically underdetermined, then an obvious\nquestion is why we are so little aware of the underdetermination in\nthe day-to-day conduct of science. In a 1918 address celebrating Max\nPlanck\u2019s sixtieth birthday, Einstein approached this question via a\ndistinction between practice and principle:\n\nThe supreme task of the physicist is \u2026 the search for those\nmost general, elementary laws from which the world picture is to be\nobtained through pure deduction. No logical path leads to these\nelementary laws; it is instead just the intuition that rests on an\nempathic understanding of experience. In this state of methodological\nuncertainty one can think that arbitrarily many, in themselves equally\njustified systems of theoretical principles were possible; and this\nopinion is, in principle, certainly correct. But the\ndevelopment of physics has shown that of all the conceivable\ntheoretical constructions a single one has, at any given time, proved\nitself unconditionally superior to all others. No one who has really\ngone deeply into the subject will deny that, in practice, the world of\nperceptions determines the theoretical system unambiguously, even\nthough no logical path leads from the perceptions to the basic\nprinciples of the theory. (Einstein 1918, 31; Howard\u2019s translation)\n\n\nBut why is theory choice, in practice, seemingly empirically\ndetermined? Einstein hinted at an answer the year before in a letter\nto Schlick, where he commended Schlick\u2019s argument that the deep\nelements of a theoretical ontology have as much claim to the status of\nthe real as do Mach\u2019s elements of sensation (Schlick 1917), but\nsuggested that we are nonetheless speaking of two different kinds of\nreality. How do they differ?\n\nIt appears to me that the word \u201creal\u201d is taken in\ndifferent senses, according to whether impressions or events, that is\nto say, states of affairs in the physical sense, are spoken of.\n\n\nIf two different peoples pursue physics independently of one another,\nthey will create systems that certainly agree as regards the\nimpressions (\u201celements\u201d in Mach\u2019s sense). The mental\nconstructions that the two devise for connecting these\n\u201celements\u201d can be vastly different. And the two\nconstructions need not agree as regards the \u201cevents\u201d; for\nthese surely belong to the conceptual constructions. Certainly on the\n\u201celements,\u201d but not the \u201cevents,\u201d are real in\nthe sense of being \u201cgiven unavoidably in experience.\u201d\n\nBut if we designate as \u201creal\u201d that which we arrange in the\nspace-time-schema, as you have done in the theory of knowledge, then\nwithout doubt the \u201cevents,\u201d above all, are real.\u2026\nI would like to recommend a clean conceptual distinction\nhere. (Einstein to Schlick, 21 May 1917, CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc.\n343)\n\n\nWhy, in practice, are physicists unaware of underdetermination? It is\nbecause ours is not the situation of \u201ctwo different peoples\npursu[ing] physics independently of one another.\u201d Though\nEinstein does not say it explicitly, the implication seems to be that\napparent determination in theory choice is mainly a consequence of our\nall being similarly socialized as we become members of a common\nscientific community. Part of what it means to be a member of a such a\ncommunity is that we have been taught to make our theoretical choices\nin accord with criteria or values that we hold in common. \n",
