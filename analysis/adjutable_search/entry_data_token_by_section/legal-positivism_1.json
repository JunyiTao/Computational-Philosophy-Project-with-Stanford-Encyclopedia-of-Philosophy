    "main_text": "The Existence and Sources of Law\n2. The Existence and Sources of Law\n\nEvery human society has some form of social order, some way of marking\nand encouraging approved behavior, deterring disapproved behavior, and\nresolving disputes about that behavior. What then is distinctive of\nsocieties with legal systems and, within those societies, of their\nlaw? Before exploring some positivist answers, it bears emphasizing\nthat these are not the only questions worth asking about law. While an\nunderstanding of the nature of law requires an account of what makes\nlaw distinctive, it also requires an understanding of what it has\nin common with other forms of social control. Some Marxists\nare positivists about the nature of law while insisting that its\ndistinguishing characteristics matter less than its role in\nreplicating and facilitating other forms of domination. (Though other\nMarxists disagree: see Pashukanis 1924). They think that the specific\nnature of law casts little light on their primary concerns. But one\ncan hardly know that in advance; it depends on what the nature of law\nis.\n\nFor Bentham and Austin, law is a phenomenon of societies with a\nsovereign: a determinate person or group who have supreme and\nabsolute de facto power\u2014they are obeyed by all or most\nothers but do not themselves similarly obey anyone else. The laws in\nthat society are a subset of the sovereign\u2019s commands:\ngeneral orders that apply to classes of actions and people and that\nare backed up by threat of force or \u201csanction\u201d. This\nimperatival theory is positivist, for it identifies the existence of\nlaw with patterns of command and obedience that can be ascertained\nwithout considering whether the sovereign has a moral right to rule or\nwhether their commands are meritorious. It has two other distinctive\nfeatures. The theory is monistic: it represents all laws as\nhaving a single form, imposing obligations on their subjects, though\nnot on the sovereign itself. The imperativalist acknowledges that\nultimate legislative power may be self-limiting, or limited externally\nby what public opinion will tolerate, and also that legal systems\ncontain provisions that are not imperatives (for example, permissions,\ndefinitions, and so on). But they regard these as part of the\nnon-legal material that is necessary for every legal system. (Austin\nis a bit more liberal on this point). The theory is also\nreductivist, for it maintains that the normative language\nused in describing and stating the law\u2014talk of authority,\nrights, obligations, and so on\u2014can all be analyzed without\nremainder in factual terms, typically as concatenations of statements\nabout power and obedience.\n\nImperatival theories are now without influence in legal philosophy\n(but see Ladenson 1980 and Morison 1982). What survives of their\noutlook is the idea that legal theory must ultimately be rooted in\nsome account of the political system, an insight that came to be\nshared by all major positivists save Kelsen. Their particular\nconception of a society under a sovereign commander, however, is\nfriendless (except among Foucauldians, who strangely take this relic\nas the ideal-type of what they call \u201cjuridical\u201d power). It\nis clear that in complex societies there may be no one who has all the\nattributes of sovereignty, for ultimate authority may be divided among\norgans and may itself be limited by law. Moreover, sovereignty is a\nnormative concept. A legislator is one who has authority to\nmake laws, and not merely someone with great social power, and it is\ndoubtful that \u201chabits of obedience\u201d is a candidate\nreduction for explaining authority. To distinguish genuine obedience\nfrom coincidental compliance we need something like the idea of\nsubjects being oriented to, or guided by, the commands. Explicating\nthis will carry us far from the power-based notions with which\nclassical positivism hoped to work. The imperativalists\u2019 account\nof the character of individual laws is also subject to decisive\nobjections (Hart 1961 [2012: 26\u201378]; and Hacker 1973). Treating\nall laws as commands conceals important differences in their social\nfunctions, in the ways they operate in practical reasoning, and in the\nsort of justifications to which they are liable. For instance, laws\nconferring the power to marry command nothing; they do not obligate\npeople to marry, or even to marry according to the prescribed\nformalities. Nor is reductivism any more plausible here: we speak of\nlegal obligations when there is no probability of sanctions being\napplied and when there is no provision for sanctions (as in the duty\nof courts to apply the law). Moreover, we take the existence of legal\nobligations to be a reason for imposing sanctions, not a\nconsequence or constituent of it.\n\nHans Kelsen retains the imperativalists\u2019 monism but abandons\ntheir reductivism. On his view, law is characterized by a singular\nform and basic norm. The form of every law is that of a\nconditional order, directed at the courts, to apply sanctions if a\ncertain behavior (the \u201cdelict\u201d) is performed. On this\nview, law is an indirect system of guidance: it does not tell subjects\nwhat to do; it tells officials what to do to its subjects\nunder certain conditions. Thus, what we ordinarily regard as the legal\nduty not to steal is for Kelsen merely a logical correlate of the\nprimary norm which stipulates a sanction for stealing (1945 [1961:\n61]). The objections to imperatival monism apply also to this more\nsophisticated version: the reduction misses important facts, such as\nthe point of having a prohibition on theft; the law is not indifferent\nbetween, on the one hand, people not stealing and, on the other,\nstealing and suffering the sanctions. But in one respect the\nconditional sanction theory is in worse shape than is imperativalism,\nfor it has no way to fix on the delict as the duty-defining condition\nof the sanction\u2014that is but one of a large number of relevant\nantecedent conditions, including the legal capacity of the offender,\nthe jurisdiction of the judge, the constitutionality of the offense,\nand so forth. Which among all these is the content of a legal\nduty?\n\nKelsen\u2019s most important contribution lies in his attack on\nreductivism and his doctrine of the \u201cbasic norm\u201d. He\nmaintains that law is a normative domain and must understood as such.\nMight does not make right\u2014not even legal right\u2014so the\nphilosophy of law must explain the fact that law imposes obligations\non its subjects. Moreover, law is a normative system:\n\u201cLaw is not, as it is sometimes said, a rule. It is a set of\nrules having the kind of unity we understand by a system\u201d (1945\n[1961: 3]). For the imperativalists, the unity of a legal system\nconsists in the fact that all its laws are commanded by one sovereign.\nFor Kelsen, it consists in the fact that they are all links in one\nchain of authority. For example, a by-law is legally valid because it\nis created by a corporation lawfully exercising the powers conferred\non it by the legislature, which confers those powers in a manner\nprovided by the constitution, which was itself created in a way\nprovided by an earlier constitution. But what about the very first\nconstitution, historically speaking? Its authority, says Kelsen, is\n\u201cpresupposed\u201d. The condition for interpreting any legal\nnorm as binding is that the first constitution is validated by the\nfollowing \u201cbasic norm:\u201d \u201cthe original\nconstitution is to be obeyed\u201d. Now, the basic norm cannot\nbe a legal norm\u2014we cannot explain the bindingness of law by\nreference to more law without an infinite regress. Nor can it be a\nsocial fact, for Kelsen maintains that the reason for the validity of\na norm must always be another norm\u2014no ought from is. It follows,\nthen, that a legal system must consist of norms all the way down. It\nbottoms in a hypothetical, transcendental norm that is the condition\nof the intelligibility of any (and all) other norms as binding. To\n\u201cpresuppose\u201d this basic norm is not to endorse it as good\nor just\u2014presupposition is a cognitive stance only\u2014but it\nis, Kelsen thinks, the necessary precondition for a non-reductivist\naccount of law as a normative system.\n\nThere are many difficulties with this, not least of which is the fact\nthat if we are going to accept the basic norm as the solution it is\nnot clear what we thought was the problem in the first place. One\ncannot say both that presupposing the basic norm is what validates all\ninferior norms and also that an inferior norm is part of the legal\nsystem only if it is connected by a chain of validity to the basic\nnorm. We need a way into the circle. Moreover, it draws the boundaries\nof legal systems incorrectly. The Canadian Constitution of 1982 was\nlawfully created by an Act of the U.K. Parliament, and on that basis\nCanadian law and English law should be parts of a single legal system,\nrooted in one basic norm: \u201cThe (first) U.K. constitution is to\nbe obeyed\u201d. Yet English law is not binding in Canada, and a\npurported repeal of the Constitution Act by the U.K. would be without\nlegal effect there.\n\nIf law cannot ultimately be grounded in force, or in a presupposed\nnorm, on what does its authority rest? The most influential solution\nis perhaps H.L.A. Hart\u2019s. His solution resembles Kelsen\u2019s\nin its emphasis on the normative foundations of legal systems, but\nHart rejects Kelsen\u2019s transcendentalist, Kantian view of\nauthority in favor of an empirical, Weberian one. For Hart, the\nauthority of law is social. The ultimate criterion of validity in a\nlegal system is neither a legal norm nor a presupposed norm, but a\nsocial rule that exists only because it is actually\npracticed, that is, used to guide conduct. Law ultimately\nrests on custom: customs about who shall have the authority to decide\ndisputes, what they shall treat as binding reasons for decision, i.e.,\nas sources of law, and how laws may be changed. Of these three\n\u201csecondary rules\u201d, as Hart calls them, the\nsource-determining rule of recognition is most important, for\nit specifies the ultimate criteria of validity in the legal system. It\nexists only because it is practiced by officials, and it is not only\nthat the recognition rule best explains their practice, it is the rule\nto which they actually appeal in arguments about what standards they\nare bound to apply. Hart\u2019s account is therefore in one sense\nconventionalist (see Marmor 1998 and Coleman 2001): ultimate legal\nrules are social norms, although they are neither the product of\nexpress agreement nor conventions in the Schelling-Lewis sense (see\nGreen 1999). Thus for Hart too the legal system is rule-based all the\nway down, but at its root is a social norm that has the kind of\nnormative force that customs have. It is a regularity of behavior\nregarding which officials take \u201cthe internal point of\nview:\u201d they use it as a standard for guiding and evaluating\ntheir own and others\u2019 behavior, and this use is displayed in\ntheir conduct and speech, including the resort to various forms of\nsocial pressure to support the rule and the ready application of\nnormative terms such as \u201cduty\u201d and\n\u201cobligation\u201d when invoking it.\n\nLaw, then, has its ultimate basis in the behaviors and attitudes of\nits officials. In the eyes of some this still seems to imply a\nmystifying reduction: how can we generate the oughts of the legal\nworld from the is of official consensus? Concerns of this type part\nmotivate Scott Shapiro\u2019s understanding of law and his attempt to\nbreak with Hart\u2019s theory: laws, he suggests, should be conceived\nof as \u201cgeneralized plans, or planlike norms, issued by those who\nare authorized to plan for others\u201d (2011: 155). Understanding\nlaw on the model of social planning, Shapiro suggests, frees us from\nmisplaced concerns about its metaphysical basis. Just as you or I can\nadopt a plan for our day just by willing it, so a legal system\u2019s\nofficials can create or recognize plans for its subjects. To the\nextent there remains an issue, however, it is not clear that the\nnotion of planning itself offers any deeper explanation. To begin\nwith, planning, whether by an individual or a group, involves setting\nrules with the aim of achieving certain ends. So the ontology of plans\nfolds into and becomes part of the more general ontology of rules on\nwhich Hart was rightly focused. Second, it is unclear whether the\nmechanics of law are accurately captured under the label of planning\n(is the law against theft, for example, to be thought of as a plan\nthat people not deprive others of their property?\u2014a somewhat\nimplausible reading of the relevant injunction\u2014or is the\nplanning element exhausted by the decision to create the prohibition,\nin which case the law is not the plan). Nonetheless, Shapiro\u2019s\naccount helpfully reminds us that the theoretical complexity of law as\na social kind does not render implausible an understanding of its\nfoundation based in the everyday actions of its agents. In this he\njoins Hart.\n\nIt is an important feature of Hart\u2019s account that the rule of\nrecognition is an official custom, and not a standard\nnecessarily shared by the broader community. If the\nimperativalists\u2019 picture of the political system was pyramidal\npower, Hart\u2019s is more like Weber\u2019s rational bureaucracy.\nLaw is normally a technical enterprise, characterized by a division of\nlabor. Ordinary subjects\u2019 contribution to the existence of law\nmay therefore amount to no more than passive compliance, and in an\nextreme case perhaps less than this. Thus, Hart\u2019s necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a legal system are that\n\n\n\nthose rules of behavior which are valid according to the\nsystem\u2019s ultimate criteria of validity must be generally obeyed,\nand\u2026its rules of recognition specifying the criteria of legal\nvalidity and its rules of change and adjudication must be effectively\naccepted as common public standards of official behavior by its\nofficials. (1961 [2012: 116]) \n\n\nAnd this division of labor is not a normatively neutral fact about\nlaw; it is politically charged, for it sets up the possibility of law\nbecoming remote from the life of a society, a hazard to which Hart is\nacutely alert (1961 [2012: 117]; cf. Waldron 1999 and Green 2008).\n\nAlthough Hart introduces the rule of recognition through a speculative\nanthropology of how it might emerge in response to deficiencies in a\ncustomary social order, he is not committed to the view that law is a\ncultural achievement. To the contrary, the idea that legal order is\nalways a good thing, and that societies without it are deficient, is a\nfamiliar element of many anti-positivist views, beginning\nwith Henry Maine\u2019s criticism of Austin on the ground that his\ntheory would not apply to certain Indian villages. The objection\nembraces the error it seeks to avoid. It imperialistically assumes\nthat it is always a bad thing to lack law, and then makes a dazzling\ninference from ought to is: if it is good to have law, then each\nsociety must have it, and the concept of law must be adjusted to show\nthat it does. If one thinks that law is a many splendored thing, one\nwill be tempted by a very wide understanding of law, for it would seem\nimproper to charge others with missing out. Positivism releases the\nharness. Law is a distinctive form of political order, not a moral\nachievement, and whether it is necessary or even useful depends\nentirely on its content and context. Societies without law may be\nperfectly adapted to their environments, missing nothing.\n\nA positivist account of the existence and content of law, along any of\nthe above lines, offers a theory of the validity of law in\none of the two main senses of that term (see Harris 1979:\n107\u2013111). Kelsen says that validity is the specific mode of\nexistence of a norm. In this sense a valid law is one that is\nsystemically valid in the jurisdiction\u2014it is part of\nthe legal system, and identified as such by virtue of its dependence\non the system\u2019s social sources. The idea is distinct from that\nof validity as moral propriety, i.e., a sound justification for\nrespecting the norm. For the legal positivist, this depends on the\nnorm\u2019s merits. One indication that these senses differ is that\none may know that a society has a legal system, and know what its laws\nare, without having any idea whether they are morally justified. For\nexample, one may know that the law of ancient Athens included the\npunishment of ostracism without knowing whether it was justified,\nbecause one does not know enough about its effects, about the social\ncontext, and so forth.\n\nNo legal positivist argues that the systemic validity of law\nestablishes its moral validity, i.e., that it should be\nobeyed by subjects or applied by judges. Even Hobbes, to whom this\nview is sometimes ascribed, required that law actually be able to keep\nthe peace, failing which we owe it nothing. Bentham and Austin, as\nutilitarians, hold that such questions always turn on the\nconsequences, and both acknowledge that disobedience is therefore\nsometimes fully justified. Kelsen insists that \u201cThe science of\nlaw does not prescribe that one ought to obey the commands of the\ncreator of the constitution\u201d (1960 [1967: 204]). Hart believes\nthat law may generate a prima facie duty to obey, grounded in\nbut also limited by fairness\u2014so there is no obligation to unfair\nor pointless laws (Hart 1955: 185\u2013186). Raz goes further still,\narguing that there isn\u2019t even a prima facie duty to\nobey the law, not even in a just state (Raz 1979 [2009:\n233\u2013249]). The peculiar accusation that positivists believe the\nlaw is always to be obeyed is without foundation. Indeed, Hart\u2019s\nown view is that an overweening deference to law consorts more easily\nwith theories that imbue it with moral ideals, permitting \n\n\nan enormous overvaluation of the importance of the bare fact that a\nrule may be said to be a valid rule of law, as if this, once declared,\nwas conclusive of the final moral question: \u201cOught this law to\nbe obeyed?\u201d (Hart 1958: 75)\n\n",
