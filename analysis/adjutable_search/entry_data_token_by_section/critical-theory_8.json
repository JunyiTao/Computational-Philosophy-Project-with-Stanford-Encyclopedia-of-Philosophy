    "main_text": "Critical Methods || Immanent Critique\n2.1 Immanent Critique\n\nIn responding to the three-pronged methodological challenge of\nrelating theory to social reality, reflecting on the standpoint of\ncritique, and spelling out its normativity, Frankfurt School critical\ntheory moves beyond the usual juxtaposition between internal and\nexternal critique. Frankfurt School theorists rely on a third model of\ncritique, which builds on Hegel and Marx and is often understood as\nimmanent or reconstructive. Critique proceeds immanently or\nreconstructively when it seeks to secure its normative resources and\nepistemic standpoint from the (often implicit) normative structures\nand epistemic possibilities of the practices and\nself\u2010understandings that are constitutive of the (type of)\nsociety in question. Immanent critique avoids the dichotomy between an\ninternal critique that refers to standards and standpoints that are\nalready recognized by those criticized and an external critique that\nrefers to standards and standpoints that are not (or not yet)\nrecognized and therefore have to be derived independently from the\nagents\u2019 perspective and their social context (see Jaeggi 2005,\n2014, Celikates 2009, Stahl 2013a). Critical theory understood in this\nway is both grounded in social reality as it exists and emancipatory\nin seeking to radically transform this reality.\n\nThe critique of ideology can both serve as a paradigmatic example of\nimmanent critique in this sense and illustrate some of the challenges\nthis model faces (Ng 2015). Ideology critique is immanent insofar as\nit starts from the contradictions of a social and ideological\nconstellation and the experience of those affected, which is shaped by\nthese contradictions. It does not criticize an ideological form of\nconsciousness because it is immoral or unethical, but because of its\nepistemic, functional, and genetic features, i.e. for being false or\ndistorted, for contributing to the reproduction of relations of\ndomination, and for arising from within such relations in ways that\nare relatively immune to self-reflection. Consequently, the critique\nof ideology does not focus primarily on the injustice or domination\nfound in society, but on the forms of consciousness, culture,\npractice, habit, and affect that make this injustice or domination\nseem natural or unavoidable (Jaeggi 2008). On this view, any critical\ntheory that aims at emancipation must first aim at diagnosing and\novercoming those obstacles that keep agents from fully experiencing,\ncritically reflecting on, and collectively acting against the unjust\nand dominating conditions under which they live. The question is how\ncritical theorists can do so without falling back into\nepistemologically and politically problematic distinctions between\nfalse and true consciousness, between ideology and scientific insight,\nand between true (\u201cobjective\u201d) and false (\u201cpurely\nsubjective\u201d) interests and needs (Celikates 2006; see\n Section 3.3\n below).\n\nThese challenges are among the many challenges critical theorists face\nin developing an immanent critique that is linked to social reality\nand practice, a link that comes out in two ways. First, theory is\nanchored in social reality in terms of its genesis, as it is shaped by\nthe social context from which it emerges. Second, theory aims at a\npractice that transforms social reality. This dual commitment to\nlinking theory and practice is spelled out in two rather different\nways, both in the history of the Frankfurt School and in contemporary\ndiscussions. One way of anchoring theory in social reality \u2013\ncall it the crisis approach \u2013 starts with social contradictions,\nantagonisms, and crises, along with the practical challenges and\nconflicts that result, and maintains that identifying those conflicts\nrequires socio-theoretical analysis and sociological research (Jaeggi\n2017a, Fraser and Jaeggi 2018). A second way of anchoring theory in\nsocial reality \u2013 call it the struggles approach \u2013 takes\nsocial struggles and movements and the practices of critique and\nresistance of oppressed groups as its starting point. This approach\nincorporates alternative standpoints and counter-hegemonic\nepistemologies into its theorizing with the aim of countering the\npotentially disempowering and anti-emancipatory effects that arise\nwhen critical theorists view crises mainly in terms of structural\ncontradictions while ignoring or underestimating the ways that social\nand political movements themselves can produce and intensify crises\n(Collins 2019, Celikates 2022).\n\nWhile this distinction between crisis and struggle is useful for\nheuristic purposes, it should not be overstated. Most critical\ntheorists share a commitment to the emancipatory role of theory as\nwell as an immanent anchoring of theory in social reality, whether qua\ncrises or struggles. The distinction is a matter of degree and\nstarting points, and it is usually agreed that crises and struggles\nstand in need of mutual articulation (see Benhabib 1986,\n123\u2013133, and\n Section 4.1\n and\n Section 4.2\n below).\n\nHorkheimer maintained that a critical theory should not have an\nexternal relation to, but must enter into a \u201cdynamic\nunity\u201d with, practice, so that it is \u201cnot merely an\nexpression of the concrete historical situation but also a force\nwithin it to stimulate change\u201d (1937a [1972: 215], see also\nMarcuse 1937, Horkheimer 1937b). But under social conditions that\nneutralize social struggles or turn them into regressive backlash\nmovements, the \u201cdynamic unity\u201d envisaged by Horkheimer can\nappear foreclosed. Even for Adorno, whose diagnosis of the\n\u201ctotally administered world\u201d is the most radical example\nof this foreclosure, however, it would be a mistake to conceptualize\nexisting society as a perfectly closed, monolithic, and functionally\nintegrated self-reproducing totality. Rather, even when society is\nviewed as a totality, it has to be understood not in terms of\nhomogeneity or frozen stability but in terms of structural antagonisms\n(Adorno 1957 [1976, 77]), conflict, and process (Adorno 1966b), i.e.\nas riddled with contradictions that, at least in principle, allow for\nforms of oppositional experience, consciousness, or practice that a\ncritical theory can build on. In one of his last texts written shortly\nbefore his death, Adorno concludes that \u201ccritical theory is not\naiming at totality, but criticizes it. This also means, however, that\nit is, in its substance, anti-totalitarian, with the utmost political\ndetermination\u201d (Adorno 1969a; our translation). Even \u2013 or\nespecially \u2013 in the face of the closure of political space, the\npolitical significance of a critical theory can consist in\nsafeguarding the link between theory and the possibility of a\nradically different practice. At the same time, this defense of the\nrelation to practice needs to be complemented by a defense of theory\nin the face of what Adorno identified as an \u201cactionist\u201d\nand anti-theoretical ideology of \u201cpseudo-activity\u201d in\narguing that \u201cpraxis without theory, lagging behind the most\nadvanced state of cognition, cannot but fail, and praxis, in keeping\nwith its own concept, would like to succeed\u201d (Adorno 1969b\n[1998, 265]).\n",
