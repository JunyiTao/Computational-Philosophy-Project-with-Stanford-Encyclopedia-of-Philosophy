    "main_text": "Other Forms of Internalism\n4. Other Forms of Internalism\n\nIt might be thought that one's view as to exactly what sorts of things\ncount as justifiers will also determine whether one is committed to\njustification internalism or justification externalism. This question\nis bound up with another way of drawing the distinction between\ninternalism and externalism, namely, with the view that restricts\njustifiers to items that are literally internal to the cognizer. One\nversion of this position is perspectival internalism, to use\na phrase coined by William Alston, which in one of his formulations\ncomes to this:\n\nPI: The only thing that can justify S's belief that\np is some other justified beliefs of S. (Alston,\n1989. Epistemic Justification, p. 191.)\n\n\nThese other justified beliefs, of course, would be the justifiers, and\nsince they are beliefs that the person S has, they count as\ninternal to S in the sense that they are internal to\nS's overall mental framework.\n\nClosely related to perspectival internalism is a somewhat broader\nthesis according to which all justifiers are mental states of\ncognizers. This thesis has been termed \u201cmentalism\u201d by Earl\nConee and Richard Feldman. Making use of some ideas suggested by\nMatthias Steup, John Pollock, and Ernest Sosa, they say that this\nversion of internalism,\n\n\u2026is the view that a person's beliefs are justified only by\nthings that are\u2026internal to the person's mental life. We shall\ncall this version of internalism \u201cmentalism.\u201d (Conee and\nFeldman 2001. p. 233)\n\n\nMentalism is broader than PI because it does not restrict the\njustifiers to justified beliefs, nor even to beliefs. So, mentalism\nbut not PI is perfectly compatible with a view that says that sensory\nstates that are themselves not beliefs and not things that can be\nappropriately said to be justified can nonetheless function as\njustifiers. A very simple example that illustrates the difference\nwould be one in which a person acquires a justified belief that there\nis a tomato in front of her on the basis of a perceptual experience of\nsomething looking red and spherical. Mentalism can allow that this\nvery experience of something looking red and spherical is a justifier\nfor the belief that there is a tomato present. For PI, by contrast, if\nthis experience is to contribute to the justified tomato belief, it\nwould have to be because one has a justified belief about something\nappearing red and spherical. In short, mentalism allows that the very\nexperience may count as a justifier, while PI requires that a\njustified belief, presumably about that experience, is the appropriate\njustifier.\n\nA somewhat weaker form of mentalism would maintain only that for each\njustified belief a person has, some essential justifiers for that\nbelief are mental states of that person, but that other essential\njustifiers for that belief need not be mental states. Such an account\nwould not be a wholly internalist account, of course, in either the\nmentalist sense or the accessibility sense, for these further\nessential justifiers need be neither mental states nor particularly\naccessible to reflective awareness. The account would rather be one\nthat contained both some internalist elements (some essential\njustifiers are mental states) and some externalist elements (some\nessential justifiers are not mental states). The result would count,\ntherefore, as a mixed theory, though the theory might be\notherwise perfectly viable as a general account of justified\nbelief.\n\nSince externalism with respect to justification contrasts with\ninternalism, we should expect there to be an externalist contrast to\nmentalism. The denial of mentalism would simply be the view that holds\nthat something other than mental states of a cognizer can qualify as\ngenuine justifiers. Once again we can illustrate such a position by\nconsidering a reliable process theory of justification. On that theory\nreliability is defined across mental states, so one might think that\nthe theory is either mentalist or that at least it strongly overlaps\nthe mentalist doctrine. That is, the theory directs our attention to\nbelief-formation processes and belief-sustaining processes, and both\nof them take some mental states as inputs and yield other mental\nstates as outputs. The simplest version of the former might be a\nperceptual case in which the inputs are sensory states and the outputs\nare beliefs. Or, if one thinks of the process of reaching a new belief\nthrough reasoning, the inputs are some prior beliefs and the outputs\nare new beliefs. The difference between this theory and mentalism\ncomes in the fact that for reliabilism the inputs and outputs, though\ncertainly mental, are not themselves justifiers. These inputs\nare, of course, highly relevant to the justification of the belief.\nHowever, this relevance does not suffice to make the inputs\njustifiers, any more than possession of relevant concepts needed to\nunderstand a belief would count as a justifier for that belief.\nRather, it is the reliability of the processes in which these inputs\nand outputs figure that count as appropriate justifiers. So, in\naddition to being an externalist theory with regard to accessibility,\nthe reliable process theory is externalist with regard to whether the\njustifiers for a belief are or have to be mental states. The\nexternalist with regard to this issue insists that they need not\nbe.\n",
