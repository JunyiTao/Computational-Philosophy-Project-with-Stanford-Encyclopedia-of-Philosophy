    "main_text": "Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism || Paris Museum Debates: Cuvier vs. the Transformists\n4.2 Paris Museum Debates: Cuvier vs. the Transformists\n\nWithin the confines of the Paris Mus\u00e9um national\nd\u2019histoire naturelle, parallel, if not immediately\ncontinuous, developments of related issues bearing on species\ntransformism were made by Lamarck\u2019s younger colleague and holder\nof the chair of Mammals and Birds, the comparative anatomist Etienne\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire (1772\u20131844). Less concerned with the issue\nof species transformism than with the implications of comparative\nanatomy and comparative embryology for the relations of forms,\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire explored the anatomical \u201cunity of\ntype\u201d\u2014the remarkable resemblance of anatomical structure\nbetween organisms revealed by comparative anatomy. Pursuing this issue\nin his own Mus\u00e9um lectures and in several papers,\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire proceeded to work out the implications of the\ninner anatomical similarities of vertebrates. Based upon two main\nprinciples, the \u201cprinciple of connection\u201d and the\n\u201claw of balance\u201d, Geoffroy St. Hilaire drew attention to\nthe implications of comparative anatomy for the unity of the animal\nkingdom.\n\nBy 1823, Geoffroy St. Hilaire had extended his theory of the\n\u201cunity of type\u201d to the claim that even the invertebrates\nshared a common plan with the vertebrates, and by 1825 he had embraced\na limited version of transformism with assertions that the unity of\ntype also revealed the relationships between ancient and contemporary\nforms (Corsi 2011; Le Guyader 1998 [2004]: chp. 4]). This led him into\ndirect opposition to the claims of his one- time friend and colleague,\nGeorges Cuvier, holder of the Mus\u00e9um Chair of\nComparative Anatomy. who had argued in his Lectures on Comparative\nAnatomy (1800\u20131805) that animal form involved a law-like\ncoordination between form and function for teleological purposes,\nknown as the \u201claw of the correlation of parts.\u201d In his\nR\u00e8gne animale of 1817, this principle was extended to\nthe claim that comparative anatomy revealed a formal distinction of\nfour distinct and autonomous body plans\n(embranchments)\u2014Radiarians, Mollusca, Articulata, and\nVertebrata\u2014that may display some unity of type within these\nembranchments, but which precluded any theory of continuity\nbetween these major plans. \n\nThis anatomical argument was to constitute the mainstay of\nCuvier\u2019s opposition to transformism, and it served as a powerful\nsource of opposition to transformism into the Darwinian era and even\nbeyond. On the basis of these arguments, Cuvier also concluded that\ncomparative anatomy revealed genuine extinctions of species\nin the past. First proposed in his paper on the species of elephants\nin 1795, and then extended more broadly to vertebrate paleontology\ngenerally in such works as his Investigations on the Fossil Bones\nof Quadrupeds (1812), Investigations on Fossil Bones\n(1821\u20131823), and in his Discourse on the Revolutions of the\nSurface of the Earth (1822), Cuvier claimed that constraints of\norganization and the systemic relations of anatomical structures meant\nthat species could not simply transform into others as claimed by\nLamarck and Geoffroy. As he developed its implications, it was\nexpanded into a theory of specific faunal and floral ages separated by\ndramatic events\u2014R\u00e9volutions, later termed by\nothers \u201ccatastrophes\u201d\u2014that led to massive\nextinctions that required replacements of species by some cause that\nwas not specified. The issue of the \u201corigin\u201d of species in\nthe early nineteenth century was a direct consequence of these\nCuvierian extinctions.\n\nThe opposition between Cuvierian organicism and the Lamarck-Geoffroy\nadvocacies of transformism, centered on the claimed implications of\nthe \u201cunity of type.\u201d This underlay the \u201cgreat\ndebate\u201d that broke out in French life science in the late 1820s\nbetween Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier and their respective disciples\n(Corsi 2012; Appel 1987). This debate also forms one of the historic\nencounters between differing conceptions of biology that affected many\naspects of nineteenth-century life science. It drew division lines\nwithin French, and even British, biology over the relation of\norganisms to history, and it directly engaged the possibility of\nspecies change. It also raised the issue of species origins. This\ndebate also served to focus issues within French life science in a way\nthat significantly affected the later negative French reception of\nDarwin\u2019s work. This debate eventually was to involve issues of\npaleontology, comparative anatomy, transformism of species, and the\nrelation of form to function. It also extended to issues of political\nalliance and ideological commitments of numerous individuals in\nRestoration France (Corsi 2011, 2012).\n\nCuvier\u2019s arguments, reinforced by the authority he carried in\nFrench comparative anatomy and science generally, coupled with his\npolitical influence during the Napoleonic and Restoraation periods,\nresulted in the dominance of his positions within the Paris\nAcad\u00e9mie des sciences. Nonetheless, the tradition of\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire remained a strong current within the\nMus\u00e9um. It was continued by such individuals as\nAntoine Etienne Serres (1786\u20131868), whose arguments for a\nhistorical sequence of forms, backed by embryological evidence, were\ncanonized in morphological circles as the Meckel-Serres law of\nrecapitulation (Corsi 2012; Gould 1977: chp. 3). Outside official\nAcademic French science, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire\u2019s theories had\nbroad appeal to those who saw the relevance of developmental\nembryology for issues of group relationship, an issue that Cuvier, as\na moderate preformationist, had ignored. Present interest in the\nrelationship between evolution and developmental\nbiology\u2014commonly termed \u201cevo- devo\u201d\u2014 has\nstimulated new attention to Geoffroy St. Hilaire\u2019s views (Le\nGuyader 1998 [2004]).\n",
