    "main_text": "Recognition || Sign-Cognition\n5.4 Sign-Cognition\n\nWhat Price calls \u201csign-cognition\u201d, \u201ccognition of the\nabsent\u201d (1953a: 95), is \u201cthe type of cognition in which\nsomething not immediately experienced is brought before the mind by\nmeans of a sign\u201d (1953a: 88). Price thinks that it is crucial to\nexplain what \u201cbeing before the mind\u201d amounts to here. For\ninstance, a subject recognises that someone is at the door by hearing\na knock\u2014that someone is absent from the subject\u2019s\nexperience but brought before the mind by means of a sign, the knock.\n\n\nSign-cognition need not involve a linguistic response, nor the\nentertainment of an image of what is signified. But, the recognition\noften involves a generation of preparedness to act. If I recognise an\nunstable cyclist I recognise a possible accident and get ready to\navoid it. So sometimes the recognition leads to actions that block\nwhat is recognised as likely. Price adds that there is something\nabstract about what is recognised. For example, if I recognise that\nrain is imminent the specific character of the actual rain is not\nsignified. On the other hand what is recognised can be fairly\nspecific\u2014the action-readiness that is stimulated might also be\nspecific and delicate. These differences are matters of degree. He\nadds too that there are differences in degree in how strong the sign\nis or is taken to be. If one hears thunder then that is a strong sign\nof earlier lightning, but hearing a police siren is a fairly weak sign\nof a local crime. It may just be a traffic accident call-out. Further,\nthe temporal direction of what is signified can be the past, as with\nthe lightning, the present, or the future. Price often discusses\nsign-recognition in animals (especially cats, leading Iris Murdoch\n[1940] to call him a \u201cfelinist\u201d, see also Mac Cumhaill\n& Wiseman 2022: 78), calling it \u201cthe typical achievement of\nthe animal mind\u201d (1953a: 98) and reveals a genuine awareness of\nthe behaviour of animals (e.g., animal vigilance, 1953a:\n108)\u2014this interest echoes Hume (1739\u20131740: III, xvi; 1748:\nsect. 9).\n\nBut what does it mean to talk of the signified feature as thought of?\nThe adult case of recognition is based on the capacity to tell of\npresented cases whether (or not) they fall under a possessed concept.\nPrice points out that this capacity can be possessed without being\nactualised and can be actualised to different degrees. He proposes\nthat we should say of sign-recognition that the concept of the\nsignified is partially actualised in the subject.\n\nRoughly, this half-actualisation can be specified operationally,\nalthough Price expresses it differently. If I see smoke and take it as\na sign of fire in the environment that means that my dispositions\nto behave are modified in a way that is conducive to encountering\nfire. Crucially this can happen in us (even though we do have the\nconcept of \u201cfire\u201d) but it can happen in creatures without\nthe concept. Price captures this change by talking of an increased\nvigilance for fire (1953a: 120f). This is what \u201chaving in\nmind\u201d in such cases amounts to.\n\nPrice extensively relates sign-cognition also to logical notions, such\nas disjunction, conditionals, and negation (1953a: ch. 5; 1929\ndiscusses negation further); of this discussion, Beck (1953: 560)\nsays, \u201cPsychologically this is the most subtle part of his\n[1953a] book\u201d. Also, understanding thinking in this way, he\nargues, avoids presupposing other minds, blocking a common objection\nto communication\u2019s being our best evidence for other minds\n(1938: 440ff).\n",
