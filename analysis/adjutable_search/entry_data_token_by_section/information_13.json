    "main_text": "Developments in Philosophy of Information || Popper: Information as Degree of Falsifiability\n4.1 Popper: Information as Degree of Falsifiability\n\nThe research program of logical positivism of the Wiener Kreis in the\nfirst half of the twentieth century revitalized the older project of\nempiricism. Its ambition was to reconstruct scientific knowledge on\nthe basis of direct observations and logical relation between\nstatements about those observations. The old criticism of Kant on\nempiricism was revitalized by Quine (1951). Within the framework of\nlogical positivism induction was invalid and causation could never be\nestablished objectively. In his Logik der Forschung (1934)\nPopper formulates his well-known demarcation criterion and he\npositions this explicitly as a solution to Hume\u2019s problem of\ninduction (Popper 1934 [1977: 42]). Scientific theories formulated as\ngeneral laws can never be verified definitively, but they can be\nfalsified by only one observation. This implies that a theory is\n\u201cmore\u201d scientific if it is richer and provides more\nopportunity to be falsified:\n\n\nThus it can be said that the amount of empirical information conveyed\nby a theory, or its empirical content, increases with its\ndegree of falsifiability. (Popper 1934 [1977: 113], emphasis in\noriginal) \n\n\nThis quote, in the context of Popper\u2019s research program, shows\nthat the ambition to measure the amount of empirical information\nin scientific theory conceived as a set of logical statements was\nalready recognized as a philosophical problem more than a decade\nbefore Shannon formulated his theory of information. Popper is aware\nof the fact that the empirical content of a theory is related to its\nfalsifiability and that this in its turn has a relation with the\nprobability of the statements in the theory. Theories with more\nempirical information are less probable. Popper distinguishes\nlogical probability from numerical probability\n(\u201cwhich is employed in the theory of games and chance, and in\nstatistics\u201d; Popper 1934 [1977: 119]). In a passage that is\nprogrammatic for the later development of the concept of information\nhe defines the notion of logical probability:\n\n\nThe logical probability of a statement is complementary to its\nfalsifiability: it increases with decreasing degree of\nfalsifiability. The logical probability 1 corresponds to the degree 0\nof falsifiability and vice versa. (Popper 1934 [1977: 119],\nemphasis in original) \n\nIt is possible to interpret numerical probability as applying to a\nsubsequence (picked out from the logical probability relation) for\nwhich a system of measurement can be defined, on the basis of\nfrequency estimates. (Popper 1934 [1977: 119], emphasis in original)\n\n\n\nPopper never succeeded in formulating a good formal theory to measure\nthis amount of information although in later writings he suggests that\nShannon\u2019s theory of information might be useful (Popper 1934\n[1977], 404 [Appendix IX, from 1954]). These issues were later\ndeveloped in philosophy of science. Theory of conformation studies\ninduction theory and the way in which evidence \u201csupports\u201d\na certain theory (Huber 2007\n [OIR]).\n Although the work of Carnap motivated important developments in both\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of information the connection\nbetween the two disciplines seems to have been lost. There is no\nmention of information theory or any of the more foundational work in\nphilosophy of information in Kuipers (2007a), but the two disciplines\ncertainly have overlapping domains. (See, e.g., the discussion of the\nso-called Black Ravens Paradox by Kuipers (2007b) and Rathmanner &\nHutter (2011).) \n",
