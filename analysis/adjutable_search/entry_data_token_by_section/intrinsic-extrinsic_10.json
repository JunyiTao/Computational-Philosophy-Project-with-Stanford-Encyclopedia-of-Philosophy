    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis || Broadly Logical Theories\n3.1 Broadly Logical Theories\n\nIt would be good if we could analyse intrinsicality using only broadly\nlogical notions, where broadly logical notions are exhausted by the\nnarrowly logical notions of conjunction, negation and existential\nquantification, the modal notion of metaphysical possibility, the\nmereological notion of parthood, and the basic notions associated with\nproperty theory and set theory, such as the notions expressed by\n\u2018state of affairs\u2019, \u2018property\u2019,\n\u2018relation\u2019, \u2018possible world\u2019,\n\u2018instantiates\u2019, \u2018is a member of\u2019 and\n\u2018set\u2019. (The locution \u2018state of affairs\u2019 is\nused differently by different philosophers. Here it is being used to\nrefer to the zero-place analogues of one-place properties and multiple\nplace relations. Just as a property is a way of a thing is or fails to\nbe, a state of affairs, under our usage, is a way things are or fail\nto be.)\n\nIt is at least initially appealing to think that, if an object has a\nproperty in an intrinsic fashion, then it has it independently of the\nway the rest of the world is. The rest of the world could disappear,\nand the object might still have that property. Hence a lonely\nobject, an object that doesn\u2019t coexist with any contingent\nobjects wholly distinct from it, could have the property. Many\nextrinsic properties, on the other hand, cannot be possessed by lonely\nobjects \u2013 no lonely object has the property of being six metres\nfrom a rhododendron, for example. This suggests an analysis of\nintrinsicality: \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff it is possible for\na lonely object to be \\(F\\). This analysis is usually attributed to\nKim (1982) (e.g. in Lewis 1983a and Sider 1993), though Humberstone\n(1996) dissents from this interpretation. If this analysis is\nsuccessful then it would constitute a broadly logical analysis, since\nthe expressions on the right hand side of the account can each be\ndefined using only broadly logical vocabulary.\n\nThe major problem with this analysis is that the \u2018if\u2019\ndirection of the biconditional is clearly false. As Lewis (1983)\npointed out, it is possible for a lonely object to have the property\nof being lonely, but the property of being lonely is not\nintrinsic.\n\nOne might try to deal with this problem by adding extra modal\nconditions to the above account. Say that a property \\(F\\) is\nindependent of accompaniment iff the following four\nconditions (taken from Langton and Lewis 1998) are met:\n\nPossibly, there exists a lonely \\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists a lonely non-\\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists an accompanied (i.e. not lonely) \\(F\\)\nPossibly, there exists an accompanied non-\\(F\\)\n\n\nAt first glance, if \\(F\\) is intrinsic, then whether or not an object\nhas \\(F\\) should not depend on whether it is lonely. If this is right,\nthen all four of these conditions should be satisfied. We might\ntherefore try to give the following broadly logical analysis: \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic iff \\(F\\) is independent of accompaniment.\n\nAs Langton and Lewis (1998) point out, however, this strengthened\nanalysis still fails (see also Lewis 1983a). Given intrinsic\nproperties, such as being a cube, are independent of accompaniment,\nthe extrinsic property of being either a lonely cube or an accompanied\nnon-cube is also independent of accompaniment. Hence, provided the\nstrengthened analysis correctly classifies being a cube as\nintrinsic, it will falsely classify being either a lonely cube or\nan accompanied non-cube as intrinsic.\n\nIn the face of this failure, we might still hope that a yet more\nsophisticated broadly logical analysis might succeed. An argument due\nto Marshall 2009 and Parsons 2001, however, shows that, given standard\nviews about what is possible, and given the absence of special\nassumptions about the abundance and structure of properties, no such\nanalysis can be given. This argument considers the intrinsic property\nof being an electron and the extrinsic property of being either an\naccompanied electron or a lonely positron. It then shows that, given\ncertain common views about properties and possibility, these\nproperties have the same pattern of instantiation through logical,\nmereological and set-theoretic space. Since formulas containing only\nbroadly logical expressions cannot distinguish between properties\nhaving the same such pattern, it then follows that no broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsically is possible.\n\nTo give more of an idea of how this argument works, suppose for\nsimplicity that there are only three possible worlds, \\(w_1\\), \\(w_2\\)\nand \\(w_3\\), and only four possible individuals \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\),\n\\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\). Suppose further that: \n\nAt \\(w_1\\), \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are the only things that exist,\n\\(x_1\\) is an electron and \\(x_2\\) is a positron \n\nAt \\(w_2\\), \\(x_3\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_3\\) is an\nelectron \n\nAt \\(w_3\\), \\(x_4\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_4\\) is a\npositron. \n\nNow assume a possible worlds theory of properties, according to which\nthe property of being \\(F = \\{\\langle x, w\\rangle \\mid x \\text{ is } F\n\\text{ at } w\\}\\). Given this theory of properties:\n\n\\(q_1\\) = Being an electron = \\(\\{\\langle x_1, w_1 \\rangle, \\langle\nx_3, w_2\\rangle\\}.\\) \n\n\\(q_2\\) = Being either an accompanied electron or a lonely positron =\n\\(\\{\\langle x_1, w_1\\rangle, \\langle x_4, w_3\\rangle\\}.\\) \n\nSuppose, for reductio, that the notion of an intrinsic property can be\nanalysed in terms of broadly logical notions. Then, since analyses\nmust be necessary, there is a formula \\(\\varphi(p)\\) such that (A) is\nnecessarily true, where \\(\\varphi\\) contains only broadly logical\nvocabulary, such as variables, brackets, \u2018&\u2019,\n\u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019, \u2018is a\npossible world\u2019, \u2018at\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\in\\)\u2019.\n\n(A)\n \\(p\\) is intrinsic iff \\(\\varphi(p)\\). \n\n\nSince \\(q_1\\) is necessarily intrinsic, while \\(q_2\\) is necessarily\nnot intrinsic, it follows from the necessity of (A) that\n\\(\\varphi(q_1)\\) is necessarily true, while \\(\\varphi(q_2)\\) is\nnecessarily false. In other words, if there is a broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsicality, then there is a formula \\(\\varphi\\)\ncontaining only broadly logical vocabulary that necessarily applies to\n\\(q_1\\), and necessarily does not apply to \\(q_2\\). However, it can be\nproved that there is no such formula. For example, while\n\n\\[\\text{\u2018}\\exists w_1 \\exists w_2 \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\exists x_3(p =\n\\{\\langle w_1, x_1\\rangle , \\langle w_2, x_3\\rangle \\})\\text{\u2019}\\]\n\n\napplies to \\(q_1\\), it also applies to \\(q_2\\). Hence, the reductio\nassumption is false, and there is no broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality. This argument can easily be adapted to show that there\nis no broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality given more realistic\nassumptions about what possible worlds there are.\n\nIt is important to note that, despite the existence of the above\nargument, one might still be able to analyse intrinsicality in terms\nof broadly logical notions if one is prepared to make special (and\ncontroversial) assumptions about properties. As an illustration of\nthis, suppose one assumes that all intrinsic properties have no proper\nparts while all extrinsic properties do have proper parts. Then one\nmight give a broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality by giving\naccount (14).\n\n(14)\n \\(p\\) is an intrinsic property iff \\(p\\) is a property that has\nno proper parts.\n\n \nEven if an analysis like this one is true, however, its utility will\nbe limited. For example, unless we already know somehow which\nproperties have proper parts and which properties do not have proper\nparts, (14) will be useless in helping us to determine which\nproperties are intrinsic and which properties are non-intrinsic.\n\nTwo more sophisticated attempts to give a broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality are Yablo\u2019s contractionist account discussed in\nsection\n 3.4,\n and Francescotti\u2019s relational account, which is discussed in\nthe supplementary document:\n\nThe Relational Account of Intrinsicality.\n \n\nBoth these accounts rely on controversial assumptions about properties\nor related entities such as possible worlds. The most sophisticated\nattempt to give a purely broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality\nthat has yet been proposed is that of Plate 2018. A response to\nPlate\u2019s account is given in Marshall forthcoming.\n\nGiven that we cannot give a satisfactory account of intrinsicality\nusing only broadly logical notions, it is natural to investigate\nwhether we can give a satisfactory account using a larger set of\nnotions. In the next four subsections, we will consider whether\nintrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the notions of perfect\nnaturalness, non-disjunctivity, possible world contractions, or\nmetaphysical grounding.\n",
