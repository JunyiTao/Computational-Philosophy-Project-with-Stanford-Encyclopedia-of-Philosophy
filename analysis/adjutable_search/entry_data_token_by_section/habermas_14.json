    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || The Return of Habermas\u2019s Kantianism and the Morality/Ethics Distinction\n3.5 The Return of Habermas\u2019s Kantianism and the Morality/Ethics Distinction\n\nHabermas thus develops a distinctively social and intersubjective\nversion of ethics, different from Kant\u2019s. But certain\ndevelopments in phase two push back toward a Kantian conception of\ndiscourse ethics (Heath 2014: 846). In Between Facts and\nNorms, (U) is said to allow participants to agree on norms that\nare impartial, and that have \u201ccategorial validity\u201d (1992b\n[1996b: 28]). And Habermas appears to hold, like Kant, that the\nrational will is the source of moral obligation (1992b [1996b: 110];\nKettner 2002, 212). Furthermore, the moral domain, which in phase one\nencompassed the entire domain of action norms and values, later\n\u201cshrinks\u201d to a domain of thinner, universal moral norms\nwith characteristic overridingness and stringency (1991a chapter 6,\n202 [1993: 91]).\n\nIt is primarily Habermas\u2019s introduction of a tripartite typology\nof practical reason\u2014the ethical, moral, and pragmatic\nemployments of practical reason\u2014that drives his return to Kant\nin Between Facts and Norms. In particular Habermas introduces\na notion of ethical discourse that differs from moral discourse in\nthat it addresses clinical questions such as \u201cWhat is the good\nlife (for me, or for us)?\u201d and that is restricted in scope to\ncommunities with shared values. Ethical discourses differ, he claims,\nfrom moral discourses which deal with questions of justice, understood\nas what is equally in the interests of all (1983 [1990: 180]; 1991a\nchapter 5, 101\u2013105 [1993: chapter 1, 3\u20138]; 1996a essay 1:\n39\u201340 [1998a: 26\u20137]). He understands \u201cjustice\u201d\nnot as a political value, as the later Rawls does, but as the supreme\nmoral value, and the designated value of moral discourse, on analogy\nwith truth for theoretical discourse. Although he allows that many\nquestions can be addressed by both ethical and moral discourses, he\ndraws a sharp distinction between them and accords priority to\nmorality over ethics (1983 [1990: 104]; 1991a chapter 5, 100\u2013119\n[1993: chapter 1, 1\u201317]). Ethical discourses always take place\nwithin the bounds of moral permissibility, and on Habermas\u2019s\naccount no moral norm can be weighed against, or trumped by, any\nethical value. Along with various communitarians, Charles Taylor and\nMartin Seel both criticize Habermas on this point and defend the idea\nthat the good (albeit construed in different ways) has priority over\nthe morally right (Taylor 1989 [1992]; Seel 1995).\n\nThe ethics/morality distinction has also been a target of much\ncriticism. Benhabib (1986), McCarthy (1991; chapter 7: 181\u2013200);\nPutnam (2002); and Kettner (2002), among others have shown that\nHabermas cannot and does not maintain a sharp distinction between the\ntwo. The main reason they give is that the notion of value that\nHabermas associates with ethics bleeds into his conception of a valid\nmoral norm. Indeed, Habermas himself acknowledges the existence of\nwhat he calls a \u201chidden link\u201d between justice and the\ncommon good (1983 [1990: 202]), and \u201cthe remnant of the good at\nthe core of the right\u201d (\u201cdas Gute im Gerechten\u201d)\n(1996a essay 1: 43 [1998a: 29]). And he appears to think of this\nrelation, not as threat to his conception of morality but as a feature\nof it, namely that it rests on an underlying web of solidary relations\nbetween human beings. Habermas claims that morality arose from this\nweb of solidarity as a process of generalization and universalization\nin the course of modernization, and, he claims, although solidarity\nremains as the other side of justice (qua moral rightness)\nthis does not smudge the bright line between ethics and morality\n(Habermas 1986a [1990b]).\n\nKettner objects that Habermas\u2019s typology is dogmatic,\nestablished by \u201cterminological fiat\u201d and that it should\nnot be seen as an insight into the nature of practical reason (Kettner\n2002: 208). Few critics are prepared to defend Habermas\u2019s\ndistinction with the notable exception of Rainer Forst (Forst 2007\n[2011: 60\u201379]). In the final analysis, Habermas settles on the\nview of discourse ethics in general, and (U) in particular, as a\nreconstruction of an alternative to Kant\u2019s first formula of the\nCategorical Imperative that is allegedly superior to the latter in\nvirtue of being dialogical rather than monological and the\nreconstruction of an actual practice involving real moral agents.\n",
