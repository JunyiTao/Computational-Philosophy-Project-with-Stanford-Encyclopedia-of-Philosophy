Capacities like the one for norms are understood\nas complex in the sense that they are subserved by a number of\nsimpler, interrelated processes and subsystems. Such complex systems\nare usefully analyzed by reference to those simpler ones that comprise\nthem. When used in psychology, this general method of analyzing\ncomplex systems by appeal to the character and interactions of their\ncomponent parts often takes the form of what has been called\nhomuncular functionalism (Lycan 1990), where it is paired with the\nmetaphysical doctrine of functionalism about the mind. This, briefly\nstated, is the view that mental states and processes are functional\nstates, identified by the characteristic role they play in the\npsychological system of which they are a part (Putnam 1963, 1967;\nFodor 1968; Levin 2004 [2018]). Dennett, an early proponent of\nhomuncular functionalism, urged psychologists to follow a method\nparallel to that used in artificial intelligence research:\n\n\nThe AI researcher starts with an intentionally characterized\nproblem (e.g., how can I get a computer to understand\nquestions of English?), breaks it down into sub-problems that are also\nintentionally characterized (e.g., how do I get the computer to\nrecognize questions, distinguish subjects from\npredicates, ignore irrelevant parsing?) and then breaks these\nproblems down further until he reaches problem or task descriptions\nthat are obviously mechanistic. (Dennett 1978: 80)\n\n\nAn important step in any explanation is delineating the target\nphenomena itself. In cognitive science, this step often takes the form\nof characterizing a capacity via task analysis, which amounts to\nidentifying and distinguishing the tasks or functions that\nare performed in exercising the relevant capacity. For example, some\ntasks currently thought to be central to the functioning of a norm\nsystem include those mentioned above: acquisition, compliance, and\nenforcement. Another step is concerned with modeling the\npsychological mechanisms responsible for carrying out those\ntasks: the typical algorithms and patterns of information processing\nthat perform those functions. The final step in completing a full\naccount of a capacity would be an explanation of how those mechanisms\nand algorithms are implemented and thus realized in the\nperson\u2019s physical, chemical, and biological structures (see Marr\n1982 for the classical discussion of these different levels of\nexplanation).\n\nWhile experimental and other behavioral evidence can help to more\ndirectly characterize a capacity and identify its associated tasks,\nmany theoretically important issues have to do with determining what\nkind of psychological mechanisms should be posited to account for\nthem. Theorists defending different views might hypothesize different\nmechanisms that underpin a particular capacity, or give different\naccounts of how a mechanism performs its function. They can also agree\nor disagree about how the relevant mechanisms are organized,\ndeveloping different accounts of their proprietary algorithms, and the\ntypes of causal and informational links each bears to each other and\nto other elements of a person\u2019s overall psychological economy\n(perceptual systems, short term memory, action production systems,\netc.).\n\nWithin this conceptual space there are number of prominent dimensions\nalong which accounts might vary. The following list of such dimensions\nis not exhaustive, but it gives a sense of some of the most\nsignificant ones. The psychological mechanisms posited by different\nproximate accounts of a norm system can differ with respect to\n\n Whether and to what extent they are fast, automatic, intuitive,\nnon-conscious, or otherwise fit the description of \u201ctype\n1\u201d cognition, or are slow, controlled, effortful, conscious, or\notherwise fit the description of \u201ctype 2\u201d cognition\n Whether and to what extent they bear the markings of modularity,\ni.e., are cognitively impenetrable, informationally encapsulated,\ndomain specific, etc.\n Whether and to what extent they require or are subject to\nvoluntary control\n Whether and to what extent mechanisms and their content are\nuniversal aspects of human psychological nature, or instead exhibit\nvariation across habitats and cultures\n Whether and to what extent the mechanisms and their content are\ninnate, genetic adaptations, or are instead socially learned and\nculturally transmitted\n Whether and to what extent the motivation associated with the\nmechanisms is intrinsic or instrumental\n\n\nThe first dimension concerns a distinction between type 1 and\ntype 2 cognitive processes made by dual processing and dual\nsystems theories (see Frankish 2010 for a review, Cushman, Young,\n& Greene 2010). Type 1 processes are typically characterized as\n\u201cfast and frugal,\u201d intuitive, heuristic processes which\ndeliver \u201crough-and-ready\u201d responses (Gigerenzer et al.\n2000). These processes take place automatically and unconsciously and\nare prone to error, but they make up in speed and resource-efficiency\nwhat they lack in precision. Type 2 processes, by contrast, are\ntypically characterized as slower, rule-based, analytical processes\nwhich require more concentration and cognitive effort, take place\nconsciously, and deliver more precise responses.\n\nThe second dimension concerns the view that the mind is, to some\ndegree, made up of modules: psychological mechanisms that are\ninformationally encapsulated, fairly autonomous, automatic, and\ndomain-specific (Fodor 1983; Carruthers 2006; Robbins 2009 [2017]).\nModules are informationally encapsulated in the sense that they are\ninsensitive to information present in the mind but not contained\nwithin the mechanism itself, leaving their internal processes\nunaffected by, for example, what the person reflectively believes or\nprefers. A related property is cognitive impenetrability. This\ncaptures the fact that the information and processes inside a module\nare themselves inaccessible to central systems, such as those involved\nin introspection or deliberation. Although it is often possible to\nconsciously consider the output of a modular mechanism, the endogenous\nprocesses responsible for producing that output will remain opaque to\ndirect introspection (Carruthers 2011).\n\nTurning to the third dimension, it should be clear how commitments\nalong the first two dimensions could support different views about the\nextent to which normatively governed expectations and behavior require\nor are susceptible to voluntary control. If the processes subserving\nthe capacity for norms are to some degree automatic and unconscious,\nand are insensitive to changes a person makes to her explicit beliefs,\njudgments, or volitions, those processes would be able to affect her\nbehavior without the need of any guidance from her will, and could\nhelp produce behaviors and judgments that oppose it. Research on\nimplicit bias may provide useful resources for thinking about the\nrelationship between normative cognition and voluntary control. Recent\nwork sheds light on what kind of intervention strategies are effective\n(Lai et al. 2014; Devine et al. 2012), and suggests that deliberate\ncognitive effort and voluntary control can, under certain conditions,\noverride the influence of implicit and automatic cognition. Turning to normative cognition, research\nsuggests that self-control may be required to violate a norm one has\ninternalized, such as the norm against breaking promises (Baumgartner\net al. 2009), but the details remain unclear (Peach, Yoshida, &\nZanna 2011; Yoshida et al. 2012; also see Kelly forthcoming for\ndiscussion of differences between internalized and avowed norms).\n\nThe fourth and fifth dimensions are where the traditional\nnature/nurture debate plays out with respect to norms and normative\npsychology. It is part of the standard account of modules that they\nare innate in the sense that they will develop in more or less the\nsame way in normal humans, irrespective of cultural setting. Advocates\nof so-called Evolutionary Psychology, one especially visible way of\napplying evolutionary thought to human behavior, have embraced the\nidea of modules, even arguing that human minds are \u201cmassively\nmodular\u201d, i.e., composed exhaustively or almost entirely of\nmodular psychological mechanisms (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992;\nSamuels 1998; Carruthers 2006). On such a view, normative psychology\nwill also be modular in many respects. One way to develop this idea\nwould be to make the case that all human cultures are structured by\nsome set of norms or another, suggesting the presence of modular\ncognition. The ways in which norms differ from one group to the next\nmight then be explained by appeal to an evoked culture model\n(Tooby & Cosmides 1992, though see Sperber 1996 for a different\naccount of the relationship between modular cognition and culture).\nAccording to this model, the norm-guided behaviors found across\ncultures would be construed as innately constrained, rooted in\nendogenous mental form and content of the \u201ccognitive adaptations\nfor social exchange\u201d common to all human minds. Normative\nvariation, then, would be explained by appeal to the fact that\ndifferent groups live in different circumstances, and variation in the\nexternal conditions they face evokes different subsets of the set of\nall norms and norm-governed behaviors made possible by the norm\nsystem. Such a view has been suggested but not yet fully worked out\n(though see Buchanan & Powell 2018). An alternative family of\nviews puts the ideas of innateness and domain-specificity to different\nuses (Fessler & Machery 2012). These, which have been more\ndeveloped for normative psychology, depict humans as having an innate\ncapacity dedicated to acquiring and performing norms, but whose\nunderlying mechanisms contain little if any innately specified\ncontent. No particular norms would be innate on such a view; rather,\nthe capacity (perhaps together with some set of learning biases)\nguides acquisition in its specific domain, and thus equips individuals\nto easily internalize whatever norms are present in her local social\nenvironment (Boyd & Richerson 2005a; Sripada & Stich 2007;\nChudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018).\n\nA general alternative to these kinds of nativist, modular views has\nrecently been developed in more detail. It holds that psychological\nmechanisms bearing many characteristics of type 1 processes might be\nlearned cognitive gadgets rather than innate cognitive\ninstincts or modules. On this account, a complex capacity\u2014for,\nsay, reading and writing or playing chess\u2014is still underpinned\nby a number of relatively integrated psychological mechanisms and\nroutinized processes, but these mechanisms themselves (as opposed to\nmerely the content they process) are fashioned and bundled together by\ncultural evolution. These packages of skills, once available in the\ngroup\u2019s cultural repertoire, can then be acquired by individuals\nvia domain general learning processes (Heyes 2018). The idea of a\ncognitive gadget provides a promising new theoretical option for\npsychology in general. Its advocates have not yet systematically\naddressed the question of whether it best captures the capacity for\nnorms, however (though see Sterelny 2012 chapter 7 for a discussion\nthat anticipates this line of thought).\n\nOthers interested in moral cognition more generally\u2014which\noutstrips work on norm-guided behavior to include work on the\npsychology of altruism, well-being, character and virtue, moral\nemotions, intentional versus unintentional action, and so\nforth\u2014have sought to develop an analogy between Chomskyan\ntheories of language acquisition and use, on one hand, and the\nacquisition and application of moral rules, on the other (Mikhail\n2007, 2011; Dwyer, Huebner, & Hauser 2010; Hauser, Young, &\nCushman 2008; Roedder & Harman 2010).  This approach is generally\nnativist, positing a universal moral competence that guides learning\nspecifically in the domain of morality, and contains enough innately\nspecified structure to account for the putative poverty of moral\nstimulus that children face when attempting to learn the norms that\nprevail in their local environment (see Laurence & Margolis 2001\nfor discussion of poverty of the stimulus arguments in cognitive\nscience). Some advocates also suggest that in addition to information\nspecifying the structure of the mechanisms dedicated to acquiring and\nprocessing moral norms, a few particular norms themselves may also be\nincluded as part of the innate moral capacity, perhaps norms against\nincest or intentionally causing harm (e.g., Mikhail 2007,\n2011). Others have criticized this view (Prinz 2008; Sterelny 2012),\nbut only recently has a more detailed positive account of rule\nacquisition begun to be developed. Central to this newly emerging\nempiricist alternative is the idea that individuals are rational rule\nlearners, but they rely on domain general learning strategies to\nacquire norms from their social environment, rather than on an\ninnately specified, domain specific moral competence (Gaus &\nNichols 2017; Ayars & Nichols 2017, 2020; Nichols\nforthcoming.)\n\nThe sixth and final dimension concerns motivation. Especially in light\nof the roles that punishment and reward play in the stabilization of\ngroup-level patterns of behavior, an initially plausible idea is that\nnormative motivation is instrumental (for discussion see Fehr\n& Falk 2002). On such views, an individual conforms to a norm in\norder to receive some benefit, or to avoid reprimand, or because she\nwants to behave in the way she thinks others expect her to behave.\nSuch motivation would be instrumental in the sense that people obey\nnorms merely as a means to some further end that more fundamentally\ndrives them; in counterfactual terms, remove the external reward,\npunishment, or social expectation, and the individual\u2019s norm\ncompliant behavior will disappear along with it. Those who explore\nthis kind of account have recently emphasized the role of\npsychological states like conditional preferences, together with\n2nd order social beliefs, i.e., people\u2019s beliefs\nabout other people\u2019s expectations, and people\u2019s beliefs\nabout other people\u2019s beliefs about what should be done (see\nBicchieri, Muldoon, & Sontuoso 2018 for discussion of such a\nfamily views).\n\nOther accounts construe normative motivation as intrinsic\n(Kelly & Davis 2018; Nichols forthcoming,\nespecially chapter 10). On such a\nview, once a norm is acquired and internalized, it typically becomes\ninfused with some kind of non-instrumental motivation. People will be\nmotivated to comply with and enforce a such rule for its own sake, and\nexperience an impetus to do so that is independent of external\ncircumstances or the perceived likelihood that they will receive\nsocial sanctions even if they flout the norm. Intrinsic motivation\ndoes not imply unconditional behavioral conformity, of course. For\nexample, a person may feel the intrinsic pull of a norm that\nprescribes leaving a 20% tip, but still choose to override it and\ninstead act out of material self-interest, stiffing the waiter. This\nsecond family of accounts raises a broader set of questions about the\npsychological nature of normative motivation, and if and how it might\nbe special. Is normative motivation best treated as a primitive, its\nown sui generis psychological category? Or is it better\nconstrued as being generated by more familiar psychological elements\nlike desires, emotions, drives, or other types of conative states,\nposited on independent grounds, that are recruited to work in\nconjunction with normative psychology? (see Kelly 2020 for\ndiscussion)\n\nAn early and influential account of the psychology of norms given by\nSripada and Stich (2007) illustrates how these kinds of theoretical\npieces might be put together. The preliminary model posits two innate\nmechanisms, a norm acquisition mechanism and a norm\nexecution mechanism. The functions or tasks of the norm\nacquisition mechanism are\n\n to identify behavioral cues indicating the existence of\na norm\n to infer the content of that norm, and finally\n to pass information about that content on to a norm\nexecution mechanism\n\n\nThe tasks of the norm execution mechanism, on the other hand, are\n\n to encode and store those norms passed along to\nit by the acquisition system in a norm database, which may\nhave some proprietary processes for reasoning about the contents\nrepresented therein\n to detect cues in the immediate environment that\nindicate if any of those norms apply to the situation, and if so to\nwhom\n to generate motivation to comply with those norms that\napply to oneself,\n to generate motivation to punish those who violate norms\nthat apply to them\n\n\nSripada and Stich provide an initial pictorial representation:\n\n\n\nFigure: Sripada & Stich 2007: 290,\nfigure redrawn.\n [An\n extended description of the figure\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe acquisition and execution mechanisms themselves are posited as\ninnate, but are highly sensitive to the local social setting in which\nan individual develops. As described above, this bifurcation into\ninnate psychological architecture, on the one hand, and socially\nlearned normative content, on the other, is taken to explain why the\npresence of norms is culturally universal, whereas the behaviors,\nroles, and social arrangements governed by those norms exhibit\nvariation. In addition, the model depicts the operation of many\ncomponents of the norm system as \u201cautomatic and\ninvoluntary\u201d (Sripada & Stich 2007: 290), but takes no stand\non particular processes or more granular characteristics associated\nwith modularity or dual processing. Finally, the model is designed to\naccommodate evidence suggesting that when a norm is acquired and\nrepresented in the database it thereby gains a distinctive kind of\nmotivational profile. Specifically, this profile construes normative\nmotivation as\n\n intrinsically as opposed to instrumentally motivating\n both self- and other-oriented\n potentially powerful\n\n\nOn this account, normative motivation has the third property in the\nsense that in some cases it is capable of overpowering even fairly\ncompelling motivations that pull in conflicting directions; extreme\nexamples include suicide bombers overriding their instincts for\nself-preservation, or other fanatics who expend significant resources\nto enforce their favored norms on others. The self- and\nother-directedness of normative motivation captures the idea that the\nnorm system produces motivation to keep one\u2019s own behavior in\ncompliance with a norm as well as motivation to enforce it by\npunishing others who violate it.\n\nFinally, the model depicts normative motivation as intrinsic in the\nusual sense that people comply with norms as ultimate ends, or for\ntheir own sake. Sripada and Stich suggest that intrinsic motivation\nhelps explain a property of norms they call \u201cindependent\nnormativity\u201d. This marks the fact that norms can exert reliable\ninfluence on people\u2019s behavior even when those norms are not\nwritten down or formally articulated in any formal institution, and\nthus not enforced via any official mechanisms of punishment and reward\n(also see Davidson & Kelly 2020). They also discuss motivation and\nindependent normativity in terms of an \u201cinternalization\nhypothesis\u201d drawn from sociology and anthropology, and suggest\nthat the idea of internalization can be interpreted in terms of their\nmodel. On this story, a person has internalized a norm when it has\nbeen acquired by and represented in her norm database. The\ninternalization hypothesis can then be construed as a claim that\ninternalized norms are intrinsically motivating for the simple reason\nthat it is a fundamental psychological feature of normative psychology\nthat once a norm has been acquired, delivered to, and represented in a\nperson\u2019s norm database, the norm system automatically confers\nthis distinctive motivational profile on the norm. Being accompanied\nby self- and other-directed intrinsic motivation is part of the\nfunctional role a rule comes to occupy once it is represented in the\ndatabase of a person\u2019s norm system\u2014when it is\n\u201cinternalized\u201d\u2014in something analogous to the way\nthat being accompanied by avoidance motivation and contamination\nsensitivity is part of the functional role a cue comes to occupy once\nit is represented in a person\u2019s disgust system (Kelly 2011; also\nsee Gavrilets & Richerson 2017 for a computational model exploring\nthe evolution of norm internalization and the kinds of selective\nforces that may have given normative psychology this intriguing\ncharacteristic).\n",
