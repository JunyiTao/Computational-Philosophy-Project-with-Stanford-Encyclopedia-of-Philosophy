    "main_text": "Philosophy: Following the Thread of Intuition || The New Wisdom\n5.3 The New Wisdom\n\n\nWe examine first the theoretical discussions (following Langermann\n2005, 286\u2013302). In the chapter dealing with demonstration\n(burhan), Ibn Kammuna lists the seven types of judgment\n(hukm) by means of which one asserts or verifies\n(tasdiq) premises that are to be employed in a syllogism.\nH\u0323adsiyy\u0101t, intuitive judgments, are the last on the list,\nand Ibn Kammuna defines them simply as \u201cwhat the soul judges\nto be certain on the basis of evidence (qara\u2019in) other\nthan that found in the [six] sources (mabadi\u2019) that have\nbeen mentioned above\u201d (al-Kabisi 1982, 196; author\u2019s\ntranslation). Ibn Sina does not include h\u0323adsiyy\u0101t in his\nclassification of premises; Suhraward\u012b does include\nh\u0323adsiyy\u0101t in two of his lists, but neither is identical\nto the one found in al-Jad\u012bd. Despite all of these\ndevelopments, however, Ibn Kammuna supplies here exactly the same\ntime-worn example used by Ibn Sina (and before him by Aristotle), i.e.,\nthe fact that the moon\u2019s light derives from the sun.\n\n\nIn a later section of The New Wisdom Ibn Kammuna reproduces\nalmost word-for-word the final definition of h\u0323ads given by Ibn\nSina in his Pointers (al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t), one of his later\nwritings. He begins by noting that progress from first intelligibles to\nsecondary ones can be either by means of fikr (cogitation or\nreflection) or by h\u0323ads, \u201cin that the middle term\npresents itself to the mind all at once, either as the result of a\nsearch and desire [shawq] for it, without any [corresponding]\nmotion [of the soul], or without any impulse [ishtiyaq] or\nmotion.\u201d Ibn Kammuna continues, \u201cAlong with it, the\nobject of the search [i.e. the conclusion of the syllogism] and that\nwhich it entails present themselves. There is no difference between\nreflection and intuition, other than the presence of motion in\nreflection and its absence in intuition\u201d [ed. 441].\n\n\nIt is not difficult to find numerous examples of the application of\nh\u0323ads in The New Wisdom; it has much harder to see how\nh\u0323ads is to be integrated consistently into a comprehensive\nscientific program. Here follow some items of knowledge that are said\nto derive from h\u0323ads. H\u0323ads indicates to astronomers,\neven where logical necessity does not, that the planets require more\nthan one orb in order to complete their motions [ed. 402]. In the life\nsciences, we know by means of h\u0323ads that irrational animals\ncarry out their biological functions unconsciously [ed. 424]. As for\nmetaphysics and psychology, we conclude by means of h\u0323ads that\nintellect is more perfect than soul [ed. 517], and that bodies (or\ntheir species) are but shadows of spiritual entities [ed. 522].\nH\u0323ads and repeated experience (tajriba) together\nindicate that the body is the only impediment to the soul\u2019s conjunction\nwith the pure forms [ed. 492].\n\n\nThe last example is particularly important because it illustrates\nthe intimate connection between h\u0323ads and tajriba, a\nconnection maintained by Ibn Kammuna (and others) throughout.\nTajriba is the most usual justification for the knowledge\nclaimed by astrologers and alchemists. Hence both h\u0323ads and\ntajriba aim to function as sources for hidden knowledge within\nscientific systems that are based upon (ultimately) Aristotelian logic.\nAlthough it is repeatedly invoked as the source for scientific\nknowledge, h\u0323ads is not a tool of scientific inquiry, but\nrather a way of explaining, post facto, how a thinker hit upon\nthe solution to a difficult problem. As such its function in science is\nvery much the same as its function in explaining religious inspiration\nand prophecy.\n",
