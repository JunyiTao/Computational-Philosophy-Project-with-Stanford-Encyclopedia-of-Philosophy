History\n\nThe label \u201ccollective intentionality\u201d is fairly recent (in\nits current meaning, it was introduced by John Searle in his 1990\npaper \u201cCollective Intentions and Actions\u201d). In contrast to\nthe label, the concept is not new. The idea of collective\nintentionality is implied in such notions as Aristotle\u2019s concept\nof koinon\u00eda (common striving), Jean-Jacque\nRousseau\u2019s collective will (volont\u00e9\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale), or in notions such as the spirit\nof peoples and related concepts as developed in German Idealism\nor the Historical School of Law. Somewhat more explicit conceptions of\ncollective intentionality can be found in early social and\nsociological theory\n (2.1),\n Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy\n (2.2),\n and in the works of Robin G. Collingwood and Wilfrid Sellars\n (2.3).\n These largely independent sources focus on key issues in the analysis\nof collective intentionality that persist through history into the\npresent.\n",
