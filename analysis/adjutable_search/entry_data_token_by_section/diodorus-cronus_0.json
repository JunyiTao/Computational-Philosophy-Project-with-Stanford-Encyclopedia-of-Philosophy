    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nDiodorus died around 284 BCE at Alexandria in Egypt. His date of\nbirth is unknown. It used to be common to consider him old enough to\nhave influenced Aristotle (died 322 BCE), but there are no strong\ngrounds for this. The dating was based largely on Aristotle\u2019s\nresponse in Metaphysics Theta 3 to the modal theory of\n\u2018the Megarics\u2019; but the theory discussed there differs from\nthat of Diodorus, who in any case (see below) should not necessarily be\nassumed to be a Megaric, however great his debt to the school that went\nunder that name. The best evidence tends rather to make Diodorus an\nolder contemporary of, and a living influence on, the first generation\nof the Stoic school, which began life ca 300 BCE. Zeno of\nCitium, the school\u2019s founder, is said to have been\na pupil of Diodorus (among others). Among Zeno\u2019s\nfellow-pupils in Diodorus\u2019s class is reported to have been Philo,\nhimself later a highly original logician in his own right (see\nthe entry on\n Dialectical School \nin this encyclopedia).\n\n\nDiodorus came from Iasos in the eastern Aegean. In terms of\naffiliation he is regularly spoken of in our sources as a\n\u2018Dialectician\u2019. How distinct this school was from the\n\u2018Megaric\u2019 school is a matter of dispute, and one testimony\ndoes speak of a certain \u2018Diodorus the Megaric\u2019 (see Denyer\n2002), who may well be Diodorus Cronus. But at all events no evidence\nthat we possess associates him in any way with the town of Megara,\nafter which the Megaric school was named. Apart from his birthplace, we\nhear of him as active at Athens in or around the last decade of the\nfourth century, and later at Alexandria. These were the two major\ncultural centres of the age.\n\n\n\u2018Cronus\u2019 was his nickname, said to have been inherited\nfrom his teacher Apollonius Cronus. It meant roughly \u2018old\nfogey\u2019. But Diodorus, far from being an old fogey, comes over as\na rather flamboyant and non-traditional figure. To prove a point about\nthe non-natural character of language (see 3 below), he renamed one of\nhis slaves \u2018Allam\u0113n\u2019 (not a randomly chosen sound but\na Greek conjunction favoured by logicians like Diodorus for introducing\nthe minor premise of a syllogism, \u2018But now \u2026\u2019). And\nin defiance of the male-centred customs of contemporary philosophical\neducation, he trained all five of his daughters in dialectic. His work\nin logic was so well known that, according to the Alexandrian poet\nCallimachus, even the crows on the rooftops recognized his wisdom,\ncawing out Diodorean questions about the soundness of a conditional.\nAnd his celebrated Master Argument, with which he sought to establish\nhis modal definitions, was said to be hotly debated even at dinner\nparties.\n\n\nThere is no evidence that he wrote anything, and the choice of oral\nargument rather than written exposition would fit his label\n\u2018Dialectician\u2019, which refers to the Socratic practice of\nquestion-and-answer philosophical discussion. According to the\nanecdotal tradition (not necessarily to be trusted), he died after\npublic humiliation at the court of the Alexandrian ruler Ptolemy Soter,\nhaving failed to solve a set of logical puzzles propounded there by the\nMegaric philosopher Stilpo.\n",
