    "main_text": "Biographical sketch\n1. Biographical sketch\nHerbart was born on May 4, 1776, in\nOldenburg.[1]\nHe displayed precocious philosophical talent, writing on the\nphilosophy of Wolff and Kant in his early teens. His early education\nemphasized music, which would be reflected in his later\nwritings.[2]\nHis first teacher was his mother, who home-schooled him for many\nyears, and later followed him to Jena, where he matriculated in\n1794. There he met Fichte, becoming a member of his inner\ncircle. Already by 1794, however, Herbart took a critical stance\ntowards the\n Wissenschaftslehre.[3]\n Still, it was Fichte who set the general\nproblem of Herbart\u2019s life work: the ego and self-consciousness\n(cf. James 1890, Vol. I: 353\u20134; Beiser 2014: 101).\nWhile working as a private tutor to a Swiss family from 1796 to\n1800, Herbart met Pestalozzi, the great Swiss educator and theorist of\npedagogy. Pestalozzi\u2019s critique of traditional instructional\nmeans and ends, and his emphasis on developing the pupil\u2019s\nautonomy, would permanently stamp Herbart\u2019s own pedagogic\nthought (Beiser 2014: 101). During this period, Herbart struggled to\nfind his way out of Fichte\u2019s shadow and discover his own system\n(Beiser 2014: 102\u20133). After personal trials involving his\nmother, Herbart moved to G\u00f6ttingen, where he passed his doctoral\nand habilitation exams, lecturing there from 1802\u20131804. In his\ninaugural lecture on Plato\u2019s theory of forms Herbart first\nmentions his \u201cmethod of relations\u201d, the logical basis for\nhis metaphysical thought (see Section 2,\nbelow). While at G\u00f6ttingen, he published the major\nworks, Allgemeine P\u00e4dagogik (General Pedagogy,\n1806a), Hauptpuncte der Metaphysik (Basic Points of\nMetaphysics, 1806b); and Allgemeine practische\nPhilosophie, 1808). When G\u00f6ttingen came under French\noccupation in 1806, Herbart\u2019s situation there grew increasingly\ndifficult.\nHe therefore gladly accepted an offer from K\u00f6nigsberg to\nbecome the second successor to Kant\u2019s chair in 1809 (Beiser\n2014: 130\u20131). From his outpost in East Prussia, he watched the\ntriumph of German Idealism and Romanticism with despair (Beiser 2014:\n93; see the preface to his [1822; SW V: 94]). His 1814 essay, with the\nacid title, \u201cConcerning My Quarrel with the Philosophy du\nJour [Ueber Meinen Streit mit der Modephilosophie dieser\nZeit]\u201d, attacks the philosophy of Schelling and its\nreliance on intellectual intuition (SW III: 317\u201352; cf. Beiser\n2014: 132\u20134). It was during his K\u00f6nigsberg years that\nHerbart developed his psychology in works like \u201cPsychological\nRemarks on the Doctrine of Tones\u201d (1811), the Lehrbuch zur\nPsychologie (Teaching Text for Psychology; 1816), and\nhis monumental Psychologie als Wissenschaft (Psychology\nas Science; two volumes, 1824, 1825). In 1833, Herbart returned\nto G\u00f6ttingen, where he resided until his death on August 14,\n1841.\n",
