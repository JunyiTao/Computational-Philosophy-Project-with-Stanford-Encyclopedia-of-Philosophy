    "main_text": "Indexicals || Impure Indexicals\n3.2 Impure Indexicals\n\nIn contrast to the pure indexicals, the reference of impure indexicals\nlike \u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, and \u2018it\u2019 or the\n\u2018true demonstratives\u2019 like \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018that\u2019 looks to be far less amenable to an analysis in\nterms of character. After all, what regular feature of a speech\ncontext might any of these terms serve to pick out? One option would\nbe to say that tokens of each of these simply refer to the\ndemonstratum of the context. But not only does that threaten to\nforce us to say that all of these terms effectively mean the same\nthing\u2014something which seems rather counterintuitive\u2014now \nwe also need to know what exactly serves to make something the\ndemonstratum in a context. And what are we to do when multiple such\nterms, or multiple instances of the same term, are used within the\nspan of a single utterance? Are we really to believe that contexts\ninvolve not just a demonstratum role, but also a first\ndemonstratum role, a second demonstratum role,\netc.?\n\nSeveral possible responses arise at this point. First, we might try to\ntake advantage of the fact that many uses of these terms are\naccompanied by ostensive gestures. So perhaps, as Kaplan (1978) and\nMcGinn (1981) both suggest, it is such gestures that serve to make\nobjects the demonstrata of contexts\u2014one per use of an impure\nindexical. This suggestion also gives us a rather natural way of\nunderstanding what makes something the first demonstratum as opposed\nto the second, and so on. On the other hand, this approach faces a\nrather obvious objection: many perfectly good uses of impure\nindexicals and demonstratives simply aren\u2019t accompanied by any sort of\nostensive gesture. That observation leads to a second possible\nresponse, one which is in many ways a generalization of this first:\nperhaps it is not the ostensive gesture itself that makes an object\nthe demonstratum, but rather what that gesture does. Gestures, we\nmight take it, serve to make objects salient in a context. So perhaps\nwhat matters is just that an object be particularly salient in a\ncontext; perhaps this is what serves to make it the demonstratum,\nwhether or not that salience is the direct result of an ostensive\ngesture.\n\nHoward Wettstein (1984) develops a view along these lines, and this\nsame sort of view has more recently been fleshed-out and defended by\nAllyson Mount (2008). The basic idea is that a term like\n\u2018she\u2019 refers to whoever counts as the most salient\nfemale in the context. Similar rules will apply to the other\nimpure indexicals. Problems start to arise, however, once we consider\nbare uses of \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019\u2014which\ndon\u2019t seem to contain any substantial information about the relevant\nsortal. While it might seem plausible enough that some object will\ncount as the maximally salient female in a context, it seems far less\nplausible that contexts will contain maximally salient objects\nsimpliciter, or without further qualification. What might\nserve to make an object maximally salient simpliciter? The\nnatural suggestion would seem to be: our interests. If anything is\ngoing to make an object maximally salient simpliciter, it\u2019s\npresumably going to be that we, as agents, have brought a certain set\nof interests to the conversational exchange. \n\nDialectically though,\nthis suggestion is problematic. For one thing, the interests of the\nspeaker and listener can easily diverge. So we need to know whose\ninterests, if either, trumps when those interests fail to align.\nOtherwise, all that we can say is that a certain object is maximally\nsalient relative to both a context and a particular agent\u2014but\nnot relative to a context itself, without further qualification. Mount\nspecifies that what we are interested in is mutual maximal\nsalience. But this threatens to make a great many uses of the\nimpure indexicals fail to refer when the speaker and listener\u2019s\ninterests diverge. What\u2019s more, as Mount herself notes, the view\nentails that reference fails in almost any instance where the listener\nhappens not to be paying attention to the speaker\u2019s utterance. Other\nways of precisifying the view face analogous worries, seemingly\nhanding too much control to either the speaker or the listener.\n\nThis brings us to a third possibility for how the impure indexicals\nrefer: perhaps, as Kaplan (1989a) suggests, token uses of the impure\nindexicals, like demonstratives and deictic uses of pronouns, refer to\nwhoever or whatever the speaker intends for them to refer to. Kaplan\nsees some continuity here with his earlier pointing-based approach,\nsince he takes it that such intentions (what he calls \u2018directing\nintentions\u2019) might well be thought of as the internal analogue\nof an externalized pointing. Still, the suggestion is more durable\nthan this earlier one; no explicit gesture is necessary for reference\nto succeed. Indeed, not only can we now account for uses of impure\nindexicals with no accompanying ostensive gesture, this sort of\nintentionalist theory can also allow for uses of impure indexicals to\nrefer to objects that aren\u2019t physically present in the context\u2014as \nthere is no block to speakers having intentions directed at such\nobjects. Since we do indeed use impure indexicals to refer to\nphysically and temporally distant objects, this looks like a\nsignificant advantage for Kaplan\u2019s \u2018intentionalist\u2019 theory\nof reference.\n\nNone of this is to say that Kaplan\u2019s view has been universally\nembraced. On the contrary, the view has often been thought to face a\nrather serious problem. We noted above that terms like the bare\ndemonstratives \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 look to be\nrather flexible in their application. Yet even these terms are not\ninfinitely flexible. Presumably, you cannot point directly\nand deliberately at a picture of David Cameron, utter (9), and succeed\nin referring to the picture of David Kaplan that you have tucked away\nin your desk drawer for just such occasions:\n\nThat is a picture of one of the most Hawaiian shirt-loving\nphilosophers of the twentieth century.\n\n\nThis is an instance of what has sometimes been called the\n\u2018Humpty Dumpty\n Problem\u2019.[9]\n Basically, any time we might be tempted to suggest that what token\nuses of some particular term mean or refer to depends on the speaker\u2019s\nintentions, the following sort of problem inevitably arises: unless we\nimpose some constraints on what those intentions can look like, then\nwe\u2019ll end up with seemingly absurd results, results like that the\ntoken use of \u2018that\u2019 in (9) really does refer to the\npicture of Kaplan you have tucked away in your desk.\n\nA slightly more complicated case, confusingly from an earlier\ntime-slice of Kaplan (i.e. Kaplan 1978) and used to help motivate the\npointing theory, can be used to make much the same point. Kaplan asks\nus to imagine a scenario where the speaker is sitting at her desk and\nher prized picture of Rudolf Carnap, which typically hangs on the wall\nbehind her, has been switched for a picture of Spiro Agnew. Failing to\nnotice the switch, and intending to use the term \u2018that\u2019 to\nrefer to her picture of Carnap, the speaker points behind herself,\ndirectly at the picture of Agnew, and utters (10):\n\nThat is a picture of one of the greatest philosophers of the\ntwentieth century.\n\n\nOn Kaplan\u2019s telling of things, (10) is false not in virtue of\nreference failing here. Rather, it is false in virtue of the speaker\u2019s\nhaving asserted something false of the actual picture hanging behind\nher, the picture of Agnew. Most philosophers have been inclined to\nagree about this (see King (2013) for an exception, however).\nImportantly, this case is slightly different from our (9) in that it\ndoesn\u2019t seem altogether implausible that the speaker here might\nalso intend for her use of \u2018that\u2019 to refer to\nwhatever picture is hanging behind her. After all, she is somehow\nconfused about what picture that is. This confusion might, therefore,\ngive the intentionalist some additional room to maneuver.\n\nOne possibility would be for the intentionalist to dispute the\nabove judgments and embrace the claim that the token uses of\n\u2018that\u2019 in (9) and (10) do in fact refer to the pictures of\nKaplan and Carnap, respectively (see Radulescu (forthcoming) for a\nresponse along these\n lines).\n Most intentionalists have not gone down this route, however. Instead,\nthey have either tried to restrict the range of intentions that count\nas properly \u2018referential\u2019, or else they have tried to\nimpose certain limitations on when speakers\u2019 intentions in fact\ndetermine reference. This first strategy has generally proceeded by\nappealing to certain considerations drawn from Paul Grice\u2019s (1957)\ntheory of meaning. The second, in contrast, has tended to try to\nderive the relevant constraints from the standing meanings of, or\nrules of use for, the impure indexicals and demonstratives. More\nrecently, some philosophers have also tried combining these two\napproaches.\n\nThe Gricean approach to reference was first clearly articulated by\nGail Stine (1978)\u2014though it had been alluded to by both Grice\nhimself and Keith Donnellan\n (1968).[10]\n The basic idea is that the relevant sorts of intentions for fixing\nthe reference of impure indexicals are, properly speaking, intentions\naimed at getting the listener to identify a particular object as the\nreferent. In keeping with Grice\u2019s broader theory of meaning, these\nintentions are posited to be even more complicated than just this: not\nonly are they aimed at getting the listener to identify some object as\nthe referent, they are also meant to be fulfilled in part on the basis\nof the listener\u2019s recognizing that this is how she is intended to\nact.\n\nHaving followed the Gricean line this far, now we need to ask: can the\nGricean thesis regarding the complexity of referential intentions\nsomehow cut off the threat of a collapse into Humpty Dumpty-ism? The\nanswer, according to the Gricean, is \u201cYes.\u201d More\nprecisely, the Gricean will claim that the speaker lacks a\ngenuinely referential intention in a case like (9), since she\nshould have no expectation that her listener will be in a position to\nrecover her intended referent. In a case like (10), however, she\ndoes look to have an intention for her listener to recover\nthe picture of Carnap as the referent. So how is the Gricean in any\nposition to help here? As Bach (1992) helpfully clarifies, the Gricean\nline really ought to run as follows: while genuinely referential, the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to refer to the picture of Carnap runs\nvia an intention to refer to whatever picture happens to be\nbehind her. That latter intention is meant to be recognized directly,\nwhereas the former can only be recognized indirectly, via the\nrecognition of both this latter intention and (in the good case) the\nfact that the picture behind the speaker actually is the picture of\nCarnap. So a better way of formulating the Gricean thesis when it\ncomes to reference is in terms of a primary/secondary distinction that\nreflects this sort of asymmetry: when there is a conflict between a\nprimary and secondary referential intention, and both are genuinely\nreferential, it is the primary one that serves to fix\n reference.[11]\n\nSo far, so good for the Gricean. But just how general is her solution\nto the Humpty Dumpty Problem? Can she, for instance, account for a\nspeaker who appears to be fully competent in a language like English,\nbut who mistakenly believes that everyone else can simply read off \nher referential intentions, directly? In other\nwords, consider a speaker who believes that her listener can read her\nmind regarding her referential intentions, though nothing else, and\nonly when she actually utters a demonstrative. Unless we rule out such\na speaker as broadly incompetent in speaking English, it would seem\nthat she can now succeed, according to the Gricean, in making a token\nof \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019 refer to whatever she\nlikes, on any occasion whatsoever. For this speaker can coherently\nintend for her listener to recover that object as the referent of her\nuse of the demonstrative, partly in virtue of recognizing this very\nintention, and regardless of what that object is. In other words,\ngiven some strange enough background beliefs, the Gricean predicts that a\nspeaker really can make a use of \u2018that\u2019 in an\nutterance like (9) refer to her picture of David Kaplan\u2014regardless \nof whether anyone short of a real clairvoyant would ever be\ncapable of recovering this referent. So the Gricean strategy to block\nintentionalism\u2019s collapse into Humpty Dumpty-ism won\u2019t fully\ngeneralize.\n\nPartly in response to worries like these, we might think that the\nright sort of response to the Humpty Dumpty Problem is not to up the\ncomplexity of referential intentions themselves, but rather to impose\nlimits on how particular sorts of terms\u2014even the true\ndemonstratives\u2014can be used to refer. Marga Reimer (1991, 1992)\noffers a suggestion along just these lines: when uses of the demonstratives\n\u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 are accompanied by ostensive\ngestures, then the referent itself must lie in the general direction\nindicated by that\n gesture.[12]\n When there is no gesture, then there is no such constraint. In other\nwords, Reimer re-emphasizes the apparently special connection between\ndemonstratives and gestures that earlier theorists tried to leverage\ninto a full theory of demonstrative-reference. This time, however,\nReimer suggests that we use this connection not to generate a complete\ntheory of demonstrative reference, but rather to impose some\nconstraints on the intentionalist theory. Those constraints, in turn,\nare what allows Reimer to make the intuitively correct predictions\nregarding (9) and (10): with respect to (9), she will say that one\ncannot succeed at pointing to one picture and referring to another\npicture, unless perhaps the first is a photograph of the second; with\n(10), she will say that the speaker intends both to refer to\nthe picture behind herself and to that of Carnap, but only one of\nthese satisfies the constraint associated with the gesture. Thus, only\none of these intentions is in a position to determine reference.\n\nTo be clear, Reimer\u2019s position is by no means incompatible with the\nGricean theory of referential intentions. One might, in fact, accept\nboth that there are substantive constraints on reference that derive\nfrom the meanings of the impure indexicals themselves, and also that\nreferential intentions are as the Gricean describes them to be. Bach\n(2017) has recently embraced such a view, for instance. That said, one\nshould demand an independent reason for adopting the Gricean thesis.\nFor it would seem that one can prevent a collapse into Humpty\nDumpty-ism simply by accepting that there are constraints on reference\nconventionally associated with particular impure indexicals; one thus\nno longer needs the Gricean thesis to rein in the scope of referential\nintentions. Still, it is perfectly reasonable to think that there are\ngoing to be plenty of more general theoretical reasons to prefer the\ncombination of these theories to a pure constraint-type approach like\nReimer\u2019s.\n",
