    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying || Addressee Condition\n1.3 Addressee Condition\n\n\nAccording to the addressee condition, lying requires that a person\nmake an untruthful statement to another person (or,\nstrictly speaking, to a believed other person, since one\nmight, e.g., mistake a waxed dummy for another person, and lie to it).\nThat is, lying requires that a person address another person\n(Simpson 1992, 626). According to L1, it is not possible for me to lie to\nno one whatsoever (i.e., not even myself), and it is not\npossible to lie to someone whom one is not addressing but whom one\nbelieves is listening in on a conversation. For example, if Mickey and\nDanny both believe that the F.B.I. is monitoring their telephone\nconversation, and Mickey says to Danny, \u201cThe pick-up is at\nmidnight tomorrow,\u201d with the intention of deceiving the FBI\nagents listening in, then Mickey is not lying to the F.B.I. agents\n(this is a \u201cbogus disclosure\u201d (Newey 1997, 115)).\n\n\nAccording to L1, it is possible to lie to a general\naudience. It is possible for a person to lie by publishing an\nuntruthful report about an event (Kant 1997, 203), or by making an\nuntruthful statement on a tax return, or by sending an untruthful\ne-mail to everyone on a mailing list, or by making an untruthful\nstatement in a magazine advertisement or a television commercial. In\nthese cases, the readers, hearers, watchers, etc., are the addressees.\n\n\nAccording to the addressee condition, lying necessarily involves\naddressing someone whom you believe to be a person capable of\nunderstanding your statement and forming beliefs on that basis. It is\nnot possible to lie to those whom you believe to be non-persons\n(goldfish, dogs, robots, etc.) or persons whom you believe cannot\nunderstand the statements that are made to them (infants, the insane,\netc., as well as those whom you believe cannot understand the language\nyou are speaking in). It is possible to lie to other persons via\nintermediaries which are not persons, however (e.g., entering false\nanswers to questions asked by a bank\u2019s ATM).\n",
