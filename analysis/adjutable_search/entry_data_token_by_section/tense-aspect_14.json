One line of studies has investigated (e.g., Ferretti\net al. 2007) the accessibility of event participants in English\nprogressive and simple sentences. They provide evidence that, in line\nwith the linguistic description provided above, the progressive\npresents an event from the inside, making participants, instruments\nand places fully accessible, whereas the simple forms present events\nas complete units and the event participants are less accessible.\nUsing picture selection/verification, Madden and Zwaan (2003) found\nthat participants were faster and more likely to choose a picture\nshowing a complete event, rather than a picture depicting an ongoing\nevent, after they had read a sentence with an accomplishment verb in\nthe simple past. This indicates that English speakers encode\naccomplishments in the simple past as complete events. This finding\nwas supported by a study by Anderson et al. (2008). They compared\naccomplishments describing a path such as Tom jogged/was jogging\nto the woods and then stretched when he got there. Participants\nlistened to these sentences while using a computer mouse to drag and\ndrop a human character in a visual scene. When hearing a sentence in\nthe past progressive, many drops took place at the beginning and the\ncenter of the path, whereas in the simple past most drops were at the\nend of the path. Interestingly, the differences were by no means\ncategorical. Even in the simple past condition, the character was in\nsome trials positioned well before the end of the path. This indicates\nthat accomplishments in the simple past are consistent with incomplete\nevents. \n\nAnother study relevant for the discussion in the previous sections is\nan ERP study on the imperfective paradox by Baggio et al. (2008). They\ninvestigated the processing of Dutch imperfective sentences such as\nhet meisje was een brief aan het schrijven (the girl was\nwriting a letter) which were either followed by a\n\nwhen-clause that made the culmination unlikely (when her\nfriend spilled coffee on the paper) or by a sentence which was\ncompatible with the attainment of the goal (when her friend spilled\ncoffee on the tablecloth). The first kind of sentences elicited larger\nsustained anterior negativities compared to sentences that were\ncompatible with the culmination. Moreover, the amplitude of the\nnegativity was correlated with the frequency with which participants\nresponded that the culmination was not reached. These findings\nindicate that a progressive sentence triggers a default inference to a\ncomplete event which can be canceled again, if the context so\nrequires. \n\nGrammatical aspect is subject to clear crosslinguistic differences.\nThis raises the question of whether the grammatical system has an\ninfluence on how we process language. In von Stutterheim et al. (2009)\nthe authors reported findings of a production study comparing event\ndescriptions of English, German and Dutch speakers that were elicited\nwhile they were watching and describing a silent video clip. Their\nstudy revealed clear differences between productions from the three\nlanguages. English speakers used the progressive to start event\ndescriptions well before the endpoint was visible (e.g., A car is\ngoing down a lane \u2026 to a farmhouse). Germans showed a\ndifferent behavior, relating their descriptions to the endpoint of a\nmotion event. It thus seems as if production is constrained by the\nlanguage in which it is realized. Recently, von Stutterheim et al.\n(2012) extended this line of research to a sample of seven languages\nand showed that the aspectual properties of a language influence how\nspeakers conceptualize events. It\u2019s not only that speakers of\ndifferent languages talked differently about motion events (e.g.,\nmention of endpoints), their language also had a clear influence on\ntheir viewing behavior while watching the movies and influenced their\nmemory capacity for those parts of the scene corresponding to\nendpoints. \nAs for comprehension, Bott and Hamm (2014)\ninvestigated how the aspectual system of a language influences\nprocessing difficulty. They compared coercion of German and English\naccomplishments which were modified by for \\(x\\) time\nadverbials. (58) is a sample item. \n58.\n\n(a)\n\nDer Architekt errichtete das Monument zwei Jahre lang, aber dann wurde ihm der Kredit gek\u00fcndigt.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe architect built the monument for two years, but then the bank canceled his credit.\n      \n\n\nIn the German experiments, condition (58a) was read as fast as a\nnon-coercing control condition with an in x time adverbial.\nThis was different in English where the authors found coercion to\ncause a substantial slowdown of reading speed. They interpret this\ncrosslinguistic difference as follows: languages which have the\ngrammatical means to express an aspectual difference via alternative\nforms\u2014the progressive vs. simple forms in English\u2014enforce\nimmediate aspectual commitment, whereas languages that lack this\ngrammatical feature have to leave it underspecified. In other words,\nGerman readers will leave it to the context whether an accomplishment\nexpresses a complete or incomplete event, whereas English readers\nimmediately strengthen an accomplishment in the simple form into a\ncomplete event interpretation. They take this strengthening to be a\npragmatic process that is due to competition between alternative\ngrammatical forms.\nIn an eyetracking during reading study, Bott and Gattnar (2015)\nfollowed up on the observed cross-linguistic variation in the\nprocessing of grammatical aspect comparing an aspect language, Russian,\nwith the non-aspect language German. They investigated whether the\ndifferences in the aspectual systems of the two languages affected the\ntime course of mismatch detection in the case of lexical aspectual\nmismatch.All test sentences contained clear instances of (in Russian always perfective) transitive achievement verbs such as  win, find, reach, notice, etc. which were modified by a semantically mismatching for-adverbial (e.g., for three hours) or a semantically fitting ago-adverbial (e.g., three hours ago)\nin aspectual control conditions. Crucially, both Russian and German\nhave relatively free word order making it possible to test for effects\nof mismatching vs. matchingadverbials in the word order  subject verb object adverbial but also in the order adverbial verb subject object. The results show that Russian readers immediately detect the aspectual  mismatch\nirrespective of whether they have seen the subject or the object\nargument yet. This is different in German where aspectual mismatch\ndetection only started after the verb plus all its obligary arguments\nhad been encountered. This result was modeled by Bott and Sternefeld\n(2017) in an incremental event semantics drawing on insights from\nmereological semantics as proposed by Krifka (1989, 1992); see\n also\n section 6.1 (and the entry\n mereology).\nThe incremental semantic derivations show that in a non-aspect language\nlike German, lexical aspect really is a property of whole sentences and\nstrongly depends on the compositional interpretation of the verb, its\narguments, and their thematic roles. In an aspect language like\nRussian, on the other hand, the grammatical aspect imposes itself\nstrong constraints on lexical aspectual interpretation. These\npsycholinguistic results thus nicely fit semantic proposals for\ngrammatical aspect that have been proposed in the framework of\nmereological semantics (see, e.g., Filip 2008, a.o.).\n\nTo summarize, the existing studies lend empirical support to the\naspectual distinctions made in the semantic and philosophic\nliterature. Moreover, the grammatical system of a language influences\nthe way language is processed and may even influence the way we\nexperience the world. \n",
