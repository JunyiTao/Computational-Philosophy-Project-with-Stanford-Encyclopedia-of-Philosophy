    "main_text": "Implicatures and Game Theory || A game-theoretic explanation of Horn\u2019s division\n2.2 A game-theoretic explanation of Horn\u2019s division\n\nParikh (1988, 1991, 1992) proposed the use of game theory to account\nfor disambiguation and implicature. As it turns out, the same proposal\ncan be used to account for Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic labour\nas well. Parikh assumes that a message, or form, \\(f_u\\), is\nsemantically ambiguous, and can have a stereotypical interpretation,\n\\(t_{st}\\), and a non-stereotypical interpretation \\(t_{\\neg st}\\),\nwith \\(P(t_{st}) \\gt P(t_{\\neg st})\\). Both meanings, however, could\nbe expressed unambiguously as well by a more complex form.\nInterpretation \\(t_{\\neg st}\\), for instance, can be expressed not\nonly by \\(f_u\\), but by form \\(f_m\\) as well that literally expresses\nit. As is usual in so-called costly signalling games, and also\nconsistent with Parikh\u2019s proposal, the sender\u2019s utility\nfunction can be decomposed into a benefit and a cost function, \\(U_s\n(t,f,i) = B_s (t,i) - C(f)\\), where \\(i\\) is an interpretation. We\nadopt the following benefit function: \\(B_s (t,i) = 1\\) if \\(i = t\\),\nand \\(B_s (t,i) = 0\\) otherwise. The cost of the ambiguous message\n\\(f_u\\) is lower than the cost of the unambiguous message \\(f_m\\). We\ncan assume without loss of generality that \\(C(f_u) = 0 \\lt C(f_m)\\).\nIn the use of signalling games for the analysis of human communication\nit is standard to assume that it is always better to have successful\ncommunication with a costly message than unsuccessful communication\nwith a cheap message, which means that \\(C(f_m)\\), though greater than\n\\(C(f_u)\\), must remain reasonably small. If we limit ourselves to a\ngame with 2 states, \\(t_{st}\\) and \\(t_{\\neg st}\\), and three\nmessages, \\(f_u\\) and the two forms that literally express the two\nstates, and think of sender and receiver strategies as before, the\ncombination of sender and receiver strategies that gives rise to the\nbijective mapping \\(\\{\\langle t_{st},f_u\\rangle , \\langle t_{\\neg\nst},f_m\\rangle \\}\\) is a Nash equilibrium of this game. Intuitively,\nthis is also the correct solution of the disambiguation game, because\nthe ambiguous message \\(f_u\\) expresses the stereotypical\ninterpretation \\(t_{st}\\), while the non-stereotypical state \\(t_{\\neg\nst}\\) is expressed by the marked and costlier message \\(f_m\\).\nUnfortunately, also the mapping \\(\\{\\langle t_{st},f_m\\rangle ,\n\\langle t_{\\neg st},f_u\\rangle \\}\\)\u2014where the lighter message\ndenotes the non-stereotypical situation\u2014is a Nash equilibrium of\nthe game, which means that on the present implementation the standard\nsolution concept of game theory cannot yet single out the desired\noutcome.\n\nThis is were considerations of equilibrium refinements and/or\nalternative solution concepts come in. Parikh (1988, 1991, 1992)\nobserves that of the two equilibria mentioned above, the first one\nPareto-dominates the second\u2014being the unique Pareto-Nash\nequilibrium\u2014and that for this reason the former should be\npreferred. Van Rooij (2004) suggests that because Horn\u2019s\ndivision of pragmatic labor involves not only language use but also\nlanguage organization, one should look at signaling games from an\nevolutionary point of view, and make use of those variants of\nevolutionary game theory that explain the emergence of Pareto-optimal\nsolutions. As a third alternative, following some ideas of De Jaegher\n(2008), van Rooij (2008) proposes that one could also make use of\nforward induction (a particular game-theoretic way of reasoning about\nsurprising moves of the opponent) to single out the desired\nequilibrium. As an example of an approach that draws on detailed\nmodelling of the epistemic states of interlocutors, Franke (2014a)\nsuggests that we should distinguish cases of M-implicature that\ninvolve rather clear ad hoc reasoning, such as (5) and (6),\nfrom cases with a possibly more grammaticalized contrast, such as\nbetween (3) and (4).\n\nMrs T sang \u2018Home Sweet Home\u2019.\nMrs T produces a series of sounds roughly corresponding to the\nscore of \u2018Home Sweet Home\u2019.\n\n\nFranke suggests that the game model for reasoning about (5) and (6)\nshould contain an element of asymmetry of alternatives: whereas it is\nreasonable (for a speaker to expect that) a listener would consider\n(5) to be an alternative utterance when hearing (6), it is quite\nimplausible that (a speaker believes that) a listener will consider\n(6) a potential alternative utterance when hearing (5). This asymmetry\nof alternatives translates into different beliefs that the listener\nwill have about the context after different messages. The speaker can\nanticipate this, and a listener who has actually observed (6) can\nreason about his own counterfactual context representation that he\nwould have had if the speaker had said (5) instead. Franke shows that,\nwhen paired with this asymmetry in context representation, a simple\nmodel of iterated best response reasoning, to which we turn next,\ngives the desired result as well.\n2.3 Quantity implicatures and iterated reasoning\n\nUnlike the case of M-implicatures, many Quantity implicatures hinge on\nthe fact that alternative expressions differ with respect to logical\nstrength: the inference from \u2018three\u2019 to the pragmatically\nstrengthed \u2018exactly three\u2019-reading, that we sketched in\nSection 1.1, draws on the fact that the alternative expression\n\u2018four\u2019 is semantically stronger, i.e., \u2018four\u2019\nsemantically entails \u2018three\u2019, but not the other way\naround, under the assumed \u2018at least\u2019-semantics. In order\nto bring considerations of semantic strength to bear on game-theoretic\npragmatics, we must assign conventional meaning some role in either\nthe game model or the solution concept. In the following, we look at\ntwo similar, but distinct possibilities of treating semantic meaning\nin approaches that spell out pragmatic reasoning as chains of\n(higher-order) reasoning about interlocutors\u2019 rationality.\n\nA straightforward and efficient way of bringing semantic meaning into\ngame-theoretic pragmatics is to simply restrict the set of viable\nstrategies of sender and receiver in a signaling game to those\nstrategies that conform to conventional meaning: a sender can only\nselect forms that are true of the actual state, and the receiver can\nonly select interpretations which are in the denotation of an observed\nmessage. This may seem crude and excludes cases of non-literal\nlanguage use, lying, cheating and error from the start, but it may\nserve to rationalize common patterns of pragmatic reasoning among\ncooperative, information-seeking interlocutors. Based on such a\nrestriction to truth-obedient strategies, it has been shown\nindependently by Pavan (2013) and Rothschild (2013) that there is an\nestablished non-equilibrium solution concept that nicely rationalizes\nQuantity implicatures, namely iterated admissibility, also\nknown as iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies.\nWithout going into detail, the general idea of this solution concept\nis to start with the whole set of viable strategies (all conforming to\nsemantic meaning) and then to iteratively eliminate all strategies\n\\(X\\) for which there is no cautious belief about which of\nthe opponent\u2019s remaining strategies the opponent will likely\nplay that would make \\(X\\) a rational thing to do. (A cautious belief\nis one that does not exclude any opponent strategy that has not been\neliminated so far.) The set of strategies that survive repeated\niterations of elimination are then compatible with (a particular kind\nof) common belief in rationality. In sum, iterated admissibility is an\neliminative approach: starting from the set of all (truth-abiding)\nstrategies, some strategies are weeded out at every step until we\nremain with a stable set of strategies from which nothing can be\neliminated anymore.\n\nAn alternative to restricting attention to only truthful strategies is\nto use semantic meaning to constrain the starting point of pragmatic\nreasoning. Approaches that do so are the optimal assertions\napproach (Benz 2006, Benz & van Rooij 2007), iterated\nbest response models (e.g., Franke 2009, 2011, J\u00e4ger 2014),\nand related probabilistic models (e.g., Frank & Goodman\n2012, Goodman & Stuhlm\u00fcller 2013, Franke & J\u00e4ger\n2014). The general idea that unifies these approaches can be traced\ndirectly to Grice, in particular the notion that speakers should\nmaximize the amount of relevant information contained in their\nutterances. Since information contained in an utterance is standardly\ntaken to be semantic information (as opposed to pragmatically\nrestricted or modulated meaning), a simple way of implementing Gricean\nspeakers is to assume that they choose utterances by considering how a\nliteral interpreter would react to each alternative. Pragmatic\nlisteners then react optimally based on the belief that the speaker is\nGricean in the above sense. In other words, these approaches define a\nsequence of Theory-of-Mind reasoning: starting with a (non-rational,\ndummy) literal interpreter, a Gricean speaker acts (approximately)\nrationally based on literal interpretation, while a Gricean listener\ninterprets (approximately) rationally based on the behavior of a\nGricean speaker. Some contributions allow for further iterations of\nbest responses, others do not; some contributions also look at\nreasoning sequences that start with literal senders; some\ncontributions assume that agents are strictly rational, others allow\nfor probabilistic approximations to classical rational choice (see\nFranke & J\u00e4ger 2014 for overview and comparison).\n\nA crucial difference between iterated best response approaches and the\npreviously mentioned approach based on iterated admissibility is that\nthe former does not shrink a set of strategies but allows for a\ndifferent set of best responses at each step. This also makes it so\nthat (some) iterated best response approaches can deal with pragmatic\nreasoning in cases where interlocutors\u2019 preferences are not\naligned, i.e., where the Gricean assumption of cooperativity does not\nhold, or where there are additional incentives to deviate from\nsemantic meaning (for more about game models for reasoning in\nnon-cooperative contexts, see, e.g., Franke, de Jager & van Rooij\n2012, de Jaegher & van Rooij 2014, Franke & van Rooij 2015).\nAnother difference between iterated best response models and iterated\nadmissibility is that the latter do not by itself account for\nHorn\u2019s division of pragmatic labor (see Franke 2014b and Pavan\n2014 for discussion).\n\nTo illustrate how iterated best response reasoning works in a simple\n(cooperative) case, let us look briefly at numerical expressions\nagain. Take a signaling game with 4 states, or worlds, \\(W = \\{w_1,\nw_2, w_3, w_4\\}\\) where the indices give the exact/maximal number of\nchildren that came to our party, and four messages \\(F =\n\\{\\)\u2018one\u2019,\u2018two\u2019,\u2018three\u2019,\n\u2018four\u2019\\(\\}\\), as shorthand for \u2018\\(n\\) children came\nto our party\u2019. On a neo-Gricean \u2018at\nleast\u2019-interpretation of numerals, the meanings of the numeral\nexpressions form an implication chain: \n\n\\[ \\llbracket `\\text{four}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{three}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{two}\\rsquo \\rrbracket \\subset \\llbracket `\\text{one}\\rsquo \\rrbracket, \\]\n\n\nbecause, for instance, \\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket =\n\\{w_3, w_4\\}\\). A literal interpreter, who is otherwise oblivious to\ncontextual factors, would respond to every message by choosing any\ntrue interpretation with equal probability. So, for instance, if the\nliteral interpreter hears \u2018three\u2019, he would choose \\(w_3\\)\nor \\(w_4\\), each with probability \\(\u00bd\\). But that means that an\noptimal choice of expression for a speaker who wants to communicate\nthat the actual world is \\(w_3\\) would be \u2018three\u2019, because\nthis maximizes the chance that the literal interpreter selects\n\\(w_3\\). Concretely, if the speaker chooses \u2018one\u2019, the\nchance that the literal listener chooses \\(w_3\\) is \u00bc; for\n\u2018two\u2019 it\u2019s \u2153; for \u2018three\u2019\nit\u2019s \\(\u00bd\\), and for \u2018four\u2019 it\u2019s zero,\nbecause \\(w_3\\) is not an element of\n\\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket\\). So, a rational\nGricean speaker selects\n\\(\\llbracket\\)\u2018three\u2019\\(\\rrbracket\\) in \\(w_3\\) and nowhere\nelse, as is easy to see by a parallel argument for all other states.\nBut that means that a Gricean interpreter who hears\n\u2018three\u2019 will infer that the actual world must be\n\\(w_3\\).\n\nIn recent years, a few promising extensions of this pragmatic\nreasoning scheme have been proposed. One is to include probabilistic\nchoice functions to model agents\u2019 approximately rational\nchoices, so as to allow for a much more direct link with experimental\ndata (for overview see Franke & J\u00e4ger 2016, Goodman &\nFrank 2016). Such probabilistic pragmatic models have been applied to\na number of phenomena of interest, including reasoning about\nreferential expressions in context (Frank & Goodman 2012),\nignorance implicatures (Goodman & Stuhlm\u00fcller 2013), context\neffects on scalar implicatures (Degen et al. 2015), non-literal\ninterpretation of number terms (Kao et al. 2014), pragmatic meaning\nmodulation associated with particular intonation (Bergen & Goodman\n2015, Stevens 2016), and Quantity implicatures in complex sentences\n(Bergen et al. 2016, Potts et al. 2016). These models of pragmatic\nreasoning have furthermore been used successfully also in natural\nlanguage processing applications (Andreas & Klein 2016, Monroe et\nal. 2017) and other areas of linguistic research, such as\nsociolinguistics (Burnett 2019). Another recent approach is to allow\nfor uncertainty of the semantic meanings of the involved expressions,\nand for uncertainty of the beliefs and preferences of the participants\nof thee conversation and of other aspects of the \u2018common\nground\u2019 (e.g., Brochhagen 2017). Finally, in recent work more\npragmatic phenomena are accounted for than just generalised\nconversational implicatures, such as particular conversational\nimplicature, explicatures or free enrichment (e.g., Parikh 2010), the\nanalysis of presupposition (Qing et al. 2016), and politeness (e.g.\nClark 2012, Yoon et al. 2020).\n3. Conclusion\n\nBidirectional Optimality Theory and Game Theory are quite natural, and\nsimilar, frameworks to formalize Gricean ideas about interactive,\ngoal-oriented pragmatic reasoning in context. Recent developments turn\ntowards epistemic or evolutionary game theory or to probabilistic\nmodels for empirical data. Finally, we remark that formal techniques\nsimilar to what is explored here are applicable to a wider range of\nproblems in diverse areas, such as philosophy (e.g., Parikh 2019),\nlanguage evolution (e.g., Ahern and Clark 2014; Brochhagen, Franke, and\nRooij 2018; Carcassi 2020), as well as computational linguistics (e.g.\nVogel et al. 2014, Cohn-Gordon, Goodman, and Potts 2019).",
