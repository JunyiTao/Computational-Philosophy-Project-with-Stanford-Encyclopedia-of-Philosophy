Future Prospects\n\nArguably, discussions of reductionism in biology are becoming more\nrather than less philosophically interesting. This is a consequence of\nrecognizing the diverse conceptual landscape carved out over past\ndecades, one that is much larger than that conceived of when only\nNagelian theory reduction was in view. Biological science is now more\nspecialized than ever, but disciplinary proliferation brings with it\nissues relevant to any analysis of reduction: using the same terms\ndifferently, disparate methodologies, distinct explanatory norms, and\ndivergent interests in \u201clevels\u201d of biological organization\n(Brooks 2021, Potochnik 2021). It also includes an acknowledgment that\ncertain enduring biological topics like development still engender\ndifficult questions about reductionism and new fields of inquiry\nreinvigorate these discussions (e.g., synthetic biology\u2019s appeal\nto molecular components as Lego-like building blocks in the\n Registry of Standard Biological Parts).\n Philosophers need to recognize that a criterion of adequacy on\naccounts of reductionism in biology involves interpreting why\nscientists make pronouncements about the failure of reductionism in\ndifferent areas of life science (see, e.g., De Backer et al.\n 2010).[17]\n\nThere also is increasing contact between neuroscience and\npsychologically oriented investigations (Barwich 2020, Bechtel 2008,\nBoogerd et al. 2002, Craver 2007, Sullivan 2016, 2017, Tabb 2019). A\npotential prospect related to the contact between molecular\nneurobiology and psychology is the injection of epistemic\nconsiderations into philosophy of mind discussions (Godfrey-Smith\n2008). More attention to issues of representation, decomposition, and\ntemporality could alter the nature of these debates. At the same time,\na more explicit evaluation of metaphysical components\nimported from philosophy of mind into philosophy of biology is\nwarranted. Discussions of the status of downward causation and\nrealization in biological systems are relevant for a better\nunderstanding of the intersection between epistemological and\nmetaphysical components of reduction (Craver and Bechtel 2007, Green\n2021, Love 2012, Robinson 2005, Wilson and Craver 2007, Woodward\n2021). For example, an interest in the context sensitivity of\nrealization in philosophy of mind (Wilson 2004, ch. 6) invokes issues\npertaining to the context objection, individuation, temporality\n(especially causation versus constitution), and intrinsicality. These\nanalyses can then be imported into biological contexts to argue for or\nagainst particular aspects of reductionism (see, e.g., Wilson\n2005).\n\nMore work is needed in how to relate different kinds of hierarchies to\nquestions of reductionism. Biological hierarchies are diverse (Grene\n1987, Korn 2002, 2005) and subject to evolutionary change (Baedke\n2021, DiFrisco, 2021, T\u00ebmkin 2021), and some areas of biological\nresearch, such as paleontology and systematics (Valentine and May\n1996; see also Grantham 1999, 2004a, 2004b, 2007), have been ignored\nwhen reductionism comes into view. Paying attention to temporality\nencourages the exploration of functional or control hierarchies in\nmore detail (Love 2021, Salthe 1985, 1993, Wimsatt 2002). The\nlimitations of representing biological systems in terms of hierarchies\nshould be explored in more depth as well (Bechtel 2022, Brooks 2014,\nO\u2019Malley et al. 2014, Potochnik 2021, Potochnik and McGill\n2012).\n\nAll of these possibilities suggest more scrutiny of disciplinary\nheterogeneity in biological investigation relevant to reductionism.\nAlthough ecology has received some treatment (Dupr\u00e9 1993, ch.\n5, Mikkelson 2004), issues of decomposition and representation have\nnot yet received wide attention. Other topics connected to explanatory\nreduction and mechanisms in experimental research are cancer\n(Bertolaso 2013, 2016, Bizzarri et al. 2008, Green 2021, Moss 2002,\nPlutynski 2013, Soto and Sonnenschein 2005, 2006) and stem cells\n(Fagan 2013, Laplane 2016, Laplane and Solary 2019). Because of the\ndiversity of explanations found in these different disciplines, the\nnature of scientific explanation returns with a vengeance (Schaffner\n2006). Although only a few reductionists demand that explanation be\nstrictly nomological (Rosenberg 2006, Weber 2005), the subtle\ninterplay between explanation and reduction must be treated when\nranging over diverse biological subdisciplines. Additionally, as more\nattention is given to the diversity of investigative reasoning (or\n\u201cscientific practice\u201d) in and among these disciplinary\ncontexts, the interplay between different aspects of methodological\nand epistemic reduction will become more salient. To achieve an\nunderstanding of the intricacy and diversity of scientific practice,\nit has become more common for philosophers of science to interact or\ncollaborate with scientists from various fields (\u201cengaged\nphilosophy of science\u201d), where some of the engagement with\npracticing scientists and stakeholders affected by science and\ntechnology also aims at influencing the methodological approaches\nadopted in such research (Brister and Frodeman 2020, Kaiser and\nMeunier 2014, Plaisance and Elliott 2021, Tuana 2010, 2013).\n\nA final prospect concerns whether discussions of reduction in\ndifferent sciences will interact fruitfully. Although questions about\nreduction in philosophy of physics have largely diverged from those in\nphilosophy of biology, some connections have been drawn (Batterman\n2021, Green and Batterman 2017). For example, Sarkar has approached\nquantum mechanics using his account of reductionism that was forged in\na biological context (Jaeger and Sarkar 2003). A potential\nintersection between these discussions arises around the relations\nbetween parts and wholes or temporality, which have come under\nscrutiny from philosophers focused on the physical sciences\n(H\u00fcttemann 2004, Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011, Rueger 2000,\nRueger and McGivern 2010). Another area worthy of more attention is\nreductive explanation in chemistry, which has been ignored in large\npart by philosophers of biology (see, e.g., Bishop 2010, LePoidevin\n2005, Ramsey 1997, Scerri 1994, 2000).\n\nIn all these cases it seems clear that debates about reductionism in\nbiology have not reached a denouement but rather portend vigorous\nphilosophical discussion as the heterogeneity of issues related to its\nontological, epistemological, and methodological types are brought to\nbear on perennial biological topics. The task of philosophers focused\non reductionism in biology will be to analyze these promiscuities of\nreasoning and seek to develop different accounts of reduction that\ncapture what scientists actually do and contribute to more general\nperspectives on biological knowledge and scientific inquiry.\n",
