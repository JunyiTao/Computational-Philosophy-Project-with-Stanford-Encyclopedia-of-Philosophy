    "main_text": "Influence || On Grammatical Writers\n5.1 On Grammatical Writers\n\nWhether \u201cgrammar\u201d was properly speaking a subdiscipline of\nStoic philosophy is debated, but it is generally agreed that Stoic\nphilosophy of language heavily influenced the works of Ancient\nGrammarians. There had long been interest in the study of language,\nbut the Stoics, and Chrysippus chief among them, with their systematic\nstudy of language, are considered by many to have laid the foundations\nfor what became the independent discipline of technical grammar. The\nStoic influence can be traced in various works, and Stoic views\n(sometimes attributed to \u201cthe philosophers\u201d) are\nexplicitly discussed in Scholia, especially to Dionysius Thrax\u2019s\nArt of Grammar. More notably, a debt to the Stoics is\nacknowledged by Apollonius Dyscolus, a highly influential second\ncentury CE Greek grammarian, one of the earliest grammarians for whom\nwe have extant works. Stoic influences can similarly be found in\nPriscian, a Latin grammarian of the 6th century CE living in\nConstantinople, whose Institutiones Grammaticae, in part\nbased on Apollonius Dyscolus\u2019 work, provided much of the\nfoundation for medieval grammar. The extent and exact nature of this\nStoic influence on the grammatical tradition has, however, been the\nsubject of considerable debate. On the interactions of grammar and\nphilosophy, see Lallot 1988, Sluiter 1990, Ildefonse 1997, Swiggers\nand Wouters 2002, Atherton and Blank 2013; on the Stoics specifically,\nsee Frede 1977, Atherton and Blank 2003; on Apollonius Dyscolus, Blank\n1982, 2000; and on Latin grammar and Priscian, Baratin 1989, Luhtala\n2005, Baratin et al. 2009, Ebbesen 2009.\n",
