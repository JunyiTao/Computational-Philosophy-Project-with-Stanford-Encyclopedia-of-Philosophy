    "main_text": "Mystery\n10. Mystery\n\nThe last few sections outlined a variety of approaches to theodicy\nwhich are compatible with theological determinism; they represent\nattempts to explain why God might allow evil which do not rely on the\ntraditional free will defense. Equally prominent in the\ntradition\u2019s treatment of evil, however, is the theme of mystery:\nan unwillingness to identify with any surety why God would allow evil.\nThat theme is prominent in scriptural treatments of evil, such as\nthose found in Job and Ecclesiastes. Perhaps the most plausible way to\ninterpret the tradition\u2019s emphasis on mystery is as a\ncombination of what philosophers now call skeptical theism and the\nMoore Switch.\n\nSkeptical theism\n notes that the basis of the argument from evil is often, perhaps\nalways, an inference from what is not seen, a \u201cnoseeum\u201d\ninference: \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason God could have for\nallowing evil, so there isn\u2019t one.\u201d Sometimes inferences\nof that sort are good ones, as when I infer that there are no\nelephants in the classroom on the basis of the fact that I don\u2019t\nsee any. But often inferences of that sort are fallacious, as when I\ninfer that there are no germs in the room on the basis of the fact\nthat I don\u2019t see any. The difference seems to be, roughly\nspeaking, that I would expect to see any elephants if there were any,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t expect to see the germs. Which are God\u2019s\nreasons most like, the elephants or the germs? Arguably, given the\nepistemic distance between God and man, his reasons would be more like\nthe germs, and so the fact that we can\u2019t identify a reason for\nGod to allow evil doesn\u2019t justify the inference that there is no\nsuch reason. Such, in outline, is the basic idea behind skeptical\ntheism. (See Dougherty and McBrayer 2014 for debate over the\nview.)\n\nThe Moore Switch (Rowe 1979) is a related but different move. If one\ncan know that God exists, and perhaps that Christianity or some other\nreligion is true, on the basis of other evidence, and that evidence is\nsufficiently great so as to overwhelm the evidence against the\nexistence of God provided by the existence of evil, then the problem\nof evil might become simply a puzzle to solve instead of a decisive\nreason against belief in God, even without a full explanation for\nevil. Particularly, if there exists a sort of direct perception of God\nor God\u2019s works or properties of created things that directly\nimply the existence of God, then the evidence provided by such direct\nperception could overwhelm the evidence for the premises of an\nargument from evil against theism. The movement of Reformed\nepistemology has claimed to identify such direct perceptions or\nsomething analogous to such direct perceptions, and as such\nconstitutes a distinct response to the problem of evil that still\namounts to a kind of appeal to, or justification of, mystery with\nrespect to God\u2019s reasons for allowing evil (See Alston 1991 and\nPlantinga 2000).\n11.Conclusion\n\nThe hallmark of the traditional free will defense is its\nfastidiousness: it seeks to distance God from as much evil as\npossible, so that his goodness will not be tainted by it. The God of\nthe Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions is not so fastidious. He is\nactive in all our deeds, turning our hearts where he wills\n(Prov. 21:1), and working in us to will and to do as he\npleases. Part of his purpose in this, the tradition holds, is that we\nbe creatures with the moral authenticity that can only come with free\nwill. The inevitable accompaniment, however, is that we sin. God does\nnot will this for its own sake, but if God\u2019s providence is\ncomplete he does will for us the independence that amounts to our\nrebellion, for it is indispensable to his purpose. The question the\ntradition faces is whether God\u2019s providence can be complete\nhere, whether he can have full sovereignty if we are truly free. The\nsecond focus of concern is the fact of suffering, which also falls\nunder God\u2019s will. According to theodicies that emphasize\nsoul-making and defeasibility, this is not because God is malevolent,\nbut so that we can share with him the knowledge that evil is\ncreation\u2019s enemy, and partake in the glory of its defeat. The\nscriptural God evinces no fear that he will be tainted by any of this,\nnor does he distance himself from evil in any way. On the contrary:\neven after Adam\u2019s sin God remains fully engaged with humankind,\nsparing no effort to secure our rescue, and treating our suffering\nwith healing concern and compassion. In the Christian tradition, he is\neven willing to send his son to bear our sorrows with us, and to be\nsacrificed so that we may again find acceptance with God in\nrepentance. The fallenness of creation is not, then, an object of\nheavenly disdain, and for defenders of divine providence it is not\ncause for philosophical disappointment. Rather, they hold, the task of\novercoming evil is central to the creative enterprise. We sin and\nsuffer because God is out to defeat sin and suffering, and to see that\nall who are ordained to share in the victory do so. The theist is\nforced to admit, however, that we do not always understand in detail\nhow this occurs, and some sort of appeal to mystery may in fact be\nnecessary. In that respect, at least, any theodicy has to be\nincomplete.",
