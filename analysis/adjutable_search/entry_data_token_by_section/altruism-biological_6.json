Conceivably,\nan animal might engage in a social behaviour which benefits another\nand reduces its own (absolute) fitness in the short-term; however, in\nthe long-term, the behaviour might be to the animal's advantage. So if\nwe focus on short-term fitness effects, the behaviour will seem\naltruistic; but if we focus on lifetime fitness, the behaviour will\nseem selfish\u2014the animal's lifetime fitness would be reduced if it\ndid not perform the behaviour.\n\n\nWhy might a social behaviour reduce an animal's short-term fitness but\nboost its lifetime fitness? This could arise in cases of \u2018directed\nreciprocation\u2019, where the beneficiary of the behaviour returns the\nfavour at some point in the future (cf. Sachs et al. 2004). By\nperforming the behaviour, and suffering the short-term cost, the\nanimal thus ensures (or raises the chance) that it will receive return\nbenefits in the future. Similarly, in symbioses between members of\ndifferent species, it may pay an organism to sacrifice resources for\nthe benefit of a symbiont with which it has a long-term relationship,\nas its long-term welfare may be heavily dependent on the symbiont's\nwelfare.  \n\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the most satisfactory resolution of\nthis ambiguity is to use lifetime fitness as the relevant parameter\n(cf. West et al. 2007) Thus an action only counts as\naltruistic if it reduces an organism's lifetime fitness. This\nstipulation makes sense, since it preserves the key idea that the\nevolution of altruism requires statistical association between donor\nand recipient; this would not be true if short-term fitness were used\nto define altruism, for behaviours which reduce short-term fitness but\nboost lifetime fitness can evolve with no component of kin selection,\nor donor-recipient correlation. However, the stipulation has two\ndisadvantages: (i) it makes it harder to tell whether a given\nbehaviour is altruistic, since lifetime fitness is notoriously\ndifficult to estimate; (ii) it has the consequence that most models of\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019 are mis-named.\n",
