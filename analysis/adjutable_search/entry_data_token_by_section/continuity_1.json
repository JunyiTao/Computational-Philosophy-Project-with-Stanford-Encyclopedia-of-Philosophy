    "main_text": "The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Ancient Period\n2. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Ancient Period\n\nThe opposition between Continuity and Discreteness played a\nsignificant role in ancient Greek philosophy. This probably derived\nfrom the still more fundamental question concerning the One and the\nMany, an antithesis lying at the heart of early Greek thought (Stokes\n1971). The Greek debate over the continuous and the discrete seems to\nhave been ignited by the efforts of Eleatic philosophers such as\nParmenides (c. 515 BCE), and Zeno (c. 460 BCE) to establish their\ndoctrine of absolute\n monism.[6]\n They were concerned to show that the divisibility of Being into parts\nleads to contradiction, so forcing the conclusion that the apparently\ndiverse world is a static, changeless\n unity.[7]\n In his Way of Truth Parmenides asserts that Being is\nhomogeneous and continuous. However in asserting the\ncontinuity of Being Parmenides is likely no more than underscoring its\nessential unity. Parmenides seems to be claiming that Being is more\nthan merely continuous\u2014that it is, in fact, a single whole,\nindeed an indivisible whole. The single Parmenidean existent\nis a continuum without parts, at once a continuum and an atom. If\nParmenides was a synechist, his absolute monism precluded his being at\nthe same time a divisionist.\n\nIn support of Parmenides\u2019 doctrine of changelessness Zeno\nformulated his famous paradoxes of motion. (see entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes)\n The Dichotomy and Achilles paradoxes both rest\nexplicitly on the limitless divisibility of space and time.\n\nThe doctrine of\n Atomism,[8]\n which seems to have arisen as an attempt at escaping the Eleatic\ndilemma, was first and foremost a physical theory. It was mounted by\nLeucippus (fl. 440 BCE) and Democritus (b. 460\u2013457 BCE) who\nmaintained that matter was not divisible without limit, but composed\nof indivisible, solid, homogeneous, spatially extended corpuscles, all\nbelow the level of visibility.\n\nAtomism was challenged by Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), who was the\nfirst to undertake the systematic analysis of continuity and\ndiscreteness. A thoroughgoing synechist, he maintained that physical\nreality is a continuous plenum, and that the structure of a continuum,\ncommon to space, time and motion, is not reducible to anything else.\nHis answer to the Eleatic problem was that continuous magnitudes are\npotentially divisible to infinity, in the sense that they may be\ndivided anywhere, though they cannot be divided\neverywhere at the same time.\n\nAristotle identifies continuity and discreteness as attributes\napplying to the category of\n Quantity.[9]\n As examples of continuous quantities, or continua, he offers\nlines, planes, solids (i.e., solid bodies), extensions, movement, time\nand space; among discrete quantities he includes\n number[10]\n and\n speech.[11]\n He also lays down definitions of a number of terms, including\ncontinuity. In effect, Aristotle defines continuity as a\nrelation between entities rather than as an\nattribute appertaining to a single entity; that is to say, he\ndoes not provide an explicit definition of the concept of\ncontinuum. He observes that a single continuous whole can be\nbrought into existence by \u201cgluing together\u201d two things\nwhich have been brought into contact, which suggests that the\ncontinuity of a whole should derive from the way its parts\njoin up (see Physics V, 3).  Accordingly for Aristotle\nquantities such as lines and planes, space and time are continuous by\nvirtue of the fact that their constituent parts \u201cjoin together\nat some common boundary\u201d (Catergories, VI [MOMM]).  By\ncontrast no constituent parts of a discrete quantity can\npossess a common boundary.\n\nOne of the central theses Aristotle is at pains to defend is the\nirreducibility of the continuum to discreteness\u2014that a continuum\ncannot be \u201ccomposed\u201d of indivisibles or atoms, parts which\ncannot themselves be further divided.\n\nAristotle sometimes recognizes infinite\ndivisibility\u2014the property of being divisible into parts\nwhich can themselves be further divided, the process never terminating\nin an indivisible\u2014as a consequence of continuity as he\ncharacterizes the notion. But on occasion he takes the property of\ninfinite divisibility as defining continuity. It is this\ndefinition of continuity that figures in Aristotle\u2019s\ndemonstration of what has come to be known as the isomorphism\nthesis, which asserts that either magnitude, time and motion are\nall continuous, or they are all discrete.\n\nThe question of whether magnitude is perpetually divisible into\nsmaller units, or divisible only down to some atomic magnitude leads\nto the dilemma of divisibility (Miller 1982), a difficulty\nthat Aristotle necessarily had to face in connection with his analysis\nof the continuum. In the dilemma\u2019s first, or nihilistic\nhorn, it is argued that, were magnitude everywhere divisible, the\nprocess of carrying out this division completely would reduce a\nmagnitude to extensionless points, or perhaps even to nothingness. The\nsecond, or atomistic, horn starts from the assumption that\nmagnitude is not everywhere divisible and leads to the equally\nunpalatable conclusion (for Aristotle, at least) that indivisible\nmagnitudes must exist.\n\nAs a thoroughgoing materialist,\n Epicurus[12]\n (341\u2013271 BCE) could not accept the notion of potentiality on\nwhich Aristotle\u2019s theory of continuity rested, and so was\npropelled towards atomism in both its conceptual and physical senses.\nLike Leucippus and Democritus, Epicurus felt it necessary to postulate\nthe existence of physical atoms, but to avoid Aristotle\u2019s\nstrictures he proposed that these should not be themselves\nconceptually indivisible, but should contain conceptually\nindivisible parts. Aristotle had shown that a continuous magnitude\ncould not be composed of points, that is, indivisible units\nlacking extension, but he had not shown that an indivisible unit must\nnecessarily lack extension. Epicurus met Aristotle\u2019s argument\nthat a continuum could not be composed of such indivisibles by taking\nindivisibles to be partless units of magnitude possessing\nextension.\n\nIn opposition to the atomists, the Stoic philosophers Zeno of Cition\n(fl. 250 BCE) and Chrysippus (280\u2013206 BCE) upheld the\nAristotelian position that space, time, matter and motion are all\ncontinuous (Sambursky 1954 [1956], 1959; White 1992). And, like\nAristotle, they explicitly rejected any possible existence of void\nwithin the cosmos. The cosmos is pervaded by a continuous invisible\nsubstance which they called pneuma (Greek:\n\u201cbreath\u201d). This pneuma\u2014which was regarded as a kind\nof synthesis of air and fire, two of the four basic elements, the\nothers being earth and water\u2014was conceived as being an elastic\nmedium through which impulses are transmitted by wave motion. All\nphysical occurrences were viewed as being linked through tensile\nforces in the pneuma, and matter itself was held to derive its\nqualities from the \u201cbinding\u201d properties of the pneuma it\ncontains.\n",
