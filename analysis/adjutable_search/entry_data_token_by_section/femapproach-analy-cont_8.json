    "main_text": "Epistemic Injustice || The Continental Tradition\n3.2 The Continental Tradition\n\nFeminists in the Continental tradition are also interested in\nFricker\u2019s work. Warnke (2014) as well as Cynthia Nielsen and\nDavid Utsler (2023) note its affinities with Gadamer\u2019s\nhermeneutics, although they note that unlike Gadamer, Fricker supposes\nthe possibility of neutralizing one\u2019s identity prejudices where\nidentity is not relevant. For Gadamer, because prejudices are\nineradicable as anticipatory orientations, we cannot neutralize them.\nWe can, however, reveal them to ourselves \u2013 and thereby question\nthem \u2013 by always according an initial credibility to our\ninterlocutors, not, as Fricker supposes, only when we have reason to\nsuspect identity prejudice. \n\nOther feminists in the Continental tradition are concerned with\nFricker\u2019s reliance on virtue ethics and they stress the need to\ngo beyond the dyadic instances of epistemic injustice on which she\nfocuses. Axel Honneth (2023) argues for the necessity of embedding\nquestions of epistemic injustice in normative social theory and, in\nparticular, in a theory of social struggles for recognition. Alcoff\n(2017) makes three recommendations. First, we can look at what\nJos\u00e9 Medina calls \u201ccomplex histories and chains of social\ninteractions that go beyond particular pairs and clusters of\nsubjects\u201d (Medina 2013, 60). Second, we can look at\nFoucault\u2019s account of power/knowledge regimes for a robust\naccount of collective hermeneutical resources and the exclusions they\nenforce as well of the institutional mechanisms that determine what is\nand is not to count as knowledge and who is and who is not to count as\na knower. Finally, we can look at Foucault\u2019s development of\ngenealogy as a form of critique that allows for the disruption of\nepistemic hierarchies that may be inherited but that are nonetheless\ncontingent.\n\nIn addition to Gadamer and Foucault, feminists in the Continental\ntradition look to the Marxist tradition and, in particular, to the\nwork of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. What Fricker conceives of as structural\nprejudice in the collective hermeneutical resources, they see as the\nsort of ideological obfuscation that undermines a society\u2019s\ncapacity to understand its own creations. Thus, Habermas points to the\npower-relations our hermeneutical resources include and asks us not to\nforget that \u201cthe background consensus of established traditions\n\u2026 can be a consciousness forged of compulsions.\u201d (1977,\n358\u20139). (Also see Mills 2017.) Habermas\u2019s early work\nfocused on psychoanalysis as a model for a critical social theory but\nhe later turns to a reconstructive science of communicative competence\nand to the possibilities of deliberative forms of democracy.\nDeliberative democratic theory looks to non-coercive exchanges of\narguments among free and equal citizens who justify their claims and\nproposals by appealing to considerations that can be accepted by all\nthose affected (1998, 458). Accordingly, Benhabib (1996) maintains\nthat only those norms are valid that are agreed to in deliberations\nthat have the following features:\n\n1) participation in such deliberation is governed by norms of equality\nand symmetry; all have the same chances to initiate speech acts, to\nquestion, to interrogate, and to open debate; 2) all have the right to\nquestion the assigned topics of conversation; and 3) all have the\nright to initiate reflexive arguments about the very rules of the\ndiscourse procedure and the way in which they are applied or carried\nout (70).\n\n\nOther feminists have sought an expanded version of deliberative theory\nthat recognizes impediments to the participation of women and other\nmarginalized groups. Fraser insists that critical theory needs to\n\u201crender visible the ways in which societal inequality infects formally\ninclusive public spheres and taints discursive interaction within\nthem\u201d (1992, 121). She thus calls for a principle of participatory\nparity where all members of a society participate as peers. Social\npolicies and actions must thus acknowledge the legitimacy of claims to\nrecognition, achieve fairness in distributing resources and assure\npolitical representation (2005). For her part, Young (1996) questions\nthe exclusionary function of rational argumentation. She thus\nsubstitutes communicative for deliberative democracy in order to\nexpand the scope of considerations beyond the exchange of reasons to\ninclude story-telling as well as argumentation on grounds close to\nFricker\u2019s and Dotson\u2019s concerns: namely that power\nrelations can stifle speech (1996). Likewise Simone Chambers looks to\na melding of deliberative and diversity theory (2003) while Noelle\nMcAfee (2008) looks beyond a Habermasian proceduralism to an\nintegrative model of public deliberation that respects the importance\nof multiple, partial views.\n",
