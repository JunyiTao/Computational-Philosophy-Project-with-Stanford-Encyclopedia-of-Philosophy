    "main_text": "Early Theories of Consequence || 13th Century\n2.3 13th Century\n\nThe two main features of 13th century logic are arguably\nthe emergence of the terminist tradition (authors such as Peter of\nSpain, William of Sherwood and Lambert of Auxerre/Lagny) and the\nabsorption of the newly rediscovered Aristotelian texts and other\nGreek sources, resulting in an extensive commentary tradition (Uckelman and Lagerlund 2016) The latter resulted in the distinction between three\ngroups of logical theories: what became known as the logica\nvetus (topics emerging from the traditional texts which had\nremained available throughout: the Categories, On\nInterpretation, Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge); the logica\nnova (covering the material from the newly discovered\nAristotelian texts); and the logica modernorum (topics not\ndirectly related to the Aristotelian corpus, such as consequence,\ninsolubles and obligations).\n\nThe terminist authors did not address consequence as an autonomous\ntopic of investigation; their views on the matter are scattered along\ntheir analyses of sentences, the Topics, fallacies and\nsyncategoremata (the syncategorema \u2018si\u2019 in\nparticular) (Spruyt 2018). For 13th century authors, the two main types of consequence were natural and accidental consequences (Martin 2018); another frequently drawn distinction was that between simple and as-of-now consequences (Archambault 2018a). But one cannot really speak of full-fledged theories of consequence among the terminist authors, at least not if compared with what was to come in the 14th century.\n\nOverall, 13th century authors viewed the semantics of conditionals and the relation of consequence predominantly through metaphysical lenses; the main line of thought was that the antecedent had to be somehow causally related to the consequent (Spruyt 2018). These metaphysical relations continued to be conceptualized in terms of the framework from the Topics, as they had been by Boethius. Given this metaphysical focus, 13th century authors typically did not recognize (TP) as a sufficient criterion for a relation of consequence to hold; some stronger connection between antecedent and consequent was required, often conceptualized in terms of containment (Co).\n\nAlso significant for the overall development of the concept of\nconsequence is the increasing presence of Aristotelian hylomorphism in\nlogical contexts. While hylomorphism had not been entirely unknown to\nLatin authors prior to the rediscovery of the remaining Aristotelian\ntexts in the late 12th and 13th centuries, in\nthis period an explosion of applications of Aristotelian metaphysical\nconcepts in other areas occurred, especially in logic (Spruyt 2003).\nIn particular, applications of the form-matter distinction to\narguments (specifically, syllogisms) became frequent again, after a\nhiatus of many centuries since the ancient commentators. Such\napplications can be found in the only known 12th-century\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics, the Anonymus\nAurelianensis III (Ebbesen 1981), in the Dialectica\nMonacensis (an anonymous text of the early 13th\ncentury, edited in De Rijk 1962/7), and in Robert Kilwardby\u2019s\ncommentary on the Prior Analytics (1230s \u2014 see (Thom 2007) (Thom 2019)),\namong other texts. The significance of these applications is that they\npaved the way for the consolidation of the notion of formal\nconsequence in the 14th century (Dutilh Novaes 2012b),\nwhich in turn was to have a huge impact on the rest of the history of\nlogic.\n\nIndeed, one of the earliest known uses of the phrase \u2018formal\nconsequence\u2019 can be found in Simon of Faversham\u2019s questions on\nthe Sophistical Refutations, written in the 1280s:\n\nWhen it is said that \u201can animal is a substance; therefore a man\nis a substance\u201d is a good consequence I reply that this\nconsequence does not hold in virtue of form (ratione formae),\nbut rather in virtue of matter. Because according to the Commentator\n[Averroes] on the first book of the Physics, an argument\nwhich is valid (concludens) in virtue of form must hold in\nall matter. This consequence, however, holds only for features which\nare essential [\u2026] and so this consequence is not formal\n(formalis). (Simon of Faversham, Quaestiones Super Libro\nElenchorum, quaestio 36, 200; translation from (Martin 2005)\n135.)\n\n\nIt is significant that Simon refers to Averroes\u2019 commentary on the\nPhysics, thus illustrating the importation of the\nAristotelian (meta)physical framework into logical analyses. We here\nhave the notion of \u2018valid in virtue of form\u2019 (as with\nAbelard\u2019s \u2018complexio\u2019), and the association of\nform and formality with the idea of substitution of terms (ST). Other\nauthors of the same period, John Duns Scotus for example, also use the\nphrase \u2018consequentia formalis\u2019 and its variants,\nbut not in the substitutional sense of holding \u2018in all\nmatter\u2019 (Martin 2005).\n\nThis is the historical background for the consolidation of the\ndistinction between formal and material consequences in the\n14th century: a progression towards general theories of\nconsequence rather than exclusive focus on syllogisms, and the\nincreasing application of hylomorphism to arguments \u2014 at first\nto syllogisms, and later to arguments and consequences in general.\n",
