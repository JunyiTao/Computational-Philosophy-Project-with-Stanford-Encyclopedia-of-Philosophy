Anthropological and ethical dimensions of developmental evolution\n\nThe above debates about the relationship between evolution and\ndevelopment primarily emerged within philosophy of science, especially\nin history and philosophy of biology. However, there are other, more\ngeneral debates about anthropological and ethical issues that concern\ndevelopmental evolution. The primarily refer to how we conceptualize\ndeveloping and evolving humans, their life, body and health, as well\nas how we assign responsibilities for health care interventions.\n\nFirst, new findings in the plasticity of developing organism, their\ninterconnectedness, and modes of transgenerational transmission of\ninformation have affected scientific and public understandings of what\nhumans are. For example, if humans are conceptualized as holobionts\n\u2013 as collectives of co-developing and co-evolving organisms\n\u2013 this also means that development is a matter of\nco-construction, of interactions between species. It means, as Haraway\n(2016) has phrased it, that we \u2013 as humans \u2013 very\nliterally \u2018become with others.\u2019 In this context,\nsympoiesis (developmental symbiosis) means that development is\nco-development. Against this background, John Dupr\u00e9 and Maureen\nO'Malley (2009) see living entities as interactive collections:\n\u201cLife, we claim, is typically found at the collaborative\nintersections of many lineages, and we even suggest that collaboration\nshould be seen as a central characteristic of living\nmatter\u201d.\n\nSecond, biological and biophilosophical debates on developmental\nevolution and organisms\u2019 plasticity and environmental\nresponsiveness have informed debates on what the human body is. For\nexample, J\u00f6rg Niew\u00f6hner (2011) states that a new concept of\nthe human body is currently emerging in modern biology, the so-called\n\u2018embedded body\u2019. According to this view, the human body is\nno longer a machine-like unit, which is genetically programmed,\nneurally controlled and bounded by the skin, but an open and dynamic\nunit which cannot be grasped in isolation from its material and social\nenvironment (see also Baedke 2017). Additionally, the body is embedded\ninto different time scales ranging from its evolutionary and\ntransgenerational to ontogenetic past, which permanently constitute\nits present. Others have argued, against the standard human birth\nnarrative and Aristotle, who defined the temporal boundaries of\nindividuals at birth and death, that birth in humans is not the\ncreation of a new individual. Instead, birth should be understood as\nthe origin of a new multi-species collective (Gilbert 2014; Chiu &\nGilbert 2015).\n\nAnother anthropological issue arising from recent research in evo-devo\nand epigenetics is, third, the question how to define normality and\nhealth in humans (see Baedke 2019b). There is evidence that bacteria\nare needed for our normal cognitive and social development. For\nexample, germ-free mice are asocial and have autistic-like behavior\n(Desbonnet et al. 2014) and this behavior can be replicated by\nimplanting the microbiome from autistic patients (but not control\npatients) into germ-free mice (Sharon et al. 2019). Such cases suggest\nthat biological normality is not as intrinsic property to organisms\nbut emerges through interconnections with other organisms and the\nenvironment. In addition, our understanding of health is increasingly\nchallenged. This especially refers to the view that describes human\nhealth as freedom and autonomy from external interference. It usually\nsees bacteria as deviations from the norm and parasitism as\npathological, because it threatens and contaminates the purity of the\nindividual\u2019s energy pattern. Instead, in a (more processual)\nholobiontic framework, microbes are needed for normal development and\nare thought to prevent the development of certain diseases (Bello et\nal. 2018; Kirjavainen et al. 2019). In addition, certain entities,\nbacteria or viruses, previously thought to be harmful, are now\nincreasingly considered to be \u2018good\u2019 or\n\u2018healthy\u2019 collaborators, not \u2018bad intruders\u2019\n(Dupr\u00e9 & Guttinger 2016). In more general term, this means\nthat since microbiota are increasingly recognized as important\ncomponents that stabilize normal development and co-evolve with\nhumans, they therefore carry traits crucial for humans\u2019 fitness,\ni.e., health. This new perspective could lead to radical changes in\npersonalized surveillance and treatment of disease, and, more\ngenerally, to new strategies in policy making, which replace the idea\nof preserving the autonomous individual from contamination by the idea\nof maintaining (equilibrium states of) collectives of co-developing\nand co-evolving individuals.\n\nFinally, on a more ethical dimension, these findings about\nhumans\u2019 openness to their environments and to one another has\nled, first, to discussions about who takes responsibilities for\nhumans\u2019 health states and interventions (e.g., on epigenomes and\nmicrobiomes) on intra- and transgenerational timescales (Dupras &\nRavitsky 2016). If plastic development can shape evolution, who is\nresponsible for developmental outcomes and evolutionary trajectories\nin humans? Should the individual being as the central heath care\nagent, which is \u2018freed from the chains of its genes\u2019\n(Pickersgill et al. 2013), take this responsibility? Or should\ncollectives, such as national states or international bodies, be\nresponsible for levels of toxins in the environment as well as for the\nfood individuals eat and stress they are exposed to (Hedlund 2012)?\nThe latter account of responsibility aims to prevent overemphasizing\nthe causal role of mothers as the most central public health care\nagents who should be held accountable (and guilty) if their children\nor later generations become sick (Richardson et al. 2014).\n",
