    "main_text": "Formulating Dignity\n2. Formulating Dignity\n\nThere is no single, incontestable meaning of dignity. In fact, there\nare so many possible meanings that it has become commonplace in the\nliterature to worry about the expansive variety of conceptions, and in\nturn to worry whether dignity is or has become essentially ambiguous.\nAnd while its defenders find ways to mitigate or explain away this\nambiguity, the concept of dignity has its share of detractors. But we\nwill return to skeptical worries at the end of this entry. For now,\nand granting the prima facie force of the ambiguity worry,\nfour broad categories of meaning stand out across context and\nhistory:\n\nDignity as Gravitas: a poise or grace\nassociated with behavioral comportment; e.g., the sophisticated\nmanners or elegant speech of nobility, or outward composure in the\nface of insult or duress.\nDignity as Integrity: the family of ideas\nassociated with living up to personal or social standards of character\nand conduct, either in one\u2019s own eyes or the eyes of\nothers.\nDignity as Status: noble or elevated social\nposition or rank.\nDignity as Human dignity: the unearned worth or\nstatus that all humans share equally (either inherent or\nconstructed).\n\n\nThis \u201cgeneral schema\u201d is rough and ready. Scholars divide\nthe conceptual space in different ways, often advocating intersections\nbetween the foregoing four categories, making elaborations on them, or\nnoting wrinkles within them.\n\nFor example, Kolnai (1976) argues that the primary function of the\nconcept is descriptive, not evaluative. Dignity is a quality of\npersons, which is the fitting object of a set of pro-attitudes related\nto both moral appreciation and aesthetic appreciation. Thus,\nto be dignified is to comport oneself in a way that is not simply a\nreflection of authority, rank, moral uprightness, or a regimented or\nserious adherence to codes of conduct, but instead reflects something\nof \u201cthe beautiful\u201d. As Kolnai puts it, our response to\ndignity is characterized, at least in part, by \u201cour devoted and\nadmiring appreciation for beauty\u201d (1976: 252). Hence the\ndistinction between\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above (see also Brady 2007).\n\nBy contrast, although Rosen (2012a) notes that the Latin term\ndignitas was once part of a critical vocabulary of classical\nart and rhetoric, used \u201cto characterize speech that was weighty\nand majestic, in contrast to discourse that was light and\ncharming\u201d (2012a: 13), Rosen largely blends categories\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n into a single strand of meaning, which he identifies as\n\u201cdignity as behavior, character or bearing that is\ndignified\u201d (2012a: 54). Rosen then accepts\n (3)\n and\n (4)\n but adds his own further category, which he calls \u201cdignity as\ntreatment\u201d: \u201cTo treat someone with dignity\nis\u2026to respect their dignity\u201d (2012a: 58). As we\nwill see more fully in a moment, this addition reflects a common\nobservation by scholars about a tight connection between dignity and\nits recognition (although, it is not common to claim that the proper\nrecognition of dignity is a separate category of dignity).\n\nMeanwhile, Kateb (2011) stresses the need to distinguish between human\ndignity qua individual humans, and human dignity qua\nhuman species. According to Kateb, both have dignity. But whereas the\ndignity of individuals can be described as a special kind of\n\u201cstatus\u201d\u2014as in category\n (4)\n above\u2014the dignity of the human species requires a further\nconcept, namely, of \u201cstature\u201d. He writes, \u201cIn\ncomparison to other species, humanity has a stature beyond\ncomparison\u201d (2011: 6). To be clear, Kateb does not think that\nthe human species has an existence above and beyond its members: it is\nnot a natural kind. However, he argues that the interdependence of\nhumans is,\n\n\nso extensive, so deep, and so entangled\u2026that for certain\npurposes we might just as well make the human species a unified entity\nor agency, even though we know it isn\u2019t. (2011: 6)\n\n\nCorrespondingly, we can sensibly talk about the \u201cdignity\u201d\nof the species. This conclusion cuts against some positions that\nmaintain dignity \u201cproper\u201d can only belong to individuals\n(Stern 1975; Gaylin 1984; Egonsson 1998).\n\nA more recent schema is offered by Killmister (2020). Killmister\nproposes three \u201cstrands\u201d of dignity: personal, social, and\nstatus. To have personal dignity, Killmister argues, is to take\noneself to be subject to personal \u201cdignitarian\u201d norms. And\nto have social dignity is to be subject to social\n\u201cdignitarian\u201d norms. What are dignitarian norms?\nDignitarian norms are norms that either the person themself, or\nsociety at large, take to be \u201cennobling\u201d to uphold, or\nwhose transgression the person or society consider to be\n\u201cdisgraceful or debasing\u201d (2020: 25, 29). Like Rosen,\nthen, Killmister effectively blends categories\n (1)\n and\n (2),\n while at the same time drawing attention to a different\norganizational distinction one might make, namely, between the\npersonal and the social. As for \u201cstatus dignity\u201d,\nKillmister argues that explaining this category of dignity requires a\ndistinctive concept of respect. And her argument is worth elaborating\nbecause it exemplifies and fleshes out two closely related points\nshared by many existing theories:\n\nthat any satisfactory theory of dignity must explain what it means\nto recognize dignity; and\nthat this recognition is best described as a kind of\nrespect.\n\n\nSo, consider: Dignitarian norms, according to Killmister, can\ntypically be redescribed as articulating the grounds of\nrespect\u2014either self-respect (in the case of personal dignity) or\nrespect from others (in the case of social dignity). Moreover, the\nkind of respect relevant to personal and social dignity, she argues,\nis what Stephen Darwall (1977) influentially named \u201cappraisal\nrespect\u201d. This kind of respect is a positive evaluative\nattitude or feeling, which we express towards\nourselves or others, for some merit of character. In this sense,\nrespect is akin to esteem. Killmister writes:\n\n\nto be highly personally dignified is to be such that, by our own\nlights, we ought to hold ourselves in high esteem\u2026to be highly\nsocially dignified is to be such that, by the light of our community,\nthey ought to hold us in high esteem. (2020: 23)\n\n\nBy contrast, Killmister connects status dignity to what Darwall\ncalled, \u201crecognition respect\u201d. Recognition respect is a\nway of thinking about oneself or others. To recognize-respect\nsomeone (at least as Darwall first explained it) is to give\nappropriate weight to some fact about them in our practical\ndeliberations, and to restrict our choices or actions accordingly.\n\nKillmister thus argues,\n\n\nWe come to have status dignity, when we fall within a\nparticular [social] category, membership in which commands respectful\ntreatment from others in our community. (2020: 22)\n\n\nShe elaborates,\n\n\nstatus dignity does not call on others to esteem us, but\nrather to treat us in ways appropriate to the kind of thing\nwe are. (2020: 23, emphasis added)\n\n\nCorrespondingly, human dignity ends up as \u201can especially\nimportant instance\u201d of status dignity. And all humans deserve\nrecognition respect in virtue of the \u201cfact\u201d of their\nmembership in the category \u201chuman\u201d (2020:\n129\u201330).\n\nThis said, Killmister\u2019s conclusion diverges from Darwall\u2019s\nown account of human dignity, which is tied to a revision he made to\nhis theory of recognition respect, which connected recognition respect\nto the reciprocal \u201cauthority\u201d of second-personal address,\nas discussed in the earlier historical reflection on Pufendorf (see\n \u00a71.2.3\n above; and Darwall 2006, esp. p. 14). Note also that Killmister, like\nKateb, eschews thinking of \u201chuman\u201d as a natural kind, in\nfavor of understanding it as a social kind.\n",
