Linguistic determinism is the doctrine that the\nlanguage a person speaks both causes her to conceptualize the world in\ncertain ways and limits what she can think about by imposing\nboundaries on her conceptual system; as a result, people who speak\nvery different languages are likely to conceptualize the world in\ncorrespondingly different ways. Linguistic relativity is the\nweaker doctrine that the language one speaks influences how one\nthinks.\n\nLinguistic determinism is historically associated with the writings of\nBenjamin Lee Whorf (Whorf 1956). Whorf was especially interested in\nthe languages of the indigenous people of America. He famously argued\nthat the Hopi both speak and think about time in ways that are\nincongruent with European languages and thought. Rather than viewing\ntime as a continuum that flows evenly throughout the universe and that\ncan be broken up into countable events occurring in the past, present,\nand future, the Hopi are supposed to focus on change as a process.\nTheir conceptual system is also supposed to differ from ours in that\nit embodies a distinction between things that are or have been\naccessible to perception versus things that are not, where the latter\ncategory includes things in the future as well as mythical and mental\nconstructs.\n\nThe claim that the Hopi lack our concept of time has not stood up to\nscrutiny. Whorf used clumsy translations of Hopi speech that concealed\nthe extent to which they talk about time (references to yesterday,\ntomorrow, days of the week, lunar phases, etc.). More interestingly,\nWhorf provided no direct evidence of how the Hopi think. Instead, he\nused the circular reasoning that they don\u2019t think about\ntime as we do because they don\u2019t talk about time as we\ndo. In fact, the Hopi use numerous familiar devices for time keeping,\nsuch as calendar strings and sun dials, and their sensitivity to time\nis evident a wide variety of cultural practices (Pinker 1994).\n\nLinguistic determinism isn\u2019t an especially promising doctrine\nand has few adherents these days, but linguistic relativity is the\nsubject of a spirited debate (see Gumperz & Levinson 1996,\nBowerman & Levinson 2001, and Gentner & Goldin-Meadow 2003).\nSome recent examples of particular interest include whether language\ninfluences how we conceptualize spatial frames of reference (in\nnon-linguistic spatial reasoning) (e.g., Li & Gleitman 2002,\nLevinson et al. 2002, Levinson 2003, Li et al. 2011), spatial\nrelations (in non-linguistic reasoning) (e.g., Choi & Bowerman\n1991, Hespos & Spelke 2004), sex (the impact of grammatical\ngender) (e.g., Boroditsky, Schmidt, & Phillips 2003) and number\n(e.g., Gordon 2004, Pica et al. 2004, Laurence & Margolis\n2007).\n",
