First, we would lose the best reasons that we have for\nthinking that we are superior to everything else in the universe\n(since our cherished \u201creason\u201d would no longer be something\nthat we alone possess). Second, the possibility that we might be\n\u201csupplanted\u201d by machines would become a genuine worry: if\nthere were thinking machines, then very likely there would be machines\nthat could think much better than we can. Third, the possibility that\nwe might be \u201cdominated\u201d by machines would also become a\ngenuine worry: if there were thinking machines, who\u2019s to say\nthat they would not take over the universe, and either enslave or\nexterminate us?\n\nAs it stands, what we have here is not an argument against the claim\nthat machines can think; rather, we have the expression of various\nfears about what might follow if there were thinking machines. Someone\nwho took these worries seriously\u2014and who was persuaded that it\nis indeed possible for us to construct thinking machines\u2014might\nwell think that we have here reasons for giving up on the project of\nattempting to construct thinking machines. However, it would be a\nmajor task\u2014which we do not intend to pursue here\u2014to\ndetermine whether there really are any good reasons for taking these\nworries seriously.\n",
