Meritocracy: A Brief History\n\nBy tradition, Michael Young is credited with coining\n\u201cmeritocracy\u201d for his 1958 satire, The Rise of the\nMeritocracy. In fact, the term appeared in print two years\nearlier: In Jean Floud\u2019s \u201cSociology and Education\u201d,\nAlan Fox\u2019s \u201cClass and Equality\u201d, and Paul Lamartine\nYates\u2019s \u201cFairer Shares\u201d. Young claimed to have\ninvented it, which is certainly possible given that all four were\nEnglish academics who moved in similar, leftist circles. While only\nYoung explained what he meant by \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in any\ndetail (and his sentiments towards it were mixed), for these\nacademics, the term had a negative connotation.\n\nNow it has been claimed that \u201cmeritocracy\u201d first appeared\nin Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201c1954\u201d article \u201cThe Crisis\nin Education\u201d. And there are copies of this article, so dated,\ncirculating on the Internet which include the term. However,\n\u201cThe Crisis in Education\u201d came out in 1958 (and was based\non \u201ca lecture delivered at Bremen, May 13, 1958\u201d).\nFurther, \u201cmeritocracy\u201d does not appear in that original\nversion of Arendt\u2019s article. It does appear in edited reprints\nof it (e.g., Arendt 1961).\n\nOnly the briefest survey of the history of meritocracy can be provided\nhere. For the ideas that government should be populated by the\nmeritorious, and that a just distribution is merit-based, are\nubiquitous. As Louis Pojman says,\n\n\nit is interesting to observe how deeply the notion of justice as\ndesert or merit is embedded in human history. It seems a\nprereflective, basic idea of primordial or Ur-justice. One finds it\ngrounded in every known culture and religion. (1999: 90)\n\n\n(Pojman surveys some history; Wooldridge 2021 is more\ncomprehensive.)\n\nThere is an Eastern meritocratic tradition which has its roots in\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BC). This tradition has influenced political\nand social institutions in Asia and beyond and remains vibrant\n (\u00a73.1).\n (Meritocratic notions are found elsewhere in ancient Chinese thought,\ntoo; e.g., the Mohists [c. 400 BC] sought to \u201celevate the\nworthy\u201d into government for utilitarian reasons. See Pines\n2013.)\n\nThe core ideas of this tradition are found in Confucius, Mencius\n(372\u2013289 BC), and Xunzi (c. 310\u2013c. 235 BC). In short: The\npurpose of government is to promote the well-being and virtue of the\npeople. That requires that political power be wielded not on the basis\nof noble blood\u2014the prevailing system\u2014but virtue and\ntalent. Political leaders serve as role models and sage\ndecision-makers, and to do that they must be meritorious.\n\nSuch a system will create hierarchies. For these meritocrats, that is\nnot a problem. Indeed, it is natural and welcome:\n\n\nThat things are unequal is a matter of fact\u2026. If you rank them\nthe same, it will bring confusion to the world. If a roughly finished\nshoe sells at the same price as a finely finished one, who would make\nthe latter? \u2026 How can one govern a state in this way?\n(Mencius, 3A.4, trans. Bai [2020: 103])\n\n\nThe most famous realization of the Eastern meritocratic tradition was\nthe Imperial Examinations, which began in China during the Sui Dynasty\n(AD 581\u2013618). Until that point, entry into the state bureaucracy\nwas mainly controlled via nepotism and aristocratic\ninfluence. (Although there was some openness to granting political\npower to competent and virtuous people, even if they came from the\nlower class, since the Qin Dynasty [226\u2013206 BC]. For a\ndiscussion of meritocratic practices before the Imperial Examinations,\nsee Wang 2017.) The Imperial Examinations replaced, to some extent,\nthat route to power with a single, impartial, rigorous examination,\nwhich was open to the public. Although the Imperial Examinations were\ndiscontinued in the early twentieth century, similar civil service\nexaminations proliferated, and today are used world-wide (including in\nChina).\n\nThe Eastern meritocratic tradition is largely concerned with\ngovernance. It does not hold that other social goods, like\nnon-political jobs or income, should be distributed on the basis of\nmerit. And its justification is largely consequentialist: People will\nbe more virtuous, and better cared-for, if they are ruled by the\nmeritorious. Although some meritocratic institutions, like the\nImperial Examinations, might have laudable side-effects like improving\nsocial mobility, they are not generally justified on those\ngrounds.\n\nPlato\u2019s (c. 428\u2013c. 348 BC) meritocratic political theory\n(found primarily in the Laws, Republic, and\nStatesman) is similarly focused on governance. His argument\nfor meritocracy and against democracy is simple: Managing a state is\nhard. It requires specific skills, like bravery, sobriety,\ngraciousness, and love of wisdom. These skills are not found among the\ncommon people or the wealthy. If political power were entrusted to\nthem, the \u201cship of state\u201d (Republic\n488a\u201389c) would run aground. Not to mention, the\nsailors\u2014democratically-elected leaders\u2014are always\nsquabbling. Only a \u201ctrue pilot\u201d\u2014a\nphilosopher-king\u2014can safely guide his ship to its\ndestination. (See also, e.g., Republic 412a-e, 473c-d, and\n484a ff.)\n\nHow Plato justifies meritocracy is a debated matter of interpretation.\nOn one interpretation, meritocracy is desirable for its good\nconsequences; to wit, it brings justice and happiness to the state\n(and, by analogy, citizens\u2019 souls). On another interpretation,\nmeritocracy constitutes justice and happiness, which are\nintrinsically desirable. (On this interpretive issue, see, e.g., Brown\n2003 [2017].)\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BC) is different in that his concern (in the\nNicomachean Ethics and the Politics) is the\ndistribution of social goods generally\u2014not just political\noffices. And his justification for merit-based distribution is\nsquarely deontological. (At least, that is a common interpretation. On\nAristotle\u2019s theory of distributive justice, see, e.g., Keyt\n1991.)\n\nJustice is, for Aristotle, giving people what they deserve, and this\nhappens when they are rewarded in proportion to their merit. (This\nview is arguably presaged by Plato in the Laws [757c] and the\nRepublic [331e ff.]) Indeed, for Aristotle this is\nnot just correct but obvious: \u201cAll men agree that what is just\nin distribution must be according to merit\n[\u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03b1]\u201d (NE, 1131a, trans. Ross\n[1925]).\n\nAristotelian desert defines a notion of equality, known as\nproportional equality. (It is most frequently studied within\nsocial psychology, under the heading equity theory.) What\nAristotle seeks to equalize are the ratios of merits to\nrewards between persons.\n\nFor example, suppose that there are 100 units of some good to be\ndistributed among 3 persons. Persons A and B are\nequally meritorious; C is twice as meritorious as they are.\nJustice is done by giving 25 units of the good to A, 25 units\nto B, and 50 units to C. Note that an equal\ndistribution is just only in the special case in which all recipients\nare equally meritorious.\n\nNow, what is merit? For Aristotle, this is determined by the nature of\nthe thing being distributed:\n\n\nWhen a number of flute players are equal in their art, there is no\nreason why those of them who are better born should have better flutes\ngiven to them \u2026 the superior instrument should be reserved for\nhim who is the superior artist. (Politics, 1282b, trans.\nJowett [1885])\n\n\nMeritocratic ideas are found in Islamic philosophy, in which scholars\ndeveloped political theories compatible with divinely revealed Islamic\nlaw (Shar\u012b\u2019a). For example,\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (also known as Alpharabius, AD c.\n870\u2013c. 950) sought a political system which would bring\nhappiness and perfection to the people living under it. Democracy\ncould not do this (although it had, for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, some\nadmirable features). What is required, rather, is (i) a ruler who is a\nhybrid philosopher-king and prophet-im\u0101m, with\nqualifications drawn from both Platonic and Islamic thought, and (ii)\nan elaborated hierarchy between citizens. Similar ideas may be found\nin the work of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna, AD c. 980\u20131037),\nIbn B\u0101jja (Avempace, AD c. 1085\u2013c. 1139), and Ibn Rushd\n(Averroes, AD 1126\u20131198).\n\nFrancesco Patrizi of Siena (AD 1413\u20131494) argued that\nmerit\u2014understood as virtue\u2014was a precondition for the\nlegitimate exercise of political power. For Patrizi, a meritocratic\nstate is justified, stable, and functional. Further, the state is\nresponsible for inculcating virtue in its citizens so that they are\nsufficiently meritorious to participate in government. This requires,\namong other things, a public literacy program. Patrizi designed his\npolitical institutions to ensure that (i) only meritorious citizens\n(i.e., the educated and experienced) would be chosen as magistrates\nand senators, and (ii) wealthy and powerful families could not corrupt\nthe political process. (On the almost-forgotten Patrizi, see Hankins\n2023.)\n\nMeritocracy was an important Enlightenment value. Thinkers in Europe\nand elsewhere sought grounds for regarding people as individuals\n(rather than undifferentiated group members) and replacing monarchical\npolitics.\n\nFor instance, Article VI of the Declaration of the Rights of Man\nand of the Citizen (1789) says:\n\n\nAll citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, shall be equally\neligible to all dignities, public positions and occupations, according\nto their ability, and without distinction except that of their virtues\nand talents.\n\n\nThis is almost precisely the meritocratic rule for distributing jobs\n (\u00a74.2).\n\nNapoleon lived up to this principle, adopting the slogan la\ncarri\u00e8re est ouverte aux talents\u2014careers open to\ntalents\u2014and ascribing his success (not entirely, of course) to\nthe meritocratic nature of his reign.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Thomas Jefferson desired a \u201cnatural\naristocracy\u201d for his new nation, in which hierarchies would\nreflect \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d rather than \u201cwealth and\nbirth\u201d. Indeed, Jefferson regarded this natural aristocracy as\n\u201cthe most precious gift of nature, for the \u2026 government\nof society\u201d (1813).\n\nThere is also a meritocratic ideal of justice associated with the\nUnited States. This is the American Dream, expressed by the\nperson who coined the phrase thus:\n\n\nIt is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of\na social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to\nattain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and\nbe recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the\nfortuitous circumstances of birth or position. (James Adams 1931:\n404)\n\n\nThe suggestion is that a just state is one in which there is equal\nopportunity and people are judged on their merits\n (\u00a74).\n",
