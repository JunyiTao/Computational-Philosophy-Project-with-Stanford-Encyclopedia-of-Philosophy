    "main_text": "Origins and Development of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || The Theory of Descriptions\n2.3 The Theory of Descriptions\n\n In POM, Russell expressed the view that grammar is a useful\nguide in understanding the make-up of a proposition, and even that in\nmany cases, the make-up of a proposition corresponding to a sentence\ncan be understood by determining, for each word of the sentence, what\nentity in the proposition is meant by the word (POM,\n46). Perhaps in part because such phrases as \u201call dogs\u201d, \u201csome\nnumbers\u201d and \u201cthe queen\u201d appear as a grammatical unit, Russell came to\nthe conclusion that they made a unified contribution to the\ncorresponding proposition.  Because Russell believed it impossible for\na finite mind to grasp a proposition of infinite complexity, however,\nRussell rejected a view according to which the (false) proposition\ndesignated by\n\nAll numbers are odd.\n\n\n \nactually contains all numbers (POM, 145). Similarly,\nalthough Russell admitted that such a proposition as (1) is equivalent\nto a formal implication, i.e., a quantified conditional of the\nform:\n\n(x)(x is a number \u2283 x is\nodd)\n\n\n \nRussell held that they are nevertheless distinct propositions\n(POM,  74). This was perhaps in part due to the difference\nin grammatical structure, and perhaps also because the former appears\nonly to be about numbers, whereas the latter is about all things,\nwhether numbers or not. Instead, Russell thought that the proposition\ncorresponding to (1) contains as a constituent the denoting concept\nall numbers. As Russell explained them, when denoting concepts \noccur in a proposition, the proposition is not about them but about \nother entities to which the denoting concepts bear a special\nrelation. So when the denoting concept all numbers occurs in\na proposition, the proposition is not about the denoting concept, but\ninstead about 1 and 2 and 3, etc.\n\n \nIn 1905, Russell abandoned this theory in favor of his celebrated\ntheory of definite and indefinite descriptions outlined in the paper\n\u201cOn Denoting\u201d. What precisely lead Russell to become dissatisfied with\nhis earlier theory, and the precise nature of the argument he gave\nagainst denoting concepts (and similar entities such as Frege\u2019s\nsenses), are a matter of great controversy, and have given rise to\na large body of secondary literature.  For present purposes, it can\nmerely be noted that Russell professed an inability to understand the\nlogical form of propositions about denoting concepts\nthemselves, as in the claim that \u201cThe present King of France\nis a denoting concept\u201d (cf. OD, 48\u201350). According to the\nnew theory adopted, the proposition expressed by (1) was now\nidentified with that expressed by a quantified conditional such as\n(2). Similarly, the proposition expressed by\n\nSome number is odd.\n\n\n \nwas identified with the existentially quantified conjunction\nrepresented by\n\n(\u2203x)(x is a number & x\nis odd)\n\n\n \nPerhaps most notoriously, Russell argued that a proposition involving\na definite description, e.g.,\n\n\nThe King of France is bald.\n\n\n \nwas to be understood as having the structure of a certain kind of\nexistential statement, in this case:\n\n(\u2203x)(x is King of France\n & (y)(y is King of France \u2283 x =\n y) & x is\n bald)\n\n\n \nRussell cited in favor of these theories that they provided an elegant\nsolution to certain philosophical puzzles. One involves how it is that\na proposition can be meaningful even if it involves a description or\nother denoting phrase that does not denote anything. Given the above\naccount of the structure of the proposition expressed by \u201cthe King of\nFrance is bald\u201d, while France and the relation of being King\nof are constituents, there is no constituent directly\ncorresponding to the whole phrase \u201cthe King of France\u201d. The proposition in\nquestion is false, since there is no value of x which would\nmake it true. One is not committed to a nonexistent entity such as the\nKing of France simply in order to understand the make-up of the\nproposition.  Secondly, this theory provides an answer to how it is\nthat certain identity statements can be both true and informative. On\nthe above theory, the proposition corresponding to:\n\nThe author of Waverly = Scott\n\n\n \nwould be understood as having the following structure:\n\n(\u2203x)(x\n authored Waverly & (y)(y\n authored Waverly \u2283 x =\n y) & x = Scott)\n\n\n \nIf instead, the proposition corresponding to (7) was simply a complex\nconsisting of the relation of identity, Scott, and the author of\nWaverly himself, since the author of Waverly simply is Scott,\nthe proposition would be the same as the uninformative proposition\nScott = Scott. By showing that the actual structure of the\nproposition is quite a bit different from what it appears from the\ngrammar of the sentence \u201cThe author of Waverly = Scott\u201d, Russell\nbelieved he had shown how it might be more informative than a trivial\ninstance of the law of identity (OD, 51\u201354).\n\n \nThe theory of \u201cOn Denoting\u201d did away with Russell\u2019s temptation to\nregard grammar as a very reliable guide towards understanding the\nstructure or make-up of a proposition. Especially important in this\nregard is the notion of an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d, by which Russell\nunderstood an expression that can be meaningful in the context of its\nuse within a sentence, but does not by itself correspond to a\nconstituent or unified part of the corresponding\nproposition. According to the theory of \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, phrases such as\n\u201cthe King of France\u201d, or \u201cthe author of Waverly\u201d were to be understood\nas \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d in this sense. The general notion of an\n\u201cincomplete symbol\u201d was applied by Russell in ways beyond the theory\nof descriptions, and perhaps most importantly, to his understanding of\nclasses.\n",
