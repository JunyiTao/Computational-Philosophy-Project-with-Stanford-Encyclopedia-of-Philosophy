Biography\n\nK\u016bkai grew up during the Nara period (710\u2013784CE) when the\nNara Buddhist schools flourished and the country was centralized under\nthe rule of the imperial family. And he was active during the\nbeginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185CE) when\ninstitutionalized Nara Buddhism underwent reform due to the influence\nof newer ideas coming from China, including K\u016bkai\u2019s own\nimportations. He comes from an aristocratic family, the Saeki, and as\na boy, he was educated by his maternal uncle, a Confucian scholar. At\nthe age of seventeen or eighteen, he entered the state university at\nthe then-capital Nagaoka but was soon disillusioned with its Confucian\neducation. He suddenly dropped out of the university and retired into\nthe natural setting of the mountains, where as legend has it, he\ndevoted himself to various forms of esoteric practices. A few years\nlater at the age of 24, he completed the final version of his first\ntreatise, the Sang\u014d sh\u012bki (Indications of the\nGoals of the Three Teachings) that covers and compares the\nteachings of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Herein one can\ndiscern K\u016bkai\u2019s reasons for turning from Confucianism to\nBuddhism. In the text, K\u016bkai relates how as a student he met a\nBuddhist priest who taught him an esoteric meditative practice called\nthe Kok\u016bz\u014dgumonji no ho\n(\u201c\u0100k\u0101\u015bagarbha\u2019s method for seeking hearing\nand retaining\u201d), which involved the recitation of a mantra a\nmillion times and was supposed to endow the practitioner with\nmiraculous powers of memory and understanding.\n\nWhat K\u016bkai found in Buddhism was a concrete path towards\nenlightenment (and liberation from suffering) that involves bodily\npractice and direct experience rather than mere theoretical\nspeculation. K\u016bkai however did not involve himself in the\nofficial schools of the Nara Buddhist orthodoxy for they emphasized\nthe exegetical study of the scriptures without providing any\ntheoretical grounding for ritual practice. Instead he remained in the\nremote mountain regions of his native Shikoku as an unofficial and\nprivately ordained mendicant. It appears that between the ages of 24\nand 31, he wandered through its various mountains and sacred sites,\npracticing asceticism. Noticing the many different branches and\ns\u016btras (scriptures) of Buddhism, he hoped to find its\nunifying essence that would also bridge the gap between ritual and\nexperience on the one hand and doctrine and theory on the other hand.\nIt was during this search that he came across the mid-seventh century\nesoteric Buddhist text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d (Skrt:\nMah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra; Chn: Ta-ji Ching;\n\u201cGreat Sun scripture\u201d). Intuiting that this text, with its\ndual emphasis upon esoteric practice and doctrine, would provide the\nkind of knowledge that he was seeking, K\u016bkai decided to travel to\nChina to study it.\n\nIt was only in 804 at the age of 30 or 31 that K\u016bkai was thus\nofficially ordained so that he could travel with an official\ngovernment embassy to China. He travelled to Ch\u2019ang-an, the\ngreat cosmopolitan capital of the T\u2019ang (Tang) dynasty, where he\nresided for thirty months. During this period, he studied Indian\nBuddhism, Hindu teachings, and Sanskrit with two Indian monks. But\nmore significantly he met Hui-kuo (Huiguo; Jpn: Keika)\n(746\u2013805), the seventh patriarch of Chen-yen (Zhenyan; Jpn:\nShingon; Skrt: Mantray\u0101na) Buddhism, from whom he received\ninitiation into the two lineages of Chen-yen esoteric Buddhism, one\ncentered around the Vajradh\u0101tu (Diamond realm) mandala based on\nthe Vajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra (\u201cAdamantine {or\nDiamond} Pinnacle scripture\u201d) and the other focussing upon the\nGarbha (Womb) mandala based on the Mah\u0101vairocana\nS\u016btra. K\u016bkai\u2019s accomplishment during his stay in\nChina is phenomenal in that not only did he manage to succeed Hui-kuo\nin becoming the eighth patriarch of esoteric Buddhism, he also managed\nto study Sanskrit, Chinese poetry and calligraphy, and various other\nminor arts.\n\nK\u016bkai returned to Japan in 806 at the age of 33. He arrived in\nKyushu with a voluminous amount of s\u016btras, collections of mandala\npaintings, treatises and commentaries, books of poetry, and ritual\nparaphernalia. In Kyushu, he composed the Shorai mokuroku\n(A Memorial Presenting a List of Newly Imported S\u016btras and\nOther Items) that gives a brief account of his activities in\nChina, describes what distinguishes esoteric Buddhism, and lists the\nitems he had collected and brought back to Japan. However he was not\npermitted to enter the capital due to political unrest and was obliged\nto remain in Kyushu for another three years. Only with the retirement\nof Emperor Heizei (r. 806\u2013809), did the new Emperor Saga order\nK\u016bkai in 809 to move to the new capital of Kyoto to reside at\nTakaosan-ji, the center of the Kyoto Buddhist world, where he remained\nuntil 823. Under the patronage of the new emperor, K\u016bkai became\nappointed over the years to various administrative positions of\nseveral important official temples. This allowed him to perform the\nfirst public esoteric ritual for \u201cnation-protection,\u201d\nfollowed by other public esoteric ceremonies, including mass\ninitiation rituals and the founding of an annual ritual (the\nMishuh\u014d) to be held at court, hence gaining official\nrecognition for the efficacy of esoteric Buddhism and preparing the\nrise of Buddhism as an ideological force in medieval Japan.\n\nIt was during his period at Takaosan-ji that he wrote some of his\nmajor treatises of philosophical interest to us, such as\nBenkenmitsu nikky\u014dron (Treatise on the Differences\nBetween Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) around 814, and the\nso-called Sanbu-sho (\u201cThree Writings\u201d) of\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi (On the Meaning of\n\u201cAttaining Buddhahood in this Very Embodied\nExistence\u201d), Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi (On the\nMeanings of \u201cSound, Sign, and Reality\u201d), and\nUnjigi (On the Meaning of the Syllable\nH\u016b\u1e43) in the 820s. And towards the end of his life he\ncompleted in 830 what has been considered to be his magnum\nopus, the Himitsu mandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron\n(Treatise on the Ten States of the Mind as a Secret Mandala)\nin ten volumes, and soon afterward, completed its summary version, the\nHiz\u014d h\u014dyaku (The Precious Key to the Secret\nTreasury) in three volumes. \n\nIn 816 K\u016bkai began building a monastic center in Mt. K\u014dya,\nand there he died in 835 at the age of 61. In 921, he posthumously\nreceived from Emperor Daigo and his court, the honorific title,\nK\u014db\u014d Daishi (\u201cGreat Teacher Who Spread the\nDharma\u201d).\n2. Historical Background of Esoteric Buddhism\n\nK\u016bkai called his form of Buddhism, Shingon, which means\n\u201cthe word of truth.\u201d This is the Japanese pronunciation of\nthe Chinese chen-yen (zhenyan) and the Sanskrit\nmantra. The form of Buddhism that he learned in China was an\nimportation from India of Mantray\u0101na (Mantra vehicle\n{or: \u201cschool\u201d}) Buddhism, more often known as\nVajray\u0101na (Diamond {or: \u201cLightning Fast\u201d}\nvehicle). The word mantra signifies a secret teaching\ninexpressible in ordinary words or linguistic formulations. This form\nof Buddhism, whose origin dates back to the mid-seventh century India,\nis more popularly known today in the West as \u201cTantric\nBuddhism,\u201d especially in its Tibetan incarnation. It is\ncharacterized by its emphasis upon rituals, involving the use of\nmantras, mandalas, and other means in order to control both body and\nmind to experience the \u201cultimate.\u201d Two major texts,\nassociated with this form of Buddhism, made their way into China from\nIndia: Mah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra (Jpn:\nDainichi-ky\u014d) from the mid-seventh century and\nVajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra (Jpn:\nKong\u014dch\u014d-gy\u014d) from the later-seventh century.\nMantray\u0101na made its way east to China during the T\u2019ang\ndynasty (713\u2013765) around the beginning of the eighth century\nthrough the translating and propagating efforts of the Indian priests\n\u015aubh\u0101karasimha (Jpn: Zenmui; 637\u2013735) who brought the\nMah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra to China; Vajrabodhi (Jpn:\nKong\u014dchi; 671\u2013741), the sixth patriarch of Mantray\u0101na,\nwho brought the Vajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra to China; and\nAmoghavajra (Jpn: Fuk\u016b, an abbreviation for Fuk\u016bkong\u014d;\n705\u201374), Vajrabodhi\u2019s disciple, who won the support of\nsuccessive emperors during the T\u2019ang period; and the Chinese\npriest, I-hsing (Yixing; Jpn: Ichigy\u014d; 683\u2013727) who learned\nthe teachings of Mah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra from\n\u015aubh\u0101karasimha and the teachings of Vajra\u015bekhara\nS\u016btra from Varjabodhi. K\u016bkai\u2019s own teacher\nHui-kuo had also received initiation under both lineages of these two\nmajor s\u016btras, and is credited with gathering together their\nteachings into one system. In the meantime during the eighth century,\nanother branch of Mantray\u0101na made it north from India to Tibet.\nBut Chen-yen Buddhism in China did not survive the severe persecution\nof Buddhism in general in 845. K\u016bkai however had by then already\nsucceeded in transmitting to Japan the esoteric doctrines he had\nstudied in China. For much of the doctrines and practices, which he\nhad imported, became influential amongst the official Nara\nmonasteries. But his form of Buddhism was not just a product of his\ninheritance and appropriation of the Buddhism he encountered in China.\nAs it involved developments and contributions uniquely his own, we may\nregard him not only as the transmitter but as the founder of\nthe Japanized version of Mantray\u0101na known as\nShingon.\n3. Thought\n\nK\u016bkai has been regarded as the first comprehensively\nphilosophical thinker in Japanese intellectual history. The influence\nof Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy is noticeable but they are\ninterpreted through the lens of Mantray\u0101na with its emphasis upon\nthe inseparability of ritual practice from theoretical doctrine.\nTraditionally, his thought has been divided into the following\naspects: 1) the theoretical (ky\u014ds\u014d) which\nexplicates the uniqueness and distinction of esoteric Buddhism\n(mikky\u014d) as opposed to exoteric Buddhism\n(kengy\u014d) and demonstrates its validity and\nefficaciousness; and 2) the practical (jis\u014d), which\nprescribes his method of meditation and ritual. Ultimately however the\ntheoretical and the practical are inseparable in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nthought. Within the deep profundity and subtleties of his doctrine,\none recognizes philosophical elements inherited from Madhyamaka,\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai (Tiantai), and Huayen\n(Huayan) Buddhist thought. But with these are incorporated the\nelements of devotional piety and magico-esoteric practice even in his\ntheoretical writings. What is especially pronounced and distinct in\nhis thought is the significance of bodily experience and practice.\nBuddhist truths for K\u016bkai were not simply meant to be\nintellectually mused over but to be experienced through bodily\npractice. One might say then that for K\u016bkai it is the body\nthat provides the medium whereby theory and practice, doctrine and\nritual, thought and experience, are non-dualistic.\n\nA major contribution made by K\u016bkai for the orthodoxy of Nara\nBuddhism with his systematization of esoteric doctrines, was to bridge\nthe gap between textual study and ritual practice. K\u016bkai\u2019s\nworks provided for the first time a theoretical grounding for the\nincantation of mantras and dh\u0101ran\u012bs and other\nesoteric practices already present in Nara Buddhism. It did this by\nexplicating their relationship to the doctrines expressed in the\nscriptural texts. While esoteric elements were already present in Nara\nBuddhism, their very raison d\u2019etre, other than as forms\nof magic, and their very connection to Buddhist doctrines had been\nleft in the dark. K\u016bkai\u2019s success may be attributable to\nhis ability to provide a sound and intelligible systematic exposition\nof the meanings of the esoteric elements of Buddhism and of the\ninterrelationships between text, ritual, and icon. In doing so it\nsucceeded in bridging the gap between esoteric rituals and scriptural\ndoctrines. (Abe 1999, 11) K\u016bkai had to work out such an\nexposition in order to establish and legitimize the independence and\nrole of his Shingon Buddhism vis-\u00e0-vis the other forms of\nBuddhism already existent in Nara Japan.\n3.1 Works\n\nOf K\u016bkai\u2019s so-called theoretical works, the philosophically\nmost significant are Benkenmitsu nikky\u014dron, Himitsu\nmandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron, Hiz\u014d h\u014dyaku,\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi, and\nUnjigi. The former three provide comparative analyses\nexploring what distinguishes Shingon esoteric Buddhism from other\nforms of religious thought and practice, including the exoteric forms\nof Buddhism. The latter three are expositions of the Shingon worldview\nand its concepts, and are grouped together to comprise the so-called\nSanbu-sho (\u201cThree Writings\u201d). Benkenmitsu\nnikky\u014dron (2 vols.) written in 814/815 sets forth the\ndifferences between esoteric and exoteric Buddhism to emphasize the\nsuperiority of the former. Starting from this foundation (i.e. of the\ndistinction and superiority of the esoteric standpoint), K\u016bkai\ncomposed the Sanbu-sho, in rapid succession from around 821\nto 824. These \u201cThree Writings\u201d provide expositions of what\ncommentators have called the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of Shingon,\ndealing in detail with the three so-called mysterious aspects of the\ncosmic truth (Dharma): its \u201cbody, speech, and mind.\u201d\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi explicates the concept of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu or enlightenment in one\u2019s\nimmediate embodied existence. Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi and\nUnjigi are unique works of a \u201cmetaphysical\nlinguistics.\u201d They examine the interrelationship (which is\nultimately non-dualistic) between the phenomenal world, its sounds (or\n\u201cvoices\u201d) as \u201csigns\u201d (or\n\u201cletters\u201d), and reality itself, the \u201cmeaning,\u201d\nthey convey. In doing so, those two works explicate the Shingon\nconcept of hosshin sepp\u014d, the Buddha\u2019s preaching\nof the Dharma via cosmic phenomena. In fact all three of\nthese \u201cThree Writings\u201d deal with the embodied realization\nof the Dharma. But they do this from the different angles of the\nmicrocosm of the human body and the macrocosm of the cosmic body.\nEmbodiment then plays an important role in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nBuddhism. As we shall see below, the embodiment of the Dharma as such\nalso involves the incorporation of the mantra and the mandala along\nwith other esoteric features. The work that represents the culmination\nof K\u016bkai\u2019s thought, completed at the age of 57 in 830, is\nhis J\u016bj\u016bshinron (10 vols.) along with its abridged\nversion, Hiz\u014d h\u014dyaku (3 vols.). These two works\nposition Shingon esotericism as the culmination of all Buddhist and\nreligious standpoints. They make the grand claim that Shingon provides\nthe most comprehensive view to truth, the Dharma. All other religious\nviews on the other hand are mere approximations of that truth in\nvarious degrees and from various perspectives. Each religious\nstandpoint then corresponds to a specific level of development of the\nhuman mind, which in ten states leads up to the enlightened mind. The\nfinal culminating stage of enlightenment then is what corresponds to\nShingon doctrine as the most comprehensive, and hence \u201cmost\ntrue.\u201d Nevertheless, the pre-Shingon and exoteric teachings each\nhave their rightful place within this scheme so that they are not\nutterly discounted. In addition to the above-mentioned six major\nworks, there is also K\u016bkai\u2019s first work \u2013 written\nprior to his trip to China \u2013, the Sang\u014dsh\u012bki.\nThis was his first look at Buddhism in comparison with Taoism and\nConfucianism. In the following however, I shall focus on\nK\u016bkai\u2019s thought in the six major works. These are his\nmature works, and also universally recognized as his most important\ntheoretical works.\n3.2 Esoteric (Mikky\u014d) vs. Exoteric (Kengy\u014d)\n\nIn Benkenmitsu nikky\u014dron, K\u016bkai sets out to\nestablish the basic differences between the brand of Buddhism he was\nintroducing to Japan, which he regarded as \u201cesoteric\nteachings\u201d (mikky\u014d; \u201csecret teaching\u201d)\non the one hand, and the forms of Buddhism already officially\nrecognized and practiced in Japan, which he classified as\n\u201cexoteric teachings\u201d (kengy\u014d;\n\u201crevealed teaching,\u201d \u201cpublic teaching\u201d). This\ndistinction between \u201cesoteric\u201d (mitsu) and\n\u201cexoteric\u201d (ken) Buddhism is not found in his\nIndian predecessors. But some of his Japanese predecessors had already\nbeen using the binary ken-mitsu categories.\nK\u016bkai\u2019s contribution was to interpret them in a new way\nthrough appropriation of the esoteric texts he had brought back from\nChina. In K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking, that distinction is crucial.\nWhile we shall discuss some of these ideas in the following sections\nwith greater depth, we may here summarize the general distinctions\nlaid out in Benkenmitsu nikky\u014dron for now as follows: 1)\nFor exoteric Buddhism, the \u201cembodiment of truth\u201d (Skrt:\ndharmak\u0101ya; Jpn: hosshin) is abstract and\ntranscendent and hence does not preach. But for esoteric Buddhism, the\nphenomenal world from the enlightened perspective \u2013 that is, the\nstandpoint of the Buddha \u2013 is the preaching activity of\nthe cosmic Buddha Dainichi (Skrt: Mah\u0101vairocana) and\nas that \u201cembodiment of truth.\u201d Hence while\nexoteric teachings may be traced to \u015aakyamuni, the historical\nBuddha, esoteric teachings come directly from the Buddha Dainichi. 2)\nFor exoteric Buddhism, the absolute truth, i.e., the Dharma,\ntranscends world and language, and thus cannot be explained. But for\nesoteric Buddhism, that Dharma itself is being perpetually expressed\nin and as its embodiment in the phenomenal world, in\nits sounds, movements, and forms, and even in the thoughts of sentient\nbeings. In other words, its embodiment refers not only to the\nmeditation of the Buddha but also to the Buddha\u2019s creative and\ncommunicative activities. 3) Exoteric Buddhism lacks, according to\nK\u016bkai, a practical methodology for experiencing esoteric\ntruths. While exoteric Buddhism emphasizes the intellectual study and\ncomprehension of the doctrines set forth in the s\u016btras, esoteric\nBuddhism provides a bodily hermeneutic whereby esoteric truths hidden\nin the s\u016btras as well as in the world at large can be\nexperienced. And: 4) For exoteric Buddhism, it takes three infinitely\nlong epochs of repeated rebirths of training in order for one to\nattain enlightenment (Buddhahood); but esoteric Buddhism makes it\npossible for anyone, irrespective of karmic dispositions, to\nimmediately become a buddha in one\u2019s present embodied state.\n3.3 The Esoteric View of the Buddha: The Four Embodiments of Truth (the Dharma)\n\nIn order to understand the above-mentioned distinctions made by\nK\u016bkai, we need to comprehend what exactly the Buddha signifies\nfor K\u016bkai. This is also important as his esoteric view of the\nBuddha underlies all of the major points of his philosophy that we\nshall be discussing further below.\n\nIn traditional Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist theory, the Buddha is\nconceived in terms of three modes or forms of embodiments\n(trik\u0101ya): dharmak\u0101ya (Jpn:\nhosshin), nirmanak\u0101ya, and\nsambhogak\u0101ya. While originally the term buddha,\nmeaning \u201cenlightened one,\u201d was reserved for\n\u015aakyamuni, the historical founder of Buddhism, it eventually came\nto designate the ideal for humanity. This ideal became equated with\nthe \u201ctruth\u201d (Skrt: Dharma; Jpn:\nh\u014d), taught by the Buddha, of the nature of being. To be\na \u201cbuddha\u201d is then to be enlightened to that truth, which\ncame to also mean the realization of one\u2019s non-duality with the\nDharma. It is in this significance that one way of understanding the\nBuddha is in terms of the universal \u201cembodiment of the\nDharma\u201d (Skrt: dharmak\u0101ya; Jpn: hosshin).\nFor traditional Mah\u0101y\u0101na, this hosshin is an\nabstract principle and hence impersonal and non-preaching. However as\nimplied in the foregoing section, for K\u016bkai the hosshin\nis identified with the Buddha Dainichi. That is, in one aspect the\nhosshin may be understood to be a personal being who preaches\nthe Dharma by concretizing it in the cosmos as his own body. (Of\ncourse though to avoid anthropomorphism, the hosshin cannot\nbe reduced to this aspect.) In the traditional three-body doctrine,\nhowever, it is the other two forms of embodiment that preach. The\nBuddha, when regarded as embodying the Dharma in an historical earthly\nbeing, such as \u015aakyamuni, who preaches the Dharma to humans, is\ncalled the nirmanak\u0101ya (\u201cembodiment of\ntransformation\u201d). And the Buddha as enjoying his fruits of\nenlightenment by residing in a celestial buddha-realm, while unfolding\nfurther truths for advanced bodhisattva beings and acting as a savior\nto the earthly, is called the sambhogak\u0101ya\n(\u201cembodiment of bliss\u201d). An example of would be Amida\nresiding in his \u201cPure Land.\u201d\n\nWhat distinguishes K\u016bkai\u2019s understanding of the Buddha is\nthat he takes the notion of the \u201cembodiment of the Dharma\u201d\nliterally and radically. Hosshin in Shingon thought is not an\nabstract truth transcending the mundane world. Rather all\nphenomena and thing-events of this cosmos, in their very transience,\nare each themselves embodiments of truth and the cosmos as a whole\ncomprised of these impermanent and interdependent beings is eternally\nan embodiment of truth, the hosshin. Moreover this concrete\ncosmic identification between Buddha, truth, and the cosmos of\nthing-events, was \u201cpersonal.\u201d That is, hosshin\nwas equated with the Buddha Dainichi. The cosmos as the\nmanifestation of truth, the Dharma, was itself hence equated with the\nbody of the personal Buddha Dainichi. And in turn, Dainichi with his\ncosmic body is then the embodied personification of the universal\nBuddha-nature inherent in all beings and the Dharma that is manifest\neverywhere. Prior to Hui-kuo, this identification of Dainichi with the\nhosshin in Mantray\u0101na Buddhism was ambiguous and not\nthorough. In the Dainichi-ky\u014d, a sun metaphor is used to\nname its central Buddha, \u201cDainichi\u201d\n(Mah\u0101vairocana, transliterated as\nMakabirushana), meaning \u201cGreat Sun,\u201d as the being\nwhose light illuminates and enlightens all beings in a way akin to the\nsun\u2019s life-giving light. All other deities are seen as\nmanifestations of this light. Dainichi\u2019s identification with the\nhosshin nevertheless remains ambiguous. While he probably\ninfluenced K\u016bkai in regards to this equation, Hui-kuo himself\nhowever left no written explications. K\u016bkai thus has been\nregarded as the first to provide a complete and systematic exposition\nof the nature of the Buddha Dainichi as the hosshin.\nThe sun metaphor of illumination \u2013 as the source of both being\nand of knowledge (enlightenment) \u2013 befits the universality of\nthe hosshin perfectly. The illumination of the \u201cGreat\nSun\u201d (Dainichi) becomes accordingly understood to mean the\nomnipresencing of the Dharma throughout the cosmos, an omnipresencing\nin turn equated with the Buddha\u2019s preaching. This\n\u201cproof\u201d that the hosshin does in fact preach\nhelped K\u016bkai in distinguishing his esoteric doctrines from those\nof exoteric Buddhism.\n\nThis identification between Dainichi and hosshin held many\nimplications for K\u016bkai, which became worked out in his various\ndoctrines. For example, the equation of Dainichi\u2019s body-and-mind\nwith the cosmos itself also means the immanent presence of the Buddha\nwithin, and as, the body-and-mind of each and every one of\nus. And so Dainichi\u2019s \u201cenlightened mind\u201d\n(bodhicitta) becomes synonymous with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ndoctrine of \u201coriginal enlightenment\u201d (hongaku)\nwithin all beings. But as the Dharma signifies the interdependent\norigination, hence, emptiness (k\u016b) of all beings, its\nembodiment may be said to be an \u201cempty body.\u201d We will\nexamine these ideas in greater detail later.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s Shingon Buddhism postulated four forms of\nembodiment as the hosshin itself. This notion of the\nfour forms of the hosshin (shishu hosshin) roughly\ncorresponds to, while reworking, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ntrik\u0101ya doctrine. 1) First there is the hosshin\nin its absolute sense, called jish\u014d hosshin.\nThis is the embodiment of the Dharma as Dainichi eternally remaining\nin the state of samadhi but also engaging in a monologue,\nwhich reveals its \u201cself-nature\u201d and unfolds the Dharma\nthrough its omni-presencing manifestations in the cosmos. 2) Secondly\nthere is the juy\u016b hosshin, which is the\nhosshin enjoying bliss. But this is characterized in its two\naspects: A) \u201cthe self-oriented embodiment\u201d\n(jijuy\u016bshin) describing the hosshin as enjoying\nits own state of samadhic bliss; and B) \u201cthe\nother-oriented embodiment\u201d (tajuy\u016bshin) describing\nthe hosshin in the form of various celestial buddhas\ndirecting the blissful fruits of self-enlightenment for the benefit of\nothers. 3) Thirdly there is the hosshin in its historical and\nearthly transformation, called henge hosshin as\nmanifest in the enlightened personage of \u015aakyamuni. This\nhistorical Buddha guides ordinary, ignorant, and irreligious people\ntowards the Dharma, but for this sake must improvise skillful (or:\nexpedient) means (Skrt: up\u0101ya; Jpn: h\u014dben)\nappropriate to the time, place, and comprehension of a given audience.\n4) And fourthly there is the hosshin in its universal\nemanation, called t\u014dru hosshin. This is its\nmanifestation in all sorts of bodily forms appropriate to the\nsituation in order to expound the Dharma, often appearing in the same\nform as the listener in order to share in his suffering. This\nconception also became generalized by K\u016bkai to include all\nphenomenal thing-events \u2013 together with their respective\nenvironments or \u201crealms\u201d \u2013 as \u201cbodies\u201d\nfilling up the entire cosmos. As such every phenomenon plays the role\nof a \u201cbuddha,\u201d teaching some aspect of the Dharma and\nexpressing the Buddha\u2019s enlightened wisdom and compassion, to\nrealize the original enlightenment of all. Interestingly this implies\nthat each one of us are already buddhas expounding some\naspect of the Dharma to one another, but which we must then become\naware of in order to realize our own Buddhahood.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the celestial buddhas and the\nhistorical buddha (\u015aakyamuni) are here included as themselves\nforms of the hosshin, when in the traditional\ntrik\u0101ya doctrine of Mah\u0101y\u0101na, they were\ndistinguished from the hosshin, which in turn was seen as\nabstract and impersonal. Furthermore, according to this doctrine of\nthe four forms of the hosshin, it is not only the celestial\nbuddhas in the heavens and the historical buddha on earth who preach,\nbut all four forms. From K\u016bkai\u2019s esoteric\nstandpoint, the hosshin even in its samadhic\nself-enjoyment is preaching the Dharma in its cosmic monologue \u2013\nfor its very embodiment is the cosmos itself so that its\nsamadhic experiencing of the Dharma permeates everywhere and\neverywhen. Simply put, Dainichi as the hosshin and\nas the personification of the Dharma concretely embodied in\nthe cosmos, is directly preaching the Dharma to the world via\nhis omni-presencing being. And while in the broader sense the\nhosshin is thus preaching via the cosmos, in the\nnarrower sense its preaching is manifest in the teachings of esoteric\nBuddhism itself. On the other hand the doctrines of what K\u016bkai\nclassified as exoteric are traced to either what the historical\nbuddha, \u015aakyamuni, preached or what the celestial buddhas are\npreaching in the heavenly dimensions. Insofar as they themselves are\nembodiments of the hosshin, what they preach are indirectly\nteachings of the hosshin. But their teachings are\nprovisional, relative only to the comprehension of their audience and\nthe circumstance of time and place wherein they are preached.\nK\u016bkai claims, however, that through training in Shingon\nesotericism, one can receive the teachings of the hosshin\ndirectly \u2013 that is, receive the timeless and absolute,\ncosmic and holistic, truth of the Dharma in its very embodiment. This\nwas a radical and heterodox claim at the time since the teaching\ncommon to all orthodox Buddhist schools was that the s\u016btras can\nall be traced back to the preachings of \u015aakyamuni and this\nlineage is what legitimated their use of the s\u016btras. But for\nK\u016bkai, the historical Buddha was but one manifestation of the\ncosmic Buddha, Dainichi, who embodies the truth (Dharma,\nh\u014d) it preaches as the hosshin.\n3.4 The Three Aspects of the Embodiment of Truth (Hosshin; Dharmak\u0101ya)\n\nIn addition to its four forms of embodiment, K\u016bkai (in his\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi chs. 3, 4, 5) systematically\nelucidates three aspects as belonging to the hosshin in its\ncosmic significance: the six universal elements (rokudai) as\ncomprising its own body or somaticity (hontai), the four\nmandalas (shimandara) as constituting its \u201cmarks\u201d\nor forms of appearance (y\u014ds\u014d), and the three\nmysteries (sanmitsu) constituting its functions\n(say\u014d). In all three aspects, there is involved an\ninterrelationship of non-duality between its macro-cosmic significance\nand its micro-cosmic significance, that is, between the\nhosshin qua cosmos as a whole and the practitioner\nas a being forming a part of, and partaking in, the cosmos. The three\naspects interpenetrate to make-up the macrocosmos while in their\nnon-duality with cosmic constituents, they become manifest through\nsuccessful Shingon practice and in one\u2019s consequent\nenlightenment.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s elucidation of these three aspects provide both a\ntheoretical and a practical grounding for his own conception of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu or \u201cbecoming Buddha in this very\nembodied existence,\u201d by clarifying both its possibility and its\nmethod. Japanese commentators have often classified his thought along\nthe following lines: the theory of the six universal elements as\nproviding a metaphysic, the theory of the four mandalas as providing\nan epistemology, and the theory of the three mysteries as providing a\nmetapraxis. But one must also keep in mind that all three concerns\n\u2013 metaphysical, epistemological, and practical \u2013 are\nintertwined and inseparable in K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking.\nFurthermore all three involve the significance of the body so that\neven in his so-called \u201cepistemology,\u201d embodiment cannot be\nignored.\n\nIn the immediately following subsections I will briefly discuss each\nof these aspects before providing a more detailed exposition of them\nin the following sections.\n3.4.1 Somaticity (the six universal elements)\n\nHosshin in its somaticity is identified with the cosmos as an\norganic whole wherein thing-events come and go via\ninterdependent origination. The cosmos as such is called\nhokkai (Skrt: dharmadh\u0101tu; world/realm of the\nDharma), and in turn as the hosshin, it is the body\nor soma (tai) of the Buddha Dainichi. (However it\nshould not be understood as substantial in the western\nphilosophical sense because it is \u201cempty\u201d \u2013 more on\n\u201cemptiness\u201d below.) Hence K\u016bkai in\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi cites lines from the Avatamsaka\nS\u016btra that \u201call lands are in the body of the\nBuddha,\u201d or that \u201ceach hair [of the Buddha] contains\nmyriad lands as vast as oceans\u2026\u201d And yet simultaneously\nthe truth, the Dharma, embodied in the entire cosmos is manifest\nwithin each of its micro-cosmic parts. This view that the whole\npermeates its parts \u2013 reminding us perhaps of the more recent\ntheories of holonics or the holographic model of the universe \u2013\nallows K\u016bkai to show that the hosshin does indeed preach\nthe Dharma throughout the cosmos in its every single aspect.\n\nThis great cosmic body of the hosshin embraces all phenomena\nthrough the mutual \u201cnon-obstruction\u201d of the six universal\nelements (rokudai muge). (Mutual\n\u201cnon-obstruction\u201d or muge here must be understood\nto mean what allows for their interrelations and interpenetrations\nthat constitute things. In being non-substantial, they do not obstruct\neach other. And \u201cuniversal\u201d or dai here must be\nunderstood in its literal sense as \u201cgreat,\u201d meaning that\nit does not exclude any phenomena or thing-event in the cosmos at\nall.) As the cosmos, the hosshin is made up of the six\n\u201cgreat\u201d elements (fire, earth, water, air, space,\nconsciousness) which interrelate to constitute thing-events in their\ninterdependent origination. Their interaction thus constitutes the\nsomaticity of an ever-evolving whole. But as dependent origination\nequals emptiness (Skrt: \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101; Jpn:\nk\u016b) in Buddhism, this cosmic body is an embodiment of\nthe Dharma qua emptiness. Moreover emptiness also signifies\n\u201cspace,\u201d for the same graph (k\u016b) is used to\nmean \u201cemptiness\u201d and \u201cspace.\u201d Hence the cosmic\nbody in its endless vastness, as space embracing everything, can be\nseen as providing the space for the emergence of thing-events through\nthe intermingling of the six elements. Thus Dainichi\u2019s body as\nthe cosmic embodiment of the Dharma pervades all beings to\nmake up, through the six elements, each of their own bodies. And yet\nfrom another perspective, as the cosmic body is a vast emptiness that\nmakes room for the emergence of beings, each of these beings are in\nturn empty. For being and emptiness in the Buddhist understanding are\ntwo intertwining aspects of the same truth. (We shall discuss the more\nprecise sense of \u201cemptiness\u201d in the following sections.)\nSo the hosshin in its somaticity designates the ontological\nground of all beings but also designates their underlying\nde-ontologizing (or: me-ontologizing; or even better: anontological)\nemptiness, their non-substantiality.\n3.4.2 Form of appearance (the four mandalas)\n\nThe hosshin in its cosmic significance appears in the form or\nfigure (s\u014d) of a mandara (Skrt: mandala). That\nis, its cosmic body appears in a mandalic pattern, as represented in\nthe mandalas used in Shingon ritual. Correspondingly the mind of a\nsentient being is also supposed to take on the form of a mandala\nespecially as one advances in practice to realize non-duality with the\nmandalic hosshin. That is, the mind-and-body experience of\neach sentient being mirrors in its own way the mandalic pattern of the\ncosmos. As one becomes enlightened, one comes to realize this\ninter-mirroring. In the envisioning of reality as a mandala, the\npractitioner, who on the one hand is aiming for Buddhahood, is at\nthe same time also the Buddha existing in the mandalic reality\nand expressing itself in mandalic form. Whether seen as the form\nexperienced in the mind or as the form of the cosmos, the mandalic\nfigure is the Buddha\u2019s mode of expressing the Dharma. This\nmandalic appearance of the Buddha is categorized into four types,\nwhich we will discuss in a section below.\n3.4.3 Function (the three mysteries)\n\nThe function of the hosshin is equated with all movements and\nchange that occur in the cosmos. Such cosmic alterations are\ncategorized in three ways in terms of visible form (e.g., loco-motion\nor change of place, and trans-formation or change in shape), the\naudible (sound), and the mental (the thinking process). Visible\nalterations are movements of Dainichi\u2019s body (shin),\naudible alterations are movements of Dainichi\u2019s speech\n(ku), and mental alterations are movements of\nDainichi\u2019s thoughts (i). Together they are called the\n\u201cthree mysteries\u201d (Skrt: tri-guyha; Chn:\nsan-mi; Jpn: sanmitsu) making up the functions\n(y\u016b) of the hosshin. Since the body of Dainichi\nis the cosmos itself, these \u201cthree mysteries\u201d of its\nfunctions are at work in all thing-events and are ultimately\nnon-dualistic with the corresponding movements of ourselves.\n3.5 The Interpenetration of the Six Elements: The Embodiment of Emptiness as an Empty Body\n\nK\u016bkai (e.g. in his Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch.3)\ndiscusses Dainichi as a \u201cbody of the six great elements\u201d\n(rokudaishin, rokudai-taidai), which are the five\nuniversal material elements (godai) of earth, water, fire,\nwind/air, and space, representing the \u201cknown,\u201d plus the\nuniversal mental element (shindai) of consciousness,\nrepresenting the \u201cknower.\u201d Ultimately the five material\nelements make up the body of Dainichi and the sixth element designates\nthe mind of Dainichi. Their dynamic but harmonious interplay\nconstitute the \u201ctimeless yoga\u201d or samadhi (Jpn:\nj\u014d) of Dainichi\u2019s body-and-mind. But since\nDainichi is equated with the cosmos, all things comprising the whole\nworld are generated and perish through the interplay \u2013\n\u201cnon-obstruction\u201d and \u201cinterfusion\u201d \u2013 of\nthese elemental constituents. K\u016bkai then is definitely not an\nidealist taken in its western philosophical significance, and\nShingon thought in this aspect is distinct from the teachings of the\n\u201cmind-only\u201d (Yuishiki; Skrt:\nVij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101) school of Buddhism. For\nthe mental and the material, for K\u016bkai, are two non-dualistic\n(interpenetrating and mutually non-obstructing) aspects of the same\nDharma \u2013 as depicted in the two mandalic embodiments, which we\nshall discuss below. In other words K\u016bkai does not reduce reality\nto either mind or matter; his perspective is neither merely idealist\nnor merely materialist.\n\nThe interrelationship amongst the elements signifies their\nnon-substantiality, i.e. the fact that they are not ontologically\nindependent, and in Buddhist parlance this means\n\u201cemptiness\u201d (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101,\nk\u016b). Hence all elements and things they constitute,\nincluding the entire cosmos is empty. Dainichi\u2019s body, as the\nhosshin that embodies the Dharma, is an embodiment of\nemptiness, analogically understood as a vast empty space \u2013 it is\nin part analogical but also exemplary of emptiness. Rather than\nobstructing the emergence of things, this emptiness permits it through\ntheir interdependent origination, which is the meaning of emptiness.\nTheir materiality is then just as real as their emptiness, and\nemptiness and matter are non-dualistic. True to the \u201cmiddle\nway\u201d of Buddhism, K\u016bkai treads a path that avoids reifying\nsubstantialism on the one hand as well as utter nihilism on the other\nhand. And in the non-dualistic interrelationships between body and\nmind, matter and emptiness, known and knower, the Dharma itself, as\nthe truth of non-duality in interdependent origination qua\nemptiness is revealed in every physical and mental process of the\ncosmos as the embodiment of the Dharma.\n\nThe \u201chorizontal\u201d interpenetration between the elements,\ni.e., the interdependence and mutual non-obstruction amongst the\nimmanent phenomena of the cosmos, also translates into the\n\u201cvertical\u201d interpenetration between the whole and its\nparts, that is, between Dainichi as embodied in the cosmos and all\nthing-events within. The implications of such cosmic non-duality for\nthe practitioner is immensely significant. In non-duality with the\ncosmic Buddha, one\u2019s unenlightened self in both\nmind-and-body is thus an expression of the hosshin, an\nembodiment of the Dharma. That is, as one\u2019s mental states\nexpress the samadhi of Dainichi, so also one\u2019s body\nalong with the bodies of all living and non-living things, in every\nbodily movement, manifests Dainichi\u2019s body and its movements.\nDainichi is preaching the Dharma through all phenomena of the cosmos.\nBut as we ourselves are the bodies through which Dainichi preaches, we\nare enabled to realize the cosmic samadhi that our\nbodies-and-minds express. This points to the non-dualistic\nsignificance between the two exemplary concepts of Shingon Buddhism:\nhosshin sepp\u014d and sokushinj\u014dbutsu, both of\nwhich we shall examine in detail in the following sections.\n3.6 Hosshin Sepp\u014d: The Buddha\u2019s Cosmic Preaching of the Dharma\n\nAs the hosshin, the Buddha Dainichi preaches the Dharma\nvia his omnipresencing, that is, through every sensible media\nof the cosmos. K\u016bkai called this, hosshin sepp\u014d\n(literally: \u201cthe dharmak\u0101ya\u2019s expounding of\nthe Dharma\u201d), and used its concept (e.g. in his Benkenmitsu\nnikky\u014dron) as an important criterion for distinguishing\nesoteric Buddhism from exoteric Buddhism. In his work\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi, this concept of hosshin\nsepp\u014d serves as the starting point. The sepp\u014d\n(\u201cpreaching,\u201d \u201cexpounding\u201d) therein is equated\nwith the phenomena of the cosmos as comprising\nsh\u014djijiss\u014d, that is, sound, sign, reality, and\ntheir meanings. (We will discuss the linguistic or semiological\nsignificance of this idea in the following section.) The point is that\nevery thing and every event in the universe, as objects of our six\nsenses, are the Buddha\u2019s preaching of the Dharma. Each\nphenomenon manifest serves to explain (setsu) the truth, the\nDharma. The hosshin in its omnipresencing throughout the\ncosmos, permeating every aspect of it, is perpetually informing all\nthings of the Dharma. This cosmic omnipresencing of the Dharma via\nhosshin sepp\u014d entails a dynamism of continuous activity\nthat accounts for the movements within the universe \u2013 both\nphysical and mental.\n\nSince everything to which Dainichi preaches, is itself his\nmanifestation as an embodied part of the cosmos, the sermon is\nultimately a monologue. The expounding of the Dharma is in one sense\nthen really the Buddha\u2019s monologic expression of his own\nself-enjoyment in samadhic bliss. And yet simultaneously it\nexpresses Dainichi\u2019s compassion for the unawakened (though\nultimately they are non-dualistic with the Buddha) so that they may\nalso enjoy the fruits of the Dharma. Through the help of\nDainichi\u2019s compassionate con-descension or kaji (more\non this in a later section), the practitioner is enabled to\ninter-resonate with the sermon of the cosmos.\n\nThe idea of hosshin sepp\u014d also expresses a\nuniversalization in Shingon of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion\nof expedient (or: skillful) means. The Shingon doctrine of\nh\u014dben kuky\u014d (\u201cultimacy of expedient\nmeans\u201d) means that any phenomenon or thing-event of the cosmos\ncan serve as a means to enlightenment, entailing a gradation of\nunderstanding, hinging on how the event speaks to the person relative\nto the time, place, and situational context. This also corresponds to\nthe levels of mental states discussed in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nJ\u016bj\u016bshinron (which we will examine in a further\nsection below). The key to immediate and complete enlightenment\nhowever is to understand the comprehensive (or\nholistic) sense of the truth being spoken by the cosmos as a\nwhole even if through the medium of a particular thing-event.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s claim was that only through the Buddhism of\nesoteric teachings can one attain to an experiential recognition of\nhosshin sepp\u014d, i.e. that the cosmos itself is describing\nthe immediate enlightened body-and-mind state of the Buddha. By\ncontrast exoteric truths preached by other forms of Buddhism are meant\nfor a specific audience in a specific place and time, and hence are\nconditional, relative, and provisional. Moreover exoteric truths are\nlimited by human language, which is inadequate to describe the state\nof enlightenment and the absoluteness of the Dharma. The esoteric\ntruth revealed in hosshin sepp\u014d on the other hand\nunfolds through a non-human language, that is, a cosmic and esoteric\nlanguage originating in the hosshin itself. This is the\nlanguage of the mantra or in Japanese, shingon, literally\nmeaning \u201cthe word of truth,\u201d and from which\nK\u016bkai\u2019s brand of Buddhism derives its name. Mantra\n(shingon) is the language of the cosmos involving all mental\nand physical-sensible phenomena. The esoteric truths expressed in this\nmantric language of the Buddha/cosmos reveal themselves only in\naccordance with the reader\u2019s capacity to attune himself to, and\nread, this cosmic (con)text of the mantric universe.\n3.7 Mantra: Cosmic Sound and (Con)Text\n\nThe idea of the mantra, inherited from Indian Mantray\u0101na,\noccupies a significant position in K\u016bkai\u2019s philosophy,\nwhich he elucidates in each of his Sanbu-sho and\nsystematically and most comprehensively in his\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi. Mantras denote the reality of all\ndharmas (shoh\u014d) \u2013 the elemental\nconstituents of reality \u2013 as themselves signifying the Dharma\npreached by the hosshin. (In Buddhism, the term\ndharma (h\u014d) has many meanings, among which are\nthe significances of truth itself and the elemental constituents of\nreality. When speaking of truth in its absolute sense as preached by\nDainichi or as embodied in the dharmak\u0101ya\n(hosshin), I have been capitalizing Dharma, and when\nspeaking of the elements that constitute reality, I leave\ndharma uncapitalized.) It represents the primordial speech of\nthe Buddha Dainichi uttering and expositing the Dharma, taken in both\nits restricted human significance and its broader cosmic significance.\nThat is, Dainichi\u2019s sermon as a mantra in the broad sense means\nall phenomena in general as vibrations emanating from\nDainichi\u2019s eternal samadhi through the interplay of the\nelements via the three media of body, speech, and mind.\nAll objects of the six senses as based upon those three media\nof visible and tangible forms, audible sounds, and thoughts, embody\nmantras as syllables uttered by Dainichi. And in its narrower sense\nthe mantra takes the abbreviated verbal form of syllables written in\nthe esoteric s\u016btras and uttered in esoteric ritual practice by\nthe practitioner. That is, the mantras uttered by practitioners in\nritual practice are to be taken as focused condensations of those\ncosmic vibrations in a particular sound. They are condensed\nmanifestations of the content of Dainichi\u2019s sermon, namely the\ntruth of enlightenment, the Dharma.\n3.7.1 Sh\u014djijiss\u014d: sound, sign, reality\n\nIn the broader sense of mantra, the whole cosmos is a language or text\nthat must be \u201cread\u201d if one is to receive its meaning (the\nDharma). K\u016bkai expresses this in the term\nsh\u014djijiss\u014d. Sh\u014dji means\n\u201csound-and-sign.\u201d Sh\u014d (or:\ns\u014d), meaning \u201csound,\u201d is the breath of\nDainichi, the vibrations of the five material elements in their\nmutually non-obstructively colliding interplay that resonate sounds\nthrough the air. In the narrower sense, this would be the mantras\nvoiced in ritual. Ji, meaning \u201csign,\u201d\n\u201cword,\u201d \u201cletter,\u201d or\n\u201ccharacter/graph,\u201d is sound in its signifying character as\nnaming or meaning something. As letter, it also provides a\nmaterial base whereby the sign\u2019s distinction from other signs\nbecomes retained and fixed. For what makes something a sign signifying\na specific meaning rather than another is difference\n(shabetsu). Anything that manifests its distinction from\nothers in virtue of its pattern (mon) \u2013 the various\ncombinations of shape, color, and movement among visual objects\n\u2013 then, for K\u016bkai, is a sign or letter (ji).\nMarking distinct patterns (mon), such things are\n\u201ccharacters\u201d (monji;\n\u201cpattern-letter\u201d). In the broadest and cosmic sense then,\nall phenomena of the six senses (i.e., the five physical senses plus\nthe thinking mind) as constituted by the inter-vibrations of the five\nmaterial elements and via their mutual distinctions\n(shabetsu), serve as letters of the cosmic (con)text,\nultimately signifying the Dharma but in its different aspects. In its\nnarrower significance, however, ji would be the written\nSanskrit letters as saturated with that esoteric meaning of the\nDharma. Jiss\u014d, meaning \u201creality,\u201d is that\nwhich is named, intended, meant, as evoked by sho becoming\nji. The ultimate referent or meaning of the world as text is\nthe Dharma in the spontaneous playing of its embodiment, the\nhosshin. In turn the process of articulation of the Dharma by\nthe hosshin generates everything in the cosmos, including the\nmyriad beings, their various realms, and its various forms of\nembodiment such as the celestial buddhas and the historical human\nbuddha. It also generates human languages in general which are thus\nseen as manifestations of this cosmic articulation. The cosmos as such\nis a text articulating the Dharma within the empty space of the vast\nlimitless and formless body of the hosshin. The cosmos as\nmantra is hence hosshin sepp\u014d.\n\nFrom the mantric articulation of the Dharma emerge ten realms and\ntheir respective languages (of hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, animals,\nasuras, humans, celestial heaven dwellers,\n\u015br\u0101vakas, pratyeka-buddhas,\nbodhisattvas, and buddhas). Each realm as an articulation of\nthe Dharma, has its own \u201csounds-and-signs,\u201d i.e., its own\nlanguage, in accordance with a specific perspective corresponding to\nthe degree of enlightenment and illusion of its inhabitants. But only\nthe language of the highest, the most comprehensive realm, i.e., the\nrealm of the Buddha, is identified with the \u201ctrue word\u201d\n(shingon, mantra), designating the Dharma as it is.\nThe nine other languages are by contrast \u201cillusory words\u201d\n(m\u014dgo). And yet they nevertheless do express the Dharma,\neach from its own relative and limited perspective. In this restricted\nsense, they are all mantras as well. For they take part in the cosmic\ntext of the hosshin written in the same inter-referential\ninterrelationships obtaining in all thing-events via the\ninterplay of the same universal elements. The difference is that while\nthe other languages are not conscious of their source, the most\ncomprehensive language, the \u201csounds-and-signs\u201d of the\nBuddha-realm, entails self-awareness of its mysterious origin.\n3.7.2. The cosmic text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d\n\nThe text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d itself is taken by\nK\u016bkai to be a condensation in scriptural form of that cosmic text\nof the mantra, comprising of the most comprehensive language of the\nBuddha-realm. And that same mantric text is then further condensed\ninto each syllabic-root letter of the Sanskrit alphabet itself, which\nthus serves as a means for meditation. In K\u016bkai\u2019s scheme\n(set out in his Dainichiky\u014d kaidai), the true\noriginal text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d is the eternal Dharma\nitself as the cosmic (con)text or mantra and cosmic mandala, existing\npermanently and comprising the universe and all phenomena. Within the\nworld, an abridged translation appeared that supposedly consisted of\n20,000 volumes and was circulated in India but became lost. The\nversion K\u016bkai brought back from China is a much smaller one, but\nhis claim is that every word, character, stroke or dot, within it in\nits mantric nature encompasses countless meanings and truths. Thus\nwhile the most abbreviated text is implaced within the original cosmic\ntext, the entire content of the cosmic text is itself encapsulated\nwithin the characters of its abridgment representing a condensation.\nThis \u201cinter-textuality\u201d exemplifies the Hua-yen (Huayan;\nJpn: Kegon) sense of interpenetration whereby the entire whole is\ncontained within each part, but here this Hua-yen idea is translated\nin mantric terms. This same scheme used in explaining the\nDainichi-ky\u014d was used by K\u016bkai to explain the\nrelationship of the Kong\u014dch\u014dgy\u014d and other\nesoteric texts to the world as well.\n3.7.3 Non-origination (honpush\u014d), emptiness (k\u016b), and difference (shabetsu)\n\nWhat exactly is the Dharma, the truth that all languages and all texts\npoint to as their mysterious source? K\u016bkai explicates its\nsignificance qua emptiness in terms of \u201cprimal\nnon-origination\u201d (Skrt: \u0101dyanutp\u0101da; Jpn:\nhonpush\u014d). What K\u016bkai means by\n\u201cnon-origination\u201d is related to his understanding of the\nemptiness of things and the differential referentiality of signs. By\nincorporating the Mah\u0101y\u0101na thought of emptiness,\nK\u016bkai\u2019s linguistic ontology of the mantra proves to be\nsimultaneously a linguistic \u201can-ontology\u201d (or:\n\u201cmeontology\u201d) of sorts. Every phenomenon of the cosmos,\nbeing empty of substantiality, is what it is through its\ninterdependent origination (Skrt:\nprat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da; Jpn: engi). Likewise\neach signifying letter of the cosmic text is what it is not\nbecause of its own substantial identity but rather through its\ndifference from other signifying letters. Its identity is constituted\nnot on the basis of a self-same essence but rather in reference to,\nand difference from, others. Signification then for K\u016bkai is\nnothing but differentiation (shabetsu), which is another way\nof speaking of the non-substantiality, i.e., emptiness, of phenomena.\nEvery thing \u2013 rocks, mountains, ants, etc. \u2013 is what it is\nin mutual distinction with everything else. And this differentiation\noccurs via its implacement into a specific situation or\ncontext vis-\u00e0-vis other things in an endless chain of mutually\nreferring (and differing) correlative thing-events. In reference to\nothers and without substantial self-presence, each thing-event is\nhence empty. In this respect, every thing, as signifying letter, is an\nembodiment of emptiness. And as such a sign or letter manifesting\nemptiness and differential referentiality, each thing-event is thus a\nmantra, Dainichi\u2019s \u201cseal of wisdom of\ndifferentiation\u201d (shabetsu chiin). The cosmic text\nconstituted of mutually differing signs is then the empty place of\nempty things, and as such, the ultimate scripture of emptiness. The\nhosshin as the embodiment of this truth, the Dharma, is thus\nitself differentiation, emptiness.\n\nThe world emerges in the articulation of the Dharma through such\nmutual differentiations in pattern. From out of the sea of emptiness,\nthrough Dainich\u2019s articulation qua mutual interplay of\nthe five material elements, the cosmos is ordered into distinct and\ndiscrete things and events, and the hosshin transforms itself\ninto a legible \u2013 albeit ambiguous \u2013 cosmic (con)text. This\nlinguistic cosmogeny is simultaneously ontological and me-ontological.\nFor each thing as sign in differential reference to the rest of the\ncosmic text, mirrors the infinity of all the other mutually referring\nand mutually differing thing-events. In its own emptiness, each\nthing-letter mirrors the emptiness of the cosmos, i.e., the Dharma.\nThey are traces of the hosshin\u2019s omnipresencing\nnon-substantiality, emptiness as the \u201cprimal\nnon-originating\u201d source of these thing-events in their\nbeginningless and endless interrelations. K\u016bkai takes this\nlinguistic cosmo-genesis in emptiness via the\nhosshin\u2019s world-play, to be the meaning behind the\n\u201cplayful striding of great emptiness,\u201d mentioned in the\nDainichi-ky\u014d (T18:21a) and which he quotes in his\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi. Furthermore this cosmogeny that is an\narticulation of truth, the writing of the cosmic text, is open-ended\nand on-going, dynamically being continuously reworked. This accounts\nfor the ambiguity of the cosmic text and every sign within it.\n\nThe ambiguity of the mantric nature of the cosmos and of all\nthing-events is in the fact that they entail simultaneously both hope\nand difficulty for enlightenment. The language of the hosshin\nin the form of thing-events may either guide one to enlightenment or\ndeceive one into delusion. For in spite of their emptiness, their\ninterdependent origination, thing-events can be easily reified in\nlight of human desires. When this happens the cosmic text they\nconstitute is misread under the pretext that the world as such is\nnothing but a system of substantial things, and that any corresponding\nlanguage is nothing but a system of signs representing those\nsubstantial things. Through the reification of their being, their\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d emptiness is ignored. And\ncorrespondingly one becomes predisposed to cling to them and hence\nsuffer. But this lack of essential origins in each and every\nphenomenon, the absence of their first cause, simultaneously means\nthat we ourselves, all sentient beings, are endowed with the original\nenlightenment of the hosshin (hongaku hosshin).\nHence there is hope for the realization of this enlightenment\nfor all.\n3.7.4 Mantra intonation\n\nShingon ritual practice attempts to trigger this realization through\nthe mantric pronunciations of the five basic syllables of Sanskrit\n\u2013 A,Va, Ra, Ha,\nKha, (and sometimes adding a sixth syllable\nH\u016b\u1e43) \u2013, emulating the primordial utterance\nof Dainichi. This is to attune the practitioner to the inter-resonance\nof the basic elements underlying all phenomena, so that he may hear\nthe \u201ctrue words\u201d being preached by Dainichi. The\nmantra\u2019s power is in its incomprehensibility to human\nunderstanding. Its significance cannot be explained analytically or\nunderstood conceptually; it is instead to be experienced in ritual.\nThrough ritualized experience, these intellectually incomprehensible\nsounds, in the self-deconstruction of any assumed or projected\nmeaningfulness, paradoxically evoke the emptiness they mean and the\nemptiness of their meaning, the emptiness of all in their mutual\nnon-obstruction and interdependence. Its incomprehension makes\nexplicit the materiality and dynamic process involved behind the\nemergence of signs. This undermines any linguistic assumption of the\nsubstantiality of things and hence any delusory attachments to them.\nWhat is invoked is a paradigm shift from seeing the surface pattern of\nthings to seeing their underlying emptiness. (Abe 1999, 297\u201398)\nIn addition to mantric intonations, another form of practice was\na-ji meditation, wherein the written form of the Sanskrit\nletter A is treated as an object of meditation. The purpose\nof such concentrated attention on the material form of a sign is to\ngain some sort of an experiential comprehension of its esoteric\nsignificance, somewhat similar to that of mantra incantation as just\ndiscussed. However we must note the special significance of the\nparticular letter A, which we shall discuss below.\n3.7.5 The mantric syllable of A\n\nThe two most important mantric syllables from Sanskrit\n\u2013 in the Siddham (Jpn: shittan) script system\npopularized in East Asia \u2013 emphasized in Shingon Buddhism, in\nboth sound and graph, are A and Un\n(H\u016b\u1e43). The former is the seed-syllable of Dainichi\nas explicated in the Dainichi-ky\u014d and the latter is the\nseed-syllable of the Kong\u014d-satta (Vajrasattva, a\nbuddha-being believed to have received instruction directly from\nMah\u0101vairocana) as explicated in the\nKong\u014dch\u014d-gy\u014d, and together seen as\nnon-dualistic in significance. In the following I will discuss the\nsignificance of these seed-syllables.\n\nK\u016bkai in several works (especially in\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi and Unjigi) explicates the\nsyllabic letter A as signifying the above-mentioned\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d character of all thing-events, as\nthe \u201cmother\u201d of all syllables, letters, and languages, and\nthe king of all mantras. The sound A is also the primal sound\nmade when the mouth first opens to exhale. And in its written form,\nA constitutes the first stroke of every other syllable.\nA is the first syllable of the Sanskrit alphabet as well as\nof the Sanskrit words for \u201corigin\u201d (\u0101di) and\n\u201cunborn\u201d (anutp\u0101da), combined in the\nSanskrit word \u201cprimal non-origination\u201d\n(\u0101dyanutp\u0101da). It is also the first letter of the\nroot mantra of Dainichi as depicted in the Taiz\u014d Mandara (which\nwe shall discuss below): A Vi Ra H\u016b\u1e43 Kham\n(Jpn: A Bira Un Ken). Furthermore in\nSanskrit, A is used as a negative prefix. All of these\nmanifold meanings are combined in Shingon\u2019s mantric use\nof A to represent the primal vocalization of Dainichi. Its\nomnipresence in form and sound symbolizes the Buddha-nature of the\nhosshin pervading everywhere, while condensing the\nsignificance of that all-prevalence within its singular form and\nsound. But its all-pervasiveness also means the origin of all things\nin their interdependence, that is, their interdependent origination,\nhence emptiness. This emptiness of substance is denoted by its use as\na negative prefix, i.e., the absence of self-presence in infinite\nreferentiality. As stated above, A signifies the\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d character of all being. For in\nsignifying the origin of all in their on-going dependent origination\nA is thus the \u201corigin of no origin.\u201d What this\npoints to is the endlessness of the chain of conditions behind each\nthing-event, never reaching an ultimate origin or first cause. But\nparadoxically this primal absence of any distinguishing origin, this\nubiquitous in-difference of all differentiation, is itself the\nultimate origin of all thing-events in their mutual differentiations\nand co-relativity. Or put differently, Dainichi\u2019s mind (along\nwith his body), making no discrimination between this and that, is\nlike a great space (\u201cemptiness\u201d; k\u016b) from\nout of which he transforms himself through self-differentiation into\nthe myriad thing-events and beings. This causeless cause is symbolized\nin the last letter in Sanskrit, the letter H, the first\nletter of the mantra H\u016b\u1e43 (Jpn: Un). Its\nmeaning thus coincides with the \u201cprimal non-origination\u201d\ndenoted by the first letter of the alphabet, A. The syllable\nA, together with H then embodies the meanings of\nemptiness, dependent origination, and primal non-origination, all\nexpressing the beginningless and endless dynamic non-substantiality of\nthe entire cosmos and all being, the empty space that is the body of\nthe hosshin, the Dharma of all dharmas.\n\nIt should be remembered however that while K\u016bkai thus links the\nhosshin\u2019s preaching to the mantric sound and\nletter of A, this same preaching, symbolized in A,\nin fact encompasses all movements of the cosmos, involving colors,\nshapes, silence, bodily movements, etc., not just the explicitly\nvocal. Dainichi preaches the Dharma via all phenomenal means\nthrough the three media, the \u201cthree mysteries,\u201d of body,\nspeech, and mind, omnipresencing himself through all objects of the\nsix senses (the five physical senses plus thought). The entire cosmos\nis hence the language of the Buddha, inseparable from the\nBuddha\u2019s body that is in fact the embodiment of the Dharma\n(i.e., hosshin, dharmak\u0101ya). We now turn to the\nmandalic aspect of the embodiment of the Dharma and of\nDainichi\u2019s preaching of the Dharma.\n3.8 The Mandalic Cosmos/Cosmos as Mandala\n3.8.1 Rishin and chishin: Two mandalic embodiments\n\nViewed in light of the concept of hosshin sepp\u014d, the\ncosmos is a flowering of the Dharma preached by Dainichi, as it\nspreads outward towards beings receiving it in various degrees in\naccordance with their level of understanding. The form that this\nflowering takes is the mandala (Jpn: mandara). The mandala in\nShingon Buddhism is a diagram or picture, usually a painting,\npicturing the doctrines expounded in the two major esoteric\nscriptures, Dainichiky\u014d and\nKong\u014dch\u014dgy\u014d. It depicts visually the form that\nenlightenment takes as it becomes manifest in the universe. In other\nwords, it is taken to be a visual depiction of the hosshin\nitself and the flowering of hosshin sepp\u014d throughout the\ncosmos, serving as a map for one\u2019s journey to enlightenment.\n\nThis use and understanding of the mandala was another distinction of\nShingon Buddhism differentiating it in K\u016bkai\u2019s mind as\nesoteric from exoteric Buddhism. The mandala proves to be \u201ca\nmetaphor for a new envisioning of reality, self, and world\u201d\n(Gardiner 2008, 44), a vehicle for the transformation of vision,\nwhereby one envisions the world as a mandala.\nK\u016bkai\u2019s contention was that exoteric teachings move the\npractitioner towards the central summit of the mandala, step-by-step\nfrom its own specific vantage point without taking a comprehensive\nview of the whole. Esoteric teachings on the other hand take the\nentirety of the cosmic mandala into one comprehensive view, allowing\nfor the practitioner to leap, as it were, into the center to realize\nnon-duality with the hosshin.\n\nIn the esoteric tradition that K\u016bkai inherited from Hui-kuo,\nthere are two major mandalas that depict the hosshin in two\ndifferent mandalic forms. Each mandala originally belonged to one of\nthe two esoteric lineages, which became combined in China, and is\nassociated with either of the two s\u016btras. All Shingon doctrines,\ntraceable to the two s\u016btras, are supposed to be pictorially\ndepicted in these two mandalas: the Taiz\u014d (Skrt:\nGarbha, \u201cWomb of enlightenment\u201d) and the\nKong\u014dkai (Srkt: Vajradh\u0101tu,\n\u201cVajra realm,\u201d \u201cDiamond realm\u201d or\n\u201cRealm of the adamantine thunderbolt\u201d) mandalas. Together\nthey are called ry\u014dbu mandara and represent a\ncomprehensive unity. Each are also associated with one of the two\ndifferent concepts of ri (pattern, order \u2013 referring to\nemptiness as the reason discerned in patternment) and chi\n(wisdom, i.e., the wisdom of emptiness). Accordingly the\nhosshin can be understood in its embodied form as\nri-hosshin (or rishin) and as chi-hosshin\n(or chishin), two aspects which are ultimately non-dualistic\n(richi funi). The ri-hosshin is depicted in the\nTaiz\u014d mandara that expresses truths expounded in the\nDainichi-ky\u014d. And the chi-hosshin is depicted\nin the Kong\u014dkai mandara that expresses truths expounded in the\nKong\u014dch\u014d-gy\u014d. Both depict Dainichi as the\ncentral deity, with buddhas and bodhisattvas surrounding him in\ngeometric arrangement.\n\nThe Taiz\u014d-mandara (full name: Daichitaiz\u014dsei\nmandara; Skrt: Garbhako\u015badh\u0101tu mandala;\n\u201cGreat compassion womb repository birth mandala\u201d)\nrepresents the \u201cfemale principle\u201d and expresses the\nmaterial world in its underlying empatternment of ri, which\nis the Buddha\u2019s view to truth from the summit of enlightenment\ndownward to the mundane world of humans. Ri (Chn:\nli) often translated into English as \u201cprinciple,\u201d\nin fact has the sense of \u201cpattern,\u201d and in the esoteric\nBuddhist context signifies the pattern found in the interplay of the\nfive material elements that constitute the myriad thing-events and\nphenomena. As the material elements form the objects of cognition, the\nmandala depicting the rishin represents the known. In his\ncommentary on the Dainichi-ky\u014d\n(Dainichi-ky\u014d kaidai), K\u016bkai equates the\nnature of Dainichi taken as jish\u014d hosshin with this\nrishin. He then in turn identifies the rishin as the\noriginal enlightenment intrinsic to all sentient beings but hidden in\nits unmanifest potentiality as what is to be known. \n\nAs a descending view from the summit, this Taiz\u014d mandala\nrepresents the enlightened universe from the perspective of\ncompassion, an expression of the \u201cfemale\u201d principle. Just\nas a mother enfolds her child in the care of her womb, the\nBuddha\u2019s compassion nurtures the original enlightenment in all.\nWith the lotus as chief symbol, the picture represents the\nmanifestation of Dainichi through his cosmic activities. Dainichi\noccupies the unmoving center with myriad buddhas, bodhisattvas, and\nother deities layered around it, while Dainichi simultaneously\npervades all up to the outermost edges of the diagram. From that\ncenter, enlightenment radiates outward in a spiral, passing through\nthe various buddhas and bodhisattvas, descending through various\nlevels of being and mind, outward to the phenomenal world as it\nbecomes more and more concrete, reaching the human world and further\ninto the realms of animals, hell-beings, and hungry ghosts. Thus a\nwellspring of activity is depicted to be endlessly flowing out of the\ncenter. This activity manifests the welling-up of compassion from the\nBuddha\u2019s wisdom as it moves outwards and downwards.\nSimultaneously all beings are directed inwards and upwards towards\nenlightenment depicted in the mandalic center. The two movements are\nnon-dualistic.\n\nThe Kong\u014d-kai mandara (Srkt: Vajradh\u0101tu\nmandala; \u201cVajra-realm mandala\u201d) represents\nthe \u201cmale priciple\u201d and embodies the\nvajra-wisdom, a wisdom that is adamantine and imperishable\nand that illuminates and enfolds all beings. This symbolizes the sixth\nelement, the mental element of chi (wisdom), referring to the\nmental realm of the knower, the subject of cognitive experience. But\nit also represents the Buddha\u2019s adamantine power of illumination\nthat realizes enlightenment, symbolized by the vajra (an\nadamantine weapon with many points). In this respect the mind it\nsymbolizes is not only the practitioner\u2019s mind but also the\nall-comprehensive mind of Dainichi as indestructible potentials of the\ncosmos, as the Buddha\u2019s \u201cembodiment of wisdom\u201d\n(chishin). \n\nThis Kong\u014d-kai mandala is a rectangle consisting of a\ncombination of nine smaller mandalas, each an originally independent\nmandala, juxtaposed to depict a double spiraling movement, centrifugal\nand centripetal: on the one hand outward of the Buddha\u2019s\nenlightenment towards the phenomenal world, and on the other hand\ninward of beings on the periphery from the mundane world in spiritual\nprogression towards enlightenment at the center. Of the nine smaller\nmandalas, the most basic, which are on the lower left corner, are\nrepresentations of the so-called \u201cfour mandalas\u201d\n(shimandara) that K\u016bkai classified as the form of\nappearance of the hosshin. (More on the shimandara\nin the next section.) All together the nine depict the unending\nactivity of the enlightened mind, moving clockwise from the center, to\ntake on increasingly concrete forms, engaging in skillful means to\nhelp the unenlightened, while the unenlightened evolve towards the\ncenter. From the Buddha\u2019s perspective, the center is moving\noutwards; and from the individual practitioner\u2019s perspective,\nthe periphery is being drawn inwards. Enlightened wisdom cannot remain\naloof from the realities of unenlightened life. Skillful means thus\nembodies wisdom in concrete phenomenal activity. In this respect, the\nmandala emphasizes the non-duality between wisdom (hannya)\nand skillful means. And it symbolizes the wisdom that knows truth, the\nDharma, in all its separate manifestations.\n\nTogether these two mandalic forms depict the form of the cosmos as a\ndynamic process interrelating and uniting the transcendent and the\nmundane, the enlightened and the ignorant, Buddha and man, macrocosmos\nand microcosmos, matter and mind, pattern and wisdom. They visually\nrepresent two simultaneous overlapping aspects of enlightenment,\nvariously described as emptiness and form, compassion and wisdom,\nobject and subject, the dimension from which the practitioner\nis guided by the Buddha and the dimension towards which the\npractitioner evolves. In K\u016bkai\u2019s reading, these are\ninseparable aspects of the hosshin, depicted in the two\nmandalas from different but non-dualistic perspectives. Enlightenment\nwould be the experiential realization of their non-duality: richi\nfuni. In Shingon practice, therefore the Taiz\u014d mandala\n(rishin) is hung on the east wall of the meditation hall; and\nthe Kong\u014dkai mandala (chishin) is hung on the west\nwall.\n3.8.2 The four types of the mandala\n\nIn addition to the two mandalic embodiments of the hosshin,\nK\u016bkai (in Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch.4) classifies\nmandalas in general into four types, depicting the different ways\nwhereby the Dharma is manifest: 1. The \u201cgreat mandala\u201d\n(Skrt: mah\u0101-mandala; Jpn: daimandara)\nsymbolizes the cosmic Buddha in its physical extension along with all\nthe stages of being, including the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deities\nthat are depicted in perfect anthropormophic form surrounding Dainichi\nat the center and painted in different colors to represent different\nmaterial elements. 2. The \u201csamaya mandala\u201d (Skrt:\nsamaya-mandala; Jpn: sanmaya mandara) pictures the\nBuddha-cum-universe through a variety of articles or signs,\nsymbolizing the omnipresencing of Dainichi\u2019s intention (Skrt:\nsamaya; Jpn: sanmaya). They include swords, gems,\nlotus, vajra, etc., as each signifying a specific improvisation of a\nskillful mean to enlighten the unenlightened. This also represents the\nunity-in-diversity of all thing-events as forms of Dainichi\u2019s\nbody. 3. The \u201cDharma mandala\u201d (Skrt:\nDharma-mandala; Jpn: h\u014d mandara) pictures the\nuniverse as the sphere of Dainichi\u2019s continuous communication of\ntruth (Dharma), as depicted in the arrangement of mantric\nseed syllables. And 4. The \u201ckarma mandala\u201d (Skrt:\nkarma-mandala; Jpn: katsuma mandara) was originally\na three-dimensional mandala in sculpted form \u2013 including the\nphysical layout of the temple compound at Mt. K\u014dya \u2013 but\nwhich more often became a painted one instead. Showing the activities\n(karma) of buddhas and bodhisattvas implied in the other\nthree, this mandala depicts the fact that every change in any form\nwithin the cosmos is an act of the hosshin and conversely\nthat every act of the hosshin is an occurrence of things and\nevents in the cosmos. The four then depict four different aspects of\ntruth: body (the five material elements), mind (intention, compassion,\nthe sixth element), speech (communication), and action (all\nmovements). Through meditation upon them one comes to view everything\nas a mandala, the cosmos as a mandalic unfolding of the Dharma.\nUltimately the mandala depicts not only the cosmos or the Dharma as\nobject but also one\u2019s own interior self in meditation as one\ninteriorizes it or as one visualizes it within.\n3.9 Sokushinj\u014dbutsu: Enlightenment via Embodiment\n\nOne of the most distinguishing characteristic of K\u016bkai\u2019s\nBuddhist thought is his concept of sokushinj\u014dbutsu, the\nattainment of enlightenment in this very embodied existence. This idea\nof sokushinj\u014dbutsu represents the apex of\nK\u016bkai\u2019s synthesis of Buddhist theoria and\npraxis. The doctrine itself is not explicit in the two major\nesoteric s\u016btras, the Dainichiky\u014d and the\nKong\u014dch\u014dgy\u014d. The idea first appears rather in\nI-hsing\u2019s commentary on the Dainichiky\u014d\n(Ta-jih Ching Su; Commentary on the Mah\u0101vairocana\nS\u016btra). K\u016bkai was the first however to provide the idea\nwith a systematic explication in his Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi,\nwhich has been regarded by commentators as the most important of his\nphilosophical expositions. K\u016bkai\u2019s appropriation and\nsystematic development of the theory takes the form of a unique\nphilosophy of praxis that is simultaneously a philosophy of\nthe body.\n\nThe phrase sokushinj\u014dbutsu means literally,\n\u201cattaining enlightenment in this very body\u201d or\n\u201cbecoming buddha in this very body.\u201d \u201cBody\u201d\n(shin) \u2013 as K\u016bkai explains in\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch. 6 \u2013 here is not merely\none\u2019s corporeal body but one\u2019s lived embodied existence of\nbody-and-mind as one whole. In addition \u201cbody\u201d here takes\non myriad significances when one views sokushinj\u014dbutsu\nin light of K\u016bkai\u2019s other concepts such as hosshin\nsepp\u014d and sanmitsu. Sokushin (\u201cthis\nbody\u201d), for example, can signify the cosmos of the\nhokkai as the macrocosmic body of the hosshin with\nwhich one\u2019s own embodiment is non-dualistic. It can mean each of\nthe six universal elements or all of them together that comprise the\ncosmic body and its samadhi. It can also mean the four\nembodiments of the hosshin. It can mean the bodies of all\nliving things other than one\u2019s self. In correspondence with the\n\u201cthree mysteries\u201d of body, speech, and mind, or\nmudra, mantra, and mandala, it can mean bodily gestural\nsymbols (in), figures of letters (ji), and\nexpressive demeanor or countenance (g\u014d). All of these\nsenses of \u201cbody\u201d are interrelated and inseparable,\nmutually mirroring one another.\n\nShingon has inherited much of the metaphysics of Chinese\nMah\u0101y\u0101na thought: e.g., the equation of hosshin and\nhokkai, traceable to Hua-yen Buddhism; and the equation of\nthe hosshin with the universal Buddha-nature inherent in all\nbeings as their \u201coriginal enlightenment\u201d, traceable to\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai (Tiantai; Jpn: Tendai) Buddhism. Combining\nthese Mah\u0101y\u0101na equations, in Shingon, the embodiment of the\nDharma equals the cosmos as the realm of truth, the Dharma, which in\nturn means the inherent universal original enlightenment (honnu\nhongaku) in all beings. But what distinguishes K\u016bkai\u2019s\nthought is in his focus upon the body and its concrete practice. The\ncosmos is the \u201cbody of truth\u201d and our own bodies take part\nin that cosmic body. It is this bodily aspect, as a universal medium\nor plenum that allows for the concretization of universal\nenlightenment to be realized through ritualized bodily experience.\nBoth Hua-yen and T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai had similar notions of\nuniversal original enlightenment although that idea was quite new to\nJapan at the time. But what they lacked was any concrete ritual means\nfor realizing that enlightenment aside from basic meditation.\nK\u016bkai contended that their teachings were thus lacking in the\narea of practice. His emphasis upon a bodily ritual praxis\nthat cohered with scriptural doctrine provided them with\nsoteriological \u2013 rather than just magico-secular \u2013\nsignificance. This helped to bridge the gap between theory and\npractice, doctrine and ritual, that was previously left unexplained by\nthe orthodox Nara schools of Buddhism. As a consequence of his\nexplication of sokushinj\u014dbutsu, K\u016bkai thus provided\nboth a coherent explanation of the relationship between\ntheory and practice, and a concrete method for realizing\nthrough bodily experience those teachings, a practical method for\nrealizing what Mah\u0101y\u0101na already taught in China as\nhongaku.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s claim was that this esoteric method of\nritual-bodily-meditational practice \u2013 involving the three media\n(or \u201cmysteries\u201d) of body, speech, and mind \u2013 will\nallow one to realize one\u2019s direct embodied participation in the\nDharmic samadhi of the hosshin, i.e.,\n\u201cenlightenment in this very embodied existence\u201d\n(sokushinj\u014dbutsu). The lack of any systematic esoteric\nritual practice in exoteric Buddhism \u2013 from K\u016bkai\u2019s\nperspective, their rituals were unsystematized, haphazard \u2013,\nfails to lead to immediate enlightenment. Moreover the orthodox\nteaching of the exoteric schools was that it would take innumerable\nrebirths of training until one could attain Buddhahood. K\u016bkai\ninstead claimed that esoteric Buddhism, with its rituals and\nmeditational methods, can lead one, regardless of karmic\ndispositions, to instant enlightenment \u201cin this very\nbody.\u201d Through yogic and mantric practices\ninvolving the body, the practitioner was to eliminate all attachments\nto the substantiality of self and of things and to their\ndichotomization \u2013 this for the sake of immediately realizing\nnon-duality with the hosshin. In this way the idea of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu is put forth as a major distinguishing\ncharacteristic of esoteric from exoteric Buddhism, demonstrating the\npossibility of attaining enlightenment in one\u2019s\npresently embodied existence in distinction from the long and\ngradual process over countless aeons of rebirths as taught by the\nexoteric schools.\n\nFor K\u016bkai this bodily and concrete nature of the realization of\noriginal enlightenment, which he so emphasized, is ultimately\npredicated upon the fact that one\u2019s self and Buddha are\nnon-dualistic, that man in his very embodied existence \u2013 that\nis, in body-and-mind \u2013 is already a micro-cosmic mirror of the\nhosshin. We next turn to this aspect of man\u2019s mirroring\nof the Buddha, which simultaneously is also the Buddha\u2019s\nsalvific helping of man.\n3.10 Kaji: Macro-Micro-Cosmic Co-Respondence\n\nThe realization of enlightenment cannot be attained on one\u2019s\nown. For one is not a substantial, i.e., ontologically independent,\nbeing to begin with. As the cosmos itself is a web of interdependently\noriginating thing-events, nothing can stand alone to claim complete\nself-sufficiency. The same interdependency that obtains horizontally\nbetween the constituents of the cosmos also obtains vertically. That\nis, the whole is what it is in virtue of its parts just as the parts\nare what they are in partaking of the whole. The realization of\nenlightenment then as an event, as well as the relative degrees of\nspiritual development, entails a micro-cosmic and macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity. This is expressed in Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi,\nch. 5, in K\u016bkai\u2019s notion of kaji (Skrt:\nadhisth\u0101na), which has been variously translated as\n\u201cempowerment\u201d or \u201cgrace.\u201d In religious (or\ndevotional) terms, this is explained to involve both the\nBuddha\u2019s great compassion and the practitioner\u2019s piety,\ndevotion, or faith, which in their correspondence, act together in the\nattainment of enlightenment. But one must keep in mind that\nkaji in itself is not necessarilly enlightenment because the\nempowerment is in proportion to the level of spirituality attained by\nthe practitioner. Through such mutuality, one\u2019s own effort\npartakes in the omnipresencing of the hosshin, realized in\nvarious degrees. This mutuality is expressed in the meanings\nof the two characters that make up kaji: Ka,\nliterally meaning \u201cadding\u201d or \u201cincreasing,\u201d is\nexplained to be the Buddha\u2019s compassion that pours down upon,\nentering into, the practitioner\u2019s mind (shin) like\nsunrays on water. And ji, literally meaning\n\u201cretaining\u201d or \u201cholding,\u201d is explained to\nrefer to the practitioner\u2019s mind that keeps a-hold of, absorbs,\nthe compassion just as water retains and reflects the sunlight.\nKa is the gift that Dainichi gives; and\nji is our acknowledgment of that gift by cherishing\nit. Practically speaking this becomes expressed in the bodily ritual\ntraining that the practitioners undergo as they strive to ascend\n\u201cupwards,\u201d to meet Dainichi\u2019s compassionate descent\n\u201cdownwards.\u201d In the terminology that becomes later\npopularized with Pure Land Buddhism, this would signify a mutuality\nand non-duality between self-power (jiriki) and other-power\n(tariki). The two movements are aspects of a single movement\nof enlightenment. In other words, one\u2019s own striving is\nthe \u201cgrace\u201d of the Buddha helping one towards\nenlightenment. But this cannot simply be construed to mean one\u2019s\nreliance upon other-power but entails that one must appropriate that\n\u201cgrace\u201d in self-power. This mutuality of kaji is\nalso expressed in K\u016bkai\u2019s phrase, ny\u016bga\ngany\u016b (\u201c[Buddha] entering into me, and I entering\n[into Buddha]\u201d).\n\nKaji is realized as one becomes aware of one\u2019s self and\nactivity as the micro-cosmic manifestation of the macro-cosmic\nactivity and mystery of the cosmos itself. One could then also say\nthat kaji expresses the mutuality and coherence or\nco-responding that obtains between the two major concepts\ncharacterizing esoteric Buddhism for K\u016bkai: hosshin\nsepp\u014d and sokushinj\u014dbutsu, as two ways of\nconceiving from different angles the same interrelationality of the\ncosmos in its mantric and mandalic expressions. That is to\nsay, in the mantric and mandalic nature of this\ninterrelationality, the Buddha\u2019s hosshin sepp\u014d on\nthe one hand descends from the summit and spreads-out from the center,\nand the practitioner\u2019s sokushinj\u014dbutsu on the\nother hand raises him from below and gravitates him to the center.\nTheir simultaneity means their non-duality as different aspects of the\nsame dynamism of a cosmic emptiness. To realize this, is to affirm\none\u2019s own original enlightenment in one\u2019s present body in\nsimultaneous reception of Dainichi\u2019s expounding of the\nDharma.\n3.11 Sanmitsu: The Three Mysteries\n\nThe \u201ctrue words\u201d (mantra) preached by Dainichi,\nas we have already seen, are equated with the dynamism of the cosmos\nitself, which includes our own mental and bodily experiences. The\nBuddha\u2019s preaching through every phenomenon is classified by\nK\u016bkai in terms of the three forms of bodily, verbal, and mental\nactivities, or the three media of mudra (ingei),\nmantra, and mandala, i.e., Dainichi\u2019s cosmic gestural language,\nphonic language, and imaging language. Dainichi expresses the\nself-enjoyment of his enlightenment in these three functions of bodily\ngestures (mudras), the intoning of sounds (mantras), and\nvisualizing-thinking (mandalas). Since the cosmos is Dainichi\u2019s\nbody-and-mind, his deeds, words, and thoughts (or visualizations) form\nthe configurations, resonances, and patterns of the universe, in these\nthree media of \u201cbody, speech, and mind,\u201d called the\n\u201cthree mysteries.\u201d All visible and/or tangible forms and\nmovements constitute the Buddha\u2019s body and its movements, all\nsounds are his voice, and the mind\u2019s comprehension of this\nprinciple is the manifestation of the Dharma in mandalic form\nexpressing the Buddha\u2019s state-of-mind. That is, all objects of\nthe six senses make up the configurations, resonances, and patterns of\nthe cosmos, the cosmic body-and-mind of the Buddha Dainichi,\ncommunicating the Dharma. As K\u016bkai explains in his\nUnjigi, the three mysteries are in every single phenomenon,\npassing through all stages of being without discrimination, including\nstones, plants, trees, animals, humans, gods, demons, and places. Each\nof these serves as a \u201clinguistic\u201d medium that communicates\nDainichi\u2019s sermon in his omnipresencing, a sermon of the Dharma\nwhich cannot be expressed or described by means of the mundane human\nlanguages.\n\nAs these three media are in fact different expressions of the same\nDharma, they are not independent of each other. For example, the\nmantra is an expression of the mandala in sound, and conversely, the\nmandala conveys in pictures what the mantra intones. Together they\nconvey in visual form and in audible sound, the meaning of the Dharma.\nThrough these three media, sentient beings are thus aroused from their\nignorance to realize their own enlightenment.\n\nImplaced within this vibrating cosmos, we are all then taking part in\nDainichi\u2019s bodily, verbal, and mental activities as\n\u201coriginally enlightened,\u201d non-dualistic with the Buddha.\nOn the basis of kaji, which we discussed above, the three\nmysteries of the hosshin and the three corresponding forms of\nactivities of sentient beings inter-permeate. That is, our own bodily,\nverbal, and mental activities are already expressions of the three\nmysteries of the hosshin. This inter-permeation is hence\n\u201calways already,\u201d and yet what is lacking for the most\npart is our awareness of it that would realize it. That is why\nK\u016bkai, following the Dainichiky\u014d, prescribes the\nritual practice of bodily acts, verbal acts, and mental acts. Bodily\nacts involve mudra-formations \u2013 these are complex\nseries of gestural movements of the hands and fingers in coordination\nwith mantra-chanting and visualizations \u2013, meditative bodily\npostures, and the handling of ritual instruments. Verbal acts involve\nmantra-recitations and other forms of prayer formulas or chants and\nverses (dh\u0101ran\u012bs). And mental acts involve\nvisualizing or focussing upon mandalas or the figures of Sanskrit\nmantra letters as well as visualizations (kans\u014d,\nkannen) of deities or buddhas \u2013 a realization of self\nand world in the sense of both transformation and\nawakening as their fruit. Together with ingei\n(mudra) and shingon (mantra), the\npractitioner\u2019s kans\u014d allows the mandalic structure\ninseparable from the insight attained in such practice \u2013 an\n\u201cimage\u201d that in itself is visually unrepresentable and\nhence irreducible to the visual mandalic icon \u2013 to unfold. The\nthree acts are performed simultaneously in a practice wherein the\npractitioner utters a mantra, forms mudras, and visualizes\ntheir form and meditates their meaning and lets his mind abide in\nsamadhi, all at the same time. \n\nThe point of Shingon practice is to intentionally accord with, or\ninter-resonate with, Dainichi\u2019s movements, mirroring the\nmacrocosmic world in one\u2019s own microcosm. Thereby original\nenlightenment is realized in one\u2019s very own embodied dynamism of\nbodily, verbal, and mental acts. Shingon ritual meditative practice,\nas such, involving all three activities is meant to intentionally\nexpress the realization of one\u2019s participation in the cosmic\nmantra language of the hosshin. This practice then provides\nthe means of penetrating Dainichi\u2019s cosmic mantric language so\nthat one may directly comprehend and experientially verify hosshin\nsepp\u014d. By making use of all of the faculties of one\u2019s\nembodied existence \u2013 thinking, feeling, sensing, acting,\nvisualizing, etc. \u2013, one is led via kaji to comprehend\nthe Dharma, not merely conceptually or intellectually but through\none\u2019s body-and-mind. In non-duality with the Buddha\u2019s\ncosmic embodiment, one\u2019s own three human activities (Srkt:\ntrikarma; Jpn: sang\u014d) \u2013 bodily, verbal,\nand mental \u2013 immediately become experienced as the\nBuddha\u2019s own acts, the three cosmic mysteries, as immanent to\none\u2019s self. Thereby one is now intentionally participating in\nthe yoga or samadhi of Dainichi, thus realizing\none\u2019s own original enlightenment. In this state called\n\u201csecret\u201d or \u201cmysterious samadhi\u201d\n(himitsu sanmaji) or \u201csecret meditation\u201d\n(himitsu zen), with the help of kaji, the\nintegration between man\u2019s \u201cthree acts\u201d and\nBuddha\u2019s \u201cthree mysteries\u201d is realized, and Buddha\n\u201centers me and I enter\u201d Buddha. As one\u2019s mind thus\nbecomes enlightened and one\u2019s body becomes\n\u201cadamantine,\u201d one attains Buddhahood. (See\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch.5) In bodily-mental co-respondence\nwith the hosshin\u2019s omnipresencing via the\nthree mysteries, K\u016bkai claims, the non-duality between self and\nBuddha is thus realized immediately in one\u2019s embodied existence,\nthus sokushinj\u014dbutsu.\n\nWith successful completion, this practice of the three mysteries,\nwhich initially has the aspect of \u201cwith form\u201d\n(us\u014d) \u2013 that is, in rituals \u2013, comes to\noccur naturally, no longer restricted to its ritualized context. That\nis, the individual\u2019s every action in daily life, without ritual\nform (mus\u014d), comes to intentionally reflect the\nenlightened body-and-mind of the Buddha and its three mysteries. Every\nword uttered is thus a mantra, every bodily movement a mudra,\nand every thought samadhi. It is in this culmination of\nbodily practice, that all of K\u016bkai\u2019s major concepts,\nhosshin sepp\u014d, hongaku, sanmitsu,\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu, ny\u016bga gany\u016b,\nconverge in the attainment of Buddhahood. While from the Shingon\nesoteric perspective, this attainment is instant, from another\nperspective, viewed in light of all other (i.e., exoteric) doctrines,\nthe attainment is gradual and relative. We now turn to this final\ntopic in our discussion of K\u016bkai, the development of the mind\nthrough ten states from the animal to the enlightened.\n3.12 Ten States in the Development of the Mind\n\nBy 830 K\u016bkai has shifted his interest from an earlier focus upon\nthe controversy between Madhaymaka and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra concerning\nthe emptiness or existence of the dharmas and his critique of their\nview on language as not conveying truth (the Dharma), to evaluating\nBuddhist doctrines as a whole, including the other major Buddhist\nschools. This shift is most likely connected to the dispute on-going\nduring that period between the founder of the Tendai school,\nSaich\u014d, and the older Nara Buddhist schools. In providing a\ncomprehensive scheme that would explain the place of each religious\nteaching as well as the place of esoteric Buddhism in relation to the\nother Buddhist doctrines, K\u016bkai aimed to demonstrate the\nsignificance of his version of Buddhism.\n\nIn this scheme, K\u016bkai is adamant in using the above-discussed\nconcepts to distinguish esoteric from exoteric Buddhism. And yet,\ngiven a bird\u2019s eye view, the truth, the Dharma, in\nK\u016bkai\u2019s scheme is encompassing enough to include exoteric\nBuddhism and all other teachings as its unfoldings or manifestations,\nin relative degrees in accordance with the appropriate circumstance or\ncontext and the level of attainment. In order to explain the different\nlevels or states (j\u016b, literally \u201cdwellings\u201d\nor \u201clodgings\u201d) of mind (j\u016bj\u016bshin) that\ncorrespond to the various doctrines of other schools and religious\nsects, K\u016bkai developed an hierarchical scheme. Shingon Buddhism\nis placed at the top of the hierarchy as providing the most\ncomprehensive view to the Dharma. K\u016bkai provides this\nsystematization in what many consider to be his magnum opus,\nHimitsu mandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron (Treatise on the\nSecret Mandala of the Ten States of Mind) in ten volumes,\ncomposed around 830, five years before his death. It was written in\nresponse to an order of Emperor Junna that each Buddhist sect present\nan introductory treatise of its teachings. When the text proved to be\ntoo difficult for the emperor, K\u016bkai produced an abridged and\nmore accessible treatise on the same theme, Hiz\u014d\nh\u014dyaku (Precious Key to the Secret Treasury) in\nthree volumes. At the core of both works is this classification of the\nvarious doctrines whereby each is critically evaluated under the light\nof the culminating and most comprehensive view of Shingon. A similar\nsort of system of classifying doctrines, called\np\u2019an-chiao (panjiao) or chiao-pan\n(jiaoban) (Jpn: ky\u014ds\u014d hanjaku or\nky\u014d-han) already existed in China, e.g. within the\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and the Hua-yen traditions. Such a system of\nclassification proved helpful in their attempts to distinguish\nthemselves from, and at the same time, incorporate previous doctrines\nas expedient means that are relatively true. The Lotus\nS\u016btra had also already expressed the similar idea that\nvarious doctrines were meant as expedient means that lead eventually\nto a fuller truth (expressed within its own text). It is\nK\u016bkai\u2019s own invention however to associate the different\ndoctrines evaluated and classified with specific states of mind or\nstages of spiritual attainment. That is, each state in the development\nof the mind is correlated with a specific set of doctrines appropriate\nto it, as its perspective and lived experience of reality, true to a\ncertain extent within its limited purview but not yet the whole truth\nuntil the final state is reached. In other words, to move up this\nhierarchy of levels of mind, is to experience the unfolding of the\nDharma as one becomes further awakened until one fully realizes\none\u2019s enlightenment in non-duality with the Dharma itself, i.e.\nthe attainment of Buddha-hood. From a mandalic perspective, this\nunfolding of the Dharma is also indicative of one\u2019s evolution\nfrom the periphery towards the center of the mandalic universe.\nHowever as each level of mind is a \u201cdwelling\u201d or\n\u201clodging\u201d place for the mind, the hierarchy from the\nlowest to the highest \u201cstages\u201d is sequential only in the\nexoteric dimension. That is to say that the sequential ordering is not\nnecessary in itself when viewed from the esoteric, i.e., holistic,\nstandpoint. In other words, it is possible to move directly from any\nstate or \u201cdwelling\u201d to the most comprehensive realm.\n\nThe teachings evaluated here not only include Buddhist schools but\nalso variations of Brahmanism, Hinduism, and Indian religious\npractices as well as Chinese non-Buddhist doctrines. And the Buddhist\nteachings include the major Indian and Chinese doctrines that have\nmade their way to Japan: Ritsu (Chn. Lu-tsung, Vinaya studies), Kusha\n(based on Abhidharma), J\u014djitsu (Skrt. Satyasiddhi, based on\nSautr\u0101ntika), Hoss\u014d (Skrt. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Chn.\nFa-hsiang), Sanron (Chn. San-lun based on Indian Madhyamaka), Tendai\n(Ch. T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai), Kegon (Chn. Hua-yen), and Shingon.\nK\u016bkai\u2019s classification system may be briefly summarized in\nthe following schema:\n\n1st to 3rd states: Pre-Buddhist stages: worldly\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of samsaric entrapment:\n\n1st state: \u201cThe mind of the goat foolishly\ntransmigrating in the six destinies (or realms)\u201d (ish\u014d\nteiy\u014d-shin): The state of desire driven by animal instincts\nwithout moral restraint; the stage to which belong common people,\nhell-beings, hungry-ghosts, beasts, asuras\n(\u201ctitans\u201d), and various deities or celestial beings\ntrapped in their samsaric destinies.\n\n2nd state: \u201cThe mind of the child tempered but\nignorantly obsessed with moral precepts\u201d (gud\u014d\njisai-shin): The state of ethical actions and virtue that promote\nsocial order but without any \u201creligious\u201d goal; the stage\nto which belong Confucianism and the Buddhist precepts\n(ritsu) for the laity.\n\n3rd state: \u201cThe mind of the child composed and\nfearing nothing\u201d (yod\u014d mui-shin): The state of\ndeity worship and extrinsic magico-religious practice for the sake of\novercoming anxiety with the thought of attaining supernatural powers\nor immortality, or reaching an eternal and blissful heaven; the stage\nto which belong Taoism and various forms of Hinduism or\nBrahmanism.\n\n4th to 10th states: Buddhist stages (the fourth\nto ninth being exoteric Buddhism and the tenth being esoteric\nBuddhism):\n\n4th to 5th states: Hin\u0101y\u0101na stages:\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of those who aspire towards self-enlightenment\nwithout caring for the enlightenment of others.\n\n4th state: \u201cThe mind of one affirming only the\nelements and negating the self\u201d (yuiun muga-shin): The\nstate of the \u015br\u0101vaka who analyzes phenomena into\nthe psycho-physical \u201caggregates\u201d (skandhas)\nand/or the elements (dharmas), to thus negate any belief in a\npermanent ego (atman); the stage to which belong the\nteachings of the historical Buddha and his direct disciples and of the\nAbhidharma scholastics. While the substantiality of reality\nis thus deconstructed into its elemental dharmas, the\ndharmas themselves however become fetters, thus taking from\nthree lives to sixty aeons to achieve liberation.\n\n5th state: \u201cThe mind freed from karmic seeds\u201d\n(batsu g\u014dinju-shin): The state of the\npratyeka-buddhas, who, masterless on their own, attain\ninsight into the chain of dependent origination to recognize the\nimpermanence, self-less-ness, and non-substantiality of all, thus\npreventing new karma to arise. But in enjoying a certain level of\n\u201cenlightenment,\u201d they fall back into the\n\u201cegoism\u201d of self-complacency, compassionless apathy\ntowards fellow beings, and the narrow vision of other-worldliness.\nHence they have not yet reached complete enlightenment. The\nSautr\u0101ntika school belongs to this stage.\n\n6th to 9th states: Mah\u0101y\u0101na stages:\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of the bodhisattvas, those who seek\nenlightenment both for self and for others, by overcoming self-other\nduality and recognizing the interdependency between self-enlightenment\nand other-enlightenment and between wisdom and compassion.\n\n6th state: \u201cThe mind of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nadherent who is concerned with others\u201d (taen\ndaij\u014d-shin): The state of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra with its\nVij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101 (Jpn: yuishiki)\nstandpoint that everything is \u201cmind-only,\u201d reached by its\nanalysis of thing-events as phenomena of consciousness originating\nfrom a deep un-conscious \u201cstorehouse\u201d or \u201creceptacle\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na). Its\npoint is to detach oneself from the discriminating objectification of\nphenomena in order to realize the tranquility of\n\u201cmind-only\u201d from a non-discriminating perspective, which\nwould allow the practice of \u201cgreat compassion.\u201d And yet\nthis still takes several aeons of practice to achieve and is not the\nfinal state.\n\n7th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes\nnon-origination\u201d (kakushin fush\u014d-shin): The state\nof Madhyamaka with its \u015b\u016bnyav\u0101da (Jpn:\nk\u016bgan) standpoint that everything is empty. Here\nreifying and substantializing conceptions \u2013 including both\nobjects and mind \u2013 that act as fetters are eliminated through\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s eight-fold negations which via\ntheir dependent origination show their emptiness.\n\n8th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes harmony with\nthe one path of truth\u201d (nyojitsu ichid\u014d-shin or\nichid\u014d muishin): The state of T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\nwith its standpoint of \u201coneness of all,\u201d wherein one\nrealizes that one moment contains eternity, a single thought contains\nall possible worlds, and a sesame seed contains a mountain, i.e. the\nnon-duality between one and many; and between emptiness, dependent\norigination, and their \u201cmiddle.\u201d\n\n9th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes the absence\nof substance within ultimate truth\u201d (goku\nmujish\u014d-shin): The state of Hua-yen with its standpoint of\nthe mutual non-obstruction and interpenetration between the\npatternment (Chn: li; Jpn: ri) of all and the\nconcrete thing-events (Chn: shih; Jpn: ji) on the\nbasis of their emptiness, whereby one and many are non-dualistic. This\nnon-duality is extended to the level of the entire\ndharmadh\u0101tu.\n\n10th state: Both Tendai and Kegon for K\u016bkai however\nlack the crucial element of direct experiential understanding to truly\nrealize what they preach. One must thus proceed further by means of\nbodily ritual practice provided by the next and final state:\nMantray\u0101na: \u201cThe mind of secret sublimity\u201d\n(himitsu sh\u014dgon-shin). This is the state of Shingon,\nwhose esoteric teachings and bodily experiential practice constitute\nthe summit of the development of the mind. At this summit hosshin\nsepp\u014d is revealed and one attains\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu through the micro-macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity of the three mysteries and through kaji. \n\nRather than rejecting or negating the previous states, this final\nstate fulfills and encompasses their standpoints from what is claimed\nto be the most comprehensive standpoint, in view of \u2013 or rather\nin non-duality with \u2013 the Dharma. In light of the Dharma, the\ntruths taught in those previous states are but relative or provisional\ntruths, expedient means that are helpful only insofar as they lead one\ntowards this final truth but which can also serve as fetters if one\nbecomes attached to them. Each state is referred to as a\n\u201cpalace\u201d (ky\u016b or g\u016b), which\nare all combined in the one grand cosmic palace\n(hokkaig\u016b or hokkai shinden). This grand palace\nconstitutes the entire cosmos as a mandala, with the tenth and highest\nstate, the innermost secret palace of Dainichi, at the center and\nsummit from which the Dharma emanates into its various manifestations\nin the lower states, the outer palaces. The closer one is to the\ncenter, the stronger one feels the pull of kaji drawing one\nup towards the central summit. But as stated above, the sequential\nordering of the hierarchy is not necessary when the whole is viewed\nfrom this most comprehensive standpoint. For the grand cosmic palace\npenetrates and comprehends all of the specific palaces or dwellings of\nthe mind. Hence one can make a sudden leap from any point in this\ncosmic mandala towards the center by successfully engaging in the\nesoteric practice of Shingon Buddhism. It is this mandalic structure\nthat the term mandala in the title of the longer version of\nthis work (Treatise on the Secret Mandala of the Ten States of\nMind) signifies. It refers to the blueprint of the cosmic\nembodiment of the Dharma (hosshin), which in turn structures\none\u2019s (ritual) practice in its arrangement and how one\naccordingly experiences the Dharma.\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAmong the better known philosophers of the Kyoto School, references to\nK\u016bkai or Shingon, when compared to Zen or Pure Land Buddhism, are\nhardly noticeable. It has been suggested that this neglect may have\nsomething to do with an intellectual\u2019s prejudice against the\n\u201cesoteric,\u201d e.g. the significance of ritual with its\nsymbols and images, which are not so easily amenable to rational\ncomprehension and instead conjure up preconceptions of the\n\u201coccult\u201d and the \u201cmagical.\u201d However the\nphilosophical aspects of Shingon Buddhism are often traceable to the\nsame Mah\u0101y\u0101na seeds that sprouted Zen. Once such prejudices\nare overcome, it would not be so difficult for the contemporary\nphilosopher to find in K\u016bkai a well-spring of ideas and thoughts\nwhich may be of interest today.\n\nWe need to acknowledge, however, that K\u016bkai and Shingon Buddhism\nin general have not altogether been ignored by contemporary\nphilosophers of Japan. Even within the Kyoto School, its current\nrepresentative Ueda Shizuteru in a 1993 lecture, Basho to\nmandara, discusses the significance of mandalas in Shingon\nBuddhism in relation to the ontological structure of human existence\nunderstood in his terms as being-in-the-twofold-world. In his analysis\nof K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalas, Ueda approriates contemporary\nphilosophical concepts, such as Nishida\u2019s \u201cplace\u201d\n(basho), Nishitani\u2019s \u201cfield\u201d (ba),\nand Heidegger\u2019s \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d\n(In-der-Welt-sein), and takes the mandala as indicative of\nthe always assumed semantic space (imi k\u016bkan) belonging\nto the world (sekai) as the total framework of meanings\n(imi no waku gumi) wherein we find ourselves. A couple of\nother graduates of Kyoto University\u2019s philosophy department have\nentire books on K\u016bkai. In K\u016bkai no shis\u014d ni\ntsuite, Umehara Takeshi discusses K\u016bkai both as a religious\npractitioner and as a theorist, who explicates the world\u2019s\ninfinite \u201ctreasure\u201d unfolding within the self. And\nex-Nishidian turned Marxist, Yanagida Kenj\u016br\u014d, has a study\non K\u016bkai and his works: Nihon shingon no tetsugaku:\nK\u016bkai Hiz\u014dh\u014dyaku to Ben\u2019kenmitsu\nniky\u014dron.\n\nAmong other twentieth century Japanese philosophers, Yuasa Yasuo,\nknown for his theory of the body, often refers to the doctrines and\npractices of Shingon Buddhism, and has writen entire chapters on\nK\u016bkai in Shintairon: T\u014dy\u014dteki shinshin ron to\ngendai and The Body: Towards an Eastern Mind-Body\nTheory. Comparative philosopher of religion, Izutsu Toshihiko, as\nwell, in Ishiki to honshitsu and other works, has found\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas \u2013 especially his\ncosmological-linguistic theory \u2013 inspiring enough to incorporate\ninto his own theory of essence as part of his attempt to build a\nsynthetic \u201cOriental philosophy\u201d (t\u014dy\u014d\ntetsugaku). Philosopher of Buddhist thought, Tamaki\nK\u014dshir\u014d discusses the significance of K\u016bkai\u2019s\nphilosophy within the history of Japanese Buddhism in his Nihon\nbukky\u014d shis\u014d ron. And philosopher of religion and\nreligious studies scholar Nakazawa Shin\u2019ichi, like Ueda, focuses\non K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalic philosophy in his book, Seppen\nkyokusenron. He reads K\u016bkai\u2019s works on Shingon as\ninvolving a hydrodynamic mode of thinking that in its flexibility\ndeals with the non-Euclidean currents of nature with its forces of\nreality, undulating in ripples and forming vortexes. He views the\nShingon mandala as approximating, with its circles and lines, what is\nexpressed in today\u2019s fractal geometry, whereby the\ninfinitesimally microcosmic part endlessly and indefinitely iterates\nthe patterns of the whole of nature in its innumerable vortexes and\ncurves.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas engender an holistic view towards nature and\nthe cosmos as encompassing ourselves and in our interrelationships\nwith others. They may be of relevance to the dilemmas we face today in\nthis epoch of globalization, religious wars, technological\n\u201cenframing\u201d (to use Heidegger\u2019s terminology), and\nenvironmental hazards. And in terms of scholarship, as can be seen in\nsome of the above-mentioned Japanese scholars\u2019 works on\nK\u016bka, K\u016bkai offers a wealth of ideas for comparative\nanalyses: e.g. with Derrida on the world as text, with Process thought\non \u201ccosmo-holism,\u201d with Merleau-Ponty or Deleuze on the\nsignificance of the body and bodily spatiality and interrelationality\nvis-\u00e0-vis the environment, with Nishida or Hegel on dialectics\nand interrelationality, or with major \u201cmystic\u201d thinkers of\nother religious traditions such as Ibn Arabi of Islam or Meister\nEckhart of Christianity on a dynamic non-duality as opposed to both\nstatic monism and subject-object dualism. K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking\nprovides a wealth of insights, of much value, to offer to philosophers\nof today. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1972. <em>K\u016bkai: Major Works Translated, with an Account of\nhis Life and a Study of his Thought</em>, Yoshito S.
