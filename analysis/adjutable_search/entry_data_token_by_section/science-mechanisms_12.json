    "main_text": "Explanation: From Formal Analyses to Material Structures || Philosophical Work to Be Done\n3.4 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nTo date, much of the work on mechanistic explanation has been\ndriven by the goal of providing a descriptively and normatively\nadequate theory of mechanistic explanation. Some claim there are kinds\nof explanation that rely very little on a precise understanding of the\nmechanistic details of a system (Woodward 2014; Weiskopf 2011) or that\nwork fundamentally by removing all such details from one\u2019s model\n(Batterman and Rice 2014). Resolving such debates will require being\nvery clear about precisely what one expects out of a philosophical\ntheory of scientific explanation and what one takes a scientific\nexplanation to be (Strevens 2008; Craver 2014). Research is required\nto understand the diverse representational forms that scientists use\nto represent mechanisms (Burnston et al. forthcoming), and to\nunderstand the role of idealization in mechanistic explanation (Levy\nand Bechtel 2012; Huneman 2010). Further work is also required to limn\nthe boundaries between mechanistic explanation and other putative\nvarieties of explanation and to say, as perspicuously as Hempel or the\ncausal-mechanical theory, what a model must do to count as explanatory\nand precisely how good explanations are to be distinguished from\nbad.\n",
