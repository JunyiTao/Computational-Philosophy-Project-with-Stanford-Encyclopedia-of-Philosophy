    "main_text": "Bacon as an Aristotelian Commentator || Bacon on Matter\n4.3 Bacon on Matter\n\nIn the later (post 1260) Communia naturalium, Bacon gives six\nmeanings for the concept of matter. (1) Matter is the subject of\naction as when we say that wood is the matter for the action of the\ncarpenter. (2) In the proper sense of the term, matter is that which,\nwith form, constitutes the composite, as in the case of every created\nsubstance. (3) Matter is the subject of generation and corruption and\nhas the property of being an incomplete and imperfect thing in potency\nto being a complete thing. (4) Matter is the subject of alteration\nsince it receives contrary accidents. (5) Matter can be considered as\nan individual in relation to the universal, the latter being founded\nin its individual as in a material principle. (6) Matter is the name\nfor that which is gross, as when we say that earth has more matter\nthan fire (Sharp 1930, 127\u2013151).\n\nForm has a certain priority to matter as the end of generation and as\nthe perfection of the material principle. It is the principle of\naction and of knowledge. In general, for Bacon, matter is not a mere\npotency. It is an incomplete something (substance) and so for him\nmatter and form are two incomplete substances that integrate to make\none individual substance. In this one has a notion of matter\nas in some sense a positive thing. It is not a nullity. One way to\nplace Bacon\u2019s position on matter is to situate it between the\nmaterial monism of David of Dinant and the position of Aquinas that\nmatter is a pure potentiality. For Bacon, matter as a being of essence\n(esse essentiae) has being in itself. For Aquinas, form alone\ngives being. But for Bacon the being of essence and existence belong\ntogether. Matter, therefore, can be a principle of division. Unlike a\nmonist position, Bacon stresses the plurality of matters. The relation\nof universal and particular with respect to matter and form in Bacon\nis complex. One notes the influence of Avicenna. \n\nIn both early and later works, Bacon objects to the idea that matter\nis one in number in all things. The background to this issue arises in\nthe 1240s to 1270s of the Fons vitae of Avicebron (Solomon\nIbn Gebirol) and from Franciscan discussions at Paris on the nature of\nthe unity of matter. Bacon holds that matter \u201cis not numerically\none, but in itself and from itself it is numerically distinct in\nnumerically different beings.\u201d Still, he does not object to a\nlogical unity of matter. For example, matter as potentiality is the\noriginal source of the being of contingent things. This is the\nnon-being of the creature in contrast with the being of the Creator.\nMatter properly speaking is prime matter. This must be distinguished\nfrom both natural matter and from artificial matterThus, Bacon will\nspeak of the matter of both corporeal and spiritual beings, and hence\nof \u201cspiritual matter,\u201d a concept that Aquinas found to be\ncontradictory. The importance of this hylomorphism in the\nFranciscan school at Paris has been examined by Anna Rodolfi (2010,\n2014). And the complexity of natural matter with reference to\ngeneration and also to alchemical process has been set out with care\nby Michele Pereira (2014). Bacon\u2019s doctrine of matter as a\nsource for the theory of matter in Peter John Olivi has been noted by\nthe editors of Pierre de Jean Olivi Sur le materie (2008).\nBacon\u2019s extended account of matter in his early and later works\nis very significant for the late thirteenth and early fourteenth\ncentury discussions of the concept of matter.\n\n\nIn his later works, and specifically in his works on natural\nphilosophy, Bacon presents nature as an active agent. The form or the\nspecies is the first effect of any natural agent. The power of the\nspecies educes the emergence of the thing from the potency of matter.\nIt does not simply produce a form/species and impose it on the matter.\nMatter has an active potency, and this is actualized due to\nthe action of the natural external agent.
