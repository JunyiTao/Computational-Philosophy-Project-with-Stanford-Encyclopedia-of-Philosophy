    "main_text": "The Nature of Judgment\n1. The Nature of Judgment\n\nTheories of cognitive judgment both prior to and after Kant tend to\ndivide dichotomously into the psychologistic and\nplatonistic camps, according to which, on the one hand,\ncognitive judgments are nothing but mental representations of\nrelations of ideas, as, e.g., in the Port Royal Logic (Arnaud &\nNicole 1996), or mentalistic ordered combinings of real individuals,\nuniversals, and logical constants, as, e.g., in Russell\u2019s early\ntheory of judgment (Russell 1966), or on the other hand, cognitive\njudgments are nothing but assertoric psychological states or attitudes\naimed at mind-independent, abstract propositions or thoughts, as,\ne.g., in Bolzano\u2019s and Frege\u2019s theories of judgment\n(Bolzano 1972, Frege 1979, Frege 1984). And, seemingly, never the\ntwain shall meet (Martin 2006, Hanna 2006a, ch. 1). But by sharp\ncontrast to both the psychologistic and platonistic camps,\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is at once cognitivist,\nanti-psychologistic, and anti-platonistic. More precisely, according\nto Kant, judgments are complex conscious cognitions that (i) refer to\nobjects either directly (via intuitions) or indirectly (via concepts),\n(ii) include concepts that are predicated either of those objects or\nof other constituent concepts, (iii) exemplify pure logical concepts\nand enter into inferences according to pure logical laws, (iv)\nessentially involve both the following of rules and the application of\nrules to the objects picked out by intuitions, (v) express true or\nfalse propositions (truth-aptness), (vi) mediate the formation of\nbeliefs and other intentional acts, and (vii) are unified and\nself-conscious.\n\nThe three leading features of this account are, first, Kant\u2019s\ntaking the innate capacity for judgment to be the central cognitive\nfaculty of the human mind, in the sense that judgment, alone among our\nvarious cognitive achievements, is the joint product of all of the\nother cognitive faculties operating coherently and systematically\ntogether under a single higher-order unity of rational\nself-consciousness (the centrality thesis); second,\nKant\u2019s insistence on the explanatory priority of the\npropositional content of a judgment over its basic cognitive-semantic\nconstituents (i.e., intuitions and concepts), over the logical form of\njudgments, over the inferential role of judgments, over the rule-like\ncharacter of the judgment, over the self-conscious psychological\nstates in which propositions are grasped as well as the\nnon-self-conscious psychological processes in which propositions are\nsynthetically generated, over epistemic beliefs in those propositions,\nover all other propositional attitudes, and also over intentional acts\nguided and mediated by those propositions, including non-epistemic\nacts of various kinds (the priority-of-the-proposition\nthesis); and third, Kant\u2019s background metaphysical doctrine\nto the effect that judgments are empirically meaningful (objectively\nvalid) and true (objectively real) if and only if transcendental\nidealism is correct (the transcendental idealism thesis).\n",
