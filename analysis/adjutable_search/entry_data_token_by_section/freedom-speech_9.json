    "main_text": "Democracy and Free Speech || Democratic Citizenship and Hate Speech\n4.2 Democratic Citizenship and Hate Speech\n\nTo argue the case above, one has to dilute one's support for freedom\nof expression in favor of other principles, such as equal respect for\nall citizens. This is a sensible approach according to Stanley Fish.\nHe suggests that the task we face is not to arrive at hard and fast\nprinciples that prioritise all speech. Instead, we have to find a\nworkable compromise that gives due weight to a variety of values.\nSupporters of this view will remind us that when we are discussing\nfree speech, we are not dealing with it in isolation; what we are\ndoing is comparing free speech with some other good. We have to decide\nwhether it is better to place a higher value on speech than on the\nvalue of privacy, security, equality, or the prevention of harm.\n\nFish suggests we need to find a balance in which \u201cwe must\nconsider in every case what is at stake and what are the risks and\ngains of alternative courses of action\u201d (1994, 111). Is speech\npromoting or undermining our basic values? \u201cIf you don't ask\nthis question, or some version of it, but just say that speech is\nspeech and that's it, you are mystifying\u2014presenting as an\narbitrary and untheorized fiat\u2014a policy that will seem whimsical\nor worse to those whose interests it harms or dismisses\u201d (1994,\n123).\n\nThe task is not to come up with principles that always favors\nexpression, but rather, to decide what is good speech and what is bad\nspeech. A good policy \u201cwill not assume that the only relevant\nsphere of action is the head and larynx of the individual\nspeaker\u201d (Fish, 1994, 126). Is it more in keeping with the\nvalues of a democratic society, in which every person is deemed equal,\nto allow or prohibit speech that singles out specific individuals and\ngroups as less than equal? Fish's answer is that, \u201cit depends. I\nam not saying that First Amendment principles are inherently bad (they\nare inherently nothing), only that they are not always the appropriate\nreference point for situations involving the production of\nspeech\u201d (1994, 113). But, all things considered, \u201cI am\npersuaded that at the present moment, right now, the risk of not\nattending to hate speech is greater than the risk that by regulating\nit we will deprive ourselves of valuable voices and insights or slide\ndown the slippery slope towards tyranny. This is a judgement for which\nI can offer reasons but no guarantees\u201d (1994, 115). \n\nThese kinds of justification for prohibitions on hate speech suggest\nthat the permissive approach undermines free speech properly\nunderstood. Even if hate speech or pornography does not cause harm (in\nMill's sense) or offense, it has to be limited because it is\nincompatible with democracy iteslf. The argument from democracy\ncontends that political speech is essential not only for the\nlegitimacy of the regime, but for providing an environment where\npeople can develop and exercise their goals, talents, and abilities.\nIf hate speech and pornography curtail the development of such\ncapacities in certain sections of the community, we have an argument,\nbased on reasons used to justify free speech, for prohibition.\n\nAccording to Fish, the boundaries of free speech cannot be set in\nstone by philosophical principles. It is the world of politics that\ndecides what we can and cannot say guided, but not hidebound, by the\nworld of abstract philosophy. Fish suggests that free speech is about\npolitical victories and defeats. The very guidelines for marking off\nprotected from unprotected speech are the result of this battle rather\nthan truths in their own right: \u201cNo such thing as free\n(nonideologically constrained) speech; no such thing as a public forum\npurged of ideological pressures of exclusion\u201d (Fish, 1994, 116).\nSpeech always takes place in an environment of convictions,\nassumptions, and perceptions i.e., within the confines of a structured\nworld. The thing to do, according to Fish, is get out there and argue\nfor one's position.\n\nWe should ask three questions according to Fish: \u201c[g]iven that\nit is speech, what does it do, do we want it to be done, and is more\nto be gained or lost by moving to curtail it?\u201d (1994, 127). He\nsuggests that the answers we arrive at will vary according to the\ncontext. Free speech will be more limited in the military, where the\nunderlying value is hierarchy and authority, than it will be at a\nuniversity where one of the main values is the expression of ideas.\nEven on campus, there will be different levels of appropriate speech.\nSpouting off at the fountain in the centre of campus should be less\nregulated than what a professor can say during a lecture. It might\nwell be acceptable for me to spend an hour of my time explaining to\npassers-by why Manchester United is a great football team but it would\nbe completely inappropriate (and open to censure) to do the same thing\nwhen I am supposed to be giving a lecture on Thomas Hobbes. A campus\nis not simply a \u201cfree speech forum but a workplace where people\nhave contractual obligations, assigned duties, pedagogical and\nadministrative responsibilities\u201d (1994,129). Almost all places\nin which we interact are governed by underlying values and speech will\nhave to fit in with these ideals: \u201c[r]egulation of free speech\nis a defining feature of everyday life\u201d (Fish, 1994,129).\nThinking of speech in this way removes a lot of its mystique. Whether\nwe should ban hate speech is another problem, albeit more serious,\nsimilar to whether we should allow university professors to talk about\nfootball in lectures.\n",
