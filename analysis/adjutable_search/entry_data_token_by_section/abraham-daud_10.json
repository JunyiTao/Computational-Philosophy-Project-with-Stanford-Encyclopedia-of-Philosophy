    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Free Will\n5.6 Free Will\n\n\nThe topics that have been discussed thus far are all considered by Ibn\nDaud to be necessary steps towards the solution of the problem of the\nfreedom of the human will. Towards the end of the book, he finally\naddresses the issue within the context of a cluster of related\nproblems, such as God\u2019s knowledge, the nature of evil, causality\nand providence. Ibn Daud\u2019s theory of physical evil is to a large\nextent based on Ibn Sina\u2019s approach. It is impossible that God\nshould be the agent of evil. The evil that is found in nature is due\nto matter. In fact, it is a privation, just as darkness is the\nprivation of light. As such it is not-being and cannot be brought\nabout by an agent. Moreover, what an individual considers to be evil\ncan be a benefit for mankind as a whole. In line with Ibn Daud\u2019s\nconception of man as a microcosm, evil in man is likewise to be\nascribed to his matter and to the absence of knowledge. However, man\nis able to free himself from matter by means of knowledge, that is, by\nthe actualization of his potential intellect with the help of the\nintelligences so as to be able to discriminate between good and evil.\nAnother remedy for the resistance of evil lies in the Torah.\nMan\u2019s choice to fight his evil inclination is neither necessary,\nnor impossible, but possible. To explain this, Ibn Daud states that\nGod provided certain created things with possibility. However, the\n\u201cpossible\u201d can be divided into two kinds, the first being\nthe \u201cpossible\u201d that is due to ignorance, for example that\nthe people of Spain do not know whether the king of Babylon died today\nor whether he is alive. To them the matter is possible because of\ntheir ignorance of what happens far away whereas in itself the matter\nis not possible: one of the alternatives must necessarily be true\n(ER W 96.11\u201316; S 205b11\u201314). With respect to the second kind\nof the \u201cpossible\u201d Ibn Daud says that it is\n\u201cpossible\u201d\n\n because God made it as \u201cpossible\u201d and created it as\nsomething that admits of two contrary attributes, either this or that,\njust as it happened to be\u2014as regards this [kind of possible]\none cannot deny that God knows it as possible. And if someone would\nobject by saying \u201cdoes God not know the end of the\nmatter?\u201d we reply that this is not ignorance (ER W\n96.21\u201325; S 206a5\u20139).\n \n\n\nMoreover, Ibn Daud makes use of a fourfold division of causes that\nhe found in Halevi (Kuzari V.20): besides necessary causes that God knows as\nnecessary, there are natural and incidental causes that are entrusted\nto secondary causes. The fourth category consists of free causes or\n\u201ccauses due to choice\u201d, thanks to which man is free to\nchoose between good and evil. In other words, God has no foreknowledge\nas regards human action. This rather drastic conclusion is quite\nunusual in Jewish philosophy; prior to Ibn Daud no Jewish philosopher\nwas prepared to limit God\u2019s knowledge to save the notion of free\nwill. In Ibn Daud\u2019s view, however, this position does not involve\nignorance in God.\n\n\nOnce man has made a choice with respect to moral conduct, the angels\nassist him in carrying out his choice. Moreover, the providence\nexercised by the angels is commensurate with man\u2019s own efforts.\nIn this way, the biblical verses that seem to convey that human action\nis determined by God are to be explained: the \u201chardening\u201d\nof Pharaoh\u2019s heart (Ex. 7:3) means that the intelligences helped him to\npersist in carrying out his own bad choices.\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s approach to the question of free will is not\nwithout serious difficulties. Firstly, his conception of evil as\nprivation and as associated with matter conflicts with his initial\nconception of matter as a substance. Secondly, on the one hand, Ibn\nDaud argues that it is the intellect that chooses between good and\nevil, yet he also claims that the choice is a matter of man\u2019s\nheart, without explaining how these two notions relate. Finally, he has\nnothing to say on the possibility of \u201crepentance\u201d, which\nseems to imply that man is determined as it were by his own first\nchoice.\n\n\nUnsatisfactory as Ibn Daud\u2019s solution may be, he has\nnonetheless succeeded in removing the contradiction between biblical\nverses on the issue and thus in establishing harmony between philosophy\nand religion. It was important for him to demonstrate this harmony with\nrespect to all the topics that led up to the question under\nconsideration, but it is essential with respect to free will, because\nhere philosophical speculation and religious practice intertwine. For\nIbn Daud, there is no point in leading a religious life when man is not\nfree to choose. This issue of free will therefore marks the transition\nfrom philosophical speculation to practical philosophy, which is the\nsubject of the last part of ER.\n",
