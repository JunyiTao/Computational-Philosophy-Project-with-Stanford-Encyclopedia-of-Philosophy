    "main_text": "Direct, Extensional Arguments || For Internalism\n3.2 For Internalism\n3.2.1 The Significance of Apparent Internal Reasons\n\n\nSo far we have considered extensional arguments against\ninternalism. But there are also extensional arguments in\nfavor of internalist theses. Setting aside peculiarly\nmoral reasons, common sense suggests that ordinary practical\nreasons exhibit a high degree of agent-relativity. It is also\nnatural to think that in at least many cases, different agents have\ndifferent reasons because they want different things. If\nA desires chocolate ice cream, and B desires\nstrawberry ice cream, then intuitively A has a reason to\npurchase the chocolate, and B has a reason to purchase the\nstrawberry. Many have thought that the Humean Theory of Reasons is\nmore than suggested by this sort of extensional data.\n\n\nThe idea behind this reasoning is that if we have to agree that\nsome reasons depend on desires, then we should give serious\nconsideration to the theory according to which all reasons do,\nas being simpler and more explanatory than the theory according to\nwhich some reasons derive from our desires but others do not.\nThis may even provide a promising analytical hypothesis about what\nclaims about reasons mean, or reductive hypothesis about what reasons\nare. This kind of argument is anticipated by Williams\u2019 claim that\nthe issue is whether there are both internal and external reasons, or\ninternal reasons only (1979; see also Schroeder 2007b). We now\ndiscuss three kinds of externalist objection to this argument.\n3.2.2 Three Objections\n\n\nOne line of objection holds that no reasons derive from our\ndesires. It seems plausible that they do only because desire is\nclosely connected to something else, which often is a source\nof reasons: something like pleasure or\nenjoyment (Bond 1983, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998).\nReasons that seem to derive from desires can arguably be more plausibly\nexplained by pleasure, which can also serve to explain reasons that\ndesire cannot explain: reasons deriving from pleasures that the\nagent does not actually desire. It may therefore be a better and\nmore explanatory hypothesis that something like pleasure\ngrounds our agent-relative reasons. However proponents of this\nkind of objection often take hedonic states like pleasure to be merely\none instance of something possessing intrinsic value, and\noffer as rivals to HTR theories of reasons as based on intrinsic value\n(see the entry on \n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value).\n\n\n\nIn response, Humeans can observe that in ordinary cases agents\nwant pleasure, and that thereby HTR can accommodate such\nreasons. This line of objection needs a case in which an agent\nhas a reason to do not just something that she does not already desire\nto do, but something that would not serve any desire whatsoever that\nshe already has. Since any given action may serve many different\npossible desires, and agents who do not desire (e.g.) pleasure are rare\nand peculiar, it is difficult to control for these kinds of\nfactors. Externalists can claim that an agent would have a reason\nto do what is pleasurable even in the absence of any such general\ndesire, but this is something that an internalist may be able to deny\nwithout absurdity\u2014although here intuitions seem to differ\nradically.\n\n\nA related objection consists in the complaint that agents can have\ndesires that clearly do not generate any practical reasons because they\nare for worthless objects. Prominent examples in the literature\ninclude a desire to drink a saucer of mud or a can of paint, and a\ndisposition to turn on radios whenever they are off. As noted in\nsection 3.1.3, these examples can\u2019t provide direct counterexamples to\nany sort of reasons internalism, because reasons internalism itself\nplaces only a necessary condition on reasons and not a sufficient\ncondition, and these examples are proposed counterexamples to a\nsufficient condition. But they are highly relevant to the\ntheoretical argument for internalism that is our concern in this\nsection. If we advance as our case for internalism the\nexplanatory power of the thesis that reasons depend on desire or\nmotivation, then it is a significant problem if this relation isn\u2019t\nconsistent and desire or motivation don\u2019t always generate\nreasons. Some explanation of this inconsistency is needed, and\nwhen we find it we may find that it reveals that something other than\ndesire or motivation is the genuine source of our reasons.\n\n\nThese cases are taken to show that desires are only connected with\nreasons if they are also connected with something else, for example\nintrinsic value, and they do not yield reasons otherwise. Against\nthis the internalist can again challenge intuitions and defend the\nconsistency of the connection, by insisting (e.g.) that a desire to\ndrink a saucer of mud is sufficient for having a reason to do so.\nSuch a reason need not be a good or strong one, after all, and the\npeculiarity of claiming that there is such a reason may be explained\naway as being merely pragmatic. In cases in which the reasons for\nan action are dwarfed by the considerations against it, it is usual to\nreport that there is no reason for the action at all; \u2018there is a\nreason to do A\u2019 typically communicates that there is a\nrelatively weighty reason to do A. Whether or not agents\nhave desire-based reasons in these circumstances remains a contested\nissue.\n\n\nA different version of this same sort of objection works by granting\na special connection between reasons and desire but suggesting that\nthis exists because desires involve judgments or perceptions that\nsomething is a reason (e.g. Anscombe 1963, Stampe 1987, Quinn\n1993, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998). Scanlon labels these\n\u2018desires in the directed-attention sense\u2019; on this view,\n(apparent) reasons are explanatory of desires, and not the\nreverse. This hypothesis would explain why agents tend to have\nrelevant desires whenever they believe themselves to have\nreasons, but it does not seem well-placed to explain why agents would\nhave these desires whenever they actually have reasons.\nIf we are disposed to ascribe reasons to others in\ncorrespondence with their desires, the Humean hypothesis is better.\n\n\nA third kind of objection (Hampton 1998) insists that though it is\ntrue that some reasons derive from our desires, this is only because of\nmore fundamental reasons which themselves do not derive from our\ndesires. Proponents of this view hold that there is a fundamental\nreason to do what you desire and that changes in what you desire simply\naffect what you need to do in order to go about doing so. This\nview admits that our desires can sometimes affect our reasons but\ninsists that they only do so because there is a further reason, which\ndoes not depend on any desire. Philosophers who accept this view\nare unmoved by the argument that Actual State forms of reason\ninternalism can provide a more unified explanation of reasons.\nThey don\u2019t deny the existence of \u2018internal\u2019 reasons (which\ndo derive from desires), but do hold that internal reasons are simply\nderivative from and hence are explained by a special case of external\nreasons (which do not derive from or depend on desires at all). A\nsimilar dialectic goes for Actual State views which appeal to a more\ngeneral kind of state than \u2018desire\u2019.\n3.3 Relative Explanatory Power\n\n\nAny evaluation of whether Actual State reasons internalism is\nsimpler, more elegant, or explanatorily more powerful than any possible\nexternalist view will have to turn on an evaluation of this kind of\nexternalist explanatory strategy. If internal reasons could be\nsimply derivative from external reasons, and external reasons could be\nindependently explained, then Actual State reasons internalism will\nhave very little traction on these grounds. If the derivation of\ninternal reasons from external reasons turns out to be unsuccessful,\nhowever, or external reasons themselves are difficult to explain, then\nActual State reasons internalism will gain traction as an explanatory\nhypothesis. Schroeder (2007b) attacks the derivation of internal\nreasons from external reasons; here we can go on to consider whether\nexternal reasons are themselves harder to explain than internal\nones.\n\n\nMany philosophers have held that external reasons are, in fact,\nharder to explain than internal ones; even some who were no skeptics\nabout external reasons, like Immanuel Kant (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)  \n So what makes external reasons so puzzling? One\nidea is that they are puzzling because they leave so little on the\nbasis of which to explain why they are reasons for the people for whom\nthey are reasons. Internal reasons are shared only by certain\npeople\u2014people with the requisite desires. So Max\u2019s desires\ncan be used to explain why he has the internal reasons that he\nhas. But categorical external reasons like those Kant was\nconcerned about (and which are required in order to reconcile Moral\nRationalism with Moral Absolutism) are supposed to be reasons for any\nagent, no matter what she is like. So the only thing to which we\ncan appeal in order to explain why Max has these reasons is the fact\nthat Max is an agent. Some philosophers have accordingly\ninvested great energy in developing robust enough accounts of agency to\nbe able to explain moral reasons. For example, Christine\nKorsgaard (1996) maintains that reasons derive from the demands of\nautonomy, or being regulated by stable principles that define\nones\u2019 self, which she identifies as a necessary condition for\nacting at all.\n\n\nHowever, even accounts that derive reasons from the nature of agency\nmay ultimately vindicate some form of internalism. David Velleman\n(1996), for example, argues that agency is characterized by a\nparticular higher-order inclination\u2014to \u2018behave in, and out\nof, a knowledge of what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Although this is a\nkind of desire, it is distinct from the contingent desires that might\nbe satisfied by particular actions and which internalists usually\nidentify as the source of our reasons. Velleman accordingly\ndescribes his view as a \u2018fainthearted externalism\u2019, but it\nremains a form of internalism according to the scheme presented\nhere.\n\n\nSome advocates of various forms of internalism have complained that\nadvocacy of external reasons amounts to nothing more than\n\u2018bluff\u2019 (Williams 1979). A natural way to understand\nthis idea is as the complaint that external reasons theorists leave us\nwith too few constraints on what reasons could be, and hence are able\nto make whatever claims about reasons they want (so long as they\nendorse them in a serious enough tone of voice, perhaps), with no\nindependent way of checking their plausibility. This complaint\ncould be a fair one against externalists who are willing to offer no\ngeneral theory about or constraints on reasons, but it is unfair in\ngeneral. Externalists may simply look for discipline and unity in\ntheir views about reasons from a source distinct from facts about\nmotivation or motivational psychology. Value-based theorists, for\nexample, tie their claims about reasons to commitments about what is\nvaluable. So their claims about what we have reasons to do are\nchecked by the plausibility of the corresponding theses about what is\nvaluable.\n4. The Debate Today\n\n\nThe debate over internal and external reasons is very much alive\ntoday, open on nearly all of the fronts that we have considered in this\narticle. Or more accurately, we should say that the\ndebates over internal and external reasons are very much alive\ntoday. As we saw, there are important differences between State\nand Motivation forms of internalism, between Counterfactual and Actual\nforms of internalism, and between versions that give rise to the\nCentral Problem and those that do not. There are also important\nfurther differences in precisely how to formulate any given version of\nreasons internalism, and we have not precisely formulated any single\nversion in this article.\n\n\nWhat is clear is that there are two main varieties of internalist\nview, each of which faces its own class of problems. Most\ninternalist views encounter the Central Problem, and hence have\ndifficulty in allowing for some of the important reasons that we\npre-theoretically are inclined to think that there are. Though\nother arguments have been offered against them, this challenge is at\nthe heart of their difficulties. We saw that some Counterfactual\nversions of internalism avoid the Central Problem, by claiming that the\nrelevant counterfactuals are not grounded in any features of agents\u2019\nactual psychologies, but rather are explained in some other way.\nThe challenge facing these views is to provide such an explanation\nwithout collapsing into triviality, as with the view that the relevant\ncounterfactual condition is \u2018that the agent is motivated by all\nof her reasons\u2019.\n\n\nExternalist views, on the other hand, avoid the Central Problem and\nhence do well with moral reasons, but critics worry that external\nreasons are more mysterious, and that such theories cannot provide as\nattractive an explanation of why some reasons do\nappear to be internal. An attractive way forward may have to show\nentrenched parties how to achieve some of the important advantages of\neach side of the debate.",
