    "main_text": "What is a Nation? || The Basic Concept of Nationalism\n1.1 The Basic Concept of Nationalism\n\nAlthough the term \u201cnationalism\u201d has a variety of meanings,\nit centrally encompasses two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the\nmembers of a nation have when they care about their identity as\nmembers of that nation and (2) the actions that the members of a\nnation take in seeking to achieve (or sustain) some form of political\nsovereignty (see for example, Nielsen 1998\u20139: 9). Each of these\naspects requires elaboration.\n\n raises questions about the concept of a nation or national\nidentity, about what it is to belong to a nation, and about how much\none ought to care about one\u2019s nation. Nations and national\nidentity may be defined in terms of common origin, ethnicity, or\ncultural ties, and while an individual\u2019s membership in the\nnation is often regarded as involuntary, it is sometimes regarded as\nvoluntary. The degree of care for one\u2019s nation that nationalists\nrequire is often, but not always, taken to be very high: according to\nsuch views, the claims of one\u2019s nation take precedence over\nrival contenders for authority and\n loyalty.[1]\n raises questions about whether sovereignty requires the\nacquisition of full statehood with complete authority over domestic\nand international affairs, or whether something less than statehood\nsuffices. Although sovereignty is often taken to mean full statehood\n(Gellner 1983: ch.\n 1),[2]\n possible exceptions have been recognized (Miller 1992: 87; Miller\n2000). Some authors even defend an anarchist version of\npatriotism-moderate nationalism foreshadowed by Bakunin (see Sparrow\n2007).\n\n\nThere is a terminological and conceptual question of distinguishing\nnationalism from patriotism. A popular proposal is the contrast\nbetween attachment to one\u2019s country as defining patriotism and\nattachment to one\u2019s people and its traditions as defining\nnationalism (Kleinig 2014: 228, and Primoratz 2017: Section 1.2). One\nproblem with this proposal is that love for a country is not really\njust love of a piece of land but normally involves attachment to the\ncommunity of its inhabitants, and this introduces \u201cnation\u201d\ninto the conception of patriotism. Another contrast is the one between\nstrong, and somewhat aggressive attachment (nationalism) and a mild\none (patriotism), dating back at least to George Orwell (see his 1945\nessay).[3]\n\nDespite these definitional worries, there is a fair amount of\nagreement about the classical, historically paradigmatic form of\nnationalism. It typically features the supremacy of the nation\u2019s\nclaims over other claims to individual allegiance and full sovereignty\nas the persistent aim of its political program. Territorial\nsovereignty has traditionally been seen as a defining element of state\npower and essential for nationhood. It was extolled in classic modern\nworks by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau and is returning to center stage\nin the debate, though philosophers are now more skeptical (see below).\nIssues surrounding the control of the movement of money and people (in\nparticular immigration) and the resource rights implied in territorial\nsovereignty make the topic politically central in the age of\nglobalization and philosophically interesting for nationalists and\nanti-nationalists alike.\n\nIn recent times, the philosophical focus has moved more in the\ndirection of \u201cliberal nationalism\u201d, the view that\nmitigates the classical claims and tries to bring together the\npro-national attitude and the respect for traditional liberal values.\nFor instance, the territorial state as political unit is seen by\nclassical nationalists as centrally \u201cbelonging\u201d to one\nethnic-cultural group and as actively charged with protecting and\npromulgating its traditions. The liberal variety allows for\n\u201csharing\u201d of the territorial state with non-dominant\nethnic groups. Consequences are varied and quite interested (for more\nsee below, especially\n section 2.1).\n",
