Many analysts now agree that discovery processes can be\nregarded as problem solving activities, whereby a discovery is a\nsolution to a problem. Heuristics-based methodologies of discovery are\nneither purely subjective and intuitive nor algorithmic or\nformalizable; the point is that reasons can be given for pursuing one\nor the other problem-solving strategy. These rules are open and do not\nguarantee a solution to a problem when applied (Ippoliti 2018). On\nthis view, scientific researchers are no longer seen as Kuhnian\n\u201cpuzzle solvers\u201d but as problem solvers and decision\nmakers in complex, variable, and changing environments (Wimsatt 2007).\n\n\nPhilosophers of discovery working in this tradition draw on a growing\nbody of literature in cognitive psychology, management science,\noperations research, and economy on human reasoning and decision\nmaking in contexts with limited information, under time constraints,\nand with sub-optimal means (Gigerenzer & Sturm 2012). Heuristic\nstrategies characterized in these studies, such as Gigerenzer\u2019s\n\u201ctools to theory heuristic\u201d are then applied to understand\nscientific knowledge generation (Gigerenzer 1992, Nickles 2018). Other\nanalysts specify heuristic strategies in a range of scientific fields,\nincluding climate science, neurobiology, and clinical medicine\n(Gramelsberger 2011, Schaffner 2008, Gillies 2018). Finally, in\nanalytic epistemology, formal methods are developed to identify and\nassess distinct heuristic strategies currently in use, such as\nBayesian reverse engineering in cognitive science (Zednik and\nJ\u00e4kel 2016). \n\nAs the literature on heuristics continues to grow, it has become clear\nthat the term \u201cheuristics\u201d is itself used in a variety of\ndifferent ways. (For a valuable taxonomy of meanings of\n\u201cheuristic,\u201d see Chow 2015, see also Ippoliti 2018.)\nMoreover, as in the context of earlier debates about computational\nheuristics, debates continue about the limitations of heuristics. The\nuse of heuristics may come at a cost if heuristics introduce\nsystematic biases (Wimsatt 2007). Some philosophers thus call for\ngeneral principles for the evaluation of heuristic strategies (Hey\n2016). \n",
