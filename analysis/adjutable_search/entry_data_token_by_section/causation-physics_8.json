    "main_text": "Interventionist accounts of causation\n3. Interventionist accounts of causation\n\nThe approaches to causation most widely discussed in the philosophical\nliterature in recent decades have been the Bayes net or structural\nmodel accounts of causation developed by Peter Spirtes and his\nco-authors (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993 [2000]) and by Judea\nPearl (2000; 2009). The account\u2019s formal framework is also at\nthe heart of Woodward\u2019s highly influential interventionist\naccount of causation and explanation (Woodward 2003a).\n\nStructural model accounts propose mathematically rigorous and precise\nrepresentations of causal structures. On Pearl\u2019s account, a\nstructural causal model (SCM) consists of a directed acyclic graph\n(representable in terms of a \u201cblobs-and-arrows\u201d diagram)\nover a set of variables \\(V={X, Y, \\ldots}\\) consisting of\n\nendogenous variables \\(V_i\\) and exogenous variables \\(U_i\\);\nstructural equations \\(x_{i} = f_{i}(pa_{i}, u_{i}),\\) which\nspecify the value of each variable \\(x_{i}\\) in terms of the value of\nthe variable\u2019s causal parents \\(pa_{i}\\) and random exogenous\ndisturbances \\(u_{i}\\); and\na probability distribution \\(P(u_{i})\\) over the values \\(u_{i}\\)\nof the exogenous variables \\(U_{i}\\), which induces a probability\ndistribution over all variables.\n\n\nIt is part of the definition of a structural model that the exogenous\nvariables are probabilistically independent of one another (e.g.,\nPearl 2000: 44). From this together with the assumption that a causal\nmodel is complete one can derive the causal Markov condition,\nwhich is a generalized common cause condition and states that for\nevery variable X in V, X is probabilistically\nindependent of the variables in the set \\((V -\n\\textrm{Descendants}(X))\\) conditional on the parents of X.\n\nThere is a debate in the literature to what extent structural model\naccounts can be applied in physics and what implications these\naccounts have for the role of causation in physics. Frisch\n (2014) proposes that we can\nconstruct causal representations of physical systems by identifying\nthe variables characterizing a system\u2019s initial state with the\nexogenous variables in a causal model and the theory\u2019s\nGreen\u2019s functions with the model\u2019s structural equations\n(see also Lloyd 1996).\n\nOne can then use the machinery of structural models to derive a common\ncause principle from the initial randomness assumption. In particular,\nthe initial randomness assumption can be used to break the symmetry\nbetween the retarded and advanced Green\u2019s functions for\nhyperbolic equations: Causal model constructed with retarded\nGreen\u2019s functions as structural equations satisfy the\nprobabilistic independence assumption required in the structural model\nframework, while putatively causal models constructed with\n\u201canti-causal\u201d or advanced Green\u2019s functions violate\nthe probabilistic independence assumption, since in such models the\nhighly correlated variables characterizing a system\u2019s final\nstate functions as exogenous variables. Thus structural model\naccounts may provide an appropriate framework to support the claim that\ncausal inferences and judgments play an important role in physics.\n\nBy contrast, Pearl (2000) and Woodward (2007) point to an aspect of\nstructural causal models that may make the framework fit less well\nwith at least some aspects of theorizing in physics. Structural causal\nmodels make perspicuous the tight connections between the notions of\ncause and intervention or manipulation. A structural causal model\nprovides us with information on how the values of variables change\nunder external interventions into a system, while causal discovery\nalgorithms allow us to construct causal models from information about\nprobability distributions over the values of variables characterizing\nthe system and information about the effects of interventions. On\nWoodward\u2019s account the notion of causation is spelled out in\nterms of so-called \u201chard\u201d or \u201carrow-breaking\u201d\ninterventions. Arrow-breaking interventions allow us to investigate\nhow changes to a variable V percolate through a system, when we\nplace V under the full control of an intervention variable and\nbreak all other causal arrows into V. Yet arrow-breaking\ninterventions may not be possible within the context of certain\nphysical theories. Newtonian gravitational forces, for example, cannot\nbe turned off.\n In reply to this worry one can argue that interventions into\nphysical systems may be more adequately modeled in term of\n\u201csoft\u201d, non-arrow breaking interventions, as investigated\nin Eberhardt and Scheines (2007). What the comparative merits of\ncharacterizing causal structures in terms of \u201chard\u201d or\n\u201csoft\u201d interventions are, is the subject of an ongoing\ndebate.\n\nPearl (2000) also argues that any account of causation that closely\nlinks causal notions and the notion of interventions cannot be applied\nin the context of a truly fundamental physics that includes models of\nthe universe as a whole. The reason is that global models of the\nuniverse as a whole do not have an \u201coutside\u201d that could be\nrepresented by an intervention variable and from which an intervention\ninto the universe could take place. Yet Pearl\u2019s own do-calculus\nfirst introduces interventions formally in a way that does not posit\nintervention variables external to the causal model of interest.\nNonetheless, interventions into the universe as a whole are not\nphysically possible. Here the question concerning interventions in\nfundamental physics makes contact with another issue on which there is\nan active debate: the question on appropriate constraints on allowable\ninterventions and the question to what extent interventions need to be\nphysically or conceptually possible.\n\nTaking a somewhat broader view, the worry concerning global models\narises from a conception of physics that is widely held by\nphilosophers\u2014a conception according to which one of the\nfundamental aims of physics is to present us with global dynamical\nmodels of the dynamical laws that adequately represent the universe as\na whole. The worry then is that causal models, in particular on an\ninterventionist conception of cause, cannot get a foothold within such\na globalist conception of physics. This globalist conception can be\ncontrasted with one according to which the laws of physics are\nunderstood as rules governing localized subsystems of the universe\n(Ismael 2016; see also Cartwright 1999). Defenders of the latter\nconception would argue not only that it can more easily accommodate\ncausal reasoning than the globalist picture but also that it fits the\nday-to-day practice of most of physics considerably better than the\nglobalist conception.\n",
