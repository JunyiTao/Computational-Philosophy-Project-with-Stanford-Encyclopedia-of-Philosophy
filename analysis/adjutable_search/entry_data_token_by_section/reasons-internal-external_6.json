    "main_text": "Indirect, Theoretical Arguments || Arguments from Reactive Attitudes\n2.3 Arguments from Reactive Attitudes\n\n\nAn important part of the debate about internal and external reasons\nhas centered on \u2018reactive attitudes\u2019, or attitudes that we\nhave towards agents in response to their behavior, of which blame is\nthe paradigm. Some have observed in defense of Moral Rationalism,\nfor example, that if an agent does something we consider morally wrong,\nthen we blame (or resent) her. But blame, these philosophers\nclaim, involves the judgment that the agent had reasons not to do what\nhe did. Consequently blame is unwarranted when such judgments are\nunwarranted (Nagel 1970, Smith 1994). Therefore, since moral\nwrongdoing is sufficient to warrant blame, moral obligations must\nentail reasons. Furthermore, Moral Absolutism tells us that the\nmoral wrongness of certain actions is independent of agents\u2019 desires\nand dispositions. Since wrongness entails the appropriateness of\nblame, which in turn entails existence of reasons, we can conclude that\nthere must be reasons that are independent of agents\u2019 desires and\ndispositions: i.e. external reasons.\n\n\nA difficulty for this argument comes from the fact that outside of\nmorality we do not, in general, blame or resent people for failing to\ncomply with their practical reasons. If an agent does something\nfoolish or imprudent, for example, we might react with pity or scorn,\nbut not with anything as strong as blame. It seems that the\nappropriateness of blame requires some condition other than\nnoncompliance with reasons. This does not show that noncompliance\nwith reasons is not one of the necessary conditions for blame, of\ncourse, but it opens the possibility that once we identify the further\nnecessary conditions we might find that they are also, by themselves,\nsufficient conditions for appropriate blame. The internalist\nmight suggest, for example, that the missing condition is partly that\nthe judge have desires or concerns that are harmed by the\nresented behavior. Proponents of the argument from blame may\nrespond that it is inappropriate to blame harmful non-agents (like\ntrees and tigers) and agents whose harms are unintentional.\nHowever it may be possible to excuse these from blame without accepting\nthat noncompliance with reasons is a necessary condition for\nblameworthiness; for example, with the weaker condition that a\nblameworthy act stems from having a character from which certain\nconcerns or motivations are absent (Arpaly 2003). Trees and\ntigers don\u2019t have a \u2018character\u2019 in the relevant\nsense, and harms that an agent causes unintentionally do not stem from\nher character. If something like this is a sufficient condition\nfor blameworthiness, then this argument from reactive attitudes\nfails.\n\n\nBernard Williams does not resist the claim that the appropriateness\nof blame entails reasons, however, and offers a way of explaining the\nappropriateness of blame when an agent appears to have no relevant\ninternal reasons to act otherwise than she did. Blaming in these\ncases functions as a \u2018proleptic mechanism\u2019: it itself\nchanges the situation for the agent so that she now has an internal\nreason that she otherwise would have lacked (1989). This is a\nreason she has in virtue of something like \u2018a disposition to have\nthe respect of other people\u2019. By blaming or being disposed\nto blame an agent for unethical behavior, we give her a reason to act\nethically. Note that this account understands the appropriateness\nof blame as at least partly instrumental. Blaming is appropriate\nif it has some motivational grip on the agent. This view is\nresisted by many who see the question of the appropriateness of a\nreactive attitude as primarily an issue of desert. Arguably,\nblame is appropriate only if it is deserved, and not if it is merely\neffective in influencing people\u2019s behavior.\n\n\nIt is also possible to appeal to reactive attitudes in arguing\nagainst external reasons. Williams argues that\nexternalism cannot accommodate the obscurity and indeterminacy in the\npractice of blame: that is, the pattern predicted by his\ninternalist account that blame sometimes responds to reasons and at\nother times tries to create them, and that its appropriateness turns on\nwhether the agent can be influenced psychologically in either of these\nways.\n\n\nRuss Shafer-Landau finds in Williams\u2019 article the suggestion of a\nfurther argument, turning on the fairness constraint on appropriate\nblame (2003: 181\u20132). Blame is only appropriate if it is fair, and\nit is only fair to blame someone for their behavior if they had the\ncapacity to act otherwise than they did. But an agent\u2019s capacity\nto act is limited by her desires and dispositions, and therefore blame\nis only appropriate if an agent\u2019s desires and dispositions gave her the\ncapacity to act otherwise. This is a challenge for externalism\nbecause of the suggested connection between blame and reasons we\ndiscussed above: an agent is blameworthy for her action only if\nin so acting she failed to obey her\n reasons.[1]\nIt follows that an agent\u2019s\nreasons must be limited by her desires and dispositions; some form of\ninternalism is true.\n\n\nThis argument can succeed only if supported by a plausible version\nof the \u2018ought implies can\u2019 principle. But in basing\nan agent\u2019s capacity to act on her desires and dispositions, the\nversion of the principle that the argument seems to presuppose treats\n\u2018ought\u2019, or the fairness of blame, as depending on the\npsychological capacity to act rather than on the mere\nphysical capacity to act. Externalists would reject as\nimplausible the psychological version of the principle, and therefore\nto assume it for purposes of an internalist argument would be\nquestion-begging against the externalist.\n",
