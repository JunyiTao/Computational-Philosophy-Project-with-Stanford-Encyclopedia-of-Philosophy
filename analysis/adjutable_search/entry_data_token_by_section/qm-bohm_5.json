The Two-Slit Experiment\n\nAccording to Richard Feynman, the two-slit experiment for electrons is\n\n\n\na phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to\nexplain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum\nmechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery. (Feynman,\nLeighton, & Sands 1963: 37\u20132) \n\n\nThis experiment \n\n\nhas been designed to contain all of the mystery of quantum mechanics,\nto put you up against the paradoxes and mysteries and peculiarities of\nnature one hundred per cent. (Feynman 1967: 130) \n\n\nAs to the question, \n\n\nHow does it really work? What machinery is actually producing this\nthing? Nobody knows any machinery. Nobody can give you a deeper\nexplanation of this phenomenon than I have given; that is, a\ndescription of it. (Feynman 1967: 145) \n\n\nBut Bohmian mechanics is just such a deeper explanation. It resolves\nin a rather straightforward manner the dilemma of the appearance of\nboth particle and wave properties in one and the same phenomenon:\nBohmian mechanics is a theory of motion describing a particle (or\nparticles) guided by a wave. Here we have a family of Bohmian\ntrajectories for the two-slit experiment.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An ensemble of trajectories\nfor the two-slit experiment, uniform in the slits.\n\n(adapted by Gernot Bauer from Philippidis, Dewdney, & Hiley 1979:\n23, fig. 3)\n\n\nWhile each trajectory passes through only one slit, the wave passes\nthrough both; the interference profile that therefore develops in the\nwave generates a similar pattern in the trajectories guided by the\nwave.\n\nCompare Feynman\u2019s presentation with Bell\u2019s:\n\n\nIs it not clear from the smallness of the scintillation on the screen\nthat we have to do with a particle? And is it not clear, from the\ndiffraction and interference patterns, that the motion of the particle\nis directed by a wave? De Broglie showed in detail how the motion of a\nparticle, passing through just one of two holes in screen, could be\ninfluenced by waves propagating through both holes. And so influenced\nthat the particle does not go where the waves cancel out, but is\nattracted to where they cooperate. This idea seems to me so natural\nand simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and\nordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so\ngenerally ignored. (Bell [1989] 1987c: 191) \n\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling aspect of the two-slit experiment is the\nfollowing: If, by any means whatsoever, it is possible to determine\nthe slit through which the particle passes, the interference pattern\nwill be destroyed. This dramatic effect of observation is, in fact, a\nsimple consequence of Bohmian mechanics. To see this, one must\nconsider the meaning of determining the slit through which the\nparticle passes. This must involve interaction with another system\nthat the Bohmian mechanical analysis must include.\n\nThe destruction of interference is related, naturally enough, to the\nBohmian mechanical analysis of quantum measurement (Bohm 1952). It\noccurs via the mechanism that in Bohmian mechanics leads to the\n \u201ccollapse of the wave function\u201d.\n\nFor an accessible presentation of the behavior of Bohmian trajectories\nin scattering and tunneling phenomena, see Norsen 2013.\n",
