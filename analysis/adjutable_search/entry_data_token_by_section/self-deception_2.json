    "main_text": "Intentionalist Approaches || Temporal Partitioning\n2.1 Temporal Partitioning\n\nSome intentionalists argue that self-deception is a complex,\ntemporally extended process during which a self-deceiver can\nconsciously set out to deceive herself that p, knowing or\nbelieving that ~p, and along the way lose her belief that\n~p, either forgetting her original deceptive intention\nentirely or regarding it as having, albeit accidentally, brought about\nthe true belief she would have arrived at anyway (Sorensen 1985;\nBerm\u00fadez 2000). So, for instance, an official involved in some\nillegal behavior might destroy any records of this behavior and create\nevidence that would cover it up (diary entries, emails, and the like),\nknowing that she will likely forget having done these things over the\nnext few months. When her activities are investigated a year later,\nshe has forgotten her tampering efforts and, based upon her falsified\nevidence, comes to believe falsely that she was not involved in the\nillegal activities of which she is accused. Here, the self-deceiver\nneed never simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs even though she\nintends to bring it about that she believes that p, which she\nregards as false at the outset of the process of deceiving herself and\ntrue at its completion.\n\nThe self-deceiver need not even forget her original intention to\ndeceive. Take an atheist who sets out to get herself to believe in God\nbecause it seems the best bet if God turns out to exist. She might\nwell remember such an intention at the end of the process and deem\nthat by God\u2019s grace even this misguided path led her to the\ntruth. What enables the intention to succeed in such cases is the\noperation of what Johnston (1988) terms \u2018autonomous means\u2019\n(e.g., the normal degradation of memory, the tendency to believe what\none practices, etc.), not the continued awareness of the intention,\nhinting that the process may be subintentional (See\n \u00a73.1 Revision of Intention).\n\nWhile such temporal partitioning accounts appear to avoid the static\nand dynamic paradoxes, many, if not most, cases of self-deception\naren\u2019t of this temporally extended type. Regularly,\nself-deception seems to occur instantaneously (Jordan 2022), as when a\nphilosopher self-deceives that her article is high quality even while\nreading the substantive and accurate criticisms in the rejection\nletter from the prestigious peer-reviewed journal she submitted it to\n(example due to Mele 2001). Additionally, many of these temporally\nextended cases lack the distinctive opacity, indirection, and tension\nassociated with garden-variety cases of self-deception (Levy\n2004).\n",
