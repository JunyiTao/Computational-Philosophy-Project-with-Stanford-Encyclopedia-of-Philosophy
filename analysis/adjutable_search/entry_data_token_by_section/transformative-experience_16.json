Applied Ethics: In Light of Transformation, How Should We Treat Others?\n\nTransformative experiences also demand that we revisit how we treat\nothers in light of the fact that they potentially may undergo\ntransformative experiences. As seen in\n \u00a71,\n transformation may arise in many contexts, far too many to attempt to\ntackle here. Instead, this section will focus on three types of\ncontexts in which the issue of how we should treat others given the\npossibility of transformation might arise: when we choose for others,\nwhen we make long-term decisions involving others, and when we create\nenvironments that (dis)favor transformation.\n",
