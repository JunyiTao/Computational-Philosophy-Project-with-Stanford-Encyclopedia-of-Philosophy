    "main_text": "\n\nAfter presenting the current situation of epistemological research in\nLatin America and part of its history, this entry will address six\ntopics: skepticism (especially in its Pyrrhonian stripe), core\nepistemology, formal epistemology, Wittgenstein\u2019s thought in\nconnection with epistemology and skepticism, epistemology of law, and\nreligious epistemology. It should be noted from the outset that the\nentry does not purport to provide a comprehensive account of\nepistemology in Latin America, but rather to paint a general picture\nof it by focusing on the main issues that have been discussed within\nthat field.\n\nWe will take into consideration the work of those scholars who have\nwritten (in Spanish, Portuguese, or English) on epistemological issues\nindependently of both whether they are currently based in Latin\nAmerica and whether they have worked in a non-Latin American country\nfor a considerable part of their careers. The touchstone for inclusion\nwas not whether they were born in Latin America\u2014although all but\none of those who will be mentioned were born there\u2014but whether\nthey are of Latin American origin, earned a degree from a Latin\nAmerican university, and worked for at least some time in Latin\nAmerica, thus receiving (part of) their philosophical education in\nsuch a milieu. For this reason, there will be no mention of, e.g.,\nErnesto Sosa\u2019s and Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff\u2019s extensive\nand influential work in\n epistemology.[1]\n",
