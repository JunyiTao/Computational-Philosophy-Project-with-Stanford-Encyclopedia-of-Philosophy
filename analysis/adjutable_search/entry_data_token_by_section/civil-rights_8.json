    "main_text": "The Right to Vote || The Voting Rights Act\n4.2 The Voting Rights Act\n\nAmong the most effective and important pieces of legislation to come\nout of the Civil Rights Movement was the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n(VRA). The act effected a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (Davidson and\nGrofman 1994) in the political systems of southern states by greatly\nreducing the legal power those states had traditionally enjoyed to\ndetermine the rules by which their electoral systems operated. The\nbroad consensus among historians and political scientists is that the\nVRA put an end to the massive disenfranchisement of southern blacks,\nas black voter registration rates increased exponentially across\nSouthern states in just a few years after enactment (Wright 2013:\n183). Additionally, studies have shown that, with the help of\npersistent litigation based on the act, the number of black elected\nofficials, especially at the local level, increased substantially\n(184). In his assessment of the effects of the VRA, Wright concludes\nthat \u201cit is undeniable that local political participation [by\nblacks] generated positive change in aspects important to [their]\ncommunities and their members \u2026 . [b]y ensuring that gains from\neconomic growth would be more broadly shared\u201d than would\notherwise have been the case (184). Those gains included the provision\nof basic public services that many black communities in the South had\nbeen previously denied due to discrimination, services such as paved\nroads, streetlights, fire stations, and sewage treatment\nfacilities.\n\nThe VRA took a series of unprecedented steps in shifting the power to\nregulate elections from the states to the national government. The\ntraditional understanding had been that, under the Constitution,\nstates had the exclusive and final power to determine the rules by\nwhich elections for state and local offices were held. The VRA\noverturned that understanding, inserting federal power into the\nsovereign domain of the states. \n\nSection 2 of the VRA contained a nationwide ban on any voting\nqualification or procedure that denied or abridged a citizen\u2019s\nright to vote on account of race or color. The act went on to provide\nremedies to make the ban effective in jurisdictions that had been\nparticularly egregious in their violations of the 15th Amendment. The\nremedies applied to jurisdictions that met two conditions (the\n\u201ccoverage formula\u201d): 1) as of November 1964, the\njurisdiction was using a literacy test or some similar device to\ndetermine eligibility to register, and 2) the proportion of eligible\nvoters in the jurisdiction who were registered on that date, or who\nhad turned out to vote in the election that year, was below 50%. The\nidea was that low overall registration or voting rates (under 50%) was\nan objective indicator that a sizeable proportion of the eligible\nvoters were being denied access to the ballot for racially\ndiscriminatory reasons. Measures authorized for use against\njurisdictions that met the coverage formula included the invalidation\nof literacy tests, the appointment of federal examiners to replace\nlocal registrars and to compile the voting rolls, and, under Section\n5, the requirement to gain federal approval (typically from the\nAttorney General) for any changes in rules governing elections\n(\u201cthe preclearance requirement\u201d). Seven southern states\nfell under the coverage formula. \n\nThe constitutionality of the key provisions of the VRA was challenged\nby the states that fell under the formula, but the Supreme Court\nupheld the law in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). The\nact was then reauthorized several times with some alterations. The\nalterations sought to strengthen protections against what were called\n\u201csecond- generation\u201d barriers to racial equality in the\nelectoral process. The first generation had included literacy tests\nand the other devices that were applied in discriminatory fashion to\nblock blacks from registering. The second generation consisted of\nvarious ways that the political power of registered minority voters\nwas diluted by electoral arrangements. \n\nConsider the following example of vote dilution. In many counties in\nthe South, whites were in the overall majority but blacks were a\nmajority in certain parts of the county. The counties had been\ntraditionally divided into districts, with each district electing a\nmember of the county board. First-generation discrimination ensured\nall-white boards by blocking black registration in majority-black\ndistricts. When first-generation devices were invalidated as a result\nof the VRA, many southern counties switched from a district-based\nsystem to at-large voting, so that the white majority in the county as\na whole could continue to elect an all-white board. The Supreme Court\nheld that such changes were subject to a preclearance review by\nfederal authorities, who were empowered to prohibit the changes\n(Allen v. State Board of Elections 1969). And treating\ndilution as a form of racial discrimination, in 1982, Congress amended\nsection 2 to prohibit any electoral rule or arrangement that\n\u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen\nof the United States to vote on account of race or color \u2026 .\n[or being] a member of a language minority group\u201d (52 U.S.C.\n10301 and 10303).\n\nFor more than four decades, the preclearance requirement of section 5\nand litigation based on section 2 were used to stop racial vote\ndilution and a range of other electoral arrangements that were deemed\nracially discriminatory. Then the Supreme Court upended preclearance\nin its ruling in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). \n",
