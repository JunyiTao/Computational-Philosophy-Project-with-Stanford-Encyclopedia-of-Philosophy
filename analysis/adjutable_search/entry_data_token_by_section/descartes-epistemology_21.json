    "main_text": "Self-Knowledge || That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n9.2 Whether We Perfectly Know Our Own Minds\n\nWe have seen that the proper use of our cognitive faculties requires\nus to withhold assent except when our perception is clear and distinct\n\u2013 indeed, that forming judgments in accord with the C&D Rule\nprovides the only guarantee of truth. Let\u2019s apply this standard\nto introspective judgments. Suppose that the present contents of my \nmind include a confused array of ideas \u2013 say, a confused \nassemblage of auditory ideas, or color ideas, or perhaps I am\npresently flooded with a confused assortment of ideas of emotion.\nIn such cases, the proper use of my faculties requires me to withhold \njudgment about the present state of my mind.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to learn that on the standard view in\nDescartes scholarship, he holds a strong view of privileged access\nguaranteeing the truth of all introspective judgments about\nthe present contents of our own minds. The usual result is an\ninfallibility thesis whereby judgments about our own mental states\ncannot be mistaken if based on introspective awareness: if\nI seem to be in mental state x, then I am\nin x. (A variety of related doctrines are also sometimes\nattributed to him, including the indubitability of the mental\n\u2013 roughly, that introspective judgments are indubitable;\nand omniscience with respect to the mental \u2013 roughly,\nthat one has knowledge of every true proposition about one\u2019s own\npresent contents of consciousness. There is some variation in the way\nthese doctrines are formulated in the literature.)\n\nAt least two lines of argument are widely cited in support of this\nstandard interpretation. One draws on the transparency doctrine. The\nother draws on texts interpreted as providing support. Let\u2019s \nexamine both.\n\nThe transparency doctrine has it that we are aware of everything\noccurring in our minds \u2013 this, a result of Descartes\u2019 view\nthat thinking constitutes the whole essence of\nmind:\n\nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware, this seems to me to be\nself-evident. For there is nothing that we can understand to be in the\nmind, regarded in this way, that is not a thought or dependent on a\nthought. \u2026 and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware at the very moment when it is in us. (Replies 4, AT 7:246, CSM\n2:171f)\n\n\nAdd to this that, unlike with external sensation, there is no\nintrospective appearance/reality gap, and there can seem to be no room\nfor introspective errors. Zeno Vendler explains:\n\nIf the mind, at any given time, is identical with a certain complex of\nthoughts \u2026 then the very idea of a medium between the\nmind and its thoughts is impossible from the outset. Accordingly, it\nis an understatement to say that the mind knows its thoughts;\nthe mind is these thoughts. (1972, 191)\n\n\nKenny adds:\n\nThe occurrence of thoughts is not open to doubt or error. Thoughts\ncannot occur without our knowing that they occur, and we cannot think\nthat a thought is occurring unless that thought actually is occurring.\n(1968, 72)\n\n\nIn opposition to this standard interpretation, note that from the\nfact that I have awareness of whatever is occurring in my mind, it\ndoes not follow that I have distinct awareness. If\nwhat\u2019s occurring in my mind is a confused muddle of ideas, then\nI\u2019ll be aware of a confused muddle of ideas. But in that case,\nforming a judgment about the present state of my mind is a recipe for\nerror \u2013 i.e., given the Fourth Meditation account of proper\njudgment. The situation is arguably better in cases in which I\nam experiencing fewer and simpler ideas; this is because such ideas\nare generally easier to render clear and distinct. Even so, such\nideas must actually be rendered as clear and distinct.\nNoteworthy is that Descartes writes, of \u201csensations, emotions\nand appetites,\u201d that \u201cwe are frequently wrong in our \njudgements concerning them\u201d; adding, that we can avoid such\nerrors \u201cprovided we take great care in our judgements\nconcerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained\nin our perception \u2013 no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness\u201d (Prin 1:66, AT 8a:32, CSM 1:216).\n\nConsider another case that seems at odds with the standard\ninterpretation. Were Descartes committed to introspective\ninfallibility, then he should say that we could never\nbe mistaken as to whether our occurring ideas are ideas of\nsensation, or instead ideas of imagination\noccurring in a dream. Yet as we\u2019ve seen, he takes\ndreaming-based scepticism utterly seriously.\n\nWhat about the textual line of argument regularly cited in support\nof the standard interpretation? Consider two Meditations\npassages that can seem to entail the infallibility thesis:\n\n\nI certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This\ncannot be false; what is called \u201chaving a sensory\nperception\u201d is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense\nof the term it is simply thinking. (Med. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19)\n\nNow as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely\nin themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot\nstrictly speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that\nI am imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the\nlatter. As for the will and the emotions, here too one need not worry\nabout falsity; for even if the things which I may desire are wicked or\neven non-existent, that does not make it any less true that I desire\nthem. (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nPrima facie, it is plausible to take such passages to entail that if\nI seem to be having an idea of blue, or an idea of a noise,\nor of warmth, etc., then I am. Indeed, one might take such\npassages to convey that judgments to this effect \u201ccannot be\nfalse\u201d because introspective judgments are infallible.\nBut note the continuation of the second passage: \u201cThus the only\nremaining thoughts where I must be on my guard against making a\nmistake are judgements.\u201d This suggests that these passages can\nbe read in a very different way. Accordingly, a mere seeming\n\u201ccannot be false\u201d because it is not the kind of mental\nstate that could be false; on Descartes\u2019 view,\nfalsity arises not simply from the mind\u2019s awareness\nof its ideas, but from judgments \u2013 i.e., from acts of will \nassenting to those items of awareness. Read in this way, these\npassages anticipate the Fourth Meditation theory of judgment:\n\nNow all that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive the ideas\nwhich are subjects for possible judgements; and when regarded strictly\nin this light, it turns out to contain no error in the proper sense of\nthat term. (AT 7:56, CSM 2:39)\n\n\nArguably, Descartes\u2019 mind-better-known-than-body\ndoctrine is intended as a comparative rather than a\nsuperlative thesis. We have seen that, for Descartes, the\nonly superlative perceptual state is that of clarity and distinctness.\nThis suggests that the only guarantee of truth in our introspective \njudgments is, like all other judgments, that they be based on clear \nand distinct perception: if I clearly and distinctly perceive myself\nto be in mental state x, then I am in x.\n\n(For further discussion of related issues in Descartes, see Alanen \n2003, Broughton 2008, Curley 2006, Jolley 2013, Kenny 1968,\nLoLordo 2005, McRae 1972, Newman 2023, Nolan & Whipple 2005,\nVendler 1972, and Wilson 1978.)\n",
