    "main_text": "\n\n\nAlthough Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936) made a lasting mark in the\nphilosophical memory by his role as the nominal leader of the Vienna\nCircle of Logical Positivists, his most lasting contribution includes\na broad range of philosophical achievements. Indeed, Schlick\u2019s\nreputation was established well before the Circle went public. In\n1917, he published Space and Time in Contemporary Physics, a\nphilosophical introduction to the new physics of Relativity which was\nhighly acclaimed by Einstein himself as well as many others. The\nfollowing year, the first edition of his influential General\nTheory of Knowledge appeared and, in 1922, he was appointed to\nthe prestigious chair of Naturphilosophie at the University\nof Vienna. Upon his arrival at his new post, he immediately began to\ncollaborate with the mathematician Hans Hahn, the sociologist and\neconomist Otto Neurath, forming a discussion group known as the\n\u2018Schlick Zirkel\u2019. In the 1930s, the intellectual\nenergy of the Circle was increased by newcomers like Rudolf Carnap and\nKurt G\u00f6del, as well as the outside influences of thinkers from\nAmerica (Ernest Nagel, W. V. O. Quine), Britain (A. J.  Ayer), Poland\n(Alfred Tarski), and Germany (Hans Reichenbach), put Schlick in the\nmidst of a virtual whirlwind of philosophical activity which deepened,\nbroadened, and matured his thinking. As his international fame grew,\nSchlick found himself lecturing in London, teaching at Stanford, and\nreceiving offers to join the faculties of prestigious universities\nboth at home and abroad. At the same time, he produced a number of\nessays which exerted a deep and lasting influence on contemporary\nthought. But Schlick\u2019s life was cut short by an assassin\u2019s\nbullets in 1936, much to the loss of the intellectual world.\n",
