    "main_text": "The Buddhist account of the emotions || \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita on love and hatred\n4.2 \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita on love and hatred\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that love and hatred exist due to\nhabit and repetition which is ascertained by confirming and\ndisconfirming concomitance. This means that they are learned through\nexperience. For example, love is learned by a person being confronted\nwith objects to which this feeling is attributed and thus reinforced\nthe more of these objects a person encounters. However, we can observe\nthe existence of love and hatred in babies who have not had the\nrepeated experience of these objects in this life.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita claims that the existence of love and\nhatred cannot be due to the first encounter with the object of love or\nhatred because it would be possible, as indeed happens according to\nhim, to encounter this object without the respective feelings of love\nor hatred or to encounter it with another feeling, such as disgust. As\nan example, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita mentions the attraction a man\nmight feel towards a woman. He claims that men are attracted to women\nif they also attribute \u201cgoodness\u201d and\n\u201cdevotedness\u201d to them, even though a particular woman\nmight not possess these qualities. So the qualities that make, for\nexample, a woman \u201clovable\u201d do not have to exist in the\nwoman and therefore, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the\nwoman cannot be said to be the cause of the feeling of love in the\nman. Love, then is not an object of the senses\n(vi\u1e63aya). Therefore, the reason why these feelings\nexist is through force of habit in previous lives. We have learned\nover time that women are \u201clovable\u201d. This argument is meant\nto demonstrate that love and hatred could not exist if the\nmaterialists were right and mental life was simply the result of\nbodily processes.\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla explains this argument in his commentary on TS\n1948\u20131953 in a rather straightforward way and adds a very\nhelpful example:\n\nFor the following reason also, the feelings of Love, etc. cannot be\ndue to presence of the excitants:\u2013Because, if the feelings\nappeared exactly in accordance with the excitants, they would proceed\nfrom the excitant exactly in the same manner as the Cognition of Blue\nand other things (which always proceeds in accordance with these\nthings);\u2013the feelings however do not proceed in this way; on the\ncontrary, the said feelings appear in regard to the Woman and other\nthings, in men who attribute to the woman the form of their own\nlasting pleasure, etc. which have not been experienced at all; and yet\nthe objects (woman, etc.) are not actually possessed of the said form\nof goodness, etc.;\u2013and when a thing is devoid of a certain form,\nit cannot be the excitant or basis of the Cognition of that form;\notherwise it would lead to absurdity. (TSP: 931)\n\n\nIn this passage, Kamala\u015b\u012bla draws a distinction between the\ncognition of blue and the feeling of love. His point is that the\ncognition of blue is a perception and therefore requires an object\nwhereas a feeling of love does not. There is no basis for love in the\nway that there is a basis for our perception of blue. So,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument, as explained by\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, consists of two parts: a) love, hatred etc. are\nlearned through experience and reinforced by repetition and b) love,\nhatred etc. are not perceptions.\n\nIn TS 1958, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita provides a similar example of\nmale animals that become \u201cperturbed\u201d by the touch of\nfemale animals even though they do not know anything about any\n\u201cdoings\u201d (v\u1e5btt\u0101nta) or sexual\nintercourse, yet. His argument is that this feeling must be due to\nexperiences in previous lives. He does not account for the possibility\nof instinctual behaviour. If \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita allowed for\nthe existence of instinctual behaviour then his observation of babies\nand animals might have let him to believe that love and hatred are\nmental phenomena that are not learned through experience.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita clearly believes that there is something\nfundamental about the feelings of love and hatred. They are so\nfundamental that even babies feel them. At the same time, they require\nexperience. So the question is how was the first feeling of love (or\nhatred) acquired? There might have been a time when humans did not\nhave the feeling of love and they only acquired it at some point in\ntheir lives through experience and subsequent repetition of the\nexperience. This sounds like a strange idea precisely because love and\nhatred are so fundamental to our unenlightened lives that the\nexistence of a time when they did not exist seems impossible. Yet,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s view implies either that there\nmust have been such a time or that there is an infinite chain of these\nfeelings stretching backwards. In TS 1872,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita makes it clear that he believes in the\nlatter option:\n\nAs regards the \u201cother world\u201d, there is no such\n\u201cother world\u201d, apart from the \u201cchain of causes and\neffects, in the form of cognition and the rest\u201d. What is spoken\nof as \u201cthe other world\u201d or \u201cthis world\u201d, that\nis only by way of a certain limit placed upon the said\n\u201cchain\u201d which is beginningless and endless. (TS 1872)\n\n\nSo, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita might argue that love and hatred are\njust as much part of a \u201cchain of cognitions\u201d that is\nwithout beginning and end as all other cognitions. The reason why he\npostulates the existence of this eternal \u201cchain of\ncognitions\u201d is the argument that no cognition could be caused by\nanything other than a previous cognition and hence there cannot be a\nfirst cognition for anything we call a particular being. If there was\na first cognition for a particular being then, according to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (TS 1878\u20131885), there would be five\noptions: i) the first cognition does not have a cause; ii) it is\nproduced by an eternal cause; iii) it is eternal and unchanging; iv)\nit is caused by another substance; and v) it is caused by a cognition\n\u201cfrom another chain\u201d.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita rejects the first option because he\nargues that according to this idea the foetus would somehow receive\nthe first cognition without any cause. This means that the cognition\nwould be eternal, rather than momentary. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nrejects the second option because if the cognition is produced by an\neternal non-material cause then it should itself be eternal. The\nargument is that if something which exists eternally can bring about a\ncognition then there is no point in time at which this cause could\nhave brought about the effect. So the effect is eternal in the same\nway as the cause. But an eternal effect cannot exist because something\nwhich is eternal does not have a cause. The third option that the\ncognition is eternal runs counter to our experience which tells us\nthat cognitions are momentary. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita also\ndismisses the Lok\u0101yata position that cognitions are produced by\nphysical substances because the Lok\u0101yata philosophers argue that\nmaterial substances are eternal. So, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nmakes a similar argument to the rejection of option two. An eternal\ncause has to have an eternal effect but cognitions are not eternal.\nOption five is rejected in TS 1893\u20131896 where\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that the first cognition of one\nchain cannot be solely caused by a cognition from another chain\nbecause in that case we would expect the knowledge of parents to carry\nover into their babies.\n\nThe second part (b) of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument,\nthat love and hatred are different from perception, is intriguing in\nthat he claims that there cannot be an external cause for love and\nhatred because whatever we might want to postulate as this external\nobject can elicit different feelings in different people. The object\nof one person\u2019s love might be the object of another\nperson\u2019s aversion. For this reason, love and hatred cannot be\nacquired in this life, like perceptions. So the love and hatred that\nexist in a baby or young animal must be carried over from another\nlife. This argument assumes that there could not be non-perceptual\ncognition that can arise without previous experience and therefore\nfaces the same challenges as the claim that all feelings have to be\nlearned through repeated experience. But it goes beyond this\ndiscussion in that it raises the question of what the object of love\nand hatred is. Kamala\u015b\u012bla uses the term va\u015ba\n(desire, love) rather than r\u0101ga in his commentary on TS\n1948\u20131953 which suggests that he does not clearly distinguish\nbetween desire and love. If it is true that r\u0101ga is a\nkle\u015ba then it is plausible that there is no distinction\nbetween love and craving. So he could be making the obvious point that\nwe can desire something without a basis in the external world, i.e.,\nwhat I desire might not exist, or that I might desire something for\nthe wrong reasons. Love, hatred and desire all require the existence\nof an object. However, unlike a perceptual object, the objects of love\nand desire can be \u201cmerely\u201d mental. I can love the idea of\nequality or I can desire something which does not exist. This\n\u201cnon-existence\u201d can be two-fold: i) I can desire something\nwhich cannot exist either logically or physically, for example, I can\ndesire that I had wings; ii) if I desire something to be the case,\nthen what I desire does not exist, yet. For example, if I desire an\nice-cream then the state of affairs in which I have an ice-cream does\nnot exist, yet. In contrast with love and desire, perception, at least\non a realist account, requires its object to exist in the external\nworld.\n",
