    "main_text": "Art as Interlocutor\n1. Art as Interlocutor\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics fosters an attentiveness towards the\nmystery of the given and its unexpected folds of meaningfulness.\nGadamer\u2019s arguments are varied, ushering the reader towards an\naesthetic attentiveness rather than making iconoclastic declarations\nabout what the aesthetic is. They embrace close readings of the poets\nRilke and Celan as well as broad strategic manoeuvres which defend the\ncognitive status of aesthetic and hermeneutical judgements.\nHermeneutics (the art and discipline of interpretation), of which\nGadamer is one of the twentieth century\u2019s most formidable\nexponents, is deeply involved in philosophical disputes over the\nlegitimacy of claims to understanding in the visual and literary arts.\nIt does not oppose \u201cscientific\u201d modes of knowledge but\nresists their cultural privileging. For Gadamer aesthetics stands on\nexperientially accumulative modes of learning (Bildung) which\norientate and ground sound judgement in the arts. Conversation and its\nunpredictable turns is, appropriately, a central thread within\nhermeneutical aesthetics. A late exchange between Carsten Dutt and\nGadamer (Dutt 1993, 61\u201367) offers a gentle point of entry into\nhow philosophical hermeneutics approaches art and aesthetic\nexperience.\n\nGadamer insists that a picture or image that is worthy of being called\na work of art, has the power to affect us immediately. (GW 8, 374).\nArt addresses us. The claim that a work of art \u201csays something\nto someone\u201d (Palmer 2001, 70) alludes to the surprise, shock\nand, sometimes, dismay at being directly affected by what is in a work\nand of being forced to reflect on its claim so that it becomes more\nunderstandable to both oneself and others. Gadamer argues that\n\u201cthe experience of art is an experience of meaning, and as such\nthis experience is something that is brought about by\nunderstanding\u201d (Palmer 2001, 70). To this extent, then,\n\u201caesthetics is absorbed into hermeneutics\u201d (Palmer 2001,\n76). This distances Gadamer from more conventional justifications of\nthe aesthetic as offering a special kind of pleasure. The essay\n\u201cThe Play of Art\u201d\u00a0suggests that \u201cthe mere\nonlooker who indulges in aesthetic or cultural enjoyment from a safe\ndistance, whether in the theatre, the concert hall, or the seclusion\nof solitary reading, simply does not exist\u201d (RB 129\u2013130).\nA person who takes himself to be such an onlooker, misunderstands\nhimself. \u201cAesthetic self-understanding is indulging in escapism\nif it regards the encounter with the work of art as nothing but\nenchantment in the sense of liberation from the pressures of reality\nthrough the enjoyment of a spurious freedom\u201d (RB 130). These\nremarks divorce Gadamer\u2019s thinking from Dilthey\u2019s\nErlebnis-\u00c4sthetik in which artworks are proclaimed the\nsite of intense but momentary experience enjoyed for their own sake\nindependent of their cognitive content. The hedonistic personalisation\nof aesthetic response has two alienating consequences. On the one\nhand, the judgement that aesthetic experience is purely subjective\nsevers the individual from communal networks of meaning capable of\nilluminating personal experience from the perspective of what is\nsocially shared. On the other, attempts to render subjective\nexperience academically legitimate by presenting it as a social\nproduct further estrange the individual from his experience, by\ntranslating it into third-person terms he or she may not endorse or\nrecognise: individual experiences of beauty can suddenly become\nembodiments of class prejudice. In contrast to Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911), Gadamer defends an\nErfahrung-\u00c4sthetik, which claims that like significant\nlife-experiences, our relationships with artworks are deep and\nongoing: we revisit them,\u00a0and, in doing so, understanding is\ncontinually renegotiated. Gadamer speaks of the\n\u201cinterminability\u201d of such experience (die\nUnabschliessbarkeit aller Erfahrung, Palmer 2001, 66). It is\nforever open because of its cognitive movement. The cumulative nature\nof such experience is an instance of Bildung (formation and\nlearning through experience) and is, as such, a living process of\nbecoming (Werden).\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics is, in many respects, strictly anti-Kantian\nand yet is influenced by Kant\u2019s insights. Regarding its\nanti-Kantian aspects, it abjures phenomenalist disinterestedness for\nthe sake of phenomenological involvement. It is also anti-idealist. It\nrefuses the idea that in aesthetic experience we perceive \u201ca\npure integration of meaning.\u201d His aesthetics is consequently\nanti-representationalist. There is in the artwork something which\nGadamer describes as its resistance to integration, to being reduced\nto a concept (Palmer 2001, 25). He contends that Hegel\u2019s\ndefinition of the beautiful as the \u201csensuous appearing of the\nIdea\u201d presumes that aesthetic experience is able to reach beyond\nthe specific type of appearance to its underlying idea. In this model,\naesthetic experience becomes the expectation of a semantic fulfilment.\nOnce the idea behind the appearance is grasped, \u201cthe whole of\nits meaning would have been understood once and for all and thus\n\u2018brought in to our possession so to speak\u2019\u201d (Palmer\n2001, 71). The work of art becomes a carrier of meaning to be\nabandoned once the lead story has been grasped. But, Gadamer argues,\n\u201cour understanding of artworks is manifestly not of this type.\nEveryone knows this from his or her own encounters with art, from\nconcerts, visits to museums, and from his or her reading\u201d\n(Palmer 2001, 71). This denial of idealist aesthetics is at the basis\nof his claim that an artwork is essentially enigmatic.\n\nGadamer\u2019s opposition to aesthetic idealism is supported by the\nclaim that art \u201ccannot be satisfactorily translated in terms of\nconceptual knowledge\u201d (RB 69). A work does not simply refer to a\nmeaning which is independent of itself. Its meaning is not to be\ngrasped in such a way that that it can be simply transferred to\nanother idiom. Indeed, because it invites many interpretations, an\nartwork acquires an ideality of possible meanings which cannot be\nobviated by any possible realisation (RB 146). The work has,\ntherefore, an autonomy which cannot be substituted by anything else\nor, to put it another way, the work is always in excess of its\nreadings, its meanings are always more than its interpretations. This\nis congruent with Gadamer\u2019s theses that Being exceeds knowing\nand, similarly, that linguistic Being transcends linguistic\nconsciousness.\n\nAn important consequence arises from this, namely, Gadamer conceives\nart as presentational (darstellen) rather than\nrepresentational (vorstellen). In the essay \u201cWord and\nPicture\u201d (1992), he claims that he tries \u201cto undermine the\nidea that the picture is a mere copy\u201d (GW 8, 374). As a work\ndoes not represent anything other than itself, the meanings it carries\ncan only come to the fore in its self-presentation. Yet the emergent\nmeaning is never given in its entirety nor obviated by any\nrealization. This is consistent with the eventual nature of\nart. \u201cWhen a work of art truly takes hold of us, it is not an\nobject that stands opposite us which we look at in hope of seeing\nthrough it to an intended conceptual meaning \u2026 The work is an\nEreigniss\u2014an event that \u2018appropriates us\u2019\nto itself. It jolts us, it knocks us over and sets up a world of its\nown, into which we are drawn\u201d (Palmer 2001, 71). What is\nrevealed, however, remains but an aspect of the work, which when it\nappears, drives others into the background. Disclosure and hiddenness\nare not contraries in Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics, but mutually\ndependent: the disclosed reveals the presence of the undisclosed in\nthe disclosed. \u201cIt is in the sheer being there\n(Da-sein) of the work of art that our understanding\nexperiences the depths and the unfathomability of its meaning\u201d\n(Palmer 2001, 72). The claim that a work\u2019s meaning can never be\ncompletely fulfilled is supported by a linguistic analogy concerning\nthe speculative. Art has a language in that its signs and symbols\nfunction like semantic units. Gadamer comments on the living\nvirtuality of meaning contained in each word, as an inner dimension of\nmultiplication. Accordingly, language is not the representation\n(mimesis) of a set of pre-given meanings but a \u201ccoming\nto language\u201d of a constant reserve of meanings (Palmer 2001,\n67). The finitude of linguistic expression is such that no utterance\ncan be complete. Nothing comes forth in one meaning that is simply\noffered us (PH 103). \u201cThe only thing that constitutes language\n\u2026 is that one word leads to another, each word is, so to speak,\nsummoned, and on its side holds open the further progress of\nspeaking\u201d (Palmer 2001, 67). No meaning can be completely\nrevealed. Because we can re-visit artworks repeatedly, the meaning\ndisclosed initially can be expanded or changed. The partial nature of\nany given meaning-disclosure enhances rather than diminishes\nthe possibility of meaning within a work. \u201cThe work of art\nconsists in its being open in a limitless way to ever new integrations\nof meaning\u201d (PH 98) and furthermore, \u201cthe inexhaustibility\nthat distinguishes the language of art from all translation into\nconcepts rests on an excess of meaning\u201d (PH 102).\n\nGadamer\u2019s conversation on aesthetics paints its bolder themes:\nart is interrogative by nature, artworks work through a\ndisclosure of meaning, disclosures of meaning establish art\u2019s\ncognitive status, the cognitive content of art is partly intelligible\nand partly enigmatic, and artworks are always open to\nre-interpretation. These are, however, not free-standing arguments.\nGadamer\u2019s position is hermeneutical not because of an underlying\nthesis which goes unremarked but because it is informed by a\nconstellation of various arguments which shape the central position.\nTo the broader arguments we now turn.\n",
