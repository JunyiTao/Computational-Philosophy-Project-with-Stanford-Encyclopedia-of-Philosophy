    "main_text": "Neo-Kantianism || Logic and Scientific Methodology\n5. Lange as Intellectual and Activist\n\nLange\u2019s work was seen as a potent response to the intellectual\nand practical crises provoked by the materialist positions dominant in\nGermany in the mid-19th century. Along with the neo-Kantians including\nCohen and Windelband, Lange saw the positions of Czolbe, Vogt,\nB\u00fcchner, and other materialists as (justifiably) undermining\nlong-held religious and metaphysical positions. Drawing on his views\non practical pedagogy and workers\u2019 rights, Lange developed a\nform of \u201csocialist Darwinism\u201d (Weikart 1999) and defended\na Kantian \u201cethical standpoint of the ideal\u201d to replace\nwhat he saw as religious and metaphysical dogmatism.\n\nThroughout his career, Lange was remarkable for his practical\nengagement in political and workers\u2019 movements. As discussed in\nsection 1 above, his commitment to the workers\u2019 movement led him\nto participate in the second Congress of the German Workers\u2019\nAssociation. He formulated his political views in Die\nArbeiterfrage of 1865, which in turn led him to engagement with\nKarl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Ferdinand Lassalle, August Bebel, Eduard\nBernstein, and other significant political figures.\n\nLange\u2019s influence on nineteenth and twentieth century thought\nincluded, but was not limited to, his influence on the nascent Marburg\nschool of neo-Kantianism (in this respect, see Sieg 1994, K\u00f6hnke\n1991, Holzhey 1986). His engagement with Darwinism, materialism,\nsocialism, and Marxism contributed to his \u201cunusually\nstrong\u201d presence in the \u201cintellectual climate of the final\nquarter of the nineteenth century\u201d in Germany (Jacobsen 1999,\n7). Max Weber, the philosopher and pedagogist Friedrich Paulsen, and\nothers were influenced by Lange\u2019s work (Jacobsen 1999, see also\nBraun 1881, Freimuth 1995). In fact, \u201cFriedrich Paulsen, Paul\nNatorp, and Hans Vaihinger, all describe their reading of Lange as a\nconversion experience leading them into philosophy\u201d (Hill 2003,\nK\u00f6hnke 1991, 211\u2013213).\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange is a figure whose influence and thought remains\nto be judged accurately, especially in the Anglophone tradition. His\ninfluence as a teacher and as a mentor was as strong as were his more\npublic intellectual contributions. The positions Lange carved out were\nnot merely a response to nineteenth century intellectual movements\nincluding neo-Kantianism, materialism, Marxism, and Darwinism, though\nthey were regarded widely as effective responses. Lange conceived\nindependent and influential positions in logic, in national economy,\nin pedagogy, and in epistemology. He did so while pursuing a career as\nan activist and social organizer. His place in the history of\nphilosophy, of politics, and of science remains to be established by\nfuture scholarship.\n",
