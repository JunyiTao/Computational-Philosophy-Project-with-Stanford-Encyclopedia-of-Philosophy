Themes for Further Research\n\nSince dialetheism is simply a claim about truth, it can play a role in\nany area\u2014say in traditional or mainstream philosophy\u2014where \ntruth is involved. Among such topics, a prominent one is the\ndebate between\n realists\n and\n anti-realists\n (for example, idealists and constructivists) in metaphysics. Very\nroughly, to be a realist about entities of some kind is to\nmaintain that such entities objectively exist apart from, and\nantecedently to, anyone\u2019s thought of them; and, therefore, that\nour thoughts, beliefs and theories concerning such entities are made\nobjectively true or objectively false by them, apart from what we\nthink of them (more refined definitions of realism and anti-realism\nare certainly available; but this characterization will suffice for\nour purposes).\n\nIt has been claimed (Priest 2000b, Priest 2006, Ch. 2) that\ndialetheism is not by itself committed to a specific conception of\ntruth (deflationist, semantic, correspondentist, coherentist,\nconstructivist, etc.).\n\nIf something is true, there must be something that makes it so. Call\nthis the world. If some contradictions are true, then the world must\nbe such as to make this the case. In this sense, the world is\ncontradictory. What it is in the world that makes something true is\nanother matter (Priest, 2006, p.299).\n\n\nNevertheless, if we accept even a mild form of realism,\nthe truth of some contradictions entails the existence of inconsistent\nobjects and/or states of affairs: those that make the contradictions\ntrue (Berto 2007b). One may claim that it makes no sense to talk of\ninconsistent objects, situations, or states of affairs. The world is\nall there, all together: how could some pieces of it\ncontradict some other pieces? Consistency and inconsistency\nmight be taken as properties of sentences, or theories (sets of\nsentences closed under logical consequence), or propositions (what\nsentences express), or maybe thoughts, or (sets of) beliefs, etc.\nContradiction (Widerspruch, the Latin contradictio)\nhas to do with discourse (diction, sprechen,\ndicere). The world, with its non-mental and non-linguistic\ninhabitants\u2014armchairs, trees, people\u2014is not the right\nkind of thing that can be consistent or inconsistent, and\nascribing such properties to (a part of) the world is, to use Gilbert\nRyle\u2019s terminology, a category mistake.\n\n\nThese considerations might drive dialetheism towards an anti-realist\ninterpretation of the claim that there are dialetheias, true\ncontradictions; and anti-realist dialetheic theories of truth have, in\nfact, been proposed (see e.g. Beall\u2019s \u2018constructive\nmethodological deflationism\u2019, in Beall 2004). But other options\nare available to a dialetheist who wants to embrace some form of\nmetaphysically robust realism about truth. For instance, she can\nstress that consistency and inconsistency can be ascribed to (pieces\nof) the world in a derived sense: to say that the world is\n(locally) inconsistent just is to say that some true purely\ndescriptive sentences about the world have true negations.\nConsequently, and not accidentally, it is quite common in the current\nliterature both for and against dialetheism to straightforwardly speak\nof inconsistent objects, states of affairs, and entire inconsistent\nworlds. A dialetheic correspondence theory of truth might be\ncommitted, in particular, to negative facts (requiring the\nsimultaneous existence of truth-makers both for \\(A\\) and for its\nnegation, when \\(A\\) is a dialetheia); but these may be not too\ndifficult to handle (see e.g. Priest 2006, pp. 51\u20133).\n\nThere are further intermediate positions. One is \u2018semantic\ndialetheism\u2019 which accepts true contradictions without\ninconsistent objects or states of affairs as their truth-makers. This\nposition has been explored in the literature (Kroon 2004, Mares 2004).\nBeall\u2019s view, expressed in his transparent truth theory in Beall\n2009, may also be seen as a form of semantic dialetheism. Transparency\ncan be naturally paired with a\n deflationary view of truth.\n For suppose the truth predicate is a merely semantic device, coined,\nas Quine famously stressed, for expressive,\n\u2018disquotational\u2019 purposes. Then dialetheias such as the\nLiar(s) may well be semantic side-effects (\u2018spandrels\u2019, in\nBeall\u2019s terminology) of the introduction of such device, not\ninvolving any metaphysically committing contradiction in a language-\nand mind- independent world. Woodbridge and Armour-Garb (2013) argue\nthat a deflationary view of truth is best understood in terms of\nsemantic pretense (a hermeneutic fictionalist perspective), and on\nthat basis offered a pretense account of the semantic paradoxes.\nWansing (2022) advances a view called dimathematism, where\nthere may be contradictions in information (information being\n\u201cwhat is left from knowledge when you subtract, justification,\ntruth, and belief\u201d as Dunn puts it) again distinct from\ncontradictions in truth. \n\nDebates on realism and anti-realism quickly spill over into questions\nconcerning the nature of reality in general. Thus the dialetheic\nprogramme looks to metaphysical issues: if reality is dialetheic, how\nshould the ontology of a dialetheic world be spelt out? If metaphysics\nshould be placed (once again) at the very core of philosophy, the\ndebate on the possibility of dialetheias occupies a central place in\nthe core. This was, after all, Aristotle\u2019s view, too: he decided\nto speak on behalf of the unconditional validity of the LNC, not in\nhis Organon (his writings on the subject of logic), but in\nthe Metaphysics, for this was for him an issue to be\naddressed ontologically, not (only) via formal logical tools. For work\nin dialetheic metaphysics see Priest 2014, which grounds the very\nunity of objects in an inconsistent theory of parthood and boundary,\nand applies it to classic problems such as the One and the Many, and\nthe instantiation of universals.\n",
