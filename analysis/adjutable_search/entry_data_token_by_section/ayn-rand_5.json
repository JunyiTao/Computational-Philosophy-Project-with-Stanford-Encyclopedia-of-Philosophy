To accept this standard and goal is to\naccept (i) the three cardinal values of reason, purpose (or\npurposiveness) and self-esteem as not only \u201cthe means to\u201d\nbut also \u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value,\none\u2019s own life\u201d (1961b: 27), and (ii) the three\n\u201ccorresponding virtues\u201d of rationality, productiveness,\nand pride. These values are means to one\u2019s life insofar as they\nfurther one\u2019s life as a rational being, and they realize it\ninsofar as they express the value we place on our lives.\n\nWhat it means to value survival qua human being turns on the\nrelationship of the three cardinal values to the three virtues. Rand\noften states that virtue is only a means to value. But when she\nexplains how the three cardinal values \u201ccorrespond\u201d to\ntheir three virtues, she does not provide a means-end analysis\n(Badhwar 1999, 2001). Thus, she says:\n\n\nProductive work is the central purpose of a rational\nman\u2019s life, the central value that integrates and determines the\nhierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the\nprecondition of his productive work\u2014pride is the result. (1961b:\n27)\n\n\nThe virtue of productiveness becomes the central example of purpose\n(one of the three cardinal values), reason (another cardinal value)\nbecomes its source, and the virtue of pride becomes its result. Rand\nalso defines rationality, which is \u201cthe basic virtue\u201d, in\nterms of \n\n\nthe recognition and acceptance of reason as one\u2019s only source of\nknowledge \u2026 and one\u2019s only guide to action. (1961b: 28)\n\n\n\nBy this definition, being rational means valuing reason in thought,\nword, and deed, and realizing reason in one\u2019s life means being\nrational: the virtue and the value entail each other.\n\nThis point generalizes to all the virtues and values. Further, since\nthe (cardinal) values are both \u201cthe means to\u201d and\n\u201cthe realization of one\u2019s ultimate value\u201d (1961b:\n27), it follows that the (cardinal) virtues are also both the means to\nand the realization of one\u2019s ultimate value: long-term survival\nqua human being. On this interpretation, to survive\nqua human being is none other than to lead a virtuous life in\nwhich one has realized one\u2019s potential.\n\nBoth survivalists and eudaimonists, however, point out that\nthis conception of the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s oft-repeated\nclaim that \u201cVirtue is not an end in itself.\u2026\u201d In\naddition, eudaimonists make the following objections:\n\nSince even a long, virtuous life need not be a happy one, positing\nit as the final end contradicts Rand\u2019s related claim that\n\u201cLife is the reward of virtue\u2014and happiness is\nthe goal and reward of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 939).\nIt contradicts Rand\u2019s conception of the final end in her\nnovels, where happiness is proclaimed as \u201cthe purpose, the\nsanction and the meaning of life\u201d (1957 [1992]: 674).\n\n\nIn addition, it is psychologically implausible to hold that we would\nchoose mere survival as an end even if we were deeply unhappy and saw\nno happiness in our future (cf. Wright 2019 20).\n\nEudaimonists hold that the dominant and/or more plausible\nview expressed in Rand\u2019s writings is that happiness\u2014a\nhappy life\u2014is the ultimate value, where a happy life is\nunderstood as a life of emotional fulfillment in worthwhile goals and\nactivities. Happiness in this sense necessarily involves\nvirtue, but is not identical with virtue (Den Uyl &\nRasmussen 1978; Machan 1984, 2000; Mack 1984; Badhwar 1999, 2001; Hunt\n1999; Long\n 2000).[4]\n",
