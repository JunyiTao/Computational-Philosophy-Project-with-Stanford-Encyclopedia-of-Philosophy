In the introduction to the first volume she declared that\nthe immediate impulse to write it came from attending the Eichmann\ntrial in Jerusalem, while the second, equally important motive, was to\nprovide an account of our mental activities that was missing from her\nprevious work on the vita activa. It was Eichmann\u2019s absence\nof thinking, his \u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d that struck her most,\nbecause it was responsible in her view for his inability to judge in\nthose circumstances where judgment was most needed. \u201cIt was this\nabsence of thinking,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat awakened my\ninterest. Is evil-doing \u2026 possible in default of not just\n\u2018base motives\u2019 ... but of any motives whatever \u2026\nMight the problem of good and evil, our faculty for telling right from\nwrong, be connected with our faculty of thought?\u201d (LM, vol. I,\n4\u20135).\n\n\nArendt attempted a reply by connecting the activity of thinking to\nthat of judging in a twofold manner. First, thinking \u2014 the\nsilent dialogue of me and myself \u2014 dissolves our fixed habits of\nthought and the accepted rules of conduct, and thus prepares the way\nfor the activity of judging particulars without the aid of\npre-established universals. It is not that thinking provides judgment\nwith new rules for subsuming the particular under the\nuniversal. Rather, it loosens the grip of the universal over the\nparticular, thereby releasing judgment from ossified categories of\nthought and conventional standards of assessment. It is in times of\nhistorical crisis that thinking ceases to be a marginal affair,\nbecause by undermining all established criteria and values, it\nprepares the individual to judge for him or herself instead of being\ncarried away by the actions and opinions of the majority.\n\n\nThe second way in which Arendt connected the activity of thinking with\nthat of judging is by showing that thinking, by actualizing the\ndialogue of me and myself which is given in consciousness, produces\nconscience as a by-product. This conscience, unlike the voice\nof God or what later thinkers called lumen naturale, gives no\npositive prescriptions; it only tells us what not to do, what\nto avoid in our actions and dealings with others, as well as what to\nrepent of. Arendt notes in this context that Socrates\u2019 dictum\n\u201cIt is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong,\u201d and his\nproposition that \u201cIt would be better for me that my lyre or a\nchorus I directed should be out of tune and loud with discord, and\nthat multitudes of men should disagree with me, rather than that I,\nbeing one, should be out of harmony with myself and\ncontradict me,\u201d derive their validity from the idea that there\nis a silent partner within ourselves to whom we render account of our\nactions (TMC, 29\u201330; 35). What we fear most is the anticipation of the\npresence of this partner (i.e., our conscience) who awaits us at the\nend of the day.\n\n\nArendt also remarks that thinking, as the actualization of the\ndifference given in consciousness, \u201cis not a prerogative of the\nfew but an ever-present faculty in everybody; by the same token,\ninability to think is not a failing of the many who lack brain power,\nbut an ever-present possibility for everybody\u201d (LM, vol. I,\n191). For those who do engage in thinking, however, conscience emerges\nas an inevitable by-product. As the side-effect of thinking,\nconscience has its counterpart in judgment as the by-product of the\nliberating activity of thought. If conscience represents the inner\ncheck by which we evaluate our actions, judgment represents the outer\nmanifestation of our capacity to think critically. Both faculties\nrelate to the question of right and wrong, but while conscience\ndirects attention to the self, judgment directs attention to the\nworld. In this respect, judgment makes possible what Arendt calls\n\u201cthe manifestation of the wind of thought\u201d in the sphere\nof appearance.\n",
