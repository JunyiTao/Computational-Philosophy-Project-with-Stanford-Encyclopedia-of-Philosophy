    "main_text": "The Pragmatic View || Taking Stock: Pragmatic View\n4.4 Taking Stock: Pragmatic View\n\nThe analytical framework of the Pragmatic View remains under\nconstruction. The emphasis is on internal diversity, and on the\nexternal pluralism of models and theories, of modeling and theorizing,\nand of philosophical analyses of scientific theories. The Pragmatic\nView acknowledges that scientists use and need different kinds of\ntheories for a variety of purposes. There is no one-size-fits-all\nstructure of scientific theories. Notably, although the Pragmatic View\ndoes not necessarily endorse the views of the tradition of American\nPragmatism, it has important resonances with the latter school\u2019s\nemphasis on truth and knowledge as processual, purposive, pluralist,\nand context-dependent, and on the social and cognitive structure of\nscientific inquiry.\n\nA further qualification in addition to the one above regarding\nAmerican Pragmatism is in order. The Pragmatic View has important\nprecursors in the historicist or \u201cworld view\u201d perspectives\nof Feyerabend, Hanson, Kuhn, and Toulmin, which were an influential\nset of critiques of the Syntactic View utterly distinct from the\nSemantic View. This philosophical tradition focused on themes such as\nmeaning change and incommensurability of terms across world views\n(e.g., paradigms), scientific change (e.g., revolutionary: Kuhn 1970;\nevolutionary: Toulmin 1972), the interweaving of context of discovery\nand context of justification, and scientific rationality (Preston\n2012; Bird 2013; Swoyer 2014). The historicists also opposed the idea\nthat theories can secure meaning and empirical support from a\ntheory-neutral and purely observational source, as the Syntactic View\nhad insisted on with its strong distinction between theoretical and\nobservational vocabularies (cf. Galison 1988). Kuhn\u2019s paradigms\nor, more precisely, \u201cdisciplinary matrices\u201d even had an\ninternal anatomy with four components: (i) laws or symbolic\ngeneralizations, (ii) ontological assumptions, (iii) values, and (iv)\nexemplars (Kuhn 1970, postscript; Godfrey-Smith 2003; Hacking 2012).\nThis work was concerned more with theory change than with theory\nstructure and had fewer conceptual resources from sociology of science\nand history of science than contemporary Pragmatic View work.\nMoreover, paradigms never quite caught on the way analyses of models\nand modeling have. Even so, this work did much to convince later\nscholars, including many of the Pragmatic View, of certain weaknesses\nin understanding theories as deductive axiomatic structures.\n",
