    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || Public and Private\n1.4 Public and Private\n\nAnother central theme in feminist philosophy of law is the viability\nof the public/private distinction. For liberals, including liberal\nfeminists, there remains a domain of private life that should be\nreserved for individual choice.  Radical feminists raise the\nconcerns that patriarchy and sexual dominance pervade private\nrelationships and there are no clear lines to be drawn between actions\nthat primarily affect the individual and actions that affect others\nmore broadly. Legal structures that permit or reinforce dominance\nwithin intimate relationships are thus deeply problematic and must be\noverturned. One area where this debate has taken shape among feminists\nis the law of prostitution (see the discussion in the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex markets);\n some liberals claim that when prostitution is fully voluntary, it\nshould be legally permitted, and the role of law is to prohibit\ncoercive forms of the practice. Other feminists argue that legalized\nprostitution simply allows sex trafficking to flourish in its shadow\n(Dempsey 2010) or more comprehensively that paid sex can never be\nfully voluntary (Miriam 2005). Other continuing areas of theoretical\nexploration among feminists are the weight and scope to be given to\nany distinction between the public and the private in reproduction,\nfamily structures, work arrangements, sexual relationships, domestic\nviolence, and the like; these issues are discussed further in later\nsections of this essay. \n",
