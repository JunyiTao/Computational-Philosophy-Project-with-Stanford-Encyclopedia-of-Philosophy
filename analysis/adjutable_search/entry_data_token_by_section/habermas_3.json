He also produced some seminal transitional\nworks which dealt with the issues raised in the early work.\nLegitimation Crisis (1975), or to give the full original\ntitle, Legitimationsprobleme im Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus (1973),\nis a sketch of an incipient research programme that sets out from a\ncritique of Marx\u2019s social theory, which sees crises in\ncapitalist societies as arising not from the immiseration of the\nworking classes and class struggle, which have largely been pacified\nby the welfare state and economic growth, but from legitimation\ndeficits due to alterations in the constellation of economics and\npolitics. The problem posed by legitimation crises, which are specific\nto late capitalism, is how the increasing intervention of the state in\neconomic affairs can be made legitimate to those who are affected by\nthese state interventions, and hold the state responsible for their\neffects. In conclusion, Habermas develops some hypotheses about how\nsuch crises can be resolved. The best-case scenario is that\nlegitimation takes place through discursive justification, on the\nbasis of norms embodying generalizable interests, and, failing that,\nthrough various kinds of compromise (1973a [1975: 112\u2013114]). On\nthis model normative structures and ideals of consensus become the key\nvantage point through which societies can be understood and criticized\nby the social theorist.\n\nThis thesis is further elaborated in the collection of essays entitled\nZur Rekonstruction des historischen Materialismus (1976a). In\nthis volume Habermas challenges the Marxian assumption that\ndevelopments in the sphere of social integration are determined by\ndevelopments in the sphere of material production. By contrast he\nposits a logic of the development of normative structures, which\nrepresent the institutional analogues of the stages of cognitive\ndevelopment of moral consciousness in individuals as developed and\ntested by the cognitive moral psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1976a:\n9\u201349 [1979: 95\u2013130]). These normative structures represent\na directional sequence of discrete stages that gain in complexity and\ncomprehensiveness as they develop, and make collective learning\npossible. They allow different kinds of reasons to count as\nlegitimations for the relevant kinds of social structures and levels\nof social integration, and serve as normative standpoints in the light\nof which societies can be understood and criticized. Crucially, they\nexhibit a logic of development altogether independent from that of the\nforces of production.\n\nAt the time, Marxists criticized Habermas\u2019s work both for\nabandoning central tenets of Marxism and for conceding too much to\nNiklas Luhmann\u2019s system\u2019s theory (Ebbighausen 1976). That\nsaid, Habermas denies Luhmann\u2019s central claim that legitimacy is\nnothing but the motiveless acquiescence of citizens to the binding\ndecisions of an administrative mechanism (Luhmann 1969). As for\nHabermas\u2019s Marxism, the very focus of his transitional work on\nthe system crises of capitalist society betrays not only the\ntheoretical aspiration to understand capitalism, but also the\npractical aspiration to overcome it, or at least to understand how it\ncould be overcome. That said, since the theory of legitimation crisis,\nas McCarthy noted, is not addressed to any agent of social\ntransformation, it must ultimately remain content with diagnosing\ncrisis tendencies (McCarthy 1978).\n",
