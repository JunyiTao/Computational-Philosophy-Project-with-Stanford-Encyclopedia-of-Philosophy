    "main_text": "Population Genetics\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe structure of scientific theories is a rich topic. Theorizing and\nmodeling are core activities across the sciences, whether old (e.g.,\nrelativity theory, evolutionary theory) or new (e.g., climate\nmodeling, cognitive science, and systems biology). Furthermore, theory\nremains essential to developing multipurpose tools such as statistical\nmodels and procedures (e.g., Bayesian models for data analysis,\nagent-based models for simulation, network theory for systems\nanalysis). Given the strength and relevance of theory and theorizing\nto the natural sciences, and even to the social sciences (e.g.,\nmicroeconomics, physical, if not cultural, anthropology),\nphilosophical attention to the structure of scientific theories could\nand should increase. This piece has focused on a comparison of three\nmajor perspectives: Syntactic View, Semantic View, and Pragmatic View.\nIn order to handle these complex debates effectively, we have\nsidestepped certain key philosophical questions, including questions\nabout scientific realism; scientific explanation and prediction;\ntheoretical and ontological reductionism; knowledge-production and\nepistemic inference; the distinction between science and technology;\nand the relationship between science and society. Each of these topics\nbears further philosophical investigation in light of the three\nperspectives here explored.\n\nA table helps summarize general aspects of the three views\u2019\nanalyses of the structure of scientific theories:\n\n\n\n\nSyntactic View\nSemantic View\nPragmatic View \n\nTheory Structure\nUninterpreted axiomatic system\n(i) State-space,\n\n(ii) Model-/set-theoretic\nInternal and external pluralism \n\nTheory Interpretation\nCorrespondence rules\n(i) Hierarchy of models,\n\n(ii) Similarity,\n\n(iii) Isomorphism\n(i) Structure already inflected by practice, function, and\napplication\n\n(ii) Pragmatic virtues \n\nIs theory interpretation an aspect of theory structure?\nYes\nNo\nYes, although the distinction is hard to make. \n\n\nTable 2. General aspects of each\nview\u2019s analysis of the structure of scientific theories.\n\n\nThe Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic views are often taken to be\nmutually exclusive and, thus, to be in competition with one another.\nThey indeed make distinct claims about the anatomy of scientific\ntheories. But one can also imagine them to be complementary, focusing\non different aspects and questions of the structure of scientific\ntheories and the process of scientific theorizing. For instance, in\nexploring nonformal and implicit components of theory, the Pragmatic\nView accepts that scientific theories often include mathematical\nparts, but tends to be less interested in these components. Moreover,\nthere is overlap in questions\u2014e.g., Syntactic and Semantic Views\nshare an interest in formalizing theory; the Semantic and Pragmatic\nViews both exhibit concern for scientific practice.\n\nHow are these three views ultimately related? A standard philosophical\nmove is to generalize and abstract, understanding a situation from a\nhigher level. One \u201cmeta\u201d hypothesis is that a given\nphilosophical analysis of theory structure tends to be associated with\na perceived relationship among the three views here discussed. The\nSyntactic View is inclined to interpret the Semantic View\u2019s\nformal machinery as continuous with its own generalizing axiomatic\nstrategy, and hence diagnoses many standard Semantic View critiques\n(Section 3) as missing their mark (the strategy of identity;\ne.g., Friedman 1982; Worrall 1984; Halvorson 2012, 2013, 2019; Lutz\n2012, 2017; cf. Chakravartty 2001). The Semantic View explicitly\ncontrasts its characterization of theory structure with the\n\u201clinguistic\u201d or \u201cmetamathematical\u201d apparatus\nof the Syntactic View (the strategy of combat; e.g., Suppe\n1977; van Fraassen 1980, 1989; Lloyd 1994 [1988]). Finally, the\nPragmatic View, which did not exist as a perspective until relatively\nrecently, imagines theory as pluralistic and can thus ground a\nholistic philosophical investigation. It envisions a meta-pluralism in\nwhich reconstructive axiomatization and mathematical modeling remain\nimportant, though not necessary for all theories. This third view\nendorses a panoply of theoretical structures and theorizing styles,\nnegotiating continuity both between theorizing and \u201cthe\nexperimental life,\u201d and among philosophical analyses of the\nstructure of scientific theories (the strategy of\ncomplementarity; e.g., Hacking 1983, 2009; Galison 1988,\n1997; Craver 2002; Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright 2008; Griesemer 2013). Interestingly, Su\u00e1rez and Pero\n(2019) explicitly concur with the Pragmatic View as described in this\narticle, but believe that \u201cthe semantic conception in its bare\nminimal expression\u201d is compatible with, if not sufficient for,\ncapturing \u201cpragmatic elements and themes involved in a more\nflexible and open-ended approach to scientific theory\u201d\n(Su\u00e1rez and Pero 2019, 348). By design, the ecumenical\nmeta-pluralism sanctioned by the Pragmatic View does not completely\noffset identity and combat strategies. Moreover, only \u201cpartial\nacceptance\u201d of the respective views may ultimately be possible.\nEven so, the complementarity strategy might be worth developing\nfurther. Compared to identity and combat meta-perspectives, it\nprovides broader\u2014or at least different\u2014insights into the\nstructure of scientific theories. More generally, exploring the\nrelations among these views is itself a rich topic for future\nphilosophical work, as is investigating their role in, and\ninterpretation of, active scientific fields ripe for further\nphilosophical analysis such as climate change (e.g., Winsberg 2018),\nmodel organisms (e.g., Ankeny and Leonelli 2020), and cartography and\nGIS (e.g., Winther 2020).\n",
