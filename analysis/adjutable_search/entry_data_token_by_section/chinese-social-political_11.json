    "main_text": "The Early Imperial Era\n3. The Early Imperial Era\n\nIn 221 BCE the king of the state of Qin vanquishes his final rival and\ndeclares himself the First Emperor, inaugurating both the Qin dynasty\nand China\u2019s imperial era. The First Emperor\u2019s success was\nfounded in part on his adherence to social and political ideas akin to\nthose in the Book of Lord Shang, and he endeavors to extend\nsocio-political standardization and control in unprecedented ways in\nthe new empire. The Qin dynasty does not long outlive its founder, but\nit is followed by the four-century-long Han dynasty in which many of\nkey characteristics of imperial Chinese state and society are first\nestablished. A lengthy period of disunity follows the collapse of the\nHan in 220 CE; over this period and through the succeeding Sui and\nTang dynasties, intellectuals focus less on social and political\nphilosophy than on issues of spiritual cultivation and abstract\nmetaphysics: in particular, this is the era when Chinese Buddhism\ncomes of age. While there certainly is socio-political thinking to be\nfound (see, for example, Chiu-Duke 2000) it makes sense to focus in\nthis section on the Han dynasty.\n\nIn the area of social and political philosophy, Han dynasty thinkers\nmake three main contributions. First of all, they seek to better\nunderstand and systematize their inheritance from the classical era.\nIn part they do this by editing and establishing standard editions of\nearlier texts; many of these now-classic texts take their current form\nat the hands of Han dynasty scholars. Another important aspect of this\nwork is establishing categories through which to understand the\nclassical era authors and debates. Distinctions among \u201cschools\n(jia)\u201d such as Confucian, Mohist, Standards\n(fajia, often translated as \u201cLegalist\u201d), and\nDaoist (daodejia) come from the efforts of Han scholars to\ndivide up earlier thinkers\u2019 approach to governance in particular\n(Csikszentmihalyi 2006: xvii; Smith 2003). The second important\ncontribution during the Han dynasty lies at the intersection of\nthought and practice: rulers and the advisers implement a variety of\ninstitutions aimed at realizing socio-political goals that rest on a\nsynthesis of classical thinking. That is, notwithstanding the efforts\nto distinguish various classical schools of thought, much Han thought\nand practice was highly synthetic, seeking to harmonize the insights\nof all schools. This meant building a state that rests on laws and\nother \u201cstandards\u201d as well as on rituals and on the ethical\ncharacters of the rulers. Han emperors establish central educational\ninstitutions and initiate the practice of bringing talented scholars\ninto the government via examination (albeit at a much smaller scale\nthan in the later Neo-Confucian era).\n\nThe third contribution of Han thinkers is their individual\nphilosophizing about the ways that state and society should be\norganized and fit into the larger cosmos; we will briefly consider\nthree examples. Jia Yi (200\u2013168 BCE) was a statesman and thinker\nwhose eclectic philosophizing was emblematic of his era. He is best\nknown, though, for his \u201cConfucian\u201d-sounding ethical and\npolitical writings. For example, he carefully articulates the ways\nthat a crown prince should be educated, living alongside scrupulously\ncorrect people so as to acquire a correct \u201csecond nature\u201d,\njust as one acquires one\u2019s mother tongue. As the prince matures,\nhe must be open to the realities of the world and to his own\nfallibility: Jia prescribes that \u201cWooden boards are erected, on\nwhich people might censure his actions. He is subject to the drum of\nremonstrance\u201d (HCT pp. 12\u201313). Jia elaborates on the\nimplied vision of socio-political order in another essay, arguing that\nwhile the common people must be punished when they violate standards\nsuch as laws, high officials are accountable to ritual and ethics\nrather than public law. These latter methods enable the cultivation of\na sense of shame, an internal moral compass, which in turn will enable\nofficials to learn from public remonstration\u2014which is explicitly\nlegitimate\u2014and to adjudicate wisely in law courts (HCT, pp.\n36\u20137).\n\nAnother feature of Han socio-political thought is an emphasis on\n\u201cnon-action (wuwei)\u201d. The term is best-known from\nthe Dao De Jing, although the term and, more broadly, the\ngeneral ideal of non-purposive, spontaneous action is widespread in\nWarring States thought (Slingerland 2003). In the Han we see it\nadapted to many different approaches to governance. The Utopian vision\nthat lies at the heart of the Dao De Jing (on at least one\ncommon reading) is still present, but more common is a synthesis of\nritual or legal standards with the idea of non-action. For example,\none official recommends what he takes to have been the approach of the\nearly sage kings, which was that \u201cIn making laws and edicts,\nthey made sure [those laws and edicts] accorded with human\ndispositions and only then put them into effect\u201d (HCT, p. 60).\nIn this way, people follow the laws naturally, needing no overt\nintervention on the part of the state. Texts that brought together an\nemphasis on overt standards and ideas like non-action are widespread;\nin fact, the earliest extant commentaries on the Dao De Jing\nare included as chapters\u2014likely added to the text in the\nHan\u2014of the Han Feizi, which as we saw above is the\nepitome of standards-based governance.\n\nFinally, many thinkers in the Han stress the ways in which human\nactivity fits into and is even shaped by cosmological processes and\npatterns. Here is an example of such a naturalistic justification of\nthe political order:\n\n\nThe five phases each move according to its place in the\nsequence\u2026. This is the reason that wood rules life, metal rules\ndeath, fire rules heat, and water rules cold. Human beings have no\nchoice but to go by their sequence, and officials have no choice but\nto go by their abilities. (HCT, p. 178)\n\n\nIn such a context astronomical and other portents take on significant\npolitical roles, though the Han also had famous skeptics like Wang\nChong (27 CE\u2013100 CE) who denied their importance. All in all, we\ncan say that the Han bequeathed to China a normative vision\nemphasizing socio-political harmony, even including harmony with the\ncosmos, that has room for various objective standards alongside\nimportant roles played by virtuous rulers and ministers.\n",
