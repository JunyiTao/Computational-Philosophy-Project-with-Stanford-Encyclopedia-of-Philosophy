    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || Evolution of Inheritance Systems\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe study of inheritance systems attempts to synthesize recent\ndiscoveries about inheritance mechanisms and processes in nature with\nreflection about the nature and dynamics of evolutionary processes.\nThe term \u201cinheritance system\u201d is typically used to refer\nto both mechanisms and factors involved in inheritance, but the term\nlacks a standard definition which goes beyond enumerating various\npurported inheritance systems, and it is unclear if a single\ndefinition can capture the different uses of the term. A principled\ndefinition that determines how inheritance systems are individuated\nand delimited\u2014if indeed they can be\u2014 may be essential for\naddressing many conceptual issues that remain open (see Griesemer et\nal. 2005). The lack of a universally accepted definition may explain\nthe fruitfulness of the term but also suggests approaching the\nliterature with caution.\n\nThe discussion above tried as much as possible to present a unified\nframework for the discussion of inheritance systems that is not tied\nto any particular account. It contrasted the multiple inheritance\nsystems view with monist (i.e., geno-centrism) and holistic views\n(i.e., DST) about inheritance\n (section 1.3)\n and stressed the developmental, mechanism-oriented, perspective on\nreproduction that underlies many discussions of inheritance systems\n(see\n section 2).\n\nThe multiple inheritance system perspective highlights a variety of\nquestions (see\n section 4)\n and many fundamental questions remain open. Some of them depend on\nempirical work, perhaps most importantly determining the prevalence\nand stability of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance\n(Helanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010; Jablonka & Raz 2009; Shea et al.\n2011). The developmental aspects of many of the inheritance systems\ndiscussed in this entry, in particular behavioral inheritance, are\nstill not fully understood. Generally, many open questions remain\nabout the interactions between the various systems and about their\nevolution, in particular the evolution of social learning and the\nevolution of language. A crucial element downplayed by most\ncontemporary accounts is the connection between population level\nissues, such as population size, mating strategies, etc., and the\nproperties of inheritance systems. Addressing these issues requires\nquantitative modeling, and eventually the integration of multiple\ninheritance systems with their different characteristics into\npopulation genetics (see Day & Bonduriansky 2011, Geoghegan &\nSpencer 2012).\n\nSeveral topics that are receiving significant attention in the biology\nresearch community are directly related to the discussion of\ninheritance systems. One is the invigorated field of cultural\nevolution and social learning (see Whiten 2017). A second area is the\ndiscussion of inheritance of regulatory RNA molecules, an epigenetic\ninheritance process that goes beyond the transmission of RNA and\ninvolves developmental re-production (see Veigl 2017). A third area,\nalready receiving significant attention from philosophers, is the\nhereditary properties and function of the microbiome. This is tied to\nthe recent interest in holobionts, a term that refers to assemblages\nof multiple species, notably multi-cellular organisms and bacteria,\nthat form ecological and potentially evolutionary units. It has been\nargued by some researchers that holobionts are units of selection and\nthat the combined genome of the host and symbionts, dubbed \u2018the\nhologenome\u2019, is conceptually analogous to the genome, with the\nbacteria being analogous to genes. Arguably, this inheritance system\nhas Lamarckian dimensions. Other researchers argue that the degree of\nvertical transmission of symbionts is typically too low to qualify the\nholobionts as units of selection. For discussion of these issues see\nHurst (2017), Opstal & Bordenstein (2015), and section IV of\nGissis, Lamm & Shavit (2018). Finally, increasing knowledge of the\ngenetic system itself, in particular the role of chromatin shape and\ndynamics in gene expression as well as in mutation, recombination, and\nother fundamental processes, may lead to new perspectives on the\nrelation between the genetic system and epigenetic mechanisms, and\nimprove our understanding of the transmission of chromatin state.\nArguably, the DNA and non-DNA components of the genome should be seen\nand studied as a dynamic and responsive developmental system (Lamm\n2011, 2014). Moreover, better understanding of how genetic adaptation\nis reached under experimental conditions suggests how physiological\nand epigenetic responses may facilitate adaptation via other means,\nmaking a fitness improving response increasingly more robust, up to\npotentially becoming established via appropriate mutations (Yona et\nal. 2015). These results may lead to rethinking the dichotomy between\nplasticity and evolvability (Lamm & Jablonka 2008) and support the\nidea of \u201cnatural genetic engineering\u201d systems (see Shapiro\n2011). \n\nNon-genetic inheritance can have short term evolutionary effects and\ncan affect genetic evolution (e.g., through genetic assimilation).\nHowever, the long-term and macro-evolutionary significance of\nnon-genetic inheritance, and in particular its effects on the way\npopulations respond to selection is still being debated (e.g.,\nHelanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010: 4). Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s\nevolutionary views stress the role of \u201csoft inheritance,\u201d\nor the inheritance of acquired characters, which is exhibited by many\nof the non-genetic inheritance systems. Partly on account of this they\nare among those who raise the need to revise and extend the Modern\nEvolutionary Synthesis (Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010). The Modern\nSynthesis marginalized soft inheritance and viewed significant\nevolutionary change to be solely the result of gradual selection\nworking on random variations. The assumptions underlying this view are\nchallenged by work on non-genetic inheritance.\n",
