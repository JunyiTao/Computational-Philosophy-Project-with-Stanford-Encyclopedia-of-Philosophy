Impact and Influence\n\n\nGassendi's views were often transmitted in the early modern era\nthrough the medium of Fran\u00e7ois Bernier's\nAbr\u00e9g\u00e9 (1678/84), which work highlights the\natomist views and materialist tendencies of Gassendism. Such themes,\nas well as empiricist threads of Gassendism, were attractive to a\nnumber of late seventeenth century physicists and physicians\n(viz. Nicholas de Bl\u00e9gny, Guy Patin, Antoine Menjot, and\nGuillaume Lamy) and other philosophers (viz. Gilles de Launay), as\nwell as those among the Montmor circle or libertins\n\u00e9rudits (viz.  Samuel Sorbi\u00e8re, Jean Chapelain, and\nCyrano de Bergerac). Still others, especially Cartesians such as\nDesgabets and Cordemoy, were rather distasteful of those themes, as\nwere hard-line theologians such as Louis Le Valois.\n\n\nAs Lennon (1993), Brockliss (1997), and others have noted,\nGassendi's overall influence in the French education system was\nnot a match for the Cartesian alternatives, and his views were\nconsidered especially unworthy after his atomist views gained currency\nin England.\n\n\nThe British success of Gassendism had three textual sources. In\naddition to the Opera Omnia and Bernier's\nAbr\u00e9g\u00e9, Walter Charleton produced a selective\nand amended English translation of parts of the Animadversiones,\nintermingled with other sources and his own perspectives (1654). There\nwas as well a group of atomist enthusiasts in the Newcastle Circle,\nand a small existing British Epicurean club, whose members included\nKenelm Digby and Nathaniel Highmore. This backdrop of sympathetic\nsources, not entirely faithful to the original, allowed a substantial\nand diffuse influence of Gassendi's views in British thought. We see\nGassendism shaping the work of lesser figures such as Francis Glisson\n(who embraced a vis motrix) and Thomas Willis (who crafted a\nmaterialist theory of neural transmission based on Gassendi's view\n(Wallace 2003)) but also such major thinkers as Boyle, Locke, Newton,\nHume, and Reid. Those sources of influence themselves were\nsufficiently diffuse that it is difficult to make precise Gassendi's\nimprint on these later authors, except where they explicitly\nacknowledge their debts.\n\n\nBoyle finds Gassendi's thinking agreeable in three respects.  First,\nhe embraces Gassendi's criticism of Descartes' ontological argument as\nrooted in an assumption as to the nature of God impervious to\nproof. Second, he follows in the Gassendist model of placing\nempiricism and experiment at the center of a viable scientific\nmethod. Third, he praises Gassendi's corpuscularian theory as a worthy\nontology for the mechanical model of explanation, hastening to add\nthat further experimentation should give sufficient demonstration of\nthe verity of atomism. Indeed, he refuses to judge between the\nGassendist and Cartesian alternatives, presumably on the grounds that\nwe cannot produce evidence to decide the issue of matter's infinite\ndivisibility.\n\n\nAs Locke is concerned, it is by now well established that he may have\nread Gassendi directly, and almost certainly read Bernier. The\nevidence of influence shows up in some central Lockean theses: the\ncorpuscularian philosophy (here he follows Boyle as surely as he does\nGassendi), primary and secondary qualities distinction (a view also\nheld by Boyle, Descartes, Galileo, and others still), and broad\ncommitment to empiricism, including the negative thesis against innate\nideas and the positive thesis identifying sensory data as the primary\nsource of ideas. We also see Gassendi's likely inspiration in Locke's\nprobabilist embrace of an understanding of natural philosophy through\nless-than-certain claims about the world, though his sub-par ranking\nof \u2018sensitive apprehension\u2019 of the world is a rejection of\nthe Gassendist picture of sensory knowledge as the best for which we\nmight hope. Locke's theory of language, too, reveals Gassendi's\ninfluence: the notion of nominal essences resonates with the proposal\nin the Institutio Logica that the meaning of general terms is a\nfunction of our sensory-based ideas, which contribute to our picture\nof the properties we typically associate with the objects of those\nterms. Finally, in regard to ethics, Locke offers a perfectly\nGassendist linkage between good and evil on the one hand and pleasure\nand pain on the other, and like Gassendi celebrates the notion of\npersonal autonomy, though he locates the seat of moral judgment in\nexternal norms (most prominently, the natural law) rather than any\ninternal ideals or virtues such as Gassendi upholds.\n\n\nNewton reveals various interests in Gassendist themes, dating to an\nearly reading in his student days (see the Trinity\nNotebooks). For one, he adopts the notion that Aristotelian\nsubstance and accident fail to define all existents, and (along with\nBarrow, who likely read Gassendi as well) suggests that absolute space\nand time represent the fundamental ontological framework into which\nmatter and its phenomena are located. For another, he espouses a form\nof the mechanical philosophy, albeit one that departs from orthodoxy\n(as pronounced by Gassendi) in that God plays a significant and\nsustained role in determining the course of natural phenomena. Here he\nfollows Gassendi's thought most closely in admitting atoms to his\nontology, nearly replicating Gassendi's list of atomic properties,\nproposing that atomic structures yield chemical bonds that account for\nthe structures of larger bodies, and endorsing the Gassendist notion\nof light as flowing in a stream of atoms (in opposition to the\nCartesian wave theory promoted by Hooke and Huygens).  In the spirit\nof Boyle, though, Newton tends to treat his matter theory as\ninstrumentally useful rather than as a universal hypothesis in search\nof further instances. In this way he hopes to avoid the hard questions\nabout our ability to summon empirical verification of their existence\nor precise character. One famous Newtonian methodological dictum\nindicates there are aspects of atoms we can know, however. In the\nPrincipia (1687), Newton suggests a transdictive principle of\nGassendist provenance (also embraced by Locke), according to which the\nbasic properties of bodies on the micro-scale (\u201cthe least\nparticles of all bodies\u201d) may be inferred from such properties\nof bodies as we have evidence of, on the macro-scale.\n\n\nHume is less interested in affirming ontologies than in showing why we\nhave no good reason to invest belief in them, and accordingly picks up\non the rather different Gassendist theme of coming to terms with the\nancient Skeptics. His moderate or constructive skepticism\n(pace Popkin) is founded on doubts concerning the possibility\nof justified belief, focusing on the problem of induction as the great\ndifficulty undercutting our ability to know about the world. Lacking\nrational justification, we simply fall back on induction as a\npracticable means of grasping and managing our experience of events.\nHere we see a striking similarity with Gassendi's\nassessment\u2014beginning with the observation that justifying any\ngeneralization on particulars requires something beyond our cognitive\npowers, namely, our empirical knowledge of all such particulars. From\nthis point, Hume draws the Gassendist lesson that induction cannot be\ndemonstrative, for lack of this generalization step or the supposition\n\u201cthat apart from those enumerated there occurs none which is\ndifferent\u201d (O I (Institutio Logica) 113a). Finally,\nHume's proposed resolution also resembles Gassendi's notion that we\nmight simply posit, as a matter of utility, the conformity of all\nremaining unenumerated particulars.\n\n\nInto the late eighteenth century, we see Gassendi's influence in\nReid's theory of external knowledge. This theory is centered on the\nnotion of what he calls \u2018suggestion\u2019, or the evincing in\nus by our sensory data of concepts corresponding to the qualities of\nthings in the world. In its broad sense, \u2018suggestion\u2019\nconsists in a signing relationship\u2014as a matter of convention,\ncustom, or biology\u2014between things or events in the world which\nmay be construed as signs (in the case of conventional signs, these\nmay be linguistic or symbolic entities) and what those things or\nevents signify. Here Reid draws on the long tradition of theories of\nsigns, likely relying in this instance on Gassendi in particular,\nrelative to the distinction between conventional\n(\u2018artificial\u2019) and customary and biological\n(\u2018natural\u2019).\n\n\nGassendi's influence spread further still, beyond Britain or the\nmodern era. The young Leibniz consciously followed Gassendi in\nembracing atomism, later retaining high regard for mechanism but\nabandoning the material model of substance in favor of the monadology\n(Moll 1982). Christiaan Huygens pursued numerous Gassendist themes,\nincluding anti-Aristotelianism, probabilism, a method of hypothesis,\nand atomist matter theory. Gassendi's libertine, atomist, empiricist,\nand quasi-heliocentrist views also met with keen interest further\nafield, among like-minded philosophers and natural scientists in early\nmodern Poland, Italy, and Spain (Murr, 1997). In more recent times,\nGassendi would come to be seen as anticipating such notable views as\nMill's proposal that mathematical knowledge is empirical, and Popper's\nnotion that empirical falsifiability is a test of a hypothesis'\nprima facie viability.\n",
