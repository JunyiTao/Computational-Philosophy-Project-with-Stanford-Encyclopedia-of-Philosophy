    "main_text": "The Mind-Body Problem and the History of Dualism || The Mind-Body Problem\n1.1 The Mind-Body Problem\n\n\nThe mind-body problem is the problem: what is the relationship between\nmind and body? Or alternatively: what is the relationship between\nmental properties and physical properties?\n\n\nHumans have (or seem to have) both physical properties and mental\nproperties. People have (or seem to have)the sort of properties\nattributed in the physical sciences. These physical properties include\nsize, weight, shape, colour, motion through space and time, etc. But\nthey also have (or seem to have) mental properties, which we do not\nattribute to typical physical objects These properties involve\nconsciousness (including perceptual experience, emotional experience,\nand much else), intentionality (including beliefs, desires, and much\nelse), and they are possessed by a subject or a self.\n\n\nPhysical properties are public, in the sense that they are, in\nprinciple, equally observable by anyone. Some physical\nproperties \u2013 like those of an electron \u2013 are not directly\nobservable at all, but they are equally available to all, to the same\ndegree, with scientific equipment and techniques. The same is not true\nof mental properties. I may be able to tell that you are in pain by\nyour behaviour, but only you can feel it directly. Similarly, you just\nknow how something looks to you, and I can only surmise. Conscious\nmental events are private to the subject, who has a privileged access\nto them of a kind no-one has to the physical.\n\n\nThe mind-body problem concerns the relationship between these two sets\nof properties. The mind-body problem breaks down into a number of\ncomponents.\n\nThe ontological question: what are mental states and what are\nphysical states? Is one class a subclass of the other, so that all\nmental states are physical, or vice versa? Or are mental states and\nphysical states entirely distinct?\nThe causal question: do physical states influence mental states?\nDo mental states influence physical states? If so, how?\n\n\n\nDifferent aspects of the mind-body problem arise for different aspects\nof the mental, such as consciousness, intentionality, the self.\n\nThe problem of consciousness: what is consciousness? How is it\nrelated to the brain and the body?\nThe problem of intentionality: what is intentionality? How is it\nrelated to the brain and the body?\nThe problem of the self: what is the self? How is it related to\nthe brain and the body?\n\n\n\nOther aspects of the mind-body problem arise for aspects of the\nphysical. For example:\n\nThe problem of embodiment: what is it for the mind to be housed in\na body? What is it for a body to belong to a particular subject?\n\n\n\nThe seemingly intractable nature of these problems have given rise to\nmany different philosophical views.\n\n\nMaterialist views say that, despite appearances to the contrary,\nmental states are just physical states. Behaviourism, functionalism,\nmind-brain identity theory and the computational theory of mind are\nexamples of how materialists attempt to explain how this can be\nso. The most common factor in such theories is the attempt to\nexplicate the nature of mind and consciousness in terms of their\nability to directly or indirectly modify behaviour, but there are\nversions of materialism that try to tie the mental to the physical\nwithout explicitly explaining the mental in terms of its\nbehaviour-modifying role. The latter are often grouped together under\nthe label \u2018non-reductive physicalism\u2019, though this label\nis itself rendered elusive because of the controversial nature of the\nterm \u2018reduction\u2019.\n\n\nIdealist views say that physical states are really mental. This is\nbecause the physical world is an empirical world and, as\nsuch, it is the intersubjective product of our collective\nexperience.\n\n\nDualist views (the subject of this entry) say that the mental and the\nphysical are both real and neither can be assimilated to the\nother. For the various forms that dualism can take and the associated\nproblems, see below.\n\n\nIn sum, we can say that there is a mind-body problem because both\nconsciousness and thought, broadly construed, seem very different from\nanything physical and there is no convincing consensus on how to build\na satisfactorily unified picture of creatures possessed of both a mind\nand a body.\n\n\nOther entries which concern aspects of the mind-body problem include\n(among many others):\n behaviorism, \n consciousness, \n eliminative materialism, \n epiphenomenalism, \n functionalism, \n identity theory,\n intentionality, \n mental causation, \n neutral monism, \nand\n physicalism.\n\n1.2 History of dualism\nIn dualism, \u2018mind\u2019 is contrasted with\n\u2018body\u2019, but at different times, different aspects of the\nmind have been the centre of attention. In the classical and mediaeval\nperiods, it was the intellect that was thought to be most obviously\nresistant to a materialistic account: from Descartes on, the main\nstumbling block to materialist monism was supposed to be\n\u2018consciousness\u2019, of which phenomenal consciousness or\nsensation came to be considered as the paradigm instance.\n\n\nThe classical emphasis originates in Plato\u2019s Phaedo. Plato\nbelieved that the true substances are not physical bodies, which are\nephemeral, but the eternal Forms of which bodies are imperfect copies.\nThese Forms not only make the world possible, they also make it\nintelligible, because they perform the role of universals, or what\nFrege called \u2018concepts\u2019. It is their connection with\nintelligibility that is relevant to the philosophy of mind. Because\nForms are the grounds of intelligibility, they are what the intellect\nmust grasp in the process of understanding. In Phaedo Plato\npresents a variety of arguments for the immortality of the soul, but\nthe one that is relevant for our purposes is that the intellect is\nimmaterial because Forms are immaterial and intellect must have an\naffinity with the Forms it apprehends (78b4\u201384b8). This affinity\nis so strong that the soul strives to leave the body in which it is\nimprisoned and to dwell in the realm of Forms. It may take many\nreincarnations before this is achieved. Plato\u2019s dualism is not,\ntherefore, simply a doctrine in the philosophy of mind, but an\nintegral part of his whole metaphysics.\n\n\nOne problem with Plato\u2019s dualism was that, though he speaks of the\nsoul as imprisoned in the body, there is no clear account of what\nbinds a particular soul to a particular body. Their difference in\nnature makes the union a mystery.\n\n\nAristotle did not believe in Platonic Forms, existing independently of\ntheir instances. Aristotelian forms (the capital \u2018F\u2019 has\ndisappeared with their standing as autonomous entities) are the\nnatures and properties of things and exist embodied in those\nthings. This enabled Aristotle to explain the union of body and soul\nby saying that the soul is the form of the body. This means that a\nparticular person\u2019s soul is no more than his nature as a human\nbeing. Because this seems to make the soul into a property of the\nbody, it led many interpreters, both ancient and modern, to interpret\nhis theory as materialistic. The interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy of mind \u2013 and, indeed, of his whole doctrine of\nform \u2013 remains as live an issue today as it was immediately after\nhis death (Robinson 1983 and 1991; Nussbaum 1984; Rorty and Nussbaum,\neds, 1992). Nevertheless, the text makes it clear that Aristotle\nbelieved that the intellect, though part of the soul, differs from\nother faculties in not having a bodily organ. His argument for this\nconstitutes a more tightly argued case than Plato\u2019s for the\nimmateriality of thought and, hence, for a kind of dualism. He argued\nthat the intellect must be immaterial because if it were material it\ncould not receive all forms. Just as the eye, because of its\nparticular physical nature, is sensitive to light but not to sound,\nand the ear to sound and not to light, so, if the intellect were in a\nphysical organ it could be sensitive only to a restricted range of\nphysical things; but this is not the case, for we can think about any\nkind of material object (De Anima III,4; 429a10\u2013b9). As\nit does not have a material organ, its activity must be essentially\nimmaterial.\n\n\nIt is common for modern Aristotelians, who otherwise have a high view\nof Aristotle\u2019s relevance to modern philosophy, to treat this argument\nas being of purely historical interest, and not essential to\nAristotle\u2019s system as a whole. They emphasize that he was not a\n\u2018Cartesian\u2019 dualist, because the intellect is an aspect of\nthe soul and the soul is the form of the body, not a separate\nsubstance. Kenny (1989) argues that Aristotle\u2019s theory of mind as form\ngives him an account similar to Ryle (1949), for it makes the soul\nequivalent to the dispositions possessed by a living body. This\n\u2018anti-Cartesian\u2019 approach to Aristotle arguably ignores\nthe fact that, for Aristotle, the form is the substance.\n\n\nThese issues might seem to be of purely historical interest. But we\nshall see in below, in section 4.5, that this is not so.\n\n\nThe identification of form and substance is a feature of Aristotle\u2019s\nsystem that Aquinas effectively exploits in this context, identifying\nsoul, intellect and form, and treating them as a substance. (See, for\nexample, Aquinas (1912), Part I, questions 75 and 76.) But though the\nform (and, hence, the intellect with which it is identical) are the\nsubstance of the human person, they are not the person itself. Aquinas\nsays that when one addresses prayers to a saint \u2013 other than the\nBlessed Virgin Mary, who is believed to retain her body in heaven and\nis, therefore, always a complete person \u2013 one should say, not, for\nexample, \u2018Saint Peter pray for us\u2019, but \u2018soul of Saint\nPeter pray for us\u2019. The soul, though an immaterial substance, is the\nperson only when united with its body. Without the body, those aspects\nof its personal memory that depend on images (which are held to be\ncorporeal) will be lost.(See Aquinas (1912), Part I, question 89.)\n\n\nThe more modern versions of dualism have their origin in Descartes\u2019\nMeditations, and in the debate that was consequent upon\nDescartes\u2019 theory. Descartes was a substance dualist. He\nbelieved that there were two kinds of substance: matter, of which the\nessential property is that it is spatially extended; and mind, of\nwhich the essential property is that it thinks. Descartes\u2019 conception\nof the relation between mind and body was quite different from that\nheld in the Aristotelian tradition. For Aristotle, there is no exact\nscience of matter. How matter behaves is essentially affected by the\nform that is in it. You cannot combine just any matter with any \nform \u2013 you cannot make a knife out of butter, nor a human being out\nof paper \u2013 so the nature of the matter is a necessary condition\nfor the nature of the substance. But the nature of the substance does\nnot follow from the nature of its matter alone: there is no\n\u2018bottom up\u2019 account of substances. Matter is a\ndeterminable made determinate by form. This was how Aristotle thought\nthat he was able to explain the connection of soul to body: a\nparticular soul exists as the organizing principle in a particular\nparcel of matter.\n\n\nThe belief in the relative indeterminacy of matter is one reason for\nAristotle\u2019s rejection of atomism. If matter is atomic, then it is\nalready a collection of determinate objects in its own right, and it\nbecomes natural to regard the properties of macroscopic substances as\nmere summations of the natures of the atoms.\n\n\nAlthough, unlike most of his fashionable contemporaries and immediate\nsuccessors, Descartes was not an atomist, he was, like the others, a\nmechanist about the properties of matter. Bodies are machines that\nwork according to their own laws. Except where there are minds\ninterfering with it, matter proceeds deterministically, in its own\nright. Where there are minds requiring to influence bodies, they must\nwork by \u2018pulling levers\u2019 in a piece of machinery that already\nhas its own laws of operation. This raises the question of where those\n\u2018levers\u2019 are in the body. Descartes opted for the pineal gland,\nmainly because it is not duplicated on both sides of the brain, so it\nis a candidate for having a unique, unifying function.\n\n\nThe main uncertainty that faced Descartes and his contemporaries,\nhowever, was not where interaction took place, but\nhow two things so different as thought and extension could\ninteract at all. This would be particularly mysterious if one had an\nimpact view of causal interaction, as would anyone influenced\nby atomism, for whom the paradigm of causation is like two billiard\nballs cannoning off one another.\n\n\nVarious of Descartes\u2019 disciples, such as Arnold Geulincx and Nicholas\nMalebranche, concluded that all mind-body interactions required the\ndirect intervention of God. The appropriate states of mind and body\nwere only the occasions for such intervention, not real\ncauses. Now it would be convenient to think that occasionalists held\nthat all causation was natural except for that between mind\nand body. In fact they generalized their conclusion and treated all\ncausation as directly dependent on God. Why this was so, we cannot\ndiscuss here.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 conception of a dualism of substances came under\nattack from the more radical empiricists, who found it difficult to\nattach sense to the concept of substance at all. Locke, as a moderate\nempiricist, accepted that there were both material and immaterial\nsubstances. Berkeley famously rejected material substance, because he\nrejected all existence outside the mind. In his early\nNotebooks, he toyed with the idea of rejecting immaterial\nsubstance, because we could have no idea of it, and reducing the self\nto a collection of the \u2018ideas\u2019 that constituted its contents. Finally,\nhe decided that the self, conceived as something over and above the\nideas of which it was aware, was essential for an adequate\nunderstanding of the human person. Although the self and its acts are\nnot presented to consciousness as objects of awareness, we are\nobliquely aware of them simply by dint of being active subjects. Hume\nrejected such claims, and proclaimed the self to be nothing more than a\nconcatenation of its ephemeral contents.\n\n\nIn fact, Hume criticised the whole conception of substance for\nlacking in empirical content: when you search for the owner of the\nproperties that make up a substance, you find nothing but further\nproperties. Consequently, the mind is, he claimed, nothing but a\n\u2018bundle\u2019 or \u2018heap\u2019 of impressions and \nideas \u2013 that is, of particular mental states or events, without an\nowner. This position has been labelled bundle dualism, and it\nis a special case of a general bundle theory of substance,\naccording to which objects in general are just organised collections of\nproperties. The problem for the Humean is to explain what binds the\nelements in the bundle together. This is an issue for any kind of\nsubstance, but for material bodies the solution seems fairly\nstraightforward: the unity of a physical bundle is constituted by some\nform of causal interaction between the elements in the bundle. For the\nmind, mere causal connection is not enough; some further relation of\nco-consciousness is required. We shall see in 5.2.1 that it is\nproblematic whether one can treat such a relation as more primitive\nthan the notion of belonging to a subject.\n\n\nOne should note the following about Hume\u2019s theory. His bundle theory\nis a theory about the nature of the unity of the mind. As a theory\nabout this unity, it is not necessarily dualist. Parfit (1970, 1984)\nand Shoemaker (1984, ch. 2), for example, accept it as physicalists. In\ngeneral, physicalists will accept it unless they wish to ascribe the\nunity to the brain or the organism as a whole. Before the bundle theory\ncan be dualist one must accept property dualism, for more\nabout which, see the next section.\n\n\nA crisis in the history of dualism came, however, with the growing\npopularity of mechanism in science in the nineteenth century.\nAccording to the mechanist, the world is, as it would now be expressed,\n\u2018closed under physics\u2019. This means that everything that\nhappens follows from and is in accord with the laws of physics. There\nis, therefore, no scope for interference in the physical world by the\nmind in the way that interactionism seems to require. According to the\nmechanist, the conscious mind is an epiphenomenon (a notion\ngiven general currency by T. H. Huxley 1893): that is, it is a\nby-product of the physical system which has no influence back on it. In\nthis way, the facts of consciousness are acknowledged but the integrity\nof physical science is preserved. However, many philosophers found it\nimplausible to claim such things as the following; the pain that I have\nwhen you hit me, the visual sensations I have when I see the ferocious\nlion bearing down on me or the conscious sense of understanding I have\nwhen I hear your argument \u2013 all have nothing directly to do with\nthe way I respond. It is very largely due to the need to avoid this\ncounterintuitiveness that we owe the concern of twentieth century\nphilosophy to devise a plausible form of materialist monism. But,\nalthough dualism has been out of fashion in psychology since the advent\nof behaviourism (Watson 1913) and in philosophy since Ryle (1949),\nthe argument is by no means over. Some distinguished neurologists, such\nas Sherrington (1940) and Eccles (Popper and Eccles 1977) have\ncontinued to defend dualism as the only theory that can preserve the\ndata of consciousness. Amongst mainstream philosophers, discontent with\nphysicalism led to a modest revival of property dualism in the last\ndecade of the twentieth century. At least some of the reasons for this\nshould become clear below.\n2. Varieties of Dualism: Ontology\n\n\nThere are various ways of dividing up kinds of dualism. One natural\nway is in terms of what sorts of things one chooses to be dualistic\nabout. The most common categories lighted upon for these purposes are\nsubstance and property, giving one substance\ndualism and property dualism. There is, however, an\nimportant third category, namely predicate dualism. As this\nlast is the weakest theory, in the sense that it claims least, I shall\nbegin by characterizing it.\n2.1 Predicate dualism\n\n\nPredicate dualism is the theory that psychological or mentalistic\npredicates are (a) essential for a full description of the world and\n(b) are not reducible to physicalistic predicates. For a mental\npredicate to be reducible, there would be bridging laws connecting\ntypes of psychological states to types of physical ones in such a way\nthat the use of the mental predicate carried no information that could\nnot be expressed without it. An example of what we believe to be a\ntrue type reduction outside psychology is the case of water, where\nwater is always H2O: something is water if and only if it\nis H2O. If one were to replace the word \u2018water\u2019\nby \u2018H2O\u2019, it is plausible to say that one could\nconvey all the same information. But the terms in many of the special\nsciences (that is, any science except physics itself) are not\nreducible in this way. Not every hurricane or every\ninfectious disease, let alone every devaluation of the\ncurrency or every coup d\u2019etat has the same constitutive\nstructure. These states are defined more by what they do than\nby their composition or structure. Their names are classified\nas functional terms rather than natural kind\nterms. It goes with this that such kinds of state are\nmultiply realizable; that is, they may be constituted by\ndifferent kinds of physical structures under different\ncircumstances. Because of this, unlike in the case of water and\nH2O, one could not replace these terms by some more basic\nphysical description and still convey the same information. There is\nno particular description, using the language of physics or chemistry,\nthat would do the work of the word \u2018hurricane\u2019, in the way\nthat \u2018H2O\u2019 would do the work of\n\u2018water\u2019. It is widely agreed that many, if not all,\npsychological states are similarly irreducible, and so psychological\npredicates are not reducible to physical descriptions and one has\npredicate dualism. (The classic source for irreducibility in the\nspecial sciences in general is Fodor (1974), and for irreducibility in\nthe philosophy of mind, Davidson (1971).)\n2.2 Property Dualism\n\n\nWhereas predicate dualism says that there are two essentially\ndifferent kinds of predicates in our language,\nproperty dualism says that there are two essentially different kinds of\nproperty out in the world. Property dualism can be seen as a\nstep stronger than predicate dualism. Although the predicate\n\u2018hurricane\u2019 is not equivalent to any single description\nusing the language of physics, we believe that each individual\nhurricane is nothing but a collection of physical atoms\nbehaving in a certain way: one need have no more than the physical\natoms, with their normal physical properties, following normal physical\nlaws, for there to be a hurricane. One might say that we need more than\nthe language of physics to describe and explain the weather,\nbut we do not need more than its ontology. There is token\nidentity between each individual hurricane and a mass of atoms,\neven if there is no type identity between hurricanes as kinds\nand some particular structure of atoms as a kind. Genuine property\ndualism occurs when, even at the individual level, the ontology of\nphysics is not sufficient to constitute what is there. The irreducible\nlanguage is not just another way of describing what there is, it\nrequires that there be something more there than was allowed for in the\ninitial ontology. Until the early part of the twentieth century, it was\ncommon to think that biological phenomena (\u2018life\u2019) required\nproperty dualism (an irreducible \u2018vital force\u2019), but nowadays the\nspecial physical sciences other than psychology are generally thought\nto involve only predicate dualism. In the case of mind, property\ndualism is defended by those who argue that the qualitative nature of\nconsciousness is not merely another way of categorizing states of the\nbrain or of behaviour, but a genuinely emergent phenomenon.\n2.3 Substance Dualism\n\n\nThere are two important concepts deployed in this notion. One is\nthat of substance, the other is the dualism of these\nsubstances. A substance is characterized by its properties, but,\naccording to those who believe in substances, it is more than the\ncollection of the properties it possesses, it is the thing\nwhich possesses them. So the mind is not just a collection of\nthoughts, but is that which thinks, an immaterial substance\nover and above its immaterial states. Properties are the properties of\nobjects. If one is a property dualist, one may wonder what\nkinds of objects possess the irreducible or immaterial properties in\nwhich one believes. One can use a neutral expression and attribute them\nto persons, but, until one has an account of person,\nthis is not explanatory. One might attribute them to human beings\nqua animals, or to the brains of these animals. Then one will\nbe holding that these immaterial properties are possessed by what is\notherwise a purely material thing. But one may also think that not only\nmental states are immaterial, but that the subject that possesses them\nmust also be immaterial. Then one will be a dualist about that to\nwhich mental states and properties belong as well about the\nproperties themselves. Now one might try to think of these subjects as\njust bundles of the immaterial states. This is Hume\u2019s view. But if one\nthinks that the owner of these states is something quite over and above\nthe states themselves, and is immaterial, as they are, one will be a\nsubstance dualist.\n\n\nSubstance dualism is also often dubbed \u2018Cartesian\ndualism\u2019, but some substance dualists are keen to distinguish\ntheir theories from Descartes\u2019s. E. J. Lowe, for example, is a\nsubstance dualist, in the following sense. He holds that a normal\nhuman being involves two substances, one a body and the other a\nperson. The latter is not, however, a purely mental substance that can\nbe defined in terms of thought or consciousness alone, as Descartes\nclaimed. But persons and their bodies have different identity\nconditions and are both substances, so there are two substances\nessentially involved in a human being, hence this is a form of\nsubstance dualism. Lowe (2006) claims that his theory is close to\nP. F. Strawson\u2019s (1959), whilst admitting that Strawson would not have\ncalled it substance dualism.\n3. Varieties of Dualism: Interaction\n\n\nIf mind and body are different realms, in the way required by either\nproperty or substance dualism, then there arises the question of how\nthey are related. Common sense tells us that they interact: thoughts\nand feelings are at least sometimes caused by bodily events and at\nleast sometimes themselves give rise to bodily responses. I shall now\nconsider briefly the problems for interactionism, and its main rivals,\nepiphenomenalism and parallelism.\n3.1 Interactionism\n\n\nInteractionism is the view that mind and body \u2013 or mental\nevents and physical events \u2013 causally influence each other. That\nthis is so is one of our common-sense beliefs, because it appears to be\na feature of everyday experience. The physical world influences my\nexperience through my senses, and I often react behaviourally to those\nexperiences. My thinking, too, influences my speech and my actions.\nThere is, therefore, a massive natural prejudice in favour of\ninteractionism. It has been claimed, however, that it faces serious\nproblems (some of which were anticipated in section 1).\n\n\nThe simplest objection to interaction is that, in so far as mental\nproperties, states or substances are of radically different kinds from\neach other, they lack that communality necessary for interaction. It is\ngenerally agreed that, in its most naive form, this objection to\ninteractionism rests on a \u2018billiard ball\u2019 picture of\ncausation: if all causation is by impact, how can the material and the\nimmaterial impact upon each other? But if causation is either by a more\nethereal force or energy or only a matter of constant conjunction,\nthere would appear to be no problem in principle with the idea of\ninteraction of mind and body.\n\n\nEven if there is no objection in principle, there appears to be a\nconflict between interactionism and some basic principles of physical\nscience. For example, if causal power was flowing in and out of the\nphysical system, energy would not be conserved, and the conservation\nof energy is a fundamental scientific law. Various responses have been\nmade to this. One suggestion is that it might be possible for mind to\ninfluence the distribution of energy, without altering its\nquantity. (See Averill and Keating 1981). Another response is to\nchallenge the relevance of the conservation principle in this context.\nThe conservation principle states that \u2018in a causally isolated\nsystem the total amount of energy will remain constant\u2019. Whereas\n\u2018[t]he interactionist denies\u2026that the human body is an\nisolated system\u2019, so the principle is irrelevant (Larmer (1986),\n282: this article presents a good brief survey of the options). This\napproach has been termed conditionality, namely the view that\nconservation is conditional on the physical system being closed, that\nis, that nothing non-physical is interacting or interfering with it,\nand, of course, the interactionist claims that this condition is,\ntrivially, not met. That conditionality is the best line for the\ndualist to take, and that other approaches do not work, is defended in\nPitts (2019) and Cucu and Pitts (2019). This, they claim, makes the\nplausibility of interactionism an empirical matter which only close\ninvestigation on the fine operation of the brain could hope to\nsettle. Cucu, in a separate article (2018), claims to find critical\nneuronal events which do not have sufficient physical explanation.This\nclaim clearly needs further investigation.\n\n\nRobins Collins (2011) has claimed that the appeal to conservation by\nopponents of interactionism is something of a red herring because\nconservation principles are not ubiquitous in physics. He argues that\nenergy is not conserved in general relativity, in quantum theory, or\nin the universe taken as a whole. Why then, should we insist on it in\nmind-brain interaction?\n\n\nMost discussion of interactionism takes place in the context of the\nassumption that it is incompatible with the world\u2019s being \u2018closed\nunder physics\u2019. This is a very natural assumption, but it is not\njustified if causal overdetermination of behaviour is possible. There\ncould then be a complete physical cause of behaviour, and a mental one.\nThe strongest intuitive objection against overdetermination is clearly\nstated by Mills (1996: 112), who is himself a defender of\noverdetermination.\n\n\nFor X to be a cause of Y, X must contribute\nsomething to Y. The only way a purely mental event could\ncontribute to a purely physical one would be to contribute some\nfeature not already determined by a purely physical event. But if\nphysical closure is true, there is no feature of the purely physical\neffect that is not contributed by the purely physical cause. Hence\ninteractionism violates physical closure after all.\n\n\nMills says that this argument is invalid, because a physical event\ncan have features not explained by the event which is its sufficient\ncause. For example, \u201cthe rock\u2019s hitting the window is causally\nsufficient for the window\u2019s breaking, and the window\u2019s breaking has the\nfeature of being the third window-breaking in the house this year; but\nthe facts about prior window-breakings, rather than the rock\u2019s hitting\nthe window, are what cause this window-breaking to have this\nfeature.\u201d\n\n\nThe opponent of overdetermination could perhaps reply that his\nprinciple applies, not to every feature of events, but to a \nsubgroup \u2013 say, intrinsic features, not merely relational or comparative\nones. It is this kind of feature that the mental event would have to\ncause, but physical closure leaves no room for this. These matters are\nstill controversial.\n\n\nThe problem with closure of physics may be radically altered if\nphysical laws are indeterministic, as quantum theory seems to assert.\nIf physical laws are deterministic, then any interference from outside\nwould lead to a breach of those laws. But if they are indeterministic,\nmight not interference produce a result that has a probability greater\nthan zero, and so be consistent with the laws? This way, one might have\ninteraction yet preserve a kind of nomological closure, in the sense\nthat no laws are infringed. Because it involves assessing the\nsignificance and consequences of quantum theory, this is a difficult\nmatter for the non-physicist to assess. Some argue that indeterminacy\nmanifests itself only on the subatomic level, being cancelled out by\nthe time one reaches even very tiny macroscopic objects: and human\nbehaviour is a macroscopic phenomenon. Others argue that the structure\nof the brain is so finely tuned that minute variations could have\nmacroscopic effects, rather in the way that, according to \u2018chaos\ntheory\u2019, the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings in China might affect the\nweather in New York. (For discussion of this, see Eccles (1980),\n(1987), and Popper and Eccles (1977).) Still others argue that quantum\nindeterminacy manifests itself directly at a high level, when acts of\nobservation collapse the wave function, suggesting that the mind may\nplay a direct role in affecting the state of the world (Hodgson\n1988; Stapp 1993).\n3.2 Epiphenomenalism\n\n\nIf the reality of property dualism is not to be denied, but the\nproblem of how the immaterial is to affect the material is to be\navoided, then epiphenomenalism may seem to be the answer. According to\nthis theory, mental events are caused by physical events, but have no\ncausal influence on the physical. I have introduced this theory as if\nits point were to avoid the problem of how two different categories of\nthing might interact. In fact, it is, at best, an incomplete solution\nto this problem. If it is mysterious how the non-physical can have it\nin its nature to influence the physical, it ought to be equally\nmysterious how the physical can have it in its nature to produce\nsomething non-physical. But that this latter is what occurs is an\nessential claim of epiphenomenalism. (For development of this point,\nsee Green (2003), 149\u201351). In fact, epiphenomenalism is more effective\nas a way of saving the autonomy of the physical (the world as\n\u2018closed under physics\u2019) than as a contribution to avoiding the\nneed for the physical and non-physical to have causal commerce.\n\n\nThere are at least three serious problems for epiphenomenalism.\nFirst, as I indicated in section 1, it is profoundly\ncounterintuitive. What could be more apparent than that it is the pain\nthat I feel that makes me cry, or the visual experience of the boulder\nrolling towards me that makes me run away? At least one can say that\nepiphenomenalism is a fall-back position: it tends to be adopted\nbecause other options are held to be unacceptable.\n\n\nThe second problem is that, if mental states do nothing, there is no\nreason why they should have evolved. This objection ties in with the\nfirst: the intuition there was that conscious states clearly modify our\nbehaviour in certain ways, such as avoiding danger, and it is plain\nthat they are very useful from an evolutionary perspective.\n\n\nFrank Jackson (1982) replies to this objection by saying that it is\nthe brain state associated with pain that evolves for this reason: the\nsensation is a by-product. Evolution is full of useless or even harmful\nby-products. For example, polar bears have evolved thick coats to keep\nthem warm, even though this has the damaging side effect that they are\nheavy to carry. Jackson\u2019s point is true in general, but does not seem\nto apply very happily to the case of mind. The heaviness of the polar\nbear\u2019s coat follows directly from those properties and laws which make\nit warm: one could not, in any simple way, have one without the other.\nBut with mental states, dualistically conceived, the situation is quite\nthe opposite. The laws of physical nature which, the mechanist says,\nmake brain states cause behaviour, in no way explain why brain states\nshould give rise to conscious ones. The laws linking mind and brain are\nwhat Feigl (1958) calls nomological danglers, that is, brute\nfacts added onto the body of integrated physical law. Why there should\nhave been by-products of that kind seems to have no\nevolutionary explanation.\n\n\nThe third problem concerns the rationality of belief in\nepiphenomenalism, via its effect on the problem of other\nminds. It is natural to say that I know that I have mental states\nbecause I experience them directly. But how can I justify my belief\nthat others have them? The simple version of the \u2018argument from\nanalogy\u2019 says that I can extrapolate from my own case. I know\nthat certain of my mental states are correlated with certain pieces of\nbehaviour, and so I infer that similar behaviour in others is also\naccompanied by similar mental states. Many hold that this is a weak\nargument because it is induction from one instance, namely, my own. The\nargument is stronger if it is not a simple induction but an\n\u2018argument to the best explanation\u2019. I seem to know from my\nown case that mental events can be the explanation of behaviour, and I\nknow of no other candidate explanation for typical human behaviour, so\nI postulate the same explanation for the behaviour of others. But if\nepiphenomenalism is true, my mental states do not explain my behaviour\nand there is a physical explanation for the behaviour of others. It is\nexplanatorily redundant to postulate such states for others. I know, by\nintrospection, that I have them, but is it not just as likely that I\nalone am subject to this quirk of nature, rather than that everyone\nis?\n\nFor more detailed treatment and further reading on this topic, see the\nentry\n epiphenomenalism.\n \n\n3.3 Parallelism\n\n\nThe epiphenomenalist wishes to preserve the integrity of physical\nscience and the physical world, and appends those mental features that\nhe cannot reduce. The parallelist preserves both realms intact, but\ndenies all causal interaction between them. They run in harmony with\neach other, but not because their mutual influence keeps each other in\nline. That they should behave as if they were interacting\nwould seem to be a bizarre coincidence. This is why parallelism has\ntended to be adopted only by those \u2013 like Leibniz \u2013 who\nbelieve in a pre-established harmony, set in place by God. The\nprogression of thought can be seen as follows. Descartes believes in a\nmore or less natural form of interaction between immaterial mind and\nmaterial body. Malebranche thought that this was impossible naturally,\nand so required God to intervene specifically on each occasion on which\ninteraction was required. Leibniz decided that God might as well set\nthings up so that they always behaved as if they were\ninteracting, without particular intervention being required. Outside\nsuch a theistic framework, the theory is incredible. Even within such a\nframework, one might well sympathise with Berkeley\u2019s instinct that once\ngenuine interaction is ruled out one is best advised to allow that God\ncreates the physical world directly, within the mental realm itself, as\na construct out of experience.\n4. Arguments for Dualism\n4.1 The Knowledge Argument Against Physicalism\n\n\nOne category of arguments for dualism is constituted by the standard\nobjections against physicalism. Prime examples are those based on the\nexistence of qualia, the most important of which is the so-called\n\u2018knowledge argument\u2019. Because this argument has its own\nentry (see the entry\n qualia: the knowledge argument),\n I shall deal relatively briefly with it here.  One should bear in\nmind, however, that all arguments against physicalism are also\narguments for the irreducible and hence immaterial nature of the mind\nand, given the existence of the material world, are thus arguments\nfor dualism.\n\n\nThe knowledge argument asks us to imagine a future scientist who has\nlacked a certain sensory modality from birth, but who has acquired a\nperfect scientific understanding of how this modality operates in\nothers. This scientist \u2013 call him Harpo \u2013 may have been\nborn stone deaf, but become the world\u2019s greatest expert on the\nmachinery of hearing: he knows everything that there is to know within\nthe range of the physical and behavioural sciences about hearing.\nSuppose that Harpo, thanks to developments in neurosurgery, has an\noperation which finally enables him to hear. It is suggested that he\nwill then learn something he did not know before, which can be\nexpressed as what it is like to hear, or the\nqualitative or phenomenal nature of sound. These\nqualitative features of experience are generally referred to as\nqualia. If Harpo learns something new, he did not know\neverything before. He knew all the physical facts before. So what he\nlearns on coming to hear \u2013 the facts about the nature of\nexperience or the nature of qualia \u2013 are non-physical. This\nestablishes at least a state or property dualism. (See Jackson 1982;\nRobinson 1982.)\n\n\nThere are at least two lines of response to this popular but\ncontroversial argument. First is the \u2018ability\u2019 response.\nAccording to this, Harpo does not acquire any new factual knowledge,\nonly \u2018knowledge how\u2019, in the form of the ability to respond\ndirectly to sounds, which he could not do before. This essentially\nbehaviouristic account is exactly what the intuition behind the\nargument is meant to overthrow. Putting ourselves in Harpo\u2019s position,\nit is meant to be obvious that what he acquires is knowledge of what\nsomething is like, not just how to do something. Such\nappeals to intuition are always, of course, open to denial by those who\nclaim not to share the intuition. Some ability theorists seem to blur\nthe distinction between knowing what something is like and knowing how\nto do something, by saying that the ability Harpo acquires is to\nimagine or remember the nature of sound. In this\ncase, what he acquires the ability to do involves the\nrepresentation to himself of what the thing is like. But this\nconception of representing to oneself, especially in the form of\nimagination, seems sufficiently close to producing in oneself something\nvery like a sensory experience that it only defers the problem: until\none has a physicalist gloss on what constitutes such representations as\nthose involved in conscious memory and imagination, no progress has\nbeen made.\n\n\nThe other line of response is to argue that, although Harpo\u2019s new\nknowledge is factual, it is not knowledge of a new fact. Rather, it is\nnew way of grasping something that he already knew. He does not realise\nthis, because the concepts employed to capture experience (such as\n\u2018looks red\u2019 or \u2018sounds C-sharp\u2019) are similar to\ndemonstratives, and demonstrative concepts lack the kind of descriptive\ncontent that allow one to infer what they express from other pieces of\ninformation that one may already possess. A total scientific knowledge\nof the world would not enable you to say which time was\n\u2018now\u2019 or which place was \u2018here\u2019. Demonstrative\nconcepts pick something out without saying anything extra about it.\nSimilarly, the scientific knowledge that Harpo originally possessed did\nnot enable him to anticipate what it would be like to re-express some\nparts of that knowledge using the demonstrative concepts that only\nexperience can give one. The knowledge, therefore, appears to be\ngenuinely new, whereas only the mode of conceiving it is novel.\n\n\nProponents of the epistemic argument respond that it is problematic\nto maintain both that the qualitative nature of experience can be\ngenuinely novel, and that the quality itself be the same as some\nproperty already grasped scientifically: does not the experience\u2019s\nphenomenal nature, which the demonstrative concepts capture, constitute\na property in its own right? Another way to put this is to say that\nphenomenal concepts are not pure demonstratives, like\n\u2018here\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019, or \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018that\u2019, because they do capture a genuine qualitative\ncontent. Furthermore, experiencing does not seem to consist simply in\nexercising a particular kind of concept, demonstrative or not. When\nHarpo has his new form of experience, he does not simply exercise a new\nconcept; he also grasps something new \u2013 the phenomenal \nquality \u2013 with that concept. How decisive these considerations are,\nremains controversial.\n4.2 The Argument from Predicate Dualism to Property Dualism\n\n\nI said above that predicate dualism might seem to have no\nontological consequences, because it is concerned only with the\ndifferent way things can be described within the contexts of the\ndifferent sciences, not with any real difference in the things\nthemselves. This, however, can be disputed.\n\n\nThe argument from predicate to property dualism moves in two steps,\nboth controversial. The first claims that the irreducible special\nsciences, which are the sources of irreducible predicates, are not\nwholly objective in the way that physics is, but depend for their\nsubject matter upon interest-relative perspectives on the world. This\nmeans that they, and the predicates special to them, depend on the\nexistence of minds and mental states, for only minds have\ninterest-relative perspectives. The second claim is that \npsychology \u2013 the science of the mental \u2013 is itself an irreducible\nspecial science, and so it, too, presupposes the existence of the\nmental. Mental predicates therefore presuppose the mentality that\ncreates them: mentality cannot consist simply in the applicability of\nthe predicates themselves.\n\n\nFirst, let us consider the claim that the special sciences are not\nfully objective, but are interest-relative.\n\n\nNo-one would deny, of course, that the very same subject matter or\n\u2018hunk of reality\u2019 can be described in irreducibly different\nways and it still be just that subject matter or piece of reality. A\nmass of matter could be characterized as a hurricane, or as a\ncollection of chemical elements, or as mass of sub-atomic particles,\nand there be only the one mass of matter. But such different\nexplanatory frameworks seem to presuppose different perspectives on\nthat subject matter.\n\n\nThis is where basic physics, and perhaps those sciences reducible to\nbasic physics, differ from irreducible special sciences. On a realist\nconstrual, the completed physics cuts physical reality up at its\nultimate joints: any special science which is nomically strictly\nreducible to physics also, in virtue of this reduction, it could be\nargued, cuts reality at its joints, but not at its minutest ones. If\nscientific realism is true, a completed physics will tell one how the\nworld is, independently of any special interest or concern: it is just\nhow the world is. It would seem that, by contrast, a science\nwhich is not nomically reducible to physics does not take its\nlegitimation from the underlying reality in this direct way. Rather,\nsuch a science is formed from the collaboration between, on the one\nhand, objective similarities in the world and, on the other,\nperspectives and interests of those who devise the science. The concept\nof hurricane is brought to bear from the perspective of creatures\nconcerned about the weather. Creatures totally indifferent to the\nweather would have no reason to take the real patterns of phenomena\nthat hurricanes share as constituting a single kind of thing. With the\nirreducible special sciences, there is an issue of salience ,\nwhich involves a subjective component: a selection of\nphenomena with a certain teleology in mind is required before\ntheir structures or patterns are reified. The entities of metereology\nor biology are, in this respect, rather like Gestalt\nphenomena.\n\n\nEven accepting this, why might it be thought that the\nperspectivality of the special sciences leads to a genuine property\ndualism in the philosophy of mind? It might seem to do so for the\nfollowing reason. Having a perspective on the world, perceptual or\nintellectual, is a psychological state. So the irreducible special\nsciences presuppose the existence of mind. If one is to avoid an\nontological dualism, the mind that has this perspective must be part of\nthe physical reality on which it has its perspective. But psychology,\nit seems to be almost universally agreed, is one of those special\nsciences that is not reducible to physics, so if its subject matter is\nto be physical, it itself presupposes a perspective and, hence, the\nexistence of a mind to see matter as psychological. If this\nmind is physical and irreducible, it presupposes mind to see it as\nsuch. We seem to be in a vicious circle or regress.\n\n\nWe can now understand the motivation for full-blown reduction. A\ntrue basic physics represents the world as it is in itself, and if the\nspecial sciences were reducible, then the existence of their ontologies\nwould make sense as expressions of the physical, not just as ways of\nseeing or interpreting it. They could be understood \u2018from the\nbottom up\u2019, not from top down. The irreducibility of the special\nsciences creates no problem for the dualist, who sees the explanatory\nendeavor of the physical sciences as something carried on from a\nperspective conceptually outside of the physical world. Nor need this\nworry a physicalist, if he can reduce psychology, for then he\ncould understand \u2018from the bottom up\u2019 the acts (with their\ninternal, intentional contents) which created the irreducible\nontologies of the other sciences. But psychology is one of the least\nlikely of sciences to be reduced. If psychology cannot be reduced, this\nline of reasoning leads to real emergence for mental acts and hence to\na real dualism for the properties those acts instantiate (Robinson\n2003).\n4.3 The Modal Argument\n\n\nThere is an argument, which has roots in Descartes (Meditation\nVI), which is a modal argument for dualism. One might put it as\nfollows:\n\nIt is imaginable that one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nIt is conceivable that one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nIt is possible one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nOne\u2019s mind is a different entity from one\u2019s body.\n\n\n\nThe rationale of the argument is a move from imaginability to real\npossibility. I include (2) because the notion of conceivability has one\nfoot in the psychological camp, like imaginability, and one in the camp\nof pure logical possibility and therefore helps in the transition from\none to the other.\n\n\nThis argument should be distinguished from a similar\n\u2018conceivability\u2019 argument, often known as the \u2018zombie\nhypothesis\u2019, which claims the imaginability and possibility of my\nbody (or, in some forms, a body physically just like it) existing\nwithout there being any conscious states associated with it. (See, for\nexample, Chalmers (1996), 94\u20139.) This latter argument, if sound, would\nshow that conscious states were something over and above physical\nstates. It is a different argument because the hypothesis that\nthe unaltered body could exist without the mind is not the\nsame as the suggestion that the mind might continue to exist without\nthe body, nor are they trivially equivalent. The zombie argument\nestablishes only property dualism and a property dualist might think\ndisembodied existence inconceivable \u2013 for example, if he thought\nthe identity of a mind through time depended on its relation to a body\n(e.g., Penelhum 1970).\n\n\nBefore Kripke (1972/80), the first challenge to such an argument\nwould have concerned the move from (3) to (4). When philosophers\ngenerally believed in contingent identity, that move seemed to them\ninvalid. But nowadays that inference is generally accepted and the\nissue concerns the relation between imaginability and possibility.\nNo-one would nowadays identify the two (except, perhaps, for certain\nquasi-realists and anti-realists), but the view that imaginability is a\nsolid test for possibility has been strongly defended. W. D. Hart\n((1994), 266), for example, argues that no clear example has been\nproduced such that \u201cone can imagine that p (and tell less\nimaginative folk a story that enables them to imagine that p) plus a\ngood argument that it is impossible that p. No such counterexamples\nhave been forthcoming\u2026\u201d This claim is at least contentious.\nThere seem to be good arguments that time-travel is incoherent, but\nevery episode of Star-Trek or Doctor Who shows how\none can imagine what it might be like were it possible.\n\n\nIt is worth relating the appeal to possibility in this argument to\nthat involved in the more modest, anti-physicalist, zombie argument.\nThe possibility of this hypothesis is also challenged, but all that is\nnecessary for a zombie to be possible is that all and only the things\nthat the physical sciences say about the body be true of such a\ncreature. As the concepts involved in such sciences \u2013 e.g.,\nneuron, cell, muscle \u2013 seem to make no reference, explicit or\nimplicit, to their association with consciousness, and are defined in\npurely physical terms in the relevant science texts, there is a very\npowerful prima facie case for thinking that something could meet the\ncondition of being just like them and lack any connection with\nconsciousness. There is no parallel clear, uncontroversial and\nregimented account of mental concepts as a whole that fails to invoke,\nexplicitly or implicitly, physical (e.g., behavioural) states.\n\n\nFor an analytical behaviourist the appeal to imaginability made in\nthe argument fails, not because imagination is not a reliable guide to\npossibility, but because we cannot imagine such a thing, as it is a\npriori impossible. The impossibility of disembodiment is rather like\nthat of time travel, because it is demonstrable a priori, though only\nby arguments that are controversial. The argument can only get under\nway for those philosophers who accept that the issue cannot be settled\na priori, so the possibility of the disembodiment that we can imagine\nis still prima facie open.\n\n\nA major rationale of those who think that imagination is not a safe\nindication of possibility, even when such possibility is not eliminable\na priori, is that we can imagine that a posteriori necessities\nmight be false \u2013 for example, that Hesperus might not be\nidentical to Phosphorus. But if Kripke is correct, that is not a real\npossibility. Another way of putting this point is that there are many\nepistemic possibilities which are imaginable because they are epistemic\npossibilities, but which are not real possibilities. Richard Swinburne\n(1997, New Appendix C), whilst accepting this argument in general, has\ninteresting reasons for thinking that it cannot apply in the mind-body\ncase. He argues that in cases that involve a posteriori necessities,\nsuch as those identities that need discovering, it is because we\nidentify those entities only by their \u2018stereotypes\u2019 (that\nis, by their superficial features observable by the layman) that we can\nbe wrong about their essences. In the case of our experience of\nourselves this is not true.\n\n\nNow it is true that the essence of Hesperus cannot be discovered by\na mere thought experiment. That is because what makes Hesperus Hesperus\nis not the stereotype, but what underlies it. But it does not follow\nthat no one can ever have access to the essence of a substance, but\nmust always rely for identification on a fallible stereotype. One might\nthink that for the person him or herself, while what makes that person\nthat person underlies what is observable to others, it does not\nunderlie what is experienceable by that person, but is given directly in\ntheir own self-awareness.\n\n\nThis is a very appealing Cartesian intuition: my identity as the\nthinking thing that I am is revealed to me in consciousness, it is not\nsomething beyond the veil of consciousness. Now it could be replied to\nthis that though I do access myself as a conscious subject, so\nclassifying myself is rather like considering myself qua\ncyclist. Just as I might never have been a cyclist, I might never have\nbeen conscious, if things had gone wrong in my very early life.\nI am the organism, the animal, which might not have developed\nto the point of consciousness, and that essence as animal is not\nrevealed to me just by introspection.\n\n\nBut there are vital differences between these cases. A cyclist is\nexplicitly presented as a human being (or creature of some\nother animal species) cycling: there is no temptation to think of a\ncyclist as a basic kind of thing in its own right. Consciousness is not\npresented as a property of something, but as the subject itself.\nSwinburne\u2019s claim that when we refer to ourselves we are referring to\nsomething we think we are directly aware of and not to \u2018something\nwe know not what\u2019 that underlies our experience seemingly\n\u2018of ourselves\u2019 has powerful intuitive appeal and could only\nbe overthrown by very forceful arguments. Yet, even if we are not\nreferring primarily to a substrate, but to what is revealed in\nconsciousness, could it not still be the case that there is a necessity\nstronger than causal connecting this consciousness to something\nphysical? To consider this further we must investigate what the limits\nare of the possible analogy between cases of the water-H2O kind, and\nthe mind-body relation.\n\n\nWe start from the analogy between the water stereotype \u2013 how\nwater presents itself \u2013 and how consciousness is given\nfirst-personally to the subject. It is plausible to claim that\nsomething like water could exist without being H2O, but hardly that it\ncould exist without some underlying nature. There is, however,\nno reason to deny that this underlying nature could be\nhomogenous with its manifest nature: that is, it would seem to be\npossible that there is a world in which the water-like stuff is an\nelement, as the ancients thought, and is water-like all the way down.\nThe claim of the proponents of the dualist argument is that this latter\nkind of situation can be known to be true a priori in the case of the\nmind: that is, one can tell by introspection that it is not\nmore-than-causally dependent on something of a radically different\nnature, such as a brain or body. What grounds might one have for\nthinking that one could tell that a priori?\n\n\nThe only general argument that seem to be available for this would be\nthe principle that, for any two levels of discourse, A and\nB, they are more-than-causally connected only if one entails\nthe other a priori. And the argument for accepting this principle\nwould be that the relatively uncontroversial cases of a posteriori\nnecessary connections are in fact cases in which one can argue a\npriori from facts about the microstructure to the manifest facts. In\nthe case of water, for example, it would be claimed that it follows a\npriori that if there were something with the properties\nattributed to H2O by chemistry on a micro level, then that\nthing would possess waterish properties on a macro level. What is\nestablished a posteriori is that it is in fact H2O that\nunderlies and explains the waterish properties round here, not\nsomething else: the sufficiency of the base \u2013 were it to \nobtain \u2013 to explain the phenomena, can be deduced a priori from the\nsupposed nature of the base. This is, in effect, the argument that\nChalmers uses to defend the zombie hypothesis. The suggestion is that\nthe whole category of a posteriori more-than-causally necessary\nconnections (often identified as a separate category of\nmetaphysical necessity) comes to no more than this. If we\naccept that this is the correct account of a posteriori necessities,\nand also deny the analytically reductionist theories that would be\nnecessary for a priori connections between mind and body, as\nconceived, for example, by the behaviourist or the functionalist, does\nit follow that we can tell a priori that consciousness is not\nmore-than-causally dependent on the body?\n\n\nIt is helpful in considering this question to employ a distinction\nlike Berkeley\u2019s between ideas and notions. Ideas are\nthe objects of our mental acts, and they capture \ntransparently \u2013 \u2018by way of image or likeness\u2019 \n(Principles, sect. 27) \u2013 that of which they are the ideas. \nThe self and its faculties\nare not the objects of our mental acts, but are captured only\nobliquely in the performance of its acts, and of these\nBerkeley says we have notions, meaning by this that what we\ncapture of the nature of the dynamic agent does not seem to have the\nsame transparency as what we capture as the normal objects of the\nagent\u2019s mental acts. It is not necessary to become involved in\nBerkeley\u2019s metaphysics in general to feel the force of the claim that\nthe contents and internal objects of our mental acts are grasped with a\nlucidity that exceeds that of our grasp of the agent and the acts\nper se. Because of this, notions of the self perhaps have a\n\u2018thickness\u2019 and are permanently contestable: there seems\nalways to be room for more dispute as to what is involved in that\nconcept. (Though we shall see later, in 5.2.2, that there is a\n\u2018non-thick\u2019 way of taking the Berkeleyan concept of a\nnotion.)\n\n\nBecause \u2018thickness\u2019 always leaves room for dispute, this\nis one of those cases in philosophy in which one is at the mercy of the\narguments philosophers happen to think up. The conceivability argument\ncreates a prima facie case for thinking that mind has no more than\ncausal ontological dependence on the body. Let us assume that one\nrejects analytical (behaviourist or functionalist) accounts of mental\npredicates. Then the above arguments show that any necessary dependence\nof mind on body does not follow the model that applies in other\nscientific cases. This does not show that there may not be other\nreasons for believing in such dependence, for so many of the concepts\nin the area are still contested. For example, it might be argued that\nidentity through time requires the kind of spatial existence that only\nbody can give: or that the causal continuity required by a stream of\nconsciousness cannot be a property of mere phenomena. All these might\nbe put forward as ways of filling out those aspects of our\nunderstanding of the self that are only obliquely, not transparently,\npresented in self-awareness. The dualist must respond to any claim as\nit arises: the conceivability argument does not pre-empt them.\n4.4 From property dualism to substance dualism\n\n\nAll the arguments so far in this section have been either arguments\nfor property dualism only, or neutral between property and substance\ndualism. In this subsection, and in section 4.5 we will consider some\narguments that have been proposed in favour of substance dualism.The\nones in this section can be regarded as preliminaries to that in 4.5\nand they centre on discontent with property dualism in its Humean\nform. \n\n\nHume is generally credited with devising what is known as the \u2018bundle\u2019\ntheory of the self (Treatise Book I, Part IV, section VI),\naccording to which there are mental states, but no further subject or\nsubstance which possesses them. He famously expresses his theory as\nfollows.\n\u2026when I enter most intimately into what I\ncall myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or\nother, of heat or cold, light or shade,love or hatred, pain or\npleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a\nperception, and can never observe any thing but the\nperception.\n\n\nNevertheless, in the Appendix of the same work he expressed\ndissatisfaction with this account. Somewhat surprisingly, it is not\nvery clear just what his worry was, but it is expressed as follows:\nIn short there are two principles, which I cannot render\nconsistent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them,\nviz. that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences,\nand that the mind never perceives any real connection between\ndistinct existences.\n\n\nBerkeley had entertained a similar theory to the one found in Hume\u2019s\nmain text in his Philosophical Commentaries, (Notebook A, paras\n577\u201381), but later rejected it for the claim that we could have\na notion, though not an idea of the self. This\nBerkeleian view is expressed in more modern terms by John Foster.\nA natural response to Hume would be to say that, even if\nwe cannot detect ourselves apart from our perceptions (our conscious\nexperiences)we can at least detect ourselves in them \u2026 Surely I am\naware of [my experience], so to speak, from the inside \u2013 not as\nsomething presented, but as something which I have or as the\nexperiential state which I am in \u2026 and this is equivalent to saying\nthat I detect it by being aware of myself being visually aware. (1991:\n215)\n\n\nThere is a clash of intuitions here between which it is difficult to\narbitrate. There is an argument that is meant to favour the need for a\nsubject, as claimed by Berkeley and Foster.\n\nIf the bundle theory were true, then it should be possible to\nidentify mental events independently of, or prior to, identifying the\nperson or mind to which they belong.\nIt is not possible to identify mental events in this way.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe bundle theory is false.\n\n\n\nE. J. Lowe (1996) defends this argument and argues for (2) as follows.\nWhat is wrong with the [bundle] theory is that \u2026 it\npresupposes, untenably,that an account of the identity conditions of\npsychological modes can be provided which need not rely on reference\nto persons. But it emerges that the identity of any psychological mode\nturns on the identity of the person that possesses it. What this\nimplies is that psychological modes are essentially modes of persons,\nand correspondingly that persons can be conceived of as\nsubstances.\n\n\nTo say that, according to the bundle theory, the identity conditions\nof individual mental states must be independent of the identity of the\nperson who possesses them, is to say that their identity is\nindependent of the bundle to which they belong. Hume certainly thought\nsomething like this, for he thought that an impression might \u2018float\nfree\u2019 from the mind to which it belonged, but it is not obvious that a\nbundle theorist is forced to adopt this position. Perhaps the identity\nof a mental event is bound up with the complex to which it\nbelongs. That this is impossible certainly needs further argument.\n\n\nHume seems, however, in the main text to unconsciously make a\nconcession to the opposing view, namely the view that there must be\nsomething more than the items in the bundle to make up a mind. He says:\nThe mind is a kind of theatre where several perceptions\nsuccessively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away and\nmingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.\n\n\nTalk of the mind as a theatre is, of course, normally associated with\nthe Cartesian picture, and the invocation of any necessary medium,\narena or even a field hypostasize some kind of entity which binds the\ndifferent contents together and without which they would not be a\nsingle mind. Modern Humeans \u2013 such as Parfit (1971; 1984) or Dainton\n(2008) \u2013 replace the theatre with a co-consciousness relation. So the\nbundle theorist is perhaps not as restricted as Hume thought. The\nbundle consists of the objects of awareness and the\nco-consciousness relation (or relations) that hold between them,\nand I think that the modern bundle theorist would want to say that it\nis the nexus of co-consciousness relations that constitutes our sense\nof the subject and of the act of awareness of the object. This\ninvolves abandoning the second of Hume\u2019s principles. that the mind\ncan never perceive any connection between distinct existences,\nbecause the co-consciousness relation is something of which we are\naware. The Humean point then becomes that we mistake the nexus of\nrelations for a kind of entity, in a way similar to that in which,\nHume claims,we mistake the regular succession of similar impressions\nfor an entity called an enduring physical object. Whether this really\nmakes sense in the end is another matter. I think that it is dubious\nwhether it can accommodate the subject as agent, but it does\nmean that simple introspection probably cannot refute a sophisticated\nbundle theory in the way that Lowe and Foster want. Hume\u2019s original\nposition seems to make him deny that we have any \u2018sense of self\u2019 at\nall, whilst the version that allows for our awareness of the\nrelatedness accommodates it, but explains how it can be an\nillusion. The rejection of bundle dualism, therefore, requires more\nthan an appeal to our intuitive awareness of ourselves as subjects.We\nwill see in the next section how arguments that defend the simplicity\nof the self attempt to undercut the bundle theory.\n4.5 Arguments from Personal Identity\n\n\nThere is a long tradition, dating at least from Reid (1785),\nfor arguing that the identity of persons over time is not a matter of\nconvention or degree in the way that the identity of other (complex)\nsubstances is and that this shows that the self is a different kind of\nentity from any physical body. Criticism of these arguments and of the\nintuitions on which they rest, running from Hume to Parfit (1970:\n1984), have left us with an inconclusive clash of intuitions. The\nargument under consideration and which, possibly, has its first\nstatement in Madell (1981), does not concern identity through time, but\nthe consequences for identity of certain counterfactuals concerning\norigin. It can, perhaps, therefore, break the stalemate which faces the\ndebate over diachronic identity. The claim is that the broadly\nconventionalist ways which are used to deal with problem cases through\ntime for both persons and material objects, and which can also be\nemployed in cases of counterfactuals concerning origin for bodies,\ncannot be used for similar counterfactuals concerning persons or\nminds.\n\n\nConcerning ordinary physical objects, it is easy to imagine\ncounterfactual cases where questions of identity become problematic.\nTake the example of a particular table. We can scale counterfactual\nsuggestions as follows:\n\nThis table might have been made of ice.\nThis table might have been made of a different sort of wood.\nThis table might have been made of 95% of the wood it was made of\nand 5% of some other wood.\n\n\n\nThe first suggestion would normally be rejected as clearly false,\nbut there will come a point along the spectrum illustrated by (i) and\n(iii) and towards (iii) where the question of whether the hypothesised\ntable would be the same as the one that actually exists have no obvious\nanswer. It seems that the question of whether it \u2018really\u2019\nis the same one has no clear meaning: it is of, say, 75% the same\nmatter and of 25% different matter; these are the only genuine facts in\nthe case; the question of numerical identity can be decided in any\nconvenient fashion, or left unresolved. There will thus be a penumbra\nof counterfactual cases where the question of whether two things would\nbe the same is not a matter of fact.\n\n\nLet us now apply this thought to conscious subjects. Suppose that a\ngiven human individual had had origins different from those which he in\nfact had such that whether that difference affected who he was\nwas not obvious to intuition. What would count as such a case might be\na matter of controversy, but there must be one. Perhaps it is unclear\nwhether, if there had been a counterpart to Jones\u2019 body from the same\negg but a different though genetically identical sperm from the same\nfather, the person there embodied would have been Jones. Some\nphilosophers might regard it as obvious that sameness of sperm is\nessential to the identity of a human body and to personal identity. In\nthat case imagine a counterpart sperm in which some of the molecules in\nthe sperm are different; would that be the same sperm? If one pursues\nthe matter far enough there will be indeterminacy which will infect\nthat of the resulting body. There must therefore be some difference\nsuch that neither natural language nor intuition tells us whether the\ndifference alters the identity of the human body; a point, that is,\nwhere the question of whether we have the same body is not a matter of\nfact.\n\n\nHow one is to describe these cases is, in some respects, a matter of\ncontroversy. Some philosophers think one can talk of vague\nidentity or partial identity. Others think that such\nexpressions are nonsensical. There is no space to discuss this issue\nhere. It is enough to assume, however, that questions of how one is\nallowed to use the concept of identity effect only the care with which\none should characterize these cases, not any substantive matter of\nfact. There are cases of substantial overlap of constitution in which\nthat fact is the only bedrock fact in the case: there is no\nfurther fact about whether they are \u2018really\u2019 the same\nobject. If there were, then there would have to be a\nhaecceitas or thisness belonging to and individuating\neach complex physical object, and this I am assuming to be implausible\nif not unintelligible. (More about the conditions under which\nhaecceitas can make sense will be found below.)\n\n\nOne might plausibly claim that no similar overlap of\nconstitution can be applied to the counterfactual identity of\nminds. In Geoffrey Madell\u2019s (1981) words:\nBut while my present body can thus have its partial\ncounterpart in some possible world, my present consciousness cannot.\nAny present state of consciousness that I can imagine either is or is\nnot mine. There is no question of degree here. (91)\n\n\nWhy is this so? Imagine the case where we are not sure whether it\nwould have been Jones\u2019 body \u2013 and, hence, Jones \u2013 that\nwould have been created by the slightly modified sperm and the same\negg. Can we say, as we would for an object with no consciousness, that\nthe story something the same, something different is the whole\nstory: that overlap of constitution is all there is to it? For the\nJones body as such, this approach would do as well as for any other\nphysical object. But suppose Jones, in reflective mood, asks himself\n\u2018if that had happened, would I have existed?\u2019 There are at\nleast three answers he might give to himself. (i) I either would or\nwould not, but I cannot tell. (ii) There is no fact of the matter\nwhether I would or would not have existed: it is just a mis-posed\nquestion. (iii) In some ways, or to some degree, I would have, and in\nsome ways, or to some degree, I would not. The creature who would have\nexisted would have had a kind of overlap of psychic constitution with\nme.\n\n\nThe third answer parallels the response we would give in the case of\nbodies. But as an account of the subjective situation, it is arguable\nthat this makes no sense. Call the creature that would have emerged\nfrom the slightly modified sperm, \u2018Jones2\u2019. Is the overlap\nsuggestion that, just as, say 85% of Jones2\u2019s original body would have\nbeen identical with Jones\u2019, about 85% of his psychic life would have\nbeen Jones\u2019? That it would have been like \nJones\u2019 \u2013 indeed that Jones2 might have had a psychic life 100% like \nJones\u2019 \u2013 makes perfect sense, but that he might have been to that\ndegree, the same psyche \u2013 that Jones \u201885% existed\u2019\n \u2013 arguably makes no sense. Take the case in which Jones and Jones2\nhave exactly similar lives throughout: which 85% of the 100%\nsimilar mental events do they share? Nor does it make sense to suggest\nthat Jones might have participated in the whole of Jones2\u2019s psychic\nlife, but in a rather ghostly only 85% there manner. Clearly,\nthe notion of overlap of numerically identical psychic parts cannot be\napplied in the way that overlap of actual bodily part constitution\nquite unproblematically can.\n\n\nThis might make one try the second answer. We can apply the\n\u2018overlap\u2019 answer to the Jones body, but the question of\nwhether the minds or subjects would have been the same, has no clear\nsense. It is difficult to see why it does not. Suppose Jones found out\nthat he had originally been one of twins, in the sense that the zygote\nfrom which he developed had divided, but that the other half had died\nsoon afterwards. He can entertain the thought that if it had been his\nhalf that had died, he would never have existed as a conscious being,\nthough someone would whose life, both inner and outer, might have been\nvery similar to his. He might feel rather guiltily grateful that it was\nthe other half that died. It would be strange to think that Jones is\nwrong to think that there is a matter of fact about this. And how is\none to \u2018manage\u2019 the transition from the case where there is\na matter of fact to the case where there is not?\n\n\nIf the reasoning above is correct, one is left with only the first\noption. If so, there has to be an absolute matter of fact from the\nsubjective point of view. But the physical examples we have considered\nshow that when something is essentially complex, this cannot be the\ncase. When there is constitution, degree and overlap of constitution\nare inevitably possible. So the mind must be simple, and this is\npossible only if it is something like a Cartesian substance.\n4.6 The Aristotelian Argument in a Modern Form\n\n\nPutting his anti-materialist argument outlined above, in section 1,\nin very general terms, Aristotle\u2019s worry was that a material organ\ncould not have the range and flexibility that are required for human\nthought. His worries concerned the cramping effect that matter would\nhave on the range of objects that intellect could accommodate.\nParallel modern concerns centre on the restriction that matter would\nimpose on the range of rational processes that we could\nexhibit. Some of these concerns are of a technical kind. G\u00f6del, for example, believed that his famous theorem showed that there are demonstrably rational forms of mathematical thought of which humans are capable which could not be exhibited by a mechanical\nor formal system of a sort that a physical mind would have to be. Penrose (1990) has argued that Turing\u2019s halting problem has similar consequences.But there are other less technical and easier to appreciate issues. I will mention four ways in which physicalist theories of thought seem vulnerable to attack by the dualist\n\n\n(a) At least since the time of Ryle\u2019s Concept of Mind (1949), it has been assumed that thinking can be handled in a dispositionalist way; so only sensations or \u2018raw feels\u2019 constitute a problem for the physicalist. There has been a rise or revival of a belief in what is now called cognitive phenomenology, that is, the belief that thoughts, of whatever kind \u2013 beliefs, desires, and the whole range of propositional attitude state \u2013 are conscious in a more than behavioural functional sense. This raises problems for physicalism, for, just as it is a problem that direct knowledge of \u2018what it is like\u2019 to experience your sensations is ultimately hidden from anyone else, so what you are thinking is directly accessible only privately, once it has been conceded that it has a phenomenology and not just a functional manifestation.\n\n\n(b) Anything purely physical operates solely according to physical laws operating on its physical properties: it does not, at bottom, operate according to meanings, senses, or propositional content. As a \u2018thinking machine\u2019, it is what Dennett (1987: 61) calls \u2018a syntactic engine\u2019, where \u2018syntax\u2019 is used, somewhat extendedly, to signify merely the physical structure of symbols and the consequent rules of their operation, rather than their meaning. The issue is whether, under this constraint, one can give an account for meaningful communication and understanding at all.\n\n\n(c) Physicalist theories of thought almost all focus on the model of\ncomputing, and when it comes to making problem solving (as opposed to\nsimply calculating) computers, computation comes across what is known\nas the Frame Problem. This is clearly expounded in Dennett\n(1984); see also the entry on\n the frame problem. \nThe problem is that the \u2018mechanical mind\u2019 can\nonly follow instructions, cannot see relevance that has not been\nstrictly encoded.This is often expressed by saying it lacks\n\u2018common sense\u2019.\n\n\n(d) There is what has become known as \u2018Benacerraf\u2019s Problem\u2019 (See his\n1983). Numbers, it would seem, are abstract objects, yet our\nintellects operate with them all the time. How does a physical brain\ninteract with an abstract entity? A similar problem could be raised\nfor concepts in general; they are abstract, general entities, not\nphysical particulars, yet they are the meat and drink of thinking. For\na dualist about intellect there does not appear to be the same\nproblem. The immaterial intellect is precisely the sort of thing that\ncan grasp abstract objects, such as numbers and universals \u2013 in the\nAristotelian context, the immaterial intellect is the home of\nforms. (There is still the issue of how this intellectual capacity of\nthe immaterial mind relates to sensory consciousness. According to\nAristotle, perception is a wholly embodied process, but for modern\ndualists, sensory consciousness is not material. In order to unify the\nperceptual and intellectual functions of the mind, traditional\nempiricists tended to be imagists, in their theory of thought, in\norder to assimilate the intellectual to the sensory, but this\nassimilation is rejected by those who believe in a distinct cognitive\nphenomenology, as mentioned in (a) above. The issue of how these two\nfunctions of mind are related in dualism is, it seems to me,\ninsufficiently investigated.)  The difficulty in accounting for the\nbrain\u2019s relation to abstract entities explains why most materialists\ntend to be nominalists,thus reducing thoughts to concrete particulars\nof some kind. (D. M. Armstrong in his (1978) is a striking exception\nto this, accepting an in re theory of universals.) But if you\ndo not find either nominalism or Armstrong\u2019s causal-functional theory\nof thinking convincing, Plato\u2019s idea in the Phaedo that the\nintellect must be such that it can have an affinity with immaterial\nthings begins to look very plausible.\n\n\n\nI will not discuss (a) further, as it is discussed in \nsection 5 of the \nentry on \n  phenomenal intentionality, \nAn immaterialist response to (d) can be found in Robinson (2011).\n\n\nBoth (b) and (c) seem to draw out the claim that a material system\n lacks understanding. John Searle\u2019s famous \u2018Chinese\n Room\u2019 argument (Searle 1980; see also the entry on\n  Chinese room argument) \nseems to support this conclusion, at least if the material system\ntakes the form of a classical computer, manipulating symbols according\nto rules. Searle imagines himself in a room with a letter box through\nwhich strings of symbols are posted in, and, following a book of\nrules, he puts out symbols which the rules dictate, given the strings\nhe is receiving. In fact, Searle says, he has been conducting a\nconversation in Chinese, because the symbols are Chinese script, and\nthe rules those on which a Chinese computer might work, but he has not\nunderstood a word. Therefore neither does a computer understand, so\nwe, understanding creatures, are not computers. If Searle is right,\nthis is the end for the classical \u2018syntactic engine\u2019 as a\nmodel for thought.\n\n\nA blow was struck against the computational theory of thought when, in\n2000, Fodor produced his The Mind Does Not Work That Way, in\nwhich he made clear his belief that the kind of computationalism that\nhe had been describing and developing ever since the 1970s only fits\nsub-personal informational processing, not conscious, problem solving\nthought. I say that he \u2018made this clear\u2019, because he had\nalways mentioned this reservation, but his claim that what he was\ndescribing was \u2018the Language of Thought\u2019 led his readers\ngenerally to take him to be proposing an account of what we normally\nconsider to be thinking, which is not restricted (even if it includes\nat all) sub-personal processes. The modest view it is entirely in line\nwith his close colleague Chomsky\u2019s claim that his\n\u2013 Chomsky\u2019s \u2013 linguistic theories cannot touch the \u2018creative\nuse of language\u2019(See Baker, 2011).\n\n\nOne physicalist response to these challenges is to say that they apply\nonly to the classical computing model, and are avoided by\nconnectionist theories. Classical computing works on rules of\ninference like those of standard logic, but connectionism is rather a\nform of associationism, which is supposedly closer to the way in which\nthe brain works.(See the entry on Connectionism.) The latest version\nof this \u2013 \u2018Deep Learning\u2019 \u2013 is very good at\nface recognition and, in general, pattern recognition, including those\ninvolved in the playing of games like chess and Go. But Gary Marcus\n(2018 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources) and others have pointed\nout the ways in which these impressive machines are quite different\nfrom human thought. Marcus points to ten significant differences, but\nthe two most easy to capture briefly are (i) \u2018deep\nlearning\u2019 is data hungry. We can learn things with very few\ntrials because we latch on to abstract relationships, whereas the\nmachine requires many \u2013 perhaps thousands or millions \u2013 of\nexamples to try to catch extensionally what we get by the abstract or\nintensional relation. (ii) Deep learning is shallow and has a limited\ncapacity for transfer of what it has learnt from one context to\nanother, even though the differences look trivial to us.  It seems\nthat collecting examples cannot itself constitute \u2018getting the\npoint\u2019, though it might manage to mimic it, if the circumstances\nare carefully managed.\n\n\nThe dualist might sum up the situation on thought in the following way. The case against physicalist theories of sensation is that it is unbelievable that what it feels like to be struck hard on the nose is itself either just a case of being disposed or caused to engage in certain behaviours, or that what it feels like is not fundamental to the way you do react. Similarly, the dualist about thought will say, when you are, for example, engaged in a philosophical discussion, and you make a response to your interlocutor, it is obvious that you are intending to respond to what you thought he or she meant and are concentrating on what what you intend to say means. It seems as bizarre to say that this is a bye-product of processes to which meaning is irrelevant, as it is to claim the same about sensory consciousness. You are, in other words, as fundamentally a semantically driven engine, as you are a sensorily consciously driven one. Perhaps, in the case of a sophisticated conversation, the fundamentality of meaning, and of conscious reflection, as a driver is even more obvious than in the case of sensation\n\n\nA dualist could, it seems, argue that Plato was right in claiming that intellect necessarily has an affinity with the realm of abstract entities, and Aristotle was right to think that no material or mechanical system could capture the flexibility built into genuine understanding. We all have our limitations, but there is no specific point, following directly from what we are made of, or how we are \u2018programmed\u2019 which constitutes an absolute barrier.\n5. Problems for Dualism\n\n\nWe have already discussed the problem of interaction. In this\nsection we shall consider two other facets of dualism that worry\ncritics. First, there is what one might term the queerness of\nthe mental if conceived of as non-physical. Second there is the\ndifficulty of giving an account of the unity of the mind. We shall\nconsider this latter as it faces both the bundle theorist and the\nsubstance dualist.\n5.1 The Queerness of the Mental\n\n\nMental states are characterised by two main properties,\nsubjectivity, otherwise known as privileged access, and intentionality.\nPhysical objects and their properties are sometimes observable and\nsometimes not, but any physical object is equally accessible, in\nprinciple, to anyone. From the right location, we could all see the\ntree in the quad, and, though none of us can observe an electron\ndirectly, everyone is equally capable of detecting it in the same ways\nusing instruments. But the possessor of mental states has a privileged\naccess to them that no-one else can share. That is why there is a\nsceptical \u2018problem of other minds\u2019, but no corresponding\n\u2018problem of my own mind\u2019. This suggests to some\nphilosophers that minds are not ordinary occupants of physical\nspace.\n\n\nPhysical objects are spatio-temporal, and bear spatio-temporal and\ncausal relations to each other. Mental states seem to have causal\npowers, but they also possess the mysterious property of \nintentionality \u2013 being about other things \u2013 including things \nlike Zeus and the square root of minus one, which do not exist. No mere\nphysical thing could be said to be, in a literal sense,\n\u2018about\u2019 something else. The nature of the mental is both\nqueer and elusive. In Ryle\u2019s deliberately abusive phrase, the mind, as\nthe dualist conceives of it, is a \u2018ghost in a machine\u2019.\nGhosts are mysterious and unintelligible: machines are composed of\nidentifiable parts and work on intelligible principles. But this\ncontrast holds only if we stick to a Newtonian and common-sense view of\nthe material. Think instead of energy and force-fields in a space-time\nthat possesses none of the properties that our senses seem to reveal:\non this conception, we seem to be able to attribute to matter nothing\nbeyond an abstruse mathematical structure. Whilst the material world,\nbecause of its mathematicalisation, forms a tighter abstract system\nthan mind, the sensible properties that figure as the objects of mental\nstates constitute the only intelligible content for any concrete\npicture of the world that we can devise. Perhaps the world within the\nexperiencing mind is, once one considers it properly, no \nmore \u2013 or even less \u2013 queer than the world outside it.\n5.2 The Unity of the Mind\n\n\nWhether one believes that the mind is a substance or just a bundle\nof properties, the same challenge arises, which is to explain the\nnature of the unity of the immaterial mind. For the Cartesian, that\nmeans explaining how he understands the notion of immaterial substance.\nFor the Humean, the issue is to explain the nature of the relationship\nbetween the different elements in the bundle that binds them into one\nthing. Neither tradition has been notably successful in this latter\ntask: indeed, Hume, in the appendix to the Treatise, declared\nhimself wholly mystified by the problem, rejecting his own initial\nsolution (though quite why is not clear from the text).\n5.2.1 Unity and Bundle Dualism\n\n\nIf the mind is only a bundle of properties, without a mental\nsubstance to unite them, then an account is needed of what constitutes\nits unity. The only route appears to be to postulate a primitive\nrelation of co-consciousness in which the various elements stand to\neach other.\n\n\nThere are two strategies which can be used to attack the bundle\ntheory. One is to claim that our intuitions favour belief in a subject\nand that the arguments presented in favour of the bundle alternative\nare unsuccessful, so the intuition stands. The other is to try to\nrefute the theory itself. Foster (1991, 212\u20139) takes the former path.\nThis is not effective against someone who thinks that metaphysical\neconomy gives a prima facie priority to bundle theories, on account of\ntheir avoiding mysterious substances.\n\n\nThe core objection to bundle theories (see, for example, Armstrong\n(1968), 21\u20133) is that, because it takes individual mental contents as\nits elements, such contents should be able to exist alone, as could the\nindividual bricks from a house. Hume accepted this consequence, but\nmost philosophers regard it as absurd. There could not be a mind that\nconsisted of a lone pain or red after-image, especially not of one that\nhad detached itself from the mind to which it had previously belonged.\nTherefore it makes more sense to think of mental contents as modes\nof a subject.\n\n\nBundle theorists tend to take phenomenal contents as the primary\nelements in their bundle. Thus the problem is how to relate, say, the\nvisual field to the auditory field, producing a \u2018unity of\napperception\u2019, that is, a total experience that seems to be\npresented to a single subject. Seeing the problem in this way has\nobvious Humean roots. This atomistic conception of the problem becomes\nless natural if one tries to accommodate other kinds of mental activity\nand contents. How are acts of conceptualising, attending to or willing\nwith respect to, such perceptual contents to be conceived? These kinds\nof mental acts seem to be less naturally treated as atomic elements in\na bundle, bound by a passive unity of apperception. William James\n(1890, vol. 1, 336\u201341) attempts to answer these problems. He claims to\nintrospect in himself a \u2018pulse of thought\u2019 for each present\nmoment, which he calls \u2018the Thought\u2019 and which is the\n\u2018vehicle of the judgement of identity\u2019 and the\n\u2018vehicle of choice as well as of cognition\u2019. These\n\u2018pulses\u2019 are united over time because each\n\u2018appropriates\u2019 the past Thoughts and \u2018makes us say\n\u201cas sure as I exist, those past facts were part of myself\u201d.\nJames attributes to these Thoughts acts of judging, attending, willing\netc, and this may seem incoherent in the absence of a genuine subject.\nBut there is also a tendency to treat many if not all aspects of agency\nas mere awareness of bodily actions or tendencies, which moves one back\ntowards a more normal Humean position. Whether James\u2019 position really\nimproves on Hume\u2019s, or merely mystifies it, is still a moot point. (But\nsee Sprigge (1993), 84\u201397, for an excellent, sympathetic\ndiscussion.)\n5.2.2 Unity and Substance Dualism\n\n\nThe problem is to explain what kind of a thing an immaterial\nsubstance is, such that its presence explains the unity of the mind.\nThe answers given can be divided into three kinds.\n\n\n(a) The \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 account: The view that immaterial\nsubstance is a kind of immaterial stuff. There are two problems with\nthis approach. First, in so far as this \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 has any\ncharacterisation as a \u2018stuff\u2019 \u2013 that is, a structure\nof its own over and above the explicitly mental properties that it\nsustains \u2013 it leaves it as much a mystery why this kind\nof stuff should support consciousness as it is why ordinary matter\nshould. Second, and connectedly, it is not clear in what sense such\nstuff is immaterial, except in the sense that it cannot be integrated\ninto the normal scientific account of the physical world. Why is it not\njust an aberrant kind of physical stuff?\n\n\n(b) The \u2018consciousness\u2019 account: The view that consciousness is the\nsubstance. Account (a) allowed the immaterial substance to have a\nnature over and above the kinds of state we would regard as mental. The\nconsciousness account does not. This is Descartes\u2019 view. The most\nobvious objection to this theory is that it does not allow the subject\nto exist when unconscious. This forces one to take one of four possible\ntheories. One could claim (i) that we are conscious when we do not seem\nto be (which was Descartes\u2019 view): or (ii) that we exist\nintermittently, though are still the same thing (which is Swinburne\u2019s\ntheory, (1997), 179): or (iii) that each of us consists of a series of\nsubstances, changed at any break in consciousness, which pushes one\ntowards a constructivist account of identity through time and so\ntowards the spirit of the bundle theory: or (iv) even more\nspeculatively, that the self stands in such a relation to the normal\ntime series that its own continued existence is not brought into\nquestion by its failure to be present in time at those moments when it\nis not conscious within that series (Robinson, forthcoming).\n\n\n(c) The \u2018no-analysis\u2019 account: The view that it is a mistake to\npresent any analysis. This is Foster\u2019s view, though I think Vendler\n(1984) and Madell (1981) have similar positions. Foster argues that\neven the \u2018consciousness\u2019 account is an attempt to explain\nwhat the immaterial self is \u2018made of\u2019 which assimilates it\ntoo far towards a kind of physical substance. In other words, Descartes\nhas only half escaped from the \u2018ectoplasmic\u2019 model. (He\nhas half escaped because he does not attribute non-mental\nproperties to the self, but he is still captured by trying to explain\nwhat it is made of.)\n\n\nFoster (1991) expresses it as follows:\n\u2026it seems to me that when I focus on myself\nintrospectively, I am not only aware of being in a certain mental\ncondition; I am also aware, with the same kind of immediacy, of being a\ncertain sort of thing\u2026 \n\n\n\nIt will now be asked: \u2018Well, what is this nature,\nthis sortal attribute? Let\u2019s have it specified!\u2019 But such a\ndemand is misconceived. Of course, I can give it a verbal label: for\ninstance, I can call it \u2018subjectness\u2019 or\n\u2018selfhood\u2019. But unless they are interpreted\n\u2018ostensively\u2019, by reference to what is revealed by\nintrospective awareness, such labels will not convey anything over and\nabove the nominal essence of the term \u2018basic subject\u2019. In\nthis respect, however, there is no difference between this attribute,\nwhich constitutes the subject\u2019s essential nature, and the specific\npsychological attributes of his conscious life\u2026\n\n\nAdmittedly, the feeling that there must be more to be said from a\nGod\u2019s eye view dies hard. The reason is that, even when we have\nacknowledged that basic subjects are wholly non-physical, we still tend\nto approach the issue of their essential natures in the shadow of the\nphysical paradigm. (243\u20135)\n\n\n\nBerkeley\u2019s concept of notion again helps here. One can\ninterpret Berkeley as implying that there is more to the self than\nintrospection can capture, or we can interpret him as saying that\nnotions, though presenting stranger entities than ideas,\ncapture them just as totally. The latter is the \u2018no account is\nneeded\u2019 view.",
