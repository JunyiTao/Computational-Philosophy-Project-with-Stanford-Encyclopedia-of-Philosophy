    "main_text": "Friendship, Politics, and Environmentalism\n5. Locating Thoreau\n\nThoreau has somewhat misleadingly been classified as a New England\ntranscendentalist, and\u2014even though he never rejected this\nlabel\u2014it does not fit in many ways. Some of his major\ndifferences from Emerson have already been discussed, and further\ndifferences appear when Thoreau is compared to such figures as Orestes\nBrownson, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson Alcott. A history of\ntranscendentalism in New England which appeared in the late nineteenth\ncentury mentions Thoreau only once, in passing (Frothingham 1886,\n133). And a more recent history of the movement concludes that Thoreau\nhad little in common with this group of thinkers, who were for the\nmost part committed to some version of Christianity, to a dualistic\nunderstanding of mind and matter, and to the related idea that sense\nexperience is unreliable (Boller 1974, 29\u201335 & 176). A\ncrucial step in Thoreau\u2019s intellectual development occurred when\nhe \u201cdisassociated himself from Emerson\u2019s Transcendentalist\nview of nature as symbol\u201d (Slicer 2013, 181), as one scholar\nnotes. It was suggested above that a better way of situating Thoreau\nwithin the Western philosophical tradition is to consider him a kind\nof transcendental idealist, in the spirit of Kant. For reasons that\nought to be obvious by now, he should be of interest to students of\nKant, Fichte, and Schelling\u2014all of whom he studied at first or\nsecond hand\u2014as well as Schopenhauer. Thoreau was a capable and\nenthusiastic classicist, whose study of ancient Greek and Roman\nauthors convinced him that philosophy ought to be a lived discipline:\nfor this reason, he can profitably be grouped with other\nnineteenth-century thinkers, such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, who\nwere critics of philosophy in the early modern period. Yet he also has\nthe distinction of being among the first Western philosophers to be\nsignificantly influenced by ancient Chinese and Indian thought. He\nanticipates Bergson and Merleau-Ponty in his attention to the dynamics\nof the embodied mind, and shares with Peirce and James a concern for\nproblems of knowledge as they arise within practical experience.\n\nContemporary philosophers are increasingly discovering how much\nThoreau has to teach\u2014especially, in the areas of knowledge and\nperception, and in ethical debates about the value of land and life.\nHis affinities with the pragmatic and phenomenological traditions, and\nthe enormous resources he offers for environmental philosophy, have\nalso started to receive more attention (see, e.g., Balthrop-Lewis,\n2019)\u2014and Walden itself continues to be encountered by\nreaders as a remarkable provocation to philosophical thought. Still,\nit remains true that the political aspect of Thoreau\u2019s\nphilosophy has come closer to receiving its due than any of these\nothers: whether or not this is because such prominent figures as\nGandhi and King cited Thoreau as an inspiration, it has resulted in a\ndisproportionate focus on what is only one part of an integral\nphilosophy, a part that can hardly be understood in isolation from the\nothers. Even if it is a sign of Thoreau\u2019s peculiar greatness\nthat subsequent American philosophy has not known what to make of him,\nit is a shame if his exclusion from the mainstream philosophical canon\nhas kept his voice from being heard by some of those who might be in a\nposition to appreciate it. Then again, as Thoreau himself notes, it is\nnever too late to give up our prejudices. Others have observed (see\nSlicer 2013, 182\u2013183) that, based on the amount of prominent\nwork on Thoreau as a philosopher which has recently appeared, his\nprofile seems to be ever so gradually rising on the American\nphilosophical landscape.\n",
