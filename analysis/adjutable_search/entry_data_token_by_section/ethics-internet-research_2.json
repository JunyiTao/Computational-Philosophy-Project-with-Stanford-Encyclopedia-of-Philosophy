History and Development of IRE as a Discipline\n\nAn extensive body of literature has developed since the 1990s around\nthe use of the Internet for research (S. Jones 1999; Hunsinger,\nKlastrup, & Allen (eds.) 2010; Consalvo & Ess (eds.) 2011;\nZimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda (eds.) 2017), with a growing emphasis on\nthe ethical dimensions of Internet research.\n\nA flurry of Internet research, and explicit concern for the ethical\nissues concurrently at play in it, began in the mid-1990s. In 1996,\nStorm King recognized the growing use of the Internet as a venue for\nresearch. His work explored the American Psychological\nAssociation\u2019s guidelines for human subjects research with\nemergent forms of email, chat, listservs, and virtual communities.\nWith careful attention to risk and benefit to Internet subjects, King\noffered a cautionary note:\n\n\nWhen a field of study is new, the fine points of ethical\nconsiderations involved are undefined. As the field matures and\nresults are compiled, researchers often review earlier studies and\nbecome concerned because of the apparent disregard for the human\nsubjects involved (1996: 119).\n\n\nThe 1996 issue of Information Society dedicated to Internet\nresearch is considered a watershed moment, and included much seminal\nresearch still of impact and relevance today (Allen 1996; Boehlefeld\n1996; Reid 1996).\n\nSherry Turkle\u2019s 1997 Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age\nof the Internet called direct attention to the human element of\nonline game environments. Moving squarely towards person-based versus\ntext-based research, Turkle pushed researchers to consider human\nsubjects implications of Internet research. Similarly, Markham\u2019s\nLife Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space\n(1998) highlighted the methodological complexities of online\nethnographic studies, as did Jacobson\u2019s 1999 methodological\ntreatment of Internet research. The \u201cfield\u201d of study\nchanged the dynamics of researcher-researched roles, identity, and\nrepresentation of participants from virtual spaces. Markham\u2019s\nwork in qualitative online research has been influential across\ndisciplines, as research in nursing, psychology, and medicine has\nfound the potential of this paradigm for online research (Flicker et\nal. 2004; Eysenbach & Till 2001; Seaboldt & Kupier 1997; Sharf\n1997).\n\nThen, in 1999, the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS), with a contract from the U.S. Office for Protection from\nResearch Risks (now known as the Office for Human Research\nProtections), convened a workshop, with the goal of assessing the\nalignment of traditional research ethics concepts to Internet\nresearch. The workshop acknowledged\n\n\nThe vast amount of social and behavioral information potentially\navailable on the Internet has made it a prime target for researchers\nwishing to study the dynamics of human interactions and their\nconsequences in this virtual medium. Researchers can potentially\ncollect data from widely dispersed population sat relatively low cost\nand in less time than similar efforts in the physical world. As a\nresult, there has been an increase in the number of Internet studies,\nranging from surveys to naturalistic observation (Frankel & Siang\n1999: 1).\n\n\nIn the medical/biomedical contexts, Internet research has grown\nrapidly. Also in 1999, Gunther Eysenbach wrote the first editorial to\nthe newly formed Journal of Medical Internet Research. There\nwere three driving forces behind the inception of this journal, and\nEysenbach called attention to the growing social and interpersonal\naspects of the Internet:\n\n\nFirst, Internet protocols are used for clinical information and\ncommunication. In the future, Internet technology will be the platform\nfor many telemedical applications. Second, the Internet revolutionizes\nthe gathering, access and dissemination of non-clinical information in\nmedicine: Bibliographic and factual databases are now world-wide\naccessible via graphical user interfaces, epidemiological and public\nhealth information can be gathered using the Internet, and\nincreasingly the Internet is used for interactive medical education\napplications. Third, the Internet plays an important role for consumer\nhealth education, health promotion and teleprevention. (As an aside,\nit should be emphasized that \u201chealth education\u201d on the\nInternet goes beyond the traditional model of health education, where\na medical professional teaches the patient: On the Internet, much\n\u201chealth education\u201d is done\n\u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d by means of patient self support\ngroups organizing in cyberspace. These patient-to-patient interchanges\nare becoming an important part of healthcare and are redefining the\ntraditional model of preventive medicine and health promotion).\n\n\nWith scholarly attention growing and with the 1999 AAAS report\n(Frankel & Siang 1999) calling for action, other professional\nassociations took notice and began drafting statements or guidelines,\nor addendum to their extant professional standards. For example, The\nBoard of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological\nAssociation established an Advisory Group on Conducting Research on\nthe Internet in 2001; the American Counseling Association\u2019s 2005\nrevision to its Code of Ethics; the Association of Internet\nResearchers (AoIR) Ethics Working Group Guidelines, the National\nCommittee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the\nHumanities (NESH Norway), among others, have directed researchers and\nreview boards to the ethics of Internet research, with attention to\nthe most common areas of ethical concern (see\n OIR\n for links).\n\nWhile many researchers focus on traditional research ethics\nprinciples, conceptualizations of Internet research ethics depend on\ndisciplinary perspectives. Some disciplines, notably from the arts and\nhumanities, posit that Internet research is more about context and\nrepresentation than about \u201chuman subjects\u201d, suggesting\nthere is no intent, and thus minimal or no harm, to engage in research\nabout actual persons. The debate has continued since the early 2000s.\nWhite (2002) argued against extant regulations that favored or\nprivileged specific ideological, disciplinary and cultural\nprerogatives, which limit the freedoms and creativity of arts and\nhumanities research. For example, she notes that the AAAS report\n\u201cconfuses physical individuals with constructed materials and\nhuman subjects with composite cultural works\u201d, again calling\nattention to the person versus text divide that has permeated Internet\nresearch ethics debates. Another example of disciplinary differences\ncomes from the Oral History Association, which acknowledged the\ngrowing use of the Internet as a site for research:\n\n\nSimply put, oral history collects memories and personal commentaries\nof historical significance through recorded interviews. An oral\nhistory interview generally consists of a well-prepared interviewer\nquestioning an interviewee and recording their exchange in audio or\nvideo format. Recordings of the interview are transcribed, summarized,\nor indexed and then placed in a library or archives. These interviews\nmay be used for research or excerpted in a publication, radio or video\ndocumentary, museum exhibition, dramatization or other form of public\npresentation. Recordings, transcripts, catalogs, photographs and\nrelated documentary materials can also be posted on the Internet\n(Ritchie 2003: 19).\n\n\nWhile the American Historical Association (A. Jones 2008) has argued\nthat such research be \u201cexplicitly exempted\u201d from ethical\nreview board oversight, the use of the Internet could complicate such\na stance if such data became available in public settings or available\n\u201cdownstream\u201d with potential, unforeseeable risks to\nreputation, economic standing, or psychological harm, should\nidentification occur.\n\nUnder the concept of text rather than human subjects, Internet\nresearch rests on arguments of publication and copyright; consider the\nvenue of a blog, which does not meet the definition of human subject\nas in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.102f (2009), as interpreted by most ethical\nreview boards. A researcher need not obtain consent to use text from a\nblog, as it is generally considered publicly available, textual,\npublished material. This argument of the \u201cpublic park\u201d\nanalogy that has been generally accepted by researchers is appropriate\nfor some Internet venues and tools, but not all: Context, intent,\nsensitivity of data, and expectations of Internet participants were\nidentified in 2004 by Sveninngsson as crucial markers in Internet\nresearch ethics considerations.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, with three major anthologies published, and a\ngrowing literature base, there was ample scholarly literature\ndocumenting IRE across disciplines and methodologies, and\nsubsequently, there was anecdotal data emerging from the review boards\nevaluating such research. In search of empirical data regarding the\nactual review board processes of Internet research from a human\nsubjects perspective, Buchanan and Ess surveyed over 700 United States\nethics review boards, and found that boards were primarily concerned\nwith privacy, data security and confidentiality, and ensuring\nappropriate informed consent and recruitment procedures (Buchanan\n& Ess 2009; Buchanan & Hvizdak 2009).\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian Tri-Council\u2019s Social Sciences and\nHumanities Research Ethics Special Working Committee: A Working\nCommittee of the Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics was\nconvened (Blackstone et al. 2008); and in 2010, a meeting at the\nSecretary\u2019s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections highlighted Internet research (SACHRP 2010). Such\nprominent professional organizations as the Public Responsibility in\nMedicine and Research (PRIM&R) and the American Educational\nResearch Association (AERA) have begun featuring Internet research\nethics regularly at their conferences and related publications.\n\nRecently, disciplines not traditionally involved in human subjects\nresearch have begun their own explorations of IRE. For example,\nresearchers in computer security have actively examined the tenets of\nresearch ethics in CS and ICT (Aycock et al. 2012; Dittrich, Bailey,\n& Dietrich 2011; Carpenter & Dittrich 2012; Buchanan et al.\n2011). Notably, the U.S. Federal Register requested comments on\n\u201cThe Menlo Report\u201d in December 2011, which calls for a\ncommitment by computer science researchers to the three principles of\nrespect for persons, beneficence, and justice, while also adding a\nfourth principle on respect for law and public interest (Homeland\nSecurity 2011). SIGCHI, an international society for professionals,\nacademics, and students interested in human-technology and\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI), has increasingly focused on how IRE\napplies to work in their domain (Frauenberger et al. 2017; Fiesler et\nal. 2018).\n",
