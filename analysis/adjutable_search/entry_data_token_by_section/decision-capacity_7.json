    "main_text": "Elements of Capacity || Appreciation\n4.3 Appreciation\n\nIn addition to understanding in the basic factual sense alluded to\nabove, most writers on capacity agree that subjects must also have\nsome appreciation of the nature and significance of the decision that\nthey are faced with (Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 42\u201352). The\nfacts, and the implications of those facts for the subject\u2019s\nlife, must mean something to the subject. The most minimal\nway of interpreting this requirement is to see it as requiring that\nthe subject not only grasp information but genuinely\nbelieve that it truly applies to him. The appreciation\nelement of capacity is sometimes held to derive from the legal\nrequirement that each subject must have \u201cinsight\u201d into the\ncircumstances of a given decision (Glass 1997).\n\nMany theorists stop at this minimal interpretation, but even this\nrequirement is significant, for it rules out certain kinds of patients\nwho are delusional, who can grasp what their doctor is saying to them,\nbut refuse to believe that anything their doctor says is true (Grisso\n& Appelbaum 1998: 42\u201343). In addition, in order to apply\nthis requirement, clinicians must be able to distinguish between cases\nwhere patients refuse to believe doctors for doctrinal or cultural\nreasons\u2014for example a Christian Scientist who believes that\ndespite what her doctor says only prayer can heal\u2014and cases\nwhere failure of appreciation results from losing touch with reality\n(Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 45\u201349). For example, imagine a\ncase in which an elderly demented woman clearly grasps the fact\nthat her surgeons wish to amputate her feet because her feet are\ngangrenous and they believe that she is in real danger of dying if\nthey do not amputate. But despite being able to state these facts back\nto her doctors, the woman, who seems confused and disoriented, says\nthings that reveal she does not really believe there is anything\nseriously wrong with her feet. For example, she talks about what she\nwill do once her feet are all healed. She may fail appreciation and so\nmay not be deemed competent to refuse the treatment (based on a case\ndescribed in Abernathy 1984).\n\nMore robustly, appreciation may be understood as going beyond just\nacceptance of, or belief in, the facts. Some theorists argue further\nthat appreciation involves being able to \n\n\nappreciate the nature and meaning of potential alternatives\u2014what\nit would be like and \u201cfeel\u201d like to be in possible future\nstates and to undergo various experiences\u2014and to integrate this\nappreciation into one\u2019s decision-making. (Buchanan & Brock\n1989: 24) \n\n\nHowever, there are no easy ways to determine when this deeper kind of\nappreciation is present. Moreover, contemporary psychology has shown\nus just how infrequent such appreciation of future scenarios is among\nmost people. Appreciating what a future option will feel like requires\nwhat psychologists call \u201caffective forecasting\u201d, and\nnumerous studies have shown that we are, most of us anyway, very poor\naffective forecasters (Ubel, Loewenstein, Hershey, et al. 2001;\nWilson, Wheatley, Meyers, et al. 2000; Gilbert, Gill & Wilson 2002; Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, et al. 1998; Wilson, Meyers & Gilbert 2001; Wilson & Gilbert 2005; Ubel,\nLoewenstein, Schwarz, et. al 2005; Ubel, Loewenstein, &\nJepson 2005; on the relevance of this to capacity see Halpern &\nArnold 2008). But given this, if we were to require such deep\nappreciation we would again risk ruling too many people incompetent\n(see inclusivity\n \u00a75.1).\n",
