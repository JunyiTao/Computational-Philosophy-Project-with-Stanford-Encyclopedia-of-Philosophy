    "main_text": "Philosophical Controversies\n6. Philosophical Controversies\n\nThe development of hermeneutics since Gadamer forwarded his\n\u2018philosophical hermeneutics\u2019 in Truth and Method\nhas been fostered by philosophical controversies about the\nconsequences of his project. The most significant of these\ncontroversies are about the consequences of philosophical hermeneutics\nin relation to critical theory and to\n deconstruction.[9]\n Although philosophical interest in these controversies is extensive,\nin each case, discussion arises in close connection with Gadamer\nhimself. In the case of the controversy in relation to critical\ntheory, discussion originates between J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Gadamer\nover the problem of critique, or, more specifically, the critique of\nideology. In the case of the controversy in relation to\ndeconstruction, discussion originates between Jacques Derrida and\nGadamer. While this discussion is itself layered and gives rise to new\nquestions over time, it concerns, in part, the question of whether the\nsuccess of understanding genuinely achieves a determination of\nmeaning.\n\nGadamer\u2019s engagements with Habermas and Derrida themselves are\nsometimes hailed as examples, or perhaps case studies, of his own\nconception of hermeneutical conversation. Gadamer has claimed that\nsuch conversation proceeds always from \u201crecognizing in advance\nthe possibility that your partner is right, even recognizing the\npossible superiority of your partner\u201d (Gadamer,\n\u201cReflections on My Philosophical Journey,\u201d 36). Gadamer\nfamously puts this belief into practice in his discussions with both\nHabermas and Derrida, and the legacy of these debates plays an\nimportant role in Gadamer\u2019s subsequent thinking.\n",
