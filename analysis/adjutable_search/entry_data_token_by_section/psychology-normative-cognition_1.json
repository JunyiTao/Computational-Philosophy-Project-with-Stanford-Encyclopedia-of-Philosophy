    "main_text": "A Psychological Capacity Dedicated to Norms || Background: Evolution and Ultimate Considerations\n1.1 Background: Evolution and Ultimate Considerations\n\nA working hypothesis of cognitive-evolutionary approaches is that the\npsychological mechanisms underlying norm cognition are evolved\nadaptations to important selection pressures in human evolutionary\nhistory (Richerson & Boyd 2005; Sripada & Stich 2007,\nTomasello 2009; Chudek & Henrich 2011; Kelly & Davis 2018, cf.\nCosmides & Tooby 1992). Even if a detailed proximate account were\nalready available, other questions could be asked about the provenance\nof the norm system: how\u2014that is, due to which evolutionary\nfactors\u2014did human minds come to be equipped with these\npsychological mechanisms? To what adaptive problem or problems was\nnormative cognition a solution? What selection pressures were\nprimarily responsible for the evolution of a norm system, and what\nphylogenetic trajectory did that evolution take? A brief summary of\nthe types of answers currently on offer to these questions provides\nuseful context for the discussion of proximate explanations that\nfollows.\n\nA fairly uncontroversial background tenet of the received view is that\nhumans are extraordinarily social animals, and that our hypertrophied\nabilities to learn from and cooperate with each other are key to what\nset us apart from our closest primate ancestors and other hominid\nspecies. A crucial difference is thought to be that human capacities\nto imitate and learn from each other became powerful enough to sustain\ncumulative culture (Tomasello 1999; J. Henrich &\nMcElreath 2003, Laland 2017). Culture is understood as information\nthat is transmitted between individuals and groups via behavior,\nrather than processes like genetic transmission (Ramsey 2013).\nBeliefs, preferences, norms, skills, techniques,\ninformation-containing artifacts, etc., are passed from individual to\nindividual, and thus across populations and between generations,\nmainly by social learning (Mathew & Perreault 2015). For\nexample, development of the set of techniques and skills associated\nwith throwing spears, or the knowledge and tools enabling the\ncontrolled use of fire, have been tied to increases in opportunities\nfor social learning provided by expanding social networks and more\ncomplex forms of social activity (Thieme 1997; Gowlett 2006). Culture\nis cumulative in the sense that the body of information in\nthe cultural repository does not remain static, but can itself grow\nlarger and more complex. Grass huts evolve into wood-frame houses,\nthen brick buildings, and eventually skyscrapers. Tribal leaders\nevolve into kings, then emperors, then prime ministers. Simple sets of\nnorms evolve into more complicated informal institutions, then\nbyzantine formalized legal codes. As each generation adds its own new\ninnovations, discoveries, and improvements, functional sophistication\nis accumulated in cultural traits in much the same way as it is\naccumulated in genetic traits.\n\nThis general evolutionary outlook gives reason to think that as human\ngroups increased in size, they also grew in their capacity to carry\nmore culture and produce more cultural innovations (Kline & Boyd\n2010; J. Henrich 2015: chapter 12), though the causal relationship\nbetween population size and cultural complexity remains controversial\n(Fogarty & Creanza 2017, cf. Vaesen et al. 2016). As cultural\ninnovations continued to accumulate, they allowed humans to more\nsignificantly control and reshape the environments in which they\nlived. Such transformations also reshaped the environments inhabited\nby subsequent generations, thus shifting the contours of the physical,\nsocial, and informational niches in which they evolved. Such changes,\nin turn, created a range of new selection pressures, many of which\nfavored bodies, brains, and minds better equipped for sociality and\ncultural inheritance. Researchers continue to develop and debate the\nmerits of different conceptual tools with which to conceive of this\nkind of evolutionary dynamic (Tomasello 1999; Laland, Odling-Smee,\n& Feldman 2001; Laland, Odling-Smee, & Myles 2010; Sterelny\n2003, 2012; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tennie, Call, & Tomasello\n2009; Boyd, Richerson, & Henrich 2011, J. Henrich 2015; Boyd\n2017).\n\nHumans are able to inhabit a wide range of environments, and socially\ntransmitted information\u2014as opposed to innately specified and\nbiologically transmitted information\u2014is particularly useful in\nthe face of ecological and social variation (Richerson & Boyd\n2013). Information about which plants in various environments are\nedible and which are toxic has straightforward adaptive advantage.\nInformation about what kinds of norms prevail in various social\nenvironments is also important, and knowing it allows individuals to\nsmoothly participate in their community and coordinate with other\nmembers in an array of collective activities that ranges from\nproducing food and raising children to responding to threats and\ndealing with outsiders (Chudek & Henrich 2011). While different\ntypes of cultural variants can be useful in different ways,\nnot all socially transmittable information is equally valuable, and\nindividuals are not indiscriminate social learners. Theorists posit\nthat human minds evolved to contain a number of social learning\nbiases or heuristics that help facilitate more\nselective learning. These influence which, of the many cultural\nvariants to which an individual is exposed, she will actually adopt\nfor herself. Two heuristics appear to be particularly important in\namplifying the advantages of a system of cultural inheritance. One is\na conformity bias, which prompts individuals to adopt those\ncultural variants that have been adopted by most others in their\ncommunity (Muthukrishna, Morgan, & Henrich 2016), and another is a\nprestige bias, which sensitizes individuals to hierarchy and\nstatus, prompting them to model their behavior on those who have\nachieved success and high social rank (J. Henrich & Gil-White\n2001; Cheng et al. 2012; Maner 2017). In addition to these two,\nresearchers have posited other learning biases that can influence norm\nacquisition, including one that makes information about norms easier\nto remember than other, non-normative information about behavior\n(O\u2019Gorman, Wilson, & Miller 2008).\n\nCulture looms increasingly large in evolutionary explanations of human\nultrasociality, i.e., our species\u2019 ability to cooperate on a\nremarkably large scale (Tomasello 2009, 2016; Richerson 2013; though\nsee Hagen & Hammerstein 2006; Burnham & Johnson 2005 for\nalternative views, and Sterelny, Calcott, & Fraser 2013 for\nbroader context on the evolution of cooperation). An increasingly\nprominent idea is that explaining the full range of behaviors involved\nin human sociality will require some appeal not just to culture in\ngeneral, but to culturally transmitted norms and institutions in\nparticular (Mathew, Boyd, & van Veelen 2013). Some have taken the\nsignificance and complexity of the adaptive challenges posed by\nlarge-scale cooperation to have implications for human psychology,\narguing from these grounds that human minds have a capacity specific to\nnorms (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013), which may have evolved in\ntandem with our capacities for language (Lamm 2014). Others argue\nfurther that cultural group selection, generated by various forms of\ncompetition between cultural groups like communities, tribes, clans,\nand even nations, has contributed to the spread of more effective\ncooperative norms (Turchin 2018; Richerson, Baldini, et al. 2016,\nthough see Krasnow et al. 2015). On such views, these kinds of\nselective pressures further remodeled human social psychology,\nsupplementing more evolutionarily ancient social instincts to form\nwhat have been called tribal social instincts (Richerson & Boyd\n2001; Boyd & Richerson 2008; Richerson & Henrich 2012). This family of\nevolutionarily recent \u201cinstincts\u201d is posited as including\na capacity for norms, but also other psychological features thought to\nrefine norm-guided behavior in various ways, including sensitivities\nto markers of tribal membership and the boundaries between ethnic\ngroups (McElreath, Boyd, & Richerson 2003) and social emotions\nlike guilt, pride, and loyalty.\n",
