    "main_text": "Emotions and Intentional Objects\n4. Emotions and Intentional Objects\n\nTo shed light on the sense in which emotions can be justified requires\na brief detour on the topic of their \u201cobject-directedness\u201d\nor \u201caboutness\u201d or \u201cintentionality\u201d. The first\ndistinction we need to draw is the one between particular\nobjects and formal objects of emotions. As Kenny (1963) first\nemphasized, any X that I can have emotion E\nabout is a particular object of E, whereas the formal\nobject of E is the property which I implicitly ascribe to\nX by virtue of having E about X.\n\nFor example, the particular object of fear is anything a person can be\nafraid of, whereas the formal object of fear is \u201cthat which\nconstitutes danger\u201d, on the assumption that only what is\nevaluated as dangerous can intelligibly be feared. Particular and\nformal objects constitute the two principal aspects of emotional\nintentionality: emotions are object-directed insofar as they\nhave particular objects, and they are fitting insofar as\ntheir particular objects instantiate the formal objects represented by\nthe emotion (see\n section 10.1).\n\nThe second distinction we wish to draw is that between two types of\nparticular objects of emotions: target objects and propositional\nobjects (de Sousa 1987). The target object of an emotion is the\nspecific entity the emotion is about. For example, love can be about\nMary, or about Bangkok, or about Homer Simpson and so on. These are\nall possible targets of love, and they may be real or imaginary.\n\nNot every emotion has a target. I may be angry that my life has turned\nout a certain way, without there being any particular\nentity\u2014myself or anyone else\u2014at which my anger is\ndirected. Propositional objects capture facts or states of affairs,\nreal or imagined, towards which my emotion is directed. Conversely,\nnot all emotions have a propositional object. For example, if Mary is\nthe target of my love, there may be no proposition, however complex,\nthat captures what it is that I love about Mary (Kraut 1986; Rorty\n1987 [1988]). \n\nFinally, there also appear to be affective states that lack both types\nof particular objects: they are neither directed at a particular\nentity nor are they about a state of affairs captured by a\nproposition. For example, I can be depressed or elated but not\ndepressed or elated about any specific target or fact. These seemingly\nobjectless affective states share many properties with object-directed\nemotions, especially with respect to their physiological and\nmotivational aspects, so we may consider them to be emotions without\nobjects.\n\nOn the other hand, some have suggested that such objectless states are\nbetter regarded as moods (Frijda 1994; Stephan 2017a). Whether we think\nof seemingly objectless affective states as emotions or moods, we must\ndecide what kinds of objects they lack. Here two main options are\navailable. The first is to assert that some affective states have\nneither particular objects nor formal objects. If we think of moods\nand objectless emotions that way, it becomes hard to explain how such\naffective states may have conditions of correctness\u2014formal\nobjects being among other things descriptions of what the world must\nbe like for the affective state to be fitting (Teroni\n2007).\n\nIf instead we think of such affective states as having formal objects\nand conditions of correctness, then their objectlessness is only\napparent, because they need to have targets or propositional objects\nof some kind to which they implicitly ascribe the property defined by\nthe formal object. This is the view of moods defended among others by\nGoldie (2000), who thinks moods take the whole world as their object,\nand by Price (2006), who thinks that moods have generic objects but\n\u201cwatch out\u201d for particular ones. \n\nWhat are the formal objects of specific emotions? This is a\ncontroversial topic, because the ascription of formal objects commits\none to the claim that each emotion, on conceptual grounds, ascribes a\nspecific property to its particular object. This is often identified\nwith one of a number of \u201ccore relational themes\u201d\noriginally offered by Richard Lazarus (1991a,b) to explain what sorts\nof evaluations cause emotions, one of the primary concerns of\nappraisal theories in psychology\n (section 6).\n\nWithin that framework, anger represents slights, fear represents\ndangers, shame represents failures to live up to an ego ideal, sadness\nrepresents losses, happiness represents progress towards goal\nachievement, pride represents enhancement of one\u2019s ego identity\n(Prinz 2004; Lazarus 1991b). Once the formal object of an emotion has\nbeen clarified, we can use it to justify emotions by citing their\nconditions of elicitation. For example, if anger represents slights,\nthen my antagonist\u2019s deprecatory tone can be cited as a\njustification of my anger, because a deprecatory tone instantiates the\nvery property that anger represents.\n",
