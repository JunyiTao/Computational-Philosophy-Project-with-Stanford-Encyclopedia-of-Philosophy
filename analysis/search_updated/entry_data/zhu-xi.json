    "preamble": "\n\nZhu Xi, the preeminent Neo-Confucian (daoxue) master of the\nSouthern Song (1126\u20131271), is generally ranked as second only to\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BCE) in influence and as rivaling Zhuangzi\n(fourth century BCE) in philosophic acumen in the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition. A leading scholar and classicist as well as\nsharp intellect and devoted practitioner, Zhu Xi worked out a\nphilosophically compelling synthesis of the ideas of the Northern Song\n(960\u20131126 CE) masters Zhou Dunyi (1017\u201373), Zhang Zai\n(1020\u201377), and the brothers Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) and Cheng\nHao (1032\u201385). Intriguingly, his idea of a holistic synthetic\napproach itself may have been inspired in part by Huayan Buddhism\n(Ivanhoe 2000:\n 47\u201349).[1]\n Over time, Zhu Xi\u2019s Neo-Confucian synthesis proved to be a\npotent philosophic catalyst for his intellectual supporters and\nopponents alike, until the fall of Imperial China in 1911 and beyond.\nHis influence gradually extended to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, as\nwell, each of which adapted his thought along with the Confucian\nclassics and traditions in its own distinctive way. Besides synthesizing key\nNorthern Song Neo-Confucian ideas, Zhu researched and reflected on the\nreceived Five Classics (Changes, Odes, History, Rites, and\nSpring and Autumn Annals), and compiled, edited, and\ncommented on a compendium of essential Confucian texts, the Great\nLearning (Daxue), the Analects (Lunyu)\nof Confucius, the Book of Mencius (Mengzi), and the\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong), titled the\nFour Books (Sishu). He also prepared an edition of\nthe Songs of the South (Chuci) to be appended to the\nOdes.\n\nNotably, from the Great Learning Zhu adapted and distilled\nthe methodology of investigating things to extend knowledge while from\nthe Mean he stressed attuning oneself to attain utmost\npropriety. Investigating things incorporated reading and classical\nstudies but ensured one\u2019s practical grasp of and personal\nresonance with the pulse of life: nature and phenomena as well as\nsociety and human relations and concerns (Gardner 1986, 1990).\nAttuning oneself involved reverent concentration and mindful\nreflection and practice. A century later, Yuan dynasty\n(1271\u20131368) officialdom adopted Zhu Xi\u2019s edition of the\nFour Books as the basis for the Imperial Examination System,\nin effect canonizing it until the termination of the imperial\nexamination system toward the end of the Qing dynasty\n(1644\u20131911) in 1908. The change from the Five Classics\nto the Four Books as the basis of the imperial examination\nsystem resulted in a reform and renewal of the Confucian tradition and\noutlook. It effected a restoration of Confucius\u2019 original\nconcern with personal ethical cultivation, realization, and practice\nfrom the more bureaucratic, careerist approach taken by many\nConfucians of the succeeding Han and Tang dynasties (206 BCE\u2013905\nCE) that had weakened the tradition spiritually. Zhu Xi\u2019s spirit\nand thought were deeply rooted in the original teachings of Confucius\nand his early school, as well as in the seminal ideas of the Northern\nSong masters, and exerted a profound influence in China and around\nEast Asia for centuries.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nZhu Xi was born in Youqi in Fujian in October 1130. Many anecdotes\nattest that he was a highly precocious child. It was recorded that at\nage five he ventured to ask what lay beyond Heaven, and by eight he\nunderstood the significance of the Classic of Filiality\n(Xiaojing). As a youth, he was inspired by Mencius\u2019\nproposition that all people could become a sage. In Zhu Xi\u2019s\nchildhood, his father Zhu Song (1097\u20131143) arranged for several\nold friends to educate Zhu Xi after his passing. Consequently, Zhu Xi\nwas educated by several eclectic scholars who had delved into Daoism\nand Buddhism as well as Confucianism, and inclined him to be deep and\nwide-ranging in his intellectual predilections and cultural interests.\nLater he studied Chan (Zen) Buddhism with the monk Dao Qian of the\nKaishan Temple, and reputedly met with the Chan master Da Hui (Dahui\nZonggao,\n 1089\u20131163).[2]\n Traces of Huayan\u2019s holistic thought can also be discerned in\nthe formation of Zhu Xi\u2019s system (Makeham 2018). Remarkably, Zhu\npassed the official jinshi exam (the \u201cpresented\nscholar\u201d exam) at just nineteen, drawing on Chan Buddhism in his\n answers.[3]\n He continued to pursue Daoism and Buddhism until he met the\nNeo-Confucian master Li Tong (1093\u20131163) a decade later, and\nformally became his student in 1160. In fact, Zhu\u2019s father had\nrecommended that he conduct his advanced studies under Li Tong, but\nZhu postponed seeing Li for years until he finally admitted to himself\nthat he was no longer making progress in his eclectic cultivation and\nsuffered spiritual doubts. Li Tong was a master in the southern Yang\nShi (1053\u20131135) lineage of the Cheng brothers\u2019 school,\npartial to the teachings of Cheng Yi. Importantly, Li Tong convinced\nZhu of the cogency and superiority of the Confucian Way and\ncultivation. Meanwhile, having passed the jinshi examination,\nZhu was eligible to hold office, and had been assigned to several\nprefectural administrative posts. But, since he disagreed with central\ncourt policy on several major issues, he preferred to hold temple\nguardianships, which gave him the leisure to conduct Confucian studies\nand cultivation in earnest, and shielded him from the ruthless court\npolitics. Having chosen this career path, Zhu Xi had the leisure to\nstudy and reflect, so over time he made numerous contributions in\nclassical studies, historical inquiries, literary studies, and\nphilosophic reflections. He moreover developed into a man of letters\nand wrote subtle prose and elegant verse.\n\nA renowned teacher in later life, Zhu taught the classics and\nNeo-Confucian thought and practice to hundreds if not thousands of\nstudents. His oral discourses and discussions are preserved in the\nClassified Dialogues of Master Zhu (Zhuzi yulei),\nand his poetry, essays, correspondence, and other prose works are\ncollected in the Collected Works of Master Zhu (Zhuzi\nwenji). He also published critical, annotated editions of several\nclassics, including the Book of Change (Yijing) and\nthe Book of Odes (Shijing), essential works of\nNeo-Confucianism, including by Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai, and the Cheng\nbrothers, and a vital Neo-Confucian anthology, Reflections on\nThings at Hand (Jinsilu). He also edited and annotated\nan important early text of inner alchemy Daoism; the Cantong\nqi (Unity of the Three) by Wei Boyang (3rd\ncent. CE), which combines the cosmology of the Yijing and the\nDaoist teaching of wuwei (non-intentional action) with inner\nalchemy. Zhu Xi remained devoted to his spiritual and intellectual\nwork virtually to his last breath, pondering and discussing\nproblematic passages in the Great Learning during the last\nseveral days of his life. Throughout his life, Zhu Xi sought to\nreestablish the fundamental concepts and values of Confucianism to\nrestore China\u2019s cultural and political integrity as a Confucian\nsociety, especially since people in search of spiritual guidance and\nsolace were increasingly looking to Daoism and Buddhism rather than\nConfucianism, which was perceived as a state ideology and orthodoxy\nand had lost spiritual and ethical purchase. Moreover, Zhu believed\nthat the empire needed the spiritual \u00e9lan of\nConfucius\u2019 original ethical ideas and values to meet the\nchallenge of barbarian encroachments. His own sincere patriotism,\ncommitment to the tradition, and devotion to learning and scholarship\nhave remained an inspiration to this day in East Asia and throughout\nthe world.\n2. Philosophy of Human Nature and Approach to Self-Cultivation\n\nZhu Xi developed a theory of basic human propensities (nature,\nxing) to account for both the possibility of human evil and\nthat of human goodness and perfectibility. On this theory, while\n(following Mencius, 372\u2013289 BCE) insisting that people are\nbasically good (well intended and sensitive to the sufferings of\nothers), he accepted that the manner in which a person\u2019s basic\ndisposition is manifested is conditioned and at times contained by\ntheir specific qi endowment (native talents and\ngifts, qizhi), family and social environment, and other\nfactors. Such factors together yield their empirical personality,\nintelligence, and aptitude for spiritual-ethical cultivation. Zhu\naccepted that there are real differences in individual disposition,\ncharacter, as well as aptitude for ethical self-cultivation and\nrealization, owing to individual variations in\nqi endowment, environment, etc. Furthermore, he argued that\npeople can become bad or evil due, for example, to a coarse or sensual\nqi endowment, the bad influence of ruthless kin or friends, a\nselfish or harsh social environment, a cruel streak, etc. Nonetheless,\nfollowing Mencius, he firmly believed that anyone who was sincerely\ncommitted to moral self-cultivation and was fervent in their moral practice\nwould surely make progress in achieving moral realization if not sagehood.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s teacher, Li Tong, and friend, Zhang Shi (1133\u20131180),\npresented him with different approaches to cultivation based on the\npremise of basic still and active mindsets, respectively. But, Zhu\nfound that both of these approaches were one-sided and flawed. How is\none to leap from quiet-sitting and stillness to making timely moral\nresponses? When does one have the composure to introspect morally when\ntheir mind is constantly active and engaged? If neither the meditative\napproach nor the active approach to cultivation and practice were\nefficacious, what path remained open to Zhu Xi? Recent research shows\nthat Zhu Xi embarked on a careful reading of the works of Zhou Dunyi\nduring this period of spiritual-philosophical crisis in the course of which he\nrediscovered Zhou\u2019s doctrine of \u201cthe interpenetration of\nstillness and activity\u201d for the human mind and spirit (Adler\n2014). With this idea, Zhou Dunyi was advocating that whereas the\nstates of action and rest are mutually exclusive in the case of\nphysical objects, such states interpenetrate and are mutually\nimplicative in the case of human mental and spiritual phenomena (Adler\n2014). This doctrine piqued Zhu Xi\u2019s interest, and he came to\nsee it as offering a way out of the dilemma between Li Tong\u2019s\nstress on stillness and Hu Hong\u2019s stress on activity in\ncultivation and practice, and their respective shortcomings. Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s doctrine was particularly exciting to Zhu Xi for it\nhighlighted the distinctness and potential religiosity of the human\nmind and spirit, which Zhou describes as not subject to the same\nlimitations and restrictions as are physical phenomena. Zhou Dunyi\nmoreover associates this idea with a vital and well integrated model\nof human mind and spirit, self-cultivation, and cosmos. Inspired by\nZhou Dunyi\u2019s doctrine of the interpenetration of stillness and\nactivity and related ideas, Zhu Xi worked out a twofold cultivation\neffort that incorporated at once nurturing one\u2019s feeling of\nreverence (jing) to purify mind while investigating things to\ndiscern their determinate or defining patterns (li).\nCultivation of reverence, originally a religious virtue associated\nwith ancestor worship and ceremonial rites, as described in the\nclassics and taught by Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE), serves to purify\nthe mind, attune one to the promptings of the original good nature,\nand set one to act with appropriateness (yi). Moreover, by\ngrasping the defining patterns (li) of relationship and\nintercourse that constitute the world, society, people, and proper\nconduct, one gains the master key to acting with utmost propriety\n(zhongyong). The mind that is imbued with reverence and\ncomprehends these patterns will develop into a good will\n(zhuzai) dedicated to acting appropriately and with utmost\npropriety. Since jing takes on connotations of focus,\nconcentration, and alertness, as well as reverence in Zhu Xi\u2019s\ndiscourses, mindfulness has been suggested as the English translation\nthat covers the fullness of the term jing (Kalton 1988) in\nZhu Xi\u2019s thought.\n\nIn later life, Zhu started to regard this twofold approach to\ncultivation and realization as too complicated, gradual, and difficult\nto carry out in practice. Like Confucius before him and anticipating\nWang Yangming after him, Zhu Xi came to accept that the sincere\nConfucian adept must, on embarking on his or her project of ethical\nself-cultivation, first strive to establish his or her sincere\ndetermination (lizhi) to realize the cardinal Confucian\nvirtues and become an exemplary person (junzi), that is to\nsay, a master of appropriateness in interpersonal conduct and human\naffairs generally.\n3. Ethical Philosophy\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s methodology for achieving perspicacity (ming)\nin ethical judgment and \u201cappropriateness\u201d (yi) in\npractice can be summed up in his call to investigate things to extend\nknowledge (gewu zhizhi). Zhu advocated this methodology to\nstress the need for people, as prospective moral agents, to notice the\nfine details, the distinguishing features of particular situations and\nto fashion on that basis the most discerning, appropriate response.\nThese distinguishing features can suggest alternative moral\nconsiderations to be weighed (Pincoffs 1986). This call lay behind\nZhu\u2019s promotion of the Great Learning (Daxue)\nand call for life-long learning and moral reflection in a bid to\nachieve a modicum of objectivity and break free of the moral\nintuitionism and resultant subjectivism typical of Neo-Confucians of\nhis generation.\n3.1 Investigating Things for Ethical Discernment and Practice\n\nThroughout his career, Zhu Xi focused on the twin problems of 1)\ndetermining the conditions of moral agency, and 2) setting forth a\nviable program of moral self-cultivation on that basis. Zhu saw moral\nagency as the expression of a moral will, which he understood to be\nthe achievement of an inner self-mastery (zhuzai) that forms\nthe core of a person\u2019s moral character, perceptivity,\ncognizance, and responsiveness. On this view, self-cultivation that is\naimed at nurturing self-mastery must include forming a concentrated,\nreverential mind-set (jing) and a discerning sense of\nappropriateness. Early on, Zhu had emphasized the need to attain a\nworking knowledge of the constitutive patterning (li) of\nreality and society in the light of which the norms and ritual action\n(li) prescribed for proper interpersonal relationships and\nintercourse are devised. He later found that establishing the\ndetermination (lizhi) to seek self-realization and conduct\noneself appropriately counted for as much as the long-term cultivation\nprocess itself, during which one can lose sight of one\u2019s purpose\nand be side-tracked (see Qian Mu 1986: 123\u2013127). Moreover, while\nstill maintaining the importance of the norms and ritual action for\ncharacter-building and the social order, Zhu began to emphasize the\nneed to build up a sympathetic but realistic grasp of the warp and\nwoof of real daily human life viewed in the perspective of such broad\nConfucian ethical ideals as humaneness (ren) and fairness\n(gong). He understood that, although the norms and ritual\naction are broadly applicable and reliable, many situations call for\nspecifically tailored\n responses.[4]\n\nConsequently, against the moral intuitionism prevalent at the time in\nNeo-Confucianism, as espoused by his teacher Li Tong\n(1093\u20131163), his intellectual rival Lu Jiuyuan\n(1139\u20131193), and others, Zhu argued that intuitionism is\ninadequate for dealing effectively with the complex human affairs that\npeople are apt to encounter in their\n lives.[5]\n Rather, he advocated dedicating oneself to the observation and study\nof the patterning/patterns (li) of relationship, interaction,\nand change among all things, among human beings in particular. He\nregarded \u201cinvestigating things to extend knowledge\u201d as the\nsurest way to deepen and broaden one\u2019s discernment of the\npatterns that constitute the lived-world. Such knowledge, importantly,\nwould sharpen one\u2019s sense of appropriateness by attuning oneself\nto the actual, subtle, distinguishing features of particular\nsituations.\n\nAgain, Zhu Xi conceived the world as a patterned (li)\ntotality made up of a cosmic vapor (qi) that under various\nconditions condenses and solidifies into countless permutations, from\nthe purest transparent yuanqi (primordial qi), to\nthe Yin-Yang poles modulated by the primal taiji\n(supreme polarity) pattern, to the wuxing (five phases), each\nof which bears an identifying inner pattern and set of propensities\n(xing) that involve interconvertability and recombination\nwith the other four phases, and finally to the phenomenal world:\nHeaven, Earth, and the myriad things (tiandi\n wanwu).[6]\n\n\nFor Zhu Xi, the world presents a vital tapestry of relationships,\ncycles, processes, events, and things that are spontaneously arrayed\nin aesthetic order. In the nexus of these arrays, li are\nmanifested three dimensionally and present different faces from\ndifferent angles (Graham 1986a: 148; Qian Mu 1986: 133). Li\nare inherently perspectival. Zhu adopts metaphors of the grains in\nwood, the lines in jade, the \u201cveins\u201d in a leaf, the lines\nin marble, and even the sinewy texture of beef, to stress that li\nare manifested immanently rather than abstractly, and thus are to be\nsought concretely by observing phenomena in the world, not by pure,\ndisengaged, abstract ratiocination (Needham 1956a: 473). Moreover,\nli are never presented in their putative optimal pure form.\nThey always appear conditioned by the degree of purity of the\nqi through which they are manifested and of the environing\nconditions (Wade 2003).\n\nLi also structure the human mind, thought, and language, such\nthat human beings are predisposed to grasp and attempt to respond\nappropriately to the things and situations they\n encounter.[7]\n Objective learning on this view can be understood as a facet of\nself-learning: indeed, by the principle of continuity, objective\nunderstanding enhances self-understanding, for by comprehending the\nwarp and woof of the outer li of things, one gains insight\ninto the inner li constituting one\u2019s mind and character\n(Qian Mu 1971: II 31\u201338). For Zhu Xi, while li\nstructure the mind, thought, and language, this is not just at the\ncognitive level: li also structure the inner patterning\n(xing) and basic impulses that predispose us to have\ncharacteristically human emotions (qing), relationships, and\nresponses (ganying) under various sets of conditions (Graham\n1986a: 152\u2013154; Qian Mu 1971: II. 25\u201330). In Zhu\u2019s\nConfucian view, li and xing predispose one to be\nsensitive and responsive; metaphorically, they provide the hardware of\nhuman nature. Self-cultivation and moral reflection are the means by\nwhich one actively conditions and fine-tunes these predispositions of\nsensitivity and response. They thus function as indispensable software\nfor cultivating personhood. \n\nThese are the contours of Zhu Xi\u2019s approach to moral\nself-cultivation and interpersonal ethics. The standard ethical norms\nwork well in standard situations, normal families, good communities,\nand ordinary social circumstances. But, Zhu also understood that\npeople are richly complicated and that human affairs often become\ncomplex, get out of hand, and go awry. Life is just not that ideal,\nnot that simple. We sometimes encounter ethically anomalous situations\nto which the standard sets of feelings and responses as prescribed by\nthe received norms and ritual actions simply do not fit. In many\ninstances, standing on the norm and being moralistic simply would make\nmatters worse. Zhu himself said that one must have ample experience\nand self-cultivation so that,\n\n\nIf, by chance, an anomalous affair should come up, one could\ncomprehend it. One wants to be in a position to grasp such affairs\nthoroughly in order to understand their unfamiliar aspects. (YL: ch.\n19)\n\n\nZhu Xi considered how to tailor responses appropriate in problematic\nsituations under the rubric of quan (weighing things up,\ndiscretion, expedient\n means).[8]\n He noted several kinds of situations in which recourse to discretion\nand expedient means might be advisable: 1) extraordinary situations\nthat cannot be covered by the standard norms and ritual actions, 2)\nurgent situations that require a direct violation of the received\nnorms and ritual actions to be satisfactorily resolved, and 3)\nsituations in which it would be more humane and prudent not to observe the relevant\nnorms and ritual actions (see Wei 1986). Situations of the first kind\ninclude those that call for a disruption of the given human order, for\nexample the removal of an evil authority figure, such as a psychotic\nparent or a sociopathic tyrant. For situations of the second kind, Zhu had\nin mind emergencies when one would have to violate a norm in order to\nperform an emergency action, such as grasping the hand of a drowning\nsister-in-law, or shoving an old lady out of the path of a runaway\n oxcart.[9]\n Finally, the third kind of situation includes those in which it would\nbe more compassionate to waive or overlook the ritual prescriptions,\nsuch as in cases of condoning the remarriage of a widow who would\notherwise be destined to isolation and destitution.\n\nClearly, such considerations lead us into unmapped ethical terrain.\nHow far can one justifiably take such sidestepping of the received\napplicable norms and ritual actions? What qualifications and\nrestrictions might apply? For his part, Zhu Xi mentioned at least two\nqualifications: a weak qualification that the expedient adopted not be\notherwise ethically objectionable, and a stronger qualification\nstipulating that the expedient adopted be in compliance with the Way,\ni.e., that it satisfy some basic moral value, at least as basic as the\nvalues expressed in the relevant received norm and ritual action.\nThus, any exercise of discretion that is undertaken in light of\none\u2019s sense of appropriateness (yi), if exercised with\nsufficient probity and care, should satisfy the moral values embodied\nin the Way more adequately than would a routine observance of the\nstandard norm. Humaneness is the core moral value that was invoked\nmost often in such cases, but there are a number of others: filial\npiety, fraternity, fidelity, empathy, compassion, appropriateness,\netc. Famous examples from the Confucian tradition include\nMencius\u2019 reminder that one should overturn the propriety of not\ngrasping the hand of a member of the opposite sex in order to rescue a\ndrowning sister in law (Mencius 4A.17), and Cheng Yi argued\nfor an exception to the impropriety of widows remarrying on the basis\nof filial piety (Rosenlee 2006: 134). Similarly, Socrates showed that\nJustice is not always realized by observance of the proprieties of\ntruth-telling and faithfully returning a friend\u2019s property\n(Plato Republic 331c).\n\nNonetheless, ever cognizant of temptation and moral weakness, Zhu\ninsisted on the well established probity and integrity of anyone who\nwould venture to use discretion and exercise expedient means. He\nstated:\n\n\nIntending to weigh up a situation carefully [in order to exercise\nexpedient means], one must have cultivated the inner root daily, so\nthat one\u2019s mind is sensitive, perspicacious, pure, and\nintegrated; [even in that case,] one still must naturally weigh up\nsuch situations most carefully. As Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) said: Be\nreverent in order to straighten oneself within; practice\nappropriateness in order to square situations without. One\u2019s\nsense of appropriateness comprises the moral fiber which one expresses\nthrough sincere ritual action (YL 37, 37:6a, par. 36).\n\n\nOnly those who have extensively \u201cinvestigated things to extend\nknowledge\u201d, and who are conversant with the subtle patternings\nof the human heart and human affairs would be qualified to consider\nexercising expedient means over simply following the norms. (Zhu knew\nthat this ethical knowledge is as much a matter of practical\nexperience as of book learning. At times, he told his occasionally\npriggish students that well-disposed people, even if morally\nuntutored, can be more discerning and have better discretion than are\nsome academicians!)\n\nWhile Zhu stressed making careful observations in situations in order\nto tailor the most fitting responses in context, at the same time he\nenvisioned a cultivation process whereby one discerns ever more\nfundamental and yet far-reaching patterns (li) that shape\nnature and moral value. That is, Zhu sometimes construed the project\nof investigating things to extend knowledge as an ascendant movement\nwhereby the learner finally arrives at the\npinnacle\u2014taiji (supreme polarity) that embraces and\nsubsumes all derived patterns. To Zhu, grasping taiji in this\nsense was tantamount to grasping the master key, for it represented to\nhim the apex of being and value, and bestowed realization and sagehood\non those who sincerely and authentically comprehended and embraced\n it.[10]\n While this conception charts an ideal path to the pure, compassionate\nmind-set of sagehood, it obscures Zhu Xi\u2019s usual emphasis on\nfine-tuning and sharpening one\u2019s moral discernment and\nresponsiveness in the midst of things\u2014in full view of the\nsituatedness of people in their daily life. This conception also\nneglects Zhu\u2019s equal emphasis on the claim that patterns as\ninborn propensities (xing) are manifested only in concrete\nspecific qi formations, and thus that 1) patterns are to be\ndiscerned in their fine particularity, that 2) the moral impulses are\nto be nurtured in the stream of human life, and that 3) the emotions,\nwhen not obscured by desires or obsessions, for the most part are\nimmediate expressions of the basic natural impulses.\n\nHow, too, to square this broad vision of probing inquiry and deep\nunderstanding with the potentially constrictive Confucian moral\npsychology constructed tightly round the virtues of humaneness,\nappropriateness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, and their attendant\nemotions? Zhu Xi likely realized that these virtues functioned as\nthematic foci for cultivation as one establishes ones moral\norientation and bearings and a balanced interpersonal stance. One\nneeds to go through an initial stage of mastering these basic virtues\nin order to 1) reinforce one\u2019s altruistic impulses and curtail\nthe egoistic ones, 2) be inclined to seek principled rapport and\nharmony in interpersonal affairs, and 3) be moved by a sense of\noneness with others and all things. Subsequently, the more ethical\nhuman phenomena one observes and considers in advanced level learning\nand cultivation, the more one feels a broad sympathy for others that\ntranscends the narrowly-graded love, the so-called love with\ndistinctions that is attributed to the notion of ren\n(humaneness) in Confucianism (see Mencius, 1A.7, 3A.5, and\n7A.45). The more one observes the nuances of human affairs and the\nsprings of human action, the more one will express deference and\nrespect in ways that do not necessarily coincide exactly with the\ngeneral prescriptions of the norms and ritual actions. In this way,\none will build up a repertoire of conduct that reflects one\u2019s\npersonal ethical discernment and discretion, which expresses\none\u2019s personal ethical attainment and style.\n\nZhu Xi on occasion modeled his ethical conception of observing\nsituations and fashioning the most appropriate response\nnaturalistically on the butcher character, Cook Ding, portrayed in the\nZhuangzi as a skilled artisan: just as the sure blade of Cook\nDing\u2019s cleaver goes straight to the cartilage between the bones,\nthe cultivated sense of appropriateness (yi) of Zhu\nXi\u2019s moral adept strikes right at the heart of interpersonal\nsituations (see Thompson 1988: 39\u201340). A.C. Graham once\ncontrasted Zhu\u2019s perception/response model (gan-ying)\nof ethical action with that of Zhuangzi by suggesting that Zhu\u2019s\nnotion of appropriate response was informed by rigorous adherence to\nrules and principles, whereas Zhuangzi\u2019s was relatively\nintuitive and spontaneous (Graham 1986a: 143\u2013145). This apparent\ncontrast can be resolved by separating the stages of cultivation and\nmastery: Zhuangzi\u2019s skilled artisans, such as Butcher Ding, all\nhad to undergo prolonged periods of rigorously controlled\napprenticeship before they could \u201cforget\u201d the\n\u201cknowing that\u201d in an integrated, spontaneous process of\n\u201cknowing how\u201d. For his part, Zhu Xi knew that the years of\nlearning and practice\u2014one\u2019s moral\napprenticeship\u2014culminates in a responsive moral agent who can\noperate as intuitively and spontaneously in his or her personal and\nsocial ethical sphere as do Zhuangzi\u2019s skilled artisans in\n theirs.[11]\n Zhu\u2019s moral adept is in effect an artisan of interpersonal\nintercourse. Zhu could rightfully claim Confucius as a prime model for\nthis view. After decades of cultivation, Confucius could say,\n\u201cAt sixty, my ear was attuned. At seventy, I could give my heart\nfree rein and without overstepping the mark\u201d (Analects\n2.4).\n\nViewed as a quest for knowledge as responsive pattern (li)\ndiscernment, enhanced by association, analogical reasoning, and\ngeneralization, Zhu Xi\u2019s approach to inquiry dovetails with\nrecent studies on strategies for learning for effective, ethical\nliving. Neuroscientist and gerontologist Daniel J. Levitin writes\nconcerning intelligence and wisdom,\n\nHumans excel at... making associations, taking information... and\nseeing how it interacts with other information. Whenever we encounter\nnew information, our brains place it in a conceptual frame and then\nseek to associate it with other things we have experienced. The brain\nis a giant pattern detector\u2026. Our brains add to that the\nability to form analogies, \u2026 [to perform] analogical\nreasoning. The wisdom we find in older adults follow[s] from \u2026\nthese four things: association, experience, pattern recognition, and\nthe use of analogies. And, this is why we we gain more and more wisdom\nas we age. Wisdom comes from the accumulated sets of things we\u2019ve seen\nand experienced, our ability to detect patterns in those experiences,\nand our ability to predict future outcomes based on them. (And what is\nintelligence if not that?)  Naturally, the more you have experienced,\nthe more wisdom you are able to tap into\u2026. [Old-timers] have\nbeen witness to so many things that seem to cycle around again and\nagain. Wisdom enables you to handle some problems more quickly and\neffectively than the raw firepower of youth. [In sum, m]aking\nassociations underpins learning. To assimilate new information we need\nto associate it with what we\u2019ve seen before. Life experience gives us\nmore associations to make, more patterns (li) to\nrecognize. (Levitin 2020, pp. 119\u2013120)\n\nOn the surface, it appears that while Zhu Xi\u2019s method of inquiry\nis specialized and prescriptive, Levitin\u2019s presentation is\nmerely descriptive of normal human learning. However, Levitin is\ndescribing the optimal learning strategies of people who remain\nsensitive, alert, discerning, and responsive throughout mature life,\ntraits that some people nurture going forward and that others ought to\nmake efforts to cultivate themselves in order to be more vital, understanding, and effective human actors and lead more fulfilling lives.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s appropriateness approach to ethics has several distinct\nfeatures. First, one is to be well-versed in the received norms and\nrituals that circumscribe interpersonal relationships and prescribe\nproper behavior in family and society. Second, one is to have made\nample observations and responses in real life situations. Third, one\nis to have examined and reflected on ways in which others act and\nrespond in situations, for reference. Fourth, through extensive\nobservation and experience, one is to be cognizant of the range of\nconsiderations that come into play in real life situations: moral\nprinciple, utility, fairness, sympathy, compassion, and so\n forth.[12]\n Fifth, one is to remain flexible and open-minded as well as avoid\nmaking surmises, being insistent, stubborn, or self-centered\n(Analects 9.4). According to this view, while observing the\nethical norms and rules of thumb in his or her community, the moral\nadept possesses a store of personal ethical sensitivity,\nresponsiveness, and resourcefulness, by which to fashion the most\nfitting responses to situations.\n3.2 Moral Cosmic Synthesis\n\nIn his watershed essay, A Treatise on Humanity\n(Renshuo), Zhu Xi discourses on the classical Confucian\nteaching of humanity (ren) in a unified cosmic and human\nperspective. In concluding, he criticizes alternative accounts of\nhumanity, i.e., Confucius\u2019 spirit of humaneness, on various\nconceptual and ethical\n grounds.[13]\n Following the early Han tradition, Zhu opens by associating humaneness with\ncosmic creativity. In its most basic manifestation, humaneness is\ncharacterized as the impulse of \u201cheaven and earth\u201d (the\ncosmos) to produce things. By extension, this impulse yields the cycle\nof seasons and the pervasive fecundity of nature. Advocates of this\ndoctrine had found confirmation in the rich, productive Chinese soil\nand temperate climate, which supported their assumption that nature\nwas generally fertile and afforded the right conditions for human\nflourishing. Pervasive, the impulse to produce appears in each and\nevery one of the myriad creatures while in human beings it is refined\ninto the virtue of \u201chumaneness\u201d, which, when fully\nrealized, involves one\u2019s caring attitude and dedicated\nresponsibility toward others. Zhu Xi moreover correlates\n\u201corigination, growth, flourishing and firmness\u201d, the\nfourfold initial stages of creativity and production in the cosmos and\nhuman nature first mentioned in early commentaries on the Book of\nChange, with humaneness, appropriateness, ritual conduct and\nwisdom, the four cardinal virtues enunciated by Confucius. Zhu Xi thus\nportrays the fully cultivated person as at once a complement to heaven\nand earth, a vital participant in cosmic creativity, and a catalyst\nfor the flourishing and self-realization of others. On this basis, he\ngoes on to formulate the definition of ren (humanity,\nhumaneness) for the subsequent tradition: \u201cthe essential\ncharacter of mind\u201d and \u201cthe essential pattern of\nlove\u201d. The virtue of humaneness thus grounds the disposition of\nmind as commiserative and describes the core of moral self-realization\nas love for others (other-directed concern), to be appropriately\nmanifested.\n\nIn the closing argument of the Treatise on Humanity, Zhu Xi\nstresses that while the stillness and activity phases of the emotions\nprovide emotive stage setting for one\u2019s dedicated cultivation,\nrealization, and practice of humaneness, what is crucial is the\nprofound insight that,\n\n\nIf one could but truly practice love and maintain it (italics\nadded), one would possess the well-spring of all virtues and the root\nof all good deeds. (based on Chan 1963, 212\u2013227, edited) \n\n\nUnder this premise, Zhu cites Confucius\u2019 advice to Yan Hui,\n\u201cMaster the self by practicing ritual propriety\u201d\n(Analects XII.1). For Zhu Xi, one masters oneself to rein in\none\u2019s na\u00efve self-centeredness by paying ritual respect to\nothers, which in turn spurs a change in the axis of one\u2019s moral\nconcern to other people, especially those with whom one is related and\ndaily interacts. What is important, then, is the moral-ethical\naxis of one\u2019s motivations. But, how is one to sustain and\nmanifest this humanity consistently in attitude and practice? Zhu Xi\ndoes not appeal to philosophic reflection but recommends mindful\n(jing) daily cultivation and practice, i.e., being calm and\nfocused, respectful in personal life, diligent in conducting affairs,\nand dedicated to upholding interpersonal\n relations.[14]\n Moreover, he considers that the emotions play a fundamental role in\nethical cultivation and performance. After stressing serving\none\u2019s parents with filiality and one\u2019s elder brother with\nfraternal respect, Zhu Xi urges: \u201cBe loving in dealing with all\nthings\u201d, which goes well beyond standard filtered and restrained\n\u201cgraded\u201d Confucian love.\n\nHumaneness is not just a matter of being thoughtful and considerate and paying one\u2019s due respect to others ; Zhu Xi underscores the rigors of conducting oneself sincerely and authentically with humaneness, citing Confucius\u2019 examples of not only ministers who had declined official posts to maintain their\nintegrity but of times when the exemplary person is willing to\nsacrifice his or her own life to fulfill humanity (Analects\n15.8). Nonetheless, the animating spirit of Zhu Xi\u2019s\nTreatise remains: \u201clove people gently and benefit\nthings\u201d, as reflected in Mencius\u2019 four incipient ethical\nimpulses and Confucius\u2019 four cardinal\n virtues.[15]\n4. Natural Philosophy\n4.1 Investigating Things for Natural Knowledge and Action\n\nWhile Shao Yong and Cheng Yi in the Northern Song had introduced and sketched out the\nidea of observation in terms of guanwu (observing things),\nfanguan (reflective perception), and gewu\n(investigating things), Zhu Xi not only discussed the idea of\nobservation but offered a multitude of actual observations of\ncelestial and terrestrial phenomena. In addition, his penchant for\nhierarchy and systemization led modern commentators in the twentieth\ncentury to draw comparisons with Plato, Aristotle, and even Thomas\nAquinas. Around the mid-twentieth century, Joseph Needham vividly\npresented Zhu\u2019s system in terms of process philosophy as bearing\norganismic patterns of conceptualization and distinct parallels with\nscientific thinking:\n\n\nI am prepared to suggest, in view of the fact that the term\nLi always contained the notion of pattern, and that Chu Hsi\nhimself consciously applied it so as to include the most living and\nvital patterns known to man, that something of the idea of\n\u2018organism\u2019 was what was really at the back of the minds of\nthe Neo-Confucians, and that Chu Hsi was therefore further advanced in\ninsight into the nature of the universe than any of his interpreters\nand translators, whether Chinese or European, have yet given him\ncredit for. (Needham 1956a: 474)\n\n\nSoon thereafter, after undertaking a careful study of Zhu\u2019s\ndialogues (Zhuzi yulei), Hu Shih presented Zhu\u2019s method\nof inquiry, gewu zhizhi (investigate things to attain\nknowledge) as essentially a process of \u201chypothesis and\nverification by evidence\u201d (Chan 1989: 566), consistent in spirit\nwith a scientific approach to inquiry. Needham and Hu effectively cast\nZhu\u2019s thought and method in a new light, as more creative,\nscientific, holistic, and practical than previously thought. Since then, many\nhave discussed Zhu as a process thinker, but little has been written\nto consider the extent to which his system could accommodate a\nscientific worldview, and the extent to which his method of inquiry\nwas consistent with a scientific approach. Yung Sik Kim offers an in-depth inquiry into the\nextent to which Zhu Xi anticipated genuine scientific methods of\nobservation and conceptualization in The Natural Philosophy of Chu\nHsi (2000).\n\nZhu from childhood displayed a genuine interest in natural phenomena\nand in raising speculative questions. Later he tended to rein in this\ninterest, for example by relating features of observed natural\nphenomena to human analogues for didactic purposes and by refraining\nfrom pressing his speculations very far, i.e., beyond the scope of\nverifiable knowledge and applicability. Zhu lived during a tumultuous\nperiod in Chinese history when Neo-Confucian scholars tended to draw\nupon the resources of their own tradition to revitalize the empire, an\neffort in which Zhu\u2019s ouvre constituted a watershed. He\nsought to wed the objective and subjective trends of the earlier\nmovement into a practical synthesis in which objective inquiry played\na key role in subjective cultivation. Subsequently, however, as his\ndisciples refined his thought into a scholastic doctrine, subjective\ncultivation began to prevail over objective inquiry, which was increasingly\nredirected into the narrow limits of reading and interpersonal\nconduct.\n\nA Neo-Confucian master of the Ming dynasty, Wang Shouren (Yangming;\n1472\u20131529), spurned Zhu\u2019s method of inquiry altogether\nafter he made a futile attempt to observe the li (patterning) in the\nbamboo outside his gate. Holding that facts are obvious to a\nperceptive observer and do not require endless further investigation, Wang\nwent on to formulate an idealist pragmatism that became influential.\nIntending to counter the scholasticism and careerism of his day, Wang,\na military man, stressed volitionism and activism and spurned the sort\nof careful objective inquiry Zhu thought necessary to making balanced\njudgments and appropriate responses.\n\nZhu conceptualized nature and natural phenomena in terms of\nli (pattern, patterning) and gewu (the investigation\nof things), qi (primal vapor), yin-yang,\nwuxing (five phases), shu (number, probability,\nratio), xiang (images); figures from the Book of\nChanges), ghosts and spirits (gui-shen), heaven and the\nsage (tian-shengren), stimulus-response (ganying),\nand transformation and change (bianhua). In this context, it\nwas important to treat li matter-of-factly as the intrinsic\npatterning of things and events. While the li involved with\nthe identities of things are those facets of intrinsic patterning that\npertain to their basic interactive propensities and functions, the\nli of a concrete thing form \u201ca gestalt totality\u201d\n(Kim 2000), nearly as complex as the thing itself. Thus, whereas\nscholars tend to take Zhu\u2019s assertion that \u201cfor a certain\n(kind of) thing to exist, there first must be that li\u201d\nor \u201cthere must be this li for there to be that (kind\nof) thing\u201d as indicative of a metaphysical principle of\nsufficient reason, in this context li simply affirm that\nthings of identifiable kinds bear identifying patterns (xing)\nthat make them what they are and interact as they do. Li\nindicate reference points for identities of things that influence\ntheir typical patterns of interaction with other things. Li\nthus conceived do not amount to principles of explanation and are more\ninvolved with definition, so references to the li of\nphenomena do not add anything cognitive or\n scientific.[16]\n At times, Zhu did present the idea of investigating things in chapter\n5 of the Great Learning (Daxue) as involving a\nstep-by-step approach, with an eye to discerning ever higher levels of\ncommonality among the myriad li (patterns), aiming at an\nultimate comprehension of the most basic form of pattern,\ntaiji (supreme polarity). Although this approach lacks the\nrigor of a logical categorical system, when viewed together with\nZhu\u2019s comments on Zhou Dunyi\u2019s Diagram of the Supreme\nPolarity (Taiji tu), it is suggestive for viewing\nphenomena and forms in a developmental, almost evolutionary context.\nAs Needham comments:\n\n\nChu Hsi [Zhu Xi] wrote:\n\n\nIf one peers into the mystery, the thai chi [taiji,\nsupreme polarity] seems a chaotic and disorderly wilderness lacking\nall signs of an arranger\u2026, yet the Li (fundamental\npattern) of motion and rest, and of Yin and Yang, is fully contained\nwithin it.\n\n\nInnumerable smaller organisms were also contained within it, and\nindeed composed it. Some of them more highly organized than others. In\nfact, the world was no more undifferentiated for the Neo-Confucians\nthan for modern organic philosophy; it manifested a series of\nintegrative levels of organization, wholes at one level being parts on\nthe next. A clear statement of this conception appears in the ninth\nparagraph of the Thai chi Thu Shuo [Explanation of the\ndiagram of the supreme polarity], which indicated the inapplicability\nof categories outside the level to which they belong. (Needham 1956a:\n466)\n\n\nFor Zhu, investigating things to attain knowledge involves arriving at\na grasp of their constituent li; \u201cknowing\u201d or\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d such phenomena, thus, is a matter of\ngrasping their li. While Zhu often speaks of knowing or\ncomprehending something in terms of the metaphor of seeing it clearly,\nof having a clear discernment of it, which is nothing like rigid\npropositional knowledge, he does recognize several forms or levels of\nknowing, and regards the basic steps of learning in analytical\npropositional terms and the higher levels in more synthetic insight\nterms. That is, one first learns facts about the building blocks of\nthe world and human life, e.g., what things are, what they mean, how\nthey fit together; then, gradually, one gains insights into the\nbroader patterns of relationship and intercourse that comprise the\nworld and human life and that eventually afford sensitive glimpses of\nthe inner root as well as the larger picture. Zhu\u2019s discourses\nare as full of detailed accounts of phenomena as they are of synthetic\ninsights, which should be expected given that Zhu gives equal status\nand value to the various sorts of qualities that the Western tradition\ndivides into primary (quantitative), secondary (qualitative), and\ntertiary (qualitative effects).\n\nAs noted, Zhu drew on notions of qi, yin-yang, the five\nphases, shu (numbers, probablilities), and images as\nconceptual and categorical resources for classifying, characterizing,\nand understanding the world, especially cycles, processes, and\nparticular things and events. Chinese thinkers, especially during the\nHan dynasty, used such notions to arrange categories of reality and\ncompile lists of qualities for each category. While some of the\nassociated qualities are directly or causally linked, many of them are\narbitrary\u2014perhaps assigned in light of long forgotten events or\ndecrees. These sets of categories were compiled as systematic indices\nfor grasping things and events in terms of categorical associations\nand imputations. Inevitably, these sets of categories bore a strongly\ncultural stamp and bias but were applied equally to natural phenomena,\nas if the natural world were an extension of the human world, not\nvice versa.\n\nZhu often classified a natural phenomenon in terms of these categories\nand associations, and left it at that, unconcerned that the categories\nwere haphazard and the associations arbitrary and inexplicable. Likely\nZhu recognized that these categories and associations often were\narbitrary and not particularly informative regarding physical reality\nbut did not find it necessary or practical to pursue the matter. He presumably\ncontented himself with assigning phenomena to these culturally colored\nsets of categories and associations because in those speech contexts\nthose associations were more significant and interesting than the\nprobing of purely physical categories and explanations would have\nbeen. These sorts of examples reflect the cultural common sense and\nconditions of common speech of his age.\n\nThe question arises whether these sets of categories and associations\nwere more a help or a hindrance to the development of science in\ntraditional China. On the one hand, their loose criteria and arbitrary\ndesign allowed for easy classifications and \u201caccounts\u201d of\nphenomena that would have stymied serious scientific investigation\nwhile, on the other, the associations thus attributed to these\nphenomena sometimes might have yielded expectations or hypotheses of\nsorts, thus stimulating further inquiry. Interestingly, Zhu often\nsidestepped these sets of categories altogether in his serious\nthinking about natural phenomena and judged them by what he took to be\nthe deciding factors in the cases themselves, often in light of\nanalogies. Striking cases of this are Zhu\u2019s discussions on the\nstructure of the cosmos (heaven and earth) and insightful explanations\nof phases of the moon and eclipses of the sun and moon. For example,\nZhu often said that the earth was floating on water; both below the\nearth and surrounding its four sides were water, but he also said that\nqi surrounded the earth. And, he also spoke of vortices,\ncentrifugal forces, and occasionally of the earth\u2019s motion. Zhu\nwas interested in these accounts of the formation of the world, but\nsaw no way to confirm any of them. He perhaps thought it was important\nto present such accounts as representative of an objective approach to\na question that was more amenable to mystical or religious\napproaches.\n\nZhu\u2019s notions of stimulus-response and transformation and change\nare noteworthy, for they are counterparts to the concepts of causation\nand change in Western science. Construing phenomena as resonant and sensitive,\nperhaps perceptive in a rudimentary sense, the notion of\nstimulus-response reinforces the interdependence of things. Assuming a\nresonance among things in terms of parallelisms among their forms, and\naffinities among their qi, this notion presents phenomena on\na biological model and conduces to an ecological rather than a\nmechanical outlook. While providing an interactive way of talking\nabout phenomena, it doesn\u2019t open the way or impel the inquirer\nto uncover the nuts and bolts of causation and change. Also, since the\nidea of stimulus-response was usually tied to the aforementioned sets\nof categories and associations, it was often vague and applied in\narbitrary and superstitious ways. As might be expected, Zhu\u2019s\nnotions of transformation and change also reflected biological and\nhuman-life models, with transformation indicating gradual change, as\nin the growth of a child or the passage of summer, and change\nindicating a sudden transformation, as from a caterpillar to a\nbutterfly or from summer to winter and life to death. From the\nstandpoint of developing science, by making change seem to be\nnatural and inevitable, these notions of transformation and change\ntended to make further inquiry appear to be unwarranted. In contrast,\nWestern ideas of eternal substance and inert matter, for example, made the observed\nchanges on the earth and in the skies problematic and in urgent need\nof further inquiry and explanation. More pragmatic in spirit, the\nChinese were concerned mainly with registering and grasping the\nobserved patterns and sequences of change in and around them so as to\nbe able to adapt their lives to the ever-changing circumstances.\n(The Book of Changes was a guide to making such adaptations.)\n\nZhu Xi posits an ontological and causal continuity between the\ncelestial and terrestrial realms, as well as between the animal and\nplant species and humanity. Indeed, there is no categorical difference\nbetween human beings and other life forms. Against this backdrop, Zhu\ncarefully observed anomalies and sketched explanations based on the\ngeneral ideas available to him. For example, when observing fossils of\nseashells atop a mountain, Zhu noted that the area had once been a\nseabed and hypothesized that the earth formerly was softer and more\nfluid and that, through wave motions, this seabed later rose to become\na mountain top. Meanwhile, the entire earth dried as it grew older.\nWhile this explanation was not rigorous or determinate enough to count\nas a scientific hypothesis; Zhu appealed only to naturalistic concepts\nand principles in his comments. Zhu also made quantitative measurements of\nplant growth. Zhu once heard about a monk\u2019s claim that oould see\nevidence of the nourishing powers of \u201cnight vapor\u201d by\nobserving bamboo sprouts, which grow twice as fast at night as during\nthe day. Later, during a stay at a Buddhist residence on Jade\nMountain, Zhu observed that the bamboo sprouts there displayed the\n\u201csame rate of growth day and night, exactly the opposite of the\nmonk\u2019s claim\u201d. Qian Mu observes that Zhu\u2019s practice\nof gewu (investigating things) was fruitful because he made\nobservations with questions or hypotheses in mind, adding that Wang\nShouren\u2019s observations of bamboo had been fruitless and in vain because he\nhad no question or hypothesis in mind to test. Wang was just undertaking\nbland looking (Qian 1986: 215f, 219).\n\nIn contrast to analytical Western concepts used in studying the\nnatural world, including matter, material quality, motion, and change,\nZhu Xi adopted a holistic approach to understanding the physical world\nand phenomena. He drew upon received notions of li (pattern)\nand qi (cosmic vapor) to describe and account for the\nmaterial, dynamic, and formal features of perceived phenomena.\nLi (pattern) refer to the inner patterns of both interaction\nand identifying form. As noted, li are not general\noverarching principles, but inner patternings implicated in things and\nevents, from the discernible textures\u2014grains in wood, veins in\nleaves\u2014to the postulated identifying forms, xing, of\nthings. In terms of dynamic interaction, li structure the\nprimal yin-yang intercourse as taiji, and the\nintercourse among the five phases as their constitutive identifying\nforms. Zhu thus conceived of the cosmos as emerging from incipient\nyin-yang interaction in the initially formless primal\nqi (yuanqi). Yin-yang interaction and\nfurther permutations give rise to the five phases, which bear the full\nrange of material and perceptual qualities and whose interaction gives\nrise to heaven, earth, and the myriad things, i.e., the cosmos.\n\nThe Chinese system of five phases differs from traditional Western\natomism on several counts. As qi (yin-yang) operates\nin essentially a wave-like manner, the world is manifested as a field\nof interacting qi forces. Change is a function of the\nattunement of forms and resonance of qi, and transformation\nis viewed according to chemical and biological models. That is, not\nonly are the five phases derived from yin-yang interaction;\nthey are divisible and inter-convertible. Moreover, while Western\natoms bear only primary qualities in themselves, each of the five\nphases exhibits a range of perceptual qualities and effects, and the\ntradition attributes a plethora of qualities and associations to\nyin and yang. These flexible and adaptable concepts\ndo not create the sorts of problems, the kinds of conflicts with\nobservation, that prompt rethinking and further, more precise\ninvestigations of phenomena. Because perceptual properties of all sorts\nare propagated from the formation of the five phases, Zhu Xi and\nothers in his tradition did not draw the critical distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities that formed a crucial linchpin in\nphysical analysis in the West from antiquity. To be sure, Zhu spoke of\na threshold between perceptible and imperceptible phenomena in terms\nof the expressions \u201cabove forms\u201d (xing er shang)\nand \u201cwithin forms\u201d (xing er xia). \u201cAbove\nforms\u201d refers not to general principles or primary qualities but\nessentially to the immanental moral underpinnings of nature and\nhumanity, i.e., the inner roots of order and harmony, ecologically\nconceived, primary examples of which are dao and li.\nCharacterizing these fundamental notions as \u201cabove forms\u201d,\nZhu insisted that people needed to comprehend them in light of their\nmanifestations in perceived phenomena \u201cwithin forms\u201d.\nLacking the critical distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities, Zhu treated perceptual qualities, such as color and taste,\nas equally basic, innate, and real in material substances as any\nother, and as such he did not look to underlying principles, causes,\nor mechanisms in terms of which to explain these manifest\nqualities.\n\nZhu Xi didn\u2019t feel the need to formulate a theory of motion as\nsuch either, because the factors were glossed in his commonsense grasp\nof the world and he didn\u2019t see any advantage in explicating\nthem. Importantly, he couldn\u2019t conceive of their theoretical\nramifications or especially of their practical implications, such as\nfor engineering and technology. At the same time, Zhu did have a grasp\nof inertia and the relativity of motion, keys to solving the problems\nof motion, but it was not adequate to the task. The capacity to\nimagine ideal cases and relationships would have been necessary: for\nexample, Galileo had to conceive of the paradigmatic case of motion in\nterms of an object moving in a straight line on a frictionless plane\nat a constant velocity, something that can never occur in nature, for\nany actual object inevitably will be environed and influenced by a\nvariety of forces, such as gravity and friction. Essential, too, was\nthe mathematical plotting of motions in nature that approximate the\nparadigmatic motions, such as Kepler\u2019s plotting of planetary\nmotion and Galileo\u2019s plotting of the trajectories of\nprojectiles, to produce precise representations of near-paradigmatic\nmotions. Necessary, too, was an awareness of the possibility of\nmathematical calculation and precise predictions. Zhu\u2019s\nphilosophy involved viewing all things interactively in relative\ncontext. If he had had a notion of paradigmatic (perpetual) motion, it\nwould have been something like wave motions in the sea or the cyclical\npumping action of the traditional Chinese waterwheel used for\nirrigation with rising full troughs of water complemented by the\nfalling empty troughs (receptacles), which he had used to depict the\nyin-yang operation of taiji. Zhu also lacked the\nnecessary notions of precise mathematicization, measurement, and\ncalculation in terms of which to make the theory of motion bear fruit.\nConsequently, it is hardly to be expected that Zhu or any one else in\nhis intellectual circle should have had occasion to formulate anything\nlike a scientific theory of motion.\n\nSeveral features of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought and his notion of\nobservation discouraged him from forming a genuinely scientific theory\nor making scientific observations. Zhu was loath to investigate the\nsorts of fundamental abstract concepts, such as element, compound,\ninfinity, space, time, void, causality, and law, that were necessary\nfor making breakthroughs in the scientific revolution. Because of the\nConfucian commonsense approach to things, Zhu was disinclined to\npursue or investigate such abstract, intangible, and seemingly\nephemeral notions. He tended to think that focusing on concepts like\nvoid, nothingness, infinity, and space would draw people away from the\nworld of human affairs and ultimately incline them toward pointless\nintrospection. Zhu\u2019s concern with the real world itself stymied\nhis investigations into the very abstract concepts necessary for\nconstructing a better grasp of this so-called real world.\n\nZhu Xi had a \u201cparticularistic\u201d tendency to investigate\neach phenomenon on its own terms, without attempting to relate it to\nmore general explanatory principles, as in his treatment of inertia\nand the relativity of motion. In another case, he discussed the\ndifficulty of boiling rice atop a particular mountain in terms of the\ncharacteristics of the qi (cosmic vapor) of that mountain,\nwithout relating the phenomenon generally to characteristics of\nqi (as air pressure) at high altitudes. Inevitably, this\nignoring of general principles made Zhu less sensitive to the\ncontradictions that arose when he offered more than one explanation of\na single phenomenon.\n\nWhy did Zhu Xi go to the trouble of constructing his elaborate system\nand making and discussing all these observations if they didn\u2019t\ncarry him beyond common sense to a deeper and more accurate perception\nand account of reality, to go beyond the details of particular cases\nto more general principles and truths? Zhu\u2019s ultimate purpose\nwas pragmatic rather than epistemic; that is, he was laying out the\nconcepts, framework, and practices that he deemed most conducive to\nself-cultivation, self-realization, and ethical practice, rather than\nformulating objectively accurate concepts, systems, and methods for\nascertaining objective truths about the world. So, he did not have a\npractical interest in pushing his inquiries in purely scientific\ndirections. But, this way of putting it is not completely right\nbecause Zhu had considered a variety of philosophic positions and did\nthink he had selected the best and most accurate of the concepts and\nsystems at his disposal. And, he did attempt to render his ideas in a\nmanner that was faithful to reality, the devotion to which was one of\nhis core cultivation\n themes.[17]\n Clearly, he did not have the requisite concepts, framework, or style\nof thinking through which to conceive the world under overarching\nscientific principles and abstract generalities.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s working concepts and thought were typified by\nimmanental patterns (li) rather than by transcendental\nprinciples. He regarded reality, the world, not in terms of logical\norder, but as manifesting aesthetic order. Reality for him was not\ncomposed of independent atoms operating under general laws; rather it\nformed a field in which particulars appeared as foci determined in\ncontext. To Zhu, ours is not an absolute, objective universe in which\nparticular individuals are subsumed under generalities and behave\naccording to universal laws; rather, the world unfolds before us in\nlight of our increasing, expanding perception of the arrays of\nparticular phenomena around us. The world we experience is a function\nof, a field manifested as, the tapestry formed through the resonance\namong the foci making up that field. Consequently, the task of\ninvestigating things is a process of unfolding (rather than an\ninductive process), an exhausting of the li constituting\nparticular things and events, from their gestalt forms, such as the\nsymmetrical bilateral forms of most biological entities, to their\nidentifying forms to their functions and typical patterns of\ninteraction. Proceeding in this way, we seek not the most general laws\nor principles governing particular atomic individuals, but rather the\nmost basic or common patterns of interaction and formation among\nparticulars as foci in fields. Consequently, for example, the ultimate\npattern in Zhu\u2019s thought, taiji, the supreme polarity,\nis not an abstract ideal like a platonic form or a law of nature; it\nis an immanental pattern that is realized ubiquitously but\ndistributively, not overarchingly or generally. Zhu was not working\ntoward a scientific conception of the world, of reality, as\nconstituted on general principles and abstract equations; he was\ntraversing an alternative route by eliciting the formations of things\nand events in ecological context in a way that would open one\u2019s\nmind to the intimate resonance and intercourse among particulars as foci in fields. At\nthe same time, by stressing the expression \u201cgewu\nqiongli\u201d (investigate things to exhaust their li),\nZhu maintained a measure of analyticity in his insights to ensure that\nthe knowledge people gleaned was nuanced and textured enough to\ncontribute to life understanding and appropriate conduct.\n4.2 Philosophic Synthesis\n\nZhu Xi erected a philosophical synthesis that has been compared\nbroadly to the systems of Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Whitehead,\nand others. These \u201cGreat Chain\u201d systems are hierarchical\nand rooted in the distinction between form and matter. Recent\nimmanental readings of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought have stirred comparisons\nwith Spinoza and even Husserl (Choi 1999; Yeo 2013). Zhu Xi preserved\nthe immanental character of his hierarchy by incorporating Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s conception of world (and self) as shown in the\nDiagram of the Supreme Polarity (Taiji tu), as a way\nto combine the Cheng brothers\u2019 concept of li (pattern)\nwith Zhang Zai\u2019s notion of qi (cosmic vapor) as\norganically integrated in a holistic system. In Zhou\u2019s treatise,\nExplanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity (Taiji\ntu shuo) (Adler 2014), Zhu discerned a viable account of the\nformation of the world in stages from the original unformed\nqi, to yin and yang, the five phases,\nearth, wood, fire, water, and metal, and on to heaven, earth and the\nten thousand things. Zhu blended this conception with ideas from the\nBook of Change and its commentaries in setting forth a\ncomprehensive philosophy of cosmic and human creativity and providing\nphilosophical grounds for the received Confucian concepts of human\nnature and self-cultivation. \n\nZhu Xi\u2019s penchant for thinking in polarities, li and\nqi, in particular, has continued to stir critics to regard\nhim as a dualist who used two fundamental concepts to explain reality.\nFor his part, any viable account of the complexity of phenomena must\ninvolve two or more facets in order to register their complexity,\nvariety, and changes. Zhu generalized the organic understanding of\nli and qi implied in Zhou Dunyi\u2019s\nExplanation under a principle of complementarity, inspired by\nCheng Hao\u2019s observation that all things have their complement\n(discussed in the next section). At first, Zhu thought this principle\nonly governed qi phenomena as patterned by li, but\neventually he admitted that not only were yin and\nyang paradigmatic polar complements but that the supreme\npolarity (taiji) complemented the yin-yang polarity,\nand inferred that li and qi, as the references of\ntaiji and yin-yang, respectively, too had to be\ncomplements. This meant that li and qi were\nfunctionally on a par and mutually implicative. Zhu still felt the\nneed to prioritize li ontologically and ethically, however,\nfor the reason that li underwrites both the possibility of\nqi ordering (to yield a world and phenomena) and the\npossibility of moral feelings and norms (to yield ethics and a system\nof rites). Treating li and qi as full ontological\ncomplements would quite possibly entail a Daoist conception of nature\nas pure spontaneity and ethics as just perspectival while prioritizing\nqi over li would be inadequate for understanding the\nworld and phenomenal orders, and reduce ethics to the received\nnorms.\n5. Complementarity between li and qi, and among related terms\n\nRecognizing li and qi as complements serves to\nunderscore their unity in difference and their implicatedness in not\njust the forms but in the flow of events comprising the\n world.[18]\n This complementary relationship, moreover, underscores the basic\nholism and power of Zhu\u2019s thought regarding the formation of the\nworld and things.\n\nZhu Xi was inspired by Cheng Hao\u2019s formulation of the principle\nof complementarity, which he placed prominently in sec. 1 of the authoritative\nNeo-Confucian anthology, Reflections on Things at Hand (par.\n25):\n\n\nMaster Cheng Hao said: The li of heaven, earth and the myriad\nthings is that nothing exists in isolation; everything certainly has\nits opposite/complement. This is spontaneously so and not artificially\narranged. When I reflect on this truth late at night, I feel delighted\nas if my hands were waving and my feet were dancing. (based on Chan\n1967, edited) \n\nZhu Xi regarded this complementary pattern as describing the most\nfundamental ordering tendency of cosmos, phenomena, and self. Notably,\nthis is li (pattern) in a new sense, now more as a\npattern of creative intercourse than just as inherent\npatterning or order. It generalizes the significance of\ntaiji, though it prima facie lacks\ntaiji\u2019s insistent implication of li into\nqi intercourse and derived phenomena. Zhu remarks that Cheng\nHao felt delighted about his insight into this li\nbecause,\n\n\nOnce he had grasped deeply the truth that, \u201cnothing exists in\nisolation but certainly has its opposite/complement,\u201d it seemed\nto him marvelous and joyous. (based on Chan 1967, edited) \n\n\nZhuzi yulei (Classified Dialogues of Master Zhu),\njuan 95, contains Zhu\u2019s discussions with students on\nthis Cheng Hao quotation. As mentioned, Zhu usually construes this as\na li pattern underlying the complementary relationships among\nqi phenomena, which li itself transcends, hence\nimplying a vertical bifurcation between li and qi.\nWhen a disciple asks Zhu whether the complements have to be\n\u201cthings\u201d or whether, \u201cLi too could have a\ncomplement?\u201d The Master replies,\n\n\nAs to the categories of above and below, small and great, clear and\nturbid, they also pertain to things. But, if we were to say,\n\u201chaving the above, there must be the below; having the large,\nthere must be the small\u201d, that would be purely a matter of\nli, that is to say it has to be like this, as a sort\nof logical necessity. For example, in nature\u2019s production of\nthings, there cannot only be yin, there must also be\nyang; there cannot only be yang, there must also be\nyin. These [yin and yang] are mutual\ncomplements. The contexts of these complements are not themselves\ncomplementary li. Rather, the li are the very reason\nby which there are these complements. (trans. by the author)\n\n\nZhu also applies this li pattern creatively to number,\nspeech, objects, and games. According to this pattern, \u201cOne\ncomplements two\u201d, \u201cabove forms\u201d complements\n\u201cwithin forms\u201d. Any word will bear its semantic complement\nwithin.[19]\nAnd, this object before your eyes has its complements of back, front,\ntop, and bottom. Moreover, each side has its complement\u2026. Any\nsingle thing bears its complement\nwithin.[20]\nFor example, the paths on a checkerboard form series of complementary\npairs. In the end, when only one path remains open and it seems that\nno other complement remains, this very path still complements the 360\nother\n paths.[21] \n This is called a \u2018one-many\ncomplement\u2019, like the \u2018Way-implement complement\u2019\n(Zhuzi yulei, juan 95).\n\nAt the same time, Zhu hesitates to accept that li and\nqi themselves are complementary, but this primarily reflects\nhis ethical\n concerns.[22]\n On the ontological side, he eventually does affirm that li\nand qi are complementary by saying:\n\n\nAs to what would be the complement of taiji, it is said that\ntaiji is wuji (free of polarity)\u2026.\nTaiji also complements yin-yang\u2026. [Regarding]\nthe Way above forms and\u2026 utensil within forms\u2026 these are\n\u2018horizontal oppositions\u2019\u2026. (trans. by the\nauthor)\n\n\nThis is just like,\n\n\nHaving the tranquility of the pre-aroused emotions of pleasure and\nanger, grief and joy, there is the harmony of these emotions when\naroused in due degree. (trans. by the author) \n\n\nTaiji and wuji are opposed, apparently\ncontradictory, expressions. Signifying the most basic complementarity,\nnamely, that between yin and yang, taiji is\nthe most primitive and original form of li. It is\nquintessential li, or elementary form (patterning).\nSignifying something unbounded and free of polarity, wuji\ndescribes the unformed primal qi whence yin and\nyang emerge through the taiji impulse. It is\nquintessential qi, pure potentiality. Hence, Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s proposition, \u201cWuji er taiji\u201d (Free\nfrom polarity, and yet the supreme polarity), expresses the identity\nof opposites (li and qi) that gives rise to the\ninitial impulse of\n phenomena.[23]\n In the next step of this impulse, yin and yang are\nformed. They complement taiji as pure energy to pure form,\nthus expressing another dimension of the li-qi\ncomplementarity.\n\nAlthough the distinction between \u201cabove forms\u201d and\n\u201cwithin forms\u201d does not strictly mark the distinction\nbetween li and qi; nevertheless, as the way is\ncorrelated with li, and implement is embodied qi,\ntheir \u201chorizontal complementarity\u201d implies a\nsimilar pattern for li and qi. Strikingly, whereas\nthose who take this above-below forms distinction as\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d would have to\ndescribe the opposition as \u201cvertical\u201d, Zhu says\nplainly that it is horizontal, thus imputing a closer, more\ninteractive relationship between these complements than could obtain\nhad their relationship been strictly vertical.\n\nA final reason why Zhu Xi\u2019s ideas of li and qi\nought to be taken as horizontal and not vertical complements, that is,\nas a complex unity and not as a metaphysical duality, is found when\nZhu makes two seemingly contradictory claims about li and\nqi: (1) Li is prior to qi. 2) Li\nis not present apart from qi formations. Whereas 1) is\nusually regarded as a positive metaphysical claim, it means rather\nthat li in this sense refers to \u201cpermanent\npossibilities of qi formation\u201d. For example, for any\nparticular qi formation to have come about, it had to have\nbeen possible for the qi constituents to combine in that\nparticular way to yield those properties and\n capacities.[24]\n Whereas (2) is often taken to mean that li subsist until\ninstantiated, it means rather that li are the patterning of\nreal processes and things; they exist immanently in processes and\nthings, though they can be analyzed and discussed separately from\ntheir real contexts. This is why, methodologically, Zhu insists that\nlearners acquaint themselves with the li of things, processes,\naffairs, ethics, etc., by examining actual things, processes,\nphenomena, etc. He regards the study of li in abstraction\nfrom phenomena to be wooden, hollow, empty, etc. Hence, Zhu\u2019s\nclaims (1) and (2) and his methodological strategy all indicate that,\nfor him, the relation of complementarity between li and\nqi is essentially horizontal.\n\nThe \u201cli\u201d pattern in the Cheng Hao quotation thus\nturns out to be a \u201cmeta-li\u201d about the\ndynamic li-qi complements that originate and comprise the\nworld and its constituents, that is, as a second-order abstraction\nfrom the li and qi that are actually implicated in\nphenomena. Again, this meta-li confirms the basic unity and\ndynamism of Zhu\u2019s li-qi system. It reveals the pulse of\nlife at the heart of li and affirms the possibilities of form\nin the vagaries of qi movement. It enlivens Zhu\u2019s\nsystem and makes it flexible and conceptually adaptable to experience\nand thinking.\n\nWe may reflect that Zhu\u2019s original notion of li as\npattern involves restrictions that conflict with experience or\nexpression, so he reconfigures it in light of Zhou Dunyi\u2019s\nExplanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity and the\nCheng Hao\n quotation.[25]\n To work as intended, li has to tolerate and express\nsimultaneous assertions of \u201ccontradictory\u201d complementary\nterms. At the same time, this reconfiguration marks a step away from\nprimarily immanental aesthetic pattern of the li conception\nto a\n more\n abstract, more self-consciously meta-pattern.\n6. Major Interpreters of Zhu Xi\n\nZhu Xi was an active scholar-intellectual who held discussions and\ndisputes with other scholars, both in correspondence and in person.\nHis thought can be understood by contrast with the thought of his\nintellectual rivals as well as through his positive views. For\nexample, his series of letters with Zhang Shi on the topic of\nself-cultivation and moral psychology, preserved in the Collected\nWritings of Master Zhu (Zhuzi wenji), provides an\nilluminating record of these two dedicated Confucians\u2019 quest for\na well-grounded, efficacious approach to self-cultivation. He debated\nwith L\u00fc Zuqian (1134\u20131181) on the nature of education. Zhu\nfocused on the Confucian Way and moral practice in education while Lu\nargued for a broader-based humanities approach. Zhu held a series of\ndebates with Lu Jiuyuan (Xiangshan: 1139\u201393) on the nature of\nrealization and moral conduct. Whereas Zhu advocated regimens of\nstudy, reflection, observation, and practice, Lu spoke simply of\nreflecting on self and clarifying the mind, considering that once the\nmind was clear one would know spontaneously what to do in any\nsituation. Zhu also corresponded with the \u201cutilitarian\u201d\nConfucian scholar Chen Liang (1143\u201394), who disputed Zhu\u2019s\nfocus on individual moral realization and the received\n\u201cWay\u201d with a broader institutional approach that was more\nsensitive to empirical facts and conditions. Zhu generally eclipsed\nall of the other scholars of his day, partly because he outlived them\nand had so many students but mainly because his system was so\ncompelling. It was comprehensive yet nuanced, tightly reasoned yet\naccommodating of individual differences. It preserved the essential\nConfucian Way, yet ramified it to meet the challenges of Buddhism and\nDaoism as spiritual teachings. Zhu\u2019s influence rose at the end\nof the Southern Song dynasty and became decisive during the Yuan\ndynasty when his edition of the Four Books was adopted as the\nbasis of the imperial examination system arranged by scholars trained\nin his approach.\n\nWhile raising his standing in pedagogy, this focus on the Four\nBooks came at the expense of Zhu\u2019s deeper, more nuanced\ntexts and dialogues, and opened the door to undue philosophic\ncriticism. The schematic presentation of Zhu\u2019s broad theory of\nli pattern and qi cosmic vapor that lay in the\nbackground of his commentary to the Four Books easily opened\nhim to charges of dualism and of reading abstract categories into the\ndown to earth, essentially practical ancient texts. Because his\ncommentary was focused on reading and understanding the meaning,\nintent, and cultivation message of the Four Books, critics\ngeneralized that Zhu and his method were essentially scholastic and\nwould be myopic and stilted in facing real situations. Anyone who\nperuses the corpus of Zhu\u2019s writings and dialogues, however,\nwill find that his ontology is not a crude dualism but a holism built\nof complementary, mutually implicative elements that never exist in\nseparation. Also, his reflections are always informed by knowledge of\nhistory, current events, practical observation, and personal\nreflection, as his method of observation applies generally to objects\n(and self) and phenomena while respecting texts, which he took to be\nhandbooks of ethical insight and practice, after all. Even Zhu\u2019s\ncomments on Confucius and Mencius often refer back to the person and\nthe speech context, and thus are not entirely scholastic. His method\nof observation opened the door to breakthroughs beyond the\n\u201cverities\u201d of the classics, though he was careful not to\nplay up this fact because most of his intellectual colleagues\nprimarily sought the truth in the texts, thinking empirical facts were\ndistractions from the essential Natural-patterning (tianli)\nthat was reflected most adequately in the canonical texts.\n\nWhereas early generations of Zhu\u2019s followers were acquainted\nwith his broad learning, incisive style, and open spirit, Confucians\nof the Ming and Qing dynasties knew him mostly through his edition of\nthe Four Books, through which they targeted their criticisms\nof his thought. Zhu\u2019s most eminent critic was the Ming\nscholar-official Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529). He rejected\nZhu\u2019s approach to observation as too objective and open-ended,\nas outward and diffuse and neglectful of concentration and inwardness. It could\nbe said that, in his criticisms, Wang was reacting more to the\nscholastic attitudes fostered by the examination system than to Zhu Xi\nhimself. Wang ultimately respected Zhu and went on to compile a text\nin which he argued that, in later life, Zhu\u2019s thought had taken a \na subjective, practical turn that anticipated Wang\u2019s\napproach.\n\nScholars of the late Ming through the early Qing period\n(mid-seventeenth to early eighteenth century), notably, Wang Fuzhi\n(1619\u201392) and Dai Zhen (Tai Chen, 1723\u201377), disputed Zhu\non philosophical and textual grounds. Whereas Zhu had allegedly insisted on the\npriority of \u201cpattern\u201d over qi, (roughly, form\nover matter), Wang and Dai followed the Northern Song thinker Zhang\nZai in affirming the priority of qi, viewing patterns as\na posteriori evolutionary realizations of qi\ninteractions. They thought this account dissolved the threat of any\nhint of dualism in cosmology, ontology, and human nature. For his\npart, Zhu Xi would have responded that, fundamentally,\n\u201cpattern\u201d is implicated in the very make-up and possible\nconfigurations of qi, which is why the regular a\nposteriori patterns can emerge. Li\n\u201cpatterning\u201d provides for the standing orders and\nprocesses, based on the steady interactions of yin-yang, five\nphases, etc., that give rise to the heaven-earth world order, with its\nfull complement of ten thousand things. The fundamental a\npriori patterns are necessary to the world order and provide the\nfecund context in which the a posteriori forms emerge\ncontinuously. Wang and Dai\u2019s qi-based view could not\naccount for existence and the variegated yet systematic given world\norder in this sense. At the same time, Zhu did not think that\n\u201cpatterns\u201d were absolutely determinative. They just set\ncertain \u201cpossibilities of order\u201d that are realized when\nthe necessary qi conditions obtained. For the most part, he\nregistered the range of randomness and free flow in qi\nactivity that is best exemplified in the randomness of weather systems\nand seismic events.\n\nAs to textual grounds, Wang and Dai argued that Zhu was so enamored of\nhis metaphysics of pattern and qi that he constantly read\nthem into the classical texts. For example, Dai said Zhu blandly\nassociated Confucius\u2019 term tian (heaven) with his own\nnotion of li (pattern), quoting Analects 11:9 where\nConfucius, in sorrow over the death of his disciple Yan Hui, cried\nthat \u201cHeaven has forsaken me\u201d. Da questioned how Zhu Xi could \nreasonably claim that Confucius was crying that li had\nforsaken him? Critics tend to find this counter-intuitive\nexample of Dai\u2019s against Zhu\u2019s approach to be compelling. However,\nconsulting Zhu\u2019s original commentary, we find that he noted that\nthis phrase was not literally about heaven but rather expressed\nConfucius\u2019 utmost sorrow, that Confucius felt Yan Hui\u2019s\ndeath as if it was his own son\u2019s, without mentioning\n\u201cpattern\u201d. This example does not support Wang and\nDai\u2019s claim in the least. It illustrates that Zhu\u2019s\ncommentary was nuanced and sensitive to pragmatic, situational usages\ndespite his penchant to see his own notion of \u201cpattern\u201d in\nsome of Confucius\u2019 usages of \u201cheaven\u201d. Moreover, as\nthe intellectual historian Daniel Gardner shows, Zhu\u2019s\ncommentary was not intended as simply a glossary with comments. It was\nintended as a guide to self-cultivation. Hence, Zhu sometimes recast\npassages in the Analects more generally to show their broader\nimplications for self-cultivation and realization, often with the\nisolated countryside student in mind. Gardner shows how Zhu had\neffectively enriched the text as a tool for self-cultivation whereas\nearlier commentaries of the Han and Tang dynasties had just given\nglosses necessary for answering examination questions.\n\nKnown in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the West through\nthe work of Jesuits in China, Zhu Xi\u2019s thought and texts were\nmade more widely available to western scholarship in the late\nnineteenth century. Notably, James Legge (1815\u20131897) based his\ntranslations of the Chinese Classics on Zhu Xi\u2019s commentaries,\nwhich he quoted and discussed at length in his footnotes to the texts. Early in\nthe twentieth century, a Chinese student of John Dewey\n(1859\u20131951) at Cornell, Hu Shi (1891\u20131962), initially\nfollowed the empirical, textual Qing scholars in viewing Zhu as a\nscholastic metaphysician. But, after reading Zhu\u2019s\nDialogues for himself in old age, Hu contended that Zhu\u2019s method of\nobservation was not scholastic but essentially scientific in nature.\nJ.P. Bruce, who translated a book of Zhu\u2019s collected writings in\nthe 1920s, viewed Zhu\u2019s notion of li (pattern;\nprinciple) in light of Stoic natural law. From the 1930s, the eminent\nhistorian of Chinese philosophy, Feng Youlan, interpreted li\nalong the lines of platonic Forms making Zhu Xi appear to be an\nidealist and abstract thinker. In the 1950s, Carsun Chang naturalized\nthe notion of li by aligning it with the Aristotelian\n\u201cnature\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d, thereby locking\nZhu\u2019s thought into a sort of rigid descriptive metaphysics.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Mou Zongsan interpreted and criticized Zhu\u2019s\nontology and ethics on Kantian grounds, claiming Zhu had erected an\na priori framework but then illicitly sought to derive\nfurther a priori knowledge (of patterns) by a\nposteriori means (observation). In the 1970s, the intellectual\nhistorian, Qian Mu examined and explained Zhu Xi\u2019s thought\ndirectly in traditional indigenous terms, without reading western\nconcepts and logical patterns into his system. Scholars wanting to\nread Zhu Xi on his own terms, largely unmediated by western thought,\nturn to the five volume Zhu Xi anthology edited by Qian Mu as a rich\nstarting point.\n\nIn 1956, Joseph Needham, a chemist, made a significant breakthrough by\ninterpreting Zhu\u2019s system in terms of a process philosophy,\nWhitehead\u2019s organic naturalism. Needham successfully recast much\nof Zhu\u2019s language in naturalistic rather than metaphysical\nterms. The cultural, moral dimension of Needham\u2019s account has\nbeen developed by Cheng-ying Cheng and John Berthrong while the\nscientific dimension has been examined by Yung Sik Kim. In the 1980s,\nA.C. Graham offered the most insightful and apt account of Zhu\u2019s\nterminology and pattern of thought in, \u201cWhat Was New in the\nCh\u2019eng-Chu Theory of Human Nature?\u201d and other writings.\nGraham showed decisively that the term li refers to an\nembedded contextual \u201cpattern\u201d, rather than to any sort of\nabstract form or principle. He reminded us that the term li\nnever figures in propositions or logical sequences, as would be\nnatural for \u201cprinciple\u201d. Rather, li are always\nconceived as structuring, balancing, modulating, guiding phenomena,\nprocesses, reflection and human discernment and response. For example,\none never finds moral syllogisms in Zhu Xi\u2019s writings. Many of\nZhu\u2019s discussions thus concern moral emotional intelligence:\nattunement, sensitivity, discernment, and response. Joseph Adler views\nli as indicative of an \u201cordering\u201d tendency that\nmay be manifested as \u201cpattern\u201d or as\n\u201cprinciple\u201d in differing contexts. (We might say that\npeople devise principles in the light of observed patterns.) Adler\nalso examines the key roles played by the Book of Change and\nZhou Dunyi in the formation of Zhu\u2019s thought, and joins Thomas\nWilson and Hoyt Tillman in showing the extent to which Zhu Xi\nre-visioned, revised, and recast the Confucian Way. Adler shows how\nZhu Xi made Zhou Dunyi a pivotal figure in the succession of the\nConfucian Way while Wilson is interested in Zhu\u2019s account of the\nWay as a sort of educational-ideological revision, and Tillman is\ninterested in how Zhu\u2019s account of the Way eventually outlasted\nother competing versions that might have offered more practical and\nliberal openings in late imperial China.\n\nAdvances continue to be made in Zhu Xi studies in the present century.\nOn the one hand, intellectual historians, such as Yingshi Yu, examine\nZhu Xi\u2019s historical, political, and cultural backgrounds, as well as\nhis intellectual milieu. Other intellectual historians, such as Hoyt\nTilman and Hans van Ess study Zhu Xi\u2019s intellectual collaborators and\nrivals.  Still others, such as Chun-chieh Huang and his colleagues\nexamine the differing receptions and adaptations of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought by\nConfucian scholars around East Asia. On the other hand, philosophical\ninterpreter Brook Ziporyn has developed a \u201ccoherence\u201d reading of\nli (pattern). Drawing on the parallel model of li\nand shi in Huayan Buddhism, he views Zhu Xi\u2019s li as\nthe organizing, cohering element in qi phenomena, writ large and small.\nGiven the intimate connection between li and truth in Zhu\nXi\u2019s thought, the coherence account of li recalls the\ncoherence theory of truth in 20th century Western philosophy. While\n\u201ccoherence\u201d is an apt and suggestive account of the organizing and\ncohering function of li, it cannot serve as a direct\ntranslation of the term li. Ethicists, such as Stephen Angle, Yong\nHuang, and Justin Tiwald examine Confucian ethics in general and Zhu\nXi\u2019s ethics in particular as species of virtue ethics, as conceived in\nrecent Anglo-American ethical thought. They have identified overlaps\nand similarities between these ethical approaches. Other scholars,\nsuch as Ming-huei Lee and the present author have identified Kantian\nelements in Zhu Xi\u2019s efforts to justify Confucian ethics and\ncultivation. Finally, Shui Chuen Lee and others find support in Zhu\nXi\u2019s system of thought for a viable Confucian approach to\nenvironmental ethics.\n\nIn summary, the depth and range of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought were\nunparalleled in the Chinese intellectual tradition and around East\nAsia. Zhu Xi studies globally continue to be vital, wide-ranging, and\ncontentious, and continue to attract increasing interest around the world.\n",
