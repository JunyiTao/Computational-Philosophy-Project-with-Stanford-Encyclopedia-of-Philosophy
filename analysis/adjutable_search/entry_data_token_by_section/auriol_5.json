    "main_text": "The Character of Auriol\u2019s Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions || Predestination and Free Will\n2.4 Predestination and Free Will\n\nIn the related area of predestination, human free will is again a\nmotive force behind Auriol\u2019s ideas. Believing that earlier\nexplanations of the way God elected some to salvation and damned\nothers to eternal punishment left all too little room for human free\nwill, Auriol proposed a theory on which God offers his grace freely to\nall human beings. Salvation comes to those who passively accept this\nfree offer of grace. Those whom God knows offer an obstacle to grace,\ni.e. those who actively reject it, God damns to eternal punishment.\nThus, for Auriol, the central issue in predestination is how human\nbeings choose to react to God\u2019s free offer of grace: they are\njudged on their reaction. Auriol believes that he has avoided any hint\nof Pelagianism \u2014 where human beings can merit salvation on their\nown account \u2014 because individuals do not do anything\nactively in order to earn their salvation on his theory; they are only\nrequired to passively accept grace by not offering an obstacle to it,\nand this passive acceptance is, according to Auriol, a negative cause\nof the person\u2019s salvation. Auriol\u2019s theory when first\nproposed was an extremely innovative way of explaining the mechanics\nof salvation, and it came in for scathing criticism from, among\nothers, Gregory of Rimini; but, whether through direct influence or\nnot, elements of Auriol\u2019s theory appear in the works of such\nthinkers as William Ockham, Robert Holcot, and, on the eve of the\nReformation, Gabriel Biel (Halverson 1998).\n\nIn the rest of this entry, we\u2019ll look at two areas in which\nAuriol provoked a significant response in part on account of his\nradical solutions, two areas that also illustrate the systematic and\nhistorical nature of his thought: his ideas on the relation between\ncognition and reality (including his conceptualism) and his ideas on\nintuitive and abstractive cognition.\n",
