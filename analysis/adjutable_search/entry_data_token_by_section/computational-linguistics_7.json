But views diverge concerning how literally or non-literally this\ntenet should be understood. The most literal understanding, which we\nwill term the logicist view,\nis the one that regards language\nitself as a logical meaning representation with a compositional,\nindexical semantics\u2014at least when we have added brackets as\ndetermined by parse trees, and perhaps certain other augmentation\n(variables, lambda-operators, etc.)\nIn itself, such a view makes no commitments about mental\nrepresentations, but application of Occam's razor and the presumed\nco-evolution of thought and language then suggest that mentalese is\nitself language-like. The common objection that \u201chuman thinking is not\nlogical\u201d carries no weight with logicists, because logical meaning\nrepresentations by no means preclude nondeductive modes of inference\n(induction, abduction, etc.);\nnor are logicists impressed by the objection that people quickly forget\nthe exact wording of verbally conveyed information, because both\ncanonicalization of inputs and systematic discarding of all but major\nentailments can account for such forgetting. Also assumption of a\nlanguage-like,\nlogical mentalese certainly does not preclude other modes of\nrepresentation and thought, such as imagistic ones, and synergistic\ninteraction with such modes (Paivio 1986; Johnston & Williams 2009).\nRelating language to logic\n\nSince Richard Montague (see especially Montague 1970, 1973) deserves\nmuch of the credit for demonstrating that language can be logically\nconstrued, let us reconsider the sentence structure in figure 1 and\nthe corresponding grammar rules and vocabulary, but this time\nsuppressing features, and instead indicating how logical\ninterpretations expressed in (a variant of) Montague's type-theoretic\nintensional logic can be obtained compositionally. We slightly\n\u201ctwist\u201d Montague's type system so that the possible-world\nargument always comes last, rather than first, in the denotation of a\nsymbol or expression.  For example, a two-place predicate will be of\ntype (e \u2192 (e \u2192 (s \u2192 t)))\n(successively applying to an entity, another entity, and finally a\npossible world to yield a truth value), rather than Montague's type\n(s \u2192 (e \u2192 (e \u2192 t))), where\nthe world argument is first. This dispenses with numerous applications\nof Montague's intension (\u2227) and extension\n(\u2228) operators, and also slightly simplifies truth\nconditions. For simplicity we are also ignoring contextual indices\nhere, and treating nouns and VPs as true or false of individuals,\nrather than individual concepts (as employed by Montague to account\nfor such sentences as \u201cThe temperature is 90 and rising\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nS\n\u2192\n NP VP; \n   S\u2032 \n=\n\nNP\u2032(VP\u2032)\n\n\nVP\n\u2192\nV NP; \nVP\u2032\n=\n (\u03bbx NP\u2032(\u03bby\nV\u2032(y)(x)))\n\n\nNP \n\u2192\n Det N; \nNP\u2032 \n=\n Det\u2032(N\u2032)\n\n\nNP \n\u2192\n Name; \n NP\u2032 \n=\n Name\u2032\n\n\n\n\nHere primed constituents represent the intensional logic translations\nof the corresponding constituents. (Or we can think of them as\nmetalinguistic expressions standing for the set-theoretic denotations\nof the corresponding constituents.) Several points should be noted.\nFirst, each phrase structure rule is accompanied by a unique semantic\nrule (articulated as the rule-to-rule\nhypothesis by Emmon Bach (1976)),\nwhere the denotation of each phrase is fully determined by the\ndenotations of its immediate\nconstituents: the semantics is\ncompositional. \n\nSecond, in the S\u2032-rule, the subject is assumed to be a second-order\npredicate that is applied to the denotation of the VP (a monadic\npredicate) to yield a sentence intension, whereas we would ordinarily\nthink of the subject-predicate semantics as being the other way\naround, with the VP-denotation being applied to the subject. But\nMontague's contention was that his treatment was the proper one,\nbecause it allows all types of subjects\u2014pronouns, names, and\nquantified NPs\u2014to be handled uniformly. In other words, an NP\nalways denotes a second-order property, or (roughly speaking) a set of\nfirst-order properties (see also Lewis 1970). So for example,\nThetis denotes the set of all properties that Thetis (a\ncertain contextually determined individual with that name) has; (more\nexactly, in the present formulation Thetis denotes a function\nfrom properties to sentence intensions, where the intension obtained\nfor a particular property yields truth in worlds where the entity\nreferred to has that property); some woman denotes the union\nof all properties possessed by at least one woman; and\nevery woman denotes the set of properties shared by all\nwomen.  Accordingly, the S\u2032-rule yields a sentence intension that is\ntrue at a given world just in case the second-order property denoted\nby the subject maps the property denoted by the VP to such a\ntruth-yielding intension.\nThird, in the VP\u2032-rule, variables x and y\nare assumed to be of type e (they take basic individuals as\nvalues), and the denotation of a transitive verb should be thought of\nas a function that is applied first to the object, and then to the\nsubject (yielding a function from worlds to truth values\u2014a sentence\nintension). The lambda-abstractions in the VP\u2032-rule can be\nunderstood as ensuring that the object NP, which like any NP denotes a\nsecond-order property, is correctly applied to an ordinary property\n(that of being the love-object of a certain x), and the\nresult is a predicate with respect to the (still open) subject\nposition. The following is an interpreted sample vocabulary:\n\n\n\nV\n\u2192\nloves;\n  V\u2032 \n=\nloves\n\n Det \n\u2192\n a;\n     \n    Det\u2032 \n=\n  \u03bbP \u03bbQ(\u2203x[P(x) \u2227\nQ(x)])\n\n (For comparison:\n\nDet\n \u2192\n every;\n\nDet\u2032\n =\n \u03bbP\n\u03bbQ(\u2200x[P(x) \u2283 Q(x)])\n\nN\n\u2192\n mortal;\n\n         N\u2032 \n=\n mortal\n\nName\n\u2192\n Thetis;\n   \nName\u2032 \n=\n\u03bbP(P(Thetis))\n\n\n\nNote the interpretation of the indefinite determiner\n(on line 2)\nas a generalized quantifier\u2014in effect\na second-order predicate over two ordinary properties, where these\nproperties have intersecting truth domains. We could have used an\natomic symbol for this second-order predicate, but the above way of\nexpanding it shows the relation of the generalized quantifier to the\nordinary existential quantifier. Though it is a fairly self-evident\nmatter, we will indicate in section 4.1 how the sentence \n\u201cThetis loves a mortal\u201d yields the following representation after some\nlambda-conversions:\n\n      (\u2203x [mortal(x) \u2227\nloves(x)(Thetis)]).\n\n(The English sentence also has a generic or habitual reading,\n\u201cThetis loves mortals in general\u201d, which we ignore here.) This\ninterpretation has rather a classical look to it, but only because of\nthe reduction from generalized to ordinary quantifiers that we have\nbuilt into the lexical semantics of the indefinite a in the\nabove rules, instead of using an atomic symbol for it. Montague was\nparticularly interested in dealing satisfactorily with intensional\nlocutions, such as \n\u201cJohn seeks a unicorn.\u201d This does not\nrequire the existence of a unicorn for its truth\u2014John has a certain\nrelation to the unicorn-property, rather than to an existing\nunicorn. Montague therefore treated all predicate arguments as\nintensions; i.e., he rendered \n\u201cJohn seeks a unicorn\u201d\nas\n seeks(\u03bbQ\n\u2203x[unicorn(\u2227x)\n\u2227 Q(\u2227x)]) (\u2227john),\n\nwhich can be reduced to a version where unicorn is extensionalized to\nunicorn*:\n seeks(\u03bbQ\n\u2203x[unicorn*(x)\n\u2227 Q(\u2227x)]) (\u2227john).\n\nBut ultimately Montague's treatment of NPs, though it was in a sense\nthe centerpiece of his proposed conception of language-as-logic, was\nnot widely adopted in computational linguistics. This was in part\nbecause the latter community was not convinced that an omega-order\nlogic was needed for NL semantics, found the somewhat complex treatment\nof NPs in various argument positions and in particular, the treatment\nof scope ambiguities in terms of multiple syntactic analyses, \nunattractive, and was preoccupied with other semantic issues, such as\nadequately representing events and their relationships, and developing\nsystematic nominal and verb \u201contologies\u201d for broad-coverage NL\nanalysis. Nonetheless, the construal of language as logic left a strong\nimprint on computational semantics, generally steering the field\ntowards compositional approaches, and in some approaches such as CCG,\nproviding a basis for a syntax tightly coupled to a type-theoretic\nsemantics (Bach et al. 1987;\nCarpenter 1997).\nAn alternative to Montague's syntax-based approach to quantifier scope\nambiguity is to regard NPs of form Det+N (or strictly, Det+N-bar) as\ninitially unscoped higher-order predicates in an underspecified logical\nform, to be subsequently \u201craised\u201d so as to apply to a first-order\npredicate obtained by lambda-abstraction of the vacated term position.\nFor example, in the sentence \n\u201cEveryone knows a poem\u201d, with the object\nexistentially interpreted, we would have the underspecified LF\n\nknows\u27e8a(poem)\u27e9\u27e8every(person)\u27e9\n\n (without reducing\ndeterminers to classical quantifiers) and we can now \u201craise\u201d\n\u27e8a(poem)\u27e9 to yield\n\na(poem)(\u03bby\nknows(y)\u27e8every(person)\u27e9, \n\nand then \u201craise\u201d\n\u27e8every(person)\u27e9 to yield either\n\na(poem)(\u03bby\nevery(person)(\u03bbx knows(y)(x))),\n\n or\n\nevery(person)(\u03bbx\na(poem)(\u03bby knows(y)(x))).\n\n Thus we obtain a reading according to which there is a poem that\neveryone knows, and another according to which everyone knows some\npoem (not necessarily the same one). (More on scope disambiguation\nwill follow in section 4). A systematic version\nof this approach, known as Cooper storage (see Barwise & Cooper\n1981) represents the meaning of phrases in two parts, namely a\nsequence of NP-interpretations (as higher-order predicates) and the\nlogical matrix from which the NP-interpretations were extracted.\nBut one can also take a more conventional approach, where first of\nall, the use of \u201ccurried\u201d (Sch\u00f6nfinkel-Church-Curry)\nfunctions in the semantics of predication is avoided in favor of\nrelational interpretations, using lexical semantic formulas such\nas loves\u2032 =\n\u03bby\u03bbx(loves(x, y)), and\nsecond, unscoped NP-interpretations are viewed as unscoped restricted\nquantifiers (Schubert & Pelletier 1982). Thus the unscoped LF\nabove would be knows(\u27e8\u2203poem\u27e9,\n\u27e8\u2200person\u27e9), and scoping of quantifiers, along with\ntheir restrictors, now involves \u201craising\u201d quantifiers to\ntake scope over a sentential formula, with simultaneous introduction\nof variables. The two results corresponding to the two alternative\nscopings are then\n (\u2203y: poem(y))(\u2200x:\nperson(x))knows(x, y), \n\nand\n\n(\u2200x:\nperson(x))(\u2203y: poem(y))knows(x, y). \n\nWhile this strategy departs\nfrom the strict compositionality of Montague Grammar, it achieves\nresults that are often satisfactory for the intended purposes and does\nso with minimal computational fuss. A related approach to logical form\nand scope ambiguity enjoying some current popularity is minimal\nrecursion semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al.\n2005), which goes even further in fragmenting the meaningful parts of\nan expression, with the goal of allowing incremental constraint-based\nassembly of these pieces into unambiguous sentential LFs. Another\ninteresting development is an approach based on\ncontinuations, a notion taken\nfrom programming language theory (where a\ncontinuation is a program execution state as determined by the steps\nstill to be executed after the current instruction). This also allows\nfor a uniform account of the meaning of quantifiers, and  provides\na handle on such phenomena as \u201cmisplaced modifiers\u201d, as in \n\u201cHe had a quick cup of coffee\u201d (Barker 2004).\nAn important innovation in logical semantics was discourse\nrepresentation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981; Heim 1982), aimed at a\nsystematic account of anaphora. In part, the goal was to provide a\nsemantic explanation for (in)accessibility of NPs as referents of\nanaphoric pronouns, e.g., in contrasting examples such as \u201cJohn\ndoesn't drive a car; *he owns it,\u201d vs.  \u201cJohn drives a\ncar; he owns it\u201d. More importantly, the goal was to account for\nthe puzzling semantics of sentences involving donkey anaphora, e.g.,\n\n\u201cIf John owns a donkey, he beats it.\u201d Not only is the\nNP a donkey, the object of the if-clause, accessible as\nreferent of the anaphoric it, contrary to traditional\nsyntactic binding theory (based on the notion of C-command), but\nfurthermore we seem to obtain an interpretation of the type\n\u201cJohn beats every donkey that he owns\u201d, which cannot be\nobtained by \u201craising\u201d the embedded indefinite a\ndonkey to take scope over the entire sentence. There is also a\nweaker reading of the type, \u201cIf John owns a donkey, he beats a\ndonkey that he owns\u201d, and this reading also is not obtainable\nvia any scope analysis. Kamp and Heim proposed a dynamic process of\nsentence interpretation in which a discourse representation structure\n(DRS) is built up incrementally. A DRS consists of a set\nof discourse referents (variables) and a set of\nconditions, where these\nconditions may be simple predications or\nequations over discourse referents, or certain logical combinations of\nDRS's (not of conditions). The DRS for the sentence under consideration\ncan be written linearly as\n [: [x, y: john(x),\ndonkey(y)] \u21d2 [u, v:\nhe(u), it(v),\nbeats(u, v), u=x, v=y]]\n\n\nor diagrammed as\n\n \nFigure 2: DRS for \u201cIf John owns a donkey, he beats it\u201d\n\nHere x, y, u, v are discourse referents introduced\nby John, a donkey, he, and it, and the\nequations u=x, v=y represent the result of reference\nresolution for he and it. Discourse referents in the\nantecedent of a conditional are accessible in the consequent, and\ndiscourse referents in embedding DRSs are accessible in the embedded\nDRSs. Semantically, the most important idea is that discourse\nreferents are evaluated dynamically. We think of a variable assignment\nas a state, and this state changes as we evaluate a DRS\noutside-to-inside, left-to-right. For example (simplifying a bit), the\nconditional DRS in figure 4 is true (in a given model) if every\nassignment with domain {x,\ny} that makes the antecedent true can be extended to an\nassignment (new state) with domain\n{x, y, u, v} that makes the consequent\ntrue.\nOn the face of it, DRT is noncompositional (though DRS construction\nrules are systematically associated with phrase structure rules); but\nit can be recast in compositional form, still of course with a dynamic\nsemantics. A closely related approach, dynamic predicate\nlogic (DPL) retains the classical quantificational\nsyntax, but in effect treats existential quantification as\nnondeterministic assignment, and provides an overtly compositional\nalternative to DRT (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1991). Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the impact of DRT on practical computational linguistics\nhas been quite limited, though it certainly has been and continues to\nbe actively employed in various projects. One reason may be that\ndonkey anaphora rarely occurs in the text corpora most intensively\ninvestigated by computational linguists so far (though it is arguably\npervasive  and extremely important in generic sentences and\ngeneric passages, including those found in lexicons or sources such as\nCommon Sense Open Mind\u2014see sections\n 4.3 and 8.3).  Another reason\nis that reference resolution for non-donkey pronouns (and definite\nNPs) is readily handled by techniques such as Skolemization of\nexistentials, so that subsequently occurring anaphors can be\nidentified with the Skolem constants introduced earlier.  Indeed, it\nturns out that both explicit and implicit variants of Skolemization,\nincluding functional Skolemization, are possible even for donkey\nanaphora (e.g., in sentences such as \u201cIf every man has a gun, many\nwill use it\u201d\u2014see Schubert 2007). Finally, another reason for\nthe limited impact of DRT and other dynamic semantic theories may be\nprecisely that they are dynamic: The evaluation of a formula in\ngeneral requires its preceding and embedding context, and this\ninterferes with the kind of knowledge modularity (the ability to use\nany given knowledge item in a variety of different contexts) desirable\nfor inference purposes. Here it should be noted that straightforward\ntranslation procedures from DRT, DPL, and other dynamic theories to\nstatic logics exist (e.g., to FOL, for nonintensional versions of the\ndynamic approaches), but if such a conversion is desirable for\npractical purposes, then the question arises whether starting with a\ndynamic representation is at all advantageous.\nThematic roles and (neo-)Davidsonian representations\n\nA long-standing issue in linguistic semantics has been the theoretical\nstatus of thematic roles in the  argument structure of verbs and\nother argument-taking elements of language (e.g., Dowty 1991). The\nsyntactically marked cases found in many languages correspond\nintuitively to such thematic roles as agent,\ntheme, patient, instrument,\nrecipient, goal, and so on, and in English, too, the sentence\nsubject\nand object typically correspond respectively to the agent and theme or\npatient of an action, and other roles may be added as an indirect\nobject or more often as prepositional phrase complements and adjuncts.\nTo give formal expression to these intuitions, many computational\nlinguists decompose verbal (and other) predicates derived from language\ninto a core predicate augmented with explicit binary relations\nrepresenting thematic roles. For example, the sentence\n\n(3.1)John kicked the ball to the fence\n\nmight be represented (after referent determination) as\n\u2203e(kick(e) \u2227 before(e,\nNow1) \u2227 agent(e, John)\n\u2227 theme(e, Ball2) \u2227 goal-loc(e, Fence3)),\n\nwhere e is thought of as the kicking event. Such a\nrepresentation is called neo-Davidsonian, acknowledging\nDonald Davidson's advocacy of the view that verbs tacitly introduce\nexistentially quantified events (Davidson 1967a). The prefix\nneo- indicates that all arguments and adjuncts are\nrepresented in terms of thematic roles, which was not  part of\nDavidson's proposal but is developed, for example, in (Parsons\n1990). (Parsons attributes the idea of thematic roles to the 4th\ncentury BCE Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini.) One\nadvantage of this style of representation is that it absolves the\nwriter of the interpretive rules from the vexing task of\ndistinguishing verb complements, to be incorporated into the argument\nstructure of the verb, from adjuncts, to be used to add modifying\ninformation. For example, it is unclear in (3.1) whether to the\nfence should be treated as supplying an argument of\nkick, or whether it merely modifies the action of John\nkicking the ball. Perhaps most linguists would judge the latter answer\nto be correct (because an object can be kicked without the intent of\npropelling it to a goal location), but intuitions are apt to be\nambivalent for at least one of a set of verbs such as dribble,\nkick, maneuver, move and transport.\nHowever, thematic roles also introduce new difficulties. As pointed out\nby Dowty (1991), thematic\nroles lack well-defined semantics. For\nexample, while (3.1) clearly involves an animate agent acting causally\nupon a physical object, and the PP evidently supplies a goal location,\nit is much less clear what the roles should be in (web-derived)\nsentences such as (3.2\u20133.4), and what semantic content they would\ncarry:\n\n(3.2)  The surf tossed the\nloosened stones against our feet.\n\n(3.3)  A large truck in front\nof him blocked his view of the traffic light.\n(3.4)  Police used a sniffer\ndog to smell the suspect's luggage.\n\n\n\nAs well, the uniform treatment of complements and adjuncts in terms\nof thematic relations does not absolve the computational linguist from\nthe task of identifying the subcategorized constituents of verb\nphrases (and similarly, NPs and APs), so as to guide syntactic and\nsemantic expectations in parsing and interpretation. And these\nsubcategorized constituents correspond closely to the complements of\nthe verb, as distinct from any adjuncts. Nevertheless, thematic role\nrepresentations are widely used, in part because they mesh well with\nframe-based knowledge representations for domain\nknowledge. These are representations that characterize a concept in\nterms of its type (relating this to supertypes and subtypes in an\ninheritance hierarchy), and a set of slots (also called\nattributes or roles) and corresponding values, with\ntype constraints on values. For example, in a purchasing domain, we\nmight have a purchase predicate, perhaps with supertype\nacquire, subtypes like\npurchase-in-installments,\npurchase-on-credit, or\npurchase-with-cash, and attributes with typed values\nsuch as (buyer (a person-or-group)), (seller (a\nperson-or-group)),  (item (a thing-or-service)), (price (a\nmonetary-amount)), and perhaps time, place, and other\nattributes. Thematic roles associated with relevant senses of verbs\nand nouns such as buy, sell, purchase, acquire, acquisition,\ntake-over, pick up, invest in, splurge on, etc., can easily be\nmapped to standard slots like those above. This  leads into the\nissue of canonicalization, which we briefly discuss below under a\nseparate heading.\nExpressivity issues\nA more consequential issue in computational semantics has been the\nexpressivity of the semantic representation employed, with respect to\nphenomena such as event and temporal reference, nonstandard quantifiers\nsuch as most,  plurals,\nmodification, modality and other forms of\nintensionality, and reification. Full discussion of these phenomena\nwould be out of place here, but some commentary on each is warranted,\nsince the process of semantic interpretation and understanding (as well\nas generation) clearly depends on the expressive devices available in\nthe semantic representation.\n\nEvent and situation reference are essential in view of the fact that\nmany sentences seem to describe events or situations, and to qualify and\nrefer to them. For example, in the sentences\n\n(3.5) Molly barked last night for\nseveral minutes. This woke up the neighbors.\n\n\nthe barking event is in effect predicated to have occurred last\nnight and to have lasted for several minutes, and the demonstrative\npronoun\nthis evidently refers directly\nto it; in addition the past tense places\nthe event at some point prior to the time of speech (and would do so\neven without the temporal adverbials). These temporal and causal\nrelations are readily handled within the Davidsonian (or\nneo-Davidsonian) framework mentioned above:\n\n(3.5\u2032)  bark(Molly, E) \u2227\nlast-night(E, S) \u2227 before(E, S)\n\u2227\nduration(E)=minutes(N) \u2227 several(N).\ncause-to-wake-up(E, Neighbors, E\u2032) \u2227 before(E\u2032, S).\n\n\nHowever, examples (3.6) and (3.7) suggest that events can be\nintroduced by negated or quantified formulas, as was originally\nproposed by Reichenbach (1947):\n\n(3.6) No\nrain fell for a month, and this caused widespread crop\nfailures.\n(3.7) Each superpower imperiled the\nother with its nuclear arsenal.\nThis situation persisted for\ndecades.\n\n\n\nBarwise and Perry (1983) reconceptualized this idea in their\nSituation Semantics, though this lacks the tight coupling between\nsentences and events that is arguably needed to capture causal\nrelations expressed in language. Schubert (2000) proposes a solution\nto this problem in an extension of FOL incorporating an operator that\nconnects situations or events with sentences characterizing\nthem.\nConcerning nonstandard quantifiers such as most,\nwe have already sketched the generalized quantifier approach of\nMontague Grammar, and pointed out the alternative of using restricted\nquantifiers; an example might be (Most x:\ndog(x))friendly(x). Instead of\nviewing most as a second-order predicate, we can specify its\nsemantics by analogy with classical quantifiers: The sample formula is\ntrue (under a given interpretation) just in case a majority of\nindividuals satisfying\ndog(x) (when used as value of x) also\nsatisfy friendly(x). Quantifying determiners such\nas few, many, much, almost all, etc., can be treated\nsimilarly, though ultimately the problem of vagueness needs to be\naddressed as well (which of course extends beyond quantifiers to\npredicates and indeed all aspects of a formal semantic\nrepresentation).  Vague quantifiers, rather than setting rigid\nquantitative bounds, seem instead to convey probabilistic information,\nas if a somewhat unreliable measuring instrument had been applied in\nformulating the quantified claim, and the recipient of the information\nneeds to take this unreliability into account in updating\nbeliefs. Apart from their vagueness, the quantifiers under discussion\nare not first-order definable (e.g., Landman 1991), so that they\ncannot be completely axiomatized in FOL.  But this does not prevent\npractical  reasoning, either by direct use of such quantifiers in\nthe logical representations of sentences (an approach in the spirit\nof natural logic), or by reducing them to set-theoretic or\nmereological relations within an FOL framework.\nPlurals, as for instance in\n\n(3.8) People\ngathered in the town square,\n\n\npresent a problem in that the argument of a predicate can be an\nentity comprised of multiple basic individuals (those we ordinarily\nquantify over, and ascribe properties to). Most approaches to this\nproblem employ a plural operator, say, plur, allowing us to\nmap a singular predicate P into a plural predicate\nplur(P), applicable to collective entities. These\ncollective entities are usually assumed to form a join semilattice\nwith atomic elements (singular entities) that are ordinary individuals\n(e.g., Scha 1981; Link 1983; Landman 1989, 2000). When an overlap\nrelation is assumed, and when all elements of the semilattice are\nassumed to have a supremum (completeness), the result is a complete\nBoolean algebra except for lack of a bottom element (because there is\nno null entity that is a part of all others). One theoretical issue is\nthe relationship of the semilattice of plural entities to the\nsemilattice of material parts of which entities are\nconstituted. Though there are differences in theoretical details\n(e.g., Link 1983; Bunt 1985), it is agreed that these semilattices\nshould be aligned in this sense: When we take the join\nof material parts of which several singular or plural entities are\nconstituted, we should obtain the material parts of the join of those\nsingular or plural entities. Note that while some verbal predicates,\nsuch as (intransitive) gather, are applicable only to\ncollections, others, such as ate a pizza, are variously\napplicable to individuals or collections. Consequently, a sentence\nsuch as\n\n(3.9) The\nchildren ate a pizza,\n\n\nallows for both a collective reading, where the children as a group\nate a single pizza, and a distributive reading, where each of the\nchildren ate a pizza (presumably a different one!)  One way of dealing\nwith such ambiguities in practice is to treat plural NPs as ambiguous\nbetween a collection-denoting reading and an \u201ceach member of the\ncollection\u201d reading. For example the children in (3.9)\nwould be treated as ambiguous between the collection of\nchildren (which is the basic sense of the phrase) and each of\nthe children. This entails that a reading of type each of the people \nshould also be available in (3.8) \u2014 but we can assume that this is ruled out \nbecause (intransitive) gather requires a collective argument. \nIn a sentence such as\n\n(3.10) Two poachers caught three aracaris,\n\n\nwe then obtain four readings, based on the two interpretations of\neach NP. No readings are ruled out, because both catching and being\ncaught can be individual or collective occurrences. Some theorists\nwould posit additional readings, but if these exist, they could be\nregarded as derivative from readings in which at least one of the\nterms is collectively interpreted. But what is uncontroversial is that\nplurals call for an enrichment in the semantic representation language\nto allow for collections as arguments. In an expression such\nas plur(child), both the plur operator,\nwhich transforms a predicate into another predicate, and the resulting\ncollective predicate, are of nonstandard types.\nModification is a pervasive\nphenomenon in all languages, as illustrated\nin the following sentences:\n\n(3.11) Mary is very smart.\n(3.12) Mary is an international\ncelebrity.\n\n(3.13) The rebellion failed utterly.\n\n\n\nIn (3.11), very functions as a predicate modifier, in\nparticular a subsective modifier, since the set of things that\nare very(P) is a subset of the things that\nare P.  Do we need such modifiers in our logical forms? We\ncould avoid use of a modifier in this case by supposing\nthat smart has a tacit argument for the degree of smartness,\nwhere smart(x, d) means that x is smart to\ndegree d; adding that d > T for some\nthreshold T would signify that x is very smart.\nOther degree adjectives could be handled similarly. However, such a\nstrategy is unavailable for international celebrity in\n(3.12). International is again subsective (and not\nintersective\u2014an international celebrity is not something that is\nboth international and a celebrity), and while one can imagine\ndefinitions of the particular combination, international\ncelebrity, in an ordinary FOL framework, requiring such\ndefinitions to be available for constructing initial logical forms\ncould create formidable barriers to broad-coverage\ninterpretation. (3.13) illustrates a third type of predicate\nmodification, namely VP-modification by an adverb. Note that the\nmodifier cannot plausibly be treated as an implicit\npredication utter(E) about a Davidsonian event\nargument of fail.  Taken together, the examples indicate the\ndesirability of allowing for monadic-predicate modifiers in a semantic\nrepresentation. Corroborative evidence is provided in the immediately\nfollowing discussion.\n\nIntensionality has already been mentioned in connection with\nMontague Grammar, and there can be no doubt that a semantic\nrepresentation for natural language needs to capture intensionality in\nsome way. The sentences\n\n(3.14)  John believes that our universe is\ninfinite.\n\n(3.15)  John looked happy.\n(3.16)  John designed a starship.\n(3.17)  John wore a fake beard.\n\n\n\nall involve intensionality. The meaning (and thereby the truth\nvalue) of the attitudinal sentence (3.14) depends on the meaning\n(intension) of the subordinate clause, not just its truth value\n(extension). The meaning of (3.15) depends on the meaning of\nhappy, but does not require happy to be a property\nof John or anything else. The meaning of (3.16) does not depend on the\nactual existence of a starship, but does depend on the meaning of that\nphrase. And fake beard in (3.17) refers to something other\nthan an actual beard, though its meaning naturally depends on the\nmeaning of beard.  A Montagovian analysis certainly would\ndeal handily with such sentences. But again, we may ask how much of\nthe expressive richness of Montague's type theory is really essential\nfor computational linguistics. To begin with, sentences such as (3.14)\nare expressible in classical modal logics, without committing to\nhigher types. On the other hand (3.16) resists a classical modal\nanalysis, even more firmly than Montague's \u201cJohn seeks a\nunicorn,\u201d for which an approximate classical paraphrase is\npossible: \u201cJohn tries (for him) to find a unicorn\u201d. A\nmodest concession to Montague, sufficient to handle\n(3.15)\u2013(3.17), is to admit intensional predicate modifiers into\nour representational vocabulary. We can then treat look as a\npredicate modifier, so that look(happy) is a new\npredicate derived from the meaning of happy. Similarly we can\ntreat design as a predicate modifier, if we are willing to\ntreat a starship as a predicative phrase, as we would in\n\u201cThe Enterprise is a starship\u201d. And finally, fake\nis quite naturally viewed as a predicate modifier, though unlike most\nnominal modifiers, it is not intersective (#John wore something\nthat was a beard and was fake) or even subsective (#John wore\na particular kind of beard). Note that this form of\nintensionality does not commit us to a higher-order logic\u2014we are\nnot quantifying over predicate extensions or intensions so far, only\nover individuals (aside from the need to allow for plural entities, as\nnoted). The rather compelling case for intensional predicate modifiers\nin our semantic vocabulary reinforces the case made above (on the\nbasis on extensional examples) for allowing predicate\nmodification.\nReification, like the\nphenomena already enumerated, is also pervasive\nin natural languages. Examples are seen in the following sentences.\n\n(3.18) Humankind may be on a path to\nself-destruction.\n(3.19) Snow is white.\n\n(3.20) Politeness is a virtue.\n\n(3.21) Driving recklessly is\ndangerous.\n\n(3.22) For John to sulk is unusual.\n\n(3.23) That our universe\nis infinite is a discredited notion.\n\n\n(3.18)\u2013(3.21) are all examples of predicate\nreification. Humankind in (3.18) may be regarded as the name\nof an abstract kind derived from the nominal predicate human,\ni.e., with lexical meaning K(human),\nwhere K maps predicate intensions to individuals. The status\nof abstract kinds as individuals is evidenced by the fact that the\npredicate \u201cbe on a path to self-destruction\u201d applies as\nreadily to ordinary individuals as to kinds. The name-like character\nof the term is apparent from the fact that it cannot readily be\npremodified by an adjective. The subjects in (3.19) and (3.20) can be\nsimilarly analyzed in terms of kinds K(snow) and\nK(-ness(polite)). (Here -ness is a\npredicate modifier that transforms the predicate polite,\nwhich applies to ordinary (usually human) individuals, into a\npredicate over quantities of the abstract stuff, politeness.) But in\nthese cases the K operator does not originate in the lexicon,\nbut in a rule pair of type \u201cNP \u2192  N, NP\u2032 =\nK(N\u2032)\u201d. This allows for modification of the nominal\npredicate before reification, in phrases such as fluffy snow\nor excessive politeness. The subject of (3.21) might be\nrendered logically as something like\nKa(-ly(reckless)(drive)), where\nKa reifies action-predicates, and -ly \ntransforms a monadic predicate intension into a subsective predicate\nmodifier. Finally (3.22) illustrates a type of sentential-meaning\nreification, again yielding a kind; but in this case it is a kind of\nsituation\u2014the kind whose instances are characterized by John\nsulking. Here we can posit a reification operator Ke that\nmaps sentence intensions into kinds of situations. This type of\nsentential reification needs to be distinguished from\nthat-clause reification, such as appears to be involved in\n(3.14). We mentioned the possibility of a modal-logic analysis of\n(3.14), but a predicative analysis, where the predicate applies to a\nreified sentence intension (a proposition) is actually more plausible,\nsince it allows a uniform treatment of that-clauses in contexts like\n(3.14) and (3.23). The use of reification operators is a departure\nfrom a strict Montgovian approach, but is plausible if we seek to\nlimit the expressiveness of our semantic representation by taking\npredicates to be true or false of individuals, rather than of objects\nof arbitrarily high types, and likewise take quantification to be over\nindividuals in all cases, i.e., to be first-order.\nSome computational linguists and AI researchers wish to go much\nfurther in avoiding expressive devices outside those of standard\nfirst-order logic. One strategy that can be used to deal with\nintensionality within FOL is to functionalize all predicates, save one\nor two. For example, we can treat predications, such as that Romeo\nloves Juliet, as values of functions that \u201chold\u201d at particular times:\nHolds(loves(Romeo, Juliet), t). Here\nloves is regarded as a function that yields a reified\nproperty, while Holds (or in some\nproposals, True), and perhaps equality, are the only\npredicates in the representation language. Then we can formalize\n(3.14), for example, without recourse to intensional semantics as\n\nHolds(believes(John, infinite(Universe)), t)\n\n(where t is some specific time). Humankind in\n(3.18) can perhaps be represented as the set of all humans as a\nfunction of time:\n\n \u2200x\u2200t[Holds(member(x,\n Humankind), t)\n \u2194 Holds(human(x), t)],\n\n(presupposing some axiomatization of na\u00efve set theory); and, as\none more example, (4.22) might be rendered as\n\nHolds(unusual(sulk(John)), t)\n\n\n(for some specific time t).  However, a difficulty with this\nstrategy is encountered for quantification within intensional\ncontexts, as in the sentence \u201cJohn believes that every galaxy\nharbors some life-form.\u201d While we can represent the\n(implausible) wide-scope reading \u201cFor every galaxy there is some\nlife-form such that John believes that the galaxy harbors that\nlife-form,\u201d using the Holds strategy, we cannot readily\nrepresent the natural narrow-scope reading because FOL disallows\nvariable-binding operators within functional terms (but see McCarthy\n1990). An entirely different approach is to\nintroduce \u201ceventuality\u201d arguments into all predicates, and\nto regard a predication as providing a fact about the actual world\nonly if the eventuality corresponding to that predication has been\nasserted to \u201coccur\u201d (Hobbs 2003). The main practical\nimpetus behind such approaches is to be able to exploit existing FOL\ninference techniques and technology. However, there is at present no\nreason to believe that any inferences that are easy in FOL are\ndifficult in a meaning representation more nearly aligned with the\nstructure of natural language; on the contrary, recent work in\nimplementing natural logic (MacCartney & Manning 2009)\nsuggests that a large class of obvious inferences can be most readily\nimplemented in syntactically analyzed natural language\n(modulo some adjustments)\u2014a framework closer to\nMontagovian semantics than an FOL-based approach.\nCanonicalization, thematic roles (again), and primitives\nAnother important issue has been canonicalization\n(or normalization):\nWhat transformations should be applied to initial\nlogical forms in\norder to minimize difficulties in making use of linguistically derived\ninformation? The uses that should be facilitated by the choice of\ncanonical representation include the interpretation of further texts in\nthe context of previously interpreted text (and general knowledge), as\nwell as inferential question answering and other inference tasks.\nWe can distinguish two types of canonicalization: logical\nnormalization and conceptual canonicalization.  An\nexample of logical normalization in sentential logic and FOL is the\nconversion to clause form (Skolemized, quantifier-free conjunctive\nnormal form). The rationale is that reducing multiple logically\nequivalent formulas to a single form reduces the combinatorial\ncomplexity of inference. However, full normalization may not be\npossible in an intensional logic with a \u201cfine-grained\u201d\nsemantics, where for instance a belief that the Earth is round may\ndiffer semantically from the belief that the Earth is round and the\nMoon is either flat or not flat, despite the logical equivalence of\nthose beliefs.\nConceptual canonicalization involves more radical changes:\nWe replace the surface predicates (and perhaps other elements of the\nrepresentational vocabulary) with canonical terms from a smaller\nrepertoire, and/or decompose them using thematic roles or frame slots.\nFor example, in a geographic domain, we might replace the relations\n(between countries) is next to, is adjacent to, borders on, is a\nneighbor of, shares a border with, etc., with a single canonical\nrelation, say borders-on. In the domain of physical,\ncommunicative, and mental events, we might go further and decompose\npredicates into configurations of primitive predicates. For example,\nwe might express \u201cx walks\u201d in the manner of Schank\nas\n\n\u2203e, e\u2032(ptrans(e, x, x) \u2227\nmove(e\u2032, x, feet-of(x))\n\u2227 by-means-of(e\u2032, e)),\n\nwhere ptrans(e, x, y) is a primitive\npredicate expressing that event e is a physical transport by\nagent x of object y, move\nexpresses bodily motion by an agent, and\nby-means-of expresses the instrumental-action\nrelation between the move\nevent and the ptrans event.\nAs discussed earlier, these multi-argument predicates might be further\ndecomposed, with ptrans(e, x, y) rewritten as\nptrans(e)\n\u2227 agent(e, x)\n\u2227 theme(e, y), and so on. As in\nthe case of logical normalization, conceptual canonicalization is\nintended to simplify inference, and to minimize the need for the\naxioms on which inference is based.\nA question raised by canonicalization, especially by the stronger\nversions involving reduction to primitives, is whether significant\nmeaning is lost in this process. For example, the concept of being\nneighboring countries, unlike mere adjacency, suggests the idea of\nside-by-side existence of the populations of the countries, in a way\nthat resembles the side-by-side existence of neighbors in a local\ncommunity. More starkly, reducing the notion of walking to transporting\noneself by moving one's feet fails to distinguish walking from running,\nhopping, skating, and perhaps even bicycling. Therefore it may be\npreferable to regard conceptual canonicalization as inference of\nimportant entailments, rather than as replacement of superficial\nlogical forms by equivalent ones in a more restricted vocabulary.\nAnother argument for the latter position is computational: If we\ndecompose complex actions, such as dining at a restaurant, into\nconstellations of primitive predications, we will need to match the\nmany primitive parts of such constellations even in answering simple\nquestions such as \n\u201cDid John dine at a restaurant?\u201d. We will comment\nfurther on primitives in the context of the following subsection.\n",
