    "main_text": "Terminological Clarifications\n1. Terminological Clarifications\n\nAn argument can be defined as a complex symbolic structure where some\nparts, known as the premises, offer support to another part, the\nconclusion. Alternatively, an argument can be viewed as a complex\nspeech act consisting of one or more acts of premising (which assert\npropositions in favor of the conclusion), an act of concluding, and a\nstated or implicit marker (\u201chence\u201d,\n\u201ctherefore\u201d) that indicates that the conclusion follows\nfrom the premises (Hitchcock\n 2007).[1]\n The relation of support between premises and conclusion can be cashed\nout in different ways: the premises may guarantee the truth of the\nconclusion, or make its truth more probable; the premises may imply\nthe conclusion; the premises may make the conclusion more acceptable\n(or assertible).\n\nFor theoretical purposes, arguments may be considered as freestanding\nentities, abstracted from their contexts of use in actual human\nactivities. But depending on one\u2019s explanatory goals, there is\nalso much to be gained from considering arguments as they in fact\noccur in human communicative practices. The term generally used for\ninstances of exchange of arguments is argumentation. In what\nfollows, the convention of using \u201cargument\u201d to refer to\nstructures of premises and conclusion, and \u201cargumentation\u201d\nto refer to human practices and activities where arguments occur as\ncommunicative actions will be adopted.\n\nArgumentation can be defined as the communicative activity of\nproducing and exchanging reasons in order to support claims or\ndefend/challenge positions, especially in situations of doubt or\ndisagreement (Lewi\u0144ski & Mohammed 2016). It is arguably best\nconceived as a kind of dialogue, even if one can also\n\u201cargue\u201d with oneself, in long speeches or in writing (in\narticles or books) for an intended but silent audience, or in groups\nrather than in dyads (Lewi\u0144ski & Aakhus 2014). But\nargumentation is a special kind of dialogue: indeed, most of\nthe dialogues we engage in are not instances of argumentation, for\nexample when asking someone if they know what time it is, or when\nsomeone shares details about their vacation. Argumentation only occurs\nwhen, upon making a claim, someone receives a request for further\nsupport for the claim in the form of reasons, or estimates herself\nthat further justification is required (Jackson & Jacobs 1980;\nJackson, 2019). In such cases, dialogues of \u201cgiving and asking\nfor reasons\u201d ensue (Brandom, 1994; Bermejo Luque 2011). Since\nmost of what we know we learn from others, argumentation seems to be\nan important mechanism to filter the information we receive, instead\nof accepting what others tell us uncritically (Sperber,\nCl\u00e9ment, et al. 2010).\n\nThe study of arguments and argumentation is also closely connected to\nthe study of reasoning, understood as the process of reaching\nconclusions on the basis of careful, reflective consideration of the\navailable information, i.e., by an examination of reasons.\nAccording to a widespread view, reasoning and argumentation are\nrelated (as both concern reasons) but fundamentally different\nphenomena: reasoning would belong to the mental realm of\nthinking\u2014an individual inferring new information from the\navailable information by means of careful consideration of\nreasons\u2014whereas argumentation would belong to the public realm\nof the exchange of reasons, expressed in language or other\nsymbolic media and intended for an audience. However, a number of\nauthors have argued for a different view, namely that reasoning and\nargumentation are in fact two sides of the same coin, and that what is\nknown as reasoning is by and large the internalization of practices of\nargumentation (MacKenzie 1989; Mercier & Sperber 2017; Mercier\n2018). For the purposes of this entry, we can assume a close\nconnection between reasoning and argumentation so that relevant\nresearch on reasoning can be suitably included in the discussions to\ncome.\n",
