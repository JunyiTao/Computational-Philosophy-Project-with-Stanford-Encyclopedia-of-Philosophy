    "main_text": "Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls? || \u201cOn Being Ashamed of Oneself: An Essay on Race Pride\u201d (1933)\n4.2 \u201cOn Being Ashamed of Oneself: An Essay on Race Pride\u201d (1933)\n\nDu Bois begins the essay, published in Crisis in September,\n1933, with a story about his grandfather, who indignantly rejected an\ninvitation to a \u201cNegro\u201d picnic:\n\n[i]t meant close association with poverty, ignorance and suppressed\nand disadvantaged people, dirty and with bad manners. (Du Bois 1933:\n199)\n\n\nHe then succinctly captures the whole dilemma of those in the Negro\n\u2018upper crust\u2019:\n\nbecause the upper colored group is desperately afraid of being\nrepresented before American whites by this lower group, or being\nmistaken for them, or being treated as though they were part of it,\nthey are pushed to the extreme of effort to avoid contact with the\npoorest classes of Negroes. This exaggerates, at once, the secret\nshame of being identified with such people and the anomaly of\ninsisting that the physical characteristics of these folk which the\nupper class shares, are not the stigmata of degradation. (1933: 199)\n\n\nHere Du Bois draws out the intra-racial implications and grounds of\nthis aspect of double consciousness \u2013 what he identifies as\n\u201cbeing ashamed\u201d of members of one\u2019s group, and, so,\nindirectly and implicitly, of oneself. He also reiterates a theme\narising from the first in his thinking about double-consciousness\n\u2013 its close connection to divergent personal and political\nstrategies for managing, and working to transform, its social\nconditions. He identified these especially in the 1903\n\u201cFaith\u201d text, where he speaks both of \u201cdouble\nclasses\u201d and of \u201cpretense or revolt\u201d,\n\u201chypocrisy or radicalism\u201d. In the 1920 text, Du Bois notes\nthat such feelings of shame can motivate the strategy of \u201crace\nsuicide\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe attempt to escape from\nourselves\u201d, as he describes assimilation. This attempt involves\n\u2013 and also is grounded in \u2013 \u201ca drawing of class\nlines inside the Negro race\u201d and \u201cthe emergence of a\ncertain social aristocracy\u201d defined by \u201clooks\u201d\n\u2013 by which Du Bois presumably means complexion \u2013 as well\nas education, income, cultivation, and aspiration.\n\nBut this sense of shame is both impediment and adjunct of any strategy\nbased on race pride and solidarity, as well, since it can undermine\nany concerted political action, which demands racial unity in common\ncause, and under the leadership of the \u201ctalented tenth\u201d of\nrace aristocrats, to be successful. While calling for efforts\n\u201cto build up a racial ethos\u201d, Du Bois thus warns against\ntoo extreme a version of such \u201cpropaganda for race pride\u201d,\ncounseling Blacks to avoid reproducing what he describes as a\n\u201csuperiority complex among the white and the yellow\nrace\u201d.\n",
