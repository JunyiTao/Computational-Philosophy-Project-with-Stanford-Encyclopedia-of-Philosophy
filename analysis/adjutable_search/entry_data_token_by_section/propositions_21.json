One promising line of\nthinking, in this regard, is to think of propositions as types, the\ntokens of which are mental or linguistic acts or events, and in\nparticular the acts that would be thought to express the\nproposition. Such views have been developed in recent years by Dummett\n(1996), Hanks (2011, 2015), and Soames (2010, 2014a, 2015). We focus\nhere on the recent proposals put forth by Hanks and Soames.\n\nThe type view is motivated by its answers to otherwise puzzling\nfeatures of traditional Platonist views of propositions (e.g. Frege\n(1984)). On this view, belief and other attitudes are understood as\nrelations to already-existing propositions which represent things as\nbeing a certain way. The truth or falsity of an individual\u2019s\nbelief or other cognitive state is explained by the truth or falsity\nof the proposition which is the object of that state. If truth\nconsists in a representation\u2019s being accurate, then a\nproposition is true just in case it accurately represents things as\nbeing a certain way. Thus, on the traditional view, thinking subjects\nrepresent things as being a certain way (either in thought or\nlanguage) by standing in appropriate relations to propositions which\nfundamentally represent things as being a certain way.\n\nTwo problems arise for the Platonist\u2019s position. First, how do\ncognizers come to be acquainted with such propositions? Second, what\nexplains how propositions represent things as being a certain way?\nPlatonists appear to have no answer to the epistemic question, and\npresumably accept representation as a primitive feature of\npropositions. Type theorists, however, explain the relation between a\ncognizer and a proposition simply as an instance of the general\nrelation between type and token. Consider, as Dummett (1996, p. 259)\ndoes, one\u2019s humming of a tune. The tune is a species or type of\nmusical performance capable of having multiple performances at\ndiffering times or locations, while the humming of it is a token act\nbelonging to that type. One might then see the relation of a\nproposition to a mental or linguistic act as one between the type of\nact performed and the performance of the act.\n\nWhat type of acts should one identify with propositions? For both\nHanks and Soames, propositions are types of predicative acts.\nThe notion of predication here is simply, for atomic propositions, one\nof an agent\u2019s representing an object \\(o\\) as having property\n\\(F\\). (Hanks (2015, p. 64) characterizes predication as\ncategorization, or the sorting of things into groups\naccording to a rule. We will take this to be a form of\nrepresentation.) Since representation is primarily something done by\ncognitive agents, according to Hanks and Soames, one might wonder\nwhether the proposition itself is representational, and so possesses\ntruth-conditions, on the type view. Both theorists respond to this\nconcern by claiming that propositions are representational in a\nsecondary, derivative sense. There are many examples of types that\ninherit features of their tokens (a sonata (type) can be discordant in\nvirtue of performances of it being discordant; a movie can be\nfrightening in virtue of its tokens being so, etc. See the entry on\n types and tokens.)\n Just as an act can be described as intelligent in order to\ncommunicate that the agent acted intelligently in performing\nthe act, type theorists will claim that a proposition represents \\(o\\)\nas \\(F\\) in a similarly derivative sense wherein any agent who\nperforms the act of predicating \\(F\\) of \\(o\\) will thereby represent\n\\(o\\) as \\(F\\). One question that arises for such a view is whether\npropositions are genuinely representational entities with\ntruth-conditions, or whether the claim that a proposition represents\nthings as being a certain way is simply a convenient manner of\nspeaking indirectly about the actual and possible representational\nacts of thinkers.\n\nAs we have seen, the type view reverses the traditional order of\nexplanation concerning the nature of predication, representation, and\ntruth-conditions. On the traditional, Fregean picture, propositions\nexist as objective, mind-independent entities \u201cwaiting\u201d to\nbe entertained, judged or asserted, so to speak. On this view, for a\nsubject S to predicate \\(F\\) of \\(o\\) is for S to entertain the\nproposition that \\(o\\) is \\(F\\); for S to represent \\(o\\) as \\(F\\) in\nthought or language is to have have a thought or utterance with the\nprimarily representational proposition that o is F as its\ncontent, etc. On the type view, a proposition\u2019s representational\nand predicative properties are derived from the fundamentally\nrepresentational and predicative acts of agents.\n\nA concern for the type view is whether there will be \u201cmissing\npropositions\u201d\u2014truths or falsehoods which have never been\nentertained. One drawn to the type view may allow for the existence of\nuninstantiated types to account for the existence of these\npropositions. However, given that propositions are claimed to derive\ntheir representational features from their tokens, such uninstantiated\ntypes would lack representational features, and so lack\ntruth-conditions. Hanks suggests dealing with such propositions\ncounterfactually. Even if no one had ever predicated eloquence of\nClinton, the proposition that Clinton is eloquent is true iff Clinton\nis eloquent because if someone were to predicate eloquence of\nClinton, the token would be true iff Clinton is eloquent. Predicative\ntypes, then, inherit their representation features from both their\nactual and possible tokens. This response, however, leaves us with the\nquestion of truths for which there are not even any merely possible\ntokens\u2014for example, mathematical truths that are too complicated\nfor any finite mind to grasp. What, if anything, provides the\ntruth-conditions of these propositions?\n\nHanks (2015, p. 27) allows that propositions are mind-independent and\nobjective entities which do not depend for their existence on having\nany tokens, just as one might think about a difficult type of dive\nthat has never been performed. Thus, while Hanks\u2019 view appears\nto be a rejection of a traditional Platonism about propositions, it\nseems nevertheless to accept a Platonism about types by untethering\ntheir existence from their tokens. (Compare to Dodd\u2019s (2007)\ndefense of Platonism about types.) Soames (2014a,b) also allows for\nuntokened types, but only those whose constituents have been referred\nto or predicated in other propositions. For Soames, a proposition\n\\(p\\) may exist in \\(w\\) even if no token of \\(p\\) has been performed\nin \\(w\\). For Soames, if in \\(w\\) a predicative event has occurred in\nwhich an agent predicates \\(n\\)-place property \\(R\\) of \\(n\\) objects,\nand in \\(w\\) events of referring to or thinking of objects \\(o_1,\n\\ldots, o_n\\) have occurred, then the proposition that is the type of\nact of predicating \\(R\\) of \\(o_1, \\ldots, o_n\\) exists (even if \\(R\\)\nhas never been predicated of \\(o_1, \\ldots, o_n\\) in \\(w)\\). Still, it\nwould seem that there can be truths in a world about objects that have\nnever been thought of or referred to in that world. In response to\nthis, Soames claims that a proposition need not exist in a world \\(w\\)\nin order to be true in \\(w\\). In support of this, Soames appeals to\nother, albeit controversial, cases in which an object can have a\nproperty despite not existing. For instance, Socrates can have the\nproperties of being referred to or being admired\ndespite no longer existing. Thus, Soames\u2019 accommodation of our\nintuitions concerning propositions that have never been thought\nappears to involve a rejection of Actualism.\n\nThe type view has been argued to provide solutions to several\ntraditional problems for propositional thought, including\nFrege\u2019s puzzle, first-person belief, Kripke\u2019s puzzle about\nbelief, and the problem of empty names. In responding to these\nproblems, Soames invokes \u201cMillian modes of presentation,\u201d\nor ways of cognizing an object in thought which do not affect the\nrepresentational content of the act, to preserve a non-Fregean,\nMillian view of semantic content for names and natural kind terms\nwhile individuating propositions finely enough to solve traditional\nproblems in the philosophy of language. Hanks, by contrast, invokes\ndistinct types of referential and expressive acts as the constituents\nof propositions. On this view, each use of a name falls under several\ndifferent reference types which differ in their fineness of grain,\neach associated with a different proposition.\n\nAs we have seen, the type view is motivated in large part by the\nperceived need to explain how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way on the grounds that a view which accepts primitively\nrepresentational propositions is objectionably mysterious. Some\nquestion, however, whether the representational properties of\npropositions can (or need to) be explained at all (McGlone 2012,\nCaplan, et al. 2013, Merricks 2015). Merricks, for example, argues\nthat we should accept that there are fundamentally representational\nentities, but that we have no reason to favor mental states (such as\nbeliefs) over propositions as being the fundamental bearers of\nrepresentational properties. For if, e.g., beliefs are fundamentally\nrepresentational, then it is either a primitive fact about them that\nthey represent what they do, or it is a feature capable of\nexplanation. If it is a primitive fact about them, then the view\nappears just as mysterious as one which accepts that propositions are\nprimitively representational. If it is a fact capable of explanation,\nas the type theorists contend, then it is presumably explained in\nterms of an agent\u2019s ability to predicate properties of objects.\nBut unless there is some explanation of how an agent can engage in\npredication, predication must itself be a primitive representational\nability, and the theory has not made any genuine progress on what was\nto be explained.\n\nA final question worth considering at this stage is whether\npropositions are representational entities at all. Richard (2013) and\nSpeaks (2014), for instance, each develop views of propositions which\ndeny that they are. Consider the view defended by Richard. Sentences,\nbeliefs, and the like represent things as being a certain\nway\u2014snow as being white, for example. Put another way, the\nsentence \u2018Snow is white\u2019 represents snow\u2019s being\nwhite, where this is simply a way for things to be\u2014a state of\naffairs or property that is either instantiated or not (but does not\nrepresent things as being any way, just as properties are not in\ngeneral representational). On this approach, the proposition expressed\nby the sentence is identified with the way that things are represented\nas being, not as something which has representational properties\neither primitively or in need of explanation by more fundamental acts\nof predication. If an approach along these lines is correct, the type\nview appears to lose one of its central motivations.\n8. The Individuation of Propositions\n\nSome philosophers, notably W.V.O. Quine, recognize the existence of\ncertain sorts of abstract entities but not others at least partly on\nthe basis of concerns about identity conditions. Quine granted the\nexistence of sets, in part because they obey the extensionality axiom:\nsets are identical iff they have the same members. When it came to\nproperties, relations and propositions, however, he found no such\nclear criterion of identity. The property of being a creature with a\nheart, he noted, is distinct from the property of being a creature\nwith a kidney, even if all the same things exemplify the two\nproperties.\n\nIt is a controversial matter whether Quine was right to demand such\nrigorous criteria of identity as a condition for acceptance of a class\nof entities. However, even if Quine asks too much, any good theory of\npropositions ought to have something to say about when propositions\nare identical and when they are distinct. Developing theories which\ngive such accounts in a way that fits well with intuitive data\nconcerning propositional attitude ascriptions would enhance our\nreasons to accept propositions.\n\nThe question of identity conditions for propositions is importantly\nrelated to the question of whether propositions are structured\nentities. Propositions are structured if they have\nconstituents, in some broad sense, and the order of the\nconstituents matters. Order matters only if there could be two\nstructured propositions sharing all the same constituents, but which\nare distinct due to differences in the way under which those\nconstituents are \u201cunited\u201d in the proposition. E.g., if the\nproposition that \\(a\\) loves \\(b\\) is the ordered triple\n\\(\\ltb\\)loving, \\(a, b\\gtb\\), it is distinct from the\nproposition that \\(b\\) loves \\(a\\), which would be the ordered triple\n\\(\\ltb\\)loving, \\(b, a\\gtb\\).\n\nIf propositions are structured entities, then sameness of constituents\nand sameness of order will entail identity. There are, of course,\ndangers, in regarding propositions as structured. Prima facie, one\nwould rather not claim that the proposition that \\(x\\) is triangular\nis identical to the proposition that \\(x\\) is trilateral, since a\nsubject might believe one but not the other. It will be important,\nthen, not to individuate propositions too coarsely. However, one might\nworry, in the opposing direction, about overly fine individuations of\npropositions. Is the proposition that John loves Mary different from\nthe proposition that Mary is loved by John? For more on structured\npropositions, see the entry on\n structured propositions.[10]\n\nAny theory that construes propositions as structured entities would\nseem to face the problem of the unity of the proposition. It\nis not entirely straightforward to say what this problem or set of\nproblems is. But at the very least, there are at least two problems\nhere. There is the problem of explaining why one sort of structured\nwhole, a proposition, can be true or false, while the set of its\nconstituents is not. A list isn\u2019t true or false, and a\nproposition with the same constituents is; why is this? Second, there\nis a general problem of explaining how two distinct things could have\nall the same constituents. For a thorough discussion of the history of\nphilosophical work on the unity of the sentence and the proposition,\nthe reader should consult Gaskin (2008).\n\nSome hold that propositions lack constituents altogether, and so are\nunstructured. If propositions are unstructured, then if they are sets,\nthey inherit the identity conditions for sets: sameness of members.\nThus, if a proposition is the set of worlds in which it is true (as in\nStalnaker 1976), then \\(P=Q\\) iff \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have the same worlds\nas members iff \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true in the same worlds. As is\nwell-known, this theory leads to a very coarse individuation of\npropositions, too coarse, arguably, to handle propositional attitudes.\n(See Soames (1987) for a discussion of this theory as well as the\ntheory of propositions as sets of concrete situations or facts.\n\nIf propositions are unstructured and distinct from sets, there are\nseveral possibilities for explaining their identity conditions. First,\nidentity conditions might be specified in terms of possible attitudes.\nOne possibility is this: \\(P=Q\\) if, necessarily whoever believes\n(asserts, denies, etc.) \\(P\\) believes (asserts, denies, etc.) \\(Q\\),\nand vice versa. Second, proposition identity might be reduced to\nproperty identity in the manner of Myhill (1963) and Zalta (1983).\nThus, Zalta (1983, 72) offers the following definition of proposition\nidentity: \\(\\ltb p\\gtb =\\ltb q\\gtb\\) if and only if the property of\nbeing such that \\(p\\) is identical to the property of being such that\n\\(q\\). A third proposal, not incompatible with the second, is to\nexplain proposition identity in terms of the \u201cfree\ngeneration\u201d of propositions from a stock of certain\nnon-propositional entities, e.g., individuals, properties and\nrelations, by algebraic operations (Bealer 1982, Menzel 1986, Zalta\n1983 and\n 1989).[11]\n Although propositions on this approach are unstructured, each\nproposition may be represented by its \u201cconstruction\nsequence.\u201d To avoid identifying \\(\\ltb\\)Hesperus is\nbeautiful\\(\\gtb\\) with \\(\\ltb\\)Phosphorus is beautiful\\(\\gtb\\), the\nrelevant inputs cannot simply be Hesperus (Phosphorus) and the\nproperty of being beautiful. A well-known strategy to cope with this\nproblem, due to Frege, is to appeal to different modes of presentation\nassociated with the different names, each contributing something\ndifferent to the proposition expressed. However, these modes need not\nbe understood as complex properties uniquely exemplified by referent\nof the name. For instance, Bealer (1998) invokes what he calls\n\u201cnon-Platonic\u201d modes of presentation. Whether these\nnon-Platonic modes of presentation are understood as words, as causal\nchains of word use, or in some other way, the important point is that\nthe mode associated with \u2018Hesperus\u2019 will be different than\nthat associated with \u2018Phosphorus\u2019. Zalta (1989) introduces\npropositions with abstract constituents to do the work of these modes.\nOn Zalta\u2019s view, such singular propositions are built out of\nabstract individuals that encode the cognitive content of names. Since\nthese abstract individuals encode this cognitive content, there is no\nneed for the referent of the name to instantiate it, and a fortiori no\nneed for the content to be a property uniquely instantiated by this\nreferent. For more on encoding vs. instantiating, see section 6 of the\nentry on\n existence.\n Thus, these theorists hope to use the metaphysical tools of these\nalgebraic accounts to accommodate some of the key Fregean intuitions\nabout differences in propositions expressed while avoiding\ndifficulties with the Fregean doctrine of sense.\n\nFor a recent criticism of the notion of propositional constituency,\nsee Keller (2013); for a positive account of propositional\nconstituency, see Gilmore (2014).\n9. Propositions, Facts, and States of Affairs\n\nFrege famously wrote, \u201c\u2018Facts, facts, facts\u2019 cries\nthe scientist if he wants to bring home the necessity of a firm\nfoundation for science. What is a fact? A fact is a thought that is\ntrue.\u201d (1918, p. 25)\n\nIs a fact just a true proposition? There are metaphysical and\nlinguistic arguments to the contrary. Here is a standard metaphysical\nargument. The fact that snow is white couldn\u2019t exist if snow\nwasn\u2019t white, but the true proposition would (only it would be\nfalse). Therefore, the fact isn\u2019t the true proposition (See\nMoore 1953, p. 308). Facts might be, still, in some sense,\nderivative from true propositions, even if the identity claim fails.\nFollowing Moore (1953, pp. 261\u20132) and Slote (1974, p. 99), Kit\nFine (1982, pp. 52\u20133) suggests that facts may be conceived as\nconcretizations of true propositions. Thus, the fact that \\(p\\) is the\ntruth of \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\). However, so construing facts makes them poor\ncandidates for truthmakers: the truth of \\(p\\), presumably, is not\nwhat makes \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) true.\n\nOne well-known linguistic argument against identifying facts with true\npropositions is closely related to the Ambiguity Response to The\nSubstitution Problem, considered in Section 5.4. Substitution of\n\u2018the fact that \\(p\\)\u2019 for \u2018the true proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, or vice versa, produces peculiarities such as\n\u201cJohn believes the fact that Obama is president\u201d, or\nHarman\u2019s (2003) \u201cThe true proposition that fires are hot\nmakes it the case that fires are hot.\u201d If facts were true\npropositions, so it is argued, one would expect the substitutions to\npreserve truth.\n\nNonetheless, there are other uses of \u2018fact\u2019 that support\nthe identification:\n\nSnow is white. That\u2019s a fact. But it wouldn\u2019t have been a\nfact if snow were not white. So, some things that are facts might not\nhave been facts.\n\n\nUsed in this way, \u2018fact\u2019 seems to apply to entities that\nresemble propositions, in that they have two modes of being: existence\nand something akin to truth (e.g., obtaining) (see McGrath\n 2003).[12]\n\nOne option, in the face of apparently conflicting uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019, is to posit an ambiguity. (Fine 1982, p. 54) There\nare two kinds of entity associated with different uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019: one kind has one mode of being (it simply exists),\nthe other has having two modes of being (it may exist without\nobtaining). \u201cBipolar\u201d facts correspond, roughly, to what\nsome philosophers call possible states of affairs.\n\nHowever, some philosophers would want to distinguish even such bipolar\nfacts from propositions. Bipolar facts, the argument goes, are states\nof affairs, rather than true propositions. Clearly, not all\npropositions can be possible states of affairs, because there are\npropositions that are not possibly true, whereas possible states of\naffairs must obtain in at least some possible world. We might wish to\nextend the notion of a state of affairs to include impossible ones.\nWhether states of affairs, understood in this extended sense, are\npropositions clearly depends on the answers to questions about their\nidentity conditions. See the entry on\n states of affairs,\n as well as Richard (2013) for a recent view identifying propositions\nwith states of affairs.\n\nKing (1995, 2007, 2014) argues that all propositions are facts,\nalthough not the ones that we might expect. The proposition that Mary\nloves John is not the fact that Mary loves John but rather (to a first\napproximation) the following fact: Mary, loving, and John being the\nsemantic values of linguistic items standing in a certain syntactic\nrelation (represented by a phrase marker tree) which encodes\ninstantiation. King argues that his account has many virtues. It helps\nsolve the problem of the unity of the proposition (see the previous\nsection), insofar as the structure of a proposition derives from the\nsyntactic structure of a corresponding sentence. It requires\nrelatively minimal ontological commitments: if one accepts that there\nare languages with expressions designating objects and properties and\nin which certain syntactic relations encode instantiation, then one\nwill accept King-propositions. The account also provides for finely\nindividuated propositions: differences in syntactic structure of\nsentences will carry over to differences in the propositions\nexpressed. Given that the existence of King-propositions seems to\ndepend on their being language-users who use language in certain ways,\nKing is a conceptualist about propositions. (See section 7.2\nabove).\n10. Sparse and Abundant Conceptions of Propositions\n\nIn discussing the question of whether there are properties, D. M.\nArmstrong (1989) distinguishes sparse from abundant conceptions of\nproperties. Following standard terminology, let us say that when a\npredicate has a property as its semantic content, the predicate\nexpresses that property. (For simplicity, we will assume that\nsentences can have propositions as semantic contents.) Under an\nabundant conception of properties, whether a predicate expresses a\nproperty depends only on its broadly syntactic facts about it. The\nsimplest abundant conception holds that every well-formed predicate\nexpresses a property. According to sparse conceptions, not every\nsyntactically well-formed predicate expresses a property.\n\nA similar distinction may be applied to conceptions of propositions.\nAbundant conceptions will impose only broadly syntactic restrictions\non the expression of propositions. Sparse conceptions will deny that\nhaving the relevant syntactic properties is sufficient for the\nexpression and designation of propositions. Abundant conceptions of\npropositions face the threat of paradox. For more, see the discussion\non\n the Russell-Myhill Paradox\n in the entry on Alonzo Church.\n10.1 Expressivism and Moral Propositions\n\nOne motivation for accepting a sparse conception of propositions is\nexpressivism in metaethics. \u201cOld-fashioned\u201d expressivists\n(e.g., Ayer and Stevenson) claimed that moral sentences are\nnon-cognitive. We cannot believe that lying in politics is wrong, nor\ncan we have any broadly cognitive attitudes (e.g., disbelief) of the\nform \u2018\\(A\\)-ing that \\(p\\)\u2019 where \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019\ncontains moral terms. If we cannot have such attitudes, then\npresumably there are no moral propositions. (If there were such\npropositions, why wouldn\u2019t there be possible cognitive attitudes\nhaving them as contents?). And if there are no moral propositions,\nthen moral sentences do not express propositions, and so lack\ntruth-value.\n\nWe certainly talk and think as if we have moral beliefs, as if we\nbelieve moral propositions. For the old-fashioned expressivist, then,\nmany of our apparently sincere ordinary claims will have to be\nrejected. Endorsing such a sparse conception of propositions thus\nleads to the surprising consequence all moral sentences lack\ntruth-value.\n\nSome contemporary expressivists (Blackburn 1998, Horwich 1993, Stoljar\n1993) are less averse to moral propositions, moral properties and\nmoral facts. But they take these commitments as\n shallow.[13]\n They accept an abundant conception of propositions, properties, etc.,\nbut combine it with a generous dose of deflationism. There are moral\npropositions, but they are mere shadows of moral declarative\nsentences. (Even if they are shadows of our sentences in some sense,\nthey are not shadows in another sense, at least if the Easy Arguments\nfor mind-independence and abstractness are successful: what is\nmind-independent and abstract is, in a clear sense, not merely a\nshadow of sentences.)\n\nAt least three important questions can be asked about the combination\nof expressivism and deflationism about moral propositions. First, if\nthe expressivist accepts moral propositions, what is the difference\nbetween expressivism and realism? Second, by accepting deflationary\nmoral propositions, can the expressivist avoid the familiar problems\nfor moral realism (and cognitivism) which helped motivate expressivism\nin the first place? Third, can the realist avoid these familiar\nproblems equally well by accepting deflationary moral\npropositions?\n\nThe first question is examined in the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs non-cognitivism.\n We will briefly discuss the other two.\n\nConsider, for example, the Humean argument facing realism, a crude\nversion of which is as follows. If there are moral propositions, then\nmoral judgments are beliefs in moral propositions. But moral judgments\nare intrinsically motivational states, whereas beliefs are not. So,\nthere are no moral propositions. Of course, this argument may be\ncriticized as relying on an overly strong internalism, or a\nsimple-minded speculative psychology. But even when improved, it is\nnot immediately clear how accepting deflationism about moral\npropositions will help the expressivist solve the problem. The moral\npropositions exist, and so why can\u2019t they be believed\nindependently of having any intrinsically motivating states? How can\ntheir deflationary character help defuse this question? Moreover,\nsuppose that deflationism did help the expressivist cope with this\nproblem. Why couldn\u2019t the realist follow suit with her own\nappeal to deflationism?\n\nBlackburn\u2019s supervenience argument is a second argument against\nrealism. Blackburn formulated the argument in terms of moral\nproperties, as follows. If there are moral properties, then they\nsupervene on non-moral properties as a matter of conceptual necessity.\nThat is, in every conceptually possible world, if two things share all\nnon-moral properties, they share all moral properties. But if there\nare moral properties, the pattern of supervenience is not itself\nconceptually necessary. So, even if all \\(P\\)s are \\(M\\)s in fact,\nthere is some conceptually possible world in which there is a \\(P\\)\nwhich isn\u2019t an \\(M\\). Blackburn\u2019s question is this: if\nmoral properties can come apart from non-moral properties\nacross worlds, why can\u2019t they come apart from them\nwithin worlds? That is: what explains the \u201cban on mixed\nworlds\u201d? A similar problem can be formulated for truth as a\nfeature of moral propositions. What explains the ban on conceptually\npossible worlds in which one moral proposition \\(\\ltb x\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\)\nis true, while another moral proposition \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\) is\nfalse, but in which all relevant non-moral propositions \\(\\ltb x\\) is\n\\(P\\gtb\\) and \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(P\\gtb\\) are alike in truth-value? What\nis not immediately clear is, first, how deflationary moral\npropositions will prove useful to the expressivist in answering this\nquestion, and second, how, supposing they do prove useful, why they\nwon\u2019t prove equally useful to the realist.\n\nWhat the expressivist seeks is a conception of propositions (and of\ntruths, facts, and beliefs) substantive enough to explain and validate\nour ordinary realist-seeming discourse but deflationary enough to\navoid the traditional problems for realism. Whether it is possible to\nnavigate the two is the subject of intense scrutiny in contemporary\nmetaethics.",
