Discussing the main\npoints of doctrine before approaching their particular subjects\nis\u2014in addition to references to Laozi and the Daode\njing, already noted above\u2014the other main way used in Daoist\ntexts to declare their affiliation to Daoism.\n\nIn the Daoist view, the Dao is both the \u201cultimateless\u201d (or\n\u201climitless\u201d, wuji, a term akin in meaning to\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201cinfinite\u201d) and the \u201cgreat\nultimate\u201d (taiji). In the first sense, the Dao is\ndevoid of definition, determination, form, name, attributes, and\nqualities. Yet, it comprises all definitions,\ndeterminations, forms, etc., none of which could exist outside it.\nFrom the perspective of the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\n(wanwu, the objects and phenomena that exist and occur in the\nmanifested world), all that can be said is that they come about\n\u201cwithin\u201d the Dao, but the Dao is not the same as any of\nthem, or else it would be subject to, and limited by, their\nindividuality, form, change, and transitoriness. When the Dao, in the\nsecond sense, is understood as the \u201cgreat ultimate\u201d, it is\nseen as the supreme principle of Unity. This Unity, or Oneness, is\nmeant as the transcendent unity both beyond multiplicity (1 as the\norigin of numbers, but itself not a number) and as the origin of the\nmany (1 as the first number).\n\nIn the Daode jing, these two aspects of the Dao correspond to\nthe Dao as \u201cabsolute\u201d and as \u201cmother\u201d. The two\nmain ontologic and cosmogonic stages respectively prior and posterior\nto the creatio continua of the cosmos are often referred to\nas xiantian (precelestial, \u201cbefore Heaven\u201d) and\nhoutian (postcelestial, \u201cafter Heaven\u201d).\n",
