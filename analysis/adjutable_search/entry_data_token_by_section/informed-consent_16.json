    "main_text": "Voluntary consent || Coercion\n5.1 Coercion\n\nVoluntary consent is usually thought incompatible with\n coercion,\n which philosophers define, roughly, as a threat to make someone\nseriously worse off than she is or should be, unless she consents\n(Wertheimer 1987). Nonetheless, the prevailing medical ethos tends to\ntreat more cases as cases of coercion than this philosophical\ndefinition would suggest. A threat to cause even slight pain unless a\npatient acquiesces would be taken to invalidate her consent. It would\ndo so even if the patient and the physician have common knowledge that\nit would not make her seriously worse off and so, that it would not\namount to coercion. A threat to deny preventative intervention that is\nnot otherwise owed\u2014which therefore rarely amounts to a threat to\nmake the patient worse off than she is or should be\u2014unless the\npatient consents to an intervention would also be frowned upon.\n\nHow much do \u201cimplicit threats\u201d count as threats? Imagine a\npractitioner who asks her own patient to participate in a study that\nthe practitioner runs, and the patient fears that care would suffer if\nhe declines, without the practitioner actually saying so. When the\npatient\u2019s fear is well-founded, or even intentionally instilled\nby the practitioner, the norm has been to consider consent invalid.\nThis clearly makes sense if what makes coercion problematic is\n(unjust) curtailment of options. However, even when the fear is\nunfounded and unintended, the hierarchy and the power inequality of\nthe physician-patient relationship are often still thought to make\nsuch consent involuntary. The thought is that someone\u2019s options\ncount in this context as curtailed even when what curtails them is\nuncertainty and the patient\u2019s own pessimism.\n",
