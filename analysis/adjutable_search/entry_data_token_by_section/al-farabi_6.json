    "main_text": "Ethics and Politics\n7. Ethics and Politics\n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee dealt little with ethics, but part of the\ncontroversy stems from what we may know of his lost Commentary on\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, his main foray in Ethics. Despite the\nexistence of an Arabic translation of Aristotle\u2019s\nNicomachean Ethics (ed. by A. A. Akasoy & A. Fidora with\nan English translation by D.M. Dunlop, 2005), we see few signs of its\ninfluence in al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s extant writings. Yet,\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wrote on it a lost commentary, to which\nthree Andalusian philosophers, Ibn B\u00e2jja, Ibn Tufayl and\nAverroes, refer. According to them, therein\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee denied the immortality of the human soul\nas well as the possibility of any conjunction with the active or Agent\nIntellect, considering them tall tales. Yet, in many other works, such\nas the Treatise on the Intellect, the Opinions, and\nthe Political Regime, he claims that this conjunction is\npossible and constitutes ultimate happiness. If what the Andalusian\nphilosophers report, presents an accurate reading of this lost text,\nthen the disciples of Leo Strauss may have some justification in reading\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works as divided between exoteric\nand esoteric ones since the content of this work would contradict\nviews in more popular texts, such as the Opinions in which\nthe Neo-Platonic influence is the strongest. Neo-Platonic metaphysics,\nconstrued mainly as the descent and emanation, would provide an\nexoteric view good for a more general public, but denied in the\nesoteric works reserved for an intellectual elite. Chaim\nMeir Neria (2013) published two quotations from this commentary (in\nHebrew translation and with English translation) that have been newly\ndiscovered and gave a summary of the issue. \n\nThough we do not have any ethical text from\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee relying mainly on the Nicomachean\nEthics, Marwan Rashed (2019) discussed his ethical outlook in relying on the Attainment of Happiness. We do have a brief ethical treatise in the tradition of\nHellenistic ethics, Directing Attention to the Way of\nHappiness or Tanb\u00eeh (not to be confused with the\nAttainment of Happiness or Tahs\u00eel), which is\npropaedeutic to the study of philosophy proper and of logic in\nparticular (English translation in McGinnis & Reisman\u2019s\nClassical Arabic Philosophy (2007: 104\u201320)). This\ntreatise (1) incites the student to curb his passions in order to be\nable to focus on his studies and (2) encourages him to begin the study\nof philosophy and of logic in particular. It is obviously\npre-philosophical and serves as introduction to a Farabian elementary\nintroduction to logic The Utterances Employed in Logic\n(Mahdi\u2019s edition, 1968;\nno English translation). Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nconception of truly philosophical ethics remains unclear as we have so\nlittle extended textual basis to establish it. Janne Mattila (2017) compared the philosopher\u2019s ethical progression in al-Farabi and in al-Razi. Ethics, when treating of our relations with other people, implies intersubjectivity, but al-Farabi, though not treating it much in what concerns this life, offers an interesting picture of it in the afterlife (Druart, 2017).\n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2bi\u2019s political philosophy fared much better\nand has attracted much attention from many scholars. According to\nThe Enumeration, it also includes kal\u00e2m, i.e.,\nnon-philosophical theology, and fiqh or Islamic law. Many\nFarabian political works have been translated into English. Muhsin\nMahdi translated three of them in Philosophy of Plato and\nAristotle (1969b; reprint 2001), which contains The Attainment\nof Happiness, The Philosophy of Plato, and The\nPhilosophy of Aristotle. These three texts form a trilogy.\nCharles E. Butterworth in, The Political Writings, vol. I\n(2001), translated Selected Aphorisms, part V of The\nEnumeration of the Sciences, Book of Religion, and\nThe Harmonization of the Two Opinions of the Two Sages: Plato the\nDivine and Aristotle and in vol. II (2015), Political\nRegime and Summary of Plato\u2019s Laws. \n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not take inspiration from\nAristotle\u2019s Politics (a text which does not seem to\nhave been translated or summarized into Arabic) but rather takes some\ninspiration from Plato\u2019s Republic and Laws,\neven if his access to these two texts may have been rather limited, as\nthere is some doubt that a full Arabic translation of them ever\nexisted. Though Averroes wrote a commentary of sort on the\nRepublic, its brevity and content do not testify to an\nin-depth knowledge of the whole text. Yet, David C. Reisman (2004)\ndiscovered an Arabic translation of a single passage from the\nRepublic (VI, 506d3\u2013509b10). As for the Laws,\nwe certainly have al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Summary of\nPlato\u2019s Laws, but this text (Arabic ed. by Th.-A. Druart\n(1998) and English translation by Butterworth, in The Political\nWritings, II, (2015: 129\u201373)) is very brief and covers only\nthe first eight books. Whether this summary relies on a full or\npartial Arabic translation of the Laws or on a translation of\na Greek summary, possibly that of Galen (lost in Greek), at this stage\ncannot be determined. For the latest status quaestionis about\nArabic translations of Plato\u2019s works and their paucity, see\nDimitri Gutas (2012). Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s own brief\nPhilosophy of Plato does not exhibit detailed knowledge of\nPlato\u2019s works.\n\nThough al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s political philosophy takes\nsome inspiration from Plato, it much transforms it in important and\ninteresting ways to reflect a very different world and adapt it to it.\nInstead of a monolingual and monoethnic city state,\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee envisions a vast multicultural,\nmultilingual, and multireligious empire (Alexander Orwin, 2017). He also sees the necessity to\nmake of the philosopher king a philosopher prophet ruler. \n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Summary of Plato\u2019s\nLaws caused much controversy, which Butterworth narrates in the\nintroduction to his translation (2015: 97\u2013127). In 1995 Joshua\nParens, making use of a draft of Druart\u2019s edition, published\nMetaphysics as Rhetoric: Alfarabi\u2019s Summary of\nPlato\u2019s \u201cLaws\u201d. He argued that\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes metaphysics, or maybe more exactly\nspecial metaphysics or the Neo-Platonic descent, i.e., what treats of\nimmaterial beings rather than ontology, as a form of rhetoric, and\nthat such was already the case for Plato. Whether or not we should\nread Plato as Parens and other Straussians claim\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee understood him is a hotly debated\nquestion. \n\nMarwan Rashed (2009) introduced a new element in the controversy by\nputting into serious doubt the authenticity of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Harmonization of the Opinions\nof the Two Sages. Following an Alexandrian tradition, this\ntreatise (for Butterworth\u2019s 2001 English translation, see above)\nargues that, despite a series of issues on which Aristotle and Plato\nseem to contradict each other, there is remarkable harmony between\nthese two sages, as one can easily resolve such contradictions. This\ntext also refers (1) to the so-called Aristotle\u2019s\nTheology, which in fact Aristotle never wrote, as it derives from\nPlotinus, and (2) to Proclus Arabus, as Peter Adamson (forthcoming)\nshows. On the other hand, Cecilia Martini Bonadeo, in her 2008\ncritical edition and Italian translation of this text\n(al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, L\u2019armonia delle opinioni dei\ndue sapienti, il divino Platone e Aristotele), argued for the\nFarabian authenticity of this text.  Whether one accepts the Farabian\nauthorship of this text affects one\u2019s understanding of the whole\ncontroversy of how to read al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, as well as\none\u2019s understanding of the relationship between his\nAristotelianism and his Neo-Platonism. It also makes the whole issue\nof the relationship between his metaphysics and his political\nphilosophy still more complex and convoluted.\n\nAmong the most recent developments, expressed in various articles, on\nthe Straussian side, let us point to Butterworth\u2019s \u201cHow to\nRead Alfarabi\u201d (2013) and \u201cAlfarabi\u2019s Goal:\nPolitical Philosophy, Not Political Theology\u201d (2011) to which I\nreferred earlier. On the other side, we can point to Charles\nGenequand\u2019s \u201cTh\u00e9ologie et philosophie. La\nprovidence chez al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee et\nl\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de l\u2019Harmonie des opinions des\ndeux sages\u201d (2012), which objects to M. Rashed\u2019s\ndeclaring the Harmonization inauthentic, and his (2013)\n\u201cLe Platon d\u2019al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u201d. Amor\nCherni (2015), on the other hand, published a book on the\nrelation between politics and metaphysics in\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (La cit\u00e9 et ses opinions:\nPolitique et m\u00e9taphysique ches Ab\u00fb Nasr\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee), which includes an appendix\nrejecting the authenticity of The Harmonization. \n",
