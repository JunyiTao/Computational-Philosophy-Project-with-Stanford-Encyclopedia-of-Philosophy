    "main_text": "The Shape of the Traditional Pornography Debate || Conservative Arguments for Censorship\n2.1 Conservative Arguments for Censorship\n\nUntil comparatively recently, the main opposition to pornography\ncame from moral and religious conservatives, who argue that pornography\nshould be banned because its sexually explicit content is obscene and\nmorally corrupting. By \u201cpornography,\u201d conservatives usually\nmean simply sexually explicit material (either pictures or words),\nsince conservatives typically view all such material as obscene.\n\nAccording to conservatives, the sexually explicit content of\npornography is an affront to decent family and religious values and\ndeeply offensive to a significant portion of citizens who hold these\nvalues. The consumption of pornography is also bad for society. It\nundermines and destabilizes the moral fabric of a decent and stable\nsociety by encouraging sexual promiscuity, deviant sexual practices and\nother attitudes and behaviour that threaten traditional family and\nreligious institutions and which conservatives regard as intrinsically\nmorally wrong. Furthermore, pornography is bad for those who consume\nit, corrupting their character and preventing them from leading a good\nand worthwhile life in accordance with family and religious values.\n\nAccording to conservatives, the state is justified in using its\ncoercive power to uphold and enforce a community\u2019s moral convictions\nand to prevent citizens from engaging in activities that offend\nprevailing community standards of morality and decency (e.g., Devlin\n1968; Sandel 1984.) This position is sometimes called \u201clegal\nmoralism.\u201d Governments also have a responsibility to prevent\ncitizens from harming themselves. This is true even where the citizen\nis not a child (who may not yet be competent to make responsible\njudgements for themselves about what is in their own best interests),\nbut a mature adult who is voluntarily engaged in an activity which they\njudge to be desirable and which causes no harm to others. The view that\nthe state is entitled to interfere with the freedom of mentally\ncompetent adults against their will for their own good is often called\n\u201clegal paternalism.\u201d\n\nConservatives therefore think that it is entirely legitimate for the\nstate to prohibit consenting adults from publishing and viewing\npornography, even in private, in order to protect the moral health of\nwould-be consumers and of society as a whole (Baird and Rosenbaum\n1991).\n",
