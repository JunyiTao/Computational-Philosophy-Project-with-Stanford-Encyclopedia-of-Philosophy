    "main_text": "Content, Force, and How Saying Can Make It So || The Independence of Force and Content\n2.1 The Independence of Force and Content\n\nLet us return, then, to an elucidation of our distinction between what\na speaker says and the force of her utterance. A grammatical sentence\ncomposed of meaningful words is commonly thought to express a\n\u201ccontent,\u201d which is determined by what that sentence\nliterally means together with features of the context of\nutterance. Suppose I say to someone in a crowded subway, \u201cYou\u2019re\nstanding on my foot.\u201d I am most likely trying to convey the\nmessage that he should move. However, what I literally say is only\nthat the addressee in question is standing on my foot. This is the\ncontent of my utterance. Many if not most utterances of grammatical\nsentences composed of meaningful words express more than those\nsentences\u2019 contents. Pragmaticians, however, commonly distinguish\ncontent from other aspects of meaning conveyed by an utterance. On\nthis way of thinking, two intertranslatable sentences of different\nlanguages will express the same content, and certain transformations\nof a sentence within a language are commonly thought to express the\nsame content. Thus, \u2018Mary saw John,\u2019 and \u2018John was\nseen by Mary,\u2019 will express the same content even if a speaker\u2019s\nuse of one rather than another of these will carry a distinctive\nsuggestion. For indicative sentences, such contents are typically\ncalled Propositions. (In what follows I will capitalize this\nterm to signify that it is in part technical.) Propositions, then, are\nthe contents of indicative sentences, are what such sentences express,\nand, further, are often thought to be the primary bearers of truth\nvalue.\n\nIllocutionary force and semantic content are often taken to be\ndistinct from one another, not just in the way that your left and\nright hand are distinct, but rather by virtue of falling into\ndifferent categories. Stenius 1967 elucidates this distinction, noting\nthat in chemical parlance a radical is a group of atoms\nnormally incapable of independent existence, whereas a functional\ngroup is the grouping of those atoms in a compound that is\nresponsible for certain of that compound\u2019s properties. Analogously, a\nProposition is itself communicatively inert. For instance, merely\nexpressing the Proposition that it is snowing is not to make a move in\na \u201clanguage game\u201d. Rather, such a move is only made by\nputting forth a Proposition with an illocutionary force such as\nassertion, conjecture, command, etc. The chemical analogy gains\nfurther support from the fact that just as a chemist might isolate\nradicals held in common among various compounds, the student of\nlanguage may isolate a common element held among \u2018Is the door\nshut?\u2019, \u2018Shut the door!\u2019, and \u2018The door is\nshut\u2019. This common element is the Proposition that the door is\nshut, queried in the first sentence, commanded to be made true in the\nsecond, and asserted in the third. According to the chemical analogy,\nthen:\n\nIllocutionary force : Propositional content :: functional group :\nradical\n\nIn light of this analogy we may see, following Stenius, that just\nas the grouping of a set of atoms is not itself another atom or set of\natoms, so too the forwarding of a Proposition with a particular\nillocutionary force is not itself a further component of Propositional\ncontent.\n\nEncouraged by the chemical analogy, a central tenet in the study of\nspeech acts is that content may remain fixed while force\nvaries. The force of\nan utterance also underdetermines its content: Just from the fact that\na speaker has made a promise, we cannot deduce what she has promised\nto do. For these reasons, students of speech acts contend that a given\ncommunicative act may be analyzed into two components: force and\ncontent. While semantics studies the contents of communicative acts,\npragmatics studies their force.\n\nThe force/content distinction also finds parallels in our\nunderstanding of mentality. Speech acts are not only moves in a\n\u201clanguage game.\u201d They also often purport to express of\nstates of mind with analogous structural properties. An assertion that\nit is snowing purports to express the speaker\u2019s belief that it is\nsnowing. A promise to read Middlemarch purports to express\nthe speaker\u2019s intention to read Middlemarch. We find evidence\nfor these relationships in the fact that it is in some sense absurd to\nsay, \u2018It\u2019s snowing, but I don\u2019t believe that it is,\u2019 and\n\u2018I promise to read Middlemarch, but I have no intention\nof doing \nso.\u2019[6] \nFurther, just as we may distinguish between\nan asserting and what is asserted (the so-called\n\u201cing/ed ambiguity\u201d for verbs such as\n\u2018assert\u2019), and a promising from what is\npromised, we may also distinguish between a state of\nbelieving and what is believed, and a state or act of intending and\nwhat is intended. Searle 1983 delineates structural analogies between\nspeech acts and the mental states they express. Pendlebury 1986\nsuccinctly explains the merits of this approach.\n\nIn spite of these structural analogies, we may still wonder why an\nelucidation of the notion of force is important for a theory of\ncommunication. That A is an important component of\ncommunication, and that A underdetermines B, do not\njustify the conclusion that B is an important component of\ncommunication. Content also underdetermines the decibel level at which\nwe speak but this fact does not justify adding decibel level to our\nrepertoire of core concepts for pragmatics or the philosophy of\nlanguage. Why should force be thought any more worthy of admission to\nthis set of core concepts than decibel level? One reason for an\nasymmetry in our treatment of force and decibel level is that the\nformer, but not the latter, seems to be a component of speaker\nmeaning: Force is a feature not of what is said but of how what\nis said is meant; decibel level, by contrast, is a feature at most of\nthe way in which something is said. This point is developed in Section\n5 below.\n\nWe have spoken thus far as if the contents of speech acts must be\nPropositions, and indeed Searle routinely analyzes speech acts as\nhaving the form F(p) (e.g., 1975, p. 344), where\n\u2018F\u2019 is the force component and\n\u2018p\u2019 the Propositional content component. However,\nin the last two decades linguistic semantics has developed formal\nrepresentations of contents for the two other major grammatical moods\nbesides the indicative, namely the interrogative and the\nimperative. On the strength of the analyses of Hamblin (1958), Bell\n(1975), Pendlebury (1986) and others, one strategy for the semantics\nof interrogatives is to construe them as expressing sets of\npropositions rather than a single proposition, where each element of\nthe putative set is a complete answer to the question at issue. Thus\nthe content expressed by \u2018How many doors are shut?\u2019 will\nbe {<No doors are shut>, <One door is shut>, \u2026}\nwhere the ellipsis will be filled by as many other Propositions as it\nis reasonable to interpret the questioner as asking after. Call such a\nset an Interrogative. A complete answer to an Interrogative\nis an element of the set by which it is defined; a partial answer is a\nsubset of that set containing two or more members, as would naturally\nbe expressed by the sentence \u2018Between two and four doors are\nshut.\u2019 On the present conceptualization, just as we may\ndistinguish between expressing and asserting a Propositional content,\nwe may also distinguish between expressing an Interrogative and asking\na question. One merely expresses an Interrogative in such an utterance\nas, \u2018John wonders how many doors are shut.\u2019 In fact, a\nsingle utterance may express two Interrogatives while asking neither,\nas in \u2018How many doors are shut will depend on how many customers\nare trying on clothes.\u2019 Asking a question is no less substantial\na conversational move than is making an assertion.\n\nSimilarly, work by Hamblin (1987), Belnap (1990), Portner (2004) and\nothers suggests semantic analyses for sentences in the imperative\nmood: on one approach an imperative expresses a property, and when one\nspeaker issues an imperative that her addressee accepts, that property\nis added to her \u201cto do list\u201d, itself a parameter of what\nwe will later describe as conversational score (Section 7).\n\nIn light of the above liberalization of the notion of sentential\ncontent to accommodate the contents of non-indicative sentences, we\nmay rephrase Stenius\u2019s chemical analogy as follows:\n\n\tIllocutionary force : sentential content :: functional group :\n\tradical\n\n\nwith the understanding that different types of sentential content will\ncorrespond to the different grammatical moods. This refined analogy\nwould in turn require there to be different types of\nradical.[7]\n",
