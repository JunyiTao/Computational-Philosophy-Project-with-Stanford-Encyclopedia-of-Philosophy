    "main_text": "The Aharonov-Bohm Effect and Field Holonomies\n10. The Aharonov-Bohm Effect and Field Holonomies\n\nAharonov and Bohm (1959) drew attention to the quantum mechanical\nprediction that an interference pattern due to a beam of charged\nparticles could be produced or altered by the presence of a constant\nmagnetic field in a region from which the particles were excluded.\nThis effect has since been experimentally demonstrated. At first\nsight, the Aharonov-Bohm effect seems to involve action at a distance.\nIt seems clear that the (electro-)magnetic field acts on the particles\nsince it affects the interference pattern they produce; and this must\nbe action at a distance since the particles pass through a region from\nwhich that field is absent. But alternative accounts of the phenomenon\nare possible which portray it rather as a manifestation of (strong)\n nonseparability\n (Healey 1997). There need be no action at a distance if the behavior\nboth of the charged particles and of electromagnetism are nonseparable\nprocesses. While such a treatment of electromagnetism (and other gauge\ntheories) is increasingly common in physics, to treat the motion of\nthe charged particles as a nonseparable process is to endorse a\nparticular position on how quantum mechanics is to be interpreted.\n\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics that ascribes a nonlocalized\nposition to a charged particle on its way through the apparatus is\ncommitted to a violation of\n spatiotemporal separability\n in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, since the particle\u2019s passage\nconstitutes a nonseparable process. To see why the electromagnetism\nthat acts on the particles during their passage may also be taken to\nbe nonseparable it is necessary to consider contemporary\nrepresentations of electromagnetism in terms of neither fields nor\nvector potentials.\n\nFollowing Wu and Yang\u2019s (1975) analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect, it has become common to consider vacuum electromagnetism to be\ncompletely and nonredundantly described neither by the electromagnetic\nfield, nor by its vector potential, but rather by the so-called Dirac\nphase factor: \n\n\\[ \\exp[(ie/\\hbar) \\oint_C A_{\\mu}(x^{\\mu}.dx^{\\mu}] \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A_{\\mu}\\) is the electromagnetic potential at spacetime point\n\\(x^{\\mu}\\), e is the particles\u2019 charge, and\nthe integral is taken over each closed loop C in\nspacetime. This can be seen as an instance of the more general notion\nof the holonomy of a closed curve, a notion that has come to the fore\nin contemporary formulations of gauge theories including\nelectromagnetism in terms of fiber bundles (Healey (2007)). Applied to\nthe Aharonov-Bohm case, this means that the constant magnetic field is\naccompanied by an association of a phase factor \\(S(C)\\) with all\nclosed curves C in space, where \\(S(C)\\) is defined\nby \n\n\\[ S(C) = \\exp[-(ie/\\hbar) \\oint_C \\mathbf{A(r).}d\\mathbf{r}] \\]\n\n\n(where \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the magnetic vector potential at\npoint \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) of space). This approach has the advantage that\nsince \\(S(C)\\) is gauge-invariant, it may readily be considered a\nphysically real quantity. Moreover, the effects of electromagnetism in\nthe field-free region may be attributed to the fact that \\(S(C)\\) is\nnonvanishing for certain closed curves C within\nthat region. But it is significant that, unlike the magnetic field and\nits potential, \\(S(C)\\) is not defined at each point of space at each\nmoment of time.\n\nCan \\(S(C)\\) at some time be taken to represent an intrinsic property\nof a region of space corresponding to the curve C?\nThere are two difficulties with this suggestion. The first is that the\npresence of the quantity e in the definition of\n\\(S(C)\\) appears to indicate that \\(S(C)\\) rather codes the effect of\nelectromagnetism on objects with that specific charge. If in fact\nall charges are multiples of some minimal value e,\nthen this would no longer be a problem: the value of\n\\(S(C)\\) for this minimal charge could then be viewed as representing\nan intrinsic property of a region of space corresponding to the curve\nC. If not, one could rather take \n\n\\[ I(C) = \\oint_C \\mathbf{A(r).}d\\mathbf{r} \\]\n\n\nto represent an intrinsic property of C. The second\ndifficulty is that closed curves do not correspond uniquely to regions\nof space: e.g., circling the region in which there is a magnetic field\ntwice on the same circle will produce a different curve from circling\nit once. But this does not prevent one from taking \\(S(C)\\) at some\ntime to represent an intrinsic property of a loop\u2014the oriented\nregion of space traced out by a closed curve C that\nintersects itself only at its end-point.\n\nOnce these difficulties have been handled, it is indeed possible to\nconsider electromagnetism in the Aharonov-Bohm effect as faithfully\nrepresented at a time by a set of intrinsic properties of loops in\nspace (or more generally space-time). But if one does so, then\nelectromagnetism itself manifests (strong)\n nonseparability.\n For these intrinsic properties do not supervene on any assignment of\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in the\nregion concerned, nor even in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those\npoints. Whether the magnetic field remains constant or changes, the\nassociated electromagnetism constitutes a nonseparable process, and so\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect violates\n spatiotemporal separability.\n If the motion of the particles through the apparatus is a\nnonseparable process, then it is possible to account for the \\(AB\\)\neffect in terms of a purely local interaction between electromagnetism\nand this process. For the particles effectively traverse loops traced\nout by closed curves C on their nonlocalized\n\u201ctrajectories\u201d, and so they interact with electromagnetism\nprecisely where this is defined.\n\nAssuming it exhibits nonseparability, does the Aharonov-Bohm effect\ninvolve some kind of holism? The states of the particles need not be\nentangled with each other. But the state of the field may be thought\nto be holistic, in so far as the electromagnetic properties of loops\ndo not supervene on properties (such as electric and magnetic field\nstrengths) at the points that make up those loops. Since these are\nclassical fields, the Aharonov-Bohm effect may be taken to demonstrate\nholism as well as nonseparability even in classical physics.\nHowever, a loop may also be thought of as traced out by a curve\ncomposed by \u201cstringing together\u201d a set of curves that\ntrace out smaller loops, and removing segments traversed by two such\ncurves in opposite directions. In that case, in a simply-connected\nregion, the holonomy properties of any loop will be determined by\nthose of an arbitrary set of smaller loops that compose it in this\nway. But when spacetime is not simply connected, there are loops that\ncannot be decomposed in this way: e.g. the loop that encompasses\n\u201cthe hole\u201d in space cannot be further decomposed.\n\nMyrvold (2011) interprets this result as saying that Weak Separability\n(what he calls Global Patchy Separability) fails for non-simply\nconnected spacetimes, even though locally\u2014over simply-connected\npatches\u2014separability holds. Moreover, he here sees a marked\ndistinction between the holonomy and the field formalism for gauge\ntheories: in which supposedly separability always holds.\n\nBut Gomes (2021) effaces this distinction: he argues that a field\nformalism maintains separability, but only at the cost of dealing with\ngauge variant field variables. Once we restrict attention to\nthe gauge-invariant quantities, the nonseparability\nillustrated above (using the holonomy variables) is restored.\nMoreover, he argues that only in a vacuum is nonseparability\nconditional on the topology of spacetime. In the presence of charged\nmatter, there may be gauge-invariant quantities that cannot be\ndecomposed into smaller patches, even for simply-connected regions.\nAnd this is easy to illustrate: suppose that, instead of the phase\nfactor \\(S(C)\\), for a closed loop C, we write \\(S(I)\\) for an open\nsegment I, that begins at point x and ends\nat point y. For a (Klein-Gordon) charged scalar\nfield \\(\\varphi\\) that vanishes everywhere except at small\nneighborhoods \\(\\nu_x, \\nu_y\\), of x and y,\nthe function:\n\n\\[\n \\bar\\varphi(x)S(I)\\varphi(y)\n\\]\n\n\nis gauge-invariant, and it cannot be further decomposed into\nquantities with support on patches that do not include the entirety of\n\\(I. \\)For instance, if there are two patches, each containing either\n\\(\\nu_x\\) or \\(\\nu_y\\), then that patch has insufficient charges to\ncomplete \\(S(I)\\) into a gauge-invariant function. This example is in\nline with the physics literature, which largely takes gauge-invariance\n(and in particular the existence of a generalized Gauss constraint),\nto signal some general type of nonlocality (cf. Strocchi (2013, Ch.\n7)).\n",
