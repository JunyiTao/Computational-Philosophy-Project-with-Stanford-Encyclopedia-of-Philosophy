Summary of Problems for Logicism\n\nWe see from the foregoing discussion that there are various problems\nto be faced by extant versions of logicism or neo-logicism in the\nliterature. The reader who remains mindful of them will be in a\nposition to examine the details of any proposed new neo-logicist\naccount with a more critically focused eye.\n\nSome of these problems confront any version of logicism, and their\nsolutions might be required as \u2018conditions of adequacy\u2019 on\nthe latter. Others among these problems arise only in response to the\nparticular methods or posits employed by the version of logicism under\nconsideration. The following problems appear to have loomed large in\nthe foregoing discussion.\n\nFrege\u2019s \u2018conceptualization\nproblem\u2019\n\nHow do we apprehend numbers, if we are persuaded that arithmetic is\nnot grounded in Kant\u2019s \u201cpure form of intuition of\ntime\u201d? As Frege put it in Grundlagen \u00a762:\n\u201cHow \u2026 are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have\nany ideas or intuitions of them?\u201d\nFrege\u2019s \u2018Julius Caesar problem\u2019\n\nHow can one show that, given a would-be logicist account of the nature\nof numbers, Julius Caesar is not a number? More generally:\nhow can one show, on such an account, that no number is a concrete\nindividual?\nThe \u2018applicability problem\u2019\n\nCan the logicist account for (i) how natural numbers may be\napplied in counting finite collections, and (ii) how real\nnumbers may be applied in measuring continuously varying magnitudes\nsuch as lengths, periods of time, etc.?\nThe \u2018inclusion problem\u2019\n\nHow does one show that the natural number \\(n\\) is the very\nsame abstract object as the integer \\(n\\), the\nrational number \\(n\\), and the real number \\(n\\)?\n(See footnote 40.)\nThe \u2018abstraction problem\u2019\n\nWhat is the correct form for number-abstraction principles (to be\nespoused by those who hold that numbers are logical\nabstracta)?\nThe \u2018analyticity problem\u2019\n\nCan one demonstrate that one\u2019s chosen number-abstraction\nprinciples are analytic?\nThe \u2018existence problem\u2019\n\nCan Logic commit one to the existence of any thing, or kind of\n thing?[51]\nThe \u2018infinity problem\u2019\n\nIs the logicist permitted to simply postulate an Axiom of\nInfinity, to the effect that there are infinitely many things (perhaps\nof a certain kind)?\nThe \u2018demarcation problem\u2019\n\nWhat makes something a logical constant? Which notions commonly held\nto be mathematical can actually be defined, implicitly or otherwise,\nin a properly formulated Logic for logicism?[52]\n\u2018Bad\n Company\u2019,[53]\n or \u2018Embarrassment of Riches\u2019\n\nSome abstraction principles are inconsistent. Yet others, though\nindividually consistent, are mutually inconsistent. How then can we\nknow, of any proposed abstraction principle, whether we should accept\nit?\n\u2018Theoretical Invariance\u2019\n\nNatural numbers are universally applicable; they enjoy their\narithmetical properties and enter into their arithmetical relations\nnecessarily, independently of what other kinds of things there might\nbe, and of how these things might be. So abstraction principles for\nnatural numbers should be consistent with any consistent theory about\nany domain of discourse. Are they?\n\n",
