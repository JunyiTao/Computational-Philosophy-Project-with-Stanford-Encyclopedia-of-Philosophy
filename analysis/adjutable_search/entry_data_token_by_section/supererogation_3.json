    "main_text": "Three Views of Supererogation: Problems of Justification || Anti-supererogationism\n3.1 Anti-supererogationism\n\nThe denial of supererogation is basically associated with the\nrejection of the idea of the two faces of morality. Normativity is one\nand cannot be split into two levels, that of the good (the desirable,\nthe ideal, the recommended) and that of the required (the obligatory,\nthe prescribed). What \u201cought to be the case\u201d also\n\u201cought to be done.\u201d A possible good state of\naffairs creates a reason for action. Furthermore, the fact that human\nbeings, due to their limitations and flawed character, often fail to\nlive up to the standards of the ideally good behavior is a deplorable\nfact that does not undermine the normative power of the moral\ndemands.\n\nThis \u201cgood-ought tie-up\u201d is a theoretically attractive\nprinciple: whatever is good, ought to be done. If an action is good,\nthen there must be reasons for doing it. If it is the best possible\naction, the reasons for doing it are conclusive, that is outweighing\nall other reasons for not doing it (or doing something else). Failing\nto do the best action cannot therefore be immune from blame or\ncondemnation. Or, in other words, doing the best is always obligatory,\nnever optional. Supererogation is impossible (Moore 1948, New 1974,\nFeldman 1986, Pybus 1982).\n\nThe principled denial of supererogation was central in the theological\nconception of Lutherans and Calvinists. The demands of God are so\nextensive that human beings have not the slightest chance of ever\nsatisfying them, let alone going beyond them. But there are also\nnon-theological adherents to this idea of the\n\u201ctotalitarian\u201d dominion of duty. Kantian ethics is based\non the general idea of an all-encompassing moral law and\nconceives of duty as the only expression of moral value in human\naction. Universalizability of the maxim of action and acting from the\nsense of duty (or respect for the law) as a motive are two\nconstitutive hallmarks of moral action according to Kant. But the two\nare incompatible with the nature of supererogatory action, which is\noptional and personal on the one hand and not motivated by the\nsubjection to the moral law on the other. Classical utilitarianism may\nalso be interpreted as denying any space for supererogation. If\npromoting the overall good in the world is the fundamental principle\nof action, there can be no (non-utilitarian) exemption from the duty\nto do so. Both Kantians and utilitarians are highly suspicious of acts\nof great personal self-sacrifice (typical of some paradigm examples of\nsupererogation). For Kant they may reflect moral self-indulgence and\nvanity unbound by the moral law or even be a violation of one\u2019s\nduties to oneself (Kant 1949, Timmermann 2005). For utilitarians such\nacts may end up decreasing the overall happiness in the world (since\nthe loss to the agent could outweigh the gain for the beneficiary,\neither in the specific individual case, or when adopted as a general\nrule of behavior). It should, however, be noted that there are serious\nattempts to interpret Kant\u2019s theory as leaving some room for\nsupererogation (Hill 1971, Eisenberg 1966, Heyd 1983) and there are\nutilitarians like Mill who specifically hail the value of\nnon-obligatory meritorious action (Mill 1969). Furthermore, the idea\nof \u201csatisficing\u201d (rather than optimizing or maximizing),\ni.e. aiming at the good enough rather than at the best, is a\ncontemporary version of utilitarianism which leaves ample room for\nsupererogation (Slote 1989, Vessel 2010).\n\nThe denial of the value of supererogatory action also appeals to its\nincompatibility with the fundamental requirement of impartiality.\nActions beyond the call of duty are not expected of everybody on an\nequal basis and are not bestowed on everybody in an impartial way. In\nother words, there are no general rules regarding either the\nagent or the recipient of supererogatory conduct. Thus, no general\nspecification as to who deserves or is entitled to be the recipient of\nsupererogatory giving can be formulated, and those who, for instance,\nare not given charity cannot complain for being discriminated against.\nFurthermore, some philosophers have noted (Wolf 1982) that despite the\ntraditional aura associated with saintly action, \u201cmoral\nsaints\u201d are not very attractive human characters and most of us\ndo not take them as role models for the way we lead our lives. They\nare fanatically one-track minded in their pursuit of moral ideals,\ntending to disparage the more personal (non-moral) values which we\ntend to appreciate in ourselves and in others (such as achieving\nathletic excellence or dedicating one\u2019s life to music). We feel\nsimilar repugnance towards a person who always goes beyond her duty as\nwe feel towards the person who never does anything beyond what is\nstrictly required of her.\n\nDespite its theoretical and moral purity, the anti-supererogationist\nview is open to criticism. The good-ought tie-up rests on an ambiguity\nin the concept of ought, which may be interpreted either in a\ncommendatory sense or in a prescriptive sense. \u201cYou ought to see\nthe current Caravaggio exhibition\u201d provides one with a\nreason for action, an advice, a recommendation that is not binding.\n\u201cYou ought to attend the next faculty meeting\u201d may be a\nconclusive reason for action, a prescription. To further\ncomplicate matters, \u201cought\u201d is often used impersonally, as\nin \u201cit ought to be nice weather for our picnic tomorrow,\u201d\nbut also personally, as in \u201cyou ought to buy wine for the\npicnic.\u201d And \u201cthe picnic ought to have been better\norganized\u201d lies between the personal and the impersonal senses\nof \u201cought,\u201d referring to some unspecified agent\nwithout addressing a prescription to any particular individual.\n\nThe good-ought tie-up works for the commendatory use of\n\u201cought\u201d as well as for the impersonal, but not for the\nprescriptive and personal. \u201cOught\u201d in the personal sense\ninvolves human agency as well as personal responsibility. Laying a\nduty on an individual requires both having a particularly strong (not\njust a) reason and showing how the reason is related to the\nparticular agent. Just being a good state of affairs (even the best)\ndoes not create a reason for x to bring it about. X must\nstand in a particular position to the desirable state of affairs to\nmake her have a (conclusive) reason to bring it about. Once the\ngood-ought tie-up is broken in those central prescriptive contexts of\npersonal \u201cought,\u201d anti-supererogationism loses much of its\nbite. Supererogation is exactly what one does not personally have to\ndo, even if it either ought to be done by someone or would\nlead to a state of affairs which \u201cought to exist.\u201d However\nit remains for the supererogationist view to explain why the personal\nought does not extend to the whole scope of the good.\n",
