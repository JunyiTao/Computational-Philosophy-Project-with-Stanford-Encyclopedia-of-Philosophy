    "main_text": "Epistemological Objections || External World Skepticism\n5.3 External World Skepticism\n\nA frequent criticism of skeptical theism is that it leads to\nskepticism about the external world (see Russell and Wykstra 1988:\n158\u20139; Weisberger 2007: 170\u2013171; Wilks 2013; Law 2017;\nRussell 2017; 2018: 111ff). This criticism turns on the possibility of\ndivine deception. More specifically, consider the following\nhypothesis:\n\nDeceiving God (DG)\n\nGod is deceiving us into believing the earth is extremely old, when in\nreality it is quite young.\n\nIf DG is true, then we are mistaken about the age of\nthe earth. Now atheists can reject DG because it\nimplies God exists; but clearly theists who are skeptical theists\ncannot reject DG for that reason. Theists, who are\nnot skeptical theists, might reject DG by reasoning\nas follows: we can see no reason that would justify God in deceiving\nus in this way; so there is no such reason. But theists who are\nskeptical theists cannot rely on that line of reasoning. After all, as\nlearned from their critiques of noseeum inferences, from the mere fact\nthat it seems to us that God has no reason to (e.g.) deceive us about\nthe age of the earth, it does not yet follow that we are prima\nface justified in believing God has no reason to deceive us about\nthe age of the earth. So skeptical theists who are theists cannot use\neither of these line of reasoning to rule out DG. But\nthis claim about the age of the earth is merely illustrative of any\nnumber of claims about the external world. Thus, skeptical theists who\nare theists cannot use either of these lines of reasoning to rule out\nany number of skeptical hypothesis about the external world that\ninvolve divine deception.\n\nOne type of response is to argue that, for skeptical theists to know\nabout the external world, they do not have to first rule out\nhypotheses like DG. Otherwise put, there are other\nroutes to knowledge about the external world that don\u2019t involve\ninferences about potential divine deception (cf. Bergmann 2009: 391;\n2012: 15). For instance, skeptical theists might embrace externalism\nabout knowledge. According to that position, in order for one to know\nfacts about the external world, one does not need to have access to\nwhat explains that one knows. Thus, one could know facts about the\nexternal world without producing an argument or first ruling out that\none is not being deceived (cf. Bergmann 2008, Hendricks 2020). But\nthere are other routes skeptical theists might explore. For instance,\nthey might accept theories of perception on which we are antecedently\njustified in trusting our perceptual experiences, unless we are given\nevidence that our experiences are misleading in some way (cf. Boyce\n2014). Such antecedent justification need not require first ruling out\nskeptical hypotheses like DG.\n",
