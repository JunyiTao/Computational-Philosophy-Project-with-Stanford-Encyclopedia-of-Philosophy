Life (1903\u20131987)\n\nJohn Niemeyer Findlay was born on 25 November 1903 in Pretoria, South\nAfrica, in what was then the Crown Colony of the\n Transvaal.[1]\n His father, born in South Africa, was by descent Scottish, Welsh, and\nEnglish; his mother, also born in South Africa, was by descent French,\nGerman and Dutch. The Findlays and the Niemeyers were distinguished\nSouth African families. Findlay\u2019s great grandfather, on his\nfather\u2019s side, was the Scottish captain of the ship\nAlacrity and an early European explorer of South Africa. His\ngreat uncle, on his mother\u2019s side, was the poet Eugene Marais,\none of the founders of Afrikaans literature. Findlay\u2019s father\nadvised the government on legal matters, and his cousins included a\nCape Prime Minister, the novelist, Olive Schreiner, and the Brazilian\narchitect Oscar Niemeyer. This birth and lineage has its effect.\nFindlay\u2019s manner, though never cold, combined that mixture of\naristocratic courtesy and unwavering self-assurance sometimes\nassociated with the well-born. This heritage might explain\nFindlay\u2019s confidence in swimming constantly against the\nphilosophical mainstream, and, in his metaphysical work, far out to\n sea.[2]\n\n\nFrom 1909, Findlay attended various grammar schools in Pretoria and\nthe High Veld. He learned Latin and Greek at school, Dutch from his\nnurses, Afrikaans from his friends and French entirely on his own. \nHe memorized poems and wrote many himself. Later in life, he joined a\ntheater company and acted in all the major plays of Chekhov. This love\nof language and theater generated his eloquent prose style, an apt\nvehicle for later virtuoso exercises in phenomenological description.\nIt also percolated into Findlay\u2019s teaching manner, often highly\ntheatrical. He would, for example, in seminars, put a handkerchief\nover his face and then snatch it off, as an illustration of the\nHusserlian distinction between unfulfilled and fulfilled intentions.\nIn 1915, Findlay moved on to the High School for Boys in Pretoria,\nwhere he was (as he writes) \u201cmonotonously\u201d the top student\nin his class every year.\n\nTwo items of philosophical note emerge from Findlay\u2019s youth:\n\nFirst, at age seven Findlay became a firm vegetarian, not because meat\nanimals can suffer, but because (he writes) meat animals are\nconscious, which gives them moral status. (That Findlay was a\nvegetarian will come as a surprise to some of his former graduate\nstudents, who may have observed Findlay carving roast beef at his\nsupper parties, but never noticed he took no plate of his own.)\nPerhaps Findlay\u2019s early attitude towards non-human animals\nprovoked his later separation of mentality from linguistic\n competence.[3]\n\n\nSecond, possibly in reaction to the Christian orthodoxy prevailing at\nthe High School for Boys, Findlay began reading the theosophists,\nincluding Madame Blavatsky, and, one after another, Max\nM\u00fcller\u2019s \u201cSacred Books of the East\u201d, adding\n\u201ca little Sanskrit\u201d to his linguistic repertoire.\nFindlay\u2019s affection for Buddhism and Hinduism was lifelong, and\nhis disaffection with monotheism was also lifelong. It motivated his\nmost discussed article, \u201cCan God\u2019s Existence Be\nDisproved?\u201d (1948a) the title of which was emended by Ryle from\nthe submitted original, \u201cA Disproof of the Existence of\n God\u201d.[4]\n But Findlay was more drawn to the metaphysics of the\ntheosophists, which he identified with Neoplatonism, than to their\nspiritual exercises, and his interest in Madame Blavatsky was guarded.\nNevertheless, Findlay later remarked that his Gifford lectures were\ntheosophy, with all the defective points left out.\n\nFindlay graduated from high school in 1922, and his brother gave him\nas gifts copies of Henri Bergson\u2019s Creative Evolution\n(1907 [1911]) and William Wallace\u2019s translation of\nHegel\u2019s Logic (Hegel 1830 [1873]), his first books of\nWestern philosophy. Hegel\u2019 Logic presented Findlay\nwith an immanent absolute that displaced the Upanishadic mysticism of\nhis teenage years.\n\nIn 1924, Findlay won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, and spent two\nyears at Balliol, reading greats. Despite his affection for Hegel, or\nperhaps because of it, Findlay had little interest in the British\nHegelianism of Bradley or Bosanquet. He veered away from modern\nphilosophy into studies of Plato, developing the hypothesis that\nAristotle\u2019s disparaging remarks about Plato\u2019s late\nphilosophy were important indicators of a deeper Platonic system than\nis found in the dialogues. This historical work, conceived decades\nbefore German scholars began writing in earnest about the\nungescriebende Lehre of late Plato, earned him a First. It\nalso planted the seeds of a book on Plato, which Findlay eventually\npublished, after a typically long gestation, in 1974.\n\nIn his third year at Oxford, Findlay discovered Russell, Wittgenstein,\nand the new realism, which put him at odds with the prevailing Oxford\nidealism. Findlay\u2019s admiration for Russell, a thinker dismissed\nby a contemporaneous Oxford don as \u201cnot a philosopher, but a\ncriminal\u201d foreclosed any possibility of a fellowship. \n\nSo, in 1927, Findlay returned to South Africa as a young philosophy\nlecturer at the University of Pretoria, his first appointment in an\nextended Wanderjahre that included positions at Dunedin\n(New Zealand, 1933\u20131944)\nGrahamstown (Eastern Cape, S.A.1944\u20136), Pietermartizberg\n(Natal, S.A, 1946\u20131948). It was at Dunedin that he met and\nmarried his wife Aileen Hawthorn, with whom he had three children in\nthe early 1940s.\n\nThe Wanderjahre for the Findlays continued in the Northern\nhemisphere after World War II at Newcastle on Tyne (1948\u201351),\nwith an appointment as chair at Kings College, University of London\n(1951\u20131965), and with professorships at Carleton College (1965),\nthe University of Texas (1966\u201367), Yale University\n(1967\u201373) and Boston University (1973\u201384). \n\nFindlay\u2019s academic appointments do not track his intellectual\ndevelopment; the crucial turns in his mental life involved academic\nleaves. In 1929, Findlay went to Germany and spent part of 1930 in\nBerlin. There he learned German, and discovered the works of Brentano,\nMeinong, and Husserl. Brentano inspired Findlay\u2019s book,\nValues and Intentions (VI begun in 1933, published in 1963);\nMeinong inspired the book Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects\n(M, begun in 1931, published in 1933,) and Husserl inspired Findlay to\nundertake the translation (begun in 1939, published in 1970). of\nHusserl\u2019s intricate Logisiche Untersuchungen. The\nresearch on Meinong involved several stays at the University of Graz,\nwhere he received a doctorate in 1932 for his work on Meinong. The\ndepth of his commitment to the phenomenological tradition is indicated\nby the scale of these projects, involving decades of work on an almost\ndaily basis.\n\nThe second leave of consequence was in 1938 and 1939, where Findlay\nwent from New Zealand to England via North America. He met Carnap at\nBerkeley, Russell in Chicago, Quine in Boston, and Heidegger in\nFreiburg. The analytic philosophers made a good impression, Heidegger\na bad one: \n\n\nOne of those natural catastrophes that occur even in philosophy, a\nblanketing snowfall beneath which all the familiar landmarks in\nphilosophy are gradually obscured. \n\n\nHeidegger told Findlay that he would perhaps understand the mysteries\nof Angst and Nothingness if he had had front line experience during\nthe First World War. \n\n\nHis black leggings and peasant attire gave him the vague aspect of a\ncircus-master, cracking his whip while the ominous shapes evoked by\nhis discourse seemed to caper around. (ML: 31) \n\n\nWhile in Freiburg Findlay took a quiet sidelong glance at the workings\nof Nazism: \u201cthe youths and maidens with their bright\nfaces\u201d, and \u201csome poor Jews silently praying as they\npassed the ruins of their demolished synagogue\u201d (Ibid.)\n\nReturning to England, Findlay abandoned Oxford for Cambridge, met with\nMoore and Wittgenstein, and attended their seminars in Fall 1939. The\nresult was a stream of papers in a hard-core analytic style, tightly\nreasoned and bristling with distinctions. These include \u201cTime: a\nTreatment of Some Puzzles\u201d (1941b), \u201cGoedelian Sentences:\nA Non-Numerical Approach\u201d (1942), \u201cMorality by\nConvention\u201d (1944),\u201cCan God's Existence Be\nDisproved?\u201d(1948), \u201cThe Notion of Infinity\u201d (1953),\nand \u201cThe Justification of Attitudes\u201d (1954), all anthologized in\nLanguage, Mind, and Value (LMV, 1963).\n\nWhen Findlay was appointed to King\u2019s College at the University\nof London in 1951, he found himself in competition with A. J. Ayer,\nthe leading light at the University College branch of the same\nuniversity. Ayer, still professing logical positivism, was attracting\nthe best students and professors, so Findlay, by way of strategic\ncontrast, made Hegel the Special Author in the curriculum at Kings.\nThe choice proved surprisingly popular. Ayer generously responded\nwith an offer to publish a book by Findlay on Hegel. The book,\nHegel: A Re-examination (1958) written in a clear style, was\nfor decades a life raft for those graduate students who despaired of\never understanding Hegel in the raw. \n\nFindlay\u2019s efforts in the Hegel book led to a change of method in\nhis work. The requirements of analytic philosophy\u2014the demand for\nclarity, the insistence on deductive connection of ideas-- gave way to\na more flexible movement of thought, where many connections of ideas\nwere declared to be \u201clogical\u201d even if the connection was\nless than deductive. Contradictions and antinomies were embraced;\n\u201cclarity is not enough\u201d became a rallying cry. The new\ntechnique for philosophy is described in Findlay\u2019s article\n\u201cEssential Probabilities\u201d (1967a). Essential probabilism\nencouraged Findlay to return to his long abandoned book on the mind,\npublished as Values and Intentions, in 1961. He returned to\nhis youthful interest in metaphysics, presenting his own speculative\nsystem in two series of Gifford lectures, The Discipline of the\nCave (DC, 1966) and The Transcendence of the Cave (TC,\n1967). In the Gifford lectures, Findlay reintroduced the absolute that\nhe had foresworn in his essay on God. He now conceded publicly that\nthe monotheists were right to have an absolute, but wrong in the\nabsolute they chose. \u201cHow odd/of God/to choose/the\nHindoos\u201d, says the preface to The Transcendence of the\nCave. The later writings of the 1970s are footnotes and\nsupplements to what is given in these three books from the 1960s.\n\nFrom the standpoint of mainstream analytic philosophy, Findlay serves\nas the dedicated contrarian. He threw Husserl at Frege, Meinong at\nRussell, Brentano at the later Wittgenstein. He did not attack with\nthe contemporary method of generating counterexamples to mid-level\nphilosophical generalizations. He set up Husserl and Meinong and\nBrentano as substantial figures, as worthy of interest as their\nanalytic counterparts. When these three diverged from the analytic\ngods, they provided full-fledged philosophical alternatives, not\nisolated pot-shots.\n\nAs for his systematic metaphysics, which exudes an almost Leibnizian\noptimism regarding the failures of the everyday world, Findlay himself\nfelt doubts. What he once said about Hegel applies to his own\nworks:\n\n\nWhen I do hard theoretical work\u2026I feel clear too that the world\nhas a sense, and that no other philosophy [than Hegel\u2019s]\nexpresses this sense satisfactorily. But in my more frequent mood of\nmild depression, I am not a Hegelian: I regress to a materialism which\nis not, I fear, at all dialectical. I see the world as devoid of\nsense, I submit masochistically to its senselessness, even taking more\ncomfort in its cold credibility than in the rational desirability of\nHegelianism. (\u201cThe Contemporary Relevance of Hegel\u201d, 1959a\n[LMV: 231]) \n\n\nDespite these depressions, Findlay remained loyal from first to last\nto his favorite texts: the Timaeus of Plato, the\nEnneads of Plotinus, and the Logic of Hegel:\n\u201cPlato for inventing the forms, Plotinus for relating them to an\nabsolute, and Hegel for setting them all into dialectical\nmotion\u201d (Lecture at Baruch College, New York City, April 1976.\nunpublished). The reward for loyalty was a singular philosophy of\nunusual scope.\n2. Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects (1932\u20133)\n\nFindlay reports that he was won over to realism (i.e., anti-idealism),\nduring his undergraduate years, mainly through clandestine readings of\nRussell and Moore. Reading Russell, he certainly became acquainted\nwith the name and ideas of Alexius Meinong, discussed by Russell at\nlength in 1904 and 1905 (Russell 1904 [1973]). In 1930, after he\nacquired German, Findlay began reading Meinong\u2019s works in\nearnest, under the direction of Meinong\u2019s pupil Ernst Mally.\n\nThe result was the book, Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects,\npublished by Oxford in 1933, and expanded in 1963 into\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects and Values (M). This book,\nfor decades, was the standard reference work on Meinong in the\nAnglophone world. Given Mally\u2019s imprimatur, we can presume that\nFindlay\u2019s account of Meinong is accurate, but what is more\nrelevant is Findlay\u2019s defense of Meinong against his critics,\nRussell most of all.\n\nThe dispute turned, notoriously, on the status of non-existent\nobjects. For Meinong, there are non-existent objects, they can possess\nproperties, and true things can be said about them. For Russell, there\nare no non-existing objects, they cannot possess properties, and\nnothing true can be said about them. So, for Meinong, it is true the\ngolden mountain is golden, because everything that is F and\nG is F. For Russell, it is false that the golden\nmountain is golden, because there is no such thing as the golden\nmountain to be golden.\n\nRussell dismissed Meinong with a few deft sentences in 1905. If you\nsay that the golden mountain is golden, then you must say that there\nis a golden mountain, that there are chimeras, that there is a present\nKing of France. This offends, Russell later wrote, against our\n\u201crobust sense of reality\u201d. Furthermore, if the golden\nmountain is mountainous and golden, then the round square is both\nround and square, so something exists that is round and square. This\noffends against the law of non-contradiction. Many readers accepted\nthese arguments as decisive. But not Findlay. \n\nTo begin, there is a question as to whether Russell got\nMeinong\u2019s position right. Meinong never maintained that the\nround square existed (or subsisted). On the contrary, it neither\nexists nor subsists, so for Meinong nothing exists that is both round\nand square. But it can be a subject of predication, and if the\npredication is correct, it is a part of a fact, and facts about\ncontradictions are not contradictions. In other words, in terms of\npropositions, Meinong maintained that:\n\n(1) the round square is\nround\n\n\nand\n\n(2) the round square is\nnon-round\n\n\nare both true but denied that from (2) one could infer\n\n(3) not (the round\nsquare is round.)\n\n\nNow (3) contradicts (1) but (2) does not. So we have Meinong\nmaintaining, as a general law, \u201cThe F and G is\nF\u201d, and Russell maintaining, as a general law,\n\u201cNothing can be a subject of predication unless it\nexists\u201d. This seems to pit a logical proposition against a\nmetaphysical one, a win for Meinong. \n\nThe round square inhabits a realm Meinong called Aussersein,\nand Findlay points out that sections of Aussersein can be\ngrouped into compatible entities and consistent propositions (or\nfacts) about them. These correspond, Findlay argues, to the different\ndomains of different possible worlds (M: 58)) That different possible\nworlds can have different domains would become one of Findlay\u2019s\nmajor complaints against Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus and\nits fixed domain of ultimate objects. \n\nThere are, of course, metaphysical issues lurking in the background.\nRussell certainly wanted to make statements that, prima\nfacie, are about non-existents, like the present king of France.\nRussell\u2019s famous trick replaces statements about non-existing\nindividuals with statements about sets of properties that do not\njointly hold of any individual. Findlay believed that Russell\u2019s\nidea was best expressed by Moore in 1918:\n\n\nWe have said that \u2018lions are real\u2019 means that some\nparticular property or other\u2014I will say, for the sake of\nbrevity, the property of being a lion, though that is not strictly\naccurate, does in fact belong to something\u2014that there\nare things that have it, or, to put in another way, that the\nconception of being a lion is a conception which does apply to some\nthings\u2014that there are things that fall under it. And similarly\nwhat \u201cunicorns are unreal\u201d means is that the property of\nbeing a unicorn belongs to nothing. Now, if this is so, then\nit seems to me, in a very important sense, \u2018real\u2019 and\n\u2018unreal\u2019 do not in this usage stand for any conceptions\nare all. The only conceptions which occur in the proposition\n\u2018Lions are real\u2019 are on this interpretation are, plainly\n(1) the conception of being a lion, and (2) the conception of\nbelonging to something, and perfectly obviously \u201creal\u201d\ndoes not stand for either of these. (Moore 1918 [1959: 212]))\n\n\nFindlay disagrees vigorously with this form of metaphysical actualism,\nwhich he describes as an illicit reduction of facts about being to\nfacts about so-being.\n\n\nLet us consider the case of a person who wishes that there were such a\nthing as a philosopher\u2019s stone. If the fact of the existence of\nthe philosopher\u2019s stone is identical with the fact of the\npossession by some object in the universe of the properties of the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone, then we must suppose that the person in\nquestion is really wishing that one or the other of the objects in the\nuniverse should possess the properties of (a) being a stone, and (b)\nturning baser metal into gold. But it is perfectly clear that the man\nmight wish nothing of the kind. He might be perfectly content with all\nthe objects in the universe\u2026 If a childless woman wishes for\nchild, she does not wish to stand in the relation of motherhood to one\nof the children actually in the world, but to another child, which is\nnot in the circumstances an actual child at all, but which would\nbecome an actual child if her wish were fulfilled. It is no doubt true\nthat, if her wish is fulfilled, one of the things actually in the\nworld will be her child, but it is equally true that, while she is\nwishing, she is directing her mind to something which lies beyond the\nactual world, and which will possibly always like beyond it. (M:\n30\u201353-4 )\n\n\nIt is not possible here to follow Findlay\u2019s defense of\nMeinong\u2019s realm of objectives, which includes states of affairs,\nfacts, and other abstract entities that, in Meinong\u2019s\nterminology, subsist rather than exist. Many of Meinong\u2019s\nanalyses predate the classic texts of logical atomism with which they\nshare a common core of analytic concerns, such as the relation between\nstates of affairs and facts. Findlay is even more generous than\nMeinong in describing the population of subsistents:\n\n\nIt is highly arguable that human experience, even at the level of\nperception, is rich in objects that go beyond the concrete existent\nthings of an individualist ontology. The world around us seems to be\nfull of bearings, of suggestions, of half-formed possibilities, of\npin-pointed acts or circumstances, of gaps, vaguenesses, of\ngeneralities, or unrealized limits, and it is of dogma rather than\ndirect experiences that all these higher order things will reduce to\nindividuals and their actual properties. (AE: 29)\n\n\nOn the analytic subjects, to which the most space in the book is\ndevoted, where Russell and Wittgenstein diverge from Meinong, Findlay\nsides with Meinong. But his exposition is not slavish. The realm of\nAussersein has its problems:\n\n\nWe speak of the world of Aussersein, but in reality the\nobjects which have no being do not constitute a world. They are a\nchaos of incoherent fragments\u2026.Between actual existents we can\nalways discover a large number of intimate connections. Beyond the\nboundaries of being no such connections subsist: there is no fixed\ndistance between Valhalla and the islands of the blessed, nor does the\nplanet Vulcan exert a gravitational pull on the star of Bethlehem. (M:\n56)\n\n\nAnd even the famous expansion of the ontology has its problematic\nside:\n\n\nTo do what Meinong does, and merely to set the non-existent, false,\nand absurd alongside the actual and the true, to treat them like the\nwhite and red roses of Russell\u2019s famous\n comparison,[5]\n with nothing to explain the special prerogative of being real or\nbeing the case, is the very type of a dead, surd, and unintelligible\nmode of conception. (M: 342) \n\n\nDespite the doubts expressed here about the realms of Sein\nand Aussersein, Findlay would press them into service in many\nfuture books. To begin, the objects of these realms serve as the\nintentional objects of thought. Second, these realms provide the\nreferents for \u201cvacuous\u201d names in works of fiction. These\nare the opening gambits of the next book, Values and\nIntentions.\n3. Values and Intentions (1936\u201363)\n\nAfter completing the book on Meinong in 1932, Findlay began work on\nValues and Intentions (VI), a project that occupied him, on\nand off, for the next thirty years. The resulting book combines the\nphenomenological tradition of Brentano with the analytical psychology\nof G. F. Stout and the empirical discoveries of the W\u00fcrzburg\npsychologists. It also attempts to integrate the philosophy of mind\nand moral philosophy. Its predecessor, and perhaps its organizational\nmodel, is Hume\u2019s Treatise (1738), which also begins\nwith perceptions, proceeds to emotions, and then moves on to\nconclusions about ethics. But it rejects Hume\u2019s phenomenalism,\nand attempts a smoother dialectical flow from the laws of the mind to\nthe rules of justice.\n\nOn a typical page of Values and Intentions, one finds little\nargument but much description. These descriptions of mental processes\nare presented as the results of introspection. Now, even by 1932,\nintrospection was rejected as a method in both philosophy and\npsychology. This dismissive attitude was recognized, weighed, and\nrejected by Findlay in his article \u201cRecommendations Concerning\nthe Language of Introspection\u201d (1948b). The reader, on first\nencountering Values and Intentions, may stand with\nWittgenstein and declare, \u201cBy God, this is impossible\u201d. Or\nshe may be persuaded by Findlay that it can be done because he does\nit. From Findlay\u2019s viewpoint, Wittgenstein portrays our inner\nlife as a desert. For him, it is a rainforest.\n\nFindlay follows Brentano in vigorously maintaining that intentionality\nis the mark of the mental. But then the exposition turns Husserlian.\nIntentional objects are presented to consciousness, but they can\npresent themselves clearly or obscurely, completely or incompletely,\nin various lights and with varying scope. There is a problem\ndistinguishing what is in consciousness from what lies outside it.\n\u201cWe must distinguish, between what is actually and what is only\nfacultatively or dispositionally present to mind\u201d. The\ndistinction provides an occasion for a typical descriptive\nexcursus:\n\n\nThe interior of a church may be ready to come to mind when I\nlook steadily at its fa\u00e7ade, but this is not the same as the\nactual presence to my mind of [the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s] contrasting\npattern of black and white layers, which I nevertheless do not\nexplicitly \u2018notice\u2019\u2026. In thinking of Jeremiah I\nmay, e.g., think definitively, though obscurely, of Hebrew prophets\nand prophecy: I may, however, only be ready to think of the\nprophet Amos or of the prophetess Joanna Southcott. (VI: 48)\n\n\n\n\nThe rule is that for every thought, there is an object of thought.\nPrior and many other have objected to this: Prior\u2019s\ncounterexample is \u201cI am thinking of nothing\u201d (Prior 1971:\n122\u2013123). But these counterexamples only work if the sentences\nthat express them are true. One wonders if one can think of nothing,\nor whether what is referred to in \u201cthinking of nothing\u201d,\nis, as older people often experience, an unnoticed bout of\nunconsciousness.\n\nA deeper problem for Findlay and the \u201cmind as\nintentionality\u201d school is the presence of phenomena that seem to\nbe mental but are not intentional, like the pains and quales that\npreoccupy discussions in the contemporary philosophy of mind. Here\nFindlay reverts, surprisingly, to his \u201cdepressed\nmaterialism\u201d and identifies such states with bodily\nconditions:\n\n\nThat the category of indiscerptible, qualitative feeling has no plain\ninstances has been recognized by thinkers, who, like Titchener, reduce\nthe life of feeling to two strange \u201cfeeling elements\u201d of\npleasure or unpleasure, or who like Ryle, operate with various\ntwinges, tingles, throbs, and other residua of emotional\nexperience\u2026. These doctrines are a mistake, only abstracts torn\nfrom sensible objects have such qualitative status, the whole placing\nof them \u2018in the mind\u2019 points to a confusion and\nmisapplication of categories.\u2026\n\n\u2026here their links with our conscious orientations seem\ncontingent rather than necessary: it is for instance unclear\nwhy sensory pains should be so very disagreeable, so much an\nobject of aversion.\u2026 our hatred of pain is not per se\nintelligible, but can at best achieve a quasi-intelligibility when\nseen in the more general quasi-intelligibility of \u2018bodily\npurpose.\u2019 \n\nThe main emergent use of \u2018feeling\u2019 in connection with our\nown bodies, is therefore that of the largely obscure\u2026knowledge\nof our bodily state; it is the intimation of the body itself gives us\nof our inner condition. (VI: 172\u20133)\n\n\nIt is possible, then, to have a pain and yet not be repelled by it, a\nview confirmed by modern medical research on pain agnosia.\n\nIt is not possible here to unravel all the details of Findlay\u2019s\ntreatment of beliefs, wishes, wants, and acts of will. Each token case\nof a propositional attitude can manifest itself as a concentrated\n\u201csense\u201d before the mind, or spread itself out as a pattern\nof behavior in the physical sphere. The account is complicated,\nperhaps too complicated for anyone to have accepted it. But we must\nremark on the distinction between believing and wishing, as this\npoints towards the ethics section of the book. When we believe that\nsomething is so, we cannot wish that it is so. We can only wish that\nit be not so. Conversely, when we believe that something is not so, we\ncannot wish that it be not so, but we can wish that it be so. Wishes,\nthen, are directed at making the non-existent exist or the existing\nnot exist. (or, in a parallel way, towards the making true or the\nmaking false of propositions.) This is the starting point of ethics.\nWe wish the world changed in some\n way.[6]\n\nIf ethics starts with wishes, then the ethical system that emerges\nwill be broadly teleological: the good is prior to the right, as the\ngood is what we wish for. But the good cannot be a one dimensional\ngood, nor can the many dimensions of good be compared with each other,\nnor is it intelligible to speak of \u201cmaximizing the good\u201d.\nSo the system that results is a form of ideal utilitarianism of the\nsort desiderated by Hastings Rashdall (1907) and described in the last\nchapter of Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica (1903: ch. 6). It\nis hostile to rule based ethical systems deriving from the Decalogue\nor Kant, and hostile to puritanism while suspicious of hedonism.\nFindlay\u2019s principles of axiology, culled and combined from the\nworks of Brentano, Meinong, Scheler, and Hartmann, as well as Moore,\nRashdall, and Ross, include:\n\n\n\u2026.that there are radically different sorts or senses of value\nbetween which quantitative or even ordinal comparison is not readily\npossible, that there is a deep distinction between values that appear\npurely personal and those that claim cogency or validity, that value\nand values have a close and necessary relation to feeling, but that\nvalues that claim cogency or validity cannot be exhaustively analyzed\nor even explained in terms of mere feeling, that the main\n\u2018heads\u2019 of impersonal valuation, freedom, fairness,\nhappiness etc, are moderately clearly and readily agreed upon though\ntheir detailed specification or correct practical implementation is\ninfinitely controversial, that value and disvalue have close\nconnections with various senses of \u201cought\u201d but that the\ncentral sense of the latter reveal it as a much more restricted\nconception, much more closely concerned with disvalues and their\navoidance than with values\u2026 that the values called\n\u201cmoral\u201d presuppose all other types of value as objects of\npursuit, but their value does not depend on the latter value, that\nmoral value has a close connection with the readiness to sacrifice\npersonal good for impersonal good, etc. (AE: 78)\n\n\nPerhaps the most unusual claim of Values and Intentions is\nthat there is a dialectical connection between personal values and\nimpersonal values. Adam Smith had described the shift from the partial\nspectator to the impartial spectator, and contemporary authors remark\nfrequently on the transition from the first person standpoint to the\nthird (or second) person standpoint. In these authors, however, the\ntransition is contingent, based either on a free choice, or on moral\neducation, or on Aristotelian conditioning. In Findlay, the transition\nis based on a drive for generality that is inherent in the operations\nof the mind:\n\n\nIt is natural, and nigh inevitable, for a man reflecting more or less\ndisengagedly on the objects of his various parcelled interests to\nacquire a second-order zest for the interesting as such and for any\nand every interest.(TC: 70)...impersonality is by\nits nature contagious. It obeys a \u2018logic\u2019 and that logic is to spread, to level farther and farther, to become more and more\nabsolute. Once speak for some, and one will find oneself\nreadily forced into speaking for more, until, in all situations not\nwarped by personal bias, one comes to speak for all: impersonality\nresembles the scriptural mustard-seed in whose branches the fowls of\nthe air ultimately find their accommodation. (VI 430)\n\n\nFindlay in many places develops this \u201cdrive for\ngenerality\u201d. To begin, there are certain basic values that\naccompany all good thinking, such as clarity, consistency, and\nsimplicity. These are essential to communication; they are\n\u201cvalues in speaking\u201d (1950b [LMV 105\u2013128]), and must\nbe deployed even by nihilists who profess contempt for logic.\nSecondly, there are the virtues of good scientific thinking, including\navoidance of arbitrary Duhemian maneuvers and manufactured concepts\nlike Goodman\u2019s \u201cgrue\u201d and\n \u201cbleen\u201d.[7]\n Thirdly, there are the virtues of good practical reasoning, including\nrational arbitration between the demands of present versus future\nselves. Like Sidgwick before him and T. Nagel after, Findlay argues\nthat the admitting the demands of my future self but a step towards\nadmitting the demands of other selves:\n\n\nThe rise to self-love is in fact a matter so strange that the further\nspread to rational benevolence is trivial by comparison: having come\nto be interested in, e.g., the provision of food at a time when I am\nnot hungry, it is no great wonder that I am rationally moved by\nanother\u2019s real or imagined need for food as much as by my\nown.\u2026 And by, an extension natural to it, once its ampliative\nzeal has got underway, it tends to extend itself to an interest in\nwhat is interesting to anyone or everyone, and to develop a defensive\ndislike of whatever sets grounds to its natural expansiveness. (TC:\n71) \n\n\nThe drive to generality moves us from favoring personal good to\nimpersonal goods. Rules about the right, or the \u201cmoral\nought\u201d concern the production, distribution, or destruction of\nimpersonal goods. Oddly, justice in impersonal goods requires the\nrecognition of persons, subjective selves. These are introduced in\nValues and Intentions via discussions of the problem of other\nminds, which for Findlay is no pseudo-problem. The solution is found\nby applying the ubiquitous phenomenological relation of \u201cseeing\nas\u201d to social interactions. The argument involves the idea that\nmental states are psycho-physical complexes with poignant concentrated\nfeelings on one side and spread out behavior on the other. We perceive\nsome patterns of behavior as intentional, some as mechanical. When we\nperceive the behavior as intentional, we infer the psychical side.\n(Findlay\u2019s discussion of reactive perceptions anticipates by\nseveral years Peter Strawson\u2019s work on reactive attitudes.) The\nbottom line, however, is familiar: justice requires placing oneself in\nthe shoes of the other.\n4. The Husserl Translation (1939\u201370)\n\nFindlay attitude towards Husserl was conflicted. On the one hand, he\ndeclared, more than once and without qualification, that Husserl was\n\u201cthe greatest philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d. On\nthe other, he rejected most of the philosophical claims published by\nHusserl subsequent to 1912.\n\nThe conflict was doctrinal. The biographical section has described\nFindlay\u2019s embrace of realism toward the end of his undergraduate\nyears. Through his long career, Findlay never wavered from his\ncommitment to realism, that is, to the view that very little of\nreality is \u201cmind-made\u201d. It is not surprising, then, that\nFindlay would react negatively to Husserl\u2019s swerve towards\nidealism, first exhibited in his Ideen of\n 1913.[8]\n So it was also natural for Findlay to focus on Husserl\u2019s early\nwork, the Logisiche Untersuchungen (1901\u201303) most of\nall. By the late 1930s, he was committed to translating this massive\ntext into English. (Wittgenstein asked him in 1939 why he was so\ninterested in \u201cthat old work\u201d.) When the translation\nappeared, in 1970, it made less of a splash than might have been\nexpected. Husserl\u2019s student and assistant, Marvin Farber, had\nalready published a paraphrase of the Untersuchungen in 1942,\nand laid side by side, there are not terribly significant differences\nbetween the two renditions, and some readers prefer Farber to Findlay\nthe way some Anglophone Kant readers prefer Kemp-Smith to Guyer.\n\nWhatever disagreements Findlay had as regards Husserl\u2019s\nconclusions, he never wavered from his admiration of his analytical\nabilities. He supported the approach to numbers presented in\nHusserl\u2019s Philosophy of Arithmetic (1891), a book that\nHusserl himself had repudiated. (Findlay endorsed Husserl\u2019s idea\nof numbers as essentially sequential, and held it superior to the\nFrege-Russell account: \u201cIn Principia\u201d, he once\nremarked, \u201cyou always end up counting the quantifiers\u201d\n(1975b)). He championed Husserl\u2019s lectures on the phenomenology\nof inner time consciousness (1905\u201311), arguing that the\nunfolding-folding schema (e.g., the past becoming past past, and the\npast past becoming the past past past) proposed by Husserl captured\nwhat Kant and James had correctly but dimly prefigured concerning the\nnature of time (TC: 151). Among Husserl\u2019s later works, he found\nmuch to praise in the notion of \u201clife world\u201d developed in\nHusserl\u2019s last book, Experience and Judgment\n(1939).\n\nBut as regards idealism, Findlay drew a line in the sand. It is simply\nfalse, he wrote, that esse est construi. He rejected\nHusserl\u2019s famous \u201cepoch\u00e9\u201d, or\nsuspension of the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d towards the world,\neven arguing the epoch\u00e9, is inconsistent with\nidealism. Husserl has assumed that to not affirm the natural world is\nto affirm that the natural world is not. But a true suspension would\naffirm nothing, either way.\n\n\nHusserl has provided no good\nor even meaningful reason for doubting that the natural world exists,\nhowever much that existence may also have been\n\u2018constituted\u2019 or rather reconstituted for out minds, and\nthat its processes have an important causal relation to the\nacts of constitution just mentioned, being in fact responsible for the\n\u2018fulfilment\u2019 of those acts through appropriated data, and\nthat natural objects are increasingly given as they are in and for\nthemselves, in an unbracketed and not merely bracketed sense, both\nthrough the normal perceptions of men and the theories of the less\nmethodologically prejudiced scientists. (\"Phenomenology and the Meaning of Realism,\" 1975b, 156)\n\n\nGiven such deep disparagement, what did Findlay find in Husserl that\njustified the accolades Findlay showered on him? Findlay in his last\nbook would remark that analytic philosophy has two obsessions:\nreference and representation. He found in Brentano\u2019s notion of\nintentionality, and Husserl\u2019s\u2019 implementation of it, a\ncomprehensive theory of meaning that underlay both reference and\nrepresentation and extended to areas undreamt of by the descendants of\nFrege and Russell. There is more to reference than language; there is\nmore to representation than mental mirroring. This for Findlay was the\nHusserl\u2019s enduring legacy.\n5. Time and Tense (1941; 1956)\n\n\u201cThe founding father of modern tense logic was J. N.\nFindlay\u201d, Arthur Prior wrote in 1967. \n\n\n[Findlay] said in a paper published in 1941 [1941b [1963]] that\n\u201cour conventions with regard to tenses are so well worked out\nthat we have practically the materials in them for a formal calculus.\n\u2026the calculus of tenses should have been included in the modern\ndevelopment of modal logics\u201d. (1967: 1)\n\n\nFindlay\u2019s commitment to tense logic in 1941 went beyond the\nannouncement of project for future logicians. He supplied in the\narticle a modal form for tensed statements, and laid down a few tense\nlogical \u201claws\u201d governing such.\n\nThe form of tensed statements, Findlay insisted, was modal, not\nvariable. It had been the custom of logicians previously to consider\ntensed statements as \u201cincomplete\u201d statements, like\nRussellian propositional functions, where the gap in the function was\nto be filled in by supplying a date. So\n\nArchduke Ferdinand was shot at Sarajevo\n\n\nwas considered incomplete, neither true nor false, until the verb was\nde-tensed and a date added to the statement:\n\nArchduke Ferdinand is assassinated on June 28, 1914\n\n\nBut adding a date does not tell us that the assassination has\nhappened. To preserve the temporal claim, Findlay suggested the modal\nform: \n\nPast (Archduke Ferdinand being assassinated)\n\n\nThe truth conditions of A and B differ. C is the correct translation\nof A. \n\nPrior claimed what is modalized by Findlay is a statement, but in\nFindlay\u2019s text it is more like an event description, symbolized\nby \u201cx\u201d. What is modalized is a mode of occurring.\nThree modal laws are suggested in the 1941 article:\n\nPresent (x) implies Present (Present (x)):\n\nWhat is present is presently present.\nFuture (Present x) implies Present (Future x):\n\nWhat will be present is presently future.\n(Past x) or (Present x) or (Future x) implies\nFuture (Past x):\n\nWhat is either past or present or future will be past. \n\n\nLaw III shows that Findlay has not excluded vacuous names for events.\nThe laws apply to non-occurring events. For example, what is never\nfuture, for example, is never past, in models with no earliest\nmoment.\n\nIt appears, then, that we have two different languages. In the first,\nverbs are tenseless but dated. In the second, verbs are tensed but\nundated. Do we need two languages? In the language with dates, we can\nmeasure that interval between two events, and compare it with the\ninterval between two other events. In a system of moving objects, we\ncan partially order the dates via the Special Theory of Relativity.\nWhy bother with the tensed system at all?\n\nIn \u201cAn Examination of Tenses\u201d (1956a), Findlay gives\nreasons for retaining the tensed system. The dated system implies a\n\u201cblock universe\u201d of events pinned at unchanging locations\nin space-time. But the essence of time is change. Furthermore, and\nmore interestingly, Findlay argues that a block universe cannot\nexplain the fact that we know so much more about the past than the\nfuture, and that this asymmetry is not inferable from the structure of\nspace-time or the laws relating events within it. (Findlay cites\nEhrenfels [1916] for noticing that all the basic laws of physics are\ntime symmetric.) Findlay proposes his own explanation of the\nasymmetry: collisions between particular substances changes their\nconfiguration, and these changes, or \u201ctraces\u201d provide\nevidence in the present for collisions in the past. (This explanation\nof temporal asymmetry via traces is distinct from claiming that the\ncollisions release heat and increase entropy, which would reduce\ntemporal asymmetry to principles of thermodynamics.) General\nprinciples are not involved, only the historical facts of particular\ncollisions when world lines criss-cross. Why are there no present\ntraces of the future events? Because future collision have not yet\noccurred.\n6. The Gifford Lectures\n\nFindlay delivered the Gifford Lectures in two series at the University\nof St. Andrews, the first set, The Discipline of the Cave,\nfrom December 1964 to February 1965, the second set, The\nTranscendence of the Cave, from December 1965 to January 1966.\nThe Discipline of the Cave is dominated by the cave metaphor\npresented in Plato\u2019s Republic; The Transcendence of\nthe Cave is dominated by the metaphor of the metaphysical\nhemisphere, derived from Plotinus, especially Ennead V, 8,\n\u201cOf Intellectual Beauty\u201d.\n\nThe strategy of the lectures is similar to F. H. Bradley\u2019s in\nAppearance and Reality (1893). The ordinary natural world is\nfound to be absurd and self-contradictory, and the contradictions\npoint to a different world that is ultimately real. In Bradley\u2019s\ncase the contradictions emerge from the idea that the ordinary natural\nworld is a world of substances that somehow \u201cpossess\u201d\nproperties. In Findlay\u2019s case, the contradictions emerge from\nabsurdities in the concepts of space, time, and material bodies, not\nonly in their ordinary manifestations but also in their scientific\ndoppelgangers.\n\nWhat do these alleged absurdities point to? In Bradley\u2019s case,\nthe absurdities of distinct substances point to a realm of\nundifferentiated and undirected Feeling. In Findlay\u2019s case, the\nabsurdities show merely that we are in a cave, and if we are inside,\nthere is necessarily an outside. The outside will prove to be a\nmarvelously complex web of perfected individuals. Though mystics have\nresponded positively to Findlay\u2019s more Swedenborgian\npostulations, an argument is needed to give them minimal philosophical\ncredibility. Findlay gives two: first, the argument that everything\nthat is ideal in the actual world is actual in an ideal\n world;[9]\n second, that in an ideal world the distinctions between type and\ninstance, between fact and value, are progressively wiped out, so that\nthe distinction between the ideal and the actual is no longer\napplies.\n\nThe features of the Cave are given by phenomenology; the escape from\nthe Cave is provided by dialectic. It is not possible to follow\nFindlay in all the vivid phenomenological descriptions provided in DC.\nA small part of the discussion of space will serve as an example:\n\n\nOur idea of void space is one of most poignantly clear that we\npossess; it is the indispensable foil to body. We cannot move our\nmembers without being aware of it\u2026True void is not seen or\ntouched, or if seen and touched, not quite in the same manner as the\nbodies in it: it is nonetheless in front of us, even if its vividness\nis marred by one or two wafts of air or by similar\nirrelevancies\u2026 The space of our own bodies as given in bodily\nfeeling in the dark watches of the night is often little different\nfrom void space: what is evident, indefeasible in it, is its three\ndimensionality, its extension and position, not the feeble sense\ncontents that irrelevantly flicker through it (DC: 99)\u2026[I suggest that]\nwhat is now called a Euclidean structure, and what is now regarded as\na somewhat unadventurous type of spatiality among a thrilling variety\nof such, is in fact simply the notion of space as such, and all other\nnotions of space presuppose it, and represent progressive deviations\nfrom it, deviations which present no formal impossibility, but which\nrepresent no less the slow demise, the putting out of action, of the\nnobly interesting notion of space. (DC: 101)\n\n\nSimilar, and lengthy, phenomenological treatments are given of time\nand bodies. Where are the absurdities? Findlay argues that for bodies\nto be bodies, they must proceed unaffected through the media of space\nand time, but at the same time, space and time, to be what they are,\nmust interact with body. So space and time must be absolute, and must\nbe relative, a contradiction. As for bodies, there are insuperable\nproblems about the relation between bodies and their observable\nqualities, and between some bodies and their governing minds.\n\nThe list of such like antinomies is long, yet the underlying malady is\nclear: in one way or another, they all stem from the separation of\nindividuals from each other. What is the remedy for these separations?\nIn the first half of the Transcendence Findlay considers\nHegel\u2019s proposal that these separations can be overcome by the\ndevelopment of common realm of logical concepts, meanings, ideals, and\nshared gods, at least where rational beings are found. But in\nTranscendence, Lecture 5, Findlay rejects the Hegelian\noption: \n\n\nOur aim is therefore bring to ruin the whole teleological fabric we\nhave been rearing, particularly its crowning religious\nmanifestations\u2026 The main uneasiness that affects the\nteleological picture can be quite readily stated: it lies in its\nimposed, arbitrary, willful character. (TC: 102) To view all phenomena in a\nspecial teleological relation to our rational selves remains a\ndifficult, unstable way of viewing things (TC: 103)\u2026The stars may be, as\nHegel said, a mere light-rash upon the sky, infinitely insignificant\nbeside the simplest human thought or emotion. But is there not\nsomething very wanton in saying that the whole meaning of the former,\nin all their immensity of spatial and temporal extent, lies in their\nrole as mere background or supposition of the latter? It is\nparticularly when we consider such factors as the extent of space, now\nyawning more and more vacuously as planet after planet reveals itself\nbare of its imagined population, that a teleological absolutism\n\u00e0 la Hegel seems more and more frivolous (TC: 104) \u2026 Plainly again\nit is only by a dialectical tour of force that this can be held to be\ninvolved in our wretched, confused, heartless, piecemeal\nliving (TC 105)\u2026 The objects of religion may be the supreme occupants\nof the human cave, but they are also the most blemished by antinomy\nand obscurity of any cave phenomenon (TC 106)\u2026 We conclude that the\nactual religions of the world, which all represent rational faith at\nits highest, are also all phenomena of the Cave, with inappropriate\nabsurd, sinister, and even monstrous elements, which most apologists\nhave sought to minimize. (TC: 117)\n\n\nMonotheism and Hegelianism cannot rescue us from the vast\narbitrariness of the physical universe: that these things exist and\nnot others, that these things are here and others are there; that\nthese things happened now, and not later, and that these things will\nhappen later but not now: all these are tossed in a sea of\ncontingency, all are de trop. But Plotinus does provide an\nanswer: it is not only our notions of things that can overcome\nseparation: is the things themselves, which contain a dimension of the\ndivine. This leads to the new metaphor of the \u201cPlotinian\nhemisphere\u201d. Consider the liberated inhabitants of the cave as\nscattered along the equator of a sphere. Each individual is\nintersected by a meridianal line, and these lines rise and converge on\nthe pole. These metaphorical lines of hemispheric \u201cotherworldly\ngeography\u201d include the points they intersect, so each thing at\nthe equator is also part of what exists at the pole, at which and in\nwhich their differences disappear. (Take a square inscribed within a\ncircle and shrink it to a point; the result will be a point-like round\nsquare.) The pole here is the Plotinian One, the\n\u201cabsolute\u201d to which Findlay will devote an entire\nsubsequent book, Ascent to the Absolute. But in the Gifford\nlectures, it is the lives of the individuals as their meridians\napproach the pole that is the detailed object of description. Findlay\nleans here heavily on Plotinus\u2019 portrait of the Realm of Mind,\nand the portrait of the spirit world of the Buddha, as given in the\nGandavyuha, in which individuals can exchange places without crossing\nthe space between, in which every mind is accessible to every other,\nand in which the shoes of the other become one\u2019s own shoes:\n\n\nLife is easy yonder, and truth is their parent and nurse, and they see\nall things, not such as are in flux, but as have true being, as they\nsee themselves in others\u2026 For all things are transparent, and\nnothing is dark and resistant, light being made manifest to light.\n(Plotinus Enneads V, 8; Findlay\u2019s own translation [TC:\n158])\n\n\nThe Gifford audience was very small, \u201cthe most exiguous of my\nexperience, but not inattentive\u201d. One wonders what the reception\nof these lectures might have been had they been presented in 1893, the\nsame year as Bradley\u2019s Appearance and Reality.\n7. \u201cThe Perspicuous and the Poignant\u201d\n\nThis, the last of Findlay\u2019s \u201canalytical\u201d articles,\nand his sole separate contribution to aesthetics, was published in\n1967 in the British Journal of Aesthetics. The discussion of\nthe aesthetic values of perspicuity and poignancy harks back to\nPlotinian values of clarity and intensity. But the unusual turn in the\narticle is the connection of the \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d with\nthe philosophical psychology of Brentano:\n\n\nBrentano divided the attitudes of the conscious mind into three basic\nspecies. There was mere conception or presentation, having something\nbefore one or present to one, without taking up any further conscious\nstance towards it; there was the theoretical acceptance of something\nas real, true, existent, believable\u2026 and there was finally the\nother non-theoretical acceptance or rejection which is present in our\nfeelings,\u2026 our desires, and all our practical decisions\u2026\nWe may well doubt whether pure presentation has that priority in\nmental life which Brentano gave to it, whether it is not perhaps\nrightly regarded as a deficient mode of attitudes far more involved\nand existential. However this may be, the value of the scheme is that\nis places the aesthetic field very satisfactorily\u2014the aesthetic\nfield is one of suspended conception, of pure having something before\none to contemplate. It is a field essentially divorced from the\nYes-No of belief and conviction, as it is divorced from the other\nYes-No of practical concern\u2026When we are aesthetically minded we\nare interested in what comes before us purely as an instance of\ncharacter regardless as to whether there really is, or is not, such a\nthing or sort of thing, and our interest is moreover, not concerned,\nas practical interest always is, to bring what is merely thought of or\nintended into the field of reality, or to push something from the\nfield of reality out into the field of the merely thought or intended.\n(1967d [1972: 94])\n\n\nPresentations need not, and sometimes cannot, be sensually filled, so\nthe resulting aesthetics does not emphasize sense perception, allowing\nFindlay to speak comfortably of the beauty of mathematical proofs and\nother abstracta. Likewise, the separation of presentations from\nemotions, Brentano\u2019s \u201cfeelings of love and hate\u201d,\nundercuts expressionistic aesthetic theories, allowing Findlay to\nspeak coherently about severely abstract works of art that neither\nconvey nor provoke emotion.\n\nPresentations, however, can be clear or obscure, and Findlay makes\nclarity a necessary condition of aesthetic quality. (This includes\nbeing clear about obscure things). The poignancy requirement is more\nunusual, and involves what Findlay describes as an\n\u201carrest\u201d in our normally turbulent mental life. Some\nperspicuous presentations bore us, but the poignant ones captivate us:\nwe are rapt, ecstatic, in contemplating them, and our mind does not\nwish to move on to any successive intentional act. Since aesthetic\nappreciation requires such ecstatic arrests, we often suffer\n\u201caesthetic impotence\u201d, returning to an adored object and\nfinding ourselves unmoved by it. Such impotence may involve a past\noverestimation of the value of the object. But more often it involves\nan inability to recover youthful levels of concentration. One might\nconsider that Findlay\u2019s doctrine of \u201carrest\u201d before\nworks of art might explain \u201cmuseum fatigue\u201d, where walking\none hall in a museum can prove as tiring as hiking one mile in the\nwoods.\n8. Wittgenstein\n\nAs noted, Findlay met Wittgenstein in February 1930 and again in 1939.\nHis description of the first encounter, published in 1974, has been\nfrequently quoted by Wittgenstein\u2019s biographers (see, for\nexample, Bartley 1985: 192):\n\n\nAt the age of 40 he looked like a youth of 20, with a godlike beauty,\nalways an important feature at Cambridge. The God received him and\ngave him lunch in an ascetic room, beautiful in its almost total\nemptiness, where a wooden bowl of fruit on a table made one note of\ncolor. The God was all he had been described as being: he looked like\nApollo who had bounded into life out of his own statue, or perhaps\nlike the Norse God Baldur, blue-eyed and fair haired, with a beauty\nthat had nothing sensual about it, but simply breathed the four Greek\ncardinal virtues, to which was added a very exquisite kindness and\ngraciousness that bathed one like remote, slightly wintry\nsunshine\u2026 The tea that one drank with him tasted like nectar.\n(EQ: 173\u20134)\n\n\nFindlay was also a keen appreciator of Wittgenstein\u2019s prose\nstyle, and felt that some fraction of Wittgenstein\u2019s influence\nstemmed from the beauty of his German sentences, a beauty that an\nunwary reader might mistake for truth. Nevertheless, he freely\nacknowledged Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophical genius:\n\n\nOne could not listen to Wittgenstein\u2019s least pronouncements,\nhowever falteringly expressed, without feeling that they sprung from a\nmind of supreme integrity and the most penetrating insight. (W:\n24)\n\n\nand the threat it posed to his own work. If the Tractatus was\nright, his book on Meinong was wrong; if the Blue and Brown books were\nright, then Values and Intentions was misguided, if the\nPhilosophical Investigations (1953) got it right, the Gifford\nlectures were nonsense. The defensive result was Wittgenstein: a\nCritique, published in Findlay\u2019s eightieth year. \n\n\nI have returned to my own orbit as a result of learning to answer\nalmost all of Wittgenstein\u2019s rhetorical questions, which were\nintended to promote the answer \u201cYes\u201d, with the straight\nanswer \u201cNo\u201d.(EQ: 168) \n\n\nWittgenstein: A Critique reviews the Tractatus, the\nBlue and Brown books, Remarks on the Foundations of the\nMathematics, and the Investigations. The format is to take key\naphorisms from Wittgenstein, expound them at considerable length, and\nthen launch objections, which pile up as in a Thomistic\nSumma, but absent the replies. For example, against the\nTractatus, Findlay objects (1) \u201cUltimate simple\nobjects\u201d are not ontologically viable, whatever can be referred\nto must have an internal structure, and form part of a larger\nrelational structure; (2) \u201cThe restriction of all domains to the\nactually existent\u201d is to be rejected because it is always\nsignificant to suppose that this thing that exists, might have not\nexisted; (3) the view that \u201call necessities are logical\nnecessities\u201d is wrong because two atomic propositions can be\ninconsistent; (4) the axiom of extensionality is false because there\nare significant and true modal propositions; (5) not \u201call\nlogical necessities are tautological\u201d, since , e.g.,\n\u201cp\u201d and \u201cnot not p\u201d differ in\nsense; ( 6) the picture theory of language is wrong because meanings\nare connected to objects by intentional mental acts, not by\n\u201cmirroring\u201d (W: 222).\n\nHusserl\u2019s \u201cmeaning as intentionality\u201d theory is\nbrought to bear on the \u201cmeaning as use\u201d doctrine of the\nBlue and Brown books and Philosophical Investigations.\nFindlay remarks that he was shocked in 1939 when Wittgenstein admitted\nto him that he had already written a great deal about \u201cmental\nprocesses\u201d, while reading next to nothing of the great early\ntwentieth century experimental psychologists (SF: 31). So when\nWittgenstein mocked the story of the mind\u2019s eye viewing inner\nmental pictures, he was ignorant of Titchner\u2019s work on\n\u201cimageless thought;\u201d when he attacked introspection as\npseudo-science, he was ignorant of the careful and disciplined\nintrospective methods of K\u00fclpe and the W\u00fcrzburg school, and\nso forth. Many of Wittgenstein\u2019s targets are thus straw men.\n\nFindlay readily concedes that Wittgenstein is right that there is\nrarely a uniform inner experience that is invariably present in a\nspecific mental processes such as thinking or believing. But it is a\nmistake infer from the absence of uniform inner experiences that there\nare no inner experiences at all:\n\n\nWittgenstein denies the existence of specific experiences of\nintending, with equal correctness and incorrectness. There are\nintentions as poignantly experienced as the nailing of these to church\ndoors, and intentions distinguished only by the very faint note of\n\u201cto be doneness\u201d, as when we go up to someone and greet\nhim. (W: 39)\n\n\nAnd again:\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s dogmatic pronouncement may here be contrasted\nwith the vastly varied categorizations which introspective\npsychologists have brought into the examination of pain, as well as\ninto every other form of organic or kinesthetic sensation, using\nmetaphorical descriptions without stint, and often with great aptness.\n(W: 222)\n\n\nThese inner experiences are part of a general subjectivity that form\nthe background without which language cannot even arise; this\nbackground is a quasi-language of thought possessed to some degree by\nnon-human animals. \n\n\n[Wittgenstein] has rejected what seemed to him the idle pictures that\nmen fashion in going beyond the actual sues of language, but he has\ngiven us little understanding of what those actual uses are, and what\nthey ought to be. Blind acceptance of the uses of expression, without\na justifying ontology or experimental phenomenology, does not\nrecommend itself to the most na\u00efve user of words: they look for a\njustification of use, and they seek it beyond use. The falsifying,\nmerely pictorial element abounds in inner-life talk, but it will none\nthe less not do to throw out the baby of inner experience with the\nbath water of undisciplined diction (W: 252)\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s famous argument against \u201ca private\nlanguage\u201d, is set by Findlay in a special context. In the\nTractatus Wittgenstein endorses solipsism: there is even a\nexample of one eye contemplating a world that is entirely its own.\nFindlay argued that Wittgenstein not only preached solipsism; he lived\nit. \u201cWittgenstein, I consider, is one of the few and genuine\ncomplete solipsists who have ever existed\u201d (SF: 62). He believed\nthat he did not know what it is to be like someone other than\nWittgenstein, or that anyone else could gasp what his own life was\nlike.\n\n\nHis pervasive aestheticism certainly displayed a character that I\nbelieve, is technically describable as \u201cschizoid\u201d, there\nwas something, queer, detached, surreal, incompletely human about it.\nHis colorless simple objects are not things that one can touch and\nhandle, and his villagers who sell apples one by one taken from a\ndrawer, and then ritually count them as they are taken out, or who\nassure themselves that something is red by taking a named sample of\nred out of their pockets, are plainly the inhabitants of a dream or a\nnightmare, and not of a possible village. (W: 21)\n\n\nThe \u201cprivate language argument\u201d in this context, becomes\nan almost hysterical attempt to provide a public world and public\ncommunication between the separate selves of the Tractatus.\nTo insist (against private languages) that \u201cinner processes must\nhave outer criteria\u201d is not a problem for Findlay, who remained\na quasi-behaviorist to the end. The problem is to claim, as\nWittgenstein did, that in most cases outward criteria cannot be found,\nand to declare on this basis that inner processes are largely\nmythical. On Findlay\u2019s interpretation, Wittgenstein spent his\nyouthful years hiding his inner experiences, and then in later life\ninvented a philosophy that declared that he had nothing to hide.\n\nThe Wittgenstein wave has largely passed by, and Findlay\u2019s\nmultitudinous objections look a bit like overkill. Philosophy today\nhas rediscovered psychology, though it is the psychology of Kahneman\nand Tversky and Pylyshyn, not the psychology of Brentano or Titchner.\nBut Findlay\u2019s style of objecting to Wittgenstein, rather than\nignoring him, presupposes a common ground, and suggests a continuing\nrelevance of Wittgenstein\u2019s thought for the contemporary\nphilosophy of mind. \n\nTo close with an autobiographical passage: Findlay, a theosophist\nsurrounded by hostile logicians, seems to have found in Wittgenstein a\nkindred spirit: \n\n\nHe treated me with extraordinary graciousness, perhaps principally\nbecause he saw in me an inconsequential unbelongingness akin to his\nown. He gave me his then only copy of the first 150 sections of the\nPhilosophical Investigations to read! It is in the light of\nhis many kindnesses that I should wish this present, highly critical\nbook about his teachings to be regarded, not merely as a critique, but\nalso as a tribute.
