Practical Consequences: The Artist and the Community\n\n\u2018Theoretically\u2019, Collingwood says, \u2018the artist is a\nperson who comes to know himself, to know his own emotion\u2019\n(291). Despite this, however, Collingwood is anxious to show this does\nnot entail aesthetic solipsism, as if the artist need not ever concern\nhimself with others. Quite the opposite: necessarily the artistic\nachievement is collaborative, involving the audience and other\nartists.\n\nCollingwood begins his account of the relation between artist and\nspectator by saying that a spectator understands a given work just\ninsofar as his imaginative experience is identical with that had by\nthe artist in creating it. This can never be known with certainty, but\nso it is with all understanding of language (remember that\n\u2018language\u2019 in Collingwood\u2019s usage means all\nexpressive behaviour). It is also piecemeal: \u2018Understanding\n\u2026 is a complex business, consisting of many phases, each\ncomplete in itself but each leading on to the next\u2019 (311).\nCollingwood does speak of identity of understanding, but\nreally his real account is more fluid. First, he accepts that any\nutterance is endlessly interpretable; there no such thing as\n\u2018the\u2019 meaning of a work (ibid.). Second, the\naudience\u2019s role is collaborative, in the sense that the artist\nis concerned to express emotions that are mutually held; failure in\nthis may rightly cause the artist to doubt whether he expressed\nanything, and suffers instead from a \u2018corruption of\nconsciousness\u2019 as explained earlier. The audience, then,\nactively participates in re-creating the imaginative experience. This\nsecond point flows from his conception of art as a language:\n\nThe child learning his mother tongue, as we have seen, learns\nsimultaneously to be a speaker and to be a listener; he listens to\nothers speaking, and speaks to others listening. It is the same with\nartists. They become poets or painters or musicians not by some\nprocess of development from within, as they grow beards; but by living\nin a society where these languages are current. Like other speakers,\nthey speak to those who understand.\n (317)[1]\n\n\nCollingwood further dilutes the air of aesthetic solipsism by\nobserving that the artist never works alone; on the one hand the\nartist freely borrows from what has already been achieved, and on the\nother, at least in the performing arts, the players have their own\nessential role. A work of art is collaborative, not simply the\ncreation of an individual; the \u2018cult of individual genius\u2019\nis totally misplaced and indeed pernicious.\n",
