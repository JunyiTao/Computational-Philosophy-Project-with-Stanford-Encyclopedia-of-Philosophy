    "main_text": "Objections to the Representational Theory || Objections to the Nonactual\n4.1 Objections to the Nonactual\n\nSome philosophers are squeamish about the representationalist\u2019s\ncommitment to nonactual objects in cases of hallucination or\nperceptual illusion. For example, Loar (2003) imagines comparing the\nexperience of seeing a lemon and a subjectively indistinguishable case\nof hallucinating an exactly similar lemon. \u201cA way of putting\nthis is representational: the two experiences present the real lemon\nand a merely intentional object as exactly similar, and that is what\nmakes the experiences indistinguishable\u2026. At the same time, one\nhas a good sense of reality, and so wants to hold that the merely\nintentional lemon is nothing at all, and so not something that can\nresemble something else\u201d (p. 84). A similar sentiment is\nsympathetically attributed to Fred Dretske by Levine (2003, p. 59n).\nThe representational theory is sometimes assimilated to Alexius\nMeinong\u2019s fanciful view that along with the many things that\nactually exist, there are plenty of other things that are like the\nthings that exist except for happening to lack the property of\nexisting. (Thus, Mage exists but does not have wings; Pegasus lacked\nexistence but had wings.)\n\nBut it is important to see that the metaphysics of nonexistence is\neveryone\u2019s problem, not peculiarly that of the\nrepresentationalist (or of one\u2019s current opponent on whatever\nissue in the philosophy of mind). There are things that do not exist,\nsuch as a hallucinated pink rat or a hallucinated lemon. However\ntroublesome it is for fundamental ontology, that fact does not entail\nMeinong\u2019s exegesis of it, or David Lewis\u2019 concretist\ninterpretation, or any other particular metaphysical account of it.\nThe representational theory of sensory qualities is neutral on such\nunderlying issues; it says only that when you hallucinate a lemon, the\nyellowness you experience is that of the lemon. Of course, neither the\nlemon nor its color actually exists, but as before, there are plenty\nof things that do not exist. (And one should question whether, as Loar\nmaintains, nonactual things and people cannot resemble actual\nones.)\n",
