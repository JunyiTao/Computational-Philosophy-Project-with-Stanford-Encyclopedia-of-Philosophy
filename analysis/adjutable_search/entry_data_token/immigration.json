Arguments for Closed Borders\n1.1 Preserving Culture\n\n\nThe most popular argument for the permissibility and importance of\nclosing borders to outsiders is that this exclusion is necessary in\norder to preserve a state\u2019s distinctive culture. The appeal\nof cultural continuity is easy to appreciate. As David Miller\nexplains, \u201cthe public culture of their country is something that\npeople have an interest in controlling: they want to be able to shape\nthe way that their nation develops, including the values that are\ncontained in the public culture. They may not of course succeed:\nvalued cultural features can be eroded by economic and other forces\nthat evade political control. But they may certainly have good\nreason to try, and in particular to try to maintain cultural continuity\nover time, so that they can see themselves as the bearers of an\nidentifiable cultural tradition that stretches backward\nhistorically.\u201d (Miller 2005: 200) Think of the United\nStates, for instance. If the US placed no limits on immigration\nfrom Canada, it is clear neither how many Canadians would move south,\nnor whether their migration would have a discernible affect upon\nAmerican culture. If the United States did not limit immigration\nfrom Mexico, on the other hand, it seems almost certain that much\nlarger numbers of Mexicans would migrate north and that the changes to\nAmerican culture would be regarded by many as rapid and dramatic.\n(Huntington 2005) If so, it seems likely that open borders would\nquickly lead to changes that would leave many Americans less\ncomfortable in their own homeland. Given this, the concern to\npreserve one\u2019s native culture seems to provide a reasonable\njustification for restricting immigration.\n\n\nThis line of argument invites a number of empirical and moral\nquestions. Among the empirical questions, we might ask how\nconfident we can be about the numbers and influence of the potential\nimmigrants. Is the immigrants\u2019 culture really that\ndistinctive? And are we sure that these newcomers will resist\nassimilation? Also, how can we be sure that the cultural changes\nwill be rapid and detrimental? Skeptics of this line of argument\noften object that people tend to (1) exaggerate how\ndistinctive\u2014and distinctively valuable\u2014their existing\ncultures are (it is notoriously difficult to characterize\n\u201cAmerican\u201d culture, for instance), (2) irrationally fear\nchange, and (3) underestimate how much their culture is changing\nanyway, in the absence of immigration. Even if all of these\ndescriptive objections can be definitively answered, important moral\nchallenges remain. In particular, even if citizens have an\nunderstandable interest in maintaining cultural continuity, it\nremains an open question as to whether they have a corresponding moral\nright (and, if so, one might wonder about how weighty this right\nis). These questions matter, because outsiders may also have\ncompeting interests in, and/or rights to, enter the country in\nquestion, and thus they may permissibly be excluded only if the rights\nof insiders to preserve their cultural continuity outweigh any rights\nof foreigners to enter the political territory.\n\n\nFinally, even if each of these moral challenges could also be\nconclusively answered, this approach would not justify excluding all\noutsiders. At most, it could explain only why countries would be\nentitled to limit the flow of culturally distinct\nimmigrants. To put this point in terms of the United States, for\ninstance, even if the aim of preserving American culture would justify\nplacing limits on Mexican immigration, it would not seem to justify\nexcluding all Mexicans, let alone all Canadians.\n1.2 Sustaining the Economy\n\n\nAnother popular argument against open borders is that the influx of\nnewcomers will hurt the economy. In its most straightforward\nversion, this argument simply assumes that the domestic economy can\nsupport only a certain number of workers, but more nuanced renditions\nallege more specifically that at least some types of foreigners should\nbe excluded because, given the cultural differences between insiders\nand these particular outsiders, the inclusion of the latter would not\nbe conducive to economic growth (perhaps because these outsiders lack\nthe requisite work ethic, for instance).\n\n\nThe most common response to this argument is simply to contest that\nallowing immigrants will have negative economic consequences. It\nseems clear that some in the domestic economy may be harmed (typically\nthe less skilled workers disproportionately bear the brunt of the\ncosts, since they must now compete with immigrants whose presence\ndrives down wages), but the economy as a whole often benefits as (1)\nfirms are able to hire cheaper labor (and pass along correspondingly\nlower prices to consumers), and (2) there is an increased demand for\nvarious goods and services. More generally, even if a given\ndomestic economy might suffer if it did not restrict immigration,\neconomists tend to agree that the global economy as a whole would\nprofit from fewer restrictions on who can work where. (From an\npurely economic perspective, the inefficiencies of barring Africans\nfrom competing for work in European countries are costly, just as those\nwhich resulted from prohibiting women from working in a\n\u2018man\u2019s\u2019 job were.) This recognition that there\nwill inevitably be net winners and losers whenever a market restriction\nis lifted points toward the important moral question as to whether\nanyone has a moral right to the economic benefits of the status\nquo. For example, let us suppose that less skilled American\nlaborers would be harmed, whereas American firms and consumers along\nwith Mexican immigrants would benefit if the current restriction on\nMexican immigration were lifted. If so, then immigration would be\nimpermissible in this case only if the potentially displaced American\nworkers have a right not to face the increased competition for their\njobs (Macedo 2007).\n\n\nWe cannot presume that these domestic workers necessarily lack such\na right, but neither should we assume that they have it. What is\nmore, even if these workers have a right not to be harmed, it does not\nfollow that opening the economy to foreign workers must be\nimpermissible, at least if there were some way the workers could be\nadequately compensated for the costs that they disproportionately\nbear. (Think, for instance, of how the US government routinely\nprovides special unemployment and educational benefits to displaced\nworkers, like those in the textile industry, who lose their jobs as a\nconsequence of new legislation liberalizing trade with foreign\ncountries.) To be successful, then, the economic argument must be\nmuch more sophisticated than it might initially appear; in addition to\nestablishing that at least some people will incur economic losses,\nproponents of this approach must demonstrate that these victims have a\nmoral right to be spared these costs, a right for which they cannot be\nadequately compensated in other ways.\n1.3 Distributing State Benefits\n\n\nA related but distinct argument for closed borders focuses on the\ndistribution of state benefits like welfare payments and health\ninsurance. The basic idea here is that countries like Sweden and\nCanada, for instance, must limit immigration in order to sustain\nanything like their current provision of state benefits. If an\naffluent welfare state placed no restrictions on who could enter, then\nmasses of poor people from around the world would flock to this country\nin order to take advantage of its provision of health and welfare\nbenefits. Indeed, presumably so many would immigrate that there\nwould be no way for this state to continue distributing these benefits\nat anything like their current rate. Thus, given the existing\nlevels of global poverty, it appears as though you can have open\nborders or welfare states, but you cannot have both.\n\n\nIt seems hard to deny that rich welfare states like the Scandinavian\ncountries would be inundated with migrants if they lifted all\nrestrictions on immigration, but not everyone agrees that this fact\nnecessarily justifies keeping people out. A libertarian, for\ninstance, would likely regard this as just one more reason to abandon\nthe welfare state. That is, faced with the choice between either\nrespecting everyone\u2019s right to freedom of movement or designing\nstates that can effectively guarantee ample levels of health coverage\nand welfare transfers to their citizens, the libertarian would favor\nthe former. It is important to recognize, though, that these are\nnot the only two options; the best answer may lie in some middle ground\nbetween these two stark alternatives. In particular, perhaps\nexisting welfare states could open their borders to everyone and then\nprovide no, or at least delayed, welfare benefits to newcomers.\nImagine, for instance, if Sweden stipulated that immigrants would have\ntheir income and wealth taxed from the moment they entered the country,\nbut they would not become vested until they had contributed to the\nstate coffers for something like five years. If immigrants were\nforced to contribute during a waiting period, such an arrangement would\npresumably strengthen rather than jeopardize the host state\u2019s\ncapacity to provide state benefits. Thus, while some would no\ndoubt object to newcomers facing a period in which they were net\nlosers, this proposal at least shows that welfare states need not be\nincompatible with open borders.\n\n\nFinally, even if all attempts to square open borders with wealthy\nwelfare states are problematic, this argument does not support the\nright of all countries to design and enforce their own immigration\npolicies. More modestly, it would show only that wealthy welfare\nstates may do so as long as the world is characterized by profound\ninternational inequality.\n1.4 Political Functioning\n\n\nOne of the most sophisticated arguments on behalf of a state\u2019s\nright to close its borders is the liberal nationalist approach, which\nsuggests that liberal welfare states must exclude outsiders in order to\nfunction properly. This account emphasizes that states of this\nkind are able to operate as they do only because their citizens are\nwilling to make the enormous political sacrifices necessary to sustain\na vibrant democracy and equitable welfare state. What is more,\nthese citizens are inclined to freely sacrifice in these ways only\nbecause they identify with one another. Were it not for this\nfellow feeling among compatriots, far fewer would be motivated to\ninvest their personal energy in the democratic process or to give up a\nportion of their wealth in order to assist less fortunate fellow\ncitizens. And finally, this identification among compatriots\ndepends upon the existence of a shared culture (Miller 2014). \n\n\nThis liberal nationalist account invites all the usual\nquestions: Do liberal democracies really depend upon sufficient\ntrust and fellow-feeling among their compatriots, and, if so, is a\ncommon culture genuinely necessary to secure this trust and mutual\nconcern? Just how homogenous must such a culture be?\nLiberal democracies like the United States and Canada seem to operate\njust fine despite a great deal of cultural diversity, for\ninstance. In light of this, why worry that outsiders pose a\nsubstantial threat? Is it plausible to think that immigrants will\nnot assimilate to the requisite degree once they have settled in their\nnew state? And even if this account can in some cases justify\nexcluding culturally distinct foreigners, it would appear to provide no\ngrounds for limiting outsiders who share the requisite cultural\nattributes. Assuming that the answers to these empirical questions\nultimately vindicate the liberal nationalist account, tricky moral\nquestions remain. For instance, do the inhabitants of well-oiled\nliberal democracies have not only an interest, but a moral\nright to the exclusive protection afforded by their enviable\npolitical regimes? Finally, even if each of these questions can\nbe satisfactorily answered, this account applies solely to democratic\nwelfare states, and thus other types of states could not invoke this\nline of reasoning in defense of excluding outsiders.\n1.5 Establishing Security\n\n\nSince 9/11, an increasingly popular justification for limiting\nimmigration is the need to secure the safety of one\u2019s\ncitizens. After all, given the presence of international\nterrorists, one can hardly question the threat posed by at least some\nforeigners.\n\n\nNo one can deny the moral importance of protecting innocent\ncivilians from terrorist attack, but critics have questioned whether\nrestricting immigration is in fact likely to provide the desired\nsecurity. Chandran Kukathas (2014), for instance, raises two\nimportant concerns. First, he notes that, while laws to limit\nimmigration may well decrease legal immigration, they will not\nrealistically be able to eliminate all illegal immigrants. And\nthis point is relevant, of course, because foreign terrorists who feel\nso passionately about their causes so as to be willing to carry out\nterrorist missions are not likely to be dissuaded from doing so by the\nillegality of entering the country whose citizens they seek to\nattack. Second, even if a state could somehow eliminate all legal\nand illegal immigration, this would not be enough because foreigners\nroutinely enter countries, not as immigrants, but for shorter periods\nas tourists, guest workers, visiting students, or for short business\ntrips. Thus, even if a country somehow managed to preclude all\nimmigration, it could not reasonably hope to exclude all foreign\nterrorists unless it also restricted the flow of temporary\nvisitors.\n1.6 Political Self-Determination\n\n\nAnother account of a country\u2019s right to close its borders\nalleges that this right is merely one component of a state\u2019s more\ngeneral right to political self-determination (Walzer 1983; Pevnick 2011).\nSpecifically, some contend that a legitimate state\u2019s right\nto freedom of association entitles it to choose whether or not to admit\nany given immigrants (Wellman 2008). This type of argument\ninvolves three basic premises (1) legitimate states have a right to\npolitical self-determination, (2) freedom of association is an\nessential component of self-determination, and (3) freedom of\nassociation entitles one to refuse to associate with others.\nThus, just as we would consider it an egregious violation of an\nindividual\u2019s personal self-determination if she had no choice but\nto marry the suitor of her father\u2019s choice, for instance, we\nshould recognize that no political community is fully self-determining\nunless it has discretion over which potential immigrants to invite into\nits political community. According to this line of argument,\nthen, there is nothing mysterious or complicated about a\ncountry\u2019s right to screen applicants for admission: it is\nmerely a standard component of a state\u2019s more general right to\nself-determination.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways in which one might contest this line of\nargument (Fine 2010; Wellman and Cole 2011). Most obviously, one might\nquestion whether corporate political entities are even eligible for\nmoral rights.  Value-individualists, for instance, contend that only\nindividual persons ultimately matter morally, and thus, while\npolitical states may be extremely valuable instruments, they are\nmerely instruments and, as such, are not the type of entities to which\nwe can sensibly ascribe moral rights. Secondly, even if countries can\nsomehow qualify for moral rights, it seems far-fetched to liken a\ncountry\u2019s freedom of association with respect to immigrants to an\nindividual\u2019s right to refuse a marriage proposal, since presumably\nmarital freedom of association is incalculably more important to an\nindividual than her right to exclude potential compatriots. What is\nmore, it is not clear that the analogy between personal and political\nfreedom of association is even apt, because states that deny\nimmigrants do not merely refuse to politically associate with those\nwho seek to migrate, they also forcibly exclude them from the state\u2019s\nterritory.  Finally, even if all of these concerns could somehow be\naddressed, notice both that this argument purports to establish only\nthat legitimate states have a presumptive right to\nexclude outsiders. Both of these qualifications are important. The\ncondition that only legitimate states are morally entitled to be\nself-determining is significant because, given the plausible\nassumption that many existing states are illegitimate, this argument\nwould not justify the immigration policies of many current states. And\nthe fact that this argument would at best ground only a presumptive\nright to exclude outsiders is noteworthy, because it leaves open the\npossibility that this right could be over-ridden by the weightier\nrights various foreigners may have to be admitted. If a refugee needs\nto gain entrance in order to escape persecution or a child needs to be\nadmitted in order to reunite with her mother, for instance, then\ndefenders of political self-determination cannot antecedently assume\nthat the legitimate state\u2019s right to freedom of association\nnecessarily trumps these individuals\u2019 claims.\n1.7 Democracy\n\n\nDemocratic governance provides another potential link between\nself-determination and controls on immigration. Given that\ndemocracy\u2019s principal virtue is thought to be its connection to\nself-determination, democrats often favor bounded groups which enjoy\ndominion over their own affairs. As Frederick Whelan puts it,\n\u201cdemocracy requires that people be divided into\npeoples (each people hopefully enjoying its own democratic\ninstitutions), with each unit distinguishing between its own\ncitizens\u2014understood in a political sense as those eligible to\nexercise democratic political rights here\u2014and others,\nwho are regarded as aliens here, although (hopefully) citizens\nsomewhere else.\u201d (Whelan 1988: 28) The basic idea here is\nthat, in order for democracies to function, there must be rule\nby the same people upon whom the rule is imposed. But\nthis is possible only if the same group of individuals who first vote\nare subsequently bound by the outcome. If membership constantly\nfluctuated, however, then self-determination would not occur, because\nthe \u201cself\u201d that votes would not match the\n\u201cself\u201d which is then bound by the results.\n\n\nIn response, theorists like Phillip Cole (2000) have suggested at\nleast two grounds on which we might question whether democracy requires\nclosed borders. First, even if Whelan is right that democracy\ncannot function properly unless we sort people into territorially\ndefined groups (What is wrong with a democratic world state, for\ninstance?), why does it follow that the constituents within any given\nset of territorial boundaries must have control over admissions?\nCiting local and regional democratic units within larger federal\nstructures as counterexamples, Coles suggests that \u201c[i]t seems\nclear that democratic rights can be confined to a region, with people\nentering and leaving that region freely and exercising the local\ndemocratic rights during their residency.\u201d (Cole 2000: 184)\nSecond, Cole suggests that one of the chief reasons to insist upon\ndemocracy in the first place is presumably the belief that coercive\npolitical institutions could not permissibly be imposed unless those\ncoerced are given an equal say in how the political arrangements are\nordered. But if so, this makes extending suffrage to only those\nalready within the territorial boundaries objectionable, because, as\nCole reminds us, \u201cthere are two groups subjected to the laws of\nthe state: its own members, and those non-members who are\napplying for inclusion.\u201d (Cole 2000: 186) Thus, because\nexclusive immigration laws are coercively imposed upon foreigners who\nseek to enter, democratic principles suggest that these outsiders\nshould also have a say in immigration laws. So if Cole is right,\nthe democratic case for closed borders is doubly problematic. Not\nonly is it false that open borders is inconsistent with a functioning\ndemocracy, democratic principles may even prohibit a state\u2019s\ncoercively excluding disenfranchised foreigners from entering its\nterritory.\n1.8 Jurisdiction\n\n\nThe jurisdictional theory of immigration emphasizes that, while\npolitical states are morally required to respect everyone\u2019s human\nrights, they are obligated to protect the rights of only those\nwithin their territory.  Given this, whenever someone moves to a new\nstate, the citizens of the receiving country become responsible for\nthis newcomer in a way that they were not before her arrival.  It\nwould thus seem weird to suppose that everyone should be free to move\nto whatever country they like, because this would entitle each of us\nto unilaterally impose moral responsibilities upon others.  If we\nvalue individual liberty, then we should begin with at least a\npresumption against others being at liberty to unilaterally foist\nthese responsibilities on us (Blake 2013).  Our immunity against\nunwelcome obligations may not be absolute, but it would presumably\nrequire a compelling competing consideration to outweigh it.  If\nsomeone could not enjoy sufficient protection of her human rights\nunless she moved to Canada, for instance, then this vulnerable person\nmay be entitled to immigrate without permission even though this move\nwill saddle Canadian citizens with moral duties to which they did not\nconsent.  But if someone whose rights are adequately respected\nelsewhere sought to move to Canada merely because she thinks she would\nbe happier there, Canadians would be well within their rights to\nforcibly exclude her if they would prefer not to be responsible for\nprotecting her human rights. \n\n\nThose who think that there is a natural duty to support just\ninstitutions may question the pivotal premise in this approach: that\nwe should be skeptical of political obligations to which we have not\nconsented.  After all, if each of us was really immune from political\nduties to which we did not consent, then many of us would not have\nduties to protect the human rights of our compatriots.  But if we must\ndo our part of the collective chore of protecting the human rights of\nour fellow citizens despite the fact that we never agreed to do so,\nwhy think that there is anything distinctively problematic about our\nsimilarly having such duties to newcomers who have recently\nimmigrated?  Indeed, given that we are already morally encumbered with\nduties to protect the human rights of those within our state\u2019s\nterritorial boundaries, an influx of newcomers does not create any new\ntypes of duties, at most it creates additional tokens which would make\nfulfilling these responsibilities more costly (Kates and Pevnick\n2014).  \n\n\nIn response, an advocate of the jurisdictional approach might counter\nthat prospective immigrants have no right to unilaterally act in ways\nthat make our natural duties more demanding.  But retreating to this\nposition raises new questions.  Given that immigrants also contribute\nto the state\u2019s performance of its political functions, it is not\nobvious why an influx of prospective immigrants would necessarily make\nit more difficult for those already present to fulfill their political\nobligations.  (Indeed, given economies of scale, the newcomers may\noften lighten the load of the native population.)  And even if there\nare instances in which the arrival of immigrants would create net\ncosts for a state\u2019s existing population, this fact would generate a\nright to forcibly exclude outsiders only if the increased demands upon\nthose already present should be given moral precedence over the costs\nimposed upon prospective immigrants who are denied entry.  Because\nprospective immigrants often have pressing interests in entering a\ncountry (even if their human rights are satisfactorily protected),\nhowever, there may be many cases in which the interests of those who\nwant to enter would prevail over a native population\u2019s desire to avoid\nmore costly political responsibilities (Kates and Pevnick 2014).  \n1.9 Realism\n\n\nThough less popular than it once was, international relations was\nonce dominated by realists who argued that political states are not\nconstrained by morality in their dealings with foreign states and\nindividuals. The basic idea motivating this approach was most\noften the Hobbesian presumption that morality consists solely of\ncontracts which are binding only in the presence of a sovereign who\ncould enforce them. And since there is no world sovereign capable\nof punishing states, the latter cannot be morally bound by any putative\ncontracts which purport to apply to them. As a consequence,\nrealists have traditionally supposed that states will and should orient\ntheir dealings with foreigners in whatever fashion maximally suits\ntheir national interests. And if this is correct, there can be no\nduties of any kind owed to foreign states or individuals, and thus no\nduty to open one\u2019s borders to foreigners.\n\n\nMany are reluctant today to endorse realism, in part because they\nreject the Hobbesian approach to morality, but also because they\nbelieve that states can be held accountable even in the absence of a\nsingle, global sovereign. Given this, theorists typically feel no\nneed to defeat the realist case for closed borders. It is worth\nnoting, however, that the permissibility of closed borders does not\nautomatically follow from realism, because (more) open borders may be\nin a country\u2019s national interest. It is not just that any\ngiven country might stand to benefit in various ways from immigration,\nit may also be that a country\u2019s own citizens have rights which\nrequire the state\u2019s borders to be porous. If individuals\nhave property rights which entitle them to invite foreigners onto their\nland or rights to freedom of association which entitle them to\nassociate domestically with foreigners, for instance, then a country\nmay well be duty-bound to allow open immigration even if it owes no\nmoral duties to outsiders.\n1.10 Indirect Cosmopolitanism\n\n\nBecause cosmopolitans value all people equally, they often argue in\nfavor of (more) open borders. Given that the life of a Western\nEuropean is no more valuable than that of a sub-Saharan African, for\ninstance, how can we justify a geo-political arrangement in which\npeople are effectively forced to remain in their country of birth when\nsorting humans according to this (morally arbitrary) criterion has such\na profound effect upon their chances of living a minimally decent\nlife? After all, it is a matter of brute luck where one is born,\nso neither the Europeans nor the Africans can plausibly be said to\ndeserve their relatively good/bad life prospects.\n\n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that embracing\ncosmopolitanism does not necessarily require one to endorse open\nborders, because one might develop an \u2018indirect\ncosmopolitan\u2019 defense for protecting a state\u2019s right to\nexclude outsiders. Such an account might take any number of\nforms, but one particularly interesting version is to suggest that\nwealthy liberal democratic states must be allowed to exclude foreigners\n(for the time being, at least) so as to be better able (and more\nwilling) to build the international institutions which are most likely\nto put the world\u2019s poor in a better position to live minimally\ndecent lives (Christiano, 2008).\n\n\nThis approach begins with the plausible premise that people like\nthose currently enduring absolute poverty in sub-Saharan Africa will\nlikely continue to be vulnerable to horrifically corrupt and\nincompetent domestic governance until the larger geo-political context\nis dramatically improved via the construction of international\ninstitutions, like the International Criminal Court. And if these\ninternational institutions are going to be created/reformed/made more\neffective in the foreseeable future, it will be predominantly by\nwealthy, liberal democracies. These states will be able and\nwilling to undertake this task, however, only if their domestic\neconomies, cultures and political environments are relatively safe and\nsecure, and this requires that they be free from worries about massive\nunwanted immigration. Thus, for the indefinite future we should\ngrant states the right to design and enforce their own immigration\npolicies, not because the constituents of wealthy liberal democratic\ncountries are necessarily morally entitled to their current high levels\nof wealth and security, but because denying states such a right will\nalmost surely undermine the prospects that these regimes will be able\nand willing to construct the larger, international mechanisms which, in\nturn, will provide the best long term chances of substantially\nimproving the lot of the world\u2019s poorest denizens.\n\n\nAn argument as elaborate as this one obviously depends upon a number\nof controversial premises about the best, most realistic way to help\nthe world\u2019s poor and the likely future conduct of wealthy liberal\ndemocracies. It is also important to recognize that, even if each\nof these claims is accurate, this argument does not establish the type\nof conclusion that many defenders of closed borders might want.\nThis is for two reasons. First, rather than establish a\nstate\u2019s moral right to exclude outsiders, it would seem to show\nat most that we should treat states as if they had this moral\nright by, for instance, respecting their international legal right to\ndesign and enforce their own immigration policies. Second, this\nargument\u2019s conclusion would not hold indefinitely; rather, the\nargument would apply only until the desired international institutions\nwere constructed. Once the geo-political environment was suitably\nrepaired, this particular argument would no longer provide any reasons\nto resist open borders. Of course, most cosmopolitans will regret\nneither of these features of this argument, but many who seek to defend\na state\u2019s right to exclude outsiders may well be considerably\nless sanguine about such limitations.\n2. Arguments for Open Borders\n2.1 Cosmopolitan Egalitarianism\n\n\nThe cosmopolitan egalitarian case for open borders combines the core\nmoral insight that all human beings, whether they are compatriots or\nforeigners, are equally deserving of moral consideration with the\ncentral empirical observation that one\u2019s country of birth often\nhas a profound impact upon one\u2019s life prospects. The\nstaggering levels of international inequality would not be so\nobjectionable if the typical Swede had done something to deserve a\nbetter life than the typical Chadian, for instance, but the truth, of course, is that\nSwedes were merely lucky to have been born in Sweden rather than\nChad. And given this, what justification could the Swedes have\nfor putting guns at their borders to deter Chadians from trying to move\nnorth and take advantage of the preferable social, political and\neconomic environment? In the eyes of cosmopolitan egalitarians,\nthey have none. As Joseph Carens puts it, \u201cCitizenship in\nWestern liberal democracies is the modern equivalent to feudal\nprivilege\u2014an inherited status that greatly enhances one\u2019s\nlife chances. Like feudal birthrights privileges, restrictive\ncitizenship is hard to justify when one thinks about it closely.\u201d\n(Carens 1987: 252) In other words, egalitarians regard open\nborders as the requisite response to the enormous economic inequalities\nwhich currently exist between countries.\n\n\nThis case for open borders presumes a specific, highly contentious\nversion of cosmopolitan egalitarianism. Thus, if one were not an\negalitarian (or, more specifically, if one were not a so-called\n\u201cluck\u201d egalitarian who believes that justice requires that\nwe correct for all inequalities which stem merely from luck), or if\none denied that egalitarian (or at least luck egalitarian)\nconsiderations extend beyond one\u2019s political borders, then one would\nbe unmoved by this argument. More importantly, even if one accepts all\nof the cosmopolitan egalitarian\u2019s moral premises, it is not clear that\nthe desired conclusion follows. This is because wealthy states seem to\nhave other ways to fulfill their duties of distributive justice. Even\nif Sweden has demanding duties of distributive justice to Chad, for\ninstance, why may Sweden not keep its borders closed as long as it\ntransfers the requisite amount to Chad? That is certainly how we\nhandle duties of distributive justice in the domestic realm. Consider\nJeff Bezos, for instance.  While there are various accounts of Bezos\u2019s\nduties to share his wealth with those who are less fortunate, no one\nsupposes that he must remarry, adopt or otherwise open his family to a\npoor person.  Rather, whatever he must transfer to others, everyone\nagrees that he can exclude others from his home life as long as he\nfulfills his duties of distributive justice.  And if duties of\ndistributive justice do not undermine an individual\u2019s right to freedom\nof association in the domestic realm, why need they do so for a state\nin the international arena? If Jeff Bezos need not open his home to\nthose who are less fortunate, then why must Sweden welcome poor\nforeigners into their political community?\n2.2 Libertarianism\n\n\nWhen one thinks of the individual rights which conflict with a\nstate\u2019s control over immigration, an outsider\u2019s right to\nfreedom of movement is likely to come to mind. As Joseph Carens\nreminds us, though, the rights of insiders are also limited when the\npolitical community as a whole has dominion over immigration. As\nhe explains, \u201cSuppose a farmer from the United States wanted to\nhire workers from Mexico. The government would have no right to\nprohibit him from doing this. To prevent the Mexicans from coming\nwould violate the rights of both the American farmer and the Mexican\nworkers to engage in voluntary transactions.\u201d (Carens 1987:\n253) Thus, a state\u2019s exclusive immigration policy is doubly\ndisrespectful of individual rights, because it interferes with both an\noutsider\u2019s freedom of movement and an insider\u2019s property\nright to unilaterally invite foreigners onto her land.\n\n\nThe libertarian is right to suggest that a state\u2019s dominion over\nimmigration is inconsistent with individuals having unlimited rights\nin this domain, but it is not clear why we should presume that the\nindividual\u2019s right must always prevail. Certainly the\nstate\u2019s right would be over-ridden if individual rights were\nalways perfectly general and absolute, but this construal of moral\nrights is implausible. A person\u2019s right to freedom of movement\ndoes not give her the right to enter my house without my permission,\nfor instance, so why must we assume that it gives her a right to enter\nmy country\u2019s territory without first getting the permission of\nthe political community as a whole? One could make a similar point\nabout a property owner\u2019s rights over her land. A property owner\nwould have the right to unilaterally invite foreigners onto her land\nif property rights were general and absolute, but most eschew this\naccount of property. Few would say that each property owner has a\nright to unilaterally enforce the criminal law on her own land, for\ninstance, and if property owners must defer to the state as a whole\nwhen it comes to the enforcement of criminal law, why must it be any\ndifferent for the immigration of foreigners?\n2.3 Democracy\n\n\nAs was explained above, Phillip Cole has offered reasons to question\nthe view that democratic governance depends upon there being closed\nborders. More recently, though, Arash Abizadeh (2008) has\nextended this reasoning to argue that democratic principles are\nactually incompatible with a state\u2019s right to unilaterally\nexclude outsiders. As he puts it, \u201canyone who accepts a\ngenuinely democratic theory of political legitimation domestically is\nthereby committed to rejecting the unilateral domestic right to control\nand close the state\u2019s boundaries\u2026\u201d (Abizadeh 2008:\n38) His argument involves two core premises, one moral and the\nsecond descriptive. The moral premise is his construal of the\ndemocratic justification thesis, which stipulates that a state\u2019s\ncoercive presence is illegitimate unless it is democratically justified\nto everyone coerced. The second premise is merely the descriptive\nobservation that a state coerces foreigners when it forcibly prevents\nunwelcome immigrants from entering the state\u2019s territory.\nIn light of these two points, Abizadeh concludes that a state may not\nunilaterally exclude outsiders; it can permissibly adopt an exclusive\nimmigration policy only if it democratically justifies this practice to\noutsiders. In other words, it would be impermissible for a state\nto forcibly restrict outsiders without first giving these outsiders a\nvote in the referendum which decided whether or not to adopt this\nrestrictive immigration policy.\n\n\nCorresponding to the two central premises, there are two ways to\ncontest this line of reasoning. First and most obviously, one\nmight follow David Miller\u2019s lead and deny that forcibly\nrestricting immigration actually coerces outsiders in the morally\nrelevant sense (Miller 2010). Even if one concedes that\npotential immigrants are coerced, though, one might doubt that coercion\ncannot be permissible in the absence of democratic justification.\nTo appreciate the appeal of this second strategy, imagine that two\ncriminals want to enter my house and help themselves to my copy of\nMichael Walzer\u2019s Spheres of Justice. It seems\ncrazy to think that I may not take proportionate steps to coercively\nrepel them without first putting my planned resistance up to a vote\namong the three of us. And if I do not need to democratically\njustify my coercively protecting my right to keep strangers out of my\nhouse, why think that a state must democratically justify its attempts\nto keep uninvited foreigners out of its political community? Of\ncourse, a defender of this type of democratic case for open borders\nmight counter that, unlike a legitimate owner of private property, the\nconstituents of a state have no dominion over the state\u2019s\nterritory, but this response would be available only if it could be\nshown that a state\u2019s constituents lack the relevant moral\nstanding over the political territory in question.\n2.4 Utilitarianism\n\n\nFinally, the utilitarian case for open borders stresses that\nrestricting freedom of movement leads to obvious inefficiencies and is\ntherefore impermissible. There are any number of ways in which it\nis suboptimal to forcibly restrain people within territorial\nboundaries, but one of the most obvious worries is that it is\neconomically inefficient. Restricting Mexicans from fully\ndeveloping and capitalizing upon their talents in the United States\neconomy, for instance, makes no more sense than relegating men and\nwomen into separate spheres. Just as a system in which only men\nmay be doctors and only women may work as nurses unjustifiably deprives\nthe world of countless excellent female doctors and male nurses, a\ngeo-political system in which countries are entitled to exclude\noutsiders regrettably fails to capitalize upon the talents and work\nethic of foreigners who are denied access to the world\u2019s most\nrobust labor markets. Given this, it seems reasonable to believe\nthat people would on average be much better off if there were no\nrestrictions on immigration.\n\n\nThis argument can be contested on either empirical or moral\ngrounds. For instance, without questioning whether restricting\nimmigration is in some ways inefficient, one might still defend the\nmerits of dividing the globe into separate states, each of which has\nsovereign control over its territory. This view seems plausible\nif the advantages to such a state system outweigh the inefficiencies in\nquestion. For instance, David Miller (2005) argues that\nrestrictions on immigration improve our ability effectively to address\npopulation control. As Miller recognizes, we will make progress\nin this regard only if leaders in countries like India and China are\nable and willing to enact the relatively unpopular laws necessary to\nlimit population growth. And these laws would be met with much\nmore resistance than they already are if there were no restrictions on\nmigration, because the costs of population growth would not be wholly\ninternalized. If a country\u2019s exploding population were free\nto move anywhere in the world, for instance, then its citizens would\nnot bear the full costs of population growth and would therefore be\nthat much more resistant to laws designed to limit the number of\nchildren born. If Miller is right, the advantages of restricting\nimmigration may more than compensate for the costs involved.\n\n\nFor the sake of argument, though, let us suppose that the gains of\nopen borders would be greater than the costs. Even so, it is\nnot clear that the utilitarian case for open borders is decisive,\nsince, as a moral matter, it may be that states have the right to\norganize their affairs in a suboptimal fashion. Most believe that\nparents would retain the right to raise their natural children in\nexclusive, nuclear families even if Plato were right that it would be\npreferable if a community\u2019s children were raised together by the\ncommunity as a whole. And if we think, contra utilitarianism,\nthat individuals are entitled to arrange their lives in suboptimal ways\nin the domestic sphere, why presume that political states lack the\nanalogous right to organize themselves as they see fit in the\ngeo-political context? Even if it were true that Norway and the\nEuropean Union would be better off if the former joined this regional\nbody as a full member, for instance, it seems to many that Norway\nshould have the right to refrain from joining this Union. And if\nNorway has the right to (inefficiently) refuse to associate fully with\nthe European Union, it might also be entitled to (inefficiently) refuse\nto associate with various individuals who would like to join\nNorway\u2019s political community.\n3. Applied Questions in Immigration\n\n\nAs the preceding discussion shows, there are a variety of promising\narguments in favor of a state\u2019s right to control immigration and many\nstrong considerations which suggest that countries are obligated to\nmaintain open borders. While some arguments are more popular than\nothers, critical questions can be raised about each of them.  Rather\nthan try to decisively defend either side here, let us conclude by\nbriefly surveying some of the more engaging applied issues related to\nthe morality of immigration. These include the definition and moral\nclaims of refugees, the conditions under which one may hire guest\nworkers, the permissibility of recruiting skilled professionals from\npoor countries where individuals with these talents are already in\nshort supply, the rights of irregular migrants, and what kinds of\nselection criteria a country may use to distinguish among applicants\nfor immigration\n3.1 Refugees\n\n\nThe 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a\nrefugee as someone who \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being\npersecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a\nparticular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country\nof his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is\nunwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201d\n(Article 1A[2]) Critics like Andrew Shacknove (1985) have\nquestioned this definition on at least three grounds. First, why\nfocus exclusively on victims of group-based persecution? And even\nif we do think in terms of groups, why restrict ourselves to these\nparticular groups? What if someone is persecuted qua\nwoman or qua homosexual, for instance? Second, given the\nvariety of threats to living a minimally decent human life, why insist\nthat only those vulnerable to persecution can qualify as\nrefugees? What about so-called \u201ceconomic refugees\u201d or\npeople fleeing a civil war, for instance? Third, why stipulate\nthat someone who is not \u201coutside the country of his\nnationality\u201d cannot be a refugee? What if an individual is\nbeing detained at the border or simply lacks the means to migrate\nwithout assistance, for example?\n\n\nShacknove speculates that this narrow understanding of refugees is\nlikely the consequence of real-world political pressures from leaders\nwho are wary of the international legal obligations that would follow\nfrom a more expansive definition. As he puts it,\n\u201c\u2026states reason in reverse from their fear that they will\nbe forced to shoulder the burden of assisting refugees unilaterally to\na narrow conception of refugeehood which limits the number of\nclaimants.\u201d (Shacknove 1985: 277) Whether one accepts the\ninternational legal definition or lobbies on behalf of a more expansive\nconception, however, there is broad-based support for the view that\nrefugees constitute a special category of potential immigrants who\npossess particularly urgent claims to admittance. Thus, while\ntheorists may vehemently disagree as to whether a country has a right\nto design and enforce its own immigration policies, even those who\naffirm a state\u2019s general right to exclude foreigners typically\nmake an exception in the case of refugees. It is one thing for\nthe United States to refuse to admit a Russian ballerina who would like\nto study and perform in New York, for instance, but is another thing\naltogether for it to turn away a political dissident who rightly fears\npersecution by the oppressive regime in her home state. In the\nlatter case, the dire nature of the refugee\u2019s circumstances are\nthought to give her a pressing claim which trumps whatever presumptive\nright a state generally has to reject hopeful immigrants. More\nrecently, however, some have come to question this line of\nthinking. Few suggest that a state has no duties to imperiled\nforeigners, but theorists increasingly question whether a state\u2019s\nduty to assist refugees must come in the form of admitting them.\nConsider the Kurds in Northern Iraq, for instance. Given the\nabuses they suffered under Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule, many would\nargue they should have qualified as refugees. One way to offer\nassistance would have been to provide them refuge in various foreign\ncountries. But as history shows, this was not the only way to\nhelp. Another option was to protect the Kurds where they lived,\nby securing a safe-haven fortified by a no-fly zone in Northern\nIraq. (A third possible option might be for rich countries to pay\npoorer countries to admit the refugees.) Of course, for a variety\nof reasons, countries might prefer not to intervene in the affairs of a\nforeign state, but the important point is the more general lesson that,\neven if we take for granted that stable, wealthy countries can have\nstringent duties to refugees, it does not follow that these duties must\nbe paid in the currency of open borders.\n3.2 Guest Workers\n\n\nThe classic analysis of guest workers is Michael Walzer\u2019s\ndiscussion of Western European countries\u2019 former practice of\nhiring laborers from nearby states such as Turkey. This practice\nwas a sensible solution for all, since it enabled a country like West\nGermany to hire foreign workers to do various relatively onerous jobs\nfor considerably less than it would have had to pay its domestic labor\nforce, and the imported laborers also profited, as they were able to\nearn considerably more than they could have in their own\ncountries. Walzer objects to this practice, however, because\nthese workers were not given equal political status in their host\ncountries. Even when Turkish workers lived in West Germany with\ntheir families for many years, for instance, they would have no chance\nof acquiring German citizenship. For understandable reasons,\nWalzer is deeply troubled by the creation of this political\nunderclass. As he puts it, \u201cThese guests experience the\nstate as a pervasive and frightening power that shapes their lives and\nregulates their every move\u2014and never asks for their\nopinion. Departure is only a formal option; deportation, a\ncontinuous practical threat. As a group, they constitute a\ndisenfranchised class. They are typically exploited or oppressed\nas a class as well, and they are exploited or oppressed at least in\npart because they are disenfranchised, incapable of organizing\neffectively for self-defense.\u201d (Walzer 1983: 59) As a\nconsequence, Walzer insists that, while countries are perfectly within\ntheir rights to either hire or exclude foreign workers, they are not\nfree to bring in outsiders without according them all the standard\nrights and privileges of equal citizenship. Thus, if a country is\nwilling to embrace foreign workers as political equals, it may invite\nin as many as it would like. If a political community is\nunwilling to treat guest workers as equals, on the other hand, then it\nmay not hire them and must pay the higher wages demanded by the\ndomestic labor market.\n\n\nPolitical theorists typically take for granted that states must\ntreat all of their constituents as free and equal, so it is no wonder\nthat so many are attracted to Walzer\u2019s analysis of guest\nworkers. (And it should be noted that countries like Germany have\nsince dramatically revised their guest worker policies, so that they\nare now much more in accord with Walzer\u2019s recommendations.)\nStill, at least two big questions present themselves. First, even\nif we assume that Walzer is correct that long-term visitors like those\nemployed in Western European countries must eventually be given the\nopportunity to become citizens, it does not follow that all guest\nworkers must be treated as equal citizens. What if Walzer were to\nspend a year as a Visiting Professor at the Sorbonne, for\nexample? Would this arrangement be morally impermissible if the\noffer did not give Walzer full voting rights in France for that\nyear? Presumably not. If so, then there are interesting and\ndifficult questions about how long and under what conditions one can\nwork in a foreign country without the standard rights and privileges of\nequal citizenship before one becomes objectionably treated as a\npolitical subordinate.\n\n\nSecond and more important, even if we presume that political states\nmust generally treat their constituents as free and equal\ncitizens, it is controversial whether this requirement should apply in\nthe case of guest workers. Because most accept the principle of\nvolenti non fit injuria, it is typically presumed that a\nrelationship among unequals need not be unjust, especially if both\nparties freely consent to the relationship. There need not be\nanything unjust about an arrangement in which an employee has a much\nless desirable set of powers, privileges and responsibilities than her\nemployer, for instance, as long as the employee freely and with full\ninformation accepted these terms of employment. Of course,\npolitical states are still required to treat their constituents as free\nand equal citizens precisely because the volenti principle is\ngenerally irrelevant to relations among compatriots. In other\nwords, states coerce all those within their territorial boundaries\nwhether or not these constituents have consented to this imposition;\nand, given this, they cannot invoke volenti and thus have no\nchoice but to treat everyone coerced as equals. Importantly,\nthough, guest workers are an exception to this general rule precisely\nbecause they do give their consent to the relationship.\nUnlike most of the state\u2019s constituents, guest workers are not\ncoerced by the adoptive state unless they decide that they would like\nto accept the terms of employment and move to the new country. As a\nconsequence, it is not clear that the volenti principle should\nnot apply in the case of guest workers.\n3.3 Recruiting Immigrants\n\n\nThe vast bulk of the discussion concerning the morality of\nimmigration concerns the exclusion of outsiders, but some also worry\nabout the way in which wealthy countries currently admit skilled\nworkers from poorer states, especially when the specialists are\nactively recruited away from their native lands. This practice\nwould not garner the attention of moral theorists if it were restricted\nto countries like the United States targeting the most talented\nlong-distance runners from Kenya, for instance, but it is thought to\nrise to the level of injustice when the wealthiest countries actively\nrecruit professionals from developing countries where people with their\nskill sets are already in terribly short supply. Perhaps the most\nnoteworthy and worrisome instance of this is the manner in which\nwealthy, western states actively recruit medical professionals away\nfrom Africa. As Gillian Brock comments, \u201cArguably, it is\nnot the total number of health care professionals that exist in the\nworld today that is a problem, but rather their distribution.\nConsider how, for instance, while only 21 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation resides in Europe and North America, it commands 45 per cent\nof the world\u2019s doctors and 61 of its nurses. Africa, which\ncontains 13 per cent of the world\u2019s population, has only 3 per\ncent of its doctors and 5 per cent of its nurses. An estimated\n1.3 per cent of the world\u2019s health care workers provide services\nto 13.8 per cent of the world\u2019s population in a region suffering\n25 per cent of the world\u2019s disease burden.\u201d (Brock 2009:\n200)\n\n\nGiven both the relative shortage of health care professionals in\nAfrica and the fact that many posit a human right to a decent minimum\nlevel of health care, the recruitment (if not the mere admission) of\ndoctors and nurses from developing countries would seem to raise human\nrights issues. An obvious response, then, would be to issue a\nblanket prohibition on the emigration of health care professionals from\ncountries where they are in desperately short supply. This\nextreme measure strikes many as problematic, though, for the way in\nwhich it curtails the individual liberty of the skilled workers in the\npoor countries. A more subtle response, then, would be to insist\nonly that the adoptive countries provide adequate compensation to the\nstates from which the talented individuals emigrate. Thus, just\nas those who worry about deforestation urge that all those who chop\ndown mature trees should be held responsible for planting even more\nyoung trees in their place, authors like Brock (2009) suggest that it\nwould not be too much to ask those countries who admit skilled workers\nfrom countries where they are already in short supply to provide\ncompensatory resources which will assist these poor countries in their\nfuture efforts to train and retain the next generation of such\nprofessionals.\n3.4 Irregular Migrants\n\n\nFollowing Joseph Carens (2013), I call those who have settled in a\nforeign country without authorization (who some label\n\u201cundocumented\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants) \nirregular migrants. Irregular migrants pose vexing moral\nquestions even for those who are convinced that states have the right\nto control immigration, because many believe that over time an\nirregular migrant can gradually acquire a moral right to stay (and\nperhaps even to full and equal citizenship), despite the fact that she\nhad no right to migrate without authorization in the first place. \nCarens articulates this sentiment nicely when he writes:\n\n\nThe moral right of states to apprehend and deport irregular migrants\nerodes with the passage of time. As irregular migrants become\nmore and more settled, their membership in society grows in moral\nimportance, and the fact that they have settled without authorization\nbecomes correspondingly less relevant. At some point a threshold\nis crossed, and they acquire a moral claim to have their actual social\nmembership legally recognized. They should acquire a legal right\nof permanent residence and all the rights that go with that, including\neventual access to citizenship. (Carens 2013: 150)\n\n\nGiven the psychological importance of social membership and the fact\nthat (authorized or not) a migrant will typically become deeply\nsocially imbedded in her new society after a prolonged period, the\nappeal of this judgment is easy to appreciate. Critics might counter,\nhowever, that this account wrongly presumes that psychological\nattachment is sufficient to generate moral entitlement. To see why one\nmight doubt this, imagine that I grow incredibly attached to the Mona\nLisa during the ten years that it takes for the authorities to\ndiscover that I am the one who stole it from the Louvre. No matter how\nattached I become to the painting (and regardless of how\npsychologically difficult it will be for me to find happiness in my\nnew life without it), most would presumably deny that I have therefore\nacquired a right to retain the stolen painting. And given that we are\nso resistant to suppose that the right of authorities to reclaim the\nMona Lisa and return it to the Louvre erodes with the passage of time,\nperhaps we should similarly be suspicious of the notion that the\n\u201cmoral right of states to apprehend and deport irregular migrants\nerodes with the passage of time\u201d (as in the quote from Carens\nabove). \n\n\nOne exception to this line of thought may be the children of irregular\nmigrants who were brought to the new country at a very young\nage. After all, because they had no choice in their migration, they\nhave no culpability which needs to erode over time. Critics have room\nto resist even this case, however, because the crucial issue is\nentitlement, not culpability. Suppose that I pass\nthe Mona Lisa on to my son, Jackson (who has no idea that I stole it),\nand that he becomes incredibly attached to it over the course of\nseveral years. Despite the twin facts that (1) Jackson is in no way\nculpable for possessing the Mona Lisa and (2) he has gradually become\nvery attached to it, he does not seem entitled to keep the\npainting. And if we think the authorities would violate none of\nJackson\u2019s rights if they took the Mona Lisa from him and returned it\nto the Louvre, then why think that the authorities would violate the\nrights of an irregular migrant who at a young age had settled without\nauthorization in a foreign country with her parents? Just as Jackson\nshould not be punished for his possession of the painting, the child\nshould clearly not be punished for having entered a foreign country\nwithout authorization. But Jackson\u2019s right against being punished is\ndistinct from his right to retain the Mona Lisa, and the child\u2019s right\nnot to be punished for her family\u2019s migration is distinct from her\nright to remain in the new country. These objections do not show that\nirregular migrants do not gradually acquire a right to stay, but they\ndo suggest that advocates of this position who also believe in the\nstate\u2019s right to control immigration must do more than merely point to\nthe psychological costs to those who might be deported.\n3.5 Selection Criteria\n\n\nFinally, one of the most complex and controversial issues within the\nliterature on the morality of immigration is what criteria a state may\npermissibly employ to distinguish among applicants for admission.\nCountries might use either a lottery or a first-come, first-admitted\nwaitlist, but they might also screen the applicants and give preference\nto those whose language, culture and/or skill sets make them most\nlikely to assimilate in the host state\u2019s economy and political\nculture. But what if a country\u2019s immigration policies\ndifferentiate among applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion or\ncountry of origin? What if a country flatly refused to even\nconsider applications for immigration from Asians or Africans, for\ninstance?\n\n\nAs with so many issues in this area, Walzer\u2019s (1983) treatment\nof this question is seminal. In this case, though, many have\nrecoiled at his conclusions. To see why, consider his take on\n\u201cWhite Australia,\u201d Australia\u2019s erstwhile practice of\nrecruiting immigration from England while explicitly prohibiting\nimmigration from non-European countries. Walzer writes,\n\u201cAssuming, then, that there actually is superfluous land, the\nclaim of necessity would force a political community like that of White\nAustralia to confront a radical choice. Its members could yield\nland for the sake of homogeneity, or they could give up homogeneity\n(agree to the creation of a multiracial society) for the sake of the\nland. And those would be their only two choices. White\nAustralia could survive only as Little Australia.\u201d (Walzer 1983:\n47) Walzer may well be right that Australia had a duty to share\nits vast land with those who needed it, but it is striking that he had\nno principled objection aimed specifically at Australia\u2019s\nracism. If Australia did not have so much territory, then Walzer\napparently would not object to their excluding immigrants on the basis\nof their race or ethnicity.\n\n\nA number of critics agree that Walzer\u2019s analysis is misguided,\nbut there has been no consensus as to precisely where and why it goes\noff the tracks. Consider, for instance, the conflicting accounts\noffered by David Miller, Joseph Carens and Michael Blake.\nMiller\u2019s take is interesting, because he accepts Walzer\u2019s\narguments and conclusion that political communities enjoy a general\nright to design and enforce their own immigration policies.\nUnlike Walzer, though, Miller stops short of concluding that states can\nexclude potential immigrants on whatever grounds they like. As he\nputs it,\nI have tried to hold a balance between the interest that\nmigrants have in entering the country they want to live in, and the\ninterest that political communities have in determining their\nown character. Although the first of these interests is not strong\nenough to justify a right of migration, it is still substantial, and\nso the immigrants who are refused entry are owed an explanation. To be\ntold that they belong to the wrong race, or sex (or have the wrong\ncolor) is insulting, given that these features do not connect to\nanything of real significance to the society they want to join. Even\ntennis clubs are not entitled to discriminate among applicants on\ngrounds such as these. (Miller 2014: 373\u2013374)\nMiller\u2019s analysis will be attractive to many, but some may worry\nthat it is too quick. What would we say about a white woman who\nrefused to even consider marrying someone outside of her race, for\ninstance? We might well condemn her racism as deplorable, and we\nshould not be the least bit surprised if non-whites were sorely\noffended by her attitudes, but presumably we would stop short of\nsaying that she had a duty to marry a black person. And if a white\nperson is within her rights to refuse to marry anyone who is not\nwhite, then why is a predominantly white political community not\nequally entitled to reject potential immigrants on the basis of their\nrace?\n\n\nJoseph Carens offers an answer to this question by invoking the\nstandard distinction between public and private spheres. He\nwrites, \u201cThere is a deep tension between the right of freedom of\nassociation and the right to equal treatment. One way to address\nthis tension is to say that in the private sphere freedom of\nassociation prevails and in the public sphere equal treatment\ndoes. You can pick your friends on the basis of whatever criteria\nyou wish, but in selecting people for offices you must treat all\ncandidates fairly\u2026.So, the fact that private clubs may admit or\nexclude whomever they choose says nothing about the appropriate\nadmission standards for states. When the state acts it must treat\nindividuals equally.\u201d (Carens 1987: 267\u20138) This answer is\npromising, but even if one is generally sympathetic to the\npublic/private distinction, it is not obvious that it applies to\nadmissions into a country in the same way that it applies to\ndecisions regarding those already within this state.\nThis is because, many presume that in order to be legitimate, states\nmust treat all of their constituents as free and equal, and one way to\npursue this freedom and equality is to ensure that individuals are not\nexcluded from various spheres of power and prestige on the basis of\ntheir membership in historically disadvantaged groups. But\nbecause states need not ensure that their constituents are free and\nequal to all outsiders, it does not have the same reason to protect\nagainst foreigners being excluded on the basis of characteristics that\nwould rightly be ruled out if used by public groups within the\nstate.\n\n\nFinally, Michael Blake (2003) has offered an account which promises\nto avoid all of these pitfalls. His view is striking because it\nexplains the impermissibility of excluding outsiders on the basis of\nracist criteria in terms of how it mistreats insiders. If\nAustralia refuses to allow Asians to enter the country, for instance,\nthen this is an affront to all Asian Australians who are thereby\ntreated as second class citizens. As he says, \u201cTo identify\nthe purpose of the state with the preservation of a cultural group is\ninevitably to draw an invidious distinction against those citizens who\ndo not happen to belong to that community. In all cases in which\nthere are national or ethnic minorities\u2014which is to say, the vast\nmajority of actual cases\u2014to restrict immigration for national or\nethnic reasons is to make some citizens politically inferior to\nothers\u2026. Seeking to eliminate the presence of a given group from\nyour society by selective immigration is insulting to the members of that group\nalready present.\u201d (Blake 2003: 232\u20133) Thus, Blake is able\nto explain what is objectionable about racist selection criteria by\ninvoking the requirement that states treat all of their own\nconstituents as free and equal, since these criteria clearly treat\nthose insiders in the dispreferred group as inferior and\nsubordinate.\n\n\nBlake\u2019s account has much to offer, but it has at least one\nmajor drawback: it appears unable to explain the impermissibility of a\nracially or culturally homogenous political community excluding\npotential immigrants on the basis of their race or culture. If\nAustralia had no Asian citizens, for instance, then there would be no\ninsiders who would be wronged by a policy excluding Asian immigrants,\nand thus Blake\u2019s argument would provide us with no grounds to\ncriticize it.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, A., 2008, \u201cDemocratic Theory and Border Coercion:\nNo Right to Unilaterally Control Your Own\nBorders,\u201d <em>Political Theory</em>, 36: 37\u201365.", "Banting, K. and Kymlicka, W.
