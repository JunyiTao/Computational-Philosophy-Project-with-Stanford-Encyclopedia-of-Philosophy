    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Reasoning, Bounded Agency, and Player Types\n3.8 Reasoning, Bounded Agency, and Player Types\n\nBesides variations in preferences and beliefs, a third crucial aspect\nof players is their styles of information processing, decision making,\nand reasoning. Real cognitive agents are bounded in their information\nprocessing, as both their memory and reasoning capacities are limited.\nIn particular, players may not be able to represent the entire game\nthey are in, nor reason until the end of the game. This phenomenon of\nshort sight has been studied in Grossi\nand Turrini (2012) and Turrini\n(2016). Moreover, in real-life iterated social interaction,\npayoffs are generated along the game, and may not be clear beforehand,\n(Axelrod & Hamilton 1981). In such\ncontexts, the best strategy in terms of short-term payoffs need not be\noptimal in the long run, but bounded agents may miss this longer\nhorizon, (Klein, Marx, & Scheller\n2021).\n\nLogical literature on bounded agency is too broad to be surveyed here.\nFor a few research lines relevant to games, see Fagin\nand Halpern (1987) and Heifetz, Meier, and\nSchipper (2006) on epistemic logics with awareness, Artemov\n(2008) on\n justification logics,\n van Benthem and Pacuit (2011) on\nevidence logics, and Hansson (1998) and Lorini\n(2018) on doxastic logics with computationally tractable belief\nbases.\n\nIn the game theoretic literature, bounded agents have often been\nrepresented as finite state machines (Gutierrez,\nHarrenstein, & Wooldridge 2015;\nBinmore & Samuelson 1992). Limitations on reasoning\ncapacities or memory size then translate into bounds on the machine\nsize. The resulting hierarchy allows for a fine grained analysis of\ninformation processing, reasoning, and thus bounded players of\ndifferent types. This perspective fits well with the logical study of\nagency in computer science, (Gr\u00e4del,\nThomas, & Wilke 2002; Wooldridge 2009).\n\nIn an integrated perspective, preferences, beliefs and reasoning\nstyles can all be subsumed under the game-theoretic notion of a\nplayer type. For reasoning about the future course of a game,\nplayers will hence often entertain beliefs about each others\u2019\ntypes. A simple example is Backward Induction, where players assume\nall opponents fully rational throughout. In more complex settings,\nindividual actors may attempt to rationalize various moves observed\nand derive predictions about their opponents\u2019 future behavior by\ntaking a broader range of options into account. Such players may start\nby assuming the counter-player to be a simple machine, and only move\nup to more complex views when required by evidence. In particular,\nthere is no reason to assume uniformity of players or views. Within a\ngiven scenario, a diversity of player types might be present (Liu\n2009; Liu & Wang 2013; Paul & Ramanujam\n2011; Ghosh & Verbrugge 2018; Bergwerff et al. 2014). For\nsome game-theoretic proposals concerning most frequently occurring\nplayer types, see Camerer (2003).\n\n",
