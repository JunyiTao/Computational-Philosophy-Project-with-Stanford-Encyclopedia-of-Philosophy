    "main_text": "The Development of Buddhism in Korea || The Historical Development of Korean Buddhism\n2.2 The Historical Development of Korean Buddhism\n\nOfficially the origin of Buddhism in Korea is traced back to the fourth century in the early Three Kingdoms Period when it was transmitted to Korea by a monk from Former Qin dynasty in China. However, it is W\u014fnhyo \u5143\u66c9 (617\u2013680) of Silla Kingdom (traditionally dated 57 BCE\u2013935 CE), who is regarded as the first prominent and most seminal Buddhist thinker in the Korean Buddhist tradition. Widely known for his synoptic vision, he holds that the most fundamental Buddhist doctrines are to be understood from the logic of interfusion (w\u014fnyung \u5713\u878d), enabling him to embrace and harmonize different strands of Buddhism without forsaking what is unique to each of them.\n\nWhen Buddhism first arrived in Korea, it was transmitted from China as part of a whole cultural package together with all its diverse Sutras. Ancient Koreans were genuinely puzzled by the sheer diversity of the family of doctrines under the common rubric \u201cBuddhism\u201d and the seeming contradictions among them. While most of his East Asian contemporaries subscribed to doctrinal classification (p\u2019angyo, C. panjiao \u5224\u654e), W\u014fnhyo resorted to \u201charmonization of disputes\u201d (hwajaeng \u548c\u8acd), which consists in taking the differing positions of various schools as expressing partial views of the whole reality, seen from their respective perspectives. In this way, different views can be understood better from their own perspectives and contributed to the body of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist system seen as an integrated whole. With this approach, W\u014fnhyo made it clear that they are all connected, self-consistent parts of the one integrated whole. The breadth of his thought embraced not only Buddhism but the whole spectrum of Tang-era East Asian philosophy, referencing not only major Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures, but those outside Buddhism, such as the Daoists Laozi and Zhuangzi, as well.\n\nCentral to W\u014fnhyo\u2019s thought is the concept of \u201cOne Mind\u201d (ilsim \u4e00\u5fc3) with its metaphysical and soteriological implications. One Mind is identified not only with the minds of all sentient beings, but also with the fundamental ground from which those minds manifest. While appearing externally as impure and ephemeral, this One Mind is posited as intrinsically pure and unchanging. In this way, the One Mind forms the metaphysical ground of W\u014fnhyo\u2019s Buddhist systems and the explication of the various doctrines. The One Mind, however, is not univocal but has two aspects (\u201cgates\u201d), which are different from each other yet complimentary to each other as well. First, the One Mind has an absolute, ultimate aspect, the aspect of true thusness. The absolute aspect of the One Mind is the true reality in and of itself but when it is immanent in the conditioned, it is called \u201ctath\u0101gatagarbha\u201d. The latter, as tainted thusness, is the absolute mind in the conditioned. This tath\u0101gatagarbha can be active in that it can help the minds of sentient beings attain enlightenment. It can also be passive in that it can be concealed by the defilements. In the One Mind, there is also a conventional, \u201cproduction-and-extinction\u201d aspect. It is thus in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the realm of existence that is subject to continual birth and death. This conventional aspect of the One Mind leads to the \u0101l\u0101yavij\u00f1\u0101na (or storehouse consciousness, see below), which serves to store the tainted seeds and proclivities produced by past actions. In this respect, the storehouse consciousness expresses the defiled mind. But the same consciousness can be purified and thus unified with the tath\u0101gatagarbha, which lays bare the untainted original enlightenment (pongak \u672c\u89ba) in each of us (S. Lee 2019). The pure part of the \u0101l\u0101yavij\u00f1\u0101na then is not really different from the tath\u0101gatagarbha, W\u014fnhyo suggests. All in all, our ordinary mind is simultaneously deluded and yet enlightened (W\u014fnhyo, Commentary on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith, HPC 01.0701b24-c05). Sentient beings could be originally enlightened and yet still have to progress through a temporal process of acquiring (or temporal) enlightenment (Buswell, 2007: Part I: Study, 6).\n\nIt is because of the One Mind that the prospect of enlightenment is something innate to the mind itself and inherently accessible to all living creatures. Since this prospect is ubiquitous, even the common people can obtain enlightenment by way of purifying their mind. In the East Asian Classic The Awakening of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Faith (\u5927\u4e58\u8d77\u4fe1\u8ad6) it is called \u201cthe original enlightenment (pongak)\u201d. Indeed, for W\u014fnhyo, the whole universe in and of itself, being an expression of such an enlightenment, is in the continual process of self-realization (Rhi 1971). This true reality, however, is not separated from the common, banal mind. As a matter of fact, the common mind has a seed by which it can reach the ultimate. The ultimate reality is eo ipso the ultimate mind. So, even though the true reality is not literally in our ordinary mind, we can reach for it. This developing state of mind, in which enlightenment is partially and gradually exemplified, W\u014fnhyo calls \u201cacquired (or actualized) enlightenment (sigak \u59cb\u89ba)\u201d. It is an enlightenment in its actual, temporal realization in the ordinary realm. As a seed becomes a tree, the mind is on the way to the final end, the fruit, of the original enlightenment. Since the enlightenment is indeed originally deposited in the mind as Tath\u0101gatagarbha, when the seed is discovered, the whole reality is also completely revealed in its totality. At the very moment of enlightenment, one realizes that the acquired enlightenment is in fact the same as the original enlightenment that has been deposited in the mind all along. \n\nW\u014fnhyo\u2019s various writings show the first major systematic inquiry into the fundamental metaphysical reality of the world on the Korean peninsula. His work Treatise on the Ten Ways of Resolving Controversies (Simmun hwajaeng non \u5341\u9580\u548c\u8acd\u8ad6 in Muller and Ngyyen 2012) not only influenced Fazang and Cheng-gwan among the Chinese masters but also Gy\u014dnen, Zensh\u016b, and Joto in Japan.\n\n\u016cisang \u7fa9\u6e58 (625\u2013702), a younger contemporary of W\u014fnhyo and also from Silla, is the founder of Korean Hwa\u014fm (C. Huayan) school. His view is presented in his Ocean Seal Diagram (haeindo \u6d77\u5370\u5716) where Hwa\u014fm philosophy\u2019s vision of reality and an all-embracing worldview is most perspicuously symbolized. Differences and distinctions are overcome in this work and shown to be integral parts of a transcendent whole. The nature and characteristics of this transcendent and cohesive vision of reality, however, were not easy for all Buddhists to understand. What we call \u201cthe universe\u201d was simultaneously empty of duality and self-nature and yet still able to comprehensively integrate all things. Although proponents of the Hwa\u014fm school employ several terms to describe aspects of this reality, the most general and all-inclusive descriptive term is \u201cperfect interfusion\u201d (w\u014fnyung). \n\nHow does \u016cisang communicate his understanding of the concept of \u201cperfect interfusion\u201d in his writings? Although the following is not exhaustive, he explicates this idea by crafting a powerful and instructive visual image, and articulated an all-embracing concept of the universal dharma understanding of \u201cperfect interfusion\u201d. Originally titled, Diagram of the Dharmadh\u0101tu of the One Vehicle of Hwa\u014fm (Hwa\u014fm ils\u016dng p\u014fpgyedo \u83ef\u56b4\u4e00\u4e58\u6cd5\u754c\u5716), the Ocean Seal Diagram (S\u0101garamudr\u0101 Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala), is arranged like a wavelike form, which symbolizes the Dharma Realm together with the Hwa\u014fm teaching of the \u201csix marks\u201d (yuksang): \nuniversality mark (ch\u2019ongsang \u7e3d\u76f8) and particularity mark (py\u014flgsang \u5225\u76f8); \nsameness (identity) mark (tongsang \u540c\u76f8) and \ndifference mark (yisang \u7570\u76f8); \nformation (integration) mark (s\u014fngsang \u6210\u76f8) and disintegration mark (kwoesang \u58de\u76f8).\n In other words, awakening to the reality of one\u2019s existence is explained here through one\u2019s awakening to the simultaneity of contrasting marks. One is thus awakened to the simultaneous existence of the universal in the particular, or the noumenon in the phenomenon. Thus, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and nirv\u0101\u1e47a are always harmonized together. Particular Phenomena (sa \u4e8b) and universal Principle (i \u7406) are completely merged without distinction (\u016cisang Hwa\u014fm ils\u016dng p\u014fpgye to; see also P. Lee 1993: 161\u20133).\n\n\nOcean Seal Diagram  S\u0101garamudr\u0101 Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala\n\nIndeed, in this Ocean Seal Diagram, the ontological doctrine of \u201cdependent co-arising of the Dharma-Realm\u201d, central to the Hwa\u014fm School, is depicted as if engraved on a rectangular seal (stamp), in the form of a poem in 30 stanzas with seven characters on each line (210 characters in sum), in a continuous maze-like\nline with 51 angles, suggesting that all phenomena, since they do not attach to self-nature but follow the conditions, are interconnected and unified in the dharma-nature; the fact that this line ends at the same place where it began (the Sino-Korean character \u201c\u6cd5 (Dharma)\u201d in the middle) illustrates the cardinal Hwa\u014fm doctrine of interpenetration as well as the central Buddhist doctrine of the Middle Way. The whole and parts of the diagram interpenetrate harmoniously without any obstructions. Hence, the diagram serves as a comprehensive summary of all the teachings found in the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra (Flower Garland Sutra).\n\nThe next major trend of thought of Korean Buddhism, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (Consciousness-Only) Buddhism, would not have been possible without the Chinese master Xuanzang (602\u2013664). W\u014fnch\u016dk \u5713\u6e2c (613\u2013696), originally from Silla but who was active and died in Tang China, was a member of his inner circle but their relation might have eroded as time passed. But in view of the fact that W\u014fnch\u016dk thoroughly subscribed to Xuanzang\u2019s translated Cheng weishi lun (\u6210\u552f\u8b58\u8ad6), it is hard to see his position as fundamentally in conflict with Xuanzang or for that matter the latter\u2019s Chinese disciple Kuiji (\u7aba\u57fa). The most important contribution on the part of Xuanzang was the introduction of the doctrine of five distinct [spiritual] lineages \n(C. wuzhong xing  \u4e94\u7a2e\u6027, \nS. pa\u00f1cagotra) of sentient beings, which was entailed by his view of \u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na as his new translations amply showed. Unfortunately this doctrine was regarded as contradictory to the tath\u0101gatagarbha theory because virtually everybody assumed that the tath\u0101gatagarbha theory necessarily entails that the Buddha-nature is universally innate in all sentient beings. Given this controversial implication, W\u014fnch\u016dk was determined to reconcile the two seemingly contradictory positions. How did W\u014fnch\u016dk accept both tath\u0101gatagarbha as well as five different lineages including icchantikas, the lineage of beings who are beyond the possibility of salvation and lose forever the capacity to achieve nirv\u0101\u1e47a? First, for him, the Buddha-nature belongs to the level of principle while the five different lineages belong to the level of practice with their own Buddha-nature. This has the consequence that the indeterminate lineages can pursue enlightenment (other than pratyekabuddhas (the self-enlightened), \u015br\u0101vaka (the voice-hearer) and bodhisattvas). But unfortunately this does not apply to the fifth lineages, i.e., icchantikas. Instead, W\u014fnch\u016dk tried to interfuse the Buddha-nature at the level of principle and the Buddha-nature at the practical level, thus giving rise to the resolution that both are right at their own level. The Buddha-nature should be acknowledged at the level of principle, to be sure. And he can accept the view of tath\u0101gatagarbha. But at the level of practice, we have to acknowledge the existential reality of evil and allow the possibility not only of indeterminate lineages but also icchantikas. Icchantikas are incapable of enlightenment outright but still they are viewed as pursuing upgrading their status into the human status or heavenly status if and when they practice five precepts and ten good conducts, etc. Thus W\u014fnch\u016dk could hold that, because of our tath\u0101gatagarbha working for our salvation, we all are able to obtain salvation by way of the distinction between the Buddha-nature in practice and that in principle (S. Lee forthcoming).\n\nW\u014fnch\u016dk\u2019s view thus could proceed coherently without forsaking his allegiance to the doctrine of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, according to which all conditioned existence is dependent on consciousness. Consciousness is the basis of all activities from birth to attaining enlightenment. In addition to the five sensory consciousnesses as well as two conceptual consciousnesses, there is the eighth consciousness, which is called \u201cstorehouse consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na)\u201d. This is the principal part of consciousness which is the basis of the seven other consciousnesses. Everything in the world is composed of dharmas where dharmas are the basic interdependent patterns within the overall nature of reality. Each dharma is a mental-construct with a specific process that consists of a stream of momentary events (W\u014fnch\u016dk Commentary on the Samdhinirmocana-sutra). Later W\u014fnch\u016dk\u2019s Yog\u0101c\u0101ra vision was transmitted to Korea by the way of his students such as Toch\u016dng \u9053\u8b49 (ca. eighth century), and Taehy\u014fn \u5927\u8ce2 (ca. eighth century).\n\nNo discussion of Korean Buddhism, however, would be complete without discussing Chinul \u77e5\u8a25 (1158\u20131210, Dharma name: Pojo), a Buddhist monk of the Kory\u014f dynasty and the founder of S\u014fn (\u79aa C. Chan, J. Zen) Buddhism, which is the leading school of Buddhist thought in Korea.\n\nA scholiast and a meditation master, he dedicated his energies to creating harmony between two conflicting sectarian positions, those who emphasized meditation, on the one hand, and those who were dedicated to textual studies (kyo \u654e) on the other. He started his career as a tireless reformer. This was achieved by way of introducing and regulating meditative practices to the existing sangha that later became the integral part of S\u014fn and, eventually, all of Korean Buddhism. A key innovation of his within S\u014fn was his introduction and elaboration of kong\u2019an (\u516c\u6848 the public case records) or rather the practice of its key component called \u201chwadu (\u8a71\u982d)\u201d (Park 2005).\n\n\u201cHwadu\u201d literally means \u201chead of speech\u201d or \u201cthe limit of speech\u201d. Since speech presupposes the discriminating mode of the mind, the hwadu works as a mechanism of transcending the discriminations of the discursive mind and thought. In \u201cResolving Doubts about Observing the Hwadu,\u201d Chinul suggests that hwadu produces the \u201ccleansing knowledge and vision\u201d (Chinul-CW, 244). He then approvingly gives the quintessential hwadu: \n  \nA monk asked Zhaozhou, \u201cDoes a dog have the Buddha-nature or not?\u201d Zhaozhou replied, \u201cMu! [Nothing \u7121!]\u201d (op. cit., 245).\n  \n It is common sense in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism that all living beings have Buddha-nature. So, why is the monk asking what is an obvious and absurd question, and why is Zhaozhou giving a paradoxical answer? In discussing this hwadu and instructing his students how to work with it, Chinul suggests that Mu is \u201cthe weapon which destroys wrong knowledge and wrong understanding\u201d. Zhaozhou\u2019s \u201cMu\u201d here does not mean an affirmative answer nor a negative one. The student of S\u014fn here then should not consider it in relation to a doctrinal theory\u2014one only needs to \u201cbe concerned about keeping this question before [one] and [one\u2019s] attention always focused\u201d. In this way, when the student of S\u014fn follows the tortuous yet fruitful path of hwadu patiently,\n  \n\n unexpectedly, in an instant, the student activates one moment of realization in regard to the tasteless, elusive hwadu, and the dharmadh\u0101tu of the one mind becomes utterly evident and clear. (Op. cit. 246)\n  \nThe hwadu method then enables the students to realize the true inner nature of the mind\u2014the intrinsic emptiness of Buddhahood\u2014and to enter into the realm of nirv\u0101\u1e47a (H. Kim 2014).\n\nLet us now examine the difference between the S\u014fn tradition and the doctrinal schools in Korean Buddhism, and Chinul\u2019s way of synthesizing them. The S\u014fn school is most distinctively oriented to practice. S\u014fn here primarily refers to the conjoined practice of sam\u0101dhi (concentration) and praj\u00f1\u0101 (wisdom) (Keel 1984). Already in the early work such as Encouragement to Practice and Secrets on Cultivating the Mind, Chinul emphasizes the need to \u201ccultivate concentration and wisdom in tandem\u201d. Concentration means a mental absorption. As the student of Buddhism turns his or her attention away from the world of sensible things and brings it to bear on what is internal, he or she engages in meditation to obtain unmovable peace within himself or herself. In the process, the student exercises pure mental focus with a resulting state of calmness. This is concentration. Furthermore, as this concentration naturally creates the energy of mental penetration, the mind is now directed to make inquiries into the nature of the world and that of the self, thereby generating insight into reality. This is wisdom\u2014it is transcendental understanding of the nature of the world and the self in it, with a resulting state of alertness. The S\u014fn then combines the merits of both concentration and wisdom that eventually leads to the discovery of the source of all sentient beings, indeed, the whole world.\n\nSo, what is the nature of the ultimate reality of the world? Chinul typically calls the unconditioned reality of the world \u201cTrue Mind (chinsim \u771e\u5fc3)\u201d. This is the same as Buddha-nature. \u201cTrue\u201d here means the absolute lack of any illusion, or in his words, \u201cto leave behind the false\u201d. \u201cMind\u201d means the source of reality that is the numinous mirror. In particular, it is not used as the mental faculty of an individual human being. As such, the True Mind is not properly describable. It can only be symbolized. For example, it is symbolized by dharmadh\u0101tu in the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra. Following the Sutra, Chinul holds that the phenomena of the world are formed because of the works of the mind. There is no separate world outside the mind. Chinul thus speaks of mind sive Buddha. The mind makes the Buddhas.\n\nIs our ordinary mind then also the True Mind? No, our daily minds\u2014discrete, empirical, limited, individual, separate minds\u2014are mere phenomena, appearances, manifestations of the True Mind. For there is no cause or effect for the True Mind. It is neither in space nor in time. It has no beginning and end. Again inspired by the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra, Chinul claims that all phenomena are mutually interdependent and interpenetrating. For him, then, in the mirror of one\u2019s mind, there is \n  \n\n the perfectly bright and self-reliant functions of the dharmadh\u0101tu which remain, including the unimpeded interpenetration of all phenomena ..., are never separate from the pure enlightened nature (the dharmadh\u0101tu). (Chinul-CW \u201cComplete and Sudden Attainment of Buddhahood,\u201d 216\u2013217)\n\nHow, then, do we realize this true nature of the mind within the confines of our finite embodied conditions? In the Secrets of Cultivating the Mind, Chinul suggests that we start with a sudden enlightenment (initial awakening) by way of the method of the hwadu. This leads to the vision that \u201cI am a Buddha\u201d (142). But what should we then do from that point on? In his mature period, Chinul suggests that a sudden enlightenment should be followed by gradual cultivation (144). The awakening to the true nature of the mind is sudden and immediate. Despite our awakening to true reality by way of the successful execution of the hwadu method, we have to control old habits and cultivate various character traits gradually. This is the gradual process of cultivation. Finally, we have to understand and conduct in perfect unison (Keel 1984).\n\nIn sum, the understanding of the nondual nature of the mind is obtained suddenly but the complete eradication of practical evils is achieved only gradually. Chinul also developed his scheme of Sudden Enlightenment to our true nature under the guise of emptiness followed by a Gradual Cultivation. Chinul, as a good Korean Buddhist monk, thus shows a nice syncretistic attitude toward the controversy known as Tonj\u014fm (\u9813\u6f38) debate, suggesting a moderate position of tono ch\u014fmsu \u9813\u609f\u6f38\u4fee (gradualism, i.e., sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation) (Chinul-CW, \u201cSecrets on Cultivating the Mind\u201d, 143) in contrast to, e.g., tono tonsu \u9813\u609f\u9813\u4fee (subitism, i.e., sudden enlightenment followed by sudden cultivation) (Peter H. Lee 1993, Vol. I, 418\u2013419).\n",
