    "main_text": "Can contractualism protect animals?\n13. Can contractualism protect future people?\n\nAnother problem facing any social contract theory concerns our\nobligations to future people. It is hard to see how we can have any\nobligations to such people, as they cannot be parties to our contract.\nThis is principally because of the absence of any possibility of\nmutually advantageous interaction between distant\ngenerations. The quality of life of future generations depends to a\nvery large extent on the decisions of the present generation. By\ncontrast, our quality of life is not affected at all by their\ndecisions. We can do a great deal to (or for) posterity but posterity\ncannot do anything to (or for) us. This power imbalance is often\ncharacterised in terms of the absence of Hume\u2019s\n\u201ccircumstances of justice\u201d. (The phrase is borrowed from\nRawls 1971, pp. 126\u2013130.)\n\nFor contractarians, for whom morality is an agreement for\nmutual advantage, it follows that we have no obligations to future\npeople with whom we cannot interact. A similar problem arises for\nthose like Rawls who seek to base the social contract on some\nmodification of self-interested behaviour\u2014such as self-interest\nbehind the veil of ignorance.\n\nContractualism, by contrast, easily avoids this particular problem, as\nit begins by assuming that moral agents are motivated by a desire to\njustify themselves to others. There is no reason why those others must\nbe currently existing people. When deciding how to act, I can ask\nmyself whether future people who are affected by my actions might\nreasonably reject a principle permitting those actions. For instance,\nif I want to construct a power plant that will leak radiation in the\nfuture, it makes perfect sense to ask whether those who will suffer as\na result might reasonably object to my behaviour. Because it works\nwith the possibility of reasonable rejection\u2014rather than actual\nbargaining\u2014contractualism can accommodate obligations to future\npeople. This is a significant advantage over other social contract\ntheories.\n\nHowever, there is a second problem regarding future people\u2014one\nthat does seem to apply to contractualism. This problem owes its\nprominence in recent philosophical debate to the work of Derek Parfit,\nto whom we owe the following example (Parfit 1984, pp.\n351\u2013379):\n\nThe Summer or Winter Child. Mary is deciding when to have a\nchild. She could have one in summer or in winter. Mary suffers from a\nrare condition which means that, if she has her child in winter, it\nwill suffer serious ailments which will reduce the quality of its\nlife. However, a child born in winter would still have a life worth\nliving, and, if Mary decides to have a child in summer, then an\naltogether different child will be born. It is mildly inconvenient for\nMary to have a child in summer. (Perhaps she doesn\u2019t fancy being\nheavily pregnant during hot weather.) Therefore, she opts for a winter\nbirth.\n\n\nMary\u2019s behaviour seems morally wrong. Utilitarians have a simple\naccount of why Mary\u2019s behaviour is wrong, as she brings about\nless human happiness than she could have done. Yet it seems that\ncontractualism cannot capture this intuition. Consider a principle\npermitting Mary\u2019s behaviour. If Mary\u2019s behaviour is wrong,\nthen this principle must be one that someone can reasonably reject.\nBut who? Not the Winter Child\u2014because he would otherwise never\nhave existed at all. And not the Summer Child\u2014because he\ndoesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPerhaps the most promising contractualist defence lies, once again, in\nthe possibility that my grounds for rejecting a principle are not\nnecessarily confined to its direct impact on my well-being. We might\nseparate two moves the contractualist can make here. They might argue\n(1) that the grounds for rejecting a principle need not be its impact\non my well-being; or (2) that it need not be its impact on\nmy well-being. Intuitively, what is objectionable about\nMary\u2019s behaviour is not anything to do with well-being, or with\nthe identity of future individuals. What is wrong is rather that Mary\nfails to show adequate respect for \u2018her future\nchild\u2019\u2014whoever that child may turn out to be. Even though\nthere is no particular individual who can be said to have been harmed,\nthere is still legitimate ground for a complaint that a principle\npermitting Mary\u2019s behaviour shows inadequate respect to future\npeople. The challenge for the Contractualist is to translate this\ncomplaint into one that can be made on behalf of the Winter Child.\n(For one recent attempt at such a translation, see Kumar 2003a, 2009.\nFor a critique, see Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 235)\n\nIn chapter 22 of On What Matters, Parfit argues that the\nimpersonalist restriction\u2014which rules out appeals to the\nimpersonal goodness or badness of outcomes\u2014leaves any form of\ncontractualism that incorporates the individualist restriction unable\nto respond to the non-identity problem.\n\nInstead, Parfit argues that contractualists should permit both\npersonal and impartial reasons as grounds for\nreasonable rejection. Impartial reasons, here, are grounded\nin the moral claims or the well-being of individuals. \u201cWe have\nsuch impartial reasons to care about the well-being of every\nindividual or person\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 238). The\ncrucial feature of impartial reasons is that they are not narrowly\nperson-affecting. In a different people choice, we have an impartial\nreason to maximise the well-being of future people\u2014even though\ndifferent possible futures include different groups of possible\npeople. \u201cSince [because of the non-identity problem] we cannot\nappeal to the personal reasons that are had by people who\nnever exist, we should appeal to the impartial\nreasons that are had by people who do exist\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 240).\n\nAs with the individualist restriction, we might wonder whether the\nadmission of impartial reasons effectively abandons the spirit of\ncontractualism. If every present person has the same impartial\nreasons, and if those reasons cannot outweigh any individual\u2019s\npersonal reasons, then the resulting more impartial formulation of\ncontractualism will converge with rule consequentialism. But does this\nresult tell us anything interesting about Scanlon\u2019s\ncontractualism? More generally, will the resulting theory retain the\ndistinctive features of contractualism that appeal to those who are\nunsatisfied with familiar alternatives such as Kantian ethics or rule\nconsequentialism?\n\nDebates about future people also connect to other recent controversies\nwithin contractualism, especially the literature on risk. The divide\nbetween ex post and ex ante justification is especially significant in\nnon-identity cases, where ex post justification can be offered to\nparticular individuals while ex ante justification can only deal with\nperson types. Should contractualists give their person-affecting\nprinciples an ex post or ex ante interpretation? (Weinberg 2003 and\n2015 defends an ex post interpretation, albeit within a Rawlsian\nframework rather than a Scanlonian one; while Parfit 2017 clearly sets\nout the ex ante alternative.)\n\nAnother emerging debate is whether contractualism can deliver\nplausible verdicts in cases involving risks of human extinction. The\nprima facie problem for contractualism here is that, because the\noutcome where we fail to avoid imminent extinction contains no future\npeople at all, there is no (particular or representative) future\nperson who has the standing to reasonably reject principles\ninstructing present people to ignore extinction risks and focus\nentirely on meeting present needs.
