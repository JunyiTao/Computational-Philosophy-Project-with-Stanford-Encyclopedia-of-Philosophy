    "main_text": "\n\nAn infinite regress is a series of appropriately related elements with\na first member but no last member, where each element leads to or\ngenerates the next in some\n sense.[1]\n An infinite regress argument is an argument that makes appeal to an\ninfinite regress. Usually such arguments take the form of objections\nto a theory, with the fact that the theory implies an infinite regress\nbeing taken to be objectionable.\n\nThere are two ways in which a theory\u2019s resulting in an infinite\nregress can form an objection to that theory. The regress might reveal\na bad feature of the theory\u2014a feature that is not the regress\nitself, that we have independent reason to think is a reason to reject\nthe theory. Or the fact that the theory results in the infinite\nregress might itself be taken to be a reason to reject the theory. The\nformer cases are the easier ones, since in those cases we do not have\nto make a judgment as to whether the regress itself is objectionable,\nwe only need to ask about the feature of the theory that the regress\nreveals. We will look at cases like this first, before turning to\ncases where the regress itself might be seen as a reason to reject a\ntheory.\n\nMany, many infinite regress arguments have been given throughout the\nhistory of philosophy, and we will not attempt here to survey even the\nmost important of them. Rather, the aim will be to shed light on the\nkinds of regress argument that may be encountered, and the different\nconsiderations that arise in different cases. As we proceed, however,\nwe will see some particularly famous regress arguments as examples.\n(Rescher 2010 and Wieland 2014 survey some historical\n regresses.)[2]\n",
