    "main_text": "Philosophical Hermeneutics || The Positivity of \u2018Prejudice\u2019\n3.1 The Positivity of \u2018Prejudice\u2019\n\nOne might respond to Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on our prior hermeneutic\ninvolvement, whether in the experience of art or elsewhere, that such\ninvolvement cannot but remain subjective simply on the grounds that it\nis always determined by our particular dispositions to experience\nthings in certain ways rather than others\u2014our involvement, one\nmight say, is thus always based on subjective prejudice. Such\nan objection can be seen as a simple reiteration of the basic tendency\ntowards subjectivism that Gadamer rejects, but Gadamer also takes\nissue directly with this view of prejudice and the negative\nconnotations often associated with the notion, arguing that, rather\nthan closing us off, our prejudices are themselves what open us up to\nwhat is to be understood. In this way Gadamer can be seen as\nattempting to retrieve a positive conception of prejudice (German\nVorurteil) that goes back to the meaning of the term as\nliterally a pre-judgment (from the Latin\nprae-judicium) that was lost during the Renaissance. In\nTruth and Method, Gadamer redeploys the notion of our prior\nhermeneutical situatedness as it is worked out in more particular\nfashion in Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time (first published\nin 1927) in terms of the \u2018fore-structures\u2019 of\nunderstanding, that is, in terms of the anticipatory structures that\nallow what is to be interpreted or understood to be grasped in a\npreliminary fashion. The fact that understanding operates by means of\nsuch anticipatory structures means that understanding always involves\nwhat Gadamer terms the \u2018anticipation of\ncompleteness\u2019\u2014it always involves the revisable\npresupposition that what is to be understood constitutes something\nthat is understandable, that is, something that is constituted as a\ncoherent, and therefore meaningful, whole.\n\nGadamer\u2019s positive conception of prejudice as pre-judgment is\nconnected with several ideas in his approach to hermeneutics. The way\nin which our prejudgments open us up to the matter at issue in such a\nway that those prejudgments are themselves capable of being revised\nexhibits the character of the Gadamerian conception of prejudgment,\nand its role in understanding, as itself constituting a version of the\nhermeneutic circle. The hermeneutical priority Gadamer assigns to\nprejudgment is also tied to Gadamer\u2019s emphasis on the priority\nof the question in the structure of understanding\u2014the latter\nemphasis being something Gadamer takes both from Platonic dialectic\nand also, in Truth and Method, from the work of R. G.\nCollingwood. Moreover, the indispensable role of prejudgment in\nunderstanding connects directly with Gadamer\u2019s rethinking of the\ntraditional concept of hermeneutics as necessarily involving, not\nmerely explication, but also application. In this respect,\nall interpretation, even of the past, is necessarily\n\u2018prejudgmental\u2019 in the sense that it is always oriented to\npresent concerns and interests, and it is those present concerns and\ninterests that allow us to enter into the dialogue with the matter at\nissue. Here, of course, there is a further connection with the\nAristotelian emphasis on the practical\u2014not only is understanding\na matter of the application of something like \u2018practical\nwisdom\u2019, but it is also always determined by the practical\ncontext out of which it arises.\n\nThe prejudicial character of understanding means that, whenever we\nunderstand, we are necessarily involved in a dialogue that encompasses\nboth our own self-understanding and our understanding of the matter at\nissue (and there is, it should be added, an essential alterity that\nobtains even in those cases where our engagement is primarily\ntextual). In the dialogue of understanding our prejudices come to the\nfore, both inasmuch as they play a crucial role in opening up what is\nto be understood, and inasmuch as they themselves become evident in\nthat process. As our prejudices thereby become apparent to us, so they\ncan also become the focus of questioning in their own turn. While\nGadamer has claimed that \u2018temporal distance\u2019 can play a\nuseful role in enabling us better to identify those prejudices that\nexercise a problematic influence on understanding (Gadamer\nacknowledges that prejudices can sometimes distort\u2014the point is\nthat they do not always do so), it seems better to see the dialogical\ninterplay that occurs in the process of understanding itself as the\nmeans by which such problematic elements are identified and worked\nthrough. One consequence of Gadamer\u2019s rehabilitation of\nprejudice is a positive evaluation of the role of authority and\ntradition as legitimate sources of knowledge, and this has often been\nseen, most famously by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, as indicative of\nGadamer\u2019s ideological conservatism\u2014Gadamer himself viewed\nit as merely providing a proper corrective to the over-reaction\nagainst these ideas that occurred with the Enlightenment.\n",
