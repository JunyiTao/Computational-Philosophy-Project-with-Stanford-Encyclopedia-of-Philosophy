    "main_text": "Imagination in Cognitive Architecture || Imagination and Belief\n2.1 Imagination and Belief\n\nTo believe is to take something to be the case or regard it\nas true (see the entry on\n belief).\n When one says something like \u201cthe liar believes that his pants\nare on fire\u201d, one attributes to the subject (the liar) an\nattitude (belief) towards a proposition (his pants are on fire).\nLikewise, when one says something like \u201cthe liar imagines that\nhis pants are on fire\u201d, one attributes to the subject (the liar)\nan attitude (imagination) towards a proposition (his pants are on\nfire). The similarities and differences between the belief attribution\nand the imagination attribution point to similarities and differences\nbetween imagining and believing. \n\nImagining and believing are both cognitive attitudes that are\nrepresentational. They take on the same kind of content:\nrepresentations that stand in inferential relationship with one\nanother. On the single code hypothesis, it is the sameness of\nthe representational format that grounds functional similarities\nbetween imagining and believing (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003;\nNichols 2004a). As for their differences, there are two main options\nfor distinguishing imagining and believing (Sinhababu 2016).\n\nThe first option characterizes their difference in normative terms.\nWhile belief aims at truth, imagination does not (Humberstone\n1992; Shah & Velleman 2005). If the liar did not regard it as true\nthat his pants are on fire, then it seems that he cannot really\nbelieve that his pants are on fire. By contrast, even if the liar did\nnot regard it as true that his pants are on fire, he can still imagine\nthat his pants are on fire. While the norm of truth is constitutive of\nthe attitude of belief, it is not constitutive of the attitude of\nimagination. In dissent, Neil Sinhababu (2013) argues that the norm of\ntruth is neither sufficient nor necessary for distinguishing imagining\nand believing.\n\nThe second option characterizes their difference in functional terms.\nOne purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to actions. If the liar truly\nbelieves that his pants are on fire, he will typically attempt to put\nout the fire by, say, pouring water on himself. By contrast, if the\nliar merely imagines that his pants are on fire, he will typically do\nno such thing. While belief outputs to action-generation system,\nimagination does not (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003). David Velleman\n(2000) and Tyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) point to particular\npretense behaviors to challenge this way of distinguishing imagining\nand believing. Velleman argues that a belief-desire explanation of\nchildren\u2019s pretense behaviors makes children \u201cdepressingly\nunchildlike\u201d. Doggett and Egan argue that during immersive\nepisodes, pretense behaviors can be directly motivated by imagination.\nIn response to these challenges, philosophers typically accept that\nimagination can have a guidance or stage-setting role in motivating\nbehaviors, but reject that it directly outputs to action-generation\nsystem (Van Leeuwen 2009; O\u2019Brien 2005; Funkhouser &\nSpaulding 2009; Everson 2007; Kind 2011; Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002).\n\nAnother purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to emotions. If the liar\ntruly believes that his pants are on fire, then he will be genuinely\nafraid of the fire; but not if he merely imagines so. While belief\nevokes genuine emotions toward real entities, imagination does not\n(Walton 1978, 1990, 1997; see also related discussion of the paradox\nof fictional emotions in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n This debate is entangled with the controversy concerning the nature\nof emotions (see the entry on\n emotion).\n In rejecting this purported functional difference, philosophers also\ntypically reject narrow cognitivism about emotions (Nichols 2004a;\nMeskin & Weinberg 2003; Weinberg & Meskin 2005, 2006; Kind\n2011; Spaulding 2015; Carruthers 2003, 2006).\n\nCurrently, the consensus is that there exists some important\ndifference between imagining and believing. Yet, there are two\ndistinct departures from this consensus. On the one hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to novel psychological phenomena in which it\nis unclear whether imagination or belief is at work\u2014such as\ndelusions (Egan 2008a) and immersed pretense (Schellenberg\n2013)\u2014and argued that the best explanation for these phenomena\nsays that imagination and belief exists on a continuum. In responding\nto the argument from immersed pretense, Shen-yi Liao and Tyler Doggett\n(2014) argue that a cognitive architecture that collapses distinctive\nattitudes on the basis of borderline cases is unlikely to be fruitful\nin explaining psychological phenomena. On the other hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to familiar psychological phenomena and\nargued that the best explanation for these phenomena says that\nimagination is ultimately reducible to belief. Peter Langland-Hassan\n(2012, 2014) argues that pretense can be explained with only reference\nto beliefs\u2014specifically, beliefs about counterfactuals. Derek\nMatravers (2014) argues that engagements with fictions can be\nexplained without references to imaginings.\n",
