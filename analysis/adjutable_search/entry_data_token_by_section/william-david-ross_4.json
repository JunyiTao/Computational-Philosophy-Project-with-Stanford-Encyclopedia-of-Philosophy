    "main_text": "Ross\u2019s Distinctive Moral Framework: The Right and the Good || The Right\n4.1 The Right\n\nRoss subscribes to five underivative or foundational duties (Hurka\n2014; McNaughton 1996; Phillips 2019; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b;\nStratton-Lake 2002a, 2011a; cf. Jack 1971):\n\nA duty of fidelity, that is, a duty to keep our promises\n(RG 21; FE 76\u201377; KT 21);\nA duty of reparation, that is, a duty to correct a\nprevious wrong we have done (RG 21; FE 76; KT 21);\nA duty of gratitude, that is, a duty to return services\nto those from whom we have in the past accepted benefits (RG 21; FE\n76; KT 21);\nA duty of beneficence, that is, a duty to maximise\naggregate or general good (RG 25, 27, 30, 39; FE 67, 99, 130, 252,\n257, 271, 313; KT 21); and finally\nA duty of non-maleficence, that is, a duty not to harm or\ninjure others (RG 21\u201322, 26; FE 75, 130n1, 272).\n\n\nRoss\u2019s major innovation involves characterising these as\nprima facie duties rather than absolute or\nexceptionless duties. The notion of a prima facie\nduty may not be easy to grasp. Ross himself admits \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019 is an unfortunate phrase to use to specify what he\nhas in mind, for two reasons (RG 20; FE 84\u201385).\n\nFirst, although he says there exist five basic prima facie\nduties, what he is referring to are not really duties (RG 20;\nFE 84\u201385). Prima facie duties do not state our actual\nobligation or duty proper \u2013 the thing we ultimately ought do\n\u2013 in a particular situation (RG 20). Instead, each duty rests on\na separate and distinct ground and specifies a consideration counting\nin favour of or against an act or what to set ourselves to do, morally\nspeaking.[1] As\nDavid Phillips puts it, \u2018[t]he characteristic of being a prima\nfacie duty is the characteristic of having a certain degree of\nobligatoriness or weight in virtue of being of a single morally\nsignificant kind\u2019 (2019, 23). For example, that an act fails to\nfulfil a promise counts against it being right, and that an act\nproduces the most surplus good counts in favour of it being morally\nright. Considerations of this sort have to be weighed and balanced\nagainst each other in deciding what we ought to do all things\nconsidered or simpliciter.\n\nSecond, using the phrase suggests the duties only appear to be duties\nthat further reflection may reveal to be illusory. This is not\nRoss\u2019s view: the considerations his duties point to are\nobjective facts present in a situation (RG 20; FE 85). If you have\nwronged someone in the past, it is an objective fact of your situation\nthat there is a consideration in favour of you compensating them for\nthe harm.\n\nThere are numerous ways the idea of a prima facie duty might\nbe further clarified. One way, suggested by Ross, is to think of a\nprima facie duty as constituting a tendency to be\nmorally right or wrong (RG 28; FE 86). An act promoting general good\nhas, for example, a tendency to be morally right and to contribute to\ndetermining our actual obligation (Hurka 2014, 72). A second way, also\nsuggested by Ross, is to think of a prima facie duty as\ncomprising a responsibility (FE 85). Repairing one\u2019s past wrongs\nis something for which one has a responsibility, for instance, and\nthis contributes to determining one\u2019s actual obligation or\nresponsibility. A third (controversial) way of explicating the idea is\nto think of a prima facie duty as constituting a moral\nreason for or against an act (Cowan 2017, 825; Olsen 2014, 64\u201365,\n2015: 8; Shaver 2014, 314n24; Stratton-Lake 2002a, xxxiii\u2013xxxviii,\n2011a, 147\u201348, though cf. 2019). If my act will harm or injure another\nperson, I have a moral reason not to do it given the duty of\nnon-maleficence, and this reason contributes to determining my actual\nobligation. A fourth (more controversial still) way of clarifying the\nidea of a prima facie duty is to think of it as constituting\na reason (sans phrase) in favour of or against an act\n(Phillips 2019, 26\u201337; Shaver 2011, 144). Ross himself used the\nlanguage of reasons to explicate the idea of a prima facie\nduty. He says, for example, \u2018the fact that a promise has been\nmade itself constitutes a reason why it should be fulfilled\u2019 (KT\n21). These reasons contribute to determining my actual obligation or\nwhat I have actual reason to do.\n\nThe idea of a prima facie duty or obligation had not been\nfully clarified before Ross, either by defenders of deontological\ntheories (though see Price 1787, 152, 167, 168 and Prichard 2002,\n77\u201383) or their critics (including Moore 1903, 1912; Rashdall 1907,\n1913; and Sidgwick 1907). Ross\u2019s introduction of the notion of a\nprima facie obligation constitutes a major advance in the\ndispute between utilitarians and non-utilitarians. It paved the way\nfor a moderate deontology. Ross\u2019s innovation is crucial to\navoiding cases thought problematic for absolute deontology in which\nobligations conflict and one is unable to avoid doing what is all\nthings considered wrong (FE 83\u201386).\n\nRoss\u2019s five basic principles contribute to explaining other,\nnon-basic moral considerations. The duty not to lie has two sources.\nRoss thinks you ought not lie because, in line with the duty of\nnon-maleficence, to \u2018tell lies is prima facie to do a\npositive injury to another person\u2019 (RG 55) and because, in line\nwith the duty of fidelity, when you enter into a conversation there is\nan implicit promise or understanding \u2018language shall be used to\nconvey the real opinions of . . . speakers\u2019 (RG 54; also 21; FE\n97). The obligation to obey the laws of one\u2019s country is\nexplained by the obligations of gratitude, fidelity and beneficence\n(RG 27). If one has benefitted from the laws of one\u2019s country\none ought to obey those out of gratitude for the benefit; if one has\nremained in a country in which one knows one is expected to obey the\nlaws and one has relied on them for benefit, one has (at least\nimplicitly) promised to obey them and should do so for that reason; if\none\u2019s country\u2019s laws work to promote the general good, one\nought to obey them as part of promoting general good (RG 27\u201328).\n\nRoss does not think the five duties are of equal initial weight. The\nduty of non-maleficence is weightier than the duty to promote a\nmaximum of aggregate good (RG 21, 22; FE 75, 130n1). He writes:\n\u2018We think the principle \u2018do evil to no one\u2019 more\npressing than the principle \u2018do good to every one\u2019, except\nwhen the evil is very substantially outweighed by the good\u2019 (FE\n75). It takes substantial (net) benefit to justify intentionally\nharming someone. It would be wrong to harm someone to promote only a\nmarginal (net) benefit (contra utilitarianism).\n\nRoss suggests in addition the duties of fidelity, reparation, and\ngratitude are in general weightier than the duty to promote general\ngood (RG 19, 30, 41\u201342; FE 77, 76, 90, 187). It takes\nsubstantial (net) surplus value to justify begging off on one of these\nduties (RG 34\u201335). Unlike the duty to promote general good, the duties\nof fidelity, reparation and gratitude rest on personal relations with\nothers, generating special rather than general duties (FE 76, 186). It\nis important to Ross that we can stand in the obligation-generating\nrelations \u2018of promisee to promiser, of creditor to debtor, of\nwife to husband, of child to parent, of friend to friend, of fellow\ncountryman to fellow countryman, and the like\u2019 (RG 19; also 22;\nFE 76; OJ 124, 126). The duties core to these relationships are in\ngeneral weightier than the more general duty to promote the general\ngood. Rival views, as noted, ignore these morally significant\nrelations, or the \u2018highly personal character of duty\u2019, at\ntheir peril (RG 22). Finally, although he does not say it, his view\nwould surely be the duty of non-maleficence is weightier than the\nduties of reparation, gratitude, and fidelity: it is (unless much is\nat stake) wrong to harm others in order to fulfil these duties.\n\nRoss\u2019s introduction of a prima facie duty makes for\ncomplicated moral decision making. One way to further clarify the\nstructure of Ross\u2019s view is to examine what he says about what\nhe calls duty proper or our actual duty (RG 41). Suppose you\u2019ve\nagreed to meet a friend for coffee. On the way to meet your friend,\nyou witness an accident with several victims. You have taken first-aid\ncourses and are able to provide the accident victims with life-saving\ntreatment until the paramedics arrive. If you assist the accident\nvictims, you will not be able to meet your friend; if you meet your\nfriend, you will not be able to help the accident victims. So, you\neither break your promise or you benefit the accident victims. What is\nyour actual obligation in this (simple) case?\n\nRoss thinks right acts or our actual obligations have \u2018the\ngreatest balance of prima facie, rightness, in those respects\nin which they are prima facie right, over their prima\nfacie wrongness, in those respects in which they are prima\nfacie wrong\u2019 (RG 41; FE 85). In order to figure out which,\nof the acts open to you, has the greatest balance of prima\nfacie rightness over prima facie wrongness you have to\nlook at all the acts open to you and determine all the ways in which\nthey are prima facie right and all the ways in which they are\nprima facie wrong and then figure out in each case the\nbalance of prima facie rightness over prima facie\nwrongness or vice versa (whichever the case may be). You then compare\nthe acts open to you in terms of their balance of overall\nprima facie rightness. The act with the greatest balance of\noverall prima facie rightness is the one you ought all things\nconsidered to do and what you ought all things considered to do is\nyour duty proper (for detailed discussion, see Hurka 2014, 69\u201378;\nOlsen 2014; Phillips 2019, 17\u201326).\n\nIn the simple case you look at the two acts open to you: meet your\nfriend or aid the accident victims. Meeting your friend is prima\nfacie right because it comprises keeping your promise, but\nprima facie wrong because it involves failing to maximise\ngeneral good (in your circumstances). Helping the accident victims is\nwrong to the extent it involves breaking a promise, but right because\nit involves benefitting the victims. Ross says while there are no\ngeneral rules \u2018[f]or the estimation of the comparative\nstringency of . . . prima facie obligations\u2019 (RG 41),\nhis judgement is on reflection saving the accident victims is\nweightier than keeping your promise (RG 18), in which case, of the two\nacts, aiding the accident victims has on balance more prima\nfacie rightness. Helping the accident victims is, then, all\nthings considered, what you ought to do and therefore it is the right\nact \u2013 your actual duty \u2013 of those open to you.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what Ross thinks of the relationship between\nprima face duties and duty proper. In RG, Ross\nsuggests that the notion of our actual duty or duty proper is basic\nand that the notion of a prima facie duty could be defined in\nterms of it. So in the simple case discussed above Ross claimed that\nour actual duty was to help the accident victims and that prima\nfacie duties could be defined in terms of contributing to or\npotentially explaining why it is our duty proper. In this case, the\nidea of a prima facie duty and our actual duty are not in the\nend distinct (Hurka 2014, 75). \n\nHe seemed to change his mind about this in FE, where following Broad,\nhe took the idea of a prima facie duty to be basic and he\nunderstood it in terms of fittingness to some aspect of a situation\n(FE 79\u201382, 84; Broad 1930, 218\u2013220). In the simple case above, keeping\nyour promise to your friend is a prima facie duty as it is\nfitting to one aspect of the situation and benefitting the accident\nvictims is another prima facie duty as it is fitting to\nanother aspect of the situation. It is not entirely clear whether in\nFE Ross relied on to the concept of duty proper or instead whether he\nrelied on the idea of duty all things considered (Hurka 2014,\n74\u201375). In any case, Ross\u2019s view in FE is that we can\nunderstand prima face duty independently of the notion duty\nall things considered and we can define or understand the latter in\nterms of the former. \n\nRoss\u2019s pluralism faces attack from two opposing camps, from\nthose who think there are fewer than five basic responsibilities and\nfrom those who think there are more. Ross intimates his list is the\nbest representation of the core commitments of common-sense\nmorality (RG 20; FE 190). He is sanguine we have these\nresponsibilities. He says, for example, \u2018the existence of an\nobligation arising from the making of a promise is so axiomatic that\nno moral universe can be imagined in which it would not exist\u2019\n(FE 77; also KT 42). He is not entirely confident there exist only\nfive basic responsibilities. His list is offered \u2018without\nclaiming completeness or finality for it\u2019 (RG 20; also 23).\n\nRoss is not hostile to the idea we might recognise a \u2018new\nduty\u2019 in light of new circumstances (FE 189). However, he does\nsay \u2018the general principles which it [i.e., intuitionism]\nregards as intuitively seen to be true are very few in number and very\ngeneral in character\u2019 (FE 190). He seems to think most disputes\nabout his list would revolve around what should be added rather than\nwhat should be subtracted, since the responsibilities listed above are\n\u2018authentic\u2019 (RG 23), that is, responsibilities revealed\nupon sober reflection. But if new circumstances can lead to the\nrecognition of new duties, why may they not lead to the recognition\nthere are fewer basic duties than we might otherwise have supposed?\nThis seems to be the nub of the issue between Ross and his ideal\nutilitarian foes.\n\nIdeal utilitarians and others are keen to argue that Ross\u2019s view\nis problematic because it is not systematic enough. In Some\nProblems in Ethics, H. W. B. Joseph suggested views like\nRoss\u2019s go wrong, since \u2018our obligations are not a heap of\nunrelated obligations\u2019 (Joseph 1931 92; also 67\u201368). Forty\nyears later, Rawls registered the same complaint: without some account\nof how the plurality of normative principles are to be weighed against\none another using \u2018reasonable ethical criteria, the means of\nrational discussion have come to an end. An intuitionist conception of\njustice [and by extension ethics] is, one might say, but half a\nconception\u2019 (Rawls 1971, 41).\n\nRoss is moved in part by this sort of worry. He initially lists what\nappear to be seven responsibilities, including a responsibility of\njustice (a responsibility to bring about \u2018a distribution of\nhappiness between other people in proportion to merit\u2019 (RG 26,\n21)) and a responsibility of self-improvement (a responsibility to\nimprove oneself in respect of virtue and knowledge (RG 21)). He argues\nthese can be subsumed by the responsibility \u2018that we should\nproduce as much good as possible\u2019 (RG 27; also 30; FE\n288\u201389). His version of beneficence involves the promotion of as\nmuch as possible of the four goods of pleasure, virtue, knowledge and\njustice (RG 27, 154).\n\nBut Ross does not think that further contraction is warranted:\n\u2018[l]oyalty to the facts is worth more than a symmetrical\narchitectonic or a hastily reached simplicity\u2019 (RG 23; also FE\n83; OJ 125). Indeed, his case against his ideal utilitarian foes\nMoore, Rashdall, and Joseph is strong since they adopt a form of\nvalue pluralism for similar reasons. In the context of\ndefending his value pluralism, Moore says we cannot assume the\n\u2018truth on any subject-matter will display such symmetry as we\ndesire to see . . . [t]o search for \u2018unity\u2019 or\n\u2018system\u2019 at the expense of truth, is not, I take it, the\nproper business of philosophy\u2019 (Moore 1903, 222).\n\nRoss has a further argument against Rawls. Rawls\u2019s theory\ncontains two principles of justice, lexically ordered. His first\nprinciple outlining a set of basic rights takes priority over his\nsecond principle outlining the correct distribution of social benefits\nand burdens. Rawls does not think it is ever right to violate rights\nin order to produce just distributions. This gets him a theory as\nsystematic as his classical average utilitarian rival and more\nsystematic than Ross\u2019s theory. But Ross can argue Rawls achieves\nsystem at the expense of endorsing absolutism, which many acknowledge\nto have counterintuitive results. Might gaining a massive benefit for\nthe least well off not justify a trivial rights violation? \n\nRoss hopes to show his view comprises the best representation of\ncommon-sense morality or, as noted above, what \u2018we\u2019 think.\nWe might wonder whether this is the case. It is relatively clear most\nhedonistic utilitarians are reformers of common-sense morality (e.g.,\nBentham 1789; Mill 1863, 1843; Sidgwick 1907). These philosophers may\nnot be moved (at the level of moral foundations) by claims their view\nconflicts with common-sense morality. For their aim in part is to\nrevise it and make moral deliberation more systematic. Ross gives\nhedonism short shrift because he thinks it obvious pleasure is not the\nonly intrinsic value (RG 17, 99; FE 65). He often argues ideal\nutilitarianism, like hedonistic utilitarianism, can be dismissed\nbecause it is at odds with common-sense morality (RG 17\u201319, 38;\nFE 67ff.). Yet, it is far from clear ideal utilitarianism is reformist\nlike hedonistic or classical utilitarianism. The better way to\nrepresent the dispute between ideal utilitarians and Ross is over\nwhich view best represents common-sense moral thinking. It is\ncertainly true that the main proponents of ideal utilitarianism took\nthemselves to be aiming to provide the best representation of\ncommon-sense morality (e.g., Rashdall 1907; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b,\n152; Johnson 1953).\n\nAs Ross conducts it, the main dispute between the two revolves around\nthe issue of whether ideal utilitarians can make sense of the\nobligation to keep one\u2019s promises. Ross\u2019s view is\n\u2018[t]o make a promise is not merely to adapt an ingenious device\nfor promoting the general well-being; it is to put oneself in a new\nrelation to one person in particular, a relation which creates a\nspecifically new prima facie duty to him, not reducible to\nthe duty of promoting the general well-being of society\u2019 (RG\n38). (To clarify that Ross\u2019s target is ideal utilitarianism here\nwe have to substitute good for well-being as Ross does elsewhere (RG\n34\u201336). Ideal utilitarians can agree with Ross\u2019s point as\nstated. It might be true that promises are not a device for promoting\nwell-being but false they are not a device for promoting the good,\nwhich is the point ideal utilitarians wish to make.)\n\nRoss employs the following example to illustrate his initial case (RG\n34\u201335). Suppose by fulfilling a promise to Edward you produce\n100 units of (surplus) good for him, but by breaking the promise and\ndoing something else you have not promised to do you produce 101 units\nof (surplus) good for James. The ideal utilitarian view entails it is\nwrong to fulfil the promise: we must benefit James. But this is not\nthe verdict of common-sense morality. Ross says it takes a much\ngreater disparity in value between the two to justify breaking the\npromise (RG 35; FE 77, 90).\n\nIn reply, the ideal utilitarian may try to capture the common-sense\nverdict by noting breaking promises erodes mutual confidence and\nkeeping promises enhances mutual confidence (RG 38; FE 187). These\ngoods and evils tip the balance in favour of keeping the promise. Ross\nfrowns on this response. There will no doubt be cases, he says, where\nall the benefits of breaking the promise will outweigh (though only\nvery slightly) all the costs associated with breaking it, and in this\ncase the ideal utilitarian will have to admit it is obligatory to\nbreak the promise (RG 38). Ross thinks this is not the verdict of\ncommon-sense morality.\n\nClassical utilitarians might think in this case we should revise\ncommon-sense morality. If after all is said and done, it is better to\nbreak a promise, we should break it. They might insist that on sober\nreflection common sense is mistaken and promises just are devices for\npromoting well-being. Ideal utilitarians seem to opt for a different\nstrategy.\n\nIn an engaging set of essays, W. A. Pickard-Cambridge presses Ross on\nthe issue of whether ideal utilitarianism is actually as at odds with\ncommon-sense morality as Ross suggests (Pickard-Cambridge 1932a,\n1932b, 1932c). Pickard-Cambridge first argues there are strong direct\nand indirect reasons for taking promises very seriously\n(Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 153\u2013157). He argues further ideal\nutilitarianism accounts better for our common-sense attitudes about\ncases of the following kind:\n\nChuck has promised Peter he will replace a string on his violin by\n4:00 pm tomorrow. Just before Chuck intends to fulfil the promise\nPeter contracts an illness making it impossible for him ever to use\nhis violin. It appears Chuck is not bound to fulfil the promise. This\nis the verdict of the plain man and the verdict of the ideal\nutilitarian, but it is not the verdict entailed by Ross\u2019s view\n(Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 158).\nA rich miser pretends to be a pauper in order to get Richard to\nagree to pay him $100. Richard takes pity on him, and he agrees to pay\nhim the money in six months. Richard discovers a few months later\nthrough newspapers reports the miser is a fraud. Richard has no reason\nto fulfil the promise. Again, this is the verdict of the plain man and\nthe verdict of the ideal utilitarian, but it is not the verdict that\nseems entailed by Ross\u2019s view (Pickard-Cambridge 1932b,\n165\u2013166).\nA poor man contacts Anne via the Internet asking her to please pay\nhim $100.00 in six months. Anne agrees to give him the money. Three\nmonths later, before Anne has paid the money, the poor man wins the\nlottery and is rich. The ideal utilitarian says she is not bound to\nfulfil the promise and the plain man agrees, but this is not\nRoss\u2019s verdict (Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 166).\n\n\nIn response to (1), Ross argues we must insist on \u2018some common\nsense in the interpretation of the promise\u2019 (FE 94; also 95,\n96). Both Peter and Chuck assume if by 3:00 Peter is rendered unable\never to use his violin, the promise is null and void. But the ideal\nutilitarian may say she can provide an interpretation of the promise\nand that her interpretation and its explanation fit more easily with\ncommon-sense morality. Peter and Chuck assume what they do because no\ngood would otherwise come from insisting on the promise being\nfulfilled.\n\nIn reply to (2), Ross says the promise \u2018arose out of\nconversation with the miser, which was conducted under the implied\ncontract to tell each other the truth\u2019 (FE 97). The miser lied.\nTherefore, the promise is null and void. The difficulty with this\nreply is for it to work Ross has to assume the implied contract\nstipulates we are to tell each other the whole or all the truth. But\nhe may not be entitled to this assumption. It is not obvious that when\nI sell you something I am required to tell you all the truths about\nthe item for sale. The ideal utilitarian is in a better position to\nexplain why in the case of the miser the implied contract to tell the\ntruth requires one not lie about being a beggar. The contract is\nspecified this way because it is beneficial for it to be so specified:\nit is not in general beneficial to honour fraudulent promises.\n\nIn reply to (3), Ross contends, initially, if Anne has \u2018a very\ndelicate sense of honour\u2019, she ought to consider paying the poor\nman on account of her carelessness in agreeing unconditionally in the\nfirst place (FE 97). This is not plausible. There is no reason to\nenrich an already rich person merely because of carelessness (of this\nsort). Ross further argues what is promised is not that Anne pay\n$100.00; rather, what is promised is she pay a poor man $100.00, and\nsince the man in question is no longer poor, there is therefore no\nneed to fulfil the promise (FE 97\u201398). But what drives this\ninterpretation of the promise? The ideal utilitarian may say the\nreason we interpret the promise this way is doing so is on balance\nbeneficial. Furthermore, the ideal utilitarian can argue that even\nwithout thinking of this interpretation of the promise we still\nbelieve we have no or only very weak reasons to pay, and that they can\noffer the best explanation of this fact. They can also explain why\nthis is (as Ross notes) a somewhat difficult issue to decide: there\nare utilitarian reasons on either side.\n\nPickard-Cambridge further argues ideal utilitarianism provides the\nbest explanation of the strength of a promise (1932b, 159\u2013163).\nRoss agrees some promises are more binding than others. A promise to\nvisit a sick friend is stronger than the promise to attend the theatre\nwith friends (FE 100). He suggests the former is stronger because of\nthe value of what is being promised (FE 100). An explicit promise is\nmore binding than a casual promise and more recent promise is more\nbinding than an older promise. Ross says this is because the manner in\nwhich and the time at which a promise has been made \u2018intensify\nthe promiser\u2019s awareness of its existence and the\npromisee\u2019s expectation of its fulfilment\u2019 (FE 101). These\nresponses seem to play right into the hands of the ideal utilitarian:\nthe promise is more binding when more value is at stake and when the\npromisee\u2019s expectations (and possible disappointment) are\ngreater, all of which are goods the ideal utilitarian claims we need\nto balance in deciding what we ought all things considered to do.\n\nRoss has one final reply to Pickard-Cambridge, using the following\nexample. A is dying. He entrusts his property to B,\non the strength of B\u2019s promise to give it to\nC. C does not know of A\u2019s intentions\nor B\u2019s promise. B\u2019s activities will not\ndisappoint A or C, nor will his activities\nnegatively impact the general mutual confidence. Suppose D\ncould make better use of the property than C. It follows on\nideal utilitarianism B ought to give the property to\nD. Ross thinks this breach of trust \u2018outrageous\u2019\n(FE 105).\n\nThe version of ideal utilitarianism to which Pickard-Cambridge\nsubscribes seems to entail B has no reason to fulfil the promise to A.\nThis is a problem for the view. However, Ross\u2019s own view may\nimply revision in this case, too. He says \u2018[w]hen we consider\nourselves bound\u2026to fulfil a promise, we think of the fulfilment\nof the promise as the bringing into existence of some source of\npleasure or satisfaction for the person to whom we have made the\npromise\u2019 (RG 162). This suggests the rightness of the promise\ndepends on it producing some pleasure or satisfaction for A.\nBut since A is dead when B fulfils the promise no\npleasure or satisfaction can be brought into existence for A,\nimplying that B has no obligation by Ross\u2019s lights to\nfulfil the promise.\n\nOf course, Ross might drop the requirement that the fulfilment of a\npromise must produce pleasure for the promisee and suggest instead\nonly the fulfilment of a promise be \u2018bonific\u2019 for someone\n(e.g., C) (RG 36; Ross 1928\u201329: 267\u201368). This seems to put him at odds\nwith the plain man in other cases, however. Consider a deathbed\npromise with a different content, that A be buried with\nC, his wife. Suppose this promise is not bonific. Ross will\nhave to say there is no reason to fulfil it (though perhaps he could\nclaim that fulfilling the promise is bonific since it satisfies\nA\u2019s desire (Skelton 2013a)). Hence, he may have to advocate\nrevision to common-sense morality. Perhaps he can argue his revision\nis more conservative than the revisions required by ideal\nutilitarianism. But this is a very thin difference; it may not be\nenough to give Ross the edge. Given these worries and the fact that\nideal utilitarianism seems quite close to the plain man or\ncommon-sense morality in many of the other important cases, its\nentailing it is right to break the promise in the initial case above\ncan hardly be considered a death blow.\n\nThe ideal utilitarian may not be satisfied with this outcome. Perhaps\nthe more appropriate route is not to opt for revision to common-sense\nmorality. For this may in the end give Ross a philosophical advantage,\nespecially if there is hope he can find satisfactory replies to\nPickard-Cambridge\u2019s objections. Instead, perhaps the better\nstrategy is to capture the importance of promise keeping to\ncommon-sense morality by holding that keeping promises is\nnon-instrumentally good or at least that breaking a promise is\nnon-instrumentally bad (Brennan 1989; Ewing 1957, 1959; Johnson 1953,\n1959; Shaver 2011). The general strategy is to subsume all of\nRoss\u2019s non-utilitarian duties in this way. This is a compelling\nresponse. To assess it, it is important to examine his theory of\nvalue.\n\nBefore discussing Ross\u2019s theory of value, it is important to\nnote two other reactions to his list of duties.\n\nRoss\u2019s foes are not alone in recommending fewer duties than he\nallows. Some of Ross\u2019s fans advocate for reducing his initial\nlist of duties, too. Phillips, for example, agrees Ross holds, at\nleast initially, there are five foundational duties (Phillips 2019,\n58\u201359). However, Phillips thinks the best account of Ross\u2019s view\ninvolves jettisoning the duty of non-maleficence (the\nresponsibility not to harm or injure others) (Phillips 2019,\n86\u201390).\n\nRoss pays little attention to the duty of non-maleficence. His main\nfocus is his four other duties \u2013 fidelity, reparation, gratitude, and\nbeneficence \u2013 which have a similar structure. Each involves promoting\nsome good or goods (RG 162; 1928\u20139: 267\u201368). Phillips thinks at the\ncore of Ross\u2019s view is the notion of an agent-relative\nintensifier. We have a general reason to promote various goods on\ngrounds of beneficence, and the duties of fidelity, reparation, and\ngratitude function to intensify reasons to provide certain\ngoods to certain people (Phillips 2019, 67ff). So, for example, if I\ncan benefit a benefactor or a total stranger to the same degree, I\nhave more reason \u2013 the reason is more intense \u2013 to benefit my\nbenefactor because I have a responsibility of gratitude to them. The\nduty of non-maleficence is not like this: it does not involve\npromoting a good (Hurka 2014, 182\u201383; Phillips 2019, 86\u201387).\n\nPhillips thinks there are good reasons to jettison the duty of\nnon-maleficence. Ross suggests the duty of non-maleficence in some way\nconstrains what we are permitted to do to promote general good. It is\nnot permissible, for example, to kill one person to prevent two other\npeople from being killed. Phillips thinks this leaves Ross susceptible\nto the paradox of deontology, which says it is paradoxical to hold\nsomeone\u2019s being harmed provides a consideration\nagainst, say, torturing, but not a consideration\nfavouring acting to prevent people from being harmed, say, by\nbeing tortured by someone else. The concern is: How can it be wrong to\nharm one person when by harming one person one can prevent two other\npeople from being harmed?\n\nPhillips does not abandon non-maleficence entirely. Instead, he\nattempts to capture our intuitions about the distinctive badness of\nharming or injuring by treating harming or injuring as a higher-level\nevil, involving an unfitting attitude (willing or wanting) toward a\nbase-level evil (harming or injuring) (Phillips 2019, 89). It is\nvicious to want to harm or injure someone, because harming or injuring\nanother person is bad. If we think of harming or injuring as a\nhigher-level evil we can, Phillips thinks, explain why harming is\nworse than failing to benefit, since \u2018[n]onbeneficence does not\nnecessarily involve any similar unfitting attitude\u2019 (Phillips\n2019, 89), though Phillip\u2019s suggestion will not capture the idea\nit is wrong to harm one person in order to prevent two from being\nharmed.\n\nPhillips\u2019s amendment may not recommend itself to Ross.\nJettisoning a requirement not to harm others involves giving up a\nsalient part of common-sense morality, involving the idea, as Ross\nputs it, of a duty based on people possessing \u2018definite rights,\nor at least claims, not to be made means to the giving of pleasure to\nothers; and claims that ought to be respected unless the net pleasure,\nor good, to be gained for the community by other action is very\nconsiderable\u2019 (FE 75). Phillip\u2019s suggestion may force us\nto reconsider whether interpreting the duties of promise keeping,\nreparation and gratitude as agent-relative intensifiers is right for\nRoss.\n\nIn addition, it is far from clear Phillips has established harming is\na distinctive evil as compared with nonbeneficence. Phillips says\nwhereas harming or injuring involves the unfitting attitude of wanting\nor aiming at a base bad (harm or injury), failure to benefit involves\nno bad attitude and so is not as bad as harming (Phillips 2019, 89).\nThis may not be obvious. When I fail to benefit I am\nindifferent to something good. This seems a wrong attitude to\nhave to a base good (benefits), making nonbeneficence no worse than\nharming. Of course, it is possible this indifference is not\nnecessarily involved in nonbeneficence, in which case it\nwould not be as bad harming or injuring. But it is far from clear that\nwhen I harm someone I necessarily will or desire injuring or\nharming them, in which case harming would not be worse than\nnonbeneficence. I might merely be aiming or willing benefits that my\nharming produces (for these criticisms, see Shaver 2020, 508).\n\nA different reaction to Ross\u2019s lists of duties is to argue it\nincludes too few responsibilities. Sidgwick famously claimed egoism\nand utilitarianism represent coordinate but conflicting requirements\nof rationality. On his view, we ought to maximise our own happiness\nand maximise general happiness (Sidgwick 1907, 496\u2013509). Sidgwick\nthought it could not be proved to the egoist that their happiness was\nnot for them all important and so the egoist could not be rationally\nconverted to utilitarianism (Sidgwick 1907, 420). (Sidgwick did think\nhe could convert adherents of something like Ross\u2019s view to\nutilitarianism (Sidgwick 1907, 337\u2013361.)) In defending egoism,\nSidgwick endorsed the existence of non-derivative agent-relative\nreasons. My good provides me with a special reason to promote my\nhappiness, a reason individuals other than me lack. These reasons\ncompete and (sometimes) conflict with the agent neutral reasons\nprovided by utilitarianism.\n\nChanneling Sidgwick, Phillips argues Ross should admit agent-relative\nreasons or intensifiers relating to one\u2019s own happiness.\nPhillips thinks \u2018[t]he fact that a pain will befall me rather\nthan someone else gives me a special extra reason to be concerned with\nthe pain \u2013 special extra reason that other people don\u2019t have.\nFacts about personal identity, that is, are agent-relative\nintensifiers of hedonic reasons\u2019 (Phillips 2019, 75). Many\nphilosophers agree (e.g., Butler 1736, 137, Price 1787, 148\u2013151,\nParfit 2011, 131).\n\nRoss does not think we have agent-relative moral reasons of this sort\nbecause he does not think there is a moral duty to promote\none\u2019s own happiness. He says \u2018the act of seeking pleasure\nfor oneself is not merely not obligatory, but has not even the\nspecific kind of rightness or fitness which is moral fitness. It seems\nmorally entirely colourless\u2019 (FE 277; also 272, 282, 288; RG\n151). We might agree it is it odd to say one has a moral duty to\npromote one\u2019s own happiness (though see Shaver 2014, 213\u201318 for\ndiscussion).\n\nThe difficulty is Ross seems to be of the view we have no reason\nwhatsoever to promote our own happiness (Parfit 2011, 372). He thinks\nthe only duties in existence are moral duties. This is hard to accept.\nIt does seem for many one\u2019s own happiness or one\u2019s own\nunhappiness provides one with reasons or obligations, though not\nnecessarily moral reasons or obligations. (Phillips can easily\naccommodate this thought since he holds the best way to understand\nprima facie duties is in terms of reasons rather than moral\nreasons or duties.)\n\nRoss seems also to think we have no reason to avoid our own pain. This\ncomes out clearly in his characterisations of the duty of\nnon-maleficence. It comprises a duty not to injure\n\u2018others\u2019 (RG 21); the duty rests on the fact that\n\u2018if there are things that are bad in themselves we ought,\nprima facie, not to bring them upon others\u2019 (RG 26). He\nseems, then, to think while I have a prima facie duty not to\nharm others, I have no such duty not to harm myself. It seems to\nfollow, then, it would not be morally wrong for me to impose a very\nlarge pain on myself to avoid only a trivial pain for another. It\nwould not be wrong, then, for me to make myself a mere \u2018means to\nthe giving of pleasure to others\u2019 (FE 75). This is hard to\naccept even if we accept Ross\u2019s view there exist only moral\nduties. It seems morally wrong to use oneself in this way. And even if\nwe are convinced we lack a moral duty to prevent our own pain we are\nvery unlikely to be convinced we lack strong non-moral reason to\nprevent it. Ross may have to modify his duty of non-maleficence to\naccommodate this.\n\nThese are not the only additions to Ross\u2019s list one might\nadvocate. Curiously missing from Ross\u2019s list is a prima\nfacie duty of veracity. We might agree with him (pace\nKant) when the (net) benefits of lying are considerable we have an\nobligation to lie, but disagree with his claim veracity is not a\nfoundational prima facie duty like fidelity and gratitude.\nRoss does not give an argument for why there is no foundational\nprima facie duty of veracity.\n\nRoss\u2019s thought seems to be the duty can be accounted for in\nterms of his five, foundational duties. As noted, Ross says the duty\nnot to lie rests in part on the duty of non-maleficence. It is wrong\nto lie because it involves inflicting a positive injury on another\nperson (RG 55). This might be true in part. But one might imagine\nsomeone replying with a claim similar to the one Ross makes in reply\nto utilitarian attempts to show the duty of fidelity to promises is\nnot foundational, namely, that, like promise keeping, veracity is not\njust a device for preventing bad outcomes. Even in cases where lying\nis beneficial it still might be prima facie wrong, for while\nit does not harm or injure anyone in Ross\u2019s sense, it does\nbypass another\u2019s will in an objectionable way.\n\nRoss also suggests lying is wrong because it involves breaking an\nimplicit promise \u2018not to tell ties which seems to be implied in\nthe act of entering into conversation\u2019 (RG 21; FE 97). Again,\nthis might capture some of what we think wrong with lying, but it may\nnot provide the full account of what makes it wrong. Ross says when\n\u2018we consider ourselves bound . . . to fulfil a promise, we think\nof the fulfilment of the promise as the bringing into existence of\nsome source of pleasure or satisfaction for the person to whom we have\nmade the promise\u2019 (RG 162). When we consider ourselves bound to\ntell the truth we are not clearly of the view doing so will promote\npleasure for the individual to whom we owe the obligation. Think here\nof being asked to provide an honest assessment of a student\u2019s\nwork. We think we ought to tell the truth, but this is not obviously\naccompanied by the thought doing so will bring into existence pleasure\nfor the student.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that we might think telling the truth is\naccompanied by the thought doing so will produce some other good\n(e.g., knowledge or insight) in which case Ross might be right the\nduty to tell the truth rests on the duty to fulfil a promise. But\nsomeone keen on a prima facie duty of veracity might insist\neven when no good is at stake it might still be prima facie\nright to tell the truth. It is hard to know what Ross can say to\nsomeone who insists on a self-standing prima facie duty of\nveracity (like Price 1787, 153).\n\nRoss mentions one good to be promoted under the duty of beneficence is\nthe good of justice which for him involves \u2018the bringing about\nof a distribution of happiness between other people in proportion to\nmerit\u2019 or virtue (RG 26; also 21, 27, 28, 138, 153\u2013154; FE 286).\nThis is but one element of justice, as Ross allows. He says many\nexisting injustices in his sense are due to \u2018social and economic\nsystems which we have \u2026 taken part in and assented to\u2019\n(RG 28) (including, we should imagine as Ross did not, the colonialism\nfrom which Ross\u2019s own college \u2013 Oriel College \u2013\nbenefitted (Clarke 1971, 327)). He says this fact reinforces our\nobligations of justice.\n\nRoss may be right. But our obligations to disrupt these systems is not\nmerely a matter of restoring justice in Ross\u2019s sense. It might\nbe the case that we have a prima facie obligation to\nfacilitate fair or equitable outcomes in the distribution of wealth\nand income that are unrelated to restoring or preventing injustice in\nRoss\u2019s case. Indeed, we might argue it is more important to\nachieve some fairness in the distribution of income and wealth and it\nwould be right to achieve it even at the expense of justice in\nRoss\u2019s sense.\n\nThere are other issues of justice Ross does not touch on. For example,\nRoss says very little about equality in the distribution of scare\nresources. Some think in distributing scarce medical resources (e.g.,\nICU beds) we ought to give priority to the least well off. Ross might\nthink considerations of this sort are captured by the duty of\nbeneficence. But many might think we should give priority to the least\nwell off even if this fails to promote the best outcomes. Ross may\nneed to include a prima facie duty of equity in his list to\naccommodate the full inventory of issues relating to justice.\n",
