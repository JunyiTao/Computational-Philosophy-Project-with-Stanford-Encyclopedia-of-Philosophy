    "main_text": "The Varieties of Cognitive Success || Constraints and Values\n1.2 Constraints and Values\n\nSome kinds of cognitive success involve compliance with a\nconstraint, while others involve the realization or promotion\nof values. We can contrast these two kinds of success by\ncontrasting the associated kinds of failure: failure to comply with a\nconstraint results in impermissibility, whereas failure to\nrealize some values results in\n sub-optimality.[8]\n Of course, if sub-optimality is always impermissible and vice\nversa, then the extension of these two categories ends\nup being the same, even if the two categories are not themselves the\nsame. But it is implausible to regard all sub-optimality as\nepistemically impermissible: cognitive success does not\nrequire us to be perfectly cognitively optimal in every way.\nIf cognitive success is ever achievable even in principle, then at\nleast some degree of cognitive sub-optimality must be permissible.\nAchieving greater optimality than what\u2019s required for cognitive\npermissibility could then be understood as cognitive\nsupererogation. If such supererogation is possible, at least\nin principle, then the permissible can fall short of the optimal.\n\nRecent controversies concern not merely the relation between\npermissibility and optimality, but also the metaphysical basis of each\nkind of success. In virtue of what is some state, or act, or process,\nor relation, epistemically permissible? And in virtue of what is it\noptimal to whatever degree it is? Epistemic consequentialists take the\nanswer to the former question to be determined by appeal to the answer\nto the latter. For instance, one popular form of epistemic\nconsequentialism claims that a particular way of forming one\u2019s\nbeliefs about the world is epistemically permissible just in so far as\nit promotes the possession of true belief and the avoidance of false\n belief.[9]\n Another form of consequentialism, consistent with but distinct from\nthe first, says that a \u201ccredence function\u201d (i.e., a\nfunction from propositions to degrees of confidence) is optimal just\nin so far as it promotes a single parameter\u2014overall\naccuracy\u2014which is measured in such a way that, the higher\none\u2019s confidence in true propositions and the lower one\u2019s\nconfidence in false propositions, the greater one\u2019s overall\n accuracy.[10]\n There are also some forms of epistemic consequentialism according to\nwhich optimality involves promotion of ends that are practical rather\nthan simply\n alethic.[11]\n An important controversy in the recent literature concerns the\nquestion of whether epistemic consequentialism is true (see Berker\n2013, which develops a line of argument found in Firth 1978 [1998]).\nAnother prominent controversy is carried on among consequentialists\nthemselves, and concerns the question of what values are such that\ntheir realization or promotion constitutes optimality.\n\nWe\u2019ve used the term \u201cconstraint\u201d to denote the\nbounds of what is epistemically permissible. Of course, as a matter of\ndeontic logic, what is permissible must include at least what is\nrequired: for a condition to be required is simply for the complement\nof that condition to not be permissible. But this leaves it open\nwhether, in a particular domain, what is permissible includes more\nthan what is required. Permissivists argue that it does (see\nSchoenfield 2014 for a defense of permissivism), while\nanti-permissivists argue that it does not (see White 2005 and\nSchultheis 2018 for arguments against permissivism).\nAnti-permissivists concerning constraints on our credences are\nsometimes described as holding a \u201cuniqueness\u201d view, but\nthis label can easily mislead. A philosopher who thinks that the range\nof permissible credences is no wider than the range of required\ncredences is an anti-permissivist\u2014but an anti-permissivist view,\nso understood, is consistent with the claim that the credences we are\nrequired to have are not point-valued but are rather interval-valued.\nSuch a philosopher could, for instance, claim that there is only one\ncredence that you are permitted to assign to the proposition that the\ncat is on the mat, and this required credence is neither .6 nor .7,\nbut is rather the open interval (.6, .7). \n",
