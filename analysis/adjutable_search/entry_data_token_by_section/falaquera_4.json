Falaquera as a commentator\n\n\nReference has been made to Falaquera\u2019s Moreh ha-Moreh, one of\nthe first commentaries on Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed. The commentary is not on the entire book, but on only\na little over a quarter of its chapters. Yet Maimonides had urged\nreaders of the Guide \u201cnot to comment upon a single word\nof it and not to explain to another anything in it.\u201d Falaquera\nwas aware of this plea, but also knew that people were already\nmisreading and misinterpreting the text. His own commentary is the\nfirst scholarly study of Maimonides\u2019 philosophic sources, a topic that\ncontinues to engage scholars to this day. The knowledge of these\nsources \u2013 usually cited by Falaquera by name or epithet \u2013\nand Maimonides\u2019 agreement or disagreement with them is essential for a\nproper understanding of the Guide. Like the\nDe\u2018ot ha-Filosofim, most of the\ncommentary is pieced together from translated passages from other\nworks, although here in the commentary he allows himself to comment,\nusually briefly and in his own name, on these passages. In addition to\ntranslating these sources, Falaquera retranslated his selections from\nthe Guide.\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Falaquera speaks explicitly in his own name in\nthe commentary, but rarely in most of his other works. Shiffman\ncharacterizes Falaquera in the commentary as a \u201ccritical thinker\nwho does not hesitate to disagree with those he cites, accepting only\nthose opinions which he considers philosophically sound\u201d\n(\u201cFalqerah As Interpreter,\u201d 7 [219]). On occasion\nFalaquera disagrees with and even criticizes Maimonides. At times the\nsources cited by Falaquera strengthen Maimonides\u2019 views and at\ntimes they part from them. In one instance, in his commentary\non Guide I, 68, Falaquera uncharacteristically adds a word\n(ha-maskil, the intellecting Subject) in his citation of the\nArabic translation of Metaphysics \u039b, perhaps in order\nfor it to agree exactly with Maimonides\u2019 statement with\nreference to God that He is Intellect, intellecting Subject, and\nObject of intellection [Harvey, \u201cNotes on Maimonides\u2019\nFormulations\u201d]. The idea to explain the Guide and its\nteachings through citations of Maimonides\u2019 possible sources is\nthe great innovation of the commentary. Usually these passages speak\nfor themselves with only short comments added by Falaquera.\nOccasionally he is more verbose, but even when not, there is a sense\nthat he is considering the passage at hand carefully to determine to\nwhat extent Maimonides followed its teachings and to what extent he\nhimself should. This is one of Falaquera\u2019s last writings and\nlikely the most useful of his books for discerning his own views on\ntheological-philosophical matters, such as creation from eternal\nmatter; God\u2019s will; the negation of corporeality, privation, and\npotentiality with regard to God; the nature of prophecy; the\npossibility of conjunction with the Active Intellect; and the ultimate\nand intermediate causes in nature, will, and chance.\n",
