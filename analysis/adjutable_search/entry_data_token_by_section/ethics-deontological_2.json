    "main_text": "Deontological Theories || Agent-Centered Deontological Theories\n2.1 Agent-Centered Deontological Theories\n\nThe most traditional mode of taxonomizing deontological theories is to\ndivide them between agent-centered versus victim-centered (or\n\u201cpatient-centered\u201d) theories (Scheffler 1988; Kamm 2007).\nConsider first agent-centered deontological theories. According to\nagent-centered theories, we each have both permissions and obligations\nthat give us agent-relative reasons for action. An agent-relative\nreason is an objective reason, just as are agent neutral reasons;\nneither is to be confused with either the relativistic reasons of a\nrelativist meta-ethics, nor with the subjective reasons that form the\nnerve of psychological explanations of human action (Nagel 1986). An\nagent-relative reason is so-called because it is a reason relative to\nthe agent whose reason it is; it need not (although it may) constitute\na reason for anyone else. Thus, an agent-relative obligation\nis an obligation for a particular agent to take or refrain from taking\nsome action; and because it is agent-relative, the obligation does not\nnecessarily give anyone else a reason to support that action. Each\nparent, for example, is commonly thought to have such special\nobligations to his/her child, obligations not shared by anyone else.\nLikewise, an agent-relative permission is a permission for\nsome agent to do some act even though others may not be permitted to\naid that agent in the doing of his permitted action. Each parent, to\nrevert to the same example, is commonly thought to be permitted (at\nthe least) to save his own child even at the cost of not saving two\nother children to whom he has no special relation. Agent-centered\ntheories and the agent-relative reasons on which they are based not\nonly enjoin each of us to do or not to do certain things; they also\ninstruct me to treat my friends, my family,\nmy promisees in certain ways because they are mine,\neven if by neglecting them I could do more for others\u2019 friends,\nfamilies, and promisees.\n\nAt the heart of agent-centered theories (with their agent-relative\nreasons) is the idea of agency. The moral plausibility of\nagent-centered theories is rooted here. The idea is that morality is\nintensely personal, in the sense that we are each enjoined to keep our\nown moral house in order. Our categorical obligations are not to focus\non how our actions cause or enable other agents to do evil; the focus\nof our categorical obligations is to keep our own agency free of moral\ntaint.\n\nEach agent\u2019s distinctive moral concern with his/her own agency puts\nsome pressure on agent-centered theories to clarify how and when our\nagency is or is not involved in various situations. Agent-centered\ntheories famously divide between those that emphasize the role of\nintention or other mental states in constituting the morally important\nkind of agency, and those that emphasize the actions of agents as\nplaying such a role. There are also agent-centered theories that\nemphasize both intentions and actions equally in constituting the\nmorally relevant agency of persons.\n\nOn the first of these three agent-relative views, it is most commonly\nasserted that it is our intended ends and intended means that most\ncrucially define our agency. Such intentions mark out what it is we\nset out to achieve through our actions. If we intend something bad as\nan end, or even as a means to some more beneficent end, we are said to\nhave \u201cset ourselves at evil,\u201d something we are\ncategorically forbidden to do (Aquinas Summa Theologica).\n\nThree items usefully contrasted with such intentions are\nbelief, risk, and cause. If we predict that\nan act of ours will result in evil, such prediction is a cognitive\nstate (of belief); it is not a conative state of intention to bring\nabout such a result, either as an end in itself or as a means to some\nother end. In this case, our agency is involved only to the extent\nthat we have shown ourselves as being willing to tolerate evil results\nflowing from our acts; but we have not set out to achieve such evil by\nour acts. Likewise, a risking and/or causing of some evil result is\ndistinct from any intention to achieve it. We can intend such a\nresult, and we can even execute such an intention so that it becomes a\ntrying, without in fact either causing or even risking it. (It is,\nhowever, true that we must believe we are risking the result\nto some extent, however minimal, for the result to be what we intend\nto bring about by our act.) Also, we can cause or risk such results\nwithout intending them. For example, we can intend to kill and even\ntry to kill someone without killing him; and we can kill him without\nintending or trying to kill him, as when we kill accidentally.\nIntending thus does not collapse into risking, causing, or predicting;\nand on the version of agent-centered deontology here considered, it is\nintending (or perhaps trying) alone that marks the involvement of our\nagency in a way so as to bring agent-centered obligations and\npermissions into play.\n\nDeontologists of this stripe are committed to something like the\ndoctrine of double effect, a long-established doctrine of Catholic\ntheology (Woodward 2001). The Doctrine in its most familiar form\nasserts that we are categorically forbidden to intend evils such as\nkilling the innocent or torturing others, even though doing such acts\nwould minimize the doing of like acts by others (or even ourselves) in\nthe future. By contrast, if we only risk, cause, or predict that our\nacts will have consequences making them acts of killing or of torture,\nthen we might be able to justify the doing of such acts by the\nkilling/torture-minimizing consequences of such actions. Whether such\ndistinctions are plausible is standardly taken to measure the\nplausibility of an intention-focused version of the agent-centered\nversion of deontology.\n\nThere are other versions of mental-state focused agent relativity that\ndo not focus on intentions (Hurd 1994). Some of these versions focus\non predictive belief as much as on intention (at least when the belief\nis of a high degree of certainty). Other versions focus on intended\nends (\u201cmotives\u201d) alone. Still others focus on the\ndeliberative processes that precede the formation of intentions, so\nthat even to contemplate the doing of an evil act impermissibly\ninvokes our agency (Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). But\nintention-focused versions are the most familiar versions of so-called\n\u201cinner wickedness\u201d versions of agent-centered\ndeontology.\n\nThe second kind of agent-centered deontology is one focused on\nactions, not mental states. Such a view can concede that all human\nactions must originate with some kind of mental state, often styled a\nvolition or a willing; such a view can even concede that volitions or\nwillings are an intention of a certain kind (Moore 1993, Ch. 6).\nIndeed, such source of human actions in willing is what plausibly\nconnects actions to the agency that is of moral concern on the\nagent-centered version of deontology. Yet to will the movement of a\nfinger on a trigger is distinct from an intention to kill a person by\nthat finger movement. The act view of agency is thus distinct from the\nintentions (or other mental state) view of agency.\n\nOn this view, our agent-relative obligations and permissions have as\ntheir content certain kinds of actions: we are obligated not to\nkill innocents for example. The killing of an innocent of\ncourse requires that there be a death of such innocent, but there is\nno agency involved in mere events such as deaths. Needed for there to\nbe a killing are two other items. One we remarked on before:\nthe action of the putative agent must have its source in a willing.\nBut the other maker of agency here is more interesting for present\npurposes: the willing must cause the death of the innocent\nfor an act to be a killing of such innocent. Much (on this\nview) is loaded into the requirement of causation.\n\nFirst, causings of evils like deaths of innocents are\ncommonly distinguished from omissions to prevent such deaths.\nHolding a baby\u2019s head under water until it drowns is a killing; seeing\na baby lying face down in a puddle and doing nothing to save it when\none could do so easily is a failure to prevent its death. Our\ncategorical obligations are usually negative in content: we are not to\nkill the baby. We may have an obligation to save it, but this will not\nbe an agent-relative obligation, on the view here considered, unless\nwe have some special relationship to the baby.\n\nSecond, causings are distinguished from allowings.\nIn a narrow sense of the word we will here stipulate, one\nallows a death to occur when: (1) one\u2019s action merely removes\na defense the victim otherwise would have had against death; and (2)\nsuch removal returns the victim to some morally appropriate baseline\n(Kamm 1994, 1996; MacMahan 2003). Thus, mercy-killings, or euthanasia,\nare outside of our deontological obligations (and thus eligible for\njustification by good consequences) so long as one\u2019s act: (1) only\nremoves a defense against death that the agent herself had earlier\nprovided, such as disconnecting medical equipment that is keeping the\npatient alive when that disconnecting is done by the medical personnel\nthat attached the patient to the equipment originally; and (2) the\nequipment could justifiably have been hooked up to another patient,\nwhere it could do some good, had the doctors known at the time of\nconnection what they know at the time of disconnection.\n\nThird, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none\u2019s acts merely enable (or aid) some other agent to cause\nsuch evil (Hart and Honore 1985). Thus, one is not categorically\nforbidden to drive the terrorists to where they can kill the policeman\n(if the alternative is death of one\u2019s family), even though one would\nbe categorically forbidden to kill the policeman oneself (even where\nthe alternative is death of one\u2019s family) (Moore 2008). Nor is one\ncategorically forbidden to select which of a group of villagers shall\nbe unjustly executed by another who is pursuing his own purposes\n(Williams 1973).\n\nFourth, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none merely redirects a presently existing threat to many so that it\nnow threatens only one (or a few) (Thomson 1985). In the time-honored\nexample of the run-away trolley (Trolley), one may turn a trolley so\nthat it runs over one trapped workman so as to save five workmen\ntrapped on the other track, even though it is not permissible for an\nagent to have initiated the movement of the trolley towards the one to\nsave five (Foot 1967; Thomson 1985).\n\nFifth, our agency is said not to be involved in mere\naccelerations of evils about to happen anyway, as opposed to\ncausing such evils by doing acts necessary for such evils to\noccur (G. Williams 1961; Brody 1996). Thus, when a victim is about to\nfall to his death anyway, dragging a rescuer with him too, the rescuer\nmay cut the rope connecting them. Rescuer is accelerating, but not\ncausing, the death that was about to occur anyway.\n\nAll of these last five distinctions have been suggested to be part and\nparcel of another centuries-old Catholic doctrine, that of the\ndoctrine of doing and allowing (see the entry on\n doing vs. allowing harm)\n (Moore 2008; Kamm 1994; Foot 1967; Quinn 1989). According to this\ndoctrine, one may not cause death, for that would be a\nkilling, a \u201cdoing;\u201d but one may fail to prevent death,\nallow (in the narrow sense) death to occur, enable another to cause\ndeath, redirect a life-threatening item from many to one, or\naccelerate a death about to happen anyway, if good enough consequences\nare in the offing. As with the Doctrine of Double Effect, how\nplausible one finds these applications of the doctrine of doing and\nallowing will determine how plausible one finds this cause-based view\nof human agency.\n\nA third kind of agent-centered deontology can be obtained by simply\nconjoining the other two agent-centered views (Hurd 1994). This view\nwould be that agency in the relevant sense requires both intending and\ncausing (i.e., acting) (Moore 2008). On this view, our agent-relative\nobligations do not focus on causings or intentions separately; rather,\nthe content of such obligations is focused on intended\ncausings. For example, our deontological obligation with respect\nto human life is neither an obligation not to kill nor an obligation\nnot to intend to kill; rather, it is an obligation not to\nmurder, that is, to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill.\n\nBy requiring both intention and causings to constitute human agency,\nthis third view avoids the seeming overbreadth of our obligations if\neither intention or action alone marked such agency. Suppose our\nagent-relative obligation were not to do some action such as\nkill an innocent \u2013is that obligation breached by a merely\nnegligent killing, so that we deserve the serious blame of having\nbreached such a categorical norm (Hurd 1994)? (Of course, one might be\nsomewhat blameworthy on consequentialist grounds (Hurd 1995), or\nperhaps not blameworthy at all (Moore and Hurd 2011).) Alternatively,\nsuppose our agent-relative obligation were not to intend to\nkill\u2014does that mean we could not justify forming such an\nintention when good consequences would be the result, and\nwhen we are sure we cannot act so as to fulfill such intention (Hurd\n1994)? If our agent-relative obligation is neither of these alone, but\nis rather, that we are not to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill, both such instances of seeming overbreadth in the reach of our\nobligations, are avoided.\n\nWhichever of these three agent-centered theories one finds most\nplausible, they each suffer from some common problems. A fundamental\nworry is the moral unattractiveness of the focus on self that is the\nnerve of any agent-centered deontology. The importance of each\nperson\u2019s agency to himself/herself has a narcissistic flavor to it\nthat seems unattractive to many. It seemingly justifies each of us\nkeeping our own moral house in order even at the expense of the world\nbecoming much worse. The worry is not that agent-centered deontology\nis just another form of egoism, according to which the content of\none\u2019s duties exclusively concern oneself; even so, the character of\nagent-relative duties is such that they betoken an emphasis on self\nthat is unattractive in the same way that such emphasis makes egoism\nunattractive. Secondly, many find the distinctions invited by the\nDoctrine of Double Effect and the (five versions of the) Doctrine of\nDoing and Allowing to be either morally unattractive or conceptually\nincoherent. Such critics find the differences between\nintending/foreseeing, causing/omitting, causing/allowing,\ncausing/enabling, causing/redirecting, causing/accelerating to be\nmorally insignificant. (On act/omission (Rachels 1975); on\ndoing/allowing (Kagan 1989); on intending/foreseeing (Bennett 1981;\nDavis 1984).) They urge, for example, that failing to prevent a death\none could easily prevent is as blameworthy as causing a death, so that\na morality that radically distinguishes the two is implausible.\nAlternatively, such critics urge on conceptual grounds that no clear\ndistinctions can be drawn in these matters, that foreseeing with\ncertainty is indistinguishable from intending (Bennett 1981), that\nomitting is one kind of causing (Schaffer 2012), and so forth.\n\nThirdly, there is the worry about \u201cavoision.\u201d By casting\nour categorical obligations in such agent-centered terms, one invites\na kind of manipulation that is legalistic and Jesuitical, what Leo\nKatz dubs \u201cavoision\u201d (Katz 1996). Some think, for example,\nthat one can transform a prohibited intention into a permissible\npredictive belief (and thus escape intention-focused forms of\nagent-relative duty) by the simple expedient of finding some other end\nwith which to motivate the action in question.\n\nSuch criticisms of the agent-centered view of deontology drive most\nwho accept their force away from deontology entirely and to some form\nof consequentialism. Alternatively, some of such critics are driven to\npatient-centered deontology, which we discuss immediately below. Yet\nstill other of such critics attempt to articulate yet a fourth form of\nagent-centered deontology. This might be called the \u201ccontrol\ntheory of agency.\u201d On this view, our agency is invoked whenever\nour choices could have made a difference. This cuts across the\nintention/foresight, act/omission, and doing/allowing distinctions,\nbecause in all cases we controlled what happened through our\nchoices (Frey 1995). Yet as an account of deontology, this seems\nworrisomely broad. It disallows consequentialist justifications\nwhenever: we foresee the death of an innocent; we omit to save, where\nour saving would have made a difference and we knew it; where we\nremove a life-saving device, knowing the patient will die. If\ndeontological norms are so broad in content as to cover all these\nforeseeings, omittings, and allowings, then good consequences (such as\na net saving of innocent lives) are ineligible to justify them. This\nmakes for a wildly counterintuitive deontology: surely I can, for\nexample, justify not throwing the rope to one (and thus omit to save\nhim) in order to save two others equally in need. This breadth of\nobligation also makes for a conflict-ridden deontology: by refusing to\ncabin our categorical obligations by the distinctions of the Doctrine\nof Double Effect and the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, situations of\nconflict between our stringent obligations proliferate in a\ntroublesome way (Anscombe 1962).\n",
