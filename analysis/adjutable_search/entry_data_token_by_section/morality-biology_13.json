Evolutionary Metaethics\n\nWhile evolutionary facts may do little to illuminate the\ncontent of morality in the normative sense (apart from\nshedding light on morally relevant facts), they are sometimes thought\nto tell us something about the existence and nature\nof morality in the normative sense. (See section 1.2 for the notion of\nmorality in the normative sense.) A number of philosophers have\nclaimed that evolutionary theory can be used to debunk certain\nmetaethical theories and perhaps to support others. One\nrelatively modest project along these lines would be to use\nevolutionary biology to undermine Aristotelian appeals to natural\nteleology in human life to account for ethical facts, along the lines\nof Foot (2001). This evolutionary-based critique of\n\u201cteleological naturalism\u201d in ethics (FitzPatrick 2000) is\ndiscussed in the\n\nSupplement on Natural Teleology in Ethics.\n \n\nOther projects involve using evolutionary biology to try to undermine\ntraditional\n moral realism\u2014the\n view that moral judgments can be true (accurately representing moral\nfacts) when construed literally, that their truth does not depend on\nour evaluative attitudes, and that we can know at least some of these\ntruths. Such arguments are taken to support moral skepticism\n(according to which we cannot possess moral knowledge) or\n moral antirealism\n (for example, views that construe moral truths as functions of our\nevaluative attitudes, or expressivist views according to which moral\njudgments function to express attitudes, acceptance of norms, etc.,\nrather than to represent moral facts, or error theoretic views\naccording to which all moral judgments are false).\n",
