Nonetheless, the\nbeginning of Western ethnopsychiatry and cross-cultural\npsychology\u2014the study of the cultural aspects of mental health\nand illness (Jovanovski 1995)\u2014predates the recent cultural turn\nin cognitive science. Early pioneers were iconoclasts of Western\npsychiatry, rejecting its ethnocentrism and setting out to discover\nwhat they could learn from non-Western approaches to mental suffering\n(Ellenberger 1959; Torrey 1972). Their research agendas were driven by\nquestions about the kinds of practices other cultures had developed to\ntreat individuals with behavioral or mental problems, and how culture\nis crucial to understand how individuals give meaning to their\nsymptoms (Good 1993). They were also concerned with how cultures\ndiffered in their conceptions of such problems, especially in how and\nwhere they drew the distinction between normal and abnormal mental\nconditions (Kleinman 1988; Fabrega 1991). What attracted the most\nattention, however, were inquiries into the nature and significance of\nso-called culture bound syndromes, those ways of being mentally unwell\nthat are confined to, or are only recognized as diseases within, a\nparticular culture. Well-studied examples of non-Western culture bound\nsyndromes include amok (an episode of rage that often ends in\nkilling, thought to be typical for the Indonesian Archipelago, see\nGriffiths 1997 for illuminating philosophical discussion)\nkoro (a genital-shrinkage anxiety, most common in China and\nSouthwest Asia, Crozier 2012), and latah (a condition\nassociated with a disordered startle response that can lead to\nabnormal and extreme behavior, found in southeast Asia, Simons 1996).\nOther candidates that might fit the description (or that may have fit\nit at one time) include old hag (Ness 1978), fugue (Hacking 1998),\nmultiple personality disorder (Hacking 1995a), anorexia nervosa (Banks\n1991), and the Truman Show delusion (Gold & Gold 2012, 2014).\n\nThe significance of this range of syndromes lies not in their\nstrangeness, but in the striking evidence they provide about the ways\nin which culture shapes mental illness. Indeed, it suggests that\nculture has a profound influence on several key dimensions of\npsychological dysfunction, affecting not just how it is diagnosed and\ntreated, but also how it is expressed and assigned social\nsignificance. For example, schizophrenics from different cultures\nexperience different kinds of auditory hallucinations, which they and\nthe members of their community interpret in different ways (Luhrmann\net al. 2015). The very existence of culture bound syndromes also\nsuggests the possibility that the forms of mental disorder common in\nWestern societies may be no exceptions to the rule. Certain eating\ndisorders, for instance, may be culturally transmitted, spreading\ncontagiously through social learning and media consumption\n(Vandereycken 2011). Evidence also suggests that while some cross\nculturally shared elements of PTSD flow from an innate human response\nto danger, others symptoms exhibit variation. For example, the\ndepressive symptoms associated with PTSD in American war veterans may\nbe the result of sufferers understanding themselves to have violated\ntheir own culture\u2019s moral norms (Zefferman & Mathew 2021;\nalso see Munch-Jurisic forthcoming).\n\nThe mounting evidence that mental disorder is so dramatically shaped\nby culture seemed to be unsettling. Mainstream psychiatry had long\naccepted the general claim that cultural factors can play a role in\nmental health and the etiology of disorders, by creating conditions\nthat trigger unhealthy levels of anxiety or stress, or by stabilizing\nother circumstances that elicit more extreme and pathological forms of\ndiscontent with civilization (Freud 1930). Nonetheless, cultural\nvariation in symptoms was given relatively little attention compared\nto what were thought to be the core, pan-cultural indicators of\nuniversal forms of dysfunction. Indeed, until recently, the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\ntreated disorders commonly found in WEIRD cultures, along with the way\nthey presented in symptoms, as (quasi-) universal, while classifying\nthose only found in other cultures as \u2018culture-bound\nsyndromes\u2019 and treating them as exotic outliers. Hence one\nextreme and slightly tongue-in-cheek description of the perspective\nadopted by the DSM: \u201cAmerican mental illness is universal, and\nother cultures have specific conditions\u201d (Murphy 2015).\n\nThis entrenched orthodoxy has drawn more critical scrutiny as cultural\napproaches to psychiatry have gained more traction. For instance, an\ninfluential \u2018network theory\u2019 of mental disorder shows that\nnetwork models can provide important new insights into the patterns of\ncausal interactions among symptoms, and how these patterns serve to\nstructure (certain) mental disorders (Borsboom, Cramer, & Kalis\n2019). A virtue of these models is that they allow for\nstraightforwardly cultural factors to be involved in the relevant\npatterns of causal interaction (also see Kendler, Zachar, & Craver\n2011). These models are thus able to capture, for example, the kinds\nof \u2018labelling effects\u2019 that have been posited to account\nfor the way that naming and talking about certain deviant forms of\nbehavior can stigmatize them, feeding back and influencing the\npsychological states of those who are so labelled, often producing\nfurther negative impacts on their mental health (see Hacking 1995b;\nTekin 2014; also see Mallon 2016 for more general discussion of\n\u2018looping effects\u2019 and their interaction with cognition;\ncf. Goffman 1961 for a sociological perspective on similar\nphenomena).\n\nFurther evidence of the unsettling of the orthodoxy is that the latest\nedition of the DSM explicitly dropped the terminology of\n\u2018culture bound syndromes\u2019, replacing it with\n\u2018cultural concepts of disease\u2019. The rationale for this\nmodification was that it \u201cacknowledges that all forms\nof distress are locally shaped, including the DSM disorders\u201d\n(American Psychiatric Association 2013, italics in original).\nNevertheless, there is reason to think the changes may be merely\ncosmetic and peripheral rather than indicative of a deeper structural\nreorientation of Western psychiatric institutions. Philosophical\ncritics have argued that at its heart the DSM remains committed to a\nbiomedical model of disease, still conceptualizing mental disorder via\nan analogy with somatic disease. This conception remains inadequate,\nthey argue, in no small part because it is unable to capture the deep\ninfluence of culture on minds and mental health (Tekin 2011; Tekin,\nFlanagan, & Graham 2017).\n\nNevertheless, philosophers of psychiatry continue to reflect on how\nthe growing appreciation of cultural diversity should inform issues in\nthe conceptual foundations of the field (Washington 2016; Radden 2019;\nMurphy ;2010 [2020]; also see Adriaens & De Block 2011). Some have\naddressed questions about whether psychopathologies and categories of\nmental disorder are best understood as natural kinds, or whether some\nalternative\u2014socially-constructed kinds, pragmatic kinds,\nconventional kinds, interactive kinds, normative kinds\u2014provides\na better model (Tsou 2007; Cooper 2004, 2007; Khalidi 2010; Kendler,\nZachar, & Craver 2011; Tekin 2016; Stegenga 2018). Given the\nsubject matter, these debates have immediate practical and ethical\nimplications as well. For example, according to proponents of the\nnormative model, a culture\u2019s conception and categories of mental\ndisorder are mainly a reflection of what it values rather than any\nobjective mental or physiological facts. This would raise familiar\nchallenges concerning relativism and disagreements about mental\ndisorder between cultures: behaviors and states of mind that are\nunusual (or even normal) but considered normatively acceptable in one\nculture may be pathologized in another, and there would be no further\nfact of the matter that would make correct or incorrect either way of\nseparating genuinely pathological and disordered behavior from\nbehavior that is merely unusual or socially unacceptable behavior\n(Feit 2020; but see Wakefield 2006). Others have explored different\nethical aspects of psychiatric diversity and cognitive dysfunction.\nFor example, the widespread exportation of Western practice and\nthought about mental illness to the rest of the world may have\nresulted in a global transformation of human mental life (Watters\n2010), leading some philosophers to call for a postcolonial psychiatry\n(Kamens 2020).\n",
