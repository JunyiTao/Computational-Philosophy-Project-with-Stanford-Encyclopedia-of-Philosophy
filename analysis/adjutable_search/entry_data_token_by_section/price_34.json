    "main_text": "Belief || Price\u2019s Dispositional Analysis of Belief\n6.4 Price\u2019s Dispositional Analysis of Belief\n\nMost generally, Price\u2019s (1969: 243\u2013266, Series II, Lecture\n1) dispositional analysis equates having a belief with the presence of\na disposition. He thinks that it is obvious that many\nbelief-ascriptions have a dispositional meaning. When we say of a\nsleeping person that she believes Rome was founded in 753 BC that does\nnot ascribe any sort of occurrence or act. Occurrence theorists do not\ndeny this, but claim that some belief-ascriptions ascribe occurrences,\nand that with dispositional ascriptions the outputs of the disposition\nare such occurrences; so the occurrence sense is more basic than the\ndispositional sense. Price\u2019s sort of dispositional analysis has\nthe following features.\n\nFirst, disposition-ascriptions are equivalent to conditionals, and\nalso can apply to a thing for a time, possibly very short, but\npossibly throughout the object\u2019s existence.\n\nSecond, to pin down belief in terms of its characteristic outputs one\nshould not focus simply on action-outcomes. Characteristically,\nbeliefs can give rise to inaction, as when your belief that the radio\nis properly tuned means you leave doing anything about it. More\ninterestingly, beliefs give rise to emotions or feelings (1969:\n267ff). Your belief that there is a snake present generates fear, and\na belief that suddenly seems to be false generates surprise (1969:\n275ff).\n\nThird, Price (1969: 280\u2013285) defends the idea (against Kneale)\nthat certain states of belief are ones in which something is felt.\n\n\nFourth, beliefs give rise to other beliefs. As he puts it: \u201cWe\nneed beliefs because we need guidance not only in our actions but in\nour thoughts also\u201d (1969: 291). Sometimes this generation of\nbelief amounts to an experienced inference, in which case the subject\nmaking the inference must assent to the premises and also to the\nconclusion, occurrences which Price calls \u201cinward and\nprivate\u201d mental acts (1969: 295), but sometimes the inference is\nautomatic and not \u201clived through\u201d (1969: 293).\n\nPrice, thus, recommends that belief is recognised as a multiform\ndisposition (1969: 294\u2013296), in which inner acts of assent\nfigure amongst the outputs of the disposition. This view inclusively\nincorporates what he sees as the insights of the traditional\noccurrence analysis and the dispositional approach. Price aims, as is\ntypical of him, to bring out the best, as he sees it, in both sides.\nWhat he brings out most is that much needs to be done to fill out the\ndispositional analysis. (Salmon 1986: 168 compares Price\u2019s\ndispositional view of belief with his own.)\n",
