    "main_text": "Criticisms of Associationism || Word Learning\n9.3 Word Learning\nMultiple issues in the acquisition of the lexicon appear to cause\nproblems for associationism. Some of the most well known examples are\nreviewed below (for further discussion of word learning and\nassociationism see Bloom 2000).\n9.3.1 Fast Mapping\nChildren learn words at an incredible rate, acquiring around 6,000\nwords by age 6 (Carey 2010: 184). If gradual learning is the rule,\nthen words too should be learned gradually across this time. However,\nthis does not appear to be the case. Susan Carey\ndiscovered the phenomenon of \u201cfast mapping\u201d, which is\none-shot learning of a word (Carey 1978a, 1978b; Carey and Bartlett\n1978). Her most influential example investigated children\u2019s\nacquisition of \u201cchromium\u201d (a color word referring to olive\ngreen). Children were shown one of two otherwise identical objects,\nwhich only differed in color and asked, \u201cCan you get me the\nchromium tray, not the red one, the chromium one\u201d (recited in\nCarey 2010: 2). All of the children handed over the correct tray at\nthat time. When the children were later tested in differing contexts,\nmore than half remembered the referent of\n\u201cchromium\u201d. These findings have been extended\u2014for\nexample, Markson and Bloom (1997) showed that they are not specific to\nthe remembering of novel words, but also hold for novel facts.\nFast mapping poses two problems for associationism. The first is\nthat the learning of a new word did not develop slowly, as would be\npredicted by proponents of gradual learning. The second is that in\norder for the word learning to proceed, the mind must have been aided\nby additional principles not given by the environment. Some of these\nprinciples such as Markman\u2019s (1989) taxonomic, whole object, and\nmutual exclusivity constraints, and Gleitman\u2019s syntactic\nbootstrapping (Gleitman et al. 2005), imply that the mind does add structure to what is\nlearned. Consequently, the associationist claim that learning is just\nmapping external contingencies without adding structure is\nimperiled.\n9.3.2 Syntactic Category Learning\n\u201cMotherese\u201d, the name of the type of language that\ninfants generally hear, consists of simple sentences such as\n\u201cNora want a bottle?\u201d and \u201cAre you tired?\u201d.\nThese sentences almost always contain a noun and a verb. Yet, the\ninfant\u2019s vocabulary massively over-represents nouns in the first\n100 words or so, while massively under-representing the verbs (never\nmind adjectives or adverbs, which almost never appear in the first 100\nwords infants produce; see, e.g., Goldin-Meadow, Seligman, and Gelman\n1976). Even more surprising is that the over-representation of\nnouns to verbs holds even though\nthe incidence of each word (that is, the token\nfrequency) is higher for the verbs than for the nouns in the common\nset used by mothers. (Snedeker and Gleitman 2004: 259, citing data\nfrom Sandhoffer, Smith, and Luo 2000)\n\nMoreover, children hear a preponderance of\ndeterminers (\u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d) but don\u2019t\nproduce them (Bloom 2000). These facts are not specific to English,\nbut hold cross-culturally (see, e.g., Caselli et al. 1995). The\ndisparity between the variation of the syntactic categories infants\nreceive as input and produce as output is troublesome to\nassociationism, insofar as associationism is committed to the learned\nstructures (and the behaviors that follow from them) merely\npatterning what is given in experience.\n9.4 Against the Contiguity Analysis of Associationism\nContiguity has been a central part of associationist analyses since\nthe British Empiricists. In the experimental literature, the problem\nof figuring out the parameters needed for acquiring an association due to the contiguity of its relata has sometimes\nbeen termed the problem of the \u201cWindow of Association\u201d\n(e.g., Gallistel and King 2009). Every associationist theory has to specify what temporal window two properties must instantiate in order for those properties to be associated.[32]\nA related problem for contiguity theorists is that if the domain\ngenerality of associative learning is desired, then the window needs\nto be homogenous across content domains. The late 1960s saw\npersuasive attacks on domain generality, as well as the necessity and\nsufficiency of the contiguity criterion in general.\n9.4.1 Against the Necessity of Contiguity\nResearch on \u201ctaste aversions\u201d and\n\u201cbait-shyness\u201d provided a variety of problems with\ncontiguity in the associative learning tradition of classical\nconditioning. Garcia observed that a gustatory stimulus (e.g.,\ndrinking water or eating a hot dog) but not an audiovisual stimulus (a\nlight and a sound) would naturally become associated with feeling\nnauseated. For instance, Garcia and Koelling (1966) paired an\naudiovisual stimulus (a light and a sound) with a gustatory stimulus\n(flavored water). The two stimuli were then paired with the rats\nreceiving radiation, which made the rats feel nauseated. The rats\nassociated the feeling of nausea with the water and not with the\nsound, even though the sound was contiguous with the water. Moreover,\nthe delay between ingesting the gustatory stimulus and feeling\nnauseated could be quite long, with the feeling not coming on until 12\nhours later (Roll and Smith 1972), and the organism needn\u2019t even\nbe conscious when the negative feeling arises. (For a review, see\nSeligman 1970; Garcia et al. 1974). The temporal delay shows that the\nCS (the flavored water) needn\u2019t be contiguous with the US (the\nfeeling of nausea) in order for learning to occur, thus showing that\ncontiguity isn\u2019t necessary for associative learning.\nGarcia\u2019s work also laid bare the problems with the domain\ngeneral aspect of associationism. In the above study the rat was\nprepared to associate the nausea with the gustatory stimulus, but\nwould not associate it with the audiovisual stimulus. However, if one\nchanges the US from feeling nauseated to receiving shocks in perfect\ncontiguity with the audiovisual and gustatory stimuli, then the rats\nwill associate the shocks with the audiovisual stimulus but not with\nthe gustatory stimulus. That is, rats are prepared to associate\naudiovisual stimuli with the shock but are contraprepared to associate\nthe shocks with the gustatory stimulus. Thus, learning does not seem\nto be entirely domain general (for similar content specificity\neffects in humans, see Baeyens et al.\n 1990).[33]\nLastly, \u201cThe Garcia effect\u201d has also been used to show\n problems in the learning curve (see section 9.1). \n\u201cTaste aversions\u201d are the phenomena whereby an\norganism gets sick from ingesting the stimulus and the taste (or odor,\nGarcia et al. 1974) of that stimulus gets associated with the feeling\nof sickness. As anyone who has had food poisoning can attest, this\nlearning can proceed in a one-shot fashion, and needn\u2019t have a\ngradual rise over many trials (taste aversions have also been observed\nin humans, see, e.g., Bernstein and Webster 1980; Bernsetin 1985;\nLogue et al. 1981; Rozin 1986).\n9.4.2. Against the Sufficiency of Contiguity\nKamin\u2019s famous blocking experiments (1969) showed that not\nall contiguous structures lead to classical conditioning. A rat that\nhas already learned that CS1 predicts a US, will not learn that a\nsubsequent CS2 predicts the US, if the CS2 is always paired with the\nCS1. Suppose that a rat has learned that a light predicts a shock\nbecause of the constant contiguity of the light and shock. After\nlearning this, the rat has a sound introduced which only arises in\nconjunction with the light and the shock. As long as the rat had\npreviously learned that the light predicts the shock, it will not\nlearn that the sound does (as can be seen on later trials that have\nthe sound alone). In sum, having learned that the CS1 predicts the US\nblocks the organism from learning that the CS2 predicts the\n US.[34] So even\nthough CS2 is perfectly contiguous with the US, the association\nbetween CS2 and the US remains unlearned, thus serving as a\ncounterexample to sufficiency of\n contiguity.[35]\nSimilarly Rescorla (1968) demonstrated that a CS can appear only\nwhen the US appears and yet still have the association between them be\nunlearnable. If a tone is arranged to bellow only when there are\nshocks, but there are still shocks when there are no tones (that is,\nthe CS only appears with the US, but the US sometimes appears without\nthe CS), no associative learning between the CS and the US will occur.\nInstead, subjects (in Rescorla 1968, rats) will only learn a\nconnection between the shock and the experimental\nsituation\u2014e.g., the room in which the experiment is carried\nout.\nIn large part because of the problems discussed in 9.4, many\nclassical conditioning theorists gave up the traditional\nprogram. Some, like Garcia, appeared to give up the classical\ntheoretical framework altogether (Garcia et al. 1974), others, such\nas Rescorla and Wagner, tried to usher the framework into the modern\nera (see, Rescorla and Wagner 1972; Rescorla 1988), where\nconditioning is seen as sensitive to base rates and driven by\ninformational \npick-up.[36] \nWhether this movement is interpreted as\na substantive revision of classical conditioning (Rescorla 1988;\nHeyes 2012) or a wholesale abandoning of it (Gallistel and King 2009)\nis debatable.\n9.5 Coextensionality\nThe Rescorla experiment also demonstrates another problem in\nassociative theorizing: the question of why some property is singled\nout as a CS as opposed to different, equally contemporaneously\ninstantiated properties. Put a different way, one needs a principle\nto say what the \u201csame situation\u201d amounts to in\ngeneralizations such as Thorndike\u2019s laws. For instance, if a CS\nand a US, say a tone and a shock, are perfectly paired so that they\nare either both present or both absent, the organism won\u2019t\nassociate the location it received shocks (e.g., the experimental\nsetting) with getting shocked, it will just associate the tone with\nthe shocks. But in the condition where the US occurs without the CS,\nbut the CS does not occur without the US, the organism will gain an\nassociation between the shocks and the location. However, in both\ncases the location is present on every trial.[37] In contrast to shocks,\nx-ray radiation, when used as a US, never appears to become\nassociated with location, even if they are always perfectly paired\n (Garcia et al. \n1972).[38]\nThe problem of saying which properties become associated when\nmultiple properties are coinstantiated sometimes goes by the name the\n\u201cCredit Assignment Problem\u201d (see, e.g., Gallistel and\n King 2009).[39]\nSome would argue that this problem is a symptom of a larger issue:\ntrying to use extensional criteria to specify intentional content\n(see, e.g., Fodor 2003). Associationists need a criterion to specify which\nof the coextensive properties will in fact be learned, and which\nnot.\nAn additional worry stems from the observation that sometimes the\nlack of a property being instantiated is an integral component of\nwhat is learned. To deal with the problem of missing properties,\ncontemporary associationists have introduced an important element to\nthe theory: inhibition. For example, if a US and a CS only appear\nwhen the other is absent, the organism will learn a negative\nrelationship holds between them; that is, the organism will learn\nthat the absence of the CS predicts the\n US.[40] Here\nthe CS becomes a \u201cconditioned inhibitor\u201d of the US.\nInhibition, using associations as modulators and not just activators,\nis a central part of current associationist thinking. For example, in\nconnectionist networks, inhibition is implemented by the activation\nof certain nodes inhibiting the activation of other nodes. Connection\nweights can be positive or negative, with the negative weight\nstanding in for the inhibitory strength of the association.",
