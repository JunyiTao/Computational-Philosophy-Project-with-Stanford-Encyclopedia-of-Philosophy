    "main_text": "Social Construction || The Construction of Ideas and Concepts\n2.1 The Construction of Ideas and Concepts\n\nIt is important to distinguish first the construction of ideas and the\nconstruction of\n objects[2]\n (Hacking 1999: 9\u201316). Let\u2019s start with ideas. On one\nreading, the claim that an idea or a concept is only possible within\nand due to a social context is utterly obvious. It would seem to be a\nmatter of common sense that concepts are taught to us by our parents\nthrough our language; different cultures have different concepts (that\ngo along with their different languages); and concepts evolve over\ntime as a result of historical changes, science, technological\nadvances, etc. Let\u2019s (albeit contentiously) call this the\n\u201cordinary view\u201d of concepts and ideas. Even someone who\nbelieves that our scientific concepts perfectly map\n\u201cnature\u2019s joints\u201d can allow that scientists come to\nhave the ideas and concepts they do through social-historical\nprocesses. After all, social and cultural forces (including, possibly,\nthe practices and methods of science) may help us develop concepts\nthat are apt or accurate, and beliefs that are true.\n\nWe may sometimes forget that what and how we think is affected by\nsocial forces because our experiences seem to be caused simply and\ndirectly by world itself. However, it does not take much prompting to\nrecall that our culture is largely responsible for the interpretive\ntools we bring to the world in order to understand it. Once\nwe\u2019ve noted that our experience of the world is already an\ninterpretation of it, we can begin to raise questions about the\nadequacy of our conceptual framework. Concepts help us organize\nphenomena; different concepts organize it in different ways. It is\nimportant, then, to ask: what phenomena are highlighted and what are\neclipsed by a particular framework of concepts? What assumptions\nprovide structure for the framework?\n\nFor example, our everyday framework for thinking about human beings is\nstructured by the assumptions that there are two (and only two) sexes,\nand that every human is either a male or a female. But in fact a\nsignificant percentage of humans have a mix of male and female\nanatomical features. Intersexed bodies are eclipsed in our everyday\nframework (Fausto-Sterling 2000). This should invite us to ask: Why?\nWhose interests are served, if anyone\u2019s, by the intersexed being\nignored in the dominant conceptual framework? (It can\u2019t be\nplausibly argued that sex isn\u2019t important enough to us to make\nfine-grained distinctions between bodies!) Further, once we recognize\nthe intersexed, how should we revise our conceptual framework? Should\nwe group bodies into more than two sexes, or are there reasons instead\nto complicate the definitions of male and female to include everyone\nin just two sex categories? More generally, on what basis should we\ndecide what categories to use? (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Butler 1990: Ch.\n1) What is the proper scope of application of these categories? In\nasking these questions it is important to remember that an idea or\nconceptual framework may be inadequate without being false, e.g., a\nclaim might be true and yet incomplete, misleading, unjustified,\nbiased, etc. (Anderson 1995).\n\nSaying that this or that idea is socially constructed may just be an\ninvitation to recall the ordinary view of concepts and note the\nmotivations behind and limitations of our current framework. Every\nframework will have some limits; the issue is whether the limits\neclipse something that, given the (legitimate) goals of our inquiry,\nmatters. However, sometimes a social constructionist is making a more\ncontroversial claim. The suggestion would be that something or other\nis \u201cmerely\u201d a social construction, in other words, that\nwhat we are taking to be real is only a fiction, an idea that fails to\ncapture reality. Feminists have argued, for example, that certain\nmental \u201cdisorders\u201d that have been used to diagnose\nbattered women are merely social constructions. Andrea Westlund points\nout how\n\n\n[b]attered women\u2019s \u201cabnormalities\u201d have been\ndescribed and redescribed within the psychiatric literature of the\ntwentieth century, characterized as everything from hysteria to\nmasochistic or self-defeating personality disorders (SDPD) to\ncodependency (Herman 1992, 116\u2013118; Tavris 1992,\n170\u2013207). Moreover, such pathologies measure, classify, and\ndefine battered women\u2019s deviance not just from\n\u201cnormal\u201d female behavior but also from universalized male\nnorms of independence and self-interest. (Westlund 1999,\n1050\u20131) \n\n\nSuch diagnoses invite us to explain domestic violence by reference to\nthe woman\u2019s psychological state rather than the batterer\u2019s\nneed for power and control; they also \u201cdeflect attention from\nthe social and political aspects of domestic violence to the private\nneuroses to which women as a group are thought to be prone\u201d\n(Westlund 1999: 1051). Westlund and others have argued that although\nvictims of domestic violence often do suffer from psychological\nconditions, e.g., major depression, there is a range of gender coded\nmental disorders included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorder (DSM) for which there is little, if any, good\nevidence. These diagnoses, it could be claimed, are merely social\nconstructions in the sense that they are ideas used to interpret and\nregulate social phenomena, but do not describe anything real. Applying\nthis to the case at hand would entail that \u201cSelf-Defeating\nPersonality Disorder\u201d doesn\u2019t really exist. The\ndescription of SDPD does not capture a mental disorder of the sort\n alleged.[3]\n\nSo in considering the claim that something is socially constructed, we\nshould ask first: Is it an object or an idea? If it is an idea, then\nwe should raise a series of epistemological questions, e.g., are we\njustified in employing this idea as we do, and metaphysical questions,\ne.g., is there anything real corresponding to the idea, or is it a\nfiction? Social constructionists often begin by noticing that an idea\nis functioning socially to support an unjust institution and then\nconsider how that idea functions within a broader framework of ideas\nand concepts to structure our experience: does it illegitimately or\ninappropriately privilege one set of phenomena over another? Does it\nobscure some phenomena completely? Does it create an illusion of\ncertain kinds of things?\n\nOf course in some contexts privileging certain phenomena is useful and\neven necessary: medical sciences are not \u201cneutral\u201d with\nrespect to what phenomena count as significant and how they are\ncategorized; medicine has a legitimate concern with human health and\nthe organisms that affect human health. However, other things being\nequal, medicine that privileges phenomena related to men\u2019s\nhealth or the health of the wealthy would not be epistemically or\npolitically legitimate (Anderson 1995). Considering what is left out\nof a framework of categories, or what assumptions structure it can\nalso reveal biases of many sorts.\n\nIn some cases of social construction what\u2019s at issue is the\naptness of the classification, in other cases it is whether the\nclassification captures a natural kind or a social kind. In yet\nfurther cases, the point is to reveal that classification does not\ndescribe anything real at all and, instead, is just a fiction being\ntreated as real. In such cases, substantial work must be done to\ndemonstrate that the idea in question is only a fiction. But\nthat\u2019s not all, for we should also ask: How are such distortions\nand fictions established and maintained? Whose interests do they\nserve?\n",
