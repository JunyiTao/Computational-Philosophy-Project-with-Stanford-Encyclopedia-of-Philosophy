    "preamble": "\n\nSusan Stebbing was a leading figure in British philosophy between the\nFirst and Second World Wars. She made significant contributions to the\ndevelopment of the analytic tradition, both in establishing it\ninstitutionally and in showing how its ideas and techniques could be\napplied in a wide range of domains. Her early work focused on logic\nand during her lifetime she was celebrated chiefly for A Modern\nIntroduction to Logic (1930), which offered an account of both\ntraditional, Aristotelian logic and the new mathematical logic\nassociated particularly with the work of Russell and Whitehead. She\nwent on to be both an important proponent of what came to be known as\nthe Cambridge School of Analysis and an advocate of the relevance of\nlogic to everyday questions and problems. In her early work on logic\nand increasingly in her later work on thinking and reasoning, she\nstressed the ways in which language is used and misused in ordinary\ncommunication and argued that philosophers must pay heed to these uses\nand misuses. Stebbing felt increasingly compelled to engage with\npractical contemporary issues and to address a wider public audience.\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937) and Thinking to Some\nPurpose (1939) offer, respectively, critiques of the language\nused in popular science communication and in everyday genres such as\npolitical speeches, advertisements, and newspaper editorials. Towards\nthe end of her life, her interests in logic and language became\nincreasingly socially directed and politically engaged.\nStebbing\u2019s work foreshadowed a number of important subsequent\ndevelopments both in philosophy itself and in linguistics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nStebbing lived through some remarkably turbulent decades, in terms\nboth of social and political upheavals and of philosophical\ndevelopments, and these are reflected in the direction and development\nof her work. Her personal life and career, in contrast, were\nrelatively uneventful. She was born in 1885 in North London, the\nyoungest of six surviving children of a fish merchant. She went up to\nGirton College Cambridge in 1904, a time at which University study for\nwomen was very much the exception and long before Cambridge awarded\ndegrees or even full University membership to women. Apparently her\nfirst interest was to study science, but this was deemed by her family\nto be too demanding for her on the grounds of her delicate health, so\nshe matriculated in History. Whether or not it was a legitimate bar to\nscientific study, it is true that Stebbing suffered from ill health\nthroughout her life. In particular, she was afflicted with\nMeni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, a disorder of the inner ear which\ncaused her fits of vertigo, severe headaches, and forced prolonged\nperiods of bed rest.\n\nWhile at Cambridge Stebbing developed an interest in philosophy,\napparently after happening on a copy of F. H. Bradley\u2019s\nAppearance and Reality (1893). After completing her studies\nin History she took the first part of the Moral Sciences Tripos at\nCambridge and then moved to King\u2019s College London to take an MA\nin Moral Science, graduating in 1912. After various short-term and\npart-time posts teaching in schools and universities, she was\nappointed to a lectureship at Bedford College for women, in the\nUniversity of London, in 1920. In 1933 she made the national\nnewspapers when she became the first woman in the UK to be appointed\nto a full professorship in philosophy, again at Bedford College.\n(Bedford College became coeducational in the 1960s but was merged with\nRoyal Holloway College in 1985, though the philosophers there moved to\nKing\u2019s College London, which now has an established chair of\nphilosophy named after her.) During the late 1930s and early 1940s she\nknew, or worked or corresponded with, many of the major figures in\nmid-twentieth century philosophy. At the same time she devoted a great\ndeal of time, influence, and personal income, to securing the safety\nof refugees from Germany and Nazi occupied countries: both exiled\nscholars and orphaned or fugitive children. However, her health\ncontinued to deteriorate. She suffered and apparently recovered from\none bout of cancer, but the cancer returned, and she died in 1943 at\nthe age of 57.\n\nStebbing\u2019s given names were \u201cLizzie Susan\u201d. She\ndisliked the \u201cLizzie\u201d and was universally known throughout\nher life as \u201cSusan\u201d. In her writing and professional work,\nshe generally preferred to use just initials, and at least to begin\nwith, she published as \u201cL. S. Stebbing\u201d. One friend\nsuggested that Stebbing preferred philosophical debates not to become\nside-tracked by details of gender or status that might be indicated by\nfirst names or titles. (For a full account of her life, see Chapman\n2013.)\n2. Logic\n\nStebbing\u2019s first significant work, which established her\nreputation, was A Modern Introduction to Logic. First\npublished in 1930, it was revised in 1933, and might justly be\nregarded as the first textbook of analytic philosophy: it went through\nseveral editions and was still being reprinted in the early 1960s. Its\nmain aim was to introduce readers to the developments in logic that\nhad taken place over the previous five decades, though she leads into\nthis through discussion of traditional Aristotelian logic. Its title\nwas \u201cA Modern Introduction to Logic\u201d, not \u201cAn\nIntroduction to Modern Logic\u201d. Divided into three parts, the\nfirst deals with topics that are now familiar in analytic philosophy,\nsuch as names and descriptions, logical form, the theory of\ndescriptions, inference and implication, as well as offering an\naccount of syllogistic theory. The second deals with scientific\nmethodology, covering induction and causality, in particular. The\nthird discusses definition, abstraction, and the nature and historical\ndevelopment of logic.\n\nStebbing\u2019s conception of logic is made clear in the first and\nlast two chapters of the book. Logical thinking is\n\u201cdirected\u201d thinking, aimed at answering a question or\nsolving a problem. As such it involves reasoning: identifying\nand articulating the premises by means of which, by valid\nargumentation, to arrive at relevant conclusions. Reasoning proceeds\nin accord with certain rules and exhibits certain forms of inference,\nand one of the tasks of logical theory is to articulate these rules\nand make explicit these forms of inference\u2014as Aristotle first\ndid in developing his theory of the syllogism. One reason that\nStebbing included discussion of syllogistic theory was that the rules\nand forms are relatively simple, so that the dependence of the\nvalidity of an inference on its logical form, for example, could be\nmore easily ascertained and elucidated. But she was also concerned to\nintroduce modern logic. She explains the basic symbolism of Whitehead\nand Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica in chapter 8, for\nexample, and the theory of relations in chapter 10. She does not give\nany systematic presentation of the predicate calculus, however. In\nkeeping with her conception of directed thinking, her concern is\nprimarily with explaining the various concepts and doctrines, such as\nthe concept of a proposition and Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions, which help us in understanding logical thinking and\nlogical theory.\n\nLogic, according to Stebbing, is not an art, understood as \u201ca\nset of rules the learning of which may fit some one to do\nsomething\u201d, but a science\u2014the science of possible forms\n(1933b: 473\u20134). Insofar as the logical forms that the science of\nlogic discovers are norms of thinking, logic can be described\nas a normative science. But its normativity is not its distinguishing\nfeature, she argues, but is merely a by-product of the fact that norms\nare what are discovered in logic. She offers an account of the\ndevelopment of logic as the science of form in the final chapter of\nthe book, tracing it from its roots in Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics to Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica, in which it is finally shown, she claims, that\n\u201cDemonstration as such is purely formal\u201d (1933b: 488).\n\nIn 1934 Stebbing published Logic in Practice, a very short\nbook directed at a more general audience. She continues to regard\nlogic as the science of forms, the chief task of which is to make\nexplicit the norms of reasoning. But she does indeed become more\ninterested in the art of thinking. In the preface she writes:\n\n\nThe study of logic does not in itself suffice to enable us to reason\ncorrectly, still less to think clearly where our passionate beliefs\nare concerned. Thinking is an activity of the whole personality.\nGiven, however, a desire to be reasonable, then a knowledge of the\nconditions to which all sound thinking must conform will enable us to\navoid certain mistakes into which we are prone to fall. There is such\na thing as a habit of sound reasoning. This habit may be acquired by\nconsciously attending to the logical principles of sound reasoning, in\norder to apply them to test the soundness of particular arguments.\n(1934a: vii\u2013viii)\n\n\nLogic in Practice is intended to help people reason\ncorrectly, with stress laid on \u201cthe importance of considering\nlanguage, which is an instrument of our thinking and is imperfect, as\nare all human creations\u201d (1934a: viii). This marks a transition\nin Stebbing\u2019s work: from the mid 1930s onwards she becomes more\nconcerned with what would now be described as critical thinking.\n3. Cambridge Analysis\n\nBy her own account, Stebbing was \u201cconverted\u201d to analytic\nphilosophy when she encountered G. E. Moore for the first time at a\nmeeting in London:\n\n\nIn 1917 I read a paper to the Aristotelian Society [entitled\n\u201cRelation and Coherence\u201d], perhaps one of the most muddled\npapers that have ever been presented to that assembly. \u2026 At the\noutset of the discussion \u2026 a man whom I had never seen and took\nto be quite young, began to ask me questions with a vehement\ninsistence that considerably alarmed me. \u201cWhat ON EARTH do you\nmean by that?\u201d he exclaimed again and again, thumping the table\nas he said \u201con earth\u201d in a manner that clearly shewed he\nbelieved there was no earthly meaning in what I had said. Soon,\nhowever, my alarm faded; the vehement philosopher had made me forget\nnot to be a philosopher\u2014nothing mattered except trying to find\nout what I did mean. In spite of my stumbling replies he managed to\nelicit the reasons why I had been led to the views I was trying to\ndefend; he shewed me the baselessness of many of my reasons, he\nunravelled the muddles and enabled me to see more clearly the grain of\nsense that had been at the back of my inept criticisms. That was my\nfirst meeting with Moore, whose name I discovered only towards the end\nof the discussion. I am inclined to think that this meeting of the\nAristotelian Society was somewhat peculiar in the annals of the\nSociety, for the reader of a paper was, before the end of the\ndiscussion, convinced that her main contentions were entirely wrong.\nOne does not expect a philosophical society\u2019s meeting to end in\na conversion, yet such was the result in my case, owing mainly to the\nvehement and vigorous clarity of Moore and his patience in pursuing\nthe question to its end \u2026 (1942: 530)\n\n\nStebbing kept in touch with Moore for the rest of her life,\ncorresponding and meeting regularly in Cambridge. Chapter IX of A\nModern Introduction to Logic, for example, was revised for the\nsecond edition in the light of criticisms she received from Moore, as\nshe notes in its preface (1933b: vii).\n\nOne fundamental idea that Stebbing took over from Moore was the\ndistinction between understanding a proposition and knowing its\nanalysis. Moore had appealed to this distinction in arguing in\n\u201cA Defence of Common Sense\u201d (1925), for example, that one\ncan know, with certainty, that various \u201ccommon sense\u201d\npropositions, such as that one exists, has a body, is a human being,\nand so on, are true even if one cannot give the analysis of them. All\nthat is necessary to know that these propositions are true is to\nunderstand them (understand their meaning, as Moore put it). Indeed,\nMoore argued, one could not even raise the question of its correct\nanalysis (or judge the correctness of any analysis that was offered)\nif one did not understand the proposition in the first place. This\ndistinction is also fundamental to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus, though whether it was Wittgenstein who influenced\nMoore or Moore (in earlier thinking) who influenced Wittgenstein\ncannot be discussed here. Whatever their mutual influence, however,\nthe distinction became central to the conception of analysis that was\ncharacteristic of what came to be known as the Cambridge School of\nAnalysis, whose members included John Wisdom and Austin Duncan-Jones\nas well as Moore and Stebbing. It also included, or at least was\ninfluenced by the ideas of, Bertrand Russell, Frank P. Ramsey and C.\nD. Broad. (For further details, see Baldwin 2013.)\n\nIn 1932 Stebbing read another paper to the Aristotelian Society\nentitled \u201cThe Method of Analysis in Metaphysics\u201d, in which\nshe sought to spell out and justify the presuppositions of the\nconception of analysis of the Cambridge School. She identifies three\nmain assumptions, which she formulates as follows (1932: 85):\n\n(1)\nIf p [standing for any proposition] is to be analysed,\nthen p must be understood. It follows that there is at least\none expression which unambiguously expresses p.\n(2)\nIf p is to be analysed, then it is not always the case\nthat p is known to be false, and it is sometimes the case\nthat p is known to be true. \n(3)\nDirectional analysis is possible. \n\n\nThe first, which she characterizes as logical, she defends by\nappealing to Moore\u2019s distinction between understanding a\nproposition and knowing its analysis, making explicit the\npresupposition that if one can understand a proposition, then there\nmust be some unambiguous formulation of it. The second, which she\ndescribes as metaphysical (though it is also epistemological),\nexpresses the further\u2014Moorean\u2014assumption that any process\nof analysis must take it as granted that the proposition we are\nseeking to analyse can be known to be true. Stebbing here merely\nstates that the assumption is plausible and that she has no reasons to\nreject it (1932: 92).\n\nThe third assumption gives her the most difficulty, however. She\ndivides it into a number of more specific presuppositions, but what is\ncrucial is the assumption that analysis must be \u201cdirected\u201d\ntowards, i.e., end in, what she calls \u201cbasic\nfacts\u201d\u2014absolutely simple or atomic facts. Just such an\nassumption was made in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus as well\nas in Russell\u2019s form of logical atomism, for example. But once\nStebbing has made explicit all these presuppositions, she comes to the\nconclusion that not only are they unjustified but they are not even\nvery plausible (1932: 86\u20137).\n\nTo illustrate the conception of metaphysical analysis that Stebbing is\nseeking to articulate, let us consider one of Stebbing\u2019s\nexamples:\n\n(1)\n Every economist is fallible.\n\n\nLet us suppose that we need to give some unambiguous formulation of\nthis. Here is one possibility:\n\n(2)\nFor all x,if x is an economist, then x is fallible.\n\n\nWe can see this as providing a logical analysis of (1). It could be\nreadily formalized in the predicate calculus as \n\n\\[ (\\forall x) (Ex \\rightarrow Fx) \\]\n\n\nBut what is its metaphysical analysis? One suggestion might be that\nthe analysis of (1) ends in a conjunction of propositions expressing\nthe specific facts about the fallibility of each economist:\n\n(3)\nKarl Marx is fallible and John Maynard Keynes is fallible and\nMuhammad Yunus is fallible and \u2026 \n\n\nIt seems clear that we can understand (1) without knowing the\nsuggested analysis expressed in (3), so to this extent the Moorean\ndistinction seems justified. To understand (3), taken as elliptical\nfor the full conjunction, I would need to know the names of all the\neconomists, and this is something that very few\u2014if any\u2014of\nus know. But if this is right, then can we really say that (3)\nanalyses the \u201cmeaning\u201d of (1), which is how Moore seemed\nto want to put it? Does (1) have the same \u201cmeaning\u201d as\n(3)? Even if we take (1) as an abbreviation of the (full) conjunction\nexpressed in (3), would we not at the very least have to add at the\nend \u201cand that is all the economists there are\u201d? And how\nshould this last clause be analysed? What kind of fact does that\nexpress? In any case, can \u201cfacts\u201d such as that Keynes is\nfallible, etc., be regarded as \u201cbasic\u201d? Can they not be\nanalysed further? (3) was only offered as one suggestion, natural as\nit might have seemed. Are there not other possible analyses, taking a\nrather different form? Might the truth (if such it is) of (1) not be\ngrounded, instead, in facts about the nature of being an\neconomist\u2014that economists have to idealize situations and hence\nare bound to get some things wrong, for example?\n\nThere is room for argument, then, as to what the\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d analysis of a proposition such as (1) is;\nand in the early 1930s members of the Cambridge School did indeed\ndebate the issue of the analysis of a whole range of types of\nproposition in great detail. Stebbing was at the centre of this\ndebate. A distinction came to be drawn between logical and\nmetaphysical analysis in just the way we have outlined: logical\nanalysis was intended to give an \u201cunambiguous\u201d formulation\nand metaphysical analysis was intended to uncover the \u201cbasic\nfacts\u201d on which the meaning or truth of the proposition to be\nanalysed was grounded. Logical analysis was alternatively described as\n\u201csame-level\u201d analysis and metaphysical analysis as\n\u201cnew-level\u201d or \u201creductive\u201d or\n\u201cdirectional\u201d analysis.\n\nOnce this distinction is drawn, it becomes possible to reject\nmetaphysical analysis without rejecting analysis altogether. We can\nallow logical analysis to provide us with\n\u201cunambiguous\u201d\u2014or at least clearer\u2014formulations\nof the proposition we want to analyse. This may be sufficient to\nelucidate its logical form or to remove certain confusions to which it\nmay give rise. This is what Max Black (1933), for example, advocated\nin a reply to Stebbing that he also read to the Aristotelian Society a\nfew months later (see Beaney 2003). We can also allow\n\u201cpartial\u201d metaphysical analyses. We might\n\u201creduce\u201d propositions about the decisions of committees,\nfor example, to propositions about the activities of its constituent\nmembers, which may be enough to explain the decisions that were made\nwithout having to further analyse what it is to be a member of a\ncommittee or indeed what it is to be a person (rational or otherwise).\nThe correctness or usefulness of an analysis is relative to our\npurposes in seeking it. This purpose-relative approach to analysis was\nthe one that Stebbing herself came to adopt. (For more on the debates\nabout analysis in the 1930s, see Baldwin 2013; Beaney 2003, 2016.)\n4. Logical Positivism\n\nStebbing played a major role in introducing logical positivism into\nBritain. She first met Moritz Schlick in Oxford in 1930 when they\nspoke in a panel together at the Seventh International Congress of\nPhilosophy, and Schlick came to England again in 1932 to lecture at\nKing\u2019s College London. In 1934 she invited Rudolf Carnap to give\na series of three lectures (later published as Philosophy and\nLogical Syntax) in London, where Carnap met Russell and A. J.\nAyer for the first time. She was on the organization committee for the\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science, which was held in\nParis in 1935 and in Cambridge in 1938.\n\nWhat Stebbing found attractive in logical positivism was its respect\nfor science and the value it placed on logic. What she rejected was\nits repudiation of metaphysics. (She endorsed the\n\u201clogical\u201d and \u201cempiricism\u201d but not the\n\u201cpositivism\u201d, in other words, of the movement for which\nboth \u201clogical empiricism\u201d and \u201clogical\npositivism\u201d are used as names, more or less interchangeably.) We\ncan see her 1932 paper, \u201cThe Method of Analysis in\nMetaphysics\u201d, as seeking to defend the conception of\nmetaphysical analysis of the Cambridge School in response to the\nlogical positivists\u2019 critique of metaphysics. But it is in a\npaper she read to the British Academy in March 1933, \u201cLogical\nPositivism and Analysis\u201d, that she attempts to engage directly\nwith logical positivism and say what she finds objectionable about it.\nShe takes \u201clogical positivism\u201d to include the views of\nWittgenstein, as filtered through the reports and writings of various\nmembers of the Vienna Circle such as Schlick, Carnap, and Friedrich\nWaismann. Focusing especially on Carnap, she criticizes his conception\nof \u201clogically constructed systems\u201d (as found in his\nAufbau of 1928, for example) for being too abstract. However\nuseful such a system may be in showing what can be constructed with\nthe fewest possible assumptions and primitive terms, she argues, the\nworld itself is not such a system. She also attacks Carnap\u2019s\n\u201cmethodological solipsism\u201d on what she calls \u201cthe\nbest of grounds \u2026 namely, that I know it to be\nfalse\u201d (1933a: 77).\n\nStebbing\u2019s assertion of what she knows is hardly likely\nto be seen by anyone other than a committed Moorean as a knockdown\nargument against any form of solipsism. She goes on to accuse\nWittgenstein, and the logical positivists who were influenced by him,\nof confusing \u201cdirect experience\u201d and\n\u201ccontent\u201d, but no evidence is offered for saddling\nWittgenstein with the views she claims he had. However, in the last\nquarter of the paper, she makes clear that what is really at issue, in\nher view, is a conflict between two different conceptions of analysis,\nwhich she calls \u201cdirectional analysis\u201d and\n\u201cpostulational analysis\u201d. Directional analysis is the form\nof analysis that she had attempted to defend in her 1932 paper.\nPostulational analysis is what is used \u201cin the construction of a\ndeductive system\u201d (1933a: 80). Axioms are stipulated and\neverything else in the system is derived by the rules of\ninference.\n\nWhat Stebbing means by a constructed system here is a system that is\npostulated as a replacement for a conceptual system used in\nour everyday life\u2014in the way that set theory might be seen as\npostulating a replacement for our ordinary system of arithmetic. On\nthis view, our everyday concepts and propositions are vague and need\nto be replaced\u2014or \u201cexplicated\u201d, to use\nCarnap\u2019s later term\u2014by precisely defined concepts, clearly\nstated axioms and logically derived propositions. Stebbing\u2019s\nfundamental objection to this conception of postulational or\nexplicatory analysis is that it misunderstands the role of analysis,\nwhich is \u201cto understand something more clearly\u201d (1933a:\n81). Simply replacing our ordinary vague concepts by precise ones does\nnot genuinely show what it was we understood. Consider, for example,\nthe \u201creplacement\u201d of our ordinary concepts of colour by\nconcepts scientifically defined in terms of the wavelengths of light,\netc. Arguably, this can never do justice to what it is we experience\nwhen we see colours and describe them in the ordinary ways we do: it\ndoes not capture the phenomenology of our experience. In the same way,\nwe might question whether defining numbers as sets genuinely shows\nwhat we \u201creally mean\u201d by number terms.\n\nAccording to Stebbing, the logical positivists\u2014and she\nspecifically mentions Schlick in this regard\u2014put \u201cthe\npursuit of meaning\u201d before the determination of the truth-value\nof propositions (1933a: 83). But this gets things precisely the wrong\nway around, on Stebbing\u2019s Moorean view: we begin with\npropositions that we understand (in some sense) and can know\nto be true, and in seeking an analysis of these propositions, we aim\nto clarify that understanding by identifying the facts that make them\ntrue or false. This is precisely the conception of analysis that she\nhad attempted to articulate and defend in her 1932 paper. On the\nexplicatory conception (as Stebbing seems to construe it), on the\nother hand, we postulate something with a meaning that is\nintended to be clear once and for all, with the aim of thereby guiding\nor constraining our subsequent determinations of the truth-value of\nthe relevant propositions.\n\nAt the very end of her lecture, in explaining how she disagrees with\nthe \u201clinguistic\u201d approach of Wittgenstein and the logical\npositivists, Stebbing summarises her view as follows:\n\n\nWhat we ordinarily say, we say unclearly. We speak unclearly because\nwe think unclearly. It is the task of philosophy to render our\nthoughts clear. \u2026 We cannot clarify our thoughts by thinking\nabout thinking, nor by thinking about logic. We have to think\nabout what we were thinking about. The philosopher\nconsiders a given expression, and analyses it in order to\nfind another expression which says more clearly what\nthe original expression said less clearly. This investigation\nis not linguistic. We must first know what facts are the case\nbefore we can fruitfully employ analysis for the purpose of clarifying\nour thoughts about the world. Accordingly, Logical Positivism fails, I\nthink, in so far as it attempts to start from a priori\nassumptions with regard to the nature of language and the principles\nof symbolism, and, by means of these, to draw limits with regard to\nwhat we can think. Their mistake is that they seek to make\neverything clear at once. But it is not in this way that\nphilosophy can develop. We must proceed step by step, beginning with\npropositions which we know to be true, not ruling out\ninitially what does not fit in. (1933a: 86)\n\n\nWhat emerges from the two papers that Stebbing wrote on analysis in\n1932 and 1933? As she admitted herself, some of her arguments might\nwell seem unconvincing or inconclusive. On the one hand, she confesses\nthat she can find no justification for the presuppositions of\ndirectional analysis, her favoured form of analysis, at least as far\nas the commitment to \u201cbasic facts\u201d is concerned. On the\nother hand, her objection to postulational analysis seems to amount,\nat times, to no more than the charge that it is not directional\nanalysis. (For a fuller account of her critique of logical positivism,\nsee Beaney 2016.) In attempting to clarify both directional analysis\nand postulational analysis, and to defend the former and criticise the\nlatter, however, she helped sharpen the issues in dispute between the\nCambridge School and logical positivism. Furthermore, by encouraging\ndialogue between the two, in both her writings and her organizational\nactivities, she also helped foster that critical engagement between\nthe \u201cordinary language\u201d and \u201cideal language\u201d\nwings of analytic philosophy, as they later came to be called, which\nhas continued to this day. In short, what she promoted, above all, was\ncritical reflection on the nature of analysis and hence of the\nessential characteristics of the two main schools of thought that were\nto come together under the heading of \u201canalytic\nphilosophy\u201d.\n5. Politics and Critical Thinking\n\nDuring the mid 1930s, Stebbing engaged increasingly with a general or\neven popular, as opposed to an exclusively philosophical or academic,\naudience. This development in her work was driven by her belief that\nthe structures and principles of formal logic need not be seen as a\nclosed, isolated system, but rather could profitably be applied to the\nproblems and issues of modern life. This was coupled with a commitment\nto the practical analysis of the texts in which these problems were\npresented and discussed, in order to identify any illogical, flawed or\nmisleading thinking. In Logic in Practice (1934) she had\nalready aimed at a more general readership, including more overt\npolitical commentary than in A Modern Introduction to Logic,\noffering examples drawn from political speeches and newspaper reports\nto demonstrate examples of muddled argument and biased description. In\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937), her focus was on the\nlanguage used by scientists to explain their ideas\u2014particularly\nby scientists who proposed to present these ideas in a way that was\npalatable, and indeed entertaining, to a popular audience. Stebbing\nworried that imprecise, impressionistic or sensational uses of\nlanguage obscured the nature of recent scientific advances and, worse\nstill, encouraged unjustified inferences and beliefs to be drawn from\nthem.\n\nOne of Stebbing\u2019s main targets was Sir Arthur Eddington, a then\nprominent public figure whose photographs of the eclipse in 1919 had\nhelped to confirm Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Eddington\nliked to grip his readers\u2019 attention and their imagination by\nrequiring them to consider everyday experiences in the light of\nscientific discoveries. In this passage from his popular book The\nNature of the Physical World (1935), he is concerned with the\natomic theory of matter:\n\n\nI am standing on the threshold about to enter a room. It is a\ncomplicated business. In the first place I must shove against an\natmosphere pressing with a force of fourteen pounds on every square\ninch of my body. I must make sure of landing on a plank traveling at\ntwenty miles a second round the sun\u2014a fraction of a second too\nearly or too late, the plank would be miles away. I must do this\nwhilst hanging from a round planet head outward into space, and with a\nwind of aether blowing at no one knows how many miles a second through\nevery interstice of my body. The plank has no solidity of substance.\nTo step on it is like stepping on a swarm of flies. Shall I not slip\nthrough? No, if I make the venture one of the flies hits me and gives\na boost up again; I fall again and am knocked upwards by another fly;\nand so on. I may hope that the net result will be that I remain about\nsteady; but if unfortunately I should slip through the floor or be\nboosted too violently up to the ceiling, the occurrence would be, not\na violation of the laws of Nature, but a rare coincidence. (1935:\n328)\n\n\nStebbing disliked this way of explaining physics, because of the\ncasual misuse it made of everyday language, and also because of the\nmuch larger implications Eddington encouraged his reader to draw from\nit. In Philosophy and the Physicists she drew attention to\nthese issues. She argued, for instance, that it simply made no sense\nto say \u201cthe plank has no solidity of substance\u201d. The word\n\u201csolid\u201d just means having properties such as those of a\nplank. Whatever developments in physics may indicate, a plank with no\nsolidity is simply a nonsense, or a contradiction. Science must find\nother language in which to express these findings, since using\neveryday language to do so will only mislead and confuse. In fact,\nalthough Eddington ignored or even concealed this fact, scientists had\nfound it necessary to develop new and highly formal systems for\nexpressing their findings, since they were describing a very different\ntype of reality from that of everyday experience. Eddington\u2019s\npersistent use of everyday language to describe scientific knowledge\nwas designed to have an emotional rather than an informative impact on\nhis readership. Here is Stebbing\u2019s own version of the business\nof walking into a room:\n\n\nI enter my study and see the blue curtains fluttering in the breeze,\nfor the windows are open. I notice a bowl of roses on the table; it\nwas not there when I went out. Clumsily I stumble against the table,\nbruising my leg against its hard edge; it is a heavy table and\nscarcely moves under the impact of my weight. I take a rose from the\nbowl, press it to my face, feel the softness of the petals, and smell\nits characteristic scent. I rejoice in the beauty of the graded\nshading of the crimson petals. In short\u2014I am in a familiar room,\nseeing, touching, smelling, familiar things, thinking familiar\nthoughts, experiencing familiar emotions. (1937: 45)\n\n\nStebbing\u2019s point is that ordinary language very adequately and\nindeed very accurately describes everyday experience. That description\ndoes not coincide with the scientific understanding of matter, and nor\nshould it; for that a different type of language is necessary. The\ndanger was that once Eddington had got his readership thinking about\nthe scientific conception of matter in relation to everyday language,\nhe was able to manipulate their understanding of the possible\nconsequences of recent scientific developments for our understanding\nof other areas of human experience, including the spiritual and even\nthe religious. Eddington argued that the behaviour of material objects\nwas now shown to be random and unpredictable, rather than controlled\nby determinate laws of physics. Our understanding of the world around\nus as relatively stable and ordered was imposed on reality by our own\nperceptions. This, in turn, opened up the possibility of the scientific\nviability of other types of truth or reality, including the mental,\nthe spiritual and, for Eddington, the divine.\n\nIf Philosophy and the Physicists was written to guard its\nreadership against imprecise or misleading use of language by\nscientists, Stebbing\u2019s next major publication had an even more\nearnest and urgent purpose. Thinking to Some Purpose was\npublished in 1939. It was a direct result of the increasing pressure\non Stebbing to become a more prominent commentator on current affairs\nand to contribute to public intellectual debate; the BBC commissioned\na series of talks from Stebbing which she was unable to deliver\nbecause of ill health but which she published instead in the newly\nestablished Penguin series of \u201coriginal non-fiction books on\ncontemporary issues\u201d. Although Stebbing was reluctant to play a\nprominent public role, she was committed to the necessity of academics\ncontributing to the discussion of crucial social and political issues.\nThinking to Some Purpose was written before the beginning of\nthe Second World War, but it was produced at a time when Stebbing,\nlike many others, was well aware of the gravity of the national and\ninternational situation, and of what was at stake. She was convinced\nthat it was imperative that the electorate, now universally franchised\nand generally literate, should be equipped to deal with the type of\nrhetoric that was being directed at them:\n\n\nthe citizens must be able to think relevantly, that is, to think to\nsome purpose. Thus to think is difficult. Accordingly, it is not\nsurprising, however saddening it may be, that many of our statesmen do\nnot trust the citizens to think, but rely instead upon the arts of\npersuasion. (1939: 14)\n\n\nThe book is full of analyses of actual uses of language by those\ntrying to persuade others to take a particular course of action:\nadvertisers, journalists, clergymen and, particularly, politicians.\nStebbing urged readers to hone their critical skills in order to\nidentify uses of language that introduce assumptions rather than make\ndirect statements, or that hide parts of an argument that in logic\nwould need to be made explicit. A repeated target is Sir Stanley\nBaldwin, several times Conservative Prime Minister. For instance,\nStebbing quoted the following extract from a speech he gave while\ncampaigning on behalf of the National Government in the 1931 General\nElection. Baldwin\u2019s task was to explain how it would be possible\nfor Liberals and Conservative to work together in Government.\n\n\nThere must undoubtedly be some difficulty over the question of\ntariffs. Liberals would approach the problem with a Free Trade bias\nbut with an open mind to examine and decide whether there were\nmeasures of dealing with the problem apart from tariffs. Conservatives\nwould start with an open mind but with a favour for tariffs. They\nwould start with an open mind to examine alternative methods, and the\nCabinet as a whole would sit down with perfect honesty and sincerity\nto come to a decision on that matter. (quoted by Stebbing 1939:\n66)\n\n\nStebbing focussed on some of Baldwin\u2019s specific lexical\nchoices:\n\n\nYou will notice that Baldwin speaks of a Liberal bias for\nFree Trade and of a Conservative favour for tariffs. The word\n\u201cbias\u201d carries with it an emotional significance of having\nprejudged the matter in a way that could hardly be regarded\nas consistent with having an \u201copen mind\u201d. The word\n\u201cfavour\u201d does not, I think, have this significance. (1939:\n66\u20137)\n\n\nIn numerous other examples in Thinking to Some Purpose,\nStebbing drew attention to the ways in which speakers and writers can\npotentially have a strong influence on the beliefs and actions of\ntheir audiences, not just through what they literally say but through\nhow their choice of words introduces ideological assumptions or\ndisguises necessary steps in an argument.\n6. Last Work and Legacy\n\nSoon after the outbreak of war, Stebbing moved to Cambridge as part of\nthe general evacuation of Bedford College. During her last years, her\nwork became increasingly socially and politically engaged, although\nshe herself continued to shun public recognition or any suggestion of\npersonal political activism. In Ideals and Illusions (1941)\nshe urged the importance in all main spheres of life of identifying\nand pursuing specific ideals, and distinguishing these from\npotentially comforting but misleading illusions. She targeted a number\nof what she saw as such dangerous illusions, including both political\nand religious illusions, such as in cases where religion was used to\ncondone or excuse social inequality or injustice. Stebbing struggled\nagainst ill health to finish A Modern Elementary Logic\n(1943), a textbook on logic that was aimed particularly at students\nwho were starting out in their philosophical studies, perhaps without\nthe benefit of philosophical instruction, as would be the case with\nthose serving in the military. Her final philosophical contribution\nwas Men and Moral Principles, delivered as a London School of\nEconomics Hobhouse Memorial Lecture a few months before she died and\npublished posthumously as a pamphlet in 1944. Stebbing defended the\nvalidity of moral discussion and the reality of moral principles,\nbased on humanistic rather than religious credentials. She argued that\nmoral judgments needed to be considered in their full context and on\nan individual basis. Her approach allowed for complete sets of ideals\nto be evaluated and compared in relation to complex real-life\nsituations, but prompted some later criticism that it left her without\nan intellectual basis for her own condemnation of a number of\npolitical systems, including Fascism.\n\nStebbing\u2019s obituaries focused largely on her logical and\nanalytical work. This work is indeed still worth celebrating in its\nown right and on its own terms, particularly in her bringing together\ntraditional and modern logic and in her accounts of the key ideas and\ndoctrines of the Cambridge School of Analysis. Her role as an early\nBritish interpreter and critic of logical positivism and the dialogue\nshe promoted between the two main branches of analytic philosophy are\nalso extremely significant.\n\nSubsequent developments in how language has been studied and discussed\nin both philosophy and linguistics, however, suggest other ways of\nevaluating Stebbing\u2019s legacy and her significance. She combined\nher commitment to formal logic with a belief in the importance of\npractical analysis of everyday texts and as a result in the necessity\nof public engagement by philosophers, in a manner which was at the\ntime rare in academia. She saw no discrepancy between the rigours of\nlogical argument and the requirements of practical problem solving,\nand stressed the need for clarity and transparency in language use. In\nthis, she championed the importance to philosophers of paying\nattention to ordinary language and the varieties of its everyday use\nsomewhat in advance of the rise of \u201cordinary language\nphilosophy\u201d in Oxford after the Second World War.\n\nIn some ways, Stebbing went even further than the most committed\nphilosophers of ordinary language such as Ryle, Austin and Strawson.\nShe did not just argue that philosophers should pay attention to\nordinary language; she illustrated her philosophical writings with a\nwealth of real life examples taken from everyday communicative\ninteractions, including newspaper editorials, political speeches and\nadvertising copy. Mary Warnock comments that Stebbing\u2019s\n\u201cdetermination to find in language both the source and sometimes\nthe solution of traditional philosophical puzzles\u201d was central\nto later developments in ordinary language philosophy, and highlights\nStebbing\u2019s early \u201cunderstanding of the philosophical\nsignificance of this approach, which can properly be described as\nrevolutionary\u201d (1996: 93). Stebbing\u2019s work was recognized\nat the time in this respect. Urmson (1953), in particular, praised her\nassault on Eddington for its insistence on attending to how people\nordinarily use language; \u201csolid\u201d is used to describe\nproperties such as those displayed by a plank of wood, so to describe\na plank as having no solidity is simply nonsensical.\n\nFurther developments in the study of language, more recent in origin\nand associated with the discipline of linguistics rather than that of\nphilosophy, have some striking resonances with Stebbing\u2019s later\nwritings, and suggest a modern re-evaluation of her contribution.\nStebbing became increasingly interested not just in the significance\nand potentialities of everyday language but also in the social and\nideological implications of how it is used in society, particularly by\nthose in authority. A number of branches of recent and present\nlinguistics share this commitment to studying language in context.\nPragmatics, which can trace a direct descent from ordinary language\nphilosophy through figures such as Austin and Grice, considers meaning\nin relation to the intentions, functions and contexts associated with\nthe use of linguistic forms. Sociolinguistics is concerned with social\ninfluences on the use of language and with the effects of language use\non society.\n\nPerhaps the strongest affinities between Stebbing\u2019s work and\ncurrent linguistics are in the area of Critical Discourse Analysis\n(CDA). CDA emerged as an identifiable branch of linguistics during the\nfinal decades of the twentieth century. Its focus is on the close\nanalysis of actual language use to reveal how specific choices made by\nspeakers and writers can introduce ideological assumptions into texts,\noften assumptions that are concealed beneath the surface message of\nthe text. Some of the methodological commitments and objectives of CDA\nare remarkably similar to the things that Stebbing was saying about\nlanguage half a century or more earlier. For instance, CDA most\ncommonly engages with examples of language use sourced from\ncontemporary newspaper articles, advertisements and political\nspeeches. It also has a specific agenda in terms of its intended\neffect, reminiscent of Stebbing\u2019s mission to educated her\nreadership as informed and responsible consumers and voters:\n\n\nCDA aims to make its users aware of, and able to describe and\ndeconstruct, vectors and effects in texts and semiotic materials\ngenerally which might otherwise remain to wield power uncritiqued. In\nthese respects CDA may be a kind of wake-up call, or\nconsciousness-raising, about the coercive or anti-democratizing\neffects of the discourses we live by (Toolan 2002: xxii).\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nStebbing played a major role in the development of analytic philosophy\nin the 1930s, writing what was in effect the first textbook of\nanalytic philosophy, A Modern Introduction to Logic (1930).\nAlthough she was a leading member of the Cambridge School of Analysis,\nwith Moore the strongest influence upon her, she also sought to engage\nwith logical positivism and thereby helped to bring the two together\ninto the wider movement that we now know as analytic philosophy. In\nher later writings she sought to show the relevance of her logical and\nanalytic work to everyday thinking and to social and political debate.\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937) and Thinking to Some\nPurpose (1939), her two most important books addressed to a more\ngeneral audience, can also be regarded as among the first books of\ncritical thinking, anticipating developments in sociolinguistics,\npragmatics and critical discourse analysis. Both her governing idea of\n\u201cpurposive thinking\u201d and the emphasis she placed on\nclarity of thought and expression were manifested in all her writing,\nwhich was also characterized\u2014as indeed, were her teaching and\norganizational activities\u2014by an exceptional degree of\nintellectual honesty and moral integrity.\n",
