    "main_text": "History || Aquinas\n1.2 Aquinas\n\nAlthough one could start earlier, Aquinas offers a picture of what\nmight be regarded as the traditional, canonical understanding of\ncoercion, its importance, and consequences. Discussion of coercion\n(sometimes also described as \u201ccompulsion\u201d) recurs in the\nSumma Theologica under several headings. In a discussion of\nnecessity and the will, he notes that when we speak of necessity, we\nmean \u201cthat which must be\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6\nA6). There are various ways something may be necessary. Coercion, he\nsays, is a kind of necessity in which the activities of one agent\n\u2014 the coercer \u2014 make something necessary for another\nagent. The \u201cnecessity of coercion\u201d is that in which\n\u201ca thing must be, when someone is forced by some agent, so that\nhe is not able to do the contrary\u201d (ibid.). Such\nnecessity is \u201caltogether repugnant to the will,\u201d\n(ibid.) meaning that what is done because of coercion is not\ndone voluntarily. To say that something is voluntary, for Aquinas,\nimplies that it follows from or is in accord with one\u2019s\ninclinations; in contrast, coercion is linked with the notions of\nviolence and the involuntary.\n\nFor we call that violent which is against the inclination of a thing.\n\u2026 [A] thing is called voluntary because it is according to the\ninclination of the will. Therefore, just as it is impossible for a\nthing to be at the same time violent and natural, so it is impossible\nfor a thing to be absolutely coerced or violent, and voluntary\n(Aquinas, ST, I Q82 A1).\n\n\nFor Aquinas, the law and the government bear a special relationship to\nthe use of coercion/compulsion. In a discussion of the nature of\n(human) law, Aquinas claims that \u201cthe notion of law contains two\nthings: first, that it is a rule of human acts; secondly, that it has\ncoercive power\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q96 A5). This power\nis identified with the ability of rulers to use force and violence\nagainst their subjects: \u201cthe governor of a city has perfect\ncoercive power: wherefore he can inflict irreparable punishments such\nas death and mutilation\u201d (Aquinas ST, II.II Q65 A2).\nThe law, Aquinas suggests, must use \u201cforce and fear\u201d in\norder to restrain those who are \u201cfound to be depraved, and prone\nto vice, and not easily amenable to words,\u201d so that they will\n\u201cdesist from evil-doing, and leave others in peace,\u201d as\nwell as become \u201chabituated in this way,\u201d and\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q95 A1). This power\nis not available for anyone to use: Aquinas argues that the coercive\nfunction should be \u201cvested in the whole people or in some public\npersonage,\u201d and not allowed to private parties (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q90 A3). He does allow, however, that some parties,\nsuch as the head of a household (\u201can imperfect\ncommunity\u201d), must be able to use an \u201cimperfect coercive\npower, which is exercised by inflicting lesser punishments, for\ninstance by blows, which do not inflict irreparable harm\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nAquinas also supports the common view that at least some coercion\naffects the coercee\u2019s responsibility or blameworthiness for what\nhe does as a result of coercion. He holds that one is not to be blamed\nfor things done non-voluntarily. Insofar as violence undercuts the\nvoluntariness of one\u2019s doings, as suggested above, one is not to\nbe blamed for them. Violence appears able to coerce in two ways: when\nused directly against one\u2019s body (\u201ca man may be dragged by\nforce: but it is contrary to the very notion of violence, that he be\ndragged of his own will\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6 A4));\nand when used in a way that disables one\u2019s will (\u201cthe will\ncan suffer violence, in so far as violence can prevent the exterior\nmembers from executing the will\u2019s command\u201d (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q6 A4)). Interestingly, however, the\n threat[1]\n of violence that causes one to act from fear, or to avoid that\nviolence, does not make an act involuntary, on Aquinas\u2019\nunderstanding. So only some uses of violence to hinder another\u2019s\nactions have the effect of exempting the person targeted from blame\nfor things done as a result of\n violence.[2]\n",
