    "main_text": "Substances as Hylomorphic Compounds\n8. Substances as Hylomorphic Compounds\n\nThe role of form in this hylomorphic context is the topic of\n\u0396.7\u20139. (Although these chapters were almost certainly not\noriginally included in Book \u0396\u2014there is no reference to\nthem, for example, in the summary of \u0396 given in \u0397.1, which\nskips directly from \u0396.6 to \u0396.10\u2014they provide a link\nbetween substance and form and thus fill what would otherwise be a gap\nin the argument.) Since individual substances are seen as hylomorphic\ncompounds, the role of matter and form in their generation must be\naccounted for. Whether we are thinking of natural objects, such as\nplants and animals, or artifacts, such as houses, the requirements for\ngeneration are the same. We do not produce the matter (to suppose that\nwe do leads to an infinite regress) nor do we produce the form (what\ncould we make it out of?); rather, we put the form into the matter,\nand produce the compound (\u0396.8, 1033a30\u2013b9). Both\nthe matter and the form must pre-exist (\u0396.9, 1034b12).\nBut the source of motion in both cases\u2014what Aristotle calls the\n\u201cmoving cause\u201d of the coming to be\u2014is the form.\n\nIn production that results from craft (or art, techn\u00ea),\n\u201cthe form is in the soul \u201d (1032b23) of the\ncraftsman. For example, \u201cthe craft [of building] is the form [of\nthe house]\u201d (1034a24) and the craft, i.e., the form,\nis in the understanding, and hence in the soul, of the builder. The\nbuilder has in mind the plan or design for a house and he knows how to\nbuild; he then \u201cenmatters\u201d that plan or design by putting\nit into the materials out of which he builds the house. In natural\nproduction, the form is found in the parent, where \u201cthe begetter\nis of this same sort as the begotten (not that they are the same\nthing, certainly, nor one in number, but one in form)\u2014for\nexample, in the case of natural things. For human begets human\u201d\n(1033b29\u201331). But in either case, the form pre-exists\nand is not produced (1033b18).\n\nAs for what is produced in such hylomorphic productions, it is\ncorrectly described by the name of its form, not by that of its\nmatter. What is produced is a house or a man, not bricks or flesh. Of\ncourse, what is made of gold may still be described in terms of its\nmaterial components, but we should call it not \u201cgold\u201d but\n\u201cgolden\u201d (1033a7). For if gold is the matter\nout of which a statue is made, there was gold present at the start,\nand so it was not gold that came into being. It was a statue that came\ninto being, and although the statue is golden\u2014i.e., made of\ngold\u2014it cannot be identified with the gold of which it was\nmade.\n\nThe essence of such a hylomorphic compound is evidently its form, not\nits matter. As Aristotle says \u201cby form I mean the essence of\neach thing and the primary substance\u201d (1032b1), and\n\u201cby the substance without matter I mean the essence\u201d\n(1032b14). It is the form of a substance that makes it the\nkind of thing that it is, and hence it is form that satisfies the\ncondition initially required for being the substance of\nsomething. The substance of a thing is its form.\n\n",
