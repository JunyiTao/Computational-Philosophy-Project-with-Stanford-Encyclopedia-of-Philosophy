They include the heqi (\u201cjoining breaths\u201d or\n\u201cpneumas\u201d) ritual, practiced in the early Tianshi\ndao (Way of the Celestial Masters) between married couples in\norder to generate the \u201cseed people\u201d (zhongmin),\nwho would survive the impending end of world (Raz 2012: 186\u2013202;\nKleeman 2014; Mollier 2016). Certain traditions of Neidan (Internal\nAlchemy) also involve sexual conjunction, performed in order to enable\nthe male practitioner to collect the True Yang from the\nYin (represented in this case by the sexual essences produced\nby the female). In Neidan, these practice are contrasted with\nqingxiu, literally meaning \u201cpure\ncultivation\u201d.\n\nSeveral Daoist texts emphasize that the Yangsheng methods should not be\nperformed as the only way for \u201creturning to the Dao\u201d.\nOthers\u2014beginning with the Zhuangzi (ch. 15; Watson\n1968: 167\u201368)\u2014express criticism towards them. While some\nscholars have looked at these contrasts as examples of competition\ntaking place in a sort of \u201cself-cultivation market\u201d,\nDaoist authors take into account the state of realization afforded by the Yangsheng methods, which in their view is lower compared to other practices.\n",
