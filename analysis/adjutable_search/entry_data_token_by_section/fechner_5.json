    "main_text": "The Existence of Atoms\n6. The Existence of Atoms\n\nIn 1855 Fechner published a book much less famous than Nanna\nand Zend-Avesta but one just as important for the exposition\nof his philosophy: \u00dcber die physikalische und philosophische\nAtomlehre. While Nanna and Zend-Avesta make up\nthe speculative or metaphysical side of Fechner\u2019s philosophy,\nthe Atomlehre represents its positivist side. It is in this\nwork that Fechner puts forward his phenomenalism and verificationism.\nAll that exists, and all that we can meaningfully talk about, it now\nturns out, is an object of possible experience. It is as if the soul\nof the universe were swept away with a positivist broom\n\nThe Atomlehre was Fechner\u2019s contribution to a major\ncontroversy in the mid nineteenth century: the existence of the atom.\nFechner argued that, by the best standards of observation and\nexperiment then current in physics, the most probable view is that\natoms really do exist; they are not only a convenient fiction or a\nfallacious hypostasis. The simplest and most consistent interpretation\nof the data of observation and experiment is that there are atoms\nbehind the laws of experience. \n\nThe question of the existence of the atom had divided philosophy and\nnatural science against one another. The philosophers held that atoms\nare only a fiction or hypostasis, while the physicists claimed that\nthey are a reality, the best inference from observation and\nexperiment, even though they are unobservable themselves. This\ndisagreement among philosophers and scientists reflected their wider\ndisagreements about the nature of matter and scientific method. They\nwere opposed on three fronts. First, the philosophers held that matter\nis infinitely divisible and continuous, while the scientists\nmaintained that it is indivisible and discrete. Second, the\nphilosophers made forces fundamental, analyzing matter into powers of\nattraction and repulsion; the scientists, however, made matter the\nbasis of force, claiming that forces inhere in matter and that they\nare only a way of accounting for its law-like regularities. Third, the\nphilosophers stated that the fundamental questions about nature cannot\nbe settled by observation and experiment and have to be determined\na priori; the physicists insisted that every question of\nnatural science has to be determined by observation and experiment and\nthat questions about its very possibility are not the concern of\nnatural science. The chief philosophers, who were all Germans, were\nSchelling, Hegel and Herbart; their philosophy of nature was in the\ntradition of Kant\u2019s Metaphysische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der\nNaturwissenschaften. The main scientists, who were French, were\none and all experimental physicists, men like Andr\u00e9\nAmp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836), Augustin Cauchy (1858\u20131898) and\nAugustin Fresnel (1788\u20131827).\n\nAtomism had become such a controversial issue in the mid nineteenth\ncentury partly because of the rise of materialism, and partly because\nof the traditional reputation of atomism. Materialism had become a\nrising force in German philosophy in the early 1850s; and by\n1855\u2014the very year Fechner published his work\u2014Karl Vogt,\nHeinrich Czolbe, and Ludwig B\u00fcchner published their manifestos of\nmaterialism (Vogt 1855; B\u00fcchner 1855; Czolbe 1855). The German\nmaterialists were not unqualified champions of atomism. Though Czolbe\nhad explicitly defended it (1855: 105 and 1875: 95), B\u00fcchner was\nmore cautious, stating only that the atom was still a working\nhypothesis (1855 [1904: 39\u201340]). Nevertheless, the reputation of\natomism as a materialist doctrine had been formed since antiquity.\nAtomism, whose chief exposition was Lucretius\u2019 De rerum\nnaturae, stood for a completely naturalistic worldview.\n\nAs one could surmise from the author of Nanna and\nZend-Avesta, Fechner was not sympathetic to materialism and\nlamented its rising power in German life and letters. It was one of\nthe most interesting features of his book that it would attempt to\nbreak the traditional association of atomism with materialism. Fechner\nargued that atomism does not necessarily support materialism, and that\nit is indeed ultimately a better support for the beliefs in the\nexistence of God and immortality than the opposing view of the\nphilosophers. Part I of Atomlehre lays out the experimental\nevidence for physical atomism; but Part II states the case\nfor a philosophical atomism which supports a metaphysics\navowing the existence of God and immortality. The battle between\nphilosophy and physics about the existence of the atom should not be\nseen, at least in Fechner\u2019s view, as a struggle between faith\nand science. \n\nThe most remarkable feature of Fechner\u2019s book is that it is a\ndefense of atomism at all. In Nanna and Zend-Avesta\nFechner had expounded the organic vision of the universe so\ncharacteristic of romanticism. The support for that organic vision, as\nset forth by the Naturphilosophen (Schelling, Hegel, and\nHerbart), had been the dynamic theory of matter, according to which\nmatter consists essentially in living force. If matter consists in\nforce, the Naturphilosophen argued, then there is no\nfundamental difference in kind between mind and matter, because they\nare only different degrees of development and organization of force.\nIt was just this view of matter, however, that Fechner had rejected in\nhis Atomlehre. He was very explicit that force presupposes\nthe existence of matter, that trying to analyze matter into these\nforces was like trying to analyze sounds into the intervals between\nthem (Atom: 112, 113). But this repudiation of dynamicism\ninevitably poses the question: Did Fechner\u2019s atomism not\nundermine his\n organicism?[12]\n\n\nThe chief reason that Fechner advocates atomism is because he thinks\nthat it better explains the facts than its rival, dynamicism. Atomism\nis not simply a good model of explanation but the correct ontology,\ni.e., the right account of what exists in the world. That is to say,\natomism does not work simply on a hypothetical basis: if\natoms exist, then we can account for the phenomena; rather, it\npostulates that atoms do exist, and that only as such do they explain\nphenomena. The atomist knows that the existence of atoms cannot be\nconfirmed by experience; but he still insists that the only way to\nexplain what we do know about experience is to assume the existence of\natoms (Atom: 25, 30). Here again the natural scientist\nfollows the guide of analogy. He assumes that the same laws that hold\nfor the macroscopic world also hold for the microscopic, an assumption\nwhich brings consistency into his general worldview (Atom:\n33, 35\u20136, 88). Fechner concedes that many phenomena explicable\naccording to atomism are also explicable according to dynamicism; but\nhe insists that there always comes a point where phenomena reveal\nthemselves that dynamicism cannot explain (Atom: 13, 21, 24).\nWhen we examine mass macroscopic phenomena in greater\ndetail\u2014taking them apart into their microscopic\nconstituents\u2014we find that the facts we then discover are\nexplicable according to atomism alone. \n\nFechner cites the following experiments and phenomena in favor of\natomism. \n\nThe refraction of a ray of light into different colors was often\nregarded as a difficulty of the wave theory of light. Why should a\nsingle transparent ray suddenly transform itself into a multitude of\ncolors? The investigations of Cauchy have shown, however, that\nrefraction into different colors follows from, and is not\nonly consistent with, wave theory if one supposes that there\nare discrete particles in the aether (Atom:\n 18).[13]\n\nA heat ray (W\u00e4rmestralung) and heat conduction\n(W\u00e4rmefortpfanzung) seem to be very different phenomena.\nBut Fourier has demonstrated that conduction follows under the same\nlaws that hold for rays provided that one assumes rays consist in\ndiscrete particles (Atom: 22). \nThe phenomena of isomery\u2014objects having the same mass and\nchemical constitution but producing different experimental\nresults\u2014are explicable only according to atomism. The atomist\nassumes that there is something more to atoms beside their mass and\nchemical constitution: namely, their direction or positions. The\ndifferent results are then ascribed to the different directions or\npositions of the atoms (Atom: 37). The dynamicist, however,\ncan refer to only mass and chemical constitution.\nTwo crystal formations can be exactly alike in their parts and\nstructure even though they are incongruous with one another. The\natomist explains their incongruity from the different directions of\ntheir constituent atoms (Atom: 43)\nA rubber band, when stretched, eventually breaks in one place. The\ndynamicist cannot explain this break in a single place; his adherence\nto the principle of continuity forces him to claim that the rubber\nband stretches ad infinitum or breaks in all places. The\natomist explains the break from the growing distance between particles\ninside the band; the attraction between the particles lessens as the\nband stretches and the distance between the particles grows\n(Atom: 54\u201355) \nWhen a body expands because of heat, its density diminishes as its\nvolume increases (Atom: 45). The atomist can easily explain\nthis: the particles spread further apart from one another as the body\nis heated. \nThe atomist can explain organic development\u2014the\ndifferentiation of a primal mass into a multitude of organs and\nfunctions\u2014better than the dynamicist, because he claims that the\noriginal apparently undifferentiated mass in fact consists in many\ndifferent kinds of particles with their different structures\n(Atom: 60\u201362). The dynamicist, who chastens the atomist\nfor speculation beyond experience, can refer to only the small visible\ndifferences between primal masses, which are not sufficient to explain\ndifferentiation or the differences between individuals. \n\n\nAs case 1 demonstrates, Fechner still holds an aether theory. He even\nincludes the aether into his summary of his doctrine, according to\nwhich ponderable matter consists in spatially discrete parts, in\nbetween which there is an imponderable substance or aether\n(Atom: 79). Fechner admits, however, that there is much\nuncertainty about the relation of ponderable to imponderable matter.\nHe knew that the aether theory was problematic, though this did not\nstop him from referring to Cauchy\u2019s experiments. In the\nintroduction to Part I of Atomlehre, he is explicit that\natomism does not depend on the theory of aether (Atom:\n14\u201315). The question whether light or heat are atomistically\nexplicable is independent of the existence of the aether, he insists.\n\n\nIt was a crucial aspect of Fechner\u2019s defense of atomism that it\nmade no philosophical claims about the nature of matter itself. Its\nfoundation lies simply with its explanation of empirical phenomena; it\ndoes not attempt to answer deeper philosophical questions about the\npossibility of matter and experience. As Fechner put it: the physicist\ndoes not worry about a philosophical analysis of matter anymore than a\nbuilder troubles himself about the chemical analysis of his brick and\nmortar (Atom: 72). The philosopher always claimed that the\natomist did not go far enough in his analysis of matter, that he did\nnot try to answer ultimate questions. What he fails to see, however,\nis that the physicist does not attempt to answer such questions; he is\nonly trying to explain the data given in experience. From this modest\nempirical point of view, Fechner was willing to make significant\nconcessions to the dynamicist: perhaps matter did ultimately consist\nin forces of attraction and repulsion (Atom: 72); perhaps the\nspaces between matter were ultimately filled, so that everything is\ncontinuous after all (Atom: 76). \n\nBut this modest empiricist defense of atomism was disingenuous. It was\nonly half the story. For Fechner had a more aggressive philosophical\ndefense of atomism, a positivist-style counterattack which claimed\nthat the questions posed by the philosopher are meaningless. Unlike\nthe physicist, the philosopher does not intend to stay within the\nlimits of experience; he attempts to go beyond these limits to find\nthe conditions of their possibility. What makes experience possible\nfor him is the unconditioned, the thing-in-itself; and his\nspeculations therefore are so many attempts to know the\nthing-in-itself. But the thing-in-itself, Fechner insists, is an\nillusion, something which does not really exist (Atom: 94,\n98). The world does not consist in the appearances of a\nthing-in-itself but in nothing more than appearances (Atom:\n94). Matter is only what appears, or what would appear under certain\ncircumstances (Atom: 95). The idea that there is something\nbehind the appearances, something that makes them all one thing, is\nsimply an hypostasis, the reification of a concept that unites all\nthese appearances into one (Atom: 96). As part of this\ncounterattack, Fechner went on to argue that the dynamicist\u2019s\nconcept of force or power is only a reification of the concept of a\nlaw (Atom: 106). It did not even make sense to analyze a body\ninto its powers because power is only a relational concept between\nbodies; to attempt to construct matter from powers would be like\nconstructing sound from tone intervals (Atom: 112). \n\nAlso in the spirit of this counterattack, Fechner sets out a\ndefinition of matter which spurns any philosophical account of it.\nMatter is defined as what resists the sense of touch; it is nothing\nmore nor less than \u201ctangibility\u201d\n(Handgreiflichkeit) (Atom: 90). In response to the\nphilosopher, who asks what is it that is so tangible, Fechner replies\nthat it is nothing more than what he feels and what he infers from\nthat feeling (Atom: 92). Fechner does not then allow the\nphilosopher to speculate about the sources or conditions of that\nfeeling. Rather, he claims the very idea that there is something\nbehind this feeling, that there is a reality that that makes it\npossible, is an illusion (Atom: 94). \n\nHence Fechner\u2019s defense of atomism is not what it first appears\nto be, or at least not what he pretends it to be. It does not carve\nout a realm of experience in which atomism holds, then leaving aside a\ntranscendent realm which is the proper domain of metaphysics. Instead,\nFechner argues that there is no such transcendent realm and that\nmetaphysics deludes itself when it speculates about it. In this\nrespect, Fechner\u2019s attack on metaphysics anticipates exactly\nwhat Otto Liebmann would write ten years later in his famous Kant\nund die Epigonen (1865). \n\nThough he was very aggressive in his attack on the philosophers,\nFechner insisted that he had nothing against philosophy per\nse; his target was only contemporary philosophy,\nspecifically the metaphysics of Schelling, Hegel, and Herbart\n(Atom: xiii). The second part of his book was indeed devoted\nto his own philosophy, his own metaphysics of matter. It would give up\nthe empirical limits on physical atomism, and then attempt to\nprovide a philosophical atomism, which would give \u201cthe\nultimate construction of matter itself\u201d (Atom: viii).\nFechner reassured his readers that he was not sacrificing their\ndemands for a worldview and that he would sketch one of his own. He\nexpressed his complete agreement with the philosophers about the need\nto investigate \u201cthe most universal, the highest and the\nultimate\u201d; he said that he differed from them only in\nhow he wanted to conduct such an investigation. While\nSchelling, Hegel and Herbart had followed an a priori\nmethodology, which preceded natural science, Fechner insisted on an\na posteriori methodology which would be based upon the\nnatural sciences. His metaphysics would come after, not\nprior to or before, physics (Atom: 126).\nThe foundation for his metaphysics would be nothing less than the\nwhole of natural science (Atom: 127). \n\nThe great hope of Fechner, like many other philosophers of his age\n(Trendelenburg, Lotze, Hartmann), was that the natural sciences could\nprovide a worldview more reliable than the a priori methods\nof the old metaphysics. The old metaphysics here was not simply the\nrationalism of Leibniz and Wolff but the metaphysics of natural\nscience of Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Herbart, which was still\nindebted to the old rationalism in its faith in pure reason. This new\nworldview would still be able to satisfy the interests of morality and\nreligion; and it would disarm the threat of materialism, which\nregarded the old morality and religion as little more than\nsuperstition. \n\nThe distinguishing feature of Fechner\u2019s new metaphysics is his\ninsistence that it is based upon experience alone rather than the\na priori reasoning of the old Naturphilosophie.\nAccordingly, the basic principle of his philosophical atomism is that\natoms are \u201climiting concepts\u201d in the analysis of\nexperience. This means that they represent the ultimate units of\nanalysis hitherto, so that they involve no claim that the\nanalysis is complete. Atoms must be defined strictly in relation to\nthe empirically given; they are not points behind or beyond space and\ntime but within it; but there is always the stipulation that however\nsmall they are represented to be is never enough (Atom: 132).\nThey appear to our representation as the smallest visible and tangible\npoints; yet they are are smaller than the smallest we can see and\ntouch (Atom: 156). \n\nFechner\u2019s new metaphysics did not avoid the problems or the\nconcepts of the old metaphysics; it simply cast them in a\nquasi-empirical dress. Though Fechner adamantly insists that his atoms\nbe defined empirically, he goes on to attribute to them the classic\nproperties of the monad, all of which transcend the empirically given.\nThus he writes that his atoms are utterly simple beings, having no\ncharacteristics (Atom: 133); that they are extensionless\npoints (Atom: 120); and that they are completely independent\nof one another, so that they cannot be connected to one another\n(Atom: 142). Now Fechner confronts the old conundrum which\ncaused so much trouble for Leibniz: How do unextended points give rise\nto the extended entities of experience? Fechner breezily dismisses the\nproblem. Extension does not arise from the atoms themselves but the\nrelationships between them; it is their aggregation which gives rise\nto their spatial appearance (Atom: 156\u2013157). But this\nquick solution still did not explain how spatial relationships could\narise from spaceless beings. \n",
