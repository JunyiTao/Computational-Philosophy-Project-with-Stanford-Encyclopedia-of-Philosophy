    "main_text": "Testimony\n6. Testimony\n\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika among the Vedic schools\nalong with Buddhists who of course impugn the \u201ctestimony\u201d of the Veda\nreject testimony as an independent knowledge source,\npram\u0101\u1e47a. Buddhists claim that their\nreligious teachings are founded on nothing other than reasoning and\nexperience, albeit mystical experience, the\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a experience that makes a\nBuddha an expert about spiritual matters. As with memory, whose\ncorrectness is dependent on the veridicality or non-veridicality of the\ncognition that forms the sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra\nmemory-impression, the veridicality of testimony depends on the\nknowledge of the testifier, the speaker, whose source has to be bona fide, namely,\ndepending on the epistemological theory,\nperception or inference or perhaps testimony in a series where an original testifier \nwould know by means of a source other than testimony . Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nand Yog\u0101c\u0101ra join together in seeing a hearer H\u2019s knowledge\nthat p which other philosophers see as flowing from testimony\nas really resulting from an inference having as one premise that the\nspeaker S is trustworthy and as another that S has said p, assuming\nthat trustworthy people who know the truth communicate it faithfully, to\nconclude that p is true. Ny\u0101ya resists such as\ninferentialist account from the earliest, in the s\u016btras of\nGautama, claiming that the inferentialist conflates inferential\ncertification of the truth of p with testimonial knowledge\nthat p at a first or unreflective level (as nicely explained\nby Mohanty 1994). V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and others argue (under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.1.52) that the certification\nconditions are different for the two knowledge sources. The\neighth-century Jayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nwrites (Ny\u0101ya-ma\u00f1jar\u012b 322):\n\u201cThe conditions that determine inferential knowledge and those that\ndetermine verbal knowledge are not the same.\u201d The Ny\u0101ya position\nis that comprehension and acceptance are normally fused such that\n(normally) we do get knowledge immediately (non-inferentially) from\nbeing told. Here they join\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, though there is also\nmuch controversy on this matter between the two schools.\n\nGautama provides a definition at Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra\n1.1.7: \u201cTestimony is the (true) statement of an expert\n(\u0101pta).\u201d An \u201cexpert,\u201d \u0101pta, is a\ntrustworthy authority such that \u201cexpert\u201d is not entirely adequate as a\ntranslation. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana in defining the term outlines a moral\ndimension. An \u0101pta is a person who not only knows the\ntruth but who wants to communicate it without deception\n(V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s commentary under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.7). The commentator also\nbrings out a certain egalitarianism in the workings of the knowledge\nsource. Contra the privilege afforded the priestly caste in matters of\nVedic interpretation, he says that even foreigners\u2014\u201cbarbarians,\u201d\nmleccha\u2014can be the experts whose statements convey to us\ntestimonial knowledge, provided, as always, they know the truth and\nwant to communicate without deception.\n\nAccording to those who accept testimony as a genuine knowledge source, the process of generating testimonial knowledge begins with a speaker S\nwho knows a proposition p by perception, inference, or\ntestimony (chains of testimony are okay) and who has a desire to\ncommunicate p to someone or other. A hearer H gains knowledge\nthrough a speech act of S communicating p to H, who has to be\ncompetent in the language in which p is expressed, to know the\nwords and grammatical forms, which H has learned, on most accounts,\nalso chiefly through testimony but also in other ways such as analogy\n(according to some).\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, whose leaders Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara are followed by many Ved\u0101ntins and by some\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, comes to the debate about testimony with an\naxe to grind, namely, to defend Vedic authority. The words of the Veda\nare not spoken by anyone originally. Speakers are subject to error but\nnot the Veda, whose verses are not originally composed\n(apauru\u1e63eya). Ved\u0101ntic theists, in the main, along\nwith almost all Ny\u0101ya philosophers, take the position that like\nall sentences, those of the Veda should be understood as spoken (or\ncomposed, etc.) by someone with the intention to communicate. Thus\nthe Lord, \u012b\u015bvara, is the author of the Veda (the best or\nonly candidate, according to Udayana, eleventh century,\nNy\u0101ya-kusum\u0101\u00f1jal\u012b).\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, however, is atheistic, viewing the Veda\nas primordial, resounding in the ether that surrounds the universe,\nheard and memorized by great rishis in\ntheir pellucid consciousness (not cluttered by ordinary thought). Thus\naccording to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, sentences can be meaningful\nwithout having a speaker with an intention to communicate.\nVed\u0101ntin and Ny\u0101ya theists generalize from the everyday to\nassume that, no, statements and sentences require a speaker, a\ncomposer, who, in the case of S\u2019s knowledge passing to H, must be an\n\u0101pta expert, i.e., someone who knows the truth and wants\nto tell it without a desire to deceive. The Lord is this speaker in the\ncase of the Veda, it is inferred by some.\n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara takes the view that everyday testimonial\nknowledge wears, like all knowledge, its truth on its sleeve; similarly\nVedic knowledge. Speaker\u2019s intention is irrelevant. A parrot can make\nus know something like a tape-recorder. And even a liar (S) deceived\ninto believing p can communicate \u00acp trying\nto deceive H who nevertheless learns the truth through S\u2019s statement.\nNy\u0101ya, in contrast, champions speaker\u2019s intention,\nt\u0101tparya, as epistemically relevant. According to the\nlater writers, speaker\u2019s intention is not the trigger of testimonial\nknowledge on H\u2019s part (which is instead the transmitting sentence under\nthe interpretation of H), but is a slightly upstream causal factor\nrelevant for certification. If we knew it were a parrot or a liar who\nwas responsible for the statement, we would no longer believe. It is\ntrue that H has to understand something in the case of the parrot, etc.\nOtherwise, there would be nothing to check in finding out that the\nparrot\u2019s speaking is a case of \u201capparent testimony,\u201d\n\u015babda-\u0101bh\u0101sa (e.g.,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba,\nTattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i, testimony\nchapter, 329). But discerning speaker\u2019s intention is championed as\nnecessary for disambiguation in some cases of testimony and as relevant\nto triggering figurative speech according to many including writers in\nthe aesthetics literature called\nala\u1e45k\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra.\n\nTestimonial knowledge is a matter of comprehending a statement, a\ntransmitting sentence, and to be a transmitting sentence certain\nconditions must be met. The following three necessary conditions for a\nmeaningful statement are proposed and discussed throughout the\nphilosophical and grammatical literatures (Kunjunni Raja 1969:\n149\u2013169).\n\n\nwords\u2019 mutual \u201cexpectancy,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101\nsemantic \u201cfittingness,\u201d yogyat\u0101\ncontiguity (or proper presentation, pronunciation and the like),\n\u0101satti\n\n\nThe words in a sentence have their \u201cexpectancy\u201d mutually\nsatisfied in the completion of the sentence as a string of words. This\nand the third condition are pretty obviously required for sentential\nmeaning, but not the second, at least not to philosophers of language\nin the West, although the notion seems related to the a priori\nas understood in early modern philosophy. In any case, semantic\n\u201cfittingness\u201d is connected to a theory of figurative meaning throughout\nthe schools including the aesthetics literature. A stock negative\nexample is \u201cThe gardener is watering the plants with fire\u201d\n(agnin\u0101 si\u00f1cati). Watering cannot be done\nwith fire, and so the meanings of the words do not fit together except\npossibly figuratively. Some define yogyat\u0101 in a positive\nfashion, but it seems easy to find counterexamples (Kunjunni Raja 1969:\n164\u2013166). Language has to be flexible so that we can report novelties.\nFurthermore, we understand something when we understand a false\nstatement. Otherwise, again, we would not know where to look to\ndetermine its falsity, or truth, for that matter.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba says explicitly that false\nstatements as well as statements of doubt meet the requirement of\nsemantic fittingness\n(Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\ntestimony chapter, 372\u2013373). Even statements that are not just false\nbut that we know are false can pass the semantic-fittingness test, as,\nfor example, (in the quip by A. Chakrabarti 1994) the views of one\u2019s\nopponents! For these and other reasons,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, for one, defines\nyogyat\u0101 negatively as \u201cabsence of knowledge of a blocker\n(of testimonial knowledge)\u201d\n(Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\ntestimony chapter, Sanskrit, IV.iii.6, p. 136). This shows a coherence\ntie. We cannot even understand testimony way out of whack with what we\nknow already.\n\nTwo M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views compete to explain sentential\nunity, along with a third, a sentence holism belonging to the\ngrammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari (third century), who holds that words have\nno meaning outside the context of the sentence, which is the basic\nsemantic unit. Words are abstractions from sentences, and a sentence\nis understood holistically \u201cin a flash\u201d\n(spho\u1e6da; Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s theory is\ncalled spho\u1e6da-v\u0101da). This is an easy target for\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas, who point to our abilities to use\nthe same words in different sentences. But the one camp, the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara, agrees with the grammarian that words do not\nconvey meaning apart from the full sentence being understood, that is\nto say, apart from the full fact indicated being known \u201cin a\nflash,\u201d as it were. The other camp, the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nwhose theory comes to be taken over by Ny\u0101ya, claims that\nindividual words have reference in isolation, and that in\nunderstanding a sentence we understand the meaning of the individual\nsemantic units which get combined not so much by the sentence as by\nthe fact that makes a true sentence true, the relation holding the\nfact together becoming reflected in the unity of the sentence, so that\neach word\u2019s meaning or referent is hooked up with every other. These\ntwo views are termed in\nSanskrit anvita-abhidh\u0101na-v\u0101da, \u201creference of\nthe connected,\u201d which Siderits (1991) translates as the\n\u201crelated designation view,\u201d\nand abhihita-anvaya-v\u0101da, \u201cconnection of the\nreferents,\u201d which Siderits translates as the\n\u201cwords-plus-relation view.\u201d However, the latter might not\nbe the best rendering, since its advocates argue that the relation is\nnothing other than the individual denotees as related.\n\nIn other words, according to the more radically referentialist view,\nwhich is incrementalist, the relation is not just an additional\nelement: it\u2019s not words-plus-relation. No word is\n\u201cunsaturated\u201d; \u2018bringing\u2019 for example,\nrequires that its referent be related to both an agent and an object\nand no reference to bringing would generate a bit of new testimonial\nknowledge if these were not also mentioned or the ideas of them\nsupplied. There are only a few purely logical and syntactically\nbinding words in Sanskrit, only a few (mainly connectives) that are\njust syncategorematic, since every other word is inflected and there\nis no need for prepositions, etc. Alternatively, we could say that\nevery word is unsaturated because no word, no single semantic unit,\nconveys the meaning of a sentence by itself alone independently of its\nrelation to at least one other unit. The main difference between the\ntwo M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views is that the former insists that\nonly a sentence successfully refers, not the individual words of which\na sentence is composed, whose meanings have to be connected to one\nanother in order for there to be reference (abhidh\u0101, the\nprimary mode or power,\n\u015bakti, of language); whereas the latter holds\nthat words do have reference individually but not to the connection of\nthe things mentioned, which is given by the sentence as a whole. In\nboth cases, the fact or object known by way of a sentence has\nconstituents. On the second view, the fact is the relatedness of the\nwords\u2019 referents as they are in the world, a relatedness\n(anvaya) not indicated by a semantic unit. The connection is\nto one another of the things referred to, a connection in the world\nwhich we become aware of because of the order and connectedness\n(anvaya) of the words. Gopinath Bhattacharya writes apropos\n(seventeenth-century) Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s\ndiscussion of the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\ntheory (Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da: 301\u2013302): \u201cIt\ncomes to this then that the understanding of a statement, i.e., of what\nis signified by the constituent terms in relation to one another,\ndepends among other things on the presentation of the terms in the\nrequired order. But the order of arrangement of the terms is not\nitself a term of the sentence, so that it cannot be said that this\norder has its own \u015bakti like the terms.\u201d\n\nJust what a word refers to is sometimes ambiguous not just apart from\nsentential context but within it. Still we know what the word means. We\nknow that a speaker wants salt when S asks for it even though in\nSanskrit the word used for salt, \u2018saindhava\u2019, is a homonym\nwith a word that means horse. S\u2019s intention to communicate p\nis in such a case crucial to disambiguation in that S speaks in a\ncontext (prakara\u1e47a). Ordinarily, the\noverall context need not be taken into account, according to New\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, to ascertain the meaning of a sentence, which\nhas to meet only the three conditions of grammaticality, semantic\nfittingness, and proper pronunciation. But we do have to take into\naccount the overall context\u2014let us say \u201cspeaker\u2019s intention,\u201d\nt\u0101tparya\u2014it is stressed (e.g., by\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da: 294\u2013295), in some\ncases of ambiguity as also of figurative speech, which involves a\nsecond power of words, the power (\u015bakti) to\nexpress meaning indirectly.\n\nHowever, we have to be able to understand a spoken sentence to be able\nto determine a speaker\u2019s intention, which we infer from what is said\nsupplemented sometimes by contextual cues. Thus knowing the intention\nis not an invariable antecedent of testimonial knowledge. Understanding\nS\u2019s intention is not a fourth condition on a statement\u2019s meaningfulness\nfrom the perspective of H\u2014except in some cases of ambiguity and\nindirect, figurative speech. But in those cases it is indeed crucial,\nand there is no way to get around the need to make it out in order to\nfix the meaning, which cannot be gathered at, so to say, a first pass.\n\nBut on a second pass, we are able to gather not only indirect,\nsecondary meaning but also more information through inference. In this\nway, Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da would explain what\nothers see as the results of the activation of a third power of words,\nnamely, dhvani, also called vya\u00f1jana,\n\u201csuggestion\u201d (289\u2013293). In other words, if a sentence contains an\nambiguous word or indirect, figurative meaning (admitted as a bona\nfide second power of words, \u015bakti), there\nmay well be no way to tell what it means without considering S\u2019s\nintention. Now advocates of the third power analyze the stock example\nof indirect speech where a village is said to be in the\nGa\u1e45g\u0101 as suggesting that the village is cool\nand purified by association with the Ga\u1e45g\u0101.\nThe whole point, they argue, of poetic use of indirect, figurative\nspeech is to release the third power of suggestion. Why otherwise not\nsimply say that the village is on the river bank? The speaker uses the\nfigurative speech to suggest the attributes of coolness and\npurification. Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da responds\nthat if one understands from the statement these attributes then the\nindirect, figurative meaning\n(lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) of \u201cin\nthe Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u201d is not just being on the bank of\nthe river but on a bank that lends coolness and fosters purification.\nThis is then just a more complex case of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101,\nwhich is indeed a second power of words (but there is no third),\nindicating a cool and purifying location on the indicated bank.\n\nFinally we might mention that with veridical testimonial knowledge not\ninvolving figurative meaning where all three sentential conditions are\nmet, we do not notice the grammaticality, etc., of the transmitting\nsentence or sentences. These factors have to be present, but we do not\nhave to be aware of them. For figurative meaning, in contrast, we have\nto notice a blocker (Uddyotakara under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.59), which paradigmatically\nmay be thought of as a violation of semantic fittingness (Kunjunni Raja\n1969: 166), though this is not precisely correct according to several\ntheorists who provide examples of figures where semantic fittingness is\nnot violated. Examples of less severe misfit occur than to water with\nfire. Violating yogyat\u0101 is not the only way to trigger\nthe second power of words. Yet further exploration of figurative\nmeaning and of \u201csuggestion\u201d (dhvani) would carry us outside of\nthe epistemological into the aesthetics and grammatical\nliteratures.\n",
