    "main_text": "What is Globalization? || Economic Globalization\n1.1 Economic Globalization\n\nEconomic globalization refers to the processes of global economic\nintegration that emerged in the late 20th century, fueled\nby neoliberal ideals. Rooted in classical liberal economic thought,\nneoliberalism claims that a largely unregulated capitalist economy\nembodies the ideal of free individual choice and maximizes economic\nefficiency and growth, technological progress, and distributive\njustice. Economic globalization is associated with particular global\npolitical and economic institutions, such as the World Trade\nOrganization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, and\nspecific neoliberal economic policies, such as the following:\n\nTrade liberalization. Free trade policies, such as the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (also known as the New NAFTA),\nseek to integrate regional or global markets by reducing trade\nbarriers among nations. Signatory countries typically agree to\neliminate tariffs, such as duties and surcharges, as well as nontariff\nobstacles to trade, such as licensing regulations, quotas on imports,\nand subsidies to domestic producers. \nDeregulation. Trade liberalization is associated with the\neasing of restrictions on capital flow and investment, along with the\nelimination of government regulations that can be seen as unfair\nbarriers to trade, including legal protections for workers, consumers,\nand the environment. \nPrivatization of public assets. Economic globalization is\nmarked by the sale of state-owned enterprises, goods, and services to\nprivate investors in the name of expanding markets and increasing\nefficiency. Such assets include banks, key industries, highways and\nrailroads, power and electricity, education, and healthcare.\nPrivatization often also involves the sale of publicly owned,\neconomically exploitable natural resources, such as water, minerals,\nforests, and land, to private investors.\nElimination of social welfare programs. Neoliberalism\nfavors sharp reductions in public expenditures for social services,\nsuch as housing, health care, education, and disability and\nunemployment insurance, as a crucial means of reducing the role of\ngovernment and making private businesses more efficient. Structural\nAdjustment Policies (SAPs) have been instrumental in requiring\ncountries in the global South to eliminate social welfare spending.\nSince the early 1980s, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund\nhave required debtor nations to adopt SAPs as a condition of borrowing\nmoney or improving conditions of existing loans. SAPs require debtor\nnations to restructure their economies along neoliberal lines, by, for\nexample, removing government regulation, eliminating social welfare\nprograms, and promoting market competition.\nRestrictions on immigration. While many countries have\nliberalized capital markets and eased barriers to transnational trade\nin goods and services under globalization, most have not eliminated\nbarriers to the flow of labor. Indeed, some affluent countries, such\nas the United States, have implemented more restrictive immigration\npolicies, leading to the detention and deportation of thousands of\nundocumented immigrants and the militarization of national borders.\nDespite these restrictions, however, migration has increased along\nwith other processes of globalization.\n\n\nPolitical philosophers are concerned with the effects of these\npolicies on human well-being. Proponents of globalization claim that\neconomic liberalization has enabled many people throughout the world\nto move out of conditions of dire poverty. Open markets, they argue,\nhave increased employment and productivity within developing\ncountries, raising the standard of living and enhancing the well-being\nof the people living within them (Diamandis and Kotler 2012, Friedman\n2012, Micklethwait and Wooldridge 2000, O\u2019Neil 2013). Critics\npoint out that neoliberal policies have created the widest gap between\nthe very rich and very poor in history, with unprecedented wealth for\nthe rich and poverty and destitution for millions of the global poor\n(Nikiforuk 2007, Pogge 2002). Feminists have pointed out that pockets\nof highly concentrated wealth in the \u201cglobal South\u201d and\nthe high levels of extreme poverty in the \u201cglobal North\u201d\nmean that we cannot divide the world neatly along North/South or\nrich/poor lines (Silvey 2014). However, on the whole, they argue,\nglobalization has benefitted the world\u2019s wealthiest\npeople\u2014both citizens of the global North and the elite in\ndeveloping countries\u2014without substantially benefitting the\nmajority of the world\u2019s population.\n\nFeminist philosophers insist that economic globalization must also be\nunderstood in terms of the effects it has had on women, who make up a\ndisproportionate percentage of the global poor. Most agree that these\neffects have been primarily negative. For instance, Jaggar argues that\nglobalization has promised many things that are crucial to feminists:\npeace, prosperity, social justice, environmental protection, the\nelimination of racism and ethnocentrism, and, of course, an increase\nin the status of women. However, neoliberal policies have brought\nabout the opposite of these aspirations. Rather than peace, they have\ncreated conditions for war and increased militarism; rather than\nprosperity and social justice, they have increased the gulf between\nthe rich and the poor; rather than environmental protection, they have\nled to the privatization and destruction of publicly-owned natural\nresources; and rather than eliminating racist, ethnocentric, and\nsexist barriers, globalization has been, ultimately, \u201ca system\nhostile or antagonistic to women\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 301).\n",
