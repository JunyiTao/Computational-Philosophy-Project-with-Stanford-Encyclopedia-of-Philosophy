    "preamble": "\n\nThe Greek-Arabic sciences penetrated in the Islamic world during the\n8th-10th centuries AD due to the massive\nactivity of the translators and al-Kindi\u2019s vision of knowledge\nand also through the exegetical activity of the Aristotelian circle of\nBaghdad. From the end of the 10th, throughout the\n11th, and up to the beginning of the 12th\ncenturies, the production of original philosophical literature into\nArabic and Persian became the main stream of the Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy, which was by then increasingly distant from the Greek\nsources in Arabic translation. Avicenna\u2019s works fully attest\nthis phenomenon, which prompted a 12th century purist trend\nwell exemplified in the Muslim West by Averroes\u2019 program of\ngoing back to Aristotle: a similar but not identical phenomenon\noccurred also in the Muslim East, with Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad\n\u2018Abd al-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif was a philosopher and polymath who lived between\nthe Second Crusade (1147\u20131149 AD) and the end of the Fifth\nCrusade (1217\u20131231 AD) (Jackson 2017). He was born in Baghdad in\n1162 and died there on 9 November 1231 after a pilgrimage of more than\nforty years during which he travelled throughout Iraq, Syria and Egypt\nlooking for a good teacher in philosophy. He grew up in a\nShafi\u2018i family with excellent links with the Nizamiyya madrasa\nand he received a solid education in Islamic sciences. Then he turned\nto natural sciences, medicine, philosophy and, critically, to alchemy.\nHis spasmodic search for knowledge brought him to meet through their\nwritings Avicenna, al-Ghazali and al-Suhrawardi. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nhad many generous patrons and was in touch with the most important men\nof his era including the Saladin and, in Cairo, Maimonides. Cairo\nrepresented for \u2018Abd al-Latif the much-desired goal of his\npilgrimage, the place where he finally met Aristotle and his\nphilosophy as well as that of his commentators Themistius and\nAlexander, and where he finally encountered the work of the greatest\nArabic Aristotelian commentator of the East, al-Farabi. For \u2018Abd\nal-Latif, Cairo also meant the progressive abandonment of\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy, which he had held to be the only one\npossible during the earlier years of his education. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif was a sharp critic, an independent thinker, and a prodigious\nwriter on philosophy and medicine. His stated intellectual program was\nthat to go back to the original Greek works in Arabic translation, and\nin particular to return to Aristotle in philosophy and to Hippocrates,\nvia Galen, in medicine, but he was able to go back to these sources\nonly through the lens of their reworkings by the philosophers before\nAvicenna, al-Kindi and al-Farabi.\n",

    "main_text": "\n Life and Works\n1.1 Life\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s intellectual position comes across in his\nautobiography (sira). It seems to have formed part of a\nlarger work no longer extant which he wrote for his son Sharaf al-Din\nYusuf. The sira is contained in the Sources of\nInformation on the Classes of Physicians by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi\u2018a (Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a, c. 1242 [1882\u201384],\nKitab \u2018Uyun al-anba\u2019 fi tabaqat al-atibba\u2019,\nA. M\u00fcller (ed.), al-Qahira: al-Matba\u2018at al-wahbiyya,\n1882\u20131884: II. 201\u2013213; Martini Bonadeo 2013). At the\nbeginning of 19th century it was edited and translated into\nLatin by Mousley (Mousley 1808) and re-edited and translated into\nFrench by de Sacy (de Sacy 1810). A second autobiography is included\nin the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice composed in Erzincan\nin 1225 and preserved in the ms. Bursa, Il Halk K\u00fct\u00fcphanesi,\nHuseyin \u00c7elebi 823 (see Stern 1962; Dietrich 1964; Gutas 2011;\nMartini Bonadeo 2013; Joosse 2014; Jad 2017; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben\nAhmed 2018). A third autobiography, lost for us, is probably quoted by\nhis pupil Ibn Khallikan (Ibn Khallikan, Shams al-Din Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad, d. 1282 [1968\u20131977], Wafayat al-a\u2018yan\nwa-anba\u2019 abna\u2019 al-zaman, I. Abbas (ed.), Beirut: Dar\nSadir, 1968\u20131977: IV.76\u201377). Other passages from \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s autobiography have been preserved by\nal-Dhahabi\u2019s History of Islam (Von Somogyi 1937; Cahen\n1970). Finally, further information on \u2018Abd al-Latif can be\nfound in the report of his journey in Egypt entitled Book of the\nReport and Account of the Things which I Witnessed and the Events Seen\nin the Land of Egypt, a compendium extracted from his own history\nof Egypt, The Long Book about Egypt, lost to us (Wahl 1790;\nde Sacy 1810; Zand, Videan, & Videan 1965; Malallah 1987;\nMartini Bonadeo 2017; Kzzo-Bellucci 2020).\n\nHe was born in Baghdad between February and April in 1162 from an\nupper class family originating from Mosul and spent his formative\nyears in Baghdad until 1189. His contemporary Yaqut writes that\n\u2018by his descent (qadiman) he was known as\nIbn al-Labbad, a sort of family name (Yaqut al-Hamawi al-Rumi, d. 1229\n[1993], Mu\u2018jam al-udaba\u2019. Irshad al-arib ila\nma\u2018rifat al-adib, I. Abbas (ed.), Beirut: Dar al-Gharb\nal-Islami, 1993: IV.1571). In the years of his youth in Baghdad,\nunder the guidance of his father \u2013 Abu l-\u2018Izz ibn Muhammad\nal-Mawsili who had been a student of Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s\n(d. 1165) (Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a, c. 1242 [1882\u201384], Kitab\n\u2018Uyun al-anba\u2019 fi tabaqat al-atibba\u2019, A.\nM\u00fcller (ed.), al-Qahira: al-Matba\u2018at al-wahbiyya,\n1882\u20131884: I. 280; Toorawa 2004), \u2018Abd al-Latif\nstudied Islamic sciences and medicine with many renowned scholars,\nincluding Kamal ad-Din \u2018Abd al-Rahman al-Anbari (d.1181), a\nprofessor of fiqh (law), adab-literature,\nhadith (traditions) and Arabic grammar at the Nizamiyya\nmadrasa, Wagih al-Wasiti (d.1215), a professor at the Zafariyya\nMosque, Ibn Fadlan (d.1199), an outstanding legal scholar versed in\nthe khilaf (divergence of the law) and dialectic, and leader\nof the Shafi\u2018is in Iraq, \u2018Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn\nal-Khashshab (d.1171), master of hadith, grammarian,\nmathematician, expert in fara\u2019id (hereditary law) and\nnasab (genealogy), Radi al-Dawla Abu Nasr (d.ca.1182), son of\nthe well-known physician Amin al-Dawla Ibn al-Tilmidh, professor of\nmedical subjects.\n\nIn his hometown \u2018Abd al-Latif made his first steps in philosophy\nstudying al-Ghazali\u2019s Intentions of the Philosophers,\nthe Measure of Science in the Art of Logic, the Criterion\nof Action on Ethics and the Touchstone of Reasoning in\nLogic. Then he turned to Avicenna\u2019s books including the\nSalvation, the Cure, the Canon, and the\nValidation by Bahmanyar, a pupil of Avicenna. Finally still\nin Baghdad he studied Indian mathematics, Euclid\u2019s geometry, and\nmany books on alchemy by Jabir ibn Hayyan, but then he abandoned this\ndiscipline which he considered an irrational practice.\n\nAt the age of twenty-eight, in 1189, he left Baghdad and began a long\nperiod of travel in search for knowledge. First he was in Mosul for a\nyear. There he heard people saying great things about al-Suhrawardi.\nHe came across al-Suhrawardi\u2019s treatises the\nIntimations, the Glimmer, and the Ascending\nSteps; but he did not find in them the knowledge that he was\nlooking for. He left Mosul for Damascus where he joined the grammarian\nal-Kindi al-Baghdadi (d.1216) and he worked on a certain number of\ngrammatical treatises. In Damascus he took more and more distance from\nthe study and practice of alchemy. Then \u2018Abd al-Latif went to\nJerusalem and then to the Saladin near Acre. Here he came into contact\nwith Saladin\u2019s entourage: Baha\u2019 al-Din ibn Shaddad\n(1145\u20131234), his biographer and the chief of the army and the\ncity of Jerusalem, and \u2018Imad al-Din al-Katib al-Isfahani\n(d.1201), the chronicler of Saladin\u2019s deeds. With a safe-conduct\ndocument written by this latter \u2018Abd al-Latif arrived in\nCairo.\n\nHis aim in Egypt was to meet Yasin al-Simiya\u2019i, a not well known\nalchemist, and Moses Maimonides, the famous Jewish philosopher,\ntheologian, and doctor, born in Cordoba in 1135. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nrefused to work with the first for the senselessness of his teaching\nand found the latter excellent, but dominated by the desire to excel\nand by his political ambitions. \u2018Abd al-Latif read Maimonides\nGuide for the Perplexed and found it a bad book which\ncorrupted the tenets of faith and religion. \n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s encounter with the Peripatetic tradition\ntook place in the vibrant cultural environment of Cairo where he met\nAbu al-Qasim al-Shari\u2018i, who had expert knowledge of the works\nof the \u201cAncients\u201d and of those of Abu Nasr al-Farabi.\nPerhaps he was the renowned and famous master in the science of\nhadith Abu al-Qasim al-Busiri (or al-Busayri d.1202), as\nsuggested with caution by de Sacy (de Sacy 1810). But this\nidentification remains problematic, given the fact that nine\ncontemporary of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s bear the nisba\nal-Shari\u2018i, most of them members of scholarly families in Cairo,\nand two of them also bear the kunya Abu l-Qasim. In\naddition neither al-Busiri and nor the nine bearers of the\nnisba al-Shari\u2018i were known for their \nexpert philosophical knowledge (Griffel 2023). In Cairo, for the first\ntime \u2018Abd al-Latif studied the books of the\n\u201cAncients\u201d, namely Aristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nand Themistius, and on the basis of these he began to test the cogency\nof Avicenna\u2019s doctrines. From this he came to hold the\ninferiority of the work of Avicenna. Nevertheless, \u2018Abd al-Latif\nwas intimately loath to renounce he who had been his master and the\ninspiration behind his research from his youth.\n\nAfter 13 September 1192, the date of the armistice of the Ayyubids\nwith the Franks, \u2018Abd al-Latif moved to Jerusalem where he met\nthe Saladin in person who awarded him a generous stipend to teach in\nthe Umayyad mosque in Damascus. After the death of the Saladin\n(d.1193), the last years of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s life took the\nform of a long series of journeys, no longer in search of knowledge,\ninstruction, teachers and books, but all motivated by, or at the\nbehest of, patrons: in Damascus al-Malik al-Afdal, Saladin\u2019s\neldest son; in Cairo al-Malik al-Aziz, in Jerusalem al-Malik al-Adil\nSayf al-Din Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub, in Erzinjan al-Malik \u2018Ala\u2019\nal-Din Da\u2019ud ibn Bahram, in many other places in Anatolia\n(Erzerum, Kamah, Dvriji, Malatya) Seljuks patrons, in Aleppo Shihab\nal-Din Tughril. He taught in many different Madrasas and mosques\nincluding the al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, al-Azhar in Cairo, the\n\u2018aziziyya madrasa in Damasco. His contemporary al-Qifti \nreports that towards the end of his life he tried to practice\nmedicine, but was not successful because he was not enough a good\npractical physician (Ibn al-Qifti, d.1248 [1950\u20131955], Inbah\nal-ruwat \u2018ala anbah al-nuhat, M. Abu l-Fadl Ibrahim (ed.),\nal-Qahira: Dar al-Kutub al-Misriyya, 1950\u201355: II.196; Griffel\n2023). While he was in Aleppo, in autumn 1231, he wanted to go on\npilgrimage to Mecca, and he started his journey towards Baghdad to\nleave some of his works to the \u2018Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir ibn\nal-Zahir (r. 1226\u20131242). Once he arrived in Baghdad \u2018Abd\nal-Latif fell ill and died at the age of 69 on 9 November, 1231. He\nwas buried next to his father in the Wardiyya cemetery.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s students were: the hadith\nscholar Zaki al-Din al-Birzali (d.1239), the botanist Ibn al-Suri\n(d.1242), the judge al-Tifashi (d.1253), Ibn al-\u2018Adim (d. 1262),\nand the biographer Ibn Khallikan (d.1282).\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s\nharshest critic was al-Qifti who accused him of having been a\ntheoretician incapable of practicing medicine and a plagiarist.\nAl-Qifti\u2019s hostility against him was probably caused by\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s accusation of quackery and murder against\nJoseph ben Judah ben Simeon (Josse 2007; Griffel 2023).\n1.2 Works\n\nThe oldest lists of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s works are those given\nby Yaqut (Yaqut al-Hamawi al-Rumi, d. 1229 [1993], Mu\u2018jam\nal-udaba\u2019. Irshad al-arib ila ma\u2018rifat al-adib, I.\nAbbas (ed.), Beirut: Dar al-Gharb al-Islami, 1993: IV.1572\u20131573)\nand Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a at the end of the entry devoted to him in\nthe Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians (Ibn\nAbi Usaybi\u2018a, c. 1242 [1882\u201384]: II. 211\u2013213). Later\nlists are found in Ibn Shakir al-Kutubi\u2019s What was omitted\nin the Obituaries (Ibn Shakir al-Kutubi, before 1363 [1974],\nFawat al-wafayat, I. \u2018Abbas (ed.), Bayrut: Dar\nal-Sadir, 1974: II. 385\u2013388) and in al-Safadi (al-Safadi, Salah\nal-Din khalil ibn Aybak, d. 1363 [1929\u20132013], Al-Wafi\nbi-l-wafayat, H. Ritter et alii (eds.), Beirut: XIX.109\u2013111).\n\nThe list presented by Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a numbers one hundred and\nseventy-three works, including brief essays and treatises. The\nsubjects reflect the variety of \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s interests.\nThirteen writings are listed which deal with the Arabic language,\nlexicography, and grammar, two with fiqh, nine with literary\ncriticism, fifty-three with medicine, ten with zoology, three on the\nscience of tawhid (unity of God), three on history, three on\nmathematics and related disciplines, two on magic and mineralogy, and\ntwenty-seven on other themes. There are forty-eight works concerning\nphilosophy: nineteen on logic\u2014two of which are against Avicenna\nand the theory of conditional syllogisms\u2014ten on physics, eight\non metaphysics, and nine on politics. Two general works are also\nmentioned, divided into three sections: logic, physics, and\nmetaphysics; one of these was in ten volumes and was completed by the\nauthor over a span of twenty years.\n\nIbn Shakir al-Kutubi\u2019s list is shorter. It numbers fifteen\ndiscourses by \u2018Abd al-Latif which are not mentioned by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi\u2018a and eighty-one works, all mentioned in the previous\nlist, with the exception of one about antidotes.\n\nThe works which have come down to us, or at least those contained in\nmanuscripts so far identified (Martini Bonadeo 2013, Fedouache - Ajoun\n- Ben Ahmed 2018), concerning hadith, lexicography, and\ngrammar are\n\nthe Compendium for the Language of Hadith (al-Radi 1977,\n1979);\nthe Extract from the Book of the Essay on the Diadem in the\nSwords of the Prophet;\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s commentary on the caliph\nal-Nasir\u2019s collection of traditions entitled Rawh\nal-\u2018arifin;\nthe Extract from the Expressions of the Prophet and the\nCompanions of the Prophet and his Followers.\n\n\nAbout fiqh (law) there are\n\nthe Brief Study of the Laws in the Codes of Egypt;\nthe Commentary on the Collection by Abu Yahya \u2018Abd\nal-Rahim ibn Nubata al-Fariqi.\n\n\nAbout mathematics there is\n\nthe Book of That Which is Evident in Indian\nMathematics.\n\n\nOn medicine some works survived:\n\nthe Commentary on the Prognostics according to\nHippocrates (Joosse & Pormann 2012);\nthe Commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates (Joosse\n& Pormann 2012);\nthe Commentary on Hunayn\u2019s Medical Questions;\nthe Commentary on the Anatomy of Lutfallah al-Misri;\nthe Note on the Anatomy of the Commentary on the\nRevision;\nthe treatise On the Principles of Simple Medical Substances\nand their Natural Qualities.\n\n\nConcerning philosophy, there are:\n\nthe Essay on the Senses and Two Questions on their\nFunction (Ghalioungui & Abdou 1972; reprint Ghalioungui\n1985);\nthe Questions on Natural Science (Ghalioungui & Abdou\n1972; reprint Ghalioungui 1985);\nthe Book on the Science of Metaphysics (Badawi 1955a,b;\nNeuwirth 1976, 1977\u201378, 1978; Ajoun 2017; Martini Bonadeo\n2017).\n\n\nBesides these works further eleven treatises have been\npreserved\u2014among which is the already mentioned Book of the\nTwo Pieces of Advice\u2014in the miscellaneous manuscript Bursa,\nH\u00fcseyin \u00c7elebi 823 (Stern 1962; Jad 2017;\nFedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018, 3\u2013236):\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s criticism of the notes written by\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi on several passages from the Kulliyyat\nsection of Avicenna\u2019s Canon (fols 1v\u201319v and\n28r\u201334r);\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s criticism of the treatise on the\nSura of Pure Intention by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (fols\n34r\u201338v and 20r\u201323r);\nthe treatise On the Quiddity of Space According to Ibn\nal-Haytham (fols 23v\u201327v and 39r\u201352r; see Rashed\n2002, 4, 908\u201353) in which \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s attempt to\nrefute Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s geometrization of place and to restore\nAristotle\u2019s definition is a sort of defense of the primacy of\nphilosophy compared to mathematics (El-Bizri 2007);\nthe treatise On Mixing (fols 52v\u201362r) concerning\nthe combination of various elements in compound substances;\nthe Dispute Between an Alchemist and a Theoretical\nPhilosopher (fols 100v\u2013123v; Josse 2008, 2014; Jad\n2019);\nthe treatise On Minerals and the Confutation of Alchemy\n(fols 124r\u2013132r);\nthe Excerpta from the works of the philosophers chosen by\n\u2018Abd al-Latif (fols 132v\u2013135v; Rashed 2004) which are\nrelated to Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 Quaestiones (I\n11a, II 28, III 9) and an Arabic Quaestio, work number 39\nascribed to Alexander of Aphrodisias in Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2018a\u2019s\nlist of Alexander\u2019s works;\nthe Excerpta from medical works chosen by \u2018Abd\nal-Latif (fols 138r\u2013140v) in the form of a little handbook of\npharmacology, which presents the therapeutic effects of thirty-one\ndifferent plants;\nthe treatise On Diabetes (fols 140v\u2013149r; Thies\n1971; Degen 1977).\n\n2. What Philosophical Research is\n\nIn the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice, a diatribe against\nfalse knowledge, composed between 1217 and 1225 in Aleppo or in\nAnatolia, \u2018Abd al-Latif presents \u201ctwo pieces of\nadvice\u201d for would-be physicians and would-be philosophers, an\nimpassioned polemic against false physicians, and an equally harsh\ninvective against false philosophers (see Gutas 2011; Martini Bonadeo\n2013; Joosse 2014; Jad 2017; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018).\n\nThose who, in his age, devote themselves to philosophy are bad\nphilosophers for many different reasons: their lack of interest, the\nobscurity of philosophy and their lack of training and good teachers.\nBut the main reason for the decline of the philosophical production of\nhis age lies in the neglect into which the works of the Ancients have\nfallen. The pages of these works are by now being used by bookbinders\nand pharmacists as paper for packaging. No one\u2014says \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2014wants to deny the contributions made by Avicenna to\nphilosophical research. He has, in fact, provided new energy to\nphilosophy, and he has been able in part to understand the books of\nthe Ancients and to offer an introduction to them. Nevertheless, if\none examines his works in more detail and compares them with those on\nsimilar themes by ancient authors and, in particular, with Aristotle\nor al-Farabi, their inferiority emerges. For this reason \u2018Abd\nal-Latif proposes presenting the method followed by Plato and\nAristotle in their respective philosophies. In doing that, he follows\nal-Farabi, summarizes and literally quotes al-Farabi\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Plato and Aristotle (Rosenthal & Walzer\n1943; Mahdi 1961, 2001), where both Platonic dialogues and\nAristotelian treatises are set out in such an order as to constitute a\nsystematic and progressive investigation of all the areas of\nphilosophical research.\n\nFor \u2018Abd al-Latif, as for al-Farabi\u2019s Plato, philosophical\nresearch begins with an investigation of what constitutes the\nperfection of man as man, which does not consist of a healthy\nphysique, a pleasant face, noble descent, a large group of friends and\nlovers; nor does it consist in riches, glory, or power, since none of\nthese is able to make man fully and truly happy. For man the\nattainment of happiness consists in a particular type of knowledge,\nthe knowledge of the substances of all the beings and a certain\nlifestyle, the virtuous life. Knowledge of things according to their\nessence is not an end in itself, but is that which must characterize\nthe virtuous lifestyle of the philosopher: in him, in fact,\ntheoretical knowledge is the prolegomenon to action, ethics, and\npolitics. For this reason \u2018Abd al-Latif stresses that there is\nno difference between a man who lives in ignorance and the life of\nbeasts because in ignorance man acts like a beast. A life in ignorance\nis a life without the search for truth and, hence, inhuman in\nitself.\n\nIn this perspective \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces Plato\u2019s\npolitical philosophy. Since the perfection of the soul is possible\nonly in a city where justice reigns, Plato starts from analysis of\nwhat justice is and how it ought to be. Then Plato examines the cities\nwhich deviate from the good ways of life and from the philosophical\nvirtues. In the virtuous city, man must be educated in the knowledge\nof the divine and natural beings and in following a virtuous way of\nlife. Human perfection is achieved by the man who combines the\ntheoretical, the political and the practical sciences. He will rule\nand will possess the ability to conduct a scientific investigation of\njustice and the other virtues and to form the character of the youth\nand the multitude. He will be able to correct wrong opinions and to\ncure every rank of his society with knowledge. The ruler will be the\none who has achieved human perfection at its utmost.\n\nThen \u2018Abd al-Latif passes to present al-Farabi\u2019s Aristotle\nwho holds that the perfection of man sought by Plato is not\nself-evident or easy to explain by way of a demonstration which leads\nto certainty. He believes, therefore, that it is necessary to start\nwith a prior consideration. There are four things which by nature are\ndesired by man in so far as they are good: the soundness of the body,\nof the senses, of the ability to discern that which leads to the\nhealth of the body and the senses, and of the ability to obtain that\nwhich leads to their soundness. In the second place man desires to\nknow the causes of the sensible things and also the causes of what he\nsees in his soul, and he discovers that the more he knows the more he\nfeels pleasure. Thus according to Aristotle, the knowledge sought by\nman can be said to be of two types: the first is a useful knowledge\nsought for the soundness of the body, of the senses, and of the other\ntwo abilities, the second is desired and desirable in itself for the\npleasure that a man experiences in apprehending it: for instance, the\nmyths or the stories of nations.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif goes on by explaining that in human knowledge\nthere are three sorts of cognitions: those acquired by senses,\nfrequently insufficient, those first necessary cognitions that\noriginate with man, and those acquired by investigation and\nconsideration. \u2018Abd al-Latif asks himself what type of knowledge\nis most appropriate for man. Animals, too, in fact, have a body,\nsenses, and the ability to discern how and with what to safeguard\ntheir health. They do not, however, possess the desire, provoked by\nwonder, to know the causes of what can be seen in the heavens and on\nearth.\n\nThis problem involves the following question: why should man ever\ndesire to know the causes if the type of knowledge that they involve\nis not made for him? It is because man can grow in perfection by\nknowing the causes; indeed, knowing the causes is an act of the\nessence of man. Yet this statement opens up a series of problems. What\nis the essence of man, what is his ultimate perfection, what is the\nact whose realization leads to the final perfection of his essence?\nNevertheless, given that man is part of the world, if one wishes to\nknow the end of man and his activity he must first know the world in\nits totality. The four causes of the world in its totality and in each\nof its individual parts which must be sought are the what it is, the\nhow it is, the what it is from, and the what is it for.\n\nThe investigation which deals with the world, in its totality and in\neach of its individual parts, is called natural investigation, while\nthat which regards what man possesses by virtue and will is called the\nscience of the things that depend on the will. Since that which is\nnatural and innate in man precedes in time that which is in man by\nwill and choice, the first type of investigation will precede the\nsecond even if both must arrive at a certain science. Besides these\ntwo types of research is the art of logic which forms the rational\npart of the soul, leads it to certainty, to study and to research;\nlogic, moreover, guides and tests the validity of the other two fields\nof research.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif reminds that in Aristotle\u2019s science of\nnature the fundamental epistemological criterion holds that man must\nstart from what is attested to by the senses, to then proceed to what\nis hidden, until he knows everything which he desires to know. For\nthis reason, he goes on in the study of plants and then of animals. He\ncatalogues their species, and explains the apparatus of organs which\neach animal species is provided with. Since organs alone are not\nsufficient to explain animal life, man feels the need to introduce a\nfurther principle, which is the soul. Nevertheless, the soul is not a\nprinciple sufficient to explain man, since the actions of man reveal\nthemselves to be more powerful than the acts of the soul. The soul is\nnot enough to explain the highest degree of substantiality reached by\nman: Aristotle found man with speech and speech proceeds from\nintellect or the intellectual principles and powers.\n\nThe human intellect is in potency and moves to act. All that which\npasses from potency to act necessitates an agent of the same species\nas the thing that must pass on to the act. The intellect as well,\ntherefore, in order to pass from potency to act, needs an active\nintellect which is always in act and never in potency. When\nman\u2019s intellect reaches its extreme perfection, it comes close\nin its substance to the substance of this active intellect. In its\nsearch for perfection, man\u2019s intellect tends to imitate the\nmodel of this intellect, since it is that which makes man substantial\nin so far as he is man. This intellect is also man\u2019s end because\nit is that which provides him with a principle and an example to\nfollow in tending to perfection, which consists in approximating\nhimself as far as it is possible to it. It is therefore his agent, his\nend, and his perfection. It is a principle in three different ways: as\nan agent, as an end, and as the perfection to which man tends. It is,\nhowever, a separate form with respect to man, a separate agent, and a\nseparate end.\n\nThe result of the enquiry undertaken leads to the conclusion that\nhuman nature, the human soul, and the capabilities and the acts of\nthese two, just like the capabilities of the practical intellect, are\nall finalized with respect to the perfection of the human intellect.\nNature, the soul, and the human intellect are, however, insufficient\nto attain perfection and it is not possible to leave out of\nconsideration the acts generated by volition and choice which depend\non the practical intellect. For this reason, therefore, these acts\nmust also become the object of investigation like all that which\nconstitutes human will. Desire and the things, which depend on sense\nand discernment\u2014which the other animals also possess\u2014on\nthe other hand, are neither human, nor useful for attaining\ntheoretical perfection. According to this criterion it is necessary to\nre-examine completely all the scientific fields already established in\nthe search for that which contributes to the attainment of perfection\nby man and that which, on the other hand, impedes this search.\n\nFinally \u2018Abd al-Latif mentions the Metaphysics saying\nthat in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics beings are investigated\naccording to a different method from that used in the science of\nnature. Unlike his Farabian source, al-Farabi\u2019s Philosophy\nof Plato and Aristotle, \u2018 as we know it, Abd al-Latif\nbegins to analyze the metaphysical science which has as its objects of\ninquiry the divine and noble things. He seems to mention the\npseudo-Theology of Aristotle, the paraphrastic selection from\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads (IV to VI) translated by \u2018Abd\nal-Masih ibn Nai\u2018ma al-Himsi and corrected by al-Kindi. He\nstates that Aristotle in the Theology (Kitab\nbi-utulugiyya) said that God created the terrestrial world for\nman and also created in man the intellect and dispersed it in his soul\nso that it might be a weapon which strengthens man to make him able to\nlive in the earth (i.e., practical intellect) and to investigate the\ncreation of the heavens and the earth and the wonders which are found\nin the heavens and on the earth (i.e., theoretical intellect). And he\nsays that God is provident and takes care of qualitatively better men\nand inspires them as a result of the mediation of the active intellect\neither through the way of meditation, or through the way of the\neffulgence of soul or through the way of revelation.\n\nOf course since men are different there are different forms of assent\nto the truth: the absolute certainty of the man who follows the\ndemonstrative way as indicated by Aristotle in the Posterior\nAnalytics and the persuasion produced by examples and images as\nindicated by Aristotle in the Rhetoric and the\nPoetics. Hence, philosophy comes into being in every man in\nthe way that is possible for him.\n\nFor \u2018Abd al-Latif, Plato and his disciple Aristotle pursue the\nsame purpose and the same end in their philosophical speculation, that\nis to say, the perfection of man as man, which both identify in\nknowledge of the truth of things. Moreover, they describe a system so\nperfect in its organic constitution and completeness that the\ngenerations following them are left with nothing but the task of\nstudying it in an attempt to understand their thought correctly. The\nexceptional nature of Plato and Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, says\n\u2018Abd al-Latif, has three causes: first, their philosophy is\nuseful in motivating one to study, second, for a long time they had\ninfluence in this field, and third, the absolute primacy of their\nphilosophy lies in their research into the causes from the more\ndistant to the closest to the object. This method of inquiry does not\nneed anything else and it is impossible to confute. It is therefore a\ngreat mistake to believe that the works of the Moderns are clearer,\nmore useful, or qualitatively superior with respect to those of the\nAncients.\n3. Criticisms against the Moderns \n\nAbd al-Latif constantly held authors defined by him as Moderns\ndistinct from the Ancients and he unleashed a harsh polemic attack\nagainst the works of the former. His privileged targets were Avicenna\nand Fakhr al-Din al-Razi whom he considered, as far as it was\npossible, even worse than Avicenna. The writings of these authors in\nfact, if compared with those of the Ancients, reveal their low\nscientific level, are confused, and lack detailed analysis.\n3.1 Against Avicenna\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif makes a series of criticisms on Avicenna\u2019s\nphilosophy (Martini Bonadeo 2013; Ben Ahmed 2019). In the first place,\nhe explains that Avicenna did not manage to present an exhaustive\nphilosophical system in which every field of philosophical research\ncould receive adequate treatment. \u2018Abd al-Latif criticizes\nAvicenna\u2019s lack of reflection on the practical field. Even in\nhis most famous summa, the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, Avicenna\nneglected the contents of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics, and his Politics.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif explains this omission as a total lack of\nfamiliarity by Avicenna not only of practical philosophy, but also of\nphilosophy in general.\n\nIn the second place, according to \u2018Abd al-Latif, Avicenna seems\nto have distorted or not to have had any knowledge of the fundamental\nAristotelian epistemological criterion according to which research\nmust begin with that which is more easily knowable to us (cf.\nAristotle, Physics I.1, 184a16\u201321; Nicomachean\nEthics I.4, 1095b3\u20134). This is why, for example Avicenna\nmistakenly placed zoology after his treatment of the soul.\n\nNext, \u2018Abd al-Latif points out that Avicenna has produced\nnumerous works, which have been copied from one another, as in the\ncase of the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019 and the Kitab\nal-Najat. He observes that Avicenna decided to introduce all his\ntreatises with the discourse presented by Aristotle at the beginning\nof the Posterior Analytics (ll, 71a1\u20133) on every form\nof knowledge. But this is all that Avicenna knows of the Posterior\nAnalytics. In fact, he has not dealt with what constitutes the\nend of logic, that is to say, the five logical arts which are the\nobject of the Posterior Analytics, the Topics, the\nSophistical Refutations, the Rhetoric, and the\nPoetics, and he has dwelt on an analysis of the contents of\nthe Isagoge, Categories, De Interpretatione\nand Prior Analytics which, according to \u2018Abd al-Latif,\nconstitute a preparatory introduction to true logic. Even the\nKitab al-Shifa\u2019, which deals with logic at greater\nlength, presents a confused discourse. \u2018Abd al-Latif provides\nexamples which strengthen his strong criticism. In the first place it\nis surprising to him that Avicenna has not clarified the category of\n\u201chaving\u201d (\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd; for\nits Arabic translations see Afnan 1964: 89\u201390). But, in fact, in\nthe section on the categories (al-Maqulat) of the Kitab\nal-Shifa\u2019, Avicenna devotes few words to his explanation of\nthe meaning and the value of this category. He maintains that it is\nnot a clear category and recognizes that he has not managed to\nunderstand it because he does not see how it can contain species.\nMoreover, \u2018Abd al-Latif is amazed by the fact that Avicenna\nplaces the movement of the sky in the category of\n\u201cBeing-in-a-position\u201d\n(\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9), even\nthough he himself has written a book on the De Caelo et mundo\nand on the Physics. The category of\n\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 is\nexplained by Avicenna both in the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019 and\nthe Kitab al-Najat as the manner of being of the body in as\nfar as the fact that its parts constitute, one with another, a\nrelation of inclination and parallelism in relation to the directions\nand the parts of the place, if the body is in a place, such as, for\nexample standing up and sitting down. \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s\nthird criticism is of Avicenna\u2019s claim that he can define one of\ntwo relative terms without having recourse to the other. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif stresses that in the Isagoge Avicenna defines genus\nseparately and species separately and father separately and son\nseparately. Then in his definition of father as a \u201cliving thing\nwhich creates from his sperm another living thing similar to\nhim\u201d Avicenna finds himself obliged to seek recourse to four\ndistinct relations.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif proceeds to criticize Avicenna\u2019s theory of\nthe syllogism and in particular his admission of the hypothetical\nsyllogisms. Finally, \u2018Abd al-Latif makes a series of further\ncriticisms of Avicenna without, however, going into each of them in\ndetail. Avicenna has enlarged the book of the Poetics with an\namount of material which actually derives from the Rhetoric.\nSince Avicenna\u2019s Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, despite its\nnumerous errors, has become the philosophical encyclopedia of\nreference among \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s contemporaries, he\nbelieves that Avicenna is the indirect cause of the vast spread of\nphilosophical errors, such as the confusing, for example, the object\nproper to the Physics, that is, nature, with that of the\nMetaphysics.\n3.2 Against Fakhr al-Din al-Razi\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif presents two sets of reasons why al-Razi\u2018s\nworks, full of errors, should not be the object of people\u2019s\nadmiration. In the first place this writer does not possess a specific\ntechnical knowledge of the various sciences which he has decided to\nconsider: his use of the medical terminology is inaccurate, for\nexample, in his notes on Avicenna\u2019s Canon. In the\nsecond place, since he lacks any didactic method, he simply raises\ncontinual sophisms. For these reasons, \u2018Abd al-Latif maintains\nthat he should not even try to take on the holy text of the\nKoran as he did in his commentary on sura 112 or on sura 95\nand sura 87 (Gannag\u00e9 2011: 227\u2013256; Stern 1962:\n57\u201359).\n4. Metaphysics\n4.1 Metaphysics as Research into the Causes and First Philosophy\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s main work, the Book on the Science of\nMetaphysics, is survived in two manuscripts: the first, the ms.\nCairo, Dar al-kutub, Ahmad Taymur Pasha Hikma 117, 16\u2013178,\nwhich was probably produced in Egypt in 1529; the second ms Instanbul,\nS\u00fcleymaniye K\u00fct\u00fcphanesi, Carullah 1279, fols 140v-187v,\nwhich was produce around 1477 in Sa\u2019da in Yemen by a bookseller\nand copyst Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Nihmi (d. after 1480) who collected\nin it 40 different texts of philosophy for his personal use (Rosenthal\n1955; Griffel 2023).\n\nIn the twenty-four chapters of his Book on the Science of\nMetaphysics \u2018Abd al-Latif paraphrases and summarizes a sort\nof \u201clibrary\u201d of treatises on metaphysics (Zimmermann 1986)\nwhich were assimilated in the formative period of falsafa and\nimposed themselves to the point of becoming canonical. The editorial\nplan of the Book on the Science of Metaphysics follows the\nordering of the metaphysical and divine science according to\nal-Farabi\u2019s Enumeration of the Sciences. It consists in\nfact of three distinct parts which reflect al-Farabi\u2019s\ntripartite division: in the first part, which includes the first four\nchapters, there is the study of beings and their accidents; the second\npart, which goes from chapter five to chapter twelve, deals with the\nprinciples of definition and demonstration; the third and last part,\ncomprising chapters thirteen to twenty-four, is devoted to a\ndescription of the hierarchy of the immaterial and intelligible\nrealities until it reaches the First Mover, the First Principle, the\nFirst Cause, the One, which is nothing but the one God of the\nKoran, the provident Creator, in a synthesis of Aristotelian\nmetaphysics, Neoplatonic metaphysics, and Islamic monotheism (Neuwirth\n1976).\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif devotes a full sixteen out of twenty-four chapters\nto a discussion of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, which he\nprobably knew in more than one translation. The books of the\nMetaphysics he freely paraphrases are, in order, Alpha\nElatton/Alpha Meizon, Beta, Delta,\nGamma, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta,\nTheta, Iota, and Lambda (Neuwirth 1976,\n1977\u201378; Martini Bonadeo 2001, 2010, 2013, 2018; Ajoun 2017).\nThree whole chapters (13\u201315) are devoted to the latter one.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif is strongly influenced by Themistius\u2019\nparaphrase (Brague 1999) in his reading of Lambda. The\npresentation of Lambda ends with an entire chapter (16)\ncontaining an epitome of Alexander Arabus\u2019s treatise On the\nprinciples of the Universe (Badawi 1947; Genequand 2001; Endress\n2002; Ajoun 2017). \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s use of the\nMetaphysics reflects that of its first Arabic interpreters,\nin particular al-Kindi, who centered on the contents of books\nAlpha Elatton, Epsilon, and Lambda and was\ntied to the criterion of the doctrinal unity of Greek metaphysics: the\nnatural theology of Lambda is only a premise for a\ncharacterization of the First Principle, which is of clear Neoplatonic\norigin (D\u2019Ancona 1996).\n\nThis is particularly clear from the very beginning of the Book on\nthe Science of Metaphysics. For \u2018Abd al-Latif, in fact,\nthere are different causes for different kinds of being and different\nsciences for different causes, but there is one first science leading\nall the others, for two different reasons. First, as al-Farabi taught,\nit is able to demonstrate the principles of the other sciences,\nbecause it is only this science, which investigates absolute beings\nand from them it provides an explanation of the principles of the\nparticular sciences, comprised in it and below it. Second, this\nscience includes speculation about the First Principle, which every\nother thing needs in its own existence. \u2018Abd al-Latif claims\nthat this First Principle is the absolute final cause and that the\nscience of this cause is the wisdom (hikma) which precedes\nall other knowledge (Martini Bonadeo 2010; 2017a).\n\nThe First Principle is described by \u2018Abd al-Latif in a typical\nAvicennian phrase as the Pure Being (al-wujud al-mujarrad),\nthe aim of everything, and the First mover immobile, pure act, eternal\nand everlasting, i.e., the First Principle whose knowledge is the end\nof our inquiry. The First mover not only produces the movement of the\nthings, but it is their perfection, namely the paradigmatic cause, and\ntheir final cause. Abd al-Latif introduces the example of the law,\nwhich he derives from Themistius\u2019 paraphrase (on Abd al-Latif\u2019s use of\nThemistius\u2019 Paraphrase of Book Lambda of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics: Meyrav 2019). The law\nmoves politics in so far as it is chosen for itself. The First\nPrinciple, as God, is the cause for being of the worlds and their\nordering according to their beauty and their duration and it is a\nsubstance which equals his science. The First Principle is also\ndescribed as the True One (al-wahid al-haqq), one by essence,\nwithout any kind of multiplicity. The way to know this True One is to\nascend from the things which have some degree of unity. So we say one\narmy, one city, that Zayd is one, that the celestial sphere is one,\nand that the world is one. Then we proceed through souls and\nintellects, and through the things which in this ascent loose\nmultiplicity and acquire unity until we reach the Absolute One\n(al-wahid al-mutlaq), the architectural principle of\neverything and the supreme intelligible which makes the world be,\npreserves its existence, and orders it. The First Cause is for\n\u2018Abd al-Latif that cause which has within it all things in\npurely Neoplatonic vein. It is not surprising therefore that in\nparaphrasing chapter 10 of Lambda he speaks of emanation from\nthe First Principle.\n\nThe characteristics of the Neoplatonic One are thus grafted onto the\nAristotelian characterization of the First Principle. The point of\nfusion lies in the doctrine of the self-reflection of divine thought,\nwhich for \u2018Abd al-Latif, who is influenced by the exegesis of\nThemistius, is not a reason for composition and multiplicity within\nthe First Principle, as it was for Plotinus. If the thinking\nprinciple, the act of thinking and the object of thought coincide in\nthe First Principle, which by now is called God, there is in It no\nmultiplicity.\n4.2 Providence\n\nThe exposition of Lambda is followed by three chapters which\ndiscuss the theme of Providence\n(\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) of the First Principle.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s main source is Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019 De Providentia (Ruland 1976, 1979;\nZimmermann 1986; Thillet 2003; Martini Bonadeo 2017a). \u2018Abd\nal-Latif therefore mutually harmonizes two solutions which are in\nreality quite different from one another, not to say alternative: that\nput forward by Alexander regarding the problem of divine\nprovidence\u2014the First Principle thinks and knows primarily only\nitself, but it eternally knows the events of the world too, subject to\nbecoming, in so far as it exercises its own direction over them\nthrough the celestial order\u2014and that of Themistius, which\n\u2018Abd al-Latif had already made his own in the course of his\nparaphrase of Lambda, whereby God knows that which is\ndifferent from him without for this reason coming out of himself,\nsince he contains in him all the ideas of all things, and is the norm\nand the condition of the intelligibility of the world.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif maintains that the action of God\u2019s\nprovidence expresses itself both in the superior and in the inferior\nworld; but if in the first case the relationship between divine\nprovidence and the superior world is immediate, in the second case it\nis mediated by the superior world. The relationship between divine\nprovidence and those who receive it, however, cannot be thought of as\na causal relationship, since in this case \u201cthe noble would come\ninto being because of the ignoble and the earlier because of the\nlater\u201d (Rosenthal 1975: 156), which is shameful, nor can this\nrelationship be thought as purely accidental. Both situations are\nunsuitable for the First Principle, which cannot therefore exercise\nprovidence as its primary action, but cannot either be considered as\nthat from which providence derives accidentally. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nthen affirms that the existence and the order of things derive from\nthe existence of God, who is absolute good and returns to the image of\nfire which warms everything: God concedes to all existing things as\nmuch good as they, for their proximity to him, are able to receive.\nThe bodies of the sublunary world are able to enjoy the potency which\nemanates from God and so they tend to move towards him. Among the\nexisting things of the sublunary world, man has been given the\ncapacity for reason, due to which he can carry out those actions that\nlead him to acquire the happiness appropriate to him. The same\nrational capacity allows him to know divine things and, in virtue of\nthis knowledge, man is superior to all other things that come to being\nand pass away. At times, however, he uses this rational capacity to\nobtain, not the good and virtues, but vices. This can happen because\nprovidence allows man the capacity to be able to acquire virtues, but\nthe success of this enterprise lies in the will and in the choice made\nby man himself.\n\nFollowing the lead of Alexander\u2019s treatise On\nProvidence, \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces the problem of evil\nand places his examination of those aspects of the doctrine of\nprovidence that regard man and his actions within the framework of a\ndiscussion more of a cosmological nature. For this reason, though he\nfavours Themistius\u2019 solution whereby God knows all things in\nthat he contains within him the ideas of all things, which he holds to\nbe closest to the dogma of the Koran, \u2018Abd al-Latif has recourse\nto Alexander concerning the problems of evil, man\u2019s free will,\nand divine justice.\n4.3 Intellect and First Cause\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif then proceeds in his treatise by epitomizing the\nBook of the Exposition of the Pure Good, that is to say, the\nLiber de causis of the Latin Middle Ages, proposition 54, on\nthe difference between eternity and time (Endress 1973; Jolivet 1979:\n55\u201375; Zimmermann 1994: 9\u201351) from Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology, Metaphysics Lambda, and the\npseudo-Theology (Martini Bonadeo 2017b, Ajoun 2017).\n\u2018Abd al-Latif reproduces all the propositions of the Liber\nde causis, except numbers 4, 10, 18, and 20, and follows the same\norder in which they are set out (Badawi 1955b; Anawati 1956:\n73\u2013110; Taylor 1984: 236\u2013248). Abd al-Latif\u2019s aim is to\nestablish, on a Farabian model, an identification between the First\nCause, One and Pure Good, as presented in the Liber de causis\nand the Aristotelian First Principle, Unmoved Mover and Intellect in\nactuality, described in his paraphrase of Metaphysics\nLambda.\n\nAbd al-Latif stresses the primacy of the most universal cause, which\nis, therefore, further from its effect with respect to the causes\nnearer to the effect and hence apparently more important. The First\nCause transcends any possibility of our knowledge. If knowing the true\nnature of things in fact means knowing their causes, since by\ndefinition the First Cause has no causes that precede it, it is\nunknowable in its true nature. It can only be known by approximation,\nthrough a description of the secondary causes. A long section, which\ndescribes intellect, follows this theory of the transcendent\nineffability of the First Cause which precludes any proper\npredication. The intellect is with eternity, above time, and is not\nsubject to division, because everything which is divisible is\ndivisible in magnitude, in number, or in motion, but all these kinds\nof division are under time. It is one, in so far as it is the first\nthing which originated from the First Cause, but it is multiple with\nrespect to the multiplicity of the gifts that come to it from the\nFirst Cause. The intellect knows what is above it\u2014the gifts that\ncome to it from the First Cause\u2014and what is below it\u2014the\nthings of which it is the cause. But intellect knows its cause and its\neffect through its substance, that is to say that it perceives things\nintellectually. It grasps intellectually either the intellectual\nthings or the sensible ones. The First Cause, which is the Pure Good,\npours all that is good into the intellect and into all that which\nexists through the mediation of the intellect. There is, however, a\ncertain fluctuation in \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s attempt to\nestablish a perfect conformity between the First Cause as presented in\nthe Liber de causis and the First Principle presented in his\nchapters devoted to the paraphrase of Metaphysics Lambda.\nAccording to \u2018Abd al-Latif God precedes the intellect in ruling\nthings: he orders the intellect to govern. But, having stated that the\nself-subsistent substance is not generated from something else,\n\u2018Abd al-Latif maintains that intellect does not need anything\nother than itself in its conceptualizing and formation\n(tasawwuri-hi wa taswiri-hi), that it is perfect and complete\neternally, and that it is the cause of itself.\n4.4 Metaphysical Science as of Science of Sovereignty\n\nAt this point \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces the description of the\nScience of Sovereignty (\u2018ilm al-rububiyya) which echoes\nthat of the first chapter in the Theology of Aristotle: it is\nnot a physical science that limits itself to ascend from effects to\ncauses, but a science which, when it comes close to causes, is able to\ngo back to consider the effects in greater depth approaching the\ndivine knowledge of things.\n\nMoreover, \u2018Abd al-Latif summarizes in the contents, but not in\nthe order, a selection of twenty propositions of Proclus (1\u20133,\n5, 62, 86, 15\u201317, 21, 54, 76, 78, 91, 79, 80, 167, and\n72\u201374: see Zimmermann 1986), four quaestiones of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (Van Ess 1966; Fazzo & Wiesner 1993) and\nthe adaptation of John Philoponus\u2019 De aeternitate mundi\ncontra Proclum IX,8 and IX,11 (Hasnawi 1994), entitled What\nAlexander of Aphrodisias Extracted from the Book of Aristotle Called\nTheology, Namely the Doctrine of Divine Sovereignty (Endress\n1973). In doing that \u2018Abd al-Latif sets for himself three\nobjectives. In the first place, he wants to stress the crucial aspects\nof the doctrine of the First Cause understood as One, presented in the\nprevious chapters. In the second place, he discusses the relationship\nbetween the One and the many, and, not by chance, he does so after a\nseries of chapters (16\u201320) devoted to the relationship between\nthe First Cause and the world. As for these two objectives, he\nstresses the basic features of the First Cause: it is One and it gives\nunity to that which is multiple; it is One in itself and the True One\nwithout composition; it is the cause of all that which is multiple in\nthat, although it is by essence One, its causal action propagates in a\nmultiplicity of effects; it is above eternity and time; it is life\nthat does not end, light that does not extinguish, it is Pure Being,\nit is the first agent, it is ineffable and nothing can be properly\npredicated of it, it is unknowable, the apex of the hierarchy of being\nwhich is composed of the intellect, intelligible realities, the Soul,\nthe souls, and, finally, the corporeal realities of nature. Then he\nturns to the providence of the First Cause with regard to its effects:\nthis providence exists, is mediated by the spheres and preserves the\nspecies on earth. The divine power acts upon the sublunary world by\ncontact, and, starting from the first sphere of fire, the divine power\nis in matter according to the receptivity of the various matters.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif ends his presentation of the metaphysical science\nby summarizing the text of the pseudo-Theology from chapter 2\nto chapter 10 (chapter nine is not included), more or less literally\n(Badawi 1955a, Ajoun 2017). Through the\npseudo-Theology\u2014as we have seen before, an item of the\nArabic Plotinus\u2014\u2018Abd al-Latif was exposed to a Neoplatonic\ndoctrine on the causality of the Platonic ideas which took into\naccount the Aristotelian themes of the immobile causality of the First\nMover and the coincidence of the nature of what is the supreme\nintelligent and what is the supreme intelligible. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nwrites about the First Principle, True One, and Creator, which is\nknown only through imperfect images and which is infinite in its\nessence, the process of emanation and the hierarchy from the First\nPrinciple to the word of coming to be, the nature and movement of the\ncelestial bodies which move out of the desire to imitate the\nperfection of the First Unmoved Mover and to assimilate themselves to\nthe Pure Good to the extent to which they are capable; the movement of\nthe first sphere and the life in the world of coming to be; the\nontological anteriority of the First Cause with respect to the\nproximate causes, the ascent of human soul from sensible to\nintellectual knowledge up to the First Principle, which is true\nintellect, true being, true perfection, true science and true\nsubstance. At the end he deals with the limits of our senses and of\nthe human intellect in understanding the First Cause and the others\nseparate beings: our intellect is weak in understanding concepts such\nas movement, time, matter, privation, and possibility, and it can\nattain them only through analogies and long meditation. Moreover, for\nour intellect the First Principle is the condition of knowing without\nbeing known by us, as the sun is the condition of our vision even\nthough we cannot bear the direct sight of it. The Book on the\nScience of Metaphysics ends with the announcement of a treatise\non political philosophy to follow, entitled The Conditions of the\nPerfect State and its Consequences: if people are educated to\ngrew up in virtues, it will be possible to realize al-madina\nal-fadila, the Farabian perfect state.\n\nThis overview of the reception and use of the Greek and Arabic sources\nby \u2018Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi in his Book on the Science of\nMetaphysics proves that, in the framework of al-Farabi\u2019s\nawareness of the manifold nature of metaphysics\u2014ontology,\nknowledge of causes, universal science, and divine science or\ntheology\u2014the return to the Ancients, and to Aristotle, declared\nby \u2018Abd al-Latif to be necessary in his biography, was certainly\nnot a return to the Aristotle of the Greek sources, linguistic access\nto which had by that time been lost for a couple of centuries. Rather\nit was a return to the Aristotle of his own tradition: that strongly\nNeoplatonized Aristotle of the origins of the Kindian\nfalsafa. \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s treatise on metaphysics\nis in fact deeply rooted in the whole set of Greek works on first\nphilosophy that had been translated or paraphrased into Arabic under\nthe impulse and direction of al-Kindi: in al-Kindi as in \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s project where the knowledge of the causes comes to\ncoincide with a natural theology that investigates the First\nPrinciple, the De Providentia of Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nProclus\u2019 Elements of Theology, and the last three of\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads constitute a natural development of\nbook Lambda of the Metaphysics.\n5. Good and bad Epistemologies and Practices\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s attitude towards contemporary medicine and\nthe practice of alchemy helps us understand his consideration for the\nepistemology of the sciences, which must be based on universal grounds\nas that of the Ancients, and it explains once more the primacy\n\u2018Abd al-Latif assigns to the philosophy of the Greeks which he\nconsidered the right way of thinking and therefore of acting.\n5.1 Medical Epistemology\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif in the first part of his above mentioned\nautobiographical work (Joosse 2011, 2014) focuses on the\nepistemological status of the art of medicine using different\ncomparisons which seem to be in contradiction: medicine is like both\nmathematics and the art of archery (Joosse & Pormann 2008).\nMedicine is an art concerned with universals. For this reason it does\nnot make errors. Mathematics is also a science which considers\nabstract concepts, but even in this theoretical science approximation\noccurs (the examples are that of the impossibility of squaring a\ncircle and the approximation in writing an irrational number).\nConcerning the physicians, they are like the expert in the art of\narchery \u201cwho hits the mark in most cases\u201d (Joosse 2014:\n66), but they can make mistakes because they are concerned with\nparticulars. Good physicians, even if they do not hit the target, do\nnot miss it entirely. For \u2018Abd al-Latif his contemporaries are\nlike those whose arrows which do not hit the targets, but on the\ncontrary, fall in the opposite direction (Joosse & Pormann\n2010).\n\nThe pitiful state of contemporary medicine, in contrast to the\nmedicine of the Ancients Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen, is caused\nfirst of all because the contemporaries do not follow a medical\nepistemology. \u2018Abd al-Latif observes that, even in antiquity,\nmedical sects had existed which taught false medicine. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif recalls, in particular, the Empirical and Methodist sects\nwhich were in opposition to the Dogmatic or Rationalist one, according\nto the classic tripartite division of medical schools which were known\nto Arabic authors due precisely to the Arabic translation of many\nintroductory works by Galen and pseudo-Galen. The Empirical sect of\nSceptical inspiration, in fact, was neither concerned to study the\nanatomical structure of the human body nor the internal secrets of\nillnesses. It rejected any possible analogy between the dead body and\nthe living body. It denied any general theory. The medicine which it\ntaught, therefore, translated itself into a medical practice totally\nalien to the anatomic-physiological basis of symptoms and was wholly\nlinked to clinical phenomena and the classification of symptoms and\nmedicines. The Methodist sect of Stoic and Epicurean inspiration, for\nwhich human life was the natural place for moral and physical\nsuffering, held that the human body was formed of atoms which could\nnot be perceived by the senses and which were in continual movement\nthrough pores and channels. According to this sect, illness came about\nin the case of an alteration in the quality and the movement of the\ncorpuscles or in the case of an excessive tightening or relaxing of\nthe pores through which the atoms moved. Therapy, therefore, was\nreduced to baths designed to provoke sweat in cases of the tightening\nof the pores and astringents and tonics in the case of dilation, in\norder to return to an intermediate perviousness. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nholds that the above sects are far removed from the medicine practiced\nby the Dogmatic doctors of Platonic and Aristotelian inspiration who\nconsidered anatomy and physiology to be the basic sciences and for\nwhom the detailed study of the internal causes of an illness was\nprimary and necessary. Nevertheless, the criteria followed by the\nEmpirical and the Methodist sects were thus far scientific: the\nphysicians followed a theory and did not proceed by pure and simple\nsupposition, as most contemporary physicians did (Joosse & Pormann\n2010).\n\nIn \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s opinion, the medicine of his age must\nrediscover and apply Greek medicine with its principles, descriptions\nof diseases, and therapies. Greek theoretical medicine is concerned\nwith universals and is founded on the ground of universal principles\nwhich are valid everywhere. In this respect, according to him, Greek\nmedicine is far superior to his contemporaries\u2019 practice and\nmust be learned by the physicians of his age according to the\nprinciple of accumulation of knowledge which also guides \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s philosophical project.\n5.2 Against Alchemy\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif was profoundly averse to alchemy, which was much\nin vogue in his time (Wiedeman 1907; Joosse 2008, 2014: 29\u201362).\nIt can in no way be placed in the system of the sciences. It is a\ncomplete fraud: the false alchemists are all engaged in the production\nof elixirs or the \u201cPhilosophers\u2019 stone\u201d. They\nbelieve\n\n\nin the substantial transmutation of metals and thought that the\n\u201cdifferentia specifica\u201d of metals could be produced during\nan artificial process, which in the end would always lead to the\ntransformation of lead and other base metals into precious metals gold\nand silver. (Joosse 2008: 304)\n\n\nAlchemy and its false presumptions must be distinguished from\nscientific knowledge, such as mathematics, mineralogy, chemistry,\nzoology, and botany. Proof of this is that the Ancients never spoke of\nit: Pythagoras has not devoted a treatise to it, Plato and Aristotle\nnever speak of it, and thus neither do the Greek commentators after\nthem. There is not a single word on alchemy in all of Galen\u2019s\nvoluminous works, nor in that of John Philoponus. In the Islamic age\nal-Jahiz, Hunayn ibn Ishaq, his son Ishaq, his grandson Hunayn, Abu\nBishr Matta, and Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Tayyib keep all silent on the\nsubject. The father of this false science would seem to have been\nJabir ibn Hayyan who has turned generations of students after him\nastray. Al-Farabi, the greatest Islamic philosopher, mentions elixirs\n(al-iksir) in a highly negative way only once. Even Avicenna,\nin his treatise on alchemy does not give this art a rational basis.\nAlchemy is guilty of having waylaid generations of scholars.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s life and works testifies the crucial role\nplayed by many Muslim men of learning and science, who attended the\nmilieus of the Islamic schools between the 12th and\n13th centuries, in the transmission of the Greek\nphilosophical and medical knowledge, still perceived as essential to\nthe training of the learned Muslim.\n",
