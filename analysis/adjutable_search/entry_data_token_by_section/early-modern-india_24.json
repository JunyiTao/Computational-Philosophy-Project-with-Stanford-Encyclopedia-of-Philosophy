    "main_text": "Logical Theory and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Analysis of Inferential Warrant (vy\u0101pti) || Overview of Logical Theory\n8.1 Overview of Logical Theory\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i is\ndivided into four parts, one for each of the four knowledge-sources or\npram\u0101\u1e47as recognised by the Ny\u0101ya school. The\npost-Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba scholars focused more and more exclusively on\nthe second part, concerning inference, and wrote increasingly detailed\ncommentaries on a comparatively small portion of the book, namely the\npart where Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba examines the relation between\ninferential sign and property-to-be-inferred, which is called the\nvy\u0101pti, \u2018pervasion\u2019 or\n\u2018inference-warranting\u2019 relation (Ingalls 1951, Goekoop\n1977, Wada 2007). Even today, in a traditional Indian education, study\nof these sub-commentaries on various subsections of the\nvy\u0101pti section of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba forms an essential\npart of the curriculum.\n\nThe general structure of a properly formulated Ny\u0101ya inference\nhas three components: thesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the \u2018locus\u2019 (pak\u1e63a) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (s\u0101dhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred. Thus every Ny\u0101ya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it has\nH; e.g. d. For example, \u201cThe mountain ( =\np) has fire (= S), because it has smoke ( =\nH); e.g. the kitchen ( = d)\u201d. A sound argument must\nfulfil at least three criteria: (i) the reason property must be\nuncontroversially present in the locus; (ii) the reason property and\nthe inferred property must be appropriately related, roughly such that\nwherever the reason is present, so is the inferred property; (iii) the\nexample must be an uncontroversial place where both the reason\nproperty and the inferred property are present.\n\nCertain topics concerning this account are addressed in The Manual\nof Reason and other Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts. Among them are: the\nconditions under which inference can take place, and the conditions\nunder which the result is a knowledge-episode (TS 49, 54); the correct\naccount of the inference-warranting relation, between the inferential\nsign and the property-to-be-inferred, called the\n\u2018pervasion\u2019 or \u2018vy\u0101pti\u2019 relation\n(TS 50); the distinction between inference and demonstration\n(sv\u0101rtha- and par\u0101rtha- inference) (TS 52,\n53); the three-fold classification of inference types, those which are\n\u2018universally positive\u2019 (keval\u0101nvayin), those\nwhich are \u2018universally negative\u2019\n(kevala-vyatirekin), and those which are combined positive\nand negative (anvaya-vyatirekin) (TS 55); the types of\ninferential fallacy (hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa) (TS\n57\u201364).\n\nI will discuss mainly the definition of the \u2018pervasion\u2019\nrelation. First, however, a brief note on how the causal model of\nknowledge is applied to inference. The \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause (kara\u1e47a) of an inferential cognition\nis said to be the inferrer\u2019s knowledge of the relevant pervasion\nrelation. The \u2018operative condition\u2019\n(vy\u0101p\u0101ra) is said to be an awareness that the locus\nof inference (p) possesses such an inferential sign\n(h) as is pervaded by the property inferred (s).\nThis is, in effect, an awareness which combines the two premises of\nthe argument together immediately prior to the conclusion being\nderived, and is called the \u2018par\u0101mar\u015ba\u2019\nor \u2018consideration\u2019. The \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019\nor \u2018causal factor responsible for the truth\u2019 of the\ninferential cognition is the condition that this\n\u2018consideration\u2019 be true, i.e. that the locus does in fact\npossess such a sign as is pervaded by the inferred property. Another\nauxiliary causal factor is that the inferrer must either not yet\nalready know the conclusion or else must have a particular desire to\ninfer (i.e. given, knowledge of the premises, the inference would\nnormally take place mechanically, but if the conclusion is already\nknown e.g. perceptually, then the inferrer has to have a special wish\nto re-establish it inferentially). This condition is known as\n\u2018pak\u1e63a\u1e6d\u0101\u2019, and should not to be\nconfused with \u2018pak\u1e63adharmat\u0101\u2019, which\nis the name of condition (i) above.\n",
