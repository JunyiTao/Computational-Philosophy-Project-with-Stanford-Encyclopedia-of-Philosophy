    "main_text": "Some related terms || Epistemic relativism\n7. Unity in diversity\n\nKuhn observed that although his own and Popper\u2019s criteria of\ndemarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the\nsame conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively\npseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically\ndivergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon.\nPhilosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their\nviews on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in\nthe community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of\ndemarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that\ncreationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing,\nufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian\ncatastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There\nare a few points of controversy, for instance concerning the status of\nFreudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus\nrather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.\n\nIt is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached\nin particular issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the\ngeneral criteria that these judgments should presumably be based upon.\nThis puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important\nphilosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and\npseudoscience.\n\nPhilosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other\ninteresting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between\nscience and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such\nas that between science and religion, the relationship between science\nand reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday\nknowledge), the scope for justifiable simplifications in science\neducation and popular science, the nature and justification of\nmethodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the\nmeaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural\nphenomenon. Several of these problem areas have as yet not received\nmuch philosophical attention.\n",
