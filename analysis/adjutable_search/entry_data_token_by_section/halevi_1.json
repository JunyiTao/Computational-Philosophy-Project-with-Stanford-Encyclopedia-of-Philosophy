    "main_text": "The Frame Story of the Kuzari and Its Setting\n2. The Frame Story of the Kuzari and Its Setting\n\n\nHalevi introduces the dialogue by assuming the voice of an\nanonymous narrator. This figure identifies the overall concern of the\nensuing discussions by indicating that he had been asked about whatever\nargumentation he had against those who differ or take issue with the\nJews, naming as examples the philosophers generally, the adherents of\nthe other major religions of the time (Christianity and Islam), and\nthose who have seceded from the great majority of Jews because of their\ndifferences with them. Among the latter, it is likely that the Karaites\nwere foremost in his mind. The narrator then establishes the context of\nthe dialogue by recalling what he had heard of the arguments used by a\nJewish sage approximately four hundred years earlier that persuaded the\nking of the Khazars to adopt the Jewish religion based on testimony\nrecorded in historical chronicles of the time. This recollection leads\ndirectly to the frame story on which all that follows is\npredicated.\n\nAccording to this story, the king repeatedly dreams the same dream, in\nwhich an angel appears to address him saying, \u201cYour intention is\npleasing to God, but your actions are not pleasing\u201d (K 1:1).\nNotwithstanding the king's efforts to respond to its message through\ndiligence in presiding over the established forms of Khazar worship\nand his sincere intent in doing so, the dream continued to come with\nthe same disturbing message. This unexpected result eventually\nprompted him to examine the various religions and sects; after doing\nso, both he and the majority of the Khazars converted to Judaism. At\nthis point, the narrator observes that some of the arguments\nof the unnamed Jewish scholar that prompted the king to convert were\nalso persuasive to him and in accord with his own belief. Indeed, he\nthought he should record this argumentation \u201cjust as it took\nplace,\u201d adding, \u201cThe intelligent will understand,\u201d a\nbiblical citation from Daniel 12:10 (K 1:1).\n\n\nThis remark, \u201cThe intelligent will understand,\u201d can be\ninterpreted in various ways. According to some, it indicates that the\nargumentation presented in the dialogue must have been taken from the\nBook of Histories, which the narrator also mentioned.\nOthers, however, maintain that it hints at the entire dialogue being a\nliterary fiction. Still, others have suggested that it points to the\nfact that the dialogue may have been intended for very different kinds\nof readers and thus written on at least two levels. According to this\nlast interpretation, the Kuzari is addressed on one level to\nthe multitude of Jews in order to reinforce both their traditional\nopinions and their adherence to the forms of religious observance\nestablished by the Talmudic sages.  However, on a second level, it is\naddressed to those more inclined towards exercising independent\njudgment in the conduct of life, such as members of the courtier\nclass, philosophers, and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with a\nview to providing instruction on how to live responsibly within their\nown community. These interpretations are by no means exhaustive, but\ncollectively they suggest that Halevi's intentions should not be taken\nas transparently obvious either in the dialogue as a whole or even in\nspecific exchanges between its interlocutors. Not even the narrator,\nwho comes closest to speaking for Halevi himself, admits to being\npersuaded by all of the Jewish sage's arguments.  Accordingly, the\nintelligent reader is expected to follow the arguments and actions of\nthe dialogue with a view to analyzing and identifying the spoken and\nunspoken assumptions of each speaker, the function of metaphors,\nanalogies, and even oaths, the types and relative cogency of the\narguments presented, and the significance of reformulations of earlier\nstatements by the same speaker, if he or she is to understand what is\nrecorded and how it might ultimately change one's life.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is helpful to consider briefly what Halevi\ndiscloses about the Khazar king himself as the \u201coriginal\u201d\naddressee of the arguments presented. As a reigning monarch, he is,\nabove all, a man of action who is naturally concerned with correct\nactions in all of the many areas in which such judgments are made. His\nprincipal responsibility is to govern his people so that they will\nsurvive and surmount any threats to their existence\u2014internal or\nexternal\u2014and ultimately prosper in the long run. Insofar as he\nalso has priestly responsibilities, he is also concerned with pious\nactions. Yet as a pious pagan, he stands outside and apart from the\nthree revealed religions. This might qualify him as a detached and\nimpartial judge of what they have to teach, but it also suggests that\nhe is disposed to be skeptical about their claims to possess a\nrevelation from God. Beyond this, he is inclined to disdain Jews\nbecause of their despised condition and lowly estate. In general, he\nplaces a high premium on what can be learned from experience and\nproves himself ready to act upon what he learns.  However, to the\nextent that his openness to experience also includes religious\nexperience, he emerges as a divided man whose natural piety is at odds\nwith his skeptical inclinations.\n",
