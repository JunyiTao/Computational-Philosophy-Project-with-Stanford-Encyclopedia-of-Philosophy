    "main_text": "Cambridge Analysis\n3. Cambridge Analysis\n\nBy her own account, Stebbing was \u201cconverted\u201d to analytic\nphilosophy when she encountered G. E. Moore for the first time at a\nmeeting in London:\n\n\nIn 1917 I read a paper to the Aristotelian Society [entitled\n\u201cRelation and Coherence\u201d], perhaps one of the most muddled\npapers that have ever been presented to that assembly. \u2026 At the\noutset of the discussion \u2026 a man whom I had never seen and took\nto be quite young, began to ask me questions with a vehement\ninsistence that considerably alarmed me. \u201cWhat ON EARTH do you\nmean by that?\u201d he exclaimed again and again, thumping the table\nas he said \u201con earth\u201d in a manner that clearly shewed he\nbelieved there was no earthly meaning in what I had said. Soon,\nhowever, my alarm faded; the vehement philosopher had made me forget\nnot to be a philosopher\u2014nothing mattered except trying to find\nout what I did mean. In spite of my stumbling replies he managed to\nelicit the reasons why I had been led to the views I was trying to\ndefend; he shewed me the baselessness of many of my reasons, he\nunravelled the muddles and enabled me to see more clearly the grain of\nsense that had been at the back of my inept criticisms. That was my\nfirst meeting with Moore, whose name I discovered only towards the end\nof the discussion. I am inclined to think that this meeting of the\nAristotelian Society was somewhat peculiar in the annals of the\nSociety, for the reader of a paper was, before the end of the\ndiscussion, convinced that her main contentions were entirely wrong.\nOne does not expect a philosophical society\u2019s meeting to end in\na conversion, yet such was the result in my case, owing mainly to the\nvehement and vigorous clarity of Moore and his patience in pursuing\nthe question to its end \u2026 (1942: 530)\n\n\nStebbing kept in touch with Moore for the rest of her life,\ncorresponding and meeting regularly in Cambridge. Chapter IX of A\nModern Introduction to Logic, for example, was revised for the\nsecond edition in the light of criticisms she received from Moore, as\nshe notes in its preface (1933b: vii).\n\nOne fundamental idea that Stebbing took over from Moore was the\ndistinction between understanding a proposition and knowing its\nanalysis. Moore had appealed to this distinction in arguing in\n\u201cA Defence of Common Sense\u201d (1925), for example, that one\ncan know, with certainty, that various \u201ccommon sense\u201d\npropositions, such as that one exists, has a body, is a human being,\nand so on, are true even if one cannot give the analysis of them. All\nthat is necessary to know that these propositions are true is to\nunderstand them (understand their meaning, as Moore put it). Indeed,\nMoore argued, one could not even raise the question of its correct\nanalysis (or judge the correctness of any analysis that was offered)\nif one did not understand the proposition in the first place. This\ndistinction is also fundamental to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus, though whether it was Wittgenstein who influenced\nMoore or Moore (in earlier thinking) who influenced Wittgenstein\ncannot be discussed here. Whatever their mutual influence, however,\nthe distinction became central to the conception of analysis that was\ncharacteristic of what came to be known as the Cambridge School of\nAnalysis, whose members included John Wisdom and Austin Duncan-Jones\nas well as Moore and Stebbing. It also included, or at least was\ninfluenced by the ideas of, Bertrand Russell, Frank P. Ramsey and C.\nD. Broad. (For further details, see Baldwin 2013.)\n\nIn 1932 Stebbing read another paper to the Aristotelian Society\nentitled \u201cThe Method of Analysis in Metaphysics\u201d, in which\nshe sought to spell out and justify the presuppositions of the\nconception of analysis of the Cambridge School. She identifies three\nmain assumptions, which she formulates as follows (1932: 85):\n\n(1)\nIf p [standing for any proposition] is to be analysed,\nthen p must be understood. It follows that there is at least\none expression which unambiguously expresses p.\n(2)\nIf p is to be analysed, then it is not always the case\nthat p is known to be false, and it is sometimes the case\nthat p is known to be true. \n(3)\nDirectional analysis is possible. \n\n\nThe first, which she characterizes as logical, she defends by\nappealing to Moore\u2019s distinction between understanding a\nproposition and knowing its analysis, making explicit the\npresupposition that if one can understand a proposition, then there\nmust be some unambiguous formulation of it. The second, which she\ndescribes as metaphysical (though it is also epistemological),\nexpresses the further\u2014Moorean\u2014assumption that any process\nof analysis must take it as granted that the proposition we are\nseeking to analyse can be known to be true. Stebbing here merely\nstates that the assumption is plausible and that she has no reasons to\nreject it (1932: 92).\n\nThe third assumption gives her the most difficulty, however. She\ndivides it into a number of more specific presuppositions, but what is\ncrucial is the assumption that analysis must be \u201cdirected\u201d\ntowards, i.e., end in, what she calls \u201cbasic\nfacts\u201d\u2014absolutely simple or atomic facts. Just such an\nassumption was made in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus as well\nas in Russell\u2019s form of logical atomism, for example. But once\nStebbing has made explicit all these presuppositions, she comes to the\nconclusion that not only are they unjustified but they are not even\nvery plausible (1932: 86\u20137).\n\nTo illustrate the conception of metaphysical analysis that Stebbing is\nseeking to articulate, let us consider one of Stebbing\u2019s\nexamples:\n\n(1)\n Every economist is fallible.\n\n\nLet us suppose that we need to give some unambiguous formulation of\nthis. Here is one possibility:\n\n(2)\nFor all x,if x is an economist, then x is fallible.\n\n\nWe can see this as providing a logical analysis of (1). It could be\nreadily formalized in the predicate calculus as \n\n\\[ (\\forall x) (Ex \\rightarrow Fx) \\]\n\n\nBut what is its metaphysical analysis? One suggestion might be that\nthe analysis of (1) ends in a conjunction of propositions expressing\nthe specific facts about the fallibility of each economist:\n\n(3)\nKarl Marx is fallible and John Maynard Keynes is fallible and\nMuhammad Yunus is fallible and \u2026 \n\n\nIt seems clear that we can understand (1) without knowing the\nsuggested analysis expressed in (3), so to this extent the Moorean\ndistinction seems justified. To understand (3), taken as elliptical\nfor the full conjunction, I would need to know the names of all the\neconomists, and this is something that very few\u2014if any\u2014of\nus know. But if this is right, then can we really say that (3)\nanalyses the \u201cmeaning\u201d of (1), which is how Moore seemed\nto want to put it? Does (1) have the same \u201cmeaning\u201d as\n(3)? Even if we take (1) as an abbreviation of the (full) conjunction\nexpressed in (3), would we not at the very least have to add at the\nend \u201cand that is all the economists there are\u201d? And how\nshould this last clause be analysed? What kind of fact does that\nexpress? In any case, can \u201cfacts\u201d such as that Keynes is\nfallible, etc., be regarded as \u201cbasic\u201d? Can they not be\nanalysed further? (3) was only offered as one suggestion, natural as\nit might have seemed. Are there not other possible analyses, taking a\nrather different form? Might the truth (if such it is) of (1) not be\ngrounded, instead, in facts about the nature of being an\neconomist\u2014that economists have to idealize situations and hence\nare bound to get some things wrong, for example?\n\nThere is room for argument, then, as to what the\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d analysis of a proposition such as (1) is;\nand in the early 1930s members of the Cambridge School did indeed\ndebate the issue of the analysis of a whole range of types of\nproposition in great detail. Stebbing was at the centre of this\ndebate. A distinction came to be drawn between logical and\nmetaphysical analysis in just the way we have outlined: logical\nanalysis was intended to give an \u201cunambiguous\u201d formulation\nand metaphysical analysis was intended to uncover the \u201cbasic\nfacts\u201d on which the meaning or truth of the proposition to be\nanalysed was grounded. Logical analysis was alternatively described as\n\u201csame-level\u201d analysis and metaphysical analysis as\n\u201cnew-level\u201d or \u201creductive\u201d or\n\u201cdirectional\u201d analysis.\n\nOnce this distinction is drawn, it becomes possible to reject\nmetaphysical analysis without rejecting analysis altogether. We can\nallow logical analysis to provide us with\n\u201cunambiguous\u201d\u2014or at least clearer\u2014formulations\nof the proposition we want to analyse. This may be sufficient to\nelucidate its logical form or to remove certain confusions to which it\nmay give rise. This is what Max Black (1933), for example, advocated\nin a reply to Stebbing that he also read to the Aristotelian Society a\nfew months later (see Beaney 2003). We can also allow\n\u201cpartial\u201d metaphysical analyses. We might\n\u201creduce\u201d propositions about the decisions of committees,\nfor example, to propositions about the activities of its constituent\nmembers, which may be enough to explain the decisions that were made\nwithout having to further analyse what it is to be a member of a\ncommittee or indeed what it is to be a person (rational or otherwise).\nThe correctness or usefulness of an analysis is relative to our\npurposes in seeking it. This purpose-relative approach to analysis was\nthe one that Stebbing herself came to adopt. (For more on the debates\nabout analysis in the 1930s, see Baldwin 2013; Beaney 2003, 2016.)\n",
