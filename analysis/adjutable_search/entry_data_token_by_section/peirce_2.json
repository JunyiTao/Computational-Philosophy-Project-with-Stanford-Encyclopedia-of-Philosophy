    "main_text": "Deduction, Induction, and Abduction\n3. Deduction, Induction, and Abduction\n\n\nPrior to about 1865, thinkers on logic commonly had divided arguments\ninto two subclasses: the class of deductive arguments (a.k.a.\nnecessary inferences) and the class of inductive arguments (a.k.a.\nprobable inferences). About this time, Peirce began to hold that there\nwere two utterly distinct classes of probable inferences, which he\nreferred to as inductive inferences and abductive inferences (which he\nalso called hypotheses and retroductive inferences). Peirce reached\nthis conclusion by entertaining what would happen if one were to\ninterchange propositions in the syllogism AAA-1 (Barbara): All\nMs are Ps; all Ss are Ms;\ntherefore, all Ss are Ps. This valid syllogism\nPeirce accepted as representative of deduction. But he also seemed\ntypically to regard it in connection with a problem of drawing\nconclusions on the basis of taking samples. For let us regard being\nan M as being a member of a population of some sort, say\nbeing a ball of the population of balls in some particular urn. Let us\nregard P as being some property a member of this population\ncan have, say being red. And, finally, let us regard being\nan S as being a member of a random sample taken from this\npopulation. Then our syllogism in Barbara becomes: All balls in this\nurn are red; all balls in this particular random sample are taken from\nthis urn; therefore, all balls in this particular random sample are\nred. Peirce regarded the major premise here as being the Rule, the\nminor premise as being the particular Case, and the conclusion as\nbeing the Result of the argument. The argument is a piece of\ndeduction.  In this example the argument is also an argument from\npopulation to random sample that is also a necessary inference.\n\n\nBut now let us see what happens if we form a new argument by\ninterchanging the conclusion (the Result) with the major premise (the\nRule). The resultant argument becomes: All Ss are Ps\n(Result); all Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, all\nMs are Ps (Rule). This is the invalid syllogism\nAAA-3. But let us now construe it as pertaining to drawing conclusions\non the basis of taking samples. The argument then becomes: All balls\nin this particular random sample are red; all balls in this particular\nrandom sample are taken from this urn; therefore, all balls in this\nurn are red. What we have here is an argument from sample to\npopulation. This sort of argument is what Peirce understood to be the\ncore meaning of induction.  That is to say, for Peirce, induction in\nthe most basic sense is argument from random sample to population. It \nshould be clear that inductive inference is not necessary inference: it \nmight well turn out that the claims stated in the premises are true \neven though the claim made in the conclusion is false.\n\n\nLet us now go further and see what happens if, from the deduction\nAAA-1, we form a new argument by interchanging the conclusion (the\nResult) with the minor premise (the Case). The resultant argument\nbecomes: All Ms are Ps (Rule); all Ss are\nPs (Result); therefore, all Ss are Ms\n(Case). This is the invalid syllogism AAA-2. But let us now regard it\nas pertaining to drawing conclusions on the basis of taking\nsamples. The argument then becomes: All balls in this urn are red; all\nballs in this particular random sample are red; therefore, all balls\nin this particular random sample are taken from this urn. What we have\nhere is nothing at all like an argument from population to sample or\nan argument from sample to population: rather, it is a form of probable\nargument entirely different from both deduction and induction. It has\nthe air of conjecture or \u201ceducated \nguess\u201d about it. This new type of\nargument Peirce called hypothesis (also, retroduction, and also, \nabduction). It should be clear that abduction is never necessary \ninference\n\n\nThere is no need to consider the variant of AAA-1 that is obtained by\ninterchanging the Rule and the Case in AAA-1. The resultant argument\nis of the form AAA-4, which is exactly the same argument as AAA-1 with\ninterchanged premises. So it is simply deduction over again.\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s thinking about deduction, induction, and abduction can be seen \nalso from examples he gives of arguments that are similar to the syllogisms \nhe discusses, but retain the universal affirmative judgment only for the \nCase, using a definite percentage between 0% and 100% for both the Rule \nand the Result.\n\n\nCorresponding to AAA-1 (deduction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ms are Ps (Rule);\nall Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, X%\nof Ss are Ps (Result). Construing this argument, as\nwe did before, as applying to drawing balls from urns, the argument\nbecomes: X% of the balls in this urn are red; all the balls\nin this random sample are taken from this urn; therefore, X%\nof the balls in this random sample are red. Peirce still regards this\nargument as being a deduction, even though it is not\u2014as the\nargument AAA-1 is\u2014a necesary inference. He calls such an\nargument a \u201cstatistical deduction\u201d or a\n\u201cprobabilistic deduction proper.\u201d\n\n\n\nCorresponding to AAA-3 (induction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ss are Ps (Result);\nall Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, X%\nof Ms are Ps (Rule). Construing this argument as\napplying to drawing balls from urns, the argument becomes: X%\nof the balls in this random sample are red; all the balls in this\nrandom sample are taken from this urn; therefore, X% of the\nballs in this urn are red. Here we still have an argument whose\nessence is the logical transition from a random sample to the\npopulation from which the sample is taken. The inference is made by\nvirtue of what Hans Reichenbach called \u201cthe straight\nrule\u201d: the proportion of a trait found in the sample is\nattributed also to the population.\n\n\nCorresponding to AAA-2 (abduction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ms are Ps\n(Rule); X% of Ss are Ps (Result);\ntherefore, all Ss are Ms (Case). Construing this\nargument as applying to drawing balls from urns, the argument becomes:\nX% of the balls in this urn are red; X% of the balls\nin this random sample are red; therefore, all the balls in this random\nsample are taken from this urn. Again here we have the character of an\neducated guess or inference to a plausible explanation.\n\n\nOver many years Peirce modified his views on the three types of\narguments, sometimes changing his views but mostly extending them by\nexpanding his commentary upon the original trichotomy.  Occasionally\nhe swerved between one view and another concerning which larger class\nof arguments a particular instance or sub-type of argument belonged\nto. For example, he seemed to have some hesitation about whether\narguments from analogy should be construed as inductions (arguments\nfrom a sample of the properties of things to a population of the\nproperties of things) or abductions (conjectures made on the basis of\nsufficient similarity, which notion might not easily be analyzed in\nterms of sets of properties).\n\n\nThe most important extension Peirce made of his earliest views on\nwhat deduction, induction, and abduction involved was to integrate the\nthree argument forms into his view of the systematic procedure for\nseeking truth that he called the \u201cscientific method.\u201d As\nso integrated, deduction, induction, and abduction are not simply\nargument forms any more: they are three phases of the methodology of\nscience, as Peirce conceived this methodology. In fact, in Peirce\u2019s\nmost mature philosophy he virtually (perhaps totally and literally)\nequates the trichotomy with the three phases he discerns in the\nscientific method. Scientific method begins with abduction or\nhypothesis: because of some perhaps surprising or puzzling phenomenon,\na conjecture or hypothesis is made about what actually is going\non. This hypothesis should be such as to explain the surprising\nphenomenon, such as to render the phenomenon more or less a matter of\ncourse if the hypothesis should be true. Scientific method then\nproceeds to the stage of deduction: by means of necessary inferences,\nconclusions are drawn from the provisionally-adopted hypothesis about\nthe obtaining of phenomena other than the surprising one that\noriginally gave rise to the hypothesis. Conclusions are reached, that\nis to say, about other phenomena that must obtain if the hypothesis\nshould actually be true.  These other phenomena must be such that\nexperimental tests can be performed whose results tell us whether the\nfurther phenomena do obtain or do not obtain.  Finally, scientific\nmethod proceeds to the stage of induction: experiments are actually\ncarried out in order to test the provisionally-adopted hypothesis by\nascertaining whether the deduced results do or do not obtain. At this\npoint scientific method enters one or the other of two \u201cfeedback\nloops.\u201d If the deduced consequences do obtain, then we loop back\nto the deduction stage, deducing still further consequences of our\nhypothesis and experimentally testing for them again.  But, if the\ndeduced consequences do not obtain, then we loop back to the abduction\nstage and come up with some new hypothesis that explains both our\noriginal surprising phenomenon and any new phenomena we have uncovered\nin the course of testing our first, and now failed, hypothesis. Then\nwe pass on to the deduction stage, as before. The entire procedure of\nhypothesis-testing, and not merely that part of it that consists of\narguing from sample to population, is called induction in Peirce\u2019s\nlater philosophy.\n\n\nAn important part of Peirce\u2019s full conception of scientific method is\nwhat he called the \u201ceconomics (or: economy) of research.\u201d\nThe idea is that, because research is difficult, research labor-time\nis valuable and should not be wasted.  Both in the creation of\nhypotheses to be tested and in the experiments chosen to test these\nhypotheses, we should act so as to get the very most cognitive bang\nfor the buck, so to say. The object is to proceed at every stage so as\nto maximize the reduction in indeterminacy of our beliefs. Peirce had\nan elaborate, mathematical theory of some aspects of the economy of\nresearch, and he published several complex papers on this topic. The\nfollowing section of the present article contains further information\non Peirce\u2019s notion of the economy of research.\n",
