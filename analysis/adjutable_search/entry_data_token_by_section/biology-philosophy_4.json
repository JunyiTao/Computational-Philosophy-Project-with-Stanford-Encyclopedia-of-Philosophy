Philosophy of Molecular Biology\n\nWe mentioned above that the reduction of Mendelian genetics to\nmolecular genetics was one of the first topics to be discussed in the\nphilosophy of biology. The initial debate between Schaffner and Hull\nwas followed by the so-called \u201canti-reductionist\nconsensus\u201d (Kitcher 1984). The reductionist position was revived\nin a series of important papers by Kenneth Waters (1990, 1994) and\ndebate over the cognitive relationship between the two disciplines\ncontinues today. However, the question is not now framed as a simple\nchoice between reduction and irreducibility (Griffiths 1999; Kitcher\n1999; Sober 1999). Rather, a variety of concepts have been introduced\nand discussed including multiple realizability, realization, and\nmechanism (Wilson 2005, Craver 2007; Polger & Shapiro 2016). These\nhave been important in thinking about genetics but also neuroscience and\ncell biology more generally. For example, Lindley Darden, Schaffner\nand others have argued that explanations in molecular biology are not\nneatly confined to one ontological level, and hence that ideas of\n\u2018reduction\u2019 derived from classical examples like the\nreduction of the phenomenological gas laws to molecular kinematics in\nnineteenth century physics are simply inapplicable (Darden and Maull\n1977; Schaffner 1993). Moreover, molecular biology does not have the\nkind of grand theory based around a set of laws or a set of\nmathematical models that is familiar from the physical sciences.\nInstead, highly specific mechanisms that have been uncovered in detail\nin one model organism seem to act as \u201cexemplars\u201d allowing\nthe investigation of similar, although not necessarily identical,\nmechanisms in other organisms that employ the same, or related,\nmolecular interactants. Darden and others have argued that these\n\u201cmechanisms\u201d \u2013 specific collections of entities and\ntheir distinctive activities \u2013 are the fundamental unit of\nscientific discovery and scientific explanation, not only in molecular\nbiology, but in a wide range of special sciences (Machamer, Darden\net al. 2000; Craver & Darden 2013; see also Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993). There is an interesting question about whether the\nnotion of mechanism aptly applies in other areas of biology (Skipper\n& Millstein 2005; Havstad 2011). \n\nAnother important topic in the philosophy of molecular biology has\nbeen the concept of the gene (Beurton, Falk and Rheinberger 2000;\nWaters 2000, 2004; Griffiths and Stotz 2007). Philosophers have also\nwritten extensively on the concept of genetic information, the general\ntenor of the literature being that it is difficult to reconstruct this\nidea precisely in a way that does justice to the apparent weight\nplaced on it by molecular biologists (Sarkar 1996; Maynard Smith 2000;\nGodfrey-Smith 2001; Griffiths 2001; Jablonka 2002; Rosenberg 2006).\nFor example, does DNA actually carry semantic information (Shea\n2007)? If it does not, is this a useful fiction, or is it hindering\nmolecular biology (Levy 2001)? \n",
