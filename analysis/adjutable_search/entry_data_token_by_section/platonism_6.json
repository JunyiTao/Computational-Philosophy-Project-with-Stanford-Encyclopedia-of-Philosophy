    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Properties and Relations\n4.3 Properties and Relations\n\nOne way to argue for a platonistic view of properties and relations is\nfirst to use the argument of\n section 4.2\n to argue for a platonistic view of propositions, and then to claim\nthat this argument already contains an argument for properties and\nrelations, because properties and relations are components of\npropositions. If we adopt a Russellian view of propositions, this is\nstraightforward, because it is built into the Russellian view that\npropositions are composed of objects, properties, and relations (see\n section 1).\n If we adopt a Fregean view of propositions, however, the situation is\ndifferent. On the Fregean view, propositions are composed of senses,\nwhich we can think of as meanings, or concepts. Now, Frege himself did\nnot use the word \u2018concept\u2019 to talk about these things\n\u2014 he used the German \u2018sinn\u2019, which is usually\ntranslated as \u2018sense\u2019 \u2014 but we can use the word\n\u2018concept\u2019 here. On this way of talking, we can say that on\na Fregean view, if we have good reason to countenance the existence\nof, e.g., the proposition that roses are red, then we also have good\nreason to countenance the existence of the concept red. Now,\nsome Fregeans might want to say that the property of redness just\nis the concept of redness, and if so, then they could\nmaintain with Russellians that if there exist propositions, then there\nalso exist properties and relations. But most Fregeans would want to\ndeny that properties are concepts, so in order to motivate a\nplatonistic view of properties and relations, they would need an\nentirely different argument. And since we have already found that the\nOne Over Many argument for properties and relations is not cogent,\nthis other argument would presumably be a version of the singular term\nargument, one that was aimed specifically at establishing the\nexistence of properties and relations.\n\nThe most obvious way to formulate an independent property-and-relation\nversion of the singular term argument would be to appeal to sentences\nlike\n\n(P1) Mars possesses the property of redness\n\n\nand\n\n(R1) San Francisco stands in the north-of relation to Los Angeles.\n\n\nIn order to make out a version of the singular term argument here,\nplatonists would need to begin by arguing that these sentences commit\nus to the existence of the property of redness and the north-of\nrelation, respectively, because (a) they have singular terms that\ndenote those things, and (b) they are true. In order to motivate claim\n(a), platonists would have to refute the paraphrase-nominalist claim\nthat sentences like (P1) and (R1) are equivalent to sentences like\n\u2018Mars is red\u2019 and \u2018San Francisco is north of Los\nAngeles\u2019 and that none of these sentences entails the existence\nof properties or relations. And in order to motivate claim (b),\nplatonists would have to refute the fictionalist view that sentences\nlike (P1) and (R1) are untrue because they do entail the existence of\nproperties and relations and because there are no such things as\nproperties or relations (of course, fictionalists maintain that while\n(P1) and (R1) aren't literally true, they can still be used\ncolloquially to say things that about the world that are essentially\naccurate \u2014 see\n section 3).[10]\n\nIf platonists managed to establish the existence of properties and\nrelations in this way, they would still need to argue that such things\ncould only be abstract objects. That is, they would have to argue that\nproperties and relations are not ideas (as conceptualists claim) or\nuniversals inhering in physical things (as immanent realists\nclaim).\n\nThe arguments listed above against conceptualistic or psychologistic\nviews of numbers also tell against conceptualism about properties and\nrelations. For instance, as Russell (1912, chapter IX) points out,\nproperty claims and relational claims seem to be objective; e.g., the\nfact that Mount Everest is taller than Mont Blanc is a fact that holds\nindependently of us; but conceptualism about universals entails that\nif we all died, it would no longer be true that Mount Everest bears\nthe taller than relation to Mont Blanc, because that relation would no\nlonger exist. And, second, conceptualism seems simply to get the\nsemantics of our property discourse wrong, for it seems to confuse\nproperties with our ideas of them. The English sentence \u2018Red is\na color\u2019 does not seem to be about anybody's idea of redness; it\nseems to be about redness, the actual color, which, it seems, is\nsomething objective.\n\nThere are also some very famous arguments against the immanent realist\nview of properties and relations. First, it is not clear that it is\ncoherent to say that there is such a thing as redness and that this\none thing exists in many different objects at the same time.\nSecond, it is not clear what it is for an object to possess a property\non the immanent realist view. Most immanent realists would not say\nthat property possession is a full-blown relation, for this\nwould just be another universal, and it is commonly thought that if\nimmanent realists adopted this view, it would lead to an unacceptable\ninfinite regress. (If we're told that an object a possesses\nFness iff a stands in the possession relation to\nFness, then one might ask, \u201cWhat is it for an object\nand a property to stand in the possession relation to one\nanother?\u201d, and so on. For more on this, see the entry on\n properties.)\n In light of this, many immanent realists maintain that when an object\na possesses a property Fness, a and\nFness are \u201clinked together\u201d in some\nnon-relational way, e.g., a way that is more intimate, or primitive,\nthan ordinary relational connections. But it is not clear what this\nreally amounts to. (Immanent realists might respond that platonists\nalso have a problem here \u2014 i.e., that platonists also have to\nprovide an account of the relation, or \u201cconnection\u201d,\nbetween objects and properties. But some platonists might argue that\nthe problem isn't as bad for them because platonistic properties are\ncausally inert, and so they are not responsible in any way\nfor objects having the natures they have, and they do not play any\nimportant role in our explanations of why objects have the\nnatures they have. For instance, if a is F,\nFness is not responsible in any way for a having the\nnature that it has. Thus, platonists might claim that a is\nsimply an example of Fness and that there is no more\nto their relation than\n that.[11]\n Immanent realists, however, think that ordinary physical objects are\nthe way they are because they possess the properties they do.\nThus, they seem committed to the thesis that there is some sort of\nphysically substantial connection, or link, between objects and their\nproperties, and it is not at all clear what this could be. There has\nbeen a lot of philosophy dedicated to this problem, but there is no\nconsensus on how (or whether) it can be solved.)\n\nIt is worth noting that platonists who argue for properties and\nrelations in conjunction with propositions \u2014 i.e., by first\narguing for propositions and then claiming that properties and\nrelations are components of propositions \u2014 will have an easier\ntime arguing that properties and relations couldn't exist in our minds\n(as conceptualists say) or in things (as immanent realists say). In\nconnection with conceptualism, platonists of this sort could claim\nthat the argument given in\n section 4.2\n for thinking that \u2018that\u2019-clauses don't refer to mentalese\nsentence tokens suggests that propositions (which are the referents of\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses) could not be made up of properties that\nexist in our heads. And in connection with immanent realism,\nplatonists of this sort could argue that propositions couldn't be\ncomposed of immanent-realist properties, because people can believe\npropositions that are composed of properties that are not instantiated\nin the physical world. For instance, it seems that sentences like\n\u2018Johnny believes that there is a four-hundred-story building in\nSally's backyard\u2019 can be true, and so according to the above\nplatonist argument for propositions, there must be such a thing as the\nproposition that there is a four-hundred-story building in Sally's\nbackyard. But if propositions have properties as components, then this\nproposition has as a component the property of being a\nfour-hundred-story building. But if properties exist only in physical\nthings, as immanent realists suggest, then there is no such thing as\nthe property of being a four-hundred-story building, since presumably,\nnothing in the universe has this property. Thus, the conclusion here\nis that if propositions have properties as components, then the\nproperties in question have to be transcendent, platonist properties,\nnot immanent\n properties.[12]\n",
