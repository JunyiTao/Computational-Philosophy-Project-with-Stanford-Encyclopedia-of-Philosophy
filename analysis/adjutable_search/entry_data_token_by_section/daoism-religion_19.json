    "main_text": "Dao and Cosmos || Cosmogony\n4.3 Cosmogony\n\nTo explain the relation between Dao and cosmos, the Daode\njing describes a sequence of states taken on by the Dao,\nincluding the Dao itself, unity, duality (Yin and\nYang), and finally multiplicity: \u201cThe Dao generates the\nOne; the One generates the Two; the Two generate the Three; the Three\ngenerate the Ten Thousand Things\u201d (sec. 42). This basic sequence\nis always respected even though other texts or authors may mention\nadditional intermediate stages or exclude them (as does the\nZhuangzi: \u201cThe ten thousand things come forth from\nNon-Being\u201d; ch. 23; Watson 1968: 257). The vertical arrangement\nof the stages illustrates the process of descent from\nthe Dao to the cosmos, but also implies\u2014and often explicitly\noutlines\u2014a corresponding process of ascent from\nthe cosmos to the Dao, to be performed gradually and with the support of suitable\npractices.\n\nWhen this hierarchical arrangement is represented as a sequence of\nmetaphoric time stages, the discourse shifts from ontology to cosmogony. In\naddition to the one mentioned above, Daoism has elaborated several\nother accounts of cosmogony during its history (Robinet 1997a). Many\nof them focus on hundun, a term usually rendered as\n\u201cchaos\u201d or \u201cthe inchoate\u201d, in the sense of\nsomething that has just begun to be and therefore is not yet fully\nformed or developed, but from which the cosmos finally emerges (cf.\nDaode jing 25: \u201cThere is something inchoate and yet\naccomplished, born before Heaven and Earth\u201d). In a famous\npassage of the Zhuangzi, this state is represented by an\nemperor called Hundun who ruled \u201con the Center\u201d. As his\nbody had no openings, the Emperors of the North and of the South\ndecided to make him look similar to a human, providing him with eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. \u201cEach day they\nbored one opening, and on the seventh day Hundun died\u201d (ch. 7;\nWatson 1968: 97). As shown by Norman Girardot (1983: 113\u201333),\nthis story attributes the cause of Hundun\u2019s death and the shift\nfrom chaos to cosmos not only to the emergence of duality\u2014the\nEmperors of the North and the South\u2014but also to the creation of\nsocial institutions. What brings the harmony of the \u201cchaotic\norder\u201d to an end is the emergence of the \u201csocial\norder\u201d.\n\nAmong later accounts (Kohn 1998: 179\u201397; Robinet 2002), Laojun\n(Lord Lao) began to be seen as the \u201cbody\u201d of the Dao, from\nwhich the cosmos is generated (Seidel 1969: 84\u201391). The Way of\nthe Celestial Masters (Bokenkamp 1997: 188\u201392; Seidel 1969:\n79\u201384) and Lingbao Daoism (Lagerwey 1981: 104; Bokenkamp 1997:\n380\u201381; Robinet 2002: 148\u201355) also created their own\ncosmogonies.\n",
