However, the fact that it is\ncommonly thought to undermine the validity of consent has led to its\nfrequent mention in areas where the validity of consent is at\nissue.\n\nOne such area is medical ethics, where proposed conditions for\nautonomous informed consent often reference the need to ensure that\nconsent is not manipulated. In fact, one of the earliest sustained\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation appears in Ruth Faden, Tom\nBeauchamp, and Nancy King\u2019s influential book, A History and\nTheory of Informed Consent (1986). The view that manipulation\nundermines the validity of consent is widely held among medical\nethicists. However, there is far less agreement about how to determine\nwhether a given form of influence is manipulative. Nowhere is this\nlack of agreement more apparent than in recent discussions of\n\u201cnudges\u201d.\n\nThe concept of a nudge was introduced by Cass Sunstein and Richard\nThaler to refer to the deliberate introduction of subtle, non-coercive\ninfluences into people\u2019s decision-making to get them to make\nmore optimal choices (Thaler & Sunstein 2009; Sunstein 2014). Some\nnudges merely provide better and more comprehensible information;\nthese nudges might seem best characterized as influences that improve\nthe quality of rational deliberation. However, even with\n\u201cpurely\u201d informational nudges, one might worry that the\nselection of which information is presented could be\nmanipulative; perhaps providing nutrition information on food\npackaging nudges people to make food choices based on health\nconsiderations rather than taste, for instance. More pressing concerns\narise with nudges that operate by psychological mechanisms whose\nrelationship to rational deliberation is questionable at\nbest. Many of these nudges exploit heuristics, reasoning and\ndecision-making biases, and other psychological processes that operate\noutside of conscious awareness. For example, some evidence suggests\nthat patients are more likely to choose an operation if they are told\nthat it has a 90% survival rate rather than a 10% fatality rate. Would\nit be manipulative for a surgeon to exploit this framing effect to\nnudge the patient into making the decision that the surgeon thinks\nbest? Is it manipulative for a cafeteria manager to place healthier\nfood items at eye level to nudge customers into choosing them? The\nquestion of whether and when nudges manipulate has sparked a lively\ndebate.\n\nSome defenders of nudges suggest that because it is often impossible\nto frame a decision without pointing the decision-maker in\nsome direction, there is nothing manipulative about framing\nsuch decisions in one way rather than another. For example, physicians\nmust provide outcome information either in terms of fatality rate or\nsurvival rate (and if they give both, they must give one first), and\ncafeteria managers must choose something to put at eye level in the\ndisplays. This being the case, why think that deliberately choosing\none way of framing the decision over another is manipulative? Some\ndefenders of nudges suggest that in cases where it is inevitable to\nintroduce a non-rational influence into decision-making, deliberately\ndoing so is not manipulative. But there are reasons to be wary of this\nline of thought. Suppose that Jones is traveling to a job interview on\na subway car so crowded that it is inevitable that he will bump up\nagainst his fellow passengers. Suppose that he capitalizes on this\nfact to deliberately bump his rival job candidate (who is on the same\nsubway car) out the door just as it closes, thus ensuring that he will\nbe late for his interview. Clearly the fact that it was inevitable\nthat Jones\u2019s rival would be subjected to some bumping\ndoes not excuse Jones for intentionally bumping his rival out the\ndoor. Similarly, even if we inevitably introduce non-rational\ninfluences into each other\u2019s decision-making, that fact seems\ninsufficient to prove that such influences can never be manipulative.\nNo doubt this analogy is imperfect, but it should suffice to call into\nquestion the assumption that a deliberate nudge is not manipulative\nsimply because some nudging is inevitable. (For a similar argument,\nsee Douglass 2022.)\n\nMore nuanced discussions of whether nudges manipulate tend to focus\nless on the inevitability of nudging in some direction or another, and\nmore on the mechanisms by which the nudging occurs, and the direction\nin which it pushes the person being nudged. Although there is wide\nagreement that some nudges can be manipulative, so far no consensus\nhas emerged about which nudges are manipulative or how to distinguish\nmanipulative from non-manipulative nudges. (For a sample of approaches\nto the question of whether and when nudges manipulate, see\nBlumenthal-Barby 2012; Blumenthal-Barby & Burroughs 2012; Saghai\n2013; Wilkinson 2013; Hanna 2015; Moles 2015; and Nys & Engelen\n2017. For arguments that nudges can be sometimes morally justified\neven when they are manipulative, see Wilkinson 2017 and Nys &\nEngelen 2017).\n\nQuestions about the legitimacy of nudges go beyond the medical\ncontext. Thaler and Sunstein advocate their use by government,\nemployers, and other institutions besides the health care industry.\nThe use of nudges by government raises additional concerns, especially\nabout the paternalism behind them (Arneson 2015; White 2013).\nQuestions about other forms of manipulation in the political sphere\nhave also been raised by philosophers and political theorists. The\nidea that political leaders might gain, retain, or consolidate\npolitical power by means that we would now call manipulative can be\ntraced back at least as far back as ancient Greek figures like\nCallicles and Thrasymachus. Niccolo Machiavelli not only details but\nrecommends political tactics that we would likely regard as\nmanipulative. More recent philosophical work on political manipulation\nincludes Robert Goodin\u2019s 1980 book on Manipulatory\nPolitics and Claudia Mills\u2019s important paper,\n\u201cPolitics and Manipulation\u201d (1995), as well as Dowding\n(2016), Riker (1986), Ware (1981), Gorton (2016), Whitfield (2020),\nand the papers collected in (Le Cheminant and Parrish 2011); for an\noverview of this literature, see Noggle (2021).\n\nIn the field of business ethics, much philosophical attention has been\nfocused on the question of whether advertising is manipulative. The\neconomist John Kenneth Galbraith famously called advertising\n\u201cthe manipulation of consumer desire\u201d and compared being\nthe target of advertising with being\n\n\nassailed by demons which instilled in him a passion sometimes for silk\nshirts, sometimes for kitchenware, sometimes for chamber pots, and\nsometimes for orange squash. (Galbraith 1958)\n\n\nSeveral philosophers have made similar criticisms of advertising.\nOften, these criticisms are limited to forms of advertising that do\nnot simply convey accurate factual information. As is the case with\npurely informational nudges, the presentation of accurate information\nin advertising might not be manipulative in and of itself, though\nperhaps the selection of which information is presented might be\nmanipulative. Be that as it may, most advertising attempts to\ninfluence consumer behavior by means other than or in addition to\npurely providing accurate information. Such non-informational\nadvertising is the most apt target for worries about manipulation. Tom\nBeauchamp and Roger Crisp have made influential arguments that such\nadvertising can be manipulative (Beauchamp 1984; Crisp 1987). Similar\ncriticisms claim that non-informational advertising can subvert\nautonomy or improperly tamper with consumers\u2019 desires (e.g.,\nSantilli 1983). Such critiques are either versions of or close\nrelatives to critiques of advertising as manipulation. On the other\nside, Robert Arrington argues that, as a matter of fact, advertising\nvery seldom manipulates its audience or undermines its\naudience\u2019s autonomy (Arrington 1982). Michael Phillips has\nmarshalled a large body of empirical evidence to argue that while some\nadvertising is manipulative, its critics vastly overestimate its power\nto influence consumers (Phillips 1997).\n",
