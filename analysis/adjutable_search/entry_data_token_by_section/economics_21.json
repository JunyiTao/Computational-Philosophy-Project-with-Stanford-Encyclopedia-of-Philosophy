    "main_text": "Rational choice theory || Individual rationality\n5.1 Individual rationality\n\nThe barebones theory of rationality discussed above in\n Section 1.1\n takes an agent\u2019s\n preferences\n (rankings of states of affairs) to be rational if they are complete\nand transitive, and it takes the agent\u2019s choice to be rational\nif the agent does not prefer any feasible alternative to the one he or\nshe chooses. Such a theory of rationality is clearly too weak, because\nit says nothing about belief or what rationality implies when agents\ndo not know (with certainty) everything relevant to their choices. But\nit may also be too strong, since, as Isaac Levi in particular has\nargued (1986), there is nothing irrational about having incomplete\npreferences in situations involving uncertainty. Sometimes it is\nrational to suspend judgment and to refuse to rank alternatives that\nare not well understood. On the other hand, transitivity is a\nplausible condition, and the so-called \u201cmoney pump\u201d\nargument demonstrates that if one\u2019s preferences are intransitive\nand one is willing to make exchanges, then one can be exploited.\n(Suppose an agent A prefers X to Y,\nY to Z and Z to X, and that\nA will pay some small amount of money $P to exchange\nY for X, Z for Y, and X\nfor Z. That means that, starting with Z, A\nwill pay $P for Y, then $P again for\nX, then $P again for Z and so on. Agents\nare not this stupid. They will instead refuse to trade or adjust their\npreferences to eliminate the intransitivity (but see Schick 1986).\n\nOn the other hand, there is considerable experimental evidence that\npeople\u2019s preferences are not in fact transitive. Such evidence\ndoes not establish that transitivity is not a requirement of\nrationality. It may show instead that people are sometimes irrational.\nIn the case of so-called \u201cpreference reversals,\u201d for\nexample, it seems plausible that people in fact make irrational\nchoices (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971, Tversky and Thaler 1990).\nEvidence of persistent violations of transitivity is disquieting,\nsince standards of rationality should not be impossibly high.\n\nA further difficulty with the barebones theory of rationality concerns\nthe individuation of the objects of preference or choice. Consider,\nfor example, data from multistage ultimatum games. Suppose A\ncan propose any division of $10 between A and B.\nB can accept or reject A\u2019s proposal. If\nB rejects the proposal, then the amount of money drops to $5,\nand B gets to offer a division of the $5 which A can\naccept or reject. If A rejects B\u2019s offer, then\nboth players get nothing. Suppose that A proposes to divide\nthe money with $7 for A and $3 for B. B\ndeclines and offers to split the $5 evenly, with $2.50 for each.\nBehavior such as this is, in fact, common (Ochs and Roth 1989, p.\n362). Assuming that B prefers more money to less, these\nchoices appear to be a violation of transitivity. B prefers\n$3 to $2.50, yet declines $3 for certain for $2.50 (with some slight\nchance of A declining and B getting nothing). But\nthe objects of choice are not just quantities of money. B is\nturning down $3 as part of \u201ca raw deal\u201d in favor of $2.50\nas part of a fair arrangement. If the objects of choice are defined in\nthis way, there is no failure of transitivity.\n\nThis plausible observation gives rise to a serious problem. Unless\nthere are constraints on how the objects of choice are individuated,\nconditions of rationality such as transitivity are empty.\nA\u2019s choice of X over Y, Y\nover Z and Z over X does not violate\ntransitivity if \u201cX when the alternative is\nY\u201d is not the same object of choice as\n\u201cX when the alternative is Z\u201d. John\nBroome (1991) argues that further substantive principles of\nrationality are required to limit how alternatives are individuated or\nto require that agents be indifferent between alternatives such as\n\u201cX when the alternative is Y\u201d and\n\u201cX when the alternative is Z.\u201d\n\nTo extend the theory of rationality to circumstances involving\n risk\n (where the objects of choice are lotteries with known probabilities)\nand uncertainty (where agents do not know the probabilities or even\nall the possible outcomes of their choices) requires further\nprinciples of rationality, as well as controversial technical\nsimplifications. Subjective Bayesians suppose that individuals in\ncircumstances of uncertainty have well-defined subjective\nprobabilities (degrees of belief) over all the payoffs and thus that\nthe objects of choice can be modeled as lotteries, just as in\ncircumstances involving risk, though with subjective probabilities in\nplace of objective probabilities. See the entries on\n Bayes\u2019 theorem\n and\n Bayesian epistemology.\n The most important of the axioms needed for the theory of rational\nchoice under conditions of risk and uncertainty is the independence\ncondition. It says roughly that the preferences of rational agent\nbetween two lotteries that differ in only one outcome should match\ntheir preferences between the differing outcomes. Although initially\nplausible, the independence condition is very controversial. See\nAllais and Hagen (1979) and McClennen (1983, 1990).\n\nA considerable part of rational choice theory is concerned with\nformalizations of conditions of rationality and investigation of their\nimplications. When an agent\u2019s preferences are complete and\ntransitive and satisfy a further continuity condition, then they can\nbe represented by a so-called ordinal utility function. What this\nmeans is that it is possible to define a function that represents an\nagent\u2019s preferences so that U(X) >\nU(Y) if and only if the agent prefers X to\nY, and U(X) = U(Y) if and\nonly if the agent is indifferent between X and Y.\nThis function merely represents the preference ranking. It contains no\ninformation beyond the ranking. Any order-preserving transformation of\n\u201cU\u201d would represent the agent\u2019s preferences\njust as well.\n\nWhen an agent\u2019s preferences in addition satisfy the independence\ncondition and some other technical conditions, then they can be\nrepresented by an expected utility function (Harsanyi 1977b, ch. 4,\nHernstein and Milnor 1953, Ramsey 1926, and Savage 1972). Such a\nfunction has two important properties. First, the expected utility of\na lottery is equal to the sum of the (expected) utilities of its\nprizes weighted by their probabilities. Second, expected utility\nfunctions are unique up to a positive affine transformation. What this\nmeans is that if U and V are both expected utility\nfunctions representing the preferences of an agent, then for all\nobjects of preference, X, V(X) must be\nequal to aU(X) + b, where\na and b are real numbers and a is positive.\nIn addition, the axioms of rationality imply that the agent\u2019s\ndegrees of belief will satisfy the axioms of the probability\ncalculus.\n\nA great deal of controversy surrounds the theory of rationality, and\nthere have been many formal investigations into weakened or amended\ntheories of rationality. For further discussion, see Allais and Hagen\n1979, Barber\u00e0, Hammond and Seidl 1999, Kahneman and Tversky\n1979, Loomes and Sugden 1982, Luce and Raiffa 1957, Machina\n1987, and Gilboa and Schmeidler 2001.\n",
