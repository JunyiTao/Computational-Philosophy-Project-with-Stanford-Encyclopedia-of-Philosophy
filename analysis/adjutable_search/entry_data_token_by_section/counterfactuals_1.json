    "main_text": "Counterfactuals and Philosophy || What are Counterfactuals?\n1.1 What are Counterfactuals?\n\nIn philosophy and related fields, counterfactuals are taken to be\nsentences like: \n\n(1)If\ncolonial powers hadn\u2019t invaded, the Americas\nwould be very different.\n\n\nThis entry will follow this widely used terminology to avoid\nconfusion. However, this usage also promotes a confusion worth\ndispelling. Counterfactuals are not really conditionals with\ncontrary-to-fact antecedents. For example\n (2)\n can be used as part of an argument that the antecedent is true (Anderson\n1951):\n\n(2)If\nthere had been intensive agriculture in the\nPre-Columbian Americas, the natural environment would have been\nimpacted in specific ways. That is exactly what we find in many\nwatersheds.\n\n\nOn these grounds, it might be better to speak instead of\nsubjunctive conditionals, and reserve the term\ncounterfactual for subjunctive conditionals whose antecedent\nis assumed to be false in the\n discourse.[1]\n While slightly more enlightened, this use of the term does not match\nthe use of counterfactuals in the sprawling philosophical and\ninterdisciplinary literature surveyed here, and has its own drawbacks\nthat will be discussed shortly. This entry will use counterfactual\nconditional and subjunctive conditional interchangeably,\nhoping to now have dispelled the suggestion that all counterfactuals,\nin that sense, have contrary-to-fact antecedents.\n\nThe terminology of indicative and subjunctive conditionals is also\nvexed, but it aims to get at a basic contrast which begins between two\ndifferent forms of conditionals that can differ in truth value.\n (3)\n and\n (4)\n can differ in truth-value while holding fixed the world they are\nbeing evaluated\n in.[2]\n\n(3)If\nOswald didn\u2019t kill Kennedy, someone else did.\n(Indicative)\n(4)If\nOswald hadn\u2019t killed Kennedy, someone else\nwould\u2019ve. (Subjunctive)\n\n\nIt is easy to imagine a world where\n (3)\n is true, and\n (4)\n false. Consider a world like ours where Kennedy was assassinated.\nFurther suppose Oswald didn\u2019t do it, but some lone fanatic did\nfor deeply idiosyncratic reasons. Then\n (3)\n is true and\n (4)\n false. Another aspect of the contrast between indicative and\nsubjunctive conditionals is illustrated in\n (5)\n and\n (6).\n \n\n(5)# Bob never danced. If Bob danced,\nLeland danced.\n(6)Bob never danced. If Bob had danced,\nLeland would have danced.\n(7)Bob never danced. If Bob were to\ndance, Leland would dance.\n\n\nIndicatives like\n (5)\n are infelicitous when their antecedent has been denied, unlike the\nsubjunctives like\n (6)\n and\n (7)\n (Stalnaker 1975; Veltman 1986).\n\nThe indicative and subjunctive conditionals above differ from each\nother only in particular details of their linguistic form. It is\ntherefore plausible to explain their contrasting semantic behavior in\nterms of the semantics of those linguistic differences. Indicatives,\nlike\n (3)\n and\n (5),\n feature verbs in the simple past tense form, and no modal auxiliary\nin the consequent. Subjunctives, like\n (4)\n and\n (6),\n feature verbs in the past perfect (or \u201cpluperfect\u201d) with\na modal would in the consequent. Something in the\nneighborhood of these linguistic and semantic differences constitutes\nthe distinction between indicative and subjunctive\nconditionals\u2014summarized in\n Figure 1.[3]\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nAntecedents\nConsequents\nDeny Ante\u00adce\u00addent? \n\nIndicative\n(3),\n (5)\n V-ed, \u2026\nV-ed, \u2026\nNot felicitous \n\nSubjunctive\n\n(4),\n (6) \n had V-ed, were to V,\nV-ed, \u2026\n would have V, would V,\nwould have V-ed, \u2026\n Can be felicitous \n\n\nFigure 1: Rough Guide to Indicative and\nSubjunctive Conditionals\n\n\nAs with most neighborhoods, there are heated debates about the exact\nboundaries and the names\u2014especially when future-oriented\nconditionals are included. These debates are surveyed in the\nsupplement\n Indicative and Subjunctive Conditionals.\n The main entry will rely only on the agreed-upon paradigm examples\nlike\n (3)\n and\n (4).\n The labels indicative and subjunctive are also\nflawed since these two kinds of conditionals are not really\ndistinguished on the basis of whether they have indicative or\nsubjunctive mood in the antecedent or\n consequent.[4]\n But the terminology is sufficiently entrenched to permit this\ndistortion of linguistic reality.\n\nMuch recent work has been devoted to explaining how the semantic\ndifferences between indicative and subjunctive conditionals can be\nderived from their linguistic differences\u2014rather than treating\nthem as semantically unrelated. Much of this work has been done in\nlight of Kratzer\u2019s (1986, 2012)\ngeneral approach to modality according to which all conditionals are\ntreated as two-place modal operators. This approach is also discussed\nin the supplement\n Indicative and Subjunctive Conditionals.[5]\n This entry will focus on the basic logic and truth-conditions of\nsubjunctive conditionals as a whole, and will use the following\nnotation for them (following Stalnaker\n 1968).[6]\n\nSubjunctive Conditionals (Notation)\u00a0\n\n\\(\\phi>\\psi\\) symbolizes if it had been the case that \\(\\phi\\)\nthen it would have been the case that \\(\\psi\\) \n\n\nThis project and notation has an important limitation that should be\nhighlighted: it combines the meaning of the modal would and\nif\u2026then\u2026 into a single connective\n\u201c\\(>\\)\u201d. This makes it difficult to adequately\nrepresent subjunctive conditionals like: \n\n(8)\n\na.If Maya had run, she might have\nbeen elected.\nb.If Maya had run, she\nmight have been elected and would have been an excellent Senator.\nc.\u201cMr. Taft never asked my advice in the matter,\nbut if he had asked it, I should have emphatically advised him against\nthus stating publicly his religious belief.\u201d (Theodore\nRoosevelt)\nd.If\nMaya had run, she probably would have won and she might have won big.\n\n\n\n\n\nConditionals like\n (8a)\n have figured in debates about the semantics of counterfactuals and\nhave been modeled either as a related connective (D.\nLewis 1973b: \u00a71.5) or a normal\nwould-subjunctive conditional embedded under might\n(Stalnaker 1980, 1984: Ch.7). But the\nmore complex examples\n (8b)\u2013(8d)\n highlight the need for a more refined compositional analysis, like\nthose surveyed in\n Indicative and Subjunctive Conditionals.\n So, while this notation will be used in\n \u00a71.4\n and throughout\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a73,\n it should be regarded as an analytic convenience rather than a\ndefensible assumption.\n",
