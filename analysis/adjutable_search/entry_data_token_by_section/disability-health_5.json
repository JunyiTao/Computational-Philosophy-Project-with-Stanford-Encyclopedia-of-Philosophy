We discuss four contexts in which\nthese assumptions have been relied upon in policies and personal\ndecisions about creating or sustaining lives: reproductive testing for\ndisability, neonatal care, \u201cend-of-life\u201c decision making,\nand the use of \u201dquality-adjustment\u201d measures to assess the\ncost-effectiveness of health-care and other interventions.\n\nIn all of these cases, objections have been raised besides those\nconcerning the assumption that lives with serious disabilities must be\nsubstantially worse than lives without them. For example, in the case\nof life-termination, the debate also concerns the decisional capacity\nof newly disabled individuals; in the case of quality-adjustment, the\ndebate also concerns the assumption that the quality of a life should\naffect its priority in allocating scarce resources. We will, however,\nfocus on the objections that concern well-being.\n1.5.1 Reproductive testing\n\nSome prospective parents see life with some disabilities as worse than\nno life at all. This claim is often made with respect to such\nconditions as Tay-Sachs, Lesch-Nyan, and trisomies 13 and 18. Even for\nthose conditions, however, that view is not universally held\n(Wilkinson 2011). The notion of a life so bad that it is a harm to the\nindividual living it came to popular and philosophical attention in\nthe 1980s, when a number of lawsuits in the U.S claimed that\nphysicians or parents had wronged the child by failing to diagnose its\ncondition in utero and/or prevent its birth. These lawsuits appeared\nto require a comparison of existence and non-existence, which most\ncourts and some philosophers rejected. A majority of philosophers,\nhowever, starting with Joel Feinberg (1986), have concluded that the\nnotion can be useful in theory if not necessarily in practice.\n\nIn cases involving less severe disabilities, some prospective parents\nthink that they are protecting the welfare of \u201ctheir\nchild\u201d by preventing the existence of a child who would have a\ndisability. This attitude involves seeing the future child not as a\nparticular individual who can only exist with a disability, but as a\nrole that prospective parents do not want to fill with a disabled\nchild. Philosophers have debated the appropriateness of regarding\nfuture children in this way (Malek 2008; Hare 2007; Velleman 2008;\nWasserman 2008; Heyd 2009). Even if this view were appropriate, its\nmoral force would depend on the extent to which the diagnosed\ncondition could reasonably be expected to reduce the child\u2019s\nwelfare, as well as the existence and strength of a moral reason not\nto bring into existence persons with such welfare deficits.\n\nIn the context of prenatal testing, as with assessments of adult\nfunctioning, the extent to which a disabling condition reduces\nwell-being depends on the conception of well-being that is adopted.\nWith prenatal testing, however, there is an additional complication:\nthere is massive uncertainty about how the detected variants will be\nexpressed in the developing child. That depends on their their\ninterplay with other genes and interaction with a variety of\nenvironments. The formidable challenges of predicting phenotype may be\nmore readily acknowledged by health professionals than the even more\ndaunting challenges in the non-medical assessment of how life with a\ngiven phenotype could go for the person living it.\n1.5.2 Withdrawal of Life Support from Disabled Newborns\n\nThe debate over the withdrawal of life support for very premature and\nseverely disabled newborns surfaced in the 1980s with the 1982\nBloomington, Indiana Baby Doe case and the adoption of\nfederal guidelines for support of newborns and termination of\nlife-sustaining treatment. The debate continues as medical technology\npermits an increasing number of severely disabled newborns to survive.\nSome of the debate appears fairly abstract, concerning whether there\nshould be a \u201cgrey area\u201d around \u201ca life (just barely)\nworth living\u201d, in which parents and physicians would be\npermitted to decide for themselves whether to continue or withdraw\nlife-support (Wilkinson 2011). Disability scholars, however, have the\nmore practical concern that decisions about life-support, whether made\nby parents or caretakers, too often rely on inaccurate or misleading\nmedical indicators of expected well-being, resulting in significant\ndiscrimination against newborns with disabilities (Silvers and Francis\n2011). Although the\naccuracy of medical prediction may improve after birth, it remains\ndifficult to assess the potential of a neonate to develop higher\ncognitive functions. And although the prediction of the course of\nphysical impairments has improved, that improvement offers only a\npartial safeguard against the tendency of many parents and health\nprofessionals to exaggerate the hardships of life with an\nimpairment\u2014a tendency driven as much by stigma as by medical\nerror and uncertainty.\n1.5.3 \u201cEnd-of-Life\u201d Decision Making\n\nAssumptions about disability and well-being play an important if\nsomewhat less salient role in this context. They figure most\nprominently when the individual is no longer capable of deciding for\nherself whether to receive, continue or refuse life-sustaining\ntreatment. For adults once capable of making such decisions, two\nstandards apply to surrogate decision making: substituted\njudgment and best interest. The first involves judging\nwhat the individual would have wanted or chosen if she could want or\nchoose for her current situation; the second involves judging the\nperson\u2019s interests by a standard other than her own. In cases\nwhere the adult never had decisional capacity and there is no basis\nfor making a judgment about what the patient would have chosen, the\nbest interest standard applies. But those who judge the best interests\nof such an adult are prone to the same errors of projection as\nnondisabled people judging the well-being of disabled people. A\nnondisabled surrogate might be devastated at losing capacities the\ncognitively impaired individual never had, or assume that the\ninability to understand the source of, or reason for, physical pain\nmust be even more traumatic for that individual than it would be for\nthe surrogate. Such judgments are not clearly wrong, but rather\nspeculative; the primary error is in overconfidence.\n\nAssumptions about disability and well-being also play a significant\nrole in judging the reasonableness of requests by competent adults to\nend, or not receive, life sustaining treatment. Many jurisdictions\nrecognize the right of such individuals to make this decision for\nthemselves, but disability advocates remain concerned that their\ndecisions are more likely to be considered reasonable, and respected,\nif they are made in response to severe, permanent disabilities. Thus,\nin the influential case of Elizabeth Bouvia, the court allowed a fully\ncompetent, severely disabled, women to refuse the medical support that\ncould have prolonged her life indefinitely. Critics of the decision\nmaintained that both Bouvia and the court were unduly swayed by the\nperceived indignity of her physical dependence, and by their\ndifficulty in seeing how life could go very well with a severe\ndisability (Asch 2005; Gill 1992; Longmore 1987).\n1.5.4 Health Related Quality-of-Life Measures\n\nPerhaps the setting in which the relationship of disability to\nwell-being has received most attention is the assessment of\n\u201cquality of life\u201d (see, generally, Wasserman, et al.\n2005a). For judging the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions,\nit is useful to have measures of well-being that facilitate\nquantitative comparison. Quality-of-life measures in medicine and\nhealth care offer benchmarks for assessing the well-being of groups of\npeople, focusing on the aspects of well-being most amenable to\nreliable assessment. There is no guarantee that individuals who are\ndoing well by such measures are actually living good lives according\nto more robust philosophical criteria of well-being. Any uniform\nmetric for quality of life will provide an oversimplified assessment\nof an individual\u2019s well-being, and to some extent this is\nunavoidable from a policy perspective. But the worry when these\njudgments are applied to people with disabilities is not\noversimplification so much as systematic bias.\n\nAssumptions about the adverse effect of disability on well-being\npervade the measurement of \u201chealth-related quality of\nlife\u201d (HRQL). In particular, two features of many standard\napproaches to measuring HRQL treat disability as inimical to\nwell-being: 1) assuming that an individual\u2019s adaptation to a\ndisability is a source of distortion or a measurement artifact in\nassessing how well he or she is doing; 2) expanding the definition of\nhealth outcomes to include not only the physiological and\nsensory-motor effects of disease and injury, but their\n\u201csequelae\u201d\u2014their effect on daily living and social\nparticipation. The first feature ignores the extent to which\nadaptation involves changes that would count as improvements in\nwell-being on most objective as well as subjective accounts (Menzel\net al. 2002; Barnes 2009a). The second fails to distinguish the\ncontribution of medical and social/environmental factors to the\nrestriction or loss of objectively valuable activities (Wasserman, et\nal. 2005a). These features not only exaggerate the adverse impact of\ndisabilities, but in some contexts, threaten adverse consequences for\npeople with disabilities.\n\nThe inclusion of functional and activity limitations as health\noutcomes is in tension with the social model of disability, which\ntreats many of those limitations as due to an exclusionary\nenvironment. It also conflicts with the view, discussed below, that an\nindividual can be disabled but healthy. The assumption that adaptation\nto disability cannot be an accurate measure of well-being has\nmotivated a reliance on health professionals to assess the quality of\nlife with specific disabilities, rather than on people with those\ndisabilities (Murray 1996). The refusal to treat people with\ndisabilities as reliable witnesses to, or authorities on, their\nwell-being is particularly striking, given that nondisabled people\nalso adapt to the vicissitudes of their lives (Brickman and Campbell\n1971). As Wasserman, et al. note:\n\n\nThe lives of people with disabilities are assumed to be of low\nquality, whatever environmental factors mediate the impact of their\nimpairments, and their own testimony to the contrary is seen as\ninherently unreliable. Their adaptations to their impairments appear\nnot as instances of the universal processes of adjustment to changed\ncircumstances, but as disability-specific strategies for recovering\nthe ground that has been lost, or for covering up its loss through\nbenign self-deception (2005a: 11).\n\n\nThis view of disability is not merely inaccurate. Its use to assess\nthe effectiveness of health care interventions has disturbing\nimplications for the lives of people with disabilities. Effectiveness\nmeasures typically treat a disability as equivalent for assessment\npurposes to a shorter life-span. Health outcomes are measured by\nlife-years saved or gained; life-years are \u201cadjusted\u201d by\ntheir quality, and their rated quality is substantially reduced if the\nintervention fails to correct, risks causing, or causes a disability.\nAs a result, people who have, or will be left with, disabilities also\nhave their future life-years adjusted downward in light of the\npresumed lower quality of those life-years. As a result, the priority\nof persons with disabilities for life-saving interventions is\nsubstantially reduced. Because it employed such discounting, the 1990\nOregon Health Care Plan to set priorities for Medicaid-funded\nprocedures was found to discriminate against people with disabilities\n(Bodenheimer 1997). Several years later, the most comprehensive\ninternational effort to develop summary measures of population health\nproposed a more explicit and very sharp discounting of lives with\ndisabilities in assessing the \u201cGlobal Burden of Disease\u201d\nand in setting priorities for its reduction (Murray 1996). Although\nsome objectionable features of the discounting methodology have been\nmodified (Saloman and Murray 2002), the Global Burden of Disease\nframeworks continue to adopt procedures that result in strikingly low\nquality-of-life estimates for many disabilities.\n\nMany mainstream philosophers and bioethicists question the use of\nsummary health measures in priority setting (Harris 1987; Brock 1995).\nThey argue that their proposed use is based either on a questionable\nutilitarian assessment of lives as more valuable if they\n\u201ccontain\u201d more utility, or on the controversial\ndistributive principle that society should give scarce goods to those\nwho will benefit most from them. But many still defend the general\nassumptions about disability and quality of life that informed those\nmeasures (Brock 2005). Other philosophers and disability scholars have\nchallenged these assumptions (Bickenbach 2005). Some have gone even\nfurther, questioning whether quality-of-life assessments place an\nexaggerated premium on the prevention or correction of impairments\nthat do not, in hospitable environments, preclude rich and rewarding\nlives (Barnes 2009a; Asch and Wasserman 2010).\n2. Disability and Health\n\nPeople appear to regard health as one of the most important goods,\nmore important than wealth, status, or professional success. Health is\nseen as special in part for instrumental reasons, because it is\nthought to be a prerequisite for many or most other goods. So the\nrelationship of health to disability is an issue of central concern\nfor those who seek to replace or supplement a medical model of\ndisability (Bickenbach 1993; Shakespeare 2006).\n\nThe social model of disability, which informs the Americans with\nDisabilities Act and kindred legislation, may appear to move\ndisability away from health policy and toward civil rights. Yet\nmovement in one direction does not preclude movement in the other.\nPeople with disabilities have significant health care needs, and their\nneeds may depend to some extent upon their disabilities. For\nphilosophers as well as policy makers, the challenge posed by the\nsocial model is to acknowledge the importance of health and health\ncare for people with disabilities without assuming that all people\nwith disabilities are unhealthy just because they are disabled, and\nwithout overemphasizing the correction or mitigation of impairments.\nThis requires a careful examination of the relationship between health\nand disability. Do all disabilities result from, or in, a loss of\nhealth? Can a person with a disability be in good or even\n\u201cperfect\u201d health? To answer such questions, we need a\nserviceable theory, concept, or definition of health.\n\nThere are a variety of competing philosophical accounts of health (see\n SEP entry on concepts of health and disease).\n They can be distinguished in several ways: 1) some regard health as\nthe mere absence of disease (e.g., Hofman 2005); others regard health\nas a form of well-being or flourishing, and treat the absence of\ndisease as at most a necessary condition of health (e.g., Carel 2007\nand WHO 1948); 2) some regard the concept of health as value-laden, or\nnormative, in the sense that the good of health enters into its very\nconcept (e.g., Engelhardt 1986; DeVito 2000); others regard health as\nvalue-neutral, or non-normative, defined by bio-statistical or other\nbiological criteria (e.g., Boorse 1987 and Wachbroit 1998); 3) some\nsee the value of health as instrumental, in the capacity of the agent\nor organism to achieve certain goals (e.g., Nordenfeldt 1995); others\nsee its value as intrinsic as well, as good in itself (e.g., Becker\n2005).\n\nThese distinctions are not independent of each other. Non-normative\naccounts of health tend to treat health as the absence of disease,\ndysfunction, or deformity. These accounts also tend to be\ninstrumental: they define health as normal or species-typical\nbiological functioning, which is itself defined in such goal-oriented\nterms as survival and reproduction. On the other hand, instrumental\naccounts that define health in terms of the pursuit of an\nindividually, culturally, or other variable range of goals will tend\nto weaken the connection of health to bodily, cognitive, or affective\nfunctioning.\n\nIf health is defined simply as the absence of disease, then a person\ncan be disabled but healthy if and only if he can be disabled but not\ndiseased. If, however, health is a state of psychophysical flourishing\nor vitality, then an individual can be healthy, although perhaps not\nperfectly healthy, even if disabled or diseased, and unhealthy even if\nfree of disability or disease.\n\nMany philosophers and bioethicists take it that \u201chealth\u201d,\n\u201cdisease\u201d, and \u201cdisability\u201d are value-laden,\nthat it is part of their meaning that the conditions to which they\nrefer are (inherently) desirable or undesirable (e.g., Engelhardt 1986\nand DeVito 2000). Two notable exceptions are Christopher Boorse and\nRobert Wachbroit, who offer biomedical definitions that are\nvalue-neutral, or as Boorse claims, as value-neutral as biology itself\n(Boorse 1987: 359\u201393; Wachbroit 1998: 533\u201338). They define\nhealth in terms of normal or species-typical physical and mental\nfunctioning, so that disabilities are by definition unhealthy. But\nsuch value-neutral accounts do not assume that disabilities are\ntherefore bad or undesirable, merely\n atypical.[2]\n\nSince they deny that the goodness of health is part of its definition,\nvalue-neutral accounts stress the enormous, but contingent,\ninstrumental value of health. The leading attempt to explain the\nimportance of health in these terms is Daniels\u2019 account of\nhealth-care as maintaining or restoring fair equality of opportunity\n(Daniels 1985). Daniels\u2019 account gives a priority to the\nmaintenance of typical functioning and the correction of disabilities\nthat many critics find excessive (Wasserman 1998: 152\u201358).\nStill, the core intuition, concerning the enormous practical value of\nspecies-typical functioning, can be accepted without accepting medical\nnormalization as the preferred or default response to atypicality;\nindeed, without accepting the claim that species have functions with\nspecies- typical levels defined in biological terms (see Amundson\n2000). Further, the claim that species-typical functioning is\ninstrumentally valuable leaves open the question of why\ndepartures from species-typical functioning are instrumentally\ndisvaluable: is it because they render one vulnerable to\ndiscrimination, subject one to an unaccommodating environment, cause\nmedical problems, or all of the above?\n\nYet most people have a strong conviction that practical advantages do\nnot exhaust the value of health, nor practical disadvantages its\ndisvalue. To accommodate this conviction, those accepting a narrow\ndefinition of health as the absence of disease may want to acknowledge\nthat disease, or its usual symptoms or consequences, has inherent\ndisvalue, while distinguishing disability from the other symptoms or\nconsequences of disease, particularly pain and death. Those adopting a\nbroader definition of health as an aspect of well-being or flourishing\nmay also want to claim that being unhealthy has inherent disvalue,\nwhile distinguishing disability from a lack of health.\n2.1 The First Approach: Distinguishing Disability from Disease\n\nThe distinction between disease and disability has received\nsurprisingly little attention in the philosophical literature. Most\nstatutory and other official definitions either treat serious diseases\nas disabilities or make \u201cimpairment\u201d, \u201closs of\nfunction\u201d, or \u201cstructural/functional abnormality\u201d an\nelement of disability, leaving the relationship of disease to\ndisability unclear (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990 or\nDisability Discrimination Act, 1995). One of the few detailed analyses\nof the relationship between disease and disability was offered by Ron\nAmundson, who proposed that disability should be understood as one of\nthe three general consequences of disease, along with pain and death\n(Amundson 1992: 105\u2013119). Amundson adopted Boorse\u2019s\nvalue-neutral account of health, but argued that Boorse defined\n\u201cdisease\u201d too broadly, as a \u201cdeviation from the\nfunctional organization of typical members of a species\u201d\u2014a\ndefinition which would encompass most disabilities. Amundson contended\nthat it was both clearer and closer to common usage to treat disease\nas an atypical process that tended to result in disability, pain, or\n death.[3]\n\nAmundson defined disability as the loss or deviation from a particular\nkind of species-typical function: action at the personal level, e.g.,\nthe inability to move one\u2019s arm, as opposed to the inability to\nmetabolize sugar. Disabilities that are not products of a process that\nleads to pain, death, or further impairment are not symptomatic of\ndisease in Amundson\u2019s sense. They are consistent with health\nnarrowly defined. Yet some philosophers (Hausman 2001: 254) find the\nnotion that individuals can be in excellent health if they are blind,\ndeaf, or paraplegic sufficiently implausible to count against analyses\nof health with that implication.\n\nThe disagreement between Amundson and Boorse on the distinction\nbetween disease and disability is not just a matter of semantics. The\ncritical point in Amundson\u2019s analysis is a practical one.\nMedical interventions are the presumptive response to disease; they\nseek to slow, arrest, or reverse processes that cause pain and may\nlead to physiological dysfunction, (further) disability (in\nAmundson\u2019s terms), or death. But on Amundson\u2019s view, which\nmakes disability consistent with health, the presumptive response to\ndisability need not be medical as opposed to environmental or social.\nFurthermore, the loss of opportunity associated with disabilities can\noften be prevented or mitigated more effectively and (in the long run)\nmore economically by modifying the physical and social environment\nthan by medical intervention. This is true even though environmental\nmeasures are likely to fare poorly against medical interventions in\nthe competition for scarce resources, because of the prestige and\nperceived importance of medical treatment. The failure to distinguish\ndisease and disability, and the tendency to favor a medical response\nfor both, reflects the sway of the medical model, and offers a clear\nillustration of how it differs from the social model (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).\n\nRecently, Peter Hucklenbroich has proposed a harm-oriented account of\nhealth as the absence of a \u201cdisease\u201d process. Such a\nprocess is pathological in the sense that:\n\nit is immediately lethal or definitely life-shortening, [or]\nit is a condition of pain, suffering, or other specific\ncomplaints, [or]\nit is a condition of infertility (incapability of biological\nreproduction), [or]\nit is a condition of inability or impairment for living together\nin human symbiotic communities, [or]\nit is a non-universal disposition of the organism to develop a\ncondition that is pathological according to one or more of these\ncriteria.\n (12)[4]\n\n\nHucklenbroich\u2019s account defines health in terms of a list of\nreasonably health-specific harms and it restricts health to the\nabsence of biological conditions that either (a) directly\ninvolve harm or (b) dispose one to suffer harm.\n\nAn account along these lines may have the potential to distinguish\ndisease from disability so as to make the former immediately relevant\nto well-being in a way the latter is not. Unlike purely non-normative\naccounts, it only finds a health-decrement where something bad comes\nfrom the state of the body. Unlike capaciously normative accounts, it\ndefines these \u201cbads\u201d in terms of a general and\nhealth-specific harm; not just any body-based limitation on the\npursuit of our (potentially idiosyncratic) goals makes us unhealthy.\nAnd finally, defining health in terms of bodily dispositions\ncould help to explain why extrinsic factors, like those cited by\nsocial models of disability, are irrelevant to health. It could\ndistinguish between harms that come from social responses to the body\nfrom harms that come from the body itself; thereby distinguishing\nbetween harms that generate claims on health care and harms that\ngenerate claims against discrimination or the denial of fair equality\nof opportunity.\n\nDespite the importance of distinguishing disease from disability,\nthere are at least three reasons why it is difficult to do so. First,\nas noted above, many or most diseases are defined as disabilities by\ndisability discrimination laws or their judicial and administrative\ninterpretations; they are subject to the same legal protections and\nrequirements of reasonable accommodation as \u201cAmundsonian\u201d\ndisabilities. This legal treatment may, however, be justifiable,\nbecause some diseases, such as AIDS, are stigmatized as severely as\nmany or most disabilities. Second, many disabilities, such as the\ninability to walk, may be associated with diseases, such as MS, which\nhave a progressive character, causing pain and further impairment, and\nsometimes increasing the risk of death (Wendell 2001).[5]\n Third, a society such as our own, where atypical functionings are\noften not well accommodated, accords a higher priority to the\nprevention or treatment of some non-fatal diseases than would a\nsociety that better accommodated them.\n2.2 The Second Approach: Health as More or Other than the Absence of Disease\n\nAn alternative approach to the relationship between health and\ndisability involves a broad or positive conception of health as more\nthan, or distinct from, the absence of disease or disability.\nThis approach has more and less instrumental versions. The former is\nrepresented by Nordenfelt\u2019s account of health as the ability of\nan individual to reach her \u201cvital goals\u201d\u2014those whose\nachievement is independently necessary and jointly sufficient for\nminimal happiness (Nordenfeldt 1995). On such an instrumental account,\nthe relationship of disability to health depends on the goals that are\nconsidered vital or central and on the role of typical functions in\nachieving them. Some impairments will hinder the pursuit of some goals\n(goal-based accounts of health vary in whether or how they specify the\nrelevant environment(s) affecting their pursuit), other impairments\nwill have no effect, and some will enhance the pursuit of\nsome goals. Any generalizations about the impact of impairments on\nhealth will depend on the assessment of their net effect on the\npursuit of the specified goals.\n\nThe breadth of an instrumental approach is apparent in Sridhar\nVenkatapuram\u2019s variation on Nordenfeldt, which replaces the\nlatter\u2019s mix of universal and personal \u201cvital goals\u201d\nwith the \u201cbasic capabilities for minimal happiness\u201d, as\nenumerated by Martha Nussbaum. \u201cWhat is important\u201d,\nVenkatapuram maintains, is \u201cthe idea of health as the capability\nto achieve a cluster of basic capabilities and functionings\u201d\n(277). Far from denying\nthat this conception resembles the much-ridiculed 1948 WHO definition\nof health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social\nwell-being\u201d, Venkatapuram just alters that definition to refer\nto a capability for minimal well-being. Nor does he\nshirk from the practical implications of this conception: \n\n\n\u201cHealth policy and expertise will have to encompass all the\ndeterminants of the core human capabilities that constitute a\nminimally decent life\u201d (278). \n\n\nAt the same time, he recognizes a narrower conception of health,\ntreating it as one of the more specific capabilities that health in\nhis broader conception encompasses. Health in this narrow sense is\njust the capacity to avoid disease and impairment. But it is unclear\nwhy even health in this narrow sense should be a constituent of\nwell-being, given the fact of human mortality and vulnerability. \n\nLawrence Becker has proposed a broad but less instrumental conception\nof health, examining positive conceptions of health in other\ndisciplines, specifically models of positive mental health in\npsychology, which incorporate notions such as resilience, robustness,\ndevelopmental maturity, character strength, and subjective well-being\n(Becker 2005). Such conceptions go beyond the absence of disease in\ntwo ways: they are positive, requiring psychophysical\nvitality\u2014robustness, vigor, and resilience\u2014and they are\nbroad, concerned not merely with biomedical functioning but with more\ncomprehensive well-being.\n\nMore recently, Becker (2012) argues for \u201cbasic good\nhealth\u201d as the metric for \u201cbasic justice\u201d. For\nBecker, basic good health is defined in interactive terms, as\n\u201creliably competent physical and psychological functioning in a\ngiven environment\u201d (2012: 45). As David Crocker (2013) observes,\nthis notion \n\n\nhas both negative and positive elements. The negative dimension\nincludes absence of disease, illness, disability, and other\nimpairments. The positive aspect is \u2026 \u201drobustly active\nagency. To be healthy is to have a kind of agency appropriate to the\nstages on life\u2019s way\u2014from infancy to mature adulthood to\nold age. \n\n\nThis positive aspect of basic good health, if not the notion as a\nwhole, gives support and structure to the claim that one can be\ndisabled but healthy. It could also promote the development of health\ninterventions for people with disabilities that are not directed at\nthe normalization of their atypical or impaired functions. One\nchallenge for this approach is to limit the scope of positive health,\nso that it does not encompass all aspects of well-being, but remains\nanchored in biomedical functioning. A second challenge for this\napproach is to explain how cognitive and affective conditions bear on\nhealth, and how any adverse effects of such conditions can be\nmitigated or eliminated without medical normalization.\n3. Personal Relations, Family, and Disability\n\nAlthough the connection between disability and interpersonal\nrelationships is a topic worth exploring in its own right, it also has\nimportant implications for well-being and health. Numerous empirical\nstudies across a number of behavioral science and medical disciplines\nhave shown the importance of close interpersonal relationships for\nhealth and well-being (Cohen, Gottlieb, and Underwood 2001; Uchino,\nCacioppo and Kiecolt-Glaser 1996; Cohen and Wills 1985). For example,\nmore than 130 empirical studies have shown that on a number of\nwell-being indices, married men and women are generally happier and\nless stressed than unmarried people (Coombs 1991). Personal\nrelationships, including love and friendship, are for most people an\nessential ingredient of the life they want for themselves, something\nto value for their own sake as well as for the support they provide\nduring stressful times. However, many people see disability as an\nobstacle to friendship, romantic love, and rewarding family life.\nDisability scholars and activists reject this widespread belief,\narguing that the obstacles that exist to accessing such relationships\nare due primarily to features of the social and physical\nenvironment.\n\nIn this section, we discuss the perceived barriers to such\nrelationships. Clearly, one\u2019s view about the effect of\ndisability on interpersonal relationships depends on one\u2019s\nconception of disability and on one\u2019s conception of the relevant\ninterpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love. As is\nevident from the discussions in the \u201cFriendship\u201d and\n\u201cLove\u201d entries in this encyclopedia, there is lively\ndebate among philosophers concerning the nature and value of love and\nfriendship.\n3.1 The Nature of Personal Relationships\n\nThe term \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d encompasses relationships\nof widely varying sorts. We will focus on relationships typically\nunderstood as enduring and in some way intimate: between parents and\nchildren, siblings, friends, and committed partners. In that respect,\nour conception of personal relationships is narrower than the broad\nconception of a relationship that figures in some of the literature on\nrelational egalitarian theories of justice (see, for example, Anderson\n2010; though for a principle of relational egalitarianism that is\nderived from consideration of what spouses owe one another, see\nScheffler 2014). The close relationships we have in mind\u2014whether\nof friendship, partnership, or family\u2014involve some degree of\nmutual regard, personal disclosure, and particularized knowledge. They\nalso involve material and emotional mutuality, but need not involve\nequal exchanges between the parties. \n\nPhilosophers have often treated equality of some kind as a\nprerequisite of friendship (see\n SEP entry on friendship).\n In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle distinguished among\nthree kinds of friendship: friendships of pleasure, of utility, and of\nvirtue. The last, the highest or truest form, required similarity of\ncharacter. Philosophers since Aristotle have rejected some of his\nprerequisites for friendship, such as equality of social or economic\nstatus, but they have shared his view that friendship must be a\nrelationship among equals. The debate has largely focused on the kind\nof equality that is required. Thus, Aristotle denied that parents and\ntheir children could ever be true friends, since the inequality\nbetween them could never be overcome no matter how much the child does\nfor his parents. This position is rejected by English (1979) and\nKristjansson (2006). Generally, contemporary accounts of friendship\nplace less emphasis on equality or similarity of specific traits and\nmore on equality of respect, investment, and commitment. Given the\nvast range of differences among close friends in talents, interests,\nand tangible contributions, it would not seem that disabilities pose\nany general barrier to intimacy. \n\nNevertheless, philosophers and bioethicists have tended to look\nskeptically on the possibility that a person with a disability could\noffer the mutuality and equality required for a satisfying\nrelationship with a nondisabled friend, romantic partner, or family\nmember. Even in those relationships where unequal contributions and\nasymmetric dependence are the norm, as with parents and their\nchildren, a child\u2019s disability has been seen as an obstacle to a\ndesirable and rewarding relationship. The disability is perceived as\ncreating an uncomfortable degree of inequality and dissimilarity;\nparents have difficulty picturing the child growing into a productive\nadult and parent, fulfilling some of the goals people have for\nundertaking childrearing (Ruddick 1998). Additionally, the\nchild\u2019s disability has been viewed as imposing burdens on\nparents that differ from and greatly exceed those posed by raising\nchildren who do not have disabilities (Botkin 1995). Moreover, the\nchild\u2019s disability is presumed to extend the duration of\nparental care (Botkin 1995; Kittay 1999; Lindemann and Nelson 2008).\nSimilarly, when the bioethics literature considers people with\ndisabilities as parents, it is largely to assess whether it will be\nharmful for children to be raised by disabled parents (Coleman 2002;\nRobertson 2004); or whether adult children will have to give up their\nother life projects to care for their newly-disabled parents (Callahan\n1988). \n\nIn this literature, relationships involving disabled people are\nchiefly viewed from the perspective of those without disabilities.\nWhether the topic is end-of-life decision making (Hardwig 2000),\ntreatment decisions for low birth weight, premature or otherwise\ndisabled newborns (Stack 1987), the rehabilitation of persons after\ntraumatic brain injury (Nelson and Frader 2004), or selection for or\nagainst disabling traits in embryos or fetuses (Botkin 1995; Ruddick\n2000; Green 2008), the focus is on how nondisabled people are affected\nby a (potential) relationship with someone who has a disability. What\nis largely missing from these accounts is serious consideration of the\nperspective of the person with a disability; of how her life will be\naffected, for good or ill, by the family or friendship relationships\nin which she is embedded. In addition, little attention is paid to\nrelationships in which all involved parties have disabilities. As\nChappell (1994) has noted, writers assume that it is in the interest\nof people with disabilities to aspire to relationships with\nnondisabled people, even if it is not is the interest of the latter.\nIt seems clear that if the consequences of personal relationships for\nthe flourishing of persons with disabilities were given the same\nweight as the consequences for nondisabled persons, it would encourage\na deeper and fuller appreciation of the goods of personal\nrelationships. \n3.2 Peer Relationships: Friendship and Love\n\nAt the heart of the negative portrayal of disability\u2019s impact on\ninterpersonal relationships is the presumed inequality imposed on the\nrelationship when one participant has a disability but others do not.\nThe type of inequality and its explanation are not always made\nexplicit. Does it result from the (perceived) inability of people with\ndisabilities to participate in activities that are important to some,\nmost, or all friendships? Or does it arise from the (perceived) need\non the part of the person with a disability for technological or human\nassistance to manage typical life tasks? Does it stem from a belief\nthat the person with a disability does not possess the social or\npsychological resources to prove a stimulating and rewarding friend?\n\n\nThe influence of a dichotomous conception of disability, that is, of a\nconception of disability as a personal attribute one either has or\nlacks, is evident even in the way questions about disability and\npersonal relationships are framed. In asking questions like \u201cAre\nrelationships between disabled and nondisabled people necessarily\nunequal?\u201d we tend to assume that disability is a categorical\ncharacteristic: that there is a distinct subset of the population that\nis disabled and everyone else is nondisabled. If, instead, we adopted\nthe human variation model of disability (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience),\n we could reframe such questions. That model conceives of an\nimpairment as an arbitrary range on the continuum of variation for a\nhuman attribute. Moreover, the model sees disability as an interaction\nbetween atypical functioning or embodiment and an unaccommodating\nenvironment. Consequently, it emphasizes that most people are\n\u201cdisabled\u201d in some particular physical or social context,\ninsofar as they have some atypical characteristic which fits poorly in\nthat context. The model also suggests that a disability, like an\nimpairment, ought to be considered as a graduated characteristic: just\nas there are degrees of functioning, there are degrees of fit between\nfunctioning-embodiment and social environment. \n\nOn this view, the question \u201cAre relationships between disabled\nand nondisabled people problematically unequal?\u201d would be better\nreformulated as \n\nIs there a positive correlation between the degree to which the\nparties to a relationship differ in overall level of disability, on\nthe one hand, and the degree of problematic interpersonal inequality,\non the other? \n\nAlthough this is largely an empirical question and cannot be answered\nby philosophical reflection alone, philosophy can clarify the concepts\nthat figure in the question: what is it to have a disability, what\nsorts of equality matter in valuable interpersonal relationships, and\nis there a reason, given what disability is and what sorts of equality\nmatter, to think ex ante that such a correlation would\nexist?\n\nOne reason having or acquiring a physical, intellectual, or emotional\ndisability lessens the chances that relationships will move beyond\nacquaintanceship is that the disability looms so large in the minds of\nthe nondisabled person (and perhaps the disabled person as well) that\nit obscures or eclipses other features on which an intimate\nrelationship can be solidly grounded. Most people do not yet see\ndisability as one among many characteristics with respect to which\nhumans can vary. In this way, one aspect of a person comes to dominate\nthe whole, an aspect of stigmatization that elsewhere we have\ndescribed as \u201csynecdoche\u201d (Asch and Wasserman 2005).\n3.3 Romantic Love and Sexual Intimacy\n\nThese points apply as well to the relationship between disability and\nromantic and sexual intimacy. This aspect of romantic leave can\namplify the concerns of people already skeptical about the ability of\npersons with disabilities to contribute to thriving friendships. Many\nnondisabled people may doubt that people with disabilities can be\nfulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. Prominent\nexplanations of love, again based in Aristotle, hold that having\nloving relationships promotes self-knowledge, insofar as one\u2019s\nbeloved acts as a kind of mirror, reflecting back one\u2019s\ncharacter (see SEP entries on\n love\n and\n friendship).\n Many nondisabled people may find it hard to imagine seeing their\nreflection in a disabled partner. According to LaFollette (1996),\nlove, at least ideally, brings out the best in the participants. For\nnondisabled people, it may be hard to see past the impairment to\nimagine that a partner with a disability can bring out their best, be\nsimilar enough to understand them, enhance their self-worth, or meet\ntheir deepest needs. \n\nDisability creates a number of challenges to forging intimate physical\nand emotional relationships. People with sensory-motor impairments who\nwere disabled beginning in early life often report that they were\nsocially segregated from other children, either directly because they\nwere tracked into different classes or different schools, or\nindirectly because other students avoided them. Consequently, many\ndisabled children have not been socialized about sex in the way other\nchildren have been: even playground misinformation can play a role in\ndeveloping and affirming a sense of nascent sexual identity in\nable-bodied children, yet disabled children are often excluded from\nthis process. To make matters worse, many disabled children do not\nreceive sex education until a much later age than their able-bodied\npeers (if at all), a reflection of the pervasive stereotype that\ndisabled people are infantile and asexual (Shakespeare 1996). \n\nThese challenges persist into adulthood. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with other adults, cultural stereotypes and\nprejudices continue to exact a high cost. Disabled people are often\nexpected to be \u201cwith their own kind\u201d, and if they do form\nintimate relationships with unimpaired people, they must confront\npatronizing assumptions about the \u201creal\u201d reasons for the\nrelationship: dependency, pity, etc.. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with one another, they must overcome\npsychological barriers to intimacy that result from society\u2019s\nviews about what an appropriate partner would be or what acceptable\nsexual activity is. Or they must battle family opposition to being\nwith a partner whose similar or different disability prevents that\npartner from assuming the role of \u201ccaregiver\u201d or personal\nassistant. Emens (2009) shows how institutional practices, along with\nphysical and communication barriers, perpetuate and reinforce\nprevailing views that people with disabilities will be incapable of\nparticipating in sexual and partner relationships. \n\nFor various reasons, people with intellectual disabilities have been\nthought incapable of understanding and appreciating the value of\nromantic, sexual, or partner relationships. But as first-person\nnarratives attest, disabled people have grown quite adept at\nnavigating and even overcoming these challenges (Shakespeare 1996).\nNarratives and research demonstrate that even people with\ndevelopmental disabilities or dementia can and often do consent to\nmutual, sustained sexual relations (Kaeser 1992). This is not to deny,\nobviously, that some disabled people lack the cognitive abilities\nnecessary to genuinely consent to sex.\n3.4 Parenting and Disability\n\nThe assumption that people with disabilities will not be able to enter\ninto intimate relationships, or will impose onerous burdens on their\nintimates, may play a significant role in the routinization of\nprenatal testing and abortion for disability. The reluctance of many\nparents to have a disabled child often rests on an exaggerated view of\nthe physical and emotional demands of raising such children, or on a\nfailure to appreciate the capacities of such children to form\nrewarding parent-child relationships. The latter is likely to play a\nmajor role in the strength of the desire to avoid having a child with\na serious cognitive impairment. Indeed, surveys show that prospective\nparents are far more reluctant to have a child with a cognitive or\naffective impairment than a sensory or motor impairment (Wertz 1998).\n\n This reluctance may also rest to a great extent on the\noverwhelming salience of the impairment in a setting where little else\ncan be known about the future child. That salience reinforces the\nalready-powerful tendency to see only the stigmatized trait. Botkin\nmay express the dominant view among prospective parents in arguing\nthat the burden of raising a child with a disability should be treated\nas equivalent to the burden of raising an unwanted child (Botkin 1995:\n32\u201339).  Ferguson argues that the findings from research and\nfrom parent narratives in the past thirty years contradict such\nassertions and demonstrate that families with a child who has a\ndisability look much like other families in terms of satisfaction,\nstress, and system functioning (Ferguson 2001: 373\u201395). Other\nresearch suggests that raising children with severe cognitive and\nother disabilities has greater stresses but similar rewards\n(Aschbrenner, et al. 2010; Blacher and Baker 2007; Gerstein et\nal. 2009).\n\nProspective parents with disabilities are less likely to be encumbered\nby these stereotypes about disabled children, but they may believe\nthat their disabilities have been sufficiently difficult for them that\nthey do not want to pass them on to their children. Moreover, even if\ntheir impairment is not genetic and they are likely to become the\nbiological parent of a child without a disability, they must struggle\nwith deeply-rooted skepticism about their own ability to parent\ndisabled or nondisabled children. If one of the most pervasive\nassumptions about disability is its association with a need for help\nor \u201ccare\u201d from others, the person with a disability may\nthink herself incapable of doing so for others.\n\nThe prospect of parenting by people with disabilities provides an\nopportunity to consider the question of which components of customary\nparent-child relationships are essential to good parenting (Blustein\n1982; Ruddick 1998; O\u2019Neill 2002). Parents with disabilities,\nparticularly cognitive disabilities, are often regarded as unfit to\nmeet the \u201cspecial needs\u201d of disabled children, and\nincapable of serving as mentors and role models for nondisabled\nchildren. Although some judicial decisions, empirical reports, and\npersonal narratives recognize that many people with physical, sensory,\naffective, and cognitive impairments can effectively raise children\nalone or with some assistance, daily life, social service agencies,\nand attitudes of professionals and the public still thwart people with\ndisabilities in their parenting goals (Collings and Llewellyn\n2012; Picciuto 2015). However, social attitudes\nare gradually changing as examples of successful parenting by people\nwith disabilities proliferate (Mutcherson 2008).\n3.5 Personal relationships and third-party assistance\n\nDisability theorists and activists reject the assumption that\ndisabilities pose unique difficulties for personal relationships on\nthe grounds that this assumption reflects an overly narrow view of the\nmutuality required in an intimate relationship. That said, not all\npersons with and without disabilities have the same views about\npossibility of combining intimacy with disability-specific personal\nassistance. To accommodate these differences, some theorists and\nactivists have argued for options that separate instrumental\nassistance from close relationships. These options involve providing\nby paid staff for personal assistance in cases where this helps to\npreserve the mutuality, sharing, and interdependence of friendships,\npartner relations, and family life (Litvak et al. 1987; Asch 1993;\nRatzka 2004). There is much to be said in favor of making third-party\nassistance available. The lack of education and training of family\nmembers in meeting a person\u2019s disability-related needs, the\nsocietal treatment of these needs as different from and more shameful\nthan other needs, and the scarcity and inaccessibility of other\nsupportive services for meeting these needs, can indeed place enormous\nstrain on intimate relationships between nondisabled and disabled\npersons. Further, the constant reliance upon intimates for assistance\nwith travel, communication, or preparation for work or school may\nthwart the desires of persons with disabilities to select what they\nwear, when they come and go, or with whom they associate in their free\ntime. The idea of an entitlement to state-subsidized personal\nassistance has been developed on a policy level by Litvak, Heumann,\nand Zukas (1987), Adolf Ratzka (2004), and Americans Disabled For\nAttendant Programs Today (ADAPT). \n\nIt might be thought that the argument for state-subsidized personal\nassistance undermines the claim that disability does not pose any\ngeneral barriers to intimacy. Those arguing that the state should\nsubsidize personal assistance for people with disabilities might seem\nto share the assumption of Callahan (1988) and Wertz and Fletcher\n(1993) that disability-related needs differ in kind as well as in\ndegree from other material and emotional needs for which\nstate-subsidized assistance is not defended.\n\nDisability advocates would reject this conclusion for at least two\nreasons. First, it is the stigmatization of disability-related needs,\nmore than the actual cost of meeting them, which serves as a barrier\nto intimacy. The stigmatization of disability-related needs creates an\naversion to meeting those needs and a tendency to exaggerate the costs\nof doing so. There is an inclination to see meeting those needs as\nfalling outside the scope of an intimate relationship, when meeting\nrelevantly similar needs of a nondisabled relative are seen as part\nand parcel of intimate relating. By subsidizing personal assistance,\nthe state helps to overcome the exclusionary effects of deeply\nentrenched social attitudes that pose a barrier to intimacy. If these\nattitudes change so that the dominant culture does not find it\nshameful to have disability-specific needs and distasteful to meet\nthem, there might well be less need for personal assistance programs.\nThe remaining need for personal assistance would not sharply\ndistinguish persons with disabilities from friends and intimates who\nalso call upon each other for various forms of assistance.\n\nSecond, the fact that some people with disabilities require more\nassistance than most nondisabled people to achieve their life goals\ndoes not mean that disabilities must pose a barrier to intimacy.\nIntimate relationships often impose special demands on participants\nunrelated to disability. An individual with expensive projects or\ncommitments may cost significantly more to befriend or marry, but\nunless those projects and commitments are extravagant or\nall-consuming, we would not see them as a general barrier to intimacy.\nLikewise, even in an Internet age, it may be more costly to maintain\nfriendships with people who live in remote areas. Yet we tend to see\nthose costs as incidental to the relationships we form, even if they\nlimit them in ways we may regret (Amundson 2005).\n\nA state-subsidized personal assistance response to disability-related\nneeds is not welcomed by all disability theorists and activists.\nWendell (1989, 1996) sees people with disabilities, in their\ndependence, as having lessons to teach nondisabled people about human\ninterdependence. Similarly, Eva Kittay has argued for the importance\nof kinship caregiving. Kittay stresses the importance of a loving and\n\u201csustaining\u201d relationship between the caregiver and the\ncare-recipient, which may be absent when care is professionally\noutsourced. Moreover, family caregivers are more likely to maintain\ntrusting and long-lasting relationships, as opposed to professional\ncaregivers, who may come and go. Furthermore, Kittay stresses the\nsignificance of including disabled people in familial and cultural\nactivities rather than relegating them to paid caregivers, although it\nis not clear why having a paid assistant is inimical to participating\nin familial and communal activities (Kittay 2003). (See also Longmore\n1995 and Levine 2004.).\n\nThese arguments about the value of kinship caregiving do not undermine\nthe case for making professional caregiving relationships a dignified\nand economically viable option. There are many families ill-equipped\nor poorly disposed to adopt that option. But there are also many\ncircumstances in which the differentiation of personal assistant from\nparent, spouse, or friend will give the person with a disability the\nfreedom and privacy that nondisabled people take for granted. In\ncircumstances where kinship assistance would strain rather than\nenhance intimate relationships between family members, it seems clear\nthat third-party assistance should at least be made available as an\noption, even if it is not encouraged across-the-board. \n\nSubsidizing third-party assistance is a means by which the state can\nhelp to create the conditions for the flourishing of positive\nrelationships. The provision of paid third-party assistance is not\nintended to force the separation of instrumental help from close\nrelationships, but to give friends and family members the freedom to\ndecide how much of such assistance they want to incorporate into their\nrelationships. Friends and family members may be entirely comfortable\nmeeting someone\u2019s disability-specific needs, just as they are\nprepared to meet other needs of the people with whom they have\nintimate relationships (Asch 1993). In other cases, and with respect\nto other needs, they may not. Close relationships are not all of a\npiece, and persons with disabilities, their friends, family members,\nand lovers should be able to determine for themselves what kind of\nrelationship they will have and what role there is in it for\nthird-party assistance.\n4. Conclusion\n\nHaving separately discussed well-being, health, and personal\nrelationship, the Entry concludes by considering the links among these\nthree domains, as they pertain to disability.\n\nOn most plausible accounts of well-being, health and personal\nrelationships are either instrumentally conducive to well-being or\npartially constitutive of it. An account of well-being which entailed\nthat health and personal relationships were not important means to or\nconstituents of well-being would be prima facie implausible.\nConsequently, an account of health entailing that persons with\ndisabilities are necessarily unhealthy, or an account of personal\nrelationships entailing that persons with disabilities cannot enjoy\nmany of the goods of those relationships, will also have the\nimplication that persons with disabilities cannot attain the same\nlevel of well-being as able-bodied persons absent\ncompensating capacities or achievements in other domains.\n\nMany laypersons, policymakers, and philosophers implicitly or\nexplicitly adopt theories of health and personal relationships with\nthis implication. But there are plausible accounts of health and\npersonal relationships which do not entail that disability is inimical\nto well-being. And on most plausible accounts of well-being,\ndisability need not present a formidable barrier to living a good\nlife. This is so on appropriately pluralistic, flexible and\nbroadly-framed objective-list accounts as well as on subjective\naccounts. A blind or deaf person cannot exercise all five senses. But\nthere are plausible arguments for the conclusion that they can have\nlives with rich aesthetic experience, pleasure, and joy.\n\nWe suggest that the difficulty in appreciating that people with\ndisabilities may have lives as good as those of people without\ndisabilities, objectively as well as subjectively, may arise in part\nfrom a failure of imagination by nondisabled people. A body of\nempirical research indicates that people without disabilities rate the\nsubjective well-being of people with disabilities far lower than they\nrate it themselves. (Albrecht and Devlieger 1999; Gill 2000; Goering\n2008). If all persons enjoy a defeasible presumption of epistemic\nauthority with respect to the quality of their experiences, this\ndivergence suggests that the widely shared assumption that\ndisabilities reduce quality of life should be regarded as\ncontroversial, not self-evident. Although we have no empirical\nresearch to support us, we suspect the same is true for the divergent\nassessments of the prospects for objective well-being of people with\ndisabilities. Non-disabled people may have greater difficulty\nimagining how people with disabilities can enjoy or develop the\ncapabilities for the various constituents of objective well-being,\nparticularly those concerning health and personal relationships.\n\nThis highlights a broader point connecting all three domains, as well\nas the relationship between philosophy and disability more generally.\nMost philosophical discussions of disability have implicitly assumed\nthe perspective of persons who do not have a disability. They have\nasked whether other people, the people with disabilities,\nhave lower levels of well-being; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, are less healthy; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, will pose a comparatively higher burden as friends or\nintimates. In much recent work in political philosophy, disability has\nfigured most prominently as a paradigm example of bad luck, and the\nquestion is whether and to what extent we the able-bodied should\ncompensate disabled others for their misfortune (see\n SEP entry on disability and justice).\n By implicitly adopting the perspective of nondisabled persons, from\nwhich persons with disabilities appear only in the third-person, much\nmainstream work in philosophy has failed to take seriously the\nperspectives of persons with disabilities\u2014even when those\nperspectives are directly relevant to the conceptual question under\ndiscussion: what is the nature of well-being, or friendship, or\nhealth? We hope that this entry can be a point of departure for a\ndiscussion of these concepts that takes into account a wider range of\nrelevant considered judgments, intuitions, and perspectives.",
