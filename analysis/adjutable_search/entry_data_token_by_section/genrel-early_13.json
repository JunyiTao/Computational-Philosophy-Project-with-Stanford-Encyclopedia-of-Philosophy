While\nthese discussions were largely, and understandably, confined to\nscientific circles, they nonetheless brought distinctly philosophical\nissues\u2014of methodology, but also of epistemology and\nmetaphysics\u2014together with technical matters. Einstein\u2019s\nmathematical representation of gravitational field potentials by the\nmetric tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) of a variably curved spacetime geometry\nwas quickly termed a \u201cgeometrization of gravitational\nforce\u201d. Weyl and others acclaimed Einstein as reviving a\ngeometrizing tendency essentially dormant within physics since the\n17th century. In so doing, Einstein supposedly opened up the prospect\nof a complete geometrization of physical theory, the possibility of\nfinding a unifying representation of all of known physical\ninteractions within the frame of a unique metrical theory of the\nfour-dimensional spacetime continuum. Einstein himself, as will be\nseen, turned out to be highly critical of the idea of\n\u201cgeometrizing physics\u201d even as the general theory of\nrelativity was its inspiration. This was certainly the case for the\nG\u00f6ttingen mathematician David Hilbert (1915, 1917). In the very\nweek in late November 1915 when Einstein presented his completed\ngravitational theory to the Berlin Academy (on Thursday), Hilbert (the\nprevious Monday) proposed to the G\u00f6ttingen Academy a schematic\ngenerally covariant axiomatization coupling Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory with a relativistic electromagnetic theory of\nmatter due to German physicist Gustav Mie. Hilbert\u2019s theory\ncould not possibly succeed (however, that matter is not fundamentally\nelectromagnetic in nature was only shown in the 1930s by the quantum\nphysics of the atomic nucleus). It is remembered today mostly for the\nso-called \u201cEinstein-Hilbert action\u201d in the usual\nvariational formulation of Einstein\u2019s theory. But at the time\nHilbert viewed his theory as a triumph of his \u201caxiomatic\nmethod\u201d as well as a demonstration that\n\n\nphysics is a four-dimensional pseudogeometry [i.e., a geometry\ndistinguishing spatial and temporal dimensions] whose metric\ndetermination \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is bound, according to the fundamental\nequations \u2026 of my first [1915] contribution, to the\nelectromagnetic quantities, that is, to matter. (1917: 63, translation\nby the author)\n\n\nHowever, this implied reduction of physics to geometry was crucially\nobtained within the epistemological frame of what Hilbert termed\n\u201cthe axiomatic method\u201d; its intended significance is that\nof a proposed solution to the 6th (\u201cthe axiomatization of\nphysics\u201d) of the famous 23 mathematical problems posed by\nHilbert at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris\n(Brading & Ryckman 2008). Others pursued a different path, seeking\nthe reduction of physics to geometry by generalizing beyond the\npseudo-Riemannian geometry (a Riemannian geometry distinguishing\nbetween space and time dimensions) of general relativity (Hermann\nWeyl, Arthur Stanley Eddington) or by employing Riemannian geometry in\nfive dimensions (Theodore Kaluza). Whatever may have been\nKaluza\u2019s philosophical motivations (van Dongen 2010:\n132\u20135), neither mathematical realism nor Platonism played a role\nin Weyl\u2019s (1918a,b), and following Weyl, Eddington\u2019s\n(1921) generalizations of Riemannian geometry. Their proposals were\nabove all explicit attempts to comprehend the nature of fundamental\nphysical theory in the light of general relativity, from systematic\nepistemological standpoints neither positivist nor realist. As such\nthey comprise early philosophical interpretations of that theory,\nalthough they intertwine philosophy, geometry and physics in a manner\nunprecedented since Descartes.\n\nAfter completing general relativity, Einstein long entertained hopes\nthat matter might be described in geometrical terms by a theory\nunifying gravitation and electromagnetism. But he stoutly and\nrepeatedly resisted proclamations of any reduction of physics to\ngeometry (e.g., 1928: 254; Giovanelli 2013a). Theoretical unification\nwas overriding goal; no special significance would accrue to any\nsuccessful unifying theory whose physical objects, motions, and\ninteractions are described in geometrical terms (Lehmkuhl 2014).\nEinstein nonetheless followed both approaches to theoretical\nunification, that of generalizing Riemannian geometry and by adding\nextra dimensions. By 1923, Einstein was the recognized leader of the\nunification program (Vizgin 1985 [1994: 265]) and by 1925 had devised\nhis first \u201chomegrown\u201d geometrical \u201cunified field\ntheories\u201d (Sauer 2014). The first phase of the geometrical\nunification program essentially ended with Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cdistant parallelism\u201d theory of 1928\u20131931 (e.g.,\n1929), an inadvertent public sensation (F\u00f6lsing 1993 [1997:\n605]). Needless to say, none of these efforts met with success. In a\nlecture at the University of Vienna on October 14, 1931, Einstein\nforlornly referred to his failed attempts, each conceived on a\ndistinct differential geometrical basis, as a \u201cgraveyard of dead\nhopes\u201d (Einstein 1932). By this time, certainly, the viable\nprospects for the geometrical unification program had considerably\nwaned. A consensus emerged among nearly all leading theoretical\nphysicists that while unification of the gravitation and\nelectromagnetic fields might be attained in formally distinct ways,\nthe problem of matter, treated with undeniable empirical success by\nthe new quantum theory, was not to be resolved solely within the\nconfines of classical fields and spacetime geometry. In any event,\nfrom the early 1930s, prospects of any type of unification program\nappeared greatly premature in view of the wealth of data produced by\nthe new physics of the nucleus.\n\nStill, unsuccessful pursuit of the goal of geometrical unification\nabsorbed Einstein and his various research assistants for more than\nthree decades, up to Einstein\u2019s death in 1955. In the course of\nit, Einstein\u2019s research methodology underwent a dramatic change\n(Ryckman 2014; Ryckman 2017: chapters 9 and 10). In place of\nphysically warranted principles to guide theoretical construction,\nsuch as the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass that\nhad set him on the path to his greatest success with general\nrelativity, Einstein increasingly relied on considerations of\nmathematical aesthetics, of \u201clogical simplicity\u201d, and the\ninevitability of certain mathematical structures under various\nconstraints, adopted essentially for philosophical reasons. In a talk\nentitled \u201cOn the Method of Theoretical Physics\u201d at Oxford\nin 1933, the transformation was stated dramatically:\n\n\nExperience remains, of course, the sole criterion of the physical\nutility of a mathematical construction. But the creative principle\nresides in mathematics. In a certain sense, therefore, I hold it true\nthat pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed. (1933:\n274)\n\n\nEven decades of accumulating empirical successes of the new quantum\ntheory did not dislodge Einstein\u2019s core metaphysical conception\nof physical reality as a continuous field (\u201ctotal field\u201d)\nwhere particles and the concept of motion are derived notions (e.g.,\n1950: 348).\n",
