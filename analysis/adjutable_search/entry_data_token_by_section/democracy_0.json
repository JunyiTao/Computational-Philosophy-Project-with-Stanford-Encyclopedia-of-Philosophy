    "main_text": "Democracy Defined\n1. Democracy Defined\n\nThe term \u201cdemocracy\u201d, as we will use it in this entry,\nrefers very generally to a method of collective decision making\ncharacterized by a kind of equality among the participants at an\nessential stage of the decision-making process. Four aspects of this\ndefinition should be noted. First, democracy concerns collective\ndecision making, by which we mean decisions that are made for groups\nand are meant to be binding on all the members of the group. Second,\nwe intend for this definition to cover many different kinds of groups\nand decision-making procedures that may be called democratic. So there\ncan be democracy in families, voluntary organizations, economic firms,\nas well as states and transnational and global organizations. The\ndefinition is also consistent with different electoral systems, for\nexample first-past-the-post voting and proportional representation.\nThird, the definition is not intended to carry any normative weight.\nIt is compatible with this definition of democracy that it is not\ndesirable to have democracy in some particular context. So the\ndefinition of democracy does not settle any normative questions.\nFourth, the equality required by the definition of democracy may be\nmore or less deep. It may be the mere formal equality of one-person\none-vote in an election for representatives to a parliament where\nthere is competition among candidates for the position. Or it may be\nmore robust, including substantive equality in the processes of\ndeliberation and coalition building leading up to the vote.\n\u201cDemocracy\u201d may refer to any of these political\narrangements. It may involve direct referenda of the members of a\nsociety in deciding on the laws and policies of the society or it may\ninvolve the participation of those members in selecting\nrepresentatives to make the decisions.\n\nThe function of normative democratic theory is not to settle questions\nof definition but to determine which, if any, of the forms democracy\nmay take are morally desirable and when and how. To evaluate different\nmoral justifications of democracy, we must decide on the merits of the\ndifferent principles and conceptions of human beings and society from\nwhich they proceed.\n",
