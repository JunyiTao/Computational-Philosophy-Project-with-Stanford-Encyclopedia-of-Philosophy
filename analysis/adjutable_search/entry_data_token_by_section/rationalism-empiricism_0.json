Introduction\n\nThe dispute between rationalism and empiricism takes place primarily\nwithin epistemology, the branch of philosophy devoted to studying the\nnature, sources, and limits of knowledge. Knowledge itself can be of\nmany different things and is usually divided among three main\ncategories: knowledge of the external world, knowledge of the internal\nworld or self-knowledge, and knowledge of moral and/or aesthetical\nvalues. We may find that there are category-specific conditions that\nmust be satisfied for knowledge to occur and that it is easier or more\ndifficult to shape certain questions and answers, depending on whether\nwe focus on the external world or on the values. However, some of the\ndefining questions of general epistemology include the following.\n\nWhat is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a\nparticular proposition about the world, ourselves, morality, or beauty\nis true?\n\nTo know a proposition, we must believe it and it must be true, but\nsomething more is required, something that distinguishes knowledge\nfrom a lucky guess. Let\u2019s call this additional element\n\u2018warrant\u2019. A good deal of philosophical work has been\ninvested in trying to determine the nature of warrant. \nHow can we gain knowledge?\n\nWe can form true beliefs just by making lucky guesses. How to gain\nwarranted beliefs is less clear. Moreover, to know the external world\nor anything about beauty, for instance, we must be able to think about\nthe external world or about beauty, and it is unclear how we gain the\nconcepts we use in thought or what assurance, if any, we have that the\nways in which we divide up the world using our concepts correspond to\ndivisions that actually exist. \nWhat are the limits of our knowledge?\n\nSome aspects of the external world, ourselves, or the moral and\naesthetical values may be within the limits of our thought but beyond\nthe limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of\nthem, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the\nexternal world, ourselves, or the moral and aesthetical values may\neven be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form\nintelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular\ndescription is true. \n\n\nThe disagreement between rationalism and empiricism primarily concerns\nthe second question, regarding the sources of our concepts and\nknowledge. In some instances, the disagreement on this topic results\nin conflicting responses to the other questions as well. The\ndisagreement may extend to incorporate the nature of warrant or where\nthe limits of our thought and knowledge are. Our focus here will be on\nthe competing rationalist and empiricist responses to the second\nquestion.\n\nThere are three main theses that are usually seen as relevant for\ndrawing the distinction between rationalism and empiricism, with a\nfocus on the second question. While the first thesis has been\ntraditionally seen as distinguishing between rationalism and\nempiricism, scholars now mostly agree that most rationalists and\nempiricists abide by the so-called Intuition/Deduction\nthesis, concerning the ways in which we become warranted in\nbelieving propositions in a particular subject area.\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction Thesis: Some propositions in a\nparticular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone;\nstill others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions.\n\n\nIntuition is a form of direct, immediate insight. Intuition has been\nlikened to (a sort of internal) perception by most rationalists and\nempiricists alike. Intellectually grasping a proposition, we just\n\u201csee\u201d it to be true in such a way as to form a true,\nwarranted belief in it. (As discussed in Section 2 below, the nature\nof this intellectual \u201cseeing\u201d needs explanation.)\nDeduction is a process in which we derive conclusions from intuited\npremises through valid arguments, ones in which the conclusion must be\ntrue if the premises are true. We intuit, for example, that the number\nthree is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from\nthis knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two.\nIntuition and deduction thus provide us with knowledge that is\nindependent, for its justification, of experience. This type of\nknowledge, since Kant, is commonly called \u201ca\npriori\u201d.\n\nWe can generate different versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis\nby substituting different subject areas for the variable\n\u2018S\u2019. Several rationalists and empiricists take mathematics\nto be knowable by intuition and deduction. Some place ethical truths\nin this category. Some include metaphysical claims, such as that God\nexists, we have free will, and our mind and body are distinct\nsubstances.\n\nThe second thesis that is relevant to the distinction between\nrationalism and empiricism is the Innate Knowledge\nthesis.\n\nThe Innate Knowledge Thesis: We have knowledge of some truths\nin a particular subject area, S, as part of our nature.\n\n\nThe Innate Knowledge thesis asserts the existence of knowledge whose\nsource is our own nature: we are born with this knowledge; it\ndoesn\u2019t depend, for its justification, on our accessing it via\nparticular experiences. Our innate knowledge is not learned through\neither experience or intuition/deduction. It is just part of our\nnature. Experiences may trigger a process by which we bring this\nknowledge to consciousness, but these experiences do not provide us\nwith the knowledge itself. It has in some way been with us all along.\nAccording to some rationalists, we gained the knowledge in an earlier\nexistence. According to others, God provided us with it at creation.\nStill others say it is part of our nature through natural\nselection.\n\nWe get different versions of the Innate Knowledge thesis by\nsubstituting different subject areas for the variable \u2018S\u2019.\nThe more subjects included within the range of the thesis or the more\ncontroversial the claim to have knowledge in them, the more radical\nthe form of rationalism. Stronger and weaker understandings of warrant\nyield stronger and weaker versions of the thesis as well. Empiricists\nreject this thesis: Locke, for instance, dedicates the whole first\nbook of the Essay to show that such knowledge, even if it\nexisted, would be of little use to us.\n\nThe third important thesis that is relevant to the distinction between\nrationalism and empiricism is the Innate Concept thesis.\n\nThe Innate Concept Thesis: We have some of the concepts we\nemploy in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational\nnature.\n\n\nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts are not\ngained from experience. They are part of our rational nature in such a\nway that, while sense experiences may trigger a process by which they\nare brought to consciousness, experience does not provide the concepts\nor determine the information they contain. Some claim that the Innate\nConcept thesis is entailed by the Innate Knowledge Thesis; a\nparticular instance of knowledge can only be innate if the concepts\nthat are contained in the known proposition are also innate. This is\nLocke\u2019s position (Essay, 1.4.1). Others, such as\nCarruthers, argue against this connection (1992, pp. 53\u201354). The\ncontent and strength of the Innate Concept thesis varies with the\nconcepts claimed to be innate. The more a concept seems removed from\nexperience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the\nmore plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not\nexperience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of\nthe former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our\nconcept of the latter.\n",
