    "main_text": "Why Is Discrimination Wrong? || The Wrongs of Direct Discrimination\n4.1 The Wrongs of Direct Discrimination\n\n\nSpecifying why direct discrimination is wrongful has proved to be a\nsurprisingly controversial and difficult task. There is general\nagreement that the wrong concerns the kind of reason or motive that\nguides the action of the agent of discrimination: the agent is acting\non a reason or motive that is in some way illegitimate or morally\ntainted. But there are more than a half-dozen distinct views about\nwhat the best principle is for drawing the distinction between acts of\ndirect discrimination (in the moralized sense) and those acts that are\nnot wrongful even though the agent takes account of another\u2019s\nsocial group membership.\n\n\nOne popular view is that direct discrimination is wrong because the\ndiscriminator treats persons on the basis of traits that are immutable\nand not under the control of the individual possessing them.  Thus,\nKahlenberg asserts that racial discrimination is unjust because race\nis such an immutable trait (1996: 54\u201355). And discrimination\nbased on many forms of disability would seem to fit this view. But\nBoxill rejects the view, arguing that there are instances in which it\nis justifiable to treat persons based on features that are beyond\ntheir control (1992: 12\u201317). Denying blind people a\ndriver\u2019s license is not an injustice to them.  Moreover, Boxill\nnotes that, if scientists developed a drug that could change a\nperson\u2019s skin color, it would still be unjust to discriminate\nagainst people because of their color (1992: 16).  Additionally, a\nparadigmatic ground of discrimination, a person\u2019s religion, is\nnot an immutable trait, nor are some forms of disability. Thus, there\nare serious problems with the popular view that direct discrimination\nis wrong due to the immutable nature of the traits on the basis of\nwhich the discriminator treats the persons whom he wrongs.\n\nA second view holds that direct discrimination is wrong because it\ntreats persons on the basis of inaccurate stereotypes. When the state\nof Virginia defended the male-only admissions policy of the Virginia\nMilitary Institute (VMI), it introduced expert testimony that there\nwas a strong correlation between sex and the capacity to benefit from\nthe highly disciplined and competitive educational atmosphere of the\nschool: those who benefited from such an atmosphere were, for the most\npart, men, while women had a strong tendency to thrive in a quite\ndifferent, cooperative educational environment. This defense involved\nthe premise that the school\u2019s admissions policy was not\ndiscriminatory because the policy relied on accurate generalizations\nabout men and women. And in its ruling against VMI, the Supreme Court\nheld that a public policy \u201cmust not rely on overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females\u201d (U.S. v. Virginia\n1996: 533). But the Court went on to argue that \u201cgeneralizations\nabout \u2018the way women are\u2019, estimates of what is\nappropriate for most women, no longer justify denying\nopportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the\naverage description\u201d (550; ital. in original). \n\n\nThe Court\u2019s reasoning implies that, even if gender were a very good\npredictor of the qualities needed to benefit from and be successful at\nthe school, VMI\u2019s admissions policy would still be\ndiscriminatory (Schauer 2003: 137\u2013141).  Accordingly, on the\nCourt\u2019s view, direct discrimination based on largely accurate\ngender generalizations can still be wrongful.  For example, consider a\nfire department whose policy is to reject all women applicants for the\njob of fire fighter, on the grounds that the vast majority of persons\nhaving the requisite physical strength for the job are men and that\nthe policy saves the department the time and expense of testing\npersons unlikely to meet the requirement.  Even if the gender\ngeneralization underlying the policy is accurate, it is clear that the\npolicy amounts to wrongful discrimination against women, depriving\nthem of their right to equal employment opportunity.  Thus, the\nwrongfulness cannot be explained simply by saying that the\ngeneralization is inaccurate. \n\n\nA third view is that direct discrimination is wrong because it is an\narbitrary or irrational way to treat persons. In other words, direct\ndiscrimination imposes a disadvantage on a person for a reason that is\nnot a good one, viz., that the person is a member of a certain salient\nsocial group. Accordingly, Cotter argues that such discrimination\ntreats people unequally \u201cwithout rational justification\u201d\n(2006: 10). Kekes expresses a similar view in condemning race-based\naffirmative action as \u201carbitrary\u201d (1995: 200), and, in the\nsame vein, Flew argues that racism is unjust because it treats persons\non the basis of traits that \u201care strictly superficial and\nproperly irrelevant to all, or almost all, questions of social status\nand employability\u201d (1990: 63\u201364).\n\n\nHowever, many thinkers reject this third view of the wrongness of\ndirect discrimination. Gardner argues that there is no\n\u201cacross-the-board-duty to be rational, so our irrationality\nas such wrongs no one.\u201d Additionally, Gardner contends that\n\u201cthere patently can be reasons, under some conditions,\nto discriminate on grounds of race or sex,\u201d even though the\nconduct in question is wrongful (1998: 168). For example, a\nrestaurant owner might rationally refuse to serve blacks if most of his\ncustomers are white racists who would stop patronizing the\nestablishment if blacks were served (1998: 168 and 182). The\nowner\u2019s actions would be wrong and would amount to a rational\nform of discrimination. Additionally, Wasserstrom argues\nthat the principle that persons ought not to be treated on the basis of\nmorally arbitrary features cannot grasp the fundamental wrong of direct\nracial discrimination, because the principle is \u201ctoo contextually\nisolated\u201d from the actual features of a society in which many\npeople have racist attitudes (1995: 161). For Wasserstrom,\nthe wrong of racial discrimination cannot be separated from the fact\nthat such discrimination manifests an attitude that the members of\ncertain races are intellectually and morally inferior to the rest of\nthe population. \n\n\nA fourth view is that direct discrimination is wrong because it fails\nto treat individuals based on their merits. Thus, Hook argues that\nhiring decisions based on race, sex, religion and other social\ncategories are wrong because such decisions should be based on who\n\u201cis best qualified for the post\u201d (1995: 146). In a similar\nvein, Goldman argues that discriminatory practices are wrong because\n\u201cthe most competent individuals have prima facie rights to\npositions\u201d (1979: 34).\n\n\nOpponents of this merit-based view note that it is often highly\ncontestable who the \u201cbest qualified\u201d really is, because\nthe criteria determining qualifications are typically vague and do not\ncome with weights attached to them (Wasserman 1998: 807).\nAdditionally, Cavanagh suggests that \u201chiring on merit has more\nto do with efficiency than fairness\u201d (2002: 20). Cavanagh also\nnotes that a merit principle cannot explain what is distinctively\nwrong about an employer who discriminates against blacks because the\nemployer thinks that they are morally or intellectually inferior. The\nmerit approach \u201cmakes [the employer\u2019s] behavior look the\nsame as any other way of treating people \u2026\nnon-meritocratically\u201d (2002: 24\u201325).\n\n\nA fifth view, defended by Arneson and Lippert-Rasmussen, explains the\nwrongfulness of discrimination in terms of a certain consequentialist\nmoral theory.  The theory rests on the principle that every action\nought to maximize overall moral value and incorporates the idea that\nbenefits accruing to persons who are at a lower level of well-being\ncount more toward overall moral value than benefits to those at a\nhigher level.  Additionally, the view holds that benefits to persons\nwho are more deserving of them count more than benefits to those who\nare less deserving (Arneson 1999: 239\u201340 and Lippert-Rasmussen\n2014: 165\u201383).  This approach holds that discrimination is wrong\nbecause it violates a rule that would be part of the social morality\nthat maximizes overall moral value.  Thus, Arneson writes that his\nview \u201ccan possibly defend nondiscrimination and equal\nopportunity norms as part of the best consequentialist public\nmorality\u201d (2013: 99).  However, for many thinkers, the view will\nfail to adequately capture a key aspect of discrimination, viz., that\ndiscrimination is not simply wrong but that it is a wrong to the\npersons who are discriminated against.  One might argue in\ndefense of Arneson that those who are victimized by discrimination can\nclaim that they deserve the opportunity that is denied them, but\nphilosophers like Cavanagh, who object to the merit approach, will\nhave the same objections to such a defense (Cavanagh 2002: 20 and\n24\u201325).\n \n\nA sixth view, developed by Moreau, regards direct discrimination as\nwrong because it violates the equal entitlement each person has to\nfreedom. In particular, she contends that \u201cthe interest that is\ninjured by discrimination is our interest in \u2026\ndeliberative freedoms: that is, freedoms to have our decisions\nabout how to live insulated from the effects of normatively extraneous\nfeatures of us, such as our skin color or gender\u201d (2010:\n147). Normatively extraneous features are \u201ctraits that we\nbelieve persons should not have to factor into their deliberations\n\u2026as costs.\u201d For example,\n\u201cpeople should not be constrained by the social costs of being\none race rather than another when they deliberate about such questions\nas what job to take or where to live\u201d (2010:\n149).\n\n\nYet, it is unclear that Moreau\u2019s account gets to the bottom of\nwhat is wrong with discrimination. One might object, following the\ncriticisms leveled by Wasserstrom and Cavanagh at the arbitrariness\nand merit accounts, respectively, that the idea of a normatively\nextraneous feature is too abstract to capture what makes racial\ndiscrimination a paradigmatic form of direct discrimination.  There\nare reasons that justify our belief \u201cthat persons should not\nhave to factor [race] into their deliberations \u2026as\ncosts,\u201d and those reasons seem to be connected to the idea\nthat racial discrimination treats persons of a certain race as having\na diminished or degraded moral status as compared to individuals\nbelonging to other races. The wrong of racial and other forms of\ndiscrimination seems better illuminated by understanding it in terms\nof such degraded status than in terms of the idea of normatively\nextraneous features.\n\n\nA seventh view, developed by Hellman, holds that \u201cdiscrimination\nis wrong because it is demeaning\u201d (2018: 99). On her account, an\nact that is demeaning in the relevant way is one that \u201cexpresses\nthat a person or group is of lower [moral] status\u201d and is\nperformed by an agent who has \u201csufficient social power for the\nexpression to have force\u201d (2018: 102). For example, it is\ndemeaning, she argues, for an employer to require female employees to\nwear cosmetics because such a requirement \u201cconveys the idea that\na woman\u2019s body is for adornment and enjoyment by others\u201d\n(2008: 42). Shin proposes a similar account in his discussion of equal\nprotection, arguing that \u201cto characterize an action as unequal\ntreatment is to register a certain objection as to what, in view of\nits rationale, the action expresses\u201d (2009: 170). Offending\nactions are ones that treat a person \u201cas though that individual\nbelonged to some class of individuals that was less entitled to right\ntreatment than anyone else\u201d (2009:169).  And this seventh view\nof what makes discrimination wrongful is reflected in the legal\ncase Obergefell v. Hodges, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court\nand declaring unconstitutional laws prohibiting same-sex marriage.  In\nhis opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy wrote that \u201cthe\nnecessary consequence [of such laws] is to put the imprimatur of the\nState itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those\nwhose own liberty is then denied. Under the Constitution, same-sex\ncouples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex\ncouples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their\npersonhood to deny them this right\u201d (2015: Slip Opinion at\n19).\n\n\nClosely related to Hellman\u2019s account is an eighth view, holding\nthat direct discrimination is wrong on account of its connection to\nprejudice, where prejudice is understood as an attitude that regards\nthe members of a salient group, qua members, as not entitled\nto as much respect or concern as the members of other salient\ngroups. Prejudice can involve feelings of hostility, antipathy, or\nindifference, as well as a belief in the inferior morals, intellect,\nor skills of the targeted group. Returning to the case of the Roma who\nwere excluded by the policy of a bar, we could say that the policy was\ndiscriminatory because it was the expression of prejudice against the\nRoma, whereas a bar\u2019s policy of excluding men from the\nwomen\u2019s restroom would fail to be discriminatory because it\nwould not be an expression of prejudice.\n\n\nEly defends a version of this eighth view, holding that discriminatory\nacts are those that are motivated by prejudice (1980:\n153\u2013159). Dworkin has formulated an alternative version, arguing\nthat discriminatory acts are those that could be\njustified only if some prejudiced belief were correct.\nThe absence of a \u201cprejudice-free justification\u201d thus makes\na law or policy discriminatory (1985: 66).\n\nThe eighth view, along with the accounts of Hellman and Shin, rest on\nthe intuitively attractive idea that the wrongfulness of direct\ndiscrimination is tied to its denial of the equal moral status of\npersons.  The idea is at the center of Eidelson\u2019s account, which\nholds that \u201cacts of discrimination are intrinsically wrong when\nand because they manifest a failure to show the discriminatees the\nrespect that is due them as persons\u201d (2015: 7).  Eidelson then\ndisaggregates two dimensions of personhood: all persons are 1)\n\u201cof [intrinsic] value and equally so\u201d and 2)\n\u201cautonomous agents\u201d (2015: 79), shaping their own lives\nthrough their choices.  Discrimination can violate either or both of\nthese dimensions, leading Eidelson to describe his account as a\n\u201cpluralistic view\u201d (2015: 19; cf. Beeghly on \u201chybrid\u201d\ntheories, 2018: 95). Thus, a physician who refuses to treat would-be\npatients due to their race fails to recognize and appropriately\nrespond to their equal intrinsic value, and a fire department that\nautomatically rejects women who apply to be fire fighters violates the\nwomen\u2019s autonomy by failing to make reasonable efforts to\ndetermine whether they have endeavored to develop the requisite\nphysical strength.\n\nEidelson\u2019s account explicitly dispenses with the social salience\nrequirement, instead requiring only that the discriminator be\nresponding to some perceived difference of whatever kind between the\nvictim and other people.  However, it is not clear that this approach\ncan draw a viable line between wrongful acts of discrimination, on the\none hand, and wrongful acts not helpfully characterized as\n\u201cdiscrimination,\u201d on the other. Murderers fail to respect\nthe personhood of their victims, and most murders involve some\nperception of difference between the victim and others. But murders\nare typically regarded as acts of discrimination only when they are\n\u201chate crimes\u201d connected to the victim\u2019s membership\nin some salient social group. So Eidelson\u2019s account seems\noverinclusive. Yet, Eidelson can reply that any account that\nincorporates the social salience requirement will be underinclusive,\nbecause it will fail to count as discrimination the actions of an\nemployer who hires workers on the basis of hair color in a society\nwhere hair color is not socially salient (2018: 28\u201330).\n\nAt this point, we should step back and ask: Why do we need the\n(moralized) idea of discrimination in the first place? What is the\nvalue of having it?  For Eidelson, its value seems to reside in\npicking out certain wrongs, quite apart from any connection those\nwrongs might, or might not, have to socially systemic injustices.  But\nwe have concepts for murder and other wrongs against personhood, and,\nif we abstract from socially systemic considerations, the fact that\nthe wrongs involve distinguishing among persons does not appear to\ncarry much moral significance in typical cases.  If I steal from you\nrather than your neighbor because you have taken fewer precautions\nagainst theft, then I have wrongfully shown disrespect for your\nautonomy, but my having discriminated between you and your neighbor\nseems beside the point, morally speaking. \n\nFor defenders of the social salience requirement, the value of the\nidea of discrimination is that it can be used to pick out and\nhighlight injustices that track socially salient categories.  And a\nstrong reason for having a concept that captures such injustices is\nthat they are the among the most widespread and serious over the\ncourse of history (see section 6 below).  From this perspective,\nEidelson\u2019s hypothetical case of the idiosyncratic employer who\ndiscriminates on the basis of hair color should not dictate how the\ncore of the moralized concept of discrimination is constructed or\nconstrued but rather should be regarded as peripheral to the central\nreason for having a concept of discrimination.  Additionally, as we\nwill see in the next section, this perspective casts light on why the\nidea of indirect discrimination is a valuable part of our moral\nthinking.\n",
