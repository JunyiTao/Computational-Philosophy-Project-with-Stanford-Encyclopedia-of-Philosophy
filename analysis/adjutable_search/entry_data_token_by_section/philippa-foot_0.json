    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPhilippa Foot was born Philippa Ruth Bosanquet on October 3, 1920,\nin Owston Ferry, Lincolnshire, and grew up in Kirkleatham, in North\nYorkshire, England. Her mother, Esther, was a daughter of U.S.\nPresident Grover Cleveland. Her father, William was an industrialist,\nrunning a large Yorkshire steel works. Foot studied philosophy,\npolitics, and economics at Somerville College, a women\u2019s college\nwithin the University of Oxford. Foot had no formal education as a\nchild; as she puts it, she \u201clived in the sort of milieu where\nthere was a lot of hunting, shooting, and fishing, and where girls\nsimply did not go to college\u201d (Voorhoeve 2009: 91). In her youth,\nshe was educated by governesses, from whom she claimed she did not\neven learn \u201cwhich came first, the Romans or the Greeks\u201d\n(Conradi & Lawrence 2010). Despite this poor childhood education\nFoot was able to secure a position at Oxford by way of a\ncorrespondence course on Latin and working with an Oxford entrance\ncoach.\n\nHer earliest philosophy tutor at Somerville was Donald MacKinnon, a\nphilosopher and theologian with an interest in Plotinus, Kant, and\nHegel. Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Midgley, Iris Murdoch, all of whom\nwould go on to have celebrated careers in philosophy, were also at\nSomerville at the time. All four engaged philosophically with each\nother during their Somerville years and later (Hursthouse 2012: 182).\nFoot earned a BLitt from Somerville for her research on Kant in 1942,\nand then worked in London for the remainder of the war. At the end of\nthe war, she married the military historian M.R.D. Foot (though the\nmarriage came to an end in 1960) and returned to Somerville College to\ntake a teaching position and then, in 1949, began a fellowship there.\nG.E.M. Anscombe had started a research fellowship at Somerville in\n1946. Foot credits her introduction to analytic philosophy to\nAnscombe, who introduced Foot to a style of philosophy Anscombe picked\nup from Wittgenstein.\n\nFoot resigned her fellowship at Somerville in 1969 and began a period\nof freelancing in the United States, where she held Visiting\nProfessorships at the Universities of California, at Los Angeles and\nBerkeley, Washington, Princeton, Stanford, and the City University of\nNew York. In 1976, she took up a permanent position at the University\nof California, Los Angeles, where she remained until retiring in 1991,\nthen returning to Oxford, where she completed her monograph\nNatural Goodness. Foot\u2019s last philosophical article\nappeared in 2004, and she died on her ninetieth birthday, October 3,\n2010. It is sometimes thought that Foot was a founding member of\nOxfam, but, in fact, the first records of her involvement date from\n1948, some six years after the founding of the Oxford Committee for\nFamine Relief. She remained involved with Oxfam throughout her life\n(Hursthouse 2012: 180\u2013181).\n",
