Life and Works\n\nNicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473, the youngest of four\nchildren of Nicolaus Copernicus, Sr., a well-to-do merchant who had\nmoved to Torun from Cracow, and Barbara Watzenrode, the daughter of a\nleading merchant family in Torun. The city, on the Vistula River, had\nbeen an important inland port in the Hanseatic League. However,\nfighting between the Order of the Teutonic Knights and the Prussian\nUnion in alliance with the Kingdom of Poland ended in 1466, and West\nPrussia, which included Torun, was ceded to Poland, and Torun was\ndeclared a free city of the Polish kingdom. Thus the child of a German\nfamily was a subject of the Polish crown.\n\nThe father died in 1483, and the children\u2019s maternal uncle,\nLucas Watzenrode (1447\u20131512), took them under his protection.\nWatzenrode was a very successful cleric \u2013 he was to become\nbishop of Warmia (Ermland in German) in 1489 \u2013 and he both\nfacilitated his nephew\u2019s advancement in the church and directed\nhis education. In 1491 Copernicus enrolled in the University of\nCracow. There is no record of his having obtained a degree, which was\nnot unusual at the time as he did not need a bachelor\u2019s degree\nfor his ecclesiastical career or even to study for a higher degree.\nBut the University of Cracow offered courses in mathematics,\nastronomy, and astrology (see Goddu 25\u201333 on all the university\nofferings), and Copernicus\u2019s interest was sparked, which is\nattested to by his acquisition of books in these subjects while at\n Cracow.[1]\n\nIn 1495 Watzenrode arranged Copernicus\u2019s election as canon of\nthe chapter of Frombork (Frauenberg in German) of the Cathedral\nChapter of Warmia, an administrative position just below that of\nbishop. He assumed the post two years later, and his financial\nsituation was secure for life. In the meantime, following in his\nuncle\u2019s footsteps, Copernicus went to the University of Bologna\nin 1496 to study canon law (see Goddu part 2 on what Copernicus may\nhave encountered in Italy). While at Bologna he lived with the\nastronomy professor Domenico Maria Novara and made his first\nastronomical observations. In addition, as Rosen (1971, 323) noted,\n\u201cIn establishing close contact with Novara, Copernicus met,\nperhaps for the first time in his life, a mind that dared to challenge\nthe authority of [Ptolemy] the most eminent ancient writer in his\nchosen fields of study.\u201d Copernicus also gave a lecture on\nmathematics in Rome, which may have focused on astronomy.\n\nCopernicus\u2019s studies at Bologna provided an advantage he did not\nhave at Cracow \u2013 a teacher of Greek. Humanism began to\ninfiltrate the Italian universities in the fifteenth century. As\nGrendler (510) remarked, \u201cBy the last quarter of the century,\npractically all universities had one or several humanists, many of\nthem major scholars.\u201d Antonio Cortesi Urceo, called Codro,\nbecame professor at Bologna in 1482 and added Greek several years\nlater. Copernicus may have studied with him, for Copernicus translated\ninto Latin the letters of the seventh-century Byzantine author\nTheophylactus Simocatta (MW 27\u201371) from the 1499\nedition of a collection of Greek letters produced by the Venetian\nhumanist printer Aldus Manutius. Aldus had dedicated his edition to\nUrceo. Copernicus had his translation printed in 1509, his only\npublication prior to the On the Revolutions (De\nrevolutionibus). It is important to note that Copernicus\u2019s\nacquisition of a good reading knowledge of Greek was critical for his\nstudies in astronomy because major works by Greek astronomers,\nincluding Ptolemy, had not yet been translated into Latin, the\nlanguage of the universities at the time.\n\nCopernicus left Bologna for Frombork in 1501 without having obtained\nhis degree. The chapter then approved another leave of absence for\nCopernicus to study medicine at the University of Padua. The medical\ncurriculum did not just include medicine, anatomy, and the like when\nCopernicus studied it. Siraisi (1990, 16) noted that \u201cthe\nreception in twelfth-century western Europe of Greek and Islamic\ntechnical astronomy and astrology fostered the development of medical\nastrology\u2026the actual practice of medical astrology was greatest\nin the West between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries.\u201d\nAstrology was taught in the medical schools of Italy. \u201cThe\nimportance attached to the study of the stars in medieval medical\neducation derived from a general and widely held belief that the\nheavenly bodies play an intermediary role in the creation of things\nhere below and continue to influence them throughout their existence.\nThe actual uses of astrology in medical diagnosis and treatment by\nlearned physicians were many and various. \u2018Astrological\nmedicine\u2019 is a vague and unsatisfactory term that can embrace\nany or all of the following: first, to pay attention to the supposed\neffect of astrological birth signs or signs at conception on the\nconstitution and character of one\u2019s patients; second, to vary\ntreatment according to various celestial conditions\u2026third, to\nconnect the doctrine of critical days in illness with astrological\nfeatures, usually phases of the moon; and fourth, to predict or\nexplain epidemics with reference to planetary conjunctions, the\nappearance of comets, or weather conditions\u201d (Siraisi 1981,\n141\u201342). It is true that astrology required that medical\nstudents acquire some grounding in astronomy; nevertheless, it is\nlikely that Copernicus studied astrology while at the University of\n Padua.[2]\n\nCopernicus did not receive his medical degree from Padua; the degree\nwould have taken three years, and Copernicus had only been granted a\ntwo-year leave of absence by his chapter. Instead he matriculated in\nthe University of Ferrara, from which he obtained a doctorate in canon\nlaw. But he did not return to his chapter in Frombork; rather he went\nto live with his uncle in the episcopal palace in Lidzbark-Warminski\n(Heilsberg in German). Although he made some astronomical\nobservations, he was immersed in church politics, and after his\nelderly uncle became ill in 1507, Copernicus was his attending\nphysician. Rosen (1971, 334\u201335) reasonably conjectured that the\nbishop may have hoped that his nephew would be his successor, but\nCopernicus left his uncle because his duties in Lidzbark-Warminski\ninterfered with his continuing pursuit of his studies in astronomy. He\ntook up residence in his chapter of Frombork in 1510 and stayed there\nthe rest of his life.\n\nNot that leaving his uncle and moving to Frombork exempted Copernicus\nfrom continued involvement in administrative and political duties. He\nwas responsible for the administration of various holdings, which\ninvolved heading the provisioning fund, adjudicating disputes,\nattending meetings, and keeping accounts and records. In response to\nthe problem he found with the local currency, he drafted an essay on\ncoinage (MW 176\u2013215) in which he deplored the\ndebasement of the currency and made recommendations for reform. His\nmanuscripts were consulted by the leaders of both Prussia and Poland\nin their attempts to stabilize the currency. He was a leader for West\nPrussia in the war against the Teutonic Knights, which lasted from\n1520\u20131525. He was physician for the bishop (his uncle had died\nin 1512) and members of the chapter, and he was consulting physician\nfor notables in East and West Prussia.\n\nNevertheless, Copernicus began to work on astronomy on his own.\nSometime between 1510 and 1514 he wrote an essay that has come to be\nknown as the Commentariolus (MW 75\u2013126) that\nintroduced his new cosmological idea, the heliocentric universe, and\nhe sent copies to various astronomers. He continued making\nastronomical observations whenever he could, hampered by the poor\nposition for observations in Frombork and his many pressing\nresponsibilities as canon. Nevertheless, he kept working on his\nmanuscript of On the Revolutions. He also wrote what is known\nas Letter against Werner (MW 145\u201365) in 1524,\na critique of Johann Werner\u2019s \u201cLetter concerning the\nMotion of the Eighth Sphere\u201d (De motu octavae sphaerae\ntractatus primus). Copernicus claimed that Werner erred in his\ncalculation of time and his belief that before Ptolemy the movement of\nthe fixed stars was uniform, but Copernicus\u2019s letter did not\nrefer to his cosmological ideas.\n\nIn 1539 a young mathematician named Georg Joachim Rheticus\n(1514\u20131574) from the University of Wittenberg came to study with\nCopernicus. Rheticus brought Copernicus books in mathematics, in part\nto show Copernicus the quality of printing that was available in the\nGerman-speaking cities. He published an introduction to\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas, the Narratio prima (First Report).\nMost importantly, he convinced Copernicus to publish On the\nRevolutions. Rheticus oversaw most of the printing of the book,\nand on 24 May 1543 Copernicus held a copy of the finished work on his\ndeathbed.\n2. Astronomical Ideas and Writings\n2.1 Pre-Copernican Astronomy\n\nClassical astronomy followed principles established by Aristotle.\nAristotle accepted the idea that there were four physical elements\n\u2013 earth, water, air, and fire. He put the earth in the center of\nthe universe and contended that these elements were below the moon,\nwhich was the closest celestial body. There were seven planets, or\nwandering stars, because they had a course through the zodiac in\naddition to traveling around the earth: the moon, Mercury, Venus, the\nsun, Mars, Jupiter. Beyond that were the fixed stars. The physical\nelements, according to Aristotle moved vertically, depending on their\n\u2018heaviness\u2019 or \u2018gravity\u2019; the celestial bodies\nwere not physical but a \u2018fifth element\u2019 or\n\u2018quintessence\u2019 whose nature was to move in perfect circles\naround the earth, making a daily rotation. Aristotle envisioned the\nearth as the true center of all the circles or \u2018orbs\u2019\ncarrying the heavenly bodies around it and all motion as\n\u2018uniform,\u2019 that is, unchanging.\n\nBut observers realized that the heavenly bodies did not move as\nAristotle postulated. The earth was not the true center of the orbits\nand the motion was not uniform. The most obvious problem was that the\nouter planets seemed to stop, move backwards in\n\u2018retrograde\u2019 motion for a while, and then continue\nforwards. By the second century, when Ptolemy compiled his\nAlmagest (this common name of Ptolemy\u2019s\nSyntaxis was derived from its Arabic title), astronomers had\ndeveloped the concept that the orbit moves in \u2018epicycles\u2019\naround a \u2018deferrent,\u2019 that is, they move like a flat\nheliacal coil around a circle around the earth. The earth was also\noff-center, on an \u2018eccentric,\u2019 as the heavenly bodies\nmoved around a central point. Ptolemy added a point on a straight line\nopposite the eccentric, which is called the \u2018equalizing\npoint\u2019 or the \u2018equant,\u2019 and around this point the\nheavenly bodies moved uniformly. Moreover, unlike the Aristotelian\nmodel, Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest did not describe a unified\nuniverse. The ancient astronomers who followed Ptolemy, however, were\nnot concerned if his system did not describe the \u2018true\u2019\nmotions of the heavenly bodies; their concern was to \u2018save the\nphenomena,\u2019 that is, give a close approximation of where the\nheavenly bodies would be at a given point in time. And in an age\nwithout professional astronomers, let alone the telescope, Ptolemy did\na good job plotting the courses of the heavenly bodies.\n\nNot all Greek astronomical ideas followed this geocentric system.\nPythagoreans suggested that the earth moved around a central fire (not\nthe sun). Archimedes wrote that Aristarchus of Samos actually proposed\nthat the earth rotated daily and revolved around the\n sun.[3]\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, the Islamic world was the center of\nastronomical thought and activity. During the ninth century several\naspects of Ptolemy\u2019s solar theory were recalculated. Ibn\nal-Haytham in the tenth-eleventh century wrote a scathing critique of\nPtolemy\u2019s work: \u201cPtolemy assumed an arrangement that\ncannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his\nimagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him\nfrom the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the\nexisting motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement\nthat is impossible to exist\u201d (quoted in Rosen 1984, 174).\nSwerdlow and Neugebauer (46\u201348) stressed that the\nthirteenth-century Maragha school was also important in finding errors\nand correcting Ptolemy: \u201cThe method of the Maragha planetary\nmodels was to break up the equant motion in Ptolemy\u2019s models\ninto two or more components of uniform circular motion, physically the\nuniform rotation of spheres, that together control the direction and\ndistance of the center of the epicycle, so that it comes to lie in\nnearly the same position it would have in Ptolemy\u2019s model, and\nalways moves uniformly with respect to the equant.\u201d They found\nthat Copernicus used devices that had been developed by the Maragha\nastronomers Nasir al-Din Tusi (1201\u20131274), Muayyad al-Din\nal-Urdi (d. 1266), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236\u20131311), and Ibn\nal-Shatir (1304\u20131375). In addition, Ragep, 2005, has shown that\na theory for the inner planets presented by Regiomontanus that enabled\nCopernicus to convert the planets to eccentric models had been\ndeveloped by the fifteenth-century, Samarqand-trained astronomer ali\nQushji\n (1403\u20131474).[4]\n\nRenaissance humanism did not necessarily promote natural philosophy,\nbut its emphasis on mastery of classical languages and texts had the\nside effect of promoting the sciences. Georg Peurbach\n(1423\u20131461) and (Johannes M\u00fcller) Regiomontanus\n(1436\u20131476) studied Greek for the purpose of producing an\noutline of Ptolemaic astronomy. By the time Regiomontanus finished the\nwork in 1463, it was an important commentary on the Almagest\nas well, pointing out, for example, that Ptolemy\u2019s lunar theory\ndid not accord with observations. He noted that Ptolemy showed the\nmoon to be at various times twice as far from the earth as at other\ntimes, which should make the moon appear twice as big. At the time,\nmoreover, there was active debate over Ptolemy\u2019s deviations from\nAristotle\u2019s requirement of uniform circular motion.\n2.2 The Commentariolus\n\nIt is impossible to date when Copernicus first began to espouse the\nheliocentric theory. Had he done so during his lecture in Rome, such a\nradical theory would have occasioned comment, but there was none, so\nit is likely that he adopted this theory after 1500. Further,\nCorvinus, who helped him print his Latin translation in 1508\u201309,\nexpressed admiration for his knowledge of astronomy, so that\nCopernicus\u2019s concept may have still been traditional at this\npoint. His first heliocentric writing was his Commentariolus.\nIt was a small manuscript that was circulated but never printed. We do\nnot know when he wrote this, but a professor in Cracow cataloged his\nbooks in 1514 and made reference to a \u201cmanuscript of six leaves\nexpounding the theory of an author who asserts that the earth moves\nwhile the sun stands still\u201d (Rosen, 1971, 343; MW 75).\nThus, Copernicus probably adopted the heliocentric theory sometime\nbetween 1508 and 1514. Rosen (1971, 345) suggested that\nCopernicus\u2019s \u201cinterest in determining planetary positions\nin 1512\u20131514 may reasonably be linked with his decisions to\nleave his uncle\u2019s episcopal palace in 1510 and to build his own\noutdoor observatory in 1513.\u201d In other words, it was the result\nof a period of intense concentration on cosmology that was facilitated\nby his leaving his uncle and the attendant focus on church politics\nand medicine.\n\nIt is impossible to know exactly why Copernicus began to espouse the\nheliocentric cosmology. Despite his importance in the history of\nphilosophy, there is a paucity of primary sources on Copernicus. His\nonly astronomical writings were the Commentariolus, the\nLetter against Werner, and On the Revolutions; he\npublished his translation of Theophylactus\u2019s letters and wrote\nthe various versions of his treatise on coinage; other writings relate\nto diocesan business, as do most of the few letters that survive.\nSadly, the biography by Rheticus, which should have provided scholars\nwith an enormous amount of information, has been lost. Therefore, many\nof the answers to the most interesting questions about\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas and works have been the result of conjecture\nand inference, and we can only guess why Copernicus adopted the\nheliocentric system.\n\nMost scholars believe that the reason Copernicus rejected Ptolemaic\ncosmology was because of Ptolemy\u2019s\n equant.[5]\n They assume this because of what Copernicus wrote in the\nCommentariolus:\n\nYet the widespread [planetary theories], advanced by Ptolemy and most\nother [astronomers], although consistent with the numerical [data],\nseemed likewise to present no small difficulty. For these theories\nwere not adequate unless they also conceived certain equalizing\ncircles, which made the planet appear to move at all times with\nuniform velocity neither on its deferent sphere nor about its own\n[epicycle\u2019s] center\u2026Therefore, having become aware of\nthese [defects], I often considered whether there could perhaps be\nfound a more reasonable arrangement of circles, from which every\napparent irregularity would be derived while everything in itself\nwould move uniformly, as is required by the rule of perfect motion.\n(MW 81).\n\n\nGoddu (381\u201384) has plausibly maintained that while the initial\nmotivation for Copernicus was dissatisfaction with the equant, that\ndissatisfaction may have impelled him to observe other violations of\nuniform circular motion, and those observations, not the rejection of\nthe equant by itself, led to the heliocentric theory. Blumenberg (254)\nhas pointed out that the mobility of the earth may have been\nreinforced by the similarity of its spherical shape to those of the\nheavenly bodies.\n\nAs the rejection of the equant suggests a return to the Aristotelian\ndemand for true uniform circular motion of the heavenly bodies, it is\nunlikely that Copernicus adopted the heliocentric model because\nphilosophies popular among Renaissance humanists like Neoplatonism and\nHermetism compelled him in that\n direction.[6]\n Nor should we attribute Copernicus\u2019s desire for uniform\ncircular motions to an aesthetic need, for this idea was philosophical\nnot aesthetic, and Copernicus\u2019s replacing the equant with\nepicyclets made his system more complex than Ptolemy\u2019s. Most\nimportantly, we should bear in mind what Swerdlow and Neugebauer (59)\nasserted:\n\nCopernicus arrived at the heliocentric theory by a careful analysis of\nplanetary models \u2013 and as far as is known, he was the only\nperson of his age to do so \u2013 and if he chose to adopt it, he did\nso on the basis of an equally careful analysis.\n\n\nIn the Commentariolus Copernicus listed assumptions that he\nbelieved solved the problems of ancient astronomy. Bardi has suggested\nthat these assumptions are non-Euclidean axioms. Copernicus stated\nthat the earth is only the center of gravity and center of the\nmoon\u2019s orbit; that all the spheres encircle the sun, which is\nclose to the center of the universe; that the universe is much larger\nthan previously assumed, and the earth\u2019s distance to the sun is\na small fraction of the size of the universe; that the apparent motion\nof the heavens and the sun is created by the motion of the earth; and\nthat the apparent retrograde motion of the planets is created by the\nearth\u2019s motion. Although the Copernican model maintained\nepicycles moving along the deferrent, which explained retrograde\nmotion in the Ptolemaic model, Copernicus correctly explained that the\nretrograde motion of the planets was only apparent not real, and its\nappearance was due to the fact that the observers were not at rest in\nthe center. The work dealt very briefly with the order of the planets\n(Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the only planets\nthat could be observed with the naked eye), the triple motion of the\nearth (the daily rotation, the annual revolution of its center, and\nthe annual revolution of its inclination) that causes the sun to seem\nto be in motion, the motions of the equinoxes, the revolution of the\nmoon around the earth, and the revolution of the five planets around\nthe sun.\n2.3 On the Revolutions\n\nThe Commentariolus was only intended as an introduction to\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas, and he wrote \u201cthe mathematical\ndemonstrations intended for my larger work should be omitted for\nbrevity\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d (MW 82). In a sense it\nwas an announcement of the greater work that Copernicus had begun. The\nCommentariolus was never published during Copernicus\u2019s\nlifetime, but he sent manuscript copies to various astronomers and\nphilosophers. He received some discouragement because the heliocentric\nsystem seemed to disagree with the Bible, but mostly he was\nencouraged. Although Copernicus\u2019s involvement with official\nattempts to reform the calendar was limited to a no longer extant\nletter, that endeavor made a new, serious astronomical theory welcome.\nFear of the reaction of ecclesiastical authorities was probably the\nleast of the reasons why he delayed publishing his\n book.[7]\n The most important reasons for the delay was that the larger work\nrequired both astronomical observations and intricate mathematical\nproofs. His administrative duties certainly interfered with both the\nresearch and the writing. He was unable to make the regular\nobservations that he needed and Frombork, which was often fogged in,\nwas not a good place for those observations. Moreover, as Gingerich\n(1993, 37) pointed out,\n\n[Copernicus] was far from the major international centers of printing\nthat could profitably handle a book as large and technical as De\nrevolutionibus. On the other [hand], his manuscript was still\nfull of numerical inconsistencies, and he knew very well that he had\nnot taken complete advantage of the opportunities that the\nheliocentric viewpoint offered\u2026Furthermore, Copernicus was far\nfrom academic centers, thereby lacking the stimulation of technically\ntrained colleagues with whom he could discuss his work.\n\n\nThe manuscript of On the Revolutions was basically complete\nwhen Rheticus came to visit him in 1539. The work comprised six books.\nThe first book, the best known, discussed what came to be known as the\nCopernican theory and what is Copernicus\u2019s most important\ncontribution to astronomy, the heliocentric universe (although in\nCopernicus\u2019s model, the sun is not truly in the center). Book 1\nset out the order of the heavenly bodies about the sun: \u201c[The\nsphere of the fixed stars] is followed by the first of the planets,\nSaturn, which completes its circuit in 30 years. After Saturn, Jupiter\naccomplishes its revolution in 12 years. The Mars revolves in 2 years.\nThe annual revolution takes the series\u2019 fourth place, which\ncontains the earth\u2026together with the lunar sphere as an\nepicycle. In the fifth place Venus returns in 9 months. Lastly, the\nsixth place is held by Mercury, which revolves in a period of 80\ndays\u201d (Revolutions, 21\u201322). This established a\nrelationship between the order of the planets and their periods, and\nit made a unified system. This may be the most important argument in\nfavor of the heliocentric model as Copernicus described\n it.[8]\n It was far superior to Ptolemy\u2019s model, which had the planets\nrevolving around the earth so that the sun, Mercury, and Venus all had\nthe same annual revolution. In book 1 Copernicus also insisted that\nthe movements of all bodies must be circular and uniform, and noted\nthat the reason they may appear nonuniform to us is \u201ceither that\ntheir circles have poles different [from the earth\u2019s] or that\nthe earth is not at the center of the circles on which they\nrevolve\u201d (Revolutions, 11). Particularly notable for\nCopernicus was that in Ptolemy\u2019s model the sun, the moon, and\nthe five planets seemed ironically to have different motions from the\nother heavenly bodies and it made more sense for the small earth to\nmove than the immense heavens. But the fact that Copernicus turned the\nearth into a planet did not cause him to reject Aristotelian physics,\nfor he maintained that \u201cland and water together press upon a\nsingle center of gravity; that the earth has no other center of\nmagnitude; that, since earth is heavier, its gaps are filled with\nwater\u2026\u201d (Revolutions, 10). As Aristotle had\nasserted, the earth was the center toward which the physical elements\ngravitate. This was a problem for Copernicus\u2019s model, because if\nthe earth was no longer the center, why should elements gravitate\ntoward it?\n\nThe second book of On the Revolutions elaborated the concepts\nin the first book; book 3 dealt with the precession of the equinoxes\nand solar theory; book 4 dealt with the moon\u2019s motions; book 5\ndealt with the planetary longitude and book 6 with\n latitude.[9]\n Copernicus depended very much on Ptolemy\u2019s observations, and\nthere was little new in his mathematics. He was most successful in his\nwork on planetary longitude, which, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (77)\ncommented, was \u201cCopernicus\u2019s most admirable, and most\ndemanding, accomplishment\u2026It was above all the decision to\nderive new elements for the planets that delayed for nearly half a\nlifetime Copernicus\u2019s continuation of his work \u2013 nearly\ntwenty years devoted to observation and then several more to the most\ntedious kind of computation \u2013 and the result was recognized by\nhis contemporaries as the equal of Ptolemy\u2019s accomplishment,\nwhich was surely the highest praise for an astronomer.\u201d\nSurprisingly, given that the elimination of the equant was so\nimportant in the Commentariolus, Copernicus did not mention\nit in book 1, but he sought to replace it with an epicyclet throughout\nOn the Revolutions. Nevertheless, he did write in book 5 when\ndescribing the motion of Mercury:\n\n\u2026the ancients allowed the epicycle to move uniformly only\naround the equant\u2019s center. This procedure was in gross conflict\nwith the true center [of the epicycle\u2019s motion], its relative\n[distances], and the prior centers of both [other\ncircles]\u2026However, in order that this last planet too may be\nrescued from the affronts and pretenses of its detractors, and that\nits uniform motion, no less than that of the other aforementioned\nplanets, may be revealed in relation to the earth\u2019s motion, I\nshall attribute to it too, [as the circle mounted] on its eccentric,\nan eccentric instead of the epicycle accepted in antiquity\n(Revolutions, 278\u201379).\n\n2.4 Rheticus and the Narratio prima\n\nAlthough Copernicus received encouragement to publish his book from\nhis close friend, the bishop of Chelmo Tiedemann Giese\n(1480\u20131550), and from the cardinal of Capua Nicholas\nSch\u00f6nberg (1472\u20131537), it was the arrival of Georg Joachim\nRheticus in Frombork that solved his needs for a supportive and\nstimulating colleague in mathematics and astronomy and for access to\nan appropriate printer. Rheticus was a professor of mathematics at the\nUniversity of Wittenberg, a major center for the student of\nmathematics as well as for Lutheran theology. In 1538 Rheticus took a\nleave of absence to visit several famous scholars in the fields of\nastronomy and mathematics. It is not known how Rheticus learned about\nCopernicus\u2019s theory; he may have been convinced to visit\nCopernicus by one of the earlier scholars he had visited, Johann\nSch\u00f6ner, though, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (16) noted, by\n\u201cthe early 1530\u2019s knowledge of Copernicus\u2019s new\ntheory was circulating in Europe, even reaching the high and learned\ncircles of the Vatican.\u201d Rheticus brought with him some\nmathematical and astronomical volumes, which both provided Copernicus\nwith some important material and showed him the quality of the\nmathematical printing available in the German centers of\n publishing.[10]\n Rheticus\u2019s present of the 1533 edition of Regiomontanus\u2019s\nOn all Kinds of Triangles (De triangulis omnimodis),\nfor example, convinced Copernicus to revise his section on\ntrigonometry. But Rheticus was particularly interested in showing\nCopernicus the work of the Nuremberg publisher Johann Petreius as a\npossible publisher of Copernicus\u2019s volume. Swerdlow and\nNeugebauer (25) plausibly suggested that \u201cPetreius was offering\nto publish Copernicus\u2019s work, if not advertising by this notice\nthat he was already committed to do so.\u201d Rheticus wrote the\nNarratio prima in 1540, an introduction to the theories of\nCopernicus, which was published and circulated. This further\nencouraged Copernicus to publish his Revolutions, which he\nhad been working on since he published the\nCommentariolus.\n\nThe Narratio prima was written in 1539 and took the form of a\nletter to Johann Sch\u00f6ner announcing Copernicus\u2019s findings\nand describing the contents of the Revolutions. He dealt with\nsuch topics as the motions of the fixed stars, the tropical year, the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, the problems resulting from the motion of\nthe sun, the motions of the earth and the other planets, librations,\nlongitude in the other five planets, and the apparent deviation of the\nplanets from the ecliptic. He asserted that the heliocentric universe\nshould have been adopted because it better accounted for such\nphenomena as the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the\nobliquity of the ecliptic; it resulted in a diminution of the\neccentricity of the sun; the sun was the center of the deferents of\nthe planets; it allowed the circles in the universe to revolve\nuniformly and regularly; it satisfied appearances more readily with\nfewer explanations necessary; it united all the spheres into one\nsystem. Rheticus added astrological predictions and number mysticism,\nwhich were absent from Copernicus\u2019s work.\n\nThe Narratio prima was printed in 1540 in Gdansk (then\nDanzig); thus, it was the first printed description of the Copernican\nthesis. Rheticus sent a copy to Achilles Pirmin Gasser of Feldkirch,\nhis hometown in modern-day Austria, and Gasser wrote a foreword that\nwas published with a second edition that was produced in 1541 in\nBasel. It was published again in 1596 as an appendix to the first\nedition of Johannes Kepler\u2019s Mysterium cosmographicum\n(Secret of the Universe), the first completely Copernican work by an\nadherent since the publications by Copernicus and Rheticus.\n2.5 Printing On the Revolutions and Osiander\u2019s Preface\n\nThe publication of Rheticus\u2019s Narratio prima did not\ncreate a big stir against the heliocentric thesis, and so Copernicus\ndecided to publish On the Revolutions. He added a dedication\nto Pope Paul III (r. 1534\u20131549), probably for political reasons,\nin which he expressed his hesitancy about publishing the work and the\nreasons he finally decided to publish it. He gave credit to\nSch\u00f6nberg and Giese for encouraging him to publish and omitted\nmention of Rheticus, but it would have been insulting to the pope\nduring the tense period of the Reformation to give credit to a\nProtestant\n minister.[11]\n He dismissed critics who might have claimed that it was against the\nBible by giving the example of the fourth-century Christian apologist\nLactantius, who had rejected the spherical shape of the earth, and by\nasserting, \u201cAstronomy is written for astronomers\u201d\n(Revolutions,\n 5).[12]\n In other words, theologians should not meddle with it. He pointed to\nthe difficulty of calendar reform because the motions of the heavenly\nbodies were inadequately known. And he called attention to the fact\nthat \u201cif the motions of the other planets are correlated with\nthe orbiting of the earth, and are computed for the revolution of each\nplanet, not only do their phenomena follow therefrom but also the\norder and size of all the planets and spheres, and heaven itself is so\nlinked together that in no portion of it can anything be shifted\nwithout disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a\nwhole\u201d (Revolutions, 5).\n\nRheticus returned to Wittenberg in 1541 and the following year\nreceived another leave of absence, at which time he took the\nmanuscript of the Revolutions to Petreius for publishing in\nNuremberg. Rheticus oversaw the printing of most of the text. However,\nRheticus was forced to leave Nuremberg later that year because he was\nappointed professor of mathematics at the University of Leipzig. He\nleft the rest of the management of printing the Revolutions\nto Andrew Osiander (1498\u20131552), a Lutheran minister who was also\ninterested in mathematics and astronomy. Though he saw the project\nthrough, Osiander appended an anonymous preface to the work. In it he\nclaimed that Copernicus was offering a hypothesis, not a true account\nof the working of the heavens: \u201cSince he [the astronomer] cannot\nin any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever\nsuppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly from the\nprinciples of geometry for the future as well as for the past\n\u2026these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable\u201d\n(Revolutions, xvi). This clearly contradicted the body of the\nwork. Both Rheticus and Giese protested, and Rheticus crossed it out\nin his copy.\n2.6 Sixteenth Century Reactions to On the Revolutions\n\nCopernicus\u2019s fame and book made its way across Europe over the\nnext fifty years, and a second edition was brought out in\n 1566.[13]\n As Gingerich\u2019s census of the extant copies showed, the book was\nread and commented on by astronomers (for a fuller discussion of\nreactions, see Omodeo). Gingerich (2004, 55) noted \u201cthe majority\nof sixteenth-century astronomers thought eliminating the equant was\nCopernicus\u2019 big achievement.\u201d\n\nWhile Martin Luther may have made negative comments about Copernicus\nbecause the idea of the heliocentric universe seemed to contradict the\n Bible,[14]\n Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), who presided over the\ncurriculum at the University of Wittenberg, eventually accepted the\nimportance of teaching Copernicus\u2019s ideas, perhaps because\nOsiander\u2019s preface made the work more palatable. His son-in-law\nCaspar Peucer (1525\u20131602) taught astronomy there and began\nteaching Copernicus\u2019s work. As a result, the University of\nWittenberg became a center where Copernicus\u2019s work was studied.\nBut Rheticus was the only Wittenberg scholar who accepted the\nheliocentric idea. Robert Westman (1975a, 166\u201367; 2011, chap. 5)\nsuggested that there was a \u2018Wittenberg Interpretation\u2019:\nastronomers appreciated and adopted some of Copernicus\u2019s\nmathematical models but rejected his cosmology, and some were pleased\nwith his replacement of the equant by epicyclets. One of these was\nErasmus Reinhold (1511\u20131553), a leading astronomer at Wittenberg\nwho became dean and rector. He produced a new set of planetary tables\nfrom Copernicus\u2019s work, the Prutenic Tables. Although, as\nGingerich (1993, 232) pointed out, \u201cthere was relatively little\nto distinguish between the accuracy of the Alfonsine Tables\nand the Prutenic Tables,\u201d the latter were more widely\nadopted; Gingerich plausibly suggested that the fact that the Prutenic\nTables more accurately predicted a conjunction between Jupiter and\nSaturn in 1563 made the difference. Reinhold did not accept the\nheliocentric theory, but he admired the elimination of the equant. The\nPrutenic Tables excited interest in Copernicus\u2019s work.\n\nTycho Brahe (1546\u20131601) was the greatest astronomical observer\nbefore the invention of the telescope. He called Copernicus a\n\u2018second Ptolemy\u2019 (quoted in Westman 1975, 307) and\nappreciated both the elimination of the equant and the creation of a\nplanetary system. But Tycho could not adopt the Copernican system,\npartly for the religious reason that it went against what the Bible\nseemed to preach. He, therefore, adopted a compromise, the\n\u2018geoheliostatic\u2019 system in which the two inner planets\nrevolved around the sun and that system along with the rest of the\nplanets revolved around the earth.\n\nAmong Catholics, Christoph Clavius (1537\u20131612) was the leading\nastronomer in the sixteenth century. A Jesuit himself, he incorporated\nastronomy into the Jesuit curriculum and was the principal scholar\nbehind the creation of the Gregorian calendar. Like the Wittenberg\nastronomers, Clavius adopted Copernican mathematical models when he\nfelt them superior, but he believed that Ptolemy\u2019s cosmology\n\u2013 both his ordering of the planets and his use of the equant\n\u2013 was correct.\n\nPope Clement VII (r. 1523\u20131534) had reacted favorably to a talk\nabout Copernicus\u2019s theories, rewarding the speaker with a rare\nmanuscript. There is no indication of how Pope Paul III, to whom\nOn the Revolutions was dedicated reacted; however, a trusted\nadvisor, Bartolomeo Spina of Pisa (1474\u20131546) intended to\ncondemn it but fell ill and died before his plan was carried out (see\nRosen, 1975). Thus, in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on\nthe Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When\nGiordano Bruno (1548\u20131600) was burned at the stake as a heretic,\nit had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican\ncosmology, and this is clearly shown in Finocchiaro\u2019s\nreconstruction of the accusations against Bruno (see also\nBlumenberg\u2019s part 3, chapter 5, titled \u201cNot a Martyr for\nCopernicanism: Giordano Bruno\u201d).\n\nMichael Maestlin (1550\u20131631) of the University of T\u00fcbingen\nwas the earliest astronomer after Rheticus to adopt Copernicus\u2019s\nheliocentricism. Although he wrote a popular textbook that was\ngeocentric, he taught his students that the heliocentric system was\nsuperior. He also rejected Osiander\u2019s preface. Maestlin\u2019s\npupil Johannes Kepler wrote the first book since the publication of\nOn the Revolutions that was openly heliocentric in its\norientation, the Mysterium cosmographicum (Secret of the\nUniverse). And, of course, Kepler eventually built on\nCopernicus\u2019s work to create a much more accurate description of\nthe solar system.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A. <em>Complete Works</em> of Copernicus", "B.
