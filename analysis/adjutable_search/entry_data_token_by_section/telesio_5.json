    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\n\nThe ethics exposed in the 9th book of De rerum\nnatura is strictly naturalist. The only objective which Telesio\nascribes to the spirit is self-preservation and self-improvement, the\nformer lying in its ability to react suitably to influences from the\nexternal world, the latter in its capability of finding means to\nimprove its state of being. This comes about through theoretical\nknowledge, specifically through natural philosophy and medicine (cf.\nDRN book VIII, ch. XXI) and through learning to control one\u2019s own\nemotions and desires. According to Telesio, we can voluntarily provoke\nand suppress affections and their related actions (DRN book IX, ch. I;\nvol. III, p. 332f.); what is more, we are able to master the degree to\nwhich we desire and are affected (DRN book IX, ch. II; vol. III, p.\n334). The principle of moral virtue is said to be a knowledge of what\nis helpful and what is damaging for survival and well-being in human\nsociety. All virtues and vices are reduced to self-conservation.\n",
