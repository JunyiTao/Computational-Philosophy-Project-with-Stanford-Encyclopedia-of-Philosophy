    "main_text": "Algorithms\n3. Algorithms\n\nEven though known and widely used since antiquity, the problem of\ndefining what algorithms are is still open (Vardi 2012). The word\n\u201calgorithm\u201d originates from the name of the\nninth-century Persian mathematician Ab\u016b Ja\u02bffar\nMu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, who\nprovided rules for arithmetic operations using Arabic numerals.\nIndeed, the rules one follows to compute basic arithmetic operations\nsuch as multiplication or division, are everyday examples of\nalgorithms. Other well-known examples include rules to bisect an angle\nusing compass and straightedge, or Euclid\u2019s algorithm for\ncalculating the greatest common divisor. Intuitively, an algorithm is\na set of instructions allowing the fulfillment of a given task.\nDespite this ancient tradition in mathematics, only modern logical and\nphilosophical reflection put forward the task of providing a\ndefinition of what an algorithm is, in connection with the\nfoundational crisis of mathematics of the early twentieth century (see\nthe entry on the\n philosophy of mathematics).\n The notion of effective calculability arose from logical\nresearch, providing some formal counterpart to the intuitive notion of\nalgorithm and giving birth to the theory of computation. Since then,\ndifferent definitions of algorithms have been proposed,\nranging\u00a0from formal to non-formal approaches, as sketched in the\nnext sections.\n",
