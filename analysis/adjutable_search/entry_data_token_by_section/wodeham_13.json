    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy || The Continuum\n6.1 The Continuum\n\nAdam Wodeham, like many of his English contemporaries in the first\ndecades of the fourteenth century, was embroiled in the debate over\ndivisibilism and indivisibilism (atomism). Following William of\nOckham, Adam Wodeham was a divisibilist who argued in his\nTractatus de indivisibilibus against philosophical atomism\n(indivisibilism). Wodeham cites extensively from the writings of\ndivisibilists and indivisibilists, such that his Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus is a rich source for tracing the history of this\nlong and complex debate (Wood 1988, 14).\n\nAristotle, in the sixth book of the Physics, develops several\narguments against the idea that continua are composed of\natoms or indivisibles. The majority of medieval philosophers accepted\nAristotle\u2019s position, but by the end of the thirteenth century\nthere developed a minority opinion that supported indivisibilism. The\nmost famous proponents of indivisibilism were Robert Grosseteste (d.\n1253), Henry Harclay (d. 1317), Walter Chatton (d. 1343), Gerard Odon\n(d. 1349), William Crathorn (fl. 1330s) and Nicholas Bonet (d. 1360).\nThe divisibilists/indivisibilist debate in the fourteenth century was\nconcerned with the philosophical status of space and time.\nSpacial-temporal reality, according to the traditional Aristotelian\nview, was infinitely divisible. Thus, authors like Thomas Bradwardine\nand Adam Wodeham follow Aristotle and Averroes in defending the view\nthat the continuum is composed of divisible parts without\nend, and not of atoms. This view (divisibilism) is the one defended by\nAdam Wodeham in his magisterial Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus.\n\nIn response to the classical divisibilist position supported by\nAristotle, the indivisibilists held that there were\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d which constituted the composition of\ntemporal and spatial continua, e.g., temporal instants and\nlines respectively. Such \u201cindivisibles\u201d, in the early\n14th century, were understood to be an extended and simple\nontological unit, but not physical atoms per se. It is\nhelpful here to consider briefly an indivisibilist account, before\nturning to the divisibilism of Wodeham.\n\nHenry Harclay and Walter Chatton are two relatively well known\nmedieval philosophers who supported indivisibilism. Thinkers such as\nHarclay and Chatton argued, in response to Aristotle, for the\npossibility that a continuum is composed of indivisibles. The\nindividual components, or indivisibles, were generally held to be\nextensionless regardless of whether or not the individual thinker\nunderstood there to be an infinite (Harclay) or finite (Chatton)\nnumber of indivisibles in a given continuum. But, as is well\nknow, such indivisibilists accounts were generally so defensive in\ntheir posture\u2014arguing for the mere possibility of\nindivisibles\u2014that it is difficult to ascertain the broader\nphilosophical motivations which grounded such arguments. John Murdoch\nargues that there are perhaps two motives that can be gleamed for the\ntexts: (1) indivisibles may have been useful as a method of accounting\nfor the motion of angels; or (2) indivisibles may have been useful\nwhen addressing the inequality of infinites (Murdoch 1982,\n576\u2013577). Although, he notes that such motivations are mentioned\nonly in passing and that a broader motivation could have simply been\nthat \u201cthe analysis of Aristotle\u2019s arguments against\nindivisibilism uncovered loopholes in them\u201d (Murdoch 1982,\n577).\n\nThe Tractatus de indivisibilibus consists of five questions\nand it is instructive to consider the content briefly.\n\n In the first question, containing three articles, Wodeham\nconsiders whether or not forms, or extended continua, are\ncomposed of indivisibles. In the first article Wodeham develops twelve\narguments against the indivisibilists, anticipates responses to those\narguments, and rejects them (TI 35\u201393). In the second article,\nhe considers twelve arguments, from Henry Harclay and Walter Chatton,\nin support of the thesis that forms are composed of indivisibles (TI\n93\u2013101). And, in the third article, Wodeham responds to the\narguments of Harclay and Chatton (TI 103\u2013121). This first\narticle comprises about a third of the work, and the first article in\nparticular contains many of Wodeham\u2019s most significant\narguments.\nIn the second question, Wodeham treats the problem of whether or\nnot extended forms or objects are composed of indivisibles. In\nresponse, Wodeham (following Ockham) argues in the first article\nagainst the existence of points, lines or surfaces (TI 123\u2013139).\nAnd, as with the previous question, the second and third articles\nconsider arguments in defense of indivisibles and responses to those\narguments (TI 139\u2013163).\nThe third question entertains seven doubts relating to the\ndivisibilist position. In the first four doubts Wodeham treats\nZeno\u2019s famous paradoxes (as reported by Aristotle in his\nPhysics VI) (TI 165\u2013183), and in the last three doubts\nhe treats more contemporary arguments (TI 183\u2013211).\nThe fourth question considers whether or not a continuum\nis infinitely divisible. Thus, if a continuum can be divided,\nwhy cannot it be infinitely divided? To this question Wodeham provides\nan argument that a continuum cannot be divided (a. 1) (TI\n213\u2013225) and an argument to the contrary (a. 2) (TI\n225\u2013235).\nThe final question considers whether or not there are more parts,\nof the same proportion, in a larger continuum than in a\nsmaller one. In three articles, Wodeham considers an argument for the\nclaim that there are more respective parts in a larger\ncontinuum (a. 1) (TI 239\u2013247), objections to this\nargument (a. 2) (TI 247\u2013261), and finally replies to the\nobjections (a. 3) (TI 261\u2013273).\n\n\nIn the second doubt of question 3 (LT 171\u2013175;\n\u00b613\u201320), as noted above, Wodeham considers the argument of\nZeno (recorded in Aristotle\u2019s Physics) against those\nwho argue that motion is compatible with the divisibility of a\ncontinuum. This particular argument, familiar to all students\nof ancient philosophy, is exemplary both of Wodeham\u2019s historical\napproach to the questions posed by the continuum and his own\nmethod of argumentation. Thus, it is instructive to consider the\nargument in some detail. Wodeham records Zeno\u2019s argument as:\n\n\nIf every continuum is infinitely divisible, then every movable object\ntraversing any space will reach the middle of that [space] before the\nend, and consequently it will reach the middle of the second half\nbefore reading [the end] of the completing [part] of that half, and\nthen [it will reach] the middle of that next fourth [before] its\ncompleting [part]. Therefore if such halves are infinite proportional\n[parts], and if it does not happen that [a moveable object] traverses\ninfinitely many [parts] in a finite time, then it is impossible that\nany space be traversed in a finite time. And consequently, it is\nimpossible that anything move locally (LT 172\u2013173;\n\u00b614).\n\n\nWodeham, who is a divisibilist, offers a response to Zeno\u2019s\n\u201cparadox\u201d because it is necessary to avoid the\nreductio ad absurdum (i.e., there is no motion) posed by the\nclaim that an infinitely divisible finite space is not\ntraversable.\n\nWodeham begins by considering Averroes\u2019s argument that\nAristotle, in the Physics VI, contradicts the \u201cwords,\nnot the substance, of Zeno\u2019s discourse\u201d (LT 173;\n\u00b615). But, Wodeham does not agree with Averroes\u2019s\ninterpretation of Aristotle, and he defends Aristotle\u2019s\nargument. Wodeham argues that Aristotle recognizes that Zeno\u2019s\nargument \u201csupposes falsely\u201d that it is \u201cnot possible\nto traverse something infinite \u2026 in a finite time\u201d (LT\n173; \u00b616), although he also correctly recognizes that there is\nmore to be said in response to Zeno. Further, Wodeham argues that\nAristotle recognized that there is an equivocation with respect to the\nterm \u201cinfinite\u201d as applied to a continuum of\nspace or time: infinite can be understood with respect to\n\u201cdivision\u201d, or with respect to \u201cinfinite\nends\u201d. That is, the term infinite can refer to the infinite\ndivisibility of a given finite continuum of space or time, or\nthe term can refer to the fact that space or time extends without end\nor termination (LT 173; \u00b617). Because of this equivocation, the\nphrase \u201ca moveable object may traverse infinitely many things in\na finite time\u201d can be understood in two ways: either (1) as\nstating that a moveable object traverses infinitely many things that\nare extensively never terminated in a finite time; or (2) as stating\nthat a moveable object traverse infinitely many non-equal things (that\na given continuum is divided into) in a finite time (LT\n173\u2013175; \u00b618). In the former sense the claim is false, in\nthe latter sense it is true. And, in this way, Aristotle solves\nZeno\u2019s \u201cparadox\u201d to Wodeham\u2019s\nsatisfaction.\n\nFinally, Wodeham analyzes William of Ockham\u2019s\ninterpretation\u2014in the Expositio Physicorum (OP V, ll.\n49\u201356)\u2014of Averroes\u2019s argument that Aristotle\naddresses the words and not the substance of Zeno\u2019s argument.\nWodeham, recording Ockham\u2019s argument, implies that\nOckham\u2019s reading of Averroes is too \u201ccharitable\u201d,\nconcluding that \u201cif [Averroes] did understand [the matter] in\nthe manner expounded here, both his exposition and what he expounds\nare false\u201d (LT 175; \u00b6175).\n\nAs demonstrated by this brief example, in the Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus Adam Wodeham engages at length with the ancient\nand medieval philosophical tradition. Further, throughout the work he\nquotes extensively from William of Ockham\u2019s Exposition\nPhysicorum and his Tractatus de quantitate. Wodeham also\nconsiders in detail the arguments of Henry Harclay and Walter Chatton,\nall of which provides a useful historical record of this heated\ndebate. But, ultimately, the work remains a barrage of arguments\nagainst the indivisibilist, or atomist, position as defended in the\nearly fourteenth century.\n",
