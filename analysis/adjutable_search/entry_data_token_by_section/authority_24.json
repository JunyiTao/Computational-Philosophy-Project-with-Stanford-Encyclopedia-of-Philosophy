On the one hand, one can evaluate a democratic\ndecision in terms of the justice or efficiency of the outcome of the\ndecision. One can ask whether the legislation is just or for the common\ngood. This is the standpoint of the citizen who argues in favor of\nlegislation and against others and tries to put together a coalition of\nlike minded people to advance the legislation. On the other hand,\ndemocratic decision making can be evaluated in terms of the way in\nwhich the decision was made. Did the process of decision making treat\nall of its members fairly or with equal respect? Are the institutions\nof legislative representation and of campaign finance, among others,\nfair?\n\n\nBut why should the equality embodied in the democratic assembly trump\nother considerations of justice? The democratic conception of\nauthority requires each person to submit issues to a democratic vote.\nSo if they advocate some policy on the grounds that it conforms with\nwhat they take to be the correct principle of justice J, and\nthe majority chooses a different policy on the grounds of an\nincompatible principle L, the democratic theory says that\nthey ought to accept the policy that is grounded in L because\nonly in this way do they accord the proper equal respect to their\nfellow citizens.\n\n\nBut someone might ask, why should the principle of equal respect take\nprecedence over the principle J? They are both principles of\njustice so we need some reason for favoring the equal respect\nprinciple in general over the others.\n\n\nOne answer to this is to say that social justice demands that\nprinciples of justice be public in the sense that they involve\nprinciples that can be shown to be implemented to everyone who is\nreasonably conscientious and aware of some basic facts of political\nlife (such as disagreement, fallibility and cognitive bias). This is a\nversion of the basic maxim of justice that justice must not only be\ndone, it must be seen to be done. The thought then is that to the\nextent that there is significant disagreement about the substantive\nprinciples of justice in play when policy is being decided, a just\nsociety requires some way in which publicly to embody the equal\ntreatment of all the individuals in society. The controversial\nprinciples guiding the formulation of policy do not generally satisfy\nthis constraint of publicity. Indeed, given the controversies over\njustice, individuals will think that the policies do not accord with\ntheir favored conception of equality. The democratic process does seem\npublicly to embody the equal standing of all citizens and the equal\nworth of their interests against the background of disagreement and\nfallibility and all the facts that attend these phenomena. So the\ndemocratic process seems uniquely capable of publicly embodying the\nprinciple of the equal importance of each person and the equal\nimportance of the advancement of their interests (Christiano 2004).\n\n\nCritics of this view might still take issue with the thesis that\nsocial justice requires that principles be public and that this gives\npriority to the principles that underpin democracy over those that\nunderpin substantive policy proposals. The question must be, why is\npublicity, in the sense sketched above, so important?\n",
