    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Normative Ethics || Self-Interest and Benevolence\n2.1 Self-Interest and Benevolence\n\nTo begin, Hutcheson believed that the most important contribution of\nthe Inquiry was a rejection of the\n\u201cself-interest\u201d theories of Hobbes and Mandeville (see\nGill 2006: ch. 11). Famously, Hobbes and Mandeville placed the\nfoundation of morality on the individual self-interest of every moral\nagent. Now, Hutcheson thinks that a crass reduction of morality to\nself-interest is thoroughly untenable\u2014else we would assign moral\nproperties to \u201ca fruitful Field, or commodious Habitation\u201d\n(Inquiry, 89).\n\nHowever\u2014as Hutcheson clearly understands\u2014the reduction\nmorality to self-interest proposed by the self-interest theorists is\nclearly more sophisticated than this. To see this, consider the\nargument connecting morality and self-interest from Hobbes. Hobbes\nbegins with a psychological claim. According to Hobbes, humans are\nmotivated by their own good. (Note that this is something of an\noversimplification. Hobbes believes that individuals are motivated by\nwhatever they in fact desire\u2014but that their desires\nconstitute the nature of their good; Leviathan, VI,\nIX.) This leads them into conflict, as each person desires greater\npower to satisfy their desires, which inevitably interferes with the\ndesires of others. The result is violence, and \u201cthe life of man,\nsolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d (Leviathan,\nXIII). Notice, however, that Hobbes thinks that these tendencies in\npeople\u2014their tendencies toward self-interest and\nself-preservation, resulting in violence\u2014are not themselves\nmorally problematic. He writes: \n\n\nThe desires, and other passions of man, are in themselves no sin. No\nmore are the actions, that proceed from those passions, till they know\na law that forbids them: which till laws be made they cannot know: nor\nany law be made, till they have agreed upon the person that shall make\nit. (Leviathan, XIII) \n\n\nHobbes thus seems to think that moral normativity has an essential\nconnection to the motivations of agents. But because the motivations\nof agents are fundamentally self-directed, moral normativity cannot\nextend beyond what is in the fundamental interest of agents.\n\nHobbes, then, develops his self-interest theory by means of two\npremises. The first, psychological, premise is that human\nmotivation is essentially self-directed. The second,\nnormative, premise is that moral obligation is determined\nsimply given what agents will be motivated to do.\n\nHutcheson concentrates his attack on the first premise of this\nargument (see Bishop 1996). According to Hutcheson, we are not simply\nguided by our self-interest, but possess a form of\n\u201cdisinterested benevolence\u201d toward others. His most\nstriking example of this comes from the following thought\nexperiment:\n\n\nTo make this yet clearer, suppose that the Deity should declare to a\ngood Man that he should be suddenly annihilated, but at the Instant of\nhis Exit it should be left to his Choice whether his Friend, his\nChildren, or his Country should be made happy or miserable for the\nFuture, when he himself could have no Sense of either Pleasure or Pain\nfrom their State. Pray would he be any more indifferent about their\nState now, that he neither hoped or feared any thing to himself from\nit, than he was in any prior Period of his Life? Nay, is it not a\npretty common Opinion among us, that after our Decease we know nothing\nof what befalls those who survive us? How comes it then that we do not\nlose, at the Approach of Death, all Concern for our Families, Friends,\nor Country? Can there be any Instance given of our desiring any Thing\nonly as the Means of private Good, as violently when we know that we\nshall not enjoy this Good many Minutes, as if we expected the\nPossession of this good for many Years? (Inquiry, 228n33)\n\n\nInsofar as our self-interest is not affected by what happens after our\ndeath, at least according to Hutcheson, it seems strange to say that\nindividuals are concerned only for their self-interest. After all, we\nappear to be concerned not just with ourselves, but with, e.g., our\nchildren, friends, and compatriots. (Note also that Hutcheson uses a\nvery similar argument against Hume\u2019s reliance on the\nmotivational significance of sympathy. See System,\n48\u201349.)\n\nNow, as Hutcheson argues here, we may have a certain form of\npartial benevolence toward others. But Hutcheson also argues\nthat we in fact maintain \u201ca universal Determination to\nBenevolence in Mankind, even toward the most distant parts of the\nSpecies\u201d (Inquiry, 147; Essay, 34). He\nwrites:\n\n\nEvery one at present rejoices in the Destruction of Pirates; and yet\nlet us suppose a Band of such Villains cast upon some desolate Island,\nand that we were assur\u2019d some Fate would confine them there\nperpetually, so that they should disturb Mankind no more. Now let us\ncalmly reflect that these Persons are capable of Knowledge and\nCounsel, may be happy, and joyful\u2026[L]et us ask ourselves, when\nSelf-Love or regard to the Safety of better Men, no longer makes us\ndesire their Destruction\u2026whether we would wish them the Fate of\nCadmus\u2019s Army, by plunging their Swords in each others\nBreast\u2026or rather that they should recover the ordinary\nAffections of Men, become Kind, Compassionate, and Friendly\u2026and\nform an honest happy Society, with Marriages, and Relations dear, and\nall the Charities of Father, Son, and Brother\u2014I fancy the latter\nwould be the Wish of every Mortal. (Inquiry,\n105\u2013106)\n\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial for Hutcheson that motivations of\nself-interest should play no role in the esteem of actions as\nvirtuous. And hence According to Hutcheson, our moral sense approves\nonly actions motivated by benevolence, not self-interest:\n\n\nIf we examine all the Actions which are counted amiable any where, and\nenquire into the Grounds upon which they are approv\u2019d, we shall\nfind, that in the Opinion of the Person who approves them, they always\nappear as Benevolent, or flowing from Love of others, and a Study of\ntheir Happiness, whether the Approver be one of the Persons\nbelov\u2019d, or profited, or not; so that all those kind Affections\nwhich incline us to make others happy, and all Actions suppos\u2019d\nto flow from such Affections, appear morally Good, if while they are\nbenevolent toward some Persons, they be not pernicious to others.\n(Inquiry, 116)\n\n\nIndeed, for Hutcheson, \n\n\nthe Perfection of Virtue consists in \u2018having the universal\ncalm Benevolence, the prevalent Affection of the Mind, so as to\nlimit and counteract not only the selfish Passions, but even\nthe particular kind Affections. (Essay, 8) \n\n\nIndeed, even if a particular action is beneficent in its\neffects\u2014that is, it benefits other people to some extent or\nother\u2014Hutcheson holds that such an action cannot be esteemed as\nvirtuous if we presume that the action was motivated by\nself-interest:\n\n\nNor shall we find any thing amiable in any Action whatsoever, where\nthere is no Benevolence imagin\u2019d; nor in any Disposition, or\nCapacity, which is not suppos\u2019d applicable to, and\ndesign\u2019d for benevolent Purposes. Nay, as was before\nobserv\u2019d, the Actions which in fact are exceedingly useful,\nshall appear void of moral Beauty, if we know they proceeded from no\nkind Intentions toward others; and yet an unsuccessful Attempt of\nKindness, or of promoting publick Good, shall appear as amiable as the\nmost successful, if it flow\u2019d from as strong Benevolence.\n(Inquiry, 116)\n\n",
