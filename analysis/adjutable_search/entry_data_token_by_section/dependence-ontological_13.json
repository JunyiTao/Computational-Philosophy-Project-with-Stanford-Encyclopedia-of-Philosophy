    "main_text": "Applications and Other Related Notions || Substance\n6.4 Fundamentality\n\nIt seems plausible that at least in some cases where one entity is\nmore fundamental than another one, it is because the less\nfundamental is ontologically dependent on the more fundamental. Much\nof the recent discussion involving ontological dependence has focused\nexactly on the question of fundamentality and especially the question\nmentioned above, namely whether there is something that is entirely\nfundamental, ontologically independent\u2014is there an ontological\n\u201cbottom level\u201d? Hence, there are two senses in which a\nclearer understanding of ontological dependence may help: we can\nspecify in what sense fundamental entities are ontologically\nindependent as well as how other entities may be ontologically\ndependent on the fundamental entities, thus gaining further\nunderstanding of the supposed \u201chierarchy\u201d that terminates\nin the bottom level.\n\nThe bottom level is usually thought to be at the smaller end of the\nspectrum: the atomistic view suggests that certain subatomic\nparticles are fundamental. But this does not mean that the fundamental\nlevel must necessarily be at the bottom\u2014the fundamental end\ncould also be at the top, i.e., the universe as a whole could be\nconsidered fundamental\u2014a substance in its own right (see\nSchaffer 2010b). Each of these views is a type of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, which suggests that chains of ontological\ndependence must come to an end, at least at the dependent end. In\nother words, metaphysical foundationalism asserts that chains of\nasymmetric ontological dependence must terminate, they must be\nwell-founded. The idea is typically formulated in\nmereological terms, as the reference to atomism suggests: there is an\nasymmetric ontological dependence relation from one end of the\nmereological scale to the other. These questions also have\nimplications for the debate between pluralism and\nmonism (one form of such monism is defended in Schaffer 2010b\nand Tallant 2015 discusses the notion of ontological dependence in\nconnection to Schaffer\u2019s monism; see also Trogdon 2009 and the\nseparate entry on\n monism).\n\nHowever, there have been some speculative suggestions according to\nwhich chains of ontological dependence could go on ad\ninfinitum, and hence violate the requirement of well-foundedness\n(for discussion, see Bliss 2013, Morganti 2014, and Tahko 2014). The\nresulting view would appear to be some sort of metaphysical\ninfinitism as opposed to metaphysical foundationalism. One\nversion of such a view, if combined with the idea that the direction\nof dependence is towards the smaller, is a \u201cgunky\u201d\nontology, whereby matter is infinitely divisible \u201cgunk\u201d\nand objects or matter have no smallest parts. But as interesting as\nthese views and the discussion surrounding fundamentality are,\ndiscussing them in detail here would take us too far from our original\ntopic (for further discussion, see the separate entry on\n fundamentality).\n",
