Thus, according to such a view, the\nproper task of logic consists, ultimately, in investigating \u201cthe\nlaws of being true\u201d (Sluga 2002: 86). By doing so, logic is\ninterested in truth as such, understood objectively, and not in what\nis merely taken to be true. Now, if one admits that truth is a\nspecific abstract object (the corresponding truth value), then logic\nin the first place has to explore the features of this object and its\ninterrelations to other entities of various other kinds.\n\nA prominent adherent of this conception was Jan \u0141ukasiewicz. As\nhe paradigmatically put it:\n\n\nAll true propositions denote one and the same object, namely truth,\nand all false propositions denote one and the same object, namely\nfalsehood. I consider truth and falsehood to be singular\nobjects in the same sense as the number 2 or 4 is. \u2026\nOntologically, truth has its analogue in being, and falsehood, in\nnon-being. The objects denoted by propositions are called logical\nvalues. Truth is the positive, and falsehood is the negative\nlogical value. \u2026 Logic is the science of objects of a special\nkind, namely a science of logical values. (\u0141ukasiewicz\n1970: 90) \n\n\nThis definition may seem rather unconventional, for logic is usually\ntreated as the science of correct reasoning and valid inference. The\nlatter understanding, however, calls for further justification. This\nbecomes evident, as soon as one asks, on what grounds one\nshould qualify this or that pattern of reasoning as correct or\nincorrect.\n\nIn answering this question, one has to take into account that any\nvalid inference should be based on logical rules which, according to a\ncommonly accepted view, should at least guarantee that in a valid\ninference the conclusion(s) is (are) true if all the premises are\ntrue. Translating this demand into the Fregean terminology, it would\nmean that in the course of a correct inference the possession of the\ntruth value The True should be preserved from the\npremises to the conclusion(s). Thus, granting the realistic treatment\nof truth values adopted by Frege, the understanding of logic as the\nscience of truth values in fact provides logical rules with an\nontological justification placing the roots of logic in a certain kind\nof ideal entities (see Shramko 2014).\n\nThese entities constitute a certain uniform domain, which can be\nviewed as a subdomain of Frege\u2019s so-called \u201cthird\nrealm\u201d (the realm of the objective content of thoughts, and\ngenerally abstract objects of various kinds, see Frege 1918, cf.\nPopper 1972 and also Burge 1992: 634). Among the subdomains of this\nthird realm one finds, e.g., the collection of mathematical objects\n(numbers, classes, etc.). The set of truth values may be regarded as\nforming another such subdomain, namely the one of logical\nvalues, and logic as a branch of science rests essentially on\nthis logical domain and on exploring its features and\nregularities.\n",
