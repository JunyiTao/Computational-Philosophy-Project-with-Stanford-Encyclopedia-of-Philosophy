    "main_text": "The Surprise Test Paradox || Predictive determinism\n1.2 Predictive determinism\n\nInstead of viewing self-defeating predictions as showing how the\nteacher is refuted, some philosophers construe self-defeating\npredictions as showing how the student is refuted. The\nstudent\u2019s elimination argument embodies hypothetical predictions\nabout which day the teacher will give a test. Isn\u2019t the student\noverlooking the teacher\u2019s ability and desire to thwart those\nexpectations? Some game theorists suggest that the teacher could\ndefeat this strategy by choosing the test date at random.\n\nStudents can certainly be kept uncertain if the teacher is willing to\nbe faithfully random. She will need to prepare a quiz each day. She\nwill need to brace for the possibility that she will give too many\nquizzes or too few or have an unrepresentative distribution of\nquizzes.\n\nIf the instructor finds these costs onerous, then she may be tempted\nby an alternative: at the beginning of the week, randomly select a\nsingle day. Keep the identity of that day secret. Since the student\nwill only know that the quiz is on some day or other, pupils will not\nbe able to predict the day of the quiz.\n\nThis plan is risky. If, through the chance process, the last day\nhappens to be selected, then abiding by the outcome means giving an\nunsurprising test. For as in the original scenario, the student has\nknowledge of the teacher\u2019s announcement and awareness of past\ntestless days. So the teacher must exclude random selection of the\nlast day. The student is astute. He will replicate this reasoning that\nexcludes a test on the last day. Can the teacher abide by the random\nselection of the next to last day? Now the reasoning becomes all too\nfamiliar.\n\nAnother critique of the student\u2019s replication of the\nteacher\u2019s reasoning adapts a thought experiment from Michael\nScriven (1964). To refute predictive determinism (the thesis that all\nevents are foreseeable), Scriven conjures an agent\n\u201cPredictor\u201d who has all the data, laws, and calculating\ncapacity needed to predict the choices of others. Scriven goes on to\nimagine, \u201cAvoider\u201d, whose dominant motivation is to avoid\nprediction. Therefore, Predictor must conceal his prediction. The\ncatch is that Avoider has access to the same data, laws, and\ncalculating capacity as Predictor. Thus Avoider can duplicate\nPredictor\u2019s reasoning. Consequently, the optimal predictor\ncannot predict Avoider. Let the teacher be Avoider and the student be\nPredictor. Avoider must win. Therefore, it is possible to give a\nsurprise test.\n\nScriven\u2019s original argument assumes that Predictor and Avoider\ncan simultaneously have all the needed data, laws, and calculating\ncapacity. David Lewis and Jane Richardson object:\n\n\u2026 the amount of calculation required to let the predictor\nfinish his prediction depends on the amount of calculation done by the\navoider, and the amount required to let the avoider finish duplicating\nthe predictor\u2019s calculation depends on the amount done by the\npredictor. Scriven takes for granted that the requirement-functions\nare compatible: i.e., that there is some pair of amounts of\ncalculation available to the predictor and the avoider such that each\nhas enough to finish, given the amount the other has. (Lewis and\nRichardson 1966, 70\u201371)\n\n\nAccording to Lewis and Richardson, Scriven equivocates on \u2018Both\nPredictor and Avoider have enough time to finish their\ncalculations\u2019. Reading the sentence one way yields a truth:\nagainst any given avoider, Predictor can finish and against any given\npredictor, Avoider can finish. However, the compatibility premise\nrequires the false reading in which Predictor and Avoider can finish\nagainst each other.\n\nIdealizing the teacher and student along the lines of Avoider and\nPredictor would fail to disarm the student\u2019s elimination\nargument. We would have merely formulated a riddle that falsely\npresupposes that the two types of agent are co-possible. It would be\nlike asking \u2018If Bill is smarter than anyone else and Hillary is\nsmarter than anyone else, which of the two is the\nsmartest?\u2019.\n\nPredictive determinism states that everything is foreseeable.\nMetaphysical determinism states that there is only one way the future\ncould be given the way the past is. Simon Laplace used metaphysical\ndeterminism as a premise for predictive determinism. He reasoned that\nsince every event has a cause, a complete description of any stage of\nhistory combined with the laws of nature implies what happens at any\nother stage of the universe. Scriven was only challenging predictive\ndeterminism in his thought experiment. The next approach challenges\nmetaphysical determinism.\n",
