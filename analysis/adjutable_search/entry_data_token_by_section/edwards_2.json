    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Occasionalism, Idealism, Mental Phenomenalism, and Views on Identity\n2.2 Occasionalism, Idealism, Mental Phenomenalism, and Views on Identity\n\nEdwards' occasionalism, idealism, and mental phenomenalism provide a\nphilosophical interpretation of God's absolute sovereignty: God is the\nonly real cause and the only true substance.\n\nEdwards implicitly distinguishes between a real or true cause and a\ncause in the ordinary or \u201cvulgar\u201d sense. The latter is\n\u201cthat, after or upon the existence of which, or the existence of\nit after such a manner, the existence of another thing follows\u201d\n(\u201cThe Mind,\u201d no. 26; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 6, 350).\nVulgar causes aren't real causes, however. In the first place,\nso-called second causes are spatially or temporally distinct from\ntheir effects, and \u201cno [real] cause can produce effects in a\ntime and place on which itself is not\u201d (Original Sin,\n1758; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 3, 400). In the second, real causes\nnecessitate their effects and second causes do not. \u201cIt don't at\nall necessarily follow,\u201d for example, \u201cthat because there\nwas\u2026color, or resistance,\u2026or thought, or any other\ndependent thing at the last moment, that therefore there shall be the\nlike at the next\u201d (Original Sin, 1758; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 3, 404). Finally, if second causes were real causes\nthey would be sufficient to produce their effects. If they were\nsufficient, however, then God's activity would be redundant and it is\nnot. Unlike second causes, God's causal activity meets all three\nconditions. Since God is not in time or space, there is no temporal or\nspatial separation between his activity and its effects. Since God is\nessentially omnipotent, his will is necessarily effective; it is\nlogically impossible for him to will s and s not take place. The third\ncondition is also met. Because God is omnipotent he doesn't need the\ncooperation of other causal powers to produce his effects. And because\nsovereignty belongs to him alone he doesn't share his causal power\nwith others. God's decrees are thus fully sufficient for their\neffects. God alone, then, is the only real cause. Vulgar causes (e.g.,\nheating water) are simply the occasions upon which God produces\neffects (e.g., the water's boiling) according to \u201cmethods and\nlaws\u201d which express his customary manner of acting.\n\nIn an early paper (\u201cOf Atoms\u201d) Edwards pointed out that\nthe concept of a material substance is the concept of something\nsubsisting by itself, standing \u201cunderneath,\u201d and keeping\n\u201cup solidity and all other [physical] properties\u201d (Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 6, 215). He then argued that God alone meets these\nconditions, and concluded that if the concept of material substance\nrefers to anything, it refers to God's causal activity.\n\nEdwards also thought that \u201cnothing has existence any where\nelse\u2026but either in created or uncreated consciousness.\u201d\nIt follows that \u201cthe material universe exists only in the\nmind;\u201d \u201cthe existence of all corporeal things is only\nideas\u201d (\u201cOf Being,\u201d \u201cThe Mind,\u201d no. 51,\nand \u201cMiscellanies,\u201d no. 179; Edwards 1957, vol. 6, 204,\n368, and vol. 13, 327).\n\nEdwards' arguments for idealism are similar to (but apparently\nuninfluenced by) Berkeley's. One of the best examples occurs in\n\u201cThe Mind,\u201d no. 27. Edwards first argues that the idea of\na body can be resolved into ideas of color and resistance. Figure, for\nexample, is the termination of color or resistance. Solidity\nis resistance, while motion is \u201cthe communication of\nthis resistance from space to space.\u201d \u201cEvery knowing\nphilosopher\u201d agrees that colors exist only in minds.\n\u2018Resistance\u2019 refers either to instances in which one body\nresists another or to a power, namely, a body's disposition to resist\nother bodies. The first is a mode or property of ideas; it is ideas\nwhich are \u201cresisted\u2026move and stop, and rebound.\u201d\nFor example, our observation of a billiard ball's ricocheting from the\ncushion can be resolved into impressions of a particular configuration\nof color and figure (the billiard ball) moving closer to another (the\ncushion), touching it, and then moving away from it. The power of\nresistance is no more than a divine \u201cestablishment,\u201d\nnamely, \u201cthe constant law or method\u201d of \u201cthe actual\nexertion of God's power\u201d producing instances of resistance. So\ninstances of resistance are qualities of ideas and the\npower of resistance is a stable divine intention to act in\ncertain ways. Resistance, therefore, exists only in relation to minds.\nSince the idea of a body can be reduced to ideas of color and\nresistance, and color and resistance have only mental existence,\n\u201cthe world is\u2026an ideal one\u201d (Edwards 1957\u2013,\nvol. 6, 350\u201351).\n\nEdwards' mental phenomenalism is a natural extension of his\noccasionalism and views on substance. If God is the only real cause of\nspatio-temporal phenomena, he is the only real cause of\n\u201cthoughts\u201d or \u201cperceptions.\u201d If a substance is\nwhat \u201csubsists by itself,\u201d \u201cstands\nunderneath,\u201d and \u201ckeeps up\u201d a set of properties,\nthen a mental substance can only be what subsists by itself, stands\nunderneath, and keeps up mental properties. It follows that the\nconcept of mental substance either denotes nothing or refers to God's\ncausal activity. \u201cWhat we call spirit,\u201d then, \u201cis\nnothing but a composition and series of perceptions [mental\nevents]\u2026connected by\u2026laws\u201d (\u201cNotes on\nKnowledge and Existence\u201d; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 6, 398).\n\nMental and physical substance are thus identical with God's causal\nproduction of the mental events constituting minds and the sensible\nideas or \u201csensations\u201d which constitute bodies\n\u201caccording to\u2026methods and laws\u201d which he has\nfreely established (\u201cThe Mind,\u201d no. 13; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 6, 344). God is thus the only true substance as well\nas the only true cause.\n\nGod's sovereignty also extends to criteria of identity.\n\u201cSpecies\u201d (kinds or natures) are the ways we classify\nthings. But our classifications depend on our needs and interests, and\nthe character of the world we live in. Hence, in determining every\nfeature of the spatio-temporal world, God has determined how things\nwill be classified, that is, what counts as a \u201cspecies\u201d or\nkind. Since a thing's criteria of identity are determined by its\nnature or kind, God is their ultimate ground. In short, laws determine\nkinds and kinds determine criteria of identity. In determining laws\nGod has therefore determined criteria of identity (\u201cThe\nMind\u201d, nos. 41, 43, and 47; Edwards 1957, vol. 6, 359f, 361f.,\n366f.). (One implication is that God can so arrange things that Adam\nand his posterity count as one thing for purposes of punishment and\nreward.)\n",
