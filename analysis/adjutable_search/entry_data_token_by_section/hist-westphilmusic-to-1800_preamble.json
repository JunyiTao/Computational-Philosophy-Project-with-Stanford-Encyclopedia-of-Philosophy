    "main_text": "\n\nSince its origins in ancient Greece, the Western philosophical\ntradition has investigated the nature and value of music. This entry\nexamines the development of Western philosophy of music from Greek\nAntiquity to the end of the eighteenth century. Subsequent\ndevelopments are covered by the entry on\n history of western philosophy of music: since 1800.\n\nAesthetic concerns remain in the background of Western philosophical\nthinking on music until the early modern period. Plato and Aristotle\nare interested in music chiefly because of its educational and\npolitical implications, and medieval thinkers typically relate music\nto metaphysical speculations. This relative neglect of music as an art\nmay be surprising, but it is in line with the late emergence of\naesthetics as a branch of philosophy.\n\nToward the end of the Middle Ages, music theorists begin to pay more\nattention to the sensuous dimension of music. Subsequent shifts in\nmusical taste prompt questions regarding the origin and value of\nmusic\u2019s capacity to express and arouse the emotions.\n\nThe eighteenth century develops a system of the arts as the imitation\nof nature. This raises the issue of how music may fit into such a\nsystem. As the instrumental repertoire increases in magnitude and\nrefinement, it becomes clear that an account of music\u2019s position\namong the arts will require an explanation of pure instrumental\nmusic\u2019s meaning and value.\n\nFor book-length introductions to the history of Western philosophy of\nmusic, see: Fubini 1991; Lippman 1992; Bowman 1998; Martinelli 2012\n[2019]; Young forthcoming. Excerpts from classic works are collected\nin: Strunk 1950; Le Huray and Day 1981; Barker 1990; Lippman 1990;\nKatz and Dahlhaus 1993; Fubini 1994.\n",
