    "main_text": "The Idle Argument\n7. The Idle Argument\n\nAristotle mentions, as a corollary of the conclusion that everything\nthat happens, happens of necessity, that \u201cthere would be no need\nto deliberate or to take trouble (thinking that if we do this, this\nwill happen, but if we do not, it will not).\u201d (Aristotle, De\nInterpretatione, 18b31\u20133)\n\nThis thought was spelt out in what was known as \u201cthe Idle\nArgument\u201d (Bobzien 1998, Section 5). It went like this:\n\n\nIf it is fated that you will recover from this illness, then,\nregardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult a\ndoctor you will recover.\n\nBut also, if it is fated that you will not recover from this illness,\nthen, regardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult\na doctor you will not recover.\n\nBut either it is fated that you will recover from this illness or it\nis fated that you will not recover.\n\nTherefore it is futile to consult a doctor.\n\n\nThe thought, presumably, is that it is futile, because what you do\nwill have no effect. If so, the reply given by Chrysippus\n(c280\u2013c206 B.C.E.) to this argument seems exactly right (Bobzien\n1998, 5.2). The conclusion does not follow, because it may have been\nfated that you will recover as a result of seeing the doctor. The\ncorresponding reply would be equally apt if we substituted\n\u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cfated\u201d.\n\nSome versions of the argument omit \u201cit is fated that\u201d\n(Bobzien 1998, 189). It goes without saying that the corresponding\nversion of Chrysippus\u2019s reply would deal with those versions of\nthe argument.\n\nThis is not to say that fatalism does not pose any problem at all for\nthe rationality of deliberation. It is just to say that the Idle\nArgument does not show that it poses a problem.\n\nThe idle argument as originally presented was designed to show, not\nthat fatalism was correct or incorrect, but that it would have a\ncertain consequence. However, a generalised form of the version that\nomitted \u201cit is fated that\u201d would, if sound, seem to\nthreaten to establish something akin to fatalism: not, indeed, that we\nare powerless to do anything other than what we actually do, but that\nacting is futile. Although it seems that Chrysippus\u2019s reply\nwould show that such an argument would not in fact be sound, it is not\nat all clear where exactly it would go wrong. A detailed discussion of\nthis question can be found in Bledin 2020.\n",
