    "main_text": "\n\nThe sorites paradox originated in an ancient puzzle that appears to be\ngenerated by vague terms, viz., terms with unclear\n(\u201cblurred\u201d or \u201cfuzzy\u201d) boundaries of\napplication. \u2018Bald\u2019, \u2018heap\u2019,\n\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018old\u2019, and \u2018blue\u2019 are\nprime examples of vague terms: no clear line divides people who are\nbald from people who are not, or blue objects from green (hence not\nblue), or old people from middle-aged (hence not old). Because the\npredicate \u2018heap\u2019 has unclear boundaries, it seems that no\nsingle grain of wheat can make the difference between a number of\ngrains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,\nsince one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that two\ngrains do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. This\nreasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains of\nwheat make a heap. \n\nThe same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. Dorothy\nEdgington observes:\n\n\nThere\u2019s the \u2018ma\u00f1ana paradox\u2019: the unwelcome\ntask which needs to be done, but it\u2019s always a matter of\nindifference whether it\u2019s done today or tomorrow; the\ndieter\u2019s paradox: I don\u2019t care at all about the difference\nto my weight one chocolate will make. (1997: 296)\n\n\nThe puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modus\nponens: \n\n\n1 grain of wheat does not make a heap.\nIf 1 grain doesn\u2019t make a heap, then 2 grains\ndon\u2019t.\nIf 2 grains don\u2019t make a heap, then 3 grains\ndon\u2019t.\n\u2026\nIf 999,999 grains don\u2019t make a heap, then 1 million grains\ndon\u2019t.\n\nTherefore,\n1 million grains don\u2019t make a heap.\n\n\n\nThe argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning from\napparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can be\nrun equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that one\nmillion grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, then\none million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less one\ngrain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.\nIt follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thus\nsoritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains make\na heap and that any number of grains make a heap.\n\nWhat conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is there\nsomething wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use of\nvague predicates really lead to\n absurdity?[1]\n In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all the\ntime, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,\nmost theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,\ni.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discover\nthe defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attempts\nto solve it.\n",
