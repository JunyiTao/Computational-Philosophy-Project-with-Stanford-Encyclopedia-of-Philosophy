    "main_text": "\n\nBorn on the island of Martinique under French colonial rule, Frantz\nOmar Fanon (1925\u20131961) was one of the most important writers in\nblack Atlantic theory in an age of anti-colonial liberation struggle.\nHis work drew on a wide array of poetry, psychology, philosophy, and\npolitical theory, and its influence across the global South has been\nwide, deep, and enduring. In his lifetime, he published two key\noriginal works: Black Skin, White Masks (Peau noire,\nmasques blancs) in 1952 and The Wretched of the Earth\n(Les damn\u00e9s de la terre) in 1961. Collections of essays,\nA Dying Colonialism (L\u2019an V de la r\u00e9volution\nAlg\u00e9rienne 1959) and Toward the African\nRevolution (Pour la revolution Africaine), posthumously\npublished in 1964, round out a portrait of a radical thinker in\nmotion, moving from the Caribbean to Europe to North Africa to\nsub-Saharan Africa and transforming his thinking at each stop. The\n2015 collection of his unpublished writings, \u00c9crits sur\nl\u2019ali\u00e9nation et la libert\u00e9, will surely\nexpand our understanding of the origins and intellectual context of\nFanon\u2019s thinking.\n\nFanon engaged the fundamental issues of his day: language, affect,\nsexuality, gender, race and racism, religion, social formation, time,\nand many others. His impact was immediate upon arrival in Algeria,\nwhere in 1953 he was appointed to a position in psychiatry at\nBilda-Joinville Hospital. His participation in the Algerian\nrevolutionary struggle shifted his thinking from theorizations of\nblackness to a wider, more ambitious theory of colonialism,\nanti-colonial struggle, and visions for a postcolonial culture and\nsociety. Fanon published in academic journals and revolutionary\nnewspapers, translating his radical vision of anti-colonial struggle\nand decolonization for a variety of audiences and geographies, whether\nas a young academic in Paris, a member of the Algeria National\nLiberation Front (FLN), Ambassador to Ghana for the Algerian\nprovisional government, or revolutionary participant at conferences\nacross Africa. Following a diagnosis and short battle with leukemia,\nFanon was transported to Bethesda, Maryland (arranged by the U.S.\nCentral Intelligence Agency) for treatment and died at the National\nInstitute for Health facility on December 6, 1961.\n",
