    "main_text": "Introduction and Overview\n1. Introduction and Overview\n\n\nIt may be difficult to imagine today\u2019s world without search\nengines. Which high school student has not used a Web search engine to query\nabout some topic or subject? Of course, it is quite possible that many\nInternet users, both young and old, do not consciously distinguish\nbetween the search engines they use and Web browsers that now also\ntypically include search engines as a feature within their user\ninterface. But virtually all Internet users have come to expect and\ndepend on the instantaneous results they receive in response to their\nvarious search queries. While there is no shortage of definitions of\n\u201csearch engine,\u201d none has been accepted as the\nstandard or universally agreed upon definition. For purposes of this\nentry, however, the definition of a (Web) search engine, put forth by\nHalavais (2009, 5\u20136), is \u201can information retrieval system\nthat allows for keyword searches of distributed digital text.\u201d\nWe note that this definition includes some important technical terms\nand concepts that, in turn, need defining and further elucidation. Our\nexamination of key technical concepts underlying search engines is\nintended to provide a useful context for our analysis of the ethical\nimplications. In this sense, Blanke (2005, 34) is correct that an\nadequate analysis of the ethical aspects of search engines\n\u201crequires knowledge about the technology and its\nfunctioning.\u201d\n\n\nWe begin with a brief sketch of the history and evolution of search\nengines, from their conception in the pre-Internet era to the\ndevelopment and implementation of contemporary (\u201cWeb 2.0\u201d\nera) search engines such as Google. Our examination of important\nhistorical developments of this technology is intended to address our\nfirst question, noted above: \u201cWhat is a search engine?\u201d It\nalso provides a backdrop for analyzing our second major question,\n\u201cWhy are search engines problematic from an ethical\nperspective?\u201d where a cluster of ethical concerns involving\nsearch engine technology is examined. These include issues ranging\nfrom search engine bias and the problem of opacity/non-transparency,\nto concerns affecting privacy and surveillance, to a set of issues\ninvolving censorship and democracy. We also describe some emerging\nethical concerns affecting (cyber)security\u2014at the data, system,\nand (inter)national levels\u2014generated by the use of\n\u201cdiscoverable search engines\u201d in the context of the\nInternet of Things. Additionally, we question whether search engine\ncompanies have any special moral obligations, e.g., in light of their\n\u201cprivileged\u201d placed in society as \u201cgatekeepers of\nthe Web\u201d (Hinman, 2005, 21), for which they should be held\naccountable. In analyzing this question, we also examine a key role\nthat trust now plays for users who have come to depend on search\nengines, and the companies that develop them, for access to accurate\ninformation.\n\n\nFinally, in the concluding\nsection, we briefly mention some impacts that search engines have for\nbroader philosophical issues (especially in the area of epistemology)\nthat may not be solely or mainly ethical in nature. However, an\nadequate analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of this\nentry.\n",
