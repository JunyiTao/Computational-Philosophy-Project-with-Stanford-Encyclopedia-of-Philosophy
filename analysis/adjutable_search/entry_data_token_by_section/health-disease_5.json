    "main_text": "Naturalism || Functions\n4.3 Functions\n\nThe Boorsian analysis is of a commonsense concept of disease which\nbottoms out in a notion of malfunction as the cause of illness. The\nview is that conceptual analysis determines the empirical commitments\nof our disease concepts and then hands over to the biomedical sciences\nthe problem of finding biological functions and malfunctions. Some\nrecent theorists, notably Wakefield, have argued for an evolutionary\naccount of function as that which has historically been spread by\nnatural selection. Others have argued that the biomedical sciences\nemploy a different conception of function. Besides identifying the\nright concept of function for the job, other problems affect the whole\nnaturalist community. A reliance on scientific, functional\ndecomposition as the ultimate justification of judgments of health and\ndisease requires a revisionist, rather than a conservative, account.\nAlso, it may not always be possible to settle contested cases by an\nappeal to a notion of normal human nature, because that notion is\nitself contested.\n\nFirst, why suppose that the relevant concept of function is an\nadaptive one, and that dysfunction is a failure of a biological system\nto fulfill its adaptive function? This analysis of function is often\ntermed the etiological account, and although it is widespread in\nphilosophy of biology it seems to be conceptually tied to fitness\nrather than health (M\u00e9thot 2011). Advocates of a thoroughgoing\nevolutionary approach to medicine (such as Gluckman, Beedle and Hanson\n2009) can be read as providing a framework within which we can make\nsense of a number of processes that have an effect on health and\ndisease, but not as offering analyses of health and disease that are\ntied to fitness. Gluckman et al. (p.5) consider the difference between\nlactose intolerance, which develops after weaning and is normal for\nmost human populations, and congenital hypolactasia, a condition in\nwhich newborns cannot digest maternal milk. The former is a\nconsequence of the absence of pastoralism in most historical human\npopulations and does not affect fitness in those populations, whereas\nthe latter would have been fatal in the past and thus was selected\nagainst. However, they do not define disease in terms of\nfitness-lowering: they note rather that an evolutionary perspective\ncan make us sensitive to hitherto neglected causes of pathology and\nalso sensitive to over-hasty judgments of pathology in cases where the\ncondition is normal among populations with a given evolutionary\ntrajectory.\n\nWakefield\u2019s approach is not that of a thoroughgoing evolutionary\ntheorist of disease in that sense. Rather, he plugs an etiological\naccount of function into a Boorsian model, and his approach has been\ndeveloped with little attempt to argue that medicine does in fact use\nan evolutionary, teleological account of function. In opposition,\nSchaffner (1993) has argued that although medicine might use\nteleological talk in its attempts to develop a mechanistic picture of\nhow humans work, the teleology is just heuristic. It can be completely\ndispensed with when the mechanistic explanation of a given organ or\nprocess is complete. Schaffner argues that as we learn more about the\ncausal role a structure plays in the overall functioning of the\norganism, the need for teleological talk of any kind drops out and is\nsuperseded by the vocabulary of mechanistic explanation, and that\nevolutionary functional ascriptions are merely heuristic; they focus\nour attention on \u201centities that satisfy the secondary [i.e.\nmechanistic] sense of function and that it is important for us to know\nmore about\u201d (1993, 390).\n\nIn effect, Schaffner is arguing that the biomedical sciences employ a\ncausal, rather than a teleological, concept of function. This is in\nthe spirit of Cummins\u2019s (1975) systemic analysis of function as the\ncausal contribution a structure makes to the overall operation of the\nsystem that includes it. Cummins\u2019s concept of function is not a\nhistorical or evolutionary concept. According to Cummins, a component\nof a system may have a function even it was not designed or selected\nfor. Wakefield has tied disease conceptually to an evolutionary\nconcept of function as a naturally selected capacity. It is doubtful\nif this connection can be found in either science or common sense\nabout disease. Perhaps in some areas of biology functional ascription\nis indeed teleological. However, most theorists who have attended to\nbiomedical contexts agree with Boorse and Schaffner that the function\nof an organ or structure can be understood without thinking of it as\nan adaptation. Lange (2007) explicitly follows the systemic approach\nto function. He argues that diseases are incapacities that explain\nsymptoms in causal-analytic terms.Medical understanding requires that\nfunctional structures can be identified and analyzed in terms of their\ncontribution to the overall maintenance of the organism as a living\nsystem. However, it is also clear that the contribution of some\nsystems \u2013 especially reproductive ones \u2013 have a purpose that is not\ntied to homeostatic regulation and organisation in this way, which\ncomplicates the picture. Theorists who prefer a causal-historical\naccount to a teleogical one argue that explanation in medicine takes a\nmodel of the normal realization of a biological process and uses the\nmodel to show how abnormalities stem from the failure of normal\nrelations to apply between components of the model. This requires a\nnon-historical function concept, one that is at home in\ncausal-mechanistic, rather than evolutionary, explanation. Proponents\nof a teleogical account can respond that those systems, even if they\nadmit of mechanistic explanation, only exist in the first place\nbecause they have facilitated survival and reproduction, and that the\netiological perspective provides an overall conceptual framework. \n\nAn evolutionary approach faces problems in specifying what the overall\nevolved function of a system might be and showing how functions\ncontribute to it. First, it is very difficult to assess the relevant\nevidence that a given biological systems is \u2014 as in Wakefield\u2019s\ntreatment \u2014 the product of natural selection (Davies 2001,\nChapter 5). Since many ailments do not prevent one from living and\nhaving children, it is even harder to show that a disease is\nnecessarily the product of a malfunction that lowers fitness or\n\u2014 as in Boorse \u2014 interferes with survival and\nreproduction. Another problem for Wakefield is that if you regard\nevolutionary dysfunction as partly constitutive of disease then if an\nillness depends on structures that have no evolved function, it cannot\nreally be an illness. A biological structure might be a spandrel or a\nby-product, or have some other non-selective history. Such a structure\ncannot malfunction in Wakefield\u2019s sense, and so it cannot be diseased\nin the primary, evolutionary sense.The idea would have to be weakened\nto suggest that it is diseased in a derivative sense in virtue of its\nimplications for other selected effects elsewhere in the system \n\nObjections to an evolutionary notion of medical malfunction do not\nshow that there is anything wrong with the general idea of basing\njudgments of health and disease on a scientifically established\npicture of the normal functional decomposition of human beings.\nHowever, on this account, it becomes harder to retain the conservative\nproject that looks for the natural phenomena that fall under, and are\ntherefore constrained by, our folk concepts of health and disease.\nWakefield, for instance, thinks some psychiatric diagnoses flout our\nintuitions by attributing disorder on the basis of behavior alone\nwithout looking for malfunctioning mental mechanisms (1997a). He\nappeals to intuitions to derive necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the folk concept of mental disorder, and assumes that science\nshould search for the psychological processes that fit the concept\nthus defined. But it is one thing to take intuitions as a starting\npoint, and another to say that they are hegemonic. Boorse, too,\nadduces everyday linguistic usage and commonsense intuitions as\nevidence, even though he claims to be discussing the clinical concepts\nof health and disease. \n\nA revisionist can say that a condition we currently disvalue but do\nnot regard as a disease may turn out to involve malfunction and hence\nto be a disease, whatever our intuitions say. Conversely, we may think\nsomething is a disease but we might be wrong, just as we were wrong\nabout drapetomania or masturbation, which do not causally depend on\nany biological malfunction. Conservatives resist this possibility.\nWakefield claims that we have intuitions about human nature that make\nit \u201cobvious from surface features\u201d whether underlying\nmechanisms are functional or dysfunctional (Wakefield 1997b, 256). But\nit is an empirical discovery whether one\u2019s physiology or psychology is\nfunctioning properly, not something to be decided from the armchair,\nor even from inspecting surface features. A conservative may, though,\nseek to distinguish debunked intuitions that can be explained away\n(perhaps as products of local norms, as in the masturbation case) from\nmore resilient intuitions that survive debunking and can still feature\nas constraint on analysis. \n\nHowever, once we hand over the task of uncovering malfunction to the\nsciences we can no longer make common sense the ultimate arbiter,\nunless we wish to explicitly import, into the concept of disease,\nconsiderations derived from folk theories of what normal human nature\namounts to.\n\nIt seems that the analysis of disease as depending on malfunctioning\nbiological components requires a functional decomposition of human\nbiology. If that decomposition is to be independent of what we think\npeople should be like, it should not be regulated by common sense\ntheories of human nature, but discovered by science. We must be able\nto ascertain, within acceptable limits of variation, the biological\nstandards that nature has imposed on humans. The goal of finding out\nhow a biological system works is fixed by our interests in health and\nwell-being, but the naturalist\u2019s assumption is that the goal is met by\ndiscovering empirical facts about human biology, not our own,\nculturally defined, norms. So, we diagnose someone as suffering from\nmesenteric adenitis not just because they are in discomfort due to\nfever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, but because the lower right\nquadrant of the mesenteric lymphatic system displays abnormal\ninflammation. This thickening of the nodes is not just the objective\ncause of the discomfort, it is an objective failure of the lymphatic\nsystem to make its normal contribution to the overall system. For the\nnaturalist\u2019s program to work, the biological roles of human organs\nmust be natural facts just as empirically discoverable as the atomic\nweights of chemical elements. That may result in the overturning of\ncommon sense.\n\nThis raises a further issue. It is widely believed that function\nconcepts are intrinsically normative, since they are teleological (for\na recent review see Barnes 2016). Therefore, the objection continues,\nclaims about natural functional and malfunction introduce normative\nconsiderations into the foundations of medicine, which are supposed to\nbe purely scientific.\n\nA response might be to maintain that whether or not functional claims\nshould be seen as normative, it is not the socially relative\nnormativity appealed to by constructivists. The crucial point is that\nin the life sciences, some biological system can fail to behave as a\ntheory predicts without impugning the prediction: we can say that the\nsystem is malfunctioning. This contrasts with other sciences, in\nwhich, if a system fails to behave as predicted, the fault lies with\nthe science, not the system.\n\nGriffiths and Matthewson (2018) attempt to rehabilitate an\nevolutionary account of function in this context. They tie a selected\neffects interpretation of function to life history theory, with the\nadvertised aim of providing an explication of pathology that grounds\nit in a mature science rather than trying to recover some commonsense,\nor even medically prevalent, concept of disease. Their key contention\nis that this gives them a scientifically sound way to make\ndiscrimination that would otherwise be puzzling, such as the\ndistinction between disease states and senescence, and the means to\nsort populations into principled reference classes. The resulting\npicture (Matthewson and Griffiths 2017) is one which generates a\nvariety of evolution-based ways in which organisms can \"go wrong\".\nThis sets up a taxonomy of opportunities for intervention: some\norganisms are malfunctioning; others are working properly but in the\nwrong environment; others are badly off because the environment is\ninhospitable even though it is normal for them and they are working as\nthey have evolved to; still others generate a development pathway\nbased on misleading information about what optimal development will\nrequire. This way of setting up the issues is strongly revisionist,\nand arguably is no longer an attempt to define disease at all as most\nof the scholars we have discussed would understand it. Matthewson and\nGriffiths argue for the congruence of this account with our best\nscience and its stress on the continuity of human and non-human\nbiology.\n\nSupporters of an evolutionary account of function advertise the ease\nwith which an account of malfunction follows from the theory as one of\nits virtues. Their idea is that we can say when a system is\nmalfunctioning by observing that it is not carrying out the job which\nnatural selection designed it to perform. In contrast, it is widely\nbelieved that systemic accounts of function cannot deal with\nmalfunction at all. The argument goes like this: what a system is\ntaken to do is relative to our explanatory interests, and that a\nputative malfunction can just be understood as a contribution to a\ndifferent property of the system. Davies (2001) argues that the first\nof these claims can be defeated by restricting functional ascriptions\nto hierarchically organized systems in which lower level capacities\nrealize upper level ones. That gives us a characterization of function\nindependent of our explanatory interests.\n\nGodfrey-Smith (1993) argues that systemic concepts of function do\npermit attributions of malfunction. He argues that a token component\nin a system is malfunctioning when it cannot play the role that lets\nother tokens of the same type feature in the explanation of the larger\nsystem. Davies (2003, 212) denies this. He says that functional types\nare defined in terms of what they can do and that if a component\ncannot carry out its normal contribution to the overall system then it\nceases to be a member of a type. However, Davies\u2019 objection appears to\nfail, at least in medical contexts, if we can identify components\napart from their functional roles. Suppose we can identify biological\ncomponents in terms of their anatomical position and relationships to\nother organs. If so, we can say that an organ in the position\ncharacteristic of its type remains a member of that type even though\nit has lost some capacity characteristic of that type, and hence is\nmalfunctioning. Reasoning like this permits doctors to identify organs\nas normal or abnormal during autopsies, even though every system in a\ncorpse no longer possesses its normal function in Davies\u2019s sense.\n\nThis leaves unaddressed the issue of how we determine what normal\nfunction is. Wachbroit (1994) argues that when we say that an organ is\nnormal, we employ a biomedical concept of normality that is an\nidealized description of a component of a biological system in an\nunperturbed state that may never be attained in actual systems. Boorse\n(1977, 1997) insists that the notion of normality in biomedical\nconcepts is statistical \u2014 how things usually are in a reference\nclass, but this view faces the problem of specifying the reference\nclasses in an informative way. But given the amount of variation\nwithin a species, it will always be hard to find reference classes\nwhich share a design. As Ereshefsky (2009) puts it, Boorse assumes\nthat statistical normality coincides with the kind of normality that\nmedicine cares about, but this looks wrong. Wachbroit (1994, 588)\nargues convincingly that the role of normality in physiology is like\nthe role that pure states or ideal entities play in physical\ntheories.\n",
