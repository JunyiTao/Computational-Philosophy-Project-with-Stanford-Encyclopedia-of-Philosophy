    "main_text": "Classical-Liberal Feminism || Self-Ownership and Women\u2019s Rights\n2.1 Self-Ownership and Women\u2019s Rights\n\nClassical liberalism holds that women and men are self-owners capable\nof acquiring property rights over things. As such women and men,\nequally, have the right to freedom from coercive interference with\ntheir person and property. This right to freedom from coercive\ninterference consists in, at least, rights to freedom of conscience\nand expression, freedom to control what happens to one\u2019s body,\nfreedom of association, freedom to acquire, control and transfer\nproperty, freedom of contract, as well as the right to compensation\nwhen rights are violated. The state\u2019s role is, exclusively, to\nprotect citizens from coercive interference by protecting their\nrights. Some reject even a limited state, however, holding that\nnongovernmental means of protecting rights are to be preferred.\n\nClassical-liberal feminists hold that the right to freedom from\ncoercive interference has powerful implications for women\u2019s\nlives. It implies that women have the right to freedom in intimate,\nsexual and reproductive matters. This includes sexual autonomy (the\nright to engage in sexual activity of one\u2019s choosing including\nthe buying and selling of sex (Almodovar 2002; Lehrman 1997: 23), and\nthe right to defend oneself against sexual aggression, including the\nuse of firearms (Stevens, Teufel, & Biscan 2002)); freedom of\nexpression (the right to appear in, publish, and consume pornography\nfree of censorship (McElroy 1995; Strossen 2000)); freedom of intimate\nassociation (the right to partner or enter into a private marriage\ncontract (McElroy 1991a: 20)); and reproductive freedom (the right to\nuse birth control, have an abortion (on the minority of pro-life\nlibertarians see Tabarrok 2002: 157), and buy and sell bodily\nreproductive services, for example as in surrogate motherhood (Lehrman\n1997: 22; McElroy 2002c; Paul 2002)). Freedom from interference with\nperson and property also means that women have the right to engage in\neconomic activity, entering contracts, and acquiring, controlling and\ntransferring property free of sexist state limits (Epstein 2002; Kirp,\nYudof, & Franks 1986: 204).\n\nOne way to characterize the wrong involved when states fail to\nrecognize these rights of women is as a failure to respect\nwomen\u2019s right to be treated as men\u2019s equal, or the right\nto equal treatment under the law. To be sure, classical-liberal\nfeminists hold that the law should not treat women and men\ndifferently. But this is because they believe everyone has the same\nrights, not because they believe women have a right to be treated the\nsame as men. This is clear when we note that, for classical-liberal\nfeminism, equal treatment under unjust law is not justice (McElroy\n1991a: 3).\n\nSame treatment under the law does not guarantee same outcomes.\nClassical-liberal feminists hold that women\u2019s rights are not\nviolated when citizens exercise their rights in ways that create\nunequal outcomes (Epstein 2002: 30). A woman\u2019s rights are\nviolated only when she is interfered with coercively, that is, when\nthere is, or is a threat of, forced loss of freedom, property or life\n(which does not serve as just restraint or compensation).\n",
