    "main_text": "Why-questions\n3. Why-questions\n\nFor whether-questions (indeed, for all elementary questions in the\nview of some), the question-answer relationship can be defined in\npurely formal terms. One approach to why-questions is to try to make\nthe question-answer relationship formal in that case, too, or at least\nas formal as possible. The main proponent of this approach is\nBromberger (1966), whose account is also the first influential account\nof why-questions. Van Fraassen (1980) takes an opposite view,\ntheorizing that the question-answer relationship is almost purely\npragmatic. Skow (2016) proposes a theory that is neither formal nor\npragmatic but is instead metaphysical, claiming that answers to\nlower-level why-questions always identify causes or grounds. We\nconsider all three theories in some detail below.\n",
