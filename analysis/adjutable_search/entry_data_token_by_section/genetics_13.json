The\nanti-miscegenation laws promoted by eugenicists were explicitly\ndesigned to prevent White people from breeding with Black people.\nBlack people were not the only targets though. Eugenicists also spoke\nof the \u201cIrish race\u201d, the \u201cItalian race\u201d, and\nthe \u201cSlavic race\u201d. These racial categories were just as\nreal for the eugenicists as the categories of Black, White, and Asian,\nand anti-immigration laws were passed to keep undesirable races away\n(entry:\n race).\n\nThe simplistic ideas about race held by eugenicists did not hold up to\nscientific scrutiny. Twentieth century developments in fields like\nhuman evolution, anthropology, and sociology proved that races were\nnot so cleanly distinguishable\u2014that there were no racial atomic\nnumbers that carved up Black and White in the same way that proton\nnumber neatly distinguished gold from mercury. Still, interest in race\nand genetics persisted. Insights from the study of human evolution\nrevealed how the earliest humans moved out of Africa roughly 70,000\nyears ago in a series of migrations, some moving east across the Asian\ncontinent, some moving north up into what is now Europe, some\neventually crossing the Bering Strait and entering the Americas. As\nthese human populations moved about, they encountered very different\nenvironments with unique selection pressures (Herrera and\nGarcia-Bertrand 2018). What counted as adaptive in the fjords of\nNorthern Europe looked quite different from what was adaptive in the\ndeserts of Northern Africa, and so the human populations over time\nadapted to the distinct environments\u2014some developing darker skin\nwhile others grew lighter, some developing a resistance to cholera\nwhile others developed a resistance to malaria.\n\nThe revised conceptions of race and genetics worked off this\nevolutionary story, where the idea was that racial categories\nrepresented human groups with unique genetic profiles tied to those\ndifferent selection histories (Hardimon 2017). A Black person, the\nthought went, came from African ancestry, while a White person came\nfrom European ancestry. In turn, the Black person was likely to have a\ndifferent genetic profile when it came to melanin production (which\ncontrols skin shade) than the White person, and the Black person was\nmore likely to be a carrier for sickle-cell anemia (a blood disorder\nthat also offers some resistance to malaria) while the White person\nwas more likely to be a carrier for cystic fibrosis (a respiratory\ndisorder that also offers some resistance to cholera) (Spencer 2018).\nProponents of these newer ideas about race and genetics were eager to\nsay that they were not in the business of ranking races; they were\njust tracing different racial histories and the modern phenotypic\nresults of them (entry:\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n\nEven the revised understanding of race and genetics, however, faced\nchallenges. First, the groupings from human evolution did not map\nneatly onto the traditional folk concepts of race; for example, if\n\u201cWhite\u201d applied to people descended from the migration\nthat ultimately wound up in Northern Europe, then that would mean\nchildren born today in Bangalore, Oslo, and Damascus all count as\n\u201cWhite\u201d\u2014a counterintuitive grouping of\n\u201cWhite\u201d people (Smith 2011). Critics also pointed out that\nthe folk concepts of race evolved over time, largely in response to\npolitical and economic pressures (like census counting and justifying\nslavery), not biological insights (like paleogenetic discoveries)\n(Roberts 2011). Some critics have encouraged distinguishing\n\u201crace\u201d from \u201cancestry\u201d, confining talk of\ngenetics (e.g., genetic ancestral testing, genetic medicine) to the\nancestry side of that distinction and keeping it out of discussions of\nrace (Yudell et al. 2016; entries:\n identity politics;\n philosophy of biology in Latin America).\n",
