    "main_text": "The epistemic function of conscience || Conscience as a faculty for direct moral knowledge\n3.2 Conscience as a faculty for direct moral knowledge\n\nContrary to what Montaigne and Hobbes had claimed, Rousseau argued in\nEmile, or Education that good education can free conscience\nfrom the corrupting influences of societies. Actually, one of the aims\nof education is to render the young autonomous moral thinkers and\nagents by teaching them how to critically examine and, if necessary,\nreplace received norms (Rousseau 1762; see Sorabji 2014, for a\ndiscussion). The idea here is that conscience is what remains of our\ninnate moral sense once we free it from \u201cchildish errors\u201d\nand \u201cprejudices of our upbringing\u201d (Rousseau 1921 [1762]:\n253). As Rousseau presents it,\n\nThere is therefore at the bottom of our hearts an innate principle of\njustice and virtue, by which, in spite of our maxims, we judge our own\nactions or those of others to be good or evil; and it is this\nprinciple that I call conscience. (Rousseau 1921 [1762]: 253)\n\n\nAccording to Rousseau, then, conscience has a natural tendency to\nperceive and follow the right order of nature, and a good teacher\nshould help the young\u2019s conscience to do what it is naturally\npredisposed to do. In Rousseau\u2019s words:\n\nToo often does reason deceive us; we have only too good a right to\ndoubt her; but conscience never deceives us; she is the true guide of\nman; it is to the soul what instinct is to the body; he who obeys his\nconscience is following nature and he need not fear that he will go\nastray\u2026 Let us obey the call of nature; we shall see that her\nyoke is easy and that when we give heed to her voice we find a joy in\nthe answer of a good conscience. (Rousseau 1921 [1762]: 252)\n\n\nThis understanding of conscience as a deeper form of moral knowledge\nbrings us to the second sense in which conscience can be said to have\nan epistemic role. As well as merely witnessing received opinions or\ndivine laws, conscience can also be conceived as a moral sense giving\nus direct access to moral principles. Understood in this way,\nconscience is typically seen as intuitive and influenced by emotions,\nrather than a reason-based faculty. In particular, 18th\nCentury sentimentalist philosophers often (e.g., Shaftesbury (1711)\nand Hume (1738\u20131740)) identified conscience with a moral\n\u201csentiment\u201d or moral \u201csense\u201d. According to\nHume\u2019s psychological theory, for instance, \u201creason is\nwholly inactive and can never be the source of so active a principle\nas conscience, or a sense of morals\u201d (Hume 1738\u20131740: book\n3, part 1, section 1). Also on more recent accounts of conscience and\nof private morality, the dictates of conscience can be understood as\nexpressions of our moral intuitions. According to Thagard and Finn\n(2011), for instance, \u201cconscience is a kind of moral\nintuition\u201d (p. 168) that is \u201cboth cognitive and\nemotional\u201d(p.156).\n\nOnce again, there are reasons to doubt the epistemic and moral\nauthority of conscience so understood. A lot of work in recent moral\npsychology aimed at understanding moral disagreement has suggested\nthat there are seemingly irreconcilable differences in fundamental\nmoral intuitions and emotions among people with different worldviews\n(e.g., Haidt 2012; Greene 2013). These differences in fundamental\nmoral intuitions seem to undermine the epistemic status of conscience\nand, with it, conscience\u2019s moral authority, not least because\nmost of our moral intuitions seem, according to these recent\ndevelopments in moral psychology, not to be amenable to revision in\nlight of new evidence or new good reasons. Reasoning, on any plausible\naccount, should be an important part of morality; however, what our\nconscience tells us may have little to do with reasons and evidence.\nTheoretical work in moral psychology (e.g., Haidt 2012; Graham et al.\n2009; Haidt 2001), supported by evidence from neuroscience (Greene\n2013), suggests that our most fundamental moral beliefs might be based\non intuitions and emotions over which our rational capacities have\nlittle control. If this account is correct, then we have reasons to be\nskeptical about the possibility of affecting, let alone changing,\npeople\u2019s conscientious beliefs through dialogue, public\ndiscussion and reason giving. Psychological research has focused\nparticularly on the differences between liberal and conservative\nthinking. For example, it has been suggested that conservative moral\nand political views are often founded on certain specific emotions,\ne.g., disgust or fears, and specific intuitions, e.g., intuitive\nopposition to perceived violations of purity and to authority\nsubversion, whereas liberal views are often driven by other specific\nemotions, e.g., anger, and intuitions, e.g., intuitive rejection of\nfairness violations or liberty infringements (Haidt 2001 and 2012). If\nconscience simply is the expression of moral intuition, and if\nindividuals have significantly different and irreconcilable moral\nintuitions, then individuals also have significantly different and\ndifficult-to-reconcile conscientious moral consciences.\n",
