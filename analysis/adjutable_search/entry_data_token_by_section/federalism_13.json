    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Democratic Theory\n4.6 Democratic Theory\n\nFederalism may increase citizens\u2019 control over matters important\nto them but also raises several challenges to democratic theory,\nespecially as developed for unitary states. Federal arrangements are\noften more complex, thereby challenging standards of transparency,\naccountability and public deliberation (Habermas 2001). The restricted\npolitical agendas of each center of authority also require defense\n(Dahl 1983; Braybrooke 1983). One of several sets of issues concern\nthe standing of member units. Challenging puzzles concern federal\norders where some or all units are not internally democratic (for\nfurther issues, cf., Norman 2006, 144\u2013150).\n\nThe power that member units wield in federations often restricts or\nviolates majority rule, in ways that merit careful scrutiny.\nDemocratic theory has long been concerned with how to prevent\ndomination of minorities, and many federal political orders do so by\ngranting member units some influence over common decisions. Federal\npolitical orders typically influence individuals\u2019 political\ninfluence by skewing their voting weight in favor of citizens of small\nmember units, or by granting member unit representatives veto rights\non central decisions. Minorities thus exercise control in apparent\nviolation of principles of political equality and\none-person-one-vote\u2014more so when member units are of different\nsize. These features raises fundamental normative questions concerning\nwhy member units should matter for the allocation of political power\namong individuals who live in different member units. Some of these\npuzzles are addressed in terms of \u2018demoicracy\u2019, especially\nregarding the European Union (van Parijs 1997, Nicolaidis 2012,\nSch\u00fctze 2020). Thus theorists disagree about whether every EU\nmember state should maintain sovereignty in the sense of enjoying a\nveto for all decisions (Bellamy 2019, Cheneval et al 2015).\n",
