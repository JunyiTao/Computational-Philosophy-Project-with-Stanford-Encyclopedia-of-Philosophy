Preliminaries\n\n\nThe setting for the discussion is a general relativistic\nspacetime\n \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) where\n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is a differentiable manifold and\n\\(g_{ab}\\) is a Lorentz signature metric defined on all\nof \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The central issue addressed in the\nphysics literature on time machines is whether in this general setting\nit is physically possible to operate a Thornian time machine. This\nissue is to be settled by proving theorems about the solutions to the\nequations that represent what are taken to be physical laws operating\nin the general relativistic setting\u2014or at least this is so once\nthe notion of a Thornian time machine has been explicated.\nUnfortunately, no adequate and generally accepted explication that\nlends itself to the required mathematical proofs is to be found in the\nliterature. This is neither surprising nor deplorable. Mathematical\nphysicists do not wait until some concept has received its final\nexplication before trying to prove theorems about it; indeed, the\nprocess of theorem proving is often an essential part of conceptual\nclarification. The moral is well illustrated by the history of the\nconcept of a spacetime singularity in general relativity where this\nconcept received its now canonical definition only in the process of\nproving the Penrose-Hawking-Geroch singularity theorems, which came at\nthe end of a decades long dispute over the issue of whether spacetime\nsingularities are a generic feature of solutions to Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational field \n equations.[6]\nHowever, this is not to say that philosophers interested in time\nmachines should simply wait until the dust has settled in the physics\nliterature; indeed, the physics literature could benefit from\ndeployment of the analytical skills that are the stock in trade of\nphilosophy. For example, the paradoxes of time travel and the fate of\ntime machines are not infrequently confused in the physics literature,\nand as will become evident below, subtler confusions abound as\nwell.\n\n\nThe question of whether a Thornian time machine\u2014a device that \nproduces CTCs\u2014can be seen to be at work only makes sense if the\nspacetime has at least three features: temporal orientability, a \ndefinite time orientation, and a causally innocuous past. In order to\nmake the notion of a CTC meaningful, the spacetime must be \ntemporally orientable (i.e., must admit a consistent time \ndirectionality), and one of the two possible time orientations has to\nbe singled out as giving the direction of \n time.[7]\n Non-temporal orientability is not really an obstacle since if a given\ngeneral relativistic spacetime is not temporally orientable, a \nspacetime that is everywhere locally the same as the given spacetime \nand is itself temporally orientable can be obtained by passing to a \ncovering \n spacetime.[8]\n How to justify the singling out of one of the two possible \norientations as future pointing requires a solution to the problem of\nthe direction of time, a problem which is still subject to lively \ndebate (see Callender 2001). But for present purposes we simply \nassume that a temporal orientation has been provided. A CTC is then \n(by definition) a parameterized closed spacetime curve whose tangent \nis everywhere a future-pointing timelike vector. A CTC can be thought\nof as the world line of some possible observer whose life history is \nlinearly ordered in the small but not in the large: the observer has \na consistent experience of the \u201cnext moment,\u201d and the \n\u201cnext,\u201d etc., but eventually the \u201cnext \nmoment\u201d brings her back to whatever event she regards as the \nstarting point.\n\n\nAs for the third condition\u2014a causally innocuous past\u2014the \nquestion of the possibility of operating a device that produces CTCs \npresupposes that there is a time before which no CTCs existed. Thus, \nG\u00f6del spacetime, so beloved of the time travel literature, is \nnot a candidate for hosting a Thornian time machine since through \nevery point in this spacetime there is a CTC. We make this third \ncondition precise by requiring that the spacetime admits a global\ntime slice \\(\\Sigma\\) (i.e., a spacelike hypersurface without \n edges);[9]\n that \\(\\Sigma\\) is two-sided and partitions \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) into three parts\u2014\\(\\Sigma\\) itself,\nthe part of \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) on the past side of \\(\\Sigma\\) and the \npart of \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) on the future side of \n\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2014and that there are no CTCs that lie on the past side of\n\\(\\Sigma\\). The first two clauses of this requirement together entail \nthat the time slice \\(\\Sigma\\) is a partial Cauchy surface, \ni.e., \\(\\Sigma\\) is a time slice that is not intersected more than once \nby any future-directed timelike \n curve.[10]\n\n\n\nNow suppose that the state on a partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) with no CTCs to its past is to be thought of as \ngiving a snapshot of the universe at a moment before the machine is \nturned on. The subsequent realization of a Thornian time machine \nscenario requires that the chronology violating region \n\\(V \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}\\), the region of spacetime traced out by\n\n CTCs,[11]\n is non-null and lies to the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). The fact \nthat \\(V \\ne \\varnothing\\) does not lead to any consistency \nconstraints on initial data on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) since, by \nhypothesis, \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is not intersected more than once by \nany timelike curve, and thus, insofar as the so-called paradoxes of \ntime travel are concerned with such constraints, the paradoxes do not\narise with respect to \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But by the same token, the\noption of traveling back into the past of \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is \nruled out by the set up as it has been sketched so far, since \notherwise \\(\\Sigma_0\\) would not be a partial Cauchy surface. \nThis just goes to underscore the point made above that the fans of \nscience fiction stories of time machines will not find the present \ncontext of discussion broad enough to encompass their vision of how \ntime machines should operate; they may now stop reading this article \nand return to their novels.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nMisner spacetime\n\n\n\nAs a concrete example of these concepts, consider the \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional Misner spacetime (see \n Figure 1)\n which exhibits some of the causal features of Taub-NUT spacetime, a \nvacuum solution to Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations. It \nsatisfies all three of the conditions discussed above. It is \ntemporally orientable, and a time orientation has been singled \nout\u2014the shading in the figure indicates the future lobes of the\nlight cones. To the past of the partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) lies the Taub region where the causal structure \nof spacetime is as bland as can be desired. But to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) the light cones begin to \u201ctip over,\u201d \nand eventually the tipping results in CTCs in the NUT region.\n\n\nThe issue that must be faced now is what further conditions must be \nimposed in order that the appearance of CTCs to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) can be attributed to the operation of a time \nmachine. Not surprisingly, the answer depends not just on the \nstructure of the spacetime at issue but also on the physical laws \nthat govern the evolution of the spacetime structure. If one adopts \nthe attitude that the label \u201ctime machine\u201d is to be \nreserved for devices that operate within a finite spatial range for a\nfinite stretch of time, then one will want to impose requirements to \nassure that what happens in a compact region of spacetime lying on or\nto the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for the CTCs. Or \none could be more liberal and allow the would-be time machine to be \nspread over an infinite space. We will adopt the more liberal stance \nsince it avoids various complications while still sufficing to elicit\nkey points. Again, one could reserve the label \u201ctime \nmachine\u201d for devices that manipulate concentrations of \nmass-energy in some specified ways. For example, based on G\u00f6del \nspacetime\u2014where matter is everywhere rotating and a CTC passes \nthrough every spacetime point\u2014one might conjecture that setting\ninto sufficiently rapid rotation a finite mass concentration of \nappropriate shape will eventuate in CTCs. But with the goal in mind \nof proving negative general results, it is better to proceed in a \nmore abstract fashion. Think of the conditions on the partial Cauchy \nsurface \\(\\Sigma_0\\) as encoding the instructions for the \noperation of the time machine. The details of the operation of the \ndevice\u2014whether it operates in a finite region of spacetime, \nwhether it operates by setting matter into rotation, etc.\u2014can \nbe left to the side. What must be addressed, however, is whether the \nprocesses that evolve from the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) can be \ndeemed to be responsible for the subsequent appearance of CTCs.\n",
