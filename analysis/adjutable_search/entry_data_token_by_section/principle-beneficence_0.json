    "main_text": "The Concepts of Beneficence and Benevolence\n1. The Concepts of Beneficence and Benevolence\n\n\nThe term beneficence connotes acts or personal qualities of\nmercy, kindness, generosity, and charity. It is suggestive of altruism,\nlove, humanity, and promoting the good of others. In ordinary language,\nthe notion is broad, but it is understood even more broadly in ethical\ntheory to include effectively all norms, dispositions, and actions with\nthe goal of benefiting or promoting the good of other persons. The\nlanguage of a principle or rule of beneficence refers\nto a normative statement of a moral obligation to act for the others\u2019\nbenefit, helping them to further their important and legitimate\ninterests, often by preventing or removing possible harms. Many\ndimensions of applied ethics appear to incorporate such appeals to\nobligatory beneficence, even if only implicitly. For example, when\napparel manufacturers are criticized for not having good labor\npractices in factories, the ultimate goal of the criticisms is usually\nto obtain better working conditions, wages, and other benefits for\nworkers.\n\n\nWhereas beneficence refers to actions or rules aimed at\nbenefiting others, benevolence refers to the morally valuable\ncharacter trait\u2014or virtue\u2014of being disposed to act to\nbenefit others. Many acts of beneficence have been understood in moral\ntheory as obligatory, as determined by principles of\nbeneficence that state moral obligation. However, beneficent acts\nalso may be performed from nonobligatory, optional moral\nideals, which are standards that belong to a morality of\nmeritorious aspiration in which individuals or institutions adopt goals\nand practices that are not obligatory for everyone.\n\n\nExceptional beneficence is commonly categorized as\nsupererogatory, a term meaning paying or performing beyond\nwhat is obligatory or doing more than is required. This category of\nextraordinary conduct usually refers to high moral ideals of action,\nbut it has links to virtues and to Aristotelian ideals of moral\nexcellence. Such ideals of action and moral excellence of character\nneed not rise to the level of the moral saint or moral hero. Moral\nexcellence comes by degrees, and not all supererogatory acts of\nbeneficence or benevolent dispositions are exceptionally arduous,\ncostly, or risky. Examples of less demanding forms include anonymous\ngift-giving, uncompensated public service, forgiving another person\u2019s\ncostly error, and complying with requests to provide a benefit that\nexceeds the obligatory requirements of ordinary morality or\nprofessional morality.\n\n\nIt is generally agreed that ordinary morality does not require\nbeneficent acts that involve severe sacrifice or maximum altruism, such\nas a physician\u2019s putting herself, without protective drugs and\nequipment, in a life-threatening condition in an epidemic in order to\nprovide medical care. Such extraordinary beneficent conduct\ntypically derives from moral ideals rather than norms of obligation,\nalthough the line between obligations of beneficence and ideals of\nbeneficence is often difficult to draw. Saintly and heroic beneficence\n(and benevolence) are at the outermost end of a continuum of beneficent\nconduct and commitment. This continuum is not merely a continuum\nmapping the territory beyond duty (supererogation). It is a\ncontinuum of beneficence itself, starting with weak obligatory\nbeneficence (e.g., helping a stranger with mild disabilities enter a\nroom with an extremely heavy door) and then moving on to strong\nobligatory beneficence (such as rescuing a person in danger when the\ndanger is not severe for the rescuer). The continuum of obligation is\nthe first half of the continuum, which runs from weak obligations\n(e.g., such as conscientiousness in attending to a friend\u2019s welfare) to\nstrict obligation (as in the obligation to aid someone sitting next to\nyou who has been injured in an automobile accident when you have not\nbeen injured). The continuum then moves to the domain of ideals of\nbeneficence that are morally nonrequired, exceptionally virtuous, and\nthe like. An absence of any level of obligatory beneficence\u2014from\nweak to strong\u2014constitutes a defect in the moral life. But a\nfailure to perform high-level acts of supererogation such as heroic\nacts of self-sacrifice to benefit others cannot be accounted a defect.\nBeneficence is best understood as spread across this full continuum,\ndespite the considerable controversy that exists about where obligation\nends and supererogation begins on the continuum.\n\n\nA celebrated example of beneficence that rests somewhere on this\ncontinuum, and yet is controversial and difficult to locate just where\non the continuum, is the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan.\nIn this parable, robbers have beaten and left half-dead a man traveling\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho. A Samaritan tends to his wounds and cares\nfor him at an inn. The Samaritan\u2019s actions are beneficent and the\nmotives benevolent. However, they do not seem\u2014on the information\ngiven\u2014to rise to the level of heroic or saintly conduct. The\nmorally exceptional, beneficent person may be laudable and emulable,\nyet neither a moral saint nor a moral hero.\n",
