    "main_text": "\n\nIt is widely accepted that consciousness or, more generally, mental\nactivity is in some way correlated to the behavior of the material\nbrain. Since quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter\nthat is currently available, it is a legitimate question to ask\nwhether quantum theory can help us to understand consciousness.\nSeveral approaches answering this question affirmatively, proposed in\nrecent decades, will be surveyed. There are three basic types of\ncorresponding approaches: (1) consciousness is a manifestation of\nquantum processes in the brain, (2) quantum concepts are used to\nunderstand consciousness without referring to brain activity, and (3)\nmatter and consciousness are regarded as dual aspects of one\nunderlying reality. Major contemporary variants of these\nquantum-inspired approaches will be discussed. It will be pointed out\nthat they make different epistemological assumptions and use quantum\ntheory in different ways. For each of the approaches discussed, both\nproblematic and promising features will be highlighted.\n",
