    "main_text": "\n\n\nReism is the doctrine that only things exist. The name is derived from\nthe Latin noun res (\u2018thing\u2019). The interpretation\nof this very rough view depends on how things are understood. Reism\nwas anticipated by many nominalists (that is, philosophers maintaining\nthat only individuals exist) and materialists, particularly by the\nStoics, medieval doctrines of singularia\n(particulars) or Hobbes\u2019 considerations on corpora\n(bodies). Some tenets of reism are to be found in\nLeibniz. Brentano defended reism very strongly in\nhis later philosophy, when he argued against entia rationis\n(objects of thought; he meant by this objects which exist in thought\nalone). Brentano became a reist in about 1904 and attracted to this\nposition some of his younger followers (so-called younger\nBrentanists), like O. Kraus, A. Kastil and G. Katkov. The most\ndeveloped version of reism can be credited to Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski\n(1886\u20131981), a Polish philosopher and one of the leading members of\nthe Lvov-Warsaw School. He introduced the term\n\u2018reism\u2019 to denote the philosophical view that the category\nof things is the sole ontological category. In other words, reism\nreduces all categories to that of things. Yet reists differ in their\nviews about what exactly is included in the category of things. For\nexample, if one takes the Aristotelian table of categories (ten\nrubrics: substance, relation, etc.) the reist would say that\nsubstances interpreted as things are the only existents. Reism also\nhas a semantic dimension, for it recommends that only singular names, that\nis, names referring to concrete things, should be used, and\nabstract words avoided. Eventually, one can use sentences with\nabstract words provided that they have translations into statements\nwith singular terms.\n",
