    "main_text": "Modal Probability Logics\n4. Modal Probability Logics\n\nMany probability logics are interpreted over a single, but arbitrary\nprobability space. Modal probability logic makes use of many\nprobability spaces, each associated with a possible world or state.\nThis can be viewed as a minor adjustment to the relational semantics\nof modal logic: rather than associate to every possible world a set of\naccessible worlds as is done in modal logic, modal probability logic\nassociates to every possible world a probability distribution, a\nprobability space, or a set of probability distributions. The language\nof modal probability logic allows for embedding of probabilities\nwithin probabilities, that is, it can for example reason about the\nprobability that (possibly a different) probability is \\(1/2\\). This\nmodal setting involving multiple probabilities has generally been\ngiven a (1) stochastic interpretation, concerning different\nprobabilities over the next states a system might transition into\n(Larsen and Skou 1991), and (2) a subjective interpretation,\nconcerning different probabilities that different agents may have\nabout a situation or each other\u2019s probabilities (Fagin and\nHalpern 1988). Both interpretations can use exactly the same formal\nframework.\n\nA basic modal probability logic adds to propositional logic formulas\nof the form \\(P (\\phi)\\ge q\\), where \\(q\\) is typically a rational\nnumber, and \\(\\phi\\) is any formula of the language, possibly a\nprobability formula. The reading of such a formula is that the\nprobability of \\(\\phi\\) is at least \\(q\\). This general reading of the\nformula does not reflect any difference between modal probability\nlogic and other probability logics with the same formula; where the\ndifference lies is in the ability to embed probabilities in the\narguments of probability terms and in the semantics. The following\nsubsections provide an overview of the variations of how modal\nprobability logic is modeled. In one case the language is altered\nslightly \n (Section 4.2), and in other cases, the logic is\nextended to address interactions between qualitative and quantitative\nuncertainty \n (Section 4.4 and\n  Section 4.5) or dynamics \n (Section 4.6).\n",
