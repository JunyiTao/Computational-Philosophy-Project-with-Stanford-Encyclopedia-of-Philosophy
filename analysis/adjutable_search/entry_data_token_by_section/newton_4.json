    "main_text": "Newton's Life || Newton's Years in London and His Final Years\n1.4 Newton's Years in London and His Final Years\n\n\nNewton thus became a figure of imminent authority in London over the\nrest of his life, in face-to-face contact with individuals of power and\nimportance in ways that he had not known in his Cambridge years.\nHis everyday home life changed no less dramatically when his\nextraordinarily vivacious teenage niece, Catherine Barton, the daughter\nof his half-sister Hannah, moved in with him shortly after he moved to\nLondon, staying until she married John Conduitt in 1717, and after that\nremaining in close contact. (It was through her and her husband\nthat Newton's papers came down to posterity.) Catherine was\nsocially prominent among the powerful and celebrated among the literati\nfor the years before she married, and her husband was among the\nwealthiest men of London.\n\n\nThe London years saw Newton embroiled in some nasty disputes, probably\nmade the worse by the ways in which he took advantage of his position\nof authority in the Royal Society. In the first years of his\nPresidency he became involved in a dispute with John Flamsteed in which\nhe and Halley, long ill-disposed toward the Flamsteed, violated the\ntrust of the Royal Astronomer, turning him into a permanent\nenemy. Ill feelings between Newton and Leibniz had been\ndeveloping below the surface from even before Huygens had died in 1695,\nand they finally came to a head in 1710 when John Keill accused Leibniz\nin the Philosophical Transactions of having plagiarized the\ncalculus from Newton and Leibniz, a Fellow of the Royal Society since\n1673, demanded redress from the Society. The Society's 1712\npublished response was anything but redress. Newton not only was\na dominant figure in this response, but then published an outspoken\nanonymous review of it in 1715 in the Philosophical\nTransactions. Leibniz and his colleagues on the Continent\nhad never been comfortable with the Principia and its\nimplication of action at a distance. With the priority dispute\nthis attitude turned into one of open hostility toward Newton's theory\nof gravity \u2014 a hostility that was matched in its blindness by the\nfervor of acceptance of the theory in England. The public\nelements of the priority dispute had the effect of expanding a schism\nbetween Newton and Leibniz into a schism between the English associated\nwith the Royal Society and the group who had been working with Leibniz\non the calculus since the 1690s, including most notably Johann\nBernoulli, and this schism in turn transformed into one between the\nconduct of science and mathematics in England versus the Continent that\npersisted long after Leibniz died in 1716.\n\n\nAlthough Newton obviously had far less time available to devote to\nsolitary research during his London years than he had had in\nCambridge, he did not entirely cease to be productive. The first\n(English) edition of his Opticks finally appeared in 1704,\nappended to which were two mathematical treatises, his first work on\nthe calculus to appear in print. This edition was followed by a Latin\nedition in 1706 and a second English edition in 1717, each containing\nimportant Queries on key topics in natural philosophy beyond those in\nits predecessor. Other earlier work in mathematics began to appear in\nprint, including a work on algebra, Arithmetica Universalis,\nin 1707 and \u201cDe Analysi\u201d and a tract on finite\ndifferences, \u201cMethodis differentialis\u201d in 1711. The second\nedition of the Principia, on which Newton had begun work at\nthe age of 66 in 1709, was published in 1713, with a third edition in\n1726. Though the original plan for a radical restructuring had long\nbeen abandoned, the fact that virtually every page of the\nPrincipia received some modifications in the second edition\nshows how carefully Newton, often prodded by his editor Roger Cotes,\nreconsidered everything in it; and important parts were substantially\nrewritten not only in response to Continental criticisms, but also\nbecause of new data, including data from experiments on resistance\nforces carried out in London.  Focused effort on the third edition\nbegan in 1723, when Newton was 80 years old, and while the revisions\nare far less extensive than in the second edition, it does contain\nsubstantive additions and modfications, and it surely has claim to\nbeing the edition that represents his most considered views.\n\n\nNewton died on 20 March 1727 at the age of 84. His\ncontemporaries' conception of him nevertheless continued to expand as a\nconsequence of various posthumous publications, including The\nChronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728); the work originally\nintended to be the last book of the Principia, The System\nof the World (1728, in both English and Latin); Observations\nupon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\n(1733); A Treatise of the Method of Fluxions and Infinite\nSeries (1737); A Dissertation upon the Sacred Cubit of the\nJews (1737), and Four Letters from Sir Isaac Newton to Doctor\nBentley concerning Some Arguments in Proof of a Deity\n(1756). Even then, however, the works that had been published\nrepresented only a limited fraction of the total body of papers that\nhad been left in the hands of Catherine and John Conduitt. The\nfive volume collection of Newton's works edited by Samuel Horsley\n(1779\u201385) did not alter this situation. Through the marriage of\nthe Conduitts' daughter Catherine and subsequent inheritance, this body\nof papers came into the possession of Lord Portsmouth, who agreed in\n1872 to allow it to be reviewed by scholars at Cambridge University\n(John Couch Adams, George Stokes, H. R. Luard, and G. D.\nLiveing). They issued a catalogue in 1888, and the university\nthen retained all the papers of a scientific character. With the\nnotable exception of W. W. Rouse Ball, little work was done on the\nscientific papers before World War II. The remaining papers were\nreturned to Lord Portsmouth, and then ultimately sold at auction in\n1936 to various parties. Serious scholarly work on them did not\nget underway until the 1970s, and much remains to be done on them.\n",
