    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality || Superluminal signaling\n8.2 Superluminal signaling\n\n\nIt was also argued, notably by Jarrett 1984 and 1989 and Shimony 1984,\nthat in contrast to violations of OI, violations of PI may give rise\n(at least in principle) to superluminal signaling. Indeed, as is not\ndifficult to see from section 7.1, in theories that satisfy\n\u03bb-independence there is an asymmetry between failures of PI and\nfailures of OI with respect to superluminal signaling: whereas\n\u03bb-distribution and the failure of PI are sufficient conditions\nfor the in-principle possibility of superluminal signaling,\n\u03bb-distribution and the failure of OI are not. Thus, the\nprospects of superluminal signaling look better in parameter-dependent\ntheories, i.e., theories that violate PI. Yet, as we have seen in\nsection 7.2.1, if the Bohmian quantum-equilbrium distribution obtains,\nthen Bohm's theory, the paradigm of parameter dependent theories,\nprohibits superluminal signaling. And if this distribution is obtained\nas a matter of law, then Bohm's theory prohibits superluminal\nsignaling even in theory. Furthermore, as we remarked in section 7.1,\nif the in-principle possibility of violating \u03bb-independence is\nnot excluded, superluminal signaling may exist in theories that\nsatisfy PI and violate OI. In fact, as section 7.4 seems to suggest,\nthe possibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI\nbut violate OI cannot be discounted even when \u03bb-independence is\nimpossible.\n",
