    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n Montaigne (1533\u20131592) came from a rich bourgeois family that acquired\nnobility after his father fought in Italy in the army of King Francis\nI of France; he came back with the firm intention of bringing refined\nItalian culture to France. He decorated his P\u00e9rigord castle in\nthe style of an ancient Roman villa. He also decided that his son\nwould not learn Latin in school. He arranged instead for a German\npreceptor and the household to speak to him exclusively in Latin at\nhome. So the young Montaigne grew up speaking Latin and reading\nVergil, Ovid, and Horace on his own. At the age of six, he was sent to\nboard at the Coll\u00e8ge de Guyenne in Bordeaux, which he later\npraised as the best humanist college in France, though he found fault\nwith humanist colleges in general. Where Montaigne later studied law,\nor, indeed, whether he ever studied law at all is not clear. The only\nthing we know with certainty is that his father bought him an office\nin the Court of P\u00e9rigueux. He then met Etienne de La\nBo\u00ebtie with whom he formed an intimate friendship and whose death\nsome years later, in 1563, left him deeply distraught. Tired of active\nlife, he retired at the age of only 37 to his father\u2019s castle. In the\nsame year, 1571, he was nominated Gentleman of King Charles IX\u2019s\nOrdinary Chamber, and soon thereafter, also of Henri de Navarre\u2019s\nChamber. He received the decoration of the Order of Saint-Michel, a\ndistinction all the more exceptional as Montaigne\u2019s lineage was from\nrecent nobility. On the title page of the first edition (1580) of the\nEssays, we read: \u201cEssais de Messire Michel Seigneur de\nMontaigne, Chevalier de l\u2019ordre du Roy, & Gentilhomme ordinaire de\nsa chambre.\u201d Initially keen to show off his titles and, thus,\nhis social standing, Montaigne had the honorifics removed in the\nsecond edition (1582). \n\n Replicating Petrarca\u2019s choice in De vita solitaria,\nMontaigne chose to dedicate himself to the Muses. In his library,\nwhich was quite large for the period, he had wisdom formulas carved on\nthe wooden beams. They were drawn from, amongst others,\nEcclesiastes, Sextus Empiricus, Lucretius, and other\nclassical authors, whom he read intensively.  To escape fits of\nmelancholy, he began to commit his thoughts to paper. In 1580, he\nundertook a journey to Italy, whose main goal was to cure the\npain of his kidney stones at thermal resorts. The journey is related\nin part by a secretary, in part by Montaigne himself, in a manuscript\nthat was only discovered during the XVIIIth century, given the title\nThe Journal of the Journey to Italy, and forgotten soon\nafter. While Montaigne was taking the baths near Pisa, he learnt of\nhis election as Mayor of Bordeaux. He was first tempted to refuse out\nof modesty, but eventually accepted (he even received a letter from\nthe King urging him to take the post) and was later re-elected. In his\nsecond term he came under criticism for having abandoned the town\nduring the great plague in an attempt to protect himself and his\nfamily. His time in office was dimmed by the wars of religion between\nCatholics and Protestants. Several members of his family converted to\nProtestantism, but Montaigne himself remained a Catholic. \n",
