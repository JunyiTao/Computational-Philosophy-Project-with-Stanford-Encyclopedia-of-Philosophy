    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || The Instrumentalist Critique of the Natural Right Argument\n4.2 The Instrumentalist Critique of the Natural Right Argument\n\n\nA natural objection to this line of reasoning is to state that\npolitical authority is actually necessary to protecting each person's\nequal freedom. Locke himself argued that the state of nature would be\nquite threatening to each person's ability to live freely because there\nare likely to be many disagreements about what rights each person has\nand so people are likely to trespass on each other's rights.\nFurthermore he argued that when there is such disagreement, we need an\nimpartial judge to determine when rights have been violated. And\nagainst criminals we need a police power to enforce the rights that\npeople have. Locke argues that only by establishing political society\nwith a legislature that makes known and settled laws and establishing a\njudiciary that resolves remaining controversies between people and\nhaving an executive power that enforces the laws can people's rights\nand freedoms be protected.\n\n\nOnce we have the above argument in mind, it is hard to see the force\nof the natural right argument for no political authority without\nconsent. We might think that the very liberty that is being invoked to\nsupport the case for the necessity of consent is better protected by a\nreasonably just political authority. The instrumentalist can then argue\nthat one protects the liberty of each and every person better by\ninstituting political authority and by treating its commands as\nauthoritative. And so the instrumentalist could argue that insofar as\nliberty is a fundamental value, it would be immoral not to support a\nreasonably just political authority and treat its commands as\nauthoritative.\n\n\nThe natural right theorist might argue in response that the above\nargument seems to involve a kind of utilitarianism of rights. Such a\nview says that it is justified to violate one person's right in order\nto protect the rights of others. But, such a theorist might say, the\nnatural rights of persons are side constraints against actions; they\nare not to be violated even if others' rights are better protected as\na consequence. This entry will not go into the many issues that arise\nin the discussion of deontology and consequentialism here. We will\nreturn to the issue of side constraints after the discussion of the\nnext argument.\n",
