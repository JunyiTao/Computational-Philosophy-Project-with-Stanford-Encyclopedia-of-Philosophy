    "main_text": "Knowledge and Truth\n2. Knowledge and Truth\n\n\nRather unusual in scholastic production, the Summa by Henry\ndoes not open with a direct treatment of God, but with a lengthy\nanalysis of the problem of human knowledge, beginning with the\nsceptic's question par excellence: can man know anything\nat all (art. 1, q. 1)? Henry refuses to pursue in depth\nAugustine's radical theory in q. 9 of De diversis\nquaestionibus 83 that we should not expect sincera\nveritas from the senses. As generally agreed after the rediscovery\nof Aristotle's works by the Latin West, since all knowledge\noriginates in the senses, denying any value whatsoever to sensation\nwould mean denying all possibility of knowledge in general. Taking\nknowledge (scire: to know) in its most generic sense, for\nHenry it is undeniable that man knows something; Augustine's\nreservations should be taken to refer to those who claim that judgment\nis co-extensive with sensation. If we distinguish sensorial\napprehension from the intellect's judgment of it, then it is\nperfectly legitimate to expect truth (or a certain kind of truth) from\nthe senses.\n\n\nThe next question of the same article (q. 2) poses the same initial\nproblem in a more round-about way: can man know anything without divine\nintervention? Along traditional Augustinian lines, the reply should be\nnegative, since all true knowledge can only come from divine\nillumination. But a unilateral solution of this type represents for\nHenry a serious attack on the dignity of the rational soul. The\nessential operation of the soul is constituted by knowledge; therefore\nif knowledge were not already included, at least partially, in its\nnatural possibilities, the soul would paradoxically find itself\nconstituted for an aim that it could never achieve. Moreover, since the\nsenses provide true material, the intellect is certainly able to search\nfor truth: \u201cabsolute ergo concedere oportet quod homo per suam\nanimam absque omni speciali divina illustratione potest aliqua\ncognoscere, et hoc ex puris naturalibus.\u201d (\u201cOne must\ntherefore concede, in an absolute sense, that through his soul man can\nknow something without any special divine illumination, on the basis of\nwhat is purely natural\u201d; Summa, art. 1, q. 2, ed.\nWilson, p. 35, ll. 118-120).\n\n\nHowever, the above concerns knowledge in general, scire in\nthe broadest sense. Moving on to knowledge in the strict sense,\nproprie scire or certitudinaliter scire, things get\nmore complicated. As in Augustine's Soliloquia, it is\nimportant to distinguish between what is true and truth itself.\nSensation only grasps id quod verum est (\u201cwhat is\ntrue,\u201d and something is true in that it is a being on the basis\nof the simple conversion of transcendentals). Knowledge of the truth\nimplies something more; it implies the knowledge of the nature \u2014\nthe essence \u2014 of a thing, a knowledge that can only be obtained\nby comparing the res to its exemplar (\u201cintentio\nenim veritatis in re apprehendi non potest nisi apprehendendo\nconformitatem eius ad suum exemplar\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe intention\nof truth in a thing cannot be apprehended without apprehending its\nconformity to its exemplar\u201d).\n\n\nHere it is important to distinguish further, since the\nexemplar is a double one. In the first place, the\nexemplar is the universal species of the object that\nthe mind obtains by abstraction, on the basis of sensible data. In this\ncase, the truth of the res is the conformity between the\nreally existing thing and its mental representation; this conformity\ncan only be grasped by the dividing and composing intellect, in the\nclassic Aristotelian and Thomist formula, and not by the simplex\nintelligentia. In the second place, the exemplar is the\nideal form present in the divine mind that acts as the formal cause of\ncreatural essences, and from this perspective the veritas of\nthe res is its ontological conformity (Anselm's\nrectitudo) to its eternal model. This double relation\n(res-mens, res-exemplar aeternum) thereby produces a\ndouble truth, or two different levels of truth: on the one hand, the\nveritas of Aristotelian science, deriving from the purely\nnatural faculties, through an abstracting process, and on the other,\nthe sincera veritas, obtained only through divine illumination\n\u2014 in other words, by an act of God, not as obiectum\ncognitum (known object) but as ratio cognoscendi (cause\nor reason of knowledge).\n\n\nThe first truth does not have the same infallibility, purity and\nabsolute certainty as the second; nevertheless, it is still a form of\nveritas, no matter how \u201cimperfecta, obscura et\nnebulosa\u201d (\u201cimperfect, obscure and uncertain\u201d).\nIndeed, it is a form that is absolutely necessary for the fulfilment of\nthe second: the action of the divine exemplar can only work on\na concept already obtained by the intellect through abstraction. For\nHenry, divine illumination does not directly provide the mind with any\ncontent, but rather certifies definitively (with the typical\nAugustinian image of the seal) the representation of a thing present in\nthe human intellect, as coinciding with the representation existing\nab aeterno in the divine intellect.\n\n\nIn this way, Henry creates a unique blend of Aristotle's\ntheory of abstraction and Augustine's doctrine of divine\nillumination. Truth is the result of the comparison between two\nexemplars: the Aristotelian universal obtained by abstraction from\nsensible data, and the archetype present in the divine mind, which is\nnot only the cause of the existence of things, but also their epistemic\nguarantee, so to speak. The action of divine illumination is therefore\nneither a direct donation of intelligible contents, independent of the\nconditions of sensible knowledge, nor is it a simple purification,\npreparation or refinement of the mind in order to predispose it to\nintellectual knowledge. Rather, it is the certification of our created\nexemplar by the uncreated one; in other words, by divine art\n(ars).\n\n\nOver the years, however, Henry seems gradually to abandon this\ntheory of the double exemplar in order to make room, on the\none hand, for a reworking of the defining process of essences through\ntheir progressive determination, as described by Aristotle in the\nPosterior Analytics (Marrone 1985, 2001 and 2011), and on the other,\nfor a reinterpretation of illumination as the constant presence in act,\nalbeit in a recess of the mind (abditum mentis), of the image\nof God (Quodl. IX, q. 15). Concerning the first aspect, it is\nworth noting that in the Summa articles dedicated to the\nknowableness of God, an exact epistemological process is described,\naccording to the scheme of the Posterior Analytics, that\nbegins with the pure acquisition of the name of a thing, proceeds to\nthe ascertainment of its essential being (the fact that a given thing\nis possible and not a mere figment), and arrives at knowledge of a\nres in itself through its definition and the successive\ndetermination of its other essential features and properties by means\nof an operation of the composing and dividing intellect. Concerning the\nsecond aspect, this theme would find an indirect echo in the doctrine\nof the ground of the soul elaborated by Dietrich of Freiberg and\nMeister Eckhart. This presence, to which the mind is constantly\ndirected without any mediation, albeit through an operation of which we\nare almost always unaware (intelligere abditum), is for Henry\nwhat directs the mind itself to all authentic knowledge (Emery\n2001).\n\n\nIn this evolution, particularly important is the partial rejection\nof the function of intelligible species (for example, in\nQuodl. III, q. 1 and Quodl. IV, q. 7), which\nanticipates the similar Nominalist solution by a couple of decades at\nleast. More precisely, for Henry, the phantasm itself is made\nimmaterial by the abstraction of the agent intellect and imprints\nitself on the possible intellect, without the mediation of the\nintelligible species. In other words, on the basis of the principle of\neconomy, there is no need to have an intelligible species that is\nnumerically distinct from the phantasm itself, as in Aquinas\u2019\nstandard doctrine. The particular phantasm is made a universal\nphantasm by means of abstraction, and just as the universal cannot\nreally be distinguished from particular things, so the universal\nphantasm cannot really be distinguished from the particular. The\nphantasm is therefore the efficient cause of intellectual knowledge, or\nbetter, of the first operation of the intellect (that of simple\nunderstanding).\n\n\nHenry does not eliminate sensible species, however, nor does he\neliminate all types of representation in the sphere of intellectual\nactivity. Indeed, after the phantasms are impressed on the possible or\npotential intellect, making simple understanding possible, the\nintellect then forms complex judgments and produces its own species, or\nverbum (mental word), as a result of this activity. Even when\nHenry expounds the theory of the double exemplar, he always\nmaintains that the divine exemplar acts on the verbum\nalready formed by the intellect at the first level of knowledge,\nrefining and transforming it into a second, more perfect,\nverbum that can represent the truth at the level of\nsincera veritas (Goehring 2011). This clearly differentiates Henry from\nanti-representationalists like Olivi and Ockham in his later phase,\neven though Henry remains one of the first\nauthoritative masters to eliminate the mediation of intelligible\nspecies explicitly on the basis of the principle of economy (as is made\nfurther evident by the reactions of his contemporaries and the masters\nof the next generation).\n",
