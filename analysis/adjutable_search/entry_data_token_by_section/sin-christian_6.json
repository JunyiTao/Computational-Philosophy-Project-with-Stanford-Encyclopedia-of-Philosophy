    "main_text": "Sin as State || Sin as Uncleanness\n4.1 Sin as Uncleanness\n\nIn addition to thinking of sin in terms of action and/or dispositions,\nparts of the Christian tradition also think of sin as in terms of an\nontological state. Marilyn McCord Adams, for instance, thinks of sin,\nat its most basic level, as ontological \u201cuncleanness\u201d. On\nthis view, sin is fundamentally an\n\n\nimpropriety in the relation between God and created person.\u2026\nSin is uncleanness arising from the incommensuration of Divine and\ncreated natures, in the incapacity of any finite being to do or to be\nanything, naturally or intrinsically, worthy of God. (M. Adams 1991:\n20f)\n\n\nThis incommensuration is\n\n\na metaphysically necessary consequence of what God and creatures are,\nnot the outcome of the free and contingent exercise of anyone\u2019s\nagency. (M. Adams 1991: 21)\n\n\nElsewhere, McCord Adams describes it as an outgrowth of \u201cthe\nmetaphysical gap\u201d between humans and God, in virtue of\ndifferences in their natures:\n\n\nWe have no more rightful place in God\u2019s household than worms and\nmaggots do in our ours (Job 24:4\u20136); nothing we could naturally\nbe or do would make us suitable for Divine company. Because Divine and\ncreated natures are incommensurate, God will be unclassifiable\nrelative to any merely human order (social, political, international)\nor to any human perception of natural order. Since we are unable to\nfit Him into any of our categories, we experience God as \u2026\nwholly other, and therefore as utterly unpredictable. (M. Adams 1999:\n94)\n\n\nThis state of uncleanness, on her view, isn\u2019t a result of sinful\nactions but is instead simply a function of the radical limitation and\nfinitude of created natures in comparison with God.\n\n\nBecause of the size gap nothing we could be or do could\ncount\u2014simply by virtue of what it is\u2014as an appropriate\nmove in relation to God. (M. Adams 1999: 95)\n\n\nBecause sin is primarily a function of our created state rather than a\nresult of human actions, this view doesn\u2019t portray human freedom\nor forgiveness as playing a key role overcoming the state of sin.\nRather, the gap is straddled by covenant and, ultimately,\nincarnation.\n",
