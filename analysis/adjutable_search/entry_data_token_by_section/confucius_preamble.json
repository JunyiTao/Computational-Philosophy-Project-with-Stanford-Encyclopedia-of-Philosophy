    "main_text": "\n\nAt different times in Chinese history, Confucius (trad. 551\u2013479\nBCE) has been portrayed as a teacher, advisor, editor, philosopher,\nreformer, and prophet. The name Confucius, a Latinized combination of\nthe surname Kong \u5b54 with an honorific suffix \u201cMaster\u201d\n(fuzi \u592b\u5b50), has also come to be used as a global metonym for\ndifferent aspects of traditional East Asian society. This association\nof Confucius with many of the foundational concepts and cultural\npractices in East Asia, and his casting as a progenitor of\n\u201cEastern\u201d thought in Early Modern Europe, make him\narguably the most significant thinker in East Asian history. Yet while\nearly sources preserve biographical details about Master Kong,\ndialogues and stories about him in early texts like the\nAnalects (Lunyu \u8ad6\u8a9e) reflect a diversity of\nrepresentations and concerns, strands of which were later\ndifferentially selected and woven together by interpreters intent on\nappropriating or condemning particular associated views and\ntraditions. This means that the philosophy of Confucius is\nhistorically underdetermined, and it is possible to trace multiple\nsets of coherent doctrines back to the early period, each grounded in\ndifferent sets of classical sources and schools of interpretation\nlinked to his name. After introducing key texts and interpreters,\nthen, this entry explores three principal interconnected areas of\nconcern: a psychology of ritual that describes how ideal social forms\nregulate individuals, an ethics rooted in the cultivation of a set of\npersonal virtues, and a theory of society and politics based on\nnormative views of the family and the state.\n\nEach of these areas has unique features that were developed by later\nthinkers, some of whom have been identified as\n\u201cConfucians\u201d, even though that term is not well-defined.\nThe Chinese term Ru (\u5112) predates Confucius, and\nconnoted specialists in ritual and music, and later experts in\nClassical Studies. Ru is routinely translated\ninto English as \u201cConfucian\u201d. Yet \u201cConfucian\u201d\nis also sometimes used in English to refer to the sage kings of\nantiquity who were credited with key cultural innovations by the\nRu, to sacrificial practices at temples dedicated to\nConfucius and related figures, and to traditional features of East\nAsian social organization like the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d or\n\u201cmeritocracy\u201d. For this reason, the term Confucian will be avoided\nin this entry, which will focus on the philosophical aspects of the\nthought of Confucius (the Latinization used for \u201cMaster\nKong\u201d following the English-language convention) primarily, but\nnot exclusively, through the lens of the Analects.\n",
