    "main_text": "Importance and Influence || Philolaus and Pythagoras: How original is Philolaus?\n7.2 Philolaus and Plato\n\nThere is the possibility that on his first visit to Southern Italy and\nSicily in 388\u20137 Plato met an aged Philolaus in Tarentum (D. L.\nIII 36). This would motivate Plato\u2019s allusion to Philolaus as the\nteacher of Socrates\u2019 interlocutors, Simmias and Cebes, in the\nPhaedo, which scholars have often dated in the years\nimmediately following Plato\u2019s return from Italy. The presentation of\nPhilolaus in the Phaedo is not particularly favorable;\nSocrates supposes that Cebes should have heard something from\nPhilolaus about the prohibition on suicide, but Cebes responds that he\nhas heard nothing clear on the topic from Philolaus, or anyone else.\nPlato may also be criticizing Philolaus when he shows the\ninconsistency between the doctrine that the soul is a harmony and the\nbelief that the soul is immortal (see 6.2 above). On the other hand,\nlate in Plato\u2019s life, in the Philebus, there is evidence that\nPlato had studied Philolaus\u2019 metaphysical system and derived fruitful\ninsights from it. At 16b4 ff. Socrates introduces a philosophical\nmethod which he describes as\n\na gift \u2026 hurled down from the gods to man along with a dazzling\nfire on account of some Prometheus. And the men before our time, since\nthey were better than we are and lived closer to the gods, handed down\nthis report about the things that are in each case said to be, that\nthey are from a one and many and that they have limit and unlimited in\nthemselves by nature.\n\n\nThere are a number of important correspondences between the\ndescription of the method of \u201cthe men before our time\u201d in\nthis and the immediately following passages of the Philebus\nand the fragments of Philolaus, e.g., the postulation of the limit and\nunlimited as basic principles, Plato\u2019s insistence that number is the\nbasis for all inquiring, learning, and teaching (16e; Philolaus, Fr.\n4) and the use of the musical scale as a central example of the\ncombination of limiter and unlimited (17b ff., Philolaus, Fr. 6a).\nThere can be little doubt that Plato has Philolaus in mind, and he may\nbe alluding to Philolaus\u2019 method of archai (Huffman 2001). It\nis clear, however, that Plato is not taking over Philolaus\u2019\nmetaphysical system wholesale but is rather using it as a way of\naddressing problems that have arisen with the theory of forms.\nMeinwald (2002) argues that Plato is either correcting or providing a\nsympathetic reinterpretation of Philolaus\u2019 system, which allows Plato\nto suggest a way in which knowledge of forms may be mathematical. This\nreinterpretation transforms unlimiteds into pairs of opposites, in\nwhich limiters set ratios. This interpretation agrees with Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim that Plato differed from the Pythagoreans in making the\nunlimited a dyad (Metaph. 987b23\u201327). It has been\ncommon to assume that the Prometheus in the passage quoted above is a\nveiled reference to Pythagoras (Hackforth 1958, 21; Gosling 1975, 83).\nYet, as we have seen, Aristotle never associates Pythagoras with this\nmetaphysical scheme, and Plato elsewhere presents Pythagoras as a\nfounder of a way of life and not as a master metaphysician\n(R. 600a\u2013b). Modern scholars may be overreading the passage\nin light of Pythagoras\u2019 fame in the later tradition. Prometheus was\ntraditionally the founder of all human arts through his gift of fire,\nand Plato here supposes that the philosophical method he describes\nmust likewise have been due to some Prometheus, perhaps under the\ninfluence of Philolaus\u2019 own allusion to Prometheus in his cosmology\n(see 4.2 above). There is no need to introduce Pythagoras into the\nstory (Huffman 1999).\n Philolaus\u2019\n metaphysics of limiters and unlimiteds is perfectly intelligible as a\nresponse to the problems raised in the tradition of Presocratic\nmetaphysics (see 2.1 above) and was not a gift either of Prometheus or\nPythagoras. Some have argued that other passages in the\nPhaedo (101b10\u2013104c9) and a passage in the Cratylus\n(401b11\u2013c7) show that Plato was both heavily influenced by and\ncritical of Philolaus (Horky 2013). However, neither Philolaus nor the\nPythagoreans are specifically mentioned in these passages and the\nsupposed connections to Philolaus are nothing like as specific as in\nthe Philebus and too general and indirect to be convincing\n(e.g., the concepts of odd and even in the Phaedo passage\nwere important to Philolaus but hardly limited to him).\n",
