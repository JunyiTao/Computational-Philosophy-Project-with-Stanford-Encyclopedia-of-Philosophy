By contrast, language dissociations arising during \nchildhood are sometimes held to bear strongly on the question of \nwhether language is innate. Pinker (1994:297-314) articulates this \nlatter line of thought, arguing that there is a double dissociation \nbetween \u2018general intelligence\u2019 and language in two \ndevelopmental disorders called Williams Syndrome (WS) and Specific \nLanguage Impairment (SLI). People with WS have IQs well below the \nnormal range (50-60), yet are able to speak fluently and engagingly \nabout many topics. Those with SLI, by contrast, have normal \n(\u224890) non-verbal intelligence but speak effortfully and slowly,\nfrequently making errors in their production and comprehension of \nsentences and words. Pinker argues that there is a double \ndissociation here, and that it supports the view that there is a \nspecial \u2018language acquisition device\u2019 that is separable \nfrom any general learning abilities children might possess. In \naddition, following Gopnik 1990a,b, and Gopnik and Crago 1991, he \nurges that the fact that the dissociation appears to concern aspects \nof syntax in particular indicates that the language faculty in \nquestion is the grammar faculty. Finally, and again following Gopnik,\nhe argues that since SLI appears to run in families and, in at least \none case, displays a Mendelian inheritance pattern, what we have here\nis evidence not just of a \u2018grammar faculty,\u2019 but of a \n\u2018grammar gene.\u2019\n3.6.1 Williams Syndrome\n\n\nWS is a rare genetic disorder with a complex phenotype. Physically, \nWS individuals display dismorphic facial features, abnormal growth \npatterns, gastrointestinal problems, early puberty, neurological \nabnormalities (including hypotonia, hyperreflexia, hyperacuisis and \ncerebellar dysfunction), defective vision and eye development, bad \nteeth, connective tissue abnormalities, and heart problems. \nPsychologically, in addition to their low non-verbal IQ and \ncomparatively spared language abilities, they display relatively good\naudiovisual memory but very impaired visual-spatial abilities, \nleading to difficulties in daily life (e.g., getting dressed). They \nhave outgoing personalities and are highly sociable to the point of \noverfriendliness, but also display numerous behavioral and emotional \nproblems (especially hyperactivity and difficulty concentrating in \nchildhood, and anxiety in later life). (Morris and Mervis 2000; \nMervis et al. 2000.)\n\n\nAs to their language, there is currently a debate in the literature\nwith regard to its normalcy. According to one point of view, the\nlinguistic competence of WS individuals is remarkably normal,\nespecially in comparison with that of similarly retarded individuals,\nsuch as those with Downs syndrome (Pinker 1994, 1997; Clahsen and\nAlmazan 1998; Bello et al. 2004; Bellugi et\nal. 1998). While rather unusual in their choice of words (e.g.,\nproducing chihuahua, ibis and condor in addition to\nmore usual animal words in a word fluency test) and despite\nan excessive use of clich\u00e9s and social stock-phrases, their\nability to use language, especially in conversational contexts, is\nmore or less intact. For example, they may appear relatively normal in\nsocial interactions, and their processing of conditional questions and\nability to repeat sentences with complex syntax is closer to that of\nnormal controls than to matched Downs syndrome controls\n(Bellugi et al. 2000: 13, 15).\n\n\nAccording to another school of thought, however, the language \nabilities of WS subjects might be more normal than those of Downs \nsyndrome individuals, and might look remarkable in contrast to their \nown marked disabilities in other areas, but nonetheless display a \nnumber of abnormal characteristics across a variety of measures when \ninvestigated further. WS language shows \u201cmassively \ndelayed\u201d early acquisition, especially of vocabulary (Bellugi \net al. 2000:11) and grammatical morphemes (Caprirci et\nal. 1996); overregularization of regular plural and past tense\nendings as well defective competence with regard to irregular nouns\nand verbs (Clahsen and Almazan 2001); \u201cinordinate difficulty\nwith morphosyntax\u201d (Morris and Mervis 2000: 467; see also\nVolterra et al. 1996; Karmiloff-Smith et al. 1997;\nLevy and Hermon 2003); and impaired mastery of relative clause\nconstructions (Grant et al., 2002), embedded sentences, and\n(in French) grammatical gender assignment (Karmiloff-Smith et\nal. 1997). Indeed, Bellugi et al., 2000, found that WS\nchildren's performance on a sentence-repetition task was\nindistinguishable from that of matched controls diagnosed with\nSpecific Language Impariment, or SLI (see below, \u00a73.6.2).\nFindings such as these lead experts such as Annette Karmilloff-Smith\nto urge \u201cdethroning the myth\u201d of WS' \u201cintact\u201d\nsyntactic abilities (Karmiloff-Smith et al. 2003) and move\nUrsula Bellugi \u2014 formerly a proponent of the \u2018spared\nlanguage\u2019 viewpoint \u2014 to caution that \u201cbecause their\nlanguage abilities are often at a level that is higher than their\noverall cognitive abilities, individuals with WMS might be perceived\nto be more capable than they really are.\u201d (Bellugi et\nal. 1999.)\n\n\nIn contrast to its cognitive profile, which is, as we have seen, a \nsubject of debate, the genetic basis of WS is known. It results from \na \u22481.5 Mb deletion encompassing the elastin gene ELN at \nchromosome 7q11.23; most cases appear to be due to new mutations. ELN\nis crucial in synthesizing elastin, a protein which holds cells \ntogether in the elastic fibers found in connective tissues throughout\nthe body and in especially high concentrations in cartilege, \nligaments and arterial walls. Failure to synthesize this protein \ndisrupts development in numerous ways, from the first trimester \nonwards, and gives rise through processes that are not well \nunderstood to the raft of symptoms associated with the syndrome. \n(Morris and Mervis 2000; Mervis et al. 2000.)\n3.6.2 Specific Language Impairment\n\n\nIn contrast with Williams syndrome, in which one sees comparatively \nspared language in the face of mild to moderate mental retardation \nand numerous physical defects, specific language impairment \n(\u2018SLI\u2019) is diagnosed when (i) non-verbal intelligence as \nmeasured by standard IQ tests is normal; (ii) verbal IQ is well below\nnormal; and (iii) obvious causes of language impairment (e.g., \ndeafness, frank neurological damage) can be ruled out. As one might \nexpect given these diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of SLI embraces a\nhighly heterogeneous collection of language-related deficits, not all\nof which co-occur in every case of language impairment. (Bishop, \n1994; Bishop et al,. 2000.) These include:\n\nproductive and receptive phonological deficits (e.g., difficulty\nproducing clusters of consonants, as in spectacle, and\nfailure to show categorical perception of phonemes differentiated by\nplace of articulation (/ba/ vs. /ga/) and voicing (/ba/ vs. /pa/);\nmorphological deficits (e.g., generation of past tenses or plurals\nby using affixes);\n productive and receptive syntactic deficits (e.g., analyzing\n\u2018reversible\u2019 passives (Katie kissed Jacob\nvs. Jacob was kissed by Katie), complex dative constructions\n(e.g., Katie gave Jacob the book) and anaphora (e.g.,\nKatie said that Sarah scratched her vs.  Katie said that\nSarah scratched herself).\n\n\n\nAs a consequence of this heterogeneity, SLI, researchers have \nintroduced a number of subtypes of the disorder, including such \nthings as \u2018Verbal auditory agnosia,\u2019 \n\u2018Lexical-syntactic deficit syndrome\u2019 and \n\u2018Phonological programming syndrome\u2019 (Bishop 1994). Also \nas a consequence, and in part because studies do not always \ndistinguish between different subtypes, the etiology of SLI in \ngeneral is not well understood (O'Brien et al. 2003), although \nrecent research suggests at least two distinct genetic loci are \ninvolved in at least some subtypes of the disorder (Bishop 2006). \nSome posit an underlying defect in the \u2018grammar module.\u2019 \nFor instance, Rice and Wexler (1996) attribute SLI individuals' \nmorphological deficits to a missing UG principle, namely, the \nprinciple of inflection, and Van der Laly and Stollwerk 1997, \nattribute some SLI children's difficulty with anaphora to their \nfailure to acquire Binding Theory. Others see non-linguistic defects,\nsuch as auditory, memory or processing deficits as the root problem. \nFor instance, Tallal 1980, 1985 argue that many SLI cases result \nfrom deficits in the processing of rapid auditory stimuli, giving \nrise to a failure to learn to distinguish phonemes correctly, which \nin turn leads to a failure to acquire other aspects of grammar. \nOthers, such as and Norbury, Bishop and Briscoe 2002 argue that such \nchildren's limited processing capacities are the culprit.\n\n\nWhile the varied symptomatology of SLI suggests that no unified \ntheory of its etiology might be forthcoming, the cause of the \ndisorder is comparatively well understood in the case of one subtype,\ninvolving a severe disruption of morphosyntax (i.e., the rules \ngoverning the formation of words from smaller semantic units, or \nmorphemes). This subtype, seen in about half the members of a large, \nthree-generation English family, the KE's, and in another, unrelated \nindividual, has been traced to a specific genetic mutation, the \nfunction of which is actively under investigation.\n\n\nThe KE family has received much press since the early 1990s, when \nGopnik 1990a,b and Gopnik and Crago 1991 (see also Gopnik 1997) \nproposed that their morphosyntactic deficits were caused by a \nmutation in a single dominant gene normally responsible for the \nencoding of grammatical features, such as function words and the \ninflections used to mark number, tense, aspect, etc. According to \nGopnik, the affected KE's are \u2018feature blind\u2019 as a \nconsequence of this mutation. And according to Pinker (1994), their \npedigree (Fig. 6) and specifically morphosyntactic deficits \nconstitutes \u201csuggestive evidence for grammar genes \u2026 \ngenes whose effects seem most specific to the development of the \ncircuits underlying parts of grammar\u201d (Pinker 1994:325).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The KE family pedigree \n (Image used by permission of Simon E. Fisher)\n \n\n\n\nOther intensive studies of the KE family, by Vargha-Khadem and\ncolleagues (e.g., Vargha-Khadem et al 1995, 1998;\nWatkins et al., 2002) have vigorously disputed the hypothesis\nthat the root cause of the KE's language disorder is a syntactic\ndeficit. Instead, they argue, the KE phenotype is much broader than\nGopnik's account suggests, and their \u2018feature blindness\u2019\nis merely one among the many effects of an underlying articulatory\nproblem. As characterized by Vargha-Khadem's team, the affected KE's\nspeech is effortful, \u201csometimes agrammatical and often\nunintelligible\u201d (Watkins et al. 2002:453), and shows\nimpairments not just in morphosyntax (e.g., regular plural and past\ntense endings) but also in the formation of irregular past tenses\n(where correct usage is lexically determined, rather than\nrule-governed) and in sentence-level syntax, particularly word order.\nComprehension, too, is impaired at the level of syntax as well as\nwords, and as is their reading of both words and non-words. These\nresults indicate that the KE's problems go beyond morphosyntax, and\nthe fact that affected KE's have significantly lower non-verbal IQs\n(by 18-19 points; Vargha-Khadem et al. 1995) than unaffected\nfamily members indicates that their deficits may be further reaching\n still.[28]\n Finally, affected KE's have trouble sequencing and executing\nnon-language-related face, mouth and tongue movements and show\nabnormal activation not just of speech but also of motor areas on fMRI\nscans (Liegeois, et al. 2003); this deficiency in\n\u2018orofacial praxis\u2019 supports Vargha-Khadem's hypothesis\nthat the root problem for the KE's is articulatory.\n\n\nAs Gopnik noted, the pattern of inheritance in the KE family suggests\nthat a single, dominant gene is responsible for the disorder. (See\nfig. 6) In the early 1990's, Fisher and colleagues began working to\nisolate the gene. First, it was localized to a region on chromosome\n7q31 containing about 100 genes (Fisher et al. 1997, 1998;\nO'Brien et al. 2003). Later, it was identified (Lai et\nal. 2001; Fisher et al. 2003) as the gene FOXP2, which encodes a\nregulatory protein or \u2018transcription factor\u2019 (i.e., a\nprotein that helps to regulate the rate of transcription of other\ngenes in the genome \u2014 in the case of FOXP2, the protein acts to\ninhibit transcription of the downstream gene(s)). In affected family\nmembers, a single base-pair substitution in the gene coding for this\nregulatory protein leads to the insertion of the amino acid arginine\n(instead of the normal histamine) in an area of the protein (viz., the\n\u2018forkhead binding domain\u2019) that is critical for its\nability to modulate the transcription of the downstream DNA. As a\nconsequence, FOXP2 cannot perform its normal regulatory role in\naffected KE family members.\n\n\nThe failure of FOXP2 to perform its normal role in turn leads to\nabnormal brain development in affected KE individuals. Studies of\nother animals and humans (e.g., Lai et al. 2003;\nTakahashi et al., 2003; Ferland et al. 2003;\nTeramitsu et al. 2004) show that FOXP2 is normally highly\nexpressed in both development and adulthood in two distinct brain\ncircuits, One is a corticostriatal circuit, in which inputs from the\nprefrontal and premotor cortex are modulated by the basal ganglia and\nthe thalamus, and then sent back to prefrontal and premotor cotical\nareas; the other is an olivocerebellar circuit, in which sensory input\nis sent via the spinal cord for processing in the medulla, cerebellum\nand thalamus before being handed on to prefrontal cortex. (See\nfig. 7.) The basal ganglia are known to be involved in the sequencing\nand reward-based learning of motor behaviors (Graybiel 1995, 1998),\nand the cerebellar circuit, while less well understood, is thought to\nbe a proprioceptive circuit involved in motor regulation and\ncoordination (Lieberman 2002). FOXP2 is expressed in homologues of\nthese areas in other species (e.g., canaries, zebra finches, rats) and\nin all species studied, these areas are involved in motor sequencing\nand coordination (Sharff and White 2004).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Two circuits in which FOXP2 is expressed. (Based on figures\nby Diana Weedman Molavi, The Washington University School of Medicine\n\n Neuroscience Tutorial).\n \n\n\nSo, what appears to be the case is that affected KE family members' \nlanguage difficulties result from a mutation in the FOXP2 gene, which\nresults in abnormal development of the striatal, cerebellar and \ncortical areas necessary for the sequencing and coordination of \nspeech-related movements of the mouth, tongue and possibly larynx; \nMRI scans of affected family members showing reduced gray matter \ndensity in these areas support this hypothesis, as do fMRI scans \nshowing abnormal striatal and cortical activation during receptive \nand active language processing (Belton et al. 2003; Liegeois, et \nal. 2003.)\n\n\nVargha-Khadem speculates (cf. Watkins et al. 2002:463) that those of\nthe KE's deficits that do not appear to be motor related (e.g., their\ncomprehension and reading problems, their difficulties with word \norder and syntax) are a result of impaired learning that itself \nresults from their motor deficits. For instance, impaired \narticulation could lead to impoverished phonological representations,\nwhich would then impair the acquisition of morphological and \nmorphosyntactic knowledge, which would then constitute a poor basis \nfor further syntactic learning. Impaired representation at all of \nthese levels would then express itself in receptive language and \nreading, as well as in the realm of spoken language. Another possible\nexplanation of the KE's non-articulatory deficits, which is not \nnecessarily in competition with the previous one, derives from the \nfact that the basal ganglia are also known to be implicated in \nworking memory (Bosnan 2004) and reward-based learning (e.g., \nclassical conditioning) that is mediated by dopaminergic circuits \nthat interact with basilar structures (Lieberman 2002). If \nreward-based learning and working memory are impaired in the KE's, \nthen this could explain not only their higher-level syntactic \ndeficits, but also their overall lower IQ (Lieberman 2002).\n\n\nNeither of these explanations of the KE's seems especially congenial \nto the linguistic nativist. For both tacitly assume that language \nlearning, including syntactic learning, is not (or not entirely) \nsubserved by special-purpose mechanisms. Rather, it is mediated by \nmore general motor circuitry (according to the Vargha-Khadem \nhypothesis) or reward-based learning and working memory abilities \n(according to Lieberman) that are also involved in other learning \ntasks.\n\n\nOn the other hand, however, there is evidence that FOXP2 is\nparticularly implicated in vocal learning and expression. First, it is\nhighly expressed in songbirds that modify their innate vocal\nrepertoires: in canaries it is expressed seasonally, when adult birds\nmodify their songs (Teramitsu et al. 2004) and in zebra\nfinches, it is expressed more at the time when young birds learn their\nsongs (Haessler et al. 2004). In addition, there is evidence\nthat the variant of the FOXP2 gene that is present in humans has\nundergone strong positive selection in the hominid line (Enard et\nal 2002; Zhang et al. 2002). The protein produced by\nhuman FOXP2 differs in just three out of its 715 constituent amino\nacids from that of the mouse, and a recent analysis (Zhang et\nal. 2003) indicates that two of these differences are unique to\nthe hominid lineage. According to Enard et al 2002, the fact\nthat these two differences are fixed in the human genome, whereas no\nfixed substitutions occurred in the lineage of our closest relatives,\nthe chimpanzees, suggests that those changes were strongly selected\nfor in our lineage; Enard et al.  put the date of fixation of\nthese changes in the human population at around 200,000 years\nago. This date accords well with at least some estimates of the\nemergence of modern human language, suggesting that the vocal\ncapacities underwritten by FOXP2 \u2014 and impaired in those lacking\nthe gene \u2014 are after all critical to language competence.\n3.6.3 The grammar module and the genetics of language\n\n\nAt this point, two questions arise. First, is there a double \ndissociation between language capacities and general cognitive \ncapacities to be found in a comparison of Williams syndrome and SLI? \nSecond, what does our current knowledge of the role of FOXP2 in \nlanguage development tell us about linguistic nativism?\n\n\nAs to the first question, there seems to be no double dissociation. \nFirst of all, WS individuals' language, while startling in contrast \nwith their level of mental retardation, is not normal; indeed, as we \nhave seen, it is indistinguishable on some tests from that of \nlanguage impaired individuals. In addition, as Thomas and \nKarmiloff-Smith 2002, caution, it is not at all clear that one can \nassume, in the case of a pervasive developmental disorder like \nWilliams syndrome, that apparently \u2018intact\u2019 competences \nare a result of normal development of the underlying neurological and\npsychological structures. That is, given the known capacity of the \nbrain to compensate for deficits in one area by cobbling together a \nsolution in another, one cannot assume that there is a \n\u2018language module\u2019 in WS patients which develops more or \nless normally despite other cognitive systems' being massively \ndisrupted. Thomas and Karmiloff-Smith argue that the numerous \ndiscrepancies between WS language development and that of normal \nchildren suggests that this \u2018residual normality\u2019 \nassumption is misguided in this case, thus undermining the claim that\nwhat is spared in WS is \u2018the language (or grammar) \nmodule.\u2019\n\n\nMoving to the other side of the dissociation, since it is hard to say\nexactly what about language is disrupted in cases of SLI, it is\ndifficult to determine whether this disruption is specific to\nlanguage, let alone grammar. While researchers like Van der Lely and\nChristian 2000, and van der Lely and Ullman 2001 argue that there is\na purely grammatical form of the deficit, which does support the\nhypothesis of a grammar module, this is controversial, as we have seen\nabove. Certainly consideration of the KE's does not support such a\nhypothesis. Their root deficit appears to concern orofacial praxis,\nrather than language specifically; and in addition, their\n\u2018general intelligence,\u2019 as measured by tests of non-verbal\nintelligence, while \u201cnormal,\u201d nonetheless appears to have\nbeen affected by their neurological and/or linguistic abnormalities\n\u2014 witness their scores 18-19 points lower than those of their\nrelatives. It is, in other words, unclear that there is any\ndissociation of language and general intelligence in this case at\nall. One can conclude that as things stand now, SLI seems to be so\nheterogeneous a disorder as to defy neat characterization, and that\nconsideration of this disorder does not support the view that there is\na language or grammar module that functions independently of other\ncognitive processes.\n\n\nThe second question asked above was: what can be learned about the \ninnate basis of language from a consideration of the KE's and FOXP2. \nIn a recent article, Marcus and Fisher (2003) argue that the kinds of\nresults discussed above offer valuable insights into the ways that \nlanguage is implemented in the brain and controlled (to the extent \nthat it is) by the genes. However, they refrain \u2014 rightly in my\nview \u2014 from drawing morals to the effect that FOXP2 is a \n\u201cgene for language\u201d or even \u201cfor \narticulation.\u201d The effects of FOXP2 are wider than this (it is \nexpressed in the developing heart and lungs, in addition to the brain\n-- REF) and the functions of the neural circuits in which it is \nactive are as yet too poorly understood to do more than gesture at \nthe ways in which FOXP2 is involved in constructing the human \nlinguistic phenotype.\n\n\nAll the topics covered in \u00a73 deserve books of their own. My aim\nhere has been to sketch the ways in which modern understanding of the\nmind reveals the inadequacy and implausibility of the claim that\nhumans have innate representations of UG that are responsible for\ntheir acquisition of language. There are likely many, many processes\nimplicated in the attainment of linguistic competence, that many of\nthem are likely specialized by natural selection for linguistic tasks,\nbut that many of them also retain their other, and older,\nfunctions. The linguistic nativist's theory views our acquisition of\ngrammatical competence as a simple matter \u2014 one that\ncan be described at one level of explanation, and in terms of a single\nkind of process. This is very unlikely to be the case. Multiple\nsystems and multiple processes are at work in the acquisition of\nlinguistic knowledge, and our understanding of language acquisition,\nwhen it comes, is likely to involve theories of many kinds and at many\ndifferent levels, and to resemble the theory of the Chomskyan nativist\nin few or no\n respects.[29]\n",
