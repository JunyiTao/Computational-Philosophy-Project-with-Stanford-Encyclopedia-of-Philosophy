Despite its name, Navya-Ny\u0101ya\nincorporates and develops classical Vai\u015be\u1e63ika metaphysics\nas well as classical Ny\u0101ya epistemology. The Navya-Ny\u0101ya\nauthors also develop a precise technical language through the\nemployment of which many traditional philosophical problems could be\nclarified and resolved. Navya-Ny\u0101ya techniques proved to be so\nversatile that they were employed, not just by philosophers, but also\nin poetics, linguistics, legal theory, and other domains of medieval\nIndian thought. The foundational text of this school was\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s brilliant and innovative Jewel of\nReflection on the Truth (Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i).\nThe school continued to develop for about four centuries, reaching its\nheights with the works of Raghun\u0101tha, Jagad\u012b\u015ba and\nGad\u0101dhara (Ganeri 2014). The sophisticated use this school made\nof its technical vocabulary made it increasingly inaccessible, and so,\nin the 17th and 18th centuries, several manuals or compendia were\nwritten to explain in simplified language the basic tenets of the\nschool. I will describe the philosophical principles of\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya based on a synopsis of the most successful of these,\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s The Manual of Reason\n(Tarkasa\u1e43graha; henceforth TS), together with its\nauto-commentary, the D\u012bpik\u0101 (henceforth TSD), This\ntext was nicknamed B\u0101la-g\u0101d\u0101dhar\u012b, a sort\nof \u2018Beginners Guide to Gad\u0101dhara\u2019. As well as\npresenting the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory of categories (a mixture of\nphysical theory, metaphysics and philosophy of psychology), and the\nepistemological, methodological, and logical techniques of the new\nNy\u0101ya system, The Manual of Reason interjects\nfascinating discussions on a wide variety of topics of philosophical\ninterest, making the text an enjoyable and informative introduction to\nlater Indian analytical philosophy (trans.

The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika System of Categories\n1.1 Methodology and Theory of Definition\n\nMost Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika texts are structured in one of\ntwo ways. They either follow a traditional Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\npattern, in which the categories and their various sub-groups are\ndiscussed in order, or else they follow a pattern employed by the\nBuddhist logician Di\u1e45n\u0101ga, and copied by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, in which each of the sources of knowledge is\ntreated in turn. The Manual of Reason, however, adopts a\nstyle of analysis due to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (the first commentator\non the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra). V\u0101tsy\u0101yana stated\nthat:\n\nThis [Ny\u0101ya] system will follow a three-fold procedure, viz.\nenumeration (udde\u015ba), definition\n(lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) and examination\n(par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101). Of these,\n\u2018enumeration\u2019 means the act of referring to each object\n[to be analysed] by name; \u2018definition\u2019 means [citing] a\ncharacteristic of the named object which distinguishes it from all\nother objects; \u2018examination\u2019 means ascertaining, with the\nhelp of the pram\u0101\u1e47as, the appropriateness of the\ndistinguishing characteristic for the object defined\n(Bh\u0101\u1e63ya before NS 1.1.3).\n\n\nThe heart of this method lies in the use it makes of definitions,\nconceived of as differentiating marks of the thing defined. The\nManual of Reason (TSD 3d) refines the idea: it defines a\n\u2018definition\u2019 of a class of things as any characteristic\nwhich is co-extensive with that class. A defining characteristic of\nthe class \u2018cow\u2019 is the property \u2018having\ndewlap\u2019. Note that this does not tell us what the\nessence of the class is\u2014it merely supplies us with a\nsyndrome or trait by means of which we can identify the thing\nin question. The Naiy\u0101yikas, we might say, have a\n\u2018diagnostic\u2019, rather than an \u2018essentialist\u2019,\nconception of definition. The purpose of the \u2018examination\u2019\nnow becomes clear: it is to see whether the alleged defining trait\nreally is co-extensive with the class to be defined, or whether it is\nfaulty, either by \u2018over-covering\u2019 (cf.\nativy\u0101pti; applying to things outside the definiendum)\nor by \u2018under-covering\u2019 (cf. avy\u0101pti; not\napplying to everything within the definiendum), or both. A properly\ndefining characteristic has to be, to use modern terms, both a\nnecessary and a sufficient property of the thing to be defined. We see\nthe pattern of enumeration, definition, and examination repeated again\nand again in Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts like The Manual of\nReason.\n1.2 What is the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika System of Categories?\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system of \u2018categories\u2019\n(pad\u0101rtha) is an attempt to classify in a systematic way\nall the different types of existent. Navya-Ny\u0101ya lists seven\n\u2018categories\u2019 of object: substance (dravya),\nquality (gu\u1e47a), motion or action (karma),\nuniversal (s\u0101m\u0101nya), particularity or\ndifferentiator (vi\u015be\u1e63a), inherence\n(samav\u0101ya), and absence (abh\u0101va). Of\nthese, the first six comprise the classical list of categories, found\neven in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra, while the\nseventh (absence) is a distinctive addition by the later school. Most\nof these types are themselves subject to sub-division: thus, there are\nnine types of substance, twenty four types of quality, etc.\n\nOne main question concerning this list of categories is whether we can\ndiscern any underlying structure or organising principle. This is\nrelated with another important question: just what is a category?\nThe Manual of Reason answers this second question by giving\nthe etymological analysis of the term\n\u2018pad\u0101rtha\u2019 (category):\n\u2018pad\u0101rtha\u2019 is the artha or meaning\nof a pada or word. The claim is that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\ncategories are in some way the metaphysical correlates of linguistic\nstructures. One way to make this claim more precise would be to note\nthe existence of striking similarities between the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika system and Sanskrit grammar (cf. esp. Faddegon\n1918). Another way is to observe a distinctive pattern of argument\nemployed, in which the hypothesis that a certain type of substance,\nquality, etc. exists is supported on the ground that it explains some\nfeature of our linguistic practice (for example, the argument that\nspace exists as it explains our use of directional terms.)\n\nAn alternative approach would be to seek some purely apriori\nrationale behind the list. Athalye (1930: 75) offers one such:\n\nA notion is either positive or negative, and so the external object of\na notion might be \u2018existent\u2019 (bh\u0101va) or\n\u2018non-existent\u2019 (abh\u0101va).\n\u2018Existent\u2019 things again are of two kinds, properties and a\ncommon substratum in which they reside. The latter is\n\u2018substance\u2019 (dravya). Of the properties, again,\nsome reside in many objects conjointly, others in individual things\nsingly. The first is \u2018universal\u2019\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya), while the latter class is again\ndivisible into properties that are stationary and those that are\nevanescent, i.e. \u2018quality\u2019 (gu\u1e47a) and\n\u2018motion\u2019 (karma). The remaining two categories,\n\u2018inherence\u2019 (samav\u0101ya) and\n\u2018particularity\u2019 (vi\u015be\u1e63a) are assumed\nto explain the special theories of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas.\n\n\nThis reconstruction of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system is not quite\nsatisfactory, for it relies on an unexplained and perhaps\nquestion-begging distinction between stationary and evanescent\nproperties, and leaves two of the categories completely unaccounted\nfor. Another reconstruction (also deficient) is offered by Potter\n(1977). When we look at The Manual of Reason\u2019s own\ndefinitions of the individual categories, it seems to be following\nthis approach. The Manual of Reason\u2019s definitions are\nas follows:\n\nSubstance\n\n(i)\n that which possesses the universal substance-hood;\n(ii)\nthat which possesses qualities (TSD 3)\n\nQuality\n\n(i)\nthat which possesses universals, and isn\u2019t a substance\nor motion;\n(ii)\nthat which possesses the universal quality-hood (TSD 4)\n\n\nMotion\n\n(i)\nthat which causes conjunctions (between substances);\n(ii)\nthat which possesses the universal motion-hood (TSD 5)\n\n\nUniversal\nthat which is eternal, unitary, and inherent in many things (TS\n82)\nDifferentium\nthat which exists in eternal substances and functions as their\ndifferentiator (TS 83)\nInherence\nthat thing which is eternal and a relation (TS 84)\nAbsence\n[No general definition given]\n\n\nThere are certain problems with this series of definitions, read as an\napriori reconstruction of the categories. In particular, the\ndefinitions of \u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018quality\u2019 seem\nto be jointly circular, unless we take as already given universals\nsuch as substance-hood, which make the definitions somewhat vacuous. I\nwill give another reconstruction, one which roughly follows the great\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika author Udayana (cf. Tachikawa\n1981).\n1.3 The Underlying Structure of the List\n\nFirst divide things up into the existents and the non-existents, the\nlatter corresponding to the category \u2018absence\u2019. Now take\ninherence to be a primitive, fundamental relation. Given such a\nrelation, the following three-fold division is exhaustive:\n\nthings which do not inhere in others, but are inhered in,\nthings which both inhere in others, and are themselves inhered\nin,\nthings which inhere in others, but are not inhered in by\nanything.\n\n\nWe want group (a) to correspond to the category\n\u2018substance\u2019. Unfortunately, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nclaim that wholes are distinct from, and inhere in, their parts. The\nonly substances which do not inhere in anything are the atomic\nsubstances (which for the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas correspond with the\neternal substances). Group (c) corresponds to the category\n\u2018universal\u2019, for universals are said to inhere in things\n(substances, qualities and motions) but do not have anything inhering\nin them. Group (b) comprises, the non-atomic substances, the qualities\nand the motions. Let us now divide this group into two: those which\nare inhered in only by universals, and those which are inhered in by\nother things as well. The former corresponds to the categories\n\u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018motion\u2019, for substances are\ninhered in, not only by universals, but also by qualities, motions, as\nwell as by other substances. Finally, we must find a way to sub-divide\nthe former group into qualities and motions. More traditional\nNaiy\u0101yikas preserve the distinction by saying that motions, but\nnot qualities, cause the substances in which they inhere to come into\ncontact with (or break away from) each other. This, however, appeals\nto the idea of \u2018contact\u2019, which cannot itself be defined\nin terms of our primitive relation inherence. Some radical\nNaiy\u0101yikas (especially Bh\u0101saravaj\u00f1a) claim that\nmotions are just a kind of quality, as their properties are so\nsimilar. The only remaining category is \u2018differentium\u2019\n(vi\u015be\u1e63a), whose members reside in and individuate\nthe eternal substances i.e. the atoms. The point, perhaps, is that all\nother things are individuated by the universals and wholes that inhere\nin them, but two atoms of the same substance are in all respects\nidentical. But if objects are individuated by means of what inheres in\nthem, then there must be something inhering in each atom which\ndistinguishes it from the others\u2014a \u2018differentium\u2019\n(see \u00a710.2).\n\nThis is a rough sketch, omitting many technicalities, of how the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers tried to build their system of\ncategories on logical principles (for an example of such\ntechnicalities, see TSD 3(c). The Manual of Reason points out\nthat a substance cannot be defined as the substratum of qualities,\nbecause of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrine that substances do not\npossess any qualities at the moment when they are created.)\n2. Physical Substance\n2.1 The Five Primary Physical Substances\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika distinguishes, among nine acknowledged types of\nsubstance, a sub-class of five\u2014earth, water, fire, air and\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\u2014to which it gives the name\n\u201cbh\u016bta\u201d (\u2018physical substance\u2019).\nA bh\u016bta is defined as a substance which possesses a\nspecific sensible quality\u2014odour, taste, colour, touch and\nsound.\n\nIt was, perhaps, originally thought that the five physical substances\nand the five sensible qualities are directly correlated, each quality\nresiding in one and only one substance, odour just in earth, taste\njust in water etc. (such a view is reported by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\nunder NS 3.1.65\u20136). This may give some insight into the origins\nof the \u2018five physical substances\u2019 theory, but it was\nrealised very early on that it is extremely implausible to maintain\nthat earth, for example, is invisible, or else that its colour is\nalways due to intermixture with fire (Bhaduri 1947: 133). The set of\ncorrelations between physical substances and sensible qualities is\nmore complex in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btras and\nlater texts, and is indicated in the following chart:\n\n\n\n \nodour\ntaste\ncolour\ntouch\nsound \n\nearth\nx\nx\nx\nx\n  \n\nwater\n \nx\nx\nx\n  \n\nfire\n \n \nx\nx\n  \n\nair\n \n \n \nx\n  \n\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\n \n \n \n \nx  \n\n\nThe orthodox Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view is that each physical substance\nis characterised by the possession of a particular type of sensible\nquality and the absence of certain others. Thus, earth is the\nsubstance endowed with odour, water with taste but not odour, fire\nwith colour but not taste or odour, etc. A drawback of such\ndefinitions is that we cannot infer, from the detection of a sensible\nquality, which type of substance is present. Later\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika therefore looks for a diagnostic set of\ndefinitions, one which seeks to find, for each substance, a particular\nsensible quality whose presence is indicative of that substance. The\nManual of Reason (TS 10\u201314):\n\nEarth is (specifically) endowed with odour\n\nWater is (specifically) endowed with cold touch\n\nFire is (specifically) endowed with hot touch\n\nAir is (specifically) endowed with touch without colour\n\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba is (specifically) endowed with sound.\n\n\nThus, although earth, water, and fire are all tactile, only water\nallegedly has cold touch. It seems that it could find no positive\ndistinguishing trait for air, and thus reverted to the older style of\ndefinition.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising to find a \u2018five elements\u2019 theory\ndefended still in the seventeenth century. Some modern writers have\ntried to represent these substances as metaphors for different\n\u2018states\u2019 of matter\u2014solid (earth), liquid (water),\ngas (air), and temperature (fire). This is, however, improbable, for\nit is nowhere said that a particular substance can turn from earth to\nwater to air. Perhaps it is a mistake to see the theory as belonging\nto physics at all; instead, bearing in mind the way the substances are\ndefined in terms of their sensible qualities, we might see it as an\nexercise in the logical analysis of the data presented by the various\nsense modalities to construct a (metaphysical) theory of the world.\nSuch a theory would, for example, explain the fact that there are\ncorrelations between what we see and what we touch by positing that\nthere must be types of things which can be both seen and touched.\nLikewise, the occurrence of tactile sensations with no correlated\nvisual sensations leads us to postulate the existence of substances\nwhich can be felt but not seen (air), and so on for the other\nsubstances. It is, after all, the existence of such correlations\nbetween different sense modalities which grounds an objective\nconception of the world (phenomena accessible only by one sense are\nmore likely to be thought of as subjective in origin).\n2.2 Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Atomism\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 10\u201314) repeats the\nconventional Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory that the first four\nsubstances (earth, water, air, fire) are each of two types, atomic and\ncomposite. An atom (param\u0101\u1e47u) is indestructible\n(anitya), indivisible (i.e. non-composite), and has a special\nkind of dimension, called \u201csmall\u201d (a\u1e47u).\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\u2019 standard argument for atomism is as\nfollows. It is an empirically established truth that whatever is\nperceived is composite. Thus even the smallest perceptible thing,\nnamely, a fleck of dust in a sun-beam, has parts, which are therefore\ninvisible. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas call the smallest perceptible\nthing a \u201ctriad\u201d (trya\u1e47uka) and claim that\nit has three parts, each of which is called a \u201cdyad\u201d\n(dya\u1e47uka). Does each of these parts itself have parts?\nYes\u2014for it is another empirically established truth that the\nparts of a visible thing themselves have parts (e.g. a piece of cloth,\nwhose parts, the threads, are themselves composite). The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas say that a dyad has two parts, each of which is\nan atom.\n\nThis argument establishes that there are objects too small to be seen,\nbut it does not demonstrate that some of them are non-composite. Why\ncannot the process of sub-division be continued ad infinitum? The\nManual of Reason\u2019s intriguing answer is that if such were\nthe case then Mount Meru and a mustard seed would have the same size,\nas each would have the same (infinite) number of constituent parts! An\nimplicit premise here (articulated by other Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas) is\nthat the size of a whole is a function of the size, number and spatial\narrangement of its parts.\n\nThe argument seems to be question-begging, for the implicit premise is\nonly true if atomism is already accepted. A non-atomist will say that\nthe size of an object is determined, not by its constituents, but by\nthe spatial boundaries of the \u2018stuff\u2019 it is made of.\n2.3 The Metaphysics of Number (sa\u1e43khy\u0101)\n\nThe Navya-Ny\u0101ya account of number has been likened in content and\nsophistication to that of Frege, and is indeed fascinating. The\nManual of Reason says only that numbers are qualities\n(gu\u1e47a-s), that they are the ground for numerical\njudgements, and that they range from 1 to a very high number called\npar\u0101rdha (1014. Note here again discomfort with the idea\nof infinity). The view that numbers are qualities is in fact\nassociated with old Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, and turned out to be\nirreconcilable with the structure of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nontological system. We may speak of there being three horses in the\nfield, but also of there being 24 qualities in the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika system. Yet a quality cannot by definition reside\nin another quality\u2014hence numbers cannot be qualities. This\nproblem led the Navya-Naiy\u0101yikas to develop a new account of\nnumbers, based on a new type of relation called the\npary\u0101pti or \u2018completing\u2019 relation.\n\nHere is a summary of their theory. Consider the following pair of\nsentences:\n\nThe table has wooden legs\nThe table has four legs.\n\n\nThe similarity between (1) and (2) suggests that we think of\nnumber-words as akin to other adjectives, i.e. as attributing some\nproperty to the object/s they qualify. The Ny\u0101ya say that, in\n(1), the property of being wooden resides in the legs of the table by\nthe relation of inherence. Can we analyse (2) the same way, as stating\nthat a universal property four-hood inheres in the legs? The new\nNy\u0101ya (esp. Raghun\u0101tha and Jagad\u012b\u015ba) answer in the\nnegative. For note that (1) entails\n\nEach leg is wooden.\n\n\nHowever, (2) does not entail,\n\nEach leg is four.\n\n\nThe solution offered is to postulate a new relation,\n\u2018completion\u2019, which relates the property fourhood to the\nfour legs jointly, but not to each leg individually.\nRaghun\u0101tha remarks that \u201cthe \u2018completion\u2019\nrelation, whose existence is indicated by constructions such as\n\u2018This is one pot\u2019 and \u2018These are two\u2019, is a\nspecial kind of self-linking relation.\u201d His commentator\nJagad\u012b\u015ba adds:\n\nIt might be thought that the \u2018completion\u2019 relation is\nnothing but inherence\u2026So Raghun\u0101tha states that\n\u2018completion\u2019 is a another relation\u2026.In a sentence\nlike \u201cThese are two pots\u201d, \u2018completion\u2019\nrelates the property two-hood by delimiting it as a property which\nresides in both pots. Otherwise, it would follow that there is no\ndifference between saying \u201cThese are two\u201d and \u201cEach\none possesses two-hood\u201d.\n\n\nThe proposal is that number properties are related jointly to objects\nby the many-one relation \u2018completion\u2019. I think we can\nsimplify this proposal a little without losing its essential\nstructure. Rather than saying, in a sentence like \u201cMars is a\nplanet\u201d, that the property planethood resides in Mars by the\ninherence relation, we would now say that the predicate\n\u201c\u2026is a planet\u201d is true of Mars, so to speak\nbuilding the inherence relation (or copula) into the predicate. In an\nentirely analogous way, we can build the completion relation into the\nnumber-predicate, which then becomes, if the number is n, an\nn-place relation. Thus the sentence \u201cVenus and Mars are\ntwo\u201d asserts of Venus and Mars that they stand in a certain\n2-place relation, the relation which is the number 2. The Ny\u0101ya\nidea, then, is that number-adjectives are n-place relational\npredicates, and that numbers are n-place relations holding\njointly between n distinct objects. It in no way follows from\nthe statement that the relation 2 holds between Venus and Mars, that\nit holds just with Venus, any more than it follows from the statement\nthat X is to the left of Y, that X is to\nthe left, full stop. On the Ny\u0101ya proposal, then, it looks as\nthough the troublesome inference is blocked because its conclusion is\nnot even well-formed, since the phrase \u201cVenus is two\u201d,\nlike the phrase \u201cX is to the left\u201d, is an\nincomplete or unsaturated expression.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya, we have seen, distinguish two relations, the inherence\nand completion relations. Their motive is, as we might now say, to\naccount for the distinction between collective and distributive\nproperties. For the recognition that the inference from \u201cThese\nare two pots\u201d to \u201cEach pot is two\u201d is invalid is\njust the recognition that the predicate two does not distribute over\nplural subjects. The Ny\u0101ya idea is to analyse collective\npredicates like \u2018\u2026are two\u2019, not as one-place\npredicates of aggregates or sets, but as n-place relational\npredicates, true of n objects jointly. But since such relational\npredicates still take objects as subjects, this indeed shows that\nrecognising the distinction between distributive and collective\npredicates does not force us to abandon the adjectival view. The\nNy\u0101ya, indeed, have a term for collective properties: they call\nthem vy\u0101sajya-v\u1e5btti-dharma or \u2018properties\nwhich occur jointly\u2019.\n\n3. Space, Time and Motion\n3.1 Space (dik)\n\nThe Manual of Reason\u2019s remarks on the nature of space\nand time are sketchy in the extreme. We must supplement them with\ndetails from other Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Ny\u0101ya authors. Even\nthen, the theories of space and time found in\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika texts have been studied very little,\nand we can only form a rough and inadequate picture at the present\ntime. The Manual of Reason\u2019s observations concerning\nthe notion of space are as follows:\n\nSpace is a substance (TS3)\nSpace is the \u2018ground\u2019 for statements such as\n\u201cthis is east of that\u201d etc. (TS 16)\nSpace is unique, ubiquitous, and eternal (TS16).\nSpace is an instrumental cause of every effect (TSD16).\n\u2018Nearness\u2019 (aparatva) and\n\u2018farness\u2019 (paratva) are spatial qualities of\nobjects.\n\n\nSpace is conceived of as that substance in virtue of which statements\nattributing distance and direction, such as \u201cA is to\nthe east of B\u201d (or \u201cA is near to\nB\u201d, \u201cA is nearer to B than to\nC\u201d, etc.) are objectively true or false. Space is thus\nan explanatory postulate: it is argued that we must postulate the\nexistence of a new (spatial) substance to explain the fact that\nobjects stand in spatial relations with one another. The problem is to\nmake sense of this claim. Bhaduri (1947: 216\u20137) does so as\nfollows (I paraphrase his account):\n\nImagine a sequence of objects A, B, C,\nD, \u2026, F, each in contact with the next,\narranged in a line. Now A is to the left of B, and\nB is to the left of C, and since \u201cbeing to the\nleft of\u201d is a transitive relation, A is to the left of\nC, etc. But, although A is in contact with\nB, and B is in contact with C, it is not\ntrue that A is in contact with C\u2014contact is\natransitive. Thus contact cannot be what spatially relates objects.\nWhat then? \u201cAccording the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, it is space\nwhich brings [A and C] into relation. Both are in\nconjunction with space and thus with each other through its mediation.\nSpace is that which turns the relation of conjunction into a\ntransitive relation\u201d (Bhaduri).\n\n\nThis explanation has a problem. It assumes that between any two bodies\nthere is a chain of touching material objects. But, given this\nassumption, we do not need to postulate a new substance with which\neverything is in contact, in order to create a transitive relation\nfrom contact. For we can define \u201cbeing to the left of\u201d\nthus: x is to the left of y iff there are distinct\nobjects p, q, r,\u2026t such\nthat x is in contact with p, p is in\ncontact with q, \u2026, t is in contact with\ny.\n\nPotter (1977: 92) refines the argument. We say that A is\nnearer to D than to F because there are more\nintervening objects between A and F than there are\nbetween A and D. Suppose however that between\nD and F there is no chain of material objects. How\nis it that we can still say \u201cA is nearer to D\nthan to F\u201d? Potter answers: \u201cIn order to provide\nthe material to explain this comparative judgement we must postulate\nan intervening series of entities, and these must be spatial\u201d.\nNote that this explains, not the transitivity of directional relations\nlike \u201cto the left of\u201d, but rather the magnitude of\ndistance relations like \u201cnear to\u201d. \u201cNear to\u201d\nis not a transitive relation. It accepts the basic premise that the\ndistance between two objects is measured in terms of the number of\nintervening entities, and postulates a series of \u201cspatial\nentities\u201d when there are no material ones present.\n\nThis explanation also has a problem, for space is supposed to be a\nsingle entity. Perhaps it should say that the two objects are in\ncontact with a \u2018segment\u2019 of space, and spatial segments\nhave magnitude.\n\nPerhaps the best way to construe the argument is as offering an\nexplanation of spatial separation without having to postulate\na series of mediating bodies. Thus, if A is nearer to\nD than F, and there is nothing either between\nA and D or between A and F, the\nbest explanation is that D is in contact with a nearer part\nof space than F.\n\nThe Manual of Reason says that space is\n\u2018ubiquitous\u2019 (vibhu), which it defines as\n\u2018being in contact with every sample of earth, air, fire, water\n(and \u2018mind\u2019) (TS14). This raises the question: is space\ninfinite in dimension, or the same size as the cosmos? If space is\ndefined in terms of the relations between physical objects, then it\nwould seem to have the same size as the cosmos. There are however\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika arguments that it is infinite. The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas say that most bodies are either\n\u2018long\u2019 (d\u012brgha) or \u2018short\u2019\n(hrasva) in dimension (TS25, Bhaduri 1947: 118), but that a\nbody\u2019s having \u2018long\u2019 or \u2018short\u2019\ndimension is unintelligible unless it has bounding, perimeter parts.\nSpace, however, has no parts and hence no boundary. Some\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas conclude that space has no finite dimension\n(i.e. is infinite); others that it has a special dimension called\n\u2018paramad\u012brgha\u2019 or \u2018maximal\nlength\u2019.\n3.2 Time (k\u0101la)\n\nThe Manual of Reason says of time that it is the ground for\nstatements about the past, present and future, that it is unique,\neternal and ubiquitous, and that it is the container of everything and\na instrumental cause of every effect (TS15+D). The conception of time\nmirrors that of space: it is that in virtue of which statements of the\nform \u201cA is earlier than B\u201d are objectively true of false.\nTime is said to differ from space, and thus not be identical with it,\nin the following respect: whereas what is spatially near or far varies\nfrom person to person, what is temporally near or far is the same for\nall persons (cf. Bhaduri 1947, Mohanty 1992). But why should we\nrestrict our attention only to presently existing persons?\n\nIn the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, Gautama mentions an argument\nagainst the possibility of present time remarkably similar to (and\nperhaps even derived from) N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments\nagainst motion. NS 2.1.39 (paraphrased): There is no such thing as the\npresent time, because, when an object is falling to the ground, each\npoint on its descent belongs either to the already-traversed sector or\nto the yet-to-be-traversed sector. There is therefore, no point on the\ntrajectory to which the present time can be attributed. The present\ntime is an imaginary point of demarcation between the past and the\nfuture. Gautama replies (NS 2.1.40\u201342) to this by saying (i)\nthat the concepts of \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 are\nrelative to that of the \u2018present\u2019, and not to each other,\nand (ii) that the denial of the present has an absurd consequence,\nthat nothing can be known perceptually, as perception functions in the\npresent. The point of (i), perhaps, is that even if the present is\njust a boundary, it is not thereby imaginary.\n3.3 Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Dynamical Theory: The Nature and Causes of Motion\n\nBeginning with Pra\u015bastap\u0101da (6th century C.E.),\nthe early Vai\u015be\u1e63ika authors took a rational and scientific\ninterest in the behaviour of projectiles and other moving bodies.\nTheir theory bears comparison with Philoponus\u2019\n\u201cimpetus\u201d theory, which was responsible for a paradigm\nshift in Western scientific thought. The Manual\u2019s\naccount substantially agrees with that already found in\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da, which is partially traceable to the\nVaise\u1e63ika-s\u016btra itself. The content of the\nrelevant stanzas can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nMotion is the non-inherent cause of conjunction and disjunction. It is\nof five types, four volitional (throwing upwards, throwing downwards,\ncontraction, expansion) and the fifth comprising all non-volitional\nmotion (including falling, rotating, flowing, etc.) (TS 5, 81).\n\nWeight (gurutva) is the non-inherent cause of the initial\nfalling motion of a body (TS 30).\n\nFluidity (dravatya) is the non-inherent cause of (initial?)\nflowing (TS 31).\n\n\n\u2018Impetus\u2019 (vega) is a dispositional property\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), as is \u2018elasticity\u2019\n(sthitisth\u0101paka) (TS 80). \u2018Impetus\u2019 is the\nnon-inherent cause of the second and subsequent falling motions of a\nbody (TS 30). Elasticity is that which restores something to its\noriginal state after it has been distorted.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the theory. A moving body possesses, at\neach moment in time, a particular \u2018motion\u2019, which is to be\nthought of as a momentary, quality-like property of the body. Motions\nare defined to be the cause of conjunctions or disjunctions. A\nconjunction with a (stationary) body is brought about by displacement\nin space. We are thus to think of the motion of a body as being either\nidentical with, or else the cause of, its displacement in space\nbetween two moments in time. A motion cannot be caused by another\nmotion (as that would lead to perpetual motion). A body is set in\nmotion by its possession of a quality like \u2018weight\u2019 or\n\u2018fluidity\u2019. It persists in motion by having a\ndispositional property, \u2018impetus\u2019 or\n\u2018elasticity\u2019, which is the continuous cause of subsequent\nmotions. It is brought to rest by coming into contact with other\nobjects.\n\nThe role of \u2018impetus\u2019 in this account is particularly\ninteresting. It is illustrated with reference to two examples: (i) a\nfruit falling from a tree; (ii) a javelin thrown obliquely\nupwards.\n\nAt time t0 the fruit is stationary at place\ns0. Its weight is counterbalanced by its contact\nwith its stalk. At t1, its stalk breaks and its\nweight causes it to move to point s1. At this time\ntoo there is produced in the fruit a dispositional\n\u2018impetus\u2019. At t2, the impetus in the\nfruit causes a second motion, from s1 to\ns2, and so on for all subsequent times. Note that\nthe \u2018weight\u2019 of the fruit is the cause of its initial\nmotion, but then ceases to be operative. The cause of all subsequent\nmotion is the \u2018impetus\u2019 impressed into the fruit by the\ninitial motion. It is this idea, that the subsequent motion of the\nfruit is the result, not of an external force, but of the internally\nimpressed vega, which licenses us to describe the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika account as an impetus theory.\nWhen the javelin is thrown, the initial volitional push imparts\ninto the javelin an initial motion and an impetus. The upwards impetus\ncounteracts the javelin\u2019s weight and causes its upwards motion.\nWhen this impetus is exhausted by contact with the air, the\njavelin\u2019s weight imparts a downwards impetus and the javelin\nfalls. The horizontal motion of the javelin is caused by its having a\nhorizontal impetus which again decreases as a result of contact with\nthe air. The amount of impetus initially acquired by the javelin is\nproportional to the applied volitional push. Once again, its is the\njavelin\u2019s having impetus, rather than the action of some\nexternal force, which accounts for its continued motion through the\nair.\n\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas extend this model to explain certain other\nkinds of motion. (1) The initial cause of the flowing of water is\nalleged to result from a force called \u2018fluidity\u2019 (rather\nthan the weight of the water). The subsequent flowing is the result of\nthe water\u2019s acquired impetus. (2) Interestingly, the impetus of\na body moving in a straight line was thought to be ontologically of\nthe same type as the elasticity of a bent stick\u2014a fact which\nreveals that impetus was thought of as a kind of internal force, not\nas inertia. (3) The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas mention various other kinds\nof motion: the movement of an iron needle towards a magnet, the upward\nmotion of flames, the movement of air, and the initial motion of the\natoms at the beginning of creation. Given the above model, there must\nbe some \u2018force\u2019 which initially gives rise to each of\nthese motions, yet none of the \u2018forces\u2019 so far isolated\n(weight/gravity, fluidity, elasticity) will do. The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas therefore speak of a new force,\n\u2018ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u2019 (the\n\u2018unseen\u2019 force), alleged to account for such motions.\n4. Selves: Human and Divine\n\nThe eighth of the nine Vai\u015be\u1e63ika types of substance is\n\u2018self\u2019 (\u0101tman), defined as the substratum of\nmental states such as believing, knowing, etc. (The ninth is\n\u2018mind\u2019 (manas), a distinct element in the\nontology of the mental.) Selves are divided into two types\u2014human\n(j\u012bva) and divine (param\u0101tman;\n\u012b\u015bvara). The Manual of Reason supplies\narguments (all traceable back to earlier authors) for the existence of\nboth types of self.\n4.1 A Causal Argument for God\u2019s Existence\n\nA properly formulated Ny\u0101ya argument has three components:\nthesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the \u2018locus\u2019 (pak\u1e63a) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (s\u0101dhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred. Thus every Ny\u0101ya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it has\nH; e.g., d. (For example: \u201cThe mountain ( =\np) has fire (= S), because it has smoke ( =\nH); e.g. the kitchen ( = d)\u201d. See further \u00a78). A\nsound argument must fulfil at least three criteria: (i) the reason\nproperty must be uncontroversially present in the locus; (ii) the\nreason property and the inferred property must be appropriately\nrelated, roughly such that wherever the reason is present, so is the\ninferred property; (iii) the example must be an uncontroversial place\nwhere both the reason property and the inferred property are\npresent.\n\nWith this in mind, let us consider The Manual of\nReason\u2019s argument for the existence of God:\n\nA dyad of earth etc. has a maker, because it is an effect; e.g. a pot\n(TSD 17b).\n\n\nHere, the locus of the inference is a dyad, the smallest composite\nentity. The reason is \u201cbeing an effect\u201d\n(k\u0101ryatva), and the inferred property is \u201chaving a\nmaker\u201d (kart\u1e5b-janyatva). The Manual of\nReason carefully defines what it means by a \u2018maker\u2019:\na thing which is non-inferentially aware of the inherent or material\ncause of the thing to be made, has a desire to make it, and acts\naccordingly. In this sense, the potter, but not the potter\u2019s\nwheel or the clay or any other causally relevant feature, is the maker\nof the pot, for it is the potter who sees the clay (= material cause\nof the pot), desires to make a pot, and acts accordingly by using the\nwheel and stick.\n\nComments: (1) Why does The Manual of Reason take dyads to be\nthe locus of the inference? This is, in fact, a clever move.\nObviously, we cannot take God to be the locus (e.g. God exists,\nbecause\u2026), for then the first criterion on a sound inference\nwill not be met\u2014the reason property, whatever it is, cannot be\nuncontroversially present in a locus whose very existence is\ncontroversial. We can\u2019t take the locus to be \u201ceverything\nin the world\u201d, for many such things are not effects (e.g. atoms,\nspace) and so The Manual of Reason\u2019s desired reason\nwill again not be unequivocally present in the locus. Hence, we must\npick some particular thing. We had better not choose a human artefact,\nfor the inference, even if sound, would then establish nothing about\nGod. From the class of non-artefacts, the choice of dyads is a good\none here, for (a) they are the most basic things made out of the\natoms, and hence out of which everything else is made, and (b) if\nThe Manual of Reason can show that these have a maker, then\nit follows that the maker is aware of everything (from the definition\nof a maker and (a) above). Thus, God\u2019s omniscience will be a\ncorollary of the proof of his existence.\n\n(2) The argument takes the picture of causation used in the\n\u201cpotter-pot\u201d example and extends it to cover all natural\nphenomena. God\u2019s function is to make things out of the given and\nuncreated ingredients (the atoms, cf. the clay), which are the\nproducts\u2019 material cause. Matilal accordingly describes the\nNy\u0101ya as having a \u201cpotter model\u201d of God, in contrast\nwith a \u201cspider model\u201d, in which God spins the world out of\nhis own essence, or a \u201cmagician\u201d model, in which the world\nis an illusion conjured up by God. The argument, however, rests upon\nan anthropomorphic and agentive view of causation. The Buddhist\nDharmak\u012brti ridiculed the argument by likening the pot to an\nanti-hill (another thing made of clay): should we say that this\nadmittedly complex and intricate construction is the product of\nintelligent agents? And even if we do, why should not the world, like\nan ant-hill be a product of collective agency, rather than produced by\na single agent?\n\n(3) The argument might be thought of as an argument based on\ninduction, induction from the class of artefacts to the class of\nnatural products. What licenses the induction from things seen to have\na maker to things not so seen? Dharmak\u012brti (cf. Vattanky 1984:\n56\u20138) says that we are licensed to infer that an object has a\nmaker only if we have seen other objects of the same type being made.\nThus, we can infer that the Pyramids had a maker, not because we can\nsee that maker, but because the Pyramids belong to a type (buildings)\nother instances of which we have seen made. The Naiy\u0101yika makes a\nbolder inductive claim, that two object belong to the same\n\u2018type\u2019, in this sense, if they are both effects.\n4.2 An Argument for the Existence of the Human Self\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika defines the human self as the substratum of such\npsychological qualities as believing, etc., as well as of happiness\nand other emotions, which God does not have. There is an implicit\nappeal, here too, to the \u201cpotter\u201d model of causation: just\nas, in the sentence \u201cThe potter makes the pot\u201d, the\nproperty \u201c\u2026.making the pot\u201d resides in the potter,\nso too in \u201cI believe that p\u201d, the property\n\u201c\u2026.believes that p\u201d resides in me. Given\nthat the self is defined as that substance, whichever it is, in which\na person\u2019s psychological qualities reside, the question is\nwhether we can identify this substance as a physical one, for example,\nthe person\u2019s body or their senses, or whether we must postulate\nsome new type of substance. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\u2019s argument for\nthe existence of the self as a new substance is by elimination of two\nrival candidates.\n\n(1) The substratum of beliefs, etc. is the person\u2019s body.\nThe Manual of Reason makes the case for this as follows: If I\nsay, \u201cI am cold\u201d, \u201cI am running\u201d, it is my\nbody to which the predicate applies. Therefore, when I say \u201cI\nbelieve that p\u201d, the subject likewise is my body.\nThe Manual\u2019s reply is that if this were true, then\n\nthere would be the difficulty that with the destruction of a hand, a\nfoot, etc., there will be the destruction of the body and it will\nfollow that there will also be the destruction of the self.\n\n\nClearly, I can lose part of my body without ceasing to believe and\nknow things. But losing part of my body does not entail losing my\nbody, as a whole. So this argument fails. A better argument is found\nin the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra: the very phrase \u201cmy\nbody\u201d shows that I am not identical with my body. But this\ndoesn\u2019t work either, for I can also say \u201cmy soul\u201d!\nThere is no clear argument against physicalism here.\n\n(2) The substratum of beliefs etc. is the person\u2019s\nsense-faculties [recall that every physical substance was divided into\nthree: pertaining to body, sense-faculty, and (inanimate) object].\nThis rather strange claim might be taken to include the view of the\nBuddhists, that a person is reducible to a stream of momentary mental\nevents, including sense-data etc. The Manual of\nReason\u2019s argument against such a view (a repetition of an\nargument already found in the Ny\u0101ya-sutra) is a strong\none:\n\nWere this the case, there would be no re-identifying awareness\n(anusandh\u0101na), e.g. \u201cI who saw that pot am now\ntouching it\u201d, for there cannot be any recognition by one of what\nis apprehended by another.\n\n\nThe idea here is that the possibility of recognitive experience\npresupposes the existence of a unitary enduring self. There are really\ntwo arguments compressed here. One is this: I cannot remember\nan object unless I have seen it earlier\u2014I cannot remember what\nyou have seen (cf. Locke\u2019s account of personal identity in terms\nof a continuity of memory experiences). The other argument is more\nintricate. The Abhidharma Buddhist claims that a person is just an\naggregate of experiences, some visual, some tactile, etc. The problem\nraised for such an account by the Naiy\u0101yika is that it is\npossible to make trans-modality judgements, in which the deliverances\nof one sense-faculty are compared with another. Suppose that\nV(o1) is a visual experience of an object\no1, and T(o2) is a\ntactile experience of an object o2. It is possible\nto judge \u201co1 =\no2\u201d, but this judgement does not belong to\nthe sphere of any one sense-faculty. Hence, it must be located in some\nother substance. The self is here conceived of as that which collates,\norganises and compares the deliverances of the individual senses. See\nGaneri 2012, chapters 11, 15, 16 for an expanded discussion.\n\nThis is a convenient place at which to introduce the last of the nine\nsubstances, the \u2018mind\u2019 (manas). It is defined by\nThe Manual of Reason (TS18) as a sixth sense-faculty, one by\nwhich a person \u2018perceives\u2019 their inner mental objects\n(beliefs, pleasure sensations etc.) In other words, it is a faculty of\nintrospection. Naturally, we need an argument why this faculty cannot\nbe identified as belonging to the self, and the usual Ny\u0101ya claim\nis that the self is the agent of cognising, while the mind is an\ninstrument for cognising, just as we must distinguish between the\naxe-man, who is the agent chopping the tree, and the axe, which is the\ninstrument for chopping. The Ny\u0101ya also claim that the mind has\nanother function, which is to \u2018switch\u2019 between the\ndifferent sense-faculties, it being assumed that, while we are being\nsubjected to sense-impressions from different faculties\nsimultaneously, we only attend to one at a time.\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 79) says that eight of the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika qualities reside only in the self, and in no\nother substance. They are cognition, memory, pleasure or happiness\n(sukha), pain or unhappiness (du\u1e25kha), desire\n(icch\u0101), aversion (dve\u1e63a), merit\n(dharma) and demerit (adharma) (TS 73\u201378). The\nfirst two we will discuss later (\u00a7\u00a7 5.2\u20133). As regards\nhappiness and unhappiness, Matilal (1986: 301), summarizes the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika view when he says that \u201cthe essential\ncharacteristic of pleasure or happiness consists in its being\nexperienced as favourable to us or being in accord with us, i.e. with\nour body or mind or our very existential situation\n(anuk\u016bla)\u201d, which makes it distinct from knowing\nor perceiving or apprehending something, and that it is an\n\u201cinner disposition on account of which the external world\nbecomes agreeable or desirable\u201d. Desire is the state of craving\nfor something. Merit is that which is produces by meritorious action\n(karma). See further Ganeri 2012, chapters 13, 14.\n5. Philosophical Psychology\n5.1 Overview of Philosophical Psychology\n\nStudy of the nature, content and causes of cognition (buddhi,\nj\u00f1\u0101na, upalabdhi) lies at the very centre of the\nNy\u0101ya philosophical method. In epistemology, the question asked\nis: how do we distinguish between true and false cognitions, and under\nwhat conditions does a true cognition arise? In logical theory, the\nissue is: when does one cognition \u2018follow\u2019 from another,\nin some suitably articulated sense. In philosophy of language, the\nassumption is that sentence structure mirrors cognitive structure, and\nhence that an inquiry into sentence meaning proceeds via an analysis\nof the cognitions sentences \u2018express\u2019. The importance of\nthis topic is reflected by The Manual of Reason, for although\n\u2018cognition\u2019 is technically just one of twenty-four types\nof quality in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika schema, its analysis accounts\nfor nearly half of the book (TS 34\u201374).\n\nThe term \u2018cognition\u2019 is used by the Naiy\u0101yikas to\nrefer to any intentional (sa-vi\u1e63ayaka; object-directed)\nmental state, including states of perceiving, inferring, doubting,\nguessing, remembering, etc., but excluding desiring, hoping,\nsuffering, etc. (cf. Matilal 1968: 7\u20138). Because we say that the\nsubject has such states, they are thought to be\n\u2018qualities\u2019 (in the technical Vai\u015be\u1e63ika sense)\nof the soul. The Manual of Reason states that a cognition is\nthe \u201cground for all linguistic practice\u201d (TS 34),\nreflecting the Ny\u0101ya conception of language as primarily an\ninstrument for transmitting true thoughts from speaker to hearer.\n\nFrom the point of view of epistemology, the most important division,\nwithin the class of cognitions, is between those which are true and\nthe rest. However, the standard Ny\u0101ya classification of the\nspecies of cognition, repeated by The Manual of Reason,\nbegins with another division, between memory cognitions\n(sm\u1e5bti) and the remainder (anubhava;\nnonrecollective cognition). The full classification is as follows:\n\n\ncognition \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nnonrecollective\n                 (anubhava)\n\nmemory\n                 (sm\u1e5bti)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\ntrue (pram\u0101)\n   perceptual \n   inferential \n   comparison-based \n   testimony-based\nnot true (apram\u0101)\n   false (viparyaya; 4 types)\n   doubt (sa\u1e43\u015baya)\n   tarka\n\n\u2018true\u2019 (yath\u0101rtha)\n\u2018not true\u2019 (ayath\u0101rtha)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nNy\u0101ya epistemology is in effect a theory of the true\nnonrecollective cognitions, and their division into four types on the\nbasis of the different accredited epistemic means\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a-s) by which they are produced. (What\nabout accidentally true cognitions, e.g. the result of a lucky guess?\nThere are well-discussed problems with incorporating them into the\nabove schema). It is clear that, no matter how generally reliable are\nour epistemic methods, it will always be possible for misfires to\nissue occasionally in false cognitions (e.g. perceptual illusions,\nbeliefs resulting from a reporting error, etc.). The Manual of\nReason\u2019s example (TS 72) is of the false pseudo-perceptual\njudgement \u201cThis is a piece of silver\u201d on seeing an\noyster-shell. I will discuss the epistemology of perception, inference\nand testimony in \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Here, I will\nexamine in more detail three types of cognition which, though very\nimportant within the Ny\u0101ya framework, are subsidiary to its\nepistemology. They are: memory, \u2018doubt\u2019 and\ntarka. (Where do dreams fit in the schema? TS 70 states that\nthey belong in the category of \u2018false\u2019 cognitions. This,\nhowever, is odd, since they are not the product of any of the four\npram\u0101\u1e47as misfiring. Neither are they memories or\nstates of doubt. According to Pra\u015bastap\u0101da, dreams are the\nresult of the free movement of the \u2018mind\u2019 when it is not\nconnected with the external sense-faculties, influenced by\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, \u2018unseen\u2019 forces.)\n5.2 Memory\n\nMemory is considered in the western tradition to be an important means\nby which an individual can justify her beliefs about the past. It is\nstriking then to note that the Ny\u0101ya at the outset separate\nmemory states from knowledge-yielding beliefs and deny to them the\nstatus of knowledge-hood. The Manual of Reason has the\nfollowing to say about memory:\n\n\nA memory state is one which results solely from a \u2018mental\ndisposition\u2019 (bh\u0101van\u0101) (TS 35).\n\nA \u2018mental disposition\u2019 is a quality of the soul which is\ncaused by a nonrecollective cognition and causes a memory cognition\n(TS 80).\n\nMemories are either \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, as the\noriginating cognition is true or false (TS 74).\n\n\nThe general theory is that an initial cognition, e.g. a perceptual\nexperience of an object, generates a dispositional mental state, which\nhas the capacity, when certain other causal factors are present, to\ntrigger an active memory of that object. (The whole process might be\nlikened to that of someone who, having learned to swim, has a\ndispositional capacity to swim, which they exercise on certain\noccasions.) The resultant memory state has the same content as the\noriginating perceptual experience, and can be said derivatively to be\n\u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, depending on whether the\noriginal perception was veridical or not. Memory, on this account is\nrepresented as an entirely infallible faculty: there is no mention of\nthe possibility of what is called \u201cfalse memory\u201d, i.e.\nhaving memories without any originating experience, or of\n\u201cfaulty memory\u201d, in which the content of the memory does\nnot exactly match that of the originating experience.\n\nGiven this account, in which memory is seen merely as reproducing a\npast knowing experience, there is perhaps a sense in which the memory\ndoes not itself count as knowledge, any more than an exact\nreproduction of a Picasso counts as a Picasso. The Naiy\u0101yikas\nstate that memories lack \u2018independence\u2019. The idea,\nperhaps, is this. In general we establish the veracity of an\nexperience by examining the way in which it was caused (my perception\nof the table is veridical, because my eyesight is good, the lighting\nis adequate, etc.). In the case of a memory, however, we must go via\nthe originating experience. Memory is conceived of as a mere surrogate\nfor the original experience, and its veracity is\n\u2018dependent\u2019 on that of the original. We might think,\nhowever, that memory in fact does more than merely reproduce the\noriginal experience. It may represent the experienced event as\nhappening in the past, and thus have a different content.\n5.3 Doubt (sa\u1e43\u015baya)\n\nThe concept of doubt has an important theoretical role in Ny\u0101ya,\nfor a state of doubt is claimed to be a necessary precondition for any\nphilosophical enquiry. Doubt is one of the sixteen topics listed under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.1, which determine the content of\nthe entire text. In particular, a doubt is the first step in a\nproperly formulated inference: is there a fire on the\nmountain?\u2014Yes, because there is smoke there. The Manual of\nReason gives a very precise definition of a doubt (TS 71): a\ncognition of two incompatible qualifiers in the same qualificand, for\nexample the cognition \u201cIs this (dimly perceived or distant\nobject) a person or a tree-stump?\u201d Schematically, then, a doubt\nis a cognition whose content is of the form \u201cx is\nF or not-F?\u201d.\n\nTwo points are worth noting. (i) Although doubts are classified as\nnon-true (apram\u0101) cognitions, they are not false. A\nfalse cognition is one whose content is \u201cx is\nF\u201d when in fact x is not F. (ii)\nDoubts are distinguished from other cognitions by virtue of having a\nspecial type of content, rather than by being propositional attitudes\nof a special kind. The Ny\u0101ya do not here say that we can take one\nof a series of attitudes towards the same proposition, believing,\ndisbelieving, doubting, etc. Yet if the only thing which distinguishes\na doubt is its having a content of the form specified in TS 71, then\nwhat differentiates the doubt that x is F from the\nbelief that x is both F and not-F?\nVardham\u0101na replies by drawing a distinction between actually\nhaving a contradictory belief and merely believing that one has a\ncontradictory belief. The former is supposedly impossible, the\nsupposedly contradictory belief that x is both F and\nnot-F is really a belief that I have a belief whose\nqualificand is x and whose qualifiers are F and\nnot-F. Since there are no genuine contradictory beliefs,\nthere are no beliefs with the same content as doubts.\n5.4 Tarka \u201cSuppositional Thinking\u201d\n\nThe term \u2018tarka\u2019 is often used loosely in the\nsense of hypothetical or reductio-ad-absurdum reasoning, but The\nManual of Reason gives it a much more precise and technical\nsense:\n\nTarka is the \u2018ascription\u2019 (\u0101ropa)\nof the \u2018pervader\u2019 (vy\u0101paka) by the\nascription of the \u2018pervaded\u2019 (vy\u0101pya). For\nexample, \u2018if there is no fire, then there is no smoke\u2019(TS\n73).\n\n\nThe terms in this definition require explanation. The technical sense\nof \u2018ascription\u2019 (\u0101ropa) is\n\u2018counterfactual or suppositional cognition\u2019\n(\u0101h\u0101ry\u0101ropa), defined as a cognition whose\nqualifier is an property the opposite of which is known to reside in\nthe qualificand. In other words, it is a counterfactual assumption.\n\u2018Pervader\u2019 and \u2018pervaded\u2019 are notions taken\nfrom the Ny\u0101ya theory of inference. When we say that wherever\nthere is smoke, there is fire, this can be re-expressed as that fire\npervades smoke, i.e. that the property of being a\nsmoke-possessing-thing has a narrower extension than the property of\nbeing a fire-possessing-thing. So here, fire is the pervader and smoke\nis the pervaded. Thus, tarka consists in a cognition of\nsmoke\u2019s absence given the counterfactual assumption that fire is\nabsent. It is the cognition of a conditional \u201cif p then\nq\u201d, or \u201cwere p to be true then\nq would be true\u201d, assuming that\n\u2018p\u2019 is false.\n\nOne main function of tarka is said to be the elimination of\ndoubt. Suppose one has the doubt \u201cIs x\nF?\u201d. One might then judge \u201cif x is not\nF then x is not G\u201d, and if one also\nknows that x is G, it will follow that x is\nF. The Naiy\u0101yikas recognise this function but deny\nnevertheless that tarka is a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a). Their reason, it seems, is that there\nis a distinction between citing positive empirical evidence for a\nthesis and merely eliminating the contrary possibility by a priori\nmethods. This is reflected, perhaps, in the fact that no example is\ncited in arguments based on tarka to buttress the inference.\nThe Manual of Reason, it seems, goes even further and denies\nthat the counterfactual conditional is a true cognition, which\nimplies, since they are not false either, that counterfactual\nconditionals do not have a truth-value.\n\nUdayana claims that tarka is of five types, namely\n\u2018self-dependence\u2019 (\u0101tm\u0101\u015braya),\n\u2018mutual dependence\u2019 (anyony\u0101\u015braya),\n\u2018circle\u2019 (cakraka), \u2018infinite\nregress\u2019 (anavasth\u0101), and \u2018having an\nundesirable consequence\u2019 or reductio-ad-absurdum\n(ani\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101prasa\u1e45ga). These are basically\nself-explanatory \u2013 the fifth,\n\u2018prasa\u1e45ga\u2019 is the one used to great effect\nby N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and other M\u0101dhyamika Buddhists. Other\nauthors give slightly different lists (see S. Bagchi 1953 for\ndetails).\n6. Causation and the Causal Theory of Knowledge\n6.1 Overview of Causation\n\nThe study of causation is an important part of Indian philosophical\nthought. One reason for this is the early interest in cosmological\nspeculation: \u201cWe should remember that philosophic activity in\nIndia arose out of the cosmogonic speculations of the Vedas and the\nUpani\u1e63ads. The all-important business of philosophy was to\nattempt to discover some simple, unitary cause for the origin of this\ncomplex universe\u201d (Matilal 1985: 287). Another reason is that\nIndian linguistics (especially the P\u0101\u1e47inian system of\n\u2018k\u0101rakas\u2019 or relations between verb and\nnoun, which greatly influenced Ny\u0101ya,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Buddhist thinkers) is based on an\nunderlying causal model, in which the verb in a sentence designates an\nevent, for the production of which each such object as is designated\nby a noun has a particular causal role. This same model informed and\ninfluenced Indian epistemology, and led to the development of the\ntheory of \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2019, the causal means\nor processes leading to an epistemically accredited awareness-event\n(pram\u0101). In the Ny\u0101ya tradition, four such\npram\u0101\u1e47as are recognised: perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\n\u2018analogical identification\u2019 or \u2018comparison\u2019\n(upam\u0101na) and testimony (\u015babda). The\naccounts given of each of these employ an extremely causalistic idiom,\ntypical questions being \u2018what causes a perceptual\nexperience?\u2019, \u2018what are the distinguishing causal factors\nof true and false perceptual experiences?\u2019, \u2018under what\nconditions does knowledge of the premises of an argument cause\nknowledge of the conclusion?\u2019, etc.\n\nThe choice of examples undoubtedly influences one\u2019s causal\ntheory. The Naiy\u0101yikas almost invariably illustrate their\ndiscussions with one of the following three examples: (i) The\npotter-pot example. The effect is the finished pot. Some of its\ncauses are the pot-halves (which the potter joins to form the pot),\nthe potter, his wheel and stick, the contact between each of the\npot-halves, and between them and the stick, etc. (ii) The\nthread-cloth example. Here the effect is the piece of cloth.\nAmong its causes are the threads from which it is woven, the weaver,\nthe shuttle, the loom, various contacts, etc. (iii) The axe-tree\nexample. The effect, i.e. the felling of the tree, is caused by\nthe axe, its contact with the tree, the axeman, etc. Some of the\nquestions we would like to ask here are these. Can all instances of\ncausation be fitted into the general pattern illustrated by these\nexamples (e.g. is there always an \u2018agent\u2019)? Do the\nNaiy\u0101yikas have an adequate account of causation even for these\nexamples (i.e. can they distinguish between those factors which are,\nand those factors which are not, causes of the effect)? Can both\nobjects and events be causes? Are causal relations singular or based\non repeatable regularities? Attempts to answer such questions as these\nled to increasingly sophisticated accounts of causation as the\nNy\u0101ya school evolved.\n6.2 The Three Types of Cause\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas traditionally held that, within\nthe total collection (s\u0101magr\u012b) of causal factors\nleading to an event, there are three distinguishable types of cause,\nnamely \u2018substrate\u2019 or \u2018inherence\u2019 causes\n(samavayi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a), \u2018non-substrate\u2019 or\n\u2018non-inherence\u2019 causes\n(a-samavayi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a), and\n\u2018instrumental\u2019 causes\n(nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a). This classification is repeated\nby The Manual of Reason (TS 43). A substrate cause is a\nsubstance in which the effect inheres. The substrate cause of a pot\nwould be the pot-halves; of a cloth, the threads. This is because the\nNy\u0101ya say that a whole inheres in its parts, and, so, if the\neffect (e.g. the pot) is a whole, its substrate causes are the parts\nin which it inheres. If the effect is an object\u2019s coming to have\na new property (e.g. the tree\u2019s being felled), the substrate\ncause is the object (the tree). Note that, in spite of a certain\nsimilarity, the notion of a substrate cause is not the same as\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cmaterial\u201d cause, for (i) the parts of\nan object are not necessarily identical with the material from which\nit is composed, and (ii) even an immaterial substance can be a\nsubstrate cause, for example the soul, which is the substrate cause of\nepistemic events.\n\nAll other causal factors are either \u2018non-substrate\u2019 causes\nor \u2018instrumental\u2019 causes. A non-substrate cause is one\nwhich inheres in the substrate cause. Thus, though not being the\nsubstrate, it is closely connected with it. The conjunction of threads\nis said to be a non-substrate cause of a piece of cloth. Another\nexample is often cited. The non-substrate cause of the colour of a\npiece of cloth is the colour of the threads (which colour inheres in\nthe threads, in which inheres the effect, the colour of the cloth).\nAny other causal factor is called an instrumental cause, for example,\nthe weaver\u2019s shuttle or the weaver herself. Why did the\nNaiy\u0101yikas distinguish between non-substrate causes and the\nremainder? Perhaps it was an attempt to differentiate between those\ncauses which must continue to exist for the effect to exist, and those\nwhich need not. If the threads were to lose their colour, then the\ncloth would lose its, and if the threads were to become disjoint, the\ncloth would cease to exist altogether. If, however, the weaver dies,\nhaving already woven the cloth, or if the shuttle is subsequently\ndestroyed, it will not affect the continued existence of the\neffect.\n\nIt does not follow from these definitions that anything which inheres\nin the substrate is a non-substrate cause, or that anything which does\nnot is an instrumental cause. In other words, we still need to define\n\u201cbeing a cause\u201d. First, however, two more types of causal\nfactor are distinguished by the Ny\u0101ya. These are the\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause (kara\u1e47a) and\nthe \u2018operating condition\u2019 (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) We\noften speak of the cause of an effect, and in doing so pick\nout one factor from the total collection of causal factors as being\nparticularly salient or important in bringing about the effect.\nIntuitively, the idea is that, even if we have the substrate cause\n(the pot-halves), the non-substrate cause (the contact between the\nhalves), and even some of the instrumental causes (the potter, etc.),\nwe will not get the effect (the pot) unless the potter acts or\n\u2018operates\u2019 to bring it about. In a sense, then, it is the\npotter\u2019s actually using his stick which is the cause of\nthe pot. The Naiy\u0101yikas try to capture this idea by saying that\none of the instrumental causes is the \u2018special\u2019\n(as\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a) cause of the effect, and they\ncall it the \u2018kara\u1e47a\u2019. This notion is\nparticularly important to the Ny\u0101ya epistemology (see below).\nWhat constitutes the \u2018special\u2019 nature of this cause? The\nNavya-ny\u0101ya (cf. TS 54) answer is as follows. They introduce\nfirst the notion of an \u2018operative condition\u2019\n(vy\u0101p\u0101ra), defined as that cause which immediately\nprecedes the effect. For example, the operative condition for a pot is\nthe conjunction of the pot-halves; for the felling of a tree, it is\nthe final contact between axe and tree before the tree falls. The\n\u2018special\u2019 cause is defined as that factor which\n\u2018brings about\u2019 this operative condition. In other words,\nit is the factor whose operation directly brings about the effect. In\nthe examples, it would be the axe or the potter\u2019s stick. These\nobjects are, for the Ny\u0101ya, the true instruments by means of\nwhich the effect is produced.\n6.3 What is a Cause?\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas build up in this way a model of causation, in\nwhich different causal factors have different types of causal role.\nThe model reflects (or is reflected in) the Indian grammatical\nanalysis of causal statements, such as \u201cThe potter throws a pot\nwith her stick\u201d, \u201cThe lumberjack fells a tree with her\naxe\u201d, in which one distinguishes, apart from the verb\ndesignating the event, an agent (kart\u1e5b), object\n(karman), instrument (kara\u1e47a), and so on. We\ndo not yet know, however, how to distinguish between causes and\nnon-causes. The Manual of Reason (TS 41) provides the\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya answer. Given two entities, c and\ne,\n\nc is a causal factor for e iff\n\nc exists before e,\nc exists \u2018regularly\u2019\n(niyata) with e, and\nc is \u2018relevant\u2019\n(ananyath\u0101siddha) to e.\n\n\n\nThe first clause is to prevent self-causation. The import of the\nsecond condition is that entities similar to c must always\nexist with entities similar to e. There must be an invariable\nor constant conjunction between c-type entities and\ne-type entities. This rules out objects which just happen to\nbe there, such as, to give the Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 example, a\ndonkey happening to wander past the pottery just as the potter goes to\nwork. This feature of the account, the insistence that a causal\nrelation instantiates a regularity, resembles a Humean account of\ncausation. The Naiy\u0101yika, however, recognised the possibility of\n\u2018accidental\u2019, non-causal regularities, such as day always\npreceding night, or (the example given by The Manual of\nReason), the colour of the thread always preceding the cloth.\nAlthough the occurrence of a cloth is invariably preceded, not just by\nthreads, but by the presence of thread-colour as well, we would not\nwant to say that thread-colour is a cause of cloth. The third clause\nis their attempt to eliminate such accidental regularities. The same\nclause is supposed to stop the cause of a cause (e.g. the\npotter\u2019s parents) from being a cause. Its meaning, however, is\nnot quite clear. Literally, it states that a cause must be \u2018not\nestablished otherwise\u2019. Kalidas Bhattacharya says that \u201can\ninvariable antecedent is irrelevant if knowledge of it is not required\nfor any anticipative knowledge of the origination of the effect\u201d\n(see Potter 1977: 67). Matilal says that an antecedent is irrelevant\nif \u201cit is possible to find a reasonable explanation of its\nappearance\u201d (1985: 290). The Manual of Reason states\nthat an antecedent is irrelevant if its antecedence is only\nestablished along with some other entity. We know that thread-colour\nprecedes cloth only because we know that it occurs with the thread\n(which we know to precede cloth); hence the thread-colour is\nirrelevant in this sense. This highlights an asymmetry between the two\nregularities, the threadcolour-cloth regularity and the thread-cloth\nregularity. For while we can establish the latter directly by\nobserving correlations between thread and cloth, we establish the\nformer by observing the correlation between threadcolour and thread.\nThus the former supposedly depends on the latter but not vice versa.\nIt is not clear, however, that the dependence does not run the other\nway too. In any case, in using this criterion to block transitivity,\nthe Naiy\u0101yikas seem to seeking a definition not of causality per\nse (which most regard as a transitive relation), but rather an\nepistemic notion of \u2018causal explanation\u2019 or \u2018causal\nsalience\u2019.\n6.4 Causation and Knowledge\n\nCognitions that are not memories are classified under two headings:\ntrue and false. If we can find factors invariably preceding\ntrue cognitions, then we will have the beginnings of a causal\ntheory of knowledge. We will be able to say that a cognition is a\nknowledge-episode iff it is (i) true and (ii) preceded by a causal\nfactor which invariably precedes true cognitions (i.e. its truth will\nnot be an accident). The Ny\u0101ya (TS 39) claim to find four, and\nonly four, invariable correlations: perception, inference, comparison,\nand testimony. To each they apply the model of causation outlined\nabove. In particular, they isolate, in each case, a\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause (kara\u1e47a), to\nwhich they give the name \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019. In\nthe case of perception, for example, it is the senses. Note that an\ninvariable correlation between two entities, in the sense defined\nabove, does not entail that whenever the first is present, so is the\nsecond\u2014the potter is invariably connected with a pot, but only\ncauses a pot when he is actually \u2018operating\u2019. Similarly, a\npram\u0101\u1e47a, e.g. the eyes, only causes a true\ncognition when it is actually operating. In other words, the\npram\u0101\u1e47a is a necessary but not a sufficient cause\nfor true cognitions. To get a sufficient cause, the Ny\u0101ya (TSD 69\niii) says:\n\nThe causal condition that is \u2018special\u2019 to true cognition\nis called a \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 [an epistemic\nexcellence]; the causal condition that is \u2018special\u2019 to\nfalse cognition is called \u2018do\u1e63a\u2019 [an\nepistemic defect]. In the perceptual case, the gu\u1e47a [of\na true cognition \u2018x is F\u2019] is the\nsensory connection with an object [x] possessing a property\n[F], etc.\n\n\nThis is, in effect, the operative condition for true perceptual\ncognitions. Thus, the occurrence of all the usual factors (substrate\ncauses, non-substrate causes, general instrumental causes, etc.)\ntogether with an epistemic excellence (gu\u1e47a) is a\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition for the occurrence of a true\ncognition (see also Philips and Tatacharya 2003).\n7. Perception, Concepts and Sense-Object Relations\n\nNoticing something coiled up in the corner of the room, I perceive it\nto be a piece of rope. Looking out of the window, I see that the sky\nis blue and see also, perhaps, the blueness of the sky. I see too that\nthe air is cold, and that there is nobody on the street. What do all\nthese experiences have in common, in virtue of which they are all acts\nof perception? The Manual of Reason (TS 46) gives the\nclassical Ny\u0101ya answer:\n\nPrinciple 1: In each case of perceptual experience,\nthe experience has as its special instrumental cause a\n\u2018connection\u2019 (sannikar\u1e63a) between the\nobject perceived and the perceiver\u2019s sense-faculty.\n\n\nAll seeings are the product of a sensory connection (of a type to be\nspecified) with the thing seen. This basic idea must be embellished in\ntwo ways before it is can serve as a proper a theory of perception:\n(i) some account must be given of the fact that, in all the cases\ncited above, the content of perception is semantically structured\n(e.g. that the thing in the corner is a piece of rope), for otherwise\nperceptual experiences would not be capable of being true, and hence\nfail to qualify as knowledge-episodes; (ii) an account must be given\nof the type of \u2018connection\u2019 involved here. Only then can\nwe evaluate the merits of the Ny\u0101ya theory.\n7.1 \u2018Qualificative Perception\u2019 and the Role of Concepts\n\nA structured perception, of an object a as having a certain property\nf (e.g. seeing the thing in the corner as being a piece of\nrope), is called by the Naiy\u0101yikas \u2018qualificative\u2019\n(savikalpaka = saprak\u0101raka), for it a perception of an\nobject, the \u2018qualificand\u2019 (vi\u015be\u1e63ya) as\nhaving a certain feature or \u2018qualifier\u2019\n(prak\u0101ra; vise\u1e63a\u1e47a) (cf. TS 47). It\nis alleged by the Naiy\u0101yikas that any piece of perceptual\nknowledge must be of this form, and further that most cases\nin which we claim just to be seeing an object (e.g. \u201cI see the\ncar\u201d) are really cases of seeing something as a car. In a\n\u2018qualificative\u2019 perception, it is the qualificand which is\nin sensory connection with the perceiver. How then does the qualifier\nenter the picture? The Ny\u0101ya claim that:\n\nPrinciple 2: In every case of perception, the\nqualifier is a previously perceived entity (substance, quality, motion\nor universal) which is recalled by the perceiver and\n\u2018superimposed\u2019 upon the qualificand.\n\n\nThe intuitive idea is that the qualifying feature is a concept,\nempirically acquired by the perceiver, and now used to categorise the\nobject perceived. To see that the passing animal is a horse, one must\nfirst possess the concept horse, by means of previous\nacquaintance with the type. (Use of the term \u2018concept\u2019\nhere does not imply that the features are in any sense\nsubjective\u2014for the Ny\u0101ya they are objective entities or\nconstructions out of objective entities). The Ny\u0101ya thus use\ntheir theory of memory (initial experience causing dispositional trace\ncausing memory event) as a theory of concept-possession.\n\nPrinciple 2 has a number of consequences:\n\nIf every case of seeing an object a as f is\npreceded by a prior perception of f, and if that prior\nperception were itself of f as qualified by some qualifier\ng, we would get an infinite regress. The Ny\u0101ya (cf. TS\n47) therefore state that, in addition to qualificative perceptions,\nthere are also \u2018non-qualificative\u2019 (nirvikalpaka =\nni\u1e63prak\u0101raka) perceptual experiences. In such\nexperiences, on sees both the object and its qualifier, but not as\nbeing qualified by the qualifier.\nTo illustrate the general theory, suppose I perceive for the first\ntime a vase having a particular shade of blue which I have never\nbefore seen. The theory states that, prior to seeing the vase as being\nqualified by that shade, I first see the vase, together with (but not\nqualified by) the shade, and then, recalling that shade, impose it\nupon the vase.\nPerceptual illusions, hallucinations, etc., are all explained as\ncases in which a wrong feature is recalled from memory (or the concept\nbank). Suppose I misperceive the coiled object in the corner as being\na snake. The account given by the Ny\u0101ya is that I recall and\nsuperimpose the feature snakehood, on the basis presumably of its\nclose similarity with the true feature ropehood. Similarly, if I\nhallucinate a dagger, the account entails that I am superimposing the\nmemory of some previously encountered dagger upon the region of space\nin front of me (there must be some qualificand, by Principle\n1). This is called the \u2018mislocation\u2019\n(anyath\u0101khy\u0101ti) theory of perceptual error. Note\nthat, if all error is a product of qualifier-mislocation, then no\nerror is possible with respect to the qualificand with which one is in\nsensory connection. Note too that the Ny\u0101ya make no appeal to\n\u2018images\u2019, \u2018ideas\u2019 or any other subjective\ncontent to explain illusion\u2014it is an externalist account of\nerror. This shows that the so-called argument from illusion, from the\nphenomenal indistinguishability of veridical and non-veridical\nperceptual experiences to their having a shared subjective content, is\nfalse. It is not clear, however, that one can always find a suitable\nqualificand (is a region of space really perceived in a\nhallucination?) or a suitable qualifier (e.g. when one sees a stick as\nbent, because partially submerged in water, where does the feature\n\u2018being bent thus\u2019 come from?\u2014the Ny\u0101ya actually\nclaim that it is an objective feature causally produced by the act of\nperceiving!)\nThis theory allows the Ny\u0101ya to say that locutions like\n\u201cI see (visually) that the air is cold\u201d or \u201cI see\nthat the mango is sweet\u201d, in which the qualifier, though\nperceptible is not a visible property, are genuine cases of\nperception. They classify them as a type of\n\u2018extra-ordinary\u2019 perception, called\nj\u00f1\u0101na-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101-praty\u0101satti.\n(The other types of extra-ordinary perception sometimes admitted are\n\u2018s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u2019, in which\nall the bearers of a property are perceived by perceiving the\nproperty, and yogic perception.)\nThe Ny\u0101ya state that experience amounts to a\nknowledge-episode when and only when it is true, i.e. when the\nqualifier actually qualifies the qualificand. The Manual of\nReason (TS 69 iii) says that the gu\u1e47a or special\ncausal factor for perceptual knowledge when the qualifier imposed by\nthe perceiver onto the sensorily connected qualificand is actually\npresent in the qualificand. There may, however, be scope for\nGettier-style counter-examples to this definition.\n\n7.2 Types of Sense-Object Relation\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 48) reports the standard Ny\u0101ya\nview, which is due to Uddyotakara, that there are exactly six types of\nsense-object relation which ground perceptual experiences:\n\nContact or conjunction (sa\u1e43yoga). Ordinary\nperceptions, e.g. of a pot. If by \u2018contact\u2019 we understand\nsome sort of causal relation, then the Ny\u0101ya can be said to have\na causal theory of perception. However, they may mean that the eye is\nin contact with the object in some more literal sense.\nInherence-in-the-conjoined\n(sa\u1e43yukta-samav\u0101ya). We noted above that, in\n\u2018non-qualificative\u2019 perception, one sees the object and\nits feature together. The relation between the feature and the\nperceiver is an indirect one\u2014the feature inheres in the object,\nwith which the perceiver is in contact.\nInherence-in-the-inherent-in-the-conjoined\n(sa\u1e43yukta-samaveta-samav\u0101ya). If the feature in\n(2) is a quality (gu\u1e47a), e.g. a particular shade of\nblue, then inhering in it is a universal, blueness, which can itself\napparently be perceived.\nInherence (samav\u0101ya). The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas have a rather strange doctrine, that\neach sense-faculty is made out of the type of substance with which it\nis particularly associated. The auditory faculty is thus made out of\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, and, as sounds inhere in\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, the relation between the hearer and the\nsound is inherence.\nInherence-in-the-inherent (samaveta-samav\u0101ya). By\nthis indirect relation, the hearer is related to properties such as\nsound-hood inhering in sound.\nQualifier-qualificand relation\n(vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47a-vi\u015be\u1e63ya-bh\u0101va).\nThis is an important one. The Ny\u0101ya believe that absences are\n\u2018real\u2019 objects, e.g. the absence of an elephant in the\nroom now, and that they can be perceived. Absences are said to qualify\ntheir substrata, and are perceived indirectly, by the perceiver seeing\nthe substratum. The Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti argued that this is\nreally an inference from non-apprehension (anupalabdhi-hetu)\nrunning thus: \u201cI perceive the walls of the room; if there were an\nelephant, I would not see it, and my perceptual faculties are working\nnormally; therefore, there is no elephant\u201d.\n\n7.3 Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Criticisms and New Definition\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba criticises Principle 1 on three grounds: (a) it\nentails that every awareness is perceptual since every awareness is\nproduced by the instrumentality of the \u2018inner\u2019 sense\nfaculty or manas; (b) it fails to include divine perception,\nwhich involves no sensory connection; and (c) there is no one type of\nsensory connection, nor anything obviously in common to the ad hoc\nlist of six types. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba therefore offers a new\ndefinition:\n\nPrinciple 3: A perceptual experience is a cognition\nwhich has no other non-mnemonic cognition as its \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause (kara\u1e47a).\n\n\nTwo objections to this definition are countered. Objection 1: Since\nevery qualificative cognition is produced by a prior awareness of the\nqualifier, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The awareness of\nthe qualifier is merely an auxiliary causal factor, the\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause is a sense-object contact.\nObjection 2: Since recognition, which is a type of perception, does\nhave the prior awareness of the qualifier as its \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The\n\u2018special\u2019 causal factor is the memory of the qualifier\ntriggered by the dispositional trace produced by the prior awareness,\nnot the prior awareness itself.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s definition has the virtue of capturing the\nsense in which perceptual experience is more \u2018immediate\u2019\nthan other types of experience, and is also applicable both to human\nand to divine perception. Restricted to human perception, it turns\ninto the previous definition (Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says that the\n\u2018inner\u2019 sense should not be regarded as perceptual after\nall).\n8. Logical Theory and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Analysis of Inferential Warrant (vy\u0101pti)\n8.1 Overview of Logical Theory\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i is\ndivided into four parts, one for each of the four knowledge-sources or\npram\u0101\u1e47as recognised by the Ny\u0101ya school. The\npost-Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba scholars focused more and more exclusively on\nthe second part, concerning inference, and wrote increasingly detailed\ncommentaries on a comparatively small portion of the book, namely the\npart where Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba examines the relation between\ninferential sign and property-to-be-inferred, which is called the\nvy\u0101pti, \u2018pervasion\u2019 or\n\u2018inference-warranting\u2019 relation (Ingalls 1951, Goekoop\n1977, Wada 2007). Even today, in a traditional Indian education, study\nof these sub-commentaries on various subsections of the\nvy\u0101pti section of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba forms an essential\npart of the curriculum.\n\nThe general structure of a properly formulated Ny\u0101ya inference\nhas three components: thesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the \u2018locus\u2019 (pak\u1e63a) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (s\u0101dhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred. Thus every Ny\u0101ya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it has\nH; e.g. d. For example, \u201cThe mountain ( =\np) has fire (= S), because it has smoke ( =\nH); e.g. the kitchen ( = d)\u201d. A sound argument must\nfulfil at least three criteria: (i) the reason property must be\nuncontroversially present in the locus; (ii) the reason property and\nthe inferred property must be appropriately related, roughly such that\nwherever the reason is present, so is the inferred property; (iii) the\nexample must be an uncontroversial place where both the reason\nproperty and the inferred property are present.\n\nCertain topics concerning this account are addressed in The Manual\nof Reason and other Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts. Among them are: the\nconditions under which inference can take place, and the conditions\nunder which the result is a knowledge-episode (TS 49, 54); the correct\naccount of the inference-warranting relation, between the inferential\nsign and the property-to-be-inferred, called the\n\u2018pervasion\u2019 or \u2018vy\u0101pti\u2019 relation\n(TS 50); the distinction between inference and demonstration\n(sv\u0101rtha- and par\u0101rtha- inference) (TS 52,\n53); the three-fold classification of inference types, those which are\n\u2018universally positive\u2019 (keval\u0101nvayin), those\nwhich are \u2018universally negative\u2019\n(kevala-vyatirekin), and those which are combined positive\nand negative (anvaya-vyatirekin) (TS 55); the types of\ninferential fallacy (hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa) (TS\n57\u201364).\n\nI will discuss mainly the definition of the \u2018pervasion\u2019\nrelation. First, however, a brief note on how the causal model of\nknowledge is applied to inference. The \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause (kara\u1e47a) of an inferential cognition\nis said to be the inferrer\u2019s knowledge of the relevant pervasion\nrelation. The \u2018operative condition\u2019\n(vy\u0101p\u0101ra) is said to be an awareness that the locus\nof inference (p) possesses such an inferential sign\n(h) as is pervaded by the property inferred (s).\nThis is, in effect, an awareness which combines the two premises of\nthe argument together immediately prior to the conclusion being\nderived, and is called the \u2018par\u0101mar\u015ba\u2019\nor \u2018consideration\u2019. The \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019\nor \u2018causal factor responsible for the truth\u2019 of the\ninferential cognition is the condition that this\n\u2018consideration\u2019 be true, i.e. that the locus does in fact\npossess such a sign as is pervaded by the inferred property. Another\nauxiliary causal factor is that the inferrer must either not yet\nalready know the conclusion or else must have a particular desire to\ninfer (i.e. given, knowledge of the premises, the inference would\nnormally take place mechanically, but if the conclusion is already\nknown e.g. perceptually, then the inferrer has to have a special wish\nto re-establish it inferentially). This condition is known as\n\u2018pak\u1e63a\u1e6d\u0101\u2019, and should not to be\nconfused with \u2018pak\u1e63adharmat\u0101\u2019, which\nis the name of condition (i) above.\n8.2 Definitions of the Pervasion (vy\u0101pti) Relation\n\nVy\u0101pti or pervasion, is that relation between the\ninferential sign (hetu) and the inferred property\n(s\u0101dhya), which legitimises the inference. It would\ntypically be expressed by a sentence such as \u201cwherever there is\nsmoke there is fire\u201d, or \u201cwhatever exists is\ntransitory\u201d. Knowledge of this relation, according to the\nNy\u0101ya, is the instrumental cause in the inferential\nprocess\u2014it is that relation knowledge of which, when combined\nwith observation of the inferential sign, will permit us to make a\nsound or knowledge-yielding inference. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba therefore\nattaches great importance to the precise definition of this relation.\nHe notes as many as twenty-one definitions all of which he rejects for\nsome reason or other, and then he goes on to give seven further\nformulations, each of which he considers acceptable. Of the\ndefinitions he rejects, the first five came to be known as the\n\u2018vy\u0101pti-pa\u00f1caka\u2019, and inspired a huge\nliterature both among the Sanskrit commentators and their modern\ninterpreters. These definitions are traceable to the earlier Buddhist\nand Ny\u0101ya literature. Two more rejected definitions, known as the\n\u2018Lion and Tiger\u2019 definitions, are apparently due to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Navya-Ny\u0101ya predecessors (Wada 2007,\nch. 5). The definition Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba finally accepts is called\nhis \u2018siddh\u0101nta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u2019.\n8.3 The \u2018No Counter-Example\u2019 Definition\n\nThe five definitions which make up Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\n\u2018vy\u0101pti-pa\u00f1caka\u2019 are all varieties of\nwhat we might dub the \u2018no counter-example\u2019 definition of\nthe pervasion relation. This states that the inferred property\nS pervades the reason property H just in case there\nis no place/entity where H is located but S is\nabsent. Formally:\n\nV1\nPervades (S, H) iff\n    \u00ac(\u2203x)(Hx &\n    S\u2032x).\n\n\nwhere S\u2032 is used to denote the complement of\nS. This definition is traceable both to the early Ny\u0101ya\nnotion of a \u2018deviating\u2019 pseudo-reason (i.e. one which\noccurs somewhere where the inferable property S is absent),\nand to Di\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s \u2018triple-condition\u2019\ntheory of the inferential sign, his third condition being that H must\nnot be located in any \u201cdisagreeing case\u201d (cf.\n\u2018vipak\u1e63a\u2019), i.e. a place where S\nis absent. In either case, the intuition is that a relation expressed\nby \u201cwhere there is smoke there is fire\u201d obtains just in\ncase there is no place where fire is absent but smoke is present, i.e.\nno counter-example. The first definition which Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nconsiders is of just this form. It is that S pervades\nH iff H has \u201cnon-occurrence in the loci of\nabsence of S\u201d\n(s\u0101dhy\u0101bh\u0101vavad-av\u1e5bttitvam), i.e.\nV1.\n\nWhy is this plausible-seeming interpretation of the notion of\npervasion rejected in Navya-Ny\u0101ya? There are two reasons:\n\nThe Problem of Partially Locatable Properties. The first\nproblem with the \u2018no counter-example\u2019 definition depends\non the Navya-ny\u0101ya notion of partial location\n(avy\u0101pya-v\u1e5btti). A property is said to occur\nwholly or completely in an object if it occurs in every part of that\nobject. For example, the property of being golden occurs completely in\na piece of (pure) gold; the object is \u2018saturated\u2019\n(abhivy\u0101pya) by the property, just as sesame oil\nsaturates a sesame seed. Some properties, however, occur in some parts\nof the object but not others\u2014these are called \u201cpartially\nlocatable\u201d. For example, the property of being molten occurs at\nthe centre of the Earth but not at the periphery. Note that the same\nproperty can be wholly located in some loci and partially located in\nothers\u2014e.g. redness occurs wholly in a ruby but partially in a\nred snooker ball. The distinction concerns two modes of\nproperty-possession, not two types of property. An important point is\nthat, if a property is partially located in an object, then so is its\nnegation. The Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 standard example of a partially\nlocatable property, viz. \u201c\u2026is in contact with a\nmonkey\u201d (kapi-samyoga), illustrates the point. If the\nmonkey is sitting on a branch of a tree, then the following statements\nmay be true:\n\nThe tree is in-contact-with-the-monkey at time t,\nand\nThe tree is not-in-contact-with-the-monkey at time\nt,\n\n\n(2) being true because there are parts of the tree with which the\nmonkey is not in contact. Ny\u0101ya avoids the threatened violation\nof the law of non-contradiction by relativising the notion of\noccurrence. (1) is thus analysed as \u201cthe occurrence, of the\nproperty being-in-contact-with-the-monkey in the tree, is\ndelimited by (avacchinna) the branch\u201d. Since a different\ndelimitor appears in (2), there is no inconsistency between the two\nstatements.\n\nThe main effect of admitting partially located properties into the\nsystem is that it is no longer the case that a property, P,\nand its complement, P\u2032, are disjoint: they may now\nintersect. If the inferred property is partially located, then the\nclass of \u201cagreeing cases\u201d (sapak\u1e63as -\nplaces where the inferred property is present) and the class of\n\u201cdisagreeing cases\u201d (vipak\u1e63as\u2014places\nwhere the inferred property is absent) overlap rather than being\ndistinct classes. To put it another way, a property P should\nbe thought of as having both a \u201cpresence range\u201d\n(P+) and an \u201cabsence range\u201d (P\u2212),\nand the two may overlap. Consider now the standard inference\n\u201cThe mountain has fire, because it has smoke\u201d. Suppose we\nfind a place where smoke is present, and fire is both absent and also\npresent, e.g. the kitchen. Does this show the inference to be faulty?\nAccording to definition V1, it does, because the kitchen\nwill be a counter-example, a place where smoke is present and fire\nabsent. But this is wrong: since fire is also present there, it is not\na real counter-example to the rule \u201cwhere there is smoke there\nis fire\u201d. The upshot is that we must examine the \u201cpresence\nranges\u201d of the reason property and inferred properties, not\ntheir \u201cabsence ranges\u201d. A real counter-example to rule is\na case which is in the presence-range of the reason property but not\nin the presence range of the inferred property.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s second definition is designed to solve this\nproblem: H\u2019s \u201cnon-occurrence in the loci of\nabsence of S which are different from locus of\nS\u201d. In other words, a locus of absence of S\nwhich is also not a locus of S should not be a locus of\nH:\n\nV2\nPervades (S, H) iff\n      \u00ac(\u2203x)(Hx &\n      S\u2032x & \u00acSx).\n\n\nThe effect of the new clause is precisely to rule out the problem of\npartially locatable properties, by specifying more restrictively what\nconstitutes a counter-example.\n\nThe Problem of Universally Positive Inference. There are,\nclaim the Ny\u0101ya, patterns of legitimate inference in which the\nproperty inferred has as its extension the entire domain. Such\ninference are called \u2018keval\u0101nvayin\u2019 or\n\u2018universally positive\u2019 (cf. TS 55). The stock Ny\u0101ya\nexample is the inference \u201cThis is nameable, because it is\nknowable\u201d, nameability being regarded as a property of\neverything. Another example would be \u201cThis exists because it is\nproduced\u201d. If such an inference is sound, then its reason\nproperty and inferred property must exemplify the pervasion relation.\nAccording to the above definition, to say that nameability pervades\nknowability is to say that any locus of the property\nabsence-of-nameability is not a locus of knowability. The problem is\nthat, since nameability is a universal property,\nabsence-of-nameability is an uninstantiated (aprasiddha)\nproperty, and the Ny\u0101ya claim that such properties are\nontologically suspect. To put it another way, the statement \u201cany\nlocus of the property absence-of-nameability is not a locus of\nknowability\u201d includes a non-referring expression,\n\u201clocus-of-absence-of-nameability\u201d or \u201cunnameable\nthing\u201d, and hence is not truth-evaluable. The problem does not\narise for all uninstantiated properties, for some, e.g. being a\nsky-lotus, or being a square circle, can be shown to be constructs\nmade out of simpler instantiated properties. Thus, the statement\n\u201cThe square circle is circular\u201d can be taken not as\ncontaining a non-referring expression, but as meaning \u201cThe\ncircle is square and circular\u201d. However, \u2018unnameable\n(thing)\u2019 is not decomposable into two distinct properties this\nway.\n\nNone of the interpretations of the \u2018no counter-example\u2019\ndefinition considered by Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba can solve the problem of\nuniversally positive inferences, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba accordingly\nrejects them all. His own definition uses a trick to get round the\nproblem.\n8.4 Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Definition: the \u2018siddh\u0101nta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u2019\n\nThe Manual of Reason reproduces with slight simplification\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s new definition. It says that S and\nH are related by the pervasion relation just in case there is\ncollocation of H with S and S is not a\nproperty the absence of which is collocated with H\n(hetusam\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47\u0101tyant\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101pratiyogi-s\u0101dhyas\u0101m\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47yam\nvy\u0101pti\u1e25; TS 50). Almost the same formulation is found\nin other Navya-Ny\u0101ya texts, such as the\nSiddh\u0101nta-mukt\u0101vali. This definition is supposed to\nbe applicable even if the inferred property S is\n\u2018universally positive\u2019. The idea, roughly, is that if\nS pervades H then no property whose absence is\ncollocated with H can be identical to S. If we can\nfind an instance of a locus of smoke which is also a locus of the\nabsence of some property, coldness say, then coldness cannot be\nidentical with fieriness. That is:\n\nPervades (S, H) only if\n(\u2203x)(Hx &\nP\u2032x) \u2192 (P \u2260 S).\n\n\n(There is an implicit quantification over P here). What this\nsays is that there is no place where H is collocated with the\nabsence of S, but it does so without actually using the\npotentially non-referring phrase \u201cabsence of S\u201d, and it\nthereby avoids the problem of universally positive properties.\nHowever, although this condition is necessary for pervasion, it is not\nsufficient, for it is consistent with H (or S) being\nuninstantiated. So Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba insists too that H and\nS must be collocated:\n\n \nPervades (S, H) iff\n  \ni.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      P\u2032x) \u2192 (P \u2260 S),\n      and\nii.\n\u2203x (Hx & Sx).\n\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s trick implicitly trades on the theorem\n\u201cA \u2192 B \u2261 \u00ac (A &\n\u00ac B)\u201d. Thus clause (i) is virtually equivalent to\nV1. This shows too that we do not yet have a definition\nwhich can deal with the partially locatable properties, for which we\nneed something more like V2. Hence\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s final definition is:\n\nV3\nPervades (S, H) iff\n  \ni.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      P\u2032x & \u00acPx) \u2192\n      (P \u2260 S), and\nii.\n\u2203x (Hx &\n      Sx).\n\n\n\nThis definition of pervasion is able to handle both universally\npositive properties and partially located properties appearing as\ninferred property.\n\nOne may wonder why it is that, since a pervasion relation is of the\nform \u201call Hs are S\u201d, the Naiy\u0101yikas\ndid not simply use the notion of universal quantification in their\ndefinitions. The answer, perhaps, is that they were in fact trying to\ndefine this notion, and to do so only in terms of certain other\nnotions which they took to be primitive, especially the notion of\nco-location and absence. If this is correct, however, then we must\nshow how to reconstruct the definition without its implicit\nquantification over a property P (cf. Goekoop 1967).\n9. Meaning, Understanding and Testimony\n9.1 The Language Processing Mechanism\n\nJust as perception and inference are described, in the\npram\u0101\u1e47a system, as knowledge-yielding faculties,\nso too is language. This leads the Ny\u0101ya to formulate a\ndescription of the mechanism by which a competent language-user is\nable to decode noise-utterances and derive language-based knowledge.\nThe description The Manual of Reason gives of this\n\u2018language processing mechanism\u2019 is as follows (TS 67, 68).\nThe input to the process is the hearer\u2019s auditory perception of\na spoken utterance qua uninterpreted noise, and this is identified as\nthe \u2018special\u2019 instrument cause (kara\u1e47a).\nFor example, hearing the noise-string\n\n[*]\n\u201cThe\u201d \u201ccat\u201d \u201cis\u201d\n      \u201con\u201d \u201cthe\u201d \u201cmat\u201d.\n\n\nThe \u2018operative condition\u2019 (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) is\nthe hearer\u2019s (tacit) knowledge of the meaning\n(\u015bakti-j\u00f1\u0101na) of each of the words in the\nutterance. This is what marks off a person who understands the\nlanguage in question from one who does not (but who may, nevertheless\nhear the words spoken, without having the capacity to interpret them).\nFor example, knowledge that\n\n[M1]\n\u201cthe cat\u201d means the cat,\n[M2]\n\u201cthe mat\u201d means the mat, and\n[M3]\n\u201cis on\u201d means the substratum-superstratum relation.\n\n\nThe output of the process, i.e. the effect of the combined causal\nfactors, is the hearer\u2019s forming a belief, for example belief\nthat\n\n[P]\nThe cat is on the mat.\n\n\nJust as, in the case of perception, a number of auxiliary causal\nfactors, such as there being adequate lighting, the perceiver\u2019s\nsense-faculty being in good condition, the perceiver paying attention,\netc., so here too. Ny\u0101ya isolates four such factors for special\nattention, namely: spatio-temporal \u2018contiguity\u2019\n(sannidhi) of the uttered words; the speaker\u2019s\nintention (t\u0101tparya); \u2018syntactic expectancy\u2019\n(\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101); and \u2018semantic\nfitness\u2019 (yogyat\u0101) (cf. TS 67). The first is\nself-explanatory: if the words in the utterance are uttered one at a\ntime over a long period of time, or mixed in with the words of a\ndistinct utterance, it will be impossible form a proper auditory\nperception of the utterance. The second, \u2018speaker\u2019s\nintention\u2019 is appealed to when the sentence contains an\nambiguous word\u2014disambiguation proceeds via consideration of the\nspeaker\u2019s intended meaning. The Manual of Reason\ndefines \u2018syntactic expectancy\u2019 as \u2018the inability of\none word to produce, without another word, an awareness of the\nrelation between them\u2019, and it cites, as an example of an\nutterance which fails to possess such expectancy, the sentence\n\u201chorse man elephant\u201d. Clearly the idea is at least that\nthe utterance must be grammatically correct. More than that, there is\na suggestion that it is in virtue of the syntactical rules that the\nunarticulated semantic relations between the words are expressed. What\nmakes it the case that someone who understands the utterance\n\u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d grasps a united proposition, and\nnot just a list of items [the cat, the on-relation, the mat]? The idea\nhere, perhaps, is that (knowledge of) the syntactical rules generates\nan awareness of the connecting relations between each of these\nitems.\n\n\u2018Semantic fitness\u2019 (yogyat\u0101) is an\nintriguing concept. The Manual of Reason defines it as\n\u2018the absence of incompatibility among what is signified by the\nwords\u2019, and illustrates its definition by contrasting the\nsentence \u201cHe sprinkles the field with water\u201d with\n\u201cHe sprinkles the field with fire\u201d. The idea is that the\nactivity of sprinkling is \u2018compatible with\u2019 (i.e. can only\nbe done with) a liquid like water, and not with a substance like fire.\nIt would be like saying \u201cCathood is on the mat\u201d or perhaps\nChomsky\u2019s \u201cColourless green ideas sleep furiously\u201d.\nSuch sentences, though grammatically correct, do not make sense. This\ncausal factor, then, is that an utterance is intelligible only if the\nproposition expressed is ontologically possible, by the light of a\npreconceived ontological system, such as the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nsystem of categories. Some Naiy\u0101yikas, however, impose a more\ndemanding requirement, that to be \u2018semantically fit\u2019 the\nutterance must be true, i.e. that \u2018fit\u2019 =\n\u2018true\u2019, not merely \u2018possible\u2019, and\nconsequently that an utterance is intelligible only if it is true! In\neffect, they identify \u2018semantic fitness\u2019 with the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 or \u2018causal factor leading to\ntruth\u2019, in the language-processing mechanism. We will return to\nthis dispute a little later.\n9.2 Semantic Power and the Reduction of Semantic Properties\n\nThe Manual of Reason\u2019s definition of a word is\ncelebrated and often quoted. It says (TS 66) that a word is that which\nhas semantic power (\u015bakta\u1e43 padam). A sentence\n(v\u0101kya) is defined as a collection of words. So The\nManual of Reason\u2019s definition fits with the modern one,\naccording to which a word is a semantically significant sentential\nconstituent. Semantic power is that knowledge of which enables the\ncompetent hearer to interpret the word, and this, for the\nNaiy\u0101yikas, consists in the word\u2019s standing for an object.\nThus, someone who understands the word \u201ccat\u201d knows\nsomething of the form <\u201ccat\u201d means cat>, where\n\u201cmeans\u201d is a relation between words and objects of some\ntype. The Manual of Reason raises three questions about this\nrelation: (i) Is it a new and irreducible type or relation, not\nreducible, that is, to any of the relations already admitted (TSD\n66a)? (ii) What is the relatum, i.e. with what type of entity are\nwords semantically related (TSD 66b, k)? (iii) How do we learn the\nmeaning of a word (TSD 66c, d).\n\n(i) The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and Grammarians were\n\u2018essentialists\u2019 about meaning, arguing that the Sanskrit\nlanguage is a natural entity, independent of human convention or\nusage, whose words possess intrinsic semantic powers to signify\nobjects, just as fire has the intrinsic capacity to burn. The\nNaiy\u0101yikas traditionally opposed this view, arguing instead that\nlanguage is a product of convention, and that it is possible to\naccount for a word\u2019s semantic power in terms of stipulations\ngoverning its use. The claim is that we can define (and hence analyse)\nthe meaning-relation thus:\n\nx means y iff there is a decree/stipulation\n(sa\u1e45keta) of the form \u201cLet utterances of\nx generate cognitions of y\u201d.\n\n\nNow a stipulation or decree is claimed to consist in the\ndecree-maker\u2019s having a certain mental state, viz. a\n\u2018desire\u2019 or \u2018will\u2019 (icch\u0101) of\nthe form specified. Thus, the meaning relation is analysed in terms of\nmental states and their contents, and not as a new type of relation.\nWho is the decree-maker? The Manual of Reason states that it\nis God, but most later Naiy\u0101yikas drew a distinction between\nwords which have belonged \u2018endlessly\u2019 in the language\n(introduced by God) and words introduced by an explicit human\nstipulation (e.g. the technical terms in P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s\ngrammar).\n\n(ii) What is the meaning-relatum of a word like \u201ccow\u201d, a\ngeneric nominal expression? Here again The Manual of Reason\ncontrasts the Ny\u0101ya view with that of the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas. One sub-school of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas (the Bh\u0101tta) claim that the meaning of\n\u201ccow\u201d is the universal cowhood, since sentences like\n\u201c(The) cow is an animal\u201d, or injunctive laws like\n\u201cNever kick a cow\u201d, say something about the entire class\nof cows, not about any one individual. Thus:\n\n(Bh)\n\u201ccow\u201d means cowhood.\n\n\nIn reply to the obvious objection, that in many other sentences, such\nas \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d, a particular cow is\nreferred to, these M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas appeal to the idea that\na sentence can carry an \u2018implication\u2019\n(\u0101k\u1e63epa) other than its literal meaning. Thus the\nsentence \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d may mean literally\nthat cowhood is collocated with occurrence-in-the-garden (i.e. that\nthere exists a cow in the garden), but carries the implication that a\ncertain particular cow is in the garden. The principle here is that a\nprior awareness of the qualifier (vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47a)\nleads to an implicated awareness of the thing qualified\n(vi\u015be\u1e63ya) (TSD 66b). The Ny\u0101ya reply to this\nargument proceeds by way of rejecting the principle cited, for, they\nsay, awareness of a qualifier or universal is possible only via an\nawareness of the thing qualified.\n\nThe Manual of Reason states the modern Ny\u0101ya view: the\nmeaning of an utterance of the word \u201ccow\u201d is a particular\nindividual as qualified by cowhood\n(j\u0101ti-vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da-vyakti):\n\n(Ny)\n\u201ccow\u201d means a-cow-as-qualified-by-cowhood.\n\n\nThe idea is this. Anyone who understands an utterance of the sentence\n\u201c(The) cow is in the garden\u201d does so by (a) identifying a\ncertain object as the referent of the word \u201ccow\u201d, and (b)\ngrasps that that individual is qualified by the property\noccurrence-in-the-garden. However, one can only identify an object by\ndistinguishing it from others, and this involves the use of a\ndistinguishing feature. So the individual is grasped in awareness as\ndistinguished/qualified by the feature cowhood. Since the meaning of a\nword is, by definition, its contribution to the final belief generated\nby hearing the utterance containing the word, the meaning of\n\u201ccow\u201d is an individual as qualified by cowhood. Note that,\non such a theory, token utterances of \u201ccow\u201d vary with\nrespect to the individual to which they refer, but every token\nutterance nevertheless shares a common semantic property, viz. \u201c\n\u2026\u2014qualified-by-cowhood\u201d. The Naiy\u0101yikas in\nthis way draw a distinction between type- and token- meaning (or, as\nsome say, between meaning and reference).\n\nThe other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43aka sub-school (Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara)\nclaim that, in order to explain the fact that, on hearing a sentence,\nwe grasp a unified proposition and not just a list of entities, the\nmeaning-relatum of a word like \u201ccow\u201d is \u2018an object\nconnected with another\u2019 (itar\u0101nvita). The\nmeaning-relatum is a cow along with a \u2018hook\u2019 to link it\nwith other meaning-relata. More precisely, the meaning of the word\nwould be something like\n\n(Pr)\n\u201ccow\u201d means a cow-individual, which is\n     \u2026\u2026\n\n\nSo the sentence \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d does not just\nmean the list <cow, being in the garden>, as it would if each\nword simply designated an object, but rather the connected proposition\n<cow-which-is in-the-garden>. The idea, in effect, is that all\nmeaning-relata, are, in Frege\u2019s terminology,\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019. To this ingenious suggestion, The\nManual of Reason replies (TSD 66k) that it is superfluous, for\n\u201csince it is possible for the relation [between meaning-relata]\nto be apprehended as what is signified by the sentence [as a whole],\nit is not necessary to postulate a semantic power with reference to\nthe relation\u201d. In other words, The Manual of Reason\nclaims that general (presumably syntactic) features of the sentence\nare enough to connect the meaning-relata, without needing to claim\nthat those meaning-relata themselves do the connecting.\n\n(iii) The Naiy\u0101yikas offer the following account (TSD 66c) of\nlanguage acquisition. The child makes a series of observations\nconcerning the linguistic behaviour of adults. She hears adult A utter\na certain noise \u201cBring the cow\u201d say, and sees adult B\nperform a certain action, bringing of the cow. Again, she hears A\nutter the noise \u201cBring the horse\u201d, and sees B bring the\nhorse, and hears \u201cFeed the cow\u201d and sees the cow being\nfed. Then, by a twin inductive process, of (a) \u201cagreement in\npresence\u201d (anvaya) and \u201cagreement in\nabsence\u201d (vyatireka)\u2014i.e. noticing the\ncorrelation between A making or not making an utterance and B\nperforming or not performing an action, and (b)\n\u2018collection\u2019 (\u0101v\u0101pa) and\n\u2018rejection (udv\u0101pa)\u2014i.e. noticing the\nregularities between utterances of \u201ccow\u201d and events\nconcerning the cow, utterances of \u201cbring\u201d and bringing\nevents, etc., the child understands that the word \u201ccow\u201d is\nlinked with objects belonging the class of cows, etc.\n\nThis is an empiricist account of language learning reminiscent of the\naccount attributed by Wittgenstein to Augustine, and severely\ncriticised by him. Apart from the superhuman inferential powers\nattributed to the child, the problem highlighted by Wittgenstein is\nthat no amount of observation can show, for example, that the relevant\ncorrelation is between \u201ccow\u201d and cow-individuals, and not\nbetween \u201ccow\u201d and B\u2019s cow-directed-actions, the\nuniversal cowhood, heifers rather than cows, etc. (cf. TSD 66d).\n9.3 Testimony\n\nThe Manual of Reason says that statements are either Vedic or\nsecular. It adds that (hearing a) Vedic statement is a\npram\u0101\u1e47a, a means of knowing that which is stated,\nbecause Vedic statements are originally uttered by God. (The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas dispute this. Not believing in God, they\nsay instead that a Vedic statement is a means of knowing precisely\nbecause it has no personal origin, and error in testimony is always a\nresult of human error in the source!) Hearing a secular statement is a\nmeans of knowing only if the speaker is an \u2018authoritative\nperson\u2019 (\u0101pta). An authoritative person is defined\nas one who speaks the truth (yath\u0101rthavakt\u0101). There\nis an ambiguity here: is an authoritative person one who is speaking\nthe truth with respect to the particular utterance in question, or one\nwho is generally truthful? Another question here is: must the\ntestifiee know that the testifier is an authority in this sense or\nnot?\n\nTo confuse matters further, The Manual of Reason says that\nthe \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019, causal factor responsible for\nthe truth of the testifiee\u2019s belief, is\n\u2018yath\u0101rtha-yogyat\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019,\nwhich can mean either (i) veridical cognition of semantic fitness, or\n(ii) cognition of veridical semantic fitness. In either case, the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 has nothing to do with the\nspeaker\u2019s credentials, it seems. Option (ii), however, must be\nwrong, for it cannot be a condition upon testimony that the hearer\nalready knows that what was said is true. Option (i), however, would\nnot guarantee that the final hearer\u2019s belief is true, unless by\n\u2018fitness\u2019 The Manual of Reason now intends a\nrather stronger notion, according to which the meaning-relata\n\u2018fit\u2019 together iff they are in fact connected, i.e. if the\nutterance expresses a truth. This is, indeed, how some other\nNaiy\u0101yikas understand the notion of yogyat\u0101, but\ndoes not accord with The Manual of Reason\u2019s own\ndefinition.\n\nI propose the following resolution. The language processing mechanism\nwas described above as one which issues in the testifiee believing\nthat which the testifier says. The truth of the testifiee\u2019s\nbelief will therefore depend upon whether or not the testifier is\nspeaking truly, and so this should be called the\n\u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 here. However, we do not always\nbelieve what we hear, especially if we have reasons to suppose that\nthe speaker is not likely to be speaking the truth. It is possible,\nthen, that the output of the language processing mechanism is not\nsimply belief in what was said, but rather belief simply\nthat it has been said. There are, roughly, two sorts of case\nwhen this can happen: (1) if the testifiee judges that the testifier\nis deceitful or unreliable or simply uninformed about the topic, and\n(2) if the testifiee knows on independent grounds that what the\ntestifier is saying is false (which is consistent with the testifier\nbelieving it and testifying sincerely), perhaps on a priori\ngrounds concerning the plausibility of the assertion. With a little\ninterpretative licence, we might think that these two conditions\ncorrespond to the two conditions imposed by The Manual of\nReason on testimony: that the testifier must be an\n\u2018authority\u2019 (\u0101pta), and that the sentence\nmust be \u2018semantically fit\u2019 (yogya).\n10. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Concepts of Universal, Inherence, and Basic Differentium\n10.1 Universals\n\nThe Manual of Reason reports the standard\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika definition of a universal\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya, j\u0101ti):\n\nA universal is something which is (i) eternal, (ii) unitary, and (iii)\nlocated in a plurality of things (substances, qualities or motions).\n(TS 82)\n\n\nUniversals are thus conceived of as unstructured, objective properties\nwhich necessarily reside in individuals. The postulation of such\nentities in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika schema has explanatory force,\naccounting for the distinction between \u2018natural\u2019 and\n\u2018conventional\u2019 classifications. Intuitively, this is the\ndistinction between groupings such as the class of cows or horses,\nwhich reflect natural divisions (\u201ccut nature at the\njoints\u201d), and those such as the class of Cabinet Ministers or\nthe class of endangered species, which reflect anthropocentric\nconcerns. The Naiy\u0101yikas mark this distinction by calling natural\nproperties \u201cuniversals\u201d (j\u0101ti) and\nanthropocentric properties \u201cimposed\u201d or\n\u201cnominal\u201d properties (up\u0101dhi).\nCorrelatively, a semantic distinction is drawn between \u201cnatural\nkind terms\u201d (naimittik\u012b), i.e. terms the basis for\nwhose application is a universal, and \u201cimposed kind\nterms\u201d, terms whose basis for application is an anthropocentric\nproperty. Udayana tried to make this distinction more precise by\ngiving a list of criteria for a property to count as natural.\nExamination of his list (which are called the\n\u201cj\u0101ti-b\u0101dhakas\u201d\u2014impediments\ndistinguishing natural properties) will reveal something further about\nthe nature of the natural properties according to Ny\u0101ya.\n\nThe six impediments are (1) \u2018non-plurality\u2019\u2014a\ngenuine universal must be plurally instantiated; (2)\n\u2018equipollence\u2019 (tulyatva)\u2014two co-extensive\nproperties cannot both be genuine universals; (3)\n\u2018cross-connection\u2019 (sa\u1e43kara)\u2014two\ngenuine universals must not partially overlap; (4)\n\u2018regress\u2019\u2014a property like universality cannot itself\nbe a universal, on pain of infinite regress (universality-hood, etc.\netc.); (5) a property like differentia-hood cannot be a genuine\nuniversal, for by definition the basic differentia share no common\nuniversal property; (6) a property like inherence-hood cannot be a\nuniversal, since it does not inhere in its loci. Of these six, the\nlast three are there basically to maintain the internal consistency of\nthe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system, and the first is a straightforward\nconsequence of the definition of a universal. It debars a\nsingly-instanced properties such as space-hood from the status of\ngenuine natural kind, perhaps motivated by the thought that the very\nnature of a universal consists in its grounding judgements of the form\n\u201cx is of the same kind as y\u201d, which\npresuppose that there are at least two entities.\n\nThe second and third criteria are the most important, and can be\nstated more formally as follows. If P and Q are\ndistinct properties, then (equipollence, tulyatva):\n\n[P] = [Q] \u2192 either P or Q (or\nboth) is not a universal,\n\n\nwhere \u2018[P]\u2019 denotes the extension of P.\nThe contraposed form is:\n\nP and Q are universals \u2192 [P] \u2260\n[Q].\n\n\nNote that this does not entail that universal properties are\nextensionally individuated or equivalent to classes, as some have\nmaintained. It shows only that corresponding to each class, there is\nat most one universal. Although, within the domain of universals, a\nuniversal is uniquely determined by its extension, the distinction\nbetween a universal and a co-extensive imposed property (e.g. pothood\nand conch-shell-like-neck-hood) is an intensional distinction.\n\nAs for the third impediment (s\u0101\u1e43karya), if\nP and Q are distinct properties, then\n\n[P] partially overlaps [Q] \u2192 either P\nor Q (or both) is not a universal.\n\n\nThe contraposed form is:\n\nP and Q are universals \u2192 [P] \u2282\n[Q] or [P] \u2283 [Q] or [P] \u2229\n[Q] = \u2205.\n\n\n(The inclusion is strict because of the \u2018equipollence\u2019\nconstraint.) In other words, genuine universals are arranged in a\nhierarchy: given two universals, either they are related as genus and\nspecies, all instances of one being instances of the other, or else\nthey are completely disjoint, having no instance in common (e.g.\ncowhood-animalhood, cowhood-treehood). The Ny\u0101ya say that, if one\nuniversal is thus subsumed by another, the former is\n\u2018lower\u2019 (apara) and the latter is\n\u2018higher\u2019 (para) (cf. TS 6). The\n\u2018highest\u2019 universal of all is \u2018existentness\u2019\n(satt\u0101), into whose extension falls every substance,\nquality and motion. The demand that universals be organised\nhierarchically shows that the Ny\u0101ya took as their paradigm the\nbiological species, which tend to exhibit this structure. Bearing in\nmind that the term for \u201cuniversal\u201d, i.e.\n\u201cj\u0101ti\u201d is also the word for caste, Matilal\n(1971: 76) speculates that\n\n[O]ne might discover in the Ny\u0101ya doctrine of generic property a\nremote influence of the socio-religious ideas of the Brahmins.\nTranslated into biological terms, the \u2026 principle of\n\u2018non-overlapping\u2019 becomes a principle which opposes\ncross-breeding. There is thus some evidence that the Ny\u0101ya bias\nfor real generic properties was partly influenced by the Brahmanical\nconcept of an ideal social order where intermixture of classes is not\nto be permitted.\n\n\nSome Naiy\u0101yikas, especially Bh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a and\nRaghun\u0101tha, reject the \u2018cross-connection\u2019 impediment,\npointing out the problems encountered trying to apply it to\nnon-biological natural kinds (e.g. redness and greenness overlap, as\ndo pothood and goldhood). Raghun\u0101tha suggests that consistent\napplication of this principle would eliminate virtually all universals\nfrom the ontology. Udayana\u2019s criterion of a property to be\n\u2018natural\u2019 is thus not a necessary one, and neither is it\nsufficient: none of his impediments shows why the pair\n\u2018blue-green\u2019 is more natural than Goodman\u2019s pair\n\u2018grue-bleen\u2019 (where x is grue iff x is green and examined\nbefore time t, and is blue otherwise, and vice versa for bleen.)\n\nThe idea that universals are, in some sense, \u2018located\u2019 in\nparticulars generated two distinctive objections to the theory.\nDi\u1e45n\u0101ga trades on the spatial metaphor to argue that the\nNy\u0101ya conception of universals is incoherent. For, if a universal\nis \u2018unitary\u2019, it can be located in at most one place, and\nthus not \u2018plurally instanced\u2019. If, conversely, if is\nlocated simultaneously at many places, that can only be because it has\nparts, each located at a different place, and hence is not\n\u2018unitary\u2019. This argument plays on the ambiguity of the\nnotion of \u2018being located\u2019, and pretends that a universal\nlike cowhood is located in individual cows in just the same sense that\na cow is located in a field. Nevertheless, it forces the Ny\u0101ya to\nbe more careful in its account of the universal-particular relation.\nAs The Manual of Reason notes (TS 84), a universal is said to\nreside in its instances by the relation of \u2018inherence\u2019\n(samav\u0101ya), defined as an \u201cinseparability\u201d\n(ayutasiddhi) relation. Of two entities, x and\ny,\n\nx is inseparable from y iff x cannot exist\nunless y exists.\n\n\nThe idea is that a cow cannot exist unless the universal cowhood\nexists, and that it is in this sense that cowhood is located in the\ncow. (The same relation is claimed to occur between non-repeatable\n\u2018qualities\u2019 (gu\u1e47a) and substances, a whole\nand its parts, and the basic differentia and the atoms.) Spatial\nlocation, on the other hand, involves a quite different relation,\nnamely contact (sa\u1e43yoga). In this way, the term\n\u2018location\u2019 is disambiguated.\n\nThe other problem is the classic one: what happens to a universal if\nall its instances are destroyed? Can universals exist without being\ninstantiated? The definition of the inherence relation permits this,\nfor the requirement is that cows cannot exist without cowhood, not\nvice versa. We might say that the cow\u2019s existence supervenes on\nthat of the universal cowhood. However, it is not so clear that we can\nsay in the same way that the parts (of a car, say) cannot exist unless\nthe whole (car) exists.\n10.2 The Basic Differentia (vi\u015be\u1e63a)\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika traditionally and uniquely accept into their\nontology a category of item called \u2018basic differentia\u2019\n(vi\u015be\u1e63a), from which, some claim, they derive\ntheir name. The Manual of Reason defines these items as\nfollows (TS 83): \u201cthose entities which reside in the eternal\nsubstances [i.e. the atoms] and function as their differentiators are\ncalled vi\u015be\u1e63a\u201d. The idea is that, just as a\ncow and a horse are distinct entities, as they have distinct\nproperties, so too even two atoms of the same substance, e.g. earth,\nmust differ with respect to at least one property. Each atom,\ntherefore, possesses a \u2018differentium\u2019 unique to itself,\nwhich serves to distinguish it from any other atom of the same type.\nThe assumption, then, is that any two non-identical items are\ndistinguished by virtue of possessing distinct properties. This is the\ncontraposed version of Leibniz\u2019 Law that Indiscernibles are\nIdentical, that (\u2200P)(Px \u2261\nPy) \u2192 (x = y), where\n\u201cP\u201d ranges over properties. The principle faces\ntriviality unless certain constraints are placed on the range of\nproperties quantified over. For example, if the property\n\u201c\u2026 = y\u201d is permitted, the principle states\nvacuously that identicals are identical. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nimplicitly restrict the principle to intrinsic, non-relational\nproperties of the objects concerned, ruling out, for example,\n\u2018being at a certain spatial or temporal location\u2019 as being\na property capable of discriminating two otherwise identical objects.\nThus, the claim seems to be that no two objects, including atoms, can\nbe intrinsically identical. This is how Leibniz himself appears to\nhave understood his Law, saying that \u201cIt is always necessary\nthat beside the difference of time and place there be internal\nprinciples of distinction\u2026.thus although time and place serve\nin distinguishing things, we do not easily distinguish them by\nthemselves,\u201d and that \u201cThere is no such thing as two\nindividuals indiscernible from each other. Two drops of water, or\nmilk, viewed with a microscope, will appear distinguishable from each\nother\u201d.\n\nThe principle is, admittedly, as strong one. Wittgenstein\n(Tractatus 5.5302) points out that it entails the logical\nimpossibility of a universe containing two identical spheres; Wiggins\nnotes that it implies the logical impossibility of even a single\nsphere (or any other symmetrical object), since it entails the\nidentity of the two hemispheres (and so on until one reaches a\ngeometrical point). More to the point, as the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nimplicitly realised, it implies the logical impossibility of more than\none atom of a given substance (having a certain velocity, spin, etc.).\nRather than reject the principle, however, they instead introduced new\nintrinsic properties, the basic differentia, thereby avoiding the\nunpalatable consequence.\n11. The Ontology of Nonexistence (abh\u0101va) and the Semantics of Negative Statements\n11.1 Motivations\n\nThe later Naiy\u0101yikas develop a remarkable theory of nonexistence.\nAccording to them, the absence of an object or feature at a\nparticular spatial or temporal location is a state of affairs just as\nobjective as the presence of the object or feature there. To\nKan\u0101\u1e0da\u2019s original list of six categories\n(pad\u0101rtha) or types of existent, they therefore add a\nseventh, \u2018absence\u2019 (abh\u0101va). This\nontological doctrine is underpinned by (i) phenomenological and (ii)\nsemantic considerations.\n\n(i) The phenomenological point was that a negative awareness, say that\na certain person is not in the room, is a kind of awareness\nphenomenally distinct from any awareness about what is in the room.\nCognition of what is not has an autonomous phenomenology (this idea is\nnotably articulated by Sartre). The principle appealed to is thus:\n\nP1\nExperiences of nonexistence are phenomenally distinct from, and\n  irreducible to, experiences of existents.\n\n\nThe idea emerges in the Ny\u0101ya epistemology with their claim that\nabsence is perceived, and that this perception is a sui\ngeneris type of perceptual experience, not reducible to a\ncombination of ordinary perception and inference (cf. the sixth type\nof sensory connection in Uddyotakara\u2019s list).\n\n(ii) The semantic point is that the Ny\u0101ya espouse a version of\nthe correspondence theory of truth, according to which true sentences\ncorrespond to facts. It is alleged that true negative sentences (e.g.\n\u201cThe pot is not on the ground\u201d) correspond to\n\u2018negative facts\u2019. Facts, however, are all, for the\nNy\u0101ya, of the same basic relational form, \u2018bRa\u2019 (they\nare said to have a qualificand-relation-qualifier structure; i.e. they\nare complexes of existing entities). This restriction on what\nconstitutes a fact is expressible via the following semantical\nprinciple:\n\nP2\nSentences correspond to facts constructed out of simple or\ncomplex entities (i.e. entities like \u2018a\u2019, \u2018absence\nof a\u2019, \u2018a-&-b\u2019, \u2018a-or-b\u2019).\n\n\nThe principle entails that one cannot use the truth-functional\nconnectives to construct facts, except where they are equivalent to\nterm-logical connectives. (For example, the sentence \u201cRama and\nSita are righteous\u201d is equivalent to \u201cRama is righteous\nand Sita is righteous\u201d, but the term-connective in \u201cRama\nand Sita are married\u201d is not similarly eliminable in favour of\nthe truth-functional conjunction \u201cRama is married and Sita is\nmarried\u201d.) The point is that a sentence like \u201cThe pot is\nnot on the ground\u201d cannot correspond to a fact of the form\n\u2018\u00acbRa\u2019 (as there are no such facts according to\nP2), but must rather correspond to a fact of the form\n\u2018bR\u0101\u2019. Hence the introduction into one\u2019s\nontology of negative entities.\n11.2 Temporally and Spatially Located Absence\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 85\u201388) reports the usual\nNy\u0101ya view that there are four types of absence: prior\nnonexistence (pr\u0101gabh\u0101va); posterior nonexistence\nor \u2018destruction\u2019 (dhva\u1e43sa);\n\u2018constant\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 absence\n(atyant\u0101bh\u0101va); and difference\n(anyony\u0101bh\u0101va). Of these, the first two refer to\npossible temporal states of a transient object. Suppose we represent\nthe temporal duration of a person A by the following line\n(assuming that he lived between 1650 and 1750):\n\n\n\nt1\n1650\nt2\n1750\nt3\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\n\nAt any time t1 prior to 1650, A does not\nyet exist, and at any time t3 later than 1750,\nA no longer exists. In accordance with the above principles,\nNy\u0101ya reformulates these negative existential claims as positive\nexistential statements about negative entities, namely, the\n\u2018prior absence of A\u2019,\n\u2018<A\u2019 say, and the \u2018posterior absence of\nA\u2019, \u2018A>\u2019 say. Thus, the first\nreads:\n\n<A exists at t1,\n\n\nor, since, in the Ny\u0101ya idiom, objects are said to be located in\ntime as well as in space,\n\n<A is located at t1.\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\nA> is located at t3.\n\n\nWhat happens at times such as t2? These are times\nat which A exists or is present (is located). Note,\nfurthermore, that, at t2, there is a posterior\nabsence of <A (for the prior absence of A is\ndestroyed when A comes into existence), which we designate by\n\u2018(<A)>\u2019. There is also a prior absence of\nA> (for the posterior absence of A does not yet\nexist), i.e. \u2018<(A>)\u2019. The Manual of\nReason (TSD 89E) records the older Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 claim\nthat these double absences must be identical with the original entity,\non pain of an infinite regress. Thus:\n\n(<A)> = <(A>) = A.\n\n\nLater Naiy\u0101yikas apparently disputed this natural identity (which\ncorresponds to the Law of Double Negation in classical logic), on the\nground that double negative constructions contain the concept of\nnegation, and hence are logically more complex.\n\nA third type of absence, called \u2018constant\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019 absence (atyant\u0101bh\u0101va) is\nillustrated by constructions of the form \u201cThe pot is not on the\nground\u201d. The Manual of Reason states (TS 87) that what\ndistinguishes this type of absence is that it is located in the three\ntimes\u2014past, present and future. This seems odd, as it might be\nthat the pot is on the ground at some times but not others. Perhaps\nthe point is that the locus of the absence here is a spatial entity\nrather than a temporal one. For example, the construction \u201cHeat\nis not in ice\u201d illustrates this kind of absence. Perhaps,\nfurthermore, the force of this negation is that the pot is\nnever located on the ground\u2014hence we cannot speak of\nthe prior or posterior absence of the pot (for these concepts are\ndefined in terms of times when the pot is present). (E.g.\nUdayana\u2019s definition of a substance as that which does not have\na constant absence of qualities.)\n\nThe fourth type of absence, \u2018difference\u2019\n(anyony\u0101bh\u0101va), is illustrated by the sentence\n\u201cThe pot is not (the) cloth\u201d. This is to be read as a\nnon-identity statement.\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas thus say that every negative sentence is the\nnegation of a sentence of the form\n\u201caRb\u201d, and they distinguish\nbetween cases where the relation R is the identity relation\nand cases where it is a relation other than identity. The object\na is called the locus of the absence, and the object\nb is called the \u2018counterpositive\u2019 or\n\u2018negatum\u2019 (pratiyogin) of the absence, i.e. it is\nthe object whose presence in the locus is being denied. This\nhighlights the fact that absences are thought of as a kind of property\nor \u2018locatable\u2019, rather than as a kind of\n\u2018location\u2019 (at least when the relation is not identity).\nFor example, the absence of A is located in many places at\nonce. It is not said that there is a distinct absence-of-A at\neach and every place where A is absent. We can now see how\nthe Ny\u0101ya parse negative sentences without using a sentential\nnegation. Take the sentence \u201cThe pot is not blue\u201d. The\nfirst-order paraphrase of this would be: It is not the case that the\npot is blue (\u00acFa). The Ny\u0101ya strategy is\nfirst to say that every property, such as blueness, has both an\nextension F (places where it is located) and a\ncounter-extension F\u2032 (places where its absence is\nlocated), and then to paraphrase the sentence as: The pot has\nabsence-of-blue. Note that a partially locatable property is one for\nwhich the extension and counter-extension overlap\u2014it is possible\nfor a feature to be collocated with its absence.\n11.3 The Logic of Negation\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 89) makes some very interesting\nobservations about the logical properties of absence or negation.\n\nReference versus description. It is claimed that\nthere is a distinction between a qualified absence\n(vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101bh\u0101va) and a mere absence\n(keval\u0101bh\u0101va). Consider the following pair of\nsentences:\n\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not in the room, and\nThe author of The Manual of Reason is not in the\nroom.\n\n\nThe idea is that in (3) the \u2018mere\u2019 absence of\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is located in the room, whereas in (4) a\nqualified absence (of Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da as qualified by\nauthorhood) is located in the room. Do (3) and (4) really have\ndistinct logical forms? Perhaps we find here a realisation that\nnominal expressions such as \u201cThe author of The Manual of\nReason\u201d have two distinct logical functions, namely those\nof referring to an individual and describing an\nindividual via his properties. (4) can thus be read either as\nasserting the same as (3), that Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not in the\nroom, or as saying that the author of The Manual of Reason,\nwhoever it or she is, is not in the room, i.e. that the properties\n\u201cbeing the author of The Manual of Reason\u201d and\n\u201cbeing in the room\u201d are not collocated. If that is the\nsense in which (4) involves a qualified absence, then (3) and (4) do\nhave different logical forms.\n\nUniversal Quantification. The Manual of\nReason draws another very important distinction, between a\nspecific absence (vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101bh\u0101va) and a\ngeneric absence (s\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101bh\u0101va). These are\nillustrated by the following sentences:\n\n(This) pot is not in the room, and\n(Any) pot is not in the room\n\n\n(N.B. they would be expressed by the same sentence in Sanskrit; hence\nthe brackets). To say that there is a specific absence of pot in the\nroom is to say that some particular pot is not in the room, but to say\nthat generic absence of pot in the room is to say that any pot is not\nin the room (i.e. no pot is in the room). The distinction is thus\nlinked to the formulation of universally quantified constructions.\nIndeed, in Ny\u0101ya logical theory, generic absences are used to\nformulate the pervasion (vy\u0101pti) relation: \u201cwhere\nthere is smoke there is fire\u201d is contraposed to give\n\u201cwhere there is no fire there is no smoke\u201d, and this is\nexpressed by saying that there is a generic absence of smoke in places\nwhere there is a generic absence of fire (cf. Ingalls 1951:\n54\u20135). It is clear that (5) and (6) do have distinct logical\nforms. In the Ny\u0101ya technical language, the distinction is made\nout by saying that the property which delimits the counterpositiveness\nof the absence (i.e. the pratiyogit\u0101vacchedaka) is\nthis-pot-hood in (5), but pothood in (6).\n\nLogical Connectives and De Morgan\u2019s Laws.\nThe Manual of Reason touches on the meaning of conjunctive\nand disjunctive absence, i.e. absence of (both A and\nB) (ubhay\u0101bh\u0101va) and absence of (either\nA or B) (anyatar\u0101bh\u0101va). It\nobserves that an awareness that two pots are absent is consistent with\nan awareness that one pot is present (and the other absent). In fact,\nas Ingalls shows (1951: 63\u201367) the Ny\u0101ya recognised the\nvalidity of two general equations:\n\n\nabsence of (both A and B) = (absence of A)\nor (absence of B), and\n\nabsence of (either A or B) = (absence of A)\nand (absence of B).\n\n\nThese are recognisably versions of De Morgan\u2019s Laws, that\n\u00ac(A & B) \u2261 \u00acA \u2228\n\u00acB, and that \n\u00ac (A\u2228B) \u2261 \u00acA & \u00acB. \nAs an example of the second of\nthese laws, consider Mathuran\u0101tha\u2019s remark (1951: 66) that\na \u2018heap\u2019 of (specific) absences\n(abh\u0101va-k\u016b\u1e6da) is equivalent to a generic\nabsence. A place which is the locus of generic absence of fire is a\nplace at which every particular fire is absent, and conversely, if\nevery specific fire is absent, then fire is generically absent. Thus\nthe \u2018heap\u2019 (conjunction) of specific absences of fire, is\nequivalent to the absence of any fire at all (the disjunction of\nspecific fires).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"NavNyyTexEngTra\">Navya-Ny\u0101ya Texts in English Translation</a>", "<a name=\"GenWor\">General Works</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"NavNyyTexEngTra\">Navya-Ny\u0101ya Texts in English Translation</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>The Manual of Reason</em> (Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da).\n<em>Tarkasa\u1e43grahad\u012bpik\u0101 on Tarkasa\u1e43graha</em>,\nedited and translated by G.
