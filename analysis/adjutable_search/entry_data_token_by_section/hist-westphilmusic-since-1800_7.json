    "main_text": "Twentieth Century || Phenomenology of Music\n2.1 Phenomenology of Music\n\nEdmund Husserl (1859\u20131938) developed phenomenology as a\nphilosophical method aimed at grounding any objectivity in the\nfirst-person experiences through which it is constituted. Husserl\ndevoted to music only passing observations, the best known of which is\nthe illustration of his analysis of time consciousness by means of the\nexperience of perceiving a melody (Husserl 1991). Other philosophers\nadopted a phenomenological methodology to carry out more systematic\ninvestigations (for a survey, see Lippman 1992: chapter 14).\n\nIn The Work of Music and the Problem of Its Identity, the\nPolish philosopher Roman Ingarden (1893\u20131970) adopted a\nphenomenological approach to conduct one of the first systematic\ninvestigations of musical ontology. From the methodological point of\nview, Ingarden embraces a descriptive approach. In his words:\n\n\nHowever fully developed, every theory of musical works that is not\nmere speculation but seeks a base in concrete facts must refer to the\npresystematic convictions that initially gave direction to the search.\n(Ingarden 1973 [1986: 1])\n\n\nOn this basis, he rejects the identification of musical works with\nideal objects, such as mathematical entities, for musical works come\ninto existence when they are first composed (Ingarden 1973 [1986: 15];\na phenomenological account of musical works as ideal objects had been\nproposed by Waldemar Conrad (1878\u20131915) (1908), whose view\nIngarden explicitly challenges). Works of music cannot be identified\nwith their score either, as they can be composed without being notated\nand may even exist in the complete absence of notational systems\n(Ingarden 1973 [1986: 38]). Ingarden holds instead that musical works\nare intentional objects. While they require an experiencing subject,\nthey cannot be identified with particular subjective experiences. This\nalso accounts for the temporality that is characteristic of musical\nworks. While a work\u2019s performance is extended in time, the work\nitself is not a temporal object. It merely specifies an order of\nsuccession between its elements. The musical work is thus\n\u201cquasi-temporal\u201d (Ingarden 1973 [1986: 70]). Ingarden also\naccounts for the apparent change of a work through time, a change that\nmay seem evident when one considers the radical differences in the\nperformance of the same work at different historical times. However,\ninsofar as the set of legitimate interpretations of a work is\ndetermined by its score, this change is one not in the work itself,\nbut merely in what is considered valuable about it (Ingarden 1973\n[1986: 156]) (on Ingarden\u2019s musical ontology, see Mitscherling\n1997: chapter 5).\n\nThe phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (1899\u20131959) is another\nphilosopher whose work on music deserves mention. Schutz\u2019s\nFragments Toward a Phenomenology of Music was written in\n1944, but published posthumously in 1976, and can be found in the\nfourth volume of his collected papers (Schutz 1996: 243\u2013275).\nSchutz starts from the rather commonplace observation that music is\nmeaningful though it lacks a conceptual or representational content.\nThis feature he connects with a less obvious property of musical\nworks. Some ideal objects may be grasped both monothetically as well\nas polythetically, that is, through a series of passages as well as in\none glance. For instance, I could follow the steps that lead to the\ndemonstration of Pythagoras\u2019s theorem and come to understand it,\nbut once I have done that I may also grasp the theorem in one single\nact, by grasping the proposition that expresses it (Schutz 1996:\n247\u2013248). But this is only possible because the theorem has a\nconceptual content that may be grasped once it has been understood.\nPrecisely because it lacks such content, music can only be grasped\npolythetically by following its development as we listen to it, or\nwhen we recollect its unfolding. Thus,\n\n\nthe statement that music cannot be caught monothetically is merely a\ncorollary of the thesis that the meaning-content of music is not\nrelated to a conceptual scheme. (Schutz 1996: 249)\n\n\nThis conclusion allows Schutz to break some ground in quite a\ndifferent area, one that remains relatively underexplored in Western\nphilosophy of music. In the essay Making Music Together\n(1951), Schutz considers the \u201cmutual tuning-in\nrelationship\u201d (Schutz 1951: 79) that is necessary to the\ninteractions between the various actors involved in music-making\n(composer, performers, and listeners). The polythetic constitution of\nthe musical object is what ultimately allows this relationship, as the\nvarious participants in music-making share a common \u201cflux of\nexperiences in inner time\u201d (Schutz 1951: 96).\n\nPhenomenology remains a widely adopted philosophical method. A more\nrecent phenomenological analysis of musical experience is found in\nClifton 1983.\n",
