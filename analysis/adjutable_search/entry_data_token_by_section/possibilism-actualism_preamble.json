    "main_text": "\n\nActualism is a widely-held view in the metaphysics of\nmodality that arises in response to the thesis of\npossibilism. To understand the motivations for possibilism,\nconsider first that most everyone would agree that things might have\nbeen different than they are in fact. For example, no one has free\nsoloed the Dawn Wall route up El Capitan in Yosemite National Park\nand, given the almost superhuman physical ability and mental strength\nthe feat would require and, more importantly, the massive risk it\nwould entail, it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone ever will. But it\nis surely possible that someone pulls it off\u2014the Dawn\nWall has, after all, been successfully free climbed, so a free solo is\nnot beyond sheer human\n capacity.[1]\n Thus, the following assertion (expressed in a somewhat stilted but\nunambiguous logical form for purposes here) is true:\n\n(1)\nPossibly, there is someone who free soloes the Dawn Wall.\n\n\nAgain, the current Pope (as of November 2022) Jorge Bergoglio,\nalthough childless, might well have had children; instead of the\npriesthood, he could have chosen, say, tango dancing as his profession\nand married his longtime dance partner. So it is true that\n\n(2)\nPossibly, there is someone who is Bergoglio\u2019s child.\n\n\nPossibilism emerges from the question of the truth conditions\nfor such possibilities, the question of what it is about reality that\naccounts for their truth value. The assertion that there are\ntigers, for example, is true because reality, in fact, contains\ntigers; the assertion that someone has free soloed the Dawn Wall or is\nBergoglio\u2019s child is false because reality, in fact, contains no\nsuch things. But what accounts for their possibility? That\nis, what is it about reality that accounts for the truth of\n (1)\n and\n (2)?\n\nIn the case of\n (1),\n the answer is easy: there are, in fact, many people who could free\nsolo the Dawn Wall\u2014notably, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson,\nthe two who first free-climbed it. But it is at least\nlogically possible that any human being do so\u2014for any\ngiven person, it is easy to imagine perfectly consistent (if perhaps\nidealized and utterly improbable) scenarios in which they are\nmassively healthier, stronger, and more skilled than they actually are\nand, so endowed, free solo the Dawn Wall. Thus,\n (1)\n is true because:\n\n(3)\nThere is someone such that, possibly, they free solo the Dawn\nWall.\n\n\nA bit more generally (and philosophically) put,\n (1)\n is true in virtue of the modal properties of actually\nexisting things, that is, equivalently put, in virtue of properties\nthey could have had and, indeed, would have had if\nonly things had been different in certain ways. Crucially, the same\nappears not to be so in the case of\n (2).\n For on the reasonable assumption that\n\nno one could have had different parents than the ones they in fact\n have[2]\n and\nno non-human thing could have been human,\n\n\nit follows straightaway that no actually existing thing could have\nbeen Bergoglio\u2019s child. Hence, the parallel to\n (3),\n viz.,\n\n(4)\nThere is someone (or something) such that, possibly, they are\nBergoglio\u2019s child.\n\n\nappears to be false. Unlike\n (1),\n then, it appears that we cannot provide truth conditions for\n (2)\n of the same satisfyingly straightforward sort as (3).[3]\n\nPossibilists claim that we can: we must simply broaden our\nunderstanding of reality, of what there is in the broadest\nsense, beyond the actual, beyond what actually\nexists, so that it also includes the merely possible. In\nparticular, says the possibilist, there are merely possible people,\nthings that are not, in fact, people but which could have\nbeen. So, for the possibilist,\n (4)\n is true after all so long as we acknowledge that reality also\nincludes possibilia, things that are not in fact\nactual but which could have been; things that do not in\nfact exist alongside us in the concrete world but which could\nhave. Actualism is (at the least) the denial of\npossibilism; to be an actualist is to deny that there are any\npossibilia. Put another way, for the actualist, there is no\nrealm of reality, or being, beyond actual existence; to be is to\nexist, and to exist is to be actual. In this article, we will\ninvestigate the origins and nature of the debate between possibilists\nand actualists.\n",
