    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || Rousseauian Self-Estrangement\n2.5 Rousseauian Self-Estrangement\n\nFrank Kirkland notes Du Bois\u2019s description of\ndouble-consciousness as a \u201cfeeling\u201d, and articulates that\nfeeling through Rousseau\u2019s notion of amour-propre, the\nform of \u201ccivilized\u201d self-love that is reflective,\ncontrastive, and radically corrosive of social solidarity.\n(Rousseau\u2019s account distinguishes amour-propre from\namour de soi, an instinctual urge to self-preservation;\namour-propre is a purely social feeling.)\n\nDu Bois\u2019 \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d refers to a black\nperson\u2019s felt awareness of the harmfully comparative measures of\nothers on her character and self-esteem, by which s\u2044he takes\nherself to be a problem in and of a social arrangement permitting such\nmeasures or obliging them. (2013: 144)\n\n\nFor Kirkland, Du Bois\u2019 conception of double-consciousness is\ninherently comparative, the consequence of amour-propre in\nconditions of the color line. Du Bois, according to Kirkland, began\nfrom the \u201cinflamed amour-propre of others\u201d:\n\nthose (of the darker races) have their own respect and esteem \u2026\ndenied or underestimated by others (of the lighter races), thereby\nagitating and worsening the color line. (2013: 140)\n\n\nFor Kirkland amour-propre is not the cause of the color-line,\nbut it does spread its reach and intensify its effects. Kirkland also\nstresses the element of awareness within double-consciousness, in\nkeeping with the Rousseauian analogy:\n\n[F]or Du Bois, this comparison gone awry is a matter about which black\npeople are, at least, sentient, awake to, even if they have not\ngrasped it conceptually,\n\n\nwrites Kirkland, adding that this is \u201ctheir sentience to the\ncomparison by which they are made a problem\u201d (2013: 140).\n\nKirkland follows the \u201cFaith\u201d text in identifying two forms\nof the danger double-consciousness poses for African-Americans: a\n\u201cdual/duelist\u201d threat of internally conflicted aspirations\nand expectations, and a \u201cduplicitous\u201d hypocritical stance.\nBoth these arise from the felt need to maintain self-esteem given\nhostility to one\u2019s ideals. Notably, Kirkland also identifies a\nthird, \u201cdyadic\u201d form of double-consciousness which\n\nwould reflect, via education, the result of an individual coming to a\ntrue, non-estranged comprehension of the position s\u2044he deserves\nin comparison to others as both a citizen and a person of color with\ncertain talents and competences. (2013: 142)\n\n\nThis \u201cnon-estranged\u201d mode of double-consciousness is a\n\u201csolution to the hazards\u201d of the other two forms,\naccording to Kirkland.\n",
