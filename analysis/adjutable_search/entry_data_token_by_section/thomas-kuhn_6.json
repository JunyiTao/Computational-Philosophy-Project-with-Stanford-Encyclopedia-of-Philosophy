    "main_text": "Incommensurability and World-Change || Kuhn\u2019s Early Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\n4.3 Kuhn\u2019s Early Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\n Although the theory-dependence of observation plays a significant\nrole in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, neither it\nnor methodological incommensurability could account for all the\nphenomena that Kuhn wanted to capture with the notion of\nincommensurability. Some of his own examples are rather\nstretched\u2014for instance he says Lavoisier saw oxygen where\nPriestley saw dephlogisticated air, describing this as a\n\u2018transformation of vision\u2019 (1962/1970a, 118). Moreover\nobservation\u2014if conceived of as a form of perception\u2014does not\nplay a significant part in every science. Kuhn wanted to explain his\nown experience of reading Aristotle, which first left him with the\nimpression that Aristotle was an inexplicably poor scientist (Kuhn 1987). But\ncareful study led to a change in his understanding that allowed him to\nsee that Aristotle was indeed an excellent scientist. This could not\nsimply be a matter of literally perceiving things differently. Kuhn\ntook the incommensurability that prevented him from properly\nunderstanding Aristotle to be at least partly a linguistic, semantic\nmatter. Indeed, Kuhn spent much of his career after The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions attempting to articulate a semantic\nconception of incommensurability.\nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn asserts\nthat there are important shifts in the meanings of key terms as a\nconsequence of a scientific revolution. For example, Kuhn says:\n\n\u2026 the physical referents of these Einsteinian concepts are\nby no means identical with those of the Newtonian concepts that bear\nthe same name. (Newtonian mass is conserved; Einsteinian is\nconvertible with energy. Only at low relative velocities may the two\nbe measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived\nto be the same.) (1962/1970a, 102) \nThis is important, because a standard conception of the transition\nfrom classical to relativistic physics is that although Einstein\u2019s\ntheory of relativity supersedes Newton\u2019s theory, what we have is an\nimprovement or generalization whereby Newton\u2019s theory is a special\ncase of Einstein\u2019s (to a close approximation). We can therefore say\nthat the later theory is closer to the truth than the older\ntheory. Kuhn\u2019s view that \u2018mass\u2019 as used by Newton cannot\nbe translated by \u2018mass\u2019 as used by Einstein allegedly\nrenders this kind of comparison impossible. Hence incommensurability\nis supposed to rule out convergent realism, the view that science\nshows ever improving approximation to the truth. (Kuhn also thinks,\nfor independent reasons, that the very ideas of matching the truth and similarity\nto the truth are incoherent (1970a, 206).)\nKuhn\u2019s view as expressed in the passage quoted above depends upon\nmeaning holism\u2014the claim that the meanings of terms are\ninterrelated in such a way that changing the meaning of one term\nresults in changes in the meanings of related terms: \u201cTo make\nthe transition to Einstein\u2019s universe, the whole conceptual web whose\nstrands are space, time, matter, force, and so on, had to be shifted\nand laid down again on nature whole.\u201d (1962/1970a, 149). The\nassumption of meaning holism is a long standing one in Kuhn\u2019s\nwork. One source for this is the later philosophy of\nWittgenstein. Another not unrelated source is the assumption of holism\nin the philosophy of science that is consequent upon the positivist\nconception of theoretical meaning. According to the latter, it is not\nthe function of the theoretical part of scientific language to refer\nto and describe unobserved entities. Only observational sentences\ndirectly describe the world, and this accounts for them having the\nmeaning that they do. Theories permit the deduction of observational\nsentences. This is what gives theoretical expressions their\nmeaning. Theoretical statements cannot, however, be reduced to\nobservational ones. This is because, first, theoretical propositions\nare collectively involved in the deduction of observational\nstatements, rather than singly.  Secondly, theories generate\ndispositional statements (e.g. about the solubility of a substance,\nabout how they would appear if observed under certain circumstances,\netc.), and dispositional statements, being modal, are not equivalent\nto any truth-function of (non-modal) observation\nstatements. Consequently, the meaning of a theoretical sentence is not\nequivalent to the meaning of any observational sentence or combination\nof observational sentences. The meaning of a theoretical term is a\nproduct of two factors: the relationship of the theory or theories of\nwhich it is a part to its observational consequences and the role that\nparticular term plays within those theories. This is the\ndouble-language model of the language of science and was the standard\npicture of the relationship of a scientific theory to the world when\nKuhn wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn\u2019s\nchallenge to it lay not in rejecting the anti-realism implicit in the\nview that theories do not refer to the world but rather in undermining\nthe assumption that the relationship of observation sentence to the\nworld is unproblematic. By insisting on the theory-dependence of\nobservation, Kuhn in effect argued that the holism of theoretical\nmeaning is shared by apparently observational terms also, and for this\nreason the problem of incommensurability cannot be solved by recourse\nto theory-neutral observation sentences.\n(Although it is true that Kuhn uses the expression \u2018physical\nreferent\u2019 in the passage quoted above, this should not be taken\nto mean an independently existing worldly entity. If that were the\ncase, Kuhn would be committed to the worldly existence of both\nNewtonian mass and Einsteinian mass (which are nonetheless not the\nsame). It is implausible that Kuhn intended to endorse such a view. A\nbetter interpretation is to understand Kuhn as taking reference, in\nthis context, to be a relation between a term and a hypothetical\nrather than worldly entity. Reference of anything like the Fregean,\nworldly kind plays no part in Kuhn\u2019s thinking. Again this may be seen\nas a reflection of the influence of one or other or both of the\n(later) Wittgensteinian downplaying of reference and of the positivist\nview that theories are not descriptions of the world but are in one\nway or another tools for the organization or prediction of\nobservations.)\n",
