    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Generation\n5.2 Generation\n\nIn this section we discuss four kinds of mental capacities or\nprocesses that researchers have posited for generating new ideas.\n5.2.1 Blind Variation\n\nPsychologist Donald T. Campbell (1960, 1965) proposed that creative\nthought proceeds through \u201cblind variation and selective\nretention (BVSR)\u201d. The \u201cvariations\u201d he refers to are\nthe various ideas that might occur to a creator, and the process of\ngenerating them is \u201cblind\u201d to the extent that it is not\nguided or directed by prior knowledge of how valuable or useful they\nwill be: \u201cReal gains must have been the products of explorations\ngoing beyond the limits of foresight or prescience,\nand in this sense blind\u201d (Campbell 1960: 92, emphasis added).\nOnce ideas have been generated, however, there is a subsequent stage\nwhere the creator selectively retains some of those ideas while\ndiscarding others, and Campbell says this stage is\n\u201csighted\u201d rather than blind since it is guided by\nthe creator\u2019s judgments as to which ideas are valuable. While\nthere is little debate that selective retention is sighted in this\nsense, there has been more controversy over whether the initial\nproduction of ideas is, by contrast, blind.\n\nIn his prolific body of work, Dean Keith Simonton has extended and\nrefined Campbell\u2019s proposal. His work nicely illustrates the\ninterdisciplinary nature of creativity research as he, like Campbell,\nis a psychologist who engages with philosophers, some of whom are\nbroadly sympathetic to the BVSR theory (Briskman, 2009; Nickles,\n2003), while others are skeptical (Kronfeldner 2010, 2011, 2018). In\nearlier writings Simonton suggested, in a way Campbell did not, that\nBVSR is to be understood on the model of Darwinian evolution (Simonton\n1999a, 1999b). But Simonton (forthcoming: 2\u20133) has come to\nrescind the Darwinian framing of BVSR, conceding that it is\nmisleading. Reprising Campbell\u2019s core idea, he says that a\nprocess of generating an idea is blind to the extent that it is not\nguided by \u201cthe creator\u2019s prior knowledge of the\nvariation\u2019s utility\u201d (Simonton forthcoming: 5; cf.\nSimonton 2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2018). He stresses that blindness is not\nall-or-nothing; it comes in degrees. An example of a highly sighted\nprocess is that of using the quadratic formula to find the roots of a\nquadratic equation: you know in advance that if you apply the formula\ncorrectly, it will yield the correct answer. Examples of relatively\nblind processes include remote association and mind wandering.\n5.2.2 The Default-Mode Network\n\nDespite the foregoing criticism of BVSR, recent neuroscientific\nstudies suggest a network of brain activity that may serve the blind\nvariation role. Brain activity doesn\u2019t cease when one is not\nfocusing on a task, when one is at rest, daydreaming, and so on.\nFollowing this insight, researchers have used neuroimaging methods to\nidentify what is now called the default mode network (DMN).\nThe precise anatomy of this network is still a matter of\ninvestigation, but it is supposed to be less active when one is\nfocused on an external task (say a problem in the real world or in the\nlab) and more active when one is not so focused (Raichle et al. 2001;\nBuckner & DiNicola 2019). Notice then, that while this network is\nnot creativity-specific\u2014it is supposed to be active during\nmemory recall, imagining future events, daydreaming, and so\non\u2014it does seem especially well-suited for creativity, and\nparticularly for the random idea generation hypothesized by the BVSR\n(Jung et al. 2013). Creativity researchers in these fields often refer\nto this more \u201cfree\u201d production of ideas as\n\u201cdivergent thinking\u201d, and some argue on the basis of\nneuroimaging studies that creative thought requires cooperation\nbetween this mode of thought as well as that under \u201cexecutive\ncontrol\u201d. As one team puts the point,\n\n\nIn general, we contend that the default network influences the\ngeneration of candidate ideas, but that the control network can\nconstrain and direct this process to meet task-specific goals via\ntop-down monitoring and executive control.. (Beaty, Benedek, et al.\n2016; see also Mayseless, Eran, & Shamay-Tsoory 2015; Beaty, Seli,\n& Schacter 2019; Chrysikou 2019)\n\n\nNotice how well this comports with both the Geneplore and the BVSR\nframeworks, perhaps identifying a way to keep some of the insights of\nboth without commitment to a special creativity mechanism after\nall.\n5.2.3 Imagination\n\nAt least since Kant, theorists have identified an important link\nbetween creativity and imagination; indeed, the two are sometimes\nunfortunately conflated. Construed broadly, imagination can take\nvarious forms: sensory imagery, propositional imagination,\nsupposition, free association. Berys Gaut (2003, 2009, 2010) and\nStokes (2014, 2016) have both recently argued that, although\nimagination and creativity are distinct, imagination is especially\nwell-suited to creative thought because of its characteristic\nflexibility. They both agree that imagination is decoupled from action\n(Gaut 2003) and \u201cnon-truthbound\u201d (Stokes 2014) in the\nsense that, unlike belief, imagination is not limited by the proper\nfunction of accurately representing (some part of) the world. This\nfreedom or playfulness of imagination is crucial to generating new\nideas, since it allows one to safely \u201ctry out\u201d hypotheses,\nconceptual combinations, strategies for solutions, and so on, without\nepistemic or behavioral commitment.\n\nA series of studies illustrates both the need for non-truthbound\ncapacities in creative thought, as well as the difficulty of employing\nthem. When people\u2014children and adults alike\u2014are asked to\nimagine and draw non-existent houses, people, or animals, they depict\nthings that are strikingly similar to their familiar counterparts in\nthe real world: imagined people, for example, were generally drawn\nwith some version of a head, limbs, eyes, and so forth.\n(Karmiloff-Smith 1990, 1992: 155\u201361; Cacciari et. al 1997; Ward\n1994, 1995). This suggests that we are highly constrained in our\ncreativity by the concepts we already have. Concepts of existing\nthings are truth-bound: your concept of an animal, for example, has\nthe proper function of accurately representing the range of things\nthat are in fact animals. When you try to envision a new, fictional\nkind of animal, you begin with a mental image that exemplifies your\nexisting concept of animal, which is why you are constrained by that\nconcept. You then have to manipulate your initial image,\nvarying its features in ways that abandon the aim of accuracy, using a\ncapacity that isn\u2019t truthbound. Generalizing this point yields\nthe cognitive manipulation thesis, according to\nwhich creative thought requires cognitive manipulation, which involves\nthinking in ways that are not bound to the truth (Stokes 2014: 167).\nPlausibly, imagination is the mental capacity which is best suited to\nserve in this cognitive manipulation role. In the studies just cited,\nsubjects must use their imagination to manipulate their existing\nconcepts so as to form new ideas.\n\nRecent empirical research on visual imagery seems to corroborate this\nclaim. Various studies have identified positive correlations between\ncreative problem solving and visual image generation, image\ntransformation, and vividness of imagery (Finke 1990, 1996; Zemore\n1995; R. Morrison & Wallace 2001; P\u00e9rez-Fabello and Campos\n2007). A more recent study highlights the importance of image\ntransformation ability\u2014the ability to mentally manipulate a\ngiven image\u2014and the ability to achieve high degrees of visual\ncreativity. Further, the results of this study suggest that although\nvividness negatively correlates with the practicality of images\ncreated, vividness positively correlates with novel idea generation\n(Palmiero et al. 2015). The novelty involved is minimal, but again it\nappears that imagination, here in the form of imagery, well serves the\nrole of cognitive manipulation.\n\nStokes observes further that we can voluntarily control imaginative\nstates (in contrast with other non-truthbound states, like desires and\nwishes). And because imagination connects in important ways with\ninferential systems, as well as affective systems, the thoughts it\nproduces can often be integrated with knowledge and skills to\nformulate an innovative strategy or solution to a problem. Finally,\nthis role for imagination in creativity is not exclusive to the rich\ncreativity of artists and scientists, but indeed seems to characterize\nthe minimally creative behavior that we all enjoy. This claim is\npartly motivated by the empirical research just discussed. Here, as in\nthe more radical cases, instances of novel achievement or learning by\nsubjects requires more than rote memorization; it requires cognitive\nmanipulation of the information in the relevant conceptual space\n(e.g., combining concepts about houses and persons). This kind of\ncognitive activity is best done by using the imagination.\n\nPeter Carruthers has argued that imagination is important to\ncreativity on evolutionary grounds (2002, 2006; see also Picciuto\n& Carruthers 2014). Like the above analyses, he focuses on the\nplayfulness of imagination. Pretend play typically develops early in\nchildhood in humans. And imagination in adults provides the right\nmechanisms for generating and exploring ideas (just as required by the\nGeneplore model). Carruthers argues that imagination evolves under\nadaptive advantage as a kind of practice for adult\ncreativity\u2014and may have been accordingly selected for, aligning\nwith the putative creativity explosion of 40,000 years ago (Mithen\n1996, 1998; Harris 2000). This, he argues, is the most parsimonious\nexplanation of both the emergence and the ubiquity of creativity in\nthe human species. See B. Gaut (2009) for a critique of\nCarruthers\u2019 analysis.\n5.2.4 Incubation\n\nWhile we may generate ideas consciously in imagination, we may also do\nso during a period of unconscious incubation, when we are focused on\nsomething else. This point is illustrated by any number of famous\nstories, though some are probably embellished after years of\nretelling. Isaac Newton witnessed an apple fall from a tree (on some\naccounts, falling upon Newton\u2019s head) and thereby found the\ninsight for his laws of gravity. August Kekul\u00e9 is reported to\nhave discovered the structure of the benzene molecule while\ndaydreaming of a serpent circling upon and seizing its own tail. Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 alleged that, while boarding a bus, he enjoyed a\nneeded flash of insight that led to his discovery of non-Euclidian\ngeometry. Richard Feynman, the Nobel prize winning physicist, claimed\nto find inspiration while sipping soda and doodling at adult clubs.\nAnd Einstein reported:\n\n\nI was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a\nsudden a thought occurred to me. \u201cIf a person falls freely he\nwill not feel his own weight\u201d. I was startled. This simple\nthought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory\nof gravitation. (Einstein, \u201cKyoto Lecture\u201d, translated and\nquoted in Pais 1982: 179)\n\n\nIn each case, someone is suddenly struck with a flash of insight about\none thing while engaged with something else entirely. The\nempirically-minded theorist rejects the notion that such ideas arise\nex nihilo or through divine possession. So how are they\nexplained in terms of natural mental phenomena?\n\nArthur Koestler, partly inspired by the work of Henri Poincar\u00e9\n(1908 [1913]), hypothesized that during creative thought processing,\nideas are combined in novel ways, and this combination is performed\nlargely unconsciously, by what Poincar\u00e9 called the\nsubliminal self (Koestler 1964: 164\u20135). For Poincar\u00e9\nthere are only two ways we might think of the unconscious. One, we\nmight think of the unconscious in Freudian terms, as a self capable of\ncareful and fine discernment and, importantly, distinctions and\ncombinations that the conscious self fails to make. Alternatively (and\nthis is the option favored by both Poincar\u00e9 and Koestler), we\ncan think of the unconscious as a sub-personal automaton that\nmechanically runs through various combinations of ideas. Importantly,\nthis unconscious process (or, if one likes, automaton) generates\nrandom conceptual associations and ideas. And these can then be\nfurther considered, examined, explored, and revised.\n\nThese behavioral methods can be combined with contemporary\nunderstanding of neural plasticity and the effects of cognitive effort\nand attention. Neuroscientists have long recognized that the human\nbrain is plastic\u2014stable in genetic material but\nconstantly undergoing functional change and development in neural\nnetworking in response to external stimuli, with the work of Donald\nHebb in the middle of the twentieth century being one important early\nprecedent. As Hebb put it, neural cells that \u201cfire together,\nwire together\u201d. Cell assemblies thus form as a result\nof the synchrony and proximity of the firing of individual cells.\n\n\n[A]ny two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the\nsame time will tend to become \u201cassociated\u201d, so that\nactivity in one facilitates activity in the other. (Hebb 1949 [2002:\n70])\n\n\nAnd continued attention to a problem, what some have called\ncerebral effort, causes changes in the networking of the\nbrain\u2019s cortex (Donald 2001: 175\u20138). Importantly, these\nchanges can continue to take place, to \u201creverberate\u201d even\nafter one has removed attention from that problem. This motivates a\nsimple (and somewhat unsurprising) hypothesis: attending to and\nperforming cognitive tasks affects neural networking (Posner et al.\n1997; Posner & Raichle 1994; see also Kami et al. 1995), and those\nchanges can involve strengthening of synaptic connectivity (which\ncorrelate with conceptual connections and associations). These\nchanges, again, can occur both when one is attending to a task and\nafter one has diverted attention elsewhere. And, finally, the latter\ngoes some way to explain a moment of insight after incubation (the\nso-called incubation effect): when one returns attention to the target\nproblem, new or newly strengthened neural connectivity (as a result of\nprevious cognitive effort) can give rise to a new idea. And because\nthat neural process is not in any sense done by you, the\nemergence of the new idea can feel like a burst of insight (see Stokes\n2007; Thagard & Stewart 2011; Ritter & Dijksterhuis 2014; and\nHeilman 2016).\n\nThere are also various recent studies on closely related topics: on\nmindwandering and spontaneous thought (Christoff et al. 2016; Irving\n& Thompson 2018; Murray et al. forthcoming), on so-called\n\u201cdivergent thinking\u201d (Mekern et al. 2019), and more on the\nneural basis of insight (Jung-Beeman et al. 2004; Bowden et al. 2005;\nLimb & Braun 2008; Dietrich & Kanso 2010; Kounios & Beeman\n2014).\n5.3 Insight\n\nIt should be intuitive that creativity often involves solving problems\nand doing so in interesting or surprising ways. In exceptional cases,\nthe individual identifies a problem solution that perhaps no one\n(including the creator) anticipated. But there are countless examples\nof more mundane instances of problem solving, where the solution may\nbe surprising (or especially interesting) to only a few individuals,\nperhaps even only to the problem solver. One broad, standard\nexperimental method used by researchers thus focuses on\ninsight in problem solving. Some problems (thankfully!) can\nbe solved by straightforward appeal to memory, or by applying some\ntechnique or method of calculation in a mechanical way. Solving the\nproblem may still take time and effort, but the solution will come so\nlong as one executes the appropriate strategy or applies the relevant\nknowledge from memory. An insight problem, by contrast, typically\nrequires something new on the part of the individual, and one must\noften \u201cchange views\u201d of the structure of the very problem.\nPredictably, there are a variety of definitions or characterizations\nof \u201cinsight\u201d in the literature. Here are two recent,\nrepresentative examples. Bowden et al. suggest that insight occurs\n\n\nwhen a solver breaks free of unwarranted assumptions, or forms novel,\ntask-related connections between existing concepts or skills. (Bowden\net al. 2005: 322)\n\n\nMore recently, Kounios and Beeman write,\n\n\nwe define insight as any sudden comprehension, realization, or problem\nsolution that involves a reorganization of the elements of a\nperson\u2019s mental representation of a stimulus, situation, or\nevent to yield a nonobvious or nondominant interpretation. (2014:\n74)\n\n\nSome early studies on these phenomena centered around a familiar\nobservation. Consider the tip-of the-tongue phenomenon, when you know\nthat you know some bit of information (an actor\u2019s name or the\ntitle of a song) but, try as you may, you just can\u2019t recall it.\nIt often helps to give up for a moment and allow the memory to surface\nwithout effort. Researchers found that the same\napproach\u2014forgetting about a problem\u2014works well to overcome\nfixation on ineffective ideas so as to allow the actual solution to\npop up. Smith and Blankenship primed two groups of subjects with\ninappropriate or misleading solutions to problems. They left one group\nto continue struggling with the same problem, while they distracted\nthe second group with a distinct but cognitively demanding task. The\nsecond group thereby overcame fixation and outperformed the first\ngroup when returning attention to the original target problem (Smith\n& Blankenship 1989, 1991; see also Smith, Ward, & Finke\n1995).\n\nIn the context of creativity in particular, there is precedent, or at\nleast overlap, in Colin Martindale\u2019s cortical arousal theory.\nThis theory centers around the nature of focuses of attention\n(Martindale 1977, 1981, 1995, 1999; Martindale & Armstrong 1974;\nMartindale & Hines 1975). Martindale proposes a multi-stage model\nof problem solving, which if the right mechanism is possessed, leads\nto creative thought. In the initial stages, information is gathered,\nvarious approaches are taken to the problem, and there is a high level\nof cortical arousal with a narrow focus of attention. As information\nincreases and the problem remains unsolved, two kinds of responses may\noccur. The first kind of response is to keep attempting the same\nsolutions to the problem such that the arousal and attention focus\nstay high and narrow, respectively. Alternatively, some persons\nexperience a decrease in cortical arousal coupled with a wider range\nof attention focus. Information then enters what Martindale calls\nprimary processing: a kind of subconscious cognition not under the\ncomplete control of the agent. It is this kind of processing, and the\narousal mechanisms that enable it, that distinguish creative insight\nor achievement from non-creative ones. The first kind of response\ntypically results in frustration and failure (fixation), while the\nsecond often results in creative insight.\n\nThere are at least two, separable components of insight thus\nunderstood. First, an insight problem requires non-mechanical or\nnon-algorithmic solution, and this in turn requires some kind of\nconceptual reorganization. A hackneyed phrase may come to mind here:\none has to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d.\n\nThe second element of insight as understood here is subjective or\nphenomenological. An insightful problem solution is often described as\noccurring suddenly and with little or no apparent effort. It is an aha\nmoment, even if less dramatic than the traditionally romanticized\nEureka moment. One way researchers have tested for this subjective\nfeature is to ask subjects to report nearness or \u201cwarmth\u201d\nrelative to solving a problem. They find that for insight problems, by\ncontrast to non-insight problems, subjects report that as they near\nsolution they experience abrupt changes in the sense of warmth for\nsolving the problem (Metcalfe & Wiebe 1987; see also Dominowski\n1995; Laukkonen & Tangen 2018). More recently, researchers have\nbegun to employ neuroimaging techniques to study insight and\ninsightful problem solving (Luo & Niki 2003; Mai et al. 2004).\n\nFirst, researchers have developed methods for using subjective report,\nwhere subjects rate whether they felt that they used insight in\nsolving a designated problem (Bowden et al. 2005). And second, and\ncoupled with those report methods, researchers have developed simple\nproblems that can be solved with insight. One such example is the\n\u201cCompound remote associates problem\u201d (CRA). Here is an\nexample of a CRA problem:\n\n\nEach of the three words in (a) and (b) below can form a compound word\nor two-word phrase with the solution word. The solution word can come\nbefore or after any of the problem words.\n\nfrench, car, shoe\nboot, summer,\n ground[1]\n\n\n(Bowden et al. 2005: 324)\n\n\nBecause of their simplicity, these problems can be solved\nunambiguously and quickly, and with this speed comes better potential\nfor neuroimaging study. In instances where subjects report insight\nsolutions to these kinds of problems,\n\n\nEEG shows a burst of high-frequency (gamma-band) EEG activity over the\nright temporal lobe, and fMRI shows a corresponding change in blood\nflow in the medial aspect of the right anterior superior temporal\ngyrus (Jung-Beeman et al. 2004). (Kounios & Beeman 2014: 78)\n\n\nThe question for neuroscientists is whether this convergence of\nevidence is sufficient to establish neural correlates of insight.\n5.4 Evaluation\n\nA moment of \u201cinsight\u201d can be misleading, as what initially\nstrikes you as a promising idea may ultimately turn out to be a dead\nend. You may have countless ideas in the course of undertaking a\ncomplex creative project, while only a few of them will make the final\ncut. A crucial part of your creative work therefore consists in\nevaluating your ideas. For any idea that occurs to you, you might have\nto ask: Will this work? Is it new? How does it fit in with other parts\nof your project? Do you have the resources and abilities to bring it\nto fruition? Is it worth the time and effort?\n\nMuch of the research on this phase of the creative process is\nconcerned to identify and categorize the range of factors that people\ntake into consider as they evaluate their ideas (Blair & Mumford\n2007; Dailey & Mumford, 2006). Unsurprisingly, those factors vary\nfrom one domain to another. New culinary dishes are judged by factors\nlike aroma, taste, texture, color, presentation (Horng & Lin\n2009), whereas improved musical performances are judged according to\ntheir complexity, originality, and technical virtuosity (Eisenberg\n& Thompson 2003), and so on. Your understanding of the relevant\nfactors is part of your internalized model of the domain (Bink &\nMarsh, 2000; Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer 1995). And since you\nacquired and refined that model through years of preparation, your\ncapacity for evaluation is largely a consequence of your efforts from\nthat initial stage.\n\nSomewhat more surprisingly, there is some evidence that people who are\ngood at evaluating ideas are also good at generating them (Runco 1991;\nRunco & Dow 2004; Runco & Chand 1994; Runco & Vega\n1990).\n\nOther studies support what Sawyer calls Sawyer (2012: 131) calls the\nproductivity theory, which says that the best way to get good\nideas is to have lots of ideas and just throw away the bad ones. In\nhistoriometric studies, Simonton found that creators who yielded the\ngreatest number of works over their lifetimes were mostly likely to\nproduce works that were significant and stood the test of time. Even\nmore striking, he discovered that, from year to year, the periods when\ncreators were most productive were also the ones in which they were\nmost likely to do exceptional work (Simonton 1988a, 1988b). Linus\nPauling, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 as well as the\nNobel Peace Prize in 1962, summed up the productivity theory in a\nfamous remark:\n\n\nIf you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them\nwill be wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away.\n(quoted by Crick 1995 [time 34:57])\n\n5.5 Externalization\n\nThe final operation of the creative process\u2014externalizing\nideas\u2014may involve any number of disparate activities, which\nKeith Sawyer sums up as follows:\n\n\nCreativity research has tended to focus on the early stages of the\neight-stage creative process\u2014particularly on the idea-generating\nstage. But a lot has to happen to make any idea a reality. Successful\ncreators are skilled at executing their ideas, predicting how others\nmight react to them and being prepared to respond, identifying the\nnecessary resources to make them successful, forming plans for\nimplementing the ideas, and improvising to adjust their plans as new\ninformation arrives. These activities are important in all creativity,\nbut are likely to be even more important in practical domains such as\ntechnological invention and entrepreneurship (Mumford, 2003;\nPolicastro & Gardner, 1999). (Sawyer 2012: 133\u20134)\n\n\nIt may be tempting to assume that the real creative work is finished\nonce a new idea emerges in the moment of insight, and that\nexternalization is just the uncreative, mechanical chore of making the\nidea public. But a closer look at the phenomenon reveals that\nexternalization is often integral to creativity itself.\n\nVera John-Steiner (1985) interviewed, and examined the notebooks of,\nover 70 exceptional creators (ranging from author Ana\u00efs Nin to\ncomposer Aaron Copland), and consulted the notebook of another 50\neminent historical creators such as Leo Tolstoy and Marie Curie. A\nrecurring theme throughout was that at the beginning of each creative\nendeavor and continually throughout its development, creators\nmanipulate and build upon their impressions, inklings, and tentative\nhunches using sketches, outlines, and other external\nrepresentations.\n\nPerkins (1981) corroborated this finding by analyzing the 61 sketches\nPicasso made en route to painting his famous work, Guernica,\nas well as Beethoven\u2019s musical drafts and Darwin\u2019s\nnotebooks. In each case, the artist progressed by engaging with\nexternal representations.\n\nOther studies found that people discovered and solved more problem\nwhen they used sketches during a task (Verstijnen 1997), and that\npeople come up with better ideas for improving inventions when they\nwork with visual diagrams (Mayer 1989).\n\nOne reason externalization is so vital to substantial creative work is\nbecause of our limited capacity to consciously hold and manipulate\ninformation in our minds. It helps to offload ideas and store them in\nthe form of physical symbols and expressions in order to free up space\nfor the mind to examine those ideas at arm\u2019s length while\nentertaining new ones. Thus research shows that internal strategies\nlike mental visualization can help with relatively simple tasks, but\nfor more complex projects externalization is key (Finke et al. 1992:\n60).\n5.6 Worries and future directions\n\nWe close our survey of the cognitive science of creativity with a\nbrief discussion of some general worries about current work, and some\nprescriptions for future research.\n\nSome have worried about the validity of the psychometric measures\nemployed in neuroimaging studies. One such concern regards the\nconfidence that we should have that the tests employed are really\ntracking creative behavior. This is of course a general problem,\npartly symptomatic of the challenges that come with defining\ncreativity (like other phenomena) and with the special challenges that\nattach to features such as insight and incubation. But there are\nparticular challenges that come with using neuroimaging technologies\nsuch as fMRI scanning to attempt to study naturally occurring\nphenomena. Use of this technology is almost invariably ecologically\ninvalid\u2014one cannot run an fMRI in the artist\u2019s studio. And\nbecause of the cost and sensitivity of these imaging systems, the\ncorrelative behavioral tests are often significantly abbreviated. This\nmay impose constraints on space for occurrence of the target\nphenomena\u2014novel thinking and insight\u2014during the imaging\nsession. As one researcher worries,\n\n\nToo often single tests are used\u2014or even single items! This is\ncontrary of psychometric theory in general (where longer tests allow\nerrors to cancel themselves out and are thus more reliable) and true\nof the research on creativity assessment in particular, where\ndifferences among items and even tests are common (Richards, 1976;\nRunco, Mohamad, & Paek, 2016 [sic should be Runco, Abdulla et al.\n2016). Results from any one test will not generalize to other tests.\nResults from a single item of course have even less generalizability.\n(Runco 2017: 309\u2013310; see also Abraham 2013)\n\n\nAnother empirical researcher criticizes what he sees as \u201cthe\nwild goose chase\u201d in the neuroscience of creativity. Arne\nDietrich (2019) recapitulates the above worries about validity of\npsychometric measures and their abbreviated and piecemeal application.\nHe further worries about the now dominant emphasis on divergent\nthinking, and the default mode network (as well as the now mostly\nabandoned emphasis on notions such as madness, the right brain, and\nREM sleep). Dietrich\u2019s concern in each case is that the research\nemphasis is unhelpfully myopic, and that while the imaging methods are\nsound and state of the art, the characterization of creativity is not.\nHe decries the temptation to identify what may be a feature\nof creativity with the whole of the phenomenon. Divergent thinking, he\nsuggests, is likely a cluster of various mental phenomena rather than\na singular one, and\n\n\nthere is no effort underway to dissect divergent thinking and link it\nto the kinds of cognitive processes we use to operationalize all other\npsychological phenomena, such as working memory, cognitive control,\nsemantic memory, perceptual processes, or executive attention. (2019:\n37)\n\n\nNotice, then, that the \u201cwild goose\u201d for Dietrich is to\nhastily conclude and then center studies around a singular, special\ncreativity mechanism.\n\nDietrich also offers various prescriptions for remedy. To combat\nmyopia, he suggests (as some have in other disciplines, e.g., Boden\n2004) a plurality of types of creativity (and/or features of\ncreativity). He cautions,\n\n\nSince different types of creativity contain opposing brain\nmechanisms\u2014focused versus defocused attention, for\ninstance\u2014any all-encompassing claim about creativity in the\nbrain will almost certainly qualify as phrenology. (2019: 39)\n\n\nHe pairs this with a prescription for a more interdisciplinary\napproach to the topic. Others in the field have made the same\nprescription, advocating a \u201csystems\u201d approach sensitive\nboth to the multi-faceted nature of creativity and the value of\ntheorizing at multiple levels of explanation (Hennessy & Amabile\n2010).\n\nThese directives for future research seem hard to resist. At the very\nleast, it would seem advantageous to ensure that the full range of\nempirical method across the behavioral and brain sciences is\ncommunicated across the relevant sub-disciplines. This would ideally\nlead to better collaboration amongst such researchers. What\u2019s\ninteresting is that a cousin to this prescription is not well heeded\nby the same researchers advancing it here. However little crossover\nthere is between, say, behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists in\nstudies of creativity, there is comparatively even less crossover\n(almost none) between the psychological sciences and computational\napproaches to creativity. The next section thus begins by highlighting\nthis \u201cgap\u201d, and identifying some of the potentially\nfruitful areas for interdisciplinary work on that front. It then\ncontinues with a discussion, generally, of research on creativity in\nthe fields of computing science, artificial intelligence, and\nrobotics.\n6. Creativity and Artificial Intelligence\n\nJust as we find in psychology and neuroscience, there is a rich\nresearch literature on creativity in artificial intelligence and\ncomputer science, with devoted journals, special issues, and\nconferences (The Journal of Artificial Creativity, The\nJournal of Creative Music Systems, Digital Creativity,\nMinds and Machines special issue on Computational Creativity\n[Gerv\u00e1s et al. 2010], The International Conference on\nComputational Creativity). The question we focus on here is\nwhether a computer could be creative. As background, it is\nworth considering how theorists approached the analogous question as\nto whether a computer could think.\n\nAlthough theorists of various kinds have asked whether machines can\nthink since at least the early modern period, the most important\nconceptual innovations on the topic came from Alan Turing, centering\naround his 1950 paper \u201cComputing machinery and\nintelligence\u201d. Here Turing provided a number of groundbreaking\ninsights. Perhaps most familiar is Turing\u2019s \u201cimitation\ngame\u201d, now commonly known as \u201cthe Turing Test\u201d. In\nbrief, the test involved an unknowing interrogator who could ask an\nopen-ended series of questions of both a human and a computer. If the\ninterrogator could not distinguish computer from human, Turing\npostulated that this would suffice to illustrate genuine intelligence.\nThere is no shortage of controversy regarding the aptness of the test\nfor intelligence, and arguably no computer has yet passed it. (For\nmore thorough discussion of Turing and the Turing test see entries on\n Alan Turing,\n Turing machines, and\n the Turing test).\n\nSuccessful performance in Turing\u2019s game would require remarkable\nbehavioral flexibility. And it is highly operational: specify a\nthreshold for imitation, and then simply allow the interrogator to ask\nquestions, then assess performance. If the behavior is sufficiently\nflexible to fool the interrogator, Turing claimed, the behavior was\nintelligent and, therefore, the computer intelligent.\n\nWith this background in mind, what are some of the cases in AI\nresearch lauded as success cases, and how do they align with some of\nTuring\u2019s criteria?\n\nMany of the familiar success cases are highly specialized. Deep\nBlue defeated chess master Garry Kasparov (Kasparov &\nGreengard 2017); some language processing systems managed to navigate\nsocial contexts such as ordering from a menu at a restaurant (Schank\n& Abelson 1977); AlphaGo more recently defeated the world\nchampion Go player. This specialization is both a virtue and a\nlimitation. On the one hand, achievement in such a specialized domain\nimplies an exceptional amount of detailed memory and skill. On the\nother hand, this knowledge and skill does not generalize. Neither\nDeep Blue nor Alpha Go could successfully order from\na menu, along with countless other basic human tasks. Put in terms of\nTuring\u2019s imitation game, these systems would fail miserably to\nfool a human, or even remotely imitate one (except for their\nperformance in a very narrow domain). What about systems such as\nIBM\u2019s Watson, which famously won (against humans) on\nthe television game show Jeopardy! This performance is more\ngeneral, since topics on the show vary widely, and seemed to require\nboth language comprehension and some minimal reasoning skills (see\nentry on\n artificial intelligence\n for extended discussion). Even so, Watson\u2019s capabilities are\nstill quite limited: it cannot make fluid conversation \u201cin real\ntime\u201d and is largely insensitive to temporal and other factors\nthat come with context.\n\nThere are many, many more examples of computational systems that\ndisplay sophisticated behavior, from the highly specialized to the\nmore general. On the language processing front, very recent AI systems\nsuch as\n OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT\n and\n Google\u2019s LaMDA\n significantly outperform the systems described above. To be clear,\nthese are remarkable achievements that display substantial complexity\nand, it appears in some cases, significant flexibility\u2014features\nTuring highlighted in characteristically human behaviors. But this\nalso underscores a distinction, often invoked by critics of artificial\nintelligence research. There is a difference between a\ncomputer\u2019s displaying or merely imitating an intelligent\nbehavior, and a computer\u2019s instantiating intelligence through\nsuch behavior. And the critic will say, even if a computer behaves\nas if it is intelligent, this is just modeling or simulating\nintelligence. The greater ambition, though, is \u201cgenuine\nartificial intelligence\u201d, a system that actually\nthinks. John Searle refers to this as the distinction between\n\u201cweak AI\u201d and \u201cstrong AI\u201d, respectively.\n\n\nWeak AI: Could a computer behave as\nif it thinks?\nStrong AI: Could a computer genuinely think?\n\n\n\nThe general worry here is that however sophisticated a system\u2019s\nbehavior may appear \u201cfrom the outside\u201d, for all we know it\nmay just be a \u201chollow shell\u201d (Haugeland 1981 [1997]; Clark\n2001). The worry has then been fleshed out in various ways by\nspecifying what is missing from the shell, as it were. Here are three\nstandard such candidates. And, again, in each case however\nsophisticated the computer\u2019s behavior may appear it still may be\nlacking in any or all of the following. First, the computer may lack\nconsciousness. Second, the computer may lack any\nunderstanding of the symbols over which it computes (Searle\n1980). Finally, the computer may operate without caring about\nits own behavior or, as John Haugeland colorfully puts it, without\n\u201cgiving a damn\u201d. In each case, any kind of response from\nthe ambitious AI researcher encounters the substantial challenges that\ncome with theorizing mental phenomena such as consciousness,\nunderstanding, linguistic competence, and emotion. (Turing 1950, for\ninstance, recognized but largely eschewed these kinds of topics).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ask whether computers could think, and another\nto ask whether they could be creative. And just as the prospect of\nartificial intelligence or thinking divides into two\nquestions\u2014of weak AI and strong AI\u2014we may distinguish two\nanalogous questions about artificial creativity, which we\u2019ll\nrefer to as the questions of \u201cweak AC\u201d and \u201cstrong\nAC\u201d, respectively. To begin with the former:\n\n\nWeak AC: Could a computer behave as\nif it\u2019s creative?\n\n\n\nSomething behaves as if it\u2019s creative if it produces things\nwhich are psychologically new (new to that thing) and\nvaluable. Arguably, a number of computers have already done\nthat.\n\nIn the 1970s, Harold Cohen began using computational technologies to\nproduce new drawings and paintings. The work of his computer painter,\nAaron, has exhibited at galleries such as the Tate and the Victoria\nand Albert Museum in London. David Cope\u2019s \u201cEMI\u201d\n(Experiments in Musical Intelligence) has composed musical works in\nthe style of various known composers and styles, even a full-length\nopera. Some of these works have been recorded and produced by bona\nfide record labels. Just search \u201cEmily Howell\u201d on Spotify\nor Apple Music and give it a listen (Cope 1996, 2006). Simon\nColton\u2019s The Painting Fool is an ongoing project,\ninvolving a software that abstracts phrases, images, and other items\nfrom newspaper articles and creates collage-style pieces. It has also\nproduced portraits, based on images of film characters, of the same\nindividual in different emotional states (see Painting Fool\nin\n Other Internet Resources;\n see Colton 2012 for theoretical discussion). Even more recently,\nthere have been explosive developments in generative art systems like\nDALL\u2022E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, VQGAN+CLIP. (For discussion\nsee Paul & Stokes 2021). In all of these cases, the relevant\noutputs of the computer program are new relative to its past\nproductions\u2014so they are psychologically (or behaviorally) novel,\nwhich again is all the novelty that creativity requires. And although\nhistorical novelty isn\u2019t required for creativity, it\u2019s\nworth noting that these products appear to be to be new in all of\nhistory as well.\n\nWhat about value? As noted above in\n \u00a72.1,\n some theorists reject the value condition, but even if value\nis required for creativity, that too is a condition these\ncomputer artworks seem to meet. Assessments of value can be\ncontroversial, but that is no less true for the outputs of human\ncreativity. The fact that these works are critically acclaimed,\nshowcased in prestigious galleries, and commissioned by selective\nrecord labels testifies to their artistic merit, and viewers find them\npleasing, interesting, and appealing, even before being apprised of\ntheir unusual origin. So it is reasonable to conclude computer\nprograms like the ones just described exhibit at least weak AC insofar\nas they produce works of valuable novelty, and one could cite many\nmore examples in the same vein.\n\nSome theorists have noted that, whether or not the original Turing\ntest is a good test for intelligence or thinking, we might adopt an\nanalogous test for creativity: If a computer can fool human observers\ninto thinking that it is a human creator, then it is in fact creative\n(Pease & Colton 2011; see also Chen 2020 for useful discussion of\nartificial creativity, including many additional examples of\nparticular cases, and so-called Dartmouth-based Turing tests). If we\nemploy this test, we might find ourselves with an unexpected\nconclusion: computers can be creative; in fact, some of them already\nare. But one might reasonably worry that the test is inadequate and\nthe conclusion is too quick (Berrar & Schuster 2014; Bringsjord et\nal. 2001). From the fact that a computer operates as if\nit\u2019s creative, one might argue, it doesn\u2019t follow that it\nreally is. Which brings us to our next question:\n\n\nStrong AC: Could a computer genuinely be\ncreative?\n\n\n\nThis obviously returns us to the question of what conditions something\nmust meet in order to count as being genuinely creative. And here we\nneed go beyond the outwardly observable product-features of novelty\nand value to consider the underlying processes of genuine creativity.\nAs we saw in\n \u00a72.2,\n theorists have variously proposed that in order for a process to\ncount as creative, it must be surprising, original,\nspontaneous, and/or agential. There is no consensus to\nappeal to here, but if any one of these conditions is indeed\nrequired for genuine creativity, then a computer could be genuinely\ncreative only to the extent that it executes processes which satisfy\nthat condition.\n\nThe classic statement of skepticism regarding the possibility of\ncomputer creativity is due to Lady Ada Lovelace who had this to say\nwhile remarking on \u201cthe Analytical Engine\u201d designed by her\nfriend Charles Babbage:\n\n\nIt is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas\nthat might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The\nAnalytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate\nanything. (Lovelace 1843, italics added)\n\n\nThough Lovelace does not frame her comments in terms of\n\u201ccreativity\u201d as such, she explicitly denied that a\ncomputer could satisfy at least one condition that is plausibly\nrequired for creativity, namely originality. A computer\ncannot be the originator, the author, or the creator of anything new,\nshe contends; it can only do what it is programmed to do. We cannot\nget anything out of a computer that has not already been programmed\ninto it. Further, Lovelace may also be interpreted as expressing or\nimplying doubt about whether a computer could satisfy the three other\nproposed requirements for genuine creativity. Insofar as a\ncomputer\u2019s outputs cannot be original, one might also suspect\nthat they cannot be surprising. The image of a machine\nstrictly following rules invokes precisely the kind of mechanical\nprocedure that is the antithesis of spontaneity. And it may\nseem that such a machine could not be a genuine agent either.\nThe problem isn\u2019t just that a computer can\u2019t produce\nanything original; it\u2019s that it deserves no credit for whatever\nit does produce. Any praise or blame for the outputs of a computer\nrightly go to the engineers and programmers who made the machine, not\nto the machine itself. While these points may be intuitive, at least\nsome of them are being challenged by modern technologies, which have\ncome a long way since Babbage\u2019s invention.\n\nConsider AlphaGo again. This is a \u201cdeep learning\u201d system,\nwhich involves two neural networks: a Policy network and a Value\nnetwork. Very briefly: The system is trained using a vast number of\nlegitimate moves made in actual games of Go played by professional\nhuman players (28.4 million moves from 160,000 games, to be precise;\nsee Silver et al. 2016 and Halina 2021). The network is further\ntrained, again using learning algorithms, by playing many games (some\n100 million) against previous versions of itself (in the sense of a\ndifferently weighted neural network). The weights of nodes in the\nnetwork are then adjusted by a learning algorithm that favors moves\nmade in winning games. The value network is trained over a subset of\nthese many games, with node weighting adjustments resulting in\nreliable probability assignments to moves vis-\u00e0-vis their\npotential to contribute to a win. Finally, the system employs a\nMonte Carlo search tree (MCT). Generally, this kind of\nalgorithm is designed to simulate a decision process to optimize\nsuccess given chosen parameters. In this case, the search algorithm\nselects a given path of moves, then adds some valid moves to this\npath, and then if this process does not terminate (end in win/loss),\nthe system performs a \u201crollout\u201d. A rollout essentially\nplays the game out for both players (using samples of possible moves)\nto its conclusion. The information that results from the MCT and\nprocessing by the value network are then fed back (back propagated)\ninto the system. This entire process (once the system is trained) is\nrapid and determines how AlphaGo \u201cdecides\u201d to move in any\ngiven game.\n\nHere are some things to note. AlphaGo\u2019s style of play is\nsurprising. As commentators have noted, it is starkly\nunconventional relative to standards of human play (Halina cites Baker\nand Hui 2017\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Indeed, Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player defeated by AlphaGo\nin 2016, remarked that AlphaGo\u2019s play revealed that much of\nhuman play is, contrary to prior common opinion, not creative after\nall\u2014intimating that at least some of the play of AlphaGo\nis. Note further that this system is flexible. While there\nare learning algorithms and rules that adjust network weights, the\nsystem is not mechanical or predictable in the same fashion as\nearlier, classical systems (including Deep Blue, for\nexample). In a recent paper, Marta Halina has made this argument\n(Halina 2021). She explicitly invokes Boden\u2019s characterization,\nwhich requires novelty, value, and surprise of creativity. Again, the\nnovelty and value should be plausibly attributed in this case.\nRegarding surprise, Halina suggests that it is AlphaGo\u2019s\nemployment of MCT that enables a kind of \u201cinsight\u201d,\nflexibility, and unpredictable results. She writes,\n\n\nIt is the exploration parameter that allows AlphaGo to go beyond its\ntraining, encouraging it to simulate moves outside of those\nrecommended by the policy network. As the search tree is constructed,\nthe system starts choosing moves with the highest \u201caction\nvalue\u201d to simulate, where the action value indicates how good a\nmove is based on the outcome of rollouts and value-network\nevaluations. (Halina 2021: 324)\n\n\nHalina grants that given its domain-specificity, as we have already\nnoted, this system\u2019s particular abilities do not generalize in a\nway that may be required to properly attribute genuine intelligence.\nBut she suggests that the complex use of the MCT search may amount to\n\u201cmental scenario building\u201d or, we might say, a kind of\nimagination. And insofar as this search algorithm technology can be\napplied to other systems in other domains, and imagination is a\ngeneral component of intelligence, perhaps here lies space for\ngeneralizability. AlphaGo also affords at least some reply to the\ntraditional Lovelace worry.\n\n\nArtificial systems do not act only according to preprogrammed rules\nhand-coded by engineers. Moreover, current deep-learning methods are\ncapable of producing systems that are superhuman in their abilities to\ndiscover novel and valuable solutions to problems within specific\ndomains. (Halina 2021: 327)\n\n\nIf this is right, then AlphaGo exhibits originality. Finally,\nthe flexibility with which this system operates may also satisfy\nKronfeldner\u2019s spontaneity requirement.\n\nSome of these same features are found in a related approach in AI,\nnamely research in evolutionary robotics. These systems also involve\nvarious forms of machine learning but in this case the learning is\ndistributed, as it were, across a population of individuals rather\nthan one individual. This approach can be understood, albeit\nimperfectly, as analogous to natural evolution. One begins, typically\nin computer simulation, with a population of agents. These agents are\ntypically identified with individual neural networks, the connections\nand weightings of which are random to start. Relative to some\ntask\u2014for instance, avoiding obstacles, collecting objects,\nperforming photo or phonotaxis\u2014a genetic algorithm\nassigns a fitness value to each individual agent after a certain\nperiod of time or number of trials. Fitter agents are typically\nfavored and used to generate the next population of agents. Also\nincluded in this generation are random mutation and\ngenetic crossover (digital breeding!). Although it can take\nhundreds of generations, this is a discovery approach to engineering\nor constructing a system that successfully performs a task; it is\n\u201cgradient descent learning\u201d (Clark 1996). In this\nbottom-up approach, no single individual, nor even an entire\npopulation, are in any strict sense programmed. Rather, successful\nagents have \u201clearned\u201d as a result of generations of\nrandomness, crossover, and small fitness improvements (and lots and\nlots of failures). Early success cases evolved robots that can follow\ntrails (Koza 1992), locomote in insect-fashion (Beer & Gallagher\n1992), guide themselves visually (Cliff, Husbands, & Harvey 1993),\nand collect garbage (Nolfi & Floreana 2000). See Bird and Stokes\n(2006, 2007) and Stokes and Bird (2008) for analysis and study of\ncreativity in the context of evolutionary robotics.\n\nThese systems most certainly produce novelty. Later, fit individuals\nachieve novelty at their aimed task relative to whole generations and\npopulations of previous agents. And this novelty is often surprising\nto the engineers and programmers that build them, indeed sometimes\neven unpredictably independent of any relevant task for individuals in\nthe population. There are many examples in the literature. Indeed\nLehman and others (2020) catalog a large range of cases where digital\nevolution surprises its creators, categorizing them in four\nrepresentative groups: \u201cmis-specified fitness functions\u201d,\n\u201cunintended debugging\u201d, \u201cexceeded experimenter\nexpectations\u201d, and \u201cconvergence with biology\u201d. Here\nis one now relatively famous example of the first type of case. In\nearly research in artificial life (A-Life), Karl Sims (1994) designed\nvirtual creatures that were supposed to learn to walk (as well as swim\nand jump) in a simulated environment. The fitness function assessed\nindividual agents on their average ground velocity across 10 seconds.\nSome of the fittest individuals to evolve were surprising: they grew\ntall and rigid and when they would fall over they would achieve high\nground velocity, thus maximizing fitness given the (mis)specified\nparameters in unpredicted ways.\n\nThis is but one example of how systems like these can evolve in\nunpredictable or surprising ways. This unpredictability has\noccurred not just in simulated robotics, but in embodied robotics as\nwell. In using a genetic algorithm to attempt to evolve oscillating\nsensors, researchers unintentionally evolved a radio antenna (Bird\n& Layzell 2002). This unexpected result arose from a combination\nof the particular algorithm used (which was intended) and various\nphysical features of the space such as proximity to a PC monitor\n(which the researchers had presumably deemed irrelevant but which the\nevolved system, in a sense, did not). And one might be further\ninclined to describe some of these achievements as creative (and not\njust in the trivial sense that they are original instances of robotic\nsuccess), since they also produce value, at least insofar as they are\nuseful at performing a task, whether it is locomoting or locating a\nsource of light or sensing radio waves.\n\nSome theorists in this domain might argue that these systems achieve\nspontaneity as well. Given the substantial inclusion of\nrandomness in the system\u2019s development\u2014both at the outset\nwhen the individual\u2019s neural networks are randomized and more\nimportantly with random mutation across populations\u2014it is\nintuitive to describe the system\u2019s as not following a\nmechanical procedure. Indeed, the way in which systems exploit fitness\nfunctions and data patterns further underscores this point. (Again,\nsee the rich catalog of cases offered by Lehman et al. 2020).\n\nOn the face of it, then, recent technologies in AI, evolutionary\nrobotics, and artificial life, seem to fulfill many of the conditions\nproposed for genuine creativity. These systems produce things that are\nnovel and valuable, and do so through computational processes that are\nplausibly surprising, original, and spontaneous. The one requirement\nwe have yet to address, however, is agency. Recall the\nsuggestion, implicit in Lovelace\u2019s remarks, that whatever a\ncomputer produces is to the credit of the programmer, not the\ncomputer. Notice that as sophisticated as current technologies in\nartificial creativity may be, presumably they are still not subject to\npraise or blame for what they do. If any beings are responsible for\nthe work of these programs, it still seems to be the programmers and\nengineers who make them, not the programs themselves. The programs\nthemselves do not seem to \u201cgive a damn\u201d. So, if the\ncreative process requires agency, arguably we have not yet created,\nprogrammed, or evolved a computational system that is really creative,\nhowever much they might appear to be. In the pursuit of strong AC,\nagency might be the final frontier (Paul & Stokes 2021).\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt should be clear from the above discussions that there are rich and\nlively research programs, across a range of scientific disciplines,\nstudying human creativity. These approaches substantiate the view\nthat, contrary to the romantic tradition, creativity can be explained.\nPsychological functions and neural correlates have been identified,\nand remarkable advances are being made with computational and robotics\ntechnologies. What may be less clear is that, despite these advances,\nthe distinct research programs in question are largely disjoint or\nsiloed.\n\nIn a recent paper, Geraint Wiggins and Joydeep Bhattacharya (2014)\nhighlight this \u201cgap\u201d between scientific studies of\ncreativity. Their particular emphasis is on the gaps between research\nin neuroscience and research in computer science, and they advocate a\nbridge in the form of a neurocomputational approach. This kind of\nbridging may be called for even beyond what these authors prescribe,\nsince there are gaps not just between these disciplines, but also\nbetween these and behavioral psychology, AI and A-Life research, and\nphilosophical analysis. Creativity is a deeply complex and deeply\nimportant phenomenon. Fully understanding it will require us to\nintegrate a variety of theoretical perspectives, and, as this survey\nreveals, philosophy has a vital role to play in that endeavor.",
