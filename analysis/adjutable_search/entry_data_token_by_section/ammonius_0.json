    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nAmmonius\u2019 father Hermeias, after studying in Athens under\nSyrianus (Head of School in Athens 431/2\u2013437), returned to Alexandria,\nwhere he established the teaching of Platonism as an additional\nsubject in the school of Horapollo (see below), alongside the\nprincipal curriculum in rhetoric. Ammonius\u2019 mother Aedesia had\nbeen chosen as a young girl by Syrianus, a relative of hers, to marry\nProclus, who would succeed their teacher Syrianus as head on the\nlatter\u2019s death in 437. When Proclus was kept from marrying her\nby \u2018some god\u2019, Aedesia was then married to Proclus\u2019\nfellow student Hermeias. From these details, it is clear that\nAmmonius, second of three sons of Hermeias and Aedesia (the eldest died in childhood), must have been born\nafter about 435, presumably not long before 445. He seems to have been\ndead when Damascius (ca. 460-after 532) was writing his Life of\nIsidore or Philosophical History in 526, but alive in\n517, when his course on Aristotle\u2019s Physics was first\npublished by Philoponus.\n\nDamascius, whose Life of Isidore is the source of most\ndetails about Ammonius\u2019 life, greatly admired Aedesia for her\npiety and charity, and while still a young student of rhetoric he gave\nher eulogy at Horapollo\u2019s school. Although the municipal stipend\nwhich had been paid to Hermeias (presumably as a teacher) continued to\nbe given her after Hermeias\u2019 death, from the time Ammonius and\nhis younger brother Heliodorus were small until their maturity,\nDamascius says that Aedesia\u2019s charitable giving left her sons in\ndebt on her death in old age (ca. 475, since Damascius, still a boy\nand a student of rhetoric, was honored to give her eulogy, ornamented\nwith heroic hexameters). These financial straits may have something to\ndo with Damascius\u2019 opinion that Ammonius was viciously greedy:\nwith this debt, he would certainly have striven to keep teaching and\ncollecting salary and fees; however, the preserved excerpts of\nDamascius do not make this connection, perhaps in order to portray\nAmmonius as simply greedy (see below, on Ammonius\u2019 alleged\n\u2018deal\u2019 with the Christian Bishop of Alexandria). For\nDamascius the true offspring of this union of this exceptionally moral\nand holy couple was Aedesia and Hermeias\u2019 eldest child, blessed\nwith divine gifts, who died at age seven and receives a rather\nhagiographic description. Aedesia accompanied her two surviving sons\nto Athens, where, at her suggestion, both studied with Proclus.\n\nAedesia and her sons must have returned before 475 from their study in\nAthens under Proclus to Alexandria, where Ammonius began lecturing on\nphilosophy at the school of Horapollon. We have reports of lectures on\nPlato by Ammonius from the beginning and end of his career. Sometime\nbetween 475 and 485 Damascius, who studied under Ammonius and his\nbrother Heliodorus, heard Ammonius lecture on Platonic philosophy;\nabout 515 Olympiodorus heard him lecture on the Gorgias\n(Olympiodorus, in Gorg. 199,8\u201310). Asclepius mentions\nlectures (or seminars: sunousiai, in Met. 77,4) on\nPlato and refers to an \u2018exegesis\u2019 (in Met. 70,31)\nof the Theaetetus. Nonetheless, Damascius reports that\nAmmonius was better versed in Aristotle, and it is his lectures on\nAristotle which, for the most part, have been transmitted to us.\n\nIn Ammonius\u2019 day, Alexandria, unlike Athens, was an important\ncenter of Christian cult and culture, the third See of Christendom.\nThe school founded by Horapollo, where after Hermeias joined it the\ntwo main courses of study were rhetoric and philosophy, was a hub of\nthe \u2018Hellenic\u2019 pagan learning, religion and culture.\nApparently, Christian professors taught there as well, however, though\nthe latter tended to lecture in their homes on Fridays, leaving the\nschool largely to the pagans on that day (Zacharias, Life of\nSeverus p. 23 Kugener); certainly, there were Christian students\nin the classes of both their co-religionists and the Hellenes. The\natmosphere in Ammonius\u2019 classroom is (too?) vividly portrayed in\nAmmonius or On the Creation of the World, written by one such\nChristian student, Zacharias of Maiuma (Gaza\u2019s port-city), the\nlater Bishop of Mytilene, who studied with Ammonius in Alexandria\nbetween 485 and 487. Zacharias\u2019 book recounts discussions\nbetween \u2018The Christian\u2019, presumably Zacharias himself, and\n\u2018Ammonius\u2019 in front of the classroom; there is also\n(perhaps added later, after Ammonius\u2019 death: Watts 2005) a\ndiscussion with the medical philosopher (iatrosophist\u0113s)\nGesius, said to have been Ammonius\u2019 best student at the time.\nThis recounting of the \u2018dialogues in the Platonic manner\u2019\n(1. 7\u20138) should not be taken as historical: it is embellished by\nZacharias with various references to Platonic dialogues and their digs\nat sophists; the arguments themselves largely depend upon another\ncontemporary work, the Theophrastus by Aeneas of Gaza, which\nhas no express connection with Ammonius. But Zacharias portrays\nAmmonius\u2019 classroom as a battle over the souls of a mixture of\ncommitted pagans and Christians, and some students leaning one way or\nthe other. Zacharias\u2019 contempt for Ammonius and for Platonic\nphilosophy is evident, and their discussion ends with Ammonius\u2019\nembarrassed silence. That the school could be a focus of hostile\nChristian attention had been made abundantly clear by the lynching of\nHypatia at the hands of an Alexandrian mob in 415. Questions thus\narise about the relation of the school to what Damascius in his\nLife of Isidore calls \u2018the dominant doctrine\u2019.\nHow did the school manage to keep going as a largely pagan institution\nin a strongly Christian city? Did the philosophers in the school make\nany concessions, doctrinal or otherwise, to the Christian authorities?\nWas the school enabled to continue teaching Platonic philosophy with\nsome pagan professors into the 530\u2019s by a concession of\nAmmonius\u2019 to the Christian authorities?\n\nIt has been speculated that Ammonius may actually have converted to\nChristianity. A remark in Philoponus\u2019 edition of Ammonius\u2019\nlectures on De Anima (104,21\u201323) to the effect that the\nsoul could be forced to profess tyrants\u2019 impious dogma, but\ncould not be forced to assent to it and believe it, might perhaps go\nback to Ammonius and has been taken as possible evidence that he was\ncoerced to pay lip service to Christianity, as has the dialectically\ncoerced admission (2.1094\u20131121) of Zacharias\u2019 character\n\u2018Ammonius\u2019 that the Trinity really is\n\u201cthree in hypostasis and being, but one in number\u201d\n(Westerink 1962, XI\u2013XII and Cameron 1969,14\u201315). But there\nis no convincing evidence of a conversion (cf. Blumenthal 1986,\n322\u2013323), nor of any change in the real Ammonius\u2019\nteaching. \n\nAmmonius\u2019 tenure at the school saw a large-scale attack on the\npagan community of Alexandria in the wake of the revolt of Illus\n(484\u2013488) against the Emperor Zeno, during which harsh measures\nwere taken against the pagans by the Patriarch Peter III Mongus\n(482\u2013489), since Illus had allied himself with the corrupt pagan\nPamprepius and may have promised him that pagan practice would be\ntolerated. It was probably during this crisis that Ammonius is\nrepresented by Damascius as making an agreement or deal:\n\u201cAmmonius, who was wickedly greedy and saw everything in terms\nof any profit he could make, concluded an agreement\n(sunth\u0113kas) with the overseer (episkopounta,\ni.e., bishop) of the dominant doctrine\u201d (Photius, Bibl.\ncod. 242.352a 11\u201314=Damascius 118B Athanassiadi; cf. her Intro.\n30\u20131 and n. 37). Scholarly attention has focused on the nature\nof Ammonius\u2019 \u2018deal\u2019 with the Bishop (presumed, by\nconnecting this persecution with the end of Illus\u2019 revolt, to\nhave been Peter Mongus; the appearance of the name of his successor,\nAthanasius II [490\u2013497] in a doublet of the same passage from\nDamascius [Photius, Bibl. cod. 242.347a 20] is apparently an\nintrusive, mistaken gloss). The suggestions have been put forward that\nhe agreed to continue the alleged Alexandrian Neoplatonic practice of\nmaking the gods into one by collapsing the One into the Intellect (a\nview congenial to Christianity); or that he agreed to lecture only on\nAristotle, avoiding Plato, or not to mention in his teaching the\nAristotelian doctrine of the eternity and divinity of the world; or\nthat he betrayed the hiding places of colleagues and pupils. Scholars\nhave adduced counterevidence against the first three suggestions,\nconcerning the school\u2019s doctrine. That Ammonius betrayed his\nfellow Hellenes is a speculation based on his ability\u2014alone\namong the major figures of the school\u2014to resume his teaching\nunscathed after the turmoil of 489, on Damascius\u2019 association of\nAmmonius\u2019 deal with a profit motive, and also on\nDamascius\u2019 hints that Ammonius was unprincipled and given to\nintrigue, as evidenced by an earlier power-struggle against Erythrius\n(a three-time praetorian prefect) in Constantinople (Damascius 78E;\nAthanassiadi 1999, 30\u20132). Indeed, the excerpts from Damascius\nseem to indicate that Ammonius was a prime target of the investigation\nand persecution led by the imperial envoy Nicomedes, who in an attempt\nto get information on \u201cthe Ammonius affair\u201d (Damascius\n117A) ordered the arrest of Ammonius\u2019 friend Harpocras, a\nprofessor of literature; he fled, but the order led to the arrest and\ntorture of Horapollo and Hera\u00efscus, whom they tried to make\ninform on Harpocras and Isidore (Damascius 117B). Thus, Damascius\nperhaps implies that Ammonius set the investigators on Harpocras to\ndraw them away from himself. \n\nRichard Sorabji (1990b, 12; see also 2005; 2016b, xiii\u2013xiv;\n2016c, 46\u201347) suggested that Ammonius might have agreed not to\nallow the school to be a center of pagan and theurgic ritual, which he\nwould also de-emphasize in his teaching, or simply not to make trouble\nwith Christians, as the practice of theurgy or any attempt to convert\nChristian students to it would do. On Sorabji\u2019s thesis, instead\nof agreeing with Iamblichus\u2019 insistence on theurgy as\nindispensable to reaching spiritual union with God, a doctrine largely\ntaken over by Proclus (on Proclus\u2019 theurgy and its three types,\nsee Sheppard 1982), Ammonius sided\nwith Porphyry\u2019s refusal to accept the efficacy of theurgy in\npurifying the intellect and hence leading us to God. This\ninterpretation puts Ammonius in an altogether better light than does\nDamascius\u2019, which is approved by Athanassiadi. For Sorabji his\nfinancial gain was the continuation of his municipal salary, so that\nhe could keep his school open, rather than a craven payment for\nservices rendered to the Christian authorities; he did not betray his\nfriends; he did not betray philosophy, since he merely preferred the\nnoncommittal attitude of Porphyry in the matter of divine names and\ntheurgy to that of Iamblichus and Proclus; on the contrary, he saved\nphilosophy in Alexandria.\n\nSorabji\u2019s conjecture has attained something like a consensus\namong scholars (e.g., Hadot 2015, 29) and is quite possibly correct.\nThere is still room for doubt, however. It is not clear that Ammonius\nand his school rejected or downplayed theurgy; Olympiodorus (in\nPhd., Lect. 8, sec. 2) puts theurgy on the highest level of\nvirtue: philosophy can make us Intellect, while theurgy can unite us\nwith the intelligibles, so that we act paradeigmatically (cf. Blank\n2010, 659\u2013660). Still, as Sorabji says (2016c, 47), he\napparently addressed his students as if they were all Christians, and\nwithout the volatile mix of pagans, Christians, and those who were\nwavering, the danger of Ammonius\u2019 day was absent; Ammonius would\nhave had much more reason to agree to keep theurgy out of his\nclassroom after the riots of 486 and persecution of 489. If on the\nbasis of its absence from his commentaries on Aristotle we say that\nAmmonius de-emphasized theurgy or kept it to himself, he appears to\nhave done so consistently throughout his career, so that this cannot\nbe used as evidence of any forced change in his teaching. Did he,\nthen, agree to continue doing what he had been doing all along?\nPerhaps the mere fact of Ammonius\u2019 willingness to approach and\nmake an agreement with Peter was enough to justify the disdain of\nDamascius.\n\nCan we ascertain Ammonius\u2019 attitude to theurgy and\n\u2018Egyptian\u2019 or \u2018Hellenic\u2019 rites? Beyond the\ncommentaries we have three quasi-historical sources for Ammonius:\nDamascius\u2019 Life of Isidore and Zacharias\u2019\nLife of Severus and Ammonius. In narrating the early\nlife of Severus (Bishop of Antioch 512\u2013518, though he was a\npagan during his student days at Alexandria in the 480\u2019s),\nZacharias recounts the story of Paralius, a student in\nHorapollo\u2019s school undecided between paganism and Christianity\n(see Watts 2005). In 486 after taunting the philosopher Asclepiodotus\nfor his claim to have got his hitherto infertile wife pregnant by\nEgyptian magic, Paralius was set upon and beaten by the Hellenic\nstudents of the school on a Friday, when the Christians were largely\nabsent. This incident resulted in complaints to Entrechius the Prefect\nand to the Bishop, Peter Mongus, leading to the ransacking of the\nsanctuary of Isis at Menouthis and the burning of many hieratic cult\nobjects. The professors of the school accused in this incident were\nHorapollon himself, along with the \u2018philosophers\u2019\nAsclepiodotus, Hera\u00efscus, Ammonius, and Isidore. Nothing further\nis said about Hera\u00efscus or Ammonius; Zacharias had already\nridiculed Asclepiodotus, who subsequently repaired to Aphrodisias, and\nhe remarks that Isidore was later revealed as a magician and\ntroublemaker. Thus, Zacharias associates Ammonius with colleagues whom\nhe generally labels philosophers and adherents of the Egyptian\nmysteries, but gives us no particulars about him. In his Life of\nSeverus, Zacharias focused on the conflicts between Alexandrian\npagans and Christians, showing the winning and salvific force of\nChristianity. In the Ammonius he portrayed the superiority of\nChristian doctrine, especially that the world was created, and the\ndialectical victories of a Christian student over the more\nphilosophically experienced pagans Ammonius and Gesios. Therefore,\nthat book avoids the cultic conflict altogether and tells us nothing\nabout Ammonius relating to theurgic belief or ritual. \n\nDamascius and his hero Isidore, on the other hand, were fervent\nadherents of theurgy and practitioners of hieratic ritual, and\nDamascius\u2019 cast of characters are divided into those who\npracticed such ritual (good), those who were especially divinely\ngifted (better), and those whose participation was nil or is passed\nover in silence (bad guys); Ammonius is among the latter. The same was\nnot true of his family, however, as Damascius saw them. Hadot (2015,\n1\u201314) argues for the importance of religiosity and theurgy in the\nAlexandrian, as well as in the Athenian, school. Plutarch, who\nintroduced Iamblichean Platonism into Athens, had three famous\nstudents: Hierocles, Syrianus, and Proclus. Of the first two,\nAlexandrians by birth, Hierocles, author of a book on the Pythagorean\nGolden Verses, returned to teach in his native city, while\nSyrianus was chosen by Plutarch to succeed him. Proclus was younger\nthan these. Born in Byzantium and raised in Lycian Xanthos, convinced\nthat his Alexandrian teachers did not read Plato in the true spirit of\nthe philosopher and mindful of the divine vision and calling he had\nreceived in Xanthos (Marinus, Life of Proclus 10)\u2014not\nthe last gift he would receive from the gods\u2014he left Alexandria\nfor Athens. Hermeias studied with Syrianus; his commentary on the\nPhaedrus cites the Chaldaean Oracles and Orphic\nHymns frequently. Hermeias\u2019 wife Aedesia not only\nshared her husband\u2019s virtuous character, she was \u201cso pious\ntoward God and holy and, to tell the whole of it, beloved of the gods\nthat she was accorded many epiphanies\u201d (Damascius, Life of\nIsidore 56). Indeed, the first child born to the couple was a boy\nof such wondrous qualities and virtue that he departed this life at\nage seven, \u201cunable to bear his embodied existence\u201d\n(Life of Isidore 57A). As for Ammonius himself, we have seen\nhim listed (Zacharias, Life of Severus 16 and 22) as one of\nthe four philosophy teachers associated with the philologist\n(grammatikos) Horapollon and mocked for their adherence to\nthe pagan gods. Of these, Asclepiodotus and Isidore were explicitly\nconnected by Zacharias with Egyptian religion and magic. Damascius\n(Life of Isidore 81) describes how Asclepiodotus was saved\nfrom drowning by divine intervention, \u201csuch was his divine\npower, even while he was still embodied\u201d. Hera\u00efscus he\ndescribes as having a divine nature and living in such a way that his\nsoul dwelt as much as possible among shrines and places of initiation\n(Life of Isidore 72A, B). Of the four, then, only about\nAmmonius does Damascius report nothing regarding theurgy, mysteries,\nor holiness. Is this an accurate picture, or is Damascius\u2019\nsilence as malicious as his words? \n\nAmmonius\u2019 \u2018deal\u2019 with the Bishop is attested only by\nDamascius, who despises Ammonius. Although he could have connected\nAmmonius\u2019 agreement with his debts, Damascius chose instead to\nemphasize his greed, blackening his character with a trait\n(aischrokerd\u0113s) which Plato had said (Republic\n408c3\u20134) would be incompatible with the demigod Asclepius\u2019\ndivinity, if shown in his medical practice; it must be equally bad for\nAmmonius in his profession. As Photius already reports, Damascius\nalways mixed praise for some traits with blame for others in each\nperson he reports on. He also plays characters one against the other\n(cf. O\u2019Meara 2006). Damascius prepared his claim about\nAmmonius\u2019 greed by his idealization of Hermeias, who even told\nmerchants that their wares were priced too low (Damascius 54), and of\nAedesia, whose continuation of her husband\u2019s charitable giving\nput the family into debt, and of the couple\u2019s saintly eldest son\n(Damascius 56). The respect and love which Ammonius\u2019 parents\nearned from both philosophers and the masses form an implicit contrast\nto the conflict surrounding Ammonius and his greed. The rhetorical\nstructure of Damascius\u2019 narrative thus casts doubt on any\n\u2018deal\u2019 between Ammonius and the Bishop, which may have\nbeen the result of pure speculation on Damascius\u2019 part, combined\nwith his animus toward Ammonius (see Blank 2010, 657\u2013660).\nDamascius actually admits (120B) making such an inference in the case\nof Horapollon, who he says deserted to \u2018the others\u2019, a\nconversion that \u201che apparently chose on his own, not compelled\nby any misfortune, perhaps too from the demands of an insatiable\ngreed; for it is not easy to propose any other reason to excuse his\nconversion\u201d. \n\nIs a deal with the Bishop necessary to explain Ammonius\u2019\ncontinued ability to teach in Alexandria? The other professors of\nphilosophy appear to have fled or died during Nicomedes\u2019\ninvestigation in 489, while Ammonius, initially a focus of that\ninvestigation, remained in Alexandria. We are not told that it became\nimpossible for pagans other than Ammonius to teach after 489, and\nthere were evidently Christian students in Ammonius\u2019 school\nafter that date, just as there were earlier. Since Damascius connects\nAmmonius\u2019 deal with his avarice, we should like to know more\nabout his income. In major cities, the role of teacher was associated\nwith payment by the city, and in Constantinople there were chairs paid\nby the Emperor; a law of Justinian in 529, the extension of an order\nof his father (Justin I, 518\u2013527), decrees (Codex Justinianus\n1.5.18.4) that only those of orthodox faith may teach and receive a\npublic stipend (sit\u0113sis d\u0113mosia). Damascius reports\nthat Hermeias had received a municipal stipend, presumably for\nteaching, which his widow managed to have continued until her sons\ncould do philosophy (h\u014ds ephilosoph\u0113san, where h\u014ds is used in the sense of he\u014ds).\nScholars mostly think this makes it likely that Ammonius took up his\nfather\u2019s position on his return from Athens, or even that his\nfather\u2019s position in the school was held vacant for him and was\npaid in the meanwhile. But there were at least four philosophers\nteaching together with Horapollon in the 480s, so it is difficult to\nassert that Ammonius held \u2018the chair\u2019 of philosophy;\nperhaps there were a number of \u2018chairs\u2019\u2014difficult,\nbut not impossible, since Ammonius was undoubtedly the most important\nand influential of the four. How long did Aedesia continue to receive\nher dead husband\u2019s salary for her sons, \u201cuntil they began\nto do philosophy\u201d (h\u014ds ephilosoph\u0113san): was\nit until they could receive it in their own right? Damascius uses the\naorist tense of philosophe\u014d to mean \u2018studied\nphilosophy\u2019 (54 Hermeias studied philosophy under Syrianus; 57B\nAmmonius and Heliodorus studied philosophy under Proclus; 71B Isidore\nstudied philosophy under the brothers Hera\u00efscus and Asclepiades;\ncf. 63B while Hierios was studying [philosophounta]\nphilosophy). On that likely reading, Aedesia will have arranged for\nher sons to be supported by the city until she could take them to\nAthens to study philosophy, where they would, as members of the\nAcademy community, have been supported. When they returned to\nAlexandria, they will have made their own way, with the support of\ntheir mother and of family friends; whether with financial support\nfrom students, from the city, or both, is unclear. \n\nHadot (2015, 23\u201325) thinks that Zacharias\u2019 account proves that\nHorapollon\u2019s school was a private institution when Ammonius\ntaught there and that it is highly unlikely that a pagan philosopher\ncould have received a municipal salary in Alexandria in\nAmmonius\u2019 day, due to Christian hostility. She argues Ammonius\nand his colleagues will have relied on students\u2019 fees for their\nincome and therefore been more vulnerable than their Athenian\ncolleagues, who lived communally, supported by the wealth of the\nAcademy, which stemmed from bequests of the pious and learned\n(Life of Isidore 102). Support for this may come from\nOlympiodorus, who says (in Gorg. 43.2, 224.20\u201324; 43.4,\n225.19\u201321; 43.6, 226.24\u201326) that philosophers will receive the merited\nthanks of their students for their help and must therefore not ask\nthem for fees (misthous); but this is a hoary philosophical\nclich\u00e9 (cf. Xenophon, Mem. 1.2.6\u20138). In his\narticle on the complex of lecture rooms excavated in Alexandria,\nSorabji (2014, 36\u201337) points to the size of the establishment and its\nrebuilding and expansion after the earthquake of 535 as indications of\ngenerous municipal support. It may well be that Christian Alexandria\ncontinued to support the teaching of pagan philosophers because they\nhad an audience of students. There were still pagan students and those\nleaning toward paganism in the city. But Christians too will have been\ndrawn to the high reputation of pagan Greek literature and philosophy.\nChristian students will also have sought the kind of dialectical\nskills taught by pagan philosophers and rhetoricians, along with their\nadvanced logical and metaphysical teachings, the better to argue\nagainst them and the better to understand the philosophical basis of\ntheir own Christian faith (cf. Wildberg 2005, 234\u2013236). After all,\nZacharias stayed in Alexandria a year after Severus left to study law\nat Berytus because he needed further study of the rhetoricians and\nphilosophers, so as to fight the pagans, who were so proud of them,\nwith their own weapons (Life of Severus 46; cf. Champion\n2014, 31\u201332). \n",
