    "main_text": "Objections to Case-Based Logical Pluralism || The Normativity Objection\n2.2 The Normativity Objection\n\nA different objection to pluralism (sometimes also referred to as the\nCollapse Argument) starts from the premise that logic is\nnormative, where this means that logics have consequences for\nhow we ought to reason, i.e., for what we ought to believe, and for\nhow we ought to update our beliefs when we learn new things. Many\nwriters have thought that logic is normative, sometimes because they\nhave thought that logic just is the science of good\nreasoning:\n\n\nIn Logic we do not want to know how the understanding is and thinks,\nand how it has hitherto proceeded in thinking, but how it ought to\nproceed in thinking. (Kant 1800 [1885: 4])\n\n\u2026logic is a normative subject: it is supposed to provide an\naccount of correct reasoning. (Priest 1979: 297)\n\n\nSometimes, though, philosophers have taken the position that\nwhether or not logic is about reasoning, its claims about\nlogical consequence have normative consequences for reasoning:\n\n\nRules for asserting, thinking, judging, inferring, follow from the\nlaws of truth. And thus one can very well speak of laws of thought\ntoo. (Frege 1918 [1956:\n 289\u201390])[5]\n\n\u2026logical consequence is normative. In an important sense, if an\nargument is valid, then you somehow go wrong if you accept the\npremises but reject the conclusion. (Beall & Restall 2006: 16)\n\n\nMany critics have stressed an apparent tension between the alleged\nnormativity of logic and the thesis of logical pluralism. Suppose, for\nexample that if an argument form is valid, then some normative\nconclusion follows concerning what we ought to believe. (Perhaps it is\nthat we ought to believe the conclusion of an instance of the argument\nform if we believe the premises, though much work on the normativity\nof logic suggests that it would need to be something substantially\nmore complicated.) Now suppose that logical pluralism is correct. In\nparticular logic 1, which says that disjunctive syllogism is valid,\nand logic 2, which says that disjunctive syllogism is not valid, are\nboth correct. Ought we to believe what logic 1 tells us to believe? It\nis hard to see how we could escape this obligation, given that logic 1\ntells us that the premises entail the conclusion, and logic 1 is\ncorrect. Yet if the normative consequence for belief does follow, then\nperhaps logic 2 is falling down in some respect\u2014it fails to\ncapture all of the obligations that follow from our logic. As Read\nputs it:\n\n\n[S]uppose there really are two equally good accounts of deductive\nvalidity, \\(K_1\\) and \\(K_2\\), that \\(\\beta\\) follows from \\(\\alpha\\)\naccording to \\(K_1\\) but not \\(K_2\\), and we know that \\(\\alpha\\) is\ntrue\u2026 It follows \\(K_1\\)-ly that\n\\(\\beta\\) is true, but not \\(K_2\\)-ly.\nShould we, or should we not conclude that \\(\\beta\\) is true? The\nanswer seems clear: \\(K_1\\) trumps \\(K_2\\) [because] \u2026 \\(K_1\\)\nanswers a crucial question which \\(K_2\\) does not\u2026 [This]\nquestion is the central question of logic. (Read 2006: 194\u2013195)\n\n\nVersions of the objection can also be found in Priest (2006), Keefe\n(2014: 1385), and Steinberger (2019). For pluralist responses, see\nCaret (2017), Russell (2017), Blake-Turner & Russell (2021) and\nBlake-Turner (2021). Stei (2020b) argues that the problem can\u2019t\nbe resolved by rejecting the normativity of logic.\n",
