    "main_text": "Self, identity, and liberty\n3. Self, identity, and liberty\n\nShaftesbury discusses self and identity throughout\nCharacteristicks. There are different views of how those\ndiscussions relate to traditional philosophical questions about\npersonal identity.\n\nIn The Moralists, Shaftesbury contends that there is no\nphysical or mental element that persists through a person\u2019s\nentire life, yet it seems that one can remain the same self even amid\nall those changes. A person is a single thing, retaining an identity\nthroughout the years. But that identity cannot consist of physical\nmatter, as every particle of a person changes over time. The\n\u2018Stuff \u2026 of which we are compos\u2019d\u2019, says\nTheocles, \u2018wears out in seven, or, at the longest, in twice\nseven Years, [as] the meanest Anatomist can tell us. Now where, I\nbeseech you, will that same One be found at last, supposing it\nto lie in the Stuff it-self, or any part of it? For when that\nis wholly spent, and not one Particle of it left, we are Our-selves\nstill as much as before\u2019 (C 2.350). Nor can a person\u2019s\nidentity be based on any idea or emotion, as all of a person\u2019s\nideas and emotions change as well. There\u2019s no single mental item\nthat has the constant existence that would be needed to fund a\nperson\u2019s identity. So since a person remains \u201cone and\nthe same, when neither one Atom of Body, one\nPassion, nor one Thought remains the same,\u201d his\nidentity must be based on \u201ca Sympathy of Parts\u201d (C 2.351).\nHis identity must consist of an overall organization, of a\n\u201csimple Principle: of which all the person\u2019s different\naspects partake (C 2.352).\n\nHume was dismissive of Shaftesbury\u2019s claims in The Moralists\nabout the identity, writing \u201dIf the reader is desirous to\nsee how a great genius may be influenc\u2019d by these seemingly\ntrivial principles of the imagination ... let him read my Lord\nShaftesbury\u2019s reasonings concerning the uniting principle\nof the universe, and the identity of plants and animals [in] his\nMoralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody: (Hume 1739\u201340:\n1.4.6.6). It seems, however, that Hume did learn something about\npersonal identity from The Moralists. For Hume\u2019s own\nview, like Shaftesbury\u2019s, relies on the idea that there is no\nsingle \u201cconstant and invariable\u201d mental item that can fund\npersonal identity: compare Hume\u2019s Treatise 1.4.6.2 and C\n2.350\u201351. Of course Hume and Shaftesbury draw opposite\nconclusions, with Shaftesbury moving from the premise that there is no\nconstant and invariable physical or mental item to the conclusion that\npersonal identity must consist of something other than a physical or\nmental item, and Hume moving to the conclusion that there is no\npersonal identity.\n\nThiel attributes to Shaftesbury the metaphysical position that the\nself, that which constitutes the identity of a person, is a simple\nimmaterial substance (Thiel 2011: 241\u20132). Jaffro distinguishes\n\u201cbetween a normative sense of \u2018being oneself\u2019 or\n\u2018remaining the same person\u2019, and the metaphysical sense,\nthat is, personal identity,\u201d and argues that Shaftesbury is more\nconcerned with the former (Jaffro 2014: 158). Winkler (2000) and\nPurviance (2004) pursue a similar line, arguing that Shaftesbury does\nnot intend to provide an answer to the metaphysical question of\npersonal identity. Shaftesbury\u2019s interest in selves and\nidentity, on this view, is practical rather than metaphysical. His\nconcern is to explain a sense of self and identify that is a moral\nachievement\u2014namely, the achievement of internal harmony of all\none\u2019s psychological principles, both at one moment and through\ntime. On these readings, the important point is that achieving this\nsynchronic and diachronic internal harmony ought to be a\nperson\u2019s fundamental goal, and Shaftesbury intends to give his\nreaders guidance on how to achieve it.\n\nJaffro (2014) and Boeker (2018) elaborate on the practical aspect of\nShaftesbury\u2019s view. Jaffro and Boeker both emphasize the\nimportance of self-control, where that involves the higher, reasonable\naspect of one\u2019s self determining one\u2019s actions rather than\nthe lower, appetites and passions (see also Crisp 2019: 88). Jaffro\ncontends that Shaftesbury has a three-stage position on the\nself-control a persistent practical self requires. The first stage is\na na\u00efve belief that one can simply decide to act from her higher\nprinciples and succeed at it. The second stage is an avoidance\nstrategy, which involves changing circumstances so that the lower\nappetites and passions cannot find room to play as large a role in\none\u2019s actions. The third stage is Stoic self-transformation,\nwhich involves changing one\u2019s soul so that appetites and\npassions no longer pull in a different direction from the higher\nparts. Jaffro suggests that Shaftesbury believes that the third stage\nof self-transformation is accessible only to the supremely\nintellectual few, and that most people can only aspire to the second\nstage of avoidance (see also Stuart-Buttle 2019: 102). Boeker argues,\nin contrast, that Shaftesbury believes that all humans can engage in a\njourney toward the third stage, and that Characteristicks is\nintended to exhort them along on that journey.\n\nClosely related to Shaftesbury\u2019s positions on identity and self\nare his views of personal liberty. There is dispute about whether\nShaftesbury advances a position on the philosophical question of free\nwill and determinism. His view of the laws of nature seem to suggest\nthat he believes in a determinist universe, but Grean (1967) suggests\nthat when he discusses evil he might be allowing a Pelagian exception\nfor free will. According to Grean, Shaftesbury \u201cargues that\nprovidence has granted us the power to know and obtain what is good,\nand to know and avoid what it is evil. It is up to us to make use of\nthese powers, to be men in the true sense\u2014autonomous\nagents of Deity itself\u201d (Grean 1967: 90; see also Axelsson 2019:\n189). Woldt believes, in contrast, that Shaftesbury holds a\ncompatibilist conception of free will (2014: 143\u20135). Boeker\n(2018) argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s texts do not include enough\nsubstances on the issue to attribute to him one position or another.\n(See also Crisp 2019: 78.)\n\nBoeker (2019) maintains that what Shaftesbury is interested in is\npositive freedom, or self-mastery. On this view, a person is free when\nshe acts from her highest and most reasonable principles, rather than\nher lower appetites and passions. Many parts of\nCharacteristicks do seem to involve this idea of a\nperson\u2019s comprising two competing parts. These includes the\nstory of Hercules choosing virtue over pleasure (C 3.347\u2013392),\nthe story of two brothers battling for a football (C 1.187), the\nself-dialogue of Soliloquy (C, 1.156-59), and the story of a\nnobleman who faces loss of control to sexual desire (C\n1.176\u201388). All these stories make the point that to be free is\nfor one\u2019s higher part to win out over one\u2019s lower part\n(see also Crisp 2019, 75\u201376).\n",
