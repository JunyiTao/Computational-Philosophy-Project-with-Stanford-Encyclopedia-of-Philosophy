Although\nsynthetic biology is distinct from systems biology in the explicit aim\nto design synthetic systems, it is often described as a practice\nrelying on systems biology as a theoretical foundation for design\n(Barrett et al. 2006).\n\nSynthetic and systems biology are sometimes described through the\ncomplementary aims of forward and reverse engineering. Forward\nengineering refers to the design of systems with novel functions,\noften by drawing on an existing high-level model (e.g., an existing\ncode or living cell). Forward engineering, or re-engineering, can lead\nto more complex systems, but simplicity may also be pursued through\nimplementation of a more abstract coding language or through reduction\nor rewiring of (genetic) circuits. Reverse engineering refers\nto the aim to understand the functioning of a system\n\u2018backwards\u2019 by examining an existing system in contexts\nwhere consulting a design protocol is not an option. The search for\nrecurring network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is an example of how systems biologists may reverse engineer the\nstructure of a system to understand its functional capacities. Because\nfunctional features such as robustness are not only important to the\nsurvival of organisms but also to design problems in engineering,\nreverse engineering of organizational features that underpin such\ncapacities is an important aim in both fields (Csete & Doyle 2002;\nHartwell et al. 1999; Kitano 2004; Stelling et al. 2004).\n\nReverse and forward engineering approaches may challenge the\nphilosophical perspective on how-possibly-models, which are often\ntaken to be stepping-stones for how-actually explanations. In systems\nand synthetic biology, however, how-possibly models can be explanatory\nin their own right - in explaining how possibly biological\nfunctions can be realized in natural or artificial systems (Green\n2015; Koskinen 2017). In engineering, reverse engineering is an\nactivity geared towards the identification of generic features of\nsystem design, or design principles, that can be reused in\nother systems. Similarly, reverse engineering in systems biology aims\nto identify biological design principles that can increase\nthe understanding of structure-function relations across different\nsystems (Csete & Doyle 2002; Doyle & Stelling 2006; Voit\n2003), and potentially also be used in the design of novel systems in\nsynthetic biology (Koskinen 2019).\n",
