    "main_text": "\n\nAlexius Meinong Ritter von Handschuchsheim (b. 1853, d. 1920) was an\nAustrian philosopher and psychologist who worked at the University of\nGraz from 1882 until his death. He initiated experimental psychology\nin Austria-Hungary by founding the first psychological laboratory\nthere in 1894. However, he became primarily renowned for the so called\ntheory of objects ([Gegenstandstheorie], 1904), a\nkind of a priori ontological account that introduces and\nconsiders systematically not only existent but also non-existent\nobjects. His approach is not only shaped by Franz Brentano\u2019s\ndescriptive psychology, a form of phenomenological philosophy, and its\nconnected notion of intentionality (directedness of mind), but also by\nthe British empiricists. Continuing and modifying Brentano\u2019s\nphilosophical teachings, Meinong provided important original\ncontributions to quite a few philosophical disciplines, most notably\nto ontology and metaphysics, value theory, epistemology, philosophical\npsychology, and philosophy of language.\n\nIn this vein, for example, he tried to lay new foundations for the\ntheory of value by going back to value-feelings (emotions) as its\npsychological basis. But although Meinong had constantly recognized\nthe fundamental role of psychology in philosophy, he became more and\nmore an opponent of psychologism. His switch to an objectivistic\naccount of a theory of value (1912) and his distinction between the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d (mental) content and the object of a\nmental act, introduced in 1899, became hallmarks of his\nanti-psychologism.\n\nMeinong found a sympathetic reader in Bertrand Russell. However,\nRussell later rejected both Meinong\u2019s object theory, with its\nconception of non-being, and his philosophical psychology, which\nconceives consciousness as a relation to objects via mental contents.\nRussell\u2019s criticism was mainly responsible for Meinong\u2019s\ninternational recognition. On the one hand, Russell made Meinong\nnotorious. On the other hand, the controversy with Russell also became\nan incentive for the development of Meinongian versions of logic and\nsemantics as a serious alternative to classical logic and semantics\n(especially neo-Meinongianism, a modern version of Meinongianism).\n",
