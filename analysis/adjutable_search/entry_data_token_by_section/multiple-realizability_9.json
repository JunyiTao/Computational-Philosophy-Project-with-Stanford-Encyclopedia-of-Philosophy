    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || Reduction and Identity Theory Reconceived\n2.5 Reduction and Identity Theory Reconceived\n\nThe more radical type of multiple realizability seems to force\nincreasingly narrower domains for reductions to be relativized; at the\nextreme, to individuals at times. This much \u201clocal\nreduction\u201d seems inconsistent with the assumed generality of\nscience. To avoid this problem, some philosophers of science have\nsuggested significant changes to the \u201cclassical\u201d\n(Nagelian) account of (intertheoretic) reduction to enable the account\nto handle multiple realizability of reduced kinds, a feature of a\nnumber of \u201ctextbook\u201d cases of scientific reductions.\n\nFollowing suggestions by Clifford Hooker (1981) and Berent En\u00e7\n(1983), John Bickle (1998: Chapter 4) argues that even the radical\ntype of multiple realizability (in the same token system over time\nsense) is a feature of some widely-accepted historical scientific\nreductions. For example, it occurs in the reduction of classical\nequilibrium thermodynamics to statistical mechanics and microphysics.\nFor any token aggregate of gas molecules, there is an indefinite\nnumber of realizations of a given temperature: a given mean\nmolecular kinetic energy. Microphysically, the most fine-grained\ntheoretical specification of a gas is its microcanonical ensemble, in\nwhich the momentum and location (and thus the kinetic energy) of each\nmolecule is specified. Indefinitely many distinct microcanonical\nensembles of a token volume of gas molecules can yield the same\nmean molecular kinetic energy. Thus at the lowest level of\nmicrophysical description, a given temperature is vastly multiply\nrealizable in the same token system over times. Nevertheless, the case\nof temperature is a textbook case of scientific reduction. So even\nthis radical type of token-token multiple realizability is no barrier\nin principle to reducibility. An actual case in science exemplifies\nit.\n\nTo accommodate multiple realizability, Hooker (1981: Part III)\nsupplements his general theory of reduction with an account of\n\u201ctoken-to-token\u201d reductions. He notes explicitly that this\nsupplement builds the possibility of handling multiple realizability\ndirectly into his revised definition of the reduction relation. Let\nS be the predicate, \u201csatisfies functional theory\nF\u201d, T be the class of systems to which the token\nsystem in question belongs, S\u2032 be an appropriate\npredicate in some lower level theory of T-system causal mechanisms,\nand T* be the class of systems to which S\u2032\napplies. Then, according to Hooker, \n\n\nsystems of type S of class T are contingently\ntoken/token identical with systems of type S\u2032 in class\nT* =df every instance (token) of a type\nS system externally classified as in class T is\ncontingently identical with some instance (token) of a type\nS\u2032 system externally classified as in class\nT*. (1981: 504) \n\n\nBy \u201cexternally classified\u201d, Hooker refers to the sort of\ncross-classification that holds across different\ndeterminable/determinate hierarchies. To address some self-assessed\nshortcomings of Hooker\u2019s own formulation of his general account\nof reduction, Bickle (1998) reformulates Hooker\u2019s insights,\nincluding his token-token reduction supplement, within a\nset-theoretically characterized \u201csemantic\u201d account of\ntheory structure and relations. Bickle\u2019s account draws directly\non formal work from \u201cstructuralist\u201d philosophy of science.\nMore recently Klein (2013) advocated for a semantic \u201csets of\nmodels\u201d account of theory structure as a strategy for\naccommodating multiple realized reduced kinds.\n\nOther reconceptions of both reduction and the mind-brain identity\ntheory have been proposed explicitly to handle multiple realizability.\nElliott Sober (1999) insists that a reductionist thesis actually\nfollows from the multiple realizability premise. He begins by\nattacking Putnam\u2019s (1967) \u201cobjective\u201d account of\nsuperior explanation, namely that one explanation is superior to\nanother if the former is more general. According to Putnam, superior\nexplanations \u201cbring out the relevant laws\u201d. But Sober\nreminds us that explanatory generalizations at lower levels bring out\nmore details. Science \u201caims for depth as well as breadth\u201d\nand there is no \u201cobjective rule\u201d concerning which endeavor\nis \u201cbetter\u201d (1999: 550). Both reductionists and\nanti-reductionists err in privileging one aim at the expense of the\nother. Sober then notes that multiple realizability\npresupposes some form of asymmetric determination: the lower level\nphysical properties that are present at a given time determine the\nhigher level properties that are present. But this assumption commits\nits proponents to the causal completeness of physics, the thesis that\nphysical effects have only physical causes (a doctrine that Sober\nsketches toward the end of his 1999). If one is also concerned with\ncausal explanation\u2014that is, if one holds that individual\noccurrences are explained by citing their causes\u2014then the causal\ncompleteness of physics in turn commits multiple realizability\nproponents to physics\u2019 possessing an important kind of\nexplanatory completeness that all other sciences lack. This is\n\u201creductionism of a sort\u201d (Sober 1999: 562).\n\nWilliam Bechtel and Robert McCauley (1999) develop a version of\n\u201cheuristic\u201d mind-brain identity theory (HIT) and defend it\nexplicitly against multiple realizability. HIT insists that identity\nclaims in science typically are hypotheses adopted in the course of\nempirical investigations, which serve to guide subsequent research.\nThey are not conclusions reached after empirical research has been\nconducted. Concerning the multiple realizability of psychological on\nbrain (physical) states, cognitive neuroscience\u2019s heuristic\nidentity claims assert type-commonalities in comparative studies\nacross species, not type-differences. Bechtel and McCauley illustrate\ntheir hypothesis with case studies: Brodmann\u2019s early twentieth\ncentury work mapping the brain into functionally relevant areas;\nFerrier\u2019s late-nineteenth century work employing electrical\nstimulation to cortex; and more recent detailed maps of visual\nprocessing regions in the primate brain. All of these landmark\nfunctional anatomical studies used multiple species. As Bechtel and\nMcCauley remind us,\n\n\nwhen they consider theories of mind-brain relations, philosophers seem\nto forget that the overwhelming majority of studies have been on\nnon-human brains. \u2026 Although the ultimate objective is to\nunderstand the structure and function of the human brain,\nneuroscientists depend upon indirect, comparative procedures to apply\nthe information from studies with non-human animals to the study of\nthe human brain. (1999: 70\u201371)\n\n\nHeuristic psychoneural type-identity claims across species are key\ncomponents of these standard neuroscientific procedures.\n\nWhen reduction or identity theory gets reconceived in ways built to\naccommodate multiple realizability, are reductionists/identity\ntheorists and proponents of multiple realizability then simply talking\npast one another? Perhaps not. It is worth reminding ourselves that\nmany nonreductive physicalists have employed multiple realizability to\nargue against all forms of psychophysical reductionism. If\nbetter general accounts of scientific reduction or identity theory\nmake room for multiple realizability, these demonstrations count\nagainst this broader challenge. And if \u201cnonreductive\u201d\nphysicalists were to reformulate their position to oppose only a\nspecific brand of psychophysical reductionism or identity theory, that\nwould weaken their position significantly, perhaps to the point of\nshowing that it targets a straw person, but also making it compatible\nwith forms of \u201creductive\u201d physicalism. In fact, this\nreconception move on the part of reductionists and identity theorists\ntraces back to Fodor\u2019s (1974) essay. While Fodor\u2019s\narguments there explicitly targeted a reductionism built on the\nclassical Nagelian account, he suggests in footnote 2 that \n\n\nwhat I shall be attacking is what many people have in mind when they\nrefer to the unity of science, and I suspect (though I shan\u2019t\ntry to prove it) that many of the liberalized versions of reductionism\nsuffer from the same basic defect as what I shall take to be the\nclassical form of the doctrine. \n\n\nThe problem was, even back then, new work on (intertheoretic)\nreduction in the philosophy of science was attempting explicitly to\nmake room for multiple realizability of reduced on reducing kinds.\nFodor\u2019s \u201cshan\u2019t trying to prove\u201d the\ngenerality of his attack against even the earliest of those\nreconceptions begged explicitly one of the questions they were\naddressing.\n",
