    "main_text": "Definitions\n4. Definitions\n\nIn the Metaphysics, Aristotle praises Archytas for having\noffered definitions which took account of both form and matter\n(1043a14\u201326 = A22). The examples given are\n\u201cwindlessness\u201d (n\u00eanemia), which is defined\nas \u201cstillness [the form] in a quantity of air [the\nmatter],\u201d and \u201ccalm-on-the-ocean\u201d\n(gal\u00ean\u00ea), which is defined as \u201clevelness\n[the form] of sea [the matter].\u201d The terms form and matter are\nAristotle\u2019s, and we cannot be sure how Archytas conceptualized\nthe two parts of his definitions. A plausible suggestion is that he\nfollowed his predecessor Philolaus in adopting limiters and unlimiteds\nas his basic metaphysical principles and that he saw his definitions\nas combinations of limiters, such as levelness and stillness, with\nunlimiteds, such as air and sea. The oddity of\n\u201cwindlessness\u201d and \u201ccalm-on-the-sea\u201d as\nexamples suggests that they were not the by-products of some other\nsort of investigation, e.g. cosmology, but were chosen precisely to\nillustrate principles of definition. Archytas may thus have devoted a\ntreatise to the topic. Aristotle elsewhere comments on the use of\nproportion in developing definitions and uses these same examples\n(Top. 108a7). The ability to recognize likeness in things of\ndifferent genera is said to be the key. \u201cWindlessness\u201d and\n\u201ccalm-on-the-ocean\u201d are recognized as alike, and this\nlikeness can be expressed in the following proportion: as\nn\u00eanemia is to the air so gal\u00ean\u00ea is\nto the sea. It is tempting to suppose that Archytas, who saw the world\nas explicable in terms of number and proportion, also saw proportion\nas the key in developing definitions. This would explain another\nreference to Archytas in Aristotle. At Rhetoric\n1412a9\u201317 (= A12) Aristotle praises Archytas precisely for his\nability to see similarity, even in things which differ greatly, and\ngives as an example Archytas\u2019 assertion that an arbitrator and\nan altar are the same. DK oddly include this text among the testimonia\nfor Archytas\u2019 life, but it clearly is part of Archytas\u2019\nwork on definition. The definitions of both an altar and an arbitrator\nwill appeal to their common functions as a refuge, while recognizing\nthe different context and way in which this function is carried out.\nFor doubts about this reconstruction of Archytas\u2019 theory of\ndefinition, see Barker 2006, 314\u2013318 and Schofield 2014, 80.\n",
