    "main_text": "Thoughts on progress, liberty and education || Feminism\n6. Conclusion\n\nCatharine Macaulay was a significant contributor to eighteenth century\ndebates over human rights and republican liberty, who was celebrated\nand influential during her lifetime, but her histories and political\nworks had fallen into obscurity by the first half of the twentieth\ncentury. Interest in her was stimulated by Lucy Donnelly\u2019s pioneering\narticle and research by Florence and William Boos, Christopher and\nBridget Hill, and Lynne Withey (Donnelly 1949; Boos 1976; Boos and\nBoos 1980; Hill and Hill 1967; Hill 1992; Withey 1976). Recognition of\nthe influence of her educational and political ideas has since grown\nconsiderably (Hay 1995; Waithe 1987\u201395, 3.217\u201322; Looser 2000, 2003;\nWiseman 2001; Schnorrenberg 1979, 1990; Hutton 2005, 2007, 2009;\nGunther-Canada 1998, 2003; Gardner 1998; Gardner 2000; Hicks 2002;\nTitone 2004; Hammersley 2010). Nevertheless, although beginning to be\nbetter known, she is usually only mentioned in passing in standard\naccounts of the development of democratic theory and feminism. Her\nmoralised understanding of the grounds of human rights and\njustification for democracy provide an important counter-balance to\nHobbesian versions of the social contract and deserve a far more\ncentral place in the history of liberal political theory than is\ncurrently the case (Green 2018; Green 2020).\n",
