    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention and Knowledge\n3.4 Attention and Knowledge\n\nThe apparent links between attention and demonstrative reference (see\nsection\n 3.2)\n and attention and knowledge of other minds (see section\n 3.3)\n might be special instances of a more general connection between\nattention and the making of epistemic moves. A general connection of\nthat sort may have been what Descartes had in mind when he suggested\nthat attention to clear and distinct ideas is a necessary condition\nfor those ideas to realize their special epistemic potential (see\nSection\n 1.1).\n It might also be what Stewart had in mind when he suggested that\n\u201cSome attention [is] necessary for any act of memory\nwhatever\u201d (see Section\n 1.4).\n Kant\u2019s anthropological writings also cast attention in a\ncrucial epistemic role, as explaining the control that one can exert\nover representations in thought and in imagination, where this perhaps\nincludes the kind of imagination that Kant takes to be involved in\nmaking one\u2019s experiences into experiences of an objective\nspatiotemporal world (Merritt & Valaris, 2017).\n\nAlthough each of these philosophers have tended to frame it in a way\nthat reflects their other theoretical commitments, some version of the\nidea that attention is always involved in the making of epistemic\nmoves can be made pre-theoretically plausible. The inattentional\nblindness experiments, in which participants are visually presented\nwith large changes while attending to something else, show that\ninattentive people can fail to notice all sorts of perceivable things\nthat attentive people would find obvious. Something exactly similar\nseems to be true in the case of a priori reasoning: just as no item is\nso large, so central, and so well-lit that no conscious and sighted\nobserver could miss it, so there is no step in reasoning that is so\nsimple, so compelling, and so obvious, that every thinker, whether\nattentive or inattentive, can be expected to recognise it. Just as the\ninattentional blindness effects might seem to show that there are\nattentional demands that a thinker has to meet before his perceptual\nencounter with things can provide him with knowledge of them, so it is\nplausible that there are similar attentional demands that have to be\nmet before the thinker\u2019s grasp of a thought gives her a\njustified belief in that thought\u2019s consequences. This\ninterpretation of the inattentional blindness effects is, however,\ncontroversial. Nicholas Silins and Susanna Siegel have suggested that\n\u2013 even if inattention does sometimes explain a perceiving\nperson\u2019s failure to form a belief about the things happening in\ntheir visual field \u2013 unattended aspects of experience are\nnonetheless capable of providing justification for such beliefs\n(Silins and Sigel, 2019). \u00c9mile Thalbard argues to the contrary\n(Thalabard, 2020).\n\nIn both the a priori case and the perceptual case, the acquisition of\nknowledge seems to require attention on at least some occasions, and\nin both of these cases that requirement seems to be a\npractical one. It may be that knowledge of some propositions\nis required if one\u2019s experience with a gorilla is to provide one\nwith knowledge of the gorilla\u2019s presence (with the propositions\nhere being of a sort that could serve as a major premise in an\ninference by which one\u2019s perceptual experience was interpreted),\nbut the requirement on gaining knowledge from experience cannot be\nthat one must be bearing such propositions in mind. The same is true\nin the a priori domain. What is required before an a priori\nentitlement can be recognized cannot be that one has to entertain some\nprior knowledge of a proposition from which that entitlement can be\ndeduced. To suppose that occurrent propositional knowledge is what is\nnecessary for such moves would be to embark on the regress set by\nLewis Carroll\u2019s tortoise to Achilles (Carroll, 1895). What\nepistemic move-making requires is not occurrent knowledge of a\nproposition. The thing that it requires is the right sort of active\nattention.\n\nThe attentional requirements that have to be met before one can\nacquire knowledge from experience or recognize an a priori entitlement\nare not requirements merely for alertness. They are not captured\nmerely by saying that, in order to gain knowledge, the thinker has to\npay some attention to the relevant ideas. A thinker may be attending\nto a syllogism, but, if he is attending to its rhythm, he may still be\nunable to see that the conclusion follows. A non-question begging\ncharacterisation of the attentional requirements of knowledge\nacquisition in general would be an important contribution to\nepistemology. Current work on attention, focussing as it does on\nattention as a perceptual phenomenon, may give us only part of the\ngeneral theory that we need. Work on the purely intellectual forms of\nattention continues to be scarce. This shortcoming has been emphasized\nby Mark Fortney, who argues that the neglect of intellectual attention\nhas led philosophers to misinterpret some of the claims made in the\nempirical literature on attention and consciousness (Fortney, 2019).\nFortney also claims that considerations pertaining to intellectual\nattention should have a central role in debates about the transparency\nof phenomenology, and about the consequences of this transparency for\nthe epistemology of self-attributed thoughts (debates that are\nexemplified, in Fortney\u2019s discussion, by Byrne, 2018). Fortney\nsuggests that, when attention is given this role, certain results from\ncognitive psychology cast light on these debates. He thinks, when seen\nin this light, some of the claims that have been made about the\ntransparency of occurrent thought start to seem dubious (Fortney,\n2020).\n",
