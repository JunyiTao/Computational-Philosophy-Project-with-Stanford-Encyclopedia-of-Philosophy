    "main_text": "Philosophical Fragments on History and Psychology || Psychology of Life\n3.2 History of Life\n\nAccording to Yorck, the characteristics of human psychology and the\neconomy of primary life delimit the course of history, since\nhistorical life merely repeats or amplifies the primary stances of\nconsciousness. Although there is thus a natural ground for history,\nYorck is at pains to emphasize that the three psychological functions\noutline \u201cpossibilities\u201d only, without any inbuilt\nteleology or fixed equilibrium, or a relation to \u201can unchanging\nordo\u201d as a permanent backdrop for history (ST, p. 4).\nAgainst such approximations of history to nature, Yorck argues for a\nthoroughly historical conception of the historical: \u201cHistory has\nnothing of the isolation [Selbst\u00e4ndigkeit] of the\nnatural [order]\u201d (ST, p. 6), but rather, in each of its phases,\nhistory is self-reflexively involved in its own\nhistoricity\u2014\u201cas the ferment of its\naliveness\u201d\u2014and thus opens itself to the ever new\n\u201chistorical contrapposto\u201d (ST, p. 6). Nothing is\nexempt from historical change. Philosophical categories through which\nthe world is understood are historical products of life and hence\ninextricably bound up with the historicity of humankind. For instance,\nYorck explicitly claims that the category of \u201cbeing\u201d is\nitself \u201ca result of life\u201d (ST, p. 8). This liberates\nhistory from all relation to an unchanging, fixed point of reference\noutside historical\n life.[16]\n\nAlthough Yorck provides only an unfinished sketch of the empirical\ncourse of the history of life, he marks three decisive turning-points:\n(1) The breakthrough to philosophy and science on the basis of the\ndominant stance of the psychological function of representation or\ncognition, primarily in ancient Greece and India; (2) the predominance\nof willing in the Roman and Jewish stance towards the world; and (3)\nthe focal centrality of feeling and interiority in Christianity,\nparticular in the Reformation, i.e., Luther. Somewhat like Hegel,\nYorck holds that history unfolds through particular primary stances\ntowards life which then become dominant in particular historical\n peoples.[17]\n3.2.1 The Greek World\n\nAccording to Yorck, in Ancient Greece consciousness displayed a\nparticular configuration of the primacy of cognition. For the Greeks,\nthe stance of consciousness towards the world is pure looking. It is\nthrough looking that reality is understood. Affectivity (feeling) and\nvolition are not countenanced as functions that disclose the world as\n such.[18]\n Truth lies in the beholding eye alone; contemplation,\ntheoria, and intuition take centre stage.\n\n\nIt is as if the clear-sighted eye is expressed in words. On the basis\nof this condition of consciousness, the function of looking\n[Anschauung], ocularity [Okularit\u00e4t], becomes\nthe organ of all free work of the mind, particularly of philosophy.\n(ST, p. 30)\n\n\nYorck finds evidence for the prevalence of ocularity or the aesthetic\nattitude, which is centred on plasticity [Gestaltlichkeit],\nin Homer, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, among others.\n\n\nForm and content constitute the aesthetic dichotomy which governs\nGreek thought in its entirety, the result of the liberation of\nocularity from all other sensuality, the aesthetic liberation, which\nstrikes a chord in everyone who has entered the threshold of Greek\nlife. Looking is the essential comportment; hence, Gestalt or Form\n[qualifies as] ousia or\n substance.[19]\n (ST, p. 31)\n\n\nThat Greek metaphysics seeks the unchangeable and impassable is the\nresult of the relative suppression of feeling and willing latent in\nall cognition, which abstracts from desires, feelings, and temporality\n(ST, p. 42). Put differently, the structural timelessness of thought\nas such is intensified in metaphysical thought where it becomes\n\u201cabsolute\u201d (ST, p. 42). Yorck emphasizes that\n\u201cnegation of temporality\u201d marks \u201cthe decisive\nmetaphysical step\u201d (ST, p. 66). Metaphysics constitutes the\ncounter-move against the feeling of temporality (that everything\npasses away), as well as the liberation from the dependence on objects\ndesired by the will. According to Yorck, the escape from temporality\nand attachment determines the entire metaphysical tradition up to and\nincluding Hegel (because even Hegel \u201contologizes\u201d life and\nrenders it ontic) (ST, p. 83).\n3.2.2 The Roman & Jewish World\n\nThe breakthrough to a form of life predominantly lived through\nstriving and volition is, according to Yorck, characteristic of the\nJewish and Roman world. Concerning the former, Yorck writes:\n\n\nWhereas the Greek, metaphysical cast of mind abstracts from\ntemporality, temporality is the determining element [in the Hebrew\nworld], as the non-aesthetic character of the Jewish way of thought is\nalready expressed in Genesis where time takes precedence over\nspace. Yet the moment of time is here placed in some metaphysical\ndistance, is, as it were, projected into the future, the realization\nof which is the prerogative of God. Thus, the stance of consciousness\nis one of hope. The messiah, who does not fulfil the law, but, rather,\ndelivers on the promise, is hoped for. (ST, p. 20)\n\n\nThus, the feeling of time is here aligned with volition and its\nprojective exteriorization. Relative to the Greek contemplation of the\neverlasting presence of the cosmos, the intensive expectation of the\nfuture reality in the Jewish world is \u201ca-cosmic.\u201d\nComparing the Greek to the Jewish world, Yorck writes:\n\n\nHere, contemplative, eternal presence; there, intense hope for an\ninvisible futurity. Here, knowledge and science; there, coupled with a\nradical devaluation of the object of knowledge, faith as personally\ngrown postulate. Here, pleasant expansion and the fullness of existing\nobjectivity; there, formless energy directed at the reality\nanticipated. (ST, p. 22)\n\n\nThe unfinished character of Yorck\u2019s manuscript is apparent\nespecially in these passages, for there is no further exploration or\nexposition of the Jewish world (let alone anything like a\njustification for the juxtaposition of the Jewish world with the Roman\nperiod). Yorck\u2019s comments concerning the Roman world are\nlikewise very sketchy at best. Although Yorck positions the Romans as\na world-historical people of the will, he does not do much more than\nto refer to the popular notion of the \u201cimperialist drive of the\nRomans\u201d (ST, p. 30). Once, in a letter to Dilthey, Yorck\nemphasizes that the Roman pursuit of power locks life into pure\nimmanence, without temporality and transcendence: \u201cMight is\neverything,\u201d he writes (CR, p. 120). Yorck continues by\ncontending that the proverbial epithet of Rome as the \u201cEternal\nCity\u201d is by no means a mere saying. Rather, for Yorck, it\ncaptures something of the ostentatious display of Rome\u2019s\nimperial power\u2014its splendid oblivion of time. Yorck writes:\n\u201cRome does not, just as no Roman ever does,\ncomprehend\u2014death\u201d (CR, p. 120). By way of historical\ncontraposition, Yorck then describes, in the same letter, the\n\u201cmute, simple crosses\u201d scratched into the walls of the\nunderground Carcere Mamertino by imprisoned early Christians.\nYorck characterizes these crosses as \u201clight-points on the\nunderground sky [of the prison], signs of the transcendence of\nconsciousness\u201d (CR, p. 120). The immanence of a life lived for\npower and might is contrasted with the interiority of a conscious\nfeeling of transcendence.\n3.2.3 Christianity\n\nFor Yorck, the Christian life is the breakthrough to a fully\nhistorical life. Unencumbered by the projection of objective knowledge\n(Greek metaphysics and ocularity) and freed from the expectation of a\nmessiah (hope for the promised future), the Christian lives the\ntemporality of \u201cabsolute aliveness\u201d [absolute\nLebendigkeit] in the depths of inwardness or\n interiority[20]\n (ST, p. 4). Since Christian consciousness has its dominant focus in\ninteriority and feeling, it is free from the cognitive and volitional\nbonds to any objectivity, but free for the rhythm of temporality and\nhistory. The Christian \u201cfreedom from the world\u201d\n[Weltfreiheit] (ST, p. 81) is at the same time freedom\nfor history and transcendence, i.e., the world-transcendent\nGod, and the personal, felt relationship to him, which is based on the\npersonal responsibility for one\u2019s historical life before God.\nYorck writes:\n\n\nThrough Christianity an essentially transcendent stance of\nconsciousness is achieved, namely by way of the basic factor of\nfeeling. This is a transcendent stance, in contradistinction to a\nmetaphysical\n one,[21]\n because feeling [Gef\u00fchl]\u2014the focal point of\naliveness [Lebendigkeit]\u2014is here turned inwards, even\nturned against itself and hence free of all givenness\n[Gegebenheit]. (ST, pp. 13/14)\n\n\nThe release from cognitive and volitional projection facilitates an\ninversion of life\u2019s tendency; it leaves behind the goals of\n\u201ccertainty and security\u201d (CR, p. 143) and grounds life in\nthe personal and intrinsically historical relationship to God.\n\nOn the one hand, Yorck emphasizes the absolute focus on inner life and\nindividual conscience, and the entirely unpredictable and historical\nrelationship to God, this side of all objective worldly realities and\npublic\n opinion.[22]\n The individual person is singled out in his relationship to God. On\nthe other hand, Yorck also holds that the Christian inversion of the\nprojective tendency of life ultimately results in\n\u201cself-renunciation\u201d [Selbstaufgabe], which\nexpresses the religious pole, opposite to ethical self-affirmation\nthrough philosophy and science. But precisely through this\nself-renunciation, life is lived as life, instead of being\nlost in the preoccupation with that which is merely intended through\nlife\u2014the objectively known and desired world. With reference to\nMatthew (10:39), Yorck writes:\n\n\nHe who finds his life, will lose it, he who loses it, will find it.\nThis word of the Lord describes the law of life itself, the basic\ncondition of all life. Death is a mark of life and the radical\ntranscendence of the deepest, the Christian standpoint postulates life\nas a mark of death. (ST, p. 58)\n\n\nYorck\u2019s well-known love for paradox has its definitive origin\n here.[23]\n\nFreed from the bonds to objective representation and the objective\nworld, Christian religion realizes the most concentrated or enhanced\nform of living life as life; it is \u201csupreme\naliveness\u201d [h\u00f6chste Lebendigkeit] and thus supreme\nhistoricity (ST, p. 104; CR, p. 154). The Christian life is not\ndistracted by the aims of cognition (objectivity) or the ties to\nobjects of desire within the world (in the past, present, or future).\nAccordingly, Yorck holds that the historical \u201corigin\u201d and\n\u201csupreme\u201d manifestation of life\u2014fully lived as\nhistorical life\u2014lies in Christianity.\n\nIn his Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften (1883),\nDilthey had made a similar, but by no means identical, point, arguing\nthat \u201chistorical consciousness\u201d first came into existence\nthrough the Christian freedom from the outer world (the cosmos) and\nthe newfound centre of life in inwardness (Dilthey 1959, p. 254).\nDilthey writes:\n\n\nFor the Greek mind, knowledge was the depiction [Abbilden] of\nsomething objective, [given] to intelligence. Now [after the emergence\nof Christianity], lived experience [Erlebnis] becomes the\ncentre point of all interests for the new communities; but this is\nnothing other than the simple, inner awareness [Innewerden]\nof what is given to the person in self-consciousness. (Dilthey 1959,\np. 251)\n\n\nYet Dilthey sees this as the first potential breakthrough to a new\nscience, the science of inner experience and the historical\ndisciplines, the Humanities or Geisteswissenschaften.\nAccording to Dilthey, Augustine\u2019s fateful dependence on Greek\nconceptuality made it impossible to fully articulate the new Christian\nsense of inwardness and history (Dilthey 1959, p. 264). Only through\nthe work of Schleiermacher and Kant has there been progress in\narticulating the original Christian insight into inwardness and\nhistoricity of life (Dilthey 1959, p. 267). Not only does Dilthey\nfully accept that the meaning of the original Christian experience is\nthus adequately comprehended and harnessed for the understanding, but\nhe also sees his own work on the logic of the historical sciences as a\ncontinuation and fulfilment of this same project.\n\nBy contrast, Yorck eschews all cooptation of the Christian\nbreakthrough to supreme historical aliveness and historicity for the\nestablishment of a science, fearing that this would not only\nconceptualize life as something \u201contic,\u201d always present\nand available for the understanding, but also ignore the vital\nconsciousness of transcendence, or bury it in a new\n scholasticism.[24]\n Yorck, who always regarded Luther\u2019s work as the vital\nre-affirmation of the early Christian historical life, suggests,\ntherefore, that instead of Kant and Schleiermacher, a return to\nLuther\u2019s conception of life is the more fruitful way of\nsafeguarding and cultivating the breakthrough to historical life.\nAcknowledging this difference, Yorck writes to Dilthey:\n\n\nYou will not agree when I say that Luther should and must be more\ntopical to the present time than Kant, if this present time is to have\na historical future [historische Zukunft].
