    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Divine simplicity\n3.1 Divine simplicity\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s most significant work, On First Philosophy\n(for which see Abu Rida 1950, 97\u2013162, Ivry 1974, Rashed and Jolivet\n1998, 9\u201399), is devoted to \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d or\nmetaphysics, a science al-Kindi immediately identifies with the study\nof God. Since all philosophy is an inquiry into truth, first philosophy\nis the knowledge of God, who is \u201cthe first truth and the cause of\nall truth.\u201d While this may not sound like it has much to do with\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of first philosophy as the science of\nbeing, al-Kindi closely associates being with truth (\u201ceverything\nthat has being has truth\u201d). For him, to say that God is the cause\nof all truth is tantamount to saying that God is the cause of all\nbeing, a point made more explicit at the end of what remains to us of\nOn First Philosophy (see further below, 3.2).\n\n\nThe central concept in the theology of On First Philosophy,\nhowever, is neither truth nor being, but oneness. Indeed al-Kindi\nargues for a first cause of being precisely by arguing for a first\ncause of oneness, and asserting that \u201cbringing something to\nbe\u201d means imposing unity of a certain kind. Al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical theology thus has two main aspects: a proof that there\nmust be some \u201ctrue One\u201d that is the cause of the unity in\nall things, and a discussion of the nature of this true One. These\naspects are treated, respectively, in the third and fourth sections\nof On First Philosophy.\n\n\nIn the third section, al-Kindi first proves that nothing can be its\nown cause, a point that is not used explicitly in what follows, but\nmay be intended to show that nothing can be the cause of its own\nunity. He then undertakes an exhaustive survey of the various types of\n\u201cutterance (lafz).\u201d Following Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge, he classifies all predicates or terms\n(maqulat) into genus, species, difference, individual, proper\naccident, and common accident. Taking them in turn, al-Kindi argues\nthat each type of predicate implies both unity and multiplicity. For\nexample, animal is one genus, but it is made up of a\nmultiplicity of species; human is one species but is made up\nof many individuals; and a single human is one individual but made up\nof many bodily parts. Finally, al-Kindi seeks an explanation for the\nassociation of unity and multiplicity in all these things. He argues\nthat the association cannot be merely the product of chance; nor can\nit be caused by any part of the set of things that are both one and\nmany.  So there must be some external cause for the association of\nunity and multiplicity. This cause will be exclusively one, entirely\nfree of multiplicity: al-Kindi expresses this by saying that it is\n\u201cessentially\u201d one, whereas the other things are\n\u201caccidentally\u201d one. He also speaks of it as \u201cone in\ntruth,\u201d whereas other things are one\n\u201cmetaphorically.\u201d In short, the cause in question is the\n\u201ctrue One,\u201d or God.\n\n\nNow, since we have already seen that every sort of term or\nexpression implies multiplicity as well as unity, it is no surprise\nthat in section four of One First Philosophy al-Kindi goes on\nto argue that the various sorts of predicate are inapplicable to the\ntrue One. He sums up his conclusion as follows (Rashed and Jolivet\n1998, 95):\n\n\nThus the true One possesses no matter, form, quantity, quality, or\nrelation. And is not described by any of the other terms: it has no\ngenus, no specific difference, no individual, no proper accident, and\nno common accident. It does not move, and is not described through\nanything that is denied to be one in truth. It is therefore only pure\nunity, I mean nothing other than unity. And every unity other than it\nis multiple.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, this conclusion has been compared to the view of\nthose contemporary theologians referred to as Mu\u2018tazilites. They\nsimilarly took a strict view on the question of divine attributes,\narguing that God\u2019s simplicity ruled out the acceptance of any\nattributes distinct from God\u2019s essence. However it is Greek\nantecedents that are clearly the main influence on al-Kindi here. His\n\u201ctrue One\u201d bears a strong resemblance to the first\nprinciple of the Neoplatonists. Indeed we might be reminded of Plato\nhimself, insofar as al-Kindi\u2019s God seems to function like a\nPlatonic Form. Just as the Form of Equal is entirely equal and not at\nall unequal, and serves to explain equality in other things, so God is\nentirely one, not at all multiple, and explains the unity in other\nthings.\n",
