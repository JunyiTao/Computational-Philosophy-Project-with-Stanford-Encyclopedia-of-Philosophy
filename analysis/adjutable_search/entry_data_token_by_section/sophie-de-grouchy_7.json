    "main_text": "Works || Political Journalism and Translations\n3.2 Political Journalism and Translations\n\nLe R\u00e9publicain, edited by the founding members of the\nSociety of the same name (Condorcet, Brissot, Paine, Duchatelet,\nDumont, and Sophie de Grouchy) lasted for four issues in the\nspring/summer 1791. Grouchy seems to have been quite involved in the\nproduction of the journal. In the first issue, she translated two\npieces by Thomas Paine (one of which is signed Duchastellet, despite\nhaving been written by Paine). The third piece in that first issue is\nsigned \u201cLa V\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d (Truth) which featured as\na signature on Grouchy\u2019s stationary. Stylistically, it appears\nto have been a collaboration between Grouchy and Condorcet. Its\nargument is a justification of the revolution to foreigners, an\nexplanation of how the republican principles it embodied contribute to\nfreeing the people of France and how they will, at the right time, do\nthe same for other countries. The main piece of the second issue is\nthe first half of a long paper discussing a letter written by Louis\nXVI to the people of France before his attempted escape. It offers a\nrepublican analysis of the pitfalls of monarchy, even when the monarch\nin question is not a tyrant. The article was first drafted by Dumont,\nbut he later withdrew it and it was significantly rewritten using\narguments, phrases and style that can be found in the Letters on\nSympathy. The third issue contains the end of that article,\nanother letter by Paine, translated by Grouchy, and a short piece\nentitled \u201cLetter from a Young Mechanic\u201d which is unsigned\nbut attributed to Grouchy in which the fictional mechanical inventor\nwho is a student of Vaucanson proposes that the royal family be\nreplaced by a set of automata. Even though such machines are\nexpensive, it says, they will cost a fraction of what the French\npeople are spending on their actual king. And what\u2019s more, the\nmechanical king, far from being a tyrant, will raise its pen and sign\neverything its government wants it to! Jacques Vaucanson, the putative\nteacher of the fictional author was a famous inventor, and one whose\ninventions Condorcet had praised in his works as an example of the\nsort of technical activity that could be just as inspirational as\ntheories (Condorcet, Oeuvres, 413\u2013437, and Belhoste\n1994: 127).\n\nA recurrent theme both in the \u201cLetter from a Young\nMechanic\u201d and \u201cObservations on the King\u2019s\nLetter\u201d is the financial cost of maintaining a royal family.\nGrouchy, who had lived for some years in the Hotel de Monnaies while\nCondorcet was the inspector general of the Monnaie de Paris under\nNecker, had some knowledge of economics. Condorcet himself advocated a\nliberal economy, much closer to his previous superior, Turgot, a\nPhysiocrat who believed in a laisser-faire economy. Together Turgot\nand Condorcet had attempted in 1774 to solve the problem of the\ngrowing price of bread by letting the farmers decide how they sold\ntheir flour, instead of controlling the market. Unfortunately their\nreform was followed by a drought and later severe hail storms so that\nwhatever grain had managed to push through the dry soil was destroyed\nbecause it could not be harvested. The king, rather than following\nNecker\u2019s advice and waiting for his reforms to have their\neffect\u2014after all no amount of reform could change the\nweather\u2014sacked Turgot and gave his job to Necker. This did\nnothing to prevent the people from starving and France found itself in\nthe midst of the \u201cflour wars\u201d with riots in Paris and\npillages in the countryside by people who could no longer afford to\nbuy bread, or who spent their entire income on it, leaving nothing for\nclothes or housing. The final issue of the journal contains a long\nessay on the creation of an electoral council, a piece later reprinted\nas part of Condorcet\u2019s works.\n\nIn 1798, Grouchy published a two volume translation of Adam\nSmith\u2019s The Theory of Moral Sentiments and A\nDissertation on the Origins of Languages. Her translation was\nnotable in that it was based on the seventh (1792) and most\nauthoritative edition of Smiths\u2019s work. Also, unlike previous\ntranslators of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Grouchy\nfollowed the text closely, without summarizing, interpreting, adding,\nor deleting parts. Her translation remained in print until the late\ntwentieth century.\n",
