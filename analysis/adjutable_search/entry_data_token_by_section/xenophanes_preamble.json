    "main_text": "\n\nXenophanes of Colophon was a philosophically-minded poet who lived in\nvarious parts of the ancient Greek world during the late\n6th and early 5th centuries BCE. He is best\nremembered for a novel critique of anthropomorphism in religion, a\npartial advance toward monotheism, and some pioneering reflections on\nthe conditions of knowledge. Many later writers, perhaps influenced by\ntwo brief characterizations of Xenophanes by Plato (Sophist\n242c\u2013d) and Aristotle (Metaphysics 986b18\u201327),\nidentified him as the founder of Eleatic philosophy (the view that,\ndespite appearances, what there is is a changeless, motionless, and\neternal \u2018One\u2019). In fact, the Xenophanes who emerges from\nthe surviving fragments defies simple classification. He was a\ntravelling rhapsode who criticised the stories about the gods told by\nthe poets, and he defended a novel conception of the divine nature.\nBut he was also a reflective observer of the human condition, a\npractitioner of the special form of \u2018inquiry\u2019\n(histori\u00ea) introduced by the Milesian\nphilosopher-scientists, and a civic counselor who encouraged his\nfellow citizens to respect the gods and work to safeguard the\nwell-being of their city.\n",
