    "main_text": "Contemporary Definitions\n4. Contemporary Definitions\n Definitions of art attempt to make sense of two different sorts of\nfacts: art has important historically contingent cultural features, as\nwell as trans-historical, pan-cultural characteristics that point in\nthe direction of a relatively stable aesthetic core.  (Theorists who\nregard art as an invention of eighteenth-century Europe will, of\ncourse, regard this way of putting the matter as tendentious, on the\ngrounds that entities produced outside that culturally distinctive\ninstitution do not fall under the extension of \u201cart\u201d and\nhence are irrelevant to the art-defining project (Shiner\n2001). Whether the concept of art is precise enough to justify this\nmuch confidence about what falls under its extension claim is\nunclear.) Conventionalist definitions take art\u2019s contingent\ncultural features to be explanatorily fundamental, and aim to capture\nthe phenomena \u2013 revolutionary modern art, the traditional close\nconnection of art with the aesthetic, the possibility of autonomous\nart traditions, etc. \u2013 in social/historical\nterms. Classically-flavored or traditional definitions (also sometimes\ncalled \u201cfunctionalist\u201d) definitions reverse this\nexplanatory order.  Such classically-flavored definitions take\ntraditional concepts like the aesthetic (or allied concepts like the\nformal, or the expressive) as basic, and aim to account for the\nphenomena by making those concepts harder \u2013 for example, by\nendorsing a concept of the aesthetic rich enough to include\nnon-perceptual properties, or by attempting an integration of those\nconcepts (e.g., Eldridge, section 4.4 below) .\n",
