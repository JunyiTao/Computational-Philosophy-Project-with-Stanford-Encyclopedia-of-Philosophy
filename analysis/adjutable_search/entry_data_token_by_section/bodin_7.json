    "main_text": "Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions || Particular Questions\n6.1 Particular Questions \n(1) A Judaising Catholic. Did Bodin\u2019s passion for studying Judaic\ntexts arise principally from the influence of his Jewish mother? The\ntrail is a false one since his mother was not Jewish.  (2) Another\nfalse trail concerns how he had miraculously escaped the\nSt. Bartholomew massacre in Paris by seeking refuge with Christophle\nde Thou, the president of the Parlement of Paris \u2014 the story being\n\u201clate and unverifiable\u201daccording to Jacquelin Boucher\n(1983). Paul Collinet, who maintained initially that Bodin was not in\nParis but in the county of Rethelois at the time (Collinet 1908,\n752), later revised his ideas: he had confused J. Bodin de Saint-Amand\n(our J. Bodin) with another, J. B. de Montguichet (Collinet\n1910). This was in accordance with the study of Paul Cornu (Cornu\n1907) about \u201ctwo J. Bodins\u201d.  Nevertheless, Cornu himself\ncannot say where our Bodin was at that\n time.[15]\n In fact, we know nothing for certain about Bodin on the famous night\nof August 24, 1572, nor is it not a matter of central historical\nimportance.  (3) Belief in Witchcraft. Bodin, like the majority of\npeople in the sixteenth century, believed in the devil and the power\nof Satan. These beliefs made his biographers, especially those of the\nnineteenth century, uneasy. They felt that such\nsuperstitions tarnished Bodin\u2019s image.  Baudrillart criticized Bodin\u2019s\nwork Demonomanie and wrote that \u201cAbsurd fanaticism,\nridiculous and obnoxious should be written in the margins of each page\nof this unfortunate book\u201d (Baudrillart 1853, 184, 188\u2013189).\nSuch vain preoccupations and a lack historical sense are two faults,\namong others, that distort the historical analysis of Bodin by those\nwho wish to make him a man of their time rather than allowing\nhim to be a man of his day.\n",
