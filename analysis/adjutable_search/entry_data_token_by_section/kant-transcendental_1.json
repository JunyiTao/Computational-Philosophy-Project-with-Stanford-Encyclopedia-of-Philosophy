    "main_text": "The Transcendental Deduction || Apperception and its Unity\n1.1 Apperception and its Unity\n\nThe argument from above in \u00a716 can be divided into two stages.\nThe goal of the first is to establish the various components of\nthe principle of the necessary unity of apperception. The\nsecond stage aims to show that synthesis is a necessary condition for\nthe aforementioned aspect of self-consciousness, which this principle\nhighlights. Apperception is the apprehension of a mental\nstate \u2013 a representation, in Kant\u2019s terminology \u2013 as\none\u2019s own; one might characterize it as the self-ascription or\nself-attribution of a mental state (Strawson 1966: 93\u20134). In\nKant\u2019s conception, my apperception has necessary unity\nsince all of my representations must be grounded \u201cin\npure apperception, that is, in the thoroughgoing identity of\nthe self in all possible representations\u201d (B131\u20132,\nemphasis mine). By this he means that:\n\n(The principle of the necessary unity of apperception) It\nmust be the case that each of my representations is such that I can\nattribute it to my self, a subject which is the same for all of my\nself-attributions, which is distinct from its representations, and\nwhich can be conscious of its representations (A116, B131\u20132,\nB134\u20135).\n\n\nOne might note three aspects of the meaning of this principle. First,\nas pointed out earlier, Kant maintains that the apperceiving subject\nis not itself a collection of representations. Kant affirms that I\nhave no inner intuition of the subject (e.g. B157), and this claim\nwould conflict with the subject\u2019s being a collection of\nrepresentations, since he holds that I can intuit my representations\nby inner sense (e.g. A33/B49). Also, in \u00a716 Kant remarks:\n\u201cthrough the \u2018I\u2019, as simple representation, nothing\nmanifold is given; only in intuition, which is distinct from the\n\u2018I\u2019, can a manifold be given\u201d (B135). If he believed\nthe apperceiving subject to be a collection of representations, it\nwould be surprising for him to deny that anything manifold is given\nthrough my representation of it. Second, my ability to attribute\nrepresentations to myself as subject of them is pure, as\nopposed to empirical apperception. This means that I have\nthis ability not in virtue of Humean inner perception, or Kantian\ninner intuition, but rather independently of any such empirical\nfaculties. However, Kant repeatedly affirms that the purity of this\napperception does not imply that the subject to which one\u2019s\nrepresentations can be attributed is intuited \u2013 represented as\nan object \u2013 in a purely rational or a priori way (e.g.,\nB406\u20139). Third, Kant states that pure apperception is\noriginal, and the explication he provides is that \u201cit\nis that self-consciousness which, while generating the representation\n\u2018I think\u2019 \u2026 cannot itself be accompanied by any\nfurther representation\u201d (B132). I cannot have an intuition or\nany other type of representation of myself as apperceiving subject\nother than by way of \u2018I think\u2026\u2019-type thoughts, and\nhence these thoughts are the original representations of this subject\n(e.g., A350). At the same time, by virtue of my capacity for\napperception, I can have a kind of propositional grasp of the\napperceiving subject; Kant affirms that in apperception, I am\nconscious that I exist as subject (B157). (For recent\nextensive discussions of Kant on self-knowledge, see Rosefeldt 2000,\nKitcher 2011, and Longuenesse 2017; cf. Howell 2001.)\n\nKant initiates the first stage of the argument in \u00a716 by\nclaiming:\n\nIt must be possible for the \u2018I think\u2019 to accompany all my\nrepresentations; for otherwise something would be represented in me\nwhich could not be thought at all, and that is equivalent to saying\nthat the representation would be impossible, or at least would be\nnothing to me. (B131\u201332)\n\n\nOn one interpretation, the sense in which a representation would be\nimpossible or nothing to me if it could not accompanied with the\n\u2018I think\u2019 is simply that I could not then become conscious\nof it (Guyer 1987: 139\u201344). It is credible that for any\nrepresentation of which I am conscious, I can attribute it to myself\nas subject, assuming my mental faculties are in working order, and if\nno controversial account of the nature of the subject is presupposed.\nHowever, the claim that I can become conscious of each of my\nrepresentations, and that it is therefore possible for me attribute\neach of them to myself as their subject, is likely false. Plausibly,\nsome of my representations are so thoroughly subconscious that I\ncannot attribute them to myself, while they are nevertheless mine due\nto the causal relations they bear to other representations and to\nactions that are paradigmatically mine. Fortunately, however, the\npremise that each of my representations is such that I can attribute\nit to myself is not crucial for the argument from above. Rather, the\npremise Kant ultimately singles out is less committed, and focuses\nmore specifically on the identity or sameness of the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions, and my being conscious of this\nidentity.\n\nA number of interpreters, including Robert Howell (1992) and James van\nCleve (1999), maintain that the argument of \u00a716 requires a\npremise affirming the possibility of my being simultaneously\nconscious of the multiple elements of my representations, and that the\nimplausibility of this premise jeopardizes the soundness of the\nargument. Howell\u2019s specific objection is that Kant does not\nestablish the following crucial premise:\n\n(S) All of the elements of the manifold of i (where\ni is some arbitrary intuition) are such that H is or can\nbecome conscious, in thought, that all of those elements, taken\ntogether, are accompanied by the I think.\n\n\n(S) asserts that all of the individual elements of the selected\nintuition are such that the subject is or can become conscious of them\nsimultaneously. In Howell\u2019s interpretation, only if the elements\nof an intuition together and at the same time are accompanied by the\nsame I think will it be plausible that the subject must\nsynthesize these elements (Howell 1992: 162). On van Cleve\u2019s\nreading, it is required that for any intuition that I have, I actually\nbecome simultaneously conscious of its elements. If this\nco-consciousness were just merely possible, Kant could only conclude\nis that the resulting representation is only possibly subject to the\ncategories (van Cleve 1999: 84). On an interpretation of this type,\nthe mechanism of the argument of \u00a716 is to adduce a kind of unity\nor combination that my representations actually exhibit, and then to\nargue that this unity requires synthesis by means of the categories as\na condition or for its explanation. Kant is thus read as contending\nthat actual co-consciousness is a type of unity that demands synthesis\nby means of the categories, and that any variety of unity short of\nco-consciousness will be inadequate to establishing this objective of\nthe Deduction.\n\nHowell points out that (S) contrasts with a weaker claim:\n\n(W) Each element of the manifold of i is such that H is or\ncan become conscious, in thought, that the I think\naccompanies that element. (Howell 1992: 161)\n\n\nwhich allows that the individual elements of the intuition are such\nthat the subject can only become conscious of each separately, perhaps\nin turn. He contends, however, that the unity expressed by (W) is\ninsufficient to generate this need for synthesis. If I am merely\n(possibly or actually) serially conscious of the elements of an\nintuition, it won\u2019t be required that I synthesize them into a\nunified intuition. Howell goes on to argue that while (W) is credible,\nKant cannot in fact establish (S); it is implausible that such\nco-consciousness for any arbitrary intuition is actual or even\ngenuinely possible for us. Consequently, the soundness of this\nargument, and the overall argument of the B-Deduction is\nimperiled.\n\nHowever, it may be that only the weaker premise (W) is required for\nthe success of the argument of \u00a716. First, although the\nco-consciousness premise (S) might be suggested in \u00a716\nby the following text:\n\nThat relation comes about, not simply through my accompanying each\nrepresentation with consciousness, but only in so far as I conjoin one\nrepresentation with another, and am conscious of the synthesis of\nthem. (B133)\n\n\nthat claim is not uncontroversially made here. For by the assertion\nthat I \u201cam conscious of the synthesis of them,\u201d i.e., of\nthese representations, Kant may mean only that I am conscious that\nthey stand in a certain intimate relation to one another, for\ninstance, that that they are integrated with each other in a way\ndistinct from how mine are integrated with yours, which does not\nrequire co-consciousness (Pereboom 1995).\n\nMoreover, it might well be that the argument of \u00a716 features a\nsubtlety that obviates the need for actual co-consciousness. The text\nindicates that the argument crucially turns on the claim that only\na priori synthesis \u2013 that is, synthesis by a\npriori concepts \u2013 can explain how I might represent the\nidentity of my apperceptive consciousness (B133) or how I\nmight represent the identity of the apperceiving subject (B135)\nfor different elements of the manifold of intuition to which I can\nattach the I think. The inadequacy Kant claims for\n\u201cempirical consciousness,\u201d that is, for consciousness\naccording to Humean psychological theory, is that \u201cit is in\nitself dispersed (an sich zerstreut) and without relation to\nthe identity of the subject (und ohne Beziehung auf die\nIdentit\u00e4t des Subjects)\u201d (B133). One implication of\nthis passage is that Hume\u2019s theory does not have the resources\nneeded to explain how I can self-attribute various of my\nrepresentations or their elements to a subject that is both conscious\nof them and the same subject for each act of their self-attribution.\nThis objection does not beg the question in Kant\u2019s dispute with\nHume, since it assumes only a claim that uncommitted and reasonable\nparticipants in this discussion would not want to initially deny, that\nthe conscious subject of these apperceptive self-attributions is the\nsame. Hume\u2019s theory lacks the resources to account for this\nidentity. Hume himself provides no account of apperception, but\npossibilities for a Humean account are that apperceptive consciousness\namounts to perceptions that are intrinsically self-conscious, or else\nconsists in perceptions of perceptions. But intrinsically\nself-conscious perceptions would be distinct from one another, as\nwould perceptions of perceptions; and thus they too would be\n\u201cdispersed\u201d (B133), and share no common element. Hume\nmight propose to explain our sense of the identity of the conscious\nsubject of different self-attributions by the intrinsically\nself-conscious perceptions or the perceptions of perceptions being\ncomponents of a single causally coherent bundle. However, this bundle\nwould not itself be conscious of perceptions. Consciousness of\nperceptions would instead be an intrinsic feature of an individual\nself-conscious perception or a feature of individual perceptions of a\nperception. In Kant\u2019s conception, by contrast, accounting for\nour sense of the identity of the conscious subject of different\nself-attributions requires that this subject be distinct from its\nrepresentations.\n\nThe second stage of the argument of \u00a716 highlights another\nimplication of the claim that \u201cthe empirical consciousness,\nwhich accompanies different representations, is dispersed and without\nrelation to the identity of the subject\u201d (B133): that\nHume\u2019s theory lacks the resources to account for my\nrepresentation-relation to the identity of the subject; that\nis, this view cannot explain how I can \u201crepresent to myself the\nidentity of the consciousness in [i.e. throughout] these\nrepresentations\u201d (B133) (for an opposing view see Dickerson\n2004: 95\u20138). We might imagine several kinds of explanation for\nmy representation of this identity. One candidate is that inner sense\nallows me to represent this identity: the way I represent the sameness\nof the subject is akin to how I commonly represent the identity over\ntime of ordinary objects \u2013 by a cognitive sensitivity to\nsimilarities among the intrinsic properties represented. However, Kant\nand Hume concur that this is not how I might represent the identity of\nthe apperceiving subject, since they agree that by inner sense I\ncannot represent any intrinsic properties of such a subject. A second\nkind of explanation, which Kant endorses, is that I have an indirect\nway of representing this identity. This representation must instead\ndepend on my apprehending a feature of my representations (or elements\nof them) (Allison 1983: 142\u20134; Guyer 1977: 267, 1987:\n133\u201339; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 147). The appropriate feature is\na type of unity or ordering of these states. The idea is that if the\nrepresentations I can attribute to myself possess a unity of the right\nkind, and if I apprehend or am cognitively sensitive to this unity,\nthen I will be able to represent the apperceiving subject of any one\nof them as identical with that of any other.\n\nThus my representation of the identity of the subject comes about\n\u201conly in so far as I conjoin one representation with another,\nand am conscious of the synthesis of them\u201d (B133). This\nconsciousness is profitably interpreted as conscious awareness not of\nthe act or process of synthesis itself, but rather of the unity that\nis its outcome (Strawson 1966: 94\u20136; Dicker 2004: 133\u20134)).\nWhat sort of unity must I consciously recognize among my\nrepresentations that would account for my representation of this\nidentity? Note that it is not plausibly co-consciousness, for I\nrepresent the subject as identical for self-attributed representations\nthat are not co-conscious, so actual co-consciousness could not\nexplain generally how I represent this sort of identity. A credible\nalternative is that the unity consists in certain intimate ways in\nwhich representations in a single subject are typically related.\nArguably, the essential feature of this unity is that a single\nsubject\u2019s representations be inferentially and causally\nintegrated to a high degree, and in this respect they are unified in a\nway in which representations possessed by discrete subjects are not.\nAlternatively, several commentators have argued that the relevant\nunity might be a temporal order among my representations, thereby\nlinking the B-Deduction with the arguments of the Second Analogy and\nthe Refutation of Idealism (Guyer 1977: 267; Dicker 2004:\n137\u201344). A concern about this route is that a cognitive\nsensitivity to the time-ordering of representations does not obviously\nfacilitate our representing them as belonging to a single subject\n(Brueckner 1984: 199\u2013208). By contrast, when mental states fail\nto exhibit inferential and causal integration, as in the case of\nmultiple-personality disorder, we have a tendency to posit multiple\nsubjects, while we do not do so when such integration is present.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s view, the candidates for explaining how this kind of\nunity comes to be, or, less ambitiously, for explaining my ability to\nrecognize this sort of unity, are association and synthesis. At this\npoint he appears to suppose that because Hume\u2019s psychological\ntheory has already been ruled out, synthesis is the only remaining\noption. So for me to represent the identity of the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions, I must generate or at least recognize the\nright sort of unity among these representations, and synthesis must be\ninvoked to account for this unity. Thus Kant contends that this\ncombination \u201cis an affair of the understanding alone, which\nitself is nothing but the faculty of combining a\npriori\u201d (B134\u20135. Since the understanding provides\nconcepts for synthesis, and because for synthesis to be a\npriori is, at least in part, for it to employ a priori\nconcepts, Kant is contending here that synthesis by means of a\npriori concepts is required to account for the unity in\nquestion.\n\nHere is an austere representation of the structure of the argument so\nfar:\n\nI am conscious of the identity of myself as the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (premise)\nI am not directly conscious of the identity of this subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (premise)\nIf (1) and (2) are true, then this consciousness of identity is\naccounted for indirectly by my consciousness of a particular kind of\nunity of my mental states. (premise)\nThis consciousness of identity is accounted for indirectly by my\nconsciousness of a particular kind of unity of my mental states. (1,\n2, 3)\nIf (4) is true, then my mental states indeed have this particular\nkind of unity. (premise)\nThis particular kind of unity of my mental states cannot be\naccounted for by association. (5, premise)\nIf (6) is true, then this particular kind of unity of my mental\nstates is accounted for by synthesis by a priori concepts.\n(premise)\nThis particular kind of unity of my mental states is accounted for\nby synthesis by a priori concepts. (6, 7)\n\n\nPremise (1) is intended as a claim the skeptic about the legitimate\napplicability of a priori concepts will at least initially\naccept. The crucial necessary conditions, expressed by (3) and (7),\nare necessary conditions of only possible explanation. However, Paul\nGuyer forcefully argues that establishing the need for synthesis by\nmeans of a priori concepts would require ruling out the\nalternative explanation that empirical information and concepts\nderived from it is sufficient to account for the recognition of the\nunity at issue (Guyer 1987:146\u20137). And in his view it remains\nopen, given what Kant has shown, that this recognition requires only\nawareness of information derived from inner sense or introspective\nexperience. Kant does not attempt at this point in the argument to\nrule out such a rival empiricist hypothesis, but he arguably would\nneed to do so to establish the need for a priori synthesis.\nTo advance his claims, one might appeal to features of this unity that\nwould render such an empiricist account inadequate. As we shall see,\nKant employs this tactic in the next phase of the argument, which\nintroduces his account of our representations of objects.\n",
