For each of the studies, there was rarely uniformity in\nbehavior by all the participants in a particular situation. Indeed, in\nsome cases there were striking differences. For instance, we saw that\nin the Forsythe study of dictator games, 21% gave nothing and 21% gave\nthe equal amount of $10, leaving 58% somewhere in-between (Forsythe et\nal.  1994: 362). We also saw that many people would pay $9 to take an\nexit option in Dana\u2019s dictator studies, but many people also\nwould not (Dana et al. 2006). Or in Batson\u2019s studies, many\nparticipants would assign themselves to the positive consequence task,\nbut rarely would everyone do this.\nSo there appear to be important individual differences in behavior\namong participants in these game environments. Since the situation a\ngiven group of participants is confronting is the same, it is only\nnatural to think that the ensuing differences in behavior might be\nexplained, at least in part, by differences in their underlying\npersonality traits. If this turns out to be the case, then if we learn\nsomething about their personality, we could more accurately predict\nhow they would subsequently behave in these games, as well as in other\nrelevant situations. In other words, individual differences in the\nmoral psychology of a person\u2019s justice relevant traits, can\ntranslate into individual differences in justice relevant\nbehavior. And knowing something about the former can help us predict\nthe latter.\nIt turns out that there is in fact some evidence linking certain\npersonality traits with behavior in these games. Here I briefly\nmention three such instances where evidence has been found. Spending a\nmoment on each of them is also worthwhile because of what we can learn\nmore generally about the moral psychology of justice beyond what\neconomic games tell us (for a massive meta-analysis of 60 years of research on the relationship between personality traits and behavior in six economic games, including the dictator and ultimatum games, see Thielmann et al. 2020).\nThe Big Five. The Big Five personality traits (or\nFive-Factor model) have come to dominate the field of personality,\nwith thousands of relevant papers appearing in just the past five\nyears (for an overview, see John et al. 2008). Results from these\nstudies have repeatedly pointed in the direction of five basic\ndimensions of personality with the following most commonly used\nlabels:\n\n\nExtraversion (also labeled Surgency, Energy, Enthusiasm)\nAgreeableness (also labeled Altruism, Affection)\nConscientiousness (also labeled Constraint, Control of Impulse)\nNeuroticism (also labeled Emotional Instability, Negative Emotionality, Nervousness)\nOpenness (also labeled Intellect, Culture, Originality, Open-Mindedness)\n\n\nThe idea, then, is that in a typical group there will be people who\ndiffer in their ratings on each of these five dimensions. Some, for\ninstance, might be high on extraversion, which can be interpreted as\ninvolving an energetic approach towards social interaction manifested\nin, for instance, the behavior of attending more parties and\nintroducing themselves to strangers (John et al. 2008: 120). Others\nmight be quite introverted instead.\nAdvocates of this approach typically have hierarchical models of\npersonality traits in mind, where the Big Five are subdivided into\ndifferent \u201cfacets\u201d that are less broad and so are claimed\nto have increased accuracy (for details, see Paunonen 1998). To cite\none example, here are the 30 facets from Robert McCrae and Paul\nCosta\u2019s version of the Five-Factor Model (Costa and McCrae 1995:\n28):\n\n\n Neuroticism: Anxiety, Angry Hostility, Depression,\nSelf-Consciousness, Impulsiveness, Vulnerability\n Extraversion: Warmth, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity,\nExcitement Seeking, Positive Emotions\n Openness to Experience: Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings, Actions,\nIdeas, Values\n Agreeableness: Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance,\nModesty, Tender-Mindedness\n Conscientiousness: Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement\nStriving, Self-Discipline, Deliberation\n\n\nIn their 240 item survey instrument, the NEO-PI-R, 8 items are\ndesigned to measure each of these facets. For instance, \u201cI keep\nmy belongings neat and clean\u201d and \u201cI like to keep\neverything in its place so I know just where it is\u201d are two\nitems for the consciousness facet of order (Costa and McCrae 1992:\n73).\nIt is noteworthy that there is nothing on the list of Big Five\ntraits or their facets that seems directly related to justice. But in\nrecent years connections have been established between performance on\neconomic games and the Big Five (for a review, see Zhao and Smillie\n2015). The most pronounced finding among the Big Five traits is that\nhigher agreeableness is correlated with higher allocations to the\nrecipient in a dictator game. In one meta-analysis, the sample\nweighted average correlation was \\(r_{wa} = .18\\). A negative\ncorrelation of \\(r_{wa} = -.10\\) was also found for rejecting fewer\noffers in ultimatum games (Zhao and Smillie 2015:\n288). Conscientiousness has also been linked to lower allocations in\ndictator games (Ben-Ner et al.  2004). Studies on the other Big Five\ntraits have been more inconsistent in their results, and are also few\nand far between.\nThe HEXACO. Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee have proposed a\nsix-factor model of personality (Ashton & Lee 2001, 2005 and Lee\n& Ashton 2004). Five of the factors carry over with minor\nmodifications from the Big Five taxonomy. The key addition is a sixth\nfactor which they call honesty-humility, and which they describe this\nway:\n Persons with very high scores on the Honesty-Humility\nscale avoid manipulating others for personal gain, feel little\ntemptation to break rules, are uninterested in lavish wealth and\nluxuries, and feel no special entitlement to elevated social\nstatus. Conversely, persons with very low scores on this scale will\nflatter others to get what they want, are inclined to break rules for\npersonal profit, are motivated by material gain, and feel a strong\nsense of self-importance. (Lee & Ashton 2015, Other Internet\nResources).\nHonesty-humility in turn has four facets: sincerity, fairness,\ngreed avoidance, and modesty. Most relevant for our purposes is\nnaturally the fairness facet. As part of the 100-item HEXACO-PI-R\ninventory, the following are the items which are labeled under\nfairness:\n\n12.\n If I knew that I could never get caught, I would be willing to\nsteal a million dollars.\n36.\n I would be tempted to buy stolen property if I were financially\ntight.\n60.\n I would never accept a bribe, even if it were very\nlarge.\n84.\n I\u2019d be tempted to use counterfeit money, if I were sure I\ncould get away with it.\n\nNow one might wonder about whether these are really best understood\nas fairness items. They might seem to relate at the\nconceptual level more to honesty than to justice. But let\u2019s\nleave that terminological point to one side.\nFor it turns out that significant statistical relationships have\nbeen found with behavior in bargaining games (for a review, see Zhao\nand Smillie 2015). In the same meta-analysis, for instance, the sample\nweighted average correlation was \\(r_{wa} = .24\\) between dictator\nallocation amount and honesty-humility (291). Another meta-analysis\nreported a correlation of \\(r_{wa} = .29\\) (Hilbig et al. 2015:\n92). So too was there a negative correlation between HEXACO\nagreeableness and rejecting offers in ultimatum games (\\(r_{wa}=\n-.16\\)) (Zhao and Smillie 2015: 288). Furthermore, one study found\nthat of those who were high in honesty-humility, 64.4% chose the 50/50\nallocation in the dictator game, while only 34.6% did who were low on\nthis dimension (Hilbig et al. 2015: 92).\nBenjamin Hilbig and Ingo Zettler (2009) provide a nice experimental\ndemonstration of this relationship. Participants completed the\nHEXACO-PI and played a dictator game and an ultimatum game with an\ninitial allocation of 100 points for each game. As expected, those who\nwere higher in honesty-humility gave fewer points to themselves in\nboth games (518). More interesting was the consistency in\nallocations between the two games. Those lowest in\nhonesty-humility allocated an almost equal amount of points to\nthemselves and the other person in the ultimatum game. But in the\ndictator game, where there was no threat of rejection by the other\nperson, the average allocation for participants to keep was almost 80\npoints. By way of contrast, those highest in honesty-humility showed\nno significant difference in their allocations in the two games. In\nother words, they were consistently fair, whereas the other group of\nparticipants was only being fair when it was to their advantage\n(518\u2013519).\nJustice Sensitivity. A relatively new and particularly\nexciting development in personality psychology has been the study of\nwhat is being called \u201cjustice sensitivity\u201d. The basic idea\nis that individuals differ in general on this trait, which can be\nunderstood at its heart as a motive for justice (Stavrova and\nSchl\u00f6sser 2015: 3). After several refinements, consensus seems to be\nemerging around four facets for this trait (Schmitt et al. 2010;\nStavrova and Schl\u00f6sser 2015):\n\nJSVictim: Sensitivity to becoming a victim of\ninjustice.\nJSObserver: Sensitivity to witnessing injustice.\nJSBeneficiary: Sensitivity to passively benefiting from\ninjustice.\nJSPerpetrator: Sensitivity to actively committing\ninjustice.\n (Stavrova and Schl\u00f6sser 2015: 3)\n\nThree of these\u2014observer, beneficiary, and perpetrator\nsensitivity\u2014are other-focused aspects of justice sensitivity,\nwhereas victim sensitivity is self-focused on one\u2019s being\ntreated fairly (Stavrova and Schl\u00f6sser 2015: 3; Schl\u00f6sser et al. 2018: 76\u201377). This makes a\ndifference statistically. For instance, victim sensitivity tends to\ncorrelate with anti-social personality traits\u2014such as\nMachiavellianism\u2014in a way that the first three do not.\nBut all four of these facets are indeed statistically related to\neach other, and at the same time are distinguishable pieces of a\nstable trait of justice sensitivity. While they do correlate with\nother personality traits such as the Big Five, the correlations are\ntypically on the low side, which can be taken as evidence that justice\nsensitivity itself is a distinct trait (for a review, see Schmitt et\nal. 2010).\n A well validated measure of justice sensitivity has been developed\nby Manfred Schmitt and his colleagues, with 10 items for each of the\nfour facets (Schmitt et al. 2010). For instance, here are the items\nfor beneficiary sensitivity:\n\n\nIt disturbs me when I receive what others ought to have.\nI have a bad conscience when I receive a reward that someone else\nhas earned.\nI cannot easily bear it to unilaterally profit from others.\nIt takes me a long time to forget when others have to fix my\ncarelessness.\nIt disturbs me when I receive more opportunities than others to\ndevelop my skills.\nI feel guilty when I am better off than others for no reason.\nIt bothers me when things come easily to me that others have to\nwork hard for.\nI ruminate for a long time about being treated nicer than others\nfor no reason.\nIt bothers me when someone tolerates things with me that other\npeople are being criticized for.\nI feel guilty when I receive better treatment than others. \n           (Schmitt et al. 2010: 234)\n\n\nParticipants complete these items using a scale which ranges from 0\n(not at all) to 5 (exactly).\nUsing this measure of justice sensitivity, some interesting work is\nbeing done. For instance, Gollwitzer and his colleagues (2005)\nexamined the willingness of West Germans to contribute to East Germany\nto help improve living conditions, as there is a large disparity even\nyears after the wall came down. Some particular proposals included an\nautomatic deduction from the salaries of West Germans that would be\nused for job creation in East Germany, and the implementation of\naffirmative action hiring policies which would favor East over West\nGermans for new positions. It turned out that beneficiary sensitivity,\nfor instance, was found to predict solidarity with East Germans,\nwhereas victim sensitivity did not (Gollwitzer et al. 2005: 191).\nIn another study, Thomas Schl\u00f6sser and his colleagues (2018) examined whether justice sensitivity predicts wealth distribution. They used a version of the welfare state game in which participants were assigned to be an upper, middle, or lower class subject in a hypothetical society which they got to help shape. Specifically they chose between a society with lower inequality (person A received \u20ac5, B received \u20ac4, and C received \u20ac3) versus higher overall wealth but greater inequality (A received \u20ac10, B received \u20ac6, and C received \u20ac1). As expected, participants who were high on JSVictim (sensitivity to becoming a victim of injustice) were more likely to go with greater inequality if they were A or B, but greater equality if they were C. Participants who were high on the other three dimensions of justice sensitivity were more likely to choose less inequality regardless of whether they were A, B, or C (Schl\u00f6sser et al. 2018: 79).\nMost relevant for our purposes, participants who are high on victim\nsensitivity are less likely to allocate 50/50 in dictator games,\nwhereas the opposite is true for the other facets of justice\nsensitivity. Hence Detlef Fetchenhauer and Xu Huang (2004) found that\nobserver sensitivity correlated .21 with an equal allocation, and\nperpetrator sensitivity correlated .30. On the other hand, victim\nsensitivity was negatively correlated at \u2212.18 (Fetchenhauer and\nHuang 2004: 1024).\nFurther research in this area of the moral psychology of justice\nlooks to be especially promising in the years to come (for additional\nnoteworthy studies, see Dalbert and Umlauft 2009; Lotz et al 2013;\nEdele et al. 2013).\n",
