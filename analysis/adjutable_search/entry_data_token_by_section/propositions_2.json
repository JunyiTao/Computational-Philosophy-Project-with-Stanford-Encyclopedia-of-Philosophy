The Relational Analysis\n\nBy our stipulation, \u2018proposition\u2019 is used to pick out the\nobjects of the attitudes and the bearers of truth and falsity. One\nwould therefore expect that if there are propositions, they would\nfigure importantly in the semantics of attitude- and\ntruth-ascriptions. One would expect, in particular, that in\n\u2018\\(S\\) believes that \\(p\\)\u2019, and in \u2018that \\(p\\) is\ntrue\u2019, the that-clauses would refer to\n propositions.[3]\n\nOne might doubt whether that-clauses could really\nrefer, if reference is understood on the model of proper\nnames. For, that-clauses are not proper names, nor are they\nnoun\n phrases.[4]\n Still, because propositions are the objects of the attitudes and the\nbearers of truth, mustn\u2019t they somehow be semantically\nassociated with ascriptions of attitudes and of truth? Following\nJeffrey King (2002), we will use the term \u2018designate\u2019 as a\ncatch-all covering any sort of semantic association between a\nlinguistic item and an entity. We follow standard terminology in using\nthe word \u2018express\u2019 to pick out the relation between a\npredicate and the property which is its sense or semantic content.\n\nMore carefully, then, the propositionalist will find it natural to\naccept the following account of attitude-ascriptions:\n\nThe Relational Analysis of Attitude Ascriptions:\n An attitude ascription \u2018\\(S\\) \\(V\\)s that \\(p\\)\u2019 is\ntrue iff \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 designates a person who stands in the\nattitude relation expressed by \u2018\\(V\\)\u2019 to the proposition\ndesignated by \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 (and false iff\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 designates a person who doesn\u2019t stand in\nsuch relation to such a proposition).\n\n\nAnalogously, there is:\n\nThe Property Analysis of Truth-Ascriptions:\n \u2018That \\(p\\) is true\u2019 or \u2018it is true that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 is true iff the proposition designated by \u2018that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 has the property expressed by \u2018true\u2019.\n\n\nOne of the great advantages of these analyses\u2014the combination of\nwhich we will simply call The Relational Analysis\u2014is\nthe smooth explanation of the validity of certain inferences.\nConsider, for example:\n\nCharles believes everything Thomas said.\n\nThomas said that cats purr.\n\nSo, Charles believes that cats purr.\n\nSomething Barbara asserted is true.\n\nNothing John denied is true.\n\nSo, something Barbara asserted John did not deny.\n\nJohn believes that every even is the sum of two primes.\n\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture is that every even is the sum of two\nprimes.\n\nSo, John believes Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture.\n\nThese inferences are valid if they have the following simple logical\nforms:\n\nFor all \\(x\\) such that Thomas said \\(x\\), Charlie believes \\(x\\).\n\nThomas said \\(A\\).\n\nSo, Charlie believes \\(A\\).\n\nSome \\(x\\) such that Barbara asserted \\(x\\) is true.\n\nNo \\(x\\) such that John denied \\(x\\) is true.\n\nSo, some \\(x\\) such that Barbara asserted \\(x\\) is such that John did\nnot deny \\(x\\).\n\nJohn believes \\(A\\).\n\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture is \\(A\\).\n\nSo, John believes Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture.\n\nWe will discuss problems for the Relational Analysis in Section\n 5.[5]\n3.2. Meanings of Sentences\n\nPropositions are also commonly treated as the meanings or, to use the\nmore standard terminology, the semantic contents of\nsentences, and so are commonly taken to be central to semantics and\nthe philosophy of language. However, there is room for doubt about\nwhether propositions are the right sort of entity for the job (Lewis\n1980). Here is why. Note that a sentence would appear to contribute\nthe same content regardless of whether it occurs as a proper part of a\nlarger sentence. So, a sentence such as \u2018in the past, Reagan was\npresident\u2019 would seem to be true depending on whether the\ncontent of \u2018Reagan is president\u2019 is true at some past\ntime. But this would seem to imply that this content must lack\ntemporal qualification\u2014that it can change in its truth-value\nover time. Similarly, it seems there are locative sentential operators\n\u2018in Chicago, it is raining\u2019. If so, then by a similar\nargument, it would seem that the content of \u2018it is\nraining\u2019 would have to lack spatial qualification. The problem\nis this: it seems propositions, being the objects of belief,\ncannot in general be spatially and temporally unqualified. Suppose\nthat Smith, in London, looks out his window and forms the belief that\nit is raining. Suppose that Ramirez, in Madrid, relying on\nyesterday\u2019s weather report, awakens and forms the belief that it\nis raining, before looking out the window to see sunshine. What Smith\nbelieves is true, while what Ramirez believes is false. So they must\nnot believe the same proposition. But if propositions were generally\nspatially unqualified, they would believe the same proposition. An\nanalogous argument can be given to show that what is believed must not\nin general be temporally unqualified.\n\nIf these worries are well-taken, then the meanings or contents of\nsentences are not in general propositions.\n\nAppealing to recent work in linguistics, Jeffrey C. King (2003)\npresents evidence against one of the crucial assumptions of the above\narguments, that there are no genuine locational or temporal operators\nin English. King claims that \u2018somewhere\u2019 and\n\u2018sometimes\u2019 are better regarded as quantifiers over\nlocational and temporal entities (i.e., either locations and times\nthemselves or locational or temporal properties of events). Thus,\n\u2018somewhere, it is raining\u2019 would have the logical form\n\u2018there is some location \\(L\\) such that it is raining at\n\\(L\\)\u2019. King further argues that tenses are best analyzed as\nquantifiers over times rather than temporal operators. \u2018John\nflunked chemistry\u2019, thus, would have the form \u2018there is\nsome time \\(t\\) within \\(I^*\\) such that John flunks chemistry at\n\\(t\\)\u2019, where the interval \\(I^*\\) is contextually supplied.\nThese analyses, of course, require the controversial claim that\npredicates like \u2018is raining\u2019 and \u2018flunks \u2019\ninclude extra argument places for locations and times.\n\nKing emphasizes that his argument is thoroughly empirical. It relies\non results from empirical linguistics. If King is right, however, the\nview that the contents of sentences are propositions can be\nmaintained.\n\nFor other criticisms of Lewis\u2019s argument, see Richard (1982),\nSalmon (1989) and Cappelen and Hawthorne (2010). Brogaard (2012)\nprovides a defense of the temporalist view of\n propositions.[6]\n4. Arguments for Propositions\n4.1 One over Many\n\nOne familiar argument for propositions appeals to commonalities\nbetween beliefs, utterances, or sentences, and infers a common entity.\nThus, it has been suggested, less in print perhaps than in\nconversation, that propositions are needed to play the role of being\nwhat synonymous sentences have in common, what a sentence and its\ntranslation into another language have in common, etc.\n\nArguments of this sort are typically met with the following reply:\ncommonalities do not necessarily require common relations to a single\nentity. Two red things have something in common, in that they are both\nred, but it does not follow that they bear a common relation\nto a single entity, the universal of redness. Similarly, two\nsentences, in virtue of being synonymous, can be said to have\nsomething in common, but that fact alone does not entail they are\ncommonly related to a proposition. When a relation \\(R\\) is symmetric\nand reflexive with respect to a certain domain, it may be useful to\nspeak of the things in the domain which bear \\(R\\) to one another as\n\u201chaving something in common\u201d, but nothing of ontological\nsignificance follows. Thus, the conclusion is drawn: we need an\nargument for thinking that commonalities require common relations to a\nsingle entity.\n4.2 Metalinguistic Arguments\n\nOne standard sort of argument for propositions is metalinguistic.\nThus, many argue that we think of that-clauses as designating\nexpressions if we are to explain how certain argument patterns (such\nas those considered in Section 2) are valid and in fact have sound\ninstances (Horwich 1990, Higginbotham 1991, Schiffer 1996, Bealer\n1998). Since some of these sound argument instances contain as\npremises sentences attributing truth to the designata of\nthat-clauses, those designata must be bearers of\ntruth-values. Similarly, premises of some of these sound instances\nascribe attitudes toward the designatum of a that-clauses,\nthese designata would seem to be objects of attitudes. In brief, in\norder to explain these facts about validity and soundness, it seems\nthat-clauses must not only designate but must designate\nentities fitting the propositional role.\n\nWhether propositions are needed for the semantics of natural language\nis a matter of continuing dispute. For more on these matters, see the\nentry on\n theories of meaning.\n4.3 The Metaphysics 101 Argument\n\nOur focus here will be on a different sort of argument. Here is a\nspeech the basic character of which should be familiar to\nundergraduate students of metaphysics:\n\nWhen someone has a belief, we can distinguish what she\nbelieves from her believing it. I have a belief that\nHomer wrote The Iliad, for example. We can distinguish\nwhat I believe in believing that Homer wrote The\nIliad\u2014the content of my belief\u2014from my believing\nthat Homer wrote The Iliad. What I believe in believing this is\nsomething you believe, too. What we both believe is the proposition\nthat Homer wrote The Iliad. This same proposition may be\nasserted, doubted, etc. And, in fact, this proposition is true: Homer\nwrote The Iliad. So, there are propositions, and they are the\ncontents of beliefs and other attitudes and they are the bearers of\ntruth and falsity.\n\n\nOne might attempt to regiment these remarks, somewhat artificially, to\ntake the form of an argument, which we will dub the Metaphysics\n101 argument:\n\n\nWith respect to any belief, there is what is believed and\nthe believing of it, and these are distinct.\nWhat is believed is something that may be rejected, denied,\ndisbelieved, etc. by multiple subjects, and is something that may be\ntrue or false.\nThere are beliefs.\nSo, there are propositions (i.e, sharable objects of the attitudes\nand bearers of truth-values).\n\n\n\nFurther tinkering might improve the argument in certain ways. Our\nconcern, however, is whether the argument goes seriously awry.\n\nThe Metaphysics 101 Argument is not metalinguistic. It does not rely\non premises about English. This can be verified by noting that the\nargument looks just as good after it is translated into other\nlanguages. Nevertheless, it might be claimed that the argument derives\nits apparent force from a seductive mistake about how English (and\nother languages) function. Perhaps this is another case of what\nWittgenstein called \u201clanguage on\n holiday.\u201d[7]\n5. Linguistic Problems?\n\nHow might one reply to the arguments for propositions just discussed?\nOne might reply, of course, by arguing for the opposite conclusion.\nThus, many have argued, on broadly naturalistic grounds, that we ought\nnot accept propositions. Any such argument will involve controversial\nclaims about the nature and status of propositions. These issues are\ndiscussed in section 7. However, one increasingly popular reply to\narguments for propositions is to argue, (1), that they presuppose the\nRelational Analysis, and (2), that the Relational Analysis does a poor\njob of accounting for certain linguistic data.\n5.1 The Substitution Problem\n\nThe problem here is quite simple. If, as the Relational Analysis\nentails, attitude-ascriptions of the form \u2018\\(S\\) \\(V\\)s that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 assert relations to propositions, then we should be able\nto replace \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 with \u2018the proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 without affecting truth-value. But in general we\ncan\u2019t do this. Therefore, the Relational Analysis is false. Here\nare some examples of failed substitutions:\n\n1.\nI insist that it will snow this year. (TRUE)\n*2.\nSo, I insist the proposition that it will snow this year.\n\n\n3.\nI imagine that it will snow this year. (TRUE)\n4.\nSo, I imagine the proposition that it will snow this year.\n(FALSE)\n\n\n5.\nI remember that combustion produces phlogiston. (FALSE)\n6.\nI remember the proposition that combustion produces phlogiston.\n(TRUE).\n\n\nThe class of attitude verbs for which substitution problems\narise\u2014the \u201cproblematic\u201d attitude verbs\u2014can be\ndivided into two subclasses: one consisting of verbs which do not\ngrammatically tolerate substitutions (e.g., intransitive verbs such as\n\u2018insist\u2019, \u2018complain\u2019, \u2018say\u2019, and\nVPs of the form \u2018Aux Adj\u2019, such as \u2018is\npleased\u2019, \u2018was surprised\u2019); the other consisting of\nverbs which grammatically tolerate substitutions but for which\ntruth-value is not necessarily preserved (e.g., \u2018expect\u2019,\n\u2018anticipate\u2019, \u2018bet\u2019, \u2018gather\u2019,\n\u2018judge\u2019, \u2018claim\u2019, \u2018maintain\u2019,\n\u2018hold\u2019, \u2018feel\u2019, \u2018remember\u2019,\n\u2018know\u2019, \u2018recognize\u2019, \u2018find\u2019).\n\nFriederike Moltmann (2003) dubs this problem the Substitution\nProblem. (See also Vendler 1967, Prior 1971, Parsons 1993, Bach\n1997, McKinsey 1999, Recanati 2000, King 2002, Moffett 2003, Harman\n2003.)\n5.2 The Objectivization Effect\n\nClosely related to the Substitution Problem is what Moltmann (2003, p.\n87) calls the Objectivization Effect, or objectivization.\nSubstitutions in some cases seem to force a new reading for the verb,\nan object reading rather than a content reading.\nThus, in \u2018I imagine that it will snow this year,\u2019\n\u2018imagine\u2019 has the content reading (this is, by\nstipulation, what the content reading is!), whereas in \u2018I\nimagine the proposition that it will snow this year,\u2019\n\u2018imagine\u2019 takes an object reading\u2014it expresses the\nsame relation that holds between subjects and garden variety objects\nsuch as those designated by NPs like \u201819th-century Wessex\u2019\nand \u2018my college roommate\u2019.\n\nThe problem here can be described as follows. If the Relational\nAnalysis is true, then propositional attitudes are relations to\npropositions; but then it seems very odd that we should be unable to\nretain the content meaning by substituting \u2018the proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 for \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019.\n5.3 Defensive Responses\n\nDefensive Response #1. The above arguments against the\nRelational Analysis prove too much. Similar problems arise for the\nappeal to facts (as distinct from true propositions), properties, and\nevents in semantics. Here are several examples of substitution\nfailures.\n\n\\(S\\) found that the room was a mess.\n\nSo, \\(S\\) found the fact that the room was a mess. \n\nFreedom is on the march.\n\nSo, the property of freedom is on the march. \n\nI jumped a jump.\n\nSo, I jumped an event (of jumping). \n\nA difficulty for Defensive Response #1 is that it seems to spread a\nproblem around rather than solve it. One might argue that relational\nanalyses invoking propositions, facts, properties, and events all make\nthe same mistake of reading too much ontology into English.\n\nDefensive Response #2. From \u2018\\(S\\) believes that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 we can infer \u2018\\(S\\) believes the\nproposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(S\\) believes a\nproposition.\u2019 And the same goes for \u2018reject\u2019,\n\u2018assert\u2019, \u2018deny\u2019, and many other attitude\nverbs. If we concede that these sentences assert relations to\npropositions, then we are conceding that there are propositions.\n\nApart from such defensive replies, though, the relationalist might\nattempt to solve the problems. We will discuss several approaches.\n5.4 The Syntax Response\n\nNext, following Jeffrey King (2002), the propositionalist might give a\npurely syntactic answer to the problems. King (pp. 345\u20136)\nclaims, first, that there is a very simple syntactic explanation for\nthe substitution failures that produce ungrammaticalities: such verbs\ndon\u2019t take NP complements at all, and so don\u2019t take\nnominal complements, which are NP complements. (A verb can take\nthat-clause complements without taking NP complements,\nbecause that-clauses are not NPs.) One might say something\nsimilar, for example, about why we cannot substitute descriptions for\nnames in apposition (e.g., \u2018The philosopher Plato believed in\nuniversals\u2019 is true but \u2018the philosopher the teacher of\nAristotle believed in universals\u2019 is not true.) King claims,\nsecond, that the other class of failures are explained by shifts in\nverb meanings (i.e., because of objectivization). These shifts are due\nto syntactical matters, in particular the syntactic category of the\nverb complement. If the complement is an NP, the verb has an object\nmeaning. If it is a that-clause, it has the content meaning.\nKing recognizes the need for qualifications: verbs in the problematic\nclass can have the content reading with certain special NPs, e.g.,\nquantifiers (\u2018everything Bill holds, Bob holds\u2019), and\nanaphoric pronouns (\u2018I hold that, too\u2019.). In the final\nanalysis, King claims only that all the syntactic properties of the\ncomplement (and not just its general syntactic category) determine the\nverb\u2019s meaning when taking that\n complement.[8]\n5.5 Semantic Responses\n\nThe relationalist might respond by making claims about the semantics\nof that-clauses, \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, or\nsome combination of these. We discuss two such proposals here.\n\nFirst, the relationalist might claim that-clauses are\nambiguous, and in particular that they pick out different kinds of\nentities depending on which attitude verb they complement. How do we\ntell what kinds of entities are picked out? We look at substitution\nfailures. Thus, it might be argued the truth of \u2018\\(S\\) remembers\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019 requires that the subject bear the remembering\nrelation to a fact, rather than a proposition. After all,\n\u2018remember\u2019 shows substitution failures for \u2018the\n(true) proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 but not for \u2018the fact that\n\\(p\\)\u2019.\n\nHowever, there are obstacles to this response. For one thing, some\nattitude verbs seem not to permit substitutions no matter which\nnominal complement is chosen. King (2002) gives the example of\n\u2018feel\u2019. What sorts of entities, then, do\nthat-clauses designate when they complement\n\u2018feel\u2019? No answer is possible. Is the Relational Analysis\ntherefore false of such verbs? Perhaps even more damaging, there are\nverbs which are near synonyms of \u2018believes\u2019, at least in\nattitude ascriptions, and which grammatically take NP complements, but\nwhich exhibit substitution failures and objectivization.\n\u2018Feel\u2019 is one example, as are \u2018maintain\u2019,\n\u2018hold\u2019, \u2018judge\u2019, \u2018expect\u2019, and\n\u2018suspect\u2019. How could \u2018believes\u2019 designate a\nrelation to propositions in attitude ascriptions but these verbs not?\nConsider also the near-synonyms \u2018assert\u2019 and\n\u2018claim\u2019.\n\nEven if the ambiguity hypothesis cannot provide the propositionalist\nwith a general solution to the Substitution Problem and the\nObjectivization Effect, it may help in explaining other\nlinguistic phenomena, such as the distributional differences between\nvarious nominal complements (\u2018the fact that \\(p\\)\u2019,\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, \u2018the possibility that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, etc.). (See Vendler 1967 and Moffett 2003.)\n\nNebel (2019) proposes an alternate strategy. He maintains the\ntraditional view that that-clauses designate propositions,\nbut argues that \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 does not.\nCall phrases of the form \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019\nproposition descriptions. Proposition descriptions, on this\nview, denote propositional concepts\u2014functions from\nsituations to propositions. This is motivated by a puzzle from Partee\n(1974):\n\nThe number of insect species on Earth is increasing.\n\nThe number of insect species on Earth is 5.5 million.\n\nTherefore, 5.5 million is increasing.\n\nTo explain this argument\u2019s invalidity, Montague (1973) argued\nthat \u2018the number of insect species\u2019 does not denote a\nnumber, but an individual concept\u2014a function from situations\n(world-time pairs) to individuals (in this case, a number). The copula\nin the second premise specifies, rather than equates, the value of the\nindividual concept relative to this situation.\n\nNebel presents an analogous puzzle involving a proposition-like\ndescription:\n\nThe evidence that vaccines cause autism is that vaccines contain\nthiomersal\n\nThe evidence that vaccines cause autism is scant.\n\nTherefore, that vaccines contain thiomersal is scant.\n\nTo explain the invalidity of this argument, Nebel claims that\n\u2018the evidence that \\(p\\)\u2019 does not denote a proposition,\nbut a propositional concept\u2014a function from situations to the\nproposition that provides evidence for \\(p\\) in that situation. The\n\u2018is\u2019 of the first premise again specifies the proposition\nthat is the value of the propositional concept in that situation; it\ndoes not state an identity between \u2018the evidence that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018that \\(q\\)\u2019. In general, all proposition\ndescriptions are said to denote propositional concepts. In the case of\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, the propositional concept is\na constant function that designates the same proposition in every\nsituation.\n\nNebel supports this view by noting particular uses of proposition\ndescriptions. Compare the following pairs of statements:\n\n1.\n\n\na.\nThe teacher explained the cause of World War I.\nb.\nThe teacher explained the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.\n\n2.\n\n\na.\nSally explained that Fido barks.\nb.\nSally explained the proposition that Fido barks.\n\n\n\nThe members of each pair have different truth conditions, despite the\nassassination of Franz Ferdinand being the cause of WWI, and the\nproposition that Fido barks being the denotation of \u2018that Fido\nbarks\u2019. To explain this, Nebel appeals to the notion of a\nconcealed question; in certain contexts\u2014for instance,\nwhen the complement of \u2018explains\u2019 is a noun\nphrase\u2014the meaning of the noun phrase is given by an\ninterrogative clause. Thus, (1a) means that the teacher explained\nwhat caused World War I. In the same way, the proposition\ndescription in (2b) conceals a question, although it is a murkier, and\noften context-sensitive, matter exactly which question is concealed.\nNebel suggests that Sally explained what the proposition that Fido\nbarks is, means, or involves.\n\nIf proposition descriptions sometimes function as concealed questions,\nthen it is plausible that they share a semantics with interrogative\nclauses. Interrogative clauses have been taken to denote question\nintensions, functions from situations to propositions that truly\nanswer the question in that situation. If this is correct, then\nquestion intensions are just propositional concepts. Nebel takes this\nto provide evidence for his view: If proposition descriptions denote\npropositional concepts (and not propositions), then we should predict\nthat proposition descriptions can be used as concealed questions in\ncontexts which permit interrogative complements, which is what we\nfind.\n\nSince \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018the proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 denote different entities, Nebel\u2019s proposal seems\nable to explain the substitution failures that result from replacing\nproposition descriptions for that-clauses. It would seem,\nhowever, that on his view inferences from \u2018S believes that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 to \u2018S believes the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019\nwill be invalid. Nebel gives a tentative response that\n\u2018believes\u2019 may be polysemous. Compare the following:\n\n3.\nSally believes that Fido barks.\n4.\nSally believes the proposition that Fido barks.\n5.\nSally believes her mother.\n\n\nIn (3), \u2018believes\u2019 takes a proposition as argument and\nreturns a predicate that is true of Sally iff she believes that\nproposition. In cases like (3), \u2018believes\u2019 takes a\nnon-propositional entity (her mother) as argument and forms a\npredicate that is true of Sally iff she believes some\ncontextually-salient proposition that is associated with her mother.\nNebel proposes that (2) is like (3); in this case, the\ncontextually-salient proposition associated with the propositional\nconcept is that Fido barks. Thus, (1) and (2) have the same truth\nconditions, despite the that-clause and proposition\ndescription denoting different entities.\n\nOne may object that many descriptions which denote proposition-like\nentities (statements, rumors, claims, etc.) can take predicates that\ndon\u2019t apply to abstract objects like propositional concepts. For\nexample, in the sentence \u2018the rumor that Jim consumes peyote is\nvicious,\u2019 the description \u2018the rumor that Jim consumes\npeyote\u2019 is said to denote the function from situations to the\nproposition rumored at that situation. But it seems to be a category\nmistake to say that a propositional concept (or even a proposition) is\nvicious. Similarly, van Elswyk (2022) appeals to points made by\nMoltmann (2013) that certain descriptions permit causal predicates, as\nin \u2018the statement that durian is pungent caused\nastonishment\u2019. On Nebel\u2019s view, \u2018the statement that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 denotes a propositional concept. But if propositional\nconcepts are abstract, then they cannot enter into causal relations.\nOn a more natural reading, the description designates an act of\nstating (or perhaps its product, as Moltmann maintains), which can be\na cause.\n\nFinally, we may ask whether this view can explain the Objectivization\nEffect. If proposition descriptions denote propositional concepts, and\nthese are functions from situations to propositions, then why do we\nget the object readings with proposition descriptions? For \u2018the\nnumber of insect species is increasing\u2019 we do not get an object\nreading for the NP, but a \u201cstructural\u201d reading that makes\nsense if \u2018the number of insects\u2019 denotes an individual\nconcept. The same applies to \u2018the evidence that vaccines cause\nautism is scant\u2019. However, in \u2018John fears the proposition\nthat a bear is behind the tree\u2019, we do not get a structural\nreading. John does not fear the function itself, nor any structural\nfeature of it. We get an objectual reading of the sort King\npredicts.\n5.6 Substitution and Objectivization Problems for Everyone?\n\nAlthough the dominant view in the literature is that the\nSubstitution Problem and the Objectivization Effect\nare problems principally for defenders of the Relational Analysis\n(e.g., Prior 1971, Bach 1997, Recanati 2000, Moltmann 2003; 2004), it\nis intriguing to ask whether some version of these problems arise for\neveryone\u2014friend or foe of the Relational Analysis,\nfriend or foe of propositions.\n\nAs noted above, there are near-synonyms (e.g., the verbs\n\u2018assert\u2019 and \u2018claim\u2019) which are alike in\ntaking nominal complements but which differ with respect to\nsubstitutions. This seems to be a fact that everyone must explain. It\nseems likely that the substitutional differences must be explained in\nterms of shifts in verb meaning. Because substitution does not affect\nthe meaning of \u2018assert\u2019, it must affect the meaning of\n\u2018claim\u2019, and, intuitively, it does. This does leave the\nquestion of how the Objectivization Effect itself is to be\nexplained. But one might hope that a broadly syntactic\nsolution\u2014perhaps like King\u2019s\u2014would be available to\nanyone, regardless of one\u2019s stance on propositions.\n\nIf these problems are problems everyone faces, some heat is taken off\nthe relationalist, and the propositionalist generally.\n\nThat said, the relationalist may have to take account of other\nlinguistic puzzles. She will need to explain why it sounds so\npeculiar, e.g., to talk of \u201cmy believing what you desire, or my\ndreading what the thermometer indicated.\u201d And, even with purely\ncognitive attitude verbs, similar puzzles arise: the mild peculiarity\nof \u201cI doubt/assert what you contemplate/entertain,\u201d for\nexample, will require explanation. (For more on these matters, see\nVendler 1967 and Harman 2003.)\n5.7 Modifying/Replacing the Relational Analysis\n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of argument, the linguistic problems\ndiscussed above undermine the Relational Analysis. Can a\npropositionalist dissociate herself from that analysis, and its\nlinguistic difficulties, while still endorsing the arguments we\ndiscussed for propositions in section 5.1?\n\nSome modifications of the Relational Analysis do not avoid the\nlinguistic problems. For instance, it is not enough to claim that\nattitude verbs designate three-place relations between\nsubjects, propositions, and modes of presentation.\n\nOne possibility is to deny that attitude verbs designate relations\nwhen complemented by that-clauses, and to claim that they\nrather make a syncategorematic semantic contribution. Under one\napproach, that-clauses in attitude ascriptions designate\npropositions which serve to \u201cmeasure\u201d attitudes conceived\nof as mental particulars (Matthews 1994). It is not clear that this\nview will be immune to substitution and objectivization problems. See\nMoltmann (2003) for further discussion.\n\nAnother possibility is to abandon the Relational Analysis altogether,\nin favor of a version of Bertrand Russell\u2019s \u201cmultiple\nrelation\u201d theory. Following Russell (1911; 1913; 1918), Newman\n(2002) and Moltmann (2003; 2004), have recently argued that\nthat-clauses in attitude ascriptions do not designate\npropositions but rather provide a number of entities as terms of a\n\u201cmultiple\u201d attitude relation. These philosophers\nnonetheless do accept propositions, and use them to explain sentences\nin which \u2018proposition\u2019 explicitly occurs, e.g.,\n(\u2018Some proposition that John believes is true\u2019,\n\u2018John believes the proposition that snow is white\u2019). The\nbasic idea is that there are propositions, but they have the status of\n\u201cderived objects\u201d\u2014derived from our attitudes, which\nthemselves are not relations to propositions. It is an interesting\nquestion whether a Russellian is positioned to endorse the arguments\nfor propositions given in section 4. (For more on the Russellian\ntheory, see the supplementary document:\n\nThe Multiple Relation Theory\n\n\nAn alternate proposal which abandons the Relational Analysis takes\nthat-clauses to be predicates. Van Elswyk (2020) argues that\nthis explains why that-clauses can compose with nouns, as in\n\u2018the belief that snow is white\u2019, as well as why\nthat-clauses can follow the adverb \u2018now\u2019, as in\n\u2018now that Giannis will be named MVP, Giannis will be offered a\nsupermax contract\u2019. In the first case, the that-clause\nspecifies the content of the attitude denoted by the noun phrase (e.g.\n\u2018the belief\u2019). In the second case, the use of\n\u2018now\u2019 contributes the information that the event \\(e_1\\)\ndescribed in the main clause occurs after the event \\(e_2\\) following\n\u2018now\u2019. The that-clause serves as a predicate that\nis satisfied by \\(e_2\\). Even rejecting the Relational Analysis, van\nElswyk finds a need for propositions as meanings of sentences and the\nthings designated by certain names (e.g. \u2018logicism\u2019),\nproposition descriptions, and propositional anaphors, such as\n\u2018so\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, and \u2018no\u2019.\n\nTrueman (2021) rejects the Relational Analysis in favor of a\nprenective view of attitude reports inspired by Prior (1971).\nWhereas the Relational Analysis treats the attitude verb \\(V\\) in\nascriptions of the form \u2018\\(S\\) \\(V\\)s that \\(p\\)\u2019 as\ncontributing a dyadic relation between \\(S\\) and the proposition\ndesignated by \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019, this view treats V as\nprenective, meaning that it acts as a predicate at one end and a\nsentential connective at the other. So, the prenective view denies\nthat \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 is a singular term, instead parsing our\nascription as \u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s that [\\(p\\)]\u2019, where\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is a sentence that expresses the proposition\ncontent of S\u2019s attitude. In denying that that-clauses\nare singular terms, Trueman avoids reifying propositions, and instead\nidentifies propositional contents as truth-conditions of sentences.\nThus, to believe the proposition that \\(p\\) is to stand in the\nbelieving relation to the truth-condition of \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019.\n\nOne might worry that the prenective parsing of belief reports clashes\nwith the syntactic data that motivated treating that-clauses\nas singular terms in the first place. After all, instead of\n\u2018Simon believes that Sharon is funny\u2019, we may say\n\u2018that Sharon is funny is what Simon believes\u2019, where the\ncomplementizer \u2018that\u2019 moves with \u2018Sharon is\nfunny\u2019 rather than staying put with \u2018believes\u2019.\nTrueman responds in two parts. First, the mere fact that\nthat-clauses are syntactic units does not imply anything\nsemantic about them\u2014viz., that they are singular terms.\n(Hofweber 2016 gives a sustained defense of this point.) Second, he\nmodifies the proposal from Prior\u2019s original parsing; rather than\n\u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s that [\\(p\\)]\u2019, attitude ascriptions are\nparsed as \u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s [\\(p\\)]\u2019. The complementizer\n\u2018that\u2019 is semantically vacuous, but functions to indicate\nthat \u2018Sharon is funny\u2019 is a complement of\n\u2018believes\u2019 rather than occurring as a standalone sentence.\n\n6. The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow?\n\nWe have suggested that the most promising arguments for propositions\nare the metalinguistic arguments and the Metaphysics 101 argument. The\nformer arguments are plainly theoretical: they appeal to the\nexplanatory power of semantical theories invoking propositions. To\nresist them, there is no need to explain away their intuitive appeal,\nbecause they do not and are not intended to have intuitive appeal.\nThis is not true of the Metaphysics 101 argument. It is thoroughly\nintuitive, and so resisting the argument requires giving a story about\nhow and why intuition goes wrong. In this section, we will consider\none general strategy for doing this.\n\nThe Metaphysics 101 argument can seem Janus-faced: its premises seem\nutterly shallow, and yet its conclusion seems to resolve a deep\nontological debate. One is apt to think, \u201cSure, what I believe\nis different from my believing it. And so we can distinguish the\ncontent of a belief from the attitude of belief. These contents are\npropositions. Fine, but now it seems there must be a domain of\nentities here, whose nature remains to be investigated. How could that\nbe?\u201d One might suspect some sort of equivocation or ambiguity is\nat work, some oscillation between a shallow and a deep\ninterpretation.\n6.1 The Internal/External Distinction \n\nRudolf Carnap\u2019s (1956) distinction between internal and external\nquestions may prove relevant here. For Carnap, an internal question is\na question that is asked within a particular linguistic framework.\nInternal questions are answered by invoking the rules of the framework\ntogether with logic and the empirical facts. Not all such questions\nare trivial, but questions about the existence of the sorts of\nentities definitive of the framework are. Carnap in fact thought that\nthe traditional metaphysician aimed to ask a framework independent\nquestion, an external question, failing to realize that external\nquestions are best seen as non-cognitive practical questions about\nwhich framework to adopt and at worst meaningless. (See the link to\nWeisberg 2000, in the Other Internet Resources section).\n\nRelying on Carnap\u2019s distinction, within certain linguistic\nframeworks, such as that presupposed by the Metaphysics 101 argument,\nit is almost trivial that there are propositions. All it takes is\nsomething as superficial as the Metaphysics 101 argument, or the\nfollowing even less enlightening argument, \u201cThe proposition that\nsnow is white is true; therefore, some proposition is true; therefore,\nthere are propositions.\u201d The traditional metaphysician, however,\naims to ask a non-trivial question about the reality of the\npropositions outside such frameworks. Such questions have no cognitive\ncontent.\n\nOne of the chief difficulties for Carnap is to explain the truth of\ninternal statements. If \u2018there are propositions\u2019 is true,\neven within a framework, what does its truth consist in? If truth in a\nframework is explained in terms of truth given the axioms of the\nframework, we will want to know about the truth-value of the\naxioms themselves. If they are true, what makes them true? If they are\nnot true, why can\u2019t we conclude that there really are no\npropositions?\n\nEven if we must reject Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction,\nperhaps some form of \u201cNeo-Carnapian\u201d ambiguity hypothesis\ncan help explain away the appeal of the Metaphysics 101 argument.\n\nA number of questions arise for the Neo-Carnapian. First, how are the\ninternal and external readings to be distinguished? Second, how\npervasive is the ambiguity? are there different readings not only for\nquantified sentences but for attitude- and truth-ascriptions as well?\nThird, what is the status of the Metaphysics 101 argument, given the\ntwo readings? The argument must be unsound when understood externally,\nbut must it be invalid, or is it a valid argument with a false\npremise? If so, which is false? Fourth, how could philosophers\nregularly miss the internal/external ambiguity?\n\nWe will briefly describe two Neo-Carnapian accounts.\n6.2 Fictionalism\n\nOne possibility is to explain the internal/external distinction by\nreference to fictions. Internal statements are statements made within\nor relative to a fiction, and they are to be assessed as true or false\nrelative to the fiction.\n\nHowever, any fictionalist interpretation of the internal/external\ndistinction would have to explain why the fiction of propositions,\nlike the fictions of properties and numbers, is not a mere game, but\ncan be used for describing reality. We will briefly discuss a kind of\nfictionalism designed to do just this: figuralism. (For\ndiscussion, see Yablo (2000, 2001), Yablo and Rayo (2001), Yablo and\nGallois (1998), and for a similar view, Balaguer 1998a and 1998b).\n\nRelying on pioneering work by Kendall Walton (1990), Yablo argues that\npretense can serve serious practical and theoretical purposes. To use\nWalton\u2019s example, by pretending that Italy is a boot, I can\neasily convey to you the location of the Italian town of Crotone. Here\nI am, in effect, using a pretense to convey information about the real\nworld. Literally, Italy is not a boot, but my interest is not in\nspeaking the literal truth, but in conveying a rather complicated fact\nto you as effectively as I can. Similarly, Yablo and Gallois claim,\none may pretend there are certain entities in order to better convey\ncertain facts (1998, 245\u20138). One might pretend there are\ndirections in order to facilitate communication of facts about which\nlines stand in which geometric relations to which other ones. Perhaps\none could do the same with propositions?\n\nHowever, Yablo (2001) emphasizes that the figuralist need not be\ncommitted to any psychological thesis about making-believe.\nWe may not consciously pretend that there are propositions when we say\nthat what we believe is true, just as we may not consciously pretend\nthat there are such things as stomach butterflies when we say we have\nbutterflies in our stomach. Figuralism requires only that there is a\nsemantical distinction between literal content and figurative content,\nand that by asserting sentences with certain false or at least highly\ndoubtful literal contents, we may also express genuine facts, which\nwould be well nigh impossible to express literally. (See Balaguer\n1998a and 1998b on the concept of representational aids)\n\nFiguralism makes it possible to diagnose the failure of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument as follows. If its steps are interpreted\nliterally, the argument is unsound but valid. If its steps are\ninterpreted figuratively, it is sound. Why are we fooled, then? One\npromising suggestion is that it can be very difficult to distinguish\nfigurative from literal content, particularly when the figures\nemployed have little presentational force.\n\nIf we accept this diagnosis, we are committed to thinking that every\nbelief-ascription is literally false. This is a bitter pill to\nswallow, though it may seem less bitter the less importance is placed\non literalness in communication (See Yablo 2001, p. 85).\n6.3 Two Readings for Quantifiers\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that ordinary English quantifiers are\nsusceptible to multiple readings, or different readings in different\ncontexts of use. Thus, Hilary Putnam (1987, 2004) has argued that\nthere is no single meaning associated with the vocabulary of\nquantification, and that, depending on context, an assertion of\n\u2018there are \\(F\\)s\u2019 might be true or false. For example,\nthe Polish mereologist, in certain contexts, might be able to speak\ntruly in asserting \u2018any objects compose a further object\u2019,\nwhereas an assertion of the negation of this sentence might true in\ndifferent contexts. (Note that Putnam is clear that the phenomenon he\nis describing isn\u2019t mere quantifier-restriction.)\n\nThe acknowledgement of different meanings for the quantifiers is not\nenough by itself to explain away the intuitiveness of the Metaphysics\n101 argument. As we mentioned earlier, what is needed is an account of\nthe apparent oscillation between a shallow and a deep interpretation.\nThere could, in principle, be a plurality of interpretations of the\nquantifiers even if none of the readings differed with respect to\nmetaphysical depth.\n\nRecently, Thomas Hofweber (2005, 2016) has claimed to have found the\nrequired pair of readings. A quantifier, he claims, may have either a\ndomain-conditions or inferential role reading. The\ndomain-conditions reading is just the familiar reading we know from\nfirst order semantics: \u2018there are \\(F\\)s\u2019 is true iff\nthere exists an entity in the relevant real domain which satisfies\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019. This reading is therefore ontologically\ncommitting and so deep (and thus external). The inferential\nreading, by contrast, brings with it no ontological commitment, and so\nis shallow (and thus internal).\n\nHofweber explains that the inferential role reading serves an\nimportant function. It enables us the easy expression of partial\ninformation. For example, I might not recall a name or unique\ndescription of Fred\u2019s favorite detective, but if I want express\nthe partial information I have, I can do this by saying \u201cFred\nadmires some detective.\u201d. Now, on the domain-conditions reading,\nwhat I express is false, and so I have misinformed my audience. What\nwe need, to achieve the desired end, is a reading for \u2018there is\nan \\(F\\)\u2019 which validates existential generalization, regardless\nof whether the names occurring in the premise refer to an entity. This\nis what the inferential role reading provides. Thus, we say\n\u201cFred admires some detective\u2014yes, it\u2019s Sherlock\nHolmes!\u201d\n\nHofweber points out that these two readings are not like the two\nreadings for \u2018bank\u2019. They validate many of the same\ninferences (e.g., \u2018there is an \\(F \\amp G\\), therefore, there is\nan \\(F\\) and there is a \\(G\\)\u2019) and, within discourses lacking\nempty singular terms, they validate all of the same inferences.\n\nNow for the relevance to the Metaphysics 101 argument. On either\nreading of the relevant quantifiers in the Metaphysics 101 argument\n(those in steps 1, 2, and 4), the argument is valid. But on the\ndomain-conditions reading, premise 1 (at least) is, if not false, then\nat least dubious\u2014a piece of controversial ontology. On the\ninferential-role reading, all the problems go away, and the argument\nappears completely shallow. The Janus-faced character of the argument\ncomes from oscillating between the two readings. Moreover, given the\nclose relations between the two readings, it is understandable that\nthe metaphysician fails to realize her mistake in thinking that the\nargument establishes the existence of propositions.\n\nFor an account like Hofweber\u2019s to succeed, it must be possible\nfor attitude- and truth-ascriptions to be true even if\nthat-clauses do not designate. For if they designate, then\nthe domain-conditions reading of \u2018there is something \\(S\\)\nbelieves\u2019 would be true.\n7. The Nature and Status of Propositions\n7.1 Easy Arguments: Mind-Independence and Abstractness\n\nReflection on the proposition role leads many propositionalists to\nrather dramatic answers to questions about the nature and status of\npropositions. Below is one standard line of argument, versions of\nwhich can be found in Bealer (1998) and Schiffer (2003). (See also\nCartwright (1962) and Soames (1999).)\n\nThe proposition that there are rocks, which we denote \\(\\ltb\\)there\nare rocks\\(\\gtb\\), does not entail the existence of any beings that\nhave or are capable of having mental states. It entails this neither\nin a strictly or broadly logical sense. That is, it is\npossible in the broadest sense for \\(\\ltb\\)there are\nrocks\\(\\gtb\\) to be true in the absence of all mental states. But now,\nif this proposition is possibly true in the absence of mental states,\nthen it possibly exists in the absence of all mental states, and so is\nmind-independent. This is an easy argument for the mind-independence\nof at least some propositions.\n\nA parallel \u201ceasy argument\u201d can be given for the\nabstractness of at least some propositions. \\(\\ltb 2+2=4\\gtb\\) does\nnot entail the existence of concrete entities. So it is possible for\nit to be true (and so to exist) in the absence of concrete entities.\nThus, it is possibly abstract. Assuming, contra Linksy and Zalta\n(1996), that abstractness is, necessarily, an essential feature of\nabstract entities, then it follows that \\(\\ltb 2+2=4\\gtb\\) is in fact\nabstract. One might want to extend such arguments to contingent\npropositions. Consider \\(\\ltb\\)there are trees\\(\\gtb\\). This\nproposition is false in a world without concrete entities. But if it\nis false in such a world, it must exist in that world, and so is\npossibly, and so actually abstract.\n\nSimilar arguments can be constructed for properties. If properties are\nwhat we assert of objects and what is true/false of\nobjects, then there are simple arguments for the conclusion that at\nmany properties are mind-independent and abstract.\n\nIt is dangerous to generalize these sorts of \u201cEasy\nArguments\u201d to all propositions (particularly singular\npropositions). But even if they cannot be fully generalized, they\nthreaten to show that propositions would be mind-independent abstract\nentities. Now, given that propositions de jure are sharable\nobjects of attitudes, it is antecedently unlikely that they should\nturn out to be, say, token utterances. But one might have thought that\npropositions could be identified with natural language sentence types\n(as in Quine 1960), or with sentence types in the language of thought.\nBut if the Easy Arguments succeed, it seems that to accept\npropositions, we must accept Platonism. Conceptualism about\npropositions seems ruled out.\n\nMany philosophers deny that there are propositions precisely because\nthey accept the validity of these Easy Arguments (and the truth of\ncertain attitude ascriptions). There are familiar problems besetting\nthe believer in abstract entities. The two \u201cBenacerraf\nproblems,\u201d in particular have received much attention in the\nliterature: the epistemological problem and identification problem.\nThe epistemological problem for abstract propositions, roughly, is\nthis: how can we know about abstract propositions, given that we\ncannot causally interact with them? The identification problem\nrequires a bit more explanation. If propositions are abstract, then\nthere will be many distinct candidates for propositions which seem to\nplay the proposition role equally well. If certain entities, the\n\\(F\\)s, are candidates for being propositions, why won\u2019t the\nentities consisting of an \\(F\\) paired with the number 1 count as\nadequate candidates as well, so long as we reconstrue predicates for\npropositions in such a way as to make the number 1 irrelevant? But\npropositions cannot be both \\(F\\)s and these new entities, because\nthese new entities are not \\(F\\)s. Is it simply indeterminate what\npropositions are? See the entry on\n platonism in metaphysics.\n (See also J. Moore 1999.)\n\nThe Easy Arguments can appear suspicious. How can the seemingly\nobvious acknowledgement that there are propositions\u2014i.e., that\nbeliefs have sharable objects which bear truth-values\u2014commit us\nto there being mind-independent abstract entities? We will discuss two\nsorts of reply found in the literature. Both are objections to the\ninference from there being propositions to the claim that\npropositions have the surprising features. We are putting aside\nobjections to the claim that there are propositions.\n7.2 Reply #1: Truth in a World vs. Truth at a World.\n\nThe Easy Arguments rely on an assumption about entailment and truth,\nnamely:\n\n(Assumption A)\nIf a proposition \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) fails to entail a proposition\n\\(\\ltb q\\gtb\\), then it is possible for \\(\\ltb\np\\gtb\\) to be true while not-\\(q\\).\n\n\nThis assumption is needed to reason from premises about propositions\nfailing to entail other propositions about there being mental states\nor being concrete entities to the possible truth of those propositions\nin the absence of mental states and concrete entities.\n\nBut how could (A) fail? If a proposition fails to entail that \\(q\\),\ndoesn\u2019t it follow that there is a possible world in which the\nformer is true and not-\\(q\\)?\n\nSome philosophers (Pollock 1985, King 2007) have argued that\nprinciples like (A) have two readings, one clearly acceptable but\nuseless to the Easy Arguments and the other useful to those arguments\nbut false. The two readings correspond to two ways of understanding\ntalk of truth with respect to possible worlds. One way for something\nto be true with respect to a world requires the truth-bearer to exist\nin the world and be true there. Another way is for the truth-bearer to\n\u201ccorrectly describe\u201d the world, where this does not\nrequire existing in the world. Pollock gives the example of a picture\ndepicting the non-existence of all pictures. The picture could\ncorrectly depict a situation even though the situation it depicts is\none in which the picture itself does not exist. Similarly, the\nMedieval philosopher Jean Buridan discusses the example of an\nutterance of \u2018there are no negative utterances\u2019. This\nutterance correctly describes a certain possible situation even though\nthat situation is one in which the utterance would not exist.\nFollowing Adams (1981), we may call the former way of being true with\nrespect to a world truth in a world and the latter truth\nat a world. The conceptualist may claim that propositions can be\ntrue at worlds without being true in them, by analogy with the\nexamples from Pollock and Buridan. A proposition like \\(\\ltb\\)there\nare no propositions\\(\\gtb\\) is true at certain possible worlds but\ntrue in none. Since we do not want to say that such propositions are\nnecessary, we must understand necessity as truth at every\npossible world. Correspondingly, to preserve the connections between\nentailment and necessity, we must understand entailment in terms of\nthe entailed proposition being true at every world at which the\nentailing proposition is true. Given all this, we can distinguish two\nreadings for Assumption A:\n\n(Reading 1)\nIf a proposition \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) fails to entail a proposition\n\\(\\ltb q\\gtb\\), then there is a possible world \\(W\\) such that \\(\\ltb\np\\gtb\\) is true in \\(W\\) and not-\\(q\\) at \\(W\\).\n\n\n(Reading 2)\nIf a proposition \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) fails to entail a proposition\n\\(\\ltb q\\gtb\\), then there is a possible world \\(W\\) such that \\(\\ltb\np\\gtb\\) is true at \\(W\\) and not-\\(q\\) at \\(W\\).\n\n\nGiven the understanding of entailment in terms of truth at a world,\nthe conceptualist will claim that Reading 1 is false, while Reading 2\nis true but useless to the Easy Arguments. Thus, the conclusions of\nthose arguments are blocked.\n\nThe plausibility of this response depends on having a good account of\nwhat truth at a world amounts to. But this, in turn, depends on issues\nin the metaphysics of modality.\n\nIf worlds are concrete particulars (\u201cI and all my\nsurroundings\u201d), as they are for David Lewis (1986), then we\ncould say that a proposition is true at a world if the\nproposition is about the entities that are parts of that world and is\ntrue, and true in a world if true at a world and also part of\nthat world. There may well be difficulties of explaining how a\nproposition could be part of more than one concrete world (and why it\nwould only be part of some concrete worlds but not all), but this\nframework seems to make conceptual room for the possibility\npropositions being true at worlds without being true in them.\n\nSuppose, however, that worlds were conceived as world stories, i.e.,\nas maximal consistent sets of propositions (see Section 2). How, then,\nmight truth at a world be understood? One approach, favored by Adams\n(1981), is to explain truth at a world in terms of truth in a world,\nunderstanding the latter to amount to truth were the world actual\n(were all its members true). On this approach, we would understand\nwhat is true at a world in terms of what is true in it, together with\ncertain facts about the actual world. However, the conceptualist\ncannot abide this approach. For, on this approach, the members of any\nworld are true in that world. But since the members of any and every\nworld are propositions, it would follow that, contrary to\nconceptualism, that it is necessary that there are propositions. A\nmore conceptualist-friendly approach is to reverse the order of\nexplanation, to explain truth in a world in terms of truth at a world\n+ existence in that world. How could truth at a world be understood? A\nnatural proposal is to understand it as membership in a world\nstory.\n\nDifficulties emerge with this proposal when we face the question of\nhow to understand consistency of world stories. There are maximal sets\nof propositions that are not possible worlds because they are not\nconsistent in the relevant sense. But the relevant sense is\nnot easily defined. Following Adams (1981), we might wish to use the\nconcept of possibility to gloss the notion of consistency: a set of\npropositions is consistent if and only if those propositions could all\nbe true together. This returns us to the problem noted in the previous\nparagraph: it again would turn out that necessarily there are\npropositions (even in mindless worlds).\n\nThe conceptualist might hope to take the relevant notion of\nconsistency as primitive and reject the gloss in terms of joint\npossible truth. Still, we should ask about the broader implications of\ndenying the joint possible truth of consistent world stories.\nConsider, for instance the notion of actuality. Only one of the many\npossible worlds is actual, although each is actual relative to itself.\nThe actual one, on the world story view, is the one all of whose\nmembers are true. But if this is what actuality for worlds amounts to,\nthen assuming possible worlds are possibly actual, it would follow\nthat for each possible world all its members could be true together.\nOught we to deny that possible worlds are possibly actual?\n\nThe conceptualist might hope to avoid these problems, without falling\nback on Lewis\u2019s concrete realism about possible worlds, by\nunderstanding worlds in terms of properties or states of affairs,\nrather than propositions. Following Stalnaker (1976), one might think\nof worlds as properties which are ways things could have been.\nFollowing Plantinga (1974) and others, one might think of worlds as\nmaximal consistent states of affairs, where these are thought of as\ndistinct from propositions.\n\nHowever, this retrenchment may end up only shifting the Platonist\nworries elsewhere. To distinguish the ways that are possible\nworlds (or possible world-states) from those which are not, it is\ndifficult to avoid appealing to a gloss in terms of being possibly\ninstantiated: the possible worlds are not only maximal but they could\nbe instantiated. Taking this line would require conceding that in\nevery world there are properties. Something similar holds for the\nconception of possible worlds as maximal consistent states of\naffairs.\n\nOne might think, however, that Platonism about properties is less\nproblematic than Platonism about propositions. The former do not\nrepresent the world, whereas the latter, as truth-bearers, do (Jubien\n2001, King 2007). However, properties can apply or fail to apply to\nobjects, and can be said to be true or false of objects, and so it is\nnot clear that worries about representation clearly gain more traction\nfor propositions than for properties. Similar considerations apply to\nstates of affairs.\n\nDespite these worries, the conceptualist might be encouraged by the\nexample of singular propositions. Hasn\u2019t the truth in vs. truth\nat distinction been useful in dealing with the modality of singular\npropositions? For example, consider any singular proposition about\nSocrates, e.g., the proposition that Socrates was a philosopher. Such\npropositions, plausibly, depend for their existence on the object they\nare directly about. One might therefore think that no singular\nproposition about Socrates could exist unless Socrates existed.\nConsider, then, the proposition that Socrates does not exist. It is\nclearly contingent that Socrates exists; things could have been\notherwise. But then the proposition that Socrates does not exist would\nappear to be possible without being possibly true. Unlike the examples\nfrom Pollock and Buridan, however, we cannot understand such\npossibility without possible truth in terms of expressing a possibly\ntrue proposition while not being possibly true itself. Propositions do\nnot express propositions, of course, and so we cannot understand their\npossibility without possible truth in this way (Plantinga 1981). What\nis it, then, for such a singular proposition to be possible but not\npossibly true? Answering this question was one of the key motivations\nin the development of the distinction between truth in and truth at a\nworld. But while Adams and others attempted to do this by thinking of\ntruth at a world as determined by what is true in that world together\nwith a certain set of facts about the actual world, the conceptualist\nhopes to kick aside the ladder of truth in a world altogether. Whether\nthis hope is reasonable or not is an important issue in contemporary\nwork on propositions. (Key recent discussions include King 2007,\nSoames 2010, and Merricks 2015).\n7.3 Reply #2: Deflationism to the Rescue?\n\nAnother response to the Easy Arguments is, so to speak, to deflate\ntheir significance by deflating propositions. The Easy Arguments\nsucceed, but their success marks no great philosophical discovery and\nraises no hard questions of the sort that have traditionally bothered\nmetaphysicians of a nominalist bent.\n\nWe will here discuss only Stephen Schiffer\u2019s (2003) theory of\n\u201cpleonastic\n propositions.\u201d[9]\n\nPropositions exist, for Schiffer, but unlike rocks or cats, there is\nnothing more to them than what our concept of a proposition\nguarantees. One may call them \u201cabstract entities,\u201d if one\nlikes, but this label should not encourage the thought that our minds\ncan reach beyond the physical world to make contact with denizens of a\nPlatonic universe. We know about propositions, not by interacting with\nthem, as we do with rocks and cats, but by being participants in\ncertain sorts of linguistic or conceptual practice. It\u2019s because\nwe speak or think in certain ways that we are able to know about\npropositions.\n\nSchiffer argues, in effect, that given our proposition-talk and\nthought, propositions are, in D. M. Armstrong\u2019s phrase, a kind\nof \u201contological free lunch.\u201d That is, the key\n\u201caxioms\u201d of our proposition-talk and thought are\nguaranteed to be true. These include the instances of the equivalence\nschema (E) for propositions: The proposition that \\(p\\) is true\niff \\(p\\). Given the truth of such axioms, it follows that\npropositions exist and have the features attributed to them by our\naxioms. Moreover, because these axioms are constitutive of the concept\nof a proposition, it follows that, by possessing that concept, we can\nknow the truth of these axioms.\n\nOne might concede to Schiffer that the axioms are constitutive of our\nconcept of a proposition. But why think those axioms are true?\nSchiffer stresses that we do not make the axioms true by saying,\nthinking, or \u201cstipulating\u201d that they are true. The\nmind-independence of propositions, after all, is implicit in those\naxioms.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s argument for pleonastic propositions is of a piece\nwith his argument for pleonastic entities generally, including\nfictional entities, events, and properties. A pleonastic entity, for\nhim, is an entity that falls under a pleonastic concept. The latter is\nthe key notion and is defined as follows.\n\nDefinition: A concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic iff it implies true\nsomething-from-nothing transformations. \n\nA SFN (something-from-nothing) transformation (about \\(F\\)s) is a\nstatement that allows us to deduce a statement about a kind of entity\nF, from a statement that involves no reference to \\(F\\)s. (61) SFN\ntransformations assert a kind of supervenience condition on\n\\(F\\)s: if the relevant non-\\(F\\) conditions obtain, \\(F\\)s exist and\nhave the relevant features. (E.g., if snow is white, then the\nproposition that snow is white exists and is true.)\n\nIf the concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic, then there are \\(F\\)s. We need to\nknow how to tell if a concept is pleonastic. Here is Schiffer\u2019s\ntest:\n\nTest: A concept \\(F\\) is pleonastic (and so implies true\nsomething-from-nothing transformations) iff adding it to any theory\nyields a conservative extension of that theory. (57)\n\n\nSchiffer\u2019s final formulation of the conservativeness test\nis:\n\nFor any theory \\(T\\) and sentence \\(S\\) expressible in \\(T\\), if the\ntheory obtained by adding to \\(T_{/{\\sim}F} \\ltb\\)the theory resulting\nfrom restricting quantifiers in \\(T\\) to \\({\\sim}F\\)s\\(\\gtb\\) the\nconcept of an \\(F\\), together with its something-from-nothing\n\\(F\\)-entailment claims, logically entails \\(S_{{\\sim}F}\\ltb\\)the\nsentence resulting from restricting quantifiers in \\(S\\) to\n\\({\\sim}F\\)s\\(\\gtb\\), then \\(T_{/{\\sim}F}\\) logically entails\n\\(S_{{\\sim}F}\\). (p. 57)\n\n\nOne might think the conservativeness test is overly complicated, and\nthat all that matters is that the new entities not interfere with the\nempirical world. If so, then the test would mention only empirical\ntheories not all theories. But, as Matti Eklund (2007) points out, two\nkinds of entity that are individually non-interfering with respect to\nthe empirical world might interfere with one another. Schiffer is\naware of this problem (see his discussion of anti-fictional entities,\npp. 55\u20136), and this is why he turns to the more complicated\naccount.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s picture is this. If a concept satisfies the\nconservativeness test, then its instantiation would be unproblematic\nbecause it would interfere with nothing else. Its instantiation comes\nfor free. If a concept doesn\u2019t meet this test, it doesn\u2019t\ncome for free.\n\nAlthough Schiffer\u2019s view of propositions can be described as\ndeflationary in one sense (because it attempts to deflate questions\nabout the existence and nature of propositions), the meta-ontology\nunderlying Schiffer\u2019s approach is, if anything, inflationary:\nall \u201cnon-interfering\u201d kinds of entity are\ninstantiated.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s, and other deflationist theories, must, at a minimum,\nanswer the following two questions, in addition to the questions\nfacing all propositionalists:\n\n(1)\nWhy would the non-interference of \\(F\\)s be evidence for their\nexistence?\n\n\nEven if \\(F\\)s would be non-interfering in Schiffer\u2019s sense, the\npostulation of \\(F\\)s logically conflicts with some consistent\ntheories, e.g., \u2018There are no \\(F\\)s\u2019. Schiffer places\nseverer constraints on the denial of entities than on the acceptance\nof them. Suppose \\(F\\)s would be non-interfering. Then adding them\nwould not add information about non-\\(F\\)s. But suppose also that\ndenying \\(F\\)s would not add information about non-\\(F\\)s. Why\nisn\u2019t this a reason to deny \\(F\\)s? So, in this sense, the\ntheory denying \\(F\\)s passes a corresponding conservativeness\ntest.\n\n(2)\nHow can the deflationist explain how these propositions have\ntruth-conditions?\n\n\nIf the proposition that snow is white is a simple, necessary and\neternal object, why does its having a property (truth) have anything\nto do with concrete snow\u2019s having a property (whiteness)? Do\ninstances of the T-schema simply state brute necessary connections\nbetween abstract objects and concrete ones? Or do these necessary\nconnections somehow derive from our practices, and if so, how?\n7.4 Reply #3: Propositions as Types\n\nAnother reaction one might have to the Easy Arguments is to accept\ntheir conclusions but to give an account of the nature of propositions\nwhich will make these conclusions palatable. One promising line of\nthinking, in this regard, is to think of propositions as types, the\ntokens of which are mental or linguistic acts or events, and in\nparticular the acts that would be thought to express the\nproposition. Such views have been developed in recent years by Dummett\n(1996), Hanks (2011, 2015), and Soames (2010, 2014a, 2015). We focus\nhere on the recent proposals put forth by Hanks and Soames.\n\nThe type view is motivated by its answers to otherwise puzzling\nfeatures of traditional Platonist views of propositions (e.g. Frege\n(1984)). On this view, belief and other attitudes are understood as\nrelations to already-existing propositions which represent things as\nbeing a certain way. The truth or falsity of an individual\u2019s\nbelief or other cognitive state is explained by the truth or falsity\nof the proposition which is the object of that state. If truth\nconsists in a representation\u2019s being accurate, then a\nproposition is true just in case it accurately represents things as\nbeing a certain way. Thus, on the traditional view, thinking subjects\nrepresent things as being a certain way (either in thought or\nlanguage) by standing in appropriate relations to propositions which\nfundamentally represent things as being a certain way.\n\nTwo problems arise for the Platonist\u2019s position. First, how do\ncognizers come to be acquainted with such propositions? Second, what\nexplains how propositions represent things as being a certain way?\nPlatonists appear to have no answer to the epistemic question, and\npresumably accept representation as a primitive feature of\npropositions. Type theorists, however, explain the relation between a\ncognizer and a proposition simply as an instance of the general\nrelation between type and token. Consider, as Dummett (1996, p. 259)\ndoes, one\u2019s humming of a tune. The tune is a species or type of\nmusical performance capable of having multiple performances at\ndiffering times or locations, while the humming of it is a token act\nbelonging to that type. One might then see the relation of a\nproposition to a mental or linguistic act as one between the type of\nact performed and the performance of the act.\n\nWhat type of acts should one identify with propositions? For both\nHanks and Soames, propositions are types of predicative acts.\nThe notion of predication here is simply, for atomic propositions, one\nof an agent\u2019s representing an object \\(o\\) as having property\n\\(F\\). (Hanks (2015, p. 64) characterizes predication as\ncategorization, or the sorting of things into groups\naccording to a rule. We will take this to be a form of\nrepresentation.) Since representation is primarily something done by\ncognitive agents, according to Hanks and Soames, one might wonder\nwhether the proposition itself is representational, and so possesses\ntruth-conditions, on the type view. Both theorists respond to this\nconcern by claiming that propositions are representational in a\nsecondary, derivative sense. There are many examples of types that\ninherit features of their tokens (a sonata (type) can be discordant in\nvirtue of performances of it being discordant; a movie can be\nfrightening in virtue of its tokens being so, etc. See the entry on\n types and tokens.)\n Just as an act can be described as intelligent in order to\ncommunicate that the agent acted intelligently in performing\nthe act, type theorists will claim that a proposition represents \\(o\\)\nas \\(F\\) in a similarly derivative sense wherein any agent who\nperforms the act of predicating \\(F\\) of \\(o\\) will thereby represent\n\\(o\\) as \\(F\\). One question that arises for such a view is whether\npropositions are genuinely representational entities with\ntruth-conditions, or whether the claim that a proposition represents\nthings as being a certain way is simply a convenient manner of\nspeaking indirectly about the actual and possible representational\nacts of thinkers.\n\nAs we have seen, the type view reverses the traditional order of\nexplanation concerning the nature of predication, representation, and\ntruth-conditions. On the traditional, Fregean picture, propositions\nexist as objective, mind-independent entities \u201cwaiting\u201d to\nbe entertained, judged or asserted, so to speak. On this view, for a\nsubject S to predicate \\(F\\) of \\(o\\) is for S to entertain the\nproposition that \\(o\\) is \\(F\\); for S to represent \\(o\\) as \\(F\\) in\nthought or language is to have have a thought or utterance with the\nprimarily representational proposition that o is F as its\ncontent, etc. On the type view, a proposition\u2019s representational\nand predicative properties are derived from the fundamentally\nrepresentational and predicative acts of agents.\n\nA concern for the type view is whether there will be \u201cmissing\npropositions\u201d\u2014truths or falsehoods which have never been\nentertained. One drawn to the type view may allow for the existence of\nuninstantiated types to account for the existence of these\npropositions. However, given that propositions are claimed to derive\ntheir representational features from their tokens, such uninstantiated\ntypes would lack representational features, and so lack\ntruth-conditions. Hanks suggests dealing with such propositions\ncounterfactually. Even if no one had ever predicated eloquence of\nClinton, the proposition that Clinton is eloquent is true iff Clinton\nis eloquent because if someone were to predicate eloquence of\nClinton, the token would be true iff Clinton is eloquent. Predicative\ntypes, then, inherit their representation features from both their\nactual and possible tokens. This response, however, leaves us with the\nquestion of truths for which there are not even any merely possible\ntokens\u2014for example, mathematical truths that are too complicated\nfor any finite mind to grasp. What, if anything, provides the\ntruth-conditions of these propositions?\n\nHanks (2015, p. 27) allows that propositions are mind-independent and\nobjective entities which do not depend for their existence on having\nany tokens, just as one might think about a difficult type of dive\nthat has never been performed. Thus, while Hanks\u2019 view appears\nto be a rejection of a traditional Platonism about propositions, it\nseems nevertheless to accept a Platonism about types by untethering\ntheir existence from their tokens. (Compare to Dodd\u2019s (2007)\ndefense of Platonism about types.) Soames (2014a,b) also allows for\nuntokened types, but only those whose constituents have been referred\nto or predicated in other propositions. For Soames, a proposition\n\\(p\\) may exist in \\(w\\) even if no token of \\(p\\) has been performed\nin \\(w\\). For Soames, if in \\(w\\) a predicative event has occurred in\nwhich an agent predicates \\(n\\)-place property \\(R\\) of \\(n\\) objects,\nand in \\(w\\) events of referring to or thinking of objects \\(o_1,\n\\ldots, o_n\\) have occurred, then the proposition that is the type of\nact of predicating \\(R\\) of \\(o_1, \\ldots, o_n\\) exists (even if \\(R\\)\nhas never been predicated of \\(o_1, \\ldots, o_n\\) in \\(w)\\). Still, it\nwould seem that there can be truths in a world about objects that have\nnever been thought of or referred to in that world. In response to\nthis, Soames claims that a proposition need not exist in a world \\(w\\)\nin order to be true in \\(w\\). In support of this, Soames appeals to\nother, albeit controversial, cases in which an object can have a\nproperty despite not existing. For instance, Socrates can have the\nproperties of being referred to or being admired\ndespite no longer existing. Thus, Soames\u2019 accommodation of our\nintuitions concerning propositions that have never been thought\nappears to involve a rejection of Actualism.\n\nThe type view has been argued to provide solutions to several\ntraditional problems for propositional thought, including\nFrege\u2019s puzzle, first-person belief, Kripke\u2019s puzzle about\nbelief, and the problem of empty names. In responding to these\nproblems, Soames invokes \u201cMillian modes of presentation,\u201d\nor ways of cognizing an object in thought which do not affect the\nrepresentational content of the act, to preserve a non-Fregean,\nMillian view of semantic content for names and natural kind terms\nwhile individuating propositions finely enough to solve traditional\nproblems in the philosophy of language. Hanks, by contrast, invokes\ndistinct types of referential and expressive acts as the constituents\nof propositions. On this view, each use of a name falls under several\ndifferent reference types which differ in their fineness of grain,\neach associated with a different proposition.\n\nAs we have seen, the type view is motivated in large part by the\nperceived need to explain how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way on the grounds that a view which accepts primitively\nrepresentational propositions is objectionably mysterious. Some\nquestion, however, whether the representational properties of\npropositions can (or need to) be explained at all (McGlone 2012,\nCaplan, et al. 2013, Merricks 2015). Merricks, for example, argues\nthat we should accept that there are fundamentally representational\nentities, but that we have no reason to favor mental states (such as\nbeliefs) over propositions as being the fundamental bearers of\nrepresentational properties. For if, e.g., beliefs are fundamentally\nrepresentational, then it is either a primitive fact about them that\nthey represent what they do, or it is a feature capable of\nexplanation. If it is a primitive fact about them, then the view\nappears just as mysterious as one which accepts that propositions are\nprimitively representational. If it is a fact capable of explanation,\nas the type theorists contend, then it is presumably explained in\nterms of an agent\u2019s ability to predicate properties of objects.\nBut unless there is some explanation of how an agent can engage in\npredication, predication must itself be a primitive representational\nability, and the theory has not made any genuine progress on what was\nto be explained.\n\nA final question worth considering at this stage is whether\npropositions are representational entities at all. Richard (2013) and\nSpeaks (2014), for instance, each develop views of propositions which\ndeny that they are. Consider the view defended by Richard. Sentences,\nbeliefs, and the like represent things as being a certain\nway\u2014snow as being white, for example. Put another way, the\nsentence \u2018Snow is white\u2019 represents snow\u2019s being\nwhite, where this is simply a way for things to be\u2014a state of\naffairs or property that is either instantiated or not (but does not\nrepresent things as being any way, just as properties are not in\ngeneral representational). On this approach, the proposition expressed\nby the sentence is identified with the way that things are represented\nas being, not as something which has representational properties\neither primitively or in need of explanation by more fundamental acts\nof predication. If an approach along these lines is correct, the type\nview appears to lose one of its central motivations.\n8. The Individuation of Propositions\n\nSome philosophers, notably W.V.O. Quine, recognize the existence of\ncertain sorts of abstract entities but not others at least partly on\nthe basis of concerns about identity conditions. Quine granted the\nexistence of sets, in part because they obey the extensionality axiom:\nsets are identical iff they have the same members. When it came to\nproperties, relations and propositions, however, he found no such\nclear criterion of identity. The property of being a creature with a\nheart, he noted, is distinct from the property of being a creature\nwith a kidney, even if all the same things exemplify the two\nproperties.\n\nIt is a controversial matter whether Quine was right to demand such\nrigorous criteria of identity as a condition for acceptance of a class\nof entities. However, even if Quine asks too much, any good theory of\npropositions ought to have something to say about when propositions\nare identical and when they are distinct. Developing theories which\ngive such accounts in a way that fits well with intuitive data\nconcerning propositional attitude ascriptions would enhance our\nreasons to accept propositions.\n\nThe question of identity conditions for propositions is importantly\nrelated to the question of whether propositions are structured\nentities. Propositions are structured if they have\nconstituents, in some broad sense, and the order of the\nconstituents matters. Order matters only if there could be two\nstructured propositions sharing all the same constituents, but which\nare distinct due to differences in the way under which those\nconstituents are \u201cunited\u201d in the proposition. E.g., if the\nproposition that \\(a\\) loves \\(b\\) is the ordered triple\n\\(\\ltb\\)loving, \\(a, b\\gtb\\), it is distinct from the\nproposition that \\(b\\) loves \\(a\\), which would be the ordered triple\n\\(\\ltb\\)loving, \\(b, a\\gtb\\).\n\nIf propositions are structured entities, then sameness of constituents\nand sameness of order will entail identity. There are, of course,\ndangers, in regarding propositions as structured. Prima facie, one\nwould rather not claim that the proposition that \\(x\\) is triangular\nis identical to the proposition that \\(x\\) is trilateral, since a\nsubject might believe one but not the other. It will be important,\nthen, not to individuate propositions too coarsely. However, one might\nworry, in the opposing direction, about overly fine individuations of\npropositions. Is the proposition that John loves Mary different from\nthe proposition that Mary is loved by John? For more on structured\npropositions, see the entry on\n structured propositions.[10]\n\nAny theory that construes propositions as structured entities would\nseem to face the problem of the unity of the proposition. It\nis not entirely straightforward to say what this problem or set of\nproblems is. But at the very least, there are at least two problems\nhere. There is the problem of explaining why one sort of structured\nwhole, a proposition, can be true or false, while the set of its\nconstituents is not. A list isn\u2019t true or false, and a\nproposition with the same constituents is; why is this? Second, there\nis a general problem of explaining how two distinct things could have\nall the same constituents. For a thorough discussion of the history of\nphilosophical work on the unity of the sentence and the proposition,\nthe reader should consult Gaskin (2008).\n\nSome hold that propositions lack constituents altogether, and so are\nunstructured. If propositions are unstructured, then if they are sets,\nthey inherit the identity conditions for sets: sameness of members.\nThus, if a proposition is the set of worlds in which it is true (as in\nStalnaker 1976), then \\(P=Q\\) iff \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have the same worlds\nas members iff \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true in the same worlds. As is\nwell-known, this theory leads to a very coarse individuation of\npropositions, too coarse, arguably, to handle propositional attitudes.\n(See Soames (1987) for a discussion of this theory as well as the\ntheory of propositions as sets of concrete situations or facts.\n\nIf propositions are unstructured and distinct from sets, there are\nseveral possibilities for explaining their identity conditions. First,\nidentity conditions might be specified in terms of possible attitudes.\nOne possibility is this: \\(P=Q\\) if, necessarily whoever believes\n(asserts, denies, etc.) \\(P\\) believes (asserts, denies, etc.) \\(Q\\),\nand vice versa. Second, proposition identity might be reduced to\nproperty identity in the manner of Myhill (1963) and Zalta (1983).\nThus, Zalta (1983, 72) offers the following definition of proposition\nidentity: \\(\\ltb p\\gtb =\\ltb q\\gtb\\) if and only if the property of\nbeing such that \\(p\\) is identical to the property of being such that\n\\(q\\). A third proposal, not incompatible with the second, is to\nexplain proposition identity in terms of the \u201cfree\ngeneration\u201d of propositions from a stock of certain\nnon-propositional entities, e.g., individuals, properties and\nrelations, by algebraic operations (Bealer 1982, Menzel 1986, Zalta\n1983 and\n 1989).[11]\n Although propositions on this approach are unstructured, each\nproposition may be represented by its \u201cconstruction\nsequence.\u201d To avoid identifying \\(\\ltb\\)Hesperus is\nbeautiful\\(\\gtb\\) with \\(\\ltb\\)Phosphorus is beautiful\\(\\gtb\\), the\nrelevant inputs cannot simply be Hesperus (Phosphorus) and the\nproperty of being beautiful. A well-known strategy to cope with this\nproblem, due to Frege, is to appeal to different modes of presentation\nassociated with the different names, each contributing something\ndifferent to the proposition expressed. However, these modes need not\nbe understood as complex properties uniquely exemplified by referent\nof the name. For instance, Bealer (1998) invokes what he calls\n\u201cnon-Platonic\u201d modes of presentation. Whether these\nnon-Platonic modes of presentation are understood as words, as causal\nchains of word use, or in some other way, the important point is that\nthe mode associated with \u2018Hesperus\u2019 will be different than\nthat associated with \u2018Phosphorus\u2019. Zalta (1989) introduces\npropositions with abstract constituents to do the work of these modes.\nOn Zalta\u2019s view, such singular propositions are built out of\nabstract individuals that encode the cognitive content of names. Since\nthese abstract individuals encode this cognitive content, there is no\nneed for the referent of the name to instantiate it, and a fortiori no\nneed for the content to be a property uniquely instantiated by this\nreferent. For more on encoding vs. instantiating, see section 6 of the\nentry on\n existence.\n Thus, these theorists hope to use the metaphysical tools of these\nalgebraic accounts to accommodate some of the key Fregean intuitions\nabout differences in propositions expressed while avoiding\ndifficulties with the Fregean doctrine of sense.\n\nFor a recent criticism of the notion of propositional constituency,\nsee Keller (2013); for a positive account of propositional\nconstituency, see Gilmore (2014).\n9. Propositions, Facts, and States of Affairs\n\nFrege famously wrote, \u201c\u2018Facts, facts, facts\u2019 cries\nthe scientist if he wants to bring home the necessity of a firm\nfoundation for science. What is a fact? A fact is a thought that is\ntrue.\u201d (1918, p. 25)\n\nIs a fact just a true proposition? There are metaphysical and\nlinguistic arguments to the contrary. Here is a standard metaphysical\nargument. The fact that snow is white couldn\u2019t exist if snow\nwasn\u2019t white, but the true proposition would (only it would be\nfalse). Therefore, the fact isn\u2019t the true proposition (See\nMoore 1953, p. 308). Facts might be, still, in some sense,\nderivative from true propositions, even if the identity claim fails.\nFollowing Moore (1953, pp. 261\u20132) and Slote (1974, p. 99), Kit\nFine (1982, pp. 52\u20133) suggests that facts may be conceived as\nconcretizations of true propositions. Thus, the fact that \\(p\\) is the\ntruth of \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\). However, so construing facts makes them poor\ncandidates for truthmakers: the truth of \\(p\\), presumably, is not\nwhat makes \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) true.\n\nOne well-known linguistic argument against identifying facts with true\npropositions is closely related to the Ambiguity Response to The\nSubstitution Problem, considered in Section 5.4. Substitution of\n\u2018the fact that \\(p\\)\u2019 for \u2018the true proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, or vice versa, produces peculiarities such as\n\u201cJohn believes the fact that Obama is president\u201d, or\nHarman\u2019s (2003) \u201cThe true proposition that fires are hot\nmakes it the case that fires are hot.\u201d If facts were true\npropositions, so it is argued, one would expect the substitutions to\npreserve truth.\n\nNonetheless, there are other uses of \u2018fact\u2019 that support\nthe identification:\n\nSnow is white. That\u2019s a fact. But it wouldn\u2019t have been a\nfact if snow were not white. So, some things that are facts might not\nhave been facts.\n\n\nUsed in this way, \u2018fact\u2019 seems to apply to entities that\nresemble propositions, in that they have two modes of being: existence\nand something akin to truth (e.g., obtaining) (see McGrath\n 2003).[12]\n\nOne option, in the face of apparently conflicting uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019, is to posit an ambiguity. (Fine 1982, p. 54) There\nare two kinds of entity associated with different uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019: one kind has one mode of being (it simply exists),\nthe other has having two modes of being (it may exist without\nobtaining). \u201cBipolar\u201d facts correspond, roughly, to what\nsome philosophers call possible states of affairs.\n\nHowever, some philosophers would want to distinguish even such bipolar\nfacts from propositions. Bipolar facts, the argument goes, are states\nof affairs, rather than true propositions. Clearly, not all\npropositions can be possible states of affairs, because there are\npropositions that are not possibly true, whereas possible states of\naffairs must obtain in at least some possible world. We might wish to\nextend the notion of a state of affairs to include impossible ones.\nWhether states of affairs, understood in this extended sense, are\npropositions clearly depends on the answers to questions about their\nidentity conditions. See the entry on\n states of affairs,\n as well as Richard (2013) for a recent view identifying propositions\nwith states of affairs.\n\nKing (1995, 2007, 2014) argues that all propositions are facts,\nalthough not the ones that we might expect. The proposition that Mary\nloves John is not the fact that Mary loves John but rather (to a first\napproximation) the following fact: Mary, loving, and John being the\nsemantic values of linguistic items standing in a certain syntactic\nrelation (represented by a phrase marker tree) which encodes\ninstantiation. King argues that his account has many virtues. It helps\nsolve the problem of the unity of the proposition (see the previous\nsection), insofar as the structure of a proposition derives from the\nsyntactic structure of a corresponding sentence. It requires\nrelatively minimal ontological commitments: if one accepts that there\nare languages with expressions designating objects and properties and\nin which certain syntactic relations encode instantiation, then one\nwill accept King-propositions. The account also provides for finely\nindividuated propositions: differences in syntactic structure of\nsentences will carry over to differences in the propositions\nexpressed. Given that the existence of King-propositions seems to\ndepend on their being language-users who use language in certain ways,\nKing is a conceptualist about propositions. (See section 7.2\nabove).\n10. Sparse and Abundant Conceptions of Propositions\n\nIn discussing the question of whether there are properties, D. M.\nArmstrong (1989) distinguishes sparse from abundant conceptions of\nproperties. Following standard terminology, let us say that when a\npredicate has a property as its semantic content, the predicate\nexpresses that property. (For simplicity, we will assume that\nsentences can have propositions as semantic contents.) Under an\nabundant conception of properties, whether a predicate expresses a\nproperty depends only on its broadly syntactic facts about it. The\nsimplest abundant conception holds that every well-formed predicate\nexpresses a property. According to sparse conceptions, not every\nsyntactically well-formed predicate expresses a property.\n\nA similar distinction may be applied to conceptions of propositions.\nAbundant conceptions will impose only broadly syntactic restrictions\non the expression of propositions. Sparse conceptions will deny that\nhaving the relevant syntactic properties is sufficient for the\nexpression and designation of propositions. Abundant conceptions of\npropositions face the threat of paradox. For more, see the discussion\non\n the Russell-Myhill Paradox\n in the entry on Alonzo Church.\n10.1 Expressivism and Moral Propositions\n\nOne motivation for accepting a sparse conception of propositions is\nexpressivism in metaethics. \u201cOld-fashioned\u201d expressivists\n(e.g., Ayer and Stevenson) claimed that moral sentences are\nnon-cognitive. We cannot believe that lying in politics is wrong, nor\ncan we have any broadly cognitive attitudes (e.g., disbelief) of the\nform \u2018\\(A\\)-ing that \\(p\\)\u2019 where \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019\ncontains moral terms. If we cannot have such attitudes, then\npresumably there are no moral propositions. (If there were such\npropositions, why wouldn\u2019t there be possible cognitive attitudes\nhaving them as contents?). And if there are no moral propositions,\nthen moral sentences do not express propositions, and so lack\ntruth-value.\n\nWe certainly talk and think as if we have moral beliefs, as if we\nbelieve moral propositions. For the old-fashioned expressivist, then,\nmany of our apparently sincere ordinary claims will have to be\nrejected. Endorsing such a sparse conception of propositions thus\nleads to the surprising consequence all moral sentences lack\ntruth-value.\n\nSome contemporary expressivists (Blackburn 1998, Horwich 1993, Stoljar\n1993) are less averse to moral propositions, moral properties and\nmoral facts. But they take these commitments as\n shallow.[13]\n They accept an abundant conception of propositions, properties, etc.,\nbut combine it with a generous dose of deflationism. There are moral\npropositions, but they are mere shadows of moral declarative\nsentences. (Even if they are shadows of our sentences in some sense,\nthey are not shadows in another sense, at least if the Easy Arguments\nfor mind-independence and abstractness are successful: what is\nmind-independent and abstract is, in a clear sense, not merely a\nshadow of sentences.)\n\nAt least three important questions can be asked about the combination\nof expressivism and deflationism about moral propositions. First, if\nthe expressivist accepts moral propositions, what is the difference\nbetween expressivism and realism? Second, by accepting deflationary\nmoral propositions, can the expressivist avoid the familiar problems\nfor moral realism (and cognitivism) which helped motivate expressivism\nin the first place? Third, can the realist avoid these familiar\nproblems equally well by accepting deflationary moral\npropositions?\n\nThe first question is examined in the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs non-cognitivism.\n We will briefly discuss the other two.\n\nConsider, for example, the Humean argument facing realism, a crude\nversion of which is as follows. If there are moral propositions, then\nmoral judgments are beliefs in moral propositions. But moral judgments\nare intrinsically motivational states, whereas beliefs are not. So,\nthere are no moral propositions. Of course, this argument may be\ncriticized as relying on an overly strong internalism, or a\nsimple-minded speculative psychology. But even when improved, it is\nnot immediately clear how accepting deflationism about moral\npropositions will help the expressivist solve the problem. The moral\npropositions exist, and so why can\u2019t they be believed\nindependently of having any intrinsically motivating states? How can\ntheir deflationary character help defuse this question? Moreover,\nsuppose that deflationism did help the expressivist cope with this\nproblem. Why couldn\u2019t the realist follow suit with her own\nappeal to deflationism?\n\nBlackburn\u2019s supervenience argument is a second argument against\nrealism. Blackburn formulated the argument in terms of moral\nproperties, as follows. If there are moral properties, then they\nsupervene on non-moral properties as a matter of conceptual necessity.\nThat is, in every conceptually possible world, if two things share all\nnon-moral properties, they share all moral properties. But if there\nare moral properties, the pattern of supervenience is not itself\nconceptually necessary. So, even if all \\(P\\)s are \\(M\\)s in fact,\nthere is some conceptually possible world in which there is a \\(P\\)\nwhich isn\u2019t an \\(M\\). Blackburn\u2019s question is this: if\nmoral properties can come apart from non-moral properties\nacross worlds, why can\u2019t they come apart from them\nwithin worlds? That is: what explains the \u201cban on mixed\nworlds\u201d? A similar problem can be formulated for truth as a\nfeature of moral propositions. What explains the ban on conceptually\npossible worlds in which one moral proposition \\(\\ltb x\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\)\nis true, while another moral proposition \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(M\\gtb\\) is\nfalse, but in which all relevant non-moral propositions \\(\\ltb x\\) is\n\\(P\\gtb\\) and \\(\\ltb y\\) is \\(P\\gtb\\) are alike in truth-value? What\nis not immediately clear is, first, how deflationary moral\npropositions will prove useful to the expressivist in answering this\nquestion, and second, how, supposing they do prove useful, why they\nwon\u2019t prove equally useful to the realist.\n\nWhat the expressivist seeks is a conception of propositions (and of\ntruths, facts, and beliefs) substantive enough to explain and validate\nour ordinary realist-seeming discourse but deflationary enough to\navoid the traditional problems for realism. Whether it is possible to\nnavigate the two is the subject of intense scrutiny in contemporary\nmetaethics.",
