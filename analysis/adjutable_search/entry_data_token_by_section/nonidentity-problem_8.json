    "main_text": "Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem || Act is wrong without making things worse for any existing or future person; impersonal wrongdoing\n3.2 Act is wrong without making things worse for any existing or future person; impersonal wrongdoing\n\nThis proposal accepts the standard nonidentity cases as\ncounterexamples to the person-based intuition. Thus, it rejects the\nperson-based intuition itself, that is, intuition (1); it has no need\nfor but doesn\u2019t necessarily reject the \u201cno harm\ndone\u201d test provided in intuition (2); and it accepts intuition\n(3), according to which the choices under scrutiny are indeed wrong.\nHaving rejected intuition (1), however, this proposal can then succeed\nonly if combined with a plausible account of just how an act\ncan be wrong even though it makes things worse for no existing or\nfuture person. Several such impersonal accounts have been\nproposed.\n3.2.1 Traditional utilitarianism\n\nTraditional forms of utilitarianism, including both the total form\n(\u201ctotalism\u201d) and the average form\n(\u201caveragism\u201d), have the resources to explain how an act\ncan be wrong while making things worse for no existing or future\nperson. If, by waiting a few years to have a child, the 14-year-girl\ncould have produced a child who is better off but nonidentical to the\nchild the girl in fact produced, both totalism and averagism will\nimply (other things being equal) that what the girl has done is wrong\n(Singer 2011, 107\u2013119). The key for both views is the position\nthat a world\u2019s value, and, indirectly, the permissibility of the\nchoice that brings about that world, is to be determined on an\naggregate basis: utilities correlating to the individual\nwellbeing levels for each person who does or will exist at a given\nworld are simply added up to determine the value of that world. On\nsuch an approach, it is immaterial whether we create additional\n(average or total) wellbeing (a) by creating additional wellbeing for\na particular existing or future person or (b) by bringing a\nnonidentical but better off person into existence. (See the entry on\n consequentialism.)\n\nThe nonidentity problem seems to show, as Parfit notes, that the moral\nprinciple we seek \u2013 the \u201cTheory X\u201d \u2013\n\u201cwill not take a person-affecting form\u201d (Parfit 1987,\n378). The obvious alternative is a theory that is impersonal at least\nin part. Both totalism and averagism fit that description. The\ndifficulty is that both views raise still other problems. Totalism can\neasily explain how an act that makes things worse for no existing or\nfuture person can be wrong. But it immediately generates\u2013 for\nexample \u2013 the repugnant conclusion (Parfit 1987,\n381\u201390; see also\n repugnant conclusion).\n Averagism does a good job with the nonidentity problem and the\nrepugnant conclusion but implausibly seems to prohibit bringing an\nadditional happier-than-average child into existence if it so happens\nthat prior generations have had especially wonderful lives (Parfit\n1987, 420; Feldman 1995, 192\u201393). It also generates problematic results when applied to the case Temkin calls \u201cHell Three\u201d (Temkin 2012, 319\u2013320). Surely, a situation that is hellish for everyone who exists is not improved by the addition of still more people whose lives aren\u2019t quite so hellish but still far less than worth living. Totalism and averagism, moreover, face objections based on\nconsiderations of justice, fairness and equality. Fashioning a cogent\nresponse to the nonidentity problem that does not create at least as\nmany problems as it solves has thus emerged as a critical challenge in\npopulation ethics.\n3.2.2 Impersonal pluralism; substitutional consequentialism; radical pluralism; critical level utilitarianism; sufficientarianism\n\nIn response to objections, some consequentialists have proposed that\nwhat makes a world better or an act permissible is determined by\nreference to the all things considered good, where the all\nthings considered good is a matter both of how much aggregate\nwellbeing a world contains and the extent to which that world realizes\nstill other ideals or values, including, for example, fairness,\ndesert, equality, human flourishing and the prioritization of the\nneeds of the least well-off (Temkin 1993, 221\u201327). An alternate\napproach retains additivity for the purpose of determining a world\u2019s\noverall value but also notes that we might understand what is to be\nadded up as indicated not by individual wellbeing levels but rather by\nthose levels adjusted in some way to reflect values beyond how well\noff a person is in a given world. See Broome 2015, Broome 1991 and\nFeldman 1997. Both sorts of approaches seem able to provide a\nplausible response to the nonidentity problem. But they also may have\nthe ability to avoid the repugnant conclusion \u2013 to explain, for\nexample, by reference to the ideal of human flourishing (Temkin) or\nthe concept of desert (Feldman) how it can be morally better to\nproduce a smaller number of extremely well off individuals rather than\na very large number of people whose lives are only barely worth\nliving.\n\nStill other philosophers have suggested principles that require agents\nto create additional wellbeing, including, when necessary, by bringing\na better off person into existence in place of a nonidentical less\nwell off person, but limit that obligation to the case where agents\ncan substitute in the better off person for the less well off\nperson on a one-to-one basis. Such principles aim to address the nonidentity\nproblem without giving rise to the repugnant conclusion. Holtug\n2009; Holtug 2010, 160\u2013162; see also Parfit 1987, 369\u201371\n(discussion of Principle Q); Peters 2004, 27\u201339 (concept of\ninjury by failure to substitute); and Savulescu 2001 (principle of\nprocreative beneficence).\n\nSome more radical forms of pluralism incorporate both person-based and\nimpersonal elements. The impersonal elements of such an approach may\nthemselves take either an aggregative or a substitutional form. Thus:\nconsider whether a couple ought to produce a third child, a child who\nwould be very happy if he or she were to exist but whose coming into\nexistence would create significant burdens for that child\u2019s two\nalready-existing siblings. Then, we might say that the goal of\nmaximizing wellbeing in the aggregate provides the couple\nwith a reason to have the third child while the person-based\ngoal of avoiding burdens on behalf of the two siblings provides the\ncouple with a reason not to have the third child. What the\ncouple ought to do is then determined by how these opposing reasons\nbalance against one another (McMahan 2006; 2009).\n\nIn contrast, Buchanan, et al., favor putting the person-based approach\ntogether with a substitutional form of pluralism. On their\nview, many of our obligations are person-based in nature, including\nthe obligation to avoid making a particular person worse off or\ncausing that person to suffer a \u201cserious loss of happiness or\ngood\u201d when the agent can do so without imposing\n\u201csubstantial burdens\u201d on others. This is their\n\u201cPrinciple M\u201d (Buchanan, et al. 2000, 226). In some cases,\nhowever, we have obligations that go beyond Principle M. It is here\nthat their impersonal \u201cPrinciple N\u201d is triggered,\nprohibiting agents from letting their dependents \u2013 including\ntheir children \u2013 \u201cexperience serious suffering or limited\nopportunity or serious loss of happiness or good\u201d if \u201cthey\ncan act \u2026 without affecting the number of persons who will\nexist and without imposing substantial burdens \u2026 on themselves\nor others \u2026\u201d (Buchanan, et al. 2000, 249).\n\nThe need to address not just the nonidentity problem but the full\nrange of population problems leads Temkin as well to recognize\nimpersonal as well as person-based values. Finding that terminology\nitself unenlightening, Temkin describes what he calls the internal\naspects view of when one world, or outcome, is morally better\nthan another as well as what he calls the essentially comparative\nview (Temkin 2012, 363\u2013456). We take for granted that our\nultimate goal is to evaluate a given world for its moral betterness\nagainst other worlds. But on the internal aspects view the good of\nthat one world as compared against a second world can be discerned\nwithout consideration of what is going on in still other\nworlds. Totalism is a paradigm instance of the internal aspects view\n(though not a view Temkin, given his emphasis on equality, human\nflourishing and other values, himself endorses). In contrast, on the\nessentially comparative view we cannot complete the evaluation of one\nworld against another in the absence of a potentially extensive\ninter-world comparison. Moreover, we find that when we engage in such\nan extensive comparison it is the person-based features of\nthose worlds that bear most clearly on our evaluation. Thus, suppose\nthat the only (potentially morally relevant) difference between two\nworlds is the addition to the second world of a single person whose\nexistence is worth having.  On the essentially comparative view, that\nsecond world may nonetheless turn out to be morally worse than the\nfirst, if that same person exists in a third world and there has a\nstill better existence (Temkin 2012, 364\u2013400).\n\nWith reference to Temkin, Parfit himself proposed a closer look at\nwhat he called the Wide Dual Person-Affecting Principle: \u201cOne of\ntwo outcomes would be in one way better if this outcome would together\nbenefit people more, and in another way better if this outcome would\nbenefit each person more.\u201d Parfit 2017, 154. According to\nParfit, \u201cthis Wide Principle would be only one of our\nbeliefs.\u201d Parfit 2017, 157. It is not, on its own, the\n\u201cTheory X\u201d Parfit urged us to seek decades ago. Parfit\n1987, 378. But it, like other forms of pluralism (radical or not),\nfaces an important challenge. Pluralistic theories have ample\nresources for generating what many philosophers will consider\nplausible accounts of (for example) both the nonidentity\nproblem and the repugnant conclusion. The problem is going to\nbe one of containment. The theories are too rich, and we don\u2019t\nyet know by what principle the particular view can be stopped from\ngenerating what we consider to be implausible accounts of the\nproblem cases as well. Indefinite and difficult to test, however, as\nsuch theories may be, they nonetheless offer an outline of an approach\nthat may have more promise than the alternatives for ultimately\nproviding a plausible analyses of the full range of population\nproblems.\n\nBoth a critical level form of utilitarianism (Broome 2014)\nand, alternatively, a sufficientarian approach (Huseby 2010)\nhave elements in common with pluralism yet may seem to balance values\nagainst one another in a more transparent way. Both views seem to\nprovide solutions to the nonidentity problem without generating the\nmost extreme forms of the repugnant conclusion. A difficulty for the\nformer view is that it generates the result that a world where many\npeople have lives below the critical level but still worth living is\nworse than a world where many people have lives far worse than a life\nworth living (Arrhenius calls this the \u201csadistic conclusion\u201d; see Arrhenius 2000). An obstacle for the latter position is\nthat it fails to explain why things are morally worse \u2013 and,\nindirectly why an act is wrong \u2013 in a case where the future\nperson who is the subject of our concern has a \u201cgood life\u201d\n(Huseby 2010, 205) but still seems clearly to be a victim of a prior\nact we consider clearly wrong. Consider, e.g., a child who has a good\nlife but who has been made to be blind as a result of an act\nperformed by the child\u2019s parents prior to conception. And\nsuppose that the parents themselves tethered their choice to produce a\nchild to their choice to produce a child they have blinded in that\nway; suppose that is, that the child would not have existed,\nor at least probably would not have existed, had the parents not\nperformed the act under scrutiny. We may well consider the act under\nscrutiny wrong. But a sufficientarian approach seems to block that\nresult.\n",
