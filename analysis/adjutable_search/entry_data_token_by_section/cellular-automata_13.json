    "main_text": "CA and Philosophy || CA and the Philosophy of Computation\n3.3 CA and the Philosophy of Computation \n\nCA are computational systems that perform complex tasks on the basis\nof the collective behavior of simple items. What, if anything, does it\ntell us about the importance of computation for systems in nature?\n\n\nDifferent conclusions have been drawn by practitioners in the field.\nSome have endorsed the more modest claim that the computational\nfeatures of CA are important to understand and compare social,\nbiological, and physical systems modeled by them; but others have\ntaken CA to support the view that computation and information\nprocessing in a discrete setting lie at the very foundations of\nreality. We will explore the stronger claim in\n Section 3.4\n below. As for the weaker claim, it is not possible here to address\nthe general importance of computational properties across the sciences\n(see Mitchell 2009: 169\u2013185). We will focus instead on a\nspecific, and controversial, principle put forward by Stephen Wolfram,\nthe so-called \u201cPrinciple of Computational\nEquivalence\u201d:\n\n\nThere are various ways to state the Principle of Computational\nEquivalence, but probably the most general is just to say that almost\nall processes that are not obviously simple can be viewed as\ncomputations of equivalent sophistication. (Wolfram 2002:\n716\u2013717)\n\n\nThe Principle is the most fundamental law of Wolfram\u2019s New\nKind of Science, as well as a prominent regularity featured by\n (NKS2):\n \u201cits implications are broad and deep, addressing a host of\nlongstanding issues not only in science, but also in mathematics,\nphilosophy and elsewhere\u201d (Wolfram 2002: 715). Contrary to\nWolfram\u2019s claims, the Principle may not be new to philosophy at\nall. That \u201call processes can be viewed as computations\u201d\n(Wolfram 2002: 715) has often been argued for in the history of\nphilosophy, just as the claim that universal computation is a\nwidespread phenomenon in the natural world (see, e.g., Searle 1992;\nPutnam 1988 and the entry on\n computation in physical systems).\n However, Wolfram\u2019s explanation of the Principle includes two\nfurther, and more specific, statements: i) No natural system\ncan compute more things than a universal digital computer (see Wolfram\n2002: 730), that is, \u201cuniversal computation is an upper limit on\nthe complexity of computation\u201d (Mitchell 2009: 157); and\nii) The computations performed by natural systems are\nessentially equivalent in sophistication (see Wolfram 2002:\n719\u2013726).\n\nThe first point is relevant once we compare digital computation with\nthe idea of a computer working with real numbers in continuous time.\nIt has been proved (see C. Moore 1996) that such a device would be\nable to compute more functions than a traditional Turing machine.\nHowever, proponents of a discrete space-time like Wolfram treat\ncontinuous processes as, in a sense, epiphenomenal, since they already\nhave independent reasons (some of which will be addressed\n below)\n to believe in a fundamentally discrete universe. As for the second\npoint, its main problem is that the interpretation of\n\u201cequivalent sophistication\u201d is not straightforward. For\neven assuming that universal computation is widespread, it does not\nseem to follow that all computation is equivalent in sophistication.\nComplexity scientists, even after having agreed with Wolfram on the\nimportance of computation for social, biological and physical systems,\nand even on the extent to which universal computation is supported in\nnature, are puzzled by his claim:\n\n\nI find it plausible that my brain can support universal computation\n(\u2026) and that the brain of the worm C. elegans is also\n(approximately) universal, but I don\u2019t buy the idea that the\nactual computations we engage in, respectively, are equivalent in\nsophistication. (Mitchell 2009: 158)\n\n\n\nIt is not clear what to make of computational equivalence. Yes, there\nis a threshold in which systems are related to one another, but given\nthe difficulty of moving among them, is this any more useful than\nsaying that skateboards and Ferraris are equivalent means of moving\nabout? (Miller & Page 2007: 232)\n\n\nMiller and Page argue that, for all scientific purposes,\n\u201crepresentations do matter, and what can be easily computed in\none system is often difficult (but still possible) to compute in\nanother\u201d. Even if Wolfram is right when he claims that a simple\nautomaton can calculate the first few prime numbers (Wolfram 2002:\n640), the calculation we have to do to encode the input and decode the\noutput is very complex: \n\n\nThis latter calculation could be much more \u201cdifficult\u201d to\ncompute than the original problem, just as the complexity of a\ncompiler can far exceed the complexity of the programs it produces.\n(Miller & Page 2007: 232)\n\n\nTaking these objections ever further, the crucial consideration is\nthat any system with a large enough state space could be shown to be\n(in Wolfram sense) equivalent to \u201cintelligent systems\u201d.\nFar from supporting some form of universality, Aaronson argues that\nthis type of \u201cequivalence\u201d stems from a misunderstanding\nof the role of computational reductions: \n\n\nSuppose we want to claim, for example, that a computation that plays\nchess is \u201cequivalent\u201d to some other computation that\nsimulates a waterfall. Then our claim is only non-vacuous if\nit\u2019s possible to exhibit the equivalence (i.e., give the\nreductions) within a model of computation that isn\u2019t itself\npowerful enough to solve the chess or waterfall problems. (2011:\n285\u2013286)\n\n\nIn other words, unless it can be proved that the encoding/decoding\nfunctions are not doing all the heavy lifting (and just use a\nsecondary system, a waterfall or a CA, to vacuously transmit\ninformation), it is hard to consider the alleged\n\u201cequivalence\u201d meaningful at all: \u201cwe are merely\ntrading an infeasible search among programs for an infeasible search\namong input encoding schemes\u201d (Aaronson 2002: 413). Moreover, a\nrationale for studying CA (Ilachinski 2001: 8) is that their\nimplementation can be massively optimized for specific problems with\nsignificant performance gain on standard computers (see for example\nZaheer et al. 2016). Unless Wolfram\u2019s notion of\n\u201cequivalent sophistication\u201d simply means \u201cthey\ncompute the same functions\u201d\u2014in which case, the claim is a\ntruism\u2014, the Principle cannot explain this empirical difference.\nThe Principle may have a more substantive reading if understood as a\nmetaphysical thesis about the universe in general, not as a scientific\ngeneralization having merely heuristic value. Under this stronger\nreading, the Principle is no more concerned with particular systems\nthat can be fruitfully analyzed via computation theory, but with the\nfact that (different epistemological properties notwithstanding) the\nworld itself is a computer. In a sense, any system would just be the\nemergent manifestation of a unique, underlying computational reality.\nWhich naturally leads us to finally address the boldest question: What\nif the universe itself was a CA? \n",
