    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Theology\n3.5 Theology\n\nAlthough explication of the nature of God is absent in the surviving\nfragments of Israeli\u2019s philosophical corpus, it is apparent that\nIsraeli, like the Muslim philosopher al-Kindi before him, combined the\nNeoplatonist notion of God as the source of emanation of all things,\nwith the idea common to the monotheistic religions, of a willful\nCreator who created the world in time. In blending these two\nconceptions, these philosophers rejected the Aristotelian conception\nof the eternity of the world, as well as the idea of eternal emanation\nof some of the Greek Neoplatonists. Israeli\u2019s use of the Arabic\nterm, al-Bari, \u201cthe Creator\u201d reflects the\nreligious sensitivities of his age\u2014and is not simply a\ntranslation of Plotinus\u2019 \u201cThe One\u201d.\n\nIn Plotinus\u2019 Enneads, the founding text of Neoplatonist\nphilosophy, The One contains a will which is not separate\nfrom itself (Enneads, vi 8.21), and precedes the emanation of\nNous (The Intellect/Intelligence) a secondary entity from\nwhich all lower beings emanate. In Arabic paraphrases of Plotinus, the\nWill or Word of God is a secondary hypostasis which\ncreates Intellect (cAql). This model is also seen\nin later Jewish Neoplatonist philosophers Solomon Ibn Gabirol and\nJudah Halevi. However, Isaac Israeli, like Plotinus, does not treat\nthe will of God as a separate hypostasis or secondary being.\n\nOne prominent feature in most variants of Neoplatonist thought is\nNegative Theology, the idea that one cannot predicate anything of God.\nThe problems which this approach intended to avoid were two undesired\nimplications arising from predication of a quality of\nGod\u2014namely, that if we attribute a particular quality to God,\nthis quality exists co-extensively with God, and must hence be\nco-eternal; secondly, it introduces multiplicity to God. The\nNeoplatonists, in the main, wished to conceive of God as a simple and\nradical unity, preceding all multiplicity in the world, and as such,\nmust precede the existence of qualities. Hence the only two allowable\npredications of God are God\u2019s Unity and God\u2019s Existence.\nIn none of the surviving materials do we find Israeli expressing\nNegative Theology explicitly. Israeli\u2019s pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim\npromotes negative theology in his commentary on the mystical work\nSefer Yetzirah, which lead scholars Altmann and Stern\n(Isaac Israeli, pp. 157\u20138) to conclude that we can\nsafely assume that Israeli held this opinion as well.\n",
