    "main_text": "Maimon\u2019s Influence on the Formation of German Idealism\n8. Jewish Philosophy and Culture\n\nBeing raised in an East-European Jewish surrounding, Maimon\u2019s\nthought was influenced by the major intellectual movements of this\narena. Talmud, Kabbalah, contemporary Hassidism and\nmedieval Jewish philosophy played a crucial role in the formation of\nMaimon\u2019s philosophy as well as the style of his writings. The\nstrongest influence was that of Maimonides, whose unbiased and strict\nrationalism Maimon took as a guiding example throughout his life (even\nwhen he no longer adhered to Maimonidean metaphysics). Following\nMaimonides, Maimon held intellectual perfection as the ultimate human\nend, and saw moral perfection merely as means for achieving this end.\nLike Maimonides, Maimon argued that God\u2019s image in humanity is\nthe intellect and that to the extent that we activate and develop our\nintellectual capacities we become closer and more similar to God.\n\nMaimon\u2019s relation to the Kabbalah was a bit more\nambivalent. While he had no sympathy for the anthropomorphic teachings\nof some of the major Kabbalistic works, Maimon attempted to disclose\nthe rationalistic core of the Kabbalah, which he identified\nwith Spinoza\u2019s pantheistic teachings. In his early Hebrew\nwritings Maimon develops the view that God is also the material\ncause of the world (i.e., that all things are merely predicates\nof God, who is their substratum). Since Maimon conceives God to be a\npure intellect, the result is a genuine form of radical \u2014 and\npantheistic \u2014 idealism. This form of idealism plays a\nsignificant role in Maimon\u2019s thought in the 1790s, and possibly\nalso in the development of German Idealism in general.\n\nMaimon also seems to borrow from Kabbalistic and contemporary Hassidic\nwritings the idea of an infinite process through which one\n\u201cstrives to turn matter into form,\u201d though he will\ninterpret this formula in metaphysical rather than ethical terms.\n\nIn his early Hebrew writings Maimon expresses a deep interest and\ncuriosity about astrology and magic, an interest that he returns to as\na contributor and editor of the Magazin zur\nErfahrungsseelenkunde.\n\nAfter his migration from Lithuania to Germany, Maimon entered the\ncircles of the Haskala (the Jewish Enlightenment movement) in\nBerlin. Maimon shared with this circle the idea that there is a need\nto propagate the enlightenment and scientific education among\ntraditional Jews; yet, he seemed to have a very different\nunderstanding of what Enlightenment is. While for the Berlin\nHaskala, \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 was primarily the\nattempt to acculturate the Jewish masses in order to allow their\nacceptance into modern German society, Maimon\u2019s idea of\nEnlightenment was that of propagating science and philosophy. This\nunderstanding of Enlightenment was deeply imbedded in Maimon\u2019s\ninheritance of Maimonidean philosophy, which took philosophy and the\nsciences to be the highest stages of religious work, through which one\ncomes to know God in the deepest sense. This attitude is clearly\ndemonstrated in Maimon\u2019s 1791 commentary on the Guide of the\nPerplexed \u2014 Giva\u2019ath ha-Moreh (Hebrew: The\nHill of the Guide). In this work Maimon frequently interprets the\nclaims of Maimonides according to 18th century science and philosophy\n(especially Kant). While this form of intentional anachronism reveals\nMaimon\u2019s view of philosophy as a perennial discourse, it was\nalso designed to serve the propagation of modern science and thought\namong its readers (Maimon himself explains in a similar way\nMaimonides\u2019 decision to open his legal codex, the Mishne\nTorah, with a summary of Aristotelian first philosophy).\n\nLike other members of the Jewish enlightenment, Maimon criticized\ntraditional Jewish society, and primarily the Talmudists, for their\nprejudices and idleness. Yet, along with this straightforward\ncriticism, Maimon also expressed a deep appreciation for the\nsharpness, devotion and moral character of the Talmudists. In his\nAutobiography, Maimon writes that he \u201cwould have to\nwrite a book, had I wished to answer all the unjust charges and\nridicule brought against the Talmud by both Christian authors as well\nas wishing-to-be-enlightened Jews.\u201d (GW I 172 | LB I 172). Here\nMaimon gives a detailed picture of various streams and aspects of the\nJewish culture. In most cases his account is a masterpiece of a\nthoughtful, thoroughly informed, and unbiased exploration of\none\u2019s own culture.\n\nMaimon\u2019s reception by both traditional and enlightened Jews was\nquite poor. In a few texts Maimon was lumped together with Spinoza and\nAcosta to form \u201cthe great chain of Jewish heretics,\u201d but\nmostly Maimon\u2019s writings and philosophy were ignored. The\ntraditional community could not forgive him his infidelity and his\ndesertion of their ranks (A certain literary source tells us that in\nMaimon\u2019s funeral the children of the nearby Jewish community of\nGlogau ran after his coffin and threw stones on it. Maimon\u2019s\ncorpse was buried at the margin of the Jewish cemetery in Glogau. When\nMaimon\u2019s friend, Graf Kalkreuth, asked why he was treated with\nsuch disrespect, he was told that \u201cthe edge of the cemetery is\nan honorary place designated traditionally for philosophers and their\nlike\u201d). For the enlightened Jews of Germany, Maimon was too much\nof an Ostjude and had too much sympathy for and similarity to\nthe Talmudists. Furthermore, Maimon never took part in the attempt to\ndefine the \u201cessence\u201d of Judaism and by this to provide a\ntheology that would imitate and be able to compete with modern\nProtestant theology. Being thoroughly knowledgeable about the variety\nof aspects and streams of Judaism, Maimon simply could not\nparticipate in this reductive project which unfortunately was quite\ncentral to modern Jewish philosophy. Thus, in spite of the fact that\nMaimon\u2019s erudition in Jewish literature was hardly equaled by\nany other modern Jewish thinker, Maimon\u2019s name is\nomitted in many, if not most, 20th century surveys of\nmodern Jewish philosophy.\n",
