    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Instrumentalist?\n2.2 Instrumentalist?\n\nBy portraying it as a tool for helping a user get by in an uncertain\nworld, QBism has been characterized as merely a form of\ninstrumentalism about quantum theory. But this is no reason to reject\nthe view absent arguments against such instrumentalism.\n\nInstrumentalism is usually contrasted with realism as a view of\nscience (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n The contrast is often taken to depend on opposing views of the\ncontent, aims, and epistemic reach of scientific theories. Crudely,\nthe realist takes theoretical statements to be either true or false of\nthe world, science to aim at theories that truly describe the world,\nand theories of mature science to have given us increasingly reliable\nand accurate knowledge even of things we can\u2019t observe: While\nthe instrumentalist takes theoretical statements to be neither true\nnor false of the world, science to aim only at theories that\naccommodate and predict our observations, and theories even in mature\nscience to have given us increasingly reliable and accurate\npredictions only of things we can observe.\n\nQBism offers a more nuanced view, both of quantum theory as a theory\nand of science in general. Fuchs (2017a) adopted the slogan\n\u201cparticipatory realism\u201d for the view of science he takes\nto emerge from QBism (if not also a variety of more or less related\nviews of quantum theory). For QBism a quantum state assignment is true\nor false relative to the epistemic state of the agent assigning it,\ninsofar as it corresponds to that agent\u2019s partial beliefs\nconcerning his or her future experiences (beliefs the agent should\nhave adopted in accordance with the Born Rule). But what makes this\nquantum state assignment true or false is not the physical world\nindependent of the agent.\n\nThe QBist does not take quantum theory truly to describe the world:\nbut (s)he does take that to be the aim of science\u2014an\naim to which quantum theory contributes only indirectly. For\nexample, the Born Rule in the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\).\n\n\nis less agent-specific than any probability assignments themselves.\nIt\u2019s a rule that any agent should pick up and use\u2026. it\nlives at the level of the impersonal. And because of that, the Born\nRule correlates with something that one might want to call real.\n(Fuchs 2017: 119)\n\n\nFuchs thinks one thing quantum theory has taught us about the world is\nthat it is much richer than we may have thought: as agents using\nquantum theory to make wise decisions we are not just placing bets on\nan unknown but timelessly existing future but actively\ncreating that future reality: \u201creality is more than any\nthird-person perspective can capture\u201d. That is the sense in\nwhich he takes QBism to support a strong participatory realism, about\nthe world in and on which we act and about how science should describe\nit.\n\nBy contrast, Mermin 2019 draws related but possibly less radical\nconclusions about science that (perhaps contrary to his intentions)\nsome might interpret as a kind of instrumentalism or even\nphenomenalism:\n\n\n\u2026science in general, and quantum mechanics in particular, is a\ntool that each of us uses to organize and make sense of\nour own private experience. p.2\n\nThe fact is that my science has a subject (me) as well as an object\n(my world). Your science has a subject (you) as well as an object\n(your world). ... While each of us constructs a different world, the\nworld of science is our joint construction of the vast body of\nphenomena that we try to infer, through language, to be common to our\nown individual worlds. Science arises out of our use of language to\nindicate to each other our individual experiences out of which we each\nconstruct our own individual worlds. p.5\n\n",
