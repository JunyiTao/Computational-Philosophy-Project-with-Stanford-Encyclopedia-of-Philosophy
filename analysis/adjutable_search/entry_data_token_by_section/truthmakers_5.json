    "main_text": "What is a Truth-maker? || Truth-Making as Grounding\n1.6 Truth-Making as Grounding\n\nMany recent approaches define truth-making in terms of\ngrounding or what is sometimes described as non-causal\nmetaphysical dependence. The notion of truth-making is typically\nintroduced, as we have seen, in terms of the ideology of \u201cin\nvirtue of\u201d. As we have also seen, many philosophers then ask:\nbut what independent content can be given to this notion? In response\nto this challenge, a theory of grounding may be conceived as a general\ntheory of \u201cin virtue of\u201d in terms of which truth-making\nmay then be explained. A further consideration which motivates those\nalready committed to grounding is the general methodological principle\nthat favours theoretical unification. Their idea is that by conceiving\nof truth-making as a kind of grounding, we are able to understand\ntruth-making better, i.e. not as an isolated phenomenon but as an\ninstance of a more general pattern, thereby illuminating not only the\nnature of truth-making but grounding too. \n\nEarly exponents of grounding within analytic philosophy date from the\n1960s (Bergmann 1961: 229, Hochberg 1967: 416\u20137). Recently,\ngrounding has been explained in a variety of different ways (Correia\nand Schnieder 2012, Raven 2015). But, broadly speaking, we can\ndistinguish between two conceptions which assign different logical\nforms to grounding statements: (1) the \u201cpredicate\u201d or\n\u201crelational\u201d view whereby grounding statements are\nassigned the logical form \u201cx grounds y\u201d\nwhere \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d mark singular\nterm positions and the verb expresses a relation; (2) the\n\u201coperator\u201d view whereby the canonical form of a grounding\nstatement is characterised by a sentence operator. So statements about\nsomething grounding something else have the logical form\n\u201cp because q\u201d where \u201cp\u201d\nand \u201cq\u201d mark positions for sentences. The predicate\nview of grounding is held by, amongst others, Schaffer 2009, Audi\n2012, Raven 2012; the operator view is advanced by Fine 2001, 2012,\nSchnieder 2006a, Correia 2011 [2014]. (A third approach, owed to Mulligan\n2007, recognises a plurality of different forms of grounding\nstatements.) The choice between (1) and (2) is often made either on\nthe basis of an assessment of the logical form of typical grounding\nclaims, or on the basis of ontological commitment, for example, the\nclaim that the operator approach to grounding is \u201contologically\nneutral\u201d because (allegedly) operators don\u2019t stand for\nanything as (allegedly) predicates do (Correia 2010: 254, Fine 2012:\n47).\n\nWe can now distinguish two broad conceptions of truth-making, defined,\nrespectively, in terms of the operator and predicate approach to\ngrounding.\n\n(Grounding-Predicate-T)\nA truth-maker is an entity x which makes a proposition\ny true iff the fact that x exists grounds the fact\nthat y is true. \n(Grounding-Operator-T)\n A truth-maker is an entity x which makes a proposition\ny true iff y is true because x exists.\n\n\n\nFor the former, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005, Schaffer 2009, Jago 2018:\n184\u2013202, for the latter, Correia 2005 (sec. 3.2), 2011 [2014],\nSchnieder 2006a, Mulligan 2007, Caputo 2007. \n\nOne attraction of conceiving truth-making as based on grounding, aside\nfrom the more general methodological virtues of theoretical\nunification mentioned above, arises from taking grounding to be\n\u201chyperintensional\u201d nature. Grounding is intended to be a\nnotion that\u2019s fine-grained enough to distinguish those entities,\ne.g., the cardinal numbers, that ground a necessary truth, such as\n2+2=4, from those that don\u2019t, e.g. a contingent existent such as\nthe aforementioned ice floe. Because grounding is so fine-grained\nneither Grounding-Predicate-T or\nGrounding-Operator-T will give rise to the over-generation\nthat beset Entailment-T and Necessitation-T but\nwithout having to appeal, like Projection-T, to an\nunderdeveloped notion of \u201cabout \u201d or\n\u201crelevance\u201d. \n\nOf course, in light of sec, 1.2 and 1.4 above, we can foresee a\ndownside to this. Both Grounding-Predicate-T and\nGrounding-Operator-T quantify over propositions that stand\nhyperintensionally to their truth-makers. It follows that both\nGrounding-Predicate-T and Grounding-Operator-T share\na commitment with Necessitarian-T and\nEssentialist-T, viz. an ontology of abstract propositions\nwhich have their meanings essentially. But, again, this may be a\ncommitment many grounding theorists have already made or be willing to\naccept if it gives them a good account of truth-making. Another issue\nis that there is no consensus upon the formal properties of grounding.\nWhilst, for example, Schaffer (2009: 376) has maintained that\ngrounding is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive, Rodriguez-Pereyra\n(2015) has argued that the relation of truth-making isn\u2019t any of\nthese things. But Rodriguez-Pereyra also argues that grounding\nisn\u2019t any of those things either. \n\nSo far we have considered efforts to define truth-making in terms of\ngrounding. But there are other approaches in the literature which seek\nto endorse one notion at the expense of the other. One way accepts\ngrounding as a welcome theoretical innovation but argues that we are\nbetter off without truth-making, at least in the forms which have\nbecome familiar to us. A second way continues to endorse truth-making\nwhilst rejecting grounding. \n\nThe first approach, taken by Fine, involves embracing grounding but\nrejecting truth-making. It\u2019s truth-making, he argues, we can do\nwithout; grounding does a better job (Fine 2012; 43\u20136). Here\ntruth-making is conceived as a relation between a worldly entity and a\nrepresentation: the existence of the entity guarantees the truth of\nthe representation. But, Fine argues, it is more theoretically\nfruitful to take grounding as the central notion for metaphysics. This\nis partly because, Fine maintains, grounding is a less restrictive\nnotion than truth-making, because grounding does not require that the\nultimate source of what is true should lie in what exists, rather we\ncan remain open about what form grounding takes. Moreover, whilst\nthere may be genuine questions about what the ground is for the truth\nof the representation that p there may be further questions\nabout what makes it the case that p and these questions will\ntypically have nothing to do with representation as such. Because\ntruth-making is typically understood in modal terms, i.e.\nnecessitation is conceived to be sufficient for truth-making, Fine is\nalso sceptical that there is any way of avoiding the over-generation\nof truth-makers we have already discussed (see 1.1 and 1.2 above).\nFinally, Fine thinks that we should be able to conceive of the world\nhierarchically, whereby (e.g.) the normative is grounded in the\nnatural, the natural in the physical and the physical in the\nmicro-physical. But this is difficult to do if we think in terms of\ntruth-making, because if (e.g.) we conceive of a normative\nrepresentation being made true by the existence of something natural,\nthat natural thing is just the wrong sort of thing to be made true by\nsomething at the physical level because it is not a representation.\n\n\nLiggins (2012) maintains, like Fine, that the theory of truth-making\nis inevitably less general than a theory of grounding. But Liggins\nalso argues that appealing to grounding obviates the need to appeal to\ntruth-makers in the sense that (e.g.) Armstrong maintained. This is\nbecause one significant reason for positing truth-makers is that doing\nso enables us to explain the asymmetric sense in which truth depends\nupon being (see sec. 3.2 below). But, Liggins maintains, this can\nalready be done in terms of grounding, by saying that the fact that p\ngrounds the fact that a certain proposition is true, namely the\nproposition that p. According to Liggins, this isn\u2019t a case of\ntruth-making because the relation of grounding invoked holds solely\nbetween two facts, albeit one of them a fact about a proposition, that\nit is true, rather than, as Liggins reads the requirements of\ntruth-maker theory, a relation holding between something and a\nproposition. \n\nFine\u2019s critique of truth-making presupposes that we can only avail\nourselves of truth-making if we conceive of truth-making in monolithic\nterms, as providing a unique method for metaphysics. But whilst, for\nexample, Armstrong may have had a tendency to think in such terms,\nthis doesn\u2019t appear to be mandated by the nature of truth-making\nitself. One might, as Asay (2017) argues, instead conceive of\ngrounding and truth-making as complementary projects, whereby a theory\nof truth-making doesn\u2019t purport to do everything a theory of\ngrounding does and so reciprocal illumination remains a live\npossibility. Indeed one might already think of the aforementioned\ndefinitions or elucidations of truth-making, which are designed in\nterms of a hyperintensional notion of grounding in order to avoid\nover-generation of truthmakers as one way in which grounding is\nalready being used to illuminate truth-making. \n\nThe second approach, outlined above, refusing grounding but favouring\ntruth-making, is advanced by Heil (2016). Heil is generally suspicious\nof grounding because, he points out, grounding is often characterized\nin different and incompatible ways, so he is sceptical that there is a\nunivocal concept of grounding to be had. But, more specifically, Heil\nhas long maintained that hierarchical conceptions of reality spell\ntrouble because of the difficulties explaining the causal and\nnomological relationship between the layers (Heil 2003: 31\u20139). He\nargues that this was the problem identified for supervenience and\nrealization in the \u201890s and it\u2019s a problem inherited by the\nhierarchical conception of reality to which grounding gives rise. So\nHeil does a modus tollens where Fine does a modus ponens. Whilst Fine\nconceives of the hierarchical styles of explanation grounding provides\nas one of the principal virtues of grounding, Heil considers this is\none of the deepest drawbacks of grounding. By contrast with Fine, Heil\ninstead recommends truth-making as the proper methodology for\nmetaphysics because it enables us to give a non-hierarchical\ndescription of reality whereby fundamental physics gives us the\ntruth-makers for truths that have truth-makers. Further and\nindependent objections to grounding include whether the notion of\ngrounding is intelligible (Daly 2012), theoretically unified (MacBride\n2013b), theoretically illuminating (Wilson 2014) or the result of a\ncognitive illusion (Miller and Norton 2017).\n\nOther available positions include: that truth making is a special kind\nof grounding which involves a unique form of dependence (Griffith\n2013), and that truth making isn\u2019t grounding but that grounding\nis key to truthmaking (Saenz 2018). \n",
