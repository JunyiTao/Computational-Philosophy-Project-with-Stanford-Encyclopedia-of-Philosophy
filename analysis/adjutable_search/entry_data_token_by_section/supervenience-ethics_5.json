    "main_text": "Arguments for Ethical Supervenience\n2. Arguments for Ethical Supervenience\n\nIt is common for philosophers to endorse ethical supervenience without\nmuch argument (an important exception is Smith 2004; for critical\ndiscussion of a variety of the arguments that have been offered, see\nRoberts 2018, 10\u201318). Part of the reason for this is that\nethical supervenience is taken to be both obvious and uncontroversial.\n(Rosen 2020 calls it \u201cThe least controversial thesis in\nmetaethics\u201d.) Further, ethical supervenience is often claimed or\nassumed to be an obvious conceptual truth, doubts about which are\nsupposed to reveal conceptual incompetence. The discussion just\ncompleted, however, suggests reason to worry about this assumption:\nthere is not one ethical supervenience thesis but instead a complex\nvariety of such theses. It is far from clear that we should accept all\nof these theses, and a substantive question how to assess each of\nthem. Given that supervenience claims are modal claims, those seeking\nto evaluate supervenience claims might begin by considering the\ngeneral question of how we can know modal facts (see the entry\n modality-epistemology/).\n\nThis section sets aside this broad question. Instead, it begins by\nsetting out a general strategy for arguing for ethical supervenience.\nIt then explores the implications of that strategy for the\ncontroversies introduced in the previous section.\n\nThe general argumentative strategy has two elements. The first element\ndefends ethical supervenience as a plausible generalization from\ncases. Thus, consider our orienting case of the embezzling bank\nmanager. This case provides us with a specific ethical\nsupervenience thesis: it suggests that the ethical quality of the\nmanager\u2019s action cannot vary without something else varying as\nwell (compare Horgan and Timmons 1992, 226 on specific\nsupervenience facts). Next, notice that there is nothing special\nin this respect about the bank manager case: we can identify specific\nsupervenience facts about anything from genocide to insulting your\nneighbor\u2019s hat. Each such fact is constituted by an interesting\nnecessary connection between ethical properties and some base\nproperties. It is theoretically unattractive to rest satisfied with a\nlong list of such necessary connections. Instead, we should look for a\nsingle thesis that unifies all of these specific theses into a single\npattern. This pattern can be captured by a general ethical\nsupervenience thesis such as Initial (compare McPherson 2012,\n211).\n\nThe second element of the general strategy for arguing for ethical\nsupervenience emphasizes the independent credibility of such a general\nsupervenience thesis. This element takes inspiration from a comment by\nHenry Sidgwick:\n\nIn the variety of coexistent physical facts we find an accidental or\narbitrary element in which we have to acquiesce\u2026. But within\nthe range of our cognitions of right and wrong, it will be generally\nagreed that we cannot admit a similar unexplained variation. (1907,\n209)\n\n\nIt is plausible to interpret Sidgwick as suggesting that although we\nseek explanatory power when we develop our account of the physical\nworld, we need to be prepared to admit brute contingency: the\npossibility that our best theories or explanations include claims like\n\u201cand these just happened to be the initial conditions\u201d, or\n(to be anachronistic) \u201cit is a brute fact that the quantum wave\nfunction collapsed this way\u201d. By contrast, we cannot\nadmit the analogous idea that it is a brute contingent fact that a\ncertain ethical property just happens to covary with the base\nproperties that are instantiated around here. Because of their modal\nscope, ethical supervenience theses reflect this ban on brute ethical\ncontingency (compare also Shafer-Landau 2003, 78; Smith 2004,\n225).\n\nThe two parts of the strategy complement each other: The first part of\nthe strategy defends general ethical supervenience on the basis of\nunification, which is a familiar and domain-general theoretical\nvirtue. The second part of the strategy suggests that we have further\nreasons to accept such a general thesis that stem from a feature of\nour understanding of the ethical domain specifically.\n\nWhile Initial is a general supervenience thesis, it is silent on many\nof the issues broached in\n Section 1.\n The next task is thus to extend the strategy just introduced to\ndiscuss those issues. Before doing so, it is important to emphasize\nthat many of the options considered in that section are\ncompatible: for example, supervenience on the natural\nproperties entails supervenience on all of the properties. Because of\nthis, an argument for the former thesis is not an argument against the\nlatter thesis. Because stronger ethical supervenience theses are\npotentially both more illuminating and more dialectically significant,\nthis section will focus on examining competing cases concerning what\nthe strongest well-supported ethical supervenience thesis\nis.\n\nThe general strategy just canvassed has two stages: the first stage\ncarefully examines cases, and the second appeals to our more general\nunderstanding of the ethical. Both parts of the strategy can be useful\nin addressing the question of what the ethical supervenes on. For\nexample,\n Section 1.1\n appealed to possible cases involving supernatural beings as part of\nan argument against the idea that the ethical supervenes on the\nnatural. In terms of the first part of the strategy, this suggests\nthat once we make salient the possibility of supernatural beings,\nethical supervenience theses that posit a naturalistic base become\nmore doubtful. In terms of the second part of the strategy, the same\ncases fit nicely with the Sidgwickian thesis: if an ethical claim were\ntrue in part because of some supernatural truth, it would thereby not\nbe brutely true. As noted in\n Section 1.1,\n characterizing what the ethical supervenes on is an open challenge.\nThis merely illustrates how the strategy can be applied to make\nprogress on that challenge.\n\nThe general strategy can also be applied to the structural question:\nfor example,\n Section 1.2\n noted that weak supervenience is compatible with the idea that a\nutilitarian ethical principle is a fundamental truth in some possible\nworlds, but is false in others. Strong ethical supervenience, by\ncontrast, is incompatible with this idea. Many philosophers believe\nthat the fundamental ethical principles could not vary contingently in\nthis way, because this would again threaten to entail that some\nfundamental ethical truths are brute contingencies. If correct, this\nsupports the idea that ethical supervenience is a strong supervenience\nthesis. On the other hand, assessing whether ethical supervenience is\nstrong or global (or both) might require adjudicating live\nmetaphysical controversies concerning the relationship between strong\nand global supervenience (for discussion of these controversies, see\nsection 4.3.1 of the entry on\n supervenience).\n\nWhat about the modality of ethical supervenience? One might\nthink of this question as seeking to clarify what sort of\nnon-contingency the Sidgwickian commitment requires. If we distinguish\nlogical from conceptual necessity, it is easy to see that the\nlogical supervenience of the ethical is a non-starter. The\ntruth of \u2018pain is bad\u2019, e.g., is not secured simply by the\nlogical vocabulary and the syntax of the sentence, in the way that the\ntruth of \u2018all bachelors are bachelors\u2019 seemingly is.\n\nThe most common view in the literature is that the supervenience of\nthe ethical is a conceptual truth. Here we cannot simply adapt the\ngeneral strategy used so far, since neither the cases nor the\ninference to the best explanation from those cases seems to settle the\nmatter. Consider three reasons to think that ethical supervenience is\na conceptual truth.\n\nFirst, to adapt R. M. Hare\u2019s canonical example (1952,\n\u00a75.2), if I mentioned to you that one possible act was right, and\nanother wrong, despite these acts being exactly alike in all other\nrespects, your initial reaction would be puzzlement, and if I\npersisted in my view upon interrogation, you might start to worry that\nI was simply confused or misusing words. Second, the crucial cases\nused to support supervenience\u2014like the embezzling banker\ncase\u2014seem to involve conceivability reasoning: we are\nasked to consider two circumstances that are identical in all base\nrespects, and notice that we cannot make sense of the idea that they\ndiffer in ethical respects. Some philosophers find it natural to think\nthat conceivability reasoning first and foremost reveals facts about\nconceptual possibility and necessity. This can be bolstered by a third\n(much more controversial) thought. Conceivability reasoning appears to\nbe a priori. But if such reasoning fundamentally concerned the world\nrather than our concepts, then we would seemingly have a priori access\nto substantive facts about the world, which many philosophers have\nfound deeply mysterious.\n\nEach of the sorts of reasons just offered is controversial. Consider\nthree examples of this controversy. First, it is controversial whether\nthe sorts of puzzlement reactions identified by Hare must signal\nconceptual confusion or misuse (Kramer 2009, Harrison 2013). For\nexample, perhaps we take ethical supervenience claims to be so obvious\nthat when someone appears to deny them, we are inclined to treat\nconceptual confusion or difference as a charitable hypothesis. One\npotential piece of evidence for this is that when denial of ethical\nsupervenience is based upon reasoned arguments, such as those\nmentioned in\n Section 5\n below, a diagnosis of conceptual confusion or difference arguably\nbecome less plausible diagnosis.\n\nSecond, philosophers unafraid of the \u2018synthetic a priori\u2019\ncan reject the inference from conceivability reasoning to conceptual\nstatus. It is notable here that a great deal of work in contemporary\nmetaphysics appeals to something like conceivability reasoning to\nargue directly for claims about the nature of reality. Third, the very\nnotion of conceptual truth is hotly contested: many philosophers have\nbecome convinced that there is no notion of conceptual truth that is\nboth coherent and philosophically interesting (for discussion, see the\nentry on the\n analytic-synthetic distinction).\n\nSet aside these challenges for the moment, and consider how we should\ninterpret the idea that ethical supervenience is a conceptual truth.\nWe saw above that there is some support for thinking that ethical\nsupervenience is a strong supervenience thesis. But combining this\nidea with the idea that the modality of supervenience is conceptual\nleads to complications. To see the issue, recall the schema for Strong\nSupervenience:\n\nStrong\n\nNecessarily, if anything x has some ethical property\nF, then there is at least one base property G such\nthat x has G, and necessarily everything\nthat has G has F.\n\n\nIf we interpret the claim that ethical supervenience is conceptual by\nreplacing \u2018Necessarily\u2019 in the schema with \u2018it is a\nconceptual truth that\u2019. The result is:\n\nStrong Conceptual\n\nIt is a conceptual truth that if anything x has some\nethical property F, then there is some base property\nG such that x has G, and it is a\nconceptual truth that everything that has G also has\nF.\n\n\nOne central problem with Strong Conceptual is that it claims that for\nevery instantiated ethical property, there is a base property such\nthat: it is a conceptual truth that anything that has this base\nproperty also has the ethical property. And this consequence will seem\ndefensible only on certain very controversial views about ethics and\nconceptual analysis.\n\nThe implausibility of Strong Conceptual may explain why two of the\nmost influential philosophers who discussed supervenience in ethics\n\u2014R. M. Hare (1984, 4) and Simon Blackburn (cf. 1985, 134, and\nthe contrast between \u2018supervenience\u2019 and\n\u2018necessity\u2019 in 1984, 183\u20134.)\u2014seemed to accept\nsomething like weak but not strong conceptual supervenience of the\nethical.\n\nHowever, as noted above, it appears that we have reason to accept\nsomething stronger than weak ethical supervenience (Shoemaker 1987,\n440\u20131; for dissent see Miller 2017). It is thus worth\nconsidering alternatives that capture that strength without succumbing\nto the difficulties facing Strong Conceptual. One way to avoid the\nproblem is to interpret the first necessity operator in Strong as\nconceptual, while leaving the second operator as metaphysical:\n\nStrong Mixed\n\nIt is a conceptual truth that if anything x has some ethical\nproperty F, then there is some base property G such that\nx has G, and it is metaphysically necessary\nthat everything that has G also has F (compare\nDreier 1992, 15).\n\n\nThis avoids the implausible implications that Strong Conceptual has:\nStrong Mixed says only that it is a conceptual truth that a certain\nbase property (we may not know which) covaries with each ethical\nproperty.\n\nNote that Strong Mixed is only one possible mixed-modality\nsupervenience thesis: one could reinterpret either necessity operator,\nto produce one of a wide variety of possible mixed ethical\nsupervenience theses. For example, the second necessity operator could\nbe interpreted as normative (rather than metaphysical) necessity. Such\nmixed modality theses have not yet been seriously explored.\n\nAnother option is to offer a conceptual version of the Strong\nIntuitive supervenience thesis mentioned in\n Section 1.2:\n\nIntuitive Conceptual\n\nIf two conceptually possible entities are alike in all base respects,\nthey are alike in all ethical respects.\n\n\nBecause it does not posit known relations between specific ethical and\nbase properties, Intuitive Conceptual does not face the difficulties\nof Strong Conceptual. Intuitive Conceptual also has an advantage over\nStrong Mixed: the latter commits one to metaphysical as well as\nconceptual modality. Intuitive Conceptual is a plausible option for\nphilosophers who take there to be a stronger alternative to weak\nethical supervenience, but who are suspicious of the notion of\nmetaphysical modality.\n\nAmong philosophers who reject the idea that ethical supervenience is a\nconceptual truth, many will insist that the supervenience of the\nethical is at least metaphysically necessary. Most such philosophers\nappear happy to accept the strong metaphysical supervenience of the\nethical. Such philosophers might defend the metaphysical supervenience\nof the ethical by applying the general strategy suggested at the\nbeginning of this section, while rejecting the case for thinking this\nstrategy has specifically conceptual implications. Other philosophers\nwill reject the idea that we should begin with the sorts of judgments\nabout cases that drove the general strategy. They can instead argue\nthat the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical is supported as an\nabstract consequence of the best overall empirical theory concerning\nethical facts (e.g. Sturgeon 2009, 61).\n\nOther philosophers reject the conceptual and metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical, but claim that the ethical supervenes\nnomically or normatively. In general, such supervenience theses are\ntoo weak to support the sorts of arguments from ethical supervenience\nthat philosophers have made. Because of this, arguments for these\ntheses will be discussed in\n Section 5.4,\n which concerns doubts about ethical supervenience.\n\nFinally, how should we decide between ontological and ascriptive\nsupervenience theses? Proponents of ascriptive supervenience take on\nthe obligation of making precise the sort of mistake that\n\u2018supervenience-violators\u2019 are allegedly making, and\ndefending the idea that this is a mistake. The most prominent approach\ntakes the mistake to be conceptual, which involves commitments similar\nto those taken on by defenders of the conceptual supervenience theses\njust discussed.\n\nOne reason to focus on ascriptive supervenience theses is that some\nphilosophers deny that our ethical thought and talk commits us to the\nexistence of ethical facts and properties. Such philosophers can still\ngrant that if we interpret supervenience in an ascriptive way, it\nprovides important insights into ethics. Further, philosophers who\naccept that there are ethical facts and properties can also accept\nascriptive supervenience theses about ethical thought. Indeed, if we\nunderstand Ascriptive as a conceptual claim, then together with\nrealism it could provide the basis for accepting a conceptual-strength\nethical supervenience thesis. This means that ascriptive ethical\nsupervenience theses have the potential to be a point of significant\ncommon ground between philosophers with widely differing views about\nthe nature of ethical thought and talk. And this might make them\nespecially dialectically powerful in arguments that appeal to ethical\nsupervenience.\n",
