    "main_text": "The History of Privacy || History of Legal Protection\n1.3 History of Legal Protection\n\nDuring the twentieth century, the right to privacy was advanced to the\nstatus of a human right. It was a completely novel entry into the\ncatalog contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and it\nis unusual in lacking any predecessors in state constitutions or basic\nlaws. As Diggelmann and Cleis (2014: 441) have pointed out, \u201cthe\nright\u2019s potential was dramatically underestimated at the time of\nits creation\u201d. Having originated in a somewhat accidental\nmanner, the right to privacy has since become one of the most\nimportant human rights (Weil 1963; Volio 1981; Michael 1994; Feldman\n1997; Richardson 2017). Article 12 of the 1948 Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights reads:\n\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,\nfamily, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and\nreputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law\nagainst such interference or attacks.\n\n\n20 years later, the same right was enshrined by Article 17, Paragraph\n1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n(1966), albeit in slightly different terms.\n\nTurning our focus to the history of a right to privacy in Europe in\nparticular, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human\nRights, drafted in 1950, reads somewhat differently while\nexpressing the same idea:\n\n\nEveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his\nhome and his correspondence.\n\n\nIn 1981, the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with\nregard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108)\nprovided specific rules for the protection of personal data (Dalla\nCorte 2020: 125). In 2000, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights\nof the European Union, there was for the first time a formal\ndifferentiation between the two rights: a right to privacy on the one\nhand, and a right to the protection of personal data on the other.\nThis formal distinction was the first in an international declaration\nof rights. Article 7 of the Charter provides a right to\n\u201crespect for private and family life\u201d, and Article 8\nprovides a right to the \u201cprotection of personal data\u201d (see\nalso Gonz\u00e1lez Fuster 2014). The latter plays an important role\nin securing the right to informational privacy.\n\nFurther examination of the history of the rights to privacy and data\nprotection in Europe, reveals several important developments. The\nfirst of these was the step taken in 1983 by the Federal\nConstitutional Court of Germany. In its landmark decision on the\nconstitutionality of the 1983 Census Act, the judgment (BVerfG 65,\n1(43)) was influential in designating the right to privacy as\ninformational self-determination. The ruling stated that\n\n\n[if] individuals cannot, with sufficient certainty, determine what\nkind of personal information is known to certain parts of their social\nenvironment, and if it is difficult to ascertain what kind of\ninformation potential communication partners are privy to, this could\ngreatly impede their freedom to make self-determined plans or\ndecisions. A societal order, and its underlying legal order, would not\nbe compatible with the right to informational self-determination if\ncitizens were no longer able to tell who knows what kind of personal\ninformation about them, at what time and on which occasion.\n\n\nThe next important step was taken in 1995, with the adoption of the\nData Protection Directive by the European Union, which was a\nlegally binding directive (Directive 95/46/EC) adopted by EU member\nstates. The purpose of this directive was twofold: to harmonize data\nprotection laws, so as to facilitate cross-border trade by companies,\nand to protect people\u2019s rights and freedoms when their personal\ndata are used. Thus, the directive was largely based on the rationale\nof market integration. In 2016, the Data Protection Directive was\nfollowed up in Europe by the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR). The GDPR has been in law since 2016, but its provisions became\nenforceable only in 2018. The GDPR is the most consequential\nregulatory development in information policy in decades (see\nLindroos-Hovinheimo 2021), imposing significant fines on companies\nthat fail to comply. As Hoofnagle et al. (2019) explain, the GDPR\nbrings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime.\nMany data protection principles (for instance about data security)\nhave been incorporated into US law as well, albeit mostly in Federal\nTrade Commission settlements with companies (Hoofnagle et al.\n2019).\n\nThe juridification and jurisdiction in the US, especially concerning a\nconstitutional right to privacy, has taken a very different course. On\nthe one hand, there have been many advances with respect to laws\nprotecting informational privacy. While US data protection law is\nfragmented, there have been recent developments that may result in\ncloser alignment with EU law (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy\nAct of 2018 and the American Data Privacy and Protection Act\u2014the\nlatter being a Bill introduced in the US House of Representatives in\n2022).\n\nOn the other hand, the most significant focus in US law is on\ndecisional privacy, the right to make decisions (here with\nrespect to one\u2019s body) without interference from others, i.e.,\non same-sex marriage and abortion. In 1965, a right to privacy,\nindependent of informational privacy and the Fourth Amendment, was\nrecognized explicitly by the Supreme Court. It has commonly been\nreferred to as the constitutional right to privacy. The right was\nfirst recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479),\nwhich overturned the convictions of the Director of Planned Parenthood\nand a doctor at Yale Medical School for dispersing\ncontraceptive-related information, instruction, and medical advice to\nmarried persons. Justice Brennan\u2019s explanation contained the now\nfamous sentence:\n\n\nThe right to privacy gives an individual, married or\nsingle, the right to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion\ninto matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision\nwhether to bear or beget a child.\n\n\nThe constitutional right to privacy was described by Justice William\nO. Douglas as protecting a zone of privacy covering the social\ninstitution of marriage and the sexual relations of married persons.\n(For further commentary, see Allen 1988; Jean Cohen 1992; Inness 1992;\nTribe 1990; DeCew 1997; Turkington & Allen 1999.)\n\nDespite controversy over Douglas\u2019s opinion, the constitutional\nprivacy right was soon relied on to overturn a prohibition on\ninterracial marriage, to allow individuals to possess obscene matter\nin their own homes, and to allow the distribution of contraceptive\ndevices to individuals, both married and single. However, the most\nfamous application of this right to privacy was as one justification\nfor a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, a right defended in the\n1973 judgment of Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113). It has since\nbeen used in subsequent legal decisions on abortion. As the\nexplanation formulated by Justice Blackmun famously put it,\n\n\nthis right of privacy\u2026 is broad enough to encompass a\nwoman\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\n(Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 [1973]: 153; see Dworkin 1994)\n\n\nBork (1990), however, views the Griswold v. Connecticut\ndecision as an attempt by the Supreme Court to take a side on a social\nand cultural issue, and as an example of bad constitutional law (for\ncriticism of Bork\u2019s view, see Inness 1992; Schoeman 1992;\nJohnson 1994; DeCew 1997).\n\nRegardless of anything else it might be, the right to privacy was seen\nas a right that incorporates reproductive liberties. Precisely which\npersonal decisions regarding reproductive liberties have been\nprotected by this right to privacy has varied depending on the makeup\nof the Court at any given time. For example, in the 1986 Bowers v.\nHardwick judgment (478 U.S. 186; Subsequently overturned in\nLawrence v. Texas 2003), it was decided that this right did\nnot render anti-sodomy laws in Georgia unconstitutional, despite the\nintimate sexual relations involved.\n\nIn June 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health\nOrganization (No. 19\u20131392, 597 U.S.), the Supreme Court (then\nwith a majority of Conservative judges) overruled its previous\ndecision in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v.\nCasey (505 U.S. 833 [1992]). The majority argued that abortion\ncannot be counted as a constitutional right, since the constitution\ndoes not mention it, and abortion was not \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d\nin American history. More specifically, the court argued that the\nright to privacy implied by the Fourteenth Amendment does not include\na woman\u2019s right to abortion. As a consequence of Dobbs v.\nJackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, individual states have\nthe power to regulate access to abortion (see Tribe 2022).\n\nNote that the debate in the US is mostly focused on aspects of\ndecisional privacy. In Europe, the right to same sex marriage, as well\nas the right to abortion, are conceived of as rights to personal\nfreedom, and have therefore not been discussed in the context of\ntheories of privacy.
