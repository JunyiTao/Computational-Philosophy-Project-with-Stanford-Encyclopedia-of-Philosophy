    "main_text": "Nicholas\u2019 Thought || Metaphysics and ontology\n2.1 Metaphysics and ontology\n\nNicholas of Cusa\u2019s most complete set of proposals about what is\nreal occurs in his best-known work of 1440, De docta\nignorantia: On Learned Ignorance. Here Cusanus addresses\nthe four categorical realities traditionally found in Christian\nthought: God, the natural universe, Christ and human beings. On\nLearned Ignorance devotes its first book to God, the second to\nthe universe and a third to the God-man, Jesus Christ. While its order\nmirrors the outflow from God and return to him, this book does not\ndistinguish philosophy and theology as contemporary thinkers might,\nbut unites them in a single overview of Neoplatonic Christian\nreality.\n\nNicholas begins with a single trope or symbol to lay out the parallels\nbetween his teachings in the three books, that of the\n\u201cmaximum.\u201d God is the absolute Maximum; the universe is a\ncreated image of God, the \u201ccontracted\u201d or restricted\nmaximum. Christ unites the first two as the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. \u201cContraction\u201d is a metaphor for\nthe finite status of creatures, all of whom are limited images of God.\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d is used in its etymological sense of\n\u201cfree from\u201d (ab-solutus) to characterize\nGod\u2019s infinity. As absolute maximum God is both unlimited and\ntranscendent, unreachable by human conceptions that measure the\nlimited or contracted realm of more and less. Once Cusanus\nconceptualizes human knowing as measuring, he proposes that our\nknowledge also cannot measure exactly the essence of any limited\nthing. A fortiori, when it comes to the unlimited God, Nicholas\nasserts that \u201cthere is no proportion between finite and\ninfinite.\u201d The infinite God remains beyond our ken. Human\nefforts to understand the depth and implications of this assertion are\nwhat will render our ignorance \u201clearn-ed.\u201d\n\nAs so often in Christian thinking, this sort of apophatic preamble\ndoes not prevent Cusanus from spending a whole book proposing how we\nmight comprehend the incomprehensible God\n\u201cincomprehensibly.\u201d His first proposal is that God is the\n\u201ccoincidence of opposites.\u201d This turns out to be a way\nboth of recalling the negative theology to be found in Dionysius the\nAreopagite and his other predecessors and at the same time of going\nbeyond it. Put in the language of the \u201cmaximum,\u201d in God\nboth maximum and minimum coincide in the divine infinite Oneness, for\nboth take the mind beyond the measurable created domain of more and\nless and end up meaning just the \u201csuperlative\u201d or\ntranscendent. The implication, in other words, is that God\u2019s\nreality lies beyond any familiar domain where the principle of\ncontradiction holds sway.\n\nAt the same time this \u201ccoincidence\u201d underlines the divine\nOneness that comprehends all else in undifferentiated and unlimited\nunity. It is not that creatures coincide with God or God with\ncreatures, but that in God all else coincides as nothing else than\nGod. As so often in negative and apophatic \u201ctheology,\u201d we\nare not only told what God is not but led to reflect explicitly on\nwhat God must be, even if we have no conceptual clarity about what we\nassert. The result is a kind of second-order language about the ways\nin which we are forced to think and talk about divinity.\n\nNicholas then proposes some geometrical \u201cexercises\u201d to\nprovide his readers some object lessons designed to teach how we might\nreach for the unlimited even while we are aware that we cannot grasp\nwhat the infinite God may be. For instance, we are to imagine a circle\nand a straight line or tangent that meets the circle. From a certain\nperspective, as the diameter or circumference of the circle increases,\nits circumference approaches the straight line and appears less and\nless curved. If we then imagine and extrapolate the circumference to\nthe infinite, we can almost \u201csee\u201d that both straight\ntangent and curved circumference should coincide\u2014a kind of\n\u201ccoincidence of opposites\u201d that is a figure of how we may\nthink beyond limited things toward the transcendent One. All this is\nmathematically impossible, of course, but it demonstrates some\nmetaphorical steps for moving beyond the finite toward the infinite\nthat might be transferred from geometrical figures to created beings\nand their Creator.\n\nIn Book II of On Learned Ignorance Cusanus deals with the\ncreated universe. The natural universe counts as the limited or\ncontracted maximum that is the image of the absolute Maximum. Here\nNicholas introduces another central metaphor to capture the\nrelationship between God and creatures, the metaphor of enfolding and\nunfolding (complicatio/explicatio). He expands the\n\u201cfolding\u201d metaphor he inherited from the twelfth-century\nschool of Chartres. While all beings are \u201cenfolded\u201d in the\nundifferentiated oneness of their Divine Source, they are at the same\ntime an \u201cunfolding\u201d of God in time and space.\n\u201cInsofar as He is the unfolding,\u201d Nicholas writes,\n\u201cin all things He is that which they are, just as in an image\nthe reality itself [veritas] is present\u201d (II.3, Hopkins\ntranslation). In Neoplatonic terms, one must think the unfolded\nuniverse we experience and all that is real in it as at once enfolded\nin the Creator on whom it depends. God encompasses every thing created\nin a dialectical outflow and return to God without any creatures ever\nbeing identified with the God on whom they depend, that One who\nremains both present to them yet ever absent and beyond. What the\n\u201cunfolding/enfolding\u201d couple captures is the dynamic\nrelationship between divine Original and created image.\n\nThe natural universe, then, is the whole or contracted maximum\ncollectively constituted by the many beings in space and time.\nNicholas proposes the quasi-Anaxagorean slogan that \u201ceach thing\nis in each thing: quodlibet in quolibet\u201d to emphasize\nthat the individual beings or parts are no less\n\u201ccontracted\u201d images of the whole created universe. Just as\nGod is present to each creature that stands as a contracted image of\nthe divine, so the universe as a macrocosm is present to each creature\nor constitutive part as microcosm. In that way, each natural thing is\nan image of the collective whole. But since this collectivity is made\nup of interrelated parts, each thing is also the totality of its\nconnections with everything else. \u201cEach thing is in each\nthing\u201d because each is an image reflecting the oneness of the\nwhole and thus of all other individuals that are the interrelated\nparts of that whole.\n\nNicholas also recognizes in Book Two that the natural universe is\ncharacterized by change or motion; it is not static in time and space.\nBut finite change and motion, ontologically speaking, are also matters\nof more and less and have no fixed maximum or minimum. This\n\u201contological relativity\u201d leads Cusanus to some remarkable\nconclusions about the earth and the physical universe, based not on\nempirical observation but on metaphysical grounds. The earth is not\nfixed in place at some given point because nothing is utterly at rest;\nnor can it be the exact physical center of the natural universe, even\nif it seems nearer the center than \u201cthe fixed stars.\u201d\nBecause the universe is in motion without fixed center or boundaries,\nnone of the spheres of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic world picture\nare exactly spherical. None of them has an exact center, and the\n\u201coutermost sphere\u201d is not a boundary. The universe is\ntherefore \u201cinfinite,\u201d in the sense of physically\nunbounded. Cusanus thus shifts the typical medieval picture of the\ncreated universe toward later views, but on ontological grounds.\n\nFor Nicholas, the exact center and circumference of the created\nuniverse are to be found only in God. What we take to be\ncenter and outer limits depends on our viewpoint. If we change\nperspectives, say to that from another planet (which might indeed be\ninhabited) and take it to be center, then earth might be zenith. In\nthis way we come to realize that what is taken as fixed or central can\nbe altered to be moving and at the zenith, depending on the location\nof the standpoint we pick in the unbounded universe. The reason,\nCusanus writes, is that there is no exactness outside of God, and only\n\u201cGod, who is everywhere and nowhere, is its [the\nuniverse\u2019s] circumference and center\u201d (II.12, Hopkins\ntranslation).\n\nIn this way learned ignorance recognizes that the natural universe\nitself, as a contracted image of God, has a physical center that can\nbe anywhere and a circumference that is nowhere. That is why Nicholas\ncharacterized the natural universe as a contracted maximum or\n\u201cprivative\u201d infinite while God remains the\n\u201cnegative\u201d infinite or absolute maximum. This means that\nthe universe merely lacks set physical bounds or limits, while God has\nno ontological limits in being all that can possibly be. This enables\nthe \u201cinfinite\u201d universe, as the whole constituted by all\ncreatures, to be an image of the divine oneness, but only in a\ncontracted or attenuated fashion.\n\nNowhere is the Christian bearing of On Learned Ignorance more\nobvious than in Book III, where Nicholas treats of the God-man, Jesus\nChrist, as a third \u201cmaximum,\u201d the Maximum at once\nabsolute-and-contracted. Once again, however, Cusanus uses the\northodox teaching of early Christian councils such as Chalcedon more\nas a background guide than as providing a straightforward Christology\nor text for exposition. He returns to the contrast between absolute\nGod and contracted creatures that he used throughout Books I and II to\ninterpret and contrast the relation between infinite God and finite\ncreatures, even though there is no real proportion between them.\n\nGod was construed as the absolute maximum and divine infinite Oneness,\nwhile Nicholas viewed the natural universe as a contracted maximum\nwhose unity-in-multiplicity and lack of physical limits\n\u201creflected\u201d God\u2019s positively unlimited oneness.\nNicholas now entertains a third possibility, an anomalous joining of\nabsolute and contracted in the God-man. He reviews, borrowing from\nAristotle, the ordered universe of things belonging to natural types\n(genera and species), then modifies it by extending to individuals his\nidea of contraction or limitation. Individual specimens are all that\nexist, but not only are they contracted images of God\u2019s oneness,\nbut also contracted images of their types insofar as each more or less\nfulfills the possibilities of its nature.\n\nCusanus thereupon asks a hypothetical question. What would happen were\na perfect specimen, an individual fulfillment of its type, to actually\nexist? In his language of maximality, it would be another maximum\ncontracted to a unique individual of a given kind. But what would make\nsuch a maximum individual possible in a universe of more or less? Only\nits unique union with God, the absolute divine Maximum that is the\nsource of every contracted reality, a union signaled in the\ntraditional \u201chypostatic union.\u201d The whole of this maximal\nyet finite human nature is created and united with the absolute God so\nthat God remains transcendent, yet inseparable from this one human\ncreature. In terms of enfolding and unfolding, this unique unfolding\nin a human being is at the same time to reveal the God enfolding Jesus\nChrist. Jesus is an image of God so utterly transparent as to remain\nopaque except to the eyes of faith.\n\nCusanus relies on the traditional microcosm/macrocosm trope to explain\nwhy human nature would be the contracted nature best suited for union\nwith the divine Absolute. Human nature is the created nature\n\u201cmore common to the totality of beings\u201d (III.3, Hopkins\ntranslation) because the intermediate status of human beings between\nangels and all other bodily creatures provides common ties to the\nwhole range of created things. These ties are based on its capacities\nas \u201cwhat is highest of the lower and what is lowest of the\nhigher\u201d natures (ibid.), so that it stands as\nrepresentative microcosm of the created macrocosm. The upshot is that\nthe historical Jesus Christ is human in such a way as to be divine\nand divine in such a way as to be human, the Maximum at once\ncontracted and absolute, the human image who is\nsimultaneously the divine Original. Because the divine Word is one\nwith Jesus\u2019 human nature, that nature is perfect of its kind, at\nthe same time contracted and maximal. Learned ignorance may thus press\nthe Cusan metaphors and ideas to the limit in dealing with Jesus\nChrist, because the hypostatic oneness of the incarnate God will\nalways elude full human understanding.\n\nThis third book realigns the order of Christian metaphysics so that\nthe God-man stands between God and the rest of creation, for it is\nthrough the mediation of the Incarnate Word that creatures are made\nand creatures return to their source. In Book I, Nicholas proposed\nthat there is no proportion or measure between the infinite and the\nfinite that will enable us to grasp the Infinite God or even\nGod\u2019s contracted image in the natural universe. This is what\nlearned ignorance establishes for and contributes to human wisdom. Yet\nthe historic reality of Jesus Christ has a theoretical role to play in\ninterpreting Nicholas\u2019 metaphysical vision. The Cusan Christ\nstands as a more adequate norm and measure for theory and practice.\nJesus Christ is the historical human image of the Absolute One beyond\nour ken and thus the paradigm that reveals our creaturely connection\nwith the infinite God. Christ is the disclosure in time of what God\nis. In this way learned ignorance points to Jesus Christ as the\nmedium, the measure and mediator between finite and infinite,\nand, as well, the concrete norm for what human beings may become.\n\nThe three books of On Learned Ignorance thus represent a\nseries of powerful proposals for reinterpreting Christian reality.\nThroughout Nicholas uses metaphors such as the coincidence of\nopposites, absolute/contracted and enfolding/unfolding to relate God\nand creation. His proposals are established by seeking out parallels\nbetween the infinite divine Original and limited created images and by\ndrawing out the implications of these parallels. This book is neither\nmedieval Aristotelian scholastic disputation nor later Cartesian\nrationalism, but its own kind of Christian Neoplatonic speculation\nthat teases the philosophical imagination as much as it may frustrate\nany contemporary philosophical search for arguments or proofs. It is\nthe coherence of the parallels or correspondences within the overall\nview of reality that gives Cusan metaphysics and Cusan metaphors their\npersuasive power.\n",
