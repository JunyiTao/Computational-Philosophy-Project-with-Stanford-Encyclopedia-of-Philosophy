    "main_text": "Metaphysical Arguments\n3. Metaphysical Arguments\n\nThe debate between particularists and generalists is often framed in\nmetaphysical terms. In this guise, the debate primarily concerns\nprinciples conceived as standards. Moral principles might then be\nthought of as true and law-like generalizations about moral properties\nor, alternatively, as nomic regularities involving moral properties.\nTo be clear, generalizations in the relevant sense need not actually\nbe instantiated to be true; plausibly, the moral law would still be\ntrue in a world with no agents and hence with no right or wrong\nactions. This view has been developed, in different ways, by McKeever\nand Ridge (2006), V\u00e4yrynen (2006, 2009) and Lance and Little\n(2007), though it is not universally accepted (see Robinson 2008,\n2011). Thus understood, particularism is often taken to have an\naffinity with non-reductive or non-naturalist views in ethics.\nFurthermore, it has been noted that contemporary particularism arose\nalongside a resurgence of interest in non-naturalism (cf. Little,\n1994). To a degree, this is understandable. After all some\nnaturalist views appear to entail generalism. A form of reductive\nnaturalism according to which being morally right is metaphysically\nidentical with being an act which maximizes human happiness appears to\nentail a robust utilitarian principle and so, a fortiori, to\nentail generalism. Furthermore, if one denies any kind of reduction of\nmoral properties to natural properties then it becomes more difficult\nto see how any informative statements connecting moral and non-moral\nproperties could be sufficiently law-like to count as principles.\nNevertheless, one ought not to take it as given that non-naturalists\nmust be particularists or that naturalists must be generalists. Both\nclassic and contemporary non-naturalists have endeavored to defend\nprinciples (Moore 1922 [1903]; Shafer-Landau 2003). Furthermore, there\nmay be room for particularists to embrace naturalism by claiming that\nparticular reasons are always grounded in some particular natural\nproperty instance while maintaining particularism by claiming that\nthere are no law-like generalizations connecting moral and non-moral\nproperty types. Perhaps because the commitments and resources of\nnon-naturalist and naturalist views in metaethics (and even how\nproperly to distinguish these views from each other) remains\ncontested, one cannot uncontroversially map the\ngeneralism/particularism debate onto the naturalism/non-naturalism\ndebate.\n\nNon-naturalism would seem to have less bearing on a further question:\nwhether there are moral principles connecting one moral property to\nanother. This issue is at play in Ross\u2019s rejection of\nMoore\u2019s claim that the right action is the action which\nmaximizes the good. Even if Ross relied on Moore\u2019s own\n\u201copen question\u201d strategy to challenge Moore\u2019s\nutilitarian principle, it is nevertheless the case that Moore\u2019s\nprinciple is at least consistent with non-naturalism. More recently,\nphilosophers sympathetic to particularism have divided over the\navailability of intra-moral principles. Some are content to allow that\na claim such as, \u201cthe fact that an action is just is a reason in\nits favour\u201d, is true and informative (cf. McNaughton and Rawling\n2000). Others propose a more radical particularism according to which\neven intra-moral principles\u2014that is, principles linking one\nmoral concept with another\u2014are unavailable (cf. Dancy 2004: ch\n7).\n\nNaturalists and non-naturalists typically share a commitment to\nsupervenience. Roughly put, supervenience says that, necessarily,\nthere can be no moral difference without some natural (or non-moral)\ndifference. There are various ways to interpret supervenience and its\nmetaphysical significance. So long as we reject a global error theory,\nthough, supervenience seems to guarantee some necessarily true\nuniversal generalizations involving moral predicates.\n\nNevertheless, it is generally agreed by all sides that such\n\u201csupervenience functions\u201d should not count as moral\nprinciples. The grounds offered for this are various, but include that\nsuch generalizations contain much potentially irrelevant information,\nthat they are massively disjunctive, and that they lack explanatory\nimport (cf. Little 2000; Dancy 2004; McKeever and Ridge 2005). The\nidea is that to be a successful moral principle (qua\nstandard) requires more than a true or even necessary connection\nbetween the descriptive and the moral. The connection must be\nexplanatory and not cite irrelevant features in the antecedent either.\nEven those who gesture at supervenience in mounting arguments for\ngeneralism concede that a successful argument requires significant\nadditional semantic or epistemological premises (see below, and cf.\nJackson, Pettit, & Smith 2000).\n\nMore recently the metaphysical status of principles (as standards) has\nbeen taken up by philosophers exploring the metaphysical relation of\ngrounding. These philosophers agree that moral principles must be law\nlike and that they must be metaphysically explanatory but defend\nimportantly different positions on the specific role principles play.\nOn one view (Rosen 2017a; 2017b; Enoch 2019), we should allow that\nmoral principles themselves serve as the partial grounds for\nparticular moral facts. By analogy, one might think that a particular\nlegal fact is partially grounded by non-legal facts, say facts about\nwhat someone did while also being partially grounded in legal facts to\nthe effect that conduct such as that has a certain legal status.\nSimilarly, entirely non-moral facts or properties would not be\nsufficient to ground particular moral facts. A moral principle or in\nRosen\u2019s terminology a bridge law is needed. If this bridge law\nis not itself grounded in non-moral facts, then this variety of\ngeneralism constitutes a form of non-naturalism. One route for the\ngeneralists to avoid any commitment to non-naturalism is to adopt a\nmore deflationary of account of moral principles according to which\nmoral principles do not serve as even the partial grounds of\nparticular moral facts. On this view, developed and defended by Berker\n(2019), moral principles are \u201cexplanation serving\u201d because\nthey refer to the non-moral properties that, themselves, fully ground\nparticular moral facts.\n\nWhile particularism has strong affinities with non-naturalism, the\nmost prominent argument for particularism\u2014the argument from the\nholism of reasons\u2014has proceeded from a more targeted and\nspecific claim about the metaphysics of moral reasons (see McNaughton\n1988; Dancy 1993; Little 2000). According to holism about reasons, a\nconsideration that counts as a reason in one case may not count as a\nreason in another case, or may count as a reason, but in a different\ndirection. By way of illustration, the fact that a remark would be\nfunny might be, in one case a reason for making the remark, in another\ncase a reason against making the remark, and in still another case no\nreason at all. In short it depends on context. Importantly, holism is\nmeant to be a universal and modal claim. It says that for any\nconsideration that is a reason it is possible that that consideration\nmight behave differently in another case. Thus understood, holism is\nconsistent with the possibility that some considerations are, as a\nmatter of fact, reasons (of the same force and direction) in every\ncase. Holism also seems to presuppose that the considerations that are\nreasons are not brutely unique; the insight of holism\u2014if it is\nan insight\u2014is built upon the thought that a consideration which\nis a reason in one case is repeatable in other cases. Only if, for\nexample, the funniness of a remark is a consideration that is\nrepeatable can we say, as the holist wants us to, that the funniness\nof a remark is a reason in one case but is not a reason in\nanother.\n\nThose attracted to holism about reasons agree that it is typically\nspecific elements of context that further account for whether a\nconsideration counts as a reason, and a rich language for\ncharacterizing context has been developed. For example, a putative\nreason might be defeated, enabled, or intensified by specific elements\nof the context. To continue the previous example, the fact that a\ngenuinely funny remark would also be offensive might defeat whatever\nreason-giving force that the humor might otherwise have had. On this\nreading, the humor of the remark is no reason at all; not just a\nreason that is outweighed. To vary the case again, the fact that\none\u2019s audience will appreciate a (non-offensive) funny remark\nenables the humor to be a reason. Here the humor is a reason, but only\nagainst the background of a receptive audience; the background\nfunctions as an \u201cenabler\u201d. Finally, the fact that a funny\nremark will break an unduly somber mood may intensify the force of\nhumor as a reason. Humor itself is especially apt, but only because\nthe mood is unduly somber. Other factors could function as\nattenuators, weakening the force of a reason (see Dancy 2004: ch\n5).\n\nHolism depends crucially on the sustainability of the distinction\nbetween the particular considerations that count as reasons and the\ncontextual factors (defeaters, enablers, etc.) that impact whether a\nconsideration counts as a reason. Context-sensitivity without such a\ndistinction would be unable to explain why a feature which is a reason\nin one context can fail to be a reason in another. Moreover, we need\nto know why the relevant features should not be \u201choovered\nup\u201d into the content of the reasons themselves. After all,\natomists need not be simple atomists. A hedonist who held that\npleasure and pain are both always reasons and the only reasons, would\ncertainly count as an atomist. But atomists can allow for significant\npluralism and complexity. One way to do so is to insist that the\nconsiderations that a holist calls, variously, reasons, defeaters,\nenablers, and so on are all but parts of a larger more complex\n\u201cwhole\u201d reason. Such views have been proposed by Bennett\n(1995), Crisp (2000), Hooker (2003) and Raz (2000), and rejected by\nDancy (2004: 6.2). One worry about the atomists\u2019 appeal to whole\nreasons is that if reasons are identified with large complexes of\nfacts, then the same reason may seldom recur across cases and the\nclaim that agents act for reasons may fall under threat (Price\n2013).\n\nSetting aside whether holism is true, does it support particularism?\nGeneralists have rejected the inference on the grounds that holism\nleaves open the possibility that the behaviour of reasons, defeaters,\nenablers, and intensifiers/attenuators is codifiable (see\nV\u00e4yrynen 2004; McKeever and Ridge 2005). They also observe that\nsome paradigmatic generalists seem to have exploited this logical\nspace. For example, Kant arguably thinks that the fact that a course\nof action would advance someone\u2019s happiness is of variable moral\nsignificance, counting in favor whenever the happiness and its\npurchase is consistent with the categorical imperative and counting as\nno reason at all otherwise (McKeever and Ridge 2005). Particularists\nhave countered that even if holism is logically consistent with\nprinciples it would nevertheless render them \u201ccosmic\naccidents\u201d (Dancy 2004: 82). If this were right it would be\nenough to cast doubt on the generalist tradition in moral philosophy.\nWhy should the heart of a discipline be the search for cosmic\naccidents?! Generalists counter that whether principles are cosmic\naccidents depends entirely upon underlying metaphysical issues and not\non whether principles tolerate holism. For example, if the property of\nbeing good is identical to the property of being non-malicious\npleasure, then the associated holism tolerating principle does not\nlook to be a cosmic accident (see McKeever and Ridge 2006: 2.2).\n\nSelim Berker (2007) has challenged the particularist argument from\nholism in another way. He argues that the conjunction of holism with\nwhat he calls the particularist\u2019s\n\u201cnoncombinatorialism\u201d about the ways reasons combine to\nfix an overall verdict leaves the particularist with no coherent\nnotion of a reason for action. To understand noncombinatorialism, one\nmust first understand the idea of a \u201ccombinatorial\nfunction\u201d. A combinatorial function takes as input all the\nreasons and their valences in a given situation and gives the\nrightness or wrongness of actions in that situation as an output.\nNoncombinatorialism simply asserts that the combinatorial function for\nreasons cannot be finitely expressed (and so, in particular, is not\nadditive). Berker argues that particularists are committed to\nnoncombinatorialism, but that this leaves them with no coherent notion\nof a reason for action. Particularists typically gloss being a reason\nas \u201ccounting in favour\u201d of that for which the\nconsideration is a reason. Berker\u2019s point is that talk of a\nconsideration \u201ccounting in favour\u201d of something is itself\nhard to make intelligible once we abandon a combinatorial conception\nof how reasons combine to fix an overall verdict. We are left with a\nmetaphor that cannot be cashed out in any helpful way. Particularists\ncould of course abandon the noncombinatorial conception of reasons,\nbut Berker argues that this would commit them to the truth of numerous\nexceptionless principles, thus compromising their particularism. (For\ncritical discussion of Berker\u2019s argument, see Lechler 2012.)\n\nSo far we have focused on generalist replies to metaphysical arguments\nfor particularism. Generalists are not without positive metaphysical\narguments for their own views, though. Most notably, so-called\n\u201cconstitutivists\u201d sometimes invoke premises about the\nmetaphysics of rational agency to argue for generalism. Kantian\nconstitutivists are the most influential and clear-cut instance of\nthis style of argument. Christine Korsgaard, for example, argues that\nthe categorical imperative is constitutive of rational agency\n(Korsgaard 2008, 2009). The rough idea is that the principles of\npractical reasons unify us as agents, and allow us to take control\nover our representations of the world and our movements (Korsgaard\n2008: 9). Insofar as simply being a rational agent commits one to the\nrelevant principle(s), this strategy for defending generalism is also\nmeant to be especially effective at silencing sceptical challenges,\ne.g., classic \u201cwhy be moral?\u201d challenges. The thought is\nthat the sceptic has no coherent perspective from which to reject the\nrelevant principles.\n\nWhatever the success of these metaphysical arguments, some\nparticularists have worried that an excessive focus on metaphysics\nthreatens to lead us astray\u2014not to falsehood so much as\nmisplaced emphasis. The ontological status of moral laws and the\ngrounding of moral reasons ought not predominate the particularist\nprogram. Instead, the particularist should emphasize how their account\nof moral psychology makes sense of moral development and competence\n(see Bakhurst 2008, 2013).\n",
