Ethical Implications and Core Ethical Issues\n\n\nMost Internet users are well aware of the virtues of search engines.\nAs we noted earlier, many of us now depend on them to direct us to\ninformation that affects nearly all facets of our day-to-day\nlives\u2014information about work, travel, recreation, entertainment,\nfinances, politics, news, sports, music, education, and so\nforth. However, as we also noted earlier, the use of search engines\nhas generated a cluster of ethical concerns. In Section 3, we organize\nthese concerns into five broad categories: (i) search-engine bias and\nthe problem of opacity/non-transparency, (ii) personal privacy and\ninformed consent, (iii) monitoring and surveillance, (iv) censorship\nand democracy, (v) (cyber)security issues, \u201cdiscoverable search\nengines,\u201d and the Internet of Things. A different, but also\nrelated, cluster of ethical issues \u2014 viz, questions concerning\nmoral accountability and social responsibilities for search engine\ncompanies \u2014 are examined in Section 4.\n",
