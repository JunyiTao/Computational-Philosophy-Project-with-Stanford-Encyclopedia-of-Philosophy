    "main_text": "Modern Versions of the Church-Turing Thesis || The algorithmic version\n6.1 The algorithmic version\n\nIn modern computer science, algorithms and effective procedures are\nassociated not primarily with humans but with machines. Accordingly,\nmany computer science textbooks formulate the Church-Turing thesis\nwithout mentioning human computers (e.g., Hopcroft & Ullman 1979;\nLewis & Papadimitriou 1981). This is despite the fact that the\nconcept of human computation lay at the heart of Turing\u2019s and\nChurch\u2019s analyses.\n\nThe variety of algorithms studied by modern computer science eclipses\nthe field as it was in Turing\u2019s day. There are now parallel\nalgorithms, distributed algorithms, interactive algorithms, analog\nalgorithms, hybrid algorithms, quantum algorithms, enzymatic\nalgorithms, bacterial foraging algorithms, slime-mold algorithms and\nmore (see e.g., Gurevich 2012; Copeland & Shagrir 2019). The\nuniversal Turing machine cannot even perform the atomic steps of\nalgorithms carried out by, e.g., a parallel system where every cell\nupdates simultaneously (in contrast to the serial Turing machine), or\nan enzymatic system (where the atomic steps involve operations such as\nselective enzyme binding).\n\nNevertheless, the universal Turing machine is still able to\ncalculate the behavior of parallel systems and enzymematic\nsystems. The algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis\nstates that this is true of every algorithmic system. Thus\nLewis and Papadimitriou said: \u201cwe take the Turing machine to be\na precise formal equivalent of the intuitive notion of\n\u2018algorithm\u2019\u201d (1981: 223). David Harel gave the\nfollowing (famous) formulation of the algorithmic version of the\nthesis:\n\n\nany algorithmic problem for which we can find an algorithm that can be\nprogrammed in some programming language, any language,\n\u2026 is also solvable by a Turing machine. This statement is one\nversion of the so-called Church/Turing thesis. (Harel 1992: 233)\n\n\nGiven the extent to which the concept of an algorithm has evolved\nsince the 1930s\u2014from the step-by-step labors of human computers\nto the growth of slime mold\u2014interesting questions arise. Will\nthe concept continue to evolve? What are the limits, if any, on this\nevolution? Could the concept evolve in such that a way that the\nalgorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is no longer\nuniversally true? Returning to Doyle\u2019s suggestions about\nequilibrating systems (in\n Section 5.3.3),\n Doyle\u2019s claim is essentially that the operation of\nequilibrating could reasonably be regarded as a basic step of some\neffective procedures or algorithms\u2014whether or not the\nresulting algorithms satisfy the algorithmic version of the\nChurch-Turing thesis. (See Copeland & Shagrir 2019 for further\ndiscussion.)\n\nIn summary, the algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is\nbroader than the original thesis, in that Church and Turing considered\nessentially only a single type of algorithm, effective step-by-step\ncalculations on paper. The algorithmic version is also perhaps less\nsecure than the original thesis.\n",
