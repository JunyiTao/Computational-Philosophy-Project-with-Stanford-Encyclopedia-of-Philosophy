    "main_text": "Post-Quinean Strategies || Externalist Theories of Meaning\n4.2 Externalist Theories of Meaning\n\nDeveloping the strategy of \u00a73.3C above, Externalist theories of\nmeaning (or \u201ccontent\u201d) try to meet at least part of\nQuine\u2019s challenge by considering how matters of meaning need not\nrely on epistemic. or really any internal\nconnections among thoughts or beliefs, in the way that many\nphilosophers had traditionally supposed, but as involving largely\ncausal and social relations between uses of words and the phenomena in\nthe world that they pick out. This suggestion gradually emerged in the\nwork of Putnam (1962 [1975], 1965 [1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972\n[1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it took the form of positive\ntheories in, e.g., the work of Devitt (1981, 2015), Dretske (1988) and\nFodor (1990b), who tried to base meaning in various actual or\nco-variational causal relations between states of the mind/brain and\nexternal phenomena (see Indicator Semantics; as well as the\nwork on \u201cteleosemantics\u201d of Millikan, 1984), Papineau,\n1987, and Neander, 1995, 2017, who look to mechanisms of natural\nselection; see Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n\nConsider, for example, Fodor\u2019s proposal. Simplifying it\nslightly, Fodor (1990b) claimed that\n\n\na symbol S means p if\n\n(i)\nunder some conditions, C, it\u2019s a law that S\nis entokened iff p, and\n(ii)\nany other tokening of S synchronically depends upon (i),\nbut not vice versa.\n\n\n\nThus, tokenings of \u201chorse\u201d mean horse because\nthere are (say, optimal viewing) conditions under which tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d co-vary with horses, and tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d caused by cows asymmetrically depend upon that\nfact. The intuitive idea here is that what makes \u201chorse\u201d\nmean horse is that errors and other tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d in the absence of horses (e.g., dreaming of them)\ndepend upon being able to get things right, but not vice\nversa: getting things right doesn\u2019t depend upon getting\nthem wrong. The law in (i), so to say, \u201cgoverns\u201d the\ntokenings of (ii). (Note that this condition is metaphysical,\nappealing to actual laws of entokenings, and not upon\nasymmetric dependencies between epistemic criteria suggested\nby Fodor in his defense of Putnam we discussed in \u00a73.6.2.)\n\nFodor\u2019s and related proposals are not without their problems\n(see Loewer, 1996, Rey, 2009 and Causal Theories of Mental\nContent). Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth noting that,\nwere such theories to succeed in providing the kind of\nexplanatorily adequate, non-circular account of intentionality to\nwhich they aspire, they would go some way towards saving at least\nintentional psychology from Quine\u2019s attack, and provide at least\none prima facie plausible, naturalistic strategy for\ndistinguishing facts about meaning from facts about mere belief. The\nproposals, unlike those in the traditions of Carnap or of\nneo-Cartesians, have at least the form of a serious\nreply.\n\nHowever, even if such externalist strategies, either Fodor\u2019s or\nteleosemantic ones, were to save intentionality and meaning, they\nwould do so only by forsaking the high hopes we noted in \u00a72\nphilosophers harbored for the analytic. For externalists are typically\ncommitted to counting expressions as \u201csynonymous\u201d if they\nhappen to be linked in the right way to the same external phenomena,\neven if a thinker couldn\u2019t realize that they are by a\npriori (or, at any rate, \u201carmchair\u201d) reflection\nalone. By at least the Fregean substitution criterion (\u00a71.2),\nthey would seem to be committed to counting as \u201canalytic\u201d\nmany patently empirical sentences as \u201cWater is H2O,\u201d\n\u201cSalt is NaCl\u201d or \u201cMark Twain is Samuel\nClemens,\u201d since in each of these cases, something may co-vary in\nthe relevant way with tokenings of the expression on one side of the\nidentity if and only if it co-varies with tokenings of the one on the\nother (similar problems and others arise for teleosemantics; see Fodor\n1990b, pp. 72\u201373).\n\nOf course, along the lines of the worldly turn we noted in\n\u00a73.6.3, an externalist might cheerfully just allow that some\nsentences, e.g., \u201cwater is H20,\u201d are in fact analytic,\neven though they are \u201cexternal\u201d and subject to empirical\n(dis)confirmation. Such a view would actually comport well with an\nolder philosophical tradition less interested in the meanings of our\nwords and concepts, and more interested in the\n\u201cessences\u201d of the worldly phenomena they pick\nout. Locke (1690 [1975], II, 31, vi), for example, posited\n\u201creal\u201d essences of things rather along the lines\nresuscitated by Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1972 [1980]), the real\nessences being the conditions in the world independent of our thought\nthat make something the thing it is. Thus, being H2O may be\nwhat makes something water, and (to take the striking\nexamples of diseases noted by Putnam, 1962 [1975]) being the\nactivation of a certain virus is what makes something polio. But, of\ncourse, such an external view would still dash the hopes of\nphilosophers looking to the analytic to explain a priori\nknowledge (but see Bealer 1987 and Jackson 1998 for strategies to\nassimilate such empirical cases to nevertheless a priori,\narmchair analysis). Such a consequence, however, might not faze an\nexternalist like Fodor (1998), who is concerned only to save\nintentional psychology, and might otherwise share Quine\u2019s\nscepticism about the analytic and the a priori.\n\nTwo final problems, however, loom over any such externalist\nstrategies. One is how to provide content to\n\u201cresponse-dependent\u201d terms, such as\n\u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201camusing,\u201d \u201csexy,\u201d\n\u201cworrisome,\u201d whose extensions vary greatly with users and\noccasions. What seems crucial to the contents of such terms is not any\nexternalia that they might pick out, but simply some\ninternal reactions of thinkers that might vary among them\neven under all conditions, but without difference in meaning.\nAt any rate, there\u2019s no reason to suppose there\u2019s any sort\nof law that links the same phenomena to different people who find\ndifferent things \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d or\neven \u201cgreen\u201d (cf. Russell, 1912; Hardin, 2008). The other\nproblem is how to distinguish necessarily empty terms that\npurport to refer to (arguably) impossible phenomena such as perfectly\nflat surfaces, Euclidean figures, fictional characters or immortal\nsouls. An externalist would seem to be committed to treating all such\nterms as synonymous, despite, of course, the fact that thoughts about\nthem should obviously be distinguished (see Rey, 2009).\n",
