Philosophy of Language\n\nCook Wilson also questioned superficial uniformity of the form\n\u2018S is P\u2019, calling the subject of\nattributes \u2018metaphysical\u2019 (SI, 158) in order to\ndistinguish it from the subject of predication. He thus distinguished\nthe ontological distinction between substance and attribute\nfrom the logical subject-predicate distinction. Using the\ntraditional definition of the subject as \u2018what supports the\npredicate\u2019 and the predicate as \u2018what is said concerning\nthe subject\u2019 (quoting Boethius, SI, 114\u2013115), he noted\nthat a \u2018statement\u2019 such as \u2018That building is the\nBodleian\u2019 has different analyses, depending on the occasion in\nwhich it is used. If in answer to \u2018What building is\nthat?\u2019, with the \u2018stress accent\u2019 on \u2018the\nBodleian\u2019 as in \u2018That building is the\nBodleian\u2019, the subject is \u2018that building\u2019 and\nthe predicate as \u2018what is said concerning the subject\u2019 is\n\u2018that that building is the Bodleian\u2019 (SI, 117 & 158).\nBut, if in answer to the question \u2018Which building is the\nBodleian?\u2019 with the \u2018stress accent\u2019 now on\n\u2018that\u2019 as in \u2018That building is the\nBodleian\u2019, then the Bodleian is the subject and the predicate is\n\u2018that building pointed out was it\u2019 (SI, 119). The same\ngoes for \u2018glass is elastic\u2019, where elasticity is\npredicated of glass and \u2018glass is elastic\u2019, when\nit is stated in answer to someone looking for substances that are\nelastic. This shows that the relation of subject to predicate is\nsomehow symmetric, but it is not the case, however, with the\nsubject/attribute distinction because \u2018\u2018The subject cannot\nbe an attribute of one of its own attributes\u2019\u2019 (SI, 158).\nCook Wilson also noted that \u2018\u2018the stress accent is upon\nthe part of the sentence which conveys the new\ninformation\u2019\u2019 (SI, 118), and he would thus say that the\nsubject-predicate relation depends on the subjective order in\nwhich we apprehend them (SI, 139), while the relation between\n\u2018subject\u2019 and \u2018attribute\u2019 is objective\nin the sense that it is holding between a particular thing and a\n\u2018particularized quality\u2019, it is a \u2018\u2018relation\nbetween realities without reference to our apprehension of\nthem\u2019\u2019 (Robinson 1931, 103).\n\nIn \u2018How to Talk\u2019 (Austin 1979, 134\u2013153), Austin\nfurther developed distinctions akin to Cook Wilson\u2019s\ndifferentiation between the logical subject/predicate and metaphysical\nsubject/attribute distinctions, and this differentiation was shared by\nP. F. Strawson (Strawson 1959, 144), who also believed in\n\u2018particularized qualities\u2019 (Strawson (1959, 168) &\n(1974, 131)). In a bid to avoid Bradley\u2019s regress (Strawson\n1959, 167), he introduced the idea of \u2018non-relational\nties\u2019 between subject and attribute, leaving\n\u2018relations\u2019 for the link between logical subject and\npredicate. Some non-relational ties are thus said to hold between\nparticulars and particulars: to the relation between Socrates and the\nuniversal \u2018dying\u2019 corresponds an \u2018attributive\ntie\u2019 between the particulars that are both Socrates and\nthe event of his death. That such \u2018ties\u2019 are less obscure\nthan \u2018relations\u2019 and that this maneuver actually succeeds\nin stopping the regress are further issues, but it is interesting to\nnote that Strawson chose the name \u2018attributive tie\u2019 in\nhonour of Cook Wilson (Strawson (1959, 168), see SI, 193).\n\nStrawson also noted that Cook Wilson\u2019s argument for\ndifferentiating between the logical subject/predicate and metaphysical\nsubject/attribute distinctions involves an appeal to\n\u2018\u2018pragmatic considerations\u2019\u2019 (Strawson 1957,\n476). Cook Wilson\u2019s claim that a sentence such as \u2018glass\nis elastic\u2019 may state something different depending on the\noccasion in which it is used also had an important continuation in J.\nL. Austin\u2019s more general point that, although the meaning of\nwords plays a role in determining truth-conditions, it is not an\nexhaustive one: it \u201cdoes not fix for them a\ntruth-condition\u201d because that depends on how truth is to be\ndecided on the occasion of their use (see Travis (1996, 451) and\nKalderon & Travis (2013, 492 & 496)):\n\n\n\u2026 the question of truth and falsehood does not turn only on\nwhat a sentence is, nor yet on what it means, but\non, speaking very broadly, the circumstances in which it is uttered.\n(Austin 1962, 111)\n\n\nThis line of thought has been pursued further by Charles Travis under\nthe name of \u2018occasion-sensitivity\u2019, i.e.,\n\u2018\u2018the fact that the same state of the world may require\ndifferent answers on different occasions to the question of whether\nwhat was said in a given statement counts as true\u2019\u2019\n(Travis (1981, 147), see also (1989, 255)), this being a recurring\ntheme, see the papers collected in Part 1 of (Travis 2008)). Thus,\nCook Wilson\u2019s above examples, \u2018That building is the\nBodleian\u2019 or \u2018glass is elastic\u2019, are genealogically\nrelated to what are commonly known as \u2018Travis cases\u2019,\ni.e., sentences used to make a true statement about an item in one\noccasion and a false one about the same item in another. (For examples\nof these, see Travis (1989, 18\u201319), (1997, 89), (2008, 26 &\n111\u2013112).)\n\nR. G. Collingwood also took Cook Wilson as putting forth a slightly\ndifferent thesis, namely that the meaning of a statement is determined\nby the question to which it is an answer (Collingwood 1938, 265 n.).\nHe used this idea as the basis for his \u2018logic of questions and\nanswers\u2019 (Collingwood 2013, chap. 5) and for his theory of\npresuppositions (Collingwood 1998, chaps. 3\u20134), this last being\nfurther developed by the French linguist Oswald Ducrot (1980, 42f.).\nCollingwood was reluctant, however, to recognize Cook Wilson as an\ninspiration, since he thought ill of the idea of\n\u2018apprehensions\u2019 as a non-derivative basis for knowledge\nand he believed instead that knowledge comes from asking questions\nfirst (Collingwood 2013, 25), and thus that knowledge depends on a\n\u2018complex of questions and answers\u2019 (Collingwood 2013,\n37).\n",
