    "main_text": "The intelligibility of the new geometries || Herbart\u2019s philosophy and Riemann\n6.1 Herbart\u2019s philosophy and Riemann\n\nJohann Friedrich Herbart became Kant\u2019s successor in\nK\u00f6nigsberg in 1808, where he remained until going to\nG\u00f6ttingen in 1833, but he was no orthodox Kantian. His major\nwork, the two-volume Psychologie als Wissenschaft neu gegrundet\nauf Erfahrung, Metaphysik, und Mathematik of 1824\u20131825,\nsought to establish psychology as a science, based on experience and\nmetaphysics. Using some rather fanciful mathematics he endeavoured to\nshow how memory works and how repeated stimuli of certain kinds cause\nthe mind to learn to perceive, for example, lines, parallel lines,\nintersecting lines, and surfaces. There are no innate ideas, in\nHerbart\u2019s opinion; visual space is constructed from experience,\nmost significantly by means of the conceptual act of inferring\ncontinuity in spatial processes. And concepts are generated by\nclusters of memories, upon which logic then operates independently of\ntheir origins. This was Herbart\u2019s way of avoiding grounding\nlogic in psychology.\n\nHerbart\u2019s ideas influenced Riemann (see Scholz 1982). Riemann\nregarded natural science as the attempt to understand nature by the\nuse of precise concepts, which are to be modified in the light of new\nexperiences. He expected the most successful concepts to be quite\nabstract, and agreed with Herbart that they are not a priori in the\nKantian fashion. It was their origin in observation or experiment that\ngave these concepts their significance for science, but Riemann\nallowed for a constant process of corroboration and revision. In notes\nhe wrote for himself (see Riemann Werke 1990: 539) Riemann\nsaid that he agreed with Herbart in matters of psychology and\nepistemology, but not ontology or with his ideas about the\nconstruction of the concepts of space, time, and motion. The\ndisagreement masks a deeper sympathy. Herbart had advocated a\nthree-dimensional real world of causally connected but discrete\n'monads' (with windows, to use Leibniz's phrase), which the mind\ntreats via the concept of a continuum, which it supplies, thereby\nturning its discrete experiences into spectra of possibilities.\nRiemann saw no reason to restrict attention to three dimensions, and\nmoved the continuous spectra of possibilities into the very general\ngeometrical concepts he was creating.\n\nThis diminished the role of experience that Herbart had emphasised.\nRiemann was making conscious what Herbart had said occurred naturally:\nif intellectual reflection generates concepts with which we frame the\nworld, in reaction to our experiences, then, said Riemann, let\nmathematics generate more precise and flexible concepts with which to\nconduct science. At the end of his lecture he explored possibilities\nfor the application of the new geometries, especially at an atomic\nlevel, and he argued that his task had been to expand the range of\ntheoretical options, eliminating prejudices.\n",
