    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Revising the notion of a life worth living\n2.4 Revising the notion of a life worth living\n\nThe above discussion of the Repugnant Conclusion presumes that there\nare possible lives with a very high quality of life. However,\nChristoph Fehige (1998) and David Benatar (2006) have suggested that\nthere are no lives enjoying positive welfare. Benatar claims that it\nis always worse for a person to begin to exist than never to have\nexisted. According to Fehige, only frustrated preferences count, and\nthey count negatively, whereas satisfied preferences have no positive\nvalue. These \u201cSchopenhauerian\u201d theories imply that there\nare no possible lives with positive welfare. On the contrary, most\nlives have negative welfare and the best possible lives only have\nneutral welfare.\n\nWould the truth of such a theory of welfare make the Repugnant\nConclusion acceptable? Yes in a way, since it would neutralise the\nRepugnant Conclusion by making it an empty truth. If there are no\npossible lives with a very high quality of life, then the Repugnant\nConclusion is vacuously true, since the antecedent\u2014\u201c[f]or\nany possible population \u2026 with a very high quality of\nlife\u201d\u2014is false of every possible population. Consequently,\ntotal utilitarianism would only imply the Repugnant Conclusion in a\ntrivial and uninteresting sense.\n\nHowever, the logic of Benatar\u2019s theory has been challenged\n(Bradley 2010) and a theory of welfare that denies the possibility of\nlives worth living is quite counter-intuitive (Ryberg 1996a).\nFehige\u2019s theory, for example, implies that a life of one year\nwith complete preference satisfaction has the same welfare as a\ncompletely fulfilled life of a hundred years, and has higher welfare\nthan a life of a hundred years with all preferences but one satisfied.\nMoreover, the last life is not worth living.\n",
