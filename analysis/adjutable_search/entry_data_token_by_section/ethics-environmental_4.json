    "main_text": "Environmental Ethics and Politics || Disenchantment and the New Animism\n3.3 Disenchantment and the New Animism\n\nAn often overlooked source of ecological ideas is the work of the\nneo-Marxist Frankfurt School of critical theory founded by Max\nHorkheimer and Theodore Adorno (Horkheimer and Adorno 1969). While\nclassical Marxists regard nature as a resource to be transformed by\nhuman labour and utilized for human purposes, Horkheimer and Adorno\nsaw Marx himself as representative of the problem of \u201chuman\nalienation\u201d. At the root of this alienation, they argue, is a\nnarrow positivist conception of rationality\u2014which sees\nrationality as an instrument for pursuing progress, power and\ntechnological control, and takes observation, measurement and the\napplication of purely quantitative methods to be capable of solving\nall problems. Such a positivistic view of science combines determinism\nwith optimism. Natural processes as well as human activities are seen\nto be predictable and manipulable. Nature (and, likewise, human\nnature) is no longer mysterious, uncontrollable, or fearsome. Instead,\nit is reduced to an object strictly governed by natural laws, which\ntherefore can be studied, known, and employed to our benefit. By\npromising limitless knowledge and power, the positivism of science and\ntechnology not only removes our fear of nature, the critical theorists\nargue, but also destroys our sense of awe and wonder towards it. That\nis to say, positivism \u201cdisenchants\u201d nature\u2014along\nwith everything that can be studied by the sciences, whether natural,\nsocial or human.\n\nThe progress in knowledge and material well-being may not be a bad\nthing in itself, where the consumption and control of nature is a\nnecessary part of human life. However, the critical theorists argue\nthat the positivistic disenchantment of natural things (and, likewise,\nof human beings\u2014because they too can be studied and manipulated\nby science) disrupts our relationship with them, encouraging the\nundesirable attitude that they are nothing more than things to be\nprobed, consumed and dominated. According to the critical theorists,\nthe oppression of \u201couter nature\u201d (i.e., the natural\nenvironment) through science and technology is bought at a very high\nprice: the project of domination requires the suppression of our own\n\u201cinner nature\u201d (i.e., human nature)\u2014e.g., human\ncreativity, autonomy, and the manifold needs, vulnerabilities and\nlongings at the centre of human life. To remedy such an alienation,\nthe project of Horkheimer and Adorno is to replace the narrow\npositivistic and instrumentalist model of rationality with a more\nhumanistic one, in which the values of the aesthetic, moral, sensuous\nand expressive aspects of human life play a central part. Thus, their\naim is not to give up our rational faculties or powers of analysis and\nlogic. Rather, the ambition is to arrive at a dialectical synthesis\nbetween Romanticism and Enlightenment, to return to anti-deterministic\nvalues of freedom, spontaneity and creativity.\n\nIn his later work, Adorno advocates a re-enchanting aesthetic attitude\nof \u201csensuous immediacy\u201d towards nature. Not only do we\nstop seeing nature as primarily, or simply, an object of consumption,\nwe are also able to be directly and spontaneously acquainted with\nnature without interventions from our rational faculties. According to\nAdorno, works of art, like natural things, always involve an\n\u201cexcess\u201d, something more than their mere materiality and\nexchange value (see Vogel 1996, ch. 4.4 for a detailed discussion of\nAdorno\u2019s views on art, labour and domination). The\nre-enchantment of the world through aesthetic experience, he argues,\nis also at the same time a re-enchantment of human lives and purposes.\nAdorno\u2019s work remains largely unexplored in mainstream\nenvironmental philosophy, although the idea of applying critical\ntheory (embracing techniques of deconstruction, psychoanalysis and\nradical social criticism) to both environmental issues and the\nwritings of various ethical and political theorists has spawned the\nfield of \u201c\u00e9cocritique\u201d or\n\u201cecocriticism\u201d (Vogel 1996, Luke 1997, van Wyk 1997,\nDryzek 1997, Garrard 2014).\n\nSome students of Adorno\u2019s work have argued that his account of\nthe role of \u201csensuous immediacy\u201d can be understood as an\nattempt to defend a \u201clegitimate anthropomorphism\u201d that\ncomes close to a weak form of animism (Bernstein 2001, 196). Others,\nmore radical, have claimed to take inspiration from his notion of\n\u201cnon-identity\u201d, which, they argue, can be used as the\nbasis for a deconstruction of the notion of nature and perhaps even\nits elimination from ecocritical writing. For example, Timothy Morton\nargues that \u201cputting something called Nature on a pedestal and\nadmiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does\nfor the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic\nadmiration\u201d (Morton 2007, 5), and that \u201cin the name of all\nthat we value in the idea of \u2018nature\u2019, [ecocritique]\nthoroughly examines how nature is set up as a transcendental, unified,\nindependent category. Ecocritique does not think that it is\nparadoxical to say, in the name of ecology itself: \u2018down with\nnature!\u2019\u201d (ibid., 13). In this vein, some thinkers have\ninsisted that environmental ethics makes a mistake in drawing a\nsignificant distinction between the natural and the artificial (Vogel\n2015). Such an idea, however, has drawn fierce criticism from some\nMarxist theorists who argue that the \u201cend of nature\u201d\nthesis is deeply confused (for example Malm 2018). It remains to be\nseen, however, whether the radical attempt to purge the concept of\nnature from ecocritical work meets with success. Likewise, it is\nunclear whether the dialectic project on which Horkheimer and Adorno\nembarked is coherent, and whether Adorno, in particular, has a\nconsistent understanding of \u201cnature\u201d and\n\u201crationality\u201d (see Eckersley 1992 and Vogel 1996, for a\nreview of the Frankfurt School\u2019s thinking about nature, and on\nrationality see also the entry on\n critical theory).\n\nOn the other hand, the  new animists have been much inspired\nby the serious way in which some indigenous peoples placate and\ninteract with animals, plants and inanimate things through ritual,\nceremony and other practices (for examples see Kimmerer 2020).\nAccording to the new animists, the replacement of traditional animism\n(the view that personalized souls are found in animals, plants, and\nother material objects) by a form of disenchanting positivism directly\nleads to an anthropocentric perspective, which is accountable for much\nhuman destructiveness towards nature. In a disenchanted world, there\nis no meaningful order of things or events outside the human domain,\nand there is no source of sacredness or dread of the sort felt by\nthose who regard the natural world as peopled by divinities or demons\n(Stone 2006). When a forest is no longer sacred, there are no spirits\nto be placated and no mysterious risks associated with clear-felling\nit. A disenchanted nature is no longer alive. It commands no respect,\nreverence or love. It is nothing but a giant machine, to be mastered\nto serve human purposes. The new animists argue for reconceptualizing\nthe boundary between persons and non-persons. For them, \u201cliving\nnature\u201d comprises not only humans, animals and plants, but also\nmountains, forests, rivers, deserts, and even planets.\n\nWhether the notion that a mountain or a tree is to be regarded as a\nperson is taken literally or not, the attempt to engage with the\nsurrounding world as if it consists of other persons might possibly\nprovide the basis for a respectful attitude to nature (see Harvey 2005\nfor a popular account of the new animism). If disenchantment is a\nsource of environmental problems and destruction, then the new animism\ncan be regarded as attempting to re-enchant, and help to save, nature.\nMore poetically, David Abram has argued that a phenomenological\napproach of the kind taken by Merleau-Ponty can reveal to us that we\nare part of the \u201ccommon flesh\u201d of the world, that we are\nin a sense the world thinking itself (Abram 1995).\n\nIn her work, Freya Mathews has tried to articulate a version of\nanimism or panpsychism that captures ways in which the world (not just\nnature) contains many kinds of consciousness and sentience. For her,\nthere is an underlying unity of mind and matter in that the world is a\n\u201cself-realizing\u201d system containing a multiplicity of other\nsuch systems (cf. N\u00e6ss). According to Mathews, we are meshed in\ncommunication, and potential communication, with the \u201cOne\u201d\n(the greater cosmic self) and its many lesser selves (Mathews 2003,\n45\u201360). Materialism (the monistic theory that the world consists\npurely of matter), she argues, is self-defeating by encouraging a form\nof \u201ccollective solipsism\u201d that treats the world either as\nunknowable or as a social-construction (Mathews 2005, 12). Mathews\nalso takes inspiration from her interpretation of the core Daoist idea\nof  wuwei as \u201cletting be\u201d and bringing about\nchange through \u201ceffortless action\u201d. The focus in\nenvironmental management, development and commerce should be on\n\u201csynergy\u201d with what is already in place rather than on\ndemolition, replacement and disruption. Instead of bulldozing away old\nsuburbs and derelict factories, the synergistic panpsychist sees these\nartefacts as themselves part of the living cosmos, hence part of what\nis to be respected. Likewise, instead of trying to eliminate feral or\nexotic plants and animals, and restore environments to some imagined\npristine state, ways should be found\u2014wherever possible\u2014to\npromote synergies between the newcomers and the older native\npopulations in ways that maintain ecological flows and promote the\nfurther unfolding and developing of ecological processes (Mathews\n2004). Panpsychism, Mathews argues, frees us from the\n\u201cideological grid of capitalism\u201d, can reduce our desire\nfor consumer novelties, and can allow us and the world to grow old\ntogether with grace and dignity. Again, some of Mathews work echoes\nindigenous understandings of an enlarged subjectivity. As Deborah Rose\nputs it: \u201csubjectivity in the form of sentience and agency is\nnot solely a human prerogative but is located throughout other species\nand perhaps throughout country itself\u201d (Rose 2005, 302).\n\nIn summary, if disenchantment is a source of environmentally\ndestructive or uncaring attitudes, then both the aesthetic and the\nanimist/panpsychist re-enchantment of the world are intended to offer\nan antidote to such attitudes, and perhaps also inspirations for new\nforms of managing and designing for sustainability. The general\nproject of re-enchanting the world has surprising resonances with the\nviews of others who draw more explicitly on scientific understandings\nof life on earth. Earth systems science, for example, draws on the\nGaia hypothesis proposed by James Lovelock (Lovelock 1972,\n1979) suggesting that living things acting together regulate\nsignificant aspects of the global environment (Lovelock and Margulis\n1974). Later writers describe the Gaia hypothesis as conjecturing that\nsomething overlooked by previous scientific thinking was of vital\nimportance to understanding the one thing that supports all life on\nearth, namely a great stabilizing feedback system which regulates\nitself in a way that maintains the habitability of the planet (Lenton\net al. 2020). This feedback system is itself under threat\nfrom a changing climate, human overpopulation and reductions in\nbiodiversity (see further section 6 below and also Latour 2017). In\nplace of a vision of a grand cosmic self, champions of Gaia theory\nargue for recognizing the value of Life itself, where the capital \"L\"\ndraws attention to the great feedback system\u2014a single entity\ncomprising all the living things descended from the last universal\ncommon ancestor (Mariscal and Dolittle 2008).\n",
