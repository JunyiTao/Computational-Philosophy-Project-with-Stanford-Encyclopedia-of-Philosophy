The rigorous concept is that of a certain\nkind of algebra, analogous to the mathematical notion of a\ngroup. This concept has roots and applications in logic\n(Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras and model theory), set theory (fields of\nsets), topology (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces),\nfoundations of set theory (Boolean-valued models), measure theory\n(measure algebras), functional analysis (algebras of projections),\nand ring theory (Boolean rings).\u00a0 The study of Boolean algebras\nhas several aspects: structure theory, model theory of Boolean\nalgebras, decidability and undecidability questions for the class of\nBoolean algebras, and the indicated applications.

    "main_text": "\n1. Definition and simple properties\n\n\n A Boolean algebra (BA) is a set \\(A\\) together with binary\noperations + and \\(\\cdot\\) and a unary operation \\(-\\), and elements\n0, 1 of \\(A\\) such that the following laws hold: commutative and\nassociative laws for addition and multiplication, distributive laws\nboth for multiplication over addition and for addition over\nmultiplication, and the following special laws:\n \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx + (x \\cdot y) &= x \\\\\nx \\cdot(x + y) &= x \\\\\nx + (-x) &= 1 \\\\\nx \\cdot(-x) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n These laws are better understood in terms of the basic example of a\nBA, consisting of a collection \\(A\\) of subsets of a set \\(X\\) closed\nunder the operations of union, intersection, complementation with\nrespect to \\(X\\), with members \\(\\varnothing\\) and \\(X\\). One can\neasily derive many elementary laws from these axioms, keeping in mind\nthis example for motivation. Any BA has a natural partial order\n\\(\\le\\) defined upon it by saying that \\(x \\le y\\) if and only if \\(x\n+ y = y\\).  This corresponds in our main example to \\(\\subseteq\\). Of\nspecial importance is the two-element BA, formed by taking the set\n\\(X\\) to have just one element. The two-element BA shows the direct\nconnection with elementary logic. The two members, 0 and 1, correspond\nto falsity and truth respectively. The Boolean operations then express\nthe ordinary truth tables for disjunction (with \\(+)\\), conjunction\n(with \\(\\cdot)\\) and negation (with \\(-)\\). An important elementary\nresult is that an equation holds in all BAs if and only if it holds in\nthe two-element BA. Next, we define \\(x \\oplus y = (x \\cdot -y) + (y\n\\cdot -x)\\). Then \\(A\\) together with \\(\\oplus\\) and \\(\\cdot\\), along\nwith 0 and 1, forms a ring with identity in which every element is\nidempotent. Conversely, given such a ring, with addition \\(\\oplus\\)\nand multiplication, define \\(x + y = x \\oplus y \\oplus(x \\cdot y)\\)\nand \\(-x = 1 \\oplus x\\). This makes the ring into a BA. These two\nprocesses are inverses of one another, and show that the theory of\nBoolean algebras and of rings with identity in which every element is\nidempotent are definitionally equivalent. This puts the theory of BAs\ninto a standard object of research in algebra. An atom in a BA is a\nnonzero element \\(a\\) such that there is no element \\(b\\) with \\(0 \\lt\nb \\lt a\\). A BA is atomic if every nonzero element of the BA is above\nan atom. Finite BAs are atomic, but so are many infinite BAs. Under\nthe partial order \\(\\le\\) above, \\(x + y\\) is the least upper bound of\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and \\(x \\cdot y\\) is the greatest lower bound of\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We can generalize this: \\(\\Sigma X\\) is the least\nupper bound of a set \\(X\\) of elements, and \\(\\Pi X\\) is the greatest\nlower bound of a set \\(X\\) of elements. These do not exist for all\nsets in all Boolean algebras; if they do always exist, the Boolean\nalgebra is said to be complete.\n2. The elementary algebraic theory\n\n Several algebraic constructions have obvious definitions and simple\nproperties for BAs: subalgebras, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and\ndirect products (even of infinitely many algebras). Some other\nstandard algebraic constructions are more peculiar to BAs. An ideal in\na BA is a subset \\(I\\) closed under +, with 0 as a member, and such\nthat if \\(a \\le b \\in I\\), then also \\(a \\in I\\). Although not\nimmediately obvious, this is the same as the ring-theoretic\nconcept. There is a dual notion of a filter (with no counterpart in\nrings in general). A filter is a subset \\(F\\) closed under \\(\\cdot\\) ,\nhaving 1 as a member, and such that if \\(a \\ge b \\in F\\), then also\n\\(a \\in F\\). An ultrafilter on \\(A\\) is a filter \\(F\\) with the\nfollowing properties: \\(0 \\not\\in F\\), and for any \\(a \\in A\\), either\n\\(a \\in F\\) or \\(-a \\in F\\). For any \\(a \\in A\\), let\n\n\\[\nS(a)= \\{F : F \\text{ is an ultrafilter on } A \\text{ and } a \\in F\\}.\n\\]\n\n \n\nThen \\(S\\) is an isomorphism onto a BA of subsets of the set \\(X\\) of\nall ultrafilters on \\(A\\). This establishes the basic Stone\nrepresentation theorem, and clarifies the origin of BAs as concrete\nalgebras of sets. Moreover, the sets \\(S(a)\\) can be declared to be a\nbase for a topology on \\(X\\), and this turns \\(X\\) into a totally\ndisconnected compact Hausdorff space. This establishes a one-one\ncorrespondence between the class of BAs and the class of such\nspaces. As a consequence, used very much in the theory of BAs, many\ntopological theorems and concepts have consequences for BAs. If \\(x\\)\nis an element of a BA, we let \\(0x = -x\\) and \\(1x = x\\). If\n\\((x\\)(0), \\(\\ldots x(m - 1))\\) is a finite sequence of elements of a\nBA \\(A\\), then every element of the subalgebra of \\(A\\) generated by\n\\(\\{x(0), \\ldots, x(m - 1)\\}\\) can be written as a sum of monomials\n\\(e(0)x(0) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot e(m - 1)x(m - 1)\\) for \\(e\\) in some set\nof functions mapping \\(m = \\{0,\\ldots , m - 1\\}\\) into \\(2 = \\{0,\n1\\}\\). This is an algebraic expression of the disjunctive normal form\ntheorem of sentential logic. A function \\(f\\) from a set \\(X\\) of\ngenerators of a BA \\(A\\) into a BA \\(B\\) can be extended to a\nhomomorphism if and only if\n\n\\[\ne(0)x(0) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot e(m - 1)x(m - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n always implies that \n\n\\[e(0)f(x(0)) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot e(m - 1)f(x(m - 1)) = 0.\n\\]\n\n\nThis is Sikorski\u2019s extension criterion. Every BA \\(A\\) can be\nembedded in a complete BA \\(B\\) in such a way that every element of\n\\(B\\) is the least upper bound of a set of elements of \\(A\\). \\(B\\) is\nunique up to \\(A\\)-isomorphism, and is called the completion of\n\\(A\\). If \\(f\\) is a homomorphism from a BA \\(A\\) into a complete BA\n\\(B\\), and if \\(A\\) is a subalgebra of \\(C\\), then \\(f\\) can be\nextended to a homomorphism of \\(C\\) into \\(B\\). This is\nSikorski\u2019s extension theorem. Another general algebraic notion\nwhich applies to Boolean algebras is the notion of a free\nalgebra. This can be concretely constructed for BAs. Namely, the free\nBA on \\(\\kappa\\) is the BA of closed-open subsets of the two element\ndiscrete space raised to the \\(\\kappa\\) power.\n3. Special classes of Boolean algebras\n\n\n There are many special classes of Boolean algebra which are important\nboth for the intrinsic theory of BAs and for\napplications:\n\nAtomic BAs, already mentioned above.\nAtomless BAs, which are defined to be\nBAs without any atoms. For example, any infinite\nfree BA is atomless.\nComplete BAs, defined above. These are specially\nimportant in the foundations of set theory.\nInterval algebras. These are derived from linearly ordered sets\n\\((L, \\lt)\\) with a first element as follows. One takes the smallest\n algebra of subsets of \\(L\\) containing all of the half-open\nintervals [\\(a, b)\\) with \\(a\\) in \\(L\\) and\n\\(b\\) in \\(L\\) or equal to \\(\\infty\\). These BAs are useful in\nthe study of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras. Every countable BA is\nisomorphic to an interval algebra, and thus a countable BA can be\ndescribed by indicating an ordered set such that it is isomorphic to\nthe corresponding interval algebra.\nTree algebras. A tree is a partially ordered set \\((T, \\lt)\\) in\nwhich the set of predecessors of any element is well-ordered.  Given\nsuch a tree, one considers the algebra of subsets of \\(T\\) generated\nby all sets of the form \\(\\{b : a \\le b\\}\\) for some \\(a\\) in\n\\(T\\).\nSuperatomic BAs. These are BAs\nwhich are not only atomic, but are such that each subalgebra and\nhomomorphic image is atomic.\n\n4. Structure theory and cardinal functions on Boolean algebras\n\n\n Much of the deeper theory of Boolean algebras, telling about their\nstructure and classification, can be formulated in terms of certain\nfunctions defined for all Boolean algebras, with infinite cardinals\nas values. We define some of the more important of these cardinal\nfunctions, and state some of the known structural facts, mostly\nformulated in terms of them\n\nThe cellularity \\(c(A)\\) of a BA is the supremum of\nthe cardinalities of sets of pairwise disjoint elements of \\(A\\).\n\nA subset \\(X\\) of a BA \\(A\\) is independent if\n\\(X\\) is a set of free generators of the subalgebra that it\ngenerates. The independence of \\(A\\) is the supremum of\ncardinalities of independent subsets of \\(A\\).\nA subset \\(X\\) of a BA \\(A\\) is dense in \\(A\\) if\nevery nonzero element of \\(A\\) is \\(\\ge\\) a nonzero element of\n\\(X\\). The \\(\\pi\\)-weight of \\(A\\) is the smallest cardinality\nof a dense subset of \\(A\\).\nTwo elements \\(x, y\\) of \\(A\\) are incomparable\nif neither one is \\(\\le\\) the other. The supremum of cardinalities of\nsubset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\) consisting of pairwise incomparable\nelements is the incomparability of \\(A\\).\nA subset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\) is irredundant if no element of\n\\(X\\) is in the subalgebra generated by the others.\n\n\n An important fact concerning cellularity is the Erd\u0151s-Tarski\ntheorem: if the cellularity of a BA is a singular cardinal, then there\nactually is a set of disjoint elements of that size; for cellularity\nregular limit (inaccessible), there are counterexamples. Every\ninfinite complete BA has an independent subset of the same size as the\nalgebra. Every infinite BA \\(A\\) has an irredundant incomparable\nsubset whose size is the \\(\\pi\\)-weight of \\(A\\). Every interval\nalgebra has countable independence. A superatomic algebra does not\neven have an infinite independent subset. Every tree algebra can be\nembedded in an interval algebra. A BA with only the identity\nautomorphism is called rigid. There exist rigid complete BAs, also\nrigid interval algebras and rigid tree algebras. \n\nMore recently, many cardinal functions of min-max type have been\nstudied. For example, small independence is the smallest size of an\ninfinite maximal independent set; and small cellularity is the\nsmallest size of an infinite partition of unity.\n5. Decidability and undecidability questions\n\n\n A basic result of Tarski is that the elementary theory of Boolean\nalgebras is decidable. Even the theory of Boolean algebras with a\ndistinguished ideal is decidable. On the other hand, the theory of a\nBoolean algebra with a distinguished subalgebra is undecidable. Both\nthe decidability results and undecidablity results extend in various\nways to Boolean algebras in extensions of first-order logic.\n6. Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras\n\n\n A very important construction, which carries over to many logics and\nmany algebras other than Boolean algebras, is the construction of a\nBoolean algebra associated with the sentences in some logic. The\nsimplest case is sentential logic. Here there are sentence symbols,\nand common connectives building up longer sentences from them:\ndisjunction, conjunction, and negation. Given a set \\(A\\) of sentences\nin this language, two sentences \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are equivalent modulo\n\\(A\\) if and only if the biconditional between them is a logical\nconsequence of \\(A\\). The equivalence classes can be made into a BA\nsuch that + corresponds to disjunction, \\(\\cdot\\) to conjunction, and\n\\(-\\) to negation. Any BA is isomorphic to one of this form. One can\ndo something similar for a first-order theory. Let \\(T\\) be a\nfirst-order theory in a first-order language \\(L\\). We call formulas\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) equivalent provided that \\(T \\vdash \\phi\n\\leftrightarrow \\psi\\).  The equivalence class of a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nis denoted by [\\(\\phi\\)]. Let \\(A\\) be the collection of all\nequivalence classes under this equivalence relation. We can make \\(A\\)\ninto a BA by the following definitions, which are easily\njustified:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n[\\phi] + [\\psi] &= [\\phi \\vee \\psi] \\\\\n[\\phi] \\cdot[\\psi] &= [\\phi \\wedge \\psi] \\\\\n-[\\phi] &= [\\neg \\phi] \\\\\n0 &= [\\mathrm{F}] \\\\\n1 &= [\\mathrm{T}]\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n Every BA is isomorphic to a Lindenbaum-Tarski\nalgebra. However, one of the most important uses of these classical\nLindenbaum-Tarski algebras is to describe them for important theories\n(usually decidable theories). For countable languages this can be\ndone by describing their isomorphic interval algebras. Generally this\ngives a thorough knowledge of the theory. Some examples are:\n\n\n\nTheory\nIsomorphic to interval algebra on\n\n\n(1)\nessentially undecidable theory\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), the rationals\n\n\n(2)\nBAs\n\\(\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}\\),\n square of the positive integers, ordered lexicographically\n\n\n(3)\nlinear orders\n\\(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbb{Q}\\) ordered antilexicographically,\n where \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{N}^\\mathbb{N}\\)\n in its usual order\n\n\n(4)\nabelian groups\n\\((\\mathbb{Q} + \\mathbf{A}) \\times \\mathbb{Q}\\)\n\n\n7. Boolean-valued models\n\n\n In model theory, one can take values in any complete BA rather than\nthe two-element BA. This Boolean-valued model theory was developed\naround 1950\u20131970, but has not been worked on much since. But a\nspecial case, Boolean-valued models for set theory, is very much at\nthe forefront of current research in set theory. It actually forms an\nequivalent way of looking at the forcing construction of Cohen, and\nhas some technical advantages and disadvantages. Philosophically it\nseems more satisfactory than the forcing concept. We describe this\nset theory case here; it will then become evident why only complete\nBAs are considered. Let B be a complete BA. First we define the\nBoolean valued universe \\(V(B)\\). The ordinary\nset-theoretic universe can be identified with \\(V\\)(2), where 2\nis the 2-element BA. The definition is by transfinite recursion, where\n\\(\\alpha , \\beta\\) are ordinals and \\(\\lambda\\) is a limit ordinal:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nV(B, 0) &= \\varnothing \\\\\nV(B, \\alpha + 1) &= \\{ f : \\dom(f) \\subset V(B, \\alpha) \n     \\text{ and } \\range(f) \\subset B \\} \\\\\nV(B, \\lambda) &= \\bigcup_{\\beta \\lt \\lambda} V(B, \\beta).\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(\\dom(f)\\) is the domain of function \\(f\\) and \\(\\range(f)\\) is\nthe range of function \\(f\\). The \\(B\\)-valued universe is the proper\nclass \\(V(B)\\) which is the union of all of these \\(V\\)s. Next, one\ndefines by a rather complicated transfinite recursion over\nwell-founded sets the value of a set-theoretic formula with elements\nof the Boolean valued universe assigned to its free variables:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\val{x \\in y} &= \\sum_{t \\in \\dom(y)} \\val{x=t}\\cdot y(t) \\\\\n\\val{x \\subseteq y} &= \\prod_{t \\in \\dom(x)} -x(t) + \\val{t \\in y} \\\\\n\\val{x = y} &= \\val{x \\subseteq y} \\cdot \\val{y \\subseteq x} \\\\\n\\val{\\neg \\phi} &= -\\val{\\phi} \\\\\n\\val{\\phi \\vee \\psi} &=  \\val{\\phi} + \\val{\\psi} \\\\\n\\val{\\exists x\\phi(x)} &= \\sum_{a \\in V(B)} \\val{\\phi(a)}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n",
