    "main_text": "Objectivity and Subjectivity\n1. Objectivity and Subjectivity\n\nPerhaps the most familiar basic issue in the theory of beauty is\nwhether beauty is subjective\u2014located \u2018in the eye of the\nbeholder\u2019\u2014or rather an objective feature of beautiful\nthings. A pure version of either of these positions seems implausible,\nfor reasons we will examine, and many attempts have been made to split\nthe difference or incorporate insights of both subjectivist and\nobjectivist accounts. Ancient and medieval accounts for the most part\nlocated beauty outside of anyone\u2019s particular experiences.\nNevertheless, that beauty is subjective was also a commonplace from\nthe time of the sophists. By the eighteenth century, Hume could write\nas follows, expressing one \u2018species of philosophy\u2019:\n\n\nBeauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the\nmind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different\nbeauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is\nsensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own\nsentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757,\n136)\n\n\nAnd Kant launches his discussion of the matter in The Critique of\nJudgment (the Third Critique) at least as emphatically:\n\n\nThe judgment of taste is therefore not a judgment of cognition, and is\nconsequently not logical but aesthetical, by which we understand that\nwhose determining ground can be no other than subjective.\nEvery reference of representations, even that of sensations, may be\nobjective (and then it signifies the real [element] of an empirical\nrepresentation), save only the reference to the feeling of pleasure\nand pain, by which nothing in the object is signified, but through\nwhich there is a feeling in the subject as it is affected by the\nrepresentation. (Kant 1790, section 1)\n\n\nHowever, if beauty is entirely subjective\u2014that is, if anything\nthat anyone holds to be or experiences as beautiful is beautiful (as\nJames Kirwan, for example, asserts)\u2014then it seems that the word\nhas no meaning, or that we are not communicating anything when we call\nsomething beautiful except perhaps an approving personal attitude. In\naddition, though different persons can of course differ in particular\njudgments, it is also obvious that our judgments coincide to a\nremarkable extent: it would be odd or perverse for any person to deny\nthat a perfect rose or a dramatic sunset was beautiful. And it is\npossible actually to disagree and argue about whether something is\nbeautiful, or to try to show someone that something is beautiful, or\nlearn from someone else why it is.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems senseless to say that beauty has no\nconnection to subjective response or that it is entirely objective.\nThat would seem to entail, for example, that a world with no\nperceivers could be beautiful or ugly, or perhaps that beauty could be\ndetected by scientific instruments. Even if it could be, beauty would\nseem to be connected to subjective response, and though we may argue\nabout whether something is beautiful, the idea that one\u2019s\nexperiences of beauty might be disqualified as simply inaccurate or\nfalse might arouse puzzlement as well as hostility. We often regard\nother people\u2019s taste, even when it differs from our own, as\nprovisionally entitled to some respect, as we may not, for example, in\ncases of moral, political, or factual opinions. All plausible accounts\nof beauty connect it to a pleasurable or profound or loving response,\neven if they do not locate beauty purely in the eye of the\nbeholder.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, most philosophical accounts of beauty\ntreated it as an objective quality: they located it in the beautiful\nobject itself or in the qualities of that object. In De Veritate\nReligione, Augustine asks explicitly whether things are beautiful\nbecause they give delight, or whether they give delight because they\nare beautiful; he emphatically opts for the second (Augustine, 247).\nPlato\u2019s account in the Symposium and Plotinus\u2019s\nin the Enneads connect beauty to a response of love and\ndesire, but locate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms, and the\nbeauty of particular objects in their participation in the Form.\nIndeed, Plotinus\u2019s account in one of its moments makes beauty a\nmatter of what we might term \u2018formedness\u2019: having the\ndefinite shape characteristic of the kind of thing the object is.\n\n\nWe hold that all the loveliness of this world comes by communion in\nIdeal-Form. All shapelessness whose kind admits of pattern and form,\nas long as it remains outside of Reason and Idea, is ugly from that\nvery isolation from the Divine-Thought. And this is the Absolute Ugly:\nan ugly thing is something that has not been entirely mastered by\npattern, that is by Reason, the Matter not yielding at all points and\nin all respects to Ideal-Form. But where the Ideal-Form has entered,\nit has grouped and coordinated what from a diversity of parts was to\nbecome a unity: it has rallied confusion into co-operation: it has\nmade the sum one harmonious coherence: for the Idea is a unity and\nwhat it moulds must come into unity as far as multiplicity may.\n(Plotinus, 22 [Ennead I, 6])\n\n\nIn this account, beauty is at least as objective as any other concept,\nor indeed takes on a certain ontological priority as more real than\nparticular Forms: it is a sort of Form of Forms.\n\nThough Plato and Aristotle disagree on what beauty is, they both\nregard it as objective in the sense that it is not localized in the\nresponse of the beholder. The classical conception\n (see below)\n treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions or\nrelations among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, for\nexample the \u2018golden section.\u2019 The sculpture known as\n\u2018The Canon,\u2019 by Polykleitos (fifth/fourth century BCE),\nwas held up as a model of harmonious proportion to be emulated by\nstudents and masters alike: beauty could be reliably achieved by\nreproducing its objective proportions. Nevertheless, it is\nconventional in ancient treatments of the topic also to pay tribute to\nthe pleasures of beauty, often described in quite ecstatic terms, as\nin Plotinus: \u201cThis is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce:\nwonderment and a delicious trouble, longing and love and a trembling\nthat is all delight\u201d (Plotinus 23, [Ennead I, 3]).\n\nAt latest by the eighteenth century, however, and particularly in the\nBritish Isles, beauty was associated with pleasure in a somewhat\ndifferent way: pleasure was held to be not the effect but the origin\nof beauty. This was influenced, for example, by Locke\u2019s\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities. Locke and the\nother empiricists treated color (which is certainly one source or\nlocus of beauty), for example, as a \u2018phantasm\u2019 of the\nmind, as a set of qualities dependent on subjective response, located\nin the perceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind.\nWithout perceivers of a certain sort, there would be no colors. One\nargument for this was the variation in color experiences between\npeople. For example, some people are color-blind, and to a person with\njaundice much of the world allegedly takes on a yellow cast. In\naddition, the same object is perceived as having different colors by\nthe same the person under different conditions: at noon and midnight,\nfor example. Such variations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty\nas well.\n\nNevertheless, eighteenth-century philosophers such as Hume and Kant\nperceived that something important was lost when beauty was treated\nmerely as a subjective state. They saw, for example, that\ncontroversies often arise about the beauty of particular things, such\nas works of art and literature, and that in such controversies,\nreasons can sometimes be given and will sometimes be found convincing.\nThey saw, as well, that if beauty is completely relative to individual\nexperiencers, it ceases to be a paramount value, or even recognizable\nas a value at all across persons or societies.\n\nHume\u2019s \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d and Kant\u2019s\nCritique Of Judgment attempt to find ways through what has\nbeen termed \u2018the antinomy of taste.\u2019 Taste is proverbially\nsubjective: de gustibus non est disputandum (about taste\nthere is no disputing). On the other hand, we do frequently dispute\nabout matters of taste, and some persons are held up as exemplars of\ngood taste or of tastelessness. Some people\u2019s tastes appear\nvulgar or ostentatious, for example. Some people\u2019s taste is too\nexquisitely refined, while that of others is crude, naive, or\nnon-existent. Taste, that is, appears to be both subjective and\nobjective: that is the antinomy.\n\nBoth Hume and Kant, as we have seen, begin by acknowledging that taste\nor the ability to detect or experience beauty is fundamentally\nsubjective, that there is no standard of taste in the sense that the\nCanon was held to be, that if people did not experience\ncertain kinds of pleasure, there would be no beauty. Both acknowledge\nthat reasons can count, however, and that some tastes are better than\nothers. In different ways, they both treat judgments of beauty neither\nprecisely as purely subjective nor precisely as objective but, as we\nmight put it, as inter-subjective or as having a social and cultural\naspect, or as conceptually entailing an inter-subjective claim to\nvalidity.\n\nHume\u2019s account focuses on the history and condition of the\nobserver as he or she makes the judgment of taste. Our practices with\nregard to assessing people\u2019s taste entail that judgments of\ntaste that reflect idiosyncratic bias, ignorance, or superficiality\nare not as good as judgments that reflect wide-ranging acquaintance\nwith various objects of judgment and are unaffected by arbitrary\nprejudices. Hume moves from considering what makes a thing beautiful\nto what makes a critic credible. \u201cStrong sense, united to\ndelicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and\ncleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable\ncharacter; and the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found,\nis the true standard of taste and beauty\u201d (\u201cOf the\nStandard of Taste\u201d 1757, 144).\n\nHume argues further that the verdicts of critics who possess those\nqualities tend to coincide, and approach unanimity in the long run,\nwhich accounts, for example, for the enduring veneration of the works\nof Homer or Milton. So the test of time, as assessed by the verdicts\nof the best critics, functions as something analogous to an objective\nstandard. Though judgments of taste remain fundamentally subjective,\nand though certain contemporary works or objects may appear\nirremediably controversial, the long-run consensus of people who are\nin a good position to judge functions analogously to an objective\nstandard and renders such standards unnecessary even if they could be\nidentified. Though we cannot directly find a standard of beauty that\nsets out the qualities that a thing must possess in order to be\nbeautiful, we can describe the qualities of a good critic or a\ntasteful person. Then the long-run consensus of such persons is the\npractical standard of taste and the means of justifying judgments\nabout beauty.\n\nKant similarly concedes that taste is fundamentally subjective, that\nevery judgment of beauty is based on a personal experience, and that\nsuch judgments vary from person to person.\n\n\nBy a principle of taste I mean a principle under the condition of\nwhich we could subsume the concept of the object, and thus infer, by\nmeans of a syllogism, that the object is beautiful. But that is\nabsolutely impossible. For I must immediately feel the pleasure in the\nrepresentation of the object, and of that I can be persuaded by no\ngrounds of proof whatever. Although, as Hume says, all critics can\nreason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same fate awaits them. They\ncannot expect the determining ground of their judgment [to be derived]\nfrom the force of the proofs, but only from the reflection of the\nsubject upon its own proper state of pleasure or pain. (Kant 1790,\nsection 34)\n\n\nBut the claim that something is beautiful has more content merely than\nthat it gives me pleasure. Something might please me for reasons\nentirely eccentric to myself: I might enjoy a bittersweet experience\nbefore a portrait of my grandmother, for example, or the architecture\nof a house might remind me of where I grew up. \u201cNo one cares\nabout that,\u201d says Kant (1790, section 7): no one begrudges me\nsuch experiences, but they make no claim to guide or correspond to the\nexperiences of others.\n\nBy contrast, the judgment that something is beautiful, Kant argues, is\na disinterested judgment. It does not respond to my\nidiosyncrasies, or at any rate if I am aware that it does, I will no\nlonger take myself to be experiencing the beauty per se of the thing\nin question. Somewhat as in Hume\u2014whose treatment Kant evidently\nhad in mind\u2014one must be unprejudiced to come to a genuine\njudgment of taste, and Kant gives that idea a very elaborate\ninterpretation: the judgment must be made independently of the normal\nrange of human desires\u2014economic and sexual desires, for\ninstance, which are examples of our \u2018interests\u2019 in this\nsense. If one is walking through a museum and admiring the paintings\nbecause they would be extremely expensive were they to come up for\nauction, for example, or wondering whether one could steal and fence\nthem, one is not having an experience of the beauty of the paintings\nat all. One must focus on the form of the mental representation of the\nobject for its own sake, as it is in itself. Kant summarizes this as\nthe thought that insofar as one is having an experience of the beauty\nof something, one is indifferent to its existence. One takes pleasure,\nrather, in its sheer representation in one\u2019s experience:\n\n\nNow, when the question is whether something is beautiful, we do not\nwant to know whether anything depends or can depend on the existence\nof the thing, either for myself or anyone else, but how we judge it by\nmere observation (intuition or reflection). \u2026 We easily see\nthat, in saying it is beautiful, and in showing that I have\ntaste, I am concerned, not with that in which I depend on the\nexistence of the object, but with that which I make out of this\nrepresentation in myself. Everyone must admit that a judgement about\nbeauty, in which the least interest mingles, is very partial and is\nnot a pure judgement of taste. (Kant 1790, section 2)\n\n\nOne important source of the concept of aesthetic disinterestedness is\nthe Third Earl of Shaftesbury\u2019s dialogue The Moralists,\nwhere the argument is framed in terms of a natural landscape: if you\nare looking at a beautiful valley primarily as a valuable real estate\nopportunity, you are not seeing it for its own sake, and cannot fully\nexperience its beauty. If you are looking at a lovely woman and\nconsidering her as a possible sexual conquest, you are not able to\nexperience her beauty in the fullest or purest sense; you are\ndistracted from the form as represented in your experience. And\nShaftesbury, too, localizes beauty to the representational capacity of\nthe mind. (Shaftesbury 1738, 222)\n\nFor Kant, some beauties are dependent\u2014relative to the sort of\nthing the object is\u2014and others are free or absolute. A beautiful\nox would be an ugly horse, but abstract textile designs, for example,\nmay be beautiful without a reference group or \u201cconcept,\u201d\nand flowers please whether or not we connect them to their practical\npurposes or functions in plant reproduction (Kant 1790, section 16).\nThe idea in particular that free beauty is completely separated from\npractical use and that the experiencer of it is not concerned with the\nactual existence of the object leads Kant to conclude that absolute or\nfree beauty is found in the form or design of the\nobject, or as Clive Bell (1914) put it, in the arrangement of lines\nand colors (in the case of painting). By the time Bell writes in the\nearly twentieth century, however, beauty is out of fashion in the\narts, and Bell frames his view not in terms of beauty but in terms of\na general formalist conception of aesthetic value.\n\nSince in reaching a genuine judgment of taste one is aware that one is\nnot responding to anything idiosyncratic in oneself, Kant asserts\n(1790, section 8), one will reach the conclusion that anyone similarly\nsituated should have the same experience: that is, one will presume\nthat there ought to be nothing to distinguish one person\u2019s\njudgment from another\u2019s (though in fact there may be). Built\nconceptually into the judgment of taste is the assertion that anyone\nsimilarly situated ought to have the same experience and reach the\nsame judgment. Thus, built into judgments of taste is a\n\u2018universalization\u2019 somewhat analogous to the\nuniversalization that Kant associates with ethical judgments. In\nethical judgments, however, the universalization is objective: if the\njudgment is true, then it is objectively the case that everyone ought\nto act on the maxim according to which one acts. In the case of\naesthetic judgments, however, the judgment remains subjective, but\nnecessarily contains the \u2018demand\u2019 that everyone should\nreach the same judgment. The judgment conceptually entails a claim to\ninter-subjective validity. This accounts for the fact that we do very\noften argue about judgments of taste, and that we find tastes that are\ndifferent than our own defective.\n\nThe influence of this series of thoughts on philosophical aesthetics\nhas been immense. One might mention related approaches taken by such\nfigures as Schopenhauer (1818), Hanslick (1891), Bullough (1912), and\nCroce (1928), for example. A somewhat similar though more adamantly\nsubjectivist line is taken by Santayana, who defines beauty as\n\u2018objectified pleasure.\u2019 The judgment of something that it\nis beautiful responds to the fact that it induces a certain sort of\npleasure; but this pleasure is attributed to the object, as though the\nobject itself were having subjective states.\n\n\nWe have now reached our definition of beauty, which, in the terms of\nour successive analysis and narrowing of the conception, is value\npositive, intrinsic, and objectified. Or, in less technical language,\nBeauty is pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing. \u2026 Beauty\nis a value, that is, it is not a perception of a matter of fact or of\na relation: it is an emotion, an affection of our volitional and\nappreciative nature. An object cannot be beautiful if it can give\npleasure to nobody: a beauty to which all men were forever indifferent\nis a contradiction in terms. \u2026 Beauty is therefore a positive\nvalue that is intrinsic; it is a pleasure. (Santayana 1896,\n50\u201351)\n\n\nIt is much as though one were attributing malice to a balky object or\ndevice. The object causes certain frustrations and is then ascribed an\nagency or a kind of subjective agenda that would account for its\ncausing those effects. Now though Santayana thought the experience of\nbeauty could be profound or could even be the meaning of life, this\naccount appears to make beauty a sort of mistake: one attributes\nsubjective states (indeed, one\u2019s own) to a thing which in many\ninstances is not capable of having subjective states.\n\nIt is worth saying that Santayana\u2019s treatment of the topic in\nThe Sense of Beauty (1896) was the last major account offered\nin English for some time, possibly because, once beauty has been\nadmitted to be entirely subjective, much less when it is held to rest\non a sort of mistake, there seems little more to be said. What stuck\nfrom Hume\u2019s and Kant\u2019s treatments was the subjectivity,\nnot the heroic attempts to temper it. If beauty is a subjective\npleasure, it would seem to have no higher status than anything that\nentertains, amuses, or distracts; it seems odd or ridiculous to regard\nit as being comparable in importance to truth or justice, for example.\nAnd the twentieth century also abandoned beauty as the dominant goal\nof the arts, again in part because its trivialization in theory led\nartists to believe that they ought to pursue more urgent and more\nserious projects. More significantly, as we will see below, the\npolitical and economic associations of beauty with power tended to\ndiscredit the whole concept for much of the twentieth century. This\ndecline is explored eloquently in Arthur Danto\u2019s book The\nAbuse of Beauty (2003).\n\nHowever, there was a revival of interest in beauty in something like\nthe classical philosophical sense in both art and philosophy beginning\nin the 1990s, to some extent centered on the work of art critic Dave\nHickey, who declared that \u201cthe issue of the 90s will be\nbeauty\u201d (see Hickey 1993), as well as feminist-oriented\nreconstruals or reappropriations of the concept (see Brand 2000,\nIrigaray 1993). Several theorists made new attempts to address the\nantinomy of taste. To some extent, such approaches echo\nG.E. Moore\u2019s: \u201cTo say that a thing is beautiful is to say,\nnot indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a necessary element\nin something which is: to prove that a thing is truly beautiful is to\nprove that a whole, to which it bears a particular relation as a part,\nis truly good\u201d (Moore 1903, 201).  One interpretation of this\nwould be that what is fundamentally valuable is the situation in which\nthe object and the person experiencing are both embedded; the value of\nbeauty might include both features of the beautiful object and the\npleasures of the experiencer.\n\nSimilarly, Crispin Sartwell in his book Six Names of Beauty\n(2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the subject nor to\nthe object, but to the relation between them, and even more widely\nalso to the situation or environment in which they are both embedded.\nHe points out that when we attribute beauty to the night sky, for\ninstance, we do not take ourselves simply to be reporting a state of\npleasure in ourselves; we are turned outward toward it; we are\ncelebrating the real world. On the other hand, if there were no\nperceivers capable of experiencing such things, there would be no\nbeauty. Beauty, rather, emerges in situations in which subject and\nobject are juxtaposed and connected.\n\nAlexander Nehamas, in Only a Promise of Happiness (2007),\ncharacterizes beauty as an invitation to further experiences, a way\nthat things invite us in, while also possibly fending us off. The\nbeautiful object invites us to explore and interpret, but it also\nrequires us to explore and interpret: beauty is not to be regarded as\nan instantaneously apprehensible feature of surface. And Nehamas, like\nHume and Kant, though in another register, considers beauty to have an\nirreducibly social dimension. Beauty is something we share, or\nsomething we want to share, and shared experiences of beauty are\nparticularly intense forms of communication. Thus, the experience of\nbeauty is not primarily within the skull of the experiencer, but\nconnects observers and objects such as works of art and literature in\ncommunities of appreciation.\n\n\nAesthetic judgment, I believe, never commands universal agreement, and\nneither a beautiful object nor a work of art ever engages a catholic\ncommunity. Beauty creates smaller societies, no less important or\nserious because they are partial, and, from the point of view of its\nmembers, each one is orthodox\u2014orthodox, however, without\nthinking of all others as heresies. \u2026 What is involved is less\na matter of understanding and more a matter of hope, of\nestablishing a community that centers around it\u2014a\ncommunity, to be sure, whose boundaries are constantly shifting and\nwhose edges are never stable.
