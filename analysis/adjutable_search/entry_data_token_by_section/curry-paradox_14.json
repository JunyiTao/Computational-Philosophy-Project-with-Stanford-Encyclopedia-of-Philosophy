    "main_text": "The Significance of Curry\u2019s Paradox || Pointing to a General Paradox Structure\n5.2 Pointing to a General Paradox Structure\n\n\nThe negation-free status of Curry\u2019s paradox matters for a second\nreason. Prior makes the following important point:\n\n\n\nWe can \u2026 say not only that Curry\u2019s paradox does not\ninvolve negation but that even Russell\u2019s paradox presupposes\nonly those properties of negation which it shares with implication.\n (Prior 1955:\n 180)[23]\n\n\n\n\nWhat he has in mind is that Russell\u2019s paradox and Curry\u2019s\nparadox can be understood as resulting from the same general\nstructure, which can be instantiated either using negation or\n using a\n conditional.[24]\n\n\n\nThe general structure can be made explicit by defining a type of unary\nconnective that gives rise to Curry\u2019s paradox, and showing how\nthis type is exemplified both by negation and by a unary connective\ndefined in terms of a conditional.\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Curry connective)\n Let \\(\\pi\\) be a sentence in the language of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). The unary connective \\(\\odot\\) is a Curry\nconnective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided it satisfies two\nprinciples: \n\n\\[\\tag{P1}\n\\textrm{If} \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha \\textrm{ and } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha \\textrm{ then } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi.\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{P2}\n\\textrm{If } \\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha \\textrm{ then } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is such that Id holds and that for some pair of\nsentences \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\), (i) \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\odot\\mu\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) \\(\\odot\\) is\na Curry connective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). In that case\n \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\n \\pi\\).[25]\n\n\nProof:  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rll}\n1  & \\mu \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mu &\n  \\textrm{Id }\\\\\n2  & \\mu \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\mu &\n  \\textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n3  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\mu &\n  \\textrm{2 P2 }\\\\\n4  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mu &\n  \\textrm{3 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n5  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi &\n  \\textrm{3, 4 P1 }\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma can now be instantiated in two\ndifferent ways, so as to yield either Curry\u2019s paradox or a\nnegation paradox:\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain Curry\u2019s paradox, let the unary connective \\(\\odot\\) be\nsuch that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), and let\n\\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\mu\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then P1 amounts to\nthe instance of MP used in our derivation of the Curry-Paradox Lemma,\nwhile P2 is nothing other than our rule Cont. \n\n\\[\\tag{MP}\n\\textrm{If }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\textrm{ and }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{Cont}\n\\textrm{If }\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\n\\]\n\n \n\n\nTo obtain a negation paradox, let \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) be \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\),\nand let \\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\lnot\\mu\\)\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[26]\n Then P1 amounts to an instance of ex contradictione\nquodlibet (or \u201cexplosion\u201d), while P2 is a\nreductio principle. \n\n\\[\\tag{ECQ}\n\\textrm{If }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\textrm{ and }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{Red}\n\\textrm{If }\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\n\\]\n\n \n\n\n\nPrior\u2019s point is that the features of negation that are relevant\nto Russell\u2019s paradox or the Liar paradox are exhausted by\nits status as a Curry connective. This makes clear why these\nparadoxes do not depend on features of negation, such as excluded\nmiddle or double negation elimination, that fail to hold in\nnonclassical theories where negation remains a Curry connective (e.g.,\n in intuitionistic theories, where ECQ and Red both\n hold).[27]\n\n\n\nMoreover, a Curry connective need not be very negation-like at all. It\n may fail to be even a minimal negation (see entry on\n negation),\n since it need not obey the law of double introduction:\n\n\\[\\tag{DI}\n\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\odot\\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). Then in order for \\(\\odot\\) to obey DI, it would\nhave to be the case that \\(\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} (\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi) {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). That principle is violated by a\nnumber of non-classical theories for which \\(\\odot\\), when defined\n this way, does qualify as a Curry\n connective.[28]\n\n\n\nTo summarize: Curry\u2019s paradox points to a general structure\ninstantiated by a wide range of paradoxes. This structure\ndoesn\u2019t itself involve negation, but it is also displayed by\nparadoxes that (unlike Curry\u2019s paradox) do essentially involve\nnegation, such as Russell\u2019s paradox and the Liar paradox.\n\n\nThe issue of which paradoxes display a common structure becomes\nimportant in light of the \u201cprinciple of uniform solution\u201d\ninfluentially advocated by Priest (1994). According to this principle,\nparadoxes that belong to the \u201csame kind\u201d should receive\nthe \u201csame kind of solution\u201d. Suppose that we delimit one\nkind of paradox as follows:\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Generalized Curry paradox) We have a\ngeneralized Curry paradox in any case where the assumptions stated in\nthe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma appear to hold.\n\n\nAssuming one accepts the principle of uniform solution, the question\nbecomes what counts as proposing a uniform solution to all generalized\nCurry paradoxes. In particular, does it suffice to show, for every\ninstance of the kind thus delimited, that what appears to be a Curry\nconnective in fact fails to be one? It would seem that this should\nindeed be enough. It\u2019s unclear why uniformity should\nadditionally require that all seeming Curry connectives fail to\nqualify as such in virtue of violating the same\ncondition. For instance, suppose that negation and our unary\nconnective defined using \\({\\rightarrow}\\) both appear to satisfy the\ngeneralized principle P2, in the former case because \\({\\lnot}\\)\nappears to obey Red and in the latter case because \\({\\rightarrow}\\)\nappears to obey Cont. Unless these two appearances share a common\nsource (e.g., an implicit reliance on structural contraction, as\nclaimed by Zardini 2011), there need be nothing objectionably\nnon-uniform about taking one appearance at face value while dismissing\nthe other as deceptive. (For discussion of the philosophical issue\nhere, applied to a different class of paradoxes, see the exchange in\nSmith 2000 and Priest 2000.)\n\nIf that is right, the desideratum that generalized Curry paradoxes be\nresolved uniformly needn\u2019t discriminate between the various\nlogically revisionary solutions that have been pursued. These include\nthe following three options:\n\nOne might hold that it is principle P1 alone that fails when\n\\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is instantiated as \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\) (to get a negation\nparadox), whereas it is P2 alone that fails when \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is\ninstantiated as \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) (to get a Curry paradox).\nOn this approach, ECQ and Cont fail, while Red and MP hold (Priest\n1994, 2006).\nOne might hold that P2 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, Red and Cont fail, while ECQ and MP hold\n(Field 2008; Zardini 2011).\n\n\nOne might hold that P1 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, ECQ and MP fail, while Red and Cont hold\n(Beall 2015; Ripley 2013).\n\n\nThus, for example, Priest\u2019s own approach would count as\nresolving Curry\u2019s paradox and the Liar paradox uniformly qua\nexamples of generalized Curry paradox. This would be the case\ndespite the fact that Priest evaluates Liar sentences as both true and\nfalse, whereas he rejects the claim that Curry sentences are true.\n\nIn any event, Curry\u2019s paradox raises challenges in connection\nwith the issue of what type of uniformity should be required of\nsolutions to various paradoxes (see also Zardini 2015). Priest himself calls attention to a\nkind of paradox narrower than the generalized Curry paradoxes, a kind\nwhose instances include the negation paradoxes but exclude\nCurry\u2019s paradox. This kind is picked out by Priest\u2019s\n\u201cInclosure Schema\u201d (2002);\n see the entry on\n self-reference.\n One ongoing dispute is about whether there might be a version of\nCurry\u2019s paradox that counts as an \u201cinclosure\nparadox\u201d, though it resists Priest\u2019s uniform dialetheic\nsolution to such paradoxes (see the exchange in Beall\n2014b, Weber et\nal. 2014, and Beall 2014a, as\nwell as Pleitz 2015).\n",
