In this entry, the term is used to refer to the family of\nevaluative judgments and behavior assessed by implicit measures (e.g.,\ncategorization judgments on an IAT). These measures mimic some\nrelevant aspects of judgment and decision-making outside the lab\n(e.g., time pressure). But what do these measures measure? With some\nblurry boundaries, philosophical and psychological theories can be\ndivided into five groups. Implicit measures might provide information\nabout attitudes (\u00a72.1), implicit processes (\u00a72.2), beliefs\n(\u00a72.3), traits (\u00a72.4), or situations (\u00a72.5). \n",
