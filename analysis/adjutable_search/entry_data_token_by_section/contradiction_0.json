LNC as Indemonstrable\n\n\nThe twin foundations of Aristotle's logic are the law of\nnon-contradiction (LNC) (also known as the law of contradiction, LC) and the\nlaw of excluded middle (LEM). In Metaphysics Book \u0393,\nLNC\u2014\u201cthe most certain of all principles\u201d\u2014is\ndefined as follows:\n It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time\nboth belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect,\nand all other specifications that might be made, let them be added to\nmeet local objections (1005b19\u201323).\n\n\nIt will be noted that this statement of the LNC is an explicitly modal\nclaim about the incompatibility of opposed properties applying to the\nsame object (with the appropriate provisos). Since \u0141ukasiewicz\n(1910), this ontological version of the principle has been\nrecognized as distinct from, and for Aristotle arguably prior to,\nthe logical formulation (\u201cThe opinion that opposite\nassertions are not simultaneously true is the firmest of\nall\u201d\u2014Met. 1011b13\u201314) and the psychological\nformulation (\u201cIt is impossible for anyone to believe that the\nsame thing is and is not, as some consider Heraclitus\nsaid\u201d\u2014Met. 1005b23\u201325) offered elsewhere in Book \u0393;\nwe return to Heraclitus below. Wedin (2004a), who argues for the\nprimacy of the ontological version (see also Meyer 2008, Other\nInternet Resources), formalizes it as\n\u00ac\u25ca(\u2203x)(Fx \u2227\n\u00acFx). These three formulations of LNC differ in important\nrespects, in particular as to whether the law is explicitly modal in\ncharacter, whether it applies to propositions or to properties and\nobjects, and whether it requires the invocation of a metalinguistic\ntruth predicate. (See also the entry \n Aristotle on non-contradiction.) \n\n\nFor Aristotle, the status of LNC as a first, indemonstrable principle\nis obvious. Those who mulishly demand a proof of LNC clearly\n\u201clack education\u201d: since \u201ca demonstration of\neverything is impossible\u201d, resulting in infinite regress. At\nleast some principles must be taken as primitive\naxiomata rather than derived from other\npropositions\u2014and what principle more merits this status than\nLNC? (1006a6\u201312). In first philosophy, as in mathematics, an axiom is\nboth indemonstrable and indispensable; without LNC, Aristotle argues, \u201ca is\nF\u201d and \u201ca is not F\u201d are\nindistinguishable and no argumentation is possible. While Sophists and\n\u201ceven many physicists\u201d may claim that it is\npossible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time and\nin the same respect, such a position self-destructs \u201cif only our\nopponent says something\u201d, since as soon as he opens his mouth to\nmake an assertion, any assertion, he must accept LNC. But\nwhat if he does not open his mouth? Against such an\nindividual \u201cit is ridiculous to seek an argument\u201d for he\nis no more than a vegetable (1006a1\u201315).\n\n\nThe celebrated Arab commentator Avicenna (ibn S\u012bn\u0101,\n980\u20131037) confronts the LNC skeptic with a more severe outcome than\nAristotle's vegetable reduction: \u201cAs for the obstinate, he must\nbe plunged into fire, since fire and non-fire are identical. Let him\nbe beaten, since suffering and not suffering are the same. Let him be\ndeprived of food and drink, since eating and drinking are identical to\nabstaining\u201d (Metaphysics I.8, 53.13\u201315).\nThe role of LNC as the basic, indemonstrable \u201cfirst\nprinciple\u201d is affirmed by Leibniz, for whom LNC is taken as\ninterdefinable with the Law of Identity that states that everything is\nidentical to itself: \u201cNothing should be taken as first\nprinciples but experiences and the axiom of identity or (what is the\nsame thing) contradiction, which is primitive, since otherwise there\nwould be no difference between truth and falsehood, and all\ninvestigation would cease at once, if to say yes or no were a matter\nof indifference\u201d (Leibniz 1696/Langley 1916: 13\u201314). For\nLeibniz, everybody\u2014even \u201cbarbarians\u201d\u2014must\ntacitly assume LNC as part of innate knowledge implicitly called upon\nat every moment, thus demonstrating the insufficiency of Locke's\nempiricism (ibid.,\n 77).[1]\n\n\nIn accounting for the incompatibility of truth and falsity, LNC lies\nat the heart of Aristotle's theory of opposition, governing both\ncontradictories and contraries.\n (See traditional square of opposition.)\n Contradictory opposites (\u201cShe is sitting\u201d/\u201cShe is\nnot sitting\u201d) are mutually exhaustive as well as mutually\ninconsistent; one member of the pair must be true and the other\nfalse, assuming with Aristotle that singular statements with \nvacuous subjects are always false. As it was put by the medievals,\ncontradictory opposites divide\nthe true and the false between them; for Aristotle, this is the\nprimary form of\n opposition.[2]\n Contrary opposites (\u201cHe is happy\u201d/\u201cHe is\nsad\u201d) are mutually inconsistent but not necessarily exhaustive;\nthey may be simultaneously false, though not simultaneously true. LNC\napplies to both forms of opposition in that neither contradictories\nnor contraries may belong to the same object at the same time and in\nthe same respect (Metaphysics 1011b17\u201319). What distinguishes\nthe two forms of opposition is a second indemonstrable principle, the\nlaw of excluded middle (LEM): \u201cOf any one subject, one thing\nmust be either asserted or denied\u201d (Metaphysics\n1011b24). Both laws pertain to contradictories, as in a paired\naffirmation (\u201cS is P\u201d) and denial\n(\u201cS isn't P\u201d): the negation is true\nwhenever the affirmation is false, and the affirmation is true when\nthe negation is false. Thus, a corresponding affirmation and negation\ncannot both be true, by LNC, but neither can they both be\nfalse, by LEM. But while LNC applies both to contradictory\nand contrary oppositions, LEM holds only for contradictories:\n\u201cNothing can exist between two contradictories, but something\nmay exist between contraries\u201d (Metaphysics 1055b2): a\ndog cannot be both black and white, but it may be neither.\n\n\nAs Aristotle explains in the Categories, the opposition\nbetween contradictories\u2014\u201cstatements opposed to each other\nas affirmation and negation\u201d\u2014is defined in two\nways. First, unlike contrariety, contradiction is restricted to\nstatements or propositions; terms are never related as\ncontradictories. Second, \u201cin this case, and in this case only,\nit is necessary for the one to be true and the other false\u201d\n(13b2\u20133). \n\n\nOpposition between terms cannot be contradictory in\nnature, both because only statements (subject-predicate combinations)\ncan be true or false (Categories 13b3\u201312) and because any two\nterms may simultaneously fail to apply to a given\n subject.[3]\n But two statements may be members of either a contradictory or a\ncontrary opposition. Such statements may be simultaneously false,\nalthough (as with contradictories) they may not be simultaneously\ntrue. The most striking aspect of the exposition for a modern reader\nlies in Aristotle's selection of illustrative material. Rather than\nchoosing an uncontroversial example involving mediate\ncontraries, those allowing an unexcluded middle (e.g. \u201cThis dog\nis white\u201d/\u201cThis dog is black\u201d; \u201cSocrates is\ngood\u201d/\u201cSocrates is bad\u201d), Aristotle offers a pair of\nsentences containing immediate contraries, \u201cSocrates is\nsick\u201d/\u201cSocrates is well\u201d. These propositions may\nboth be false, even though every person is either ill or well:\n\u201cFor if Socrates exists, one will be true and the other false,\nbut if he does not exist, both will be false; for neither\n\u2018Socrates is sick\u2019 nor \u2018Socrates is well\u2019 will\nbe true, if Socrates does not exist at all\u201d (13b17\u201319). But\ngiven a corresponding affirmation and negation, one will always be\ntrue and the other false; the negation \u201cSocrates is not\nsick\u201d is true whether the snub-nosed philosopher is healthy or\nnon-existent: \u201cfor if he does not exist, \u2018he is\nsick\u2019 is false but \u2018he is not sick\u2019 true\u201d\n(13b26\u201335).\n\n\nMembers of a canonical pair of contradictories are formally identical\nexcept for the negative particle:\nAn affirmation is a statement affirming something of\nsomething, a negation is a statement denying something of something\u2026It\nis clear that for every affirmation there is an opposite negation, and\nfor every negation there is an opposite affirmation\u2026Let us call an\naffirmation and a negation which are opposite a contradiction\n(De Interpretatione 17a25\u201335).\n\n\nBut this criterion, satisfied simply enough in the case of singular\nexpressions, must be recast in the case of quantified expressions,\nboth those which \u201csignify universally\u201d (\u201cevery\ncat\u201d, \u201cno cat\u201d) and those which do not (\u201csome\ncat\u201d, \u201cnot every cat\u201d).\n\n\nFor such cases, Aristotle shifts from a formal to a semantically based\ncriterion of opposition (17b16\u201325). Members of\nan A/O pair (\u201cEvery man is\nwhite\u201d/\u201cNot every man is white\u201d)\nor I/E pair (\u201cSome man is\nwhite\u201d/\u201cNo man is white\u201d) are contradictories\nbecause in any state of affairs one member of each pair must be true\nand the other false. Members of an A/E\npair\u2014\u201cEvery man is just\u201d/\u201cNo man is\njust\u201d\u2014constitute contraries, since these cannot both be\ntrue simultaneously but can both be false. The contradictories of\nthese contraries (\u201cNot every man is just\u201d/\u201cSome man\nis just\u201d) can be simultaneously true with reference to the same\nsubject (17b23\u201325). This last opposition of I\nand O statements, later to be dubbed subcontraries\nbecause they appear below the contraries on the traditional square, is\na peculiar opposition indeed; Aristotle elsewhere (Prior\nAnalytics 63b21\u201330) sees I and O as\n\u201conly verbally opposed\u201d, given the consistency of\nthe I statement, e.g. \u201cSome Greeks are bald\u201d,\nwith the corresponding O statement, \u201cSome Greeks aren't\nbald\u201d (or \u201cNot all Greeks are bald\u201d, which doesn't\nnecessarily amount to the same thing, given existential import;\nsee traditional square of opposition). \n\n\nThe same relations obtain for modal propositions, for propositions\ninvolving binary connectives like \u201cand\u201d and\n\u201cor\u201d, for quantificational adverbs, and for a range of\nother operators that can be mapped onto the square in analogous ways\nutilizing the same notions of contradictory and contrary opposition\nand with unilateral entailment definable on duals (see Horn\n1989). Thus for example we have the modal square below, based\non De Interpretatione 21b10ff. and Prior Analytics\n32a18\u201328, where the box and diamond symbols denote necessity and\npossibility, respectively. As with universal affirmatives and\nuniversal negatives, necessity and impossibility constitute\ncontraries: \u201cA priest must marry\u201d and \u201cA priest\ncan\u2019t marry\u201d can both be (and, on the Episcopalian reading, are)\nfalse but cannot both be true. \u201cA priest can marry\u201d and\n\u201cA priest can (if he wants) not marry\u201d are subcontraries;\nthese can be simultaneously true but not simultaneously false. And\nnecessity, as in \u201cA priest must marry\u201d, unilaterally\nentails its possibility dual counterpart, \u201cA priest may\nmarry\u201d.\n(1) Modal Square\n\n\n\nIn the twelfth century, Peter of Spain (1972: 7) offers a\nparticularly elegant formulation in his Tractatus; it will be\nseen that these apply to the modal propositions in (1) as well as to\nthe quantificational statements in the original square:\n\nThe law of contradictories is such that if one\ncontradictory is true the other is false and vice versa, for nothing\ncan be simultaneously true and false.\n \n \nEach contradictory is equivalent to (entails and is entailed by) the\nnegation of the other.\n\n\nThe law of contraries is such that if one is true the other is false\nbut not vice versa.\n\n  \nEach contrary statement entails the negation of the other but\nnot vice versa. [E.g. \u201cI am happy\u201d unilaterally entails\n\u201cI am not unhappy\u201d; \u201cIt is necessary that\n\u03a6\u201d unilaterally entails \u201cIt is not impossible that\n\u03a6\u201d.]\n\n\nThe law of subcontraries is such that if one is false the other is\ntrue but not vice versa.  \n\n\nBy these definitions, the three central species of opposition\u2014contradiction, contrariety, and subcontrariety\u2014are mutually inconsistent.\n",
