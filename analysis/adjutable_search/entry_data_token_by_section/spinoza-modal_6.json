    "main_text": "The Nature of Modality || Non-necessitarianism also vindicated\n3. The Ground of Modality\n\nA final and underexplored topic in Spinoza\u2019s modal metaphysics\nconcerns what we might call the ground of modality. There was\na lively dispute in the 17th century about the relationship\nbetween God and modality. Although there was a general consensus that\nmodal facts \u2013 like so much else \u2013 depend on God in some\nway or other, there was considerable disagreement over exactly how to\nunderstand that dependence. Monotheistic metaphysicians disagreed over\nboth (a) on what in God modal truths and modal truth-makers depend and\n(b) by what manner of dependence modal truths and modal-truth makers\ndepend on God. The first set of issues concerns the divine\nground of modality and the second concerns the grounding\nrelation that modality bears to its ground (for some recent\ndiscussions, see Chignell 2012 and Newlands 2013).\n\nSpinoza cannot accept two of the most prominent accounts proposed by\nhis contemporaries. According to Descartes, (a) modal truths and modal\ntruth-makers depend on God\u2019s volitions and (b) the form of\ndependence is efficient causation. According to Leibniz, (a) modal\ntruths and modal truth-makers depend on God\u2019s ideas and\nintellectual activities and (b) the form of dependence is ontological\nand does not involve efficient causation. However, Spinoza denies that\nGod\u2019s nature contains a will and intellect in the sense required\nfor these accounts (Ip17s).\n\nNonetheless, Spinoza thinks that all things depend on God (Ip15),\nand he points to an alternative account of how possibilities depend on\nGod. He claims that non-existing modes are grounded in God\u2019s\nactual attributes. \u201cThe ideas of singular things, or of modes,\nthat do not exist must be comprehended God\u2019s infinite idea in\nthe same way as the formal essences of singular things, or modes, are\ncontained in God\u2019s attributes\u201d (IIp8). He unpacks the\n\u201ccomprehension\u201d or containment of non-divine formal\nessences in conceptual terms: \u201cEssences [of non-existing things]\nare comprehended in another in such a way that they can be conceived\nthrough it\u201d (Ip8s2). This suggests that the essences of all\nthings, including non-existing things, are conceptually contained in\nGod\u2019s attributes.\n\nIn more general terms, Spinoza\u2019s idea seems to be that\npossibilities are grounded in God by being actually exemplified by\nGod, a view that fits nicely with interpretations of Spinoza\u2019s\nmodes as things that inhere in God (see section 1.3 above). Thus, it\nis possible for something to be thinking because God is actually a\nthinking thing (IIp1d). The grounding of possibility in actuality is a\nvery attractive metaphysical thesis in its own right, and\nSpinoza\u2019s God has a sufficiently rich nature to ground all\npossibilities by actually exemplifying them all (Ip15 and Ip16).\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the grounds of modality also presents an\ninteresting challenge to anyone attracted to the thesis that God\ngrounds possibilities, but who wants to deny that God directly\nexemplifies every possibility (Newlands 2016). Those unhappy with\nSpinoza\u2019s expansive divine nature would need to explain how it\nis that God grounds some possibilities, such as being extended,\nwithout actually being extended. One could follow Descartes in\nharkening back to the Scholastic notion of \u201ceminent\u201d\ncontainment, but Spinoza reads that appeal as the name of the problem,\nnot its solution. Leibniz was sometimes attracted to the idea that\nevery basic creaturely possibility is formed from God\u2019s\nnon-mental perfections, but he will have a hard time explaining\nhow every creaturely possibility can be constructed out of the sparse\nset of traditional divine perfections.\n\nWithout reducing creaturely possibilities to God\u2019s actual\nperfections (as idealists do with extension), Spinoza presents an\nalternative grounding thesis and a challenge. Let every possibility be\ngrounded in God via actual exemplification, even if this requires\nexpanding the divine nature beyond its traditional boundaries. For\nthose unwilling to follow Spinoza on this expansion, Spinoza\u2019s\nchallenge is for proponents of nearby alternatives to provide a\nnon-metaphorical explanation of how God grounds certain basic\npossibilities without actually and directly exemplifying them. Until\nsuch an account is given, Spinoza\u2019s biting conclusion offers an\nunmet challenge: \u201cBut by what divine power could [extension or\nany property not exemplified by God] be created? They are completely\nignorant of that. And this shows that they do not understand what they\nthemselves say\u201d (Ip15s). At the very least, Spinoza\u2019s\nchallenge highlights how his modal metaphysics extends beyond the\ntopic of necessitarianism and continues to invite wider\ninvestigation.\n",
