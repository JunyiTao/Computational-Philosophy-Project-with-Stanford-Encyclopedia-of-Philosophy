Where they\neach end up, is, of course, completely different. What is similar, on\nthe other hand, is their starting point; that is to say, the way they\narticulate the radical doubt with which they begin their respective\ninquiries; and for that reason Sanches has often been considered a\nprecursor of Descartes. It is undeniable that the personal expression\nof their scepticism as found both in That Nothing is Know\n(1581) and the Discourse on the Method (1637) share more than\na coincidental resemblance. Pamela Kraus points out in her\nintroduction to the Discourse on Method [DM], that the word\n\u201cdiscours\u201d had a wider meaning in the seventeenth century\nsignifying among other things \u201c\u2018talk\u2019 or\n\u2018conversation\u2019\u201d ([DM: 1]). But this was not the case\nfor Sanches, who wrote Quod nihil scitur over forty years\nearlier, and whose conversational style was in the service of a\ntreatise aimed at the Aristotelianism of his time, and particularly at\nthe Aristotelian notion of demonstrative truths. What is indeed\nstriking are the passages in the Discourse that seem to be\ndirectly lifted from the Iberian philosopher\u2019s 1581 treatise.\nHere are two examples: the first from Sanches, the latter from\nDescartes:\n\n\nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into everything in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\npreferred to it\u2026Subsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to\nquestion everything, and to examine facts themselves as though no one\nhad ever said anything about them, which is the proper method\n[\u201cmodus\u201d, QNS: 92] of acquiring knowledge. I\nbroke everything down into its ultimate first principles. Beginning as\nI did, my reflection at this point, the more I reflected the more I\ndoubted. (TNK: 167)\n\n\nHere is Descartes in the Discourse: \n\n\nFrom my childhood I have been nourished upon letters, and because I\nwas persuaded that by their means one could acquire a clear and\ncertain knowledge of all that is useful in life, I was extremely eager\nto learn them. But as soon as I had completed the course of study at\nthe end of which one is formally admitted to the ranks of the learned,\nI completely changed my opinion. I had found myself beset by so many\ndoubts and errors that I came to think I had gained nothing from my\nattempts to become educated but increasing recognition of my\nignorance. (Descartes 1637 [PWD: 112\u2013113])\n\n\nHe will later say that among the steps included in his method is the\ndirection of his mind into the \u201csimplest and most easily known\nobjects in order to ascend little by little, step by step, to\nknowledge of the most complex\u201d (1637 [PWD: 120]), which even if\nit is not exactly what Sanches meant by \u201cfirst principles\u201d\n[\u201cextrema principia\u201d, QNS: 92], it does sound a\nlot like it.\n\nIn any case, one of the first to note the similarities in tone, and\neven to go as far as to declare Sanches a precursor of Descartes was\n\u00c9tienne Gilson in his commentary on Discours de la\nm\u00e9thode (1925). More than Charron or the Montaigne of\nApologie de Raimond Sebond (1580), it is Sanches, says\nGilson, who seems to have had the greater impact on Descartes\u2019\ndoubt and his response to the sceptical position (1925: 267, 268;\nPaganini 2009: 254\u2013255), given the \u201cstriking parallelism\nof their respective experiences\u201d (1925: 267, my translation). In\nfact, the linking of their names in the seventeenth century at the\nuniversities of Utrecht, Groningen and Leiden, says Limbrick, is what\nled them to be considered Pyrrhonian sceptics with atheistic leanings\n(TNK: 82). What nonetheless remains unknown is when and how Descartes\ncame across Quod nihil scitur. In Les premi\u00e8res\npens\u00e9es de Descartes (1979), Henri Gouhier conjectures\nthat Descartes might have come across Quod nihil scitur\nsometime during his student years at La Fl\u00e8che\n(1606\u20131614), or read the 1618 Frankfurt edition of the treatise\n(1979: 116), \u201cwhen he was in Frankfurt for the coronation of the\nEmperor Ferdinand II in 1619\u201d (Limbrick 1988: 83). According to\nLimbrick the Frankfurt 1618 edition of Quod nihil scitur\nseems to have impacted the European philosophical scene, and to have\ncontributed to Sanches\u2019 reputation as a leading Pyrrhonian\nsceptic (1988: 85). What is not at all convincing is that Descartes\nwould have been apprised of Sanches\u2019 treatise through a letter\naddressed by someone by the name of Huebner (supposedly an English\ndoctor), to Marin Mersenne.\n\nThis letter of August, 1641, can be found in Correspondance du P.\nMarin Mersenne, religieux minime. X, Du 6 ao\u00fbt 1640 \u00e0 fin\nd\u00e9cembre 1641 (1967: 730) wherein the author praises\nSanches\u2019 ingenious exaggerations concerning the possibility of\nacquiring perfect knowledge, and criticizes Cartesianism for not being\nable to advance (\u201cnon progreditur\u201d) beyond its\n\u201chyperbolical doubt\u201d (1967: 730) . But again, the letter\nis too late to serve as proof of Descartes\u2019 knowledge of\nSanches\u2019 treatise prior to the writing and publication of the\nDiscourse. Its intended target seems to have been an\nobjection to the perceived scepticism of the Meditations.\nThus, if Mersenne informed Descartes of Huebner\u2019s letter\ncomparing his work to that Sanches\u2019s, then the letter would only\nhave apprised Descartes that he was being compared with the Iberian\n\u201cPyrrhonist\u201d, which would not have made Descartes very\nhappy, given that by this time he had grown tired of answering\nobjections and trying to explain why his method was instead intended\nto dispel scepticism and ground a science on clear and distinct ideas\n(Mullin 2000: 8). Therefore, if we can imagine Descartes being upset\nabout being compared with Sanches, one can at least partially\nunderstand why he would be so, and would \u201crefuse\u201d to\nanswer the objection (Mullin 2000: 8). It has been conjectured, for\ninstance, that Descartes might have been thinking of Sanches when he\nwrote in the Discourse that the reason for his undertaking\nwas not to imitate or to copy \u201cthe sceptics, who doubt only for\nthe sake of doubting\u201d but rather \u201cto reach\ncertainty\u201d (1637 [PWD: 125]). Significantly, while most scholars\nof Sanches\u2019 work have noted the similarities between Sanches and\nDescartes, for others like Joseph Moreau (1960) and Joaquim de\nCarvalho (1955), there are significant differences. These similarities\ndisplayed in two parallel columns in the introduction to\nSanches\u2019 Opera philosophica (1955: xxx\u2013xxxiii),\nmerely establish, argues Carvalho, a \u201ccorrelation of\nwords\u201d (1955: xxxiii, my translation). One important difference\nbetween the two thinkers, says Carvalho, is that although Sanches\ndoubts our perfect knowledge of external things, he never doubts their\nexistence. This obviously was not the case for Descartes, for whom the\nsearch for certainty was the search for whatever knowledge could be\nacquired through the light of reason, and not through the senses. Thus\nfor Moreau one major difference between them was their opposing views\nconcerning the truths of mathematics (1960: 30\u201334): for Sanches\na posteriori and dubitable; for Descartes a priori\nand indubitable. What they did share was a rejection of the Scholastic\nappeal to external authority. For Descartes, the opinions of others\ncould never lead to the kind of certainty only a mind\n(cogito) reflecting on the content of its own thoughts could\nreach; and for Sanches the opinions of scholarly\nauthorities\u2014however illustrious\u2014did not help us to arrive\nat perfect knowledge. The assumed \u201cknowledge\u201d of the\nauthorities was derived from syllogistic and demonstrative logic,\nwhich depended on the circularity of its definitions and premises\n(verba) to arrive at their conclusions concerning things\n(rerum). More often than not, these Aristotelian scholars\nwith their verbal gymnastics created great confusion out of what was\notherwise clear, even to a child.\n\nThough a number of Sanches\u2019 contemporaries accused him of\nadvocating a radical form of Academic scepticism that led to\natheism\u2014as also occurred with Descartes\u2014Sanches\u2019\nsceptical project was not, as it may first seem given the title of the\ntreatise, either dogmatic or wholly destructive. And on this vital\npoint Richard H. Popkin (1963: ix; 1964: 42) and Gianni Paganini\n(2009: 249) concur. For Paganini, in fact, \n\n\nSanches\u2019s Quod nihil scitur contains, besides a\nskeptical demolition, also a pars construens, which seems\nparticularly relevant in order to understand the Cartesian certainty\nabout reflexive knowledge, typically the cogito. (2009: 249)\n\n\n\nThe personal crisis experienced by Sanches and Descartes which\nmotivated their epistemological inquiry concerning what could and\ncould not be known with certainty, was responded to by means of\nself-reflection. In both cases, albeit with very different approaches,\nthe self was the only legislator of certainty, and the only thing that\ncould be counted upon in founding a science: in Descartes\u2019 case,\nfounded on unquestionable internal, logical principles (\u201cI\ncannot doubt my own existence\u201d), and in Sanches\u2019\ncase, founded on the material things (rerum) the I\nperceives, albeit imperfectly. Significantly, what constituted the\ncertainty of the internal states for Descartes did not constitute\ncertainty for Sanches, and moreover such \u201ccertainty\u201d could\nnot serve as the foundation of a true science. In this respect,\nwhereas the late sixteenth century Sanches was operating within a\npre-Galilean Weltanschauung, Descartes undertaking studies in physics\nand astronomy that paralleled those of Galileo and\n\u201cGalilean\u201d science with its emphasis on mathematical\ndemonstration. For Descartes, mathematics was the language of Nature,\nand even physical things or \u201cnatural phenomena\u201d were\nmathematical, as he stated in the \u201cPrinciples of\nPhilosophy\u201d (1644 [PWD: 247]). This was clearly not the case for\nSanches, who in his letter to Clavius\n (\u00a72.2),\n denied the universal and a priori truths of mathematics,\nreducing mathematics to mere empirical measurement. In short, if\nDescartes\u2019 method culminated in the \u201cindubitable\u201d\ntruths of mathematics placed at the service of sciences like physics,\noptics, and astronomy, Sanches\u2019 sceptical method, with its\nacceptance of imperfect knowledge, culminated in the probable and\nempirical \u201ctruths\u201d of the science of medicine. Descartes,\nthe philosopher, mathematician, and physicist; Sanches, the\nphilosopher and physician: the former emphasized the mind over the\nbody (res cogitans over res extensa), and the latter\nthe body over the mind.\n\nDoubtlessly, such a generalization can only be taken so far; for\nDescartes too wanted to \u201creplace the speculative philosophy\ntaught in the schools\u201d with a \u201cpractical philosophy\u201d\nthat would employ his method even in an applied science like medicine,\nwhose primary goal was to maintain the health of the body: \u201cthe\nchief good and the foundation of all the other goods in life\u201d\n(1637 [PWD: 142\u2013143]). Most importantly was (1) their equal\nconcern with formulating a method that would allow them to arrive at\nknowledge of the world, and (2) the constructive aspect of their\nrespective scepticism, which in both cases was a starting point. And\nthough it seems by all accounts that Descartes integrated\nSanches\u2019 autobiographical narrative into the Discourse on\nthe Method, without due attribution, their projects were quite\ndifferent: one epistemologically based on sense perception, the other\nmetaphysically based on internal (a priori) first principles.\nIronically, it has been argued that Descartes turned \u201cfirst\nphilosophy\u201d into epistemology.\n",
