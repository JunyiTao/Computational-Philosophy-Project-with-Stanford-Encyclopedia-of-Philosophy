    "main_text": "Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions || Descriptive theories of pronominal anaphora\n4.2 Descriptive theories of pronominal anaphora\n\nConsider sentence (1) again.\n\n(1) A man came in the room. He turned on the TV.\n\n\nOne of the arguments that Strawson (1952) enlisted on behalf of the\nreferential theory of descriptions was the following. Since the\npronoun in (1) gets its content from the description that it is\nanaphoric on, and because the pronoun refers, it must be the case that\nthe description also refers. Strawson\u2019s idea was that\ndescriptions refer because their anaphoric pronouns do.\n\nThere are obviously two responses to Strawson here. One may either\nreject the idea that the content of the pronoun is in some sense\ndependent upon the description (for example, one might claim it\nindependently picks out some object raised to salience (Lewis 1979),\none might claim that it is a bound variable (Geach 1962)), or one can\nargue that the pronoun is a kind of definite description in disguise.\nThis third idea has been explored by Parsons (1978, Other Internet\nResources), Cooper (1979), Davies (1981), Neale (1990, ch. 6), Heim\n(1990), Ludlow (1994), van Rooy (2001), and Elbourne (2005) (the view\nis sometimes attributed to Evans (1977), but it is more accurate to\nsay that he thought the pronouns had their references fixed rigidly by\ndescriptive content). As noted above, the basic idea is that the\npronoun in (1) may stand proxy for the square-bracketed definite\ndescription in (1\u2032).\n\n(1\u2032) A man came in. [The man who came in the room] turned on the\nTV.\n\n\nThe philosophical attraction of this view should be obvious. What it\nallows us to do is to make sense of cases where we employ nondenoting\npronouns in negative existentials, belief reports, and fictional\ncontexts. Examples would be the following:\n\n\n(15) The present king of France doesn\u2019t clean my pool. He\ndoesn\u2019t exist, either.\n\n(16) Mary believes that the present king of France exists and that he\ncleans my pool.\n\n\nClearly if these pronouns are referring expressions then any victories\nwon through the theory of descriptions are going to be fleeting. In\neffect, all the unwelcome metaphysical commitments that we banished by\nusing descriptions would re-enter via the back door as soon as we\nemploy anaphoric pronouns in our discourse. But if we treat anaphors\nas standing proxy for descriptions, the back door is blocked as\nwell.\n\nConsider an example like (16), with the descriptive material spelled\nout.\n\n(16\u2032) Mary believes that ([the x: x is a\npresent king of France](x exists) and [the x:\nx is a present king of France & x\nexists](x cleans my pool))\n\n\nMary\u2019s belief is strange, but general for all that, so we can\nreport it without being committed to the existence of a present king\nof France.\n\nNor is this strategy necessarily limited to pronominal anaphora.\nLudlow (1999, 2000) has argued that temporal and modal anaphora can be\nhandled in a similar manner. In effect, one can take a temporal\nanaphor as standing proxy for a when-clause and a modal anaphor like\n\u2018that\u2019 in \u2018that would have hurt\u2019 as standing\nproxy for the antecedent of a conditional.\n\nTo illustrate, consider an example like (17), due to Partee\n(1972).\n\n(17) I turned the stove off.\n\n\nNow clearly this does not mean that I turned the stove off once in my\nlife, but rather there is intuitively some relevant time when I turned\nit off\u2014for example, when I left the house this morning. The\nstandard analysis would have it that I refer to a past time or past\ntime interval here, but such an analysis does not go down well with\npresentists, who do not believe that there are such intervals, and at\na minimum we might think there is something epistemologically\ntroubling about referring to past and future times (to see this,\nconsider what a Russellian might say, given that some notion of direct\nacquaintance is required on the Russellian view). An alternative would\nbe to suppose that the implicit temporal anaphora here can be\naccounted for by the introduction of descriptive material\u2014an\nexplicit temporal when-clause\u2014as in (18), for example.\n\n(18) I turned the stove off [when I left the house this morning].\n\n\nThe presentist can then treat \u2018when\u2019 as a primitive tense\nthat holds between propositions. (See Ludlow (1999) for discussion of\ndifficulties with this strategy.) As in the pronominal anaphora case,\ndescriptive material does the work that reference does in most other\naccounts of the semantics of temporal and modal discourse. Again, the\ngoal is metaphysical austerity and faithfulness to our epistemic\nposition.\n\nClearly descriptive anaphora represents a powerful extension of\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions and a useful tool for\npresentists and modal antirealists. For all of that, the theory has\nencountered a number of objections. Consider (19), for example, and a\nparaphrase (20) in which the pronoun is rendered as a description.\n\n\n(19) If a man enters the room, he will turn the switch.\n\n(20) If a man enters the room, the man who enters will turn the\nswitch.\n\n\nHeim (1982) observed that (20) (unlike (19)) implies that a unique man\nentered the room and that (20) will therefore be false if two men\nenter the room. The question is, is there some way to answer this\nobjection and retain the descriptive analysis of anaphora? Davies\n(1981), Lappin (1989), Neale (1990, chapter 6), Krifka (1996), and\nYoon (1996) explored the possibility that the descriptive pronouns are\nin fact numberless\u2014that is, the pronoun in (20) might in fact be\nproxy for something like \u2018the man or men who enter\u2019. (See\nKanazawa (2001) for a literature review and criticism of this\nidea.)\n\nAnother idea, considered in Heim (1990), Ludlow (1994), and Elbourne\n(2005) is to see how descriptive theories of pronouns fare when\nembedded within an event-based (or situation based) theories of\nconditionals like those articulated by Berman (1987), Kratzer (1989),\nand Lycan (1984). On an event-based analysis of conditionals, we would\nexpect a treatment of (19) along the lines of (21).\n\n(21) For every minimal event/situation in which a man enters the room,\nhe flips the switch in that event/situation.\n\n\nSentence (21) seems to accurately reflect the truth conditions of\n\u2018He will turn the switch\u2019, even in the case where two men\nturn the switch simultaneously. To see this we need merely recognize\nthat even though two men (say Ralph and Norton) may turn the switch\nsimultaneously, it is still the case that we can recognize two\nindependent minimal events; one where Ralph turns the switch and one\nwhere Norton turns the switch. The strategy is to show that the\nsupposed loss of uniqueness is an epiphenomenon, and is due to the\nfact that the descriptive pronoun\u2019s denotation is relativized to\nevents.\n\nUnfortunately, there are more sophisticated versions of these cases\nwhere simple relativization to events will not do. These include the\nsage plant examples discussed in Heim (1982, 1990) and Kadmon\n(1990).\n\n(22) If a man buys a plant he buys nine others along with it.\n\n\nHere the problem is that the minimal event appears to contain ten sage\nplants, so we are left to ask how the pronoun, rendered as a definite\ndescription complete with a uniqueness claim, is supposed to work.\nThere is no unique sage plant in the minimal events. Or at least a\nmore detailed story needs to be told.\n\nFinally, there is (23). (Heim (1990) attributes the example to Hans\nKamp and Jan van Eijk).\n\n(23) If a bishop meets another bishop, he blesses him.\n\n\nThe interesting feature of this example is that the uniqueness\nimplications of the definite descriptions remain problematic, for they\nimply that there is a unique satisfier of the description in each\nevent. But notice that because the bishops bless each other, it\nappears there is no unique individual that satisfies either\ndescription in the consequent of (23 ). This class of problems,\nsometimes called bishop sentences, has yielded a number of\nproposed solutions. For example, Elbourne (2005) has argued that the\nminimal situation story can suffice if there are subsituations\ncontaining only one bishop. Here is a crude version of the idea: If\nthere is a subsituation s1 with only one bishop and a subsituation s2\nwith one different bishop, there could be a containing situation s0 in\nwhich the bishops from those subsituations bless each other (see Kroll\n(2008) and Elbourne (2009, 2010) for further discussion).\n\nAn alternative idea is to treat the pronoun in these cases as\nsemantically akin to an indefinite description rather than a definite\ndescription. (See Groendijk and Stokhof (1991), Chierchia (1996), van\nder Does (1994), and also see van Rooy (2001) for criticism. The\nproposal in King (1978) has a similar effect.) If we make this move,\nthen (24) might be glossed as in (24\u2032).\n\n(24\u2032) If a bishop meets another bishop, a bishop that meets\nanother bishop blesses a bishop that is met by another bishop.\n\n\nSimilarly, the sage plant example in (23) would receive the gloss in\n(23\u2032).\n\n(23\u2032) If a man buys a sage plant he buys nine others along with\na sage plant he bought.\n\n\nSuch solutions thus surrender the uniqueness entailment in\nRussell\u2019s proposal (we will return to this idea in section 6.1).\nOf course, as Kadmon (1990) stressed, pronouns typically do appear to\nintroduce uniqueness, as an example like (25) shows.\n\n(25) Leif has a chair. It is in the kitchen.\n\n\nNotice that the first sentence doesn\u2019t introduce uniqueness, so\nthe pronoun introduces something that indefinites do not. What this\nmeans is that whatever account we give of pronouns\u2014through\ndynamic semantics or whatever\u2014we will want to account for this\nvariation in interpretation in a principled way. We want to know\nprecisely why a pronoun looks like a definite description here, but an\nindefinite description there. Whether extant accounts are satisfactory\nin this respect is subject to debate.\n\nOf course, none of this is to say that solving this problem will close\nthe book on the analysis of descriptive pronouns. A number of other\npuzzles remain, including the problem of pronominal contradiction,\nwhich has been discussed by Strawson (1952), Davies (1981), Ludlow and\nNeale (1991), and van Rooy (2001) among many others. Consider the\nfollowing brief dialogue.\n\nA: A man fell in front of the train.\n\nB: He didn\u2019t fall, he was pushed.\n\n\nThe problem is that if the pronoun is to have its descriptive content\nrecovered from previous discourse, the pronoun \u2018He\u2019 is\ngoing to stand proxy for a description like \u2018the man who fell in\nfront of the train\u2019 or \u2018a man who fell in front of the\ntrain\u2019. Here, considerations about uniqueness implications are\nof little help. One possibility, advocated by Davies (1981) and Ludlow\nand Neale (1991) is to say that speaker B is engaged in a kind of\npretense\u2014playing along with speaker A, as if saying with scare\nquotes something like B\u2032.\n\nB\u2032: The \u201cman who fell in front of the train\u201d\ndidn\u2019t fall, he was pushed.\n\n Other strategies are also in play, for example one might ignore\nthe descriptive content of the antecedent and build the content out of\nthematic roles like agent and theme (Ludlow 1994) or\nphi-features\u00a0represented in the pronoun like gender\n(\u2018she\u2019 as \u201cthe feminine entity\u201d; Ahn 2019), or\nperhaps metalinguistic material (\u201cthe person you spoke\nof\u201d). Whatever the ultimate disposition of these cases, it is\nfair to say that there are more issues here than whether pronouns are\nto be treated as standing proxy for definite descriptions or\nindefinite descriptions.\n",
