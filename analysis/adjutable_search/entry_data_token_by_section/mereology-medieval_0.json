    "main_text": "Forums for medieval mereology\n1. Forums for medieval mereology\n\nOne can find discussions of parts and wholes throughout the medieval\nphilosophical and theological literature. But there are two places\nwhere the student of medieval mereology can reliably look to find\nsustained reflections on parts and wholes as such, namely, treatments\nof division and the Topics. The main authority on division and the\nTopics is the Roman philosopher\n Boethius\n (c. 480\u2013524 C.E.). Boethius is now most famous for his\nConsolation of Philosophy, but his influence on medieval\nphilosophy is as much due to his commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation, his theological\ntreatises, and his handbooks on logic (see Chadwick 1981 and Marenbon\n2003). Boethius\u2019 treatment of division is found in his handbook\nOn Division (De divisione). His treatment of the\nTopics is found in his handbook On the Topical Differences\n(De differentiis topicis) and in his commentary on\nCicero\u2019s treatment of the Topics (In Ciceronis\nTopica).\n",
