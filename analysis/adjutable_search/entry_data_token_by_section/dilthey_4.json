Whereas the early prize-essay on\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics had been more focused on textual\nand theological interpretation, the new essay makes hermeneutics a\nconnecting link between philosophy and history. Dilthey argues that\nthe study of history can be reliable only if it is possible to raise\nthe understanding of what is singular to the level of universal\nvalidity. Here he also comes to the realization that \n\n\nthe inner experience through which I obtain reflexive awareness of my\nown condition can never by itself bring me to a consciousness of my\nown individuality. I experience the latter only through a comparison\nof myself with others. (1900/SW.IV, 236) \n\n\nOthers cannot be assumed to be mere extensions of myself. They are\naccessible to me only from the outside. It is the task of\nunderstanding to confer \u201can inside\u201d to what is first given\nas \u201ca complex of external sensory signs\u201d (1900/SW.IV,\n236).\n\nWhereas up to then the intelligibility of lived experience had been\nassumed to provide us an understanding of ourselves, now Dilthey\nasserts that we can understand ourselves only by means of our\nobjectifications. The understanding of self requires me to approach\nmyself as others do, that is, from the outside to the inside. \n\n\nThe process of understanding, insofar as it is determined by common\nconditions and epistemological means, must everywhere have the same\ncharacteristics. (1900/SW.IV, 237) \n\n\nTo the extent that rules can guide the understanding of the\nobjectifications of life they make possible a theory of\ninterpretation. Hermeneutics is the theory of interpretation that\nrelates to all human objectifications\u2014that is, not only speech\nand writing, but also visual artistic expressions, more casual\nphysical gestures as well as observable actions or deeds.\n\nThis new hermeneutic perspective that approaches the inside from the\noutside also alters Dilthey\u2019s conception of psychic structure.\nIn the first of three \u201cStudies Toward the Foundation of the\nHuman Sciences\u201d dating from 1904\u20139, Dilthey considers what\nlinguistic expressions can teach us about the intentionality of\nconsciousness. No longer merely explicating the breadth of psychic\nlife through the interweavings of acts of cognition, feeling and\nwilling, Dilthey uses expressions such as \u201cI am worried about\nsomething\u201d to disclose the referential structure of a lived\nexperience. Psychic acts have contents that are related to the objects\nof the world by means of what Dilthey calls attitudinal stances. These\njudgmental attitudes toward the world are \n\n\nindefinite in number. Asking, believing, presuming, claiming, taking\npleasure in, approving, liking and its opposite, wishing, desiring,\nand willing are such modifications of the psychic attitude.\n(1904\u20139/SW.III, 43) \n\n\nThese attitudinal and judgmental stances are not just cognitive, but\npre-delineate something more encompassing, which can be called\n\u201creflective knowledge\u201d to distinguish it from the direct\nknowing of lived experience and reflexive awareness. This judgmental\nreflective knowledge (Wissen) adds to the conceptual\ncognition (Erkenntnis) of reality a \u201cpositing of\nvalues\u201d and \u201cthe determination of purposes and the\nestablishment of rules.\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 25)\n\nWhile the kind of epistemology (Erkenntnistheorie)\nestablished by Kant and others suffices for the natural sciences, the\nhuman sciences require a more full-blooded theory of knowledge\n(Theorie des Wissens). Knowledge is to be\n\u201cdistinguished from a mere representation, presumption,\nquestion, or assumption by the fact that a content appears here with a\nsense of objective necessity\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III,\n27\u201328). This objective necessity is to be located in the\nevidentness that accompanies thinking that is properly executed and\nreaches its goal whether through the self-given reality of lived\nexperience or the \u201cgivenness that binds us to an outer\nperception\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 28).\n\nFor the human sciences, things in the world are not merely cognitively\napprehended as phenomenal objects, but known as real for our\nlife-concerns (Lebensbez\u00fcge). Thinking of the unfinished\nmanuscripts in his office, Dilthey writes in the Second Study Toward\nthe Foundation of the Human Sciences:\n\nI am tired from overworking; having reviewed my files, I worry about\ntheir unfinished contents, whose completion demands incalculably more\nwork from me. All this \u201cabout\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, and\n\u201ctoward\u201d, all these references of what is remembered to\nwhat is experienced, in short, all these structural inner relations,\nmust be apprehended by me, since I now want to apprehend the fullness\nof the lived experience exhaustively. And precisely in order to\nexhaust it, I must regress further in the structural network to the\nmemories of other lived experiences. (1904\u20139/SW.III, 50)\n\n\nEvery attempt to characterize a lived experience leads beyond it to\nother structurally related experiences that ground it. This involves\nnot just an observational process of willful attention, but also an\ninvoluntary \u201cbeing-pulled-along by the state of affairs\nitself\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 51) to other constituent parts of\nthe nexus of human knowledge.\n\nSome of these refinements incorporated into Dilthey\u2019s\ndescriptive program were inspired by reading Husserl\u2019s\nLogical Investigations (1900\u201301). Dilthey specifically\nfollows Husserl in his account of how language contributes to\n\u201csignificative apprehension\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 60). In\nreading words we do not represent them as mere sets of letters but\nfulfill their meaning by representing their objects. There is a\ntriadic structural relation between the intuitive content of a\nlinguistic expression, an act that gives it meaning, and the object\nthat embodies that meaning as what is expressed. But whereas\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology focused in the conceptual structures of\nobjective apprehension, Dilthey gives equal attention to the felt\nstructures of what he calls \u201cobjective having\u201d\n(1904\u20139/SW.III, 66). In objective apprehension we progress from\nattitude to objects, in objective having we regress from objects to\nattitude. This regressive turn from the outside to the inside is\nbrought to bear on how feelings are to be interpreted. \u201c Whether\nwe feel our own state or some object, it involves only a state of\nbeing as a kind of attitude\u2026. The way this state of being\ndepends on outer objects or on the state of the subject is obscured\nthrough an inverse attitude that loses itself in the depth of the\nsubject\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 69). Instead of regarding\nfeelings merely as subjective states such as pleasure or displeasure,\nthey can be interpreted as attitudes that assess what is given in\nconsciousness as either furthering or diminishing one\u2019s state of\nbeing in the world. Feelings can be added to our earlier list of\nattitudes.\n\nFeelings as attitudes allow us to evaluate the world. Our values\nexpress adjudicative attitudes based on feeling. Although the setting\nof purposes is grounded in the lived experience of values, the life of\nfeelings has an immanent teleology that does not require it to go over\ninto the desire to act. The structural nexus of willing is thus\ndifferent from that of feeling. There are many feelings that evoke\nfurther feelings rather than the impulse to do something in response\nto them. A feeling of suffering can for instance elicit a kind of\nself-pity that spreads the suffering and elicits a\n\u201cdistinctively mellow\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 76) mood that\nimmobilizes.\n\nThe final general attitude relevant to the structural nexus of\nknowledge is that of willing. In the lived experiences of willing\n\u201cwe possess a reflexive awareness of an intention to realize a\nstate of affairs\u201d (1904\u20139/SW.III, 82). If we call this\nstate of affairs to be realized a \u201cpurpose\u201d then what is\nexpected from this purpose is a satisfaction of some kind.\n2.3.2 Reinterpreting Purposiveness and Distinguishing Elementary Understanding and Higher Understanding.\n\nDilthey\u2019s most important work is The Formation\n(Aufbau) of the Historical World in the Human Sciences\nof 1910. Here Dilthey applies the same kind of structural analysis\nthat we saw him develop for lived experience to the understanding of\nhistory. The human sciences give form to the historical world by\nanalyzing the structural systems in terms of which human beings\nparticipate in history. In the Introduction to the Human\nSciences Dilthey had conceived the psychic nexus, cultural\nsystems and external organizations of society as purposive systems.\nNow a more neutral covering concept is used to capture all the ways\nthe forces of life can converge. This is the concept of the\n\u201cproductive nexus or system\u201d\n(Wirkungszusammenhang). Now the efficacy of life and of the\nhistorical world is to be understood in terms of productivity before\nany causal or teleological analysis is applied. The carriers of\nhistory, whether they be individuals, cultures, institutions, or\ncommunities, are productive systems capable of producing value,\nmeaning, and, in some cases, realizing purposes. Each is to be\nconsidered structurally as centered in itself.\n\nIndividuals can be studied as psychic productive systems inherently\nrelated to each other as well as to more inclusive productive systems\nthat are also at work in history. These larger productive systems come\nabout because of the need for communication, interaction, and\ncooperation among individuals. But they can also take on a life of\ntheir own and survive the individuals that formed and shaped them.\nDilthey\u2019s category of Wirkung or productivity is at the\nroot of Gadamer\u2019s theory of the productive history\n(Wirkungsgeschichte) of works of art that grants them new\nmeanings over time that exceed those intended by their creators. In\nthe Introduction to the Human Sciences, Dilthey had been\nunwilling to consider purposive social systems as subjects or carriers\nof history. In The Formation of the Historical World in the Human\nSciences, he qualifies his opposition to the idea of a\ntranspersonal subject such as the soul of a people by de-reifying it\nas the spirit of a people that is to be considered as a logical rather\nthan a real subject. It is possible to regard cooperative productive\nsystems as logical subjects that transcend individuals without\npositing them as super-empirical real subjects.\n\nDespite this increased importance granted to more encompassing\ncultural systems and organizations of society, Dilthey continues to\ninsist that the individuals participating in them are never completely\nsubmerged by them. This is because any such productive system only\nengages some aspects of an individual. Moreover, the individuals\nactive in a cultural system often put their stamp on its mode of\nproductivity so that not just the rationally agreed upon function of\nthe system is achieved. Summing up these two points, Dilthey discerns\na difficulty in conceptualizing the sciences of these cultural systems\nin terms of the idea of purposes alone:\n\nThe individuals who cooperate in such a function belong to the\ncultural system only through those processes by which they contribute\nto the realization of the function. Nevertheless, they participate in\nthese processes with their whole being, which means that a domain\nbased purely on the system\u2019s functional purpose can never be\nconstructed. Rather, other aspects of human nature are also constantly\nat work in this domain supplementing the energies devoted to the\nsystem\u2019s functions. (1910/SW.III, 208)\n\n\nIndividuals give only part of themselves to these more inclusive\nsystems, yet they can express their whole being through this part. No\ncultural system will embody merely the purposes it was meant to\nfulfill. That is why it is crucial to reconceive purposive systems as\nproductive systems. A productive nexus or system may be purposive in a\ngeneral sense without fulfilling a determinate purpose. It is to be\nunderstood more generally as producing objectifications that express\nhuman values as well as purposes\u2014leaving open the extent to\nwhich specific goals are achieved. The important thing is how human\nvalues and purposes are expressed in productive systems and how their\nmeaning is to be understood.\n\nAs in the essay \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics\u201d, understanding\nwas said to involve a process of referring back from outer sensory\nphenomena to a reality that involves inner processes. But now in\nThe Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences\nDilthey recognizes that this inner reality need not be psychological\nin nature. He uses the example of how the statutes of a state express\nthe common will of a community. The inner content of the laws on the\nbooks is a legal meaning-formation. The expressions we read in law\nbooks articulate an inner relation among legal imperatives. What is\nexpressed in these laws is not the mental states of individual\nlegislators, but a general way of regulating human relations. Dilthey\nmakes the same claim for individual poetic creations. What is\nexpressed in a drama is \n\n\nnot the inner processes in the poet; it is rather a nexus created in\nthem but separable from them. The nexus of a drama consists in a\ndistinctive relation of material, poetic mood, motif, plot, and means\nof presentation. (1910/SW.III, 107)\n\n\nThe interpretation of history must deal with all manifestations of\nlife, not merely expressions that are intended to communicate a state\nof mind. In the section entitled \u201cThe Understanding of Other\nPersons and Their Manifestations of Life\u201d, Dilthey distinguishes\nthree classes of life-manifestations. The first class consists of\nconcepts, judgments and larger thought-formations. They are intended\nto communicate states of affairs, not states of mind. Thus the\nproposition \u201ctwo plus two equals four\u201d means the same in\nall contexts and says nothing about the person uttering it. Actions\nform a second class of manifestations of life. Actions as such are not\nmeant to communicate anything, but they often do reveal something\nabout the intentions of the actor. Thus if someone picks up a hammer\nnearby some nails and wooden boards, it is legitimate to assume that\nhe or she wants to assemble the boards into some artifact. If this\noccurs in a large workshop, it is also plausible to think the person\nis a carpenter. This might also tell us something about the\nperson\u2019s livelihood, but not much more. There is a third class\nof life-manifestations that Dilthey calls \u201cexpressions of lived\nexperience\u201d and which disclose more about the individual\nuttering them. Expressions of lived experience can range from\nemotional exclamations and gestures to personal self-descriptions and\nreflections to works of art. Often these expressions are more\nrevealing than was intended:\n\nAn expression of lived experience can contain more of the nexus of\npsychic life than any introspection can catch sight of. It draws from\ndepths not illuminated by consciousness. But at the same time, it is\ncharacteristic of an expression of lived experience that its relation\nto the spiritual or human content expressed in it can only be made\navailable to understanding within limits. Such expressions are not to\nbe judged as true or false but as truthful or untruthful. (ca.\n1910/SW.III, 227)\n\n\nA work of art is often more disclosive of human life in general than\nof the specific life of the artist. It may disclose something about\nthe state of mind or the attitude of the artist, but a work of art\nwill only be great if its \u201cspiritual content is liberated from\nits creator\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 228).\n\nAfter having analyzed these three kinds of manifestations of life,\nwhich can be called theoretical, practical and disclosive\nrespectively, Dilthey proceeds to distinguish various modes of\nunderstanding them. Elementary understanding goes back to the\nassociative relation that normally exists between an expression and\nwhat is expressed in it. It assimilates the meanings that are commonly\nattached to expressions in the community that we grow up in. Dilthey\nadapts Hegel\u2019s idea of \u201cobjective spirit\u201d to account\nfor this commonality of meaning. Now objective spirit logically\nencompasses \u201cthe manifold forms in which a commonality existing\namong individuals has objectified itself in the world of the\nsenses\u201d, allowing the past to become \u201ca continuously\nenduring present for us\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229). Whereas Hegel\nrestricted objective spirit to the legal, economic and political\naspects of historical life, Dilthey expands the concept to include not\nonly the sciences, but also the triad of art, religion and philosophy\nthat Hegel had assigned to absolute spirit. But most of all, objective\nspirit embodies the everyday, mundane aspects of life that we grow up\nwith.\n\nFrom earliest childhood, the self is nurtured by this world of\nobjective spirit. It is also the medium in which the understanding of\nother persons and their life-manifestations takes place. For\neverything in which spirit has objectified itself contains something\nthat is common to the I and the Thou. Every square planted with trees,\nevery room in which chairs are arranged, is understandable to us from\nchildhood because human tendencies to set goals, produce order, and\ndefine values in common have assigned a place to every square and\nevery object in the room. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 229)\n\n\nThis common background suffices for the elementary understanding of\neveryday life. But whenever the common meaning of life-manifestations\nis called into question for some reason, higher understanding becomes\nnecessary. This can occur because of an apparent inconsistency among\nvarious claims being made, or because an ambiguity that needs to be\nresolved. In each case we discern an unexpected complexity that\nrequires us to shift our frame of reference. Higher understanding\ncannot continue to rely on the common meanings of an expression that\nderive from a shared local background between speaker and listener,\nwriter and reader. Higher understanding must replace the sphere of\ncommonality, where inference by analogy suffices, with that of\nuniversality, where inductive inference must take over. Here the human\nsciences become relevant by offering the appropriate universal\ndisciplinary contexts that can help to deal with uncertainties of\ninterpretation. These universal systematic contexts can be social or\npolitical, economic or cultural, secular or religious. When\nexpressions can be determined to be functioning in a specific\ndisciplinary context then ambiguities tend to disappear. Literary\nscholars may be able to clarify a puzzling poetic passage by showing\nit to contain a literary allusion to a classical work with a foreign\nvocabulary. Or they can perhaps clarify it by seeing it as a way of\naccommodating certain technical demands of the genre as such. These\ncases of higher understanding establish a larger context of\nreference.\n\nHowever, higher understanding can also focus on more specific contexts\nrelated to a work or its author. The consideration of such contexts\nshould come only at the conclusion of the interpretive process and\nrepresents a shift from exploring the relation \u201cof expression to\nwhat is expressed\u201d toward the relation \u201cof what has been\nproduced to productivity\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233). Here we move\nfrom meaning relationships to something like a productive relationship\nto which knowledge about the authors becomes relevant. But the first\nrecourse here is to consult more of the products of the author. How\ndoes a sentence fit into a paragraph, a chapter, a whole work, or a\ncorpus as a whole? Only if these contexts fail to resolve the problem\nmay we consider psychological claims about the author. The\nunderstanding of the individuality of an author should only bring in\npsychological factors as a last resort. Dilthey writes \n\n\nwe understand individuals by means of their affinities, their\ncommonalities. This process presupposes the connection between the\nuniversally human and individuation. On the basis of what is\nuniversal, we can see individuation extended to the manifoldness of\nhuman existence. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 233)\n\n\nHowever, the highest form of understanding is not the reconstruction\nof the individuality of the author. It involves something that has\nbeen confused with reconstruction, but is distinct. What Dilthey\npoints to is a process of re-creation or re-experiencing, which he\ncontrasts with understanding as such: \n\n\nUnderstanding as such is an operation running inverse to the course of\nproduction. But a fully sympathetic reliving requires that\nunderstanding go forward with the line of the events themselves. (ca.\n1910/SW.III, 235)\n\n\nRe-experiencing develops understanding by completing the hermeneutical\ncircle. If understanding goes \u201cback\u201d to the overall\ncontext, re-experiencing goes \u201cforward\u201d by following out\nthe parts that give focus to the whole. A re-experiencing is not an\nactual re-construction but produces a better understanding that\nrefines the original. This is made clear by the following example:\n\n\n\nA lyrical poem makes possible, through the sequence of its verses, the\nre-experiencing of a nexus of lived experience\u2014not the real one\nthat stimulated the poet, but the one that, on its basis, the poet\nplaces in the mouth of an ideal person. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 235)\n\n\nWhereas the arts can expand the horizon of our lived experience by\nmeans of the ideal and imaginary means of fiction, history must do so\nby a process of structural articulation. The task of the human\nsciences is to analyze the productive nexus of history as it exhibits\nitself in stable formations or systematic structures. The productive\nnexus of history differs from the causal nexus of nature in producing\nvalues and arriving at purposes.\n\nThe carriers of this constant creation of values and goods in the\nworld of human spirit are individuals, communities, and the cultural\nsystems in which individuals cooperate. This cooperation is determined\nby the fact that, in order to realize values, individuals subject\nthemselves to rules and set themselves purposes. All these modes of\ncooperation manifest a life-concern connected to the human essence\nthat links individuals with each other\u2014a core, as it were, that\ncannot be grasped psychologically but is revealed in every such system\nof relations among human beings. (1910/SW.III, 175\u201376)\n\n\nEach such socio-cultural system can be regarded as being centered\nwithin itself on the basis of some function, whether it be economic,\nscientific, political, artistic or religious. The structures to be\nanalyzed here provide various cross-sections of what takes place in\nhistory. But there are also more composite and enduring\nsocio-historical contexts that we can delineate such as nation-states\nand historical periods.\n\nA nation-state is a composite institutional organization that contains\nand shapes many socio-cultural productive systems which then generate\ncertain commonalities. When socio-cultural systems transcending the\nscope of a nation come into contact with local productive systems,\nthey also begin to assume commonalities distinctive of that nation. In\nthe individual members of a nation-state these commonalities can\nproduce a sense of solidarity. But Dilthey also warns of excesses in\nthat regard when he notes that many Germans are \u201cplacing the\nhighest value ... not in the serene world-view of the Greeks, not in\nthe intellectually delimited consideration of purpose of the Romans,\nbut in the raw exertion of power without any limit\u201d\n(1910/SW.III, 196).\n\nNation-states are regionally defined historical wholes, but we can\nalso delineate temporal composite wholes such as historical phases.\nWhat characterizes a generation according to Dilthey is the\ncrystallization of a movement sparked by the maturation of a certain\nage group. An epoch is more impersonal and large-scale. It marks a\npervasive \u201cpermeating tendency\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198). Each\nepoch defines a life-horizon by which people orient their life.\n\u201cSuch a horizon places life, life-concerns, life-experience, and\nthought-formation in a certain proportion\u201d (1910/SW.III, 198),\nwhich tends to restrain the way individuals can modify their outlooks.\nBut an epoch is only an overall tendency that encompasses opposing\nforces. In fact, a new epoch will often be sparked by the\ndissatisfactions produced by any force that becomes too dominant and\ncomplacent.\n\nThe structural analysis of history in terms of cultural systems and\nthe external organizations of society can be guided by the various\nhuman sciences. But a reflective mode of judgment is needed when\nhistorians try to make sense of the more composite structures of\nnation-states and epochs. History is both a judgmental art concerned\nwith meaning and a science concerned with objective truth. Only\nhistorical reflection can create the right balance that will transform\nthe conceptual cognition of the human sciences into adequate\nhistorical knowledge.\n2.3.3 The Categories of Historical Knowledge.\n\nThis shift to historical knowledge is the main theme of the notes (ca.\n1910) for a second volume of The Formation of the Historical World\nin the Human Sciences (1910) which were published posthumously in\n1927 as Drafts for a Critique of Historical Reason. Here\nDilthey analyzes the categories of life that are relevant to\nhistorical knowledge. He distinguishes between formal and real\ncategories. Formal categories stem from elementary logical operations\nthat are at work in all apprehension: they include the processes of\ncomparing, noting sameness, differentiating and relating. Although\nsuch elementary operations are prediscursive, they provide the basis\nfor discursive thought. The prediscursive noting of sameness prepares\nthe way for the unifying concepts of discursive thought and the\nprocess of relating provides the basis for synthetic procedures. These\nprediscursive and discursive modes of thought account for the formal\ncategories of unity, plurality, identity, difference, degree and\nrelation that are shared by the natural and human sciences.\n\nBut the real categories are not the same in the natural and human\nsciences. Whereas time is an ideal abstract form for the natural\nsciences, for the human sciences it has a qualitative content. It is\nexperienced as advancing into the future and \u201calways contains\nthe memory of what has just been present\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III,\n216). The relation between the past and the present becomes the source\nfor the category of meaning which is Dilthey\u2019s main historical\ncategory. The present never merely is in the sense of being\nobservable and it can be understood meaningfully only to the extent\nthat the past asserts its presence in it. When the present is\nlived, \u201cthe positive or negative value of the realities that\nfill it are experienced through feeling. And when we face the future,\nthe category of purpose arises through a projective attitude\u201d\n(ca. 1910/SW.III, 222). Meaning, value, and purpose are the three\ncentral categories of the human sciences and each relates to time in\nits own way. What is valued by feeling focuses on the momentary\npresent, but for the will everything in the present tends to be\nsubordinated to some future purpose. Only the category of meaning can\nexpand the present into a presence that includes the past and\novercomes the mere juxtaposition or subordination of the various\naspects of life to each other. The understanding of meaning involves\nthe encompassing sense of reflective knowledge that attempts to relate\ncognition to evaluation and the setting of goals.\n\nDilthey\u2019s distinction between the natural and human sciences is\nnot a metaphysical distinction. For that reason he does not create a\ndualism between nature as the domain of causality and history as the\ndomain of freedom. There are many determining forces at work in\nhistory because it cannot be divorced from natural conditions. But to\nunderstand how individuals participate in history we must replace the\npurely external relation of cause and effect with the integral\nrelation of \u201cagency and suffering, of action and reaction\u201d\n(ca. 1910/SW.III, 219).\n\nThe doing and undergoing that characterizes human involvement in\nhistory can be brought home most forcefully in autobiography. \n\n\nHere a life-course stands as an external phenomenon from which\nunderstanding seeks to discover what produced it within a particular\nenvironment. The person who understands it is the same as the one who\ncreated it. This results in a special intimacy of understanding. (ca.\n1910/SW.III, 221) \n\n\nAutobiography begins with what memory has selected as significant\nlife-moments, which reflection then gives a certain coherence. Thereby\nthe initial tasks of \u201cexplicating a historical nexus are already\nhalf solved by life itself\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 221).\n\nBut the fact that history derives a special intimacy through the\ncapacity for autobiography does not mean that we should be content to\nunderstand history through individuals alone. This also becomes\nevident in relation to Dilthey\u2019s own work as a biographer of\nSchleiermacher. It became ever more clear to Dilthey that his\nbiography could not solve its task of understanding the life of\nSchleiermacher without considering the intellectual life of Berlin in\nwhich he participated. A biography is likely to bring more contextual\ndetermining factors into play than an autobiography, but the\nbiographer must remain open to the interplay of these influences and\nindividual initiative. Dilthey writes that an individual \n\n\ndoes not face a limitless play of forces in the historical world: he\ndwells in the sphere of the state, religion, or science\u2014in\nbrief, in a distinctive life-system or in a constellation of them. The\ninner structure of such a constellation draws the individual into it,\nshapes him, and determines the direction of his productivity.\nHistorical achievements stem from the possibilities inherent in the\ninner structure of a historical moment. (ca. 1910/SW.III,\n266\u201367) \n\n\nIndividuals worthy of a biography are those who have seized those\nmomentary possibilities.\n\nWhen turning to the nexus of universal history, we move further beyond\nthe individual life-courses focused on by autobiography and biography.\nAlthough universal-historical understanding cannot ignore the results\nof autobiography and biography, it will focus more on the history of\nnations, cultural systems, and the external organizations of society.\n\n\n\nEach of these histories has its own center to which the processes are\nrelated and consequently the values, purposes, and significance that\nresult from this relationship. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 291)\n\n\nAnthropological reflection expects history to teach what life is and\nyet history is dependent on life as lived. There is a hermeneutical\ncircularity here that could be escaped \u201cif unconditioned norms,\npurposes, or values [could] set the standard for contemplating an\napprehending history\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 281). Unlike his\nNeo-Kantian contemporaries such as Hermann Cohen and Heinrich Rickert,\nDilthey is not willing to accept unconditional values that transcend\nlife. The spiritual nexus of history \u201cis that of life itself\ninsofar as life produces connectedness under the conditions of its\nnatural environment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 280). Life is the\nultimate context behind which we cannot go. It is the horizon of\nproductivity which encompasses the organic and the mental, but cannot\nbe defined by either. Since \u201clife is intimately related to\ntemporal fulfillment\u201d (ca. 1910/SW.III, 249), historicity is\npart of its essence. Consequently, the objective validity that is to\nbe attached to any value cannot be separated from our temporal\nengagement with life. Values are not simply given or imposed from on\nhigh, but are produced as part of the human process of explicating the\nmeaning of history. In light of Dilthey\u2019s skepticism about\ntranscendent unconditional values, it may seem surprising that he\npresented an ethical system that expects human beings to make\nunconditional commitments that are self-binding.\n",
