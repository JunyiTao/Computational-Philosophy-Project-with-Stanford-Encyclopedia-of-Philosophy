    "main_text": "The Person and his Work\n1. The Person and his Work\n\nTo date there is no reliable information on Petrizi\u2019s dates and\nbiography. According to older Georgian research, he lived in the\nsecond half of the 11th century and the first half of the\n12th century. More recent research, however, tends to date\nhim to the second half of the 12th century. The state of\nresearch is aggravated by the lack of information on Petrizi. The\nlittle personal information that is known about him stems from remarks\nscattered through his works in which Petrizi briefly speaks about\nhimself. In his Proclus commentary\u2014the Interpretation of the\nElementatio theologica of Proclus\u2014and in the\nPostscript, which is traditionally ascribed to him, the\nauthor mentions his own cares and problems.\n\nAccording to authoritative reports, Petrizi translated Nemesius of\nEmesa\u2019s work On the Nature of Man into Georgian\n(Petrizi, Opera II, p. 223). According to these accounts,\nPetrizi encountered numerous difficulties and obstacles put in his way\nby both Greeks and Georgians because of his work. Based on the current\nstate of research on his work and on his biography, together with a\ndetailed study of his Proclus Commentary, Petrizi can be characterized\nas a 12th-century thinker. The character of Georgian\nthought in the 12th century is manifested in his style of\nphilosophizing and in his manner of presenting arguments, in his\nknowledge of ancient philosophy and in his intellectual interest in\nmaintaining ancient thought in its rightful place.\n\nPetrizi names the philosophers whom he treated in his\nInterpretation: Orpheus, Parmenides, Zeno, Plato, Aristotle,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and the Fathers of the Church\n(Petrizi, Opera I, pp. XXVI\u2013LII; Alexidse 1997). He\nheld Platonic philosophy in particularly high esteem. Its\nrepresentatives included in his view both Plato\u2019s predecessors\n(Orpheus, Pythagoras, etc.) and the neo-Platonists. He calls Plato\n\u2018the philosopher of the day\u2019 (Petrizi, Opera I,\np. XXVII). When Petrizi speaks of the \u2018philosopher\u2019, he\nmeans Proclus. By contrast, in the Latin middle ages, the designation\nphilosophus was reserved for Aristotle.\n\nAmong Plato\u2019s works, Petrizi refers to the dialogues\nParmenides, the Laws, Phaedrus, Phaedo and\nTimaeus. Although he does not mention them, he also quotes\nTheaetetus and the Symposium (Petrizi, Opera\nII, pp. 34, 84). Petrizi also mentions various works of\nAristotle\u2019s, but not the pseudo-Aristotelian works used by\nScholastic philosophers (Iremadze 2004a, 57). It can be gathered from\nhis Interpretation that in addition to the Elementatio\ntheologica he also knew other works by Proclus (for example the\nParmenides and Timaeus commentaries as well as the\nPlatonic Theology) and drew on them as he saw fit in\ncommenting on the Elementatio theologica (Iremadze 2004a,\n57).\n",
