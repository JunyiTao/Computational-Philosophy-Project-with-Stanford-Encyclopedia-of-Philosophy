    "main_text": "The CAPS Model || Background\n2.1 Background\n\nWalter Mischel is often hailed as the leader of the situationist\nmovement in psychology, especially in his 1968 book Personality\nand Assessment. But as he notes in a 1973 paper, that book\n\n\nhas been widely misunderstood to imply that people show no\nconsistencies, that individual differences are unimportant, and that\n\u201csituations\u201d are the main determinants of behavior\n(Mischel 1973: 254).\n\n\nIndeed, he writes, it\n\n\nwould be wasteful to create pseudo-controversies that pit person\nagainst situation in order to see which is more important (Mischel\n1973: 255\u2013256).\n\n\nDuring the subsequent decades, he proceeded to develop what came to be\nknown as the CAPS model, along with the help of Yuichi Shoda and Jack\nWright among others (for a leading statement of the model, see Mischel\nand Shoda 1995). Here we focus on just a few features of the model, in\nparticular cognitive-affective units,\nif\u2026then\u2026situation-behavior contingencies,\npsychologically salient features of situations, and intraindividual\nbehavioral signatures.\n2.1.1 Cognitive-Affective Units\n\nCognitive-affective units are the basic building blocks of\nthe CAPS model. They are not global character traits, but rather\nspecific mental states and processes. Here is Mischel\u2019s list\nfrom the 1973 paper (Mischel 1973: 265, 275; for an updated version,\nsee Mischel and Shoda 1995: 252):\n\nBehavior-outcome and stimulus-outcome expectancies in particular\nsituations\nSubjective stimulus values\nSelf-regulatory systems and plans\nConstruction competencies\nEncoding strategies and personal constructs\n\n\nDespite this sophisticated terminology, what Mischel is referring to\nis perfectly familiar. The first item has to do with instrumental\nbeliefs (beliefs about the best means to an end), the second with\ndesires, the third with goals and plans, and the final two with\ngeneral capacities to process incoming information and perform mental\nand physical behaviors (for further discussion, see Mischel 1973,\n1984: 353, 2004: 4\u20135, 11, 2009: 284; Shoda 1999:\n165\u2013171).\n2.1.2 If-Then Situation-Behavior Contingencies\n\nIf-then situation-behavior contingencies are another central\nfeature of the CAPS model. These contingencies are conditional\nstatements representing some facet of an individual\u2019s\npersonality, where the \u201cif\u201d is a situation and the\n\u201cthen\u201d is a behavior. For example, Mischel and his\ncolleagues studied children\u2019s behavior at a summer treatment\ncamp. They found in one case that if a child was teased by a peer,\nthen he would be unlikely to exhibit verbal aggression. The same was\nnot true, though, for another child (for relevant data from this camp,\nsee Mischel 1984: 361\u2013362; Wright and Mischel 1987; and Shoda et\nal. 1993, 1994). This difference can be explained by appealing to\ntheir different cognitive-affective units. Some children might want to\nhurt someone who is teasing them, whereas others may want to run away\n(for more on individual differences in the CAPS model, see Mischel and\nShoda 1995: 253, 1998: 237\u2013240, 2008: 211\u2013212). More\ngenerally, Mischel and Shoda write that,\n\n\nFeatures of situations activate a set of internal reactions\u2014not\njust cognitive but also affective\u2014based on the\nindividual\u2019s prior experience with those features (Mischel and\nShoda 1995: 251).\n\n\nAnd those reactions can lead to subsequent behavior.\n2.1.3 Nominal versus Psychologically Salient Features of Situations\n\nThis distinction is always taken to be central to CAPS, and figures\nprominently in the recent philosophical literature on character (for\ntwo examples, see Russell 2009: chapters 8 to 10; Snow 2010: chapter\n1). Psychologically salient features are defined as:\n\n\nthe features of the situation that have significant meaning for a\ngiven individual or type, and that are related to the experienced\npsychological situation\u2014the thoughts and affects and goals that\nbecome activated within the personality system (Mischel 2004: 15).\n\n\nNominal characteristics are defined as more generic features that\nthird party observers would use in describing a situation, such as the\nphysical location, time, or event. Examples include being at the\nbowling alley, eating lunch, doing taxes, talking on the computer with\nSmith, and watching a movie (this distinction is related to the\ntechnical terminology in psychology of idiographic versus nomothetic\napproaches. Very roughly, idiographic approaches use criteria supplied\nby the participant in question, whereas nomothetic approaches use\ncriteria supply by individuals besides the participant. For careful\ndiscussion, see Lamiell 1997).\n\nThe idea is that situations might seem very different to observers on\nthe basis of their nominal features, but to the person in question\nthere could be important similarities (or vice versa). For\ninstance, a person could perceive criticism of himself at the bowling\nalley and the office, and use the same defensive strategies in both\ncases even though they might seem to be so different in other\nrespects. The more general lesson is that psychologists need to pay\nattention to both nominal and psychologically salient features of\nsituations when studying personality.\n2.1.4 Intraindividual Behavioral Signatures\n\nPutting all these pieces together, we can introduce the next component\nof the CAPS model, the intraindividual behavioral signature.\nRather than focusing on the individual\u2019s behavior in just one\nsituation, the behavioral signature depicts her pattern of behavior\nacross multiple situations. And what individuates the situations is\ntheir psychologically relevant features. For instance, Mischel and\ncolleagues came up with behavioral signatures for the children at the\nsummer camp, by examining their aggressive behavior across situations\nsuch as peer teasing, \u201cwhen approached by a peer\u201d, and\n\u201cwhen warned by an adult counselor\u201d (Shoda 1999: 160). Not\nsurprisingly, the children tended to behave differently from one\nsituation to the next. Thus the CAPS model,\n\n\npredicts that the person\u2019s behavior in a domain will change from\none situation to another\u2014when the if changes, so will\nthe then\u2014even if the personality system were to remain\nentirely unchanged (Mischel and Shoda 1995: 257, emphasis theirs).\n\n\n(For more on behavioral signatures, see Shoda et al. 1994:\n675\u2013678, Mischel and Shoda 1995: 249, 251, 255, 258, 1998: 242,\n245, 2008: 208, 224, 228, 233.)\n\nLet me stop the presentation of CAPS at this point, although there is\nmuch more to the view. Mischel offers a helpful summary of what we\nhave covered thus far:\n\n\nAs the person experiences situations that contain different\npsychological features, different [cognitive-affective units] and\ntheir characteristic interrelationships become activated in relation\nto these features. Consequently, the activation of\n[cognitive-affective units] changes from one time to another and from\none situation to another\u2026Although cognitions and affects that\nare activated at a given time change, how they change, that\nis, the sequence and pattern of their activation, remains stable,\nreflecting the stable structure of the organization within the system.\nThe result is a distinctive pattern of\nif\u2026then\u2026relations, or behavioral signatures,\nmanifested as the individual moves across different situations (2004:\n11, emphasis his).\n\n\nWith this in mind, let us now turn to some of the philosophical\nimplications.\n",
