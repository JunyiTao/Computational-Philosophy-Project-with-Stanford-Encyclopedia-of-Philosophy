    "main_text": "Argumentation Across Fields of Inquiry and Social Practices || Language and communication\n4.4 Language and communication\n\nArgumentation is primarily (though not exclusively) a linguistic\nphenomenon. Accordingly, argumentation is extensively studied in\nfields dedicated to the study of language, such as rhetoric,\nlinguistics, discourse analysis, communication, and pragmatics, among\nothers (see Eemeren, Garssen, et al. 2014: chs 8 and 9). Researchers\nin these areas develop general theoretical models of argumentation and\ninvestigate concrete instances of argumentation in specific domains on\nthe basis of linguistic corpora, discourse analysis, and other methods\nused in the language sciences (see the edited volume Oswald, Herman,\n& Jacquin [2018] for a sample of the different lines of research).\nOverall, research on argumentation within the language sciences tends\nto focus primarily on concrete occurrences of arguments in a variety\nof domains, adopting a largely descriptive rather than normative\nperspective (though some of these researchers also tackle normative\nconsiderations).\n\nSome of these analyses approach arguments and argumentation primarily\nas text or self-contained speeches, while others emphasize the\ninterpersonal, communicative nature of \u201cface-to-face\u201d\nargumentation (see Eemeren, Garssen, et al. 2014: section 8.9). One\nprominent approach in this tradition is due to communication scholars\nSally Jackson and Scott Jacobs. They have drawn on speech act theory\nand conversation analysis to investigate argumentation as a\ndisagreement-relevant expansion of speech acts that, through mutually\nrecognized reasons, allows us to manage disagreements despite the\nchallenges they pose for communication and coordination of activities\n(Jackson & Jacobs 1980; Jackson 2019). Moreover, they perceive\ninstitutionalized practices of argumentation and concrete\n\u201cargumentation designs\u201d\u2014such as for example\nrandomized controlled trials in medicine\u2014as interventions aimed\nat improving methods of disagreement management through\nargumentation.\n\nAnother communication scholar, Dale Hample, has further argued for the\nimportance of approaching argumentation as an essentially\ninterpersonal communicative activity (Hample 2006, 2018). This\nperspective allows for the consideration of a broader range of\nfactors, not only the arguments themselves but also (and primarily)\nthe people involved in those processes: their motivations,\npsychological processes, and emotions. It also allows for the\nformulation of questions pertaining to individual as well as cultural\ndifferences in argumentative styles (see\n section 5.3\n below).\n\nAnother illuminating perspective views argumentative practices as\ninherently tied to broader socio-cultural contexts (Amossy 2009). The\nJournal of Argumentation in Context was founded in 2012\nprecisely to promote a contextual approach to argumentation. Once\nargumentation is no longer only considered in abstraction from\nconcrete instances taking place in real-life situations, it becomes\nimperative to recognize that argumentation does not take place in a\nvacuum; typically, argumentative practices are embedded in other kinds\nof practices and institutions, against the background of specific\nsocio-cultural, political structures. The method of discourse analysis\nis particularly suitable for a broader perspective on argumentation,\nas shown by the work of Ruth Amossy (2002) and Marianne Doury (2009),\namong others.\n",
