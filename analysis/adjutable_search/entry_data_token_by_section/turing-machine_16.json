Instead of a one-way infinite tape,\nPost\u2019s \u2018machine\u2019 consists of a two-way infinite\nsymbol space divided into boxes. The idea is that a worker is working\nin this symbol space, being capable of a set of five primitive acts\n(\\(O_{1}\\) mark a box, \\(O_{2}\\) unmark a box, \\(O_{3}\\) move one box\nto the left, \\(O_{4}\\) move one box to the right, \\(O_{5}\\)\ndetermining whether the box he is in is marked or unmarked), following\na finite set of directions \\(d_{1}\\),\u2026, \\(d_{n}\\) where each\ndirection \\(d_{i}\\) always has one of the following forms:\n\nPerform one of the operations (\\(O_{1}\\)\u2013\\(O_4\\)) and go to\ninstruction \\(d_{j}\\)\nPerform operation \\(O_{5}\\) and according as the box the worker is\nin is marked or unmarked follow direction \\(d_{j'}\\) or\n\\(d_{j''}\\).\nStop.\n\n\nPost also defined a specific terminology for his formulation 1 in\norder to define the solvability of a problem in terms of formulation\n1. These notions are applicability, finite-1-process, 1-solution and\n1-given. Roughly speaking these notions assure that a decision problem\nis solvable with formulation 1 on the condition that the solution\ngiven in the formalism always terminates with a correct solution.\n",
