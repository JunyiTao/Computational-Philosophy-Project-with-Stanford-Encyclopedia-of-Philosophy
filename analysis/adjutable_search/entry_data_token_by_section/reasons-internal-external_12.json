    "main_text": "Direct, Extensional Arguments || Relative Explanatory Power\n4. The Debate Today\n\n\nThe debate over internal and external reasons is very much alive\ntoday, open on nearly all of the fronts that we have considered in this\narticle. Or more accurately, we should say that the\ndebates over internal and external reasons are very much alive\ntoday. As we saw, there are important differences between State\nand Motivation forms of internalism, between Counterfactual and Actual\nforms of internalism, and between versions that give rise to the\nCentral Problem and those that do not. There are also important\nfurther differences in precisely how to formulate any given version of\nreasons internalism, and we have not precisely formulated any single\nversion in this article.\n\n\nWhat is clear is that there are two main varieties of internalist\nview, each of which faces its own class of problems. Most\ninternalist views encounter the Central Problem, and hence have\ndifficulty in allowing for some of the important reasons that we\npre-theoretically are inclined to think that there are. Though\nother arguments have been offered against them, this challenge is at\nthe heart of their difficulties. We saw that some Counterfactual\nversions of internalism avoid the Central Problem, by claiming that the\nrelevant counterfactuals are not grounded in any features of agents\u2019\nactual psychologies, but rather are explained in some other way.\nThe challenge facing these views is to provide such an explanation\nwithout collapsing into triviality, as with the view that the relevant\ncounterfactual condition is \u2018that the agent is motivated by all\nof her reasons\u2019.\n\n\nExternalist views, on the other hand, avoid the Central Problem and\nhence do well with moral reasons, but critics worry that external\nreasons are more mysterious, and that such theories cannot provide as\nattractive an explanation of why some reasons do\nappear to be internal. An attractive way forward may have to show\nentrenched parties how to achieve some of the important advantages of\neach side of the debate.\n",
