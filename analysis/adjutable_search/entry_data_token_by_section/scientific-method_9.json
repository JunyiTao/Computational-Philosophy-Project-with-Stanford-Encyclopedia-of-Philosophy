Such references to a universal scientific method can be\nfound in educational material at all levels of science education\n(Blachowicz 2009), and numerous studies have shown that the idea of a\ngeneral and universal scientific method often form part of both\nstudents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 conception of science (see, e.g.,\nAikenhead 1987; Osborne et al. 2003). In response, it has been argued\nthat science education need to focus more on teaching about the nature\nof science, although views have differed on whether this is best done\nthrough student-led investigations, contemporary cases, or historical\ncases (Allchin, Andersen & Nielsen 2014)\n\nAlthough occasionally phrased with reference to the H-D method,\nimportant historical roots of the legend in science education of a\nsingle, universal scientific method are the American philosopher and\npsychologist Dewey\u2019s account of inquiry in How We Think\n(1910) and the British mathematician Karl Pearson\u2019s account of\nscience in Grammar of Science (1892). On Dewey\u2019s\naccount, inquiry is divided into the five steps of\n\n\n(i) a felt difficulty, (ii) its location and definition, (iii)\nsuggestion of a possible solution, (iv) development by reasoning of\nthe bearing of the suggestions, (v) further observation and experiment\nleading to its acceptance or rejection. (Dewey 1910: 72)\n\n\nSimilarly, on Pearson\u2019s account, scientific investigations start\nwith measurement of data and observation of their correction and\nsequence from which scientific laws can be discovered with the aid of\ncreative imagination. These laws have to be subject to criticism, and\ntheir final acceptance will have equal validity for \u201call\nnormally constituted minds\u201d. Both Dewey\u2019s and\nPearson\u2019s accounts should be seen as generalized abstractions of\ninquiry and not restricted to the realm of science\u2014although both\nDewey and Pearson referred to their respective accounts as \u2018the\nscientific method\u2019.\n\nOccasionally, scientists make sweeping statements about a simple and\ndistinct scientific method, as exemplified by Feynman\u2019s\nsimplified version of a conjectures and refutations method presented,\nfor example, in the last of his 1964 Cornell Messenger\n lectures.[6]\n However, just as often scientists have come to the same conclusion as\nrecent philosophy of science that there is not any unique, easily\ndescribed scientific method. For example, the physicist and Nobel\nLaureate Weinberg described in the paper \u201cThe Methods of Science\n\u2026 And Those By Which We Live\u201d (1995) how\n\n\nThe fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does\nnot only make the philosophy of science difficult; it also raises\nproblems for the public understanding of science. We do not have a\nfixed scientific method to rally around and defend. (1995: 8)\n\n\nInterview studies with scientists on their conception of method shows\nthat scientists often find it hard to figure out whether available\nevidence confirms their hypothesis, and that there are no direct\ntranslations between general ideas about method and specific\nstrategies to guide how research is conducted (Schickore & Hangel\n2019, Hangel & Schickore 2017)\n",
