A theory which characterizes inner\nspeech this way has been developed at length in psychology, primarily\nby Charles Fernyhough (e.g., 1996, 2008, 2009). However, the\nsuggestion has been made in a variety of ways by philosophers as well,\nincluding by Machery (2018), Frankish (2018), Gauker (2018), and\nWilkinson, in collaboration with Fernyhough (Wilkinson &\nFernyhough 2018).\n\nThe idea that inner speech involves an internal dialogue or\nconversation clearly has intuitive appeal for some. One often finds\ninner speech described outside the philosophical context as the\n\u201cinner dialogue\u201d. But, if inner speech involves a kind of\ninternal dialogue or conversation on more than a metaphorical level,\nthen it is natural to wonder who the interlocutors are (Gregory\n2020a). Machery (2018) and Frankish (2018) suggest that different\nparts of the brain communicate with one another via inner speech.\nGauker (2018) suggests that inner speech involves conversing with\noneself (see also the discussion of inner speech as a means for\ninteraction between subsystems or modules in the mind in\n Section 2.2).\n One difficulty with both of these suggestions, however, is that\nphilosophers of language generally (though not universally) think of\nconversation as fundamentally involving distinct human agents.\n\nGregory (2017) appeals to Grice\u2019s (1975 [2013]) account of\nconversation to make this point. Grice argued that conversations are\n\u201ccharacteristically \u2026 cooperative efforts\u201d (p.\n314). But cooperation requires multiple agents and there is only one\nagent in inner speech. That said, Gauker (2011, 2018) is working with\nan explicitly non-Gricean picture of conversation, motivated by an\nopposition to the doctrine that speech acts serve to express thoughts\nthat are distinct from and precede the expressive utterance. He holds\nthat speaking is,\n\n\nin the first instance, something we do whenever there is no reason not\nto, because of the good it tends to do. (2018: 71)\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, where multiple individuals are present,\n\n\n[a] conversation can be the occasion for each interlocutor to reflect\non what he or she has experienced, \u2026 and on that basis to\nelicit a statement that is useful from the other. (2018: 72)\n\n\nInsofar as we can generate inner speech episodes which cause us to\nreflect on some matter and then produce further inner speech episodes\nwhich are useful for us in the context, inner speech will be\nconversational. Gauker\u2019s analysis here obviously reflects the\nexpression-oriented approach to the question of whether there can be\nspeech acts in inner speech.\n\nIn contrast to Gauker, Deamer (2021) argues that inner speech can be\nseen as being communicative in a Gricean sense. She holds that, to at\nleast some extent, humans are \u201cself-blind\u201d: mental states\nsuch as our intentions are not always transparent to us. When we\nproduce inner speech, we reveal our communicative intentions to\nourselves, just as we reveal our communicative intentions to others\nwhen we converse with them.\n\nWhile there is disagreement as to whether a series of inner speech\nepisodes can be a dialogue in a literal sense, most agree that inner\nspeech often closely resembles dialogue. As Gauker notes, one episode\nof inner speech will often prompt another, as happens in interpersonal\ndialogue. We can produce episodes of inner speech corresponding to\ndifferent points of view, e.g., when thinking about the considerations\nfor and against some course of action, in a way similar to two people\nwith different opinions. Some participants in studies report that some\nof their inner speech episodes take place in the voices of others\n(McCarthy-Jones & Fernyhough 2011; Alderson-Day, Mitrenga, et al.\n2018). This last consideration raises an important issue. We can\ncertainly imagine conversing with others and we can certainly imagine\nothers conversing. Such cases are usually taken to be distinct from\ninner speech (see\n Section 1).\n However, if inner speech can involve the voices of others, possibly\nexpressing viewpoints other than our own, it becomes difficult to say\nhow instances of inner speech with these characteristics differ from\ncases of imagining others speaking. How to delineate the extension of\n\u201cinner speech\u201d in a way that distinguishes inner speech\nacts from cases of (merely) imagining speech remains an underexplored\nissue.\n5. Self-Knowledge and Metacognition\n\nInner speech plays an important role in a number of philosophical\naccounts of self-knowledge and metacognition. By\n\u201cself-knowledge\u201d we will mean knowledge of one\u2019s own\nmental states, including both dispositional states\u2014like beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions\u2014and occurrent states, such as thoughts,\nimaginings, decisions, and judgments. The notion of metacognition is\nsomewhat broader, also encompassing judgments and non-cognitive\nassessments (e.g., \u201cfeelings of knowing\u201d) concerning the\nvalidity of one\u2019s own reasoning, the quality of one\u2019s\nevidence, one\u2019s degree of certainty, and so on (Proust 2013).\nWhile some theorists implicate inner speech in their accounts of both\nself-knowledge and metacognition (Jackendoff 1996; Clark 1998;\nBerm\u00fadez 2003, 2018), others focus more narrowly on the\nquestion of how inner speech might facilitate self-knowledge (Byrne\n2018; Carruthers 2011; Roessler 2016). A common thread among theorists\nwho invoke inner speech in their accounts of metacognition or\nself-knowledge is the idea that certain others of our mental\nstates\u2014namely, those that our inner speech helps us to know\nabout\u2014are either less readily available to introspection or less\nwell suited to serve a metacognitive role. Thus, these views all\nappear against a backdrop of broader commitments about the nature of\nmental states and our introspective access to them.\n5.1 Metacognitive Approaches\n\nOne approach sees inner speech as especially well suited to aid in\nmetacognition due to its linguistic structure, or its link to public\nlanguage more generally. According to Andy Clark (1998), the fact that\ninner speech occurs in a language\u2014where such language is seen as\nabstracting away from the particularities of perception\u2014allows\nit to play a special role in \u201csecond-order cognitive\ndynamics\u201d (see also Prinz 2011, 2012). This, he holds, is\nbecause the natural language sentences featured in inner speech are\n\u201ccontext resistant\u201d and \u201cmodality\ntranscending\u201d in ways that facilitate a more objective and\nreliable assessment of the soundness of one\u2019s own thought\nprocesses (Clark 1998: 178). Berm\u00fadez (2003, 2018) builds on\nClark\u2019s proposal, specifying that awareness of inner speech is\nessential for enabling humans to become conscious of their own\npropositional thought processes, which are otherwise amodal and\ninaccessible to introspection. According to Berm\u00fadez,\n\n\nall the propositional thoughts that we consciously introspect\n\u2026 take the form of sentences in a public language. (emphasis\noriginal, 2003: 159\u2013160)\n\n\nWhile he does not identify these public language sentences with our\ncore thought processes themselves\u2014these, he holds, occur in a\nsubconscious language of thought\u2014Berm\u00fadez argues that the\nlinguistic structure of inner speech is needed to adequately represent\nthe relationships of entailment and rational support that may (or may\nnot) exist among the subconscious thoughts the inner speech episodes\nserve to express. As he puts it,\n\n\nwe think about thoughts through thinking about the sentences through\nwhich those thoughts might be expressed. (2003: 164)\n\n\nJackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011, 2012) and Prinz (2011, 2012) likewise\nhold that there is a level of conceptual thought that is not directly\navailable to introspection and that inner speech is well suited for\nmaking us aware of such thoughts. Yet, for Jackendoff and Prinz, inner\nspeech is able to play this role primarily because, like other\nimagistic mental states, inner speech occurs at an\n\u201cintermediate\u201d level of representation, which, on their\ntheories, is the only level of representation at which mental states\nare consciously available to the subject. Thus Jackendoff\u2019s\ncomment that \u201cwe are aware of our thinking because we hear the\nassociated sounds in our heads\u201d (2011: 613). Echoing\nBerm\u00fadez and Clark, Prinz finds it\n\n\nlikely that we often come to know what we are thinking by hearing\ninner statements of the sentences that we would use to express our\nthoughts (2011:. 186)\n\n\nand judges inner speech to be \u201ca way of registering complex\nthoughts in consciousness\u201d (2011: 186). (See also Machery 2005,\n2018.)\n5.2 Inferentialist Approaches\n\nSeveral theorists, who we will term \u201cinferentialists\u201d,\nfollow Ryle (1949 [2009]) in his claim that we often come to know what\nwe are thinking by \u201coverhear[ing]\u201d, or\n\u201ceavesdrop[ping] on \u2026 our own silent monologues\u201d\n(1949 [2009: 165]). On these views, we come to know what we are\nthinking, or what we believe or desire, by drawing a kind of inference\n(the nature of which differs, depending on the theorist) from the fact\nthat we \u201chear\u201d ourselves say something in inner speech.\nThe views of Clark, Berm\u00fadez, Jackendoff, and Prinz, already\nreviewed, are inferentialist in nature. Yet there are other approaches\nthat incorporate inner speech into a process that is even more\nexplicitly inferential.\n\nCarruthers (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018) is an inferentialist of this\nlatter sort. While, in earlier work, he argued that thought itself\noccurs in inner speech (Carruthers 2002), Carruthers later abandoned\nthat idea to hold that thoughts (including one\u2019s beliefs) are\nalways unconscious. On this view, inner speech episodes remain more or\nless directly available to introspection, yet only provide a kind of\nindirect evidence for what we are in fact judging or deciding (or\nbelieving, desiring, or intending) unconsciously. He emphasizes the\nfallible nature of such inferences, arguing on the basis of various\nempirical studies that many of the inferences people arrive at about\ntheir own beliefs and desires are in fact incorrect. Similarly to\nJackendoff and Prinz, Carruthers holds that only sensory states are\nable to serve as inputs to the mental mechanism responsible for self-\n(and other-) directed mindreading. These inputs include visual and\nother forms of sensory imagery in addition to inner speech. However,\nin cases where we are having thoughts about abstract matters that are\ndifficult to unambiguously represent with other forms of\nimagery\u2014such as the thought that philosophy is a challenging\nsubject\u2014episodes of inner speech are held to provide an\nespecially important source of information that one is having such\nthoughts. Carruthers emphasizes that the process becomes especially\ninferential in nature where other contextual information\u2014such as\nthat one sees oneself lingering over a choice of cereal\nbox\u2014combines with one\u2019s inner speech to generate an\nall-things-considered appraisal of what one is currently judging or\ndeciding. Cassam (2011, 2014) likewise implicates inner speech in a\nmulti-faceted inferentialist account of self-knowledge, though not\npitched in terms of \u201cmindreading\u201d mechanisms or other\nconstructs from cognitive science.\n\nAlex Byrne (2011, 2018) puts inner speech to somewhat different ends\nin his inferentialist account of how we know what we are thinking. For\nByrne, there is no such thing as inner speech, strictly speaking,\nbecause there are no sounds (or voices) in the head. However, there\nare such things as auditory-phonological representations of voices.\nThese give rise to an apparent perception of what we come to think of\nas the \u201cinner voice\u201d. By trying to attend to what the\ninner voice says, Byrne proposes, we can reliably form judgments about\nwhat we are thinking. The epistemic rule he proposes for doing so\nis:\n\n\nTHINK: If the inner voice speaks about x, believe that you\nare thinking about x.\n\n\nAs with Carruthers, a key motivation for Byrne\u2019s account of how\nwe know what we are thinking is a background view\u2014motivated by\nthe work of Shoemaker (1994), Dretske (2003), and others\u2014that we\nhave no other, more direct introspective method for knowing our own\nthoughts (i.e., we lack something like an \u201cinner sense\u201d).\nNote that Byrne\u2019s approach is inferentialist in that he takes\ninner speech to be implicated in inferences that lead to knowledge of\none\u2019s own occurrent thoughts. Yet the sort of inference involved\nis quite different from that envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam, who\nboth hold that inner speech episodes are just one kind of information\namong many that may be brought to bear in inferences about one\u2019s\nstanding and occurrent mental states. Importantly, the form of\ninference envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam is essentially the same\nin its first and third person applications, whereas Byrne\u2019s\nTHINK rule is of an inferential procedure that can only be used to\nreliably generate true beliefs about one\u2019s own mental states. In\nByrne\u2019s view, this helps to explain the \u201cpeculiar\u201d\nnature of introspection, where this peculiarity lies in the fact that\nour methods for knowing our own mental states are (intuitively)\ndifferent from those we use to know others\u2019 (Byrne 2011, 2018).\nFurther, on Byrne\u2019s version of inferentialism, the inferences we\nform by trying to follow THINK are extremely likely to amount to\nknowledge\u2014thereby cohering with the intuition that knowledge of\none\u2019s own current thoughts is epistemically privileged. Whereas,\nthe kinds of metacognitive inferences that Carruthers and Cassam\nenvision to rely on inner speech are (by their own telling)\nepistemically on a par with our inferences about the mental states of\nothers and far more susceptible to error.\n5.3 Inferentialism\u2019s Critics\n\nSeveral philosophers object that inferentialist proposals leave us at\ntoo great an epistemic distance from our own thoughts (Bar-On &\nOchs 2018; Roessler 2016) or have other unworkable features\n(Langland-Hassan 2014; Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010;\nRoessler 2016). Roessler (2016) pursues a non-observational account of\nthe role of inner speech in generating self-knowledge. Rejecting the\nidea that we need to \u201ceavesdrop on ourselves\u201d by attending\nto our inner speech, Roessler suggests we follow remarks of Ryle (1949\n[2009]) and Anscombe (1957) in understanding the knowledge gained\nthrough inner speech as a kind of \u201cpractical knowledge\u201d,\n(or, for Ryle, \u201cserial knowledge\u201d), where knowing what one\nis thinking is understood as a special case of knowing what one is\ndoing.\n\nBar-On & Ochs (2018) likewise take aim at what they term\n\u201cNeo-Rylean\u201d invocations of inner speech, arguing that\nByrne\u2019s THINK rule fails to identify a special role for inner\nspeech in facilitating self-knowledge. Drawing on Bar-On\u2019s\n(2004) broader expressivist approach to self-knowledge, Bar-On and\nOchs hold that a proper account of inner speech\u2019s role in\nself-knowledge should show how such knowledge is \u201cdistinctive\nand uniquely first-personal\u201d in that it is\n\n\nknowledge that one can be said to have in virtue of being in a\nprivileged position to give direct voice to one\u2019s thoughts.\n(2018: 20)\n\n\nThey do not, however, develop a positive account in detail.\n\nVicente & Mart\u00ednez-Manrique (2005, 2008;\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010) have criticized\nBerm\u00fadez\u2019s and related inferentialist views on the\ngrounds that the semantics of natural language sentences\u2014and\ninner speech episodes, in particular\u2014are underdetermined in ways\nincompatible with providing knowledge of one\u2019s thoughts. For\ninstance, the sentence \u201cJane\u2019s cup is full\u201d, is\nambiguous in several ways, including the sense in which it is\nJane\u2019s cup (does she own it? is she just using it? is it the one\nshe merely wants?) and the sense in which it is full (is it full of\nair? of liquid? of coins?). If the explicit meaning of a sentence is\nonly extracted (and disambiguated) at the level of thought itself,\nthey argue, it is unclear how awareness of semantically indeterminate\ninner speech utterances could suffice for awareness of one\u2019s\nown\u2014presumably explicit and unambiguous\u2014propositional\nthoughts. Berm\u00fadez replies in his 2018 paper.\n\nJorba & Vicente (2014) and Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente\n(2015) criticize what they call the \u201cformat view\u201d of inner\nspeech (which they attribute to Jackendoff and others) which holds\nthat we are conscious of our inner speech episodes only because of\ntheir sensory format (see also Fern\u00e1ndez Castro 2016). If these\ncriticisms succeed, they cast doubt on views, such as those of\nCarruthers (2010), Jackendoff (1996), and Prinz (2012), which link the\nmetacognitive or introspective value of inner speech to its occurrence\nin a sensory format.\n\nLangland-Hassan (2014) raises a different sort of challenge for\ninferentialist views. Recall that it is a common assumption of those\nviews that propositional thought itself is amodal (i.e., non-sensory)\nand non-conscious. For theorists such as Carruthers, Prinz,\nJackendoff, and Berm\u00fadez, inner speech is a conscious mental\nprocess just because it has sensory features that render it the sort\nof state that is apt to be conscious. Langland-Hassan argues that\nthere is a conflict in holding that an episode of inner speech is a\nsingle mental state with both sensory features (relating to the\nrepresentation of phonemes) and semantic features (relating to the\nmeanings of the corresponding words). If this criticism is correct, it\ncreates problems for the proposal that inner speech is especially well\nsuited (due to its sensory character) to serve as input to inferences\nabout one\u2019s non-conscious mental states. Berm\u00fadez (2018),\nCarruthers (2018), and Munroe (2023) have articulated different ways\nof responding to this challenge (see also Prinz 2011 for relevant\nremarks).\n6. Auditory Verbal Hallucinations and Inserted Thoughts\n\nInner speech features prominently in philosophical and cognitive\nscientific discussions of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and\nthought insertion. Both are common symptoms of schizophrenia but can\noccur in other contexts (e.g., brain injury, drug use) as well. AVHs\nare hallucinatory experiences of another\u2019s speech, while thought\ninsertion is understood either as a non-veridical experience of having\nsomeone else\u2019s thoughts in one\u2019s mind (Wing et al. 1990),\nor simply as the delusional belief that someone else\u2019s thoughts\nare in one\u2019s mind (Andreasen 1984). Two central questions\nexplored by theorists are, first, whether (abnormal) inner speech is\nindeed the basis of AVHs or thought insertion, and, second, what might\nlead an episode of inner speech to be experienced as an AVH or\ninserted thought.\n\nOn the first question, an initially plausible approach to AVHs is to\nhold that they are more a matter of hallucinatory speech\nperception than of (unwitting) speech production, and thus\nnot well conceived as episodes of inner speech. Wu (2012) and Cho\n& Wu (2013, 2014) advance a theory of this kind, holding that AVHs\nresult from the spontaneous activation of speech perception areas in\nthe brain. On their account, inner speech\u2014and, in particular,\nthe neural regions implicated in speech production\u2014are not\nimplicated in AVHs. Despite the attractive simplicity of this account,\nmost researchers have pursued options that explicitly involve inner\nspeech, for several reasons. First, in formal surveys, patients often\nreport that the phenomenological characteristics of their AVHs are\ndifferent from those of hearing speech, insofar as their AVHs are not\nas subjectively \u201cloud\u201d as cases of hearing speech, are not\nequally rich in sensory features, and do not always seem to emanate\nfrom outside the head (Stephens & Graham 2000; Hoffman et al.\n2008; Laroi et al. 2012; Nayani & David 1996; Stephane 2019). It\nappears that an explanation of the seemingly \u201calien\u201d\nnature of these episodes, as well as of thought insertion, will\nrequire some other apparatus than an appeal to perception-like\nphenomenology. Given the need for such an alternative, one may hope to\nextend it also to cases of AVHs that are reported as having rich,\nperception-like phenomenological features (Langland-Hassan 2008;\nMoseley & Wilkinson 2014).\n\nSecond, neuroimaging has shown activation in both language perception\nand language production areas when patients are experiencing\nAVHs (Allen, Aleman, & Mcguire 2007; Allen, Modinos, et al. 2012;\nBohlken, Hugdahl, & Sommer 2017). Here as in other areas of the\nstudy of inner speech, it is important to recognize that the neural\nregions underlying speech production (such as Broca\u2019s area, in\nthe left inferior frontal gyrus) are distinct from those governing\nspeech perception (such as Wernicke\u2019s area, in the superior\ntemporal gyrus). This is why damage to one area but not the other (as\nin some cases of stroke) can result in markedly different language\nimpairments. The fact that the mechanisms governing speech production\nand perception are dissociable in these ways provides an important\nmeans for assessing whether AVHs are best viewed as productive or\nperceptual (or both) in nature.\n\nNevertheless, those who see abnormal inner speech episodes as the\nbasis for AVHs or thought insertion face a difficult task in\nexplaining what would lead a person to not identify their own inner\nspeech as their own, or to not feel in control of their own inner\nspeech. Some have offered content-based explanations, where it is some\nfeature of the semantic content of the inner speech that leads a\nperson to disown it. For instance, Stephens and Graham (2000) argue\nthat a patient may disown inner speech episodes with contents that are\n\u201cintentionally inexplicable\u201d, in the sense that they are\nnot easily accommodated within a coherent self-narrative (see also\nRoessler (2013), Sollberger (2014), Bortolotti & Broome (2009),\nand Fern\u00e1ndez (2010) on the idea that AVHs or inserted thoughts\nare episodes with contents the patient is unwilling to endorse).\nChallenges for this approach are patient reports of voices that are\nhelpful or encouraging. As the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler notes\nin early work on people with schizophrenia, \u201cbesides their\npersecutors, the patients often hear the voice of some\nprotector\u201d, and, occasionally, the hallucinatory voices\n\u201crepresent sound criticism of the [the patient\u2019s]\ndelusional thoughts and pathological drives\u201d (1911 [1950:\n98]).\n\nA popular alternative approach\u2014sometimes known as the\n\u201ccomparator\u201d or \u201csensory feedback\u201d\napproach\u2014builds on work in cognitive neuroscience concerning the\nmechanisms by which bodily movements are determined to be one\u2019s\nown (Feinberg 1978; Frith 1992; Miall et al. 1993; Wolpert, Miall\n& Kawato 1998). The basic idea behind these approaches is that,\nbelow the level of consciousness, the brain is continually generating\npredictions about the likely sensory consequences of planned actions,\nwhich are then compared with actual sensory feedback. When there is a\nmismatch between the prediction and sensory feedback, one may have the\nphenomenological sense of not being in control of one\u2019s actions\n(Frith 2012). A number of authors have proposed that the generation of\nboth inner and outer speech may be attended by the same kind of\nprediction and comparison mechanisms, and that the malfunctioning of\nthese mechanisms could lead to one\u2019s own inner speech seeming\nnot to be in one\u2019s control (Blakemore, Smith, et al. 2000;\nCampbell 1999; Langland-Hassan 2016; Proust 2006). These proposals\nderive some support from the fact that people with schizophrenia have\nbeen shown to have broader deficits in automatically anticipating and\nadjusting for the sensory consequences of their own actions\n(Blakemore, Smith et al. 2000; Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith\n1998).\n\nNevertheless, the comparator approach to AVHs and thought insertion\nhas come in for criticism on several grounds (Synofzik, Vosgerau &\nNewen 2008; Vicente 2014; Vosgerau & Newen 2007). One complaint\nhas been that the lack of sensory features associated with inserted\nthoughts, in particular, makes sensory-feedback approaches ill-suited\nto their explanation (Vosgerau & Newen 2007). In response, some\ndefenders have shifted to pitching the thesis in terms of predictive\nprocessing models of perception and action (Gerrans 2015; Swiney 2018;\nSwiney & Sousa 2014; Wilkinson 2014; Wilkinson & Fernyhough\n2017), while others have developed other alternatives (Langland-Hassan\nforthcoming). The matter of how best to characterize the phenomenology\nand underlying etiology of AVHs and thought insertion\u2014and the\nrelation of each to inner speech\u2014together with the precise\nrelationship between predictive processing models and the comparator\napproach, remain active areas of research. See Wilkinson &\nAlderson-Day (2016) for an introduction to an edited special-issue on\nthe topic oriented at philosophers; see L\u00f3pez-Silva &\nMcClelland (forthcoming) for a philosophically-oriented anthology on\nthought insertion.
