The Ground of Induction\n\nThe Problem of Induction is the problem of vindicating as rational our\nunavoidable need to generalize beyond our current evidence to\ncomparable cases that we have not yet observed, or that never will be\nobserved. Without inductive inferences of this kind, not only all\nscience but all meaningful conduct of everyday life is paralyzed.\nIndeed, Williams prefaced his philosophical treatment with a\ndeclaration of the evils of inductive skepticism in eroding rational\nstandards in general, even in politics:\n\n\nIn the political sphere, the haphazard echoes of inductive skepticism\nwhich reach the liberal\u2019s ear deprive him of any rational right\nto champion liberalism, and account already as much as anything for\nthe flabbiness of liberal resistance to dogmatic encroachments from\nthe left or the right. (Williams 1947, pp 15\u201320)\n\n\nDavid Hume, in the eighteenth century, had shown that all such\ninferences must involve risk: no matter how certain our premises, no\ninductively reached conclusion can have the same degree of certainty.\nHume went further, and held that inductive reasoning provides no\nrational support whatever for its conclusions. This is Hume\u2019s\nfamous inductive scepticism.\n\nWilliams was almost alone in his time in holding not only that the\nproblem does admit of a solution, but in presenting a novel solution\nof his own. To do this, he needed to argue against Hume, and\nHume\u2019s twentieth century successors Bertrand Russell and Karl\nPopper, who had declared the problem insoluble, and also against\ncontemporaries such as P. F. Strawson and Paul Edwards, who had\nclaimed that there was no real problem at all (Russell 1912, Chapter\n6; Popper 1959; Edwards 1949, pp 141\u2013163; Strawson 1952, pp\n248\u2013263). Williams tackled the problem head-on. In The\nGround of Induction (1947) he makes original use of results\nalready established in probability theory, whose significance for the\nproblem of induction he was the first to appreciate. He treats\ninductive inference as a special case of the problem of validating\nsampling techniques. Among any population, that is, any class of\nsimilar items, there will be a definite proportion having any possible\ncharacteristic. For example, among the population of penguins, 100%\nwill be birds, about 50% will be female, some 10%, perhaps, will be\nEmperor penguins, some 35%, perhaps, will be more than seven years\nold, and so on. This is the complexion of the population,\nwith regard to femaleness, or whatever.\n\nNow in the pure mathematics of the relations between samples and\npopulations, Jacob Bernoulli had in the 18th century\nestablished the remarkable fact that, for populations of any large\nsize whatever (say above 2500), the vast majority of samples of 2500\nor more closely match in complexion the population from which they are\ndrawn. In the case of our penguins, for example, if the population\ncontains 35% aged 7 years or more, well over nine tenths of samples of\n2500 penguins will contain between 33% and 37% aged 7 years or more.\nThis is a necessary, purely mathematical, fact. In the language of\nstatistics, the vast majority of reasonably sized samples are\nrepresentative of their population, that is, closely resemble\nit in complexion.\n\nBernoulli\u2019s result enables us to infer from the complexion of a\npopulation to the complexion of most reasonably-sized samples taken\nfrom it, since the complexion of most samples closely resembles the\ncomplexion of the population. Williams\u2019s originality was this:\nhe noticed that resemblance is symmetrical. If we can prove, as\nBernoulli did, that most samples resemble the population from which\nthey are drawn, then conversely the population\u2019s complexion\nresembles the complexion of most of the samples.\n\nThis brings us to the problem of induction. What our observations of\nthe natural world provide us with can be regarded as samples from\nlarger populations. For example the penguins we have observed up to\nthis point provide us with a sample of the wider population of all\npenguins, at all times, whether observed or not. What can we infer\nabout this wider population from the sample we have? That, in all\nprobability, the population\u2019s complexion is close to that of the\nsample. We may of course, have an atypical sample before us.\nBut with samples of more than 2500, well over 90% represent the\npopulation fairly closely, so the odds are against it.\n\nThus Williams assimilates the problem of induction to an application\nof the statistical syllogism (also called direct inference or the\nproportional syllogism). A standard syllogism concerns complexions of\n100%, and has a determinate conclusion: if all S are P, and\nthis present item is an S, then it must be P. A\nstatistical syllogism deals with complexions of less than 100%, and\nits conclusion is not definite but only probable: for example, if\n95% of S are P, this present S is probably\nP. Some logicians claim that the probability in question is\nexactly 0.95, but Williams does not need to rely on that additional\nclaim. It is enough that the probability be high. Applying the\nstatistical syllogism to Williams\u2019 reversal of the Bernoulli\nresult, we have: 95% of reasonably-sized samples are closely\nrepresentative of their population, so the sample we have, provided\nthere are no grounds to think otherwise, is probably one of them. On\nthat basis, we are rationally entitled to infer that the population\nprobably closely matches the sample, whose complexion is known to us.\nThe inference is only probable. Induction cannot deliver certainty. In\nany given case, it is abstractly possible that our sample may be a\nmisleading, unrepresentative one. But to expect an inference from the\nobserved to the unobserved to yield certainty is to expect the\nimpossible.\n",
