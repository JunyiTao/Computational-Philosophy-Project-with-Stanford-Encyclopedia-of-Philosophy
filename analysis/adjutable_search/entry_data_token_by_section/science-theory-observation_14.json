    "main_text": "The epistemic value of empirical evidence || Empirical adequacy\n5. Conclusion\n\nOn an earlier way of thinking, observation was to serve as the\nunmediated foundation of science\u2014direct access to\nthe facts upon which the edifice of scientific knowledge could be\nbuilt. When conflict arose between factions with different ideological\ncommitments, observations could furnish the material for neutral\narbitration and settle the matter objectively, in virtue of being\nindependent of non-empirical commitments. According to this view,\nscientists working in different paradigms could at least appeal to the\nsame observations, and propagandists could be held accountable to the\npublicly accessible content of theory and value-free observations.\nDespite their different theories, Priestley and Lavoisier could find\nshared ground in the observations. Anti-Semites would be compelled to\nadmit the success of a theory authored by a Jewish physicist, in\nvirtue of the unassailable facts revealed by\nobservation.\n\nThis version of empiricism with respect to science does not accord\nwell with the fact that observation per se plays a relatively small\nrole in many actual scientific methodologies, and the fact that even\nthe most \u2018raw\u2019 data is often already theoretically imbued.\nThe strict contrast between theory and observation in science is more\nfruitfully supplanted by inquiry into the relationship between\ntheorizing and empirical results.\n\nContemporary philosophers of science tend to embrace the theory\nladenness of empirical results. Instead of seeing the integration of\nthe theoretical and the empirical as an impediment to furthering\nscientific knowledge, they see it as necessary. A \u2018view from\nnowhere\u2019 would not bear on our particular theories. That is, it\nis impossible to put empirical results to use without recruiting some\ntheoretical resources. In order to use an empirical result to\nconstrain or test a theory it has to be processed into a form that can\nbe compared to that theory. To get stellar spectrograms to bear on\nNewtonian or relativistic cosmology, they need to be\nprocessed\u2014into galactic rotation curves, say. The spectrograms\nby themselves are just artifacts, pieces of paper. Scientists need\ntheoretical resources in order to even identify that such artifacts\nbear information relevant for their purposes, and certainly to put\nthem to any epistemic use in assessing theories.\n\nThis outlook does not render contemporary philosophers of science all\nconstructivists, however. Theory mediates the connection between the\ntarget of inquiry and the scientific worldview, it does not sever it.\nMoreover, vigilance is still required to ensure that the particular\nways in which theory is \u2018involved\u2019 in the production of\nempirical results are not epistemically detrimental. Theory can be\ndeployed in experiment design, data processing, and presentation of\nresults in unproductive ways, for instance, in determining whether the\nresults will speak for or against a particular theory regardless of\nwhat the world is like. Critical appraisal of the roles of theory is\nthus important for genuine learning about nature through science.\nIndeed, it seems that extra-empirical values can sometimes assist such\ncritical appraisal. Instead of viewing observation as the theory-free\nand for that reason furnishing the content with which to appraise\ntheories, we might attend to the choices and mistakes that can be made\nin collecting and generating empirical results with the help of\ntheoretical resources, and endeavor to make choices conducive to\nlearning and correct mistakes as we discover them.\n\nRecognizing the involvement of theory and values in the constitution\nand generation of empirical results does not undermine the special\nepistemic value of empirical science in contrast to propaganda and\npseudoscience. In cases where the influence of cultural, political,\nand religious values hinder scientific inquiry, it is often the case\nthat they do so by limiting or determining the nature of the empirical\nresults. Yet, by working to make the assumptions that shape results\nexplicit we can examine their suitability for our purposes and attempt\nto restructure inquiry as necessary. When disagreements arise,\nscientists can attempt to settle them by appealing to the causal\nconnections between the research target and the empirical data. The\ntribunal of experience speaks through empirical results, but it only\ndoes so through via careful fashioning with theoretical resources.\n",
