Paradoxes, predicativism and the doctrine of types: 1905\u20131913\n\nIn the light of the foundational debate, the following years were rich\nin seminal work: new paradoxes were discovered (Berry,\nGrelling-Nelson), an old paradox\u2014the Liar\u2014showed up again,\na comprehensive view of the contradictions of logic and mathematics\nwas masterfully outlined in the opening section of Russell\u2019s\n1908 paper and the preceding Russell 1906a, while a conceptual\ndistinction between two kinds of paradoxes was set forth in\nPeano\u2019s paper of 1906. Also, the basic ideas of predicativity\nemerged in the discussion between Poincar\u00e9, the leading\nmathematician of the time, and Russell. Even more important for the\nhistory of mathematical logic, fundamental technical advances for\nsolving the paradoxes and shaping the foundations of logic and\nmathematics were made: Russell\u2019s theory of (ramified) types and\nZermelo\u2019s axiomatization of set theory.\n",
