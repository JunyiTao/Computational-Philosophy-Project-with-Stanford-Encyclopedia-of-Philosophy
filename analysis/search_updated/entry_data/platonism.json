    "main_text": "\n1. What is Platonism?\n\nPlatonism is the view that there exist abstract (that is, non-spatial,\nnon-temporal) objects (see the entry on\n abstract objects).\n Because abstract objects are wholly non-spatiotemporal, it follows\nthat they are also entirely non-physical (they do not exist in the\nphysical world and are not made of physical stuff) and non-mental\n(they are not minds or ideas in minds; they are not disembodied souls,\nor Gods, or anything else along these lines). In addition, they are\nunchanging and entirely causally inert \u2014 that is, they cannot be\ninvolved in cause-and-effect relationships with other\n objects.[1]\n All of this might be somewhat perplexing; for with all of these\nstatements about what abstract objects are not, it might be\nunclear what they are. We can clarify things, however, by\nlooking at some examples.\n\nConsider the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019. This sentence seems to\nsay something about a particular object, namely, the number 3. Just as\nthe sentence \u2018The moon is round\u2019 says something about the\nmoon, so too \u20183 is prime\u2019 seems to say something about the\nnumber 3. But what is the number 3? There are a few different\nviews that one might endorse here, but the platonist view is that 3 is\nan abstract object. On this view, 3 is a real and objective thing\nthat, like the moon, exists independently of us and our thinking\n(i.e., it is not just an idea in our heads). But according to\nplatonism, 3 is different from the moon in that it is not a physical\nobject; it is wholly non-physical, non-mental, and causally inert, and\nit does not exist in space or time. One might put this metaphorically\nby saying that on the platonist view, numbers exist \u201cin platonic\nheaven\u201d. But we should not infer from this that according to\nplatonism, numbers exist in a place; they do not, for the\nconcept of a place is a physical, spatial concept. It is more accurate\nto say that on the platonist view, numbers exist (independently of us\nand our thoughts) but do not exist in space and time.\n\nSimilarly, many philosophers take a platonistic view of\n properties.\n Consider, for instance, the property of being red. According to the\nplatonist view of properties, the property of redness exists\nindependently of any red thing. There are red balls and red houses and\nred shirts, and these all exist in the physical world. But platonists\nabout properties believe that in addition to these things, redness\n\u2014 the property itself \u2014 also exists, and according to\nplatonists, this property is an abstract object. Ordinary red objects\nare said to exemplify or instantiate redness. Plato\nsaid that they participate in redness, but this suggests a\ncausal relationship between red objects and redness, and again,\ncontemporary platonists would reject this.\n\nPlatonists of this sort say the same thing about other properties as\nwell: in addition to all the beautiful things, there is also beauty;\nand in addition to all the tigers, there is also the property of being\na tiger. Indeed, even when there are no instances of a property in\nreality, platonists will typically maintain that the property itself\nexists. This isn't to say that platonists are committed to the thesis\nthat there is a property corresponding to every predicate in the\nEnglish language. The point is simply that in typical cases, there\nwill be a property. For instance, according to this sort of platonism,\nthere exists a property of being a four-hundred-story building, even\nthough there are no such things as four-hundred-story buildings. This\nproperty exists outside of space and time along with redness. The only\ndifference is that in our physical world, the one property happens to\nbe instantiated whereas the other does not.\n\nIn fact, platonists extend the position here even further, for on\ntheir view, properties are just a special case of a much broader\ncategory, namely, the category of universals. It's easy to\nsee why one might think of a property like redness as a universal. A\nred ball that sits in a garage in Buffalo is a particular thing. But\nredness is something that is exemplified by many, many objects; it's\nsomething that all red objects share, or have in common. This is why\nplatonists think of redness as a universal and of specific red objects\n\u2014 such as balls in Buffalo, or cars in Cleveland \u2014 as\nparticulars.\n\nBut according to this sort of platonism, properties are not the only\nuniversals; there are other kinds of universals as well, most notably,\nrelations. Consider, for instance, the relation to the\nnorth of; this relation is instantiated by many pairs of objects\n(or more accurately, by ordered pairs of objects, since order matters\nhere \u2014 e.g., to the north of is instantiated by <San\nFrancisco, Los Angeles>, and <Edinburgh, London>, but not by\n<Los Angeles, San Francisco>, or <London, Edinburgh>). So\naccording to platonism, the relation to the north of is a\ntwo-place universal, whereas a property like redness is a\none-place universal. There are also three-place relations\n(which are three-place universals), four-place relations, and so on.\nAn example of a three-place relation is the gave relation,\nwhich admits of a giver, a givee, and a given \u2014 as in\n\u2018Jane gave a CD to Tim\u2019.\n\nFinally, some philosophers claim that propositions are\nabstract objects. One way to think of a proposition is as the meaning\nof a sentence. Alternatively, we can say that a proposition is that\nwhich is expressed by a sentence on a particular occasion of use.\nEither way, we can say that, e.g., the English sentence \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019 and the German sentence \u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019\nexpress the same proposition, namely, the proposition that snow is\nwhite.\n\nThere are many different platonistic conceptions of propositions. For\ninstance, Frege (1892, 1919) held that propositions are composed of\nsenses of words (e.g., on this view, the proposition that\nsnow is white is composed of the senses of \u2018snow\u2019 and\n\u2018is white\u2019), whereas Russell at one point (1905,\n1910\u201311) held that propositions are composed of properties,\nrelations, and objects (e.g., on this view, the proposition that Mars\nis red is composed of Mars (the planet itself) and the\nproperty of redness). Others hold that propositions do not\nhave significant internal structure. The differences between these\nviews will not matter for our purposes. For more detail, see the entry\non\n propositions.\n\n(It might seem odd to say that Russellian propositions are abstract\nobjects. Consider, e.g., the Russellian proposition that Mars is red.\nThis is an odd sort of hybrid object. It has two components,\nnamely, Mars (the planet itself) and the property of redness. One of\nthese components (namely, Mars) is a concrete object (where a\nconcrete object is just a spatiotemporal object). Thus, even if\nredness is an abstract object, it does not seem that the Russellian\nproposition is completely non-spatiotemporal. Nonetheless,\nphilosophers typically lump these objects together with abstract\nobjects. And it's not just Russellian propositions; similar remarks\ncan be made about various other kinds of objects. Think, for instance,\nof impure sets--e.g., the set containing Mars and Jupiter. This seems\nto be a hybrid object of some kind as well, because while it has\nconcrete objects as members, it's still a set, and on the\nstandard view, sets are abstract objects. If we wanted to be really\nprecise, it would probably be best to have another term for such\nobjects--e.g., \u2018hybrid object\u2019, or \u2018impure abstract\nobject\u2019--but, again, this isn't how philosophers typically talk;\nthey usually just treat these things as abstract objects. None of this\nwill matter very much in what follows, however, because this essay is\nalmost entirely concerned with what might be called pure\nabstract objects--i.e., abstract objects that are completely\nnon-spatiotemporal.) \n\nNumbers, propositions, and universals (i.e., properties and relations)\nare not the only things that people have taken to be abstract objects.\nAs we will see below, people have also endorsed platonistic views in\nconnection with linguistic objects (most notably, sentences), possible\nworlds, logical objects, and fictional characters (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). And it is important to note here that one can be a platonist\nabout some of these things without being a platonist about the others\n\u2014 e.g., one might be a platonist about numbers and propositions\nbut not properties or fictional characters.\n\nOf course, platonism about any of these kinds of objects is\ncontroversial. Many philosophers do not believe in abstract objects at\nall. The alternatives to platonism will be discussed in\n section 2,\n but it is worth noting here that the primary argument that platonists\ngive for their view is that, according to them, there are good\narguments against all other views. That is, platonists think we have\nto believe in abstract objects, because (a) there are good reasons for\nthinking that things like numbers and universals exist, and (b) the\nonly tenable view of these things is that they are abstract objects.\nWe will consider these arguments in detail below.\n2. A Taxonomy of Positions\n\nThere are not very many alternatives to platonism. One can reject the\nexistence of things like numbers and universals altogether. Or one can\nmaintain that there do exist such things as numbers and universals,\nand instead of saying that they are abstract objects, one can say that\nthey are mental objects of some sort (usually, the claim is that they\nare ideas in our heads) or physical objects of some sort. Thus, the\nfour mainstream views here are as follows (and keep in mind that\nanti-platonists can pursue different strategies with respect to\ndifferent kinds of alleged abstract objects, taking one view of, say,\nnumbers, and another view of properties or propositions).\n\nPlatonism: This is the view described in\n section 1.\n\n\nImmanent Realism: Advocates of this view agree with\nplatonists that there do exist such things as mathematical objects\n\u2014 or universals, or whatever category of alleged abstract\nobjects we're talking about \u2014 and that these things are\nindependent of us and our thinking; but immanent realists differ from\nplatonists in holding that these objects exist in the physical world.\nDepending on the kind of object under discussion \u2014 i.e., whether\nwe're talking about mathematical objects or properties or what have\nyou \u2014 the details of this view will be worked out differently.\nIn connection with properties, the standard immanent-realist view is\nthat properties like redness exist only in the physical world, in\nparticular, in actual red things, as nonspatial parts or aspects of\nthose things (this view traces back to Aristotle; in contemporary\ntimes, it has been defended by Armstrong (1978)). There is certainly\nsome initial plausibility to this idea: if you are looking at a red\nball, and you think that in addition to the ball, its redness exists,\nthen it seems a bit odd to say (as platonists do) that its redness\nexists outside of spacetime. After all, the ball is sitting right here\nin spacetime and we can see that it's red; so it seems initially\nplausible to think that if the redness exists at all, then it exists\nin the ball. As we will see below, however, there are serious problems\nwith this view.\n\nIn connection with numbers, one strategy is to take numbers to be\nuniversals of some sort \u2014 e.g., one might take them to be\nproperties of piles of physical objects, so that, for instance, the\nnumber 3 would be a property of, e.g., a pile of three books \u2014\nand to take an immanent realist view of universals. (This sort of view\nhas been defended by Armstrong (1978).) But views of this kind have\nnot been very influential in the philosophy of mathematics. A more\nprominent strategy for taking number talk to be about the physical\nworld is to take it to be about actual piles of physical objects,\nrather than properties of piles. Thus, for instance, one might\nmaintain that to say that 2 + 3 = 5 is not really to say something\nabout specific entities (numbers); rather, it is to say that whenever\nwe push a pile of two objects together with a pile of three objects,\nwe will wind up with a pile of five objects \u2014 or something along\nthese lines. Thus, on this view, arithmetic is just a very general\nnatural science. A view of this sort was developed by Mill (1843) and,\nmore recently, a similar view has been defended by Philip Kitcher\n(1984). It should be noted, however, that while there are certainly\nphysicalist themes running through the views of Mill and Kitcher, it\nis not clear that either of them should be interpreted as an immanent\nrealist. Kitcher is probably best classified as a kind of anti-realist\n(I'll say a bit more about this in\n section 4.1),\n and it's not entirely clear how Mill ought to be classified, relative\nto our taxonomy, because it's not clear how he would answer the\nquestion, \u201cAre there numbers, and if so, what are\nthey?\u201d\n\nFinally, Penelope Maddy (1990) has also developed a sort of immanent\nrealist view of mathematics. Concentrating mainly on set theory, Maddy\nmaintains that sets of physical objects are located in space and time,\nright where their members are located. But Maddian sets cannot be\nidentified with the physical matter that constitutes their members. On\nMaddy's view, corresponding to every physical object, there is a huge\ninfinity of sets (e.g., the set containing the given object, the set\ncontaining that set, and so on) that are all distinct from one another\nbut which all share the same matter and the same spatiotemporal\nlocation. Thus, on this view, there is more to a set than the physical\nstuff that makes up its members, and so Maddy might be better\ninterpreted as endorsing a nonstandard version of platonism. \n\n\nConceptualism (also called psychologism and\nmentalism, depending on the sorts of objects under\ndiscussion): This is the view that there do exist numbers \u2014 or\nproperties, or propositions, or whatever \u2014 but that they do not\nexist independently of us; instead, they are mental objects; in\nparticular, the claim is usually that they are something like ideas in\nour heads. As we will see below, this view has serious problems and\nnot very many people endorse it. Nonetheless, it has had periods of\npopularity in the history of philosophy. It is very often thought that\nLocke held a conceptualistic view of universals, and prior to the\ntwentieth century, this was the standard view of concepts and\npropositions. In the philosophy of mathematics, psychologistic views\nwere popular in the late nineteenth century (the most notable\nproponent being the early Husserl (1891)) and even in the first part\nof the twentieth century with the advent of psychologistic\nintuitionism (Brouwer 1912 and 1948, and Heyting 1956). Finally, Noam\nChomsky (1965) has endorsed a mentalistic view of sentences and other\nlinguistic objects, and he has been followed here by others, most\nnotably, Fodor (1975, 1987).\n\nIt should also be noted here that one can claim that the existence of\nnumbers (or propositions or whatever) is dependent on us\nhumans without endorsing a psychologistic view of the relevant\nentities. For one can combine this claim with the idea that the\nobjects in question are abstract objects. In other words, one might\nclaim \u2014 and some have claimed \u2014 that numbers (or\npropositions or whatever) are mind-dependent abstract objects, i.e.,\nobjects that exist outside of the mind, and outside of space and time,\nbut which only came into being because of the activities of human\nbeings. Liston (2003\u201304), Cole (2009), and Bueno (2009) endorse\nviews of this general kind in connection with mathematical objects;\nSchiffer (2003, chapter 2), Soames (2014), and King (2014) endorse\nviews like this of propositions; and Salmon (1998) and Thomasson\n(1999) endorse views like this of fictional objects.\n\n\nNominalism (also called anti-realism): This is the\nview that there are no such things as numbers, or universals, or\nwhatever sort of alleged abstract objects are under discussion. Thus,\nfor instance, a nominalist about properties would say that while there\nare such things as red balls and red houses, there is no such thing as\nthe property of redness, over and above the red balls and red houses.\nAnd a nominalist about numbers would say that while there are such\nthings as piles of three stones, and perhaps \u201c3-ideas\u201d\nexisting in people's heads, there is no such thing as the number 3. As\nwe will see below, there are many different versions of each of these\nkinds of nominalism, but for now, we don't need anything more than\nthis general formulation of the view. (Sometimes\n\u2018nominalism\u2019 is used to denote the view that there are no\nsuch things as abstract objects; on this usage,\n\u2018nominalism\u2019 is synonymous with\n\u2018anti-platonism\u2019, and views like immanent realism count as\nversions of nominalism. In contrast, on the usage employed in this\nessay, \u2018nominalism\u2019 is essentially synonymous with\n\u2018anti-realism\u2019, and so views like immanent realism will\nnot count as versions of nominalism here.)\n\n\nPrima facie, it might seem that nominalism, or anti-realism,\nis further from the platonist view than immanent realism and\nconceptualism are for the simple reason that the latter two views\nadmit that there do exist such things as numbers (or universals, or\nwhatever). It is important to note, however, that nominalists agree\nwith platonists on an important point that immanent realists and\nconceptualists reject; in particular, nominalists (in agreement with\nplatonists) endorse the following thesis:\n\n(S) If there were such things as numbers (or universals, or whatever\nsort of alleged abstract objects we're talking about), then they would\nbe abstract objects; that is, they would be non-spatiotemporal,\nnon-physical, and non-mental.\n\n\nThis is an extremely important point, because it turns out that there\nare some very compelling arguments (which we will discuss) in favor of\n(S). As a result, there are very few advocates of immanent realism and\nconceptualism, especially in connection with mathematical objects and\npropositions. There is wide-spread agreement about what numbers and\npropositions would be if there were such things (namely, abstract\nobjects) but very little agreement as to whether there do exist such\nthings. Thus, today, the controversial question here is a purely\nontological one: Are there any such things as abstract objects (e.g.,\nmathematical objects, propositions, and so on)?\n\nIt is worth noting that while there are only four mainstream views\nhere (viz., platonism, immanent realism, conceptualism, and\nnominalism) a fifth view deserves mention, namely,\nMeinongianism (see Meinong (1904)). On this view, every\nsingular term \u2014 e.g., \u2018Clinton\u2019, \u20183\u2019,\nand \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019 \u2014 picks out an object that has\nsome sort of being (that subsists, or that is, in\nsome sense) but only some of these objects have full-blown existence.\nAccording to Meinongianism, sentences that platonists take to be about\nabstract objects \u2014 sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 and\n\u2018Red is a color\u2019 \u2014 express truths about objects that\ndon't exist.\n\nMeinongianism has been almost universally rejected by philosophers.\nThe standard argument against it (see, e.g., Quine (1948), p. 3, and\nLewis (1990)) is that it does not provide a view that is clearly\ndistinct from platonism and merely creates the illusion of a different\nview by altering the meaning of the term \u2018exist\u2019. The idea\nhere is that on the standard meaning of \u2018exist\u2019, any\nobject that has any being at all exists, and so according to standard\nusage, Meinongianism entails that numbers and universals exist; but\nthis view clearly doesn't take such things to exist in spacetime and\nso, the argument concludes, Meinongianism entails that numbers and\nuniversals are abstract objects \u2014 just as platonism does.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that while Meinongianism has mostly been\nrejected, it does have some more contemporary advocates, most notably,\nRoutley (1980), Parsons (1980), and Priest (2003, 2005).\n3. The One Over Many Argument\n\nThere are two mainstream arguments for platonism. The first, which\ngoes back to Plato, is an argument for the existence of properties and\nrelations only; this is the One Over Many argument. The\nsecond is also present in some sense in the works of Plato (at least\non some readings of those works), but its first modern formulation,\nand certainly the first clear formulation, was given by Frege\n(1884, 1892, 1893\u20131903, 1919); I will call this the singular\nterm argument, and unlike the One Over Many, it can be used in\nconnection with all the different kinds of abstract objects, i.e.,\nnumbers, properties, propositions, and so on. In the present section,\nwe will discuss the One Over Many argument, and in the next section,\nwe will discuss the singular term argument.\n\nThe One Over Many argument can be formulated as follows:\n\nI have in front of me three red objects (say a ball, a hat, and a\nrose). These objects resemble one another. Therefore, they have\nsomething in common. What they have in common is clearly a property,\nnamely, redness; therefore, redness exists.\n\n\nWe can think of this argument as an inference to the best explanation.\nThere is a fact that requires explanation, namely, that the three\nobjects resemble each other. The explanation is that they all possess\na single property, namely, redness. Thus, platonists argue, if there\nis no other explanation of this fact (i.e., the fact of resemblance)\nthat is as good as their explanation (i.e., the one that appeals to\nproperties), then we are justified in believing in properties.\n\nNotice that as the argument has been stated here, it is not an\nargument for a platonistic view of properties; it is an argument for\nthe thesis that properties exist, but not for the thesis that\nproperties are abstract objects. Thus, in order to use this argument\nto motivate platonism, one would have to supplement it with some\nreason for thinking that the properties in question here could not be\nideas in our heads or immanent properties existing in particular\nphysical objects. There are a number of arguments that one might use\nhere, and in\n section 4.3,\n we will discuss some of these. But there is no need to pursue this\nhere, because there is good reason to think that the One Over Many\nargument doesn't succeed anyway \u2014 i.e., that it doesn't provide\na good reason for believing in properties of any sort. In other words,\nthe One Over Many argument fails to refute nominalism about\nproperties.\n\nBefore proceeding, it is worth pointing out that the One Over Many\nargument described above can be simplified. As Michael Devitt (1980)\npoints out, the appeal to resemblance, or to multiple things\nhaving a given property, is a red herring. On the traditional\nformulation, nominalists are challenged to account for the following\nfact: the ball is red and the hat is red. But if nominalists can\naccount for the fact that the ball is red, then presumably, they can\nsimply repeat the same sort of explanation in connection with the hat,\nand they will have accounted for the fact that both things are red.\nThus, the real challenge for the nominalist is to explain simple\npredicative facts, e.g., the fact that the ball is red, without\nappealing to properties, e.g., redness. More generally, they need to\nshow how we can account for the truth of sentences of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 without appealing to a property\nof\n Fness.[2]\n\n(One might also think of the argument as asking not for an explanation\nof the fact that, say, Mars is red, but rather for an account of what\nit is about the world that makes the sentence \u2018Mars is\nred\u2019 true. See Peacock (2009) in this regard.)\n\nThere is a very well-known nominalist response to the One Over Many\nargument. The heart of the response is captured by the following\nremark from Quine (1948, p. 10):\n\nThat the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red may be taken\nas ultimate and irreducible, and it may be held that...[the platonist]\nis no better off, in point of real explanatory power, for all the\noccult entities which he posits under such names as\n\u2018redness\u2019.\n\n\nThere are two different ideas here. The first is that nominalists can\nrespond to the One Over Many with an appeal to irreducible facts, or\nbrute facts. The second is that platonists are no better off\nthan such brute-fact nominalists in terms of real explanatory power.\nNow, Quine didn't say very much about these two ideas, but both ideas\nhave been developed by Devitt (1980, 2010), whose exposition we follow\nhere.\n\nThe challenge to nominalists is to provide an explanation of facts of\na certain kind, namely, predicative facts expressed by sentences of\nthe form \u2018a is F\u2019, e.g., the fact that a\ngiven ball is red. Now, whenever we are challenged to provide an\nexplanation of a fact, or alleged fact, we have a number options. The\nmost obvious response is simply to provide the requested explanation.\nBut we can also argue that the alleged fact isn't really a fact at\nall. Or, third, we can argue that the fact in question is a\nbrute fact \u2014 i.e., a fact that does not have an\nexplanation. Now, in the present case, nominalists cannot claim that\nall predicative facts are brute facts, because it is clear that we\ncan explain at least some facts of this sort. For instance,\nit seems that the fact that a given ball is red can be explained very\neasily by saying that it is red because it reflects light in such and\nsuch a way, and that it reflects light in this way because its surface\nis structured in thus and so a manner. So nominalists should not claim\nthat all predicative facts are brute facts. But as Devitt points out,\nthere is a more subtle way to appeal to bruteness here, and if Quinean\nnominalists make use of this, they can block the One Over Many\nargument.\n\nThe Quine-Devitt response to the One Over Many begins with the claim\nthat we can account for the fact that the ball is red, without\nappealing to the property of redness, by simply using whatever\nexplanation scientists give of this fact. Now, by itself, this\nexplanation will not satisfy advocates of the One Over Many argument.\nIf we explain the fact that the ball is red by pointing out that its\nsurface is structured in some specific way, then advocates of the One\nOver Many argument will say that we have only moved the problem back a\nstep, because nominalists will now have to account for the fact that\nthe ball's surface is structured in the given way, and they will have\nto do this without appealing to the property of being structured in\nthe given way. More generally, the point is this: it is of course true\nthat if nominalists are asked to account for the fact that some object\na is F, without appealing to the property of\nFness, they can do this by pointing out that (i) a\nis G and (ii) all Fs are Gs (this is the\nsort of explanation they will get if they borrow their explanations\nfrom scientists); but such explanations only move the problem back a\nstep, for they leave us with the task of having to explain the fact\nthat a is G, and if we want to endorse nominalism,\nwe will have to do this without appealing to the property of\nGness.\n\nThis is where the appeal to bruteness comes in. Nominalists can say\nthat (a) we can keep giving explanations of the above sort (i.e.,\nexplanations of the sort \u2018a is F because it is\nG,\u2019 or because its parts are Gs, Hs,\nand Is, or whatever) for as long as we can, and (b) when\nexplanations of this sort cannot be given, no explanation at all can\nbe given. The thought here is that at this point, we will have arrived\nat fundamental facts that do not admit of explanations \u2014 e.g.,\nfacts about the basic physical natures of elementary particles. When\nwe arrive at facts like this, we will say: \u201cThere's no reason\nwhy these particles are this way; they just are.\u201d\n\nThis gives us a way of understanding how nominalists can plausibly use\nan appeal to bruteness to respond to the One Over Many argument. But\nthe appeal to bruteness is only half of the Quinean remark quoted\nabove. What about the other half, i.e., the part about the platonist\nbeing no better off than brute-fact nominalists in terms of real\nexplanatory power? To appreciate this claim, let us suppose that we\nhave arrived at a bottom-level fact that Quinean nominalists take to\nbe a brute fact (e.g., the fact that physical particles of some\nparticular kind \u2014 say, gluons \u2014 are G). Advocates\nof the One Over Many would say that their view is superior to Quinean\nnominalism because they can provide an explanation of the fact in\nquestion. Now, when they announce this, people who were interested in\nthe question of why gluons are G, and who had been\ndisappointed to hear from scientists and Quineans that this is simply\na brute fact, might get very excited and listen eagerly to what\nadvocates of the One Over Many have to say. What they say is this:\n\nGluons are G because they possess the property of\nGness.\n\n\nThis doesn't seem very helpful. The claim that gluons possess\nGness seems to do little more than tell us that gluons have\nsome nature that makes it the case that they are G, and so it\nseems that no genuine explanation has been given. After all, those who\nhad been interested in learning why gluons are G would not be\nvery satisfied by this so-called \u201cexplanation\u201d. Thus, to\nuse Quine's words, it seems that advocates of the One Over Many are\n\u201cno better off, in point of real explanatory power\u201d than\nbrute-fact nominalists are.\n\nNominalists might try to push the argument a bit further here,\nclaiming that the sentence\n\n(P) Gluons possesses the property of Gness\n\n\nis just a paraphrase of the sentence\n\n(N) Gluons are G.\n\n\nOn this view, (P) is equivalent to (N). That is, it says the\nvery same thing. And neither sentence, according to this view, entails\nthe existence of Gness. We can call this a\nparaphrase-nominalist view of sentences like (P). But\nnominalists needn't endorse this view. They can also endorse a\nfictionalist view of sentences like (P). On this view, (P)\nand (N) do not, strictly speaking, say the same thing, because (P)\ntalks about the property of Gness and (N) does not. According\nto this fictionalist view, (P) is strictly speaking untrue, because it\ntalks about the property of Gness, and according to\nnominalism, there is no such thing as Gness. In short, (P) is\nstrictly speaking untrue, on this view, for the same reason that,\ne.g., \u2018The tooth fairy is nice\u2019 is untrue. But while (P)\nis not literally true on this view, it is\n\u201cfor-all-practical-purposes true\u201d, or some such thing,\nbecause colloquially, it can be used to say what (N) says literally.\nThis idea is often captured by saying that (P) is just a manner of\nspeaking, or a fa\u00e7on de parler. (Notice that the\ndispute between fictionalism and paraphrase nominalism is best\nunderstood as a straightforward empirical dispute about the\nordinary-language semantics of sentences like (P); the question is\nwhether such utterances literally say the same things that the\ncorresponding sentences like (N) say.)\n\nWhichever view nominalists adopt here, they can respond to the One\nOver Many argument \u2014 i.e., to the claim that we can explain (N)\nby endorsing (P) \u2014 in the same way, namely, by pointing out that\nas an explanation of (N), (P) is completely uninformative. Even if\nnominalists endorse a fictionalist view according to which (P) is not\nequivalent to (N), they can still say that the above explanation is\nuninformative, because it really just says that gluons are G\nbecause they possess a nature that makes it the case that they are\nG.\n\nHaving made the point that the platonist explanation of (N) is\nuninformative, the nominalist's next move is to appeal to Ockham's\nrazor to argue that we shouldn't believe in Gness (or at\nleast that we shouldn't believe in Gness for any reason that\nhas anything to do with the need to explain things like (N)). Ockham's\nrazor is a principle that tells us that we should believe in objects\nof a given kind only if they play a genuine explanatory role. This\nprinciple suggests that if Gness does not play a genuine role\nin an explanation of the fact that gluons are G, then we\nshouldn't believe in Gness \u2014 or, again, we shouldn't\nbelieve in it for any reason having to do with the need to explain the\nfact that gluons are G.\n\nThe Quinean response to the One Over Many argument is often couched in\nterms of a criterion of ontological commitment. A criterion\nof ontological commitment is a principle that tells us when we are\ncommitted to believing in objects of a certain kind in virtue of\nhaving assented to certain sentences. What the above response to the\nOne Over Many suggests is that we are ontologically committed not by\npredicates like \u2018is red\u2019 and \u2018is a rock\u2019, but\nby singular terms. (A singular term is just a denoting\nphrase, i.e., an expression that purports to refer to a specific\nobject, e.g., proper names like \u2018Mars\u2019 and\n\u2018Clinton\u2019, certain uses of pronouns like\n\u2018she\u2019, and on some views, definite descriptions like\n\u2018the oldest U.S. senator\u2019.) More specifically, the idea\nhere seems to be this: if you think that a sentence of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 is true, then you have to\naccept the existence of the object a, but you do not have to\naccept the existence of a property of Fness; for instance, if\nyou think that \u2018The ball is red\u2019 is true, then you have to\nbelieve in the ball, but you do not have to believe in redness; or if\nyou think that \u2018Fido is a dog\u2019 is true, then you have to\nbelieve in Fido but not in the property of doghood.\n\nThree points need to be made here. First, the above criterion needs to\nbe generalized so that it covers the use of singular terms in other\nkinds of sentences, e.g., sentences of the form \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019. Second, on the standard view,\nwe are ontologically committed not just by singular terms but also by\nexistential statements \u2014 e.g., by sentences like \u2018There\nare some Fs\u2019, \u2018There is at least one\nF\u2019, and so on (in first-order logic, such sentences are\nsymbolized as \u2018(\u2203x)Fx\u2019, and the\n\u2018\u2203\u2019 is called an existential quantifier).\nThe standard view here is that if you think that a sentence like this\nis true, then you are committed to believing in the existence of some\nFs (or at least one F) but you do not have to\nbelieve in Fness; for instance, if we assent to \u2018There\nare some dogs\u2019, then we are committed to believing in the\nexistence of some dogs, but we are not thereby committed to believing\nin the existence of the property of doghood. (Quine actually thought\nthat we are committed only by existential claims and not by\nsingular terms; but this is not a widely held view.) Third and\nfinally, it is usually held that we are ontologically committed by\nsingular terms and existential expressions (or existential\nquantifiers) only when they appear in sentences that we think are\nliterally true and only when we think the singular term or\nexistential quantifier in question can't be paraphrased away.\nWe can see what's meant by this by returning to the sentence\n\n(R) The ball possesses the property of redness.\n\n\nIn this sentence, the expression \u2018the property of redness\u2019\nseems to be a singular term \u2014 it seems to denote the\nproperty of redness; thus, using the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment, if we think (R) is true, then it would seem, we are\ncommitted to believing in the property of redness. But there are two\ndifferent responses that nominalists can make to this. First, they can\nendorse paraphrase nominalism (defined a few paragraphs back) with\nrespect to (R). If they do this, they will claim that (R) doesn't\nreally carry an ontological commitment to the property of redness,\nbecause it is really just equivalent to the sentence \u2018The ball\nis red\u2019. This idea is often expressed by saying that in (R), the\nsingular term \u2018the property of redness\u2019 can be\nparaphrased away \u2014 which is just to say that (R) can be\nparaphrased by (or is equivalent to) a sentence that doesn't contain\nthe singular term \u2018the property of redness\u2019 (namely,\n\u2018The ball is red\u2019). The second view that nominalists can\nendorse with respect to (R) is fictionalism. In other words, they can\nadmit that (R) does commit to the existence of the property of\nredness, but they can maintain that because of this (and because there\nare no such things as properties), (R) is, strictly speaking, untrue,\neven if it is \u201cfor-all-practical-purposes true,\u201d or some\nsuch thing.\n\nHaving said all of this, we can summarize by saying that the standard\nview of ontological commitment is as follows:\n\nCriterion of Ontological Commitment: We are ontologically\ncommitted by the singular terms (that can't be paraphrased away) in\nthe (simple) sentences that we take to be literally true; and we are\nontologically committed by the existential quantifiers (that can't be\nparaphrased away) in the (existential) sentences that we take to be\nliterally true; but we are not committed by the predicates in such\nsentences. Thus, for instance, if we believe that a sentence of the\nform \u2018a is F\u2019 is literally true, and if\nwe think that it cannot be paraphrased into some other sentence that\navoids reference to a, then we are committed to believing in\nthe object a but not the property of Fness; and,\nlikewise, if we assent to a sentence of the form \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019, then we are committed to\nbelieving in the objects a and b but not the\nrelation R; and if we assent to a sentence of the form\n\u2018There is an F\u2019 then we are committed to\nbelieving in an object that is F but we are not committed to\nthe property of\n Fness.[3]\n\n\nThe One Over Many argument is now widely considered to be a bad\nargument. Ironically, though, the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment \u2014 which Quinean nominalists appeal to in responding\nto the One Over Many argument \u2014 is one of the central premises\nin what is now thought to be the best argument for platonism. We will\ncall this argument the singular term argument, although one\nmight just as well call it the\nsucker-punch-on-the-Quinean-nominalist argument, for as we\nwill see, the strategy is to accept the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment and turn it against the Quinean nominalist.\n4. The Singular Term Argument\n\nThe general argument strategy here has roots in the work of Plato, but\nits first clear formulation was given by Frege (1884, 1892,\n1893\u20131903, and 1919). We begin with a general formulation of the\nargument:\n\nIf a simple sentence (i.e., a sentence of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019, or \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019, or\u2026) is literally\ntrue, then the objects that its singular terms denote exist.\n(Likewise, if an existential sentence is literally true, then there\nexist objects of the relevant kinds; e.g., if \u2018There is an\nF\u2019 is true, then there exist some Fs.)\nThere are literally true simple sentences containing singular\nterms that refer to things that could only be abstract objects.\n(Likewise, there are literally true existential statements whose\nexistential quantifiers range over things that could only be abstract\nobjects.) Therefore,\nAbstract objects exist.\n\n\nPremise (1) follows straightaway from the criterion of ontological\ncommitment that we discussed in the last section. Again, this is\nwidely accepted among contemporary philosophers, and for good reason\n\u2014 if you think that a sentence of the form \u2018a is\nF\u2019 is literally true and that it cannot be paraphrased\ninto some other sentence, then it's hard to see how you can deny that\nthere is such a thing as the object a. Therefore, since (3)\nfollows trivially from (1) and (2), the central question we have to\nanswer, in order to evaluate the above argument, is whether (2) is\ntrue. (Below, I will discuss the possibility of denying (1), but for\nnow I want to focus on (2).) In any event, in order to motivate (2),\nplatonists need to provide some examples; that is, they have to\nproduce some sentences and argue that (i) they contain singular terms\nthat can only be taken as referring to abstract objects (and that\ncan't be paraphrased away) and (ii) they are literally true.\nPlatonists maintain that there are many different kinds of such\nsentences. In what follows, we will consider versions of this argument\nthat attempt to establish the existence of mathematical objects (e.g.,\nnumbers), propositions, properties, relations, sentence types,\npossible worlds, logical objects, and fictional objects.\n4.1 Mathematical Objects\n\nPlatonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems of our\nmathematical theories \u2014 sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019\n(a theorem of arithmetic) and \u2018There are infinitely many\ntransfinite cardinal numbers\u2019 (a theorem of set theory) \u2014\nare literally true and that the only plausible view of such sentences\nis that they are about abstract objects (i.e., that their singular\nterms denote abstract objects and their existential quantifiers range\nover abstract objects). This general stance toward mathematics goes\nback to Plato, but the first clear statement of the argument in this\nform was given by Frege (1884); other advocates include Quine (see his\n1948 and 1951, though he doesn't explicitly state the argument there),\nG\u00f6del (1964), Parsons (1965, 1971, 1994), Putnam (1971), Steiner\n(1975), Resnik (1981, 1997), Zalta (1983, 1999), Wright (1983),\nBurgess (1983), Hale (1987), Shapiro (1989, 1997), the early Maddy\n (1990),[4]\n Katz (1998), Colyvan (2001), McEvoy (2005, 2012), and Marcus\n(2015).\n\nLet's begin our discussion of the platonists' argument here by\nconsidering their reasons for thinking that we have to take sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 to be about abstract objects rather than\nmental or physical objects of some kind. And let's start with a\ndiscussion of the psychologistic view that mathematics is about mental\nobjects.\n\nFrege (1884, introduction and section 27; 1893\u20131903,\nintroduction; 1894; and 1919) gave several compelling arguments\nagainst psychologism. First, it seems that psychologism is incapable\nof accounting for the truth of sentences that are about all\nnatural numbers, because there are infinitely many natural numbers and\nclearly, there could not be infinitely many number-ideas in human\nminds. Second, psychologism seems to entail that sentences about very\nlarge numbers (in particular, numbers that no one has ever had a\nthought about) are not true; for if none of us has ever had a thought\nabout some very large number, then psychologism entails that there is\nno such number and, hence, that no sentence about that number could be\ntrue. Third, psychologism turns mathematics into a branch of\npsychology, and it makes mathematical truths contingent upon\npsychological truths, so that, for instance, if we all died, \u20184\nis greater than 2\u2019 would suddenly become untrue. But this seems\nwrong: it seems that mathematics is true independently of us; that is,\nit seems that the question of whether 4 is greater than 2 has nothing\nat all to do with the question of how many humans are alive. Fourth\nand finally, psychologism suggests that the proper methodology for\nmathematics is that of empirical psychology; that is, it seems that if\npsychologism were true, then the proper way to discover whether, say,\nthere is a prime number between 10,000,000 and 10,000,020, would be to\ndo an empirical study of humans and ascertain whether there is, in\nfact, an idea of such a number in one of our heads; but of course,\nthis is not the proper methodology for mathematics. As Frege says\n(1884, section 27), \u201cWeird and wonderful\u2026are the results\nof taking seriously the suggestion that number is an idea.\u201d\n\nPlatonists do not deny that we have ideas of mathematical objects.\nWhat they deny is that our mathematical sentences are about\nthese ideas. Thus, the dispute between platonism and psychologism is\nprimarily a semantic one. Advocates of psychologism agree with\nplatonists that in the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019,\n\u20183\u2019 functions as a singular term (i.e., as a denoting\nexpression). But they disagree about the referent of this expression.\nThey think that \u20183\u2019 refers to a mental object, in\nparticular, an idea in our heads. It is this semantic thesis\nthat platonists reject and that the above Fregean arguments are\nsupposed to refute. More specifically, they're supposed to show that\nthe psychologistic semantics of mathematical discourse is not correct\nbecause it has consequences that fly in the face of the actual usage\nof mathematical language.\n\nAnother argument for the superiority of the platonist semantics of\nmathematical discourse over the psychologist semantics is based on the\nfact that in ordinary usage, one way to say that something doesn't\nexist is to say that \u201cit exists only in your\n head\u201d.[5]\n To say that mathematical objects exist only in our heads, it seems,\nis just to say that they don't exist. For to say that they (as opposed\nto our ideas of them) exist is to say that they exist independently of\nus and our thinking. Quine put this point in a very compelling way in\nconnection with a conceptualistic view of mythical objects like\nPegasus. He writes (1948, p. 2):\n\nMcX [who maintains that Pegasus exists and is an idea in our heads]\nnever confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon-idea. The Parthenon is\nphysical; the Parthenon-idea is mental\u2026We cannot easily imagine\ntwo things more unlike\u2026But when we shift from the Parthenon to\nPegasus, the confusion sets in \u2014 for no other reason than that\nMcX would sooner be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant\ncounterfeit than grant the nonbeing of Pegasus.\n\n\nThe same argument can be run against the psychologistic conflation of\n3-ideas with 3: you might doubt that there really is such a thing as\nthe number 3, existing objectively and independently of us, but you\nshould not for that reason claim that your idea of 3 is 3,\nfor that is just a confusion \u2014 it is like saying that your idea\nof Pegasus is Pegasus, or that your idea of the Parthenon is\nthe Parthenon.\n\nLet us move on now to immanent-realist, or physicalist, views of\nmathematics, and let us concentrate first on views like Mill's (1843,\nbook II, chapters 5 and 6), i.e., views that maintain that sentences\nabout numbers are really just general claims about bunches of ordinary\nobjects. On this view, the sentence \u20182 + 1 = 3\u2019, for\ninstance, isn't really about specific objects (the numbers 1, 2, and\n3). Rather, it says that whenever we add one object to a pile of two\nobjects, we will get a pile of three objects. Now, in order to account\nfor contemporary mathematics in this way, a contemporary Millian would\nhave to take set theory to be about ordinary objects as well. This,\nhowever, is untenable. One argument here is that set theory could not\nbe about bunches of ordinary objects, or piles of physical stuff,\nbecause corresponding to every physical pile, there are many, many\nsets. Corresponding to a ball, for instance, is the set containing the\nball, the set containing its molecules, the set containing its atoms,\nand so on. (And we know that these are different sets, because they\nhave different members, and it follows from set theory that if set\nA and set B have different members, then A\nis not identical to B.) Indeed, the principles of set theory\nentail that corresponding to every physical object, there is a huge\ninfinity of sets. Corresponding to our ball, for instance, there is\nthe set containing the ball, the set containing that set, the set\ncontaining that set, and so on; and there is the set\ncontaining the ball and the set containing the set containing the\nball; and so on and on and on. Clearly, these sets are not just piles\nof physical stuff, because (a) there are infinitely many of them\n(again, this follows from the principles of set theory) and (b) all of\nthese infinitely many sets share the same physical base. Thus, it\nseems that claims about sets are not claims about bunches of ordinary\nobjects, or even generalized claims about such bunches. They are\nclaims about sets, which are objects of a different kind.\n\nAnother problem with physicalistic views along the lines of Mill's is\nthat they seem incapable of accounting for the sheer size of the\ninfinities involved in set theory. Standard set theory entails not\njust that there are infinitely large sets, but that there are\ninfinitely many sizes of infinity, which get larger and larger with no\nend, and that there actually exist sets of all of these different\nsizes of infinity. There is simply no plausible way to take this\ntheory to be about physical stuff.\n\n(These arguments do not refute the kind of immanent realism defended\nby the early Maddy (1990). On Maddy's view, sets of physical objects\nare located in spacetime, right where their members are. Thus, if you\nhave two eggs in your hand, then you also have the set containing\nthose eggs in your hand. Maddy's view has no problem accounting for\nthe massive infinities in mathematics, for on her view, corresponding\nto every physical object, there is a huge infinity of sets that exist\nin space and time, right where the given physical object exists. Given\nthis, it should be clear that while Maddy's view says that sets exist\nin spacetime, it cannot be thought of as saying that sets are physical\nobjects. So Maddy's view is not a physicalist view in the sense that's\nrelevant here (as was pointed out above, it is better thought of as a\nnon-standard version of platonism). Thus, in the present context\n(i.e., the context in which platonists are trying to undermine views\nthat take mathematical objects to be physical objects), platonists do\nnot need to argue against Maddy's view. Of course, in the end, if they\nwant to motivate the standard version of platonism, then they'll have\nto give reasons for preferring their view to Maddy's non-standard\nversion of platonism, and this might prove hard to do. For some\narguments against Maddy's early view, see, e.g., Lavine (1992),\nDieterle and Shapiro (1993), Balaguer (1998a), Milne (1994), Riskin\n(1994), Carson (1996), and the later Maddy (1997).)\n\nIf arguments like the ones we've been discussing here are cogent, then\nsentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are not about physical or\nmental objects, and therefore, psychologism and immanent realism are\nnot tenable views of mathematics. But that is not the end of the\nsingular term argument for the existence of abstract mathematical\nobjects, for we still need to consider nominalistic views of sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019. In order for platonists to establish\ntheir view, they need to refute these nominalistic views as well as\npsychologistic and physicalistic views. And it should be noted that\nthis is the hard part. There is a good deal of agreement among\nphilosophers of mathematics that psychologism and immanent realism are\nuntenable; that is, most philosophers of mathematics are either\nplatonists or nominalists; but there is very little agreement as to\nwhether platonism or nominalism is correct.\n\nHow can nominalists proceed in developing an account of sentences like\n\u20183 is prime\u2019? One strategy is to reject premise (1) and\nthe standard criterion of ontological commitment discussed above. The\nmost obvious way to do this is to endorse the following view: (a)\nsimple mathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 should be\nread as being of the form \u2018a is F' and as\nbeing about abstract objects (e.g., \u20183\u2019 should be taken as\ndenoting the number 3, which could only be an abstract object, and\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 should be taken as being a claim about that\nobject); and (b) abstract objects \u2014 in particular, mathematical\nobjects like the number 3 \u2014 don\u2019t exist (and the claim\nhere is that they don\u2019t have any sort of being whatsoever, so\nthis is not a Meinongian view); but (c) sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 are still literally true. Thus, on this view, a claim\nabout an object a can be true even if that object\ndoesn\u2019t exist at all. Let\u2019s call this view\nthin-truth-ism. Views of this general kind have been endorsed\nby Azzouni (1994, 2004), Salmon (1998), and Bueno (2005). \n\nThin-truth-ists endorse a similar view of existence claims. For\ninstance, on their view, the sentence \u2018There are infinitely many\nprime numbers\u2019 is literally true, even though there are no such\nthings as numbers. This might look like a contradiction, but it's not,\nbecause according to thin-truth-ism, existential expressions (or\nquantifiers) like 'there is' are ambiguous.\n\nMost philosophers find this view extremely hard to believe. Indeed, a\nlot of philosophers would say that it is simply confused, or\nincoherent. But, in fact, thin-truth-ism is not incoherent. A better\nway to formulate the problem with the view is as follows: in giving up\non the standard criterion of ontological commitment, thin-truth-ists\nseem to be using \u2018true\u2019 in a non-standard way. Most of us\nwould say that if there is no such thing as the number 3, and if\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 is read at face value (i.e., as being about\nthe number 3), then it follows trivially that \u20183 is prime\u2019\ncould not be true. Or more generally, most of us would say that if\nthere is no such thing as the object a, then sentences of the\nform \u2018a is F\u2019 cannot be literally true.\nThis, of course, is just to say that most of us accept the standard\ncriterion of ontological commitment discussed above, but the point\nhere is that this criterion seems to be built into the standard\nmeaning of words like \u2018true\u2019. Indeed, this explains why\nthe standard criterion of ontological commitment is so widely\naccepted.\n\nAnother worry one might raise about thin-truth-ism is that it only\ndiffers from fictionalism in a merely verbal way. Let\n\u2018thin-true\u2019 express the kind of truth that thin-truth-ists\nhave in mind, and let \u2018thick-true\u2019 express the kind of\ntruth that everyone else in the debate has in mind (i.e., platonists,\nfictionalists, paraphrase nominalists, and so on). Given this,\nfictionalists and thin-truth-ists will both endorse all of the\nfollowing claims: (a) platonists are right that \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 is a claim about the number 3; and (b) there is no such\nthing as the number 3; so (c) \u20183 is prime\u2019 isn\u2019t\nthick-true; but despite this, (d) \u20183 is prime\u2019 is\nthin-true. Now, of course, thin-truth-ists and fictionalists will\ndisagree about whether \u20183 is prime\u2019 is true, but\nthis will collapse into a disagreement about whether thin-truth or\nthick-truth is real truth, and this is just a disagreement\nabout what the word \u2018true\u2019 means in ordinary folk English,\nand it\u2019s hard to see why an empirical question about how the\nfolk happen to use some word is relevant to the debate about the\nexistence of mathematical objects.\n\nIn any event, if we reject thin-truth-ism \u2014 i.e., if we accept\npremise (1) and the standard criterion of ontological commitment\n\u2014 then there are two general strategies that nominalists can\nadopt in giving a view of mathematical sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019. First, they can endorse a paraphrase view, and second,\nthey can endorse a fictionalist view. Those who endorse paraphrase\nviews claim that while sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are\ntrue, they should not be read as platonists read them, because we can\nparaphrase these sentences with other sentences that do not commit us\nto the existence of abstract objects. One view of this sort, known as\nif-thenism, holds that \u20183 is prime\u2019 can be\nparaphrased by \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would be\nprime\u2019 (for an early version of this sort of view, see the early\nHilbert (1899 and his letters to Frege in Frege (1980)); for later\nversions, see Putnam (1967a and 1967b) and Hellman (1989)). A second\nversion of the paraphrase strategy, which we can call\nmetamathematical formalism (see Curry (1951)), is that\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 can be paraphrased by \u201c\u20183 is\nprime\u2019 follows from the axioms of\n arithmetic\u201d.[6]\n A third version, developed by Chihara (1990), is that mathematical\nsentences that seem to make claims about what mathematical objects\nexist \u2014 e.g., \u2018There is a prime number between 2 and\n4\u2019 \u2014 can be paraphrased into sentences about what it's\npossible for us to do (in particular, what it's possible for us to\nwrite down). Others to endorse paraphrase views include Hofweber\n(2005), Rayo (2008), Moltmann (2013), and Yi (2002).\n\nOne problem with the various paraphrase views (not to put too fine a\npoint on it) is that none of the paraphrases seems very good. That is,\nthe paraphrases seem to misrepresent what we actually mean when we say\nthings like \u20183 is prime\u2019 (and by \u2018we\u2019, I mean\nboth mathematicians and ordinary folk). What we mean, it seems, is\nthat 3 is prime \u2014 not that if there were numbers, then 3 would\nbe prime, or that the sentence \u20183 is prime\u2019 follows from\nthe axioms of arithmetic, or any such thing. And notice how the\nsituation here differs from cases where we do seem to have good\nparaphrases. For instance, one might try to claim that if we endorse\nthe sentence\n\n(A1) The average accountant has two children,\n\n\nthen we are ontologically committed to the existence of the average\naccountant; but it is plausible to suppose that, in fact, we are not\nso committed, because (A1) can be paraphrased by the sentence\n\n(A2) On average, accountants have two children.\n\n\nMoreover, it seems plausible to maintain that this is a good\nparaphrase of (A1), because it seems clear that when people say things\nlike (A1), what they really mean are things like (A2). But in\nthe present case, this seems wrong: it does not seem plausible to\nsuppose that when people say \u20183 is prime\u2019, what they\nreally mean is \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would be\nprime\u2019. Again, it seems that what we mean here is, very simply,\nthat 3 is prime. In short, when people say things like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019, they do not usually have any intention to be saying\nanything other than what these sentences seem to say; and\nbecause of this, it seems that the platonist's face-value semantics\nfor mathematical discourse is correct.\n\nSome paraphrase nominalists (e.g., Chihara 1990, 2004) maintain that\nit doesn't matter what we really mean, that paraphrase\nnominalists aren't committed to the thesis that their paraphrases\ncapture the real ordinary-language meanings of our mathematical\nsentences. But this is false. If paraphrase nominalists admit that\nplatonists are right about the ordinary-language meanings of\nmathematical sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019, then their view\nwill collapse into a fictionalist view, according to which sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 are not literally true. For since\nparaphrase nominalists don't believe in the existence of mathematical\nobjects, if they admit that ordinary utterances of \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 are best interpreted as being about mathematical objects,\nor purporting to be about such objects, then they will have to admit\nthat such sentences are literally untrue, as fictionalists maintain.\nThus, if the paraphrase nominalist view is going to be a genuine\nalternative to fictionalism, it has to involve the thesis that the\nparaphrases that nominalists are offering capture the real meanings of\nordinary mathematical sentences.\n\nOn the other hand, paraphrase nominalists might try to argue that they\nare right about the ordinary-language meanings of sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019, even though this is not obvious or\ntransparent to ordinary speakers. This stance, however, would be\nextremely controversial and difficult to motivate.\n\nOne paraphrase view that has become somewhat popular recently holds\nthat sentences that seem to be about numbers are best read as being\nabout plurals. For instance, we might read \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 as\nreally saying something like this: two and two are four (or\ntwo objects and two (more) objects are four objects, or some\nsuch thing). Views of this general kind have been endorsed or defended\nby, e.g., Yi (2002, forthcoming), Hofweber (2005), and Moltmann\n(2013). This view fits better with ordinary usage than some of the\nother paraphrase-nominalist views, and for sentences like \u20182 + 2\n= 4\u2019 they can seem plausible. But when we switch to sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 \u2014 and, even worse, \u2018There\nare infinitely many primes\u2019 \u2014 they can start to seem\ncumbersome and less plausible.\n\n(For a good in-depth discussion and critique of some of the\nparaphrase-nominalist views, see Burgess and Rosen (1997).)\n\nLet's move on now to a discussion of fictionalism, which is the last\noption for nominalists. Unlike paraphrase nominalists, fictionalists\nadmit that the platonist's face-value semantics for mathematical\ndiscourse is correct; but because fictionalists don't believe in\nabstract objects, they think that mathematical sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 are not true. In other words, fictionalists maintain\nthat (a) platonists are right that sentences like \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 do purport to be about abstract objects, but (b) there\nare no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) these sentences\n\u2014 and, indeed, our mathematical theories \u2014 are untrue.\nThus, on this view, just as Alice in Wonderland is not true\nbecause there are no such things as talking rabbits, hookah-smoking\ncaterpillars, and so on, so too our mathematical theories are not true\nbecause there are no such things as numbers and sets and so\n on.[7].\n (Fictionalism has been developed by Field (1980, 1989, 1998),\nBalaguer (1998a, 2009), Rosen (2001), and Leng (2005a, 2005b, 2010).\nOne might also interpret Melia (2000), Yablo (2002a, 2002b, 2005), and\nBueno (2009) as fictionalists. Finally, Hoffman (2004) endorses a kind\nof fictionalism, but her view is very different from the one under\ndiscussion here; for a bit more on her view, see the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nThere are a few different ways that platonists might try to argue\nagainst fictionalism. The most famous and widely discussed argument\nagainst fictionalism is the Quine-Putnam indispensability\nargument (see Quine (1948, 1951), Putnam (1971, 2012), and\nColyvan (2001)). This argument (or at any rate, one version of it)\nproceeds as follows: it cannot be that mathematics is untrue, as\nfictionalists suggest, because (a) mathematics is an indispensable\npart of our physical theories (e.g., quantum mechanics, general\nrelativity theory, evolutionary theory, and so on) and so (b) if we\nwant to maintain that our physical theories are true (and surely we do\n\u2014 we don't want our disbelief in abstract objects to force us to\nbe anti-realists about natural science), then we have to maintain that\nour mathematical theories are true.\n\nFictionalists have developed two different responses to the\nQuine-Putnam argument. The first, developed by Field (1980) and\nBalaguer (1998a), is based on the claim that mathematics is, in fact,\nnot indispensable to empirical science \u2014 i.e., that our\nempirical theories can be nominalized, or reformulated in a\nway that avoids reference to abstract objects. The second response,\ndeveloped by Balaguer (1998a), Rosen (2001), Yablo (2005), Bueno\n(2009), Leng (2010), and perhaps Melia (2000), is to grant the\nindispensability of mathematics to empirical science and to simply\naccount for the relevant applications from a fictionalist point of\nview. (A counterresponse to this second response has been given by\nColyvan (2002) and Baker (2005, 2009), who argue that fictionalists\ncan\u2019t account for the explanatory role that mathematics\nplays in science; responses to the explanatory version of the\nindispensability argument have been given by Melia (2002), Leng\n(2005b), Bangu (2008), and Daly and Langford (2009).)\n\nThere is no consensus on whether the fictionalist responses to the\nQuine-Putnam argument are successful. But even if they are, there are\nother objections that platonists might raise against fictionalism. For\ninstance, one might argue that fictionalists cannot account for the\nobjectivity of mathematics (for responses to this, see Field\n(1980, 1989, 1998) and Balaguer (2009)). Or, second, one might argue\nthat fictionalism is not a nominalistically acceptable view because\nformulations of it invariably involve tacit reference to various kinds\nof abstract objects, such as sentence types, or stories, or possible\nworlds (for responses to this, see Field (1989), Balaguer (1998a), and\nRosen (2001)). For other objections to fictionalism, see, e.g.,\nMalament (1982), Shapiro (1983a), Resnik (1985), Chihara (1990,\nchapter 8, section 5), Horwich (1991), O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1997),\nBurgess and Rosen (1997), Katz (1998), Thomas (2000, 2002), Stanley\n(2002), Bueno (2003), Szabo (2003), Hoffman (2004), and Burgess\n(2004). For responses to these objections, see the various\nfictionalist works cited above, as well as Daly (2008) and Liggins\n(2010). And for a discussion of all these objections, as well as\nfictionalist responses to them, see the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nIn the end, it's not obvious whether platonists can successfully\nrefute fictionalism, and more generally, it's not obvious whether the\nversion of the singular term argument rehearsed in this subsection\nprovides a good reason for believing in abstract mathematical\nobjects.\n4.2 Propositions\n\nWe turn now to a version of the singular term argument aimed at\nestablishing the existence of propositions. Once again, the most\nimportant figure in the development of this argument is Frege (1892,\n1919). Other relevant figures (who wouldn't all endorse an argument\nlike the one sketched below) include Russell (1905, 1910\u20131911),\nChurch (1950, 1954), Quine (1956), Kaplan (1968\u201369, 1989),\nKripke (1972, 1979), Schiffer (1977, 1987, 1994), Perry (1979), Evans\n(1981), Peacocke (1981), Barwise and Perry (1983), Bealer (1982,\n1993), Zalta (1983, 1988), Katz (1986), Salmon (1986), Soames (1987,\n2014), Forbes (1987), Crimmins and Perry (1989), Richard (1990),\nCrimmins (1998), Recanati (1993, 2000), King (1995, 2014), Braun\n(1998), and Saul (1999). \n\nThe relevant sentences here are belief ascriptions, i.e., sentences\nlike \u2018Clinton believes that snow is white\u2019 and\n\u2018Emily believes that Santa Claus is fat\u2019. The first point\nto note about these sentences is that they involve\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses, where a \u2018that\u2019-clause is\nsimply the word \u2018that\u2019 added to the front of a complete\nsentence \u2014 e.g., \u2018that snow is white\u2019. The second\npoint to be made is that \u2018that\u2019-clauses, in English, are\nsingular terms. A common way to illustrate this point \u2014 see,\ne.g., Bealer (1982 and 1993) and Schiffer (1994) \u2014 is to appeal\nto arguments like the following:\n\n\n\nI.\nClinton believes that snow is white.\n\nTherefore, Clinton believes something (namely, that snow is\nwhite). \n\n\n\nThis argument seems to be valid, and platonists claim that the best\nand only tenable explanation of this fact involves a commitment to the\nidea that the \u2018that\u2019-clause in this argument, i.e.,\n\u2018that snow is white\u2019, is a singular term.\n\nBut if \u2018that\u2019-clauses are singular terms, what sorts of\nobjects do they refer to? Well, it might seem that they refer to\nfacts, or states of affairs. For instance, it might seem that\n\u2018that snow is white\u2019 refers to the fact that snow is\nwhite. This, however, is a mistake (at least in connection with the\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses that appear in belief reports). For since\nbeliefs can be false, it follows that the \u2018that\u2019-clauses\nin our belief reports refer to things that can be false. E.g., if\nSammy is seven years old, then the sentence \u2018Sammy believes that\nsnow is powdered sugar\u2019 could be true; but if this sentence is\ntrue, then (by our criterion of ontological commitment) its\n\u2018that\u2019-clause refers to a real object; but then it cannot\nrefer to a fact, because (obviously) there is no such thing as the\nfact that snow is powdered sugar.\n\nThese considerations suggest that the referents of the\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses that appear in belief ascriptions are\nthings that can be true or false. But if this is right, then it seems\nthat the objects of belief must be either sentences or propositions.\nThe standard platonist view is that they are propositions. Before we\nconsider their arguments for this claim, we need to say a few words\nabout the different kinds of sentential views that one might\nendorse.\n\nTo begin with, we need to distinguish between sentence types\nand sentence tokens. To appreciate the difference, consider\nthe following indented sentences:\n\nCats are cute.\n\nCats are cute.\n\n\nWe have here two different tokens of a single sentence type. Thus, a\ntoken is an actual physical thing, located at a specific place in\nspacetime; it is a pile of ink on a page (structured in an appropriate\nway), or a sound wave, or a collection of pixels on a computer screen,\nor something of this sort. A type, on the other hand, can be tokened\nnumerous times but is not identical with any single token. Thus, a\nsentence type is an abstract object. And so if we are looking for an\nanti-platonist view of what \u2018that\u2019-clauses refer to, or\nwhat belief reports are about, we cannot say that they're about\nsentence types; we have to say they're about sentence tokens.\n\nA second distinction that needs to be drawn here is between sentence\ntokens that are external, or public, and sentence tokens that\nare internal, or private. Examples of external sentence\ntokens were given in the last paragraph \u2014 piles of ink, sound\nwaves, and so on. An internal sentence token, on the other hand,\nexists inside a particular person's head. There is a wide-spread view\n\u2014 due mainly to Jerry Fodor (1975 and 1987) but adopted by many\nothers, e.g., Stich (1983) \u2014 that we are able to perform\ncognitive tasks (e.g., think, remember information, and have beliefs)\nonly because we are capable of storing information in our heads in a\nneural language (often called mentalese, or the language\nof thought). In connection with beliefs, the idea here is that to\nbelieve that, say, snow is white, is to have a neural sentence stored\nin your head (in a belief way, as opposed to a desire way, or some\nother way) that means in mentalese that snow is white.\n\nThis gives us two different anti-platonist alternatives to the view\nthat belief reports involve references to propositions. First, there\nis the conceptualistic (or mentalistic) view that belief reports\ninvolve references to sentences in our heads, or mentalese sentence\ntokens. And, second, there is the physicalistic view that belief\nreports involve references to external sentence tokens, i.e., to piles\nof ink, and so on (versions of this view have been endorsed by Carnap\n(1947), Davidson (1967), and Leeds (1979)).\n\nThere are a number of arguments that suggest that ordinary belief\nreports cannot be taken to be about (internal or external) sentences\nand that we have to take them to be about propositions. We will\nrehearse one such argument here, an argument that goes back at least\nto Church (1950). Suppose that Boris and Jerry both live in cold\nclimates and are very familiar with snow. Thus, they both believe that\nsnow is white. But Boris lives in Russia and speaks only Russian,\nwhereas Jerry lives in Minnesota and speaks only English. Now,\nconsider the following argument:\n\n\n\nII.\nBoris believes that snow is white.\n\nJerry believes that snow is white.\n\nTherefore, there's at least one thing that Boris and Jerry both\nbelieve, namely, that snow is white. \n\n\n\nThis argument seems clearly valid; but this seems to rule out the idea\nthat the belief reports here are about sentence tokens. For (a) in\norder to account for the validity of the argument, we have to take the\ntwo \u2018that\u2019-clauses to refer to the same thing, and (b)\nthere is no sentence token that they could both refer to. First of\nall, they couldn't refer to any external sentence token (or, for that\nmatter, any sentence type associated with any natural language),\nbecause (i) if the first \u2018that\u2019-clause refers to such a\nsentence, it would presumably be a Russian sentence, since Boris\nspeaks only\n Russian;[8]\n and (ii) if the second \u2018that\u2019-clause refers to such a\nsentence, it would presumably be an English sentence, since Jerry\nspeaks only English; and so (iii) the two \u2018that\u2019-clauses\ncannot both refer to the same external sentence token (or\nnatural-language sentence type). And second, they cannot refer to any\nmentalese sentence token, because (i) if the first\n\u2018that\u2019-clause refers to such a sentence, it would\npresumably be in Boris's head; and (ii) if the second\n\u2018that\u2019-clause refers to such a sentence, it would\npresumably be in Jerry's head; and so (iii) the two\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses cannot both refer to the same mentalese\nsentence token. Therefore, it seems to follow that the\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses in the above argument do not refer to\nsentence tokens of any kind. And since these are ordinary belief\nascriptions, it follows that, in general, the\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses that appear in ordinary belief ascriptions\ndo not refer to sentence tokens.\n\nNow as it's formulated here, this argument doesn't rule out the view\nthat \u2018that\u2019-clauses refer to mentalese sentence types, but\nthe argument can be extended to rule out that view as well (e.g., one\nmight do this by talking not of an American and a Russian but of two\ncreatures with different internal languages of thought). I won't run\nthrough the details of this here, since, as we've seen,\nanti-platonists can't claim that \u2018that\u2019-clauses refer to\ntypes anyway, because types are abstract objects. But if we assume\nthat that version of the argument is cogent as well, then it follows\nthat \u2018that\u2019-clauses don't refer to sentences of any kind\nat all and, hence, that they must refer to\n propositions.[9]\n\nNow, notice that the issue so far has been purely semantic. What the\nabove argument suggests is that regardless of whether there are any\nsuch things as propositions, our \u2018that\u2019-clauses are best\ninterpreted as purporting to refer to such objects. Platonists then\nclaim that if this is correct, then there must be such things as\npropositions, because, clearly, many of our belief ascriptions are\ntrue. For instance, \u2018Clinton believes that snow is white\u2019\nis true; thus, if the above analysis of \u2018that\u2019-clauses is\ncorrect, and if our criterion of ontological commitment is correct, it\nfollows that there is such a thing as the proposition that snow is\nwhite.\n\nThis version of the singular term argument might seem even more\npowerful than the mathematical-object version of the singular term\nargument sketched in\n section 4.1,\n because in this case, it doesn't seem that there is as much room for\nparaphrase nominalism. We saw in\n section 4.1\n that there are a number of programs for paraphrasing the statements\nof mathematics, but there are no obvious strategies for paraphrasing\nordinary belief ascriptions. One might think this could be done by\ntaking sentences of the form \u2018S believes that\np\u2019 to mean \u2018If there existed propositions, then\nS would believe that p\u2019; but this sort of view\nis even less plausible here than it is in the mathematical case. It is\njust wildly implausible to suppose that when common folk say things\nlike \u2018Clinton believes that his presidency was\nsuccessful\u2019, they mean to be making hypothetical claims about\nwhat the person in question would believe in some alternate\nsituation.\n\nHowever, while paraphrase nominalism seems hopeless in the case of\npropositions, Balaguer (1998b) has argued that fictionalistic\nnominalism carries over very well to the case of propositions. More\nspecifically, fictionalists can say that \u2018Clinton believes that\nsnow is white\u2019 is strictly speaking not true (because its\n\u2018that\u2019-clause is supposed to refer to a proposition, and\nthere are no such things as propositions) but that we can still use it\nto say something essentially accurate about Clinton's belief state,\nbecause there are facts about Clinton that make it the case that if\nthere existed propositions, then it would be true that he believes\nthat snow is white.\n4.3 Properties and Relations\n\nOne way to argue for a platonistic view of properties and relations is\nfirst to use the argument of\n section 4.2\n to argue for a platonistic view of propositions, and then to claim\nthat this argument already contains an argument for properties and\nrelations, because properties and relations are components of\npropositions. If we adopt a Russellian view of propositions, this is\nstraightforward, because it is built into the Russellian view that\npropositions are composed of objects, properties, and relations (see\n section 1).\n If we adopt a Fregean view of propositions, however, the situation is\ndifferent. On the Fregean view, propositions are composed of senses,\nwhich we can think of as meanings, or concepts. Now, Frege himself did\nnot use the word \u2018concept\u2019 to talk about these things\n\u2014 he used the German \u2018sinn\u2019, which is usually\ntranslated as \u2018sense\u2019 \u2014 but we can use the word\n\u2018concept\u2019 here. On this way of talking, we can say that on\na Fregean view, if we have good reason to countenance the existence\nof, e.g., the proposition that roses are red, then we also have good\nreason to countenance the existence of the concept red. Now,\nsome Fregeans might want to say that the property of redness just\nis the concept of redness, and if so, then they could\nmaintain with Russellians that if there exist propositions, then there\nalso exist properties and relations. But most Fregeans would want to\ndeny that properties are concepts, so in order to motivate a\nplatonistic view of properties and relations, they would need an\nentirely different argument. And since we have already found that the\nOne Over Many argument for properties and relations is not cogent,\nthis other argument would presumably be a version of the singular term\nargument, one that was aimed specifically at establishing the\nexistence of properties and relations.\n\nThe most obvious way to formulate an independent property-and-relation\nversion of the singular term argument would be to appeal to sentences\nlike\n\n(P1) Mars possesses the property of redness\n\n\nand\n\n(R1) San Francisco stands in the north-of relation to Los Angeles.\n\n\nIn order to make out a version of the singular term argument here,\nplatonists would need to begin by arguing that these sentences commit\nus to the existence of the property of redness and the north-of\nrelation, respectively, because (a) they have singular terms that\ndenote those things, and (b) they are true. In order to motivate claim\n(a), platonists would have to refute the paraphrase-nominalist claim\nthat sentences like (P1) and (R1) are equivalent to sentences like\n\u2018Mars is red\u2019 and \u2018San Francisco is north of Los\nAngeles\u2019 and that none of these sentences entails the existence\nof properties or relations. And in order to motivate claim (b),\nplatonists would have to refute the fictionalist view that sentences\nlike (P1) and (R1) are untrue because they do entail the existence of\nproperties and relations and because there are no such things as\nproperties or relations (of course, fictionalists maintain that while\n(P1) and (R1) aren't literally true, they can still be used\ncolloquially to say things that about the world that are essentially\naccurate \u2014 see\n section 3).[10]\n\nIf platonists managed to establish the existence of properties and\nrelations in this way, they would still need to argue that such things\ncould only be abstract objects. That is, they would have to argue that\nproperties and relations are not ideas (as conceptualists claim) or\nuniversals inhering in physical things (as immanent realists\nclaim).\n\nThe arguments listed above against conceptualistic or psychologistic\nviews of numbers also tell against conceptualism about properties and\nrelations. For instance, as Russell (1912, chapter IX) points out,\nproperty claims and relational claims seem to be objective; e.g., the\nfact that Mount Everest is taller than Mont Blanc is a fact that holds\nindependently of us; but conceptualism about universals entails that\nif we all died, it would no longer be true that Mount Everest bears\nthe taller than relation to Mont Blanc, because that relation would no\nlonger exist. And, second, conceptualism seems simply to get the\nsemantics of our property discourse wrong, for it seems to confuse\nproperties with our ideas of them. The English sentence \u2018Red is\na color\u2019 does not seem to be about anybody's idea of redness; it\nseems to be about redness, the actual color, which, it seems, is\nsomething objective.\n\nThere are also some very famous arguments against the immanent realist\nview of properties and relations. First, it is not clear that it is\ncoherent to say that there is such a thing as redness and that this\none thing exists in many different objects at the same time.\nSecond, it is not clear what it is for an object to possess a property\non the immanent realist view. Most immanent realists would not say\nthat property possession is a full-blown relation, for this\nwould just be another universal, and it is commonly thought that if\nimmanent realists adopted this view, it would lead to an unacceptable\ninfinite regress. (If we're told that an object a possesses\nFness iff a stands in the possession relation to\nFness, then one might ask, \u201cWhat is it for an object\nand a property to stand in the possession relation to one\nanother?\u201d, and so on. For more on this, see the entry on\n properties.)\n In light of this, many immanent realists maintain that when an object\na possesses a property Fness, a and\nFness are \u201clinked together\u201d in some\nnon-relational way, e.g., a way that is more intimate, or primitive,\nthan ordinary relational connections. But it is not clear what this\nreally amounts to. (Immanent realists might respond that platonists\nalso have a problem here \u2014 i.e., that platonists also have to\nprovide an account of the relation, or \u201cconnection\u201d,\nbetween objects and properties. But some platonists might argue that\nthe problem isn't as bad for them because platonistic properties are\ncausally inert, and so they are not responsible in any way\nfor objects having the natures they have, and they do not play any\nimportant role in our explanations of why objects have the\nnatures they have. For instance, if a is F,\nFness is not responsible in any way for a having the\nnature that it has. Thus, platonists might claim that a is\nsimply an example of Fness and that there is no more\nto their relation than\n that.[11]\n Immanent realists, however, think that ordinary physical objects are\nthe way they are because they possess the properties they do.\nThus, they seem committed to the thesis that there is some sort of\nphysically substantial connection, or link, between objects and their\nproperties, and it is not at all clear what this could be. There has\nbeen a lot of philosophy dedicated to this problem, but there is no\nconsensus on how (or whether) it can be solved.)\n\nIt is worth noting that platonists who argue for properties and\nrelations in conjunction with propositions \u2014 i.e., by first\narguing for propositions and then claiming that properties and\nrelations are components of propositions \u2014 will have an easier\ntime arguing that properties and relations couldn't exist in our minds\n(as conceptualists say) or in things (as immanent realists say). In\nconnection with conceptualism, platonists of this sort could claim\nthat the argument given in\n section 4.2\n for thinking that \u2018that\u2019-clauses don't refer to mentalese\nsentence tokens suggests that propositions (which are the referents of\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses) could not be made up of properties that\nexist in our heads. And in connection with immanent realism,\nplatonists of this sort could argue that propositions couldn't be\ncomposed of immanent-realist properties, because people can believe\npropositions that are composed of properties that are not instantiated\nin the physical world. For instance, it seems that sentences like\n\u2018Johnny believes that there is a four-hundred-story building in\nSally's backyard\u2019 can be true, and so according to the above\nplatonist argument for propositions, there must be such a thing as the\nproposition that there is a four-hundred-story building in Sally's\nbackyard. But if propositions have properties as components, then this\nproposition has as a component the property of being a\nfour-hundred-story building. But if properties exist only in physical\nthings, as immanent realists suggest, then there is no such thing as\nthe property of being a four-hundred-story building, since presumably,\nnothing in the universe has this property. Thus, the conclusion here\nis that if propositions have properties as components, then the\nproperties in question have to be transcendent, platonist properties,\nnot immanent\n properties.[12]\n4.4 Sentence Types\n\nLinguistics is a branch of science that tells us things about\nsentences. For instance, it says things like\n\n(A) \u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019 is a well-formed sentence of\nEnglish,\n\n\nand\n\n(B) \u2018Visiting relatives can be boring\u2019 is structurally\nambiguous.\n\n\nThe quoted sentences that appear in (A) and (B) are singular terms;\ne.g., \u201c\u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019\u201d refers to the\nsentence \u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019, and (A) says of this\nsentence that it has a certain property, namely, that of being a\nwell-formed English sentence. Thus, if sentences like (A) are true\n\u2014 and it certainly seems that they are \u2014 then they commit\nus to believing in the existence of sentences. Now, one might hold a\nphysicalistic view here according to which linguistics is about actual\n(external) sentence tokens, e.g., piles of ink and verbal sound waves.\n(This view was popular in the early part of the 20th\ncentury \u2014 see, e.g., Bloomfield (1933), Harris (1954), and Quine\n(1953).) Or alternatively, one might hold a conceptualistic view,\nmaintaining that linguistics is essentially a branch of psychology;\nthe main proponent of this view is Noam Chomsky (1965, chapter 1), who\nthinks of a grammar for a natural language as being about an ideal\nspeaker-hearer's knowledge of the given language, but see also Sapir\n(1921), Stich (1972), and Fodor (1981). But there are reasons for\nthinking that neither the physicalist nor the conceptualist approach\nis tenable and that the only plausible way to interpret linguistic\ntheory is as being about sentence types, which of course, are abstract\nobjects (proponents of the platonistic view include Katz (1981),\nSoames (1985), and Langendoen and Postal (1985)). Katz constructs\narguments here that are very similar to the ones we considered above,\nin connection with mathematical objects\n (section 4.1).\n One argument here is that linguistic theory seems to have\nconsequences that are (a) true and (b) about sentences that have never\nbeen tokened (internally or externally), e.g., sentences like\n\u2018Green Elvises slithered unwittingly toward Arizona's favorite\ntoaster\u2019. (Of course, now that I've written this sentence down,\nit has been tokened, but it seems likely that before I wrote it down,\nit had never been tokened.) Standard linguistic theory entails that\nmany sentences that have never been tokened (internally or externally)\nare well-formed English sentences. Thus, if we want to claim that our\nlinguistic theories are true, then we have to accept these\nconsequences, or theorems, of linguistic theory. But these theorems\nare clearly not true of any sentence tokens (because the sentences in\nquestion have never been tokened) and so, it is argued, they must be\ntrue of sentence types.\n4.5 Possible Worlds\n\nIt is a very widely held view among contemporary philosophers that we\nneed to appeal to entities known as possible worlds in order\nto account for various phenomena. There are dozens of phenomena that\nphilosophers have thought should be explained in terms of possible\nworlds, but to name just one, it is often argued that semantic theory\nis best carried out in terms of possible worlds. Consider, for\nexample, the attempt to state the truth conditions of sentences of the\nform \u2018It is necessary that S\u2019 and \u2018It is\npossible that S\u2019 (where S is any sentence). It\nis widely believed that the best theory here is that a sentence of the\nform \u2018It is necessary that S\u2019 is true if and only\nif S is true in all possible worlds, and a sentence of the\nform \u2018It is possible that S\u2019 is true if and only\nif S is true in at least one possible world. Now, if we add\nto this theory the premise that at least one sentence of the form\n\u2018It is possible that S\u2019 is true \u2014 and this\nseems undeniable \u2014 then we are led to the result that possible\nworlds exist.\n\nNow, as was the case with numbers, properties, and sentences, not\neveryone who endorses possible worlds thinks that they are abstract\nobjects; indeed, one leading proponent of the use of possible worlds\nin philosophy and semantics \u2014 namely, David Lewis (1986) \u2014\nmaintains that possible worlds are of the same kind as the actual\nworld, and so he takes them to be concrete objects. However, most\nphilosophers who endorse possible worlds take them to be abstract\nobjects (see, e.g., Plantinga (1974, 1976), Adams (1974), Chisholm\n(1976), and Pollock (1984)). It is important to note, however, that\npossible worlds are very often not taken to constitute a new kind of\nabstract object. For instance, it is very popular to maintain that a\npossible world is just a set of propositions. (To see how a set of\npropositions could serve as a possible world, notice that if you\nbelieved in full-blown possible worlds \u2014 worlds that are just\nlike the actual world in kind \u2014 then you would say that\ncorresponding to each of these worlds, there is a set of propositions\nthat completely and accurately describes the given world, or is true\nof that world. Many philosophers who don't believe in full-blown\npossible worlds maintain that these sets of propositions are good\nenough \u2014 i.e., that we can take them to be possible\nworlds.) Or alternatively, one might think of a possible world as a\nstate of affairs, or as a way things could be. In so\ndoing, one might think of these as constituting a new kind of abstract\nobject, or one might think of them as properties \u2014 giant,\ncomplex properties that the entire universe may or may not possess.\nFor instance, one might say that the actual universe possesses the\nproperty of being such that snow is white and grass is green and San\nFrancisco is north of Los Angeles, and so on.\n\nIn any event, if possible worlds are indeed abstract objects, and if\nthe above argument for the existence of possible worlds is cogent,\nthen this would give us another argument for platonism.\n4.6 Logical Objects\n\nFrege (1884, 1893\u20131903) appealed to sentences like the\nfollowing:\n\n(D) The number of Fs is identical to the number of\nGs if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the Fs and the Gs.\n\n\n(E) The direction of line a is identical to the direction of\nline b if and only if a is parallel to\nb.\n\n(F) The shape of figure a is identical to the shape of figure\nb if and only if a is geometrically similar\nto b.\n\n\nOn Frege's view, principles like these are true, and so they commit us\nto the existence of numbers, lines, and shapes. Now, of course, we\nhave already gone through a platonistic argument \u2014 indeed, a\nFregean argument \u2014 for the existence of numbers. Moreover, the\nstandard platonist view is that the argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects is entirely general, covering all branches of\nmathematics, including geometry, so that on this view, we already have\nreason to believe in lines and shapes, as well as numbers. But it is\nworth noting that in contrast to most contemporary platonists, Frege\nthought of numbers, lines, and shapes as logical objects, because on\nhis view, these things can be identified with extensions of\nconcepts. What is the extension of a concept? Well, simplifying a\nbit, it is just the set of things falling under the given concept.\nThus, for instance, the extension of the concept white is\njust the set of white\n things.[13]\n And so the idea here is that since logic is centrally concerned with\npredicates and their corresponding concepts, and since extensions are\ntied to concepts, we can think of extensions as logical objects. Thus,\nsince Frege thinks that numbers, lines, and shapes can be identified\nwith extensions, on his view, we can think of these things as logical\nobjects.\n\nFrege's definitions of numbers, lines, and shapes in terms of\nextensions can be formulated as follows: (i) the number of Fs\nis the extension of the concept equinumerous with F (that is,\nit is the set of all concepts that have exactly as many objects\nfalling under them as does F); and (ii) the direction of line\na is the extension of the concept parallel to a; and\n(iii) the shape of figure a is the extension of the concept\ngeometrically similar to a. A similar approach can be used to\ndefine other kinds of logical objects. For instance, the truth value\nof the proposition p can be identified with the extension of\nthe concept equivalent to p (i.e., the concept true if\nand only if p is true).\n\nIt should be noted that contemporary neo-Fregeans reject the\nidentification of directions and shapes and so on with extensions of\nconcepts. They hold instead that directions and shapes are sui\ngeneris abstract objects.\n\nFor contemporary work on this issue, see, e.g., Wright (1983), Boolos\n(1986\u201387), and Anderson and Zalta (2004).\n4.7 Fictional Objects\n\nFinally, a number of philosophers (see, most notably, van Inwagen\n(1977), Wolterstorff (1980), and Zalta (1983, 1988)) think that\nfictional objects, or fictional characters, are best thought of as\nabstract objects. (Salmon (1998) and Thomasson (1999) also take\nfictional objects to be abstract, but their views are a bit different;\nthey maintain that abstract fictional objects are created by humans.)\nTo see why one might be drawn to this view, consider the following\nsentence:\n\n(G) Sherlock Holmes is a detective.\n\n\nNow, if this sentence actually appeared in one of the Holmes stories\nby Arthur Conan Doyle, then that token of it would not be true \u2014\nit would be a bit of fiction. But if you were telling a child about\nthese stories, and the child asked, \u201cWhat does Holmes do for a\nliving?\u201d, and you answered by uttering (G), then it seems\nplausible to suppose that what you have said is true. But if it is\ntrue, then it seems that its singular term, \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019, must refer to something. What it refers to, according\nto the view in question, is an abstract object, in particular, a\nfictional character. In short, present-day utterances of (G) are true\nstatements about a fictional character; but if Doyle had put (G) into\none his stories, it would not have been true, and its singular term\nwould not have referred to anything.\n\nThere is a worry about this view that can be put in the following way:\nif there is such a thing as Sherlock Holmes, then it has arms and\nlegs; but if Sherlock Holmes is an abstract object, as this view\nsupposes, then it does not have arms and legs (because abstract\nobjects are non-physical); therefore, it cannot be the case that\nSherlock Holmes exists and is an abstract object, for this leads to\ncontradiction. Various solutions to this problem have been proposed.\nFor instance, Zalta argues that in addition to exemplifying\ncertain properties, abstract objects also encode properties.\nThe fictional character Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of\nbeing a detective, being male, being English, having arms and legs,\nand so on. But it does not exemplify any of these properties. It\nexemplifies the properties of being abstract, being a fictional\ncharacter, having been thought of first by Arthur Conan Doyle, and so\non. Zalta maintains that in English, the copula \u2018is\u2019\n\u2014 as in \u2018a is F\u2019 \u2014 is\nambiguous; it can be read as ascribing either property exemplification\nor property encoding. When we say \u2018Sherlock Holmes is a\ndetective\u2019, we are saying that Holmes encodes the\nproperty of being a detective; and when we say \u2018Sherlock Holmes\nis a fictional character\u2019, we are saying that Holmes\nexemplifies the property of being a fictional character. (It\nshould be noted that Zalta employs the device of encoding with respect\nto all abstract objects \u2014 mathematical objects, logical objects,\nand so on \u2014 not just fictional objects. Also, Zalta points out\nthat his theory of encoding is based on a similar theory developed by\nErnst Mally (1912).)\n\nThose who endorse a platonistic view of fictional objects maintain\nthat there is no good paraphrase of sentences like (G), but one might\nquestion this. For instance, one might maintain that (G) can be\nparaphrased by a sentence like this:\n\n\u2018Sherlock Holmes is a detective\u2019 is\ntrue-in-the-Holmes-stories.\n\n\nIf we read (G) in this way, then it is not about Sherlock Holmes at\nall; rather, it is about the Sherlock Holmes stories. Thus, in order\nto believe (G), so interpreted, one would have to believe in the\nexistence of these stories. Now, one might try to take an\nanti-platonistic view of the nature of stories, but there are problems\nwith such views, and so we might end up with a platonistic view here\nanyway \u2014 a view that takes sentences like (G) to be about\nstories and stories to be abstract objects of some sort, e.g., ordered\nsets of\n propositions.[14]\n Which of these platonistic views is superior can be settled by\ndetermining which (if either) captures the correct interpretation of\nsentences like (G) \u2014 i.e., by determining whether ordinary\npeople who utter sentences like (G) are best interpreted as talking\nabout stories or fictional characters.\n\nIt should be noted that some people who take fictional characters to\nbe abstract objects (e.g., Thomasson 1999) would actually agree with\nthe idea that (G) should be read in the above way \u2014 i.e., as a\nclaim about the Sherlock Holmes stories and not about Sherlock Holmes\nhimself. Thomasson\u2019s main argument for believing in fictional\ncharacters is based not on sentences like (G) but rather on sentences\nlike the following:\n\n(H) Some 19th century heroines are better developed than any 18th\ncentury heroines.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how to paraphrase this as being about a story,\nor even a bunch of stories. But, of course, one could still endorse a\nfictionalist (i.e., an error-theoretic) view of sentences like (H). In\nother words, one could admit that (H) is a claim about fictional\ncharacters and then one could claim that since there are no such\nthings as fictional characters, (H) is simply not true, although of\ncourse it might be true-in-the-story-of-fictional-characters,\nwhere this just means that it would have been true if there had been a\nrealm of fictional characters of the sort that platonists believe in.\n(Brock (2002) endorses a fictionalist view of fictional characters\nthat's similar in spirit to the view alluded to here.) \n5. The Epistemological Argument Against Platonism\n\nOver the years, anti-platonist philosophers have presented a number of\narguments against platonism. One of these arguments stands out as the\nstrongest, namely, the epistemological argument. This argument goes\nall the way back to Plato, but it has received renewed interest since\n1973, when Paul Benacerraf presented a version of the argument. Most\nof the work on this problem has taken place in the philosophy of\nmathematics, in connection with the platonistic view of mathematical\nobjects like numbers. We will therefore discuss the argument in this\ncontext, but all of the issues and arguments can be reproduced in\nconnection with other kinds of abstract objects. The argument can be\nput in the following way:\n\nHuman beings exist entirely within spacetime.\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then they do not\nexist in spacetime. Therefore, it seems very plausible that:\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then human\nbeings could not attain knowledge of them. Therefore,\nIf mathematical platonism is correct, then human beings could not\nattain mathematical knowledge.\nHuman beings have mathematical knowledge. Therefore,\nMathematical platonism is not correct.\n\n\nThe argument for (3) is everything here. If it can be established,\nthen so can (6), because (3) trivially entails (4), (5) is beyond\ndoubt, and (4) and (5) trivially entail (6). Now, (1) and (2) do not\nstrictly entail (3), and so there is room for platonists to maneuver\nhere \u2014 and as we'll see, this is precisely how most platonists\nhave responded. However, it is important to notice that (1) and (2)\nprovide a strong prima facie motivation for (3), because they\nseem to imply that mathematical objects (if there are such things) are\ntotally inaccessible to us, i.e., that information cannot pass from\nmathematical objects to human beings. But this gives rise to a\nprima facie worry (which may or may not be answerable) about\nwhether human beings could acquire knowledge of mathematical objects.\nThus, we should think of this argument not as refuting\nplatonism but as issuing a challenge to platonists. The challenge is\nsimply to explain how human beings could acquire knowledge of abstract\nmathematical objects.\n\nThere are three ways for platonists to respond. First, they can argue\nthat (1) is false and that the human mind is capable of somehow\nforging contact with abstract mathematical objects and thereby\nacquiring information about such objects. This strategy has been\npursued by Plato in The Meno and The Phaedo, and by\nG\u00f6del (1964). Plato's idea is that our immaterial souls acquired\nknowledge of abstract objects before we were born and that\nmathematical learning is really just a process of coming to remember\nwhat we knew before we were born. On G\u00f6del's version of the view,\nwe acquire knowledge of abstract objects in much the same way that we\nacquire knowledge of concrete physical objects; more specifically,\njust as we acquire information about physical objects via the faculty\nof sense perception, so we acquire information about abstract objects\nby means of a faculty of mathematical intuition. Now, other\nphilosophers have endorsed the idea that we possess a faculty of\nmathematical intuition, but G\u00f6del's version of this view \u2014\nand he seems to be alone in this \u2014 involves the idea that the\nmind is non-physical in some sense and that we are capable of forging\ncontact with, and acquiring information from, non-physical\nmathematical\n objects.[15]\n This view has been almost universally rejected. One problem is that\ndenying (1) doesn't seem to help. The idea of an immaterial mind\nreceiving information from an abstract object seems just as mysterious\nand confused as the idea of a physical brain receiving information\nfrom an abstract object.\n\nThe second strategy that platonists can pursue in responding to the\nepistemological argument is to argue that (2) is false and that human\nbeings can acquire information about mathematical objects via normal\nperceptual means. The early Maddy (1990) pursued this idea in\nconnection with set theory, claiming that sets of physical objects can\nbe taken to exist in spacetime and, hence, that we can perceive them.\nFor instance, on her view, if there are two books on a table, then the\nset containing these books exists on the table, in the same place that\nthe books exist, and we can see the set and acquire information about\nit in this way. This view has been subjected to much criticism,\nincluding arguments from the later Maddy (1997). Others to attack the\nview include Lavine (1992), Dieterle and Shapiro (1993), Balaguer\n(1998a), Milne (1994), Riskin (1994), and Carson (1996).\n\nIt may be objected that according to the definitions we've been using,\nviews like Maddy's are not versions of platonism at all, because they\ndo not take mathematical objects to exist outside of spacetime.\nNonetheless, there is some rationale for thinking of Maddy's view as a\nsort of non-traditional platonism. For since Maddy's view entails that\nthere is an infinity of sets associated with every ordinary physical\nobject, all sharing the same spatiotemporal location and the same\nphysical matter, she has to allow that these sets differ from one\nanother in some sort of non-physical way and, hence, that there is\nsomething about these sets that is non-physical, or perhaps abstract,\nin some sense of these terms. Now, of course, the question of whether\nMaddy's view counts as a version of platonism is purely\nterminological; but whatever we say about this, the view is still\nworth considering in the present context, because it is widely thought\nof as one of the available responses to the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism, and indeed, that is the spirit in which Maddy\noriginally presented the view.\n\nThe third and final strategy that platonists can pursue is to accept\n(1) and (2) and explain why (3) is nonetheless false. This strategy is\ndifferent from the first two in that it doesn't involve the\npostulation of an information-transferring contact between human\nbeings and abstract objects. The idea here is to grant that human\nbeings do not have such contact with abstract objects and to explain\nhow they can nonetheless acquire knowledge of such objects. This has\nbeen the most popular strategy among contemporary platonists. Its\nadvocates include Quine (1951, section 6), Steiner (1975, chapter 4),\nParsons (1980, 1994), Katz (1981, 1998), Resnik (1982, 1997), Wright\n(1983), Lewis (1986, section 2.4), Hale (1987), Shapiro (1989, 1997),\nBurgess (1990), Balaguer (1995, 1998a), Linsky and Zalta (1995),\nBurgess and Rosen (1997), and Linnebo (2006). There are several\ndifferent versions of this view; we will look very briefly at the most\nprominent of them.\n\nOne version of the third strategy, implicit in the writings of Quine\n(1951, section 6) and developed by Steiner (1975, chapter four,\nespecially section IV) and Resnik (1997, chapter 7), is to argue that\nwe have good reason to believe that our mathematical theories are\ntrue, even though we don't have any contact with mathematical objects,\nbecause (a) these theories are embedded in our empirical theories, and\n(b) these empirical theories (including their mathematical parts) have\nbeen confirmed by empirical evidence, and so (c) we have empirical\nevidence for believing that our mathematical theories are true and,\nhence, that abstract mathematical objects exist. Notice that this view\ninvolves the controversial thesis that confirmation is\nholistic, i.e., that entire theories are confirmed by pieces of\nevidence that seem to confirm only parts of theories. One might doubt\nthat confirmation is holistic in this way (see, e.g., Sober (1993),\nMaddy (1992), and Balaguer (1998a)). Moreover, even if one grants that\nconfirmation is holistic, one might worry that this view leaves\nunexplained the fact that mathematicians are capable of acquiring\nknowledge of their theories before these theories are applied in\nempirical science.\n\nA second version of the third strategy, developed by Katz (1981, 1998)\nand Lewis (1986, section 2.4), is to argue that we can know that our\nmathematical theories are true, without any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with mathematical objects, because\nthese theories are necessarily true. The reason we need\ninformation-transferring contact with ordinary physical objects in\norder to know what they're like is that these objects could have been\ndifferent. For instance, we have to look at fire engines in order to\nknow that they're red, because they could have been blue. But we don't\nneed any contact with the number 4 in order to know that it is the sum\nof 3 and 1, because it is necessarily the sum of 3 and 1. (For\ncriticisms of this view, see Field (1989, pp. 233\u201338) and\nBalaguer (1998a, chapter 2, section 6.4).)\n\nA third version of the third strategy has been developed by Resnik\n(1997) and Shapiro (1997). Both of these philosophers endorse\n(platonistic) structuralism, a view that holds that our\nmathematical theories provide true descriptions of mathematical\nstructures, which, according to this view, are abstract. Moreover,\nResnik and Shapiro both claim that human beings can acquire knowledge\nof mathematical structures (without coming into any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with such things) by simply\nconstructing mathematical axiom systems; for, they argue, axiom\nsystems provide implicit definitions of structures. One\nproblem with this view, however, is that it does not explain how we\ncould know which of the various axiom systems that we might formulate\nactually pick out structures that exist in the mathematical realm.\n\nA fourth and final version of the third strategy, developed\nindependently (and somewhat differently) by Balaguer (1995, 1998a) and\nLinsky & Zalta (1995), is based on the adoption of a particular\nversion of platonism called plenitudinous platonism (Balaguer\nalso calls it full-blooded platonism, or FBP, and Linsky and\nZalta call it principled platonism). Balaguer defines\nplenitudinous platonism (somewhat roughly) as the view that there\nexist mathematical objects of all possible kinds, or the view that all\nthe mathematical objects that possibly could exist actually do exist.\nBut, in general, Balaguer would define a different plenitude principle\nfor every different kind of abstract object. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop plenitudinous platonism by proposing a distinctive plenitude\nprinciple for each of three basic domains of abstracta: abstract\nindividuals, relations (properties and propositions), and contingently\nnonconcrete individuals (1995, 554). For example, on their view, the\nplenitude principle for abstract individuals asserts (again, somewhat\nroughly) that every possible description of an object characterizes an\nabstract object that encodes \u2014 and, thus, in an important sense,\nhas \u2014 the properties expressed in the description. \n\nBalaguer and Linsky & Zalta then argue that if platonists endorse\nplenitudinous platonism, they can solve the epistemological problem\nwith platonism without positing any sort of information-transferring\ncontact between human beings and abstract objects. Balaguer's version\nof the argument proceeds as follows. Since plenitudinous platonism, or\nFBP, says that there are mathematical objects of all possible kinds,\nit follows that if FBP is true, then every purely mathematical theory\nthat could possibly be true (i.e., that's internally consistent)\naccurately describes some collection of actually existing mathematical\nobjects. Thus, it follows from FBP that in order to attain knowledge\nof abstract mathematical objects, all we have to do is come up with an\ninternally consistent purely mathematical theory (and know that it is\nconsistent). But it seems clear that (i) we humans are\ncapable of formulating internally consistent mathematical theories\n(and of knowing that they are internally consistent), and (ii) being\nable to do this does not require us to have any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with the abstract objects that the\ntheories in question are about. Thus, if this is right, then the\nepistemological problem with platonism has been solved.\n\nOne might object here that in order for humans to acquire knowledge of\nabstract objects in this way, they would first need to know that\nplenitudinous platonism is true. Linsky & Zalta respond to this by\narguing that plenitudinous platonism (or in their lingo, principled\nplatonism) is knowable a priori because it is required for\nour understanding of any possible scientific theory: it alone is\ncapable of accounting for the mathematics that could be used in\nempirical science no matter what the physical world was like.\nBalaguer's response, on the other hand, is based on the claim that to\ndemand that platonists explain how humans could know that FBP is true\nis exactly analogous to demanding that external-world realists (i.e.,\nthose who believe that there is a real physical world, existing\nindependently of us and our thinking) explain how human beings could\nknow that there is an external world of a kind that gives rise to\naccurate sense perceptions. Thus, Balaguer argues that while there may\nbe some sort of Cartesian-style skeptical argument against FBP here\n(analogous to skeptical arguments against external-world realism), the\nargument in (1)\u2013(6) is supposed to be a different kind of\nargument, and in order to respond to that argument, FBP-ists do not\nhave to explain how humans could know that FBP is true.\n",
