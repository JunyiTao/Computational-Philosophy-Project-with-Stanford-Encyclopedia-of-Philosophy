    "main_text": "Causalism and Causal Theories of Action || Mental states as the causal explanans of actions\n2.3 Mental states as the causal explanans of actions\n\nThe idea that an action is rationalized by its mental states is still\nvery popular; much less so is the view that the only relevant states\nare beliefs and desires (though see Sinhababu 2017 for a modern\ndefense of this simple \u201dHumean\u201c account). As Bratman\n(1987) argues, desires do not have the conduct-controlling and\nsettling functions characteristic of intentions, and thus intentions\nseem to be better placed to be at the center of an account in which\nintentional actions are constituted by their causal genesis. My desire\nto have my teeth cleaned, when conjoined with my belief that in order\nto get my teeth cleaned I need to go to a dentist, will not result in\nmy moving towards the dentist until I actually intend to go\nto the dentist. In fact, when Velleman comes to dub this kind of\ncausal theory of action \u201dthe standard story of action\u201c, he\nexplicitly describes the view as one in which intention plays a\ncentral role between the \u201dprimary reason\u201c and the action.\nIn the standard story, the agent\u2019s \u201ddesire for the end,\nand his belief in the action as a means \u2026 jointly cause an\nintention to take it, which in turn causes the corresponding\nmovements of the agent\u2019s body.\u201c (Velleman 1992, 461).\nDavidson (1970b) himself came to accept that intentions play an\nimportant role in the causation and constitution of action and that\nintentions could not be reduced to beliefs or desires. But common to\nall these views is the idea that human actions are events that bear\nthe right kind of causal relation to certain mental states or events\nof the agent that also explain the action.\n\nOne alternative to the causal view understands agency as a form of\nirreducible agent-causation. Chisholm (1964) presents a classic\nversion of the view; Alvarez and Hyman (1998) presents a radically\ndifferent version which denies that agents cause the actions\nthemselves; Mayr (2011) develops a version of the view that, unlike\nChisholm\u2019s version, tries to show that human agency is not\nessentially different from other forms of substance causation that we\nfind in the natural world. A second alternative sees intentional\nexplanations as teleological rather than causal explanations (Wilson\n1980; Cleveland 1997; Schueler 2003; Sehon 2005); that is, an\nintentional explanation cites the goal, the purpose, or the reason for\nwhich the agent acted rather than the antecedent causes of\nthe action. Defenders of this view also try to provide an\nunderstanding of the teleological structure of intentional action that\ndenies that teleological explanations reduce to causal explanations;\nthey are instead a sui generis form of explanation. One way\nthis view can meet Davidson\u2019s Challenge is to argue that the\ntruth of certain counterfactuals distinguishes potential reasons from\nthe actual reasons. For instance, it could be true that even though\nthe fact that the asparagus was delicious was a potential reason for\nMary to eat asparagus, she would not have eaten them if they were not\nhealthy and she would have eaten them even if they were not delicious\n(L\u00f6hrer and Sehon 2016); such counterfactuals, on this view, are\nnot grounded on causal relations between mental states and the bodily\nmovements, but on the teleological structures that constitute\nintentional action. Finally, the causal account also contrasts with\nthe neo-Aristotelian view in which human action is constituted,\nroughly, by a special form of practical knowledge (Anscombe 1957); on\nthis view, in intentional action, \u201dknowledge is the [formal]\ncause of what it understands\u201c (see section 4 of this entry).\n",
