    "main_text": "The Tractatus Politicus || Metaphysical Background\n4.1 Metaphysical Background\n\n\nIn the early chapters of the TP, Spinoza puts forth his naturalistic\nprogram, beginning with the premise that the state, like everything\nelse, is a natural thing (res naturalis), governed by the\nlaws of nature (see Bartuschat 1984, 30). It is in this light that we\ncan appreciate Spinoza\u2019s claim that \u201cone should not look for the\ncauses and natural foundations of the state in the teachings of\nreason\u201d (1/7). It has seemed to some (e.g., Wernham 1958, 265n)\nthat this statement indicates a sharp break with the contractarian\nconception of the state formation advanced in the TTP. This view is\nsupported by the fact that virtually no mention of a social contract\nis made in the later treatise (Wernham 1958, 25; Matheron 1990). This\nwould also fit with Lewis Feuer\u2019s suggestion that the later treatise\nbetrays a dimmer view of the masses, perhaps brought on by the events\nof 1672 (1987, ch. 5). At the very least, this passage illustrates a\nbreak with the ultra-rational conception of the social contract that\nappears to lie behind some of the claims of the TTP.\n\n\nHowever, Spinoza\u2019s account of the state as the spontaneous product of\nnatural passions is perfectly consistent with the psychological\ninterpretation of the contract (\u00a73.6, above). Indeed, he seems to\nsupport such a view in his work when he claims that individuals are\nunder the right [sub potestate] of the commonwealth (3/5), regardless of whether they\nobey its laws from fear or love of civic order (2/10; 3/8). They stand\nunder the right or power of the sovereign, because they are held (psychologically) in its sway.\n\n\nBut what exactly does it mean to deduce the foundations of the state\nfrom the nature of men? In the TP Spinoza tells us that men, who are\nindividually weak and effectively powerless compared to the aggregated\npowers of others (2/15; Cf. EIVP5dem.), come together as a\nresult of \u201csome common emotion...a common hope, or common fear,\nor desire to avenge some common injury\u201d (6/1; see Matheron 1969\nand 1990). The state is thus an unintended, but salutary, outcome of\nthe natural interplay of human passions. In this sense, the civil\ncondition is a natural condition.  Because, on this view, stable\npatterns of behavior emerge from blind interplay of the passions,\nthereby overcoming coordination problems, some have regarded Spinoza\u2019s\naccount as \u201cevolutionary,\u201d anticipating the theory of\nunintended consequences found in Mandeville, Smith, and Hayek (Den Uyl\n1985 and 1983). However, Spinoza says precious little about the\nprocess of civil formation itself in the TP, making such an\ninterpretation deeply underdetermined, at best. While one can, like\nDen Uyl (ibid.) or Matheron (1969, 1990), construct a genetic story on\nthe basis of Spinozistic psychology, the account that Spinoza himself\noffers is quite thin.\n",
