    "main_text": "The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality || Bootstrapping and Detachment\n3.1 Bootstrapping and Detachment\n\nPerhaps the most widely discussed challenge for the normativity of\nstructural rationality is the worry that the assumption of reasons for\nconforming to structural requirements would license implausible forms\nof \u201cbootstrapping\u201d or detachment (see esp. Bratman 1981,\nBroome 2001a, Kolodny 2005, and cf. \u00a71.1 above). As we already\nsaw in \u00a72.1, a narrow-scope account of structural requirements\nplus the assumption that rationality is normative seems to yield\nunacceptable bootstrapping. For example, it suggests that merely by\nbelieving\u00a0that she ought to extinguish all human life, Ava can\nmake it the case that she ought to, or at least has reason to, intend\nto extinguish all human life. As we again saw in \u00a72.1, some take\nthis as an objection to the narrow-scope view. Others, however, take\nit as an argument that structural rationality cannot be normative\n(Kolodny 2005).\n\nIn support of the latter way of going, some have argued that a\nnormative interpretation of structural requirements licenses\nimplausible detachment even on the wide-scope view. Such arguments\ntypically appeal to certain transmission principles \u2013 which are\n(roughly speaking) principles about how reasons are transmitted from\nends to means (see also the entry on\n instrumental rationality,\n section 2). A prominent instance is Raz\u2019s argument against the\nwide-scope instrumental requirement (Raz 2005). The argument is based\non what is sometimes called a \u201cliberal\u201d principle of\nreasons transmission, which says (roughly) that for every means that\nfacilitates or probabilizes doing what we have reason to do, there is\na derivative reason to take this means (Raz 2005; Bedke 2009; Kolodny\n2018). Because wide-scope requirements are symmetric, both dropping\nthe antecedent attitude-state as well as adopting the consequent\nattitude-state are (highly effective) means to conforming to the\nrequirement. Therefore, if there is a reason to conform to wide-scope\nrequirements, it follows from the liberal transmission principle that\nwe can detach a reason to adopt the consequent attitude-state (as well\nas a reason to drop the antecedent attitude-state). Again, we end up\nwith the unwanted result that Ava has a reason to intend to extinguish\nall human life. If this argument is sound, opting for a wide-scope\nrather than a narrow-scope account of structural requirements does not\navoid the problem with detachment. However, some reject the liberal\ntransmission principle on which the argument is based, at least in\nfull generality (Broome 2005; Way 2010; Rippon 2011; Kiesewetter and\nGertken 2021).\n\nA different argument to the effect that even wide-scope normative\nrequirements of structural rationality license implausible detachment\nis based not on the liberal transmission principle, but on the weaker\nprinciple that reasons transmit to necessary means (Setiya\n2007, who partly draws on Greenspan 1975). The problem is that an\nagent may be psychologically incapable of altering one of her\nantecedent attitudes, which renders adopting the consequent attitude a\nnecessary means for conforming to the wide-scope requirement. For\nexample, if Ava is unable to give up her belief that she ought to\nextinguish all human life, then intending to extinguish all human life\nis a necessary means to conforming to the wide-scope enkratic\nrequirement. Thus, if Ava has reason to conform to this requirement,\nthe necessary means transmission principle entails that we can detach\na reason to intend to extinguish all human life once again. As before,\nhowever, some reject the transmission principle on which this argument\nis based (Broome 2013; but see Kiesewetter 2015 for replies). Others\n(Bratman 2009b) have replied to the argument by suggesting that the\ngeneral reason to satisfy structural requirements \u2013 which in\nBratman\u2019s view, is one of self-governance \u2013 is not\noperative in cases where the agent is psychologically unable to alter\ntheir attitudes (but see Brunero 2010; 2020: Ch. 5; Kiesewetter 2017:\nCh. 5 for challenges for Bratman\u2019s view).\n",
