Usually,\nobjects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at\nsome later time. But what is it for an object to exist in time? Do\nonly present objects exist, as a presentist would have it, or\nis existence to be understood in a broader sense comprising past and\nfuture objects as well, as an eternalist would hold? The\ncontroversy between presentism and eternalism is\naccompanied by a debate on persistence, that is, on the\nquestion how objects exist through time. Are objects wholly present at\neach instant at which they exist \u2014 a view known as\nendurantism \u2014 or do they persist by having different\ntemporal stages at different instants in time \u2014 a view called\nperdurantism? For a detailed overview of these debates, see\ne.g.\u00a0Dyke and Bardon (2013), Meyer (2013), as well as the entries\non\n time,\n temporal parts, and\n identity over time.\n\nSimilar questions concerning the existence of objects in time and\ntheir identity over time arise in the context of first-order temporal\nlogics, albeit under a different guise. These questions become\nparticularly important when it comes to the interaction of temporality\nand quantification. For example, the sentence \u201cA philosopher\nwill be a king\u201d can be interpreted in several different ways,\nsuch\n as[5]\n\n\n\n\\(\\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land {F} \\, king({x}))\\)\n\nSomeone who is now a philosopher will be a king at some future\ntime.\n\n\\(\\exists {x}{F} (philosopher({x})\\land king({x}))\\)\n\nThere now exists someone who will at some future time be both a\nphilosopher and a king.\n\n\\({F} \\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land {F}\\, king({x}))\\)\n\nThere will exist someone who is a philosopher and later will be a\nking.\n\n\\({F} \\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\\land king({x}))\\)\n\nThere will exist someone who is at the same time both a\nphilosopher and a king.\n\n\nThe interpretations given above assume that the domain of\nquantification is always relative to a time instant and that the same\nindividual may exist at multiple times. To enable these\ninterpretations, we need to introduce in the models a local\ndomain of objects \\({D}({t})\\) for each time instant \\(t\\), to\nrestrict the range of the quantifiers to that domain, and to identify\nthe same object across different times.\n\nMoreover, the example above suggests that the local domain at a given\ntime instant contains exactly those individuals that do in fact exist\nat that instant. From a logical point of view, however, there are\nalternative ways how to think of the local domains associated with\ntime instants, which mirror different conceptions of existence in\ntime. Here are four natural options:\n\n\n\nObjects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at a\nlater time, i.e., they actually exist only over a certain period of\ntime. This idea can be formally captured by assuming that the local\ndomain at a given time instant comprises those, and only those,\nobjects that presently exist at that instant. Thus, objects belong to\nthe local domains of precisely those instants at which they actually\nexist, and the local domains accordingly vary over time.\n\n\nObjects actually exist over a period of time, but they remain in the\ntemporal history of the world once they have ceased to actually exist.\nOn this account, the local domain at an instant includes not only\nthose objects that presently exist but all past objects as well. That\nis, the local domains increase as time progresses and new objects come\ninto being.\n\n\nAlternatively, one may hold that all objects that will ever exist are\ninitially part of the temporal history of the world but drop out once\nthey have ceased to actually exist. Technically, this amounts to the\nidea that the local domain at an instant comprises all present and\nfuture objects. Thus, the local domains decrease as time progresses\nand objects go out of being.\n\n\nPast, present, and future objects likewise exist. This is the notion\nof existence in an eternalist sense. One way to formally capture this\nidea is by requiring that the local domain associated with a time\ninstant contains all objects that are part of the temporal history of\nthe world. Hence, the local domains remain constant over\ntime.\n\n\nA conceptually different but technically closely related issue\nconcerns the scope of quantification. What do we quantify over in a\ntemporal setting?\n\n\n\nOnly over those objects that presently exist at the current time\ninstant, as presupposed in the above example?\n\n\nOver all present, past, and future objects in the temporal history of\nthe world?\n\n\nAdopting the terminology \u2018actualist quantification\u2019 and\n\u2018possibilist quantification\u2019 by Fitting and Mendelsohn\n(1998) to the temporal case, we may refer to the first kind of\nquantification as presentist quantification and use the term\neternalist quantification for the latter. Depending on the\nchoice between these options, the sentence \u201cEvery human is born\nafter 1888\u201d, for instance, can be true or false. It is true if\nwe quantify only over those humans that are currently alive; but it is\nfalse if we quantify over all humans in the temporal history of the\nworld, including those that have ever lived. A further issue arising\nhere concerns fictitious entities, such as Santa Claus or Pippi\nLongstocking, which do not actually exist at any time instant. Still,\nthey may be said to exist in a broader sense, and one may want to\ninclude them in the domain of quantification. We set this issue aside\nhere and refer the reader to the entry on free logic, which is a logic that allows reference to non-existing entities (cf. also Section 8.6).\n\nMany of the questions concerning the interrelation of existence and\nquantification arising here correspond to well known problems in modal\nfirst-order logics, where an extensive discussion on these issues\nstarted already with Frege and Russell and peaked in the 1940s-1950s\nin the works of R. Barcan-Marcus, R. Carnap, W. Quine, R. Montague,\nand others (see the entry on\n modal logic).\n A central issue in first-order modal logics relates to the validity or\ninvalidity of the so-called Barcan formula, a temporal version of\nwhich intuitively says: \u201cIf at some time in the future there\nwill be something that is \\(Q\\), then there is something now that will\nbe \\(Q\\) at some time in the future.\u201d Whether this statement is\nguaranteed to be true crucially depends on how the local domains at\nthe various instants in time are construed and what our quantifiers\nrange over. What is more, temporal logic yields two versions of the\nBarcan formula, one for the future and one for the past.\n",
