    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Negro Spirituals\n5.3 The Negro Spirituals\n\nIn Locke's estimation, the spirituals are the quintessential Negro\ncontribution to American art and culture; manifesting as they do so\nmuch, not only about the North American Negro and his aesthetic and\ncultural heritage and evolution, but also in standing as a paragon of\nprocesses of aesthetic transition and development.\n\nThe spirituals are really the most characteristic product of the race\ngenius as yet in America. But the very elements which make them\nuniquely expressive of the Negro make them at the same time deeply\nrepresentative of the soil that produced them. Thus, as unique\nspiritual products of American life, they become nationally as well as\nracially characteristic. It may not be readily conceded now that the\nsong of the Negro is America's folksong; but if the spirituals are\nwhat we think them to be, a classical folk expression, then this is\ntheir ultimate destiny. Already they give evidence of this classic\nquality. Through their immediate and compelling universality of\nappeal, through their untarnishable beauty, they seem assured of the\nimmortality of those great folk expressions that survive not so much\nthrough being typical of a group or representative of a period as by\nvirtue of being fundamentally and everlastingly human. (NN 199)\n\n\nThe best evidence, Locke seems to think, in support of the spirituals'\nclaim to universality is that they have withstood the test of time. As\nan art form they have outlived not only the generations that produced\nthem but the peculiar social environment that enlivened them. Beyond\nthis the spirituals have survived\n\nthe contempt of the slave owners, the conventionalizations of formal\nreligion, the repressions of Puritanism, the corruptions of\nsentimental balladry, and the neglect and disdain of second-generation\nrespectability. (NN 199)\n\n\nIn short, they have successfully made the transition from folk art to\nformal music.\n\nThe spirituals at once exemplify all of the three major themes of\nLocke's aesthetic philosophy: they are expressive of the individuality\nof a given artist\u2014think of the distinctiveness of Paul Robeson's\nbaritone renderings of \u201cSwing Low, Sweet Chariot\u201d; they\nhave universal human appeal; and they epitomize the process of\ntransition from a folk art to high or classical art. \u201cIn its\ndisingenuous simplicity, folk art is always despised and rejected at\nfirst; but generations after, it flowers again and transcends the\nlevel of its origin\u201d (NN 199).\n\nNegro folk music or spirituals contain the raw material for myriad new\nmusical developments. That material was at the time of the publication\nof The New Negro to Locke's mind underdeveloped, but as Negro\nartists grew in sophistication and craft Locke saw the potential for\nthem to complete the conversion of so fundamentally American and\npedestrian an art form into an avenue for insight into some of the\nmost deeply emotional aspects of humanity.\n\nLocke credits Du Bois with being among the first to give the\nspirituals \u201ca serious and proper social interpretation,\u201d\nwith his chapter in The Souls of Black Folks on the Sorrow\nSongs. \u201cBut underneath the broken words, childish imagery,\npeasant simplicity, lies\u201d Locke notes\n\nas Dr. Du Bois pointed out, and epic intensity and a tragic profundity\nof emotional experience, for which the only historical analogy is the\nspiritual experience of the Jews and the only analogue, the Psalms.\n(NN 200)\n\n\nBut whatever they may lack in terms of poetic form, they more than\ncompensate for in their ability to embody the religious mood. This\nNorth American Negro folk form is replete with the spirit of\nexaltation. The spirituals are remarkable for their ability to\ntranscend the profound tragedy that gives birth to them and offer up a\nmodel of enduring hopefulness in this world or the next. \u201cTheir\nwords are colloquial,\u201d Locke notes, being the products of\nunlettered folk \u201cbut their mood is epic\u201d giving emotive\nexpression to experiences that exemplify the possibilities of humanity\nat its best (NN 201). The spirituals \u201care primitive, but their\nemotional artistry is perfect\u201d (NN 201).\n\nHistorically, Negro colleges were the mechanism through which the\nspirituals were popularized. The travelling choirs of Negro\ninstitutions such as Hampton University, Wilberforce University, Fisk\nUniversity and Tuskegee University performed the spirituals across the\ncountry as a means of raising funds for their respective institutions,\nall the while bringing to black and white audiences in the United\nStates knowledge and appreciation of this indigenous musical form.\nMany of these university choirs also recorded compilations of Negro\nspirituals and published them. It was thus, as Locke has it, that the\nspirituals were able to avoid simply falling out of fashion and\nfailing to survive \u201cthat critical period of disfavor in which\nany folk product is likely to be snuffed out by the false pride of the\nsecond-generation\u201d (NN 202). This, by Locke's lights, is not an\nuncommon situation for folk arts to face, finding it necessary as they\noften do to resist being disavowed by subsequent generations wishing\nto distance themselves from the supposedly deficient quality of the\nfolk expression.\n\nEmotions and attitudes form the very foundation of Locke's philosophy\nof value: undoubtedly, one reason that Locke was so enamored with the\nspirituals was that as he understood them their primary artistic\nvirtue was their deeply emotive character. \u201cEmotionally,\u201d\nhe points out, \u201cthese songs are far from simple\u201d (NN 205).\nThere is to be found in the spiritual folk music of the American Negro\nthe entire range of human moods and emotions, and within a given\nspiritual there can be a drastic change in mood from the deepest\nsorrow to glorious praise, as each and every song is infused with\nreligious sentiment. Surprisingly, when it comes to the problem of\nclassification of the spirituals, Locke does not insist upon the\nprimary mode of classification being the feeling-quality of the song\nas his value theory might suggest. In fact, Locke argues that\n\n[i]nteresting and intriguing as was Dr. Du Bois's analysis of their\nemotional themes, modern interpretation must break with that mode of\nanalysis, and relate these songs to the folk activity that they\nmotivated, classifying them by their respective song-types. (NN 205)\n\n\nIn the case of the spirituals Locke is in favor of a different method\nof classification because contemporary interpreters of the Negro's\nmusic tend to mischaracterize, or characterize in a way that is not\ntrue to the folk that produced it, the music of the Negro. Locke\nlaments the fact that \u201cat present many a half secularized ballad\nis mistaken for a \u2018spiritual,\u2019 and many a camp-meeting\nshout for a folk hymn\u201d (NN 205). He believed the folk music of\nthe Negro is best categorized according to the sort of activity they\ninspired. \u201cFrom this point of view\u201d Locke claims\n\nwe have essentially four classes, the almost ritualistic prayer songs\nfor pure spirituals, the freer and more unrestrained evangelical\nshouts or Meeting songs, the folk ballad so overlaid with the\ntradition of the spirituals proper that the distinctive type quality\nhas almost been unnoticed until late, and the work and labor songs of\nstrictly secular character. (NN 205)\n\n\nHowever, discriminating Negro folk music into types on the basis of\nthe folk activity that underlies them is not necessarily to exclude\nthe emotive content of the song. In fact, it seems that what is really\nbeing discriminated is the active expression of the underlying\nemotional content, i.e., the activity that is most commonly associated\nwith a particular emotion or mood. And here we see perhaps the most\ndirect effect that Locke's axiology has on his assessment of\nspirituals discriminating them as he does into types in terms of their\nfeeling-quality, but also linking each form with a set of imperatives\nin this case, a practical imperative understood by the type of\nactivity that each song is used to motivate.\n\nLocke sees as a major problem with the scholarship on Negro folk music\nin his day the tendency to overemphasize one of the various\ndistinctive elements of the music over the others. The result was a\njaundiced view of Negro music. \u201cStrain out and emphasize the\nmelodic element\u201d Locke informs\n\nand you get only the sentimental ballad; emphasize the harmonic idiom,\nand you get a cloying sentimental glee; overemphasize the rhythmic\nidiom and instantly you secularize the product into syncopated dance\nelements.
